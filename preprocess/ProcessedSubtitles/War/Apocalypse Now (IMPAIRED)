 This is the end 
 Beautiful friend 
 This is the end 
 My only friend 
 The end 
 Of our elaborate plans 
 The end 
 Of everything that stands 
 The end 
 No safety or surprise 
 The end 
 Again 
 So limitless and free 
 Desperately in need 
 Of some stranger's hand 
 ln a desperate land 
 Lost in a Roman 
 Wilderness of pain 
 And all the children 
 Are insane 
 All the children 
 Are insane 
 It's the Central Highlands AFVN 
 Man, it's really hot 
 I can't get no 
 Satisfaction 
 I can't get no 
 Satisfaction 
 'Cause I try 
 And I try 
 And I try 
 And I try 
 I can't get no 
 I can't get no 
 Come on, baby 
 Oh, Suzie Q 
 Oh, Suzie Q 
 Suzie Q 
 I like the way you walk 
 I like the way you talk 
 I like the way you walk 
 I like the way you talk 
 My Suzie Q 
 Whoa, Suzie Q 
 Whoa, Suzie Q 
 Oh, Suzie Q 
 Baby, I love you 
 Suzie Q 
 Come on, yeah
