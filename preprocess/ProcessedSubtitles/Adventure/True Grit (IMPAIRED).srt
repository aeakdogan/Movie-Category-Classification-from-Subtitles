sound of horse galloping
Sound of train's wheels clacking on rails
Sobs
Sobs louder
Man continues to sob
Crowd gasps
Crowd begins to clap
Bangs on outhouse
Loud snoring
Sound of men talking
Audience laughs
Jingling of spurs
Loud snoring
Jingle of spurs
Draw on a pipe
Spurs jingle and ring loudly
Switch slaps, Mattie cries
Fire crackles
Horse snorting
Donkey braying and crying
Donkey snorting and braying
Door slams shut
Branch creaks
Rooster speaks to rider
Distant gun shot
Wind whistling in trees
Sound of approaching horse
Pots and pans rattling
Men begin coughing inside
Roof creeks under Mattie's feet
Gunshot through roof
Coughing
Coughs hard
Fireplace crackles and snaps
Whispers
Sound of Horse nickering
Sound of jingling spurs
Rooster panting hard
La Boeuf tries to scream something
Rooster Sings "Greer County"
Rooster hums Greer County
Bullet ricochets in mine
La Boeuf coughing
Voice breaks
Sound of rushing water ahead
Boots splash in water
Horse knickers
Dropped bucket splashes
Groans
Shouts
Man gobbles like turkey
Man continues to gobble like turkey
Man moo's like a cow
Gun shot echoes in distance
Baa's like goat in reply
Mattie coughs
Horse cries out
Click of his gun locking
Shot echoes
Cloth ripping
Faint sound of a rattle
Rattle grows stronger
Rattling growing louder
Hiss, Mattie screams
Crickets chirping
Little Blackie panting
Little Blackie panting harder
Blackie screams
Little Blackie cries out
Little Blackie struggles to breath
Roosters breathing grows faster
Rooster panting hard
Rooster struggles to catch breath
Grown up Mattie narrates
Wail of a train whistle
Trains engine chugs faster
