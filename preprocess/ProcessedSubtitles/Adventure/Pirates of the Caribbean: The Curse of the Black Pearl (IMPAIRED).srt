 Elizabeth singing softly 
 Knock on door 
 Coins jingling 
 Mid-tempo march playing 
 Mid-tempo march playing 
 Breathing heavily 
 Snoring 
 Hiss, donkey brays 
 Whistling 
 Creaking, wind howling 
 Thud in distance 
 Banging on door 
 Man shouting 
 Whistles 
 Door closes 
 Thud, men shouting 
 Monkey chatters 
 Laughter 
 Door opens 
 Screeches 
 Screeches 
 Laughs 
 Laughter 
 Squawks 
 Chanting 
 Chanting stops
