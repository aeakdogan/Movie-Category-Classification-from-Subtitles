Cole Porter's "Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love" Cole Porter's "You've Got That Thing" Joséphine Baker's "La Conga Blicoti" Good evening, everyone! A small shot of bourbon, please. To meet some friends on Saint-Germain. How much, sir? €18,000 Thanks. No. I don't agree. But why? Because... No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly. You don't know Adriana. Look... Look at the motion, the painting. It's exactly what she represents! No. You're wrong. Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo! No, no! It's true if you know her! Yes, with you, in private, No. No. I do not agree. Mmm. Me, too. Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me" You like? Good evening, Madame. There she is, my little Adriana! You are both perfect. She chose Pablo. Let's take another drink. You are a poet. Sir? It's a shame. It's a shame. Dalí, yes? A bottle of red wine! Another glass for this man, please. Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis! I knew that I had an obsession with that bully! We talked about all this! I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted. Cole Porter's "Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love" €18 For me? Good evening. It's one of your best, until now. I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it. Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to... Sir, Miss, away we go! Who are you? Come up. We're too late Good evening! Good evening! Welcome. Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress! So ahead of the time! Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party! Yes? Good evening. We are great fans. Thank you, Madame. May we offer you a drink? I would be delighted. Have a seat. You are American? I could tell from the accent. Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do. May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas. No, sir. He speaks a little. No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see? ...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination. It's the golden age! Not at all. The Renaissance is much better. What is it you do? I study high fashion. That's why you're dressed like that. I understand now! The youthful clothes. Would you introduce her to Richard? Oh, yes! So, you're interested? May I? To whom do I owe the honor? I...I'm lost. I made a wrong turn. Guards! Guards! Off with his head! Off with his head!
