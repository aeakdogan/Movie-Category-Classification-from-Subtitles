Bluesy romantic music
Alice singing bluesy romantic song
Dog barking
Alice singing bluesy romantic song
Song echoing eerily
Door slams
Upbeat rock music playing loudly
Music stops
Donald spluttering
Crashing
Clattering
Alice exclaims in exasperation
Upbeat instrumental music
Mimics Donald
TV chattering
Sobbing
Telephone ringing

Sirens wailing
Humming
Singing romantic song
Alice continues singing
Both crying
Alice exclaims
Soft rock music
Tommy booing
Soft rock music continues
TV chattering
Banging on door
Alice sighing
