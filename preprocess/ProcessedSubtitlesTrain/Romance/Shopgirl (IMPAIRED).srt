LAUNDERLAND: COIN-OP LAUNDRY
If you do want me..
..give me little sugar
If you don't want me..
..don't lead me on, girl
But if you need me..
..show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling blue
And I want you
There's just one thing that you should do.
Just give me some kind of sign, oh baby..
To show me that you're mine, girl.
Oh, yeah!
To show me you're mine..
Good night!
Good night..!
Here she comes, breaking through my window..
..in the early morning hours.
For the moment..
..I'm disrupted.
But in time she'll make me smile.
All the wondrous anim--
--bring us songs of calm.
They do no wrong.
They do no wrong.
You don't know just how much I miss you.
Yeah, my stomach aches in your absence.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hey, it's Jeremy.
Jeremy. What are you doing?
Yeah. Come over, I'm waiting for you to come over.
It's not too late.
Hi, it's Ray Porter, leave a message after the beep.
Relax.
Relax your toes and breathe.
Relax your ankles and breathe.
Feel your hands, flex them.
Fix your eyes on an object in front of you.
Quiet your mind. Feel the sensation of being alive.
I don't know what it is that makes me love you so..
I only know I never wanna let you go..
'Cause you started something..
Oh, can't you see..
..that ever since we met you've had a hole on me.
It happens to be true.
I only wanna be with you.
It doesn't matter where you go and what you do.
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you.
Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss.
I never knew that I could be in love like this.
It's crazy but it's true.
I only wanna be with you.
You stopped and smiled at me.
Asked if I'd care to dance.
I fell into your open arms..
..and I didn't stand a chance.
Now listen, honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere.
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care.
'Cause you started something..
..oh, can't you see?
That ever since we met you've had a hole on me.
No matter what you do..
..I only wanna be with you!
Feel the sensation of being alive.
Feel what it means to be alive.
Only from this place, of pure existence can you begin to change..
..to turn yourself into a being, capable of loving another person.
LOVE, RAY
Ray, it's counsellor--
Hey, Ray--
This is a call for Mr. Ray Porter--
Eight weeks on tonight still
But all the other winters I spent
She lived in a house..
..where mission street bends.
I had stayed in there, watching you
hanging holds of cigarette
She tells me her name
And once again I'm with her 'cause
Somewhere in my heart
Is a love that--
my treat
