 Grunting 
 Arm cracks 
 Screams 
 Screaming 
 Theme music playing 
 Fanfare 
 Man yells 
 Horse neighs 
 Man shouting 
 Grunts 
 Distant bell tolling 
 Laughs 
 Kids laughing 
 Boys crying 
 Woman moaning 
 Moaning continues 
 Soft moaning 
 Moaning 
 Louder moans 
 Climaxes 
 Footsteps approaching 
 Chuckles 
 Snorts 
 Neighs 
 Neighing continues 
 Soft chuckle 
 Laughs 
 Gurgling cough 
 Feeble laughter 
 Choked laugh 
 Door closes 
 Speaking Dothraki 
 Groans 
 Chatter and market noises 
 Men shout 
 Growls 
 Spits 
 Thunder rumbles 
 Laughs 
 Knocks 
 Gate rattling 
 Barks 
 Wind gusting 
 Unison 
 Soft sobs 
 Riders cheering 
 Shouting 
 Bells tolling 
 Sighs 
 Scoffs
