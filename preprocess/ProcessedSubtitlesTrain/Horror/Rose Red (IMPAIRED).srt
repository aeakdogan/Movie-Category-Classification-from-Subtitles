 Theme from "A Summer Place" 
 music blasting 
 children laughing 
 music blasting 
 door rattles 
 humming to music 
 rumbling 
 loud music continues 
 humming 
 rumbling 
 Annie sings 
 screaming 
 Mrs. Stanton screams 
 door shaking 
 music stops 
 crows caw 
 laughter 
 class chuckles 
 sighing 
 telephone rings 
 rings 
 rings 
 rings 
 door opens 
 door closes 
 door slams 
 loud knocking 
 knocking 
 bell chimes 
 phone rings 
 dial tone 
 creaking 
 "In The Mood" plays 
 whispering 
 music stops 
 whispering 
 whispering continues 
 whispering 
 baby crying 
 phone ringing 
 glass breaking 
 radio switches on 
 country music playing 
 chuckling 
 whispering continues 
 whispering 
 whispering 
 gate creaking 
 crows cawing 
 door creaks open 
 gasps 
 bees buzzing 
 bees buzzing 
 cell phone rings 
 loud music playing 
 continues ringing 
 phone ringing 
 beep 
 whispering 
 whispering 
 whispering 
 whispering 
 whispering continues 
 whispering
