over radio
loud thud, tires squealing
car alarms blaring
car engines hissing
car door squeaks open
laughing
Rayburn panting, gunfire
Rayburn moaning
Sanchez panting
helicopter whirrs in distance
panting
loud chanting outside
cell phone ringing
door being kicked in
protestors chanting outside
horn honks
traffic passing by
vehicle approaching
Sanchez sighs
classical music playing
door squeaking
speaking Pashto
repeats what Sanchez just said
both laugh
sighs
crickets chirping
crickets chirping
static hissing
crickets chirping
crowd chatter
club music playing
techno-pop playing
sighs
door locking
panting
crickets chirping
vehicle approaching
car door closes
gunshot
gunshot
car door closes
classical music playing
over radio
loud thud, tires squealing
unzipping duffel bag
