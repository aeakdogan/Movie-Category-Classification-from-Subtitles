fanfare plays
hushed
theme song playing
horse whinnying
Adam, Hoss clear their throats
horse whinnies
both laugh
horse whinnying
indistinct shouting, goading
groans
door closes
sighs softly
laughs
clapping, murmuring
crowd murmuring
crowd murmuring
murmuring continues
horseshoe clanks
hoofbeats approaching
chuckles
chuckles
laughing
horse whinnies
door opening
Ben sighs
Ben chuckles
chuckles softly
yawns
door opens
sighs
quietly
grunts
door opens
punch lands
hoofbeats approaching
sighs
