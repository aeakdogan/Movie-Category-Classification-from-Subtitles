sighs
mouth full
panting
gunshots
grunts
drops gun
quietly
voice breaking
theme song playing
scoffs
cocks gun
sobbing
door opens
door closes
chuckles
neighing

gun clicking
glass breaks
door opens
gasping
Ben gasping
grunts
hoofbeats clopping past
door opens
knocking on door
gun clicks
Dianne gasps
