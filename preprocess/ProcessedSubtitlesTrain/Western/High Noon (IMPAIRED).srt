Theme song begins
Church bell ringing
Crowd claps
Knock on door
Snoring
Knock on door
Knock on door
Knock on door
In Spanish
Crowd begins laughing
Knock on door
Knock on door
Playing tune on harmonica
Hammering in distance
Train whistle blows
Train whistle
Train whistle
Train whistle
Bells clinging
Gunshot
Gunshot
Gunfire
Gunfire
