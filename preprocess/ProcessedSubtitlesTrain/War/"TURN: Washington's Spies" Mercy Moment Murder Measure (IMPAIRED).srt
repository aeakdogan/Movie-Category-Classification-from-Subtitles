 Body splashes 
 Chuckles 
 grunting 
 Chains rattling 
 Whispers 
 Louder 
 bird caws 
 door creaks open 
 rocking chair creaking 
 creaking continues 
 gasps 
 Quietly 
 Door closes 
 dishes clatter 
 Cup clatters 
 snoring 
 Quietly 
 Seagulls squawking 
 door closes 
 clatters 
 Pub patrons chattering 
 gasps 
 Panting 
 quietly 
 Quietly 
 Thuds 
 Anna ascends stairs 
 Kisses 
 grunts 
 Yells, gasping 
 laughing 
 Choking 
 grunting 
 Sighs 
 Chuckles 
 Caleb laughs 
 sighs 
 Sighs 
 Whispers 
 Singing drunkenly 
 Singing continues 
 breathing heavily 
 gasps 
 Footsteps descending stairs 
 clicks 
 clicks 
 Anna breathing heavily 
 cocks gun 
 Whistling 
 Scoffs 
 Sighs 
 Music playing
