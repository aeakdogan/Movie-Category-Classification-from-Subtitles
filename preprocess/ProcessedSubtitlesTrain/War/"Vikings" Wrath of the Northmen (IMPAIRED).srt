dirt crunching underfoot
Dog barks in the distance
Loud buzz of chatter
Laughing and protesting
Young men protest, upset
Everyone quiets down
Men scoff, chuckle
Men laugh
Murmurs of agreement
Chuckles softly
Murmurs of agreement
Happy
Men chuckle
Low murmurs
Laughs
Quietly
Hooves thud
Birds cry overhead
Water splashes
Whispering
Heavy, excited breathing
Moaning
Panting breaths
Defeated sigh
Olafur gasping in fear
Gasping in fear
Spits
Axe chop loudly
Cup drops on the floor
Sighs, slightly drunk
Fighting grunts
Fighting grunts
Panting
Struggling grunts
Hard punch
Kissing
Laughs
Ragnar collects his breath
Hard slap
Ragnar breathes hard
Water drips in the basin
Laughs
Bird chirps
Water rushes nearby
Water babbles loudly
Raven cries
Laughs
Cart rattles
Water drips and splashes
Water drips and splashes
Blows nose in water
Blows nose in water
Water drips and splashes
Blows nose in water
Weapons clatter, crates clunk
Chatter in distance
Gulls cry
Slave girl gasps, frightened
Gasps in fear
Birds chirp
Rollo exhales
Water laps at the shore
Sharpening blade
Waves splash
Waves splash
Wind gusts, mast creaks
Ragnar chuckles
Ragnar laughs, excitedly
Fire crackles
Sea churns
Loud crack of thunder
Grunts of effort
Huge wave splashes
Loud crack of thunder
Loud crack of thunder
Murmurs of concern
Loud crack of thunder
Thunder booms loudly
Thunder booms
Wave crashes
Laughing hysterically
Speaking ancient anglo Saxon
Thunder booms
Thunder booms
Firmly
Hammer strikes iron bar
Steam hisses
Struggling grunts
Screams
Blacksmith screams
Water lapping
Warrior pants, exhausted
grunts, thunks on the floor
Ravens cawing
Waves lap against the boat
Fluttering of wings
Gulls cry overhead
Laughs delightedly
Waves lap against the boat
Singing in Latin
Singing in Latin
Singing continues
Waves crash, distant yells
Basket crashes on the beach
Bird caws
Door bangs shut
Bangs his shield
Everyone joins in
Sheep bleat as they scatter
Bell clangs loudly
Iron tools tap
Start praying in Latin
Geese honk
Praying in Latin
Listening to the prayers
Litany of prayers
Litany of prayers
Gasping in fear
The monks cry out, frightened
Terrified screams
Terrified screams
Grunt of effort
Geese honk
Rollo coughs at the stench
Rollo gags, disgusted
Monk screams, terrified
Rollo gags, disgusted
They laugh
Leif and Erik laugh
Clank nearby
Frightened gasps
Gasps, frightened
Shakily
Flips through pages
Snaps book shut
Hard smash
Shaky breathing
Flames crackle
Flames crackle
Flames roar
Waves crash ashore, gulls cry
Waves crash
Waves crash, water sprays
Oars creak
Water churns, oars creak
Shivering
Shivering
Waves crash, water sprays
