Men scream and roar
Horse gallops
Rooster crows, sheep bleat
Saxon warrior pants
Foliage crunches underfoot
Excited
Foliage rustles, branches and twigs snap
Birds chirp
Birds chirp
Groans
Sighs
Steely
Startled grunt
Men laugh
Blade rings as it's sharpened
Leif sighs
Church bells clang
Struggling grunts
Axes thunk into place
Feet thud on the palisade
Geese honk, wings beat
Footsteps crunch
Geese honk nervously
Banging, wood clatters
Floki giggles
Doors bang open, saxons cry out, shocked
Saxons murmur nervously
Weapons slash and slice
Women scream in fear
Saxons murmur, frightened
Saxons murmur nervously
In anglo Saxon
Cacophony of voices cry out in protest
Candelabras clank on the ground
Objects clatter and bang, women scream
Door bursts open
Gasps
Man coughs feebly
Frightened gasps
Weak whimper
Water pours
Coughing
Water splashes
Saxons murmur, upset
Spits
Saxons cry out in horror and anguish
Floki spits, saxons cry out in horror
Floki laughs
Doors burst open
Objects clatter and tumble
Utensils clink
Floor creaks, utensils clatter
Unsheathes weapon
Sheathes weapon
Saxons cry out in protest
Saxons scream, horrified
Struggling grunts
Knut grunts
Woman sobs as she struggles
Knut grunts, continuing
Young woman weeps and cries out
Dull thump, Knut grunts
Grunts of effort, weapons clank
Lagertha grunts in pain
Fabric rips, clothing rustles
Hard thump, Knut grunts in pain
Hard stab
Knut cries out, makes gurgling sounds
Hard stab, Knut grunts in pain
Breathing rapidly
Knut thumps on ground
Horn bellows
Chuckles and sighs, pleased
Loot clatters and clanks, water splashes
Waves crash ashore, seagulls cry
Dragging sound
Sighs with relief
Loot clatters and clanks
Waves crash ashore
Readying inhale
Shields thump into place
Arrows whoosh
Gasps
Yelling command
Screaming war cries
Soldiers crash into shield wall
Men shouting, roaring, and screaming
Weapons ring out, clashing
Men shouting, roaring, and screaming
Arrow whistles
Shouting a viking song
Arrows whoosh
Vikings grunt with renewed effort
Weapons clanging and clanking
Shouting and screaming fills the air
Weapons clashing and hacking
Hard blow, Saxon screams
Hard blow, Saxon screams
Weapons clash and clank
Repeated hard blows
In norse
Men shout and grunt, weapons clash
Vikings roar, advancing
Saxon men scream
Horses whinny and gallop away
Waves wash ashore
Wind gusts, fire crackles
Vikings murmur quietly
Saxon prisoner whimpers
Saxon prisoner gulps
Prisoner grunts
Hard whack
Ale splashes into cup
Cup and bowl crash on the floor
Rough, scratchy rasp
Very quietly
Wind howls outside
Strange rustling and shaking of feathers
Exasperated groan
Seabird cries
Excited shouting in the distance
Chatter excitedly
Crowd buzzes with excitement
Crowd shouts and murmurs excitedly
Crowd hushes
Loot clatters and clanks
shouts
Crowd erupts in cheers
Floki growls
Footsteps approach
Silence
Silence
Door opens
Everyone quiets down
Crowd jeers loudly
Jeering
Sounds of disapproval and disgust
Crowd murmurs

Grunting
Struggling grunts
Hard stab, gurgled grunt
Laughter and merriment halts
Swords ring as they're unsheathed
Attack cry
Men shout and grunt, stabbing and hacking
Fighting grunts, stabbing and hacking
Women cry out
Men shout and grunt, stabbing and hacking
Incessant dripping
Weeping softly
Seabird cries
Wind gusts, seabird shrieks
Chickens cluck, pigs snort
Sheep bleat
Forceful chop
Forceful chop
Axe clatters
Logs thump loudly
Water sloshes
Geese honk noisily
Seabirds cry
The seer laughs
