water drips, muted chanting
Chanting in old norse
Cries out, weeping in agony
Chanting in old norse
Grunting and weeping in agony
Cries out in agony
Grunts and wails in agony
Concerned exhale
Shaky breaths
Distorted chanting
Cries out in pain
Grunts in pain
Panting, relieved
Crying
Baby cries
Baby coos
Waves lap at the shore
Preparatory breaths
Baby fusses
Bites umbilical cord and spits
Sighs
Sighs heavily
Sniffs and sighs dejectedly, baby coos
Baby fusses
Footsteps thud loudly, rain patters
Rain patters loudly
Vicious thud
Shields strike hard, weapons clank
Sword strikes
Axe strikes
Water splashes, swords clash
Blade slashes
Distorted shaky breaths
Axe strike rings, surprised gasp
Blade rings, water splashes
Sword strikes sand
Shaky breaths
Shield splashes
Grunts
Blade rings
Thunder rumbles
Chuckles
Baby coos
Sniffles
Fire crackles
Loud buzz of chatter
Sheep bleat
Fierce wind blows
Water laps gently
Fierce wind blows
Footsteps rustle lightly
Baby fusses
Footsteps retreat
Baby coos
Water flows nearby, birds chirp
Inhales sharply
Baby fusses
Birds chirp, water flows nearby
Metallic scrape
Birds chirp
Relieved exhale
Baby coos softly, Aslaug weeps quietly
Horse whinnies in the distance
horse whinnies, galloping hooves
Galloping hooves thunder loudly
Bells jingle
Shouts of excitement, bells jingle
Chatter excitedly
Doors burst open, royal trumpet bellows
Cheering and applause
Music plays, lively chatter fills hall
Bishop laughs
Distantly
Moans of pleasure
Heavy breathing
Echoing
Loud buzz of chatter
Light clang
Coughs violently
Chuckles
Chairs scrape back
Cups clink
Low, muffled roar, water ripples lightly
Water splashes, Lagertha sighs
Chimes jingle lightly
Animal howls in the distance
Chuckles softly
Slurps
Door creaks open, bathwater sloshes
Water splashes
Breathing heavily
Exhales heavily
Liquid pours
Barking and howling in the distance
Ivar coos
Sharp exhale
Object clatters lightly
Approaching footsteps
Gasps
Grunting, heavy breathing
Gasps and groans, exhausted
Ecbert's breathing slows and steadies
Gasps, turned on
Breathing heavily
Footsteps scuff the floor, door closes
Whispering
Torch fire crackles
Murmurs quietly
Door creaks open
Door bangs closed
banner flaps in the wind
Wind howls
wind howls
Ravens caw
fire crackles
Ivar coos
Ivar coos
choppy water churns
Banner flaps violently in the fierce wind
Seabird cries overhead
Water splashes
Passionate kiss
Gasps
Passionate kiss
footsteps thud
Fierce wind blows
waves crash against the ship
banners flap violently in the fierce wind
horn bellows
Horn bellows
footsteps splash
footsteps thud heavily
Birds chirp
Seabird cries
Seabird cries
Waves roll and crash
Waves crash
Water churns and splashes
Sails fill with wind
Chuckles
Wind blows fiercely
Ship creaks
Ravens croak
Shouts in old norse
Beats drum
Laughs
Oars stroke the waves
Quill rasps
Door creaks open
Door creaks shut
Quill rasps
Rain patters
Foliage rustles underfoot, horse nickers
Foliage rustles underfoot, horse nickers
Axe strikes
Foliage rustles underfoot, rain patters
Thunder rumbles
Slurps
Warriors chatter in the distance
Rain patters
Horses whinny
Grain sifts and scatters
Bells jingle lightly
Hooves thud softly
Grain sifts and scatters
Approaching footsteps
Preparatory exhale
Shields clatter
Foliage rustles underfoot
Bells jingle lightly
Ravens crow in the distance
Foliage rustles underfoot
Soldier shouts a command, horses whinny
grain sifts and scatters
Battle cries rend the air
Men shouting, horses whinnying
Weapons clank, fighting grunts
Crashes on ground
Sword rings as it strikes
sword rings
