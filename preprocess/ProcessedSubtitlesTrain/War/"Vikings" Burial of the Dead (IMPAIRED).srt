Footsteps scuff
Struggling grunts
A loud murmur
Shocked gasps and murmurs
Crowd chuckles
Raining down blows

Tired exhales
Wings flutter
Tired exhales
Groans in pain
Labored breathing
Slices a vein
Shouts
Labored breathing
Exhales his final breaths
Axe slices
Gurgled breaths
Knife slices, pained groans
Waves lap at the shore
Shouts
Low hum of chatter
Everyone quiets down
Pained grunt
Encouraging shouting
Cheering and applause
