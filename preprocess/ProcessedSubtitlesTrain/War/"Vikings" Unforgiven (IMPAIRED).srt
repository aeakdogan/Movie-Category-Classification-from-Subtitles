Bird cries
Birds cry
Oars stroke the water
Water churns
Water pours
Gasps
Whispers quietly
Wind howls
Oars stroke the water, water churns
Wind howls fiercely
Wine pouring
Fire crackles
Chuckles
Chuckles
Exhales, taken aback
Retreating footsteps
Clothes rustle
Approaching footsteps
Fire crackling
Swallows and grunts
Fire crackling
Kissing
Passionate moans
Drunkenly
Loud belch, ale pours
Scoffs
Chuckling
Women quietly withdraw
Sudden thud, cup clatters
Men laugh
Drunken stumble, objects clatter
Drunken stumble, objects clatter
Howling in the distance, owl hoots
Floor creaking
Approaching footsteps
Fearful gasp and exhale
Blows out candle
Door bangs open
Fighting grunts, punching blows
Pained grunts, fighting grunts
Pained grunts
Repeated blows, grunts of effort
Chickens clucking, pigs oinking
Metallic clanking, chickens clucking
Metallic clanking, sheep bleating
Sheep bleats
Chickens cluck, sheep bleat
Foliage rustles underfoot
water flows nearby
Slow, calming breath
Approaching footsteps
Inhales deeply and kisses skull
Birds chirp
Bell tolls
Laughs
Chuckles
Both chuckle
Music slows and becomes muted
Bell tolls
Blood dripping
Gasps in fright
Gasps in fear
Gasps in fear
Birds chirp
Door creaks open
Dust scatters
Seabirds cry out
Water laps gently
Oars stroke the water
Oars stroke the water
Loud buzz of chatter fills the hall
Loud chatter
Chuckles softly
Chuckles, pleased
Chuckles
Loud chatter fills the hall
Giggles
Howling
Music and chatter fill the hall
Gasps in pain
Kiss
Music stops, chatter quiets down
Fabric rips, knife slices through
Gasps and shrieks of horror
Screaming in pain
Unsheathing sword
Horrified gasps
Hard thud
Blood drips
Grunted breath
Whispers fill the hall
Footsteps scuff
Eagle cries
Footsteps scuff
Ominous music
Giggle
Fire crackles
Blade rings, Rollo breathes angrily
Door slams shut
Fire crackles
Gasps awake
Long, slow exhale
Distant echo of bones rattling
Shuddering breath
Echo of bones rattling
Wings beating
Whispering
Whispering
Whispering
Whispering
Running footsteps
Lock clunks shut
Groggy waking murmurs
Men protesting, banging
Fire crackles
Straw catches fire
Alarmed shouting
Shouting
Approaching footsteps
Sniffs
Clothes rustling
Door bursts open
Raven crows ominously
Belt thuds on floor
Attack yell, choked grunt
Heavy breathing
Sighs
Cries out in pain
Struggling grunts
Torvi gasps, borg protests
Light kiss, hard head butt
Repeated blows, pained grunts and groans
Kicking thuds, pained grunts
Grunts of effort, pain grunts
Screams in outrage
Fighting grunts
Screams
Door bursts open
Dragging
Hard thump
Hard kick, grunts in pain
Grunts in pain
Grunts in pain
Ravens crow
Grunting in pain
Pleading
Ravens crow
