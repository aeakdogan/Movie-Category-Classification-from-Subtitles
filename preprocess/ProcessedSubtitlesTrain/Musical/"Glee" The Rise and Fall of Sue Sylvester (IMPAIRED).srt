school bell ringing
cheering
cheering
whoops
Becky crying
phone rings
bell gongs
gasps
clears throat
newscast music playing
deep distorted voice
deep distorted voice
laughs
sighs
laughs softly
dark, dramatic music playing
Laughs
trolley bell dings
music ends
laughs
phone vibrates
slowing
piano plays dramatic melody
rhythmic humming
rhythmic humming
rhythmic humming
music builds
music ends
phone vibrating
"The Final Countdown" resumes
guitars playing rapidly
music ends, crowd cheering
cheering stops abruptly
shrieks
"Rise" begins
rhythmic humming
rhythmic humming
