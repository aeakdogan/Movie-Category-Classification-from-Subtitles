confess
Yes, arguing
gritar!
Yes, you howl!
I want more!
They sing the same time
Mother
He's shy!
One star
Barsa
They sing simultaneously
His nephew was born
My parents moved again
The Arthur is a famous artist
Run always and not lose the air
Run always and not lose the air
Being
It's time to applaud
REPRISE
I'm so exposed
What's left to show?
The doors closed
There is nothing to hide
Yes, you howl!
