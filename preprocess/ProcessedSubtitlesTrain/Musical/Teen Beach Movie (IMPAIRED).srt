Giggles
Music playing
Knocking on door
Scoffs
Sighs
Blows whistle
Whistle continues to blow
Mack coughing
Yelling and whooping
Whispering
Motorcycles revving
Loud revving
Loud revving
Loud revving
Cat yowls
Neck cracks
Snaps fingers
Music stops
Stammering
Laughter
Clears throat
Clears throat
Evil laughter
Gasps
Needle scratches loudly
high-pitched
Goofy laugh
Squeals
Upbeat music begins
Music stops
Music resumes
Music stops
Giggles
All giggling
Shocked gasping
Sighs
Laughter
Delighted shrieking
Chuckles
Evil laughter
Evil laughter
Screams
Muffled singing
Both panting
Tanner gasps
Lela gasps
Both gasping
Sneezes loudly
Evil laughter
All arguing
Arguing
Frightened yelp
Laughs
Evil laughter
gasps
Screaming continues
Laughing
All saying good-bye
Thunder crashing
Laughing
All screaming
