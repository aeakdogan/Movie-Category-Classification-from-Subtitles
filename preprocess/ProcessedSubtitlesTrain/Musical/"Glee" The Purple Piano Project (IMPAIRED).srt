bell rings
bell ringing
singing scales
sneezes
mocking laughter
alarm stops
both giggling
bell ringing
sighs
bell ringing
drawer opens, then closes
bell rings
sighs
"Chopsticks" playing loudly
slamming down keyboard lid
cutters snipping
strings clattering to floor
laughing
bell rings
whistle blows
bell ringing
snaps fingers
chuckling
students yelling
gloved applause
"Big Spender" begins
outrageously off-key
bell ringing
squealing
bell rings
gasps
Rachel laughs
song ends
bell rings
sighing
Kurt gasps, Blaine laughs
song ends
applause
giggles
"Anything Goes" begins
lively orchestral interlude
tap shoes clacking
continues singing note
crying softly
sobs
blows nose
sniffles
thunder rumbling
sniffles
chuckles
sniffles
both laugh
sniffles, sighs
laughs
alarm beeping
bell ringing
chuckles
snaps fingers
bell ringing
cheering
plays three notes
song ends
