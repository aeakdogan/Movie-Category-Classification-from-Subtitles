sizzling
squeals
bell dings
school bell rings
whooping, clapping
school bell rings
school bell rings
laughs
Sara Bareilles' "Brave" begins
school bell rings
En Vogue's "My Lovin'" begins
grunting
sighs
school bell rings
distorted
stammers
distorted
harshly off-key
clears throat
Elliott screams, song ends
laughter
overlapping chatter
grunts
Kurt gasps
phone buzzing
phone buzzing
feedback squeals
sniffling
sighs heavily
chuckles
laughs
gasps
school bell ringing
quietly
weak laugh
all chatting happily
Kurt sighs
