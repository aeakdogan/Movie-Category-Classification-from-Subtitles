gasps
opera music playing
applause
school bell rings
grunting
school bell ringing
school bell ringing
sighs
sighs
knocking
school bell ringing
school bell ringing
like Elvis
laughs
"Something Stupid" begins
in harmony
whispers
school bell rings
sprightly classical piano playing
Rachel laughs
"All That Jazz" playing
faster, brighter
breathily
dancers oohing, aahing
song ends
knock at door
school bell rings
spattering
school bell rings
speaking quietly
light switches clicking, clanking
school bell rings
like Forrest Gump
chamber orchestra tuning up
instruments quiet
applause
chuckling
applause
"Being Good Isn't Good Enough" begins
cheers and applause
laughing
"O Holy Night" begins
song ends
cheers and applause
sighs
sighs
applause
"Being Alive" begins
applause, cheering and whistling
phone buzzing
beep
sighs heavily
school bell ringing
sighs
shivering
