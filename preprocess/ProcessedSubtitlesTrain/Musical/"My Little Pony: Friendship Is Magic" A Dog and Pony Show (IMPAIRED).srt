door opens, bell rings
singsong
shocked gasp
gushing, shrieking
theatrical tone
stammering
voice breaking
giggles
hamming
harp flourish
gasps
dumbstruck
Rarity faints theatrically
chuckles, smugly
theme song begins
My Little Pony
My Little Pony
My Little Pony
gushing
sheepishly
sucking up
strained
Spike digging
licks lips noisily
entranced) You look so...delicious! (drools
admonishing
Spike sighs heavily
jackhammer pounding dirt
Spike shudders happily
Spike slurping and drooling noisily
Spike's heart beats loudly, pigeon cooing
lisping a la LotR's Gollum
singsong
giggles
entranced) Ohhh... (startled
stumbling over words
Spike chuckles nervously
stalling
trembling
giggles nervously
clears throat nervously
dirt shifting
dogs burst out of ground
Rarity shrieks, paw swipes air
jackhammer pounding, diamond dog yelps
Spike yelps
diamond dogs yell, crash into ground in turn
shrill scream
straining
derisive laugh
trails off
gasps
repulsed scream) Dirt! (screams
echoing
Spike hyperventilating into paper bag
hyperventilates) ...Yes, (inhales sharply
in flashback, rapid, panicky speech
ponies gasp in turn
echoing
low growl
Twilight gasps, gags, spits
Rainbow Dash grunts
Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Spike gasp in turn
holes filling with dirt
as holes fill up
Pinkie Pie grunts
Applejack strains, yelps
Rainbow Dash gasps
anxious
harp flourish, wipe to imagination
screams
screams
trails off
crash
Fluttershy grunts
Spike panting, yelps, crashes and grunts
Rainbow Dash grunts
Applejack grunts repeatedly
Applejack gasps
ponies grunt and crash into ground
Twilight yelps, crashes
all panting in exhaustion
imagination wipe
Rarity yelps
Rarity yelps
Rarity shrieks
Rarity swoons
bravado
Spike shushes Twilight
hushed
in Spike's imagination
same voice
guttural growls
blows dog whistle inaudibly
dogs bark
frenzied barking
dogs whine
barking
dogs whine
barking
Spike breathes fire, dogs yelp
Spike breathes fire
heroically
door shatters
modestly
trembling coquettishly
Rarity smacks lips noisily
chuckling
grunts, mouth full
unfazed
all screaming
Pinkie Pie laughs
all grunt in turn as they crash into ground
voice echoing
echoing
Twilight strains, horn poofs
maniacal cackle
lisping
confidently
amused cackle
dryly
exasperated grunt
aggrieved sigh
Rarity paws at ground and whimpers lightly
indignantly
Rarity paws at ground and whimpers
groans
frenzied barking
grunts
sardonically
pleading
repulsed
dryly
leader breathes on hand and sniffs
frustrated
cart drags along ground
dogs digging
scoffs
rock shatters, crashes into ground, dogs whimper
dogs sniffing each other
frazzled
haughtily
ominously
shrill, exaggerated whining
piercing
indignant whining
nervously) Oh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity." (sheepish chuckle
dogs groaning and straining
imitates Rarity whining
hesitantly
shrill, exaggerated whining
slaps Rarity
tearing up
sniffling, voice breaking
Rarity sobs theatrically
whiny sobs
defensively
henpecked
tripping over words
Rarity sobs loudly
groans
Rarity's sobs echo through tunnels
Rarity sobbing
all yelp
Applejack grunts
dogs yelping frantically as they are tossed about
cacophony issues forth from tunnel
bravado
sighs) Fine. (neighs
door shatters
dogs pleading with ponies to make Rarity stop
calmly
pleading
dogs sigh
quizzically
Spike yelps, ponies laugh
