bell rings
Ã  la James Bond
sighs
light applause, whoops
school bell ringing
school bell ringing
groans
Finn sighs
laughter
whispering
school bell ringing
applause
song ends
chuckles
door opens
school bell ringing
both chuckling
The Exciters "Tell Him" begins
song ends, applause
as Yoda
laughs
knocking on window
bell ringing
sighs
whispers
bell ringing
sighs
sighs
distant, echoing
deep, resonant voice
laughter
grunts
laughs
school bell ringing
applause and cheering
laughing
laughs
gasps
indistinct conversations
applause, cheering and whooping
applause, cheering
both laughing
knocking on door
laughs gently
Marley laughs
chuckles
all gasping, cheering
cheering
cheering, whooping
