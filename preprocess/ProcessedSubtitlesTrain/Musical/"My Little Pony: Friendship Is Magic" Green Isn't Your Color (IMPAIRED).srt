theme song begins
My Little Pony
My Little Pony
My Little Pony
softly, meekly
jazzy music playing
Fluttershy squeaks
ponies chattering
to self
crowd cheering and stomping approval
ponies clamoring for Fluttershy
Rarity gasps
ponies chattering
fans clamor for Fluttershy
Fluttershy yelps
paparazzi clamor for Fluttershy while taking pictures
sewing machine humming, door opens
fans clamoring for Fluttershy
strained
wistfully
morosely
door slams open
false sincerity
Fluttershy squeaks
pouts
door opens
perks up
irked
cheerily
derisively
Rarity growls under breath
meekly
camera shutters click
ponies chattering
hyperbolic gasp
whining
snide inflection
sarcastically
maliciously
taken aback
pleading
Twilight shrieks
inhales sharply, squeaks very softly
sighs
pokes eye
weary sigh
ominously
hastily
Twilight gasps
Pinkie Pie chomps apple slowly and deliberately
swallows, cheerily
Twilight sighs heavily
moans
resigned
epiphany
ponies gasping
cacophony of pony chatter
claps hooves
begging
confused
rapidly
sarcastically
ponies chattering, bass-heavy fashion show music playing
ponies chattering
Fluttershy grunts
music abruptly stops, ponies gasp
bizarre noises, Fluttershy shrieks repeatedly
ponies gasp, Photo Finish faints
ponies gasp
Fluttershy yelps
ponies gasp
ponies chatter
Fluttershy barks like a dog
ponies gasp and gag
Fluttershy brays like a donkey
ponies gasp
ponies chattering
applauding
Rarity applauding
crowd joins in applause and cheering
Fluttershy moans
vase wobbles lightly
plugs own mouth
strained
plugs mouth, mumbles incoherently
voice breaking
plugs mouth with fruit
grunts
both giggle
brohoof
Rarity and Fluttershy giggle
sighs
indignantly
dreamily
Twilight sighs
ending theme begins
