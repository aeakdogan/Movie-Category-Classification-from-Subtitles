 Join the party 
 Have a hearty glass of rum 
 Don't ever think about tomorrow 
 For tomorrow may never come 
 When I find me a happy place 
 That's where I wanna stay 
 I may never go home any more 
 After all that's what sailors are for 
 I've got kisses and kisses galore 
 That have never been tasted before 
 I may never go home 
 I may never go home 
 I may never go home 
 I may never go home 
 I may never go home any more 
 I may never go home any more
