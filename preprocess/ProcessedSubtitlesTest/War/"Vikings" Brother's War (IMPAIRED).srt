Bird cries
Harsh wind blows
Wind whistles
Expresses water forcefully from nose
Horn bellows in the distance
Horse snorts nervously
Inhales forcefully
Horse gallops, panting hard
Horn bellows
Horse nickers and snorts
Exhales
Exhales slowly
Wind howls
Inhales and exhales forcefully
Roar fiercely
Roar fiercely
Forceful breaths
Yells battle command
Scream fiercely
Ground rumbles
Spears clack, shields smash
Bodies crash, axes clank
Grunts of effort
Fierce grunt
Axes whip through air
Shields clank and thud forcefully
Fighting grunts, punching thuds
Blades and shields clash
Forceful grunt
Blade rings on impact
Fighting grunts, weapons smash
Hard smash
Struggling grunts
Straining grunts
Hard blows
Distorted breathing
Grunts
Hard whack
Groans
Fighting grunts
Gasping for air
Charging cry
Sickening crunch
Hard blow
Weapon slices
Heavy distorted breath
Weapons clank and slice
Warriors grunt and yell
Hard blows, fighting grunts
Pained grunt
Charging cry
Grunting with effort
Charging cry
Screams in pain
Growls, straining
Grunts in pain, gasps for breath
Grunting and choking in pain
Screaming and yelling fades out
Ear-ringing silence
Men yell and scream
Weapons clank and slice
Readying breaths
Threatening grunt
Breathing hard
Threatening grunts
Men scream
Weapons clash all around
Spear clatters
Weapons clash
Warriors grunt and scream
Sighs deeply
Breathing hard
Footsteps crunch, weapons clank
Groans weakly
Wind blows
Weary, frustrated sigh
Shouts
Quietly
Warriors talk quietly
Spits in disgust, groans
Water churns
Shouts of surprise in the distance
Cries of excitement
Chain clanks
Torstein grunts with effort
Women weep openly
Shout angrily
Bites food
Quietly
Grunts angrily
Plate strikes floor
Warningly
Chairs crash
Water splashes and drips
Doors crash open
Object smashes
Object clatters
Struggling grunts
Panting
Sharp gasp
Passionate gasp
Laughs
Townspeople chatter, seagulls cry
Approaching footsteps
Whispers
Angry shouting and jeering
Bangs staff
Angry jeers
Shouts of disagreement
Shouts angrily
Ships creak, dog barks, seagulls cry
Goats bleat, geese honk
Sighs heavily
Ships creaks, seagulls cry
Door creaks open
Birds chirp and cry, fire crackles
Waves lap gently
Waves lap against the ship
Ship creaks
Low hum of chatter, wind howls
Running footsteps
Buzz of excited chatter
Buzz of excited chatter
Sheep bleats
Low hum of chatter
Excited whispers
Boisterous chatter
Music fill the hall
Goat bleats
Uneasy silence
Sighs heavily
Women chatter nearby
Water splashes
Geese honk, people chatter
Laboured breath
Exhales in pain
Wind blows fiercely
Loud chatter fills the hall
Fire crackles
Doors bang open
Doors latches
Loud chatter resumes
Everybody quiets down
Hushed whispers and laughter
People laugh and chatter
Sighs heavily
Townspeople chatter
Emotional
Tearful, shaky breaths
Light kiss
Shaky, emotional breaths
Quiet whimper
Shaky, emotional breaths
Cart rattles, tack jingles lightly
Weeping
Hooves thud
Horse whinnies
Hooves thud
Water splashes
Galloping hard
Cart rattles to a stop
Running footsteps
Panting
Panting
Emotional exhale
Shaky, emotional breath
Shakily
Emotional exhale
Sniffs
Cart rattles away
Emotional exhale
Bleating
Horse neighs softly, goats bleat
Footsteps crunch in the dirt
Retreating footsteps
