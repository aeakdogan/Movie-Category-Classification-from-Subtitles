Indistinct shouting
Indistinct shouting in distance
Indistinct shouting
Engine turns over
Indistinct shouting
Quincy groaning
Exhales sharply
Tires screech
Door opens
Rats squeaking
Motors whirring
Air rushing
Glass shatters
Chuckles
Quincy breathing shakily
Quincy groans
Backup signal beeping
Machinery slows, stops
Indistinct shouting
Sighs
Indistinct talking
Grunts
Indistinct shouting
Machinery slowing
Machinery stops
Coughs
Sighs
Voice breaking
Crying
Gasps
Crying
Scanner beeping
Weakly
Voice breaking
Classical violin playing
Indistinct conversations
Crying
Elevator bell dings
Elevator bell dings
Crying
Tires screech
Screaming
Muffled screaming
