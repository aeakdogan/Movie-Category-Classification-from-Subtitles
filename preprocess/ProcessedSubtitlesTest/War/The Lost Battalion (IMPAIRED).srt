Wake up America
Listen for reveille
Women and men fight for what they believe
DISTANT EXPLOSIONS
Won't you step up to join the war
He's marching the band for score
So you must do what you must do now
To help our boys red white and blue now
Our cry is we want you now
Sing our song, won't be long, hip hip hooray
