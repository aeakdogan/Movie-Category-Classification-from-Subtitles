Geese honk, sheep bleat
Baby coos
Mother shushes the baby
Baby fusses
Baby cries
Water churns as Ragnar rows
Waves lap ashore
Flames crackle
Flames crackle
Flames roar
Sheathes sword
Wind howls
Water splashes
Low hum of chatter
Knife slices
Logs clank
Foliage crunches underfoot
Bushes rustle
Bushes rustle
Low hum of chatter
Arrow whooshes
Horse snorts
Horse hooves thunder
Terrified screams
Terrified screams in the distance
Horses whinny
Terrified screams, panic in the distance
Terrified screams, weapons clank
Hooves thunder
Foliage crunches underfoot
Still silence
Screams in the distance
Frightened screaming and panic
Frightened screaming
Axe slices
Shrill scream
Repeated hard blows
Arrow whooshes
Repeated hard blows
Axe slices, gurgled sounds
Weapons clung
Attack yell
Axe slices
Attack grunts
Terrified screams
Axe slices, gurgled sounds
Terrified screams
Pained grunt
Terrified screams
Pained grunt
Door creaks open
Struggling grunts
Fence rattles
Woman screams in the distance
Hard blow
Whispering
Weapons clank
Pained grunts
Moans weakly
Winces in pain
Terrified screams in the distance
Water laps ashore
Water splashes
Effort grunt
Attack cry
Horse snorts
Flames roar
Flames crackle
Hooves thunder
Pained grunt
Hooves thunder
Horse whinnies
Pained, struggling grunts
Horses thundering past
Grunts in pain
Water splashes
Tired exhale
Water splashes
Foliage crunches underfoot
Grunts in pain
Grunting in pain
Exhales
Gasps
Big splash
Splash
Exasperated sigh
Water churns
Cloth rips
Door creaks open
Buzz of chatter fills the hall
Approaching footsteps
Fire crackles
Flesh sizzles
Angry sigh
Happy exhale
Wind gusts
Logs thump
Effort grunts
Bird caws
Foliage crunches underfoot
Pants
Door creaks open
Floki slurps
Laugh turns into a pained grunt
Giggles
Rain patters
Owl hoots
Flames crackle
Grunts
Quietly
Low buzz of chatter
Geese honk, chickens cluck
Celebratory laughter and music
Clapping their hands to the music
Door creaks open
Earl Bjarni laughs
Clapping their hands to the music
Laughing and cheering
Laughs
Clapping
Loud snoring
Everyone snickers
Silence
Fire crackles
Sighs
Bird chirps
Chicken clucks
Weak laugh
Passionate kissing and moaning
Door creaks open and shut
Footsteps crunch in the snow
Pig squeals
Hard blows
Flames crackle
Approaching footsteps
Sighs
Water splashes, startled gasp
Breathing heavily
Tugs on his chains
Chuckles
Unsheathes dagger
Frightened gasps
Flames crackle
Mockingly
The door bursts open
Fire crackles
Grunts
Rain patters outside
Grunts
