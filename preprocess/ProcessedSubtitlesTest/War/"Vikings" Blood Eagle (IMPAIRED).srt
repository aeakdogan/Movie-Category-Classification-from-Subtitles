Doors burst open, struggling grunts
Pained grunt
Wind howls fiercely
Chimes ring lightly
Fire crackles
Wind howls
Doors creak open
Fierce winds howl
Footsteps scuff
Fire crackles
Rat squeaks
Hard whack
Sighs heavily
Retreating footsteps
Doors creak shut
Fire crackles
Wagons rattle, hooves thud
Horses snort
Royal trumpets bellow
Hooves thud, carriage rattles
Gate creaks open
Hooves thud
Horses whinny
Royal trumpets bellow
Raven caws
Hammering
Waves lap gently
Tapping
Water splashes
Footsteps splash
Sobs
Kiss
Water laps gently
Choppy water undulates
Sharp inhale and heavy sigh
Sniffs angrily
Footsteps retreat, fire crackles
Women chant
Gasps in pain
Wind howls
Approaching footsteps
Whispering
Coins clink
Blows out candle
Door rattles open
Water churns and splashes
Shackles clank
Gulping greedily
Panting
Retreating footsteps
Rat squeaks
Shackles clank
Snake hisses
Blowing dust
Wind gusts, parchment rustles
Raven croaks
Snake hisses, Seer exhales
Wings beat
Fighting grunt, weapons clank
Men cheering
Speaking Old Norse
Men cheer, laugh, and applaud
Lively chatter fills the hall
Chatter and laughter
Chuckles
Kiss
Fire crackles
Chair scrapes, thuds on the floor
Retreating footsteps
Sighs, considering
Goblets clink
Chuckles
Slurps
Distrustful chuckles
Grunts with effort
Sword scrapes
Priests sing in Latin
Guests laugh and cheer
Water splashes
Giggle happily
Laughter
Cheers, laughter, and applause
Laughter
Floki giggles, everyone cheers
Laughter and cheers erupt
Rain patters heavily
Hooves thud
Throwing grunt, hard whack
Laughs drunkenly
Spits then grunts
Preparatory exhale
Loud thwack
Laugh drunkenly
Laugh
Scoffs
Laughs drunkenly
Laughs drunkenly
Doors shut
Wind howls fiercely
Clothes rustle
Door creaks open
Rats squeak
Door bangs shut
Passionate gasps and moans
Sharp inhale, exhales slowly
Choked gasp
Shackles clank
Bathwater churns
Bathwater sloshes
Door closes
Horses gallop, whinnying
Sighs
Clears throat
Horse snorts
Laughs
Rat squeaks, door opens
Shackles clank, hay rustles
Door creaks closed
Frightened gasp, shackles clank
Shackles clank
Frightened gasp
Eating greedily
Shackles clank
Awkward swallowing grunts
Swords clank, fighting grunts
Landing blows
Attack yell, swords clank
Laughs
Laugh
Swords clank, fighting grunts
Hissing
Door creaks open
Whispering
Footsteps scuff
Shackles clank
Grunts with effort
Laboured breaths
Ominous music
Fire roars
Bell tolls
Flames roar, chimes clang
Chimes clang
Chime clangs loudly
Chimes clang
Ominous whispers
Ominous whispers
Ominous whispers
Distorted wing beats
Horn bellows in the distance
Flames roar
Flames crackle
