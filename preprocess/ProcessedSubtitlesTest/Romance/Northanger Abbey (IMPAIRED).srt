Baby cries
Catherine reads
Sighs
Snores
Reads
Clash of steel
Laughs
Groans
Sniggers
Conversation dies
Murmuring
Laughs
Courtly dance
Laughs
Laughs
Music finishes
Clears throat
Horse neighs
Thunder rumbles
Gasps
Whispering
Men laugh
Drivers gee on horses
Courtly dance
Music finishes
Murmur of conversation
Laughs
Laughs
Sheepdogs bark
Patter of rain outside
Sighs
Whispers
Gasps
Thunder rumbles
Reads
Whispers
Applause
Knock on door
Laughs delightedly
Music starts
Snores
Thunder crashes
Town crier's bell
Both giggle
Doors creak and groan
General clears throat
Rumble ofthunder
Thunder crashes
Creaking
Thunderclap
Laughs
Laughter
Thunder rumbles
Door opens
Catherine sobs
Laughs
Women's laughter outside
Growls
Whispers
Dog barks
Man shouts in distance
Women cackle
Thunder crashes
