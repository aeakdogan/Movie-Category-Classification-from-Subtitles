Both grunting
Gasps
Western folk music
Groans
Sighs
Groans
Scoffs
Baby fussing
Indistinct shouting
Woman screams
Birds chirping
Men shouting wildly
Arrow whooshes, horse neighs
Shouting continues
Horse neighs
Clicks tongue
Shushing
Laughs
Train whistle blows in the distance
Chuckles
Sighs

Crying softly, sniffles

Door opens and closes
Footsteps approaching
