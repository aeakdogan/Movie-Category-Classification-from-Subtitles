Help!
Someone
help
me!
Is
someone
there?
Hey!
Oh,
shit,
I'm
probably
dead.
MAN:
You're
not
dead.
Who's
that?
There's
no
point
in
yelling,
I
already
tried
that.
Turn
on
the
lights!
I
would
if
I
could.
What
the
fuck
is
going
on?
Where
am
I?
-
I
don't
know
yet.
Shh.
Hang
on
a
second.

Holy
shit.

Aaaargh!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
No-one
can
hear
you.
What
the
fuck
is
this?
-
Calm
down.
Just
calm
down.
Are
you
hurt?
I
don't
know.
Yeah!
-
What's
your
name?
What's
your
name?
What's
going
on
here?
My
name
is
Lawrence
Gordon,
I'm
a
doctor.
Aaaargh!
Recognize
him?
No.
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
you
got
here?
No.
-
What's
the
last
thing
you
remember?
I
went
to
bed
in
my
shit-hole
apartment,
What
about
you,
huh?
There's...
There's
not
much
to
tell.
I
was
on
my
way
home
from
work,
and...
I
don't
remember
anything
else.
First
dead
body
I've
ever
seen.
They
look
different
in
real
life.
They
don't
move.
From
the
looks
of
these
chains,
someone
didn't
want
us
to
go
very
far,
either.
-
Can
you
see
any
scars?
Man,
they
kidnap
you
and
drug
you.
Before
you
know,
you're
in
a
bath
No-one
has
taken
your
kidneys.
How
can
you
tell
from
way
over
there?
You'd
either
be
in
terrible
agony,
Trust
me.
-
What
are
you,
a
surgeon?
So...
Are
you
gonna
tell
me
Adam.
Well,
Adam...
What
we
need
to
do...
is
start
thinking
about
why
we're
here.
Whoever
brought
us
here
But
they
didn't.
They
must
want
something
from
us.
The
question
is,
what?
-
That
clock.
-
It's
brand-new.
So...somebody
obviously
Wait,
I
think
I
might
be
able
to
reach
the
door.

What
is
that?
Excuse
me.
It's
a
tape.
-
Where
did
you
find
it?
It
says,
"Play
me."
Come
on.
Come
on.
Throw
it
over
here.
Fuck.
No?


-
Use
your
shirt.
Your
shirt.

Come
on.
-
It
won't
work.
There
must
be
something
else
you
can
use.
-
There's
nothing.
Come
on.
You
can
do
it.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Again.
SINISTER
VOICE:
Rise
and
shine,
Adam.
You're
probably
wondering
where
you
are.
I'll
tell
you
where
you
might
be.
You
might
be
in
the
room
that
you
die
in.
Up
until
now,
you've
simply
sat
in
the
shadows,
But
what
do
voyeurs
see
Now,
I
see
you
as
a
strange
mix
But
mostly
just
pathetic.
So,
are
you
going
to
watch
or
do
something
about
it?
I
don't
get
it.
Throw
me
the
player.
No.
You
throw
me
your
tape.
Look,
we're
gonna
have
to
work
together,
-
Throw
it
to
me.
You
throw
me
your
tape.

SINISTER
VOICE:
Dr.
Gordon...
this
is
your
wake-up
call.
Every
day
of
your
working
life,
that
they're
gonna
die
soon.
Now
you
will
be
the
cause
of
death.
Your
aim
in
this
game
is
to
kill
Adam.
You
have
until
6
on
the
clock
to
do
it.
There's
a
man
in
the
room
with
you.
When
there's
that
much
poison
in
your
blood,
the
only
thing
left
to
do
is
shoot
yourself.

There
are
ways
to
win
this,
Just
remember,
If
you
do
not
kill
Adam
by
six,
then
Alison
and
Diana
will
die,
Dr.
Gordon.
And
I'll
leave
you
in
this
room
to
rot.
Let
the
game
begin.

Give
me
that.
Now.

Then
Alison
and
Diana
will
die,
Dr.
Gordon...
...and
I'll
leave
you
in
this
room
to
rot.
-
Any
idea
who
that
is?
-
He
knows
us.
What
do
you
think?
Probably
a
joke,
right?
Shh!
-
Let
the
game
begin.

Follow
your
heart.


What
the
hell
does
"follow
your
heart"
mean?
There,
right
next
to
you,
on
the
toilet.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Oh,
man!



-
Anything?
Take
off
the
lid.
Come
on.
I
really
wish
I
had've
checked
in
there
first.
Huh!
What
is
it?
Hey.
Mind
passing
me
the
other
one?
Fuck!
Fuck!

He
doesn't
want
us
to
cut
through
our
chains.
He
wants
us
to
cut
through
our
feet.
I
think
I
may
know
who's
done
this
to
us.
What
did
you
say?
Well,
it's
not
someone
I
know
personally.
It's
just
someone
I
know
of.
Jesus
Christ!
Tell
me.
Who
is
it?
Last
I
heard...
..the
police
still
hadn't
caught
him.
And
the
only
reason
I
know
that...
is
because
I
was
a
suspect.
I'll
start
from
the
beginning.

This
one's
not
fresh
any
more.
Victim's
a
46-year-old
male.
Died
of
massive
blood
loss,
He
started
at
the
back
and
tunneled
it's
amazing
he
got
as
far
as
he
did.
Cut
himself
so
deep,
We
also
found
this.

SINISTER
VOICE:
Hello,
Paul.
You
are
a
yet
last
month,
you
ran
a
straight
razor
across
your
wrists.
Did
you
cut
yourself
or
did
you
just
want
some
attention?
Tonight,
you'll
show
me.
The
irony
is
that
if
you
want
to
die,
you
just
have
to
stay
where
you
are.
If
you
want
to
live,
Find
a
path
through
the
razor
wire
to
the
door.
But
hurry.
At
three
o'clock
that
door
will
lock.
And
then
this
room
becomes
your
tomb.
How
much
blood
will
you
shed

Door
was
on
a
timer.
Then
it
slammed
shut.
He
was
given
two
hours.

You
sick
fuck!
A
jigsaw
piece.

I
think
we're
gonna
be
here
for
a
while,
Sing.
LAWRENCE:
The
newspapers
started
Actually,
technically
speaking,
he's...not
really
a
murderer.
He
never
killed
anyone.
He
finds
ways
for
his
victims
SINISTER
VOICE
ON
TAPE:
then
why
do
I
have
so
many
photos
of
you
Let's
put
your
so-called
illness
to
the
test.
Right
now,
there's
a
slow-acting
The
antidote
is
inside
the
safe.
Help!
The
combination
to
the
safe...
Hurry
up
and
program
it
in.
But
watch
your
step.
By
the
way,
that's
a
flammable
substance
So,
I
would
be
careful
Or
all
the
people
you've
burned
with
your
act
Aaaargh!
I
found
something
else.
Well,
two
things,
actually.
There
was
someone
standing
outside,
Our
friend
Jigsaw
likes
to
book
himself
He
was
there
at
the
last
one
as
well.
Only,
this
time...he
left
us
his
penlight.
Hm...
Get
a
rush
on
the
prints.
Copy
that.
This
patient
has
an
inoperable
frontal
lobe
It
started
as
colon
cancer.
The
patient
has
come
in
for
a
standard
checkup,
by
which
we
can
monitor
the
rate
-
The
patient
had...
Dr.
Gordon.
He's
a
very
interesting
person.
Thank
you
for
that
information,
Zep.
As
you
can
see,
our
orderlies
Continuing
on,
the
patient
had...
TANNOY:
Dr.
Gordon,
please
page
the
operator.
Someone
doesn't
want
me
to
tell
you
Dr.
Gordon.
I'm
Detective
Tapp,
this
is
Detective
Sing.
-
Very
impressive.
I
do
my
best.
-
Sorry
to
interrupt
you
while
you
work.
Now,
how
can
I
help
you
gentlemen?
Are
you
able
to
tell
us
where
you
were
Why
is
it
that
you're
interested?
We'd
like
to
ask
a
few
questions
about
it.
For
your
sake,
I
think
it's
best
-
Would
you
like
to
follow
us
there?
I
can't
just
leave,
I
have
work
to
do.
That's
OK.
You
can
ride
with
us.
Doc?

I'm
sorry.
You'll
have
to
tell
me
again.
Is
this
yours,
Doctor?
So
you
have
no
idea
how
your
penlight
Of
course
not,
Brett.
Well,
I
have
to
ask.
I
was
seeing
someone.
Who?
Look,
if
you
can't
be
honest
with
me...
I
was
visiting
someone,
It
wasn't
a
patient.
All
right?
What
am
I
gonna
do?
Well,
as
your
lawyer
and
your
friend,
my
advice
to
you
is
to
bite
the
bullet
cos
no-one's
gonna
believe
you
later.

That
was
five
months
ago.
He
tried
to
set
me
up
for
murder.
OK.
We
checked
your
alibi,
It
holds
up.
Good.
Can
I
go
home
now?
We
have
one
of
the
victims
Want
to
know
if
you
wouldn't
mind
sticking
Maybe
it'll
trigger
something.
-
I'd
like
to
help,
really,
but...
-
She's
the
only
one
who
made
it.
Amanda...
In
your
own
time...
tell
me
the
first
thing
you
remember.
AMANDA:
I
woke
up.
All
I
could
taste
was
blood.

And
metal.



SINISTER
VOICE:
Hello,
Amanda.
You
don't
know
me,
but
I
know
you.
I
want
to
play
a
game.
Here's
what
happens
if
you
lose.
The
device
you're
wearing
When
the
timer
on
the
back
goes
off,
your
mouth
will
be
permanently
ripped
open.
Think
of
it
like
a
reverse
bear
trap.
Here,
I'll
show
you.


There's
only
one
key
to
open
the
device.
It's
in
the
stomach
of
your
dead
cellmate.
Look
around,
Amanda.
Know
that
I'm
not
lying.
You'd
better
hurry
up.
Live
or
die.
Make
your
choice.



No!

And
then
I
saw
the
body.


There
was
a
knife.





He'd
been
injected
with
an
opiate
overdose.
Couldn't
move
or
feel
much
of
anything.
You
mean...he
was
alive?
Was.
What
happened
after
you
took
it
off?



SINISTER
VOICE:
Most
people
are
so
ungrateful
to
be
alive.
But
not
you.
Not
any
more.
You
are,
in
fact,
a
drug
addict.
Do
you
think
that
is
why
he
picked
you?

Are
you
grateful,
Mandy?
He...helped
me.


Are
you
sure
it's
him?
-
Yeah,
I'm
sure.
You
could
be
the
one
who
put
me
in
this
room!
I'm
in
exactly
the
same
situation
you're
in.
Wrong.
Wrong!
You've
got
one
thing
I
don't.
Information.
You
know
who
did
this.
Now,
you
either
tell
me
what
is
really
going
on,
I'll
cu...
-
What?
MAN:
I
can
see
you.
So,
that's
what
this
is.
Reality
TV.
MAN:
Don't
look
at
me,
I
can't
help
you.
Can
you
hear
me
in
there?
Huh?
This
is
the
most
fun
I've
had
without
lubricant.
Make
sure
you're
getting
everything.
That's
not
gonna
do
anything.
-
You
want
to
leave
it
running
on
us?
That's
why
we
can't
cut
through
these
chains
Every
possible
angle
You
make
it
sound
like
you
admire
this
prick.
To
overcome
something,
you
have
to
That's
how
you
fight
disease.
The
tape
told
us
to
find
an
X.
That
X
has
to
be
somewhere
in
this
room.
How
can
you
be
the
calm
doctor
when
He
has
them
too.
-
Are
you
thinking
about
that?
I've
been
thinking
about

Diana,
honey,
are
you
OK?
Diana,
honey,
can
you
hear
me?
-
Mommy...
There's
a
man
in
my
room.
Oh,
honey,
are
you
sure
he's
not
He
talked
to
me.
OK,
I'll
come
and
check
your
room.
I
want
Daddy.
He'll
get
the
scary
man.
All
right,
if
you
want.
Come
on.
Larry,
sorry
to
bother
you,
Just
a
minute.
She
wants
you
to
check
her
room.
Mm-hm.
Just
got
to
finish
this
paragraph.
Come
on,
sweetie,
I'll
check
with
you.
Nope,
I'm
done.
See?
There's
no-one
in
your
room.
There's
no
such
thing
as
the
Bad
Man.
-
Now
can
you
go
to
sleep?
You
are?
Give
me
your
tootsie.
Oh,
what
a
big
tootsie.
Remember
this
one?
This
little
piggy
went
to
market.
This
little
piggy
stayed
home.
This
little
piggy
had
roast
beef.
This
little
piggy
had
none.
This
little
piggy
ran...
Whee!
All
the
way
home!

I
hate
that
thing.
Well,
I
have
to
go
to
work,
sweetheart.
You
know
what
Daddy's
job
is
like.
Let's
see.
Try
and
get
some
sleep,
now,
OK?
You're
not
gonna
leave
us,
are
you,
Daddy?
What?
What
are
you
talking
about?
You
mean,
leave
you
and
Mommy?
No.
No,
sweetheart,
I...
I
would
never
do
that.
-
Who
gave
you
that
idea?
Well,
it's
not
true.
OK?
-
OK.
-
Love
you
very
much.
-
Good
night,
sweetie.
Tomorrow...I'll
read
you
your
favorite
story.
OK.
ALISON:
I
don't
know
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
I
am
happy.
ALISON:
At
least
there
would
be
some
passion
in
it.

Would
you
like
to
see
her?
-
She's
beautiful.
You
gonna
have
any
more
kids?
Ah,
we've...talked
about
it,
but
er...
..with
our
schedules,
it's
difficult
enough
to
concentrate
on
one.
So,
where's
the
lucky
wife?
There's
another
picture
It's
my
favorite
one
because...
Someone,
usually
me,
has
to
hold
the
camera,
which
means
I'm
always
missing
It's
er...
It's
not
here.
What?
This
photo
you're
talking
about's
not
here.
Really?
Are
you
sure?
Yeah.
Just...
Why,
he...
he
must
have
taken
it,
I...
ALISON:
How
can
you
pretend
you're
happy?
-
I
am
happy.
I'd
rather
you
just
tell
me
you
hate
me.
At
least
there
would
be
some
passion
in
it.
We'll
talk
about
this
later.
OK?
Just
leave.



MAN:
Good
night,
little
girl.

Diana?
Diana?


Diana!

Mommy!
ALISON:
Shh.



Don't
you
dare!
Get
away
from
her!

Mommy!

Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!

Get
off
of
her!

I'll

On

17th,
a

went
off
It's
an
old

Think
we
have
enough

though?
Who
said
anything

Fuck

fuck?
Shit!

I

tranquillizers
next
time.
Don't

I've
given
your
life
a
purpose.
You're
a
test
subject
Freeze!
-
Hold

there!


MAN:
Now

a
choice.
-
Get

Sing,

thing,
I'm
taking
him
down.
Fine.
Move!

How

it
off?
MAN:
One
key

unlock
it.

It's
in
the
box.
Fuck!

Which
key?
Which
key?

Time's
running

Now,

What's
more
important
to
you,
Officer?
Get
down
on
your
knees,
asshole!
-
Tapp!
-
Yes,
I'm
sick,
Officer.
Sick
from
the
disease
eating
away
at
me
inside.
Sick
of
people
Sick
of
those
who
scoff
at
the
suffering
of
others.
I'm
sick
of
'em
all!
Tapp!


No!
No!
Tapp!
Tapp!
Shit!
You're
OK.
Let
me

I'll

OK?
I'll
be
back.
Freeze,
or
I'll
shoot!



I

you.
I
had
you
on
your
knees.
But
you're
running.
You're
running.
You're
running
scared
cos...
We're
gonna
close
this
case.
Gonna
close
it.
Right,
Sing?
Right?
We're
gonna
close
it,
Sing.
LAWRENCE:
"X"
marks
the
spot.
We
need
to
search
this
room
again.
What
are
you
doing
over
there?
Excuse
me.
Just
because
I'm
stuck
in
this
room
with
you
doesn't
mean
I
have
to
report
I
really
don't
see
the
point
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
I'm
on
a
leash.
That's
exactly
why
we
need
to
talk
and
think.
-
I
am
thinking!
about
what
you're
thinking!
Turn
off
the
lights.
What?
Turn
them
off
now,
please.
-
Why?
Jesus.
Behind
you.
LAWRENCE:
The
lights
in
here
hadn't
charged
it.
-
Open
it!
The
key...
the
one
from
my
envelope.
Where
the
fuck?
Here.
A
cellphone.
The
most
beautiful
invention
on
this
planet.
Make
that
second-most
beautiful
invention.
Give
me
that.
Are
you
joking?
You're
going
to
put
something
Yes,
I'm
willing
to
risk
it.
Give
me
that
sweet
cancer.
I
don't
care,
I
really
don't.
Give
me
one
of
those.
SINISTER
VOICE:
The
cigarettes
Smoking
is
only
poisonous
when
it
ends
You
don't
need
a
gun
to
kill
Adam.
May
I
please
have
a
cigarette?
I'm
trying
the
police.


This
was
meant
to
receive
calls,
not
make
them.
Wait
a
minute.
This
has
happened
before.
Last
night,
after
I
finished
at
the
hospital...
...I
was
walking
back
to
my
car.
I
thought
I
was
alone,
but...
...I'm
sure
someone
else
was
there.


Great.



That...thing...was
waiting
for
me.
How
did
you
know
to
turn
off
the
lights?
-
Who
cares?
It
worked.
Instinct.
Instinct?
-
Yeah.
You're
a
terrible
liar.
You
say
that
like
you
know
me.
What
else
aren't
you
telling
me?
Well,
um,
let's
see...
On
my
sixth
birthday,
my
best
friend
at
the
time,
stabbed
me
with
a
rusty
nail
-
My
last
girlfriend,
a
feminist
vegan
punk,
broke
up
with
me
because
I
was
too
angry.
-
One
of
my
toenails
is
slightly...
You
knew
to
turn
off
these
lights.
-
Whatever.
-
You
wanna
know?
Here
it
is.
Come.
Oh,
God.
W-Where
did
you
get
this?
It
was
in
your
wallet.
Behind
the
photo
of
your
daughter.
-
Why
didn't
you
show
me
this
before?
I'm
sorry.

What
are
you
doing
to
them,
you
bastard?
OK.
OK.
OK,
I've
got
to
think
now.
Think
about
this
-
you
don't
need
a
gun
to
kill
Adam.
When
there's
that
much
poison
in
your
blood,
the
only
thing
left
to
do
is
shoot
yourself.
What
are
you
doing?
Hey,
what
the
hell
are
you
doing?
LAWRENCE:
I
want
you
to
play
along
with
me
on
this.

LAWRENCE:
You
got
that?
So,
you
er...
You
still
want
that
cigarette?
Um...yeah.
Sure.


There!
I've
done
it!
I've
killed
him
with
the
poison
like
you
wanted!
Now
where's
my
family?
Where
are
they?

Aaaargh!
-
Aagh!
Jesus
Christ!

What?
Jesus.
That
was
our
way
out!
Did
you
hear
what
I
said?
Get
this
thing
off
me!
-
Get
it
off!
You
think
I
would
make
that
up
just
to
mess
up
All
right,
that's
it.

Damn
it!

I
remember
everything
now.
I
remember
how
I
got
here.




Oh...

Great.


Is
someone
there?


I
can
hear
you.



What
the...?
What
the
Christ...?


What
the...?
-

Who
is
that?
-
Who's
in
there?
Come
out!
I'll
kill
you,
you
motherfucker!

Aagh!



Who
is
this?
DIANA:
Daddy?
Diana.

Daddy,
is
that
you?
Yeah,
baby,
it's
me,
I'm
here.
I-I'm
scared,
Daddy.

Don't
worry,
honey.
Everything's
gonna
be
OK.
-
Where's
Mommy?
Let
me
talk
to
her,
sweetie.
OK?
Put
Mommy
on.
The
bad
man
from
my
room
is
here.
He
has
us
tied
up...
And
he
has
a
gun.
Wh-What
man?
Please
come
home,
Daddy.
Hello?
Hello?
Diana?
Diana?
Diana!
Larry.
Ali?
Is
that
you?
Is
Adam
there?
Well,
how
do
you
know...
Ali...
What
is
going
on?
Don't
believe
Adam's
lies.
He
knows
you.


Hello?
Ali?
Ali?
Hello!
Goddamn
you!
If
you
so
much
as
lay
a
finger
on
them,
You
hear
me,
you
son
of
a
bitch?
I'll
kill
you!

Damn!
Are
they
OK?
My
wife,
she
er...
She
mentioned
your
name.
What
did
she
say?
She
told
me...
not
to
believe
you.
Believe
me
about
what?
She
told
me
you
knew
me.
Who
are
you?
You
know
who
I
am.
Stop
the
lies!
You're
a
liar!
I'm
a
liar?
What
did
you
do
last
night,
Lawrence?
Work
at
a
hospital,
saving
sick
children?
You
told
me
you
went
to
work
at
a
hospital.
-
That's
because
it's
the
truth.
Your
wife
is
right,
Larry.
You
don't
recall
getting
your
picture
taken
I
can
prove
that
you
didn't
go
anywhere
near
It's
not
the
first
time
I've
done
it
either,
Larry.
I've
been
taking
pictures
of
you
for
days
now.
-
Why?
I
get
paid
to
take
pictures
of
rich
guys
like
you,
who
go
to
seedy
motels
to
fuck
their
secretaries.
Last
night,
I
went
to
your
house.
and
watched
you
leave.
I
followed
you...
...all
the
way
to
that
shit-bag
hotel.
You've
er...had
these
with
you
the
whole
time?
I
found
them
in
there
with
the
hacksaws.
I
don't
know
how
they
got
there.
-
Right!
You're
so
full
of
it!
But
my
camera
isn't.
It
doesn't
know
how
to
lie.
It
only
shows
you
what's
put
right
in
front
of
it.
Just
out
of
curiosity,
You
got
out
of
there
pretty
fast.
Why
did
you
um...
deem
it
necessary
to
page
me
I
didn't
know
if
you
were
going
to
make
it.
I
gave
you
a
precise
time
at
which
to
page
me.
You
can't
do
that.
It's
not
like
I
know
the
rules
for
this
sort
of
stuff.
-
What's
wrong,
Dr.
Gordon?
It
was
wrong
of
me
to
make
you
come
here.
-
But
I
thought
we've...
I'm
sorry.

You
tell
anyone
you
were
here?
No.
Hello.
-
It's
for
you.
Hello.
MAN:
I
know
what
you're
doing...
Doctor.
-
I...

I
have
to
go.
-
What
happened?
-

Who
was
it?
Who
was
what?
The
person
who
paid
you
to
follow
me.
He
calls
himself
Bob
and
he
gives
me
If
I'd
known
I'd
end
up
here,
What
does
that
mean?
What
I
saw
was
you
get
into
your
car.
That's
it.
I
didn't
ask
your
name.
I
don't
know
how
I
got
here.
I
took
the
shots
and
went
straight
home
Next
thing
I
know,
I'm
chained
to
a
pipe
in
some
prehistoric
bathroom,
staring
at
Clearly,
whoever
paid
you
to
take
pictures
of
me
Maybe.
Of
course
it
is!
What
did
he
look
like?
-
Just
a
guy.
-
I
don't
take
notes.
-
I
can't.
-
I
told
you,
I...
He's
a
tall
black
guy.
Tapp.
-
Detective
Tapp.
The
guy
who
paid
me
to
take
these
photos
No,
no.
He
was
discharged
from
the
police
force.
He
broke
down
after
his
partner
was
killed.
But
that
didn't
stop
him
harassing
me.
He's
convinced
I
must
have
somehow
He's
crazy.
And
you
helped
him.
You
took
money
from
him
to
invade
my
privacy.
How
could
you
do
that?
-
Call
it
my
need
to
eat.
Right.
You
know
what,
Adam,
-
You're
part
of
it.
This
cop
thinks
you're
the
one
behind
it
all.
I
told
you,
he's
not
a
cop.
What
are
you
pissed
off
about?
or
the
fact
that
I
took
shots
of
you
-
I
did
not
cheat
on
her!
I
don't
give
a
crap
if
you
covered
yourself
in
How
did
I
get
here?
I
had...
I
had
everything
in
order.
My
whole
life
was
in
perfect
order.



Sweetheart,
are
you
OK?
Mommy
just
needs
you
to
be
I'm
not
gonna
let
anybody
hurt
you.
You
got
that?
OK.
That's
my
good
girl.
ADAM:
Hey,
was
there
someone
else
besides
your
wife
and
daughter?
-
No.
I
know
him.
-
Zep.
His
name
is
Zep.
He's
an
orderly
at
my
hospital.
Zep.
You
perverted
little
psychopath.
I'm
gonna
take
great
pleasure
you
bastard
fuck!
Look.
We're
out
of
time.
-

-
Mommy,
help
me!
Dr.
Gordon's
time
is
up.
Now
I've
got
to
do
what
I've
got
to
do,
and...
..I'm
afraid
it
has
to
be
you



Is
that
you,
Zep,
you
bastard?
I
know
it's
you,
you
son
of
a
bitch!
ALISON:
La...
Larry.
Ali?
You
failed.
Hello?
Hello?
-
You!

Don't
move!
Stay
on
the
ground.
Give
me...
Give
me
the
phone.
Give
it
to
me!
Larry?
Ali!
Honey,
are
you
all
right?
No...
No,
we're
not.
Get
down!
-
Larry,
where
are
you?
I'm
being
held
captive
in
a
room
somewhere.

-
I'm
so
sorry,
Ali.
So
sorry
for
everything.
It's
my
fault.
Forgive
me,
I've
always
been
happy
with
you.
Mommy!
-
Aagh!
Jesus!
Ali!

Mommy!
Ali!
Ali!
Mommy!
Aargh!
Aaargh!
Freeze!


Oh,
no!

-
Yaaaa!

Argh!
Urgh!

Mrs.
Gordon?

I'm
gonna
kill
your
husband
now,
Mrs.
Gordon.



Lawrence!

Lawrence,
get
up!
Lawrence!
Get
up!
I
need
you!
Oh,
thank
God,
I
thought
you
were
dead.

He...He...
He
electrocuted
me.
I
told
you.
I
wasn't
lying.
See?
Fuck
this
shit!
-


No!
Lawrence,
calm
down.
-
There
must
be
a
way
out
of
this.
Just
shut
up!
My
family
needs
me!
No!
God!
God!
No!
Argh!

Lawrence!
I
have
a
family
too.
I
don't
see
them,
that's
my
mistake.
I'm
gonna
kill
you,
you
sick
asshole.

Lawrence!
Stop
it.

Lawrence,
just
calm
down.
There's
a
way
out
of
here.
Lawrence!
No!
What
are
you...
No!
Oh,
my
God!
Lawrence!
What
are
you
doing?

What...are
you
doing?
What
are
you...
What
are
you...
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
Lawrence,
don't!
No!
No,
Lawrence,
please!
I'm
begging
you!
Lawrence!
It's
not
me
who
did
this
to
you!
-
You
have
to
die.
-
I'm
sorry.
-
My
family...

There!
I've
done
it!
Now
show
them
to
me!
Show
them
to
me.
-
Thank
you
very
much,
Officer.
Did
you
get
through
to
him?
-
There's
still
no
answer.
Everything
is
OK.

You
bastard!
I'll
fucking
kill
you!
I'll
fucking
kill
you!
You
fucking
bastard!
I'll
fucking
kill
you!
-
I'll
fucking
kill
you!
I'll
fucking
kill
you.
You're
too
late.
-
Why?
Argh!


You're
gonna
be
all
right.
You're
just
wounded...
wounded
in
the
shoulder.
I
have
to
go
and
get
help.
Don't
leave
me!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Ow!
D-Don't
worry.
I'll
bring
someone
back.
I
promise.
