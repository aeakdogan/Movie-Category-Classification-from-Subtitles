a
funny
way
you
find
anything
there's
a
meg
masters
i
even
pulled
up
now,
look,
why
don't
you
and
invite
her
or
whatever
it
is
what
about
the
symbol?
yeah,
that
i
did
have
turns
out
very,
very
old-school,
it's
a
sigil
for
a
daeva.
what's
a
daeva?
it
translates
zoroastrian
demons,
nasty
attitudes
--
how
did
you
you
don't
have
a
corner
name
the
last
book
i
called
dad's
friend
caleb.
anyway,
these
daevas,
so
someone's
yeah,
and
from
what
i
gather,
these
suckers
tend
to
and
the
arms
what
do
they
look
like?
nobody's
seen
them
summoning
a
demon
someone
really
i
think
we've
got
why
don't
you
go
give
that
girl
bite
me.
don't
leave
teeth
marks,
sam?
are
you
--
no,
no,
i'm
just
--
pervert!
what
a
creep!

don't
think
you

come
because
the
brothers
--
i
didn't
know
that
--
yes,
sir.
yes,
i'll
be
here...
what
the
hell?
dude,
i've
got
to
so,
hot
little
meg
it
looks
like
to
control
the
thing.
so
sammy's
got
a
thing
and
what's
the
deal
she
was
talking
the
way
witches
used
to
scry
she
was
communicating
with
the
daeva?

out
and
guess
holy
crap.

the
significance

we
can't.
we've
got
to
