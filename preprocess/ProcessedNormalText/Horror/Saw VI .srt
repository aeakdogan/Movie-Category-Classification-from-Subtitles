Hello,

You

what

is
the

Hello,

Well,
today,
you
will
experience

see
the
consequence
for
those
Fuck
you!
Someone's
there.
They're
watching
us.
Why?
Why
would
someone
do
this?
Thanks
for
coming.
What'd
you
find?
-
An
abnormality
with
Strahm's
fingerprints
Take
a
look
See,
the
human
fingerprint
leaves
an
oily
residue
Depending
on
how
long
it's
been
it's
highly
susceptible
to
contamination.
So
what's
the
problem?
Well,
we
found
trace
amounts
of
Halomethane
R-12.
She
means
Freon
Production
of
R-12
ceased
in
1994,
so
the
question
is,
was
the
contaminant
we
found
at
the
sight
already,

controllamo
inside
the
'edifcio
Did
anything
come
off
of
the
Seth
Baxter
tape?
Uh,
yeah,
actually.
The
tape
was
in
pretty
rough
shape
when
The
voice
was
intentionally
distorted,
It's
currently
being
analyzed.
-Through
what?
to
find
the
original
voice.
He's
on
with
the
tech
now.
You
timing
something?
Oh,
I
was
before
I
got
your
call.
We
got
it.
The
lab's
off-site.
Come
on.
You're
coming,
right?
Of
course.
Hey!
Who's
in
there?
-
Sr.
Easton,
was
you?
Who's
in
there
with
you?

We
are
all
here,
sir,
all

What
to
see?

Nothing
at
all,
it's
dark.

is
that
sound?

-

Please

Help,

Sr.
Easton,
please.

Mr.

Hello,
William.
Before
you
are
six
of
your
most
valuable
associates.
The
ones
who
find
errors
on
policies.
Their
findings
result
in
over
two-thirds
of
all
applications
denied
or
prematurely
terminated.
Now
you
must
apply
your
"analysis"
to
them
and
be
able
to
find
their
errors.
Six
ride
the
carousel,

but
only
two
can
get
off.

The
decision
of
which
two
will
survive
falls
upon
you,
And
if
no
decision
is
made
on
your
part,
To
offer
the
two
reprieves,
you
must
press

both
buttons
at
once
in
the
box
before
you.
However,
in
doing
so,
Two
can
live.
Four
will
die.
Your
decision
is
symbolized
Wake
up!
Listen
to
me!
Fuck!
Jesus!
Please!
Mr.
Easton!
Please!
Follow
policy,
Mr.
Easton!
Do
it!
Please!
Follow
the
policy,
Mr.
Easton!
Mr.
E!
You
always
said
we're
only
-I'm
the
strongest!
You
can't
let
me
die!
I'm
healthy!
I'm
healthy!
I
have
two
kids!
You
know
them,
Will!
Please,
they
can't
get
on
without
me!
-Thanks....thank
you...
I
do
not
even
know
Mr.
Easton.
My
parents
are
sick!
They
need
me!
I'm
all
they
have!
-You
fucking
liar!
Your
parents
hate
you!
They
cut
you
off!
I'm
pregnant!
I'm
pregnant!
No
she's
not!
She's
lying!
-She's
fucking
lying!
Mr.
Easton,
she's
lying!
Please!
Please!
Push
the
thing!
Seriously!
-I'm
pregnant!
No!
,
no!
,
no!
Oh,
please!
Forget
that!
Mr.
Easton!
My
parents
are
loaded!
But
if
you
do
not
see
them
for
years!
Dave!
Christ!
Mr.
Easton,
come
on!
Mr.
Easton,
please.
Okay,
listen
to
me,
Mr.
Easton!
Mr.
Easton!
I'm
on
your
side
and
I
can
help
you.
-You
cannot
trust
this
bitch!
She
is
all
lies!
You
cannot
believe
her!
She
has
-You
know
it!
Trust
me!
It's
me,
Josh.
Help
me!
Fuck!
-Oh,
well
that's
it,
isn't
it?!
It's
over!
-You
motherfucker!
You
spineless,
pussy-whipped
MOTHERFUCKER!
That's
all
it
takes,
huh?!
Bitch
says
one
thing
and
its
all
over!
You
know
what,
William?!
Your
policy
is
BULLSHIT!
Fucking
bullshit!
Will
you
listen
to
me,
you
son
of
a
bitch?!
Look
at
me!
When
you're
killing
me,
you
look
at
me!
Oh
My
god...
Right
now,
you're
feeling
helpless.
This
is
the
same
helplessness
Right
now,
you're
feeling
helpless.
How's
it
going?
Good.
This
is
it.
Whoever
made
this
tape
had
access
to
some
very
impressive
audio
filtration
equipment.
Right
now,
you're
feeling
helpless.
Fortunately,
we
have
some
tricks
of
our
own,
here.
I
can
turn
his
algorithm
upside-down
and
let
us
Let's
hear
what
you
got.
Right
now,
you're
feeling
helpless.
-You
okay?
You
seem
a
little...
preoccupied.
I'm
just
anxious
about
the
tape.
You
know,
there
are
still
a
couple
of
things
Like,
I
don't
understand
Strahm's
motivation.
He
was
my
partner
for
5
years.
I
mean,
but
I
never
saw
any
indication
of
psychotic
behavior.
You
can't
really
tell
when
...helpless.

Hear
that?
I'm
getting
there.
Come
on.
I
thought
you
had
something
to
show
us.
It's
just
I
never
really
You
know.
I
mean,
Something
doesn't
sit
right.
Listen.
It's
getting
closer.
You
know,
there
is
an
alternative.
Let's
say
that,
Strahm
killed
Seth
Baxter
specifically
to
set
you
up
as
an
accomplice
to
Jigsaw.
...Okay.
Well,
there's
a
problem
with
that,
though.
On
further
analysis
of
Strahm's
fingerprints,
it
was
found
that
the
uric
acid
levels
were
inconsistent
for
an
individual
with
In
other
words?
In
other
words,
when
you
left
Strahm
was
already
dead
by
then!
There
it
is.
Right
now,
you
are
feeling
helpless.
Who
else
knows
about
me?
Who
knows
about
me?
Everyone!
You
lie.
You're
a
fucking
liar...
Because
I
found
something
you'll
want
to
see
It
was
at
the
location
where
John
died.
Does
it
mean
anything
to
you?

What
are
you
doing?
I'm
trying
to
finish
this
We
do
not
know
what
will
happen.
Do
not
just
sit
here
doing
nothing.
We
must
make
a
decision,
Ok.
You
can
pull
it.
I
love
you.
I
love
you,too.
Departed.
No.
I
do
not
know
what
will
happen.
At
the
three
draft.
No.
No.
One
...
Two
...
Three!
What
the
fuck?
This
thing
not
working!
This
thing
does
not
work...
What
the
fuck?
I
think
I
know
what
it
is
used.
Get
used
to
me,
'cause
I'm
not
going
anywhere.

You
sure
about
that?
Amanda
will
fail
you.
We'll
see
Amanda,
you
were
with
Cecil
I
can't
fucking
do...
I
don't
want
to
get--
What
do
you
mean
you
don't
want
to--
Run,
fucking
pussy!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Cecil?
What're
you
doing!
You
killed
their
child.

You
know
it,
and
I
know
it.
So
do
exactly
as
I
say:

kill
Lynn
Denlon,
or
I
will
tell
John
what
you
did.
She
doesn't
deserve
to
go
free!
Amanda,
Lynn
is
more
important
than
you
know.

-I
did
it.
I
made
it.I
made
it!
I've
done
it!!
-If
you
fail,
you
will
never
see
your
family
again.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
Pamela.
Yes
I
know
it's
your
birthday,
and
I'm
going
to
You're
really
standing
up
your
sister
for
work?
I'm
your
only
family.

Are
you
okay?
Let
her
go!
I
made
it!
I
won!

Shit,
I
followed
your
fucking
rules.
You
son
a
bitch.
You've
just
given
me
a
death
sentence,
You
just
killed
me.
You're
the
man
who
killed
my
dad.
Hello,
Tara.
My
apologies
for
exposing
you
but
I
can
assure
you
it
is
not
without
reason.

The
man
before
you
just
made
the
sacrifices
to
save
the
life
of
a
loved
one.
However,
when
given
the
opportunity
he
chose
not
to.

Now,
you
will
be
given
the
power

to
save
a
life.

Will
you
grant
this
man
or
will
you
dispense
the
same
death
Live
or
die.

The
choice
is
yours.

It's
not
my
game.
I'm
leaving
you
a
box,
today
and
its
contents
are
of
grave
importance
Ms.
Tuck,
what's
in
the
box?
Please.
Forgive
me.
Please!
Have
mercy,
please!
Did
he
show
mercy
When
my
husband
was
suffering?
John
left
you
5
envelopes.
The
sixth
one
was
for
me.
This
is
John's
will.
-
He
had
no
choice!
Please,
no.
The
only
reason
I'm
doing
this
is
not
because
I
can't
forgive
you
for
what
you
did
to
me.
The
reason
I'm
doing
this
is
because
I
couldn't
forgive
myself
for
what
you
might
do
to
someone
else.
Please,
no.
-
You'll
never
kill
again.
I
can't...
I
can.
No,
Brent!
You
killed
my
father,
you
motherfucker!
Now
you
burn
in
hell!
Those
are
the
rules,
Harold!

You've
just
given
me
a
death
sentence.
So,
in
a
sense...
you
choose
who
lives
or
dies?
It's
policy,
John.
It's
policy.
Who
devised
that
formula?
You
think
it's
the
living
that
will
have
ultimate
judgement
over
you,

because
the
dead
will
have
But
you
may
be
mistaken.
Game
over.
No!
No!
So
when's
your
test,
detective?

I
don't
need
one.

Oh,
yeah?

You
know
why
you're
here,
don't
you?
I
want
to
know
if
you
have
You
feel
you
now
have
control,
don't
you?

You
think
you
will
walk
away
untested?
I'm
only
carrying
out
John's
final
requests.
Do
you
like
how
brutality
feels,
Mark?

From
now
on,
That's
not
what
John
wanted.

You
want
a
chance?

I'll
give
you
a
chance.
