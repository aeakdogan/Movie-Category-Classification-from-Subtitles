copy.
So...
I
did
one
for
you.
You
brought
me
here
Well,

minutes.
OK?
It's
totally
underground

How

the
right
choice.
Aidan,
dinner's
ready.

Damn.
Aidan!
OK,
now,
before
you
say
anything,
Just
'cause
it
doesn't
look

honey.
He'd
be
proud
of
you.
Thanks,
Rachel.
You
know,
it
wouldn't
kill
you
"Ma.

"Mommy.

Something
besides
"Rachel".
Yeah,
I
like
"Rachel".
Well,
"mom"
has
its
charms
too,
But
"Rachel"
Really?
Well,
Rachel

All
of
this
space
and

anyone
would
do.
We

the
whole
thing.
The

Huh?
Look

OK?
What
is
it?
That's
all
right.
Oh,
God,
you're
soaked.
Let's
get
you
out
of
Aidan?
What
happened
in
your
nightmare?
I
woke
up
and
you
weren't
here.
I'm
here
now,
honey.
Listen.
All
you
have
to
do
is
call
my
OK?
Even
if
I
have
to
come
right
down
So
tell
me
what
happened.
Hmm?
I
don't
remember.
You
don't
remember?
I
don't
remember.

Aidan.

Aidan.
Aidan.
Honey.
You
heard
me?
I've
been
calling
your
name.
I'm...
sorry.

to
go?
OK.


So
we'll

by
And
you
can
keep
a
watch
on
Look
at
all
this
stuff.

Rachel.
Sorry.
What's
wrong,
honey?
Mm-hmm.
I'm
just
a
little
cold,
Rachel.
-
I'm
gonna
take
a
look
around.
Stay
close.


Would
you
like
a
marble,
ma'am?




Aidan?

Aidan?
Aidan.


Aidan?

You
gotta
wait
-

Here
I
go!
Aidan.






Aidan!

Are
you
in
there?
Aidan?
Why
didn't
you
answer
me,
honey?
Jesus.
Jesus,
you're
freezing,
honey.
Talk
to
me,
honey.
Talk
to
me.
What's
going
on?
-
What
is
it?
It's
OK.
It's
OK.
Honey,
when
did
this
start?
Was
it
last
night,
or
this
morning?
I
don't
remember.
I
know
you
don't
like
me
prying,
Was
it
your
nightmare?
I
really
don't
remember,
Rachel.
I
need
you
to
try.
You're
sick,
all
right?
And
we
Aidan.
Was
she
in
your
nightmare?
Rachel!




Don't
stop.
Don't
stop.
-
Go!
Drive!
Drive!
Just
don't
stop
the
car!


Get
down!
-

-



"Don't
stop.
"
You
said,
"Don't
stop.
"

Don't
stop.

OK.
Let's
see.
That's
impossible.
Rachel...
...what's
happening?

Yeah,
hi,
um...
My
son
is
very
sick
and
I'd
like
to
Well,
it's
his
temperature.
Yeah.
Well,
then,

Hello?
Hello?

Aidan?
Honey,
the
power
just
went
out.
Aidan?
Honey,
this
shouldn't
be
open.
God.

Aidan,
let's
go.
Get
out
of
bed.
Aidan,
what
are
you
Get
back
in
bed
right
now.
I
saw
something.
-

Aidan...
Move!
Get
away.
Honey,
let's
go.
Come
on.
-

I
saw
it.
-
I
saw
it
in
my
head.


Oh,
Miss
Keller...
-
About
my
story.
I...
Now,
listen,
sweetie.
It
was
one
of
hers.
And
I
made
it
so
we'd
never
But
if
she
knows
that,
what
I
did
might
Am
I
right?
Look,
if
you
know
why
she's
here,
Aidan...
...is
she
here
to
hurt
you?
Honey.

She
can
hear
us.
She
hears
everything.
Except
when
we
sleep.
She
can't
hear
us
What
does
that
mean?
We
have
to
sleep.


Rachel,
Yeah.
What
happened
to
your
car?
Your
car.
Apparently
it's
wrecked.
-
Are
you
guys
OK?

And
no
one's
hurt?
That's
good.
Aidan,
right?
Hi,
I'm
Max.
-
Is
he
all
right?
How
sick?
Max,
I
need
your
help.
Here.
I'll
get
some
more
blankets.
The
house
is
yours
if
there's

OK.
Thanks.
-
Here.
-
Shouldn't
he
be
at
a
hospital?
The
bath?
Just
down
the
hall.
Honey.
I'm
gonna
go
home
Then
we'll
leave
here

Let's
get
you
warmed
up.
Not
the
best
water
pressure,
It's
good,
thanks.
The
block
seemed
fine.
I
have
plenty
of
candles
Go
ahead
and
get
in.
Max,
I
just
need
get
a
few
things,
Do
you
mind
if
you
could?
-
I'll
watch
him.
Of
course.
Honey,
go
ahead
and
get
in.
We
need
to
raise
your
temperature.
Aidan,
what's
wrong?
-
We
need
to
raise
your
temperature...
Do
you
want
me
Let's
go
then.
That's
it.
Come
on,
honey.
That's
it.
That's
it.
That's
better,
right?
See?
It's
nice
and
warm.
It's
OK.
Just
relax.

any
headlines?
No?
Well,
business
is

I'm
good.
Could
you
do
me
a
little
favour
Could
you
look
into
and
see
if
there
was
an
accident
"K"
for
Keller.
No,
no,
I'm
just
trying

Ray?
Ray,
let
me
call
you
right
back.
OK.

Everything
OK
in
there?
Uh,

you
hear
me?
Aidan,

He's
in
the
bath.

at
me.

Mommy!


Rachel,
no!

Baby.
Oh.
Oh,
my
God.
It
wasn't
him.
It
wasn't
him.
I
was
just
trying
to
help.
OK,
Rachel,
let's
just
Why
is
she
doing
this
to
me?
I'm
here
now,
baby.
-
Why
is
she
doing
this
to
me?
-
We're
gonna
get
you
to
a
hospital.
-
They
can't
do
anything.
You
asked
for
help,
He
gets
to
a
hospital.
Now.


We're
working
to
raise
He
was
at
90
degrees
-
He
wasn't
outside
overnight?
A
body
doesn't
develop
Whatever
the
cause,
he's
fighting
it.
-
And
he's
just
sleeping
now?
And
having
some
kind
of
dream.
What's
the
story,
Rachel?
They
stabilized
his
temperature.
I
mean
the
story
You
seem
awfully
hard
on
him.
Look,
I
know
Moving.
It's
a
whole
new
life.
Maybe
you
should
tell
me.
All
I
ever
tried
to
do
for
him
and
it
only
ever
Then
it
wasn't

What
do
you
see?
Well,
it's
Aidan.
-
Is
that
a
girl
there?
-
Why?
How
would
I
know?
Her
name's
Samara.
She
was
murdered
by
her
mother.
-
Wait,
she's...
she's
who?
At
least,
not
her
ghost.
I
let
it
out,
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
but
she's
here
now.
And
I
thought
it
was
but
it's
more
than
that.
And
she
wants
to
live
You
tell
me,
who
can
help
me?
-
Who?
You
take
his
picture
-
Rachel.
It's
proof
that
he's
what?
No.
The
proof

Aidan,
you
said
Samara
Well,
you're
sleeping
now.
Tell
me
how
to
stop
her,
honey.
Tell
me
how
to
help
you.
Just
tell
me,

we
could
Right.
Um,
Dr
Koji

when
Aidan
was
born.
Postpartum

That
was
the
first
month.
I

It's
very
common.
I

to
do
with
Have
you
been
Have
you
ever
found
that
you
were...
...unable
to
experience
love
for
Aidan?
-
What?
however
unintentionally?
Have
you
left
him
alone?
I'd
like
to
be
with
my
son,
Yeah,
of
course.
I'm
sorry,
Rachel.

Until
we
can
talk
further,
I
cannot
let
you
be
alone
with
him.
I'm
his
mother.
There
are
bruises
on
his
body.
He
was
hypothermic
That
is
not
because
of
me.

He's
gonna

my
job
if
I
did.

Early
birds.
Marty
Savide,

get
around
the
gate?
Ah!
Who

everyone.
So

what
happened
I
believe
they

Really?


Her
mother.

I'll
take
it
from
here.
Hello,
Aidan,
I'm
Dr
Temple.
How
are
you
feeling?
Aidan?
You
know,
Can
you
tell
me
Where's
my
mommy?
Well,
she'll
be
here
soon.
I
want
Mommy.
Yeah,
I
know
you
do.
Your
mommy
So
where
is
she?
She
went
home.
She
didn't
think
that
you
I
wanna
go
home
too.
Well,
you
will.
We
just
have
to...
You're
freezing.
I
wanna
go
home
to
Mommy.
Well,
we
need
to
talk
about
her.
Can
you
tell
me
She
loves
me.
I
know
that
she
does.
She
went
looking
for
me.
It
means
she
loves
me.
I
don't
understand.
Can
I
go
home
now?
No,
honey,
Can
I
go
home?
No.
I'm
sorry.
Then
I
have
It
won't
stop.


I'm
gonna
walk
you
Her
name
was
Evelyn.
She
came
to
us
-
Did
she
have
her
baby
here?
And
you
arranged
That's
right.
-
And
the
father?
Half
the
mothers
So,
what
did
she
think
Evelyn
wasn't
well.
She
had
been
having
problems
Hallucinations,
visions.
She
believed
some
thing
from
the
waters
of
the
world
I'm
sorry.
Did
you
say
water?
Well,
we
all
envision
For
Evelyn,
As
you
might
imagine,
she
suffered
She
blamed
her
troubles
So
she
tried
to
kill
it.
-
All
babies
are
a
challenge.
But
Samara,
she
never
cried.
Never.
Except
when
her
mother
Then
she'd
scream
like
it
It
was
the
screaming
that
woke
us.

-
Evelyn,
don't!

Evelyn!
Evelyn,
stop!

She
was
trying
The
baby
was
taken
from
her,
Evelyn
was
institutionalized.
And
all
those
pictures
they
finally
made
sense.
Did
she
say
why
she
did
it?
She
felt
she
had
to
kill
I'm
here
to
see
a
patient.
-
I
don't
know
her
last
name.
That's
right.
Evelyn's
expecting
you.
Every
few
years,
one
of
you
She's
like
a
freakin'
Got
a
problem
with
your
kid,

Something
wrong?
That
song.
I
know
it.
Yeah.
They
all
do.
Hey,
Evelyn.
You
were
right
as
rain.
Hope
she's
some
help
Ten
minutes.
-

My
name's
Rachel.
But
you
know
that.

Some
days
I
A
feeling?
This
is
about
your
child.
It's...
-
It's
about
yours.
Samara.
They
don't
dream,
you
know.
The
dead
don't
dream.
Look,
something's
happened
-
You
have
to
sleep
to
dream.
And
the
dead
never
sleep.
They
wait...
...and
watch
for
a
way
back.
But
they
never
sleep.
-
That's
why
dreams
are
safe.
I
don't
have
a
lot
of
time.
I
have
to
know.
Why
did
you
try
Why?
Because
my
baby
told
me
to.
Just
like
yours
will
tell
you.
And
you
have
to
do
it.
-
You
have
to
send
it
back.
They
stopped
me.
-
Don't
let
them
stop
you.
Listen
to
the
voices.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Because
it's
our
fault.
We
did
it.
Yes.
We
did
it.
Yes.
It
was
you.
What
did
I
do?

my
son.

It's
all
right.
I'm
sorry,

What
did
I
do?
You
let
the

in.

Let's
go.
What
should
I
do?
Be
a
good
mother.
Listen
to
your
baby.
