Why
don't
you
call
your
boss
you're
taking
the
rest
It's
Friday
anyway,
What
do
I
do
with
my
free
afternoon?
Well,
we
could
laze
Checking-out
time
is
3:00
p.m.
Hotels
of
this
sort
aren't
but
when
your
time
is
up...
Oh,
Sam,
I
hate
having
to
be
with
you
I've
heard
of
married
couples
who
in
a
cheap
hotel.
When
you're
married
you
can
do
You
sure
talk
like
Oh,
Sam,
this
is
-
Yeah?
For
what?
For
meeting
you
in
secret
You
come
down
here
and
we
steal
lunch
hours.
I
wish
you
What
do
we
do
instead?
Oh,
I
have
to
go,
Sam.
-
I
can
come
down
next
week.
Not
even
just
to
see
you?
Oh,
we
can
see
each
other.
But
respectably.
In
my
house
with
my
mother's
my
sister
helping
me
broil
And
after
the
steak,
do
we
turn
Mama's
picture
to
the
wall?
Sam!
All
right.
Marion,
whenever
it's
possible,
And
under
any
circumstances,
You
make
respectability
I'm
all
for
it.
It
requires
patience,
Otherwise,
though,
But
if
I
can
see
you
and
touch
you
I'm
tired
of
sweating
I
sweat
to
pay
off
my
father's
I
sweat
to
pay
my
ex-wife
alimony,
on
the
other
side
of
the
world.
I
pay
too.
They
also
pay
A
couple
of
years
and
If
she
ever
remarries,
-
I
haven't
even
been
married
once
yet.
Oh,
Sam,
let's
get
married.
And
live
with
me
in
a
storeroom
We'll
have
lots
of
laughs.
When
I
send
my
ex-wife
her
alimony,
I'll
lick
the
stamps.
You
want
to
cut
this
off,
go
out
I'm
thinking
of
it.
How
could
you
even
-
Don't
miss
your
plane.
Mm-mm.
I'm
late
and,
uh,
Isn't

I'm

Now
that's...
That's
just
buying
off

That's
how

Ah,

Oh,

Marion,
what
in
Of
course
I'm
glad
to
see
you.
What
is
it,
Marion?

-


In
quite
a
hurry.
I
didn't
intend
to
sleep
so
long.
I
-
So,
I
decided
to
pull
over.
Yes.
As
I
said,
There
are
plenty
of
motels
I
mean,
just
to
be
safe.
I
didn't
intend
to
sleep
all
night.
Have
I
broken
any
laws?
-
No,
ma'am.
Is
anything
wrong?
Of
course
not.
Am

acting
-
Frankly,
yes.
-
Well,
is
there?
I've
told
you
there's
nothing
wrong,
and
you're
taking
up
my
time.
-
Now,
just
a
moment.
-
Turn
your
motor
off,
please.
May
I
see
your
licence?
-
Why?

Be
with
you
-
I'm
in
no
mood
for
trouble.
There's
an
old
saying:
"First

But
I'm
in
no
mood
for
it...
so
I'm
gonna
treat
you
so
fair

Can
I
trade
my

and
take
another?
Bein'
a
woman,
you
will.
Yes,
it's,
it's...
There's
Sick
of
the
sight
of
it.
Have
a
look
around
and
see
if
there's
and
I'll
have
my
mechanic
-
You
want
some
coffee?
and
just
wanna
make
a
change.
One
thing
people
never
oughta
be
and
that's
in
a
hurry,
but
like
I
said,
I'll
shoot
your

the
one
I'd
have

it
around
the

it
be
You

you
don't
want

are

not.

it's

really
rather
not.

might
as
well
be
perfectly
honest
with

what?
Is
there
about
making
a
decision
-
Do
you
think
I've
stolen
my
car?

right,


Just
put
it
in
here,
please.
Thank
you.

Heck,
I
saw
the
customer

chasin'
her?

I
better
have

She
look
like
a
wrong
one
to
you?
The
only
funny
thing,


No,
Mr.
Lowery,
but
then
she's
always
Buzz

to

are

Why
do
you
ask
that?

never
run
away

didn't
last
long,

in

you
should.
Oh,
I
do,
but
I
say
I
don't.
You
know,
if
anyone
ever
talked
the
way
she
spoke
to
you...
Sometimes
when
she
talks
I
feel
I'd
like
to
go
up
there
and
Or
at
least
defy
her.
But
I
know
I
can't.
She
sounded
strong.
No,
I
mean...
ill.
She
had
to
raise
me

herself,

you.
Well,

poor
substitute
Why
don't
you
go
away?
To
a
private
island,

I
couldn't
do
that.
She'd
be
alone
up
there.
The
fire
would
go
out.
It'd
be
cold
and
damp
If
you
love
someone,
you
don't
do
that
You
understand,

I
hate
what
she's
become.
Wouldn't
it
be
better

only
felt...
-
I
meant
well.

cluck
their
thick
tongues
oh,
so
very
delicately...
Of
course,
But
I
hate
to
even

about
it.

and
I'd
like
to

and

it's

late
Are
you
sure
you
wouldn't

I

just
for
talk.
All
right.
Well,
I'll
bring
you
some
breakfast,
-
What
time?
All
right,
Miss,
uh...
-

Good
night.









Ow!
No!
No!
Aaah!

[Sloshing,


So

I
haven't
Let's
see
what
they
say
They
tell
you
and
how
it's
guaranteed
to
exterminate
but
they
do
not
tell
you
And
I
say,
insect
or
man,
This

seems
to
claim
more
and
better

Sam!
-
Yes,

-
Oh,
sure.
Lila.
-
Well,
of
course
not.
Something
wrong?

-
She
left
home
on
Friday.
I
was
in
Tucson
over
the
weekend
Not
even
If
you
two
are
in
this
together,
but
I
want
Marion
to
tell
me
it's
none
Bob,
run
out
and
get
yourself
-
That's
okay.
I
brought
it
with
me.

Now,
what
thing
Sorry
about
the
tears.
Well,
is
Marion
in
trouble?

Let's
all
talk
about
Who
are
you,
My
name
is
Arbogast,
I'm
a
private
-
Where
is
she,
Miss
Crane?
I
know
you
don't,
because
if
you
did
What's
your
interest
Well,
$40,000.
-
$40,000?
One
of
you'd
better
tell
me
what's
going
Now,
take
it
easy,
It's
just
that
your
girlfriend
What
are
you
talking
about?
She
was
supposed
to
bank
it
on
Friday
-
No
one
has
seen
her
since.
Someone
always
sees
a
girl
They
don't
want
to
prosecute,
-
Sam,
if
she's
here...
Miss
Crane,
can
I
ask
you,
did
you
come
Oh,
not
even
a
hunch.
Well,
with
a
little
checking
I
don't
care
All
I
want
to
do
is
see
Marion
Did
you
check
Phoenix?
No,
she
was
seen
leaving
town
in
her
I
can't
believe
it.
We're
always
quickest
who
have
a
reputation
I
think
she's
here,
Where
there's
She's
not
back
there
with
the
nuts
and
I'll
find
her.


-
Evening.
I
almost
drove
I'm
always
forgetting
to
turn
Twelve,
in
fact.
-
Candy?
Last
two
days
I've
been
to
so
many
but
this
is
the
first
place
that
looks
To
tell
the
truth,
I
didn't
-
Just
doesn't
seem
like
See,
that
used
to
be
-
Wanna
register?
-
I
just
wanna
ask
a
few
questions.
I
always
change
the
beds
once
a
week
Hate
the
smell
of
dampness.
It's
such
You
out
to
buy
No.
Reason
I
ask,
you
said
you'd
seen
I
thought
maybe...
What,
uh...
What
was
it
I'm
looking
for
My
name's
Arbogast.
I've
been
trying
that's
been
missing
for,
It's
a
private
matter.
She's
not
I
didn't
think
the
police
went
looking
-
I'm
not
the
police.
We
have
reason
to
believe
she
came
No
one's
stopped
here
Mind
looking
at
the
picture
Commit
myself?
-
You
sure
talk
like
a
policeman.
-
Mm-mmm.
Yeah.
Well,
she
may
have
Marion
Crane's
but
she
could've
registered
I
tell
ya,
I
don't
even
much
bother
One
by
one,
I
shouldn't
even
bother
changing
Which
reminds
me...
-
What's
that?
A
couple
last
week
said
they
would've
thought
You
see,
Nobody'd
been
here
and
there's
a
couple
came
by
As
you
say,
This
girl
could've
registered
-
No.
All
right.
I'll
get
the
date
See,
there's
nobody.
Let's
see,
I
have
a
sample
Oh,
yes.
Here
we
are.
-
Marie
Samuels.
That's
an
interesting
-
Is
that
her?
Marie,
Marion.
-
Samuels.
Her
boyfriend's
name
is
Sam.
Mm-hmm.
Was
she
-
Wanna
check
the
picture
again?
Oh,
I
know
that.
It's
tough
keeping
track
I
know.
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
i-i-it
was
raining
I
tell
ya,
it's
not
really
No,
I
guess
not.
Tell
me
all
about
her.
Well,
um...
she
arrived,
um,
rather
late
and,
uh,
left
early
-
How
early?
Mm-hmm.
Uh,
the,
um...

-
Sunday.
-
Did
anyone
meet
her
here?
-
Did
she
arrive
with
anyone?
-
Did
she
make
any
phone
calls
or...
-
Locally?
-
Did
you
spend
the
night
with
her?
Then
how
would
you
know
Uh,
w-w...
Well,
she
was
very
tired
See,
l...
N-Now
I'm
starting
L-I'm
making
a
mental
picture
-
If
you
make
a
mental
picturization...
Um,
she
was...
N-No,
she
was
standing
back
there
She
said
she
had
to
because
she
had
a
long
d-d-dr-drive,
-
Mm-hmm.
Back
where?
No,
you
said
before
she
Yes,
b-back
in
my
parlour.
She
was
very
hungry,
and
then
she
said
she
was
tired
and
I
see.
-
Cash?
Cheque?
Cash,
huh?
-
After
she
left,
she
didn't
come
back?
Hmm.

Well,
M-Mr.
Arbogast,
uh,
L-I've
got
some
work
to
do,
To
tell
you
the
truth,
See,
if
it
doesn't
jell,
It's
not
coming
together.
Well,
l-l-I
don't
know
People
just
come
and
go,
That's
right.
No.
If
I
wanted
to
check
the
cabins,
all
If
you
don't
believe
me,
come
on
Oh.

Uh,
change
your
mind?
Oh.
You
know,
l...
I
think
I
have
one
of
-
Is
anyone
at
home?
Oh?
There's
somebody
-
N-N-No,
there
isn't.
Oh,
th-that
must
be
She's
an,
uh,
"inavlid..."
Uh,
it's
practically
Oh,
I
see.
If
this
girl,
Marion
Crane,
were
here,
-
No.
No.
Let's
say,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
You'd
know
-
You
wouldn't
be
made
a
fool
of.
And
I'm
not
capable
of
being
fooled,
-
This
is
not
a
slur
on
your
manhood.
She
might
have
fooled
me,
Then
your
mother
met
her.
No.
As
I
told
you,
Just
for
a
few
minutes.
There
might
be
Sick
old
women
-
I
wouldn't
disturb
her.
-
I
think
I've
talked
to
you
all
I
want.
It'd
be
much
better
Well,
all
right.
You
sure
would
save
me
a
lot
of
-
Would
I
need
a
warrant
for
that
too?
All
right.

Hello,

Let
me
talk
to
her,
Hello,
Lila.
Lila,

spent
last

was
in...

young

the
old

her
up.
-
That
wouldn't
be
wise.
-
I'm
going
out
there.
An
hour,
or
less.

Well,
I'm
going.
You'll
never

it.

you
and
this
detective
come
They
thought
-
Left
Phoenix
under
her
own
steam?
She's
not
missing
so
much

From
what?
She
stole
some
money.
A
lot?
Forty
thousand
dollars.
The
police
haven't
Everyone
concerned
thought
if
they
they
could
avoid
involving
her
That
explains
He
traced
her
What
exactly
did
he
say
He
said
Marion
was
there
-
With
the
$40,000?
about
the
money.
It
isn't

got
himself
a
hot
lead
probably
from
Norman

and
called

to
keep
you
still

no,

said
he
was
dissatisfied

this
one
-
A
private
detective,

of...
Arbogast.
And
after
he
left?
No,
that's...

This
detective
was
there,
the
detective
thanked
him
And
he
didn't
come

Your

told
you
because
he
was
going
to

You
hid
me
there
once,
boy,
and
you
Now
get
out!
-
I
told
you
to
get
out,
boy.
Norman,
what
do
you
Don't
you
touch
me!
Put
me
down!
Put
me
down!



-
Good
morning.
We
thought
we'd
drive
out
-
He's
already
been.
-
Did
you
two
have
breakfast?
Nothing.
Let's
What
did
he
say
Just
what
he
told
your
detective:
Saw
the
register
myself.
Saw
the
-
No
mother?
I
know
you're
not
but
no
woman
was
there
and
I
don't
I
still
feel
Can
see
you
do.
I'm
sorry
I
couldn't
Come
to
my
office
this
afternoon
and
The
sooner
you
drop
this
that's
the
sooner
you
stand
a
chance
How
'bout
that?
-
I
don't
know.
Come
to
the
house
and
do
your
reporting
You
too,
Sam.
Thank
you.
-
Maybe
I
am
the
seeing-illusions
type.
-
You
want
me
to
drop
you
at
the
hotel...
I
still
won't
feel
satisfied
Neither
will
I.
We
better
decide
what
we're
gonna
say
We're
going
to
register
We're
going
to
and
then
we're
going
to
search
every
[Truck
Door
Opens,
I
wonder
where
Norman
Bates
Someone's
at
that
window.
Come
on.
-
Well?
Uh-huh.
We
were
gonna
try
to
make
it
but
we
don't
like
the
look
Looks
like
a
bad
day
coming,
-
I'll
take
you
to
cabin
ten.
That's
not
necessary.
My
boss
is
paying
for
this
trip
He
wants
practically
I'd
better
sign
in
Thank
you.
-
I'll
get
your
bags.
-
I'll
show
you
the
room,
then.
You
check
in
any
other
place
-
and
you
have
to
pay
in
advance.

That
receipt.
I'll
go
on
ahead.

All
right,
there's
Don't
bother
yourself.
Sam,
we
have
to
go
into
that
cabin
no
matter
what
we're
afraid
of
I
know.
Do
you
think
if
something
I
don't
know,
but
if
you
had...
a
useless
business
like
this
motel,
To
get
a
new
business
somewhere
else?
How
could
we
prove
that...
If
he
opens
a
motel
on
There
must
be
some
proof
something
that
proves
he
got
-
What
makes
you
sound
so
certain?
Or
he
felt
sorry
for
me
the
same
way
about
you.
I
could
tell
the
last
time
He
wouldn't
have
gone
anywhere
or
done
unless
he
was
stopped.
And
he
was
stopped.
So
he
must
We'll
start
with
cabin
one.
If
he
sees
us,
Bates.
No
shower
curtain.
-
Sam!
Look!
It's
figuring.
It
didn't
Some
figure
has
been
added
to
That
proves
Marion
was
here.
Bates
never
denied
she
was
here.
Oh.
Doesn't
that
prove
Do
we
simply
ask
him
But
that
old
woman,
whoever
she
is,
I
want
her
to
tell
us
-
You
can't
go
up
there.
-
Bates.
One
of
us
can
keep
him
occupied
while
You'll
never
be
able
to
hold
him
I
don't
like
you
going
I
can
handle
a
sick
old
woman.
All
right,
I'll
find
Bates
Wait
a
minute.
If
you
get
anything
can
you
find
your
way
Yes,
of
course.
If
you
do
get
anything,
-
You
looking
for
me?
Wife's
taking
a
nap
and...
I
never
can
keep
quiet
enough
for
her,
-
Good.
You
satisfied
with
your
cabin?
I've
been
doing
all
the
talking
I
thought
it
was
the
people
who
did
all
the
talking
Here
you
are
-
You
are
alone
here,
aren't
you?
Drive
me
crazy.
I
think
that
would
be
a
rather
Just
an
expression.
What
I
meant
was,
-
Wouldn't
you?
-



I'm
not
saying
you
I'm
just
doubting
that
you
are.
I
think
if
you
saw
a
chance
to
get
out
This
place?
This
place
happens
I
grew
up
in
that
house.
My
mother
and
I
You
look
frightened.
Have
I
been
I
don't
know
I've
been
talking
about
your
mother,
-
How
you
gonna
do
it?
Buy
a
new
one
in
a
new
town
where
you
Why
don't
you
just
get
in
Where
will
you
get
the
money
to
do
that?
-
Shut
up!
I
bet
your
mother
knows
where
the
money
I
think
Where's
that
girl
you
came
here
with?
Mrs
Bates,
it's...
-


Norman
Bates!

If
anyone
gets
any
answers
Even
I
couldn't
get
to
Norman
-
You
warm
enough,
miss?
Did
he
talk
No.
I
got
the
whole
story,
but
not
from
Norman
Bates
He
only
half-existed
And
now
the
other
half
probably
for
all
time.
Did
he
kill
my
sister?
Yes...
and
no.
Now
look,
if
you're
trying
to
lay
for
some
sort
of
plea

A
psychiatrist
He
merely
tries
-
But
my
sister
is...
Yes,
I'm
sorry.
If
you
drag
that
swamp
somewhere
in
Uh,
have
you
any
unsolved
-
Yes,
two.
-
Did
he
confess
to...
the
"mother."
To
understand
it
the
way
I
understood
that
is
from
the
"mother"
half
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
time
when
Norman
murdered
He
was
already
dangerously
disturbed,
His
mother
was
and
for
years
the
two
of
them
lived
as
Then
she
met
a
man...
and
it
seemed
to
Norman
that
That
pushed
him
over
the
line
Matricide
is
probably
the
most
most
unbearable
So
he
had
to
erase
the
crime,
He
stole
her
corpse.
A
weighted
coffin
He
hid
the
body
even
treated
it
to
keep
it
And
that
still
She
was
there...
So
he
began
to
think
give
her
half
his
life,
At
times
he
could
be
both
personalities,
At
other
times,
the
"mother"
half
He
was
never
all
Norman,
and
because
he
was
so
he
assumed
that
she
Therefore,
if
he
felt
a
strong
the
"mother"
side
of
him
When
he
met
your
sister...
he
was
touched
by
her,
He
wanted
her.
That
set
off
the
jealous
"mother"
After
the
murder
Norman
returned
and,
like
a
dutiful
son,
covered
up
he
was
convinced
Why
was
he...
He's
a
transvestite.
Uh,
not
exactly.
A
man
who
dresses
in
women's
clothing
or
satisfaction,
But
in
Norman's
case,
he
was
simply
to
keep
alive
the
illusion
And
when
reality
when
danger
or
desire
he
dressed
up,
even
to
He'd
walk
about
the
house,
He
tried
to
be
And,
uh,
now
he
is.
That's
what
I
meant
when
I
said
You
see,
when
the
mind
there's
always
In
Norman's
case,
and
the
dominant
personality
And
the
$40,000?
The
swamp.
These
were
He
feels
a
little
chill.
-
Oh,
sure.


It's
sad
when
that
condemn
her
own
son...
but
I
couldn't
allow
them
They'll
put
him
away
now,
He
was
always
bad,
he
intended
to
tell
them
I
killed
as
if
I
could
do
anything
like
one
They
know
I
can't
even
I'll
just
sit
here
and
be
quiet,
They're
probably
watching
me.
Let
them
see
I'm
not
even
I
hope
they
are
watching.
They'll
see
and
they'll
say,
"Why,
she
