Damn

Damn

I

Oh,

you

Da

Who's
that?
Not
your
business.
Not

Linda...
...I
cracked
the

You
cracked
it?
Look
at
this.
Watch.
Eleven
months
and
you
suddenly
come
up
The
usual.
Coffee
and
Twinkies.
I
hate
you.
Can
you
find
Matt
and
get
to
the
lab?
I
think
I
can
find
him.
When
will
you
be
in?
Well,
it
should
be
daylight
So
I
should
call
the
Nobel
committee
I'll
see
you
in
a
few.
Matt.
Sebastian
called.
What's
the
rush?
He
cracked
reversion.
You're
kidding.
-
When?
You
want
a
ride?
Maybe
we
should
take
our
own
cars.
I'm
tired
of
this
You're
gonna
have
to
tell
him
I
will,
eventually.
I'm
just
waiting
for
the
right

Good

Sorry,

Come

Calm
down,

Good

It's
okay.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
Hold
still.
Isabelle?
She's
more
aggressive
these
days.
That's
what
tranquillizers
are
for.
She's
been
gone
too
long.

You
take

of
that

Ten

You're

the

How
can
you
justify
injecting

Because
it'll
save
time.
Then
you
can
mop
up
afterwards.
You
think
I'm
trying
to
kill
Isabelle?

Kill?
More
like

Well,
your
objections
are
duly
noted
Yes,
sir.
How
come
when
you
say,
"Yes,
sir,"
Practise.
How'd
you
convince
me
to
hire
her?
You
wanted
the

the
U.S.

She
cares
more
about

So
this

He's

Well,

Come

I

you'd

There's

Did
I

Aren't

Yeah,
I

we
were

You
were
great.
I
was
just
standing

Come

We

Yeah,
we
had

I'd

Well,
maybe

Or
not.
What's
it
like?
Four
years

How
have
you
solved

I
haven't.
But
we're
close.
We
just
need
more

Ever
since
you
walked
in

...I
knew
you
were
different.
Over
the
years,

Thank
you,

Well,

What
just
happened

I
wasn't

Being

Can
I
explain?
Once
they
know
we've
completed
it...
...what's
to
stop
them
from

Why
would
they?
But
it's
their

It
may
be
their
project,

What
are
you
proposing?
Phase
Three?
Are
you
nuts?
You
can't
jump
into
human
testing.
You
don't
make
history
with
rules.
You
want
to
be
the
first
one.
This
is
not
about
me,
it's
about
us.
Now
is
our
chance.
How
did
you
get
clearance
-
I
volunteered.
They
approved.
You're
kidding.
You
volunteered?
Are
you
insane?
Jonas
Salk

the

Yeah,
I'm
pretty
sure
he
was.
Shit.
In
the
past
four
weeks,

The
results
speak
for
themselves.
Sarah,
I
thought
you'd
be
happy.
Moving
this
fast
is
bad
science,
-
I
can't
believe
they
approved
this.
You
would.
If
we're
to
move
forward,
I'll
stay
shifted
for
3
days
and
then
Fuck,
yes.
Can
I
count
on
your
best
work?
Good.
How
did
we
let
him
talk
us
into
this?
Can
we
talk
about
it
later?
I'm
trying
to
make
love
to
you.
We're
risking
our
professional
Yes,
Matt,
I
realize.
Then
why
did
we
agree
to
it?
Because
maybe
we
both
know
that
-
Let
me
ask
another
question.
Ever
miss
being
with
him?
Why
do
you
ask
that?
Because
he
sets
the
bar
pretty
high.
Let
me
tell
you
a
little
secret.
The
concept
of
Sebastian

Sebastian
himself.
We're
ready
for
you.
See
you
later.

It's

We

You
can,
but

It's

I
feel
the
same,
You're

I'm
right
here.
-
Where?
Looking
at

Or,
rather,
not
looking
at

Hey,
how's
he
doing?
Why
don't
you
ask
Sebastian?
-
How
do
you
feel?
Just
want
to
set
the
mood.
It's

So,
what's
it
like

Ghosts

Sorry.
I
couldn't

Okay,
now
I

I
wonder
where
he
is
now.
Well,
I
see
the

He
just
brushed
by

Do
you

You
got

Okay.
Bye.
Are
you

Sebastian?
Are
you

I
know
you're

So
how
was
your

Hard

you
do?
Got

Sarah
mentioned
you
weren't
I
got
a
cup

In
the
future,
you
want
to
tell
...just
in
case
something
I'm
touched
by
your
concern,
We
don't
want
it
to
become

Everything's
normal.
All
right,
let's
get
these
off.
You
okay?
Yeah.
Why?
You
seem
a
little
nervous.
No,
I'm
fine.
Are
you

No.
Why?
No
reason.

What
was
the

"I
like
my

like

Maybe
he
meant
cold
and
bitter.
I
gotta
take
a
leak.
-
I'll
try,
but
I
can't
promise.
It'd
be
freaky,
but
it'd
settle
down.
No,
what
would
you
do
if
you
knew
It
gives
me
the
creeps.
I
can't
take

you

There's

You
have
no
idea
how
much

this
is.
I'm
sure
I'll
have
my
chance.
Hey,
relax.
It's
my
last
night,
so
I
thought
Can
you
guess
what
this
is?
What?
How
did
it
feel?
A
little
too
familiar.
Want
to
know
what
it's
like
-
It'd
just
be
like
old
times.
You
were
never
there.
Well,
I'm
here
now.
We
talked
about
this
once,
remember?
What?
You
wondered
if
you'd
know
Sebastian,
I
do
know
the
difference.
It's
not
what
I
don't
see.
Get

So
I

No.

It's

Let's
see
if
we
can't

Before

Goddamn

I
lost

Are
you
any
closer?
You
know,
I
can't

My

told

that

can
do

But

I
gotta
have

Hold

Come

way!
I
can't
take
much
more
testing.
I
know
how
hard
it
is.
Bullshit.
You
don't
know
anything.
This
isn't
easy
for
any
of
us.
Fuck
you,
Matt!
It
is
easy
for
you.
I
was
to
be
in
phase-shift
It's
been
10
fucking
days,
all
right?!
Ten
days
of
tissue
tests,
radiation
I
can't
fucking
take
it
anymore.
-
What
I
meant
was...
And
don't
ever...
Don't
ever
tell
me
There
she
is.
I'd
suck
the
tits
right
off
of
you.
Dr.
Caine,
what's
going
on?
Just
stopped
by
to
let
you
know
Wait.
Going
out?
Dr.
Caine.
What
do
you
mean?
If
I
don't
get
out,
I'll
go
nuts.
-
You
can't
leave
the
compound.
-
It's
the
rule.
-
Authorization.
-
Confirmed.
I'm
not
gonna
spend
my
life
I'm
going
out!
Be
back
Oh,
shit!
-
Hello?
-
How's
it
going,
Ed?
-
I
haven't
seen
you
in
a
while.
Work,
work,
work.
I
was
beginning
to
worry
because
Thanks
a
lot,
Ed.
But
everything's
cool.
Hey,
look.
Look.
-
Look
at
that.
-
Oh,
my
God.
-
Mommy!
Mommy!
-
What?
-
Don't
be
ridiculous.
I'll
meet
you
at
the
lab.
I'll
see
you
there.
He
could
be
here.
He
could
be
anywhere.
Shit.
Don't
even
think
about
it.
Who's
gonna
know?
Oh,
shit.
Matt,
it's
me.
He
was
here.
No,
he
took
his
mask
off.
He
must
be
outside
somewhere.
I'm
coming
back
to
the
lab.
How?
How
am
I
supposed
to
do
that?
You
say
you
want
us
to
shoot
him?
It's
not
a
monkey,
it's
Dr.
Caine.
I
don't
give
a
rat's
ass
if
we
are.
If
someone
finds
out
what
he
is,
Jeez,
relax.
-
Can
I
still
shoot
him?
I
told
Carter.
I
was
getting
stir-crazy.
Bullshit.
I
went
to
your
apartment.
You
did
more
than
"pick
up
stuff."
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
What
did
you
see
in
my
apartment?
I
saw
your
face,
your
clothes.
Sebastian,
in
public.
I'm
still
project
leader.
You're
right.
It's
your
decision.
But
if
you
leave
again,
I
swear
Throw
your
career
away?
Not
likely.
Try
me.
So
that's
it,
huh?
I'm
officially
a
lab
rat.
You
volunteered.
Next
time
you
do
inventory,
Yeah,
sure.
Let's
pack
it
up
and
go
home.
-
Exercise
wheel?
Was
he
serious?
The
committee
knows
what
we've
done,
-
Shit,
Lin!
-
I
can't
believe
you
did
that!
All
I
ask
is
please,
-
Think
she'll
say
anything?
-
She
doesn't
worry
me.
He's
gone
longer
than
the
animals.
What
if
it
already
has?
Hold
still.
Good.
-
So
what
was
it
like?
-
When
you
were
out
in
the
world.
You
just
walked
around.
Like
what?
Man,
if
it
was
me...
...I'd
be
fucking
with
people,
I'd
be
hanging
out
at
Victoria's
Childish,
don't
you
think?
No.
Well,
it
was
late.
Did
you
see
anybody?
There
was
this
one
girl.
-
Did
you
mess
with
her?
Well,
maybe
I
scared
her
a
little.
How'd
that
feel?
I
liked
it.
Nice.
Lin,
remember
the
B
and
C?
55
percent
reversion.
Protein
structure
was
a
dead
end.
Key
75
percent.
80
percent.
-
82.
We've
got
it.
No,
it's
slowing.
-
Be
an
optimist.
88.
92
percent.
93
percent.
94
percent.
95
percent.
-
No!
-
Cellular
bonds
are
collapsing.
Some
breakthrough.
If
I
were
on
a
table
right
now,
Don't
tempt
me.
We're
closer,
which
counts.
Closer!
He
just
traded
quantum
-
It's
ludicrous.
-
You're
pissed
you
didn't
think
of
it.
95
percent?
Asshole.
You're
a
moron.
What
is
your
problem?
Matt
is
onto
something
and
Yeah,
he's
onto
something,
all
right.
He's
on
my
coattails.
Get
off
your
fucking
pedestal.
Or
kill
me.
And
you
know
what
the
sad
part
is?
I
have
this
gift
and
So
now
it's
a
gift.
Damn
right
it's
a
gift.
If
you
weren't
so
shortsighted,
you'd
If
you
weren't
so
shortsighted,
you'd
My
life?
I
have
no
fucking
life.
I'm
a
prisoner.
-
No,
you're
not
a
prisoner.
Is
that
what
you
think
when
Is
that
how
you
alleviate
...when
I'm
stuck
in
this
shithole
...fucking
your
boyfriend?
What
bothers
you
most?
That
you
don't
have
a
life...
...or
that
I
do?
Frank,
I'm
coming
down
to
the
lab.
Don't
you
sleep?
-
Da
Vinci
never
slept.
I
know
Virginio
Virginio
I
know
No,
no,
no,
no.
Motherfucker...
If
you
were
any
later,
Jesus!
I
don't
see
anything.
Hello?
No.
No,
he's
here.
Yes,
I'm
sure.
I'm
staring
at
him.
Is
something
wrong?
-
You
want
me
to
wake
him?
Who
the
fuck
does
she
think
she
is?
I'm
not
good
enough
for
her?
I'll
show
them
both
how
good
I
am.
Quiet!
Quiet!
You
want
to
fuck
with
me,
bitch?
You
know
what
happens
when
Don't
worry.
It's
really
pretty
clever.
What
do
we
do
now?
Go
after
him?
No.
We're
going
to
the
committee.
Shouldn't
we
wait
and
talk
to
him?
He
killed
a
dog
with
his
bare
hands.
-
You
were
there?
...with
absolute
disregard
-
What's
he
done?
-
Are
we
in
trouble?
We'll
take
responsibility.
-
What
do
we
do
when
he
comes
back?
The
committee
will
bring
security.
We'll
brief
you
tomorrow
morning.
I
had
a
lot
of
faith
in
you,
I
know
what
we
did
was
wrong.
Wrong
doesn't
even
begin
Let's
leave
it
here.
I'll
call
General
Caster
and
You
go
back
to
the
lab.
Is
there
anything
we
can
do?
You
might
think
about
For
what
it's
worth,
A
little
late
for
apologies.
Howard?
What
was
that
about?
-
Just
a
screwup
at
work.
Bad
enough
to
wake
a
few
generals.
Hi,
boss.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Howard!
-
Why
so
jumpy?
No
"good
morning"
for
me
today?
You
don't
love
me
anymore.
-
Just
in
a
hurry.
It's
going
to
be
a
busy
day.
When
did
he
get
back?
Three
a.m.
He's
been
wandering
Kramer
called
yet?
He's
probably
still
meeting
We
should
have
heard
something.
Hello,
is
Dr.
Kramer
there?
What?
Oh,
my
God.
-
What's
wrong?
-
What?
General
Caster,
please.
There's
no
dial
tone.
-
There's
no
outside
line
here
either.
-
Authorization,
please.
Authorization
invalid.
That's
a
first.
McKay
1
-Delta-835.
Authorization
invalid.
Let
me
try
mine.
Kensington
2-Romeo-159.
Authorization
invalid.
We've
got
a
problem.
I
don't
believe
this.
-
When
will
they
start
looking
for
us?
-
Can
you
hack
into
the
system?
-
Some
security
system.
Someone's
more
extraordinary
than
me.
-
What
is
it?
Our
access
codes
have
been
removed.
-
So
we're
trapped?
Let
me
have
one.
He's
not
in
here.
Okay,
Sebastian,
fun's
over.
Sorry,
Linda,
but
I
can't
Sebastian,
where
are
you?
You
have
no
idea
what
it's
like.
The
power
of
it,
the
freedom.
Whatever
you're
planning,
...it's
not
gonna
work.
No,
they
don't.
Kramer
died
before
I
saw
to
that.
Jesus.
-
You
realize
what
you're
saying?
...when
you
don't
have
to
look
-
Sebastian.
Shit!
Where's
Janice?
She
was
right
behind
us.
Oh,
fuck.
Oh,
fuck.
Oh,
my
God!
In
there.
-
Darts.
Oh,
my
God.
Shit!
Oh,
my
God.
She
was
right
behind
us.
How
could
he
do
this?
He
snapped.
He
fucking
snapped.
It's
worse.
-
He's
thought
this
through.
He
knew
we
were
going
to
turn
him
in.
He
knew
that
his
career
would
be
...is
to
make
sure
no
one
knows
-
Which
means
he'll
get
rid
of
us.
-
You
could've
stopped
this!
-
You
risked
our
lives!
Don't
tell
her
to
shut
up!
I
don't
care
if
she's
right!
I
just
want
to
know,
Frank,
can
you
restore
the
codes?
-
I'll
try.
We
are
not
gonna
wait.
Ever
use
this
thing
before?
We
designed
it
to
help
find
Too
small
for
thermal
scans.
-
Connecting.
Activating
motion
detectors.
We've
got
movement.
-
Corridor
six.
Got
it.
-
Check.
-
Matt,
be
careful.
-
Ready?
Take
a
left
at
the
next
corridor.
Could
we
trap
him
in
corridor
eight?
-
lf
he
keeps
heading
that
way.
-
Anything?
There's
a
ladder
in
Shit,
I
lost
him.
-
I
lost
him.
It's
me.
It's
me.
-
You
have
anything?
How
did
he
get
by
us?
He
couldn't
have.
There.
Behind
the
pipes.
Dr.
Caine?
-
Can
you
hear
me?
Cover
me.
Covered.
It's
just
a
vent.
Let
him
go!
Let
him
fucking
go!
Matt,
what's
happening?
Carter's
down!
He's
hurt
bad!
Get
out
of
there.
Where
the
fuck
is
Sebastian?!
Shit.
He's
right
on
top
of
you!
-
Where's
he
headed?!
The
doors
are
closing!
-
You
have
him?
He's
still
there.
-
Where?
He's
coming
at
you!
I
got
thermals
all
over
the
place.
I'm
losing
resolution!
He's
pumping
out
heat.
The
air's
the
same
temperature
-
He's
trapped.
-
It's
not
safe.
-
We
shouldn't
separate!
Marco.
Polo.
Marco.
You
missed.
-
Now'd
be
a
good
time
to
pay
that
tab.
Come
on!
What
happened
to
you?
Was
it
the
serum
that
fucked
you
up,
Aren't
you
the
fucked
up
one?!
...no
life
except
the
one
-
Even
with
Linda.
Jesus
Christ,
I
can't
imagine
what
I'm
not
a
deranged
asshole!
No,
but
you're
weak!
I
thought
killing
you
would
be
hard!
Oh,
my
God.
Fuck!
His
pulse
-
He'll
be
okay!
-
He's
gonna
be
okay!
Keep
applying
pressure
-
Where
you
going?
-
Wait
for
the
others!
Fuck!
God,
I
told
them
to
meet
us
here.
Oh,
God.
Come
on.
Give
me
one
step,
Move!
Fuck.
Quite
a
mess.
Fuck!
You
motherfuck...
Get
off!
-
We
had
so
much
fun
the
last
time.
Sweet
dreams.
You
know...
...I've
always
admired
Goddamn
it,
Carter!
Sarah,
I'm
losing
him!
-
Where
is
she?
-
She
went
alone?
He's
dead.
Come
on.
Wait.
Keep
spraying.
Oh,
no.
Nothing.
What's
happening?!
She's
dead,
isn't
she?
Motherfucker!
Jesus.
I
got
it.
I
got
it.
Oh,
God!
-
Fuck.
Have
fun
with
your
boyfriend.
We're
locked
in.
How
bad?
You're
losing
blood,
-
Frank?
I
gotta
find
something
Shit.
Talk
to
me.
Everything
is
spinning.
-
Are
you
still
with
me?
Can
you
feel
this?
A
little.
Come
on.
I
need
you
to
fight
this.
-
I
need
you
to
stay
awake.
Come
on.
Talk
to
me.
Talk
to
me!
Hello,
face.
We
are
not
gonna
die
in
here.
I'll
be
back
with
help.
I
promise.
-
Authorization,
please.
-
Confirmed.
-
I
can't
let
you
leave.
Oh,
yes,
I
do.
You
think
you're
God?
I
always
knew
you
were
a
bitch!
Bitch!
No
wonder
it
didn't
work
out
Stay
the
fuck
away
from
her!
Thought
I'd
save
you
for
a
change.
Come
on.
I
heard
an
explosion!
-
Don't
touch
it!
-
It's
nitro.
No,
we
can't!
Come
on!
There's
a
ladder
in
the
elevator.
-
Can
you
climb?
You
go
first.
Move!
Oh,
shit.
Stick
to
the
side!
It's
coming
back
down!
Down!
Go
down!
Holy
shit.
We
better
go
before
it
slips.
Get
off
of
me!
Get
off
of
me!
-
Let
go
of
me!
For
old
times'
sake.
Go
to
hell.
Come
on.
Oh,
my
God.
Not
God.
Not
anymore.
