Manuel.
Manuel!

Manuel.



MAN:
I
think
I
found
you
one.
Look,
I
called
you,
right?
Soon
as
I
couldn't
pull
it
out
myself,

It's
okay,
it's
okay.
It's
okay.


This
is
Constantine.
John
Constantine,
asshole.

Sure.


What
the
hell?

I
need
a
mirror.
Now.
At
least
3
feet
high.
Move!
Go,
now!

CHAS:
Chas
Kramer,
asshole.
Asshole.
What?
Oh,
this
is
Kramer.
JOHN:
Chas!
-
Move
the
car.
Move
the
damn
car!

"chas,
move
the
car."
There,
car's
moved.

Lift
it
up
over
the
bed.
Tie
that
end
off.
Close
your
eyes.


No!

Smile
pretty,
you
vain
prick.
For
your
boss.

Pull
it!

Ma?
Ma?

Like
I
said,
I
found
you
something,
What
happened
in
there?
Going
to
a
lot
of
meetings,
I
see.
HENNESS
Y:
I
have
to
sleep,
John.
I
need
some
help,
Father.
You
do?
From
me?
What
kind
of...?
-
Hey,
listen,
l...
Listen
to
the
ether.
Anything
unusual,
you
let
me
know.
come
on,
you
don't
need
its
protection.
A
few
days.
Okay.
Okay.
For
you,
John.
CHAS:
John,
why
would
you
do
that
-
I
told
you
to
move
it.
...but
if
you'd
told
me
that
it
was
a
300-pound
...I
would've
moved
it
further,
John.
JOHN:
Take
Alvarado.
You
ever
think
if
you
told
me
more
now
-
No?
CHAS:
Of
course
it's
a
nope.
Bless
me,
Father,
for
I
have
sinned.
It's
been...
...
two
weeks
since
my
last
confession.
I
killed
a
man
today.
Another
one.
I
didn't
even
see
his
face,
I
just...
...pulled
the
trigger,
and
he
went
away.
Most
cops
go
20
years
Why
do
I
always
know
Where
to
aim,
when
to
fire.
I'm
wondering,
is
there
Something
damned?
GARRET:
God
has
a
plan
for
you.
You
mustn
't
let
your
faith
ANGELA:
I'm
trying
real
hard.
MALE
VOICE:
Isabel.


JOHN:
Things
most
people
never
even
heard
of.
And
now
I'm
gonna
be
done
in
by
this.
Wouldn't
be
the
first,
John.
Come
on,
Les.
You
saved
me
before,
This
is
aggressive.
Twenty
years
ago,
Now
you
don't
wanna
leave.
Yeah,
that's
a
good
idea.
John,
you
really
need
to
prepare.

-
Make
arrangements.
I
already
know
exactly
where
I'm
going.
-
Morning.
-
Good
morning.
-

No,
no,
no.
You
don't
need
to
see
this,
okay?
No.
Give
us
the
room,
please.
Isabel.
She
fell
from
the
roof?
WEISS:
-
No.
...I
know
it's
hard
to
accept.
-
Isabel
wouldn't
kill
herself.
-
She
wouldn't
kill
herself.
ANGELA:
Period.
Period!
WEISS:

-
Hold
the
door.
You

down?
[PAUL

A

The

The

-
Humor
me.

Oh,
yeah,
that's...
How
you
feeling,
John?
So,
what's
new?
Uh...
Bullet
shavings
from
...holy-water
ampoules
...and...
Oh,
you'll
love
this.

Yeah,
it's
funny
to
you,
but
to
the
What
is
it,
exactly,
with
you
and
bugs?
I
just
like
them.
Yeah.
Who
doesn't?
Yeah,
easy
there,
hero.
-
That's
dragon's
breath.
Yeah,
well,
I...

...know
a
guy
who
knows
a
guy.

So,
what's
the
action?
I
just
pulled
a
soldier
demon
Looked
like
it
was
trying
Yeah,
I
know
how
it
sounds.
No,
we're
finger
puppets
...not
doorways.
They
can
work
us,
but
they
can't
Check
the
scrolls
anyway.
Sure
thing,
John.
Uh...
Anything
else?
Wouldn't
happen
to
have
On
the
house.
CHAS:
All
right,
question.
How
much

You're
not
my
slave,
Chas.
You're
my
very
appreciated
apprentice.
Like
Tonto
or
Robin.
Or
that
skinny
fellow
Right.
So
then
why
don't
I
apprentice
John?
John.
I
love
our
little
talks,
John.
May
I
take
your
coat,
Mr.
Constantine?
No,
thanks,
ATTENDANT:
How
about
you,
ma'am?
I
really
need
to
speak
with
him.
First
come,
first
served.
Oh.
So
you're
rude
-
Father.
-
You
have
news.
ANGELA:
I
know
what
you
want,
son.
Still
keeping
your
all-seeing
eye
I'm
flattered.
Well,
I
could
offer
something...
...about
how
a
shepherd
leads
...but
it
might
sound
disingenuous.
She
has
to
have
a
Catholic
funeral,
-
Angela,
it's
still
considered
a
mortal
sin.
The
bishop
believes
otherwise.
Oh,
rules.
Father.
David.
This
is
Isabel.
God
was
the
only
one
Please.
I'm
sorry.
JOHN:
I've
been
seeing
some
You
might
consider
I
could
do
your
side
some
good
You
still
trying
to
buy
your
way
What
about
the
minions
-
That
alone
should
guarantee
my
entry.
That's
not
the
way
this
works.
Why,
haven't
I
served
him
enough?
-
What
does
he
want
from
me?
Self-sacrifice,
belief.
-
Oh,
I
believe,
for
chrissake.
And
there's
a
difference.
You've
seen.
I
never
asked
to
see.
A
gift,
John.
One
that
you've
squandered
I'm
pulling
demons
out
of
little
girls.
Who's
that
for?
Everything
you've
ever
done,
To
earn
your
way
Impossible
rules,
endless
regulations...
...who
goes
up,
who
goes
down

You
don't
even
understand
us.
You're
the
one
who
should
go
Why
me,
Gabriel?
It's
personal,
isn't
it?
I
didn't
go
to
church
enough,
...I
was
5
bucks
short
You
are
going
to
die
young
because...
...you
smoked
30
cigarettes
And
you're
going
to
go
to
hell...
...because
of
the
life
you
took.
You're
fucked.

At
least
it's
nice
out.
He
always
had
a
rotten
sense
of
humor.
And
his
punch
lines
are
killers.
CHAS:
Constantine,
it's
raining!

Hello?





MAN:

Should've
minded

I
know
where
you're
going,
John.
You're
supposed
to
wait
in
the
cab.
It's
a
haven
for
those
who
rise
and
fall.

You
read
too
much,
kid.
It's
a

It's

John,
the
man's
a
legend.
Can
you
please
get
me
I'm
begging
you,
John,
please?
-
Sure,
you
can
get
in.
If
you
can
get
in.
If
I
can
get...?
It's
a

though,
right?

I'm

Of
course
it
is.
Rat

I'm
just

I'm
just
testing.


JOHN:
MIDNITE:
Have
you
come
here
with
relics
to
sell?
No,
I'm
out
of
that
now.
Perhaps
peddling
forgeries
has
ended
up
Midnite,
Jesus...
...I
thought
the
thing
was
authentic.
I
see
now.
Your
health
is
bad
for
other
reasons.
A
few
months,
maybe
a
year.
I
thought
I
heard
thunder
last
night.
Must
have
been
You're
the
one
soul
he'd
come
So
I've
heard.
Well,
I
am
most
certain
...for
a
sympathetic
shoulder
A
demon
just
attacked
me,
They
don't
like
you,
John.
How
many
have
you
Not
some
angry
half-breed,
Midnite.
Clearly
I
do
not
have
to
remind
you
And
yesterday
I
saw
a
soldier
demon...
...trying
to
chew
its
way
out
Listen,
John,
demons
stay
in
hell,
...the
great
dtente
Thanks
for
the
history
lesson,
Midnite.
Now...
...I
need
to
use
the
chair.
John,
forgetting
the
fact
that
it
would
...you
know
I
am
neutral.
And
as
long
as
the
balance
Before
you
were
a
bartender...
...you
were
one
witch
doctor
-
And
l...
The
John
Constantine.
Once.
This
isn't
the
usual
game,
I
can
feel
it.
Something's
coming.
MAN:
Balthazar.
That
expression
alone
I'll
make
your
night.
I'll
deport
your
sorry
ass
right
where
You
know
the
rules
of
my
house.
BALTHAZAR:
Word
is
you're
on
your
way
down.
Fresh
meat.

Finger-licking
good.
We
have
a
meeting
now,
John.

What?
I
didn't
catch
that.
Welcome
to
my
life.

Mr.
Constantine.
-
I
saw
you...
-
And
then
I
saw
you
at
the...
I'd
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions,
I'm
not
really
in
the
talking
mood
Well,
maybe
you
could
just
listen
then.
Please?
Always
a
catch.
My
sister
was
murdered
yesterday.
-
Sorry
to
hear.
She
was
a
patient
at
Ravenscar.
JOHN:
ANGELA:
Yeah,
well,
Isabel
wouldn't
Yeah,
what
kind
of
mental
patient
That's
just
crazy.
Look,
I've
heard
your
name
I
know
the
circles
you
travel
in.
Just
before
my
sister
was
committed,
She
started
talking
about
demons,
Now,
I
think
someone
got
to
her,
I
think
they
brainwashed
her
Some
kind
of
legion
or
cult.
Sounds
like
a
theory,
detective.
Good
luck.
I
thought
with
your
background,
...point
me
in
the
right
direction.
Yeah,
okay,
sure.
It
wasn't
a
suicide.
My
sister
was
a
devout
Catholic.
Do
you
understand
that?
Her
soul
would
go
straight
to
hell...
...where
she'd
be
ripped
apart
over
...for
all
eternity.
That
it?
That
about
right?
Goddamn
you.


JOHN:
What
if
I
told
you
that
God
...a
kind
of
standing
bet
I'd
tell
you
to
stay
on
your
meds.
Humor
me.
No
direct
contact
with
-
Just
influence.
See
who
would
win.
-
Why?
-
Maybe
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
No
telling.
It's
fun
when
a
man
beats
his
wife
to
And
you
think
the
devil
is
responsible?
People
are
evil,
Mr.
Constantine.
People.
You're
right.
We're
born
Then
sometimes
something
else
comes
Well,
this
has
been
real
educational...
...but
I
don't
believe
in
the
devil.
You
should.
He
believes
in
you.
It's
a
power
outage.
Not
likely.

ANGELA:
What?
What
is
that?
Wings.
Maybe
talons.
You're
kidding.
Of
what?
Something
that's
not
That's
really
not
going
to
help.
-
Close
your
eyes.
JOHN:
Demons
stay
in
hell,
huh?
Tell
them
that.

Don't
worry.
Happens
to
everyone
It's
the
sulfur.
Sulfur.
What
were
those
things?
Demons.
-
Scavengers
of
the
damned.
Yeah.
And
I
don't
think
You
really
believe
Isabel?
Never
in
a
million
years.
Well,
let's
be
sure.
Let's
see
if
she's
in
hell.

ANGELA:
In
front
of
the
chair.
ANGELA:
-
These
are
all
Isabel's
things?
-
How
about
the
cat?
Yeah,
why?
Duck.
Oh,
you
think
that's
strange.
Cats
are
good.
Half
in,
half
out
anyway.
If
this
is
some
kind
of
spell
...don't
you
need
candles
Why,
do
you
have
any?
-
This
is
crazy.
I
need
you
to
leave.
-
I'm
sorry?
The
apartment.
Okay.
Be
careful
with
that
cat.

God,
I
hate
this
part.

-
Isabel.

JOHN:

Jesus.
-
Constantine,
what...?
Jesus.
What?
-
You
were
twins.
-
She
killed
herself.
And
she's
damned
for
it.
How
is
this
possible?
I
need
to
eat.

MAN:
Relax,
man.
Slow
down!
What
the
hell
kind
of
place
is
this?

John.



When
I
was
a
kid,
I
could
see
things.
Things
humans
aren't
supposed
to
see.
Things
you
shouldn
't
have
to
see.

My
parents
were
normal.
They
made
it
worse.
You
think
you're
crazy
long
enough...
...you
find
a
way
out.
ANGELA:
You
tried
to
kill
yourself.
Officially,
I
was
dead
for
two
minutes.
But
when
you
cross
over...
...time
stops.
Take
it
from
me,
When
I
came
back...
...I
knew...
...all
the
things
I
could
see
were
real.
Heaven
and
hell
are
right
here.
The
world
behind
the
world,
Angels
and
demons
can't
So
instead
we
get
The

peddlers.
They
can
only
whisper
in
our
ears,
but
...
or
turn
your
favorite
pleasure
Those
with
the
demon
's
touch...
...
like
those
part
angel,
They
call
it
the
balance.
I
call
it
hypocritical
bullshit.
So
when
a
half-breed
...I
deport
their
sorry
ass
I
don't
get
them
all...
...but
I've
been
hoping
to
get
enough
...retirement.
I'm
a
suicide,
Angela.
When
I
die,
the
rules
say
You're
trying
to
buy
your
way
What
would
you
do
...where
half
the
inmates
I
guess
God
has
a
plan
for
all
of
us.
God's
a
kid
with
an
ant
farm,
lady.
He's
not
planning
anything.
When
we
were
little...
...Isabel
saw
things
too.

Hey,
what
the

is

doing
here?
He's
okay.
Why
didn't
you
call
me,

BEEMAN:
What
do
you
mean?
What?
How?
Mm-hm.
Got
it.
Bye.
I
need
to
see
where
Isabel
died.
ANGELA:
Our
father
thought
she
was
She
certainly
did
that.
She'd
tell
everyone
about
the
things
She'd
scare
my
mother
half
to
death.
And
then
she
stopped
talking
JOHN:
ANGELA:

Two
weeks.

time.
She'd
get
better,
and
then
she'd
That
symbol
that
was
cut

it
have
something
to
do
I'm
a
cop,
John,
remember?
You
don't
walk
off
the
roof
of
a
building
And
I
showed
you
everything
Maybe
she
left
something
else.
Something
just
for
you.
You
were
her
twin,
Angela.
-
I'm
not
like
my
sister.
When
you
were
kids.
When
you'd
spend
every
second
You'd
start
a
sentence,
she'd
finish
it.
That
was
a
long
time
ago.
That
kind
of
bond
doesn't
There
is
nothing
here.
-
Hey.
Come
on.
She
thought
it
up
right
here.
She
knew
you'd
come.
She
counted
...feel
what
she
felt,
-
What
did
she
do,
Angela?
-
What
did
she
do,
Angela?
-
What
would
you
do?
What
did
she
do,
Angela?
You
know
You
know
what
she
did.
What
are
-
What
did
she
do?

When
we
were
girls...
...we
would
leave
each
other
messages.
In
light.
In
breath.
On
the
windows.
John,
there
is
no
17th
act
Corinthians
goes
to
21
acts
They
have
Bibles
in
hell.
JOHN:
Says
the
world
will
not
end
...
but
be
reborn
in
the
embrace
Though
if
you
ask
me...
...fire's
fire.
BEEMAN:
Oh,
my,
this
is
certainly
not
good.

No,
the
other

BEEMAN:
This
is
the
sign
of
Mammon...

son
of
the
devil.

JOHN:
Beeman?
Sorry,
I'm...
It
says
Mammon
has
no

yearns
to
forge
his
own
kingdom

Yeah.
Mammon
would
be
...we'd
ever
want

over
No,
wait,
wait,
wait.
I'm
reading.
Always
a
catch.
It
says
first
Mammon
would
have
to

Isabel.
To
cross
over,
Mammon
would
need
To
cross
over,
Mammon
would
need

The

JOHN:
Beeman?
...I
know
you've
never
had
much
faith,
...
but
that
doesn
't
mean

you.

Beeman?
Beeman?
Drive.
Fast.

Beeman!
Sulfur.
JOHN:
Beeman!


Wasn't
just
Isabel.
I
used
to
see
things
too.
But...
-
...you
already
knew
that,
didn't
you?
ANGELA:
You
don't
wanna
know
I'm
stronger
than
Isabel.
Your
sister
embraced
her
gift,
It's
why
you're
still
alive.
I
don't
need
another
ghost
ANGELA:
I'd
trade
places
with
her
if
I
could.
I
used
to
pretend
that
I
didn't.
That
I
didn't
see
things.
And...
...by
the
time
we
were
10,
...antipsychotics...
...and
have
treatments.
...and
she'd
look
at
me,
Why
don't
you
tell
them,
Angie,
But
I
lied.
I
said:
"I
don't
see
anything."
Until
one
day...
...I
finally
stopped
seeing.
I
abandoned
her,
John.
I
left
her
all
alone.
I
need
to
see
what
she
saw.
Please.
You
do
this,
there's
no
turning
back.
You
see
them...
...they
see
you.
Understand?
Yeah.
JOHN:

So
do
I
have
to
take
the
rest
of
John?
I'm
thinking.
John?
On
is
fine.
-
So
why
water?
Lubricates
the
transition
-
Now
ask
me
if
there's
water
in
hell.
Sit.
Normally,
only
a
portion
of
the
body
...you
wanted
the
crash
course.
Yeah,
I
wanted
the
crash
course.
So,
um...
So,
what's
gonna
happen?
Lie
down.
-
What
do
you
mean
lie
down?
For
how
long?
As
long
as
it
takes.
Take
a
deep
one.

Oh,
God.
Oh,
God,
all
those
people.
Oh,
Isabel.
I've
always
known.
I've
always
known
where
they
are.
...where
to
aim
and
where
to
duck...
...and
I've
always
known
I've
always
known
that
it
wasn't
luck.
Always
known
that
it
wasn't
luck.
I've
always
known
that
I
could
see.
I've
always
known
that
I
could
see.
Angela.
Someone
was
here.
It
was
his.
Rolling.
Not
a
ball.
Something
smaller.
Shiny.
Balthazar.

Sorry.
Can
you
just
kill
him?
What
about
the
balance?
Half-breed
tipped
the
scales
I'm
just
adding
some
counterweight.

John,
I
really
want...
Think
of
it
as
a
bulletproof
vest.
Uh-uh.
I'm
coming
with
you.
You're
staying
in
the
car.
Fire?
I
was
born
of
this.
How's
Mammon
crossing
over,
That's
better.
Au
naturel.
"Stay
in
the
car."
"Wait
here."
Men.
Don't
fight
it,
Johnny
boy.
Enjoy
it.

We'll
see
you
very
soon.
Not
really,
no.
You
can't
cheat
it
this
time.
True.
But
you're
not.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Spare
me
your
remedial
incantations.
You
do
know
what
it
is
To
be
welcomed
Demon
in
heaven.
I'd
love
to
be
a
fly
on
that
wall.
You're
not
a
priest.
You
have
no
power.
Just
tell
me
how
Mammon
...and
you
can
go
back
Okay,
Bally,
enjoy
it.

"May
God
have
mercy
on
you
Whose
soever
sins
you
remit
on
Earth,
-
How?
How's
he
doing
it?
No,
I
can't.
Grant
your
child
entry
...in
the
name
of
the
Father
and
the
Son
Amen!

The
blood
of
God.
He
found
it.
Whatever
killed
the
son
of
God...
...will
give
birth
to
the
son
of
the
devil.
By
the
way...
...you
have
to
ask
for
absolution
...asshole.

My
work
here
is
done.
-
What
are
you
laughing
at?
...and
you
brought
her
right
to
us.
So
does
this
walking
fast
Jesus
didn't
die
from
being
nailed
to
a
The
Spear
of
Destiny.
I'm
a
catholic,
John.

BALTHAZAR:
She's
been
made
flush
and
ready.
So
much
power.
Now,
if
you
grant
me
my
resurrection,
Wait.
But
I
did
as
we
agreed.
No.
Please.
No!
Beeman
said
Mammon
needed
How's
the
blood
of
God's
only
son?
ANGELA:
-
Yeah.
He
still
has
to
locate
Not
really.
Twins.
Where's
the
amulet?
I
don't
know,
What's
wrong?
I
don't
know,
I
just
feel...
-
Bird
on
a
ladder.
-
Wait
here.
Who's
a
rat
in
a
dress
now,
huh,
bitch?
Have
you
lost
what
Don't.
I
need
to
use
the
chair.
I
offer
no
aid
to
one
side
or
the
other.
-
The
balance.

You
dare?
In
my
house?
Is
this
neutral?
Bullshit.
You're
the
only
one
still
playing
And
while
you've
been
imitating
Hennessy,
Beeman,
they
were
I
need
your
help!
Consider
it
a
last
request.
You
play
a
dangerous
game.

Two-hundred-dollar
shirt,
by
the
way.
MIDNITE:
...to
climb
out
of
his
father's
shadow
I'd
hate
to
think
what
he
would
do
JOHN:
MIDNITE:
Two
hundred
souls
passed
JOHN:
Which
way's
east?
MIDNITE:
Like
riding
a
bike.
No,
not
really.
Tell
me
this
isn't
about
the
girl.
Definitely
mostly
not
about
the
girl.
JOHN:
Little
flavor?
-
Sure
about
this?
[DEMONIC
VOICE
Midnite!
-
Any
luck?
Holy
shit.
You're
Papa
Midnite,
And
how
exactly
do
you
intend
CHAS:
Half-breeds
are
most
vulnerable...
...when
their
outer
skin
is
breached
Certain
objects,
most
notably
...have
been
used
by
even
...commonly
occurring
waters...
...even
rain.
Maybe
if...
There's
no
use
sitting
on
the
bench
You
wouldn't
have
one
of
those
...maybe
we
could
take
with
us?
Look,
John,
no
offense,
I
just
don't
think
...you
going
on
a
solo
mission
I
don't
know
what
pops
thinks,
Take
him,
John.
Kill
him
after.
If
you
get
back,
see
me
Okay.
I
will.

-
What
are
you
doing?
Praying.
Okay.
Come
on.


CHAS:
A
birth
like
this,
they're
definitely
Yeah.
We
can
get
through
them.
I
mean,
Right?
It's
not
always
like
it
is
in
the
books.
[DEMONIC
VOICE
[DEMONIC
VOICE
CHAS:
Hellspeak.
You
know
what
to
do.
I'm
okay.
Sure.
One
last
show.
Hi.
My
name's
John.
You
are
in
violation
of
the
balance.
Leave
immediately...
...or
I
will
deport
you.
All
of
you.
Go
to
hell.
Holy
water?


MALE
VOICE:
Uh,
John?
John.

Shit.

JOHN:

Angela.
Angela,
what
is
it?

Get
it
out.

ANGELA:
Get
it...

[CHAS
AND
JOHN
Oh,
my
God.
Not
bad,
kid.
"Not
bad."
You
hear
that?
You
know
why
that
is?
It's
because
Chas.
You're
right,
John.
It's
not
like
the
books.
No...
...it
isn't.
Into
the
light,
I
command
thee.
Into
the
light,
I
command
thee.
Into
the
light,
I
command
thee.
Into
the
light,
I
command
thee.
Your
ego
is
astounding.
Gabriel.
Figures.
And
the
wicked
shall
inherit
the
Earth.
You
judging
me
now,
John?
Betrayal,
murder,
genocide,
I
am
simply
seeking
to
inspire
mankind
By
handing
Earth
over
Help
me
here.
You're
handed
this
precious
gift,
right?
Each
one
of
you
granted
redemption
Murderers,
rapists
and
molesters...
...all
of
you,
you
just
have
to
repent...
...and
God
takes
you
into
his
bosom.
In
all
the
worlds
in
all
the
universe...
...no
other
creature
can
make
It's
not
fair.
If
sweet,
sweet
God
loves
you
so...
...then
I'll
make
you
worthy
of
his
love.
I've
been
watching
you
for
a
long
time.
It's
only
in
the
face
of
horror
And
you
can
be
so
noble.
So...
...I'll
bring
you
pain.
I'll
bring
you
horror.
So
that
you
may
rise
above
it.
So
that
those
of
you
who
survive
...will
be
worthy
of
God's
love.
Gabriel...
...you're
insane.
The
road
to
salvation
begins
tonight.
Right
now.
I
know
I'm
not
one
of
your
favorites.
I'm
not
even
welcome
in
your
house.
But
I
could
use
a
little
attention.
Please.
GABRIEL:
Hurry.
GABRIEL:
...son
of
Satan...
...I
unleash
you
unto
this
world.
Hello.
What
took
you
so
long?
SATAN:
John,
hello.
You're
the
one
soul...
...I
would
come
up
here
So
I've
heard.
You
mind?
Oh,
go...
Go
right
ahead.
I've
got
stock.
Coffin
nail.
Very
fitting,
John.
You
know,
when
you
cut
too
deep,
...finger
movement
goes
Let
me
help
you.
See?
Sonny...
...I've
got
a
whole
theme
park
Well,
aren't
you
a
peach.
I
didn't
think
you
would
And
you
didn't...
...did
you?
So
how's
the
family?
Family's
doing
just
fine.
Word
is
that
kid
of
yours
Well,
one
does
what
one
can.
He's
in
the
other
room.
Boys
will
be
boys.
With
Gabriel.
No
accounting
for
taste,
really.
They
have
the
Spear
of
Destiny.
"They
have
the
Spear
of
Destiny."
Or
is
it
another
one
of
your
cons?
Go
look
for
yourself.
You've
waited
20
years
for
me,
Lu...
...what's
another
20
seconds?

-
Lucifer.
You,
best
of
all
of
us,
Gabriel...
...should
understand
ambition.
Son
of
perdition.
Little
horn.
Most
unclean.
I
do
miss
the
old
names.
Time
to
go
home,
son.
I
will
smite
thee...
...in
his
honor.
Looks
like
somebody
doesn't

Father?
So.
So.
Yeah,
what
do
you
want?
An
extension?
The
sister...
...Isabel.
What
about
her?
Let
her
go
home.
You're
willing
to
give
up
your
life
Fine.
It's
done.
Time
to
go,
John.
Yeah.


The
sacrifice.
No.
This
one
belongs
to
me.
No.
You
will
live,
John
Constantine.
You
will
live.
So
you
will
have...

...the
chance
to
prove...
...that
your
soul
truly
belongs
in
hell.
Oh,
you
will
live.
You
will
live.
Thank
you.
No
problem.

JOHN:
You
don't
deserve
to
be
human.
Do
you
want
revenge?
Do
it.
Do
it.
Seek
revenge.
End
my
life.
Go
on.
Be
the
hand
of
God.
It's
your
choice.
It's
always
been
your
choice.
Yeah.
That's
called
pain.
Get
used
to
it.
You
could've
shot
me,
John!
You
chose
a
higher
path!
Look
how
well
you're
doing!
ANGELA:
JOHN:
Something
tells
me
Oh,
how
thoughtful.
John...
...why
are
you
giving
me
this?
Rules.
Hide
it.
Somewhere
no
one
Not
even
me.
Ah.
Always
a
catch.
Yeah.
So.
I've
got
some
cleaning
up
to
do.
I'II...
...see
you
around.
I'd
like
that.
JOHN:
I
had
to
die...
...
twice...
...
just
to
figure
that
out.
Like
the
book
says,
he
works
his
work
Some
people
like
it...
...
some
people
don
't.
You
did
good,
kid.
