He
came
back
again
last
night
He
opened
me
like
a
flower
of
pain...
...and
it
felt
good.
He
sank
into
me
and
set
me
on
fire...
...like
he
always
does.
Made
me
burn
from
the
inside
out.
How
did
you
know
it
was
the
devil?
I
know
what
you're
thinking.
I
know
you
think
...because
you
don't
believe
in
the
devil.
Okay,
let's
talk
about
your
stepfather.
You
know
about
my
stepfather.
I
cut
his
Adam's
apple
in
half...
...like
a
piece
of
fruit
on
a
summer
day...
...so
he
wouldn't
say
a
word.
I
sat
next
to
him
...slowly.
It
was
the
only
way
to
help
him
stop.
Stop
what?
Stop
fucking
me!
You're
not
listening.
I
am
listening,
Chloe.
You're
not
listening
with
your
heart.
Your
brain
is
the
problem.
You
have
no
idea
You've
got
to
trust
me
too,
Chloe.
You
can't
trust
someone
Okay.
I
think
that's
enough
for
today.
But
I
do
think
we
made
...found
out
some
new
things...
Do
you
know
what
it
is
-
Do
you
know?
Because
you
are
dead!
I
am.
I'm
not
touching
her!
Let
me
go!
Let
me
go.
Thank
you.
You're
driving
me
crazy!
Stop!
-
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
I
can
walk
by
myself!
Stand
up!
Look
at
that.
"I'm
a
doctor.
"
"Open
this
door.
"
Get
in.
She's
nuts.
Hey.
Sorry.
I
need
to
cross-reference
some
files
-
Check
with
Anna.
She'll
fit
you
in.
I'm
not
discharging
her,
period.
If
you
want
to
pursue
this,
sir,
Until
then
she's
mine.
Thank
you.
Lawyers.
Hey,
come
on
in.
What's
up?
Chloe.
She's
embellishing
She
says
that
the
devil
-
Okay.
It
has
something
to
do
with
...but
instead
of
assessing
...she
just
falls
into
these
Time.
Give
it
time.
I've
given
it
time.
Time
and
Elavil.
Maybe
they're
just...
...too
medicated.
I
know
we
all
create
our
realities
But
what
she
creates
Chloe's
mind
only
runs
on
one
track.
Well,
right
now,
Come
here.
You
have
a
brilliant
mind.
You'll
figure
it
out.
Throw
it
on
the
mirror.
This
is
what
she
sees
now.
-
A
distorted
image
of
herself.
-
I'm
the
mirror.
If
I'm
the
mirror
and
she's
the
image...
...then
who
are
you?
I
can
see
both
of
you...
...so
I'm
God.
Or
just
an
overworked
hospital
bureaucrat.
"God"
is
good.
Always
remember,
the
ability
to
repress...
...is
actually
a
vital
survival
tool.
...Chloe
might
not
have
survived.
Sorry,
am
I
interrupting
Dr.
Graham.
We
were
just
discussing
Oh,
yeah,
I
had
a
date
last
week.
I'm
sure
your
amorous
adventures
...but
sadly,
I'm
on
my
way
out.
-
Well,
don't
let
me...
I'll
just...
I'm
gonna
run
out
to
Willow
Creek.
I'll
be
here.
See
you
at
dinner.
Keep
an
eye
on
my
wife
for
me,
Pete.
-
No,
thanks.
Smoke
it
tonight
while
it's
fresh.
-
Good
night,
boss.
Why
don't
we
share
one
of
those
-
It
sounds
like
a
great
offer...
...but
I
got
work
to
do.
-
It's
cold
when
it
gets
here.
-
I
hate
pizza.
Come
on,
you
gotta
eat.
Not
with
you.
Come
on,
we're
supposed
to
celebrate.
-
Who's
inside?
-
Why?
What
happened?
-
What'd
you
do,
up
her
meds?
That's
extreme.
I
want
a
copy
of
that
on
my
desk
-
Okay.
Damn
generator.
Not
again.
Irene,
is
that
you?
This
electric
system's
Fourth
time
this
week.
Well,
I'm
gonna
do
my
job,
-
Good
night,
Joe.
Fifty-five,
but
who's
counting?
Oh,
you've
outdone
yourself.
-
Thank
you.
Say
hi
to
your
wife
for
me.
All
that
education
-
Did
you
get
my
note?
Right.
So
how
was
your
date
with...?
With
what's-her-name?
It
was
like
all
She
didn't
respond
to
my
...so
I
started
talking
about
work.
She
said
that
was
not
...and
that
was
it.
I
mean,
we
didn't
even
have
dinner.
She's
not
right.
I
know.
-
I'll
follow
you
down
the
hill.
-
No,
I'm
supposed
to
keep
an
eye
on
you.
Severe
showers
all
over
northern
-
I
know,
I
see
that.
-
flooding
throughout
-
I
can't
let
you
through.
The
road's
closed.
-
I
got
this.
-
Hi,
Bob.
There's
a
sinkhole
up
here,
-
What
should
I
do?
You
know
that
bridge
-
Yeah,
the
little
white
one?
-
Yeah.
-
Okay,
thanks.
Will
do.
-
Doug,
you're
home?
I
got
detoured,
so
I'll
be
home
in
a
few
This
rain
is
slowing
the
work
down.
-
Are
you
okay?
Doug.
Doug!
Are
you
okay?
Are
you
okay?
Hey!
Oh,
my
God.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm
a
doctor.
I'm
gonna
take
you
I'm
gonna
help
you,
okay?
I'm
gonna
help
you,
okay?
Help
me!
Somebody!
Dr.
Graham!
You
better
tell
me
why
I'm
in
here,
Irene.
She
got
up
wild.
-
Bring
your
ass
back
in
here.
-
Get
your
hands
off
me.
-
Keep
her
off.
Keep
her
off
of
me.
Get
off
of
me.
Hold
on.
Calm...
What
are
you
doing?
Thank
you,
nurse.
-
Are
you
okay?
This
is
so
sad.
Miranda,
this
is
very
awkward.
I
suppose
that
technically
...but
I
managed
to
get
the
court
to
grant
us
Anything
we
discuss
...and
won't
go
anywhere
but
this
room.
How
long
have
I
been
in
here?
Three
days.
Why?
Why?
You
were
admitted
to
our
neurosurgical
We
did
scans
and
they
revealed
...severe
frontal-lobe
deficits.
You
received
Haloperidol,
Ativan
injections.
When
you
came
out
of
it,
we
tested.
But
you
were
put
in
restraints
for
a
day
And
then
you
basically
This
is
the
first
time
I've
seen
you
lucid.
I
wanna
talk
to
my
husband.
Where
is
he?
Where
is
he?
You
know,
you're
the
most
You
rely
only
on
the
facts.
So
why
am
I
telling
you
this?
You're
establishing
my
personality.
You
think
I'm
a
rational
person.
And
following
this
pattern
of
analysis,
...a
traumatic
event
which
has
rendered
-
You
think
I'm
in
denial.
...just
focus
on
remembering.
Miranda...
...what's
the
last
thing
you
remember?
I
remember
Chloe.
I
was
having
my
Friday
night
How
did
that
go?
She
was
embellishing
her
rape
story.
-
I
saw
Doug.
You
were
there.
When
I
went
back
to
my
office,
I
decided
to
call
it
quits,
I
went
down
...saw
Joe,
got
my
keys.
-
Yes.
-
There
was
a
detour.
I
had
to
go
over
the
bridge,
I
wonder
what
else
happened.
I
got
home.
I
saw
Doug.
He
was
on
the
couch.
Try
to
remember.
There
was
a
girl.
-
Yeah,
there
was
a
girl.
Yeah,
there
was
a
girl.
-
A
girl
at
the
bridge.
-
There
was
some
kind
of
accident.
-
The
girl
was
bloody.
On
the
bridge...
What's
the
last
thing
you
remember?
Why
are
you
asking
about
Doug?
Was
there
any
trouble
in
your
marriage?
No,
there
was
no
trouble
in
my
marriage.
And
why
are
you
using
Miranda...
...you
don't
remember
anything
Don't
tell
me
something's
I
have
to
tell
you
something.
No,
no,
no...
-
Don't
tell
me
there's
something
with
Doug.
...Doug
is
dead.
You
killed
him.
-
No!
No!
No!
I
didn't.
-
No,
I
didn't.
I
didn't!
I
didn't
do
it!
No!
No!
No!
No,
don't
do
it!
-
It's
okay.
I'm
on
your
side.
I'm
on
your
side.
One
little
bit
more.
Rita.
Let
go.
It's
Dr.
Grey.
Look
it
up.
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.
I'm
the
official
champion
again.
Hello,
Miranda.
Welcome.
You're
one
of
us
now.
You
know
I
don't
belong
here,
Chloe.
If
you're
here,
You
are
not
a
doctor
in
here.
And
even
if
you
tell
the
truth...
...no
one
will
listen.
You
know
why?
Because
you're
crazy.
And
the
more
you
try
...the
crazier
you
appear.
You
are
invisible
now.
Can
you
feel
it?
Don't
touch
me.
Are
you
scared?
No.
You
should
be.
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
dreaming.
Dream
logic,
primary
process,
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
dreaming.
I'm
not
crazy.
I'm
dreaming.
Rise
and
shine,
honey.
It's
a
new
day.
I
wanna
talk
to
Pete.
You'll
see
Dr.
Graham
all
in
good
time,
-
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me,
Irene?
You
don't
want
me
to
get
Jim
Good
girl.
You're
doing
good.
Come
on,
sweetheart,
Come
on,
honey,
You're
a
nut.
Yeah,
it's
you.
You.
Get
away.
Get
away.
What's
your
problem?
What's
your
problem?
I
looked
away
for
a
second.
It's
not
your
fault.
Patients
always
find
a
way
to
hurt
I
never
pegged
her
for
a
cutter,
that's
all.
Neither
did
I.
Shelley
says
Chloe's
...so
I
put
her
in
isolation
for
the
day.
How
is
she?
She's
a
mess.
I
can't
believe
she's
lost
it
so
quickly.
She
cut
herself
35
times,
-
What
was
the
implement?
...though
how
anybody
Hey,
Tony.
We're
fine.
Come
on.
You
think
I
did
this
Did
you?
No.
Well,
I
don't
know.
Who
would
it
be,
then?
Would
it
be...
...Chloe,
or...?
I
don't
know.
By
your
own
admission
...distinguishing
what's
reality
Yeah,
as
a
doctor,
But
something
is
really
happening
to
me.
What
about
this
moment,
right
now?
What
about
it?
Is
this
a
hallucination?
Is
it?
I
suggest
that
we
simply
...until
things
make
sense.
Or
maybe
until
I
can
get
myself
Pardon?
Since
I'm
hallucinating
...you
can
help
me
with
something.
Yeah.
Inhale.
Did
we
have
an
affair?
No.
Did
you
want
to?
Yes.
Did
you
think
I
wanted
to?
Yes.
Then
why
didn't
we?
Because
you
were
married
to
the
boss.
But
I'm
not
now.
I'm
here...
I'm...
I'm
trying
to
help
you.
Why
don't
you
trust
me?
Because
you
can't
trust
somebody
Phil.
Hello,
Miranda.
I
need
to
talk
to
you
for
a
minute.
This
is
about
Pete.
What
about
him,
Miranda?
I
don't
think
he's
the
best
doctor
Is
your
complaint
about
him
Pete's
the
best
doctor
And
he
has
my
full
support.
Now,
if
you'll
excuse
me,
Miranda.
-
Miranda.
-
How
are
they
treating
you?
-
They
think
I
did
it,
but
I
didn't
do
it.
-
I
didn't
do
it,
Teddy.
Let's
not...
Let's
not
talk
about
what
you
did
What's
important
is
what
Now,
the
DA
is
pushing
for
a
hearing
Next
week?
We
haven't
even
We
can't
have
a
hearing
next
week.
As
your
attorney,
I
gotta
tell
you
You've
been
placed
at
the
scene.
The
neighbors
heard
the
screams.
They've
got
the
murder
weapon
Your
prints
are
on
the
floor,
Yeah,
but
what's
my
motive?
Why
would
I
do
that?
Has
anybody
checked
the
files?
That
person
would
have
a
motive.
-
Maybe
I
went
into
shock.
The
only
shot
we
have
And
I
don't
even
know
if
that's
gonna
work.
That
will
make
jurors
think
...she
could
probably
fake
insanity
I'm
not
crazy.
-
That's
the
point.
...I'm
the
only
one
around
here
Do
you
think
I'm
crazy?
That's
all
right.
Forget
it.
Forget
it.
Sheriff
Ryan
is
here.
He'd
like
to
talk
to
you.
You
know
he
was
Doug's
best
friend,
It's
fine,
Teddy.
Five
minutes.
Hi,
Bob.
Miranda.
I
just
have
a
few
questions
When
you
first
came
in
...the
way
we
reconstruct
the
crime
is
that
Which
means
he
must
have
seen
it
coming.
And
what
we
don't
understand
is
how
he...
-
Why
did
you
do
it?
How
could
you
kill
Doug
like
that?
-
That's
the
only
question
I
need
answered.
I
don't
have
any
answers
You
don't?
You
better
start
thinking
of
some
-
Sheriff,
that's
enough.
That's
enough!
I
need
her
to
tell
me
why
she
did
it.
Okay,
we're
done.
Enough!
Let's
kill
your
friend,
see
how
you
feel!
-
You
said
no
shock
treatment.
-
Stop
it.
Why
would
you
take
these
out?
Don't
look
at
them.
I
had
to
pick
him
up
off
the
floor,
Miranda.
Miranda,
what's
that?
It's
okay.
It's
okay,
Miranda.
-
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
-
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
-
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
Come
in,
Miranda.
Please,
take
a
seat.
So...
You
wanted
to
see
me.
I
was
there.
I
was
there
when
Doug
was
killed.
But
I
wasn't
alone.
I
wasn't
there
alone,
-
Who
was
there
with
you?
I
don't
know.
I
don't
know
who
it
was.
But
somebody
else
was
there.
Miranda.
We
know
you
have
no
family
left.
We
are
your
family
now.
I
know.
I
know
you...
I
want
you
to
know
that
we're
gonna
...to
help
you
and
to
make
you
feel
secure.
And
to
make
you
feel
But
there's
a
hearing
scheduled.
-
Miranda.
Sit
down.
Miranda.
Who
is
this
girl?
-
Put
the
picture
back.
That's
my
daughter,
Rachel.
No,
this
is
the
girl
I
saw
at
the
bridge.
-
No.
-
It's
impossible.
This
girl,
right
here.
She's
dead.
Rachel
died
four
years
ago.
I'm
a
rational
person.
I
believe
in
science.
I
don't
believe
in
the
paranormal.
And
I
don't
believe
in
ghosts.
But
if
you
are
the
ghost
of
Rachel
Parsons...
...then
you
would
let
me
out
of
this
cell.
Bob,
you
leave
this?
Shit.
Pete's
office.
Chloe.
Chloe!
Help
me!
Let
me
go!
Let
me
go!
Check
Chloe!
Check
Chloe!
-
Did
you
talk
to
Chloe?
-
Was
she
raped?
-
Why?
Did
I...?
She
was
checked.
-
He
didn't
have
time.
-
What
about
her
face?
She
had
a
cut.
I
saw
a
tattoo.
Did
she
talk
about
a
tattoo?
-
Why
don't
you
sit
down.
A
tattoo?
A
woman
in
flames,
hands
up
like
this:
Like
a
Biblical
image.
The
Anima
Sola?
-
Yeah,
the
Anima
Sola.
That's
what
I
saw.
I
mean,
it's
the
woman
in
chains,
I'm
talking
about
something
I
saw
-
That's
what
I
saw.
This
image
is
tailor-made
A
woman
in
purgatory.
I
need
you
to
explain
this
to
me,
though.
-
Rachel
Parsons
did
not
commit
suicide.
-
When
I
saw
her...
-
She
was
cut
up.
-
Yes,
I
saw
her.
Someone
did
that
to
her!
-
Let's
reopen
the
case.
-
I
saw
her.
And
she's
connected
to
me.
-
How,
I
don't
know.
Don't
rattle
off
your
psychiatric
shit!
Good.
Saves
me
the
trouble.
Glass
cells
are
having
electrical
problems.
I'm
gonna
transfer
you
to
a
Psych
Ward
cell.
One
strike,
you're
going
to
solitary.
Don't
screw
up.
Rachel
Parsons
was
there.
Dead
or
alive,
I
don't
know.
That
girl
came
to
me.
She
came
to
me.
Hi,
Chloe.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
believe
you.
I
need
you
to
tell
me
who
did
this
to
you.
Tell
me
his
name,
Chloe.
Chloe,
tell
me.
I'll
tell
you
one
thing:
He
can
have
my
body...
...but
he
will
never
have
my
soul.
Never.
The
devil.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
He
said
you're
next.
-
Try
to
stay
awake.
If
you
need
me,
I'll
be
in
the
coffee
room.
Lights
out.
Leave
me
alone!
-
Doesn't
even
look
like
a
real
ant.
-
'50s
B
movies,
man.
Hey,
what
is
that?
It's
Dr.
Grey.
Level
C,
we've
got
suicidal
behavior
Open
it!
Dr.
Grey's
in
trouble!
Number
33,
open
it
now!
Oh,
damn.
-
Hold
her,
I'll
medicate
her.
Don't
argue
with
me.
Jesus!
Easy,
easy.
Stop
her!
She's
got
my
keys,
stop
her!
Shit!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
Hey!
We
got
a
runner!
Inmate
escaping!
-
Stay
with
me.
She's
gone
this
way.
Let's
go!
Clear!
Split
up!
Keep
moving!
She's
going
up
the
North
Tower!
Shit!
Shit!
Hey!
It's
already
open!
She's
on
the
upper
level!
Hold
it
right
there!
-
Dr.
Grey!
Go!
Go!
Go
the
other
way!
Circle
back.
Come
on,
Hank.
Don't
think
she
made
it
Yeah,
but
even
so,
Hide-and-seek.
The
longer
it
lasts,
-
You
should
be
a
professor.
Let's
go.
I
don't
think
she's
in
here.
I
got
it.
Is
it
clear
there?
We
checked
corridors
Four
and
Five.
-
It's
cool.
We're
headed
to
Six
and
Seven.
-
What's
going
on
down
there?
What
do
you
mean,
what
do
I
mean?
Look,
this
is
the
fourth
time
this
month
-
Ye...
Thank
you.
-
Took
long
enough.
Hey,
Joe.
You
see
something?
Yeah,
just
now
when
the
monitors
came
on.
Corridor
Six,
something
flashed
Frank,
East
Wing.
Don,
take
the
West.
Here,
take
my
car.
Go.
Go.
Go
on.
What
do
you
want
from
me?!
Okay.
Now
what?
Miranda,
no!
Doug?
No.
No,
Miranda,
no.
Miranda,
don't!
No,
don't,
please!
Please!
No!
Miranda,
no!
Please!
Don't
do
this
to
me!
No!
Don't!
No!
Miranda,
no,
wait!
Don't
do
this
to
me,
please,
Miranda!
Miranda,
no!
Don't!
No!
Don't
do
this
to
me,
Miranda!
I
love
you.
What
did
I
do?
Why?
Why?
Why
me?
Why?
Why?
Willow
Creek.
How
was
Willow
Creek?
This
rain
is
slowing
the
work
down.
I'll
see
you
in
a
couple
of
days.
It's
good
to
be
God.
I
love
you.
-
Drop
the
knife!
Put
it
on
the
ground
now!
-
Drop
the
gun!
-
You
drop
it!
What?
Help
me,
please!
Help!
Carter,
get
down
here
now!
Help
me,
please!
Please!
All
I
can
tell
you
is
that
the
girl
She
was
reported
missing
two
weeks
ago.
She
was
found
this
morning
...at
a
farm
belonging
to
Dr.
Douglas
Grey.
Can
she
speak?
-
We
can't
comment
on
that.
We
can't
confirm
that.
Excuse
me.
Sheriff,
is
the
FBI
taking
over
Why
don't
you
ask
the
goddamn
FBI?
We
need
her
at
the
hospital
Consider
house
arrest
pending
trial,
Last
night,
your
client
dropped
a
guard...
...assaulted
a
nurse,
escaped
from
And
saved
a
girl's
life.
-
How
did
she
know
she
was
there?
-
But
the
point
is...
Come
here.
The
FBI
says
there
could
be
more
victims.
There
were
needles
down
there,
Once
the
press
gets
ahold
of
it,
Now,
I
need
some
answers,
So
your
client
isn't
going
anywhere
I
need
to
talk
to
her.
It's
hard
to
believe
We
worked
together
a
long
time.
How
could
I
be
so
blind?
Well,
you
weren't
the
only
one,
Phil.
Do
you
think
my
daughter
could
Yes.
That's
what
"not
alone"
means.
Rachel
was
trying
to
tell
me
that
And
all
this
time...
...we
thought
our
baby
You
see...
...even
after
she
was
gone...
Well...
What?
I
had
this
recurring
dream
about
her.
Eventually
I
took
medication
What
kind
of
dream?
She
was
burning
in
flames,
I
couldn't
save
her.
I
saw
her
exactly
the
same
way,
What
does
that
mean?
Miranda,
I...
I...
I
wouldn't
look
for
It's
a
dream,
a
delusion.
A
delusion
that
we
both
seem
to
share.
-
Yeah.
I
was
just
talking
to
Parsons.
I've
been
wrong
about
It's
finally
clear
to
me.
The
man
raping
women
in
prison
It
goes
back
to
the
Anima
Sola
tattoo.
Miranda,
you
have
to
stop
doing
this.
Every
time
people
start
taking
you
seriously,
I'm
not
deluded,
Pete,
I'm
possessed.
I
don't
believe
in
ghosts.
Neither
do
I,
but
they
believe
in
me.
Great,
just
great.
Let's
go.
Come
on.
I
need
to
talk
to
Sheriff
Ryan.
He's
working
with
the
FBI
team.
It's
really
important.
I'll
leave
him
a
message.
Thank
you.
Screw
it.
I
got
a
message
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me?
Yeah,
Bob.
I
wanna
talk
to
you.
Because
the
last
time,
all
you
wanted
to
do
-
Is
this
what
you
wanna
talk
to
me
about?
They're
a
little
different
now,
right?
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
happens
to
a
-
Lf
you
know
anything,
anything...
What?
Not
alone.
I
know
what
it
means.
There
are
two
killers.
Parsons
and
I
both
saw
a
girl
Then
I
saw
Chloe
being
raped
by
a
man
A
woman
burning
in
flames.
Get
it?
Okay,
it's
crazy.
I
know
it
sounds
crazy.
-
You
told
Pete?
When?
Yes.
This
afternoon.
Why?
I
don't
think
you're
crazy
at
all.
-
You
actually
saw
this
tattoo?
I've
heard
of
serial
killers
Classic
mentor
and
disciple
syndrome.
So
we're
looking
for
the
disciple?
-
I
don't
know.
What
kind
of
guy
would
this
have
to
be?
Okay.
He
would
have
to
be
someone
...that
had
an
absent
father.
He
developed...
...an
obsessive,
over-dependent
...which
then
turned
into
some
He
probably
even
got
off
And
as
a
man
he
is
totally
confused
That's
who
he
is.
Man,
that's
screwed
up.
But
a
guy
like
that
could
seem
Yeah,
they
usually
do.
Yeah.
Look,
Miranda,
I
don't
wanna
scare
you...
...but
if
there
is
a
second
killer
out
there,
You're
a
big
threat
to
this
guy.
I
don't
know
anything
else.
You
saw
the
tattoo,
Yeah,
but
I
found
all
that
by
instinct.
This
guy
is
facing
the
electric
chair.
He
doesn't
have
the
luxury
He's
gotta
believe
that
Doug
But
he
didn't
confess.
Maybe
he
didn't
spill
it
out
loud,
but...
Well,
you
know,
you're
a
psychiatrist.
There's
a
lot
of
ways
to
confess.
I'm
just
trying
to
put
myself
Then
why
didn't
he
go
back
-
Take
care
of
the
girl,
clean
up
evidence?
Well,
that's
how
you
get
caught.
Better
to
let
the
dust
settle.
But
about
you...
...he's
desperate.
Desperate
enough
to...
...talk
to
me?
Well,
you're
right.
I
do
fit
the
profile.
Longtime
friend
of
Doug's,
I
never
did
get
a
kick
out
of
Stop
it!
-
No!
-
You
can't
kill
me!
After
this
kicks
in,
I'm
gonna
have
a
lot
Help!
Miranda!
Damn
it!
Help
me!
Help!
Help
me!
Okay.
You
tried
to
escape,
Miranda.
That
means
I
can
do
Rachel
wasn't
the
first,
you
know.
Doug
killed
a
girl
when
he
was
I
helped
him
bury
the
body.
What
are
best
friends
for?
We
got
older.
But
I
gotta
tell
you...
...you
never
lose
your
taste
Then
we
stopped
for
a
long
time.
But
then
Dougie
saw
sweet
Rachel
and...
That
was
an
itch
way
too
deep
And
then
we
had
the
time
of
our
lives
Everything
was
perfect.
Those
girls
would
do
anything.
We
were
their
god.
Until
you...
Miranda!
You
and
I
both
know
So
let's
be
logical...
...and
end
this
thing.
Thank
you,
Miranda.
Rachel?
This
isn't
logical.
You're
already
dead!
Logic
is
overrated.
I'm
sorry,
Miranda.
So
it's
been
almost
a
year
Sometimes
I
wake
up
screaming.
That's
normal.
No,
not
these
dreams.
Everyone
thought
you
and
I
were
crazy...
...but
we
were
seeing
the
truth.
More
than
they
could
see.
Once
you
open
the
door,
Not
true.
I
closed
it.
Then
I
locked
it...
...and
then
I
threw
away
the
key.
I
really
hope
that's
true.
You
know,
my
train
leaves
in
half
an
hour.
Okay.
I'll
get
you
on
your
way.
So
good
luck
with
your
job,
okay?
I
wanted
to
thank
you
for
what
you
did.
You
really
helped
me.
You
helped
me.
You
taught
me
how
to
listen.
Thank
you.
We
made
it.
No!
