What

I

that
place.
JILL:
What
happened?
-
Thanks.
I
lost
a
patient
today.
Mr.
Talcott.
-
L"m
sorry.
The
second
he
died,
it
was
like...
they
couldn"t
wait
to
get
him
out
of
there.
It"s
just
a
business
to
them.
It
is
a
business,
but
at

he
had

No.
It"s
supposed

Oh,

Hello?
Hello?



LUKE:
Now

right
there
Old-fashioned
devotion,
You
must
be
Caroline.
L"m
sorry,
the
door
was
open,
Oh,
no.
It"s
a
big
house.
I
didn"t
hear
you.
LUKE:
It"s
okay.
So
much
for
getting
their
affairs
in
order.
L"m
sorry.
L"m
Luke
Marshall.

We
talked

Oh,

The

CAROLINE:
I
understand.
His
wife"s

kind
of
Most
people
do.
LUKE:
Violet,
you
have
a
visitor.
May
I
present
Miss
Caroline
Ellis?
She
works
down
at
the
hospice
Caroline,
this
is
Violet
Devereaux.
You
have
a
lovely
home.
L"m
sorry.
It"s
just
hard.
I
understand,
really.
She"s
Old
South,
you
know.
So,
he
can"t
talk
at
all?
No.
Stroke
pretty
much
paralysed
him.
-
Which
side
was
affected?
It
happened
about
a
month
ago,
That"s
where
she
found
him.
Ben?
You
have
a
visitor.
Meet
Miss
Caroline
Ellis.
Hello,
Ben.
L"m
Caroline.
VIOLET:
She"s
not
from
around
here.
She"s
from
New
Orleans.
She
wasn"t
raised
in
New
Orleans.
VIOLET:
Who
knows
where
she
comes
from?
What
do
you
want
a
Southern
accent?
The
last
one
left,
Violet.
All
right.
But
she"s
not
going
to
understand
the
house.
The
last
girl
left,
huh?
LUKE:
Wait.
Let
me
talk
to
her,
I
can"t
help
anybody
She
does
want
help.
She"s
just
scared.
Of
what?
Politeness?
No.
He"s
the
love
of
her
life
and
he"s
dying.
They"ve
been
together
forever.
She"s
losing
her
soul
mate
here.
I
don"t
know
about
you,
but
that"d
Aren"t
you
a
romantic?
Look.
The
last
girl
quit.
You"re
the
fifth
interview
since.

It"s
not
personal.
But
you
being
here
means
he"s
really
dying.
He"s
dying
whether
l"m
here
or
not.
What"d
she
mean
about
the
house?
What?
She
said
I
wouldn"t
understand
All
I
know
is
her
cheques
clear.
Look,
forget
it.
If
it
makes
you
feel
any
better,
l"m
All
right.
So
if
you
talked
to
her,
what
would
you
say?
L"d
say
she
could
look
all
she
wants...
but
I
doubt
she"d
find
any
better
than
you.
So
she"d
do
well
to
treat
you
like
it.
Okay,
here
are
my
rules.
No
knitting.
No
joining
a
bridge
club.
And
no
playing
bingo.
Okay,
good.
Good
rules.
L"m
serious,
they"II
try
and
suck
It"s
less
than
an
hour
away.
Yeah,
well,
you
better.
Whenever
you
want
to
talk
to
someone
Jeez,
what
is
it
with
you
and
old
people?
Come
here.
He"d
be
proud
of
you.
You
know
he
would.
Hello?
I
need
to
pay
for
some
gas.

Hello?



Is
somebody
back
there?
L"m
sorry.
Excuse
me.
I
just
need
to
pay
for
some
gas.


CAROLINE:
Jesus.


$17
for
the
gas.
CAROLINE:
Keep
the
change.
Mrs.
Devereaux?
L"m
unpacked.

Hi,
Ben.
Remember
me?
L"m
Caroline.
L"II
be
taking
care
of
you
for
a
while.
There"s
not
a
lot
of
light
in
here
So
you"re
a
fan
of
the
blues,
huh?
You
have
to
let
go.
Ben,
you"re
hurting
me.
Ouch.
VIOLET:
There
you
are.
Time
for
his
remedies.
Scoot
over,
child.
9:00
in
the
morning
and
7:00
at
night.
He
takes
his
pills
in
powder
form.
Be
sure
he
drinks
it
all
down.
CAROLINE:
What"s
he
taking?
He
gets
the
tremors
sometimes.
And
a
kiss
to
make
it
taste
better.
You"re
scrawnier
than
l"d
hoped.
I
bet
you"re
all
marked
up,
aren"t
you?
-
Marked
up?
I
know
you
young
people
are
always...
jabbing
yourselves
with
ink
and
needles.
You"re
written
on,
aren"t
you?
Not
where
you
can
see.
Well.
He"s
to
be
bathed
daily,
his
linens
changed.
Don"t
bother
with
the
housework.
How
long
have
you
two
lived
here?
Let"s
see.
We
came
over
from
Savannah
in
"62.
We
bought
this
house
They"d
inherited
it
a
long
time
ago,
Lived
here
since
they
were
children.
VIOLET:
There
they
are.
Martin
and
Grace.
VIOLET:
Charming
people.
But
they
fell
on
hard
times,
had
to
sell.
You
keep
their
picture?
Yes.
I
like
to
pay
my
respects
All
right.
Come
along
now.
This
is
the
dining
room.
We
only
use
about
half
of
the
rooms.
The
others
are
for
Ben"s
antique
business.
What
he
couldn"t
sell,
we
stored
here.
Except
for
the
attic.
That
has
crystal
and
china.
And
I
keep
a
very
close
account
There
are
more
than
30
rooms
in
all.
In
the
old
days,
they
made
For
the
owner,
they
made
a
skeleton
key.
This
will
open
every
door.
This
one
is
yours.
I
have
mine.
Now,
the
pantry"s
right
out
here.
You
know,
we
may
have
to
ask
you
Was
there
a
mirror
here
once?
I
noticed
in
the
bathrooms
also
Child,
when
you
get
as
worn-out
you
don"t
need
any
reminding.
If
you
want
a
small
one
that"s
fine
with
me.
-
What"d
you
do
with
them?
VIOLET:
The
boy
tells
me
you
don"t
smoke.
I
do
smoke.
I
smoke
a
lot
I
trust
that
won"t
be
an
issue.
It
won"t
be.
Good.
Then
for
the
most
part
l"II
live
here
as
if
you"re
not
in
residence.
After
all,
we"re
not
kin.
My
mom
left
when
I
was
little.
My
Oh,
my.
So
you
cared
for
him
as
well?
I
would
have.
I
just
thought
I
had
more
time.
Yeah.
You
think
too
much
about
the
time
you
don"t
spend
it
living.
Be
good
to
my
husband.
Remedies
at
9:00.
One,
two,
three.
You
don"t
see
gardens
like
this
Actually,
it"s
the
Garden
State.

I
doubt
that
very
much.
Nothing
more
glorious
than
a
garden.
Gone
every
winter,
back
every
spring.
You
religious
at
all?
I
try
to
keep
an
open
mind.
That"s
good.
That"s
very
good.
Where
are
my
trilliums?
Oh,
fiddlesticks.
Do
me
a
blessing,
child.
Will
you
run
up
to
the
attic
for
me?
I
have
some
seed
packets
in
a
box



What
took
you?
L"m
sorry.
I
thought
the
key
opens
everything.
The
key?
What
key?
The
key
you
gave
me
for
the
house.
There"s
a
door
in
the
attic
Oh,
no,
the
attic,
it"s
never
opened
that.
-
I
got
my
Dixie-Johns.
-
What"s
in
there?
It"s
been
shut
ever
since
we
moved
in.
I
have
to
get
these
in
the
ground,
Mrs.
Devereaux...
Ben
was
in
the
attic,
wasn"t
he,
What
was
he
doing
in
there?
You"II
have
to
ask
him,
child.
Be
a
dear
and
go
see
to
him,
won"t
you?
I
wonder
if
he
wouldn"t
like
some
iced
tea.






His
door
was
locked.
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Stop
right
there,
Ben!
Don"t
move!
Stop!
Ben!
Mrs.
Devereaux!
Ben!
Ben,
what
are
you
doing?
It"s
me!

Mother
of
mercy,
what"s
he
done?
He
got
out
of
the
window.
I
thought
VIOLET:
He"s
having
spasms.
-
Didn"t
you
give
him
his
remedies?
Did
you
make
sure
he
drank
them
down?
I
thought
so.
-
Ben,
what"d
they
make
you
do?
Just
go
get
the
wheelchair.
What
about
a
doctor?
In
the
morning,
VIOLET:
Caroline!
VIOLET:
Caroline!
What
in
damnation
took
you
so
long?
I
came
as
fast
as
I
could.
We"re
just
going
to
have
to
double
his
Caroline,
help
me
here.
Help
me
get
him.
Come
on.
That"s
it.
Where
did
you
think
you
were
going?
You"re
here
two
days
and
Must
have
some
kind
of
One
of
my
many
charms.
So,
what
exactly
happened?
she"s
up
with
the
doc,
says
he
fell?
He
did
fall.
Like
what,
from
his
wheelchair?
You
cannot
be
serious.
From
How?
He
can"t
even
walk.
Please
don"t
tell
me
you"re
quitting.
Will
you
shut
the
door?
You
know
what
my
mama
used
to
say?
If
a
lady
invites
you
into
her
room,
Homespun
Southern

I
found
this
in
Ben"s
room...
last
night.
LUKE:
Found
what?
His
laundry?
No,
it
had
a...
CAROLINE:
There
was...
There
was
a...
It
had
a...
Forget
it.
I
thought
it...
I
don"t
know
what
I
thought.
I
admire
you.
You
know,
what
you
do.
Hell,
I
wouldn"t
be
able
You"d
regret
it.
CAROLINE:
I
quit
college
to
help
out
Out
all
night,
always
on
the
road.
My
father
thought
So
we
didn"t
talk,
didn"t
visit.
Stubborn
and
proud,
You
mean...
Yeah.
He
was
gone
before
I
guess
he
wanted
to
spare
me
from
all
this.
Is
that
so
wrong?
No
one
should
have
to
die
alone.
So
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
tell
me.
About
Ben.
Do
you
ever
feel
like...
he"s
asking
you
for
help?
-
Asking
me?
a
touch.
VIOLET:
Mr.
Marshall?
Where
in
damnation
is
that
boy?
Caroline...
have
you
seen
Mr...
Well...
I
see
the
children
are
getting
acquainted.
Now,
Violet...
you
know
you"re
the
only

I
know
no
such
things,
The

L"m

Are
you
interested?
Caroline?
"Sacrifice."
Are
you
in
the

Caroline?
You"re
forgetful,
child.

It

Take

Walk

Save

Please,

Break

Take

Just

local

How
about
you
buy
me
a
drink?

Whatever
it
is,
it"s
not
your
average
attic.
She
says
it"s
been
locked
up
You
found
yourself
a
hoodoo
room.
-
A
what?
It"s
like
voodoo,
right?
Wrong.
Voodoo"s
a
religion.
Slaves
brought
it
to
Haiti
from
Africa.
You
worship
God,
heaven
and
hell.
-
How"s
hoodoo
different?
American
folk
magic.
-
Magic?
It"s
part
African,
part
European,
And
New
Orleans
is
its
home.
My
Aunt
Nola"s
into
it.
Look,
you
said
the
house
-
Hoodoo
is
pretty
harmless.
It"s
psychological,
like
a
lot
of
that
stuff.
It
can"t
hurt
you
if
you
don"t
believe.
So
this
place
your
aunt
shops
at...
Ever
seen
it?
It"s
either
this
street
or
the
next
one...
or
the
next
one.
JILL:
There.
There?
That"s
a
Laundromat.
Look,
that"s
all
I
know.
So
you
coming
in
or
what?
L"m
not.
I
thought
you
don"t
believe
in
this
stuff.
I
don"t.
But
l"m
not
just
going
So,
you
want
to
go
in,
go
ahead.
You"re
scared.
-
Jill
the
Thrill
is
scared.
You"re
never
going
to
live
this
down.
l"m
not
scared.
VIOLET:
Good
night,
Caroline.
Good
night.

I
told
you
about
the
mirrors.
I
don"t
understand.
This
is
not
your
house.
I
found
them.
I
told
you,
and
you
heard
me.
No
mirrors.
No
mirrors!
L"ve
seen
the
room.
-
What
room?
It"s
not
locked
anymore.
No,
child,
you
don"t
know
You"re
going
to
tell
me
right
now.
Or
l"m
leaving.
You"re
not
from
the
South.
You
won"t
understand.
That
room
up
there,
throw
things
out
of
a
room
like
that.
You
leave
them
just
where
you
found
them.
The
house
is
theirs
just
as
much
as
ours.
The
house
is
whose?
All
right.
About
90
years
ago...
there
was
a
banker
here,
He
made
his
fortune
cheating
the
poor.
He
was
a
mean
man.
He
was
a
cruel
man.
It
was
him,
and
his
family,
name
of
Mama
Cecile
and
Papa
Justify.
Sit
down.
Now...
the
way
I
heard
it,
old
man
Thorpe,

Papa
Justify
was
He
was
a

But
old
Thorpe,
he
just
saw
them
as

And
he
worked
them
to
the
bone.
He
abused
them.
Until
one
night,
as
the
story
goes...
there
was
a
party.
VIOLET:
It
was
the
bank"s
anntversary,
Poltttctans,
sugar
barons,
rtverboat
tycoons.
There
was
a
lot
of
drtnktng
and
danctng...
and
a
couple
of
trysts,
l"m
sure.
And
then,
ftnally,

Terrible.

What

The

Now

That"s

She

Spooky,

Ouch.
Hold

L"II

She
says

CYNTHIA:
You

CUSTOMER:
L"m

CUSTOMER:
Are
you
sure
that
I
can
do
it?
CYNTHIA:
I
know
it
will.
It
will
work.
Just
do
as
I
say.
Don"t
be
afraid.
It
will
work,
and
it
won"t
happen
again,
ever.
Don"t
worry
about
it.
He
won"t
hit
you
again.
Just
use
this
potion
I
mixed
up.
And
you
use
it
as
I
told
you.
-
Okay,
l"II
trust
you,
Mama.
That
brick
dust
at
the
door,
You
lay
a
line
down.
Nobody
that
means
you
harm
can
cross
it.
It"s
how
you
tell
who
your
enemies
are.
It"s
like
hypnotism,
right?
Suggestion?
And
when
this
stuff
works,
it"s
And
if
you
thought,
you
know...
magic
made
you
sick...
you
might
believe
in
a
magic
cure,
right?
Even
though
it"s
all
in
your
head.
Somebody
been
working
roots
on
you.
Say
I
knew
someone
-
Crossed.
Would
he
believe
he
could
be
uncrossed?
What"s
the
nature
of
his
condition?
He
can"t
speak.
Barely
moves.
but
he
seems
to
think
And
you
want
to
know
Yes.
JILL:
You
went

Are
you
out

Come

Haven"t
you
ever
heard
Yeah.
But
this
is
not
that.
How
much

What
recovery?
This
is
hospice.
You"re
just
supposed
to
help
this
guy
die.
He
believes
in
this
stuff.
So
what?
Who
is
he
to
you?
Forget
it.
No,
you
forget
it.
He"s
not
your
dad.
Not
this
one,
the
last,
or
the
one
before.
Why
are
the
two
of
you
so
attached?
L"m
sorry,
Cary.
Just
so
you
know,
l"m
abandoning
him.
Attached
is
better.
I
know.
Cary,
l"m
sorry.
Okay?
But
would
you
look
at
yourself?
You
want
to
be
a

and

It"s
not

It"s

You

This
is
different.
Local
colour.
You
said
yourself
Well,
now
l"m
worried
about
you.
Are
you
a
nurse
or
a
detective?
When
did
you
first
meet
the
Devereauxs?
Just
before
he
had
his
stroke.
They
were
looking
for
a
lawyer
Did
you
ever
think
that
was
going
to
happen
to
him?
How?
Like
tarot
cards
in
the

I
want
to
know

be

room...
but

She
did.
-
Do
you
believe
that?
But
I
heard
it
can"t
hurt
you.
I
mean,
it
can"t
hurt
you
if
you
don"t
believe.
Then
I
suggest
you
leave
that
house
LUKE:
For
God"s
sake,
this
is
insane.
CAROLINE:
That
isn"t
what
he
thinks.
And
you"re
going

take
him
away

How
can
you

The
point
is,
he
does.
Stop

Stop

Hoodoo.

See
the

hanging?
This
stuff"s
got
a
hold
on

out
here.
Yeah,
but
it"s
not

It
doesn"t
matter
if
it"s
not

What"s
wrong?
This
music.
I
know

You

Mrs.

this,
and

Did
you
want
to
see
me?
Yeah,
I
was
wondering
if
There"s
a
leak
up
here.
They"re
all
over
the
house.
Yes,
but
if
you
look
up
close...
Come
on
in.
I
could
show
it
to
you
better.
Actually,
I
have
supper
on
the

I
shouldn"t
leave
it.

It"II

a

You
want

All

Could
you
come
into

So
I
can
show
you
what

You"re
a

one,
Caroline.
L"II

And,
Caroline?
After
you"ve
given
Mr.

you

Would
you
like
sugar
for
your

No,
I
don"t

sugar

But
I
thought
you
liked
it.
You
always
have
sugar
in
your

You
think
l"m
senile,
don"t
you?
Ghosts
in
the

Spells
on
my

I
just
don"t
understand.
These
ghosts,
why
would
they
put
L"ve
been
in
that
room,
too.
Maybe
because
you
don"t

So,
was
that
the
storm
or
the
ghosts?
Well,
say
what
you
will
about
spirits.
L"ve
always
wondered
we
could
learn
from
them.
Like
a
spell?
I
have
great
respect
for
your

And
whatever
he
thinks
What
did
happen
to
him,
Violet?
You
haven"t
touched
your
gumbo.
What
have
you
done
to

I
made
that
special
for

you,
child.
Cecile?
You
all
right?
L"m
fine
now,
Justify.
A
fair
bit
harder
than
the
lawyer,
It"s
harder
every
time.
They
just
don"t
believe
like
they
used
to.
Got
to
get
them
riled
up.
I
told
you
I
wanted
a
black
one
this
time.
You
know
the
black
ones
never
stay.
Beggars
can"t
be
choosers.
I
think
it
fits
you
beautifully.
It"s
better
than
Violet,
or
Grace,
even.
We"II
get
used
to
it.
We
always
do.

The
thing
folks
don"t
understand
VIOLET:
Get
me
out
of
here.
...sometimes
it"s
more
of
a
trade.
Get
me
out
of
here.
No!
There,
there,
Caroline.
CAROLINE:
We
thought
it
was
just
a
fall,
but
Like
a
stroke
or
something.
JILL:
Cary?
CAROLINE:
Dearie
me.
You
called
me.
I
called
you?
For
help.
Don"t
you
remember?
Cary"s
not
herself
right
now.
-
Devereauxs"
lawyer.
Jill,
yes,
I
did
call
you.
Fiddlesticks.
It"s
all
right.
L"m
here.
They
need
real
care
now.
They
can"t
stay
here.
This
is
all
my
fault.
No,
Cary.
No,
it"s
not.
It"s
not.
Someone
should
ride
Jill,
would
you
mind?
And
we"II
meet
you.
Of
course.
Whatever
you
need.
She
meant
so
much
to
them,
her
being
here.
I
know
it
wasn"t
for
long,
but...
they
really
loved
her.
Why
do
you
say
that?
It"s
in
their
wills.
They
left
her
the
house.
