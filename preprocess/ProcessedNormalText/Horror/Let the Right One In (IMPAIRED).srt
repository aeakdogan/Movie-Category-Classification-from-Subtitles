The
police
have
Remember
the
house
that
burned
A
house
that
burned
to
the
ground.
They
found
someone
in
there.
In
that
case
we
knew
it
was
arson
Because
the
person
had
been
murdered.
So,
how
could
they
know
that?
Yes?
There
was
no
smoke
That's
correct.
Did
you
figure
that
out?
right
now?
No,
I
read
a
lot...
What
kind
of
books,
I
wonder?

Okay...
I'm
going
to
talk
to
What
do
you
think
are


What
are
you
staring
at?
Huh?
You
staring
at
me?
You
better
stop.
What
a
good
piggy
you
are.

Temperatures
ranging
from
20-32
degrees...



Excuse
me...?
Do
you
have
the
time?
I
don't
have
a
watch.
What's
that?
This?
It's
called
halotane.













Ricky!
Ricky!
Beat

What
are
you
staring
at?
Well?
Are
you
looking
at
me?
Well,
fuck
off!
What's
your
problem?
Are
you
scared?
Squeal
then!
Squeal!
What
are
you
doing?
Nothing.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
Do
you
live
here?
I
live
right
here,
in
the
jungle
gym.
Seriously,
where
do
you
live?
Next
door
to
you.
How
do
you
know
where
I
live?
Just
so
you
know,
I
can't
be
your
friend.
Just
so
you
know.
-
What
do
you
mean?
That's
just
how
it
is.
Do
you
think
I
want
to
be
friends
with
you?



You're
supposed
to
help
me!
Do
I
really
have
to
take

Forgive
me.

So
no
one
knows
why
this
boy
I
realize
that
many
of
you
may
be
worried.
The
counselor
will
be
here
all
day,
So
go
talk
to
her
if
you
feel
the
need
Does
anyone
have
any
questions?
Is
it
all
right
to
kill
the
killer

That
wasn't
very
nice,
Conny.

You
will
go

And
you're
not

But
it
was

Vllingby.
So
you
think
someone
who

Can't
take

Or

Yes,

Just
coming...
hi,
there.
I
really
don't
think
the
death
penalty
Has
any
relevance
in
our
society.
It's
just
something
They've
drilled
into
us...
Like
the
Russians
or
something...

Are
you
saying
there
aren't

Of
course
there
are
Russians.
Never
seen

before.

Who's
been
bitten
by
a
snake
here?
He
moved
into
my
building
the
other
day.
They're
in
Janne's
old
place.
-
Should
I
ask
him
over?

What
the
hell?
In
that
case...

Things
not
going
too
well?
Yeah,
life
stinks...
You
just
moved
into
number
15,
right?
You
don't
have
to
sit
here
all
alone,
No
thanks,
I'm
in
a
hurry.


Mom?
I'm
going
out
for
a
while.
Aren't
you
going
to
watch
the
show?
No,
it
wasn't
any
good.
Stay
in
the
yard,
then,
okay?

Well,
I'll
just
watch
this
on
my
own,
then.
You're
here
again?
So
you're
back.?
I
want
to
be
left
alone.
Me
too.
Go
home,
then!
You
go
home,
I've
lived
here
What's
that?
This?
It's
a
Rubiks
cube.
Is
it
some
kind
of
puzzle?
Yeah...
You
want
to
try
it?
You
can
give
it
back
tomorrow.
I
might
not
be
here
tomorrow.
That's
okay.
You
can
borrow
it
till
Monday.
How
does
it
work?
You
want
each
side
to
be
a
solid
color.
Like
this...
You
smell
funny.
Aren't
you
cold?
-
No.
I
guess
I've
forgotten
how.
Guess
I'll
see
you
Monday,
then.
Okay.




Okay.
Thanks
for
tonight.
Good
night,
old
buddy.

-
See
you
tomorrow.
-

You're
the
best,
Jocke!



Help
me.

Hello?
Please,
help
me.
Is
something
wrong?

Are
you
all
right?
-
Can
you
get
up?


I'll
carry
you.

Careful.

You
don't
weigh
a
thing...












Gsta?
Hey,
Gsta!
It's
been
ages.
I
haven't
-
Jocke...

There
was
an
animal
behind...
And
then
I
saw
Jocke...
and
a
little
kid.
It
was
here
somewhere.
Look!
What
the
hell
is
this?
Christ!

It's
blood!
It's
blood,
damn
it!

Who
the
hell
did
this?

Whew...







How
did
you
do
it?
I
just
twisted
it.
Do
I
smell
better
now?
Um,
what's
your
name?
Eli.
What's
yours?
-
Eli?
My
name
is
Oskar.
How
old
are
you?
Twelve...
about.
What
about
you?
12
years,
eight
months,
and
nine
days.
What
do
you
mean,
"about
12"?
When's
your
birthday?
I
don't
know.
Don't
you
celebrate
your
birthday?
Your
parents...
they
have
to
know.
Then
you
don't
get
any
birthday
No.
You
can
have
this
if
you
want.
It's
yours.
I
don't
get
how
you
did
this...
You
want
me
to
show
you?
Here.
Go
ahead.
Start
with
the
corners....
Then
you
take
this
side.
See?


"slipping
in
and
out
of
the
and
keeping
out
of
the
sun;
so
soon
they
went
back,
grumbling
Muttering
and
swearing.
Bilbo
was
saved."

Well
then,
that's
it
for
today!
Has
everyone
handed
in
their
slips

Well
then,
class
dismissed.

Oskar,
aren't
you
going?
Samuel
Morse

What
were
you
writing
down?
What
do
you
mean?
Let
me
see.

No.
What
do
you
mean,
no?
Give
it
here!





Who's
going
to
talk
to
his
mom
Wait
for
me!


Oskar!

I
fell
down
during
recess.
I
tripped
on
this
rock.
Oh,
honey...
You've
got
to
watch
your
step.
Hmm?

Short,
long,
long,
short,
long.
Short,
long,
long,
short,
long.
Exactly.
Here...
What
happened
to
you?
There...
Some
classmates...
Where
do
you
go
to
school,
anyway?
Oskar,
listen...
You
have
to
fight
back.
You've
never
hit
them
back...
Have
you?
Start
hitting
back
now...
Hard.
There
are
three
of
them.
Then
you
have
to
hit
even
harder!
Hit
back
harder
than
you
dare.
Then
they'll
stop.
-
But
if
they...
I
can
do
that.

Come.
Come.



Move
over.


Let's
see,
short,
short...


Ooh-hh...
Vuh...
Guh...

Keep
proper
distance!
Not
too
close,
not
too
far.
Keep
the
distance!
Nice
and
steady.



The
after
school
weight-lifting
Can
I
sign
up
for
it?
You
don't
have
to
sign
up,
just
come.
At
7:00.
Are
you
thinking
of
doing
it?
-
Yes.
You'll
train,
then
you
can
At
least.

Wait
a
minute...


Here.
No.
Too
bad.
I
can...
Try
one.


I'm
sorry.
Oskar...
Do
you
like
me?
Yes,
a
lot.
If
I
wasn't
a
girl...
...would
you
like
me
anyway?
I
guess
so.
Why
do
you
ask?

Oskar!
Hi
buddy!
-
You're
early.





There
are
people
who
recognize
Who
know
I
live
here,
with
you.
-

Maybe
you
shouldn't.
Could
you
do
one
thing
for
me?
Could
you
not
see
that
boy
tonight?
Please?







-

Where's
matte?




Open
the
door.
Matte!
Let
me
down!





Help!
Matte?
Help!

Open
the
god
damn
door!
Help!

Help!
Help!


Help...?

Help!

-
Get
me
down!
I'm
trapped.

have
not
been
Of
the
man
who
was
apprehended
last
On
suspicion
of
murder
and
attempted
In
Vllingby,
in
Western
Stockholm.
Identification
was
difficult...
Because
the
man
injured
himself
In
sports...


Come
on
in.
Through
those
doors.

Yes?
Excuse
me.
I'm
looking
for
my
dad.
Has
he
been
admitted
to
this
hospital?
What's
his
name?
He's
sick.
The
police
brought
him
in.
Do
you
know
where
he
is?
Then
he's
on
level
7.
But
you
can't
just
go
in
there,
-
I
can
call...
It's
not
necessary.



May
I
come
in?







Wake
up,
Virginia.
-
A
kid!
Why
the
hell
would
a
kid

Jocke
was
the
kindest
person
I
know.
I'll
rip
that
damned
kid
to
shreds.



May
I
come
in?
Don't
look
at
me.
But
say
I
can
come
in.
Come
in.


How
did
you
get
here?
I
flew.
Yeah,
sure...
But
you're
not
wearing
any
clothes.
You're
ice
cold!
Sorry.
Is
that
gross?
No...
"bulleri,
bulleri
bock...
How
many
fingers
am
I
tapping
you
with?"
Eli...
Want
to
go
steady?
What
do
you
mean?
I
mean...
Do
you
want
to
go
steady?
Oskar,
I'm
not
a
girl.
No?
Do
I
have
a
Chance
with
you?
Couldn't
we
just
I
guess...
Do
you
do
anything
special
No.
So
everything's
the
same?
Yes.
-
Then
we'll
go
steady.
Then
we're
together.
-
Really?
Good.

Oskar!
What
are
you
doing?


Come

Police

Yes,
it
is.
Now
he's
coming.
They've
called
from
school.
And
you
can
talk
to
your
dad,
because
I...
Hello?
I'm
okay.
I
don't
know.
Is
the
bike
working?
We'll
see.



Hey,
Oskar.
So
you
did
go
swimming
after
all?
I'm
just
kidding.

We're
not
allowed
to
be
here,
really.
This
cellar
is
the
best
place.
We
can
do
whatever
we
want.
And
you
know
what?
Today...
They
tried
to
throw
me
into
a
hole
in
Oskar...
But
I
had
a
stick,
And
I
hit
Conny
in
the
head
So
he
had
to
go
to
the
hospital.
Oskar...?
Huh?
Hooray!

What
were
we
going
to
do?


We're
going
to
mix.
It
doesn't
hurt
at
all.

All
you
have
to
do
is
poke
your
finger.




Eli?
Go!
Get
out
of
here!





Damn
it,

And
shine
bright
lights
in
my
eyes...

-
Jocke
and
I,
we
were
this
close...

In
fact...
It's
your
duty,
you
witnessed
a
crime.
Hell.
I
have
nothing
left...
Now
that
he's
gone.

But
Lacke...
Don't
give
me
your

Ginia?
Wait

What's
going
on
up
there?







-
I
didn't
see
that
one.
Now
I'll
get
you.
You
can
always
dream.

We
have
a

So...
You
look
like
That's
right.

And
Oskar's
here...
Right...
Dad?
It's
your
turn.
Yes,
yes.
But
we
have
a

now.
You

little
something,
then?

It
ended
up

wrong,
you
see.
It
was
supposed
to
be
perfect,
but

Maybe
there
was
something
wrong
with

the
ruler,
or...
Nothing
to
be
scared
of,
kitty.
And
it
was
more
and
more
wrong.
And
now
I
walk
around
and
it
feels
like...
Pretty
damn
busy
Come
on
in.!


Ginia!
Where
the
hell
have
you
been?

What
are
you
doing?
I
need
to
talk
to
you,
damn
it!
-
We've
been
so
fucking
worried!
I
have
to
hold
you.
We've
been
so
fucking
worried.
-
Are
you
crazy?

What's
happening
with
the
cats?
-
Let
us
out,
you
bastard!






Oskar,
is
it
you?
Yes.

Are
you
a
vampire?
I
live
off
blood...
Yes.
Are...
Are
you
dead?
No.
Can't
you
tell?
But
are
you...
Old?
I'm
twelve.
Though
I've
been
12
for
a
long
time.
Are
you
guys
poor?

You
see
the
egg
there?
If
you
sold
that
you
could
buy
a
It's
true.
Oh.
Sure.
Put
your
finger
here.

Those
rings...
Where
did
they
come
from?
I'm
going
home
now.
I'm
going
to
deliver
chocolates
tomorrow.

To
earn
money?
Um-hmm.
But
you
can
have
money
from
me.
Here.
Take
it
if
you
want.
You
stole
this...
...from
the
people
you
killed,
right?
-

It
was
given
to
me....
By
different
people.
I
want
to
go
home
now.
If
you'll
let
me.
Dad's
stamp
collection.
His
whole
life.
One
stamp...
80,000.
Eighty

Sometimes
I
tried
to

interested.
I
He
just
said,
"no,
there
are
others.

There
isn't
a
prettier
place.

Listen
to
the
birds
sing
Lacke,
you
have
to
help
me!
Of
course.
-
That
child.
She
must
have
infected
me
somehow.
I
don't
want
to
live.





Good
morning!
Things
are
looking
up.
Won't
that
be
nice?
I'll
just
unlock
this...
And
take
a
little
blood
sample.
There...
-
Listen...?
Could
you
open
the
shutters,
please?
Sure...
No
problem.


Hand
over
your
cap.
Do
it!
What's
your
problem?
Give
it
to
me.
What
are
you,
some
kind
of
moron?


-
Put
up
a
fight...
-
Hi.
Could
I
borrow
your
keys?
-
Why?
-
Sure.
Here
you
go.
-
Who's
the
boss
at
your
house?
-
What
are
you
laughing
at?


-
Hi.
You
have
to
invite
me
in.
What
happens
if
I
don't?
What
happens
if
you
come
in
anyway?
Is
there
something
in
the
way?
Tsk-tsk-tsk...
Tsk-tsk-tsk.


No!
You
can
come
in!


Who
are
you?
The
same
as
you.
What?
What
are
you
staring
at?
Well?
Are
you
looking
at
me?
Then
squeal
like
a
pig!
Squeal!"
That
was
the
first
thing
I
heard
you
say.
I
don't
kill
people.
No...
But
you'd
like
to,
If
you
could.
To
get
revenge.
Right?
Yes.
Oskar,
I
do
it
because
I
have
to.
Be
me,
for
a
little
while
Please,
Oskar...
Be
me
a
little
while.





Oskar,
can
you
open
the
door?

What
are
you
up
to?

Let
me
in,
Oskar...



Hi!
I'm
in
the
bathroom.
Please
don't
Do
you
want
to
meet
me
tonight?
I
like
you
so
much.
Yours,
Eli.











No!
Huh?








Thank
you.
Oskar...
I've
got
to
go
away.


Who
murdered
the
man
in
the
ice?



Hello.
-
Is
that
you,
Oskar?
It's
me,
Martin
Teacher
was
wondering
if
you're
coming
How
come?
Don't
know.
He
was
just
wondering.
Maybe
he
wanted
you
to
come.
I'm
not
sure...
By
the
way...
I
think
it
was
good,
what
you
did
to
He
had
it
coming.

Damn,
he's
good
at

You
think
so?
You
coming
to
training
tonight?
Pool

Hi,
Oskar.
Hi.


Hey,
Oskar.
Hey.
Now
we'll
start
water
aerobics.

Hurry
up!

Come
on,
Oskar!

Move
your
body...

What?
Christ!



Call
the
fire
department!
Fire!


Out!


Do
you
know
who
I
am?
-
Yes.
Then
you
understand.
We're
going
to
have
a
little
contest
now.
You'll
stay
under
water...
...for
three
minutes.
Do
that,
and
it's
just
a
little
scratch.

If
you
don't...
I'll
poke
one
of
your
eyes
out.
An
eye
for
an
ear,
okay?
But...
that's
impossible.
That's
your
problem.


Three
minutes.
Better
take
a
deep
breath.!
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One.

Jimmy...

Let's
get
out
of
here,
Conny.
