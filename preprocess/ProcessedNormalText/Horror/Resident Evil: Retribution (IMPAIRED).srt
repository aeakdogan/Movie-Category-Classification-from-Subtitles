My
name
is
Alice..
I
worked
for
the
Umbrella
Corporation..
The
largest
and
most
powerful
commercial
entity
in
the
world.
I
was
head
of
security
at
a
secret
A
giant
underground
laboratory
There
was
an
incident,
the
virus
escaped...
A
lot
of
people
died..

Trouble
was..
they
didn't
stay
dead.
The
computer
that
controlled
the
Hive
was
a
state
of
the
art
The
Red
Queen
responded
to
the
threat
She
went
homicidal

The
Red
Queen
attempted
to
kill
everyone
I
managed
to
escape
but
this
was
only
the
beginning.
Viral
outbreak
spread
like
wildfire
First
across
the
United
States,
then
the
world..
But
the
T
virus
didn't
just
bring
the
dead
back
to
life..
It
mutated
them
in
terrifying
ways.
Despite
the
apocalypse
they
had
created
the
I
was
infected
but
the
virus
I
developed
powers..
I
became
different..
Powerful..

Unstoppable..
As
I
got
stronger
the
human
race
became
weaker
I
tried
my
best
to
lead
what
survivors
I
could
find
to
safety,
Even
my
friend
Jill
Valentine
was
Finally
I
confronted
the
head
of
the
He
robbed
me
of
my
powers
but
At
last
we
thought
it
was
over..
But
we
were
wrong..
Once
again
we
found
ourselves
fighting..

Rise
and
shine,
Becky's
not
up
yet,
Ms.
Anderson
is
gonna
be
pissed.
You
know
how
they
get
when
we
Babe!?

You
all
right
babe?
Yeah...

I'll
go
get
Becky.
I
charged
your
batteries
for
you.
Becky?

You
know
Ms.
Anderson,
Thank
you
daddy.

When
you
come
back
from
school
I
heard
that.
The
way
these
batteries
are
lasting
less
-
OK
well
I
can
pick
some
up
on
my
way
home.
-
Ah
Shit!
-
Someone
picked
up
your
dry
cleaning
yesterday.
-
You're
going
to
be
late
remember?

I'll
get
you
that
shirt.
Get
Becky
back..
Ahhh!
No!!
Help!!
Help
Us!!

C'mon!


Go!
Go!!
No!!


Wait!

Wait!!
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you?
C'mon
get
in
the
car!

-
What's
going
on?
-
Why
are
these
people
doing
this?
Not
anymo..


Are
you
hurt?
Can
you
move?

OK.

Oh
shit!!

My
name
is..
One
of
Wesker's
top
agents..
Now
the
real
question
is..
I
don't
work
for
Umbrella
anymore,
-
I
don't
care.
-
Now
be
a
good
girl.
Put
down
the
knife.

Oh
and
Alice?
-
How
did
she
get
out?
-
We
have
a
traitor
in
this
facility.
-
What
about
control?

I
executed
everyone
in
this
control
room,
We
shut
down
the
Security
Systems,

-
So
why
do
you
want
to
help
me?
Our
only
hope
for
survival
is
for
us
to
work
together.
I'm
not
going
anywhere
until
I
know
where
we
are
-
You're
in
the
prime
Umbrella
testing
facility.
What
you
saw
was
just
a
detailed
recreation,
It
goes
on
for
a
few
city
blocks
that's
all.
-
I
was
outside.
-
Saw
the
sky
did
you?
-
Stars?
the
Moon?
It's
usually
night
in
there,
-
It
was
raining.
Why
build
such
a
place?
Simple,
the
Umbrella
Corporation
derived
Something
that's
impossible
to
test
in
the
real
world.
They
recreated
the
center
of
New
York,
simulated
an
outbreak,
They
simulated
an
outbreak
in
Moscow
-
An
outbreak
in
Tokyo.
-
An
outbreak
in
China.
Exactly!

Everyone
had
to
have
it,
Only
this
time
it
was
biological
rather
than
nuclear.
Highly
profitable,
and
this
is
where
it
all
happened.
-
The
belly
of
the
beast.
Stop!

Sun
up
is
in
less
than
1
minute,
This
facility
is
located
in
the
straits
of
The
old
Soviet
Union
built
submarine
pens
here
in
the
80s
After
the
Cold
War
ended
the
Umbrella
Corporation
No
one
has
ever
escaped
from
this
facility.
-
Ice!
So
I've
arranged
for
a
strike
team
There
they
are,
intake
vents
for
the
Umbrella
facility.
-
Looks
abandoned.
Let's
move!
After
that
we
can
expect
heavy
Running
a
bypass.
These
are
the
access
codes
Ada
gave
us.
-
You
trust
her?
-
The
charges
are
set.
Let's
go
do
this.
-
They're
in.
They
will
eliminate
Umbrella
resistance,
-
They
have
a
friend
of
yours
with
them..

Leon
why
don't
we
just
trigger
the
explosives
remotely?
Can't
risk
them
jamming
the
signal,
-
What
if
we
take
longer
than
2
hours?
Security
Chief
Valentine
has
reached
the
Tokyo
They're
headed
this
way.
Her
orders
are
to
recapture
you
if
possible,
-
Who's
giving
these
orders?
-
the
computer?
She
now
controls
what
remains
She
will
stop
at
nothing
to
prevent
I've
plotted
an
escape
route
for
you..
To
suburbia
where
you'll
rendezvous
They'll
escort
you
through
the
And
take
the
elevator
back
to
the
surface.
The
Red
Queen
has
intercepted
my
signal,
You
must
hurry,
I
can't...
Don't
listen
to
the
traitor
Wesker,
Project
Alice,
Ada
Wong
stay
where
you
are.
-
Let's
move
-
You're
all
going
to
die
down
here!
Defensive
formation..
Submarine
pens
are
up
ahead.
Barry,
you
and
I
take
point.


Clear!
-

now
that's
some
hardware!
Umbrella
used
them
to
secretly
Let's
pick
up
the
pace,
we
have
less
than
90
minutes.

-
New
York.
-
Let's
move!
They
want
to
study
the
biohazard,
learn
how
to
control
it.


Standby!
Standby!
The
Red
Queen!
-
Let's
go!

-
You
know
what
it
is?
You've
got
to
be
kidding
me!



Hey
boys..
Bad
idea!

Let's
move!

We're
behind
schedule.
-
What's
going
on?
C'mon..
Before
the
Red
Queen
activates
something
else

Target
survived,
Intruders
entering
Moscow

environment,
-
What's
going
on?

Standby!
Standby!
-
What?
Right
there!
What
the
hell
are
those
things?
Fall
back!

Everyone
fall
back!
-
Clouds?
When
they
were
running
a
simulation
This
is
the
rendezvous
point,
Someone
is
in
the
house
behind
you..
Why
would
they
be
in
here?

-
Of
course!
You
were
one
of
the
50
basic
models.
How
do
you
think
Umbrella
Hundreds
of
people
dead
Umbrella
imprints
them
with
basic
memories..
Just
enough
to
ensure
a
correct
emotional
response
In
one
life
she
could
be
a
suburban
housewife,
The
next
a
soldier
working
for
Umbrella.


Mommy!
I
hid
like
you
told
me.
What
happened
to
your
clothes
RPG..
Down!!
We're
running
out
of
time..
-
You
have
to
find
as
a
way
out
now!
-
None
of
this
is
real.
I
know
that's
the
point.
A
day
ago
she
was
a
blank
slate,
I'm
sorry,
but
it's
true.
-
Ready!
I
was
fast
wasn't
I?
-
Daddy?

-
There's
a
child
here.
-
All
heart,
you
haven't
changed
a
bit.
Now,
surrender
or
die.
Get
down!
Advance,
B
Team!
You
can't
stay
here,
Go
through
Moscow
to
the
submarine
pens,
take
this,
Alpha
team
forward!
They're
coming
we
have
to
hurry,
Go!

I
got
it,
this
way!
-
Hey!
You
two
made
it..
What
is
this
place
and
why
is
everything
in
Russian?
And
what's
with
the
S&M
Getup?
-
You
know
how
to
use
this?
No
I
don't
think
you
understand,
Concentrate..
Congratulations
you're
officially
a
bad
ass!

I'll
explain
when
I
get
back,
-
You
stay
with
her.
Trust
me
OK?

What
I
say
is
true..
-
You
promise?
I
love
you.
Come
on,
she'll
be
back
for
you.
I
met
your
sister,
Let's
try
hiding
down
here.
-
This
way!
We
can
work
our
way
around
the...

Waiting
for
a
written
invitation?

-
Sweet
ride!
I
heard
gunfire,
-
Where's
Ada?
-
You
saw
her
die?
She
always
has
a
plan.
Boys?
You
mind?
-
Shall
we?

Let
me
know
when
you
plan
on
doing
that
again.
Heads
up!

Our
little
friend
is
back!
Oh
Shit!
-
Almost
there.

-
Is
everyone
OK?
OK
let's
go.
Hello?
You
can
come
out!
I'm
back!
Where'd
you
find
these
guys?
-
Who's
this?
-
Hi
Becky.
-
Your
mom?
Oh!
22
minutes
left.
-
There's
no
going
back
the
way
we
came.
I'm
on
it!
We
can
take
this
tunnel
at
the
end
there's
a
service
shaft
Let's
go!

-
How'd
you
end
up
working
for
Wesker?
Wesker
said
you
knew
of
some
weapon,
But
I
don't
think
I
would've
risked
so
much
You're
probably
right.
This
way!
C'mon
move!
-
The
elevator
platforms
are
up
ahead.
-
11
minutes,
we're
gonna
be
OK.
Everybody
get
onboard!
Hold
on!
Get
down!
-
Barry
what
is
it?
-
Where
are
you
going?
Be
strong,
-
Can
you
get
it
back
online?
9
minutes..
-
What?

No!!!

Mommy!!

Mommy!!

She's
dead!
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
I
didn't
lose
this
many
friends
so
you
could
just
walk
away.
Don't
do
this,
you're
more
important
than
she
is.
-
That's
where
you're
wrong.
Get
out
of
my
way.
-
Don't
leave
without
me
OK?
-
Don't
move,
don't
move.
You
like
that,
Huh?
Fall
back!
-
Fall
back
to
the
elevator!
-
Barry!
Someone's
gotta
stay
here
Leon..
-
Go,
go!




Go!
Bring
out
the
prisoner!
Cease
your
firing
or
I'll
execute
her.
Now,
put
down
your
guns
and
step
out.
Step
out
or
she
dies.

Mommy
who
are
they?
Mommy
who
are
they?
Mommy
is
that
you?

-
You're
my
mommy
aren't
you?


What's
going
on?
What
the
hell
is
that?
-
Becky
are
you
hurt?
Told
you
she'd
have
a
plan.
-
Only
the
two
of
you?
The
Los
Plagos
parasite.





Alice!!
-
You
can't
kill
me.

-
I'm
coming
for
you.

Leon..

-
What
is
it?
-
Glad
to
have
you
back.


Wesker..
Well
I
must
say
it
does
have
a
certain
ease
to
it.

What
is
this?
You
were
the
only
one
to
To
fully
realize
her
powers,
So
I've
given
you
back
your
gift..
-
I'm
gonna
kill
you.
But
first
you
have
work
to
do.
The
Red
Queen
is
determined
This
is
the
last
that
remain
of
us,
It
seems
we're
bonded
against
a
common
foe,
This
is
humanity's
last
stand,
the
beginning
of
the
end.
