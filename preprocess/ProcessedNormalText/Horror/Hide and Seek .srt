Ready
to
go
faster?
All
right.
No,
no,
no!
You're
gonna
slide
off.
Oh!
You
all
right?
-
Are
you
sliding?
No,
if
you're
sliding,
-
No,
no,
no.
More?
Yes!
That's
funny.
I
could've
sworn
by
the
name
Come
out,
come
out,
wherever
you
are...
Could
she
be
hiding
I
wonder
where
she
could
be.
Hmm...
Maybe
my
eyes
I'm
invisible,
Mommy.
Well,
if
you're
invisible...
...then
how
could
I...
do
this?!
Did
you
know
where
I
was?
Not
a
clue.
You
want
Alex?
What
is
it?
I
love
you
more
You
know
that,
don't
you?
I
love
you,
too.
Good
night,
sweetheart.
Make
the
face.
Please.
-
Now,
go
to
sleep.
Mommy!
Sorry.
Good
night.
You
coming
to
bed?
In
a
little
while.
Something
you
want
to
talk
about?
Some
things
are
beyond
therapy,
David.
Honey?
I
should've
seen
it
coming.
All
the
signs
were
there.
The
ones
closest
to
you
No,
but
I...
I
could've
prevented
it.
David,
it's
not
your
fault.
How
long
have
Trust
me
when
I
tell
you
this.
As
difficult
you're
gonna
have
to
try
We're
gonna
move.
Upstate.
The
country.
That's
not
exactly
what
What
about
Emily?
This
is
a
traumatic
time
for
her.
I
think
it's
important
she
stays
No,
here,
she's
I
need
to
expose
her
new
things
to
do...
She'd
be
losing
another
person
It's
only
an
hour
away.
And...
you're
always
welcome
And
right
now,
I
need
to
do
I
need
to
be
I
have
a
surprise
for
you.
When
I
was
your
age,
And
whenever
I
was
feeling
sad,
I
would
open
the
lid,
Do
you
like
it?
Give
me
a
hug.
You're
going
to
like
it
there.
All
right,
let's
go.
Come
on.
Let's
take
a
look.
Right
on
time.
Dr.
Callaway...
Mr.
Haskins.
Hello.
This
is
Sheriff
Hafferty.
Sheriff.
He
routinely
checks
to
make
sure
things
I
see.
Well,
this
is
my
daughter,
Emily.
Emily.
How
are
you?
This
is
Mr.
Haskins.
He
found
us
the
house.
Well,
hello
there,
Emily.
Think
your
dad
did
a
good
job
She's
still
deciding.
Well,
she
sure
is
pretty.
Thank
you.
As
I
mentioned,
Woodland
Estates
a
summer
community.
May
be
a
little
quiet
Hope
that's
not
a
problem.
-
Not
at
all.
Let
me
show
you
You
ever
spent
much
time
in
the
country?
Not
much.
I
used
to
camp
but
I
was
always
scared
Nothing
to
be
scared
of
Picked
a
nice
spot.
Biggest
house
on
the
lake.
Sheriff,
if
you'd
like
let
Dr.
Callaway
Figure
out
which
key...
Did
you
see
where
Emily!
Emily!
Emily!
Honey?
You
okay?
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Mr.
Haskins,
Sheriff...
Spaghetti
and
meatballs
You're
not
hungry?
I'd
like
to
go
to
bed
now.
I'll
come
up
Oh,
that's
funny.
I
could
have
sworn
by
the
name
of
Emily
I
wonder...
where
she's
hiding.
Could
she
be...
under
the
bed?!
No.
Could
she
be...
hiding...
Let's
see,
where
Could
she
be
Okay...
since
it's
the
first
night
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
Each
day
you
your
feelings
and
then,
one
day,
and
see
Hmm?
I
love
you
more
than
anything
You
know
that.
That's
what
Mommy
said.
Hmm?
Before
she
killed
herself.
Sweetheart,
And
so
do
I.
You
want
me
to
put
this
over
here?
Okay.
All
right.
Good
night.
Good
night,
Alex.
Emily?
Emily!
Em?
Emily?
Oh,
there
you
are.
Come
on,
sweetheart.
We're
going
into
town.
Oh...
Hello.
Hi...
Hi,
there.
L-I'm
Laura.
Oh,
I'm
David.
Uh,
here.
Oh,
thank
you
very
much.
My
husband
and
I
made
Oh,
well...
I
didn't
even
realize
Well,
it
does
get
pretty
quiet
Oh,
this
is
my
Emily,
say
hello
to
Laura.
She's
our
neighbor.
Isn't
she
adorable?
You
going
to
say
hi?
Well,
she
gets
a
little
shy
around
new
faces.
I
understand.
It's
going
to
be
a
real
treat
Oh,
you're
on
your
way
out.
I
won't
keep
you.
Um,
if
you
need
anything,
Same
here.
And
thank
you
The
peach
and
apricot
preserves.
-
Enjoy.
I'm
gonna
put
this
inside.
Amy,
don't
swing
so
high.
I'm
going
Would
you
listen
to
me?
Hi.
Hi.
I
have,
uh,
She's
in
the
car.
Oh.
I'm
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth
Young.
Hi.
-
How
are
you?
Nice
to
meet
you.
Are
you
visiting?
Just
moved
up
Oh,
usually
it's
I
know.
She
your
kid?
Oh,
no.
No.
She's
my
sister's
kid.
I'm
the
honorary
baby-sitter.
Watch.
Amy,
be
careful.
Amy...
Oh...
-
Amy.
Amy,
Jesus,
That's
very
funny.
Oh,
my
God,
you're
you
know
that?
Is
your
daughter
Where's
Alex?
I
don't
like
her
anymore.
Did
I
just
hear
Are
you
mad,
Daddy?
No,
I'm
not
mad
at
all,
honey.
I
think
it's
great.
You
do?
Yeah.
Good.
Because
I
have
a
new
friend.
A
new
friend?
Okay.
Let
me
guess.
Veronica?
No.
Uh,
is
it,
uh,
Patty?
Is
it...
He's
not
a
doll.
He's...
Not
a
doll.
He.
Okay,
well,
if
he's
not
a
doll,
He
doesn't
want
me
Doesn't
want
you
No.
Well,
what
if
I
promise
to
keep
it
a
secret,
So,
what's
his
name?
He
told
me
to
call
him
Charlie.
Charlie?
Oh,
that's
Charlie.
When
did
you
meet
Charlie?
Today.
When
we
went
to
town?
It
was
before
that.
Before
that.
Huh.
Is
he...
here
right
now?
I
think
he's
sleeping.
Okay.
Well,
in
that
case,
we
better
not
wake
him,
hmm?
It's
not
unusual
for
a
traumatized
child
I
know,
I
just
wish
instead
of
using
fantasy.
Trauma
causes
pain.
Eventually
the
mind
No
kidding.
Don't
forget:
I'm
the
one
As
a
matter
of
fact,
you
did,
yes.
Just
have
fun
with
her,
David.
Play
with
her.
That's
what
she
needs.
These
are
beginner
rods.
Let's
see...
two
rods,
$41.50
each...
Plus
bait
and
tackle...
Sheriff.
You
parked
in
a
handicap
zone.
Oh,
I
didn't
even
realize.
Could
you
give
me
a
break?
Enjoy
your
day.
Eh,
so
much
for
small
town
-
Shut
the
door.
I
know
we
broke
the
law.
Shut
the
door.
The
Loch
Ness
Monster.
What?
You
know
what
that
is?
It's
in
Scotland.
This
is
a
good
spot,
huh?
Honey,
what
are
you
doing?
You
think
that's
a
good
idea?
Emily,
we
have
bait.
See?
All
right.
Did
you
have
It
was
okay.
Just
okay?
Mm...
Well,
then,
what
could
we
What
if
Charlie
was
there?
Would
he
have
made
it
better?
He's
a
lot
of
fun.
Fun
like
how?
Fun
like
Mommy.
It's
a
little
stuffy
in
here.
It's
stuck.
It's
okay,
Daddy.
It
just...
...three,
two,
one...
Happy
New
Year!
Emily,
why
would
you
do
this?
I
didn't
do
it.
What
do
you
mean,
There's
nobody
here
but
us.
It
wasn't
me.
This
is
your
writing,
It's
all
right.
Just
tell
me.
You
don't
have
to
lie
to
me.
I'm
not
lying.
Okay,
well,
then
who
did?
It
was
Charlie.
She
thinks
I'm
responsible
She
thinks
I'm
responsible
for
Alison's
death.
It's
Charlie
Use
him,
David.
Use
him
to
get
through
to
her.
He's
the
key.
L-I
have
to
go,
I...
I
think
I
found
her
Really?
That's
great.
Call
me
if
you
need
me,
okay?
-
Bye.
Hi.
-
Hi.
Hi,
Amy.
Glad
you
came.

Hi.
Hi.
Coffee-maker
Oh,
God...
Thank
you.
So,

that
your
wife?
She
passed
away.
I'm
sorry.
No
matter
how
many
times
I
say
it,
Must
be
hard
on
Emily.
Have
you
ever
been
married?
Actually,
I
just
got
divorced.
I'm
living
with
my
sister
and
her
husband
till
I
can
Best
way

get
over
the
past
That's
why
we're
here.

it
up
in
toilet
paper,
What
shall
it
be?
Oh!
By
the
way,
Thanks.
You're
gonna
like
it
here.
It's
a
lot
of
fun.
Well,
it's
not
always
fun,
but
there
are
lots
Oh...
She's
beautiful.
What's
her
name?
Well,
you
don't
talk
much,
You
shouldn't
be
here.
Why
not?
You
could
get
hurt.
-
Oh,
my
God.
So,
um...
so,
I'll
talk
to
you
soon.
Okay...
I
guess
I
should

Yeah.

Emily.
So...

Did
you
like

any
more
friends.
Good,

Perfect.

door.

Bye.
Listen,

anything,
just
give
a
shout,
will
you?
Okay.
Thank
you.
David?
Yeah?
You're
very
lucky
to
have
Thank
you.
You
remember
about
not
talking
He's
not
a
stranger.
What
do
you
mean?
He's
our
neighbor.
As
far
as
I'm
concerned,
Don't
walk
away
I'm
telling
you
something.
I'm
sorry,
Daddy.
No,
I
wasn't
finished.
What
I'm
saying
is,
for
you
to
listen
Okay.
Okay?
What
are
you
doing,
Nothing.
What's
so
funny?
Is
Charlie
here?
He
just
left.
Where'd
he
go?
Did
you
open
that?
I
thought
you
did.
I
want
to
talk
to
Charlie.
What
would
you
like
I'd
like
to
talk
to
him
Like
what?
Like,
uh...
well,
what
makes
him
sad...
So,
what
do
you
say?
You
think
you
can
introduce
us?
I
don't
think
that's
going
to
work.
Why's
that?
He
doesn't
like
you
very
much.
Oh,
why
doesn't
he
Does
it
have
something
Honey?
What
does
he
tell
you?
...three,
one
thousand,
four,
one
thousand,
five,
one
thousand,
six,
one
thousand,
seven,
one
thousand,
eight,
one
thousand,
nine,
one
thousand,

one
thousand.
Ready

Charlie...
Charlie...
Charlie...
Come

Charlie?
Is
that
you?
Emily!
Emily!
Emily!
Where
are
you?
What
happened?
Why
are
you
down
here?
Emily,
talk
to
me.
He
was
hiding.
Who
was
hiding?
In
the
dark.
Can
I
go
to
bed
now?
Hi.
Hi.
Do
you
have
a
minute?
Yeah.
Oh,
sure.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
I
wanted
to
apologize
for
my
husband.
He
said
he
had
a...
yesterday
That's
all
right.
He's
harmless,
really.
That's
fine.
It's
just
that...
we
lost
a
child
recently...
and
in
some
ways,
I
see.
He
was
just...
reaching
out.
Hmm?
There
is
nothing
worse
Here,
taste
this.
I
think
it
may
be
too
salty.
Oh.
Okay.
-
Not
bad.
-
Not
bad.
Really
good.
Wow!
You
look
so
pretty.
You
didn't
have
to
get
Honey,
would
you
go
upstairs
and
change
Don't
you
like
it?
Not
for
dinner,
no.
Why
not?
You
know
why.
She
looks
so
pretty.
I
think
you
look
Did
Daddy
tell
you
Yes,
he
did.
And
I'm
very
sorry.
Did
he
tell
you
Honey,
I
don't
think
Elizabeth
how
that
happened,
She
killed
herself
-
Emily...
Emily.
That's
enough.
Emily,
I
brought
you
something.
Your
dad
asked
me
to
bring
over
some
of
Amy's
books.
These
were
some
when
I
was
your
age.
Oh,
that's
great.
Give
you
a
chance
to
see
before
you
get
started.
You
gonna
say
thanks?
Emily...
Emily...
Emily,
stop
it.
Do
you
like
her,
Daddy?
-
Stop
this.
-
Go
to
your
room.
-
as
much
as
Mommy.
If
you're
going
to
behave
Let's
hope
you
don't
I'm
sorry.
Who's
Charlie?
Oh,
he's
her
imaginary
friend.
Her
only
friend.
I
always
wanted
her
to
have
Now
look.
Drive
safely.
Attention,
please!
Maybe
after
Charlie
did
it.
You
do
believe
me,
Why
are
you
looking
at
me
Mr.
Callaway.
I
didn't
mean
to
disturb
you.
Thought
you
might
Those
are
the
keys
different
rooms
in
the
house.
I
forgot
to
give
them
I
apologize.
It's
a
little
late
to
be
Well,
I
thought
I
could
slip
Wife
and
I
are
going
to
Canada
first
thing
We've
got
a
little
cabin
Good
place
to
clear
the
mind.
Everything
all
right?
Well,
enjoy.
What's
for
breakfast?
Honey,
why
would
Charlie
Is
it
because
of
Elizabeth?
Charlie
needs
to
understand
Elizabeth
is
not
trying
Does
he
understand
that?
Honey,
I
can't
help
you
if
you
don't
talk
to
me.
Why
doesn't
he
like
Elizabeth?
Because
she
likes
you.
And?
He
doesn't
want
you
to
be
happy.
Honey...
you
know
this
has
nothing
You
do
know
that.
It's
about
you,
honey.
And
that's
okay.
Charlie
doesn't
exist.
You
shouldn't
say
that.
Why
not?
You're
going
to
make
him
mad.
Oh,
well,
so
what?
I'll
get
him
mad.
Let
him
come
out
I
want
to
see
him.
You
want
to
see
him?
Who's
that
supposed
to
be?
Charlie
and
Mommy.
She
would
have
liked
him.
No,
trust
me,
honey.
Mommy
wouldn't
like
Charlie.
That's
not
what
he
says.
What
do
you
mean?
What
do
you
mean?
What
does
he
say?
What
does
Charlie
say?
Talk
to
me.
He
says
he
would
Who
told
you
to
say
that?
Charlie
did.
No,
who...
Charlie
did.
There
is
no
Charlie.
Charlie
did!
He
did
not.
Who
said
it?
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Hey...
Hey,
sweetheart.
I'm
so
happy
you
came.
It's
so
good
to
see
you.
Want
to
show
me
the
house?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey,
David.
Good.
Good
to
see
you,
too.
Glad
you
could
come.
Do
you
like
it
here?
I'm
having
a
lot
of
fun.
You
are?
Tell
me
about
He
doesn't
like
me
I'm
sure
he
wouldn't
mind
Tell
me,
what
do
you
Play
games.
What
kind
of
games?
Hide
and
seek.
That's
our
favorite.
Sounds
like
Charlie's
So
what
do
you
guys
talk
about?
I
don't
know.
Bunch
of
things.
Sometimes
he
even
Really.
And
what
does
he
say?
You
can
tell
me.
He's
afraid
you're
In
the...
Our
game.
What
game
is
that?
Upsetting
Daddy.
Isn't
she
pretty?
David,
I'd
like
At
least
for
a
little
while,
I'm
just
worried
bringing
her
back
She's
not
well.
I
know
that.
And
she's
not
your
patient.
I
know
that,
too.
She
thinks
it's
a
game.
She's
using
Charlie
I
know
things
haven't
gone
do
you
really
think
is
going
to
make
It's
worth
a
try.
All
right,
look.
I'll
give
it
two
more
weeks,
