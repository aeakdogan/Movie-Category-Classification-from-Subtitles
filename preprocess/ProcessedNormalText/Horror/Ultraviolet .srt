Yes,
I

day
the
trouble
began
for
me
Violet,
my
God.
The
same
day
I
lost
my
husband...
...my
future,
my
life.
And
I,
too,
disappeared
deep
inside

to
the
indignity
of

experimentation.
Like
others,
the
disease

A

shorter.

maximum,
Unlike
others,
I
converted

Like
others,
however,
...and
it
didn't
help
And,
no,
we
weren't
superhuman.
Though
we
were
a

faster
and
...we
die
just
like
everyone
else.
And
just
like
everyone
else,
And
though
I
was
resuscitated
back
...the
one
I'd
carried

so
lucky.

there
To

Yeah,

They're

There

We

too
well.
Now,
must

sound?
lt's
just

Too

You

For

So

Why?
Why?

Because...

It's
