Sharon.

We're

we're

Yeah.

It's

you're
crazy,
okay.
JOHN:
It's
what
my
parents
did
when
they
hit
...and
it
worked
for
them.
I
understand,
of
course.
But
you
two
hit
more
In
a
matter
of
months,
you've
experienced
And
the
very
best.
A
pendulum
swing
like
that
is
enough
to
But
you
survived.
And
instead
of
trying
to
forget
...I
think
you
should
use
it
as
an
example
You
don't
come
out
the
other
side
You
come
out
stronger.
You're
right.
Good.
-
Hey!
-
Mia,
right?
And,
of
course,
I
remember
Leah.
-
Hi.
John.
This
is
Evelyn.
She
owns
the
bookstore
-
Right.
Yeah.
Thank
you
for
the
book.
I
saw
your
girls
and
I
felt
like
So
where
is
this
beautiful
family
off
to?

We're
just
seeing

out.
-
They
put
me
on
the
night
shift.
They
say
that
I'm
being
rewarded.
Well,
if

ever
want

MIA:

Leah!


Help
me!
Help
me!






MIA:
I'm
sorry.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
for
meeting
with
me.
It's
fine.
I
was
a
little
surprised
to
hear
from
you,
I
said
I
didn't
want
to
know
any
more.
Having
had
a
little
distance
I
am...
Well,
I
realized
I
could
use
some
closure.
I
mean,
there're
just
too
many
I
understand.
I
brought
what
I
have
That's
Annabelle
there.
That
was,
clearly,
taken
Looks
a
lot
different
than
the
last
time
This
cult
that
she
was
in...
...did
you
look
further
into
it?
For
what,
specifically?
I
don't
know,
there
must
have
been
-
Crazy
people
do
crazy
things.
They
didn't
think
they
were
crazy.
They
had
to
have
had
a
reason.
After
a
little
more
digging,
I
did
That
they
were
actually
Like
what?
The
Devil?
Demons?
The
Tooth
Fairy.
-
It
doesn't
really
matter
anywa...
Well,
because
this
is
all
just
Um...
Please.
CLARKIN:
...these
were
miscreants.
They
were
probably
hopped
up
...and
it
made
them
see
...terrible
things.
Does
this
mean
anything
to
you?
Have
you
ever
heard
the
expression:
"Sometimes
a
cigar
is
just
a
cigar"?
Then
you
won't
mind
Um...
And
one
more
thing.
They
called
themselves
Hello
again.
Is
there
anything
I
can
help
you
with?
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
I
just
learned
something.
You're
a
terrible
liar.
Now,
what
is
it
you're
looking
for?
-
Maybe
I'll
come
back.
I'm
old.
Which
means
there's
very
little
And
if
it
does,
Now,
you
gonna
tell
me?
-
Or
we
just...
Aisle
four.
Follow
me.
I
know
it
sounds
crazy,
the
ghost
No
crazier
than
the
Red
Sea
parting.
To
nonbelievers,
it's
all
crazy.
So
you
believe
in
this
stuff?
Let's
just
say
that
I've
had
one
...that
have
helped
me
I
don't
particularly
think
what
you're
Why
not?
Well,
ghosts
haunt
specific
places.
Usually
where
something
terrible
Like
your
old
house.
But
we
moved
and
it's
still
happening.
Which
is
why
I
don't
think
it's
a
ghost.
But
now,
that
cult?
You
said
that
they
were
From
what
I've
read
in
the
past...
...these
cults,
They
summon
inhuman
spirits.
Something
that's
never
existed
Demons.
What
do
they
want?
A
soul.
And
they
won't
stop
until
they
get
one.
What
do
I
do?
Hopefully,
the
answer
My
daughter,
Ruby.
She
passed
away
I'm
sorry.
Without
her,
I
felt
like
But
as
I
lay
there,
...I
heard
her
voice.
She
told
me
that
it
wasn't
my
time.
That
God
had
another
purpose
for
me.
You,
too,
have
a
purpose,
Mia.
To
protect
your
family.
So
don't
think
you're
crazy
You
do
what
you
think
is
right.
You
do
what
you
have
to
do.

MIA:

Devil

on

weak

Seeking
to
devour
their
souls...
To
perform
incantations...
Spilling

do

MIA:


What
happened?
Help
us.
You
gotta
help
us,
John.

Thank
you
for
coming,
Father.
I'll
take
your

I
see
it?

John

rid

I

the

can
sometimes
use

"Their

goal"?
Our
souls,
John.
That's
why
it's
after
Leah.
-
It
wants
her
soul.
Demons
can't
just
take
souls,
Mia.
A
soul
needs
to
be
offered
Well,
I
don't
plan
on
offering
The
Devil
is
the
father
of
lies.
Demons
are
his
manipulators.
No
one
ever
plans
to
offer
their
soul.
How
do
we
get
rid
of
it?
-
How
do
we
stop
it
from
coming
back?
Not
yet.
But
someone
at
the
church
might.
At
the
very
least,
I've
heard
of
a
married
couple
...that
deal
with
this
type
of
thing.
They're
back
East,
What
do
we
do
in
the
meantime?
I
can't
have
Leah
Let
me
take
her.
Perhaps,
if
she's
stored
...it
will
weaken
the
demon
enough,
Thank
you,
Father.
Of
course.
JOHN:
Come
on,
let's
get
you
to

Oh,
no.
No,
John.
I
can't.
Mia.

on,

What
if
I...
What
if
I
just
stayed
up
with
her?
You
get
some
rest.

All
right?

night.

Yeah?

you
for
believing

she
said
Heh.
You
are
going
to
spoil
her.
I
haven't
had
a

for

And
Oh,
I
don't

if
that
is
true.
Well,
we'll
certainly
find
out
with

Oh,

Oh,

know
what,

down

used

MIA:

What
was
it
that
you
were
humming?
An
old
blues
ditty.
It
was
the
only
thing
that
would
settle
Do
you
mind
if
I
ask
how
she
passed?
-
If
you
don't
wanna
talk
about
it,
it's
fine.
It
was
a
car
accident.
We
were
driving
back
from
my
parents'.
They
live
up
north.
So,
uh,
I
was
tired,
you
know.
Family
will
do
that
to
you.
And
it
was
very
late
and

shouldn't

thing
I
remember
was...
...looking
over
...at
my
daughter
asleep.
Mia,
she
had
grown
I
woke
up
three
weeks
later...
...and
Ruby
never
did.
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
say
goodbye.
I
didn't
get
to
beg
God
I
made
the
mistake...
...and
she
paid
the
price.

Father.
Where
is
it?
-
Where's
what?
You
took
it
with
you.
The
evil.
Its
presence.
I
saw
it,
John.
I
felt
it.
I
felt
how
much
it
wants.
Wants
what?
To
take
her
soul.
But
you
said
that
it
can't
take
Leah's.
Yes.
And
a
baby
cannot
offer
its
soul.
Oh,
my
God.
Mia.


Here,
I'll
get
her.
