Hey,
Are
you

Yeah.
You
need
some
help?
No.
Annie,

you
doing?
I'm
fine,
dad.
What's
the
matter?
What's
going
on?
Annie?
Dad.
I
love
you.
I
know.
I
just
want
you
and
mom
to
know
Dad,
I'm
sorry
that
I
can
be
such
I
don't
know
why
I
do
that.
Just
know
that
I
love
you,
okay.
I
just
really
love
you
both.
Hey,
Jay.
Hey,
what's
up?
Nothing.
I'm
going
to
watch
a
moive.
Actually,
I'm
going
out
tonight.
That
guy?
I
like
hm.
Me
too.
I
see
you.
What're
you
reading?
The
idiot.
Is
it
any
good?
I
don't
know
yet.
It's
about
Paul.
Hey,
Jay.
Hey,
Paul.
Stop.
Hey,
I've
an
idea.
What?
It
got
away.
You
ever
played
the
'Trade'
game?
No,
what
is
that?
It's
people
watching
game.
My
sister
and
I
used
to
play
You
are
bored
right
now?
No,
shut
up.
Let
me
finish.
Okay,
how
do
you
play
it?
You
start
by
watching
the
crowd.
Casually
just
go
by
the
people
Okay.
Now,
without
telling
me.
Pick
a
person
you
want
to
It
can
be
anyone,
Okay.
Now,
I
get
2
guesses
to
figure
out.
Who
you
pick.
Okay,
That
guy.
No.
Okay
then.
Him.
The
dad?
No.
I
mean
how
cool
that'll
be.
You
know.
Come
on
It's
not
like
you
are
old.
I
know,
Look
how
happy
that
kid
is.
Plus,
at
that
age
you
could
go
to
the
Total
freedom.
Yeah.
Splashing
his
shirt
right
now.
Yeah,
exactly.
Okay,
my
turn.
Okay.
Okay,
got
it.
How
about
the
girl
in
Where?
Right
there.
I
don't
see
her.
Right
there.
Are
you
teasing
me?
I'm
sorry,
I
just...
Can
we
go?
I'm
sorry,
I
just
have
to
go.
If
you
uh...
Can
we...
can
we
go
Is
there
someone
in
there
Like
an
ex-girlfriend
or
something?
You
said
you
saw
a
Is
that
someone
that
you
knew?
No,
I
just
felt
sick.
Thanks
for
walking
with
me.
Mom
knows
you
smoke.
Yeah
but,
she'll
cry
if
Or
she'll
just
steal
your
cigarettes.
How's
it
going
with
you?
Good.
Honestly.
I
don't
know.
Why?
He
said
he
wasn't
feeling
well
Something
else
was
on
his
mind.
Have
you.
No.
I
know
he
wants
to,
but...
I
don't
know.
Do
you
smell
that?
Like
uh..
That's
my
favorite
flavor.
I...
love
it.
Let's
go
back
to
the
car.
That's
funny.
I
used
to
day
dream
about
Driving
around
with
my
friends
I
had
this
image
of
myself.
Holding
hands
with
a
Listening
to
the
radio.
Driving
along
some
pretty
road.
Up
north
maybe.
And
the
trees
start
to
change
colors.
It's
never
about
going
anywhere
really.
Some
sort
of
freedom
I
guess.
Never
old
enough,
Jay.
You
awake?
I'm
sorry.
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
Don'
t
worry.
You're
not
going
to
believe
me.
But
I
need
you
to
remember
Okay?
This
thing.
It's
going
to
follow
you.
Somebody
gave
it
to
me.
And
I
pass
it
to
you.
Back
in
the
car.
It
could
look
like
someone
you
know.
Or
it
could
be
a
stranger
in
a
crowd.
Whatever
helps
it
to
get
close
to
you.
He
could
look
like
anyone.
But
there
is
only
one
of
it.
Help.
Help!
And
sometimes.
Sometimes
I
think
it
looks
like.
People
you
love.
I
see
it.
Who
is
it?
You
get
rid
of
it,
Just
sleep
with
someone
Just
pass
it
along
If
it
kills
you.
Do
you
understand?
What
the
fuck
do
you
want?
Jay,
Just
to
let
you
know,
Help!
Help
me.
Never
go
into
a
place
that
It's
very
slow.
Can
I
have
some?
Yeah.
Listen
to
this,
I
think
that
if
one
is
faced
by
if
a
house
is
falling
upon
you,
one
must
feel
a
great
longing
to
sit
down,
close
one's
eyes
and
wait,
come
what
may...
That's
why
we're
drinking
on
the
porch.
Is
you
mom
asleep
already?
Almost
for
sure.
She
wakes
up
at
5.15.
That
would
kill
me.
So.
Where
is
Jay
at?
On
a
date.
Your
turn.
Who
is
he?
Somebody
new.
Of
course.
Your
sister
is
so
pretty.
It
is
annoying.
Anyway,
she's
nice.
Is
everything
okay?
Don't
let
it
touch
you.
Jay!
What
happened?
I
don't
know.
Those
people
are
such
a
mess.
It
was
consensual.
Yeah.
And,
you
never
see
the
woman
before?
No.
Okay.
Have
you
ever
been
to
his
home?
I
know
where
he
live,
I
never
went
inside.
He
said
he
was
embarrassed
where
he
lived.
Did
she
catch
anything?
I
don't
think
so.
Ah...
Apparently
he
used
a
fake
name
The
police
searched
the
place,
Oh
my
God.
Breaks
my
heart
the
things
he
said
to
her.
Some
weird,
sick.
"I
should
have
been
a
pair
of
ragged
claws
scuttling
across
floors
of
silent
seas"
And
the
afternoon,
the
evening,
Smoothed
by
long
fingers,
Asleep

tired

or
it
malingers,
Stretched
out
on
the
floor,
Should
I,
after
tea
and
cakes
and
ices,
Have
the
strength
to
force
But
though
I
have
wept
and
fasted,
wept
and
prayed,
Though
I
have
seen
my
head
brought
in
upon
a
platter,
I
am
no
prophet
I
have
seen
the
moment
And
I
have
seen
the
eternal
Footman
hold
my
coat,
and
snicker,
And
in
short,
I
was
afraid.
And
would
it
have
been
worth
it,
after
all,
After
the
cups,
the
marmalade,
the
tea,
Among
the
porcelain,
Would
it
have
been
worth
while,
To
have
bitten
off
the
matter
with
a
smile,
To
have
squeezed
the
universe
into
a
ball
To
roll
it
toward
some
To
say:
I
am
Lazarus,
come
from
the
dead,
Come
back
to
tell
you
all,
If
one,
settling
a
pillow
by
her
head,
Should
say:
That
is
not
it,
at
all.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Hello?
Hello.
There's
an
old
woman
at
school
today.
And
she's
staring
at
me.
It
was
like
she
was
following
me.
Did
you
know
her?
No,
but
she
freaked
me
out.
I
didn't
go
back
to
class.
Did
she
say
something
to
you?
Hugh
told
me
that.
He
passed
it
on
to
me.
He
said
it
was
going
to
follow
me.
That's
all
bullshit,
Yeah,
I
know.
What
exactly
is
suppose
to
be
I
don't
know.
You
should
tell
mom
what
you
saw.
No.
Jay.
I
could..
stay
over
tonight,
-
No.
Sleep
on
the
couch
No.
Maybe
just
on
the
couch.
You
should
be
more
worry
about
waking
up
Um...
I
choosing
to
ignore
all
these
insults
Just,
Look.
I'm
going
to
stay
up
all
night,
Nothing
is
going
to
happen,
I
can't
sleep.
Not
in
there.
That's
okay.
Just
sleep
here.
Are
you
okay?
Everything
is
going
to
be
cool.
That's
funny.
I
haven't
spent
a
night
over
here
There's
a
reason
for
that.
Shut
up.
I'm...
It's
cool
spending
time
with
you.
Yeah.
You're
my
first
kiss,
I
know.
Is
that
not
yours?
No
uh.
You
were.
And
then
you
kissed
Kelly.
She
told
me.
You
kiss
your
sisters,
Do
you
remember,..
...the
time.
That
we
found
those
...in
the
alley
by
Barry's
pizza?
Yeah.
We're
such
stupid
kids.
Ridiculous.
We
are
all
With
a
dozen
dirty
magazines.
Just
sprawled
out
everywhere.
And
we
didn't
realised
Oh,
and
Greg's
mom.
Remember
her
face
when
she
came
out.
And
she
scooped
them
up
so
fast.
And
then
she
called
me
mom.
Kel
and
I
got
the
sex
ed
talk
I
got
one
too.
What
the
fuck?
Go
look.
There's
a
broken
window
in
the
kitchen.
...
there's
no
one
there.
Are
you
sure?
Yeah.
I
mean
whoever
broke
it
Maybe
we
should
call
the
police.
I'm
going
to
wake
up
your
siser.
Jay.
Jan.
It's
in
the
house.
What's
going
on?
There's
nothing
in
the
house,
I
saw
it.
Open
the
door.
It's
in
the
kitchen.
I'm
not
going
to
let
anything
Open
the
door,
There's
nothing
out
here.
Okay.
Jay,
why
don't
you
sit
down.
I
need
water.
Oh,
I
got
to
need
water.
Okay,
I'll
get
you
some.
No,
stay
here!
Is
something
wrong
with
me?
Look,
somebody
broke
the
window,
That
really
happened.
But
I
saw
a
girl
in
the
kitchen.
Jay.
I
love
you.
You're
okay.
You
don't
believe
me.
Mom?
Mom,
is
that
you?
No,
it's
me.
Yara?
Yeah.
Don't
open
the
door.
See.
Oh...!
God...!
Wait.
Jay.
What
are
you
doing?
Hey,
Jay.
Jay!
Jay!
You
could've
hurt
yourself.
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
scared.
Me
too.
We
will
figure
it
out.
You
can't
tell
mom.
And
she'll
freaked
out.
I
know.
What
are
you
running
from?
Do
you
see
that?
I
do.
It's...
Greg?
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
Someone
broke
into
their
house.
Shit.
Did
you
call
the
police?
I
don't
want
to
go
home.
Where
you
want
to
go?
I...
I
need
to
find
him.
The
person
who
broke
into
your
house?
No.
Hugh?
What
did
he
really
do
to
you?
Okay.
Are
you
leaving?
No,
I'm...
Someone's
got
to
drive.
right?
God.
Hey,
What?
Is
this
him?

No.
Hello?
Hi

Yeah,

Yeah.
Your
friends?
Okay,
I
can
still
see
it.
It's
not
done
with
me
either.
LIke
I
told
you.
All
you
can
do
is
pass
it
on
What
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about?
She
can
do
the
same
thing
I
did.
It
should
be
easier
for
her,
Any
guy
would
be
with
you.
Just
sleep
with
someone
else
and
Maybe
it'll
never
come
back.
This
isn't
real.
I
swear
to
you.
Look.
We
shouldn't
even
be
in
the
same
place.
I'm
sorry,
your
guys
need
Hey.
Watch
it.
If
it
kills
her.
It
goes
straight
down
the
line,
Jay.
I'm
sorry.
I
wasn't
trying
to
hurt
you,
Someone
did
this
to
me
too.
Who
did
this
to
you?
I
met
a
girl
at
the
bar.
Its
a
one
night
stand.
I
think
that's
where
it
came
from.
Jeff.
She
might.
But
I
think
you're
a
fucking
liar.
What
you're
doing
to
Do
you
guys
see
that
girl
-
Yeah.
-
Uh
huh.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Jay,
Wherever
you
are?
If
someone
walking
But
it
is
walking.
If
you
try
falling
off.
Decide
if
you
want
to
give
to
someone
else.
Um.
Yeah.
Your
mom
is
not
going
to
freak
out?
She
won't
even
know.
It's
really
nice
of
you.
I
love
coming
up
here.
My
dad,
He
used
to
take
me
hunting
It's
not
like
super
nice,
It's
cool.
Have
you
thought
about
what
he
said?
What?
Maybe
passing
it
on?
I
don't
know.
Still
like
sticking
around
when
It's
been
lonely.
I'm
right
across
the
street
you
know.
I
remember.
I
guess
I
should've
been
nicer
to
you.
You
guys
should
get
into
the
water.
You
want
to?
Maybe
a
little
bit.
Come
on.
Oh.
Oh
my
God!
Jay,
Please
help!
Help
me!
What
are
you
doing?
Jay,
Stop
shooting!
-
What
the
hell
are
you
guys
doing?
What
did
you
do
to
the
door?
It's
trying
to
come
in.
There's
nothing
out
here.
Yes,
there
is.
Fucking
son
of
a...
Greg?
Greg,
Greg?
Jay,
Wait!
Where
the
hell
is
my
fucking
car?
Have
you
seen
it?
Nothing.
I'm
waiting,
It's
been
3
days.
You
believe
me,
Not
just
playing
along?
No,
I...
I...I
believe
you.
I
just
don't
think
it's
following
me.
Isn't
that
a
good
thing?
Yeah.
Hey.
How
are
you
guys?
Okay.
How's
uh...
Not
great.
You
seen
anything?
No.
Is
it...
I
don't
think
so.
She
doesn't
want
She
is
just
hiding
in
there.
Glad
she's
doing
better.
I
can
have
her
call
you
later.
Yeah.
Okay.
You
really
haven't
seen
anything?
Nope.
She
didn't
make
it
up.
I'll
know
sooner
or
later
That
chair
broke
in
mid
air.
I
mean
something
knocked
me
over
and
Look,
something
happened,
What
do
you
think
it
was
then?
I'll
see
you
guys.
-
Bye,
Greg.
Hi,
this
is
Greg.
Greg!
Greg,
Greg,
don't
open
the
door!
What
the
fuck,
Who
is
it?
Paul.
Hang
on.
It's
going
to
be
here
You
could
You
did
once.
Shouldn't
have.
I
could.
No.
I
like
you
too.
Why
you
picked
Greg?
I
thought
he'll
be
okay.
He
wasn't
scared.
He
said
to
go
to
high
school
I
want
to
help.
Do
you?
Yeah.
Jay?
Yeah?
Do
you
trust
me?
Do
you
remember
where
we
were.
You
know
where
to
go?
I
know
how
to
go
I
haven't
been
to
the
pool
Who
brought
you
there?
Okay.
That's
where
I
had
my
first
beer.
-
In
the
pool?
And
in
the
car.
Paul
used
to
pee
in
it.
Eww...
Whatever.
When
I
was
a
little
girl.
My
parents
wouldn't
allow
me
And
I
didn't
even
know
what
that
meant,
And
I
started
realizing
that.
That's
where
the
city
started
and
And
I
used
to
think
about
I
mean.
I
had
to
ask
permission
with
my
best
friend
and
her
parents.
Only
because
it
was
a
few
My
mom
said
the
same
thing.
How
long
do
you
think
it'll
be?
I
don't
know.
Are
you
always
that
bad.
Oh
my
God.
It
just
walked
into
the
room.
It's
here?
Right
there!
Jay,
I
don't
want
to
tell
you.
Jay,
I
need
you
to
point
at
it.
Keep
your
finger
aim
at
it
Is
it
getting
in
the
water?
It's
just
standing
there,
It's
moving.
What's
it
doing?
It's
walking.
-
Paul,
I
want
to
get
out.
No,
I
don't
want
to
do
this,
-
What
the
fuck?
Out
out
of
there!
She's
going
to
get
electrocuted.
No,
it
didn't
working.
-
You
okay?
-
Didn't
work.
Jay,
-
Oh
my
god,
somebody
help
her.
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
Jay,
It's
right
there.
Where
is
it?
Watch
out,
It's
right
there.
Yara!
Where?
Here?
-
Here?
Where
is
it?
Jay!
-
Give
me
your
hand!
