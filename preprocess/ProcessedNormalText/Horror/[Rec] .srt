We'll

inside
look
Join

OK.
If
this
is
a
pain
in
the
ass,
I
don't
want
to
waste
the
tape.
Andreu,
you're
the
boss,
right?
The
organizer...
Yes,
I'm
in
charge
of
this
shift,
both
inside
the
fire
house
This
is
our
helmet.
You
can
put
it
on,
it's
clean.
I'm
going
to
be
the
heroine
of
Should
we
put
them
on?
It's
easy.
You're
all
so
huge,
We're
big,
yes.
Our
pants
are
inside
the
boots.
Like
in
the
cartoons,
right?
The
cartoons
copied
us,
I'm
a
firefighter.
Well,
let's
see
if...
-
if
there's
a
call.
Will
you
let
me
go
with
you?
-
Of
course.
-
It's
like
a
lottery.
A
lottery.
We
might
get
a
call,
We'll
see
if
we
do...
You'll
see,
I'll
help
you
out.
Perfect.
OK.
We're
going
to
the
dining
room.
-
Will
they
mind
if
I
come
in?
-
They
know
you're
here.
...that
delicious
food
-
Exactly.
Very
good.
Be
careful!
-
Let's
go
to
the
dining
room.
Hello.
-
Bon
appetit!
Enjoy
your
meal.
This
is
Manu
and
Alex,
Nice
to
meet
you.
Please,
We'll
accompany
you
tonight.
Finish
eating,
we'll
see
you
later.
-
Do
you
want
to
go
to
the
museum?
Turn
around.
I
think
I'll
put
it
Won't
it
bother
you
I
don't
think
so.
Here
you
have
to
do
everything.
-
Let's
see...
-
Say
something.
-
Hello,
hello...
A
little
more.
Hello,
my
name
is
Manu
and
-
We'll
have
fun...
I
don't
know.
-
Ready?
You
know
what?
-
Lf
you
don't
mind.
It's
my
hair.
So,
Alex,
tell
us
what
here
in
the
fire
house.
A
normal
night
-
Normal?
People
think
we
run
around
putting
out
fires,
but
around
70%
of
the
calls
we
get
are
for
other
types
of
services.
-
Like
what?
broken
water
mains,
or
pet
rescue,
too.
Even
though
it
sounds
cliche,
Or
to...
This
will
sound
terrible,
and
everyone
to
run
off.
-
I
don't
want
anything
to
happen.
I
mean,
just
to
go
with
you,
-
Don't
get
me
wrong.
-
It's
more
interesting
for
you.
It's
more
exciting...
That
everything
is
fine
-
A
routine
call,
right?
So,
that's
a
fireman's
life.
Waiting,
passing
time.
Watching
movies
-
In
the
living
room,
right
Alex?
OK.
I
can't
take
it.
What
should
we
do?
-
All
right.
We
should
do
something,
right?
How
exciting!
OK.
-
Hello.
Good
evening.
Finally!
Women
in
the
fire
station.
Where
are
you
going?
-
I'm
sorry...
Time's
going
by
and
it
gets
quieter.
The
dining
room
is
empty.
They're
clean.
Here
they're
sleeping.
When
the
alarm
rings,
they
jump
out
of
bed
and
slide
down
here.
The
fire
trucks
are
down
there.
We
saw
them
before.
It
takes
them
3
minutes
to
get
up.
-
We'll
finish
this
later.
Person
trapped
in

Bravo

What'll
we
do?
I

that
way.
Run.
It's
all
ready.
You

Alex
and
Manu
are
the
firemen

will
accompany
this
evening.
We're
going
to
follow
them,
it's
not
always
fires
because
the
entire
team
goes
out.
Even
if
it's
stopping
a
water
leak,
or
helping
someone
or
a
fire...
Don't
you
put
on
the...
what's
it
called...
the
alarm?
We
don't
normally
use
it
because
it's
not
urgent.
But
if
you
want,
-
What
do
you
think?
No?
Well...
What's
your
show
called?
"While
you're
asleep".
"While
you're
asleep"?
We
have
to
do
another
take.
Did
it
make
sense?
-
Ready?
Come
on.
Let's
go.
-
What
are
you
taking
with
you?
here
in
this
case,

locks
and
doors.
We're

with
Alex
and
Manu.
We're
almost
at
the
house
that
called
for
help.
The
police
are
here.
We
can
see
a
police
car.
Maybe
it's
more
serious
-
We'll
find
out
soon.
Let's
go
in.
Good

Don't
worry.
Awoman
was
screaming.
We
were

Please

It

I
heard
screams
Let's

A
BNC
protocol
situation
Shortly
a
health
inspector
Thank
you
for
your
cooperation.
Why
are
we
locked
in
here?
And
what
do
they
mean
-
I
don't
know.
What's
an
BNC
protocol?
It's
a
proceedure
used
in
Biological,
Nuclear,
What?
Nuclear?
It's
more
usual
than
you
think.
The
wounded
are
stable,
-
We
have
to
get
them
out
of
here.
So,
Ladies,
Gentlemen,
No!
There's
something
more
Our
cells
don't
work.
-
We're
isolated.
Why?
I
can't
get
through
-
And
my
daughter
has
a
high
fever.
She
has
tonsilitis.
-
She's
burning
up.
From
the
office
I'm
going
with
you.
Where
are
you
going?

Are
you
sure?
How
are
we
going
to
get
in?
What?
The
concierge
has
a
copy
of
the
key.
I
gave
it
to
him.
Let's
go.
There
was
someone
else
What
do
you
mean
someone
else?
I
don't
know.
A
girl.
Probably
the
Colombian
girl.
She's
dead.
Let's
go.
Open
it,
quick!
This
way.
It's
this
way.
Let's
go.
Help
me.
Fuck...
Go
back
immediately,
No,
listen!
Get
back.
We're
sealing
off
the
building.
-
Ready
up
there?
Go
ahead.
Listen
to
me!
Listen!
Can
you
see
me?
Can
you
hear
me?
What
are
you
doing
there?
Remember
I'm
still
in
charge.
-
You
knew
about
this,
didn't
you?
That
they're
sealing
us
in.
Step
back!
-
What
the
hell
is
this?
I
don't
know!
-
I
repeat,
step
back!
-
Why?
We
have
to
show
-
Don't
you
get
it?
It's
the
only
proof
we
have.
You're
locked
in
herejust
like
us.
Shut
up!
Please,
go
down
to
the
workshop.
-
Let's
all
calm
down.
Yes,
we're
going.
Put
the
gun
down.
Remain
calm.
We
apologize
for
the
inconvenience.
It
is
of
utmost
importance
that
you
follow
the
agent's
He
is
in
the
building
with
you.
Do
not
try
to
leave
the
building.
I
repeat,
do
not
try
Hold
this.
Relax,
man...
Let's
go
with
the
others.
I'm
really
sorry.
Please,
go
downstairs.
-
Let's
go.
Let
me
go
up
to
my
apartment.
I
have
sutures
and
bandages...
Yes...
It's
nearly
2
a.
m.
And
we're

to
with
the
firemen
to
assist
an
elderly
lady
and
a
fireman.
They're
both
The
police
won't
let
us
leave
The
neighbors
are
scared
to
death.
They

an
intern.
I
give
shots,
take
people's
blood
pressure.
Well,
the
injured
are
This
is
very
serious.
The
police
have
several
bite
wounds.
He's
very
injured.
What's
obvious
is
that
Mrs.
Izquierdo
attacked
I
guess
she
had
a
fit
of
hysteria.
But
honestly,
it's
hard
to
believe.
That...
an
old
lady
could
do
I
guess
when
the
doctor
arrives,
apart
from
bringing
supplies
he'll
tell
us
what's
going
on.
We're
locked
in
here,
the
police

have
no
explanations.
and
we
have
to
get

what's
happened
this
evening,

can't
say
too
much
because
I
heard
loud
screams.
Of
course
I
woke
him
up,
and
came
down
here.
I
have
to
change
my
clothes,
Something
strange
is
going
on.
Someone

he
here?
He's
at
the
vet.
-
What's
wrong
with
him?
I
knew
something
would
happen
A
fire
or
something
serious.
There
must
be
something
upstairs.
If
not,
I
don't
get
why
people
they
fall
down
through
I
can't
go
up
to
my
house.
So,
here
we
are.
I
am
going
to
sue.
I
am
definitely
going
to
sue.
I'm
going
to
call
the
newspapers,
and
have
them
write
From
the
beginning
until
the
very
end.
-
Cesar?
Hi.
Sorry,
but
could
I
ask
you
Wait...
OK,
yes.
We
want
to
cover
the
story.
-
Are
you
recording
already?
-
OK,
rolling.
If
you
prefer
Have
you
lived
here
for
long?
Yes,
I
used
to
live
with
my
mom.
It's
the
Chinese.
They
eat
raw.
Raw
fish.
It
smells...
They
always
leave
the
door
open.
I
don't
know
why.
I
mean,
if
they
were
the
nice
kind
and
cool
stuff...
But
no.
They
come
in
and
out
screaming
in
Japanese,
I
don't
know.
When
are
we
starting?
-
We
did.
Don't
you
see
my
face
is
shiny?
I
think
this
profile's
better,
right?
-
Yes.
Great.
Good.
OK,
silence
please.
Silence.
Ma'am.
-
I
just
spoke
to
them
outside.
They
told
me
the
health
inspector
-
Health
inspector?
There
is
a
possible
infection
An
infection?
Yes,
but
please
calm
down.
They're
just
going
to
take
of
all
the
residents
-
Only
of
the
residents?
When
they
see
everything's
OK,
they'll
let
us
out.
Great.
We
ask
you
to
cooperate.
We're
going
to
check
if
everyone
is
here.
A
simple
"here"will
be
fine,
OK?
Let's
start.
The
main
floor
on
the
left
Who
lives
in
the
apartment
That's
the
Colombian
girl's
apartment.
First
floor,
right...
That's
where
Mrs.
Izquierdo
-
First
floor,
left?
Me,
my
daughter
and
my
husband
Yes,
we
know,
lady.
Calm
down.

Second
floor,

You?

No,
we

You

Your
father?

Where
is
he?
My
father
sick.
What
she
means
is
-
Exactly,
my
father
is
sick.
Listen
up!
We're
going
to
finish.
Does
anyone
live
in
the
penthouse?
No,
nobody
lives
there.
A
man
from
Madrid
owns
it,
It's
been
closed
up
for
years.
Excuse
me?
-
My
father
come
down,
yes?
what
if
he's
the
cause
of
all
this.
My
father's
sick!
-
He
has
to
come
down
here
with
us.
Be
respectful.
Calm
down.
Your
child
is
sick
too
and...
My
daughter
has
tonsilitis!
Nobody
move
until
the
doctor
says
so.
We're
going
in.
Wait.
Go
ahead,
341.
OK,
over.
What's
this?
They'll
keep
telling
us
Pablo,
I'm
going
in.
-
OK.
As
we
were
told,
the
health
inspector
There
are
incredible
We
know
nothing,
they
haven't
told
us
a
thing.
We
saw
Special
Forces,
wearing
suits
and
masks
and
it's
not
very
comforting.
That's
all
we
know.
Take
me
to
them.
What
is
a
TV
crew
doing
here?
Jennifer!
Don't
touch
that.
-
Why?
Pablo,
can
you
come
here?
Thanks.
Don't
you
think
this
inspection
I
don't
know.
The
policeman
and
the
fireman
If
it's
contagious,
they
could
react
Don't
scare
me...
Fuck,
what
a
day.
Pablo,
grab
the
camera.
It's
recording...
Someone's
been
messing
around
here.
It
doesn't
matter.
Shit!
Come
here.
There.
Look.
Hold
this.
Be
careful,
Pablo.
Give
it
to
me.
Can
you
see
anything?
What
can
you
see?
-
They're
handcuffing
him.
Pablo,
what
can
you
see?
Tell
me
what
you
see!
Say
something!
-
What
are
they
saying?
-
What's
that?
I
don't
know.
The
doctor
-
It's
a
needle.
-
I
don't
know.
Wait.
They're
injecting
the
fireman
Pablo!
More
handcuffs.
-
Holy
shit!
Shit!
What's
that,
Pablo?
Say
something!
Why
are
they
screaming?
Pablo,
answer
me!
Go,
go.
Run!
-
What's
going
on
in
there?
What's
going
on?
What
are
you
doing?
Guillem's
still
in
there!
He
got
bitten,
we
can't
let
him
out.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
It
spreads
through
saliva.
We
can't
risk
letting
him
out.
We
don't
know
if
he's
been
bitten!
The
infected
ones
are
handcuffed.
Just
stay
away
from
them.
Infected
with
what?
-
What's
going
on?
What
the
fuck
is
all
this
about?
The
reaction
time
depends
Fuck!
Hurry
up!
Run!
Come
on,
hurry
up!
Now
tell
us
-
I'm
not
authorized...
I
just
killed
a
cop
Tell
us
everything
you
know.
OK.
Yesterday
we
received
a
call
from
a
vet
who
had
a
dog
brought
in
The
dog
went
into
a
coma
and
a
few
moments
later
came
to
and
was
extraordinarily
aggressive.
He
started
attacking
all
of
We
had
to
give
him
and
then
put
him
to
sleep.
We
followed
the
chip
in
his
ear
-
Was
the
dog
called
Max?
She
only
has
tonsilitis.
-
Bullshit,
tonsilitis.
We
just
have
to
be
sure.
Calm
down.
It's
just
tonsilitis.
We
think
the
dog
spread
the
infection
through
his
saliva.
If
that's
true...
Handcuffs!
Get
the
handcuffs!
-
Hold
her!
Jennifer!
The
cuffs!
Jennifer!
Relax,
we'll
get
her.
Father
downstairs.
-
What
father?
And
you
didn't
tell
me?
We
can't
have
infected
people
We
gave
you
specific
orders
We
had
no
idea.
We
thought
Take
this.
Get
her
Everyone
must
come
down
here.
Get
this
on
tape!
Be
careful,
Pablo!
Jennifer?
What
the
hell
is
that?
Fucking
hell!
-
The
old
lady
isn't
there.
Jennifer?
Jennifer.
There's
no
one
here.
Wait.
She's
over
there.
Look!
Fuck!
Jennifer,
relax.
Relax.
Give
me
the
needle.
-
Are
you
sure?
Be
careful,
man.
Jennifer.
Relax.
Give
me
your
hand.
-
Be
careful.
What
happened
to
her
eyes?
Shit!
Be
careful!
Shit!
Get
out
of
the
way!
Go,
she
bit
me!
She
bit
me,
can't
you
see?
Go,
for
fuck's
sake!
Go!
Let's
go!
No
down!
Don't
go
down
there!
They're
getting
away!
Help
me!
Take
these
off
of
me!
-
Don't
touch
me!
Take
them
off!
I
don't
have
it.
I
don't
have
the
key!
What
do
you
mean?
-
The
policeman
has
it.
-
The
shutter!
Help!
Help,
you
bastard!
Don't
go!
Get
away!
We
have
to
get
her
out
of
here.
-
Let's
go.
I'm
sorry!
Don't
leave
me
here!
This
way,
come
on.
Hurry
up!
The
lock!
It
looks
like
they're
leaving.
They're
going
upstairs.
-
Were
you
bitten?
-
Angela?
-
You?
-
Did
you
find
the
little
girl?
It's
out
of
control.
Pablo,
what
the
hell
were
they
They
were
eating
her
alive,
Manu.
I
don't
know!
They
could
all
be
infected
by
now.
-
We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
No!
We
can
stay
here
until
they
come
to
get
us.
No
one's
going
to
come
get
us!
-
Yes!
They
don't
give
a
shit!
But
the
doctor
-
They'll
come
get
the
doctor.
-
He
is
in
there.
-
Where?
I'm
gonna
kill
you!
I've
been
bitten.
Go
away.
Get
lost.
I've
been
bitten!
Get
back!
Go
away!
Shit,
shit...
The
door
won't
hold.
-
Go
away.
Get
us
out
of
here!
Stand
away
from
the
windows!
We
repeat:
or
we
will
be
forced
Follow
the
inspector's
There
might
be
a
way
out.
Pablo,
there
might
be
a
way
out!
Listen!
There's
an
underground
storage
that
has
a
drain
cover
that
joins
Can
you
hear
me?
-
In
the
workshop
there's
a
basement...
Yes,
we
can
escape
through
there.
-
How
the
hell
will
we
open
it?
The
intern
is
in
charge.
-
Where?
Let's
go!
Let's
go!
He's
been
bitten!
Hurry
up!
They're
not
there.
Manu,
we
have
to
find
the
way
out.
Yeah,
but...
how?
The
intern
has
the
key,
You
checked
the
list!
-
I
can't
remember.
I
don't
remember
either.
Manu,
think.
-
I
can't
remember!
Guillem!
The
mailboxes!
He's
called
Guillem...
Downstairs,
quick!
Hurry
up!
Guillem
Marimn,
third
floor

She's
cuffed.
We
have
to
go
upstairs.
Upstairs!
Be
careful,
Angela!
Pablo,
help
me!
Wait.
OK.
Drop
her.
-
I
got
bitten!
I
saw
it.
You
didn't.
Let's
go
upstairs.
-
Come

get
up.
You
did
not,
Angela.
Let's
go,
Pablo!
Hurry
up!
Hurry
up!
Shit!

The
light!

On
the
wall!

Pablo,
the
spotlight!
Turn
it
on!
Quickly!
Move
it!
Move
it!
Shit!
Go
upstairs,
hurry!
The
mallet,
Angela!
Go
upstairs,
quickly!
It's
here.
Move.
Hurry
up.
I'll
wait
here.
I'll
go
there.
Where
are
they?
Look
in
the
drawers.
Where
the
hell
are
they?
We
have
to
get
out.
-
Here,
here!
Shit!
The
keys...
Where
are...
The
keys!
Which
ones
are
they?
Which
ones
are
they?
I
don't
know.
Grab
them
all.
Let's
go.
Where's
Manu?
Upstairs,
run!
Go
to
the
penthouse!
Come
on,
Angela!
Which
one
is
it?
This
one!
-
Turn
on
the
spotlight.
-
The
light
is
loose.
I'm
trying!
They're
leaving.
-
Pablo,
turn
it
on!
This
is
the
apartment
-
No
one
will
be
in
here.
OK.
-
Where
are
we?
What
the
hell
is
all
this?
Pablo,
over
here.
Where?
Holy
shit!
-
What
does
this
mean?
-
Pablo!
"The
Vatican
is
investigating...
the
possible
possession
PORTUGAL
IS
MOVED
BY
-
Fuck...
THE
MEDEIROS
CASE
ON
HOLD
Pablo,
look!
It's
the
same
girl!
What
the
hell
is
this?
It's
all
about
the
same.
"The
hospital
denies
releasing
Pablo!
Calm
down.
It
must
be
the
pipes.
Calm
down,
we'll
find
a
way
out.
We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
Be
careful.
Stay
close.
Didn't
they
say
no
one
lived
here?
Calm
down.
Pablo.
Over
here.
What's
that?
They're
still
talking
about
the
same.
What
the
hell
is
this?
-
Angela,
let's
go.
It
must
have
something
Look!
A
tape
recorder.
-
There's
no
electricity.
There.
I've
finally
isolated
the
enzyme.
The
problem
is
that
it's
unstable.
It
deteriorates
when
it
I
am,
however,
optmistic.
If
all
goes
well
The
analyses
were
successful.
What
the
hell
is
he
talking
about?
Something
unexpected
has
happened.
The
enzyme
is
not
only
resistant
It
behaves
much
like
the
flu.
This
leads
us
It
might
be
contagious.
I
don't
get
it.
The
telegram
from
Rome
The
Medeiros
girl
He's
talking
about
the
girl,
Pablo.
She
was
here.
I
must
eliminate
her
and
erase
What
the
hell
is
this
guy
saying?
Finally
my
prayers
We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
This
decision
should
This
has
all
been
a
big
mistake.
I
must
follow
the
procedures.
The
ritual
is
very
specific.
Come
here.
Stay
close.
I'm
going
to
seal
off
the
room.
The
seal
should
keep
her
in.
If
anything
goes
wrong,
Wait.
-
I'm
going
to
look.
There
might
be
a
way
out
-
We
have
to
give
it
a
try.
I'll
record
what's
up
there
Pablo.
Bring
the
camera
down.
There
are
really
weird
noises.
-
What
happened?
Turn
it
on.
The
fucking
light
broke!
-
Turn
it
on,
Pablo!
-
Fuck!
What
now?
I'll
turn
on
the
night
vision.
OK,
I
can
see
you
now.
That's
good.
Stick
your
hand
out.
-
I
can't
see
you.
Where
are
you?
Relax,
it's
me.
I
can
see
if
I
use
the
camera.
Get
behind
me
and
don't
let
go.
We'll
be
OK.
I'll
find
the
way
out.
Don't
let
go,
OK?
-
Stay
still.
There's
something.
Don't
make
a
sound.
Get
down.
Keep
quiet,
for
God's
sake!
It
can't
see
us.
Let's
go.
-
Run!
Run!
Answer
me!
Pablo.
We
have
to
tape
everything,
Pablo.
