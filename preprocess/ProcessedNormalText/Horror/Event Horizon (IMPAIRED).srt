We
are
prepped
for
lockdown.
I
can't
believe
it,
this
is
ridiculous.
I
haven't
got
more
than
my
hand
I
mean,
-
I
mean,
Mars
has
got
women.
Neptune,
there's
nothing
out
there.
Yeah,
and
if
the
shit
goes
down,
You
know
the
rules,
people.
Someone
drops
the
ball,
we
get
the
call.
-
Have
you
got
our
course
plotted
in?
-
Locked
and
cocked
and
ready
to
rock.
Everything's
green
on
my

Start
your

Thank
you,

Captain
Miller,

Doctor.
You
waiting
for
a
personal
invitation,
-
No,
sir.
Doctor,
if
you'll
just
follow
we're
almost
underway.
That
bunk
better
be
squared
away,
or
you'll
find
yourself
walking
What's
the

Peters?

You

here.
Thanks,

First

Uh-huh.
I
think
your
captain
Oh,
well.
Don't
worry
about
him.
He
just
loves
having
complete
strangers
-
D.J.
No.
Is
this
necessary?
When
the

Without
a

I've
seen
the

on

Claustrophobic?
Very.
CLAIRE:
Billy.
CLAIRE:
I'm
so
alone.
Hello?
Is
anyone
there?
Oh,
God.
Billy?
I'm
so
cold.
Claire.
I'm
waiting.

You're
all
right.
Breathe.
D.J.!
-
Okay,
Dr
Weir,
let's
get
you
up.
-
Come
on,
take
it
easy.
Okay.
There
you
go.
Now
move
nice
and
slow.
You're
gonna
experience
-
I'm
all
right
now,
thank
you.
All
yours.
You
okay,
Doc?
-
Want
some
coffee?
Would
you
like
some
coffee?
No.
Thank
you.
All
right,
suit
yourself.
What
about
you,
Starck?
Would
you
like
-

Is
that
an
offer?
-
Then
how
about
some
coffee?
-
Yes,
sir.
Do
you
mind
if
I
get
dressed
first?
As
a
matter
of
fact,
Lieutenant,
Let's
go,
people.
We
have
a
job
to
do.
PETERS:
Okay,
Denny,

we
go.
Play

Play

Hey,
no

You're

Yo,

All
right.

Peters.
I
did
try
to
find
a
replacement
for
you,
but
with
such
short
notice,
I
am
sorry.
I
talked
to
my
ex.
I'll
get
him
for
the

so
everything's
all
right.

First
of

this

I...
that
you

We
were

sent
into

We

What
it
does
is
that

it
to

How?
-
Well,
it's
difficult
to...
It's
all

Well,
I
can
see
why

We've

What

Okay,
how

His

I

I

In

But
maybe
he

by

"An

Where

It

son
lying
on
the
examination
table
-
and
in
his
legs
were...
-
...crawling...
it
sounds
a
little
like
shock.
-
Could
it
be
that
you're
traumatised...
-
...by
seeing
the
body
on
the...
I've
seen
bodies
before.
She's
right.
Now,
this
was
real.
I
felt...
I
felt
heat.
This
is
not
something
Smitty,
have
you
seen
anything
unusual
No,
I
haven't
seen
anything,
but
I
can
tell
you
this
ship
is
fucked.
Thank
you
for
that
scientific
analysis,
Well,
you
don't
expect
All
right,
Doc.
When
you
break
you
seriously
think
You
already
killed
the
last
fucking
crew.
-
It's
just
a
fucking
ship,
all
right?
It's
just
a
ship,
do
you
understand?
-
There's
nothing
odd
going
on.
-
Fine.
-
You
all
right?
I'm
sorry.
-
Damn
it!
-
It's
all
right.
That's
it.
That's
enough!
I
want
you
calm,
-
All
right.
You're
going
outside
on
the
Clark
and
you're
going
to
repair
the
ship.
Mistakes,
nobody
goes
home.
-
Yes,
sir.
-
Sir.
-
Miller.
I
ran
the
bio-scan
The
results
were
bio
readings...
Of
an
indeterminate
origin.
Yes,
I
know.
Don't
you
have
anything
useful
-
I've
got
a
theory.
I
think
that
there's
a
connection
between
like
they're
all
part
some
sort
of
immune
system.
I
don't
have
time
to
listen
to
this.
-
You
have
to
listen
to
me.
I'm
saying
that
this
ship
is
reacting
to
us
It's
as
if
the
ship
a
life
force
of
some
kind.
What
are
you
telling
me?
You
wanted
an
answer,
No,
what
I
want,
Lieutenant,
Justin?
Justin!
Justin!

Did
you
hear
that?
Did
you
hear
that?
-
What's
that?
-
You
heard
it.
-
What
is
it?
It's
D.J.,
all
right?
I
didn't
hear
anything.
-
So
just
calm
down,
all
right?
-
Get
your
breath
back.
-
Now,
tell
me.

Make
it
stop!
Make
it
stop!
Open
the
door.
Stop
moving!
-
No!
What're
you
doing?
In
our
current
environment,
Dr
Weir,

What
is
it?
The
forward
airlock.
Miller,
Smith,
Cooper,
MILLER:
That's
a
negative,
Starck.
Justin.
-
Justin.
Justin,
no!
Justin,
no!
Justin,
open
the
door.
Miller,
come
in.
Miller,
come
in.
We
have
an
emergency.
What's
going
on
in
there,
Starck?
-
Justin's
in
the
airlock.
Justin
is
in
the
airlock
-
Shit.
I'm
on
it.
-
Skipper,
you
need
me
on
this.
He's
engaged
the
override.
-
Can
you
shut
it
down?
Coming
to
him,
Starck.
Justin!
Open
this
door,
now!
Starck,
give
me
status.
You
better
hurry.
-
and
we
can't
open
the
inner
door.
Justin,
open
the
door!
Justin,
open
the
door.
-
Did
you
hear
it?
Yes.
Yes,
I
heard
it.
It
shows
you
things,
-
horrible
things.
The
dark
inside
me
-
I
won't
go
back
there.
I
won't.
-
Come
on,
open
the
door.
-
I
don't
think
she
can
talk
him
down.
If
he
opens
the
airlock,
-
No.
You
stay
with
me.
-
I've
almost
got
it.
Come
on,
now.
Open
that
door!
If
you
could
see
the
things
I've
seen,
No,
that's
not
you
talking.
That's
it.
That's
it,
right
there.
Open
the
door.
Go
for
that
button.
Okay.
No!
Captain,
Justin
just
activated
the
door.
Justin!
WOMAN
OVER
PA:
Stand
by
Where
am
I?
-
Hey.
-
Hey,
open
the
door.
The
inner
door
won't
open
-
It'd
decompress
the
entire
ship.
Mama
Bear,
open
the
door.
Come
on,
please.
-
Captain!
Captain
Miller,
tell
them
They
can't
do
that,
Justin.
-
I
don't
want
to
die
in
here.
I
want
you
to
listen
to
me
very
carefully,
Oh,
my
God.
It's
starting.
-
My
eyes.
Just
shut
them
as
tight
as
you
can.
Five
seconds.
Tuck
yourself
into
a
crouch
position.
JUSTIN:
I
can't
breathe.
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God,
it
hurts.
I
want
you
to
huff
and
puff
Do
you
hear
me?

Do
it,
now!
Okay,
Baby
Bear.
Got
him.
I
got
him.
Stand
by,
people.
Stand
by.
-
We've
got
pressure.
I'm
going
to
need
five
units
here.
Okay.
Give
me
some
more
glycerin,
now.
D.J.:
One
thing
at
a
time,
STARCK:
Christ,
he's
bleeding
out.
-
Pressure's
still
dropping.
I've
stopped
the
bleeding,
He
won't
be
pretty,
but
he
should
live
-
if
we
make
it
back.
Starck,
what's
our
time
like?
CO2
levels
will
become
toxic
All
right.
Peters,
we've
got
to
find
out
before
the
same
thing
happens
to
us.
I
can
work
on
the
log
on
the
bridge,
-
Fine.
Justin
said
something
about,
"the
dark
inside
me."
What's
that
mean?
Doctor?
I
don't
think
it
means
anything.
Don't
you
walk
away
from
me,
mister.
I'd
like
some
answers,
Doctor.
I'd
like
to
know
why
one
of
my
men
by
throwing
himself
out
of
an
airlock.
Look,
thermal
changes
in
the
hull
could've
caused
the
metal
causing
reverberations.
Bullshit!
You
built
this
fucking
ship.
What
do
you
want
me
to
say?
You
said
the
ship's
drive
-
Yeah.
-
I
don't
know.
-
Where
did
you
send
it?
Where
has
it
been
Look,
I
don't
know.
"I
don't
know,"
You're
supposed
to
be
I
need
answers.
That's
your
job.
-
Now,
the
other
place,
where
is
that?
Look,
there's
a
lot
of
things
that
I
don't
fully
understand.
I
need
time.
I
see.
Well,
that's
exactly
CORRICK:
Captain!
Don't
leave
me!
Don't
leave
me!
Please!
For
God's
sakes,
help
me!
It's
in
your
head.
It's
just
in
your
head.

God
help
us.
I'm
telling
you,
it
was
his
voice
I
heard.
He
was
calling
to
me.
We
served
on
the
Goliath
together.
When
the
O2
tanks
ruptured,
But
Corrick
was
still
on
board
You
ever
seen
fire
in
zero
gravity?
It's
beautiful.
It's
like
liquid.
It
slides
all
over
everything.
Comes
up
in
waves.
And
they
just
kept
hitting
him,
wave
after
wave.
He
was
screaming
for
me
to
save
him.
What
did
you
do?
I
did
the
only
thing
I
could.
I
closed
the
lifeboat
hatch,
I
swore
I'd
never
lose
another
man.
I've
known
you
a
long
time.
-
You
never
told
me
that.
But
this
ship
knew
about
it.
It
knows
my
fears.
It
knows
my
secrets.
Gets
inside
your
head,
I
wasn't
going
to
tell
you
this.
I've
been
listening
to
the
distress
signal.
And
I...
I
think
I
made
a
mistake

Go
on.
I
thought
it
said
"liberate
me."
Save
me.
But
it's
not
"me."
It's
"liberate
tutume."
Save
yourself.
And
it
gets
worse.

There.
I
think,
that
says
"ex
inferis."
"Save
yourself,
"from
hell."
Look,
if
what
Dr
Weir
tells
us
is
true,
this
ship
has
been
beyond
of
known
scientific
reality.
Who
knows
where
it's
been,
what
it's
seen,
and
what
it's
brought
back
with
it.
From
hell.
You
don't
believe
in
that
kind
of
stuff,
Whoever
sent
that
message,
COOPER:
Captain
Miller.
Whatever
it
is,
Coop,
it
better
be
good.
Yes,
sir.
Ready
to
pressurise
the
Clark
On
my
way.
Come
on,
baby,
don't
let
me
down.
Hello,
baby.
Papa's
home.
SMITH:
She's
holding.
Oh,
shit.
Skipper,
we're
still
venting
Give
me
about
20
minutes
Cooper,
you
are
the
lifesaver.
Shit.
-
Got
any
coffee?
Great.

Starck.
Miller?
Liberate
tutemet
ex
inferis.
We're
leaving.
No,
we
can't
leave.
Our
orders
are
specific.
Rescue
the
crew,
The
crew
is
dead,
Doctor.
-
We
came
here
to
do
a
job.
Starck,
download
the
files
D.J.,
I
want
you
to
get
Justin
prepped
and
ready
to
move
him
back
There's
stuff
I
wanna
get
from
medical.
No
problem.
Do
it.
-
Peters.
I
want
you
to
get
the
CO2
scrubbers
-
Take
Smitty
with
you.
Captain.
Captain.
-
Don't
do
this.
What
about
my
ship?
I
have
no
intention
of
leaving
her,
I
will
take
the
Lewis
&
Clark
and
then
I
will
launch
tac
missiles
until
I'm
satisfied
she's
vapourised.
Captain
Miller,
It
looks
like
the
core
is
draining
power
Get
the
files.
Vacate.
You
can't
leave.
She
won't
let
you.
You
just
get
your
gear
and
get
back
or
you'll
find
yourself
walking
home.
I
am
home.
Let's
go!
Ready?
Shot.
Come
on.
-
Ready?
-
Shot.
Peters,
can
we
go?
Yeah,
you
wanna
breathe
-
No,
I
don't!
Let's
go!
-
25.
-
We
need
25.
Come
on!
Got
it!


Oh,
no.
Peters.
Oh,
God.
CLAIRE:
Billy.
Claire?
Claire.
It's
me.
I'm
home.
I'm
home.
I
know
I
wasn't
there
and
I'm
sorry
I...
I
let
my
work
come
between
us.
God,
Claire,
no.
I'm
begging
you,
please.
Please,
don't.
Not
again,
please.
I've
been
so...
I've
been
so...
Billy.
It's
all
right.
-
I've
been
so
alone.
You're
with
me
now.
You're
with
me
and
I
have
such
wonderful,
to
show
you.

Damn,
I'm
good.
Coop.
'Cause
I've
got
to
get
Look,
you
can
kiss
my
ass,
Smith,
Just
give
me
a
second
and
we
can
get
out
of
Dodge.
-
Two
minutes
tops.

Weir.
Dr
Weir.
Weir!
Weir!
Dr
Weir,
Weir!
Shit.
Captain
Miller,
Captain
Miller.
Go
ahead,
Smitty.
I've
just
seen
Weir
Stand
by,
Smitty,
-
Smith,
get
out
of
there.
One
of
the
explosives
is
missing
-
Weir
might
have
put
it
on
the
Clark.
No,
sir,
no
way.
Get
off
the
Clark
now,
Smith!
Where
the
fucking
hell
are
you?
Got
you.
Hang
on,
Smitty.
I'm
coming!
No!
Shit!
Shit!
Where
the
fuck
am
I
going?
Why
does
this
shit
got
to
happen
to
me?
All
right,
think,
Coop.
Think.
Think.
All
right,
I
got
to
get
back
to
the
ship.
I
gotta
blow
my
air
tank.
All
right.
Fuck.
This
better
work.
This
shit
better
work.
Here
I
go.
All
right.
Come
on.
Yes!
Here
I
come,
motherfuckers!
D.J.
-
What
was
that?
-
Smitty
and
Cooper
are
dead.
It
was
Weir.
Understood.
-
Be
careful,
D.J.
I'll
take
care
of
him.

D.J.?
MILLER:
D.J.?
D.J.,
answer
me!


Okay,
Dr
Weir.
You
don't
wanna
leave
your
ship?

You
never
will.


Starck.
It's
okay.
I'm
gonna
get
you
out
of
here.
Okay.
Easy.
Oh,
my
God.
What
happened
to
your
eyes?
Where
we're
going,
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
created
the
Event
Horizon
But
she's
gone
She
tore
a
hole
in
our
universe,
a
gateway
to
another
dimension.
A
dimension
of
pure
chaos,
pure
evil.
When
she
crossed
over,
But
when
she
came
back,
she
was
alive.
Look
at
her,
Miller.
Isn't
she
beautiful?
Your
beautiful
ship
Well,
now
she
has
another
crew.
Now
she
has
us.
What
do
you
think
you're
doing,
Doctor?
You
wanted
to
know
where
the
ship
so
now
you'll
find
out.
-
If
you
miss
me,
you
blow
out
the
hull.
That's
right,
I'm
back!
I'm...
Shit,
I
can't
stop.
Hey!
Hey!
Fuck.
What?
Who
the
fuck?
Oh,
shit!


Miller!
Miller!

Give
me
your
hand!
-
Come
on!
I'm
not
leaving
you.

Forward
airlock.
It
can't
be
Weir.
I'm
not
taking
any
chances.
You
watch
your
back.
-
Yo!
Don't
hit
me.
Take
it
off!
Take
it
off!
-
I
can't
breathe.
I
can't
breathe.
-
You're
okay.
It's
over.
Weir's
activated
the
gravity
drive.
-
How?
The
bridge
is
gone.
You
think
you
can
shut
it
down
I
don't
know
the
process.
I
don't
want
to
go
-
I'd
rather
be
dead.
-
Okay,
we
blow
the
fucker
up.
Do
like
Weir
said.
Blow
the
corridor,
separate
us
from
the
rest
of
ship.
With
any
luck,
TDRS
will
pick
up
We
prep
the
gravity
couches,
and
stand
by
Meantime,
I'm
gonna
go
-
Skipper,
will
this
shit
work?
You
go
activate
the
emergency
beacon.
-
Yes,
sir.
You
stay
here.
Miller.
Close
this
door
behind
me,
Lieutenant.

She's

I
repeat,
we
are

Miller.
Miller,
can
you
hear
me?
We
have
to
get
out
of
here
now.

You
let
me
burn.
WOMAN
OVER

Miller.

You
left
me
behind.
No,
you're
not
Edmund
Corrick.
Weir?

The
ship
brought
me
back.
She
won't
let
anyone
leave.
Did
you
really
think
She's
defied
space
and
time.
She's
been
to
a
place
And
now,
-
it
is
time
to
go
back.
You
know
nothing.
Hell
is
only
a
word.
The
reality
is
much,
much
worse.
Now
let
me
show
you.
Help
me!
No!
No.
-
You
see?
They're
not
dead.
They're
not
dead.
Not
yet.

You
won't
take
my
crew.
They're
not
your
crew
any
more.
WOMAN
OVER

Take
me.
You
take
me.
You
leave
them
alone.
No.
There
is
no
escape.
The
gateway
is
open,
and
you
are
all
coming
with
me.
Do
you

Do
you
see?
Do
you
see?
Yes,
I
see.
No!
Miller.
MAN
ON
RADIO:
This
is
Rescue
One.
Approaching
the
wreckage
Prepare
to
board.
I'm
entering
the
grav
couch
bay.
It
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
damaged
There
appear
to
be
three
survivors:
Cooper,
Justin,
Lieutenant
Starck.
Justin
seems
to
have
suffered
but
he's
still
alive.
The
grav
couches
still
have
power.
I'm
opening
the
first
tank
now.
It's
all
right.
It's
okay.
-
You're
safe
now.
They're
fine.
They're
with
us.
They're
with
us.
-
Starck.
Starck.
-
Calm
down,
it's
me.
-
Starck.
-
It's
the
rescue
team.
-
I
got
you,
Starck.
I
got
you.
I
need
a
sedative
here,
now!
Starck,
it's
the
rescue
team.
We're
safe.
-
Okay,
okay,
I
need
it
now!
