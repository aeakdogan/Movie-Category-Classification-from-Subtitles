MAN:
Carl's
Jr.
has
this
$6
burger,
...so
you
think
...but
the
truth
is,
it
may
be
I
went
there
yesterday
By
golly,
those
suckers
When
I
got
home,
...but
that
doesn't
take
away
I
mean,
here's
a
guy
-...through
life
as
Carl
Junior,
right?
Like
he
can
never
get
out
of
the
shadow
Do
you
think
this
eating
has
to
do
That
you're
eating
yourself
-You
do
think
you
killed
her,
right?
She
called
out
to
you
-She
said
she
was
having
chest
pain.
-How
could
you
know
this?
But
she
was
always
calling
out
You
weren't
there.
How
could
-Doesn't
matter.
Stop
blaming
yourself.
If
you
don't,
you'll
eat
yourself
You're
looking
in
my
head!
-Don't
look
in
there.
BARRY:
It
wasn't
your
fault.

Jonesy?
Ah!
JONESY:
What's
that
you
say?
Are
you
going
deaf?
You
know.
SSDD.
Well,
yeah,
of
course.
Hey,
I
was
thinking
if
you
were
free
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's
been
a
long
time.
JONES:
I
gotta
go.
I
got
a
thing
here.
Yeah,
right.
See
you
Saturday.
So,
Mr.
Defuniak...
...do
you
know
we're
both
You're
from
Pittsfield.
Know
what
happens
to
scholarship
You
had
the
flu
that
day,
didn't
you,
You
missed
the
test.
And
since
you
were
3000
words
on
the
short-term
results
-Go
get
started.
Better
to
be
from
Pittsfield
Thank
you,
sir.
How
did
you
know?
Sometimes
I
just
know.

Hello.
This
probably
won't
work.
Never
start
like
that
with
a
car
salesman.
In
one
hour
I'm
showing
a
house
in
And
I
just
lost
my
damn
car
keys.
-That
takes
at
least
a
day.
Easy,
Trish.
Maybe
I
can
help.
-Did
I
say
my
name?
I
don't
remember--
Now,
let's
find
those
keys.
-Hey,
Rachel.
-I
looked
again.
I
couldn't
find
them.
You
had
the
coffee
in
your
hand,
...went
to
your
car,
-That
everything?
Look.
This
is
gonna
seem
weird,
but
You
bought
a
candy
bar
Mars
bar.
Yours,
right?
One
more
question.
If
I
find
your
keys,
West
Wharf?
6:30?
Best
fried
clams
in
the
state?
Sure.
Okay.
-That'd
be
nice.
So
you
got
here.
Coffee,
candy
and
aspirin,
And
that's
when...
...you
dropped
your
keys.
It's
just
luck,
is
all.
Thank
you.


-West
Wharf,
right?
Half
past
six?
Another
fuckarow.


-Jones.
-Hey,
Beaver.
Same
shit,
different
day.
-Wanna
talk?
-What's
up?
-Wait,
Jonesy?
-You
be
careful.
Wish
I
knew.
Oh,
my
gosh.
What
did
you
say?
I
didn't
say
anything.
Right.
Sorry.
Hey!
WOMAN:
-Oh,
my
God!

MAN:
Somebody
call
an
ambulance!
MAN:
I
looked
away
for
one
second.
WOMAN
1:
Careful,
careful.
WOMAN
1:
Seriously....
I
just
saw
him.
WOMAN
2:
WOMAN
1:
Clear!
No
good.
Flatline.
Clear!
-What
do
you
think?
Watch
out
for
Ister
Gay.


DEVLIN:
CLARENDON:
DEVLIN:
Just
go
up
to
the
cabin.
-Beaver,
I'm
going
in!

DEVLIN:
-Got
blown
last
night.
-First
time?
Met
some
lady
at
bingo,
went
back
-As
opposed
to
a
fuckarow.
Though
I've
had
perfectly
good
fuckarees
-Try
Viagra.
I'm
practically
I'm....
What
do
you
call
it?
Prag--
Prasmatic?
-You're
thinking
of
fourth
grade.
-You
haven't
tried
it,
have
you?
Drop
that
little
blue
bomb,
you're
hard
Twelve
hours?
I'm
talking
Yastrzemski.
Bingo?
Did
you
say
bingo,
-There's
trim
there.
I
thought
my
deal
was
pathetic.
-Ah!
JONES:
I'm
fine.
H,
you
been
thinking
Uh-huh.
Remember
we
were
gonna
-I
remember.
I
gotta
tell
you
something
weird.
The
night
I
got
hit,
I
was
standing
there
Just
like
he
was
that
day
He
was
calling
out
for
help
Then
he
looked
over
at
me.
And
he
motioned
for
me
You
believe
I
saw
him,
don't
you?
Yes,
sir,
I
do.
Duddits
loves
me,
I
know
that.
He
would
die
before
So
why
was
he
calling
me
Maybe
there's
more
to
the
story
-You
don't
know
shit.
I'll
name
it
after
we
come
up
-50
bucks.
In
the
movies,
when
people
...they
immediately
start
kissing
But
they
never
get
up
first,
take
a
leak
Which
is
pretty
much
necessary
What's
it
called
when
-You
mean
priapism.
Priapismic.
-Whatever!
It's
hard.
I
can
name
the
one
movie
where
they
-I'll
give
you
a
quarter.
-Promised
Land.
Meg
Ryan
and
what's
his
name?
-Kiefer.
So
Meg
Ryan
wakes
up
in
the
morning
And
he
says,
"What
cat?"
And
she
says,
That
will
be
50
small.
-Bullshit!
You
made
it
up.
You
can
have
that
priceless
piece
I'm
filing
that
in
the
"Who-gives-a-shit"

-What's
the
memory
warehouse?
-I
must've
forgot.
-Just
remind
me.
Don't
give
me
shit.
-Hasn't
that
place
been
condemned?
It's
so
crowded
I
throw
something
out
When
I
got
my
new
laptop
I
had
to
My
warehouse
was
washed
away
I
didn't
know
they
had
enough
beer.
Hey.
Hey,
hey.
Jonesy,
if
that
really
-...what
do
you
do
with
the
old
files?
-You
threw
out
the
"Blue
Bayou"
lyrics?
No,
if
I
really
can't
...I
sneak
it
back
to
an
office
Where
do
you
keep
He's
got
a
special
section
all
his
I
can't
stop
thinking
about
the
Duds
It's
this
place.
He's
all
around
here,
This
is
our
20th
year
coming
out
And
fuck
me,
Freddy,
Yeah.
Twenty
more.
Here's
to
Duddits...
...our
dreamcatcher.
Wish
he
was
here.
To
the
Duds.
-To
Douglas
Cavell.
Why
is
Tina
Schlossinger's
Because
I
said
so.
It's
a

-Have
you
seen
it?
...but
the
kid
who
sits
HENRY:
JONESY:
You
don't
want
to
see
Don't
come.
Fuck

BOY:
Come
on.
Eat

Eat
it.
Hey,
you
guys!
Just
fucking
quit
it!
What
are
you
doing?
You're
trying
to
make
him
eat
that?
RICHIE:
Got
it.
I'll
make
him
eat
You
go
now.
Take
a
hike,
girls,
Piss
off.

-You
better
watch
it!
-I
know
who
you
are.
-You're
Rich
Grenadeau,
the

What
will
people
say
when
we
tell
them
You
won't
tell
anybody
anything
-Get
ready,
Pete.
Pete
can
fly.
When
you
come
for
us,
I
can't
catch
that
little
dick?
You
know
who
that
is?
That's
right,
fat-ass.
Pete
Moore.
He's
going
straight
to
his
house
She'll
call
the
cops
-You
know
him,
is
that
it?
Then
why
ask
for
trouble?
-He
likes
this
attention.
Come
on,
you
dickweeds!
-You
want
to
fight
us?
I'm
gone,
Henry.
-Why?
You'll
lose!
Why?
And
I'm
gonna
tell
the
world!
-You
want
us
to
leave,
is
that
it?
Let's
go.
Get
you
all
later.

HENRY:
Do
something.
Somebody!
If
I
do...
...and
you
tell
anybody,

HENRY:
-Beaver,
that's
beautiful.
Beaver!
You've

No.

Henry.
-Don't
mess
around.



JONES:
Easy.
You're
okay.
Thank
God.
Thank
God.
Gee,
thank
God!
I'm
lost.
I've
been
lost
Let's
get
you
inside.
-How
would
that
be?
Here,
let
me
get
that.
-Rick
McCarthy.
Our
damn
cell
phones
are
on
the
blink
...but
our
car
will
be
back
soon.
I
didn't
think
I'd
make
it.
You
saved
me,
that's
for
sure.
What's
that?
It's
a
dreamcatcher.
Indian
charm.
...keeps
them
away.
I've
had
enough
nightmares.

Been
doing
that
all
night.
I
ate
some
berries
in
the
dark.
I
think
they
must
have
upset
me.

Glad

What's
the
matter
with
you?
About
six
months
ago,
...I
did
something
terrible
with
a
patient.
Barry
Neiman.
Couple
days
ago,
I
saw
his
picture
Mind
if
I
don't
use
that
story
You
were

long
before
Thanks.
You're
a
real
comfort.
JONES:
Here
you
go,
Rick,
buddy.

CLARENDON:
Jesus
Christ
bananas!
-Thanks
a
lot,
Beav.
What
happened
to
you?
Hi.
Joe
Clarendon.
JONES:
Rick
here
had
a
bad
night
Welcome.
-Is
that
frostbite?
It's
allergy.
Grilled
cheese,
anyone?
MCCARTHY:
No,
the
soup's
fine
for
me.
My
mother
used
to
feed
me

Bitch
in
a
buzz
saw!
I've
heard
some
mighty
burps
I
am
so
embarrassed.
-Rick
ate
some
berries
in
the
woods.

Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God,
that's
awful!
I'm
so
sorry!
Rick,
buddy,
don't
worry
about
it.
What
have
you
been
eating,
JONES:
I
think
you
need
to
lie
down
You
know,
I
bet
you're
right.
I'm
just
tired,
that's
all.
-Come
on.
Beaver?
Come
on.
In
here.
Thank
you
for
taking
me
in.
-Shit,
anybody
would
have.
All
right,
this
is
in
case
...if
you
can't
get
to
the
bathroom,
If
you
go
in
the
first,
If
you
need
anything,
we're
outside.


Fuck
me,
give
me
some
air!
We
got
any
gas

handy?

-Wanna
hear
what'll
freak
you
out
more?
You
know
his
huge
stomach?
When
he
got
here,
his
stomach
was
I
wish
Henry
was
here.
He's
a
shrink,
not
an
internist.
He
went
to
med
school.
I
thought
about
it.
You
better
get
a
run
at
it.
DEVLIN:
Shit!
What
the
hell?
DEVLIN:
Pete,
are
you
okay?
-Okay.
Hang
on.
Hang
on
a
second.
-I'm
caught!
I
can't--
-God.
DEVLIN:
-Okay.
Here
comes
the
seat
belt.

I
got
you.
How's
your
leg?
Well,
it
ain't
broken.
You
don't
suppose
I
saw
that
once
in
a
movie.

CLARENDON:
DEVLIN:
MOORE:
I
ought
to
warn
you.
-I'd
guess
she's
already
dead.
She
almost
got
us
both
killed.
Hello!
Here
we
come,
ma'am.
Hello?
Forget
it,
H.
She's
gone.
Hello!

Ma'am,
can
you
hear
me?

I
wonder
if
maybe
that's
how
Listen,
Miss
Road
Kill,
Say
something.
I
have
to
find
Rick.
-Okay.
Yeah.
CLARENDON:
-What's
all
that
red
stuff
on
their
fur?
-I
never
saw
anything
like
this
before.
-Of
what?
Where
are
they
going?
...it's
what
are
they
running
away
from?

What
the
hell?
This
could
be
perfect.
Hey,
you
guys!
We
need
help!
Got
a
sick
guy
inside!
MAN:
-Stay
where
you
are.
-We
got
a

We
got

Glad
you're
okay.
This

MOORE:
I
gotta
ask
you,
old
buddy.
-Is
this
SSDD
or
not?
Different
shit
today,
Pete.
And
a
pretty
weird
day
so
far,
MOORE:

DEVLIN:

DEVLIN:
I'll
bring
the

back
Now,
Pete,
you
listen
to
me.
-Stay
with
her.
Keep
her
warm.
Henry!
If
we
die
before
you
get
back...
...promise
you'll
tell
everybody
-I
don't
like
this.
Not
at
all.
This
is
turning
into
a
double
fuckarow.
-Rick,
you
okay?
-I
just
need
to
make
a
little
room.
MCCARTHY:
Go
away!
MCCARTHY:
Can't
a
man
have
privacy?
MCCARTHY:
-Let's
do
it.
What
if
he's
dying?
Scooby-Dooby-Doo,
On
three.
Ready?
One....
Two....
Hold
it!
-No
bounce,
no
play.
One....
And
a
two....
Three!
Oh,
fuck!
Oh,
man!
I
don't
want
to
see
this!
-Shut
up
a
minute.
Mr.
McCarthy?
Rick?
I
don't
know.
Rick?

Oh,
man!
Jonesy,
if
he
can
still
do
that,
Can
you
hear
me?
Bullshit!
He
dropped
a
clinker!
-I
don't
think
that
was
a
clinker.
-Oh,
my
God!

-No!
No.
Good
move!
It's
trapped.

Okay.
CLARENDON:
-Listen,
we're
gonna
change
places.
-One
of
us
is
gonna
go
to
the
shed.
Shut
up
and
listen!
You
go
get
it,
come
back.
Then
we're
gonna
get
the
hell
-You
get
the
tape,
Jonesy.
You're
faster
than
me.
No,
if
it
does
get
out,
you
can't
fight
it.
Oh,
my
God!
-And
Beav?
Sit
tight,
buddy.

Okay.
Okay.


All
right.
Okay.

Shit!
Earth
to
Jonesy!

Jonesy.
Jonesy.
Okay.
Calm
down
now.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay,
here
it
is.
Okay.

Find
the
damn
tape!


Where
is
it?
Coming,
Beav!
Beaver!
Beav!
I
got
the--
What
the--?
Jonesy,
get
out
of
here!
Beaver.
-Get
out!
Shut
the
door!
Run,
Jonesy.


You
killed
him.
You
killed
Beaver.
You
killed
him,
you
fuck!
Ah!
What
do
you
want?


CURTIS:
They

the

-How
many

Yeah.
Not
nearly
enough
My
guess
is,
They've
never
picked

OWEN:
The
biggest
threat
Crash-landing
or
not...
...they'll
try
to
get
out

always
say
they
never

They're
up
to
their
old
tricks.
Using
a
standard

look...
...with
the
innocent
doggy
eyes
They
project
what
they
think
But
I've
had
a
look
at
the
real
thing.
You
-Difference
of
opinion
about
the
Ripley.
-Who
do
you
think?
-Three-star
General
Matheson.
-When
did
you
see
him?
What's
the
opinion
...who've
never
been
near
an
ET?
They
say
the
fungus
doesn't
take
hold
Really?
The
ones
blasting
out
Does
Matheson
think
Their
theory
is,
they
only
grow
in
a
small
Do
you
like
that
theory,
bucko?
I
think
it's
crap.
CURTIS:
So
if
you
thought
someone
-...and
you
had
them
in
your
grasp--
-...to
wander
as
they
wish.
Pissing
in
the
same
latrine.
If
the
Ripley
gets
out
of
this
Well,
it
just
can't
be
allowed
to
do
that.
I've
quarantined
the
entire
area.
-Nothing
leaves
alive.

Come!
Got
Maples
here,
boss.
-Corporal
Maples,
sir.
I
mean,
boss.
I
handpicked
every
man
in
Blue

MAPLES:
Yes,
sir.
I'm
sorry,
boss.
-Yes,
the

for
all
buckos.
-No,
boss.
Better.
Under
the
radar.

don't
salute,

What
rules
does
it
operate
by?
That's
right,
laddie.
When
a
soldier
disobeys
a
superior's
And
is
to
be
punished
immediately
That's
me.
Capisce?
Now
answer
me
one
question
But
you
have
to
answer
honestly.
You
were
on
containment
detail
at
0600
Did
you
allow
a
young
woman
...to
exit
the
zone
in
their
own
vehicle
Colonel
Curtis,
she
hadn't
been
She
made
a
wrong
turn.
You
know
this
for
a
fact?
-For
a
fact,
boss.
Can
you
raise
your
hand
and
tell
me
Then
do
it,
Maples.
Swear
on
it.
Scout's
honor.

Stop
your
blatting,
laddie-buck!
You
just
avoided
a
court-martial,
boy.
You
lie
to
me
again,
-Get
him
out
before
I
change
my
mind.
Sentry!
-Jesus,
Abe.
Could
have
gotten
off
-Instead
of
taking
his
whole
hand?
He
came
into
my
house,
told
me
lies.
-You
think
I'm
crazy,
Owen?
I
lost
my
temper
there.
But
that
The
pretty
mom
he
let
pass
She's
down
at
the
barn
right
now
Twenty-five
years,
Owen.
Twenty-five
years
I've
been
going
out
...show
them
they
picked
the
wrong
And
frankly,
laddie,
Luckily
for
me,
there's
one
bit
I
have
you.
To
lead
the
assault
today
-What
are
you
talking
about,
Abe?
From
now
on,
you
will
lead
the
band.
-You
know
where
I
got
that?
That's
right.
He
gave
it
to
me.
-Abe,
I
don't
know
how
to....
-Just
tell
me
how
we
do
it.
-How
do
we
come
out?
...and
smiling.
Ah.
MOORE:
That's
a
good
idea.
Save
your
energy

MOORE:
Well,
it's
very
nice
of
you
to
You're
one
of
those
rare
women
who
The
truck
that
handles
like
a
luxury
car.

But
seriously,
folks,
...just
in
case
I
should,
you
know,
...turn
into
a
goddamn
Petesicle.
I'm
sure
Henry
or
Jonesy
or
Beaver
They're
my
friends.
Now,
ma'am,
...so
please,
don't
get
freaked
out
...who
you
shouldn't
meet
Just
some
innocent
fried
clams
You
see,
the
four
of
us,
...we
all
have
this
other
friend
And
our
friend
Duddits,
well,
One
day,
a
long
time
ago,
It's
this....
How
shall
I
put
it?
This
ability.
...to
talk
to
each
other
without
talking
Do
you
see
what
I'm
getting
at?
I
knew
you
would.
Lately,
I've
been
having
this
dream...
...and
in
the
dream,
I
understand
how
I
think
maybe
our
friend
Duds
I
think
Duddits
is
from
somewhere
else...
...and
he
came
here
It's
crazy.
Talking
shit
about
He's
so
goddamned
good.
I
should
be
singing
his
praises,
I
gotta
pee.
That's
what
I
should
do.


Here's
to
you,
Duds.
The
highest
civilian
decoration.
Lord,
I
will
never
drink
again.




DEVLIN:
Yesterday
you
want
to
call
it
quits,
Today,
you're
begging,
praying.
Make
up
your
mind.

Jonesy!
Here
you
come
to
save
the
day!
What
the
hell?
Who's
Mr.
Gray?
What
are
you
trying
to
tell
me,
Jonesy?
You're
not
Jonesy.
IN
ENGLISH
ACCENT:
What
was
that,
JONES:
Are
you
speaking
to
me?
That's
what
your
friends
call
you,
-Why
are
you
letting
me
live?
-We're
going
to
take
a
little
journey.
He
had
nothing
in
his
head.
-Fuck
you!
I've
studied
the
foul
language
section
Rather
distasteful,
I
must
say.
How
about
this,
Mr.
Gray?
Why
did
you
call
me
Mr.
Gray?
Watch
out
for
Ister
Gay.
Someone
told
you
about
me.
If
you
want
to
know,
Surprisingly,
...I
don't
understand
it.

Oh,
Pete,
Jesus!
MOORE:
Motherfucker
tried
to
bite
I
always
thought
it
would
be
my
ex-wife
Let's
get
you
to
some
help.
Can
you
still
see
the
line,
buddy?
-I
don't
need
it
to
get
to
Gosselin's.
...if
we
didn't
want
to
go
to
Gosselin's,
95?
Who
gives
a
shit?
What's
wrong
with
you?
-Wait
a
minute,
you're
not--
You're
too
messed
up
Too
late
for
that.
Pete,
I
need
you
Who
the
fuck
are
you?
You
sound
This
has
to
do
with
the
fucking
eel,
Stop
it!
I'll
get
him
to
help.

Now,
Pete,
which
way
to
l-95?
My,
my.
That
is
a
gift.
Who
taught
you
that?
You're
gonna
be
a
big
help,
Pete.
Climb
aboard.


MR.
GRAY:
Show's
over.
Let
me
in.
What
have
you
got
Your
memories
are
out
here
I
want
to
know
who
warned
you
about
I'm
sure
the
answers
are
here.
-To
find
them.
-It's
the
polite
thing
to
do.

Beav!

What
is
this?
Oh,
Beav.
Shit!
Fuck
me,
Freddy.



Oh,
shit.
Asshole!


So
long,
Beav.
Love
you,
man.
PETE:
BEAVER:
HENRY:
Mine's
deformed.
-Eaver,
Henny,
Ownzy,
Eet!
I
Duddits.
-Yes.
I
Duddits.
ALL:
HENRY:
Duds
will
find
her.
JONESY:
He
can
do
anything.
-She
always
waves.
-Save
this
world?
-We'll
save
the
world
some
other
time.
-Yeah,
it's
a
mystery.
-Dreamcatcher.
Duds'll
read
our
minds.
HENRY:
Josie,
Josie,
Josie.
"Josie
Rinkenhauer."

-Josie?
JONESY:
This
is
completely
crazy.
-I
didn't
say
anything.
-You
said,
"This
is
completely
crazy."
I
thought
it.
Kiss
my
bender.
Duds
can
hear
HENRY:
Hey,
guys!
She's
down
here
for
sure!
Josie,
you
down
there?
Josie!
Josie!
Fuck
me,
Freddy,
she's
down
there.
I
know
it.
I
can
see
her
in
my
head.
-Yeah.
JOSIE:
-Help
me.
HENRY:

Don't
sing.
BEAVER:
Shut
up.
There's,
like,
rat
shit.
HENRY:
PETE:
Duds!
We
got
her!

CURTIS:
Blue
Boy
leader.
-Right
here,
boss.
Fast
and
hard.
Sir?
I
see
it.
FEMALE:
Don't
hurt
us.
MALE:
There
is
no
infection
here.
It's
not
the
radio.
FEMALE:
We
are
helpless.
MALE:
There's
no
infection
here.
This
gives
you
an
idea
If
anybody's
thinking,
...all
naked
and
unarmed
beside
...what
kind
of
a
dog,
...could
hear
that
heartbreak
-Well,
I'm
that
dog.
I'm
that
monster.
CURTIS:
These
mothers
are
as
harmless
And
I'm
here
to
kick
some
ass!
-Yes,
boss!
Right
on,
boss.
FEMALE:
I
have
a
visual.
Holy
shit!
Damn,
look
at
the
size
of
that.
Blue
Boy
group,
this
is
Blue
Boy
leader.
Gentlemen,
lock
and
load.
Hellfires
are
hot.
Sing
it
out,
Owen!
Blue
Boy
group,
this
is
Blue
Boy
leader.
MALE:
Don't
hurt
us.
MALE:
There
is
no
infection
here.
-Fire
at
will!


CURTIS:
It's
gonna
blow!
Blue
Boy
group,
withdraw
at
once.
-We
can
get
them!
-Blue
Boy
group,
get
out
of
there!
CURTIS:
OWEN:
Pull
out!
Get
out
of
there!
MOORE:
Jonesy,
I've
been
thinking
For
a
long
time
I
thought
he
was
sent
-I
could
never
figure
what
it
was.
MOORE:
Not
till
today.
-He
wanted
to
warn
us.
-Did
he
show
you
that
nifty
trick?
MR.
GRAY:
Come
on,
Pete.
Let's
talk.
All
right,
Pete,
I'll
bite.
No,
no!
You
bastard!
No!
Pete.
Don't
talk
to
him!
MR.
GRAY:

-What's
up?
I'm
broke
down
here
That's
a
good-looking
dog.
-Where
you
headed?
Any
chance
you're
going
near
there?
That's
where
I'm
going.
Well,
I
believe
your
tailgate
Let's
take
a
look.
I
see
you
have
some
cargo


MR.
GRAY:
All
you
can
eat.
Good
doggy.
Yes.
Have
your
fill.
Eat
all
you
want--

Jonesy.
Jonesy!

Oh,
God!



MAN:
Halt
or
we'll
fire!
-Halt!
CURTIS:
I'll
show
you
things


MAN
1:
How
long
we
gotta
be
here?
MAN
1:
I
demand
to
see
my
lawyer!
MAN
2:
MAN
1:
When
do
we
get
out?
-You
can't
do
this
to
people
in
America!
-My
wife--
...they
can
to
get
you
out
of
here.
We're
doing
everything
We'll
get
you
back
to
your
homes
MAN:
Can
I
help
you,
sir?
-Henry.
Dr.
Henry
Devlin.
We
need
doctors
in
there.
Come
on,
laddie,
I'll
buy
you
a
cup.
-You,
sir,
where
you
from?
Beantown?
Great
city.
Maybe
by
morning.
Hurry
up,
bucko.
You
see
that
crud
on
the
faces
...you
know
why
I
relish
a
turn
You
were
excellent
out
there,
O.
Abe?
Abe?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
I'm
fine.
I
don't
know
what
the
hell
It's
the
only
way,
Owen.
We've
got
to
cauterize
the
site.
They've
all
got
to
die.
It's
the
only
way.
OWEN:
Studies
point
to
the
strong
possibility
The
studies
show
squat,
If
Matheson
had
been
in
my
spot
...you'd
have
never
made
Those
gray
bastards
would
have
had
you
Some
get
better.
At
least
Which
ones,
Mother
Teresa?
Can
you
guarantee
they
won't
take
it
I'll
tell
you
what
you
should
be
worried
Not
these
few
unfortunates.
What
you
should
be
worried
-What?
Our
greatest
fear
is
that
a
grayboy
...with
somebody
and
would
carry
them
To
scatter
the
infection,
-Are
you
sure
there
isn't
such
a
person?
But
I
am
sure
that
if
there
is
one
Not
with
the
net
my
boys
And
if
we
do
a
thorough
job
If
we
don't
get
gooey
...when
our
job
is
taking
care
Capisce?
Owen,
if
you
think
this
is
easy
for
me,
Those
poor
schmucks.
They
drive
Chevrolets,
...never
miss
an
episode
of
Friends.
These
are
Americans.
The
idea
of
slaughtering
Americans...
...it
just
turns
my
stomach.
But
I'll
do
it.
So
if
we
start
at
2,
we
can
be
done
Except
for
the
dreams.
Yeah,
except
for
them.
What
are
you
gonna
tell
Rita
What
are
you
gonna
tell
Katrina
You
know
me,
don't
you?
...but
you
know
me.
We
don't
have
time
to
screw
around.
-One
you
know
about,
one
you
don't.
Your
mentor,
Colonel
Curtis,
he's
gone
Now
he
wants
you
to
help
him
-Who
are
you?
Talk
about
that
later,
-Hey.
You
won't
let
me
burn
on
this
fence...
...any
more
than
you'll
help
What
you're
thinking
now
is
whether
...in
your
duffle
bag
will
-Somebody
named
General
Matheson.
"Sometimes
we
have
to
kill,
Your
father
was
a
great
soldier.
Those
were
his
last
words.
You
carry
his
picture
with
you
always.
Tell
me
everything.
You'll
save
these
people.
When
we're
done
talking,
get
on
the
Cavalry
rides
in.
That
takes
care
of
problem
number
one.
You
think
the
infection's
been
contained,
You're
wrong.
He's
riding
with
A
guy
named
Gary
Jones.
You
and
I
don't
get
after
him
right
away,
...and
some
kind
of
shit

Our
nightmare
hitchhiker.
And
all
Dr.
Mystery
wants
is
a
free
pass
-Very
convenient.
Okay.
Where
is
he?
Had
him
taken
to
the
tractor
shed.
Okay.
I'll
check
him
out
Whatever
you
say,
boss.
Come
on,
come
on.
Time's
a-wasting.

All
right,
lad,
open
up.
CURTIS:
Are
you
in
here?
MAN:
Where
I've
been
put.
A
prisoner
on
my
own
damn
property.

MAN:
DEVLIN:
Get
in!
You
almost
ran
me
down.
Figured
you'd
read
my
mind
MAN:
Blue
Unit,
stand
down.
-Put
down
your
weapons
at
once.
Your
mission
is
rescinded.
This
is
no
longer
a
Blue
Unit
operation.
Put
down
your
arms.
General
Matheson
CURTIS:
Okay.
You
just
drove
over
the
Curtis
line.
-Where
we
going?
All
I
know
right
now.
...we'll
know
everything


That's
some
gun.
-Kind
of
flashy
for
a
guy
like
you.
I
know.
Where
are
you,
Jonesy?
Pick
up
the
phone.
Call
1-800-HENRY.

Hello?
Jonesy!
Jesus
Christ,
I
knew
it
was
you.
Massachusetts?
He
is?
Duddits?
Okay,
I
will.
Jonesy?
He
hung
up.
Give
me
back
my
gun.
-We
gotta
go
to
Derry.
No,
they're
going
towards
Jonesy
says
Mr.
Gray
Your
buddy,
he's
still
alive
Yeah,
he's
immune.
He
got
hit
by
a
car
I
don't
think
he
even
knows
it.
He
came
back
from
the
dead.
It's
almost
like
Duddits
saw
Jonesy
told
me
it
was
Duddits
If
we
catch
him,
You
know
we
have
to
do
it.
...assuming
we
can
catch
him.
OWEN:
When
was
the
last
time
Long
time
ago.
Years.
What
makes
you
so
sure
he
can
help?
Duddits
can
do
anything.
I
didn't
understand
that
then,
He's
the
one
who
made
us
like
this.
-Like
what?
He's
been
waiting
for
you.
DEVLIN:
DUDDITS:
Henny.
I
miss
you,
Henny.
I
miss
you.
Henny.
Long
time,
Henny.
Henny.
DEVLIN:
My
God,
Roberta,
what
is
it?
I'm
gonna
let
you
take
him,
Just
now,
when
he
was
getting
ready...
...Henry,
he
was
so
excited.
Like
he
hasn't
been
in
such
a
long
time.
I
think...
...that
if
he's
with
you,
...instead
of
in
this
awful
room.
Be
sure
the
parka
stays
on
tight.
The
medication
and
instructions
Bye,
Mom.

ROBERTA:
Now,
go
save
the
world.
All
right,
laddie.
They
haven't
got
enough
courage
What've
we
got?
They're
leaving
Derry,
Maine,
heading
CURTIS:

Stay
with
it,
bucko.
General
Matheson.
Come
in,
please.
This
is
very
nice,
Abe.
CURTIS:
Was
there
something
we
hadn't
covered?
I
don't
think
I
got
to
say
before
how
It
was
with
sincere
regret--
Herman--
May
I
call
you
Herman?
We
may
not
agree
on
all
the
strategic
I'm
past
it.
Burned
out.
Should
have
quit

Even
I
don't
trust
my
judgment
anymore.
Oh,
yeah....
My
techies
tell
me
we're
getting
some
Yes,
I've
been
talking
I
don't
know
if
you've
ever
met
Barbara.
She's
very
happy,
I
can
tell
you
that.
I'll
If
that's
soon
enough.
That
will
be
fine.



How
do
you
turn
off
the
goddamn
lights?
JONES:
Maybe
you
shouldn't
have
been
You're
making
yourself
at
home.
You
have
no
idea,
Jonesy.
"Maybe
you
shouldn't
have
been
Oh,
don't
like
that,
Gary,
do
you?
CAVELL:
He's
in
a
police
car
now.
Can
you
see
where
they
are,
Duds?
Ownzy.
He's
in
Ister
Gay.
Mr.
Gray.
That's
right,
Duds,
he
is
in
Mr.
Gray.
"Ister
Gay"
is
Mr.
Gray.
We
gotta
save
this
girl.
Save
the
world?
Not
the
world,
Duds,
a
girl.
Ister
Gay?
You
already
knew.
Where's
he
going,
Duds?
Where
is
Mr.
Gray
taking
Jonesy?
Ister
Gay,
he
want
war.
-War?
Mr.
Gray
wants
water.
I
know
where
he's
going.
-He's
going
to
the
Quabbin
Reservoir.
It
supplies
drinking
water
-Hmm.
One
worm
kills
the
world.
One
worm
kills
the
world?
Oh,
my
God.
One
worm.
Back
at
our
cabin,
I
saw
the
worms
Mr.
Gray
must
want
to
get
one
Just
one
worm
infects
the
whole
world?
-Are
we
going
right?
Take
the
495
to
the
Mass
Pike.
Are
you
ready
to
try
something
hard?
Yes,
Henny.
Good.
Can
you
talk
to
Jonesy?
Can
you
make
him
hear
you?
Ownzy...
...and
Ister
Gay.
Duddits.
I
knew
it.
I
knew
it.
Waiting.
Jonesy?
It
appears
We
owe
it
to
our
friend,
Duddits.
JONES:
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
Maybe
your
clever
friend
didn't
want
That's
why
you
had
nothing
Duddits
didn't
bother
to
tell
you
It
doesn't
matter.

His
little
scheme
didn't
work.
We're
almost
there.
What
was
it
your
poetry
file
had
to
say?
I
have
promises
to
keep
And
miles
to
go
before
I
sleep

MAN:

JONES:
Thank
you,
Gary
Jones.

Go
up
around
the
reservoir.
Aqueduct
to
Boston
starts
in
Shaft
12.


MR.
GRAY:
Just
up
ahead.



MR.
GRAY:




Stay
here
and
take
care
of
your
friend.
No
matter
what
you
hear.
So
long,
doctor.

MR.
GRAY:
Good
girl.

Shit!
You
son
of
a
bitch!
Wait.
Wait.
Go
back
to
car,
Duddie.
You'll
be
safer
there.

Look
out,
Jonesy.
I
knew
you'd
come,
Henry.
I
knew
you
wouldn't
let
me
die.
Who
the
fuck
are
you?
-Don't
you
know
me,
H?
I
think
I'm
gonna
have
to
shoot
you.
Just
to
be
sure.
Well,
maybe
you're
right,
my
friend.
I
don't
know
myself
if
Mr.
Gray
is
gone.
He
could
be
hiding
in
here
somewhere...
...waiting
for
his
chance.
Tell
me
something
Mr.
Gray
Tell
me
something
only
we
would
know.
SSDD.
Not
good
enough.
Well,
you
decide.
Ask
me
anything.

At
Tracker
Brothers,
...what
was
painted
No...
...bounce....
No
play.
Hello...
...Ister
Gay.
MR.
GRAY:
Ooby-Ooby-Doo...
...we
got
some
work
to
do
now.

Ister
Gay...
...go
away.
No!
I
Duddits.
H?
Jonesy.
Jonesy,
if
that
really
is
your
name....
-That'll
be
50
small.
DUDDITS:
I
Duddits.
MOORE:
They're
my
friends.
