Clitoris

magnificent.
-Who

hell
are
these
girls?
This
is
where
the
best
girls
are.
The
best.
How
far
east?
You
can
go
as
far
as
Ukraine,
These
girls
I
met
...just
outside
Bratislava.
The
girls
there
are
so
hot
And
they
love
anyone
foreign,
They
hear
your
accent,
So
wait,
this
place
Josh.
You
won't
find
this
hostel
Barcelona,
so
many
Americans.
But
Slovakia?
No
one
there.
There
is
so
much
pussy,
and
because
You
go
to
this
hostel,
They
go
crazy
for
any
foreigner.
You
just...
...take
them.
Fuck,
man.
Can't
you
keep
your
Viking
ass
Hey,
man,
I
shaved
my
ass

all
right.
Okay,
stop.
I'm
sorry.
My
daughter.
She
miss
her
daddy,
Yeah,
no
problem,
dude,
it's
cool.
-Saskia.
-She's
adorable.
This
is
Svanhildur,
my
daughter.
-Very
pretty.
She's
starting
school
this
year.
Wait,
you
have
a
daughter?
Yeah,
of
course,
my
horse.
Okay.
All
right.
-You
are
on
vacation?
Our
next
stop
is
Bratislava.
-What?
You
will
like
it.
Casino,
girls.
You
can
pay
to
do
anything.
Anything.
-How
are
the
girls?
They
will
love
you.
Handsome
devil.
He
is
handsome.
That's...
That's
awkward.
That's
awkward
too.
-You
need
a
fork
there,
chief?
I
prefer
to
use
my
hands.
I
believe...
...people
have
They
do
not
think:
"This
is
something
who
gave
its
life
I
like
to
have
a
connection
I
appreciate
it
more.
Well,
I'm
vegetarian.
And
I
am
a
meat-eater.
It's
human
nature.
Well,
I'm
human,
Tell
me,
what
is
your
nature?
Don't
touch!
I'm
sorry.
Excuse
me.
Fucking
freak.
Jesus.
Edward
Saladhands
Dude,
you
finally
hooked
up.
Yeah,
that's
fucking
hilarious.
Or
we
could
visit
some
factories.
Should
be
cool.
In
this
area...
...we
make
plastic
for
Slovakia.
Is
that
so?
Look
at
this.
-Nice,
eh?
Holy
shit.
You
can
have
that,
man.
Hey,

The
party

are
saved
from
boredom.
You

a
reservation
under
-Yeah,
of
course,
my
horse.
-He
doesn't
get
out
of
his
cage
much.
Here
are
your
keys.
You
leave
your
passports
That
was
taken
when
I
was
like
1
3.
Not
anymore,
though,
you
know?
Do
you
have
any
private
rooms?
The
rooms
are
semiprivate,
Roommates,

That's
gay.
Sorry.
-Oh,
my
God.
The

is
yours.
You

Spa.
Jugs.

I

the
smoothest
balls

Hello.
Face

the
ass.
Never
gets
old.
Jesus.
So
where
are
you
girls
from?
I'm
from
Italy,
Prague.
Prague's
cool.
Kafka.
So,
Natalya....
-Yeah?
Oh,
my
God.
-This
is
awesome.
I
mean,
I
was
a
senior,
...and
then
I
graduated,
I
mean,
I'm
totally
over
it.
It's
okay.
Look,
Vala
is
here.
-Who?
-All
right,
Oli.
I'm
the
King
of
the
Swing.
Come,
let's
dance.
-Does
the
cigarette
bother
you?
I
put
away.
It's
fine,
I....
I'm
gonna
go
get
some
fresh
air.
But
I'll
be
back,
okay?
Cigarette.
Cigarette.
Aren't
you
a
little
young?
-Dollar.
Dollar.
-Dollar.
Here,
children
commit
They
don't
care.
-You're
okay?
Hey,
let
me
buy
you
a
drink.
-Yeah?
Hey,
Josh.
Faggot.
Go
with
your
friends.
It's
okay.
I
wanted
to
say
sorry
about
earlier.
About
the
way
I
reacted.
We
cool?
I
would
have
done
It's
not
easy...
...but
from
my
experience...
...choosing
to
have
a
family
Now
I
have
my
little
girl...
...who
means
more
to
me
But
you
should
do...
...whatever's
right
for
you.
Excuse
me,
it's
my
turn
now.
Should
we
be
doing
this
Yeah,
it's
okay.
-Yeah,
baby.
Josh,
give
it
to
me,
baby.
-All
right.
-We
go
to
spa.
Spa,
spa,
spa.
Bye.
Mission
accomplished.
You
know
that
Amsterdam
kid
I'm
gonna
send
him
Be
quiet.
They're
showering
together.
Shit,
man.
We're
never
leaving
here.
I
guess
Oli's
not
back
yet.
No,
dude,
he
probably
We'll
see
him
at
breakfast.
-What's
the
name?
How
are
we
supposed
to
Fucking
gay.
Yeah,
he
checked
out
this
morning.
You
mean
he
took
his
No,
it
say
he
checked
out
-When
this
morning?
I
could
find
out
tomorrow.
Hey,
Oli,
it's
Pax.
Can
I
leave
a
note
Okay,
cool.
Yeah.
All
right.
He's
probably
still
with
Vala.
Okay.
-We
see
you
later,
right?
Okay.
-Bye-bye.
Oli,
hey,
it's
me
again.
You're
gay.
-Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Your
friend.
-What
the
hell?
What
does
that
say?
Sayonara.
Your
friend.
What,
they
left?
Like,
together?
That
doesn't
make
any
sense.
I
mean,
no
offense,
but...
When
did
she
send
this
to
you?
This
picture.
Today?
Could
you
do
me
a
favor
This
picture.
That
water
looks
fucking
cold.
You
know,
if
you
fell
in,
Dude,
did
I
tell
you
I
saw
-Where?
It
was
fucked
up,
man.
We
made
eye
contact,
...and
she
was
yelling
for
me
Yeah?
What
did
you
do?
I
ran
to
the
lifeguard,
who
was
busy
...and
I
yelled,
you
know,
And
she
couldn't
see
her.
And
then
a
second
later
all
you
could
It
was
that
little
girl's
mother,
dude.
Her
kid
was
dead.
-Jesus.
I
mean,
I'd
wake
up
every
fucking
I
just....
I
just
felt
like
I
could
have
You
did
the
right
thing.
Yeah,
well,
I
didn't
see
it
All
I
knew
was
this
little
girl
was
dead
What
makes
you
think
of
this
now?
Bubble
gum.
-Sorry,
kid.
What
are
you
doing?
These
fucking
kids
are
dangerous.
Hey,
Oli.
-Hey,
Oli.
-Hey.
-Hey,
Oli.
Hey!
It's
your
lucky
day,
Josh.
A
museum.
How's
it
hanging?
-What
the
fuck?
-He
got
you.
Okay.
Hey,
Oli.
Hey,
Oli.
Hey,
hey.
Excuse
me?
I'm
sorry,
I
thought
you
Well,
I'm
not.
Where
did
you
get
that
jacket?
-Hey,
I'm
talking
to
you,
man.
This
is
my
jacket.
It's
from
Oli.
"I
go
home"?
I
don't
know,
Hey,
Kana,
when
are
you
leaving?
I'm
sorry.
When
are
you
going
away?
Tomorrow,
I
go.
Okay,
because
we
may
go
too.
Do
you
wanna
go
to
the
train
with
us?
Tomorrow,
train?
Yeah,
yeah.
-Hello,
Josh.
-Hey.
Actually,
I
just
wanna
find
my
friend
Okay,
we'll
see
you.
Hey,
guys,
hold
up
a
sec.
Okay.
-Josh,
come
here,
dude.
It's
not
their
fault
Oli
disappeared,
-I'm
annoyed
he'd
ditch
us.
But
we're
not
in
America.
I
mean,
people
meet
each
other
It's
just
how
they
do
it
over
here.
As
well
as
we
may
think
we
know
Oli,
He
could've
gone
Fuck,
maybe
he's
in
Iceland.
So
let's
look
at
our
options.
We
can
A,
fuck
these
girls
one
more
...or
B,
not
fuck
them,
Think
about
it.
When
I'm
studying
for
...this
is
the
shit
Okay.
All
right,
he
doesn't
show
up,
-It's
his
problem.
All
right.
Hey,
Kana,
you
wanna
go
You
know,
disco?
No?
Josh?
-I'm
gonna
go
back.
I'm,
like...
I'm
tired.
Actually,
I
have,
like,
a
headache.
If
you
want,
I
will
go
with
you.
No,
no,
no,
I'll
just
see
you
Goodbye.
Fucking
pussy.
-Josh.
You
don't
look
well.
-No,
I...
I
feel
sick.
Where
is...?
You
need
rest.
Where's
the
restroom?
Past
the
bar,
in
the
back.
You
guys
cool?
-Vodka
Red
Bull.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Open
the
door.
Oh,
fuck.
What
the
f...?
Oh,
fuck.
What...?
Who
are
you?
What
the
f...?
Where
the
fuck
am
I?
What
the
fuck
is
this
shit?
Please,
please...
I
didn't
fucking
do
shit
to
you,
Please,
please,
what
the...?
Please,
no,
sir.
What
the
fuck?
Please,
I
didn't
fucking
do
anything.
What
the
fuck?
What
the
fuck?
What
the
fuck
is
this?
What?
No!
No,
please
don't...!
What
the...?
Oh,
my
God,
no,
no!
Oh,
my
God!
No,
no,
no,
no!
Oh,
please.
What
the
fuck?
No,
no,
no,
no,
fuck!
No!
Fuck!
Oh,
fuck!
You.
Why?
I
always
wanted
to
be
a
surgeon...
...but
the
boards
wouldn't
pass
me.
Can
you
guess
why?
You
see?
So
I
went
into
business...
...but
business
is
so
boring.
You
buy
things,
you
sell
them.
What
kind
of
life
is
that?
A
surgeon...
...he
holds
the
very
essence
Your
life.
He
touches
it.
He
has
a
relationship
with
it.
He's
part
of
it.
Please,
please.
You
want
to
go?
Is
that
what
you
want?
Oh,
my
God!
Fuck!
Oh,
fuck!
You
are
free
to
go.
Oh,
fuck.
No!
No.
No,
fuck.
No,
fuck...
Please,
I
have
money.
Ten
times,
two
times,
-Pay
me?
No
one
is
paying
me.
In
fact,
I
am
the
one
paying
them.
Relax.
Relax,
bro.
Oh,
shit.
-Two
thirty-seven,
please.
Didn't
you
check
out?
No,
not
yet.
Not
yet.
-This
your
bag?
The
maid
brought
it
here.
-I
didn't
check
out.
It
happened
this
morning.
This
is
bullshit.
Because
I
didn't
No,
man,
just
this
bag.
Yeah,
it's
definitely
a
mistake.
Chill
out,
man.
You're
on
vacation.
Two
three
seven.
Hey,
was
there
a
Japanese
girl
No,
think
they
left
this
morning.
Yeah.
I'm
sorry,
dude.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Excuse
me.
It's
okay.
We
are
going
to
the
spa.
You
will
join
us?
You
should
come.
Hey,
Josh,
call
me
I
got
locked
in
that
club.
I'm
at
the
hostel.
Svetlana!
Svetlana!
Hey!
You
little
fucker.
Jesus.
Wait
at
hostel
for
your
friends.
They
will
look
for
you
there
Yeah,
I
know.
But,
see,
my
friend
He
just
wouldn't
check
out
without
He's
the
responsible
one.
Yeah,
but
maybe
he
worried
...so
he
take
them
when
he
go
out.
Someone
misplace
if
he
leaves
note.
It
is
not
uncommon.
Yeah,
well,
is
there
There's
nothing
right
now.
We
have
his
picture...
...if
we
see
him,
or
he
is
picked
up,
...we
contact
you
at
hostel,
yeah?
Okay.
Where
are
you
from?
California.
You
are
so
far
from
home.
Paxton.
Come,
have
a
drink.
Hello,
Mr.
American.
-Did
you
get
my
messages?
There
are
so
many.
I
call
you
back,
but
child
answer.
Yeah,
I
know.
Have
you
seen
Josh?
In
English,
please.
He
is
with
your
friend...
...the
King
of
the
Swing.
-He's
with
Oli.
Did
you
not
listen
to
my
messages?
I
don't
know,
-What?
Where
are
my
friends?
The
art
show.
-You
mean
like
a
museum?
Not
museum.
-Exhibit.
No,
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Why?
What
is
wrong?
Well,
they
didn't
leave
a
note.
They
tell
us
to
tell
you.
Yeah,
but
