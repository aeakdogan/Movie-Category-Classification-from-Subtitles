Set

You

But
they
soon
realized...
He's
coming
after
us.
...
they
just
fucked
with
the
wrong
Mexican.

Uhh!
Suspense.
Aaaah!
Emotion.
Please,

Yeah,

I

Now

I

Abby.
Please.
Hey.
Hey!

Aah!
Aaaaah!


Pick

Where's
the
shit?
The
shit's
right
there.
The
deal
is
still
good.
No,
it's
not.
You
held
out
on
me.
Now
I
want
all
of
it.

Uhh!


Looks
like
I
got
you
You
certainly
have.
MULDOON:
So...
I
will
ask
you
one
more
time.
Where's...
the...
shit?
Everywhere.

Oh,
balls.

Get
that
thing
away
from
my
pumps!
It's
just
overheating.
I
need
to
get
to
town.
It's
just
a
stripped
radiator
cap.
Water
leaks
when
it
heats
up.
No
pressure.
You
okay?
I'm
just
cherry.
Go
on
and
have
a
seat
anywhere.
Here,
take
this
with
you.
That's
your
good

Ain't
nothing
good
about
it.
I

Saving

you?
Now,
how
did
you
know
that?

Now,
that's
a
rump
roast.
Mmm.
I
couldn't
get
off
work
this
week.
But
you
only
have
to
stay
till
10:00.

A
friend
of
mine
will
be
here
TONY:
I'm
going
to
eat
your
brains
What
did
I
tell
you?
-
Didn't
I
tell
you
that?
There's
a
packed
suitcase
Give
it
to
Tony
to
take
with
him
I
will
leave
him
watching
TV.
But
you
need
to
be
here
Thank
you.
Hey,
what
happened
to
your
tooth?
Fell
out.
Wow.
Think
you
can
say
a
prayer
No
dead
bodies
for
Da-da
tonight.
No
dead
bodies
for
Da-da
tonight.
Amen.
Who
was
that
you
were
talking
to?
Babysitter.
She's
on
her
way.

You
believe
her?
Me,
neither.
-
Hey.
-
How's
it
going,
J.
T.
?
-
Still
open,
I
see.

Free
of
charge.
Tonight...
is
a
special
night.
What's
so
special
about
tonight?
Been
open
25
years.
You
are
the
second

Who's
the
first?
Right
there.
Must
be
passing
through.
Seems
only
strangers
eat
here.
I
still
eat
here,
J.
T.
Oh,
yeah,
you
sure
do.
By
the
way,
don't
choke
Hello,
Palomita.
I
don't
go
by
that
name
anymore.
So,
uh...
you
ever
become
that--
Never
did.
I
thought
for
sure
you
would.
Talked
about
it
enough.
That's
the
problem
with
goals--
they
become
the
thing
you
talk
about
That's
my
jacket.
I
looked
for
it
for
two
weeks.
Yeah?
How
long
did
you
Yeah,
well,
the
jacket
belonged
to
me.
So,
um...
what
are
you
doing
now?
I'm
going
to
be
a
stand-up
comedian.
Really?
You
are
not
funny.
That's
what
I
have
been
trying
but
they
all
say
I'm
hysterical.
But
you
are
not.
There's
a
difference
and
being
dick.
Yeah,
well...
it
was
really
good
seeing
you
again.
Oh.
Um...
what
name
do
you
go
by
now...
in
case
I
want
to
catch
Cherry.
Cherry
Darling.
Sounds
like
a
stripper.
No,
it
sounds
like
a
go-go
dancer.
There's
a
difference.
Right.
Well...
you
will
always
be
Palomita
to
me.
I
need
a
ride.

What
do
you
say,
El
Wray?
I
will
give
you
a
ride.
Good-bye,
Bill.
-
Don't
you
mean
"see
you
later"?
Hey.
What's
up,
Doc?
The
little

looking
Looks
like
she
could
suck
I'm
kidding.
Heh.

Take
a
look
at
that
shit.
Well,
uh...
I
got
bit.
Bit?
Bit
by
what?
Well,
if
I
told
you,
I
need
some
Bactine
or
something?
Whew.
Can't
you
just...
sew
it
up?
Well,
normally
I
would.
I
would
even
be
doing
something
The
only
problem
is
DR
FELIX:
When
this
was
still
a
military
hospital,
this
one
guy
came
back
Whew!
Chronic
herpetic
lesions.
When
he
urinated,
it
came
out
kind
of
like
a
fountain.
Oh,
Jesus.
Well,
how
would
you
treat
it?
Fuck
that.
I
was
never
in
Iraq.
Good
for
you.
The
shit
they
spread
I
swear
to
God.
a
friend
of
mine
brought
back

They
were
Mustard

Actually,
I
still
have
those
in
my
fridge.
Bot
fly,
do
you
think?
DR
FELIX:
That
looks
like
gout.
He's
running
a
temperature
of
105.
-
Is
that
bad?
Bad
will
be
108.
You
could
have
a
seizure,
And--and
probably
die.
Say
"ahh.
"
-
Ahh.
Oh,
nice.
Black
abscessed
tongue.
All
abscesses


What
are
you
doing?
Shut
up,
Joe.
Baby...
get
the
needles.
Be
right
there.
BILL:

Asshole.
It's
spreading.
Holy
shit.
-
When
did
you
say
you
got
this
bite?
We
gotta
lose
the
arm,
Joe.
Lose
the
arm?
It's
spreading
all
the
way
Now,
if
we
don't
sever
that
arm
now,
and
we
can't
very
well
Well,
shouldn't
I
get
a
second
opinion?
Hi,
Joe.
I'm
going
to
give
you

you
won't
feel
anything
These...

My
yellow
friend...

is
just
to
take
the
sting
off.
My

you
will
barely
feel.
That
means
my
yellow
friend
See
how
fast
my
friends
work?
[distorted
voice)
[whispers)

They
all
react
differently.

Now
what?
RADIO

in
loving
memory
It's
not
the

Damn
it.



All

What,
like
an
armadillo?
Deer.
You
get
a
lot
of
them
around
here.
You
know,
I
read
a
statistic
that
said...
that
the
eating
of
venison
has
risen
60%
of
that's
from
road
kill.
People
eat
road
kill?
If
you
are
driving
out
here
and
a
deer
darts
out
if
you
blink
or
brake
or
swerve--
shit,
you
will
just
kill
yourself.
So,
what
do
you
do?
Just
pick
them
off...
just
like
this.
Send
it
flying
away
from
you.
Unacceptable.
Oh,
fuck!
CHERRY:
Aah!
Aah!
Cherry?
I
thought
you
said

you
saw
a
deer,
It
wasn't

Well,

You
know
you

your

that's
now
missing?
And
here
you
are
saying
that
someone
up
and
snatched
it?
And
that
you
shot
at
them
with
a
gun
that
you
never
should
have
had

Heh

Aah!
And
after

Why

Ah-ah!
Uhh!
Ahh!

This
is
fucking
ridiculous.

The
sheriff

Get

God
damn
it,
wait
for
me.
My
leg's
stuck
in
the
door!
-
It's
just
wood.
Will
you
just
leave
it
alone?
Why
is
this
happening
to
me?
I
don't
know.
Just--
stay
strong.
"Stay"?
Yeah,
baby.
Stay.
Okay,
my
name
is
Electra.
Fucking
listen.
My
name
is
Electra.

It's
furry.

No.
He's

furry
one.
She

I

by
El.
Does

You

fuck

Oye.
chica.
-
You
said
10:00!
We
can't
be
watching
your
kid
Your
friend
never
showed
up,
That's
right.
Then
start
doing
it.
Oh!
Uhh!
Tony!
We
are
leaving!
Wait,
my
tarantula.
Bring
it.
Let's
go.
And
my
turtle.
And
my
scorpion.
We
are
not
all
octopuses.
"Octopi."
Ohh...
come
on,
let's
go.
Tony,
what
did
I
tell
you?
You
can't
bring
them
all.
It's
okay.
They
can
live
What
about
my
pocket
bike?
It's
in
the
trunk.
Aah!
Where
do
you
think
you
are
going,

We
are
gonna
fucking
kill
you!


Are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
this?

SHERIFF
HAGUE:
Everybody
grab
a
badge
and
a
gun.
You
are
all
deputies
Except
for
you,
Wray.
Yo.
What
do
we
got?
Some
thing's
wrong
up
there.
J.T.
always
comes
out
and
greets.
Let's
go.
Try
not
to
shoot
yourselves.
Don't
shoot
each
other.
But
especially...
don't
shoot
me.

J.T.?
Go
on!
Get
off
him,
Rusty!

God
damn,
J.T.
Yah!

-

Barbecue?
Asshole.
Damn
good
sausage
link,
J.T.
Best

Texas.
Must
have
passed
out
Nice
shooting.
Everybody
gather
up
supplies.
We
head
out
in
20!



I
want
you
to
open
that
for
Mommy.
Now,
take
the
gun.
Careful.
And
if
anyone
comes
to
the
door
I
want
you
to
shoot
them,
okay?
I'm
not
kidding,
Tony.
You
shoot
them...
just
like
your
video
games.
You
shoot
them
in
the
head.
What
if
it's
Dad?
Especially
if
it's
your
dad.

And
be
careful
You
will
blow
your
own
face
off.
I
will
be
right
back.
I
love
you.



Tony!
Aah!
Hello,
baby.

Ohh!

Stay
away!
Look
what
you
did
to
our
son!
Stay
away!
God
damn
it,
I
told
you
Daddy!

Get
your
sorry
ass
in
here!
Aah!
If
it's
escape
vehicles
you
want,
Right
this
way.
Watch
that
meat.
Meet
my
wife.

Jesse
James
Custom
Dominator.
I
made
Jesse
a
plate
of
barbecue
he
made
this
baby
for
me
Got
anything
that
could
Where's
the
top?
This
baby's
chopped
permanent.
Ain't
got
no
roll
bar,
chicken
wire,
-
No
protection.
Nitrous-injected,
Who
are
you?
I
mean,
really.
Wray's
Wreckage.
That's
what
it
says
on
your
truck.
Are
you
a
wrecker,
Wray?
I'm
nobody.
It's
the
easiest
thing
to
remember.
So
remember
it.
J.T:
Just
stack
them
Hey,
you
want
some
barbecue?
Heh
heh
heh.
Best
in
Texas.
Aw,
no,
thanks.
What's
the
matter,
Oh,
I
eat
meat.
I
also
eat
lots
of
shit.
You
see
this?
What's
that?
Shit-eating
grin.

You
ought
to
be
a
comedian.
What
do
you
think
of
the
leg?
Oh,
that's
funny.
How's
your
stump?
They
knocked
it
out
something
fierce.
Still
can't
feel
a
thing.
This
must
be
the
real
Bone
Shack.

Old
J.
T.
knows
how
to
live.
Like
fuck
he
does.
I
like
how
you
say
"fuck".
Good.
Fuck
you.
Fuck
me?
Oh,
so,
now
you
are
the
comedian.
Go
ahead,
drop
your
pants.
That
will
be
good
for
a
laugh.
I
highly
doubt
that.
That's
my
jacket.
Yes,
I
know.
I
looked
for
it
for
two
weeks.
Look,
you
were
being
I
was
walking
out
on
you.
I
was
cold.
So,
if
you
are
gonna
go
on
one
of
your
about
a
fucking
jacket,
'cause
I
would
rather
fucking
freeze
Did
you
find
what
was
in
the
pocket?
Fuck
no.
Look
for
it.
No,
the
other
one.
I
was
gonna
give
it
to
you,
You
took
the
jacket.

Read
it.
"Two
against
the
world.
"
Remember
that?
I
never
forgot
it.
Then
why
would
you
leave?
Because
you
didn't
believe
in
us,
or
in
me.





I
figured
one
of
them
new
deputies
but
not
you,
Tolo!
Sorry.
I'm
sorry.
-
Dumb-ass.
-
McGraw's
here.
-
And
a
whole
bunch
of
others.
Come
on!
Over
here.
Move
your
ass!
Come
on!



What
did
I
tell
you,
Tony?
Don't
point
the
gun
at
yourself.
Didn't
I
tell
you
that?
Thank
you
for
telling
me
about...
you
know.
Don't
mention
it.
That's
an
order.
If
I
had
known
that
you
were...
El
Wray...
I
wouldn't
have
given
you
I
didn't
mean
to
be
a
prick
about
it.
Need-to-know
basis,
that
kind
of
shit.
Take
this.
Do
what
you
do
best.
No,
you
are
not!
Don't
give
him
the
gun.
Not--
Give
him
the
gun,
Tolo.

Give
him
the
gun.
Give
him
all
the
guns.

Holy
shit.
That
boy's
got
the
devil
in
him.
We
gotta
fight
them
off.
Get
to
our
vehicles.
Everyone
behind
me!



Outside
now!

God
damn
you!

Everybody
back
inside!
You,
Skip.
Front
and
center.
You
go
out
front,
We
will
need
it
to
transport
You
fucking
crazy?
-
I
will
cover
you.
I
never
miss.
Come
on,
Skip.
It's
go-go.
Not
cry-cry.
Cherry!

Oh,
dear.

-


Aah!
J.
T.
!
You
take
whoever
you
can
fit
Everyone
else
on
board!
Skip,
grab
the
twins!
You
take
the
chopper.
I
need
someone
else
I
will
do
it.
You
are
bleeding
like
a
stuck
pig.
Your
vision's
blurred
Anything
else?
Don't
wreck
it.
Somebody
grab
the
slaw!
You
can't
have
no
barbecue
-
Give
me
a
gun.
Fucking
cool!
All
right,
y'all,
head
out.
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
Bye,
Daddy.
Do
you
remember
how
to
ride
a
bike?
Useless
talent
number
32.

Good.
Anyone
else
have
a
car?
Now,
you
are
sure
you
are
okay
Hell
yeah.
Dakota...
Thanks.
Your
engine
is
shot
But
I
have
got
his
pocket
bike
Is
it
fast?
Zero
to
fifty
in
four
seconds.
You
ride
with
her.
I'm
Cherry.
You
sure
are.
Move
out!
Damn
shame.

[shrieks)

-

-

God
damn
it!
Aah!


Sheriff!
How
much
ammo
we
got?
Not
enough.

Don't
shoot!
MULDOON:
All
survivors
gotta
come
with
us.
Especially
you...
El
Wray.
I
don't
go
by
that
name
anymore.


It's
okay.
It's
okay.
We
are
here
in
quarantine

Where
is
here?
CHERRY:
The
old
army
base.
El
Wray?
That
you?
He's
with
them.
I'm
a
scientist...
and
a
businessman.
Which
is
why
he's
gonna
tell
us
They
are
stealing
biochemical
weapons.
DC-2?
Also
known
as
"Project
Terror.
"
Designed
to
take
out
an
entire
populace
You
were
supplying
it
to
them.
-
That's
why
they
shut
you
out.
It's
under
our
feet.
Ten
stories
down.
The
only
treatment
It
delays
the
negative
effects.
They
need
it...
like
a
drug.
Correct.
But
we
found
that
are
not
affected
by
the
gas
itself,
and
within
this
small
percentage
What
do
you
want
to
do?
Mexico.
Put
our
backs
against
the
ocean
and
defend
ourselves
from
there.
No.
We
have
to
get
back
to
my
lab.
This
infection
will
spread
to
every
man,
woman
and
child,
unless
I
finish
my
antidote.
You
have
an
antidote?

You!
You!
Come
with
us.
Move
it!
Move
it,
Peggy!
Uhh!

I'm
sorry?
Ava
Gardner.
Yeah,
I
guess.
I
was
just
thinking
that
you,
uh...
kind
of
look
like
Ava
Gardner

You
got
something
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
You
got
nothing
to
say,
huh?
'Cause
I
could
have
swore
you
just
You
want
to
say
"fuck
you"
to
me?
Not
at
this
moment.
You
know
what
this
is?
A
gun.
It's
simplicity
itself.
You
see,
you
point
it
and
you
pull
the
little
trigger
here...
and
a
little
bullet
comes
out
of
here.
And
the
little
bullet
And
you
know
what?
You
don't
look
like

Don't
taunt
me,
tramp.
I
am
not
one
to
be
taunted.
You
got
it?
Let
me
here
you
say,
"l
got
it.
"
I
got
it.
You
damn
well
better.

Tool.

J.T.:

I
figured
it
out.
Salt.
Got
it
all
figured
out.
It's
salt.
Blood
is
salty.
That's
all
my
sauce
needed,
It
just
needed
a
little
thickening
agent.
What
are
you
doing,
J.
T.
?
That's
all
I
gotta
do,
It
would
just
do
the
same
goddamn
thing
I
tell
you
what,
brother,
Don't
do
nothing
stupid,
J.
T.
It's
already
got
my
sweat,
it's
got
my
tears.
-
Drop
the
gun!

-
Do
it
now!
Don't
shoot!
J.T.,
you
all
right?

Uhh!
Hey,
you
all
right,
bro?
J.T.:
God
damn
it,
Not
at
all.
Wait
here.
Oh...
I
sure
will.

Goddamn
sauce.
NARRATOR:
"Women
in
Cages".
See
them
in
action.
See
them
in
love.
See
them
in
terror.
White
skin
on
the
black
market.
Soft
flesh
for
hard
cash.
"Women
in
Cages."
I'm
gonna
go
get
my
dick
wet.
She's
got
one
leg.
Easier
access.
You
got
a
point.
Get
the
rest
of
this
shit
upstairs
Yes,
sir.



Get
Lewis
down
here.
He's
getting
his
dick
wet,
sir.
Get
him
the
fuck
down
here
now!

Lewis?
Wilson?

Where
are
my
men?
I
have
got
several
right
here.

What
the
fuck's
this?
Their
balls,
sweetheart.
I'm
walking
out
of
here
-
Let
us
go.
Because
I
earned
it.
How
do
you
figure
that?
You
want
the
story?
A
termite's
nest
of
caves
me
and
my
men
walking
around
and
our
balls
in
our
throats,
-
Bin
Laden.
For
once,
our
intel
I
come
around
a
corner--
Bam,
there
he
is,
Wait.
You
killed
bin
Laden?
I
put
two
in
his
heart,
So
that
was
you.
Yeah.
That
was
me.
Class-A
cluster-fuck.
He
wasn't
supposed
to
be
there,
and
I
sure
as
fuck
wasn't
supposed
to
be
So,
instead
of
a
chest
full
of
medals,
No
cure.
That
is,
not
until
we
found
willing
to
sell
us
batches
of
this
shit.
Science
comes
first,
but
business
WRAY:
Then
you
realized
if
you
could
the
experiment
and
its
survivors,
you
would
find
a
cure.
I
swore
to
my
men
to
keep
them
alive.
And
that's
what
I
intend
to
do,
Wray.

Understand?
I
never
had
a
choice.

Neither
do
l,
sir.
God
bless
you

You
are
a
doctor?
Heh.
I
was
earlier
tonight.
I
always
wanted
to
be
a
doctor.
Instead,
I
can
do...
this.
Ohh.
Useless
talent
number
66.
I'm
very
pliable.
DAKOTA:
A
girlfriend
of
mine
She
said
at
some
point
in
your
life,
you
find
a
use
for
every
useless
talent
It's
like,
uh,
connecting
the
dots.
I'm
not
that
optimistic.
I
feel
like
I'm
sinking
down
the
drain
She
would
say...
when
you
are
stuck
in
that
spiral...
you
reach
up.
What
if
there's
nothing
up
there?
Just
reach
up.
You
are
a
dancer.
I
was
earlier
tonight.
Well,
I'm
pulling
you
out
of
retirement!

Get
your
ass
up!
Now,
I'm
starved
for
entertainment,
baby,
Radio!
Wail,
baby,
now!

Going
to
a
party...

That's--
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
Dance
it
up.
Keep
dancing!

'Cause
now.
I'm
jaded...

I
have
seen
me
but
ain't
never
seen
me
I
have
seen
me
a
stripper
and
I
have
seen
me
a
stripper
and
I
have
seen
me
a
stripper
but
I
ain't
never
seen
me
And
I
have
been
to
Morocco.
Dance,
bitch!
Break
a
leg!
Break
it
off!
Ha
ha!

Dance
for
me,
motherfucker.
-
Uhh!
Aah!
Ohhhh!

You
thought
it
was
pretty
funny,
Actually,
yes.
You
gave
me
some
wood,
now
I'm
gonna
give
you...
some
fucking
wood!
Ah--ah!


Ahh!
The
gas!
You
need
your
gas!
No!
Fuck
the
gas,
fuck
it.
I'm
just
gonna
have
to
make
this
quick.


Aah!
Uhh!
Where
would
you
get
that?
Useless
talent
number
37.
Aaaaah!



Uhh!
Uhh!
I
broke
my
leg.
That's
okay.

I
do
believe
in
you.
Always
have.
I
believe
that
you
could
be
better.
You
deserve
better,
even
better
than
me.
Right
now,
I
need
you
to
become...
who
you
are
meant
to
be.
Stand.

I
would
stand
clear
if
I
were
you.

Open
that
door,
will
you,
baby?
Uhh!


They
have
destroyed
most
of
the
tanks.
Any
that
are
left
There
are
two
helicopters,
big
enough
to
take
all
of
us.
Who
can
fly?
Can
anyone
else
fly
a
helicopter?
I
can
fly,
but...
no
way
in
hell
I'm
gonna
fly
tonight.
Okay.
Cool.
I
will
fly.
Let's
go.
I
think
we
are
gonna
stay
here,
Wray.
You
will
take
care
of
this
for
me,
With
pleasure.
Three
minutes.
Your
brother's
a
good
man,
J.T.
Best
in
Texas.
Hop
on.
No,
the
other
way.
Oh.
No.
The
other
way.


The
helicopters
are

We
make
a
run
for
it!
No!
If
we
all
get
killed,
Don't
you
get
it?
We
are
the
antidote.
Well,
is
there
another
way
around?
Wait
here.


I
don't
suppose
there
are
any
other
Take
that
as
a
no.
We
have
to
get
over
that
wall!
I
was
thinking
we
could
build
us
right
there
where
the
old
one
was.
You
cook,
I
work
the
back.
You
don't
make
that
rent
We
share
the
recipe,
Start
at
250
degrees.
I
knew
it.
For
how
long?
-
12
pounds?
12
pounds,
12
hours.
Wrapped
in
tin
foil,
right?
I
don't
use
no
goddamn
foil.
Damn.
Tomatoes?
Fresh?
Canned.
-
No
shit?
You
score
me
some?
Oh,
yeah.
'Cause
we
are
brothers.
Thank
you
for
this.
You
just
remember...
you
got
to
take
this
recipe

I
think
I
can...


That's
our
cue.
Cherry,
darling...
it's
all
you.


Let's
go!



Aah!
Wray!
Damn
it,
Wray.
Ohh.
Okay.
You
need
to
get
up
They
told
me
I
would
find
you
here.
I
was
beginning
to
lose
hope.
I'm
sorry...
but
I
lied.
I
did
want
to
hurt
you.
My
turn.

No
more
dead
bodies
Never
did
like
that
son
of
a
bitch.
About
as
useless
Don't
touch
anything.
I
want
to
fly
it.
-
He
said
not
to
touch
anything!
-
I
do
know
what
I'm
doing!
-
Shut
up!
Shut
up!
and
don't
fucking
touch
anything!

Everybody
sit
down!
Whoo!

Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

Hit
the
wipers.
Go
on,
leave
me.
I
am
not
leaving
you
here
like
this.
Motherfuckers
around
here

See?
I'm
funny.
I
made
you
laugh.
Go
to
the
ocean.
Put
your
backs
to
it.
I'm
not
leaving
you,
Wray.

It

I
promise.
I
never
miss.
Don't
worry,

You

find
your

CHERRY:
It's
like
you
said
I'm
like
you
said
I
would
be.
I
find
the
lost...
the
weary...
those
that
have
no
hope.
I
find
them
and
I
lead
them...
to
a
land
we
have
made
for
ourselves.
The
land
by
the
sea.




It's
beautiful.
She's
beautiful.
I
wish
you
could
see
us,
us
two.
It's
like
you
said
it
would
be.
Two
against
the
world,
baby.
Two
against
the
world.
This
film
is
a
brilliant
achievement
in

Finally,
the
truth
about
Hitler's
diabolical
plans
'Werewolf
Women
of
the
SS'
Welcome
to
Death
Camp
13.
Home
of
the
Nazis'
diabolical
plan.
To
create
an
army
of
super
werewolf
soldiers.
This
is
projected.
Its
failure
will
be
your
demise...
...
and
the
end
of
Germany,
Borman.
Hail,
Hitler!
You
have
been
chosen.

Rejoice.

I
have
found
the
perfect
solution.
The
She-Devils
of
Belzac.
Can
they
alone
supply
the
blood

Or
with
the
pride
of
Germany
fall
into
ruin?
This
is
my
project.
We
are
now
in
total
control
of
"Pure
Wolf".
This
is
an
outrage!

JUNGLE
JULIA:
We
can't
be
late!
We
won't!
Who's...
who's
holding?
If
you
are
not,
then
nobody.
We
were
kind
of
hoping
you
were.
-
Yeah.
How
are
you
not
holding?
It
is
not
my
fucking
job
to
supply
y'all
Whoa,
whoa,
You
are
getting
angry
kind
of
quick,
I
was
just
teasing
you!
I'm
not
angry.
if
y'all
didn't
just
count
on
me
and
surprise
me
Okay,
mean
girl
Are
you
through
I'm
not
having
a
tantrum.
Come
on,
don't
fight.
One,
it
is
not
about
the
money.
And
two,
we
are
not
really
fighting.
Arlene,
you
have
forgotten
what
That
wasn't
a
fight.
That
was
Julia
and
me
calling
her
on
it
Oh!
Billboard!

Okay,
is
Christian
Simonson
You
bet
your
ass
he
is...
Christian
Simonson,
He's
got
a
big
thing
for
Julia.
If
he
had
a
big
thing
for
me,
as
opposed
to
disappearing
and
he
would
get
his
ass
down
here
And
on
my
birthday
But
other
than
that
he's
putty
So
what's
the
plan,
man?
Margaritas
and
Mexican
touch
base
with
Chris
and
Jesse,
and
make
damn
sure
they
come.
Those
other
guys
will
be
waiting
for
us
Oh,
shit.
Speaking
of
which...
what
happened
Well,
you
know,
not
much.
If
you
don't
bust
their
balls
a
little
bit,
Okay,
we
are
pretty
clear
How
about
enlightening
us
Oh,
nothing
to
write
home
about.
We
just
made
out
on
the
couch
Dressed,
half-dressed,
or
naked?
Dressed.
I
said
we
made
out.
Oh,
excuse
me
for
living,
You
know,
it's
everything
but.
They
call
that
"the
thing"?
I
call
it
"the
thing.
"
Do
guys
like
"the
thing"?
They
like
it
better
than
"no
thing.
"
Okay,
I
wanna
get
back
So
you
are
making
out
Correct.
Whose
couch?
What
am
I,
stupid
over
here?
Mine.
Were
you
making
out
We
started
sitting
up,
Hmm.
The
plot
thickens.
I
was
straddling
him.
-
So
what
about
tonight?
I
mean
I
like
Nate.
But
it
ain't
a
done
deal.
Yeah,
fuck
Nate.
I
mean,
he's
cute
and
all,
but
Jesse
Letterman
Jessie
Letterman
the
Austin
director
He's
a
good
friend.
Maybe
they
can
bring
some
pot.
Fuck
that.
No.
I
don't
wanna
be
either
A,
or
B,
depending
on
their
ass.
Uh-uh.
If
we
don't
score
ourselves,
we
are
gonna
be
stuck
with
them
Ooh!
Try
Lanna-Frank.
Best
idea
you
had
all
day.
Oh,
hey!
That's

JULIA:
Shh!

don't
know
nothing
about
it.
-
Know
about
what?
-
Soon.
Yeah,
now
thanks
to
you,
All
right,
cut
the
shit.
I
said
a
little
something-something
Julia,
what
the
fuck
All
I
said
was
I
had
who
was
in
from
out-of-town
and
we
would
be
going
out
and
if
they
were
out
on
the
town,
And
I
described
you,
and
I
said
if
they
would
do
something,
Okay,
now,
Julia,
I'm
serious.
What
did
you
say
Anyhow,
I
could
explain
what
I
said,
or
Marcy
over
here,
who
is
an
incredible
actress,
which
I
think
will
give
you
a
better
idea
Okay,
so
just
tell
me
your
way.
-
So
we
will
act
it
out
with
Marcy?
Okay,
give
Marcy
your
drink.

Okay,
so
you
are
and
Marcy's
a
kind
of
cute
or
better
be
but
not-funny-looking
guy
Got
it.
Okay,
Marcy,
take
it.




your
name
wouldn't
be
Yes,
it
is,
and
it
seems
Barry.
Pleased
to
meet
you,
Barry.
Y'all
are
getting
me
hot!
Shh!
So
is,
uh...
Yes,
it
is.
And
how
would
you
know
I
listened
to
Jungle
Julia's
show
Oh,
you
did,
did
you?
Oh,
yeah,
I
listen
to
her
show
Oh,
you
do,
do
you?
Yeah,
she's
like
Don't
you
think
Nah,
man!
She
got
a
black
girl's
ass.

but
in
actual
fact,
she
doesn't
She's
got
a
'big'
ass.
Okay,
what
the
fuck
Look
who
wants
Okay,
we
will
get
to
the
point,
but
for
your
information,
black
men
and
a
whole
lot
have
had
plenty
of
fun
I
don't
wear
their
teeth
marks
If
you
are
not
gonna
buy
me
a
drink,


can
I
buy
you
a
drink?
I
would
love
one.
What
can
I
get
ya?
I
will
take
a
margarita.

Here
ya
go.
So,
after
they
buy
you
a
drink
when
they
raise
they
look
you
dead
in
the
eye
"The
woods
are
lovely,
And
I
have
promises
to
keep
Did
you
hear
me,
Butterfly?
"Miles
to
go
before
you
sleep.
"
And
then,
if
they
say
that...
you
gotta
give
them
a
lap
dance.
-
BUTTERFLY:
What?
If
they
call
you
"Butterfly,
"
you
gotta
give
them
a
lap
dance.
That's
bullshit.
Well,
you
can
do
it
or
not,
everybody
in
Austin
And
I
don't
think
you
want
thinking
you
are
a
chicken
shit.
I
ain't
giving
nobody
no
lap
dance
Look.
You
don't
have
to
do
it
I
said
you
would
do
it
So,
some
geek
comes
over
just
tell
him
you
already
did
it
No
harm,
no
foul,
But
maybe
a
little
later
you
have
had
a
few
drinks,
you
are
kind
of
loosey-goosey,
you
are
safe
with
your
girls,
then
some
kind
of
cute,
hysterically
funny,

maybe
you
did

earlier,

mean,
he
shows
me
a
guy
falls
off
a
horse,
he
says
it's
him.

You
know
the
show
'The
Virginian'?
Yeah,
well,
there
was
another
and
I
looked
like
him
a
bit--
well,
obviously
Tsk.
Aww,
I
like
it.
Well,
damn,
if
you
ain't
so
sweet
Anyway,
I
did
a
lot
of
'Virginians'
And,
uh...
then
that
show
turned
they
brought
on
Lee
Majors,
From
that
point
on
Yeah,
I
did
damn
near
I
was
Robert
Urich's
driving
double.
And
then
Bob
and
he
brought
me
And
after
that...
Do
you
know
any
of
these
shows
Sorry.
-
No?
No,
no.
So
how
exactly
does
one

Well,
in
Hollywood,
anybody
fool
enough
can
usually
find
somebody
But
really
I
got
into
the
business
the
way
How's
that?
-
My
brother
got
me
in
it.
Stuntman
Bob.



I'm
ready
to
blaze!
Finally,
yeah.
-
Now
the
party
can
start.
Anyhow,
I'm
sorry.
But
you
have
to
be
real
nice
to
me
Promise.
Mm-hmm.
-
How
about
your
friend,
bring
him?
If
you
really
want
him
to
come,
So
how
about
it?
Mmm,
us
girls.
Good
idea.

STUNTMAN
MIKE:
Ladies?
Thanks.
Cheers,
Butterfly.
"The
woods
are
lovely,
"And
I
have
promises
to
keep,
And
miles
to
go
Did
you
hear
me,
Butterfly?
"Miles
to
go
Sorry,
Stuntman
Burt--
Mike.
Mike.
She
already
broke
off
that
dance.
Is
that
true?
Did
I
miss
my
chance?
Do
I
frighten
you?
Is
it
my
scar?
It's
your
car.
Ah,
yeah,
I
know.
Sorry.
It's
my
mom's
car.

Have
you
been
following
us?

No,
but
that's
it's
just
so
damn
small.
-
You
have
seen
this
guy
before?
And
I
saw
you
outside
Guero's,
too.
You
saw
my
car,
Now,
look,
I
ain't
stalking
y'all,
So
you
really
weren't
following
us?
I'm
not
following
you,
Butterfly.
So,
how
about
that
lap
dance?
Sorry,
it
was
a
one-time
only
offer,
and
she
did
it
-
No,
she
didn't.
I'm
good
that
way.
-
Tsk.
And
you
look
a
little
touchd.
Wounded,
slightly.
Why
should
I
be
wounded?
Because
you
expected
guys
but
from
your
look
I
can
tell
That
kind
of
hurt
your
feelings
There
are
few
things
as
fetching
So...

How
about
that
lap
dance?
I
think
I'm
going
Well,
since
you
will
be
leaving
that
rain
check
will
be
worthless.
But
that's
okay.
I
understand
You
are
still
a
nice
girl.
And
I
still
like
you.
But
I
must
warn
you
of
something.
You
know
how
people
say,
"You
are
okay
in
my
book,
"
or,
"In
my
book,
that's
no
good.
"
Well,
I
actually
have
a
book.
And
everybody
And
now
I
have
met
you,

Except...
I'm
afraid
I
must
file
you...
under...
"Chicken
Shit."
And
what
if
I
did
it?
Well,
I
definitely
couldn't
then,
now,
could
I?
What's
your
name
again?
-
Stuntman
Mike.
I'm
Butterfly.
My
friend
Jungle
Julia
over
here
says
Yeah,
it
is.

Well,
why
don't
you
go

I'm
driving.

We
are
gonna
go
somewhere
else,
Ready
to
go?
Yeah.
-
Bye.
I
think
you
got
Mike
laid
tonight.

Looking
good,
Cannonball
Run!
He's
just
giving
me
a
ride.
Oh,
no
doubt.
Have
a
nice
ride!

Look,
double
fucks.

I
am
not
gonna
fuck
him.
I
can
hear
you.

-
He's
old
enough
to
be
my
dad.

Bye.
Bye-bye!

Wow,
that's
fucking
scary.
Yeah,
well,
I
wanted
it

Is
it
safe?
No,
it's
better
than
safe.
It's
death-proof.
How
do
you
make
a
car
death-proof?
Well,
that's
what
stuntmen
do.
You
have
seen
a
movie
where
there
ain't
no
way
in
hell
Yeah.
Well,
how
do
you
-
CGI?
Well,
unfortunately,
Pam,
nowadays
Tsk.
But
back
'Vanishing
Point'
days,
the
'White
Line
Fever'
days...
real
cars
smashing
into
real
cars.
Real
dumb
people
driving
them.
So,
give
the
stunt
team
they
take
her
and
reinforce
Voila!
You
got
yourself
That
makes
sense.
I
just
didn't
know
Well,
I
can
drive
this
baby
into
Just
for
the
experience.


Why
is
your
passenger
seat
in
a
box?
Well,
this
is
a
movie
car.
Sometimes
when
you
are
shooting
a
crash,
you
know,
shoot
the
crash
That's
where
you
put
the
camera.


-
There
you
go.
You
know,
when
you
you
didn't
mention
your
car
Yeah,
well,
actually,
You
asked
me
for
a
ride,
But
look
at
the
bright
side,
Pam--
I
won't
be
getting
fresh,

That
is
a
bright
side.
I
thought
so.






Well,
Pam...
which
way
are
you
going?
-
Left
or
right?
Ah,
that's
too
bad.
Why?
Well,
because
it
was
a
50/50
shot
You
see,
we
are
both
going
left.
You
could
have
just
and
if
that
was
the
case,
it
would
have
been
a
while
But
since
I'm
afraid...
you
are
gonna
immediately.
What
the
fuck?!

Cock
sucking
motherfucker!
Just
fucking
let
me
out
of
here!
I
will
fucking
rip
your
fucking--
Stop
the
fucking
car!
Why
are
you
being
such
a
shit?







Okay.
Here's
the
thing.

This...
is
all
a
joke.
A-hah!
Super
funny!
It's...
really
funny,
Okay?
But,
um...
And,
if--
if--
if--
if--
--If...
...
if
you
just
drop
me
off?

-
I
swear
I
won't
say
anything--
Remember
when
I
said

This
car
is
100%
death
proof.
Only
to
get
the
benefit
of
it,
honey...
you
really
need
to
be
sitting
in
my
seat.






Now
I
gotta
catch
me

No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's
Dave
Dee,
Dozy,
So,
you
got
it?

SHANNA:
I
want
to
hear



Do
you
remember
anything?

Uh...
I...
I
don't
remember.

EARL:
Doctor
Block.

WOMAN:

Self-restraints
to
Room
310.

Well.
What's
the
patient's
I
don't
really
see
Come
on
now,
Sis.
You
just
tell
us.
How
bad
is
he?
He
got
banged
up
real
good.
Busted
nose,
broken
collarbone,
Is
that
it?
He
was
real
lucky.

That
will
be
all?
Well,
that's
more
than
enough,

So,
Pop.
What
do
you
think?
Well,
Son
Number
One,
what
I
think
is
so
goddamn
ghoulish
Well,
give
it
a
shot.
Well,
what
we
have
here
That
ol'
boy
in
there
I
mean,
he
used
a
car,
not
a
hatchet,
Well,
what
are
you
gonna
do?
Not
a
goddamn
thing.
D.A.
says
there
ain't
no
crime
here.
Every
one
of
them
gals
was
swimming
and
old
Hooper
in
there
Now,
you
actually
think
that
he
Well,
I
can't
prove
it.
But
since
thinking
don't
cost
nothing,
Yeah,
but
Pop,
he
got
Well,
hell
yeah,
I
mean,
them
pretty
little
gals
in
there
chewed
them
up
and
spit
them
out.
Did
any
of
them
survive?

Two
tons
of
metal,
flesh
and
bone
they
all
princess
died.
Why?

EARL:
Well,
I
would
guesstimate
The
only
way
I
can
figure
it.
High-velocity
impact,
all
four
souls
taken
Probably
the
only
way
that
diabolical

Your
timing
couldn't
be
better,
Zoe.
It
just
so
happens
we
are
all
three
Fucking
hell!
How
does
that
happen?
I'm
doing
Lindsay
Lohan's
makeup,
There's
no
stunts
being
filmed
and
Lee's
on
a
will-notify
So
how
the
hell's
the
shoot
going?
Great.
We
are
having
the
best
time.
The
director,
Cecil
Evans,
is
so
much
fun.
We
are
making
the
coolest
movie
Hell,
yeah.
The
next
job
So
let's
hear
it,
ladies.
Set
romances!
Who's
getting
it
off?
That
would
be
Lee
and
Toolbox.
Oh,
Toolbox!
-
He's
a
grip.
Well,
he
just
keeps
sounding
What's
his
perversion?
He
likes
to
watch
me
pee.
#
Lee
is
sitting
on
a
toilet
#
P-l-S-S-l-N-G
#
Ooh!
Yeah,
but
not
no
more.
Now
she's
getting
it
on
You
had
a
one-off
with
the
Rock?
Well,
not
the
real
Rock.
And
Kim
started
calling
him
the
Rock,
so
now
we
all
just
call
him
the
Rock.
Kim,
dick
department.
Mm-mmm,
no
dick
this
trip.
-
How
long
have
you
had
this
boyfriend?
Who
would
you
steal
him
from?
Nobody!
ABBIE:
Kim!
He
totally
had
a
girlfriend.
ZOE:
All
of
Kim's
boyfriends
start
out
I
did
not
steal
him!
I
didn't
steal
any
of
them;

-
So
what's
your
story,
Abernathy?
I
had
a
set
crush
on
Cecil.
Set
crush?
Nigga,
please.
"Were"
and
"had"
being
Bitch,
you
two
are
still
Yeah,
well,
if
he's
so
in
love
with
me,

Yes,
men
are
dogs.
Oh,
it's
so
funny!
Stop
acting
all
hurt.
Yeah,
he's
a
stand-in
fucker.
Bitch,
You
need
to
get
over
that
shit.
Oh,
well,
now
you
put
it
like
that...
Oh,
I
haven't
told
you
the
best
part.
He
fucked
her
on
my
birthday.
Oh,
that's
a
horse
of
a
different
color.
-
Thank
you.
I
mean,
he's
the
director.
He
ate
a
piece
of
my
birthday
cake,
-

Wow.
What
did
he
get
you?
He
made
me
a
tape.
He
made
you
a
tape?
-

He
made
you
a
tape?
-
Yeah.
Yes,
I
know
what
you
are
gonna
say,
This
sounds
like
the
test
Look,
I
know
you
guys
like
him.
But
he
fucked
another
woman
How
can
you
not
be
on
my
side?
I
admit,
that
sounds
bad.
It
is
bad!
It
just
sounds
like
there's
Were
you
two
fucking?
Hell,
no.
Hello,
is
your
name
Abernathy?
Sorry.
The
answer
to
your
question
What
do
you
mean
"No,
of
course
not"?
The
reason
Cecil
hasn't
had
is
because
girls
will
fuck
him,
you
don't
become
one
not
to
say
I
want
to
be
his
girlfriend,
but
if
I
did
want
to
be
his
girlfriend,
I
would
be
one
of
his
regulars,
-
Have
you
let
him
do
anything?
I
have
let
him
give
me
a
foot
massage,
and
when
we
go
to
the
movies,
Bitch,
you
might
be
acting
but
he
just
acting
like
a
man.
You
need
to
break
Let
me
get
this
straight--
you
are
not
fucking
him,
you
are
not
giving
him
any
tongue,
You
know
some
cultures
might
say

So
Zoe,
Kim,
and
I
are
-
LEE:
What
were
you
working
on?
And,
admittedly,
-
ZOE:
(giggling]
Cheers
to
that.
Cheers.
So
Zoe...
the
genius,
wants
to
take

It's
dark
as
hell,
So
she's
got
her
camera
So
I
do.

So
I
step
back
a
little
fu
-ther.
Then
I
realize
I'm
at
the
edge

and
broken
bottles
and
rats
in
it,
I
probably
would
have
broken
my
neck.
So
I
am
yelling
at
her:
So
we
laugh
about
it
and
Zoe
starts
fucking
around.
And...
bam!...
if
she
doesn't
fall
LEE:
Nice.
Thank
you.
Yep.
Thank
you.
I
remember
taking
a
step
just
as
I'm
thinking,
"There's
that
ditch
Bam!
I'm
in
the
fucking
ditch,
you
know.
What
happened?
What,
with
Zoe,
the
cat?
Nothing.
If
I
fell
in
that
fucking
thing,
they
would
Zoe
just
lands
on
her
feet.
But
then
later
I
started
feeling
Zoe
falls
in
the
ditch
and
it's
nothing.
If
I
fell
in
that
fucking
thing,
Oh,
honey,
you
can't
think
like
that.
We
all
have
our
individual
talents,
Well,
physically
speaking,
I
mean,
agility,
reflexes,
nimbleness?
There's
few
human
beings
that
can
fuck
Kim,
I
like
you
too.
Having
said
that,
before
you
get
you
are
missing
the
most
You
didn't
fall
in
the
ditch.
Zoe
even
knew
there
was
a
ditch
there
and
she
still
fell
in.
So
Lee's
right.
Hey,
I
resemble
that
remark.

So
Kim,
you
still
pack
a
Roscoe?
Check
it
out,
bitch.
-
Ooh,
nice
one,
mate.
LEE:
What's
a
Roscoe?
Roscoe's
a
pistol.
-
You
carry
a
gun?
You
have
a
license
to
carry?
Yeah,
when
I
became
a
Secret
Service
Oh,
I
didn't
know
you
were...
Okay,
I
didn't
say
it,
all
right?
Did
you
know
Kim
carried
a
gun?
Yes.
Now,
do
I
approve?
No.
Do
I
know?
Yes.
Look,
I
don't
know
what
but
the
world
I
live
in,
You
can't
get
around
the
fact
tend
to
get
shot
And
you
can't
get
around
the
fact
at
midnight
enough
times,
Don't
do
your
laundry
at
midnight.
Fuck
that!
I
wanna
do
my
laundry
There
are
other
things
you
can
carry
Uh,
motherfucker
trying
to
rape
me,
I
wanna
shut
that
nigga
down!
How
about
a
knife,
at
least?
Yeah,
you
know
what
happens
They
get
shot!
If
I
ever
become
a
famous
actress,
I
will
hire
me
a
do-dirt
nigga
and
he
will
I
will
sit
back
and
laugh,
So
Zoe,
you
thought
about
It
just
so
happens
Oh,
really?
To
me,
there's
no
point
in
being
in
America
I
wanna
drive
a
Dodge
Challenger--

ABBIE:
Well,
I
guess
we
but
does
it
have
to
be
Not
just
that.
It
has
to
be
a
1970

How
in
the
fuck
No
worries,
mate.
I
have
got
it
all
worked
out.
When
I
knew
I
was
coming
here,
that
the
local
paper
here
in
Tennessee
-
So
back
home...

What
do
you
mean
by
that,
mate?
Zoe's
from
New
Zealand,
I
repeat,
never--
KIM:
That
is,
unless
I'm
so
sorry.
I
will
nev--

Oh,
it's
okay.
We
are
just
taking
the
piss
Auckland,
to
answer
your
question.
Anyway,
I
subscribed
Why
the
fuck
you
want
a
local
redneck
Pipe
down
and
I
will
tell
you.
I
have
been
getting
the
paper
looking
at
cars
for
sale,
so
as
of
yesterday,
some
dude
is
selling
with
a
440
engine
and
a
white
paint
job.
KIM:
And
you
wanna
buy
it?
Kim,
I
may
be
stupid,
I
wanna
say
I
wanna
buy
it
A
1970
Dodge
Challenger
Oh,
uh,
Kowalski!
Kowalski
from
'Vanishing
Point'.
If
I
can
get
this
guy
to
let
me
drive
it
without
him,
ABBIE:
What's
'Vanishing
Point'?

you
will
excuse
me,
You

your
time.


What
are
you
waiting
for?
I
intend
to,
but
first
I
need
What?
If
he
lets
us
take
it
out
on
our
own,
-
Oh,

Ain't
no
way
I'm
doing
Ship's
Mast.
-
For
Chrissakes...
Sorry.
Now,
what
did
you
say
-
Look,
I
know
what
I
said.
-
I
know
I
said
we
shouldn't...
You
didn't
say
we
shouldn't.
-
But...
You
said
not
only
are
we
never
but
you
also
said
if
you
ever
do
to
not
only
refuse,
but
that
I
had
permission
Now,
did
you
or
did
you
not
say
that?
No,
no,
no.
-
Did
you
or
did
you
not
say
that?
-
However...
Look,
I
know
I
said
it,
Damn
skippy
you
meant
it!
But
when
I
said
it,
-
Oh,
nigga,
please.
I
meant
we
should
never
play
Ship's
Mast
You
are
such
a
liar!
I
know
what
I
said,
but
when
I
said
it
and
if
I
had
of
known
had
the
opportunity
to
play
Ship's
Mast
I
would
have
added
a
"however.
"
Right?
Okay,
oddly
enough,
However,
just
because
doesn't
mean
I
have
lost
You
need
two
people
to
play
Ship's
Mast,
I
will
be
your
best
friend.
I
don't
need
me
no
best
friend
I
will
crack
your
back.
You
will
crack
it
anyway.
Well,
of
course
I
will
crack
it
anyway.
But
now,
while
I'm
here,
Whenever
you
want
it,
you
have
got
it.
You
just
order
me
to
do
it,
just
be
like,
We
are
gonna
see
if
this
guy
will
let
us
If
he
does,
you
wait
here
with
Lee
What?
-
I
said
we
are
gonna
see
if
this
guy
will
let--
I
just
can't
believe
You
two
got
some
fucking
balls.
What?
Don't
play
dumbass
with
me.
I
have
been
up
all
night,
I'm
still
a
little
drunk,
I
should
be
in
my
hotel
room,
asleep,
but
because
Zoe
wanted
to
drive
Now
you
two
got
the
balls
to
ask
me--
I
gotta
go
make
conversation
with
Tom
Joad
Bullshit
on
that.
-
It
ain't
like
that.
You

are
our
collateral.
I
really
think
one
human
being
You
are
not
gonna
What,
drive
a
car?
We
are
doing
more
than
that.
What,
drive
it
fast?
We
are
doing
more
than
that.
Actually,
we
are
paying
you
a
compliment,

But
that's
okay.
We
are
stunt
people.
But
you
got
good
sense,
-
ain't
gonna
want
to
do
what
we
are
doing.
'Cause
you
are
a
mum.
Yeah.
You
know,
we
are
supposed

that's
the
excuse
you
guys
use
so

is
it
you
two
daredevils
are
doing
that
I'm
just
so
uncool
You
know,
we
are
kind
of
conning
this
guy,
so
maybe
it's
best
if
we
don't
go
Besides...
he's
probably
not
gonna
Okay,
how
about
this?
I
will
talk
him
into
it,
-
How

gonna
do
that?
But
don't
worry.

He
will
say
yes.
What
are
you
gonna
do,
blow
him?
No.
I'm
gonna
insinuate

That's
a
good
one.
Not
really.
But
let
me
handle
it.
Okay,
Mama,

up.
You
wanna
hang
with
the
cool
kids?
We
