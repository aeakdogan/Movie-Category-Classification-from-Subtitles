BECCA:
Mom,
honestly,
I
want
to

I
used
to
sing.
My
mother
used
to
say
but
I
know
she
was
hiding
behind
this
the
kitchen
towel
over
She
thought
I
had
a
better
voice
than
Olivia
Newton-John
My
father
was
We'd
take
these
long
walks
together,
I
used
to
wake
up
early
when

My
father
thought
that
meant
Anyway,
as
I
said
before,

The
day
I
left
My
parents
cursed
at
me.
I
moved
to
the
door
to
leave
and
I
hit
my
mother.
And
then
my
dad
hit
me,
and
then
we
kind
of
stood
there
in
shock,
They
reached
out
I
refused
to
I
know
you
were
trying
You
didn't
have
It
was
there


Please...
Don't
hold
Hear
me?


Blow
them
out!
Okay,
okay!

Yay!

I
may
be
13,
May
not
carry
no
chrome,
But
I'm
young
and
can
do
My
sister
tried
to
make
a

it
didn't
She
had
to
scream
and
kill
Chunks
in
her
hair
But
she
washed

here's
a
few
things
T-Diamond
Adult
diapers
There's
Attends
and
Depends
But
they
all
the
same
They
keep
your
mess
from
spilling
out
So
here's
the
truth
I
got
messed
up
with
a
killer
I
will
try
not
to
refrain
Try
to
overcome
my
pain
'cause
Like
50
Cent
getting
shot
I
got
a
diaper
shoved
in
I
thought
it
was
over
I
thought
I'd
be
under
the
ground
Some
dude
going
But
that's
not
what
happened
I
was
like
Mel
Gibson
I'm
straight
now,
For
three
weeks
that
diaper
I
had
to
use
two
whole
And
one
last
thing
But
the
truth
is
Oh,
Shania
