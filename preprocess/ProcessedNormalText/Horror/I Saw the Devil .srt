I
drove
out
to
the
orphanage
today.
I
go
every
month,
remember?
The
children
are
so
cute.
If
I
have
a
child,
maybe
I'll
raise
her
Show
her
flowers
and
trees.
The
tow
truck?
They
said
it'll
take
a
while.
I
love
your
voice.
It
feels
romantic
Hold
on
a
moment.
Got
a
flat
tire?
Yes,
I
called
a
tow
truck.
In
this
snow,
Hold
on.
I
said
it's
okay,
Really?
Just
wait
for
the
tow
truck.
No,
it's
not
hard
But
why
bother
Hold
on
a
sec.
Status?
Okay,
got
it.
Hello?
Ju-yeon?
Lock
the
doors
What?
Hold
on.
Love
is...
Sweet
like...
A
mother's...
Tow
truck's
on
its
way.
Why
does
he
bother?
Too
many
people
here
today.
Sorry
to
be
working
I'll
be
home
soon.
Your
car's
completely
sunk.
Thank
you,
but
I'll
just
wait
Thank
you.
STUDENT
SAFETY
VEHICLE
Why
isn't
he
leaving?
Mister...
Mister...
Wait...
Your
skin's
so
soft,
Please
don't
kill
me.
Why
not?
I'm...
pregnant.
Please,
let
me
live.
Dong-su!
Dong-su!
-
What?
Chief!
Stay
at
home.
What's
going
on?
What
happened
to
my
daughter?
Don't
look!
Nothing's
for
sure
yet.
-
Detective
Cho!
What's
this?
Move
it.
It
looks
like
a
head.
Flip
it.
Forensics!
We
found
the
head!
Look
after
Chief
Jang!
Chief!
Sir!
Ju-yeon!
Ju-yeon!
Stop
taking
pictures!
You
call
yourselves
humans?!
Block
them
off!
At
least,
heaven
helped
us.
Otherwise,
How
ironic.
I
was
a
police
detective
and
I
couldn't
even
protect
Stop
smoking,
sir.
I'm
sorry.
Really.
I'm
so
sorry.
To
you...
and
to
Ju-yeon...
I'm
so
sorry.
Forgive
me,
Ju-yeon.
I
wasn't
there
for
you.
Always
late...
Never
there
when
you
needed
me.
But
Ju-yeon...
I
promise
you
this.
I'll
make
him
pay
for
your
pain.
Soo-hyun...
For
how
long?
There's
no
rush.
All
I
need
is
two
weeks,
sir.
Take
more
days.
No,
I'll
see
you
in
two
weeks,
sir.
That'd
be
good
for
us...
But
are
you
sure?
Then
I'll
see
to
it.
Get
some
rest.
How
could
this
happen?
Didn't
he
get
engaged
I
don't
believe
this.
The
capsule
is
equipped
Cool,
isn't
it?
Good
job.
Thanks.
Sure.
Aren't
you
going
back?
Huh?
Anything
else
to
tell
me?
No.
Right.
As
you
know,
If
something
goes
wrong,
Don't
worry.
Nothing
will
go
wrong.
It
looks
like
the
police...
think
these
four
They've
been
accused
-
Hi,
Soo-hyun.
Did
you
have
dinner
already?
I'd
better
get
going.
I
brought
some
groceries
for
Dad.
I'll
be
going
then.
-
You're
leaving?
Shit.
Quiet!
Remember
this?
You
really
don't
know?
Fine.
Sir.
What
the
hell
is
with
him?
Says
he
killed
the
girl
found
And
the
missing
Shinchon
girl
case
All
of
a
sudden,
What
the
hell?
Who
did
this?
No,
sir.
An
ambulance
came
And
this
bastard
What
the
heck
happened?
Well,
he
didn't
say
anything
yet.
What
the
hell
happened
last
night?
Help...
me...
please.
Help...
me...
What's
he
saying?
Some
bastard
hammered
his
balls.
What?
That's
insane!
Who
broke
your
balls?
Who
are
you?
What
the
hell!
The
buses
have
stopped
running.
Pardon
me?
Where
are
you
going?
To
Sung-min
Apartments.
Sung-min?
Well,
it's
kinda
on
the
way.
I'll
give
you
a
ride.
It's
okay,
but
thanks.
I'll
give
you
a
ride.
Get
in.
No,
really.
It's
okay.
It's
just
down
the
road.
It's
fine.
You
sure
it's
on
your
way?
Don't
worry.
Get
in.
What?
Huh?
Nothing.
Is
this
a
school
van?
Ah...
shit.
Why?
Huh?
Why
do
you
look
Never
seen
a
thing
like
this?
Who's
there?
Why
do
you
need
this
I
have
to
identify
There
are
too
many
people
These
are
all
old
pictures.
Perhaps
this
one
would
do.
I'll
ask
a
few
more
Do
you
have
additional
I
don't.
Sang-won!
Sang-won!
Where'd
he
go?
I
think
it
was
Yang-pyung
Can
you
verify
that
this
person
is
Is
this
Mr.
Jang
Kyung-chul?
It's
Kyung-chul
alright.
But...
is
this
a
recent
picture?
Why
does
he
look
so
scary?
Insurance,
my
ass.
He
doesn't
give
a
shit
He
abandoned
his
parents
Like
he'd
really
take
out
It
doesn't
make
any
sense!
Don't
talk
like
that!
Am
I
wrong?
No
use
protecting
him.
-
Shut
up!
You
old
fool!
Shut
up!
How
can
you
say
that?
If
you
can't
say
something
nice,
Fuck!
By
the
way...
doesn't
the
family
get
the
money
Are
you
Sang-won?
Do
you
know
Shit!
Why?
She's
a
really
good
singer.
-
Maybe
I
can
go.
My
mom's
gonna
kill
me.
Go
straight
home,
girls.
Okay?
Yes,
ma'am.
Please
drive
them
straight
home.
Of
course.
-
Thank
you.
Shit.

Can
I
help
you?
-
Why?
Is
there
a
problem?
He's
driving
the
kids
home.
Shit.
Call
his
cell
phone,
now!
LEARNING
CENTER
Shit.
Do
not
cry
on
me.
Do
not
cry
like
a
baby.
Let's
see.
You
have
fair
skin.
It's
okay.
It'll
be
over
quick.
I
lost
my
damn
job.
Looks
like
things
are
fucked
up.
But...
Shit!
What's
wrong
with
that?
I
can
like
you
if
I
want.
Damn
bitches
in
the
world
I

Can't
I?
Shit.
It'll
be
over
quickly.
I'll

Of

Cars

The

Don't

so
weak.
Remember...
your
nightmare's

plug
your
ears.
Son

a
bitch!
Damn

You

huh?
Damn
son
of
a
bitch!
Motherfucker.
Fine!
Let's
see
who's
the
bitch
here!
What
happened,
sir?
Did
you
have
an
accident?
His
car
must've
stalled.
Damn
dogs.
Always
going
wild...
at
the
smell
of
blood.
Yes,
sir.
Is
everything
okay?
Just
worried
that's
all.
The
police
think
The
cops
are
after
him
I
was
thinking...
How
about
dropping
it
now?
-
Sir...
I
want
you
to
stop.
But,
sir...
Forget
it.
Talk
to
you
later.
It's
me.
Se-yeon.
-
Soo-hyun.
Good.
Well,
just
busy
Really?
You
know
what
I
do.
I'm
asking
about
Dad
gave
you
Soo-hyun?
I
know
how
you
feel,
It
won't
bring
her
back.
Whatever
you
do
to
punish
him,
Revenge
is
for
movies.
That
bastard's
a
psycho.
Sorry.
I
have
nothing
How
come?
We're
practically
family.
You
know
how
I
am
I
keep
looking
back,
And
you
have
nothing
to
say?
So,
please.
This
is
pointless.
Sorry,
I'd
better
go.
And
this
is
not
pointless.
Soo-hyun!
Water!
Get
me
water!
Aren't
you
sick
of
it?
Try
it.
You
can't
get
sick
of
it.
Once
you
taste
this,
you
can't
eat
any
other
meat.
Crazy
bastard.
What
did
you
just
say?
Why
you
little...
Gone
insane
from
Wake
up!
Yeah,
I
must
be
damn
crazy.
This
meat's
so
good,
Why
do
I
cry
when
I
get
tense?
Crazy
bastard.
Remember
when
we
first
met?
Trying
to
form
a
militant
group
Those
were
the
days.
We
weren't
afraid
of
anything!
Cut
the
bullshit
Bet
he's
a
family
member
If
not,
he's
some
total
maniac.
He's
our
kind.
He's
enjoying
the
excitement
Catching
and
letting
go
He's
playing
the
hunter.
He
relishes
torturing
his
prey.
Man...
I
think
you're
screwed
this
time.
The
bastard
must've
gone
crazy
You've
created
a
monster.
Get
some
sleep.
You
can
sleep
anywhere.
I'll
go
prep
my
next
meal.
Damn
bastards.
He's
enjoying
the
excitement
Catching
and
letting
go
He
relishes
torturing
his
prey.
He's
playing
the
hunter.
Your
nightmare's
Amusing...
Now...
I
used
up
all
the
guts?
Not
here,
either?
Then...
Shit.
Come
on.
Didn't
you
see
your
sister?
If
you
fight
it,
I'll
end
it
quickly
for
ya.
So
why
be
suspicious
of
us?
We
didn't
ask
for
money
Couldn't
let
us
in,
huh?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
really
sorry!
Should've
apologized
Damn
bitches.
Always
acting
up
Wait.
Hands,
feet,
Close
your
eyes.
Where
the
hell?
How'd
you
come
in
I'm...
pregnant.
I
was
wondering
about
you.
You
don't
look
like
a
monster.
Sick
bastard.
Hands,
feet,
then
head.
Just
like
you
did.
Nothing
more,
nothing
less.
You
sick
psychos!
Son
of
a
bitch.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why,
why...
Why...
I'm
actually
relieved.
You
had
me
worried
sick
It's
secret
agent
Want
me
to
show
you
Make
him
stop.
He
can't
become
a
monster
You
know
that's
wrong.
Where
is
he
now?
Your
wounds
are
treated.
You
and
that
bastard
What
happened?
Sir?
Hand
the
bastard
over.
I'm
far
from
done.
What
are
you
going
to
do?
You
know...
It
feels
like
a
huge
rock
is
Big
and
heavy.
I
promised
Ju-yeon
that
It's
not
over.
Far
from
it.
Okay,
no
more
questions.
By
the
way,
Unless
he
has
diarrhea...
Don't
worry.
He'll
be
out
Sir?
You've
changed
a
lot,
Hello.
Pain
killers,
please.
Dexi
what,
sir?
-
Just
give
me
the
strongest
kind.
Where
are
you?
Are
you
listening?
Of
course
you
are.
It's
been
a
blast.
You!
Want
me
to
guess
Your
bitch
was
Ju-yeon?
You
hear
me?
But,
you
made
a
mistake.
You
took
me
for
granted.
You'll
regret
not
killing
me.
I'll
get
you
soon.
Hello,
there.
Wait.
What
are
you
doing!
Hey,
you!
By
the
way...
before
she
died,
she
said...
that
she
was
pregnant.
Begged
for
her
life.
Did
you
know?
Go!
Go!
Get
here

I
have
a
question.
Where
might
our
friend
be?
You
ticked
off
the
wrong
guy.
He
always
gets
even.
Know
what
that
means?
First
your
girl,
then
her
family.
Then
he'll
give
himself
up
But...
your
woman
didn't
have
it
Unlike
me,

call.
I
was
tapping
the
cops

called
them.
