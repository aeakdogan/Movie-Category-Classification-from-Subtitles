I'm
not

I'm
sorry,
truly.
She
may
have
survived

Maybe
I
can

You're

You're
sick.
Just

Hey!
Hey,
no!
Oh,
my

Hey,

Come

This
is
Olivera.
We've
been
overrun.
We
need
to
find
somewhere
I
don't
think
that's
a
good
idea.
There
might
be
more
of
those...
...things.
If
there
were
more,
-
You
know
what
they
are?
...from
Umbrella
labs
How
come
you
know
so
much
I
used
to
work
for
them.
Damn
it.
Hold
it.
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
He's
wounded.
I'm
fine.
You
should
take
care
of
him
now.
It'll
be
more
difficult
later.
You
know
that.
No.
If
it
comes
to
that...
...I'll
take
care
of
it
myself.
As
you
wish.
It's
nothing
personal.
...you'll
be
dead.
And
moments
later,
You'll
endanger
your
friends,
...probably
succeed.
I'm
sorry.
That's
just
the
way
it
is.
Help
me!
There's
too
many
of

One
that
works.
Take
Yuri.
Hold
on,
Yuri.
Nicholai,
put
me
down.
Okay,
rest
here.
What
is
this?
Looks
like
weapon
cases.
We
don't
need
weapons.
These
weren't
meant
for
us.
Yuri!
Plenty
to
go
around.
Don't
shoot!
I
got
the
power.
Thank
you!
Owe
you
one,
man.
Shit!
Maybe
I
was
safer

Get

Oh,
shit.
Respect.
Those
were
some
pretty
slick
moves
I'm
good...
...but
I'm
not
that
good.
-
You
should
be
thankful
for
that.
They
did
something
to
me.
I
barely
feel
human
anymore.
We
should
keep
moving.
Keep
moving.

Hello?

Who

All

us?
What
do
you
mean?
We're

Nicholai.
Expendable
assets.
And

pretty
grown-up
name
I'm

Besides...
...all
my
friends

me
Angie.
I
like
that.
Those
things
are
in
here.
It's
okay,
honey.
They're
slow.
No.
Not
them.
Them.
Get
back.
Stay.
Thought
you
might
need
a
hand.

You
work
for
Umbrella?
Until
they
left
us
for
dead

this
place.
Sergeant
Nicholai
Genovev,

Come
on!
Save
the

I've
got
this
bitch.
Oh,

From
now
on,

It's

What
do
we
do
now?
Wait
here.
Eyes:
Okay?
Thank
you.
You
two
know
each
other?
She's
infected.
She's
infected
on
a
massive
level.
-
How
can
you
know
that?
You're
infected?
When
were
-
Let
me
see.
You
know
I'm
not
goanna
hurt
you.
Let
me
see.
It's
the
antivirus,
There's
a
cure?
How
did
you
get
this?
My
daddy.
He's
sick.
He
just
wanted
to
stop
that.
When
I
was
little...
...I
had
to
walk
on
crutches.
They
said
I'd
never
get
better,
He
found
a
way
The
T-virus.
Then
they
took
the
invention
Get
out
of
my
house!
He's
not
a
bad
man.
He
didn't
mean
for
any
of
this.
It's
okay.
Don't
shoot!
He's
cool.
He
made
a
deal
with
Dr.
Doom,
How
many
of
you
guys
are
there?
What
do
you
mean?
Nicholai.
When
were
you
bitten?
-
Three
hours
ago.
It's
your
lucky
day.
Should
have
told
me
you
got
bit.
-
Let
me
speak
to
my
daughter.
There's
a
helicopter
It
takes
off
in
47
minutes.
It'll
be
the
last
transport
to
leave
I
take
it
this
helicopter
isn't
No.
It
has
another
purpose,
-
Where's
the
evac
site?
-
Daddy?
-
Are
you
all
right?
Soon.
These
people
will
I'll
see
you
very
soon.
Put
the
lady
back
on.
Where
do
we
have
to
go?
The
helicopter
will
be
at
city
hall.
I
suggest
you
make
haste.
Computers...
...so
unreliable.
Just
like
people.
You
really
thought
I
didn't
know?
So,
what
are
you
injecting
me
with?
The
antivirus.
The
T-virus
reanimates
dead
cells.
Basically,
bringing
the
dead
to
life.
Or
in
a
living
human,
Or
it
can
help
her
walk
again,
-
Angie's
infected?
The
cellular
growth
is
enough
...but
not
enough
to
cause
mutation.
And
they
infected
you
Yeah.
But
don't
worry.
Here.
Tape
the
story.
My
name
is
Alice.
I
worked
for
the
...the
largest
and
most
powerful
I
was
head
of
security
at
a
secret
...a
giant
underground
laboratory
...viral

Let's
go.
You
missed
one.
We
have
to
hurry.
-
We're
okay.
We
have
time.
-
Holy
shit!
We
stealing
his
ride!
-
I
said,
take
off!
We've
been
expecting
you.
-
Perimeter
secure.
-
Angie!
-
I
knew
you
wouldn't
leave
me.
Discard
primary
weaponry.
The
two
of
you
showed
such
promise,
And
most
impressive
you've
been.
You're
like
brother
and
sister.
Heightened
speed,
strength,
Parallel
strands
of
research.
And
now...
Fight
him.
No.
Fight
him,
or
they
die.
What
makes
you
think
I
care?
Daddy!
Daddy,
no.
No.
He
was
a
valuable
asset
I
don't
even
care
Begin.
He's
mutating.
I
want
him

I'm
sorry.
Oh,
Matt.
I'm
so
sorry.
Finish
him.
I
said,
finish
him.
No.
No.
Don't
you
understand
That
creature
is
one
thing,
...somehow
you
bonded
You
adapted
it,
changed
it.
-
I
became
a
freak.
You're
not
mutation.
With
my
help,
just
imagine
What
about
him?
Evolution
has
its
dead
ends.
Now,
finish
this.
...and
come
with
me.
No.
You're
such
All
that
strength...
...but
no

it.
What
a

Angie,

Why
haven't
we

Surrender,
or
we

Drop

Alice!
Drop
your

surrender.
Let's

You

Matt...
Come

I
