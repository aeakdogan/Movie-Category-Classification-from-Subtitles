Take
them
into
the
forest
now.
You
stay
here.
I'll
be
back
soon.
-
Wait!
I
said,
stay
here!
Father!
Wait!
Help
us!
Please!
Hello!
Is
anybody
there?
Eat!
Eat!
Eat!
{Screaming}
This
oven's
not
hot
enough!
More
wood!
What?
Is
it
hot
enough
for
you
now?
My
sister
and
I
It
was
just
the
two
of
us.
But
we
learned
a
couple
of
things
One:
Never
walk
into
a
house
And
two:
If
you're
going
to
kill
a
witch,
set
her
ass
on
fire.
Fresh
milk!
Fresh
milk
for
the
children!
After
weeks
of
living
in
fear,
we
have
finally
caught
the
one
For
crimes
against
For
crimes
against
and
for
consorting
with
I
hereby
accuse
this
woman
of
the
craft
of
witchery!
Burn
her!
Burn
her!
Behold
the
eyes
of
the
demon.
Go
to
hell.
Order!
Order!
Berringer,
this
is
still
my
town.
Listen
to
me.
As
your
mayor,
I
know
only
too
well
that
many
of
you
witch
plague,
We
first
need
evidence.
We
can't
just
have...
You
know
a
witch
when
you
see
one!
They
ride
at
night
This
woman
will
burn!
Burn
her!
Burn
her!
Let
the
girl
go
all
over
these
fucking
hillbillies.
Move.
Go
on.
Let
her
go.
Go
over
there.
Check
her.
What's
your
name?
What's
your
name?
-
Mina.
When
a
woman
truly
deals
in
witchcraft,
A
nasty
rot
sets
in.
It
shows
in
her
teeth,
in
her
skin
and
her
eyes.
This
is
not
a
witch.
This
woman's
clean.
I'm
sure
your
sheriff
was
only
trying
But
your
mayor
has
done
He
hired
us.
My
name
is
Gretel,
and
this
is
my
brother,
Hansel.
We
know
that
many
of
your
children
But
killing
an
innocent
woman
Go
home!
We
don't
want
you
here!
We
don't
want
more
evil
in
Augsburg!
Well,
evil
is
upon
you,
Now
if
your
children
are
still
alive,
we
will
find
them.
you're
going
to
have
me
to
deal
with.
Now
go
home!
Go!
I
guess
you're
free
to
go.
Thank
you,
Hansel.
You're
welcome.
What
the
hell
do
you
think
That
woman
is
a
suspect
in
my
custody.
Any
man
with
half
a
brain
Now
listen,
Sheriff.
Hansel
and
Gretel
You
better
listen!
I'm
not
going
to
have
this
bitch
coming
into
my
town,
telling
me
what
to
do.
Don't!
Just
don't.
Come
on.
Let's
get
you
started.
There's
been
reports
of
Locals
won't
go
near
the
place.
A
good
place
to
start
the
investigation.
Move!
Gretel!
She
looks
angry.
Yeah.
A
face
like
that,
I'd
be
angry,
too.
Would
you
shut
up?
That
witch
we
found
No
trace
of
any
kids.
I'm
sorry.
But
we
found
this.
That
is
called
the
Blood
Moon,
Mayor.
An
eclipse
of
the
moon.
It
happens
once
in
a
generation
Oh,
my
God.
When?
According
to
this,
There's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
Children
being
taken
in
these
numbers
from
the
roads
and
fields
A
witch
does
not
come
out
Not
unless
she
has
to.
Witch
activity
More
sightings,
It
seems
the
coming
of
the
Blood
Moon
is
dragging
every
damned
witch
So,
it
seems
like
a
good
thing
that
you
brought
us
here,
Half
your
money
now.
The
rest
when
the
children
Oh,
there
he
is,
right
on
time.
This
is
Jackson.
And
he'll
take
you
to
where
Yeah.
We
can
be
there
in
a
few
hours.
Not
at
night.
It's
too
dangerous.
Not
at
night.
It's
too
dangerous.
We'll
leave
in
the
morning.
Yeah,
she's
right.
So,
any
place
Shut
up!
The
last
one
they
took
was
a
boy.
Less
than
two
days
ago,
100
shilling
for
every
child
You
better
be
fast
before
our
mayor's
witch
hunters
rob
this
town
blind.
You
leave
tonight.
In
witch
country
at
night?
You
must
be
out
of
your
mind.
I'm
telling
you,
we
should
put
the
fire
out.
We're
hunting
witches,
not
bears.
And
we
have
to
eat.
Such
beautiful
creatures.
Are
they
yours?
Yes,
ma'am.
Why
have
you
come
here?
To
the
dark
of
the
forest?
A
child
was
taken,
ma'am.
We're
here
to
find
him
There
are
no
children
here.
Here...
There's
only
death!
Witch!
Fools!
This
is
my
land!
How
dare
you?
Please?
Please,
God...
No.
There's
no
use
in
praying,
my
friend.
Even
your
God
knows
better
There
have
been
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
And
on
this
last
one,
we
believe
a
troll
was
involved.
-
A
troll?
Another
round.
It's
really
unusual.
Look
at
this
one.
A
father
and
three
children
attacked.
One
child
was
taken,
That's
weird.
That's
so
weird.
-
It
is
strange.
It
is
strange,
okay!
Then
again,
What's
normal,
really?
Excuse
me.
Hansel
and
Gretel?
Oh,
my
God,
I
can't
believe
you're
here.
I'm
Ben.
Benjamin
Walser.
I
am
really
quite
a
fan
of
your
work.
That's
great.
It's
nice
to
meet
you,
Benjamin.
Listen,
if
it's
not
too
much
trouble,
-
would
you
please
sign...
Okay.
Oh,
my.
Yeah,
that's
from
when
you
and
sank
her
in
the
moat.
And
this
one's
from
the
When
they
tried
to
put
a
gate
to
I
mean,
you
guys,
you
certainly
Wow.
This
is
amazing.
And
weird.
-
A
little
creepy.
You
really
keep
all
this
stuff.
All
right,
well...
I
just
have
so
many
questions.
-
You
know,
we
have...
-
You
go
ahead.
Okay.
How
do
you
best
kill
a
witch?
Hansel?
Cutting
off
their
heads
tends
to
work.
Ripping
out
their
hearts.
And
skinning
them
is
also
nice.
Yeah,
but
burning
is
the
best
way.
'Cause
that's
the
only
way
to
be
safe.
-
Burning,
yeah,
of
course.
Is
it
true
that
witches
can't
harm
you?
Well,
no,
that
is
horseshit,
son.
Their
magic
doesn't
work
on
us.
And
they
haven't
killed
us,
yet.
Do
you
think
that's
because
of
the
witch
that
you
burned
I
guess
that's
how
I
mean,
is
that
how
How
did
you
get
your
guns?
-
How
did
you
get
your
weapons?
There's
lots
of
things
to
do.
but
we
have
a
town
under
attack.
She
killed
them!
She
killed
them
all.
Who
killed
what?
The
witch!
She
killed
the
trackers.
All
of
them.
She
gave
me
a
message.
For
you
all.
The
Curse
of
Hunger
I
fucking
hate
that
one.
That
was
awesome.
It's
working.
It's
not
even
warm.
Muriel,
this
could
change
everything.
It
will
change
everything.
We
will
be
invincible.
Take
it
out.
Take
it
out!
Take
it
out!
It's
of
no
use
if
it
doesn't
last.
I
can
make
it
last.
Forever.
Where
are
we
going?
We're
almost
there.
Hey.
Hey.
I
just
had
this
really
weird
dream.
-
Oh,
yeah?
About
what?
I
think
it
was
about
our
mother.
We
don't
talk
about
that.
Go
to
sleep.
What
do
you
think?
Boy,
girl?
Okay.
Here
you
go.
I'll
take
this.
A
little
small
for
you,
maybe.
Oh,
hello.
No,
this,
this
is...
This
is
not
for
me.
So,
how
goes
the
witch
hunting?
It's
good.
Witch
hunting's
good.
It's
strange
being
among
these
people.
Yeah?
If
you
hadn't
come,
Yeah,
well,
I
probably
but
I'm
old-fashioned
that
way.
My
sister,
however,
before
someone
gets
roasted.
Have
you
ever
come
across
a
witch
No,
never.
The
only
good
witch
is
a
dead
witch.
Can
you
hold
this?
Are
you
all
right?
Yeah.
When
I
was
a
kid,
a
witch
made
me
eat
Something
happened
to
me.
every
few
hours
or
else
I
die.
You
have
the
sugar
sickness.
I
actually
know
a
thing
or
two
about
it
It's
all
right.
-
So...
It
was
good
seeing
you.
Yeah.
You're
very
handsome.
And
no
man
in
this
town
And
you
have
my
pumpkin.
I...
I
have
to
go.
See
you.
It'll
all
be
perfect.
Daddy!
Daddy,
please
help
me!
I'm
lost!
Daddy,
please!
Please
help
me!
I'm
lost!
Daddy,
I'm
scared!
I
can
help
you,
little
boy.
Sweet
little
boy.
Please
help
me!
Daddy!
I'm
scared!
I'm
alone
in
the
woods!
Please
help...
You
move,
you
die.
Get
her
wand.
I
like
your
toys.
They
have
brought
They
need
to
interrogate
her.
Good
night,
Sheriff.
You
tell
us
what
we
want
being
the
most
painful
night
of
your
life.
-
The
children.
They
still
alive?
These
witches,
they
never
learn.
Let's
try
this
again.
Where
are
the
children?
Why
so
many?
Where
are
the
children?
The
blood
of
the
twelve
moons
The
blood
of
the
twelve
moons
will
soon
be
collected.
And
after
that,
only
one
object
remains.
Why
don't
you
just
burn
her?
We're
wasting
our
time.
She's
useless.
Twelve
moons.
Twelve...
Twelve,
twelve...
How
many
children
I
don't
know,
ten
or
eleven.
The
files.
We
need
to
count
them.
-
It's
eleven.
They
need
one
more
child.
Look,
-
Look
for
their
age...
...hair
colour,
genders,
something.
-
I've
got
five
girls.
You
need
another
girl?
"Twelve
moons,"
what
does
that
mean?
It's
a
month.
It's
a
month.
There's
no
April.
April
is
missing.
They
need
a
girl
born
in
April.
You
are
too
late.
-
Go!
Sheriff,
birth
records
of
Augsburg.
It
is
there.
filthy
bounty
hunters
like
yourself.
Come
on.
There
can't
be
that
many.
-
Anything?
Little
girl,
six
years
old,
born
April
8th.
-
She's
the
only
one
I
could
find.
This
girl,
do
you
know
her?
Yes,
I
know
her.
Mary
Behlmer.
Where
does
she
live?
Fire!
Fire!
Time
is
up.
Tell
me
where
she
lives.
Over
here!
Mama!
Stop!
Stop
right
there!
Oh,
no!
No,
no.
Oh,
no.
No,
Lucas!
Lucas.
No!
Damn
you!
Take
her
back!
To
the
well!
Over
here!
We
need
more
help!
Now
whatever
happens,
-
Follow
my
lead.
Okay?
Are
you
a
good
shot?
No.
Not
really.
That's
why
I
use
a
shotgun.
Gretel,
the
famous
witch
hunter.
Finally
we
meet.
Who
are
you?
I
see
you
got
my
invitation.
Say
your
name
I
go
by
many
names,
none
of
which
Oh,
my
God.
Help!
Help!
Please!
Hey!
Help!
Shit.
Don't
worry.
I'm
not
going
to
kill
you.
Not
now.
And
not
like
this.
You
have
something
I
need.
The
last
ingredient.
Humans
have
such
ghastly
taste.
I
think
this
place...
...could
use
a
bit
of
colour.
Shit!
-
Good
morning.
You
were
covered
in
filth,
so
I
was
just
cleaning.
What
happened?
Well,
the
witches
took
a
young
girl,
Well,
the
witches
took
a
young
girl,
and
a
lot
of
people
died
in
the
fires.
And
now
the
Sheriff,
for
what
happened
last
night.
Augsburg's
not
really
And
my
brother?
Last
time
I
saw
him,
on
her
broom,
flying
out
of
town.
Right.
Wow.
Where
did
you
get
all
this
stuff?
From
everywhere.
I
actually
plan
to
be
a
witch
hunter,
Like
you
guys.
This
isn't
the
life
we
chose,
Ben.
I
was
wondering
about
that
story
about
your
parents
leaving
you.
Is
all
that
true?
Yep.
Why?
I
don't
know.
That's
what
they
did.
I'm
sorry.
Do
you
want
some
porridge?
Sure.
Not
too
hot,
not
too
cold,
but
just
right.
So
last
night,
who
was
she,
I
don't
know.
She
looked
normal
-
I
thought
only
Grand...
Who
is
this?
She
lived
outside
of
town
She
was
accused
of
witchcraft,
We
just
burned
her
anyway.
You're
safe.
You'll
be
safe.
I
have
to
find
my
brother.
Hansel!
Hey!
Hansel!
Are
you
all
right?
Oh,
shit.
The
witch
hunting
is
going
well,
I
see.
Yeah.
Hey,
say,
can
you...
Can
you
tell
me
That
way.
That
way.
Okay.
Thank
you!
-
Thanks.
-
You
need
some
help?
I'm
fine.
Thank
you.
Okay.
I'll
see
you
later.
Mother...
Are
you
okay?
Hi.
Help
me.
Hansel!
Hansel!
Are
you
done
yet?
I've
got
to
get
to
my
sister.
This
may
take
a
while.
But
if
we
don't
clean
it,
Fever?
You've
really
taken
a
beating,
I
think
the
real
damage
which
I
left
somewhere
It's
probably
going
to
be
easier
Oh,
no,
no.
No,
I
can't.
The
water
is
healing.
Yeah,
I
don't
swim
well.
Then
I'll
go
in
with
you.
Oh,
okay.
Oh,
boy.
So,
it's
healing
waters,
did
you
say?
You
know,
the
last
time
I
came
across
She
mostly
looked
like
a
toad
but
she
could
breathe
underwater,
which
made
her
difficult
to
track.
She
was
deadly.
You
talk
too
much.
Hansel!
Hansel!
Come
here.
She's
a
wild
one,
eh?
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
You're
under
arrest
and
for
bringing
Listen,
you
idiot!
The
witches
are
I
need
to
find
my
brother
Shut
up.
This
time,
I
do
the
talking.
You
do
the
bleeding.
Bitch!
You're
making
this
too
easy.
You
want
some
more?
Huh?
What
the
hell?
No!
Following
this
road,
make
it
back
to
Augsburg
by
nightfall.
Yeah.
I
hope
so.
When
you
find
your
sister,
could
you
come
back
to
see
me
again?
Yes,
of
course.
Drink.
No.
Drink!
Why
did
you
save
me?
Trolls
serve
witches.
Hey,
wait.
Wait!
What's
your
name?
Edward.
Edward,
wait!
Where
am
I?
Hansel?
Gretel?
Where
have
you
been?
Where
have
you
been?
-
Hi.
Hey,
what
happened
to
your
face?
Gretel?
-
Who
did
this
to
you?
Who
did
this
to
you?
I'm
okay.
Honey,
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
You
okay?
I'm
okay.
Where
are
we?
I
don't
know.
You
okay?
Did
you
have
to
land
on
me?
What
is
this
place?
This
isn't
a
regular
witch's
lair.
No.
Let's
get
the
hell
out
of
here.
Hey,
sis?
I
think
you're
going
to
I
think
this
is
our
old
house.
And
this
is
our
old
room.
Here.
Look.
There's
your
bed.
Right?
Remember
this?
I
think
that's
you.
And
some
sort
of
vicious
badger.
Old
beds.
Hansel.
You
ever
wonder
We
don't
talk
about
that,
Gretel.
We
made
a
promise,
you
know
that.
Why
do
you
think
Leave
it
alone.
-
This
is
our
house.
This
is
where
we
grew
up!
And
what
does
that
look
like
to
you?
I
don't
know,
Gretel.
So
what?
So
we're
cursed?
No.
I
think
that
our
mother
was...
I
see
you
finally
found
your
way
How
very
sweet.
I
remember
this
house.
The
house
of
Adrianna,
the
Great
White
Witch.
Your
whore
of
a
mother.
Let
me
tell
you
a
little
story.
Once
upon
a
time,
there
was
a
farmer
who
fell
And
with
their
two
beautiful
children,
oh,
they
were
so
happy.
But
not
for
long.
During
a
Blood
Moon,
there
is
a
potion
that
will
make
you
immune
to
fire.
The
key
to
the
potion
is
the
heart
of
a
Grand
White
Witch.
But
your
mother,
was
too
strong
for
us.
So
it
had
to
be
you,
Gretel.
It
had
to
be
your
heart.
As
the
Blood
Moon
approached,
to
the
people
of
Augsburg.
And
when
she
knew
they
were
coming,
she
had
your
father
take
you
Father!
Wait!
Don't
let
her
get
away!
She
didn't
know
what
but
she
was
too
proud
to
run.
And
a
white
witch
would
never
use
her
When
your
father
came
back
for
her...
No!
...
they
hanged
him.
-
Run
him
up!
...
right
in
front
of
your
mother's
burning
flesh!
Adrianna
was
gone.
But
so
was
your
heart.
And
the
Blood
Moon
passed.
The
end.
It's
a
beautiful
story,
don't
you
think?
They
died
to
save
you.
And
all
your
life,
how
you've
hated
them.
Tomorrow
sisters
from
all
dark
corners
of
the
land
will
join
me
in
the
light
for
the
greatest
Sabbath
of
all.
The
only
thing
left
is
the
everlasting
power
of
the
heart
of
a
Grand
White
Witch.
You
know,
you
talk
too
much.
Bad
move,
witch
hunter.
Hansel!
Drink
it.
It
will
help
the
pain.
Mina?
What
did
you
do?
Mina?
You're
a
witch?
There
are
good
witches
in
the
world.
-
Not
many,
but
some.
I'm
a
witch,
but
I
won't
hurt
you.
I
checked
you.
You
were...
Yeah,
but
only
the
dark
witches
Dark
witches?
Think
about
it,
if
their
spells
don't
work
on
you,
I'm
not
like
them,
Hansel.
Gretel.
Shit.
-
Where
are
you
going?
Who
has
your
sister?
Witches
have
my
sister.
They...
-
Where?
about
a
ritual
or
a
gathering.
There's
a
place
deep
in
the
forest,
A
place
dark
witches
use
Where
is
it?
Hansel,
I...
Mina,
how
do
I
get
there?
If
there
is
a
Sabbath,
They'll
be
too
powerful.
I
don't
have
time
for
this.
No,
listen,
Hansel,
Something
very
powerful.
The
Abramelin
Grimoire!
It
exists!
This
is
the
book
I
can't
believe
this.
Don't
ask,
kid.
If
this
thing
does
what
it
says,
it
will
allow
us
Oh,
yeah?
Their
wands
won't
We
just
need
something
to
bless.
Okay,
let's
start
with
this.
I
hope
this
works.
You
ever
shoot
a
gun?
Well,
I
did
win
the
county
fair
three
times.
All
right.
In
that
case...
Don't
touch
the
gun.
Edward.
What
are
you
doing
here?
What's
going
on?
Muriel.
Edward,
I
need
your
help.
Please,
Edward.
Hey!
You
filthy
oaf!
Get
the
children.
We're
moving
out.
It's
time.
Okay,
are
we
good?
Yes.
Well,
as
far
as
you
go,
kid.
But,
I
will
leave
you
with
this.
-
Wow!
Shoot
anything
that
moves.
Good
luck.
Shut
up!
After
tonight,
no
sister
will
be
burned
on
their
pyres!
No
sister
will
be
ashes
on
the
ground!
I
want
your
brains!
And
now,
now
we
feast!
That's
a
lot
of
witches.
Okay.
I'm
going
to
go
down
Push
them
into
the
middle,
Now,
when
you
see
my
signal,
Wish
me
luck.
Yes.
The
hour
has
come!
The
Blood
Moon
arrives!
The
Grand
White
Witch
dies!
Listen
to
me
carefully!
If
you
let
my
sister
I'll
consider
not
killing
-
Finish
him.
Please
work.
We
have
to
hurry.
You
get
the
children.
Now,
move!
Walk!
Move
it!
Come
on!
Gretel!
Edward.
Gretel!
I'm
okay!
Go
get
the
children!
Stay
still!
Get
off
of
me!
No!
Thank
you!
-
Shit!
Gretel!
Well,
where
are
you
going?
I
have
to
help
Edward!
Edward.
Who
the
fuck's
Edward?
-
Hell,
yeah!
Hansel!
Hansel!
I
did
it!
I
shot
her!
Muriel.
-
Where?
Good
job.
She's
close.
Edward?
You
can't
be
serious.
Is
this...
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Wow.
Whatever
you
do,
Stop
right
there,
or
the
little
boy
dies.
I
thought
it
would
where
it
all
began.
Kind
of
lost
its
charm
a
little,
huh?
Drop
it.
Good
boy.
Don't
worry,
kid.
I'm
not
going
to
let
her
hurt
you.
Oh,
really?
Really.
The
end
is
near,
witch
hunter.
I
wish
I
could
say
would
be
a
lie.
Get
away
from
him.
Always
funny
seeing
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Not
bad.
Sacrificing
yourself
to
save
a
human.
Pathetic.
No!
Mina.
Hey.
Come
here.
Hansel.
Hansel.
I
tried
to
stop
her.
You
did.
You
did
good.
You
did
good.
You
got
to
be
fucking
kidding
me.
Oh,
please.
Please?
Please,
stop.
Please.
Yeah,
nice
try.
Finish
her
already.
Revenge
doesn't
change
the
past.
It
won't
bring
our
parents
back.
-
You
all
right?
Glad
to
hear
it.
But
it
sure
as
hell
feels
good.
My
sister
and
I
know
the
truth.
We
know
who
we
are
now.
And
so
do
they.
They
know
our
story,
our
powers,
what
we
can
do.
And
they
should
fear
us.
All
of
us.
We
should
be
getting
close
now.
And
so
after
this
next
one,
Three?
You
said
three
more
Come
on,
you
always
say,
Yeah,
but
you
ain't
getting
any
of
it.
Unless
you
want
to
pull
the
cart.
Right,
big
guy?
I
told
you
he'd
come
in
handy.
There
are
good
witches
in
the
world.
We
know
that
now.
But
for
the
ones
practicing
We're
coming
for
you.
No
matter
where
you
are,
we'll
find
you.
And
dead
or
alive,
we'll
take
you
down.
Edward,
want
to
knock?
My
vote:
Dead.
I
hate
to
break
it
to
you,
