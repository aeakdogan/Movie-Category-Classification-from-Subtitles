Is
there

Look
at

I
don't.
You
know,
Johnny,
it
takes
you
five
minutes.
5
minutes
to
put
the

on

wants
to

Well,
it's

look,
I

Hey,
I

Well,
there's

Do
you
remember
one

It
was
from

I
jumped
out
at
you
And
grandpa
got
all
excited,
and
"Boy,
you'll
be
damned
to
hell.
"
Remember
that?
Well,
you
used
Johnny.
-
Well,
you're
still
afraid.
They're
coming
to
get
you,
Barbra.
Stop
it.
You're
ignorant.
They're
coming
for
you,
Barbra.
Stop
it.
You're
acting
like
a
child.
They're
coming
for
you.
Look!
There
comes
one
of
them
now.

He'll
hear
you.
Johnny!
Johnny!
Help

gotta

We
have
to
get

we
better
take

I

happening?
Two

are
two
of

out

I
can
take

of

two.
-
I
know
you're
afraid,
but
we
have
to...
What's
happening?
They
know
we're
in
here
now.
Don't
look
at

Get
some

Why
don't
you
see
if
you
can
find
something
there
by
the
fireplace,
Well,
goddamn...
Look.
I
know
you're
afraid.
But
we
have
to

I'm
going

We'll
be

We'll
be

You'll
have
to

Now
I
want
you
to
go
in
and
get

Ok?
They're
not
that
strong.
Here,
I
want
you
to
pick
out
some
nails.
There,
this

pretty
secure.
If

we
can
run

They're
afraid
now.
They're
afraid
of
fire.
You
know
a
place
back
down
the
road
Anyhow,
that's
where
I
found
There's
a
radio
in
the
truck.
I
had
jumped
in
to
listen
to
it,
When
a
big
gasoline
truck
came
Well,
there
must
have
been
Grabbing
and
holding
on.
Now,
I
didn't
see
them
at
first.
I
could
just
see
that
the
truck
And
those
things
Truck
went
Slammed
on
my
brakes
to
keep
It
went
right
through
I
guess...
I
guess
the
driver
into
that
gas
station
It
went
right
through
the
billboard.
and
never
stopped
moving.
By
now
it's
like
a
moving
bonfire.
Didn't
know
if
the
truck
I
can
still
hear
the
man,
screaming.
This
thing
is
I
look
back
at
the
diner
to
see
If
there
was
anyone
there
That
was
when
I
noticed
that
The
entire
place
Wasn't
a
sign
of
life
left,
except...
by
now,
there
were
no
more
screams.
I
realized
that...
I
was
alone.
With
50
or
60
of
those
things.
Just
standing
there,
staring
at
me.
I
started
to
drive.
I...
Just
plowed
right
through
them.
They
didn't
move.
They
didn't
run,
or...
Just
wanted
to
crush
them.
They...
We
were
riding
in
the
cemetery.
Johnny
and
me.
Johnny.
We...
we
came
to
put
a
wreath
Johnny
and...
"Can
I
have
some
candy,
Barbra?"
And
we
didn't
have
any.
And...
Oh,
it's
hot
in
here.
Hot...
And
he
said,
"Oh,
it's
late.
"
"Why
did
we
start
so
late?"
And
I
said,
"Johnny,
"if
you'd
gotten
up
earlier,
"we
wouldn't
be
late.
"
Johnny
asked
me
if
I
were
afraid.
And
I
said,
"I'm
not
afraid,
Johnny.
"
And
then
this
man
He
came
slowly,
and
Johnny
"He's
coming
to
get
you,
Barbra.
"
And
I
laughed
at
him,
and
said,
And
then
Johnny
ran
away.
And
I
went
up
to
this
man,
and
I
was
going
to
apologize,
Why
don't
you
just
keep
calm?
And
I
looked
up,
And
he
grabbed
me!
He
grabbed
me!
He
held
me
and
he
ripped
I
think
you
should
just
calm
down.
Oh,
I
screamed,
And
he
wouldn't
let
me
go.
And
then
Johnny
came
and
he
ran
And
he...
he
fought
this
man,
And
I
got
so
afraid
I
ran.
I
ran...
I
ran...
And
Johnny
didn't
come.
We've
got...
Maybe...
we'd
better
go
out
We
have
to
go
out
and
get
Johnny.
He's
out
there.
Please,
don't
you
hear
me?
Please!
Please
help
me!
Look,
don't
you
know
what's
going
on
out
Don't
you
understand?
-
Your
brother
is
dead.

Why,
we'd
never

down
in

if

did

there'd
be

can

we
got

I'm
gonna

No,
I'm

wait

We
can
make
it

So
let's

yourself
in

up
here,
Yeah,

were.
Harry?
It's

I'm...
I'm
taking
the
girl
with
me.
Keep
your

Now
if
you're
going
down
The

insane.
We've...
we've
got

This
your
house?
You
going
down
there
with
him?
Yes
or
no?
This
is
your
last
chance.
Listen,
I
got
a
kid
down
there.
She
can't
possib...
She
can't
possibly
take
smashing
through
the
windows.
Well,
you're
her
father.
If
you're
stupid
enough
to
go
die
However,
I
am
not
stupid
enough
It
is
tough
for
the
kid
Now,
get
the
hell
down
You
can
be
the
boss
down
there.
You
bastards!
You
know,
I
won't
open

Mr.
Cooper,
with
your
help...
Let
him
go,
man.
Wait
a
minute.
Judy?
Come
on
up
here,
honey.
You're
gonna
let
them
It's
all
right,
honey.
If
we
stick
together,
man,
There's
lots
of
places
Mr.
Cooper?
if
all
three
of
us
were
working
together.
Hey.
He's
wrong,
you
know.
I'm
not
boxing
myself
in
Well,
we're
safe
now.
What
about
Tom
and
Judy?
They
wanna
stay
up
there.
There
are...
two
other
people
upstairs.
We
heard
the
screaming.
Yeah,
but
I
didn't
know
and
I
wasn't
about
to
take
Of
course
not,
Harry.

Is
she
all
right?
She
feels
warm.
Where'd
you
get
the
bandage?
Some
laundry
in
the
basket.
Let
them
stay
upstairs.
Let
them.
Too
many
ways
those
monsters
We'll
see
who's
right.
We'll
see,
when
they
come
begging
me
-
That's
important,
isn't
it?
To
be
right.
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
Does
anyone
up
there
Whatever
it
is,
It's
some
kind
of
mass
murder.

The
radio
said
to
stay
inside...
Radio,

There's
a
radio
upstairs

Nothing!
Nothing.

We
are
staying
down
here,

Harry,
that
radio
is
at
least
If
the
authorities
know
Well,
they'll
send
people
for
us,
How
are
we
going
to
know
if
we
lock
ourselves
in
this
dungeon?
We
may
not
enjoy
living
together...
But
dying
together
isn't
Those
people
Mr.
Cooper!
Mr.
Cooper?
They

Let's
go
up.
Tom?
Yes?
If
Judy
would
come
downstairs
Harry
and
I
Ok.
Yeah.
Right
away.
Will
you
do
it?
Do
I
have
to?
Look,
honey.
Nothing's
gonna
get
done

Do
this.
For
me.
Ok,
open
up.
I'll
take
good
care
of
her,
Helen.
She's
all
I

Why
don't

here.
Give
me
