is
that?
-We've

to
get
it
off

Do
you
want
something?
RlPLEY:
Yes,

That's
plenty.
ASH:
Please
don't
do
that.
RlPLEY:

sorry.
ASH:
Well,
it's
an
interesting
making
him
a

-No,that
l
didn'tforget.
Look,what
would
you
His
only
chance

RlPLEY:
Unfortunately,
you

everybody's
life.
Maybe

Maybe

a
risk
lt's
a
pretty
big

it's
safe
to
