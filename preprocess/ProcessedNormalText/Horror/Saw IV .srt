The

Why
don't
you
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
John's
life
defines
pretty
much
it......??????
So,
why
don't
we
start
at
the
end
and
I
represent
Mrs.
Tuck.
She
knows
something.
I
thought
you
were
going
home.
Take
it.
Finish
the
remodeling.
Spend
She
understands.
Then,
don't
take
it
for

months.

I
can
only
be
as
optimistic
as
the
facts
allow.
Yeah.
Well
I'm
in
it
until
I
find
him.
Finding
his
body's
not
going
to
vindicate

Finding

alive
will.
It's
time
to
let
go.
I
want
you
to
go
home.
I'll
call
you
later
to
make
sure
Who's
he?
Lieutenant
Rigg,
our
SWAT
commander.
What's
his
problem?
Everyone
around
him
keeps
dying.
What's

say?
It
says
I
tried
calling
you
four
times.
It
says

is
I
need
to
help
my
mum
for
a
few
No,
I
can't.
You

do
is

company
called
No
irony
in
that,
huh?
What
was
Rigg
watching?
Jill
Tuck's
interrogation.
It's
old.
Why's
a
SWAT
guy
watching
that?
What's
wrong?
I
really
think
we
should
tell
Hoffman
She
said
two
officers
might
be
in
danger
but
If
Detective
Hoffman
or
anyone
else
in
this
precinct
That's
your

Hello,
Officer
Rigg.
Welcome
to
your
rebirth.
For
years,
you
stood
by
and
witnessed
as
You
have
remained
untouched
while
But
with
your
survival
came
your
obsession.
Obsession
to
stop
those
around
you
from
Thus,
preventing
you
from
making
the
right
ones.
You
wanted
to
save
everyone.
Tonight,
I
give
you
the
opportunity
to
face
your
obsession.
Look
closely.
Eric
Matthews
is
still
alive.
The
block
of
ice
he
stands
upon
on
is
melting.
He
has
but
ninety
minutes
to
save
himself.
Detective
Hoffman's
fate
is
linked
to
that
???
Heed
my
warning,
Officer
Rigg.
Their
lives
hang
in
the
balance
of
your
obsession.
Will
you
learn
how
to
let
go
The
choice
is
yours.
Take
off
the
mask
and
put
your
hands
in
the
air.
I
can't
remove...
Officer
Rigg,
your
first
test.
The
person
in
front
But
it
is
not
your
job
to
save
them.
You
view
this
person
as
a
victim
but
Beneath
the
mask
lies
a
criminal
Your
obsession
tells
you
to
save
the
victim,
Are
you
a
cop?
What?
Are
you
a
cop?!
Yeah.
I'm
a
cop.
What
is
that?!!
What're
you
doing?!!!
Get

in
the
gears?

Fisk...
We

a
call.
A
shot's
fired
from
23
Park
Place.
That's
Rigg's
apartment.
Hello,
Brenda.
I
want
to
play
a
game.
An
officer
will
try
to
save
you.
If
he
is
successful,
then
your
game
begins.
This
man
will
use
these
photos
to
sentence
And
the
only
way
to
stop
him
is
Let
him
save
your
life
and
accept
...or
kill
him
and
guarantee
your
freedom.
Make
your
choice.
I'll
fucking
kill
you,
you
fucking
bitch!
It's
started.

for
Rigg.
Everybody's
looking.
He
has
a
wife.
Where
is
she?
We
haven't
located
her
yet.
Strahm...
Two
detectives.
You
see
these?

Hoffman.....????..

Hoffman...
How
do
you
explain
Detective
Matthews?
He's
alive.
Six
months,
Jigsaw
never
kept
anyone
that
long.
No
one
but
Amanda
Young.
You
think
he's
been
fixed.
Why
these
six?
Hoffman's
a
?????
lieutenant.
He
That's
what
you
see.
But
Rigg
tried
to
save
his
two
friends.
Maybe.
We
got
names
and
locations
Working
it.
This
is
overkill.
It's
a
setup
to
Or
a
setup
for
his
alibi.
Everyone
around
him
keeps
dying
but
...or
what
the
hell
these
photos
Look
there.
Lamp????
please.
Four
walls
build
a
home.
What
does
he
want
us
to
see
on
these
walls?
The
victims?
One
of
these
pictures
doesn't
belong.
This
is
who
we're
looking
for.
Lets
talk
to
her
now.
Jill
Tuck,
where
is
she?
Have
them
turn
off
the
air
in
there.
Ms.
Tuck.
I'm
Special
Agent
Perez.
This
I'd
like
to
apologize
for
pulling

What
more

interrogation
tapes...
...and
the
volumes
of
evidence
taken
Actually,
it's
not
John

wanna
talk
Me?
Why'd
you
wanna
talk
about
me?
So
stop
wasting
both
of
our
time
and
get
to
A
little
help...
Hey!
You
hear
me?!
You

I
help
you?
Hello,
Officer
Rigg.
In
order
for
you
to

I

you
is
of
a
man
in
In
the
next
room
are
the
tools
to
his
salvation.
His
life
is
in
your
hands.
But
in
the
end,
only
he
can
save
himself.
Be
careful.
There
are
camera's
watching.
And
you
must
hide
your
identity.
Make
your
choice.
Ok.
Four
walls
build
a
home.

Care
to
shed
any
light
on
that?
On
what
your
photos

life?
Cherish
your
life
is
the
concept
that

life.
That's
his
motto.
No.
It's
your
motto.
The
clinic

I've
been
here
for

Shut

Hey

You
don't
wanna
do
that.
What
the
fuck's
your
problem?
You're
my
problem.
And
you're
becoming
everybody
else's
too.
How
do
you
feel?
About
a
husband
who
takes
a
motto
from
your
...and
twist
it
into
some
manic
torture
mantra.
That
part
of
John
has
nothing
to
do
with
me.
Look,
Ms.
Tuck.
I
just
left
a
room
with
more
blood
on
the
walls
...and
there's
a
growing
pile
of
bodies
in
their
wake
-
...hall
of
fame
psychopath
husband...
...points
to
you
as
a
possible
accomplice.
You
know
there's
a
lot
of
people
out
Want
to
place
blame
on
someone.
But
you
know
what
the
best
part
is.
I
don't
have
to
convince
everybody.
Ok,
tell
me
about
his
workshop.
Stay
there.
-
Wow,
it's
big.
This
is
exactly
what
you've
been
looking
for.
Nice,
huh?
Tada.
This
is
the
clock?
What's
so
special
about
it?
Except
for
the
fact
the
whole
deal
hung
out.
The
mechanism
inside
is
300
years
old.
It's
still
ticking.
It
stood
the
test
of
time.
Well,
you
see
this
space.
I
got
a
surprise
for
you.
Why
are
you
doing
this?
Why?
This
is
a
mistake
and
it
happened
And
I...
I
paid
for
this.
Just
let
me
go,
okay?
What's
behind
the
door?
One
saves
lives.
One
takes
it
away.
Try

door.
Terrific.
Oh

about
Eric
Matthews?!
I
don't

who
that
is.
Do
you
know
what
this
is?
I
don't
know.
What
are
you
gonna
do
to
me?
If
you
are

step
closer
As
an
officer
of
the
law,
you
find
yourself
torn
????
You
sick
fuck.
His
salvation
is
out
of
your
hands.
It
is
your
choice
if
you
wish
to
put
it
into
his
own.
Once
this
lesson
is
learnt,
you
will
find
yourself
one
Without
you,
this
man's
game
cannot
begin.
And

the
decision.

Okay.
People

Jigsaw
mantra?
This
wasn't
about
Ivan.
It
wasn't
his
test.
This

Enraged.
Exactly.

Jigsaw
wanted
Rigg
to
see
what
he
sees.
He
wants
him
to
feel
what
he
feels.
This
wasn't
about
Rigg
saving
his
friends.
He's
being
recruited.
Thanks.

Hello,
Officer
Rigg.
What
have
you

teacher.

lesson.
If

then
you
will

So
I
ask
you
Officer
Rigg.
Has
the
pupil
learnt
her
lesson?
Has
she

told

her
ways?
Does

place.

What

Jill?
John
gave
me
that.
What?
Hey,
you
alright?
You're
not
returning
my
calls,
buddy.
Listen,
John.
I'm
sorry.
I
understand
that
what
happen
was
a
tragedy?
But
I
gotta
tell
you.
Listen,
John.
I
gotta
tell
you.
You
know
those
buildings
we're
working
on.
You
take
and
give
my
share
to
Jill.
That's
not
the

it
works,
John.

families

in.
40
families,
John.
From
low-income
families.
You
can't
just
walk
away.
You're
their
saviour,
John.
Get
the
fuck
out
of
here.
Who
are
you
talking
to
like
that?
That's
me.
John.
Do
you
even
listen?
Oh,
I
heard
you
John.
Get
the
fuck...
You
heard
me.
Ok,
John.
You
take
good
care
of
yourself.
You
call
me
when
your
feeling
well.
He
blamed
me.
I
don't
think
he
could
ever
forgive
me.
His
minor
time
was
over.
He
was
diagnosed
with
cancer
soon
after
that.
Did
you
try
to
contact
him
again?
I
tried.
But
a
different
person
crawled
Someone
else
survived.
I
asked
you
not
to
come
here.
I
just
wanna
talk
to
you.
John.
John.
Look
at
this.
What
is
this?
Why
do
you
have
this
old
picture?
What
have
you
done
to
him?
I
told
him
not
to
take
life
for
granted.
I
want
to
play
a
game.
Your
life
is
a
lie.
Now,
comes

of
truth.

a
drug
user
and
a
hustler,
you've

Would
you
give
me
time
to

you,
Cecil.

has
ruined

Please,
just
let
me
go.
I
could
let
you
go.
But
that
wouldn't
serve
you.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
will
do,
though.
I'll
give
you
a
tool
to
reclaim
your
life.
And
to
discard
the
vices
that
I
don't

Maybe,
you
will

Cecil.
You
see
things
aren't
sequential.
Good
doesn't
lead
to
good

bad.

Others
lie
and
cheat.
And
get
elected.

people
stop

There's
no
accounting
for
it.
How
you
play

cards
you're
dealt.
That's
all
that
matters.
Look
at
me.
Do
you
understand
what
I'm
saying
to
you?
No.
Yeah,
I
understand.
You're
fucking
nuts.
Woah!
What
the
fuck
is
that?
It's

tool
that's
gonna
save
