-
Hello?
-
Uh,
yes?
-
Who
are
you
calling?

Wrong
number.
-
Who
was
that?
-
Did
you
pick
a
movie?
-
"Saw
4."
It
sucks.
I
hate
all
that
torture-porn
shit.

Well,
I
like
Jigsaw.
But
you
don't
give
a
shit
who
dies
There's
just
body
parts
ripping
-
Who
do
you
keep
texting?
-
He
keeps
leaving
me
messages.
Just
stuff.
Like,
"Hey,
what's
up?
So
delete
him.
I
did,
So
report
him.
He's
really
hot,
though.
That's
Channing
Tatum.
It
is
not.
Yeah,
from
his
Abercrombie
days.

-
Hello?
The
more
impatient
version
I'm
sorry.
No,
of
course
I
don't.
You
hang
up
on
me
and
I'll
cut
through
-
Who
is
it?
-
Hello?
It's
Trudie.
This
is
the
last
person
It's
a
prank.
Hang
up.

You're
the
one
with
the
stalker.
Don't
freak
out.

Let
it
ring.


It's
from
stalker
boy.
He
said,
"Answer
the
phone."

For
God's
sake.
It's
probably
Lexi
or
Karen.
To
make
sure

No.
Don't
open
it.
You're
overreacting.
It's
a
joke,
Trudie,
okay?
-
They're
just
trying
to
scare
you.

Who
is
it?
I
said,
who
is
it?
Let's
call
the
cops.

"I
dare
you
to
open
the
door."
No,
Sherrie.
Don't.
No,
don't,
I'm
scared.
Hey,
Lisa,
Bailey,
Wayne,
or
the
hopeful
long
shot,
-
There's
nobody
out
here.

What
does
it
say?
It
says,
"I'm
not
outside.

Trudie!
Trudie...
oh,
my
God.



Fucking
kidding
me?
What?
That
was
so
fucking
stupid.
The
death
of
horror
I
jumped.
A
fucking
Facebook
killer?
I
guess
now
it
would
be
Twitter.
A
bunch
of
articulate
teens
sit
around
until
Ghostface
kills
them
one
by
one?
It's
been
done
to
death,
the
whole
self-aware,
Stick
a
fork
in
1996
already.
I
like
the
"Stab"
movies.
It's
not
aliens
or
zombies
There's
something
real
about
a
guy
snaps.
It
could
really
happen.
I
can't
do
it.
They
just
keep
recycling
Even
the
opening
scene.
There's
always
some
random
girl
that
undoubtedly
ends
up
It's
all
so
predictable.
You
can
see
everything
coming!
Aah!

-

It's
your
own
fault.
Why?
-
Because
you
talk
too
much.
Now
shut
the
fuck
up


Oh,
my
God,
I
love
it.
I've
seen
it
five
times,
You're
kidding.

Okay.
"Twilight
Zone"?
I
get
that.
It
begs
the
question
that
if
the
then
is
the
beginning
And,
if
so,
-
You're
over-thinking
it.
Or
did
whoever
make
it
There's
a
reason
I
can't
believe
you
haven't
seen
them.
That
has
nothing
to
do
I...
I
thought
you
said
"Stab"
The
first
three,
the
original
trilogy,
but
then
she
threatened
to
sue
them
so
then
they
just
started
making
"Stab
5"
has
time
travel,
Don't
we
hear
enough
At
least
Woodsboro's
known

Uh...
no,
I
didn't
hear
anything.
I
did.
Jenny?
-
Don't
try
to
scare
me.
-
You
do
it
all
the
time.
-
Where
are
you
going?
-
I
know
you're
trying
to
scare
me.

What
is
it?
I
must
have
left
a
window

Could
you
get
that?
-
Marnie?


-
Hello?
Marnie.
This
is
the
last
person
-
What?

I'm
sorry.
I
had
to.

You
bitch.
So
not
funny.
Somebody
falls
for
it
I
don't
see
why
you
get
off
on
this
sh...




Marnie?
Good
one,
Marnie.
You
know,
Wherever
you
are.

Let
me
guess.
You
want
me
to
walk
by
an
open
doorframe


Okay,
timing,
But
you
don't
have
the
app
so
you
can't
talk
like
Ghostface,

Yes
I
can.
-
Who
is
this?
Is
this
Trevor?
Do
I
sound
like
a
Trevor
to
you?
You're
in
my
movie.
-
What
movie?
Only
her
part
got
cut
way
back.
But
you,
you're
the
dumb
blonde
We'll
have
some
fun
with
you
I
have
a
4.0
GPA
and
135
IQ,
asshole.
-
She's
on
the
cutting
room
floor.
This
isn't
a
comedy.
People
live,
people
die.


Marnie?











(woman
screams,
Working
for
another
hour
tonight
Staring
at
the
wall
You
might
think
you
know
me,
Trying
to
ignore
When
something's
right
Then
something
is
worth
to
die
for
When
I
feel
Then
something
Don't
say
goodbye
Just
leave
an

I
wanna
hear
you

You
give
me
What
do
you
think?
Well,
-

Kids.
Oh.

It's
good.
Told

I'd

Nice.

approaching,
Ho!
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Shit.
Kirby.

Whoo.

Hey,
before
you
get
in
the
car,
Why?
What
did
you
do?
-
Trevor
called
me
last
night.
Because
you
won't
take
his
calls.
He
knows
I
have
your
ear,
-
Know
what?
Can
we
just
not
talk
about
this
now,

Fine.
Fine.
Okay,
He
called
you,
too?
He's
worried
your
cousin
distracting
you
from
knowing
-
Well,
that's
inventive.

Problem
with
Trevor
By
the
way,
have
you
seen
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
Sidney.
First
stop
on
her
road
to
a
new
life.
She's
the
reason
I'm
sure
she'd
love
to
hear
that.
Wherever
she
went,
people
died.
I
mean,
"Stab"
It
should
be
"Final
Destination."
Okay,
-
Ooh,
the
other
woman.
-

Hello,
Jill.
Shh!
Jenny?
-
What's
your
favorite
scary
movie?
What
does
she
want?


I
asked
you
a
question.
I'm
hanging
up.

Wow.

I
got
a
call
like
that
this
morning
What?
Watch
out!

Nice
move,
asshole!

You
just
ran
a
stop
sign.
Sorry.
-



The
mayor
wants
these
down

Only
twenty-five
more
to
go.
-
Morning,
Sheriff.
-
Joe.
Looks
like
the
celebration's
begun.
-
High
school
kids,
probably.
One
generation's
tragedy
Sorry
you
can
never
get
away
You
know,
I
wish
I'd
been
old
enough
when
you
were
solving
those
crimes.
Why's
that?
It's
those
intense
investigations
Well,
yeah.
How
is
Gale,
by
the
way?
Gale's
good.
Fiction.
Hey,
I
made
some
lemon
squares.
Uh,
thanks,
Deputy,
Sheriff,
you're
not
cheatin'
on
your
Yeah,
but
I
would
be
cheatin'

This
is
Sheriff
Riley.
You
gotta
get
over
It's
bad,
Sheriff,
real
bad.

The
book
is
"Out
of
Darkness,"
and
its
author,
Sidney
Prescott,
Have
the
seven
"Stab"
movies,
about
you,
I
don't
blame
Gale.
If
I
was
a
victim
for
too
long,
-
That's
why
I
wrote
this
book.
And
rave
reviews
for
her
book
All
right,
Gale,
let's
do
it.
Let's
reinvent
myself.

Except...
"I
have...
no
fucking
idea...

Oh,
is
that
new?
That's
the
2.0

version.
Nice.
Look.
Oh,
this
is

with
the
luscious
Olivia

Here

my
Woodsboro
Massacre
What
is
your
favorite
Is
that
all
you've
got?
Yeah,
It's
a
line
from
"Stab
One,"
duh.
You're
a,
a
genre
nut,
Kirby.
"Bambi."
Dork.
What?
That's
funny,
Kirby.

-
Completely
unaware
you
exist.

Yeah,
I
wish,
right?
I
think
Charlie
likes
you.
And
I
like
him.
To
tease,
to
torment,
You
could
do
a
lot
worse,
-

Hi,
Trevor.
Can
we
talk?
Somebody
cares
about
you
over
here,
Someone
who
made
you
Someone
who
never
When
you're
done
with
a
phone
call,
Or
when
you
take
someone
to
the
airport,
When
you
tell
someone
you
love
her,
and
then
you
just
go
out
that
is
not
letting
her
go,
That's...
that's
betrayal.

Trevor
Sheldon,
denied
live
on
"Hall
Pass"
What
is
your
favorite
scary
movie,
I'll
show
you.


And
I
began
to
believe
myself
a
victim,
So,
I
sat
down...
and
began
to
write
a
role
for
a
woman
who
could
leave
and
step
out
into
the
sunlight,

Okay,
we're
gonna
start
So
buy
your
copies
while
they
last.
New
York
Times
bestseller.
Gale.
Congratulations,
Sidney.
I
haven't
had
a
chance
I
know
where
you
can
get
one.
Dewey!
Hey!
Hey,
Sid.

Sid,
I'm
sorry,
-
Shit!
Excuse
me!
I
need
you
all
to
stay
where
you
are
Nobody
leaves
yet.
Can
this
wait,
Barney
Fife?
-
Ma'am,
this
is
a
police
event
now.
Gale,
this
is
police
business.
I'm
talking
to
my
husband,
Listen,
there's
a
phone
we
believe
may
have
been
taken
Deputy
Hicks
has
traced
its
location
The
rest
is
need-to-know.
-
And
I'm
not
"need-to-know"?

Sheriff,
it's
ringing
out
here!

There!
-
It's
coming
from
the
trunk.
Dewey?
-
Not
now,
Sid.

Okay,
Let's
lock
it
down.
-
Everybody
back.
Please
tell
me
this
is
a
prank,
-
I'm
afraid
not,
Sid.
-
Come
on.
Henry,
you're
not
gonna
believe
Stand
back,
Gale.
Gale.
I
just
wanna
see.

Cover
up
your
kid's
eyes!
Okay,
"Why
Woodsboro
is
the
best..."
Anything
with
an
on/off
switch
Somebody
wanna
share?
Jenny
Randall
and
Marnie
Cooper

What?
Stabbed
to
death.
-
What's
your
favorite
scary...
-
Yo,
it's
a
news
van!
That
was
fast.
This
week
marks
the
anniversary
Two
girls
killed
the
exact
day
chose
to
return
to
her
hometown.
It
all
could
be
something
right
out
And
where
is
she
now?
Well,
living
right
here
in
Woodsboro...
-
Mrs.
Riley.
-
First
Lady.
Excuse
me,
Gale.
Great.
You'll
have
to
wait,
Gale.

What
are
you
gonna
do,
If
it
comes
to
it.
Civilian
interference
poses
many
a
problem
Okay,
listen
to
me,
Judy.
I
don't
mind
that
you're
working
or
that
you
even
bake
him
But
if
you're
gonna
start
you
ought
to
put
a
moustache
on
-
Gale!
-
Gale!


Please.
Uh,
Sidney,
-
Sid.
Dewey,
would
you
please
explain
that
I
have
every
right
to
be
here?
If
there's
been
another
murder

-
It
is
all
over
the
Internet,
Dewey!
Yes!
The
whole
world
knows
She
wants
to
be
a
part

Hang
on.
Um,
are
you
familiar
with
the
phrase,
Gale,
with
all
due
respect,
Because
I
wrote
the
book
on
this!
"The
Woodsboro
Murders"
But
you're
not
a
reporter
anymore,
-
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Don't
treat
me
like
I'm
the
media.
I
helped
solve
these
things
three
times,
You
and
me.

Right?
What,
you're
not
gonna
let
me
I
can't.
All
right,
This
is
what
I'm
good
at,
This
is
what
I
know
how
to
do.

Your
lemon
squares
taste
like
ass.
They
don't.
Thank
you,
sir.
-
Sheriff.
We've
got
a
couple
Two
of
'em,
they
say
they
got
from
the
victims'
phones.
Names
are
Olivia
Morris
That's
Sid's
cousin.
Right
in
here,
Sheriff.
-
Hey,
Jill.
-
Hi.
It's
nice
to
see
you

-
Yeah.
Yeah,
us
two.
It
was
the
killer's
voice.
Or,
I
mean,
you
know,
I'm
Kirby,
by
the
way.
And
the
killer
didn't
call
you?
No.
Does
that
mean
that
I'm
not
gonna

No.
Maybe.
Of
course
not.
Oh,
my
God,
did
you
hear
that?
Dewey,
I
shouldn't
be
here.
I'm
afraid
that's
not
really
possible,
Look,
nobody
thinks
you're
involved,
And
there
was
evidence
in
your
car,
You
may
be
a
material
witness.

So,
look,
you'll
have,
uh,
That's
comforting.

Oh,
my
fucking
God,
Henry!
Two
girls
butchered.
I
was
so
not
feeling
Woodsboro.
Well,
fuck
me
wow.
Henry,
I'll
call
you
back.
Excuse
me
I
have
to
geek
out.
I
didn't
get
a
chance
but
it's
such
an
honor
to
meet
you.
-
Thank
you.
Hi.
When
I
was
a
kid,
it
was
all
about
-

You
were
my
'90s.
You
gave
it
all
up
for
love,
How
long
have
you
-
Ten
years.
Just
like
your
characters
Wow.
Oh,
I
didn't
mean
bad
wow.
It
just,
it
always
seemed
like
more
because
it
was
a
movie
and
in
real
life
Ooh,
dug
a
hole.
So
anyway
kudos
on
being
brave
enough
Any
plans
on
revitalizing
Listen,
in
about
two
seconds,
I'm
gonna
revitalize
your
face
Ooh...
I
still
got
it.
Testy.
She's
so
pretty.
When
you
think
about
what
she
survived,
Shh!
Her
mom
was
my
sister.
No
one
ever
asks
me
-
I'm
sorry,
Mrs.
Roberts.
Oh.
Well...
fine.
How
are
you?
How's
Gale?
Uh,
I'm
all
right.
But
Gale,
it's
been
hard
on
her.
Small
town...

You
two
okay?
Well,
I
read
somewhere
once,
"Just
when
you
think
things
can't
"sometimes
they
don't.

"Out
of
Darkness"
by
Sidney
Prescott,

Gotta
get
going.
It's
nice
to
see
you,
Dewey.
And
we'll
get
through
this,
too.
-
Lock
up.

-

It's
okay.
It's
just
me.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
No
match
for
the
ninja,
baby.

Anyway,
what
are
you
doing
in
the
house
I
mean,
that's
like
being
on
"Top
Chef"
Can
you
please
get
away
Y...
You
have
no
right
to
be
in
here.
Hang
on.
I
heard
you
got
a
phone
call
-
Is
that
true?
Don't
you
think
you'd
be
I
don't
trust
you
Trevor.
Hey.
Then
I'm
just
gonna
have

Oh,
sorry,
I
didn't...
No,
he's
just
leaving.
Oh.
Yeah.
-
Hi.
It's
cool
to
meet
you...
officially.
I
keep
meaning
to
pick
up
a
copy
-
You're
smaller
in
person.

What?
Nothing.
You
just,
uh...
-

Yeah.
Good
night.
'Night.
-

Just
makin'
my
rounds
Great.
Thanks.
Y...
You
don't
remember
me,
Sorry?
We
went
to
high
school
together.
We
had
the
same
homeroom
We
were
in
"Peter
Pan"
together.
You
were...
Tiger
Lily.
I'm
sorry,
It's
okay.
You
had
a
lot
of
stuff
goin'
Well,
it's
nice
to
see
you
again,
You
too.

You're
supposed
to
be
out

What's
a
4-letter
word
Uh...
"guts."
That's
Olivia
Morris.
She's
on
the
list.
She
can
live
next
door
to
me.
Now,
seriously,
uh...
I'm
warning
you,
okay,
-
I
mean
it.
This
is
it!
Just
fuck
off!



Hello?
What
are
you
guys
up
to?
Oh,
You
know
there
are

Yup.
They're

No,
she's
in
the

Forget
it.

Your

It's

around
here
tonight.
Well,
the
zombies
So
you
should
be
all
right.
-
Call
me
tomorrow,
okay?
-
She
didn't
wanna
come
up?
Watch
this.




What's
That's
the
worst
imitation
Speaking
of
"Stab,"
you
heard

My
mom
doesn't
let
me
go.

-
I'll
handle
this.
-
What
do
you
want?
Uh,
no,
it's
Kirby.
Jill
is
screening
her
calls
What's
going
on
over
there?
Hang
on
a
sec.

I'm
not
Trevor.
Wh...
what?
This
isn't
Trevor.
Oh,
a...
all
right.
Well,
then,
why
do
you
have
his
phone,


He's
being
weird.
I
wanna
talk
to
Jill.
Okay,
well,
Come
on,
Mr.
Ghostface,
Aren't
you
supposed
All
right.
What
movie?
"Shaun
of
the
Dead."
How
did
you
know
that?
Because
I'm
standing
Stop.
You
are
not.
-
What's
going
on?
-
I
mean,
if
it
is
him,
I
don't
know.
This
is
not
fucking
Trevor!
Well
then,
Open
the
closet
door.
You
do
know
there
are
cops
I
think
I'd
have
just
enough
time
-
I-I'll
talk
to
him.
What's
going
on
over
there,
S...
Sorry.
-
Shh.
Come
on,
do
it.
There
is
no
way
you're
in
there.
See
for
yourself.
Kirby?
Kirby,
come
on.
Talk
to
me.
Kirby!

Liar.
I'm
over
this.
I
never
said
I
was
in
your
closet.
-

-

Aaagh!

No!
Help!


-
Hoss!
-
Perkins!
Shit!
Help!
Help!







Welcome
home,
Sidney.
Why
don't
you
come
for
me?
Oh,
poor
Sidney.
-
You
think
you're
still
the
star.
-
It
will
be.

Spare
me
the
lecture.
You've
done
very
well
Well,
how
about
I've
got
plans
for
you.
I'm
gonna
slit
your
eyelids
in
half
when
I
stab
you
in
the
face.
You'll
die
when
I
want
you
to,
Sidney.
Until
then...

-
Sidney?!
-
Stay
right
there!
Do
not
look.
Okay?
She
said
-
Look
out!

-
What's
going
on
in
here?
Where
is
he?
-
He
was.
-
Jill?
-
What
happened?
Oh,
my
God,
Jill.
Jesus!
I'm
here.
Come
on.
Jill?
Oh,
my
God.
-
Here,
keep
pressure
on
it.
-
Hoss,
call
it
in.
Hey.
You
should
look
upstairs.


Let's
get
the
coroner's
van


It's
all
your
fault,
Sidney!

You're
just
like
your
mother!
-
Hoss,
clear
these
people
out.
-

I
thought
this
was
over!
I'm
sorry
about
what
I
said.
Do
you
wanna
go
get
that
looked
at?
Yeah.
What
the
hell
happened?
Okay.
I
saw
him
go
into
that
yard
Yeah,
and
I
circled
around
And?
And
I
met
Hoss
coming
He
must've
circled
back
around
somehow.
-
Chief,
we're
sorry.

All
right.

This
is
"Hall
Pass"
with
Robbie
Mercer,
What
began
as
a
day
of
remembrance
Olivia
Morris,
who
officially
So
is
Jenny
Randall
Our
local
legacy,
the
"Stab"
movies,
Excuse
me.
Live
video-blog
upload.
Oh.
Mind
turning
it
off
Can't.
Turn
that
fucking
thing
off.
Okay.
So,
you
two
are
the
boys
that
run
Charlie
runs
it.
It's
called
Cinema
Club.
So
you
must
have
a
very
unique
insight
Maybe.
What
if
we
could
catch
the
killer
Two
generations
intertwining
our
passions
for
media?
What
would
you
say?
I
love
you.
Very
good.
Now
you
give
me
your
expertise
and
maybe
Say,
a
celebrity
visit
By
me.
What
about
Sidney?
Yeah,
you
know
her,
right?
No
offense,
but
that'd
be
a
big
deal
A
visit
from
Sidney
Prescott?

Yes,
she's
Well,
without
the
book
sales
Whatever.
There's
no
broken
bones.
I
think
you'll
be
fine.
You
were
lucky,
Sidney.
So,
Sidney,
ooh,
ow.

Random
wants
to
lock
you
in
See
the
blank
line
in
your
contract?
And
as
soon
as
you're
clear
we're
on
the
next
plane
to
New
York.
I
booked
"Today,"
"The
View,"
Excuse
me.
-
Mm?
Thought
I'd
wait
for
the
movie.
Book
tour's
over.
Sidney.
Accept
your
situation.
You're
a
victim.
So
embrace
it,
use
it.
I
know
All
those
little
downtrodden
fucks
at
the
end
of
their
tunnel
And
a
lucky
break
like
this?
I'm
talkin'
100%
increase
in
sales,
That's
maybe
a
million
more
people
and
you
get
a
ton
more
checks,

-
Sidney.
-
Fired?
Fine.



"Have
you
even
read
my
book,



The
problem
with
Sidney
Or
even
a
little
shit-faced
She'll
call
me
tonight
and
apologize.

She'll
come
around.
Gotta
just
give
her
time,
Where
did
I?

Ah.


Sidney
Prescott,
please.
I'm
handling
Miss
Prescott's
calls
-
May
I
take
a
message?
-
Are
you
writing
this
down?
It's
kind
of
hard
to
hear
you.
If
you
could
just
hang
on
one
second.

I've
got
time.

it
doesn't
sound
to
me
Sounds
like
you're
in
a
parking
garage.
A
dark
But
if
you
want
to
be
in
the
hospital,
In
the
fucking
morgue!


No.



Help!
Help!
Help
me!
Help!
Cut
and
run,



This
is
an
ongoing
investigation.
Rest
assured,
The
less
I
say
about
that,
-
So
I'm
taking
questions.
-
Dewey!
Any
comment
on
the
fact
seem
to
resemble
the
pattern
Hon?

Later.

What
was
that,
Sheriff?
As
I
was
saying,
uh,
and
we
just
want
the
community
to
bringing
this
whole
situation
-



Oh,
shit!
Someone,
get
up
to
the
top
-
Everyone
back!
Stay
back!
Listen,
-
You
see
anybody?
There's
nobody
up
there,
It's
all
under
control,
What
am
I
supposed
to
say?
Listen,
but
I
happen
to
have
a
lead,
So
let
me
know
when
you're
back
Move
it,
amateurs!

And
remember,
students,
tonight's
town
curfew
is
9:00.
You
should
be
home
with
your
doors
Okay,
Cinema
Club.
Welcome.
We
are
a
sanctioned
one
rung
below
the
Glee
Club,
And

let
me
just
say
it's
an
honor.

Beyond
Jamie
Lee
Curtis,
I
mean,
this
is
the
ultimate.
Thanks.
I
guess.
Um
this,
high
school
experience
and,
Everybody'll
be
doing
it
someday,
Sid.
It's
kind
of
the
one
component
Wait.
Well,
if
you
wanna
be
the
killer
It's
like
the
natural
next
step
I
mean,
you
film
'em
all
real-time,
-
you
upload
'em
into
cyberspace.
-
Not
to
implicate
him.
So
who
do
you
think

Working
on
less
of
a
shriekquel
and...
-
Copyrighted
terms,
by
the
way.
Only
horror
the
studios
green-light.
-
Psst.
But
the
rules
have
changed.
Yeah,
you
gotta
have
an
opening
sequence
dial
up
some
flashy
and
the
kills
gotta
be
Modern
audiences
get
savvy
So
the
reversals
In
fact,
the
only
surefire
way
You
pretty
much
have
to
be
gay.
So
why
are
you
so
sure
that
the
killer's
Well,
the
original
"Stab"
structure
Yeah,
two
kids
killed
in
a
house
And
then
the
school's
hot
chick
-
We
all
know
where
it
goes
from
there.
Exactly.
A
party.
Guaranteed
third-act
Fingers
crossed

Okay,
so
do
you
know
of
a
party
Well,
there's
Stab-a-Thon.
Stab-a-Thon?
Uh,
it's
a
movie
marathon.
-
We
do
it
every
year.

There's
a
killer
out
there
patterning
his
murders
I
know.
-
Well,
you
have
to
call
it
off.
I'm
sure
we're
not
the
only
party
Where
is
this
circle
jerk
-
So
who's
ready
for
this
Q
and
A?
You
know,
Email
invites,
pretty
secret.

Really?
We're
working
together.

-
Fuck
you.




You
know
when
people
say,
but
you
know
they're
just
saying
that
no
frigging
idea
how
you
feel?
I
know
how
you
feel.
I...
am
so
sorry
about
Olivia.
I'm
sorry
about
your
publicist.
How
do
you
handle
it?
People
stare
at
me?

I
could
never
handle
I
just...
feel
like
it
would
take
over
Uh...
what
I
do
is
I...
try
not
to
think
about
me.
I
have
people
I
care
about.
And
the
rest,
it,
um,
You
saved
my
life
last
night.
I
mean,
I
know
we're
family,
Makes
me
wonder,
you
know,
if
I'd
have
been
brave
enough
I
really
hope
Well,
if
you
need
me,
I'll
be
up
in
my
cell.
Her
room's
all
boarded
up.

It's
really
weird.

I
think
Olivia
She'd
want
me
to
be
Holy
shit.
Even
if
I
did
just
crash-land
Speaking
of
which,
Hey,
Kirby.
What
is
he
doing
there?
I
have
no
idea.
Yeah,
fat
chance.
I
mean,
my
mom
-
It's
not
pretty.
You
go
do
your
"good
girl"
thing,
-
I
will
keep
you
posted.
(rock
music
playing,

Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon!

Thank
you!
Thank
you!
Shh.
Cinema

thanks
you
for
coming

and
oh,
my
God,
there's
a

Who's

No!
So
let's
get

Down

Screw
you!

Yes.
(thunder
crashes,
Oh,
yeah.

Perfect.
New
work-in-progress,
When
I
moved
to
Woodsboro,
that
I
would
again
play
in
solving
another
series
of
these...
What?
What
the
hell?

Gale,
where
are
you?
I
followed
the
kids
There's
an
old
abandoned
farm
Listen,
I've
got
it
and
I...
I
think
the
killer's
What
makes
you
so
sure?
You
do
a
remake
that's
what
the
kids
said.
This
party
Come
on!
How
"what-a"
can
you
get?
I
don't
know.
Dewey,
listen
to
me,
Come
on,
you
catch
the
killer,
It's
a
win-win.
Well,
I
thought
you
were
going
rogue,
Oh,
co...
are
you
serious?

Forget
it.
I
gotta
fix
my
equipment.
Gale!
Shit.


Why
don't
you
get


Bravo.
Very,
I'm
very
impressed.
I
mean,
kind...
kind
of
impressed.
-
That'll
do.
-
Yeah.





Don't
answer
it!
-
Hello?
Who
is
this?

No.


and
I
dislike
you
already.
Hicks,
how
far
are
you
-
Five
minutes
at
the
most,
sir.

Look
out
your
window.


Gale!
Aah!

Aah!

Gale!

Aah!
Freeze!
Aaah!


Get
out
of
the
way,
Damn
it.
Okay,
put
pressure
on
that.
Did
you
catch
him?
No.
Hopefully
your
cameras
-
They
weren't
the
only
ones
Dewey.
There's
a
webcam
that's
hidden
-
It
was
watching
me.
He's
recording
the
murders.
What?
This
time...
Sidney
Prescott
detail,
man.
The
cops
guarding
the
house,
-
What
are
you
talkin'
about?
Sucks
to
be
a
cop
in
a
movie,
Not
all
cops
die
in
movies.
No,
but
if
it's
your
last
day
If
you're
a
rookie
just
found
out
Or
if
your
partner's
better-looking

I
win
that
one.

You
know
what?
I'll
be
right
back.
Shit.
You're
not
supposed
to
say
that,
Eh,
new
decade,
new
rules.
You
know,
these
days,
eyes
gouged
out,
-
Could
go
either
way.

I'll
take
this
one.
Hey,
Hoss.
Be
careful.
I'm
always
careful.
Dead
man
walking.


Perkins,
was
there
a
window
open
Perkins,
come
in,
over.


Anthony?
Perkins?
-
Aaah!
-

You
should've
seen
the
look
-

What
the
fuck?
Aah!
Oh,
shit.


Fuck
Bruce
Willis.

Sorry!
That
was
me.
I'm
just
back
from
the
store.
You're
shopping?
My
stress
buster.
Be
right
back.

Jill?


You're
a
survivor,
Your
one
and
only
skill.
I
have
one
question
for
you.
What
good's
it
to
be
a
survivor
if
everyone
close
to
you
is
dead?
-
Who
are
you?
Who
the
fuck
are
you?
Turn
it
on.
...nearly
turned
deadly
tonight
being
the
wife
of
the
Woodsboro
sheriff,
AKA
Gale
Weathers
who's
in
serious
Her
assailant
then
disappeared

Glad
you
came
home,
Sidney?
-
Why
are
you
doing
this?
But
it's
the
family
ties
Am
I
right?
What
do
you
mean?

And
what's
closer
than
family?
-
Don't.
All
you
can
do
is
watch.
Jill!
Come
on,
come
on...
Kate?
-
Sid?
-
Oh,
my
God.
You
gotta
call
her
Okay.

-
Leave
a
message.
-
What's
going
on?
He's
coming
after
me,
-
Oh,
God,
Jill!
-
The
cops
aren't
there.
They
were
there
when
I
first
came
in,
Let's
get
to
Kirby's.
Out
the
front.


Brace
it
from
the
bottom.

-

Kate?
Tell
Jill...
I'm
so...
sorry.
Shh.
Kate?
Hicks?
I
just
saw
somebody
coming
around
Where
are
Hoss
and
Perkins?
Whose
blood
is
that?
It's...
it's
Kate's.
-
She's
dead.
-
Front
door.
Okay.
-
Stay
here.

I've
got
a
homicide
-
No
sign
of
Perkins
or
Hoss.
I'm
so
sorry...

Hey!
Halt!
You're
gonna
be
fine,
all
right?
No
more
"on
your
own."
It's
you
and
me,
forever.
One,
two,
three.
Easy.
-
Dewey?
Promise
me
somethin'.
Anything.

Absolutely.
I
love
you.
You
missed
chaos.
-
I
can't
believe
that.
She
told
us
to
cancel
it,
-
What
are
we
supposed
to
do?
It
makes
sense.
They...
they
one-up
the
original
ending.
The
Woodsboro
Murders
ended
at
a
party.
The
party's
the
false
ending.
Exactly.
Okay,
no
offense,
guys,
-
Nobody
cancels
my
film
festival.
I
don't
wanna
watch
that,
Oh,
come
on,
Oh,
wow,
Kirby.
-
Yup.
You
know
it.
I
could
trivia
your
ass
under
the
table,
Oh,
yeah?
-
Gunnar
Hansen.
That
charge
that
moved
between
us
Oh,
that
was
me.
So
sexy.
You
guys
are
unbelievable.
The
cops
are
gonna
come
for
us.
They're
-
We're
so
dead!
-
Jesus
Christ,
where'd
you
come
from?
By
the
way,
Kirby,
with
everything
you
probably
shouldn't
Sorry.
And,
um,
may
I
ask
What?
No,
you
found
the
anti-party,
Yeah,
well,
I
got
an
invitation.
-
So,
what's
the
story?
You
sent
me
a
text
message.
-
I
mean,
it
was
from
your
phone.
Where
is
my
phone?
I
didn't
text
him.
And
I'll
prove
it.
So,
Charlie,
Robbie.
How's
it
feel
to
be
an
accessories
I
mean,
really,
Dewey's
wife?
My
life
is
over.
So
which
one
of
you
guys
sent
me

We're
just
supposed
to
accept
Isn't
your
phone
missing?
-
Got
a
new
one.
Oh,
-
Dewey,
it's
Hicks.
-
Kate
Roberts
is
dead.
And
Sidney
fled
the
scene.
What?
She
was
stabbed
just
like
the
others.
-
What
about
Jill?
Where
the
hell
They
were
found
dead

Multiple
stab
wounds.
Okay.
I'm
on
my
way.
Yes,
sir.

Wrong
number.
-
Who
was
that?
-
Did
you
pick
a
movie?
-
"Saw
4."
It
sucks.



Charlie,
you
want
to
sit


All
right,
get
ready
for
a
"Hall
Pass"
Now
tonight,
there
is
a
good
chance
yes,
my
Charlie
Walker,
Now
I'm
unable
to,
uh,
suffice
it
to
say,
Woodsboro
High
We'll
see.


Hello?
Who's
there?
Oh,
my
God...
-
Where
are
you
going?

No.
Don't
open
it...
-

Hey,
Charlie?
I'm
sorry,
I
know
you're
into
but
now
would
be
a
really
good
time
For...
me
to
make
a
move?
Mm-hmm.
Couldn't
you
make
a
move?
I
just
did.
'Cause
you're
actually
pretty
cute.
Especially
when
I'm
scared
and...
Hey,
guys,
did...
I
didn't
see
her
outside.
Yes,
Trevor,
she
is
upstairs.
Thank
God
you're
here
to
protect
her
There's
nobody
out
here.

Oh,
dude,
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Just
when
you
think
they're
all
safe
Ghostface
comes
in,
Did
I
just
interrupt
something
Shut
the
fuck
up.
Who
invited
you,
Trevor?!

All
right.
Wow.
I'm
gonna
be
upstairs.
Get
out
of
my
house!
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay,
I'm
a
little
drunk,

Let's
see
Or
the
saga
of
Trevor
and
Jill.
Oh,
Who
needs
a
killer
around

Oh,
man.
That's
better.

Aah!
Agh!
Wait,
no,
you
can't!
I...
I'm
gay!
I'm
gay!
I
mean,
if
it
helps.

...random
girl
who
gets
a
call
that
undoubtedly
ends
up
It's
all
so
predictable.
You
can
see
ev...
Kirby!
I
found
my
phone.
There
was
no
text
message
He
is
such
a
liar.
What
do
you
mean
where
is
he?
He's
not
upstairs.
Trevor?
Charlie?
Robbie?
Maybe
they're
outside.
-

Sidney,
I...
I'm
sorry,
I
should've
told
No,
it's
okay.
It's
just,
-
Come
with
me
right
now,
okay?
Run.
Robbie!

Go!
-
Sidney!
Come
on!
-
The
balcony!
We
can
jump.
It's
two
stories.
-
Uh,
here.
-
What?
Don't
make
a
sound
and
don't
come
out
-
Just
trust
me.
You
got
it?
You're
okay?
Just
keep
running,
get
help!



-

Hello?
-
Sidney,
where
are
you?
The
killer
is
here.
-
I'm
on
my
way.

Sidney?
Sidney!
I
need
all
units
to
329
All
units,

Sorry.
It's
just
me.
Look,
I
tried
to
call
911,
...and
someone
smashed
the
router
Where's
Jill?
Oh,
God.

There's
a
room
down
here.
I
heard
you
yelling
to
Jill.
I
think
she's
safe.


-
Kirby,
let
me
in!
No.
I
just
found
Robbie.
Please.
Please.
Let
me
in!
If
you
can't
trust
him,
My
God,
let
me
in!
Get
away
from
the
door,
Kirby,
it
is
me.
Get
away
from
the
door,
It's
me!

I'm
sorry,
-
What
the
fuck?!
Behind
you!
Look
out!


No!
No,
no,
no!

Kirby!

Oh,
God,
no,
please.
Leave
him
alone!

It's
Charlie's
phone.

Tell
Sidney
heads
Tell
Sidney
Or
maybe
she
wants
to
take
his
place.
-
It's
him.
We
should
be
in
the
same
place.
I'll
be
right
back,
okay?
Let
him
go,
please.
I
hear
you
like
horror
movies,
But
do
you
like
'em
Forget
watching
"Stab."
No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Warm-up
question:
Uh,
it's
a
machete.
There,
you
see?
-
Michael
Myers?
-
Leatherface?
Just
ask
Sidney
-
Freddy
Krueger?!
Name
the
movie
that
started
"Halloween,"
"Texas
Chainsaw
Massacre,"
-
"Psycho"!
"Peeping
Tom,"
1960,
First
movie
to
ever
put
the
audience
What?
Wait.
Please,
just
ask
me
one
more
question!
All
right,
Kirby.
Then
it's
time
Name
the
remake
of
the
groundbreaking
Uh,
"Halloween,"
uh,
"Texas
Chainsaw,"
"The
Hills
Have
Eyes,"
uh,
"Last
House
On
The
Left,"
"A
Nightmare
On
Elm
Street,"
"When
A
Stranger
Calls,"
"House
Of
Wax,"
"The
Fog,"
It's
one
of
those,
right?

I
got
it
right.
I
was
fucking
right.

Jill?
I
won,
Charlie.
I
won.
He
tried
to
beat
me,
Great,
Kirby.
Hold
on.
Just
hang
tight.
-
All
right.
-
Yeah?

Four
years
of
classes
together,
Stupid
bitch!

It's
too
late!
Shh.
Shh.
Oh,
I
know,
I
know.
It's
okay.
Doesn't
happen
as
fast
C...
Charlie...

Charlie...


Kirby?
You
know,

a
lot
when
All
the
plots
Where's
Jill?
Oh,

think
You
think
anyone
gets
away?



-
Jill?
Surprised?
Watch
this.
This
is
the
part,
my
dear
cousin,

Charlie?
Already
taken
care
of.
Man,
I
got
great
footage
Better

Jenny
Good,

cut
and
upload
it
later
Speaking
of
which...

Remind
you
of
anything?
Shut

Dick.
Everything
I
learned,
You
think
you
had
a
shitty
boyfriend,
Here's
one
that
fucks
you,
dumps
you,
Agh!
What

fuck,
Jill?
Shut
the
fuck
up
already!
Agh!
Aagh!
I'm
sure

cops
For
your
protection.
No.
Baby,
please...
Shouldn't
have
killed
Gone

put
it
on
video
even.
But
it
means
What
the
fuck
I
am
not
the
girl

on.
Aagh!
Aaaagh!
I've
gone
through
everything.
Oh,
yeah.
No,

please!

Ready
for
act
three?
Got
it
figured
out
yet,
Sidney?
In
keeping
with
our
remake
theme,
Trevor's
this
generation's
and
we're
the
innocent
victims,
See,
with
you,
the
world
-
But
with
us,
they're
gonna
see
it.
It's
gonna
be
a
worldwide
sensation.
It's
not
like
anyone
reads
anymore.
We're
gonna
know
fame
Last
two
teenagers
standing.
This
time
Randy
gets
the
girl.
You
were
amazing.
I
was
so
believable
today,
I
mean,
I
told
so
many
lies
I
really
think
How
could
you
do
this?
Do
you
know
what
it
was
like
Related
to
you?
I
mean,
all
I
ever
heard
and
Sidney
that
You
were
always
Well,
You'll
slip.
Hm.

on,
baby,
get
it
up!
Come
on.
Shoulder
me!
Get
it
up!

The
heart...
You
said
it,
Charlie.
What
the
media
really
loves,
baby,
Just
ask
you-know-who.
Trevor
was
your
partner.

Even
your
friends.
My
friends?
What
world
are
you
living
in?
I
don't
need
friends.
I
need
fans.
Don't
you
get
it?!
This
has
never
been
It's
about...
I
mean,
for
fuck's
sake,
no
great
loss
there...
That's
sick,
right?
Well,
sick
is
the
new
sane.
You
had
your
fifteen
minutes.
Now
I
want
mine!
I
mean,
what
am
I
supposed
to
do?
Grad
school?
Work?
Look
around.
We
all
live
in
public
now,
How
do
you
think
people
You
don't
have
to
achieve
anything.
You

gotta
have
So,
you
do
have
to

mom.
Shh.
Just

Try

fine.
If
I

a
book
one
day,
I'd...
We'd
be
a
good
team
We're
survivors
now.

Jill...

It's
still

But

ICU.
And

But...

her.
Look,

alternate
ending.
You're
