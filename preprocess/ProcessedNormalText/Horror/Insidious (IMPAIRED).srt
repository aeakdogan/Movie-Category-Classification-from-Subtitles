went
into

was

I
could
feel
in

I
went
into

was
something
It
was
standing
there
I
asked
it,
"Who
are
you?"
And
it
said
it
was
a
visitor.
I
said,
"What
do
you
want?"

It
said,

he
is
a

accomplished
He's
been
doing

has
been

What
does
that

without

It's
a
dark
realm
filled
with
a

not
That's
where
Dalton
is.
And
the
problem
is
that
he's
just
left
us
with
a

there
are

that
know
That's
why
they're

these
the
things

all
trying
to

crave

But
there
are

who
are
malevolent
and
have
a
more

then,
there's

he's

is
kept
away
from

easier
it
is

there

we
can
do
There's
something

unorthodox.

I
would
need

no,
no.
I'm

What?
No,
please,

I
have
given

I
can't
have

telling
us
the

gonna
