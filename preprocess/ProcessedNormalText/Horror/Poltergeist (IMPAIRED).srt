Hello.

louder.
I

you.
Hey,

I

Five.
Yes.

Damn

Tweety?
Ohh.
Oh,

Tweety,
couldn't

Who
the
hell
is
this
guy?
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
STEVEN:
All
right!
Freeling,
what's
going
on
here?
I
apologize.

-I
bet
my
life
on
this
game!
Hi,
Ben.
We
got
a
good
football
game
My
kids
want
to
watch
Mister
Rogers.
I
don't
care
what
you're
watching.
Steve,
look
at
this
guy!
Move
your
set.
Move
yours.
There
it
is.
Okay,
don't
move.

Tweety
doesn't
like
that
smell.
DIANE:
Put
a
flower
with
him.
A
flower?
Okay.
For
when
he's
hungry.
For
when
he's
lonely.
And
when
it's
nighttime.

Oh,
it's
okay.
Shh.
Now
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep...
...l
pray
the
Lord
my
soul
to
keep.
Oh,
brother.
DIANE:
If
I
should
die
before
I
wake...
DANA
:
...l
pray
the
Lord
my
soul
to
take.
That
was
lovely.
Lovely,
honey.
Mom,
when
it
rots,
Robbie!
Will
you
come
on
down
out
E.
Buzz!
Can
I
get
a
goldfish
now?
Come
and
get
it.

DIANE:
Tweety
Two
and
Tweety
Three
DIANE:
You
know
what
happens
They
grow
up
to
be...
...sharks!

Good
night.
Mom,
there's
a
big
storm
DIANE:
You'll
be
asleep
by
the
time
Come
on.
In
you
go.
-Good
night.
Okay,
lights
out.
Closet
light!
Closet
light!
My
fault,
my
fault.
CAROL
ANNE:
That
enough?
-Okay?
Night,
Mommy.
DIANE
:
Either
I'm
dead
or
I'm
crazy.
Well,
you're
not
crazy,
Pete.
-You
mean
I'm
dead?
I'm....
You
mean
I....
This
is
for
good?
DIANE:
Nocturnal
somnambulism.
You
know
what?
You
know
what?

I
mean,
Carol
Anne
last
night,
And
me
when
I
was
10.
-Would
you
deal
with
this
for
me?

You
know....

You
know,
And
I
fell
asleep
in
the
back
He
drove
all
the
way
to
work
God,
I
woke
up,
I
started
screaming.
People
came
running
from
everywhere.
They
took
this
poor
dude
downtown.
-My
father...
-...Ed.
Big
Ed
has
me
examined
for
bruises
God,
I
was
so
embarrassed.

Oh,
shit,
Steven.
What
if
we
dig
the
pool
...and
she
falls
into
it
Oh,
honey,
no.
Have
you
ever
dove
off
-What's
three
meters?
Let's
just
dig
the
pool
...and
let
the
kids
jump
off
the
roof.
STEVEN:
Honey,
a
three-meter
board,
When
you
dive
off,

You
got
to
get
your
position
now.
-Honey?
Your
diving
days
are
over.
We're
talking
Olympics,
Diane.
Okay?
-And
then
I
can--
Then
we
can
jackknife
into
the
swan.

You
twist,
turn
and...
...splash!
Honey,
it's
right
to
the
Nautilus
machine.
Look
at
this,
honey.
Before,
after.
Before,
after.
Before,
after.


Don't.
I'm
telling
you.

You
fool.

No,
no!
Oh,
God,
I
love
it
when
you
talk
dirty.
The
storm's
coming
closer.
Hey,
partner.
Hi,
honey.
Is
everything
okay?
It's
thundering.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Hop
up.
I'm
the
wind
and
you're
the
feather.
-Say
good
night
to
Mom.
DIANE:
Here
we
go.
I
don't
like
the
tree,
Dad.
It's
an
old
tree.
It
was
here
before
my
company
I
don't
like
its
arms.

It
knows
everything
about
us.
So
it
could
protect
us.
You
and
Carol
Anne
and
Dana
It's
a
very
wise
old
tree.

I
think
the
storm's
gonna
pass
us.
How
do
you
know?
Because
I
can
count.
You
know
what
you
do?
When
you
see
the
lightning...
...you
count
till
you
hear
the
thunder.
If
you
can
count
higher
each
time...
...that
means
the
storm's
moving
away
Want
to
try
it?
Okay.
Get
some
lightning.
Wait,
it's
coming.
Wow.
-Okay.
One...
-...two,
three.

Okay,
but
I
bet
next
time
you'll
be
able

-Betcha.
You
tell
them
to
take
a
message,
My
dad
wants
to
take
a
message.
Good
night.
It's
too
hot.
Okay.
Good
night,
angel.
Happy
dreams,
okay?
CAROL
ANNE:
ROBBIE:
...three,
four.

DANA:
Come
on.
-Good
night,
Dana.
-Get
off
the
phone,
Dana.
Mm-hm.
One,
two....
Three,
four....
Five....

They're
here.
STEVEN:
Now
listen
to
me,
Jeff.
No.
I
know,
how
could

There
was
damage.
The
bedroom.
ROBBIE:
STEVEN:
We've
been
listening
to
the
radio.
DANA:
STEVEN:
You
are
so
obnoxious!
You
drive
me
nuts!
You're
obnoxious.
-Force

That
was
a
good
one.
This
means
war,
and
I
mean
it!
CAROL
ANNE:
Hey,
watch
out!
You're
a
big
barf
bag!
You're
a
doggy
bag.
That's
a
good
one.
I'm
not
gonna
eat
it.
DIANE:
Sweetheart,
last
night
when
you
said,
Can
I
take
my
goldfish
to
school?
Maybe
the
fault
line
runs
Wouldn't
that
be
a
scream?
The
ceiling
got
crumbs
on
my
bed.
DANA:
Who
cares?
Do
you
remember
when
you
woke
up
CAROL
ANNE:
Who
did
you
mean?
Who's
here?
The
TV
people.
ROBBIE:
She's
stoned.
More
than
you!
Ask
Dad.
-Ask

-Ask

Ask

Ask
Dad.
Hey!
It's
not
my
mess.
Uch!
Thanks
a
lot,
jerko.
ROBBIE:
Mom!
It's
not
my
fault.
The
earth
moved
for
you?
It
wasn't
quite
the
same
thing
Okay.
I'll
talk--
Yeah,
right.
Okay.
Give
me
that
before
you
cut
yourself.
ROBBIE:
It's
not
my
fault.
-I'm
out
of

ROBBIE:
I'm
out
of

You,
I
can
handle.
-Got
school.
All
right.
I'll
just
flunk.

WORKER

Don't

so

-How
is
it?
Okay,
Bluto.
Give

You

You

This
is
our
latest
development.
We
call
this
Phase
4.
Where
do
you
live,
Mr.
Freeling?
Well,
we
were
the
first
family
to
set
up
Phase
1.
We
had
to
pass
through
my
neighborhood
Oh,
that
area
with
the
lived-in
look.
It
has
that,
but
I
think
in
a
few
months...
...you
won't
be
able
to
distinguish
You
know,
we
have
a
saying
around
here.

That's
the
way
I
feel.
MAN:
You
know
something?
I
think
you're
right.
But
I
think
our
construction
standards
I
have
this
neighbor
and
he
built
a
Jacuzzi
...and
it
has
a
running
aqueduct
connected
It's
built
half
in
and
half
out
That
house
was
featured
Come
on,
I'll
show
you
the
den.
Honey!
Come
here!
Quick!
-Hurry!
Before
it
stops
again.
DIANE:
Leave
this
here.
They
don't
make
the
pick-ups
yet.
-Okay,
just
stand
right
here.
Okay?
Listen,
I
kept
Dana
and
Robbie
out
of
this...
...but
Carol
Anne
was
here,
But
Dana
would
blab,
and
Robbie,
-...sleeping
on
your
side
of
the
bed.
No,
no,
no.
Now
just
stand,
okay?
-Now,
just
be
calm.
Now
reach
back
into
our
past
-Remember
that?
Okay.
Just
try
to
use
that
-Okay?
Mother
didn't
cook
any
dinner.
We'll
go
to
Pizza
Hut,
okay?
Okay,
now....
Now
just
look.
Just
look.
Just
watch.
DIANE:

STEVEN:
Come
here,
sweetheart.
Honey,
could
you
move
the
chair
-Baby,
let's
show
Daddy.
Don't
argue
with
Mommy.
Come
on.
Come
on,
let's
just
do
this
once.
Okay,
here
we
go.
I
want
pepperoni
pizza.
Mommy,
that
burns.
DIANE:
-Steven,
come
on,
you
do
it.
DIANE:
Come
on,
honey,
try.
It's
like
there's
this
tickling,
And
it
starts
to
pull
you.
All
of
a
sudden
it's
like
there's
no
air,
And
you're
getting
pulled
along
and--
-Hi,
Ben.
If
you're
having
problems
No,
no,
no.
Diane
and
I
were
just
wondering....
This
will
sound
strange
Doubt
that.

-Those
mosquitoes
are
something
else.
I've
never
been
bothered
by
them.
In
fact,
I
don't
think
As
far
as
I
know,
nobody
in
my
family's
-A
mosquito
ever
suck
on
you,
son?
He
don't
know.
DIANE:

Look,
Mr.
Tuthill....
Ben.

-Ben.
DIANE:
We
were
just....
Look.
Diane,
my
wife,
Ben,
something
funny
Something,
uh....
We
were
wondering
if
maybe
you
had
What
kind
of
disturbances?
Um....
Oh,
you
know,
like...
...dishes
or
furniture
moving
around
Don't
scratch
them.
You'll
infect
them.
-Just
let
me
put
this
on.
Don't!
Boy,
did
I
feel
like
a
fool.
I'm
sorry,
but
I
had
to
say
it.
We
were
losing
pints
of
blood.
We'll
keep
this
thing
in
the
family.
-Don't
scratch.
Yeah?
Who,
for
instance?
I
looked
in
the
yellow
pages.

no
listing.

there
been

STEVEN:
Can
you
be
reasonably
sure
STEVEN:

haven't
even
gone
to
the
police.
LESH:
Would
your
family
welcome
a
serious

someone
who
can
make
Look,
Dr.
Lesh,
...the
pounding
and
the
flashing...
...the
screaming,
the
music.
We
just
want
you
to
find
our
little
girl.
I
should
warn
you
that
we
keep
the
room
Robbie's
sleeping
with
us
now
LESH:
Well,
how
many
disturbances
We
don't
go
in
the
room
anymore.
Mr.
Freeling,
we'll
record

photographed
an

It
was

child's
toy,
Just
rolled
seven
feet
across
The
duration
of
the
event
Seven
hours
for
what?
For
the
vehicle
to
complete
the
distance.
Of
course,
this
would
never
register
But
I
have
it
recorded
It's
fantastic.
Mm-hm.






DIANE:
We've
been
trying
to
hold
ourselves
Of
course,
no
one's
been
sleeping
much.
Steven
has
missed
so
much
work.
But
he's
been
wonderful,
How
long
have
you
been
investigating
LESH:
Well,
Mrs.
Freeling,
l--
Diane,
the
determination
as
to
whether
I--
What
I
meant
to
say
was,
it
might
...instead
of
a
classic
haunting.
There's
a
difference?
Did
you
see
that?
There'll
be
two
more
in
a
few
seconds.
Dr.
Casey.

Gotta
be
quicker
than
that
around
here.
It's
electrical.
You
can
smell
the
charge.
You
were
saying
about
poltergeists?
Poltergeists
are
usually
associated
Hauntings
seem
to
be
connected
A
house,
usually.
Poltergeist
disturbances
Perhaps
a
couple
of
months.
Hauntings
can
go
on
for
years.
Are
you
telling
me
that
all
of
this
Yes,
it
could.
Unless
it's
a
haunting.
But
hauntings
don't
usually
revolve
Then
we
don't
have
much
time...
...because
my
daughter
is
alive

:
--while
trying
to
escape

listed
as

This
is
probably
gonna
seem
We
hear
better
on
this
channel.
Well,
uh...
...l
guess
I'll
call
her.
Carol
Anne?
Uh,
it's
Mommy,
sweetheart.
Uh,
we
want
to
talk
to
you.

Please
answer
me.
Please
talk
to
me,

Look
at
the
dog.

DIANE:
Can
you
say
hello
to
Daddy?

CAROL
ANNE:

Hello,
sweetpea.
It's
Mommy,
sweetheart.
Hello,
Mommy.
Hello,
baby!
Can
you
see
me?
Can
you
see
Mommy?
Mommy?
Where
are
you?
Where
are
you?
We're
home,
baby.
We're
home.
Can
you
find
me?
Mommy,
where
are
you?
I'm
afraid
of
the
light,
Mommy.
I'm
afraid
of
the
light!
Tell
her
to
stay
away
from
the
light.
Maybe
it's
a
way
out!
It
is
a
way
out,
but
not
for
her.
-Uh,
Carol
Anne--
STEVEN:
Sweetheart,
stay
away
from
the
light.
The
light
is
dangerous.
Don't
go
near
it.
-Don't
even
look
at
it.
I
don't
believe
it,
but
the
voice
could
be

What
the
hell
is
this?

ANNE:

CAROL
ANNE:
No,
it's
not
Mommy.
Who
is
it,
Dr.
Lesh?
-Who's
with
you,
baby?
Mommy,
somebody's
coming.
DIANE:
God.
My
God.
My
baby.
No.
You
bastard!
She's
just
a
baby!
Help
her!
Can't
you
hear

STEVEN:
Listen!
Listen!
Leave
me
alone!
Mommy,
help
me!
Help
me,
Mommy!

She
just
moved
through
me.
My
God!
I
felt
her.

I
can
smell
her.
It's
her.
Smell
my
clothes.
-It's
her.
She's
all
over
me.
DIANE:
STEVEN:
It
is.
It's
her.
It
is.
It
is.
It's
my
baby.
It's
my
baby.
She
went
through
my
soul.



ROBBIE:

DIANE:
I
can't
hear
her
anymore.
Where
exactly
do
you
suppose
Carol
Anne
Diane?
Where
was
Carol
Anne
playing
Her
bedroom
closet.
Let's
go
up
there.
-They
won't
let
you
in.

LESH:
I
was
about
to
check
out
...something
took
a
bite
out
of
me.
You
got
bit?
That
or
the
worst
muscle
spasm
Lift
up
your
shirt.
Let's
have
a
look.
Wow!
We'll
spend
the
night
downstairs.
No.
Wrong!
Wrong,
wrong,
wrong.
Honey,
I
want
you
...and
spend
tonight
in
town.
I
am
not
leaving
here
DANA:
I
can't
stay
here.
-No,
you
go,
baby.
I'm
not
gonna
leave
anybody

Let's
go.

There's
some
ionization
flux.
I'd
like
to
see
that
they're
not
caused
...but
I'm
not
going
up
there
to
find
out.
We
have
got
much
more
than
There
is
a
measurable
physical
science
...any
of
the
creaking
doors
The
voice
on
the
television,
The
absence
of
a
signal
on
a
channel
that
...it's
free
to
receive
a
lot
of
noise
Solar
disturbances,
car
ignition
sparkings.
Outer
space.
Or
inner
space.
Yes.
What
if
these
people
had
an
area
LESH:
What
do
you
mean?
If
that
is
the
way
out...
...then
maybe
somewhere
in
this
house

Thanks.
You
know,
when
it's
quiet
like
now...
...l
can
imagine
how
all
of
this
must
look
I'm
really
embarrassed.
Nonsense.
I'm
the
one
who
should
be
embarrassed,
Parapsychology
isn't
something
There
are
no
certificates
of
graduation...
...no
licenses
to
practice.
I
am
a
professional
psychologist...
...who
spent
most
of
my
time
engaged
...which
makes
me,
I
suppose,
the
most
Would
you
like
a
glass
for
that?
No,
thank
you.
You
know,
you
were
very
funny.
Your
hands
were
shaking

It
isn't
over.
I'm
absolutely
terrified.
It's
all
the
things
I
feel
like
the
protohuman,
...and
seeing
the
moon
for
the
first
time
If
I
got
killed,
would
I
come
back
as
a
ghost
...like
my
sister?
Your
sister
isn't
dead,
Robbie.
If
I
got
killed,
could
I
visit
her
You
could
tie
a
rope
around
me
and
hold
it,
...and
we'd
go
live
somewhere
else.
Some
people
believe
that
when
you
die
When
Grandpa
was
dead,
I
looked
at
him
...but
I
didn't
see
anything
His
soul
was
invisible,
Robbie.
But
how
come
Grandpa
isn't
on
television
Shh.
LESH:
Some
people
believe
...there's
a
wonderful
light...
...as
bright
as
the
sun.
All
the
answers
to
all
the
questions
...are
inside
that
light.
And
when
you
walk
to
it,
And
then...
...some
people
die,
They
think
they're
still
alive?
Yes.
Maybe
they
didn't
want
to
die.
Maybe
they
weren't
ready.
Maybe
they
hadn't
lived
fully
yet
...but
they
still
wanted
more
life.
They
resist
going
into
that
light...
...however
hard
the
light
wants
them.
They
just
hang
around...
...watch
TV,
...feeling
unhappy
and
jealous...
...and
those
feelings
are
bad.
They
hurt.
And
then...
...some
people...
...just
get
lost
on
the
way
to
the
light.
And
they
need
someone
So
some
people
get
angry
and
Yes.
Just
like
in
school.
Like
some
kids
are
nice
to
you,
I
got
beat
up
once
by
three
kids.
They
took
my
lunch
money.
Maybe
they
got
hit
by
a
truck
Listen,
partner,
maybe
we
ought
Okay.
You
know
what?
When
we
called
Grandma
tonight,
...that
you're
coming
to
stay
with
her...
...and
she's
planning
all
these
neat
things
-Can
I
take
E.
Buzz
with
me
when
we
go?
-Good
night,
Mom.
Good
night,
lady.
Good
night,
Dad.
Good
night,
Rob.
I
love
you.
Good
night,
Carol

Roll

Yes,

Look
at
all
of
them.
ROBBIE
:
Who
are
all
those

They're
so
lonely.
So
alone.
Where

I

Robbie?
Call

This
cameo
is
over
100
years
old.
DIANE:
And
this
watch
is
only
a
few
years
old.
No.
Well,
I'm
off.
I'm
taking
these
back
to
the
lab
I'm
gonna
have
to
display
these,
-Please,
not
on
60
Minutes.

I'll
get
it.
Excuse
me.

LESH:
Marty
won't
be
coming
back.
I
am
coming
back.

Try
not
to
worry.

We've
missed
you
down
at
the
office.
...so
I
took
it
upon
myself
to--
Jesus,
Steve,
you
look
like
shit.
I'm
still
weak.
I've
got
the
flu.
-I
can't
get
up
and
l--
Yeah,
well,
move
over
here.
We'll
have
to
look
into
that.
No,
it's
just
us.
Got
some
electrical
problems
What
have
you
got
screwed
in
there?
You
afraid
of
burglars
or
you
trying
Steve,
tell
me
something.
-Yes,
I
am.
...but
we
don't
want
to
lose
the
best
rep
...to
the
flu
or
other
opportunities.
Seeing
all
that
software
in
your
living
room
...maybe
you
got
something
on
the
side.
STEVEN:
No,
I
just
read
Popular
Mechanics.
Feel
like
going
for
a
little
ride?
I'd
like
to
show
you
something.
Hello?
Carol
Anne?

I'm
sorry!
I'm
sorry!
One
of
your
children
was
born
Carol
Anne.
I
understand
that
she's
missed
One
of
Trask's
daughters
She
caught
the
flu
as
well?
Yeah,
we've
all
got
the
same
thing.
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
see
her.
She's
around.
Listen,
I
wonder
if
you'd
mind
Are
you
leaving
Cuesta
Verde?
STEVEN:
It's
hard
to
believe
the
day
How
could
anyone
in
the
world
How's
that
spot
for
a
bay
window,
huh?
It's
pretty
nice
if
you're
living
up
here,
...looking
at
those
homes
You
don't
have
to
live
What
are
you
saying?
We're
starting
Phase
5
right
here
All
of
this
can
be
That
can
be
your
view.
Interested?
Mr.
Teague,
that's
a
generous
offer.
-I'm
just
not
a
developer.
That's
almost
half
of
everything
there.
Almost
$70
million
worth
Now,
that's
a
whole
generation
...that
nobody
can
put
a
price
tag
on.

Look,
I
know
we
should
have
made
you
Well,
I
don't
want
to
lose
you
now.
-Not
much
room
for
a
pool,
is
there?
We've
already
made
arrangements
STEVEN:
-Come
on.
That's
sacrilegious,
isn't
it?
After
all,
It's
just...
...people.
Besides,
we've
done
it
before.
-When?
Right
down
there.
-Cuesta
Verde?
And
let
me
tell
you,
it
was
quite
a
deal.
STEVEN:
It's
not
something
one
advertises
...or
on
the
side
of
a
bus.
What's
worrying
you?
Friends
and
relatives
can
visit
It's
only
five
minutes
further,
Yeah,
well,
five
minutes.
I
suppose
that
would
be
okay.
Okay
with
whom?
Whomever
might
complain.
Nobody's
complained
until
now.
DIANE:
We've
had
two
experiences
Uh,
this
is
the
den.
Would
y'all
mind
hanging
back?

So,
what
side
of
the
rainbow
Is
this
your
Knott's
Berry
Farm
solution?
I
know
what
you're
thinking.
She's
cleaned
many
houses.
Her
gifts
have
been
documented--
Look,
we
haven't
heard
Carol
Anne
TANGINA:
-Answer
her,
Steven.
I
am
addressing
the
living.
I'm
sorry.
Sorry.
That's
the
room
my
son
LESH:
This
house
has
many
hearts.

What's
the
matter?


...and
she
couldn't
hear
me.
I
thought
you
said

TANGINA:
I
just
don't
like
trick
answers.
Come
here,
honey...
...and
give

not
gonna
bite
you.
Come
on
down

You're

Your
daughter
is
alive
and
in
this
house.

Where
was
the
last
incident
I
get
my
strongest
feeling...
...the
point
of
origin
is
Yes,
I
believe
that
too.
Now,
honey,
are
you
gonna
be
strong
I
can
do
absolutely
nothing
...and
your
love
for
the
children.
I
will.
Believe
me,
I
will.
And
will
you
do
anything
I
ask...
...even
if
it
comes
contrary
to
your
beliefs
Yes,
I
promise.
Please.
Would
you
all
come
on
in?
Gather
round.
There
is
no
death.
It
is
only
a
transition...
...to
a
different
sphere
of
consciousness.
Carol
Anne
is
not
like
those
she's
with.
She
is
a
living
presence...
...in
their
spiritual,
earthbound
plane.
They're
attracted
to
the
one
thing
...that
is
different
from
themselves:
It
is
very
strong.
It
gives
off
its
own
illumination.
It
is
a
light
that
implies
life...
...and
memory
of
love
and
home...
...and
earthly
pleasures...
...something
they
desperately
desire...
...but
can't
have
anymore.
Right
now,
...and
that
is
a
terrible
distraction...
...from
the
real
light...
...that
has
finally
come
for
them.
Do
you
understand
me?
These
souls,
who,
for
whatever
reason...
...are
not
at
rest...
...are
also
not
aware
They're
not
part
of
consciousness
They
linger
in
a
perpetual
dream
state...
...a
nightmare
from
which
Inside
this
spectral
light...
...is
salvation.
A
window
to
the
next
plane.
They
must
pass
through
this
membrane...
...where
friends
are
waiting
Carol
Anne
must
help
them
cross
over.
And
she
will
only
hear...
...her
mother's
voice.
Now...
...hold
onto
yourselves.
There's
one
more
thing.
A
terrible
presence
is
in
there
with
her.
So
much
rage,
so
much
betrayal.
I've
never
sensed
anything
like
it.
I
don't
know
what
hovers
...but
it
was
strong
enough
...and
take
your
daughter
away
from
you.
It
keeps
Carol
Anne
very
close
to
it...
...and
away
from
the
spectral
light.
It
lies
to
her.
It
says
things
It
has
been
using
her
To
her...
...it
simply
is
another
child.
To
us...
...it
is
the
beast.
Now
let's
go
get
your
daughter.
TANGINA:
...handkerchiefs...
...tennis
balls.
STEVEN:
TANGINA:
Bath
water?
All
right.
Call
to
her.
Carol
Anne?
Carol
Anne,
it's
Mommy.
Carol
Anne,
please
tell
Mommy
hello.
Try
again.
Can
you
say
hello
to
Daddy?
Daddy
and
I
miss
you
so
much.
So
much.
We
love
you
so
much.
Please
just
say
hello.
She's
under
restraint.
What?
Who's
restraining
her?
There
are
many
arms
about
her.
Who
is
she
more
threatened
by,
Neither!
Steve
decides
the
punishment.
-That's
not
fair.
I've
never
hit
her.
Steven,
make
Carol
Anne
answer
you!
-Carol
Anne?
It's
Daddy.
Be
angry
with
her,
Carol
Anne,
I
want
you
to
answer
me!
Tell
her
if
she
doesn't
answer
you,
-Come
on,
I've
never
spanked
the
children.
Carol
Anne?
Answer
your
parents
or
you'll
get
CAROL
ANNE:
TANGINA:
She's
away
from
him.
Diane,
ask
about
the
light.
CAROL
ANNE:
Carol
Anne?
-Honey,
do
you
see
a
light?
Mommy!
Mommy,
help
me!
Shh.
-Tell
her
to
go
to
the
light.
They'll
follow
her,
they've
followed
her
-You
must
do
what
I
say.
Mommy,
I
can't
find
you!
Run
to
the
light,
Carol
Anne!
-Are
you
in
the
light?
TANGINA:
Tell
her
you
are.
You
can't
choose
life
or
death
when
Tell
her
before
it's
too
late.
Run
to
the
light,
baby!
-Mommy's
in
the
light!
Mommy
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
light!
Now
clear
your
minds.
It
has
from
the
very
beginning.
Don't
give
it
any
help.
Now,
open
the
door.
Ryan!
Get
downstairs
and
wait
by
the
target!
Okay!
TANGINA:
Give
me
the
tennis
ball

Dr.
Lesh!

my
handwriting!

ball
came
back!
It's
his
handwriting.

Kiss
my
ass!
Number
two!
TANGINA:
Give
me
your
hand!
She's
at
the
mouth
of
the
corridor!
Tell
her
to
stop!
Tell
her
not
to
go
into
the
light!
Carol
Anne?
Listen
to
me!
Do
not
go
into
the
light!
Stop
where
you
are!
Turn
away
from
it!
Don't
even
look
at
it!
Hurry
with
the
rope!
Throw
it
into
the
light!

Fantastic!
I
got
it!
Tell
him
to
take
up
the
slack
gently.
Take
up
the
slack!
Okay!
TANGINA:
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
going
in
after
her!
She
won't
come
to
you!
Let
me
go!
You've
never
done
this
before.
DIANE:

right.
You
go.
-No!
No!
Let
me!
Who's
strong
enough
to
stay
up
here

TANGINA:
No!
Go
downstairs
and
wait
by
Ryan...
...and
pull
only
when
I
say
so!
Steven!
Don't
let
go!
Never!

will
we
know
she's
got
her?
When
will
we
know?
Hey!
Cross
over,
children!
All
are
welcome!
All
welcome.
Go
into
the
light!
No!
No!
You
said
no!
There
is
peace
and
serenity
in
the
light.
You
said
don't
go
into
the
light!
Diane!
Steven,
not
yet!

LESH:

here!
Diane!
No,

Get
them
into

water!

get
her
something....
Don't
worry.
Get

to

water.

all
right.

on.
Come
on,
breathe
now.
Just
take
a
breath.

damn
it!
Breathe!

I'm
going
to
dinner
-Is
your
room
packed?
CAROL
ANNE:
Mom?
Uh,
I
guess
not.
So
you
better
get
Brian
to
bring
you
home
Because
Dad
wants
us
to
stay
-Oh,
yeah.
I
remember
that
place.
-You
what?
-Are
you
gonna
do
anything
about
this?
Your
new
gray.
Oh.

ANNE:
Mom?
-You
don't
think
it's
kind
of
punk?
Bye,
Mom.
Okay,
Rob.
That
thing
almost
killed
me.
DIANE:
You
okay?
Don't
hurt
your
back.
-How
you
feeling?
I
feel
a
little
hung
over,
...but
I
feel
good,
Steven,
I
really
do.
She
doesn't
seem
to
remember
any
of
it.
Oh,
what
a
day.
Smell
that
mimosa.
Cut
yourself
a
bouquet
to
take
with
you,
I
know.
We
worked
so
hard
for
this.
-Many
beautiful
memories.
...and
pick
up
some
stuff.
DIANE:
Okay.
-So
we're
leaving
tonight
for
sure?
I'll
tell
you
what.
If
the
kids
get
sleepy
How's
Teague
taking
it?
He
won't
take
"Go
to
hell"
-What
are
you
gonna
tell
him?


DIANE:
"Working
from
front
to
back,
apply
-Gently
work
it--"
CAROL
ANNE:
No!
Give
me
this!
Stop!
Give
me
my
truck.
CAROL
ANNE:
"Gently
work
it
through
...then
comb
through
...to
be
sure
that
every
hair
is
wet.
-You!
Give
me
this!
Give
me
it!
-It's
getting
late,
guys.
-Give
it
back
to
me!
Stop
it.
I'll
be
in

Could

answer
And
