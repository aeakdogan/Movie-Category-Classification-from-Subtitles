Oh,
fuck!

I
wasn't
trying
to
escape.

No,
please.
Oh,
God.
I
don't
want
to
die.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'll
make
you
clean.
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to...



Hey,
sis.
What
time
is
it?
Just
after
8:00.
You
want
me
to
make
coffee?
No,
I
gotta
go.
I'll
call
you
later.
You
sure
there's
nothing
I
can
do?
Angie,
everything's
gonna
be
fine.

LORENZO
ON
INTERCOM:
BEN:
Ben
Carson.
Lorenzo
Sapelli.
I've
been
waiting
for
you.
BEN:
Thanks.
How
long
you
been
working
here?
LORENZO:
All
together?
Fifteen
years.
BEN:
You
were
here
for
the
fire?
LORENZO:
Devastating.
Entire
building
up
in
flames.

It
has
been
five
years
since
the
fire.
They're
still
in
a
legal
battle
Even
cleaning
up
this
mess
is
impossible.
I've
given
up
faith
about
reopening,
who'd
ever
want
to
shop
here
You
know,
the
Meredith
family
after
St.
Matthew's
Hospital
It
was
the
very
first
Mayflower
Yeah,
the
company
wants
us
to
patrol
but
I
do
my
rounds
every
three.
Anyway,
you'll
see,
not
too
much
Well,
there
you
go.
Perfume
and
cosmetics
department,
Thank
God
you
didn't
show
up
any
later.
No
electricity.
All
these
mirrors.
-
Best
to
keep
your
eyes
away
from
them.
-
I'm
sorry?
No,
that's
Gary.
Gary
Lewis.
Fellow
who
was
working
here
before
you.
He
was
completely
obsessed
Spent
the
entire
night
cleaning
them.
How
long
has
it
been
About
a
year.
I
know
it's
none
of
my
business,
You
used
to
be
a
detective,
Yeah.
I'm
sorry.

I
always
been
too
curious.
It's
all
right.
LORENZO:
There
was
a
pretty
big
team
You
know,
when
you
stop
to
think,
this
one
was
the
most
beautiful,
I
mean,
it
breaks
your
heart,
it
really
does.
Well,
here
you
go.
This
is
where
you'll
be
spending
At
least
you
got
electricity
in
here.
It's
warm.
It's
nice.
You've
even
got
a
TV.
WOMAN
ON
TV:
I
opened
up
the
trunk,
I
grabbed
the
goody
bag,
opened
up
the

grill,
Waiting

Exhale.
Hello?
ROSA:
Hello.
-
Hey,
Rosa,
how
are
you
doing?
Thanks.
Where
are
the
kids?
Upstairs
with
Seor
Ben.
AMY:
Thanks.
DAISY:
So
everybody
at
my
school
which
is,
like,
one
of
my
best
friends,
And
this
girl
named
Christiana,
BEN:
You
want
me
to
talk
to
Mrs.
Ward?
She'll
make
them
want
to
wrap
me
up
-
Hey.
Look,
Mommy.
Look
what
Daddy
got
me.
It
looks
great.
You'll
have
to
show
me
It's
so
fast,
Mommy.
Ben?
Can
I
talk
to
you?
Yeah.
Okay,
you
two.
You
need
to
finish
your
homework.
Come
on.
No
fooling
around,
let's
go.
Okay,
let's
go,
Michael.
Hey.
Come
here.
Happy,
happy
birthday.
MICHAEL:
Thanks,
Dad.
-
Hey.

-
What
is
this?
I've
asked
you
You
won't
answer
my
calls.

Please,
Ben,
I
don't
want
to
argue,
either.
If
you're
not
I
haven't
had
a
drink
but
since
you
won't
answer
your
calls,
I
don't
want
to
know.
What
I
want
is
for
you
Amy,
I'm
doing
everything
I
can
I
haven't
had
a
drink.
I
got
a
new
job
to
hold
me
over
I'm
doing
everything
I
can
What?
You
don't
think
people
can
change?
We're
not
talking
about
people.
Amy,
I
killed
a
man.
You
don't
just
get
over
that.
I
needed
time.
I
needed
you.
-
I
was
right
here.
Judging
me
like
everybody
else.
How
dare
you
say
that
to
me?
I
was
the
only
one
at
the
precinct
How
many
times
did
I
chase
reporters
How
can
you
say
that
to
me?
I've
always
been
in
your
corner!
I've
been
the
only
one
You're
fucking
unbelievable!
Please,
I
didn't
come
here
to
fight.
Look,
I'm
sorry
that
I
came
over
I
just
wanted
to
see
them.
But
we
have
to
set
up
some
rules.
What
fucking
rules?
Come
on,
Amy,
so
I
can
see
my
son
on
his
birthday!
Look
at
yourself.
This
is
exactly
what
I'm
talking
about.
I
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
be
When
I
get
around
you,
I
get
nervous.
Because
I
am
so
scared
And
I
screw
everything
up.
-
I've
missed
you
so
much.
Amy,
we
deserve
another
chance.
I
know
how
much
I
love
you,
and
I
know
Please.
Please.
AMY:
I
can't
do
this.
I
can't
do
this,
Ben.
Fuck.






Holy
shit.


What
the
hell?
Fuck!
Man.
What
the...
-
You
should
stop
taking
those
pills.

How
are
you
doing
today?
I'm
fine.
I
feel
a
lot
better.
Are
you
sure
you're
all
right?
Please,
not
you.
Okay.
I'm
just
saying,
I'm
your
little
sister.
It's
that
new
job,
isn't
it?
Yeah,
well,
I
need
that
new
job.
I
can't
take
care
of
Amy
and
the
kids
I'm
not
gonna
sleep
on
your
couch
Okay,
well,
maybe
you
get
a
daytime
job,
It's
not
that
simple.
Well,
you
should
think
about
it.

Ben!
What
happened?
Just
leave
me
alone.
Angie,
get
out
of
here!
Now!
What
is
happening
to
you,
Ben?
Pull
yourself
together.






Help!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my...
No!

"Gary
Lewis."


Esseker.
Esseker.

Hello?
Hello?
Where
are
you?
I
want
to
help
you,
Damn
it!

I'm
coming!

Anybody
here?
Is
anybody
in
here?
Fuck
this
place.



MICHAEL:
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
-
Mom!
Mom!
Are
you
okay?
What's
happening?
Michael.
What's
the
matter,
sweetie?
-
There's
a
lady
screaming.
-
There,
in
the
mirror.
I
don't
see
anybody
-
You
just
had
a
nightmare,
sweetie.
Sometimes
they
can
feel
really
real,
-
Okay.
Come
on.
In
you
go.
I'm
right
around
the
corner,
all
right?
-
Love
you.
DAISY:
Can
you
leave
the
door
open?
-
But
you
go
back
to
sleep,
okay?
WOMAN
ON
TV:
The
42-year-old
is
expected
to
go
sexually
assaulting
a
former
co-worker
for
13
hours
on
Halloween
night
in
2005.
Braunstein's
lawyer
says
his
client
The
Feds
say
they'll
seek
the
death
accused
of
ordering
a
hit
on
a
rival.
The
trial
of
Vincent
"Vinny
Gorgeous"...

BEN:
I
swear
to
you,
I
couldn't
breathe.
It
was
like
a
nightmare,
but
I
was
awake.
-
You
think
I'm
crazy,
don't
you?
I
think
you're
just
going
through
You're
under
a
lot
of
stress.
You've
been
having
those
nightmares
-
You
know
it
wasn't
your
fault.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
in
the
department
store,
in
the
window
of
every
building
I
feel...
I
feel
like
I'm
not
the
one
but
they're
looking
back
at
me.
There's
no
one
looking
back
at
you
You're
obviously...
You're
still
conflicted
Maybe
you
need
to
talk
to
someone.
A
professional,
someone...
Mirrors
are
just
glass
and
silver,
Ben.
There's
nothing
behind
them.
Will
you
please
go
get
some
sleep,
okay?
I
love
you.

Coming!
Hold
on!
-
Mr.
Carson?
You
want
to
sign
here,
please?
-
You
have
a
good
day,
sir.
Holy
shit.
Lorenzo,
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
I
just
had
the
craziest
day
here.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Well,
you
know
Gary,
the
guy
Yeah.
Cops
found
him
dead
I
never
liked
him
too
much,
but,
Did
they
happen
to
tell
you
-
What?
No,
no,
they
wouldn't
tell
me.
Mrs.
Sapelli
is
waiting
for
me
at
home.
By
the
way,
They're
sending
someone
over
AMY:
We
have
a
white
male,
Following
the
completion
the
body
was
washed
and
lightly
dried.
A
Y-incision
was
made
to
the
xiphoid
process.
-
The
tissue
was
waterlogged...
Yes,
what
is
it?
There's
someone
in
the
lobby
for
you.
Ben.
What's
happening?
Thanks
for
seeing
me.
-
I'm
in
the
middle
of
work.
Yesterday
morning
you
picked
up
a
body.
Gary
Lewis.
-
Who
is
he?
at
the
Mayflower.
I
replaced
him.
How
do
you
have
his
driver's
license?
I
found
his
wallet
in
the
department
store.
Why
do
you
need
to
know
how
he
died?
Ben,
you've
been
suspended.
You're
not
Amy,
please,
just
listen
to
me.
There
are
some
very
strange
things
I
can't
explain,
but
it's...
This
guy
Gary
Lewis
sent
me
a
package
Thing
is,
I
never
met
him
before.
Inside
the
package
were
all
these
articles
It
was
like
he
was
trying
to
tell
me
I
need
to
figure
this
out.
Please.
Gary
Lewis,
Gary
Lewis.
There
he
is,
B-16.
He
slashed
his
throat.
There
you
go,
there's
your
answer.
And
you
get
a
lot
of
suicide
cases
I
didn't
think
so.
Excuse
me.
All
I
know
is,
That's
why
we
still
have
the
body.
What
did
he
use
to
cut
his
throat?
A
piece
of
mirror.
He
probably
broke
the
mirror
into
pieces
so
he'd
have
something

Seven
years
bad
luck.
Esseker.
Are
you
okay,
Ben?
I'm
fine.
I'm
sorry,
excuse
me.
I
need
to
see
his
file.
-
What?
-
Ben.
I
just
need
to
see
his
file.
Calm
down.
You're
not
even
and
now
you
want
to
Look,
I'll
be
off
then.
Amy,
you
know
where
to
find
me
Yeah.
Thanks,
Peter.
I
appreciate
it.
-
I
want
you
to
leave
now.
I'm
serious,
Ben.
I
can't
leave
here
until
I
see
that
file.
It's
important,
please.
Please.

Amy,
come
here
and
look
at
this
picture.
Look
at
the
piece
of
mirror
And
look
at
it
up
here
It's
full
of
blood.
Yet
in
reality,
it's
perfectly
clean.
So
what?
It's
probably
the
angle
What
are
you
trying
to
prove?
What
if
the
mirrors
are
showing
us
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
What
if
the
mirrors
are
reflecting
What
if
the
mirrors
can
actually
make
us
Like
making
Gary
Lewis
Ben,
listen
to
yourself.
Don't
you
want
to
get
reinstated?
Amy,
I'm
seeing
things
in
the
mirrors
to
the
point
where
I
can
feel
Ben,
you're
driving
me
fucking
crazy!
What's
wrong
with
you?
Do
you
think
I'm
making
this
up?
What
medication
are
you
taking

That's
a
strong
drug.
It
has
a
lot
of
serious
side
effects.
I'm
sorry
that
I
bothered
you.
You're
right.
Thanks
for
trying
to
help.







WOMAN:
night
at
this
bar.
-
LARRY:
All
right.
Where's
the
body?
WOMAN:
OFFICER:
And
there's
a
guy
been
living
with
her
OFFICER:
All
right.
WOMAN:
She
comes
home
late.
She
probably
closes
the
bar,
right?
Yeah.
'Cause
she
sleeps
during
the
day,
OFFICER:
All
right.


I
saw
blood
falling
I
want
you
to
ask
her,
BEN:
What's
going
on?
It's
all
right,
I
live
in
apartment
eight.
-
Just
tell
me
what's
going
on.
I
want
to
talk
to
the
lead
detective!
-
Who
is
the
lead
detective?
Larry,
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
-
Larry,
just
tell
me
what's
going
on.
Where's
Angie?
Where
the
fuck
is
my
sister?
-
I
can't
do
that,
Ben!



LARRY:
The
water
has
obliterated
No
sign
of
struggle
or
forced
entry.
And
the
front
door
was
locked,
the
person
who
did
this
or
it
was
someone
that
she
knew.
He
would've
never
laid
a
finger
on
her.
You
know,
when
their
father
died,

She
meant
the
world
to
him.
Listen,
so
far,
his
statement
is
pretty
We
checked
it
out.
And
the
downstairs
neighbors
said
they
began
to
notice
the
water
leakage
The
only
strange
thing,
is
that
Ben
told
the
daytime
that
he
was
planning
on
quitting
the
job.
Like
he
was
moving
away
someplace.
No.
Lately,
communication
hasn't
been
What
are
you
gonna
do
with
him?
I
figure
we'll
let
him
go.
AMY:
Larry.

I'm
so
sorry.
Ben?
Why
don't
you
come
home
I
can't.
I
don't
want
to
put
our
children
in
danger.
She
asked
me
to
quit,
but
I
wouldn't.
-
They
came
after
her.
I've
got
some
things
I
need
to
take
care
of.
-
Wait,
Ben.
Please.
I
don't
want
you
-
Please
stay
out
of
it.
Well,
in
that
case,
He'll
never
believe
me.
Neither
will
you.






What
do
you
want?
Please,
just
tell
me.
What
do
you
want
from
me?

What
do
you
want
from
me?


"Esseker."
Hey.
I
need
you
to
run
a
name
for
me.
Echo,
Sierra,
Sierra,
Echo,
-
LARRY
ON
PHONE:
Did
you
check
online?
Nothing.
IRS
and
DMV.
-
Where?
-
When?
Okay,
Ben.
Thanks.
"Mayflower
burns,
48
presumed
dead."
"Berry

"Woman,

"Mr.

brutally
killed
his

"Mirrors

-
Yeah.
What
did
you
get?
Look,
I
didn't
find
anything
Shit!
Shit.
Do
you
want
me
No.
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
I
want
you
to
run
another
name
for
me.
Terrence
Berry.
Wait
one
sec.
-
I
think
I
got
him.
You
still
there?
-
Your
guy
murdered
his
whole
family.
He's
dead.

Damn
it.
Can
you
tell
me
where
he
was
committed
DR.
MORRIS:
You
know,
Mr.
Carson,
when
as
a
completely
separate
being,
one
is
suddenly
confronted
two
entirely
separate
worlds
A
feeling
of
self-hatred,
can
split
the
personality
in
two.
Hence
creating
two
or
more
personalities
and
distinct
behavior
patterns
The
patient
then
has
of
two
distinct
worlds,
the
real
world
These
recordings
were
used
You'll
see
they
speak
for
themselves.
DOCTOR:
Why
did
you
set
In
order
to
destroy
the
mirrors.
Only
fire
can
destroy
mirrors,
DOCTOR:
had
to
destroy
those
mirrors,
Terrence?
They
killed
my
Helen
DOCTOR:
For
what
reason?
Why
would
mirrors
-
Because
I
didn't...
They
asked
me
to
find
Esseker.
Oh,
my
God.
We
all
are
looking
for
Esseker.
Amy.
Excuse
me,
I
have
to
go.
DOCTOR:
Tell
me
about
Esseker,
Terrence.
I
don't
know
who
Esseker
is!
I
don't
know
who
Esseker
is!
I
don't
know.
ROSA:
Mrs.
Carson?
It's
Rosa.

Mr.
Ben
is
here.
-
Hey.
How
was
school
today?
Good.
I'll
be
right
back.
Dad...
BEN:
Sweetheart,
just
give
me
a
second.
Daddy,
what
are
you
doing?
Honey,
don't
look
scared.
I
think
it
looks
nicer
like
this.
Don't
you?
AMY:
Rosa,
what's
happening?
Take
the
kids
downstairs,
right
now.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Amy,
you're
gonna
have
to
trust
me.
Get
out
of
the
house,
right
now!
Hey,
are
you
listening
to
me?
If
you
don't
leave
immediately,
and
I
warn
you,
Amy,
I
am
not
crazy.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
just
the
ones
I
realized
they
can
get
at
you
anywhere.
I
promise
I
will
leave
the
house.
What's
wrong
with
you?
I
know
what
you've
been
going
through
But
guess
what?
Angela
was
a
part
of
our
lives,
too,
It's
not
fair
what
you're
doing
to
us,
Ben!
Michael...
He's
