Don't

us
that.!
What's
her

She
doesn't

She's

Will
she

Gentlemen,
we
should
all

and
not

agitated.

Right.
All
right.
-
All
right.
-
There
ain't

What's
that?
It's
just
a
little
cocktail
of
my
own
mix.

My
name
is
Clemens.

It's

of

grieves
me
to
say.
Do
you

This
is

I
really
ought
to

I'm...
sorry.

Where
is
she?
I
have
to
see
her.
I
have
to
see
what's
left
of
her.
Is
there
any
particular
reason
that
Yes.
I
have
to
be
sure
how
she
died.
I
hate
to
be
repetitious
about
such
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
Was
she
your
daughter?
No.
She
wasn't.
Um...
could
I
have
a
moment
Yes,
of
course.


What's
she
doing?
Okay?
No.
We
have
to
do
an
autopsy.
-
What?
we
have
to
make
sure
And
I
told
you,
she
drowned.
I'm
not
so
sure.
You're
disorientated.
I
have

kind
exactly?

Mr.
Clemens?
That's
right,
sir.

Well,
first...
the

feeling

Second,
in
the

I
am

Well,
there

But
it's
turned
out
all
right.
-
There's
no
sign
of

in
the

But
it
might
be
helpful
if
Lt.
Ripley
didn't

I
am
told
she
did
in

It
might
also
be
helpful...
if
you

would
that
be

We
have

say
to

Anything
I
could

to

Then
I'd
give
her
the

And
I'd
give

She'd
soon
get

Frank.
What's
this?

"have
gone

"They
are

"and

Ashes

Why
are
the
innocent
punished?
Why
the
sacrifice?
Why
the
pain?
There
aren't
any
promises.
Nothing's
certain.
Only
that
some
get
called,
She
won't
ever
know
-
for
those
of
us
left
behind.
We
commit
these
bodies
with
a
glad
heart.

For
within
each
seed...
there
is
a
promise
of
a
flower.

And
within
each
death...
no
matter
how
small...
there's

a

A
new

Amen.



I'll
tell
you,

What
trouble
can
she
become?
She's
already
changed
everything.


What
the
fuck
are
we
supposed
to...

-
I
mean
it.

Okay.
There's
a
lot
of
talk
going
around
that
Any
you
guys
want
to
tell
me

Come
on.
All
right.
I'll
tell
ya.
I
don't

I
don't

around

I
don't

That
the
way
you
feel
about
it?
Yeah.
The
guy's
crazy

You
got
anything
to
say
for
yourself?
Well,
he's
going
with
you.

Really?
Well,
I

You
have
any
faith,
sister?
Well,
we've
got
a
lot
of
faith
here.
I
thought
women
weren't
allowed.
Well,
we've
never
had
any
before...
but
we
tolerate
anybody.
-
Even
the
intolerable.
That's
just
a
statement
of
principle.
You
see,
we've
got
And
until
now,
no
temptation.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Huh!
We're
waiting
for
God
to
return...
and
raise
his
servants
to
redemption.

the
rest

it
were,

you?
-
Hardly.
Some
sort
of

Right.
Point
is,
when
the

wanted

I've

you...
on
the
humdrum
history
can
you
not
tell
me
what
You
attracted
to
me?
In
what
way?
In
that
way.
Very
direct.
I've
been
out
here
a
long
time.
So
have
I.
Yech!
Hey,
Spike.
Are
you
down
there?

I
really
appreciate
your

but
I
am
aware
that
they...
In
the
nicest
possible
way,
of
course.

I
have
a
job
to
do.
Hmm.
I
just
want
to
know
why

Possibly.

And

What's

I'm
on

I

I
loved

Is
it

Hi,

My

Fire

What
started
the

Bishop?
Can
you
hear
me?
The
fire
was
electrical.
It
was
in
the

Did
the

moving
It's

dark
here,
Ripley.
Just
tell
me.
Does

Was
there

Yes.
Is
it
on

did
it
It

Does
the

The

they

Do
me

rather

nothing.
You're
sure?
Do

It

I
didn't

It

It

yourself
together.
-
Now,
where
are
Boggs
and
Rains?

Hopeless.
You're
not
gonna
-
It
wasn't
me.
I'm
afraid
we'll
have
to
assume
this
simple
bastard
has
murdered
them.
Now,
you
don't
know
that.
He's
never
lied
to
me.
He's
crazy,
he's
a
fool,
He's
telling
the
truth.
I'd
like
to
talk
to
him
-
It
was
a
dragon.
I'm
not
interested
in
your
opinion...
because
you
are
not
This
man
is
a
convicted
multiple
murderer,
Isn't
that
right,
Mr.
Dillon?
Yeah.
That
part's
right.
Then
I'll
talk
to
you.
It's
important.
When
I
have
finished
I
will
be
quite
pleased

Let
me
see
if
I
have
It's
an
eight-foot
creature
of
some
kind,
and
it
arrived
on
your
spaceship.
It
kills
on
sight
And,
of
course,
you
expect
me
to
accept
No,
I
don't
expect
anything.
-
Quite
a
story,
Mr.
Aaron.
-
Never
heard
anything
quite
like
it,
sir.
Tell
me,
Lieutenant,
Well,
what
kind
This
is
a
prison.
It's
not
a
good
idea
to
allow
prisoners
What
keeps
them
from
killing
you?
Fear.
There's
no
way
to
escape.
With
the
arrival
of
the
next
supply
ship,
This
is
a
maximum
security
prison...
and
you
have
no
weapons
of
any
kind?
We
have
some
carving
knives
in
the
abattoir.
Some
fire
axes
scattered
about
the
place.
That's
all?
We're
on
the
honor
system.
-
Then
we're
fucked.
Confined
to
the
infirmary.
Mr.
Aaron
will
escort
you.
I
think
you'll
be
safe
from
any
large,
Yes,
that's
a
good
girl.
-

Superintendent
Andrews
wants
a
meeting.
Isn't
there
any
way
off
of
this
place?

No.
Supply
ship
comes
-
And
that's
it?
Fuck.
They
are
sending
somebody
Really.

I
don't
know.
Nobody's
ever
been
Do
you
want
to
tell
me
No.
-
You'll
just
say
I'm
crazy.
-
That's
a
bit
uncharitable.
How
are
you
feeling?

Not
so
hot.
Sore
throat.
Sick
to
my
stomach.
Well,
that's
understandable
Perhaps
I
should
give
you

I
don't
know
why
everybody
Nobody's
perfect,
only
human.
There's
no
such
thing
In
an
insane
world...
a
sane
man...
must...
appear...
insane.
That's
very
profound,
Golic.
You
married?
-
Me?
Pretty
girl.
I
used
to
know
They
used
to
like
me.
For
a
while.
You're
gonna
die
too.
-
Are
you?
Married.

Why?
-
Just
curious.
-
How
about
leveling
with
me?
When
I
asked
how
you
got
assigned
here,
And
then
when
I
asked
about
the
prison
you
ducked
me
again.
It's
a
long,
sad
story...
and
more
than
Try
me.
-

After
my
student
years...
despite
the
fact
that
I
had
become...
secretly
addicted
to
morphine...
I
was
considered
a
man
with
a
future.
And
during
my
first
residency,
So,
I
went
out
and
I
got
Then
I
got
called
back.
Boiler
had
blown
on
a
fuel
plant...
and
there
were
30
casualties.
And
11
of
them
died.
Not
as
a
result
of
the
accident...
but
because
I
prescribed
I
got
seven
years
in
prison
At
least
I
got
off
the
morphine.
I'm
sorry.
I
think
I
was
let
off
lightly.
Did
you
serve
your
time
here?
I
got
to
know
So
when
they
stayed,
I
stayed.
Nobody
else
would
employ
me.
So,
do
you
still
trust
me
with
a
needle?

Magnificent.

Give
us
strength,
We
recognize
we
are
poor
sinners
Let
the
circle
be
unbroken
-

Amen.
What
the
fuck
is
this
We
got
murder.
We
got
rape.
I
don't
want
no
more
bullshit
Now,
we
got
problems,
Yes.
Thank
you,
Mr.
Dillon.
All
right.
Once
again,
this
is
rumor
control.
Here
are
the
facts.
At
0800
hours,
through
carelessness
on
his
part...
was
found
dead
in
vent
shaft
17.
He
seems
to
have
been

At
about
2100
hours...
prisoner
Golic
reappeared
Prisoners
Boggs
and
Rains
are
missing.
There
seems
to
be
a
good
chance
that
-
at
the
hands
of
prisoner
Golic.
We
need
to
organize
Volunteers
will
be
appreciated.

I
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
has
suddenly
developed
I
can
only
hope
we
are
able
to
all
until
the
rescue
team
arrives
It's
here!
It
got
Clemens!
-
Stop
this
raving
at
once!
Stop
it!
Aaron,
get
that
foolish
woman
-


Out
of
my
way.!
Fuck!

Your
wrath
has
come,
and
the
time
The
apocalypse
is
upon
us.
Let
us
be
ready.
-
That
thing
was
massive.
-
I
saw
it.
What
the
fuck
do
we
do
now?
Organize.
We
got
Right.
Well,
I
guess
-
85's
gonna
be
in
charge.

Okay,
look.
There's
no
way
He
was
a
good
man.
I
know
you
guys
Aaron,
we
don't
want
Hey,
sister,
what
about
you?
How
about
showing
us
Forget
fucking
Shirley
Temple.
-
Right.
No
fuckin'
way.
I
just
take
care
of
my
own.

Well,
what
does
Is
this
mother
-
Yeah.
-
So
how
are
we
gonna
stop
it?
-
We
have
no
weapons.
Is
that
correct?
I
haven't
seen
one
Moves
differently.
But
the
others
Not
much
else.
-
Can
we
seal
off
this
area?
The
installation's
10
miles
square.
-
There's
600
air
ducts
I
see
these
closed-circuit
monitors
The
video
system
hasn't
worked
in
years.
We've
got
a
lot
of
technology,
-
What
85
is
trying
to
tell
you
is...
we
ain't
got
no
entertainment
center,
no
video
system,
no
freezers,
no
fucking
ice
cream...
no
rubbers,
no
women,
no
guns.
All
we
got
here
is
shit!
Oh,
what
the
hell
are
we
She's
the
one
Why
don't
we
just
get
her
head
Sounds
good
to
me.

Why
don't
you
shut
the
fuck
up?
Hmm.
Right.
Right.
What
are
we
going
to
do?
-
What's
this?
that
leads
from
the
mess
hall
It's
a
ventilation
shaft.
Then
we
go
in
there,
flush
it
out.
Hey.
Hey,
look,
there's
miles
and
miles
It
won't
go
far.
It'll
nest
in
this
area.
Right
around...
-
here.
It's
like
a
lion.
It
sticks
close
to
the
zebras.
Zebras?
Oh,
right.
But,
look.
Running
around
down
here
Once
you
get
out
of
this
main
shaft,
-
Don't
we
have
flashlights?
-
I
told
you,
nothing
works.
Do
we
have
the
capacity
Most
humans
have
enjoyed
that
privilege
No
need
to
be
sarcastic.
Never
been
used.
They
were
gonna
Never
got
around
to
it.
This
the
only
way
in
or
out?
That's
right.
Walls
are
Really
knew
how
You're
saying
we
get
there's
no
way
it
can
get
out?
That's
right.
No
fucking
way.

This
is
where
we
keep
it.
-
Quinitricetyline.
Right.
I've
got
to
get
these
section
for
the
paintbrush,
uh...
-
So,
um...
-
Yeah.
You
can
get
And,
uh,
don't
call
me
that.
What's
this
"85"
thing?
A
couple
of
us
sneaked
a
look
at
It's
his
I.Q.
I
saw
a
drum
of
this
stuff...
fall
into
a
beachhead
bunker
once.
The
blast
put
a
tug
Great
stuff!
All
right.
Let
me
get
this
straight.
You
want
to
burn
it
down
force
it
in
here,
slam
the
door...
-
and
trap
its
ass?
And
you
want
help
You
got
something
better
to
do?
Why
should
we
put
our
ass
Your
ass
is
already
on
the
line.
The
only
question
is...
what
are
you
gonna
do
about
it?

Look
at
this.
There's
only
one
of
these
fucking
batteries
-
Hey,
it
could
have
been
a
lot
worse.
We
might
have
got
