NARRATOR:
Long
ago,
a
mythic
played
out
in
ancient
China.
The
country
was
torn
by
civil
war,
with
many
kingdoms
But
one
king
had
a
ruthless
ambition


Leave
me.
Prepare
for
war!
NARRATOR:
The
other
rulers
hired
assassins
before
he
could
conquer
them
all.



Stop!
I
am
not
harmed.
We
attack
tonight!

NARRATOR:
Kingdom
by
kingdom,
and
anyone
who
resisted
met
a
terrible
fate.
The
country
was
his.
He
was
now
Emperor
of
All
Under
Heaven.
He
enslaved
his
conquered
enemies
When
they
were
dead
or
useless,
The
Emperor's
mystics
taught
him
fire,
water,
earth,
wood
and
metal.
His
power
seemed
without
limit.
He
was
master
of
millions,
but
like
the
lowliest
peasant,

I
have
too
much
to
do
for
one
lifetime.
NARRATOR:
He
needed
to
defeat
One
day,
news
came
of
a
powerful
witch
who
was
rumoured
to
know
He
ordered
General
Ming,
his
oldest
friend
The
witch
was
named
Zi
Yuan,
and
she
was
nothing

Your
Majesty...
Rise
up.
I
do
not
possess
the
secret
of
...but
I
know
where
to
find
it.
General...
No
man
is
to
touch
her.
She
is
mine.
NARRATOR:
On
the
western
border
There
was
housed
the
greatest
library
and
Zi
Yuan
was
sure

This
is
a
key.
NARRATOR:
It
was
the
long
lost
a
collection
of
all
the
mystical
secrets
The
Emperor's
answer
was
here

You
have
served
me
well.
I
will
grant
you
anything
you
desire.
I
want
to
spend
my
life
with
General
Ming.
Of
course.
Read.

NARRATOR:
She
cast
the
spell
in
Sanskrit,
an
ancient
language

I
feel
your
spell
working.
I
am
now
immortal.
Come,
I
want
to
show
you
something.

Become
my
queen
and
I
will
let
him
live.
Do
what
he
says!
Save
yourself!
You
will
never
keep
your
word.
You
are
right.


Now,
join
General
Ming
in
hell.

What
did
you
do
to
me?
I
cursed
you
and
your
army.

Surround
the
Palace!
The
Emperor
is
in
trouble!
NARRATOR:
The
curse
must
never
be
lifted,
or
the
Emperor
will
rise
again
On
that
dark
day,
You
can
run,
but
you
can't
hide.
One
o'clock.
OXFORDSHIRE,
ENGLAND
Ten
o'clock,
one
o'clock.
Ten
o'clock,
one...
And
this
is
something
for
grown
men
to
do?


Come
on.

Bite
on
this.
Evy,
I'm
home!
Mrs
O'Connell
is
at
her
book
reading,
sir.
Oh,
right.
Well,
that's
great,
You
didn't
think
I'd
catch
anything,
I
had
the
utmost
confidence,
sir.
JAMESON:
There's
a
hook
in
your
neck,
sir.
RICK:
Fall
back!
Follow
me!
EVELYN:
"Now
safely
aboard
the
airship
LONDON
"Dash
swept
Scarlet
into
his
arms.
"'Oh,
God,
Scarlet,
I
thought
I'd
lost
you.'
"Bathed
in
rays
of
golden
sunlight,
"our
heroes
sealed
their
reunion
"their
love
deeper
and
truer
than
ever."
Mrs
O'Connell,
we're
all
dying
to
know,
is
the
Scarlet
O'Keefe
character
Honestly,
I
can
say
-
Any
more
questions?
Mrs
O'Connell,
is
your
life
today

I
wish
my
life
were
that
exciting
now.
MAN:
Will
there
be
another
book
WOMAN
2:
Do
you
believe
in
happy
endings?

Isn't
this
blissful?
Dinner
at
home.
-
Every
night.
-
Here's
to
retirement.

Still
no
letter
from
Alex.
Yeah,
well,
what
do
you
expect?
The
only
time
we
ever
hear
from
that
kid
is
when
he's
getting
kicked
out
of
college
I'm
sure
he's
just
buried
in
his
studies.
-
So,
how
did
your
book
reading
go?
Until
they
asked
me,
"When
will
there
Yeah,
but
you
did
promise
the
publisher
I
know.
But
I
spend
my
nights
staring
We
could
skip
dinner,
and
I
could
attempt
to
inspire
you
upstairs.
Oh,
that's
so
sweet
of
you,
darling.
But
I'm
going
to
sit
at
that
typewriter
Thank
you.

Trout.
How
lovely!

I'm
so
happy
you
found
a
hobby

NINGXIA
PROVINCE,
CHINA

Don't
worry,
we'll
find
the
entrance
today.
Li
Tung,
what's
for
lunch?
Noodle
soup.
Very
good.
ALEX:
Good.
Wilson's
back.
You're
a
couple
days
late,
Professor.
I
was
beginning
to
think
Oh,
my
dear
fellow,
-
Are
you
thirsty?
-
Here
you
go.
You
know,
I
thought
I
was
looking
at
your
father.
You
really
are
Rick
O'Connell's
son.
Yeah,
well,
hopefully
after
today,
What
a
powerful
face!
When
I
told
my
colleagues
at
the
museum
they
were
thrilled.
-
Yes,
however...
When
am
I
gonna
get
in
that
tomb?
Don't
let
the
buggers
get
you
down.
It
was
you
that
discovered
and
with
it,
you'll
discover
the
Emperor.
-
I
have
complete
faith
in
you,
Alex.
Thanks
for
believing
in
me.

We
found
it!
We
found
the
door!
Bad
Mummy.
Yeah.
Vile
Mummy?

No.
Cursed
Mummy!
Mysterious
Mummy.
Malignant
Mummy.
Prepare
to
die!
Take
that!
Rick!
Darling,
where
are
you?
I'm
ready
to
be
inspired.
Do
you
remember
the
time
And
you
came
to
save
me
and
you
cut...
No!
You
tore
open
the
ropes
just
as
he
was
about
to
plunge
his...

Oh,
rats.

Watch
out!
-
Emperor
didn't
want
any
houseguests.

Stay
together.
Sir
Colin
Bembridge.
Oh,
gee...
He
went
searching
for
this
tomb
They
left
him
like
this
as
a
warning.
Unfortunately,
this
is
not
the
dead
man
Let's
keep
moving.
Look
at
it,
Alex.
Look
at
it!

Chu
Wah!



-
Chu
Wah.
Alex,
Alex,
they're
dead!
Come
on.
This
kind
of
danger
goes
with
the
territory.
Alex!
-
Yes?
-
Yes?
All
right,
good
chap.
Okay.
Good
chap.
All
the
warriors
are
facing
in
to
this
point,
-
as
if
awaiting
an
order
from
the
Emperor.
Listen,
you
don't
think
some
bloody
grave
No,
he's
still
here.
You
see,
this
is
a
feng
shui
compass.
Okay.
Now.
This...
Okay,
this
is
true
north,
but
the
feng
shui
compass
-
All
right,
we
need
to
realign
it.
-
All
right,
here
we
go.


Alex!
Alex,
speak
to
me!
Are
you
all
right?
-
Alex!
Tell
me,
have
we
found
the
Emperor?
Alex!
What
is
it?
It's
only
the
greatest
find
since
King
Tut!
"If
he
is
awakened,
It's
definitely
him!

Even
had
his
concubines
buried
alive
Selfish
bastard.
Hey,
Professor
Wilson,
Or
are
you
so
overwhelmed
you
can't
talk?


Wilson!

Let's
go,
Professor.
WILSON:
All
right.
FRY:
First
of
all,
I'd
just
like
to
say
that
the
Foreign
Office
appreciates
But
I've
been
sent
to
offer
you
I'm
afraid
we've
retired
Yeah,
we've...
We
don't
do
that
any
more.
-
EVELYN:
Not
at
all.
But
just
out
of
curiosity,
We
need
you
to
courier
this
to
Shanghai.

-
Nice
piece
of
ice.
If
you
believe
the
legend,
It
was
smuggled
out
of
China
in
1940.
Now,
the
government
would
like
as
a
sign
of
good
faith
And
with
your
expertise
in
the
field,
Oh,
we'd
be
so
flattered.
But
Rick
and
I,
we
made
a
promise
that
we
would
settle
down.
-
That's
right,
yeah,
we
did,
didn't
we?
We...
Well,
I
must
admit
I
am
a
little
disappointed.
Postwar
China
is
very
dangerous.
There
are
a
lot
of
factions
that
would
love
In
lesser
hands,
We
couldn't
let
that
happen,
could
we?
No,
that
could
be
bad
for
the
world.
-
The
world...
Terrible.
You
know,
she
has
a
brother
-
Jonathan!
He
owns
a
nightclub,
if
I'm
not
mistaken.
We
have
been
meaning
to
visit.
We
could...
-
We
should...
-
Say
hello.
Does
this
mean
Yes.
SHANGHAI,
CHINA
CHINESE
NEW
YEAR,
1947



There
we
are.
Here's
to
you,
Princess.
And
Imhotep.

Ding-dong.
Hi,
can
you
buy
a
drink
for
me?
Excuse
me.
Alex!
Alex!
You're
back
again.
Come
here,
Alex.
Let
me
get
you
a
drink.
Smooth
special
for
the
pup,
huh?

Make
that
two.
Sorry,
Uncle
Jon,
but
I
got
a
better
offer.
JONATHAN:
No,
no,
Alex.
No,
look.
To
put
it
in
archaeological
terms,
that's
a
tomb
Now,
listen,
listen,
Your
discovery
will
go
public
in
a
few
days,
They're
not
gonna
be
happy
Will
you
relax,
Uncle
Jon?
Okay?
I'm
here.
-
Alex...
I
have
some
excavation
to
do.
Jonathan!

You're
in
China!
Evy.
Rick.

What
are
you...
It's
so...
Brother,
how
lovely
to
see
you.
I
had
no
idea
he
was
here!
-
Who
was
here?

MAN:
This
happens
every
time!
Every
man
in
the
bar!
-
Dad?
MAN:
I
don't
know
what
to
do
with
you!
-
I
can't
leave
the
room
for
10
minutes!
-
MAN:
I'm
sick
of
it!
I'm
gonna
kill
you,
kid!
Not
so
fast,
that's
my
kid.
-
Mad
Dog
Maguire?
-
Hey,
hey.
-
Alex!
Sweetheart!
Are
you
all
right?
Come
on,
How
long
has
it
been?
Egypt,
'23.
French
Foreign
Legion.
This
guy
could
land
a
plane
-
Why
are
you
here?
Now,
son
or
no
son,
-
Get
out
of
the
way,
Dad.
Now
as
much
as
I'd
really
like
you
His
mother
would
be
upset!
Very
upset.
You
have
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do,
I
got
a
wife
now,
and
a
kid.
Things
are
a
little
bit
different,
-
Yeah.
We're
just
surprised
to
see
you
here.
JONATHAN:
Who's
gonna
pay
All
right?
I'm
not
here
five
minutes,
and
I'm
already
pulling
your
fanny
You're
going
back
to
college.
How'd
you
think
this
was
gonna
work,
Dad?
No.
But
we
should
sit
down
No
offence,
Mom,
Hey,
don't
you
turn
your
back
on
me.
Alex!
Alex,
just...
Alex,
come
here.
Can
you...
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.

-
It's
all
your
fault!
You're
the
one
You
couldn't
leave
him
alone
Perhaps
I
was
overcompensating
for
the
fact
His
life
was
my
top
priority.
How
many
times
did
I
save
that
kid
A
little
warmth
and
encouragement
I'm
his
father.
It's
implied.
We've
spent
our
entire
lives
and
the
one
thing
we've
lost.
We
can't
let
Alex
become
some
stranger
-
We
can't
let
that
happen.
How
are
we
gonna
fix
this?
We
need
to
do
it
together.
PARAMILITARY
OUTPOST


The
O'Connells
are
in
Shanghai.
Do
they
have
the
Eye
of
Shangri-La?
Our
spy
says
they
do.
Good.
Assemble
the
troops!
Yes
sir.
Soldiers!
Soon
all
our
training
and
sacrifice...
will
bear
great
fruit.
It
is
my
dream
to
raise
our
Emperor
Only
He
can
bring
order
out
of
this
chaos.
Soldiers...
tonight
our
great
battle
begins!


You
know,
this
might
have
been
faster
It's
Chinese
New
Year.
Don't
you
just
love
this
country?
They
have
so
many
extra
little
holidays,
I
can't
believe
It's
so
exciting.
Well,
after
last
night,
JONATHAN:
Listen,
EVELYN:
You're
not
coming?
JONATHAN:
No,
no,
There
he
is.
Oh,
my
darling,
very
impressive.
When
do
you
get
to
open
the
sarcophagus?
ALEX:
Well,
Do
the
words
"rest
in
peace"
So,
Mom,
why
don't
you
stick
around
and
we
can
open
it
together?
I
would
like
that
very
much,
thanks.
Alex,
why
don't
you
go
that
we're
here.
You
know...
No
problem.
Great.
Just
don't
wake
the
big
guy
up
Hey,
Alex.
You
know,
this
is
all
really,
really
big
stuff.
Whatever
you
say,
Dad.

What?
You
just
have
a
certain
glow
about
you
I
guess
mummies
bring
out
the
best
in
me.
Take
a
wrong
turn
at
Cairo?
-
Roger.
Rick.
You
know,
when
Alex
told
me
I
just
couldn't
believe
my
ears.
Well,
now
I
just
pillage
tombs
-
Congratulations
on
your
latest
discovery.
He's
one
hell
of
a
kid.
And
he's
the
only
one
we've
got,
so
the
next
time
you
send
him
you
give
us
the
heads-up
first.
Yes,
yes,
of
course.
And
now,
I
believe
you
have
What's
that?
Oh,
you
mean
this?


I'm
sorry...
There,
go
ahead.
All
yours,
Rog.
I
knew
I
could
rely
on
you
two.
I'm
afraid
your
work
is
not
done
yet,
I'd
like
to
introduce
you
to
a
friend
of
mine.
Roger!
Well,
he
is
the
man
who
financed
Alex's
dig.
Cheek
by
jowl.
General.
Search
him.
No.
The
Eye
belongs
to
the
Chinese
people.
So,
Rog,
you
snake,
how
much
did...
Is
it
Yin
and
Yang?
...pay
you?
Enough
to
pull
strings
at
the
Foreign
Office,
make
sure
that
it
was
you
two
The
Eye
contains
the
elixir
I
need
you
to
open
it,
Mrs
O'Connell.
No.
You're
going
to
use
it
to
wake
the
Emperor,
And
his
Terracotta
Army.
Raising
an
army
of
mummies
is
insane.

Easy!
Go
easy.
Time
to
open
the
sarcophagus.
Move!
Read
the
inscription!
Now!
Ancient
Chinese
isn't
my
forte.
Here's
some
encouragement.
Wilson!
I'll
do
it!
No,
Evy,
don't
do
it!
The
inscription
says
from
a
person
of
pure
heart
Your
husband
was
right.
No!
Only
the
pure
of
heart
would
sacrifice
Open
it.
You
never
called
after
our
last
date.
I
don't
have
time
for
games,
Alex.
You
know
my
name,
but
I
don't
know
yours.
It's
Lin.
You
want
to
explain
to
me
We
could
do
that.
Or
we
could
save
your
parents.
Wilson,
you
son
of
a
bitch!

-
Get
on
with
it,
O'Connell.

Once
this
touches
him,
Finish
him
off.


Alex,
please!
Don't.
That's...
Don't,
don't.
Don't,
please.
No,
don't,
Alex,
it's
me.
Please.
It's
not
him.
This
is
a
eunuch!
It's
a
decoy!
Where
the
hell's
the
Emperor?

Stay!

Here
we
go
again.

I
live
to
serve
you,
my
Lord.
I
can
help
you
become
immortal.
If
you
are
lying,
you
will
burn.
Wait!
Wait!
You
wait
for
me!

Watch
out!
RICK:
We
got
to
put
this
mummy
down
fast!
Open
the
gate!
Open
the
gate!

Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
I
know.
Sorry,
pal.
-
You
wanna
drive?
God,
I
love
a
woman
who
can
drive
a
truck.
Hey,
pal,
I'm
really
sorry,
Hit
it,
honey!
No!
Move
over!
What?
No!
No!

No!
-
What?
Sorry
about
the
Rolls!
You
guys
are
like
mummy
magnets!
-
We
have
to
turn
you
around!
Excuse
me.
-
Hey,
we
could
use
this!
-
Oh,
yeah,
that's
a
better
idea.
Stop
mucking
about!
They're
getting
away!

Just
drive!
RICK:
Aim
for
the
Emperor!
-
Light
it
up,
Jonathan!
Fire!


Did
we
get
him?
-
Fire!
-
Your
ass
is
on
fire!
-
Hold
still!
-
Well,
spank
my...
-
Put
me
out,
Rick!
Spank
my
ass!
Spank
my
ass!
All
right,
here
I
come!
LIN:
Give
me
your
hand!
Come
on!
Watch
out!
RICK:
Evy,
where
are
you
going?
-
Taking
a
short
cut!

-
I
told
you
it
was
a
short
cut!
Now
he's
chasing
us!


Hurry!
Give
me
your
hand.
-
Don't
wait
up
for
me.
Out!
-
Where's
Rick?
Damn
it!
You're
mine!

-
Give
me
your
hand
and
get
on
this
horse!
Alexander
Rupert
O'Connell,
you
get

Get
out
of
the
way!
Get
out
of
the
way!

JONATHAN:
Evy!
We've
got
to
go
back
and
help
Rick!
JONATHAN:
Rick!
Forget
Rick!
I'll
go
after
the
Emperor.
Trust
me.
I've
got
a
little
more
experience
And
I
have
the
only
weapon
Okay.
I'll
cover
you.
Let's
go!
ALEX:
Lin!

-
I
thought
you
were
dead!

LIN:
Look
out!

-
Thanks,
Rick.
Could
you
get
the
cab?
You
know,
I
would
have
killed
the
Emperor
I
had
everything
under
control.
Oh,
yeah,
that's
exactly
Yeah,
well,
good
going,
And
this
bugger's
got
superpowers.
ALEX:
He's
got
control
over
fire,
water,
And
you
dug
him
up
anyway.
Yeah,
well,
you're
not
gonna
-
RICK:
Am
I?
No
one's
to
blame
here.
Yeah,
that's
true.
I
apologise
for
my
parents.
But
I
thought
we
worked
Except
we
failed.
I'm
sorry,
-
Who
are
you
exactly?
My
family
has
watched
The
Emperor
cannot
be
killed
unless
My
mother
put
a
curse
on
it
long
ago.
Mmm-hmm.
Well,
a
quick
family
meeting,
Alex.
-
Sit.
What
do
you
really
know
about
this
girl?
Well,
not
much,
but
after
her
help
tonight,
-
Faith.
You
don't
really
believe
in
the
concept
If
the
Emperor
reaches
Shangri-La
he
will
raise
his
army
Much
as
I'd
like
to
stay
Shangri-La
is
a
crock.
Yeah,
but
that's
what
you
used
to
say
-
You
did
pretty
well
off
it.
The
Gateway
to
Shangri-La
lies
in
Beyond
it
is
a
golden
tower.
Once
the
diamond
is
placed
at
the
top,
Yang
still
has
the
diamond,
and
that's
where
She's
right.
All
the
legends
of
the
Eye
I
like
her,
Alex.
She
knows
what's
what.
Now,
just
say
that
we
were
to
believe
you,
Yes.
I
have
been
there
once.
Himalayas.
We're
going
to
need
a
plane.
Well,
I
know
just
the
Mad
Dog
for
the
job.
MAGUIRE:
Well,
any
self-respecting
pilot
but
I
don't
have
any
self-respect,
so
I'll
put
you
down
That
should
give
us
a
good
advantage.
MAGUIRE:
Of
course,
Great!
I'd
tell
you
to
fasten
your
seatbelts,

-
Why
am
I
laughing?
RICK:
Mad
Dog,
Mad
Dog!
JONATHAN:
Oh,
God!

JONATHAN:
Maguire!
Come
on,
man!
Mad
Dog!

RICK:
Brake!
No,
no!
Nobody
move.
Nobody
move,
nobody
move!
What
is
that
God-awful
smell?
The
yak
yakked.

Welcome
to
the
modern
world,
my
Lord.
Why
did
you
raise
me?
I
love
this
land.
What
is
in
it
for
you?
I
want
to
serve
as
your
general.
The
last
general
I
trusted...
betrayed
me.
I
will
not
make
that
mistake.
I
cannot
escape
this
curse
General.
I
understand,
my
Lord.
We
need
to
find
the
Pool
of
Eternal
Life.
This
will
point
the
way.


come
to
court
your
sister
Kate
You
know
very
well
he
owns
the
farm

MAGUIRE
OVER
RADIO:
Delta-Tango-Alpha
Delta-Tango-Alpha,
this
is
Ricochet.
Yeah,
you
know
that
Yang
fellow
He's
just
shown
up.
Ricochet
out.
Thanks,
Mad
Dog.
That's
us,
people!
Let's
go!
-
Jonathan,
wake
up!
Hold
the
line!
Good,
we're
a
little
more
than
halfway.
We're
gonna...
ALEX:
Lin
says
if
we
leave
at
first
light,
Did
she
happen
to
mention
how
she
knows
No,
not
really.
Kind
of
mysterious.
She's
certainly
managed
to
enchant
you.
Come
on,
Alex.
You
obviously
like
her.
Mom,
the
thin
mountain
air,
Whatever
secret
she's
hiding,
I
just
don't
want
to
see
you
get
hurt.
I
appreciate
that,
but,
you
know,
I've
had
my
fair
share
of
experience
Really?
How
many
experiences
Well,
you
shouldn't
ask
questions
you
don't
Right.
Hey,
Mom.
I'm
sorry
I
blamed
you
guys
What's
so
funny?
My
mother
is
under
the
impression
I
hope
nothing
romantic.
Yeah,
well,
I
told
her
there
We're
complete
opposites,
You
guard
tombs.
I
raid
them.
Those
are
some
-
Absolutely.
Now
that
we've
cleared
that
up,
I
agree
totally.
Besides,
you're
not
my
type.
Of
course
not.
You
don't
like
a
woman

The
expression
is
"kick
my
ass."
And
for
the
record,
you
didn't.
Yeah,
it's
not
easy
being
me,
you
know.
Then
again,
I
don't
suppose
is
it,
Geraldine,
old
girl?
If
I'd
met
a
girl
like
you,
Geraldine...
You
know,
hard-working,
you're
a
little
bit
hairy,
but
I
don't
mind
that.
There
it
is!
We
found
it!
The
Gateway
of
Shangri-La!
JONATHAN:
Go,
girl!
Go!
You're
free!
Go,
Geraldine!
Live
free!
What
did
you
do
now?
Rob
an
armoury?
Have
you
ever
seen
a
Walther
P38?
Looks
pretty
anaemic
Well,
it's
not
about
size,
Dad.
You
want
power?
I
give
you
the
Thompson
submachine
gun.
-
Twenty-five
a
mag.
but
the
cocking
mechanism
always
jams.
Here.
Check
out
the
Russian
PPS
Now,
this
is
the
future
right
here.
You
know,
it's
experience
that
wins
the
day.
Boys!
If
I
may...
Do
we
have
a
plan
for
the
Emperor?
Yeah.
We're
gonna
hit
him
and
smash
him
like
a
Ming
vase.
-
And
if
that
doesn't
work?
Plan
B!
You
go
upstairs,
-
You
light
it
up.
We
blow
the
guy
sky
high!
-
You!
What?
So
if
the
explosion
doesn't
kill
us,
-
You
got
a
better
idea?
I
say
we
ambush
him
Long-range,
that's
a
better
idea.
Yeah,
we
can
get
in
close,
Dad.
-
JONATHAN:
Much
better
idea.
-
with
Lin's
dagger.
I
just
don't
put
much
faith
-
Okay,
Dad,
she
is
not
my
girlfriend.
-
but
I
still
don't
trust
her.
-
So
you
should
trust
my
judgement,
okay?
I've
put
down
more
mummies
You
put
down
one
mummy,
Dad.
Yeah.
Same
mummy
twice!
EVELYN:
Hand
me
the
green
wire,
Are
you
sure
you
know
what
you
are
doing?
Of
course.
I've
done
this
a
hundred
times.
If
the
Emperor
places
the
Eye
up
there,


Clear
a
path
to
the
Golden
Tower.
Prove
yourself
to
me.

Let's
give
a
warm
O'Connell
welcome!

Fire!


Bazooka!
RICK:
Fall
back!
Alex!
Follow
me!

We
gotta
take
out
those
bazookas!
Go!
Fall
back!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Time
to
go
to
plan
B!
Blow
up
the
tower!
Hey,
I'm
actually
a
little
bit
concerned
Couldn't
we
go
straight
to
plan
C?
Just
make
it
go
bang!
I'll
cover
you!
Come
on.
All
right,
let's
go,
go,
go!
Come
on.
Oh,
be
good.

Set
up
a
crossfire!
Move
it!
