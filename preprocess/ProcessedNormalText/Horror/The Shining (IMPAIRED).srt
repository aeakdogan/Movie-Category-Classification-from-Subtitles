Hi.
I've
got
an
appointment
My
name
is
Jack
Torrance.
His
office
is
the
first
door
Thank
you.

-Mr.
Ullman?
-I'm
Jack
Torrance.
-Very
nice
to
meet
you.
-This
is
my
secretary,
Susie.
-Susie,
how
do
you
do?
No
problem
at
all.
That's
very
good
time.
Sit
down
a
minute,
Jack.
Just
make
yourself
at
home.
Like
some
coffee?
If
you're
having
some,
-Susie.
And
ask
Bill
Watson
to
join
us.
Yes,
I
will.

Mom?
Yeah?
Do
you
really
want
to
go
and
live
Sure
I
do.
It'll
be
lots
of
fun.
Yeah.
I
guess
so.
Anyway,
there's
hardly
anybody
I
know.
It
always
takes
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
What
about
Tony?
He's
looking
forward

Now,
come
on,
Tony.
I
don't
want
to
go
there.
How
come
you
don't
want
to
go?
I
just
don't.
Let's
just
wait
and
see.
We're
all
going
to
have
Bill,
I'd
like
you
How
do
you
do,
Bill?
-Nice
to
meet
you.
Grab
a
chair,
Bill.
Join
in.
Jack
is
going
to
take
care
of
I'd
like
you
to
take
him
around
Fine.
Jack
is
a
schoolteacher.
Uh,
formerly
a
schoolteacher.
BILL:
I'm
a
writer.
Teaching's
been
more
or
less
This
ought
to
be
Well,
I'm
looking
for
a
change.
Our
people
in
Denver
recommended
...I
agree
with
them.
Let's
see,
where
were
we?
I
was
about
to
explain...
...that
our
season
here
runs
from
Then
we
close
down
completely
Do
you
mind
if
I
ask
why
you
do
that?
It
seems
to
me
that
the
skiing
It
would
be.
The
problem
is
...it
would
be
to
keep
It's
a
25-mile
stretch
of
road.
It
gets
20
feet
of
snow
There's
just
no
way
to
make
it
...to
keep
it
clear.
When
the
place
was
built
in
1907...
...there
was
very
little
interest
This
site
was
chosen
for
its
It's
certainly
got
plenty
of
that.
That's
right.
Did
they
give
you
any
idea
in
Denver...
...about
what
the
job
entails?
Only
in
a
very
general
way.
Well...
...the
winters
can
be
fantastically
cruel.
The
basic
idea
is
to
cope
...and
depreciation
This
consists
mainly
...heating
different
parts
of
the
...repairing
damage
as
it
occurs...
...and
doing
repairs
so
the
That
sounds
fine
to
me.
Physically,
it's
not
The
only
thing
that
can
get
a
bit
...is
a
tremendous
sense
That
just
happens
to
be
I'm
outlining
a
new
writing
project.
Five
months
of
peace
That's
very
good,
Jack.
Because,
for
some
people...
...solitude...
...and
isolation...
...can,
of
itself,
become
a
problem.
Not
for
me.
How
about
your
wife
and
son?
They'll
love
it.
Great.
Well,
before
I
turn
you
over
to
Bill...
...there's
one
other
thing
I
think
Not
to
sound
melodramatic...
...but
it's
been
known
to
...second
thoughts
about
the
job.
I'm
intrigued.
I
don't
suppose
they
...about
the
tragedy
we
had
up
here
I
don't
believe
they
did.
ULLMAN:
My
predecessor
in
this
job...
...hired
a
man
named
Charles
Grady
He
came
up
with
his
wife
and
He
had
a
good
employment
record,
And
from
what
I've
been
told,
...like
a
completely
But
at
some
point
during
the
winter...
...he
must
have
suffered
some
kind
He
ran
amuck...
...and
killed
his
family
Stacked
them
neatly
in
a
room
...he
put
both
barrels
The
police
thought...
...that
it
was
what
the
old-timers
A
kind
of
claustrophobic
reaction
...when
people
are
shut
in
together
Wow.
That
is...
...quite
a
story.
Yeah,
it
is.
It's
still
hard
for
me
to
believe
But
it
did.
And,
uh...
...I
think
you
can
appreciate
I
certainly
can.
I
also
understand
...left
it
for
you
to
tell
me.
Obviously,
some
people
...from
staying
in
a
place
where
You
can
rest
assured
that's
not
And
as
far
as
my
wife
...I'm
sure
she'll
be
absolutely
She's
a
confirmed
ghost
story...
...and
horror
film
addict.
Tony,
do
you
think
Dad'll
get
the
job?
He
already
did.
He's
going
to
phone
Wendy
up

Hello.
-Hi,
babe.
Great.
I'm
at
the
hotel
and
I
don't
think
I
can
get
home
Sounds
like
you
got
the
job.
Right.
It's
a
beautiful
place.
You
and
Danny
are
going
to
love
it.
Tony,
why
don't
you
want
to
go
I
don't
know.
You
do
too
know.
I
don't
want
to.
Please.
No.
Now,
Tony,
tell
me.
DOCTOR:
Now,
hold
your
eyes
still
That's
good.
Now
the
other
one.
Good
boy.
Now,
Danny...
...when
you
were
brushing
...do
you
remember
if
you
...or
saw
any
bright,
flashing
No.
DOCTOR:
Do
you
remember
Yes.
What's
the
next
thing
you
remember
My
mom
was
saying,
"Wake
up.
Now,
Danny,
can
you
remember
...just
before
you
started
Talking
to
Tony.
Is
Tony
one
of
your
animals?
No.
He's
a
little
boy
Tony's
his
imaginary
friend.
DOCTOR:
If
you
were
to
open
your
mouth
now,
No.
Why
not?
Because
he
hides.
Where
does
he
go?
To
my
stomach.
Does
Tony
ever
tell
you
I
don't
want
to
talk
Okay.
That's
fine.
All
right,
Danny.
I'm
going
to
ask
you
...and
stay
quietly
in
bed
Do
I
have
to?
Yes.
I'd
like
you
to.
We're
going
in
the
other
room
I'll
come
back
and
check
on
you.
-Okay.
-Shall
we
go
into
the
living
room?
-Please.
Mrs.
Torrance,
I
don't
think
I'm
quite
sure
there's
nothing
Yeah?
Oh.
He
seems
absolutely
fine
now.
But
you
should've
seen
him.
I
know.
Kids
can
scare
you
to
death.
But
believe
me,
these
episodes
And
they
look
much
worse
But
what
was
the
matter
with
him?
Most
of
the
time,
these
episodes
They're
brought
on
by
emotional
They're
more
akin
...a
kind
of
self-induced
trance.
If
it
reoccurs,
which
I
doubt...
...we
can
always
think
about
No,
thank
you.
I'm
sure
you're
right.
Have
you
been
in
Boulder
long?
Only
about
three
months.
We're
from
Vermont.
My
husband
Did
the
appearance
Tony.
Did
Tony's
first
appearance
happen
No,
um....
Let's
see....
I
guess
Danny
started
...about
the
time
we
put
him
Did
he
adjust
well
to
school?
No.
He
didn't
like
it
too
much
at
first.
Then
he
had
an
injury,
so
we
kept
Yeah,
I
guess
that's
about
when
I
first
What
sort
of
injury
did
he
have?
He
dislocated
his
shoulder.
How
did
he
manage
to
do
that?
It
was
just
one
of
Purely
an
accident.
My
husband
had
been
drinking...
...and
he
came
home
So
he
wasn't
exactly
And
Danny
had
scattered
some
of
his
...and
my
husband
grabbed
his
arm
It's
just
the
sort
of
thing
you
do
...you
know,
in
a
park
or
in
the
street.
But
on
this
particular
occasion...
...my
husband
just
used
...and
he
injured
Danny's
arm.
Anyway,
something
good
did
come
out
"Wendy,
I'm
never
going
to
And
if
I
do,
you
can
leave
me."
And
he
didn't.
He
hasn't
had
any
alcohol
in
5
months.
Boy.
We
must
really
be
high
up.
Mm-hm.
Dad?
Yes?
I'm
hungry.
You
should've
eaten
your
breakfast.
We'll
get
you
something
Okay,
Mom.
Wasn't
it
around
here
that
I
think
that
was
farther
west,
Oh.
What
was
the
Donner
party?
They
were
a
party
of
settlers
They
got
snowbound
one
winter
They
had
to
resort
to
cannibalism
You
mean
they
ate
each
other
up?
They
had
to
in
order
to
survive.
Jack.
Don't
worry,
Mom.
I
know
all
about
cannibalism.
See,
it's
okay.
He
saw
it
on
the
television.
-What
time
does
the
plane
leave?
That
gives
us
plenty
of
time
-Goodbye,
Mr.
Ullman.
Good
morning.
I
hope
you
No
problem.
We
had
time
Good.
Glad
you
made
it
-Hi.
No,
my
son's
-Has
your
luggage
been
brought
in?
Oh,
fine.
In
view
of
all
we
have
to
cover
today...
...I
suggest
we
have
a
quick
look
Have
the
Torrances'
things
-Fine.
Oh,
yes.
This
is
our
Colorado
Lounge.
It's
beautiful.
My
God!
This
place
is
fantastic,
Isn
it,
hon?
It
sure
is.
I've
never
seen
anything
Are
all
these
I
believe
they're
based...
...mainly
on
Navajo
and
Apache
motifs.
They're
really
gorgeous.
As
a
matter
of
fact...
...this
is
probably
the
most
This
old
place
has
had
In
its
heyday,
it
was
a
stopping
...even
before
anybody
knew
We
had
four
presidents
Lots
of
movie
stars.
Royalty?
All
the
best
people.
This
is
the
staff
wing
of
the
hotel.
None
of
the
other
bedrooms
-Goodbye,
Mr.
Ullman.
ULLMAN:
Living
room,
bedroom,
bathroom.
And
a
small
bedroom
for
your
son.
Perfect
for
a
child.
-Yeah.
ULLMAN:
Well,
then.
Place
is
Easy
to
keep.
Cozy.
ULLMAN:
If
you
feel
like
spreading
out...
...you
have
the
rest
of
the
hotel
Well,
it's
very...
...homey.
Yeah.
This
is
our
famous
hedge
maze.
It's
quite
an
attraction
here.
...and
the
hedge
is
as
old
A
lot
of
fun,
but
I
wouldn't

I
had
an
hour

Can
you
both
drive
a
car?
BOTH:
ULLMAN:
That's
fine.
Basically
It
won't
take
you
long
As
a
matter
of
fact,
we
brought
...just
last
year
to
refurbish
Oh.
He
sure
did
a
beautiful
job.
Pink
and
gold
are
my
favorite
colors.
Well,
this
is
our
Gold
Ballroom.
Oh,
I'll
say!
We
can
accommodate
up
to
Boy,
we
could
really
have
I'm
afraid
you
won't
do
too
well
We
remove
the
booze
from
That
reduces
the
insurance
We
don't
drink.
Then
you're
in
luck.
Dick,
come
on
over
and
say
hello
This
is
Dick
Hallorann,
Mr.
Hallorann,
I'm
Jack.
Glad
to
meet
you.
The
Torrances
will
take
care
That's
just
great.
How
do
you
It's
just
wonderful.
Hi,
Danny!
I
found
him
outside
looking
for
you.
Dan,
did
you
get
tired
Yeah.
Come
on
over
here.
-Thanks.
I
think
it'd
be
good
if
you
could
...while
I
continue
on
with
Jack.
It
would
be
a
pleasure.
Right
this
way.
Great.
See
you
later,
hon.
Bye,
darling.
Mrs.
Torrance,
your
husband
Now,
are
you
a
"Winnie,"
I'm
a
Wendy.
Oh,
Wendy.
That's
nice.
This
is
the
kitchen,
huh?
This
is
it.
How
do
you
like
it,
Danny?
Yeah.
It's
the
biggest
place
I
ever
seen.
This
whole
place
I'll
have
to
leave
a
trail
of
Don't
let
it
get
you
down.
It's
big,
but
it
ain't
A
lot
of
this
stuff
I
wouldn't
know
One
thing
for
sure,
you
don't
You
folks
could
eat
here
for
a
year
Right
here
is
our
walk-in
freezer.
This
is
where
we
keep
You
got
15
rib
roasts...
...30
ten-pound
bags
of
hamburger.
We
got
12
turkeys,
...50
sirloin
steaks,
...and
20
legs
of
lamb.
-No.
What's
your
favorite
food,
then?
French
fries
and
ketchup.
I
think
we
can
Come
along,
now.
Mr.
Hallorann...
...how'd
you
know
we
call
him
Doc?
-Beg
your
pardon?
-I
did?
We
call
him
Doc
sometimes,
But
how
did
you
know?
I
guess
I
probably
It's
possible.
...calling
him
that
Anyway,
he
looks

Now,
this
is
the
storeroom.
In
here
is
where
we
keep...
...all
the
dried
goods
We
got
canned
fruits
...canned
fish
and
meats,
Post
Toasties,
Corn
Flakes,
...Rice
Krispies,
oatmeal,
You
got
a
dozen
jugs
We
got
60
boxes
of
dried
milk....

DICK'S
VOICE:
DICK:
...and
7
kinds
of
what
have
you.
Now,
we've
got
dried
peaches,
...dried
raisins
and
dried
prunes.
You
know,
you
got
to
keep
regular
-Hi.
-How're
you
getting
on?
Can
we
borrow
Mrs.
Torrance?
I
promise
we
won't
No
problem,
Mr.
Ullman.
I
was
just
-You
like
ice
cream,
Doc?
I
thought
you
did.
You
folks
mind
if
I
give
Danny
-Not
at
all.
-Good.
DANNY:
Yeah.
What
kind
of
ice
cream
do
you
like?
Chocolate.
Chocolate
it
shall
be.
It's
amazing,
all
this
activity
today.
The
guests
and
some
staff
...last
day's
always
hectic.
Everybody
wants
to
be
on
their
way
By
5:00
tonight,
you'll
never
WENDY:
Just
like
a
ghost
ship,
huh?
Do
you
know
how
I
knew
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about,
I
can
remember
when
I
was
...my
grandmother
and
l
...entirely
without
ever
She
called
it
"shining."
And
for
a
long
time
I
thought
...that
had
"the
shine"
to
us.
Just
like
you
probably
thought
But
there
are
other
folks...
...though
mostly
they
don't
How
long
have
you
Why
don't
you
want
to
talk
about
it?
I'm
not
supposed
to.
Who
says
you
ain't
supposed
to?
Tony.
Who's
Tony?
Tony's
the
little
boy
Is
Tony
the
one
that...
...tells
you
things?
Yes.
How
does
he
tell
you
things?
It's
like
I
go
to
sleep,
But
when
I
wake
up,
Does
your
mom
and
dad
Yes.
Do
they
know
he
tells
you
things?
Tony
told
me
never
to
tell
them.
Has
Tony
ever
told
you
About
the
Overlook
Hotel?
I
don't
know.
Now
think
real
hard,
Doc.
Think.
Maybe
he
showed
me
something.
Try
to
think
of
what
it
was.
Mr.
Hallorann,
are
you
scared
No.
Scared
of
nothing
here.
It's
just
that...
...you
know,
some
places
Some
shine...
...and
some
don't.
I
guess
you
could
say
...has
something
about
it
Is
there
something
bad
here?
Well...
...you
know,
Doc,
...it
can
leave
a
trace
Say,
like...
...if
someone
burns
toast.
Well....
Maybe
things
that
happen
Not
things
that
anyone
can
notice.
But
things
that
people
Just
like
they
can
see
things
...well...
...sometimes
they
can
see
things
I
think
a
lot
of
things
...in
this
particular
hotel
And
not
all
of
them
was
good.
What
about
room
237?
Room
237?
You're
scared
of
room
237,
ain't
you?
No,
I
ain't.
Mr.
Hallorann,
what
is
in
room
237?
Nothing.
There
ain't
nothing
in
room
237.
But
you
ain't
got
no
business
So
stay
out.
You
understand?
Stay
out!


Good
morning,
hon.
Your
breakfast
is
ready.
What
time
is
it?
It's
about
11:30.
Eleven-thirty,
Jesus.
I
guess
we've
been
I
know
it.
I
made
them
just
the
way
Nice.
It's
really
pretty
outside.
How
about
taking
me
for
a
walk
I
suppose
I
ought
to
try
Any
ideas
yet?
Lots
of
ideas.
No
good
ones.
Something
will
come.
It's
just
a
matter
of
settling
into
Yep.
That's
all
it
is.
It's
really
nice
up
here,
Isn
it?
I
love
it.
I
really
do.
I've
never
been
this
happy
It's
amazing
how
fast
you
get
I
tell
you,
when
we
first
...I
thought
it
was
kind
of
scary.
I
fell
in
love
with
it
right
away.
When
I
came
up
here
...it
was
as
though
I
mean,
we
all
have
moments
...but
this
was
ridiculous.
It
was
almost
as
though
I
knew...
...what
was
going
to
be
Ooh-woo-ooh.

The
loser
has
to
keep
-All
right.
And
I'm
going
to
get
you.

Look
out!
I'm
coming
in
close.
DANNY:
WENDY:
Oh,
no!
Okay.
Danny,
you
win.
Let's
take
the
rest
of
this
walking.
-Okay.
Give
me
your
hand.
Isn
it
beautiful?
Yeah.
DANNY:
WENDY:
-Isn
it
beautiful?
It's
so
pretty.
Yeah.
I
didn't
think
it
was
Nope.

And
the
search
continues
Twenty-four-year-old

Robertson
She
disappeared
on
a
hunting
trip
They
may
have
to
...if
a
predicted
snowstorm
It's
so
beautiful
...it's
hard
to
believe
I
want
to
go
outside
...yet
to
our
north,
to
our
west,
And
it's
moving...
...right
here
towards
Colorado

Hi,
hon.
How's
it
going?
Fine.
Get
a
lot
written
today?
Yes.
Hey,
the
weather
forecast
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it?
Come
on,
hon.
Don't
be
so
grouchy.
I'm
not...
...being
grouchy.
I
just
want
to
finish
my
work.
Okay.
I
understand.
I'll
come
back
later
Maybe
you'll
let
me
Wendy...
...let
me
explain
something
to
you.
When
you
come
in
and
interrupt,
You're
distracting
me...
...and
it
will
then
take
me
time
Understand?
Yeah.
Fine.
We're
going
to
make
a
new
rule:
Whenever
I'm
in
here...
...and
you
hear
me
typing...

...or
whatever
the
fuck
...when
I'm
in
here,
That
means
don't
come
in.
Now,
do
you
think
Yeah.
Fine.
Why
don't
you
start
right
now
Okay.

WENDY:
I
know
you've
got
more.
DANNY:
DANNY:
No
fair
anymore.

Oh,
no.
I
knew
it.

Hi,
this
is
Wendy
Torrance
Hi,
how
are
you
folks
We're
just
fine.
But
our
telephones
Are
the
lines
down,
Yes,
quite
a
few
of
them
are
down
Any
chance
of
them
Well,
I
wouldn't
like
to
say.
Most
winters
they
stay
that
way
Boy,
this
storm
is
really
something,
Yes.
It's
one
of
the
worst
Is
there
anything
else
we
can
I
suppose
not.
Over.
If
you
folks
have
any
problems
And,
Mrs.
Torrance?
It
might
be
a
good
idea
if
you
Okay.
We'll
do
that.
It
was
real
nice
talking
to
you.
Bye.
Over
and
out.
GIRLS:
Come
and
play
with
us.
Come
and
play
with
us,
Danny.
Forever...
...and
ever...
...and
ever.
Tony...
...I'm
scared.
Remember
what
Mr.
Hallorann
said.
It's
just
like
pictures
in
a
book,
Danny.
It
Isn
real.
Please
let
me
give
you
some
money.
I
wouldn't
think
of
it.
Well,
how
can
I
repay
you?
It's
okay.
Really.
Well,
I'm
going
to
have
some
coffee.
Would
you
like
some?
Sure.
Great.
Sit
down.
Ooh,
marvelous
doughnuts.
-Coffee
will
be
ready--
WENDY:
DANNY:
Can
I
go
up
to
my
room
WENDY:
DANNY:
WENDY:
He
only
went
to
bed
a
few
hours
ago.
Can't
you
wait
till
later?
DANNY:
I
won't
make
a
sound.
WENDY:
But
really
don't
make
a
sound.
DANNY:
Make
sure
you
come
right
back...
...because
I'm
going
to
-Okay?
Can
I
go
to
my
room
Come
here
for
a
minute
first.
How's
it
going,
Doc?
Okay.
Having
a
good
time?
Yes,
Dad.
Good.
I
want
you
to
have
a
good
time.
I
am,
Dad.
Dad?
Yes?
Do
you
feel
bad?
No.
I'm
just
a
little
bit
tired.
Then
why
don't
you
go
to
sleep?
I
can't.
I
got
too
much
to
do.
Dad?
Yes?
Do
you
like
this
hotel?
Yes.
I
do.
I
love
it.
Don't
you?
I
guess
so.
Good.
I
want
you
to
like
it
here.
I
wish
we
could
stay
here
forever...
...and
ever...
...and
ever.
Dad?
What?
You
would
never
hurt
Mommy
or
me,
What
do
you
mean?
Did
your
mother
ever
say
that
to
you?
That
I
would
hurt
you?
No,
Dad.
You
sure?
Yes,
Dad.
I
love
you,
Danny.
I
love
you
more
than
anything
else...
...in
the
whole
world...
...and
I
would
never
do
anything
...never.
You
know
that,
don't
you?
-Hm?
Good.


Mom?
Mom?
Mom,
are
you
in
there?



WENDY:
Jack?
Jack!
Jack!
What
happened?
Honey...
...what's
wrong?
Jack?
I
had
the
most...
...terrible
nightmare
I
ever
had.
-It
was
the
most
horrible
dream.
Really.
I
dreamed
that
l...
...that
I
killed
you
and
Danny.
But
I
didn't
just
kill
you.
I
cut
you
up
into
little
pieces.
My
God.
I
must
be
losing
my
mind.
Everything's
going
to
be
all
right.
Come
on.
Let's
get
up
off
the
floor.
It's
okay.
There.
Now
sit
up.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Danny!
Everything's
okay!
Just
go
play
in
your
room
for
a
while.
Your
dad's
just
got
a
headache.
Danny,
mind
what
I
say.
Honey,
let
me
just
go
I'll
be
right
back.
Danny.
Why
don't
you
mind
me?
Oh,
Danny.
Oh,
my
God.
What
happened
to
your
neck?
Danny,
what
happened
to
your
neck?
Huh?
You
did
this
to
him...
...didn't
you?!
You
son
of
a
bitch!
You
did
this
to
him!
Didn't
you?!
How
could
you?!
How
could
you?!
Oh.

God!
I'd
give
anything
for
a
drink.
I'd
give
my
goddamn
soul...
...for
just
a
glass
of
beer.
Hi,
Lloyd.
A
little
slow
tonight,
Isn
it?
Yes,
it
is,
Mr.
Torrance.
What
will
it
be?
I'm
awfully
glad
...because
I
just
happen
to
have
...and
two
tens
I
was
afraid
they
were
So
here's
what:
You
slip
me
a
bottle
of
bourbon...
...a
little
glass
and
some
ice.
You
can
do
that,
can't
you,
Lloyd?
You're
not
too
busy,
are
you?
No,
sir.
I'm
not
busy
at
all.
Good
man.
You
set
them
up...
...and
I'll
knock
them
back,
White
man's
burden,
Lloyd,
my
man.
White
man's
burden.
Say,
Lloyd...
...it
seems
I'm
temporarily
light.
How's
my
credit
in
this
joint,
anyway?
Your
credit's
fine,
Mr.
Torrance.
That's
swell.
I
like
you,
Lloyd.
I
always
liked
you.
You
were
always
the
best
of
them.
Best
goddamned
bartender...
...from
Timbuktu
to
Portland,
Maine.
Or
Portland,
Oregon,
for
that
matter.
Thank
you
for
saying
so.
Here's
to
five
miserable
months
...and
all
the
irreparable
harm
How
are
things
going,
Mr.
Torrance?
Things
could
be
better.
Things
could
be
I
hope
it's
nothing
serious.
No.
Nothing
serious.
Just
a
little
problem
with...
...the
old
sperm
bank
upstairs.
Nothing
I
can't
handle,
though.
Thanks.
Women.
Can't
live
with
them...
...can't
live
without
them.
Words
of
wisdom,
Lloyd.
Words
of...
...wisdom.
I
never
laid
a
hand
on
him,
I
didn't.
I
wouldn't
touch
one
hair
I
love
the
little
son
of
a
bitch.
I'd
do
anything
for
him.
Any
fucking
thing
for
him.
But
that
bitch!
As
long
as
I
live...
...she'll
never
let
me
forget
I
did
hurt
him
once,
okay?
It
was
an
accident.
Completely
unintentional.
It
could
have
happened
to
anybody.
And
it
was
three
goddamn
years
ago!
The
little
fucker
had
thrown
all
my
All
I
tried
to
do
was
pull
him
up.
A
momentary
loss
of
I
mean...
...a
few
extra
foot-pounds
of
energy...
...per
second,
per
second.
WENDY:
Oh,
Jack.
Thank
God
you're
here.
Jack.
There's
someone
else
There's
a
crazy
woman
She
tried
to
strangle
Danny.
Are
you
out
of
your
fucking
mind?
No.
It's
the
truth!
Really.
I
swear
it.
Danny
told
me.
He
went
up
into
one
of
the
bedrooms.
The
door
was
open,
and
he
saw
this
She
tried
to
strangle
him!
Which
room
was
it?

MAN
:
We're
sorry.
If
you
need
assistance,

Jack?
JACK:
Thank
God.
Did
you
find
anything?
No.
Nothing
at
all.
I
didn't
see
one
goddamn
thing.
You
went
into
the
room
Danny
said?
Yes,
I
did.
And
you
didn't
see
anything
at
all?
Absolutely
nothing.
How
is
he?
He's
still
asleep.
Good.
I'm
sure
he'll
be
himself
again
Are
you
sure
it
was
the
right
room?
I
mean,
maybe
Danny
made
a
mistake.
He
must
have
gone
in
that
room.
The
door
was
open,
I
just
don't
understand
it.
What
about
those
bruises
on
his
neck?
Somebody
did
that
to
him.
I
think...
...he
did
it
to
himself.
No.
That's
not
possible.
Wendy...
...once
you
rule
out
his
version
...there
is
no
other
explanation.
Is
there?
It
wouldn't
be
that
different
...that
he
had
before
Would
it?

WENDY:
Whatever
the
explanation
is...
...I
think
we...
...have
to
get
Danny
out
of
here.
Get
him
out
of
here?
Yes.
You
mean...
...just
leave
the
hotel?
Yes.

MAN
:
Hello,
my
name
is
Dick
Hallorann.
I'm
the
head
chef
at
Good
evening.
I've
been
trying
to
make
...but
the
operator
said
A
lot
of
lines
around
here
I
hate
to
put
you
through
...but
there's
a
family
up
there
And
with
this
storm
...I'd
appreciate
it
if
you'd
give
...just
to
see
if
everything's
okay.
I'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
Why
don't
you
call
me
back
Thank
you
very
much.
All
right,
sir.


Good
evening,
Mr.
Torrance.
Good
evening.
Hi,
Lloyd.
Been
away,
but
now
I'm
back.
Good
evening,
Mr.
Torrance.
It's
good
to
see
you.
It's
good
to
be
back,
Lloyd.
What'll
it
be,
sir?
Hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
me.
Bourbon
on
the
rocks.
That'll
do
her.
No
charge
to
you,
Mr.
Torrance.
No
charge?
Your
money's
no
good
here.
Orders
from
the
house.
Orders
from
the
house.
Drink
up,
Mr.
Torrance.
I'm
the
kind
of
man
likes
to
know
It's
not
a
matter
that
concerns
you,
At
least,
not
at
this
point.
Anything
you
say,
Lloyd.
Anything
you
say.
Oh!
Oh,
dear!
I'm
so
sorry,
sir.
-Oh.
I've
made
an
awful
mess
Oh,
that's
all
right.
I'm
afraid
it's
advocaat,
sir.
Advocaat,
is
it?
Yes,
sir.
I
think
the
best
thing...
...is
to
come
along
...and
we'll
get
Looks
like
you
might
have
got
a
...Jeevesy
old
boy.
That
doesn't
matter,
sir.
Awfully
nice
of
you
to
say.
Of
course,
I
intended
to
change
...before
the
fish
and
goose
soiree.
Very
wise,
sir.
Very
wise.
JACK:
...hold
this
for
you
there,
Thank
you,
sir.
Thank
you.
Let's
see
if
we
can
improve
this
All
right.
I'll
just...
...set
my
bourbon
and
advocaat
Won't
keep
you
a
moment.
Fine.
What
do
they
call
you,
Jeevesy?
Grady,
sir.
Delbert
Grady.
Grady?
Yes,
sir.
Delbert
Grady.
That's
right,
sir.
Uh....
Mr.
Grady...
...haven't
I
seen
you
Why,
no,
sir.
I
don't
believe
so.
It's
coming
off
now,
sir.
Uh...
...Mr.
Grady...
...weren't
you
once
Why,
no,
sir.
I
don't
believe
so.
You
a
married
man,
are
you,
Mr.
Grady?
Yes,
sir.
I
have
a
wife
and
two
daughters,
sir.
And...
...where
are
they
now?
They're
somewhere
around.
Mr.
Grady.
You
were
the
caretaker
here.
I
recognize
you.
I
saw
your
picture
You...
...chopped
your
wife
and
daughter
And...
...then
you
blew
your
brains
out.
That's
strange,
sir.
I
don't
have
any
recollection
Mr.
Grady...
...you
were
the
caretaker
here.
I'm
sorry
to
differ
with
you,
sir.
But
you...
...are
the
caretaker.
You've
always
been
the
caretaker.
I
should
know,
sir.
I've
always
been
here.
Did
you
know,
Mr.
Torrance...
...that
your
son...
...is
attempting
to
bring
...into
this
situation?
Did
you
know
that?
No.
He
is,
Mr.
Torrance.
Who?
A
nigger.
A
nigger?
A
nigger...
...cook.
How?
Your
son...
...has
a
very
great
talent.
I
don't
think
you
are
aware
But
he
is
attempting
to
use
...against
your
will.
Well...
...he
is
a
very
willful
boy.
Indeed
he
is,
Mr.
Torrance.
A
very
willful
boy.
A
rather...
...naughty
boy...
...if
I
may
be
so
bold,
sir.
It's
his
mother.
She...
...interferes.
Perhaps
they
need
a
good...
...talking-to.
If...
...you
don't
mind
my
saying
so.
Perhaps...
...a
bit
more.
My
girls,
sir...
...they
didn't
care
for
One
of
them
actually
stole
...and
tried
to
burn
it
down.
But
l...
...corrected
them,
sir.
And
when
my
wife
tried
to
prevent
me
...I...
...corrected
her.
We
have
the
Snowcat.
If
the
weather
breaks...
...we
might
just
be
able...
...to
get
down
the
mountain.

I
could
call
...and...
...tell
them
that
we're
coming...
...so
that...
...they
could
start
searching
And
if
Jack
won't
come
with
us...
...I'll
just
have
to
tell
him
that
That's
all
there
is
to
it.

You

remember.
No...
...I
can't.
JACK:
Maybe
it
was
about
him.
I
think
we
should
discuss
Danny.
I
think...
...we
should
discuss
What
should
be
done
with
him?
I
don't
know.
I

you

...about
what
should
be
done

think
maybe
he

think
"maybe"
Yes.

do
you
think
"maybe"
As
soon
as
possible?

Please.
You
believe

health
Yes.

you
are
concerned
about
him.
Yes.
And
are
you
concerned
about
me?
Of
course
I
am.
Of

you
are!

you
ever
thought
about
What
are
you
talking
about?
Have
you
ever

...thought
about
Have
you
ever
thought
...about
my
responsibilities
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you...
...that
I
have
agreed
to
look
after
Does
it
matter
to
you
at
all...
...that
the
owners
have
placed
...and
that
I
have
signed
...in
which
I've
accepted
Do
you
have
the
slightest
idea...
...what
a
moral
and
ethical
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
what
...if
I
fail
to
live
up
to
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you?
Stay
away
from
me!
Why?
I
just
want
to
go
back
to
my
room.
Why?
Well...
...I'm
very
confused.
And
I
just
need
a
chance
You've
had
your
whole
fucking
life
What
good's
a
few
minutes
more
Stay
away
from
me!

you.

from
me!
-Wendy.
Darling.
Light

my
life.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
You
didn't
let
me
finish
I
said,
"I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you."
I'm
just
going
to
bash
I'm
going
to
bash
them
Stay
away
from
me!
Don't
hurt
me!
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
Stay

from
me!
Stay

Please!
Stop
swinging
the

bat
down,
Wendy.

Hey.
Wait

What
are
you
doing?
Open
the
door!
Goddamn
it!
Let
me
out
of
here!
Wendy,
listen.
Let
me
out
and
I'll
forget
It'll
be
just
like
nothing
ever
happened.
Wendy,
baby.
I
think
you
hurt
my
head
real
bad.
I'm
dizzy.
I
need
a
doctor.
Honey.
Don't
leave
me
in
here.
I'm
going
to
go
now.
I'm
going
to
try...
...to
get
Danny
down
...in
the
Snowcat
today.
I'll
bring
back
a
doctor.
Wendy.
WENDY:
Wendy.
Yes.
You've
got
a
big
surprise
You're
not
going
anywhere.
Go
check
out
the
Snowcat
and
the

Go
check
it
out.
Go
check
it
out!
Go
check
it
out.


Wendy?
GRADY:
Delbert
Grady.
Grady?
Oh,
Grady.
Grady,
uh....
Hello,
Grady.
Mr.
Torrance...
...I
see
you
can
hardly
...business
we
discussed.
No
need
to
rub
it
in,
Mr.
Grady.
I'll
deal
with
that
situation
Will
you
indeed,
Mr.
Torrance?
I
wonder.
I
have
my
doubts.
I,
and
others,
have
come
to
believe...
...that
your
heart
is
not
in
this.
That
you
haven't
the
belly
for
it.
Just
give
me
one
more
chance
That's
all
I
ask.
Your
wife
appears
to
be
stronger
Somewhat
more...
...resourceful.
She
seems
to
have
got
For
the
moment,
Mr.
Grady.
Only
for
the
moment.
I
fear
you
will
have
to
deal
...in
the
harshest
possible
way,
I
fear...
...that
is
the
only
thing
to
do.
There's
nothing
I
look
forward
to...
...with
greater
pleasure,
Mr.
Grady.
You
give
your
word
on
that,
I
give
you
my
word.
