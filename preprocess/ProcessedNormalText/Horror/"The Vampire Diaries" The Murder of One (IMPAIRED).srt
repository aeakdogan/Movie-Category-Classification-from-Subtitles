NARRATOR:
FORBES:
Someone
drove
this
stake
I'd
know
if
I
were
killing.
You
wear
a
ring
that
lets
you
cheat
death.
How
many
times
can
you
die
-
What
are
you
doing
here,
Sage?
He's
my
one
true
love.
Esther's
planning
on
killing
her
family.
She's
linked
them
all
together.
It's
not
over,
Nik.
A
white
oak
tree
300
-
That
tree
could
kill
us.
...chopped
down
an
old
white
oak
tree
-
We
have
a
weapon.
Morning,
sunshine.
Hey.
How's
Alaric?
Indecent.
But
fine.
So
then
does
that
mean
Nope.
Slept
like
a
baby.
Woke
up
Alaric.
No
headlines
Then
why
do
I
feel
like
Maybe
because
you're
being
all
paranoid
What'd
you
bring
me?
Ooh,
chocolate
muffins.
The
way
to
a
killer's
heart
They're
not
for
you.
Fine.
Keep
convincing
yourself
But
sadly,
Ric's
gonna
have
to
miss
You
know,
lockdown
and
all.
Just
take
it,
give
it
to
him,
-
With
pleasure.
DAMON:

Walking
down
the
stairs.
Opening
front
door...
...and
she's
gone.
STEFAN:
This
needs
a
sharper
point.
We
have
stakes
to
kill
an
Original.
I
said,
I
got
it.
Stop
micromanaging.
If
you
guys
got
this
under
control,
-
I
wanna
turn
myself
in.
I
have
a
homicidal
alter
ego.
...I
would
like
to
take
responsibility
If
you
wanted
to
turn
yourself
in,
You
cannot
psychoanalyze
me.
I
nearly
killed
Meredith.
You're
not
turning
yourself
in.
...and
we
have
Originals
to
kill.
His
morals
get
questionable
Klaus
needs
to
die.
So
you
are
not
turning
yourself
in.
Here's
your
ring,
Ric.
Put
it
on.
That
ring
is
the
reason
DAMON:
You're
going
vampire
hunting,
Ric.
CAROLINE:
I
can't
expect
you
to
be
okay
with
this...
...but
these
herbs
that
Bonnie's
...and
keeping
the
dark
side
buried.
Yeah,
and
that's
supposed
No,
it's
not
okay.
It's
horrible,
He's
a
victim
of
something
supernatural.
It
just
happened
to
him,
She
didn't
ask
to
become
a
vampire...
...and
neither
did
Stefan
or
Tyler.
Or
me.
Or
you.
None
of
you
asked
for
this.
But
who
would
I
be
Oh,
Elena
Gilbert.
Savior
of
the
cursed
and
the
damned.
Hey.
What's
with
the
cryptic
I
don't
know.
Where's
Bonnie?
I
texted
her
too.
Uh,
Bonnie's
mom
bailed
on
her
again.
-
So
I
think
we
should
leave
her
out.
I
found
some
more
white
oak.
Hang
on.
White
oak?
Nope.
We
all
have
a
weapon.
-
Hello,
Finn.
-
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
I
will
ask
you
one
time,
though.
Gone
to
find
another
way
And
when
she
does,
How
fortunate
that
I
found
you.
I
have
no
wish
to
help
you.
Right.
You
see,
...because
if
I
die,
then
you
die,
Bother
someone
else
Why,
when
I
can
bother
my
big
brother?
I
need
you
to
accompany
me
I
have
a
witch
who
can
help
undo
-
I
have
no
wish
to
be
unlinked.
Let
me
rephrase.
You
will
come
back
...in
that
coffin
What
happens
to
one
happens
to
all.
You
may
not
feel
...but
you'd
lose
your
precious
Rebekah.
Wouldn't
be
the
first
time.
Let's
not
make
this
any
worse
You're
siding
with
him?
At
least
he's
not
trying
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Kill
me?
Oh,
yeah,
that's
right.
Fine.
Pathetic,
but
fine.
The
thing
is
I'm
not
gonna
let
you


STEFAN:
Klaus
has
always
been
But
now
we
have
the
advantage.
We're
all
armed
and
they
are
all
linked.
Meaning
we
only
need
We
need
to
seize
the
best
opportunity...
...which
means
we
need
Scenario
number
one.
-
Okay.
We'll
distract
her,
catch
her
off
guard.
To
do
that,
we
need
to
keep
Klaus
-
Caroline.
He's
obsessed
with
you.
But
for
right
We
use
the
quarterback
to
distract
her.
-
How?
-
Clearly.
She
slept
with
you.
Beefcake
holds
bombshell.
...grab
her
arms
like
this.
Which
gives
me
time
for
one
shot.
Got
it?
Good.
We
keep
it
hidden,
and
we
look
out
No
last-minute
attacks
of
pity
ELENA:
Not
after
what
happened
-
Barbie?
Anything
that
will
free
Tyler
DAMON:
Busboy?
Good
point.
We
have
12
stakes.
We
can
do
this.
All
right.
Let's
try
another
scenario.
Elena,
grab
a
crossbow.

Gather
your
witch.
-
You
can't
force
me
to
help
you.
...but
why
force
when
I
can
persuade?
Hello,
Finn.
Sage.
What
do
you
know?
True
love
prevails.
KLAUS:
Easier
than
torturing
him.
I
have
something
to
do.
What
do
you
Just
your
blood
and
your
blessing.
I
have
some
unfinished
business
Ask
Sage
what
he
did
to
me...
...then
you'll
understand
I
mean,
did
you
learn
nothing
Why?
Where'd
you
put
yours?

What
the
hell
was
that?


Ric?
-
Unh.

Bonnie,
we're
starting
Or
call
Caroline.
Mr.
Saltzman
was,
like,
Is
it
weird
that
Bonnie's
Is
it
weird
that
Klaus'
brother's
That's
Finn.
I
thought
he
left
town.
SAGE:
So
can
you
guess
If
memory
serves
me...
...this
is
where
the
natives
This
statue
was
built
Back
when
you
used
to
have
...to
see
your
tawdry
lady
friend.
I
assumed
after
900
years
I
took
care
of
myself.
I
don't
want
you
to
die.
-
Hey.
I
just
got
home.
Why?
Klaus'
brother
Finn
...and
he's
with
some
ex-girlfriend
Ex-girlfriend?
Guy's
been
in
a
coffin
-
Sage.
It's
gotta
be
Sage.
-
So
how
do
we
do
this?
Do
not
do
anything,
okay?
-
You
don't
stand
a
chance.

What
the
hell
happened
to
you?
-
Stefan.
I
think
we
have
a
problem.

I
found
them
in
the
shed.
What
kind
of
monster
would
trap
I
gotta
admit,
You
pretended
...and
then
you
slept
with
me
...could
steal
my
thoughts.
Ever
since
then,
I've
felt
So
I've
decided
to
bleed
the
vervain
Ooh.

You
wanna
compel
me
Actually,
I'd
rather
compel
you
But
since
vampires
heal,
We
should
probably
stick

-
Hmm.
If
you're
trying
to
bleed
him
of
vervain...
...think
it
would
be
easier
I'm
capable
of
inflicting
pain,
Oh,
well,
excuse
me.
It's
not
like
You
know,
why
don't
you
just
leave
Hmm,
now,
where
were
we?
Ticktock.
I
should
hear
chanting
by
now.
I'm
still
studying
the
unlinking
spell.
It's
not
that
easy,
You've
been
warned.
If
you're
looking
...I
will
kill
anyone
This
is
the
spell.
Then
you
should
have
Your
energy
helped
my
mother
link
us.
Honestly,
I
think
someone
Very
well.
Kol.
How's
the
weather
up
there
And
how's
our
friend?
May
I
see
him?
There's
Jeremy.
Playing
fetch
with
his
new
puppy.
Isn't
that
just
the
most
adorable
thing
Thank
you,
Kol.
We'll
be
in
touch.
So,
Bonnie...
...about
that
spell.
Hey.
I
hear
you
had
a
run-in

Yeah,
I'll
live.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Checking
up
on
you...
...in
case
you're
not
you.
I'm
me.
Well,
I
guess
not-you
...which
is
why
Elena
said
I
hope
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells.
It
doesn't.
Mm.
That's
disgusting.
Well,
it's
either
that
or
kill
people,
so...
Elena
told
me
everything.

Caroline...
...I
am
so
sorry.
I
don't
even
know
what
else
I
could
say.

Right
after
I
turned
into
a
vampire,
A
stranger.
I
just
killed
him.
And
what's
worse
is
I
liked
it.
I
have
blood
on
my
hands
too.
Yeah,
but
the
blood
on
my
hands
Yeah,
it
is.
And
maybe
the
guy
I
killed
Look.
All
I
know
is
I'm
no
better
than
you.
So
I'm
going
to
take
a
page
...and
choose
to
believe
Okay?
Okay.
Hey.
How
is
he?
Hey.
He's
just
banged
up.
Caroline's
gonna
stay
with
him,
Matt
texted
me.
Finn
is
still
in
the
Grill.
We
need
to
plan
our
next
move.
Uh,
Rebekah
has
Damon.
No,
we
need
to
stay
on
point.
See
an
Original,
kill
an
Original.
That
was
the
plan
before
Damon's
I
understand
you're
concerned
...we
were
talking
about
missing
...he
would
lose
his
mind.
If
the
roles
were
reversed,
I
know
what
my
brother
would
want.
What
he
would
want
and
what
we
Are
you
gonna
help
me
with
this
or
not?
Okay.
I'll
figure
it
out
myself.

What
are
you
doing?
Rebekah
will
kill
you.
Then
hurry
up
and
tell
me
what
to
do.
Open.
Carefully.

Come
on,
come
on.
-
I
need
a
minute.
Don't
be
an
idiot,
Elena.
I
am
not
going
to
leave
you.
Damon.
No.
Hey,
hey.
Drink.

Ugh.
You
bitch.
It's
not
fun
when
someone
messes
Actually,
I
was
having
Well,
I
hope
you
were
nicer
to
Elena
Oh,
come
on.
I
couldn't
have
hurt
you
that
bad.
You
didn't
think
I
get
it.
If
Klaus
bossed
me
around
...I'd
probably


BONNIE:
What
was
that?
Well,
it
does
bother
me.
You
bother
me.
The
way
you
use
people
You're
being
emotional,
Bonnie.
I
understand
that
things
You
know,
with
your
mother
It's
very
sad.
I
can
help
you
find
her.
If
you
want.
I
can
bring
her
back
to
you.
Or,
if
you
choose,
Isn't
it
obvious
that
I'm
just
gonna
...until
you
do
the
spell?
And
I
know
it
requires
the
blood
So
here
we
are.
Elijah,
Rebekah,
Kol
and
Finn.

Where
do
you
want
us?
SAGE:
You've
never
had
tequila
before?
SAGE:
Seriously.
I'm
embarrassed
for
you.
[ALABAMA
SHAKES'
On
your
way
to
the
promised
land
FINN:
Happy
now?
Ah.
I
am
truly
awed

-
Hey,
Sage.
I
don't
know
if
I
can
follow
FINN:
You
know
him?
You
turned
him.
Why?
I'm
in
enemy
territory.
...I
thought
I
might
need
a
little
backup.
-
Two
more
tequilas.
-
Cool,
I'll,
uh,
let
your
waitress
know.

How
many
people
have
you
turned?
I
don't
know.
A
lot.
Don't
judge
me,
Finn,
you
turned
me.
Exactly,
Sage.
I
turned
you.
My
passion
overtook
my
morals.
My
passions
overtake
my
morals
It's
called
living
life
to
the
fullest.

Finally.
Oh.
Thanks.
-
To
living
life
to
the
fullest.


What
the
hell?
Vervain.


Finn,
the
stake.

No!
No.


Finn,
no.
REBEKAH:
Sister,
be
nice.
Thank
you,
Bonnie.
See
you
in
Physics
class.
Oh,
my
God.
KLAUS:
Apparently
Damon
hurt
her
feelings.
DAMON:
Go
on.
Help
him.
Save
the
man
who
turned
your
mother
-
Just
get
me
out
of
here.
Hey,
how's
Alaric?
He'll
be
okay.
I
gave
him
a
bottle
Oh.
Did
you
guys
kill
Finn?
Did
it
work?
Nothing
worked
until
I
see

Oh.
Bonnie.
Where
have
you
been?
Klaus
has
Damon.
Klaus
should
be
dead.
They
should
all
No.
He
forced
me
to
do
a
spell

Okay,
Bonnie,
where's
Damon?
At
Klaus'
mansion.
It's
bad,
Elena.
-
Are
you
okay?
I'm
sorry.
I
have
to
go.
I
just...
I
have
to
go.
No,
Bonnie,
just...

Stay.
I'll
call
you
when
it's
over.
Stop.
Klaus
is
stronger
than
you.
What
we
need
is
for
Klaus
to
be
dead.
Stefan,
stop
it.
You're
acting
on
anger.
Anger
gets
things
done,
Elena.
Or
it'll
get
you
killed.
Klaus
does
not
get
to
survive
this.
Not
after
everything
he
took
from
me.

I
miss
well-adjusted
Stefan.
Ding-dong.

I'm
not
here
for
you.
I'm
here
for
him.

I
don't
think
so.
I
had
to
kill
him,
Sage.
-
Oh.
You
remember
me.
Good.
Then
you
know

What
the
hell?
Sage?

SAGE:

What
is
happening
to
me?
She
just
died.
So
Sage
and
this
Troy
guy
die
But
why?
Hybrid
bites
don't
look
like
that.
Maybe
Sage
was
so
in
love
with
Finn
No,
that
doesn't
explain
Troy.
It's
the
blood.
The
bloodline.
Finn
turned
Sage.
Sage
turned
Troy.
They're
part
of
the
vampire
bloodline
Wait,
so
when
an
Original
dies...
...every
vampire
turned
from
Because
that
would
mean...
If
the
Originals
die,
so
do
all
of
you.
The
entire
vampire
species
This
was
much
different
in
my
head.
Klaus.
I'm
here.
-
Let's
do
this.
What
do
you
want?
I'm
here
to
make
a
deal.
Stefan,
what
are
you
doing?
Eight
stakes
made
of
white
oak.
The
part
of
Wickery
Bridge
-
That's
impossible.
Finn's
dead.
You
killed
my
brother?
Damon
in
exchange
for
And
how
do
I
know
Because
there
aren't.
Let's
be
certain,
shall
we?
Leave.
No.
Go
on,
leave.
Nik,
he's
my
plaything,
not
yours.

I
said,
go
home.



Vampire
disposal?
Not
my
strong
suit.
-
Ugh.
Where'd
Stefan
go?
-
All
of
them?
We
still
have
enough
to
kill
three
...if
we
can
figure
out
who
to
save.

How
are
we
supposed
to
do
that?
I
have
no
idea.
You
were
turned
with
Damon's
blood...
...and
Damon
and
Stefan
And
we
know
that
Katherine
was
turned
Well,
who
turned
Rose?
We
don't
know.
But
it
can
only
lead
back
to
one
Original.
And
if
the
odds
are
in
our
favor,
So
we
can
still
kill
him.
Elena.
Even
if
Klaus
didn't
create
...we
know
for
a
fact
Oh,
my
God.
Tyler.
If
we
kill
Klaus,
then
Tyler
will
die.

All
right,
stop.
Stop.
Well,
I
see
Now...
Ahem.
Minus
the
stake
that's
in
my
brother...
...how
many
more
stakes
are
out
there
-
Eleven.
-
So
not
eight,
then.
-
I'll
get
you
the
other
three.
...maybe
I'll
compel
-
What's
wrong
with
you?
Do
you
really
have
no
appreciation
I
have
given
you
someone
to
hate.
A
target
for
all
of
your
anger
I've
given
your
life
purpose,
I
mean,
I
really
think
-
Enough.
Step
down
or
you
both
die.
There.
Now
you
only
REBEKAH:
KLAUS:

I
brought
him
here.
I
get
to
release
him.
My
rules
now.
Bring
us
the
stakes
and
you
both
live.
Take
your
brother
Bring
us
the
stakes.
All
of
them.
Or
I'll
wage
a
war
I
hope
I'm
being
clear.
REBEKAH:
Good
riddance.
He
was
an
embarrassment,
Rebekah.
He
was
still
your
brother.
Fine.
Let's
say
a
prayer
for
Finn...
...who
slept
in
a
box
He
was
a
lovesick
fool.
Is
that
how
you'd
speak
of
me
if
I
died?
You
let
the
Salvatores
loose
So
I
guess
we'll
find
out
soon
enough.
Since
when
did
you
have
a
soft
spot
The
Salvatores
may
fight
like
dogs,
but
At
least
they
know
what
family
means.
You
destroyed
ours.
I
wanted
a
family,
And
now
we're
unlinked.
So
are
you
leaving?
Soon
as
I
get
my
stakes,
I'm
gone.
I'm
gonna
take
Elena
and
use
her
blood
And
if
I
choose
to
stay?
Then
you're
just
as
pathetic
as
Finn.
-
Hey.
You
haven't
said
much
I'll
be
a
ball
of
sunshine
Promise.
You
really
scared
me
today.
You
wouldn't
have
survived
if
you
You
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
Why?
Because
he's
not
worth
it.
All
this
time
and
energy

It
was
for
nothing.
It's
done.
It's
over.
We
lost.
I'm
right
back
where
I
started.
That's
not
true.
Yeah,
Klaus
dragged
you
through
hell,
You
beat
him
by
being
better
than
him.
And
what'd
I
lose
in
the
process?
Look,
hating
Klaus
was
easy.
It
allowed
me
to
ignore
everything
Everything
I
let
slip
away.
Now
I
have
to
deal
with
that.
-
Stefan...
Admit
it
to
me,
Elena.
You
don't
owe
it
to
me,
I
can't.
Because
it's
not
true,
Stefan.
I
never
stopped
loving
you.
I
know
that.
I
know
you
didn't.
Even
though
I
did
everything
possible
It's
my
fault.
-
It's
all
my
fault.
This
is
all
my
fault.
I'm
talking
about
the
fact
What?
No,
Stefan,
I
was
just...
Hey.
I
love
you.
I
will
always
love
you.
I
just
want
you
to
look
me
in
the
eye
...that
you
don't
feel
something
for
him.
I
don't
know
what
I
feel.
-
Ah.
You're
still
alive.
I
need
your
stake.
It's
right
behind
these
books
here.
A
bookshelf,
really?
Where
the
hell
is
it?
Ha.
-
Look
harder,
Ric.
Maybe
you
just
forgot
I
didn't
forget.
I
put
it
right
here.
-
Who
else
did
you
tell,
Ric?
What?

I'm
the
only
one
who
knew
about
it,
No.
You
telling
me
...has
a
stake
that
could
kill
an
entire
That's
exactly
what
I'm
telling
you.
