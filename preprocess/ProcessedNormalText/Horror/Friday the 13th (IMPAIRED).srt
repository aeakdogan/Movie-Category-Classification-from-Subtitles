Really.
We're
getting
the
place
in

In
shape
for
what?
Officer,
can
we
help?
Looking
for
somebody.
Who's
that?
A
guy
named
Ralph.
No

people
around
here.

you
to
sit
on
it,
Tonto.

got
word
that
Ralph
spouting
his
gospel.
We
haven't
seen
anybody
here,
Just

This
Ralph,
is
he
dangerous?
Every
time
that
loony
gets
drunk,
he
gets
his
calling.

the
morning
in

he
gets
a
week
in

Dead
animals?
You

Too
bad
Annie

She
was
supposed
to
be
a
good
cook.
Don't
expect
me
to
replace
her.
Trouble?
Bad
bulb
or
no
power.
It
