Last
season
on
AMC's
Dad!
I
owe
a
debt
to
a
man
I
met.
What's
stopping
you?
The
walkie-talkie,
the
one
You
told
me
that
he
died!
We're
heading
to
the
CDC.
If
there's
anything
left,
Where
is
everybody?
I'm
all
that's
left.
-
I
love
you.
-
No,
I'm
staying!
Andrea,
no!
They're
coming.
Get
down!

Rick:
I
guess
I'm
losing
hope
But
there's
always
that
That
slim
chance.
It's
all
about
I
tried
to
do
everything
right,
keep
people
safe.
I
tried,
Morgan.
I
tried.
Our
group's
smaller
now.
We
lost
another,
It
was
her
choice.
I
won't
say
I
blame
her,
but
she
lost
faith.
The
CDC
was
a
dead
end.
I
met
a
man
there,
a
scientist.
He
told
me
something.
He
told
me...
It
doesn't
matter.
What
matters
Atlanta's
done.
We're
gonna
try
We're
facing
a
long
maybe
even
harder
But
it
can't
be
harder
Can
it?
125
miles--
That's
what
lies
ahead.
And
I'm
trying
hard
I
can't.
My
family,
my
wife...
my
son.
There's
just
a
few
of
us
now.
So
we've
got
to
stick
together,
fight
for
each
other,
be
willing
to
lay
down
if
it
comes
to
that.
Son,
let's
saddle
up.
Rick:
It's
the
only
chance

Be
careful
out
there,
Morgan.
I
hope
you
and
Duane
are
okay.
Stay
off
the
road.
Keep
moving.
Keep
your
eyes
open.
I
don't
know,
just--
just
be
safe.
Maybe
we'll
see
you
Rick
signing
off.

Just
thinking
about
our
trip

I
don't
remember
that.
No,
you
wouldn't.
Besides,
we
never
made
it
No,
you
got
sick.
Carl:
Ick.
Yeah,
ick.
The
doctor
in
Texas
Then
we
turned
around
Carl:
No,
it
was
a
good
trip.
The
best.
Can
we
go
see
it?
I'd
like
to.
Sophia:
Can
we
go?
We'd
never
go
without
That's
a
promise.
Looks
complicated.
The
trick
is
getting
back
together
the
same
way.
I
could
clean
yours,
show
you
how.
Oh
yeah.
It's
a
sweet
piece.
It
was
a
gift
from
my
father.
He
gave
it
to
me
just
before
Amy
He
said
two
girls
on
their
own
should
be
able
Smart
man,
your
father.
Look,
it's
a--
it's
a
limited
capacity.
See?
Only
holds
Dale:
Aw
no.
See
a
way
through?
Uh,
maybe
we
should
-
There's
an
interstate
bypass--
Jeez.


I
said
it.
A
thousand
times.
Problem,
Dale?
Just
a
small
matter
of
being
with
no
hope
of--
Okay,
that
was
dumb.
If
you
can't
find
There's
a
whole
bunch
I
can
siphon
more
fuel
-
Maybe
some
water.
This
is
a
graveyard.
I
don't
know
how
All
right,
all
right,
T-Dog:
Come
on,
y'all.
gather
what
you
can.

Kids,
don't
look.
-
Which
one?
Radiator
hose
clamp
Here,
you
do
it.
Learn
something.

Ed
never
let
me
wear
We're
gonna
need
clothes.
Hey,
Carl.
Always
within
my
sight,
okay?
You
too,
Sophia.
It's
all
good.
Okay.
All
right.
Glenn.
Were
we
short
on
water?

Save
me
some!
It's
like
being
baptized,
man.
Oh,
Christ.
Lori,
under
the
cars.
Carl,
Sophia,
get
down
now.
-
Carl
and
Sophia.
Sophia.
Ow.
What?
Shh.
Oh!





Okay.
-

Shit.

-






Shh.


-




Lori.
-
There's
two
walkers
are
after
my
baby.

-

-
Are
you
all
right?
Are
you
okay?
No.
No!
Those
walkers
on
the
road
Then
it
wouldn't
be
just
two,
Come
here.

All
right,
just
hold
here.
You
stay
there.

Come
on.
Sophia,
you
have
Hide
in
there.
-
I'll
draw
them
away
from
you.
Listen
listen
listen
listen.
They
don't
get
winded.
I
can
only
deal
I
wouldn't
be
able
This
is
how
we
both
survive.
Okay?
If
I
don't
make
it
back,
back
to
the
others
Keep
the
sun
Come
on!
You
ugly
son
of
a
bitch.
Come
on!
Come
on!
Come
on!

Come
on!



Sure
this
is
the
spot?
I
left
her
right
here.
I
drew
the
walkers
way
off
Without
a
paddle--
She
was
gone
by
the
time
I
figured
she
just
took
off
I
told
her
go
that
way
and
keep
the
sun
Hey,
short
round,
why
don't
You're
mucking
up
the
trail.
Assuming
she
knows
Shane,
she
understood
me
fine.
Shane:
She
had
her
a
close
call
Got
to
wonder
how
much
Got
clear
prints
right
here.
She
did
like
you
said,
-
Let's
spread
out,
make
our
way
back.
Hey,
we
gonna
find
her.
She'll
be
tuckered
out
She
was
doing
just
fine
All
she
had
to
do
She
veered
off
that
way.
Glenn:
Maybe
she
saw
something
that
A
walker?
I
don't
see
Just
hers.
So
what
do
we
do?
No,
better
if
you
and
Glenn
People
are
gonna
Let
them
know
we're
on
her
But
most
of
all,
I'll
keep
'em
Think
up
a
few
other
chores.
Come
on.


Why
aren't
we
all
out
there
looking?
We
have
to
clear
enough
turned
around
as
soon
Now
that
we
have
fuel
to
a
bypass
that
Glenn
Going
back's
going
to
be
easier
than
We're
not
going
anywhere
Hey,
that
goes
without
saying.
Rick
and
Daryl,
-
Just
a
matter
of
time.
I'm
still
freaked
out
from
-
or
whatever
you'd
call
it.
All
of
them
just
A
herd.
We've
seen
it.
Some
wandering
pack,

Okay.
Come
on,
people.
Let's
stay
on
it.
Tracks
are
gone.
No,
they're
faint,
but
they
ain't
gone.
She
came
through
here.
How
can
you
tell?
I
don't
see
anything.
You
want
a
lesson
in
tracking
and
get
our
ass
off


-
Shane.
I
found
something
cool.
Shane,
check
it
out.
It's
an
arsenal.
That's
cool,
bud.
Check
this
one
out.
Whoa,
it's
a
hatchet.
-
Be
careful.
Don't
play
with
those.
-
What
did
I
just
say?
-
Are
you
crazy?
Shane.
Shane,
tell
her
Hey,
man,
go
give
them
-
What
was
that?
The
way
you
blew
him
off
just
now.
I
don't
believe
you.
Isn't
that
what
you
want?
Aren't
you
the
one
who
said
stay
You
forget
what
happened
Your
little
meltdown
in
the
-
When
you
tried--
What
do
you
think
that
was?
I
think
it
is
pretty
plain
A
mistake.
I
have
a
few
mistakes
So
do
you.
No
debate
there.
But
Shane,
we
need
Why
do
you
think
I'm
leaving.
Leaving?
As
in
gone
for
good.
Gonna
quietly
slip
away

Radio:
The
emergency
alert
system
The
Office
of
Civil
Defense
has
issued
Normal
broadcasting
-
This
is
a
civil
emergency.
It's
got
to
be
within
Avoid
anyone
infected
Help
is
on
the
way.
The
emergency
alert
system
-

Okay,
let's
get
back
to
work.


-


Sophia!
What
are
you
looking
for?
Skin
under
the
fingernails.
It
fed
recently.
There's
flesh
Yeah,
what
kind
of
flesh?
Only
one
way
to
know
for
sure.
Here,
I'll
do
it.
How
many
kills
you
skin
Anyway,
mine
is
sharper.


Now
comes
the
bad
part.



Yeah,
Hoss
had
a
big
meal
I
feel
it
in
there.

-
Here's
the
gut
bag.


This
gross
bastard
had
himself
At
least
we
know.
At
least
we
know.
It's
late.
They'll
find
her.
Where's
my
gun?
You
have
no
right
to
take
it.
You
don't
need
that
My
father
gave
it
to
me.
I
can
hold
onto
it
for
you.
Or
you
can
give
it
back
to
me.
Everything
cool?
No,
I
want
my
gun
back.
I
don't
think
Why
not?
I'm
not
comfortable
with
it.

The
truth
is,
less
guns
we
have
floating
You
turning
over
your
weapon?

No.
But
I'm
trained
in
its
use.
That's
what
the
rest
of
y'all
But
until
that
time
I
think
it's
best

Mind
telling
me
Oh
God,
they're
back.
You
didn't
find
her?
Her
trail
went
cold.
We'll
pick
it
up
again
You
can't
leave
my
daughter
to
spend
the
night
Out
in
the
dark's
no
good.
We'd
just
be
tripping
over
ourselves.
But
she's
12.
-
You
didn't
find
anything?
But
I'm
asking
you
We
know
she
was
out
there.
And
we
tracked
her
for
a
while.
We
have
to
make
this
Daryl
knows
the
woods
I've
asked
him
to
oversee
this.
Is
that
blood?

-
We
took
down
a
walker.
There
was
no
sign
it
was
Andrea:
We
cut
the
son
of
a
Oh
God.
How
could
you
just
leave
her
How
could
you
just
leave
her?
Those
two
walkers
were
on
us.
I
had
to
draw
them
off.
It
was
her
best
chance.
Sounds
like
he
didn't
How
was
she
supposed
to
She's
just
a
child.
It
was
my
only
option.
I'm
sure
nobody
doubts
that.
My
little
girl
got
left
Everybody
takes
a
weapon.
These
aren't
the
kind
-
What
about
the
guns?
Daryl,
Rick
and
I
are
carrying.
We
can't
have
people
popping
off
It's
not
the
trees
Say
somebody
fires
a
herd
happens
See,
then
it's
game
over
So
you
need
to
get
over
it.
Daryl:
The
idea
is
to
take
the
creek
turn
around
and
come
Chances
are
It's
her
only
landmark.
Stay
quiet
and
stay
sharp.
Keep
space
between
you
but
always
Shane:
Keep
on
those
repairs.
We've
got
to
get
We
won't
stay
here
a
minute
Good
luck
out
there.
Bring
Sophia
back.
Keep
an
eye
on
Carl
I'm
going
with
you.
You
need
people,
right?

Your
call.
Well,
he
has
all
of
you
I'd
say
he's
in
good
hands.
Okay.
But
always
within
our
sight,
Andrea,
I'm
begging
you.
I'm
not
going
out
I'll
even
say
please.
I'm
doing
this
for
you.
No,
Dale,
you're
doing
You
need
to
stop.
I'm
gonna
stick
it
in
my
mouth
and
pull
Dale:
That
much
is
clear.
But
if
I
hadn't
you'd
be
dead
now.
Jenner
gave
us
an
option.
-
You
chose
suicide.
-
I
know
Amy's
death
devastated
you.
This
is
not
about
Amy.
And
if
I
decided
that
I
had
who
the
hell
are
you
To
force
my
hand
like
that?
-
I
saved
your
life.
I
saved
yours.
I
didn't
want
and
that
is
the
only
reason
What
did
you
expect?
Some
life-affirming
Maybe
just
a
little
gratitude.
Gratitude?
I
wanted
to
die
my
way,
not
torn
apart
That
was
my
choice.
You
took
that
-
But--
All
I
wanted
after
my
sister
of
this
endless
horrific
I
wasn't
hurting
anyone
else.
You
took
my
choice
away,
Dale.
And
you
expect
gratitude?
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
I'm
not
your
little
girl.
I'm
not
your
wife.
That's
all
there
is
to
say.
Shane,
look.
Dad
said
I
could
carry
it
and
Keep
it
down.
You
need
to
focus
on
the
task.
-
Got
to
keep
up.
-
You
okay?
-
Did
I
do
something
wrong?
No,
honey,
I
promise
you.
He's
just--he's
worried
about
Come
on.
Shane:
Could
be
a
whole
bunch
Carol.
Call
out
softly.
If
she's
in
there,
yours
is
the
Sophia,
sweetie,
are
you
in
there?
Sophia,
it's
mommy.
Sophia.
It's
mommy.



Daryl?
Daryl?
It
ain't
her.
-
What's
in
there?
Did
what
Jenner
said.
Ain't
that
what
he
called
it?

What
direction?
I
think
that
way.
Damn,
it's
hard
If
we
heard
them,
Someone's
ringing
those
bells,
Or
signaling
they
found
her.
She
could
be
ringing
T-Dog:
Ain't
you
supposed
to
be
What
if
they
come
and
Rick
wants
to
-
I
had
it
fixed
yesterday.
What
was
all
that
rubbing
-
That
just
bullshit?
Another
word
just
for
show.
No
one
else
needs
to
know
that.
Pantomime.
If
the
others
know
they'll
want
to
mobilize
So
you
don't
think
they're
I'm
just
guarding
Sooner
or
later,
people
will
start
doing
math.

to
hold
off

That
is
one
tricky
hose,
huh?
Very.
That
can't
be
it.
Rick.




Sophia!
Yo,
J.C.,
I'm
telling
you,
it's
the
wrong
church.
There's
no
steeple.


A
timer.
I'm
gonna
go
back
in
for
a
bit.
Lori:
Shane:
Don't
you
think
I
think
it
is.
Gotta
back
away.
even
if
you
don't
see
it.
I
hope
you
know
that.
Well,
don't
matter.
You're
just
gonna
disappear?
He'd
only
try
to
stop
me.
You
tell
him
what
you
want.
-
You're
his
wife.
-
I
love
Carl.
I'm
trying
to
put
some
distance.
This
ain't
easy
on
any
I'm
the
one
who
loses
you.
Father,
forgive
me.
I
don't
deserve
your
mercy.
I
prayed
for
safe
passage
I
prayed
for
Ed
to
be
punished
for
laying
his
hands
on
me
and
for
looking
with
whatever
sickness
I
prayed
you'd
put
give
me
a
chance
help
her
not
make
my
mistakes.
She's
so
fearful.
She's
so
young
in
her
way.
She
hasn't
had
a
chance.
Praying
for
Ed's
death
Please,
don't
let
this
Let
her
be
safe,
alive
and
safe.
Please,
lord.
Punish
me
however
you
want,
but
show
mercy
on
her.
I'm
coming
with
you.
I
don't
know
what
the
hell
I'm
not
stupid
-
Look,
I
don't
know
the
story.
Fine,
I
don't
care.
Look,
all
I
care
about
as
far
away
as
I
can,
like
you.
We're
gonna
sail
off
into
the
sunset
together?
I'm
not
asking
you
to
go
steady,
Shane.
a
chance
to
start
over
You
observe
this
group
lately?
I
have.
I
see
two
people
We're
the
odd
men
out.
Between
the
two
of
us,
So
what?
Say
we
do,
What's
in
it
for
me
except
for
The
chance
to
do
something
-
Yeah.
Put
a
gun
in
my
hand,

Think
it
over.

Got
to
move
here,
man.
These
people
are
spent.
There's
only
so
many
-
We
still
got
a
long
way
back.
We
still
got
whole
other
side
So
we
search
that
She
would
have
heard
those
church
bells.
-
She
could
be
a
lot
of
things.
Her
being
out
here
is
my
fault.
That's
great.
Now
they
got
you
What
about
you?
Hey,
we
can
assign
This
means
something,
Oh
man.
It
would
be
the
miracle
we
need.

Mmm.
Ahem.
Y'all
gonna
follow
the
Creek
Bed
back,
okay?
Me
and
Rick,
we're
just
search
this
area
another
hour
You're
splitting
us
up.
Yeah,
we'll
catch
up
to
you.
Carl:
I'm
her
friend.
-
Just
be
careful,
okay?
When
did
you
start
growing
up?
Rick:
Here,
take
this.
Remember
how
to
use
it?
I'm
not
taking
your
gun
Here,
got
a
spare.
-
Give
me
a
minute?
Come
on.
I
don't
know
if
you're

Sadness?
Scorn?
Pity?
Love?

Maybe
it's
just
indifference.
I
guess
you
already
know
I
guess
I
just
chose
to
My
family,
mostly.
My
friends.
My
job.
The
thing
is,
we--
I
could
use
a
little
something
to
help
keep
us
going.
Some
kind
of...
acknowledgment.
Some
indication
I'm
doing
You
don't
know
Well,
maybe
you
do.
Hey
look,
I
don't
need
Just
a
little
nudge.
Any
sign
will
do.
-
Get
what
you
needed?
Carol:
This
the
whole
plan?
Daryl:
I
guess
the
plan
into
smaller
Carrying
knives
I
see
you
have
a
gun.
Why,
you
want
it?
Here,
take
it.
I'm
sick
of
the
looks
All
of
you.
Honey,
I
can't
imagine
And
I
would
do
But
you
have
got
to
stop
It
is
in
your
face
When
Sophia
ran
he
didn't
Not
for
a
second.
I
don't
know
that
any
of
us
would
or
made
the
hard
decisions
or
that
anybody
could
have
Anybody?
Y'all
look
to
him
and

If
you
think
you
can
do
this
Nobody
is
stopping
you.
We
should
keep
moving.

Shane.
