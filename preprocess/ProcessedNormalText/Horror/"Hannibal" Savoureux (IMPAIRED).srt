Oh!


I
went
to
Minnesota.
I
took
Abigail.
We
went
to
Minnesota
and...
She
didn't
come
back
with
me.
Show
me.
I
don't
remember
But...
I
must
have.
I-
I
don't
know,
maybe
I
got
up
to
let
the
dogs
out,
-
When
was
the
last
time
you
saw
Abigail?
Will.
When
was
the
last
time
Yesterday.
At
her
father's
cabin.
I
had...
an
episode.
Uh,
she
said
something
She
was
afraid
of
me.
And
she
ran
away.
What
happened?
Why
was
she
afraid?
I
hallucinated
But
it
wasn't
real.
I
know
it
wasn't
real.
Will,
we
have
to
call
Jack.
You
can't
run
from
this.
It'll
only
be
worse.
Get

until
it
was
too

Just
like
everybody
else.

Hannibal
said
that
Will
was
exhibiting
signs
of
dementia.
Dementia
isn't
a
disease.
It's
a
symptom
of

We

The
concern
is
that
there
Will
had
a
brain

Well

with

so

Despite

myself
searching
that
Abigail
Grieving
is
an
with
a
universal
goal:
the
truest
examination
and
the
meaning
of
its
end.
I
know
what
life
means.
We've
existed
for
In
that
time,
a
hundred
billion
human
lives
have
had
beginnings
and
ends.
A
hundred
billion
lives
but
clearly
and
you
seem
I
never
considered
But
after
meeting
Abigail,
The
opportunity
to
and
in
many
ways,
You
were
having
I
was
hoping
I
was.
Young
people
are
through
which
we
see
ourselves
I
think
of
my
earliest
memory
and
project
forward
to
what
I
never
think
about
living
Except
by
reputation.
Even
after
this
loss?
More
so
after
this
loss.
Will
Graham
is
a
loss,
too.
You
might
grieve
him
I
haven't
given
up
on
Will.
If
they
do
find
him
guilty
of
killing
Abigail
Hobbs...
When.
Let's
be
honest.
I
don't
recommend
you
participate
in
any
I
was
so
confident
in
To
solve
him.
To
save
him.
Saving
him,
I
lost
Abigail.
It's
hard
to
accept
so
profoundly.
-
Okay
Jimmy,
what
have
you
got?
Will
is
a
big
fly
fisherman,
all
of
his
own
lures.
Most
anglers
use
feathers,
fur,
twine,
bits
of
shell.
They
design
each
lure
This
one
caught
my
eye.
I
noticed
the
hair
color.
Took
me
a
-
I
ran
a
chem-set
to
confirm
the
connection.
Four
of
the
lures
are
made
from
And
we
have
a
DNA
match
This
one
is
Cassie
Boyle.
Bits
of
bone
fragments
Marissa
Schuur.
Antler
velvet,
a
fingernail,
Doctor
Sutcliffe.
Crushed
teeth,
soft
tissue
bound
with
cartilage
from
his
jaw.
And
this
last
lure
-
that
matches
Georgia
Madchen.
Trophies.
So
now
Will
Graham's
a
Something's
wrong

Will
He's
not
a
serial
killer.


You're
sick,

to

The
question
is,

found

Yeah,
I
should
hope
so.

I

when

then,

biggest
fear
that

knew
what
Hey,
you

be
There
is
something

What's
that?
Someone's

They'll

So
that's
it?
It's
a
setup?
They
know
the

They
know

They
know
that
I'm
unstable.

you

how
Or
it
