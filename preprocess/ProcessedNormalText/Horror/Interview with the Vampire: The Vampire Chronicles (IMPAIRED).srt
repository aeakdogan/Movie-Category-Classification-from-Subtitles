Interview.With.The.Vampire
LOUIS:
So
you
want
me
to
tell
you
MALLOY:
Like
I
said,
that's
what
I
do.
I'm
a
collector
of
lives.
FM
radio,
KFRC.
LOUIS:
No
problem.
I
got
a
bag
full
of
tape.
LOUIS:
Yeah,
I
suppose
I
did.
You
seemed
very
interesting.
This
is
where
you
live?
LOUIS:
MALLOY:
So,
what
do
you
do?
LOUIS:

That's
something
You
mean
this
literally,
I
take
it?
LOUIS:
I
was
waiting
for
you
in
that
alleyway.
Watching
you
watching
me.
And
then
you
began
to
speak.
What
a
lucky
break
for
me.
LOUIS:
MALLOY:
...waiting
for
me.
What
were
you
gonna
do?
LOUIS:
But
you
needn't
be
concerned
now.
MALLOY:
You
really
believe
this,
We
can't
begin
this
way.
Let
me
turn
on
the
light.
-I
thought
vampires
didn't
like
light.
I
only
wanted
to
prepare
you.
-Christ!
I
want
this
opportunity.
How
the
hell
did
you
do
that?
LOUIS:
A
series
of
simple
gestures.
Only
I
moved
too
fast
for
you
to
see.
I'm
flesh
and
blood,
but
not
human.
I
haven't
been
human
for
200
years.
Please....
How
can
I
put
you
at
ease?
Shall
we
begin
like
David
Copperfield?
"l
am
born.
I
grew
up."
Or
shall
we
begin
when
I
was
born
That's
really
where
we
should
start,
You're
not
lying,
are
you?
LOUIS:
1791
was
the
year
it
happened.
LOUIS:
Younger
than
you
are
now.
But
times
were
different
then.
The
master
of
a
large
plantation,
I
had
lost
my
wife
in
childbirth.
She
and
the
infant
had
been
buried
I
would've
been
happy
to
join
them.
I
couldn't
bear
the
pain
of
their
loss.
I
longed
to
be
released
from
it.
I
wanted
to
lose
it
all:
My
wealth...
...my
estate...
...my
sanity.
How
many
aces
are
in
that
deck?
Are
you
calling
me
a
cheat?

No,
I'm
calling
you
a
piece
of
stinking
offal.
You
lack
the
courage
of
your
convictions.
LOUIS:
I
know
that
now.
I
invited
it.
A
release
from
the
pain
of
living.
My
invitation
was
open
to
anyone.
To
the
whore
at
my
side.
To
the
pimp
that
followed.
But
it
was
a
vampire
that
accepted.
PIMP:





Do
you
still
want
death?
Or
have
you
tasted
it
enough?
LOUIS:
LOUIS:
He
left
me
there,
...somewhere
between
life
and
death.

Who
are
you?
I've
come
to
answer
your
prayers.
Life
has
no
meaning
anymore,
does
it?
The
wine
has
no
taste.
The
food
sickens
you.
There
seems
no
reason
What
if
I
could
give
it
back
to
you?
Pluck
out
the
pain
One
you
could
never
imagine.
And
it
would
be
for
all
time.
And
sickness
and
death...
...could
never
touch
you
again.
Don't
be
afraid.
I'm
going
to
give
you
the
choice...
...l...
...never
had.
LOUIS:
...and
I
saw
my
last
sunrise.
I
remember
it
completely...
...and
yet
I
can't
recall
I
watched
the
whole
magnificence
...as
if
it
were
the
first.
And
then
I
said
farewell
to
sunlight...
...and
set
out
to
become
what
I
became.
Have
you
said
your
goodbyes
to
the
light?

I've
drained
you
to
the
point
of
death.
If
I
leave
you
here,
you'll
die.
Or...
...you
can
be
young
always,
my
friend...
...as
we
are
now.
But
you
must
tell
me...
...will
you
come
or
no?
Yes.


LESTAT:
Pay
no
attention.
It
happens
to
us
all.
Now,
look...
...with
your
vampire
eyes.
What
did
you
see?
LOUIS:
Might
as
well
ask
heaven
what
it
sees.
No
human
can
know.
The
statue
seemed
to
move,
but
didn't.
The
world
had
changed,

I
was
a
newborn
vampire,
LOUIS:
I
would.
lt's
not
bothering
you,
is
it?
I
don't
assume
it
would.
No.
I
don't
think
so.
-What
about
crucifixes?
Can
you
look
at
them?
Actually,
l'm
quite
fond
of
And
the
stake
through
the
heart?
LOUIS:
And
coffins?
Coffins.
Coffins,
unfortunately,
are
a
necessity.
Don't
worry.
Soon...
...you'll
be
sleeping
And
when
you
awake...
...l'll
be
waiting
for
you...
...and
so
will
all
the
world.
LOUIS:
Blood,
I
was
to
find,
I
awoke
the
next
evening
with
a
hunger...
...I
had
never
felt.
Once
you
taste
this...
...you'll
never
go
to
another
tavern
again.
You
think
so?
But
what
if
l'd
rather
taste
your
lips?
My
lips
are
even
sweeter
still.

My
friend...
...should
taste
those
lips.
GIRL:
...kiss...
...as
deep
as
yours?
LESTAT:
ACTRESS:


ACTOR
2:
I
will
not
take
her
life.
I've
done
it
for
you.
She's
dead...
...as
a
doornail,
my
friend.
LESTAT:
You'll
get
used
to
killing.
You'll
become
accustomed
to
it,
Are
you
not
hungry,
sir?

He
could
eat
the
whole
colony.


I
will
finish
it.
Now
leave
us.
LESTAT:
Don't
give
the
game
away.
We're
lucky
to
have
such
a
home.

Pretend
to
drink,
at
least.
Such
fine
crystal
shouldn't
go
to
waste.
LESTAT:
It
gets
cold
so
quickly.
We
can
live
like
this?
I
wouldn't
call
it
living.
Call
it
surviving.
Useful
trick
if
you're
on
a
ship
for
a
month.
There's
nothing
in
this
world
now
Fascination.
Yes.
-I'm
bored
with
this
prattle.
-It's
possible.
But
just
try
it
for
a
week.
Come
into
New
Orleans

LOUIS:
A
fresh
young
girl...
...was
his
favorite
For
seconds,
he
preferred
a
gilded,
But
the
snob
in
him
The
blood
of
the
aristocrat
The
trick
is
not
to
think
about
it.
You
see
that
one?
Widow
St.
Clair.
She
had
that
gorgeous
young
fop
LOUIS:
Read
her
thoughts.
I
can't.
Eh.
The
dark
gift
is
different
for
each
of
us.
But
one
thing
is
true
of
everyone.
Just
take
my
word
for
it.
She
blamed
a
slave
for
his
murder.
Imagine
what
they
did
to
him.
Evil-doers
are
easier,
and
they
taste
better.


Where
are
we
going?
Nowhere.
Now,
young
man,
you
really
amaze
me.
I'm
old
enough
to
be
your
grandmother.

Oh,
yes,
that's
the
melody.
I
remember
it.

ST.
CLAIR:
My
little
papillons.
My
butterflies,
he
killed
them!
Oh,
no!
No!

Whining
coward
of
a
vampire...
...who
prowls
killing
rats
and
poodles!
You've
condemned
me
to
hell!
I
don't
know
any
hell.


LESTAT:
Anger!
Fury!
That's
why
I
chose
you.
But
you
can't
kill
me,
Louis.
Feed...
...on
what
you
will.
Rats,
chickens,
poodles.
I'll
leave
you
to
it...
...and
watch
you
come
around.
Just
remember:
...would
be
even
more
unbearable.




Consider
yourself
lucky.
In
Paris,
a
vampire
must
be
clever...
-...for
many
reasons.
Here
all
one
needs
is
a
pair
of
fangs.
You
came
from
Paris?
As
did
the
one
who
made
me.
Tell
me
about
him.
I
learned
absolutely
nothing.
I
wasn't
given
a
choice,
remember?
You
must
know
something
Why?
Why
should
I
know
these
things?
Do
you
know
them?
That
noise...
...it's
driving
me
mad.
That
noise!
We've
been
here
for
weeks
They
know
about
us.
They
watch
us
dine
on
empty
plates
Come
to
New
Orleans,
then.
The
Paris
Opera's
in
town.
We
can
try
some
French
cuisine.
Forgive
me
if
I
have
You'll
soon
run
out
of
chickens,
Louis.

Ahem.
Monsieur
Louis?
You
don't
want
any
supper?
No,
ma
chrie.
We're
worried
about
you,
master.
When
is
it
that
you
go
riding
in
the
field?
And
how
long
since
you've
been
Everywhere
there
is
death.
Are
you
still
our
master
at
all?
That
will
be
all,
Yvette.
YVETTE:
You
must
send
away
this
friend
of
yours.
The
slaves
are
all
frightened
of
him...
...and
they
are
frightened
of
you.
LOUIS:



Hear
me
now.
This
place
is
cursed.
Damned.
And,
yes,
your
master
is
the
devil!
Get
out
while
you
can.
You're
all
free.
Do
you
hear
me?
Run!
Run!
Save
yourselves!


Perfect!
Perfect!
Just
burn
the
place!
Have
us
living
in
a
field,
like
cattle!
You
thought
you
could
have
it
all.
Shut
up,
Louis!
Come
on!
LOUIS:
Where
do
you
think,
my
idiot
friend?
We're
in
a
nice,
filthy
cemetery.
Does
this
make
you
happy?
We
belong
in
hell.
What
if
there
is
no
hell?
Or
they
don't
want
us
there?
LOUIS:
And
no
matter
where
we
moved
to,
We
rented
rooms
on
the
waterfront

WHORE:
Your
friend
has
no
head
for
wine.
Don't
worry.
I
can
warm
that
cold
skin
of
yours
Do
you
think
so?
Why...
...you're
warm
now.
But
the
price
is
high.
Your
pretty
friend,
I
exhausted
her.
Soft.
So
soft.
I
can
see
you
lying
on
a
bed
of
satin.
Such
things
you
say.
Do
you
know
what
manner
of
bed?

LESTAT:
And
then
put
out
the
light.


But
once
put
out
thy
light...
...l
cannot...
...give
it
vital
breath
again.
It
needs
must
wither.
For
you,
Louis.
You
can
pretend
it's
wine.

-She's
not
dead.
You
resist
what
can
bring
you
peace.
You
call
this
peace?
We're
predators,
whose
all-seeing
eyes
-The
girl,
Lestat!
No!

LESTAT:
Shh.
You're
tired,
you
want
to
sleep!

WHORE:
A
coffin!
Let
me
out!
I'm
not
dead!
It's
your
coffin,
enjoy
it.
Most
of
us
Why
do
you
do
this?
I
like
to
do
it.
I
enjoy
it.
Take
your
aesthete's
taste
to
purer
things.
Kill
them
swiftly
if
you
will,
but
do
it!
For
do
not
doubt
you
are
a
killer!

-What's
that,
my
love?
Oh.
So
it
is.
You
must
be
dead.
-I'm
not
dead,
am
I?
You're
not
dead.
Not
yet.
-You
finish
this.
Finish
this
now!
WHORE:
Save
me!
You'll
let
me
go?
I
can't
die
like
this.
I
need
a
priest.
My
friend
is
a
priest.
Unless
I
make
her
one
of
us.
-No!
End
her
suffering.
End
yours!
No.
LESTAT:
...are
you
happy,
Louis?
My
God.
To
think
you
are
all
I
have
to
learn
from.
LESTAT:
...they
called
it
the
"dark
gift."
And
I
gave
it
to
you.
Don't
go
that
way,
monsieur.
-Go
back
the
way
you
came.
GIRL:
Please
help
us.
Papa
left
us
and
didn't
come
back.
Please,
wake
Mama,
monsieur.


My
philosopher.
My
martyr.
"Never
take
a
human
life."
Oh,
yes.
This
calls
for
a
celebration.

There's
still
life
in
the
old
lady
yet!
Come
back!
You
are
what
you
are!
Merciful
death.
How
you
love
your
precious
guilt.
LOUIS:
Her
blood
coursed
through
my
veins
And,
as
it
did,
Lestat's
words
I
knew
peace
only
when
I
killed.
When
I
heard
her
heart
...I
knew
what
peace
could
be.

All
I
need
to
find
you,
Louis,
Pain
is
terrible
for
you.
You
feel
it
like
no
other
creature,
You
don't
want
it
to
go
on.
No.
Then
do
what
it
is
in
your
nature
to
do...
...and
you
will
feel
as
you
felt
Evil
is
a
point
of
view.
God
kills
indiscriminately...
...and
so
shall
we.
For
no
creatures
under
God
are
as
we
are.
...as
ourselves.
I
have
a
gift
for
you.
Come.
Please.
-She's
here.
You
need...
...company...
...more
congenial
than
mine.
Remember
how
you
wanted
her?
The
taste
of
her?
I
thought
l'd
killed
her.
Don't
worry.
Your
conscience
is
clear.
Claudia.
Yes.
Listen
to
me.
You're
ill,
my
precious.
And
l'm
going
to
give
you
No.
You
want
her
to
die,
then?
That's
it.
Yes.

Stop.
Stop!
Enough!

I
want
some
more.
LESTAT:


LESTAT:
They're
so
innocent.
They
must
not
be
made
to
suffer.
Good.
Yes.
All
right,
now.
Stop.
Ah-ah-ah.
That's
enough,
chrie.
You
must
stop
before
the
heart
stops.
-I
want
some
more.
But
it's
best
in
the
beginning,
You've
done
very
well.
Look
at
you.
Not
a
drop
spilt.
Very
good.
Where
is
Mama?
Mama.
Mama's
gone
to
heaven,
chrie...
...like
that
sweet
lady,
right
there.
They
all
go
to
heaven.
-All
but
us.
Do
you
want
to
frighten
our
daughter?
I'm
not
your
daughter.
Oh,
yes,
you
are.
You're
my
and
Louis'
daughter
now.
You
see,
Louis
was
going
to
leave
us.
He
was
going
to
go
away.
But
now
he's
not.
Now
he's
going
to
stay
Louis.
You
fiend.
One
happy
family.
He
did
it
to
make
you
stay
with
him?
Perhaps.
He
knew
me.
He
knew
I
would
love
her
more
LOUIS:
He
lavished
affection
on
her,
Perhaps,
in
the
end,
Monsieur!
I
need
more
light.
-I'll
go
blind
without
another
lamp.
Or
let
me
fit
this
child
during
the
day.
I
am
afraid,
madame,
LOUIS:
But
also
a
fierce
killer...
...now
capable
of
the
ruthless
pursuit

CLAUDlA:

Claudia.
Claudia!
Now...
...who
will
we
get
to
finish
your
dress?
Remember,
never
in
our
home.
LOUIS:
...curling
her
little
fingers
around
my
hair...
...till
the
day
came
when
she
wanted
But
still,
whenever
she
awoke...
...she
would
crawl
into
mine.
They
died
fast
in
those
days,
...to
delay
the
moment
till
she
had
taken

Why
are
you
crying,
child?
Are
you
lost,
my
love?
-Mama!
Hush,
now,
don't
cry.
-We'll
find
her.
Mind
the
thumb,
girl.
That
little
digit.
They're
expensive,
my
dear.
Maybe
too
expensive...
...for
a
young
girl
like
you.
Claudia!
What
have
we
told
you?
Never
in
the
house.
Give
me
some
room.
LOUIS:
But
to
Lestat,
a
pupil...
...an
infant
prodigy,
with
a
lust
for
killing
Together,
they
finished
off
whole
families.
Wonderful,
wonderful.
Now
try
something
LOUIS:
Time
can
pass
quickly
for
mortals
With
us,
it
was
the
same.
The
years
flew
by
like
minutes.
Sailboats
gave
way
to
steamships...
...disgorging
an
endless
menu
A
new
world
had
sprung
up
around
us.
And
we
were
all
Americans
now.
This
filthy
modern
tide.
What
I
wouldn't
give
for
a
drop
Yankees
are
not
to
your
taste?
Their
Democratic
flavor...
...doesn't
suit
my
palate,
Louis.

Now,
that
is
pure
Creole.
Trust
Claudia
to
have
found
her.
What?
Don't
you
want
her?
I
want
to
be
her.
Can
l,
Louis?
Mon
dieu.
More
melancholy
nonsense.
You
grow
more
like
Louis
every
day.
Rats?
When
did
you
eat
rats,
Louis?
It
was
a
long,
long
time
ago.
Before
you
were
born.

And
I
don't
recommend
them.
LOUIS:
Thirty
years
had
passed,
yet
Her
eyes
alone
told
the
story
of
her
age,
...with
a
questioning

Another
doll.
I
have
dozens,
you
realize.
I
thought
you
could
use
one
more.
CLAUDlA:
What
do
you
mean?
You
always
give
me
a
doll
Oh.
I
didn't
realize.
CLAUDlA:
You
dress
me
like
a
doll.
You
make
my
hair
like
a
doll.
Why?
Some
of
these,
Claudia,
are
so
old...
...tattered.
-You
should
throw
them
away.
Claudia.
Claudia.
Claudia!
What
have
you
done?
What
you
told
me
to
do!
-You
leave
a
corpse
here
to
rot?
I
wanted
to
be
her!
LESTAT:
She
pollutes
the
very
house
we
live
in!
Do
you
want
me
to
be
a
doll
forever?
LOUIS:
Why
not?
Can't
I
change...
...like
everyone
else?

Which
one
of
you
did
it?
Which
one
of
you
made
me
the
way
I
am?
What
you
are?
A
vampire
gone
insane,
And
if
I
cut
my
hair
again?
It
will
grow
back
again.
CLAUDlA:
I
had
a
mother
once.
He
was
mortal,
same
as
she.
-And
so
was
l!
You
made
us
what
we
are,
-Stop
her,
Louis.

How
did
you
do
it?
And
why
should
I
tell
you?
It's
in
my
power.
Why
yours
alone?
Tell
me
how
it
was
done.
Be
glad
I
made
you
what
you
are.
You'd
be
dead
now
if
I
hadn't.
Like
that
damned
corpse.
Now
get
rid
of
it!
You
get
rid
of
it.
Louis,
why?
You've
got
to
tell
me.

LOUIS:
That
will
never
happen
to
you.
You
will
never
grow
old.
And
you
will
never
die.
And
it
means
something
else
too,
I
shall
never,
ever
grow
up.
I
hate
him.
Tell
me
how
it
came
to
be
that
I
am
this...
...thing.
LOUIS:
Yet
I
found
my
way
back
there...
...with
hardly
an
upward
glance.
You
fed
on
me?
Yes.
And
he
found
me
with
you.
Then
he
cut
his
wrist
...and
you
were
a
vampire
then...
...and
have
been
every
night
thereafter.
You
both
did
it.
I
took
your
life.
He
gave
you
another
one.
And
here
it
is.
And
I
hate
you
both.
LOUIS:
I
walked
as
I
walked
years
before...
...when
my
mind
swam
with
guilt
I
thought
of
all
the
things
I
had
done
And
I
longed
for
one
second's
peace.
Locked
together
in
hatred.
But
I
can't
hate
you,
Louis.
Louis,
my
love.
I
was
mortal
till
you...
...gave
me
your
immortal
kiss.
You
became
my
mother
and
my
father.
And
so
I'm
yours
forever.
But
now
it's
time
to
end
it,
Louis.
Now
it's
time
to
leave
him.
He
will
never
let
us
go.
Oh.
Really?

What
is
it
now?
You
irritate
me.
...irritates
me.
Does
it?
I
found
someone
who'll
be
a
vampire
Is
that
supposed
to
frighten
me?
You're
spoiled,
You
need
a
brother.
Or
I
do.
I'm
weary
of
you
both.
I
suppose
we
could
people
...the
three
of
us.
Oh,
not
you,
my
little
Claudia.
You're
a
liar.
But
you
upset
my
plans.
What
plans?
CLAUDlA:
Even
though
you're
the
father
of
lies...
...l
want
things
to
be
as
they
were.
Stop
pestering
me,
then.
Oh,
Lestat,
I
must
do
more
than
that.
I've
brought
a
present
for
you.
Oh.
Then
I
hope
it's
a
beautiful
woman...
...with
endowments
you'll
never
possess.
Why
do
you
say
such
things?
You
haven't
fed
enough.
I
can
tell
by
your
color.
Come
and
see.
Don't
be
angry
with
me.
When
I
saw
them,
Drunk...
...on
brandywine.
A
thimbleful.
Claudia,
Claudia,
Claudia.
Well,
you
certainly
have...
...outdone
yourself.
I
promise
I'll
get
rid
of
the
bodies.
We
forgive
each
other,
then?
Yes.
Absinthe?

You've
given
them
absinthe?
No.
Laudanum.
Laudanum?
Yes.
It
killed
them,
unfortunately.
But
it
keeps
the
blood
warm.
You
let
me
drink...
...dead
blood?
You
let
me...
...drink....
One
lesson
you
taught
me...
...never
drink
from
the
dead.
Louis!
Put
me
in
my
coffin.
Put
me
in
my
coffin.
CLAUDlA:

My
God!
Louis,
lift
me
up.
Good
night,
sweet
prince.
May
flights
of
devils
wing
you
to
your
rest.
Should
we
burn
him?
Bury
him?
What
would
he
have
liked?
The
swamp?
He
belongs
with
those
reptiles.
He
deserved
to
die.
Then
perhaps
so
do
we,
He
was
my
maker.
He
gave
me
this
life...
...whatever
it
is.
It
shouldn't
have
been
this
way.
CLAUDlA:
So
we
could
be
free.
You
missed
him?
He
was
all
I
knew.
We
were
like
two
orphans
We
booked
passage
to
Europe.
LOUIS:
Over
the
weeks,
...she
studied
the
myths
and
...obsessed
with
the
search
for


Look
who
we
forgot.
Let's
set
them
free.
-Yes.

It's
the
carriage.

No!
Louis!

LESTAT:
...there's
life
in
these
old
hands
still.
Not
quite
furioso.
Moderato...
...cantabile,
perhaps.
How
could
it
be?
LESTAT:
His
blood
helped.
Then,
on
a
diet
of
the
blood
of
snakes...
...toads...
...and
all
the
putrid
life
of
the
Mississippi...
...slowly...
...Lestat
became
something
Claudia...
...you've
been...
...a
very...
...very...
...naughty
little
girl.




[LESTAT
SCREAMlNG
The
ship
is
sailing
without
us!
LOUIS:
...I
stood
on
that
deck
...from
the
river
like
some
monster,
And
all
the
while
I
thought:
"Lestat...
...we
deserve
your
vengeance.
You
gave
me
the
'dark
gift'...
...and
I
delivered
you
into
the
hands
Though
the
ship
was
...a
strange
plague
nonetheless
Claudia
and
I
alone
seemed
immune.
We
kept
to
ourselves...
...pondering
the
mystery
of
each
other.
We
reached
the
Mediterranean.
I
wanted
those
waters
to
be
blue,
And
how
I
suffered
then...
...straining
to
recall
the
color
We
searched
village
after
village...
...ruin
after
ruin...
...country
after
country.
And
always
we
found
nothing.
I
began
to
believe
we
were
the
only
ones.
There
was
a
strange
comfort
For
what
could
the
damned
-You
said
you
found
nothing?
...superstitions
about
garlic...
...crosses...
...the
old
stake
in
the
heart.
But
one
of
our
kind?
Not
a
whisper.
There
are
no
vampires
in
Transylvania?
LOUIS:
The
vulgar
fictions
of
a
demented
lrishman.
LOUIS:
The
city
I'd
always
dreamed
of.
I
was
Creole,
after
all,
A
universe
whole
and
entire
unto
herself.
LOUIS:
Just
the
two
of
us.
And
so
euphoric
was
I
So
it
was...
...when
I'd
given
up
...that
a
vampire
found
me.
LOUIS:
ARMAND:
I've
searched
the
world
for
an
immortal
ARMAND:
No
one
will
harm
you.
And,
uh...
...remember
my
name:
Armand.
LOUIS:
They
have
different
powers.

He's
the
one,
that's
the
vampire.
Two
lovers...
...wandering
down
their
violet
way...
...whose
passionate
embraces,
...permit
no
meditations
on
decay...

...until
they
find
themselves



Vampires
who
pretend
to
be
humans
How
avant-garde.
The
monk
whose
soul
...and
spends
his
days

...finds
he
will
meet
his
maker
all
too
soon.
For
all
his
prayers
gets
no
remuneration.
The
lesson
endeth
here...
...and
it
is
this:
Each
one
of
you
Each
one
must
bend
But,
hark.
Methinks
a
mortal
doth
approach.
What
have
we
here?
What
beauty
by
my
side?
A
rose
in
bloom,
a
shrinking
violet?

Perhaps
she
has
a
mind
to
be
my
bride.
Perhaps
my
lesson
has
not
ended
yet.
GIRL:
I
don't
want
to
die!
SANTIAGO:
...and
have
always
been.
GIRL:
Please!
No!
Aah!
What
have
I
done?
SANTIAGO:
We
all
die!
Death
is
no
respecter
of
age.
Just
as
this
flesh
is
pink
now...
...so
it
will
turn
gray
and
wrinkle
with
age.
Let
me
live!
I
don't
care!
Then
why
should
you
care
if
you
die
now?
And
suppose
Death
had
a
heart
To
whom
would
he
turn
his
passion?
Would
you
choose
a
person
A
person
to
suffer
as
you
suffer?
Oh,
yes.
I
adore
you!
SANTIAGO:
Well....
Do
you
know
what
it
means
To
become
our
bride?



No
pain.
Monstrous.

ARMAND:
Let
me
show
you.
LOUIS:
ARMAND:
But
very
beautiful.
Welcome
to
my
home.
Try
him.

Two
vampires...
...from
the
New
World...
...come
to
guide
us
into
the
new
era...
...as
all
we
love
slowly
rots...
...and
fades
away.
Are
you
the
leader
of
this
group?
If
there
were
a
leader...
...l
would
be
the
one.
-So
you
have
the
answers?
What
are
we?
Nothing...
...if
not
vampires.
LOUIS:
Surely
you
know
the
one
who
made
you?
LOUIS:
The
source...
...of
all
this...
...evil.
I
understand.
I
saw
you
in
the
theater.
Your
suffering...
...your
sympathy
for
that
girl.
You
die...
...when
you
kill.
You
feel
you
deserve
to
die
But
does
that
make
you
evil?
Since
you
comprehend
...doesn't
that
make
you
good?
Then
there
is
nothing?
ARMAND:
But
perhaps...
...this...
...is
the
only
real
evil
left.
Then
God
does
not
exist?
I
know
nothing
of
God.
Or
the
devil.
I
have
never
seen
a
vision,
...that
would
damn
or
save
my
soul.
As
far
as
I
know...
...after
400
years...
...l
am
the
oldest
living
vampire...
...in
the
world.
Then
it's
as
I
always
feared.
You
fear
too
much.
So
much
you
make
me
fear....
The
one
who
made
you...
...should
have
told
you
this.
The
one
who
left
the
Old
World
LOUIS:
The
one
who
made
us
Knew?
Come,
beloved.
It's
time
we
were
on
our
way.
I'm
hungry
and
the
city
awaits.
LOUIS:
Silent
as
the
grave.
And
as
we
blundered
through
it,
"I
have
wronged
Lestat.
I
have
hated
him
for
the
wrong
reasons."
SANTIAGO:
You
said
a
name.
Yes,
a
name
I
don't
care
to
say
again.
SANTIAGO:
There
is
but
one
crime
It
is
the
crime
that
means
death
To
kill
your
own
kind.
-Do
you
think
I'd
let
them
harm
you?
Danger
holds
you
to
me.
Love
holds
you
to
me.
-Love?
You
would
leave
me
for
Armand
Never.
CLAUDlA:
He
wants
you
as
you
want
him.
He
wants
you
as
a
companion.
-He
finds
it
as
dull
and
lifeless
as
we
do.
Do
you
know
what
his
soul
said
to
me
"Let
him
go,"
he
said.
"Let
him
go."
Is
that
what
I
should
do?
Let
you
go?
My
father...
...my
Louis,
who
made
me?
It
will
be
all
right.
You
really
believe
that?
The
soldier,
on
returning
from
the
war...
...thinks
victory
has
inured
him
...till
Death
comes
by...
...and
chops
him
from
his
horse.

I
was
waiting
for
you.
Listen
to
me.
Claudia
is
very
dear
to
me.
She's
my
daughter.
Your
lover.
No,
my
beloved.
My
child.
You
say
so.
You're
innocent.
She's
in
danger,
isn't
she?
-She
is.
ARMAND:
Her
silence.
Her
youth.
It's
forbidden
to
make
one
so
young...
...so
helpless...
...that
cannot
survive
on
its
own.
LOUIS:
Did
you
kill
this
vampire
Is
that
why
you
won't
say
his
name?
-We
want
no
quarrel
with
him.
If
you
want
to
save
her,
send
her
away.
Then
I
leave
too.
So
soon?
Without
any
of
those
answers
-You
said
there
were
none.
Do
you
know...
...how
few
vampires...
...have
the
stamina
for
immortality?
How
quickly
they
perish
of
their
own
will.
The
world...
...changes.
We
do
not.
Therein
lies
the
irony
that
finally
kills
us.
I
need
you
to
make
contact
with
this
age.
Me?
Don't
you
see?
I'm
not
the
spirit
of
any
age.
I'm
at
odds
with
everything.
I
always
have
been.
That
is
the
very
spirit
of
your
age.
The
heart
of
it.
Your
fall
from
grace...
...has
been
the
fall
of
a
century.
But
the
vampires
in
the
theater?
ARMAND:
...useless.
They
can't
reflect
anything.
But...
...you
do.
You
reflect...
...its
broken
heart.
A
vampire...
...with
a
human
soul.
An
immortal
with
a
mortal's
passion.
You...
...are...
...beautiful,
my
friend.
Lestat
must
have
wept
when
he
made
you.
Lestat?
You
knew
Lestat?
Yes.
I
knew
him.
Knew
him
well
enough
LOUIS:
I
had
found
the
teacher
which
Lestat
I
knew
knowledge
would
It
would
pass
through
him
CLAUDlA:
...Louis
is
shy.
MADELEINE:
Drink.
Do
it,
Louis.
Because
I
cannot
do
it.
You
saw
to
that
when
you
made
me.
You
haven't
the
vaguest
conception

I
have.
You
have
found
your
new
companion!
How
do
we
seem
to
you?
Do
you
find
us
beautiful?
Magical?
Our
white
skin,
our
fierce
eyes?
"Drink,"
you
ask
me.
Your
evil
is
that
you
cannot
be
evil.
And
I
shall
suffer
for
it
no
longer!
Don't
make
me
do
this.
I
cannot!
Yet,
you
could
do
it
to
me.
Snatching
me
from
my
mother's
hands,
And
now
you
weep.
I
haven't
tears
enough
You
give
her
to
me,
Louis!
Do
this
before
you
leave
me!
Oh,
God.
I
love
you
still.
That's
the
torment
of
it.
Who'll
care
for
me,
my
love...
...my
dark
angel,
when
you
are
gone?
What
do
you
think
she
is,
Madeleine?
A
doll?
A
child
who
cannot
die.
And
the
child
who
did
die?
MADELEINE:


CLAUDlA:
She's
dying.
It
happened
to
you
too...
...only
you
were
too
young
to
remember.
But
if
she
dies?
It's
only
mortal
death.
Bear
me
no
ill
will,
my
love.
We
are
now
even.
What
do
you
mean?
What
died
in
that
room
What
has
died
is
the...
...last
breath
in
me...
...that
was
human.
Yes,
Father.
At
last
we
are
even.
It's
time
for
justice,
little
one.


Get
me
Armand.
Death
for
the
others.
For
you...
...eternity
in
a
box.

Walled
in
a
dungeon,
Perhaps
it
will
take
centuries.
Take
them!
LOUIS:
Armand!
Armand!
Armand!
Claudia!
Armand!
Armand!


Pleasant
dreams.
LOUIS:
Help!
Madeleine.
Wake
up.



Claudia!

Where's
Claudia?
Claudia.
I
cannot
help
her.
-Where's
Claudia?
I
will
only
risk
losing
you!
Louis,
don't!

Come,
Louis.
Not
here.
MALLOY:
Once...
...maybe
twice,
in
eternity.
And
maybe
it
was...
...to
quench
those
tears
forever
Stop
him!
lt's
burning!
Get
him!





Louis!
You
didn't
even
warn
them,
did
you?
No.
And
you
knew
what
I
would
do.
I
knew.
I
rescued
you,
didn't
l?
From
the
terrible
dawn.
You
were
their
leader.
They
trusted
you.
You
made
me
see
their
failings,
Louis.
They
were
doomed...
...stuck
in
their
decadent
time.
They
had
forgotten
the
first
lesson...
...that
we
must
be
powerful...
...beautiful...
...and
without
regret.
And
you
can
teach
me
this?
Yes.
-To
be
without
regret?
Then,
what
a
pair
we
could
make.

But
what
if
it's
a
lesson
What
do
you
mean?
What
if
all
I
have
is
my
suffering?
My
regret?
ARMAND:
LOUIS:
The
heart
that
mourns
her...
...her
that
you
burnt
to
a
cinder?
Louis,
I
swear
I
didn't--
Ah,
but
I
know
you
did.
I
know...
...you...
...regret
nothing.
You
feel...
...nothing.
If
that's
all
I
have
left
to
learn...
...l
can
do
that
on
my
own.
-Louis.
I
will
die.
No.
You
are
dead.
And
you
want
me
to
quicken
you
And
as
much
as
your
invitation
...l
must
regretfully
decline.
LOUIS:
Italy,
Greece...
...all
the
ancient
lands.
But
the
world
was
a
tomb
to
me...
...a
graveyard
full
of
broken
statues.
And
each
of
those
statues
Then,
out
of
curiosity,
boredom,
...I
left
the
Old
World
And
there
a
mechanical
wonder
...for
the
first
time...
...in
200
years.
And
what
sunrises!
Seen
as
the
human
eye
Silver
at
first...
...then,
as
the
years
progressed,
...and
my
long-lost
blue.
In
the
spring
of
1988,
And
as
soon
as
I
smelled
the
air,
It
was
rich,
almost
sweet...
...like
the
fragrance
of
jasmine
and
roses
I
walked
the
streets
savoring

And
then
on
Prytania
Street...
...only
blocks
from
...I
caught
the
scent
of
death.

And
it
wasn't
coming
from
the
graves.
The
scent
grew
stronger
as
I
walked.
Old
death.
A
scent
too
faint
for
mortals
to
detect.

LESTAT:
I'm
so
glad
you
are
here.
I've
dreamed...
...of
this
moment.
She
never
should
have
been
one
of...
...us.
That's
all
past,
Lestat.
Yeah.
Past.
Still
beautiful,
Louis.
You
always
were
the
strong
one.
Don't
be
frightened.
I
mean
you
no
harm.
You've
come
home
to
me,
then?
You
remember
how
I
was?
The
vampire
that
I
was?
Yes,
I
remember.
LESTAT:
No
one
could
refuse
me...
...not
even
you.
I
tried.
Yes,
you
tried.
And
the
more
you
tried,
heh-heh...
...the
more
I
wanted
you.


LESTAT:
Such
lights...
...and
that
noise!
They
make
the
night
brighter
than
the
day.
LOUIS:
It's
false
light.
It
can't
harm
you.
If
you
stay
with
me,
Louis...
...l
could
venture
out
again.
Become
the
old
Lestat.
I
must
leave
now.
Whatever
happened
to
Lestat,
I
go
on
night
after
night.
I
feed
on
those
who
cross
my
path.
But
all
my
passion
went
I'm
a
spirit
of
preternatural
flesh.
Detached.
Unchangeable.
Empty.
Empty?
That's
it?
No,
it
can't
end
like
that.
But
it
has.
There's
no
more
to
tell.
There
has
to
be
more
to
tell.
You
don't
understand
yourself.
What
I
wouldn't
give
to
be
like
you,
...to
have
seen
the
things
you
have
seen.
You
haven't
been
listening.
I
have
been
listening.
Your
story
Do
what
you
want
with
it.
There's
only
one
way
I'll
truly
learn
Now,
you
brought
me
here
for
a
reason,
What
reason
would
that
be?
You
want
a
companion.
You
want
a
link
to
the
outside
world.
Take
me.
That's
what
I
want.
-I
refuse
to
let
it
end
like
this.
You
haven't
failed.

Do
you
like
this?
Do
you
like
being
food
for
the
immortals?
Do
you
like
dying?
Stop!

LOUIS
:
I
was
24.
Younger
than
you
are
now.
But
times
were
different
then.
The
master
of
a
large
plantation,
I
had
lost
my
wife
in
childbirth.
Somebody
change
my
shorts.
She
and
the
infant
had
been
buried
It's
good
stuff.
I
would've
been
happy
to
join
them.
Good
stuff.

I
assume
I
need
no
introduction.

I
feel
better
already.
LOUIS
:
I
invited
it.
A
release
from
the
pain
of
living.
Oh,
Louis,
Louis.
Still
whining,
Louis.
Have
you
heard
enough?
I've
had
to
listen
to
that
for
centuries.
[GUNS
N'
ROSES'
LESTAT:
I'm
going
to
give
you
the
choice...
...l
never
had.
