I'll
be
here

How's

-
Yeah,
that'll
do.
-
Take
it
easy.
Hey,
Helen.
Helen!
Helen!
-
What?
-
What?
-
What?
-
No!
-
He
can't
do
that!
Where's
Sue?
-
What's
she
gonna
wear?
A
sackcloth?

-
Keep
those
stars
comin'
faster.

What's
this
about
Tommy
Whatever
you
heard,
it's
true.
Why's
he
doing
it?
I
asked
him
to
-
Where's
that
put
everybody
else?
-
What
do
you
mean?
-
Well,
you're
not
goin'
to
the
prom.
You'll
be
here?
You're
goin'
to
the
prom?
Shut
up.
I
will
tell
you
later.
I'm
gonna
be
in
on
it?
What?
I'll
tell
you
later!
-
I
want
to
know
now,
Chris.
Can't
you
give
me
a
hint?
I
won't
tell
-
Come
on.
-
You
gotta
rent
a
tuxedo
for
the
prom.
Ten
bucks,
you
can
rent
one!

-
Does
this
look
nice?
Make
a
good
impression
for
once.
-
Would
you
go
out
with
me?
You
don't
have
to
get
them
for
yourself.
-
I
just
don't
like
ruffles.
Don't
I
look
sharp?
It
looks
good
on
you,

-
Have
you
ever
put
on
a
tuxedo?

-
I
know
they
have
tuxedos
here
for
you.
I
know
just
the
tuxedo
for
him.
Well,
what
do
you
think?
-
I
like
it.
I
think
it's
terrific.
Red.
I
might've
known
it
would
be
red.
It's
pink,
Mama.
What
Tommy
gave
me,
Mama.
I
can
see
your
dirty
pillows.
Everyone
will.
Breasts,
Mama.
They're
called
breasts.
Take
offthat
dress.
-
No.
-
No,
Mama.

-
Well,
he's
not
comin'.
I'm
nervous
enough.
No,
he's
not
coming.
He's
not
gonna
come.
Go
away!
Stop
it,
Mama!
-
Stop
hurting
yourself,
Mama!
He's
gonna
laugh
at
you!
-
No,
they're
not.
I
don't
wanna
stay
with
you,
Mama!
I'll
tell
him
you're
sick!
-
I'll
tell
him
you
changed
your
mind!
Sit
down!
Be
quiet!

-
I'll
tell
him
that
you
changed
your
mind.
Just
sit
there,
Mama,
I'll
be
home
early.
I
love
you,
Mama.

Tommy...
Could
we
wait
here
just
a
minute?
-
Are
you
scared?
-
Maybe
this
was
a
mistake.
They're
a
good
crowd.
Really.
Really.
Don't
be
so
nervous.
Besides,
I'd
look
awfully
stupid
Now
come
on.

As
I
look
back
upon
my
younger
days

I'd
Don't
bother
about
them.
Where
did
you
buy
that
dress?
I
love
it!
-
Oh,
I
made
it.
-
The
decorations...
don't
they
look
great?
-
I'm
so
nervous.
-
Hey,
what
time
is
it?
-
Where
are
you
going?
-
See
you
later.

-
Would
you
like
to
dance?
Oh,
sure.
Sure,
anything
you
want.
Carrie.
Hi,
Miss
Collins.
-
You
look
so
pretty!
Thank
you!
I
know
I
don't,
not
really,
-
May
I
sit
down?
I'm
gonna
go
and
talk
to
some
people.
I
remember
my
prom.
I
had
a
date
with
the
captain
And
he
was
six
feet
seven
inches
tall,
so...
...I
bought
a
pair
ofthree-inch
heels
so
our
So
anyway,
we
went
...which
of
course
broke
down,
and
we
By
the
time
I
got
there,
my
feet
were
so
I
couldn't
dance.
And...
it
was
magic.
Is
it
like
thatfor
you?
It's,
um...
-
It's
nice.
No.
It's...
It's
like,
uh...
-
It's
like
bein'
on
Mars.
I
don't
think
I
will.
Thank
you.
Hey,
what's
goin'
on
here?
-
Well,
we
were
just
talking.
Have
a
lovely
time,
OK?
And
you
too!
Bye.
Don't
let
me
catch
you
-
I
won't.
I
won't.
Do
you
really
have
to
be
home
so
early?
Yeah,
I
promised.
OK.
-
Sorry.
Um...
Some
ofthe
kids
are
going
-
That's
OK.
If
you
wanna
go
with
your
friends,
Would
you
let
me
finish?
...is
that,
if
you'd
like
to,
we
could
stop
in
-
I've
never
been
there.
Good!
Well,
then,
let's
go!
-
OK.
Are
you
ready
to
dance?
-
Come
on.
-
Come
on.
-
I
can't,
Tommy.
I
can't.

"
I'm
not
sure

the
more
that
it's
real

more
it's
right

me
at

at
me

As
though
I'm
beautiful
You
can.
Come
on.
Gimme
your
hand.
Put
it
there.

Like
that?

Like
that?
All
right?
OK.
Just...
listen
to
the
music.
That's
right.
See,
you
got
it.
That's
good.
You're
as
good
as
anyone
else
out
here.
You
got
it.
-
I'm
sorry.
-
It's
just...
No
harm.
No
foul.
-
I
can't
do
anything.
I
can't
dance.
I
can't
even...
I
don't
know.
-
Tommy?
Why...
-
Why
what?
Because
it's
the
prom.
Why
am
I
here
with
you?
Because...
I
asked
you.
-
Why'd
you
ask
me?
Why'd
you
want
to?
Because
you
liked
my
poem.
Only
I
didn't
write
it.
Somebody
else
did.
Oh.
Carrie,
we're
here...
...and
we're
together...
...and
I
like
it...

I
do,
I
like
it!

But
tonight
there's
only
me

I
never
dreamed
someone
like
you

Could
love
someone
like
me

ladies
and
gentlemen!

your
picture
so
everyone

Anyway,

the
last
year.
Why

Hey.
You're
beautiful.
Well,

vote
for?
I
don't

have
a
crowd.
Let's
vote
for
ourselves.

No.
Please
don't
vote
for
ourselves.
Carrie...
Come

To
the
devil
with
false
modesty.

I
believed
him.

never
dies.
Sin
never
dies.
Atfirst
it
was
all
right.
We
lived
sinlessly.
We
slept
in
the
same
bed,
And
then,
that
night...
I
saw
him
looking
down
at
me
that
way.
We
got
down
on
our
knees
I
smelt
the
whisky
on
his
breath.
And
he
took
me...
He
took
me...
...with
the
stink
ofthe
filthy
And
I
liked
it.
I
liked
it!
With
all
that
dirty
touchin'
...I
should
have
given
you
to
God
But
I
was
weak
and
backsliding.
And
now
the
devil
has
come
home.

We'll
pray.
We'll
pray.
We'll
pray.
We'll
pray.
For
the
last
time,
we'll
pray.
Our
Father,
who
art
in
heaven,
...thy
kingdom
come,
thy
will
be
done...

don't
think
I
could've

We're
all
a
little
edgy.
She's
better.
Well...
...but
Dr
Schneider

Well,
he
said
that
she's
young

No.
I
wouldn't

the
funerals.
