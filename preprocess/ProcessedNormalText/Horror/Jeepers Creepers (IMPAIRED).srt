"Beating

Well,
I
don't.
I
don't
like
knowing
this,
You
said
it
eats?
Only
certain
things...
...from
certain
people.
It
eats
lungs
so
it
can
breathe...
...and
eyes
so
it
can
see.
It
all
becomes
a
part
of
it.
Whatever
it
eats...
It
dresses
like
a
man...
...but
only
to
hide
that
it's
not.

-
out
there
on
the
road...
...but
only
as
much
as
it
can
be
hurt.
'Cause
it
can
keep
on
eating


You've
got
something
it

And
it's
not
gonna
stop
chasing
you

How?
How
does
it
find
out,
It
needs
to
scare
you.
There's
something
in
fear,
Something
that
tells

that
it
might...
