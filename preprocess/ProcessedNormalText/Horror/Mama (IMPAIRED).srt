Well,
just
let
me
warn
you.
We're
very
fortunate,
that
Victoria
was
But
it's
still
too
early
to
determine
That's
a
different
story.
Shit.
Oh,
yeah.
Hey,
Victoria.
Is
that
you,
Lilly?
No,
no,
no.
It's
okay.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
I
brought
something
for
you.
When
you
were
a
little
girl.
I
was
going
to
put..
That's
okay.
Just
going
to
put
them
here.
It's
okay.
Yeah.
That's
it.
Daddy?
Oh,

87
days
ago.
Solid,
and
outstandingly
fast.
Your
Honour,
Victoria
and
Lilly
Dosage
Isolated,
starved.
They
feared
and
distrusted
all
physical
contact.
Their
emotional
growth
was
In
order
to
survive
such
extreme
isolation,
A
parent
figure,
to
feed
them,
They
called
her:
"Mama".
Victoria
and
Lilly
have
a
real
chance
With
the

Jeffrey

murdered
And
now
his
brother
did
an
extraordinary
thing.
But
he
did
it
for
the
girls.
Not
for
himself.
he
must
know
neither
his
salary,
nor
his
very
small
-
Let
alone,
2
children
with
a
very
special
needs.
Not
as
many
as
you,
Lucas.
Of
cause
she
wants
the
girls,
Lucas.
She
can't
just
sweep
in,
and
take
them.
I'm
sure
that's
not
entirely
fair.
I'll
tell
you,
what's
not
fair.
Is
that
really
such
a
bad
thing?
-
What?
You
draw
pictures
for
a
living.
Where
do
you
live?
Do
you
have
room
for
What
are
you
saying,
Gerald?
When
it
comes
to
the
girls'
welfare..
Family
Court
judge
is
pretty
much
And
right
now,
I'll
be
lying
if
I
didn't
But
the
truth
is..
I
don't
want
them
living
on
the
other
So,
we
can
really
really
help
each
other
out

I
need
continued

I
want
you
to
tell

Can
you
tell
me
the
story?
It
was
long
time
ago,
a
lady
run
away
She
took
her
baby.
How
could
you
know
that
story,
Victoria?
Did
Mama
tell
you
that
story?
-
She
showed
me.
In
a
dream.
Go
on,
Victoria.
And
you
can't
tell
anyone
-
Nope.
Yeah,
well.
For
the
girls.
-
So
much
deplorable.
Yeah,
but
this
one
messed
up,
I
don't
even
have
the
chance
-
Leave
him.
You
don't
sign
up
for
this,
babe.
I
can't
do
that
to
him.
Mrs.
Sensitivity,

to
the
tests.
-
What
happens
now?
Those
girls
now
without
Lucas..-
Annabel,
the
girls
But
I'm
not
prepared
for
this.
I
can't
Just
follow,
if
you
not,
And
Lucas
will
be
lucky
if
he
sees
Well,
I
checked
out.
All
the
doors
and
windows

So,
I
imagined
it
then,
yeah?
-
Mama!..
Okay,
guys.
Just
you
and
me
for
a
while.
I
don't
know
how
are
you
feeling
-
How
they've
been
affected
by
all
of
this?
What
did
they
say?
Mama.
What's
this?
They
made
that.

They
found
a
doll
Who
made
the
doll?
Mama.
The
doll's
called
Mama?

Mama
made
the
doll.

Why
not?
What's
in
the
closet?
Nothing.
Okay.

You
want
me
to
leave
the
door
open?
Good

I
think
someone's
coming
to
visit
them.
I
don't

believe
that?
She
was..
singing
to
them,
You

Sound
like
this?
Yeah,
but
it
was,
it
was
different.
Victoria
is
showing
signs.
I
think

on
the
role
It's
treatable.
