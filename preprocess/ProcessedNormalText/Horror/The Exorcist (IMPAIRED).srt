How

That's

It's
okay,
I've
got
it.
Thanks.
-
Good
morning,
madam.
Oh,
Karl,
we've
got
rats
in
the
attic.
-
Rats?
But
the
attic
is
clean.
All
right,
then,
we've
got
clean
rats.
-
No,
no.
No
rats.
Maybe
plumbing.
Yeah,
or
maybe
rats.
KARL:
Don't
go
now.

I'll
go
see.

That's

Burke.
Oh,
Burke.
-
Is
this
scene
really
essential?
Just
consider
if
we
can
do
without
it.
Take
a
look
at
this
damn
thing.
It's
plain.
You're
a
teacher
of
the
college.

Come
on.
I
can
read,
for
Christ's
sake.
Well,
why

There's

I

I
don't
know
anyone
who

CHRIS:
In
here.
-
Hi.
How
did
your
day
go?
It
was
like
the,
uh,
Walt
Disney
version
Other
than
that,
terrific.
-
What
we
got,
anything
exciting?
-
Oh,
all
right.
-
What's
this?
You're
kidding.
I
think
it's
five
or
six
people.
Oh.
Thursday,
huh?
All
right.
REGAN:
CHRIS:
-
Stuff.
Well,
uh,
me
and
Sharon
played
a
game
-
You
did.
CHRIS:
You
should
have
seen.
This
man
came
along
on
this
-
Really?
What
kind?
Was
it
a
mare,
a
gelding,
what?
-
I
think
it
was
a
gelding.
It
was
gray.
Oh,
it
was
so
beautiful.
The
guy
let
me
ride
it
all
around
-
You're
kidding.
It
was
so
nice.
Oh,
I
loved
it.
-
Not
while
we're
in
Washington,
honey.
We'll
see
when
we
get
home,
okay?
-
When
could
I
have
one?
Hey,
listen,
on
the
party
invitations,
-
Regan,
don't!
Regan,
come
back
here!

CHRIS:
All
right,
give
it
up.
Give
it
up!
CHRIS:
Ooh!
-
You'll
be
sorry!
Come
on.

Could
you

Dimmy!

Oh,
how
are
you,
Mama?

I'm
so
glad
to
see
you.
I'm
all
right.
-
How's
your
leg?
I'm
fine,
Mama.
I'm
fine.

Your
Uncle
John
passed
by
to
visit
me.
KARRAS:
Oh,
really?
When?
-
Too
tight?
You
have
to
stay
off
it.
You
can't
go
up
and
Okay.

I
could
take
you
somewhere
where
There
would
be
people
around.
You

You
understand
me?
This
is
my
house

Dimmy,
you
worry
for
something?
-
No,
Mama.
Tell
me,
what
is
the
matter?
Mama,
I'm
all
right.
I'm
fine.

Here
it
comes.
There.

-
Oh,
look
at
that.
Aw,
isn't
that
funny?
Ha,
ha.
I
better
put
him
over
here
to
dry,
though.
Oh,
here
we
go.
There,
he
can
dry
there.
Hey,
where'd
this
come
from?
-
I
found
it.
Closet.
Huh.
You
been
playing
with
it?
-
Yup.
I'll
show
you.
Wait
a
minute.
You
need
two.
No,
you
don't.
I
do
it
all
the
time.
Oh,
yeah?
Well,
let's
both
play
with
it.
You
really
don't
want
me
to
play,
huh?
No,
I
do.
Captain
Howdy
said
no.
-
Captain
who?
Who's
Captain
Howdy?
You
know.
I
make
the
questions
-
Oh,
Captain
Howdy.
Yeah,
I
see.
Oh,
I'll
bet
he
is.
-
Here,
I'll
show
you.
Captain
Howdy,
Captain
Howdy?
Captain
Howdy,
that
isn't
very
nice.
-
Well,
maybe
he's
sleeping.
Regan,
why
are
you
reading
that
stuff?
Because
I
like
it.
It's
not
even
a
good
picture
of
you.
-
You
look
so
mature.
You
wouldn't
talk?
I
didn't
have
my
makeup
man
there.
Let
me
take
an
eyelash
off
your
face.
Okay.
No,
I
didn't
get
it.
-
Mm.
Isn't
it
nice
it's
on
Sunday
this
year?
No
work?
What
can
we
do?
I
don't
know.
Well,
what
would
you
like
to
do?
-
Got
any
ideas?
Hmm?
Let
me
think.
Let
me
think.
Hey,
we
never
finished
seeing
all
the
sights
Didn't
get
to
Lee
Mansion
Shall
we
do
that?
Go
sightseeing?
-
Yeah,
let's
do
that.
And
tomorrow
night,
Oh,
I
love
you.
I
love
you,
Rags.

We'll
have
a
good
day,
yeah?
You
can
bring
Mr.
Dennings,
if
you
like.
Mr.
Dennings?
Well,
you
know,
it's
okay.
Well,
thank
you
very
much...
...but
why
on
earth
would
I
wanna
bring
Well,
you
like
him.
Yeah,
I
like
him.
Don't
you
like
him?
-
You're
gonna
marry
him,
aren't
you?
-
What?
Don't
be
silly.
Of
course
not.
Where
did
you
ever
get
an
idea
like
that?
But
you
like
him.
Of
course
I
like
him.
I
like
pizzas
too,
You
don't
like
him
like
Daddy?
Regan,
I
love
your
daddy.
I'll
always
love
your
daddy,
honey.
Okay?
Burke
just
comes

...well,
he's
lonely.
Well,
I
heard
differently.
Oh,
you
did?
What
did
you
hear,
huh?
-
I
don't
know.
I
just
thought.
Well,
you
didn't
think
so
good.
-
How
do
you
know?
Ha,
ha.
Because
Burke
and
I
are
just
friends.
Okay.
You
ready
for
sleep?
-
Good
night.

Lord,
I
was
born
a
ramblin'
man

KARRAS:
She's
alone.
I
never
should
have
left
her.
At
least
in
New
York,
I'd
be
near
her.
I
could
see
about
a
transfer,
Damien.
I
need
reassignment,
Tom.
I
want

You're
the
best
we've
got.
Am
I
really?
It's
more
than
psychiatry,
Some
of
their
problems
come
down
...their
vocation,
the
meaning
of
their
lives,
I
need
out.
I'm
unfit.
Think
I've
lost
my
faith,
Tom.
Hello?
Yes,
this
is
Mrs.
MacNeil.
Operator,
you
have
got
to
be
kidding!
I
have
been
on
this
line
for
20
minutes!
Jesus
Christ.
Can
you
believe
this?
He
doesn't
even
call
his
daughter
-
Maybe
the
circuit
is
busy.
He
doesn't
give
a
shit.
-
Why
don't
you
let
me...?
Yes.
No,
operator,
It's
the
Hotel
Excelsior
in
Rome.
Would
you
try
it
again,
please,
Hello?
Yes.
No,
operator,
Do
you
take
an
illiteracy
test
to
get
Don't
tell
me
to
be
calm,
goddamn
it!

Yeah?
You're
kidding
me.
Okay.
I
thought
I
just
went
to
bed.
Yeah.
Hey,
what
are
we
doing,
scene
61?
Okay.
Oh,
just
remind
Flo
about
All
right.
Yeah,
I'll
see
you.
What
are
you
doing
here?
My
bed
was
shaking.
I
can't
get
to
sleep.
Oh,
honey.




Goddamn
it.
Jesus.


KARL:
Oh,
Karl.
Jesus
Christ,
Karl,
don't
do
that.
Very
sorry,
but
you
see,
no
rats.
No
rats.
Thanks
a
lot.
That's
terrific.

Oh,
my
God.

NURSE:
Arm
up.
Very
good.
That
wasn't
so
bad,
was
it?
Remain
perfectly
still.
Breathe
normally.
DOCTOR:
Regan?
You
feel
anything?
Can
you
feel
this?
I
don't
feel
anything.
Put
this
in
your
mouth.
Keep
it
there.
When
the
red
light
goes
on,
I
don't
want
it.

A
disorder
of
the
nerves.
At
least
we
think
it
is.
We
don't
know
yet
exactly
how
it
works.
It's
often
seen
in
early
adolescence.
She
shows
all
the
symptoms.
Hyperactivity.
Her
temper.
Performance
in
math.
CHRIS:
It
affects
her
concentration.
CHRIS:
-
Now,
this
is
for
Ritalin.
Ten
milligrams
a
day.
Is
that
a
tranquilizer?
It's
a
stimulant.
A
stimulant?
My
God,
Her
condition
isn't
quite
what
it
seems.
Nobody
knows
the
cause
of
hyperkinetic
The
Ritalin
seems
to
work
And
as
to
how
or
why,
But,
uh,
her
symptoms
could
be
That's
out
of
my
field.
My
daughter
isn't
depressed.
Well,
you
mentioned
her
father
You
think
I
should
take
her
No.
I
think
we
should
wait
I
think
that's
the
answer.
-
Okay.
All
right.
And
the
lies
she's
been
telling?
-
Lies?
Have
you
ever
known
your
daughter
-
To
use
obscenities?
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar...
Similar
to
things
like
her
lying...
-
...it's
uncharacteristic
for
her.
Well,
she
let
loose
quite
a
string
I
find
that
hard
to
believe.
Her
vocabulary
is
rather
extensive.
Well,
give
me
an
example.
Like
what?
Specifically,
what
did
she
say?
Specifically,
Mrs.
MacNeil...
...she
advised
me
to
keep
my
fingers
...goddamn
cunt.
I
can't
believe
it.

-
She...
No.
I
think
the
best
explanation
-
Well,
we'll
wait.
We'll
wait
and
see.
So
in
the
meantime...
...try
not
to
worry.
How?
The
edema
affected
her
brain,
She
don't
let
no
doctor
come
near
her.
She
was
all
the
time
screaming,
-
You
should've
called
me
when
it
happened.
Regular
hospital
not
gonna
We
give
her
a
shot
and
bring
her
here...
...until
the
doctors
fix
up
her
leg,
Two
or
three
months
and
she's
out,
-
Miss?
We
want
to
see
Mrs.
Karras.
-
Do
you
have
an
appointment?
-
Are
you
a
relative?
Just
a
minute.

You
know,
it's
funny.
If
you
wasn't
a
priest,
you'd
be
famous
Your
mother,
she'd
be
living
in
a
penthouse
You
go
in,
Dimmy.
You'll
find
Mrs.
Karras
in
the
last
bed
No,
no.
No,
no.
Go
get
someone
else.
Go
to
your
bed.
Go
to
your
bed.

No,
no.
No,
no.
The
father
will
be
back
to
see
you.
Mama.
It's
Dimmy,
Mama.
Dimmy.
Why
you
did
this
to
me,
Dimmy?
Why?
Come
on,
I'm
gonna
take
you
home.

Mama,
everything's
gonna
be
all
right.
Mama,
I'm
gonna
take
you
home.
-
Couldn't
you
have
put
her
someplace
else?
Who
got
the
money
for
that,
Dimmy?


There
seems
to
be
an
alien

hair

I
beg
your
pardon?
We're
pretty
comfortable
up
there

for?

And
you
never
went
bowling
with
Goebbels,
Nazi
bastard.
Over
behind
the
church.
-
It's
a
red
brick
wing.
What
goes
on
there?
He's
there
all
the
time.
He
has
black
hair.
-
Damien
Karras.
That's
his
office,
back
of
Saint
Mike's.
He
had
a
pretty
rough
knock
last
night,
She
was
living
by
herself...
...and
I
guess
she
was
dead

Hun.
Bloody,
damned,
butchering

pig.

KARL:

What's
the
matter
with
you?
What's
for
dessert?
You
sleeping?
You
get
some
sleep.

CHRIS:
Listen,
Burke,
your
car's
at
the
curb.
Yes,
honey.
What?
Fuck
it.


-
I've
never
seen
him
acting
up.

ALL
:
-
Hi,
Chris.
This
is
a
great
party.
I
don't
need
any
encouragement.
My
idea
...with
me
as
a
headliner
for
all
eternity,

ALL
:
Of
Thoity-Thoid
and

That's
my

sweet

Some
people
think
Just
because...
Hey,
I
think
we've
got
a
guest.
You're
gonna
die
up
there.
Regan?
Oh,
my
God,
honey.
Honey,
what's
the
matter?
-
Sorry,
she's
sick.
She
didn't
know
what
she
was
saying.
What
made
you
say
that,
Regan?
Do
you
know,
sweetheart?
REGAN:
What's
wrong
with
me?
It's
just
like
the
doctor
said.
You
just
take
your
pills
Okay?
Is
it
coming
out,
Willi?
-
Yes,
I
think
so.


REGAN:
Mother!
Mother!

Mother!
Mother!

Oh,

gonna

I'll
talk
to
you
about

KARRAS:
MAN
4:
Hey,
if
you
get
a
chance,
KARRAS:
Where'd
you
get
the
money
-
...the
poor
box?
That's
an
insult.
I
got
a
vow
of
poverty.
Where'd
you
get
it,
then?
I
stole
it.
I
believe
you.
College
presidents
shouldn't
drink.
I
figure
I
saved
him
from
Oh,
Christ!
I
should
have
been
there.
I
wasn't
there.
There
was
nothing
you
could
do.
Lie
down.
Give
me
the
butt.
Come
on.
-
Now
you
think
you
can
sleep?
-
Are
you
gonna
steal
my
shoes
now?
I
tell
fortunes
by
reading
the
creases.
Good
night.
KARRAS:



I
don't
want
it!
-
Regan,
honey,
it's
to
help
you.
-
Hold
still,
honey.
You
fucking
bastard!
Remember
also,
O
Lord,
...who
has
gone
before
us
with
the
sign
of
ALL:
But
only
say
the
word
May
the
body
of
Christ
bring
me
Well,
it's
a
symptom...
...of
a
type
of
disturbance
in
In
your
daughter's
case,
the
temporal
lobe,
-
Mm-hm.
...but
it
does
cause
bizarre
...and
usually
just
before
a
convulsion.
A
convulsion?
The
shaking
of
the
bed.
Oh,
no,
no,
that
was
no
spasm.
Look,
I
got
on
the
bed.
The
whole
bed
was
thumping
...and
shaking,
the
whole
thing,
Mrs.
MacNeil,
the
problem
It's
her
brain.
So,
um,
ahem.
What
causes
this?
Lesion.
Lesion
in
the
temporal
lobe.
It's
a
kind
of
seizure
disorder.
Look,
Doc,
I
really
don't
understand
how
-
In
the
temporal
lobe,
it's
very
common.
It,
uh,
can
last
for
days,
even
weeks.
It
isn't
rare
to
find
destructive...
...even
criminal
behavior.
Hey,
do
me
a
favor,
will
you?
Don't
be
alarmed.
If
it's
a
lesion,
All
we
have
to
do
is
remove
the
scar.
-
Let's
move
her.
A
little
more.
Good.
Regan,
I'm
just
gonna
move
you
down
NURSE:
It's
okay.
See?
There
we
go.
MAN:
NURSE:
MAN:
Good.
Now,
Regan,
you're
gonna
feel
Okay.
Now
you're
gonna
feel

Good.
Okay.
You're
gonna
feel


MAN:


DOCTOR:
No
vascular
displacement
at
all.
Do
you
want
me
to
run
another
series?
I
don't
think
so.
I'd
like
you
to
see
her
again.
Excuse
me,
doctor.
She
says
it's
urgent.
-
You
got
some
time?


-
Dr.
Klein?
-
This
is
Dr.
Taney.
Things
have
gotten
worse
since
I
phoned.
-
Is
she
having
spasms
again?
-
Did
you
give
her
the
medication?
-
What
was
that?
Before
that,
it
was
Ritalin.

Chris,
doctors.

This
is

CHRIS:
What
is
it?
It's
burning!
It's
burning!
CHRIS:
Please,
Mother,
make
it
stop!
Mother!
Mother!


All
right,
Regan,
CHRIS:

Fuck
me!
Fuck
me!
Fuck
me!


REGAN:
TANEY:
REGAN:


She's
heavily
sedated.
She'll
probably
sleep
through
tomorrow.
What
was
going
on
in
there?
Pathological
states
can
induce
...accelerated
motor
performance.
For
example...
...say
a
90-pound
woman
sees
her
child
...runs
out
and
lifts
the
wheels
You've
heard
the
story.
Same
thing
here.
Same
principle,
I
mean.
So,
what's
wrong
with
her?
We
still
think
that
the
temporal
lobe...
Oh,
what
are
you
talking
about,
Did
you
see
her
or
not?
She's
acting
like
she's
fucking
Psychotic,
like
a
split
personality,
or...
Oh,
Jesus,
I'm
sorry.
There
haven't
been
more
than
...of
so-called
"split
personality,"
Now,
I
know
the
temptation
is
...but
any
reasonable
psychiatrist
would
So,
what's
next?
A
pneumoencephalogram,
It
will
involve
another
spinal.
Oh,
Christ!
Well,
what
we
missed
in
the
EEG
...could
conceivably
turn
up
there.
At
least
it
would
eliminate
certain

KLEIN:
In
other
words,
normal.
You
keep
any
drugs
in
your
house?
No,
of
course
not.
Nothing
like
that.
Are
you
sure?
Well,
of
course,
I'm
sure.
I'd
tell
you.
Christ,
I
don't
even
smoke
grass.
Are
you
planning
to
be
home
soon?
I
mean,
uh,
to
L.A.,
I
mean.
Um...
No,
I,
uh...
I'm
building
a
new
house.
My
old
one
has
been
sold.
I
don't
know.
I
was
gonna
take...
I
was
gonna
take
Regan
to
Europe
Why
do
you
ask?
I
think
it's
time
we
started
looking


Hello?
Sharon?
Shit.
God.
Sharon!
What
do
you
mean,

Her
window's
wide
open.
-
Didn't
he
tell
you?
-
Burke
is...
Nobody
was
here.
-
...I
had
him
stay
with
her,
and...
-
I
should
have
known
better.
Sorry.
How
were
the
tests?
We
have
to
start
looking
for
a
shrink.
Hi,
Chuck.
Come
on
in.
I
suppose
you
heard.
Heard
what?
You
haven't
heard.
Burke's
dead.
He
must
have
been
drunk.
He
fell
from
By
the
time
he
hit
M
Street,
CHRIS:

No!
Yeah,
I
know.

Sharon...
Oh,
my
God.

Oh,
my
God.
PSYCHIATRIST:
When
I
touch
Are
you
comfortable,
Regan?
Yes.
How
old
are
you?
Twelve.
Is
there
someone
inside
you?
Sometimes.
Who
is
it?
I
don't
know.
Is
it
Captain
Howdy?
I
don't
know.
If
I
ask
him
to
tell
me,
No.
PSYCHIATRIST:
I'm
afraid.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Do
you
want
him
to
leave
you?
Yes.
I'm
speaking
to
the
person
If
you
are
there,
you,
too,
are
hypnotized
Come
forward...
...and
answer
me
now.



Are
you
the
person
inside
of
Regan?
Who
are
you?


-
Help
me!

Father
Karras?
Have
we
met?
No,
we
haven't
met,
That
you
look
like
a
boxer.
William
F.
Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's
this
all
about?
It's
true.
You
do
look
like
a
boxer.
Like
John
Garfield
in
Body
and
Soul.
Exactly.
John
Garfield.
Do
people
tell
you
Always.
Well,
you
know
this
director
...Burke
Dennings?
I've
seen
him.
You've
seen
him.
You're
also
familiar
how
last
week
Only
what
I
read
in
the
papers.
Father,
what
do
you
know
on
From
the
witching
end,
not
the
hunting.
I
once
did
a
paper
on
it.
Really?
From
the
psychiatric
end.
I
know.
I
read
it.
All
of
this
desecration
in
the
church...
...do
you
think
this
has
anything
to
do
Maybe.
Some
rituals
used
in
And
now
Dennings.
In
a
fall.
Let
me
tell
you
how.
...confidential.
Burke
Dennings,
good
Father...
...was
found
at
the
bottom
of
those
steps
...with
his
head
turned
completely
...facing
backwards.
Didn't
happen
in
the
fall?
It's
possible.
-
Possible,
however...
Exactly.
So
on
the
one
hand,
...and
on
the
other
hand,
a
black
mass-type
You
think
the
killer
Maybe
somebody
crazy...
...somebody
with
a
spite
against
Some
unconscious
rebellion.
KARRAS:
Look,
Father,
this
is
hard
for
you.
...but
for
priests
on
the
campus
here,
You'd
know
who
was
sick
at
the
time,
I
mean,
this
kind
of
sickness,
I
don't
know
anyone
who
fits
Ah.
Doctor's
ethics.
No,
I
probably
wouldn't.
Not
to
bother
you
with
trivia,
...in
sunny
California,
no
less...
...was
put
in
jail
for
not
telling
the
police
-
Is
that
a
threat?
Incidentally,
...I
could
always
tell
the
judge
it
was

Hey,
Father,
wait
a
minute.
-
Do
you
like
movies?
Well,
I
get
passes
Mrs.
K,
though,
you
know,
-
That's
too
bad.
I
love
to
talk
film...
...discuss,
to
critique.
You
want
to
see
a
film
with
me?
-
Who's
in
it?
Debbie
Reynolds,
Desdemona,
-
I've
seen
it.
One
last
time.
You
can
think
-
Come
on.
All
right.
All
right.
-
You
know
who
I
think
really
did
it?
The
Dominicans.
Go
pick
on
them.
I
could
have
you
deported,
I
lied.
You
look
like
Sal
Mineo.
BARRINGER:
It
looks
like
a
type
of
disorder
...except
in
primitive
cultures.
We
call
it,
uh,
Quite
frankly,
we
really
don't
know
...except
that
it
starts
with
a
conflict
...and
it
leads
to
the
patient's
delusions
...by
some
alien
intelligence.
Um...
A
spirit,
if
you
will.
Look,
I'm
telling
you
again,
...I
am
not
going
to
lock
her
up
-
Well,
it's
out
of...
I'm
not
putting
her
away.
Well,
I'm
sorry.
You're
sorry?
Jesus
Christ!
Eighty-eight
doctors,
and
all
you
can
Of
course,
there
is
one
outside
chance
But,
um,
I
think
of
it
As
I
said,
it's
a
very
outside
chance...
Would
you
just
name
it,
for
God's
sakes?
-
Do
you
have
any
religious
beliefs?
What
about
your
daughter?
No.
Why?
Have
you
ever
heard
of
exorcism?
Well,
it's
a
stylized
ritual...
...in
which
the,
uh,
rabbi
or
the
priest
try
It's
been
pretty
much
discarded
...except
by
the
Catholics,
who
keep
it
But
it,
uh,
has
worked,
in
fact...
...although
not
for
the
reasons
they
think,
It's
purely
force
of
suggestion.
The,
uh...
The
victim's
belief
in
possession
...so
in
that
same
way...
...the
belief
in
the
power
of
exorcism
You're
telling
me
that
I
should
Is
that
it?
Karl?
Did
you
put
this
in
Regan's
bedroom?
She's
going
to
be
well?
Karl,
if
you
put
this
in
Regan's
bedroom,
No,
not
me.
I
didn't.
This
was
under
Regan's
pillow.
Of
course,
I
didn't.
I
didn't
put
it.

KARL:
Excuse
me,
madam.
-
A
man
to
see
you.
KINDERMAN:
...if
Mr.
Dennings
was
in
her
room
-
Why
do
you
ask?
Might
she
remember?
No,
she
was
heavily
sedated.
It's
serious?
Yes,
I'm
afraid
it
is.
-
May
I
ask...?
Watch
out
for
drafts.
A
draft
in
the
fall
when
the
house
is
hot
Excuse
me,
madam.
Anything
else?
No,
Karl,
we're
fine.
Thank
you.
It's
all
right,
Karl.
Why
are
you
asking
all
this?
It's
strange.
The
deceased
comes
to
visit,
...and
leaves
all
alone
a
very
sick
girl.
And
speaking
plainly,
Mrs.
MacNeil...
...it
isn't
likely
he
would
fall
Besides,
a
fall
wouldn't
do
to
his
neck
Except
maybe
one
chance
in
a
thousand.
No.
My
hunch...
My
opinion...
...he
was
killed
by
a
very
powerful
man:
And
the
fracturing
of
his
skull:
point
two...
...plus
the
various
other
things
...would
make
it
very
probable...
...probable,
not
certain...
...that
the
deceased
was
killed
and
But
nobody
was
in
the
room
It
could
be
one
way.
If
someone
came
calling
...and
the
time
you
returned.
Judas
Priest,
just
a
second.
-
The
servants?
They
have
visitors?
You
were
expecting
a
package
that
day,
Not
that
I
know
of.
Groceries,
cleaning,
uh,
a
package?
I
really
wouldn't
know.
I
see.
Would
you
like
to
ask
him?
No,
never
mind,
it's...
It's
very
remote.
No,
never
mind.
Yeah.
Would
you
like
some
more
coffee?
Please.

That's
cute.
Your
daughter,
she's
the
artist?
-
Thank
you.
Incidentally,
um...
...you
might
ask
your
daughter...
...if
she
remembers
seeing
Mr.
Dennings
Look,
he
wouldn't
have
any
reason
Oh,
I
know,
I
realize...
...but
if
certain
British
doctors
never
asked,
...we
wouldn't
today
have
penicillin.
Well,
when
she's
better,
I'll
ask
her.
-
Yeah,
couldn't
hurt.
Uh,
in
the
meantime...
That's
okay.
-
I
really
hate
to
ask
you
this,
but...
For
my
daughter,
Of
course.
Uh,
where's
a
pencil?
Right
here.
Here.
Oh.
She'd
love
it.
And
what's
her
name?
I
lied.
It's
for
me.

-
The
spelling
is
on
the
back:
Kinderman.
You
know
that
film
you
made,
um,
Angel?
-
Oh,
yeah.
-
Really?
Ha,
ha.
Thank
you.
You're
a
very
nice
lady.
-
Thank
you.
Uh,
I'll
come
back
-
Bye.

SHARON:
Mrs.
MacNeil,
open
the
door!

Open
the
door!

...your
cunting
daughter?

Chris
MacNeil?
Please,
go
away.
I'm
Father
Karras.
I'm
very
sorry.
Hello.
I
should
have
told
you
Yeah,
that
would
have
helped.
-
Have
you
got
a
cigarette,
Father?
Thanks.
Cold.
Yeah.
Uh...
How
did
a
shrink
ever
get
to
be
a
priest?
It's
the
other
way
around.
The
Society
Oh.
Where?
Harvard,
Bellevue,
Johns
Hopkins.
-
Places
like
that.
-
You're
a
friend
of
Father
Dyer's,
right?
-
Pretty
close?
Did
he
talk
to
you
about
my
party?
He
sure
did.
About
my
daughter?
No,
I
didn't
know
you
had
one.
-
He
didn't
mention
her?
Oh.
Didn't
tell
you
what
she
did?
He
didn't
mention
her.
Priests
are
pretty
tight-mouthed,
That
depends.
-
On
what?
Sure.
I
mean,
what
if
a
person,
...you
know,
that
was
a
murderer
...and
they
wanted
some
kind
of
help?
I
mean,
would
you
have
to
turn
him
in?
Well,
if
he
came
to
me
for
spiritual
advice,
-
You
wouldn't?
But
I
would
try
to
convince
him
Mm-hm.
And,
uh,
how
do
you
go
about
I
beg
your
pardon?
If,
um...
If
a
person's,
you
know,
...how
do
they
get
an
exorcism?
I'd
have
to
get
them
into
a
time
machine
I
didn't
get
you.
It
just
doesn't
happen
anymore,
Oh,
yeah?
Since
when?
Well,
since
we
learned
about
mental
illness,
All
those
things
they
taught
me
Mrs.
MacNeil,
...I've
never
met
one
priest
Yeah,
well...

...it
just
so
happens
that
somebody
...is
probably
possessed.
And
needs
an
exorcist.
Father
Karras,
it's
my
little
girl.

Then
that's
all
the
more
reason
Why?
I
don't
understand.
-
To
begin
with,
it
could
make
things
worse.
Secondly,
the
Church,
...conducts
an
investigation
to
see
if
-
Yeah,
but...
-
You
could
do
it
yourself.
-
...and
that's
rarely
given.
-
Could
you
see
her?
I
could
see
her
as
a
psychiatrist,
but
I...
Oh,
not
a
psychiatrist.
She
needs
a
priest.
She's
seen
every
fucking
psychiatrist
Now
are
you
gonna
send
me
-
Jesus
Christ,
won't
somebody
help
me?
Oh,
God,
can't
you
help
her?


It
wants
no
straps.
KARRAS:
I'm
a
friend
of
your
mother's.

I'm
afraid
you
might
hurt
yourself,
I'm
not
Regan.
I
see.
Well,
then,
let's
introduce
ourselves.
And
I'm
the
devil.
Now,
kindly
undo
these
straps.
If
you're
the
devil,
That's
much
too
vulgar
a
display
Where's
Regan?
In
here,
with
us.
Show
me
Regan


Would
you
like
to
leave
a
message?
I'll
see
that
she
gets
it.
If
that's
true...
...then
you
must
know
my
mother's
What
is
it?
What
is
it?



Thank
you.
Look,
I'm
only
against
the
possibility
of
Nothing
you
could
do
I
can't
do
it.
I
need
evidence
that
the
Church
-
...as
signs
of
possession.
Speaking
in
a
language
What
else?
I
don't
know.
I'd
have
to
look
it
up.
I
thought
you
were
supposed
There
are
no
experts.
You
probably
know
as
much
about
Look,
your
daughter
doesn't
say
She
says
she's
the
devil
himself.
If
you've
seen
as
many
psychotics
...you'd
realize
that's
the
same
thing
You
asked
me
what
I
think
is
best
Six
months
under
observation
You
show
me
Regan's
double...
...same
face,
same
voice,
everything...
...and
I'd
know
it
wasn't
Regan.
I'd
know
in
my
gut.
I'm
telling
you
that
that
thing
upstairs
I
want
you
to
tell
me
that
you
know
...that
there's
nothing
wrong
Tell
me
you
know
for
a
fact
You
tell
me
that!
Did
Regan
know
a
priest
was
-
No.
-
Yes,
I
did.
I'm
very
sorry.
Is
Regan
aware
of
it?
Not
at
all.
Why
do
you
ask?
It's
not
important.
Good
night.

[CHRIS
SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY
CHRIS:
Here,
take
it
and
just
don't...
Hello,
Daddy?
This
is
me.
-
What
should
I
say?
I
don't
know.
-
Anything
you
want.
CHRIS:
Tell
him
what
you've
been
doing
REGAN:
Well,
you
see,
um...
I
mean,
I
hope
you
can
hear
me.
-
Well,
uh,
let
me
see.
REGAN:
CHRIS:
Go
on.
Talk
to
your
daddy,
honey.
I
don't
know
what
to
say,
though.
Um...
Well,
let's
see.
First
we...
No.
-
Wait.
I
don't
know.
-
Tell
him
about
Washington.
See,
we're
in
Washington
now,
He
broke
the
bread,
"Take
this,
all
of
you,
and
eat
it...
...for
this
is
my
body."
When
the
supper
was
ended,
Again
he
gave
you
thanks
and
praise.
He
gave
the
cup
to
his
disciples
and
said,
...all
of
you,
and
drink
from
it.
This
is
the
cup
of
my
blood.
The
blood
of
the
new
and
everlasting

You'd
like
that?
Intensely.
But
wouldn't
that
drive
you
It
would
bring
us
together.
You
and
Regan?
You
and
us.

-
Did
you
do
that?
-
Do
it
again.
No,
now.
In
time.
Mirabile
dictu,
don't
you
agree?
You
speak
Latin?




How
long
are
you
planning
Until
she
rots
and
lies
stinking
What's
that?
Holy
water.
You
keep
it
away.

It
burns!
Oh,
it
burns!




Who
are
you?

CHRIS:
No,
I'm
just
exhausted
from
work.
Um...
She's...
She's
all
right.
She's
just
a
little...
I
don't
want
to
talk
about
it,
okay?
Um...
Okay,
I'll
talk
to
you.
No,
I
just...
I'm
really...
...and
I
just
have
to,
uh...
No,
no.
No,
no.
There's
nothing.
Hey,
thanks
a
lot.
Bye,
now.
-
Want
a
drink?
What
do
you
drink?
Uh,
Scotch.
-
Ice,
water.
No
ice.
I'll
get
some
from
the

No,
I'll
take
it
straight.
No,
please,
sit.
-
Really?
You
sure?
Where's
her
father?
In
Europe.
-
Have
you
told
him
what's
happening?
Well,
I
think
you
should.
I
told
Regan
that
was
holy
water.
I
sprinkled
It's
tap
water.
What's
the
difference?
Holy
water's
blessed.
And
that
doesn't
She
killed
Burke
Dennings.
What?
She
killed
Burke
Dennings.
She
pushed
him
out
her
window.

It's
a
language,
all
right.
It's
English.
What
do
you
mean?
It's
English
in

Listen.
DEMONIC
VOICE:
Let
her
die.
DEMONIC
VOICE
:
Fear
the
priest.

Fear
the
priest.
Merrin!

I
am
no
one.
Merrin!
Fear
the
priest.

Merrin!
Merrin!
Yeah?
Yeah?
I'll
be
right
there.
I
don't
want
Chris
to
see
this.
-
Well,
what's
wrong?
What
is
it?
You're
convinced
that
it's
genuine?
I
don't
know.
No,
not
really,
I
suppose.
But
I
have
made...
...a
prudent
judgment
that
it
meets
You
would
want
to
do
the
exorcism
Yes.
Might
be
best
to
have
a
man
Maybe
someone
who's
spent
time
I
understand,
Your
Excellency.
Let's
see
who's
around.
In
the
meantime,
Thank
you,
Your
Excellency.
Well,
he
does
know
the
background.
I
doubt
there's
any
danger
in
just
There
should
be
a
psychiatrist
present,
What
about
the
exorcist?
Have
you
any
ideas?
How
about
Lankester
Merrin?
Merrin?
I
had
a
notion
he
was
in
Iraq.
I
read
he
was
working
on
a
dig
You're
right,
but
he's
finished.
He
came
back
three
or
four
months
ago.
What's
he
doing
there,
teaching?
He's
working
on
another
book.
Don't
you
think
he's
too
old,
Tom?
He
must
be
all
right.
Mm.
-
Besides,
he's
had
experience.
Ten,
12
years
ago,
I
think,
in
Africa.
The
exorcism
supposedly
lasted
months.
Father?
-
You're
Mrs.
MacNeil?
I'm
Father
Merrin.
-
Come
in.
-
Is
Father
Karras
here?
-
He's
here
already.
-
Father
Karras.

-
Are
you
very
tired?
I'd
like
you
to
go
quickly
across
...and
gather
up
a
cassock
for
myself...
...two
surplices,
a
purple
stole,
...and,
um...
...your
copy
of
The
Roman
Ritual.
I
believe
we
should
begin.
Do
you
want
to
hear
the
background
Why?
MAN
:
You
can
choose
to
escape,
if
you
want,
Don't
let
anyone
decide
for
you.

Hail
Mary,
full
of
grace...

-
Excuse
me.
Thank
you
very
much.
You're
welcome.
Would
you
like
some
brandy
in
that,
Well,
the
doctors
say
I
shouldn't.
But
thank
God...
...my
will
is
weak.
MERRIN:
Especially
important
is
the
warning
We
may
ask
what
is
relevant,
He's
a
liar.
The
demon
is
a
liar.
He
will
lie
to
confuse
us.
But
he
will
also
mix
lies
with
the
truth...
...to
attack
us.
The
attack
is
psychological,
Damien.
And
powerful.
So
don't
listen.
Remember
that.
Do
not
listen.
It
might
be
helpful
...on
the
different
personalities
Regan
So
far,
I'd
say
there
seem
to
be
three.
-
She's
convinced
that
she's...

What
is
your
daughter's
middle
name,
Teresa.
What
a
lovely
name.

...you
motherfucking
-
Be
silent!

Our
Father,
who
art
in
heaven...
...hallowed
be
thy
name.
Thy
kingdom
come.
Thy
will
be
done...
...on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven.
Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread.
Forgive
us
our
trespasses...
...as
we
forgive
those
who
trespass
And
lead
us
not
into
temptation.
But
deliver
us
from
the
evil
one.
Save
me,
O
God,
by
thy
name.

Proud
men
have
risen
up
against
me,
...but
God
is
my
helper
In
every
need,
he
has
delivered
me.
Glory
be
to
the
Father,
As
it
was
in
the
beginning,
-
Save
your
servant.
-
Be
unto
her,
O
Lord,
a
fortified
tower.

-
Let
the
enemy
have
no
power
over
her.
Your
mother
sucks
cocks
in
hell,
Karras.
The
Lord
be
with
you.
-
And
also
with
you.
Holy
Lord,
almighty
Father...

...everlasting
God...
...and
Father
of
our
Lord,
Jesus
Christ...
...who,
once
and
for
all,
consigned
...who
sent
your
only
begotten
son
...hasten
to
our
call
for
help...
...and
snatch
from
ruination
and
...this
human
being,
Strike
terror,
Lord,
into
the
beast
Let
your
mighty
hand
cast
him
out

...so
he
may
no
longer
hold
captive
...whom
it
pleased
you
to
make
Aah!
MERRIN:...and
to
redeem
through
your
son,
...in
the
unity
of
the
Holy
Spirit,
-
Amen.

MERRIN:
Father
Karras.
Damien.
The
response,
please,
Damien!
And
let
my
cry
come
unto
thee.
Almighty
Lord,
word
of
God
the
Father,
...God
and
Lord
of
all
creation...

MERRIN:
...the
power
to
tramp
underfoot
Grant
me...
...your
unworthy
servant...
-
...pardon
for
all
my
sins...
...and
the
power
to
confront

See
the
cross
of
the
Lord.
-
O
Lord,
hear
my
prayer.
-
The
Lord
be
with
you.

Father.

I
cast
you
out,
unclean
spirit!
-
Shove
it
up
your
ass,
you
faggot!

It
is
he
who
commands
you!
He
who
flung
you
straight
from
heaven
-
Fuck
him!
REGAN:
Fuck
him,
Karras!

Be
gone!
In
the
name
of
the
Father,
...and
the
Holy
Spirit.
By
this
sign
of
the
Holy
Cross,
...who
lives
and
reigns
with
the
Father
Damien!
Amen.
MERRIN:

...look
down
in
pity...
You
killed
your
mother!
-
Shut
up!
KARRAS:
Shut
up!

MERRIN:
...by
the
judge
of
the
living
...to
depart
from
this
servant
of
God.
It's
the
power...
Holy
water.

MERRIN:
-
The
power
of
Christ
compels
you!
-
The
power
of
Christ
compels
you!
-
The
power
of
Christ
compels
you!

of

-
The
power
of
Christ
compels
you.
He
brought
you
low
Do
not
despise
my
command,
It
is
God
himself
who
commands
you.
The
majestic
Christ
who
commands
you.
God,
the
Father,
commands
you.

God,
the
Son,
commands
you.

God,
the
Holy
Spirit,
commands
you.
The
mystery
of
the
cross
commands
you.
The
blood
of
the
martyrs
commands
you.

MERRIN:
You're
guilty
before
almighty
God.
Guilty
before
his
son.
Guilty
before
the
whole
human
race.
It
is
the
Lord
who
expels
you...
...he
who
is
coming
to
judge
both
the
living
Are
you
tired?
Let's
rest
before
we
start
again.
Why
this
girl?
It
doesn't
make
sense.
I
think
the
point
is
to
make
us
despair.
To
see
ourselves
as...
...animal
and
ugly.
To
reject
the
possibility
that
God
Will
you
excuse
me,
Damien?
WOMAN:
No.
No.


Please,
Dimmy.
I'm
afraid.
You're
not
my
mother.
Dimmy,
please!
MERRIN:
Her
heart.
Can
you
give
her
something?
KARRAS:

You're
not
my
mother!
MERRIN:
Why,
Dimmy?
Damien.
-
Dimmy,
please.
Get
out.

Our
Father
who
art
in
heaven,
Is
it
over?
Mm-mm.
Is
she
gonna
die?
No.



You
son
of
a
bitch!

Take
me.
Come
into
me.
Goddamn
you,
take
me!
Take
me!


No!

Mother.

Do
you
want
to
make
your
confession?
Are
you
sorry
for...?
Are
you
sorry
for
having
offended
God

-
Where
do
you
want
this?
Phonograph.
Storage.
That's
everything.
I'm
gonna
miss
you.
Same
here.
Sure
you
won't
change
your
mind?
I
found
this
in
her
room.
You
better
hurry.
Come
on,
honey,
we
have
to
get
going.
She
doesn't
remember
any
of
it.
That's
good.
-
All
done.
Honey,
this
is
Father
Dyer.
-
Hi,
Father.
Ready,
missus.

Goodbye,
Father.
I'll
call
you.
Bye.

Bye,
Father.
I
hope
so
too.
CHRIS:
I
thought
you'd
like
to
keep
this.
DYER:
Lieutenant.
You
just
missed
them.
How's
the
girl?
She
seemed
fine.
That's
important.
That's
important.
Well,
well...
...back
to
business,
back
to
work.
-
Goodbye,
Father.
Father
Dyer...
...do
you
go
to
films?
Sure.
Well,
I
got
passes.
In
fact,
I
got
a
pass
to
the
Crest
Would
you
like
to
go?
-
What's
playing?
Who's
in
it?
Heathcliff,
Jackie
Gleason,
and
in
the
role
I've
seen
it.
Another
one.

Had
your
lunch?
