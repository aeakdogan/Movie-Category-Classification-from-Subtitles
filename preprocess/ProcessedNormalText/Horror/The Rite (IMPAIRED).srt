It

It's

I

somewhat
responsible.

average
age
Sixty-nine.

thousand

You

No,
just

I
believe
in.
I
quit
smoking

You
know,
what
I
saw
the
other
night,
I
know
experienced
priests
I
just
repeated
a
few
prayers
And
the
words
meant
nothing

listen

What
is
this
about?
Last
year,
the
Vatican
received
over
a

That's
something
of
a
record.
An
order
has
been
passed
down...
...to
place
an
exorcist
in
every
diocese
As
you
might
imagine,
it's
not
There's
a
new
program
at

to
keep

a
minute,

You
want
me
to
be

exorcist?
Why?
Why
would
you

I
don't
know
what
I

That's

I
remember

there's

MAN:
By
the
time
an
exorcist
is
called

the

would
have

that

demonic
spirit's
grasp.
This
was
taken
at
an
exorcism
in
Turin.

The
woman
survived
without
food
or
water

the
demon
released
her.

soldiers...
...often
operating
in
groups

their
victims.
It
is
the
job
of
an
exorcist...
...to
determine
the
number
of
...something
the
demons
protect
And
when
the
exorcist
has
a
name...
...he
can
then
begin
to

does

How
could

a
village

that
he
was
abducted
by
aliens?
It's
just
as
unlikely.
But
we're
willing
to
call
him
crazy
...because
he
believes
in
aliens,

We're
not

The
object
of
this
course
is
to

So
which
do

believe
in,
The
jury's
out
on
both.
Interesting
perspective
for
a
priest.
I'm
not

So
you're
having
a
final
fling
Well,
I
guess
it's

both
of
us.
What
do

think
of
the
course
so
far?
To
be
honest,
I
don't
know

Tell
me,
Michael,
do
you
believe
in
sin?
Yeah,
I
just
don't
necessarily
believe

committeth
sin
is
of

devil.
Then
that'd
be
all
of

Beelzebub,

Well,
how
will
her
baby
survive
this?
See,
it's
very
difficult
to
predict
how
-
Have
you
ever
lost
a
patient?
Yeah,
a
boy
I
once
treated.
...and
he
committed
suicide...
...and
I
was
depressed
...and
I
started
to
doubt
everything
And
I
thought
the
devil
had
defeated
me.
Don't
you
think
she
should
You're
still
not
convinced...
Oh,
Christ!
She
was
raped
by
her
father.
"Internalizing"?
Okay.
Still
doesn't
explain
everything,
It
doesn't
explain
Well,
she's
a
teenager.
She's
listened
What
about
these
nails?
It
could
be
that
she
swallowed
them
She
clearly
doesn't
want
it.
What
about
the
voice
inside
her?
That
You
be
careful,
Michael.
Why?
Choosing
not
to
believe
in
the
devil
ISTVAN
:
Come.
Come
closer.
You're
not
a
coward.
Don't
be
afraid.
It's
just
your
mother.
Now...
...blow.
We
want
to
do
a
good
job,
don't
we?
The
best
we
can.
Good.
Now...

Hail

It
kicks
me.
And
bites
me.
LUCAS:

Why
not?
VINCENZO:
Because
he
says
he's
my

Oh.
What
else
does
he
tell
you?
He
tells
me...
...to
kill
myself.
FRANCESCA
:
He
woke
up
with
these.




The

from
the
dream?

The

in
the

Not

You
hit
him?
Are
you
lying?
Are
you
a
liar?
Okay.
Come
here.
Open
your
mouth.
Ahh.
Bring
me
his
pillow.



Banish
all

Ah.

Flee,
enemy
of
the

That's
enough
now,
do
you
hear
me?
LUCAS:

LUCAS:

I'm
supposed
to
take
care
...but
I
feel
so
bad.
You
ever
wonder
if
the
people
LUCAS:
MICHAEL:
LUCAS:
Why
not?
I
haven't
seen
a
prayer
So
you're
happy
to
have
them
continue
LUCAS:
And
what
is
it
you
believe?
I
believe
that
people
prefer
to
lie
The
truth,
yeah.
Certainty.

LUCAS
:
I
understand.
Thank
you.



We
gave
her
pethidine
Legally
we
can't
give
her
anything
else.
ROSARIA:
And
I'm
not
finished
yet!

LUCAS:
Let
her
see
who
is
in
command.
Demon.
Deceiver.
Speak
your
name.

LUCAS:
Because
her
suffering
is
sweet.
LUCAS:
Eat
the
flies
from
her
rotting
flesh.
LUCAS:
With
her
father's
seed.

So
you
remember
being
raped?

When
the
devil
has
nothing
I
don't
understand.


You
know
how
to
swear
ROSARIA
:
Therefore
let
us
...that
they
may
not
understand
MICHAEL:
We
know
it
very
well.
Very
clever.

It
is
I
who
chose
you.
-
Why
do
you
call
me
"doubter"?
A
liar
knows
a
liar.
Are
you
a
liar,
Rosaria?
What
is
it
you
want
me
to
believe?
There's
nothing
to
believe.
Then
there
is
no
devil
You
fear
me,
mortal!
How
can
I
fear
you
if
you
don't
exist?
You
think
you
outsmarted
him?
That's
not
the
devil.
It's
just
a
very,
very
sick
girl.
She
doesn't
need
a
priest,
He
still
has
you
fooled,
hasn't
he?
You
forgot
your
bag
of
tricks.
LUCAS:
He's
a
deceiver.

Did

send
you?

The
other
day
I
saw
her

I
need
to
know
what
it
was.

Your

whispered
He's
a

Please,
it's
very
important
Please.

:
...your

was
going
to
die.
Who
told

that?


He
says
you
know.
He
says
you've
seen
it
too.
Seen
what?
The
demon.
The
mule.

Where
are

did

I
said,
my

died...
...last
night.
Oh,

That's
awful.
I'm
so
sorry.
How
did
that

know?
I
need
to
talk
to
Lucas.

Hm?



Father?
Father.
Let's
get
you
inside.

-
I
don't
want
to
lie
down.
Then
what
were
you
doing
out
there?

I
said,
what
were
you
doing
out
there?
LUCAS

I
found
myself
walking
and
I...

think
I
did

awful.

you'll
need

what?
Go
find

Xavier.
Because
it
is
strong...

thing,
this
terror.
The
terror
is
real,

It's
real.
But
you'll
only
defeat
it
So
go
now,
lock
me
up.
Go
now.
Lock
me
up!

says
to
say
hello,
Hell-o.

don't
know
my
father.
Oh,
he
says
he
enjoyed
I'm
guessing
you
didn't
enjoy
it
-
You're
a
liar.
Your
father
died
at
4:20
p.
M...
...in
the
same
miserable
hospital
...or
passed
away,
as
they
say.
...were
full
of
panic
and
full
of
terror.
Alone
in
that
house
of
the
dead
...no
loved
ones
to
kiss
him
goodbye.
Because
you
deserted
him,
Michael...
...and
this
caused
him
great
pain,
You
hurt
him
most.
And
all
for
God.
Are
you
reading
my
mind?

Yes.
No.
Maybe.
No.
Yes.
Rerhaps.
-
Are
you
reading
mine?
Oh,
you're
so
tedious,
Do
you
think
I'm
afraid
of
you?
You
couldn't
even
stand
up
to
your
father,
-
Mikey,
Mikey,
Mikey!
-
You
don't
command
me.
Oh,
God
does.
Is
that
so?
Wow,
cool.

and
your
puking
truth!

are
nothing!

know
nothing!

should
wait

asked

you
snatch
from
this

...this

who
was
created
in...

Who
was
created
in

What
happened?
I
can't
do
it.
It's
more
than
just
saying
the
words.
You've
seen
him.
Me.
Don't
you
understand?
Then
why
are
you
here?
Something
brought
you
here,
Michael.
All
the
decisions
you
made.
You
left
your
home,
your
father.
You
came
here.
It
all
led
to
this.
It's
fate.
You're
not
alone.
What
did
you
just
say?
You're
not
alone.
LUCAS
:
Father.
Give
up.
You
don't
have
the
strength.
Just
pray,
Michael.

Well,
hello,
Angie.
MICHAEL:
May
I
ask
you
a
question?
When
was
the
last
time
MICHAEL:
Thy
will
be
done
on
earth
You
little
slut.
Don't
listen.
Oh,
don't
listen.
But
isn't
that
Not
listen
to
him?
Your
little
brother.
Leaving
him
to
rot
away
in
that
stinking
...when
he
was
being
strangled
Do
you
remember
that,
Angie?
You
will
never
forget.
So
we
do
what
we
do
with
him
now.
He's
living
in
the
land
of
misery
Oh,
why
the
tears,
sweetie
pie?
Like
laughing
boy
here.
Isn't
that
so,
Mikey?
Just
leave
her
alone.
You
think
I
don't
know
all
your
festering
You
were
ashamed
of
your
father,
You
hated
him,
he
hated
you
back.
It
was
a
charming
family.
How
could
God
possibly
love
you
No.
You
were
never
You
were
always
meant
for
me,
honey.
Enough!
Oopsie-daisy.
Close
to
home.
And
that
was
no
squeaky
angel
No.
'Twas
I.
You
chose
me
long,
long
ago...
...
when
you
were
just
an
itsy-bitsy
Remember,

You
remember,
Michael?
Remember
when
you
bent
that
cross?
If
only
you
remember.
Remember,
Michael.
Remember.
Remember.
Oh,
dear.

Yeah.
God
chose
you,
Michael.
Just
accept
it.
-
Yeah.
LUCAS:
Accept
the
devil.
No.
All
alone.
[LUCAS
SPEAKS
No!

Shall
I
pour
the
sick
and
rotting
truth
...into
your
precious,
golden
womb?
You
remember
his
strangling
screams...
...when
you
turned
your
back
on
him
You
wanted
the
truth,
little
lady.
So
how
about
you,
kissy
lips?
Do
you
feel
that
probing
around
Lucas,
listen
to
me,
please.
Lucas
is
not
here.
He's
never
coming
back.
You
feel
that
digging
and
scraping
around
Do
you
believe
in
me
now,
Michael?
Do
you
believe
in
me
now?
MICHAEL:
Yes.
I

I
believe
in
the
devil.
I
believe
in
you...
...so
I
believe
in

of
agony.

uprooted
