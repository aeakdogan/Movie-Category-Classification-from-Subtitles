didn't

My
name's
Rachel
Keller.
I'm
a
writer
with
You
want
to
know
I
didn't
mean
to...
It's
just
I
wasn't
able
to
Every
now
and
then,
heard
about
what
happened.
What's
left
to
write
about,
I
was
hoping
you
had
Well,
work
never
ends
but
I
guess
I
got
a
few.
So,
what
is
it
About
horses
in
general
or
just
those
that
go
strange?
I
read
you
had
Most
put
themselves
down.
They
drowned.
How'd
they
get
out?
They
just
broke
through
the
fences
So,
they
went
crazy?
It
would
seem
so,
yes...
or
maybe
they
just
sense
things
So,
where
are
your
horses
now?
I
don't
breed
anymore.
I
guess
you
wouldn't...
not
after
what
happened.
That
must've
been
hard...
you
and
your
wife.

I'm
sorry,
miss,
Rachel.
Well,
Rachel...
you
want
to
tell
me
what's
Do
you
know
what
this
is?
I
think
it's
a
message...
from
your
wife.
Anna's
on
this
tape.
She's
right
there
in
that
room.
You
can
see
the
lighthouse,
Where'd
you
get
that?
Shelter
Mountain
Inn.
Is
that
the
only
one?
I
made
a
copy.

I've
got
a
lot
of
work
a
lot
of
acres
out
there.
Minute
I
think
I'm
done
...another
thing
needs
fixing.
You
don't
want
to
see
this
tape?
You're
not
even
curious?
Curious?
No.
I
don't
think
so.
Mr.
Morgan...
I
can't
help
you.
Where's
your
daughter?
Maybe
she
could
help...
I
don't
have
a
daughter.
Excuse
me?
What
is
it
with
reporters?
You
take
one
person's
tragedy
and
force
the
world
spread
it
like
sickness.
Mr.
Morgan...
Tell
me,
miss...
what
is
it
you
think
you
know?
Then
leave
it
alone.

Morgan's...

What's
wrong
with
you?

conceived."
"'65,

"'66,

RUTH:
Aidan,
it's
your
mom.
:
Honey,
the
house
you
drew
Uh-huh?
...where
did
you
see
it?
Did
you
see
it
in
your
head?
Is
that
why
you
drew
it?
In
my
head?
Aidan...
why
did
you
draw
Because
she
told
me
to.
Who?
Who
told
you
to?
The
little
girl.
She
talks
to
you?
No.
She
shows
me
things.
Did
she
show
you
the
horses?
She
doesn't
like
it
in
the
barn.
The
horses
keep
her
up
at
night.
So,
she
still
lives
there?
No.

WOMAN:
to
be
crabbing
out
there,
Cal.
Your
body's
about
outlived
You
ain't
exactly
Oh...
let's
see
you
CAL:
Good
afternoon.
I'm
Dr.
Grasnik.
I
think
he
was
here
before
me.
Darby?
Darby's
always
here.
Aren't
you,
Darby?
He's
my
son's
boy.
Come
over
on
the
ferry,
did
you?
Yes.
Um...
have
you
lived
here
long?
Born
and
raised.
Only
doctor
on
the
island.
Then
you
know
the
Morgans
Do
you
know
Do
you
know
their
daughter?

What's
this
about?
Look,
I'm
sorry.
I-I
don't
know
how
to
say
this
but
I'm
seeing
things
and
so
is
my
son.
My
son,
that...
and
somehow,
it's
because
of
that
girl.
Haven't
heard
anybody
say
that

She
wanted
a
child
Poor
Anna.
They
tried
hard
for
years
but
sometimes
Then
one
winter,
they
went
away.
When
they
came
back
it
was
with
Samara.
Adopted,
they
said.
Never
did
say
from
where.
Said
the
mother
had
died
But
they
had
their
baby,
everything
was
fine...
till
Anna
started
coming
Said
she
was
seeing
things...
horrible
things...
like
they'd
been
burned
and
it
only
happened
around
Samara...
that
the
girl
put
them
there.
[
merry-go-round
Were
you
Samara's
Was
there
anything
wrong
You
mean
medically?
I
mean
whatever
you
mean.

When
Darby,
there,
was
born...
we
knew
something
wasn't
right
but
we
loved
him
anyway.
Takes
work,
you
know.
Some
people
have
limits.
So,
what
happened
to
her?
I
referred
them
on
the
mainland.
I
assume
she's
still
there.
You
don't
know?
How
can
you
not
know?
We've
been
through...
a
lot
of
hard
years
out
here...
mean
winters...
small
hauls,
no
fish...
and
that
was
long
See,
when
you
live
on
an
island
you
catch
a
cold,
No
offense,
ma'am
but
what
the
hell
It
means
ever
since
things
have
been
better.

MAN:
Man,
we're
really
going
Yeah,
the
lady
at
reception
said
Should

You
say
you're
Yep.
Richard
Morgan,

What
is
your
secret?
Diet
and
exercise,
man.
No

all
it
takes.
You

and
walk
out
and
I'll
be

You
understand?
No,
man.
I
just
want
to
watch
it.
I'm
responsible
I
have
a
system...
disarranging
it.
I'd
never...
disarrange...
Long
as
we
understand
Okay,
now
I'm
mad.
Does

say
who
was
Yeah.
It
was
you.
Come

MAN
:
Samara
Morgan,
hour
14.
Good.
Very
good.
So,
what
is
it
You
must
sleep
sometime.
Do
you
dream
about
something?
Samara?
Let's
talk
about
the
pictures.
How
did
you
make
them?
Samara?
How
did
you
make
these
pictures?
I
don't...
make
them.
I
see
them...
and
then...
they
just...
are.
MAN:
I
need
you
to
start
Can
I
see
my
mommy?
No,
Samara.
Not
until
we
understand
I
love
my
mommy.
Yes,
you
do.
But
you
don't
want
to
hurt
her
You
don't
want
to
hurt
anyone.
But
I
do,
and
I'm
sorry.
It
won't
stop.
Well,
that's
why
you're
here.
So
that
I
can
help
you
He's
going
to
leave
me
here.
Who?
Daddy.
They
just
want
to
help
you.
Not
Daddy.
Your
daddy
loves
you.
Daddy
loves
the
horses.
He
wants
me
to
go
away.
No,
he
doesn't.
But
he
doesn't
know...
He
doesn't
know
what?
Samara?

She's
never
gonna
whisper
What
did
you
do
to
her?
She
was
your
daughter!
You
killed
Samara,
You
killed
her,
My
wife
was
not
supposed
Mr.
Morgan...
What
are
you
doing?
The
whispers...
you
could
At
night.
In
your
sleep.
Even
the
damn
horses.
Mr.
Morgan,
come
out
of
there.
And
those
pictures.
Oh,
Good
Christ.
The
things
she'd
show
you.
She's
still
showing
them.
And
she'll
never
stop.
You
coming
here
proves
that.
Where
is
she?
Please.
I
have
to
stop
her.
If
I
don't,
my
son
will
die!
Oh,
yes.
He
will.
She
never
sleeps.
Wait.
No...
No!

No!
No!
Rachel!
Shh!
Shh!
It's
all
right!
Shh,
shh,
shh,
shh,
shh.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
You're
okay.
Shh,
shh,
shh!
You're
okay.
You're
okay.
You
okay?
NOAH:

SAMARA:
The
horses
keep
her
up
She
doesn't
like
the
barn.
What?
The
horses
keep
her
awake.


:
He
kept
her
here.
Her
mother
was
going
crazy.
Morgan
blamed
the
child.
So
he
kept
her
here.
Alone.
Not
alone.
Rachel...
There's
something
under
here.
It
looks
like
Or
burned.

I've
seen
this
tree
before.
Yeah,
it
was
on
the
tape.
No.
I've
been
there.
Shelter
Mountain.
RACHEL:
lit
them
up
like
it
was
on
fire.
Right
at
sunset.
Right
when
I
watched
the
tape.
That
was
a
week
ago.

We're
back
to
where
Something
led
us
here.
The
tree,
It
doesn't
matter.
We're
too
late.
You
have
to
help
him.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Aidan.
It's
up
to
you
now.
Just
use
the
time
you
have
We'll
figure
this
out
It's
too
late,
Noah!
Stop
it,
okay?
There's
a
reason
-What?!
There's
something
in
this
room!
I
mean,
it's
in
this
phone!
It's
in
this
television!
Come
on!
Tell
us
now,
why
don't
you?!


Noah...
look.








Aw,
Jesus.
How
far
down
I
can't
see
anything.

We
should
drop
something.




Do
you
think
Shh...




:



Rachel!

Rachel!
I'm
here!
I'm
all
right!
:
I'll
go
find
something
Hurry!




Noah?


Noah?
Noah!




Oh!




Here
we
go
The
world
is
spinning
When
it
stops,
ANNA:
So
peaceful.
I
know
things
will
get
better.

All
I
ever
wanted
was
you.




She
was
still
alive.
Where
did
you
go?


It's
okay
now.
It's
okay.
NOAH:
Rachel,
the
sun's
set!
The
sun
has
set!
It's
past
sunset.
Do
you
hear
me?
It's
past
sunset!
Rachel?
Rachel?
Rachel,
are
you
there?

I'm
here.



They're
going
to
bury
her
It's
over.
You
okay?
She
wanted
that
child
How
could
she
have
done
that?
She
just
wanted
to
be
heard.
Sometimes
children...
yell
or
cry
or
draw
pictures.
I
want
to
go
home.
I
can't
imagine
being
stuck
How
long
could
you
survive?
Seven
days.
You
could
survive

Come
on.
Hey.
Why
don't
you
just
Unless
you're
renting
a
movie.


Call
me
tomorrow...
...and
the
day
after
that.

Rachel?
Hmm?
What
time
is
it?
It's
either
really
late
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it.
Don't
you
have
to
be
at
work?
Not
today.
What
happened
to
the
girl?
Samara?
Is
that
her
name?
Mm-hmm.
Is
she
still
in
the
dark
place?
No.
We
set
her
free.
You
helped
her?
Yeah.
Why
did
you
do
that?
What's
wrong,
honey?
You
weren't
supposed
It's
okay
now.
She's
not
going
to
hurt
you.
She...
Don't
you
understand,
Rachel?
She
never
sleeps.






Pick
up
the
phone,
Noah.
Come
on,
pick
up.







RACHEL:
Pick
up
the
goddamn
phone!














Come
on!















Go
to
your
room!
Now!

What
do
you
want?
What
do
you
want?!
What
do
you
want
from
me?


Why
not
me?
What
did
I
do

he
didn't?

He
wants
me
to
go
away.
My
wife

AIDAN:
But

know.
She

MAN:
But
I
do.
And
I'm
sorry.
It
won't
stop.
RACHEL:
Push
it
in.
"Play."
Push.
[
high-pitched
It's
going
to
keep
killing,
She'll
never
stop.
Don't
worry,
sweetie.
You're
going
to
be
okay.
What

the
person
What
happens
to
them?
