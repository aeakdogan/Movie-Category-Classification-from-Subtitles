Strange.
Who
would
do
something
like
this?
Maybe
someone
got
upset
about
Stealing
satellite
phones
makes
sense,
You
can
write
up
charges
But
burning
them?
Youngsters?
...pulling
some
prank?
No.
They
would
have
left
a
note.
"Fuck
you",
to
their
parents....
....or
the
world
or
whatever
Not
a
bad
idea
though.
I
brought
Peggy
here
on
our
Yeah,
we
all
did.
Not
Peggy
of
course.
I
gotcha.
Last
sunset
of
the
month.
Well,
uhm,
let's
go
to
the
sign.
You
okay,
Eben?
Yeah.
Why

even
bother
with
that,
nobody's
It's
condition.
Kind
of
put
this
off
til
the
last
There's
a
lot
of
small
towns
in
this
state.
My
boss
wants
all
this
gear
inspected
Yeah,
I
noticed
it
says
barrel
for
the
last.
Are
you
sure
you
don't
wanna
stay?
Me
and
Jane
were
kind
of
hoping...
that
you
and
Eben
would
rethink
this
Thanks.
I,
uh...
...gotta
meet
the
plane.
Okay
sweetie.

I
know
you
can
handle
????
Promise
I
won't
live
on
Oreos
and
Snapple.
I'm
going
to
Seattle.
Yes
you
are
Kristen,
You
got
a
problem?
Nothing
I
can't
handle
Is
this
for
generators?
Yeah,
yeah
most.
Beau,
I'm
going
to
have
to
cite
What?
For
that?
...you
don't
have
to
cite
me.
You
don't
have
to
do
anything.
Isn't
that
why
we
live
out
here?
You
know,
for
a
little
freedom?
Happy
motoring.
Yeah,
I'll
add
it
to
my
collection.
You
know,
Beau's
not
so
bad.
He
lives
all
alone
out
there
A
little
citation
now
and
then
lets
Eben?
Come
in
Eben.
Yeah
Helen?
Something
bad
happened
to
John
Reese's
dog.

:
Well
folks,
you're
listening
to
KBRW,
...today's
the
last
day
.
And
we've
been
to
get
the
last
plane
Hey
Stella,
are
you
okay?
?????
Malachi.
Didn't
you
know
what
"right
of
way"
means?
I'm
sorry
Stella.
The
brakes
jammed
and....
...Eben
wanted
this
back
before
Oh
shit!
Was
going
to
meet
you
at
the
airport.
Wouldn't
Eben?
Well,
my
mom
could
come
down
and
give
you
Fuck,
where's
my
phone?
It's
me.
Surprise!
I
uh,
need
a
ride
to
the
airport.
What?
You're
in
town
and
you
didn't
want
to
talk?
I
had
fire
marshal
work
here,
..and
I
just
had
a
little
accident.
I'm
stuck
on
Ransom
and
355
and
the
airport
I
mean,
if
you
wanna
talk,
Billy.
Stella's
stuck
at
Ransom
and
355.
She
needs
a
ride
to
the
airport.
Stella,
John
Reese
needs
me
for
something,
Let
me
know
if
the
day
comes
What
sick
jerk
would
do
this?
Every
kennel,
every
dog
we
had.
Did
you
fuck
with
anyone
recently
John?
I'll
kill
them....I'll
kill
them.
This
wasn't
done
long
ago.
I'll
find
him.
It'll
be
okay
Malachi.
Where
have
you
been?
Uh,
I
couldn't
find
the
damn
car
keys.
And
then
I
was
like..wait,
is
that
like
Rogers
Yeah,
never
mind,
let's
go.
It
would
be
a
lot
easier,
Oh,
I
don't
really
care
for
those
sort
of
Try
your
brother.
-
Tessek?
Oh,
I
can't
right
now
Jake,
I'm
sorry.
While
you
were
busy
with
John
Reese,
about
a
vandalism
problem
at
the
Thanks.
You
know,
call
Point
Hope
and
Wainwright
No!
I
am
not
trapped
here
for
a
month.
There
will
be
someone
you
can
bunk
with.
Uh,
don't
start
Billy.
Peggy
and
me
and
the
2
girls
in
one
room.
Place
of
your
own.
It
will
work
out.
Of
course
the
process
of
staying
at
my
place...
...is
you
can
explain
to
me
and
Peggy
just
I
don't
have
enough
time
this
century
Eben,
how
you
doing?
Boy,
it's
gotta
be
10
below
out
here.
-
Eben
Can't
your
wife
bring
you
out
Bring
the
whole
tribe
up,
When
they're
ready
I
guess.
So...
I
found
all
kinds
of
garbage
Blue
jeans...bikes.
Sometimes
I
can
yank
them
out
before
The
muffin
monster?
That's
old
Wilson's
helicopter
logo,
You
keep
a
copy
of
your
lock
and
key,
Yeah,
I
put
it
in
dry-dock,
with
Haven't
looked
at
it
for
days.
They
ripped
out
the
throttle,
the
rotors...
It's
my
life
Eben!
Why
would
someone
rip
the
hell
out
of
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Who
are
you
people?
No
whiskey?
No
rum.
Alcohol's
illegal
this
month.
Folks
have
a
hard
enough
time
in
the
dark
Well
forget
about
the
liquor..
...Lucy.
Just
bring
me
a
bowl
of...
...raw
hamburger.
You
only
get
meat
2
ways
around
here...
You
don't
bring
me
what
I
want
to
eat
what
I
want
to
drink.
That's
enough
pal,
leave
the
lady
be.
Hey,
what
do
you
say
the
2
of
us
go
Now
what's
wrong
with
a
man
Come
on.
You
and
me,
let's
go.
Taking
you
outside.
I
would
like
to
see
that.
I
would
too.
And
Lucy
would
have
to
clean
up
after
More
trouble
than
you're
worth.
Hey
hey
That's
enough.
Stay
down.
Fire
marshals
office
will
take
care
of
????
It's
a
funny
thing,
you
never
asked.
So
you
missed
your
flight?
That
sucks,
where
you
gonna
stay?
Billy
and
Peggy
are
putting
me
up.
Well,
I'll
talk
to
you
sometime
I
guess.
Hey
listen,
um...
...maybe
I'll
come
along
and
say
hi
Bye
Lucy.
I
haven't
seen
vandalism
like
this
You
don't
know
how
to
take
care
Malachi
totaled
my
car.
Hell
of
a
day.
Just
you
wait.
-Where
are
we
going?
My
landlady
doesn't
want

Ahh,

be
good.
Oh,

Where's

Okay,
rock,
paper,
scissors.
Whoever

his
place.

it.
On

One,

Gabe?
Gabe?
Let
me
tell
you
what
I
got.
You
don't
work
at
the
refinery.
You
didn't
fly
in.
You're
definitely
not
from
around
here.
How
did
you
get
in?
Alright.
We
got
a
long
time
to
figure
this
out.
Jake,
come
here
a
second.
What
the
hell
is
that?
Oh,
it's
pot.
Didn't
tell
you
I
have
a
little
greenhouse
Now
I
know
why
you
wanted
to
No,
I
just
thought
you
and
Stella
would
just
It
worked
out.
Ah,
computer's
down.
I'll
call
Gus.
Strange.
The
phone's
down
too.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Sheriff.
Soooo,
sweet.
So...
...helpless
against
what
is
coming.
He's
just
trying
to
freak
us
out.
It's
working.
We
have
more
important
things
to
I'll
check
on
Gus.
Check
on
Gus.
Bar
the
windows.
Try
to
hide.
They're
coming.
This
time
they
gonna
take
me
with
them.
Yeah,
for
all
that
I
have
done.
They?
Who
are
they?
Our
generator's
kicked
in.
-
I
meant
????
Sure.
We'll
keep
an
eye
on
him.
As
soon
as
the
lines
are
back
up,
get
Billy
over
here,
stay
on
the
walkie-talkie
Gus!
Gus?
This
is
sheriff
Eben
Olson,

in
your
homes.
...lock
your
doors,
and

Is
your
genny

and

Anyone
with
a
genny
should
go
If
you
don't
have
one,
you
should
I
heard
gun
shots
Eben.
I
don't
know.
Just

I'll
let
you
know
Let's
just
have
dinner
John.
Please?
John!
John!
Ally!
No!
John!
John!
Ally!
Ally!
Oh
my
God!!!
No
way
out
of
town.
No
one
to
come
help.
-
Shut
up!
You
can
feel
it?
That
cold
ain't
the
weather.
Who
do
you
think
they
gonna
The
girl
who
takes
a
gun,
will
help
her?
A
kid,
a
sheriff's
kid?
Shut
up!
Oh,
yeah.
Thank
you
for
the
plastic.
I
can
split
it
apart
and
pick
the
lock.
No
it
won't.
Jake!
Oh,
sheriff.
Helen,
get
the
first
aid
kit.
All
right,
time
to
talk!
Who
are
you
here
with?!
Who
did
that
to
Gus?!
You
are
dead
man.
Where
are
they!?!
I
don't
talk
to
dead
men.
I
DON'T
TALK
TO
DEAD
MEN!!!
Well
if
I'm
dead,
no
one's
getting
loose
You're
all
dead!
I
can
take
care
of
that
for
now,
but
Doc
Miller
should...
No.

Wait
til
the
power's
back,
call
Doc
Miller
then.
This
fucker
doesn't
deserve
anything
til
then.
Billy
and
I
will
work
our
way
from
the
south
His
friends
don't
have
many
places
to
hide.
I'll
join
you.
Oh
I
got
it.
Only
you,
me
and
Billy
are
the
authorities.
It's
stupid
not
to
take
more
help.
We
got
walkie
talkies,
we'll
be
fine.
There's
a
tazer
in
the
back...
if
he
gives
you
any
trouble....
...use
it.

Okay?
You
drive,
I'm
riding
shotgun.
Stop
the
car.
What?
Stop
the
fucking
truck!
I
thought
I
saw
something.
-
Get
in
the
truck.
Get
in
the
fucking
truck!
Jesus
Christ!
-
Holy
Shit!
What
was
that?
Who
is
that?

Where
was
that?
No...no!
-
Helen!
Helen!
Helen,
come
in!
Jake?
Helen?
Are
you
here?
Oh
shit.
They
didn't
take
me.
Who
did
they
take?
They
didn't
take
me.
Did
they
take
my
brother?
Finish
me
off.
Finish
me
off.
Eben.
Eben,
look
at
me.
No.
What
are
they?
We
don't
know.
Wilson,
I
wanna
go
home.
It's
okay
Dad,
it's
okay.
You
keep
shooting
and
they....
...they
just
keep
coming.
How
is
that
possible?
I
don't
know.

They're
all
coked
up
on
PCP
They
don't
feel
any
bullets.
They
killed
every
sled
dog
in
town.
They
took
Aaron
and
Gabe.
They
took
my
grandma.
-
Lucy,
is
back
there
alive?
Jake?
Eben!
Who
the
hell
are
these
people
Eben?
What
do
they
want?
We'll
figure
that
out.
There's
a
generator
at
the
??????
No,
it's
way
major
out
of
town,
we
need
Now.
Charlie
Kelso's
attic?
It
has
a
pull
down
ladder,
you
He
would've
boarded
up
his
home
Which
is
exactly
why
it's
a
good
idea.
We'll
pull
down
a
board
to
get
it,
Carter.
I
want
you
to
stay
as
close
to
the
building
If
you
hear
anything,
go
through
a
crawl
I'll
meet
you
there.
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Something's
gotta
slow
them
down.
I'm
coming
with
you.
Okay.
Go
on,
get
out
of
here!
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
We
gotta
lose
this
thing.
And
go
where?
We
know
a
place.
Go!
They
seem
to
work.
Looks
well
hidden.
...the
feet
of
grandma
Helen.
Like...
...vampires,
you
know?
Vampires
don't
exist,
Jake.
They
don't
fall
when
you
shoot
them.
Well
neither
do
I.
Well,
I
don't
care
what
they
are.
What
are
we
gonna
do
about
them?
We'll
sleep
in
shifts.
We'll
ration
our
food,
and
then
We
have
2
advantages...
We
know
this
town...
...and
we
know
the
cold.
We
live
here
for
a
reason...
...because
nobody
else
can.
Yeah,
right.
Gondunk
lesz
rád.
I
guess
it's
good
you
didn't
want
Imagine...
Where,
where's
Catherine?
Dad,
dad.
Mom
died
a
long
time
ago.
Isaac...
You
should
go
to
sleep
now.
That's
right,
that's
right.
Go
to
sleep.
Thank
you.
They're
ransacking
the
Clark's
place.
They're
tearing
through
everyone's
home.
We
have
to
move!
When
do
you
suggest
we
do
that?
Now...
...while
we
have
the
strength.
Until
we
have
some
way
to
stop
them,
We
can
stay
here
til
they
find
us
and
then....
and
they
can
kill
us
all,,
or
we
can
Now,
some
of
us
won't
make
it,
but
it's
better
-
Shut
up.
So,
maybe
Denise
or
Lucy
dies,
but
that's
okay
Hey.
If
we
start
to
fight,
that
will
get
us
killed
We
go
to
the
general
store,
and
get
supplies,
We'll
never
make
it
there
without
cover.
If
we
get
there,
we
can
last
the
month.
The
next
blizzard,
we'll
be
ready.
Somebody!
Help!
Help!
Please!
Anyone....
We
need
to
get
her
in
here
-
Wait.
Look
at
the
rooftops
behind
her.
They're
using
her
as
bait.
Please!
Please
no.
No,
I
tried.

There
isn't
anyone
there.
God.
No
God.
I've
known
Kirsten
my
whole
life.
I'm
going
out.
Why
are
we
waiting
here
for
Eben?
...We
can
make
a
run
-
Shhhh
We'll
die
in
here
otherwise.
-
Just
move
We
agreed
to
???????
-
Just
move!
Okay,
okay.
John.
How
long
you
been
under
there?
I'm
not
sure.
Where's
Ally?
They
took
Ally.
Couldn't
follow.
You
okay?
My
leg
hurts.
I
know
a
safe
place.
I'm
going
to
pull
it
out.
Come
on.
I'm
really
hungry.
We'll
get
you
something
to
eat.

What
happened
here?
Shit.
Eben.
Carl.
John!
Stay
back!
John.
Are
you
hurt?
-
There's
blood.
I'm
okay,
I'm
okay.
Where's
your
inhaler?
I
lost
it.
Oh,
shit.
John
Reese
became
one
of
them.
Isaac!
I'm
walking
to
Wainwright.
It's
80
miles,
there's
no
way
to
-
Go
upstairs.
Come
on.
We
need
to
get
out
of
here.
-
We'll
die
if
we
go
out
there.
I'll
die
if
I
stay
here,
that's
what
will
happen.
What's
he
doing?
Just
keep
quiet.
-
I'm
sorry.
Let's
just
go
back
upstairs.
Is
there
a
bathroom?
Just
open
the
valve
afterwards.
Who
would've
thought
we'd
make
it
We're
ahead
of
the
curve.
Everyday
they
need
more
food,
Dad?
Dad?
No
noise.
-
Wait,
you
can't
just
rush
out
there.
No,
wait!
Stella,
you
alright?

What
happened?
Isaac
went
to
Wainwright.
Wilson
went
to
find
him.
How
long
have
you
been
down
here?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
We
should've
fought
harder...
...kept
Wilson
here.
It's
hard
to
stop
someone,
The
things
you'll
do
to
save
your
home.
We
were
like
that
once.
Weren't
we?
Let's
go
on.
It's
snowing.
As
soon
as
it's
safe,
we
have
to
move.
Canned
goods,
Stella
?????
Uh,
propane,
and
batteries.
Jake,
better
get
supplies.
My
wife
and
I
wouldn't
live
on
these
things
I'm
done
playing
with
this
one.
Do
you
wanna
play
with
me
now??
What?
She
was
just
a
girl.
You
did
the
right
thing.
It's
okay.
Who
was
she?
Does
anybody
recognize
her?
The
white-out
is
over.
We
can't
stay
here.
Eben?
Can
you
make
it
to
your
station,
How?
These
things
can't
survive
the
sun.
What
if
we
brought
the
sun
early?
Helen
had
that
operation
at
home.
Yeah,
she
used
an
ultraviolet
light
We
can
run
for
her
place,
And
hit
them
with
the
sunlamp,
while
Just
because
something
stopped
...it
can
stop
these
things.
Why
would
they
send
that
...into
the
light?
And
what
if
it
doesn't
work?
It
has
to.
I'll
do
it.
-
I'm
the
fastest.
I
weigh
less
than
you,
and
I
You've
got
a
wife,
people
need
you.
Jake.
You
think

The
little
girl
in
the
store.
Changed.
Just
so
thirsty
now.
I
couldn't
tell
you.
That
photo
is
all
I
got
left
of
my
family.
Martha
was
taking
the
kids
They
were
hit....
...by
a
drunk
driver.
Anna
wanted
to
be
with
me
so
much.
I
couldn't
bring
myself
to
do
it.
But,
I
know
they're
waiting
for
me.
I
can't
live
forever.
I
can't.
Don't
let
me.
No
Carter.
He
told
us
what
he
wants.
Do
you
see
that?
Yeah.
It's
Billy.
Billy.
It's
Peggy
and
the
girls.
I
heard
the
screams.
I
didn't
want
them
to
die
like
the
rest.
I
was
about
to
shoot
myself
too...
when
the
fucking
gun
jammed.
I
shouldn't
have
signaled
you.
I
just
couldn't
stand
being
on
my
own.
You
have
a
family.
You
don't
ever
hurt
them!
You
don't
ever
hurt
them.
Maybe
they
tried
the
utilidorm.
Gail!
Gail!
No,
Stella!
I'll

you
at
the
utilidorm.
No,

One
day
til
sunrise.
You
did
good
getting
everybody
here.
Eben.
Stella.
????
is
walking
around.
Just
had
to
hear
your
voice.
Where
are
you?
Are
you
okay?
???????
I'm
freezing
Eben.
I
can
see
the
car,
We're
coming
to
get
you.
There's
way
too
many
of
them.
They'd
kill
us
before
we
got
to
her.
We
have
to
cut
off
or
they'll
hear
you.
I'll
call
you
back
when
it's
safe.
The
sun
comes
up
tomorrow.
We're
going
to
watch
it
together.
I'm
so
sorry
baby.
I
should
never
have
left
you.
The
street's
filling
up
with
oil.
They
broke
into
the
pipeline.
They're
burning
down
the
town.
Nobody
will
know
what
happened.
They'll
just
think
it
was
some
Next
time,
they'll
take
out
Point
Hope,
Wait,
wait.
This
building's
strong.
They'll
kill
her
if
she
runs.
She'll
burn
if
she
stays.
If
you
go
out
there,
won't
they
come
Oh
dear
God.
When
they're
all
watching
me...
...get
on
the
walkie
talkie.
-
And
tell
Stella
to
run
for
it.
When
John
Reese
and
Carter
changed....
they
were
only
bitten,
they
stayed
who
We
can't
fight
them
the
way
that
we
are.
Thanks,
little
brother.
Take
care
of
Stella
for
me.
-
Are
you
fucking
crazy?
He's
one
of
them.
-
How
do
you
know?
-
Maybe
we
should
stop
him
now.
Shut
up!
Nobody
touches
him.
I
can
smell
your
blood.
You
can't
fight
them
all
Eben.
Stella,
it's
Jake.
Get
out
of
there
now.
Run!
Go!
What
did
you
do
to
yourself?
What
I
had
to.
Should
I
go
after
them?
It's
almost
dawn.
We
made
it.
The
dawn.
