What
is
it
that
makes
a
man
a
man?
Is
it
his
origins,
Or
is
it
something
else,
For
me,
it
all
began
in
1944.
Classified
mission
The
Nazis
were
desperate.
Combining
science
and
black
magic...
...they
intended
to
upset
I
was
28,
already
a
paranormal
I
could
never
have
suspected
...would
not
only
affect
...but
change
my
life
forever.
All
right,
men,
let's
go.
Move!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Let's
fan
it
out.
Your
men...
...they'll
need
these.
Are
you
a
Catholic?
Yes.
Among
other
things.
Well,
you're
gonna
need
I
abhor
the
use
of
violence.
Thank
you.
I
wouldn't
want
you
No,
three
days
too
late
for
that,
All
right,
you
guys,
Come
on
boys,
let's
go!
This
way!
Left,
right!
Come
on,
men,
let's
get
the
lead
out!
We're
close!
You're
wasting
our
time.
There's
-
Ruins,
not
rocks.
The
remains
of
Trondham
Abbey,
...the
boundaries
between
What
a
load
of
crap!
Hell,
a
week
ago,
I
never
even
heard

Move
it!
Hold
the
line.
Come
on!
Sweet
Jesus.
They
must
be
here
for
the
sheep.

Karl
Ruprecht
Kroenen.
Hitler's
top
assassin
If
he's
here,
this
is
worse
No
matter
what
happens
tonight...
...this
book
will
guide
you
I
will
not
leave
you.
I
grant
you
everlasting
life...
...youth...
...and
the
power
to
serve
me.
Ilsa!
Grigori!
It's
time.
Five
years
of
research
Five
years!
The
fhrer
doesn't
look
kindly
There
will
be
no
failure,
general.
I
promised
Herr
Hitler
a
miracle.
I'll
deliver
one.
What
I
will
do
tonight
I
will
open
a
portal...
...and
awaken
the
Ogdru
Jahad:
The
Seven
Gods
of
Chaos!
Our
enemies
will
be
destroyed!
And
from
the
ashes...
...a
new
Eden
will
arise.
Get
down!
I
was
taking
a
picture.
You
do
that
again
Listen,
the
portal
is
open.
Do
you
understand?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Look
out!
Get
down!
It's
almost
over.
No,
it's
not.
The
portal's
been
open
for
too
long.
Something
may
have
come
through.
Have
your
men
search
Spread
out
over
that
way!
Sir!
Something
up
here!
He's
gone.
For
now.
When
you
said
something
From
where?
I
don't
see
them!
Do
you
really,
really
believe
in
hell?
There
is
a
place,
...where
ancient
evil
slumbers
-
Grigori
gave
us
a
glance
tonight.
That's
Russian,
right?
Grigori
Efimovich
Rasputin.
Rasputin?
-
Come
on!
In
1916,
at
a
dinner
in
his
honor...
...he
was
poisoned,
shot,
...castrated
and
finally
drowned.
And
yet,
we
saw
him
here
tonight.
Professor
Broom.
Careful.
Be
careful.
-
What
the
hell
is
that?
An
ape?
It
was
red.
Bright
red.
Lower
your
light,
you're
scaring
it.
-
What
are
you
two
shooting
at?
No,
it's
not
an
ape.
It's
got
a
big
stone
in
its
hand.
I
think
that
is
its
hand.
Look
at
the
size
of
that
whammer.
No,
wait!
Wait!
A
blanket.
Get
me
a
blanket.
Come
on.
Come
on.
It's
safe.
Jump
down.
Come
on.
Jump
down.
It's
a
boy.
It's
just
a
baby
boy.
Move
to
the
left.
There
we
were,
an
unready
father
The
boys
gave
him
a
name
In
retrospect,
But
nevertheless,
We
called
him
Hellboy.
Look
at
the
birdie.
Speculation
about
the
origins...
Evidence
that
Hellboy...
So,
what
is
it
exactly
I
kid
you
not.
It
hunts
monsters.
The
claim,
of
course,
...works
for
the
FBI
What
you
seek
is
in
there.
This
is
a
sacred
place.
Give
me
my
gold.
We
shouldn't
be
here.
Master.
Your
eyes.
What
did
they
do
to
your
eyes?
-
Have
you
told
him
yet?
We
should.
Malignant
sarcoma.
In
the
lungs...
...the
spine...
...liver.
...how
long?
I
can
arrange
for
hospitalization
-
Make
the
time
more
bearable.
I'd
rather
be
at
home.
I
have
some
arrangements
to
make.
For
my
son.
You
can
always
get
That
won't
be
necessary.
Hurry
up!

Hurry
up!

Pat

That's

And
these
are

I
have
a
question.
In
the
pictures
of

is
it
they're
always
out
of

Why
don't

tell

A

Six

I
thought
we
checked

go!
Move!
I'm
going
around
the
back.
Oh,
crap.
Child.
All
grown
up,
I
see.
That

It
was
the

ushered

Name
this.

That

That

you're
doing?
Nobody

It's

You
want
to

It's

Crack

Oh,
crap.
What
the

is

Let
me
go
ask.
All
right,
keep
coming.
Why,
you
little...
Wait!
We're
heading
toward

Crazy

Red

You
all

we?
There's
a
big,
red
man
down
there.
That's
fine,
darling.
Not
Santa.
Well,
who,
then?
I
brought
beer.
Oh,
Red,
your
arm.
You
better
get
that
looked
at.
I
wanted
to
see
you.
Every
time
the

gets
I'm
running
out

he's

guest,
not
a
prisoner.
Your
guest
is
6-foot-5,
bright
red,
I
know
where
to
find
him.
-
I'll
get
him
back.
Don't
touch
anything.
I
need
to
touch
it
to
see.
-
See
what?
Whatever
this
object
holds.
Is
he
serious?
Don't
worry
about
fingerprints.
Professor,
they
were
here.
Who
was
here?
Nixon?
Houdini?
Jimmy
Hoffa?
Who?
Show
me,
Abe.
This
is
east-wing
check-in.
Also,
make
sure
it's

locked
up
Roger
that.
Kroenen!
Move.
Move!
There
he
is!
We'll
cover
him
from
here!
All
right,
don't
move!
Put
that
down.
Put
down
the
weapon!
Get
them.
Drop
the

On

Last
warning!
Take

out!

are

don't
want

years

back.
In

back...

finish
the
job.
We
miss
you
at
the
bureau.
Abe's
crazier
every
day.
Father's
still
mad
at
me.
Come
back,
Liz.
-
Come
back.
No,
not
this
time.
I
don't
like
it
here...
...but
I
haven't
had
an
episode
And
you
know
what?
I'm
learning
to
control
it.
I'm
learning
where
it
comes
from.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life...
...I'm
not
afraid.

Looks
like
your
ride
is
here.

Squad.
Hey,
stop.
Wait.
Wait.
Sir,
may
I
go
first?
Hang
on
a
minute.
He
barely
knows
him.
Then
he
should
make
it
his
business
Listen,
H.
B...
...I've
got
a
chance
out
here.
So
if
you
really
care
about
me...
...you
won't
come
back.
Yeah...
...I
gotta
go
too.
Lots
to
do.
What
took
you
so
long?
Come
on,
time
to
go
home.
Tape
you
up.
What
are
you,
a
Boy
Scout?
-
Nope,
I
never
was.
Hey,
Red.
Oh,
God.
You've
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
This
is
nothing.
You
know
what'll
kill
me,
don't
you?
Okay,
Red,
let's
get
you
home.
You
were
burned
I'm
lucky
that
way.
-
I
worry
about
you.
Well...
...I
won't
be
around
forever,
Damn!
Could
you
please
be
a
little
careful?
Big
baby.
How
long
was
it
latched
onto
you?
I
don't
know.
About
five
seconds.

Professor,
look.
Touched
you
five
seconds,
Didn't
even
buy
me
a
drink.

see.

can't

I
don't
like
the
term

I
just
don't.
And
"pyrokinesis"
sounds
like
I
don't
know.
Maybe
that's
right.
Not
being
able
to
let
go.
It's
scary.
I
black
out
after
each
episode.
You
hear
about
so
and
so...
...who
just
lost
control
Well,
they're
lucky
it
isn't
true.
With
me,
it
is.
My
master
is
calling
You
must
return
to
the
child.
So
once
again...

Hey,

Let's
get
her!

Get
her,
guys!
Freak!
Oh,
no!
Not
again.
Oh,
no!
Somebody!
Help
me!
Help
me,
somebody!
Help
me!

many

She
belongs
here.
That's
not
what
she
feels.
She
may
never
feel
it.
Professor,
the
girl
you're...
Professor,
Hey,
Boy
Scout...
...think
twice.
No,
listen,
I
read
her
file.
-
"Read
her
file.
"
...for
that
explosion
in
Pittsburgh.
I
could
talk
to
her.
I
think
I
could
bring
her
back.
Just
what
was
it
that
landed
you
What
was
it?
Punctuality?
What
is
your
area
of
expertise?
He
doesn't
want
me
with
him.
I
know
that
much.
-
You're
doing
fine.
Look,
he
respects
Clay,
not
me.
I'm
really
sorry,
okay?
I'm
not
your
guy.
I'm
dying,
Agent
Myers.
Like
any
father,
I
worry
about
him.
In
medieval
stories,
...who
is
inexperienced...
...but
pure
of
heart.
Look,
I
am
not
pure
of
heart.
Yes,
you
are.
Rasputin
is
back
for
him.
What
I
ask
of
you...
...is
to
have
the
courage
He
was
born
a
demon.
But
you
will
help
him...
...in
essence...
...to
become
a
man.
Pull
that
down.
She
was
making
great
progress...
...and
now
this.
We'll
be
closed
for
months.
And
it
put
a
big
dent
She's
been
like
this
Are
you
sure
you
want
to
go
in?
Miss
Sherman?
I'm
Agent
Myers,
FBI.
Miss
Sherman?
Can
I
call
you
Liz?
It's
a
beautiful
name.
Sixty
percent
of
all
the
women
Well,
it's
impressive
by
my
standards.
John
T.
Myers.
Dr.
Broom
asked
me
to
invite
you
No
special
precautions,
Just
you
and
me
in
a
taxi
That
doesn't
sound
like
him.
Well,
Miss
Sherman,
...but
it's
entirely
your
choice,
Choice,
huh?
That's
cute.
I've
quit
the
bureau
13
times.
I
always
go
back.
Where
else
would
I
go?
Over
here.
You
said
those
eggs
need
it
Well,
they
hit
the
jackpot.
The
subway
lines,
Right
below
us
It
was
abandoned
in
the
mid-30s.
There's
a
pulse.
There.
A
cistern
on
the
other
side.
Most
of
the
eggs
are
there.
There's
no
way
in.
We
should
go
back
and
request
You
guys
coming
or
what?
We
lead
a
charmed
life.
Here
you
are,
doctor.
This
should
cover
your
tail
fin.
Reliquary.
Straight
from
the
Vatican.
A
bone
from
St.
Dionysius.
Remind
me
why
I
keep
doing
this.
Rotten
eggs
This
doesn't
really
look
Be
honest,
Red.
What
do
you
think?
I'm
thinking
about
doing
it
myself.
Hey,
you
guys
find
anything?
No
eggs
yet,
Red.
What,
are
you
on
a
lunch
break?
Nothing
here.
Red's
on
the
move.
I'll
cover
him.
Damn
it,
Red.
Hey,
it's
Abe.
Oh,
God.
Bring
your
toy
over
here.
Oh,
man.
Oh,
Jesus.
There's
only
one.
I'll
fry
him
quick.
Two.
There
were
two.
Red?
Red.
Come
in,
Red.
What's
your
20?
I
got
no
signal.
It's
like
Swiss
cheese
in
here.
Sit
tight,
pal,
I'm
on
him.
Sammael,
hound
of
the
resurrection.
Didn't
I
kill
you
already?
You
goddamn
monster!
Oh,
crap.
It's
for
you!
You
shouldn't
hurt
people!
You
missed.
Hey,
chunk-face.
You
can
do
better
than
that,
My
kittens!
Please!
Somebody,
please,
get
my
kittens!
Second
date.
No
tongue.
My
kittens.
Careful
with
them!
Lady,
give
me
a
break!
Thank
you.
My
job.
Clay,
I'm
getting
a
signal
from
Abe.
Buddy,
don't
take
another
step.
Clay.
Man
down.
I
need
an
ambulance
Hang
in
there,
pal.
Man
down.
Quarry,
Moss,
do
you
read
me?
Quarry,
Moss,
do
you
read
me?
Feels
good
to
be
outside.
You
know
that's...
Please
stay
in
the
car.
No,
no.
Miss
Sherman.
Please,
Nice
view.
Hey,
a
smile,
huh?
Here.
Damn.
-
You'll
have
to
take
another
one
later.
He'll
make
it.
Not
everyone
was
so
lucky.
We
had
two
agents
die
today.
Clay
probably
won't
survive
-
Not
now,
Manning,
please.
You're
reckless.
These
men
trusted
you
Where
were
you?
I
knew
those
men
-
That
makes
it
all
right,
then.
-
But
I
stopped
that
thing,
didn't
I?
It's
what
you
do.
You
have
an
insight.
What
are
you
trying
to
say?
This
whole
thing
is
a
farce.
Because
in
the
end...
...after
you've
killed,
after
you've
...there's
still
one
left.
You.
Hey,
Manning.
I
wish
I
could
be
more
gracious,
but...
Welcome
back.
It's
only
for
the
weekend,
Then
I
shall
be
on
my
way.
Oh,
you
should
have
a
look
around.
We
made
some
changes
I
want
that
thing
locked
up,
Right
now!
Do
you...?
Now,
you
hear
me?
-
Locked
up!
Home
sweet
home.
Liz?
Liz!
You
did
it,
buddy.
You
did
it!
Myers?
Pop?
Hey,
how
you
doing?
Hey,
what's
that
on
your
wrist?
This?
-
It's
something
I
learned
in
therapy.
I'm
depressed,
one
rubber
band.
I'm
impatient...
...two
rubber
bands.
Maybe...
Maybe
I
should
get
you
Yeah,
maybe
two.
Yeah,
maybe.
I'm
gonna
put
these
over
here,
okay?
One
minute.
One
minute.
Hey,
Myers...
...you're
a
talker.
What's
a
good
word,
Well...
..."need"
is
a
good,
solid
word.
Too
needy.
Start
in,
okay?
Nachos.
Oh,
my
God.
Look
at
them
all.
Who
had
babies?
Liz,
there's
something
I
need
Will
it
take
long?
Out?
"Out"
out?
Yeah.
Yeah,
for
a
cup
of
coffee,
Are
you
going
alone?
No,
Myers
is
taking
me.
Hey,
your
chili's
getting
cold.
Not
hungry.
Is
there
something
-
It's
just
a
list.
It's
not
finished.
Well,
then,
later.
See
you.
-
Anything
else
you
need?
Well,
good
night.
Goodbye.

How

Do
you

Here
we
go.
Listen
about...
I
admire
him.
He's
a
force
of
nature.
What
are
you
two
talking
about?
What
is
so
fascinating,
No.
He's
determined,
unstoppable.
Some
people
would
call
that
cocky.
-
He's
just
strong.
Hey,
I've
got
yours.
My

he
used
to
say

love

for
their
defects.
He
loves
you,
you
know.
What
about
you?
I
don't
know.
I
grew
up
with
him.
But
now
every
time
I
see
him,
There's
hardly
a
day
that
goes
by
Even
now...
...I
feel
like
he's
here.
Hey,
wait
up.
You
like
doughnuts?
I
got
two.
-
Thanks.
That
was
nice.
-
Sugar?
No

and
sugar,

I
got
some

here.
Told
you.
She
took
his

Damn!
She
took
his

She
took

She
took

Oh,
crap.
It's
freezing,
isn't
it?
Coffee's
warming
me
up.
Well,
what
do
we
do
now?
Newark,
New

You
sound
like
a

host.
Hey.
You're
Hellboy.
I'm
on
a
mission.
All
right,
tell
me
something
about
you.
I
lived
with
my

of
my
life.
Then
I
went
to

went

Don't
tell

She's
sitting
on

That's
it.
I'm
done.
They
don't
look
like
spies.
Are
you
kidding
me?
Look
at
this
guy.
Those
shady
little
eyes,
-
Are
you
going
to
eat
that?
Hey,
he's
yawning.
He's
bored.
Yeah,
the
old
yawning
trick.
Watch
his

First
he
wants
my

see

good,

It
was

and

in

the

...will

Nurtured

So
in
return...
...I
will
permit
you...
...a
brief,
brief
glimpse
of
the
future.
He
will
open
the
portal...
...and
bring

only

then,

Every

I
died
and
crossed
over...

little

...came
back

He
disclosed
to
me
Would
you
like
to
know
it?
I
know
what
to
call
him.
Nothing
you
can
do
or
say...
...can
change
that.
I
call
him...
...Son.
I'm
ready.
It'll
be
quick.
Just
go
there
My
mom
says
that...
Look,
it's
not...
Plus,
you're
9.
You're
not
old
enough
-
All
right,
stand
by.
Liz,
I'm
sorry.
It's
Broom.
-
No!
-
No!
No,
not
him.
-
Would
you
take
her?
He
hasn't
spoken
to
anybody
Not
a
word.
He
won't
eat,
he
won't
sleep.
I've
never
seen
him
like
this.
Never.
Should
I
stay?
With
him,
I
mean?
Listen,
I'm
not
much
Three
decades,
But
I
do
know
this
much.
If
there's
trouble...
...all
us
freaks
have
is
each
other.
And
I'm
stuck
here.
So...
...take
care
of
the

have
accumulated

Many,

leave

soon
Hellboy's
coming.
I'm
not
pleased
about
that,
We
either
wrap
this
up
or
I'm
closing
Hi.
Hi.
I'll...
...come
to
Moscow...
...if
you're
still
going.
I
am.
But
I
have
something
to
say.
I
understand
I
do.
What
I
am...
...makes
you
feel
...out
there.
-
Red,
I
don't...
I'm
not
like
Myers.
He
makes
you
feel
like
you
belong...
...which
is
good,
really.
I
wish
I
could
do
something
about
this.
I
can't.
I
can
promise
you
two
things:
One,
I'll
always
look
this
good.
And
two...
...I'll
never
give
up
on
you.
Ever.
I
like
that.

better
be
the

or
I'll
puke.
You
better
come
out
and
see.

Forget
it.
We're
never
gonna
find
It's
practically
a
city.
And
it
stinks,
and
it's
muddy.
I
think
we
go
back,
we
check
After
breakfast.
I
think
what
we
have
to
do
here
We
go
in
by
quadrants.
Let
me
ask
for
directions.
Where
are
you
going?
Come
on,
baby,
find
me
a
talker.
Hi
there.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.
What
do
you
want?
This
is
ridiculous.
I
run
this
show,
not
him.
This
guy's
nothing
but
trouble.
-
Ten
minutes,
we're
out
of
here.
...and
let
him
do
his
thing?
Anybody
got
a
PowerBar?
Hey,
there
he
is.
Sixty
feet
further,
comrades.
And
three
rows
in.
What
the
hell
is
that
on
his
back?
This
here
is

Klimentovich.
Say
"hi,"

Go
that
way,
Red
Monkey!
Gotcha.
Ivan
says
there's
a
whole
network

on
for
miles.
Stay
close,
everybody.
You
better
be
right
about
this.
We'll
be
all
right
as
long
as
Hey,
Sparky.
Tell
everyone
to
turn
their
locator
I'll
say
"Marco.

Are
you
sure
about
this?
Don't
worry,
Boy
Scout,

a
tough
one.
Come
on.
Ask
your
buddy
How
you
doing
up
there,
Ivan?
If
I
had
legs
I'd
kick
your
ass!
Would
you
mind
holding
this
guy
What
the
hell
is
that?
Something
big.
-
Lime,
come
with
me.
No,
no,
no.
Stay
put!
Stop!
You
listen
to
me.
Listen
to
me!
I'm
in
charge.
We're
gonna
go
back.
Whatever
it
is,
it's
coming
for
us.
Lime,
let's
go!
Stay
put!
And
you!
I
am
not
afraid
of
you!
I'm
in
charge!
We
go
back!
I
was
better
off
dead!
Oh,
crap.
Music.
Really
went
deep.
Hey,
what's
wrong
with
you?!
You
killed
my
father.
Your
ass
is
mine.
What
are
you
laughing
at,
Don't
even
think
about
it.
That's
all
for
you,
pinhead.
What
are
you
doing?
-
What
are
you
doing?
You
never
light
a
cigar
that
way.
You
use
a
wooden
match.
Preserves
the
flavor.
You
see?
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
So
he
thinks
you
and
I...
That's
why
he's
mad
at
me.
But
it's
not
true,
right?
What?
Well,
that,
you
know,
You
want
to
know
that
here?
Now?
Yeah.
Red,
white,
whatever.
Hey,
wait
up.
Have
you
found
them
yet?
I
got
them
right
below
me.
Okay,
good.
Could
you
hurry
up?
Liz,
wait.
Oh,
my
God.
Let's
back
out
real
slow.
Myers,
ready
your
grenades.
Marco.
Marco.
Marco.
Get
your
big,
red
butt
over
here.
I'm
coming
for
you,
kid!
No
piggybacks!
Get
off
me,
you...
Liz,
no!
They're
gonna
kill
him!
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
-
Hit
me.
Hit
me.
Now!
You
should
be
running.
They
are
all
here.
All
of
them.
Just
the
way
it
was
promised.
This
one's
awake.
Thank
you
for
this.

Don't

her.
No.
No?
In
exchange
for
her

then?
Open
the

No.
As
you
wish.
No!

Her

awaits
on

choice.
Your
father
gave
you
that.
No,
you
don't!
Open
it!
Do
it!
What
have
you
done?
I
chose.
You
will
never
fulfill
your
destiny.
You
will
never
understand
I'll
just
have
to
find
a
way
Child.
Look
what
you've
done.
You've
killed
me...
...an
insignificant
man.
But
you
have
brought
forth...
...a
god.
Myers,
let's
go.
Hell
will
hold
no
surprises
for
us.
I
took
a
grenade
belt.
The
damn
thing's
broken.
Keep
her
safe,
will
you?
Whatever
happens,
I
won't.
You're
okay,
Myers.
Stick
around.
Hey,
Red.
Just
pull
the
cable.
I
didn't
get
you
anything.
Are
you
going
to
be
okay
alone?
How
big
can
it
be?
Damn!
Damn.
Oh,
this
is
gonna
hurt.
Gonna
be
sore
in
the
morning.
She's
got
no
pulse.
She's
not
breathing.
Liz?
I
was
so
foolish.
Red.
In
the
dark...
...I
heard
your
voice.
What
did
you
say?
I
said,
"Hey...
...you
on
the
other
side...
...let
her
go.
Because
for...
For
her
I'll
cross
over.
And
then
you'll
be
sorry.
"
What
makes
a
man
a
man?
A
friend
of
mine
once
wondered.
Is
it
his
origins?
I
don't
think
so.
It's
the
choices
he
makes.
Not
how
he
starts
things...
...but
how
he
decides
to
end
them.
Hey,
guys?
I'm
still
here.
Hello?
