Welcome

Onstage
at
the
Hard
Rock

In
the
northern
Las
Vegas
suburb
a
woman
leaving
a
grocery
store
says
and
tried
to
bite
her:
He

scared
off
If
you've
seen
or
witnessed
anything







Really?
Really?
You
watch
me.
You're
done.
You're
done.
Nothing
doing,
huh?
This
thing
has
got
no
ambition.
Doris,
do
you
want
some
help
Oh,
I
got
it.
Thanks.
All
right.
Good
to
see
you,
Char-Char.
Hey,
kid.
Don't
leer
at
the
neighbors.
She's
the
one
that
I'm
just
reading
it.
Is
he
ever
going
to
Oh,
Mom,
come
on.
Attitude.
You've
been
stressed
or
something.
Amy?
Amy
is
good.
Getting
what
you
want
can
be
stressful.
Especially
when
you're
not
used
You
reading
those
books
again?
Because
they're
definitely
not
working.
And
neither
is
this
bike.
Still
tripping
out
over
some
guy's
box.
It's
an
eyesore.
I'm
trying
to
get
people
to
move
in,
-
I
like
that
word.
"Legions."
Can
I
get
some
help
here?
-

When
the
Perrys
lived
there...
they
were
the
greatest
neighbors
ever,
I
thought
you
were
happy
He's
not
digging
a
pool,
so
where
did
That's
a
very
good
question.
Maybe
you
should
spy
on
him
He's
13
feet
from
our
house.
It's
merely
observing.
-
Hi,
Mrs.
Brewster.
-
Hi.
-
Oh,
hey,
Ed
called
again.
I'm
tired
of
If
you
don't
want
to
talk
to
him,
Kind
of
defeats
the
purpose.

-
Still
can't
get
the
bike
started?
So
you
don't
need
a
ride?
Amy!
Amy!
Oh,
my
God.
Hey!
-
Charley?
-
Guess
what?
-
Guess
what?
We
are
on
time,
-
You
stress
too
much.
Yeah,
you
do.
-
What's
my
"worried
thing"?
I
don't
have
a
worried
thing.
All
the
time.
-
Ladies.
Seriously?
A
mochaccino?
You
can't
ride
with
the
girls
any
more.
you
let
them
brush
your
hair,
Chuck's
secure.
Nice,
man.
Nice
kicks.
-
Puce.
I
have
track
after
school.
Hey,
Amy,
Amy.
About
the
prom.
I
was
going
to
ask
you.
You,
me,
ill-fitting
tuxedo.
No.
Nobody
goes
to
the
dance
Okay.
Yeah,
I
knew
that.
-
It's
so
not
cool.
-
Okay,
bye.

Did
you
find
Make
a
sacrifice
to
the
hot-ass
gods?
-
Just

man.
Rock-solid
game.

He
doesn't

have
a
car.

Holy

How
did
you
get
that?
She's
hard
up,
man.
Dude,
I
think
Ed's
going
to
talk
to
us.
Hey,
can
I
get
a
minute?
Just
the
two
of
you?
That's
sweet!
Now
he
can
school
you
Nice.
Don't
you
have
Actually,
yeah,
I
do.
It's
important,
Brewster.
What's
up,
Ed?
You
know
Adam's
missing,
right?
What
do
you
mean,
Adam's
missing?
I
keep
trying
him.
I
don't
know
if
you
were
but
he's
not
the
only
one
that's
gone.
Kids
aren't
coming
to
school.
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it?
Just
meet
me
at
his
house
after
school.
We'll
check
around
I
can't.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
busy.
I
don't
think
you
understand
Do
we
really
have
to
do
this
here?
Wow.
Am
I
supposed
to
not
even
speak
-
Be
quiet.
Don't
spaz
out.
You
don't
want
me
to
spaz
out?
Crossing
the
streams!
Will
high

Okay.
You
want
me
to
go
tell
your
pals
The
LEGO
contests,
-
the
costumes?
Or
how
about
that
one
time
so
you
could
tie
it
around
your
balls
-
Stop.
Okay,
fine.
Adam's
after
school.
Don't
be
late.
I'd
really
like
Stretch
back,
by
the
way.
AMY:
You
know
what
I
want
for
dinner?
You
realize
you're
eating
You
just
forced
me
to
get
you
that
they
named
a
planet
after
it.
It's
true.
I'm
insatiable.
You
are.
What
was
that
for?
Nothing.
JANE:
I'm
so
sorry
to
take
up
your
time.
Is
my
mom
flirting?
Hey,
Charley,
I'm
at
Adam's
house,
and
it's
really
weird,
Remember
those
videos
of
us
Adam,
you,
and
I
dressed
in
tights?
You
don't
want
your
new
pals

JANE:
So,
not
a
pool?
JERRY:
Foundation
problems.
Oh,
these
houses
were
It
never
surprises
me
This
is
the
third
time
JERRY:
Done.
Just
needed
a
new
stem.
Jerry,
this
is
my
son,
Charley,
and
his...
I
don't
know.
Do
we
say
"girlfriend"?
Hi,
I'm
Amy.
Hey,
Jerry.
Nice
to
meet
you.

So,
Jerry
is
our
-
And
he's
handy.
I'm
sorry
about
the
mess,
Charley.
I
was
just
saying
to
your
mom
It
doesn't
bother
me.
My
mom
was...
Jerry
does
night
construction
CHARLEY:
Oh.
You
play
ball.
I'm
always
looking
for
a
pickup
game.
Yeah,
no,
I
do.
Definitely.
-
I
do.
He's
obsessed.
-
I
play,
though.
puce.
I
like
them.
So,
I'd
invite
you
guys
inside,
-
I've
been
meaning
to.
A
drink.
Something.


Soon,
okay?
Yeah,
you
bet.
It's
the
least
I
could
do.
My
God.
Why
did
you
blow
him
off?
A
guy
that
good-looking
still
single?
Nice,
Mom,
breaking
it
down.
I've
had
enough
man
troubles.

CHARLEY:
Oh,
wow.
I
got
to
go.
-
What?
-
Now?
-
That's
fine.
I'll
eat
after.
-
Are
you
okay?
Dude,
where
the
hell
have
you
been?
-
You
said
after
school.
-
Do
you
know
what
that
means?
-
Let
me
consult
my
pocket
dictionary.
Hello?
Anybody
home?
Nope.

CHARLEY:
This
is
nuts.
ED:
I
really
hate
to
be
the
one
that
guy,
your
neighbor,
he's
a
vampire,
man.
-
My
neighbor?
Next
door?
Jerry.
I
just
met
him.
Okay.
Jerry.
That
is
a
terrible
vampire
name.
Jerry?
I
didn't
name
him,
man.
Dude.

Hello?
Adam?


Yo.
It's
Ed.

-
Jesus.
Nice.
-
They're
not
here,
dude.
I
saw
this
thing
on
channel
13
who
escaped
an
attacker
Why
are
you
walking
like
that?
All
right.
Listen.
Adam
and
I
graphed
out
all
the
attacks,
-
Whole
families,
gone.
Nobody
lives
in
Vegas,
You
live
in
Vegas.
That's
you
right
there
in
the
center,
His
windows
Lots
of
people
They
work
on
the
Strip
at
night,
Which
is
why
it's
the
perfect
plan.
What?
That
Jerry's
a
Dracula?
No.
Dracula
is
one
specific
vampire.
Dude,
I
know
what
you're
telling
me.
-
Awesome.
That's
fiction.
This
is
real.
He's
a
real
monster,
and
he's
not
brooding,
He's
the
fucking
shark
from
Jaws.
He
kills,
he
feeds,
and
he
doesn't
stop
And
I
seriously
am
so
angry

Ed?
Ed?
You
haven't
asked
him
in
yet,
Because
obviously
he
can't
get
in
without
an
invitation.
-
You're
on
drugs,
dude.
But
I
thought
you'd
take
I
have
hard
evidence
at
home.
Okay.
All
right.
Listen.
Me
and
you.
But
not
now.
It's
too
dark.
We
should
go
during
the
day.
That's
what
I
read
-
The
magician?
The
magician
in
the
bandana
-
Yes.
Yes.
He's
the
master
of
dark
forces.
He
studies
vampire
methodology.
-
Wow.
Can
we
just
pretend
for
one
minute
Evil,
this
was
fun
when
we
were
eight.
-
Try
16.
Point
is
I
grew
up.
but
don't
get
an
attitude
because
I
get
it.
You're
so
cool,
Brewster.
Go
ahead
and
join
-
and
that
includes
your
girlfriend.
She's
undeniably
doable,
but
we
used
to
make
fun
-
She's
a
skank.
We
used
to
make
fun...
Adam's
gone
and
you
act
What
the
fuck
happened
to
you?
We
were
inseparable.
You
know
when
my
life
When
I
stopped
being
friends
with
you.

What
a
fucking
asshole.

Goddamn.
-
Why
are
you
on
my
street,
bro?
You
tracked
your
nerd
juice
Really?
Looks
like
I
tracked
Oh,
yeah?
Do
I
still
got
some?
Okay.
Just
hit
me.
Really,
Seriously?
Jesus,
I
just
gave
you
You
just
gave
me
an
invitation...
MARK:

Oh!

You
better
run,
boy!

Unbelievable.
Shit!
You
back
the
fuck
up!
I'm
armed!
Hello!
Please!
Someone's
after
me
right
now!
Help
me!
God
damn
it!
Forget
it,
Jerry.
No
invitation.
Oh,
shit.
Abandoned.
I
thought
You've
been
watching
me.
I've
been
watching
you.


Shit,
Shit.
That
looked
like
it
hurt.

You
bit
off
more
than
you
can
chew.
It's
too
late.
I
told
people
what
you
are.
And
you
think
anyone's
Don't
play
that
crap,
I'm
serious.
Try
me!
Okay.
You
say
you're
glad
you're
different.
-
Get
back!
These
people,
even
your
best
friend,
-
you're
nothing
to
him
now.
You
were
born
for
this.
And
you
know
it.
It's
a
gift.
Good
on
his
word.
Kid
Comeback!
Gladiator
Man!
Squid
Man!
ED:
Come
at
me
if
you
dare!
ED:
What
can
you
do
now,
Squid
Man?

-
Hey,
you.
You
try.
My
voice
seems
to
be
Charley!
The
world
is
Kid
Comeback's!


ED:
No,
you're
already
dead.
Coming!

Hey,
Mrs.
Lee.
Rick,
Charley's
here.

This
looks
great.
-
Look
at
you,
so
handsome!
Ed
said
you
really
sprouted
up.
Ed's
going
to
be
so
sorry
-
Oh,
he's
not
here?
Do
you
mind
if
I
run
upstairs
and...
Of
course.
Make
yourself
at
home.
-
Right
up
there.

Oh,
man.
ANNOUNCER:
Peter
Vincent.
ED:
Oh,
Adam.
Here
he
comes.
ADAM:
He's
a
guy
with
a
wheelbarrow.
ED:
Don't
be
a
dick.
There.
That's
his
truck.
Fuck!
Fuck
me!
Oh,
he
didn't
look.
That's
him
right
there,
Adam.
He
is
so
nailed.
So
nailed.
-
Hey,
guy.
Guy.
-
You
could
really
do
me
a
solid.
I
got
a
girl
on
her
way
over
for
a
beer,
It's...
Sucks.
Set
me
up.
I'll
pay
you
back
two
times.
-
What
do
you
say?
Yeah,
let
me
do
that.
Right
now.
I'll
go
right
now
Okay.
-
Cool.
Just
give
me
a
second.
Let
me
just
see
what
she's
got.
Mom's
kind
of
a...
Kind
of
a
light
domestic
kind
of
a
mother.
Nice
kitchen.
Good
cabinet
work.
Thanks.
You
cool

Budweiser?
Yeah,
that
works.
Yeah.

Oh,
shit.
No!
No,
no.
I
got
it.
I
just...
Yeah,
I
got
it.
Sorry
it's
not
a
sixer.
This
girl
tonight,
she's
a
handful.
You
know?
Women
who
look
a
certain
way,
they...

They
need
to
be
managed.
It's
true.
Your
dad
ducked
out
on
you?
Your
mom,
she
didn't
exactly
say,
but
there's
a
kind
of
neglect.
Gives
off
a
scent.
You
don't
mind
my
saying,
The
two
of
you,
alone.
And
your
girl,
Amy,
she's
ripe.
I
bet
there's
a
line
of
guys
You
don't
see
it.
Maybe
you
do,
It's
on
you
to
look
out
for
them.
You
up
for
that,
guy?
-
I
think
I
can
manage.
Because
there
are
a
lot
of
Everyone's
got

Hello?
Hey,

you
all
right?
Are
you
all
right?
Everything
good?
Yep.
-
Why
shouldn't
it
be?
Did
you
ever
read
this?
-
No.
It's
kind
of
sexy,
actually,
in
like,
frustrated,
unconsummated
sort
of
way.
Like
us,
you
mean.
Mmm-hmm.
Kind
of
makes
it
hotter.
-
Am
I
boring
you?
Okay.
That's
all
right.
Do
you
want
to
Right
now?
Really?
Yeah,
why
not?
Please
believe
me,

is
nothing
than
getting
under
the
covers
with
you.
Okay.
Charley,
don't
be
nervous.
It's
okay.
I'm
not
nervous,

us!
Whoa!
Maybe.
It's
a
huge
deal,
okay?
Very
big
deal.
Okay,
Charley,
if
you're
not
into
this,
Because
you
don't
have
to
Amy,
I'm
not
doing
you
any
favors.
I
don't
trust
that
guy.
You're
so
stupid,
Charley.

No,
I'm

I'm
going
to
leave

have
fun

door.
Under
no
circumstances

right?
He's
dangerous.

I
think
I
can
handle
myself.
Don't
acknowledge
him.
and
at
night,
please
stay
inside.
Why?
Because
he's
dangerous?
I
can't
answer
a
million
questions
Charley,
stop!
I'm
your
mom,
I'm
sorry,
I
can't
do
this
right
now.
I
don't
understand.
Charley!
Hey.
Hey.
You
weren't

thought
You

Yeah.


Get

No!
Stop,

Come

fuck,
people?
Fire.
She's
supposed
to

Ouijas.
Now

Those

Agrippa.
He's
read
them
all.

-
Midori
me.
-
Fuck
you!
Come
on
in.
Come
on.
It
looks
like
pee,
but
I'm
hooked.
-
Do
you
want
some?
No?
Too
much
for
you?
Uh...
Sit
down.
So,
I'm
the
expert
for
your
vampire
thing?
They're
all
the
rage.
Leather,
it
doesn't
breathe.
Fucking
rashes
are
fucking
killing
me.

Shoot.
Right.
Well...
Look,
I
know
your
show...
I
know
your
show
is
an
illusion.
Meaning
bullshit?
-
Yeah,
fair
enough.

-
Yeah,
sorry.
Go
on.
You
want
to
know
how
to
kill
a
vampire?
Yeah,
kill
a
vampire.
Well,
let's
think.
You
got
fire,
beheading.
You
can
make
him
Or
go
traditional.
Cool.
So
that
stuff
really
works?
Well,
maybe
not
the
omelet.
How
the
fuck
should
I
know?
I
don't
know.
You
have
all
this
stuff,
and
you
are
"Peter
Vincent:
Vampire..."
-
I
don't
know.
I'm
not
sure.
You
think
I'm
hanging
out
with
Dracula?

I'm
sorry,
but
I
have
I
think
one
of
them
got
my
friend.
What?
"One
of
them,"
Yeah.
Jerry.
He
lives
next
door
to
me.
Jerry?
Jerry
the
vampire?
Do
you
think
I
don't
know
Two
days
ago
I
would
have
laughed
I
am
so
far
down
the
rabbit
hole.
I
was
in
his
house,
or
his
lair,
-
If
you
just
look
at
them.
-
No,
please.
I'm
not!
I
know
what
I
saw.
No,
you
don't.
Illusion,
remember?
People
see
You
don't
collect
this
stuff.
if
you
don't
believe,
and
I
promise
you,
I
can
show
you
What,
in
Clark
County,
That's
a
hotbed
of
supernatural
activity.
It
is,
though.
It's
genius.
It's
a
transient
population.
People
Get
this
loser
out
of
my
sight,
please.
-
Stop!
He
got
my
friend
already!
I'm
not.
I
don't
want
to
know
this
shit.
Please,
just
look
at
these
pictures.
Get
the
fuck
out
of
my
house!
Time
to
go,
doll.
Come
on.
MARK:
Dude,
is
that
Charley?
BEN:
It's
paranoia.
Once
I
thought
I
was
being
chased
-
I
know!
You
guys
are
both
ruining
my
high.

Oh,
shit!
All
right,
-
Hey,
guy.

-
Fuck...
Hey.
-
Hey.
The
whole
house
looks
like
that
show.
Yeah.
It's
a
gag
for
Amy.
Long
story.

Don't,
Mom,
don't!
How
did
you
get
in
here?
-
It
was
unlocked.
Mom,
please,
I
told
you
to
lock
the
door!
Okay!
You
are
flipping
out.
You're
blowing
everything
off.
Is
that
a
stake?
No.
Maybe.
Look.
Even
if
you
are
losing
it,
You
don't
go
from
something
You're
not
nothing
to
me,
Charley,
I
would
like
you
to
talk
to
me,
Oh,
man.
Amy,
look...

I
need
you
to
just
I'm
not
going
to
let
you
get
hurt.
What?
How?

-
Stay
there.
No!
Don't
answer
it.
This
is
ridiculous,
Charley.
Jane,
it's
Jerry
from
next
door.
Don't
answer
the
door.
This
is
my
house.
But,
Mom!
Jane,
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Just
hold
on!
Now.
Your
son
is
harassing
me.
-
Charley,
what
is
going
on?
Whatever
he
says,
JERRY:
Jane,
he
broke
into
my
house.
Is
that
true?
JERRY:
I'd
rather
not
take
this
to
the
He's
sick!
He's
deluded.
Please.
Go
get
the
authorities!
-
Shit!
Wow.
What
is
he
doing?
I
don't
know,
but
whatever
it
is,
We're
all
right
because
obviously
-
Like
a
vampire.
This
is
the
joke
for
Amy,
right?
I
can't
believe
Take
this.
Okay.
Vampire
protection.
I
don't
think
this
is
funny.
Shit.
Hey.
What
the
fuck
is
he
doing
to
my
yard?
What's
that?


I
don't
need
an
invitation
Come
on.
Come
on!
JANE:
Get
in!
I'll
drive.
Jesus
Christ,
Charley,
Mom,
just
go!

-
Is
everybody
okay?
JANE:
Nobody's
hurt?


Look
out!
Are
you
all
right?
-
Jesus!
JANE:
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
This
is
seriously
not
okay,
Charley!
Mom,
I
told
you,
-
Enough
with
the
vampires!
Let's
just
calm
down.
-
I
don't
have
any
service.
I
hate
the
fucking
desert!
Oh,
shit.
Charley,
is
this
him?
Oh,
man.
Damn
it.
-
AMY:
Oh,
my
God.
-
Oh,
my
God.
AMY:
God!
What
the
fuck!
JANE:
What
is
he
doing?
AMY:
Charley,
CHARLEY:
Keep
going.
Keep
going.
JANE:
Jesus
Christ.
AMY:
Shit.
Look
out!
What
does
he
want?
JANE:
Oh,
no.
What
do
I
do?
-
What?
-
Mom,
just
hit
him!
Just
fucking
hit
him!
-
Don't
stop.
CHARLEY:
Just
drive.
Don't
stop!
-
Do
you
see
him?
-
Did
I
kill
him?


Mom.
Oh,
God.

No!
That's
his
fucked-up
vampire
hand.
Shit!
Keep
driving,
Mom!

Oh,
my
God!
Charley,
fucking
kick
him!
Shit!
Get
away
from
me!
-
Where
is
he?

JANE:
Where
is
he?
Where
did
he
go?
What
the
hell
No!
Stay
in
the
car!
You
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
road,


No,
Charley!
CHARLEY:
Hey!
Charley!
Hey.
Please
go.
It'll
be
all
right.
Amy,
take
her
and
go!
Catch
you
later.
I
repel
you
with
the
power
Do
you?
Really?
That's
a
mighty
big
cross
The
question
is,
Get
back!
Not
the
cross.
Come
here.
You
ever
get
a
stake
I
have.
It
hurts.
But
they
missed
the
heart.
It's
right
here,
Charley.
Easy
measurement.
You
shouldn't
have
been
so
nosy.


-
Mom!
Her
head.
-
You
got
her?
-
Charley...

Good
show
tonight,
You
were
late
again
I
have
something
for
you.
Look.
You
were
early
again
Fuck
you!
I
will
fuck
myself.
AMY:
We
won't
be
up
all
night.
Honestly,
it's
really
not
a
party.
Sit
tight.
We
might
have
-
Okay.
I
love
you.
Bye.
They
only
asked
a
couple
of
questions.
I
don't
know.
I
think
maybe
you
Like
what?
"This
vampire
moved
in,
"ate
a
stripper
and
blew
up
our
house
Last
time
I
called
the
cops,
Okay.
This
is
my
fault.
You
didn't
make
any
of
it
happen.
Ed
came
to
me,
How
were
you
supposed
I
mean,
he
begged
me.
I
mean,
he
really...
And
he
was
my
best
friend.
I
know,
but,
Charley,
Yeah,
and
I
just
changed
into
a
dick.
I
figured
my
dweeb
past
wasn't
really
going
to
be
Oh.
Are
you
trying
to
say
I
just
really
wanted
you
to
like
me,
Charley,
I
knew
you
were
a
dweeb.
Do
you
think
I
wanted
No.
I
like
you.
Because
you're
different.
It
didn't
hurt
Thanks.

-
Hello?
My
place
in
one
hour.
We're
going
to
see
the
Peter
Vincent?
It's
underwhelming,
believe
me,
Mom's
very
religious.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
know,
Right?
Don't
expect
me
to
join
Whatever
you
got,
I'll
take
it.
That
insignia
you
showed
me.
It's
a
species
that
originated
They
nest
in
the
earth.
They
keep
their
victims
alive
for
days.
Snackers.
And
they
turn
everyone?
Yeah,
I
got
it.
They're
tribal
by
nature.
Replenish
his
ranks.
How
do
we
kill
these
guys?
You
two?
You
don't.
It's
a
strong
breed.

Hang
on.
Sorry.
Sorry.
-
Hello!
-
Yes!
All
right.
Send
him
up.
Ginger,
we've
got
a
delivery!

I'm
watching
my
programme!
You're
TiVo-ing
it,
you
lazy
cow!
Shit.
Douchebag.
Hi,
doll.
EBay.
I
order
things
late
at
night
So,
yeah,
some
nice
stuff.
Wait
a
minute.
Yeah.
No.
I
don't
know.
Oh,
shit.
No.
You
said
An
invitation,
airhead.
Hey,
Mr.
Vincent,
package
for
you.
Fuck!
-

Hello.
Oh,
yeah.
No,
I'm
looking
at
them
right
now.
He's
actually
quite
modern.
Jerry
dispensed
Ed,
if
you
have
a
problem,
Oh,
do
I
got
a
problem.
You
let
him
turn
me
into
this.
Stay
away,
demon.
Is
that
itsy-bitsy
little
sticky
for
me?
It's
a
crucifixion
nail.
Yeah.
That's
old
school.
Nice!
You're
going
to
have
to
get



Oh,
no,
you
don't.
Come
on!
Let's
go!

Holy
shit!
You
took
my
arm!
Are
you
enjoying
your
panic
room,
God,
you
are
such
a
pussy.
I
love
it!
Come
on!
AMY:
Oh,
my
God.
-
Oh,
my
God.
There's
more
than
one
way
out,
We're
going
to
be
okay.
All
right?
-
Yeah.
Come
on!
Damn
it.
ED:
Give
it
up,
Chuck.
If
you
hadn't
turned
out
I
might
have
tricked
you
out.
We
could
have
rocked
Sign
in,
please.
Sign
in,
all
right?
I
need
you
to
sign
in.
ED:
I
expected
more
of
a
fight
Girl's
made
you
lazy
in
the
head.
Pussy
will
do
that.
I
can
hear
you
breathing.
It's
really
fucking
cool.
I
can
feel
you.
I
can
taste
you.
You're
so...

Fuck!
Come
on!
Not
so
fast,
Chuck.
We
got
some
catching
up
to
do,
Amy,
go.
Amy,
please
go!

It's
just
you
and
me
now,
buddy.
Let's
do
this.
Nice
weapon
there,
Squid
Boy.
Ed...
Not
going
to
do
you
much
good,
though,
because
I'm
a
goddamn

Come
on.
It's
like

I'm
so
glad
you're
here.
Werewolves.
Vampires.



Bone
is
a
motherfucker,
Chuckles.
It's
hard
to
cut.
Is
this
weird
for
you?
Because
I'm
feeling
Fuck!
Bimbo's
got
some
juice.
Jerry's
here.
Do
it,
Charley.
Charley,
do
it
now!
It's
okay,
Charley.
It's
okay.
Come
on.
I
found
the
stairs.
Come
on.
Shit.

Come
on.
Wait.
He
can't
kill
us,
not
in
here.
Really?
Look
around.
Do
you
think
-
Oh,
shit.
It's
tequila
mad
T-shirts!
-
Amy!
-
Amy!
Amy!
Amy!
Charley!
Amy!
Now
that
is
what
I'm
talking
about!
Can
you
help
me?
Please?
Charley's
going
to
come.
I'm
counting
on
it.
You'll
see.
You
just
need
a
taste.
It
could
be
like
a
dream.
CHARLEY:
Amy!
-
How
did
you
get
in
here?
He's
dangerous.
You
have
to
help
me.
Yeah,
she
looks
to
be
liking
it,
then.
No,
man.
Listen,
Attagirl.
-
ID,
then
you
can...
Amy!
Amy!
Amy!
No!
No!
No!
Amy!

Shit!
How
did
you
get
in
here?
Security
is
a
little
lax
since
everybody
You,
too?
Has
he
turned
you?
Check
your
monitor,
man.
I
don't
know
if
Amy's
alive
I'm
going
to
end
him,
That's
how
it's
going
to
be,
Don't
you
understand
this
yet?
There
will
only
be
surviving.
-
Maybe.
You
think
if
you
live
and
we
all
die,
you'll
be
able
to
No,
I
know
I
won't.
So
I
told
myself
I
made
it
up.
I
was
a
kid.
Figured
it
was
easier
Made
what
up?
The
vampire
that
killed
my
parents,
but
not
me.
You
think
I
collected
all
this
stuff
Come
with
me.
We'll
go
in
at
dawn.
The
only
reason
I
survived
the
last
time
If
you
want
to
be
a
dead
hero,

You
think
I'm
a
coward.
So
you
just
bail
on
people.
Hey,
I
get
it.
But
I
don't
want
to
live
till
tomorrow
Hang
on.
Wait.
Blessed
by
Saint
Michael.
You
kill
your
vampire
with
this,
it's
Maybe
you
can
still
save
your
girlfriend.
If
it's
for
real.
You
got
a
plan?
There's
no
guarantee
he'll
be
sleeping.
To
stake
him,
you
got
to
get
close.
Torch
him.
A
vampire
on
fire
If
he's
on
tire,
how
do
I
get
Fuck.
I'm
going
to
kill
a
vampire.
Good
for
you.
Amy!
Amy!
-
Amy!
Amy!
-
You
all
right?
-
Hang
on.
I'm
going
to
get
you
out.

Shit.
Shit.
Amy!
Amy?
-
Fuck!
I
guess
I
don't
want
to
be
Let's
kill
something.
Floor
trap.
I
use
them
all
the
time.
What
do
you
think
is
down
there?
There's
only
one
way
to
find
out.
You're
going
down?
See
that?
Like
a
great
date.
Peter.
Peter.
Oh,
shit.
After
you.
AMY:
Help!
You
know
this
is
a
trap,
right?
I'm
counting
on
it.
Fuck!
She's
all
yours.
Look
at
you,
all
grown
up.
Welcome
to
Fright
Night,
for
real!
Oh,
fuck.
You've
got
your
mother's
eyes.
And
your
father's
aim.
Better.
Fuck!
Amy!
Ow!
Really?
A
pebble?
That's
it?

Oh,
shit.
Fuck!
You
know
you
should
have
There's
still
time.
All
right?
He's
inside
me
now.
Fucking
eBay!
I'll
be
the
best
you
ever
had.
The
only
you
ever
had.
Charley,
we
could
be
together
forever.

Shit!
-
You
missed.



-
How
you
holding
up?
-
Mark?

JERRY:
That
you
were
just
going
to
walk
in
here
and
put
to
bed
400
years
of
survival?
No,
Charley.
Not
likely.

You
smell
that?
It's
your
fear.
It's
intoxicating.
It's
a
very
specific
scent,
Charley.

Amy's
scent,
now
that
was
exquisite.
It's
all
gone
now,
Charley.
She's
something,
isn't
she?
I
have
to
thank
you
Well,
she
makes
me
feel
young
again.
I'm
smoking.
Yeah,
you're
turning.
You
can't
stay
there
forever,
Charley.
The
sun's
got
to
go
down,
That's
rough.
Got
a
light?
That's
your
plan?
Actually,
it's
your
plan.
Fuck.

Fuck
you!

Charley!
In
the
heart!



Charley?
Charley,
come
on.
Come
on,
Charley!
Charley,
come
on.
Wake
up.
Wake
up.
Come
on,
you
little
prick.
Charley!
Hey.
Hey.
You
okay?
Yeah.
Are
you?

Yeah,
I'm
all
right.
PETER:
You
little
Shit.
Next
time
you're
going
to
use
my
plan,


That
was
a
fucked-up
night.

Are
you
sure?
Yeah.


One
second.
Hello?
It's
me.
Just
checking
in.
Nothing,
nothing.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
for
the
new
house.
Something
actually
just
came
up,
You
okay?
Yeah,
I'm
good.
Are
you
all
right?
Yeah,
monster
free.
Good.
Monster
free
is
good.
Okay,
bye.
If
you're
naked,
Dude!
Dude!
I
know.
Sorry.
I
left
my
phone.
I'm
not
looking.
I
promise.
See?
I
can't
see
a
thing.
All
right.
It's
all
yours.
That
doesn't
narrow
it
down.
There's,
like,
mini
golf
and
sushi.
Will
you
promise
me,
I
promise.
-
Promise?
