Hell
is
a
teenage
girl.
I
guess,
I'm
not
exactly
perfect
myself.
But
at
least
I
have
my
fans.
I
mean,
I
get
letters
every
day.
Mostly
from
perverts
and
chesters,
I'm
kind
of
the
shit.
Rec
time
started
5
minutes
ago,
Needy.
Grassy-ass,
Raymundo.
Sometimes
the
letters
are
from
people
who
They
tell
me
everything
will
be
okay...
..if
I
just
accept
Jesus
Christ
into
my
heart.
I
say
the
words,
but
nothing
ever
happens.
Nobody
comes
back.
Nobody
gets
off
the
cross.
Welcome
to
the
Mental
Olympics.
They're
big
on
recreation
here.
Supposedly
it
help
us
vent
Personally,
I
think
they're
trying
to
Keep
us
sluggish,
Well,
those
J.V.
tactics
won't
work
aganist
me.
I'm
a
kicker.
K-I-C-K-E-R.
It
even
says
so
on
my
chart.
Just
one
toastem,
huh?
I
like
toastems.
Oh,
that's
good.
But
I'm
not
sure
toastem
can
provide
I
recommend
more
complex
carbohydrates...
Oh,
Jesus!
I
recommend
you
shut
the
fuck
up.
Alright!
I
wasn't
always
this
cracked.
I
used
to
be
normal.
Well,
as
normal
as
any
girl...
..under
the
influence
of
teenage
hormones.
But
after
the
killings
began,
I
don't
know!
Loose
around
the
edges
or
something.
Oh,
God!
I
hate
this
fucking
song.
This
is
where
it
all
went
down.
'Devil's
Kettle'
sounds
twisted,
I
know,
but...
The
place
is
just
named
after
a
waterfall.
Technically,
it's
not
a
normal
waterfall.
It
goes
into
this
hole...
..and
it
doesn't
come
out.
The
scientist
guys
dropped
all
kind
of
..but
nothing
ever
surfaces.
Maybe
it's
another
dimension.
Or,
you
know,
just
really
deep.
Just
two
months
ago,
Me,
Jennifer
and
my
boyfriend
Chip
were
We
were
our
yearbook
pictures.
Nothing
more,
nothing
less.
There's
Jennifer.
Only
back
then,
we
were
tight.
Sisters,
pratically.
People
find
it
hard
to
believe...
..that
a
babe
like
Jennifer
would
associate
Sandbox
love
never
dies.
You're
totally
lesbigay.
What?
I'm
Not
Gonna
Teach
Your
Boyfriend
How
To
Dance
I've
been
dreaming
of
ever
since
I
was
a
little
girl.
One!
I'm
biting
my
tongue.
Two!
He's
kissing
on
you.
Three!
Hey,
Monistat.
You
and
me
are
going
out
tonight.
Tonight,
why?
Because
Low
Shoulder
are
playing
They're
this
indie
rock
band
from
the
city,
I
saw
their
MySpace
page...
..and
the
lead
singer's
extra-a-a
salty.
Plus,
there
will
be
lots
of
other
salty
Come
on,
Needy.
I
promised
Chip
that
Boo!
Cross
out
Needy!
What
time
is
the
show?
I'll
pick
you
up
at
8.30.
My
mom
has
a
date
with
that
guy
He
seems
nice.
Wear
something
cute,
okay?
"Little
Lover's
So
Polite"
'To
wear
something
cute'
meant
something
It
meant
like
I
couldn't
look
like
But
I
couldn't
upstage
her
either.
I
could
expose
my
stomach,
Tits
were
her
trademark.
Those
jeans
are
hella
low,
I
can...
..almost
see
your
front
butt.
It's
a
rock
show.
Well,
I
can
see
like
your
womb,
so...
I
never
even
heard
of
Low
Shoulder.
Which
one
is
Jennifer
stalking?
The
lead
singer.
Girls
like
her
don't
go
out
with
drummers.
Thanks
a
lot.
No
offense,
I
mean,
..if
you
were
like
a
drummer...
..who
is
also
a
singer.
Who's
Phil
Collins?
Forget
it.
Anyway,
this
singer
guy,
Jennifer
says
he's
extra
salty.
Salty?
'Salty'
means
beautiful.
Well,
then
you
must
be
soy
sauce,
babe.
Jennifer's
here.
Needy,
quit
tampooning
yourself
That's
fucking
weird.
I'd
better
hurry
before
she's
gets
into...
You
always
do
what
Jennifer
tells
you
to
do.
It's
just
that
I
like
the
same
things
We
have
stuff
in
common,
You
guys
don't
have
anything
in
common.
Yeah,
okay,
joke.
Guess
who's
got
the
whip
until
11.30?
A
2003
Chrysler
Sebring
and
it's
all
mine.
Oh,
Hi,
Chip.
It
smells
like
Thai
food
in
here.
Have
you
guys
been
fucking?
You're
gross.
You're
gross
Fuck
you!
Let's
go
to
the
club.
Melody
Lane
is
not
a
club.
Frankly,
it's
nØt
even
a
bar,
Eat
my
ass,
Chip.
You're
just
jello
because
I'm
not
jealous!
That
place
is
disgusting.
You're
totally
jello!
You're
lime
green
jello
and
Stop
kidnapping
my
girlfriend!
Your
wish.
"Urgent"
Chip
was
right.
Melody
Lane
is
definitely
not
a
club.
Clubs
are
for
attractive
people
in
Clubs
have
DJ's
and
champagne.
All
we
have
is
a
jukebox
I
cannot
wait...
..until
I'm
old
enough
to
get
wasted.
Hi,
Jennifer.
What
up,
Craig.
He
thinks
he's
cute
enough
for
me.
And
that's
why
he's
in
retard
math.
Hey,
it's
Ahmet
from
India.
I
wonder
if
he's
circumcised.
I
always
wanted
to
try
sea
cucumber.
Jennifer
Check!
You
shouldn't
poison
yourself
It's
Roman
here
to
arrest
you,
You're
here
to
arrest
me?
You're
not
even
out
of
the
academy
yet,
Roman!
Two
more
months.
And
I'm
on
the
force
for
real.
Are
you,
eh,
gonna
cuff
me?
Don't
do
that.
Okay,
not
here.
Hey,
there's
the
band.
You
can
tell
they're
totally
from
the
city.
Yeah,
they
wear
eye
liners,
You
would
think
that,
Roman,
because
I
wish
we
had
more
guys
like
that
All
stylish
and
shit.
I
think
they
need
two
groupies.
Don't
be
so
J.V.,
Needy.
Morsels.
We
have
all
the
power,
These
things...
These
are
like
smart
bØmbs,
okay?
You
point
them
in
the
right
direction
Hi.
Hi.
Um,
I
just
wanted
to
meet
you...
..or
something?
And..this
is
my
friend.
Hi.
I'm
Nikolai,
and
this
is...
..this
is
my
band.
Low
Shoulder.
Yeah,
we
heard..I
heard
of
that
band...
You
play
instruments
really...
..super
good.
Thank
you,
we're
professionals.
Hey,
sorry...
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
Why
would
you
want
to
play
all
the
way
out
You
live
in
city,
right?
Yeah.
But,
you
know
what...
I
think
it's
really
important
sometimes
to
try
..shitty
areas
too.
That's
amazing.
Can
I-Can
I
buy
you
a
drink?
They
have
this
really
awesome
It's
red,
white
and
blue,
..or
it
turns
brownish.
Okay.
I'll
be
right
back.
Okay!
How-how
you're
gonna
get
alcohol?
I'll
just
play
hello
titty
with
the
bartender.
Dirk,
what
about
her?
Who,
Jan
Brady?
No,
man!
Fuck
you!
I'm
talking
about
the
one
who
just
went
..butter-face
princess.
I
don't
know!
Seriously,
..there's
always
that
girl,
if
they
show
it
off,
You
told
us,
you
were
from
Brooklyn.
My
point
is,
this
girl's
definitely
a
virgin.
Now,
I
know
girls
like
that...
Well,
you
know,
we
didn't
turn
all
the
So...
Hey!
That's
my
best
friend
you're
talking
about.
And
you're
right,
she
is
a
virgin,
And
not
be
sleeping
with
creeps
like
you.
The
second
one
isn't
full
enough.
Those
guys
are
rank,
Jen.
You
know
what?
Only
because
he
thinks
you're
a
virgin.
What?
I'm
not
even
a
backdoor-virgin
anymore,
And
by
the
way,
that
hurts.
I
couldn't
even
go
to
flags
the
next
day.
I
had
to
stay
home
and
sit
on
a
Oh,
God!
Good
evening,
Devil's
Lake.
You're
absolutely
right
at
it.
"Through
the
Trees"
All
alone
in
an
empty
room,
Nothing
left
but
the
memories
of
when...
..I
had
my
best
friend.
I
don't
know
how
we
ended
up
here,
I
don't
know
but
it's
never
been
so
clear,
We
made
a
mistake,
dear.
And
I
see...
..the
broken
glass
in
front
of
me.
I
see...
..your
shadow
hanging
over
me.
And
your
face,
I
can
see...
Through
the
trees,
I
will
find
you.
I
will
heal
the
ruins
left
inside
you,
Because
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
Until
I'm
set
free.
Go
quiet
through
the
trees.
I
remember
how
we
used
to
talk,
About
the
places
we
would
go
when...
..we
were
off.
And
all
that
we
were
gonna
find.
And
I
remember
our
seeds
grow,
And
how
you
cried
when
you
saw...
..the
first
leaves
show.
Hey,
get
out
of
there.
I
know
where
to
go.
It's
okay,
okay,
Jen.
Jennifer?
I
have
been
looking
everwhere
for
you
two.
This
sucks!
You
want
to
head
somewhere
safer,
What?
I'm
in
survival
mode,
right
now.
..and
right
now,
I
feel
like
that's
my
van.
Okay...
Okay,
this
will
help
with
the
shock.
Are
you
shocked?
No.
Jennifer?
Hey!
Let's
go,
Jennifer.
Let's
go
to
the
van.
Needy,
let's
go
see
his
van.
We
have
the
Sebring,
Needy,
just
stop
it.
Just
shut
up!
I
watched
her
get
into
that
van
and
I
knew
He
was
skinny
and
twisted
..like
this
petrified
tree
I
saw
Hey,
Niedermeyer.
What
wrong?
She
ran
off
with
that
rock
band.
You're
okay,
right?
There
was
this
huge
stampede
and...
All
the
people
who
fainted
got
run
over.
And
you
could
hear
their
bones
breaking.
And
the
people...
Like..the
people
on
fire
just
smelled
like...
This
is
crazy.
They
took
her
in
their
spooky
van
with
Did
you
get
the
make
and
model?
She's
still
in
there.
Who
cares
about
Jennifer
and
..with
their
douchebag
haircuts
and
People
just
burned
to
death.
Oh,
cheese
and
fries!
I'm
alone
and
I'm
freaked
out.
Swing
shift.
Stay
on
the
phone
with
me,
okay?
Needy,
you
want
me
to
come
over?
Maybe.
Needy?
Chip,
there's
no
one
here.
So
strange.
Maybe
I'm
going
crazy.
Probably
nothing.
Look,
I'll
call
you
later.
Hi.
What
happened?
Jen?
Jen?
My
mom
got
that
at
Boston
market
and...
Um,
it's
on
your
lips...
Jennifer...
Jennifer?
Are
you
scared?
Jennifer!
There's
a
body
in
here.
I
heard
Needy
and
Jennifer
were
there.
And
they
had
to
fight
their
way
out
Look,
she's
not
even
mØving.
It's
called
post-traumatic
stress
disorder.
My
Dad
was
in
operation
during
freedom...
..and
he
totally
like,
stopped
talking,
I'll
be
Perfect
Prom
Barbie,
Why
I
should
be
ugly
Ashley?
What
wrong,
Jennifer?
Don't
tell
my
mom
about
this.
I
never
tell
on
you.
Where's
it
at,
Monistat?
You're
alright.
I
saw
last
night
in
my
house...
You
remember,
when
we
were
..and
you
totally
thought
there
was
..but
it
was
just
two
guys
with
People
died,
Jennifer.
National
news.
Anybody
that
we
know?
We
know
everyone!
Sucks
to
be
them,
I
guess.
What
is
wrong
with
you?
Besides
the
obvious
surface
flaws.
I
knew
it
was
real.
I'd
been
up
all
night
scrubbing
the
Shoot.
It's
one
of
your
more
freakish
..and
that
makes
us
both
look
like
Eww,
fuck,
you
need
a
mani
bad.
You
should
find
a
Chinese
chick
This
is
a
dark...
..dark
day
for
Devil's
Kettle.
And
believe
me,
you.
..some
pretty
heavy
stuff.
We
lost
8..precious
students...
..including,
Ahmet,
from
India.
Several
parents,
and
our
beloved
..Ms.
Erickson.
Now
more
than
ever,
..who's
the
cool
dude,
We
can't
let
that
damn
fire
win.
They
already
won.
God
bless
you,
kids.
No
band
practice
today.
It's
surreal,
right?
I
mean,
when
just
one
person
dies
in
I
feel
guilty
just
breathing.
Word.
Chip,
I
need
to
tell
you
something.
It's
about
Jennifer.
Well,
you
know
how
last
night
we
were
talking
Well,
It
was
Jennifer!
I
mean,
she
looked
like,
she'd
been
And
then
she
barfed
up
this
like
disgusting...
..prickly
stuff
that
looked
like
a
roadkill...
..and
like
sewing
needles
mixed
together.
She'd
probably
just
inhaled
a
whole
bunch
No,
Chip!
No,
it
was
like...
It
was
like
evil!
Needy,
I
think
you
might
want
to
I'm
not
saying
that
to
be
a
dillhole.
Yeah,
but
don't
tell
whoppers
and
I
didn't
say
you
were
crazy.
..everybody's
a
little
messed
up
about
this.
Discombobulated?
Hi,
needy.
I
heard
you
were
there
last
night,
Yeah.
I'm
glad,
you
didn't
die.
Thanks.
Seriously.
How
are
you
friends
with
Colin
Gray?
I
thought
Colin
Gray
only
talked
I
just
am.
We
have
composition
together.
He's
like
all
dark
and
emotional
Well,
I'm
like
that
too,
I'm
not
all
obvious
about
it
like...
..a
poseur.
Walk
me
home?
You
got
it,
baby.
"Sacred
Heart
"
Hi.
Jennifer.
I'm
crazy-sorry
about
your
profound
loss.
You're
crying
about
Craig,
right?
He
was
my
best
friend.
You
know,
I
was
there
last
night.
And
I
was
probably
the
last
person
Like,
ever.
You-You
know
what
he
said?
Craig
said
that
he
always
thought
..would
make
a
totally
banging
couple.
Isn't
that
so
weird?
He-He
said
banging?
Feel
my
heart,
Jonas.
I
think
it's
broken.
Mine
too.
You
come
with
me,
It's
what
Craig
would
have
wanted.
Yeah.
You're
so
warm..
Why
are
you
so
warm?
Jennifer.
Jen...
Look.
They're
waiting.
Uh,
okay.
Do
you
miss
Craig?
Of
course.
Well,
you're
gonna
see
your
buddy
What?
You
mean
like
in
heaven
someday?
Nope.
Oh,
God!
Let
it
all
out,
kids.
"Teenagers"
You
want
some
baloney,
Specter?
And
that
was
Low
Shoulder...
..the
local
band
who
became
the
unlikely
..in
Devil's
Kettle
last
night.
Eyewitnesses
say
the
boys
helped
numerous
..risking
their
own
lives
in
the
process.
That's
rock
n'
roll
with
a
conscience,
And
guess
what?
We're
honoured
to
have
Low
Shoulder
How
are
you
guys
holding
up?
Maintaining,
man.
It's
not
easy,
but
you
know
..are
people
in
Devil's
Lake.
I
just
hope
we
can
get
their
one
tad
..and
spear
it
on
our
upcoming
album.
Virgin
Mother!
Crap.
Hi,
Mom.
I
didn't
know
you
were
up.
Yeah.
Oh,
God,
I
had
another
one
of
Well,
it's
4
o'clock.
So
technically
you
had
a
day
terror.
What
did
you
dream
about?
I
dreamed
some
bad
people
who
were
..with
hammers
and..
..big
stakes
and
shit.
Just
like
JC.
But
I
didn't
let
them
get
you.
Because
I'm
a
hard-assed,
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
Now,
you
say
that.
But
one
day
you're
gonna
be
crying
out
"Celestial
Crown"
..a
terrific
fire
destroyed
the
popular
local
Yeah?
Goody
for
you.
You
know,
when
you
kiss
your
boyfriend
..and
it
feels
like
your
entire
body
Yeah.
It's
that
good.
Well,
that's
nice.
I'm
little
bit
depressed
about,
you
know,
..the
giant
smoldering
funeral
pyre
Move
on
dot
org,
Needy!
Life
is
too
short
to
be
mopping
around
about
That's
sweet,
Jen.
You
know,
I
tell
it
like
it
is.
You
should
be
happy
for
me,
..Jesus
invented
the
calendar.
Jesus
didn't
invent
the
calendar.
Whatever.
The
other
line,
hold
on.
It
will
just
be
a
min.
I'm
crossing
you
out.
Hey!
I
need
to
see
you
right
now.
Because
Camille
is
playing

Knock

off,
Camille!
Can

meet
at
McCullum
in
ten?
You

it
off,
Chip!
Fifteen?
"New
in
Town"
I
gotta
go.
Okay.
I
gonna
meet
Chip
at
McCullum
Park.
You
know,
Chip
is
looking
really
cute
So
tell
me,
is
he
like
packing
some
What's
the
story
down
there?
I
gotta
go.
Why
are
the
cops
at
your
house?
They're
at
Jonas
Kozelle's
house.
Why?
He
tried
to
sell
fake
papers
to
No,
Needy,
he
was
murdered.
What?
Someone
ripped
Jonas
limb
from
limb
Ate
parts
of
him.
No
one's
supposed
to
know
yet.
But
my
father
just
went
over
there
His
mom
is
like
catatonic.
She's
just
staring
out
the
front
window
like
This
can't
be
a
coincidence.
What
you
talking
about,
Needy?
And
now
a
cannibal
psycho
takes
down
It's
freaktarded.
Well,
the
bad
luck's
gotta
be
over,
right?
I
mean,
it
can't
get
any
worse,
right?
I
mean,
you
agree,
right?
You're
shaking.
I'm
cold.
It's
very
cold
out
here.
"Through
the
Trees"
All
alone
in
an
empty
room.
The
days
marched
on
as
usual,
..but
most
of
us
were
too
numb
Most
of
us.
I
don't
know
how
we
ended
up
here.
I
don't
know
but
it's
never
been
so
clear.
We
made
a
mistake,
dear.
To
the
rest
of
the
world
we
were
famous.
Our
town's
only
bar
had
burned
to
the
ground.
And
our
star
line-backer
was
The
whole
country
got
a
huge
tragedy
boner
And
the
press.
oh,
God!
They
couldn't
get
enough
of
our
little
Through
the
trees.
I
will
find
you.
I
will
heal
the
ruins
left
inside
you.
Because
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
Until
I'm
set
free.
Go
quiet
through
the
trees.
Still,
we
were
healing.
Like
Chip,
we
figured
things
could
We
had
faith.
We
were
fucking
idiots.
Before
the
period
ends,
I
would
like
to
As
you
all
know,
today
is
the
..the
tragedy
at
Melody
Lane,
..and
the
murder
of
Jonas
Kozelle.
Boring.
As
I
was
saying,
Jennifer...
..and
Needy.
I
finally
got
some
good
news
to
The
members
of
the
rock
n'
roll
group
..have
decided
to
extend
a
helping
hand
As
you
all
know,
their
song...
'Through
the
trees'
..has
become
our
unofficial
anthem
And
they
have
decided
to
release
it
3%
of
the
profits
will
go
to
local
families
What
about
the
other
97%?
I
mean,
that's
just
crass.
Right?
Crass.
It
means
greedy.
Exploitative.
Low
Shoulder
are
American
heroes.
I
was
there,
Chastity.
They
didn't
helped
anybody
escape
the
fire.
I
don't
even
know
how
that
Rumor?
Rumor?
It's
true!
It's
on
the
Wikipedia.
We
wouldn't
even
know
who
they
were
They
used
by
us.
Girls?
We
need
them
now
more
than
ever.
That's
enough.
I'm
already
sick
of
that
song.
Could
the
bass
be
any
lower
in
the
mix?
..but
you
really
look
tired.
Is
everything,
okay?
I
feel
like
boo-bbo.
My
skin
is
breaking
out
and
Oh,
God.
It's
like
I'm
one
of
the
normal
girls!
Are
you
PMS-ing
or
something?
PMS
isn't
real,
Needy.
It
was
invented
by
the
boy-run
media
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.
It's
just
wearing
off
or
something.
Hello,
Needy.
Hi.
Jennifer.
Hey,
Collin.
Can
I
borrow
your
English
homework
again?
I
forgot
to
read
Hamlet.
Is
he
gonna
fuck
his
mom?
I
don't..I
don't...
I
sort
of
wanted
to
ask
you
something.
You
want
to
know
if
I'll
go
out
with
you?
Yeah!
What?
How-How
did
you
know?
Okay.
Well,
we
have
been
having
a
lot
fun
..and
I
thought
maybe
you
would
like
to
go,
..or
something.
There's
a
midnight
showing
of
Rocky
Horror
I
don't
like
boxing
movies.
Yeah,
but..
Fucking
boxing
movie.
Fuck
it,
okay.
That
was
random.
I'm
used
to
boys
asking
me
out,
Needy.
Collin's
really
nice.
He's
into
maggot-rock.
My
dick
is
bigger
than
his.
You
do?
Wait!
Collin?
Why
don't
you
just
come
by
I
just
got
Aquamarine
on
DVD.
I
guess
she
has
sex
through
her
blowhole
Okay.
Great!
Yeah.
Okay,
I'll
text
you
my
address.
Cool.
Hi.
Hi,
Chip.
Get
a
room.
So
talking
to
your
mysterious
pal
No.
He
was
asking
Jennifer
out
on
a
date.
So,
you're
gonna
come
over
tonight?
Sure.
I'd
like
that.
I
went
to
Super
Target
and
Thanks.
Oh,
no.
I
didn't
assume
that.
Well,
I'm...
Okay,
I'll
see
you
tonight
then.
Okay.
For
ambiance.
It's
Jamming
Jasmine.
My
mom
has
holiday
scents
too,
No,
this
is
nice.
In
fact,
I've
made
a
career
out
of
it.
I've
always
thought
the
left
was
But
when
it
comes
to
you,
It's
only
a
matter
of...
"Time"
..of
time.
"I
Can
See
Clearly
Now"
I
can
see
clearly
now,
the
rain
is
gone.
I
can
see
all
obstacles
in
my
way.
Gone
are
the
dark
clouds
that
had
me
blind.
It's
gonna
be
a
bright,
bright.
I
think
I
can
make
it
now,
the
rain
is
gone.
All
of
the
bad
feelings
have
disappeared.
Here
is
the
rainbow
I've
been
praying
for.
It's
gonna
be
a
bright,
bright.

Slippery
Swirl?
Yeah,
it's
supposed

make
it
feel
good
Cool!
Baby
you

a
phatty,
the
type
I
like
to
marry.
Wanting
to
just
give
you
everything
Because
I'm
loving
the
way
Bouncing,
got
me
tipping
my
glass.
Normally
dont
get
caught
up
too
fast.
But
I
got
a
thing
for
you.
I
see
you
winding
and
grinding
up
on
the
floor.
I
know
you
see
me
looking
at
you
and
I
wanna
love
you,
love
you,
I
wanna...
I
wanna
love
you,
love
you,
You
made
it.
What's
going
on?
This...
This
isn't
really
your
house,
is
it?
No,
baby.
This
is
our
house.
Just
for
you
and
me.
We
can
play
Mommy
and
Daddy.
Do
you
even
know
my
last
name?
Silly.
I've
been
sending
you
signals
all
year.
Couldn't
you
tell?
You
give
me
such
a
wettie.
Put
it
in.
Jennifer!
What?
Are
you
scared?
I
mean,
I
thought
boys
like
yØu
were
Death
and
shit.
Here
you
go.
Nice
hardware,
ace.
No
way...
Shit!
Oh,
puncture
wound!
God,
that's
so
emo.
I
need
you
frightened.
I
need
you
hopeless.
Hopeless!
What?
What?
Am
I
hurting
you?
Am
I
too
big?
What?
Needy!
What's
wrong?
Is
it
something
I
did?
Mommy!
Mommy?
Are
you
scared?
Hi.
Hi,
Needy!
You're
such
a
cliche.
But
we
always
share
your
bed
when
I'm
not
gonna
bite
you.
How
may
you
own
that
T-shirt?
What
the
fuck
is
happening?
I
have
never
heard
you
drop
You!
I
saw
you!
I
saw
you!
Slow
down,
tardy
slip.
I'm
gonna
call
the
police.
Oh,
okay!
Why
don't
you
narc
me
out.
I've
the
cops
in
my
back
pocket,
Needy.
I'm
fucking
a
cadet,
remember?
What
you
want
from
me?
Just
only
explain
some
things
to
you.
Besides,
best
friends
don't
keep
secrets.
Incase,
you
remember
the
night
of
the
fire?
I
got
really
messed
up.
And
those
guys
from
Low
Shoulder.
Totally
evil.
They
are
basically
like
agents
of
Satan
"Finishing
School"
Where-Where
are
we
going?
You
don't
have
to
talk,
Are
you
guys
rapists?
Oh,
God!
I
hate
girls.
Are
you
even
sure
she's
Yes!
I'm
virign!
I
never-never
even
done
sex.
So..you
guys
find
somebody
who
does.
Know
how.
See,
Dirk?
I
told
you,
man.
What
did
they
do
to
you?
Just
let
me
finish.
So
they
drove
me
out
to
the
falls.
And
I
kept
looking
for
a
way
to
escape
but...
..it's
really
dark
out
there.
Where
are
you
going,
huh?
We
got
a
waxing
moon
tonight,
you
guys.
Just
like
the
ritual
said.
Why
don't
you
guys
have
something
to
Dirk,
get
a
knife
and
tie
it
well.
Because
I
don't
want
it
to
get
uncord.
I
don't
know
if
we
should
go
Dirk.
You
wanna
work
in
musical
copy
forever?
Okay?
You
wanna
be
a
big
loser
or...
..do
you
wanna
be
rich...
..and
awesome
like
that
guy
from
Maroon
5?
Maroon
5.
Okay,
so
I
thought.
Go
and
fetch
me
the
ritual,
brother.
Thank
you.
Alright.
That's
it?
We
come
here
tonight
to
What's
your
name
again?
My
name
is
Jennifer.
Super.
We
come
here
tonight...
..to
sacrifice
the
body
of
Jennifer
Please,
please...
Please
let
me
go.
I'll
do
anything.
Do
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
make
it
There's
so
many
of
us,
We're
all
so
cute
and
it's
like
if
you
don't
..or
some
retarded
soundtrack,
Satan
is
our
only
chance.
We're
in
league
with
the
beast
now.
And
we
have
to
make
a
really
And
to
do
that,
we're
going
to
And
bleed
you.
And
Dirk
here
is
gonna
wear
your
face.
Relax,
I'm
kidding
about
the
face.
The
rest
is
gonna
happen
though.
You
know
what?
I
think
as
a
fan
that
would
be
With
the
deepest
malice,
We
deliver
this
virgin
unto
thee.
Dude,
that
is
a
hot
murder
weapon.
It's
a
bowie
knife.
Bowie?
Nice.
Alright,
here
we
go!
Help
me
please..please..
Wait
a
sec!
Jen.
Jen,
you're
the
girl
for
me.
You
don't
know
me.
I
tried
to
call
you
before,
I
used
my
imagination.
But
I
was
disturbed.
Jenny,
I
got
your
number.
I
need
to
make
you
mine.
Jenny,
dont
change
your
number,
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....
They
killed
you.
I'm
still
here,
aren't
I?
I
mean,
they
did
go
Benihana
And
it
should
have
killed
me
but...
..for
some
reason...
..it
didn't.
Maybe
it
did.
Anyway,
I
don't
really
remember
I
just
know
that
I
woke
up
and...
..I
found
my
way
back
to
you.
I
remember.
I
couldn't
bring
myself
to
hurt
you.
I
mean,
I'm
a
really
good
friend.
I
was
just
so
hungry.
Ahmet!
You
made
it
out?
Are
you
lost?
Does
your
host
family
know
that
Does
anyone
know
you're
alive?
You
come
with
me.
We
will
sort
this
out.
And
ever
since
then,
I
just
knew
what
And
when
I'm
full,
like
I'm
right
now.
..unkillable.
Like
I
can
do
shit
like
this.
It's
really
cool.
It's
like
some
X-Men
shit,
right?
What
do
you
mean,
when
you're
full?
What
about
my
mom's
Kia?
Why
were
you
covered
in
blood?
You
didn't
even
look
human.
You
know,
Needy,
maybe
you
should
..disturbing
thoughts.
..that
you're
having.
Especially,
Chip.
I
think
he
may
be
having
Leave!
Come
on,
Needy.
We
can
play
'boyfriend/girlfriend'
What
are
you
doing?
See
you
at
school.
We're
gathered
here
to
celebrate
Who
was
plucked
from
the
prime
They
did
a
big
memorial
assembly
And
we
had
to
watch
another
..and
the
buddy
system
and
But
nobody
seemed
to
care
anymore.
Sorrow
was
last
week's
emotion.
Sure
we
all
hope
this
would
be
But
I
knew
better.
So
I
did
some
research.
Paranormal
research.
OFFERING
A
VIRGIN
TO
SATAN.
..forever
feed
on
flesh
to...
Destroying
a
demon.
Demons
are
weakest
when
hungry.
But
a
blade
to
the
heart
is
the
Jennifer
and
I
hadn't
spoken
since
Actually,
I
hadn't
really
spoken
to
anyone.
Hey.
I
just
bought
our
formal
tickets.
Did
you
make
reservations
at
Chip,
I
can't
go
to
the
dance
What?
Why?
Look,
just
trust
me.
You
shouldn't
go
at
all.
What're
you
talking
about?
What's
going
on?
Please,
Chip.
Is
this
about
Jennifer?
But
I
promise
you
this
is
the
last
time...
A
lot.
As
a
person,
not
just
some
girl
And-And
I'm
scared
of
what's
You're
acting
really
fucked
up.
Okay.
Jennifer's
evil.
I
know.
No,
I
mean,
she's
actually
evil.
Not
high
school
evil.
I've
been
through
the
occult
section
Our
library
has
a
occult
section?
Yeah,
its-its
really
small...
You
have
to
read
this.
Demon...
It's
something
that
happens...
..when
you
try
to
sacrifice
..without
using
an
actual
virgin.
The
guys
from
the
band...
..tried
to
sacrifice
her
in
the
woods.
But
what
they
didn't
know...
..is
that
she
hasn't
been
a
virgin
It
all
makes
sense
now.
If
the
human
sacrifice
is
impure,
..the
result
may
still
be
obtained.
But
a
demon
will
ever
reside
in
the
She
must
forever
feed
on
flesh
Okay.
They
like
make
her
really...
..pretty
and
glowy...
..and
her
hair
looks
amazing.
And
then
when
she's
hungry,
I
mean
like
ugly
for
her.
So,
you
get
it?
The
dance.
It'll
be
like
an
all-you-can-eat
buffet.
Needy,
I
think
you
need
help.
Oh,
my
God!
It's
not
that
I
don't
believe
you,
God,
this
is
a
nightmare.
And
what
about
the
dance?
Who
cares
about
the
goddamn
dance,
Chip?
I
ordered
your
corsage,
It
was
like
$12.
I'll
be
at
the
dance.
I
just
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
Jennifer.
Promise
me,
you're
not
gonna
go.
Needy,
I...
..I'm
not
your
guy
anymore?
Chip,
it's
not
safe
for
us
to
be
"Finishing
School"
You
hit
me
once,
You
gave
a
kick,
You
smashed
a
plate
over
my
head.
Then
I
set
fire
to
our
bed.
You
hit
me
once,
You
gave

kick,
You
smashed
a
plate
over
my

Then
I
set
fire
to

You
hit
me
once,
You
gave

Truthfully

In
my
underpants,

What,
Mom?
Ladies's
pepper
spray?
There's
obviously
a
sicko
out
there
Mom,
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
Did
you
hear
what
Colin
Gray
looked
like
Lasagna
with
teeth?
You
picking
Needy
up
at
her
house?
I'm-I'm
meeting
her
at
the
dance.
I
want
pictures
with
your
sister
Yes,
ma'am.
"New
Perspective"
Stop
there
and
let
me
correct
it.
I
wanna
live
a
life
from
a
new
perspective.
You
come
along
because
I
love
your
face.
And
I'll
admire
your
expensive
taste.
And
who
cares
divine
intervention.
I
wanna
be
praised
from
a
new
perspective.
Okay,
one
more.
Back
to
back.
Big
smiles.
Chees-s-s-e.
"Death"
I
wonder
what
keeps
us
so
high
up.
Could
there
be
a
love
beneath
these
wings.
If
we
suddenly
fall
should
I
scream
out?
Keep
very
quiet
and
cling
to
So
frightened
of
dying,
Relax,
yes,
I'm
trying,
But
fears
got
a
hold
on
me.
Yes,
this
fears
got
a
hold
on
me.
Here,
we
all
are...
Quiet-Quiet
now,
please.
Boys?
Thank
you.
Welcome...
..to
the
Spring
Prom.
Chip!
Didn't
you
hear
me
calling
your
name?
You
weren't
calling
my
name.
Yes,
I
was.
I-I
couldn't
hear
it.
Listen,
I
need
to
talk
to
you
Our
little
Needy.
I
hope
everybody
had
enough
..Pecan
Sandies...
..and
Cran-Grape...
..that
was
so
generously
donated
But
the
real
treat
is
yet
to
come.
She's
been
acting
a
little
off
lately.
Look,
I
think
I
know
what's
wrong
with
her.
What?
You
know,
how
Needy
has
been
Well,
it's
not
just
because
he
was
like...
..brutally
murdered
and
stuff.
I
don't
wanna
say
this.
Needy
and
Collin
were
intimate.
And
by
that...
..I
mean
they
were
poking
on
a
No...
She
and
Collin
were
doing
things
that
Okay,
total
varsity
moves.
I
just
can't
believe
that
she
would
mess
I
care
about
you
so
much,
Chip.
More
than
I've
ever
had
the
guts
to
admit.
These
fine,
young
gentlemen,
..have
been
generous
enough
to
..from
their
sold-out
national
tour.
To
play
our
dance.
For
free.
Needy
didn't
deserve
a
boy
like
you.
Boys
and
girls,
..please
welcome...
..L-o-o-o-w
Shoulder!
"Through
The
Trees"
All
alone
in
an
empty
room,
Nothing
left
but
the
memories
of
when...
..I
had
my
best
friend.
Oh,
you're
so
salty!
Yeah!
You're...
..salty
too.
Say
it
like
you
mean
it.
Say
I'm
better
than
Needy.
Take
my
breath
as
your
own.
Take
my
eyes
to
guide
you
home.
Because
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here...
Chip!
Because
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
And
I'm
still
here
so...
Because
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
I'm
still
here
breathing
now.
And
I'm
still
here...
Because
you're
not
coming
back.
What
are
you
doing?
Come
on,
Chip.
Show
me
your
breast
stroke.
I
feel
so
empty.
Yeah,
me
too.
Please
just
come
here
and
kiss
me
again.
I
can't.
I'm
sorry.
This
just
feels
weird.
Help!
Needy.
Needy.
She
can
fly?
She's
just
hovering.
It's
not
that
impressive.
God,
do
you
have
to
undermine
You're
such
a
player-hater.
You're
a
jerk.
Wow!
Nice
insult,
Hannah
Montana!
You
got
any
more
harsh
digs?
You
know
what?
You
were
never
a
good
friend.
Even
when
we
were
little.
..pour
lemonade
on
my
bed.
See,
atleast
I'm
consistent.
Why
do
you
need
him?
Huh?
You
could
have
anybody,
So..why
Chip?
Is
it
just
to
piss
me
off?
Or
is
it
because
you're
just
really
insecure?
I'm
not
insecure,
Needy.
God,
that's
a
joke!
How
can
I
ever
be
insecure?
Yeah...
..two
years
ago.
I'm
still
socially
relevant.
And
when
you
didn't
need
laxatives
I'm
going...
..to
eat
your
soul...
..and
shit
it
out,
Lesnicki.
I
thought
you
only
murdered
boys.
I
go
both
ways.
Do
you
have
a
tampon?
Thought
I'd
ask.
You
seemed
like
you
might
be
plugging.
Oh,
Chip!
Needy.
I
should
have
believed
you.
I'm
sorry.
No,
no!
Listen
to
me!
Listen
to
me!
Okay?
It's
not
working.
Come
on.
Needy.
Needy.
I'm
going
somewhere.
No!
No,
no,
no.
Yes,
I'm!
I
think
I
already
died
before
you
got
here,
..but
I
woke
up
when
I
heard
your
voice.
I
love
you.
I
love
you
too.
And
you
look
totally
hot
in
that
dress.
Oh,
God!
No,
I'm
not.
Chip?
No!
No-o-o!
No...!
Best
friends
forever,
huh?
You
killed
my
fucking
boyfriend!
You
goddamned
monster!
You
know
what
this
is
for?
It's
for
cutting
boxes.
Do
you
buy
all
your

murder
weapons
God,
you're
butch.
Cross
out
Jennifer!
My
tit!
No...
..your
heart.
Oh,
Jennifer!
Needy?
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
I
don't
know
who
Needy
Lesnicki
I'm
a
different
person
now.
A
person
who
uses
curse
words...
..and
kicks
orderlies
and
sees
things
A
very
bad,
very
damaged
person.
But
sometimes,
change
can
be
good.
For
instance,
most
occult
scholars
..but
if
you're
bitten
by
a
demon...
..and
you
live...
..you
just
might
absorb
some
of
You
just
might
get
lucky
for
once
Where
you
looking
to
go,
young
lady?
Hop
in
my
chariot.
So
why
you
headed
East?
I'm
following
this
rock
band.
Must
be
one
in
hell
of
a
group.
Tonight's
gonna
be
their
last
show.
"Violet"
And
the
sky
was
made
of
amethyst.
And
all
the
stars
look
just
like
little
fish.
You
should
learn
when
to
go.
You
should
learn
how
to
say
no.
Might
last
a
day,
yeah-h-h!
Mine
is
forever.
Might
last
a
day,
yeah-h-h!
Well,
mine
is
forever.
When
they
get
what
they
want,
When
they
get
what
they
want,
Go
on,
take
everything,
Go
on,
take
everything,
Hey,
look
at
this
motherfucker.
Go
open
the
door.
"In
the
Flesh"
Darling,
darling,
darling,
I
can't
wait
to
see
you.
Your
picture
ain't
enough.
I
can't
wait
to
touch
you
in
the
flesh.
Darling,
darling,
darling,
I
can't
wait
to
hear
you.
Remembering
your
love.
Is
nothing
without
you
in
the
flesh.
In
the
flesh!
In
the
flesh!
