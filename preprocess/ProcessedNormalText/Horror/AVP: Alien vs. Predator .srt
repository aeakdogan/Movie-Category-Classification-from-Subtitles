Hey.
Hey,
hey.
Come
here.
Take
a
look
at
this.
What?
-
What
is
it?
-
Where
is
she?
There
isn't
anything
in
sector
14.
There
is
now.
-
Hello?
-
Who
is
this?
I
represent
Weyland
Industries.
-
Let
me
guess.
He's
suing
us
again?
Mr
Weyland
has
offered
to
fund
your
When?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow's
gonna
be
a
problem.
Yes,
I
told
Mr
Weyland
that.
He
said
he
didn't
have
a
week.
We
must
be
right
on
top
of
it.
What
is
it,
Sebastian?
The
burial
chamber
is
here.
I
know
it
too,
but
without
a
crew
Hold
the
team
together
for
two
days.
I'll
get
us
more
money.
I
might
be
able
to
help
you
Do
I
know
you?
In
exchange
for
a
little
of
your
time.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
There's
your
magazine.
Excuse
me.
That's
OK.
I'm
documenting
the
trip
for
my
boys.
Jacob
and
Scotty.
Would
you
mind
taking
a
picture?
Just
wanna
show
them
-
Smile.
-
There
you
go.
I'm
Graeme
Miller.
I'm
a
chemical
engineer.
Alexa
Woods,
-
Do
you
work
for
Weyland?
No,
I
split
my
time
between
working
and
taking
scientists
Lex.
Buckle
up.
Thanks,
Jack.
-
Is
he
a
friend
of
yours?
He
trained
most
of
the
pilots
here.
-
Just
passed
the
PSR.
-
Of
what?
I
wish
he'd
called
it
out
before
we
passed
it.
The
PSR
is
the
point
of
safe
return.
It
means
we've
used
up
half
our
fuel,
Right,
but
if
something
went
wrong,
-
We
could
ditch.
But
the
temperature
of
the
water
Welcome
aboard,
everybody.
Please.
Some
of
you
may
be
wondering
Your
host
will
give
you
the
answer
now.
Mr
Weyland.
Seven
days
ago,
one
of
my
satellites
discovered
a
sudden
heat
bloom
The
red
lines
indicate
solid
walls.
Through
thermal
mapping,
we've
generated
It's
massive,
containing
hundreds
of
rooms,
My
experts
tell
me
it's
a
pyramid.
What
they
can't
agree
on
One
expert
tells
me
this
has
features
Another
tells
me
it's
probably
Cambodian.
What
they
all
agree
on
is
that
-
I
think
your
experts
are
right.
-
All
of
them.
This
pyramid
contains
This
might
be
the
first
pyramid
ever
built.
-
But
built
by
whom?
Thank
you.
But
how
could
anyone
possibly
Ancient
maps
show
Antarctica
free
of
ice.
-
It's
likely
the
continent
was
once
habitable.
But
if
I
could
take
a
sample
from
it,
Dr
Miller,
I'm
offering
-
What
caused
the
heat
bloom?
-
Where
exactly
on
the
ice
is
this?
But
it's
not
on
the
ice.
It's
2,000ft
below
it.
-
Mr
Quinn?
You're
looking
at
the
best
drilling
team
in
the
Add
three
weeks
on
top
of
that
We
don't
have
that
kind
of
time,
Ms
Woods.
I'm
not
the
only
one
Others
will
be
here
soon.
Maybe
I
wasn't
clear.
That's
why
I
asked
you
here.
Bouvetoya
is
one
of
the
world's
most
isolated
-
There's
no
help
if
we
run
into
trouble.
But
the
train
has
left
the
station.
And
I
think
I
speak
This
is
worth
the
risk.
Find
another
guide.
I've
spoken
with
Mr
Weyland.
Chopper's
refuelling
to
fly
you
home.
Who'd
you
get?
Gerald
Murdoch.
-
Come
in.
He's
not
ready.
-
Don't
worry
about
it.
-
We
called
him.
"Bullshit"?
What
I
told
you
in
there
wasn't
bullshit.
If
you
I
don't
understand.
We
need
you
to
take
us
from
the
ship
-
What
about
inside
the
pyramid?
Once
we're
on
the
site,
we
have
the
best
-
Is
this
new?
Mr
Weyland,
when
I
lead
my
team
I
admire
your
passion.
I
wish
you
were
going
with
us.
You're
making
a
mistake.
It's
in
the
upper
atmosphere.
Streams
of
protons
being
deflected
by
the
earth's
magnetic
Shackleton
called
Antarctica
It's
the
one
place
left
in
the
world
It's
completely
free.
Me,
I'm
sort
of
partial
to
the
penguins.
I
wish
you'd
reconsider
coming
with
us,
Lex.
Come
on,
don't
make
me
pull
out
Your
kids
aren't
that
cute.
What
if
we
got
pictures
Want
my
advice?
Stay
on
the
boat.
OK.
Let
me
ask
you
something.
Do
we
stand
a
better
chance
or
with
the
number-two
choice?
Miss
Woods,
your
helicopter's
refuelled.
They're
waiting
for
you.
Everybody,
listen
up!
Gather
round.
Told
you
she'd
stay.
Laugh
it
up,
Miller.
Laugh
it
up.
Gentlemen?
It
is
my
job
to
keep
you
alive
and
I
need
your
help
to
do
that.
Since
I
don't
have
time
to
properly
train
you,
One.
No
one
goes
anywhere
alone,
ever.
Two.
Everyone
must
maintain
Three.
Unexpected
things
are
gonna
happen.
When
they
do,
no
one
tries
to
be
a
hero.
Understood?
Understood?
-
Yes,
ma'am.
Seven
seasons
on
the
ice
-
I
don't
plan
on
using
it.
Same
principle
as
a
condom.
I'd
rather
have
one
and
not
need
it
I'm
glad
that
you
decided
to
stay.
Move
the
trucks
out
on
the
ice.
Move
that.
OK,
let's
move.
-
What's
with
the
bottle
cap?
What's
with
the
bottle
cap?
This
is
a
valuable
archaeological
find.
When
I
was
a
kid
growing
up
in
Italy,
La
luna
del
cacciatore.
Brava.
-
What's
that?
Hunter's
moon.
Hold
it,
guys.
-
Keep
those
engines
running!
Move
over
a
little
further.
Connors.
It's
an
abandoned
whaling
station.
According
to
your
satellite
imagery,
All
right,
bring
it
up.
Come
on.
Spread
out.
We'll
use
this
place
as
a
base
camp.
Mr
Quinn,
I'm
on
it.
OK,
guys,
let's
move
out.
-
What
are
these?
This
station
was
abandoned
in
1904.
It
was
a
big
mystery
back
then.
One
for
National
Geographic.
-
Lex.
There's
something
there.
Listen.
Listen.
Careful.
They
bite.
Over
here.
Over
here.
What
is
it?
Can
you
believe
that?
It's
drilled
at
a
perfect
30-degree
angle.
-
How
far
does
it
go
down?
There
it
is.
Clear
as
day.
-
Nothing.
-
Thermal
equipment
of
some
kind.
More
advanced.
Incredibly
powerful.
I've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
There's
no
team
and
no
machine
in
the
world
Well,
the
only
way
we're
gonna
know
for
sure
Look
at
that.
Change
it.
Now!
OK,
guys,
what's
taking
so
long?
There's
no
room
for
sick
men
-
My
doctors
tell
me
the
worst
is
behind
me.
Stay
on
the
ship.
When
you
get
sick,
you
think
about
your
life
You
know
what
will
happen
when
I
go?
Maybe
12.
That's
it.
I've
heard
this
speech
before.
My
dad
broke
his
leg
He
was
like
you.
We
reached
the
top,
I
had
my
first
drink
with
my
dad
at
14,400ft.
On
the
way
down,
he
developed
a
blood
clot
He
suffered
for
four
hours
You
think
that's
the
last
thing
Or
drinking
champagne
I
need
this.
Come
on,
move.
Shit.
Mr
Weyland!
Man
down!
Get
him!
Somebody
get
him!
Move
it!
Now!
I
don't
understand
it.
Well,
that
tunnel
didn't
dig
itself.
Move
it.
Connors,
get
those
lights
up.
We
have
power.
Congratulations,
Mr
Weyland.
Looks
like
you'll
be
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
all
for
this.
Let's
make
history.
Thomas.
What
is
it?
-
I
recognise
the
Egyptian...
Pre-conquest
era.
The
third
is
Cambodian.
Then
you
were
right.
-
That's
what
it
looks
like.
"Those
who
choose
may
enter."
Who
taught
you
to
translate?
Funny.
Kinda
looked
like
you.
Well,
it's
not
"choose".
It's
"chosen".
"Only
the
chosen
ones
may
enter."
Quinn,
is
that
you
out
there?
Mikkel.
What
is
all
this?
This
is
the
sacrificial
chamber.
Like
the
Aztecs
and
the
Egyptians.
Whoever
built
this
pyramid
This
is
where
the
chosen
ones
Those
that
were
chosen
would
lie
here.
They
weren't
bound
or
tied
in
any
way.
They
went
to
die
willingly.
Men
and
women.
It
was
considered
an
honour.
Lucky
them.
"They
gave
their
lives
What
happened
here?
It's
common
in
ritual
sacrifice
That's
nice.
But
that's
not
where
your
heart
is.
Besides,
it
looks
like
the
bones
Something
broke
out
of
this
body.
-
What
have
you
found,
Max?
Looks
like
there's
another
room
down
there.
-
Let's
move
to
that
lower
room.
Ms
Woods.
You,
stay
here.
Rousseau,
you
stay
with
him.
Catalogue
everything.
Professor.
This
should
be
directly
below
Sebastian.
It's
a
sarcophagus.
This
is
the
Long
Count.
This
is
the
Aztec
calendar.
And
this,
it's
some
kind
of
combination
lock.
"Days."
"Months."
"Years."
The
dials
are
set
for...
1904.
Someone
opened
this
100
years
ago?
-
What's
today's
date?
10/10/2004.
-
Are
you
sure
this
is
gonna
work?
Back
up!
Oh,
my
God.
Take
a
look
at
this.
-
Any
idea
what
these
are?
-
You?
-
It's
a
good
thing
we
brought
the
experts.
Cos
this
is
like
finding
Weyland?
A
little
too
much
excitement.
We've
been
out
long
enough
for
today.
We'll
set
up
base
camp
at
the
whaling
station
Well,
you
can
go
back
to
the
base
camp,
No.
You
wanted
to
leave
You
wanted
to
be
the
first
here.
We
are.
Now,
we
move
as
a
team,
You
heard
her.
-
What
do
you
wanna
do
with
these?
We'll
run
further
tests
on
the
surface.
No.
No!
Don't
touch
them.
-
Watch
out!
The
door!
-
You
OK?
Slab's
gotta
weigh
two
tons.
What
did
you
say
this
room
was
called?
Sacrificial
chamber.
-
Rousseau.
-
Come
in,
Rousseau.
-
Is
there
anything
you
didn't
tell
me?
Whatever
it
is,
we're
not
prepared.
We're
gonna
round
up
the
rest
of
the
team
-
What
are
you
doing?
My
job
is
over
when
everyone
And
that
gun
doesn't
change
anything.
This
bearing
should
take
us
back
to
the
What
about
Thomas?
Rousseau?
-
We'll
find
them
on
the
way
up.
Stone,
Verheiden.
Cover
our
backs.
The
heat
bloom
your
satellite
detected
What
do
you
mean?
A
building
this
sophisticated
I
think
that's
what
your
satellite
detected.
-
Preparing.
Gentlemen?
Keep
close.
-
Recognise
what's
on
their
shoulders?
-
We
worshipped
these
things?
And
the
artefacts
you
removed
from
Let's
keep
moving.
Take
cover.
Where's
Stone?
Stone!
The
pyramid's
shifting
again.
The
doors
are
closing.
Get
out.
Come
on.
OK.
Let's
go.
Let's
go.
Let's
go.
Hey!
Verheiden!
Verheiden!
Verheiden!
Somebody!
Run!
Let's
go!
No!
Quickly!
No!
No!
Hey!
Can
you
hear
me?
It's
Connors!
Where
are
you?
We're
never
getting
out
of
this
place.
Have
you
got
any
children?
-
Got
a
son.
That
means
that
we
do
not
have
We're
gonna
make
it
outta
here.
We're
surviving
this
There's
no
way
out
back
there.
-
What's
that?
The
Aztec
calendar
was
metric.
I'm
guessing
the
pyramid
Let's
stick
together.
Weyland.
It
would
seem
that
we
are
rats
in
a
maze.
Sorry.
Connors?
Connors!
Verheiden?
Verheiden?
-
Oh,
God.
It's
OK.
I'm
gonna
find
a
way
Verheiden!
No!
You
want
a
piece
of
me?
Oh,
God.
Weyland.
-
You
OK?
Leave
it.
They
can
only
slow
us
down.
Too
much
has
been
lost
Give
it
to
me.
Max.
Hold
on.
Look
out!
Come
on.
We
have
to
get
Weyland.
Weyland,
come
on.
-
What
were
they?
I've
got
to
stop.
I've
got
to
stop.
Take
it
easy.
Weyland.
Look
at
me.
You
have
to
slow
your
breathing
down.
Slow,
steady
breaths.
-
Weyland,
come
on.
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
die
down
here.
You
didn't.
-
There's
another
one.
We
have
to
go.
Now!
-
Come
with
us.
-
Now!
Run!
Don't
turn
your
back
on
me.
Wait.
This
way.
Go!
Go!
Look
over
here.
-
He's
marking
himself.
Ancient
warriors
would
mark
themselves
It's
a
rite
of
passage.
This
is
starting
to
make
sense.
The
hieroglyphs
are
But
the
story
is
all
here.
Thousands
of
years
ago,
They
taught
humans
how
to
build
Every
hundred
years
the
gods
would
return.
And
when
they
did,
Humans
were
used
to
breed
the
ultimate
prey.
The
hunters
would
battle
to
prove
themselves
worthy
But
if
the
hunters
lost,
they
made
sure
nothing
survived.
An
entire
civilisation
wiped
out
overnight.
So...
the
humanoids,
the
hunters
-
And
they
use
us
like
cattle.
We're
hosts
for
them
to
breed
in.
The
heat
bloom
was
the
sign
This
whole
thing
was
a
trap.
Without
us,
there
could
be
no
hunt.
Shit!
Verheiden!
Oh,
shit.
When
that
door
opens,
we're
dead.
-
Not
if
we
set
things
right.
This
pyramid
is
like
a
prison.
We
took
the
guards'
guns,
To
restore
order,
the
guards
need
their
guns.
When
that
door
opens,
Are
you
crazy?
During
a
big-game
hunt,
the
They're
not
hunting
us.
-
It's
time
to
pick
a
side.
We
have
to
consider
the
possibility
But
we
have
to
make
sure
Because
if
they
do,
everything
everywhere
could
die.
The
enemy
of
my
enemy...
is
my
friend.
Let's
go
find
our
friend.
How
do
you
say
"scared
shitless"
in
Italian?
Non
vedo
I'ora
di
uscire
con
te
da
questa
More
or
less.
Move!
Lex.
Lex.
Hold
on.
Come
on,
Lex.
Oh,
no.
Wait.
Wait.
Please,
wait.
The
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend.
The
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend.
I'm
coming
with
you.
What
are
you
doing?
Miller!
Miller!
Sebastian.
-
Help
me,
Lex.
-
It's
too
late.
It's
inside
me.
-
You
can't...
No.
No.
No!
No!
I
have
to
help
him.
Lex!
They
mustn't
reach
the
surface.
They
mustn't
reach
the
surface.
I
know.
Do
it!
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
It's
a
bomb.
Well,
I
hope
it
kills
every
fucking
one
of
'em.
You
are
one
ugly
mother...
Got
it!
