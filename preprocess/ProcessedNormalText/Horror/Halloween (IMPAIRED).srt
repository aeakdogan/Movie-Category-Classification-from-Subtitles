But
what
Samuels
is
really
talking
You
see,
fate
caught
up
No
matter
what
course
of
action
...he
was
destined
to
his
own
fate...
...his
own
day
of
reckoning
with
himself.
The
idea
is
that
destiny...
...is
a
very
real,
concrete
thing...
...that
every
person
has
to
deal
with.
How
does
Samuels'
view
of
fate
Laurie?
-
Ma'am?
Oh,
um,
Costaine
wrote
that
fate
...whereas
Samuels
felt
that,
well,
...like

fire
and

personified
fate.

writing,
It

Waiting

distract
Lindsey,
...to
the
first
bedroom
on
the
left.

No,
don't
rip
my
blouse.
Then
you
rip
my
clothes
off.
Yeah,
I
think
I
got
it.
Totally.


LYNDA:

Bob,
put
me
down.
Put
me

This
is
totally
silly.
Put

down.
Hey,
it's
totally

Yeah.
Hey,
Annie.
Annie,

I
wonder
where

went.
Oh,
Annie
probably
took
Lindsey
out

Hey,
let's
look
for
a
note.
Let's
don't.


KIDS:
He's
gonna
get
you.
No,
he's
not.
Hey,
nobody's
getting
anybody.
Everybody's
having
a
good
time
tonight.
All
right,
you
guys,
what's
next?
Let's
make
more

No,
we've

LAURIE:
Doyle
house.
Hi,
Laurie.
What's
up?
Uh,
I'm
just
sitting
down

Hey,
is
Annie
around?
No.
I
thought
she'd
be
home
by
now.
Well,
she's
totally
not
here.
She
probably
stopped
off
someplace.
I
have
Lindsey
here
and
I
wanna
know
Okay.
Later.
Have
a
good
time.
We
definitely
will.
Bye.
Lindsey
is
gone
for
the
night.
Hey,
now
that's
wonderful.




Oh,
shit.
Not
again.
I
can't
help
it.
The
phone
keeps
ringing.
-
Oh,
and
I
can't
keep
you
interested?
Well,
I
can't.
What
if
it's
the
Wallaces?
We'd
get
Annie
in
trouble,
you
know.
We'll
just
take
it
off
the
hook.

Oh,
fantastic.

Totally.
Yeah.
-
Want
a
beer?
Is
that
all
you
can
say?
Yeah.
Go
get
me
a
beer.
I
thought
you
were
gonna
get
me
one.
Yeah?

I'll
be
right
back.
Don't
get
dressed.



Annie?
Paul?
Lynda,
you
asshole.
Okay,
Lynda.
Come
on
out.

Well,
did
you
get
my
beer?

Cute,
Bob.
Real
cute.
See
anything
you
like?
What's
the
matter?

All
right,
all
right.
Well,
can't
you
answer
me?
Okay,
don't
answer
me.
Boy,
are
you
weird.
Well,
I'm
gonna
call
Laurie.
This
is
going
nowhere.

Finally.
Hello?

Hello?

All
right,
Annie.
First,
I
get
your
famous
chewing,
Annie,
are
you
all
right?


Are
you
fooling
around
again?
I'll
kill
you
if
this
is
a
joke.
LAURIE
:
Annie?


Sleep
tight,
kids.



Bob?
Lynda?
Annie?
Lynda?
Bob?
All
right,
Annie.

All

meatheads.
Joke's

Come

Get

Lindsey,
-
I'm
scared.
-
The
bogeyman--

Oh,
no.

Please
stop.
Please.

Where
were
you?
I
found
the
car.
He's
here.
-
Where?
You
go
around
the
back
of
the
houses.
-
Go
on.
Tommy?
Lindsey?
Babies.
We're
gonna
take
a
little
walk.
Was
it
the
bogeyman?
I'm
scared.
There's
nothing
to
be
scared
of.
Are
you
sure?
TOMMY:
I
killed
him.
You
can't
kill
the
bogeyman.

LAURIE:
Now
lock
the
door.







Tommy,
unlock
the
door.
Come
here.
Now,
just
listen
to
me.
I
want
you
to
go
down
the
stairs
I
want
you
to
go
down
the
street
I
want
you
to
tell
them
to
call
the
police
-
Laurie...
Go,
do
as
I
say.

Come
on!
Get
help!
Come
on.
Come
on!





It
was
the
bogeyman.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was.
