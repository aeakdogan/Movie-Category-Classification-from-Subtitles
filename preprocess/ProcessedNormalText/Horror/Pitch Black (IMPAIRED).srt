the

No
wonder
I'm
still
awake.

Heard
an

some

probably
on

But
what
route?
What
route?
Smelled

here's
my

A
long
time

A
long
time




Why
did
I
fall
on
you?
He's
dead.
The
captain's
dead.
I
was
looking
right
at
him.
The
chrono
shows
so...
so
gravity
was
not
Why'd
I
fall
at
all?
Did
you
hear
The
captain's
dead.

Shit!
We're
hemorrhaging

Come

Just

me
Just

Look,
I

Better
try

I'm

What
the

is




Yeah,
I-Imam?


Somebody's
gonna
get
hurt
It
ain't
gonna
be
me.

Here,
Shazza.
So
I
guess
I'm
sorry.
Get
it
out
of
me!

Don't
touch
it!
Don't...
Don't
you
Get
it
out
of
him!
No,
no,
no,
There's
some
Anestaphine

Not
anymore,
Get
out
of
here,
everyone.

Get
out
of
here.
Allahu
Akbar
Allahu
Akbar...

That'll
teach
me
Interesting.

Yeah,
I
feel
one
lung
short.
All
of
us.
I
feel
like
I
just
There
was
talk
of
but
then
we
saw
this.
What
the
bloody
hell

Might
have
been
a
rogue
comet.
I
don't
know.
Well,
I,
for
one,
This
beast
wasn't
but
I
think
Actually,
the
only
Yes,
I
suppose
Thanks
very
much.

No,
really.
Well
done.
He
just
escaped
So
do
we
just
keep
him
Well,
that

Only
around
humans.

It's
all
topsy-turvy.

Well,
thank
God
Booze?
This
is
what
I'm
gonna
need
This
is
Mmm-hmm.
I
don't
suppose
Unfortunately
it
especially
You
do
realize
All
deserts
It
only
waits
I
hope
you're
right.
All
the
more
for
me
then.


Motherfucker.
What
the
hell
Maratha

picks
Very
rare.
And
this?
That's
a
hunting
from
northern
That's
very,
very
rare
They
couldn't
hunt
shit
would
be
my
guess.
What's
the
point
anyway?
If
the
man
is
gone,
Why
should
he
bother
us?
Maybe
to
take
Maybe
to
work
your
nerves.
Or
maybe
to
just
come
back
and
skull-fuck
you
He
sounds
like
a
charmer.
For
you.
Let's
just
get...
Yeah?
Imam,
if
we're
before
nightfall,
Ali.
Excuse
me.
I
think
3
suns?
Bloody
hell.
So
much
for
your
nightfall.
So
much
We
take
this
A
path,
Blue
sun,
blue
water.
Ever
wondered
It's
a
bit
of
a
bad
sign.
I
thought
you
found
towards
sunset.
Right.
Which
means
Zeke.
Fully
loaded

One

Don't
tell
me
What
happens
if

There'll
be
no
shots.

Allahu
Akbar...

Shh,
shh,
shh.


7
stones
You're
on
a
trip
Once
in
every
lifetime,
A
great
pilgrimage.
To
get
to
know
Allah
better?
Yes,
but
to
know
yourself,
Yeah.
We
are
all
on


Sorry.
So
did
you
No

well,
I'll
hold

could

you'd
never

that's
how
good
Tell
me
something,
or
did
they
run
away


perhaps
like

He
asks
what
could
have
Is

Probably
shouldn't
do
this.
It

you
You're
probably
right.
Mmm.
You
know,
you
could
have
If
we
don't
find
water,
I
wanted
to
get
away.
I've
never
seen
a

I
think
we

What
did
Owens
mean
about
not
touching
It's
just
between
you
and
me,
I'm
not

when
things
were

There
was
water
here.
Lights?
Lights
on?
Ok.

They
are
saying
Allahu
Akbar.
Yes.
This
is
the
source
No
darkness.
No
lights

Hello,
Mecca!

Tell
me
that
was
you
What
are
you
He's
been
right
here
Back
of
the
ship.
You
trying
to
tell
me

No!

Oh,
my
God.
who
got
out


It
was
just
somebody
else.
Crikey.
I
thought
I
thought
it
was
Riddick.
No
juice.
It
looks
like
We
might
be
able
Shut
up.
Sorry.
I
thought
Like
what?
Gunshots.





Zeke!


Piece
of
shit!


Just
somebody
So
where's
the
body?
Well,
do
you
want
to
tell
me
Look,
you
told
Johns
That's
fine.
You
don't
want
to
talk
to
me,
but
just
so
you
know...
there's
a
debate
right
now
we
should
leave
You
mean
What
whispers?
The
ones
telling
me
just
to
the
left
4th
lumbar
down,
the
abdominal
aorta.
It's
a
metallic
taste,
Copperish.
If
you
cut
it
Do
you
want
to
shock
me
All
you
people
Most
days,
I'd
take
that
But
it
ain't
me
Show
me
your
eyes,
Riddick.
You'd
have
to
come
Closer.
Where
the
hell
You
gotta
kill
a
few
people.
Ok,
I
can
do
it.
Then
you
gotta
where
they
tell
you
You
dig
up
a
doctor
and
you
pay
him
to
do
a
surgical
shine
job
So
you
can
see
Exactly.
Leave.
Cute
kid.
Did
I
kill
Sure.
Did
I
kill
Zeke?
No.
You
got
the
wrong
killer.
He's
not
in
the
hole.
Look
deeper.

I
think
he
went
off
Now
he's
got
you
believing
Well,
let's
just
be
sure.
Look,
murders
aside,
Riddick
belongs
He
loves
to
jaw-jack
because
that's
all
he
has.
Why
try
to
You're
a
cop.
For
God's
sake,
Hey!
I'll
go.
Look,
no
one
is
going.
Look,
being
ballsy
doesn't
change
What,
do
you
think
Well,
are
you?
They're
hollow.




I'm
in
here.
I'm
inside!
I
thought
Please,
can
you
hear
me?

Help
me.
Give
me
your
goddamn
hand.
I
heard
you,
Fry.
Come
on.
Fry,
are
you
ok?
What's
down
there?
Did
you
find
Zeke?

Fry,
are
you
ok?
Ok.
Fuck!
That
was
so
fucking
stupid.
I
don't
know
but
whatever
it
is,

Get
it
off
me!
Get
it
off
me!
Watch
it.
Watch
your
head.
Finally
found
something
So
here's
the
deal.
You
work
without
chains,
You
do
what
I
say,
For
what?
The
honor
of
going
back
The
truth
is
I'm
tired
of
chasing
you.
Are
you
saying
I'm
thinking
you
My
recommendation:
Do
me.
Don't
take
the
chance
that
I'll
get
shiv-happy
Ok.
Ghost
me,
mother-fucker.
I
want
you
The
way
it
could
have
gone
Here.
Take
it
easy.
Fuck
you!
Do
we
have
a
deal?
I
want
you
Just
one?
For
now.
So,
click
your
fingers,
I
didn't
say
that,
but
at
least
this
way,
falling
asleep
So,
can
I
talk

Blast.
Paris
P.
Ogilvie.
Antiquities
dealer,
Richard
B.
Riddick.
Escaped
convict,
That's...
That's
It's...
It's
It's...
It's
By
all
means,
I
mean,
normally
I
can
But
this,
It'll
work.
It's
nothing
so
long
as
Well,
it's
not

Take
a
2-seater
to
the
Sol-Track
Stick
out
her
thumb,
Ain't
that
right,
captain?
Can
I
have
I
got
it.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Do
me
a
favor.
Check
these
containers
out
see
what
we
can
patch
All
right?


Mine!
Insha
Allah!
All
right,
all
right.
Are
you
all
right?

Ok.


And
we
are
getting
there.
So
we've
got
enough
power
but
we'll
still
How
many
are
we
Um.
Let's
see,
The
other
ship
That
would
be
5.
5
total
to
launch.
35
kilos
each,
huh?
Well,
that's
Well,
you
know
that
old
Mmm-hmm.
I
might
be
able
Yeah.
Do
it
if
you
can,
Where
did
Riddick
go?
Let's
go.


You're
missing
the
party.
Come
on,
boy.

You're
missing
the
party.
Oh,
man.


All
praises
be
Allah,
What?
It's
the
winner

Who
were
these
people
anyway,
I
don't
know.
You
know,
an
advance
team,
Nice
of
them
Why'd
they
leave
their
ship?

It's
not
a
ship,
And
it's
disposable,
really.
It's
more
like
an
emergency
Yeah,
they
probably
had
These
people
didn't
leave.
Whoever
got
Zeke
They're
all
dead.
You
don't
really
think
with
their
clothes
photos
on
the
shelves.
Maybe
they
had
weight
limits.
I
know
you
don't
prep
unless
there's
He's
fucking
right.
Watch
your
mouth.
He's
just
saying
So
what
happened?
Has
anyone
seen
Has
anyone
checked


Ali.
Come
on.




Ali.
Jack,
wait.
Wait!

Ali.
Ali.

Ali?



Imam?


so
they
ran
here.
Heaviest
doors.
Thought
they'd
but
they
forgot
Here.
What,
it's
broken?
No.
There's
still
Actually,
you
asshole,
Ok,
let's
board
this
place
up
Whatever
the
fuck
they
seem
to
stick
So,
if
we
stick
to
daylight,
Let's
go.
22
years
ago.
What?
These
coring
samples
Last
one's
22
years
ago
Is
there
something
special
I
don't
know.
There
could
be.
An
eclipse.
You're
not
afraid
So
we
gotta
get
I've
still
gotta
Wait
on
the
power
cells.
What?
Wait
for
what?
We
don't
know
Just
get
the
fucking
cells
What...
What
Maybe
I
should
tell
you


made
a
hell
of
a
good
run
Ok,
ok,
Maybe
we
can
use
him
He
also
figured
out
Look,
you
told
me
You
said
that
Now,
you
may
have
noticed
Now
the
only
way
is
if
he
believes
Let's
just
say
You
mean
if
he
realizes
I
want
you
to
listen
If
we
bring
the
cells
up
when
the
wings
are
ready
He
hasn't
harmed
any
of
us.
Let's
just
stick
to
the
deal.
He's
a
killer.
The
law
says
There's
nothing
You
hear
me?
You're
dancing
I'm
not
gonna
or
slash
Not
on
my
watch.


Shaking
like
that
I
thought
This?
This
is
just
a
personal
Thanking
you.
Looks
like
we're
a
few
shy.
Power
cells.
They're
coming.
It's
strange,
Unless...
Unless
he
told
you
the
particulars
I
got
the
quick
Now
you're
worried
It
has
entered
I
asked
what
you
thought.
You
scare
me,
Riddick.
That's
what
Now
can
I
just
I've
been
meaning
unrestrained.
Do
you
think...
You
think
Johns
is
a
do-right
man?
Why?
What
did
you
hear?
Well,
guess
if
it
were
trickeration,
He'd
kill
me.
Then
again,
I
am
worth
Oh,
you
didn't
know
that?
Your
Johns
ain't
a
cop.
He's
got
that
and
that
blue
uniform,
but
he's
just
a
merc.
And
I'm
just
a
payday.
That's
why
The
creed
is
greed.
Don't
waste
my
time.
We're
not
gonna

I
don't
know
truly
when
the
lights
But
I
do
know
this
little
is
gonna
Ever
wonder
why
Ask
him.
Ask
why
your
crew
pal
So
who
are
you,
You're
not
a
cop,
I
never
said
I
was
a
cop.
No,
you
didn't.
And
you
never
said
You
have
caffeine
I
have
a
little
morphine.
You
got
2
mornings
every
day.
It's
not
a
problem
unless...
No,
it
becomes
a
problem
when
you
let
We
have
enough
drugs
here
Owens
was
already
dead.
His
brain
just
hadn't
caught
Is
there
anything
else
You
know,
I...
I'm
letting
you
It
is
not
unreasonable...
Do
you
feel
that?
That's
my
first
He
went
for
the
sweet
spot
They
had
to
leave
a
piece
and
I
can
feel
it
So
maybe
the
care
and
feeding
It's
just
that
you
could've
Yeah,
well,
look
to
thine


I'm
not
What
are
If
we
need
anything
That
sand
cat's
solar.
Where's
Riddick?
Leave
him.
Thought
Johns!

Hey!
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
just
gonna
You
wouldn't
leave


Shit.


How
many
are
there?
Beautiful.
Allah.
People,
Perhaps
you
should
flee!
Let's
go!
Come
on,
run!
Shit!
Come
on!


Get
down!

No.
Stay
there!
Stay
down,
Shazza!
Come
back
here!

Shazza,
stay
down!

Please,
I
really
think
We
have
to
be
inside
Come
on,
let's
go!


What
is
it,
Riddick?
Like
I
said,
it
ain't
me

If
she
only
would
have
She
wouldn't
have
died.

These
just
might
that
killed
every


There's
a
cutting
torch
I
just
can't
find
it.


Why
do
they
do
that,
Perhaps
it's
the
way
with
sound

Could
be
a
breach
in
the
hull.
Come
on,
Johns.

Why
don't
you

Where
you
going?

Paris!

You
don't
know
I
know
what's
in
here.


Hurry!





Extremely
bad
timing.
Just
don't
run.
Riddick?
Don't
stop
burning.
Take
this.
Take
that.
Ok.
Hassan.




Is
it
alive?

It's
like
It
hurts
them.
Light
actually


Hassan.
We'll
burn
Come
on,

we
got
2
hand
lights.
There's
gotta
be
something

Anything
over
45
proof
How
many
bottles
I
don't
know.
Maybe
10.
Ok,
Johns,
So,
maybe
we've
got
Enough
for
We
stick
to
the
plan.
We
get
the
4
cells
back
we're
off
this
rock.
Look,
I
hate
to
ruin
but
that
sand
cat
is
solar.
So
we
carry
the
cells.
We
drag
them,
You
mean
tonight,
with
all
All
right,
A
few
hours?
A
day,
tops?
I
have
the
impression
The
2
planets
and
there
would
be
Mmm.
These
suns
gotta
And
if
these
creatures
and
we
let
the
sun
come
up.
I'm
sure
somebody
else
locked
inside
We
need
to
think
How
scared
will
Don't
use
him
like
that.
Like
what?
You
deal
with
your
own
fear.
Why
don't
you
shut
and
let
me
come
up
that
doesn't
involve

I'm
waiting.
How
much
you
weigh,
Johns?
What's
it
matter,
Carolyn?
How
much?
Around
79
kilos.
'Cause
you're
79
kilos
That's
why
Is
that
fucking
right?
Where
are
you
going?
This
solves
nothing.
Ok.
They're
afraid
That
means
we
don't
have
And
you
are
sure
even
in
the
dark?
No,
I
can't.
But
he
can.

Ok,
wait.
Wait!
Riddick.
Looks
clear.

You
said
"clear."
I
said
it
looks
clear.
What's
it
look
like
now?
Looks
clear.
I'll
be
running
I
want
light
on
my
back,
And
check
your
cuts.
These
bad
boys
Are
we
actually
We
stay
together,
That's
all
we
gotta
do
Are
you
ready,
Johns?
Yeah.
Look,
we're
just
You
give
him
and
he'll
leave
you
He'll
leave
I
don't
get
it,
Johns.
What
is
so
goddamn
valuable
that
you're
worried
Is
there
anything
at
all
besides
your
next
spike?
Stay
close.
Wait.
Jack!



Jack.

This
can't
be
happening.
Paris,
get
back
here!
Are
you
all
right?
This
can't
be
happening.


I
was
supposed
I
never
even
saw
France.

Well,
it's
good
Do
I
even
wanna
know?
Are
we
getting
close?
Can
we
pick
up

Wanna
tell
me
We
crossed
our
own
tracks.
Why
have
we
circled?
Listen.
Do
you
even
know
Listen!
Canyon
ahead.
I
circled
once
I
think
we
should
go
now.
Oh,
I
don't
know
That's
death
row
Especially
What?
What
are
you
She's
not
cut.
Not
her.
Her.
You've
gotta
be
kidding
me.
I...
I
just
thought
I
thought
they'd
instead
of
always

I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry,
sweetheart.
Are
you
really
bleeding?
You
could've
left
me
That's
why
I
didn't
say
They've
been
In
case
you
haven't
noticed,
Look,
this
is
We're
gonna
have
to
go
back.
What'd
you
say?
You're
the
one
who
got
us
I
was
wrong.
I
admit
it.
Ok,
can
we
just
get
back
I
don't
know,
Carolyn.
Nice
breeze,
I'm
starting
to
enjoy
What,
are
you
high
again?
Just
listen
to
yourself,
No,
no,
you're
right,
Carolyn.
My
life
is
a
steaming
pile
so
I
say
mush
on.
The
canyon's
only
So
why
don't
you
butch
up,
stuff
a
cork
in
She
is
the
captain.
Listen
to
her?
When
she
was
so
willing
What's
he
This
does
not
help
us.
During
the
crash,
kill
us
in
our
sleep.
Shut
your
mouth.
We're
just
Shut
your
fucking
blowhole!
Fine.
Fine!
You've
made
your
point.
We'll
all
be
scared.
Oh,
Carolyn,
how
much
do
you
weigh
now?
The
verdict's
in.
Ain't
all
of
us
Just
realize
that?
6
of
us
left.
If
we
can
make
it
through
and
lose
just
one,
Not
if
I'm
the
one.
What
if
you're
one
of
5?
I'm
listening.
What
are
they
doing
up
there?
They're
talking
about
Battlefield
doctors
decide
it's
called
triage.
You
kept
calling
it
murder
Either
way,
Sacrifice
play.
Hack
up
a
body,
leave
it
like
a
bucket
of
bait.
Trawl
with
it.
We
got
extra
We
drag
the
body
Nice
embellishment.
Well,
I
don't
wanna
feed
'em.
I
just
wanna
keep
'em
So,
which
one
No,
no,
don't
look.
Christ.
What
the
hell's
Imam,
slow
down.
Just
a
little
All
right,
You
do
the
girl,
and
I'll
keep
It's
not
too
big
a
job
I'm
just
wondering
Like
who?
Leave
the
sled!




One
rule.
Stay
in
the
light.

Remember
that
moment.

You
should've
never
You
were
You
were
really
bad-ass.
The
chains.
The
gauge.
The
badge.
I
told
you
to
ghost
me.






Back
to
the
ship,
huh?
Just
huddle
together
Get
away
from
us.
Till
you
can't
see
That
the
big
plan?
Where's
Johns?
Which
half?
We're
gonna
lose
We
should've
stayed
He
died
fast.
If
we
have
any
choice
that's
the
way
Don't
you
cry
for
Johns.
Don't
you
dare.
Blind
spot.
Shall
we
pray
together?
I
have
already
prayed
It
is
painless.
It's
pointless.
Because
you
do
not
does
not
mean
Think
someone
can
spend
with
a
horse
bit
Think
he
could
start
out
with
an
umbilical
cord
and
not
believe?
You
got
it
all
wrong,
I
absolutely
believe
And
I
absolutely
He
is
with
us,
nonetheless.
2
of
your
boys
How
much
faith
I
only
see
one
way.
That
way.
It's
the
only
way
Just
keep
the
girl
What
about
the
cells?
I'll
take
those.
Move.
Are
you
sure
Move!


Do
not
look
up!
Do
not
look
up!
They're
killing

Keep
moving!



Riddick!
Wait!
Riddick!


Get
off
her!
Get
off
her!




He
did
not
know


Come
on.
Stand
up.
Get
up.
Come
on.
Oh,
no.

So,
where
the
hell's

Riddick!
Are
we
close?
Just
tell
me
We
can't
make
it.


Hide
here!
Now!
Why
is
he
He's
not
coming
back,



That's
the
last

Strong
survival
instinct.
I
admire
that
I
promised
them
that
we
would
go
back
Did
you?
Hmm.
What,
are
you
afraid?

Me,
afraid?
Come
on,
Riddick.
There's
gotta
be
that
wants
to
rejoin
Truthfully,
Well,
then
just
give
me
I'll
go
back
by
myself.
Ok.
There
you
go.
Please
just
come
with
me.
I
got
a
better
idea.
Come
with
me.
You're
fucking
with
me,
You
know
I
am?
You
don't
know
I
will
leave
you
here.
Step
inside.
I
can't.
Sure
you
can.
I
can't.
Here,
I'll
make
it
easy
Take
my
hand.
Come
on.
Come
on.

Look,
no
one's
Save
yourself,
Carolyn.
Come
on.
Come
on.
That's
it.
Good
girl.


You
listen
to
me!
I
am
the
captain
and
I
am
not
leaving
with
those
even
if
it
means...

Get
that
thing
Shut
up!
You'd
die
for
them?
I
would
try
for
them.
You
didn't
answer
me.
Yes,
I
would,
Riddick.
I
would.
I
would
die
for
them.
How
interesting.

Never
had
a
doubt.
Anyone
not
ready
There
is
my
God,



Don't
stop.
Don't
stop!
Come
on!
Move!
Move!
You
know
the
way!
On
board!

Carolyn.
Come.
Now.

Wait.
Riddick.
Riddick.


Ok,
hold
onto
me.
We're
gonna
get
out
of
here.
I
got
you.
Come
on.
Come
on,
Riddick!
Get
up!
I
said
I'd
die
Let's
move.
All
right.

Not
for
me.
Not
for
me!
With
so
much
prayer
I
scarcely
know
I
know
where
I'd
start.
Riddick,
what
are
you
doing?

Can
we
just
get
the
hell
We
can't
leave

without
saying
good
night.

A
lot
of
questions,
Could
even
be
a
merc
ship.
So,
what
the
hell
Tell
'em
Riddick's
dead.
He
died
somewhere
THE
END
