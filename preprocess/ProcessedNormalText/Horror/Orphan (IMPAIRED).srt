had
the
urge...
...but
that
you
resisted
it.
You
wouldn't
have
made
it

ultimately...

have
to
decide.
Hi.

Maybe
later.
It's
going
to
be
fine.
We'll
scare
her
so
bad
Here
she
comes.
Wave
your
arms
and
make
her
stop.
Max,
go.


You
all
right?
Max?
Max?
You
okay?

Stop
crying.
Grab
a
foot
Now.

Help
me
hide
her.

That
doesn't
matter.
They'll
send
you
to
jail
I
had
to
kill
her
You're
not
going
to
tell
on
me.
Don't
worry.
You're
my
little
sister.
I
won't
let
anything
happen
to
you.
I
love
you.
Tell
me
what
you
saw.
-What
are
you
doing?
I
saw
you
and
Max
in
the
tree
house.
What
else?
-What
do
you
mean?
I
didn't
see
anything.
I
swear.
-Did
you
tell
anyone?
I
didn't
tell
anyone.
Please....
If
I
find
out
that
you're
lying,
...before
you
even
figure
out
-Do
you
understand
me?
You
pissed
yourself.
It
was
nice
talking
to
you,
Alice.
I'd
like
that.
-We'll
be
right
out,
honey.
My
initial
instinct
is
that...
...there's
not
a
deeply-rooted
problem
-So
there's
nothing
wrong
with
her?
It's
not
all
good
news.
