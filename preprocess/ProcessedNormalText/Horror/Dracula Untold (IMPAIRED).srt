INGERAS:
In

Son
of

But

SHKELGIM:
where
I
found
it.
What
do
you
think,
Vlad?
Bring
it
to
me.
This
belongs
to
a
scout.
One
of
Hamza
Bey's
men.
What
the
hell's
VLAD:
Turkish
scouts
If
there's
one,
And
whatever
they
scout,
they
conquer.
This
was
washed
downstream.
Came
from
up
there.
Broken
Tooth
Mountain.
Soon
it
will
be
night.
They'll
seek
refuge.
Dimitru,
I
need
you
to
Alert
the
guards
What?
For
the
Turks
to
cross
is
a
sign
of
war.
And
what
are
you
going
to
do
I'll
do
what
Negotiate.
Nicolae,
Andrei,
with
me.
PETRU:

Anything?

Smells
like
your
feet.



VLAD:
They're
inside.
How
do
you
know?
Bats
don't
come
out
Something's
disturbed
them.
Come
on.
What
is
it,
My
Lord?
The
floor.
It's
crushed
bone.
The
Turks
didn't
do
this.


What's
that?

We
leave,
now.

You

Yeah,
I

why?
Because

You

In
