Hey,
babe,
what's
up?
-
What
is
that?
Hi.
-
Is
that
what
I
think
it
is?
I
don't
know
what
you
think
it
is,
I
think
it's
a
giant-ass
camera.
Easy
to
move
around,
versatile?
Are
you
going
to
park
the
car
or
you
This
is...
big
and
impressive.
And
it
has
a
really
bright
Light
on
it.
-
Kiss
the
camera,
please.
How
much
did
this
cost
you?
How
much
did...?
Turn
that
thing...
-
What
are
you
doing?
You
think
thisll
work?
I
think
we're
going
to
have
capturing
whatever
paranormal
Seriously,
what'd
you
Well,
about
half
as
much
Good
thing
you're
cute.
Dinner?
-
Just
keep
going
up
the
stairs.
-
AlIright,
l'Il
make
dinner.
No.
We're
just
going
to
film
and
then
when
any
weird
shit
goes
on,
we
will
be
in
a
perfect
position
Oh,
so
we
can
always,
Like,
Well,
you
know,
hopefully,
-
we
can
figure
out
what's
going
on.
Once
we
know
what's
going
on,
-
And...
Take
care
of
it,
whatever
it
is.
one
of
those
kids
and
is
trying
to
peep
through
a
window
that
will
take
care
of
them.
Unless
that
kid
has
been
following
me
-
Something
pretty
creepy.
You're
telling
me.
-
You
know,
I
realize
that
you're...
Are
you
doing
OK?
-
Are
you
talking
to
them...?
Do
you
have
enough
batteries?
You're
supposed
to
be
in
love
with
me,
We
are
going
to
be
sleeping
-
We're
going
to
what?
All
night?
You're
cute.
Yeah.
That
was
shy.
You
looked
away.
Dinny
time.
-
Test,
audio
test.
Yeah.
Can
you
just
please
talk,
please?
Hello,
Micah.
You're
the
-
except
for
your
strange
fascination
-
with
electronics.
-
What
do
you
want
me
to
say?
What
do
you
want
me
to
say?
-
Whisper.
-
Can
you
hear
me?
-
I
am
whispering.
I
am
whispering
now.
That's
a
whisper,
All
right,
sweet,
All
right,
we're
operational,
babe.
Sweet!
Do
you
know
of
any
tricks
I
don't
want
to
make...
I
don't
want
it
to
happen
at
all.
So
I
don't
want
to
force
it
to
happen.
You
know,
if
it
catches
something,
OK.
I
mean,
lama
just
saying
'cause
would
be
pretty
cool
-
It
would...
-...substantiate
your
claims.
Yeah,
of
course.
Hey.
What
is
that?
Let's
investigate
it.
We're
hearing
a
weird
sound.
You
hear
it?
Is
it
the
fridge?
It's
the
icemaker.
Damn
it!
It
will
only
come
out
I'd
Like
to
take
this
moment
to
illustrate
the
beauty
I
meant
her.
This
is
just
my
guitar.
You're
sweet.
-
What
is
this?
I
need
to
repaint
my
toenails.
You
shouldn't
film
my
feet.
Sex
type
thing.
Please?
Just
a
half
of
one.
Just
bra
and
panties.
-
No.
No.
BuIlshit.
Yeah,
the
Venus.
No.
So
where
are
we
going
to
put
it?
You've
got
the
bathroom
or
the
hallway.
I
think
it
should
point
down
the
hall,
It's
kind
of
dark.
You
can't
see
me
here?
-
Not
at
all.
Yeah,
that's
good.
-
That's
cool?
Need
more
Light?
-
All
right.
What
happened
with
-
We
could
get...
Careful.
You're
about
We
could
get
extracurricular
with
this.
I
mentioned
it
before.
-
We
could...
but
no.
Nice
try,
though.
I
just
want
you
to
know
I'm
putting
this
thing
back.
OK,
now
hook
up
the
FireWire.
-
Is
it
working?
Yeah,
I
think
it's
good.
Oh,
God.
How
am
I
supposed
to
Itll
be
fine.
It's
looking
at
me.
This
is
what
Katie
looks
Like
She
is
so
pretty.
-
What
do
you
want
for
breakfast?
"Whatever"
isn't
an
answer.
-
Sounds
pretty
good.
-
Hey,
babe?
Did
you
drop
my
keys
on
the
floor?
Hold
on.
My
keys
are
in
the
middle
of
the
floor.
I
just...
Look
where
I
found
my
keys.
-
Where
did
you
leave
them?
Are
you
sure?
Yes.
I
always
leave
them
in
Obviously,
this
is
that
evil
forces
came
from
beyond
Make
your
breakfast.
That
would
be
a
3.0
on
the
splash
scale.
-
What
are
you
doing
up
there?
-
Yeah?
Very,
very
mature.
I
think
that's
my...
I
got
a
big
one!
I
think
that's
my
favourite
quality
Big
day.
It's
the
day
of
the
psychic,
He
should
be
here
within
the
hour.
We're
going
to
go
find
Micah
My
guess?
Very
excited.
All
right,
tell
me
how
excited
-
Who
will
be
here
within
the
hour.
So
excited,
I
can't
contain
myself.
Can't
contain
yourself?
I
got
something
quite
appropriate
-
What?
Show
me.
Maybe
Ill
play
this
when
he
gets
here.
You
are
totally
not
taking
Don't
you
want
to
make
him
feel
at
home
I
mean,
this
way...
This
is
not
going
to
make
him
feel
at
home.
We're
not
going
to
insult...
Don't
you
smile
Like
How
'bout
less
music?
That
was
good.
Is
the
psychic
going
to
give
me
some
Haven't
bet
on
the
horses
in
awhile.
-
Maybe
if
you're
good.
-
Stock?
So
you'd
think
a
psychic
You
know,
Like
he
could
foretell
You're
clever.
Wait,
let
me
get
my
music.
Don't
you
even
think
about
-
Hi.
Dr.
Fredrics?
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
-
This
is
Micah.
I'm
sorry
for
the
camera.
So
can
you
see
ahead
of,
Like,
-
Like
know
when
traffic's
going
to
be
bad?
Oh,
usually
it
depends
on
the
day
-
You
know.
I
never
hesitate
when
somebody
I'm
always
ready
to
do
that.
I'm
certainly
glad
you
could
make
the
I'd
Like
to
spend
time
getting
a
bit
more
information
Getting
to
know
both
of
you,
what's
your
relationship
Like...
It's
good.
-
its
good?
That's
one
good
step.
How
long
have
the
two
of
you
-
Three
years.
We're
engaged
to
be
engaged
-
And
your
jobs?
Both
your
jobs?
I'm
an
English
major,
I
don't
know
where
yet.
-
Yeah.
-
We're
in
good
health.
-
No.
More
often
than
not,
can
be
explained
away
by
simple
things,
or
you
know,
that
has
people
more
freaked
because
So...
So
this...
has
happened
to
you
Yes.
It
started
when
I
was
eight.
I,
you
know,
and
shared
a
room
with
my
And
at
that
time
we
both,
you
know,
W
e
had...
I
would
feel
the
breathing
and
I
would
wake
her
up.
I
guess
you'd
call
it
Like
the,
Like
that
would
be
at
the
foot
of
my
bed.
It
was
always
at
the
foot
of
my
bed,
-
But
she
did
see
it.
Absolutely.
And
we
were
-
OK.
You
know,
you
just...
And
we
would
just
pray.
And
then,
eventually,
it
would.
So
this
happened
for
a
while
And
then
we...
Everyone
got
out,
no
one
was
hurt,
But
we
lost
everything.
Was
it
ever
determined
-
No.
And
l...
You
know,
lama
not
saying
I'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
Did
the
fire
department
do
any
I
don't
know
if
there
was
but
I
know
that
they
tried
to
figure
out
-
OK.
you
know,
simple
Like
that.
So
then,
from
the
time
you
were
have
you
experienced
this
periodically
Yes.
From
13
on
it's
happened,
Over
the
past
few
weeks
So
when
you
tell
me
that
it's
moved
when
you
were
eight,
someplace
else
when
you
were
13,
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
Something
that's
These
Lights
have
been
flickering,
We've
had
water
from
the
faucets
-
OK.
Not
turn
on
and
off,
We've
heard
banging
on
the
walls,
Like,
you
know,
Like
dragging
down
Most
of
the
activity
is
in
here,
Yes.
The
vast
majority
of
it.
I've
heard
whispering.
Sometimes
I
can't
understand
it,
Oh,
so
it
specifically
-
It
has
before.
Well,
I've
heard
weird
noises.
I
haven't
really
heard
anyone
That
might've
been
me
in
my
sleep.
I
can
tell
the
difference
between
you
and
something
right
here
Yeah,
so,
look.
And
I
got
Like
a
we
can
record
all
night
what...
Got
the
tripod,
wide
angle
lens,
EVP
recorder,
just
to
catch
any
sounds.
So
youll
go
to
bed
and
have
the
camera
going
-
Is
this,
do
you
do
this
all
the
time?
Our
extra
bathroom
right
there.
Guest
bedrooms.
Is
there
something
we
can
do
-
To
get
it
on
tape?
mess
with
that.
I
didn't
These
haunting,
So
if
there
is
something
negative
it
will
help
spur
on
the
haunting.
You
know
the
entity
You
shouldn't
let
your
mother
come
Stop
joking,
Micah.
My
area
of
expertise
That's
what
I've
built
my
career
on,
helping
people
get
in
touch
Communicating
with
ghosts.
The
spirits
of
dead
human
beings.
A
demon
is
something
different.
That's
an
entity
that
relates
OK.
A
lot
of
debate
and
discussion
but
it's
not
a
person.
-
OK.
Dealing
with
demons
is
not
my
area.
I'm
very
uncomfortable
with
it,
I
sense
there's
something
going
on
You
cannot
run
from
this.
It
may
lay
dormant
for
years.
Something
may
trigger
it
to
get...
and
it
will,
over
time,
OK,
I
want
to
give
you
the
name
He's
a
colleague.
He's
a
demonologist,
-
He's
in
Los
Angeles.
All
right,
check
this
out.
What
if
We
find
out
what
it
wants,
then
we
Because
what
it
probably
wants
is
Katie.
And
if
you
do
pick
up
a
board
the
entity
will
sense
that
and
that's
opening
the
door,
-
Do
you
understand
me?
I
hope
so.
You're
going
to
be
fine.
OK?
Glad
to
hear
you
say
that.
Thank
you
so
much
for
coming.
I
will
definitely
give
-
Have
a
very
safe
trip
back.
-
Nice
to
meet
you,
bye.
Do
you
think
you
could
try
not
to
be
I
feel
Like
it
was
good
information,
I
feel
Like
at
least
I'm
going
to
call
that
guy
tomorrow.
What
guy?
-
Dr.
Johann
Aviaries?
-
Don't
laugh
at
him.
Seriously,
don't
call
the
guy,
OK?
-
He
said
to
call
him
tomorrow.
No,
promise
me
you're
not
going
to
-
Want
me
to
promise?
I'm
not
putting
up
with
Like
a
team,
-
OK.
-
If
it
gets
worse
lama
going
to
call
him.
Yeah.
You
sound
way
better
Have
a
Little
extracurricular
Not
with
this
camera
on
us,
no.
OK,
taking
the
camera
off
Ten
minutes,
huh?
That's
all
l
need.
Let's
go
to
bed.
Turn
it
off.
All
right.
Ill
set
up
-
Turn
it
off!
-
Turn
it
off.
Turn
it
off!
I
want
to
pee!
Turn
it
off.
Dr.
Johann.
I
am
Dr.
Johann.
-
OK,
I'm
about
to
pee.
Go
away.
I
can't
hear
you,
I'm
here
to
save
you
from
the
demons.
Come
to
bed.
I
will!
Just
let
me
turn
Wait!
-
Excuse
me.
-
The
camera's
not
off.
That's
not
the
standby
Light.
-
Don't
Lie
to
me.
I
think
that
probably
was
illegal
This
girl
is
a
wild
animal.
What
time
you
Don't
know,
Did
you
set
Sleep
good?
Is
that
the
video?
I
was
looking
at
the
footage
Check
it
out.
-
The
doors...
You
got
it?
The
doors
and
windows
all
over
the
The
flowers
are
not
moving.
-
The
door's
fricking
moving
by
itself.
And
it's
not
over.
Check
it
out.
-
Oh,
Micah,
that
is...
-
I
told
you
this
was
a
good
idea.
You
think
you
can
get
that
ghost
back?
-
think
I
can
do
what?
Get
us
some
more
interesting...
I'm
not
interested
in
that.
Oh,
Micah!
What
are
you
doing?
What?
It's
right
there.
Get
rid
of
it.
Please.
You
scream
Like
that
for
a
spider?
-
Oh,
God.
-
Did
you
go
get
the
camera
first?
I
thought
it
was
a
ghost
I'm
nearly
losing
my
mind
Hey,
Little
friend!
What's
your
name?
Can
I
turn
the
camera
off?
-
All
right.
We're
going.
Hey,
you
out
here?
Hey,
tell
me
what
the
point
of
this
was.
Was
part
of
your
master
plan
Or
are
you
just
doing
random
shit?
Well.
Basically,
it
could
be
two
things:
It
could
be
a
ghost,
Dr.
Fredrics
said
-
And
whatever
it
is...
I'm
doing
my
research
Well,
whatever
it
is
that's
It
doesn't
feel
human.
It
feels
Like
a
monster.
Well,
that
sounds
-
Yeah,
that's
what
he
said.
Yeah.
It's
definitely
not
human.
Then
maybe
you're
right,
Basically,
they're
these
that
only
exist
to
cause
pain
and
It's
pretty
creepy.
I
mean,
they
They're
sometimes
really
intelligent
in
So
this
could
be
and
it's
cool
we
got
it
on
tape.
I'm
surprisingly
not
as
excited
as
you,
considering
lama
the
one
It's
all
good.
Well
take
care
of
it.
I
understand
that
and
exciting
in
some
ways,
But
it
isn't
new
to
me,
and
I
think
this
thing
So
I
just...
I
just
want
you
...things
progress
I
don't
want
to
mess
with
the
camera.
I
understand
where
you're
you
didn't
exactly
warn
me
-
before
we
moved
in
together.
So
I
think
I
have
I
get
that,
honestly.
On
our
first
date,
No,
but
maybe
on
our
or
when
we
decided
to
Live
together,
that
might've
been
Here.
All
right.
The
windows
are
locked,
Anything
gets
in
here,
I
don't
think
it
cares
about
It
can
go
wherever
it
wants,
How
do
you
know?
Whatever's
happening,
it's
already
here.
All
right.
What
is
this?
What's
the
matter?
I
just...
I'm
sorry,
It's
all
right,
-
Oh,
my
God.
-
Yeah.
My
head.
Did
you
hear
that?
-
lama
going
down.
Micah,
no!
Micah,
Don't
leave
me
here.
Take
this.
Where
do
you
think
that
came
from?
-
Micah!
-
This
all
you
got?
Please
don't
do
that.
You
OK,
baby?
I'm
OK.
-
You
sure?
-
Hey,
girls?
-
If
you
can
just
show
me...
I
know
it's
bead
time,
but
I
have
a
Little
something
Can
it
wait?
We're
having
and
we
cannot
be
interrupted
-
Thank
you,
OK.
I
understand.
What
the
fuck!
Hey!
You
be
sweet.
All
right.
This
is
the
tape
I
set
up
in
the
bed
room.
This
is
the
tape
from
about
What
the
hell
was
that?
I
Listened
to
it
50
times.
It's
not
a
language
that
I
recognize,
noise
from
the
street,
electrical
Interference
-
Oh,
God!
I
think
the
thing
is
This
thing
wants
to
communicate.
So,
I
figure
I'm
going
to
go
out
No!
I
don't
want
to
know
-
I
want
it
to
leave
us
alone.
He
specifically
said,
-
Whatever
it
is.
You're
going
to
use
a
Ouija
-
and
it's
not
going
to
go
away.
The
camera
is
your
thing.
Nothing.
Promise
me.
Fine!
I
promise
you
-
OK?
Hey,
Micah,
smile.
Hey,
we
haven't
had
anything
-
Micah?
What
you
got?
Put
the
camera
away,
-
Go
back
to
sleep.

really
Not

at
this
point,

Cool?

Are

it
was...
Oh,
God!
Like
if
someone

I
remember
standing
in
the
doorway
And

downstairs,
sat
in
the
swing.
I
went
to
get
you
a
blanket
Fast
forward

I'm
freaking
leaving

room.
Where...
You
went
outside
and
sat
on
the
swing.
And
I
went
inside
to
bring
you
a
blanket
'cause
you
refused
to
leave
in

I
wouldn't
call

remember
anything.
I

Look,

Got

of
possibilities.

to
a
T.
You
say...
It
just
jumped
to
you
instead.
And
he's
trying
to
warn
us,
with
this
Ouija
board,
trying
to
tell
us
Wait.
So
what
happened
to
her?
They
tried
to
get
rid
of
it,
Before
the
exorcist
got
there,
She
was
just
hearing
voices
I'm
trying
to
find
some
kind
of
reason
this
thing
would
pick
you
I
can't
find
anything.
From
what
I've
been
reading,
-
There's
just
no
reason.
Like...
She's
pretty.
Now
she
is.
I
think
this
not
to
fuck
with
it.
Oh,
God!
There's
no
way
that
we're
doing
this.
It's
gone
away
on
its
own
before.
This
is
not
worth
the
risk.
I'm
going
to
go
Lie
down.
Hey,
Katie,
I
got
a
idea
Some
more
stuff.
In
fact...
Would
you
please
get
away
from
me
All
right.
I
kind
of
want
to
talk
Micah,
please.
Go!
Please!
Hey,

out!
All
right?
I
have
ideas
I
want
to
OK,
you
and
your

What
the
fuck?!
While
you
stop
I'm
trying
to
solve
the
problem.
-
Well,

me
any
favours.
Thank

Micah.
Well,

wrong.

Well

We're

another
night.
Here,

Is

Looks
Like
