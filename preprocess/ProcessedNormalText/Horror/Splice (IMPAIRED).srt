Thank
you.
There's
been
a
lot
of
talk
tonight...
...about
advancements
in,
uh,
We've
talked
about
our
new
...disease-fighting
agents
for
livestock.
And
that's
all
very
exciting
But
let's
be
honest.
What's
exciting
for
you
people
...is
to
see
these
two
creatures,
These
are
state-of-the-art
designer
The
origin
of
a
species.
Male
and
female.
-
Like
Adam
and
Eve...
...coming
together
to
enact
nature's

Do
something.
Uh...

Well,
I
think
we
have
to
agree
that
It's
a
fucking
disaster.
What
happened?
Well,
it
was
difficult
to
examine
...but
it
seems
that
Ginger
Hormonal
changes.
Hormonal
changes?
She
turned
into
a
male.
What?
Just
like
that?
Just
changed
sex?
But
how
can
this
happen?
We
really
don't
know...
...but
clearly,
two
males
caged
together
So
your
first
living
hybrid
changes
sex,
How
is
that
possible?
We
can
re-create
them.
No
more
monsters.
We
don't
have
time
for
that.
We
need
the
gene
that
produces
CD356,
Do
you
understand?
-
We
have
to
get
it
out
of
here.
Barlow's
taking
over
every
inch
Gotta
find
some
place,
What
am
I
not
getting
here?
What
did
you
expect
when
you
made
it?
Listen,
brother,
...if
you'd
been
paying
enough
attention
GAVIN:
I
was
playing
catch-up
with
-
I
know
a
place.
I
know
a
place
we
can
take
her.
All
these
years
you've
owned
this
farm,
-
You
knew
I
grew
up
on
a
farm.
It's
not
my
farm.
It
was
hers.
-
She's
dead.
It's
all
right,
sweetie.
CLIVE:
You
know,
you
can
talk
to
me
ELSA:
CLIVE:
ELSA:
If
you
could
understand
crazy,
It's
okay,
honey.
This
is
your
new
home
now.
This
is
your
new
home.
Come
on.
It's
okay.
-
No,
no.
-
It's
just
a
barn.
Come
with
us.

ELSA:
CLIVE:
ELSA:
CLIVE:
Everything's
fine.
Is
it
really
under
control
now?
ELSA:
Okay,
you
know
what?
I
need
you
CLIVE:
Unbelievable.
This
is
the
disaster
A
new
species
set
loose
in
the
world.
ELSA:
Don't
worry,
all
right?
-
She
just
did.
You
know
what?
We're
gonna
find
her.
Where
is
it?
Go,
go,
go.
Dren?
Dren?
-
Dren,
honey?
Oh,
Dren.
CLIVE:
Ah.
It's
almost
full.
Dren...
...you
must
never,
ever
run
off
Do
you
understand?
Do
you
understand?
Dren,
look
at
me.
Bad
Dren!
Look,
I'm...
I'm
sorry,
sweetie.
I'm
not
angry
at
you.
Well,
it
ain't
the
W,
You
okay,
Dren?
Got
a
little
blanket
for
you.
ELSA:
Dren!
Maybe
we
should
move
her
No
way.
Come
on,
No,
that's
fine.
She's
just
upset.
Everything's
new.
It'll
be
okay.
Come
on,
let's
move
in.
It's
late.
You
okay?
Yeah,
of
course.
It's
just
a
house.
CLIVE:
This
was
your
room?
I
thought
you
said
your
mom
left
it
She
did.

Nice
of
you
to
show
up.
Traffic.
You
will
observe
protocol.
It's
the
only
way
Thank
you.
Shall
we,
um,
get
to
work?




Please,
honey,
not
today.
She
doesn't
like
that
stuff.
ELSA:
I'm
sorry,
is
rabbit
considered
That
was
an
accident.
Come
on.
Honey.
I
know
you're
hungry.
Eat
your
di...
What
is
it?
What's
the
matter?
What?
Tedi...
She
spelled
"tedious."
-
Where
would
she
get
a
word
like
that?
She's
telling
us
she's
bored.
Do
you
want
to
play
a
game,
sweetie?
Holy
shit.
How
did
you...?
Dren,
I
know,
but
I'm
sorry,
you
can't
-
Dren!
No,
Dren!
Stop
it!
ELSA:
Dren,
okay,
take
it
easy.
-
Okay,
hey.
That's
it.
You
come
over
here
-
Elsa!
Cool
it.
-
You
saw
what
she
did!
Did
you
not
see
what
she
did?
Fuck!
I
did.
Stop,
it's
okay.
It's
okay.
-
It's
done.
Dren,
stop!
CLIVE:
-
Dren?
CLIVE:
-
Dren?
CLIVE:
ELSA:
Come
on,
sweetie.
Come
back
inside.
CLIVE:

-
Dren,
get
back
here
this
instant!
-
No!
Dren!
Dren,
don't,
don't.
We
need
you.
Dren...
...we
love
you.
Come
here.

Elsa
not
here
yet?
Not
feeling
well.
Oh,
you
gotta
be
kidding
me.
People
get
sick.
It
happens.
BARLOW:
A
lot
of
people
would
just
You
guys
are
not
some
special
case,
Fucking
idiot.
My
mother
wouldn't
let
me
wear
makeup.
She
said
that
it
debased
women.
But
who
doesn't
wanna
be
debased
Look.
You
see
how
pretty
you've
become?
You're
gonna
have
to
learn
I
remember
how
I
felt
at
your
age.
It's
an
exciting
time.
I
never
thought
it...
Maybe
we
could
use
some,
uh,
Let's
try
some
more
eyeliner.
What
are
these?
Did
you
do
these?
These
are
really
good.
Are
there
any
of
me?
Dren,
what
is
that?
Give
it
to
me.
Give
it
to
me,
right
now.
Sorry.
You
can't
keep
her.
We
can't
take
a
chance.
Can't
always
get
what
you
want.
That's
a
part
of
growing
up
too.
Elsa?
Dren?
Shit.
Hey.
What's
the
matter,
girl?
What
happened?
Did
Elsa
do
that?
Looks
nice.
Well,
let's
lighten
things
up
around
here,
That's
good.
That's
really
good.

That's
enough.
Good
night.
ELSA:
I
must
have
slept
like
a
rock.
What?
It's
your
DNA.
What?
In
Dren.
I
can
tell.
You
put
yourself
into
the
experiment?
How
could
you...?
Ha,
ha.
What...?
What
were
you...?
Of
course
it
was.
It
still
is.
If
you
believe
that,
you're
even
more
Uh,
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean?
Maybe
you
ought
to
take
another
look
Dren?
Dren?
Hey,
Dren.
I
have
something
for
you.
Come
here.
Come
here.
I
wanna
give
you
something.
Can't
you
smile
for
me?
You
know
I
love
you,
don't
you?
You're
a
part
of
me.
And
I'm
a
part
of
you.
I'm
inside
you.
I
have
something
for
you.
Look
what
I
got.
You
can
keep
her.
Why
not?
It's
nice
to
have
a
pet.

Oh,
my
God!
Dren!
Physically,
H-50
has
evolved
well.
However...
...recent
violent
behavior

Erratic
behavior
may
be
caused
by
Cosmetically

Due
to
her

condition,
...to
remove
her

-
What
are
you
doing?
Jesus
Christ.
Elsa.
She's
become
unstable.
She
killed
the
cat.
So
you
cut
off
her
tail?
You
any
closer
to
finding
the
protein?
What
does
that
have
to
do
You
haven't,
because
you're
working
with
-
You
don't
know
she
has
it.
She
has
everything
Ginger
and
Fred
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
gonna
solve
this
thing.
CLIVE:
Dren.
Dren,
I'm...
Where
are
you?

Bill,
you're
early.
Let
me
get
this
straight.
You
stay
home
because
you're
sick,
-
Making
up
for
lost
time.
They
won't
extend
the
deadline.
It's
over.
You
screwed
us
all.
-
In
fact,
clear
out
Clive's
desk.
Well,
no
one
cares
You're
an
embarrassment
The
protein's
been
synthesized.
It's
in
the
fridge.
When
some
real
scientists
get
here,
Ouch.
Elsa?
No,
no!
No!
No.
You
can't
do
that.
You...
You
shouldn't
do
that.
You
shouldn't
do
that.
Oh,
God.
Oh,
shit.

-
EI.
Don't.
I
don't
even
quite
know
how
it
happened.
I
don't
even
know
who
you
are
anymore.
You've
become
something
sick.
Forget
about
what
it
means
to
me,
We
changed
the
rules.
You're
not
talking
your
way
out
of
this.
We
crossed
a
line
Confused
about
what?
Right
and
wrong.
Right
and
wrong.
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
You're
in
no
position
to
talk
to
me
And
you
are?
Really?
Why
the
fuck
did
you
wanna
make
her
Huh?
For
the
betterment
of
mankind?
You
never
wanted
a
normal
child...
...because
you
were
afraid
But
an
experiment,
that's
something
else.
I
love
her.
Yeah,
I
know,
but
we
fucked
up,
EI.
We
fucked
up.
Jesus
Christ.
We've
chained
her
up.
We
maimed
her.

I
just
wish
things
could
go
back

I
synthesized
the
protein.
What?
She
has
a
derivative.
It's
more
stable
than
CD356.
It's
10
times
higher
than
the
level
We
could
maybe
save
things.
I
don't
mean
us.
I
mean...
Oh,
God,
we
can't
do
that.
We
can't.
We
have
a
responsibility.
Experiment's
over.
Our
responsibility
is
to
end
it.

Dren?
Come
out,

Do
you,
uh...
...wanna
say
anything?

Almost
done?

You
hear
that?
What...?
Gavin,
what
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
sorry.
I
had
to.
It's
the
only
way.
All
right.
Let's
see
it.
-
What
did
you
tell
him?
You
think
I'm
stupid?
The
samples
you
gave
me
They
didn't
come
from
Ginger
and
Fred,
...something
that's
still
alive.
And
to
think
you
did
this
on
my
watch.
Now,
let's
see
this
thing.
It
doesn't
belong
to
you.
It
doesn't
belong
to
anyone.

Fine.
I'm
calling
a
forensic
team.
She's
already
dead.
It's
over.

don't

for
yourself.
