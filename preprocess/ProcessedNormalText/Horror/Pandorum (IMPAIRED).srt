I've
found
Cooper.
He's

Why
is
that?

Wait

Who
are
you?
-
I
need
you
to
show
me
the
way.
I
don't
like
going
that
far
down.
No
one
ever
comes
back.
We
don't
have
much
time.
We
could

Can
you

Can
you

Land

you

Yeah.
How

life
form
Or
something.
Or
something
with
us
in
the
hyperbunks.
What
do
you
mean?
I
believe
it's
the
accelerator.
The
synthetic
enzyme
that
would
help
our
bodies
to
the
environmental
From
what
I've
seen,
these
things
have
adapted
So
you're
saying
that
they're
passengers
That
stuff
in
our
blood
is
supposed
Well,
why
would
they
Maybe
they've
been
awake
-
Longer
than
him.
-
You
don't
know
what
happened
to
us?
Oh,
I've
been
around
I
know
what
I've
seen.
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
What
is
that?
It's
just
a
sedative
Then
you
take
it
Take
it
down
a
notch.
Do
you
know
-
What?
-
Pandorum.
Ever
witness
It's
not
something
It
starts
with
a
shiver,
an
itch,
a
slow
boil...
the
biological
side
effects
feeding
into
paranoia.
And
the
paranoid
A
downward
spiral.
There
is
no
shutting
off
the
heat
It'll
boil
over.
You
don't
believe
me.
I
didn't
say
that.
How
could
they
both
have
had
it?
I
wasn't
about
We
all
know
pandorum
by
any
substantial

It
has
an
emotional
trigger

How
do
you
think
you
would
react
The
truth
about
what?
Leland:
Boom.
to
the
thunder
of
earth's
Elysium.
One
small
spark
to
ignite
the
heavens
to
venture
farther
and
farther
than
any
of
mankind's
machines.
And
we
slept.
that
no
one
had
dared
before
as
three
little
Indians
Gallo:
All
flight
systems
nominal.
I
picked
up
symptoms
Mild
symptoms.
Nothing
I
thought
-
Until
we
got
the
transmission.
Leland:
All
God's
creation
ending

What
does
it
say?
You're
all
that's
left
of
us.
Good
luck.
And
Godspeed.
Earth...
is
gone?
Poof.
We
ran
a
full
sweep
of
the
grid
One
day
there,
In
one
day?
It
had
to
be
nuclear
Does
it
matter?
My
fellow
crew
members
I
wanted
to
wake
the
primary
crew,
but
my
2nd
lieutenant
Leland:
Three
little
Indians
No
more
law.
Just
three
little
souls
whose
because
there
was
then
there
was
only
one.
One
little
Indian
left.
They
were
my
commanding
officers,
men
who
had
guided
me
But
it
wasn't
them
anymore.
-
I
had
no
choice!
Leland:
One
little
Indian
left,
He
refuses
to
go
to
bed,
He
decides
to
stay
up
What
nasty
little
games
with
his
slumbering
prey.
He
was
slayer,
he
was
master.
He
was
both
God
and
the
devil.
See,
that's
what
some
would
say.
-
a
self-proclaimed
king.
Master
of
his
own
vessel.
He
just
cast
out
Just
exiled
to
the
cargo
hold
-
to
fend
amongst
themselves...
...and
scavenge,
Evil
grew.
The
king
no
longer
wanted
to
play.
So
he
returned
And
while
the
king
slept,
a
whole
new
world
of
evil
grew
as
we
wept.
Gallo's
voice:

all
know
pandorum

any

It
has
an

trigger
effect.


-

What
are
you
doing?
He's
gonna
fucking
eat
us.
It's
not
personal,
guys.
It's
just
survival
of
the
fittest.
Or
maybe
it's
the
brightest.
You
understand
what
I'm
saying?
-
You
gassed
us.
And
I'm
sorry,
and
too
tired
for
the
honorable
way
You
better
make
sure
I'm
dead...

You
don't
have
to
do
this.
Don't
sweat
it
I
wouldn't
have
survived
this
long
You
know,
a
strange
thing,
I
mean,
there's
nothing
really
left
Don't
be
fucking
stupid.
Question
is,
Trusting
the
ship
will
hold
when
it's
kept
me
alive
Or
trusting
somebody
who's
desperate
enough
just
when
I'm
about
to
carve
Listen
to
the
ship.
What
about
the
ship?
The
power
surges...
the
reactor
is
in
its
final
stage.
We
have
less
time
than
I
thought.
The
final
phase
before
shutdown,
before
we
lose
everything
and
everyone
onboard.
If
we
don't
reset
it
now,
everything
is
lost.
She
has
been
all
moody
lately.
Very
moody.
Hey,
listen.
Hey,
I
get
it.
What?
You
get
what?
You
did
what
you
had
to
do.
You
made
it.
No
one's
gonna
judge
you.
You
are
a
survivor.
And
right
now
we...
have
to
reset
the
reactor.
How
long
before
the
ship
dies?
The
truth.
I
don't
know.
Take
a
fucking
guess.
An
hour.
Less.
-
Well?
I
need
your
radio.
Bower:
Do
you
copy?
Payton,
do
you
copy?
I'm
here.
Storage
tank
Midship
sector
12,
I
think.
How
the
hell
did
you
get
all
the
way
The
reactor
is
shutting
down
fast.
I
need
you
to
access
the
memory
banks
-
and
run
a
Kolzer
complex
test.
Running
Kolzer
complex.
You're
not
gonna
like
this.
Test
says
you
have
before
complete
system
failure.
-
That's
not
much
time.
-
I
need
you
to
give
us
a
path.
Move
it.

No.
It's
a
child.
Child?

They
are
breeding.
Little
bastard.

This
is
not
gonna
work.
We
must
be
close
Great.
Gallo:
What's
so
important
The
bridge.
as
soon
as
we
get
on
the
bridge.
How's
that
going
to
help?
We
should
be
focusing
Oh,
that's
right.
He
can
do
it.
24
hours
ago
Now
you
think
he's
ready
a
nuclear
reactor?
Leland:
there's
no
point
in
even
going.
What
are
you
doing?
These
are
our
families
from
flight
personnel.
They're
all
dead.
You
think
she's
here?
No,
she's...
she's
not
here.
How
do
you
know
for
sure?
'Cause
she
wouldn't
come
with
me.
She's
not
on
this
flight.
She
left
me.

There
was
nothing
left
for
me,
so
I
enlisted.
She's
the
reason
why
I
left.
Well,
then
she
saved
your
life.
That's
very
tragic.
But
we've
got
to
move
on.
-
For
what?
-
For
what?
-
They're
all
gone.
-
There's
nothing
left.
There's
nothing
left
to
go
back
to.
You're
wrong.
Hey,
we
were
meant
to
go
on.
And
we
were
meant
to
survive.
And
now
it's
more
Leland:
-
I
remember.
Clock's
ticking.
Payton's
wife
Marianne.
I
remember.
Bower
was
right
about
one
thing:
Once
this
thing
shuts
down
What
are
you
muttering
about?
I'm
saying
once
it's
done
But
we
still
have
a
way
out
of
this.
You're
suggesting
what,
Corporal?
We
can
launch
ourselves
in
the
pods
before
the
ignition
systems
That's
suicide.
We
can
buy
a
few
days,
which
is
better
Leland:
You
can
hear
it
breathe.
Yeah,
this
is
it...
a
descent
into
hell
itself.
How
long
do
you
think
that
reactor
That
thing
could
melt
down
when
he
tries
to
fire
the
core.
This
ship
could
be
ripped
in
half.
Stand
down,
Corporal.
and
we
are
not
leaving
them
behind.
We
can't
stay
on
this
ship!
I
said
stand
down,
Corporal!
That's
an
order.

-
Whoa!

Christ
Almighty.

Don't
let
go.

He's
in.
We're
gonna
get
ourselves
-
Trust
me.
How
can
I
trust
someone
who
We
still
have
time.
-
You
have
to
listen
to
me.
Don't
do
what?
Don't
talk
to
me
like
I'm
some
child
Then
calm
the
fuck
down.
I
know
this
ship
and
I
know
what
I
know
what
she
can
and
can't
do.
If
you
want
to
stay
here
-
I
gave
you
an
order.
Corporal.
Who's
the
one
being
Who's
the
one
being
delusional?
I'm
getting
off
this
ship.
Over!


-
Don't
shoot
yourself
into
space.
-
I'm
getting
off
this
ship.
Shut
up.
It
wasn't
the
crew
-
Finish
the
code.
-
You're
the
one
with
the
symptoms.

What
are
you
doing?
It's
for
your
own
good.
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
You're
not
well.
You
just
need
the
proper
treatment.
Let
me
out,
God
damn
it!
Open
it!
It's
not
your
fault.
I
will
cut
you
to
fucking
bits.
Open
it!
Your
mind
has
turned
You're
killing
us!
We
are
all
going
to
die,
Corporal.
Holy
fuck.

-
Oh,
shit.




They're
coming.
Hurry
up!
Shit.

Come
on,
come
on,
come
on.


He
did
it.
You
were
right.
I
can
help.
I'll
help
you.
What
are
you
doing?
Are
you
still
trying
You
do
not
want
What
are
you
gonna
tell
them,
huh?
-
Bower
will
be
coming
back
here.
They'll
know
what
you
did.






Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
Quiet.
Think
about
what
you're
doing,
sir.
Shut
the
fuck
up.
They
will
never
let
you
Shut
up!
They're
everywhere.
Asshole!




-


We
both
know
who
needs
this
shot.
-
Stay
back.
I
mean
it!
What
do
you
want
from
me?
Your
mind
has
turned
against
itself.
I'm
gonna
fucking
carve
you
up.

Who
are
you?
Leland:
Whoo.
I
was
with
your
boy.
I
helped
him
get
all
this
started.
I
see
you're
a
flyer
too.


Ah.
Where's
your
lieutenant?
He's
not
my
lieutenant.
Where
are
we?
What's
happened
to
us?
The
flight
log
will
tell
us
how
long
we've
been
out

It
seems
my
mild
memory
lapse
has
finally
worn
off,
Lieutenant.
Who
the
hell
are
you?
Gallo,
Corporal.
I
was
younger
than
you
Funny,
I
can't
even
remember
what
life
It's
all
I
have.
You're
the
one
who
received
You
stayed
awake.
You
killed
your
crew.
How
the
hell
would
you
know
that?
Where
are
we?
Go
ahead,
take
a
peek.

You
tell
me.
What
have
you
done
with
us?
You
don't
get
it,
kid.
There's
no
one
left
to
judge.
Where
are
the
stars?
God?
He's
dead
along
with
There's
no
law
or
order,
no
good
or
evil.
And
you
think
you're
going
You
want
to
take
a
shot
at
me?
You
know
what?
You
are
suffering,
son.
I
can
see
it
in
your
face.
Just
imagine
just
for
a
minute,
imagine
yourself
without
the
chains
You'd
even
surprise
yourself.
It's
the
ultimate
freedom.
No.
This
isn't
freedom.
This
is
pandorum.
Oh,
pandorum.
Pandorum
isn't
I
know
it's
frightening
at
first,
Isn't
that
what
you're
feeling
right
now,
Let
go
and
on
the
other
side
Purity.
Shut
up!
You
are
resisting
what
is.
You
have
to
let
go
of
That's
just
baggage
And
we
both
know
that
didn't
work
They
fucked
up
our
planet.
And
all
that's
left
is
what
is.
This
ship
is
a
seed
from
which
we
can
create
a
new
world.
Shut
up!
A
new
world.
-
Raw,
beautiful...
...perfect.
-

is
your
own
fear.
Still
the
Boy
Scout,
There
will
always
be
law
and
you
will
pay
Even
if
that
means
I
have

-
Bower!



We've
already
crashed.
We've
been
on
Tanis
All
this
time.
I
guess
this
thing
Doesn't
float
too
well
though,
Let
go
of
your
fear.
This
is
where
I'll
push
through.
Shh
shh.
They're
coming
in.

Attaboy.

They're
coming
in.
What
are
you
doing?
Why
don't
you
shoot?



Are
you
crazy?
-
Do
you
see
that?
-
We
need
to
get
out
of
here.
Not
like
this.
Hold
on.



What?
Just
breathe.


Hey.
Hey.
Just
breathe.
It's
safe
to
wake
up
now.
