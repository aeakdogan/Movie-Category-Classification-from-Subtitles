Thank
you
for
the
horse.
-
You
liked
him?
But
I
thought
we
were
going
sailing
today.
You
promised.

Well,
that
one's
too
old.
See,
now?
That'll
do.
Come
on.
Come
on,
Mr.
E.
-
It's
broken.
Mokelock.
Now,
Edward,
we
agreed.
Mokelock
is
the
bogeyman.

where
I
am.

Did

Almost.

up.
Mokelock
wants

where
I

Mokelock
is
a
pain
in
the

HENRY:
Where'd
he
get
Mokelock
again?
BARRY:
Henry.
What's
the
matter,
Barry?
Edward's,
uh,
parents
are
here.
MRS.
BAINES:
CATHERINE:
My
husband
wonders
if
that's
true.
He
wants
to
place
Edward
in
a
hospital.
I'm
sorry,
Catherine.

HENRY:
I've
been
working
on
this
project
I
know,
Henry.
I
know.
Please
don't
take
offense,
Dr.
Kent.
-
Your
work's
invaluable
to
this
company.
We've
waited,
uh,
18
months
-
There
has
been
progress.
With
all
due
respect,
Mr.
Baines...
...I'm
not
the
one
I
wish
I
could
take
credit
for
it,
but
I
can't.
I
was
chosen
to
do
a
job.
But
if
you
think
there's
someone
better...
...or
someone
who's
more
devoted
No
one's
doubting
your
ability.
-
What
is
it,
then?
There's
no
proof
the
procedure
works.
All
you're
giving
me
is
the
belief...
...that
your
interaction
...hallucination.
I
better
get
back
to
work.
-
Thank
you.
MR.
BAINES:
-
Lucky
she
worships
you.
I
wouldn't
say
"hates."
...can't
bear
the
sight
of.

What's
the
verdict?
Well,
we've
got
another
six
months...
...and
Barry
had
to
push
for
that.
I
wanna
reverse
the
feed,
Miriam,
We've
been
through
this
a
hundred
times,
Why
not?
What
do
we
have
to
lose?
When
I
did
social
work,
...when
we
took
the
kids
out
Foster
homes
can
be
scary
at
first...
...but
eventually
they
see
Edward
is
like
that
right
now.
He's
living
in
a
world
that
is
not
healthy.
-
Let's
show
him
a
different
place.
We
reverse
the
feed
Can
you
imagine
his
shock
when
he
finds...
...he's
been
thrust
-
I
do
it
all
the
time.
You're
aware
of
what's
happening.
And
besides,
we
don't
know
I
mean,
you're
already
exhausted.
-
Have
you
been
sleeping?
-
Any
more
nightmares?
-
No.
Leave
work
here.

heard
It's
a

In

in

with
Whelan's,
Can't
you
load
him
up
REID:
This

is
caused
by
a

It
lays
dormant
until
it's

Most
likely,
he's
exhibited
symptoms
...but
the
infraction,
The
triggers
can
vary.
Uh,
usually
water-related,
He's
not
just
catatonic.
He's
disappeared.
-
For
how
long?

Lee,
I
think
we
might
be
missing
Now,
whatever
state
...there
is
a
girl
that
is
missing
...and
he
is
the
only
one
He
keeps
them
in
this
thing
Now,
he
took
Julia
Hickson
at
7:30
last
night.
Peter,
you
know
me.
What?

He
provides
them
with
food,
Now,
she
thinks
she's
been
kidnapped,
...but
it's
just
a
form
of
torture.
This
is
a
kind
of
ritual
for
him,
...and
turns
them
into
a
doll,
a
toy.

Now,
this
thing
is
fully
automated...
...and
unless
we
find
her
by
tonight...
...this
will
happen
to
her.
At
the
request
of
Mr.
Cooperman...
...we've
contacted
your
board
of
directors.
And
they've
given
their
approval.
And
so
have
Edward's
parents.
But
the
decision
is
yours.
Henry?
Yes.
-
Miriam?
She's
the
one
who'd
have
to
face
...so
I
support
whatever
decision
she
makes.
-
Can
I
ask
you
something?
If
he
wasn't
like
this,
...do
you
think
that
he
would
tell
you
There's
always
a
chance
And
there's
things
he's
done
He
hasn't
had
a
sympathetic
ear.
He
wants
someone
to
listen,
Look,
I
feel
for
this
girl,
I
do...
...but
Stargher
may
no
longer
For
severe
schizophrenics...
...there's
no
discerning
-
Is
it
possible?
...but
it
takes
months
Is
it
possible?

levels
are
too
flat.
MIRIAM:
What
happened
here?
Should
have
left
him
the
way
he
was.
He
used
to
suspend
himself,
didn't
he?
Yeah.
They're
comforted
by
the
feeling
...like
floating
in
water.
Now
this,
gentlemen,
is
the
catalyst.
The
neurological
connectic
...not
only
maps

...it
sends
the
signal
to
another
party.
All
you
need
to
do
is
tune
in...
...but
you
do
much
more
than
tune
in.
You
become
part
of
the
show.
MIRIAM:
Why
are
there
three
stations?
We
tried
joint
therapy
sessions...
...two
shrinks
for
the
price
of
one,
...and
only
talked
to
Catherine.
The
fabric
has
a
special
polymer...
Are
you
sure?
I'm
sure.
Okay
-
Response
signal.
Functioning.
We
implanted
a
touch-sensitive
microchip
...so
if
she
wants
to
stop
the
session...
...or
if
it
gets
too
intense,
...and
we
abort.
When
we
were
ready
...Miriam
and
I
auditioned...
...some
of
the
best
child
therapists
And
all
they
did
was
observe
and
report,
HENRY:

was
the
least
experienced,
...that
we
decided,
what
the

immediately,

-

anything
we've
ever
seen
before.

She's
made
contact?
She's
gone
very
deep
into
his
world.
-
It's
cold.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Well,
if
she
came
to
believe
...then
theoretically,
...that
anything
that
was
done
to
it
there...
...is
actually
done.
It's
like
the

tale
...you
die
in

could
you
raise
-

have
to
be

it
okay
if
I...?
He
knows
you're

My
friend,
uh,
Dr.
Reid,
said...
...that
it's
very
unusual,
uh,
...in
a
child
that's
this
young.
What
you
have
to
understand
is
What's
paralyzed
is
a
part
of
his
mind.
It's
so
damaged
by
the
virus
You
think
you
can
change
that?
Do
you
believe
...that
you
don't
show
anybody?
I
think
everybody
During
a
session,
when
I'm
inside...
...I
get
to
see
those
things.
I
feel
them.
With
Stargher,
I
felt
things
He's
not
even
Carl
Stargher
anymore.
He's
this
idealized
version
of
himself,
It's
the
place
for
him
to
indulge
every...
You
know,
I
don't
wanna
talk
I
could
never
do
what
you
do...
...devote
myself
I
don't
think
we'll
ever
be
able
But
you
try.
That's
your
job.
I
guess
so.
-
You
don't
like
what
you
do?
Used
to
be
an
attorney.
I
was
a
prosecutor.
What
happened?
I
had
a
case,
uh,
And
because
of
this
...that
was
tainted,
he
walked.
Charles
Gish
walked
away.
Nothing
I
could
do
about
it.
The
night
after
he
was
released...
...Margaret's
parents
came
home.
That
was
the
little
girl's
name,
And
they
found
Charles
Gish
He
was
watching
television...
...and
Margaret
was
sitting
next
to
him...
...and
he
had
cut
her
open
And
the
parents
found
Charles
figured
After
that,
Figured
I'd
just
try
to
catch
them.
Till
now.
Yeah.
You
know,
I
started
to
tell
you
Well,
that's
true,
and
it's
not.
The
dominant
side
...but
there's
a
positive
side
that--
Well,
the
way
he
sees
himself
as
a
child.
-
But
isn't
that
him?
He's
curious
about
me.
If
I
could
reach
the
boy,
What
ever
happened
to
Charles
Gish?
Old
Charlie
beat
the
murder
rap
because,
uh,
His
attorney,
uh,
milked
the
jury
Said
that
a
life
of
sexual
abuse
...and,
you
know,
what
ever
the
fuck.
Why
is
that
bullshit?
I
believe
a
child
can
experience...
...a
hundred
times
worse
the
abuse
...and
still
grow
up
to
be
somebody
...ever
hurt
another
living
being.
And
you're
sure
of
that?
Yes,
I
am.
I'm
sure
of
that.

Hey,
where
the
hell
you
been?
I've
been
right
here.
Well,
next
time
tell
me,
okay?
I
didn't
wanna
disturb
you.
You're
all
sleeping
Your

wanna
know
Tell
them
to

him.
I'll
be

there.
Thank

Stargher
have
any
pets?
Yeah,
you're
a
good
boy,
-
That's
supposed
to
help?
Anything
that
was

to

...should
make

...more
peaceful.

time
Were
you
in
water?
It
was
my
baptism.
My
father,
he
pushed
me
under.
I
think
I
had
some
kind
of
seizure.
I
think
I
was
drowning,
Nobody
helped
me.
Nobody.
Except
him.
My
father...
...he
took
me
home
that
night
...and
fractured
my
jaw.
I
was
6
years
old.
Carl.
What
your
father
did
to
you
is
evil.
What
he
did
to
you
was
wrong.
-
He
treated
you
like
a
thing.
He
was
more
powerful
than
me.
No.
No
one
should
be
treated
like
that.

Is
that
right?
In
what
world
do
you
live
in?
-
Carl,
where
is
Julia
Hickson?
No
names.
No
names!
Where
is
she?
I
know
you,
Carl.
You
wanna
tell
me.

You
know
who
I
am?
Where
is
she?
Where's
Julia?
Where's
Julia,
Carl?

-
Miriam.
That
can't
be
right.

MIRIAM:
-
No
change.
-
What
about
emergency
cessation?
Gradually
terminate
the
feed,
It
could
lead
to
massive
shock.
What's
going
on?
HENRY:
-It's
happening.
It's
not
that
simple.
-
You
stopped
it
before-
With
Stargher,
his
mind
-
She
thinks
this
is
real.
Whatever
we
do
runs
the
risk
NOVAK:
Henry.
-
No.No.
I
need
you
here.

Fucking
stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Let
me
the
fuck
out!

Let
me
the
fuck
out.
Get
me
out,
you
sick
fuck!
Fuck
you!
Let
me
out.
Do
something.
Do
something
to
end
this.
Do
some--
Do
something.

I
got
bugs
crawling
all
over
my
body.
It
gets
worse.
You're
completely
unprepared
for
this.
-
Dr.
Kent,
we've
been
over
all
this.
She
went
through
the
process
too
You
don't
know
him.
Okay
-
Be
lucky.
Come
on,
guys.

Ready?
Uh,
Peter,
the
first
few
minutes...
...will
be
very
disorienting.
Remember
to
stay
calm
and
focused.
Instincts
play
a
very
important
part
here,
-
We
have
to
go.
Peter,
you've
read
her
file.
Hit
her
with
something
personal.
And
remember,
Peter,
it's
not
real.



What
the
fuck?
Have
you
seen
him?
My
boy?
My
little
one?
-
His
father
took
him
from
me.
-
Don't
mean
I
can't
take
care
of
him.
Okay
-
Catherine.
Is
that
you?
You
all
right?
Catherine.
CATHERINE
:
Peter.
Poor
Peter.
This
isn't
real.
CATHERINE:
NOVAK
:
CATHERINE:
NOVAK:
I'm
here
to
find
Julia
Hickson.
CATHERINE:

This
isn't
real.
You
remember
that?
Catherine,
listen
to
me.
Catherine.

Catherine.
Catherine,
you
gotta
try
to
remember.
Do
you
remember
Edward?
Catherine.


Talk
to
me
for
a
sec.
Naughty
worm.

Fuck
you!
Fuck
you,
motherfucker!

Catherine,
wake
the
fuck
up
now!
[MUSIC

Catherine!
When
you
were
in
college...
...your
baby
brother
had
a
car
accident!
He
was
in
a
coma
for
six
months
And
I'm
sorry
for
saying
that!
But
you
gotta
wake
up!
God!
It's
not
real.
It's
not
real.
"It's
not
real!
It's
not
real!
Not
real!
Not
real!
Not
real!"



Peter.
-
It's
okay.

Where
are
we?
CATHERINE:
Is
this
where
he
keeps
them?
Carl.
Oh,
it's
okay.
NOVAK:
CATHERINE:
I
would
never
hurt
you.
I'm
your
friend.
And
Peter,
he's
a
friend
too.
Do
you
know
where
this
place
is?
Mm.
CATHERINE:
Even
if
Peter
doesn't
find
Julia...
...I
promise
I
will
come
back
and
help
you.
Catherine!
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
Carl.
-
I
just
can't
leave
him
here!
CATHERINE:
Carl!
-
No!
Carl.
CATHERINE:
NOVAK:
Let's
go
back!
Please!
-
I
promise
I'll
come
back!
RAMSEY:
That
means
he's
back.

Take
it
easy,
Peter.
Is
she
okay?

Take
it
easy,
Peter.
Just
breathe.
-
Is
she
okay?
Can
you
get
me
out
of
this
fucking
suit?



Let
me
get
this.
-
Yeah,
Cole
here.
Yeah,
what's
up?
I
want
you
to
go
down
...at
Stargher's
workplace
-
They
haven't
finished
the
grid.
-
Call
me
when
you
get
there.
-
I'm
fine.
-
Oh,
fuck.
-
What
happened,
Peter?
-
Who?
-
Who?
Okay.
Why
don't
you
come
Pete?

-
Cole?
Now,
what
am
I
doing
down
here?
That
machine
that
he
uses,
I
want
you
to
look
for
a,
uh,
plaque...
...or
a
metal
plate
Yeah,
I
got
it.
Uh,
it's
Carver
industrial
equipment...
...in,
uh,
Bakersfield,
California.
Okay.
I
want
you
to
find
out
...that
you
can
about
that
machine.
Who
used
it,
who
sold
it,
who
bought
it.
Just
find
out
everything
you
can.
I'm
gonna
call
you
from
the
chopper
MIRIAM:
That's
good.
HENRY:
The
FBI
has
left
the
building.
I
haven't
had
a
chance
to
clear
Novak!
HENRY:

HENRY:
There's
no
way
I
could
stop
him.
-
I'm
okay.
Mm-hm.
Come
on.
Okay
-
-
All
right.
Okay
-
RAMSEY:
What
if
your
mind
They
shot
you
full
of
drugs,
Peter.
Catherine?
Catherine,
open
this
door.
Catherine.
CATHERINE:
I
promise...
-...I'm
gonna
help
you.
Do
not
jeopardize
your
career.
You're
not
authorized
to
be
here,
It's
dangerous.
What
are
you
doing?

HENRY:
Miriam.
-
You
know
what
she's
doing.
Catherine!
Jesus.
HENRY:
What
happened?
-
She
reversed
the
feeds.
The
process
is
intended
But
instead,
she's
bringing
him
into
hers.
Come
on!

I
promised
I'd
come
back
and
help
you.
See,
I
always
keep
my
promises.
Can
I
stay
here
with
you?
No,
honey,
I'm
sorry.
There's
nothing
I
can
do
about
that.
CARL
:
When
I
was
a
little
boy...
...I
found
this
bird.
And
he
was
injured...
...had
a
broken
leg
or
something.
Well,
my
father
found
out
that
I
had
it.
And
I
knew
that
he
would
It
was
just
a
matter
of
time.
So
I
took
it
to
the
sink
and
I
held
it
under.
It
was
better
for
the
bird.
I
saved
him.
I
can't
do
that,
Carl.
I
won't.
It
doesn't
matter.
He
found
me.
He
always
finds
me.

Agent
Novak?
Go
ahead.

Cole?
The
hoist
was
sold

tried
to
build
a

Bainbridge

up

And

Oh,
you're
fucking
kidding
me.

Stargher.

Where's
the
land?
-
We're
on
our
way
now.

Help!
Help
me!
PILOT:
CATHERINE
:
My
world,
my
rules.


Do
it.
It's
not
real.

Me-god
boy-
Boy
me-god.

You
cannot
kill
me.

It's
okay.
Save
me.
You
can
stay
here
with
me.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Swim
to
the
back.
Back
away!

Henry.

It's
okay.
Are
you
okay?
You
okay?
You're
okay.
You're
okay.
Hey.
Hey.





MAN
:
Agent
Ramsey?
MAN:
RAMSEY:
Somebody
outside
for
you.
What
is
she
doing
here?
Said
she
wanted
to
see
his
home.
NOVAK:
She's
keeping
his
dog.
Pretty
fucking
strange
I
almost
didn't
recognize
you.
How
long
do
you
get
to
be
a
civilian?
A
couple
weeks...
...until
after
the
inquiry
Ramsey
told
me
What
do
you
call
that
thing?
-
Reversal?
-
With
the,
uh,
kid
you
were
working
with?
Edward.
Are
you
sure
you
wanna
do
that?
Absolutely.
You're
not
worried
I
would
never
do
anything
to
hurt
Edward.
It
wasn't
him
I
was
worried
about.
What
about
you?
How
are
you?
I'm
not
sure.
I...
I
kind
of
remember
pieces
of
everything.
According
to
the
FBI,
um...
...you
guys
put
me
...which
then,
uh,
triggered
a
memory
...and
officially
we
found
Julia
Hickson...
...through
good
old-fashioned
detective
work.
I
guess
this
is
hello
and
goodbye,
then.
I
guess
so.
Thanks
for
everything,
Catherine.


-
Be
safe.
