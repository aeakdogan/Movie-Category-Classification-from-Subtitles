Where's...

Everywhere.

Oh,
balls.

Get
that
thing
away
from
my
pumps!
It's
just
overheating.
I
need
to
get
to

You

I'm
just
cherry.
Go

anywhere.
Here,
take
this
with

Didn't
I

There's
a
packed
suitcase
Give
it
to
Tony
to
take
with
him
I'll
leave
him
watching
TV.
But
you
need
to
be
here
Thank
you.
Hey,
what
happened
to
your
tooth?
Fell
out.
Wow.
Think
you
can
say
a
prayer
No
dead
bodies
for
Da-da
tonight.
No
dead
bodies
for
Da-da
tonight.
Amen.
Who
was
that
you
were
talking
to?

What's
so
special
about

Been
open
25
years.
You
should've
thrown
a
party.
I
did.
See
the
balloons?
You're
the
second
person
Who's
the
first?
Right
there.
Must
be
passin'
through.
Seems
only
strangers
eat
here.
I
still
eat
here,
J.T.
Oh,
yeah,
you
sure
do.
By
the
way,
don't
choke
Hello,
Palomita.
I
don't
go
by
that
name
anymore.
Why
not?
because
it's
the
name
you
gave
me.
So,
uh...
you
ever
become
that--
Never
did.
I
thought
for
sure
you
would.
Talked
about
it
enough.
That's
the
problem
with
goals--
they
become
the
thing
you
talk
about
That's
my
jacket.
I
looked
for
it
for
two
weeks.
Yeah?
How
long
did
you
Yeah,
well,
the
jacket
belonged
to
me.
So,
um...
what
are
you
doing
now?
I'm
going
to
be
a
standup
comedian.
Really?
You're
not
funny.
That's
what
I've
been
trying
but
they
all
say
I'm
hysterical.
But
you're
not.
Great.
Well,
that's
just
fantastic,
because
I
believed
everybody,
Now
what
am
I
gonna
do?
Yeah.
Yeah,
that--
There's
a
difference
and
being
dick.
Yeah,
well...
it
was
really
good
seeing
you
again.
Oh.
Um...
what
name
do
you
go
by
now...
in
case
I
want
to
catch
Cherry.
Cherry
Darling.
Sounds
like
a
stripper.
No,
it
sounds
like
a
go-go
dancer.
There's
a
difference.
Right.
Well...
you'll
always
be
Palomita
to
me.
I
need
a
ride.

What
do
you
say,
El
Wray?
I'll
give
you
a
ride.
Good-bye,

Bit?
Bit
by
what?
Well,
if
I
told
you,
I
need
some
Bactine
or
something?
Whew.
Can't
you
just...
sew
it
up?
Well,
normally
I
would.
I'd
even
be
doing
something
The
only
problem
is

When

one

Whew!
Chronic

When
he
urinated,
it
came
out
kind
of

a

Oh,

Well,
how'd
you
treat
it?
Fuck
that.
I
was

like

He's

of
105.

Is
that
bad?
Bad
will
be

You

And--
and
probably

Say
"ahh."

Ahh.
Oh,

Asshole.
It's

Holy

When
did
you

Can't
I
just
get
We
gotta
lose
the
arm,
Joe.
Lose
the
arm?
It's
spreading
all
the
way
Now,
if
we
don't
sever
that
arm
now,
and
we
can't
very
well
Well,
shouldn't
I
get
a
second
opinion?
Hi,

I'm
going
to

you
won't

anything

My

that?
People

What,
like
an
armadillo?
Deer.
You
get
a
lot
of
them
around
here.
You
know,
I
read
a
statistic
that
said...
that
the
eating
of
venison
has
risen
60%
of
that's
from
road
kill.
People
eat
road
kill?
If
you're
driving
out
here
and
a
deer
darts
out
if
you
blink
or
brake
or
swerve--
shit,
you'll
just
kill
yourself.
So,
what
do
you
do?
Just
pick
them
off...
just
like
this.
Send
it
flying
away
from
you.
Unacceptable.
Not
really.
It's
just
a
clear
case
of
you
or
him.
Or
her.
Oh,
fuck!
CHERRY:
Aah!
Aah!

It
wasn't

Well,

after
we

Okay.
Okay!

Not

And
here
I
stick
my
neck
out
for
you.
I
stick
it
out
far.
Now
you've
got
a
gal
in
your
wrecked
truck
A
missing
leg
that's
now
missing?
And
here
you're
saying
that
someone
up
and
snatched
it?
And
that
you
shot
at
them
with
a
gun
that
you
never
should've
had
And
that
now
they're
gone?
What
if
I
find
the
leg?
So,
now
you
know
where
it
is?
You'll
tell
us
where
it
is,
Sheriff,
can
we
finish
My
thought
exactly.
I

it

a
little
arrogant
"Best

But,

who's
gonna
come
in

Oh,
yeah.
Mm.
I'm

He

Motherfucker.

He's

Broke
out

Where's

Found

Fine.
But

Don't

Viral

They
came
pouring
in.
Some

rapidly
developing
Highly

What

you
think?
Self-preservation
comes
to
mind.
Yeah.
Let's

First
let

So

Motherfucker.
Look

Look

I

comedian.
But

gonna
laugh
now?
Some
of
their
best
jokes
Let's
go.

Would
you
stop
cryin'
over
fuckin'...
spilled
milk?
I
have
no
leg!


Now

do.
You
could
carry
me,
Wray.
Yeah?
You
never
wanted
that
before.
Why
start

Ah-ah!
Uhh!
Ahh!
Uhh!
This
is
fucking
ridiculous.

The

Get

God

wait
for
me.
My
leg's
stuck
in
the
door!
-
It's
just
wood.
Will
you
just
leave
it
alone?
Why
is
this
happening
to
me?
I
don't
know.
Just--
stay
strong.
"Stay"?
Yeah,
baby.
Stay.
Okay,
my
name
is
Electra.
Fucking
listen.
My
name
is
Electra.

It's

No.
He's

She

I

El.
Does

make
You
can
call
me
whatever
the
fuck

Oye,
chica.
-
You
said
10:00!
We
can't
be
watching
your
kid
Your
friend
never
showed
up,
That's
right.
Then
start
doing
it.
Oh!
Uhh!
Tony!
We're
leaving!
Wait,
my
tarantula.
Bring
it.
Let's
go.
And
my
turtle.
And
my
scorpion.
We're
not
all
octopuses.
"Octopi."
Ohh...
come
on,
let's
go.
Tony,
what
did
I
tell
you?
You
can't
bring
them
all.
It's
okay.
They
can
live
What
about
my
pocket
bike?
It's
in
the
trunk.
Aah!
Where
do
you
think
you're
going,

We're
gonna
fuckin'
kill
you!


Are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
this?

SHERIFF
HAGUE:
You're
all
deputies
Except
for
you,
Wray.
Yo.
What
do
we
got?
Something's
wrong
up
there.
J.T.
always
comes
out
and
greets.
Let's
go.
Try
not
to
shoot
yourselves.
Don't
shoot
each
other.
But
especially...
don't
shoot
me.

J.T.?
Go
on!
Get
off
him,
Rusty!

God
damn,
J.T.
Yah!

-

Barbecue?
Asshole.
Damn
good
sausage
link,
J.T.
Best
in
Texas.
Must've
passed
out
Nice
shootin'.
Everybody
gather
up
supplies.
We
head
out
in
20!
I
think
I
nailed
it.
Holy
shit,
I
think
I
finally
cracked
it.
I
finally
found
my--
Your
blood's
in
it.
God
damn
it,
he's
right.



Hey,
my
other
tooth
fell
out.
Heh.
It
sure
did.
Hey,
your
tooth
fell
out,
too.
We're
toothless
buddies.
Oh,
we
sure
are.
I
want
you
to
open
that
for
Mommy.
Now,
take
the
gun.
Careful.
And
if
anyone
comes
to
the
door
I
want
you
to
shoot
them,
okay?
I'm
not
kidding,
Tony.
You
shoot
them...
just
like
your
video
games.
You
shoot
them
in
the
head.
What
if
it's
Dad?
Especially
if
it's
your
dad.

And
be
careful
You'll
blow
your
own
face
off.
I'll
be
right
back.
I
love
you.



Tony!
Aah!
Hello,
baby.

Ohh!

I'm
gonna
eat
your
brains...
and
gain
your
knowledge.
Stay
away!
Look
what
you
did
to
our
son!
Stay
away!
God
damn
it,
I
told
you
Daddy!

Get
your
sorry
ass
in
here!
Aah!
If
it's
escape
vehicles
you
want,
Right
this
way.
Watch
that
meat.
Meet
my
wife.

Jesse
James
Custom
Dominator.
I
made
Jesse
a
plate
of
barbecue
he
made
this
baby
for
me
Got
anything
that
could
Where's
the
top?
This
baby's
chopped
permanent.
Ain't
got
no
roll
bar,
chicken
wire,
-
No
protection.
Nitrous-injected,
Who
are
you?
I
mean,
really.
Wray's
Wreckage.
That's
what
it
says
on
your
truck.
Are
you
a
wrecker,
Wray?
I'm
nobody.
It's
the
easiest
thing
to
remember.
So
remember
it.
J.T.:
Just
stack
them
Hey,
you
want
some
barbecue?
Heh
heh
heh.
Best
in
Texas.
Aw,
no,
thanks.
What's
the
matter,
Oh,
I
eat
meat.
I
also
eat
lots
of
shit.
You
see
this?
What's
that?
Shit-eating
grin.

You
ought
to
be
a
comedian.
What
do
you
think
of
the
leg?
Oh,
that's
funny.
How's
your
stump?
They
knocked
it
out
something
fierce.
Still
can't
feel
a
thing.
This
must
be
the
real
Bone
Shack.

Old
J.T.
knows
how
to
live.
Like
fuck
he
does.
I
like
how
you
say
"fuck".
Good.
Fuck
you.
Fuck
me?
Oh,
so,
now
you're
the
comedian.
Go
ahead,
drop
your
pants.
That'll
be
good
for
a
laugh.
I
highly
doubt
that.
That's
my
jacket.
Yes,
I
know.
I
looked
for
it
for
two
weeks.
Look,
you
were
being
I
was
walking
out
on
you.
I
was
cold.
So,
if
you're
gonna
go
on
one
of
your
about
a
fucking
jacket,
because
I'd
rather
fucking
freeze
Did
you
find
what
was
in
the
pocket?
Fuck
no.
Look
for
it.
No,
the
other
one.
I
was
gonna
give
it
to
you,
You
took
the
jacket.

Read
it.
"Two
against
the
world."
Remember
that?
I
never
forgot
it.
Then
why'd
you
leave?
Because
you
didn't
believe
in
us,
or
in
me.





I
figured
one
of
them
new
deputies
but
not
you,
Tolo!
Sorry.
I'm
sorry.
-
Dumbass.
-
McGraw's
here.
-
And
a
whole
bunch
of
others.
Come
on!
Over
here.
Move
your
ass!
Come
on!



What
did
I
tell
you,
Tony?
Don't
point
the
gun
at
yourself.
Didn't
I
tell
you
that?
Thank
you
for
telling
me
about...
you
know.
Don't
mention
it.
That's
an
order.
If
I
had
known
that
you
were...
El
Wray...
I
wouldn't
have
given
you
I
didn't
mean
to
be
a
prick
about
it.
Need-to-know
basis,
that
kind
of
shit.
Take
this.
Do
what
you
do
best.
No,
you're
not!
Don't
give
him
the
gun.
Not--
Give
him
the
gun,
Tolo.

Give
him
the
gun.
Give
him
all
the
guns.

Holy
shit.
That
boy's
got
the
devil
in
him.
We
gotta
fight
them
off.
Get
to
our
vehicles.
Everyone
behind
me!



Outside
now!

God
damn
you!

Everybody
back
inside!
You,
Skip.
Front
and
center.
You
go
out
front,
We'll
need
it
to
transport
You
fuckin'
crazy?
-
I'll
cover
you.
I
never
miss.
Come
on,
Skip.
It's
go-go.
Not
cry-cry.
Cherry!

Oh,
dear.

-


Aah!
J.T.!
You
take
whoever
you
can
fit
Everyone
else
on
board!
Skip,
grab
the
twins!
You
take
the
chopper.
I
need
someone
else
I'll
do
it.
You're
bleedin'
like
a
stuck
pig.
Your
vision's
blurred
Anything
else?
Don't
wreck
it.
Somebody
grab
the
slaw!
You
can't
have
no
barbecue
-
Give
me
a
gun.
Fucking
cool!
All
right,
y'all,
head
out.
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
Bye,
Daddy.
Do
you
remember
how
to
ride
a
bike?
Useless
talent
number
32.

Good.
Anyone
else
have
a
car?
Now,
you're
sure
you're
okay
Hell
yeah.
Dakota...
Thanks.
Your
engine
is
shot
But
I've
got
his
pocket
bike
Is
it
fast?
Zero
to
fifty
in
four
seconds.
You
ride
with
her.
I'm
Cherry.
You
sure
are.
Move
out!
Damn
shame.



-

-

God
damn
it!
Aah!


Sheriff!
How
much
ammo
we
got?
Not
enough.

Don't
shoot!
MULDOON:
Especially
you...
El
Wray.
I
don't
go
by
that
name
anymore.


It's
okay.
It's
okay.
We're
here
in
quarantine

Where
is
here?
CHERRY:
The
old
army
base.
El
Wray?
That
you?
He's
with
them.
I'm
a
scientist...
and
a
businessman.
Which
is
why
he's
gonna
tell
us
They're
stealing
biochemical
weapons.
DC-2?
Also
known
as
"Project
Terror."
Designed
to
take
out
an
entire
populace
You
were
supplying
it
to
them.
-
That's
why
they
shut
you
out.
It's
under
our
feet.
Ten
stories
down.
What
about
countering
Interferes
with
the
neurotoxic
delivery,
and
you're
gushing
blood
and
pus
Appetizing.
The
only
treatment
It
delays
the
negative
effects.
They
need
it...
like
a
drug.
Correct.
But
we
found
that
are
not
affected
by
the
gas
itself,
and
within
this
small
percentage
What
do
you
want
to
do?
Mexico.
Put
our
backs
against
the
ocean
and
defend
ourselves
from
there.
No.
We
have
to
get
back
to
my
lab.
This
infection
will
spread
to
every
man,
woman
and
child,
unless
I
finish
my
antidote.
You
have
an
antidote?

You!
You!
Come
with
us.
Move
it!
Move
it,
Peggy!
Uhh!

I'm
sorry?
Ava
Gardner.
Yeah,
I
guess.
I
was
just
thinking
that
you,
uh...
kind
of
look
like
Ava
Gardner

You
got
something
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
You
got
nothing
to
say,
huh?
because
I
could've
swore
you
just
You
want
to
say
"fuck
you"
to
me?
Not
at
this
moment.
You
know
what
this
is?
A
gun.
It's
simplicity
itself.
You
see,
you
point
it
and
you
pull
the
little
trigger
here...
and
a
little
bullet
comes
out
of
here.
And
the
little
bullet
And
you
know
what?
You
don't
look
like

Don't
taunt
me,
tramp.
I
am
not
one
to
be
taunted.
You
got
it?
Let
me
here
you
say,
"I
got
it."
I
got
it.
You
damn
well
better.

Tool.

J.T.:

I
figured
it
out.
Salt.
Got
it
all
figured
out.
It's
salt.
Blood
is
salty.
That's
all
my
sauce
needed,
It
just
needed
a
little
thickening
agent.
What
are
you
doing,
J.T.?
That's
all
I
gotta
do,
It'd
just
do
the
same
goddamn
thing
I
tell
you
what,
brother,
Don't
do
nothin'
stupid,
J.T.
It's
already
got
my
sweat,
it's
got
my
tears.
-
Drop
the
gun!

-
Do
it
now!
Don't
shoot!
J.T.,
you
all
right?

Uhh!
Hey,
you
all
right,
bro?
J.T.:
God
damn
it,
Not
at
all.
Wait
here.
Oh...
I
sure
will.

Goddamn
sauce.

See
them
in
love.
See
them
in
terror.

I'm
gonna
go
get
my

wet.
She's
got
one

Easier

You
got
a
point.
Get
the
rest
of
this
shit
upstairs
Yes,
sir.



Get
Lewis
down
here.
He's
getting
his
dick
wet,
sir.
Get
him
the
fuck
down
here
now!

Lewis?
Wilson?

Where
are
my
men?
I've
got
several
right
here.

What
the
fuck's
this?
Their
balls,
sweetheart.
I'm
walking
out
of
here
-
Let
us
go.
Because
I
earned
it.
How
do
you
figure
that?
You
want
the
story?
A
termite's
nest
of
caves
me
and
my
men
walking
around
and
our
balls
in
our
throats,
-
Bin
Laden.
For
once,
our
intel
I
come
around
a
corner--
bam,
there
he
is,
Wait.
You
killed
bin
Laden?
I
put
two
in
his
heart,
So
that
was
you.
Yeah.
That
was
me.
Class-A
clusterfuck.
He
wasn't
supposed
to
be
there,
and
I
sure
as
fuck
wasn't
supposed
to
be
So,
instead
of
a
chest
full
of
medals,
No
cure.
That
is,
not
until
we
found
willing
to
sell
us
batches
of
this
shit.
Science
comes
first,
but
business
WRAY:
Then
you
realized
if
you
could
the
experiment
and
its
survivors,
you'd
find
a
cure.
I
swore
to
my
men
to
keep
them
alive.
And
that's
what
I
intend
to
do,
Wray.

Understand?
I
never
had
a
choice.

Neither
do
I,
sir.
God
bless
you

You're
a
doctor?
Heh.
I
was
earlier
tonight.
I
always
wanted
to
be
a
doctor.
Instead,
I
can
do...
this.
Ohh.
Useless

I'm

DAKOTA:
A
girlfriend
of
mine
She
said
at
some
point
in
your
life,
you
find
a
use
for
every
useless
talent
It's
like,
uh,
connecting
the
dots.
I'm
not
that
optimistic.
I
feel
like
I'm
sinking
down
the
drain
She'd
say...
when
you're
stuck
in
that
spiral...
you
reach
up.
What
if
there's
nothing
up
there?
Just
reach
up.
You're
a
dancer.
I
was
earlier
tonight.
Well,
I'm
pulling
you
out
of
retirement!

Get
your
ass
up!
Now,
I'm
starved
for
entertainment,
baby,
Radio!
##
Wail,
baby,
now!
#
Goin'
to
a
party...
#
That's--
That's
what
I'm
talkin'
about.
Dance
it
up.
Keep
dancing!
#
because
now
I'm
jaded...
#
I
have
seen
me
but
ain't
never
seen
me
I
have
seen
me
a
stripper
and
I've
seen
me
a
stripper
and
I've
seen
me
a
stripper
but
I
ain't
never
seen
me
And
I've
been
to
Morocco.
Dance,
bitch!
Break
a
leg!
Break
it
off!
Ha
ha!

Dance
for
me,
motherfucker.
-
Uhh!
Aah!
Ohhhh!

You
thought
it
was
pretty
funny,
Actually,
yes.
You
gave
me
some
wood,
now
I'm
gonna
give
you...
some
fuckin'
wood!
Ah--
ah!


Ahh!
The
gas!
You
need
your
gas!
No!
Fuck
the
gas,
fuck
it.
I'm
just
gonna
have
to
make
this
quick.


Aah!
Uhh!
Where'd
you
get
that?
Useless
talent
number
37.
Aaaaah!



Uhh!
Uhh!
I
broke
my
leg.
That's
okay.

I
do
believe
in
you.
Always
have.
I
believe
that
you
could
be
better.
You
deserve
better,
even
better
than
me.
Right
now,
I
need
you
to
become...
who
you're
meant
to
be.
Stand.

I'd
stand
clear
if
I
were
you.

Open
that
door,
will
you,
baby?
Uhh!


They've
destroyed
most
of
the
tanks.
Any
that
are
left
There
are
two
helicopters,
big
enough
to
take
all
of
us.
Who
can
fly?
Can
anyone
else
fly
a
helicopter?
I
can
fly,
but...
no
way
in
hell
I'm
gonna
fly
tonight.
Okay.
Cool.
I'll
fly.
Let's
go.
I
think
we're
gonna
stay
here,
Wray.
You'll
take
care
of
this
for
me,
With
pleasure.
Three
minutes.
Your
brother's
a
good
man,
J.T.
Best
in
Texas.
Hop
on.
No,
the
other
way.
Oh.
No.
The
other
way.


The
helicopters
are

We
make
a
run
for
it!
No!
If
we
all
get
killed,
Don't
you
get
it?
We're
the
antidote.
Well,
is
there
another
way
around?
Wait
here.


I
don't
suppose
there
are
any
other
-

We
have
to
get
over
that
wall!
I
was
thinkin'
we
could
build
us
right
there
where
the
old
one
was.
You
cook,
I
work
the
back.
You
don't
make
that
rent
We
share
the
recipe,
Start
at
250
degrees.
I
knew
it.
For
how
long?
-
12
pounds?
12
pounds,
12
hours.
Wrapped
in
tin
foil,
right?
I
don't
use
no
goddamn
foil.
Damn.
Tomatoes?
Fresh?
Canned.
-
No
shit?
You
score
me
some?
Oh,
yeah.
because
we're
brothers.
Thank
you
for
this.
You
just
remember...
you
got
to
take
this
recipe

I
think
I
can...


That's
our
cue.
Cherry,
darling...
it's
all
you.


Let's
go!



Aah!
Wray!
Damn
it,
Wray.
Ohh.
Okay.
You
need
to
get
up
They
told
me
I'd
find
you
here.
I
was
beginning
to
lose
hope.
I'm
sorry...
but
I
lied.
I
did
want
to
hurt
you.
My
turn.

No
more
dead
bodies
Never
did
like
that
son
of
a
bitch.
About
as
useless
Don't
touch
anything.
I
want
to
fly
it.
-
He
said
not
to
touch
anything!
-
I
do
know
what
I'm
doing!
-
Shut
up!
Shut
up!
and
don't
fuckin'
touch
anything!

Everybody
sit
down!
Whoo!

Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

Hit
the
wipers.
Go
on,
leave
me.
I
am
not
leaving
you
here
like
this.
Motherfuckers
around
here

See?
I'm
funny.
I
made
you
laugh.
Go
to
the
ocean.
Put
your
backs
to
it.
I'm
not
leaving
you,
Wray.

It
will
be.
I
promise.
I
never
miss.
Don't
worry,
baby.
You'll
find
your
way.




Reach
up!
DAKOTA:
Reach
up!

CHERRY:
It's
like
you
said
I'm
like
you
said
I
would
be.
I
find
the
lost...
the
weary...
those
that
have
no
hope.
I
find
them
and
I
lead
them...
to
a
land
we've
made
for
ourselves.
The
land
by
the
sea.




CHERRY:
It's
beautiful.
She's
beautiful.
I
wish
you
could
see
us,
us
two.
It's
like
you
said
it
would
be.
Two
against
the
world,
baby.
Two
against
the
world.
