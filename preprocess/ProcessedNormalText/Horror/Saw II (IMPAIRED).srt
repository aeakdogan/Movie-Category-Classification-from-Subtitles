Jigsaw.
Who

is
Jigsaw?
You
don't
watch
JONAS:
No.
Who
is
he?
He's
a
serial
killer.
No,
he's
not.
He's
testing
us.
But
you
have
to

you
And
what
if
I
give
you

If
you
agree
to
that,
If
I
don't

my
son
again,
I'll
rip

said
he
wants
Well,
maybe
you
Five
minutes,
KERRY:
He's
not
gonna
respond
RIGG:
Don't
underestimate
I
am
the
one
who
I
have
been
spending
Maybe
that's
why
and
you
can't
understand
Don't.
I
don't
wanna
talk
to
him.
Listen,
because
you
got
It's

Shit.
Hey,
wait
a
minute.
I'm
gonna
find
an
antidote,
JONAS:
What?
Antidote?
You
talked
to
the
guards
You
know
there
Look
at
this.
You
hear
that?
It's
wood.
Plaster.
All
I'm
saying
is
Well,

ADDISON:

Shit.
RIGG:
Clear
the
room.
Okay.
Let's
talk.
Sit
down,
Eric.


I
want
to
play
a
game.
The
rules
are
simple.
All
you
have
to
do
is
listen
to
me.

If
you
do
that
long
enough,
in
a
safe
and
secure
state.
We
haven't
been
I
thought
you
liked
No,
no.
It
was
who
coined
I
never
encouraged
The
jigsaw
piece
was
only
ever
that
that
subject
A
vital
piece
of
This
is
all
really,
but
right
now
I
am
talking
to
you.
You're
not
listening.
Don't
forget
the
rules.
I'm
listening
to
you,
but
all
I'm
hearing
that
comes
about
with
one
of
you
Well,
that's
Aren't
you
supposed
lulling
me
into
It's
a
little
hard
The
manual?
What
do
you
What
would
you
have
done
Would
you
have
Would
you
have
broken
my
jaw
You
seem
to
know
I
know
you
were
Do
you
feel
a
whole
lot
I
feel
a
whole
lot
But
you
feel
alive.
And
that's
the
point.
Would
you
kindly
get
me
I
would
very
much


Fuck!
Well,
we've
established
that
the
macho-bullshit
Any
other
suggestions?
Look
who's
talking.
The
only
door

Why
don't
you
shut
Why
don't
you
That's
right,
Asshole!
What
you
gonna
do?
Okay,
man.
All
right.
We've
established
that.
Did
you
find
anything?
No.
Nothing.

So,
that
ink
on
your
arm,
Yeah.
So?
Well,
I
did
I'm
proud
of
you.

And
you,
What's
your
point?
JONAS:
My
point
is,
by
teaching
That
makes
three
of
us
I
think
we
should
'cause
that
tape
said
I
say
the
three
of
us
Hey!
I
found
XAVIER:
I
need
the
flashlight.
Over
there.
What

fuck?
Oh,
shit!
Hey!
Damn,
kid.
Sorry.
"Obi."
What
the
fuck
is
a
Obi?
Obi.
It's
my
name.
JIGSAW:

Hello,
Obi.

For
years,

with
your
lies,

Now
you'll
have
a
chance

for
the
games

by
playing
one
of
mine.

Inside
the
device

for
the
poison

One
is
my
gift
to
you

The
second
is
yours
to
donate.

However,

Remember,
Obi,

once
you
are
in
hell,
Wait
a
minute.
How
would
I
know?
The
car.
It
was...

I
knew
I
knew
him.
You're
the
last
person
I
saw
You
did
this.
JONAS:
Are
you
sure
it's
him?
I'm
sure.
You
would
have
done
the
same.
I'll
give
you
a
choice.
You
got
five
seconds
I
don't
know
the
way
out.
Bullshit!
You
put
us
in
here.
No,
I
can't.
Then
you're
a
dead
man.
So
are
you.
He's
not
gonna...
Okay,
we
got
two
antidotes
We're
wasting
time
here.
He
kidnapped
me
in
We
don't
even
know
You
willing
to
stick
DANIEL:
Okay,
wait.
I
mean,
there's
two.
We'll
work
that
out
later!
Right
now
or
I'll
kill
you
Shit.
If
you're
gonna
you
may
as
well
I
guess
I'm
going
in
there
But
I
get
one.
Ah-ha.
One
for
me.
Hurry
up.
Come
on,
baby.
Thank
you,
Obi.
Come
on.
Oh,
shit.
Open
the
door!
It's
locked.
Open
the
door!
Open
the
fucking
door!
Come
on!
OBI:
The
door!
The
nail!
I
can't
get
it
open!


Get
him
out
of
there!
Use
your
coat!
Come
on!
He's
burning
up!
Stop
it!

Come
on!
Turn!
Turn!
Stop
it.
You
gotta
put
My
man's
dying!
Guys,
there's
He's
got
the
antidote.
Get
him
out.
Ow!
Hurry!
Fuck!
LAURA:
Stop
it!
Shit.
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
Get
out
of
the
fucking
way!
Here.
Shit!
Come
on!


XAVIER:
The
needles!
He
ain't
got
I
want
the
fucking
needles!
JONAS:
Calm
down.
Fuck!
JONAS:
The
needles
They're
gone.
AMANDA:
He
had
a
choice.
RIGG:
Another
one
How
much
more
time
We're
not
wasting
time.
We're
doing
exactly
until
the
tech
team
It's
not
what
it
JIGSAW:

You
see,
Detective,
and
survival
of
the
fittest,
no
longer
applies
We
have
a
human
race
or
the
will
to
survive.
What
the
fuck
do
you
want?
It's
hard
to
when
your
son
I
can't
give
you
what
I
told
you
what
it
is.
Just
remember
the
rules.
No,
you
said
Then
you
said
you
You're
talking,
What
do
you
think
What?
What
is
it?
I
don't
know
what
it
is,
but
I
know
for
your
own
sick
I've
never
murdered
Yeah,
well,
and
forcing
them
Since
when
is
force
Why
are
you
so
desperate
'Cause
he's
my
son.
What's
the
last
Well,
then,
go!
Seems
to
me
that
is
causing
you
to
act.
Forgive
all
his
sins,
Why
is
it
that
we're
I've
always
loved
my
son.
No,
no.
It's
changed
now.
You
see,
If
I
were
to
tell
it
would
shatter
I
know.

Can
you
imagine

to
have
someone
John
Kramer.

...and
tell
you

The
gravity
of
that?
That
the
clock's

In
a
split
second,

You
look
at
You
savor
everything,
The
clock
is
ticking,
John.
But
most
people
of
not
knowing
and
the
irony
of
it
is
It
keeps
them
sleepwalking.
It
keeps
them
You
can
still
Yeah,
but
can
we
fix
you?
Me?
I'm
not
fixable.
I've
got
cancer.
You're
using
No.
The
cancer
isn't
It
was
the
moment
I
that
started
me
in
my
work
and
brought
meaning
to
it.
Fuck!

I
had
literally
and
I
had
failed.

My
body
had
not
yet
I
had
lived
through

But,
to
my
amazement,

And
I
was
determined

testing
the
fabric
Do
you
understand,
Eric?
You
got
a
chance
Just
tell
me
I'll
help
you.
I
don't
need
your
help,
Those
who
don't
My
son
appreciates
But
do
you
appreciate
yours?
Oh,
this
is
shit!
Don't
forget
the
rules
if
you
wanna
Where
are
you?
No.
No,
we
don't
We
need
that
location
Hey.
I
don't
think
Laura,
can
you
hear
me?
That's
the
second
time
Think
you
can
stand
up?
Yeah,
but
I
don't
There's
so
much
So
many
people
This
can't
be
it.
It's
not.
Amanda,
you
said
you
This
guy,
you
said
that
Yeah.
So
that
means
Yeah.
Wait.
Amanda,
Because
I
was
And
the
funny
thing
is,
If
you
passed
his
test,

I
wasn't
being
How
long
have
you,
um...
I
started
in
jail.
What
were
you
But
I
thought
Maybe
you
should
talk
