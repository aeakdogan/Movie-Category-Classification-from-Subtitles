Isn't
that
what
you
wanted?
I
don't
want
to
be
afraid.
I
can

be
free
like
Please.
Help
me.
What
is
it
that
you
want?
Turn
us
both.
Let
us
leave.
And
I'll
show
you
a

the
past.
You

But,
Look.
We

It's

It's
about

And
besides...
what's
to
cure?
So
you
see,
Edward.
I
don't
need
you
anymore.
Of
course
you
couldn't
You're
weak.
The
truth
is:
You've
always
been
a
coward.
What
did
it
feel
like

Oh,
you
didn't
do
it,

you?
You
couldn't,

Mr.
Bromley.
Open
up.
Treated

That's
the

Welcome

Let's

Don't

this.
There's
a
cure.
Don't
do
this.
Run.
Ed.
They
can't
be
the

I
can't
let
you
do
it.
I'm
sorry.
We
have

cure.
We
can
change
you
back.
It's
not
too
