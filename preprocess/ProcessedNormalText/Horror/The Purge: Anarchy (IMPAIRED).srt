Yo,

some
heavy-duty
Purging.
Look
at

They're

You
were

You
reminded
me
of
someone.
Who?
Look,
Purging,
no
matter
Killing
doesn't
help
anything.
It
doesn't
heal
someone.
Enough.
Enough.
Go
back
with
your
mommy.
Go.

There's
no
air
in
here.

Come
over
here.
Put

won't
need
it.
Let's

the
food
is
delicious.
My
mother's
a
wonderful
cook.
My
sister's
a
testament
to
that.
What
the

does
that
mean?
TANYA:
That
she's
a
good
cook!
You
know,
you
didn't
have
to
go
this
far.
You
