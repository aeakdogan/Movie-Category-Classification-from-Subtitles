there
another
of
these
around?
Oh.
-
I
don't
see
it,
Hutch.
Hmm.
Oh,
probably
left
I'll
stop
back
there.
-
Definitely.
-
Good-bye.
-
Bye.
It
was
a
nice
surprise.
Guess
what
he
said.
-
What?
Oh,
good
old
Hutch.
I'm
gonna
get
a
paper,
honey.
-
He's
a
professional
crepe-hanger.
Then
he's
one
-



Hello?
Oh,
uh,
no.
I
think
she's
asleep.
Oh,
I
wouldn't...
Well,
she
could
be,
yeah.
All
right.
It's
Hutch.
Oh.
I
told
him
you
were
resting,
-
Hutch?
Well,
I-I
haven't
been
going
out.
Can
you
meet
me
tomorrow
morning
If
you
want
me
to.
-
What
is
it?
Can't
you
tell
me
now?
We
can
have
an
early
lunch,
if
you'd
like.
-
That
would
be
nice.
Okay.
No,
they
didn't
have
it.
-
Sleep
well.
-
What
was
that?
-
What
about?

I
think
those
boys'
adventure
Where
are
you
meeting
him?
Uh,
Time
and
Life
Building

This
is
ridiculous.
You're
pregnant...
I've
got
the
yens.
-
Yeah,
I'd
love
one.
-
Uh,
okay.



-
Hi!
-
so
I
won't
have
my
drink
at
11:00.
Take
it
later.

Pain,
begone.



-

Yes?
-
Yes.
Who
is
this,
please?
I
had
an
appointment
-
Hello?
-
"Taken
ill"?
He's
in
a
deep
coma
That's
awful.
I
just
spoke
to
him
I
spoke
to
him
at
11:00.
-
Who
is
this?
I'm
Grace
Cardiff,
Hutch's
friend.
And
do
they...
No,
they
don't
know
yet.
-
Oh,
my
God.
-
Is
there
anything
I
can
do?
All
right.
Um,
thank
you.
Now,
this
is
what
I
call

I
said
to
myself,
I
might
as
well
go
out
and
do
And
now
here
you
are
and
here
I
am.
Aw,
darlin',
what's
the
matter?
Aw.
Aw,

poor

You

I
think?

What
do
ya

Aw,
shoot.
There's
two
more

It'll

It's

me
Usually,
older

Oh,
you'll
make
it,
all
right.
Oh,
swell.
Do
you
really
think
it's
such
a
good
idea?
I
think
it's
the
best
idea
I've
had
in
months.
Don't
you
think
you
ought
to
check
What
for?
I'm
just
giving
a
party.
What
about
the
pain?
Oh,
haven't
you
heard?

We're
having
some

up

I'll

you

No.
Thank

It's
gonna
be
a

Oh.
I'll

Well,

I

tired.
Yeah,

for
the
understatement.
How
do
you
like
C.C.
Hill?
Mm-hmm.

But
I...
I'm
not
going
to
him.
I've
got
another
doctor

He's
just

Are
you

Yeah,
I'm

Hey,
let
me
in,
will
ya?

I
want
to
talk
to
Rosemary.
-
I
have
to
wash
these...
It
hurts
so
much.
When
did
the
pain
start?
In,
uh,
November.
-
November?
You
have
been
in
pain
since
November...
and
he's
not
doing
anything
to
help
you?
He
says
it's
gonna
stop.
-
Why
don't
you
go
to
see
another
doctor?
He
was
on
Open
End.
Well,
he
sounds
like
a
sadistic
nut.
Rosemary,
pain
like
that
is
a
warning...
that
something
isn't
right.
Go
see
Dr.
Hill.
-
Go
see
anybody
besides
that...
that...
-
You
can't
go
on
suffering
like
this.
Nobody's
telling
you
to
have
an
abortion.
Just
go
to
see
another
doctor,
that's
all.
The
thing
to
do
now
is
move.

Guy?
I'm
going
to
Dr.
Hill
Dr.
Sapirstein

don't
know...
out
of
his
mind.
Pain
like
this
is
a
warning
something's
wrong.

All
they
said
was,

a
second
opinion.
Rosemary,
you
got
the
best
doctor
in
New
York.
Do
you
know
who
Dr.
Hill
is?
I'm
tired
of
hearing
Well,
we'll
have
to
pay
Sapirstein,
It's
out
of
the
question.
No,
I'm
not
changing.
I
just
want
to
go
I
won't
let
you
do
it,
Ro.
I
mean,
because
it's,
uh...
it's
not
fair
to
Sapirstein.
"Not
fair
to"...
What
are
you
talking
about?
Look,
if
you
want
a
second
opinion...
You
tell
Sapirstein...
and-and-and
let
him
decide
No!
I
want
Dr.
Hill!
At
least
have
that
much
courtesy
Ro?
Rosemary?
What
is
it?

What?
The
pain
stopped.
-
"Stopped"?
What
was
in
that
drink
you
made?
Um,
eggs...
milk,
sug...
sugar.
What
else?
Rosemary,
for
chrissakes,
It's
alive!
Guy,
it's
moving.
It's
alive.
It's
all
right.

Feel.
Feel.
-
Don't
be
scared.
It
won't
bite
you.
I
feel
it
kicking.
It's
alive!
It's
moving!
I'll,
uh,
clean
up
some
of
this
mess.
Watch
the
walls,
now,
fellas.
Sort
of
in
the
center
there.

Thanks,

I

Oh,

I'm

hang
up

to
know

isn't.

5:00,

nice.

my...

regular,

saying.

was

Sapirstein?

isn't,

has

does...

ever
noticed?
No.

was

of
them.
All
of
them.
All
in
it
together.
All
of
them...
Don't
you
worry,
little
Andy
or
Jenny.
I'll
kill
them
before
I
let
them
touch
you.
-

-
Mrs.
Woodhouse?
Oh,
thank
you,
thank
you
for
calling
me.
-
I
thought
you
were
in
California.
No,
I've
been
to
another
doctor...
and
he
isn't
good,
Dr.
Hill.
He's
been
lying
to
me
and
giving
me...
unusual
kinds
of
drinks
and
capsules.
The
baby's
due
on
Tuesday.
-
Well,
I
want
you
to
deliver
it.
No,
please,
let
me...
Let
me
come
and
explain
what's
been
going
on.
I
can't
stay
too
long
here.
They'll
be
coming
looking
for
me.
Dr.
Hill?
I
know
that
sounds
crazy.
"My
God,
this
poor
girl
But
I
haven't
flipped,
Dr.
Hill.
I
swear
by
all
the
saints
I
haven't.
There
are
plots
against
people,
aren't
there?
Yes,
I
suppose
there
are.
Well,
there's
one
against
me
and
my
baby.
Come
to
my
office
tomorrow
Now.
Right
now.
Mrs.
Woodhouse,
I'm
not
-
I've
been
up
since
yesterday
morning...
I
beg
you.
I
can't
stay
here.
-
My
office
at
8:00.
-
All
right.
-
Yes?
I'm
not
gonna
speak
to
anyone.
Thank
you.
Keep
the
change.
Driver,
please,
could
you
wait
and
watch...
until
I'm
inside
the
door?
He
lied
to
you.
The
worst
thing
of
all...
He
sleeps
in
pajamas
now.
He's
probably
hiding
a
mark.
You
know,
they
give
you
marks
when
you
join.
All
sorts
of
rituals.
You
could
hear
them
singing
through
the
wall.
Guy...
my
husband,
Guy...
one
of
these
people,
playing
a
recorder.
Now,
how
did
he
know
it
was
Dr.
Shand
Uh,
they're
very
clever
people.
They
planned
everything
They
probably
made
some
sort
of
deal
with
Guy.
They
gave
him
success,
and
he
promised
them...
our
baby
to
use
in
their
rituals.
I
know
this
sounds
crazy,
but
I've...
Look.
There
was
another
actor
like
him,
and
they
put
a
spell
on
him.
They
cast
a
spell
on
him
and
made
him
blind...
so
that
Guy
could
get
his
part.
Look.
Here.
I
had
this
friend,
Edward
Hutchins.
A
writer.
Anyway,
he
was
my
good
friend
-
May
I
keep
this?
And,
uh,
anyway...
once
Mr.
Hutchins
came
to
visit
me.
Came
to
visit
me.
It
was
the
time
I
was
suffering
so...
You
can't
imagine
And
they
wouldn't
help
me.
They
were
giving
me
a
drink
also
witches'
stuff,
tannis
root.
Hutch
came,
and
he
immediately
He
knew
about
witches,
you
see?
Suddenly,
Guy
rushed
in
with
his
makeup
They
probably
called
him
to
come
home...
and
steal
one
of
Hutch's
belongings,
Took
his
glove.
Put
him
in
a
coma.
Now,
maybe
all
this
is
coincidence,
They
have
a
coven,
and
they
want
my
baby.
It
certainly
seems
that
way.
I
was
afraid
you
wouldn't
believe
me.
I
don't
believe
in
witchcraft...
but
there're
plenty
of
maniacs
The
doctor's
name
is
Shand,
you
say?
No,
Dr.
Shand
The
doctor's
name
is
Sapirstein.
Abraham
Sapirstein?
Yeah.
-
Do
you
know
him?
To
look
at
him,
you'd
never
think
he...
No,
you
wouldn't.
Would
you
like
to
go
into
Mount
Sinai
right
now?
This
evening?
Yeah,
I
would
love
to.
It's
difficult.
We'll
try.
I
want
you
to
lie
down
and
get
some
rest.
Thanks.
Anything
they've
got.
I
hope
we
can
do
better
than
that.
I'll
see
what
I
can
do,
Should
I
undress
now?
No,
it'll
take
me
about
You
just
lie
down.
Rest.
-
Okay?
God
bless
Dr.
Hill.
Everything's
gonna
be
okay
now,
Andy
or
Jenny.
We're
gonna
be
in
a
nice,
clean
hospital...
with
no
visitors.
Oh.
Monsters.
Unspeakable!


I
was
sleeping.
Come
with
us
quietly,
Rosemary.
Don't
argue
or
make
a
scene...
because
if
you
say
anything
more
we're
gonna
be
forced
You
don't
want
that,
do
you?
We
just
want
to
take
you
home.
Or
the
baby.
She's
fine
now.
-
We're
going
to
go
home
and
rest.
-
Thank
you
for
your
trouble,
Doctor.
It's
a
shame
you
had
to
come
in
here.
Good
evening,
Mrs.
Woodhouse.
Mrs.
Woodhouse!


-
Ro!
Ro!
Ro!
Oh,
Ro,
baby.
Ro!
Ro!
-
Come
on.
Open
up,
Ro.
-
Come
on,
honey.
I
didn't
promise
them
anything.
-

Rosemary...

-

Hello?
-
Mrs.
Dunstan
is
out.
-
The
babysitter.
-
They
went
to
the
movies.
Please
ask
her
to
call
Rosemary
It's
terribly
urgent.
-
Don't
forget,
hmm?
Thank
you.

We
don't
want
We're
your
friends,
Rosemary.
There's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of,
Rosemary.
This
is
nothing
but
a
mild
sedative
You
know
I
wouldn't
let
anyone...
-
Ro!
Ro!
-
Ro!
Ro!
-
Oh,
Ro,
baby.
Stop.
Ro!

Wait
a
minute!
-
We
happen
to
be
in
labor
here.
-
Here.
-
You're
gonna
be
perfectly
all
right.
-
It
was
supposed
to
be
Doctors
Hospital!
-
Doctors
Hospital,
with
nurses...
-
And
everything
clean
and
sterile!
Hello?
No,
she
isn't
here,
Elise.

Oh,
Andy...
Andy
or
Jenny...
I'm
sorry,
my
little
darling.
Forgive
me!
Hi.
Is
it
all
right?
Yes.
It's
fine.
What
is
it?
A
boy.
Really?
A
boy?
And
it's
all
right?
Yes.
-
Where
is
it?
Oh,
my
goodness!
Oh,
dear,
what
a
start
you
gave
me!
The
baby...
where
is
it?
Oh,
uh,
you-you
wait
here
Where's
my
baby?
I'll
go
find
Dr.
Abe.
Where's
the
baby?
Where
is
it?
Honey...
There
were
complications,
Rosemary,
It's...
Dead.
In
a
hospital,
I
might've
been
able

Honey,
we
can
have
others

Absolutely.
You
can
-

As
soon
as
you're
better.
I
don't
believe
you.
-
Honey.
Honey...
You
took
it!
You're
lying!
You
witches,
you're
lying!
You're
lying!
You're
lying!
You're
lying!
Abe
says
it's
called...
prepartum.
I
don't
know.
Boy,
you
were
really
-
kapow!...
Uh...
Yeah,
I
know
where
that
Minnie
and
Roman
were
witches...
But
how
come
you
thought
Um...
Let's
face
it,
darling.
prepartum
crazies.
And
now
you're
gonna
rest,
I
know
this
is
the
worst
thing
but
from
now
on,
everything's
gonna
be
roses.
Paramount's
within
an
inch
and
suddenly
Universal's
interested
too.
And
we're
gonna
blow
this
town,
and
we're
with
a
pool
and
a
spice
garden...
And
the
kids
too,
Ro.
You
heard
what
Abe
said.
Well,
I
got
to
run
now
and
get
famous.
Let
me
see
your
shoulder.
-
Let
me
see
your
shoulder.
Your
left
shoulder.
All
right.
Anything
you
say.
I
generally
prefer
doing
this
to
music.
Left
shoulder.
Right
shoulder.
And
that's
as
far
as
I
go
without
a
blue
light.
The
high-pressure
area
-
has
been
causing
this
extreme
And
unfortunately
will
be
staying
through
the
rest
of
the
week.
It
will
be
hot
and
overcast
with
the
possibility
of
thunder
showers
-

All
you
people
leaving
the
city
-



Do
you
hear
a
baby
crying?
Why,
no,
I
don't,
dear.
Now,
you
come
and
get
into
your
bed
now.
It's
time
for
you
to
take
your
pill.
-
Did
you
turn
the
air
conditioner
off?
You
mustn't
do
that,
dear.
Why,
people
are
actually
dying,
it's
so
hot.
What
do
you
do
with
the
milk?
Why,
uh,
throw
it
away.
Oh.
Your
pill,
Rosemary.
Hello,
girls.
Whew!
Ninety-five
out.
Some
new
people
moved
on
in
up
on
eight.
Do
they
have
a
baby?
How'd
you
know
that?
I
heard
it
crying.
Oh,
wait
a
minute.
-
Oh!
No.
Don't
do
that.
Uh...
a
little
messy,
that's
all.





"You've
got
her
too
high."

Not
if
he's
still
waiting
-


Ah,
hell,
now,
Hayato,
You're
pullin'
my
leg,
like
we
say
over
here.


Rosemary,
go
back
to
bed.
You
know
you're
not
supposed
-
Is
the
mother?
-
Shut
up!
Shut
up.
You're
in
Dubrovnik.
What
have
you
done
to
it?
What
have
you
done
to
its
eyes?
He
has
his
father's
eyes.
What
are
you
talking
about?
What
have
you
done
to
him,
you
maniacs?
Satan
is
his
father,
not
Guy.
He
came
up
from
hell
-
Hail,
Satan!
Satan
is
his
father,
and
his
name
is
Adrian.
He
shall
overthrow
the
mighty
He
shall
redeem
the
despised...
and
wreak
vengeance...
in
the
name
of
the
burned
and
the
tortured!
-
Hail,
Adrian!
-
No!
No!
-
Hail,
Satan!
Out
of
all
the
women
He
arranged
things
'cause
he
wanted
you
-
His
power
is
stronger
than
stronger.
-
His
might
shall
last
longer
than
longer.
No!
It
can't
be!
-
No!
And
his
feet.
Oh,
God!
-
God
is
dead!
Satan
lives!
-
Hail,
Satan!
-
The
year
is
One!

Why
don't
you
help
us
out,
Rosemary?
Be
a
real
mother
to
Adrian.
Just
be
a
mother
to
your
baby.
Minnie
and
Laura-Louise
are
too
old.
-
It's
not
right.
Think
about
it,
Rosemary.
Oh,
God!
Oh,
shut
up
with
your
"Oh,
Gods,"
You
shut
up.
so
you
show
some
respect.

Come,
my
friend.
Come
see
the
child.
-

What
would
you
like
to
drink?
They,
uh,
promised
me
you
wouldn't
be
hurt...
and
you
haven't
been,
really.
I
mean,
supposing
Wouldn't
that
be
the
same?
And
we're
getting
so
much
in
return,
Ro.
Oh,
Guy,
let
me
introduce
you
How
proud
you
must
be!
-
Why
in
the
name...
What's
in
it?
Tannis
root?
Nothin's
in
it.
Just
plain,
ordinary


Get
away
from
here!
Roman!
You're
rocking
him
too
fast.
Sit
down!
Get
her
out
of
here.
You're
rocking
him
too
fast.
-
Mind
your
own
business!
Go
on.
Sit
down
with
the
others.
-
Why,
she's
liable
to...

Rock
him.
You're
trying
to
get
me
to
be
his
mother.
Aren't
you
his
mother?
