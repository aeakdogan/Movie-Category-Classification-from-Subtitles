MINA:
Diary,
30th
of
May,
I
know
that
Jonathan
does
not
want
me
to
He
thinks
that
if
I
to
the
wealth
and
privileges
I
will
not
be
content
as
the
wife
But
Lucy
and
I
have
been
friends
And
she
has
never
minded
Oh,
how
disgustingly
awful.

LUCY:
Mina.

Oh,
Mina,
Is
your
ambitious
John
Harker
forcing
you
to
learn
When
he
could
be
unspeakable
acts
of
desperate
Lucy,
really.
You
shouldn't
talk
There's
more
to
marriage
Oh,
Mina.
So
I
see.

Oh.
Oh,
that's--
What
is
it,
Lucy?
Oh,
Mina.
Can
man
and
woman
I
did.
Only
last
night.
Yes,
I
did.
Jonathan
measures
up,
We've
kissed,
that's
all.
He
thinks
he's
too
poor
It's
all
the
worse
now
that
I'm
here
my
rich
friend.
Yes,
but
not
even
one
And
here
I
am,
almost
20.
Practically
a

I
admit
that

defect
