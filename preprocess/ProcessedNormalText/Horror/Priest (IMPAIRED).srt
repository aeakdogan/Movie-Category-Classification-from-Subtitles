was
just
a
baby
You're
lying.
I
knew
Owen.
The
child
needed
a
father.
We
all
made
sacrifices.
Hicks,
if
you
do
this,
it
won't
matter
You
won't
stop
the
train,
and
You
won't
save
her.
We
ride
out
When
the
time
comes,
you
blow
the
What
if
you're
still
Good
luck.
Focus.

Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Hello,
my
friend.
You
fell!
No!
In
the
depths
of
that
hive,
I
crossed
the
threshold
And
do
you
know
what
I
found?
The
Queen
we
had
come
to
kill,
she
turned
me
into
something
that
a
human
vampire.
Join
me.
Accept
the
blood
of
the
Queen,
and
together,
we
can
return
Where's
my
daughter?
Waiting
for
your
decision.

You
can't
win.
I'm
stronger
now





This
is
your
The
Queen's
hands
Mankind
will
find
no
quarter
Join
me,
and
your
life
of
Never.


Shit.
LUCY:
Hicks!
Lucy!
Shit.
Did
you
find
her?
I
couldn't
get
close.
You
would
have
made
Thanks.
Don't
let
it
go
to
your
head.
Hicks!
No!

Stop
it!
No!
No,
Lucy!
Very
good.
Just
like
your
father.
He
never
told
you.

Burn.
In
this
time
of
need,
You
are
my
refuge
and
strength.
I
do
not
fear,


I
won't
let
you
go!
Your
faith
has
failed
you.

No!





"For
the
life
of
the
flesh
"and
I
have
given
it
"to
make
an
atonement

How
dare
you
come
back
A
man
who
would
defy
the
Church

Look
inside
the
burning
train
you'll
find
hundreds
and
their
Queen
Lies!
This
man
is
a
charlatan.
A
risk
to
the
security
There
is
no
vampire
menace.
The
war
is
over,
Priest!
No,
it's
just
beginning.
I've
notified
the
others.
We'll
meet
you
at
the
Godspeed.
