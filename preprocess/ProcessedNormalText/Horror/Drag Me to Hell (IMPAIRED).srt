We

That's
not

you

that

No,

you

Thank
you
very
much.
You

I
think
I
will
try

gonna
like
it.
You
only
dislike

LEONARD:
Well,
that
counts
us
out.
TRUDY:
Lovely.
LEONARD:
Thank
you,
Christine.
CLAY:
It
also
changed
the
subject
nicely.
Thank
you.
That
looks
good!
LEONARD:
Harvest
cake,
huh?
LEONARD:
We'll
have
to
get
this

Did
you
hear
something?
No.
You
okay?
TRUDY:
Tasty!
-I
like
it
a
lot.

to
meet
CLAY:
Well,
you
also
have
a
thing
about
bars.

Would
you,
Christine?
-No.
No,
of
course
not.
We
met
at
a
bar,
Chris.
-Oh,
my
God,
that's
right!
-You
two
better
get
your
stories
straight.
Yeah,
we
met...
We
met
at

okay?
You
okay?
Some
water?
Baby,

some...
Oh,
my
God!
I'm
sorry,
I

Okay,
I
hear
you!

I'd
better
go.

Wait,
Chris...

she
needs

RHAM
JAS:
Wait!
What's
the
matter?
Look,
I
did
what
you
said!
You're
so
full
of
shit!
These
are
elusive
and
powerful
forces
There
are
no
guarantees.
We
must
speak
directly
to
this
dark
spirit.
We
must
dissuade
it
from

know
someone
who
can
help
us.
Tomorrow
is
the
third
day.
We
can't
let
that
happen.

can
help
us

not
do
that

free.
$10,000
cash
by
tomorrow.
-Mr
Jacks.
This
is
kind
of
awkward
for
me,
but
I
was
wondering
if
I
could
get
What,
the
assistant
manager's
position?
Yes.
See,
one
of
my
family
-They're
not
gonna
die,
but
they
could.
There's
a
problem.
-What?
Right
after
I
informed
the
regional
office
I
find
out
that
they
just
made
Now,
I
gotta
call
in
to
see
but
right
now,
this
does
not
So,
this
assistant
manager
In
fact,
you
know,
I
think,
with
I
think
I'm
gonna
have
Stu.
I
see.
I'm
sorry.
maybe
you
should
take
the
day
off,


-So,
how
much?
-Including
my
jewellery?
But
this
stuff
is
worth
Please.
This
is
all
I
have.
I'm
begging
you.
Take
it
or
leave
it.

CLAY:
Chris?
Chris?
Baby?
I
thought
you
were
lactose
intolerant.
I
am.
But
then
I
thought,
I
paid
Rham
Jas.
What?
You're
kidding
me.
I
paid
him.
Why?
I
mean,
I
thought
I
don't
know
what
I
believe
in
any
more.
I
really
don't,
I
know
how
important
it
is
to
you,
and
I
know
how
much
pain
And,
I
also
remembered...
I
remembered
a
promise
that
I
made
the
night
I
fell
in
love
with
you.
I
told
myself
that
I
would...
I
would
always
look
out
for
you.
So
I
paid
him.
You
remember
the
night
I
remember
the
second
Oh,
my
God.
You
sure
you
don't
He
said
I
should
come
alone.
Yeah,
I
know,
I
know
he
did.
Christine,
if
you
will
permit
me
the
pleasure
of
an
introduction,
-Welcome.
Shaun
San
Dena
is
an
experienced
medium.
Furthermore,
she's
personally
I
first
encountered
this
spirit
And
what
happened?
I
lost
a
young
boy's
soul
to
the
beast.
I
have
waited
these
long
years
for
a
chance
at
redeeming
myself,
a
chance
to
destroy
the
foul
thing.
-And...
Tonight,
my
chance
will
come.
But
to
summon
it,
I
will
need
your
help.
Can
you
be
strong?
I'll
try.
My
late
husband,
Sandor,
He
chose
this
site
to
build
a
house
upon
because
he
sensed
In
this
place,
there
is
a
particular...

A
particular
confluence
of
forces
which
allows
a
doorway
to
be
opened

...and
through
which
others
Please
be
seated.

What's
going
on?
Everything
we're
doing
is
for
your
Thank
you.

Once
the
spirit
has
entered
me,
-Do
you
understand?
I
force
the
spirit
of
the
Lamia
into
the
goat.

MILOS:
I
understand.
We
all
must
be
receptive.

-What
am
I
supposed
to
do?
You
must
invite
the
dead
-I'm
scared.
Now
repeat
these
words,
-I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
-I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
-I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
I
welcome
the
dead...

I
welcome
the
dead
into
my
soul.
I
welcome
the
dead
into...
Something
else
is
here
with
us.
Yes.


This
is
not
the
Lamia.
It
is
the
spirit
of
some
unsettled
soul
from
years
ago.
Sometimes
the
unsettled
SHAUN
SAN
DENA:
Begone,
foolish
spirits!
Begone!
She
is
coming.







Who
now
inhabits
the
Lamia!
Lamia,
what
is
it
you
desire?
I
desire
the
soul
of
Christine
Brown!
We
will
feast
upon
it
No!
It
was
my
manager,
Jim
Jacks!
-He
was
the
one!
He
was...
Lamia,
surely
you
can
be
dissuaded
Surely
she
is
not
worthy
of
your
greatness.

No!
I
come
for
you,
Christine.
You're
mine!

No!
You
tricked
me!
You
black-hearted
whore!
-Now,
Milos,
now!


Away,
unclean
spirit.

Lamia!
As
one
who
summoned
you
to
this
circle,

Christine!
I
don't
want
your
cat,
you
dirty
pork
queen!
Shaun
San
Dena!
You
must
banish
the
spirit!
Yes!

Milos!
-Oh,
my
God.
I'm
okay.
-I'm
okay.
-You
did
it!
I
tried.
Are
you
okay?
Oh,
my
God.
Help
me!
Call
an
ambulance.
Is
she
breathing?
No.
Oh,
my
gosh.
-It's
so
sad.
Strange
how
things
work
out.
She
waited
40
years
for
another
and
finally,
on
the
last
No,
I'm
afraid
you
misunderstand.
The
Lamia
cannot
be
banished
by
a
medium.
This
is
our
lesson
tonight.
I'm
sorry.
-But
I
saw
her
get
rid
of
the
thing.
You
saw
her
drive
it
from
a
sance.
It
will
be
back.
When
this
night
is
through,
the
Lamia
will
come
for
the
owner
Unless,
of
course,
you
are
no
longer
Make
a
gift
of
it
and
Why
didn't
you
tell
me
this
before?
Because
the
Lamia
will
tear
the
soul
They'll
burn
in
hell
for
eternity.
And
I
would
have
sent
them
there.
And
I
would
be
your
accomplice.
Whatever
you
decide,
you
have
till
morning.
Is
it
over?
It's
over.
Clay!
You
will
burn
in
hell!
You
will
burn
in
hell!
Your
turn's
coming!
-You
will
burn
in
hell!
Holy
shit.

Okay,
you
sure
you're
still
okay
-Yeah,
I'm
fine.
-And
what
time
should
I
get
you?
There's
something
I've
gotta
do
on
the
way.
I
can
do
it.
You
want
me
No!
No.
I've
got
it
under
control.
We'll
meet
at,
like,
7:30
at
the...
-What
envelope?
-It's
just
an
envelope.
It's
here,
so
we'll
find
it
eventually.
-Oh,
my
God.
I
thought
I'd
lost
it.
Okay.
Bye.
7:30.
Don't
be
late.
BOY:
Dad,
can
we
go
to
the
Angel
game?
-What
about
the
Dodgers?
I'm
sure
if
I
just
tell
him
I
mean,
he's
gotta
understand.
WAITRESS:
Are
you
sure
No.
WAITRESS:
So
you're
just
gonna
Yes.
Maybe!
What's
it
to
you?
Honey,
I
make
my
money
on
tips.
Honey,
just
keep
the
coffee
coming
Oh,
my
gosh.
What
a
delightful
surprise.
You're
the
sweetest
person
in
the
world.
Never
mind
what
it's
about,
Stu.
Just
get
here
in
10
minutes
something
you
don't
want
me
to
tell
him.
STU:
Oh,
yeah?
Like
what?
Well,
for
starters,
that
you
stole
and
gave
it
to
First
National.
-Give
me
another.
Oh,
God,
Christine,
please
don't
tell
on
me.
-Just
tell
me
what
you
want.
-A
little
gift.
But
I
don't
understand.
because
I
gave
that
loan
to
First
National...
Look,
you
don't
need
to
understand.
Now,
this
gift
that
I'm
giving
you,
You'll
be
the
owner,
all
right?
Okay.

Okay.
What?
Forget
it.
But
I
thought
you
wanted
to
give
it
to
me
Just
leave.
Okay.
Thank
you
so
much,
Christine.
-But
you're
not
gonna
tell
my
dad,
right?
Okay.
Who
does
deserve
this?
Well?
Is
it
possible?
There
are
gypsy
blessings
They
give
gifts
to
their
departed
to
curry
favour
with
the
deceased's
soul,
Yes.
I
do
believe
you
can
give
the
curse
but
you
must
make
a
formal
gift
I'll
do
better
than
that.
I'm
gonna
get
some...



I'm
giving
it
back
to
you!
You're
gonna
take
this
thing.
Are
you
gonna
take
this
thing?
Take
it!
That's
the
last
of
my
hair
you're
getting!
I,
Christine
Brown,
to
you,
Sylvia
Ganush!
Choke
on
it,
bitch!
Goodbye.

tried

he

And

God,
I'm
so
glad
you're
here.
Wait,
there's
something
I
wanna
say
-while
I
have
it
straight
in
my
head.
You
never
stopped
believing
in
me.
Thank
you
for
that.
And
there's
something
else,
I
could
have
given
Mrs
Ganush
It
was
my
decision,
and
it
was
wrong

me.
You
have
such
a
good
heart.
You're
so
beautiful
right
now.

you
like

-What
happened

-And
I
never
want
to
see
it
again.
That's
too
bad,
because
I...
Look
I
thought...
And
I
thought
maybe
you
could...
I
thought
maybe
you
could
sew
it
back
on.
And
I
think
you
might
have
'cause
the
envelopes
kind
of
look
the
