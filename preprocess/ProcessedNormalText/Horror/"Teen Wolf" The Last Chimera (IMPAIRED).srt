What
are
they?
STILINSKI:
There's
a
dead
girl.
You
know
it
wasn't
Kira.
My
daughter's
still
alive.
I'm
just
going
to
have
to
kill
her
again.
I'm
here
for
a

You
gotta
give
her
the

Success...
Imminent.

DR.
VALACK:
Tell
me
where
you
are,
Lydia.
Tell
me
what
you
see.
LYDIA:

VALACK:
Keep
moving.
Describe
what
you
find.
Tell
me
what
he
did.

What
did
you
do
to
me?
DR.
VALACK:
I've
amplified
your
abilities.
Something

Now
focus
on
the
bridge...
On
Theo.
Why
did
he
let
his
sister
die?
-
I
don't
know.
Search
for
it,
Lydia.
Keep
looking.
Why
did
he
let
her
die?
What
did
he
want?


LYDIA:
Her
heart.

He
wanted

to

Why
do
you

Because
Theo
was

in

Think
of
who

are.
Para
scientists
who
have

twisted

of

And
now
they've
done
it.
But
Theo
doesn't

who

The

Chimera.
It
doesn't

There's
a
reason
they

him,
a

failed,
a

and
a
reason
they

succeeded.
It
all
starts

Theo.

That

Doctors
had

LYDIA:
Scott
and
Stiles
DR.
VALACK:
The
night
of
the
Super
moon.
LYDIA:
But
they
really
didn't
know
it
yet.
There
was
too
much
going
on.

Liam
had
almost
killed
Scott.

Kira
was
still
gone.
Malia
was
trying
to
find
The
Desert
Wolf.
You
were
missing.
And
Sheriff
Stilinski
was
dying...
DR.
GEYER:
All
right,
we've
got

Where's
my
son?
We're
taking
care
of
you,
Sheriff,
but
Contact
the
blood

and
type
and

Where's
my
son?
Where's
Stiles?
NURSE:
Stilinski,
right?
You
said
his
insurance
was
No,
he's
the
sheriff,
he's
the
county
sheriff.
Okay.
He's
covered.
I
mean
he
should
be
covered.
-

I
texted
Scott.
He's
coming
as
soon
as
he
can.
-
I
can
call
Malia.
Don't,
don't
call
anyone.
NURSE:
Is
there
anyone
A
next
of
kin?
No,
it's
me.
It's
just
me.






PARRISH:
What's
happening?
You're
a
harbinger
of
death,
Jordan.
Don't
you
know?
Know
what?
Someone's
dying.



-
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
can't
say
how
I
know,
Parrish,
you're
missing.
And
some
people
here
are
really
I
know
and
I'm
going
to
try
to
explain
it.
But
I
need
you
to
find
Parrish,
no
one's
available.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what's
going
on?
The
high
school
sign
somehow
The
library
is
completely
wrecked.
There
might
be
a
prehistoric
animal
running
around
the
streets,
and
I
am
starting
to
seriously
Okay,
listen.
I
promise
I'm
But,
right
now,
I've
got
to
find
Lydia.
-
Parrish.


Lydia!
Lydia!
STILINSKI:
Stiles,
you
need
to
get
up.
-
You
gotta
get
up
now.
He's
okay.
Dr.
Geyer
is
stitching
him
up
right
now.
-
Okay,
I
wanna
see
him.
The
anesthesia
needs
to
wear
off.
Okay,
yeah,
but
everything's
gonna
Mmm.
He's
gonna
be
just
fine.

Oh,
thank
God.
PARRISH:
Scott,
wake
up.
Scott.
Are
you
all
right?
Yeah.
-
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
It's
not
that
bad.
Why
are
you
here?
-
I
need
your
help.
With
her.
PARRISH:
I
found
her
out
in
the
woods...
Her
body
was
freezing.

She
was
practically
hyperthermic.
But
that
wasn't
even
the
worst
part.
It's
a
badge.
A
sheriff's
badge.
No.
It's
a
warning.


What
do
you
think
you're
doing?


Someone's
got
No.
Somebody
doesn't
have
to
be
you.
All
right,
especially
looking
like
this.
I
mean,
what
if
they
think
you
killed
her?

Maybe
I
did.
You
didn't.
And
while
the
last
few
hours
This
isn't
the
way
to
fix
it.
She's
going
to
find
out,
and
it's
not
gonna
hurt

What?

It's
Hayden.
It's
her
scent.

She's
here.
You
held
her
body
in
your
arms.
You...
you
watched
Parrish
She's...
she's
gone...
It
was
her.
It's
where
it
was.
Hey,
come
on.
Let's
go.
Let's
go.

Help!
Get
someone
to
help
me.
Quick.
I
need
help.
I've
got
an
18-year-old

STILES:
What
do
you
mean
you
don't
know?
Two
hours
ago,
he
was
fine.
Now
it
looks
like
somebody
There
could've
been
some
minor
internal.
Did
you
say,
"Minor
internal?"
-
Since
when
is
anything
internal
minor?
MELISSA:
Stiles...
STILES:
I
need
to
know
what's
Dr.
Geyer,
somebody
needs
Somebody
needs
to
tell
me
We
don't
know.

-

Where
were
you?
You
trusted
-
Right,
huh?
So,
where
were
you?
Where
the
hell
were
you?
-
Stop
it!

Okay,
all
right,
all
right.

Your
dad's
not
the
only
one
who
got
hurt.
Oh,
you'll
heal.
I'm
not
talking
about
me.
NATALIE:
Everything's
going
We're
going
to
get
you
The
best
doctors.
The
best
everything.
No.
No,
you
don't.
You're
not
coming
in
here.
Get
out!
Just
wait,
wait.
I
think
I
just
need
to
look
at
I
know
who
did
this.
You.
All
of
you!
Get
out!
Come
on,
please.
You
-
You
just
gotta
check
the
back...
-
Just
check
the
back
of
her
neck.

Oh,
God.

I
told
you
to
stay
in
the
car.
I
told
you
to
stay
in
the
car.
It
could
be
a
side
effect
of
shock.
She's
catatonic.
It
was
Theo
digging
his
Why
would
he
do
that?
The
same
thing
he's
always
So
what
did
he
gain
by
It
left
me
alone
with
Liam.
Theo
wanted
to
make
sure
no
one
would
Okay,
so
he
gutted
my
dad
as
a
distraction.
We
need
to
find
this
kid.
Isn't
that
a
little
dangerous?
Yeah,
but
he
said
he
And
you
believe
him?
He
told
me
where
to
find
him.
So,
maybe
he
also
knows
how
to
save
him.
What
do
you
want
to
do?
Talk
to
him?
If
it
saves
my
dad,
then
yeah.
I'll
come
with
you.
He
Maybe
that
gives
us
an
advantage.
He'll
know
you're
there.
I
just
need
to
talk
to
him.
Not
fight
him.
Stiles,
you
can't
go
alone.
Does
anyone
even
know
how
to
find
him?
STILES:
We
don't
have
to
find
him.
He'll
come
to
me.
DR.
FENRIS:
She'll
be
well
It's
a
very
different
place
now.
She'll
be
safe
there.

She'll
be
safe.

Just
two
signatures,
Ms.
Martin.
PARRISH:
Ms.
Martin!
I
promise
I'll
look
after
her
personally.
-
Ms.
Martin
Okay.
Ms.
Martin.
Ms.
Martin,
who
was
that?
What
were
you
signing?
She'll
be
safe
there.
What
do
you
mean?
What
did
you
do?
I
did
what
I
had
to.
I
guess
we're
all
telling
the
truth
now.
You
killed
my
best
friend?
Let's
be
honest,
Stiles.
Was
he
still
really
your
best
friend?
Are
you
going
to
let
my
father
die?
If
I
wanted
him
to
die
I
wouldn't
Then
why
are
they
saying
That
some
toxin's
poisoning
him
I'm
not
the
bad
guy,
Stiles.
I'm
just
a
realist.
I'm
a
survivor.
If
you
knew
Yeah,
but
what
do
you
know?
I
know
what's
coming.
I
know
what
the
Dread
Doctors
created.
And
I
know
what
Parrish
is.
No,
there
have
not
been
any
other
No
one
named
Hayden?
Mason,
take
him
home.
It's
6:00
in
the
morning.
Dad,
you're
sure
there
have
Both
of
you.
Home.
Now.


We're
not
going
home,
are
we?
No.
Well,
we
both
know
where
Hayden's
body
is.
And
if
you
want
to
find
find
the
Nemeton.
Okay.
Let's
find
the
Nemeton.

I
need
to
learn
to
shut
up.
THEO:
Lydia
figured
it
out.
I
saw
it
in
her
memories.
Right
after
you
drove
her
out
of
her
mind.
Collateral
damage.
But
if
she's
right
about
Parrish,
then
things
around
here
-
I
don't
care.
Because
if
your
dad
does
sheriff
of
anything
much
longer.
What's
happening
to
him?
Hey,
tell
me!
STILINSKI:
Stiles,
you
need
to
get
up.
You
gotta
get
up
now.
Stiles.
Stiles.
-
Are
you
okay?
Are
you
hurt?

-
You
blacked
out.
Did
you
get
anything
from
him?
Nothing.
He
was
calm
the
entire
time.
What
about
his
heart?
I
heard
it
jump,
but
only
That
doesn't
mean
he
was
lying.
Not
really.
The
rest
of
the
time
it
was
steady.
When
did
it
jump?
What
was
I
talking
about?
It
was
when
you
said
that
That
could
be
something.
A
jump
could
mean
surprise,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
I
think
so.
So
why
would
he
be
surprised
Oh,
wait.
He
didn't
say
that
he
was
the
No.
Well,
then
this
means
it
Another
Chimera.


Chimera...
-
Stiles?
You
don't
even
know
where
to
start.

All
we
know
-
Do
you
even
know
where
you're
headed?
Come
on.
Let
me
help.
I
can

You
can't
do
this
alone,
okay.
You
need
me.
You
need
all
of
us.
I
can
get
more
help.
I
can
text
Liam.
Liam
just
tried
to
kill
you.
Okay,
then
at
least
let
me
help.
You
believed
him?
You
trusted
him,
too.
Theo
got
to
all
of
us.
You
know,
you
don't
SCOTT:
I
don't
need
to.
All
that
matters
right
now
is
your
dad.
Come
on,
Stiles.
We
survived
an
Alpha
pack,
a
Dark
Druid,
professional
assassins.
We
can
survive
Dread
We're
not
looking
for
a
missing
Chimera.
We're
looking
for
a
missing
teenager.





SCOTT:
Liam!
MASON:
Liam.
All
right.
This
is
the
one.
You
see
these.
These
are
Ley
Lines.
They're
mapped
according
Stiles
said
that
he
and
Lydia
Probably...
This
one.
But
they
never
found
it.
They
kept
going
out
there
to
look,
but
they
said
the
Nemeton
It's
a
supernatural
tree
in
order
for
you
to
see
it?
Yeah.
That's
awesome.
We
should
just
make
a
copy...


I'm
going
to
find
a
way
Even
if
I
have
to
break
through
the
walls.
Good
luck
with
that
Deputy.
She's
a
pretty
little
thing,
isn't
she?
That
pretty
little
thing
could
if
someone
decided
to
teach
her
how.
There
was
a
call
a
few
from
Beacon
High
who
-
What's
his
name?

Now
we
can
catch
his
scent.
-
You
called
her.
I
should
be
calling
everyone.
And
I
know
what
this
kid
looks
like.




-
MASON:
This
is
it.
Maybe
the
clearing
doesn't

I
couldn't
save
her.
No
one
could.
I
was
standing
right
there.

Melissa
did
everything
While
I
was
trying
to
kill
Scott.
You
can't
take
all
the
blame.
I
mean,
there
was,
like,
800
extenuating
circumstances.
It
wasn't
just
the
moon.
Then
it
was
losing
Hayden.

In
fear,
anger,
and
Theo
took
advantage
of
it.
Or
maybe
it
was
just
me.
Liam,
you're
a
werewolf.
There
was
a
full
moon,
a
Super
moon.
And
you
can't
let
yourself...
What?
The
Nemeton's
a
beacon
for
Yeah.
So
what
if
it
takes
a
I
am
a
supernatural
creature
But
you've
been
looking

-
Mason...
Look.
I
don't
see
any...
Intense.

MALIA:
He
didn't
want
No.
Is
it
that
bad?
We
kind
of
broke
up,
I
guess.
Yeah,
we
kind
of
broke
up,
too.
Hey,
you
can
tell
me
I
mean
besides
Stiles.
You
can
talk
to
me.
I
said
I'd
help
find
this
kid
and
I'm
doing
it
to
save
Stiles'
dad.
Don't
ask
me
to
talk.
Well,
I'm
not
asking.
I'm
offering.
I'm
just
saying
it's
okay
if
you
want
to.
I
know.
I
got
it.
I
got
his
scent.
Melissa,
that
man
in
there
is
dying
and
I
don't
know
how
to
save
him.
I
went
to
Harvard
Med.
I
have
degrees
lining
And
I
don't
have
the
slightest
If
you
know
something
-
Me?
Nothing
seems
to
faze
you.
And
not
to
sound
accusatory,
but
it's
like
you
know
something.
Knowing
something
is
different
Yeah,
I
could
tell
you
But
right
now
I
can't
tell
you
anything
that
is
gonna
save
his
life.
Then
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
Keep
him
alive.
For
as
long
as
we
can.
LIAM:
There's
only
four
here.
That
means
four
Chimeras
are
missing.
I
only
care
about
one.
Hayden's
alive.
She
has
to
be.
MASON:
Okay,
maybe
you're
right.
Either
way,
we
gotta
We
get
the
cops
down
here
and
they
can
figure
out
who's
dead,
Sound
good?
POLICEMAN:
You
two.

HAYDEN:
That's
it.
That's
Four
of
them.
This
is
Noah's.
He
was
here.
I
think
he's
close.
SCOTT:
Guys...
I
think
we've
been
down
like
when
we
were
trying
STILES:
Okay,
so
what?
Maybe,
it
means
we're
closer
than
we
think.
Maybe
there's
something
else
down
here.
Something
that
we
haven't
found
yet.
Yeah,
nothing
that
helps
my
dad.
Look,
we
can't
just
be
standing

SCOTT:
Stiles.
STILINSKI:
Stiles,
you
need
to
get
up.
Come
on.
You
gotta
get
up
now.
You
need
to
get
up.
SCOTT:
Stiles.
Hey.
You
still
got
me.

-
You
okay?

-

Let
me
go,
please,
please.

-

They're
coming.




-
You're
not
going
anywhere.
-
You
don't
remember
anything?
Not
when
it
happens.
Not
when
I
change.
You
clawed
my
dad
half
to
death,
You're
gonna
start
remembering
-
Scott,
I
hear
them.
Hey,
Stiles,
get
him
out
of
here.
Go
to
the
hospital.
Figure
We're
not
gonna
be
able
to
stop
them.
But
we
can
slow
them
down.
Stiles,
go.

We're
gonna
be
okay.
Scott,
we're
gonna
die
down
here.
No,
we're
not.
How
can
you
be
so
sure?
Because
you're
not
the
ARGENT:
Get
down.


Run.
Step
back.
I
think
I
can
break
through
it.
It's
just
sometimes,
most
So
you
better
step
back.





Let's
go.
Dr.
Geyer!
We
have
to
open
him
up.
What?
There's
something
inside
him.
-
Melissa,
we
can't
just
open
him
up.
He's
being
poisoned
by
bone
marrow.
I
know
it
doesn't
make
any
but
you
have
to
open
him
up.
Do
it
now.


It's
okay,
Stiles.
You
still
got
me.

He
was
here.
THEO:
What
else
can
you
tell
me?
Why
don't
you
tell
me
how
I
know
that?
Noah's
part
Berserker.
You're
part
jaguar.
You'll
Is
that
why
I'm
here
with
you?
I
saved
your
life.
What?

I
think
he's
