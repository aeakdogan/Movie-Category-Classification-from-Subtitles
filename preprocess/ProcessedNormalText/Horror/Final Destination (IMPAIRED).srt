She's
concerned
about
you.
I'm
concerned
about
you.
Why
won't
you
talk
to
her?
Gr
me?
--which
could
put
a
cloud
Dad,
you
and
Mom
But
there's
something
I
need
to
understand
--the
Dow
down
75.
The
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
...on
the
possible
cause
of
the
explosion
Officials
believe
...on
an
electrical
connector
...may
have
leaked
combustible
fluids.
-A
spark
in
the
fuel
switch...
...in
the
fuselage
may
have
ignited
the
...which
would
have
set
off
The
path
of
the
explosion.
Okay,
the
first
was
Tod.
They're
dying
in
the
order
That's
death's
design.
Miss
Lewton's
next.
LEWTON:
I
see
Terry
Chaney.
And
in
the
day,
out
of
nowhere...
...I
hear
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
...saying
to
Larry
Murnau:
"No,
you
know
the
whole
French
thing.
Everything
reminds
me
of
that
day.
Right,
yeah.
I'm
hoping
a
change
will
help.
It's
just
that
I've
lived
here
And
everywhere
I
looked
And
now
all
I
see
is
Larry...
...and
those
kids,
you
know?
Just
looking
out
my
own
front
yard
Laura,
I'm
gonna
have
to
call
you
back.
Right.
Hi,
this
is
Valerie
Lewton.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
was
just
....
I
was
checking
the
air
in
the
tire
Get
in
the
car.
Put
on
your
seat
belt.
I
believe
that
Miss
Lewton
is
next.
-Next?
Yeah,
next,
because
there's
this
pattern
Oh,
right,
e
pattern,
yeah.
Mom's
favorite.
[JOHN
DENVER'S
"ROCKY
MOUNTAIN
HIGH"
So,
what
about
this
pattern,
Alex?
Did
you
see
it
Did
you
catch
it
in
some
TV
static?
You
know,
I
never
asked
You
guys
are
gonna
sit
on
your
little
chairs
But
I
saved
six
lives
on
that
plane.
Six
lives,
and
everybody
in
my
entire
school
And
I'm
not--
I'm
not
suffering
I
don't
have
a
narcissistic
deity
complex.
I'm
not
going
Dahmer
on
you
guys.
This
just
is.
There
is
a
pattern
for
us
all.
There's
a
pattern
for
you,
There's
a
design
for
everyone.
But
I'm
gonna
break
this
one.
Alex,
you
came
to
our
attention
at
first...
...because
you
were
under
suspicion
Now,
I
know
And
we
were
ready
to
move
on,
First,
your
friend
Tod.
Then
Terry
Chaney,
And
now
tonight
we
pick
you
Alex,
nobody
has
control
Unless
they
are
taking
lives
Now,
can
you
promise
me
No,
I
can't.
As
long
as
I'm
in
here,
Okay,
go
ahead.
Get
out
of
here.
Thank
you.
That
kid
gives
me
the
creeps.
What
are
we
gonna
do?
That's
not
what
I'm
talking
about.
There
were
a
couple
of
moments
there...
...where
I
almost
believed
him.
Can
I
tell
you
something?
But
sometimes,
you
give
me
the
creeps.


You've
gotta
stop
this.
You're
out
of
here.
You'll
be
gone.

Miss
Lewton.
Miss
Lewton.
Okay,
all
right,
okay.
Just
stay
still,
okay?
Oh,
God.
Ch,
God.
Miss
Lewton.
Hey,
Alex.
BILLY:
I
don't
know
where
he
is.
-He's
not
talking
to
me.
Because
I
didn't
believe
him.
SCHRECK:
...I
think
it
would
be
in
the
best
Now,
here's
my
card.
Toll-free
number.
Interesting
work.

BILLY:

CLEAR:
Terry's
name
should
be
on
this
wall.
Shit.
Why'd
you
want
us
Because
they're
watching
me,
That's
why
you're
taking
me.
Why
would
I
wanna
see
him?
Because
he
knows
[JANE
SIBERRY'S
"ALL
THE
CANDLES
So
drive
the
speed
limit,
okay?
Oh,
and
don't
pass
on
the
right.
Billy,
wait
a
minute
here.
You're
the
next
one,
man.
Hey,
man,
why'd
you
say
that?
Because
if
you
say
another
word,
He
could
be
anywhere
from
here
So
you
guys
drive
down
there,
It'll
take
half
the
time.
Do
you
think
they're
still
up
there?
Somehow,
Flight
180,
Somewhere,
are
they
safe?
When
I
was
a
kid,
like
6
or
7...
...I
used
to
worry
so
much
Lying
awake
at
night
just
worrying.
Yeah,
well,
most
kids
do,
I
guess.
Most
kids
never
have
it
happen.
When
I
was
10,
I
guess
that
he
heard
someone
say,
So
on
reflex,
or
thinking
And
the
guy
blew
his
head
off.
Life
became
shit
after
that.
My
mom
just
couldn't
deal
anymore.
She
married
this
asshole...
...who
my
mom
with
my
real
dad
would
He
really
didn't
want
a
kid.
If
that
was
the
design
...then
fuck
death.
God,
I
have
thought
a
lot
It
exists,
that
place.
Where
he
had
a
full
pack
of
cigarettes
Where
me
and
my
mom
...and
have
no
idea
about
this
life
here.
Where
our
friends
are
still
in
the
sky.
Where
everyone
gets
a
second
chance.
Alex,
we
can't
give
up.
ALEX:
All
right?
After
Miss
Lewton,
CLEAR:
It's
only
a
couple
miles
from
my
house.
All
right,
Browning,
you
fucking
Warlock.
-Did
you
know
about
Miss
Lewton,
or
what?
Billy
told
the
FBI
I
was
running
because
they
blame
me.
They
blame
me
for
Tod,
The
fire,
like,
caramelized
her
blood,
Alex.
-Your
fingerprints
were
on
the
knives.
I'm
not
talking
about
whether
or
not
you
Did
you
know
she
was
gonna
be
next
Yeah,
I
did.
-I
knew.
Gut
of
us,
who's
next
to
see
it?
Please,
tell
me
I'm
gonna
get
to
see
It's
me,
right?
I
knew
I
should
have
felt
up
Tammy
-What
are
you
whining
about?
I'm
next.
You
have
a
responsibility
to
tell
me.
Do
you
think
it's
gonna
make
it
Huh?
it's
not,
You
know,
you
get
off
-You
let
me
decide
how
to
deal
with
it.
Because
we're
all
Oh,
fuck.
Really?
All
right,
then
why
bother?
Me
and
Terry,
we'll
be
back
together
Carter,
what
are
you
doing?
Carter,
slow
down.
-Slow
down,
Carter!
-Knock
it
off.
Not
with
us
in
the
fucking
car.
-Jesus,
Carter,
no.
Carter,
stop
the
car.
Hey,
what's
the
worry
I
could
get
nailed
-it's
only
me.
And
I
fucking
hated
French
class.
CLEAR:
Control
yourself.
I
know
what
you're
doing.
I'm
not
afraid,
all
right?
I
control
my
life,
I
control
my
death.
You
don't
have
to
prove
to
us

-Carter,
stop
driving
like
such
an
asshole.
Fuck
it,
Carter,
Jesus
Christ.
CLEAR:
Carter,
stop.
Oh,
shit.
ALEX:
I
am
so
close
to
puking
CLEAR:
We're
afraid
too,
Carter,
Stop
what
you're
doing
Damn
it,
Carter.



-Billy.
-Hey,
open
the
door,
Billy.
-Hey,
open
the
fucking
door.
ALEX:
CLEAR:
Open
the
door.
CLEAR:
Open
the
door.
CLEAR:
Billy,
open
it!
CLEAR:
Carter,
listen
to
me.
Don't
do
this.
CLEAR:
ALEX:
This
isn't
the
way.
It's
not
the
way.
Get
out
of
the
car.
-Come
on!
-Carter.

Oh,
shit.
Carter,
listen
to
me.
This
isn't
the
way.
CLEAR:
ALEX:
I
can't
get
out!
CLEAR:
Man,
he
really
is
next.
-Get
out!
-Come
on!
Oh,
God.
I
saw
it.
I
saw
the
belt.
-Scared
now?
Bullshit.
He
saved
your
life
again.
That's
right.
You're
next,
Carter.
-Shut
up.
I
don't
need
it
ever.
What
are
you
doing?
Hey,
fuck
you,
Billy.
I'm
not
dead.
Oh,
you
will
be.
And
you
ain't
taking
me
with
you!
CARTER:
Jesus
fucking
Christ!
You
should've
been
next.
That's
the
plan.
That's
the
design.
-You
should
be
dead.
I
saw
the
seat
belt.
I
knew
it
would
rip.

That's
how
I
saved
him.
Just
like
the
explosion,
I
saw
it.
-The
police
are
coming.
Because
I
saved
him...
...it
skipped
Carter,
went
to
the
next
I
have
to
see
it.
And
if
I
see
it,
then
I
intervene.
What,
intervene?
Gods
aren't
afraid
to
die.
Gods
don't
die.
We
do.
-You
know?
The
police
will
be
here.
You
can
hide,
Okay,
after
Billy,
I'm
next.
I'm
next.
-And
then
me.
I'm
not
gonna
let
it
happen,
okay?
-Listen
to
me,
all
right?
Why
don't
you
two
Rusted.
Tetanus.
Nice
one.
I
overlooked
it
You
tried
to
capitalize.
I
can
beat
you.
Yeah,
I
mean,
not
forever,
-She
was
there
a
minute
ago.
I'm
not
turning
him
in.
It's
too
dangerous
for
him
-I
go
with
you.
Clear,
you
just
tell
us
where
he
is.
Wait
at
home,
I
give
you
my
word...
...that
we
will
bring
him
in
safely
I
never
moved.
Christa
asked
me
to
change
seats
I
would've
been
up
next
to
Tod.
Fuck,
why
didn't
I
remember
that?
I
never
moved.
She's
next.

Alex!
Alex!
Come
on,
get
in
the
car.
Come
on!
-Go!

Oh,
shit.
SCHRECK:
There!
SCHRECK:
Alex,
we're
trying
to
help
you.
Fritz,
get
away
from
it.

Come
on.
SCHRECK:

Run!


We
lost
him.
From
the
direction,
No
shit.



ALEX:
No.
Oh,
my
God.
Don't
move.
Stay
there.
Don't
move,
don't
move.
You're
grounded
by
the
tires,
okay?
The
car's
gonna
explode.
I
can
only
hold
on
for
so
long,
Don't!
When
I
do
this,
it'll
skip
you,
-it's
the
only
way
we
can
cheat
death
again.
Clear,
I
am
not
gonna
let
it
beat
us
both.
I'll
always
be
with
you.
NO!
Alex!
Alex,
get
away
from
there.
NO!
Alex.
Alex.
Damn
it,
you
can't
do
this
to
me.
Come
on,
baby.
Come
on.
WEINE:
Alex,
Alex?
Oh,
shit,
he's
not
breathing.
Hold
on,
Alex.
Come
on,
stay
with
me.

-Well,
we
made
it.
I
just
can't
believe
You
know
what
I'm
saying?
[WAITER
AND
ALEX
Wow.
It's
weird
being
here,
huh?
We
finally
completed
a
puzzle.
It's
just
there's
something
missing,
-To
Terry.
-To
Tod.
-Cheers.
What?
If
you
would
have
told
me
...that
the
three
of
us
-Yeah.
I
mean,
sometimes
it
just
feels
...are
the
only
ones
You
were
right,
Browning.
We
beat
it.
You
know,
we
won.
I
think
the
only
thing
we
won,
Carter,
A
chance
that
I
won't
ever
waste.
Yeah,
there's
just
something
....
You
know,
something
I
can't
figure
out.
-What?
Alex,
just
let
it
go.
All
right?
I
swear"
Just
hear
me
out,
all
right?
-Oh,
my
God.
Now,
the
path
of
the
explosion
When
I
intervened
and
saved
Carter...
...it
skipped
him
and
went
to
the
All
right,
and
then
it
was
Clear.
But
I
intervened
and
saved
her,
...no
one
intervened,
right?
I
was
thrown
from
that
power
line
-So--
How
do
we
know
that
this
isn't
exactly
That
out
of
everyone
on
Flight
180,
Maybe
that
was
the
design
all
along.
-Or
you
could
still
be
next.
What?
I
didn't
make
up
the
rules.
Somebody's
gotta
intervene
Alex
proved
that
three
times.
For
all
I
know,
it
could
circle
back
But
I
am
the
safest
fucker
in
the
world
[SINGING
CLEAR:
Let's
figure
out

I'm
gonna
meet
you
back
at
the
hotel.
-Just
wait,
I'll
go
with
you.
Okay,
Clear?
Just
stay
here.
All
right?
See,
it's
true.
Stop
it,
Carter.
CLEAR:
Alex,
wait.
Okay?
Stay
away.
Alex!

Alex!
I
told
you,
you
were
next.
-Then
it
just
skipped
me.
