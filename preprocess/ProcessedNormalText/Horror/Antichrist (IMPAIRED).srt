Hey.
How
are
you?
Didn't
we
just
talk
about
that?
That
was
yesterday.
Today
is
Tuesday.
So
I've
been
here
long?
A
month.
Wayne
says
that...

my
grief
pattern
is
atypical.
Yeah.

Had
a
talk
with
Wayne.
I
think
he
gives
you
too
much
medication.
Stop
it,
please.
Trust
others
to
be
smarter
than
you.
-
He's
straight
out
of
medical
school.
He
doesn't
know
what
he's
doing.
But
you're
not
a
doctor.
No,
I'm
not.
And
I'm
proud
that
I'm
not
There
is
nothing
atypical
It
was
my
fault.
What
about
me?
I
could
have
stopped
him.
No.
You
didn't
know
that
he
had
I
was
aware
that
he
would
and
crawl
out
of
bed...
and
walk
about...
just
as
you
thought
He
could
open
the
baby
gate.
He
-
He
woke
up...
and
was
-
was
confused
and
-

and
-
and
alone.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Dr.
Wayne
says
You
couldn't
leave
it,
could
you?
Had
to
meddle.
This
place
leads
nowhere.
On
the
contrary...
grief
-
It's
not
a
disease.
You
can't
just
remove
it.
Wayne
knows
you're
a
therapist.
He
says
you
shouldn't
In
principle
I
agree,
but
-
But
you're
just
so
much
smarter,
I
love
you.
Nothing
hurts
more
subjected
to
mistakes
and
wrongs.
No
therapist
can
know

It's
all
right.

-
It
hurts.
There's
no
way
around
it.
I
want
to
die
too.
No,
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
do
that.
Will
it
just
go
on
and
on?
No.
No,
it'll
change.
Will
it
get
any
worse?
Yes,
it
will.
You've
always
been
distant
Now
that
I
come
to
think
of
it,
Okay.
Can
you
give
me
Hell,
that's
not
that
difficult
Like
last
summer,
for
instance.
You
were
terribly
distant
As
a
father
and
as
a
husband.
And
that
was
Nic's
last
summer
Too
bad.
I
never
interested
you...
until
now...
that
I
am
your
patient.
Perhaps
I'm
not
supposed
There's
nothing
you
can't
talk
about.
You're
indifferent
to
whether
I
bet
you
have
a
lot
of
clever
Well,
actually...
it
was
to
honor
your
wish.
You
wanted
peace
to
write.
Perhaps
I
didn't
mean
it.
What
I
understood...
is
that
you
wanted
to
write
alone...
that
you
and
Nic
were
going
to
go
to
Eden,
That
way
But
I
didn't.
You
didn't?
You
see?
You
didn't
even
know
that.
Why
did
you
give
up?
The
whole
project
As
you
said
when
I
talked
to
you
I
never
called
your
subject
glib.
Perhaps
you
didn't
use
that
word,
And
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
glib.
Or
even
worse,
I
see.
No,
you
don't
see.
You
see
a
lot
of
things,

lnhale
on
the
count
of
five.

Calmly.
Calmly.
Just
-
Follow
me.
Inhale.
Inhale
on
the
count
of
five.
Inhale.
Two.
-

I'm
gonna
teach
you
how
to
breathe.
-
Inhale.
Two,
three,
four,
five.
Hold.
Two,
three,
four,
five.
-
Exhale.
Two,
three,
four
-
Good.
Imagine
-
Imagine
you're
blowing
CaImly,
quietIy.
-

That's
good.
That's
very
good.
I
told
you
there
would
be
a
change.
You're
still
mourning,
-
What
phase?
-
Anxiety?
This
is
physical.
-
It's
dangerous.
Just
as
your
grief
wasn't
dangerous.
The
main
part
of
anxiety
is
physical.
Dizzy
speIIs,
dry
mouth...
distorted
hearing,
trembling...
heavy
breathing,
fast
pulse,
nausea.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Easy.
No
matter
how
much
I
know
it
distracts
you,
-
Do
the
breathing.
-
Hold.
-
Exhale.
Do
you
love
me?
Yes,
I
do.
Then
help
me.


That's
the
only
thing
Everything
else
is
just
talk.
You
have
to
have
the
courage
and
then
you'll
learn
Let's
make
a
list
of
things
At
the
top,
But
I
don't
know
what
I'm
afraid
of.
Just...
take
your
time.
I'm
thinking.
Okay.
I'm
thinking,
uh,
but,
uh
-
Can't
I
just
be
afraid




-


-

Hey.
No.
No!
No!
-
Calmly.
Oh,
God.


-

This
won't
do.
Stup
-
Stupidest
thing
If
you
can't
tell
me
maybe
it
would
be
easier
where
you're
afraid.
Where
would
you
feel
most
exposed?
What
would
be
the
worst
place?
The
apartment?
The
street?
A
store?
The
park?
Visiting
someone
maybe?
The
woods.
The
woods?
The
woods,
yes.
It's
funny,
because...
you
were
the
one
that
always
What
scares
you
about
the
woods?
What
frightens
you
there?
Everything.
Tell
me
what
you
think
I
-
Is
it
any
woods
in
particular?
-
Eden.
Well,
what
do
you
say
we
put...
-

at
the
top
of
the
pyramid?
No.
Not
quite
at
the
top.

-


-
Okay.



Ow!
Ow.

-
It's
o
-
It's
okay.
It's
all
right.
-
I
don't
know
-
We
can
start
by
Close
your
eyes.
Feel
the
seat
underneath
you.
Feel
yourseIf
sinking
down
into
it...
enfolding
you.
It's
a
nice
feeling.
What
you
feel
is
a
pleasant
warmth...
and
heaviness.
Your
breath
is
deep...
regular...
easy.
Now...
imagine
you're
at
Eden.
Imagine
you
arrive
at
Eden
Tell
me
what
you
see.

It's
evening.
Almost
no
birds
can
be
heard.
The
water
is
running
without
a
sound.
Darkness
comes
early
down
here.
I
walk
into
it.
The
littIe
deers...
are
hiding
among
the
ferns...
as
usual.


Not
really.
In
fact,
it's
almost
okay.
In
among
the
trees...
on
the
slope...
is
the
oId
fox
hole.


It
should
be
easy
passing...
and
yet...
it's
like
walking
through
mud.
The
trunk
is
thick.
The
tree
rots
so
slowly.
It
has
some
strange
I've
aIways
felt
that.

Where
are
you?
Are
you
-

I'm
walking
up
the
path...
through
the
tall
grass.

Don't
go
in.
It's
the
outside
you're
afraid
of.
No.
Lie
down
on
the
green.


-

On
top
of
all
the
plants?
Are
you
lying
down?


What
is
everything
like
around
you?

It's
all
very
green.

Now
will
you
do
what
I
ask
you?

What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
I
want
you...
to
melt
into
the
green.
Don't
fight
it.
Just
turn
green.
No
matter
what
happens,
Let
fear
come
if
it
likes.
Remember...
what
the
mind
can
conceive
and
believe,
What's
wrong?
The
ground
is
burning.
The
ground
is
not
burning.
Gotta
go.
I
want
to
lie
down.
Just
for
a
minute.
Sure.
Yeah,
we'll
take
a
rest.


Shouldn't
we
go
on?
Yeah.
Yeah,
we
should.
Stay.
Stay
with
it.
I
know
it
hurts.
Stay.
Stay
in
it!



It's
just
the
stupid
acorns.


What
are
you
doing?
I'm
just
-
I'm
setting
up...
a
little
exercise.
It's
-
It's
like
a
-
It's
like
a
game.
You
cheated
me
yesterday.
Running's
no
good.
You
have
to
reaIIy
feel
the
grass.
I
want
you
to
go
from
this
stone...
to
this
stone.
Pretty
scary,
huh?
You
ready?
Here.
I'll
give
you
a
ride.
I'll
put
you
on
the
first
stone.
Stay
with
it.
Here
we
go.
Now
put
your
foot
down.
I'm
right
here.
-
I
can't
do
this.
You
can
and
you
will,
We're
gonna
walk
together.
We're
gonna
walk
together,
okay?
Now
-
All
right,
now
breathe.
-

You're
gonna
step
on
that
grass.
See?
What
happened?
-

I've
got
you.
Okay?
Five,
five
and
five.

We're
almost
there.
-
We're
almost
there.
You're
doing
great.

We're
there.
See?
We're
there.
There
you
go.
You
did
it.
You
Iearned
something.
Didn't
you?

You
did
beautifully.


I
miss
him
so
much.

I've
been
afraid
up
here
before.
Yes,
it
seems
likely.
I
just
didn't
know
it
was
fear.
I
became
afraid...
and
I
stopped
writing.
What
was
different
the
last
time?
I
heard
a
sound.


-
Nic?
Nic!

Nic!
-







Apparently
not.
And
because
you
experienced
something
you
placed
Eden
very
high
Eden
was
the
catalyst
You
jumped
to
conclusions...
and
tied
the
emotionaI
event
When
you
feel
threatened,
If
the
danger
were
real,
because
your
adrenaline
But
what
you're
experiencing
is
panic,
The
scream
wasn't
real.

Stop!
-
Cal
-
Calm
-
You
shouldn't
have
come
here.
You're
just
so
damn
arrogant.
But
this
may
not
last.
Ever
thought
of
that?

Oak
trees
grow
to
be
They
only
have
to
produce
in
order
to
propagate.
It
may
sound
banal
to
you,
but...
it
was
a
big
thing
for
me
to
realize
that
The
acorns
fell
on
the
roof
then
too.
They
kept
falling
and
falling...
and
dying
and
dying.
And
I
understood
that...
everything
that
used
to
be
was
perhaps
hideous.
Now
I
could
hear...
what
I
couldn't
hear
before
-

the
cry
of
all
the
things...
that
are
to
die.
That's
all...
very
touching...
if
it
was
a
children's
book.
Acorns
don't
cry.
You
know
that
as
well
as
I
do.
That's
what
fear
is.
Your
thoughts
distort
reality...
not
the
other
way
around.
Satan's
church.
Satan?
Jesus!
Nature
is
Satan's
church.
-
What?
Why,
there
you
have
him.
That
was
his
breath.


He
drifted
away
from
me
He
was
always
out
and
about.
He
might
have
made

You
look
like
you
slept
well.
Thanks.
I
did.
I
just
wanted
to
say
I
love
you,
darling.
Did
you
have
a
good
sleep?
I've
just
been
having
Dreams
are
of
no
interest
Freud
is
dead,
isn't
he?

-
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
well
again.

I'm
cured.
You're
so
clever.
I'm
fine.
You
can't
just
be
happy
for
me,





Um,
I'd
like
to
do
one
more
exercise.
It's
like
role-playing.
My
role
is...
all
the
thoughts
Yours
is
rational
thinking.
I'm
nature.
All
the
things
that
you
call
nature.
Okay,
Mr.
Nature.
What
do
-
What
do
you
want?
To
hurt
you
as
much
as
I
can.
How?
How
do
you
think?
By
frightening
me?
By
killing
you.
Nature
can't
harm
me.
You're
just
all
the
greenery
outside.
No.
I'm
more
than
that.
I
don't
understand.
I'm
outside,
but
also...
within.
I'm
nature
of
all
human
beings.
Oh,
that
kind
of
nature.

The
kind
of
nature
that
causes
people...
to
do
evil
things
against
women?
That's
exactIy
who
I
am.
That
kind
of
nature
interested
me
a
lot...
when
I
was
up
here.
That
kind
of
nature
But
you
shouldn't
underestimate
Eden.
What
did
Eden
do?
I
discovered
something
else
If
human
nature
is
evil...
then
that
goes
as
well
for
the
nature
of
-

FemaIe
nature.

Women
do
not
controI
their
own
bodies.
I
have
it
in
writing
in
my
books.
The
literature
was
about
evil
things
But
you
read
it
You
were
supposed
to
be
That
was
your
thesis.
Do
you
-
Do
you
know
what
you're
saying?
Forget
it.
I
don't
know
why
I
said
it.
I-I
can't
work
anymore
now.

Hit
me.
-
What?
No.
-
Hit
me,
please!


Then
you
don't
love
me.
Okay.
Maybe
I
don't
love
you.

Again.
Again.

The
sisters
from
Ratisbon



I'm
not
gonna
continue
this
Good
and
evil
-
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
therapy.
Do
you
know
how
many
in
the
16th
century
alone
I'm
sure
you
do
-
many.
And
not
because
they
were
evil.
I
know.
It's
just
sometimes
I
forget.
The
evil
you
talk
about
is
an
obsession.
Obsessions
never
materialize.
Anxieties
can't
trick
you
into
doing
things
It's
like
hypnotism.
You
can't
be
hypnotized
you
wouldn't
normally
do...
something
against
your
nature.
Do
you
understand
me?
-
Yeah,
I
think
so.
Well,
you
don't
have
to
understand
me.
-
What's
this?
It's
a
copy
of
the
autopsy
report.
The
autopsy?
Did
they
perform
an
autopsy?
I
didn't
want
to
tell
you
Well,
what
did
they
find?
Nothing
that
would
have

"is
a
slight
deformity
of
the
bones
We
did
not
attach
Are
you
aware
that
you
put
So
I
have.
How
weird.
Slip
of
the
mind
that
day.

Herself.
Oh!
Bastard!
-

-
You're
leaving
me!
-
I'm
helping
you.
No!

-
I
Iove
you.
-
I
don't
believe
you!
I
don't
fucking
believe
you!
Oh!









Ow!



Where
are
you?
You
bastard!

Where
are
you?

-

You
bastard!
Where
are
you?
How
dare
you
leave
me!


Where
are
you?
-



You
bastard!




-

-






Get
out!
Get
out!
Get
out!
You
bastard!
Come
out!
Get
out!
You
bastard!
Come
out!




We
gotta
get
this
thing
off
my
leg.
I
can't
find
the
wrench.


Did
you
want
to
kill
me?
Not
yet.
The
three
beggars
aren't
here
yet.
The
three
beggars.
What
does
that
mean?
When
the
three
beggars
arrive,
I
see.

A
crying
woman
is
a
scheming
woman.
"False
in
legs,
and
false
in
thighs.
False
in
breast,
teeth,
hair
and
eyes."



Hold
me.




There's
no
such
consteIIation.


But
none
of
it
is
any
use.
None
of
it
is
any
use.
-

No!
