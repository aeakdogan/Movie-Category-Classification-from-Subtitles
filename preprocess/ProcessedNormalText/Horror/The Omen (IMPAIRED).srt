The
child
is
dead.
He
breathed
just
for
a
moment.
The
child
is
dead.
Dead.
The
child
is
dead.
I'm
afraid
it
will
kill
her.
My
God,
she
wanted
a
baby
so
much.
For
such
a
long
time.
What
can
I
tell
her?
What...
will
I
say?
You
could
adopt
a
child.
She
wanted
her
own.
If
I
may
suggest,...
...it
even
resembles...
Your
wife
need
never
know.
It
would
be
a
blessing
to
her...
...and
to
the
child.
Are
there
no
relatives?
None.
The
mother
died,
as
your
own
child,...
...in
the
same
moment.
You
said
it
could
be
ours,
but...
On
this
night,
Mr
Thorn,...
...God
has
given
you
a
son.
Oh.
Here's
your
boy.
-
Buongiorno.
Bene.
-
What
are
you
doing
home
so
early?
What?
We
can't
waste
any
time.
We're
leaving
Please,
Carlo.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
am
talking
about
London.
I
am
talking
about
-
Well,
what
about
him?
I'm
what?
It's
me.
I'm
appointed
I've
already
told
them
yes.
Well,
it's
a
bit
much.
Well,
nothing's
too
much
for
the
wife
You
know,
you're
pushy.
Come
on.
Wait
till
you
see
this.
Now,
this...
they
call
his
day
room.
His
day
room.
-
So?
How
do
you
like
it
so
far?
-
Well,
it
needs
some
books.
To
warm
it
up.
Mm.
-
Something
in
mind,
Mr
Ambassador?
Well,
there's
no
furniture
up
there,
either.
You
know,
you
could
be
-
I'm
gonna
miss
you
so
much.
We
don't
have
that
much
to
talk
about.
Since
when
did
two
old
college
roommates
Since
one
of
them
assumed
-
Well,
give
my
regards
to
the
first
lady.
Why
don't
you
change
you
mind,
No,
I'd
better
stay
here
-
Where
is
he?
Damien?
-
Damien?
Damien!
Damien!
Damien!
Oh,
my
God,
Robert.
Damien!
Robert,
where
could
he
be?
Damien!
You
little
monkey!
There
you
are.

-
Go.
#
Happy
birthday
to
you
#
Happy
birthday
to
you
#
Happy
birthday,
dear
Damien
#
Happy
birthday
to
you

Run
out
of
film?
-
How's
that?
-
...or
Jesus
Christ
himself.

Go
on,
Damien.
Smile.
Come
on.
Smile.
Holly!
-
I'll
take
him,
ma'am.
Come
on.
One...
two...
three...
Let
me
jump
on
it,
Daddy.
Let
me
jump
on
it.
Hold
on!

Damien!
Damien!
Damien,
look
at
me!
I'm
over
here!
-
Damien,
I
love
you.
Look
at
me,
Damien.
It's
all
for
you!
Oh,
my
God!
Go,
Tom.
-
Morning.
Have
you
read
the
papers
today?
There
was
an
article
on
the
suicide,
-
They
say
that
she
left
a
suicide
note,
sir.
Mr
Ambassador,
Would
you
mind?
-
Mr
Thorn,
did
she
use
drugs?
-
The
article
said...
I'm
sorry.
I
am
sorry.
No,
that's
all
right,
Mr
Ambassador.
Corporal.
OK,
outside.
-

-
There's
a
Father
Brennan
here
to
see
you.
A
priest
named
Father
Brennan
from
Rome.
He
says
it's
a
matter
of
-
Never
heard
of
him.
-
Something
about
a
hospital.
-
All
right,
send
him
in.
On
that
trip
to
Saudi
Arabia,
Well,
it's
personal,
Tom.
I
just,
uh...
Yes,
Father?
We
haven't
much
time.
All
right.
What
is
it?
You
must
accept
Christ
as
your
saviour.
Forgive
me,
but
didn't
I
understand
that
you
You
must
take
Communion.
Only
if
he
is
within
you
-
I
see.
He'll
kill
until
everything
that's
yours
is
his.
-
Father,
would
you
mind...
Accept
the
Lord
Jesus.
Drink
his
blood.
I've
locked
the
door,
Mr
Thorn.
-
Yes?
I
beg
you,
Mr
Thorn.
Ambassador
Thorn?
I
was
at
the
hospital,
Mr
Thorn,
-
I
witnessed
the
birth.
-
I
beg
you.
All
right.
Stand
by.
-
What
do
you
want?
So
Christ
will
forgive
me.
What
do
you
know
about
my
son?
-
Everything.
I
saw
its
mother.
-
You
saw
my
wife.
-
You're
referring
to
my
wife!
This
is
blackmail!
Come
out
and
say
it.
His
mother
was
a
ja...
-
Everything
OK?
-
I
want
this
gentleman
escorted
out
of
here.
Accept
Christ
each
day.
Drink
his
blood.
-
Just
get
him
off
the
grounds.
Father.
Thank
you.

Come
in.
Excuse
me.
Mrs
Baylock
is
here.
She
says
she's
the
new
governess.
Well,
that's
a
start.
Show
her
in.
Come
in,
please.
-
Ambassador
and
Mrs
Thorn.
I,
erm...
I
know
it's
a
difficult
time
for
you,
I'm
here
to
take
away
We'll
soon
help
your
little
boy
I'm
afraid,
sir,
...they
get
homesick,
I
left
all
that
behind
a
long
time
ago.
Well,
now,
if
you'll
let
me
see
your
boy?
Yes,
of
course.
He's
upstairs.
Why
don't
you
just
leave
us
alone
at
first?
-
Well,
he's
shy
with
new
people.
-
Well,
I
don't
think...
Go
on.
Give
it
a
try.
All
right,
then.
-
Mrs
Horton.
Excuse
me.
-
I
like
her.
Where'd
you
find
her?
-
Where
did
I
find
her?
I
didn't
find
her.
I
assumed
you
found
her.
Round
that
corner
to
the
right
-
I'll
have
your
things
sent
up
in
a
moment.
-
Oh,
Mrs
Baylock.
I'm
sorry,
but,
uh...
we're
a
little
bit
confused.
Oh?
Why's
that?
-
Well,
we
don't
know
how
you
got
here.
-
The
agency?
...well,
about
your
first
nanny,
-
Oh,
that's
it.
Oh,
erm...
-
Here
are
my
references.
Well,
if...
if
I
could
see
your
boy...
now?
-
Yes,
of
course.
Have
no
fear,
little
one.
I
am
here
to
protect
thee.
-
In
a
minute,
Horton,
I
think.
-
Kathy!
-
Mrs
Baylock!
-
Where's
Damien?
...I
think
he'd
rather
go
to
the
park.
-
The
park?
I
told
you
he
was
going
with
us.
-
He'll
cause
a
fuss.
It
is
my
wish
and
my
husband's
wish
-
Kathy!
Now,
please
have
him
dressed
at
once.
Well,
excuse
me
...but
do
you
really
think
a
five-year-old...
...will
understand
the
goings-on
Will
you
have
my
son
dressed
and
in
the
car
What's
the
matter,
Damien?
Oh,
it's
just
a
church,
that's
all.
What's
the
matter?
-
Robert.
-
I
don't
know.
He
just
seems
scared
to
death.
No,
he's
just...
No,
he's
just
trembling
all
over.
-
Mr
Ambassador.
Welcome,
sir.
-
No!
-
Damien!
Damien,
stop
it.
Damien.
No!
Horton,
drive
on.
Are
you
sure
that
No,
it's
just
a
couple
of
bruises.
No,
I
mean...
for
Damien.
Oh,
no,
he's
fine.
He's...
he's
sound
asleep.
Just...
just
to
have
him
examine
him.
Well,
he's
perfectly
all
right.
He
never
has,
has
he?
Is
it?
I
mean,
no
measles
or
mumps
or
chickenpox.
-
Not
even
a
cough
or
a
cold.
I
just
think
it's
a
little
unusual.
Look,
he's
a
perfectly
healthy
boy.
I
mean,
we
have
nothing
to
worry
about
He
just...
had
a
bad
moment.
You
know,
like
a
fright.

Yes?
-
I'm
leavin'
now.
Is
there
anything
else?
I
think
the
best
thing
to
do
with
a
bad
day
I'll
be
along
soon.

Quiet,
now.
This
is
the
master
of
the
house.
-
What
is
this?
The
dog.
-
Beautiful,
isn't
he?
We
found
him
outside.
I
thought
we
could
use
a
good
watchdog,
sir.
Gave
you
a
fright,
did
he,
sir?
-
Yes.
As
a
watchdog,
I
mean.
I
think
you'll
be
Mrs
Baylock,
we
don't
need
a
dog,...
...and
if
we
do,
I'll
pick
him
out
myself.
-
Damien's
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
him,
sir.
...tell
them
to
collect
the
dog
You
understand?
Sir.
Come
on,
boy.
Welcome
to
Windsor
Safari
Park.
Animal
compound
to
your
left.
Parking,
for
refreshment
and
zoo
area,
When
driving
through
animal
compounds,
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Come
on,
darling.
-
Good
morning,
Horton.
Baboons
bite.
Keep
all
car
windows
closed.
Keep
all
car
windows
closed.
Baboons
are
dangerous.

Oh,
no!
-
All
right,
Kathy?
You're
so...
silent
this
evening.
Just
tired,
I
guess.
Sorry.
-
Damien
all
right?
-
You
sure?
If
there
were
anything
wrong,
Wrong?
What
could
be
wrong
with
our
child,
There
is
something
wrong,
isn't
there?
Kathy.
Is
it
so
serious?
Robert,
I...
I
want...
I
need
to
see
a
psychiatrist.
I...
I
have...
fears.
I
have
such
fears.
What
kind
of
fears?
What
kind?
If
I
told
you,
you'd
put
me
away.
Kathy,
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
Then
help
me.
Find
me
a
doctor.
I
will.
Of
course
I
will.

Keep
that
scrum
tight!
Let
it
go!
Let
it
go!

Bring
him
down!
Well
done!
I
don't
know
what
you're
clapping
for.
-
That's
right.
27-3?
-
I
thought
it
was
two.
Well
done,
George.
Great
stuff.
It
was
a
good
game.
Go
and
have
a
quick
drink
with
the
lads.
That'll
give
me
time
Tomorrow,
half
past
two,
Bishop's
Park.
Your
wife
is
in
danger.
Father!
Thanks
again.
Get
on
with
it.
Say
what
you
have
to
say.
"When
the
Jews
return
to
Zion,...
...and
a
comet
rips
the
sky,...
...and
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
rises,
"From

eternal
sea

rises,

of
Revelations
predicted
it
all.
"It
is

a
human
personality

You
said
that
my
wife...

old
city
of
Jezreel.
There,

the
old

He
alone
can
say
how

you

You're
mistaken.
That's
nonsense.

You're
insane.
You
asked
for
five
minutes,
Go
to
the
city
of
Megiddo.
Now,
I've
heard
you.
I
want
you
to
hear
me.
I
never
want
to
see
you
again.
You'll
see
me
in
hell,
Mr
Thorn.
There
will
we
share
out
our
sentence.
No!

Mrs
Baylock!
-
Anything
wrong?
It's
not
all
that
bad.
-
Good
morning,
Damien.
-
What
are
we
gonna
do?
-
Right.
Yes,
ma'am?
-
Would
you
take
him
out
of
here,
please?
Would
you
just
get
him
out
of
here,
please?
Yes,
ma'am.
Come
along,
Damien.
Excuse
me,
sir.
Come
along.
Darling,
I
don't
know
I
just
don't
seem
to
be
able
to...
I
don't
know.
Kathy,
I
love
you.
If
this
is
what
the
doctor's
doing
to
you,...
...don't
you
think
it's
time
Yes,
you
should.
There's
something
Oh?
Robert,
I...
I
don't
ever
All
right.
Then
you'll
agree
to
an
abortion?
I'm
pregnant,
Robert.

Yes?
Yes,
this
is
he.
Who?
Who?
But...
Hello?
Hello?
Something
about
the
newspapers.
Well,
she
knew
how
much
you
wanted
one.
Now
she
can't
cope.
She
searches
for
reasons
She
has
these
fantasies.
She
fantasises
that
your
child
is
alien
She
thinks
that
the
child
is
evil?
The
point
is,
at
this
time,
Well,
in
what
way...
evil?
Now,
this
is
just
fantasy.
The
most
important
thing
for
you
to
do
No!
I'd
like
to
know
your
reason.
It
was
foretold
that
I'm
going
to
fight
to
see
that
it's
not.
-
Forgive
me,
Doctor.
I'm
sorry.
I
must
get
home.

Oh!
Damien!
Damien!
No,
no,
no,
no!
No!
No!
Aagh!
Are
there
any
developments

How
is
your
wife,
Mr
Ambassador?

Ambassador
Thorn?
My
name
is...
Becker.
Is
she...
all
right?
Well,
she
will
recover.
She's
in
there.
Bed
by
the
window.
She
has
a
concussion
...and...
well,
some
internal
bleeding.
-
Internal
bleeding?
But
she's
pregnant.
No.
-
She's
lost
it?
You
know,
you've
got
a
lot
to
be
grateful
for.
And,
with
proper
care,
Robert.
-
Robert.
Don't
let
him
kill
me.
Don't
let
him
kill
me.
Kathy.
Kathy.
Kathy.
Kathy.
It's
all
right.
Kathy.



-
Yes?
-
Who
is
this?
The
photographer
Would
it
be
possible
-
If
it's
about
the
camera...
It's
about
you,
Mr
Thorn.
-
And
the
death
of
the
priest.
Go
on.
Do
you
notice
anything
unusual?
No.
Sorry.
At
first
I
thought
A
strange
coincidence.
Then
it
happened
again.
Interesting,
don't
you
think?
And
this...
I
took
on
the
day
-
Same
thing?
...and
it's
actually

rest,
of
course
-
history.
I
can't
explain
it.
That's
why
I
started
digging.

first
item...
is
a
diary.
It
didn't
say
anything
about
him.
It's
about
you.

time

you
had
your
lunch
in,
The
last

says
that

first
clipping
Reports
an
unusual
phenomenon.
A
comet

the
star
of
Bethlehem
2,000
years
ago.
This
one
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
world,
6
June,
to
be
exact.
Does
that
date
mean
anything
to
you?
Yes.
Then
you'll
recollect
this
other
clipping.
It's
a
birth
announcement
Also
dated
6
June,
five
years
ago.
The
day
your
son
was
born.
The
sixth
month,
sixth
day.
Was
your
son
born
at
6am?
Yes,
I'm
sorry.
I'm
just
trying
to
work
out
My
son
is...
dead.
I
don't
know
whose
son
I'm
raising.
If
you
wouldn't
mind,
No.
It's
my
problem.
No,
sir,
you're
wrong.
It's
my
problem
too.
When
I
came
here
with
the
police,
I
happened
to
catch
sight
I
know
you
must
think
I'm
crazy,
Don't
be
afraid.
You'll
be
all
right
here.
Ow.
Some
all
right!

What
about
Damien?
She'll
look
after
him.

Horton?
Mrs
Horton?
-
Mrs
Baylock.

Where's
Mrs
Horton?
-
Gone
out?
They
left
an
address
for
you
Well,
didn't...
Mrs
Horton
say
anything?
No.
But
don't
worry,
sir.
I
can
manage.

I'll
look
into
this
when
I
get
back.

Oh,
and
Mrs
Baylock?

night,
I
saw
that
dog
in
Damien's
room.
He's
gone
now,
sir.
-
Non

questo.
-
Non

questo.
No.
Io
ricordo
la
vecchia,
in
mattone.
This
is
the
right
address.
Ci
fu
un
incendio
anni
fa.
-
Ma
cosa

successo?
-
Il
vecchio
ospedale
fu
distrutto.
-
...and
the
old
hospital
burned
down.
Five
years
ago.
-
Aspetta,
per
favore.
But
surely
the
fire
didn't
destroy
everything.
Mi
dispiace.
Isn't
it
possible
-
I
do
not
know.
This
is
most
important
to
me.
I
adopted
a
child
here.
-
There
were
no
adoptions
here.
-
No,
signore.
-
You
are
mistake.
Birth
records.
It's
no
use.
The
fire
started
All
the
paperwork
was
there.
Shot
up
the
stairwells.
-
The
third
floor?
-
You
will
excuse
me?
-
Surely
some
survived.
There
was
a
tall
man,
a
priest.
Dark
eyes.
Piercing
eyes.
S.
Padre
Spiletto.
Yes.
-
He
was
principale.
-
Yes,
he
is
alive.
-
No.
He's
in
a
monastero
in...
Frosinone.
Many
were
taken
there.
Many
die.
Perhaps
he
is
die
since,
I
remember
people
say
it
was
un
miracolo.
-
Frosinone?
-
Mille
grazie,
signora.
-
Here
we
are.
-
"When
the
Jews
return
to
Zion..."
"When
the
Jews
return
to
Zion..."
And
there
was
something
about
a
comet.
Yes,
that's
here
too.
"The
shower
of
stars
These
are
supposed
to
be
the
events
The
devil's
child.
It's
making
more
sense.
The
Jews
have
As
for
the
rise
of
the
Roman
Empire,...
...scholars
think
that
could
well
mean
-
Bit
of
a
stretch.
-
"He
shall
rise
from
the
eternal
sea."
"From
the
eternal
sea
he
rises,
-
That
was
the
beginning
of
it.
...the
"eternal
sea"
...the
sea
that
constantly
rages
So
the
devil's
child
will
rise

Looks
like
this
is
as
far
as
we
go.
Let's
have
a
look.
Found
him?
His
mind
is
active,
We
feed
him
and
take
care
of
his
needs.
And
we
pray
for
his
recovery
What
penance?
"Woe
to
the
shepherd
"May
his
right
arm
wither
He's
fallen
from
grace.
Can
you
tell
us
why?
For
abandoning
Christ.
-
How
do
you
know
he's
abandoned
Christ?
-
But
he
doesn't
speak.
He
was
able
to
write
it
down.
You
will
notice
the
curved
line
over
the
head.
This
indicates
the
hood
of
the
monk.
-
The
three
sixes.
-
But
why
three
of
them?
-
The
devil,
Antichrist
and
false
prophet.
For
everything
holy,
there
is
something
Father
Spiletto,
my
name
is
Thorn.
There
was
a
child.
-
I
am
afraid
that...
-
What
happened?
You
said
you
knew
its
mother.
-
I
must
insist
that
you
do
not...
Answer
me!
Answer!

Excuse
me.
Cervet.
Please...
does
it
mean
something
to
you?
Cerveteri.
It
is
an
old
cemetery
from
Etruscan
times.
Cripta
Sant
'Angelo.
-
It
is
nothing
but
ruins.
-
But
there
is
nothing
there.
Only
graves.
You
will
find
it
on
the
map.

Robert,
over
here!
Maria...
Scianna.
My
God.
June
6.
Five
years
ago.
Bambino
Scianna.
Infant
boy.
Same
date.

"Mortuum
et
natum

"In
birth
and
death,
Is
my
son...
...buried
here?
This
woman
could
be
Why
here
in
this
terrible
place?
-
No.
-
The
other
one.
If
it's
an
animal
too,...
...then
maybe
my
child...
...is
alive
somewhere.
They
murdered
him.
They
murdered
him
as
soon
as
he
was
born.
Murderers.
Murderers.

Come
on.
Robert.

Don't
run.
It's
only
the
smell
of
the
graves.
Run!
Robert!
Aagh!
Aagh!

-
Hello?
Kathy?
Hello,
Robert.
Is
that
you?
Kathy,
darling.
Do
just
what
I
say.
I
want
you
to
leave
London
right
now.
-
What
do
you
mean,
leave
London,
darling?
Tom
Portman
will
meet
you
at
the
hospital
-
Robert,
what's
happened?
What's
wrong?
Get
ready
to
leave.
-
Robert,
I
don't
think
I
can
move
very
well.
OK.
Yes,
all
right,
I'll...
All
right,
darling.
Who
is
that?
Is
that
somebody
there?
Tom?
Is
that
you?



Yes?
Yes,
this
is
he.
Tom?
Kathy?
Tom,...
...I
can't...
talk
now.
Robert.
I
found
out
about
the
town
of
Megiddo.
It's
derived
from
the
word
"Armageddon".
The
end
of
the
world.
It's
underground,
There's
some
excavation
going
on
there.
If
only
you
could
remember
the
name
It's
Bugenhagen.
He
was
an
exorcist.
I
read
about
him.
That
was
his
name.
"When
the
Jews
return
to
Zion,...
...and
a
comet
fills
the
sky...
...and
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
rises,...
...then
you
and
I
must
die."
"From
the
eternal
sea
he
rises,...
...creating
armies
on
either
shore...
...turning
man
against
his
brother...
...till
man
exists
no
more."
Kathy
is
dead.
I
want
Damien
to
die,
too.
Hello,
Mr
Thorn.
I
am
Bugenhagen.
-

What
is
this
place?
Town
of
Megiddo.
The
place...
...where
Christianity
began.
The
little
priest
-
is
he
dead
yet?
Yes.
Yes.
Come
along,
Mr
Thorn.
You
will
excuse
us.
This
is
for
Mr
Thorn
alone.
All
right.
It
must
be
done
on
hallowed
ground.
A
church.
His
blood
must
be
spilled
on
the
altar
of
God.
This
first
knife
is
most
important.
It
extinguishes
physical
life
The
subsequent
placings
...and
should
radiate
outward.
Like
this.
This
is
not
a
human
child.
Make
no
mistake.
-
Is
there
proof?
He
bears
a
birthmark.
A
sequence
of
sixes.
So,
says
the
Bible,
-
He
doesn't
have
it.
I've
bathed
him.
I
know
every
inch
of
him.
If
it
is
not
visible
on
the
body,
Remove
it.
You
must
be
devoid
of
pity.
-
And
the
woman?
She
will
die
before
permitting
this.
Look,
I
want
to
know
what
he
said.
Robert,
I
want
to
know
what
he
said!
-
I
was
the
one
that
found
him!
These
are
knives.
He
wants
me
to
stab
him.
-
Wants
me
to
murder
a
child.
How
can
he
know
that?
Maybe
he's
wrong.
It's
insane.
I
won't
have
anything
He's
not
responsible.
I
won't
do
it.
Well,
if
you
don't
do
it,
I
will.


No!
Run,
Damien!
Run!
Run!
No!


Hold
it.
Hey!
-

control.

pursuit.

We've
got
a

I'll
be

later,
all
right?
