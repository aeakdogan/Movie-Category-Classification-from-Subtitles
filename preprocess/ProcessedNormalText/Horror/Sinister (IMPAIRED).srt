Ashley?
Honey.
Sweetheart.

What
are
you
doing?
Yeah.
I
know.
I
think
your
mom
I
know.
So
come
outside.
I
didn't
wanna
move
here.
We
had
to
move
here
-
Uh-uh.
You
wanted
to
move
here.
The
new
story
I'm
writing
is
here.
Why
can't
you
just
keep
writing
'Cause
I
was
gonna
have
to
write
college
-
And
I
can't
do
that.
-
'Cause
I
just
can't.
Well,
you
know
what?
The
school
here
But
I
want
my
old
one.
I
know.
How
about
this,
all
right?
If
we
don't
like
it
here,
But
only
if
we
don't
like
it
here.
-
Really?
You
promise?
I
promise.
But
you
have
to
promise

I
promise.

What's
the

Where
doesn't
it
go?
Right.
OK,
now,
come
with
me.

Be
nice.
Afternoon.
Is
there
a
problem?
No,
sir.
Just
a
friendly
visit.
I
appreciate
that.
Ellison
Oswalt.
I
know
who
you
are.
-
So
you're
not
a
fan.
Well,
what
can
I
do
for
you?
Well,
not
much,
I
expect,
to
load
those
boxes
back
on
that
truck
No,
I
don't
think
so,
I
do
have
a
couple
of
extra
copies
if
you
want
me
to
get
one
out

No,
thank
you,
sir.

Your
bad

a

Now,
this

doesn't
need
that.
We
sure
don't
want
that
circus
Well,
there's
a
missing
girl
-
She
ain't
missing.
She's
dead.
If
that
girl
is
still
alive,
and
we
ain't
ever
gonna
find
her.
Then
I
guess
You
don't
think

Something
like

You

if
you
were
able
to,
the
odds
are
Now,
we
did
our

You'll
see
that.
And
this
is
just
another
waste

Mm-hm.

a
few
houses

If
we
did,
I
don't
wanna
know
about
it.

We
didn't.

Is
the

a
good
one
this
time?

Will
you
show
me
where
it
happened?
I'm
old
enough
to

about
this

No,
youre
not.
Even
I'm
not
old

Your
father

I
shouldn't

about

That's
the
way
you
said
it.
I'm
gonna
hear
about
it
Kids'll
all
hate
me
again
-
Hey,
nobody
hates
you.
-
Are
you
listening
to
this?
Let's
at
least
make
sure
It's
one
thing
to
hear
about
it,
I
don't
want

walking
in
again.

he
knows
how
old
I
am.

I
don't
wanna
hear

Yeah.
You
didn't
brush
your

No.

No,
I
thought
I'd
set
up
my

How
long
is
it
gonna
be?
No,
I
mean...
Oh,
God'
I
don't
know.
I
liked
it
better

Nobody
likes
my
fiction.
I
can't
do
this
without
you
by
my
side.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
on
your
side.
I
just
wanna
see
you
When
you're
happy...
we're
all
happy.
I
just
need
another
hit,
that's
all.
-
Just
one
more.
What?
-
You
know
I'm
behind
you
on
this.
But
that's
not
what
you
were
gonna
say.
Kentucky

was
ten
years
ago.
And?
And...
what
if
that
was

was?
If
it

OK.

But,
Ell,

Honey,
you're
not
gonna
have
to.
If
this
goes
sour
like
last
time.
I'll
take
Trevor
and
Ashley
-
Is
that
fair?
But
it's
not
gonna
go
sour.
Good.
Now
go
kick
some
arse.
What
the
hell?
Let's
do
this.
All
right.


Why
would
you
film
it?

Daddy,
I
can't
find
the

Come
here.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Thank
you,
Daddy.
Look
at
all
these
new

Thank
you.
Maybe
one
day

Then
I'll
be
famous
like
you.
-
All
right,
get
some
sleep.

And
Daddy?
Are
you
gonna

up
for
me,

right?
Look
at
the

-
Why
are
we
outside?
You
were
having
a
bad
dream,
OK?
-
Just
go
back
to
sleep.
It's
just
the
stress
of
the
move.
Poor
baby.
He'll
be
all
right
in
a
few
hours.
Oh.
Oh,
Tracy.
I...
What
is
it?
What's
the
matter?
I
wanna...
I
wanna
tell
you
something.
OK.
I'm
just
really
sorry.
It's
not
your
fault.
I
was
in
a
box?
-
You
were
in
a
box.
It's
not
the
strangest
place
Please
don't
talk
about
the
dryer.
Are
we
talking
about
the
time
we
found
-
God,
Mom,
no.
I
thought
that's
what
Did
Trevor
try
to
pee
-
Mom.
-
Is
that
like
a
bad
dream?
ASHLEY:
Oh,
I
think
I
had
one
of
those.
No,
a
night
terror
We
would
have
remembered
if
you
had
one.
So,
Ashley,
you
excited
-
What
about
you?
It's
nice
to
see
you're
both
-
Stop
it.
Be
the
bigger
person.
Yeah,
I've
got
some
errands
to
run.
I
figured
I'd
get
the
lay
of
the
land
-
Eat
up.
You're
running
late.
Grab
some
road
breakfast
and
skedaddle.
-
I
left
you
a
fresh
pot
of
coffee.
Have
a
nice
morning
-
Yes.
dear.
-
Trevor,
where's
your
notebook?
Can
you
see
it
in
there?

Oh,
fuck.
That's
it.
OK.

first
released
in
1966
OK.
Ah!

TRACY:
Trevor,
don't
walk
away
from
me.
Trevor,
what
on
earth
were
you
thinking?
TREVOR:
I'll
tell
you
again.
TRACY:
That's
your
problem.
You
wanna
be
treated
like
an
adult,
You
and
Dad
do
lots
of
thinking.
You
don't
know
-
I
know
more
than
you.
-
I
don't
wanna
see
you
until
dinner.
-
What
happened?
-
Your
son
is
acting
out
again.
-
You're
automatically
taking
her
side?
I
drew
a
picture.
A
picture
with
a
permanent
marker
-
Oh,
God.
Trevor?
-
I
drew
a
tree.
Go
to
your
room,
Trevor.
His
first
day
at

and
he's
already

What
did
he
hear?
That
your
book

Christ,
Ellison.
That's
not
enough?
Look,
I'm
sorry
he
had
to
find
out
But,
come
on,
it
was
bound
to
happen.
Really?
That's
your
response?
No,
it
doesn't
make
it
OK.
all
right?
Nothing
about
what
happened
But
bad
things
happen
to
good
people
and
they
still
need
-
They
deserve
that
much.
Oh,
come...
-
I'm
putting
the
kids
to
bed.

You're
getting
good
work
done?
Good.

you,
though.
The
bleeding's
stopped
for

or
if
there's
any
more
swelling,

Thank
you.
Appreciate
it.
-
This
way.
So
you
say
you
heard
a
loud
thump
after
the
power
went
out?
Yes.
-
But
the
ladder
wasn't
down?
It's
not
possible
to
close
it
No.
So
how
would
an
intruder
get
up
there?
I
didn't
say
anyone
was
up
there.
I
said

I
did
see
a
small
snake,
though.
You

I'm...
With,

spooked
from

sound

You
know
how
they
are.

I'm
not
really
a
squirrel

I
did
kill

maybe
I
should
get
an

you
very
much.
It's...

I
need
you
to

Just
wait
outside.
You

a
page
in
your
books
where
you
always
say
nice
things
about

The

Yeah,
and
in
each

there's
always

HOST:
Man,
I
got
into
this.
So
let
me
star?
by
asking
investigating
such
grisly
content?
Fame
and
money?
No,
I'm
just
kidding.
The
honest
answer
is
that
I'm
really
When
I
think
about
the
awful
things
and
that
those
responsible
were
never
I
mean,
I
knew
that
I
might
stumble
on
a
few
things
HOST:
Might?
No,
you
in
fact
did
that
the
cops
had
overlooked.
Well,
look,
first
off,
there
are
and
I
don't
wanna
in
any
way
But
in
police
work
getting
something
Good
crime
writing
can
set
things
right.
So,
ultimately,
what
feels
better?
Seeing

done

The
justice,
without
question.
I'd
rather
cut
my
hands
off

Are
you
making
Daddy
his
coffee?
Can
I
help?
I
wanna
bring
it
to
him.
Sure,
honey,
He's
very
particular
about
his
coffee.
-
Brought
you
your
coffee,
Daddy.

-
Yeah,
hello.
Hey,
Deputy
So
And
So.
I'm
sorry
to
get
back
to
you
I
couldn't
make
the
call
-
Yeah,
I
understand.
There
was
a
Martinez
family
that
died
in
their
garage
in
1979,
One
of
their
sons,
nine
years

St

That
is
excellent.

Yeah.
Does
that
mean

No,
no,
it
doesn't.
No.

Holy
shit.


Ashley?
Trevor?
Oh,
my
God.
Is
he
OK?
I
found
him
outside.
We
have
to
put
a
lock
on
his
door.
I'll
call
the
doctor
in
the
morning.
You
stay
with
him.


Good
dog.
Good
dog.
I
don't
wanna
hurt
you.
I
just
wanna
get
my
bat...
...so
if
you
come
at
me,
That's
fine.
You
keep
it.
-
You
OK?
Trevor's
too
old
He
was
supposed
-
He's
all
right.
He's
OK.
-
Stop
what?
We
can
pack
up,
get
out
of
town
Why,
'cause
he's
having
It's
more
than
that.
-
You've
never
been
this
bad.
You've
been
at
this
book
less
than
You
never
crack
into
the
whisky
-
You're
saying
I'm
a
drunk?
I'm
saying
there's
something
something
that's
eating
you
up,
and
it
-
Somethings
different
this
time.
-
How
much
do
you
wanna
know?
I'm
different
because
I've
never
Do
you
remember
how
it
was
-
I
remember.
I
am
talking
about
I'm
talking
about
a
mega
hit.
A
movie
deal,
talk
show
circuit,
right?
More
money
than
we
could...
-
I
don't
care
about
any
of
that.
-
I'm
just...
You're
just
what?
-
I'm
just
worried
about
you.
Then
why
did
you
come
in
Because
I
saw
a
dog,
OK?
-
A
dog?
I
mean,
I'd
never
seen
him
before.
-
Did
you
get
rid
of
him?
Listen,
I
just
need
I
promise
it's
worth
it.
Every
minute
that
we're
here,
we're
that
we
always
dreamed
of.
We're
almost
there.
OK?
-
Deputy.
I
had
a
few
of
the
pertinent
files
-
Really?
-
Thanks.
Do
you
think
I
could
come
in
Uh...
Yeah.
sure.
-
Thanks.
Look,
I...
Some
small-town
deputy
that's
starstruck
-
But
I'm
not
some
local
moron.
I
have
a
degree
in
criminology.
I've
taken
my
fair
share
I
also
know
a
series
of
connected
-
Look...
But
if
you
want
me
to
run
interference
I
gotta
be
in
the
loop
-
You
really
wanna
help?
What
happened
here
All
right.
Come
here.
Who
is
that?
I
don't
know.
-
You
think
these
are
serial
murders?
More
ritualized
than
necessarily
serial.
And
not
just
regionally
but
over
time.
-
The
1960s?
That
would
put
the
guy,
-
Yeah.
or
his
60s.
-
I
don't
know.
Toxicology
reports.
some
cases
-
With
what?
But
by
drugging
them,
the
killer
Here
he
used
a
tree
branch
In
Sacramento
he
lit
a
family
on
fire.
-
The
first
family
he
drowned.
You
never
said
anything
The
only
other
significant
link
is
that
in
each
instance
the

A
child
which
he
took
with
him.
That
and
this
symbol
appears
That
looks
like
something
Look'
you
might
wanna
There's
a
professor
over
there.
He's
an
occult
crime
expert
and
the
state
police
bring
him
in
I
think
this
qualifies.

So
where
do
you
think
That's
what
I
need
you
to
find
out.
OK.

-
Professor
Jonas?
Hello.
Hey,
thank
you
for
getting
back
Of
course,
I'm
a
really
big
fan.
Once
I
saw
the
photos
that
you
sent,
I
knew
exactly
Wait.
How
would
you
know
The
symbol
that
you
sent
me
is...
It's
not
something
or
a
Norwegian
black
metal
band
paint
-
Right.
No,
this
is
a
little
bit
more
obscure
I
know
the
one
in
the
hallway,
that's
from
the
late
'90s
in
St
Louis.
The
other
one,
the...
the
car
hood,
that
is
from
Sacramento,
Tell
me
about
the
one
in
Sacramento.
It's
a
symbol
associated
A
deity?
What
kind
of
deity?
A
very
obscure
one,
Named
Bughuul,
the
eater
of
children.
-
Did
you
say
eater?
The
crimes
that
you're
dealing
with.
They
all
have
the
element
Yes.
Yeah.
That's
correct.
Well,
Bughuul
eats
children.
Now,
the
fragments
of
stories
they
all
revolve
around
him
needing
Now,
each
story
involves
a
different
way
that
he
lures
or
tricks
these
children
and
traps
them
in
his
own
netherworld
and
he
consumes
their
souls
over
time.
Now,
any
worship
of
this
deity
or
the
wholesale
eating
of
a
child.
So
you're
saying
the
person
that
made
Well,
that
would
fit
the
stories.
Of
course,
the
few
times
none
of
the
crimes
have
been
related
So
this
might
be
rather
than,
you
know,
There's
been
another
one,
hasn't
there?
I
think
so,
yes.
Tell
me
everything
you
can.






Shh.
-
I
appreciate
you
coming
by,
Officer.
-
So
we're
becoming
friends.
right?
-
I
mean,
I
can
trust
you,
right?
So
if
I
were
to
ask
you
You
wouldn't
read
too
much
into
it?
Um...
All
right.
Was
there
anything...
weird
No
complaints
from
them
No,
not
to
my
knowledge.
The
investigators.
did
they
notice
about
the
house,
any...
No.
Mr
Oswalt.
is
there
something
Clearly
something
happened
and
you
wanna
Yeah.
OK,
well,
does
your
wife
Wait.
Does
she
know

Oh,
man.
Oh,
that
is
a
conversation
-
No,
me
neither.
So...
So,
what,
you
saw
something
weird,
-
Yes.
Precisely.
Now...
I
don't
believe
in
any,
you
know,
stuff.
Stuff?
You
mean
the
supernatural,
-
That
type
of
stuff?
Right.
Of
course
you
don't.
You
never
would
have
moved
But
here
we
are
Yeah,
but...
but
there
was...
there
was
none
of
that,
you
know,
No.
In
the
short
amount
of
time
they
never
called
the
police,
or
reported
anything
bizarre
-
Do
you
wanna
know
what
I
think?

I
think
that
you
moved
yourself
and
immediately
set
about
trying
I
also
think
that
you've
begun
that
go
to
darker
places
I
also
think
that
every
time
There's
a
whisky
bottle
-
No,
no,
no.
I...
I'm
not
saying
that
you
have
Nor
do
I
think
-
No!
What
I
do
think
is
that...
You've
put
yourself
That
your
mind
So
you
don't
believe
Are
you
kidding
me?
I...
I
wouldn't
sleep
one
night
Four
people
were
hung
by
their
necks
and
that
little
girl
-
OK.
You
should
try
and
get
out
more,
Total
honesty?
Last
night
...and
I
woke
up
on
the
couch
Well...
I
guess
if
I
thought
I'd
be
a
little
bit
freaked
out
too.
But,
listen,
Mr
Oswalt,
It's
just
gonna
do
TRACY:
Ellison!
-
Ellison!
Your
daughter
thought
there
wasn't
-
Ashley!
What
did
we
talk
about?
It
was
a
big
deal
for
us
-
What's
the
rule,
Ashley?
And
what
makes
you
think
I
wanted
to
paint
her
picture,
because
that
used
to
be
What?
Who
are
you
talking
about?
-
Stephanie.
She
used
to
live
here.
She's
the
one
Ashley,
go
to
your
room
What
the
hell
were
you
thinking?
Shh.
Of
course
I
knew
you
were
But
don't
blame
me
for
not
telling
you.
Don't
try
and
pin
this
on
me.
I
asked
you!
I
asked
you
You
asked
me
if
we
were
living
-
Don't
you
dare!
-
We
never
should
have
come
here!
It's
not
like
were
sleeping
or
they
had
to
wipe
blood
-
You're
saying
it
didn't
happen
here?
Oh,
that
is
so
sick!
-
It
does.
You
have
done
But
this
definitely
takes
the
cake.
My
God.
what
on
earth
-
We've
never
been
this
broke
before.
This
place
came
on
the
market.
Gee,
I
wonder
why.
So
what
Trevor
drew
last
week,
Yes.
The
previous
owners
of
this
home
-
Yes.
And
you
let
our
little
girl
Why
shouldn't
I?
Our
son
is
having
night
terrors
and
drawing
pictures
And
our
daughter
just
painted
She's
missing.
I
don't
wanna
hear
about
technicalities.
Do
you
understand
the
kind
of
jeopardy
you've
put
Yes,
I
do!
Is
there
anything
you
won't
do
Apparently
not.
-
It's
worth
it.
-
Risk
of
what?
Of
more
paintings?
My
daughter
has
a
father
who
loves
her,
who
is
always
around,
The
worst
thing
is
one
time
she
moved
into
a
house
She
found
out
about
the
murders,
So
she
painted
a
fucking
picture!
That's
what
she
does.
-
That's
it?
That's
all
you
have
to
say?
How
about
a
home
How
about
neighbours
that
don't
hate
us
in
a
town
where
I
can
buy
groceries
How
about
a
life
drawing
and
painting
the
sick
details
or
working
out
by
doing
bizarre
shit
in
the
night?
-
How
about
that?
Would
that
be
OK?
-
Just
when
I
finish
the
book!
Tracy,
don't
say
that.
That's
not
true.
It
is
true.
There
are
plenty
of
other
Doing
what?
Teaching?
Editing
journalism
textbooks?
Don't
you
understand
that
writing
These
books
are
my
legacy.
I
have
always
supported
you
But
writing
isn't
the
meaning
You
and
me,
right
here,
this
marriage'
And
your
legacy,
Your
kids
are
your
legacy.
-
Did
I
get
Daddy
in
trouble?
Your
daddy
got
Daddy
in
trouble.
-
I'm
sorry
I
painted
on
the
wall.
You

What
is
happening?

Shit.
Shit.

-
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
What's
the
matter?
What's
happened?
You
were
right.
I
made
a
mistake.
-
We
have
to
leave
now.
Get
the
kids,
pack
the
car.
Go!
-
Honey,
slow
down.
I
wanna
put
as
much

OK.
-
Where
are
we
going,
Daddy?
-
Home,
home,
like
you
promised?
What
about
our
stuff?
We're
gonna
call
the
movers
It's
OK.
-
Evening,
Oswalts.
-
Licence
and
registration.
Driving
pretty
fast
Anything
I
ought
to
know
about?
Just
trying
to
take
your
advice,
-
Which
advice
would
that
be?
-
You
weren't
bullied
away
or
anything?
What
I
mean
is,
I
don't
wanna
be
that
angry
town
folks
If
you've
been
mistreated,
There
isn't
gonna
be
any
book.
No
book?
No,
sir.
Well.
then.
I
don't
see
any
reason
Just
one
more
favour.
Hold
it
under
60
Until
you're
somebody
else's
problem.
Yes,
sir.
Did
you
mean
that?
About
the
book?
Yeah.
You
promise?
I
promise.
Let's
go
home.

This
goes
in
the
office,

Hey,
Ell,
10
bucks
says
No,
I'm
not
taking
that
bet.


Mr
Oswalt,
sorry
it
took
so
long
There's
been
that
no
one
has
actually
bothered
-
Well,
what
am
I
looking
at?
An
old
sketch
from
the
Dark
Ages.
There
isn't
a
lot
left.
-
Why?
Early
Christians
believed
that
Bughuul
and
that
they
were
gateways
-
Gateways?
The
ancient
Church
believed
of
those
who
saw
the
images
or
in
some
cases
he
could
even
abduct
Children
exposed
to
the
images
were
especially
vulnerable
to
-
What
if
you
destroyed
'em?
If
you
destroyed
the
images
with
a
fire,
What,
do
you
mean
literally
In
the
stories
then
the
gateway
would
be
closed
and
Bughuul
would
no
longer
Mr
Oswalt,
what
kind
of
book
I
don't
know.
I'm
not
even
sure
-
But
thank
you
for
your
time.

All
right.

-
You
know
what
time
it
is?
But
I've
been
trying
-
What's
the
problem?
How
is
that
a
problem?
I
was
compiling
all
of
the
data
and
once
I
started
putting
it
together
I
saw
the
connection,
it
was
obvious.
-
What
was
it?
Each
family
that
you
had
me
look
up
had
previously
lived
in
the
house
where
Each
family?
All
five
of
them?
Yes,
and
when
you
put
them
you
can
actually
draw
a
line
OK,
we
knew
in
the
same
St
Louis
house
Before
the
Miller
family
was
killed,
the
Millers
lived
in
the
same
house
where
the
De
Luzio
Guess
where
the
De
Luzios
lived
Sacramento
where
the
Martinez
family
Exactly.
The
pattern
goes
back
Listen,
Mr
Oswalt,
you
just
moved
out
If
this
guy
is
still
out
there,
you
not
only
just
sped
up
his
timeline,
Thanks,
Deputy.
Stephanie.
It's
the
missing
kids.

I
like
that
you
made
the
movies
longer.
