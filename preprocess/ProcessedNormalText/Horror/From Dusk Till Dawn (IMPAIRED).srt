a
question,
Now
are
you

we
say
If
you
don't...
Rule
number
three:
Don't

I
got
six
little
friends

-

Gloria,

Take
off
your
shoes.

You
got
about...
until
we
get
into
El
Paso,
which
is
right
next
-
Then
we'll
stop
at
a
motel.
-
We're
not
actually
gonna
stop
We
have
a
motor
home.
-

We're
self-contained.
Maybe
I
was...
a
little
overzealous.
-
How
come
you
wanna
stop
anyways,
Dad?
Exhausted?
Just
lie
in
the
back,
Dad.
-
I
just
bet
you
would.
Besides,
I
wanna
have...
just
one
night's
sleep
The
beds
in
the
home
they're
not
like
a
real
bed.
Excuse
me.
Oh,
guess
what?
When
I
called
um,
one
of
them
And
Mr.
Franklin
he
wouldn't
permanently
replace
you
-
And
he
said
that--
But
I'll
call
him
tomorrow
Daddy,
I
didn't
wanna
in

of
Scott
But
I
just
wanna
know...
don't

believe
Not
enough
to
be
a
pastor.

your
question,
Yes,
I
do
believe
in
God.
But
do
I
love
Them?
No.
Well,
it's
just
that
all
our
lives,
And
then...
one
day
you're
just
gonna

Many,
many
times
during
your
life
you'll
and
ask
yourself,
"Am
I
a
fool?"
I'm
not
going
through
a
lapse.
What
I've
experienced
Daddy?
What
do
you
think
Mama's
got
nothin'
to
say.
This
bloody
crime
spree
started
The

loss
of
life
that
the
Bureau,
the
Rangers
I
would
say
that's

Shit,
I
was

Did
you
see
the
border?

What'd
the
TV
say?
I
gotta
figure
out
a
way
The

Before
you
flip
out,
okay,
let
I
need
an
explanation.
There's
nothing
wrong
with
me,
No,

woman
wouldn't
have
said
shit
Wrong,

Is
it
me?

It's
not
your
fault.

No,
it's
her
fault.
Do
you
think
that

I
don't.
I
don't
kill
people
that
I
don't
have
What
you
are
doing--
What
you
are
doing
is
not
how
it's
done.
Just

There's
nothin'
wrong

It's
not
a
flophouse.
It's
basic
and
it's
simple.
That
doesn't
make
it
All
