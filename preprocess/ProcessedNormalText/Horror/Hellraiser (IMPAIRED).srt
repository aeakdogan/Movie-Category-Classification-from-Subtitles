MAN:
The
box.

Take
it,
it's
yours.
It
always
was.

MAN:
It's
gotta
be
one
of
these.
JULIA:
-
Okay,
okay.
Like
who?
Well,
I
don't
know.
Ah.
Success.
Voila.
Well,
this
is
it...
the
old
homestead.
Yuck.
It
smells
damp.
Well,
it's...
been
empty
But
we'll
soon
warm
it
up
and
get
it
feeling
like
a
home.
How
long
since
you
were
here?
Oh,
the
better
part
of
10
years.
I
wanted
to
sell
it
after
but
I
couldn't
get
Frank
to
agree.
I
guess
he
needed
a
Would
you
look
at
this?
And
don't
worry,
this
stuff
means
nothing
to
me.
It
all
goes.
I
thought
half
of
it
I've
never
known
him
to
kick
He's
probably
behind
You
know...
We
have
to
let
Kirsty
before
we
do
a
thing
to
it.
She'll
love
it.
You
really
want
to
move
in
here?
You
don't
like
it?
I
suppose
it's
better
Oh,
don't
start,
Julia.
-
Don't
start
what?
We
can
make
it
work
here.
Now
I've
got
a
terrific
job,
you're
back
on
your
own
turf...
We
can
be
happy.
-
All
right,
all
right.
-
No
argument.
MAN:
Honey...

Shit.

Larry!
Larry!
-
Where
are
you?
Squatters?
Frank.
-
He's
here?
I
mean,
there's
stuff
in
the
He's
obviously
made
one

What
the
hell
is
that?
-
Who
is
this?
-
Kirsty!
-
Barely.
Where
are
you?
-
You
what?
Wait,
I
thought
you
-
with
us
for
a
while.
Well,
you'd
like
this
house.
You'd
like
my
room.
I'd
really
like
you
to
see
Maybe
in
the
next
couple
of
days.
What
for,
sweetie?
Look,
you've
already
made
the
dad,
this
isn't
a
gesture.
Come
on
and
trust
-
Call
me
tomorrow.
Bye,
dad.
So?
Why
not?
Great.
We'll
move
in
on
Sunday.
LARRY:
Listen,
look
out
for
the
-
LARRY:
All
right.
-
LARRY:
Are
you
all
right
back
there?
LARRY:
straight
up
the
stairs.
Don't
worry,
it'll
get
through.
-
All
right.
What's
the
matter?
-
LARRY:
All
right,
all
right.
-
MAN:
Watch
it.
Let's
take
five,
guys.
How's
things
in
there?
-
Looks
like
a
bomb
dropped.
There's
some
in
the
fridge.
Oh,
well...
Why
don't
I
get
it?
I've
got
nothing
better
to
do.
Excuse
me.
-
My
lucky
day.
-
Do
you
wanna
buy
a
bed?
Dad?
-
LARRY:
Kirsty!
Hello,
sweetie.
Come
here.
-
Here
you
go.
This
is
a
big
house.
-
You
like?
Me
like.
I'll
give
you
the
grand
tour
if
we
-
Is
Julia
here?
Look,
be
gentle
with
her,
okay?
-
She
hates
moving.
-
Kirsty.
You
get
on
with
the
grunt
work
-
and
I'll
make
myself
some
coffee.
-
There's
the
kitchen.
Bye.
-
Is
that
your
daughter?
-
Got
her
mother's
looks.
Oh.

Come
on.
Oh,
shit.
FRANK:
Can
I
come
in?
Can
I
come
in?
-
You're
Julia,
right?
Who
are
you?
I'm
Frank.
I'm
brother
Frank.
Oh,
yes!
I...
I
came
for
the
wedding.
Well,
can
I
come
in
or
not?
I'm
sorry.
Of
course.
You're
very
welcome.
Yeah.
Well,
that's
nice
to
know.
Do
you
have
a
towel?
KIRSTY:
Have
you
got
a
towel?
Kirsty.
There's
one
in
the
bathroom.
Oh,
by
the
way,
did
daddy
It's
not
that
big,
but
it's
okay.
Julia?
-
Julia?

FRANK:
What
shall
we
drink
to?
Wedded
bliss?
I'm
very
happy.
I'm
sure
you
are.
You're
gonna
let
me
kiss
the
bride?
JULIA'S
VOICE:
What
about
Larry?
Forget
him.


I
need
to...
take
the
weight
-
You
got
it?
Now
just
push
it
to
me
as
I
pull.


It's
never
enough.
Julia.
Jul...
Please.
I'll
do
anything
you
want.

Anything.
Here.
Oh,
is
it
deep?
I
don't
know.
I
haven't
looked.
You
know
me
and
blood.
-
I'm
gonna
faint.
Oh,
shit!
-
L...
le...
let
me
see.
Oh,
it's
going
to
need
stitches.
-
I'm
gonna
throw
up.
-
Just
take
it
easy,
just
take
it
easy.
-
It's
going
to
be
all
right.
Let's
get
you
to
the
hospital.
-
LARRY:
So
stupid.
What
happened?
It
was
just
an
accident.
Look,
will
you
drive?
-
Yeah,
sure.
-
So
stupid.
LARRY:
So
stupid.



-

This
doctor
is
poking
around
with
all
the
delicacy
and
and
I'm
warning
him,
"listen,
He
says,
"oh
no,
of
course
you're
not
The
next
thing
you
know,
and
he's
standing
there
like
MAN:
He
probably
is
afraid
I
should
do
it!
Bill,
I
should
do
it.
I'll
call
you
tomorrow.

-
Doctors.
LARRY:
And
what's
my
JULIA:
I
don't
remember.
Listen,
Julia,
Uh
no.
No
more
for
me,
thanks.
Okay.
Okay,
stop.
-
I'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
stand
up.

Would
you
all
excuse
me?
I
think
I'm
going
to
go
to
bed.
-
Are
you
all
right,
darling?
I
think
we
ought
to
LARRY:
No...
bill!
Absolutely
not!
This
is
the
night
of
We're
celebrating
Good
night.
You'll
have
to
come
to
us
next.
WOMAN:
Yeah,
real
soon.
Thank
you.
-
Good
night.
-
WOMAN:
Does
it
still
hurt?
Oh.
No,
only
when
I
drink.
-






Oh,
God.
Oh!
Christ!

Julia.
Oh
my
God.
Don't
look
at
me.
Who...
who
are
you?
I
said
don't
look.
Help
me!
Tell
me
who
you
are.
Frank.
No.
No!
Believe
me,
it's
me.
It's
really
me.
His
blood
on
the
floor,
it
brought
me
back.
Back?
From
where?
Just
help
me,
will
you?
Please,
God,
help
me!

-
Somebody...
You
can't
leave
me
like
this.
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
The
blood
brought
me
this
far.
I
need
more.

You
have
to
heal
me.
Hi.
Are
you
all
right?
MAN:
No,
I'm
here.
Good
night.
So
why
didn't
you
stay
There's
plenty
of
room.
Oh,
yeah,
there's
room,
-
Ah.
I
see.
She's
like
you.
Oh,
yeah?
Meaning
what?
Oh,
I
don't
know.
I
beg
your
pardon.
See,
there
you
go.
Hey,
we're
not
all
frigid.
-
Oh,
no?
Oh,
no?
Oh,
no.
That's
not
what
I
heard.
Well,
you
must
have
been


Anything?
Anything.
You'll
do
it?
Yes...
I
will.



Kirsty?
Kirsty?
-
Kirsty!
-
You
all
right?
I-I
don't
know.
I-I
was
dreaming.
Daddy!

Hello.
I'm
all
right,
honey.
I
just
wanted
to
make
Never
better.
-
Now
you
sleep
well,
okay?
I
love
you,
sweetie.
I
love
you
too,
daddy.
Bye.
-
JULIA:
Who
was
it?
-
Who?
Kirsty.
-
Not
much
fun,
is
it?
Drinking
alone.
Not
much.
I
thought
maybe...
Well...
If
we're
both
on
our
own,
maybe
Why
not?
You
know,
it's
not
often
that
I...
You
know.
There's
a
first
time
That's
right,
yeah.
I
suppose
that's
right.
Would
you...
like
a
drink?
Oh,
no
no
no.
I'm
well
over
my
limit.
You
know,
it's
funny,
but
I...
I
feel
like
I've
known
What's
the
matter?
It's
what
you
brought
Well,
isn't
it?
I
suppose
so,
yes.
So
what's
your
problem?
Let's
get
on
with
it.
You're
not
gonna
change
I'm
sorry.
Let's
go
upstairs.
Okay
okay.
Sorry,
okay?
Okay.
-
Right.
This
isn't
the
bedroom.
No.
So
what's
going
on?
We
don't
need
a
bed,
do
we?
Well,
no,
I
suppose
not.
I've
always
preferred
the
floor.
Oh.
First
time
for
everything,
eh?
Why
don't
you...
Take
your
jacket
off?
Yeah,
why
don't
I?
Why
don't
you
do
the
same
thing?
Maybe
I
will.

You're
very
beautiful.
Am
I?
Oh,
you
know
you
are.
Loveliest
woman...
I've
ever
seen.
Oh,
Christ.
What's
wrong?
Just
one
minute.
Too
much
drink.
Empty
the
old
bladder.


Did
you
lock
this?
Please!
Please!
FRANK:
Don't
look
at
me.

Jesus
Christ.
Ah!
See?
It's
making
me
whole
again.
Every
drop
of
blood
you
spill
puts
more
flesh
on
my
bones.
And
we
both
want
that,
don't
we?
-
Uh...
Come
here.
Come
here,
damn
you,
Come
to
daddy.
-


Julia.
Come
out,
come
out,

Julia,
I
was
calling
for
you.
Are
you
in
there?

I'm
feeling
sick.
Oh,
babe.
Is
there
Maybe
a...
a
Brandy.
It's
coming
right
up.
I'll
be
down...
in
a
minute.
Okay.
There's
no
hurry.


Frank?

-
Oh.
Hurting?
My
nerves
are
beginning
Good.
One
more,
maybe
two...
-
Not
again.
Then
we
can
be
away
from
here
-
Who?
It's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
I
must
get
away
from
here.
LARRY:
Julia?
Are
you
all
right?
Just
a
moment.
Put
on
some
music.
Will
you,
babe?
LARRY:
Yeah,
sure.
Poor
Larry,
obedient
as
ever.

Don't
want
"babe"
to
hear.
You're
hurting.
You
won't
cheat
me,
will
you?
You'll
stay
with
me,
help
me.
Then
we
can
be
together
We
belong
to
each
other
now.
For
better,
for
worse.
Like
love...
Only
real.

I'm
sorry...
I'm
new
here.
Could
you
not
do
that?
Please!
Where's
the
manager?
That's
a
problem
too,
because
I
want
to
see
somebody
in
charge.
Then
you're
gonna
have
to
wait.
-
Excuse
me.
What
are
you
doing?
Give
those
back.
-

Get
out.
You
get
out
of
here.

-

Hi.
Just
came
by
to
see
what
What's
wrong?
-
Something
weird.

Nothing.
You're
sure
we're
not
Quite
sure.
Only
I...
uh...
I
like
to
be
careful.


I
can
taste
that.
It's
a
long
time
since
You
promised
me
an
explanation.
This
is
it.
-
Let
me
see.
It's
dangerous.
It
opens
doors.
What
kind
of
doors?
Doors
to
the
pleasures
I
didn't
care
which.
I
thought
I'd
gone
to
the
limits.
I
hadn't.
The
Cenobites
gave
me
an
experience
beyond
limits.
Pain
and
pleasure...
Indivisible.



-


They
won't
get
me
back.
I'm
going
to
live
and
you're
Yes.
They'll
never
find
us,
not
in
the
whole
wide
world.
ANNOUNCER:
Boom
boom
has
got
him.
He's
knocked
down
again.
I
thought
this
kind
of
-

Moran's
getting
back
up.
Are
you
all
right?
Fine.
-
No.
No...
If
you
feel
like.
Get
him!
Get
him!
-

What
was
that?
I
think
I
left
a
-
I'll
go
see.
It
was
nothing.
Larry!
What's
the
matter
with
you
anyway?
It's
just
that
I
hate
the
thunder.
I'm
here.
You're
safe.
You're
trembling.
There's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
Look.
I
really
should
check
it
out.
Don't
go
up
there,
please.
We'll
both
go
up.
Come
on.
-
Larry,
please!
-
Don't.

It's
probably
a
rat.
I
told
you.
There's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
Let's
go
downstairs.
No,
this
is
enough
light.

Let's
go,
come
on.
Let's
go
inside.
Oh,
yes.

Yes.
Yes.



No.
No!
No,
please
don't.
No,
please!
I
can't
bear
it,
please!
Please,
no!
Please!
Please
stop!
I
can't
bear
it!
Please,
no!
I
don't
understand
you.
I
mean,
one
minute...
You're
all
over
me,
and
the
next...
I
just
don't
understand
you.
I
don't
know.
Maybe
we
shouldn't
have
come
back.
Brooklyn
certainly
wasn't
Look.
You
love
her,
so
there
must
I
wish
it
were
that
simple.
I've
got
a
real
She
doesn't
even
want
Really?
It's
like
she's...
-
Waiting
for
something.
I
don't
know.
I
don't
know.
It's
way
beyond
me.
Look.
Could
you...
would
you...
Uh-oh.
stop
by
sometime?
Try
to
make
friends?
Sure.
Who
knows,
maybe
all
she
needs
is
somebody
to
talk
to.
-
You
can't
love
him.
-
So
where's
the
harm?
Then
find
me
somebody
else,
Now!

I...
I
get
lonely
sometimes.

Everybody
does.

Come
in.
What
is
this,
a
game?
Jesus
Christ!

Oh,
Christ!
Help
me!
Don't!
-
Get
out
of
here!
-
Don't
let
him
kill
me.




Help
me.

No.
-
Kirsty,
it's
Frank.
It's
Uncle
Frank.
-
You
remember.
-
Come
to
daddy.
You've
grown.
You're
beautiful.
Don't...
don't
touch
me!
Don't
touch
me
or
so
help
me
I...
what
will
you
do?
What
can
you
do?
There's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
I
bet
you
make
your
daddy
so
proud.
Don't
you,
beautiful?
-
This
isn't
happening.
Used
to
try
and
pretend
I
But
don't
you
kid
yourself.
Some
things
have
to
be
endured,
and
that's
what
makes
the
-


No!
No!
Give
me
that!
-
No.
You
want
it?
One
last
time:
Give
me
that
box.
-
You
want
it?
You
want
it?
Fucking
have
it!
No!
-


Come
to
daddy.




It's
Uncle
Frank.
Are
you
all
right?
You're
awake.
-
Good
girl.
-
I'll
get
the
doctor.
I
won't
be
a
moment.
Please,
get
back
into
bed.
I
have
to
call
my
father.
That's
easily
arranged,
It's
important.
It
really
is...
first
things
first.
We'll
get
you
a
telephone
What
about
this?
Ring
any
bells?
You
were
hanging
onto
I
don't
remember.
Well,
the
police
will
-
You
know
that.
In
the
meantime,
maybe
this
Shit.







Open!

Oh,
come
on!

The
box.
You
opened
it,
we
came.
It's
just
a
puzzle
box!
Oh,
no.
It
is
a
means
to
summon
us.
Who
are
you?
Explorers
in
the
further
Demons
to
some,
angels
to
others.
It
was
a
mistake!
I
didn't...
It
was
a
mistake!
You
can
all...
Go
to
hell!
-
We
can't.
Not
alone.
we
came,
now
you
must
come
with
us.
-
Taste
our
pleasures.
Please,
go
away
and
leave
me
alone!
Oh,
no
tears,
please.
It's
a
waste
of
good
suffering.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Please,
wait!
No
time
for
argument.
You've
done
this
before,
right?
PINHEAD:
Many
many
times.
To
a
man
called
Frank
Cotton?
Oh,
yes.
He
escaped
you.
Nobody
escapes
us.
He
did.
I've
seen
him.
-
WOMAN:

Impossible.
Supposing
he
had
escaped
us.
What
has
that
to
do
with
you?
I...
I
can...
and
you
can
take
him
Perhaps
we
prefer
you.
I
want
to
hear
him
confess
himself,
then
maybe...
Maybe.
But
if
you
cheat
us...
We'll
tear
your
soul
apart.
She'll
tell
them
everything.
I
don't
think
so.
-

-
Or
the
police.
Don't
you
care?
What
I
care
about
is
a
new
skin.
Maybe
we
should
just
leave.
Like
this?
Look
at
me.
We
can't
just
stay
here.
My
brother
will
be
home
soon.
What
is
it?
I
don't
know
where
to
begin.
What
are
you
talking
about?
It's
best
you
see
for
yourself.
NURSE:
I
even
locked
the
door.
STEVE:
Well,
she's
not
here
now.
I'll
start
looking
for
her.
Maybe
she's
gone
back
to...
To
her
father's
house.

Daddy?
Daddy,
it's
me,
Daddy,
let
me
in!
-
Kirsty?
It's
very
late.
-
What's
the
matter?
Of
course.
-

KIRSTY:
Where
is
he?
Where
is
he?
-

Daddy?
-
Daddy,
you're
okay.
You're
all
right.
-
You're
okay!
I
was
so
afraid
that
I
know,
I
know.
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Yeah.
Of
course.
It's
okay,
baby,
Oh,
no,
see...
Your
brother
Frank
is
upstairs.
He's
upstairs
and
he's
-
He's
gonna
kill
you!
Whatever
Frank
did
was
unspeakable.
Unspeakable.
But
believe
me,
it's
finished
with
now.
Why
is
it
finished?
He's
gone.
What
does
"gone"
mean?
He's
dead,
Kirsty.
He
was
insane,
baby,
a
mad
dog.
I
had
to
put
Jesus,
what
a
scene.
And
when
I'm
feeling
better,
I'll
go
to
the
police
and
try
God
knows...
I
don't
really
understand
myself.
Did
he
hurt
you,
baby?
No,
I'm
okay.
He's
better
off
dead.
Poor
Frank.
I
don't
believe
this.
-
I
don't
believe
this.
I
need
to
see
him.
-
No,
you
don't.
Yes.
Show
her.


We
want
the
man
who
did
this.
No.
No,
that
wasn't
the
deal.
He's
my
father
and
No!
Ah!
Move.
Kirsty...
Move!
What's
the
matter?
There's
no
time.
Wait,
no
wait.
I
told
you
No,
it's
not!
No,
stay
with
us.
We
can
all
be
happy
here.
No.
Come
to
daddy.
Oh
my
God!
Come...
To
daddy.
-
Ah!

Well...
So
much
for
the
cat-
No!
Not
me!
It's
nothing
personal,
baby.
Where
are
you,
beautiful?
Come
out,
come
out,




Oh
no.
Oh
my
God.
Daddy.
Daddy.
No,
don't
mourn
him.
He
was
dead
long
before
-
Bastard!
Everything's
all
right.
-
Frank's
here.
Your
dear
old
Uncle
Frank.
-

What
the
hell
is
that?



Frank.
No!
We
had
to
hear
it
This
isn't
for
your
eyes.
You
set
me
up,
bitch!


"Jesus
wept."
Not
leaving
us
so
soon,
are
you?

Ah!

We
have
such
sights
to
show
you.
Oh,
shit.
-
No!
Don't
do
that!



Kirsty!
Kirsty!

No.
Steve.
No!
Oh,
shit!
Oh,
Kirsty!
Thank
God
you're
okay.
Let's
get
the
hell
out
of
here!
Oh,
no.
Oh,
God.
No.
Open!
Steve!
No!







-
What's
your
pleasure,
sir?
