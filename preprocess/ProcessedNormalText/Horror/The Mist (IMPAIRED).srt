a
list.
I'll

the
store
Fuck.

Can

it?
No,
I

I'll

they
can
extend
my
deadline.
STEPHANIE:

You

They
could
whip
up
some
bad
They
do
it
all
the
time.
I
should
have
brought
it
downstairs
Just
stupid,
I
guess.
Well,
sweetie,
that
a
tree
was
gonna
come
flying
Yeah,
I'll
hit
the
hardware
store
too,
get
some
plastic
sheeting
and
seal
this
up
Order
in
some
new
glass.
Oh,
you
know
what?
that
was
your
grandfather's
tree,
-
Ohh.
It's
just
stuff,
though.
You
know,
we're
safe.
Yeah.
Mom,
Dad,
you
gotta
come
see!
Hey,
Billy,

it
easy,
I
really
don't
want

all
bashed!
Billy.
Sorry,
Mom,

Whoa.
Having
spoken,

BILLY:
Come
on!
How
do
you
two
always
manage

You
have
incredibly
low
standards.
Let's
go,
uh,
see
the
damage.
No.
-
Norton's
tree.
You
mean
the
dead
one
to
take
down
for
three
years
That
tree?
-
Really
got
smooshed.
Look
at
that.
What
is
it,
Daddy?
Mist.
-
On
the
lake?
Coming
off
the
mountain
like
that?
Two
fronts
meeting,
left
over
from
the
storm,
You
sure?
Honey,
I'm
not
the
weatherman.
Why
don't
you
take
Billy,
I'll
take
him
to
town
with
me.
Okay.
Where

going?
I'm
gonna
go
have
a
little
chat
Hon.
Don't
worry,
I'm
not
gonna
You
know
what
he's
gonna
say.
He's
gonna
say,
"Sue
me,"
Honey,
one
property
dispute
is
enough
to
last
me
a
lifetime.
I'm
gonna
ask
Okay.

That's
all.

NORTON:
Ohh!
Aw,

Ohh,

fucker!
Cock

"Full

Pull

I
guess
you've

Yeah,

Nothin'.
Just
think
we
should
trade
That's
all.

Oh,

NORTON:

I'm
sorry,
man.
I
mean
it.
Sincerely.
-
That's
nice
of
you
to
say.
I
hate
to
see
it
like
that.
Okay,
I'll
tell
you
what,
I'll
find
my
insurance
guy's
number,
-
That
okay?
So,
uh,
David--
you're
not
heading
into
town
today
DAVID:
Maybe
we'll
get
our
power
back.
NORTON:
One
for
the
books,
yeah.
For
a
moment
there
last
night,
I
thought
we
were
gonna
take
off
WZON
is
off
the
air,
but
Portland's
still
broadcasting.
Daddy,
look.
Ah.
Guys
from
the
base.
-
From
up
the
mountain?
The
Arrowhead
Project?
Well,
you're
a
local.
Any
idea
what
they
do
up
there?
Missile
defense
research.
You
know,
I'm
sure
Oh,
sure.
The

the
Laundromat

crashed
flying
saucer
Right.
Miss
Edna.
Yeah.
Miss
Tabloid.
"I
Had
Bigfoot's
Baby."
"Satan's
Face
Appears
You
know,
real
reliable
stuff.
DAVID:
Well,
they're
in
a
hurry.
Maybe
their
power's
out
too.
Huh.
Still
no
signal.
Why
don't
you
go
ahead?
Can
I
go
with
Mr.
Norton,
Daddy?
Sure,
if
you
promise
-
BILLY:
Yeah.
Here's
a
list.
-
Sure.
Meet
you
guys
in
there.
Hold
hands.
MAN:
I'm
sorry.

know

(clicks

BOY:
That

so
freaky!
Hmm.

Sally,

You
guys
look
jammed
up.
Yeah,
well,
half
the
staff
Oh,
no.
What,
Only

keep
the
food
cold.
Everything
else,
and
bring
your
checkbook.
Hey,
Thursday
night,
-
Baby-sit?
Oh,
my
God.
OLLIE:

Everybody's
stockin'
up.
Crappy
day,
huh?
Eh,
everyone's
a
little
'Morning,
Mrs.
Carmody.
With
lines
like
these,
but
I
guess
we'll
have
to
make
do.
-
Keep
your
head
down,
pal.
Hey,
champ.
Your
wife
should
be
a
doctor.
She
could
make
a
fortune
Yeah,
it
takes
some
getting
used
to.
Why
don't
you
get
your
stuff?
Okay,
done.
Hey,
David,
Are
you
and
Mr.
Norton
Oh,
I
don't
know.
"Friends"
might
be
stretching
it
a
little.
I
guess
you're
not
mad
I
guess
not.
And
that's
a
start,
huh?
BUD:
I'm
sorry,
ma'am,
The
power
outage
got
us
too.
Hopefully
we'll
have

The

minutes.
You

the
goodies.

BUD:
I
need
some
change
Good
morning,
Ms.
Reppler.
BILLY:
Hello,
Ms.
Reppler.
Well,
hello
to
you,
Billy
Drayton.
How'd
you
hold
up
in
the
storm?
We
had
a
tree
come
through
right
in
my
studio.
And
the
boathouse
got
all
smooshed.
IRENE:
Ouch.
-
Yeah.
DAVID:
HATTIE:
Oh,
we're
fine.
At
the
very
least,
I'll
bet
every
one
IRENE:
We
had
damage
That's
what
we
get
for
not
fixing
but
with
funds
being
cut
every
year...
You'd
think
educating
children
would
be
more
but
you'd
be
wrong.
Government's
got
better
things
like
corporate
handouts


Daddy,
is
there
a
fire?
I'm
sure
she's
fine.
Mind
what
you're
doing,
Sally.
SOLDIER:
Oh,
come
on,
Check
our
papers.
Look,
I
told
you,
I
don't
know
why.
I
gotta
go
check
the
pharmacy
out.
Three
men
meet
me
That's
an
order.
Shit,
man!
Another
half
an
hour,


Oh,
my
God!
Something
in
the
mist!
-

...took
John
Lee!
Dan,
catch
your
breath.
Something
in
the
mist
took
John
Lee.
I
could
hear
him
screaming.
Shut
the
doors!
Shut
the
doors!
Daddy,
I'm
scared.

DAN:
Don't
go
out
there.
There's
something
in
the
mist.
MAN:
Screw
that!
Mister,
no!




Please
hold
me.
-

CORNELL:
It's
a
pollution
cloud.
Some
kind
of
chemical
explosion.
MAN:

What's
going
on?
It's
death.
Aah!




-

BILLY:
Daddy!



MAN:


That
was
an
earthquake.
I
tell
you,
the
goddamn
mills
blew
up!
OLLIE:
Is
everyone
okay?
Everybody
just
stay
put,
okay?
I
can't.
I
can't
stay
here.
MRS.
CARMODY:
No.
It's
death
out
there.
Stop
it,
okay?
Stop
it.
NORTON:
Please,
everybody,
He's
right.
Let's
just
stay
cool.
Let's
just
try
to
figure
out
I'm
sorry,
I--
I
can't
just
stay
here.
Ma'am,
no,
you
can't
go
out
there.
Could
be
a
poisonous
gas
cloud.
Didn't
you
hear
that
man
screaming?
I
agree.
Let's
stay
here
WOMAN:
You're
not
listening!
I
can't
stay
here.
Wanda's
looking
after
little
Victor.
Sometimes
she
forgets
I
told
them
I'd
only
be
gone
She's
only
8.
For
their
sakes,
don't.
Well,
isn't
anybody
gonna
help
me?
DAVID:

Won't
somebody
here
You?
You?
-
DAVID:

It's
okay,
buddy.
Ma'am,
please,
I
hope
you
all
rot
in
hell.
OLLIE:

BUD:
Okay,
Get

spilled
bottles,

supplies.

All
right,
easy,
champ.
Come

Come

Can't
keep
crying
like
this,
pal.
Come
on!
Come
on,
-
Come
on,
are
you
all
right?
All
right,
I
know
you
want
Mommy.

Just
try
to
breathe,
okay?

Just
try
to
breathe,
pal.

I
haven't
seen

suck
his
thumb
AMANDA:
He's
in
shock.
I
think
we
all
are.
IRENE:
You
haven't
met.
Amanda
Dunfrey.
She's
new
in
town
Teaches
third
grade
and
the
special
ed
kids,
She's
wonderful.
And
David's
an
artist.
He

movie
posters
and
such.
And
me...
Lord,
I'm
babbling
away
My
nerves
are
jangled,
I
guess.
Boy

down?
How
is
he?
Still
hot.
Why
don't
I
get
him
some
aspirin.
-
Aisle
three.
Thanks.
DAVID:
How's
Dan?
His
nose
stopped
bleedin'.
He's
calmer
now.
Can't
believe
the
way
he
ran
in
here.
Never
seen
him
like
that.
I
need
something
to
cover
my
boy
up.
Furniture
pads.
Loadin'
dock.
Gonna
keep
checkin'
on
people.
You
bet.
Sally,
you
mind?
Oh,
I'd
love
to.
I
really
should

I'll
take
him.
Daddy,
don't
go.
No,
I'll
be
gone
two
seconds,
Big
Bill.
Mrs.
Reppler's

Mrs.
Turman.
I'll

close
by,
okay?
-
Okay.
Let
me
look
at
you.
Hmm?
HATTIE:
Wanna
lie
down?
Yeah.
There
you
go.
NORTON:
Soon
as
it
blows
away,
but
we
have
to
be
smart
about
it.
First
thing
we
need
to
do
and
find
out
what's
happened.
MAN:
Well,
Howe
gonna
We've
got
no
phone
signal,
NORTON:
I'm
sure
they're
working
It
stands
to
reason
would
be
their
top
priority.




Oh,
shit.
-

Shit!

God
damn
it!
Ow!
Ow!
Bitch!
NORTON:
It's
obvious
that
we're--
we're
in
some
kind
MAN:
Ain't
nothin'
obvious
CORNELL:
There
ain't
nothin'
MAN:
That's
right.

Day,
There
is
nothing
more
obvious

and
dissolution.

No,

N-nobody

heard
that
sound?
I
don't
know,
like
a...
weird
noise,

in
the
dark.
Like

Did

No,

After,

MYRON:
Okay,
I'll

Get

Go

Don't

to
anybody.
Not

Not
yet.


OLLIE:

David?
Need
a
little
light
here.
We
have
to
tell
'em.
The
people
in
the
market,
They
won't
believe
us.
They
have
to.
I'm
not
sure
I
believe
it.
W-what
we
saw
was
impossible.
You
know
that,
don't
you?
I
mean,
what--
what
do
we
say?
How
do
we
convince
them?
Ollie,

DAVID:
Shh!
Yeah,

W-what
the
hell
happened?
I'll
explain.
Give
me
a
minute,
okay?
I
need
to
deal
with
something
first.
Please,
I've
got
to--
I
can't
let
Billy
see
me
like
this.
Just
give
me
a
minute.
Okay.
JIM:
Hey,
look,
Me
too.
I
mean,
I
ain't
makin'
excuses,
Look,
we
need
to
tell
people.
No
need
to
say
how
it
went
down
but,
uh,
we're
in
the
deep
shit
here.
People
need
to
know.
MYRON:
We
got
plenty
of
them
in
the
store.
-
OLLIE:
Brent
Norton?
He's
an
important
attorney
That
fellow
could
be
Counts
a
lot
with
people
of
this
town,
-
MYRON:
Yeah,
that's
right.
We've
got
to
discuss
how
we're
gonna
W-wait.
What
do
you
mean
You
shut
the
loading
door.
Yeah,
but
the
entire
front
of
the
store
Jesus
Christ.
NORTON:
I
was
wondering
DAVID:
Um,

guy
that
came
in
here,

they're--
Ain't

very
well,

It's
true.
Tentacles.
Yeah.
Um,
gentlemen,
um...
I'm
sorry,
I--
I
mean,
what
do
you
take
me
for?
I'm
shocked.
I'm
shocked.
I'm
shocked.
It's
pretty
tasteless
using
what's
happening
here
No,

that's
not
Look,
come
back
I'll
show
you.
Blood.
A
chunk
of
tentacle
No.
No?
What
do
you
mean
no?
No.
We've
got
real
problems
and
this
pathetic
attempt
at
a
joke
has
gone
far
enough.
Mr.
Norton,
what
reason
Oh,
please!
Please!
This
is
payback
for
the
lawsuit
and
you
guys
are
backing
him
up.
So
winning
wasn't
enough,
huh?
You
wanted
to
humiliate
me
show
me
a
rubber
snake
stand
around
laughing
their
asses
off.
-
Watch
who
you
callin'
a
hick!
-
Hey,
hey,
fuck--!
...
I
swear,
you
have
You're
not
too
crazy
about,
I
only
spend
my
money,
and
I
have
seen
you
Y'all
stick
together.
Well,
don't
I
feel
foolish?
I
actually
thought
you
were
and,
well,
thanks
And
I'm
glad
that
tree
fell
Glad.
Smashed
it
in
Now,
all
of
y'all,
I
know
you're
scared,
man.
-
Lives
are
at
stake
around
here.
Okay,
my
son's
life.
Brent,
please,
All
right,
I'll
drag
you
Come
here.
David,
get
your
goddamn
hands
I'll
sue
your
ass
again!
Sue
your
ass,
and
this
time
This
man
assaulted
me.
He
assaulted
me.
This
man's
crazy.
No.
He
isn't.
I
wish
he
was,
but
he
isn't.

E-everyone
in
the
store,
There's
something
you
need
to
hear.
Okay.
BUD:
W-w-wait.
I
don't
know
You're
drinking?
For
Christ's
sake,
Ollie.
Do
you
want
me
to
report
you?
Look,
I'm
gonna
be
taking
down
And
I
am
prepared
to
file
-
Fine,
Bud,
write
down
your
names.
But
in
the
meantime,
This
is
Mr.
David
Drayton.
You
need
to
hear
what
he's
got
to
say
DAVID:...go
hang
out
Listen,
don't
be
scared.
It's
okay.
Okay.
This
is
how
it
is.
Now,
I
don't
know
but
there
are
things
in
it,
and
they're
That's
right.
That's
exactly
right.
MAN:
What
kind
of
things?
I
never
saw
it.
I
got
knocked
down.
Five
of
us
went
back
It
was
Jim,
Myron,
Ollie...
me...
Norm,
the
bag
boy.
-
We
opened
the
door...
...so
Norm
could
go
out
Something
come
out
of
the
mist
Took
him?
What
do
you
mean?
Just...
killed
him.
I
mean
dragged
him
off.
Now,
guys,
I
don't
know
All
we
saw
were
tentacles.

WOMAN:
Tentacles?
NORTON:
Tentacles,
he
says.
Tentacles
from
Planet
X.
It's
a
lie,
you
know.
I
mean,
all
these
people
do
It's
a
pile
of
shit.
Of
course
it's
a
lie.
It's
lunacy.
From
the
look
of
it,
the
tentacles
All
right,
uh,
Bud,
Go
look.
DAVID:

What
the
hell
is
that?

It
appears
we
may
have
a
problem
Yeah,
just
keep
'em
in
line.
Let
me...
help
these
people.
Let
me--
let
me
preach
your
word.
Let
me
shine
your
light,
'cause
they're
not
all
bad.
They
can't
all
be
bad.
Some
can
be
saved,
can't
they?
Yes.
Some
can
be
brought...
to
heaven's
holy
gates
I
have
to
believe
that,
though
I
know
most
will
swim
If
I
can
save
a
few...
even
one...
then
my
life
will
have
counted
I
will
have
pulled
my
weight.
I
will
have
earned
my
place
I
will
have
served
a
purpose
Hello?

What?
I
just
need
to
use
the
bathroom.
Oh.
Okay.
Well,
then,
have
at
it.
Ma'am...
I--
I
just
want
you
to
know
being
scared,
I
mean--
and,
well,
if
you
need
a
friend--
you
know,
someone
to
talk
to.
I
have
a
friend--
God
up
above.
Don't
you
condescend
to
me.
I'm
sorry?
Not
ever.
That's
not
what
I
was
doing.
Well,
I'll
tell
you
what--
the
day
I
need
a
friend
like
you,
I'll
just
have
myself
a
little
squat
Maybe
you
do
believe
this.
Maybe
they're
not
lies,
Uh,
the
fact
remains,
-
It's
bordering
on
ludicrous.
You're
not
arguing
a
case,
and
you're
doing
nothing
but
damage,
And
you
can
throw
as
much
cow's
blood
You
still
haven't
fooled
anyone.
OLLIE:
Leave
it
alone,
David.
You
can't
convince
even
when
their
hair
is
burning.
Denial
is
a
powerful
thing.
Well,
keep
talking.
I'll
have
no
part
of
it,
Keep
thinking,
Mr.
Lawyer.
There's
no
defense
There's
no
court
of
appeals
in
hell.
There's
no
defense
here,
either.
Not
even
with
all
the
fertilizer
not
even
if
you
stack
it
It's
still
just
bags
of
shit,
isn't
it?
Those
of
you
who
want
to
discuss
to
find
a
means
of
rescue
Those
who
want
to
stack
dog
food,
knock
yourselves
out.
We
got
those
windows
taped
up
It
should
help.
Yeah,
think
so?
Duct
tape
and
dog
food
bags.
That
bad?
It's
not
good.
There's
none
so
blind
Open
your
eyes.
Let
the
scales
fall
away.
This
has
all
been
written.
Revelations,
chapter
15:
"And
the
temple
was
filled
with
smoke
"from
the
glory
of
God
"and
from
his
power,
"and
no
one
could
enter
the
temple
until
the
seven
plagues
Well,
what
are
you
saying?
What
are
you
proposing?
That
we
all
prepare...
to
meet
our
Maker.
JIM:
Oh,
prepare
to
meet
shit!
Lady,
your
tongue
so
that
it
can
waggle
at
both
ends.
MRS.
CARMODY:
not
in
flames,
but
in
mist.
JIM:
Come
here!
MYRON:
Easy!
Back
off!
How
about
if
your
ass
prepares
How
about
that?
Hey,
there's
no
call
for
that.
Myron,
please,
MRS.
CARMODY:
I'm
trying
-
Doubters
will
doubt
till
the
end.
No,
I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry.
A
monstrosity
did
pull
Things
in
the
mist--
Do
you?
Then
go
out.
Go
out
and
say,
Shut
up,
lady.
For
God's
sakes.
Look,
you'll
have
to
stop
now.
They
should
be
scared.
Oh,
yes,
they
should.
Their
beautiful,
pure
little
minds
have
been
corrupted
with
lies.
Lies.
All
this
talk
of
a
modern
God,
or
no
God.
There
is
one
God.
The
God
of
the
Israelites.
And
he
is
a
stern
and
vengeful
God,
and
we
have
been
mocking
him
and
now
he
demands
It
is
time
to
declare
yourselves.
Take
sides--
the
saved
and
the
damned.
Read
the
Good
Book.
-
Blood!
Blood.
Little
Normie
was
first,
and
now
God
calls
the
rest
of
us.
The
bill
is
due.
It
must
be
paid.
As
Abraham
prepared
to
prove
his
love
for
God,
so--
-
Enough.
-
Ohh.
A
few
more
pennies
in
the
jar.
Now,
that's
nice,
see.
I-I'm
sorry
everybody,
but
this
lady's
perspective
is
MRS.
CARMODY:
Maybe
tonight,
They'll
come
tonight,
See
if
they
don't.
And
when
they
do,
you
will
cry
to
God,
and
you
will
beg
Mother
Carmody
OLLIE:
That's
fine.
But
until
then,
I'll
wrap
this
tape
around
your
mouth.
You
just
try
it,
Ollie
Weeks.
And
you,
bitch...
you
hit
me
again...
if
you
dare.
You'll
be
on
your
knees
to
me
Those
of
you
who
aren't
local
that
Mrs.
Carmody
unstable.
No
shit.
SOLDIER:
Shh.
Hi.
What's
up,
little
dude?
How
come
your
friends
They
got
tanks
and
stuff,
right?
Why
can't
you
just
call
'em?
Phones
don't
work.
But
don't
you
got,
like,
a
radio?
Hey,
champ,
what's
going
on?
I
want
their
friends
They
would
if
they
could,
pal.
But--
Shh.
Now,
guys,
we
could
use
SOLDIER:
Yeah,
sure
thing.
SOLDIER
#2:
-
DAVID:
You
all
right?
Oh,
man,
I
don't
either.
But
you
know
what?
Maybe
she's
scared
too.
You
think?
You
think
Mommy's
okay?

I'm
sorry
about
the
times
Aw,
hey.
Mommy
loves
you
very
much.
And
I'll
bet
she's
fine.
And
I
promise
you,
I'm
gonna
do
everything
I
can
-
Okay?
-
Yeah?
So,
we
can
use
the
charcoal
fluid
to
make
torches.
And
we've
got
knives
and
stuff,
This
may
be
do
you
happen
to
have
Here?
No.
Please.
This--
this
isn't
Los
Angeles.
I've
got
a
shotgun
in
my
truck.
I
could
try
for
it
if
you
want.
Oh,
God,
I
don't
think
that'd
be
Hold
on.
This
gun,
um...
my
husband's
idea.
He's
away
on
business
a
lot.
It's
not
even
loaded.
Ain't
much
use
unloaded,
ma'am.
AMANDA:
Um...
DAVID:
Well,
I
shot
it
once
on
a
pistol
range.
Hit
the
target
a
few
times.
So,
we
got
a
gun.
Anybody
know
how
to
shoot
it?
Well,
I
mean?
I
do.
You?

Some
target
shooting.
State
champion
in
'94.

MAN:
You're
crazy
if
you
go
out
there!
Let
us
pass,
please!
Let's
just
talk
this
thing
through.
NORTON:
We
have,
and
we've
Hey,
Mr.
Mackey's
gonna
barbecue
-
Why
don't
we
just
sit
down
and
just--
No,
I've
been
in
far
too
many
You've
already
psyched
out
AMANDA:
Your
people?
What
kind
of
talk
is
that?
Now--
now
listen,
everyone.
We
are
experiencing
I
don't
know
whether
but
I
do
know
that
or
biblical,
but
the
only
way
is
to
seek
rescue.
We're
going
out.
-
Brent,
look.
I
know.
I
just
want
to
ask
a
favor.
Tie
this
around
your
waist.
What
for?
It'll
let
us
know
you
got
I'll
do
it.
Are
you
throwing
in
with
them?
Me?
No
thanks.
I
think
your
man
there
Gonna
get
somebody
killed.
But
I'm
thinkin'
we
could
use
I
saw
where
you
parked
Red
pickup,
right?
Son,
you
got
brass
balls.
The
shells
are
Drive
it
back.
All
right.
Just
see
they're
paying
out
this
line.
Line's
up,
I'll
cut
her
loose,
just
so
you
understand.
DAVID:
Yeah.
You
sure
there's
no
way
David...
there's
nothing
out
there.
What
if
you're
wrong?
Then,
I
guess...
the
joke
would
be
on
me
after
all.
We're
gonna
send
back
help.
You'll
die
out
there.
Hey,
crazy
lady,
I
just
don't
think
you
make
him
out
to
be.
Well,
you
take
that
up
with
the
devil
You
just
chat
it
over
at
your
leisure.
Well,
let's
strike
out
Keep
it
loose.
DAVID:
Nice
and
easy.
OLLIE:


JIM:
Look.
It's
going.
They're
doing
good.
Aah!
Aaahhhh!


MAN:
Put
it
down!
Ohh!
Pull!
MAN:
Oh,
my
God!
Pull!
Back
up!
Back
up!

Get
it
off!
Oh,
my
God.

-
JIM:
Aw,
sh--
Awww,
sh--!
MRS.
CARMODY'
-


Cut
the
rope!
Shut
the
door!
Now
do
you
see?
Now
do
you
believe?
