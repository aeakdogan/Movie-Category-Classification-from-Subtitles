I
have
sailed
the
world
Beheld
its
wonders
From
the
Dardanelles
To
the
mountains
of
Peru
But
there's
no
place
like
London
No,
there's
no
place
like
London
Mr.
Todd?
You
are
young
Life
has
been
kind
to
you
You
will
learn
There's
a
hole
in
the
world
And
the
vermin
of
And
its
morals
aren't
And
it
goes
by
At
the
top
of
the
hole
Making
mock
of
the
Turning
beauty
I
too
have
sailed
the
world
For
the
cruelty
of
men
But
there's
no
place
like
London


Is
everything
all
right,
Mr.
Todd?
I
beg
your
indulgence,
Anthony.
My
mind
is
far
from
easy.
In
these
once
familiar
streets
Shadows?
Ghosts.
There
was
a
barber
and
his
wife
And
she
was
beautiful
A
foolish
barber
and
his
wife
She
was
his
reason
and
his
life
And
she
was
beautiful
And
she
was
virtuous
And
he
was
Naive
There
was
another
man
who
A
pious
vulture
of
the
law
Who,
with
a
gesture
of
his
claw
Removed
the
barber
from
his
plate
Then
there
was
nothing
but
to
wait
And
she
would
fall
So
soft,
so
young
so
And
the
lady,
sir,
did
she
succumb?
Oh,
that
was
many
years
ago
I
doubt
if
anyone
would
know
I'd
like
to
thank
you,
Anthony.
If
you
hadn't
spotted
me,
I'd
be
lost
on
the
ocean
still.
Will
I
see
you
again?
You
might
find
me
if
you
like.
Around
Fleet
Street,
Until
then,
my
friend.
There's
a
hole
in
the
world
And
it's
filled
with
people
And
the
vermin
of



A
customer!
Wait!
What's
your
rush?
You
gave
me
such
a
fright
Half
a
minute,
can't
you
sit?
All
I
meant
is
that
I
haven't
Did
you
come
here
for
a
pie,
sir?
Do
forgive
me
if
me
What
was
that?
But
you'd
think
From
the
way
that
No,
you
don't.
Heaven
knows
I
try,
sir!
But
there's
no
one
Right
you
are,
sir
would
Mind
you,
I
can
hardly
blame
them
These
are
probably
the
I
know
why
nobody
I
should
know,
I
make
them
But
good?
No!
The
worst
pies
in
London
Even
that's
polite
The
worst
pies
in
London
If
you
doubt
it,
take
a
bite
Is
that
just
disgusting?
It's
nothing
but
crusting
Here,
drink
this,
you'll
need
it
The
worst

in
London
And
no
wonder
with

What,
up
there?
People
think
it's

Haunted?
And
who's
to
say
they're
wrong?
You
see,
years
ago,
something
Something
not
very
nice.
There
was
a
barber
and
his
wife
And
he
was
beautiful
A
proper
artist
with
a
knife
But
they
transported
And
he
was
beautiful
Barker,
his
name
was.
What
was
his
crime?
Foolishness.
He
had
this
wife,
you
see
Pretty
little
thing,
Had
her
chance
for
Poor
thing
Poor
thing
There
was
this
judge,
you
see
Wanted
her
like
mad
Every
day
he
sent
her
a
flower
But
did
she
come
Sat
up
there
and
Poor
fool
But
there
was
worse
Well,
Beadle
calls
Poor
thing
Poor
thing
The
Judge,
he
tells
He
blames
himself
for
She
must
come
straight
Poor
thing,
poor
thing
Of
course,
when
she
goes
there
Poor
thing,
poor
thing
They're
having
this
There's
no
one
she
knows
there
Poor
dear,
poor
thing
She
wanders
tormented
and
drinks
Poor
thing
The
Judge
has
repented,
Poor
thing
"Oh,
where
is
Judge
Turpin?"
He
was
there
all
right
Only
not
so
contrite
She
wasn't
no
match
And
everyone
thought
it
so
droll
They
figured
she
had
So
all
of
them
stood


Poor
thing...


No!
Would
no
one
have
mercy
on
her?
So,
it
is
you,
Benjamin
Barker?
Where
is
Lucy?
Where
is
my
wife?
She
poisoned
herself.
Arsenic,
from
the
apothecary
Tried
to

her,
but

And

He?

I
could

her
here
I'd

Bring
her

She
had
yellow
hair.
You

She's
gone.
Life

my
dear.
We
could
have
a

Maybe
not
like
I
dreamed.
Maybe
not
like
you
remember.
But
we
could
get

care
of
it.
Open
the
door,
I
said.
"Don't

should
think
she
was
dead
Yes,
I
lied
