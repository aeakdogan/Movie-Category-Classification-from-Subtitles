What
am
I
working
on?
I'm
working
on
something
...and
human
life
as
we
know
it.
Change
it
a
lot
or
just
a
bit?
You
want
me
to
be
specific
...with
half
the
scientific
community
Is
there
another
way?
You
could
come
back
to
my
lab.
Listen,
l'll
make
cappuccino.
I
have
a
Faema
of
my
own.
It's
not
the
dilettante's
It's
a
real
restaurant
espresso
machine
Somehow
l
get
the
feeling
-You
can
tell
that?
You're
making
a
mistake.
Sorry.
l
have
three
other
interviews
But
they're
not
working
on
something
They
say
they
are.
Yeah,
but
they're
lying.
I'm
not.
Are
you
sick?
No--
Sure.
You're
not
a
very
accomplished
drunk.
No,
I'm
always
like
this.
lt's
the...
...motion
sickness.
When
I
was
a
kid,
I
hate
vehicles.
Should
I
drive
more
slowly?
No,
no,
no.
Just
turn
left.
This
is
it?
It's
cleaner
on
the
inside.
Please.
Listen.
Maybe
this
is
a
bad
idea.
It's
too
late.
You've
already
seen
them.
I
haven't
seen
anything.
Those.
Designer
phone
booths.
Very
cute.
Hey,
I
bet
you
have
a
really
neat
Over
there
maybe?
No.
No.
This
is
the...
...prototype
of
those.
It
works,
but
it's
clunky.
I
call
them
telepods.
They're
controlled
by
this.
Thank
God
for
that.
So,
what
do
they
do,
Telepods.
Okay,
l
need
an
object.
Say,
do
you
have
something
on
you
...personal
that
l
could
use?
An
item
of
clothing
or
jewelry?
What,
are
you
kidding?
No,
I'm
serious.
Okay.
Here
it
goes.
Mm-hm.
-l
don't
wear
jewelry.
It's
nice.
Brundle,
Seth.
BRUNDLE'S
VOICE
:
Brundle,
Seth.

Keep
your
eye
on
the
stocking.
Well?
Great.
The
world's
largest
microwave
oven.
If
l
had
a
Rolex.
No,
you're
missing
the
point.
Look.
Teleportation?
Please.
Oh....
Wait
a
minute.
Is
that
a
hologram?
-Where's
my
stocking?
Go
ahead,
pick
it
up.
I
don't
think
l
get
it.
What
happened?
You
get
it
all
right,
Your
stocking
has
just
...from
one
pod
to
another.
Disintegrated
there
Sort
of.
It'll
change
the
world
Oh.
Oh.
This
is--
This
is
incredible.
I
mean,
it's
not
possible,
is
it?
How
have
you
managed
Please
sit
down.
How
could
you
do
this
alone?
Well,
l
don't
work
alone.
There's
stuff
in
there
I
don't
...a

But
none
of
them

Wow.
And
the
money?
Mm-hm.
But
they
leave
me
alone
And
they
know
they'll
end
up
-You
haven't
told
them?

Wait
a
second.
What's
that?
-You
want
me
to
get
the
quotes
right.
I
thought
this
was
personal.
What
are
you
talking
about?
-Oh,
no,
no,
no.
I'm
sorry,
I
made
a
mistake.
I
shouldn't
Listen.
Particle
Magazine
sent
me
And
this
is
the
most
exciting
thing
No.
Absolutely
not.
-Please.
Don't
you
dare
write
a
story.
I'd
never
have
told
-But
you
did
tell
it
to
a
journalist.
-Sure
did.
Wait.
Come
here.
Keep
it
for
good
luck.
BRUNDLE
:
...who
are
more
brilliant
than
I.
I
say:

VERONlCA:
Wow.
And

BRUNDLE:
But
they

alone
And
they
know
they'll
end
up
Well,
that's
it.
What
do
you
think?
It's
a
joke.
-What?
It's
an
old
nightclub
routine.

-And
you
fell
for
it.
-That
was
no
night--
Listen.
That
was
no
nightclub
routine.
Yup?
Sure.
Send
him
in.
You
must
have
made
an
impression.
What
do
you
mean?
Your
magician
has
followed
you
here.

I'm
Stathis
Borans.
-Seth
Brundle.
Listen,
why
don't
you
two
use
If
you
plan
to
make
anything
I've
got
an
assistant
editor
You
didn't
waste
any
time.
I'm
not
getting
any
younger.
He
wasn't
impressed
by
your
tape?
He
thinks
you're
a
con
man.
-Excellent.
Well,
let's
see
what
the
people
No,
no.
Listen,
Veronica....
I've
come
here
Yeah?
Cheeseburger.
I've
been
working
alone
too
long.
I
have
a
strong
urge
But
if
this
gets
out
now...
...Veronica,
it'll
kill
me.
The
Bartok
people
It's
not
ready
yet.
It
seems
to
work
okay.
No,
something
important's
missing.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Which
is?
I
can
only
teleport
inanimate
objects.
What
happens
when
you
Not
while
we're
eating.
Can't
be
worse
than
this.
Listen,
you're
not
doing
a
very
good
job
I
think
the
world
should
know
about
it
now.
You
should
tell
it...
...but
not
yet.
Enough
to
make
you
nervous.
Why
not
get
more?
I'm
talking
about
a
book,
Follow
me
and
my
work
day
by

I
don't
have
a

so
there's

...transporting
myself

That's
what's
really
missing.
Wait
for
me
that
long?

What
are
you
doing
in
my
apartment?
Just
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood.
Rough
day.


How
did
you
get
in?
I
have
a
key,
remember?
You
gave
it
to
me.
I
knew
l
should've
changed
the
lock.
I
knew
you
wouldn't.
-Yeah?
That's
because
unconsciously...
...you
still
want
me
to
come
back,
No.
That's
because,
very
consciously,
Your
new
playmate's
an
interesting
guy.
What
playmate?
The
nightclub
act.
Brundle.
-Yeah?
Yeah,
l
was
wrong.
He
was
the
leader
of
the
F32
team.
An
inch
away
from

the

That's
not
like
you.
Are
you
getting
out
or
am
l?
I'll
go.
I
have
to
put
this
issue
to
bed.
No.
Key.
I'll
keep
it...
...for
old
time's
sake.
You're
a
petty
schmuck.
Initiate
in
five
seconds.

I've
gotta
do
this,
Seth.
Talk
to
the
tape.
Get
in
the
habit.
The
world
will
wanna
know
"Fuck"
is
what
I'm
thinking!
Good.
The
world
will
wanna
know
that.
What
else?
Why
didn't
it
work?
I
think
it
turned
the
baboon
Why?
Can't
deal
with
the
flesh.
...nothing
that's
living.
It
must
be
my
fault.
Why?
Computers
are
dumb.
I
must
not
know
enough
about
I
don't
wanna
talk
now.
Do
you
ever
change
your
clothes?
What?
The
clothes.
You're
always
No,
these
are
clean.
Five
sets
of
exactly
the
same
clothes?
Learned
it
from
Einstein.
This
way
l
don't
have
to...
...expend
any
thought
on
what
l'll
wear.
I
bought
some
steaks.
We
could
go
out.
Cheeseburger?
No,
we
don't
have
to
go
there.
You're
very
cute.
You
know
that?
Am
l?

Oh,
ow!
-What
happened?
Oh.
Oh,
God.
Well,
pull
it
off.
VERONlCA:
Oh,
ew.
Ow.
Sorry.
Oh,
huh.
I
wondered
what
happened
to
this.
-Do
you
have
any
disinfectant?
I'm
gonna
kiss
it
for
you.
Thank
you.
Ow,
ow,
ow.
Sorry.
l
just
wanna
eat
you
up.
You
know,
that's
why
old
ladies
It's
the
flesh.
lt
just
makes
you
crazy.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
You
wanna
try
an
experiment?
Sure.
BRUNDLE:
Eat
this.
-Yes?
It
could
use
some
finesse,
BRUNDLE:
Now
try
this
teleported
half.
-A
monkey
just
came
apart
in
there.
-Oh--
That
tastes
funny.
-Funny
how?
...synthetic.
Mm-hm.
So,
what
have
we
proved?
The
computer
is
giving
us
...of
a
steak.
It's
translating
it
for
us,
...rather
than
reproducing
it.
And
something's
getting
lost
Me.
l'm
lost.
The
flesh.
It
should
make
the
computer
crazy.
But
it
doesn't,
not
yet.
I
haven't
taught
the
computer
The
poetry
of
the
steak.
So
l'm
gonna
start
teaching
it
now.
I
should've
known
it.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
followed
you.
Psychology
Today,
my
ass.
Why
didn't

l

Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,

great
in
this.
For
your
TIME

cover,
Don't
you
get
it?
l
am
finally
-Huge.
Crude,
Stathis.
Very
crude.
You're
too
perfect
to
believe.
You're
a
goddess.
Thank
you
for
making
my
I
don't
have
to
report
to
you,
Ronnie?
You've
got
to
talk
to
me.
I
don't
have
to.
I'll
spend
the
night
Sorry.
l'll
take
this
too.

I
think
it's
time
for
champagne.
VERONlCA:
It's
really
happened.
You
did
it.
-You'll
never
have
to
get
carsick
again.
I
know.
Or
tricycle-sick.
What's
next?
We'll
send
the
baboon
out
for
tests,
How
long
will
that
take?
Could
be
weeks.
Really?
Yeah,
why?
Well,
l
was
thinking
that
We
could?
Yeah.
You
know,
The
old
man's
got
...they
go
to
Florida,
someplace
warm.
Just
you
and
me?
Yeah.
ls
there
someone
else
No,
no,
I
just....
Is
this
a
romance
we're
having?
Yeah.
Could
be
a
romance.
Come
here.
I
have
a
great
idea.
You
like
Chinese
food?
Yes.
We're
gonna
have
Hey,
what's
this?
From
your
editor.
Hello,
Victor?
-Yeah,
I'll
wait.
BRUNDLE:

Nothing.
It's
just
personal
bullshit.
Old
married
couples
That's
how
they
-Listen,
Seth,
don't
rush
it.
-Look,
I
have
to
go
out
for
a
few
hours.
No,
Ronnie,
spicy
eggplant,
champagne.
Just
for
a
few
hours.
I
have
to
scrape
it
off
my
shoe
Hi.

VERONlCA:
It
means
that
l'm
your
editor
and
You
told
me
there
was
no
story.
I've
decided
to
trust
Thanks
very
much.
It's
mine.
Says
who?
I
sent
you
to
the
Bartok
party
Your
discovery
is
my
discovery.
I
have
a
lot
of
background
on
Brundle.
He's
been
working
on
this
for
six
years.
There's
material
to
find

Everything
that

to
do
with
And
l
am
right
there
in
the
middle
of
it.
-The
only
inside
recorder
of
the
event.
Okay.
Look,
just
keep
me
informed.
As
a
friend?
As
a
professional
confidante?
That's
all?
I
don't
want
you
Okay.
What
about
sex?
I'm
not
saying
love
or
affection.
You
and
me.
You're
disgusting.
As
always.

Wouldn't
wanna
disappoint
you.

How
about,

What
is
this,
the
Ronnie
game?
I'm
catching
on.
l'm
catching
on.
I
didn't
mean
to
kill
your
brother,
...if
that's
of
any
comfort.
As
the
general
said,
l
wouldn't
ask
you

Hey,
you're
all
right.
I'm
looking
at
you.
What
are
we
waiting
for?
Let's
do
it.


How
you
doing?
Now,
you
tell
me.
Am
l
different
somehow?
"Is
it
live
or
is
it
Memorex?"
It's
too
bad
Ronnie
missed
it.
I
missed
you
last
night.
It's
still
night.
I
came
back.
You
had
to
celebrate
without
me.
I
went
through
last
night.
You
went
through?
Without
testing
the
baboon?
I
was
drunk.
I
was
a
bit
upset.
You
could've
killed
yourself.
Are
you
sleeping
with
Stathis
Borans?
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
don't
know.
That's
why
you
were
upset?
I
got
jealous.
Oh,
God.
Seth,
you
don't
He's
an
old
boyfriend.
He
was
teaching
at
college.
He
got
me
started
in
journalism.
Is
he
still
in
love
with
you?
How
could
he
not
be?
Hey.
Oh,
what
about
our
deal?
Don't
worry,
l
taped
it
for
you.
You
did?




BRUNDLE:
So
I
asked
the
computer
if
it
had
That's
made
me
think
about
what
...that
the
sheer
process
of
being
taken
It's
like
filtering
coffee.
It's
a
purifying
I'll
tell
you,
I
think
...the
personal
potential
l've
been
...that
l've
been
obsessively
pursuing
-Do
you
take
coffee
with
your
sugar?
You
know,
I
just
don't
think
But,
of
course
interestingly,
...what
will
probably
prove
...that's
when
l
started
So,
listen...
...not
to
wax
Messianic...
...but
the
synchronicity
of
those
two
But
it
is,
nevertheless,
also
certainly
true.
I
will
say
now,
however
subjectively,
...molecular
breakdown
and
reformation
It
makes
a
man
a
king.
Since
l
walked
out
I
think
I
am
gonna
have
a
cannoli
I
mean,
what
an
accomplishment.
All
I've
done
is
say
to
the
world:
"Let's
go.
Move.
Jesus
Christ!

VERONlCA:
Oh,
God.
BRUNDLE:
VERONlCA:
You
can't
have
any
fluid
left
We've
been
doing
this
for
hours.
I'm
not
ready
to
quit
yet.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Hey.
What's
this?
BRUNDLE:
No,
really,
what
is
it?
lt's
like...
-...hairs
or
something.
It
happens
when
you
get
older,
They're
really
coarse.
I've
never
really
been
hairy
enough.
I'm
looking
forward
to
a
hairy
body.
It's
one
of
the
compensations
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Relax,
Brundle.
I
don't
really
think
you
want
God!
They're
really
tough!
Listen.
I
want
you
to
go
through.
You'll
feel
incredible.
l
hardly
It's
like
a
drug
The
power
l
feel
surging
inside
me--!
We'll
be
the
perfect
couple.
-Right
now.
Don't
give
me
that
born-again
What
do
I
have
to
say?
You're
a
fucking
drag,
you
know?
Something
went
wrong.
When
you
No?
Not
you?
If
you're
too
chickenshit
to
be
...l'll
find
somebody
else
Seth,
listen
to
me--
You're
afraid
to
dive
You're
afraid
to
be
destroyed
Think
you
woke
me
up
about
the
flesh?
You
only
know
society's
You
can't
penetrate
society's
Drink
deep,
or
taste
not
the
plasma
This
is
not
just
sex
and
penetration,
...beyond
the
veil
of
the
flesh.
A
deep,
penetrating
dive
I'll
have
a
Scotch.
Who's
winning?
I
don't
know.
I
hope
it's
Marky.
-How
come?
I
like
Marky
tonight.
Well,
l
like
you
tonight.
Maybe
I'd
better
get
involved.
Hey,
pal,
you're
disturbing
us.
$1
00

l
can
beat
either
of
you.
-Take
a
hike,
asshole.
Here's
my
hundred.
I
get
to
take
the
lady
home
Says
who?
Do
I
look
like
a
hooker?
Tawny,
it's
an
easy

-Watch
out.

TAWNY:

TAWNY:
-Let's
go
back
to
my
place.
Yeah,
well,
okay.
But
could
we
go
to

a
little
too
early
to
quit.
Great
place.
Hey!
There's
no
elevator.
-l
can't
make
it.
There,
don't
you
feel
elevated?
TAWNY:
Wow.
Are
you
some
sort
of
magician?
Yes.
So
are
we
going
to
breakfast
or
not?
It's
your
turn.
-To
do
what?
No.
I
don't
wanna
try
that.
Why
not?
It'll
make
you
feel
sexy.
But
l
already
feel
sexy.
How
about...
...a
nice...
-...alcohol
rub?
Sorry,
hon.
I
didn't
know
you
had
-You're
real
sensitive,
huh?
That's
it.
You're
going
to
like
it.
-l
don't
want
to.
I'm
afraid.
VERONlCA:
Be
afraid.
Be
very
afraid.
Who's
this?
I
forgot
to
tell
you.
Mom,
meet
Tawny.
I
gotta
go.
Thanks
for
a
wonderful
time.
Why'd
you
scare
her
off?
Jealous?
You're
changing,
Seth.
Everything
about
you
is
changing.
You
look
bad.
You
smell
bad.
I've
never
been
much
of
a
bather.
Those
weird
hairs
that
grew
out
I
had
them
analyzed.
The
hairs?
Oh,
yeah.
Not
as
strange
as
the
results.
The
guy
at
the
lab
He
finally
concluded
that
they
Oh.
-Very
good.
In
fact,
very
likely
insect
hairs.
That's
silly.
That's
ridiculous.
Look.
Now
there's
more.
Look
at
your
face.
Something
happened
You've
got
to
get
some
help.
You're
jealous!
I've
become
free.
I've
been
released,
You'll
do
anything
to
bring
me
down.
Does
this
look
like
a
sick
man
to
you?
No,
stop
it!
Know
any
sick
men
who
do
that?
The
deal
is
off.
No,
wait.
Seth,
please,
wait.
Seth!
Don't
come
back.
Oh,
God.

Oh,
no.
What's
happening
to
me?
Am
I
dying?
Is
this
how
it
starts?
Am
l
dying?
Brundle,
Seth.
Give
me
a
disc.
I
need
the
first
Run
sequence.

Hello.

Seth.
Seth,
I've
been
trying
to
reach
you.
BRUNDLE:
For
the
last
four
weeks,
Now
I'm
afraid
not
to.
Where
are
you?
You
don't
know
how
right
you
were.
l've
gotten...
...much,
much
worse.
Please
come
see
me.
Please
come
now.
Seth?
I'm
here.
BRUNDLE:
Seth.
You
were
right.
I'm
diseased...
...and
it
might
be
contagious
somehow.
I
wouldn't
want
to
infect
you.
And
it's
been
accelerating.
It's
unrelenting.
Every
time
l
look
in
the
mirror,
What
happened?

Seth,
please.
I
was
not
pure.
The
teleporter
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
A
fly...
...got
into
the
transmitter
pod
with
me
The
computer
got
confused.
There
weren't
supposed
And
it
decided
to
splice
us
together.
It
mated
us,
me
and
the
fly.
My
teleporter
turned
A
very
good
one.
I'm
the
offspring
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God,
Seth!
You
look
so
pretty.
What
will
happen?
I
think
it's
showing
itself
General
cellular
chaos
and
revolution.
In
a
novel
way,
no
doubt.
Then
l'll
die.
-And
then
it
will
be
over.
There
must
be
something
we
can
do,
No!
I
won't
be
...talking
endlessly
about
his
hair
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
Oh....
That's
disgusting.
My...
...ear.
No!
I'm
scared.
Help
me.
Please.
Please,
help
me.
-Don't
go
back
to
him.
That's
your
advice?
He's
right.
It
could
be
contagious.
I
have
to
go
back
to
him.
-l
don't
believe
this.
If
you
saw
how
scared
and
angry
I'm
sure
Typhoid
Mary
was
nice
too
-l
do
not
want--
All
right,
fine,
okay.
Do
I
have
permission
to
claim
Oh,
God.
Look,
how
about
this?
You
say,
if
only
l
saw
him.
Show
me.
Tape
him.
Show
me.
Let
me
think
about
it.
I'll
come
up
with
something.
Seth?
-Seth?
Oh!
I've
gotten
pretty
good
at
it,
haven't
l?
Yeah,
it's
almost
second
nature.
I
stopped
biting
my
nails.
Look
at
this.
What's
this?
I
don't
know.
I
seem
to
be
stricken
by
a
disease
Maybe
not
such
a
bad
disease
I
can't
stay.
No,
no,
no.
Why
not?
Why
can't
you?
I
can't
take
it.
It's
too
much.
What's
there
to
take?
We
don't
have
to
worry
about
contagion.
What
does
the
disease
want?
It
wants
to
turn
me
into
something
else.
That's
not
terrible.
Most
people
would
Turned
into
what?
What
do
you
think,
a
fly?
No,
I'm
becoming
something
I'm
becoming
"Brundlefly."
Don't
you
think
Here.
I
want
to
give
a
demonstration...
...that
l
think
you'll
want
I
think
you
must
chronicle...
...the
life
and
times
of
Brundlefly,
At
the
very
least,
it
should
make
You
seem
tired.
You
got
me
there?
How
does
Brundlefly
eat?
He
found
out
the
hard
way
that
His
teeth
are
now
useless.
Because
although
he
can
chew
up
Solid
food
hurts.
So,
like
a
fly...
...Brundlefly
breaks
down
solids
...playfully
called
"vomit
drop."
He
regurgitates
on
his
food.
And
then
he
sucks
it
back
up.
Ready
for
a
demonstration,
kids?
Here
it
goes.

Oh,
my
God.
My
God!

Hey,
Ronnie.
Ronnie!
What
is
it?
I'm
pregnant.
Oh,
no.
I'm
pregnant
with
Seth's
baby.
What
do
you
wanna
do?
I
don't
know.
I
just....
I
don't
know.
-Stathis,
I'm
scared.
It's
going
to
be
fine.
I
don't
think
l
want
to
lose
it.
Is
there
something
wrong?
It's
better
this
way,
Ronnie.
It's
the
best
thing
that
could
happen.
GYNECOLOGlST:
It's
coming
out.
NURSE:
lt's
gonna
be
easy.
No.
Please,
no.
GYNECOLOGlST:
A
little
suction

Suction.
Hold
it.
Hold
on
a
minute.
VERONlCA:
GYNECOLOGlST:
You're
gonna
have
to
help
us.
Push
it
out.
Come
on,
push.
-That's
it.
Come
on,
push.
GYNECOLOGlST:
Give
us
a
push.
-No,
wait,
wait.
No.
Wait.
No!

I
want
a
disc.
BRUNDLE'S
VOICE
:
I
want
You're
relics.
Yes,
you
are.
Vestigial,
archaeological,
redundant.
Artifacts
of
a
bygone
era.
Of
historical
interest
only.
You've
missed
some
good
moments.
Is
that
why
you're
here?
To
catch
up?
I
wanted....
My
teeth
have
begun
to
fall
out.
The
medicine
cabinet's

it?
Then...

you...
...before....
You

to
leave
now...
...and
never

back
here.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
insect
politics?
Neither
have
l.
Insects
don't
have
politics.
They're
very
brutal.
No
compassion.
No
compromise.
We
can't
trust
the
insect.
I'd
like
to
become...
...the
first
insect
politician.
I'd
like
to...
...but
l'm
afraid....
I
don't
know
I'm
saying....
I'm
saying

an
insect...
...who
dreamt
he
was
a
man
But
now
the
dream
is
over...
...and
the
insect
is
awake.
No,
Seth.
I'm
saying...
...l'll
hurt
you
if
you
stay.


Let's

Let's
do
it
now.
Now?
Wait.
I
couldn't
tell
him.
Let's
go,
damn
it.
No!
I
think
we
should
-You're
not
in
the
right
state
of
mind.
I
want
it
out
of
my
body
now.
There
could
be
anything
in
here,
I
don't
know
if

can
Why

I
don't
want

my
body.
Understand?
Well,
okay,

the
story?
She's
pregnant
and
In
the
middle
of
the
night?
We
have
good
reason
to
think
that...
...this
child
will
be
deformed.
-Yeah,
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
Please.
Is
it
your
child?
No.
It's
the--
It's
the
child
of
a

Okay.

into
that,
No.
No.
Wait,

Brundle?
The
baby

Please

kill
me.
I
can't
have
it.

afraid.
Please,

the
baby.
I

Too
bad.

Jeez!

VERONlCA:
Please.
Help
me.
Help
me
be
human.
How?
Well....
I

there...
...and
you

We

together
there.
You,

the
baby.
Together.
No.
We'll
be
the
ultimate
family.
A
family
of

More
