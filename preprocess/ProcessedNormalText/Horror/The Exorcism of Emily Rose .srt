Emily!
You're
the
medical
examiner?
Mr.
Rose?
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Rose...
...but
I
cannot
state
conclusively...
...that
the
cause
of
death
Your
daughter,
she....
Excuse
me,
Father?
Father
Moore.
You'll
have
to
come
with
me.
-Father
Moore!
-Tell
us
about
the
exorcism!
We're
at
Crescent
County
Courthouse.
-What
about
the
parents?
Do
we
charge
them?
No.
Even
the
priest
admits
We
need
a
Christian
on
this.
Preferably
a
Catholic.
Somebody
that
knows
this
shit
...and
who
the
public
will
see
We're
going
after
a
holy
man
here.
Ethan
Thomas.
He's
not
Catholic,
though.
But
the
guy
practically
lives
at
church.
He's
no
choirboy
in
the
courtroom.
He's
a
shrewd
son
of
a
bitch.
All
right,
pull
him
off
whatever
There's
ambition.
She
never
stops.
-Gentlemen,
you
know
Erin
Bruner.
-Hello.
...but
you
proved
me
wrong,
lady.
The
system
worked,
that's
all.
Gentlemen,
you'll
excuse
us,
Have
you
seen
the
news
I
heard
something
about
an
exorcism
The
DA
charged
him
They
offered
a
very
reasonable
plea
Do
not
ask
me
to
take
this--
The
archdiocese
-Why
me?
They
think
you're
smart...
...and
convincing.
They
want
you
to
ask
the
priest
Well,
what
if
he
won't?
This
sounds
like
a
quagmire.
Erin,
the
Van
Hopper
case
Once
again,
you're
a
rising
star.
-Chivas,
neat,
please.
-What
are
you
saying?
...and
the
rising
star
keeps
rising.
The
case
is
yours.
And
just
how
high
I've
been
junior
partner
-It's
not
like
other
firms
haven't
called.
I
want
my
name
on
the
door,
Okay.
Try
to
get
the
deal.
If
the
priest
won't
...the
archdiocese
feels
he
could
So
under
no
circumstances
No,
of
course.
...he'd
be
marking
time
on
death
row
His
tab.
Good
morning,
I'm
Erin
Bruner.
May
I
sit
down?
They
brought
the
chair
I
guess
they
left
it
when
they
decided
My
firm
represents
the
archdiocese.
Yes.
Yes,
I
was
expecting
them
-Why
did
they
choose
you?
-So
you
like
the
spotlight?
I
defended
James
Van
Hopper.
And
now
you've
come
No.
I'm
here
to
make
senior
partner
-Are
you
a
Catholic?
I'm
an
agnostic,
I
guess.
If
you're
not
sure,
then
you
are
one.
I
don't
think
you're
the
right
attorney.
He
can't
get
the
DA
I
won't
be
making
If
you
don't,
the
archdiocese
You'll
be
stuck
in
here
for
the
trial.
Do
you
understand
how
long
It's
been
explained
to
me.
The
DA's
office
doesn't
like
it
when
And
this
prosecutor,
You're
gonna
need
somebody
...and
aggressive
What
would
your
strategy
be
to
defend
-That
depends.
On
how
you
wanna
be
defended.
What's
your
main
concern,
-Is
it
how
you're
being
portrayed?
I'm
not
afraid
of
jail.
What
I
care
about
I
want
people
to
hear
And
what
is
that?
What
really
happened
to
Emily...
...and
why.
If
I
let
you
defend
me...
...will
you
promise
to
let
me
testify
and
And
what
is
the
truth
you
would
tell?
-Was
it
your
fault
she
died?
All
right.
But
only
if
you
agree
to
let
me
do
You're
not
used
to
I'm
sure
our
life
is
very
strange
Not
so
strange.
I
grew
up
in
a
little
town.
But
our
house
wasn't
as
nice
My
mother,
she
raised
me
alone.
She
was
a
schoolteacher,
What
a
wonderful
thing
to
be.
That
was
Emily's
dream,
That's
why
she
went
away
A
lot
of
cats
live
here.
There
are...
...11
now,
I
think.
Emily
always
brought
them
home.
Ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl,
Before
these
troubles
began...
...was
Emily
a
happy
girl?
Oh,
yes.
Before
she
went
away
...my
Emily
was
so
very
happy.
What
is
going
on--?
Girls!
Mama.
Is
it--?
It's
a
scholarship,
Mama.
They
pay
for
it.
This
is
your
dream,
Emily.
You'll
be
leaving
us.
It's
okay.
I'll
be
okay.
I'm
gonna
show
this
to
your
father.
-Counselor.
Thanks
for
meeting
me.
Can
I
buy
you
a
drink,
Mr.
Thomas?
Just
water
for
me,
please.
So...
...the
judge
thinks
we
should
offer
She
feels
the
community
might
be
How
do
you
feel
about
it?
Personally.
My
job
is
to
represent
...and
make
an
effort
to
be
objective.
I
ask
because
I
know
Now
you're
set
to
prosecute
Your
priest
broke
the
law...
...and
a
young
girl
is
dead.
If
he's
a
man
of
God,
then,
personally,
...to
the
laws
of
moral
behavior.
And
forgiveness
and
compassion?
Or
does
that
just
get
in
the
way
If
you
have
compassion
...you'll
persuade
him
to
accept
this:
Charges
reduced
Twelve
months
in
a
county
jail.
Reducible
to
six,
plus
probation,
Somehow
I
expect
But
please
understand
me.
Father
Moore
has
made
it
clear
He
will
not
lie
or
admit
to
something
-And
he
was
never
neglectful
of
Emily.
Have
you
seen
We'll
go
to
trial.
My
client
wants
Good.
So
do
l.
Have
a
good
night,
counselor.
Let
the
record
show
that
the
defendant
...and
that
the
jury
is
seated.
-Mr.
Thomas,
you
may
begin.
Good
morning,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
I'm
the
assistant
district
attorney,
In
the
case
before
you,
...that
the
victim
had
a
serious
medical
We
will
prove
that
the
victim's
...and
psychologically
incapable
Her
care...
...was
then
wholly
entrusted...
...to
that
man,
the
defendant,
She
became
his
responsibility...
...and
he
betrayed
...by
persuading
her
to
abandon
...in
favor
of
religious
treatment:
A
ritual
exorcism,
...allegedly
to
cure
the
victim
We
will
demonstrate
...directly
resulted
I
said
a
moment
ago
We
all
know
what
that
means,
Miss
Bruner,
...is
seated
right
next
And
I
stand
here
That's
not
really
why
I'm
here
on
behalf
of
someone
...and
look
at
you
every
day
...someone
who
can't
take
the
stand
...and
tell
you
what
happened
A
young
girl...
...that
could've
been
your
daughter.
Could've
been
mine.
A
girl
who
trusted
This
is
what
she
looked
like...
...before
the
defendant
began
This
is
a
photograph
taken
of
her
I
stand
here
for
Emily
Rose...
...who
died
horribly...
...at
age
19.
You
won't
be
able
to
see
Emily
sitting
But
I
hope
you'll
remember
her
...and
full
of...
...hopes
and
dreams.
And
as
she
was
when
Father
...and
left
her
to
die.
Thank
you.
Is
the
defense
prepared
I'd
like
to
reserve
...until
the
presentation
As
is
your
privilege.
Prosecution
may
begin.
That
was
already
my
plan.
Thank
you,
Your
Honor.
I've
known
Emily
her
entire
life.
Can
you
describe
Emily
She
was
a
bit
sickly
She
stayed
inside
a
lot,
How
did
she
feel
about
Objection.
I'll
rephrase.
Did
you
talk
to
Emily
Yes.
She
told
me
she
was
excited...
...but
nervous
that
she
would
be
away
This
was
an
overwhelming
change
Did
you
stay
in
touch
Yes.
She
wrote
me
a
letter
...and
she'd
met
a
boy
She
didn't
want
her
mother
...because
her
mother
did
not
...and
had
warned
her
Did
Emily
communicate
with
you
again
Actually,
it
was
her
mother.
She
telephoned
me...
...waking
me
out
of
a
deep
sleep
She
asked
me
to
call
Emily
at
When
Emily
answered,
At
first,
she
just
But
eventually
she
calmed
down
She
said
that
she
was
alone
Her
roommate
had
gone
home.
She
had
awakened...
...and
thought
she
smelled
There
was
no
alarm,
...afraid
there
was
a
fire.
Dr.
Mueller,
what's
your
position
I
am
chairman
of
And
after
you
heard
...what
were
your
initial
thoughts?
At
first,
I
thought
perhaps
Some
type
of
hallucinogen.
But
we
ran
tests
and
found
no
trace
And
the
more
she
explained
...the
more
I
began
to
suspect
Epilepsy
results
from
uncontrolled
In
a
severe,
or
grand
mal,
seizure...
...a
person
may
lose
consciousness
...and
suffer
involuntary
contractions
Is
it
possible
for
a
person
...
to
have
hallucinations
or
perceive
The
muscle
contractions
could
feel
And
it
is
certainly
possible,
...for
a
person
to
perceive
all
sorts
So
suspecting
that
Emily
was
I
administered
What
did
the
EEG
reveal?
It
showed
a
possible
epileptic
focus
Did
this
require
Yes,
I
began
a
medication
schedule
I
also
advised
regular
follow-up
But
Emily
failed
to
keep
She
give
any
reason
for
discontinuing
Yes,
she
told
me
she
was
convinced
It
was
the
conviction
of
her
priest,
Was
it
your
impression
-...entirely--?
Sustained.
After
the
end
of
October...
...did
you
ask
Emily
...filling
her
Gambutrol
Yes.
She
said
that
Father
Moore
had
And
what,
in
your
medical
opinion...
...was
the
result
I
believe
Father
Moore's
suggestion
Objection,
Your
Honor!
The
witness
is
asserting
outrageous
Technically
correct,
but
I'll
allow
it
Thank
you,
Dr.
Mueller.
Your
witness.
You
said
you
observed
a

Doesn't
this
imply
what
you
observed
Yes,
that's
also
possible.
Would
Father
Moore's
advice
to
stop
...if
Emily
were,
in
fact,
Of
course.
But
that's
not
Really.
When
Emily
saw
objects
move
...and
felt
an
invisible
presence
...was
she
experiencing
symptoms
Not
typical,
no.
Are
they
typical
indications
-Say,
for
example,
psychosis?
But
isn't
psychosis
an
entirely
different
-Yes,
in
my--
...what
parts
of
Emily's
experiences
...while
ignoring
those
which
-Objection.
Argumentative.
No
further
questions.
We
have
to
work
fast.
They're
only
giving
me
an
hour
Listen.
Before
we
get
started,
...something
I
should've
said
to
you
Okay.
There
are
forces
Dark,
powerful
forces.
Just
be
careful,
Erin.
I
see.
Look--
Father,
you
don't
have
to
worry
I'm
an
agnostic,
remember?
Demons
exist,
Your
involvement
in
this
trial
might
Look,
Father,
...but
you
need
to
be
worried
Ethan
Thomas
is
using
the
medical
...and
I
have
to
be
prepared
...with
what
little
time
we
have,
I
think
Now,
what
I
need
from
you
is
more
Specific
details
of
how
it
progressed
Well,
after
the
first
incident...
...she
was
sent
to
the
university
Emily
once
told
me
that
in
her
...but
at
the
hospital
So
she
believed...
...that
her
possession
Yeah,
I
think
she
did.
And
after
that,
things
just
went
Emily!
Emily?
Oh,
my
God.
Emily?
Don't
touch
me.
Jason,
please...
...don't
leave
me.
And
I
never
did
leave
her.
I
stayed
until
the
end.
So
much
of
what
we
shared
...but
I
wouldn't
give
up
She
woke
me
up,
you
know?
To
things
I
never
felt
before,
I
never
knew
how
dead
I
was

my
courtroom
day

sorry,
Your
Honor,

Ready
to
proceed?
Yes,
Your
Honor.
Dr.
Briggs,
please

I
have
advanced

and
neurology
...and
I
have
had
three
books

the
fields
of

What
was
the
cause
of
death,
The
decedent
expired
due
to
a

did
her
body
shut
down?
The

found

numerous
physical
traumas
...which
severely
inhibited
her
ability
In
other
words,
her

...from
the
injuries
it
was
sustaining,
How
did
Emily
get
these
injuries?
Some
were
the
result
...and
some
were
self-inflicted.
And
why,
in
your
opinion,
...and
why
did
she
stop
eating?
Upon
review
...I
concluded
that
Emily's

a
condition
known
as
This
is
a
rare
development,

one
that
I
have
witnessed

believe

developed
into

can
be

been,
In
your
opinion,

mean,

But
send
the

file
Ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury...
...as
you
know
by
now,
...and
I
represent
the
defendant,
Mr.
Thomas
has
contended
...from
a
serious
medical
condition...
...that
required
medical
treatment,
He
has
asserted
that
any
attempt

help
Emily
by
anything
...was
not
only
inappropriate,
I'm
now
gonna
ask
...to
what
our
evidence
Medical
treatment
was
not

she
simply
did
not
suffer
She
was
neither

hope
Some
of
you
may
find
yourself

those
of

may
not
believe

you
will
see
that
after

Moore
simply
tried
...using
an
approach
that
he,
...was
her
only
chance
for
relief.
And
we
will
show
that
...and
his
sincere
love
for
Emily...
...there
was
nothing
he
could've
done
Are
you
okay?
Aren't
you
gonna
eat
anything?
She
said
it
was
terrible
to
hear
She
was
always
hungry,
Who

she
mean
by
"they"?
The
forces
that
were
That
were
inside
her.
You
know,
the
demons.
Tell
us
what
else
happened
I
walked
her
back
to
her
dorm...
...and
she
seemed
really
nervous
So
I
held
her
for
a
while,
I
fell
asleep,
but
when
I
woke
up,
Emily?
Hey.
Can
you
hear
me?
I
called
her
father,
and
he
told
me
Jason
and
I
put
Emily
to
bed...
...hoping
she
would
sleep.
And
when
did
Father
Moore
Emily
stayed
home
after
that.
She
didn't
return
to
school,
Eventually,
when
she
didn't
get
better,
When
he
arrived,
...to
see
if
Emily
was
awake.
Emily?
Can
I
come
in?
-Our
Father,
who
art
in
heaven--
Father
Moore
is
here.
--as
it
is
in
heaven.
Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread....
Emily,
can
you
hear
me?
Let's
get
her
off
the
floor.
Alice,
no!
You've
suffered
a
terrible
loss,
So
thank
you
for
being
here
today.
Sir,
do
you
often
read
the
Bible?
-Yes,
I
do.
What
about
the
DSM?
The
Diagnostic
and
Statistical

referred
to

you
read
that?
So
you're
not
aware

refusal
to
eat

The
witness
just
said
-Sustained.
...are
you
aware
...specifically
a
locking
up
...is
a
known
symptom
of
psychosis?
No.
I
haven't
studied
these
things.
Have
you
ever
visited
...or
a
hospital
for
the
mentally
ill?
Once.
My
aunt
was
in
one
Really?
So
there's
a
history
I
suppose.
Sir,
if
you
saw
someone
...on
a
street
corner,
would
you
say
-Probably,
yes.
...that
the
behavior
you
saw
...could
not
be
the
behavior
of
I
don't
know.
She
never
had
It
just
didn't
feel
that
way
to
me
-And
you
trusted
him,
right?
He
is
our
parish
priest.
Fair
enough.
And
after
that
night,
...put
your
daughter
entirely
Yes.
We
had
done
all
we
could.
We
said
she
was
in
his
hands
now...

and

you.

I've

Yes.
He

I
need.
With
all
of

could
you

asked

Dr.

I
recognize

-May
I
sit?
You're
losing.
I
had
hoped
Father
Moore
...but
I
don't
wanna
see
him
How
do
you
know
him?
Well,
I
was
his
parishioner
...about
15
years
ago.
I
hadn't
seen
or
heard
of
him
for
years
But
he
needed
help,
so....
What
kind
of
help,
doctor?
He
wanted
a
medical
perspective
...you
know,
one
that
he
knew,
...to
observe
Emily's
physical
During
the
exorcism.
Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Can
you
help
our
case?
That
girl
was
not
schizophrenic...
...and
she
was
not
epileptic,
I've
seen
hundreds
of
people

can
be
terrible
afflictions,
But
what
you
saw
that
night
in
Emily,
God,
if
I'd
known,
I
started
praying
again
I
examined
that
girl
before
I
drove
She
was
lucid...
...and
she
was
completely
aware
When
she
wasn't
in
his
grip,
she
was
The

of

You'll
testify
to
all
of

in
detail?
Everything
you
saw?
Send
me

files
Thank
you,
doctor.
We
need
this.
Before
he
was
arrested,
He
asked
me
to
take
care
of
it.
It's
your
burden
now.
One
more
thing.

Father
Moore
ask
you
He
was
already
trying

from

I
told
him,
as
a
doctor,
Dr.
Cartwright's
going
to
testify.
Don't
you
get
it?
He's
not
just
an
eyewitness
He
can
also
refute
the
prosecution's
When
do
I
get
to
testify?
I
don't
know.
Let's
take
this
No.
What
matters
most
is
Emily's
story,
I
understand.
Have
you
thought
about
About
dark
forces
Yes,
I
have.
That
day,
after
Briggs
testified...
...I
was
feeling
awful.
And
I
went
out
for
a
walk
...and
I
was
thinking
about
"What
if
demons
really
do
exist?"
And
wondering
what
that
Because
God
knows,
And
I
saw
something
It
was
a
gold
locket...
...with
the
initials
E.
C.B.
My
middle
name
is
Christine.
Erin
Christine
Bruner.
And
of
all
the
people
walking
by
What
are
the
chances
of
that?
I
don't
know,
maybe
it
was
a
sign.
Or
maybe
it
was
just
some
But
it
made
me
feel...
...Iike
no
matter
what
mistakes
...at
that
moment,
I
was
exactly
Like
I
was
on
the
right
path.
You
sound
more
like
a
mystic
Are
you
wearing
the
locket
now?
No.
You
should.
The
archdiocese
They're
just
afraid
Testify
to
some
medieval-sounding
They're
expecting
me
I've
just
decided
Why
not?
If
the
archdiocese
...they
need
you
to
walk
out
of
here
I
believe
a
jury
will
find
you
...and
when
Dr.
Cartwright
...and
refutes
the
prosecution's
...we'll
get
an
acquittal.
And
everyone
will
thank
me
for
it.
Emily!
God
help
me.
Do
you
swear
to
tell
the
truth,
I
do.
Father
Moore,
before
you
could

had
to
get

freezing.

It's
a

It's
an
inversion
of

...which
is
traditionally

I
thought
I
smelled
Only
later
did
I
connect
it...

I

that
that

been
perceived
by
Emily.

Mr.

you

Forgive
me,
Your

Father,
did
you
understand

believe
it
was
Like
the
demonic
force
-Yes.
I
believe
the

like
a
ghost,
-Did
it
excite
your

Father?
So
this

you
began

It's

Inside

the

I
made

Why
would
you
make
such
a

Ever

have
used

provide

Will

I

Watch

In

After
a
few
moments,
...but
the
exorcism
Emily
was
taken
to
her
room
The
whole
thing
Describe
her
behavior
from
the
night
...until
the
time
of
her
death.
Violence
towards
others
and
herself.
Sometimes
she
screamed
She
drove
her
head
through
windows,
Tried
to
bite
holes
in
the
walls,
...as
you
saw
in
-You
witnessed
this?
I
tried
to
visit
every
day...
...and
the
family
told
me
the
rest.
Did
you
attempt
another
exorcism?
I
wanted
to,
but
Emily
refused.
And
without
the
consent
...the
exorcism
ritual
Did
you
encourage
her
to
eat?
Yes,
every
time
I
saw
her...
...but
the
few
times
she
tried,
Seemed
like
she
couldn't
swallow,
What
about
medical
care?
I
wanted
her
to
continue.
I
never
said
That
would
be
wrong.
But
you
did
suggest
she
stop
Yes.
After
the
exorcism,
She
told
me
that
the
drugs
After
all,
she
was
on
Gambutrol
...when
her
so-called
symptoms
Ultimately,
we
both
felt
that
...and
that
she
had
to
see
this
...by
faith
alone.
The
dual
voices
we
just
heard
...you're
certain
that
they
were
both
Yes.
Yes,
I
heard
them.
Have
you
tampered
No.
No,
I
have
not.
No
further
questions
at
this
time.
Mr.
Thomas.
Father
Moore,
you
consider
this
tape
I
think
it's
a
record
...that
Emily
was
possessed.
Signs
of
possession,
By
"signs
of
possession,"
would
you
...we
might
assume
And
the
vocalization
of
two
Yes.
Among
other
signs
that
l
...while
the
tape
was
playing.
Things
you
can't
hear
We'll
just
have
to
take
-Your
Honor.
I
apologize.
...are
you
aware
that
she
underwent
Yes.
Yes.
Her
family
is
very
devout.
And
in
that
training,
did
she
study
Yes,
I
think
that's
right.
Might
have
even
studied
Aramaic,
...which,
according
to
the
transcripts,
She
spoke
Aramaic
on
the
tape.
But
it
was
offered
as
an
elective
I
have
the
school's
curriculum
No.
I'll
accept
that
she
might
have
And
according
to
...German
was
the
foreign
language
I
don't
know.
If
you
say
so.
So
that
covers
the
strange
languages
Did
I
miss
any?
-No.
We've
already
established
You
said
it's
not
your
field.
But
are
you
aware
of
the
dual
sets
of
-No.
...the
superior
vocal
cords,
which
are
No.
So
you
didn't
know
that
...as
part
of
their
religious
training,
...to
activate
both
sets
No,
I
didn't
know
that.
Well,
now
that
you
do
know,
...that
Emily,
in
her
psychotic
state...
...might
have
activated
both
sets
...so
as
to
achieve
the
amazing
effect
Her
state
was
not
psychotic.
Father
Moore,
you
told
us
...you
actually
saw,
once
again,
-...or
demonic
apparition,
am
I
right?
But
we
couldn't
see
him
-No,
of
course
not.
So
that
would
be
another
-...your
tape
doesn't
prove,
correct?
Where
is
your
dark
figure,
Father?
Is
he
here
now?
-Your
Honor.
I
have
nothing
further.
Does
the
defense
wish
to
redirect?
No,
Your
Honor,
but
we
reserve
Very
well.
Your
Honor,
my
next
witness
If
we
could
take
a
short
recess
You've
made
this
court
wait
before,
Your
Honor,
please.
Dr.
Cartwright
came
to
us
...as
an
eyewitness
to
the
exorcism
He
can

Your
Honor,
the
defense
has
already
...in
dramatic
fashion.
We
have
absorbed
some
I
think
we'll
take
some
time
Court
is
adjourned
-You
can't
find
him?
I
called
his
office,
I
called
his
house.
Okay.
Go
to
the
hospital,
ask
around.
What
the
hell
happened?
Tell
Father
Moore
I'm
sorry.
Tell
him
I
know
the
demons
are
real
...for
standing
and
speaking
Tell
him
I
know
what
they
can
do.
-Cartwright's
dead.
Are
you
drunk?
-Not
yet,
but
I'm
working
on
it.
-What
the
hell
were
you
thinking?
You
told
me
you'd
talk
him
out
Instead,
you
put
on
a
freak
show
...and
a
dead
girl
...and
your
client
testifies
that
the
We'll
be
lucky
if
I
had
a
doctor
Besides
that,
Father
Moore's
Did
you
forget
the
archdiocese
The
archdiocese
isn't
on
trial.
I
swore
an
oath
to
do
Spare
me
the
law
school
pieties,
You
cashed
in
your
conscience
-People
can
change.
It's
not
over.
I
can
put
Mr.
Rose
on
the
stand...
...to
corroborate
Father
Moore
And
there
are
the
girls.
They
all
look
like
superstitious
rubes.
Thomas
will
rip
them
to
pieces.
You'll
be
worse
off
than
you
are
now,
You're
gonna
replace
me
You've
screwed
it
up
But
the
archdiocese
feels
...would
only
draw
more
But
just
so
we're
clear,
Bruner...
...if
you
put
that
priest
You've
been
crying.
-Dr.
Cartwright
is
dead.
He
was
killed.
I
know
he
was
your
friend.
We've
lost.
Without
his
testimony,
it's
over.
No.
No,
no,
no,
it
isn't
over.
We're
telling
-lt
can't
be
worth
all
this.
Just
let
me
go
back
on
the
stand
-I
can't
do
that.
You
must.
Erin,
you
once
said
that
you
felt
Don't
stray
from
that
path.
Here,
take
this.
-What
is
this?
And
then
decide
I
saw
your
eyes
today
in
court
when
It's
not
going
to
stop
Are
you
gonna
make
a
statement?
Do
you
believe
it
was
the
devil?
Is
the
defense
ready
to
proceed?
Yes,
Your
Honor.
The
defense
The
witness
is
reminded
-When
did
you
last
see
Emily
alive?
Her
mother,
Maria,
called
me
-Why
did
she
ask
to
see
you?
Did
Emily
explain
to
you
Yes.
She
said
she'd
written
it
the
...and
that
it
was
important
Father
Moore,
I
believe
that
one
day
-So
she
loved
God.
Father
Moore,
if
Emily
loved
God...
...if
she
was
so
good
and
so
devout,
-...allowed
this
to
happen?
What
is
the
relevance
Father
Moore's
belief
...in
establishing
his
and
Emily's
And
that
mutual
understanding
...whether
Father
Moore
was,
I'm
going
to
allow
it.
Your
Honor,
you're
not
really
gonna
...about
why
God
would
allow
The
objection
has
been
overruled.
Again,
Father
Moore:
Why
did
God
allow
Emily
to
become
I
can
let
Emily
answer
that.
"Last
night,
on
Allhallows'
Eve...
...Father
Moore
tried
to
cast
They
refused
to
go.
After
the
attempted
exorcism...."
I
was
taken
to
my
room,
I
awoke
a
few
hours
later,
"Again,
I
heard
a
voice
It
was
the
Blessed
Holy
Mother
And
when
I
looked
at
her...
...she
smiled
at
me
and
said:
'Emily,
heaven
is
not
blind
She
said
the
Virgin
Mary
spoke
to
her
-Yes.
I
believe
Emily
spoke
the
truth.
Please
continue.
"I
asked
the
Blessed
Mother,
Why
did
the
demons
"She
said,
'I
am
sorry,
Emily.
The
demons
are
going
to
stay
Then
she
said,
...free
of
your
bodily
form...
...or
you
can
choose
You
will
suffer
greatly.
But
through
you,
many
will
come
to
The
choice
is
yours.
"'
I
choose
to
stay.
"ln
the
end,
Through
my
experience...
...people
will
know
People
say
that
God
is
dead.
But
how
can
they
think
that...
...if
I
show
them
the
devil?"
Did
you
see
these
wounds
on
both
Yes.
Yes,
the
wounds
And
did
you
attach
any
supernatural
I
believe
they
were
stigmata.
By
that,
you
mean
...that
correspond
to
the
crucifixion
Yes.
Stigmata
are
a
sign,
a
mark
After
that
night,
why
do
you
think
I
believe
she'd
accepted
her
fate.
Is
there
anything
else
No.
The
defense
rests.
Father
Moore
attaches
...to
the
wounds
Why?
Because
he
sees
them
as
confirmation
That
Emily
was
a
saint,
I'm
afraid
the
truth
Because
the
truth
is,
by
the
time
...Emily
had
already
shown
...and
simply
did
so
again
...surrounding
the
Rose
family
farm.
Father
Moore's
beliefs
are
based
on
Emily
suffered
...not
because
she
was
a
saint.
I'm
a
man
of
faith.
And
in
here,
And
these
are
the
facts
of
this
case:
Emily
Rose
had
epilepsy,
And,
given
time,
But
it
didn't.
Why?
Because
Father
...that
she
wasn't
ill,
And
in
the
weeks
...when
she
was
clearly
in
need
...he
failed
to
have
her
hospitalized.
So...
...the
defense
has
given
us
...creative
explanation
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Because
the
fact
is,
it
wasn't
the
devil
It
was
the
defendant.
Counselor.
Ethan
Thomas
calls
himself
I,
on
the
other
hand,
Angels
and
demons.
God
and
the
devil.
These
things
either
exist,
Are
we
all
alone
in
this
life?
Or
are
we
not
alone?
Either
thought
is
astonishing.
Do
I
really
believe
that
this
tragedy
To
be
honest,
I
don't
know.
But
I
cannot
deny
that
it's
possible.
The
prosecution
...that
Emily's
psychotic
...because
facts
leave
no
room
But
this
trial
isn't
about
facts.
This
trial
is
about
possibilities.
Is
it
a
fact
that
Emily
...as
Dr.
Adani
suggests?
A
person
who's
more
likely,
by
her
I
can't
say
that,
but
the
question
is:
Is
it
possible?
Is
it
a
fact
that
Gambutrol
...so
that
the
exorcism
ritual
I
can't
be
sure
of
that.
But
is
it
possible?
Is
it
a
fact
that
Emily
And
that
after
her
exorcism,
...so
that
we
might
believe
A
world
where
the
spiritual
realm
I
can't
say
that's
a
fact.
But
ask
yourself:
Is
it
possible?
It's
what
Emily
believed.
It's
what
Father
Moore
believed.
And
that
sincere
belief
is
what
Now,
for
the
most
Is
Father
Richard
Moore
guilty...
...beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
Did
he,
in
fact,
neglect
...that
her
death
No!
That
is
not
a
fact.
It
is
not
a
fact
It
is
not
a
fact
Facts...
...Ieave
no
room
for
possibilities.
The
only
fact...
...the
only
thing
I
know
...is
that
Father
Moore
He
did
everything
in
his
power
He
has
risked
his
very
freedom
Ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury...
...in
my
job
I
sometimes
Father
Richard
Moore
Don't
send
a
good
man
to
prison.
I'm
not
asking
that
you
believe
I'm
simply
asking
that
you
believe
Madam
Foreman,
We
have,
Your
Honor.
Please
read
the
verdict
out
loud.
"ln
the
case
of
The
People
...we,
the
jury,
find
the
defendant...
...guilty
of
negligent
homicide."
The
court
thanks
the
jury
Sentencing
for
this
case
Your
Honor,
if
it
pleases
the
court...
...Father
Moore
requested
...that
if
found
guilty,
Yes,
I
recall
that.
Does
the
prosecution
have
any
Very
well.
Father
Richard
Moore,
-...which
has
been
found
against
you?
And
do
you
understand
That
you
may,
under
the
law,
be
Yes,
I
do.
Are
there
any
statements
...before
I
impose
this
sentence?
-No,
Your
Honor.
Excuse
me,
Your
Honor...
...but
the
jury
would
like
to
make
-...regarding
the
sentence.
Sit
down,
counselor.
It's
only
a
recommendation,
We
recommend
a
sentence
I'll
accept
that.
You
are
guilty,
Father
Moore.
And
you
are
free
to
go.
-This
court
is
dismissed.
Thank
you.
Well,
you
shocked
us
all.
Everyone
at
the
firm
sees
this
The
archdiocese
is
pleased.
They
feel
the
trial
has
raised
Have
you
seen
the
news?
There's
our
priest,
...right
next
to
you.
Just
like
James
Van
Hopper.
All
right,
I'll
say
it.
I
was
wrong.
But
I'm
ready
to
make
it
right.
I'm
offering
you
Keep
it.
Will
you
be
able
to
return
I
can't
go
back.
Not
now.
Once
you've
looked
...I
think
you
carry
it
with
you
What
about
you?
I
believe
you've
seen
I
don't
know.
I'm
not
sure
what
I've
seen.
-Who
chose
the
epitaph?
It's
from
the
second
chapter
Emily
recited
it
to
me
