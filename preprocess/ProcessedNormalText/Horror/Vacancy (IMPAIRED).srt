of
a
bitch.
There's
a
goddamn
racoon
Jesus.
Well,
better
to
kill
us
than
get
Well,
we're
still
alive.
I
can
tell
by
the
pissy
look

This
isn't
the
interstate.
It
was
all
backed
up.
To
where?

Can
you
hear
that?
I
think
the
engine
Well,
it's
kind
of
late
Should've
stopped
Yeah,

I
popped
I
thought
I
could
make
it
Where

we?
Boy,

You
were
mumbling
I
dreamt
you
were
We
were
at
my
parents'
and
my
mother
You
started
screaming
At
least
you
were
That's
kind
of
an
improvement.
Shit.
You

I
keep
telling
you
how
You
ought
to
just
kind
of
bite
into
It
hurts
my
teeth.
It's
not
anything.
You
want
me
to
drive
for
a
while?
Why
don't
you
just
go
ahead


Remember
how
Charlie
used
I'm
tired,
David.

See,
I
think
that
should
Why
didn't
you
just
I
don't
know.
Guess
I
just
wanted
to
See
just
how
big
a
bitch
I
just
thought
it
would

Shit.

Is
that
something?


Do
you
think
they're
closed?
Since
1957.
That's
too
bad,
because
Look,
if
you're
too
tired,
I'll
drive.
Okay.
See,
that
town
there,
Elida.
You
were
asleep,
but
we
went
Well,
that
should
put
us
I
mean,
that's
a
town.
If
that's
really
where
we
are.
I
think
that
we're
headed
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
It's
okay.
You

I
actually
We're
on
our
way
He's
trying
to
tell
you

really
easy
to
get
turned

tell
you
what.
I'll
check
the
engine
Really?
Thanks.
Okay,
great.
That
would
be
great.
Yeah,
I
went
off
the
road
there
I
think
I
hit
a
low
spot.

Yeah.
Thanks,
man.
Is
he
gonna
fix
it?

What
do
you
think?
Rock
must
have

it.
Yeah,
she'll
drive
fine,
You
might
wanna
have
someone
I'll
do
that.
Thanks.
Oh,

Hell,

should
pay
you
for

you
need
help
Yes.
if
you
could
just
point
us
towards
Oh.
Well,
you
don't
want
Downey,
then.
I'll
tell
you
what
you
do.
And
you
follow
it
down
until
you
hit
You
take
that.
Keep
going
It'll
be
a
four-lane
there.
Make
a
left
on
that
and
that'll
Okay.
Thank
you.
And
you
know
what?
Man,
I'd
feel
Thanks
for
staying
out
so
late
Well,
you
just
bought
yourself
Because
every
day's
Owner
makes
me
say
that.
Here
you
go.
And
drive
careful.



Guess
I
ought
to
buy
you
So
how
far
did
he
say
He
didn't.
And
I
can't
even

David.
That's
fucking...
You
know,
it
was
a
fucking
racoon.
I
mean,
Jesus
Christ,


Oh,
what
the
hell?

Son
of
a
bitch.
Son
of
a
bitch.
So
much
for
being
able
to
God.
Perfect.
No
signal.
Damn
it.
Can't
a
car
run
without
a
fan?
Okay,
give
it
a
try
for
me,
It's
not
gonna
work.
Jesus
Christ.
Would
you
just
give
it

Goddamn
it.
So
how
far
back
I
don't
know.
About
a
mile?
Kind
of
a
long
walk
Yeah.
I
mean,
I
guess
and
hope
some
idiots
like
us
come
I
didn't
get
us
lost.
No.
You
slept
for
300
miles,
Fuck!
Well...
at
least
we
know
there's
Oh,
yeah,
the
guy
that
Well,
you
know,
you
could
Asshole.
Grow
a
penis.

Never
see
stars
anymore.
Kind
of
nice
out
here,
really.
I
bet
Charlie
We
should've
We
never
went
anywhere.
Why
do
you
do
that?
Every
time
I
mention
his
name,
Well,
stop
mentioning
his
name.
I'd
rather
just
Okay,
you
know
what,
David?



He
said
he
was
getting
Shit.
Look,
let's
just
You
can
sleep
on
the
hood
Maybe
they'll
know
Oh,
God.


You've
got
to
be


I
want
to
go.
It's
okay.
Let's
just
go
back
What
are
you
doing?


Sorry.
Hey,
folks.
How
can
I
help
you?
Everything
okay

Oh.
Can
we
just...?
Can
we
just
go?
Sorry.
Things
get
a
little
boring
I
believe
that.
Say,
there's
a
mechanic
He
helped
us
with
our
car
I
think
he's
gone
He'll
probably
be
back
Right.
Well,
I
was
wondering
Because
the
car
actually
We
just
walked
up
here.
I
sure
can't.
I
sure
can't.
Do
you
know
Hmm.
There's
Clark's,
about
20
miles
east.
Well,
may
I
borrow

you
need
them.
It's
real.
No,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
Mm-hm.


Oop,
oop.
Thank
you.
Trouble
is...
Clark's
won't
be
open
either.
Not
this
late.
So
I
guess
I
don't
Not
if
you
need
a
garage.
Yeah.
We
do.
But
like
I
said,
guy
over
there
if
you
can
wait
that
long.
I'm
sure
he
can
Meanwhile,
I'm
wide
open
here.
DAVID:
Yeah?
Okay.
Thanks.
Well,

can
either
stay
here,
