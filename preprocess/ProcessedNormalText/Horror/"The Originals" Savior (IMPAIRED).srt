Freya:
100
years
a
Christmas
ball
here.
I
wanted
so
much
but
I
thought
I
was
forever
always
looking
in.
I
know
this
hasn't
been
but,
well,
it's
already
been
I
suppose
some
things
You
look...
Don't
say
tired.
You've
lived
long
enough
a
woman
she
looks
tired.
I
was
going
to
say
Ha.
A
penny
for
your
thoughts.
I
was
thinking
about
you
and
what
Rebekah
said.
Is
she
right?
as
this
fragile
thing
to
protect
me
from
Aurora...
Don't.
Please.
When
I
think
of
all
the
ways
She
didn't.
Klaus,
she
didn't...
Because
of
you.
I've
lost
count
you've
been
there
for
me
and
everyone
you
care
about,
but
today,
you
saved
someone
who
doesn't
mean
a
thing
to
you.
Why?
Because
you
wished
it.
Because
what's
important
to
you
is
important
to
me.
What
makes
you
happy
makes
What
scares
you
I
do
not
wish
to
watch
you
What
do
you
wish?
Heh.
No.
No,
no!
Finn!
All
right.
Y'all
wanted
me.
You
got
me,
for
pomp
and
circumstance.
Our
city
is
collapsing,
and
I'm
gonna
need
all
Tristan:
Congratulations,
The
regent
witch
How
grand.
Let
me
guess...
Lord
Tristan
de
Martel.
You
know,
I've
always
but
cemeteries
I
love.
Churches
celebrate
fairy
tales,
guardian
angels,
patron
saints,
but
cemeteries
hold
that
not
one
of
those
things
can
Yeah.
So
your
Strix
vampires,
tailing
me,
listening
to
me,
so
they
know
I'm
not
and
I'm
sick
and
tired
falling
victim
to
the
trash
that
The
Originals
Now
normal
people
can't
but
I
will.
I
can,
and
I
will,
so...
You
guys
keep
watching
me,
but
know
for
sure
I'm
watching
you,
too.
That's
very
brave.
A
vigilante
witch
Yeah.
Or
so
it
seems,
but
I
know
someone
you
do
fear.
So
if
you
don't
do
as
I
ask,
I'm
certain
Finn
Mikaelson
will.
