Great.
Turn
that
shite
off.
That's
frightening.
Listen,
we
don't
have
to
do
this,
We
can
head
back
and
stay
in
town.
Get
wasted,
go
to
a

dance.
Now
that
is
frightening.
You're
right,
we
don't
have
to
do
this.
She's
a
piece
of
work,
man.
She
always
Well,

Juno.
You

here.
Oh.
Let

Wow!
Everything
is
going

Give
me
these.
Thanks.

OK?
Ooh,

at
a
time,
eh?
Hey,

I'm
calling

You

We're
starving.

What
have
you
got?
Sam.
Sam.
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
letter.
Oh,
Sarah,
look,
You
know,
mid-terms
and...
You
know,
Sam
is
going
to
be

No!

Please
tell

it's

So,
Beth...
I
hear
it
all
starts
falling
Is
that
what
they
teach
you
at
medical

Cheeky
bitch!
Can
anyone
make
me
feel

Oh,
here
we
go.

Hi,
you
must
be
the
teacher.
Juno's
protg.
I
always
thought
Juno
Oh,
nice.
I'm
well
able
to
handle
myself,
I've
heard
about
you.
You're
that
Base
jumping.
You
So
you
live
in
America
now?
Ran
out
of
things
to
jump
I'm
always
searching
for

Sure
you'd
know
all
about
that.
Juno
showed
me
a
photo
I
found
this
classic
picture.

Oh,
no!
-
Look
at
the
state
of
us!
Sexy!
Love

Used

Come

you
bastard.
So,
have
you

I
saw
it
in
a
book
once.

as
well
have

If
you're
a
caver,
jumper,
climber...
...you
just
do
it
and
not
give
a
shite.
Or

thing
that's
bigger
JUNO:You
want
adventure,
Holly?
What?
Holly,
tomorrow
is
going
to
be
awesome.

Take

You

Sort

Different...

Oh,
my
God.

Oh,
my
Jesus!

Don't
say
a
fucking
word,
It
was
a
Christmas
present.
Shut
up.

What
about
you
Holly?
Got
a
man?
I'm
a
sports
fuck
like
Juno.

What?
HOLLY:But
when
I'm
older,
JUNO:Beth,
did
Sarah



Wakey.
Wakey.
I
feel
like
road
kill.
Five
minutes.

Good
morning,
my
little
ones.
Good
morning.
Is
that
what
you
call
it?
Holly!
We're
leaving
at
seven.
Don't
be
late.
Try
that.
The
queen
is
dead.
Long
live...
the
fucking
queen.

JUNO:Beth,
you're
not
driving.
-
If
you
drive
we'll
never
get
there.
-
Come
on.
-
Go
on.
-
There
you
go.
I'll
drive.
Right?
Ladies,
group
photo.
You'd
better
hurry
it
up.
I
look
like
shit.
We
all
look
like
shit.

Hat?
No

No
hat,
no

Run,
run,
run,
run.
ALL:
Sausage!

Sarah,
slow
down
a
bit.
She's
having
fun.
Whoa!
Turn,
turn,
turn
there.
-
Let's
off
road.
You
should
have
some
water.
Trying
to
set
this
watch
is
impossible.

Leave
it
alone.
My

are
you
sure

Relax,
I've
never
been
lost
in
my
life.
-
So
have
you
done
these
caves
before?
But
they
are
only

I
wasn't.
The
only
danger
is

Nice

HOLLY:This
one
time
in
Galway.
a
priest
chased
me
That
was
brilliant.
-
I
shouldn't
have
wasted
the
effort,
though.
Rebecca,
leave
her
alone.
OK,
guys,
let's
get
moving.
SAM:
Come
on,
keep
up.
SAM:
Hey,
Holly,
wait
up.
BETH:
Oi,
Carter,
get
to
the
back.
JUNO:
You
finally
caught
up
with
me.
-
Juno,
are
we
there
yet?
When
we
reach
it,
we
follow
it
How
does
she
know
there's
a
river
up
ahead?
She
can
probably
smell
it.
She
came
up
here
last
week
It's
rule
number
one
-
-
And
rule
number
two?
You
think
it's
dark
when
you
turn
out
the
lights.
-
You
can
get
dehydration,
disorientation...
-
...claustrophobia...
...panic
attacks,
visual
and
aural
deterioration...

Hey!
Eurgh.
Yeah,
lovely,
Holly.
-
Don't
touch
it.
-
What
do
you
think
did
that,
Sam?
What
is
this?
Nature
Detectives?
-
It
could
have
been
Big
Foot.
Come
on.
This
is
it.
-
You're
having
a
laugh!
I'm
an
English
teacher,
You'll
be
fine.
JUNO:OK,
Sarah,
Beth,
you're
up
next.
Do
what
she
does
and
you'll
be
fine.
Holly,
safety
first.
-
You
OK?
See
you
down
there.
REBECCA:Make
sure
your
cow's
tail
is
locked
Look,
I
have
done
this
before,
you
know?
-
I'm
only
looking
after
you.
JUNO:You
gotta
see
this
place.
It's
beautiful!
JUNO:You
won't
believe
this,
Beth.
Shit,
shit,
shit.
Oh,
my
God,
I'm
gonna
die.

Ah,
piece
of
piss.
Oh,
my
God!
It's
incredible.

Clear!
-

Shit,
move!
Holly,
you
do
this
safely,
Take
it
slow
and
easy.
HOLLY:Juno.



It's
OK.
It's
OK.
It's
OK.
They're
gone.
They're
gone
now.
Look.
HOLLY:
50
bats.

Holly,
fuck
off.
Which
way?
There's
only
one
way
out
of
this
chamber
OK.
JUNO:
It's
a
drop.

JUNO:
OK?
JUNO:
Holly,
chuck
us
your
bag.

SARAH:
Oh,
my
God!



Find
anything
good?
-
Jesus
Christ!
-
Holly,
would
you
take
a
break?
This
cave
is
a
lot
Hey?
Not
hungry.
Are
you
OK?
Juno,
I
won't
break.
I'm
fine.
-
I
asked
you
for
this.
Um,
Sarah?
I
haven't
had
a
chance
really
sorry
I
didn't
stay
around
longer
Anyway...
...we're
all
here
for
you
now,
OK?
Yeah.
Look,
sorry.
I'm
feeling
a
bit
out
of
it.
So
I'm
just
going
to
Yeah,
OK.
Why
don't
you
try
and
find
us
Hey,
don't
go
too
far.
What's
up
with
her?
She's
fine.

I've
found
the
next
passage!
-
That's
it?
It's
a
bit
small,
isn't
it?
-
I
don't
get
this.
This
is
not
how
I
imagined
it
That's
why
I
don't
trust
books.
Something
wrong?
-
No.
HOLLY:I'm
taking
point,
guys.
Careful.
Just
find
the
way
through.



Sarah?
-
Shit.
Yes.
Shit!

Shit!
Sarah?
Guys,
it's
Sarah,
I
am
stuck!
BETH:All
right,
Sarah.

I
can't
fucking
relax.
Fuck,
fuck!
Sarah,
you
have
to
calm
down
and
the
only
way
OK,
breathe
slowly.

I
can't.
I
can't.
-
I
can't
fucking
breathe.
Just
listen
to
my
voice,
yeah?
Sarah,
I'm
coming.
I'm
coming
back.
Sarah,
OK?
Listen
to
me,
keep
breathing.
OK?
Hey.
Hey,
hey.
OK.
OK.
OK.
-
Look
here
at
me,
Sarah,
hey?
What
are
you
so
worried
about,
Sarah?
OK,
breathe.
Breathe,
OK?
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Listen
to
me.
-
Listen
to
me.
What
are
you
so
afraid
of?
Youcan
move.
The
worst
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
This
is
just
a
poxy
cave
and
there's
OK?
OK?
Hey.
Hey,
listen,
listen.
Listen
to
me,
you'll
love
this
one.
God
damn
it,
let
me
hear
you
say
it.
What
do
you
do?
OK,
that's
better.
Come
on.
OK,
OK.
All
right,
we're
going
to
move
now.
We're
going
to
move
slowly.
OK,
come
on.
Just
slowly.
Pull
on
me,
OK?
The
rope
bag.
I
forgot
the
rope
bag.
OK.

OK,
fuck
the
rope
bag.
OK,
move,
now!
Now!
Hurry
up!
Sarah,
come
on!
Sarah,
keep
hold
of
the
rope!


Oh,
ah.
-
Are
you
OK?
JUNO:
Is
everybody
OK?
Is
everybody
OK?
-
Don't
fucking
touch
me.
REBECCA:
I'm
here,
I'm
OK.
No,
I'm
fine.
-
Nobody
move
until
the
dust
has
settled.

HOLLY:You
might
be
right
about
that.
REBECCA:
Jesus.
HOLLY:
So
what's
the
story
now?
REBECCA:
According
to
the
guidebook,
This
is
just
one
of
them.
Juno,
that's
right,
isn't
it?
Check
the
book.
-
I
didn't
bring
it.
No
point.
For
Christ's
sake,
Juno.
I
knew
it.
I
knew
this
wasn't
right.
You
filed
a
flight
plan
to
mountain
rescue?
That's
how
it's
supposed
to
work
except
I
and
this
isn't
Boreham
We're
in
the
wrong
fucking
cave?
Holly
was
right.
-
Don't
try
and
pin
this
fucking
shite
on
me!
JUNO:
Rebecca,
This
is
exactly
what
we
believe
in.
We
said,
if
there's
no
Don't
try
and
justify
this.
Where...
Where
are
we?
It
hasn't
got
a
name.
It's
a
new
system.
I
wanted
us
all
to
discover
it.
No-one's
ever
been
down
here
before.
-
You're
fucking
kidding
me.
BETH:How
the
hell
do
we
get
out?
JUNO:Look,
there's
no
going
back
now.
We
have
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
BETH:What
the
fuck
do
We
all
trusted
you.
You
told
me
Have
you
any
idea
what
No,
cos
you
couldn't
get
away
JUNO:You
know
what,
Beth?
We
all
lost
something
in
that
crash.
Just
get
us
out
of
here.
JUNO:Look,
cave
systems
sometimes
But
if
we
stay
here,
we'll
die.
Let's
go.

JUNO:Wait!
Don't
move,
Sam.
Just
don't
move.
Stay
right
there.
Oh,
shit.
No
more.

Now
I
know
how
far
down
it
is.
So,
what
now?
One
of
us
has
to
get
all
the
way
across
there
I
have
three
cams,
I
need
at
least
three
more.
Where
is
it?
We
lost
it,
when
the
cave
collapsed.
Sorry.
Help
me.


Come
on,
Becca.

-
Aargh!
Come
on,
come
on.
JUNO:Come
on,
Rebecca.
Come
on,
Rebecca.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
-
Fuck.
What's
wrong?
It's
nothing.
I'm
all
right.
OK.



More
slack,
thanks.

Fuck!

Fuck,
fuck,
fuck.
-
OK.

OK.
OK.
OK.
Come
on.
Yeah!
-
Now,
you
make
it
look
easy.
-
Oh.
JUNO:Don't
look
down,
Beth.
-
Just
keep
going.
Good.
There
you
go.
Was
this
about
me
or
you?
It's
about
us,
I
wanted
us
to
claim
I
thought
maybe
your
name.
Or
maybe
yours.
REBECCA:
You're
doing
well.
Come
on.
Come
on.
There
you
are.


Juno?
We'll
need
everything
we've
got.
Haul
it
in.
Fuck.

Yes!

Reach.
Reach
out.
Aargh!
Juno!
No!

BETH:Juno,
it's
OK,
we've
got
you.
OK,
pull!

BETH:
Sam!
SAM:Rebecca,
show
me
your
hand.

Let
go,
let
go.
-
What
does
it
mean?
It's
a
piton,
right?
If
cavers
were
here,
there's
a
This
equipment
is
at
least
100
years
old.
Besides,
if
anyone
had
been
down
here
they
would
have
named
it
already.

JUNO:Becca,
are
you
OK?
I'll
live.
Holly,
how
does
it
look?
It's
tight
again,
but
OK,
keep
going.
HOLLY:
Hey,
there's
something
down
here.
Guys,
it's
amazing,
but
the
batteries
-
So
I
suggest
we
keep
moving.
-
What
is
it,
Beth?
-
We
don't
have
time
for
this.
-
Really
lovely,
Beth,
but
it's
fucking
useless.
You've
got
the
mountain,
the
cave...
and
there's
two
entrances.
-
You
are
a
fucking
genius.
-
This
means
there's
another
way
out?
Come
on!
-
Bastard!
Holly,
give
me
your
lighter.
-
Come
on.
Fuck!
-
Come
on!
Come
on!
-
That
one!
Holly,
slow
down!
JUNO:Holly!
Careful!
HOLLY:
Daylight!
I
can
see
daylight!
Holly!
Careful!
Slow
down!
Holly,
it's
not
daylight!
-
Help
me!
Guys!
Hold...
Holly!
Sam!
Get
down
here!
Holly!
Holly!
Holly!
Answer
me!
I
think
I
hurt
my
leg!
Don't
move!
We're
coming
down
to
you.
Oh,
fuck!

No!
Fuck!

Someone
better
get
down
here!
-
Oh,
that's
fucking
disgusting.
We
need
help.
Everybody
grab
a
corner.
Nice
and
easy
now.
And...
lift!
Argh!
-
You
fuckers!
-
It's
OK,
I've
got
her.
SAM:
You'll
be
all
right,
sweetheart.

OK.
-
Sarah!
-
Sarah!
Take
hold
of
her
arm.
What
are
you
gonna
do?
I
need
to
dress
the
wound
and
rig
up
a
splint,
I
need
to
push
it
back
in.
-
I
hate
you.
Do
it.
Bite
down
on
this.
-
Keep
hold
of
her.
-
Go!
Come
on!

Just
keep
biting
down,
baby.
Come
on.
OK,
someone
get
me
a
medical
kit.
OK,
OK,
OK.
Calm
down.


-

I
just
saw
something
Sarah,
I
promise
you,
But
I
can't
do
it
unless
you're
with
me.
Sarah?
Sarah!
Sarah,
look
at
me.
There's
nothing
there.
That's
the
best
I
can
do.
It'll
hurt
like
hell
and
you
can't
put
any
weight
They
combed
these
mountains
centuries
ago.
-
That
is
just
what
it
looked
like.
-
Sarah
thinks
she
saw
someone.
I
don'tthink
I
saw
No,
you
heard
something
-
It's
the
dark.
It
plays
tricks
on
people.
-
What
did
you
see?
REBECCA:Are
you
sure?
And
it's
not
the
first
time.
I
thought
Look,
if
there
is
somebody
down
here,
Sarah,
there's
no-one
down
here.
Hey,
we
have
to
get
Holly
out
of
here.
OK?
This
is
all
that
matters
right
now.
-
Beth!
Is
it?
Fuck!
Fuck
me.
SAM:You've
got
to
keep
warm.
BETH:
Why
are
we
walking
away?
JUNO:
It
wasn't.
We're
two
miles
underground,
HOLLY:

looked
Right
tunnel!

I
got
you.
OK?

BETH:
Jesus!
What
is
this
place?
Holly,
where's
the
infrared
button?
SARAH:Dead
animals.
Hundreds
of
them.
BETH:
This
is
not
good,
guys.
REBECCA:
Come
on.
-
I
don't
know.
There's
no
breeze.
It
could
be
any
one
Oh,
fuck
it!
Hello!
-
Please!
Hello!

JUNO:
It's
there!
It's
up
there!
Fucking
hell,
did
you
see...?
I
don't
know!
-
I've
never
seen
anyone
climb
like
that!
-
That
was
not
a
human
being!
Let's
take
our
chances

What's
happening?
Oh,
shit!
It's
circling
us.
-
Where
is
it?
Holly!
We've
got
to
move.
Come
on!
Move
it!
JUNO:Come
on,
Holly!
Move
it!
Let's
go!
-
Juno,
the
flare!
Get
rid
of
it!
JUNO:
Holly,
keep
moving,
come
on!
Holly!
Holly!
Sarah!
Holly!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Run!
Sarah!
Get
off!
Get
away,
you
fucker!




Don't
leave
me.
Oh,
fuck.
My
battery's
gone
dead.
Where
are
they?
What's
happened
to
the
others?
Becca,
please
say
we're
OK.
OK.
OK.
Go.
Go!
JESSICA:

If
you're
really
ready...




Oh,
fuck.
Fuck.
Turn
the
light
off.
Quiet.




JUNO:Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
It
can't
see
us.



Sam?
Becca?
Becca!

-Becca!
JUNO:Becca!
The
noise
she's
making,
she'll
bring
every
As
long
as
it's
not
on
mine.
Becca!
Sam!
JUNO:Sam!
Sam!
Anyone?
Sam!
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
Oh...
I'm
sorry.
Fuck.
OK.
OK.
OK.
It's
all
clear.

Sam,
run!

We
heard
you
crying
for
Sarah.
Where
are
the
others?
They...
They
took
Holly.
Beth...
Beth's
dead.

Sam...
...what
is
that
thing?
I
don't
know.
Well,
it
does
look
human.
Come
on,
we
need
to
find
the
way
out
No.
Sam,
tell
us
what
we're
fighting.
Well...
...they're
totally
blind.
And
judging
from
what
we've
seen,
I'd
say
And
they've
evolved
perfectly
Whatever
they
are,
And
they
bring
their
food
back
down
Listen,
if
we
can
stay
quiet
enough
...I
think
I
found
the
way
out.
You
think?
The
climbing
gear
we
found
-
whoever
-
I
found
those
markings.
Sarah.
I'm
not
leaving
without
Sarah.

Sarah!
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.
No.
Sarah...
I'm
getting
you
out
of
here.

Don't
touch
me.
Don't
touch
me.
I
heard
Juno
calling
me.
I'm
gonna
go
and
find
her,
and
we're
No,
stay
away
from
her.
-
What?
-
What?
No,
she
didn't.
No.
-
Shh.

Don't
trust
her.
You
find
your
own
way
out.
It's
OK.
It's
all
right.
I'm
not
gonna
leave
you,
Beth.
I'm
not
leaving
you
here,
OK?
Come
here.
Beth!
This
is
Juno's.
It's
from
Paul.
Oh,
no.
Sorry.


Please...
Oh,
that's
them.
Please.
Sarah...
...don't
leave
me
like
this.
No,
please
don't
ask
me
to
do
that.
-
Please.
I
can't
do
that.
Please.
OK.
Ssh.
Close
your
eyes.








Hurry!
