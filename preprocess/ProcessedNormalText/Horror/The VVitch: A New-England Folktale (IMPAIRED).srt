What
went
we
out
Leaving
our
country,
kindred...
...our
father's
houses?
We
travailed
a
vast
ocean...
For
what?
For
what?


Was
it
not
for
the
pure
-
and
the
Kingdom
of
God?
We
are
your
judges,

I
cannot
be
judged
for
I
have
done
nothing

the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
and
the


Then
shall
you
be
banished


Then
take
your
leave

How
sadly
hath
the
Lord
Katherine.
Thomasin.
Come.

In
secret
and
in
assembly
of
the
just...


I
here
confess
I've
been
idle
of
my
work,
neglectful
of
my
prayer.
I
have,
in
secret,
And
broken
every
one
of
thy
Followed
the
desires
of
mine
own
I
know
I
deserve
more
shame
...and
everlasting
hellfire.
But
I
beg
Thee...
forgive
me,
show
me
mercy,
show
me
Thy
light.

Thomasin.


Boo!

Where
is
Sam?
Where
is
that
little
man?
Boo!
There
you
are,
there
you
are.

Boo!
Sand-
Samuel!





Thomasin.

Sleep.
All
will
be
well,
sleep.




Caleb.
God
give
you
good
morrow.
All
are
still
a-bed.
Save
Mother.
Tis
no
ease
to
rise
on
a
gray
day.
The
Devil
holds
-
I'll
wake
em.
Thy
Mother's
not
slept
We
can
search
no
more,
Caleb.
If
not
a
wolf,
then
hunger
Let's
to
the
wood.
Been
a'layin
traps
even
before
this
new
misery.
Within
the
wood?
Will
thou
not
help
thy
father?
You
and
Mother
have
always
Caleb,
our
harvest
We
must
catch
our
food
We
will
conquer
this
wilderness.





Aye,
I
was
conceived
in
sin

Adam's
sin
imputed
to
me
and
a
corrupt

And
canst
thou
tell
me
My
corrupt
nature
is
empty
of
grace,
bent
unto
sin,
only
unto
sin

We
must
lay
it
again.
Was,
was
Samuel
born
a
sinner?
Aye.
Am
I
then--
We
pray
he
hath
entered
What
wickedness
hath
he
done?
Place
faith
in
God,
Caleb.
We'll
speak
no
more
on
thy
brother.
Why?
He
hath
disappeared,
Yet
you
and
Mother
He's
gone,
Caleb.
-
Tell
me!
-
Is
he
in
hell?
Mother
will
not
stop
her
prayer.
And
if
I
died,
if
I
died
this
day...
-
What
is
this?
-
Me
sins
are
not
pardoned!
And
if
God
will
not
-
Caleb!
Look
you,
but
'tis
God
alone,
not
man,
what
knows
who
is
the
son
who
is
good
and
who
is
evil.
Fain
would
I
tell
thee
that
thou
Wilt,
that
I
Will.
But
I
cannot
tell
thee
that.
Caleb?
Where
are
these
from?
From
Indian
Tom
and
old
Slater,
What
did
you
trade?
Thy
Mother's
silver
cup.

Speak
none
of
this
to
Mother.
None.
She's
overwrought
already.
I'll
tell
her
of
the
cup
Let's
not
speak
on
this
again.
Aye.

Fowler!
Fool
of
an
animal.
Fowler!

Fowler,
what's
this?

Praise
be
to
God.

Fie
upon't!
-
Father,
it
died.

And

What

the
matter
with
thee?
Take

They

Help

Jonas!

Father
said

Stop.
Each

Thomasin,

Get

As

We

In
the
valley.
I
thought
I

an
apple
tree
Father
brought
the
gun,
Why
did
you
not
tell
me?
Father
wanted
it
a
surprise,
but
there
were
none.
I
thought
I
seen
em.

I
like
you
not

Dost
hear
me?
Caleb,
be
a
good
lad
Stray
not
from
the
brook.
Why
are
you
dallying?
What
then?
What?
Caleb?
Caleb!
Stop
it.
I
meant
no
harm
in
it.
What's
the
matter
with
thee?
Come
hither.
What's
the
matter
with
thee,
eh?
Shh.
I've
seen
no
apples
I
would
thou
hadst
found
them.
I
so
wish
for
one.



Hear
that?
Aye.
Who's
there?

Mercy,
come
out.
I
be
not
Mercy,
I
be
the
Witch
of
the
Wood
Hear
me
stick
Clickety-clackity,
-
Mercy!
Why
is't
when
thou
dost
a
wrong,
I
be
a-washin
Father's
clothes
-
and
thou
art
playing
idle?
Spoilt
child.
I'll
tell
Mother
Black
Phillip
saith
Devil
take
your
Black
Phillip.
It's
your
fault
I
can't
leave
the
yard.
I
could
go
to
the
brook
-
Quiet,
thee.
A
witch.
I've
seen
her
in
her
-
Father
showed
me
the
tracks.
Aye,
it
was
a
witch,
-
Thomasin!
Liar.
Twas
I
what
stole
him,
-
Liar!
Liar!
List
not
to
her,
Mercy.
I
am
that
very
witch.
When
I
sleep,
my
spirit
slips
and
dances
naked
with
The
Devil.
-
That's
how
I
signed
his
book.
He
bade
me
bring
him
an
so
I
stole
Sam
And
I'll
make
any
man
-
No.
And
I'll
vanish
thee,
too,
-
Be
quiet!
Perchance
I
boil
and
bake
thee
-
No!
-
I'ts
not
true!
How
I
crave
to
sink
my
teeth

If
ever
thou
tellst
thy
Mother
of
this,
I'll
witch
thee
and
thy
Mother!
-
Caleb!
-
I
swear
it.
-
I
swear.
Get
away
from
her,
Caleb,
Why
tell
Mercy
-
Dost
thou
hate
me
now
too?
Leave
me
be.
Go
tell
Mother
-
Thomasin...
And
forgive
us
the
sins
we
have
free
us
from
the
shame
and
torment
We
beseech
thee,
increase
our
faith
our
fear
of
thy
name
that
we
may
be
assured
that
That
we
might
be
thy
children
but
as
we
hunger
so
our
souls
hunger
Finish
soon
our
days
of
sin,
through
the
purifying
our
Lord
and
only
Savior
-
Amen.
Thomasin,
what's
thou
done

Nay-
In
the
six
board,
then.
T'ain't
there
neither.
It's
been
disappeared
Didst
lose
it?
I've
not
touched
it.
Where
has
it
gone
then?


I've
caught
thee
She
says
she
haven't
touched
it,
How
thou
couldst
lose
my
father's
-
I
cannot
know.
Peace,
child.
It's
gone.
Did
a
wolf
vanish
that
too?
She
haven't
touched
it,
Katherine.
What
is
amiss
It
is
not
natural.
Caleb,
will
thou
read
out
We
must
find
some
light
Tomorrow
we
will
have
a
fast
day

Thomasin,
dist
not
bed

down
Baah,
baah.




Oh,
Holy
and
blessed
Spirit,
You
must
sleep
tonight,
Kate.
This
night
and
evermore,
amen.
Thou
dost
remember
I
love
thee?

I
do.
List
me,
Kate,
I
fear
thou
dost
look
We
must
turn
our
thoughts
He
hath
never
taken
a
child
from
us.
Who
might
earn
such
grace?
We
have
been

No.
He
hath
taken
us
and
to
show
us
more
of
His
grace.
Was
not
Christ
lead
into
the
wilderness
We
should
ne'er
have
left
Kate.
-
We
should
never
have
left!
-
There's
naught
hither!
How
dare
you
chide
me
on
a
cup?
Tis
not
for
vanity

Katherine,
I
must
tell
thee--
-
We
might
have
sold
it.
What
fool
would
trade
for
our
corn?

List
me,
our
daughter
hath
beget
Thomasin?
Caleb?
Are
you
abed?
Mercy?
Jonas?
She's
old
enough.

Twas
not
her
fault.

Aye,
it
was
thine


Our
children
are
being
fostered
up


How
oft
I
begged
and
begged

They'd
not
baptize




We
must
keep
him
still.




Peace,
peace.


I'll
to
the
village
The
Tildens
or
the
Whythings,
they
can
make
use
of
her.
They're
good
folk.
Stop,
Kate.
We
will
find
food,
I
know
it.

What
are
you
doing?
Go
to
sleep.
What
is
this?
-
Running
away
then?
-
Lie
not
to
me.
Then
what?
Tell
me!
If
thou
went
back
to
sleep
I
promise
thee,
you'll
need
not
leave
to
serve
I'll
be
back
by
mid-day.
-
Well,
let
me
along
with
ya.
-
Let
me
along.
If
you
don't
let
me
along
with
ya,
I'll
wake
Mother
Well?
Aye,
but
we
did!
-
Nay.
No.
We
had
glass
windows
in
England.
We
haven't
been
hither
As
you
like,
Thomasin?
You've
gone
mad.
Dost
not
remember
Fowler
-
You
must!
And
where
the
sun
would
shine,
Remember
once
he
lay
upon
the
table,
"We
will
have
him
for
meat!
Kate!
Kate!
You
must
remember
that!

I
remember
that
day,
Well...
it
was
pretty.

What
is't,
boy?

Burt,
calm
thee!
Fowler!
Nay,
Fowler!
Stand
here
with
Burt.
-
Caleb,
no.
He's
gone
mad!

-
Thomasin!
-
Thomasin!
-
Caleb!
-
Thomasin!

Thomasin!
-
Thomasin!

Thomasin!

Fowler!

O
God,
my
Lord,
I
now
begin,
For
I
repentant
now
shall
be,
None
ever
shall
destroy
my
faith,
O
God,
my
Lord,
I
now
begin,
For
I
repentant
now
shall
be,
None
ever
shall
destroy
my
faith,
nor
do
I
mind
what
Satan
saith.
O
God,
my
Lord,
I
now
begin,


Caleb!
Caleb!
-
Caleb!
Thomasin.
Oh,
my
girl,
my
girl.
Where
is
thy
brother?


What's
the
matter
with
thee,
Thomasin?
I'll
set
off
at
first
light.
T'would
be
better
to
go
to
the
village

There's
no
time
to
be
lost.
Likely
you
should
have
left
You
have
no
gun,
William,
-
Be
not
a
fool!
There
is
none
will
help
this
family.
Let
me
be!
The
moon
is
bright,
I'll
be
back
in
a
two-day,
-
Don't
go,
Father!
Tell
us
why
you
went
to
the
wood.
-
I
promised.
Let
me
find
favor
in
your
eyes.
Oh,
child,
tell
me
and
I
will!
I,
um...

I...
I
took
thy
father's
cup.
I
sold
it.
Forgive
me,
Kate.
What
is
this?
Katherine,
I
must
make
confession.
I
yestermorn
took
Caleb
Twas
for
food,
I
knew
you
were
false!
I
meant
it
as
a
surprise,
I
will
trap
that
wolf,
Kate.
You
stood
by
whilst
our
son
lied
to
me!
Twas
for
thy
sake!
-
You
took
him
to
the
woods!
You've
broken
God's
covenant.
And
you've
lost
another
child.
-
I
will
go
now.
I
Will
find
him!
And
kill
thyself
too?
Will
you
damn
all
your
family
to
death?!
-
Katherine!

Picking
apples.
Mother,
have
the
goats
-
Nay.
Let
it
wait
til
the
morrow.

Please
you,
Mother.
Come
hither,
child.
Hurry
back.



Caleb...

Father!
Caleb,
Caleb...
Shh.

both
the
Lord
and
giver
of
life.
Thy
sole,
Jesus
Christ,
Look
down
from
Heaven
upon
him
with
those
eyes
Pity
thy
wounded
servant...

Baa,
baa.
Baa,
baa,
baa.
What
ails
Caleb,
Black
Phillip?
Did
Thomasin
make
'im
sick
What
say
you?
Black
Phillip
says
you
are
wicked.
Aye,
he
told
me
too.
Damn
your
Black
Phillip.
He
says
you
put
the
Devil
I'd
never
hurt
Caleb,
-
You
beat
me.
-
You
said
you'd
eat
of
me.
Mother
and
Father
will
find
out.
-
What?

Thomasin!
Thomasin?



Dost
remember
John
Kempe's
son?
That
first
winter,
he
was
'Tis
not
the
same.
-
This
is
unnatural
providence.
Look
at
thy
son.
-
Will.
-
Think!
-
Think!
Does
this
not
look
What
witch?
Who
does
this
then?
Who?
Thy
thoughts
are
as
a
child.
What
are
you
doing?
We'll
back
to
the
plantation
Find
a
good
family
for
Thomasin,
He'll
tell
if
this
be
Yet
we
cannot
return
as
beggars.
I'll
scour
the
field.
There
must
be
I
beseech
thee,
Katherine,
How
might
we
all
bare
it
Well,
the
little
corn
and
the
goat
We'll...
We'll
back
with
Caleb
return
with
the
horse
-
You
cannot
leave
them
here!
Oh,
forget
the
crop,
Will!
What?!
What
dost
thou
want,
Katherine?
Tell
me
and
I
will
give
it
thee.
I
want
to
be
home.
Thou
shall
be
home,
In
England.

Oh,
Will...
I
also
have
a
confession
to
make.
I
never
meant
to
be
a
shrew
to
thee.

I
have
become
as
Job's
wife,

But
since
Sam,
since...
My
heart
has
turned
to
stone.

I
dreamed
once,
that
I
was
with
Christ
upon
Earth.
Oh,
I
was
so
very
near
Him.
And
in
many
tears
for
the
assurance
And
I
was
so
ravaged
I
thought
it
far
exceeding
And
since
Samuel
disappeared...
...I
have
such
a
sad
weakness
I
cannot
see
Christ's
help
as
near.
I
pray
and
I
pray,
but
I
cannot.
I
fear
I
cannot
ever
feel
Thou
shall
have
of
it
in
Heaven.
I'll
be
in
field.
If
you
can
spare
a
while,
do.
We'll
leave
at
dawn.
I
promise
thee
that.
Jonas,
Mercy,
come
hither!
Speak
not
a
word!

-
He
rules
the
land
with
mirth...
Please
you,
Mercy.
Black
Phillip
has
He'll
knock
thee
to
the
Earth
Sing
bah,
bah,
-
Sing
bah,
bah,
bah,
bah,
bah
Mercy.
Thomasin.

-
He'll
knock
thee
on
thy
back!

Come.
Get
the
broadaxe
Get
the
narrow
axe
Get
the
broadaxe
Get
the
narrow
axe

She's
upon
me!
She
kneels!
My
bowels!
My
stomach!
She
pinches!

Sin!
Sin!
Sin!!
Thomasin,
take
the
children
outside.
What
does
this
to
thee?
His
mouth
has
sealed
up.
Oh,
God,
William!
William!
Get
him
up!
Hold
him!
Children,
away
from
this!

You'll
break
his
jaws.

What
is...?



-
'Tis
she!
-
What
horrible
fancy
is
this?
Silence!
She
gave
him
to
the
Devil
-
They
lie!
She
turned
Flora's
milk
to
blood!
She
had
bade
us
-
It
was
but
a
jest
to
quiet
her,
I--
-
She
signed
his
book!
Don't
let
her
near
me!
-
They
conspire
against
me.
Nay,
I'll
not
hear
it.
I'll
have
proof,
or
Heaven
help
thee.
On
thy
knees!
Look
me
in
the
eye,
daughter.
-
Dost
thou
love
the
word
of
God?
Love
you
The
Bible?
Yes.
Yes!
We
are
children
of
sin
all,
yet
I
tell
thee,
I
have
raised
up
Let
us
pray,
We
shall
never
lie
open
Pray
for
thy
brother.
-
You
must
believe
us!
-
Thomasin!
Pray.

Our
Father,
which
art
in
Jonas,
pray.
I...
I
cannot
remember
my
prayer.
-
What?
What
nonsense
is
this?
Speak,
children.
Our
Father,
which
-


Pray,
you
beasts.
-
Get
on
thy
knees
and
pray!
-
Thomasin!
I
don't
hear
this.
This
is
not
so.


It's
her!
A
cat.
A
crow.
A
raven.
A
three-legged
dog.
A
wolf!

She
desires
of
my
blood.
-
Satan
upon
me!
[all
the
children
She
sends
'em
upon
me.
My
Lord,
my
Jesus!
-
Think
on
Christ!
I
am
thine
enemy,
wallowing
The
Lord
is
my
shepherd,
He
maketh
me
to
lie
and
leadeth
me
by
the
still
water...

I
am
thine
enemy...

I
am
thine
enemy,
wallowing

thy
brother,
Did

No.
You
