escaped

and...
So,
one
of

good

you
don't...
If
you
don't,
we're
going
to
come
in
And
on
you.
And
ah...
We
can
enter

we
want.
And
we
will

No,
nothing
is

Things
like

are
not
suppose

But
they
are
happening,

They're
happening
right
now.
Listen,
sit
down,
just
sit
down.
Okay,
sit
down,
sit
down,
listen.
To
answer
your
question,
Yes,
they
could
get
into
here.
OK,
they
could
tunnel
underneath
us.
They
could
smoke
us
out.
Improvise
a
battering
ram.
OK,
I'm
sorry,
but
it's
true.
So,
here's
what
we're
going
do.
We'll
gonna
give
them
We'll
find
that
man
And
we're
gonna
force
him
outside.
Now...
we
have
guns...
And
he
doesn't.
But
they'll
kill
him.
Why
should
he
die?
It's
either
him
or
us,
Charlie.

Not
killing
anyone
wouldn't
be
any
fun,
please!
Fuck!
Where
is
he?
There
he
is.
Look
at
me.
Come
on,
Where
are
you?
Come
on!

you
are.

Tell
me,
why
haven't
you
delivered
Are
you
protecting
him?
I
certainly
hope
not,
Mr.
Sandin.
No,
of
course
not.
I
just
can't
find
him.
You
see,
this
is
a
misunderstanding.

I
don't
condone
that
Just
keep
in

Mr.
Sandin...
he
was
my
friend,
and
you...
...are
not.
Our

is
arriving
soon.
And
we
will
get
him.
Soon
after
that...
we
will
need
him.

I'll
go
get
him.
Hey,
Charlie.
I
don't
know
what
going
on
here.
There
are
people
outside.
Henry
is
dead.
I'll
be
OK,
I
have
his
gun.
Stay
where
you
are.
Please
be
safe,
okay?
I'm
gonna
go
hide
No.
I
love
you.
Don't.
Zoey?
Get
back.
Into
the
hall.
Let's
go.
Drop
your
gun.
Dad,
please.
Drop
it.
Don't
hurt
her.

Zoey,
I
will
not
let
him
hurt
you.
Leave
her
alone.
No,
you
son-of-a-bitch.
I
will
let
her
go
You're
gonna
get
us
all
killed,
They're
going
to
come
in
here,
They
are
coming
here!
You
have
got
to
leave
my
family
If
you
don't
drop
your
gun,
-
and
I
will
hurt
you.
-
I
don't
deserve
