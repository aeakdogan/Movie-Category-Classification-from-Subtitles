---------------------------------------------------------------------
So
it's
6
PM
in
the
night
time...
...
which
is
when
I
wake
up.
This
is
always
really
scary
part
for
me.
Yes!
Night
time.
So,
now
I'm
going
to
wake
up
I
really
love
living
Wake
up!
Wake
up
everyone!
I
like
to
hang
out
with
other
vampires.
I
like
the
company.
Awaken!
A
wakey,
wakey!
I
just
really
like
having
a
good
time
Deacon...
Hi!
Hey!
Deacon...
How
was
your
night,
last
night?
I
transformed
into
a
dog
and
had
sex.
Cool!
We're
gonna
have
a
little
flat-meeting
-
Okay.
-
Should
I
close
this?
Vladislav?!
Sorry!
Sorry!
What?
-
Hey!
Umm,
we're
going
to
have
a
flat-meeting
20.
Okay...
is
it...
So
we're...
...in
Petyr's
room.
I'm
just
going
to
wake
him
up.
Petyr?
Petyr?!
Petyr,
wake
up.
Hey,
listen.
We're
just
having
a
You
don't
have
to
come
but
I
thought
I'd
extend
an
invitation
to
you
just
in
case.
Umm...
There's
a
lot
of
stuff
on
...
like
this
seems,
I
don't...
AH!
It's
a
spinal
column,
yuck!
And
I
was
thinking,
maybe...
...
I
just
should
bring
a
broom
if
you
wanted
to
sweep
up
I
don't
know.
You
know...
Okay.
I
got
you
this
chicken.
Is
Petyr
coming?
-
Should
we
be
worried?
...
8000
years
old.
We're
not
going
to
have
Okay,
so...
Wanted
to
have
a
quick
chat
uh...guys
I
think
that
we're
We're
not
just
pointing
You're
a
cool
guy
but
you're
Well,
I'm
glad
to
hear
that
I'm
cool.
-
No,
that's
not
the
point
though...
It's
not
a
flat
meeting
about
-
I
do
my
flat
chores.
-
Yes,
I
do
The
point
is
Deacon
that
you
Vladislav
is
right.
It's
unacceptable
to
have
so
many
bloody
I'm
so
embarrassed
Why
does
it
matter?!
You
bring
them
over
to
kill
them!
Vampires
don't
do
dishes.
Deacon's
like
the
rebellious
young
vampire.
He's
always
doing
crazy
things.
He's
just
like
the
young,
Okay,
so...
One
day
I
was...
...
selling
my
wears...
And
I
walked
passed
this
old
creepy
castle.
and
I
look
at
it
and
think...
...
'very
old
and
creepy.'
And
then
this
creature...
...
flies
at
me!
It
dragged
me
back
to
this
dark
dungeon.
And
bit
into
my
neck.
And
just
at
the
point
of
death...
...
this
creature...
...
forced
me
to
suck
its
foul
blood.
And
then...
...
it
opened
it's
wings,
like
this.
And
hovered
above
me.
Screeching.
'Now
you
are
vampire.'
And
it
was
Petyr.
And
we're
still
friends
today.
Vlad,
you
are
great.
Which
was
really
cool.
And!
The
other
day,
I
dragged
man's
and
noticed
that
there
was
no
dust.
Like,
I
kind
of...
Vladislav,
is
just
like...
...
this
older
vampire
who
grew
up
in
the
medieval
times.
And
you
know,
to
be
living
this
long
and
to
have
seen
the
things
that
he's
seen
and
still
like,
kind
of
have
it
together,
I
mean,
hat's
off
to
him.
Bloody
hell!
Sorry!
He's
a
really
great
guy.
A
bit
a
of
a
pervert.
He
has
some
pretty
old
ideas
about
things.
We
should
get
some
slaves!
When
I
first
became
a
vampire...
...
I
was
quite
tyrannical.
I
was
known
for
torturing
a
lot
of
people.
This
is
my
torture
chamber.
I
don't
come
in
here,
often
anymore.
I
tempted
to
torture
when
My
thing
was,
I
would
poke
someone
with
implements.
I
was
known
as
'Vladislav
the
poker'.
It's
been
like
this
the
whole
time...
-
Okay,
so...
...
pedantic.
The
washing
and
the
rubbish,
I
did
that.
Deacon,
on
dishes
and
He
was
an
18th
century
dandy.
So,
he
can
be
very
fussy.
He
nags
and
nags...
The
lunch
the
other
day
and
Which
one,
the
red
one?
Well,
it's
red
now,
yah.
If
you're
going
to
eat
a
victim
put
down
some
newspaper
on
the
floor
and
some
towels.
We're
vampires!
Some
vampires
do.
Well,
not
serious
ones!
When
you
get
4
vampires
in
a
flat
obviously
there's
going
to
be
There's
tension
in
any,
It's
settled
then.
We
all
do
our
jobs,
I
will
do
my
dishes!
This
is
bullshit.
Well,
I
became
a
vampire
when
I
was
16.
That
is
why
I
always
look
16.
In
those
days,
of
course,
Vampires
have
had
a
pretty
bad
rec.
We're
not
these
mopey
And
while
some,
most
of
us
are,
There
are
also,
those
of
us,
really
small
countries
like
New
Zealand.
I
was
a
Nazi
vampire.
After
the
war,
which
the
Nazi's
lost...
I
don't
know,
...
that
war.
If
you
were
a
Nazi,
after
the
war...
...and
if
you
were
a
vampire...
...
and
if
you
were
a
Nazi
vampire...
No
way.
I
was
out
of
there.
Yah,
I
came
to
this
country
for
love.
Uh,
there
was
a
girl.
Human
girl.
And...
...
I...
...
thought
she
was
fantastic.
...
absolutely
amazing.
I
was
smitten.
Her
family
emigrated
to
New
Zealand.
And,
I
thought,
'you
know
what,
to
hell
with
it.
I'm
gonna
go.
I'm
going
to
chase
her
I
told
my
servant
Phillip,
'Send
me
to
New
Zealand.'
He...
...
put
the
wrong
postage
on
my
coffin.
So
the
whole
journey
took
about
18
months.
And
when
I
got
here,
she
had...
...
found
someone
else.
She
had
fallen
in
love.
And...
She
was
married.
She
gave
me
this
before
she
left.
There
she
is.
That's
me,
I
put
myself
in
there
too.
She
told
me
in
was
pure
silver.
Unfortunately...
...
we
vampires
can
not
wear
silver.
Yeah...
It's
about
as
long
as
I
can
wear
that.
Tonight,
we
are
going
out
It
is
important
that
we
look
good.
Yeah,
it's
really
good.
Yeah.
One
of
the
unfortunate
things
about
...
don't
know
exactly
what
you
look
like.
Look!
A
ghost
cup!
Floating
all
by
itself!
We
can
give
each
other
feedback
and
help
each
other
out
until
Yes,
some
of
our
clothes
are
from
victims.
We
might
bite
someone
and
then...
...
you
think,
-
Do
work
these?
Change
it!
When
you
are
a
vampire,
We
are
trying
to
attract
victims
to
us.
Not
sure
about
the
waist
coat.
I
go
for
a
look
which
I
call
We
are
the
bait.
But
we're
also
the
trap.
Hello,
ladies.
And
my
love,
we
are
ready
to
go
Vampire...
vampire
style.
When
we
go
into
town,
We
are
walking
the
streets.
Coming
into
town.
just
for
one
brief
moment
I
feel...
Homos!
The
trouble
with
being
a
vampire
is
you
have
to
be
invited
in,
to
go
in.
We
would
like
to
come
into
the
bar,
please.
Invite
us
into
the
bar,
please.
Keep
walking.
You
invite
us
in!
If
the
humans
find
out
what
we
were...
...
they
would
destroy
us.
There
are
between
60
and
70
vampires
-
Obvious
vampire.
Hello!
How
embarrassing.
He's
a
guy
I
used
to
work
with
-
Is
he
gone?
I've
been
draining
him
all
night.
Been
a
very
thirsty
girl.
Being
bitten
as
a
little
boy
you
always
going
to
look
the
same
age.
What
are
you
doing
tonight?
Going
to
kill
some
perverts?
-
Yeah,
we're
meeting
a
pedophile.
Okay,
let's
just
go
please.
-
Have
a
good
night,
guys!
The
Big
Kumara
is
vampire
and
so
we
could
always
get
in.
It's
the
hottest
night
spot
-
Come
on
in,
guys,
come
on
in.
Perhaps
you
could
bring
-
Sure.
Virgins?
Yep,
okay.
Any
kind
of
preference
Maybe
some
ladies?
Yep.
Ladies.
Perhaps
a
guy?
One
of
each?
One
of
each
should
be
cool.
My
relationship
with
Deacon
is...
...
well,
I'm
his
familiar.
He
tells
me
what
to
do,
I
do
it.
We
have
the
kind
of
master-servant
Actually.
-
Hello!
Oh,
it's
a
little
bit
of
blood.
Um,
my
husband,
he's
a,
You
know,
someone
who
bleeds
a
lot.
Yeah.
Any
kind
of
age
range?
-
Young.
Not
kids.
18
to
30?
Definitely
younger
than
yourself.
Okay,
so
18
to
30.
So
it's
a
dinner
party?
-
I'll
be
there?
-
Dinner
party.
Yes.
-
We
will
all
be
there?
-
Okay,
great.
-
Should
be
fun.
I
was
just
wondering
You
don't
know
of
a
night
dentist?
Because
I
have
this
thing
here.
I
was
just
wondering
if
-
Hm?
-
The
dishes?
The
deal
is
that
he
is
going
Um,
which
is...
...
very
exciting.
Well,
I
just
feel
like
I
kind
of
I
wouldn't
want
to
kind
of,
I
just
feel
like
I'm
the
best
version
It's
just
that
it's
been
I
just
want...
doing
your
plans
and...
Doing
your
dry-cleaning.
Yeah...
the
dentist?
And
the
dentist
and
it's
just
taking
an
-
Be
gone!
-
I
see
you
later!
One
of
the
most
unfortunate
things
...
you
have
to
drink
human
blood.
I
like
to
make
a
real
evening
of
it.
Play
some
music.
Maybe
give
them
some
nice
wine.
It's
their
last
moment
alive
so
So...
Tell
we
what
you
do,
what
do
you...
I
was
thinking
about
Oh,
you
are?
there.
University,
yeah?
Yeah,
but
after
that,
Yeah...
I
really
wanted
Saving
out
and
I'm
gonna
go
to
Spain
and
Italy
and
London
and...
Yeah.
Okay.
Excuse
me.
Just
put
that
there.
There
we
go.
Shit!
Well,
that
didn't
go
so
great.
Um,
I
hit
the
main
artery.
So,
yeah,
it's
a
real
mess
in
there,
um...
On
the
upside,
So,
it's
quite
late
and
uh...
I've
managed
to
find
a
woman
up,
And,
uh,
she
seems
like
I'm
just
going
to
use
hypnosis
on
her...
See
me...
See
me...
She
can't,
she
can't
see
me
Vladislav
used
to
be
extremely
powerful.
He
could
hypnotize
crowds
of
people.
Great
orgies.
20-30
women.
He
could
turn
into
all
sorts
of
animals.
But
now
he
never
get
the
faces
right.
He
would
kill
anybody.
Children.
Burning...
everything.
It
was
totally
great.
But
he
suffered
a
humiliating
defeat...
...
at
the
hands
of
his
arch
nemesis...
...
The
Beast.
And,
he's
never
been
the
same.
See
me...
See
me...
See
me...
See
me...
Would
you
like
to
come
inside?
Ah!
-
Jackie,
welcome!
Come
in.
This
is
Nick.
Ex-ex
boyfriend.
-
And
Josefine.
And
this
is
Deacon,
Deacon
and
his
friends
need...
...
victims.
Hi!
Please
come
in,
welcome.
There
can't
be
people
that...
...
I
actually
envious
them
or
like
because
of
course
Hi!
Josefine?
No,
I
sat
next
to
you
in
English.
Um,
you
used
to
call
me
the
Jacksersist?
No
you
did,
no
you
did.
Yeah.
No,
you
started
that.
You
were
the
one
who
started
calling
me
that
Yeah.
Okay,
bye
then.
Bye.
She's
in.
You
like
that,
Nick?
Yep,
it's
nice.
I
will
go
and
prepare
dinner.
Nick,
are
you
a
virgin
at
all?
Um,
what?
Doesn't
seem
like...
are,
are
you
a
virgin?
-
Yes.
You
were
a
virgin
when
Yeah,
I
was
12.
You
said
he
was
a
virgin.
I
think
we
drink
virgin
blood
because...
...
it
sounds
cool.
I
think
of
it
like
this...
If
you're
going
to
eat
a
sandwich..
You
will
just
enjoy
it
more
if
Let's
concentrate
on
Josefine
than.
Are
you
a
virgin?
I'm
not,
no.
Okay,
I'm
really
sorry.
Because
I
totally...
Him
there
is
a
Virgin.
She
looks
like
a
virgin.
Who
would
have
sex
with
her,
I
wouldn't.
I
would.
Oh.
Okay,
good.
-
It's
2
dinners...
yum.
Do
you
like
bisghetti?
Uh...
yep.
But,
be
better
if
it
was
warm?
So,
this
is
my
favorite
trick.
We
present
our
guest
And
then,
I
would
say,
Please,
Nick.
Eat
some
bisghetti.
I
didn't
realize
you
enjoy
eating
worms.
Nick.
-
No...
There's
worms
moving
around
on
my
plate.
Worm
like
but
not
actually...
Worm
like
but
not
actually...
We
stole
that
idea
from
The
Lost
Boys.
But
I
put
a
nice
twist
on
it.
Nick.
How
does
it
feel
to
Jackie?
My
penis
has
disappeared.
Nobody
is
gonna
mistake
-
Believe
me.
No,
it
is
just
a
normal
penis.
I'm
out.
I'm
out.
Josefine?
Do
you
like
bisghetti?
Look,
these
freaks...
...
spike
my
bisghetti,
Not
cool.
You
don't
think
this
is
weird?
For
fuck
sakes...
Jackie?!
Jackie!
-
Sorry
Nick.
Jackie!
Shit!
Fuck
off.
Where
am
I?
Fuck.
Fuck!
Freaks!
Ah,
no...
Petyr
got
him.
Poor
guy...
Who
let
Petyr
out?
Hey,
guys!
Hey,
what
are
you
guys
doing?
What
are
you
doing,
Nick?
Come
into
the
house.
-
Hi,
my
name
is
Nick.
I've
been
a
vampire
for
2
months.
Probably,
I
reckon
best
thing
Like
I've
always
wanted
to,
And
now
I
can
do
it.
Oh...
Nick,
why
don't
you
use
the
front
door?
Why
would
I?
I'm
flying.
Petyr
bit
me.
Sucked
all
my
blood
out.
I
woke
up
in
his
basement
and...
...
he
offered
me
some
blood.
I
just
thought
it
was
something...
...
some
German
thing
that
these
guys
do.
This
transition,
into
becoming
I
look
like
shit
to
start
off
with,
like,
Like
you
could
see
the
inside
of
my
neck.
I
had
blood
all
over
my
top.
And
then
I
came
home
and
I
was
either
really
hot
or
really
cold.
It
was
like
a
hang-over
times
10,
I
reckon.
It
was
really
bad.
It
was
quite
similar
to
having
the
flu.
Except,
the
only
difference
...
that
my
eyes
bleed
heaps.
Are
you
guys
not
cold?
No,
I
can't
really
explain
it.
...
bloody
eyes
and
flying
and
stuff.
The
neighbors
can
see
you
You
want
to
draw
attention
You
got
a
whole...
I
am
doing
an
erotic
dance
for
my
friends.
And
you
ruined
it.
My
friends
are
loving
it.
I
love
it.
I
saw
the
end
of
it.
I
don't,
I
don't
know,
But...
I
don't
know.
I
don't
know
the
oldest
stuff,
...
when
it
comes
to
the
real
world.
So...
I
don't
know,
Hang
out
with
them.
But
I
could
probably
At
the
start
it
was
like,
'...
I'm
dead.'
It
kind
of
affected
my
friendship
with
But,
of
the
way
I
see
it,
They
accept
me
for
who
I
am.
Even
though...
...
one
of
them
killed
me.
Where
should
we
go
tonight?
Let's
go
to
the
big
Kumara.
Why
don't
we
go
to
Boogie
Wonderland?
My
friend
Richard's
the
bouncer.
-
What?
Really?
-
Stu
is
game.
Ah,
this
is
my
friend
Stu.
-
Hey.
Originally
he
went
out
with
my
sister.
And
then
they
broke
up.
I
didn't
want
her
to
do
it,
but...
It's
got
nothing
to
do
with
me.
And
um...
he
can't
hear
me.
Yeah,
so
basically...
Stu
doesn't
know
that
I'm
a
vampire.
And
he
doesn't
know
that
He
just
thinks
that
I'm
just...
...
with
some
powerful
friends.
I
bought
a
room
in
the
house
and
Just
like...
...
it
really,
really
sucks...
...
that
I
can't
eat
him.
I
just
want
to
like...
Look
at
it.
Right,
you
can
hear
me.
-
Like
computer
based
and
stuff,
heh,
mainly?
-
Databases.
Let's
have
a
vote
for
Boogie
Wonderland
Big
Kumara!
Wait.
Come
on
Stu,
hurry
up.
I
don't
think
Nick
should
have
been
He's
such
a
dick.
Looking
great
man!
You
are
most
welcome!
We're
in
Boogie
Wonderland!
Here
we
are
at
Boogie
Wonderland
This
is
amazing!
I'm
so
happy
to
be
here.
This
is
pretty
cheesy.
Also,
did
you
see
the
jacket
he
wore?
He's
wearing
the
same
jacket
as
me.
-
It's
not
exactly
the
same.
I'm
just
loving
being
a
vampire.
Over
there,
is
the
big
Fat
Lady's
Arms.
Ah,
on
Wednesday's
there
be,
You
can
win
like
t-shirts
and
I
can
smell
werewolves.
Okay,
we're
just
about
to
walk
passed
Look
out
guys.
Don't
catch
flees.
-
What's
that,
mate?
-
Sorry
what?
-
Keep
walking!
-
Have
you?
What
are
you
filming?
We
don't
want
any
trouble.
-
Why
did
you
start
it?
Huh?
Why
don't
you
girls
smell
-
Come
on.
It's
not
worth
it.
We
don't
smell
our
own
crutches.
And
it's
a...
form
of...
greeting.
Your
own
camera,
mate,
don't,
don't...
What?
It's
okay,
cause
I
know
this
guy.
It's
count
Fagula.
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Don't
swear.
-
Sorry...
they...
they...
-
Not
swearwolves.
We're
werewolves,
not
swearwolves.
-
No,
listen,
that's
offensive...
Well,
at
least
you're
talking
Please,
this
bundle
of
sticks...
Werewolves?
-
No,
no,
no!
He's
just
gonna
take
of
his
gloves.
Ah,
shit,
man!
Hey!
Don't
swear.
-
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Calm
down.
Calm
down!
-
Get
the
fuck
my
glasses!
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey!
Do
the
breathing!
Do
the
breathing.
Do
the
breathing.
-
Come
on.
Count
to
10,
human
again.
-
10,
human
again.
Thanks
a
lot
guys.
-
Enjoy
your
night,
yah?
Great,
we
didn't
want
this
to
happen.
-
Come
on
guys.
Say
it!
Don't
spray
it,
bitch!
Declan!
-
Why
are
you
swearing
all
the
time?!
-
Were
they
actually
werewolves?
Are
you
okay,
Stu?
I
just
don't
really
know
how
to...
...
approach
this,
Um,
and
he
is
a
good
friend.
And
I
don't
wanna...
...
I
don't
want
to
break
...
then
again,
what
do
you
do
when
I'm
expecting
him
to
be
angry.
He
might
be
scared
and
expecting
You
probably
noticed,
it
has
been...
...
I've
been
going
through
-
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like...
I
don't
show
up
for
lunch
anymore.
-
Yeah.
...
changed
the
story
of
The
night
time,
Tina's
games.
Right...
And
how
you
went
from
beating
me
every
time
and
how
I
I've
won
the
last
3?
Yeah.
So...
The
reason
I
brought
you
here...
...
is
to
tell
you
that...
...
I'm
a
vampire.
Stu
took
it
pretty
well.
He's
definitely
my
best
mate.
And
I'm
not
gonna
eat
him.
But
if
they
ever
offer
you
bisghetti...
Um...
you
shouldn't
eat
it.
They
offered
me
biscotti.
Vampire
mates
don't
eat
human
mates.
And
no
matter
how
much
I
want
to
eat
him...
...
I
will
never
eat
him
cause
he's
my
mate.
-
Right,
Stu?
Yeah.
Stu
is
great.
We
really
like
him.
At
first
I
wanted
to
kill
him.
But
now
I'm
glad
I've
spent
Yeah,
of
course
he
looks
delicious
But
we've
all
got
an
agreement
-
Right?
The
guys
upstairs,
they...
That's...
it
started
off
with,
'Who's
this
human
you're
But
it
took
them
literally
2
minutes
and
they
like
him
more
than
I'm
knitting
a
scarf
for
Stu.
Try
it
again.
Use
your
legs.
Wow.
-
Step
back...
-
Yep.
Yep.
I'm
just,
what
I'm
trying
to
say
is...
...
cause
I
know
that
you...
...
you
turned
me
into
a
vampire.
Maybe
don't
do
that
to
him.
He's
a...
vegetarian.
Last
thing
he'd
want
to
is
eat...
...
a
life-being
or
eat
blood
or
eat
meat...
-
I
am
controlling
this.
Quite
amazing
to
see
how
far
if
you're
not
paying
attention.
One
message
received.
There
is
a
crucifix
behind
you.
So,
done
on
it,
or
like,
Maybe
smile.
-
Anything
you
want
to
find,
you...
-
You
can
type
your
name
here.
...
a
really
nice
silk
scarf
in
about
1912.
Yes,
now
Google
it.
Stu
is
the
first
human
friend
With
humans
there's
a
tendency
to
die.
Yeah.
We
can
look
at
her
photos.
-
Ah,
oh
yes.
Yes.
Can
we
see
a
movie
with
sunrise?
-
What?
Shit!
Nice...
If
you
push
images,
-
Ah,
yes.
Yes.
I
don't
think
she's
a
virgin
There
he
is,
yeah.
This
is
my
old
servant,
Phillip.
-
So,
we're
gonna
call
him.
And...
...screen...
My
God,
that's
him,
that's
him,
He
looks
old.
Yeah,
kind
of
like
youth
romance,
Maybe
Twilight,
have
you
seen
it?
Okay,
I'm
the
main
guy
in
Twilight.
Twilight?
That's
me.
Cameras
following
me
around.
They
could
have
chosen
anyone.
How
many
people
have
you
told
-
Not
many.
...
talking
about
that
Yeah,
I
told
her.
-
Who
else?
Uh,
I
told
her
hot
friend.
You
can't
tell
everyone
Who's
that
guy?
I
don't
know
but
I
told
him.
You
can't
tell
everyone.
Yeah,
I've
got
a
bit
of
an
eye
condition.
What's
wrong
with
him?
Um,
vampire
eyes.
Oh,
my
God,
is
that
your
fangs?
For
real?
For
real,
real.
For
real,
real.
I'm
a
vampire.
-
What?
-
I'm
a
vampire
hunter.
-
No?
I'll
Skype
you!
I
float.
-
I
transform
into
stuff.
-
No
you
can't.
I'll
show
you.
Show
me.
What
have
I
got?
Don't
lie
about
transforming
into
shit.
-
Twilight!
You're
not
Twilight.
-
What's
your
problem?
Telling
the
world
that
we
are
vampires.
And
I'll
tell
the
whole
world
Shut
up!
-
Shut
up!
-
You
shut
up!
-
No,
you
shut
up.
I'm
Dracula,
man!
You're
not
Dracula!
You
don't
even
know
who
Dracula
is!
You
idiot!
-
Oh,
bat
fight!
Ah,
Deacon!
That
wasn't
fair,
man!
My
fucking
jacket,
man!
I
don't
care
about
your
stupid
jacket.
-
Deacon!
-
Hey,
Stu?
How's
your
worms?
Alright.
You're
eating
worms.
Can
you
do
that
shit
when
No.
Doesn't
work
on
chips.
Only
works
on
things
that
-
Maybe
noodles.
Do
you
want
some
noodles?
Oh
no.
I
wouldn't
eat
that.
Why?
Are
you
okay
Nick?
Alright?
He
ate
fried
chip.
I
can't
eat
salads
now,
great.
I
can't
sunbath.
I
can't
watch
daytime
TV.
I
can
if
I
could,
or
I
guess
I
could.
More,
more
then
ever
just
the
chips.
My
favorite
food.
I
don't...
it's
just...
I
hate...
I
said
it.
I'm
over
being
a
vampire.
So,
don't,
don't
believe
the
hype.
Jackie?!
Jackie,
can
I
come
in
please?
-
Okay,
off
to
bed,
guys!
-
Don't
look
at
the
men.
Don't
look
at
the
men!
I
was
going
to
bite
you
tonight.
Really?
But
now
I
can't
because
Sorry,
sorry,
I
thought
you
No,
I
didn't...no...
he's
a
vampire.
What
do
you
mean?
He
jumped
in
front
of
your
place.
All
I'm
saying
is
that,
um...
You
know
if
I
had
a
penis,
I
would
have
been
bitten
years
ago.
I
might
have
to
penalize
you.
Perhaps
another
couple
of
years.
Hm?
Like
one
big
circle,
You
know,
they
don't
even
wear
shirts,
...
a
big
homo-erotic
dick
biting
club.
And
I'm
stuck
here,
Also
clean
the
bathroom,
please.
It's
blood
everywhere.
Okay,
see
you
tomorrow.
Off
to
bed,
please.
Katherine.
She
was
so
charming
and
nice.
She
was
everything
I
wanted.
Unfortunately...
...
yeah,
she
was
married.
Sure,
I
wanted
to
kill
the
guy.
I
thought
about,
chopping
his
head
off.
Draining
him
of
every
Who
wouldn't?
But
then,
I
also
saw
And
that
made
me
kind
of
happy.
And
I
didn't
want
to
ruin
it
for
her,
so...
I
did
the
honorable
thing
and
I
just...
...
stepped
back.
And
let
her
live
her
life.
Petyr!
Petyr!
Where
is
it?
Petyr!
Petyr!
Petyr!
Get
water!
-
Get
out
of
the
sunlight!
Get
water!
Petyr,
Get
in
the
shadows,
Petyr!
Get
out
of
the
sunlight!
Get
out
of
my
way!
I'm
going
in!
I'm
coming
Petyr!
-
Deacon,
no,
it's
sunlight!
It's
sunlight
out
there!
It's
sunlight!
I
was
too
late.
Turn
that
thing
off.
Our
friend
had
just
been
killed
So
this
is
what
I
think
happened.
The
vampire
hunter...
...
broke
into
the
window
here.
Has
impacted
the
table.
Then
he
has
come
this
way.
Towards
the
tomb.
Crucifix!
Cover
the
crucifix!
And
then...
...
Petyr
has
burst
from
the
tomb.
Pushed
the
tomb
lid
And
then
the
sunlight
has
come
through
here.
And
burned
Petyr
alive.
Think
this
is
just
a
table
leg,
which
is...
...
sanded
down.
-
Do
you
think
he
hand
sanded
that,
or?
Image
that,
stuck
in
your...
It's
quite
shocking
down
here,
Nick.
Look,
here's
our
sweet
Petyr.
-
Fucking
hell.
-
I
can't
figure
out
this.
Is
this
Franco?
-
Uh,
who's
this
guy?
...
bloody
head,
back
to
front.
Twist
it
the
other
way,
Let's
see
who
this
guy
is.
-
Hm,
typical
macho
type.
It
is.
Oh,
shit!
I
know
that
guy.
-
Actually.
-
Yeah.
I
saw
him
the
other
night
in
town.
Told
him
I
was
a
vampire.
What?!
I
thought
he
was
joking.
You
let
a
vampire
hunter
into
our
house?
-
I
just
gave
him
my
e-mail.
Take
out
your
tongue.
And
shove
it
down
your
ass.
Fucking
hell!
You
and
your
big
mouth!
It
was
a
mistake!
Get
up
and
stand
on
this
ceiling
like
a
man.
We
can
talk
it
out,
yeah,
man?
We
can
talk
it
out,
mate!
-
I'll
kill
you!
Stu,
stay
back!
Someone's
at
the
door.
Go,
go.
Oh,
shit.
-
Good
evening,
sir.
Hi,
I'm
constable
O'Leary.
We're
just
responding
to
a
report
...
a
rather
large
amount
of
shrieking.
Just,
um,
wondering
maybe
we
could
come
in
Okay.
What's
with
the
fellow?
Yeah,
we're
obviously
just
here
from
the,
a
member
of
the
public,
um,
Um,
some
loud
noises.
-
Possibly
a
forced
entry,
wasn't
there?
And,
also,
maybe
a
bit
We're
just
checking
over
the
scene.
You
know,
above
board
Making
sure
no
ones
in
danger,
We
might
go
up
and
have
a
wee
look
up
there,
-
Come
on
mate,
you
lead
the
way.
Okay.
-
Smells
a
bit
weird
here
too,
mate.
What
do
you
call
that?
Barbecue.
You
will
not
notice
anything
No,
we
certainly
hope
not.
Lets
just
keep
going.
-
Hi
there
guys.
How
are
yah?
Hi
fellas.
We've
just
wondering
where
That
was
me.
Yeah,
okay,
we've
had
A
couple
of
people
not
happy
Okay.
The
neighbors?
You
got
neighbors
on
either
side.
Feeling
nervous.
I've
hypnotized
those
cops.
I'm
not
a
great
hypothesizer
I
really
hope
that
those
guys
because
then
this
means
Possibly
even
Christians
which
is
totally
I
can
see
you're
having
a
good
time.
...
we
got
to
keep
the,
uh,
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa...
See
what
I'm
seeing?
Is
that
even
ok?
You're
joking?
Not
a
smoke
alarm
in
sight.
No
smoke
detectors,
mate?
Rule
number
1:
Smoke
detectors.
Okay.
Rule
number
2:
maybe
not
-
Sorry
fellas.
-
Barbeque's?
What
kind
of
marinade?
Who's
this
guy?
Um...
It's
a
friend
who
came
to
our
party.
Mate,
you're
alright?
-
He's
drunk.
Drunk
guy.
You
can't
just
leave
him
down
This
guy's
not
having
a
good
time.
He's
gonna
feel
terrible
tomorrow
morning.
Well,
he's
soul
is
in
hell,
so...
Well,
I
don't
know
where's
his
soul's
at,
Who
left
the
concrete
on?
-
Yeah,
you
can
move
him
there?
-
Seen
anything
else
in
there?
-
Okay.
What
have
we
got
here?
-
What
is
that?
-
Oh,
this?
Adhesive,
mate.
That's
a
flammable.
And
then
you
got
a
lamp
on
top
of
that.
Directly
underneath
the
power
source.
-
That
is
quite
bad.
And
no
smoke
detectors
again
are
there?
-
No.
-
Yes,
there
are.
Lots
to
think
about
guys.
-
Yeah,
lots
to
think
about
there
guys.
Yeah,
good
thinking,
-
...
have
a
bit
of
dialogue
about
it.
-
They've
got
a
really
good
point.
Let's
kill
them.
Well,
let's
just
see
what
other
safety...
-
Stay
here
and
then
maybe
we'll...
I
call
into
session,
this
trial
of
Nick,
of
Wellington.
Read
the
charges.
Problems
we
have
with
Nick.
Number
1:
You
brought
a
human
into
our
house.
-
Which
is
a
big
no-no
in
the
vampire
world.
Yeah,
Stu
is
fine,
so
I
guess
we'll
just...
...
cross
that
one
out.
Uh...
-
Thank
you
Stu.
So...
The
new
number
1:
Nick's
been
telling
people
he's
a
vampire.
That
in
turn
resulted
in...
...
an
unwanted
visit
from
a
vampire
hunter.
Crime
number
2:
This
is
quite
a
bigy,
Nick.
The
vampire
hunter
who
killed
Petyr.
That's...
I
actually
should've...
but
we
wanted
to
build
up
to
that.
Number
3:
Deacon
doesn't
like
that
And
he
would
like
you
to
find
For
these
crimes
of
which
we
the
vampire
council
find
you
guilty...
...
you
should
be
banished
from
our
flat.
Indefinitely.
-
Indefinitely?
So
I
can
come
back?
No,
no,
indefinitely
means
I
thought
that
there
was
no...
No,
indefinite
means
Yeah,
but
it's
long.
Could
be
tomorrow,
it
could
be
6
months.
NO!
No,
it
is
not
tomorrow!
-
You
get
about
at
least
6
moths.
You
are
banished.
But
Stu,
you
can
visit
if
you
like.
Thank
you.
For
your
crimes...
...
you
will
be
made
to
suffer...
...
the
procession...
...
of
shame.
I
asked
them
Nick,
We
should
do
this
immediately.
-
In
my
opinion.
You
didn't
ask.
You
were
saying
yes.
-
I
did...
I
still
think
it's
quite
extreme.
Let
us
do
the
procession
of
shame.
Now.
-
Shame.
Shame.
Shame.
Shame!
Shame!
-
Shame.
Shame.
Should
we
go
Stu?
Bye
Stu.
That
was
a
shame.
So
today
we
have
an
invitation.
To
the
big
event
of
the
year.
Breaking
it
open.
They
have
burned
the
edges.
-
Like
a
treasure
map
or
something.
'Dearly
departed...'
That's
us.
'The
Wellington
vampire
association
lower-hat-vampire-witch
club
and
the
Kurory-zombie
society
invite
you
to
attend
The
Unholy
Masquerade
...
starting
at
6
PM.'
-
666...
The
Unholy
Masquerade,
of
course,
is
great
There's
zombies
there.
Vampires,
banshees,
It's
all
a
big
deal
for
me.
Love
it.
One
year
I
went
to
Whoopi
Goldberg
from
Sister
Act...
...
1
and
Sister
Act
2:
Back
in
the
Habit.
Didn't
go
down
so
well
because
Vampires
don't
like
nuns.
Of
course
the
big
deal
of
is
that
every
year
they
And...um...
I
don't
know
if
I
heard
a
little
rumor
that
the
guest
of
honor
this
year...
...
might
be
me.
The
location...
-
Oh,
yeah,
where
is
it?
Detrol
of
Despair.
And
the
guest
of
honor
will
be...
Who
is
it?
Show
me.
Hm.
Okay.
Okay.
-
Okay.
Okay,
that's
fine.
That's
fine.
Vladislav...
...
has...
...
just
had
a
reaction
to
the
information
...
um...
The
Beast.
The
darkest
part
of
my
mind
is
reserved
to
The
Beast.
We
can
tell
you
a
thing
You
should
pray
that
you
This
one
is
called
The
Beast.
And
I
said,
He
may
have
told
you
great
battle
with
The
Beast.
Yeah,
oh,
Oh...
'I
fought
The
Beast
in
a
swamp.'
'One
time
I
fought
The
Beast
Difficult
battle.
I
hope
you
never
see
The
Beast.
The
Beast.
You
can't
go
the
the
ball
as
Blade.
He's
a
vampire
hunter.
Yeah,
but
vampires
love
Wesley
Snipes.
It's
inappropriate.
Okay,
Vlad?
The
Green
Jortes,
or
the
Black
Leather
with
the
Dragon
Belt?
-
We're
have
a
mild
crises
here.
-
What
do
you
want
with
me?
Look
at
the
pants!
Enough
with
the
pants!
-
Shit,
man!
Oh,
you
look
terrible.
The
black
pants.
Thank
you.
Get
dressed!
I
don't
know
if
I
feel
up
to
it,
really.
You
don't
look
that
great
but
If
you
ate
a
little
bit?
You
could
probably
wear
Just
leave
me
to
do
What
are
you
biding
on?
I'm
biding
on
a
table.
-
Are
you
coming
or
not?
I'm
gonna
go
change.
Have
a
good
time!
We
waited
often,
stuff
which
I'm
really
sick
It
just
that,
it's
a
hard
frustration...
takes
people
down.
Come
on.
Can
I
introduce,
um...
-
Aaron
and
Alisha.
Hi.
-
Hi.
So
we
are
at
The
Unholy
Masquerade.
It's
great.
This
is
my
mask.
Which
I
made
for
the
occasion.
Hey!
-
Jackie.
-
This
is
undead
party.
You...?
I'm
a
vampire.
I'm
a
vampire!
-
Great.
-
So,
um,
who
bit
you?
-
Oh
great.
Okay.
Deacon!
Pretty
rude,
because
she
was
my...
...
servant.
She
was
a
pretty
useless
servant.
I
wouldn't...
Yeah,
yeah,
but
still,
...
appreciated
if
you'd
asked...
How's
Stu?
He's
good.
He's
here.
-
Oh,
his
here?
Hey,
hey!
Hey!
Has
anyone
looked
at
you
Ah,
no...
Can
you
hear
me
at
the
back?
On
behalf
of
the
Wellington
...
uh,
with
lower-hat
vampire
And
the
Kurory
Zombie
society,
We're
raffling
a
live
big
pet
this
year,
the
prize
over
here
on
my
left.
It's
a
wonderful
prize.
I
thinks
it's
a
10
dollars
each
or
Now
without
further
ado,
to
introduce
to
you
Pauline
Ivanovich!
Thank
you.
That's
The
Beast.
Thank
you.
The
Beast
is,
uh,
the
name
She
prefers
Pauline.
We
had
a
very
intense
relationship.
We
were
very...
...
sexually
explosive.
Last
time
I
saw
her,
she
impelled
me
and
She
said...
...
all
kinds
of
things
that
really
hurt
me.
And
all
this
while
I
was
impelled
Well,
everyone,
I
will
be
mingling
around
...
I
will
meet...
...
all
of
you.
Hello.
That's
the
new
guy.
What,
what
kind
of
vampire...
Did
you
see
his
face?
Oh...
oh.
-
Hello!
-
This
is
Deacon.
-
This
is
Stu.
-
How
are
you
my
friend?
Hi.
Stu.
You
got
really
warm
hands
too.
You
a
demon?
-
No,
he's
not
a
demon!
-
Stu,
Stu,
Stu...
Go
dance,
uh,
with
anyone.
-
Sure.
I
like
Stu.
He's
not
vampire,
or
a
zombie...
-
Am
I
a
witch?
He
not
uh...
he's
neither,
Excuse
me,
excuse
me.
Um,
Nick...
Do
you
mind
if
Stu
is
killed?
Uh,
I
don't
feel
real
good
about
it.
Can
I,
can
I
just
ask
you,
you
know,
a...
-
...
a
personal
question?
Are
you,
um...
...
are
you,
are
you,
Uh...
If
anyone's
gonna
eat
him
is
gonna
be
us
but
They
can
just
go
fuck
themselves.
Nick!
It
is
your
fault.
Okay?
You
brought
a
human
-
You're
not
helping.
Plus
one.
Lovely
talking
to
you,
See
you
later
on.
As
soon
as
one
vampire
takes
a
bite,
-
A
frenzy!
Okay,
follow
me,
follow
me.
Excuse
me,
sorry
guys.
Okay,
Stu.
Put
that
over
your
red
face.
-
Just
going
out
for
a
cigarette.
-
Okay,
not
that
way.
-
This
way.
-
Get
away
from
the
vampires.
Excuse
me
everyone!
Can
I
have
your
attention
please.
Some
of
the
vampires
forget
They
brought
a
human.
And
they
don't
let
us
to
feast
on
him.
This
was
a
total
misunderstanding.
There
was
on
the
invitation,
...
the
invitation,
it
said,
-
plus
one,
but
it
did
not
specify...
-
Wait,
look...
if
it
could
be
werewolf
or...
Yeah,
but
he
could
be
He
could
texting
his
mates,
saying,
come
on
over.
Well,
he's
not,
he's
not
doing
that.
How
do
we
know
that?
He's
wearing
a
bow-tie,
look
at
him!
Stu,
tell
them
what
you
do.
Come
on
Stu!
Tell
them
what
you
do,
Stu.
-
Hi,
my
name
is
Stu
uh...
-
I
can't
hear
Stu.
Hi,
my
name
is
Stu,
uh,
I
work
in...
-
I
can't
hear...
Stu
can't
hear,
they
cannot
hear
you.
Hi,
my
name
is
Stu.
I'm
a
software
analyst.
I
work
for
a
geographic
-
Uh...
I
work
for
a
company
that
does
basically
we
take
like
Then
we
analyze
those
requirements
and
to
fit
those
requirements.
He
is
a
virgin.
He
is
a
virgin!
-
I
can
smell
a
virgin
of
a
thousand
paces.
Take
your
thousand
paces
I
can't
wait
till
you
moan
them.
There
should
be
no
eating
of
the
human.
Who
are
you
all
of
a
sudden?
You
have
forgotten
your
former
lover.
So
quickly.
Georgie?
No,
not...
...
Georgie,
like,
5-years
Saturday.
No.
Wait
a
minute.
Just
one
moment.
No...
No,
I've
got
it,
Hello
Beast.
Hello
asshole.
-
Hey,
don't
call
me
asshole!
...
Beast.
This
is
Vladislav.
This
is
me
ex-boyfriend.
-
You
know,
the
one
who
fucked
the
police...
-
...
personal
business.
-
Nice
to
meet
you
asshole.
You
will
not
feast
on
the
blood
Listen
asshole,
this
is
a
human
and
this
is
the
rules
and
One,
and
then
another
one,
They're
making
a
documentary
on...
This
is
a
private
secret
society
mate,
you
don't
go
bringing
your
You
will
not
eat
Stu
and
Maybe
one
camera
guy...
I'm
up
to
bloody
here,
And
all
your
mates
behind
there,
We're
gonna
eat
the
human
being.
And
there's
nothing
Now
back
off!
And
let
my
misses
get
her
way.
Oh,
there's
nothing
I
can
do
about
it?
-
That's
right.
Diego,
rip
his
head
off.
What
do
you
want?!
Vampire
fight!
Get
him
Vladislav!
Rip
his
head
off!
He's
killing
him!
It
is
forbidden
for
vampires...
...
to
kill
a
vampire.
-
What
the
f...
What?
Are
you
okay,
love?
We
should
probably
go
Stu.
It
was
great
to
see
you,
-
Pauline.
Perfect.
-
That
was
very...
how
we
both...
We
both,
together,
Yeah,
but
it
was
more
Stu
I
hope
this
doesn't
make
this
awkward
No,
I
think
it's
opened
up
Oh,
no.
Here
we
go
again.
Stu,
Stu,
Stu,
Stu!
Stu,
Stu,
STU!
Stu,
Stu,
Stu,
Stu...
-
Stuuu...
Stuuu...
Listen,
listen!
You
smell
that?
This
way.
Werewolves.
-
Oh,
no.
-
Piss
off.
There
has
been
no
hassle
here.
Well,
let
it
stay
that
way.
Keep
chaining
yourselves
up!
Guys,
where's
your
track
suite
pants?
It
was
washing
night.
My
misses
couldn't
wash
them
cause
When
your
legs
expand
-
Oh!
You've
lost
all
those
trousers,
guys?
Declan,
that
tree's
far
too
thin!
Look
at
it!
It's
like
a
branch!
You
don't
know
how
big
you
get
That's
the
wrong
tree
for
you.
Anton,
I've...
Oh,
no,
you've
forgot
the
combination.
Why
did
you
get
a
combination
lock?
I
lost
my
key
last
time.
Okay,
well,
it's
probably
4
zeros,
-
Fuck
off
to
a
tree.
Werewolves,
not
swearwolves.
Yeah,
I
know,
well
on
transformation
nights,
it's
alright,
alright?
I
was
just
reminding
you.
Stop
talking
and
chain
yourself
up
Honestly,
we're
transforming.
Alright,
we'll
keep
walking.
Yeah,
keep
walking.
Is
it
fur?
Oh,
for
crying
out
loud.
Don't
look
at
the
fur
everyone.
-
That's
disgusting,
man.
Declan!
-
That's
not
real
fur.
Honestly,
get
out
of
here.
The
guy
in
the
bow-tie,
he's
gonna
go
first!
Get
out
of
here!
Take
all
your
coats
off
Take
that
army
service
jacket
off...
Get
that
camera
out
of
my
face!
Go,
go!
Let's
go,
let's
go.
Come
on!
Run,
Stu,
RUN!
Let's
go,
let's
go!
-
They're
coming,
guys!
I
got
one!
My
leg!
My
leg!
Oh,
God!
Stu!
Stu!
STU!
Stu!
Get
off
me!
Stu,
are
you
alright?!
Stu!
Stu!
Ah,
fuck!
Fuck
off!
Get
off
me!
You
stinky
piece
of
assholes!
Stupid
werewolves!
Look
away
Nick!
Don't
look
at
their
blood!
Stu!
He's
a
really
good
dude!
It's
too
late
for
him!
-
Don't
look
at
the
blood
Nick!
There
he
is.
He's
probably
still
a
little
upset
best
friend
disemboweled
by
werewolves.
Nick!
I
found
you.
Whoa!
That
was
pretty
full
on,
heh?
But
this
is
what
happens
You
have
to
watch
everyone
die.
You're
mother
and
father.
All
your
friends.
Sometimes
brutal.
Like
slipping
and
falling
Or
falling
asleep.
In
an
autumn
pile
of
leaves,
and
having
some
of
them,
Or
making
the
simple
mistake,
of
fashioning
a
mask
out
of
crackers,
and
being
attacked
by
ducks.
Geese.
Swans.
Or
simply
dieing
of
old
age.
But
even
old
age
is
brutal.
Watching
your
friends...
...
grow
old.
They
can't
piss.
And
they
say
stupid
things
and
can't
remember
anything.
And
then,
one
day,
they
can't
even
And
you
wish
they
were
dead.
And
then
they
do
die.
No.
If
I
know
Stu...
...
this
was
probably
the
way
Disemboweled
by
werewolves.
Blood
and
guts,
splat
onto
the
trees.
His
face
torned
to
shreds.
I
hope
I
made
you
feel
better.
Ah,
well,
from
what
we
it
looks
like
there's
been
That's
really
what
happens,
dangerous
dogs.
Um,
straits,
not
being
looked
after.
This
is
not
good.
No,
not
good
at
all.
There's
nicer
ways
to
go,
by
what
looks
like
a
pack
of
dogs,
I
say
so.
These
attacks
have
been
happening
more,
They're
happening
on
a
monthly
bases
and
Specially
not
the
dogs.
I've
got
the
bastard.
One
of
them
here,
hey?
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
End
of
the
day,
What
a
shame.
Look
what
you
did.
Hey?
He's
got
the
scent
again,
hasn't
he?
Yeah.
They
say
that
vampires
hearts
Definitely
dead.
-
Bye
Stu.
It
was
lovely,
loose,
knit.
But
I
don't
know.
Deacon!
Deacon!
Deacon,
wakey,
wakey.
Hey!
You
don't
sleep
in
here.
You
want
to
get
sizzled
to
a
crisp.
You
know,
you
could
think
Okay.
-
Sorry
Viago.
Night,
night!
Okay.
Received
at
4:20
AM:
-
Stu?!
-
Stu!
Good
to
see
you.
Look
at
his
face!
I
saw
them
tear
you
to
shreds!
Look!
He
looks
like
Seal!
They
didn't
kill
me.
-
It
looks
cool.
Meet
some
of
our
friends.
Anton,
Deacon.
Hi,
Anton.
I
must
have
blacked
out.
And
then,
I
remember,
-
an
ambulance.
O'Leary.
O'Leary!
Yeah,
coming!
-
Okay,
calm
down,
mate.
Looks
like
rabies,
doesn't
it?
And
I
don't
know
how
long
after
that
was,
And
it
was
daytime.
And
I
couldn't
find
my
clothes.
Those
werewolves
guys...
...
eventually
found
me.
And
they
had
some,
they
like,
lent
me
some
pants.
So,
yeah,
those
guys
Cause
I
was
quite
confused.
Yeah,
these
are
the
guys
who,
um,
turned
me
into
a
werewolf.
You
knit
your
own
jersey?
-
Yes.
-
I
knit.
-
Yes.
Ah,
this
is
a
nice
place.
Please,
don't,
ah,
don't
lick
anything
or...
...
pee
on
anything.
We
were
worried
at
first,
'Ooh,
they
are
just
going
to
But
they
actually
are
really
polite
There
was
obviously
that
werewolves
smell,
which
permeated
the
entire
house
But
we
opened
some
windows
and
'What
a
stupid
suggestion,
No
way.
You
know,
walking
into
the
vampire's
den.
That's
my
hand.
But
I
thought,
we'll
give
it
a
shot.
You
know,
I'm
the
alpha
male,
I'm
the
alpha
male.
-
Yes.
...
all
of
the
other
guys
follow
me.
-
For
Stu!
Thanks
guys.
What
have
you
done
to
your
face?
I
got
attacked
by
some
werewolves.
Army
is
a
werewolf.
So,
Katherine
is
a
vampire
now.
-
Yes.
We
just
thought,
the
hell
with
it,
you
know.
What
have
we
got
to
lose?
I
was
just
sitting,
doing
nothing,
and
he
came
floating
in
and
over
to
me,
and
I
recognized
him.
And
then
I
bit
you
on
the
neck.
That's
right.
And
I
don't
mind
being
a
vampire.
I'm
enjoying
it.
Some
people
freak
out
a
bit
Uh,
they
think,
'what's
this
96-year
old
for
times
her
age.'
-
And,
you
know,
I
don't
care...
No,
they
can
call
me
cradle-snatcher,
I
decided
to
bite
her
and
-
Wonderful.
Pauline
and
I
are
tentatively
back
together.
But
it's
not
long
before
broke
up
in
the
first
place.
We
start
in
our
bedroom,
and
I
need
that
totally
boarded
up
or
My
husband
is
my
familiar.
So,
there
has
been
a
dynamic
shift
there.
You
could
buy
a
Bedazzler.
I
feel
like
I'm
where
I
need
to
be
now.
-
I
love
you.
Great.
But
I
am
your
Master.
-
Okay?
Yeah,
these
guys
have
to
laugh
Yeah!
That
is
a
good
one.
I
always
look
round
to
Like,
if
I
see
one
of
them
is
not
'You
laughing?',
What
are
you
laughing
at,
Justin?
-
Hey?
-
Just
then?
Oh,
I
don't
know.
Ah,
test
failed!
