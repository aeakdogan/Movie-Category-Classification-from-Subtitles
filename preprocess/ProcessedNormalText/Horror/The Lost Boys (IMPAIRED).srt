That's

I
keep

touches
the

There's
another

around
here,
Don't
touch
anything.

is
exactly
where
I
want
it.

you

Don't.

Hi.
Aren't
we
friends
anymore?
Sure.
"Sure."
Does
that
mean
we
are,
or...?
MICHAEL:
We
are.
Then
let's
act
like
friends.
Let's
talk.
Michael,
take
off
your
glasses.
LUCY:
Michael,
look
at
me.
If
there's
a
girl...
I'm
tired,
Mom.
LUCY:
We
could
talk
about...
We
can
talk
about
anything
I
have
more
serious
things
on
my
mind
Things
I'm
dealing
with...
Things
I
wouldn't
understand?

GRANDPA:
Hey...
Looks
like
I
wasn't
the
only
one

SAM:
Did
you
take
care

SAM:
What's
the
wine
for?
LUCY:
My
apology
to
Max
for
running
out
Which,
young
man,
you
should
be
making.
SAM:
Mom.
I
better
bring
this
up
to
the
house
SAM:
All
right,
I'll
be
here.
Hi,
Thorn.

LUCY:
Sam?

Sam!

Mom!


LUCY:
Honey,
get
in
the
car!
SAM:
The
dog
chased
my
mom...
...like
the
Hounds
of
Hell
EDGAR:
We've
been
aware...
...of
some
very
serious
vampire
activity
Santa
Carla
has
become
a
haven
As
a
matter
of
fact,
...ghouls
and
werewolves
Kill
your
brother.
You'll
feel
better.
Look,
guys,
my
brother
is
not
It
says
here
that
...all
half-vampires
will
return
to
normal.
SAM:
Guys,
if
my
brother's
a
vampire,
Does
he
know
who
the
head
vampire
is?
SAM:
No,
I
don't
think
so.
Then
you'll
have
to
kill
him.
And
if
you
don't...
...we
will.
It
all
started
when
my
mom
Max
never
comes
in
till
after
it's
dark.
The
dog
who
chased
my
mom
Listen
to
this:
"Vampires
require
"...to
watch
over
them
as
they
sleep.
"Fierce
dogs,
the
Hounds
of
Hell,
No
shit.
What
happens
if
my
mom
is
dating
SAM:
You
could
nail
him
"Truth,
Justice,
Thanks
to
you
two.
We'll
check
out
Max.
Sam.
GRANDPA:
Smells
good.
When
do
we
eat?
I
told
Max
eight
o'clock.
GRANDPA:
Max?
Are
we
going
to
have
company
again?
LUCY:
Again?
You
haven't
had
company
in
this
house
Right.
Now
we're
gonna
LUCY:
Michael,
Max
is
coming
to
dinner.
I
can't.
I
have
plans.
Michael...
Things
will
change
around
this
house
Hey...
MAX:
How
you
doing?
And
you
must
be
Max.
Right.
How
are
you?
Well,
you're
the
man
of
the
house...
...and
I'm
not
coming
in
until
you
invite
me.
You're
invited.
Thanks
very
much.
MAX:
Hello.
LUCY:
Oh,
hi.
I
didn't
hear
you
come
in.
MAX:
Is
it
okay
for
the
guest
You're
thinking
of
the
groom
Oh,
yeah.
I
always
get
those
confused.
MAX:
Thorn
sends
his
apologies.
Tell
him
I'm
walking
again.

He
promises
to
behave
if
you
come
back.
SAM:
Mom?
These
are
my
dinner
guests.
Edgar
and
Alan.
The
Frog
brothers.
I
didn't
know
you
were
having
guests.
If
we'll
be
in
your
way,
we
can
eat
No,
no,
there's
plenty
for
everybody.
Max,
this
is
my
son,
Sam,
EDGAR
&
ALAN:
Mm-hmm.
MAX:
Lucy,
this
looks
terrific.
LUCY:
Well,
I
hope
it
tastes
good.
MAX:
Tastes
wonderful.
LUCY:
Boy!
Somebody
around
here
LUCY:
Nanook,
would
you
quit
Nanook,
get
upstairs.
Go
on.

You
want
some
Parmesan
cheese
on
that?
Yeah,
Sam.
Thank
you
very
much.
LUCY:
Sam
grated
the
cheese
himself.
MAX:
A
budding
chef
in
the
family.
Are
you
all
right?
It's
not
cheese,
it's
garlic.
You
hate
garlic,
don't
you?
No,
I
like
garlic.
It's
just
too
much...
It's
raw
garlic.
Garlic?
How
did
that
happen?

Guys,
he
likes
garlic.
Here.
Quick,
drink
some
water!
Sam,
what's
the
matter
with
you?
Does
it
burn?
Burn?
Are
you
nuts?
It's
freezing!
LUCY:
Look
at
your
suit,
Max.
Oh,
I'm
so
sorry.
LUCY:
Now
what?
SAM:
Must
be
a
circuit
breaker.
EDGAR:
He's
not
glowing.
SAM:
I
know.
Hit
the
lights.
Aah...!
Sam!
What's
gotten
into
you
tonight?
I
think
I
know
what's
going
on
here.
You
do?
MAX:
Yeah.
I
know
what
you're
thinking,
Sam.
-
I
am?
I'm
not
trying
to
replace
your
father...
...or
steal
your
mother
away
from
you.
MAX:
I
would
just
like
to
be
your
friend.
Good
night,
Lucy.
LUCY:

Thanks
a
lot!
I'm
sorry,
Mom.
LUCY:
Max,
I'm
so
sorry.
Major
mistake.
Our
batting
average
isn't
terrific,
is
it?
You
were
so
sweet
to
him.
I
don't
know
what
got
into
him.
Kids
Sam's
age
need
discipline,
He
doesn't
run
over
me.
Protecting
mother.
MAX:
Listen...
Let's
try
it
once
more.
Dinner,
my
house,
tomorrow
night.
-
I'm
cooking.
LUCY:
Bye.

Where
is
she?

Take
it
easy,
Michael.
Where's
Star,
David?
DAVID:
If
you
ever
want
to
see
Star
again...
...you
better
come
with
us
now.



DAVID:
Michael,
over
here.
You
don't
want
to
miss
this.

[Rap
music
continues,
DAVID:
Initiation's
over,
Michael.
Time
to
join
the
club.


Come,
Michael.



DAVID:

Michael.
Michael.

MICHAEL:

No!
[Eerie
organ
music
plays,
wind
howls,
Now
you
know
what
we
are.
DAVID:
Now
you
know
what
you
are.
You'll
never
grow
old,
Michael.
And
you'll
never
die.
But
you
must
feed.


I
wish
Grandpa
would
stop
giving
me
SAM:
Aah...!
I
know
who
I
am
now,
Sam.
Don't
kill
me,
Mike!
I'm
basically
a
good
kid,
so
don't
kill
me!
SAM:
I
can
help
you.
Just
tell
me
who
the
head
vampire
is.
I
thought
it
was
Max,
but
I
was
wrong.
SAM:
Just
work
with
me
STAR:
Michael!
STAR:
Michael!
SAM:
It's
that
girl
from
the
boardwalk.
-
I
have
to
talk
to
you.
Can
I
come
up?
MICHAEL:
You
shut
the
window

She's
one
of
them!
And
don't
tell
me
it
doesn't
make
her
MICHAEL:
You
know
where
David
Who's
David?
Yes,
and
it's
my
fault.
STAR:
If
you
hadn't
met
me,
I
tried
to
warn
you.
It
was
that
night
in
the
cave,
wasn't
it?
That
wasn't
wine
they
gave
me
to
drink.
MICHAEL:
That
was
David's
blood.

You
drank
someone's
blood?
I'm
just
like
David
now,
Star.
No,
you're
not.
You're
like
Laddie
and
me.
-
We're
not
one
of
them...
Why
didn't
you
kill
me
last
night?
You
were
supposed
to
be
my
first.
That's
what
David
wanted.
But
I
couldn't,
Michael.
Why?
Because
you
care
so
much
about
me?
Yes,
I
do.
MICHAEL:
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
wanted
to
tell
you
But
for
me
it
gets
I'm
weak.
Why
did
you
come
here
tonight,
Star?
I
was
hoping
you
would
help


Star!
Don't
kill
anybody
until
we
get
back
to
you.
MICHAEL:
What
are
you
doing?
SAM:
I've
got
connections.


Okay.
Where's
Nosferatu?
-
Who?
The
night
crawler.
The
bloodsucker.
El
Vampiro.
Mike,
they're
here!

SAM:
Grandpa,
okay
if
we
borrow
the
car?

EDGAR:
Weapons
check.
I
don't
want
you
going
down
there.
I'm
going.
Look,
this
isn't
a
comic
book,
Sammy.
So
are
the
Frog
brothers.
EDGAR:
Check
me.
SAM:
Who'd
you
rather
have
go
down
there
If
something
happens
down
there,
This
time
I'll
protect
you.
Even
though
you're
a
vampire,
EDGAR:
Listen,
just
so
you
know:
If
you
...l'll
stake
you
without
even
Chill
out,
Edgar.
Where
did
you
say
you
met
these
guys?

EDGAR:
Holy
shit!
ALAN:
Vampire
hotel!
EDGAR:
Here's
one.
Let's
stake
her!
MICHAEL:
Don't
you
touch
her!
Stay
away
from
her!
EDGAR:
Come
on,
vampires
have
MICHAEL:
Star.
EDGAR:
The
rest
of
them
have
got
MICHAEL:
Star?
MICHAEL:
I'm
taking
you
out
of
here.
STAR:
Please?
I
feel
a
draft.
EDGAR:
Let's
check
it
out,
Sam.
SAM:
I'll
be
right
back,
Mike.
I
hope.
EDGAR:
Come
on,
Sam,
let's
go.
Move
out!
Move!
SAM:
Flies!
EDGAR:
We're
on
the
right
trail.
Flies
and
the
undead
go
together,
Come
on!




What's
that
smell?
Vampires,
my
friend.
Vampires.


EDGAR:
Come
on!
SAM:
It's
freezing
in
here.
SAM:
It
looks
like
a
dead
end.
They
must
have
hidden
their
coffins
SAM:
There's
nothing
here.
Let's
go,
guys.
EDGAR:
Jesus!
SAM:
I
thought
they'd
be
in
coffins.
EDGAR:
That's
what
this
cave
is.
It's
one
giant
coffin.
Right
now
they're
at
their
most
vulnerable.
EDGAR:
Easy
pickings.
Remember,
you
just
have
to
kill
the
leader.
EDGAR:
We
don't
know
which
one
he
is.
I
guess
we'll
just
have
to
kill
them
all.
ALAN:
Let's
start
with
the
little
one.
What
was
that,
a
little
vampire
humor?
SAM:
It
wasn't
funny.
No!
Good
night,
bloodsucker!
SAM:
No!


You're
dead
meat!

[David
roars
demonically,
EDGAR:
Get
him
into
the
sunlight!
ALAN:
Get
him
into
the
sunlight!

Tonight...
SAM:
Mike!
Start
the
car!
Mike...
Mike!
SAM:
Start
the
car.
Mike!
ALAN:
We
blew
it,
man!
We
lost
it!
-
We
unraveled
in
the
face
of
the
enemy!
They
pulled
a
mind-scramble
on
us!
I'll
drive.
ALAN:
We
don't
ride
with
vampires.
Fine.
Stay
here.

-
We
do
now.
EDGAR:
Come
on!
Burn
rubber!

EDGAR:
Christ!
SAM:
"Burn
rubber"
does
not
mean

Cool
it,
Nanook!
Your
dog
knows
a
flesh-eater
Take
him
outside,
Sam.
SAM:
Come
on,
Nanook.
GRANDPA:
Michael.
Do
you
know
the
rule
...when
you
take
it
without
asking?
No,
Grandpa.
Now
you
do.
We
definitely
blew
Plan
A.
ALAN:
Time
to
activate
Plan
B.
SAM:
What's
Plan
B?
We
have
two
and
a
half
hours
SAM:
What
happens
then?
EDGAR:
The
sun
goes
down.

Mom.
Sam,
what
are
you
doing
here?
I've
got
to
tell
you
something.
Santa
Carla
is
crawling
with
vampires.
Mom,
I'm
serious!
SAM:
Edgar
staked
one
of
them.
Look,
there's
evidence
on
my
sweater!
Mom,
you've
got
to
tell
someone!
-
You've
got
to
tell
someone!
I'm
not
kidding!
They're
coming
Stop
it!
Right
now!
Stop
it!
-
But,
Mom...
I
don't
believe
you're
doing
this.
I
want
to
see
Max
tonight,
No,
I'm
not.
There's
nothing
wrong
with
Max.
I'm
not
talking
about
Max!
I'll
deal
with
you
later,
young
man!
SAM:
Mom?
SAM:
Guys,
we're
on
our
own.
EDGAR:
Good.


Grandpa...
Widow
Johnson
called.
We've
got
a
date
tonight?
I
guess
so.
She
said
not
to
be
late.
I
better
get
cleaned
up,
then.


Die,
Mr.
Vampire!

They'll
be
coming
for
Laddie
and
me,
They'll
be
coming
for
all
of
us.
STAR:
Laddie,
wake
up.


Aah...!
[Eerie,
dramatic
instrumental
music,
LUCY:
Oh,
it's
delicious.

Thorn,
stop
that!
What's
the
matter,
Lucy?
It's
just
old
memories
coming
back.
No,
seriously.
Well,
it's
something
Sam...
He
came
into
the
store...
It
was
just
a
kid's
imagination,
...he
seemed
so
sincere,
but...
It's
insane.
Tell
me.
I
promise
not
to
laugh.
Honest.
EDGAR:
I
think
I
should
warn
you
all:
When
a
vampire
dies,
No
two
bloodsuckers
go
out
the
same
way.
Some
yell
and
scream.
Some
go
quietly.
Some
explode.
Some
implode.
But
all
will
try
to
take
you
with
them.



Nanook!
I
left
him
outside.
EDGAR:

ALAN:
Sam,
come
back!
ALL:
Sam,
come
back!



Michael,
they're
coming!
STAR:
They're
coming!
Hurry
up,
man!

MICHAEL:
Take
them
upstairs!



-
I
say
we
terminate
them
right
now.


You're
mine.
You
killed
Marko.
Yeah.
You're
next.
No.
You're
next.
Garlic
don't
work,
boys.
Try
the
holy
water,
death
breath!








SAM:

Mike.
Mike.
SAM:

Mike,
wake
up.






You
missed,
sucker.
Only
once,
pal.



Death
by
stereo.


SAM:
Come
on.




Hey,
it's
me.
Are
you
okay?
I
nailed
one
of
them
downstairs
EDGAR:
We
trashed
the
one
We
totally
annihilated
EDGAR:
And
Nanook
helped
a
little.
SAM:
Death
to
all
vampires!
EDGAR:
Maximum
body
count.
We
are
awesome
monster
bashers!
The
meanest!
The
baddest!


Holy
shit!
The
attack
of
Eddie
Munster!
Get
him!
Stop!
Get
away
from
him!
He's
just
a
little
boy!

Ya...!
You're
afraid
to
face
me,
David?

DAVID:
I
tried
to
make
you
immortal.
MICHAEL:
You
tried
to
make
me
a
killer!

You
are
a
killer.


My
turn.

Stop
fighting
me,
Michael.
Join
us.
Never!
DAVID:
It's
too
late.
So
is
mine!


"Thou
shall
not
die
"Thou
shall
not
fear
"Thou
shall
not
kill"
STAR:
Michael!

SAM:
Mike!
MICHAEL:
Don't
let
them
see
me
like
this.
SAM:
Michael?
MICHAEL:
Get
away,
Sam.
SAM:
Michael,
what's
wrong?
What's
the
big
deal?
EDGAR:
It's
all
over.
MICHAEL:
Nothing's
changed.
STAR:
He's
right.
I
don't
feel
any
different.
Then
there's
still
one
more.
LUCY:
Sam!
Michael!
I'll
handle
Mom.
Come
on,
go.
SAM:
Don't
let
her
see
the
bodies.
LUCY:
What
happened?
Where
is
Michael?
What
happened
to
your
face?
What
happened
to
your
face?

LUCY:
I
don't
want
to
hear
another
word
MAX:
I'm
sorry,
Lucy.
This
is
all
my
fault.
David
and
my
boys
misbehaved.
I
told
you,
boys
need
a
mother.
Max,
what
are
you
talking
about?
I
knew
it!
You're
the
head
vampire!
Sam,
don't
start
this
again.
You're
the
secret
Who's
this?
ALAN:
But
you
passed
the
test.
Don't
ever
invite
a
vampire
MAX:
It
renders
you
powerless.
Did
you
know
that?
Of
course.
Everyone
knows
that.
Has
everyone
gone
crazy?
It
was
you
I
was
after,
all
along,
Lucy.
LUCY:
What?
I
knew...
...that
if
I
could
get
Sam
and
Michael
...there
was
no
way
you
could
say
no.
Where's
Michael?
It
was
all
going
to
be
so
perfect,
Lucy.

Just
like
one
big
happy
family.
Your
boys...
MAX:
and
my
boys.
Great.
"The
Bloodsucking
Brady
Bunch."
I
still
want
you,
Lucy.
I
haven't
changed
my
mind
about
that.
I
didn't
invite
you
this
time,
Max!
Michael!

Michael!
Don't
you
touch
my
mother!

MAX:
Don't
fight,
Lucy.
SAM:
Mom,
don't!
SAM:
Don't
do
it,
Mom!
Mom,
don't
do
it!






SAM:
Are
you
okay?
EDGAR:
We
kicked
their
ass,
man.

STAR:

It's
over.
Star,
Star!
Laddie!

Is
everybody
okay?
Oh,
Michael.
LUCY:
Oh,
my
boys.
How
much
do
you
think
Dad.
LUCY:
Dad?
Dad,
are
you
all
right?
One
thing
about
livin'
in
Santa
Carla
All
the
damn
vampires.

"People
are
strange
"When
you're
a
stranger
"Faces
look
