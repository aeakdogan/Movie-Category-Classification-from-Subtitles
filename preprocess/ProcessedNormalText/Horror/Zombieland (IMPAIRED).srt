"Oh,
America"
I
wish

could
tell
you
that
But
I've
come
to
realise
that
And
there
are
no
people
here


No
my
friends...
this
is
now

It's
amazing
how
quickly
thing
can
go
from
And
why
am
I
alive,
It's
because
of
my
list
of
rules.
Rule
number-1
for
survival
in
Zombie
land...
When
the
virus
struck,
for
obvious
reasons,
Poor
fat
bastard!
As
the
infection
spread
It
wasn't
enough
You'd
have
to
get
a
gun
Which
leads
me
to
my
second
rule
In
those
moments
when
you're
not
sure
Don't
get
off
stingy
with
your
bullets.
And
this
lady
could
have
avoided
Would?
Could?
It
wasn't
long
before
When
you
are
at
your
most
vulnerable,
Oh
God
Damit
God
Can't
a
Guy

Don't
let
them
catch
you
Rule
number-3
"Beware
of
Bathrooms"
As
zombie
began
to
outnumber
humans
That's
when
you
have
If
the
girls
in
your
neighbourhood
are
now
Oh,
maybe
it's
time
to
stop
You
have
to
focus,
on
your
own
survival,
Pretty
basic.


"Fasten
your
seatbelts"
It's
going
to
be
a
bumpy
ride.

That
guy
down
there,
is
me.
I'm
in
Garland,
Texas.
That
may
look
like
Just
2
months
and
I
might
be
I
may
seem
like
an
unlikely
survivor
but
I
had
the
advantage
of
never
having
I
survived
because
My
rules.

"Rule
number-1:
Cardio"
-Shit.
"Rule
number-1:
Cardio"
-Of
course.
"Rule
number-4:
Seatbelts"
-Motherfucker.
"Rule
number-2:
Double
Tap"
On
the
bright
side,
Another
rule
to
surviving
Zombie
land:
And
I
don't
mean
just
luggage.
I've
always
been
kind
of
a
loner,
I
avoided
other
people
Now
that
they
are
all
zombies,
So
I'm
on
my
way
from
my
college
dorm
Where,
Im
hoping
my
parents
Even
though,
we
were
never
really
close,
Or
any
face
that
doesn't
have
blood
dripping
-Thank
you.
-
What
are
you
looking
for?
I
had
this
list.
-No
one
back
there
but
-What's
your
name?
-Stop,
no
names.
Keeps
us
-You
almost
knocked
off
-
That's
okay,
you
don't
have
to...
-
Where
are
you
headed?
-You?
-Tallahassee.
-
More?
-You
know,
Tallahassee
and
-
So?
-
So,
Tallahassee,
-Here's
the
deal,
Columbus...huh
-and
I'm
sensing
you're
a
bit
of
a
bitch
-
I'll
get
this
relationship
to
about
uh,
Texarkana.
You're
a
pappy
little
spit
fuck
-
You

might
want
to
buckle
up,
you
know
for
safety.
Even
though
teaming
up
I
figure,
I'll
be
safer
You
see
he
was
in
the
ass
kicking
business,
and
It
became
quickly
apparent
that
-
What
are
we
doing
here?
-Yeah,
I
see
that
-I
could
use
a
Twinkie.
-
You
coming?
-
Are
you
fucking
with
me?
You
should
actually,
limber
up
as
well
especially,
-I
don't
believe
in
it.
You
ever
seen
a
-
Snow-balls..?
-
Where's
the
fucking
Twinkies?
-I
hate
coconut.
-Oh,
this
Twinkie
thing
-This
may
be
a
bad
time,
but,
-
Really?
I
know.
Again?
I
have
a
case
of
chronic
anxiety.
It
is..
I've
always
been
kind
of
I
find
lots
of
things
disturbing.
Like
undertone,
or
department
store
centres,
But
the
thing
I
fear
more
than
anything,
Fucking
clowns.
When
you're
afraid
of
everything
that's
out
there,
Which
is
what
happened
to
me
Friday
night.
World
of
War
craft.
Leaning
tower
of
pizza
boxes.
Pride?
Dignity?
Virginity?
My
whole
life,
And
fall
in
love,
Then
again,
since
my
folks
are
a
couple
Maybe
this
girl
could
bring
me
And
then,
I'll
finally
be
a
member
of
-Please,
is
anyone
home?
I
don't
usually
unlock
my
door
...but
my
neighbour
406
-Thank
you.
Thank
you,
-Nice
to
meet
you.
-
Mountain
Dew?
-And
here's
some
Gold
Grams.
-The
zip
lock
bags
keep
them
crisp.
-Okay.
-
Tell
me,
what
happened?
-And
was
walking
home
from
the
bar
-And
then,
he
just
came,
sprinting
towards
me.
-I
mean,
not,
not
running,
-I
thought
you
know
he
was,
like
maybe
-or
after
them...the
last
time
I
saw
-
Drunks
maybe?
-
I
didn't
even
told
you
the
worst
part.
-
Yeah?
-
You
are
right,
that's
the
worst
part.
-No
no
no,
you
should
be
scared
-That's
like
the
right
kind
of
scare,
-You
know,
I
get
scared
for
things
-Clowns,
with
red
noses,
or
like
-when
you
finishes
eating,
-
Really?
-And
as
long
as
you're
by
my
side,
-Do
you
mind
if
I
just
-
No,
of
course,
of
course.
Set
aside
the
feverish
homeless
cannibal
-I've
had
always
my
whole
life
-Goodnight.
-Oh
my
god.
-Are
you
okay?
-Okay
okay
okay.
-What're
you
doing?
-Look,
stay
back
406,
okay?
-Shit.
Oh
my
god.
-You
see,
you
just
can't
trust
anyone.
The
first
girl
I
let
into
my
life
-Listen
to
me,

-If
you're
in
there..

-Yeah,

-Out

So

sad,

about

a
ride.
-You
can
go,
see

yourself,
or
settle
somewhere
new.
I
could
tell

knew
what
I
was
feeling.
We
are
all
orphans
in
Zombie
land.
-I
know
this
Pacific

thing
is
nuts,
-but,
it's
been
so
long
since
she
got
to
be

It's
tough
growing
up
in
Zombie
land.
-There,
you
can
take

-Well,
I,
-hope
you
find
whoever
it
is
you're
looking
for.
-And
don't
let
go,
once
you
do.
It
wasn't
just
because
I
had
nowhere
else
to
go.
It
was
cause
in
that
moment
it
became
clear.
Wherever
this

was,
that's

wanted
to
be.

first?
I
really,
really
want
to
impress
Wichita,
but
it
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
Rule
#17,
Don't
be
hero.
-
Why
don't
you
take
this
one.
-
Don't
mind
if
I
do.
What
do
you
think?
Zombie
kill
of
the
week?
Close,
but
no
cigar.
Zombie
kill
of
the
week
goes
Poor
flat
bastard.
-
Perfume?
-
Is
that
perfume?
-
It's
cologne.
-
I'm
thinking:
"Lance
Magnifique"
-
Why
don't
you
speak
up,
-
Oh
my
God.
Wish
granted.
She
spent
the
Good
luck
now
Petunia.
-
Ok,
let
me
begin
my
three-part
apology
by
saying
that
I
think
you're
a
wonderful
-
FYI,
I
beat
wholesale
ass
-
I'm
sure
-
Thank
you.
Come
on,
break
another
one.
Nice.
Doesn't
that
feel
good.
Sometimes
Tallahassee's
right.
Even
if
that
means
destroying
-
What
smells
like
perfume?
-
You
don't
know
who
Willie
Nelson
is?
-
Willie
Nelson.
-
Yeah
I
shave
every
morning
but
sometimes
by
like
4:30
I
have
a
thing...
-
Since
this
is
a
freeway.
You
can
get
it
up
to
65,
-
You
don't
want
to
go
more
than
20.
-
Do
not
worry
about
it.
Blind
spots,
-
So
do
you
never
strap
in
or
just,
when
on
road
trips?
there's
zombies
everywhere.
-
Yeah
that's
true.
..seat
belts.
-
Yes
but
no,
she's
not.
she's
not.
She's
only
famous
when
she's
-Okay,
right.
-
This
is
kind
of
freeing.
For
the
first
time
in
a
long
time,
we
were
having
fun.
So
even
though
it
ran
counter
we
decided
to
stay
together
-
You
know
I
think
sleep
deprivation
is
like
No,
I
think
it
moth
be
number
two.
-
Number
two..
-
I'm
just
saying
we
should
find
a
place
to
crash.
We're
in
Hollywood,
let's
sleep
in
style.
Grab
a
map.
-
Come
on.
-
It
seems
like
everyone
who
has
-
What
exactly
do
you
think
-
I
kind
of
pictured
Tom
Cruise
-
B..listed
compared
to
who
I
got
in
mind
folks.
We
are
going
to
the
Tipi
Top
of
the
A-list.
-
Who?
-
Hey,
here's
a
big
BM.
-
It
isnt
Bob
Marley.
-
This
place
is
incredible.
-
Ladies
and
Gentlemen,
-
Oh,
Bill
Murray
-
God,
no
way.
This
guy
has
a
direct
line
-
Boy,
who's
Bill
Murray?
-
I
have
never
hit
a
kid
before,
-
Who's
Gandhi?
-
She's
twelve.
-
No
Twinkies.
-
See?
I
told
you
we
should've
gone
to
-
Hello,
inside
voices,
okay?
-
At
least
until
we
know
we
are
alone.
-
Hey
Tallahassee,
Wichita
-Little
Rock
come
here.
-Why
do
I
get
stuck
with
her?
-It
doesn't
seem
to
end.
-Hey
come
here.
-He
has
his
own
movie
theatre?
-Ok,
I'm
going
to
teach
you
-The
king
slept
right
here.
-Dibs
on
the
bed.
-Too
soft
for
me
anyway.
-Oh,
this
is
so
exciting,
you're
about
-Ghostbusters.
-This
is
pretty
catchy.
-Help
me
with
the
boots,
come
on.
-Ok,
I'll
get

myself.
-Bill
Murray,
you're
a
zombie?
-You're
not
a
zombie,
you're
talking.
-You're
okay.
-
The
hell
I
am.
-Are
you..What's
with
the,
-Oh,
I
do
it
to
blend
in,
you
know
-Buddy
of
mine,
make-up
guy,
-Corn
starch,
you
know
some
berries,
-It
suits
my
lifestyle.
You
know
I
like
to
get
out
and
do
stuff.
-Just
played
nine
holes
at
the
Riviera,
-Goddamn
it,
-I
had
to
get
that
out.
-This
is
so
surreal,
I
mean.
You
probably
-but
I'm
such
a
huge
fan
of
yours.
-I've
seen
everyone
of
your
movies
a
million
times.
-I
even
love
your
dramatic
roles,
everything.
-Six
people
left
in
the
world,
-I
know
that's
not
your
middle
name.
-But
I've
been
watching
you
since
I
was
like..
-You
know
"A
former
greens
keeper
-
That's
why
we
do
it.
-
I
love
you
Bill,
I
love
you.
-
Thank
you.
-
You
are
staring
at
me,
it's
a
hairpiece
it's
a..
-
Sorry,
it's
just
that
you
look
remarkably
like
Eddy
Van
Helen.
-
I
Just
saw
Eddy
Van
Helen.
-
Really?
-
Where?
-
Well,
how
was
it?
-
That's
a
tough
break.
-
So
how
about
a
little
west
coast
hospitality.
Can
I
get
you
something?
What
would
you
like?

-
Oh
hurry,
hurry
he's
on
the
ceiling.
Come
get
him.
Oh..
-
Light

up
Murray.
-
You're
so
disgusting.
-
Don't
cross
the
streams.
-
I
don't
want
to
cross..
-
"35
feet
long,
weighing
approximately
600
pounds"
-
Your
sister's
single,
right?
There's
nothing
long-distance
or
anything.
-
No.
-And
if
she
had,
like,
a
type
-
if
you
can
have
a
type
-
what
would
that
be?
-
She
kind
of
goes
for,
like,
bad
boys.
-
Really?
-
That's
cool.
-
So
Columbus
is
the
scared
one?
-
I'll
get
him.
-Watch
this.
-
It's
okay,
it's
okay.
I
got
him.
Is
that
how
you
say
hello
where
you
come
from?
-Oh
my
God,
Oh
my
God
I
can't
believe
I
shot
Bill
Murray.
-Mr.
Murray?
Just
Bill
I
think
now.
-
Bill?
-
I
don't
think
we're
going
to
be
able
to
stitch
this.
-
Owe,
that's
still
tender.
-
You
think
you
might
pull
through?
-
No.
-
If
it
means
anything
now
I
am
so
sorry.
-It
was
just
instinctive.
-
It
was
my
bad.
-I
was
never
a
very
good
practical
joker.
-
So
do
you
have
any
regrets?
-"Garfield",
maybe.
-
I'm
sorry,
he
just
gets
me.
-But
it
still
is
sad.
-
Sorry.
One
second
-It's
a
double-barrel
so..
-Okay.
-3,
2,
1.
-
You
guys
want
some
caramel?
-
Oh
Free
parking,
which
coincidentally
-is
the
best
thing
about
Zombie
land.
-
No,
best
thing
about
Z-land:
You
know
"Rob
Curtis
is
gearing
up
for
Friday".
Who
cares.
-
The
best
thing
is
no
more
flushing,
epic.
-
And
worst
thing?
-
You
mean
other
than
the
-
That's
easy.
-
Losing
Bob.
-
That's
his
puppy.
-
I
tell
you,
I
never
thought
-The
day
he
was
born
I
just
lost
my
mind.
-
Sorry.
He
had
my
personality,
Laugh?
And
that's
when
it
hit
me.
Me
with
the
best
cardio
in
the
business
to
realize
-
We
made
this
wallet
together

Take
away
a
man's
son,
you've
-
I
haven't
cried
like
that
since
Titanic.
-A
hint?
-then
squeeze
the
trigger.
-
Don't
make
me
drink
alone.
-It
1997,
"
Gorgeous"
-
I
never
took
French.
-Gorgeous
day
what
the
hell?
-
It's
a
97?
-
Was
that
a
good
year?
It
was
a
great
year,
are
you
kidding
me?,
-Anaconda.
-
First
tattoo,
a
porpoise.
-
Really?
-
First
kiss.
-Scotty
Lynch
-
Did
you
guys..
use
tongue?
-
Maybe.
-
Are
you
jealous
of
Scotty
Lynch?
-
Actually
I
think
I'm
jealous
of
your
whole
1997.
-
Let's
see
mine.
-First
orthodontist.
The
bastard
gave
me
head
gear.
-
I
got
my
first
B.
-
Frightening,
as
Anaconda
-Wood
shop,
which
doesn't
really
count
as
a
class
anyway.
-Had
my
first
school
dance.
-I
was
Sadie
Hawkins..
-girls
choice.
-
What
nobody
picked
you?
-
Is
was
girls
choice.
-
Those
bitches!
-No,
I
will
not
stand
for
this,
you
know
what?
-On
behalf
of
all
the
eight-grade
girls,
-I
would
like
you
to
make
it
up
to
you.
Relax,
Scotty's
old
news.
-I
don't
even
know
your
name,
-You
know?
Between
you,
me
and
-You're
actually
kind
of
cute.
-
You
think
so?
-
I
mean
you
got
the
guts
of
a
guppy,
but
I
could
hit
that.
-
Really?
-
I'll
at
least
give
you
the
intentional
walk
to
first.
-
Hey
little
help
moving'
a
couch.
-We're
making
a
fort.
-
That
was
probably
for
the
best,
cause
I
like
you,
Columbus,
but
my
sister
and
I
are
going
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
survive
so..
I
was
hoping
Wichita
was
just
playing
hard
to
get,
but
I
realized
that
she
had
more
trust
issues
than
I
did.
When
I
woke
up
the
next
day
and
she
was
leaving.
-
You
are
like
a
giant
cock-blocking
robot,
-developed
in
a
secret
fucking
government
lab.
-
I
can't
believe
I
almost
kissed
him.
What's
our
rule?
-
Trust
no
one,
just
you
and
me.
-
Yeah,
you
and
me.
-
You
have
just
survived
the
zombie
apocalypse
-
Where
are
you
going
to
go?
Open
Sesame.
This
is
the
problem
with
When
they
leave
you
just
feel
lost.
Having
Tallahassee
around
didn't
comfort
me,
-
Hey,
you
weren't
exactly
going
to
score
anyway.
-
You
weren't
storming'
the
trenches
before
I
came
along.
-That's
why
I
don't
let
people
close,
you
only
get
burned.
-
You
don't
say.
-Mexico,
you
know
what
they
call
Twinkies
-That's
where
I'm
headed
amigo.
-
Whatever.


-Oh
no!
-
I'm
going
after
Wichita.
-
You
ever
read
that
book
"She's
just
not
that
into
you"?
-
You
can't
make
yourself
too
available.
-Have
fun
in
Mexico.
-Come
on!
Hurry!
-
Get
in!
-
Come
on,
come
on!
-
Come
on,
come
on!

-
On
the
count
of
three.
Are
you
okay?
Come
on.
-Hurry,
get
up.
-
Come
on,
let's
go.
-
There!

I'm
not
good
at
separating,
so
.
That
will
be.
-
That's
the
worst
goodbye
I
have
ever
-
Tell
the
ladies
I
said
hey.
-
You
know
there
are
pictures
of
-
Hop
in
the
car
Evil
Knives.
-
Thanks.
-
Go!



-
Not
as
fun
as
I
remember.
-
Shoot
the
control
box.


-
Columbus.
-
I
think
they
might
actually
require
our
-
Buckle
up.
-Time
to
nut
up
or
shut
up.
-Holy
shit.
-My
mama
always
told
me,
-Who'd
have
guessed
that
-
Probably
nobody.
-
Look!
-
We
better
start
working
on
our
apology.
-Oh
no
no
no!
-Hey
hey
-Hey
-Oh
my
God!
-Hey
hey
-
They're
up
there,
they're
okay.
-
What
are
you
waiting
for?
-
Come
on!
-
Anybody
hungry?
-Tallahassee-nice
over
here.
-Come
on,
come
on
you
ugly
bastards.
-
Holy
Shit!
-
Holy
Shit!
-Hey
hey
-
Shit,
I'm
out
of
shells.
-
Here
we
go.
-
Wichita!
Little
Rock!
Oh
my
God.
Look
at
this
fucking
clown.
Of
course,
it
had
to
be
a
clown.
No,
it
had
to
be
a
clown.
And
it
had
to
be
Wichita
that
some
rules
are
made
to
be
broken.
Time
to
nut
up
or
shut
up.
Fuck
this
clown.
-
Thanks.
-Wichita
-
Christa.
-
Ok,
we
should
probably
head
out,
now.
-
Finally
he
got
to
first
base.
-Not
bad
for
that
scrawny
little
spit-fuck.
-
Where
is
Tallahassee
-
I
have
a
little
hunch.
-Where
are
you
spongy
yellow
-
False
advertising!
-
You
want
a
Snow-Ball
or
something?
-
Oh
God!
-Words
cannot
express..
-
It's
too
soon.
-
Do
you
think
you
can,
maybe,
just
pick
out
-
No!
-No!
-
No!
That
face.
That's
me
realizing
in
that
big
black
truck
and
that
big
guy
in
that
snakeskin
jacket
they
were
the
closest
to
something
A
family.
I
trusted
them
and
they
trusted
me.
Rule
number-32
Tallahassee
got
his
Twinkie
and
even
though
life
will
never
as
he
savoured
that
spongy
yellow
log
of
cream,
we
had
hope,
we
had
each
other.
And
without
other
people,
you
might
swell
be
a
zombie.
-
Thank
you
so
much
So
until
next
time
remember:
Cardio,
seat
belts
and
this
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything,
I'm
