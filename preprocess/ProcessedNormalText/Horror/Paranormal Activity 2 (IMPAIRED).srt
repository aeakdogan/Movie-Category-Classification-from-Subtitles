How

-

Happy.

We

to
keep
him

Yeah.

Guess
who
changed
-
This
guy,
right
here.
Guess
who
was
in
labor
-
This
girl.
-
Hi.
Hi.
Hunter,
this
is
Martine,
She
will
probably
-
because
I
won't.

Yes.
Oh,
my
goodness.
Look
at
this.
-

He's
cute,
right?

He's
kind
of
smooshy
He's
just
newborn,

Seriously,
Just
touch
him

You
see
how
tiny
he
is?
Do
you
mind
if
I
take
him?
but
I
want
to
take
him
Mm.
OK.
He's
not
sleeping.

That's
Abby.
Bye,
sweetie.
This
is
a
fireplace.
-

Oh.
And
that's
why
you're
watching

This
is
your
room.
There's
your
crib.
Just
got
some
"Hunter."
See?
Pretty
cool.
This
is
your
sister's
-

No,
I'll
Wassup,
brother
-

What?
You're
never
allowed
to
come
in
In
which
case,
it's
gonna
be
By
the
way,
that's
my
bathroom.

That's
half
your
bathroom.
It's
actually
my
bathroom,
All
that
is
mine.

This
is
the
living
room
This
is
my
first
man
cave.
That's
where
all
This
is
the
second
man
cave,
where
we're
gonna
watch
This
is
my
50-inch
monster.
-

I
don't
even
know
It's
just...
Yeah.
Hi,
baby
boy.
Hi.
Hi.
-

He
smells
good.
-

You
make
poops
all
the
time.

-
Is
that
good?

OK.
Is
a
special
baby??

-
Thank
you.
-

-
Hey!
Let
me
see
this
baby.
-

Aunt
Katie!

He's
upstairs.

Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

You
are
so
Hi.

I
already
love
you
so
much.
-
My
sister
did
good.
You
probably
had
a
little
-

Very
little.

It's
her
boyfriend.

Kinda
just

Hello,
baby.
-

Dad,
my
burger?
-
Right,
sorry.
-

Nice.

I
want
you
to
meet...
-
Wait.
Does
it
stay
on?

It
does
stay
on,
Oh,
no,
of
course
not.
-
That
would
ruin
it.
-
Swear
to
God,
I
will
kill
you.
Perfect
handoff
right
there.
She's
my
only
niece.
Not
really,
but
I
think
of
her
She's
my
step-niece.
-

Aww.
-
I'm
the
evil
step-aunt.

The
evil
step-aunt?
Well,
I'm
not
really
evil,
-

-

-
There
can
be
only
one!

I
can't
believe
-

Where's
Micah?
He
wasn't
up

I
can't
find
the
tape.

That's
fine,
I'm
just
Can
you
get
Abby
out
of
here,
We
just
got
back
and
the
whole
Nothing
seems
to
be
missing.
But
that's
what
Make
sure
we
document

This
is
our
foyer.
My
daughter
Ali's
room.
It
just
feels...
gross

Master
bedroom.
Yeah,
so
that's
great.
-
Your
watches
are
still
there?
The
only
thing
missing

Oh,
sweetie.
This
is
horrible.

It's
the
nursery.

As
far
as
I
know,

This
is
our
basement.
I
don't
see
anything
really

I
don't
think
they
-
What
is
that?

Is
that
Abby?
-
Oh.
Your
bikes
are
still
here.
-
Not
that
you're
using
those.
-

And
the
-
This
looks
like
-
Right?

I
don't
know,
kiddo.

What
are
you
-

So
this
is
it.
Um...
-
the
place
was
-
Hello.
Pretty
much
every
room
in
the
Put
one
up
here,
and
then
you
get
the
front
door,
One
over
there,
you'd
get
this
door
Or
have
one
in
here,
getting
all
these

They
run,
like,
Yeah,
they're
You
can't
get
away
That
stuff.
Corner
up
there,
so
you
get
-
of
this
door,
that
door.
And
you
get
to
see

You're
not
putting
one
-
Yeah.
What?
Put
a
camera
that
sees
in
-
Yeah,
really?
-
Yeah,
OK,
that'd
be
sweet.
Little
tiny
hole.
-

Can
you
put
one

And
then
we
can,
Yeah,
so,
I'm
gonna
close
It's
hidden.

How
many
are
we
getting?
I
don't
know.
But
what'd
you...?
-
I
don't
know.



What
are
you
doing


Yeah.
Go
get
it.
You're
super
fast,
big
man.
What's
Martine
doing?
What
is
she
doing?

-


You're
a
good
puppy.
Hey,
Hunter.
Hunter,
What
are
you
doing?
What's
up,
Martine?
-
Wassup?
What's
up,
Ali?

What
were
you
doing?
When
you
were,
like,
All
crazy
like.
No...
crazy.

You're
just


The
house
is...
No.

-

You're
getting
-

OK.
All
right.
-
The
good
ones...
-

We
keep
the
good
ones.

In
with
the
good,
Yay!
In
with
the
paella,
Holy
crap,
-
Whee!
One,
two,
three.
Whee!
-


Whee!

Oh,
I
almost
got
him.
-
One,
two...
Oh,
my
God!
-

Oh!
I
wanna
throw
up!
It...
-

Ohh!
-

No,
you!
That
was
you!
-

Don't
blame

God,
there
was
like
-
She
clogged
it.
I
can't
look.
-
That
is
horrible.

You
are
grounded.
Awful.
This
is
the
best
bath...
-

It
looks
pretty
good.
Well,
if
you
come
in,
It's
so
quiet
and,
like,

I
love
Martine,
but
-
Yeah.
Um...
What
time
is
it
now?

7:20.
Something
like
that.
-
Oh,
like
an
hour
or
so.
You
should
definitely
pop
in.

I
don't
want
to
smash
you,
You
don't
want
to
smash
me?
-

Really?
Oh.
-
Let
me
release
the
Kraken.


Hey.
You're
OK.
Aw.
Aw.
I
gotcha.
You're
OK.
You're
OK.

Look,
it's
perfect,
right?
-

That's
a
lot

Here,
goofy
mug.

Do
you
need
anything?
-

Hey!
-
Thank
you
so
much.
-
I
was,
but,
uh...
-

Did
he
keep
you
up?
-
He
definitely
kept
me
up.
I
love
you
so
much.
-
I
love
you
so
much.
-
I
love
you
so
much.
You're
amazing.
I
don't
think
There's
coffee.
?
I
love
my
sister


Remember
that
time
-
for
like
six
hours?
-
That
was
a
difficult
time.
-
Making
bacon?
-
Good
morning.
Thank
you
for
loaning
out
-

What
up?
-
Tell
me
that's
not
yours.

Thanks
for
not
watching

I
did
watch
it!

It's
mine
and
hers.
Cool.
It's
HD.
-

-


How's
it
going?
-
Dude,
I
have
a
bone
I
went
into
Burger
King,
I
tossed
your
name
around
-
I
don't
own,
like,
-

He's
not
actually
I'm
still
in
the
process
and,
therefore,
the
house
should
Well,
yeah,
but
the
both
Like
you
have
your
beading
thing
and
then
I
have
my
area,
-
The
whole
rest
of
the
house?

I'm
telling
you,

Yeah,
get
it.
Whoa!
There
was
no
sign
They
trashed
our
whole
house.
See
that
thing
in
the
corner?
-
Are
you,
like...?


You
like

You're
such
a
ham.

Things
have
gotten
since
he
learned
how
-
Aw.

So
are
you
freaked

Yeah,
I
mean,
Oh,
sweetie?
Sweetie.
I
would
be
freaked
out,
somebody
had
broken

Well,
it's
just,
-
Yeah.

It
seemed
personal.
You
know?
I
don't
know,
I...
I
get
this
feeling,
What?

Mm.
Never
mind.
-

-
mac
and
cheese.
I'm
gonna
go
out.
-
Oh,
OK.
Where
are
you
going?
All
right,
well,
have
fun.

Bye!

Mac
and
cheese.

crazy.
-
Who
do
you
think
that
is?
No,
that's
your
Aunt
Katie.
-

That's
Katie?
I
thought
we
lost
all
That's
great.

-

Yo,
Martine?

Kristi
and
Dad

Shake

-

[speaking
softly
I
thought
I
was
gonna
have
Hey,
what
are

That's
enough,
Martine.

Martine,

I've
asked
you
It
is
not
good
-
Please,
put
it
out
right
now.
No
m?s,
no
m?s.
Put
it
out
right
now,
please.
-
OK,
that's
enough.
What
are
you
doing?
-
The
baby
is
fine,
OK?
The
baby
should
not
-

Just
stop
doing
it,
please.

Goddamn

God.
OK,
that's
like
two
months.


-
OK?
I
told
you.

I
do
understand,
OK?
I
don't
believe
It's
just...
I
cannot
have
that
-

OK.
Can
I
give
you
a

You
were
very
good
for
us.
-

Da-da.
Come

make
Daddy
proud.
Hunter,
look
over
here.
Hunter?
You
are
so
like
your
dad.
Sweetie.
Sweetie?
Come
on,
come
on.
What
are
you
looking
at?
-
Look
at
Mama.
Look
at
Mama.
-

Look
over
here.
There's
nothing
there,
goofball.
Where
are
you
going?
I
can't
see
you
back
there.
We
were
up
in
the
nursery,
to
get
him
to
say
"Da-da"
again,
He
was
looking
-
everywhere
but
me.
He's
got,
like,
an
attention
I
guess,
but
there
something
he
was
and
it
wasn't
-

Hey.
-
What's
going
on?
Check
this
out.
-
Dad,
can
you
Cool,
I'm
gonna
get
nail
polish
You
got
freaky
eyes.
Dad.
-
There
we
go.
Why
are
you
in
here?
-

Sorry,
crabby.
You're
Crabby
McRumpelstein.
-
Why
did
I
fire
Martine?

Because
I
didn't
like
her
-
witchy
stuff
around
Hunter.
It
wasn't
witchy...
It
made
her
feel
better,
She
was,
like,
slaughtering
-

No,
she
wasn't.
Good
luck
and
it's...
-
What?
Dad!
-

On!
Stop!

Let
me
get
one
more.
Oh!




-

Shh.
It's
OK.
It's
OK,
buddy.
Shh,
shh,
shh,
shh.


Ah,
no.
It's
OK,
buddy,
Is
that
what


-

-

-

Daniel?
God.
Nasty.

Dad,
don't
pick
it
up
-

Why
not?
They
can
have
diseases
-
It
flew
into
the
window...
I
don't
even
want
to
look
at
it.
-

What?

Oh,
my
God,
I'm
trying
to...

Why
did
you
-

I
don't
know.
-

Stop!
-

You're
really
mean.
-
Oh.
-

It's
really
sad.

You
like
the
ball?
Ball,
ball,
hit
it.
Smack
it!
What's
in
there?
Get
in.
-

Buddy,
buddy,
buddy,
buddy.
Hunter?
Oh,
shit.
Hunter,
come
here!
Come
here.




-

Fuck!

What
are
you
doing

Your
dog
does
Yo,
what's
the
deal
Honestly,
we're
not
really
sure.
Splash,
splash.
One,
two,
three.

This
is
the
cutest
thing
Splash,
splash,
splash.

I
think
I
might
to
replace
my
girlfriend
-
Uh-huh.
See?
We're
scared.
Flip
the
thing,
film
yourself.
-
Oh,
shit.
No.
I'm
definitely

I'll
bet
you
guys
Who
has
time
for
that?

How's
Daniel
Rey
Oh,
apparently,
we
have
a
ghost.

I
did
not.
Please
A
couple
pots
fell
off
our
pot
-

You
definitely
That's
the
most
logical...

She
thinks
everything
-
What?

Think
everything

You
don't
have
a
ghost.

Yeah,
you're
definitely
-
No.

Katie,
you're

You
don't
They
used
to
do,
like,
sances
-

No!
We
didn't
do
sances.
-
No.
You're
making
a
mountain
-

Katie...
-

What's
no
big
deal?
I
just
don't
talk
about

What
stuff?

They
used
to
do
sances
It's
really
not
that
funny.
The
truth
is,
when
we
were
kids,
we
got
a
little
freaked
out,
And
we're
having
a
good
day

We'll
explore
this
-
in
detail
later.
What
about
the
Lizzie
Borden

You're
thinking
How,
where
do,
how
would
I...
How
would
I
know
this
stuff

What's
your
take
I
think
it's
awesome.
How
could
I
put
it
up
wrong?
Once
it
goes
up,
it's
up.
You
were
probably
putting
it
on
the
edge
of
the
top
part,
The
fact
that
it
fell
a
second
-
that
you
put
it
up
You
want
me
to
show
No,
no,
no.
Then
why
the
pool
cleaner
For
the
last
week?
'Cause
it's
a
pool
cleaner,
-
How
does
it
get
out
at
night?
-
Yeah.
Is
it,
like...?
-
Oh,
come
on,
honey.
I
assume
somebody
takes
it
out
I
don't
take
it
out,
Ali,
do
you
take
the
pool
-
What?

No.
What?
So
it's
crawling
It's
crawling
I
don't
know.
You
wanted
all
the
cameras.
Fine,
let's
go
check
it.
-
You
serious?
We'll
find
out
what
else
is
-
Can
I
tape
it,
though?
-

What?

That
is
weird.
Maybe
I
have
it
set
too
high

No.
No,
I
don't,
I
don't
think

Maybe
That's
what
we
got
it
for.
It's
probably
trying
to
be

It's
like
Yeah,
it's
like
a
Flowbee,

I
don't
know
if
the
house
-

You
hope
it
is?
Are
you
kidding
me?

Why
would
you
hope
That'd
be
the
coolest
If
there
was
somebody
trying
to,
-
that
would
be
amazing.
Kristi
is
obviously
-
[makes
clock-like
She
doesn't
have
any...
Her
hormones
are
all
kooky.
...just
interpreting
them
Like,
she's
seeing
them
as,
And
maybe
we
should
just
Like,
I
think
we
should
-
We
could
go
full
out...
What?

Just
freaky.
I
don't...
Why
do
you
think
that
it
That's
all
I'm
asking.
-

How
would
it
be
good?




-

-

-

Hey,
guys.

There's
something
-

What
are
you
-
You're
freaking
me
out.
Honey,
what
are
What
are...
you
talking
about?
-
I
don't
see
anything.
-

-
Yeah!
Yeah!


Sweetie?


Come
on,
I
just,
I
hate
it
when
you

I'm
sorry,
honey.
I'm
just
trying
I
just
want
us
to

I
was
thinking

grownups?

Why,

Martine's
gone.
With
the
break
in,
and
all
I
just
don't
want

You
know,
we
can't
just
If
we
do
that,
-

I
miss
you,
you
know?
And
I
know
I've
been
kind
All
right,
so
all
the
emergency
Yep.

But
now
his
new
doctor

Mm-hm.

Mm-hm.

peanuts
on
anything.
Um...

too
wasted!
Bye!

you?
-
Lightly.
Have

You

spirit's
present,
Like,

Literally...

not
me.
"P"...

this?

What
the
fuck?
It
goes
to
the
"Y."
I
mean,
what,
what...

Pussy?!
Maybe
the
spirit...
-
Spirits?
-
at
the
moment.
-
You
never
know.
I
know
I
am.
You
know
what?
-
Wait,
do
you
feel
that?
No,
I'm
not
moving
it.
No,
this
time
-
It's...
Pussy-ehh.

No,
Ali,
I'm
really,
I'm
really

I
promise
you.
No,

fuck?

No.
"N"...

It's
like
the
worst


Did
you
spell
that?
Are

Yeah,

Would
you
like
me
I
