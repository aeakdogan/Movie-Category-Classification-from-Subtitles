CAROLYN-
There's
this
awful
smell,
Like
rotting
meat.
Uh...
What?
What
is
it?
Well,
rancid
smells
could
indicate
Oh,
my

ROGER-
That's

keep

Otherwise,
it's

Does
it
come

It
stops

Uh-huh.
Well,
sometimes
it's
meant
The

it
was

His
name's
Rory.

Hmm.
Why
is
that?
He
won't

We

at

from
the

so,
Well,
Lorraine
and
I
both
feel
that
An
exorcism.
What,
exorcism?
I
thought
that
was
something
LORRAINE-
We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
I'm
afraid
that's
not
gonna
help.
Lorraine
saw
something,
which-
Go
ahead,
hon.
I've
been
seeing
the
dark
entity
...and
your
Land.
I
saw
it
first
when
I
came
It
was
Latched
to
your
back.
And
then
I
saw
it
again
with
the
girls
And
it
doesn't
matter
where
you
go...
...this
dark
entity
has
Latched
itself
...and
it's
feeding
off
you.
Even
if
we
Leave?
Sometimes
when
you
get
haunted,
You
take
it
with
you.
LORRAINE-
Look,
I
gotta
tell
you,
...but
this
is
the
one
that
I'm
most
Okay,
so
what
do
we
do?
ED-
Performing
an
exorcism
is
an
archaic
And
even
then,
But
before
we
even
get
that
far,
It
means
we
gotta
investigate,
...and
that's
the
hard
part.
Have
your
children
been
baptized?
Uh,
no,
we
never
got
around
to
that.
Well,
you
may
want
to
rethink
that.
Why?
Because
we're
a
threat.
And
whatever
you're
dealing
with
here
So
far
it
hasn't
done
anything
violent,
So
we're
gonna
have
our
guy
...to
see
what
we're
up
against.
LORRAINE-

got
you
a
present.
