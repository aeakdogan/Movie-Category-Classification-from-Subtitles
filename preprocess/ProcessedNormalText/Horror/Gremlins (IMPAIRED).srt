RAND:
Peltzer's

That's
me
there

I'm
an
inventor.
And
I
have
a
story
to
tell.
I
know.
Well,
nobody's
got
a
story
Nobody.
lt
all
started
here
in
Chinatown.
I
was
trying
...maybe
find
a
present
I

Wait

RAND:
This

Go

BOY:
You

there's
one
thing
BOY:
Let
me
show
you.
The
Bathroom
Buddy.
It

You

yourself
...your
toothbrush,
a
toothpick.
...a
nail
file...
...and
you
got
yourself
This
is
gonna
revolutionize
traveling.
Let's
just
say,
...that
you're
on
a
bus,
You
forgot
to
brush
your
teeth.
You
got
yourself
a
bad
case
Bad
breath.
What
do
you
do?
No
problem,
friend.
...you
take
your
toothbrush
out...
...and
you
push
this
button.
That's
absolutely
no
problem.
Cleans
up
easily.
What

sir,
Rand
Peltzer.

RAND:
What

that?
BOY:
What's
he
doing?
Singing.
He

that
sometimes.
I

him.
Tell
you

you
$1

for
him.
RAND:
I've

looking
for.
I've

That's
$200!
I'm
sorry.
Mogwai

RAND:
Grandfather!
With
mogwai
comes
much
responsibility.
I
cannot
sell
him
at
any
price.
Wait
outside.
I'll
be
right
out.
Just
go.
Okay,
mister,
here
it
is.
What
about
your
grandfather?
Forget
what
he
said.
He's
crazy.
Do
you
want
it
or
not?
I
want
it.
BOY:
There's
three
rules
RAND:
BOY:
He
hates
bright
light,
It'll
kill
him.
And
keep
him
away
from
water.
But
the
most
important
rule,
...no
matter
how
much
he
cries
...never,
never
feed
him
RAND:
Thanks.

Barney?
Give
him
to
me.
I'll
take
him
to
the
kennel.
It'll
be
quick
and
painless,
What
could
you
do?
I'll
catch
the
beast
myself.
Then
he'll
get
what
he
deserves.
A
slow,
painful
death.
Maybe
I'll
put
him
in
my
spin
dryer
That'd
do
it.
Barney!
BlLLY:
CORBEN:
I
have
a
very
weak
heart.
What

This

Very
good,

He
wouldn't
hurt
you.
Excuses,

sentimental
Imagine

a
lot
of
people
around

that?
It's
when

lot
of
people
I
always
thought
everyone
was
happy
Most
people

but
some
aren't.
While
everybody

up
presents,
Cheery
thought.
It's
true.
The

depressed
on
Christmas?
I
don't

Oh,

lt
was

horrible.
It
was
Christmas
Eve.
I
was
9
years
old.
Me
and
Mom
were
decorating
the
tree...
...waiting
for
Dad
A
couple
hours
went
by.
Dad
wasn't
home.
So
Mom
called
the
office.
Christmas
Day
came
and
went,
So
the
police
began
a
search.
Four
or
five
days
went
by.
Neither
one
of
us
Everything
was
falling
apart.
It
was
snowing
outside.
The
house
was
freezing,
so
l
went
That's
when
I
noticed
the
smell.
The
firemen
came
and
And
me
and
Mom
were
expecting
And
instead
they
pulled
out
my
father.
He
was
dressed
He'd
been
climbing
down
the
chimney...
...his
arms
loaded
with
presents.
He
was
gonna
surprise
us.
He
slipped
and
broke
his
neck.
And
that's
how

found

Don't
