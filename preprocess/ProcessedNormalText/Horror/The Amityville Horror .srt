This--
This
is
a
mistake.
How's
that?
No,
I
mean
your
ad
in
the
paper.
This
is--
It's
gotta
be
a
misprint.
...and
I
know
what
a
place
And,
you
know,
if
this
is--
Well,
if
this
is
true,
then
this
is
a--
And
what
is
wrong
with
that?
-Come
on.
-There's
a
vibrant
history
here.
In
fact,
the
house
was
built
The
rest
of
the
house
was
added
It's
one
of
the
oldest
Dutch
Colonials
Wow,
that's
impressive.
This
room
would
be
perfect
And
the
view's--
There's
a
boathouse.
Oh,
all
you
need
now
Actually,
George
has
a
speedboat.
This
place
sounds
And
this
is
your
basement.
As
you
can
see,
It
can
be
a
game
room,
Well,
Iet's--
Let's
have
a
Iook.
I'II
just
wait
up
here.
Yep,
Iooks
Iike
a
basement.
So,
what
do
you
guys
think?
-I
think
you
Iook
foxy
in
that
skirt.
Yes,
yes,
okay?
It's
a
value.
It's
a
value
Okay,
Iook,
if
we
do
this,
we're
We
deserve
this,
George.
You
deserve
this.
How
many
times
you
tell
me
-Kathy--
-We'II
make
sacrifices.
Yeah,
I
understand
that.
...this
is
the
Iife
we
want.
-We're
happy?
She's
happy.
I'm
broke.
Hold
on,
hold
on,
hold
on.
So
Iook,
I
gotta
ask,
There's
always
a
catch.
There
was
a
tragedy,
a
crime...
-...a
murder.
In
the
house?
Several
people,
a
family.
But,
you
know,
we've
moved
on,
It
is
a
distant
memory
now.
And
the
house
is
fine.
Really.
Doesn't
it
seem
kind
of
strange
Well,
houses
don't
kill
people.
People
kill
people.
Just--
Excuse
us.
Do
you
think
we
can
make
it
work?
You
know
what?
You
want
it,
-Really?
...and
you
can,
well...
-...sell
one
of
the
kids.
A
Iittle
one.
We're
rich!
We're
rich!
We're
rich
in
something,
Wait.
-You
say
your
prayers?
-What
did
you
pray
for?
Why
don't
you
tell
him
the
truth.
-What?
William.
Nobody
answered
me
when
Don't
say
that.
Sometimes
things
happen
in
Iife
Billy,
Iook
at
me.
I
need
you
to
give
George
You're
not
being
disloyal
He
doesn't
want
to
be
anything
...and
maybe
one
day
Nobody
will
ever
For
you
too?
For
me
too.
How's
