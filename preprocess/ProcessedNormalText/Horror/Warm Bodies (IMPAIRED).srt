R:

What
am
I
doing
I'm
so
pale.
I
should
eat
better.
My
posture
is
terrible.
People
would
respect
me

What's
wrong
with
me?
Why
can't
I

Oh,
right.
I
shouldn't

all
dead.
This
girl
is
dead.
That
guy
in
the
corner
Jesus,
these
guys
look
awful.
I
wish
I
could
but
I
don't
remember
I
mean,
I
think
but
that's
all
I
have
left.
I
can't
remember
my
name,
Although
my

Sometimes
I
look
and
try
to
imagine
You
were
a
janitor.
You
were
the
rich
son
You
were

And
now
you're
a
Corpse.
I
have
a
hard
time
how
this
whole
Could
have
been

an
airborne
virus,
or
a
radioactive
But
it
doesn't
really
matt.
This
is
a
typical
day
I
shuffle
around,
unable
to
apologize
It
must
have
been
when
everyone
could
and
communicate
and
just
enjoy
A
lot
of
us
have
I
don't
know
why.
People
wait
at
airports,
but
I'm
not
sure

Oh,
man.
They
call
They
don't
bother
us

But
they'll
eat
anything
I
mean,
I
will

at
least
We
all
become
them
some
da.
At
some
point
You
lose
all
hope.
Oh,
man,
gross...
Stop.
Stop,
Oh,
this
is
what
It's
kind
of
a
bummer.
I
don't
want
to
be
this
wa.
I'm
lonely.
I'm
lost.
I
mean,
I'm
literally
lost.
I've
never
been

Wonder
if
these
guys
Wandering
around,
Do
they
feel
trapped?
Am
I

with
me?
Okay.
I've

my
dad
You're
safe
here
After
that
I
don't
know
How
did
you
die?
I
don't
remember.
How
old
are
you?
Because
you
could
be
but
you
could
also
You
have
one
And
I
can't
even
smell...
He
doesn't
smell
rotten.
I
don't...
Nora,
he
didn't
come
here
Why
did
you
come
here,
R?
To
show
everyone...
Show
them
what?
That
we
can
change.
R,
no
one
here

Not
that
we
could
As
soon
as
they
saw
you,
they
would
blow
Wait

other
choice

Still,
we'd
have

much
time.
We
could
fix
him
up.
What?
I
have
some
makeup
that
obviously
Yeah.
Yeah,
we
could.
We
could
put
on
maybe
a
little
blush.
No
way.
Yeah,
way.

Would
you
change
What?
It's
funny.
No,
it's
not.
Fine.

There
we
go.
Oh,

Nothing.
It's
