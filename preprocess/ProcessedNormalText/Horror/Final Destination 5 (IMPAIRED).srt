Oh,

Not

Hey,
Stan,
how's
it
going?
Uh,

Sam,

Did
you
just
correct
me?
SAM
:
look
at
me.
-What's
my
name?
look
away.
All
set,
Pete?
Yes,

What's
the
one

Wasted

Three

Retarded?
It's

I

years
on
you

You

Listen,
if
you
think
I'm
gonna
sit
here--
Not
a
good
idea,
Roy.
We're
fine
for
the
day.
Why
do
you
let
him
get
away
with
that?
No
choice.
He's
the
union
rep.
I
fire
him
and
suddenly
But
I'll
win
him
over,
even
if
it
kills
me.
What

you?
When
are
they
gonna
offer
you
-They

did.
SAM:
I
mean,
they
wanna
send
me

how
long?
I
just
thought
Although

I'm
not
so
sure.
Well,

Aw,

going
on?

DENNIS:
ISAAC:
DENNIS:

SAM:
How
did
you
know?
MAN:
How
did
you
know?
It
says
right
here
in
your
statement:
"l
saw
it
collapse.
That
sounds
premeditated
to
me.
No,
no,
no.
That's
not
what
I
meant.
I
had
a
vision.
Okay.
A
vision.
Psychic
phenomena,
ghosts,
Bigfoot.
You
actually
believe
in
that
stuff?
I
don't
know.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
believe:
There's
an
answer
for
everything.
There's
an
answer
for
why
...the
bridge
was
going
to
collapse,
I
told
you,
I
saw
it
coming.
I
just
did.
And
no
one
else
did?
Like
I
said,
it
just
came
out
of
nowhere.
Did
Sam
have
issues
with
authority?
Did
he
ever
demonstrate
No.
Wait.
"Extremist
behavior"?
You
mean
like
a
terrorist?
You
see
him
talk
to
anyone
that
morning?
Just
his
girlfriend.
His
ex-girlfriend,
I
mean.
Molly.
-But
that
was
in
person.
Ex.
BLOCK:
Was
he
upset?
Scale
of
1
to
10.
It's
personal.
You
must
have
been
pissed,
right?
What
does
that
have
to
do
I'm
just
trying
to
get
all
the
pieces
...before
I
start
moving
them
around,
Lack,
I
just
had
a
hunch
that
something

Excuse
me.
Forensics
came
back
with
the
analysis.
-And?
...and
structural
damage
"High
winds"?
AGENT:
You're
free
to
go.
I
have
a
feeling
Call
it
a
hunch.
WOMAN
:
Authorities
are
calling
...a
freak
act
of
nature...
...citing
a
highway
improvement
project
Among
the
survivors
were
eight
employees
...on
their
way
to
a
business
retreat.
The
other
17
employees
And
although
they've
been
branded
...the
surviving
employees
NATHAN:
MOLLY:
PETER:
Anybody
know
When
Dennis
gets
here,
I
guess.
That
agent
still
hounding
you?
No.
You
heard
the
news,
Yeah,
more
like
supernatural.
How
you
holding
up?
I
tried
calling.
No,
yeah,
I
saw.
I
was
just
tired.
ISAAC:
How
did
you
explain
it?
I
didn't.
I
couldn't.
Sam,
there
had
to
be
a
reason.
Heh.
That
is
exactly
Whatever
answer
you're
lacking
for,
Yeah,
Sam's
right.
We
should
all
just
put
it
behind
us
Definitely
beats
the
alternative,
right?
DENNIS:
...and
I
see
family
members,
friends.
But
the
people
that
left
us
on
the
bridge
People
like
Jennifer
Alcott...
...Chris
Boylan...
...David
Buckler.
Maybe
you
worked
next
to
them.
Maybe
you
worked
for
them.
But
we
all
worked
with
them,
huh?
Who
can
forget
Trevor
Wino's
smile?
Or
Isaac
Palmer.
Did
he
just
say
my
name?

-That's
not
funny.
I
just
get
weird
with
tragedies.
I'm
sorry.


Guys.
Death...
...doesn't
like
to
be
cheated.
Excuse
me?
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
You
all
just
be
careful
now.

Let's
just

just
doesn't
make
sense.

every

She
said
she
didn't
wanna
do
it.
She
said
she
wasn't
ready.
And
I
should
have
stopped

I
should
have
done
something.

wasn't
anything
How
do

know?

I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.

freaked
out
Does

mean
anything?

I
don't
know
yet,
but
thank
you,
Dennis,
Stranger.
Should
we
maybe
have
code
names
Over
and
out.
All
right,
ahem,
I
don't
think
I
can.

I
mean,
I
could
try
it
a
hundred
times

is
some
freaky

felt
great.

Oh,
yeah.
Awesome.

sterilized?
No,

Wait

second.
You
understand
that.
You

Oh.
All
right,

know
what?
Let's
do
this.
I
said

follow

it,
you're

Ow,
ow.
Okay,
it's

it's
definitely
in.
How
many
of
these
are
you
gonna

Oh,
uh,
hey,
Hey.
That's
not
very
nice,
you
know.
Okay,
your
thumbs
are
kind
of
I'm
not
gonna
lie,
it's
a
little
annoying.
Once
again,

Oh.
Hey!

Hello?!

SAM:
Tc
Paris?
Yeah,
you
know,
you
said
it
yourself.
Start
over
with
me.
How
many
drinks
have
you
had?
Enough.
Molly,
I'm
serious.
Lack,
you
were
right.
But
I'm
not
willing
to
lose
you.
Why
does
it
have
to
be
I'm
better
when
you're
with
me.
Uh,
guys,
you're
not
gonna
believe
this.
They're
saying
it
was
a
freak
accident.
Yeah,
raise
your
hand
Who
dies
during
a
massage?
Seriously.
PETER:
It
can't
be
a
coincidence.
It's
not.
Where
are
you
going?
NATHAN:
SAM:
Who
are
you?
You
were
at
the
cemetery,
What
are
you
doing?
My
job.

SAM:
What
makes
you
think
I
know
anything?
SAM:
At
the
memorial
service.
It's
just
that
I've
seen
this
before.
You've
seen
what?
A
lucky
few
survive
a
disaster.
And
then
one
by
one,
You
changed
things
on
that
bridge.
There's
a
wrinkle
in
reality.
So,
what,
we're
doomed
to
die?
I
mean,
is
that
it?
We
just
get
our
lives
back,
Are
you
saying
that
we
can't
stop
this?
You
were
supposed
to
die
on
that
bridge.
You're
not
supposed
to
be
here.
You
shorted
Death.
So
you
let
Death
...and
then
you
take
their
spot
All
the
days
and
years
And
they
take
your
place
in
death.
Then
the
books
are
balanced.
Wait
a
minute.
We
kill
someone,
we
get
I
don't
make
the
rules.
I
just
clean
up
after
the
game
is
over.

Maybe
that's
why
They
weren't
supposed
to
survive,
No.
No,
not
all
of
us.
Molly
made
it,
she
didn't
die.
What?
Well,
when
I
had
that
vision,
...I
got
you
across
You
survived.
You
saved
her?
Why,
because
you
decided
that
she
That's
not
what
he's
saying.
I
don't
You
deserve
to
live
Whoa,
Peter,
hang
on.
NATHAN:
You're
not
drinking
the
Kool-Aid,
Killing
people
I
may
not
know
what's
going
on,
Yeah?
What
else
is
it,
then?
Shit.
We
need
to
tell
Olivia.
Come
on.
OLIVIA:
MAN:
I
see
that
it's
been
quite
a
while
What
made
you
decide
Uh,
well,
a
lot
is
going
on
in
my
life...
...and
I
just
don't
wanna
miss
anything...
...you
know,
important.
Same
reason
I
had
it
done
myself.
-Came
on
in
back.
Let's
get
you
started.
Oh.
LEONOTTI:
Yep,
that's
the
first
step.

Here
we
are.
Come
on
in.
What's
with
these?
Oh,
just
for
some
of
And,
um,
sometimes
our
older
ones
too.

What
was
that?
Relax.
You
know,
it
lacks
a
lot
worse
Okay,
I'm
gently
going
to
...and
I
want
you
to
tell
me...
...when
this
feels
snug.
I
can't
move
my
head.
Perfect.
Just
what
we
want.
There
we
go.
Okay,
now
comes
the
fun
part.
And
you
will
feel
a
little
numbness
...which
is
a
good
thing.
Deep
breath.
Relax.
Very
good.
Thattagirl.
There.
That's
not
so
bad,
is
it?
Looks
good.

-What
was
that?
I'm
just
gonna
enter
some
data
into
....
Dottie!
Dot--
Do
you
know
what?
I'll
be
right
back.
OLIVIA:

Is
that
supposed
to
be
happening?!




Help
me!
Olivia
Castle.
Where
is
she?
SAM:
She's
fine.


Help
me!
Help
me!

DOTTIE
[DOTTIE
&
DETECTIVE
Sam.
Stay
with
me
tonight,
please.
Of
course.
Five
different
systems
had
to
go
wrong...
...for
that
laser
to
fail
us
What
do
you
want
from
us?
I
want
you
to
tell
me
Two
deaths?
Okay,
all
right.
Three?
That's
a
pattern.
Now...
...I
know
you
two
didn't
do
this.
All
right?
But
I
think
you
know
something.
What
is
it?
We
don't
know
anything.
Take
a
guess.
We
think
we
weren't
supposed
to
survive
What?
And
new
something
"Something"?
That's
all
you
got?
SAM:
But
if
you
came
up
Thank
you.
"Something"
Hey.
Been
up
long?
Uh,
I
don't
know.
I
couldn't
sleep.
Sam,
you
can't
do
this
to
yourself.
No.
No,
no,
no.
I
was
thinking
about,
...we
all
get
off
the
bus,
Then
the
bus
tipped
over.
And
Isaac,
he
never
get
off
the
bus.
What
are
you
getting
at?
I
know
that
there
was
just
Lack,
I
know
that
I
helped
you
across.
Then
I
reached
back
for
Olivia.
But
she
didn't
make
it.
She
fell.
So
first
was
Candice.

Then
Isaac.
Then
Olivia.

They're
dying
in
order.
Who
dies
after
Olivia?

NATHAN
:
Roy,
would
you
come
MAN:
Uh-ch,
Roy,
that's
the

ROY:
Okay,

NATHAN:
What
is
with
your
timecard?
You
cut
my
hours,
I
cut
everyone's
hours,
okay?

us
operating
at

than
My

-My

ain't

at
50

My
ex-wife,
she's
taking
50
percent,
No,
we
gotta
move,
man.
ROY:
Hey,
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
Hey!
We
gotta
move
now!

NATHAN:
-Hey,
Dennis?
They're
closing
us
down.
They're
shutting
down
the
plant?
Not
the
plant,
just
us.
Can
you
believe
it?
Us?
It's
the
factory
guys
Not
us,
we're
supposed
to
be
safe.
Yeah,
Dennis,
we
get
bigger
problems.
Olivia
and
Isaac
are
dead.
Who's
Isaac?
Isaac
Palmer,
tech
support.
Wasn't
he
dead
already?
No,
Dennis.
Listen,
it's
going
to
happen
to
us
too
Yeah,
I
understand.
No.
No,
guilt
doesn't
kill
you.
Obviously,
you've
never
met
my
in-laws.
I'm
not
fucking
around
here,
Dennis.
Anyone
could
be
next.
It
could
be
you.
Understand?
Nobody's
safe.
What
are
you
talking
about?
We
weren't
supposed
to
survive
And
so
new
it's
kill
or
be
killed.
You
get
that,
Dennis?
Whatever.
I
warned
you.

I
will.
Hey,
Agent
Black,
it's
Dennis.
Um--
Listen,
Pete
just
came
in
here
He's
yelling
about
"kill
or
be
killed."
Oh,
yeah,
What
happened?
NATHAN:
I
don't
know.
I
don't
know.
-Nathan.
Are
you
okay?
-We
heard,
and
we
thought--
Did
you
kill
him?
What?
No.
No,
I
just--
It
was
just
timing,
you
know?
No,
you
did,
didn't
you?
You
saw
it
coming,
and
then
you
tack
No,
I
didn't
really
do
anything.
-Tell
us
the
truth:
Did
you
or
didn't
you?
Did
you
or
didn't
you?
Did
you
or
didn't
you?
Yes.
I
think
I
did.
I
killed
him.
So
if
the
theory
works,
He
should
have
your
death,
How
do
we
know
for
sure?
I
think
there's
an
order
to
these
deaths.
They
mirror
the
order
everyone
died
in
Then
who
would
be
next?
Who
wants
to
be
first
to
tell
me
Who
is
it,
Sam?
Who's
what?

Dennis!
It
was
Dennis.
No
shit.
MAN:
Why
are
you
fighting
me
on
this?
You're
not
seriously
going
to
work,
Molly,
Isaac
died
on
a
massage
table.
If
Death
is
gonna
came
for
me,
You
have
to
do
something.
-What,
kill
someone
so
I
can
live?
We'll
just
have
to
I
have
figured
it
out.
Something
saved
me
on
that
bridge.
Maybe
it
doesn't
want
me
to
die.
Maybe.
We
can't
live
our
lives
in
fear,
Moll.
So
if
it
happens
tomorrow,
As
long
as
we're
together...
...I'll
be
okay.
Right?
Why
don't
you
came
by
...and
I'll
make
you
All
right,
give
me
this.

I
mean.
I'm
next
to
go,
right?
It's
me
and
then
you,
isn't
it?
Anyways,
uh,
I
was
up
all
last
night,
...thinking
about
if
I
could
really
do
it.
-Do
what?
If
I
could
actually
kill
some
stranger,
And
I
thought
about
it.
And
I
convinced
myself
that...
...yeah,
I
could.
So
I
went
on
a
walk.
You
know,
nowhere
in
particular...
...but
every
couple
of
minutes,
Heh.
Like
clockwork.
I
could
just
grab
somebody
Or
just
shave
somebody
off
a
curb
You
know?
It'd
be
real
easy.
Peter,
what
did
you
do?
-Did
you...?
I
couldn't.
I
realized
that...
...I
couldn't
kill
somebody
And
I
thought
about
Candice,
Candice
didn't
deserve
to
die.
Olivia
didn't.
Dennis
didn't.
I
don't."
Do
I?
No,
of
course
you
don't.
Well...
...none
of
us
deserve
to
die,
...that
you
deserve
to
live,
Molly?
You
said
it
yourself...
...you
don't.

Go!
Repeat,
shots
fired.
Hide
and
I'll
distract
him.
PETER:
Where
is
she?
-Where
is
she?!
You're
gonna
have
to
kill
me
first.
Well,
that
doesn't
do
me
any
good.
Death's
after
you
too.
This
is
crazy,
Peter.
Don't
do
this.
Just
think
for
a
minute,
all
right?
You
are
not
a
killer.
I
don't
wanna
kill
anybody,
Sam.
I
don't
wanna
die
yet
either.

Heh.
it's
not
your
time
yet.
Don't
worry,
Molly...
...I
didn't
kill
him.
But
I
didn't
need
to,
Molly...
...because
Death
Doesn't
mean
I
can't
help
it.
That's
it.
