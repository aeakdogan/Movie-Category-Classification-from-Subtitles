twin.
Are

onto
it.
Now
swing
back

Okay.
CYBIL:
Yeah.
What
the
hell
You're
gonna
get
I
think
I
just
saw
She
was
the
one
What
are
you
talking
about?
She
was
the
one
Alessa.
We
don't
say
her
name.
That's
the
seal,
The
symbol
of
your
faith?
Something
terrible
We
have
to
leave.
The
darkness
is
coming!
Let's
go.
CYBIL:
ANNA:
Run.
Run!
Rose!


Hurry!
Rose.
Come!

Cybil!
DAHLIA:
You
run
not
towards
Do
not
join
the
others!
They
are
deceivers.
We
gotta
get
inside.
They
are
wolves
They
brought
about
They'll
take
you
Filth
and
lies!
Hey!
CYBIL:
Please.
I've
seen
Alessa.
It's
coming!
She's
dead,
Fire
doesn't
cleanse.
Listen
to
me.
Rose,
hurry!
She
looks
exactly
like
Sharon.
She
brought
us
here,
Why?
What
does
she
want?
Evil
wakes
in
vengeance.
Be
careful
what
you
choose.



CYBIL:




Oh,
God,
no.
Witches!
Destroy
the
witches!

No.
No.
No.
No,
we're
lost.

CHRISTABELLA:


Please,
Christabella,
They
gave
her
Eleanor,
you
must
remember
She
went
alone
outside
She
was
not
the
responsibility
We'll
deal
with
them
later.
Now
we
must
pray.


CHRISTABELLA:
from
whose
presence
And
no
home
was
left
to
them.
ALL:
from
whose
presence
And
no
home
was
left
to
them.
CHRISTABELLA:
And
I
saw
the
and
they
were
judged
ALL:
the
great
and
the
small,
and
they
were
judged
And
anyone's
name
not
found
they
will
be
thrown

NUN
AND
GIRLS:
I
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
keep.
If
I
should
die
before
I
wake,
I
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
take.
Amen.
All
right,
girls,
into
bed.
No
better
place
to
be
In
you
go,
Lindsey,
You've
got
your
bear,
No.
No
talking

Good
night,
children.
And
God
bless.
I'm
sorry,
Sister
Margaret,
I
can't
imagine
why.
Nine
years
ago,
a
baby
was
left
outside
My
wife
and
I
were
the
ones
I'm
very
happy
for
you,
but
I
can't
give
out
Look.
That
girl,
she
looks
exactly
I
can't
help
you,
I'm
sorry.
She
must
be
40
now.
Where
can
I
find
her?
This
story
isn't
hers
alone,
but
all
of
ours.
GUCCI:
You
know
what
you
got
now,
How
'bout
breakin'
And
by
the
looks
of
this,
Thank
you,
Thomas.
This
can't
go
It
won't,
Sister.
You
know,
who,
uh,
cover
their
tracks
What's
this?
Look,
Gucci,
Is
that
my
daughter's
Huh?
Look,
turn
around.
What
are
you
doing?

GUCCI:
I
did.
I
was
told
she
didn't
make
it
The
night
of
the
fire.
The
night
of
the
big
fire
There
were
these
people.
These
fanatics.
What
they
did
That
was
30
years
ago,
Not
as
far
as
I'm
concerned.
What's
it
gonna
be,
I--
I
can
put
you
in
jail,
or
you
can
go
home.
And
that's
your
definition
There
are
many
different
See,
you've
got
man's,
God's,
and
even
the
devil's.
Certain
forms
So
I
want
you
to
go
home
now
to
your
nice
warm
bed
and
let
me
deal
and
what
has
happened
Okay?
End
of
story.
CHRISTABELLA:
Honestly,
I
don't
know
Right
now,
I've
lost
is
that
I'm
supposed
Are
you
a
person
I
love
my
daughter.
That's
not
what
I
asked.
Who
are
you
to
judge?
We
judge
because
the
souls
Because
our
faith
Our
faith
keeps
Then
use
your
faith
Only
the
demon
knows
Then
tell
me,
No
one
has
ever
returned
where
the
demon
She's
not
gonna
help
us.
If
you
wish
to
face
the
demon
I
won't
stop
you.
Christabella,
Silence,
Adam.
Perhaps
your
faith
Perhaps
not.

If
you
don't
wanna
do
this...
I'll
understand.
Sharon's
adopted,
but
I'm
her
mother.
I
knew
that
from
the
moment
She's
lucky
to
have
you.
Mother
is
God


Quiet.
We're
in
his
domain
now.
Look
at
this
map.
Your
memory
may
save
Do
you
see
this
room?
ROSE:
That
is
where
The
demon
is
in
the
bowels
It
hides
behind
the
face
CYBIL:
Don't
believe
your
eyes.
Faith
is
the
only
truth.
I
will
pray
for
you,
Rose.
But
I
won't
expect
you
Goodbye.
Adam?

Right.
Left.
Left.
Right.
Right.
Left...
CHRISTABELLA:
ADAM:
In
the
basement?
ROSE:

ROSE:
Right.

Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Left.
Rose,
she's
killing
you.
Rose!
I
need
to
do
this.

MAN:
They'll
be
drawn
to
the
light,
but
you
won't
be
able
Thank
you.
So
this
thing
It
will.
If
the
demon
wants
you,
Forgive
me.
We've
lived
too
long
I
believe
this
is
yours.
Witch!
Her
child's
Her
child's
Go!
Go!
Don't
let
the
witches
Come
on!
Get
off
her!
Find
her.
No!
Wait!
Cybil!
Cybil!
Open
the
door!

Right,

Left,

I
can
do
this.


DARK
ALESSA:
You're
here.
You
did
it.
Your
reward
is
the
truth.
Did
you
see
that
Alessa
Even
though
nobody
KIDS
:
Their
parents
told
them
She
didn't
have
a
father

Alessa
was
alone
in
the
world.
You
know
what
can
happen
when
they're
left
alone.

DAHLIA:
It's
okay,
it's
me,
Even
her
mother
couldn't
help.
Even
though
she
loved
her
baby.
But
the
rest
of
the
family
They
were
just
like
the
others
We
know.
Your
daughter...
Why
you
won't
You've
brought
sin
amongst
us.
The
faithful
must
gather
for
we
are
called
What
does
she
mean,
Mommy?
You're
weak,
my
dear
sister.
Trust
us,
Dahlia.
We
will
restore
innocence.
DARK
ALESSA:
They
had
met
many
to
restore
innocence
They
had
a
special
place
Do
you
remember
the
hotel?
I
led
you
to
all
these
places,
and
you
were
very
good
CHRISTABELLA:
We
fight
the
sin,
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
You
know
how
that
feels,
To
lose
your
little
girl?
What
have
I
done?
Oh,
God.
CHRISTABELLA:
ALESSA
:
Once
again
we
are
locked
They
thought
they
knew
Praise
God
for
our
clarity.
ALL:
Praise
the
innocent
But
you
should
be
careful
CHRISTABELLA:
ALL:

And
our
unity.
ALL:
Your
weapons

Dahlia
:
No.
Now
you
know

She
tried
to
get
help,
DAHLIA
:
GUCCI:
Get
her
out,
boys.
There
were
good
people
People
like
you,
Rose.
People
who
like
to
help.
Alessa
was
so
lonely
They
should
have
known
better

When
you're
hurt
your
fear
and
pain
and
the
hate
starts
Alessa's
hate
grew
and
grew,

Her
hate
got
so
strong,
she
even
hurt
someone
That's
when
I
came.
I
told
her
it
was
their
turn.
I
promised.
They
would
all
fall

Now,
Rose,
we
must
talk.


DARK
ALESSA:
She
won't
hurt
you.
She
needs
your
help.
Who
is
she?
She
is
Alessa.
Then
who
are
you?
I
have
many
names.
Right
now,
Where's
my
child?
She's
not
your
child.
She's
hers.
The
little
girl
is
what's
left
We
hid
her
in
safety...
in
the
world


Now
the
dream
and
so
too
must
the
dreamers
For
over
30
years
they've
lied
For
30
years
they've
denied
But
now
is
the
end
of
days,
and
I
am
the
reaper.
What
do
you
want?
All
we
ask
for
is
satisfaction.
Satisfaction?
Revenge.
Why
me?
You
chose.
You
chose
Sharon.
Christabella
will
find
Sharon.
She
plans
to
purify
her.
Oh,
God,
no.
Their
blind
conviction
I
cannot
enter
but
you
can.
Just
tell
me
what
I
need
to
do.
Tell
them
the
truth.



DAHLIA:
Mine!
She's
mine!
She's
mine!
The
truth
is
clear
Just
as
I
could
see
GUCCI:
Out
of
the
car.
Just
a
friendly
warning:
I'll
be
back
with
people
Before
you
do
that,
I
wanna
tell
you
Few
years
back,
some
wacko,
Threw
him
down
a
mine
vent
Cybil
Bennett,
She
spent
three
days
keepin'
him
alive
We
know
what
we're
doin'.
I
need
to
do
everything
I
can.

CROWD
:
Burn
the
witch!
Please.
Your
weakness
led
This
time
you
will
bear
witness.
She
is
innocent.
Look
at
her.
She's
the
whelp
The
demon!
The
demon
fathered
from
her
child!
No,
she's
mine!
CYBIL:
Look
at
me.
Don't
be
afraid.
It's
okay,
it's
okay.
Your
mama's
coming.
CHRISTABELLA:
Once
again
we
are
We
burn
this
witch,
No.
You
can't,
you
can't.
Don't
let
her
say
this!
No!
We
burn
the
child!
We
fight
the
demon!

She's
just
a
child!
What
the
fuck
is
wrong
CYBIL:
Leave
her
alone!
Leave
her
alone!
Those
who
aid
the
demon,
they
must
be
cleansed
from
whence
they
came.
That's
crazy.
You're
crazy!
CYBIL:
Why
are
you
listening
to
this?
Why?
CROWD
:
Burn
the
witch.
Burn
her.
Sharon.
MAN:
Suffer.

CROWD
:
Burn
the
witch!
Burn
her!
Burn
her!
Burn
the
witch!

MAN:
CROWD
:
MAN:
Demon!
Burn
the
witch!
Burn
her!


You're
in
your
own
hell.

Mama,
be
with
me.


CHRISTABELLA:
Here
is
where
This
is
where
we
stop
We
drew
a
line
in
the
sand
"Demon,
you
will
not
cross!"
But
the
demon
is
wicked,
Yet
again
he
comes
to
tempt
us,
To
rid
the
world
of
this
demon

ROSE:
Mommy!
It's
okay,
baby.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
What
have
you
people
done?
CHRISTABELLA:
Yes,
I
have.
The
witch
has
returned.
CROWD:
Do
not
believe
her
lies.
I
come
from
a
world
I
come
from
a
world
Why
don't
you
tell
them
Tell
them
the
truth
There
was
no
apocalypse!
You
burned
in
the
fire
And
nothing
can
save
you
SHARON:
Take
her!
Burn
her.
Burn
her!
Burn
her!
MAN
2:
Burn
me?
That's
your
answer?
Burn
anything
Burn
anything
This
woman
uses
your
fear
She
led
you
She
led
you
to
burn
But
you
will
not
deny
your
guilt
That
child
was
sin
incarnate.
No.
You
darkened
the
heart
And
now
you
cower
in
the
face
Heresy.
Burn
her.
Burn
her!

Your
faith
brings
death!
You
are
alone
in
this
limbo.
And
God
is
not
here.
SHARON:

She
was
a
blasphemer.
CROWD:
Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!








What
have
you
done?
You've
brought
the
darkness
Do
you
know
For
Sharon.
Mommy.
Mommy.





SHARON:

Oh,
Lord,
give
me





No,
no.

Alessa,
what
have
you
become?


Mommy!
Sharon!
Sharon,
honey,

Down!
We're
getting
down.
Shut
your
eyes.
Shut
your
eyes.
Shut
your
eyes.
It's
just
a
bad
dream.

Why
did
she
not
take
me
ROSE:
Mother
is
God
I
love
you.



CHRISTOPHER
:
ROSE:
SHARON:
ALL:

Christopher,
it's
me.
I'm
with
Sharon.

Hello?
Hello?
Rose?
Rose?
And
we're
coming
home.
