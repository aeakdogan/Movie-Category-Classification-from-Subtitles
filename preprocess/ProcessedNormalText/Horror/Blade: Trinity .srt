In
the
movies,
Dracula
wears
a
cape,
and
some
old
English
guy
at
the
last
minute
But
everybody
knows
The
truth
is
it
started
with
Blade,
The
rest
of
us
What's
this
chicken
scratch?
It's
cuneiform.
It's
about
4,000
years
old.
So
why
here?
Because
this
is
the
cradle
of
civilization.
He
would've
been
comfortable
here.
I
don't
know,
Dan.
There's
something
beneath
us.
You
find
a
watch?
Is
it
a
body?
Guys?
Aah!
Go!
Aah!
What
the
fuck?!
Aah!
Tonight,
Dr.
Edgar
Vance,
and
author
of
the
New
York
Times
The
Whole
Being
Breakthrough.
Also
with
us,
Martin
Vreede,
They'll
be
here
for
the
next
hour,
next
on
Bently
Tittle
Live.
Okay,
Dr.
Vance.
You
are
a
psychiatrist
Yes,
Bently.
I
am
both.
And
it's
for
a
reason.
I
have
always
believed
if
we
reconcile
And
of
course,
we
have
to
get
rid
Okay.
And...
how's
that
In
the
case
of
vampires,
are
the
repositories
of
some
-
Okay.
-
Yeah.
-
Sexual?
These
are
very
scary
subjects
and
they're
right
inside.
So
what
you're
saying
is
-
You
bet
we
do.
Well,
for
instance,
I
talk
about
it
in
my
book.
And
the
symptoms
of
this
disease
are
remarkably
similar
The
people
who
suffer
they
become
intolerant
to
sunlight,
Garlic?
What's
your
take
on
all
these
rumors
Vampires,
vampires.
What?
The
only
vampires
I'm
worried
about
Seriously,
though.
If
vampires
existed,
don't
you
think
The
truth
is
our
streets
Homicide,
assaults,
violent
crime
If
people
want
to
be
concerned,
they
should
focus
in
on
characters
Now,
that's
the
guy
I
wanna
hear
about.
I
wanna
hear
about
this
character
Blade.
He's
a
sociopath
Blade
is
a
troubled
individual.
I
understand
that
he
is
that
there
is
a
vast
conspiracy
Now,
you've
got
to
look
of
a
belief
like
that.
Odds
are
he
believes
-
But
what
he's
really
doing...
...is
trying
to
kill
Aah!
Aah!
Ah!
Aah!
I'm
on
the
Stonebridge
overpass.
Got
it.
Heading
westbound.
I'm
just
beneath
ya.
Go!
Aah!
Aah!
Come
on!
I
got
him.
Pull!
You
all
right,
man?
He's
got
a
gun!
Oh,
my
God!
Ouch.
Staked
you
with
silver.
Why
aren't
you
ash?
Why
aren't
you
smarter?
Not
a
vampire,
dumb
shit!
Set
your
sorry
ass
up.
Damn.
Oh,
Blade.
What
the
fuck
happen
tonight?
How
should
I
know?
He
was
human.
You're
gettin'
reckless,
Blade.
Killing
vampires
is
clean.
They
ash...
don't
leave
Killing
humans
is
messy.
You
better
hope
nobody
ID'd
you.
This
worked
really
good.
What's
this?
A
new
delivery
system
for
your
serum.
It's
an
effervescent
inhaler.
Just
bite
down
on
the
mouth
guard.
Delivery's
automatic.
Some
friends
of
mine
made
it.
Friends?
Yeah.
It
was
horrible.
The
one
car
crashed,
and
then
the
guy
-
It
looked
like
there
was
a
lot
of
blood.
That
was
just
a
taste
during
tonight's
brazen
shootout
that
left
at
least
four
people
dead.
Now,
apparently,
an
anonymous
citizen
captured
the
whole
event
on
video.
Hey,
Ray.
Let's
catch
a
plane,
Wilson.
It's
time
to
take
these
cowboys
down.
That's
what
I'm
talkin'
about.
What's
he
been
doing?
Fuck
all.
Just
feeding.
Been
through
five
of
them
so
far.
Do
you
think
we
have
enough
security?
We
didn't
capture
him.
You
understand?
I'm
gonna
go
in.
You
shouldn't
have
woken
me.
We
had
to.
Your
blood,
your
sacrament,
What
makes
you
think
I
care?
Your
people
need
you.
My
people?
You're
nothing
but
shadows
Look
how
far
you
have
fallen.
The
world's
changed
since
your
time.
The
humans
have
a
new
hunter.
Blade.
And
you'd
like
me
Yes.
Subject
is
heading
west.
Got
him.
Congratulations.
Somebody
nailed
us.
Your
face
is
all
over
the
papers
Media's
eatin'
it
up.
-
Like
I
care.
Something
like
this...
as
far
as
the
rest
you're
public
enemy
number
one.
Didn't
know
this
was
Damn
it,
Blade.
They're
waging
Now
it's
not
just
vampires
we're
gonna
have
to
take
on
You
worry
too
much,
old
man.
That's
why
we're
still
alive,
goddamn
it.
I've
been
doing
this
You're
like
a
son
to
me.
I'm
sorry
I
got
old
on
ya.
I
see
you
alone,
And
it
breaks
my
heart.
We
can't
win
this
war
alone.
Look,
he
just
gave
me
the
evil
eye.
What
about
that
guy?!
Bro
and
prostitute,
baby.
So
what?
Quit
fucking
around.
I'm
hungry,
How
about
him?
No
fatties.
No,
I
like
him.
Wait...
what
about
that?
They
fucking
saw
us
over
there.
Fucking
blow
me,
man!
Oh,
got
it!
Got
it!
Baby
on
board.
Oh!
Looks
like
we
got
ourselves
Chicky,
chicky,
chicky,
chicky,
chicky!
Oh,
yeah,
baby!
What's
for
dinner?
Aah!
Hey,
pretty
lady.
No!
No!
No!
Scream
if
this
hurts,
chica.
Aah!
Fuck
you?
Aah!
Garlic!
Scream
if
this
hurts,
chica.
Aah!
What
is
it?
What
you
were
worried
about.
Let's
go,
let's
go,
let's
go!
Shoot
to
kill!
Aah!
Move
a
finger
and
you're
dead.
How's
about
this
one?
He's
got
something
in
his
hand!
Get
out,
Blade!
Shit!
What's
going
on
in
there?
Somebody
talk
to
me!
Aah!
Hold
it
right
there!
Don't
shoot,
don't
shoot.
Rise
and
shine,
sleepyhead.
Special
Agents
Ray
Cumberland,
-
We've
been
tracking
you
a
long
time.
Whistler.
Dead.
Just
like
all
your
victims.
Say,
how
many
people
Thirty?
Forty?
Fifty?
1,182.
But
they
were
all
familiars.
People
who
work
with
them.
Oh.
And
by
"them,"
Say,
so
how
do
you
kill
Maybe
you
could
give
us
a
few
pointers.
What
about
sunlight?
I
mean,
What
about
crosses?
Do
they
still
work,
Wilson,
I
don't
know,
Ray.
I
mean,
what
if
That's
a
good
point.
What
about
garlic?
Or
do
you
need,
like,
saffron
-
That
was
quick.
You
can
keep
doing
your
song
It's
not
gonna
play.
We
know
what
you
are.
You're
a
stone-cold
killer.
And
you're
sick
as
fuck.
Let's
leave
the
diagnosis
Hello,
Blade.
My
name
is
Dr.
Vance.
I've
been
charged
with
giving
you
Gentlemen,
would
you
mind
giving
us
He's
all
yours.
I
know
you
must
find
this
...but
I
want
you
to
know
And
in
order
for
me
to
do
that,
I'm
gonna
have
to
ask
you
You
know,
Blade...
I
was
signing
in
at
security,
Do
you
know
what
day
it
is?
How
about
the
President?
Who's
in
the
White
House
right
now?
An
asshole.
I
think
somebody
here
Vampires.
For
everyone
else,
I
had
a
set
of
wax
teeth
It
was
fun.
I
could
be
somebody
else.
But
I
want
to
hear
you
What
can
you
tell
me
about
them?
They
exist.
Are
you
one
of
them?
Sometimes...
...is
the
one
in
the
mirror.
Tell
me
about
blood.
When
you
drink
blood,
do
you
ever
feel
sexually
aroused?
Just
strikes
me
has
a
very
strong
element
Nuzzling
into
someone's
neck.
A
nocturnal
visit.
It
promises
a...
The
very
sweet
taste
of
saliva...
mixed
with
skin.
Sounds
good
to
me.
Where's
it
come
from?
That's
what
I
wanna
know.
And
I'm
starting
to
wonder
what
your
Were
the
two
of
you
very
close?
He's
psychotic.
No
shit.
For
his
safety
and
for
the
public's,
I'm
recommending
that
he
be
transferred
Fuck
that!
He's
wanted
in
connection
Hold
on,
gentlemen.
You
got
a
problem
with
that,
-
That
man
is
my
prisoner!
Don't
fuck
with
my
thing!
There's
a
team
from
the
hospital
You're
supposed
to
be
Not
this
time.
This
is
just
a
little
something
The
usual
dose
for
this
sort
of
thing
but
I
think
with
a
big,
I'll
kick
it
up
to
a
couple
thousand.
You
don't
have
a
problem
There.
That
wasn't
so
bad,
was
it?
Ooh,
you're
weak.
In
need
of
your
serum.
That
must
be
a
bad
feeling.
I
mean,
who
would've
imagined
that
a
mere
human
like
me
You're
one
of
them.
A
familiar.
Going
on
five
years
now.
It's
the
endgame,
Blade.
All
their
plans
are
coming
to
fruition.
Why
don't
you
just
sit
back
I
hate
familiars.
It's
why
we're
still
alive,
goddamn
it.
You're
like
a
son
to
me.
Sorry
I
got
old
on
ya.
I
see
you
alone,
It
breaks
my
heart.
Hi,
Blade.
So
glad
to
finally
meet
you.
I
am
such
a
fan.
I
like
your
tattoos.
Do
they
mean
anything?
Stupid.
Are
you
okay?
Are
you
tired?
You're
weak.
We
moved
the
humans
around.
Like
pawns.
We
used
them...
...to
flush
you
out.
You're
not
so
big.
You're
all
alone,
Blade.
No
one's
gonna
help
you
now.
-
Evening,
ladies.
Wake
up,
Blade.
Go!
Freeze!
Whistler!
This
way!
Blade!
You're
dead!
Get
down!
Blade.
Hey,
hey.
Where
are
you
going?
Where
the
fuck
is
he
going?
This
is
supposed
to
be
a
rescue!
Get
back,
get
back!
We're
pinned
down.
I
can't
shoot
around
corners.
I
can.
Aah!
Okay.
We're
fucked.
We're
fine.
Forgot
my
sword.
Whoo!
Come
on!
Abby.
Aah!
We
got
him.
We'll
be
there
soon.
Who
the
hell
are
you
people?
Well,
my
name
is
Hannibal
King.
And
this
little
hellion
Whistler's
daughter.
I
thought
the
vampires
They
did.
When
I
came
of
age,
and
I
told
him
I
wanted
in.
Been
doing
it
ever
since.
Welcome
to
the
honeycomb
hideout.
How
do
you
bankroll
this
operation?
I
date
a
lot
of
older
men.
Come
on,
man,
I'm
joking.
You
met
Dex.
This
is
Hedges.
Sommerfield...
she's
the
one
who
built
That
runt
you
saw
earlier,
We
call
ourselves
the
Nightstalkers.
Hmm.
Sounds
like
rejects
We
were
gonna
go
with
How
many
of
you
are
there?
There's
enough.
We
operate
in
sleeper
cells.
When
one
goes
down,
another
cell
Consider
us
your
reinforcements.
What,
you
amateurs
You?
Look
at
you.
You're
kids.
You're
not
ready
to
roll
with
this.
I
mean,
look
at
the
way
you're
dressed.
What,
that's
supposed
to
be
tactical?
What
is
this?
What
is
that?
It's
a
joke,
huh?
What
the
fuck
is
wrong
with
y'all?
You
think
this
is
a
fucking
sitcom?
Okay,
first
off,
that's
just
rude.
Second,
I'm
pretty
sure
I'm
impressed.
Look,
Blade,
my
father
meant
Like
it
or
not,
we
are
all
you
got.
What
the
hell
makes
you
think
Well,
here's
for
starters.
I
used
to
be
one.
Do
I
pass
the
audition?
Rookies.
Fucking
Hannibal
King!
I
should've
ripped
his
bleeding
heart
Ugh!
Ugh!
We
had
Blade.
We
had
him!
Ugh!
And
don't
tell
me
"I
told
you
so,"
Asher.
What's
wrong,
half
pint?
Blow
me.
We
got
caught
with
our
pants
down.
Pants
down?
They
pretty
much
Oh,
you
loved
it.
Has
he
been
told?
About
your
failure?
Yes.
Maybe
it's
time
I
joined
the
game.
You
know
the
kind
of
woman
You
see
her
and
every
warning
bell
but
you
still
manage
to
ask
Well,
that's
all
I
ever
hook
up
with.
But
this
betty...
Whoa!
She
blew
'em
all
away
Her
name
is
Danica
Talos.
You
met
her
earlier.
And
unlike
typical
vampires,
Moving
on.
The
man
on
her
left
and
this
walking
diaper
stain
I
picked
Danica
up
in
a
bar
and
spent
the
next
five
years
as
her
little
vampire
cabana
boy.
Eventually,
Abigail
found
me.
Sommerfield
managed
to
treat
me
And
that's
basically
We
need
to
pool
our
resources,
Blade.
"We"?
Yeah,
we.
He's
come
back.
Take
a
look
at
this.
You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
Where'd
you
guys
I
stole
most
of
it.
You
got
stonework,
ironwork,
It's
this
stuff
that
shows
up
everywhere.
It's
on
everything
in
here.
He
is
real.
all
the
layers
of
bullshit
that
have
cluttered
and
eventually
So
the
movies
are
true.
The
movies
are
just
a
comforting
Bram
Stoker...
he
wrote
a
good
yarn,
but
the
events
that
he
described
God.
That
was
just
a
tiny
piece
The
real
Dracula...
his
origins
How
early?
Try
six
or
seven
thousand
years.
This
is
a
piece
of
his
armor.
With
it,
we
were
able
to
extrapolate
a
Check
this
out.
Dracula's
only
one
The
Babylonians
worshipped
him
If
you
believe
in
the
legends,
Nobody
really
knows
the
specifics
He
was
the
first
of
his
kind.
The
patriarch
of
hominus
nocturna.
He
was
born
perfect.
And
just
like
the
great
white
shark,
Forget
the
movies,
forget
the
books.
There's
no
happy
ending
with
this
guy.
He's
been
there,
cutting
a
bloody
fucking
path
...just
like
that...
...he
up
and
disappeared.
And
then
we
heard
a
rumor.
The
vampires
were
searching
for
him.
Some
say
he'd
been
sleeping
that
he'd
retreated
from
a
world
And
according
to
our
information,
they
And
he
was
pissed.
Don't
try
to
use
my
name,
Tried
to
claim
my
fame,
About
to
raise
the
pain,
Tried
to
claim
my
fame,
About
to
raise
the
pain,
Bite
through
your
jugular
vein,
In
the
window...
You
sell
vampire
merchandise?
Uh,
yeah.
Look
around.
We
might
have
a
few
things.
We've
got
Dracula
lunchboxes.
Did
you
see
those?
There's
bobble
heads,
key
chains.
This
is
funny.
That
garlic
gets
me
every
time.
We've
got
just
about
anything.
Even
vampire
vibrators.
Here.
Check
this
out.
Dra-cola.
Makes
you
want
to
cry,
doesn't
it?
Was
there
something
special
Hey,
guy.
She's
talkin'
to
ya.
What?
You
wanna
kiss
me,
pretty
boy?
Aah!
No!
Tried
to
claim
my
fame,
About
to
raise
the
pain,
Bite
through
your
jugular
vein,
Aah!
Aah!
Bite
through
your
jugular
vein,
Why
wake
up
Drake
now?
That's
exactly
what
we've
been
When
I
was
under
the
fang,
there
used
to
be
talk
about
But
I
could
never
figure
out
why
I
mean,
that
makes
no
sense,
right?
They've
always
had
plans
and
it
seems
likely
Drake's
return
is
part
of
it.
Let's
face
it.
We
are
fighting
a
losing
battle
here.
So
we
kill
a
few
hundred
There
are
thousands
of
them
out
there,
We
need
a
new
tactic.
Like
what?
A
biological
weapon.
For
you
sighted
people...
...here's
a
little
show
and
tell.
For
the
last
year,
in
order
to
create
an
artificial
virus
We're
calling
it
DayStar.
Think
about
it,
Blade.
We
could
wipe
'em
all
out
So
what's
been
holding
you
back?
The
lethality
in
vampires
is
still
spotty.
The
bottom
line
is
we
need
We
need
Dracula's
blood.
Because
Dracula
is
the
progenitor
his
DNA
is
still
pure.
It
hasn't
been
diluted
by
a
hundred
We
get
his
blood,
we
can
boost
All
the
vampires
go
bye-bye.
So,
can
we
just
for
one
of
our
secret
Oh.
Holy
shit.
Um,
gentlemen
and
hottie,
uh,
we
have
a
