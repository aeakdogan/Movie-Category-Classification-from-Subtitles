say
hello
Dr.
Dutton...
My
aunt
is
in
town.
-
And
she's
sick

You
know...
You
should
probably
text
your
"aunt"
Scotty
and
tell
him
Oh,
wait
a
second...How...
Oh,
c'mon
Becky.
-
I
mean...
Now,

saying
a
lot!

the
best
time.
Son...
Settle

Hey
Curt...I'm
so
sorry.
I
liked
Rory...
-
What
he
was
doing
out
there?
-
That's
all.
You
know
how
proud
he
was
of
that.
Is
that
what
you
are
saying?
-
Is
that
what
you
are
telling
people?
You
had
to
do
it?
You
did
the
right
thing.

is
the
exception.

Shit
sounded
like
a
plane
truck.

Shit.
Big
plane?
Little
