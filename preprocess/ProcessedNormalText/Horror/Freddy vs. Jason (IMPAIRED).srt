Freddy
Krueger:
From
the
very
beginning...
It
was
the
children
The
Springwood
slasher...
That's
what
they
called
me.


My
reign
of
terror
Dozens
of
children

Then
the
parents
of
Springwood
Taking
justice
When
I
was
alive,
I
might
But
after
they
killed
me,
I
became
something
much,
the
stuff
nightmares
The
children
and
their
fear
gave
me
the
power
And
that's
when
the
fun
Aah!
Until
they
figured
out
To
erase
me
completely!
Being
dead
wasn't
a
problem.
But
being
forgotten--
Aah!
It's
only
a
dream!
Die,
motherfucker!
Freddy:
I
can't
come
back
I
can't
come
back...
If
nobody's
afraid!
I
had
to
search
the
bowels
But
I
found
someone...
Someone
He
may
get
the
blood,
And
that
fear
Mike?
Is
that
you?
All
right,
I'm
heading
in.

Come
on,
Ohh-aaah-aaah,
Aah!
