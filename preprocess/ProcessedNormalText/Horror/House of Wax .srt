Hello,
Matthew,
I
came
to
get
the
books.
We've
been
doing
very
well
lately.
Over
200
paid
admissions
today.
You
call
that
good
Saturday
business?
If
you
weren't
so
stubborn,
Who
cares
a
hang
about
history
in
wax?
There
are
people
in
the
world
But
more
who
want
sensation,
shock!
Morbidly
curious!
I
won't
cater
to
them.
Their
money
is
as
good
as
anybody
else's.
You
should
have
seen
them
turning
on
23rd
Street
tonight:
the
Eden
Muse.
The
story's
the
same
at
-If
you'd
only
listened
to
me--
I'd
put
in
a
Chamber
of
Horrors:
scare
the
life
out
of
people.
You're
a
great
artist,
a
genius
sculptor.
I'm
an
ordinary
businessman
who
wants
I've
put
$20,000
-I
could
use
that
to
better
advantage.
I've
known
for
some
time
-I
may
be
able
to
accommodate
you.
A
friend
is
bringing
Sidney
Wallace,
Wallace
is
rich,
and
I
think
That
sounds
interesting.
-I'll
want
a
profit
on
my
investment.
I
understand.
You
leave
everything
to
me,
-That
should
be
they,
now.
I've
heard
of
Wallace.
If
he
likes
your
stuff,
put
a
stiff
price
on
it.
-Does
Jarrod
live
here?
You'll
like
him,
Sidney.
Please
come
in.
I
thought
you
wouldn't
come
We
were
delayed.
Mr.
Sidney
Wallace.
Professor
Jarrod.
-A
pleasure.
That
title
was
bestowed
on
me
It
has
little
to
do
with
my
real
work.
If
you
come,
I
will
show
you
The
visit
of
such
a
distinguished
critic...
may
cause
my
children
To
you,
they're
wax.
But
to
me,
Here
we
have
two
great
lovers
Cleopatra,
Queen
of
Egypt,
You'll
recall,
Antony,
killed
himself
with
his
own
sword.
When
Cleopatra
found
out
what
happened,
You
noticed
how
cleverly
Yes.
How
do
you
do
that?
Real
hair
of
the
proper
color
and
texture...
is
pressed
into
the
slightly
warmed
wax
one
hair
at
a
time.
Each
wave
and
curl
Here's
President
Lincoln
and
his
assassin,
one
of
my
few
concessions
That's
the
best
figure
of
Booth
I've
ever
-I
wonder
what
he'd
say.
Even
after
he
shot
Lincoln
and
jumped
he
couldn't
resist
turning
to
the
audience
I
found
him
a
very
stubborn
person.
-Stubborn?
For
days
I
argued
with
this
fellow
-You
mean,
he
talked
back
to
you?
It's
not
easy
to
shut
an
actor's
mouth.
These
groups
are
like
This
is
not
only
a
great
show,
That's
what
I
told
you.
Here
we
have
Joan
of
Arc,
-I
understand
that.
It's
beautifully
done.
I've
done
her
over
a
dozen
times,
What
was
wrong
with
her?
There
are
no
so
sculptors
and
painters
I've
never
found
the
right
one,
It's
a
shame
to
race
through
this
exhibit.
You're
very
kind.
but
in
bringing
back
to
life
I
feel
I've
done
my
best
work.
I've
never
seen
anything
so
exquisite.
People
say
they
can
see
that
her
breast
rises
and
falls.
Look
at
her
eyes,
She
is
very
real
to
me.
You
know,
her
eyes
do
follow
you.
They're
made
of
glass,
more's
the
pity.
They're
inserted
into
the
sockets
by
way
of
the
hollow
neck,
Forgive
me,
my
dear,
I'm
sorry.
I
lose
myself
at
times.
If
people
knew
what
you
have
you
couldn't
accommodate
the
crowds.
What
you
need
here
is
exploitation,
-That's
what
I've
been
telling
him.
He's
not
happy
here.
Would
you
become
a
partner
I
might
be
interested
if
my
With
your
support,
I'd
do
wonders.
Unfortunately,
I'm
leaving
for
Egypt.
I'll
be
back
in
three
months,
You
make
me
very
happy.
You
intrigue
me,
Professor.
-Good
night.
-And
I'm
grateful
to
you--
Thank
you
for
your
visit
I'll
see
you
in
three
months.
-Good
night.
Mr.
Wallace
is
a
great
art
critic,
darling.
Does
he
make
you
happy?
Of
course
you'd
say
that.
The
world
will
acknowledge
your
beauty.
And
you,
my
friends...
Cleopatra,
Mark
Antony,
How
would
it
suit
you
to
be
famous
again?
I
know
it'll
please
you,
It
was
like
you
to
get
yourself
shot
down
Couldn't
do
it
Do
you
really
hear
what
they
say?
Of
course.
A
man
has
to
be
a
little
nuts
The
sooner
I'm
out
of
it,
the
better.
You'll
be
out
soon,
Matthew.
Mr.
Wallace
returns
from
Egypt
He'll
be
ready
to
talk
business
then.
-I
heard
him.
That's
no
good
for
me.
I
want
to
buy
something.
It'll
pay
off
What
guarantee
do
I
have
-Sorry.
It's
the
best
I
could
do.
How
would
you
like
And
you
call
me
crazy?
You
ever
thought
of
what
would
happen
In
the
cellar,
there
are
six
barrels
of
wax.
It's
highly
inflammable.
Burn?
Burn
all
my
people?
-Do
you
think
I'm
a
murderer?
These
dummies
are
insured
for
$25,000.
You'd
have
money
to
begin
again.
I'd
rather
die
myself
I
won't
let
you
do
it,
Don't
be
stupid.
All
you
have
to
do
is
to
strike
a
match
Yes,
my
friend
was
a
genius.
Only
I
could
understand
him.
We
were
like
that,
Cathy.
Just
like
that.
-Couldn't
they
ever
find
him
after
the
fire?
The
place
burned
like
a
paint
factory.
He
was
such
an
impractical
fellow.
But
I
still
loved
him.
Had
I
been
there,
I
might
have
saved
him.
You
might
have
gotten
burned
yourself.
Yes.
Such
is
life.
No
matter
how
much
we
lose,
Was
there
any
insurance
Yes.
I
had
a
little
difficulty
about
that.
According
to
the
partnership
agreement...
the
money
was
to
go
The
insurance
company
They
always
want
a
corpse.
But
they
settled
finally.
Certified
check.
I
got
it
cashed.
-You
know
what
that
means,
baby?
That
little
trip
You're
such
a
card!
-How
much
did
you
get?
Where
would
you
like
to
go?
Atlantic
City?
Niagara
Falls.
-License?
Legitimate.
Why
not?
It
might
be
fun.
Waiter,
my
check.
Pull
it
tighter,
Sue.
I
want
a
waist
like
Anna
Held.
If
I
pull
it
any
tighter,
That's
all
right.
As
my
late
friend
Matty
used
to
say:
"If
a
girl
don't
watch
her
figure,
Wasn't
that
the
man
you
were
to
marry?
Yes,
but
he
hung
himself
instead.
Matty
was
such
a
card.
Where
is
your
new
friend
The
Hoffman
House
for
dinner,
-That
sounds
like
fun.
Little
bit
older
than
I
like
'em,
-Is
he
nice?
A
real
gentleman,
That's
to
be
expected.
I'm
moving
up.
I'm
moving
up
in
the
world,
honey.
No
girl
ever
hits
the
jackpot
-Is
that
how
it
goes?
Look
at
me.
Not
too
long
ago,
And
tonight
I'll
be
right
up
there
Now,
when
you
get
up
there
tonight,
Don't
worry,
I
won't.
He
keeps
trying
to
pour
the
liquor
into
me,
After
all,
now
that
I'm
going
regular
I
got
social
obligations.
You
know
how
it
is
when
a
fella....
You're
not
like
me.
You
never
could
be.
You
got
all
the
brains
You
know,
I'm
surprised
What
nonsense.
Why
not?
A
girl
needs
a
friend
Holy
smoke!
Look
at
the
time.
Did
you
find
a
job
yet?
No,
but
they
need
a
hat-check
girl
and
I've
got
an
appointment
I
know
that
fellow.
Watch
out
for
him.
-But
why?
What's
the
matter
with
him?
-Long
as
you
know
how
to
duck.
Yes.
-Did
you
eat
today?
To
hear
you
tell
it.
-Besides,
you're
behind
in
your
room
rent.
Don't
count
on
that.
The
old
buzzard
There.
If
I
don't
sizzle
him
tonight,
He's
picking
me
up
in
a
hansom
cab.
All
I've
got
is
50
cents.
-No,
Cathy.
My
friend
will
give
me
some
money
I
don't
need
any
mad
money.
Good
luck
tonight
at
the
Silver
Slipper.
Just
a
moment,
Miss
Allen.
-What
are
you
coming
in
so
quietly
for?
-Did
you
get
the
job?
-Why
not?
You'll
get
your
money.
Cathy
promised
to
lend
me
some
tonight
You
better
get
right
up
there,
then.
-Couldn't
it
wait
until
tomorrow?
If
you
want
to
sleep
in
this
house
tonight,
All
right,
I'll
try.
Cathy,
it's
Sue.
Are
you
there?
I
tell
you,
the
scream
came
from
up
there.
Let's
look
into
it.
-Usually
there's
a
policeman
at
the
corner.
Cabbie!
-What
is
it,
Mother?
This
is
a
surprise.
-What
happened
to
you,
dear?
-Wait
a
minute.
-Wait
a
minute.
Cathy
Gray,
the
girl
in
my
rooming
house,
-What?
The
man
who
killed
her
I
tried
to
get
away
from
him.
But
he
followed
me
into
the
street.
No,
Scott,
please
don't
go
out
there.
It's
all
right,
darling.
Don't
be
frightened.
It's
all
right
now,
dear.
You're
safe.
-Who
found
the
body?
-Sue
Allen.
-She
isn't
here.
I
don't
know.
We
heard
her
scream.
When
we
went
looking
for
her,
-Are
all
your
roomers
in?
Lt.
Brennan
will
want
a
statement
See
that
nobody
leaves
the
house.
When
I
arrived
at
the
rooming
house,
The
immediate
cause
of
death
The
mark
of
a
cord
is
still
on
her
throat.
My
examination
indicated
-You
were
right.
Something
to
make
her
sleep.
I'll
know
as
soon
as
we
hear
How
long
would
it
take
That
would
depend
upon
It
was
probably
given
to
her
in
a
drink.
That's
how
it's
usually
done.
-Business
is
slow
tonight.
-Three
suicides
and
two
murders....
The
fellow
got
hit
by
an
automobile.
I
didn't
think
they
go
fast
enough
Give
them
time.
I
hope
you
like
it
here,
honey.
-What's
the
matter
with
this
one?
The
embalming
fluid
makes
them
jump.
One
of
the
suicides.
Just
like
a
woman.
They
always
have
to
have
the
last
word.
-Why
didn't
you
tell
the
police?
Last
night
was
the
time
to
do
it.
-She
was
in
no
condition
to
come
here.
The
body
of
Cathy
Gray
No.
Why
would
anyone
We
are
as
much
in
the
dark
as
you
are.
We
had
a
similar
case
before.
I
read
about
that.
And
Patterson,
We
found
no
trace
of
him.
We
could've
laid
our
hands
That's
the
strangest
description
-No
human
being
can
look
like
that.
I
did
see
him.
He
was
incredible,
but
very
real.
Could
he
be
the
man
That's
impossible.
She
told
me
That's
what
the
landlady
said,
We
have
no
suspects
If
we
did,
Don't
leave
town.
Where
can
we
find
you?
27
Lafayette
Street.
-Miss
Allen
will
stay
in
our
home.
That's
all.
Thank
you.
How
do
you
do?
I
received
a
letter
giving
this
address
But
I
know
the
Professor's
dead.
My
name
is
Sidney
Wallace.
It's
so
good....
Forgive
me.
Shaking
hands
with
me
My
hands
are
no
longer
hands.
This
is
Igor.
He's
a
deaf-mute.
I'm
going
to
open
another
wax
museum
-lt
startled
you,
seeing
me
here?
Jarrod
is
dead.
I
am
a
reincarnation.
When
I
saw
your
signature,
I
don't
understand
It's
a
mystery
to
me,
too.
All
I
can
remember
is
-I
failed
at
first,
but
here
I
am.
Somehow
I
made
my
way
I
still
have
my
limbs
but
As
for
my
hands,
As
a
sculptor,
I
can't
control
them.
-But
you're
beginning
again?
I'm
rebuilding
my
exhibition
I'm
going
to
give
the
people
sensation,
horror,
shock.
Send
them
out
in
the
streets
how
wonderful
it
is
to
be
scared
to
death.
I'll
show
you
one
of
my
subjects.
Do
you
recall
the
case
of
Kemmler,
-Yes.
He
has
a
strange
obsession,
Every
head
he
models
But
in
this
case
I
humor
him,
Crimes
of
violence
and
exhibited
while
they
are
still
fresh
What
do
you
think
of
my
scheme?
It
will
succeed,
commercially,
-Have
you
turned
your
back
on
beauty?
But
I
can
no
longer
create
it.
-I
never
forgot
your
Marie
Antoinette.
She
will
be
the
leading
lady
But
I
must
find
her
first.
-Find
her?
Yes,
there
will
be
beauty,
But
each
subject
must
be
taken
from
life.
How
can
I
convince
my
audience
I
have
something
I
think
will
interest
you.
You
follow
Igor
down
into
the
basement.
I
have
to
go
my
own
way.
Here
we
are.
Interesting,
isn't
it?
One
of
my
pupils
is
about
to
dip
a
body
-Body?
The
bodies
are
constructed
separately...
to
exact
specifications,
This
is
Leon,
another
one
of
my
pupils.
-Mr.
Wallace.
The
wax
is
melted
in
the
cauldron
liquefied
and
brought
to
a
boiling
point...
so
that
it
will
distribute
itself
The
head
and
hands,
are
attached
to
the
body
Now
watch.
I
wondered
how
it
was
done.
It's
a
method
of
my
own.
-Have
you
found
a
home
for
your
museum?
We'll
continue
to
use
the
cellar
it's
an
excellent
location,
and
the
building
I
have
some
capital,
but
I
need
more.
That's
why
I've
asked
you
to
come
here.
-I'll
think
it
over.
She
is
about
right,
now.
Leon,
drain
out
the
surplus,
Leon,
open
up
number
27.
Come
this
way,
please.
I
told
you
that
I
intend
to
exhibit
Here
is
an
interesting
subject.
A
mystery
they
are
still
talking
about.
All
right,
Leon.
I
saw
his
picture
in
the
papers.
-But
it
can't
be
a
death
mask.
He
hanged
himself
in
an
elevator
shaft.
Come
in,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
See
the
Chamber
of
Horrors.
Here's
three
lovely
ladies
right
over
here.
Would
you
like
to
see
Little
Egypt?
Here
she
is,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
who
danced
at
the
Colombian
Exposition
Is
she
wax,
or
is
she
flesh
and
blood?
See
the
world
in
wax,
the
Hall
of
Fame.
The
Chamber
Of
Horrors.
A
cultural
exhibition
-I
think
I
could
do
that.
I
could,
too,
if
I
took
my
stays
off.
Don't
do
that.
Don't
talk
that
way.
Watch
it,
young
lady.
Careful,
sir.
Keep
your
head
down
Look
out.
That's
a
becoming
hat
you're
wearing.
I
wonder
if
I
could
clip
a
flower
off
it.
Or
you'll
lose
the
powder
off
your
nose.
There
is
someone
with
a
bag
of
popcorn.
Close
your
mouth,
Not
your
tonsil.
Here
she
comes.
Look
at
that,
it's
in
the
bag.
See
the
lovely
centers
of
ancient
times,
Beauties

died
and
tortured

pass
the
time

day

Thrills,
chills,
a
lot
of
dirt
I
hope
you
don't
think
I've
gone
too
far
-He
makes
it
sound
like
a
sideshow.
Once
we're
established,
He
looks
like
a
real
man.
You'd
be
surprised.
It's
a
real
man.
Sorry.
The
historic
figures
I'm
about
to
show
you

I
tell
you

your
ancestor
During
the
French
Revolution...
a
certain
doctor
invented
to
take
the
place
of
a
headmen's
ax.
So
successful
was
this
machine...
at
cutting
off
the
heads
they
named
it
after
its
creator.
Here
it
is,
the
bloody
guillotine.
I
don't
think
I
can
stand
it.
Pull
yourself
together.
Twelve
years
ago,

Here
we
have
an
authentic
reproduction...
of
the
execution
of
William
Kemmler
Kemmler
killed
without
mercy
The
torture
of
the
rack.
In
this
case...
Lady
Anne
Askew,
an
English
noblewoman
is
being
put
to
the
question.
Needless
to
say,
Who
wouldn't,
-Is
it

Mine
turned
over,
too.
Now,
my
friends...
we
have
that
jolly
old
gentleman
Like
his
namesake,
and
did
away
with
eight
wives.
-Smelling
salts,
ladies?
Help
yourself.

a
mystery
Matthew
Burke,
the
stockbroker.
He
was
found
hanged
in
the
elevator
shaft
Was
it
murder
or
suicide?
Only
time
will
tell.
"Foul
deeds
will
rise,
though
all
the

Thank
you.
-You
like
him?
They
ought
to
have
a
policeman
like
this
-Haven't
you
been
there?
From
what
I
see
in
the
papers,
We'll
soon
find
out.
Meet
my
good
friend,
Mr.
Sidney
Wallace.
-Miss
Sue
Allen.
-I
heard
you
were
in
town.
I
expect
great
things
of
Scott.
-Has
he
been
working
hard?
-Sue's
been
posing
for
me.
She's
not
a
professional
model.
Our
mothers
were
great
friends.
-Have
you
been
inside?
If
anything,
too
much
so.
Jarrod,
the
owner,
You'll
be
interested
in
him.
-These
figures
are
excellent.
They're
not
only
well
done
-What
do
you
think?
but
they
seem
so
real,
Wait
till
you
see
the
Chamber
of
Horrors.
I
told
Jarrod
he
should
have
He
lost
the
use
of
his
hands.
-Who
did
these
figures?
-His
is
the
mastermind.
Sue,
what
is
it?
-Are
you
crying?
A
dear
friend
of
mine
was
murdered
She
means
Cathy
Gray,
the
girl
What
made
you
think
of
her
now?
That's
her
face.
I
know
every
line
of
it.
I
wake
up
at
night
and
I
see
it.
Perhaps
that's
the
reason
-It's
more
than
a
resemblance.
I
know,
but....
But
why
should
it
be
so
like
Cathy?
I
think
I
can
explain
that.
-This
is
a
pleasure.
I
heard
what
the
young
lady
said.
The
figure
of
Joan
of
Arc
It
was
completed
just
in
time
You're
right,
my
dear.
When
I
create
an
important
figure,
I
saw
pictures
of
your
Cathy
Gray
Her
face
fascinated
me.
And
here
she
is.
Immortalized
as
the
victim
-Do
you
really
think
she'd
mind?
Cathy
loved
to
"dress
up"
as
she
called
it.
and
imitate
the
actresses
-I
don't
think
she'd
mind.
There's
nothing
to
forgive.
I
just
don't
understand
That's
the
finest
compliment
Did
I
hear
your
name
correctly,
-Yes,
Mr.
Jarrod.
Sidney
showed
me
He
was
right.
You
have
great
promise.
-What
are
you
doing
now?
Let
me
see
your
hands.
Mine
were
once
like
that.
How
I
envy
you.
Would
you
be
interested
in
some
modeling
Yes.
I'd
be
honored.
Good.
Come
here
tomorrow
morning,
I
think
you'll
like
it.
I
want
you
to
look
at
this
girl.
-With
pleasure.
I've
been
wondering
about
that.
I
haven't
known
her
but
there's
something
about
her
face--
That
haunts
you
as
the
face
Of
course.
I
should
have
seen
it
at
once.
A
figure
in
wax.
More
than
wax.
She
lived.
-You
mean
I
look
like
she
did?
Once
in
his
lifetime,
and
creates
something
that
comes
alive.
So
it
was
with
my
Marie
Antoinette.
But
she
is
gone
now.
Horribly
destroyed.
Perhaps
you
would
help
me
You
will
come
to
see
me?
Soon?
I'd
be
glad
to.
You'll
be
welcome
at
any
time,
-And
you,
Mr.
Andrews,
in
the
morning....
It
has
been
a
very
exciting
day
for
me
So
if
you'll
forgive
me,
I'll
say
good
night.
-Sidney,
one
moment,
please.
Forget
about
it.
Cathy's
face
was
inspiration.
Why
should
it
seem
so
real?
I
hate
to
drag
you
away.
That's
fine.
I'm
going
to
work
here.
Yes,
another
time.
Still
time
to
see
the
entire
exhibition,
Get
your
tickets
from
the
fine
little
lady
See
the
world
in
wax
See
the
Chamber
of
Horrors
Not
again.
What
happened?
Why
did
you
scream?
I
saw
Cathy
again.
And
the
man
who
killed
her
I
must
have
been
dreaming.
Of
course
you
were,
dear.
A
lager
for
the
gentleman.
Sarsaparilla
for
the
lady.
-And
two
knockwurst
on
rye.
-Enjoying
yourself?
-Do
nice
people
come
here?
-These
Sunday
matinees
are
very
popular.
It
doesn't
seem
proper,
You
never
saw
a
show
Don't
worry,
your
reputation
is
safe.

figures
You
need
something
like
this
Prosit!
Remember
Mr.
Jarrod
said
he
first
saw
Yes.
What's
wrong
with
that?
I
knew
her
so
well.
I
knew
every
little
expression
They
would
be.
The
man's
an
artist.
There's
something
else
I
saw
Cathy
had
a
habit
She
had
the
lobe
of
her
right
ear
only
But
that's
there,
too.
-How
can
he
make
it
so
real
unless....
Unless
it
is
Cathy.
I'm
going
to
take
you
Tell
him
exactly
what
you
told

here.
He'll
convince
you
once
and

all
Now
relax,
honey,
and
enjoy
the
show.
I
know
it
sounds
fantastic,
You
can
see
this
idea
is
an
obsession,
-You
say
Jarrod
is
a
cripple?
He
can
walk
with
crutches,
Such
a
man
came
and
asked
to
see
That's
how
it's
done.
Every
detail
But
why
should
Joan

Arc
-Why
not?
They
wore
them
then.
Lieutenant,
it's
not
a
suspicion.
Intuition
isn't
much
help
in
police
work.
Suppose
you
forget
about
it,
You
mean
you'll
investigate
it?
-Of
course
he
does.
-You
both
think
I'm
crazy.
It
was
very
good
of
you
to
listen
-Goodbye.
Thanks.
This
is
Brennan
speaking.
Give
me
Shane.
Hello.
I
want
you
to
go
and
check
up
Yes,

opened
a
museum
Yes,
The
House
of
Wax.
Dig
up
all
you
can.
Get
a
list
That's
a
copy
of
her
face,
all
right.
But
she
didn't
look
like
that
-Not
so
composed.
You
know,
this
fellow
Jarrod's
good.
-You
think
Miss
Allen's
fears
are
justified?
That's
wax,
how
could
it
be
anything
else?
Leave
it
to
a
skirt
So
you
did
you
come
to
see
me,
Or
was
it
that
you
came
to
see?
Mr.
Jarrod,
I'm
so
sorry.
I
know
You
couldn't
help
yourself.
I
beg
your
pardon,
-How
do
you
do?
Leon

an
artist
in
his
own
right.
It
was
he
who
did
the
waxwork
-Does
she
still
seem
real
to
you?
Of
course,
her
hair
is
different,
What
puzzles
me
is
Was
Cathy
wearing
her
earrings
Earrings?
I
don't
remember.
No.
I
don't
think
so.
The
police
would
remove
the
jewelry

you
were
careful
to
show
that
Yes,

course.
If
I
missed
a
detail
of
that
sort,

insists
on
reality.
I
can
understand
that.
Just
a
moment,
Leon.
There's
something
in
this
box

Andrews
permitted

has
just
finished
it

It's

very
good

is
clever,
he
has
too
much
imagination.

I
need

Nothing
less

satisfy
me.
Will
you
come
to

me
again,
my
dear?
You
know
this
fellow
Jarrod's
That's
what
he
says
in
his
advertising.
Look
at
that.
Even
the
twist
in

That's
a

that
gets
me.
