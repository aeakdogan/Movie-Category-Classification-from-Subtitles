How

you
know
my

Good

and
a
half
I'd
look
after

myself,
I'm
awfully
sorry.



Good
morning.
I
wonder
if
you
I'm
looking
for
a
man
Do
you
know
him?
Where
does
he
live?
-
Yes,
I
know,
but
where?
Where?
Now,

you
see.
Well,

Where
would
I
get
a

Want
me
to
order

you?
What
name?
Okay.

I
wonder
if
you
-
The
little
girl's
name?
Yes.


-

Lois.

-

-
Are
you
sure?
I
need
her
exact
name.
Oh,
uh...
Just
hold
on
In
that
case,
Go
straight
through
town
Then
you
turn
right
there.

Near
the

you
have
a

Are
you
all
right?
What
made
it

seemed
to
swoop
down

do
you
know

We
went
to

Did
you?
Imagine
that.
The
weekend.

I
think
So
you
came
up
-
I
think
you
came
up
to
see
me.
I
don't
know,

must've
to

was
no

at

do
you
do,
Miss

So
I've
already
invited
her

Well,
you
did
go
to

You
did
say

Oh,
I
see.
So
we
couldn't
let
you
And
you
haven't
met

Well,
yes,
but...
Certainly,
but...

Maybe.
We'll
be
waiting
for
you.
Much
better,
thank
you.

A
gull
hit
me,

Oh,
hi.
I
was
wondering...
Uh,
that
sign
there.
Do
you
suppose
I
was
planning
on
renting
it
I've
tried
Well,
all
right.

I
just
picked
up
I
hadn't
planned
Yes,
I
know.
Yes.
May
I
use

phone?
I
just
put
some
coffee

what
you
said,

How
long
have
you
known
her?
In

was
selling
birds?
No,
no.
I
just
led

very
complicated.

about

don't
expect

don't

wrong?
No,
it's
not

you
like

I'll
get
it.

would
you
like

you.
Won't

call

you.
especially
if
you're

how
did
Did
you
meet
Lydia?

Or
would
you
rather
I
think
so.
-
Well,
how
do
you
like

suppose
it
doesn't
offer
much

you're
thrilled

takes
a
bit

are

did
you
happen

I
see
no
reason

was

needn't
worry.

been
over
and
done
with

there's

there
isn't.
Maybe
there's

do
you
mean?
I
think
I'll
have
I
was
seeing
a
lot
of
him
One
weekend,
he
invited
me
-
When
was
this?
Of
course,
things
With
Lydia.
Did
she
seem
Well,
then
perhaps
things

know,
her
attitude
When
I
got
back
to
what
I'd
done
-
Well,
what
had
you
done?
I
simply
existed.
A
clinging,

Wrong.
With
all
due
respect
Then
what
was
it?
Lydia
liked
me.
Now
that
I'm
no
longer
a
threat,
-
Then
why
did
she

Afraid
you'd
take

I
don't
understand.

Afraid
of
any
woman
who
That
adds
up
to
No,
I
don't
think
so.
You
see,
she's
not
afraid

only
afraid
-
Someone
ought
to
tell
her
No.

already
Well,
what
about
Mitch?
Well,
I
can
understand
He'd
just
been
through
-
He
didn't
want
to
risk
So
it
ended.

We
went
back
to
San
Francisco,
-
Then
what
are
you
doing

it
was
over
and
done
with,

I
still
wanted
I
still
like
him
and
I
don't
want
to

no,
no,

on.
It's

you.

can

kind
of

I
couldn't.
No,
I
wouldn't
want

see.
All
right.

Good
night,
Mitch.

He
wants
me
to
go
to
Cathy's
It
should
be
fun.
I'll
be
there,
too,

Oh,
it
seems
so
pointless.

I
think
My
luggage.
That's
pretty.
Mm-hmm.
Do
you
think
Well,
that's
up
to
you.
No,
it's
really
-
Never
mind
Lydia.

Then
go.

Is
someone
there?

is
it?
