not
important
to
me.
I

Amanda.
It's
okay.

This
was
your
test...
...your
game.

I
want
to
play
a
game.
You're
being
tested.
Your
will

Your
will
to
keep
Can
you
do
that?
Can
you
and
grant
someone
I
was
testing
you.
I
took
you
in.
You
will
give
Yes.
I
selected
you
for
the
honor
of
carrying
on
But
you
didn't.
That's
right.
I'm
a
murderer.
I
despise
murderers.
You
didn't
test
Game
over.
Instead
you
took
away
Your
games
were
unwinnable.
Your
subjects
merely
victims.
There
is
no
turning
back.
Do
you
understand
that?
In
my
desperation,
So
I
put
You
chose
her
'cause
That's
one
reason
You
didn't
know
that
I
had
to
keep
that
from
you
I
had
to
leave
out
the
cheating
wife,
the
vengeful
husband,
And
I
let
you
make
I
wanted
you
to
succeed.
Amanda,
put
it
away.
Trust
me,
it's
Lynn
who
holds
She's
not
Unlock
her
collar
I
said
no!
The
rules
of
our
game
We
need
to
abide
You
couldn't.
God.

Game
over.
You
haven't
learned
Your
rage
will
only
hurt
Killing
me
will
only
add
It
will
not
bring
back
Think
of
your
daughter,
She
needs
you
now
You
can't
kill
me,
Jeff.


Her
time's
running
out.

Jeff,
do
not
miscalculate.
Your
fate
is
in
my
hands.
Your
wife's
fate
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
I'm
taking
you
home.
Okay?
Though
you
may
not
there
are
threats
Jeff,
if
you
try
to
move
I
can
have
an
ambulance
Would
you
like
to
take
your
Would
you
like
Stay.
Stand
and
face
me,
Jeff.
Stay
with
me,
please.
Would
you
like
to
get
Would
you,
Jeff?
I
can
make
that
happen.
Which
is
it,
Jeff?
Come
on...yes
or
no?
Yes.
What
do
you
want?
One
final
test.
The
rules
are
simple.
Over
on
that
table,
there's
...which
you
can
use
to
take
your
vengeance,
to
indulge
your
obsession.
Or
you
can
choose
to
put
and
you
can
forgive.
You
can
forgive
me
that
I've
caused
you

Which
is
it
gonna
be,
Jeff?

Honey,
don't
do
it.
Jeff...
It's
up
to
you.

Live
or
die,
Jeff?
Make
our
choice.
I
forgive
you.
Jeff...
Jeff.
Jeff!

I
forgive
you.

Hello,
Jeff.
I
made
this
tape
as
an
insurance
Jeff!
And
if
you're
then
it's
time
to
collect.
I
was
your
final
test
And
if
you
are
then
you
failed.
Now
you
must
pay
the
price
for
living
Now
I
will
give
you
I
told
you
that
but
I
didn't
tell
you
why,
and
the
answer
is
simple.
I
am
the
person
responsible
I
am
the
only
person
who
She
only
has
a
limited
and
if
you
want
you'll
have
to
play
a
game.
Jeff!
