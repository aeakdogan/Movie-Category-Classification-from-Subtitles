me
You
got

Yeah.

Put
it
down
over

But
she
told
me

Yeah,
well,
I
don't

5:30.
My

clock's
not
working,
Yeah,
exactly,
We're
having
steak.
It
all
defrosted,
You
should
come
on
out.
Yeah,
that
was
stupid
of
me.
I
froze
4
pounds
of
steak...
...now
I'm
standing
here
I'm
not
joking.
Come
on
out,
please,
Well,
tell

not
to
be
so
difficult.
Hold
on
a
second.

What
is
it,

Okay.

I'd
like
to
see

Tell
your

So,
what
do
you
think?
Well,
tell
your
sweetheart
Jump
in

we've
got
enough
steak

sent
me.
She's
cooking
and
she
ran
out
of
eggs
Of
course.
How
many
does
she
need?
Four.
ANN:
What
for?
-
Excuse
me?
What
does
she
need
the
eggs
for?
I
have
no
idea.
So
are
they
okay
just
like
this
Whatever
you
want.
How
did
you
get
in
here?
Down
there.
I
mean,
down
by
the
water.
But
you're
not
wet.
There's
a
hole
in
the
fence.
Fred
sh...
I
mean,
Mr.
Thompson,
Oh,
I
see.
So
you
sure
they're
okay
like
this?
Yeah,
yeah.
That's
okay.
No
problem.

you
very
much.
Thank
you.
Say
hello
to
Eve.
Tell
her

I'll
tell
her.
Thanks
again.
ANN:
PETER:
Shit.
It's
not
a
disaster.
We
have
to
go
grocery
shopping
PETER:
ANN:
It's
not
so
bad.
None
of
us
eat
eggs
So
the
disaster's
under
control.
PETER:
Well,
thank
you.
I'm
sorry,
ANN:
Well,
you
shouldn't
cry
PETER:
ANN:
I
really
am
sorry.
I'm
very
clumsy,
you
know?
-
Then
you're
the
man
for
carrying
eggs.
So,
what
are
we
going
to
do
now?
Well,
we
have
a
lot
of
steak,
...and
they
definitely
eat
eggs
You'll
still
have
four
left.
It's
a
box
with
a
dozen,
isn't
it?
No,
you're
not
mistaken.
So
would
you
like
the
carton
this
time?
-
It's
not
necessary.
But
if
you
insist.
If
I
insist?
Well,
it
might
be
better,
I
guess.
-
Oh,
God.
Oh,
no.
I'm
sorry.
Before
you
destroy
...maybe
you
should
take
the
eggs
Yes.
No
carton?

I'm
really
sorry.
Honestly.
Me
too.
Here
you
go.
Thank
you
very
much.

you.

down.

out
of
here.

on,
get
lost.

sorry.

completely
harmless.
That's
a
strange
way
to
play.
-
Did
he
hurt
you?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Me
too.
He
jumped
on
me.
-
I'm
really
sorry.
-
Should
I
lock
him
up
so
you
can
leave?
-
I
can
call
my
husband.
It's
my
fault.
I
should've
come
myself
and...
Wow.
That's
a
really
great
set
of
clubs.
It's
Callaway,
right?
Awesome.
These
are
wonderful.
May
I?
I
guess
we
don't
The
club
doesn't
make
the
player.
That's
true.
Would
you
mind
if
I
tried
this?
Just
once,
please?
Real
quick.
Outside.
Please?
Yes?
I'll
hit
it
towards
the
bay.
Yes?
If
it
makes
you
happy.
Thank
you.
Thanks
a
lot.
Really.
Thank
you.
Excuse
me.
He
loves
golf.
We
both
do.
-
Excuse
me?

Lucky!
Lucky.
Be
quiet.
-
What's
the
matter
with
him?
It's
probably
too
hot
for
him
too.


I'll
take
a
look.
PAUL:
It's
wonderful.
It
really
Thanks
a
lot.
Sure.

PAUL:
Where's
Tom?
PAUL:
Excuse
me?
Driver's
really
first
class.
Listen,
young
man,
I
don't
know
...but
I
don't
wanna
be
a
part
of
it.
Would
you
please
leave
now?
What
game?
I'm
sorry,
ma'am,
but
I
don't
understand
-
Did
Tom
or
I
do
anything
to
upset
you?
Did
you
misbehave
while
I
was
outside?
-
Did
he
say
something
that...?
I've
asked
you
nicely
to
leave.
Well...
I
don't
understand
what's
upset
you,
Just
give
Tom
the
eggs,
Excuse
me?
We'll
have
to
tell
Eve
and
Fred.
Nothing
What
about
you?
-
Can
you
just
give
us
the
eggs,
please?
How
dare
you.
Please
just
go.
Right
now.
Did
I
do
something
wrong?
I
asked
you
to
leave.
I
want
you
to
go.
GEORGE:
-
Will
you
throw
them
out?
-
That's
your
name,
isn't
it?
Farber?
Yeah,
Fre...
Mr.
Thompson
told
us.
-
What's
going
on?
Your
wife's
under
the
wrong
impression.
I'm
certain
you
can
-
George,
please.
Just
go.
Please,
go.
Hey,
Ann.
This
is
ridiculous.
I
can't
believe
this.
-
Honey,
do
you
mind?
-
May
I
please
explain
what
happened?
Mrs.
Thompson
sent
me
over
Your
wife
gave
Peter
the
eggs,
And
then
she
gave
me
...but
the
dog
jumped
on
me,
You
had
a
dozen
and
you're
going
We
just
want
the
eggs,
that's
all.
Ann,
can
you
tell
me
Honey,
can
you
just
tell
Just
give
them
to
them.
-
Can
I
have
them
now?
Ann,
if
it's
just
about
some
eggs,
ANN:
Look,
I'm
not
going
I
asked
you
to
throw
them
out.
Do
what
you
want.
I've
had
enough.
Ann.
I'm
sorry.
My
wife's
not
feeling
well,
so...
Yeah.
Could
you
please
leave?
I
can
hardly
play
the
mediator
So
could
you
just
leave,
please?
Please,
the...
-
What?
-
What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
He
asked
for
the
eggs,
Now
he
would
like
some
more.
You
better
watch
your
tone,
You
better
be
careful,
old
man,
Now,
please
leave,
right
now.
PAUL:
Mr.
Farber?

GEORGIE:
PETER:
Hey,
hey,
come
on,
come
on,
Hey.
Come
on.
Behave
yourself.
Behave
yourself,
okay?
Okay?
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you...
...so
you
have
to
behave
yourself.
GEORGIE:
Mom.
PETER:
Please,
just,
ma'am,
Please,
stay.
-
He
slapped
me
in
the
face.
PETER:
You
can
help
him,
-
You
should
bring
him
a
chair.
It's
my
knee.
PETER:
You
should
take
off
his
pants.
Go
get
him
a
chair,
honey.
Be
careful.
PAUL:
Peter
is
a...
He's
a
medical
student.
PETER:
If
you
don't
let
me
see
I'm
sorry
I
hurt
you,
PAUL:
Come
on,
Mr.
Farber,
He
can
help
you
with
it.
Would
you
please...
...leave?
Please.

have
to
let
him
help
you,
You're

ship's
captain,

You're
aware
that
onboard,
So,
what
do
you
want
to
do?
You
want
to
call
someone?
An
ambulance
or
the
police?
I
won't
stop
you.
Neither
will
Tom.
Right,
Tom?
Well,
what
are

waiting
for?

dropped
the
cell
phone
in
the
sink.
-

are
you
doing
this?

game.

ball.

ball.

why
do
I
have
it
in
my
pocket?
Hm?
The
lady
knows
why.
Because?
Well?
Well?
Because
you
didn't
hit
it.
Correct.
Because
I
didn't
hit
it.
Because
something
stopped
you.
Correct.
Because
I
had
Where
is
he?

Would
you
please
go
to
the
kitchen
That
be
possible?
Maybe
there's
some
bananas
or...
Please
don't
think
about
bringing
back
...or
I'd
be
sorry.
For
you,
I
mean.
It's
getting
cloudy.

thing,
Hm?
We
saw
your

When
did

We're

Paul.
He's
staying
-
Hi,
pleased
to
meet
you.
-
Oh,
no,
I
have...
I
have
eczema.
You
should
go
swimming,
Thank
you,
that's
good
advice.
-
Hello,
pleased
to
meet
you.
How's
George?
Fine,
thanks.
Where
is
he?
He
pulled
a
muscle
putting
up
the
mast,
BETSY:
So
sorry
to
hear
that.
That's
what
Robert,
on
the
other
hand,
Right,
Robert?
Tell
your
hubby
to
get
better,
ANN:
I
mean
it,
as
soon
as
he's
better,
He
brought
his
little
girlfriend.
All
right.
Well,
listen,
Listen,
if
the
weather
stays
like
this,
-
It's
supposed
to
be
windy.
PAUL:
Where's
your
dock?
PAUL:
Oh,
it's
just
around
the
peninsula,
The
old
cottage,
with
the
red
dock?
BETSY:
It's
very
beautiful.
Well,
thank
you,
we
enjoy
it.
Well,
anyway,
it's
good
to
see
you.
So
you're
here
all
week?
BETSY:
Maybe
we'll
come
by
tonight.
BETSY:
ANN:
All
right.
Yeah,
see
how
he
is.
Bye-bye.
-
Bye.
They'll
be
here
in
two
hours...
...and
then
this
little
charade
of
yours
PETER:
Didn't
you
ask
your
friends
to
call
...or
did
I
misunderstand
something?
They'll
come,
PAUL:
Just
a
second.
PETER:
Why
don't
you
have
a
landline?
Or
is
it
Please,
have
a
seat.
You
know
you
can
be
completely
We're
being
completely
open
with
you.
ANN:
PETER:
PAUL:
You
know,
if
you'd
let
Peter
PETER:
I'm
happy
to
help,
really,
PAUL:
That's
a
good
idea,
put
it
up.
PETER:
-
You
sure
you
don't
wanna
put
a
pillow...?
You're
asking?
ANN:
You
said,
"Please."
I'm
very
happy
about
this.
It's
easier
when
things
are
polite.
I'd
like
to
apologize
for
before.
But
you
have
to
admit,
George,
It
really
wasn't
I'm
Paul.
This
is
Peter.
Come
here,
Tom.
Where
are
ANN:
PAUL:
What's
this
now?

What,
didn't
we
just
agree
that?
Jesus
Christ!


It's
okay.
It's
okay.

PETER:
Stop
it
now,
Stop
it!
Do
you
understand?

Calm
down.
Calm
down.
So
much
stress
for
politeness'
sake.
