LORRAINE:
After
everything
we've
seen,
there
isn't
much
that
rattles
But
this
one...
This
one
still
haunts
me.
Two
months
prior
to
our
involvement,
the
Lutz
family
had
fled
their
home
claiming
that
the
house
was
haunted.
The
Church
had
reached
out
to
us
for
help.
They
wanted
to
see
if
we
could
confirm
the
activity
-

Okay.
We
ready?
Then
let's
get
started.
I'd
like
you
to
sit
quietly

Envision
yourself
in
a
halo
It
will
protect
you.
LORRAINE:
The
year
before
a
young
man
named
Ronny
DeFeo
had
brutally
murdered
We'd
hoped
to
discover
if
the
killings
or
if,
as
Ronny
DeFeo
testified
in
court,
he
had
been
under
the
influence

Honey,

What

you
seeing?


ED:
Lorraine.
Lorraine,
what
is
happening?
I
have
to
see.
We're
through.
We're
through.
What
is
happening?


It
wants
to
show
me.







Lorraine!
Lorraine!

Oh,
God!
Oh!
Honey.
-
Honey.
-
It's
okay.
ED:
It's
okay.
Ed.
This
is
as
close
to
hell
-




-
Damn
kids!
-
Yeah.
KID:
Oh,
my
gosh.
CAMILLA:
Keith
and
I
are
going
to
sneak
who
wants
to
meet
you,
by
the
way.
No
way.
So
don't
get
caught,
you
priss.
Here,
hold
this.
Gotta
give
you
back
I
think
I'll
let
Keith
French
kiss
me.
What?
No
way!
MRS.
MORE:
What
you
two
doing?
Janet,
give
that
to
me.
And
get
inside,
both
of
you.
Go.


M-M-M-M-Margaret.
Margaret!
Johnny!
Janet!
Billy!

Hello.
How
was
your
day?
Not
good.
Why?
What
happened?
It's
a
long
story.
I'll
tell
you
later.
All
right,
then.

W-w-what's
up?
B-B-B-B-Billy?
Shut
up,
Peter.
Lesbo!
What,
are
you
talking
about
your
mum?
-
Oh.
Thank
you,
Camilla.
No
problem!
He's
just
a
wanker.
Ignore
him.

Okay.
-
JANET:
Mum's
gonna
kill
me.
JANET:
It
wasn't
me,
it
was
Camilla.
MARGARET:
What
did
you
do
with
Camilla?
-
JANET:

It's
a
long
story.
-
Janet!
Ow!
Come
on.
PEGGY:
I'm
saying
I
won't
be
able

No.
I
talked
to
them,
WOMAN:

Please
keep
calm...
I
am
being
calm.
Well,
I
don't
understand
No.
No.
He
hasn't
paid
a
penny
-
We're
home!
-
JOHNNY:
Hi,
Mum!

PEGGY:
Janet.
Are
things
not
bad
enough
around
here,
that
I've
got
to
get
a
call
who
says
that
you
was
caught
smoking?
I
wasn't!
I
wasn't
smoking.
I
promise.
-
Did
you
get
the
biscuits?
I
talked
to
Mrs.
More
on
the
telephone.
How
can
you
stand
there
I'm
not
lying!
Yes,
she
is!
It's
all
over
the
school.
She
was
smoking
with
Camilla.
Shut
up!
You
are
such
a
liar,
Johnny!

Mum!
You
said
No,
Billy.
I
didn't
get
because
we
don't
have
any
bloody
money!

MARGARET:
Mum's
coming.
You
better
quit
messing
with
that

All
right.
-

Sounds
like
the
whole
city's
Look
what
I
found!
-
Biscuits!

But
you
said
we
Well,
I've
been
meaning
-
Margaret?
Have
you
got
your
Yes,
Mum.
I'm
getting
it.
PEGGY:
Johnny,
did
you
brush
your
teeth?
JOHNNY:
I
did
it
already.
PEGGY:
Come
on,
Billy.
Time
for
bed.
BILLY:

Coming,
Mum.
PEGGY:
Put
that
down,
Johnny.


Oh,
where'd
that
come
from?
Camilla
and
I
made
it
at
school.
Ugh.
That
doesn't
look
right.
It
really
works,
I
swear.
We
already
asked
it
all
sorts
of
stuff.
Come
on,
I'll
show
you.
All
right.
What
should
I
ask?
I
don't
know.
Whatever
you
want.
Okay.
My
sister
and
I
want
to
know...
Are
there
any
spirits
here

Is
Dad
ever
coming
home?
Are
there
any
spirits
here
Don't
worry
about
it.
It's
just
a
stupid
game.
It
isn't
real.



-







Why're
you
pounding
on
the
door?
I'm
not.

You're
barmy.
PEGGY
N.:
You
know,
she's
PEGGY:
She
says
she
wasn't
smoking.
I
don't
think
you
should
God
knows
I
had
my
share
PEGGY:
Oh,
lots.
But
it's
not
what
she
did
that
bothers
me.
It's
that,
she
don't
listen
PEGGY
N.:
Just
a
phase,
isn't
it?
I
mean,
I
can
punish
her,
because
I
know
it's
not
really
her
fault.
She
loves
her
dad
and
she
took
it
But
I
can't
just
let
it
go
either,
can
I?
I'm
loath
to
ask,
but
have
you
I
would,
if
I
ever
saw
him.

Sod.
Now,
it's
like
I'm
having
to
do
both
jobs.
I'm
half
the
mum
I
was
before.
You
are
not,
Peggy.

-
Ooh!
-
This
sodding
house!

We
are
back
with
real
life
ghost
hunters,
talking
about
their
experiences
And
now
we're
gonna
talk
to
my
next
guest,
Dr.
Steven
Kaplan,
who
says
that
the
into
the
Amityville
haunting
Why
is
that?
Well,
it's
been
well
established
-
But
that
hasn't
stopped...
Yes,
it
has.
The
Lutz
family
made
everything
up
so
That's
just
not
true.
Look,
we
see
this
all
the
time.
It's
very
easy
to
sit
on
the
outside
But
it's
something
very
different
to
have

I
don't
need
to
go
to
the
moon
to
Listen,
Ed
Warren's
never
seen
a
house
And
by
the
time
his
wife
is
done
they've
got
everybody
else
What
exactly
are
you
a
doctor
of,
anyway?

Come
on,
Warren.
I'm
not
gonna
show
class
to
somebody
who's
sitting
here
telling
-
Be
careful
who
you
call
a
liar.

We
go
on
these
shows
to
inform
people.
But
every
time
I
open
my
mouth,
-
Ed.
Academics...
Pops
up.
Tries
to
undo
everything
we've
done.
-
Could
you
please
take
a
breath?
I'm
counting
to
10.
I'm
counting
to
10!
JANET:
All
right,
Billy.
You
ready
to
do
a
speech?





It's
all
right.
We'll
just
try
again.
JANET:
You
ready?


Good
boy!
You're
getting
so
good.
-
Biscuit!
All
right.
Come
on.
Off
to
bed
with
you.

-
JANET:
Night,
Mom.
Now,
don't
eat
too
many
of
those
or
you'll
wake
up
thirsty
I
won't.
You
promise?
-
Night,
boys.
-




No.

Help.
Stop
it.
No.

Janet?
-
Please.
Janet,
wake
up!
You're
dreaming.

JANET:

This
is
my
house.

No.
No,
it's
not.
Go
away.
Who
are
you?
What
are
you
doing
here?


Leave
Billy
alone.
Janet,
who
are
you
talking
to?
You
have
to
go
away.

Janet,
wake
up.

I'll
tell

I'll
break
her
neck.

No,
please.

Dying
with
Billy.

No.
Janet.
-
Janet,
it's
all
right.
It's
all
right,
come
on.
Go
back
to
sleep.
Stay
away
from
Billy!
Leave
us
alone.
You
hear
me?
Janet,
what
are
you
doing?
MAN:

This
is
my
house.
-








Mum!
Mum!

Mum!
Mum!
Billy?
What's
wrong?

There's
someone
in
my
tent!
What?

There's
someone
in
my
tent!


Mummy.


See?
Nothing.
You
just
had
a
bad
dream.
That's
all.


-
Go
to
your
room.


Oh,
my
God.
-
Janet!
You
nearly
gave
me
a
heart
attack.
I
think
I've
been
sleepwalking
again.
What
do
you
mean
"again"?
-

You're
burning
up.
Come
on.
Come
on,
let's
get
you
back
upstairs,
eh?
Think
you
better
stay
home
Come
on.
Let's
get
you
back
into
bed,
eh?


MAN:

You
know
I
want
to
be
a
hair

WOMAN:
Don't
give
me
any

-
...back
30
years.
Now,
I've
gone
back
to
the
age
of
10.
Everything
is
shot
in
soft
focus.
-
Some
bogus
excuses.
When're
you
gonna
leave
And
get
yourself



Yes,
a
Christmas
carol.
-
MAN
1:
Which
one?



-


Mr.
Chairman,
Mr.
President,
I
stand
before
you
tonight,
in
my
Red
Star
chiffon
evening
gown.

-


Hodgson
residence.
Oh.
Hi,
Mum.
Yeah,
a
little.
I
just
ate,
so
I'm
not
really
that
hungry.

Yeah.
I'm
here.
Do
you
know
when
you'll
be
home?
All
right.
Bye,
Mum.


THATCHER:

Yes,
I
am
an
iron
lady.
The
Iron
Lady
of
the
Western
world.


No,
no.
You
are
a
bad
one,
you
know,
you.
Mother
dearest,
I'm
sorry
I
am
late.
But
I
had
to
stop
off

MAN:
I
do
not
wish
to
hear
I
want
you
to
come
over
here,
if
you
scrape
the
fluff
out
of
your
belly
button.

Nice
and
clean
for
the
big
parade
I
shall
be
there,
you
know,
watching
you.


-


-
My
house!


You're
up
early.

Hey.
Yeah,
I
couldn't
sleep.
You
get
inspired?
I
don't
know
if
I'd
call
it
that.
I
had
this
crazy
dream.
Saw
this
thing.
When
I
woke
up...
Couldn't
get
it
out
of
my
head.
So,
thought
maybe
this
might
help.
Hey,
I
know
I'm
no
Picasso,

We
need
to
stop.
We
could
still
do
the
lectures,
At
least
not
for
a
little
while.
All
right.
Uh...
Could
I
ask
why?
Because
if
it's
the
TV
shows
and
publicity
-
Good
morning.
ED:
Morning.
Do
you
trust
me?
You
know
I
do.
Then
please
trust
me
now.
Okay.

Oh.
What
are
you
doing
that
for?
In
case
I
go
sleep
walking
again.



-


Mum?
Johnny?
-








-


Janet!
What's
wrong?
What
is
it?
There's
someone
in
the
room!
There's
no
one!
What
you
talking
about?
-


-
There's
someone
in
our
room!
Our
beds
are
shaking
up
and
down!
Janet,
I
swear
to
God
I
got
bit.
I'm
not
lying!
He
bit
me!
Look!
Oh,
my
God.
Have
you
two
been
playing
with
this?
Taking
turns
scaring
the
wits
No
wonder
I
can't
get
-
But,
Mum...
Now
get
back
to
bed,
the
lot
of
you!
-

Help
us!
-
Please
help!
Peggy!
Vic,
open
the
door!
PEGGY:
Open
the
door!
I've
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes.
The
bloody
thing
But...
-
Well,
then...
It's
cold.
Top
to
bottom.
There's
no
one
there.
PEGGY:
What
about
Margaret
VIC:
No,
no.
I
looked
there,
every
room.
Even
went
down
the
basement.
-

We've
taught
him
to
ring
the
bell
-


Now,
what
they
doing
here?
-
VIC:
Oh,
I
called
them.
Well,
I
mean,
it's
got
to
be
somebody
PEGGY
N.:
It's
got
to
be.
Yeah.
So,
ma'am.
You
didn't
actually
No.
But
I
don't
think
she's
making
it
up.

Well,
look.
Sir,
that's
why
we're
here,
okay?
-


Bring
me
a
chair
from
the
kitchen.


It's
coming
from
inside
the
wall.
Then
what?
Mice,
maybe?
PEGGY:
Big
bloody
mouse.


Well,
there's
nothing
We
can
file
an
incident
report
But
that's
about
all.
A
report?
Oh.
That's
brilliant.
Every
problem
I
have,
Oh,
for
God's
sake.
Listen.
I
think
this
is
a
bit
beyond
us.
The
priest
at
our
church
I'll
ask
him
to
call
on
you.
WOMAN:

There
are
still
some
honest
And
she
said,
what
happened
was,
She
left
her
wallet
there,
It
had
money
in
it,
a
lot
of
money.
And
she
thought,
"Well,
She
thought
someone
That's
it,
that's
that.
But
just
to
see
what
she
could
do,
she
went
back
to
the
Some
honest
woman
had
picked
up
the
wallet
She
got
everything
back.
She
got
everything
that
was
in
the
purse.

Judy?
Honey...
What's
wrong?

Mom.
Who's
that?
Go
back.

-

Who
are
you?

Tell
me
who
you
are!
-
Mom!
Mom.
Mom!
Wake
up!
What
do
you
want?
I'm
sorry,
Lorraine.



Are
you
okay?
I'm
okay.
Mrs.
Hodgson.
Yes?
My
name's
Kent
Allen.
We're
with
the
television
I
was
hoping
to
have
a
word
with
you
about
How'd
you
find
out
about
that?
The
police
constables
filed
Well,
it's
raised
a
few
eyebrows.
I'd
rather
not
have
my
business
if
you
don't
mind.
Good
day!
Is
it
still
happening?
Because
if
it
is
might
be
your
best
chance
of
finding
help.
ALLEN:

This
thing
on?
Okay.
Behind
the
doors
of
this
in
Ponders
End,
North
London,
HAZEL:
I
look
up,
and
through
the
window,
Janet,
being
thrown
around
in
the
air
So
we
run
back
inside
and
sure
enough
there's
little
toy
LEGO
bricks
One
of
them
hit
me
right
in
the
face
CONSTABLE
HEEPS:
across
the
floor,
I
checked
the
chair
for
wires,
ALLEN:
Maurice
Grosse
is
an

has
been
investigating
these
claims
Well,
I
don't
think
there's
The
sheer
number
of
documented
incidents
But,
Anita
Gregory,
a
parapsychologist

is
not
convinced.
Our
principal

At
the
center
of
these
frightening
I
recently
interviewed
Janet
What
happened
next
will
astonish
you.
How
does
it
feel
I
don't
know.
You
don't
get
used
to
it.
You
see,
we
was
just
a
normal
family
It's
been
getting
worse
ALLEN:
How
do
you
mean?
Like,
asking
it
questions.
Saying
knock
twice
for
"yes"
That
sort
of
thing.
I
wonder
what
would
happen
Is
anybody
there?
Is
anybody
there
I
say
again,
is
anybody
there?
ALLEN:
Nothing.
Well,
it
isn't
a
jukebox,
is
it?

Janet,
are
you
all
right?

-


Mmm.
ALLEN:
Janet.
Janet,
are
you
feeling
all
right?

Stop
calling
me
Janet!
Isn't
that
your
name?

Janet's
asleep...
And
I'm
talking.

Well,
what
should
I
call
you?


What
is
your
name?

You
don't
belong
here.
My
name
is
Maurice
Grosse.
Who
are
you?
This
is
my
home.
Get
out
now!
No.
This
is
not
your
house.
Knock,
knock.

Very
well.
Who's
there?
Bill.
Bill.
Bill.
Bill.
Bill
who?
My
name
is
Bill
Wilkins
Where
do
you
come
from?
I
come
from
the
grave.
MAURICE:
How
did
you
die?
I
went
blind
and
had
a
hemorrhage.
And
I
fell
asleep
Why
have
you
come
here?

I
like
to
hear
them
scream.


Why
don't
you
just
leave
us
alone?
Shut
up,
you
old
cow!

Janet,
darling.
Darling,
are
you
all
right?

I'm
sorry.
Janet.
PEGGY:
Peggy,
what
am
I
gonna
do?
-
Oh...
You
don't
need
to
think
about
it
tonight.
And
you
and
the
kids
can
stay
here

Mum.
Billy,
aren't
you
supposed
I
thought
you
might
like
some
biscuits.
Oh...

Oh,
thank
you!









Baron?

Knock,
knock.
MAURICE:
Very
well.
Who's
there?
BILL:
Bill.
Bill.
Bill.
Bill.
MAURICE:
Bill
who?
BILL:
My
name
is
Bill
Wilkins
What
do
you
make
of
that
voice?
He
sounds
confused.
Is
he
senile?
The
voice
on
this
tape
is
coming
The
family's
reached
out
Yes.
But
truthfully,
we've
been
The
case
has
turned
into
They're
calling
it
"England's
Amityville."
Great.

You're
afraid
it's
a
hoax.
The
Church's
ability
to
help
people
So,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
We'd
like
you
to
fly
to
London
for
three
days
to
act
Now,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything.
If
it
is
a
hoax,
you
just
But
if
it's
not...
Then
there
is
a
family
in
London

ED:
Thank
you
for
your
faith
in
us.
-
All
right.
Well,
just
let
me
know.
I
told
him
we'd
talk
about
it.

There's
nothing
to
talk
about.
Honey,
you
heard
him.
They
don't
want
us
to
get
involved.
Just
observe
and
report
back.
There
have
always
been
cases
There
has
never
been
a
family
I
had
a
vision
in
Amityville.

It
was
the
same
one
I
had
seven
years
ago.

I
had
a
premonition
of
your
death.
-

Wait.
That's
why
you
locked
You
saw
my
death?
You've
seen
it,
too.
The
demon
in
your
painting
is
real.
We
have
both
seen
the
same
inhuman
spirit.
It's
a
warning.
If
we
keep
doing
this,
you
are
going
to
die.
Your
visions
are
a
gift
from
God.
And
if
God
is
showing
you
my
death,
Maybe
you're
meant
Come
on.
We
don't
run
from
fights.

If
we
go...
If
we
do
this...
You
have
to
promise
me
If
anything
turns
out
we're
gonna
tell
the
Church,
Promise
me.
Promise
me,
Ed.
I
promise.

Mr.
and
Mrs.
Warren,
I'm
Maurice
Grosse.
Thank
you
so
much
for
coming.
I
believe
you're
gonna
be
staying
ED:
Always
better
to
be
in
the
mix.
MAURICE:
Oh,
yeah.
I
agree.
-

PEGGY:
You
didn't
have
to
do
this.
-
So
kind
of
you.
MAURICE:
This
is
it.
PEGGY:
Thank
you
very
much.
-
VIC:
How
you
doing?
You
all
right?
VIC:
Yeah.
They're
fine.
MAURICE:
Here
we
are.

There
we
go.
Ed,
we've
managed
to
capture
I
think
you'll
be
very
ED:
Great.
I'd
like
to
listen
You've
got
some
really
MAURICE:
Vic
Nottingham.
Hi,
Vic.
How
are
you?
Ed
Warren.
Hello,
Ed.
How
are
you?
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
Ed
Warren.
-
This
is
my
wife,
Lorraine.
-
Hello.
Well,
I'll
be
off
then,
Peg.
Will
you
tell
the
kids
I
said
hello?
Yeah.
Of
course,
I
will.
Nice
to
meet
you.
-
Nice
meeting
you.
-
So,
here
we
are,
Peggy.
PEGGY:
It's
just
me
and
Janet
here
now.
My
other
kids
are
staying
with
them.
This
is
where
the
girls
used
to
sleep,
Why
not?
Well,
most
of
the
activity
We
were
quite
afraid
which
is
why
we
keep
it
locked.
I
understand
that
Janet
has
levitated.
Did
that
happen
in
here
as
well?
-
Yeah,
more
than
once.
We've
got
photographs
of
that
as
well.
ED:
I'd
like
to
hear
Mrs.
Hodgson's
story
PEGGY:
The
neighbors
donated
them
hoping
they'd
keep
things
Has
it
worked?
No.
We
can
hear
it
all
night.


Hi,
there.
I'm
Lorraine.
Mind
if
I
have
a
seat?
Do
you
know
why
I'm
here?
Well,
your
mom
has
told
me
and
I'm
here
to
help,
if
I
can.
Would
you
like
to
talk
about
it?
You
know,
when
I
was
about
your
age,
and
I
saw
an
angel.
Yeah.
It
was
standing
next
to
It
was
just
gently
touching
his
cheek
And
it
looked
right
at
me.
Of
course,
my
mom
and
the
nurses
but
I
knew
it
was
real.
Look,
I
know
how
it
is.
I
know
what
it's
like
to
lose
your
friends
But
I
also
know
that
And
you
just
have
to
open
up
to
them.
How
did
you
know
you
could
trust
I
didn't.
Sometimes
I
got
hurt.
And
it
took
a
long
time,
but
I
finally
found
someone
What
did
you
do
then?
I
married
him.
I'm
just
so
tired.
I
can't
sleep
here.
I
used
to
go
to
the
medical
room
at
school
because
I
was
so
worn
out.
But
now
I
can't
even
do
that.
Everyone's
afraid
of
me.
I
got
no
friends.
No
place
I
can
go
to.
It
makes
me
feel
like
I'm
not
normal.
You
know,
whatever
is
doing
this
to
you
But
why?
Because
that's
what
makes
it
stronger.
PEGGY:
Around
the
time
this
all
started,
Janet
started
waking
up
here
This
is
the
spot
that
Janet
said
-

Uh...
My
ex-husband
bought
all
the
furniture
If
you
don't
mind
me
asking...
Uh,
is
your
ex-husband
Nope.
I'm
sorry
to
hear
that.
Any
chance
of
reconciliation?
He
had
twins
with
a
woman
So
I'm
gonna
take
that
as
a
"no."
-
Yeah,
it's
been
a
lot
to
deal
with.
He
took
all
the
music
the
day
he
left.
I
know
it
must
feel
like
that
sometimes...
No.
I
mean,
literally.
My
kids
used
to
love
listening
-
They've
been
through
so
much.
And
now,
all
this
is
happening
on
top.
Yeah.
The
timing
isn't
a
coincidence.
Negative
entities
often
They
like
to
kick
you
when
you're
down.
That
hardly
seems
fair.
No,
it
really
isn't.
LORRAINE:
Sometimes.
And
when
it
does,
does
it
feel
No.
More
like
it's
coming
from
behind
me.
Like
I'm
being
used.
Does
it
ever
say
things
just
to
you?
That
only
you
can
hear?
What
does
it
say?
It
said
it
wants
to
hurt
you.
When
did
it
say
that?
Right
now.

PEGGY:
Do
we
really
need
that?
ED:
We'd
like
to
be
that
she's
not
making
the
voice
herself.
So,
by
holding
the
water
in
her
mouth,
we'll
be
able
to
show
Does
she
have
to
be
in
the
chair?
Just...
It
makes
me
sick
to
see
her
We
know
it's
hard,
but
the
spirit
It'll
be
easier
for
Ed
to
contact
it
You'll
be
all
right.

You
ready
for
this?
I
guess
so.
-

This
is
Ed
and
Lorraine
Warren,
Also
present
is
Maurice
Grosse.
All
right.
Let's
get
started.

If
there's
something
here
that
would
we're
all
ears.
Speak
up.
What
do
you
want
It
says
it
won't
talk
with
you
Strange!
I
wonder
why
not?
It's
not
been
shy
about
How
about
if
we
all
turn
our
backs?
Think
it'll
speak
if
we
do
that?
Maybe.
Well...
Let's
try
this
again.

So
what
do
you
think,
Bill?
We've
given
you
your
privacy.
Now
come
on
out
and
talk
to
us.



BILL:
Here
I
come.
Am
I
talking
to
the
spirit
BILL:
Is
that
what
I
am?
Is
that
what
I'm
doing?
Yes.
And
I
have
come
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
Do
you
know
who
I
am?
BILL:
Ed.

Eddie.
Edward.
Ed
is
fine.
Your
father
called
you
Edward.
Not
true.
My
father
called
me
Ed,



Come
on,
Bill.
and
I'm
not
here
to
talk
about
my
father.
Let's
get
down
to
business,
Hmm?
Why
don't
you
BILL:
Because
this
is
my
house!
It's
not
your
house.
BILL:
Yes,
it
is.
I
come
here
to
see
my
family,
but
they're
not
here
now.
That's
because
you're
dead.
If
your
family
did
live
here,

BILL:
Where
are
they?
I
don't
know.
BILL:
I
don't
need
your
help.
Then
why
don't
you
just
move
on?
BILL:
I
don't
believe
in
that.
Why
not,
hmm?
What
would
be
so
wrong
BILL:
I
am
not
a
heaven
man!
Well,
I
got
news
for
you,
Bill.
You
see,
I
don't
care
what
you
believe
in.

You
see
this?

BILL:
Help...
it...
let...
go.
Help...
It...
Let...
Go!

ED:
Are
you
sensing
a
presence?
LORRAINE:
No,
just
the
opposite.
I'm
not
sensing
anything.
We
could
be
looking
That
would
explain
and
hallucinations.
That
doesn't
feel
right,
either.
Well...
I
can't
explain
it.
I
heard
that
voice
with
my
own
ears,
but
all
I
can
sense
is
their
own
fear.
I
can't
seem
to
see
beyond
that.

I
don't
think
I
can
sleep
Well,
you're
gonna.
It'll
give
you
something
Oh,
love.
I
wish
you
wouldn't
do
that.
It
helps
me
sleep.
At
least
I
know
I'm
not
going
anywhere.

I
didn't
smoke,
Mum.
Eh?
That
day
with
Camilla
at
school.
I
was
holding
the
cigarette,
but
I
wasn't
going
to
take
I
just
wanted
to
look
cool
It
was
stupid.
Oh,
love.
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
believe
you.
Oh,
darling.





Help!
Help!

Hmm.



-






-
Janet!
Ah!

Janet?
Oh,
my
God.
Janet?
Janet?
-
JANET:
Help!
Janet!
-

-
Mum!
JANET:

Please!
Mum!
-
Janet!
There's
somebody
in
here!
I
can't
open
it!
Mum!
Help
me!




-
Janet!

Janet!
-
What's
going
on?

PEGGY:
I
can't
get
it
open!
Get
the
key.
Go
get
the
key
now!

Janet!
Hold
on!
We're
coming!

I
got
the
key!
I
got
the
key!
ED:
Okay.
Okay.
Come
on.


PEGGY:
Janet,
we're
coming!
Janet.
Get
it
off
her!
Please
get
it
off
her!

PEGGY:
What
was
that?
There
was
someone
in
here!
I
saw
him
with
me
own
eyes.
-
He
did
this
to
my
girl.

GRAHAM:
This
is
the
bite
wound
It's
faded
a
bit
here,
Wow.
That's
pretty
distinctive.
Two
missing
teeth.
MAURICE:
That's
right.
And
it's
too
big
You
think
this
was
the
spirit?
I
tracked
down
the
home
owner.
And
it
turns
out,
His
name
was
William
Wilkins
and
he
died
Everything
she
said
is
true.
All
public
information,
by
the
way.
She
could
have
heard
LORRAINE:
And
what
about
the
claims
that
Janet
has
been
teleporting
About
as
valid
as
their
claims
Were
any
of
you
there
when
it
happened?
No.
But
I
have
pictures
of
that
too.
Yeah.
There
you
go.
I
set
my
camera
up
in
the
girls'
room
and
then
waited
downstairs
And
fired
it
off
whenever
I
have
to
admit.
The
way
her
knees
are
bent,
It
looks
like
she's
just
jumping.
What
are
you
saying?
You
saw
it
with
your
own
eyes.
Well,
Peggy
was
the
one
who
But
she
teleported
herself
into
a
room
locked
from
the
outside,
And
what
about
her
voice?
How
do
we
explain
that?
I
think
the
first
time
it
was
in
front
of
television
cameras.
And
she
couldn't
do
it
with
water
So
she
could
have
spit
it
out,
Last
year,
I
was
conned
by
a
Welsh
family

Honestly,
the
demons
or
the
people
who
prey
The
demons
are
worse.
But
you
must
admit,
it
is
suspicious.
You
sincerely
believe
And
what
about
Peggy?
She's
just
using
the
whole
to
get
better
housing
from
the
council.
She's
already
applied!
Look,
I'm
not
saying
it's
a
hoax.
Sometimes,
what
we
do
To
believe
when
nobody
else
will.
ANITA:
So
you
really
do
believe
them?
Yes.
We
do.
But
the
Church
can't
do
That's
what
we
need.
Right,
listen.
I'll
make
see
if
I
can
get
hold
of
some
In
the
meantime,
Ed
and
I
can
be
because
they
need
to
be
a
family
again.
Hi,
Mom!
We're
back!
PEGGY:
What
are
you
doing
back?
What's
all
this,
then?
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Warren
bought
us
some
vinyls.
They
got
us
an
Elvis
record!
PEGGY:
Oh,
Blue
Hawaii.
Hope
you
don't
mind.
Not
at
all!
-
BILLY:
Janet!
I
missed
you.
Hey,
guys,
I
missed
you.
So,
have
any
of
you
ever
been
Pete,
at
school.
He's
always
picking
on
Billy.
And,
dear,
tell
me,
what
do

They
stick
up
for
me.
Good,
because
the
spirit
in
this
house
-
is
a
lot
like
that
bully.
ED:
And
he's
got
it
in
for
Janet.
So
you
guys
gotta
stick
up
for
her,
Family
sticks
together.
This,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
lost
cause.
Oh,
bloody
hell.
We've
had
all
sorts
of
things
stop
working
-
for
no
reason
at
all.
We're
gonna
have
music
in
here
Whose
guitar
is
that?
Oh,
it
was
Dad's,
Yeah,
do
you
mind?
No.

I'm
a
little
rusty,

Especially
you.


-
Thank
you.
Hey,
don't
laugh
now.

Everybody
now.


Thank
you
very
much.


It's
so
small
and
light.

JANET:
Why
do
you
do
this?
Help
people
like
us?
When
you
were
little,
did
you
ever
hiding
under
your
bed
at
night?
Yeah?
Well...
My
bed
actually
had
something
under
it.
Yeah.
Something
grabbed
my
hand
It
was
too
dark
to
see
under
there,
but
You
know
what
my
dad
did?
He
dragged
me
right
back
into
the
room
And
I
was
scared
to
death.
But
then
I
remembered
"God
will
be
there
for
all
who
need."
So,
I
grabbed
this
crucifix
And
I
tell
whatever's
under
there
that
it
better
leave,

Best
thing
my
dad
ever
did
for
me.
Of
course
he
only
did
it
It
took
me
years
And
you
know
what
I
did
then?
You
married
her?
So
you've
heard
this
story
before?

All
right.
PEGGY:
How
you
getting
on
in
here?
Hey.
We're
done
here.
Fixed
the
closet
door,
too.
And
if
you'd
like,
I
could
take
a
look
No,
I
couldn't
ask
you
to
do
that.
It's
a
disaster
down
there.
Come
on.
How
bad
can
it
be?
Oh.
Bloody
hell.
Everything
still
quiet
in
there?
Yes.
Thank
goodness.
Yes.
It
would
be
something
though,
wouldn't
it?
If
we
were
able
to
prove
that
there
is
a
life
beyond
this?

It
would
be
historic.
Is
that
why
you're
doing
this?
Because
you
want
to
be
a
part
This
isn't
a
laboratory,
And
I
think
helping
that
family
No,
I'm
sorry,
I
didn't
mean
that.
My
daughter
died
in
a
car
Afterwards,
I
started
I
think
she
wanted
to
communicate
with
me.
And,
yes,
it
would
help
I
don't
know.
Somewhere.

That's
not
it.
Oh,
great.
Think
I
found
it.

All
right.

It's
right
here.
-

JOHNNY:
Come
and
get
it.
Margaret!
KID:
Johnny,
come
and
get
it.
Okay.

Think
I
got
it.
All
right.
There
we
go.
What's
that?
Ed?
There's...

ED:
What
is
it?
-
Oh,
Jesus!
ED:
Whoa!
Peggy!
Peggy!

He
grabbed
me.
It
was
him.
He
tried
to
pull
me
under.
Oh,
my
God!
Look!
Oh
God,
you're
scratched.
That's
not
a
scratch,
that's
a
bite
mark.
He
bit
me.
Just
like
he
did
Janet.


-
Aw.
Hey,
Janet,
can
you
get
me
another
one?
Yeah.


Janet?
What's
wrong?
Don't
you
see
it?
See
what?
In
the
kitchen.
Tell
me
what
you
see.
JANET:
It's
playing
with
the
knives,
hiding
in
the
dark.

Johnny!
Johnny,
what
you
doing?
Johnny,
no!
Johnny,
don't
go!
Remember
what
Mr.
Warren
said?
We
can't
let
it
bully
us.
This
is
our
house.
Johnny.
Johnny,
please
come
back.
-

What's
the
matter?
What's
happened?
Janet's
gone!
She
was
just
right
here!


Come
on.

-
No!
-
JOHNNY:
Mum!

Ed?
What's
going
on?
MARGARET:
Mum.
Mum,
Johnny's
in
there!
No!


Johnny!
-

Step
back.
-

Come
on.

PEGGY:
Where
are
they?
Johnny?

Darling!
Oh,
darling,
come
here.
Are
you
all
right?
It's
all
right,
darling.
It's
all
right.
Where's
Janet?
Where's
Janet?
Janet!


Guys,
I'm
picking
up
something
in
here.

-


Me...
Won't...
Me...
Won't...
Me...


PEGGY:
Janet.
ED:
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Come
on,
now.
It's
okay.
Watch
out.
Look
out.
-
Slowly!
-
Darling,
it's
all
right.
It's
all
right,
Mum's
here.
How
did
she
get
in
there?
It's
all
right,
darling.
What's
that?

PEGGY:
It's
fine.
Can
I,
uh...
What
is
it?
She's
faking
it.
What?
I
have
proof.


So
much
for
your
leap
of
faith.
PEGGY:
What?
My
girl
didn't
make
this
up.
She
was
caught
red-handed
faking
an
event.
No,
it's
not
possible.
How
could
a
12-year-old
girl
It's
over.
Do
you
understand?
For
the
sake
of
your
daughter,

She
couldn't
have
pulled
this
off
alone.
Oh,
how
dare
you.
What,
you
think
I
put
her
up
to
this?
What
about
the
police?
No,
it's
all
right.
What
about
you
two?
You
believe
us,
don't
you?
We
wanna
help.
But
the
Church
will
take
one
look
at
They'll
wanna
distance
themselves
from

I'd
like
you
to
leave,
please.
Now,
go
on,
get
out.
Get
out,
the
lot
of
you!
Get
out!
Perhaps,
you
could
somehow
You
know,
make
contact
with
it
yourself.
I
can't.
Believe
me,
I've
tried.
I'm
sorry,
I'm
just
not
So,
that's
it,
then?
You
hold
out
a
lifeline
to
them
We
don't
like
this
any
more
than
you
do.
We'll
tell
the
Church
But,
the
only
piece
is
a
video
of
Janet
faking
an
incident.
Yeah,
but
there
have
been
literally
You
might
want
this.
And,
just
because
she
faked
it
this
once,
No,
it
changes
everything.
We're
agents
of
the
Church
here.
They'd
be
calling
us
home
You've
done
really
You
were
here
for
them
Uh,
thank
you.
But,
sometimes
you
need
to
Believe
when
nobody
else
will.

This
doesn't
feel
right.
I
know.
Have
a
safe
trip.

Did
you
really
do
it?
Wreck
the
kitchen
and
all
that?
BILLY:
But,
why?
It
said
it
would
kill
you,
if
I
didn't
make
them
leave.
LORRAINE:
Don't
you
think
that
she
just
happened
to
fake
an
incident
in
the
one
room
of
the
house
Yeah.

No.
Oh,
damn
it.

Lorraine.
Help
me
set
up
these
tape
recorders.
Thread
it
through
All
right.
Remember
those
strange,
-
You
know,
from
Bill?
There
were
two
of
them,
right?
Here's
the
first
one.
BILL:
Help!
It...
Let
go!
Help!
It...
Let...
Go!
We
thought
he
was
referring
-
Yes.
BILL:
Me...
Won't...
Me...
Won't...
Me...

If
I'm
right
about
this...
BILL:
Help
me!
It
won't
let
me
go!
Help
me!
It
won't
let
me
go!

I
come
here
to
see
my
family.
But
they're
not
here
now.
I
think,
I'd
like
to
go
now.
-
But
I
can't.
It
wants
her.
So
badly.
It
almost
has
her.
Tell
me
how
to
stop
it.
I'm
given
and
I'm
taken.
I
was
there
at
your
first
breath.
You
didn't
ask
for
me.
But
I'll
follow
you
till
death.
Wait.
I
don't
understand.
Please...
-

Oh,
God!
You're
bleeding!

What
is
happening?
The
old
man's
spirit
is
just
a
pawn.
He's
been
enslaved
Enslaved?
Enslaved
by
who?
Something
inhuman.
Something
that's
taken
There
is
a
demonic
presence
in
that
house.
You
need
to
get
Vic
before
he
leaves.
Okay.



Mom,
help
me,
please!
Mom!
Please,
Mom,
help
me!
Help!

For
God's
sake,
leave
us
alone!


Margaret!
Margaret,
no!
Come
on,
let's
get
out
of
here!
Come
on,
let's
get
out!

-
Go
to
Peggy's
house!
I
can't
leave
Janet!

-
No!
Janet!
Janet!
VIC:
Well,
I
don't
understand
it.
I
mean,
first
you
say
it's
not
real,
Her
sight
was
being
blocked
The
old
man's
spirit
couldn't
break
Everything
they've
experienced
The
Old
Man,
the
Crooked
Man,
trying
to
keep
us
from
seeing
In
my
vision,
he
wanted
to
help
me,
And
he
kept
speaking
in
a
kind
of
riddle.


Something
like,
uh,
"I
was
there
at
your
first
breath.
"You
didn't
ask
for
me.
"But
I
will
follow
you
until
your
death."
Your
name.
You
didn't
ask
for
it.
That's
it!
Knowing
the
demon's
name
gives
us
Yeah,
sure,
but
we
don't
know
its
name.
But,
maybe
we
do.
Huh?
Why
else
would
he
give
us
that
clue?
He
must
think
that
we
know
it
somehow.
So,
what
do
you
do
now?
An
inhuman
spirit
powerful
enough
is
more
than
a
match
for
me.
We
need
to
get
Janet
to
the
Church
Janet!
What
happened?


PEGGY:
Janet!
Janet!
Thank
God
you're
here.
-
Janet's
in
there!

Damn
it.


-
Huh?
-
Ed!
Are
you
okay?
I'm
gonna
go
around
back!
No!
Ed!
No!
Ed,
no,
no,
no.
PEGGY:
I'm
gonna
come
with
you!

-
Peggy,
stay
here.
-
Wait
in
the
car
with
the
kids!
Wait!
Janet!

Get
in
the
car.
Go
in,
go
on.
You,
too,
Peggy.
Come
on!

Ed?
Ed?

Ed?
No!
Come
on!

Ed!
It
won't
open!
Let
me
try.

-
We
need
to
break
it
down!
-
Wait
here.
Ed,
hon,
wait
right
there.
Wait.
Vic'll
be
right
back.
I
can't
wait.
I'm
going
on
ahead.
No,
Ed,
don't!
Stop!
You
can't
fight
this
alone.
She
needs
our
help!
Ed,
please.
Please,
just
wait
for
me.
Please
wait
for
me.

I
can't
lose
you.
I
am
so
scared.
I
know.
Me,
too.
But
I
have
to
help
her.
But,
what
about
my
vision?
I
know
I
made
a
promise
to
you,
hon,
but
I
have
to
do
this.
I
love
you,
Lorraine.
Ed,
no!
No!
Stop!
Don't!
Ed!
No!

No.
Stop.

Ed!
Someone!
Help!





Move.



Oh,
God.
Janet,
where
are
you?
Come
on!





JANET:
Help!
ED:
Janet!
Janet!
JANET:
Help
me!
Janet!

In
the
name
of
the
Father,
and
the
Son,


What's
your
name?
What's
your...

What's
your
name?
I
do
know
your
name.
I
asked
you.
Tell
me
who
you
are!
And
you
told
me.
You
told
me
your
name.
And
I
wrote
it
down.
I
need
my
Bible!
Why?
What's
happening?
What...

The
demon's
name
gives
us
power
over
it.
V.
A.
L.
A.
K.
Valak.




ED:
Janet!
Janet?


There
was
a
crooked
man
And
he
walked
a
crooked
mile
He
found
a
crooked
sixpence
He
bought
a
crooked
cat
And
they
all
lived
together
in
a
little...
-




Vic!
Vic!
Let
me
through.
-
No,
wait,
Lorraine,
let
me
try.
Let
me
go
in.
Lorraine!
Ed!
Lorraine!
Lorraine!

Ed!


Janet?

Janet!
No!
No!

I
got
you.
-

No!

Janet.
Ed!
Ed!
-
Ah!

Ed!

Lorraine!
-

-


Ed!

Your
name
gives
me
dominion
And
I
do
know
your
name!

You
are
Valak!
The
defiler.
The
profane,
the
marquis
of
snakes!
In
the
name
of
the
Father
I
condemn
you
back
to
hell!



No!
Ed!

Come
on!
Ed!
ED:
Okay.
We're
good.
Okay.
-
Ed,
are
you
okay?
Janet?
Oh,
my
God!
Is
she
all
right?
I'll
call
an
ambulance.
-

Here
you
go
now.
Take
a
big,
deep
breath.
Big,
deep
breath.
There
you
go.
You
all
right?

He'll
be
fine.
-
Does
she
look
all
right?
You
saved
her.
No.
You
saved
us.
Didn't
I
tell
you
it
was
meant
to
be?

But
you
believed
in
me.
I
couldn't
have
done
it
without
you.
Thanks
for
coming
back
for
us.
Oh.

Aw.
Here,
sit
down.
Sit
down.

You
know...
This
has
kept
me
safe

I
want
you
to
have
it.
And,
when
you
grow
up,
you
find
someone
Deal?
I'm
so
lucky.
You
said
one
person
But...
I've
got
two.
Oh.

Okay.



ED:
Tell
me
about
the
beginning,
-
What
was
your
brother
doing?
I
wasn't
quite
sure,
no.
-
ED:
They
were
scared?
ED:
Janet?
What
about
Janet?

When
it
comes
from
your
area,
Janet,
-
JANET:
No.
Now,
I'm
looking
at
Janet.
CREATURE:
Don't
fight
in
here.
ED:
And
the
voice
comes
from
her,
but
her
CREATURE:
Turn
it
off!
I
know...
ED:
Janet,
can
you
tell
when
CREATURE:
No.
No,
I
don't
ever.
ED:
You
know
who
I
am?
CREATURE:
Yeah.
Ed.
Ed!

ED:
Were
you
a
Christian?
CREATURE:
No!
You
know
it!
ED:
What
year
did
you
die?
CREATURE:
Yeah.
I'm
dead.
Sixty-one.
JANET:
Nineteen
sixty-one.
