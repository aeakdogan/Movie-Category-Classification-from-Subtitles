You
OK,
Tina?
Just
a
dream,
Ma.
Some
dream,
judging
from
that.
You
coming
back
Hold
your
horses.
Tina,
honey,
you
got
or
you
got
to
stop
One
or
the
other.
One...two...
Freddy's
coming
for
you.
Three...four...
Better
lock
your
door.
Five...six...
Grab
your
crucifix.
Seven...eight...
Gonne
stay
up
late.
Nine...ten...
Never
sleep
again...
It
was
so
scary.
When
I
woke
up...
it
seemed
like
he
was
still
Sounds
like
a
real
bogeyman.
"One...two...
That's
what
it
reminded
me
of--
It
was
You
wouldn't
believe
it.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
had
I
had
a
hard-on
this
morning
Had
your
name
There's
four
letters
How
could
there
be
room
Hey!
Up
yours
Rod
says
the
sweetest
things.
He's
nuts
about
you.
Yeah,
nuts.
Anyway...
I
couldn't
go
back
So,
what
did
you
dream?
Forget
it,
Tina.
The
point
is
that
everyone
has
It's
no
biggie.
Next
time
you're
having
one,
that's
all
it
is
Once
you
do
that,
At
least,
it
works
for
me.
Did
you
have
a
nightmare,
too?
Maybe
we're
going
They
say
things
get
I'm
so
glad
you
guys
When
my
mom
said
she
was
taking
No
problem,
Tina.
I
can't
believe
his
mother's
Right,
well...she's
not
exactly.
See,
I
got
this
cousin
It's
OK
for
me
And
I
got
this
Hello,
Mom?
Yeah.
Out
here
at
Barry's.
Yeah,
noisy
as
usual.
Glad
we
don't
live
here,
huh?
Aunt
Eunice
says
hello.
I'll
call
you
in
the
morning.
Yeah,
sure--
Just
some
kids
drag
racing
Listen,
Mom.
I
got
to
go.
I
think
there's
been
All
right,
I'll
call
the
police.
I'll
call
the
police!
Just
some
neighbours
having
I'm
fine.
I'll
call
you
in
the
morning.
It
worked
like
a
charm.
Smooth.
Jesus.
See?
I
told
you
All
day
long
I've
been
seeing
and
hearing
those
fingernails.
Fingernails?
That's
amazing
you
saying
that.
That
made
me
remember
What
did
you
dream?
I
dreamed
about
a
guy
in
What
about
the
fingernails?
He
scraped
his
fingernails
Actually,
they
were
more
like
something
he
made
himself.
But
they
made
a
horrible
sound.
It
was
like...
You
dreamed
That's
impossible.
What?
Nothing.
There's
something
out
there,
I
didn't
hear
anything.
I
heard
something.
I'm
going
to
punch
out
Kitty,
kitty.
Chow,
chow,
chow?
It's
Rod
Lane
just
three
yards
What
a
brilliant
tackle,
What
the
hell
Came
to
make
up.
No
big
deal.
Your
mom
home?
Of
course.
What's
that?
Intense,
huh?
What's
going
on
here,
Maybe
a
funeral,
dickhead.
It's
just
Tina
and
me.
Did
you
see
his
face?
Your
mom
isnt
home,
is
she?
Me
and
Tina
We
got
her
mother's
bed.
You
guys
got
the
rest.
I
think
we
should
You
guys
are
going
Don't
leave
me
alone
Please,
Nancy?
Glen,
not
now.
We're
here
for
Tina
now,
Why
is
she
so
bothered
Because
he
was
scary,
Morality
sucks.
I
knew
there
was
something
You
feel
better
now?
Jungle
man
fix
Jane.
No
more
fights?
No
more
fights.
No
more
nightmares
When
did
you
have
a
nightmare?
Guys
can
have
nightmares,
too,
You
isnt
got
a
corner
Who
do
you
think
you
are?
Whoever
you
are.
Somebody
there?
Who
the
hell
is
that?
Shit.
Please,
God--
This...
is
God.
Watch
this.
Nancy!
Open
the
door!
Rod,
help
me!
Help
me,
Rod!
Who
did
this?
I'll
kill
you!
Who
did
this?
You
scared
me!
What
have
you
got?
Her
name
was
Tina
Gray.
Father
abandoned,
10
years
ago.
Mother's
in
Vegas
We're
trying
to
reach
her
now.
What's
the
coroner
got?
Something
like
a
razor
but
nothing
was
found
It
looks
like
Lieutenant,
where
is
she?
I
put
her
in
your
office.
His
name's
Rod
Lane.
He's
a
musician
type.
He's
been
arrested
for
drugs,
Terrific.
What
the
hell
was
she
She
lived
there.
I
don't
mean
her.
I
mean
you.
What
was
she
doing
there?
Hello
to
you,
too,
Donald.
Marge.
OK.
How
you
doing,
baby?
I'm
OK,
Dad.
Look,
I
don't
want
to
get
God
knows
you
need
time.
But
I
sure
would
like
to
know
shacking
up
with
three
kids
especially
a
lunatic
Rod
is
not
a
lunatic,
Dad.
You
have
a
sane
explanation
Apparently,
Nancy
said
they'd
had
a
fight.
It
wasn't
that
serious.
Maybe
you
don't
think
How
can
you
say
I
don't
Look,
all
I
meant...
was
that
their
fights
You
know
Tina
dreamed
What?
She'd
had
a
nightmare
that
That's
why
we
were
there,
Mom.
She
just
didn't
want
Police
say
the
victim,
had
quarrelled
earlier
Lane
is
now
the
subject
The
murder
weapon...
a
straight
razor
or
similar
Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
To
school.
Honey,
you
were
tossing
and
You
have
no
business
I've
got
to
go
to
school,
Otherwise,
I'll
sit
up
there
Did
you
sleep?
I'll
sleep
in
study
hall.
I'd
rather
keep
busy.
Right
home
after?
Right
home
after.
See
you.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you!
They're
going
Nobody's
going
to
kill
you.
Did
you
do
it?
I
never
touched
her.
You
were
screaming
like
crazy.
There
was
somebody
else
there.
The
door
was
locked
Don't
look
at
me
I'm
warning
you!
Just
move
away
from
her,
son.
Real
easy,
like
your
ass
Hold
it!
Jesus
Christ!
Hold
it
right
there!
Watch
it!
I'm
cool!
I
got
him.
On
the
ground!
Now!
Come
on!
Get
down!
Lieutenant,
look
at
this!
I
didn't
do
it!
Daddy?
You
used
me.
What
the
hell
were
you
doing...
going
to
school
today
for

he
put
it.
Of
course,

trying
to

Where's
your
pass?
Screw
your
pass.
Hey,
Nancy!
No
running
in
the
hallway.
Who
are
you?
Gonne
get
you.
It's
only
a
dream
!
Come
to
Freddy.
God
damn
you!
OK!
OK!
Thompson!
I'll
call
your
mother.
Everything
is
all
right
now.
Come
on.
Sit
down.
I'm
OK.
I'm
fine.
You
sure?
I'll
go
straight
home.
You'll
need
a
hall
pass.
Back
to
work.
And
then
what
happened?
I
told
you.
It
was
dark,
but
I'm
sure
under
the
covers
with
her.
How
could
somebody
be
under
without
you
knowing
about
it?
How
the
fuck
do
I
know?
I
don't
expect
you
What
did
he
look
like?
Did
you
get
a
look
at
him?
Then
how
do
you
know
Because
somebody
cut
her
And
you
didn't
get
a
look
I
couldn't
even
see
the
fucker.
You
could
just
see...
cuts
happening...
all
at
once.
What
do
you
mean
all
at
once?
It
was
as
if
cutting
her
at
the
same
time...
but
invisible
ones.
You
know,
I
probably
if
I'd
have
moved
sooner.
But
I
thought
it
was
Like
the
one
I
had
There
was
this
guy.
He
had
knives
for
fingers.
You
think
I
did
it?
One...two...
Freddy's
coming
for
you.
Three...four...
Better
lock
your
door.
Five...six...
Grab
your
crucifix.
Seven...eight...
Gonne
stay
up
late.
Nine...ten...
Never
sleep...again.
What,
Mother?
Don't
fall
asleep
in
there.
You
could
drown,
you
know.
Oh,
for
Pete's
sakes.
It
happens
all
the
time.
I've
heated
up
Warm
milk?
Gross.
Help!
Hold
on,
baby!
Mom
!
I'm
OK.
-You're
OK?
But
I
heard
you
screaming.
I
just
slipped
getting
out
But
I
told
you...
hundreds
of
people
a
year
I
know,
but
I'm
OK,
Mother.
I'm
sorry
for
scaring
you.
I'll
turn
down
your
bed.
I'll
get
my
pyjamas
on.
...the
act
of
I'm
sorry.
I
thought
I'd
see
how
you
were.
Sometimes
I
wish
you
didn't
live
Will
you
shut
up
and
let
me
in?
Did
you
ever
stand
on
a
trellis
Get
inside
before
I
hit
my
head.
Got
to
be
quiet.
If
you
don't
mind.
So,
I
heard
you
freaked
out
Yeah,
I
guess
I
did.
You
haven't
slept
yet,
have
you?
Not
really.
What
did
you
do
to
your
arm?
I
burned
it
in
English
class.
Oh,
God.
I
look
20
years
old.
Did
you
have
Slept
like
a
rock.
Do
you
believe
that
people...
can
dream
about
No.
Do
you
believe
in
the
bogeyman?
No.
Rod
killed
Tina,
I've
got
a
crazy
favour
It's
nothing
hard
or
anything.
I'm
going
to
go
and
look
and
I
want
you
to
stand...
Now,
you
can't
mess
up.
A
lot
might
depend
on
this.
I
won't
screw
up.
Turn
off
the
light.
Here's
what
we're
going
to
do.
It's
dark
in
here.
And
it's
not
Are
you
still
watching?
Yeah.
So?
I'm
just
checking.
Watch
out!
Watch
out!
Wake
up!
Are
you
there?
I'm
here.
Nancy,
help
me,
please.
Save
me
from--
Freddy!
This
is
just
a
dream.
This
isn't
real.
This
is
just
a
dream.
He
isn't
real.
Glen,
you
bastard.
What
did
I
do?
I
just
just
stay
awake
and
watch
me...
just
wake
me
up
if
it
looked
and
what
did
you
do?
You
shit.
You
fell
asleep.
Oh,
shit.
Hurry.
Shut
up
and
stay
there.
Are
you
OK?
Yeah.
It
was
just
I'm
going
right
back
to
sleep.
Call
me
if
you
need
anything.
You
mind
telling
me
Just
come
on.
Garcia,
I've
got
to
see
You
know,
so
I
could
get
It's
urgent!
We
have
reason
to
believe
something
very
strange
Got
no
argument
with
that.
What
are
you
doing
here?
There's
an
unsolved
murder...
and
I
don't
like
especially
ones
that
What
are
you
doing
here?
At
this
hour,
I
just
want
to
see
if
he's
OK.
Nancy,
take
my
word
for
it.
The
guy's
sleeping
like
a
baby.
He's
not
going
anywhere.
Just
go
down
and
look
at
him.
Please,
Daddy.
All
right.
Garcia,
give
me
the
keys.
Right.
Where
the
hell
Help!
Help!
Jesus!
Cut
him
down.
Grab
his
legs.
I
got
him.
Grab
his
back,
would
you?
Lower
him.
Ashes
to
ashes...
Dust
to
dust.
May
God
be
His
life
and
his
death...
attest
to
that
he
who
lives
by
the
sword
But
let
us
recall
also
that
we
judge
not,
And
may
Rod
Lane
rest
in
peace.
Time
to
go,
honey.
Hop
in.
The
killer's
still
loose,
You're
saying
somebody
else
Who?
I
don't
know
who
he
is...
but
he's
burned,
and
a
red
and
green
sweater,
and
he
uses
these
knives,
You
better
keep
her
home
until
she
really
gets
I've
got
something
better.
I'm
going
to
get
her
some
help.
I
don't
see
why
you
couldn't
to
keep
me
from
dreaming.
Everyone's
got
to
dream,
If
you
don't
dream,
you
go.
All
set.
Please,
Nancy,
trust
us.
It's
not
you
I
don't
trust.
Let's
do
it.
Thank
you,
nurse.
How
long
has
this
been
going
on?
Since
the
murders.
She
was
fine
before
that.
Now
she
thinks
There's
no
sign
I'd
guess
that
what
we
have
who
happens
to
have
gone
She's
asleep
now.
Thank
God.
What
the
hell
are
dreams
anyway?
Mysteries.
Incredible
body
hocus-pocus.
The
truth
is
we
still
or
where
they
come
from.
She's
going
into
deep
sleep
now.
Heart
rate
is
a
little
high.
It's
just
due
to
anxiety.
Otherwise,
she's
nicely
relaxed.
All
signs
are
normal.
She
could
dream
at
any
time
now.
Beta
waves
are
slowing.
She's
into
REMs
now.
She's
definitely
dreaming
now.
It's
a
good
one,
too.
Typical
dream
parameter.
A
nightmare
now
would
be
She's
about
three.
Doctor,
what's
she
doing
now?
Is
she
asleep
or
awake?
Something's
wrong.
What's
she
doing?
I
don't
know.
Is
she
dreaming?
Nancy,
it's
Mom
!
What?
Her
hair.
Excuse
me.
This'll
help
you
sleep.
Oh,
my
God,
her
arm
!
Get
something.
What
happened,
baby?
What
happened?
It's
OK.
I
brought
something
out
Where
did
you
get
that?
I
grabbed
it
off
his
head.
She
said
she
grabbed
it
off
No,
I'm
not
crazy.
I'm
holding
the
damn
thing
I
don't
know
where
I
got
to
go.
You
didn't
sleep
at
all
You
know
the
doctor
says
I'll
go
even
crazier?
I
don't
think
you're
crazy.
And
stop
drinking
So,
did
you
ask
Daddy
I
threw
that
filthy
thing
away.
I
don't
know
or
what
you're
trying
to
prove.
What
I
learned
that's
what
I'm
trying
Rod
didn't
kill
Tina,
It's
this
guy.
He's
after
us
in
our
dreams.
That's
just
not
reality,
Nancy.
It's
real,
Mama.
Feel
it.
Give
me
that
damn
thing.
It
even
has
his
name
Fred
Krueger,
Mom.
Do
you
know
who
that
is,
Mother?
Because
if
you
do,
because
he's
after
me
now.
Nancy,
trust
your
mother
You'll
feel
better
Feel
better?
You
call
this
feeling
better?
Or
maybe
I
should
grab
that
Avoid
everything
happening
to
me
Fred
Krueger
He's
dead.
Believe
me.
I
know.
You
knew
about
him
and
you've
been
acting
like
Nancy,
you're
sick.
There's
something
wrong
You're
imagining
things.
You'll
feel
better
It's
just
as
simple
as
that.
Screw
sleep!
It's
just
a
nightmare.
That's
enough.
Whenever
I
get
nervous,
I
eat.
And
if
you
can't
do
that,
I
used
to.
Not
anymore.
Did
you
ever
read
about
They
got
this
whole
system
So
if
you
have
a
nightmare,
Right.
Well,
instead
of
screaming
you
say,
"I'm
going
"that
I
fall
Make
it
something
special
They
get
all
their
art
Just
wake
up
and
write
it
down.
Dream
skills.
What
if
they
meet
a
monster
They
turn
their
back
on
it.
Take
away
its
energy,
But
what
happens
Then
I
guess
those
people
don't
Great.
"Booby
Traps

Improvised
What
are
you
reading
that
for?
I'm
into

See
ya.
You're
starting
to
scare
me.
Oh,
gross.
Mother!
What's
with
the
bars?
Security.
Security
from
what?
Not
from
what,
from
whom.
Come
down
to
the
cellar
with
me,
You
want
to
know
He
was
who
killed
at
least
20
kids
Kids
we
all
knew.
Oh,
Mom.
It
drove
us
crazy
when
we
but
it
was
even
worse
Did
they
put
him
away?
The
lawyers
got
fat

somebody
forgot
in
the
right

and
Krueger
was
free
What
did
you
do,

out.
We
found
him
in

on.
We
took
gasoline...
We
poured
it
and
made
a
trail
of
it
then
lit
the
whole
thing
up
But
he
can't
get
you
now.
He's
dead,
honey,
I
even
took
his
knives.
So
it's
OK
now.
You
can
sleep.
Oh,
hi,
how
you
doing?
Fine.
Stand
by
your
window
You
sound
a
million
miles
away.
That's
much
better.
I
see
your
mom
went
ape
You
look
like
the
Prisoner
How
long's
it
been
It's
coming
up
It's
OK.
I
checked
Guinness.
The
record's
11.
Listen,
Glen,
I
know
who
he
is.
Who?
The
killer.
-You
do?
And
if
he
gets
me,
Why
would
anybody
Don't
ask.
Just
give
me
some
help
when
I
bring
him
out.
Bring
him
out
of
what?
My
dream.
How
do
you
plan
to
do
that?
Just
like
I
did
the
hat.
Have
a
hold
of
the
sucker
Wait
a
minute.
You
can't
bring
somebody
If
I
can't,
because
it's
just
a
case
I
can
save
you
the
trouble.
You're
nutty
as
a
fruitcake.
I
love
you
anyway.
Good.
Then
you
won't
mind
when
I
bring
him
out.
What?
You
heard
me.
I
grab
the
guy
in
my
dream.
You
see
me
struggling,
We
both
come
out,
you
whack
Are
you
crazy?
You're
the
jock.
You
have
a
baseball
bat
Just
meet
me
at
my
porch
Oh,
and
meanwhile...
Meanwhile?
Whatever
you
do,
Midnight?
Oh,
man.
Midnight.
Baseball
bats
and
bogeymen.
Beautiful.
Honey?
How
can
you
listen
and
hear
your
records
Oh,
I
wasn't
listening
Just
watching.
Miss
Nude
America
How
can
you
hear
Who
cares
what
she
says?
Don't
be
such
a
smart
guy.
I
want
you
to
go
to
bed.
It's
almost
midnight.
Goodness
knows
we've
all
these
last
few
days.
I
will,
Mom.
You
guys
turning
in?
Pretty
soon.
Now
get
to
bed.
It's
over
now,
baby.
The
nightmare's
over.
Please.
You
shouldn't
stare.
You
know
what
I
think?
I
think
that
kid
You
shouldn't
talk
that
way
You
mean
those
bars?
Marge
is
just
being
cautious
and
Nancy
I
don't
care
what
you
say.
I
don't
want
that
kid
hanging
Glen,
answer
the
phone.
Just
a
minute.
It's
her.
About
what?
What's
this
about,
Nancy?
Just
a
minute.
She
says
it's
private.
Very
private
and
very
important.
Give
me
that.
Glen's
asleep.
You'll
have
You've
just
got
to
be
firm
Let's
go.
As
a
matter
of
fact...
Damn.
Don't
fall
asleep.
Oh,
brilliant.
What
if
Glen
tries
to
call?
I'm
your
boyfriend
now,
Nancy.
My
boyfriend.
Mom

Locked,
locked,
locked,
locked.
I
locked
it
all
up.
I
had
to.
Nancy,
you
are
going
if
it
kills
me.
Give
me
the
key,
Mother.
I
can't.
I
don't
Damn

It
is
now
12
midnight...

Help,
Mom

Frank.
You

You'll
need
a

Don't
tell
me
it's
another
one.
Lieutenant
Thompson,
but
I've
never
seen
anything
And
I
knew
so
I
thought
I'd
better
The
coroner's
upstairs
now,
Oh,
my
God.
I'll
get
him
right
away.
Lieutenant,
it's
your
daughter.
Hi,
Daddy.
I
know
what
happened.
I
haven't
been
upstairs
yet.
But
you
know
he's
dead,
right?
Yeah.
Apparently
he's
dead.
Listen,
Daddy,
Listen
very
carefully,
please.
I'm
going
to
go
and
get
and
I
want
you
to
be
there
when
I
bring
him
out,
OK?
Just
tell
me
who
did
it.
Fred
Krueger
did
it,
Daddy...
and
only
I
can
get
him.
It's
my
nightmare
he
comes
to.
Just
come
here
in
exactly
20
minutes.
Can
you
do
that?
Yeah,
sure.
That'll
be
exactly
Time
enough
for
me
Honey,
you
just
do
that.
Get
yourself
some
sleep.
That's
what
I've
been
But
you'll
be
here
to
catch
him?
Lieutenant,
they're
waiting
Sure,
I'll
be
there,
sweetheart.
You

yourself
Deal?
I
love
you,
sweetheart.
Go
outside
If
you
see
anything
funny,
Anything

One
thing
for
sure,
I
don't
She's
too
far
gone
What
the
hell
did
that,
I
don't
know.
What
has
the
coroner
got
to
say?
He's
in
the
john
puking
I
guess
I
should
have
Just
get
some

Mom.
It's
going
to
be
OK.
I
was
just
trying
I
didn't
see
how

That's

That's

baby.
Night.
OK,
Krueger.
We
play
on
your
court.
And
now
I
lay
me
down

I

and
if
I
die
before
I
wake...
I
pray
the
Lord
my
soul
to

Ten
minutes
and
counting.
What
if

They

Where

Parker,
I
need
some
help
here!
OK,

guys.
Let's

Get

Open
this
door!
Watch
yourself.
I

it.
It's
Krueger!
Get
out
of
the
way.
This
way,

Come
down
here.
Oh,
my
God.
Nancy,

hell
Parker,
get
up
here!
We
got
a
fire
up
here,
too.
We're
on
our
way
up.
What
the
hell
is
going
on,
He's
after

Watch

Now
do
you
believe
me?
They've
got
the
fires
out
Everything
OK
up
here?
I'm
OK.
You
go
downstairs.
I'll
be
there
in
a
minute.
Lieutenant,
I
don't
know.
I
know
you're
there,
Freddy.
You
think
you
was
I
know
you
too
well
now,
Now
you
die.
It's
too
late,
Krueger.
I
know
the
secret
now.
This
is
just
a
dream.
You're
not
alive.
This
whole
thing
I
want
You
what?
I
take
back
You're
nothing.
You're
shit.
It's
bright.
It's
going
to
burn
off
soon,
Feeling
better?
Oh,
I
feel
like
a
million
bucks.
They
say
you've
bottomed
out...
when
you
can't
remember
You
know,
baby,
I
just
don't
feel
like
it
Did
I
keep
you
awake
last
night?
You
look
a
little
bit
peaked.
I
guess
I
just
slept
heavy.
I'll
see
you.
See
you.
Hi,
everybody.
You
believe
this
fog?
I
believe
anything
is
possible.
Looking
good,
girl.
What
happened?
What's
going
on?
Hey,
I'm
not
doing
this.
Let
us
out!
I'm
not
doing
this.
What's
going
on
with
the
window?
No!
Mother!
What's
going
on?
One,
two...
Freddy's
coming
for
you.
Three,
four...
Better
lock
your
door.
Five,
six...
Grab
your
crucifix.
Seven,
eight...
Gonne
stay
up
late.
Nine,
ten...
Never
sleep
again.
