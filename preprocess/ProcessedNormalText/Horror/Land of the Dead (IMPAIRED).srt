What
do
you
want,
Mr.

You
might
have
noticed
that
so
I
didn't
get
a
chance
I'd
like
you
to
handle
With
interest:
$5
million.
Or
I'm
gonna
blow
you
Because
I
got
Dead
Reckoning.
That's
unfortunate.
Well,
unfortunate
for
you,
I
want
you
to

send
it

Where
are

You
take
care
of

pulled
me
out
of

fire.
It
was
bad.

can
get
close
enough
