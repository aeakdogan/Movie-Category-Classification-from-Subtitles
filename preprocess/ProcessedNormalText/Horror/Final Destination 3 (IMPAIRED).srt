are

doing

I
could've
I
didn't

I
wondered
if
maybe
Spirit
or
presence
or...
Whatever.

if
there's
any
place
like
there's
It's
a
cemetery.
Yeah,
I
haven't
felt
And
I've
tried.
Real
hard.
Heh.
I
thought
maybe
That
night...Before
Jason
said--
God,
and
it
was
just
he
said...
"Your
fear
is
from
a
sense
And
I've
felt
that
fear
Even
thought
it
maybe
somehow
but
this
fear
is
more
It's
like
a
presence.
Like
a
living
thing
You
think
it's
J?
No,
I
know
it's
not.
This
presence
is
the
opposite
It's
cold

the
last
photograph

photographic
plate
causing
a
line

where
WENDY:

flight
180
disaster.
Look,

you
came
because
I'm
responsible
for
with
the
And
it
did
happen,
and
but
you
can't
believe
because
you're
desperate
I
took
these.
That
night.
These?
Are
these
it?
Oh,
shit.
Oh...Shit.

Whoa,
whoa,
hey.
I'm
feeling
When
was
I
don't
remember.

the
order
if
they'd
have
Ok?
So
if
this
Then
Frankie
was
behind
When
I
saw
Ashley
I
felt
this
instinct.
Like
there
was
a
hint
I
even
called
to
see
if
Well,
what's
Frankie's
It's
right
here.
You
got
it?
Wait!
Watch
out!
Hey!
Hey!
Are
you
crazy?
Sorry!
WENDY:
All
right,
And
go
through
I
don't
want
anyone
hearing
Well,
it's
nice
to
see
that
any
less
of
a
control
freak.
You
got
it?
Here's
Frank's
All
right.
Well,
this
is
obvious.
A
rope
ladder,
though.
Look,

could
there
be

Oh,
