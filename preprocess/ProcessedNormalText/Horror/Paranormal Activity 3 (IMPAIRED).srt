DENNIS:
He's
hungry?
Kristi,
Toby

RANDY:
Okay,

Hey.
Whoa.

Where
were
you?
What
happened?
-
Hey.
-
I'm
really
sorry.
I
had
a
leak
in
the
house.
I
had
a
leak
in
the
ceiling
here.
-
Really?
RANDY:
It
didn't
rain
last
night.
Hold
this
for
a
second.
I
need
your
help.
It's
been
going
like
crazy.
-
so
I
got
that
pole
there.
-
What?
I
don't
know.
I
think
it's
maybe
Anyway,
I
gotta
get
some
spackle.
-
Wait,
you
just
want
me

You
want
me
to
wait
here
and
hold
it?
Wait,
Dennis.
Dennis!

Hey.
Hey.
No.
Why
don't
you
come
on
in
KATIE:
No.

Are
you
serious?
You

listen
to
Who

GIRLS:

KATIE:
I
have
a
new
trick
to
show
you.
Guys,
come
on.

Hurry,
hurry,

It
better
be

We
were
playing
outside.

GIRLS:
A

We've
got
a
cute
little
spider.
-
Come

GIRLS:
Do

KATIE:
It

spider.
That
really
hurt.

Yep.

Okay...
DENNIS:
Here
it
goes.
All
right.
-
ALL:
Cheese.

MAN:
Thanks,
sweetheart.
-
Randy?
Where
did
you
find
this
girl?
I
don't
know.
I
didn't
see
her

-
That's
because
I'm
so
happy...
I
love
my
job,
man.
-
I
should've
got
her
number.
Randy,
this
is
great
stuff.



DENNIS:
Jule?

Julie?
There
it
goes
again.
DENNIS:
Hello?
Julie?


TEDDY:
I
like
this
song!
Not
bad.
Mmm,
that's
pretty
good.
Teddy?
Did
you
fall
down?


DENNIS:
What
was
that?

Oh.

-
Hey.
What
you
doing?
Nothing.
I
was
just
looking
around.
What...
What...
-
Yeah.
-
It
was
girls'
day.
-
Was
it
fun?

You
just
really
snuck
up

DENNIS:
All
right.
It's
time.
-
Don't
film
this.
It's
illegal.
-

We
haven't
even
started
smoking
it,
It's
illegal.
-
Now
relax.
Seriously,
Julie.

Let's
get
really
serious.
-
Shut
up.
-
All
right.
Whoa.
That
was
big.

Julie,
do
the
voice.

Dennis.
-

What
voice?
This
voice?
Dennis,
I
can't
believe

DENNIS:

Shut
up.
I
want
to
film
us
having
sex.
Is
that
perverted?
-
Is
that
weird?
Was
that
a
yes?
Okay.
-
Really?
-
Hey,
there,
pretty
lady.
Oh,
stop.
I
don't
know.
You
sure...
You
sure
you're
up
for
this?
No.
You
know
what?
Don't
answer
that.
Hurry
up,
before
I
change
my
mind.
Oh,
okay,
sorry.
-


What
are
you
doing?
What
was
that?
-
It's
porno
music.
Great.
Classy.
Mmm.
Good
start.
Good,
right?
-
All
right.
Mmm.



Relax.
Just
relax.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Hey.
-
Yeah.
I'm
okay.

-
Yeah,
what
is
that?
Whoa!

It's
an
earthquake.
-
Holy
shit!
The
girls.
The
girls!
Come
on!
Dennis!

JULIE:
Dennis.
Oh,
my
God,
I
look
so
fat.
DENNIS:
You
don't
look
fat.
-
Look
at
the
size
of
me
on
top
of
you.
You
look
like
you
can't
breathe
I
want
another
shot
-
Watch
this.
Julie,
watch,
watch,
watch.
-
See
that?
Did
you
see
that
in
the
corner?
Yeah,
I
see,
like,
dust.
-
Dirt
falling.
There's
something
there.
-
You
are
crazy.
Wait,
you
can
see
something
there.
It's
very
cute,
You're
like
one
of
those
people
Like
when
people
think
-
That's
you
right
now.
This
has
to
be
erased
I'm
sorry.
I'm
late.
I
got
to
go.
You
know,
Doubt
it.
I
don't
think
you
can
go
a
day

Don't
dare
me.
-
Erase
it.
-
Sorry,
sorry,
sorry,
sorry.
Dude,
what
are
you
doing,
man?
I
know,
it's
my
car!
I
got
the
earthquake.
-
Did
you
really?
It's
scary,
right?
Is
that
Julie?
It's
nothing,
it's
nothing.
-
We're
going
to...
Yeah.
I
got...
She
let
you
make
a
sex
tape?
Yeah,
but
it
got
interrupted
I
wouldn't
have
let
Relax,
man,
just
relax.
-
Let
me
slow-mo
shuttle
forward.
DENNIS:
Check
this
out.
Ready?
All
right,
let
me
tweak
the
contrast
here.
Okay.
I'm
gonna
take
the
color
out.
It
looks
like
dust
is
falling
on
something.
It
looks
like
a
figure,
right?
-
You
see
that?
Did
you
catch
that?
-
Yeah,
it
moved.
-
It
moved,
right?
I
don't
know.
Check
it
out.
-
It's
weird,
right?
You
know,
I've
been
hearing
I
don't
know.
I
feel
like
it's...
Something
weird's
going
on.
-
DENNIS:
Julie?
Hey,
um,
I
wanted
to
talk
to
you...

Dennis!
Oh,
sorry!
Sorry.
Oh,
my
God!

Sorry.
You
mind
if
I
set
up
I'm
not
going
to
talk
to
you
right
now.
Okay,
I'll...
I'll
take
that
as
a
yes?
-
I
hate
you!
KATIE:
How
long
do
the
tapes
last?
DENNIS:
About
six
hours
each.
So
you
have
to
change
Mmm,
yes.
Katie,
can
you
hop
out
of
the
frame?
-
Okay.
Is
that
good?
Keep
going.
-
KATIE:
Can
I
see
it?
Here.
Come
here.
See
it?
Yeah.
-
Pretty
cool,
right?
So,
what
are
you
trying
to
see?
Uh,
anything
unusual
or
strange.
Oh,
no,
it's
not
that.
-
Kristi?
Don't
touch
the
camera
or
anything.
Katie,
just
leave
it
alone.

-
Dennis.
Really?
Don't
you
think
This
is
a
new
house.
It
shouldn't
be
making
these
noises.
Not
just
in
here.
No...
This
is
not
gonna
work
here.
Like,
what
do
you
think
Whatever's
in
our
house.
Oh,
right,
'cause
there's
Well,
there's
definitely
something.
I...
I
feel
it.
JULIE:
Yeah,
I
feel
something,
too.
I
feel
a
camera.
The
earthquake,
and
all
those...
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know,
I
just...
No,
it's
totally
normal.

Bye,
camera.
Good
night,
camera.



Yeah?
Yeah,
probably.
In
their
bedroom.
Be
quiet,
so
we
don't
wake
Katie
up.

It's
okay.
Why?
Oh.
Yeah,
kind
of.
He's
very
sweet.
Yeah,
I
saw
that.
I
watched
some
of
the
tapes
and
I
saw
you
If
you
saw
me
talking
to
somebody,

Toby's
your
friend?
Yes.
He's
my
friend.
Yeah,
what
do
you
guys
talk
about?
Mmm,
secrets.
-
He's
big?
So,
is
he
old,
like
Grandma,
or
is
he
young,
like
you?
He's
old,
like
Grandma.
And
what
does
he
look
like?
Is
he
tall?
Is
he
fat?
He's
tall.
He's
tall.
Don't
call
him
fat.
Kristi,
when
you
say
that
that
you'll
be
in
trouble
with
Toby,
Well,
I
won't
be
safe.
He's
gonna...
No.
But
I
won't
be
safe.
That
means,
I
will
be,
like...
Be
in
very,
very
big
trouble.
Big
trouble.
DENNIS:
You
saw
her.
It
was
like
he
was
actually
there,
right?
I
know.
Because
that's
how
active
It's
crazy.
I
mean,
imagination
is
one
thing.
She
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
I
mean,
it's
a
little
odd
You
haven't
been
around
kids
They...
Katie
used
to
get
up
and
she
used
to
sleep
on
the
toilet.

What?
Okay?
I'm
serious.
Really?
Yes.
Toby
is
a
phase
and
he's
going
to
I
know
it.
RANDY:
How
many
hours
of
footage
This
is
the
job,
man.
I
got
two
cameras,
six
hours
each.
Twelve
hours.
-
Twelve
hours
of
footage?
-
I'm
seriously
gonna
review
it.
Yes.
Now,
please,
That's
so
stupid.
-
RANDY:
Hey,
Julie.
DENNIS:
Um...
Good.
You
want
to
step
into
my
office
No.
You
find
anything?
RANDY:
Yes,
actually.
We
found
that
Very
funny,
Randy.
-
Keep
up
the
good
work.
I
love
you
with
all
of
my
heart
and
soul.
I
love
you,
too.

either
be
called
RANDY:
Present.
Back
to
the
Present.
-
No,
no.
-
That
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Let's
Get
Back
to
the
Present,
maybe.
But
Back
to
the
Past...
-
Back
to
the
Present.

-
You
hear
that?

-
Was
that...
That's
it.
It's
happening
again.
Come
on.


-
Did
you
hear
that?

RANDY:


-

Are
you
getting
that?
-
Are
you
getting
it?
-

RANDY:
Holy
shit!

Holy
shit!
That's
not
funny.

-
RANDY:
Oh,
my
God.
You're
both
crazy.
-
Oh,
oh,
I
got
you.
I
got
you
good.
Just
go
ahead
'cause
I
nearly
crapped
my
pants.
Holy
fuck!
-
Oh,
my
God,
get
away!
-
Get
away
from
me.
Get
away.
I
hate
you.

Girls?

Dennis.
Dennis?

Don't
do
that
to
me.
-
Sorry,
sorry,

Did
you
check
on
them?
Why
is
this
door
locked?
What's
the
matter?
JULIE:
We're
just
checking
on

guys.
Move

light.
We're

me
a
favor?
LOIS:
Where's
Dennis?
Uh,
he's
out,
buying
more
tapes.
With
your
credit
card?
Mom.
He
doesn't
have
any
money.
That
is
not
true.
The
girls
love
him.
I
mean,
they
just
about
think
I
mean,
I
really,
really
do
like
him.
It's
just
that
the
girls
miss
their
father.
I
don't
know.
I
wish
he
were
He
is
financially
secure,
Mom.
-
He
shoots
wedding
videos.
-
He
has
his
own
business.
You
know?
It's
a
whole
different
thing.
My
God,
Mom.
I
just
told
you,
I
don't
want
to
have
any
more
kids.
I'm
not
gonna
get
pregnant.
You
always
said
I
changed
my
mind,
okay?
-
You
always
wanted
a
son.
I'm
happy
with
the
way
things
are.

DENNIS:
What
the...
Fuck.

DENNIS:
Oh,
this
is
great.
Hang
on.
That's
great!
Katie,
that's
great.
-
Thank
you.
RANDY:
Dennis,
I
totally
DENNIS:
Randy,
watch
the
language.
All
right,
nice
and
slow.
My
brother
saw
one
once.
-
DENNIS:
Really?
What's
Bloody
Mary?
You
don't
know
what
Bloody
Mary
is?
It's,
uh,
where
you
go
in
the
bathroom
and
you
say
"Bloody
Mary"
three
times
KATIE:
Dennis,
DENNIS:
Nothing,
don't
worry.
You
say
Bloody
Mary
three
times.
Ooh,
I
want
to
play!
I'm
just
saying
you're
missing
without
cameras
down
there.
DENNIS:
I
know.
Like
put
it
up
in
the
corner,
like,
It
just
doesn't
work.
It
just...
It's
not
a
wide
enough
angle.
And
I
don't
even...
-
Mirrors.
You
could
use
mirrors.
-
RANDY:
This
thing
is
so
cool.
It's
awesome.
Wow!
Look,
you
got
it
-

I
got
to
work
out
some
kinks.

Oh,
man.

-
JULIE:
Hi.
What
is
that?
Check
it
out.
My
new
thing.
-
It's
pretty
cool,
right?
-
What...
What
is
it?
And
basically,
took
apart...
Basically,
the
oscillator
both
in
the
living
room
Cool.
Wait,
what?
You
broke
my
fan?
I
can
put
it
back
together.
Okay,
MacGyver.
-
It's
cool,
right?
This
way
I
can...






Kristi,
what
are
you
doing?
-
Nothing.
Hey,
babe,
what
are
you
doing
up
here?
Painting.
Don't
you
want
to
play
outside?
Not
really.
How
about
your
friend
Toby?
Yeah.
Did
he
wake
you
up?
Mmm,
no.
Did
he
tell
you
to
come
downstairs?
No.
You
know
you
can
tell
me,
right?
He
told
me
not
to
talk
about
it.
Why
don't
you
just
ask
him
yourself?
He's
standing
right
next
to
you.
I
don't
see
him.
He's
there.
DENNIS:
Hey,
thanks
for
RANDY:
Yeah,
of
course.
-
This
is
good
stuff.
-
Randy...
Did
you
check
this
out?
No,
I
don't
have
a
library
card.
You
stole
these?
I
didn't
steal
them,
Dennis.
You
told
me
to
get
the
books,
It's
what
a
library
is.
It's
for
borrowing.
That's
what
"library"
It
means,
"Borrow
book
store."
Malevolent
Entities.
What
is
this
one?
Uh,
I
don't
know.
It
had
some
creepy
pictures...
This
stuff
is
creepy.
Oh,
hey.
It's
your
sister
and
her
friends.
Is
that
a
joke?
Playing
field
hockey.
Says,
"Kids
are
susceptible
Okay.
And?
Well,
the
whole
thing
Remember,
I
was
telling
you
only
when
she
started
talking
I
mean,
it
must
want
something.
You
know,
that's
what
the
book
says.
They
don't
just
stick
around
What
does
it
want?
Well,
the
book
says
KATIE:
Hey,
Kristi.
-
Kristi.
-
Wanna
play
a
game?
Here.
What
are
you
doing?
-
Playing
with
my
soccer
ball?
Kristi,
that's
mine.
Kristi!
Kristi,
come
on.
Kristi,
come
help
me.
What
are
we
doing?
-
We're
gonna
play
Bloody
Mary.
Because
I
wanna
try
to
catch
the
ghost.
Okay.
I
think
it's
on.
So,
how
you
play
is
you
say
and
then
her
dead
body's
-
in
the
mirror
and
try
to
kill
you.
Stop,
Katie.
KRISTI:
So,
now
what
do
we
do?
Shh.
We
have
to
say
"Bloody
Mary".
-
Bloody
Mary.
Bloody
Mary.
-
Kristi,
I
said
three
times,
not
four.
-
I'm
scared,
Katie.

JULIE:
Guys...

My
gosh,
Mom!
-
What
are
you
doing?
Okay.
Grandma
just
got
here.
-
You
moved
his
camera?
-
Is
it
taping?
Yeah.
We
gotta
move
it
'cause
he's
gonna
be
mad.
-
You
guys
wanna
go
to
the
pool?
JULIE:
You
wanna




JULIE:
God
damn
it.

KATIE:
Mom?
DENNIS:
Are
you
okay?
Holy
shit.
KATIE:
Mommy,
what
happened?
-
Stay
upstairs.
Stay
upstairs.
Don't
come
down
here.
-
There's
glass
on
the
floor.
Stay
there.

JULIE:

JULIE:
Looks
fine,
right?
That's
good.
-
DENNIS:
What
happened?
What
do
you
mean,
what
happened?
-
DENNIS:
Hi,
Kristi.
-
Say
hi
to
the
camera.
-
Can
I
join
you
guys?
-
Oh,
I
can?
Okay,
great.
I'm
gonna
set
my
camera
here,
okay?
-
Okay.
Wait.
Why
are
you
filming
this?
Um,
it's
just
like,
and,
you
know,
no
reason.
Don't
sit
there.
That's
Toby's
spot.
Oh,
sorry.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry,
Toby.
-

Does
Teddy
need
help
with
his
tea?
-
Yeah.
Here.
He
can't
reach
'em.
Okay.
Wow.
He
was
thirsty.
See,
I
told
you.

And
she
keeps
falling.
Poke.
So,
Kristi,
what
was
the
last
thing
Oh,
like...
-
Anything?
-
No?
Secrets.
Regular
stuff.
Oh,
in
her
sink?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Oh,
that...
Did
you,
uh...
Did
you...
Did
he
say
something
just
now?
No,
I
just
put
my
hand
on
him.
Oh.

And
he
didn't
like
that.
He
doesn't
like
that,
when
you...
-
No.
Sorry,
Toby.
It
was
a
mistake,
right?
Yeah.

-
What?
-
What?
-
What
were
you
gonna
say?
It's
okay,
you
can
tell
me.
KATIE:
Kristi,
why
is
Because
me
and
Toby
and
he
was
filming
us.
-
I'm
not!
Only
babies
have
imaginary
friends.
He
is
real.

Hey,
Kristi!
Katie,
stop
it!
Well,
you're
being
a
baby!
Only
babies
have
imaginary
friends.
No,
I'm
not!
He's
right
in
there.
In
there?
Toby,
come
out!
Toby,
come
out!
Toby!
Okay,
I'm
gonna
go
in.
Katie,
you
shouldn't
do
that.
Katie!
Don't
go
in
there.

-
You
shouldn't
do
that.
Toby,
come
out.
Toby...
-

Kristi!
What
are
you
doing?
-
Open
the
door!
-

Kristi,
open
this
door!
-
It's
not
me!
-
JULIE:
Girls!
-
What
is
this
yelling?
What
is
going
on?
JULIE:
Stop
fighting
right
this
second.
Why's
Dennis's
camera
on
the
floor?
She
locked
me
in
there.
-
Katie,
you
can't
touch
his
stuff.
Stop
fighting
right
this
second.
-
Mom,
she
locked
me
in
there!
-
Come
on,
come
on.
KRISTI:
Toby
did.
Oh,
yeah,
like
Toby
locked
me
in
there.
KATIE:
She's
gonna
be
here
any
minute.
-

Mommy,
Lisa's
here!
JULIE:
Okay!
KATIE:
Hi,
Lisa.
KATIE:
Good.
KATIE:
I
wanna
show
you
JULIE:
Hi,
Lisa.
Wait,
what
are
you
showing
me?
I
got
some
new
beads
for
my
birthday.
Beads!
Oh,
let's
see
'em.
Hi,
Kristi.
How
are
you?
Hey.
What's
that?
Oh,
don't
mind
this.
You
know
Dennis
and
his
cameras,
Just
ignore
it.
JULIE:
8:30
bedtime?
KATIE:
No,
no,
no,

-
8:30.
Nice
try.
9:30?
-

Bye,
Mommy.

Look,

made
a
triangle.

-
You
ready?
-
Good
night,
girls!
-
See
you
later.


Are
you
tired?
-
Um,
not
really.
Can
you
tell
us
a
story?
Hmm,
sure.
What
kind
of
story?
A
ghost
story.
Ghost
story?
With
a
ghost.
Okay,
um,
let's
think.

I'm
a
ghost!
Hello,
Dennis!
You
found
the
ghost.

Comin'

Got

-
Nothing.
Huh?
Why

Nothing.
Kristi,

It's

-
Is

babysitter?
How

I'll
put
in
a
good
word.

See

I
don't

-
What
is
that?
I'm
telling
you,
it's...
And
she
didn't
say
anything
at
all?
She
left
the
room,
like...
Did
you
show
Julie?
No,
man.
What,
are
you
kidding?
She
would
go
nuts,
and,
you
know,
she'd
make
me
take
I
really
want
to
figure
out
Got
to
keep
taping
this
shit,
I
know.
I
am.
-
You
got
to
keep
taping
this
shit.
She
got
blown
in
the
face.
Yeah,
yeah.






No.
No.
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
anymore.
I'm
going
to
bed.


DENNIS:
What
the...
What
the
fuck?
Hey,
how's
she
feeling?
We
need
to
go
to
the
doctor
Oh,
no.
-
Yeah,
she's
really...
-
Yeah,
it's
bad.
It's
like,
I've
taken
it
a
couple
times.
Do
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
or...
Well,
I
mean,
I
don't
know.
I
can
call
Randy.

Thanks
for
coming
over.

Thanks
again.
All
right,
be
good,
Katie.
See
you.

RANDY:
Hey,
hey.
So
what's
wrong
with
Kristi?
It's
like
a
really
high
fever
Oh.
Is
it
contagious?
I
don't
think
so.
I
haven't
gotten
sick.
Okay,
good.

What
do
you
want
to
do?
Can
we
play
Bloody
Mary?
I
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about.
Seriously?
I
really
don't
think
You
made
a
promise.
-
Can't
we
just
play,
like,
doll
house...
...or
somethin'?

Sorry,
Dennis.
Not
my
idea.
Come
on.
I'm
comin',
I'm
comin'.

So
you
say,
-
Mmm-hmm.
and
then
you
turn
the
lights
back
on
and
then
you're
supposed
and
she's
gonna
try
to
kill
you.
Try
and
kill
you.
Good
game.
-
Yep.
I
don't
know
why
you
wanna
play
this.
One
of
us
is
gonna
be
dead
I
guess
it's
a
one-time
game.
-
Bloody
Mary.
-
Randy!
Nothing
happened.

You
turned
the
light
on
too
soon.
Oh,
come
on,
Katie.
This
is
stupid.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Let's
just
go
play
doll
house
No,
you
didn't
do
it
right.
What
did
I
not
do
right?
You
need
to
keep
the
light
off
longer.
Okay.
Okay.
All
right.
You
wanna
play
Bloody
Mary?
-
Let's
play
Bloody
Mary.
You're
not
gonna

I'm
about
to
play
Bloody
Mary.

Bloody
Mary.

Shh!

Oh,

Huh?
Mmm...
Are
you
okay?

Yeah.
-
Does
it
hurt?
Uh,
I
just
scratched
myself
or
something.
-

Did
you
hear
that?

It's
okay.
Nothing...

Close
the
door.
It's
okay.
It's

I
don't
want
to

it
easy.

What...
What
are
you
doing?
What
does
it
look
like
I'm
doing?
What...
What
are
you

Relax.
Sit
down.
Get
the
camera
out
of
my
face.
I
told
you,
and
then
I
felt
a
claw
Okay,
okay.
Great
interview.
-
No,
Dennis,
I'm
done.
Fuck.
-
Where
are
you
going?
Look
at
the

books.
Casper,
the
fuckin'
friendly
ghost

I'm
sorry

got
hurt.
-
I'm
sorry
you
got
hurt,
okay?
I'm
sorry,
but...
What
are
you
You're
acting
ridiculous.
Relax!
Dennis,
no,
you're
acting
ridiculous
if
you're
not
gonna
get
the
fuck
out.
You
have
to
tell
Julie,
okay?
Just
watch
the
fucking
tape,
Dennis!
-
What's
up?
What?
Um...

I
need
to
talk
to
you.
-
Okay.
Here.
Sit
down,
Jule.
...from
the
'30s.
Look
at
the
necklaces.
That's
crazy.
Yeah?
It's
the
same
symbol.
Isn't
that
the
same
symbol
All
right?
These...
-
Oh,
my
God.
You're
really
something.
I...
I...
I
really
need
to...
KATIE:
Kristi!
You'd
better
run!

You
sound
crazy.
Do
you
know
that?
Hang
on
a
second,
all
right?
Do
you
know
how
crazy
Would
you
just
give
me
They
would
have
these
ceremonies
and
they
would
wait
till
the
girls
and
then
they
would...
They
would...
Oh!
Oh,
right.
And
then
they
would
brainwash
them
That
explains
it.
Mom?



Ow!
-
I
need
to
show
you
something.
There's
shit...
You
don't
even
spend
You
just
sit
here
-
Could
you
just
wait
one
second?
Just
wait
one
second.
No,
I
can't.
I
can't
wait.
-
No,
no,
no...
-
Why
not?
Because
Kristi's
upset
all
the
time...

Mommy?

What?
What?
What?
Toby

my
hair.

What
happened?
Toby
