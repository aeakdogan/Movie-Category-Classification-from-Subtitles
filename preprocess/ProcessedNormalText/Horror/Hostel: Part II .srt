Coffee?
Tell
us
about
this
place

It's
this...
.
It's
some
kind
of
factory...
...
where
these
people,
...
they
pay
to
torture
and
kill
kids.
Mostly
backpackers.
And
they
killed
two
of
my
friends.
They

how
you
survive.
I...
.
I

place?
I
don't
know.
They
all
have
the
same
tattoo.
It's
a
dog.
It's
a
bloodhound
dog.
Strange
that
you
mention
this
tattoo.
Why?
Because
someone
was
found
dead
...with
this
same
bloodhound
tattoo
Security

Somebody
help
me!
Jesus.
You

to
someone.
When

She
still
thinks
her
son's
in
Europe.
What

fuck
-
She'll
go
straight
to
the
police.
No,
no
one
should.
You
don't
get
it.
Somebody
starts
asking
questions...
...they're
gonna
come
after
me
At
my
grandmother's
house?
I've
I
can
barely
find
the
place.

You
told
your
sister
we
were
here?

I'm
doing
this
for
your
protection
too.
Oh,
Paxton...

Look.
I
took
you
back
because
I
felt
bad.

Paxton?
Hey.
Lorna?
Lorna?
Sorry.
I
was
trying
to
be
Absorb.
Do
you
think
she
ever
saw
a
cock
If
she
did,
it
was
in
a
Botticelli.
Oh,
my
God.
If
I
hear
her
talk
about
how
emotional
...I
swear
to
God,
Until
Tuesday.
Are
you
all
packed
for
Prague?
-
Jeans.
No
heels.
I
can't
do
it
on
the
cobblestone.
I

you
bring
heels.

shy.
That's
the
one
of
you.
-
Oh,
wow,
that's
beautiful.
How
much
would
you
want
for
it?
I
wouldn't
sell
them.

Oh,
my
God,
thank
you
so
much.
Can

Yeah.
She
cornered
me
in
the
apartment.
I
felt
bad.
What
am
I
supposed
to
say?
She's
homesick
for
Baltimore?
She's
not
that
bad.
Wow,
is
that
a
new
journal
Yeah.
It's
a
travel
journal.
For
emotional
callbacks.
Of

okay.
Thank
you.
All

Knock
yourself
out,
buddy.
See

Asshole.
She's
like
a
20-year-old
grandmother.
Whatever.
She'll
watch
our
stuff.
That's
what
she
likes
to
do.
Oh,

I'll
take
care
of
her.
I'm
sure
you
will,
but
not
tonight,
Good
night,
Miroslav!
I'm
sorry.
He
was
just
so
shady.
Whatever.
I
wanted
to
fuck
him,
but...
.
I
know
you
did.
I'll
make
it
up
to
you.
I
guess
Mr.
Rabbit's
gonna
have
to
Do
you
have
a
AA?
Mr.
Rabbit!
Come
here,
Rabbit!
Do
you
remember
the
first
guy
No,
but
I
remember
the
last.
Well,
I
do.
This
kid
Greg.
He
came
back
from
summer
break,
It
wasn't
anything
he
said
or
did,
but
I
know
what
you
mean.
It's
like
you
can
Exactly.
Like
an
animal.
Sometimes
you
meet
a
guy
and
there's
...something
that
makes
you
think,
He
doesn't
have
to
act
tough.
But
like
an
animal,
you
can
sense
it.
You
know
that
this
guy's
got
the
balls
And
that's
you
after
today,
my
friend.
People
are
gonna
fucking
fear
you.
What
we
do
today
is
gonna
pay
off
-
Where's
your
pager?
-
Come
on.
What
the
fuck?
Is
it
me?
Because
it
feels
like
You've
never
really
been
into
this.
I
don't
wanna
be
doing
something
-
It's
different
from
taking
on
an
image.
It's
time
we
fucking
do
it.
To
the
next
level.
To
the
next
level.
No,
wait.
Isn't
it
bad
luck
to
toast
with
water?
Yeah.
Bad
luck
Yeah.
Let
the
games
begin.
Hard,
hard,
hard.
Hey.
-
Hey,
did
she
call?
I
love
that
Lorna's
the
only
one
of
us
-
Hey,
I
tried.
Yeah,
she'd
say
Sure.
I
bet
she's
making
him
No,
I
bet
she's
in
a
cum
coma.
Thank
God.
At
least
she
has
something
Please!
Please!
Please!
Stop!
No!
Stop!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please,
no!
Relax.
Come

Guys!
Axelle!
Whit!
Stop.
Please
help
me!

Go
away.

Just
go
away
from
me!
Help
me.
I
tried
to
help,
but
you
don't
listen.
Dollar,
bitch!
Stop!
Get
in.
Yeah.
The
police
will
be
here
soon.
They
are
looking
for
your
friends.
Thank--

Thank
you.
So,
