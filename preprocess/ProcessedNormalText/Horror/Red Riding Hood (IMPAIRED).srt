RED
RIDING
HOOD

REEVE:
Full
moon.
Lock
up
tonight.
Better
the
wolf
takes
the
pig
than
you.
VALERIE:
Few
knew
our
village
by
name...
...but
many
had
heard
of
the
terrible
My
mother
always
told
me,
Go
get
water
and
come
straight
home."
I
tried
to
be
a
good
girl
PETER:
Valerie.
VALERIE:
Believe
me,
I
tried.
PETER:
Let's
go.
PETER:
Shh.

Do
you
have
the
knife?

Right
here.
VALERIE:
Look,
snow
white
fur.
PETER:

VALERIE:
Do
it,
Peter.
-PETER:
You
do
it.
MAN:
That's
it.
VALERIE:
I
know
good
girls
or
go
into
the
woods
alone.
But
since
we
were
kids,
he
always
had
a
CESAIRE:
Peter!
-Give
me
that.
-They
didn't
tell
you?
They've
arranged
for
you
to
marry
Well,
my
mother
finally
got
Money.
Henry
gets
what
he's
always
wanted.
So,
what
do
we
do
now?
Do
you
want
to
marry
him?
You
know
I
don't.
Prove
it.
-How?

Where
would
we
go?
Anywhere
you
want.
The
ocean.
The
city.
The
mountains.
You
afraid?
-No.

Really?
You'd
leave
your
home?
Your
family?
Your
whole
life?
I
would
do
anything
to
be
with
you.
I
thought
you'd
say
that.
-Oh,
did
you?
Let's
do
something
about
it.
It'd
be
half
a
day's
ride
before
I'll
race
you.


The
wolf.
MAN:
This
way!
Over
here!

It
killed
again.
But
we've
kept
the
peace.
Well,
the
wolf
has
broken
it.
Who
is
it?
Tell
me.
It's
your
sister.
Mother,
Father.



Lucie!
Lucie!
Thank
you,
Claude.

SUZETTE:
Madame
Lazar,
please
come
in.
-I'm
sorry
for
your
loss.
Let
me
take
that.
-ROSE:
Hello,
Henry.
ADRIAN:
Lucie
was
a
good
girl.
He's
your
fianc√©
now.
-But
I
barely
know
him.
Now
go
down
there.
Please.
Cesaire.
Come
with
us
to
the
tavern.
Let
the
women
grieve
in
their
own
way.
-I--
I--
I
want
to
go.
I
didn't
love
your
father
I
was
in
love
with
another
man.
But
I
came
to
love
your
father.
And
he
gave
me
two
beautiful
daughters.
AUGUSTE:
We
should
count
our
blessings.
REEVE:
Come
on,
Father.
It's
been
almost
20
years
since
REEVE:
Twenty
years.
That's
because
we
sacrifice
We
kept
our
end
of
the
bargain.
-So
now
we
kill
it.

MAN
1
:
Let's
kill
that
thing!
No.
I've
summoned
Father
Solomon.
-MAN
2:
Father
Solomon?
He
has
destroyed
werewolves
and
witches
He
will
rid
us
of
this
beast.
No.
He'll
rob
us
of
our
vengeance.
I
wonder
why
she
was
outside
Maybe
she
snuck
out
to
meet
a
boy.
My
Lucie
never
even
She
was
certainly
taken
She
used
to
come
by
and
follow
him
She
found
out
that
night
that
Henry
She
must
have
been
heartbroken.
Maybe
she
chose
to
die
How
romantic.
SUZETTE:
Prudence!
It's
unspeakable.
She
never
even
told
me.
Don't
worry,
dear.
Henry
always
had
his
eye
on
you.
You're
the
pretty
one.

PETER:
I'm
paying
my
respects.
I
know
exactly
why
you're
here.
I've
already
lost
one
daughter.
Valerie's
all
I
have
left.
You
have
nothing
to
offer
her.
I
have
a
trade.
The
same
one
I
know
what
a
woodcutter
earns.
Henry's
her
only
hope
for
a
better
life.
If
you
love
her...
...you'll
let
her
go.
We've
all
seen
the
bones
on
the
trail
That's
where
the
wolf
makes
its
lair.
BARKEEP:
We
know
the
weaknesses
It
can't
come
out
in
daylight.
-And
there's
silver.
MAN
2:
Silver!
Maybe
Father
Auguste
is
right.
Maybe
we
should
wait.

MAN
3:
Coward.

ADRIAN:
Maybe,
my
son...
...you
should
find
your
courage.
You
want
to
hunt
the
wolf?
Let's
hunt
it.
Let's
kill
it!
MAN
4:
Let's
kill
the
beast!
Let's
kill
it!

ROSE:
What's
going
on?
Come
on,
boys!
Are
you
with
me?!
Let's
go!
VALERIE:
Be
careful.
I
lost
my
sister.
I
can't
lose
you
too.
We
can't
do
this
anymore.
You
have
to
go
through
with
it.
But
you
know
I
don't
want
Henry.
Don't
make
this
something
it's
not.
Look,
we
had
our
fun.
I
don't
believe
you.
I
made
something
for
you.

I
was
gonna
wait
until
our
wedding,
Just
in
case.
You
will
be
happy
again.
I
promise.
BARKEEP:
Come
on,
Henry.
AUGUSTE:
We
should
wait.
-We
should
wait
for
Father
Solomon.
AUGUSTE:
He'll
be
here
tomorrow!
-MAN
2:
We're
gonna
kill
the
wolf.
That's
it?
Nobody
else?
Let's
go!
Go
home
to
your
mama's,
then.
Adrian.
Thank
you
for
standing
up
for
We'll
be
family
soon.
Promise
me
you'll
be
careful.
Don't
worry.
The
wolf
doesn't
want
me.
I'm
all
gristle.
I
mean
it,
son.
I
promise,
Mama.
VALERIE:
Grandmother.
GRANDMOTHER:
Oh.
Darling.
Darling.
Come.
Careful.
There
are
so
many
things
And
I'm
her
sister.
I
should've
known.
That
was
her
choice.
We
all
have
secrets.
Remember
what
my
grandma
used
to
say:
-"All
sorrows
are
less
with
bread."
Here.
Try
this.

How
beautiful.
I
was
making
it
for
your
wedding.

I
don't
feel
like
it's
my
wedding.
I
feel
like...
...I'm
being
sold.
REEVE:
Right
up
there.
You
better
watch
yourself.
There's
a
fork.
Let's
split
up.
Another
fork.
We'll
take
the
steep
one.
No.
We
should
stay
together.






Good
morning,
dear.
Morning,
Grandmother.
VALERIE:
Grandmother
told
us
that
the
...snatching
children
from
their
beds.
Those
stories
never
seemed
real
to
me.

Ripped
the
thing
out!

VALERIE:
Claude.


To
Adrian.
For
his
sacrifice.
CROWD:
To
Adrian.
WOMAN:
Poor
Henry.
VALERIE:
Henry.
Your
father
was
a
brave
man.
HENRY:
You
know,
And
I
was
afraid.
And
I
hid
from
it.
I
didn't
do
anything.
I
should've
saved
him.

-Henry--
I
don't
want
you
to
see
me
like
this.

It
was
Henry's
father,
wasn't
it?
Lucie
was
in
love
with
him.
She
was
a
year
older
than
me.
Why
did
you
insist
it
was
me?
I
think
you
know
the
answer
to
that.
I
want
you
to
say
it.
Lucie
was
Henry's
half-sister.
Adrian
was
her
father.
Does
Papa
know
about
Lucie?
No.
And
you
have
to
promise
me

AUGUSTE:
Father
Solomon.
He's
here.
ROXANNE:
Claude.
Presenting
His
Eminence....
Father
Solomon.
GIRLS:
Papa.
SOLOMON:
Oh,
please
don't
cry.
You
see?
You
see
all
these
children?
You
see
how
scared
they
are?
There's
a
big,
bad
wolf.
Is
that
the
beast
that
killed
our
mother?
SOLOMON:
It
may
very
well
be.
Go
on.
I'll
join
you
soon.
GIRL
1
:
No.
SOLOMON:
Go.
This
is
indeed
an
honor,
Your
Eminence.
Welcome.
You've
arrived
just
As
you
can
see,
That
is
not
a
werewolf.
No
disrespect...
...but
we
have
been
living
We
know
what
we're
dealing
with.
Well,
no
disrespect...
...but
you
have
no
idea

I
was
like
you
once.
My
wife's
name
was
Penelope.
She
gave
me
two
beautiful
daughters.
We
were
a
very
happy
family.
We
lived
in
a
village
like
this.
And
like
Daggerhorn...
...ours
was
plagued
by
a
werewolf.
One
full
moon,
We
decided
to
hunt
it.
It
never
occurred
to
us
that
we
might
It
ripped...
...my
best
friend
in
half.
Quickly.
And
then
it
was
on
me.
I
hacked
and
hacked
at
it
with
my
axe.
Suddenly...
...it
was
gone.
I
had
cut
off
one
of
its
front
paws.
I
thought
it
might
make
a
clever
And
there
I
found
my
wife...
...with
a
bloody
rag
And
when
I
opened
my
sack...
...the
werewolf's
paw...
...was
gone.

This
was
in
its
place.

SOLOMON:
I
told
my
girls
But
that
was
a
lie.
I
killed
her.
When
a
werewolf
dies,
That
is
just
a
common
gray
wolf.
Your
werewolf...
...is
still
very
much
alive.
This
is
one
of
only
three
silver
May
I
touch?
No.
This
is
a
very
dangerous
time.
You
all
know
They
have
no
idea
what
it
means.
The
orrery.
The
red
planet
converges
with
the
moon
This
is
the
only
time

During
the
week
of
the
Blood
Moon...
...the
werewolf
may
pass
his
curse
on
During
a
normal
full
moon,
But
during
a
Blood
Moon...
...your
very
souls
are
in
danger.
SOLOMON:
Until
the
Blood
Moon
wanes
...you
will
never
truly
be
safe.
We're
safe
now.
The
cave
at
Mount
Grimmoor.
SOLOMON:
You
have
been
deceived
It
made
you
think
...so
that
you
would
not
look
for
it
The
wolf
lives
here.
In
this
village.
Among
you.
The
real
killer
could
be
your
neighbor.
-What?
Even
your
wife.
-Barricade
the
village.
Post
men
at
every
gate!
-As
you
wish.
Tonight
we
celebrate!
CROWD:
Yes!
Go
ahead.
Celebrate.
We'll
see
who
is
right.


MAN
1
:
The
wolf
is
dead!

MAN
2:
Take
it
off!

MAN
3:
I'll
huff,
and
I'll
puff...
...and
I'll
blow
your
house
down!

MAN
4:
Laugh
at
the
little
man!

Valerie,
come
dance.


I'll
huff...
...I'll
puff...
...and
I'll
blow
your
house
down.


MAN
3:
Ow!

I'll
just
flick
this
off.
Papa.
You're
my
good
girl.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
know.
Just
go
home
now,
okay?

Tricked
you.
Ha-ha-ha.
Impressive.
Where
did
you
learn
that?
ROXANNE:
Claude.
Claude,
come
back
to
the
party.
Looks
like
Rose
has
a
new
conquest.
VALERIE:
Come
on,
Prudence.
You
left
us!
Take
it
easy,
friend.
I
said
we
should
stick
together
and
you
Please
don't
do
this.


Keep
your
hands
off
her
Peter.

PETER:
Leave
me
alone.
What's
the
matter
with
you?
I
love
you,
Peter.
What
are
you
doing
with
Rose?
I
don't
have
to
like
her
You're
a
terrible
liar.
I
know
you
feel
like
I
do.
I
know
you're
burning
inside.
I'll
never
be
able
to
give
you
Think
I
care
about
Henry's
money?
You
have
a
future
with
him.
Did
my
mother
get
to
you?
Valerie,
I'm
wrong
for
you.
I
don't
care.
I
could
eat
you
up.
Don't
you
want
me?
WOODCUTTER:
Hey,
Peter.
Come
on,
give
us
a
hand.
The
only
life
I
want
is
with
you.





So
where
did
you
disappear
to?
You
know
all
that
soft
hay



-MAN
1
:
Run!

-Peter!
Claude!

You
will
die
now,
beast!

The
wolf
can't
cross
onto
holy
ground!
SOLOMON:
The
church!

Claude!


Now!
Rope
it!


Hold
him!
Claude!


-SOLDIER:
It's
strong.


God
is
stronger!
I
warned
you!
I
warned
you!
Your
werewolf
is
still
alive!
Find
it!
Find
it!
Find
it.

Over
there!



WOLF:
You
can't
escape
from
me.
Oh,
my
God.
You
can
speak.
How?
WOLF:
You
understand
me.
You
know
my
name.
What
are
you
doing?

VALERIE:
Human
eyes,
dark
brown.
WOLF:
I
know
you
well.
You
dream
of
leaving
this
village.
Let
me
take
you
away.
You
and
I
are
the
same.
No,
I'm
nothing
like
you.
WOLF:
You're
a
killer
too,
aren't
you?
What
happened
to
the
rabbit,
Valerie?
VALERIE:
I
killed
it.
WOLF:
I
know.
So
come
with
me.
No.
WOLF:
Then
the
streets
will
run
red

SOLOMON:
Come
on!
Father
Solomon
will
stop
you.
WOLF:
I'm
coming
back
for
you

There!
Fire!
You
talked
to
the
wolf.
No,
it
talked
to
us.
No,
it
growled.
Wait,
you
heard
it
talk
to
you?
They'll
call
me
a
witch.
No,
of
course
not.
-Get
inside
onto
holy
ground.
-And
my
family.
-CAPTAIN:
Go.

We
were
wrong
to
have
doubted
you,
I've
never
seen
a
beast
as
strong
as
this.
A
creature
this
powerful
must
come
Each
generation
We
must
find
it
in
its
human
form.
CAPTAIN:
It
hasn't
survived
this
long
Look
for
the
signs.
Isolation.
Witchcraft.
The
black
arts.
Abnormal
behavior.
Strange
smells.
Your
homes
will
be
searched.
Your
secrets
brought
to
light.
If
you
are
innocent,
But
if
you
are
guilty...
...I
swear
by
Almighty
God...
...you
will
be
destroyed.

He's
still
alive!
Bring
me
water!
Hurry!
It's
a
Blood
Moon.
So
he
must--
He's
my
brother!

A
man
bitten...
...is
a
man
cursed!
PETER:
Valerie,
open
the
door.

We're
all
in
danger.
Come
away
with
me.
Come
away
with
me.
WOLF:
Come
away
with
me.
PETER:
I
can't
go
with
you,
Peter.
PETER:
Why
not?
VALERIE:
I'm
sorry.

What
happened?
She's
going
to
be
all
right.
The
wolf
just
scratched
her.
Lift
her
head,
Valerie.
Here.
Drink
this,
dear.
It'll
help
you
sleep.

You
sleep.

What
is
it,
darling?
What
is
it?
The
wolf.
It
talked
to
me.
And
you
understood
it?
As
clearly
as
I
understand
you.
Have
you
told
anyone
else
about
this?
Only
Roxanne
knows,
She
won't
even
talk
to
me
about
it.
It
chose
not
to
kill
you.
I
think
it
wants
me
alive.


-SUZETTE:
No.
SUZETTE:
No.
I
have
to
get
clean
water.
VALERIE:
Has
Claude
come
home?
Nobody's
seen
him.
SOLDIER
1
:
SOLDIER
2:
You
have
to
let
us
in.
I
saw
you
with
Peter.
I
know
you
don't
want
me
like
that.
I'm
not
gonna
force
you
to
marry
me.
I'm
gonna
break
off
the
engagement.
I'm
sorry,
Henry.
WOMAN:
That's
enough!
SOLDIER
1
:
Father
Solomon!
SOLDIER
2:
In
the
tower!
SOLOMON:
Quickly!
-ROXANNE:
It's
my
brother!
Don't
touch
him!
-Interrogate
him!
Look
at
him!
His
speech
is
twisted.
Get
him
down!
Now!
He
hasn't
done
anything!
This
is
proof
He's
a
conjurer.
-I
know
him.
You
never
know
Get
him
down!
Come
on!


Give
me
the
name
of
the
wolf.
Give
me
the
name.
Tell
me
the
name!

The
Romans
invented
this.
An
ingenious
system
How
can
he
give
you
a
name?
Listen
to
how
he
sings

We
do
this
for
the
greater
good.
What's
the
good
in
this?
I
killed
my
wife
to
protect
my
children.
Our
methods
of
pleasing
God
You
had
best
develop
a
stomach
for
it.


She
says
it's
important.
I've
come
to
bargain
Silver
fingernails.
SOLOMON:
To
kill
a
werewolf.

Get
out.
Please,
I
have
more
than
money
to
offer.
Turn
around.


Enough.
Move.
Wait,
please.
I
have
something
else.
Spare
my
brother
Now,
that...
...is
worth
something.
SOLOMON:
Tell
them
what
you
told
me.
She
can
climb
the
tallest
trees.
She
wears
a
red
cloak.
That's
nonsense.
I
made
that
cloak.
Silence!
Continue.
And
she
can
talk
to
werewolves.

I've
seen
it.
With
my
own
eyes.
-Do
you
deny
it?
And
what
was
the
nature
It
promised
to
leave
Daggerhorn
The
wolf
is
someone
in
this
village
Do
you
know
who
it
is?
I'd
think
very
hard
if
I
were
you.
Tell
me.
Tell
me
who
it
is.
Give
me
a
name.
It
wants
her,
not
you.
If
you
wish
to
save
yourselves,
You
can't
give
her
to
the
wolf.
We've
all
made
sacrifices.
The
trial
is
over.
I
said
go
home.
All
of
you!
-I
thought
you
cared
about
her.
I
do
care.
I'm
trying
to
be
smart
about
it.
CAPTAIN:
Go
to
the
granary.
You're
gonna
try
and
rescue
her?
-Well,
I'll
help.
Oh,
really?
Then
what's
your
plan,
huh?
See,
you
don't
have
one.
Look,
you've
seen
those
locks.
I've
got
a
shop
and
I've
got
tools.
Okay.
Fine.
But
if
you're
the
wolf,
I
will
do
the
same
to
you.
Fair
enough.
CAPTAIN:
Go
home!
Where's
my
brother?
Father
Solomon
We
did.


VALERIE:
Grandma.
Bread.
Blanket.
Do
you
need
anything
else?
I
do
not
want
you
to
use
that
knife.
-We
have
to
find
the
wolf.
Listen,
the
wolf
wants
you.
No.
I
didn't
know
it,
And
when
she
found
out
...she
gave
herself
to
the
wolf.
No.
Lucie
wouldn't
do
that.
-SOLDIER:
Your
time
is
up.
Please
see
that
she
gets
that.

Oaf.
Cesaire.
I'm
gonna
save
your
daughter.
I'd
like
your
blessing
in
this,
What
can
I
do?

We're
closed.
It's
me.
Hello,
Henry.
-I
brought
you
some
biscuits.
I
just
wanna
thank
you
Here,
try
some.
Yes.
That
was
very
brave
of
you.
I
said
what
I
felt.
You
know...
...I
want
you
to
know
you're
under
no
You're
no
longer
engaged
to
her.
She's
in
love
with
someone
else.
That
doesn't
mean
I
imagine
that's
just
how

She
had
a
crush
on
me.
Oh,
more
than
a
crush.
I
think
she
would
Even
agree
to
meet
you
on
a
wolf
night
Why
are
you
doing
this?
Do
you
think
I'm
the
wolf?
I'm
not
accusing
you
of
anything.
I
just
want
to
find
out
the
truth.
It's
you.
My
God,
it's
you.
Heh.
What
can
you
smell
on
me?
The
night
my
father
died,
I
could
smell
And
I
can
smell
it
all
over
you
right
now.
What
do
you
do
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
On
the
night
that
Lucie
died?
You
don't
know,
do
you?
I
know
what
you're
doing.
And
I'm
not
Oh.
You're
coming
with
us.

-I
haven't
done
anything.
Father
Solomon
doesn't
want

It's
time
to
put
on
your
harlot's
robe.
CESAIRE:
Valerie.
I
did
my
best
to
protect
you.
You
and
Lucie.
I
know,
Papa.
You
taught
us
to
be
strong.
VALERIE:
Father
Solomon
had
designed
And
even
my
friends
stared,
judging
me.
SUZETTE:
Stop.
VALERIE:
What
if
they
were
right?
Maybe
the
wolf
knew
something
I
didn't.
Maybe
there
was
something
You
should
all
go
home!

I'm
so
sorry,
Valerie.
I
didn't
mean
for
this
to
happen.
Bless
you,
my
dear.

VALERIE:
Prudence.
Valerie?
Roxanne
wanted
me
-She
said
those
things
to
save
her
brother.
Of
course.
But
I
wanted
to
say....
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
VALERIE:
But
I
want
to.
I
want
you
to
know
that...
...you
may
have
fooled
Roxanne...
...but
you
don't
fool
me.
Not
anymore.
You
were
always
too
good.
Too
pretty.
Too
perfect.
You
tricked
us.
Now
you're
gonna
get
what
you
deserve.
VALERIE:
Prudence,
I
think
you
should
go.
PRUDENCE:
Yes.
It
won't
be
long
now.
The
wolf
is
coming.
SOLOMON:
The
wolf
lives
here.
Your
neighbor.
Your
best
friend.
You're
the
pretty
one.
-I
could
eat
you
up.
VALERIE:
Human
eyes,
dark
brown.
WOLF:
I
know
you
well.
Do
you
know
how
you
kill
a
tiger,
You
tie
out
your
best
goat...
...and
wait.
SOLDIER
1
:
Fire!

-Put
it
out!
Go!
I'm
gonna
get
you
out
of
here.

SOLDIER
2:
It's
too
much!


HENRY:
Don't
move.
There!
He's
taken
the
bait!
Fire!
Wait,
that's
not
the
wolf!
He's
aiding
a
witch!
-Fire!
Run!


Run.

This
one
started
the
fire.
Lock
him
up.
In
the
elephant!
-Go!
SOLOMON:
The
witch
has
escaped!
Get
over
here!
Find
the
witch!
Come
on,
Peter's
meeting
us

Valerie!
Valerie!
VALERIE:
Where's
Peter?
I
don't
know.
He
said
he'd
be
here.
If
he
doesn't
show...
...I'm
gonna
take
you
away.
WOLF:
Let
me
take
you
away.
Do
you
think
I'm
the
wolf?
SOLOMON:
Find
the
witch!

SOLDIER
3:
Come
on!
Quickly!
HENRY:
Go.
SOLDIER
3:
That
way!
We
should
go
to
the
church.
The
wolf
can't
cross
onto
holy
ground.
CAPTAIN:
SOLDIER
4:
SOLDIER
5:
They're
in
here!
After
them!
WOLF:
valerie.



Henry.
Henry.
Go.
Valerie,
go!
No.
I'm
not
leaving
you.
-VALERIE:
We
claim
sanctuary.
-This...

...belongs
to
me.




You
want
her
alive?!
Kill
it!


WOLF:
Valerie.
Step
across
the
gate,
Come
with
me
before
the
sun
rises.
Make
your
decision.
I
won't
let
you
destroy
my
home.
-I'll
go
with
you.
If
you
promise
to
leave
them
alone.
No.
I
won't
let
you

-Nor
will
l.
I
stand
by
Valerie.

WOLF:
You
can't
hide
from
me.
-Aah!


Under
the
Blood
Moon...
...a
man
bitten
is
a
man
cursed.
My
children
will
be
orphaned.
My
brother...
...had
children
too.
I
meant
only
to
serve.
To
protect
us
from
darkness.

Under
the
Blood
Moon...
...a
man
bitten
is
a
man
cursed.
Where's
Peter?
Where's
Peter?

Grandmother.
What
big
eyes
you
have.
The
better
to
see
you
with,
my
dear.
Grandmother,
what
big
ears
you
have.
The
better
to
hear
you
with,
my
dear.
What
big
teeth
you
have.


Valerie.
What
are
you
doing
out
of
bed?
I
was
so
worried.
It
looks
much
better.
Where
are
you
going?
To
Grandmother's.
We're
going
after
the
wolf
It'll
be
human
again
And
I
have....
What?
Tell
me.
Peter
is
still
missing.
I'll
do
what
I
have
to
do.
Please
be
careful.
PETER:
Valerie.
Thank
God
you're
all
right.
Where
were
you?
PETER:
I
was
trapped
I
finally
broke
out.
Don't
come
near
me.
Valerie,
what?
You
don't
believe
me?
I'll
hurt
you.
No,
you
won't.
Please
don't.

Grandmother!

Grandmother,
are
you
all
right?
I
had
a
nightmare.
-Ah!

I
just
woke
up.
There's
some
soup
if
you're
hungry.

I
think
the
wolf
is
out
there.
It's
all
right,
darling.
Eat
up.
Remember:
-"All
sorrows
are
less
with
bread."
That's
right.
Eat
up,
my
dear.
What
is
this?
Father,
what
are
you
doing
here?
Where's
Grandmother?
I
had
no
choice.
She
finally
realized
what
I
am.
How
could
you
do
this?
Sit
down.

Sit
down.

Oh,
Valerie.
I've
been
so
disrespected.
I've
settled
for
far
less
than
I
deserve.
So
I
decided
I'd
leave.
For
the
city.

For
richer
hunting
grounds.
Why
didn't
you
just
leave?
Because
I
loved
you
girls.
I
wanted
you
to
come
with
me.
-But
you
had
to
wait
for
the
Blood
Moon.
By
birthright...
...the
gift
would
go
first
So
I
forged
a
letter.
But
when
I
tried
to
speak
to
her--
WOLF:
Henry's
not
coming,
Lucie.


--she
didn't
understand
me.
Any
offspring
of
mine
with
my
wolf
And
then
it
all
made
sense.
Lucie
couldn't
be
my
daughter.
But
you
knew
that
already,
didn't
you?
After
all
these
years
of
being
so
clever

I'm
sorry
for
Lucie.
You
took
revenge
on
Mother.

And
her
lover.


CESAIRE:
And
then
again
yesterday.
He
thought
the
smell
But
she
had
lived
You
see,
my
father
was
a
wolf
too.
The
smell
remained
on
his
clothing.
Mother
never
knew
what
it
meant...

CESAIRE:
...till
the
moment
she
died.
I
loved
her.
Her
and
Lucie
both.
Valerie,
come
with
me.
It's
the
last
day
of
the
Blood
Moon.
One
bite,
and
you'll
be
like
me.
I
won't
do
what
you
do.
I
can't.
Yes,
you
can,
Valerie.
My
blood
already
It's
a
gift.
It's
a
gift
my
father
gave
to
me
I'm
stronger
than
he
was,
Think
about
it.
We
will
be
invincible.
There
must
be
a
God,
And
you're
the
devil's
daughter.
You're
not
so
terrifying

How
would
you
know?

VALERIE:
Papa!
I
have
something
for
you.


VALERIE:
Peter.
Get
me
out
of
here.
Ow.
He
bit
me.
When
the
moon
rises...
...I'll
be
like
him.
A
beast.
VALERIE:
I
saw
it
all
differently.
All
the
lies.
My
mother's,
my
father's.
He
was
all
I
had
left.
VALERIE:
Peter.
VALERIE:
Even
when
I
doubted
him...
...even
when
I
wounded
him...
...Peter
was
true.
I'm
so
sorry.
PETER:
No
one
can
know
about
your
father.
They'll
hang
you...
...for
being
the
daughter
of
the
wolf.
Peter.
PETER:
I
have
to
leave.
You
won't
be
safe
with
me...
...until
I
learn
how
to
protect
you
from....
I'll
wait
for
you.
I
thought
you'd
say
that.
VALERIE:
It
was
the
most
brutal
winter
With
time,
my
mother
finally
realized
Henry
found
his
courage.
He
chose
a
life
of
honor,
Daggerhorn
fell
back
The
wolf
didn't
come
back.
But
the
village
still
lived
in
fear.
It
was
the
only
life
they
knew.
I
could
no
longer
live
there.
I
felt
more
freedom
To
live
apart
carries
its
own
dangers.
But
of
those...
...I
am
less
afraid.
