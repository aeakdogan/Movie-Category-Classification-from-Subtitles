This

MRS.
FRANKENSTEIN:

Oh!
MRS.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Watch
out!

Sparky!


MR.
FRANKENSTEIN:


MR.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Whoo!
MRS.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Oh,
my!
MR.
FRANKENSTEIN:
-
Bravo!
MRS.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Oh!

MR.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Um...
Maybe
just
unplug
it.

Well,
it
certainly
was
exciting.
MR.
FRANKENSTEIN:
I
can
fix
this.
Come
on,
boy.
All
that
time
he
spends
up
there.
A
boy
his
age
I
don't
know
that
Victor
has
friends,

That's
my
point.
I
don't
want
him
to
turn
out,
There's
nothing
wrong
with
Victor.





Easy,
boy.
See
you
later,
sweetie.
Have
a
good
day.
Victor!
Come
on,
honey.
Go
put
Sparky
in
the
back
yard.
Come
on,
Sparky!




Good
morning,
Mr.
Burgemeister.
Your
dog
has
been
The
other
day
I'll
keep
an
eye
on
him.
You
better.
Yes,
sir.
Go
on,
Sparky.
That's
right!
Good
boy.
See
you
later!


Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
School.
What
about
that
dog
of
yours?
She's
not
in
the
house
I
want
you
to
remember
something.
While
your
parents
are
away,
Yes,
Uncle
Bob.
Dutch
Day
is
coming
up,
-
How's
your
song
coming?
Keep
at
it!
Dutch
Day
is
a
big
day
for
me.
Yes,
sir.
Good
morning,
children.
I
am
Mr.
Rzykruski.
I
will
be
your
new
science
teacher.
Apparently,
Mr.
Holcomb
He
got
hit
by
lightning!
Well,
that
is
bad.
But
he
did
not
get
"hit"
by
lightning.
Lightning
does
not
hit
a
person
the
way
Lightning
is
simply
electricity.
The
cloud
is
angry.
Yes.
Making
storm.
All
the
electrons
are
saying,
"I
go
to
the
land
of
opportunity!"
The
ground
says,
"Yes,
we
need
electrons
"Come.
Come!
Welcome."
So
both
sides
start
to
build
a
ladder.
This
man,
he
comes
out
He
does
not
see
the
invisible
ladders.
When
the
two
ladders
meet...
Boom!

The
circuit
is
complete
and
all
of
the
electrons
rush
This
man
is
in
the
way!
Ahh!
But
it
is
very
rare
But
it's
not
rare.
Lightning
happens
There's
a
thunderstorm
My
dad
got
hit
twice.
They
built
New
Holland
I
heard
it
was
a
cemetery.
That's
where
they
buried
the
miners.
It's
the
windmill
that
does
it.
Turning,
turning
the
air
until
No.
Cemetery.
Definitely.









Students,

Mr.
Whiskers

know?
Because
this
morning
he
made
this.
Oh.
Did
you
get
that

of
the
litter
box?
It's
an
omen.
Last
month
he
dreamed
about
Bob.
He
fell

a
manhole.

He
dreamed
about
Toshiaki
the
day
he
pitched
a
perfect
game.

And

Mr.
Whiskers
dreams
about

it

You

One

you'll

about

Hey,

How
are
you
doing?

You'll

right,
Victor?
Because

it
says
no
death
rays.
See?
Oh,
man.
I
still
want
to
do
it.
Come
on.
Who
else
would
be
your
partner?
You
don't
have
friends
and
neither
do
I.
I'm
sorry,
Edgar.
I
like
to
work
alone.

Victor,

I

I
tell
people,
"You

"You

Will
you
sign

Okay.
In
my
job,
sometimes
you
have
people
who
don't

Say
a

it's

gets

But
there's
no
river.
And
no
jungle.

Nobody
gets
what
they
want.
And
wrong.
They
both
get
what
they
want
You'd
like
to
do
the
science

I'd
like
you
to
try
a

Science
fair,
baseball.
How
do
you
choose?
No
reason
you
can't
do
both.
You
meet
in
the

Look
at
what
Toshiaki's
doing.
He's
keeping
his

on

I
want
you
to

Come

Whoa.
Nice

Come

Tie
Sparky
up
and

Sorry,
boy.
Hey,

Nice

It
is
okay
to

Eh?

MRS.
FRANKENSTEIN:

Yes!
Come
on,
honey!



Victor,
run!
Sparky!





Sparky!
No!


He
was
a
great
dog.
A
great
friend.
The
best
dog
a
kid
could
have.
When
you
lose
someone
you
love,
They

into
He'll
always
be
there,
Victor.
I
don't
want
him
in
my
heart.
I
know.
If
we
could
bring
him
back,
we
would.
Try
and
get
some
sleep,
sweetheart.

Hi,
Victor!
How
was
school?
VICTOR:
Okay.







-
Shoo!









I'm
sorry,
boy.



You're
alive!

You're
alive!

You're
alive!
I
can't

it!
You're

I
can

that.

It
worked.

It
really
worked.

MRS.

Victor,
breakfast!
Victor?
Are
you
up
here?

VICTOR:

Quiet
down,
boy.
MRS.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Victor?


Sparky,
Shh!
Quiet.
Victor!

French
toast

waffles?
Uh,
waffles.
Then
I'll
need
my
waffle
iron
back,
It's
my
science
project.
It's
a
robot.
-
A
robotic
bucket?
-
For
mopping,
I
suppose?
Maybe
when
you're
finished,

Sorry,
boy,
but
I
can't
let

may
not

So,
you

How
was

Sparky?
Sparky?

There
you

Good

Sorry

What's
the
matter,

Are
you
okay?

Hmm.
You're

Let's

you
up.

Hey.
Edgar,

No.
I

Look,
I

think
Your

is

That's
impossible.
I
know
it
is
so
impossible,
but
you
did
it.
You
did
it!
So,
show
me
how,
or
I'll
tell
everyone.
-
Oh,
Mrs.
Frankenstein!
May
I
have

cookie,
please?
Oh.
Yes,
of
course.

All
right,
come
on.
Oh!
I
think
the
wind

the
lightning
some
kind
of
strange
force.
But
the
wind
isn't
strong
enough
For
that,
you
need
lightning.
So
when
can
I
do
it?
You
can't.
This
isn't
an
experiment.
Show-and-tell,
Victor.
You
show
me,
and
I
won't
tell.
CLERK:
Can
I
help
you,
young
man?
I'd
like

Certainly.
Which
one?
This
one.


What
do
we
do
now?


What
happened
to
it?
What
did
you
do?
I
don't
know.
It
should
have
worked.

It's
invisible.
It's
an
invisible
goldfish.
-
Why
is
it
invisible?

You
can't
tell
anyone.
Not
until
we
figure
out
how
it
works.
Okay,
Okay.
-
Promise?
How
are
we
supposed
Put
your
finger
in.
You
can
feel
it.
Ah!
It
bit
me!
Let
me
see
it.

It's
my
science
project,
Mmm.
Yeah?
Well,
-
What
is
it?
Sea-Monkeys?
BOB:
We
got
to
come
up

Hmm.

Okay,
okay.
Sit

Shh.
Sparky,

Shh.
No!
Shh!
Sorry,

Shh!



Toshiaki

No,
he
didn't.
I
didn't

that.
Who

Toshiaki

If
it
was,
I
couldn't
tell
you.
So
it
isn't,
or
it
is?
No.
Yes.

I'm
confused.
Do
you
have
an
invisible
fish?
Okay.
But
you
have
to
keep
it
a
secret.
Swish
your
finger
around.
It's
just
water.
There's
nothing
there.
No,
it's
invisible.
Huh?
I
don't
know
what
kind
but
that
trophy
will
be
mine.

Victor.

Something's
wrong
with
my
fish!
-
What
is
it?
Maybe
it
just
hopped
out.
Yes,
ever
since
I
left
your
house.
I
mean,
it
was
there
when
I
went
to
bed.
I'm
thinking
maybe
they
don't
last.
They're
only
there
for
a
little
bit


No!
Sparky!

-
Sparky!

Don't
worry.
I
can
fix
that,
too.
Good
night,

Mmm.

Are
you
sure
this
is
going
to

No.
That's

Do
we
have

I
think
the
confusion

Is
that
right
word,
"ignorant"?
I
mean
"stupid,"
"primitive,"

You
do
not
understand

is
magic
and
witchcraft

bark.
You
are
barking?


Hmm.
You

miss

Uh,

to
go.
Bye.
Bye.

I
feel
so
sad
for

He
really
misses
his

All
I

I'll

Do
you

I
know
more

you
do.
Mr.

knew

Well,

get
cracking,

Even

Your
country
does
not
Always
needs
more.
You
should
be
a
scientist,
Victor.
Nobody
likes
scientists.
They
like
what
science
gives
them,
Not
the
questions
that
science
asks.
Actually,
I
have
a
question.

That
is
why
you
are
a
scientist.
I
was
doing
my
experiment,
my
project,
but
the
next
time
it
didn't.
I
mean,
it
sort
of
worked,
And
I
don't
know
why.
Then
maybe
you
never
really
People
think
science
is
here,
The
first
time,
did
you
Yes.
MR.
RZYKRUSKI:
Ah.
And
the
second
time?
No.
I
just
wanted
it
over.
Then
you
changed
the
variables.
I
was
doing
it
for
the
wrong
reason.
Science
is
not
good
or
bad,
Victor.
But
it
can
be
used
both
ways.
That
is
why
you
must
always
be
careful.

I
can't
believe
I
broke
None
of
us
are
going
to
win!
No,
he
doesn't.
You're
saying
he
faked
it?


That
fish
you
showed
us,
was
it
real?
It
was,
and
it
was
dead,
too.
You
brought
an
animal
No,
Victor
did.
With
lightning,
and
boom,
and
sss.
Impossible.
I
swear!
I
mean,

He
brought
back
Sparky?
Mmm.
Victor
will
win
the
science
fair
Bigger.
You
say
you
know
Victor's
secret?
Now
is
your
chance
to
prove
it.
Now,
where's
my
muffin
tin?
Victor.
Sparky?



Sparky!
But
you're...
Sparky's
alive!
Sparky?

Hey,
come
on!

Mom?
Dad?
What's
going
on?
Sparky!
No!
Sparky!
Sparky.
no!
Sparky,
come

Sparky!
Hey,
hey!
Just
a
minute!
No!
I
have
to
go
find
Sparky!
Victor,
what
have
you
done?
You
said
yourself,
if
you
could
Yes,
but
that
was
different
It's
easy
to
promise
the
impossible.
What
you
did
was
a
very
serious
thing.
Crossing
the
boundary
Reanimating
a
corpse!
It's
very...
Upsetting.
I
just
wanted
my
dog
back.
Oh,
sweetheart.
We'll
help
you
look
for
Sparky
but
when
we
get
back,
Understood?
Yes.
Now,
let's
go
find
your
dog.





Sparky!
Sparky,
are
you
in
there?
Mom,
Dad!
I'm
going
You

Got
it.

Cool.
Interesting.

don't

understand
it.
Oh,

do!

shall
bring
the
dead
to

Sparky!
Where
are
you?
Sparky!




Sparky!
Sparky!

so
much.

it's
