Maybe
she
was
abducted
by
aliens.

This
is--
Oh,
my
God,
Claire!
-

-
We
know
each
other.

Norman.

Oh!
There
was
this
brilliant
in
purple
bikini
briefs,
Shhh.
That's--
Cursing
his
ass
off
in
Finnish.
Oh,
Claire.
-
Oh,
God.
-
So
how
long
have
you
-
Ah,
what
a
job.
-
Do
you
remember
Beau
Flynn,
-
How's
Caitlin?
-
I
just
dropped
her
off
at
college.
-
Some
stalking
incident
-
Oh,
we're
getting
so
old.
-
They
don't
screw
around
-
When
was
the
last
time
-
Oh,
of
course,
'cause
-
Yeah.
-
Marlov.
-
Oh,
the
musician.
You
know,
we
all
Have
you
heard
her
play?
-
No.

-

and,
truly,
I
had
tears
I
mean,
she's
fabulous.
So,
why'd
you
stop?
Oh...
well,
one
night,
I
met
a
dashing,
handsome,
and
three
months
later
Ohh.
Now,
is
that--
is
that
when
you
guys
-
No,
we
were
living
in
Boston...
when
Norman
was,
um,
-
A
position?
DuPont
Chair
in
genetics.
Oh,
I
see,
of
course.
Uh,
well,
I
actually
I
run
a
research
project.
Oh.
Um,
Norman's
father
uh,
stately
place
on
a
lake.
-
Which
we're
renovating.
-
No,
we
didn't.
{y:i}
-
It
is
beautiful.
You'll
see
it.
It's
haunted.
{y:i}
Claire's
hearing
things.
-
What?
What
are
you
hearing?

I,
um--
I
don't
know.
I
heard,
uh,
voices,
whispering.
A
picture
fell.
You
know,
I
completely
-
You
do?
Wait
a
minute.
I
know
exactly
who
it
is.
It's
my
old
man.
He's
pissed
about
us


Ow!
Tsk.
Hmm.

What
is
it?
Jesus.
-
What's
the
matter?
Calm
down,
Claire.
It's
okay.
{y:i}
Whose
idea
was
it?
Mine.
His.
We
both
thought--
I
didn't
want
to
come
here.
-
Then
why
did
you?
-
Your
husband?
you'll
pack
me
full
-

-
Do
you
really
think
so?
-
And
are
you
on
medication?
-
For
sleeping.
Sometimes,
um,
Do
you
get
anxious
only
at
night?
No,
I
only
take
For
sleeping?
Why
do
you
get
anxious?
I
don't
know.
Why
do
you
think
your
husband
Because--
I
don't
know.
Because
ever
since
Well,
ever
since
There
have
been--
I-I've
been--
Here,
have
a
fireball.

Thank
you.
It's
hard...
because
and
we're
talking
about
things
Besides,
most
people
when
they
{y:i}part
of
them
is
wondering
-

{y:i}I
am
required
to
have
at
least
{y:i}-
That
was
a
joke.
These
are
good.
There's
a
ghost
in
my
house.
I
saw
her
in
the
water,
What
does
she
look
like?
She
looked
like...
me.
Oh,
only
she
had
green
eyes.
{y:i}Any
idea
who
she
is?
Maybe,
but
I'd
rather
Fine.
So
what
do
you
think
Try
to
contact
her,
{y:i}Find
out
what
she
wants.

Ahhh.
Are
we
hoping
the
ghost
This
where
she
was.
Oh,
that
makes
sense.
Kmart.
You
know,
I
think
we're

What's
that
for?
You
stole
You
have
to
have
something
Says
who?
I
don't
know.
Okay.

We
wish
to
commune

{y:i}-
What?
-
Oh,
forget
it.
-
No,
this
whole
thing
is
insane.
What-What's
her
first
name?
Mary...
Feur.
Mary
Feur.
Mary
Feur.
{y:i}Mary
Feur.

{y:i}with
the
spirit
of
Mary
Feur.
-
Not
much
happening.

What
was
that?
It
was
flickering.
{y:i}Yeah.

{y:i}Wha--
Did
you
see
that?
Yeah.
{y:i}

Cooper!
{y:i}Listen,
Norman
doesn't
need
to
know.
I
won't
tell
if
you
won't
tell.
It's-It's
just
that
he,
he
treats
me
like
Well,
I
am
seeing
ghosts
You
did
wrap
your
car
He
was
pretty
shaken
up.
It
was
an
accident.
Right?

You're
just
not
much
I'll
call
you
tomorrow.
Did
you
pick
up
I
have
one
in
the
trunk.

{y:i}
{y:i}-

Wha--
What
do
you
want?

-
She's
dead.
-
You
know
damn
well
who's
dead.
Listen
to
me.
He
killed
her,
-
Jody
and
I
had
a
seance
Jody
and
I!
Nothing
happened.
-

{y:i}You-You
had
a
seance?
Are
you
angry
with
me?
What?
-
Maybe
you
resent
You
know
what
I've
got
-
You
know
how
important
I
can't
help
but
feel
-
You're
trying
Something
is
happening
to
me,
and
it's
not
some
warped
Something
is
happening
in
our
house,

Claire.
Claire,
stop.
Don't
tell
me
how
to
react.
-
Will
you
keep
your
voice
down?
Maybe
you're
right.
But
what
if
I'm
not?
-
Can
we--
Can
we
please
not
do
this
here?
-
Oh,
wow.
You.
You
think
Well,
I
know
you
killed
her,
{y:i}-
Who?
-

-
Forgive
us,
please.
I
didn't
kill
my
wife.

-

-
Hmm?
Oh,
yeah.
I'm-I'm
fine.
What
happened,
just
now?
Oh,
I-I
just
saw
Norman's
face.
{y:i}Oh,
he
was
How's
your
marriage?
Good.
Really
good.
We've
had
our
moments,
I
guess,
but
he's
a
wonderful
I
mean,
sure,
he
can
be
and
sometimes
it's
like,
um,
that
he
doesn't
see
me.
Or,
you
know,
like
I'm--
that
there's
something
That
can't
feel
good.

Okay,
okay,
I-I-I
see
where
But
my
marriage
is
fine.
Now,
I
have
had
some
kind
where
I-I
saw...
some
things
Let's
deal
with
that.

"Thought
you
might
need
this.

Mrs.
Spencer--

for
scaring
you
like
I
did.
When
I
thought
about
what
Please,

Claire

Would
you
like
a
cup
of
coffee?
Very
much.
{y:i}That
day
at
the
fence,
I-I
don't
think
I
imagined
that.
No.
What
were
you
so
afraid
of?
Have
you
ever
felt
so
completely
that
you
couldn't
breathe?
Thought
that
your
time
together
that
you
felt
physical
pain
Um,
sure.
I
couldn't
catch
my
breath,
I
never
dreamed
I
tried
to
leave
him.
I
went
to
my
mother's
But
he
brought
my
things
up
and
pleaded
with
me
-

No.
No.
I,
I
don't.

make
this
quick.

telling
me

Almost.
It's
good
to
see
you
doing
so
well.
-
Thank
you.
I
don't
think
I've
seen
you
since
You
were
worried?
I
swear,
I've
become...
that
nosey
old
lady

used
to
run
No,

so
upset.

Claire,
I'm
afraid
to
ask.

It's
her.
{y:i}-
The
woman
I
saw
in
the
bathtub.
{y:i}Yes,
the
ghost.
I
thought

liked
to
read
a
lot,
though.
Sometimes
she'd
lock
herself
up
They
wanted
to
put
her
in

I
don't
know
where
she
got
it.
{y:i}She
probably
got
it
from

never

Yeah,
well,
she
wouldn't.

was

left.

You
can
pretty
much
tell
I
turn
it
up

want
to

Claire?

Hello,
Dr.
Spencer.
Mrs.
Spencer.
Forbidden
fruit.
You
got
a
problem
with
that?
I
guess
this
means
you're
I
wouldn't
go
that
far.
Oh.



Take
it
easy,
huh?
What's
got
into
you?
Mmm.
Ow!
-
What's
the
matter?
Since
when?

-
Jesus
Christ,
-
Claire,
listen
to
me.
Why
don't
you
just...
shut
up...
and...

I
think
she's
starting
{y:i}Who?
-
Your
wife.
Stop
it!
{y:i}
-
You
know.
I
know.
I
was
there.
Just
before
the
accident.
What?
I
came
to
the
door.
There
was
whispering.
I
saw
you
in
the
mirror...
lying
there...
with
her...
-
Claire,
listen
to
me.
She
was
at
the
DuPont
party,
-
It
was
her.
That's
why
I
couldn't
breathe.
-
That's
why
I
dropped
the
glass.
-
We
were
having
troubles.
-
That's
not
what
I'm
saying.
Get
away
from
me.

I
said
get
out!
Fine.
Claire,
please,
please--
I
gave
up
everything.
Claire,
please
don't--
-

My
life,
my
music!
Oh,
there
was
never
You
had
to--
to
be
perfect
daddy.
That's
not
fair.
You
were
happy
to
give
it
up.
-
Who?
-
You
leave
her
out
of
this.
-
some
bright
young
woman
-
And
I
slipped.
-
Claire,
I
tried
to
break
it
off.
I
was
in
Adamant.
In
Adamant?
{y:i}That
artsy
little
hippie
village
I
stopped
at
this
little
cafe,
and
but
he
wasn't
alone.
{y:i}It
was
a
young
blonde
woman.
And
I
didn't
think
I
was
walking
over
to
say
hello.
And
they
started
arguing
that
it
stopped
me.
{y:i}And
then
a
few
days
later,
{y:i}and
I
get
a
bizarre
call
from
{y:i}asking
me
was
I
with
you
{y:i}He
made
it
sound
like
{y:i}and
I
thought,
"Oh,
my
God,
{y:i}And
when
I
went
to
the
hospital,
{y:i}I
see
Norman...
and
he
was
so
desperate
of
losing
you.
{y:i}I
couldn't
say
anything.
{y:i}Please...
don't
hate
me,
Claire.
I
don't
hate
you.
{y:i}

Leave
your
name
and
number,
Jody,
it's
Norman.
Will
you
please--
{y:i}
I
can't
talk
to
him.
Will
you
call
him
and
tell
him
I
have
to
ask
him
something.
{y:i}
{y:i}
Norman?
{y:i}
Norman?
{y:i}Norman!
No--
Oh,
God.
Norman!
{y:i}-

How's
his
blood
pressure?
{y:i}-
And
how
about
his
rhythm?
-
No
sign
of
arrhythmia.
Pulse
ox
is
normal.
-
I'd
still
like
-
Dr.
Powell,
I'd
recommend
-
I'll
take
care
of
that.
-
Okay,
thanks,
guys.
Norman,
they
can
take
you
I'm
not
going
to
the
hospital...
Honey,
I'm
so
sorry.
-
Thank
you.
You
know,
if
that
breaker
-
I
know.
Don't
worry,
Claire.
-
Okay.
you
might
want
to
think
-
Oh,
thank
you.
-
Bye-bye.
Call
me,
okay?
-
Oh.
I
called
you
last
night.
I
want
you
to
answer
Did
you
have
anything
to
do
Yes.
I
had
an
affair
with
her.
And
when
I
tried
to
break
it
off,
she
became
unstable.
She
came
out
here
to
the
house.
She
threatened
to
kill
herself...
or
you.
I
didn't
think
she'd
But
then
she--
she
disappeared.
It
was
her,
Norman.
-
Claire.
Are
you
saying
You
had
an
affair
with
a
girl
and
now
there's
a
presence
a
young,
blonde
girl.
Don't
you
get
it?
She's
dead,
and
now
-
We
don't
know
that
she's
dead.
It's
the
only
thing
Oh,
God.
Oh,
it's
my--
it's
my
fault.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
I
stole
a
braid
of
her
hair,
and--
-
And
it
gave
her
power.
There
are
no
ghosts.
It
was
an
accident.
I'm
fine.
It's
not
your
fault.
-
Yes.
"It
was
an
accident.
Say
it,
Claire.
I
need
to
go
lie
down.
I
didn't
sleep
last
night,
I
want
to
be
alone
for
a
while.
{y:i}
What's
the
name
of
that
friend
the
"who
you
gonna
call"
guy,
-
Holodnik.
Um,
could
you
contact
him
-
I'd
really,
uh,
like
{y:i}
Hello?
Yes,
this
is
he.
Thanks
for
calling
back.
Uh,
no,
sir.
Yeah,
he
passed
away
Yes,
he
was.
Thank
you.
Look,
the
reason
I'm
a
little
out
of
my
depth
someone
who's
very
close
to
me,
or
seems
to
be
in,
uh,
entity
or
spirit,
and--
No.
No,
there's
no,
um,
But,
well,
I
guess
is
it
possible
that
she
could
be...
causing
these
manifestations
some
kind
of
unconscious
Uh-huh.
Well,
is
there
anything
else
Uh-huh.
And
this
Oh.
Really?
Um,
listen,
I'm
sorry,
Can
I
call
you
back
Please.
Yes,
that'd
be
great.
Claire!
Claire!
Claire!

-
The
braid.
The
br--
-
What
braid?
What
-
Honey,
what
are
you
-
Is
that
what
-
What
is
this?

-
This
is
Madison
Fank's
hair?
What
do
you
think?
I
really
don't
know.
Norman.
Yes...
I
believe
you.
Hey,
Coop.
{y:i}*

{y:i}*
You're
playing.
She's
gone.
-
How
do
you
know?
I
picked
up
the
book
Claire,
I
don't
know
But
if
you
give
me
I
promise
you
I'll
spend
Please.
Last
sail
of
the
year.
-
Mm-hmm.
-
Stay
at
some
little

haven't
Adamant.
Adamant?
Yeah,
an
artsy
It's
supposed
to
be
charming.
No.
Maybe
we'll
stop
there
for
lunch.
What's
that
for?
Nothing.

Hmm.


Oh,
God.
You
don't
understand
Don't
I,
Norman?
You
killed
her,
didn't
you?
I
did
not.
I
didn't
kill
anyone.
Jesus,
Claire,
listen
to
me.
When
I
got
here,
She
killed
herself
here
Do
you
think
She
left
that
for
you
I
burned
the
letter,
A
week
before...
sh-she
showed
up
I
was
terrified.
She
insisted,
When
I
got
here,
I,
I
tried
to
revive
her,
There
was
nothing
So--
So
I
put
her
I
drove
and
I
rolled
it
{y:i}I
made
a
terrible
mistake.
But
tell
me,
Claire,
tell
me,
Should
I
sacrifice
everything?
My
work,
which
I've
Tell
me,
Claire.
'Cause
we
can
Our
life
can
go
on.
What
are
you
asking
me
to
do?
I'm
asking
you
to
forgive
me.
That
girl
must
be
brought
up.


Hello.
This
is
I
have
some
information
Madison
Fank,
yes.
Would
you
send
an
officer
It's,
um,
It's
about
a
mile
Okay.
Thank
you.
{y:i}
I'm
gonna
go
get
dressed.
{y:i}




Don't.

Stop
it!

-
Ow!






I
begged
you,
Claire.
I
pleaded
with
you.
But
you
wouldn't
let
it
go.

I
never
wanted
{y:i}All
I
ever
wanted
be
proud
of
me,
to
be
happy.

She
would
have
ruined
us.
Did
she
think
I
was
just
gonna
{y:i}You
have
no
idea
to
hold
her
underwater...
watch
her
life
slip
away.
But
she
gave
me
no
choice.
And
neither
have
you.
I
can't
figure
out
how
At
first,
I
thought
you
knew,
that
you
created
Then
I
realized
you
believed
it.
It's
a
passive-aggressive
First
time
I
met
you...
all
I
ever
wanted
was
to
spend
Not
gonna
happen
now.
Ooh,
too
cold,
huh?
{y:i}I
almost
froze
to
death
wet,
naked,
-
Hey,
Coop.

Let's
go
get
your
ball.

{y:i}
{y:i}Jody,

Norman.
It's
Norman.
Uh,

a
terrible
brawl.
Could
you
do
me
a
favor?
{y:i}Could
you
check
on
her
{y:i}I'm
terribly
worried
about
her.
Okay,
thanks.


I'm
sure,
in
some
tragic
way,
your
suicide
is
gonna
help
bring
And
every
time
I
look
at
her,
-
Oh,
God.
What's
this?
