Please,
help.
Somebody,
help.
-
Miss
Flores.
Come
on
in.
When
did
you
get
in?
A
couple
of
days
ago.
...hoping
they
might
know
the
whereabouts
our
tribe.
Any
luck?
Well,
Looks
like
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
suspect
...can
be
found
and
studied.
At
least,
that's
what
I
told
the
grant
people.
My
man
seems
to
think
that
the
tribe
was
somewhere
around
here...
...between
these
two
tributaries.
-
Well,
that's
good.
Well
you
get
me
there
and
I'll
shoot
it.
I'm
counting
on
that.
And
I'm
glad
you
did.
Well,
I
wanted
the
best
director
I
could
get.
I
think
we'll
make
a
good
team.
You're
a
mess.
Oh,
just
a
small
attack
of
piranha.
Somebody's
up
awfully
early.
Yeah,
well,
today's
a
good
day.
-
Is
that
right?
Not
every
day
my
homegirl
from
SC
get
to
direct
her
own
documentary.
You
ready?
-
I
think
so.
-
Congratulations.
I
see
you
made
this
a
pleasure
cruise.
Come
on,
you
know
me.
I
don't
mix
business
with
pleasure.
Okay,
well,
what
about
if
we
go
up
through
here?
This
way
better.
Okay,
well,
it's
only
55
kilometres
out
of
the
way.
Shouldn't
be
a
problem.
-
Morning.
-
Mateo,
you
understand
me?
Great.
I'm
gonna
need
you
to
drift
through
that
channel
over
there.
As
you
say,
chefe.
-
For
your
approval.
So
where's
Westridge?
He's
probably
just
catching
up
on
his
beauty
sleep.
Careful!
Careful!
Bordeaux.
Fragile.
Christ!
-
Morning.
Actually,
it
was
a
bloody
nightmare.
One
zoom
lens.
You.
Stow
this
in
my
room,
will
you?
Excuse
me?
I'm
not
the
bellhop,
I'm
the
production
manager.
Then
surely
you
can
manage
my
things
into
my
room.
-
One
pompous
ass.
...when
somebody
asks
you
to
carry
their
bags.
-
Respect
this,
sound
man.
-
Mr.
Westridge,
Terri
Flores.
Professor
Cale
lent
me
some
of
your
films.
I
thought
they
were
very
promising.
-
God,
it's
hot.
Are
we
on
the
equator?
Welcome
aboard,
I
guess.
-
I
think
he
likes
you.
Damn,
Cale,
you
look
like
a
little
low-budget-ass
Jacques
Cousteau.
Yeah,
well,
whatever
the
hell
that
means.
It's
good
to
see
you,
man.
Chefe,
ready
for
Rio
Negro.
All
right
everybody.
...and
pray
you
didn't
forget
your
bug
spray.
Our
adventure
begins
1000
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
mighty
Amazon...
...deep
in
the
heart
of
the
rain
forest.
From
here,
we
will
travel
by
river
barge...
...up
through
shallow
tributaries
and
unexplored
backwaters...
...in
search
of
the
elusive
people
of
the
mist:
The
Shirishama
tribe.
One
of
the
last
great
mysteries
of
the
rain
forest.
Is
it
just
me
or
does
the
jungle
make
you
really,
really
horny?
Oh,
no.
I
think
it's
the
jungle.
I'm
serious.
Can
I
work,
please?
Help!
Save
me!
I'm
stranded.
My
boat
is
stranded
in
the
roots.
Help
me!
Help
me!
Hello!
Check
it
out,
there's
a
dude
on
a
boat
over
there.
Hey!
Pull
over
to
his
boat.
Stop.
We'll
bring
you
onboard.
Here.
Thank
the
Lord
for
you.
You
hurt?
Are
you
okay?
My
propeller
tore
off
in
the
roots.
We
can't
take
you
back
to
Manaus.
At
the
next
village,
I
know
the
people.
-
I
sorry
if
I
be
trouble
for
you.
We're
all
at
the
mercy
of
our
machines.
Your's
broke.
Mateo?
Fish,
river-style.
Not
bad.
We're
gonna
have
to
get
that
on
film
next
time.
-
Ever
work
in
a
sushi
bar,
Mr?
Where
you
from,
Mr.
Serone?
-
Paraguay.
I
started
out
studying
for
the
priesthood...
...but
then
I
needed
to
see
the
real
world.
So
I
ended
up
in
the
jungle.
I
seem
to
fit.
Tell
me,
what
does
a
failed
priest
do
in
the
jungle?
Fail?
Who
says
I
fail?
I
didn't
fail.
-
I'm
sure
you
didn't.
-
Snakes.
I
catch
them.
For
zoos
and
collectors.
Poaching?
Poaching
is
illegal.
We
are
not
hunting
or
trapping
anything.
We're
making
a
documentary
on
the
Shirishama
Indians.
-
The
People
of
the
Mist?
I've
seen
them.
Really?
You
people
saved
my
life.
I
can
show
you
exactly
where
I
saw
the
Shirishama.
So
slurs
every
other
river
rat
after
Come
on,
lovey.
Five
whiskies?
That's
breakfast
on
the
river.
Well,
does
salad
go
well
with
fish
river-style,
Mr.
Serone?
Salad
would
be
perfect
little
baby
bird.
Okay.
Look
at
that.
What
are
those,
fireflies?
It's
pretty,
huh?
Family
Lampyridae.
On
certain
nights
they
all
gather
in
the
same
tree
and
use
their...
...night
flashes
to
announce
their
readiness
to
mate.
Well,
whose
flashes,
the
males
or
females?
Both,
actually.
The
females
with
a
series
of
short,
The
males
respond
with
a
series
of
long,
drawn-out
manly
flashes.
I
like
that.
No
pick-up
lines,
no
misunderstandings.
Just
instinct
and
nature.
I've
missed
you.
Shit.
Bloody
racket.
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Don't
touch
my
radio.
You
know,
I
could
cheerfully
hire
someone
to
kill
you.
A
local
tribesman,
perhaps.
-
I
could
just
kill
you
for
free
right
now.
-
You
and
whose
army?
So
are
we
getting
close?
Just
around
this
bend.
Perfect.
A
snake
totem.
This
totem
is
Shirishama.
Shirishama
worship
giant
snakes,
anacondas
as
gods,
protectors.
There's
a
legend
they
pass
down
of
a
journey
to
a
sacred
lake.
First
you
must
pass
a
waterfall
protected
by
warrior
snakes.
Once
you
pass
those
guardians...
...you
travel
through
the
land
of
the
Shirishama...
...until
you
come
to
a
wall
so
high,
it
blots
out
the
sky...
Follow
that
wall
for
five
days,
-
You
know
the
story.
Beautiful,
beautiful
legend.
I
believe,
however,
it's
a
legend
of
the
Maku.
Also
the
Shirishama.
Not
to
my
knowledge.
The
water
is
high
now,
but
the
village
was
right
here.
You'll
find
them
down
this
fork.
And
I'm
sure
you're
very
good
at
it.
I
locate
tribes
for
a
living
and
I'm
very
good
at
that.
The
water
level
is
high,
which
by
my
calculations
means...
...the
areas
to
this
side
will
be
flooded...
...which
would
force
our
tribe,
if
they
wanted
to
eat...
...to
seek
out
higher
ground.
Which
way?
We'll
go
this
way.
Westridge,
I
wanna
get
a
shot
of
you
with
the
totem.
-
Camera
rolling.
Our
first
piece
of
luck:
A
Shirishama
idol
I
know
what
I
know.
-
Leave
me
at
the
next
village.
With
pleasure.
What
the
hell
was
that
all
about?
We're
gonna
go
out
and
get
some
wild
sound.
Well,
just
be
careful.
We
will.
See
you
guys.
All
right.
Gary...
It's
unbelievable.
-
Gary?
Oh,
my
God.
No,
wait.
Do
you
hear
that?
The
silence.
Run,
Gary!
-
What
was
that?
Mateo,
shine
the
light
over
there.
These
two
are
fortunate
to
be
alive.
-
What
happened?
Man,
you
should
have
seen
it.
This
guy
just
blasted
this
thing
coming
right
at
us.
Wild
boar.
Gores
with
his
tusks.
-
Denise,
are
you
okay?
From
now
on,
everybody
stays
onboard
at
night,
all
right?
-
No
exceptions.
Mateo,
let's
cut
him
up.
Food?
-
My
turn?
-
No,
it
isn't.
Mateo,
do
you
have
control
of
this
vessel?
Lie,
if
you
must.
Mateo.
Goddamn
rope's
caught
in
the
propeller.
Well,
looks
like
I'm
gonna
have
to
cut
us
loose.
It's
maybe
better
I
do
it.
I
can
handle
it.
-
Okay.
Can
do
what?
Candiru
acu.
It's
a
tiny
little
catfish.
It
swims
up
into
your
urethra,
finds
a
nice
warm
spot...
...spreads
its
thorny
little
spines
and
refuses
to
budge.
You
have
to
cut
it
out.
That's
it,
man.
Terri,
something's
wrong!
Oh,
my
God.
Cale?
-
He's
hurt.
I'm
going.
Gary.
Hurry
up.
Come
on,
guys.
Come
on.
Steven?
Oh,
my
God.
Is
he
breathing?
Faster,
come
on.
-
Hurry.
-
Dan,
be
careful.
-
It's
okay.
Take
his
mask
off.
-
Get
something
for
his
head.
-
He's
not
breathing.
He's
not
breathing.
-
Something
for
his
head.
There's
something
in
the
mouth.
Oh,
dear
God.
Oh,
damn.
What's
that?
Oh,
God.
A
wasp.
Deadly.
Poisonous.
Well,
he's
still
not
breathing.
-
Oh,
God.
How
did
this
happen?
I've
got
whisky
in
my
flask.
-
Quickly.
-
He's
breathing.
He's
breathing.
Here.
He
seems
okay.
We
should
go
now.
Man,
that
radio
don't
work.
Hey,
I
can't
fix,
okay?
-
We
can
start
now.
Fog.
We
don't
get
this
man
to
a
hospital
soon...
...we
might
as
well
throw
him
in
the
river.
What?
Terri,
we
got
lights.
Good.
Mateo,
we're
just
gonna
double
back.
Fighting
the
current,
lose
two
days.
Cut
back
to
this
tributary,
save
us
50
miles.
This
is
the
route
you
suggested
we
take
yesterday.
Yesterday
for
a
different
reason.
Now
our
concern
is
getting
Professor
Cale
to
a
hospital...
...as
fast
as
possible.
Fine.
I
hope
you
know
what
you're
doing...
...because
I
don't
know
about
this
dude.
What
choice
do
I
have?
What
the
hell
is
this?
Hey,
Terri,
come
here.
This
is
the
river
you
know?
No,
this
is
new.
But
no
cause
for
panic.
I'm
not
panicking,
I'm
just
looking
at
this
wall...
...that's
blocking
our
way
down
this
river
that
you
know.
Well,
let's
just
see
what
we
can
do.
Hey,
is
that
real
dynamite?
-
It's
always
good
to
be
prepared.
Well,
you
gotta
be
kidding
me.
Yeah,
to
keep
us
out.
I'm
talking
about
upsetting
the
ecological
balance
of
this
river.
Well,
look,
I
can
blow
it
in
10
minutes...
...or
if
you
feeling
sensitive,
we
can
turn
around
and
lose
two
days.
It's
up
to
you.
Terri?
Oh,
for
God's
sake,
blow
the
bloody
thing.
Just
give
me
10
minutes,
people.
I'm
gonna
need
some
help.
-
There's
something
down
there.
-
No,
I
really
mean
it.
Hurry!
Shit.
Goddamn
it.
These
snakes.
Oh,
God.
Babies.
All
of
them
babies.
Well,
how
do
we
get
them
off
the
boat?
Come
on,
babies.
Come
on.
Some
of
these
aren't
babies.
Mateo,
there's
more
right
here.
Calm.
-
You
little
shit.
Someone
get
this
bloody
thing
off
my
freaking
hand!
Get
it
off!
So
young
and
yet
so
lethal.
Get
it
off
me.
Come
on.
Later,
sweetie.
You
knew
there
were
snakes
here,
didn't
you,
Serone?
It
was
a
pleasant
surprise.
What
about
the
fuel?
There's
only
one
drum
left.
That's
enough
for
about
100
kilometres.
About
a
day's
ride.
Go,
go.
Back
to
your
mother.
Hey.
Hi.
How's
he
doing?
-
He's
breathing
normally
now.
We'll
get
him
home.
I
just
don't
know
what's
going
on,
you
know?
Serone's
supposed
to
help
us
get
back
to
the
hospital,
right?
And
he
acts
like
he
owns
this
river.
And
we
run
into
a
barrier
full
of
snakes.
I
mean,
where
is
he
taking
us?
Mateo.
Mateo!
Stop
the
boat.
-
Stop
it.
Could
be
fuel.
You
know
that
boat?
There's
lots
of
boats
like
that.
Hello?
I
get
the
distinct
impression
there's
nobody
home.
Mateo?
Come
with
me.
Hold
up.
I'm
gonna
get
this
on
film.
-
You
don't
need
sound,
do
you?
Go
aft.
Serone?
-
Kind
of
spooky
in
here.
What
the?
Goddamn.
-
Help
me
with
this.
Treasures.
Here.
Hey,
be
careful.
Mateo,
that's
it.
Let's
go.
Hey,
I'm
coming.
I'm
coming.
What's
all
this?
There
wasn't
no
fuel.
-
Great.
I
don't
know.
Mateo!
-
I'm
going
back.
Maybe
some
other
time.
Asshole.
Stuck
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
and
now
we've
lost
the
driver.
Mateo.
Come
on,
man.
Stop
playing.
Danny?
Danny!
Danny?
-
Yeah.
I'm
all
right.
I
didn't
see
him.
How
very
reassuring.
Here,
this
is
it.
-
This
is
all
you
found?
-
What
the
hell
is
this?
-
There's
snakes
out
there
this
big?
Whatever's
shed
it
has
grown
since
then.
But
something
like
this
has
made
a
meal
of
our
dear
captain.
What?
-
Snakes
don't
eat
people.
Anacondas
are
a
perfect
killing
machine.
They
have
heat
sensors.
A
warm
body
like
Mateo's
in
the
water
wasn't
hard
to
find.
They
strike,
wrap
around
you,
hold
you
tighter
than
your
true
love.
And
you
get
the
privilege
of
hearing
your
bones
break...
...before
your
power
of
the
embrace
causes
yours
veins
to
explode.
-
No,
Mateo's
probably
just
lost.
Imagine
something
this
big,
captured
alive.
That's
worth
a
lot
of
money,
Gary.
Jesus.
Please,
people...
...don't
make
me
out
a
monster.
I
didn't
eat
the
captain
Mateo.
Come
on,
everybody.
We
are
not
sure
that
Mateo
is
dead.
-
So
we'll
just
wait
here
till
morning.
Where
do
you
think
he
went,
a
walk
in
the
woods?
Now
listen.
We've
got
to
get
the
hell
out
of
here.
-
Oh,
get
a
grip,
Westridge.
We
are
not
leaving.
Listen,
if
it
was
me
out
there,
I'd
be
dead,
don't
you
see?
Just
go
into
your
cabin
and
lock
the
door.
Like
a
bad
boy.
All
right.
All
right.
Where
are
my
shoes?
-
We're
gonna
aim
some
lights
at
the
boat.
Lights
are
a
good
idea.
I'm
not
so
sure
he
didn't
eat
the
captain.
He
sure
looks
satiated.
Think
he's
still
alive?
-
No.
Let's
go
to
bed.
Danger.
Danger
is
exciting,
huh,
Gary?
You
go
on
to
the
bed,
I'm
gonna
catch
up
to
you.
-
Gary,
come
on.
-
Well,
hurry
up,
I'm
scared.
-
So
it's
out
there,
isn't
it?
-
And
you
know
how
to
catch
these
things,
right?
But
you
can't
catch
an
anaconda
by
yourself.
Capture
alive
maybe
a
million
dollars,
Gary.
Still
no
Mateo.
Keep
it
steady,
Westridge.
Steady
it.
Man,
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
You
can't
catch
anacondas
without
bait.
Oh,
my
God.
-
Westridge,
let's
go.
Your
boat?
Gary?
She
speak
for
everybody?
Gary?
Well,
I
mean,
the
way
I
figure
it,
Why
not
salvage
something?
You
know,
let's
film
Serone
capturing
a
big
snake.
-
Have
you
lost
your
mind?
No,
I
haven't
lost
your
mind.
I
think
it's
you
guys
who
need
to
open
up
your
eyes.
Yo,
hold
up.
How
we
go
from
taking
Cale
to
the
hospital...
-
...to
catching
a
goddamn
snake?
You're
in
the
middle
of
the
jungle.
Okay,
all
you
guys
do
is
you
question
and
you
criticise...
...but
just
remember,
And
neither
do
I,
okay?
But
I
guarantee
you
I
know
who
does:
This
guy.
Paul
has
been
here.
And
if
we
help
him
catch
the
snake...
...then
he
will
help
us
get
out
of
here
alive.
And
that,
amigos,
is
not
insanity.
Come
on,
Gary,
this...
this
isn't
you.
-
Honey,
what
did
he
do
to
you?
Think
about
how
much
money
this
will
be
worth.
Imagine
capturing
something
like
this
on
film
for
the
first
time
ever.
-
Let's
be
honest.
What
else
are
we
supposed
to
do?
I'm
about
to
throw
both
of
you
son
of
bitches
in
the
river
myself.
-
I
don't
think
so.
-
Let's
go,
Westridge.
Gary.
Occupy
yourselves.
Nobody
move.
Gary!
Gary,
get
the
lights.
Westridge,
stop
the
boat.
Stop
it.
-
Get
it
over
here,
Westridge.
That's
it,
that's
it.
Go
for
the
eyes.
-
Go
for
the
eyes.
Blind
it.
He's
fishing
for
snakes.
Just
let
it
go.
Westridge,
come
here.
Danny!
Westridge.
Where
is
it?
Don't
move.
Denise,
get
up
here.
Get
up
here.
Gary,
help
me.
-
Get
out
of
there.
I'm
stuck.
Grab
her
hand.
The
snake,
it's
in
the
water!
-
Gary!
Gary,
give
me
your
hand.
Gary!
-
Gary!
It's
no
good
to
me
dead.
Gary!
Oh,
God!
Oh,
God!
Gary!
May
the
souls
of
the
faithful
departed...
...through
the
mercy
of
God
rest
in
peace.
Amen.
-
Westridge.
It
was
you
who
brought
that
snake.
You
brought
the
devil.
There's
the
devil
inside
everyone.
-
Get
your
hands
off
her.
-
Westridge!
Take
my
gear
up
to
the
pilot
house.
I'm
not
your
bloody
poodle.
What
you
say?
How
dare
you
presume
to
order
me
about?
Presume?
How
you
like
I
presume
to
throw
you
in
the
river?
Take
it
upstairs.
Thank
you.
Everyone
else,
don't
move.
Get
back.
Get
back.
Terri,
let's
talk.
You
want
something?
I
just
want
to
talk
to
you.
I
was
thinking
about
the
myth.
I
don't
know
if
you
know,
but
this...
This
film
was
supposed
to
be
my
big
break.
And
it's
turned
out
to
be
a
big
disaster.
Anyway,
I
was
just
thinking...
...that
maybe
I
could
film
you...
...capturing
the
snake
and
then...
...it
wouldn't
have
all
been
for
nothing.
I
don't
know.
It
could
be
dangerous.
Well,
I
know.
But
at
least
you'd
be
there
to
protect
us.
You
need
protection?
Yeah.
It's
been
a
long
time...
...since
I
had
a
woman.
You
think
I'm
stupid?
I'm
not
stupid.
-
It
worked.
-
Shall
I
hit
him
again
to
make
sure?
-
Haven't
we
had
enough
of
that?
Come
on,
let's
just
tie
him
up,
okay?
This
was
all
one
big
setup,
huh?
Mateo,
you
stranded...
...the
shipwrecked
boat,
your
route
to
the
hospital.
How
can
you
forget
about
the
wasp?
See,
what
you
do
is
not
so
hard.
I
can
trap
a
snake
too.
As
smart
as
you
are,
you
can't
survive
without
me.
Hey,
we're
gonna
be
home
soon,
okay?
I
can't
believe
how
good
you're
doing.
Is
it
hard
to
drive?
It's
a
doddle,
like
driving
a
Cadillac
Fleetwood.
Tell
you
what,
I'll
give
you
a
driving
lesson.
Right,
black
knobs:
Up
to
go
forward,
down
to
go
back.
Red
knobs:
Up
to
go
fast,
down
to
go
slow.
Wheel:
Four
turns
hard
over,
left
and
right.
If
you
get
into
trouble,
turn
off
the
ignition,
all
right?
-
Take
it
for
a
spin.
Take
us
back
to
civilisation.
Shit,
no
problem.
Take
us
back
to...
...crisp
sheets
and
hot
showers.
The
playoffs
and
a
six-pack.
Eighteen
holds
of
golf
and
a
quadruple
gin
and
tonic.
L.A.
Traffic
and
my
cellular
phone.
Don't
start.
The
waterfall.
It's
a
beautiful
sight,
baby
bird.
The
legend
was
right.
What
is
this
place?
Oh,
dear.
It's
absolutely
beautiful.
-
What
the
hell
was
that?
-
We
did.
Turn
the
wheel
hard
over
left.
Right.
Put
it
in
reverse.
Shut
it
down.
Shit.
We
got
to
winch
ourselves
loose.
Whoa,
what
are
you
doing?
-
I
mean,
we
have
to
get
in
the
water?
I
figure
me
and
you
go
over
here,
wrap
a
rope
around
that
tree.
You,
you
wrap
a
rope
around
that
tree.
Pull
it
tight.
We've
got
to
make
it
quick,
in
and
out.
I
rather
hoped
I'd
done
my
bit.
That's
our
rope
right
there.
-
Just
enough
to
go
around
the
tree,
right?
We'll
take
this,
get
it
around
that
trunk
right
there.
-
Make
sure
it's
secure.
-
Hate
this.
...I
was
up
all
night
picking
leeches
off
my
scrotum.
Aren't
you
gonna
pray?
Never
look
in
the
eyes
of
those
you
kill.
They
will
haunt
you
forever.
I
know.
I
firmly
resolve
with
the
help
of
thy
grace...
...to
confess
my
sins...
...and
to
amend
my
life.
Amen.
Sanctus,
Sanctus,
Sanctus...
...baby
bird.
Okay.
Hurry
up.
Shit.
Back
on
the
boat.
Now.
Come
on!
Go.
Christ.
Get
on
the
boat.
Go
on,
hurry.
-
Come
on.
Come
on.
-
Get
up.
All
right.
Get
up!
Over
here,
you
fat-assed
bastard.
Shit.
-
Westridge,
go
up
the
rocks.
Get
up
the
rocks!
It's
coming.
Go!
-
Go
get
the
gun.
Go
get
it.
Hurry
up.
Come
on,
man.
-
Westridge,
keep
going,
man.
Danny,
move
your
arm.
Westridge!
Look
out!
Danny?
Danny!
Danny!
Yeah?
Westridge?
Westridge?
Shit.
Come
on,
hurry
up.
I'm
caught.
Come
on,
Danny.
Hurry
up.
Come
on.
Danny!
No!
Danny!
Danny,
hold
on.
Hold
on.
Come
on.
You
killed
my
warrior
snake.
Get
up.
The
dart.
The
tranquillizer's
working.
Get
him.
Damn,
the
dart
came
out
his
back.
Come
on,
almost
there.
All
right.
Baby?
He's
lost
consciousness
again.
I'm
gonna
try
to
get
us
out
of
here.
-
The
tree
knocked
us
loose.
Hey,
Terri,
look.
They
might
have
some
fuel
for
us.
Let's
check
it
out.
-
Need
some
help?
I
don't
even
wanna
know
what
happened
here.
Me
neither.
I
hope
they
got
some
fuel,
though.
Damn.
Those
drums.
Could
be
fuel.
A
snake
skin.
-
Look,
there's
plenty
of
fuel
in
here.
Time
to
wake
up.
Monkey
blood.
I'm
gonna
kill
you,
Serone!
Don't
get
me
upset.
See
this?
Human
bones.
That's
how
it
comes
out.
Ashes
to
ashes...
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Look.
Up,
on
three.
Come
on.
Go.
Gotcha.
Come
on.
Get
loose.
Let's
get
the
fuel
and
get
the
hell
out
of
here.
Don't
worry,
just
go.
Run.
It's
coming
for
you.
Danny,
where
are
you?
-
There's
a
whole
nest
up
there.
-
No,
I've
got
the
legs.
Okay.
Go.
Go!
Hey!
Can
you
climb
up
the
top?
-
I
can
use
the
rope.
-
I'm
about
to
light
it.
-
Danny!
Danny!
-
Get
out,
the
fuse
is
lit.
Push
it
on
the
side!
Hit
the
hinges!
Hurry
up!
You
gotta
jump!
-
I
can't,
it's
too
high.
I
got
you.
Come
on.
Did
we
get
him?
Did
we
get
him?
We
got
him.
You
all
right?
Yeah.
We
should
get
the
fuel...
...so
we
can
get
the
hell
out
of
here,
all
right?
Come
on.
Come
on!
Bitch.
Let's
get
out
of
here.
Miss
Flores.
You're
a
mess.
Found
another
one.
Here,
let
me
see
that.
Shirishama.
Serone
was
right.
Danny.
Damn.
I'll
get
the
camera.
I
think
so.
-
Right.
Roll
film!
