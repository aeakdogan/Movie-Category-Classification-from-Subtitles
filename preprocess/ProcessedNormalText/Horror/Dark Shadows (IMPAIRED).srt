BARNABAS:
It
is
what
defines
us.
Binds
us.
Curses
us.
JOSHUA:
Come,
Barnabas.
BARNABAS:
For
some,
blood
means
For
others,
a
life
of
servitude.
WOMAN:
Angelique,
how
many
times
Remember
your
place.
BARNABAS:
...my
father
took
us
to
the
New
World
We
brought
English
industry
...and
built
a
fishing
business...
...the
likes
of
which
America
JOSHUA:
But
remember,
Barnabas,

BARNABAS:
As
our
business
grew,
...and
we
decided
to
put
down
We
spent
the
next
15
years
Collinwood.
But
not
everyone
shared

Let
me
hear
you
say
Angelique...
...I
am
sorry,
my
dear...
...but
you
would
be
hearing
a
lie.
WOMAN:
Arrogant
creatures,
down
you
go



BARNABAS:
Convinced
my
parents'
death
...I
became
obsessed
with
dark
magic
"Lo!
Above
the
gates
of
hell...
...he
found
a
single
letter.
A
letter
proclaiming
Satan's
true
name.
Mephistopheles."
But
even
then,
in
the
depths
For
I
had
found
my
one
true
love.
Promise
we'll
be
together
forever.
God
as
my
witness,
Josette...
...I
swear
it.
BARNABAS:
...all
the
hearts
I
could
have
broken...
...I
got
the
one
with
the
secret.
I
got
the
witch.
ANGELIQUE:
To
lend
his
heart
an
eye
Then
magic
shall
the
slighted
use
So
all
he
loves
will
Die
BARNABAS:
...my
beloved
Josette
wandered
...where
many
a
despondent
soul
Josette!
Josette!
Josette.
Help
me.
Josette!
What
have
you
done?!

BARNABAS:
...so
that
my
suffering
would
never
end.

There's
the
monster.
BARNABAS:
...Angelique
turned
the
townspeople
...and
condemned
me
to
suffer
BARNABAS:
...for
all
time.
BARNABAS:
Release
me!

This

was
designed
Now
they
got
a
staff
of
me.
Me
and
Mrs.
Johnson.
She's
about
as
useful
Still,
not

a
whole

after
them.
Come
again?

"Collinsport."
Never
got
that.
Who's
that?

Something
with
a

in
it.
One

the
real
important
ones
Back

His

was

Collins.
And
he
was

finest
man
Welcome
to
Collinwood.
You'll
have
to
imagine
us
The
house
has
some
200
rooms...
...most
closed
off
to
save
on

We
don't
even
go
in

are
only
seven
of

after
all.
My

and
I.
My

Roger,
and
his

David.
Willie,
who
you've
met.
Mrs.
Johnson
and
Dr.
Hoffman...
...who
I
suspect
is
sleeping
off
And
where
is
David's
mother,
Laura
was
lost
at
sea...
...when
David
was
5.
He's
had
a
rather
difficult
time
I
brought
Dr.
Hoffman
here
That
was
three
years
ago.
There
are
just
a
few
questions,
...that
were
not
on
the
application.
Of
course.
How
do
you
feel
about
the
president?
Never
met
him.
The
war?
I
don't
watch
television.
Do
you
think
the
sexes
should
be
equal?
Heavens,
no.
Men
would
become
unmanageable.
I
think
we'll
get
along
just
fine,
Vicky.
Please,

Hi,
pumpkin.
Fear
me
not,
drunkard.
You
shall
not
be
harmed...
...so
long
as
you
tell
me
Well,
here's
all
you
need
to
know.
See
me,
derelict.
Look
into
my
eyes...
...and
deliver
me

Awaken.
Well
done.
Now,
tell
me,
the
Collins
family...
...do
they
endure?
A-yuh.
There's
four
of
them.
Thank
heaven.
Pray,
what
month
is
it?
October.
That's
why
there's
pumpkins.
-
What
is
the
year?
Wait.
'21.
A-yuh,
1972.
1972?
Hear
me,
future-dweller.
You
shall
be
my
loyal
servant...
...until
such
time
as
I
release
you.
So,
what
first,
master?
You
will
cleanse
me,
miscreant.
And
then
you
will
take
me
Okay.

BARNABAS:
WILLIE:
The
perfect
marriage
...and
American
enterprise.
Nine
of
the
finest
craftsmen
...lost
digit,
limb
and
life...
...in
the
process
of
carving
And
they
all
considered
it
The
opulence
and
complexity
...should
only
be
found
The
fireplace...
...sculpted
entirely
of
the
most
...from
Firenze,
Italia...
...each
joint
containing
a
single
pearl.
Are
you
stoned
or
something?
They
tried
stoning
me,
my
dear.
It
did
not
work.
When
did
they
start
allowing
DAVID:
-
Look.
Uncanny,
is
it
not?
Worth
every
hour
I
spent
posing.
Forgive
me.
I'm
David
Collins.
-
Are
we...?
Distantly,
you
might
say.
It
is
a
pleasure
to
make
your
acquaintance,
Children!
Get
away
from
that
man.
DAVID:
And
I'm
pretty
sure
ELIZABETH:
A
word,
please.
If
this
is
some
kind
of
ajoke,
If
it's
money
you're
after,
But
whoever
you
are,
you're
not
to
look
Your
devotion
to
family...
...is
admirable,
madam.
And
your
suspicion...

...understandable.
A
stranger
arrives...
...claiming
to
be
a
distant
relation.
The
question
of
motive
As
a
Collins...
...surely
you
are
aware
of
the
darkness
You
mean
our
curse.
Witches,
ghosts
and
vampires.
Myths.
And
like
so
many
before
you...
...I
suppose
you're
here
For
a
price,
of
course.
-
I
can
prove
that
I
am
different.
Firstly,
I
do
not
come
seeking
money.
Rather,
to
provide
it.
Secondly...
...I
know
the
body
of
this
mansion
Every
nook...
...every
corner...
...every
secret!
That's
where
I
keep
my
macram.
A
disgraceful
misuse.
Impressive.
But
there
are
plenty
of
old
houses
I
hope
you
have
a
"thirdly."
Indeed.
Tell
me...
...what
do
you
know...
...of
Barnabas
Collins?
Just
legends,
really.
He
was
confident
and
strong.
Admired
by
all.
But
he
believed
our
family
was
cursed...
...and
when
his
parents
were
killed,
Went
around
insisting
that
a
witch
And
what
is
known
of
his
death?
Nothing.
Not
that
I
can
think
of.
That,
madam...
...is
because
he
never
died.

I
am
Barnabas
Collins.
That
means
you're...
A
vampire,
madam.
Yes.
And
most
regrettably
so.
But
more
importantly,
I
am
a
Collins.
And
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor:
Neither
you
nor
any
under
this
roof
My
father
had
quite
a
flair

As
a
boy,
I
took
it
upon
myself
But
this
one...
This
one
was
always
my
favorite.
"Family
is
the
only
real
wealth,"
Though
clearly...
...he
was
not
opposed
to
other
kinds.
ELIZABETH:
We've
been
sitting
on
top
of
a
fortune
Know
this:
I
mean
to
stay.
I
mean
to
be
a
part
of
this
family
again.
On
one
condition.
Yes.
Promise
me
that
this...
...all
of
this,
will
remain
our
secret.
So
be
it.
Partners.
Welcome
home,
Barnabas
Collins.
I
was
awakened...
...by
a
yellow
dragon
with
iron
teeth.
Confronted
by
a
giant
letter
M
He's
not
staying
with
us
forever,
is
he?
DAVID:
Yes,
well,
I'm
sure
things
So,
Barnabas,
what
sort
of
business
The
Collins
family
has
always
been
But
after
two
centuries
...I
have
decided
to
devote
...to
family.
He
means
it
seemed
like
two
centuries.
Morning.
Who
the
hell
is
this?
Dr.
Hoffman,
this
is
our
distant
relative,
The
Third.
Barnabas
Collins
III
Barnabas?
Dr.
Julia
Hoffman.
My
God...
...a
woman
doctor.
What
an
age
this
is.
Is
he
for
real?
I
think
he's
just
tired
from
his
long
trip.
I
see
that
you
have
grown
...to
sell
off
the
prized
family
silverware.
How
could
you
tell?
Had
this
fork
been
real
silver...
...my
hand
would
have
burst
into
flames
Yes,
you
mentioned
Anyway,
the
fishing
business
The
manor
is
nearly
in
ruins.
Well,
I
have
returned.
And
in
short
order,
Huh.
Good
luck.
Angie
has
deals
-
"Angie"?
They've
taken
just
about
every
port
Then
that
is
where
my
work
begins.
...I
shall
restore
the
family
business
Josette.
DAVID:
She
believes
in
ghosts,
like
me.
VICTORIA:
Enchanted.
Surely
you
do
not
let
them
A
name
like
Victoria
is
so
beautiful...
...I
could
not
bear
to
part
Yeah,
well...
...money
might
grow
on
trees
...but
it's
a
little
harder
to
come
by
here.
Do
not
concern
yourself
I
should
like
to
see
the
factory
immediately.
We
don't
have
horses.
We
have
a
Chevy.
WOMAN:
MAN
1:
Morning,

of

seamers
blew

it
an
hour.

looks
like
Tell
you
the
truth,

think
they're

little

What
do
you
mean?
They
found
11
workers
dead
in

woods

It
wasn't
an
accident.

off
Route
9?

Yeah,

it's

Keep
your
damn
panties...
...on.
A
word
with
Barnabas
Collins,
please.
Oh,
he's,
um...
Who?
Oh,
I
think
you
know
who.
Black
hair,
handsome
features.
Strange
clothes
covered
in
fresh
blood.
My,
we've
let
this
place
go
to
hell,
Right
where
it
belongs.


You
must
be
Carolyn.
You're
like
a
hungry
tiger
We're
growing
into
ELIZABETH:
Elizabeth.
You're
looking
well.
And
to
what
do
we
owe
the
pleasure?
I'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
town
council
He's
asleep,
I'm
afraid.
During
the
day?
How
odd.
BARNABAS:
Barnabas,
we
have
a
guest.
My
apologies,
madam.
You
must
think
me
a
fright.
Miss?
ANGELIQUE:
My
name
is
Angie
Bouchard.
So
it
is.
Do
you
know
what
I
would
very
much
I
can
only
imagine.
I
would
very
much
like
to
have
a
word
With
your
permission,
Elizabeth.
How
dare
you
defile
my
manor
ANGELIQUE:
It's
really
you.
How
dare
you
place
I
remember
this
place
I
also
remember
the
two
of
us
Here...

...and...
...here.
Have
you
any
idea
You
killed
the
woman
I
love
Barnabas,
get
over
it.
Locked
in
a
box
for
200
years!
Don't
exaggerate,
it
was
only
196.
It
was
an
eternity.
I
shall
have
you
tried
for
witchcraft

Poor,
sweet
Barnabas.
Things
have
changed
My
Angelbay
is
Collinsport
now.
So
you
are
the
one
who
has
sent
They
love
me
here.
I'm
the
only
big
fish
left
Is
that
so?
And
do
the
good
people
of
Collinsport
...is
a
whore
of
Beelzebub?
Heh.
Do
you
really
think
anyone
I've
been
an
upstanding
member
...in
one
form
or
another.
Your
name
may
have
changed,
Harlot
of
the
devil.
Vulgar...!

The
people
of
Collinsport
And
to
them...
...you're
just
a
stranger
Welcome
back
to
the
shadows,
I've
missed
you.
Angelbay.
The
very
audacity
of
the
name
summons
I
always
knew
there
was
something
off
Indeed.
But
a
witch
with
Hate?
No,
if
she
merely
hated
you,
A
curse
takes
devotion.
Why
must
I
alone...
...bear
the
rotten
fruit
My
parents,
taken.

My
true
love,
taken.

And
what
did
you
do?
I
attempted
to
throw
myself
from
a
cliff.
Tragically,
to
no
avail.
And
then...
...I
became
a
vampire...
...and
started
to
kill


Yes...
...but
you
also
kept
...and
tried
to
keep
the
manor
Yes.
Yes,
I
did,
didn't
I?
You
fought
on,
Barnabas.
In
your
own
crazy
and
miserable
way,
...until
they
had
to
drag
you
away
...to
keep
you
from
fighting.
You
fought
on
In
our
blood,
madam.
And
now
you
have
a
chance
And
fight
I
shall.


Just
the
same
for
you
and
me
All
I
need
will
be
mine
if
you
are
here
I'm
on
the
top
of
the
world
looking
down
What
sorcery
is
this?
Reveal
yourself,
tiny
songstress!





You
want
fishermen,
He's
got
the
ear
of
every
captain
They
call
him
the
Excuse
me.
Captain
Clarney?
Captain
Clarney,
Collins?
And
why
does
a
Collins
To
offer
you
a
contract.
I
have
a
contract...
...with
Angelbay.
And
if
I
told
you
Then,
Mr.
Collins,
I
would
tell
you
There
is
such
a
thing
as
loyalty
I
see.
Mr.
Clarney...
...you
have
grown
rather
weary
In
fact,
you
would
rather
...than
sell
another
fish
Do
you
understand?
I...
...understand.
Very
good.
Now...
...if
you
would
be
so
kind
...to
some
of
your
fellow
captains...


Barnabas?
Why
are
you
What
is
that
thing?
JULIA:
It
looks
like
a
pulsating
blood
urn.
I
think
it's
time
I
showed
you
JULIA:
Regrettably,
the
word
is
foreign
to
me.
May
I
assume
it
is
some
species
It's
a
medical
doctor
that
specializes
-
I'm
a
psychiatrist.
Now,
where
were
you
born?
-
Liverpool.
Filthy.
The
air
is
choked
with
soot
...of
freshly
hurled
chamber
pots.
The
smell
of
urine
permeates
the
air.
Have
you
any
experience
I
find
it
very
useful,
yes.
Yes,
I
agree.
You
see...
...sometimes
we
make
up
...to
help
us
erase
horrible
memories
I
find
hypnotism
cuts
through
all
that.
I
employ
it
for
other
purposes.
May
I
hypnotize
you,
Barnabas?
Madam...
...I
do
not
believe
that
remotely
possi...
Good.
Now...
...l'd
like
you
to
tell
me
a
few
things.
A
vampire?
ELIZABETH:
What
on
earth
are
you
talking
about?
Oh,
spare
me.
Barnabas?
There's
a
point
where
delusions
fail,
He
told
me
everything...
...including
that
you've
known
-
Why
didn't
you
say
anything?
Oh,
by
letting
a
vampire
He
admitted
killing
those
men
-
He's
a
murderer.
...and
these
days,
Oh,
yes,
I
almost
forgot,
You
know,
Julia,
I'm
surprised
at
you.
I'd
think
a
physician
like
you
Well,
sure.
Medically,
psychologically
Which
is
exactly
why
I
came
to
you
Then
be
fascinated,
Julia.
And
if
you
have
an
ounce
of
love
...keep
your
mouth
shut.
CAROLYN:
I
don't
feel
comfortable
BARNABAS:
I
simply
seek
advice
on
the
art

And
who
better
to
tutor
me
What
is
your
age,
if
I
may?
-
Fifteen.
You
must
put
those
birthing

your
womb
shrivel
up

die.
You're
weird.
But
do
you

You
obviously
mean
Vicky.
She
has
the
most
fertile
birthing

You're
way
too
weird.
Do
you
really
think
so?
You're
all
stiff,
proper
and
old-fashioned.
And
Victoria...
...is
she
not
proper?
She
likes
to
pretend
she's
rock
'n

roll.
She's
a
Carpenters
kind
of
chick
for
sure.
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
she

That's
what
they
say
about
us.
Where
I'm
from...

love
of
a

is

And
if
the

is

enough...

absolutely

BARNABAS:
I
am
reminded
of
a
line...
...from
Erich
Segal's
wonderful
novel,
"Love
means
never
having
to
say...
...you
are

Heh.


JULIA:
Theoretically,

my

I
should
warn

isn't
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
You
must
have
faith,
doctor...
...for
if
a
man
can
become
a
monster,
But
why
become
a

Barnabas?
Why
give
up
the
gift
of
eternal
youth?
Look
at

We'll
be
lucky
if
we
see

He's
a

idolizes

Between

I
can

Because

Impossible.

have
made

Now,
we
can
either

we

be

was
really
angry
at
you

it
was
fun...

And
yes,
it

once
begged

I
must
admit,
I'm
willing
to
start
over,
Barnabas.
I'm
willing
to
call
a
truce
I
am
not
as
I
once
was.
I
could
change
that.

if
I
refuse?

Yes.
Seems

is

drink

where
does
it
come?

to

have

done

enough

makes

gonna
offer
you

you
agree

I
put
you

everybody,
stand
back!
Oh,
boy.
Sheriff,
we
need
to
talk.
Christ,
Angie,
I
ain't
got
time
for
chitchat.
You
don't
have
time
for
proof
that
BARNABAS
:
...and
the
workmen
and
those
Well,
I'll
be
damned.
And
to
think
the
whole
town's
I'd
be
willing
to
bet
that
Barnabas
And
I'd
be
willing
to
bet...
...that
you'll
find
the
corpses
of
The
Collins
family
has
rebuilt
Well,
I
say,
not
in
my
town!

There's
one
of
them
now!
He's
probably
the
one
who
started
the
fire
-
Time
to
go.



Willie.
What
on
earth's
happened?
Fire.
Murder.
Angry
mob.
Run!
ELIZABETH:

SHERIFF:
...l'm
sorry.
We're
gonna
have
to
take
you
in.
All
of
you.
Bill...
...the
Collins
family
built
this
town.
We
built
it
with
our
boats
and
our
nets.
With
our
sacrifices
and
our
blood.
And
this
is
how
you
repay
us?
You've
been
harboring
a
murderer.
Arrest
them.
I
shall
go
willingly...
...to
whatever
punishment
awaits...
...provided...
...no
harm
befalls
my
family.
Hold
it
right
there.
BARNABAS:
...Miss
Bouchard
goes
along
with
me...
...for
she
is
no
less
a
monster
than
I.
Perhaps
it
is
best...
...if
we
are
both
destroyed.

Mr.
Collins,
back
off!
I'm
warning
you!


Go
on,
slaughter
me.
Show
them
what
you
are.
No.
I
shall
show
them
what
we
are.
ANGELIQUE:
WOMAN:
It's
not
him,
it's
her.
She's
a
witch.


Excuse
me.
You
gotta
get
through
me
first,
lady.


-
Nothing
to
see
here.
You
should've
loved
me,
Barnabas.
None
of
this
would've
happened
I
should
have
destroyed
you.
I
gave
you
my
heart!
You
have
no
heart.
You're
the
curse!
Women
are
undone
by
loving
you.
Josette,
Dr.
Hoffman.
I
command
you
to
release
her
"Command"?
You
make
me
sick.
Missed
me.
Vulgar,
hideous
serpent,


Get
out
of
my
room!
Angelique!
Get
out
of
my
house.
Your
house?




Enough
trickery.
I
worshipped
you.
Plagued
me.
Adored
you!
BARNABAS:
Fine.
If
Collins
blood
built
this
house...
...then
let
us
bathe
in
it.




Leave
us
alone.
Carolyn?
Carolyn,
my
God.
I'm
a
werewolf,
okay?
Woof.

What
have
you
done
to
my
daughter?
Well,
Liz...
...your
perfect
Collins
pedigree
...so
I
sent
the
werewolf
Just
like
I
made
David
...when
I
sent
his
mommy
to
the
ocean
floor
And
as
for
you,
my
love...
...I
killed
your
mother
and
father.
I
cursed
your
family,
my
Barnabas.
They
kept
us
apart.
They
never
understood,
we're
the
same.
We're
meant
to
be.
DAVID:
I
think
I'll
kill
you
first,
orphan.
David,
get
out!
Your
quarrel
is
with
me.
My
quarrel
is
with
all
of
you.
I'm
warning
you.
This
is
your
last
chance.
Let
us
go.
And
what
will
you
do
if
I
don't,
Not
me.
My
mom.

Go!
David,
come
on.
Willie,
come
on.
So
this
is
how
it
ends.
So
quiet...
...as
if
you
were
asleep.
You
know,
there
was
a
time
We
could
have
spent
eternity
together.
We
still...
...can.
You
never
wanted
my
love.
You
wanted
to
possess
me.
No.
I
love
you,
Barnabas.
You
cannot
love,
Angelique.
That
is
your
curse.

Take
it.
BARNABAS:
Victoria!
She
said
Widow's
Hill.
What
do
we
do
now?
What
we've
always
done.
Endure.
BARNABAS:
You
have
lost
me.
I
live
in
the
light,
Barnabas.
You
live
in
the
shadows.
I'll
grow
old
and
die,
We
will
find
a
way,
my
love.
There's
only
one
way.
No.
I
will
not
see
you
suffer
as
I
do.
No!
Oh,
Victoria.
My
sweet
Victoria.
Victoria.
Josette.
BARNABAS:
It
is
what
defines
us.
Binds
us.
Curses
us.
My
name
is
Barnabas
Collins...
...and
my
curse
has
finally
been
broken.

DAVID:
You
ruined
it!
-
Carolyn,
enough.
The
initial
desire
to
take
Dark
Shadows
...is
the
idea
of
this
highly,
highly
The
Collins
family
is
odd.
That
family
in
the
The
weird
family.
BURTON:
We
kind
of
needed
things
to
have
Children!
BURTON:
It's
a
non-average
family,
BURTON:
There
are
people
I
felt
could

That
was
a
strange
sort
of

Angelique!
Get
out
of
my
house.
BURTON:
...and
it
was
the
same
with
Michelle.
You

Catwoman,
which
was
actually

anybody
I've
worked
with.
PFEIFFER:
...he
thought
about
the
weird
factor...
...which
of
course
I
love
She
understands
that
type
of
comedy.
How
soon
can
the
horses
be
ready?
We
don't
have
horses.
We
have
a
Chevy.
We
do
these
dinner
and
breakfast
scenes
The
whole
family
is
there.
It's
a
family
He's
not
staying
with
us
forever,
is
he?
Tim
and
I
were
going
for
the
idea
...where
everyone
sat
down,
Carolyn!
The
silence
in
the
scene
meant
so
much
MORETZ:
She's
this,
like,
Alice
Cooper-loving...
...Steve
Miller
Band-listening
hippie.
"Oh,
my
gosh,
it's
just
teenage
angst."
You

he
really
has
found

You

Yeah,
they're

She
hates
me,
I
hate
her,
heh.
Oh,
jeez.
We're
not
getting
along.
Carolyn,
this
is
Ms.
Winters.
Please,
call
me
Vicky.
Victoria

character
that

I
can
tell,
you
know.
Yours
says:
"I

secrets."
BURTON:
Bella
looks
like
a
person
That's
why
she
was
just
the
right
person
It's
really
fun.
...I
haven't
shot
Josette
and
Vicky
But
it's
kind
of
great,
It
makes
it
a
lot
easier
to
play
I
was
gonna
scare
you.
Were
you
scared?
Terrified
beyond
belief.
BARNABAS:
It's
been
20
minutes.
Vicky
relates
to
David
BURTON:
...is
Gully
looks
like
a
kid
MILLER:
Tore
us
to
pieces
in
one
scene
...and
I
got
really
jealous.

This
is
the
best
first
film
I
could've
been
in.
...and
extremely
witty
and
funny.
What
have
I
told
you
Those
are
Egyptian
cotton.
Exactly
what
I've
been
saying.
BURTON:
Jonny
Lee
Miller
Not
even
knowing.
I
don't
think
he
knew
He's,
like,
one
of
my
favorites
in
it.
MILLER:
It's
nice
to
play
someone
...and
a
bit
of
an
idiot,
Because
I'm
not
an
idiot
at
all,

Chop-chop,
Willie,
I'm
starving.
And
God
help
me

Awaken.
HALEY:
Willie's
kind
of
somewhat
In
this
version,
He's
quite
different
than
the
Willie
Loomis
BURTON:
Many
years
ago,
Jackie
sent
me
...and
I
was
sort
of
blown
away
by
it.

HALEY:
I
definitely
looked
at
a
lot
of
drunk
people
He's
a
murderer.
McGRATH:
She
was
only
supposed
to
be
there
...and
she's
been
there
ever
since.
She's
overstayed
her
welcome.
You're
the
doctor.
Yeah.
And
you're
"the
nanny,"
DEPP:
We've
done
about
15,000
Without
even
saying
anything
...we
almost,
like,
BURTON:
...to
be
offered
the
role
...but
somebody's
gotta
do
it,
right?
He
saw
me
as
the
alcoholic
psychiatrist

DEPP:
I
don't
know
how
many
times
Tim
constantly
has
me
killing
his
wife
I
don't
know
what
that
means.
I
know
that
Tim
is
so
thrilled
I
think
it's
probably
the
most
fun
Tim
actually
would
sometimes
laugh
It
won't
happen
again.
Because
everybody
was
so
funny
BURTON:
Luckily,
at
the
end
of
it
all,
...for
me,
was
like
a
Dark
Shadows
person
