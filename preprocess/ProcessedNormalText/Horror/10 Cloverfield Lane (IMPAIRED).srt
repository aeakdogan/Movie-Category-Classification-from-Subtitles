Michelle,
please
don't
hang
up.
Just
talk
to
me,
okay?
I
can't
believe
you
just
left.
Michelle
Come
back.
Please
say
something.
Michelle?

Talk
to
me.
Look,
we
had
an
argument,
couples
fight,
No
reason
to
just
leave
everything
behind.
Running
away
isn't
going
to
help
anything.


In
the
wake
of
this
afternoon's
widespread
blackout..
There
has
been
some
inclement
weather
in
the
region,
Problems
seem
linked
to
what

That
has
crippled

Okay,
ok
..
please.
Please
..
Please
don't
hurt
me.
Please,
Just
let
me
go,
okay?
I
won't
tell
anybody,
Please
just
let
me
go.

Please.
You
need
fluids.
You
were
in
shock.
What're
you
going
to
do
to
me?
I'm
going
to
keep
you
alive.
Work
on
getting
handy
with
these.
My
boyfriend
was
expecting
me.
He'll
send
the
cops
looking.
I'm
sorry
..
But
no
one
is
looking
for
you.
You
got
some
fight
in
you.
I
can
respect
that.
But
don't
even
think
about
trying
that
again.
You're
lucky
to
be
here
at
all.
My
generosity
only
extends
..
so
far.
Eggs,
Tylenol
to
help
with
your
pain.
Please
..
please
..
just
let
me
go.
-
Please.
That
looks
pretty
.
Given
it
as
how
I
saved
your
life,
You're
lucky
to
be
here
at
all.
-
What
do
you
mean?
And
I
saved
your
life,
by
bringing
you
here.
I
don't
understand,
There's
been
an
attack.
What?
An
attack.
A
big
one.
I'm
not
sure
yet
if
it's
chemical,
or
nuclear.
But
down
here
we're
safe.
And
where
are
we,
exactly?
Underneath
my
farmhouse.
40
miles
outside
of
Lake
Charles.
-
I
..

was
driving
north
of
here.
You
were
turned
over
on
the
side
of
the
road.
I
saved
your
life,
Michelle.
I
couldn't
just
leave
you
there.
Thank
you
so
much,
for
saving
my
life.

I
..
I
guess
I
should,
I
should
go
to
a
hospital,
now.
You
can't
leave.
An
attack
means
all
of
them.
Which
contaminates
the
air
above
ground.
How,
how
long
do
we
have
to
wait
until
it's
safe?
Depends
on
the
proximity
to
the
closest
blast.
And
that's
if
we're,
we're
talking
Russians
were
developing
some
nasty
stuff.
Their
weapons
will,
will
make
our
nukes
Luckily,
I
prepared
for
this.
I
need
to
use
your
phone,
then,
To
call
my
family.
-
And
make
sure
they're
okay.
How
do
you
know
that?
Everyone
outside
of
here
is
dead.
What
about
you?
No
Who's
that?
Excuse
me.
What
is
it
now?
Wait.
You
know
what,
Michelle?
You
need
to
eat,
you
need
to
sleep,
And
you
need
to
start
showing
me
a
My
name
is
Howard,
by
the
way.
God,
oh
shit.
I'm
sorry,
Sorry
about
that.

I
didn't
mean
to
..
Scare
you.
You,
hmm,

hmm,
you
hungry?
So
how're
you
doing,
huh?

You
okay?
What
is
this?
It's
a
bunker.
Your
room
is
a
bit
of
a
fixer-upper,
but
..
At
least
you
got
the
door.
A
scary
door,
but
you
still
got
the
door.
How
long
have
you
been
down
here?
A
couple
of
days,
I
think.

You
know,
No
windows,
the
sunlight,
and
everything.
I
mean,
how
do
we
get
out
of
here?
He
didn't
tell
you?
About
..
Getting
out
of
here,
Cause
the
air
out
there,
It's
contaminated.
I
see
you've
met
Emmett
-
What
happened
to
him?
And
his
stumbling
around
isn't
helping
anything.
What
you
heard
earlier,
Was
him
knocking
over
a
shelf
with
Which
he's
sorry
for,
correct?
Totally.
Let's
go.

Bathroom
time.
This
is
the
common
are.

Good
for
R&R.
As
you
can
see,
I've
planned
for
a
long
stay.
The
applaponic
system
cleans
This
is
the
living
room.
If
you
like
to
watch
films,
I
have
some
on
DVD
and
VHS
cassette.
Just
make
sure
you
put
them
back
The
kitchen
is
fully
functional.
There's
Freezer,
silverware.
And
that
table
is
a
family
heirloom,
Always
use
coasters
and
placemats.
Keep
you
hands
to
yourself!
Understand?
No
touching.
Take
a
seat.
This
way.
This
is
my
private
space
Off-limits,
Go
ahead.
-
Nah,
I
don't
need
to.
And
I've
got
to
pace
these
things
out,
-
I
need
privacy.
I
can't
with
you
standing
there.
And
I
can't
trust
you
not
to
burn
this
I'm
not
some
..
pervert.

Just
go.
Don't
flush
unless
you've
gone.
Can't
afford
wasting
flushes.
Take
a
seat.
Are
you
hungry?
Those
are
Megan's.
She
never
went
anywhere
without
two
Who's
Megan?
Megan's
not
with
us
anymore.
Don't
worry.

Just
the
generator.
Maybe
it's
a
car
up
front.
-
That's
not
possible.
Above
my
room.
If
you
had
heard
a
car,
Shouldn't
we
at
least
try
-
Someone
to
find
out
what
actually
happened?
See
that?

Nothing's
coming
through.
You
think
I
sound
crazy.
It's
amazing,
you
people..
You
wear
helmets
when
you
ride
your
bikes,
You're
in
your
cars,
But
what
do
you
do
when
those
alarms
go
off?
Crazy,
is
building
your
ark
after
I
think
now
might
be
time
you
Closest
I
can
get
to
in
airlock.
See?
What
happened
to
them?
They
weren't
as
lucky
as
you.
It's
the
air,
Michelle.
That's
what
happens
when
you
get
exposed.
I
keep
this
door
sealed,
at
all
times.
No
one
comes
in
or
out.
Met
Frank
and
Mildred,
huh?
It's
funny,
right?
The
whole
world
ends.

And
the
thing's
he's
You
gonna
need
some
..
uh,
reading
material.
That's
all
there
is
,
sorry.
My
idead
of
how
to
learn
to
do
If
you
want
me
to
do
that
for
you,
What
do
you
know
about
him?
He
was
in
the
Navy,
I
know
that.
I
guess
he
did,
uh,
What
kinds
of
stuff?
Satellite
..
stuff.
And
what
brought
him
out
here?
I'm
not
sure.
He
bought
this
property
a
whle
back.
I
never
paid
much
attention,
until
he
The
work,
was,
uh..
Entertaining,
though,
that's
for
sure.
You
know,
Howard,
is
like
a
black
belt
Plus,
you
know,
how
often
do
you
get
He
..
kidnapped
you?
No.
What
happened
to
your
arm?
I
was
trying
to
get
in.
And
I
watched
Howard
build
this
He
was
always
talking
about..
you
know,
possible
attacks,
Al-Qeda,
Russia,
South
Korea,
-
You
mean
North
Korea?
Yeah,
that
one.

Hmm
..
And,
hmm,
you
know.
Pour
all
his
money
into
this
Which,..
you
know,
That
stays
with
you.
So,
He
told
all
this,
While
you're
building
his
bomb
shelter,
And
now
he
says
that
..
The
air
is
contaminated,
and
everybody's
dead.
Yeah,
I
know
what
you're
getting
at.
Howard
abducted
me.
He
drove
me
off
the
road,
So
whatever
he's
telling
you
-
Some
big
attack.
The
purpose
of
this
shelter,
is
a
lie.
The
attack,
I
saw
it
myself.
What
do
you
mean?
Coming
on
my
way
from
work,
And,
looked
like
a
flash.
Bright
red,
Like
an
explosion,
from
way
far
off.
Wasn't
like
fireworks,
No,
it
was
more
this
like
something
So
what
you
saw
was
a
flashing
light?
-
Fire
that
cleared
up?
This
wasn't
like
anything
I've
ever
seen.
Right
here,
Above
us.
Did
you
hear
someone?
Right
over
me
.
That's
impossible.
-
The,
the
air,
is
..
-
How
do
you
know
that?
Dinner's
ready.
I
see
you
two
are
getting
along?
How's
that
sauce?
-
It's
fine,
Not
great,
but
okay.
Megan
was
a
good
cook.
You'll
learn
a
little
cooking.
It's
delicious.
It's
the
best
sauce
I
ever
tasted.
Are
you
being
funny?
No,
I
mean
..
Considering
the
alternative,
Get
burned
up
in
a
chemical
I
say
being
alive,
and
down
here
is
..
It's
made
a
fried
turd
taste
Best
damn
sauce
I
ever
had.
and

you
point,
Right.
You
know
what
I
haven't
been
able
to
Ever
since
I
got
down
here,
Tatoos.
I
always
wanted
one.
But
I
never
got
any.

Because
everyone
always
said,
nah,
no,
Whatever
Like
that
matters
now,
right?
Tell
you
what,
I
had
know
this
was
coming,
That's
where
I'm
at.
I
would
look
like
a
circus
freak
or
something.
Everywhere,
face,
shirt,
right
there.
Just
my
name,
Emmett.
Or,
you
know..
-
"Thug
Life"
-
'YOLO'
I
don't
even
know
what
that
means,
but,
I
hear
Hey,
what
about
you,
Howard?
Anything
you
wish
you'd
done?
In
all
honesty,
no.
No?
No
crazy
nights
in
Vegas?,
Maybe,
ah,
take
a
pilgrimage
to
Waco?
Everything
I
wanted
to
do,
I
did.
I
focused
on
being
prepared.
And
I
was.
And
here
we
are.
Oh,
my
goodness..
Is
that
Monopoly?
There
we
go.
Yeah,
that's
how
we
kill
the
time.
I
mean,
what
you
say?

We're
going
to
be
Bet
you
if
we
started
a
game
right
now,
Stop
talking!
You
don't
need
to
make
jokes
about
how
When
nobody
knows
how
long
that's
going
to
be.
You
humor
is
not
funny.
I
don't
appreciate
it
while
I'm
trying
Now
please
shut
up,
and
let
us
eat
in
peace.
Emmett?
Pass
me
a
napkin.
I
know
what
you're
saying.
I
never
could
finish
Monopoly.
That
game
really
does
take
forever,
right?
For
me
though,
it
was
..
hmm,
'Chutes,
and
Ladders'.

Ahmm,
'Sorry',
and
'Trouble'.
And
that
thing
with
the
dice,
and
that
thing
That,

that
..
'PoppleMatic
Bubble!',
You
ever
play
that,
what
was
it,
'Operation'?
-
Loath
'Operation"
That
noise
that
thing
would
make
-
Good
lord,
Can
you
give
me
the
salt?
Please?
Ah,
shoot.

Sorry.
I'm
going
to
need
the
pepper
also,
-
What
exactly
do
you
think
you're
doing?
-
The
hell
you
were?

What
was
that?
You
trying
to
insult
me?
Here
in
a
shelter
that
I
built,
You
don't
think
I
see
what
you
just
did?
Is
that
how
you
thank
me
for
saving
your
life?
-
Calm
down.
Shut
Up!

And
stay
in
your
seat!
Is
it?
Let
me
tell
you,
I
know
what
a
traitor
looks
like,
Understand?
I
have
shown
you
nothing
but
I
want
you
to
apologize.
And
tell
me
you're
going
to
behave.
I
will.
You
will
what?
I'll
behave.
And
I'm
so
sorry.
You
have
to
stay
hydrated,
.
It's
easy
to
forget
down
here.
What's
wrong?
Nothing
Where
are
my
keys?
Michelle!
Stop!
Give
me
those
keys!
-
Come
on.
No!
No!

No!
Don't
do
it!
No!
Don't
open
that
door!
It's
a
car!
It's
a
car!

I
see
a
car!
Here!

Here!
Here!
Michelle,
listen
to
me,
don't
do
it!
Help
me!
-
There's
a
woman.
-
I
just..
I
want
to
come
inside.
Do
not
let
her
in!
Look
at
her
face,
Michelle!
No,
no,
no
..
no,
no.
Please
open,

I
don't
want
to
die.
Please,
help
me,
I
don't
want
to
die.
Just
a
little,
oh
,
please
open
the
door.
-
Open
it.
You
can't
help
her!
-
Nobody
can.

It'
be
okay,
all
of
us.
Open
the
door!
Don't
listen
to
her!
Open
the
door,
you
bitch!
Let
me
in!
Let
me
in!


Let
me
in!


Let
me
in!
Now!
Now.

Now!
Now!
Open!
I
know
it's
hard.
Realizing
they're
all
gone.
The
ones
you
love.
I
have
something
to
confess
to
you.
I
crashed
into
your
car.
Your
accident.
Was
my
fault.
When
I
found
out
about
the
incoming
I
knew
I
needed
to
get
back
here
Oh,
I
was
driving
like
a
maniac,
I
tried
to
pass
you,
and..
I'm
the
reason
you
went
off
the
road.
And
I
know
I
seem
like
a
sensible
guy,
But,
at
the
time,
I
wasn't
myself.
It
was
an
accident.

But
it
was
my
fault.
I
was
afraid
to
tell
you.
I'm
sorry.
You
should
shower,
You
had
the
smallest
amount
of
air
that
These
are
Megan's.
If
you
want
them.
I
recognize
that
woman's
car.
Her
name
was
Leslie,
I
think.
You
knew
her?
She
was
a
neighbor.
Emmett
wasn't
the
only
one
If
any
others
somehow
survived,
As
of
Friday,
kindness
and
generosity
I'm
going
to
need
some
stitches.
Why,
you
want
me
to..?
This
is
your
doing,
isn't
it?
I
mean,
I'll
walk
you
through
it.
Here.
Have
a
drink.
What
is
it?
Technically,
it's
..
Vodka
Safe.

I
distill
it
myself.
-
I
just
said
I
distill
it,
I
didn't
say
anything
You
want
it
on
the
rocks.
Little
trick
I
taught
myself
as
a
young
man
Every
now
and
again,
if
the
CO
was
working
us
the
bathroom
door
while
they
were
still
inside.
I
guess
it
took
an
hour
or
two,
to
get
out
I'm
good.
Suit
yourself.

Cheers.
This
is
clean.
All
you
need
to
do
is
..
stitch.
You're
doing
fine.
Stuff
I
grabbed
from
your
car.
Didn't
have
time
to
bring
in
the
booze.
Sadly.
What
is
all
that?
I
wanted
to
design
clothes.
No
wonder
you
were
so
good
with
the
stiches.
Megan
wanted
to
be
an
artist.
-
She
was
your
daughter?
She
was
smart,
loved
to
read,
She
inhaled
books.
She
liked
their
movies.
We
used
to
have
this
little
joke,
What
do
you
want
to
be
And
you
know
what
she'd
say?
French.
Anyway,
Her
mother
turned
her
against
me.
Took
her
off
to
Chicago.
People
are
strange
creatures
You
can't
always
convince
them
that
You
don't
know
they're
gone.
Anyway,
At
least
I
tried
to
help
them.
Hey,
you
know
there
is
nothing
Even
if
you
had
let
her
in,
You
asked
earlier
about
..
regrets,
Yeah,
I
got
some
of
those.
Welcome
to
the
club.
I
mean,
I
lived
my
life
And
that
was
by
design,
I
was
so
fast
in
high
school,
I
even
managed
to
outrun
my
bad
grades.
I
was
all-state
track,
Three
years
in
a
row.
Caught
a
full
ride
to
Louisiana
Tech
I
remember
I
spent
the
last
Showing
off
the
bus
ticket
they
And
then
came
the
night
And
I
just
got
so
worried,
About
how
bad
I
was
With
all
those
smart
kids
So
I
went
out
of
my
way
To
get
just
pissed
wasted,
so
bad
that
There
was
no
chance
I
was
waking
So
I
missed
the
bus
I
didn't
buy
a
ticket
for
the
next
one
Or
the
one
after
that.
Well,
if
you'd
gone,
Well,
lucky
me,
right?
Lucky
us.
A
few,
a
few
years
ago,
I
was
at
a
hardware
store
And
there
was
this
little
girl,
And
he
was
in
a
hurry,
and
he
kept
yanking
on
her
arm,
too
hard.
You
know
that
feeling?
When
my
Dad
got
that
way,
To
take
the
worst
of
it.

she
ever
show
up,

she
went
missing?
He
said
to
me,
he
said
to
my
face.
He
took
her
and
he
killed
her.
I
was
just
thinking,
Maybe
we
take
away
his
gun
Tie
him
up,
to
confess.
Whatever
it
is
he's
done
Look,
like
I
said,

about
