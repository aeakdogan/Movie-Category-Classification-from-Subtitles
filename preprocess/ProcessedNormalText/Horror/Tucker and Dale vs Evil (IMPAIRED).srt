They're
just
your
average
college
girls.
You
know
something,
Dale?
She's
just
human.
Talk
to
her?
What?
I

Tell

Yup.

worst
that
could
happen?
You
know
something?
-
You're

Tuck.
I'm
gonna
do
it.
-
I'm
gonna
do
it
right
now.
All

It

Smile

They

Come

I

Let

Mm-hm.

That's

Howdy,
Officer.

It's
a
beautiful
day,
isn't
it?
Licence,
please.
Uh,
I
lost
my
wallet
a
couple
weeks
back.
Temporary.
Where
you
two
headed?
We're
headed
to
our
vacation
home
I
sank
every
penny
I
had
into
it.
Me
and
Dale
here,
we're
gonna
go

Do

little
fishin'.
I
figured
a
little
man
time
There
ain't
nothing
up
there
but
pain
and
I
pulled
you
over
cos
Oh,
yes,
sir.
See
that
you,
uh...
get
that
fixed.
That
was
very
helpful.
-
Man,
that
was
tense.
There
he
goes.
Bye!
God,
would
you
look
at
him?
He
was
jealous
because
Ah.
Well...

Here's
to
the
good
life,
huh?
-
Oh,
yeah.

I
mean,
what's
a
parasite?

I
know,
I
know.

Wow.
And
another
one
right
there.
Oh,
my
God.
It's
perfect!
-
And
what
did
they
call
this,
a
fixer-upper?
-
All
right,
let's
go
check
it
out
inside.
-
I
can't
believe
this
is
ours!
Oh,
my
God!

-
N'ell,
it's
just
a
little
dusty
is
all.

Whoever
used
to
live

have

You
know
something?

Dreams

do
come
true.
-
Look
out!
-
Whoa!
Yeah,
that's
a
good
idea.
You
can
get
off
me
now.
If
you
have
a
reoccurring
dream
about

Yes.
-
Guys!
-
What?

No!
-
Absolutely
not.

You're
such
a
liar.
Now,
do
you
fuckers
This
story
happened
right
here,
It
was
20
years
ago
today.
The
Memorial
Day
Massacre.
How
a
bunch
of
college
kids...
they
came
out
here
to
have
a
good
time...
but
little
did
they
know
that
they
weren't

J'
Pump
it
up
J'
And
the
jam
is

J'
Pump

party
going
on

dance
Hoof
-
J'
See,
cos
that's
where
the...

Get
another
one!
Come
on!

J'
I
ain't
afraid
to
die
-
Hey,
what
the
hell
are
you
doing?
No,
no.


Only
one
person
lived
to
tell
this
story.
The
rest
of
them
just
disappeared...
and
their
bodies
are
buried
beneath
us.
Hey!
Hey!
There's
a
lake
back
there.
Who
wants
to
go
skinny
dipping?
-
I
do.

-
All
right.



Uh...
That's
OK,
Tuck.
You
take
that.
That's
yours.
That's
why
you're
never
gonna
It's
cos
you
don't
stick
up
for
yourself.
Do
not
even
think
about
it.
-
But
you
just
said...
-
OW!
What'd
I
just
say?
-
You
said
I
gotta
stick
up
for
myself.
That
was
the
last
thing
I
said.

Hello?
Is
someone
there?
Guys?

Yargh!
God,
Chad!
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
-
You
are
such
an
asshole.
No,
it
wasn't.
You
got
nothing
to
worry
about,
Allie.
You
totally
freaked
me
out.
You
know,
you
can
drop
the
act
now.
-
What
act?
-
I
don't
think...
But
that's
OK,
Allie,
because
I
get
it.
I
mean,
you
are
better
than
everyone
else.
You
and
I,
Allie...
are
cut
from
a
different
cloth.
-
I'm
not...
I...
I'm
glad
that
we
have
this
chance
Chad,
you're
drunk.
That's
a
good
thing.
It
lowers
my
inhibitions.
OK,
uh...
-
Come
on,
stop.
Why?
Why
stop?
We're
perfect
for
each
other.
Let's
talk
about
this
later.
Come
on,
Allie.
Come
on...


Oh,
it's
so
cold!

What's
that
all
about?

I
don't
know,
No.
No,
Tuck,
you
know
what?
My
guess
would
be
that
they
-
Yeah,
I
kind
of
want
to
see
them.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
-
Damn
it,
Dale!
I'm
not
gonna
go
around
-
OK.


Look.
Oh.
-
Tucker!


God
damn
it,
Dale!
Me?
What
did
I
do?
When
you
see
a
college
girl
prancing
-
you
do
not
yell
out
my
name.
You
are
hopeless,

She
didn't
come
up
yet.
-
Tuck,
paddle.

Hey!
Lady?

Hey,
lady!
-
Where'd
she
go,
Tuck?


Get
her
legs!
Oh!
No!
-
Hey,
we
got
your
friend!
-
They
got
Allison!
Come
on!

Hey!
We
got
your
friend!
Why
the
hell
Doesn't
matter,
Tucker,
we
gotta
get
her
-
Shit!
-

Chad!
Chad!

The
hillbillies...
-
What
hillbillies?

They
captured
Allison!
Allie!






Oh,
God!
No.
-

No,
please!
No,
please,
don't...
Please
don't
cut
me
open!
Oh!
It's
the
pancakes!
You
hate
pancakes!
-

Should
have
asked
her
if
she
liked
Pa...
Pancakes?
Allison!
I
don't
understand.
-
Maybe
they
took
her
to
the
hospital.
Chuck,
tell
him
what
you
saw.
Well,
it
was
really
dark,
Like...eating
her
face
off.
That
is
so
disgusting.
Not
to
sound
too
cliche,
And
just
leave
Allison
with
them?
If
they
already
ate
her,
We
don't
need
the
police.
Vvhat
if
I
go?
It's
my
dad's
truck.
He
told
me
Fine.
You
wanna
go,
Chuck?
Then
just
go.
OK,
awesome.
I'll
be
back
in
a
jiffy,
I
swear.
That's
such
bullshit.
Hey,
guys!
What
is
this
place?
It's
just
a
cabin.
Oh,
yeah?
Then
why
don't
you
All
right.
Maybe
I
will.
I
said
maybe.
There
you
go.
Please
don't
tell
me
Wha-What
am
I
doing
here?
Oh,
you
don't
remember?
We||,
me
and
Tucker...
I
mean,
uh,
I
and
Tuck...
We||...
-
Tucker
and
I
brung
you
here
last
night.
Because
you
were
about
and
you
climbed
up
on
a
bunch
of
rocks,
and
then
you
fell
into
the
water,
I
dove
in
and
rescued
you.
-
Wait,
you...you
were
spying
on
us?
No,
we
weren't
spying.
We
were
out
there
fishin'.
OK?
I
didn't
see...
Where
are
my
friends?
-
They
ran
off
into
the
woods.
Yeah,
but
don't
be
mad
at
them.
Some
people
just
aren't
any
good
in
a
crisis,
and
that's
why
Tucker
and
I
brung
you
here,
hoping
that
they
would
I
didn't
have
any
girlie
clothes,
so...
It's
OK,
I...
I
never
really
had
much
fashion
sense,
-
Me
neither.
-

That's
my
dog,
Jangers.
He
looks
mean,
You
can
just
pet
him
round
the
nose.
-
He's
drooling.
Anymfay,
um...I'm
sorry
Tucker
just
bought
this
place,
Yeah,
I'm
sure
it
doesn't
look
like
much
but
we've
always
just
had
sort
of
But,
uh...anyv\/ay...
you
should
relax
and
rest,
OK?
Hey,
what's...
Uh...
It's
Tale.
Ducker.
-
My
name
is
Dale.
But
my...
Well,
it's
a
real
pleasure
to
meet
you,
And
if
you
need
anything
else,
I'll
be
right
in
the
little
room
here.
-
Uh,
Dale?
Do
you
guys
have
Do
you
like
board
games?
What
kind
do
you
have?
We
got
this
one
right
here.
-
Yes!
No
way,
dude.
You
lost.
Just
shut
up
and
walk,
bitch.

Goddamn
Romeo.

Oh,
well.



Oh,
Jesus.

Aargh!
Aargh!
Argh!
Run!
Run
for
your
lives!
Yargh!


-






Here
we
go.
Big
roll.
Five.

One,
two,
three,
four,
five.
OK,
shoot.
Who
was
the
fifth
President
Oh,
that's
too
easy.
That's
James
Monroe.
God,
you
are
right
again.
You
are
killing
me.
I
know.
I'm
sorry
about
that.
I
just...
I
got
this
weird
brain
-
but
I
remember
everything
I
ever
heard.
No,
trust
me,
I'm
stupid.
Oh,
that
doesn't
mean
anything.
There's
a
difference
Yeah?

So,
um,
what
is
it
that
you
study
in
college?
I'm
getting
my
Bachelor's
Oh,
a
Bach...
Oh.
So,
what
kind
of
work
Oh,
I
don't
know.
I,
um...
I-I
have
these
stupid
dreams.
Dreams
are
not
stupid.
\N'ell,
um...I
just
think
that
so
many
of
the
are
caused
by
a
lack
of
communication,
-
Yeah.
I
just
always
thought
that
No,
don't!
Don't!
Yeah,
my
parents
say
the
same
thing.
No.
I
think
you
could
do
whatever
you
want.
Yeah,
you
could
have
just
Hey,
hey.
Oh,
my
God,
Tucker,
I
sawed
into
a
bees'
nest.

Why?
I
didn't
do
it
on
purpose,
you
idiot.
I
might
have
avoided
it
Yeah.

not
sit
around
playing
stupid
board
games!
It
was
my
fault,
I...
No,
that's
not
true.
It
was
my
fault.
How
about
I
come
over
there
Then
I'll
help
you
with
whatever
you
want?
-
All
right,
I'd
like
that.
Thank
you.
Let
me
help.
-
Be
careful.
Be
careful.
Hi.
I
saw
your
friend
out
there.
He
must
be
allergic
to
bees
or
something,
-
I
should
go
out
there
and
find
them...
No,
you
need
to
rest,
-
But
I
can
just...
We'll
go
find
your
friends.
You
should
relax.
Ain't
that
right,
Tucker?
-

Yeah.
-

Yeah,
yeah.
Dale,
just...
My
friends
can
be
kind
of
judgmental.
I'm
gonna
let
Tucker
He
can
win
over
just
about
anybody,
OK,
here
we
go.

-
They
fucking
killed
him,
man.
-
Yeah,
"Stay
the
fuck
out
of
our
woods."
Would
you
fucking
quit
it
with
this
thing?
We
gotta
get
to
the
road
We
don't
need
a
ride
out
of
here.
This
is
what
it's
all
about.
Survival
of
the
fittest!
-

That's
my
whole
face.
You
have
serious
issues,
you
know
that?
-
Quick.
Somebody's
coming.

And
the
answer
was,

Is
it
a
triangle?
Tucker,
you
would
have
been
proud
of
me.
A
smart
little
college
girl
like
that,
-

Dale.
You
beat
the
crap
outta
everybody.
I
know.
You
keep
telling
me
that.
Tell
you
what,
when
we
get
back
I'll
finish

They're
gonna
kill
her!
-
Somebody
was
just
here.
College
kids!
-

College
kids!
-

College
kids!
-


I
don't
see
'em.

They
must
have
run
off.
Well,
hmm...
Maybe
we
could
leave
All
right.
With
what?
-
N'ell,
this'll
work.
-
My
face
is
as
hot
as
a
haemorrhoid.
-
Careful.


J'
Uh-huh,
I
got
my
cootie
shot
J'
You
think
that
girl
is
hot...
-
Dale?
-
Did
you
guys
find
my
friends?
Whoa.
-
What?
Your
friends?
No,
no.
They
should
be
by
here
any
minute.
-
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
digging
a
crap...
crapper
hole.
It's
a
hole.
-
Outhouse
hole.
-
Right.
You
mind
if
I
help?
No,
no,
it's
not
work
for
a
pretty...
Oh.
I
grew
up
on
a
farm.
That's
a
good
rule.
Yeah.
So
I've
done
this
before,
Yeah.
You
gonna
help,
-
Uh...
No,
I'm
gonna
help.
I'll
just...
Yeah,
yeah.
-
Yeah,
you're
doing
a
good
job.

That
sick
fuck.
We
don't
have
much
time.

Does
everybody
have
their
weapons?
All
right,

guys
go
around,

guy
I'm

Huh?
Oh,

OK?

Allison,
say
something!
-

Tucker!
Tucker!
You'll
never
beli...
What
happened
to
you?
-
Are
you
OK?
Some
kid,
he
just
hucked
himself
-
What?
From
his
shoes
and
pants,
it
looked
like
What
the
hell
happened
to
her?
She
got
knocked
out
and
fell
Is
that
your
blood?
No,
it's
college
kid
blood.
One
of
them
speared
himself
through
the
gut
-
Holy
crap.
Calm
down.
Don't
cry.
-
Calm
down!
-
Get
a
hold
of
yourself!
All
right...
-
What?
-
It's
a
what?

and
killing
themselves
all
over
the
woods.
Holy
shit.
We
have
got
to
hide
You
know
what
else?
Yeah.
Think
about
it.
That's
why
they
acted
so
funny
after
-
Why?
It's
good
that
you
and
I
don't
know
-
Yeah,
that's
a
good
point.
OK,
so
what...
what
do
we...
We
go
to
the
police?
-
Call
the
police?
-
And
tell
'em
what?

That's
a
good
idea,
Dale.
"Oh,
hidey-ho,
Officer.
"There
we
were,
minding
our
own
business,
"when
kids
started
killing
themselves
Well,
that's
what
happened,
Tucker!
You
would
have
to
be
a
moron
It
doesn't
matter
what
happened.
What
And
what
looks
like
what
happened...

So
what
the
hell
do
we
do?
We
gotta
clean
this
mess
up.
-
Right
now.
-

It's
not
good
for
you.
Fucking
dying
isn't
good
for
you,
either,
but
that
doesn't
We
gotta
get
out
of
here.
I
mean,
How
are
we
gonna
get
outta
here?
Dickwad
over
here
sent
Chuck
off
\N'ell,
then
let's
walk.
-
40
miles?
-
before
you
wore
your
stripper
shoes.
Listen,
we
gotta
work
together,
OK?
We
never
shou|d've
come
out
here.
Chad!
You
guys
are
all
a
bunch
of
fucking
pussies,
I
mean,
a
few
little
tiny
murders...
and
everyone
just
freaks
out.
But
do
you
know
how
lucky
you
all
are,
huh?
-
Huh?
How
many
people
do
you
think
-
The
chance
to
die?
To
be
free
from
people
always
There's
no
rules
out
here.
And
if
you
don't
think
maybe
you
deserve
to
die.

That's
fucked
up.
-

Chuck
got
the
police!
No,
you
don't
need
the
fucking
cops!
The
cops
aren't
gonna
help
us,
man.
Don't
you
fucking
idiots
know
anything?
Fuck.
Now,
don't
you
worry.
Probably
just
a
little
misunderstanding,
-
Oh,
God!
Look
out!
-
Help
us!
Help
us!
They're
dead!
They
died!

Slow
down,
now.
-
They
killed
them!
Stay
calm.
\N'ell,
why
don't
you
kids
climb
in
Those
stupid
fucks.

I
don't
think
I
know.
-
The
store
better
not
charge
me
for
this!
All
right,
look,
I'm
gonna
wedge
it
from
-
OK.
-

Argh!
-
Oh,
Tuck!
Oh,
take
it
off!
Take
it
off
me!
Get
it
off
me.
Not
on
the
face!
Oh!
I'm
gonna
barf.
-

-
Here,
grab
a
leg.
Grab
a
leg.
Get
him
over
to
the
truck.
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.
-
He's
heavy
for
half
a
guy.

Oh,
shit.
-
Let
me
do
the
talking.
You
kids
stay
put.
I'll
handle
this.

Hey.
-
Good
to
see
you
again.
-
We
have
had
a
doozy
of
a
day.
-
Uh,
there
we
were...
-
minding
our
own
business...
-
making
improvements
to
my
house...
..when,
all
of
a
sudden,
these
kids
started
killing
themselves
This
one
right
here,
he
dove
headfirst
the
woody
right
back
there.
There's
another
one
up
over
there

Straight
through.
I
don't
know
how
much
experience
-
but
we
were
scared
shitless.
You
must
think
that
I'm
some
-
No...
-
No,
sir.
Let
me
get
this
straight,
cos
I'm
having
-
What?
when
this...kid...ran
up
-
That's
a
fact.
And
I
think
maybe
they
might
be
-
What
girl?
She
can
maybe
explain
if
I
hadn't
have
knocked
her
-

That's...
On
accident.
You've
got
another
one
inside,
-
Yeah,
she's
in
my
bedroom.

You
better
show
me
what
you
done
with
her.
-
Right
this
way.
Let's
show
him.

Great
idea.
Wait,
where
is
he
going?
-
No,
don't
go
in
there.
-

Why
doesn't
he
fucking
arrest
them?
Her
eyes
are
equal,
reactive
to
light.
-
At
least
she's
not
braindead.
I
told
you
boys
to
stay
away
from
this
place,
Now,
you're
looking
at
least
two
counts
but
you'd
be
lucky
to
get
that.
Officer,
do
we
look
like
We||,
it's...
Looks
can
be
deceiving.
-

Oh,
don't!

Sheriff!
You
OK?

-
Oh,
shit!

Come
on!
-
How's
he
even
walking,
Tuck?

He's
gonna
be
fine.
-


Don't
worry,
I
got
it.
-

Oh,
my
God!
They
fucking
killed
him!
-
Unlock
the
door!
God
damn
it,
Tucker!
You
are
not
putting
this
on
me!
In
there
playing
board
games
-

Unlock
the
fucking
door!

If
you
hadn't
been
playing
we
would
have
had
Heads
up.
-
Fuck
you,
you
motherfuckers!
Oh,
you
got
to
take
Don't
do...
-

You've
got
to
start
being
more
careful!


I
don't
think
he
understands!

om
"You
gotta
take
the
safety
off"?
You're
something,
Dale.
None
of
this
-
What?
For
being
such
a
goddamn
Good
Samaritan!
-
"Oh,
let's
save
her."
Hell!
-
Oh,
halle-fuckin'-Iujah!
I'm
not
blaming
this
on
her,
We||,
you
know
what,
Tucker?
None
of
this
would
have
happened
-
That
isn't
even
an
option.
You
don't
like...
-
What
do
you
mean,
you
don't
like
fishin'?
I
like...
I
like
it
OK.
You
know...
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry,
Tucker.
-
Yeah,
you
kinda
did.
-
Cut
it
out!

Tucker...
where's
Jangers?
-
Shit.
Aah!
Damn.

Nuts...
-
Hey,
hillbilly!
Your
move.
Oh,
son
of
a
bitch!
-
They
got
my
dog.

We
gotta
do
something.
-
Did
you
bring
that
nail
gun
in
here?
Stay
low.
Stay
low
to
the
ground.

Oh.

All
right.
-
Cover
me.
I
ain't
never
shot
at
nobody
before.
If
it
helps,
-

-

Whoa!
Now,
you
create
a
distraction.
I'm
gonna
go
out
the
back
door.
-
And,
Dale...
Try
not
to
shoot
me.
-
OK,
I'll
try.
-
What
the
fuck
is
taking
so
long?
Hey,
college
kids!
You
want
some
of
this?

Ha-ha!
You
like
that,
college
kids?
I
got
plenty
more
where
that
came
from!
-


Jesus,
Dale.

Hey,
hillbilly!
You
shoot
at
us
again,
and
your
dog's
dead!
If
you
kill
my
dog,
Then
bring
out
the
girl!
-

I'm
gonna
shoot
your
dog!

I'm
gonna
get
really
mad!

I'll
get
really
mad!

Go
home.
Go!


Oh!
It
is
a
beautiful
day
for
a
run,
isn't
it?




Oh,
God.
Please,
no.


Are
we
done
yet?

I
don't
know,
Naomi,
is
it
covered?
All
right...trap's
set.

-
Hey...he's
awake.

What
is
the
matter
with
us?
-
Hold
him
steady.
Wait.
Stop...
I've
never
stood
so
close
to
pure
evil
before.

-
It
kind
of
stinks.
OK!
Don't...
No,
look,
I
know
you
kids
are
having
fun,
It's
payback
time,
hillbilly.
Payback...
All
right,
look.
I
can
get
my
cooler.
Hey,
I
got
10
to
12
beers
in
there.
They're
yours.
-

This
is
for
|\/like!
-


OW!
You
prick.

-
Dale?
How
are
you
feelin'?
-
A
little
fuzzy.
Wha...
What
happ...
-
What
happened?
Well,
uh...

I
can't...
Um...
It
was
so
awful.

Oh,
my
God.
-
I
can't
cry
in
front
of
a
girl,
God
damn
it.
It's
good
to
cry
sometimes.
It's
OK,
just...
Just
let
it
out.
It's
OK,
all
right?

There
you
go.
It'll
feel
better.
Come
on,
just
take
a
deep
breath.

There
we
go.
Now...

Now
tell
me
what
happened.
Well...it's
hard
to
say.
Um...
Your
friends...
Do
some
of
your
friends
take
medication?
-
Why?
What
are
you
talking
about?
They're
out
there
somewhere
right
now
-
I
don't
understand
what
you're
talking...
It
doesn't
make
any
sense.
It's
like
all
your
friends
just
The
last
thing
I
remember,
I
saw...
and
then
Todd
was
running
at
us,
and...
-
Oh,
my
God.
At
first
I
thought
they
were
trying
to
kill
you,
and
then
they
started
killing
themselves
and
now
they're
going
after
my
dog...

..Jangers.

I
guess
they
just
like
killing.
No,
there
must
be
some
kind
of
mistake.
-

They're
not
gonna
stop
till
they
kill
all
of
us,
Dale,
it's
OK.
Nobody
wants
to
hurt
you.
-

Die,
hillbilly!
I'm
gonna
go
talk
to
them,
OK?
-
What?
No,
no.
We'll
clear
it
right
up,
OK?
Allison,
don't
go
out
there!
Oh,
my
God.
-


-
Ugh!

Oh!
Did
you
see
them?
-
No.
That's
from
Tucker's
shirt.

What
is
that?

Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!

There's
a
note
right
there.
"Now
we
got
your
friend.
Try
and
get
him!"
Dale,
how...
A
few
hours.
I
don't
understand
what...
I
gotta
go
help
Tucker.
God
damn
it.
My
best
friend
needs
me.
-
Wait.
We
don't
want
to
escalate
things.
No.
They
must
have
thought
Oh,
and
why
would
they
think
that?

I...
I
don't
know.
I
think
you
do
know.
We||,
when
we
first
saw
you
guys
we
just
thought
that
you
looked...
a
little
creepy.
I
was
nervous.
Dale,
I
know
that
now,
but
we
didn't
then.
You
thought
I
looked
We
misjudged
you,
Dale.
I...
I'm
really
sorry.
Don't
be
sorry.
It's
my
fault.

I
should
have
known
that
if
somebody'd
end
up
dead.
Dale,
it's...
Dale,
it's
not
like
that.
If
you
do
see
your
friends...
tell
'em
that
I
never
wanted
to
hurt
anybody.
Dale,
Dale,
stop.
Wait.
No...
Don't
go
there.
Oh,
shit.
Tucker!
-
Tucker,
you
cut
there?
Tuck!

Oh,
goddamn
stupid
college
kids.
Tucker!
-

Dale!
Tucker?!
Yeah.
Tuck!
Tucker!
-

Dale...
-
Tucker.
-
It's
a
what?
What?

Oh,
no.
Oh,
no!
Tuck,
no!
I
don't
wanna
die!
Please!

Oh,
God!
Tucker!
Dale...

Oh.
Oh...
Oh...
I
never
thought
I'd
say
this,
but
I'm
glad
I'm
not
hung
like
a
bear.
-

Whoa...
-Oh...
that
kid,
he's
got
some
serious
issues.
I
know.
Let's
get
you
down
from
there.
-
Wait!
Sorry
about
that.

This
vacation
sucks.

Come
on,
let's
go.


Look
at
this
place.
-
This
is
where
evil
lives.

Allison!
-
Allison!
-
Chad?
What
are
you
guys
doing?
Saving
you,
stupid!
Why
are
you
whispering?

oh.
This
place
is
really
freaky.
What
have
they
done
to
you,
Allie?
They
haven't
done
anything
to
me.
Chad,
this
has
all
been
We
have
to
burn
this
place
to
the
ground.
What?
No,
no.
Chad...
Chad!
Stop.
No,
Chad,
no.
Chad,
stop!
You
can't
do
this.
You
guys
have
to
listen
to
me,
OK?
Tucker
and
Dale
did
not
mean
You
have
no
idea...
what
this
is
all
about,
do
you,
Allison?
-
Huh?
These
freaks
are
evil...
and
they
deserve
everything
OK,
just
relax,
all
right?
I'm
just
trying
to
explain
Tucker
and
Dale
have
been
nothing
-
while
you
guys
have
been
terrorising
them.
By
doing
what?
Saving
my
life?
Wait
a
minute.
I
remember
reading
It's
called
Stockholm
syndrome.
When
someone
who's
been
kidnapped
You're
falling
in
love
with
him?
No.
W-What?
-
Chad,
the...
The
what?
This
is...
you're
not
falling
in
love
How
could
you
love
him?
Chad,
please.
You
don't
understand.
Well,
are
you
or
are
you
not
-
What
is
the
matter
with
you?
Hey!
Let
the
girl
go.

Tcha!
-
Are
you
OK,
Allie?
Wait.
Everyone
just
stop
for
a
second
Nobody
wants
to
hurt
anyone.

You
could
have
fooled
me.
-
Fuck
off,
hillbilly.
Wait!
How
about
I
make
some
tea,
and
we
all
sit
and
talk
this
out?
Oh,
yeah,
that
sounds
like
a
good
idea.
I'm
gonna
go
get
a
beer.
OK,
Chad,
you...sit
here,
OK?
In
this
chair.

Dale,
you...
you
sit
in
this
one.
OK,
good.
Now,
um...
I'm
gonna
get
the
tea.
Is
that
camomile
tea?
I
can't
have
that.

it's
Earl
Grey.
Oh,
I
love
Earl
Grey.
That's
great.
Here's
what
we're
gonna
do.
and
as
you're
listening
to
the
other
person,
OK?
OK.
Now,
it's
important
and
understand
each
other's
perspective
OK.
Chad,
why
don't
you
start?
-
Well,
where
should
I
fucking
begin?
A
long
time
ago,
-
before
I
was
born...
This
is
important.
You
see,
my
parents,
they
were
attacked
It
was
20
years
ago.
The
Memorial
Day
Massacre.
They
brutally
murdered
everyone.
-

But
they
captured
hen
My
father
was
helpless...
and
he
didn't
even
know
And
they
forced
him
to
watch...
while
they
tortured
hen

But
my
mom,
she
fought
back...

-
..and
she
escaped.
But
my
father
wasn't
so
lucky.
His
body
was
never
found.
By
the
time
I
was
born...
my
mother
was
already
institutionalised.
I
grew
up
hearing
that
story
OK.
Um...
Thank
you
for
sharing
with
us,
Chad.


-

No,
I'm
not
going
in
there!
Now,
Chad
said
if
they
were
we
come
in,
guns
blazing.
-
But
you
don't
even
have
a
gun.
Are
they
drinking
tea?
Oh!
No!
No
way.
They're
fucking
trapped.
Oh...yeah.
Now,
come
on,
we
gotta
do
something.
It's
your
turn.

OK,
well...
First
of
all...
I
am
really
sorry
That
is
awful.
Secondly...
I
mean,
I
would
have
been
six
years
old
It
may
not
have
been
you,
My
kind?
Now,
hey,
I
can't
even
hurt
a
fish,
That's
right.

I
just
can't
do
it!
OK.
S-So
now
that
you've
both
how
do
you
feel?
I
feel
better.
I
feel...
I
feel
like
a
weight...
Yeah,
I
feel
good.
Great.
OK.

It's
show
time,
freaks!

-

Jason!
No!
Jesus
Christ!
Oh,
shit,
baby!
Why
didn't
you
duck?
Chad,
st...

-
Get
him,
Tucker!
Dale!
Go
back
to
hell
where
you
belong,
freak!
-
Oh,
shit!
-

-
Be
calm.
It's
just
the
leg.
-
I'm
on
fire!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Stop,
drop,
and
roll!
-
Get
away
from
him!

He's
crackling
like
a
log!
Oh,
that
stinks.
-
Oh,
shit!


Allie,
run!
Come
on,
let's
go!
-

Get
off
of
me,
you
nasty
bitch!

-

My
cabin.
Your
cabin.
I'm
a
terrible
therapist.
What?
No,
that's
not
true.
I
thought
you
did
a
great
job
in
there.
-
Really?

I
think
we
were
Thanks,
Dale.
That's
really
sweet.
-
Uh,
guys?
-

I
think
we
should
go
Wait.
Maybe
we
should
help
him.

-
Argh!

Get
to
the
truck!

Tucker!
Tucker!


He's
coming!
-
OK,
come
on,
truck.
Come
on,
truck.
-
Do
not
flood
it.
-
Guys,
just
go!
This
is
the
only
thing
I
got
left.

Go.

Oh!
-

Dale,
look
out!
Jangers,
not
now,
boy.

Jangers,
hey!
Whoa.
Jangers!
Allie.
Allison!
Jangers...
Allison!
She's
gone.

What
the
hell...
Tucker?

Tucker,
what
happened?
-
He
took
her.
I
tried
to
stop
him.
-

I
tell
you
something,
Dale.
It's
gonna
be
a
long
time
Oh,
shit.
Tucker,
this
is
all
my
fault.
-
Look
at
you.
I
never
should
have
talked
to
Allison.
People
like
me
and
people
like
her
-
That's
not
true.
I
never
should
have
even
Listen
to
me.


Do
you
remember
when
we
was
kids...
and
we
used
to
go
catch
frogs
Yeah.
Yeah,
I
guess
I
do.
Remember
how
we
used
to
compete
Yeah,
but
I
don't
think

any
more
negativity.

You're
smart...

you're
strong...
and
you're
not
as
ugly
as
you
think
you
are.
Thank
you,
Tucker.
-

Life
is
short.
You
gotta
go
after
what
you
want.
She
needs
you
now
more
than
ever,
especially
cos
she's
always
falling
down

But
I
don't
even
know
where

took
her.

your
mouth.

less.
OK,

What
is
the
matter
with
you?

What
is
the
matter
with
me?
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
No.
You've
gone
hillbilly
on
me,
Allison.
Now,
I'm
willing
to
forgive
you...
but
you're
gonna
have
to
beg.
Chad...

That
was
just
not

very
nice
apology

hillbilly?
Allie!
Allie!
Hey,
it's
just
me.
Hey...

It's
OK.

Yeah.
What?
Oh,

thought
it
might
look

Yeah.
Dale,

Hang

I'm
comin'.
Hang
on.
-
OK,
what
do
we
got
here?
It's
no
big
deal.


How
sweet.
The
dim-witted
hillbilly
What
kind
of
knot
is
this?
You
think
you're
gonna
win,
It’s
time
to
say
goodbye
to
the
girl.
You
shouldn't
have
betrayed
me,
Allison.

No.
Oh,
jeez.
No,
no!
-
Oh,
Dale!
Dale!

OK,
OK.
Hold
on!
OK,
rabbit
comes
out
the
tree,

is
really
too
bad.
Are
you
OK,
huh?

Dale!

Dale!
Dale!
It's
time
for
you
to
feel
my
pain.
Bring

frat
bitch.

here!
Come

Come

Here!
Come

Go!
Go,

boxes
on
there.

Are

OK.

Yeah.
What
we
need
to
find
something
preferably
big
and
sharp
Nah!
Shit...
Oh,
hey!
This
might
work,
huh?
Or
not.
Oh,
my
God.
Dale?
-
What?

Look.
-
What?
-
Hey,
ain't
that
that
dead
Sheriff
right
there?
-
Look
at
the
guy
in
the
middle.
He
looks
just
like
that
-
Yeah.
And
it
says
here,
"The
single
survivor
"The
survivor
is
reported
"She's
now
undergoing
Think
about
it.
He
said
his
mother
His
father's
body
was
never
found.

I
think
we've
just
found
him.

Holy
S-H-I-T.
-

Chad!
-
Time
to
die,
freak!
Just
wait!
Wait,
wait!
Wait,
Chad!
Wait!
-
You're
a
hillbilly,
too!
-
No!
Look!
That's
your
real
father.
No.
No!
It's
true,
Chad.
You're
half
hillbilly.
It
can't
be.
They
lied
to
me!
How
could
they?
Maybe
they
didn't
want
you
There
is
no
truth!

Everything
is
a
lie!
-
What
did
you
do?
-
What?
that
causes
an
anaphylactic
reaction
Like
I
said,
I
remember
weird
stuff.
But
he'll
be
OK,

Or
not.



OK,
here
we
go.
-
Uh,
yeah,
wait.
My
teeth.
Do
I
got
any...
-
Clear?
OK,
just
give
me
a
second.

The
chaos
and
confusion
is
still
being
unravelled.
What
appears
to
be
a
tragic
mass
suicide
involving
a
group
of
may
in
fact
be
the
work
of
a
lone
deranged
-
The
killings
happened
on
the
....
-
Hey,
buddy.
How
you
feeling?
high
on
prescription
medication.
-
Yeah,
looks
like
it.
They
found
my
fingers.
Check
it
out.
-
Yeah.
I
don't
remember
that
one
looking
that
way.
Does
that
look
funny
to
you?
No.
No,
not
really.
That
looks
natural.
It's
good.
By
the
way,
I
brought
you
something.
-
Shut
your
eyes,
OK?
OK,
open
them.
Oh...
-
Oh,
buddy.
That...
-
It's
cold,
too,
should
be.
Look
what
else
I
got
you.
A
bendy
straw,
-
-
There
you
go.
Mmm.
Mm!
Don't
choke.
I'm
gonna
let
you
rest.
Drink
the
whole
thing.
-
Dale?
Did
you
ask
her?
-
Ask
her
what?
Oh.We||...

I
was
gonna,
but
then
Dale!

You
are
hopeless,
Yeah.
You're
probably
right
about
that.
Except
for...
she
kinda
mentioned
to
me
we're
goin'
bowling.
-
You
little
dickhead.

OW.
Whoo!
Yes.
-
Dale
Dobson,
you
are
one
lucky
man.
That
girl
has
got
an
amazing
set...
I
know.
Life
is
short,
BJ.
because
it
sure
as
heck
fire
-
You
know
somethin'?
You're
right.
-
I'm
gonna
go
talk
to
her.
Don't
be
nervous,
and
just
be
yourself,
OK?
Yeah.
You
got
'er.
Go,
buddy.
Hey.
-
I'm
pretty
good
at
this,
aren't
I?
Listen,
Allie,
I
hope
you
don't
think
but
I
got
you
a
little
something.
Dale,
that's
so
sweet.
I
know.
I
wanted
to.

Oh,
my
gosh.
-
You
know
what
that
is?
It's
a
pink
helmet.
I
think,
you
know,
it
might
just
be
better
if
-
OK,
thank
you.
It's
perfect.
So,
listen,
Dale,
I'm,
uh...
I'm
really
sorry
about
What
do
you
mean?
I
mean,
except
for
all
the
people
dying,
when
That
wasn't
so
much
fun,
I
enjoyed
every
minute
-
Dale...
cos
I
don't
know
if
we're
ever
gonna
get
and
I
want
to
let
you
know
that
I...
I
feel
the
same
way.
-
Really?

-

Oh,
my
God,
should
we
go
help
her?
Hell,
no.
Whatever.
