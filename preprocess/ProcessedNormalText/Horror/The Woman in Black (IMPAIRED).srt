MRS.
FISHER:
My
babies!

Arthur?

JOSEPH:
Daddy?
Coming.


Do
you
like
it,
Daddy?
Very
much.
You
didn't
look
at
it
properly.
Of
course
I
did.
That's
me,
that's
Nanny,
that's
Mummy,
and
that's
you.
Why
do
I
look
so
sad?
That's
what
your
face
looks
like.
ARTHUR:
Oh,
it
is,
is
it?
I
wish
you
didn't
have
Me,
too.
But
we'll
have
the
whole
weekend
in
the
countryside,
won't
we?
See,
tomorrow,
then
Thursday,
and
then
we're
back
together.
You
look
just
like
your
mother.
Have
you
got
the
train
tickets?
Yes,
we've
got
the
train
tickets.
And
you
know
all
the
times?
Okay,
I've
got
to
go.
Don't
Go,
we'll
be
fine.
We'll
See
you.
Wave
bye-bye.
I
know
you've
had
it
rough,
Kipps,
and
I'm
sympathetic
to
your
situation.
But
we
can't
carry
passengers.
We're
a
law
firm,
not
a
charity.
Good.
I
take
it
Tomes
has
briefed
you
on

Alice

month.
Years

I
went
there,
of
course.
The
old
widow

greatly
No
children?
A
boy.
Died
young.
Many
years
ago.
I'll
let
you
have
the
details
to
read
on
your
journey.
But,
principally,
you're
Mrs.
Drablow's
documents.
Make
sure
we've
got
her
final
will.
There's
a
mountain
of
paperwork
It
all
needs
to
be
gone
Very
good.
We've
been
dealing
with
But
he's
not
really
been
cooperating.
What
I'm
hoping,
Kipps,
is
that
you'll
seize
this
chance
to
prove
your
dedication
to
pursuing
a
future
with
this
firm.
This
is
your
final
warning.


GIRL:
Mummy?
Mummy.
My
darling.


DOCTOR:
Mr.
Kipps.
It's
a
boy.

I'm
very
sorry,
Mr.
Kipps.

Have
we
passed
Crythin
Gifford
yet?
Next
stop.
So,
you're
up
from
London?
I
am.
Trying
to
sell
Eel
Marsh
House?
You
won't
find
a
local
buyer.
Are
you
staying
at
The
Gifford
Arms?
Yes.
It's
a
bit
of
a
walk
from
the
station.
I
can
give
you
a
lift.
It's
on
my
way
home.
Thank
you.

Well,

you.
Very
good
to
talk
to
you,
Mr.
Daily.
Mr.
Kipps?
Would
you
like
to
have
supper
with
my
wife
and
me
tomorrow
evening?
You
know,
we
don't
get

Besides,
the

eat
it.
That'd
be
lovely.
Thank
you.

ARTHUR:
Good
evening.
I've
a
room
booked
until
No,
I'm
not

any

My
office

Good
evening.
I

just
telling
Mr.
Kipps
Well,
we

Not

We
must
have
something,
We
don't.
Unless

It's
this
way.

Actually,
I
was
hoping

nanny

Oh,
I

It's

How
old
is
your
son?
He's

Lovely

Thank
you.
Goodnight.

Hello?
Mrs.
Jerome?
Mr.
Kipps?
Yes.
My
husband
went

you

This

I

it
clear
to

Do
you

It's
a
pleasure

Mr.

a
change

I'm

Can
you
pick
me
up
at

I
can't.
I
need
to
get
back
to
the
mainland
before
the
tide
comes
in,
else
I'll
be
stuck
here
for
the
day.
It

then.








Come
on,
then.

Hello?





Who's
there?


MAN:

Keckwick!


Mummy!

the
little
Drablow
boy
was
drowned
in
the
marshes.
Eel
Marsh
House,
it's
empty.
It's
not,
though.
I
saw
a
woman
there.
Excuse
me
one
moment,
sir.

Sir,
my
sister
needs
help.
What's
the
matter?
What's
Her
name
is
Victoria
Hardy.
What
happened,
Victoria?
Did
something
bad
happen?
Our
mum
was
out.
Lye.
Oh,
God.
Constable!
Is
she
going
to
die?
Constable!
It's
going
to
be
all
right.
Darling,
just
let
me
look
at
you...
Constable!


MRS.
HARDY:
No!

No,
my
baby!



Hello?
Mrs.
Fisher?


It's
getting
late.
You'll
miss
your
London
train.
I
can't
leave
yet.
Please
don't
go
back
Why?
Mr.
Kipps,
you
said
you
have
a
son?
Yes.
Go
home
to
him.
Cherish
him.
Love
him.
I
wouldn't
be
here
if
I
didn't.
Mr.
Kipps.
Mr.
Daily.
Glad
you
could
make
it.
My
pleasure.
I'm
just
bidding
my
son,
My
condolences,
Mr.
Daily.
It
was
a
long
while
ago.
There's
a
place
ready
in
there
so
we
can
all
be
together
I
heard
about
the
girl
in
the
village.
Terrible.
Are
you
all
right?
Yes.
My
wife
doesn't
know

I'd
be
grateful

would
have

MRS.
DAILY:
Thank
you,
Archer.
There
you
are,
dear.
Mr.
Kipps,
I've
been
so
looking
forward
to
meeting
you.
I'm
sorry,
I
must
look
a
bit
of
a
mess.
I
found
myself
without
a
room.
Oh!
Well,
then
he
must
stay
with
Indeed
he
must,
my
dear.
Arthur.
Thank
you.
The
twins
won't
be
dining
Samuel,
I'm
sure
Mr.
Kipps
won't
mind.
Not
at
all.
Emily!
Thank
you.
There.
Now,
say
hello
to
Mr.
Kipps.
Hello.

Thank
you,
Archer.
There.
You're
married,
Mr.
Kipps?
No,
don't
gobble.
That's
rude.
Any
children?
A
son.
Oh,
that's
lovely.
You
don't
want
to
end
up
like
us.
Wealthiest
folk
in
the
county
Did
he
tell
you
about
That's
him.
I
painted
that
myself.
I
love
It's
lovely.
Nicholas
loved
to
sketch,
too.
He
still
does.
Elizabeth,
please.
He
wants
to
draw
you
a
picture.
DAILY:
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth,
no!
Elizabeth!
Archer,
the
medication!
No.
Medication!

No,
no.

I
thought
some
company
Please,
think
nothing
of
it.
She's
convinced
it's
our
son
You
don't
believe
in
this
spiritualism
I
didn't.
But
since
my
wife
passed
Ah.
Forgive
me.
I
didn't...
Sometimes
I
feel
she's
still
with
me.
Sometimes
I
just
feel
she's
there.
In
the
room.
Trying
to
reach
me.
Well,
you
must
be
careful,
Arthur.
These
charlatans
with
all
and
contacting
the
dead.
They
prey
on
those
most
in
need.
They
do
more
harm
than
good.
I
think
the
worst
they
I
have
to
keep
looking.
It's
not
natural
to
lose
But
if
we
open
the
door
where
does
that
lead?
It's
just
chasing
shadows,
Arthur.
When
we
die,
we
go
up
there.
We
don't
stay
down
here.

MRS.
DAILY:
Come
on.
Come
on.
Lie
down.

ARTHUR:
I'll
lose
my
job
if
I
don't
get
this
paperwork
done.
If
Jerome
gives
me
some
help,
I
doubt
if
Jerome
will
Stay,
Spider.
Mr.
Jerome?



GIRL:
Go
away!
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
You
killed
Victoria
Hardy.
Get
away
from
me!
Go!

Go!
Go!
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
Complete
nonsense.
Let's
get
you
to
the
house.

You
should
have
left.
You
should
John.
His
little
girl
is
dead.
You
saw
her.
You
saw
that
woman
at
the
house.
Oh,
for
God's
sake,
take
him
home.
This
isn't
helping
him.
All
your
superstitious
rubbish.
You
think
this
is
superstitious
rubbish
that
took
your
boy?
All
right.
I'll
take
him
to
the
station.

DAILY:
Pay
no
attention
to
them.
They're
still
living
in
the
Dark
Ages.
ARTHUR:
But
I
did
see
Trust
me,
Arthur.
It's
just
an
old
The
sooner
the
house
is
the
sooner
people
can
move
on.
Here.
This'll
keep
you
going.
The
late
tide
is
due
at
11
:00.
It's
fine.
I'd
rather
just
work
through
the
night.
Well,
take
the
dog.

Come
on,
girl.
Just
for
company.
Don't
go
chasing
shadows,
Arthur.



JENNET:
Dear
Alice,
you
leave
me
no
option
If
you
have
your
doctors
deem
me
mentally
unfit
what
can
I
do?
You
and
Charles
can
take
him
from
me,
but
he
is
mine,
mine,
he
can
never
be
yours.
Jennet.
Dear
Alice,
I
find
it
hard
to
express
from
you,
my
own
sister,
at
your
refusal
to
let
me
visit
my
son
or
even
give
him
my
birthday
cards.
I
begin
to
believe
you're
not
doing
this
for
but
to
cause
me
pain.
He
is
mine.
If
you
won't
let
me
see
You
didn't
try
to
save
him.
You
just
saved
yourself.
You
didn't
even
give
You
just
left
him
there
in
the
mud.
His
blood
is
on
your
hands.
I
will
never
forgive
you.
Rot
in
hell.


He
will
never
be
yours.
















Who's
there?













You
don't
believe
me,
do
you?
I
believe
even
the
most
rational
mind
can
play
tricks
in
the
dark.
I
saw
them,
Sam.
I
saw
her
and
her
boy.
No.
The
boy
was
lost
to
the
marsh.
His
body
was
never
recovered.
I
saw
them.
Oh,
my
God!

No,
don't...
Lucy!
Lucy!
Arthur!
No!
No!
Arthur!
Arthur!

Stay
there.
I'm
going
to
come
and
get
you.
No!




Arthur?
Here.
I
remember
when
the
Jeromes
lost
They
decided
to
have
another.
Lucy.
They
locked
her
up
to
protect
her.
Not
that
you
can
ever
replace...
She
was
there,
Sam.
You're
tired.
Get
some
rest.
What
happened
to
him,
Mrs.
Daily?
He
was
playing
at
the
beach
and
they
said
the
tide
must
You've
seen
her,
haven't
you?
She
was
there
this
morning
in
the
fire.

She's
always
there.
You
mustn't
blame
yourself.
Blame
myself
for
what?
For
not
listening
to
the
others.
For
not
staying
away
from
the
house.
What?
I
don't
understand.
Whenever
she's
been
seen,
on
the
causeway,
on
the
marsh,
however
briefly
and
whoever
by,
there
has
always
been
one
Yes?
In
some
violent
or
dreadful
a
child
has
died.
So
many...
So
many
children.
So
many
children.
The
Fishers'
daughters
Keckwick's
son,
my
Nicholas.
How?
Oh...
Mrs.
Daily?
Mrs.
Daily?

She
makes
us...
She
makes
us
do
it.
She
makes
us.
They
took
her
boy
away.
So
now
she
takes
us.
She
saw
you.
She
saw
you.
She's
coming.
She's
coming.
Elizabeth!
Sam!
Sam!
Elizabeth!
No,
Elizabeth.
No!
No!



Elizabeth.
ARTHUR:
Joseph.
If
we
can
get
the
telegram
off
now,
we
can
catch
them
before
How
could
you
take
me
to
Eel
Marsh?
If
even
a
small
part
of
you
feared
But
I
never
believed
them.
No,
you
didn't
want
to.
There's
a
difference.
I
Either
Nicholas
is
in
a
better
place
waiting
for
us
to
be
reunited
one
day,
or
he's
lost.
Now
which
would
you
have
Forgive
me,
Sam,
but
my
son
is
alive.
He's
on
his
way
here.
DAILY:
Oh,
no.
The
next
village
is
over
an
hour
away.
They'll
have
left
by
then.
What
time
is
the
tide
back
out?
5:00.
Why?
If
we
can
reunite
Jennet
perhaps
she'll
finally
be
at
peace.
They
never
recovered
the
But
you
have
something
they
never
had.




Arthur?
Sam,
I
feel
it.
It's
just
Just
give
me
a
moment
while
I
tie
it.
Be
careful.
Arthur?
Oh,
my
God.


Keep
driving.
Don't
stop!
The
pedal's
on
the
floor.
I've
found
the
boy.
Can
you
go
any
farther?
The
engine's
overheating!
Come
on.
Sam,
please,
it's
sinking.
Hurry!
Here,
here.

Let's
just
put
him
in
Let's
get
it
over
with.
Sam,
there's
something
I
need
to
do
first.
They're
lost.
They
need
to
find
each
other.
Nearly
time
now.







Come
on.
Nicholas?
NICHOLAS:
Daddy?


Arthur!



Arthur.
I
think
she's
gone.

Thank
you.

JENNET:
I
will
never
forgive
I
will
never
forgive.
Never
forgive.
Never
forgive.
Never
forgive.
Never
forgive.
Never
forgive.
One
step,
two
step.
Good
boy.

Joseph!
Daddy!

Joseph,
this
is
my
friend,
Sam.
Hello,
Sam.
Hello,
Joseph.
It's
very
nice
to
meet
you.
Change
of
plans.
We're
not
staying
here
tonight.
We're
going
straight
back
to
London.
Can
you
fetch
us
some
tickets?
You're
sure
you
don't
want
Yes,
I
just
want
to
get
him
home.
I
understand.
Three
tickets
back
to
London,
please.
Will
you
and
Elizabeth
be
all
right?
We
will.
Then
you
must
come
down
Elizabeth
would
love
that.




ARTHUR:
Sam?
Daddy?
Who's
that
lady?
That's
your
Mummy.
