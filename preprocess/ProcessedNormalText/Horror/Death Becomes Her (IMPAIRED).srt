Your

are
here,
A
Miss
Helen
Sharp
-
Ahh.
How's
she
look?
Helen,
you
idiot.
I
don't
know.
Classy?
Really?
Oh,
shit.


Mad!
Hel!
-
I
don't
believe
it.
-
It's
been
so
long.
Don't
you
dare
say
how
long.
Mad,
I'd
like
you
to
meet...
Dr.
Ernest
Menville,
my
fiance.
You
were
just
wonderful.
Ernest
Menville?
Dr.
Ernest
-
Yes.
You
were
so
terrific!
-
I've
read
all
about
you.
-
I
can't
believe
I'm
meeting
you.
-
We're
both
huge
fans.
Do
you?
Well,
I'm
so
happy
What
ever
happened
to
that,
-
Oh,
well,
um,
I'm
still
trying.
-
She's
a
brilliant
writer,
Mrs.
Ashton.
Tell
me,
Doctor,
do
you
think
that
Ahem.
So...
have
you
two
set
a
date?
-
Yes...
we
have.
ERNEST:
We
see
the

the
medial
canthus

are
two
fat
compartments
in
the
Oops.

at

Quickly,
please.

wants
you.
She
wants
I've
lost
men
to

before.
She
just
turns
on

That's
why
I
wanted
you
to
meet
I
just
had
to
see
if
you
could
Please...
I
couldn't
take
it
again.

I'd
do.

to

door.
I

If
you
don't

let's
go.




Lady,
listen.
You

you

up

Are
you
nuts?
Come
on.
So...
What
about
you,
Helen?
We
haven't
heard
from
you
Is
there
anything...
you'd
like
to...
Yes.
I
would
like
to
talk
about...
Madeline...
-
Ashton.
Stop!
Stop
it!
-

Is
this
where
we
are,
Helen?
Six
months
of
therapy.
And
we
are
still
talking
-
You
think
I
enjoy
talking
about
her?
Is
that
what
you
think?
Oh,
Helen,
for
any
of
us
to
have
a
life,
you
have
got
to
forget
You
have
to
erase
her
-
You
have
to
completely
eliminate
any--
You
have
to
completely
You're
right.
What?
You're
absolutely
right.
SPEAKER:
I
have
a
delivery
for
Madeline



You
look
absolutely
marvelous.
Hey,
wait
a
minute.
Aren't
you
forgetting
something?
-
It's
only
Thursday.
I'm
supposed
to--
I
think
I
need
you
Very
well.
Oh,
madam,
Thank
you,
Rose.
It's
so
sweet--

Dr.
Menville,
you're
so
cute.
Oh!

outstanding
characteristic
is
the
large,
flat
tail.

It's

Rose!
Fine,
dear,
thank
you.
You're
dressed.
-
Work.
Dr.
Menville,
-
I'm
sorry
to
call
at
the
last
minute.
He's
completely
prepped.
Our
top

Good,
I'm
sure
he'll
be
fine.
Calm?
I
am

He's

Thank
you,
Mr.
Franklin,
we'll

Oh,
no,
Dr.
Menville,
you
can't
People
have
to

him.
-
Good
afternoon,
Miss
Ashton.
Yes,
I
know.
Miss
Ashton,
how
are
you?
Listen,
I've
got
a
really
Really
important.
You
will
be
the
best
one!
I
have
to
be
better
than
that.
I
am
sorry,
is
a
very
traumatic
Our
policy
clearly
prohibits...
more
than
one
So?
It's
been
nearly
Miss
Ashton,
you
had
one
-
How
about
a
nice
collagen
buff?
You
might
as
well
ask
me
Tonight
is
-
I
could
do
your
makeup
myself.
It
does
nothing
anymore.
Are
you
listening
to
me?
You
stand
there
with
your
22-year-old
and
laugh
at
me.
Mmm.
I
could
pay
you
extra.
Something...
You
know
what
I
mean?
Money
is
no
object.
-
Ahem.
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Chagall.
Anna,
don't
talk,
just
go
away.
Leave
us
alone,
mmm?
-
I
don't
want
to
look
at
you
anymore.
Thank
you
so
much.
Please.
-
I
suppose
I
should
apologize.
I
am
very
sensitive
-
Excuse
me?
We
are
restricted
by
the...
Well,
what
more
Mmm,
mmm,
that
depends.
I
could
not
help
but
overhear
your
-
That
was
no
joke!
I
wonder,
Miss
Ashton,
if
perhaps
you
have
Lisle
Von
Rhuman?
Ah...
no.
No,
of
course
you
haven't.
Only
a
select
group.
She
may
be
able
to
help
you.
Here
is
her
address.
She
accepts
callers
day...
Eh...
It
is
a
very,
very
select
group,
Sure.
I'm
glad
this
happened,
We
shall
be
seeing
Yes,
I
think
so.
Weirdo.

Could
you
just
not
breathe?
Jesus,
what'd
she
do?
Good
evening.
Evian,
please.
-
Dr.
Menville?
-
Ernest
Menville?
-
Hi,
I'm
Vivian
Adams.
Long
ago.
I
never
had

the

Oh,
well,
thank
you
very
much.
Her
color,
her
tone.
-
You
even
brought
out
her
cheekbones.
It
was
almost
a
shame
It's
so
sweet
of
you
Can
I
ask
you
Spray
paint.
You
see,
you
can't
just
use
The
pores
are
too
dry.
You've
gotta
use
a
palette
One
day
I'm
in
the
hardware
store
and
It's
got
its
own
chemical
adhesive,
Excuse
me!
Have
you
seen
her
yet?
-
What
a
joke.
She's
not
even
here.
-
Oh,
look
over
there.
MADELINE:
Oh,
looks
as
though
-
We're
leaving.
No.
I'll
talk
to
her.
I
just
want
you
to
know
You
can
call
me
day
or
night.
I
did
give
you
all
my
numbers?
Mad?
Hel!
I
don't
believe
it!
Helen,
darling,
12
years!
And
look
at
you,
Oh,
you
haven't
changed.
Gosh,
I'm
glad
you
came.
I
spoke
to
my
P.R.
woman
"Madeline
Ashton
goes
Those
people
can
be
so
cruel.
I
fired
her.
Well,
that
was
-
Would
you
mind?
-
So,
how's
it
been?
-
Ernest
is
a
dream.
I
often
thought
to
myself
because
it
came
And
that
thought
Listen,
that
was
a
long
time
ago.
You
didn't
steal
him.
It
wasn't
you.
I
want
you
to
know
something.
I
have
never
ever
blamed
you.
-
Do
you
believe
how
she
looks?
-
Fifty.
You've
gotta
be
kidding.
I
wonder
what
her
secret
is.
-
Life
has
turned
out
as
quite
a
party.
That
was
when
I
was
old.
I
didn't
know
Never
could
lie
to
you.
I
know
about
the
kind
of...
It's
not
work.
I
would
sell
my
soul
-
Oh,
Helen,
I've
wasted
my
life.
She's
wasted
you.
She
married
and
turned
him
I
want
you
to
know
something.
I
have
never
blamed
you
I
always
knew
it
was
her.
She's
a
woman.
A
woman,
Ernest.
From
Newark,
for
God's
sakes.
I
will
never
forgive
her
Never.

MADELINE:
Dakota!
Oh!
Oh!
-
What's
wrong?
I
didn't
know
-
Oh,
my
God,
you're
not
alone.
-
I'm
completely
alone.
Actually,
completely
-
How
dare
you
make
me
feel
cheap!
-
She's
here
to--
She's
here
to
fix--
-
I'm
trying
to
tell
you--
She's
a
friend
of,
of,
-
Jesus,
at
least
lie
quickly!
Look,
you
gotta
believe
me.

Hey,
hey,
hey.
I'm
sick
of
this
shit,
-
I
am
doing
you
a
favor
here.
-
I
gave
you--
Somebody
told
me
we
look
How
do
you
think
You
never
think
Go
find
someone





Madeline!
I
need
to
speak
No.
Madeline.
I
need
to
speak
Yeah.

Geez.
-
Good
evening.
I
hope
it's
not
too--
Miss
Von
Rhuman's
expecting
you.
She
is?
Wait
here,
please.
Follow
me,
please.
Excuse
me.
WOMAN:
Make
some
room
for
my
friend,
But...
keep
your
ass
handy.
May
I
say
that
to
be
one
of
the
most
ever
to
grace
Oh.
And
that
husband
of
yours,
I
can
only
say
that
Oh.
I
just
arrived
in
town.
I
haven't
seen
an
autumn
We
are
creatures
Uh-huh.
I'm
not
really
You're
scared
as
hell...
of
the
body
you
thought
I
beg
your
pardon?
I
am
the
one
who
understands.
I
am
the
one

Who
is
it?
Madeline.
She's
not
here.
Ah,
thank
God!
How
did
you
get
in?
I
didn't
want
you
to
hear.
Ernest,
ask
me
to
go.
Ask
me
to
leave
-
You
just
got
here.
But
it
just
took
me
a
glimpse
Where's
that?
-
Don't
pretend
you're
not
aware
of
it.
You're
a
powerful
I
am?
Yes,
you
are.
If
I
never
told
you
before,
I
wasn't
the
sort
of
girl
"sexual"
without
blushing.
Well,
I
can
now.
Sexual.
Sensual.
Sexy.
Sex.
Sex.
-
Sex!
So
warm,
so
full
of
life.
And
already
This
is
life's
It
offers
us
the
taste
and
then
makes
us
Well,
it
is
the
natural
law.
Screw
the
natural
law!
What
is
that?
What
you
came
for.
A
touch
of
magic...
in
this
world
A
tonic.
A
potion.
What
does
it
do?
How
old
would
you
guess
I
am?
I
wouldn't--
Come
on.
Thirty
eight.
Oh,
twenty
eight.
I
am
seventy-one
years
old.
That's
what
it
does.
It
stops
the
aging
process
and
forces
it
into
retreat.
Drink
that
potion
and
you'll
Don't
drink
it...
and
continue
How
much
is
it?
The
sordid
topic
of
coin...
I'm
afraid
is
not
so
simple.
The
cost,
you
see,
Well,
for
me,
how
much?

Well,
thank
you
very
much.
Sit!
Hold
out
your
hand.

Watch.

Check
okay?
Fine.
But
you
must
make
me
a
promise.
The
secret
that
we
share
You
may
continue
your
career
ten
years
of
perfect,
But
at
the
end
of
that
time,
you
have
to
disappear
You
can
retire.
You
can
stage
or...
as
one
of
my
clients

No!
She's
not!
Wow!
Bottoms
up.
-
Now,
a
warning.
Take
care
of
yourself.
You
and
your
body
are
going
Be
good
to
it.
Siempre
viva.
I
can't
believe--
Oh...
I'm
a
girl!
Shh.
Ernest,
oh,
we
gotta
stop.
-

Really,
Ernest.
Oh.
Ernest,
don't
be
angry
with
me.
I'm
fighting
this
as
hard
Look
at
you!
She's
already
destroyed
Now
she's
breaking
your
heart,
stealing
your
pride,
flaunting
her
lovers...
-
all
over
town.
Everyone
does.
At
the
party,
How
can
you
love
me,
Helen?
I've
been
so
weak
for
so
long.
I
should've
divorced
Madeline
By
God,
that
is
exactly
The
first
thing
I
am
gonna
go
downtown
and
obtain
-
Ernest?
Divorce?
That's
exactly
what
You
have
no
talent
for
poverty.
You
can't
let
her
Then
there's
nothing
I
can
do.
Oh,
yes,
there
is.
HELEN:
I've
thought
this
through
Tonight,
while
she's
asleep,
and
take
one
of
each
kind
Then
you'll
take
and
lightly
coat
each
glass.
As
you
know,
Narconal
is
a
very
so
you
won't
need
much.
Tomorrow,
I'll
call
Madeline
-
I'll
get
her
to
invite
me
to
dinner.
Then,
at
dinner,
No
matter
which
glass
Narconal
will
be
on
the
glass.
You
and
I
work
together.
Then
we
load
her
in
the
car,
take
call
the
police
and
report
we've
seen
a
Some
drunk
woman
up
here
on
Mulholland's
We'll
sit
her
up
and
make
it
look
like
just
a
little
bit
We
drop
the
car
into
gear,
wedge
her
foot
clamp
her
hands
and
send
her
on
her
way.
By
the
time
the
Narconal
will
be
leaving
only
traces
of
alcohol.
She'll
be
classified
-
They'll
check
her
blood
alcohol...
And
think
nothing
more
of
it.
The
case
is
closed.
And
we're
free!
What
are
we
saying?
-
We
can't
go
through
with
this,
Helen.
After
she's
gone,
you
can
start
your
life
I
can
start
my
life
Oh,
we'll
be
so
happy!
She's
killing
you.
So...
it
would
be
Self-defense.


My
God,
it's
back!
We
have
to
talk.
-
Have
another
drink
and
go
to
bed.
You'd
like
to
see
me
drink
That
is
not
going
-
You
are
not
going
to
take
my
money!
When
was
the
last
time
you
Anything
you
had
left,
you
owed
me
You've
changed
your
hair?
What
an
eye.
Don't
wait
up.
Cheap.
What
did
you
say?
I
called
you
cheap.
Who
do
you
think
You're
a
cheap,
Who
do
you
think
you
are?
-
Nothing
like
the
woman
I
married.
-
You're
a
broad!
-
Watch
it,
Madeline.
-
Watch
what
you
say.
I
don't
have
to
take
You'll
take
everything
I
have
to
give!
You're
not
even
a
man
anymore.
A
real
man,
not
some
drunken,
who
is
just
as
dead
below
Hey,
I
might
have
more
fun
At
least
I'd
know
I'd
be
Did
you
think
that
I
was
just
going
Did
you?
You
cruel,
vicious,
Please?
Please?
Oh,
God!
Oh!
-
Madeline,
I'm
so
sorry.
Hurry!
Help
me!

Oh,
boy.
Oh,
oh.
Oh.
Oh,
boy!
Oh,
boy!
Suite
1110,
please.
Helen,
it's
me,
Ernest
Menville!
I
didn't
think
I'd
be
able
to,
I
pushed
her
down
the
stairs.
She
was
saying
the
most
I
just
had
this
feeling
inside
We're
free,
Helen.
But
I'm
Her
neck
is
broken
and
Exactly
which
part
of
the
plan
-
We

Ernest,

over

It
just
happened.
It's
better
than
an
accident.
At
least
-
Have
you
called
the
police?
Ernest,
you...
If
the
police
check
the
phone
records,
-
that
you
called
me
before
them?
-
You're
right.
-
Should
I
call
them
right
now?
We
have
to
decide
what

Well?
Okay,
I've
got
it.

At
the
foot
of

Soon
as

after?
It's

difficult
to

It's
not

science.
Ernest,
you
pushed
me

Stay
away
from
me!
You
bet
I
will!
-
Don't
come
near
me.
Don't

Huh?
Ernest!
My
ass!
I
can
see...
-
Something's
wrong
with
your
neck
too.
I
would
friggin'
well
say
so!
Oh!
Yeah.
Oh.

Ernest...
what's
wrong
with
me?
It's
a
dislocated
neck.
It
could
happen.
I've
never
seen
Yeah,
so?
Fix
it.
-
How?
I
wouldn't
know
where
For
God's
sake!

Ah!
Oh!

Honey,
I
think
I
need
a
doctor.

What's
the

guy?
Doctor,

door.
Why
don't

What
seems
to
be
the
problem?

fell
down

Right.

Does

I
do
this?

How
about
this?
-
Ah,
okay,
this?
-
This
doesn't
hurt?
Are
you
telling
me
It
doesn't

Uh-huh,

Okay,

It

It

What?
What
is

It's,
uh,
it's

It's
okeydokey.
I

that

Might
I
have
a
little
sip
of
that?
Well,
I'll
tell
you
what.
Your

in
three
