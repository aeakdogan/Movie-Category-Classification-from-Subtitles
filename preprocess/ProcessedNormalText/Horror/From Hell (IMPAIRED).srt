MAN:
Get
out
of
here!



WOMAN:


That's
better.
WOMAN:
You'll
feel
better

KATE:
There's
one
over
there.
POLLY:
Gonna
be
a
long
night,
Mary.


ANNIE:
It's
quiet,
isn't
it?
MARY:
Not
much,
love.
MAN:
Give
you
a
penny
for
a
suck.
LIZ:
Hi.
Where's
Kate?

GEORDIE:
Miss?
-What
do
you
want?
I
know
you.
Do
you
remember
me,
Mary
Kelly?
I'd
never
forget
you,
McQueen.

Will
you
stop
that?
What
does
a
whore
need
buttons
for?
I
warned
you
and
your
friends.
MARY:
I'm
working,
ain't
I?
We
all
are.
And
I
am
making
sure
I'm
providing
a
service,
Mary
Kelly.
And
I
expect
to
be
paid...
...or
else
you
will
be
very
troubled.
Now,
you
tell...
...your
five...
...friends
they
bring
me
my
money
...or
this
friend
of
mine
here...
...will
be
your
next
customer.




-You're
bloody
filthy
this
morning.
-What'd
you
get
up
to
last
night?
Give
us
a
look.
ANN:
Mary.
Thank
God
I
found
you.
He's
coming.
Albert's
coming
today.
I
need
you
to
look
after
the
baby.
Let's
have
a
hold.
ANN:
I'm
so
proud
of
her.
MARTHA:
Isn't
she
beautiful?
ANN:
She's
lovely,
isn't
she?
I'll
be
seeing
you
in
a
bit.
Get
us
a
jar
of
gin,
will
you?
You
look
fine,
Ann.
Must
be
nice,
She
has
your
eyes
and
her
father's
brow.
She
is
a
perfect
love,
but,
Ann,
-The
Nichols
gang...
-Know
what
they
said
they'd
do?
What's
she
saying?
They
want
1
a
week
from
each
of
us.
Count
yourself
lucky.
Good
and
lucky
that
you
got
We
need
4
to
pay
them,
I'll
get
you
the
4
from
Albert.
He
might
say
no.
I
can't
take
a
chance.
He
won't.
I
know
he
won't.
He's
been
in
France
on
business.
He
wrote,
he
sold
a
lot
of
his
paintings.
He's
sure
to
have
full
pockets
MARY:
To
you
perhaps,
but...
I'll
get
you
the
4.
I
promise.

I'm
not
gonna
hurt
you,
Netley.
Remember
me?
Remember
who
I
am?
Your
charge
will
be
coming
down
Be
a
good
man.
Get
him
home
quickly.
Quickly
and
quietly.
Understood?
Well
said.
Very
well
said.



Take
them
out.
What
is
the
meaning
of
this?
Kidney,
what
in
God's
name
are
you
doing?

I
want
this
room
in
pieces.

ALBERT:
I
demand
an
explanation.
It's
Albert.


ANN:
Get
off
me.

ANN:
Please.
No!

Who
knows?
I
didn't
know.
I
swear,
I
didn't.
How
can
I
tell
anyone
else?
Who
knows?
Who
knows?
I
don't
know
who
they
could
be.
Albert
must've
mixed
in
She's
hungry
and
cold,
poor
thing.

I've
got
to
take
her
to
them.
I've
got
to
take
her
to
Ann's
parents.
You
go.
Leave
baby
Alice
with
them.
I'll
get
to
work,














CORONER:
Notice
something,
Inspector?

I
pay.
I
already
pay.
I'm
not
after
you,
Emperor.
Where
is
he?
Move
it!
Get
up.
Get
up!
Hello,
darling.
Sergeant.
It's
night.
Well
spotted,
Inspector
Abberline.
Our
genius
has
returned
to
us.
Thank
you,
gentlemen.
Remember,
if
you
ever
wish
to
escape
...this
never
happened.
Cut
along
now.
Have
I
lost
a
day?
No.
It's
only
four
hours
since
you
left
here.
Deepest
apologies
for
the
rude
awakening.
I
suspect
you
enjoyed
that.
"I
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind,"
Although,
I'd
happily
wallop
you
I
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
You've
seen
something?
What
did
you
see?
A
petticoat
saturated
with
blood.
They
used
to
burn
men
like
you
alive.
Sometime
this
evening,
That
doesn't
sound
It
was
the
way
she
was
done.
It
was
the
way
the
bangtail
was
done


POLICE
SURGEON:
I
don't
know
what
sort
of
name
Tabram
is.
It
sounds
foreign
to
me.
This
is
not
what
I
saw.
Not
the
woman
of
your
dreams?
Are
you
sure?
-Show
him.
Why
do
I
have
to
be
exposed
I've
looked
at
the
mess
twice.
Before
he
cut
her
throat,

SIR
WILLIAM:
Gentlemen,
...to
be
able
to
observe
an
entirely
new
Dr.
Ferral,
I
was
just
saying
...we're
here
in
the
hope
you'll
permit
us
I
wasn't
expecting
But
you're
all
welcome,
of
course.
I'm
ready
to
begin.
SIR
WILLIAM:
Who
is
your
patient?
An
unfortunate,
Sir
William,
And
has
severe
delusions
of
persecution.
Poor
girl.
Do
please
proceed.
Gentlemen.


We
have
one
tap
above...
...and
one
into
the
left
lobe.
And...
...one
on
the
right...
...and
this
unlucky
patient's
dementia...
...will
no
longer
take
a
violent
form.
Thanks
to
this
simple
procedure...
...we
can
now
permanently
alleviate

MARY:
What
could
I
do?
Rich
man?
Knew
that
was
too
good
to
be
true.
KATE:
They're
gonna
kill
every
one
of
us.
Who
is
this
Albert
anyway?
Who
cares
about
Albert
What
are
we
gonna
do?
We
can't
stay
clear
They
say
that
they
held
...and
watched
her
bleed
Then
they
cut
her
throat.
McQueen
is
mad.
POLLY:
It's
insane
that
they
want
4.
Not
with
my
old
cunny.
BARTENDER:
Behave
yourselves
LIZ:
You
can
bugger
off.
KATE:
We
work,
girls.
We
work
the
streets
harder
than
ever.
Right?
POLLY:
All
right.
POLLY:
The
bobbies
are
tracking
us.
Gotta
get
the
old
man
hard
first.
POLLY:
Give
it
here.
I'll
put
it
in
meself.

-ls
that
in?
It's
not.
POLLY:
No,
I
haven't.
Come
on.
MAN:
I
knows
it
when
I
feels
it.

That's
mine,
Polly.
That's
my
money.
I
could
pop
your
eye
out.
The
customers
wouldn't
mind.
They
don't
mind
if
a
whore
can
see.
OFFICER:
What's
that
you
got?
What
have
I
got
here,
Constable?
Only
a
little
thing
to
you,
OFFICER:
Move!
You're
a
dead
woman.
LIZ:
Lovey,
ANNIE:
That's
right.
Look.
One
for
the
Nichols,
and
one
for
me.
LIZ:
Come
here.

We'll
work
the
streets
together.
I'll
keep
my
eye
on
you,
love.
You
pig!
You
disgusting
pig!

Yeah,
I'm
a
pig.
I'm
what's
wrong
with
the
world.
Be
on
your
own
then.
POLLY:
No!
LIZ:
You
don't
want
the
company
of
a
pig!
What
the
fuck
are
you
looking
at?
THE
RIPPER:
Thirsty?
POLLY:
Yes.
That
was
the
thing
that
was
in
my
dream.
POLLY:
What's
it
called
again?
Cleopatra.
She
was
a
beauty,
wasn't
she?
THE
RIPPER:
It
was
carved
1,500
years
Six
men
died
to
bring
it
here...
...from
Egypt.



OFFICER:
May
the
good
Lord
have
mercy.

OLD
MAN:
She
was
like
that
WOMAN:
What
kind
of
monster
did
this?

GODLEY:
The
boys
have
made
rounds
...and
the
delightful
domiciles
Will
it
surprise
you
Her
throat
was
cut,
She
was
killed
somewhere
else.
It
rained
last
night,
didn't
it?
She's
dry.
She
was
brought
here
Her
throat
must've
been
cut
I
imagine
they
stopped
it
over
there.
They?
There's
more
than
one?
Most
definitely.
This
was
all
in
your
vision?

GODLEY:
Jesus!
So,
definitely
more
than
one
person.
It
has
to
be
a
message
What
the
hell?
That's
grapes,
isn't
it?
What
the
hell
would
a
bangtail

I'd
like
to
give
them
an
answer.
-What?
I'd
welcome
the
opportunity
to
give
There
is
most
definitely
a
message
here.
What
am
I
wrong
about?
Martha
Tabram
was
raped,
That's
cruel.
But
I've
seen
that
sort
of
cruelty
This
is
methodical.
The
butchery
is
irrational,
yet...
...meticulous
and
deliberate.
Altogether
a
different
breed
of
killer.
As
soon
as
possible,
What
do
you
mean
"what
he
took"?
-Didn't
you
notice?
He's
taken
at
least
one
of
her
organs.
Oh,
no.
I
want
every
veterinarian...
...butcher,
furrier
in
the
district
Furrier?
What
did
he
do,
sir?
Skin
her?
Pipe
down,
Withers.
When
the
Inspector
is
talking
Yes,
Sergeant.
He
disemboweled
her.
After
he
cut
her
throat,
...cut
open
her
stomach,
At
least
one
of
her
organs
was
removed.
I'm
waiting
for
the
police
surgeon's
report
SIR
CHARLES:
I
see.
One
thing's
for
certain,
Maybe
one
of
these
Red
Indians...
...wandered
into
Whitechapel
With
all
due
respect,
sir...
...I
believe
this
was
done
by
someone
with
-An
educated
man,
such
as
a
doctor...
No
well-bred
man
would
do
this.
Probably
a
tradesman
or
a
butcher.
A
tradesman
is
a
possibility,
sir.
But
there's
a
strong
indication
against
it.
There
was
a
sprig
of
grapes
What
are
you
driving
at?
No
one
in
Whitechapel,
no
matter
Obviously,
It
follows
that
he
must
be
What
about
the
Jews?
A
Jew
butcher?
Or
a
Jew
tailor
might
have
money.
Sir,
for
the
sake
of
public
safety
...l'd
like
to
be
careful
about
spreading
I
know
your
reputation
for
making
guesses
Someone
told
me
Frankly,
it
doesn't
matter
to
me
But
be
certain
you
don't
proceed
Of
course,
sir.
Personally,
I
don't
care.
The
fewer
But
the
sooner
you
find
this
butcher
...the
sooner
we
can
all
celebrate
Keep
me
informed.

VICTORIA:
I
have
wonderful
news.
FREDERICK:
Tell
me.
Surely
you,
of
all

can
guess.
FREDERICK:

says

GODLEY:
"Ay,
to

go

"To

FREDERICK:
Good
afternoon,
ladies.
I'm
Inspector
Abberline.
We're
investigating
the
murders
We
understand
they
were
both
friends
Close
friends.
LIZ:
Don't
know
nothing.
ANNIE:
Me
neither.
Why
are
you
bothering
us?
-ls
he
the
boss
of
Nichol
Street?
Isn't
it
your
job
to
be
knowing
What
makes
you
think
McQueen
did
this?
Can't
prove
nothing
by
me.
-You're
Mary
Kelly,
right?
FREDERICK:
Unless
one
of
you
...I
can't
do
nothing.
Surely,
Inspector...
...a
strong,
handsome
man
like
you...
...could
do
anything
I'm
a
coward
and
a
weakling.
What's
your
excuse?
KATE:
Come
on,
Mary.
They
won't
help
us.
Is
that
you?
Before
my
mother
died,
back
in
Ireland.
-ls
that
when
you
came
here?
-When
I
was
8.
MARY:
We
were
starving,
I
was
thinking...
...we
ain't
never
gonna
earn
enough
...and
feed
our
own
mouths.
You
said
those
men...
...who
took
the
rich
artist
man
You
said
they
was
clean-shaven,
MARY:
Right.
They
weren't
the
Nichols
boys.
They
was
unusual.
Perhaps
even
official.
What
are
you
getting
at?
Maybe
we
could
go
with
the
papers,
ANNIE:
"Where's
Ann
Crook?"
The
papers
are
always
desperate
It's
a
mystery,
to
boot.
Not
a
bad
plan.
What
do
you
think,
Mary?
We
should
talk
to
that
inspector,
Fuck
me!
No.
If
we
go
to
the
papers,
they
might
hurt
Ann
Worse
than
what'll
happen
to
her
MARY:
I
don't
know
for
sure.
But
I
think
we're
better
off
Lord,
you
are
young
after
all.
Four
bitches.
That's
what
I
thought.
You
only
paid
for
one
person.
MARY:
They're
my
guests.
Let
me
welcome
your
guests.
Go
on!
Get
out!
Get
out
of
here,
you
bloody
whores.
When
you
have
four
pence...
...you
can
come
back
LIZ:
Shut
up.
ANNIE:
Back
to
work
then.
Let's
try
and
stay
together.
-We
can't.
You
know
that.
Come
on.
LIZ:
All
right,
Annie?
ANNIE:
Bloody
bastard.
LIZ:
How's
your
head?







NETLEY:
Boo!

NETLEY:
I
didn't
frighten
you,
did
I?
I've
been
looking
for
you.
Been
looking
all
over
for
you.
You've
been
looking
for
me?
Not
for
me.
On
behalf
of
my
gentleman.
A
very
fine
gentleman.
Your
gentleman
sent
you
to
find
me?
Get
off!
I
might
be
unfortunate,
It's
the
truth!
The
God's
truth.
He's
seen
you.
He
likes
you.
He
said,
tonight,
only
you'll
do.
He
said
to
find
you,
take
you
to
You're
very
pretty.


NETLEY:
Go
on.
Get
in,
I'll
take
you
there.
I
almost
forgot.
-You
like
grapes?
Your
gentleman,
he
must
be
very
refined.
ANNIE:
Very
refined
indeed.
-I'll
take
you
there.

NETLEY:
Here
we
are.
ANNIE:
I'm
a
lucky
lady.
ANNIE:
Your
gaffer,
NETLEY:
Just
the
usual,
I
expect.
This
alley
takes
you
to
the
yard.
My
gentleman
is
quiet.
What
I
want
to
know
is,
a
toff
like
him...
...how
much
is
he
offering?
NETLEY:
Here,
2
for
now.
That'll
do
me.
Let
me
see
you.
ANNIE:
Down
there?
ANNIE:
Straight
down
there,
right?









POLICEMAN:
You
watch
your
mouth!

BEST:
Any
more
information?
Is
it
true
you
found
a
piece
No.
But
if
it's
your
fancy,
I'd
be
delighted
BEST:
Give
us
a
tidbit,
Sergeant.
WOMAN:
Do
something
about
this.
MAN:
There's
a
bloody
murderer

This
is
Annie.
GODLEY:
Yes.
Annie
Chapman.
Dark
Annie,
they
called
her.
Did
the
constable
show
you
the
bit
Could
be
part
of
a
butcher's
apron.
Leather
apron.
Dear
God,
I
saw
her.
-This
one?

I
saw
her
face.
POLICEMAN:
Don't
trample
over
this
area.
WOMAN:
Come
on,
let
us
see.
There's
your
typical
Londoner...
...imbued
with
the
Christian
spirit
Or
fellow
whore,
in
this
case.
He's
really
outdone
himself
this
time.
He
not
only
severed
the
intestines...
...he's
carefully
arranged
them
I
think
he's
taken
more
organs
this
time.
Grapes
again.
Why
grapes?
Only
Polly
and
Dark
Annie
Only
they
were
disemboweled
This
ain't
killing
for
profit.
This
is
ritual.
Yeah,
but
why
grapes?
So
they'll
trust
whatever
he
offers.
I've
never
fully
understood
that
tradition.
They're
for
the
ferryman.
The
ferryman
who
takes
the
body
If
she
don't
have
the
money
to
pay
him...
...she'd
have
to
wander,
I
need
to
consult
a
doctor.
Are
you
ill,
Inspector?
A
surgeon,
to
be
specific.
The
killer
removed
My
God.
He's
out
of
his
mind.
That's
very
astute
of
you,
sir.
I
don't
appreciate
sarcasm,
Inspector.
FREDERICK:
I'm
sorry,
sir.
You
already
have
a
surgeon
I
need
a
man
with
a
strong
stomach
The
police
surgeon
has
neither.
SIR
CHARLES:
No.
Request
denied.
Are
you
questioning
my
decision?
No,
sir.
I
simply
want
to
know
why.
There's
already
too
much
nonsense
You
start
consulting
doctors,
and
No
one
else
is
to
see
the
bodies.

Pardon
me,

Are
you
Dr.
Ferral?
I
am.
I'm
Inspector
Abberline,
Oh,
my
Lord!
You're
the
Ripper
case.
-Am
I
right?
Jolly
good.
You've
come
to
the
perfect
place.
I
see.
I
could
certainly
use
your
expertise
They
tell
me
you're
FERRAL:
Really?
I
don't
see
how
a
reputable
surgeon

country's

Socialists
trying
to
stir
things
up
That's
who
you
should
be
pursuing,
Excuse
me.

SIR
WILLIAM:
I'm
afraid
Dr.
Ferral
suffers
FREDERICK:
What's
that,
sir?
Want
of
feeling.
He
knows
everything
about
anatomy
How
may
I
assist
you,
Inspector?
Forgive
my
ignorance,
but...
...are
you
a
surgeon?
I
was.
Unfortunately,
-I'm
sorry
to
hear
that,
sir.
So
you
see,
I'm
accustomed
to
FREDERICK:
Could
you
tell
me

I
think
you
mean
to
draw
a

It's
named
for

Because
there
was

had

Do
you,
by
any
chance,
FREDERICK:
Yes,
I
do,
sir.
FREDERICK:
SIR
WILLIAM:
Of
course.
Thank
you.

Wouldn't

Not
if
he
cut
their
throats
first.
Yes.
How
can
you
be
sure
they
wouldn't
Grapes.
He
offers
them
grapes
first.
-Grapes
are
very
tempting.
He
might
offer
them
a
drink
A
drink
laced
with
laudanum.
SIR
WILLIAM:
How
do
you
know
that?
I
found
a
sprig
of
grapes
And
I
smelled
the
laudanum
on
their
lips.
Laudanum
is
a
derivative
of
opium.
Apart
from
doctors
and
addicts,
How
long
have
you
SIR
WILLIAM:
These
should

That'll
help
to
restore

Thank
you
very
much,
sir.
-I'm
a
fool.

Far
from
it.
I
ought
to
have
known
that
you're
It's
certainly
an
honor,
but
it's
an
honor
Now,
about
our
friend
here.
Therefore,
he's
right-handed.
Excuse
me.
He
had
to
slice
through
...and
up
to
an
inch
of
subcutaneous
fat.
After
that...
...he
entered
the
abdominal
cavity,
so
he
Perhaps
he
was
carrying
What
do
you
think?
Is
it
possible
that

Perhaps
someone
who
studied
medicine,
The
intestines
are

enough,
The
liver,
very
hard
to
locate,
And
he
was
working
quickly,
in
the
dark.
I
had
held
out
hope
that
this...
...monster
was
a
veterinarian
or
a
furrier...
...or
an
especially
well-educated
butcher.
No,
I
must
admit,
if
I
were

look

QUEEN:
How
far
advanced
SIR
WILLIAM:
No
lesions
have
appeared.
There
is
some
neural
damage,
...but
I'm
more
than
hopeful,
He
seems,
to
us,
Is
the
disease
affecting
his
emotions?
Yes,
of
course,
his
mood
is
depressed...
...because
of
the
news
of
the
diagnosis.
But
that
should
improve
You
are
a
true
physician,
Sir
William.
In
all
ways,
We
are
grateful.
Thank
you,
ma'am.
FREDERICK:
This
is
the
beginning
-Like
the
bloody
Jewish
star!
The
Inspector
is
talking,
-I'm
listening,
sir.
This
area
would
form
a
likely
point.
I
want
double
shifts
And
don't
only
worry
Stop
anyone
suspicious...
...including
well-dressed
gentlemen.
By
the
way,
Withers...
...the
Star
of
David
has

points.
Right!
"Once
more
unto
the
breach,
Dismissed!

THE
RIPPER:
Why
have
you
called
me
here?
It's
just...
It's
just,
I
can't
take
it,
sir.
It's
everywhere.
It's
in
all
the
papers.
I'm
just
a
simple
chap,
sir.
I'm
not
a
great
man
like
you.
I
just
don't
know
where
I
am
at
anymore.
THE
RIPPER:
There,
there,
Netley.
I
shall
tell
you
where
we
are.
We
are
in
the
most
extreme
A
radiant
abyss,
I
don't
understand
that.
I
don't
understand,
sir.
THE
RIPPER:
Hell,
Netley.
We're
in
Hell.


MARY:
Let
me
go!
Get
your
hands
off
me!
GODLEY:
Sorry
about
that,
Inspector.
She's
madly
in
love
with
me,
You
said
McQueen
killed
your
two
friends.
I
see.
Women
are
butchered
...and
you
can't
do
piss
about
it,
We're
watching.
Can't
arrest
them
FREDERICK:
What
else
can
we
do?
If
you
keep
meself
and
me
friends
alive,
To
what,
precisely?
McQueen
said
he'd
cut
me
-No.
You
asked
me
to
testify.
I
won't.
I
promise
I
won't.
You
testify
against
McQueen,
But
his
boys,
they'll
take
their
revenge
I
can't
let
you
do
it.
WOMAN:
It's
your
round
this
time!
MARY:
I
confess,
I
have
an
appetite.
One
day,
I'll
be
a
great
big,
round
woman
And
a
dozen
plump
children,
I
imagine.
Do
you
think
that's
funny?
An
unfortunate
like
me
No,
I
didn't
mean
that
at
all.
You'll
be
a
wonderful
mother
someday.
Honest,
I
can
see
it.
I
see
you
in
a
little
cottage
by
the
sea...
...surrounded
by
children.
I
can
see
it,
Mary,
clear
as
day.
-I
really
do
have
visions,
you
know.
Sgt.
Godley
calls
it
my
intuition.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
You
have
visions
about
me?
What
might
those
be?
I
want
you
to
think
carefully.
Besides
McQueen,
...has
anything
happened
to
you
or
your
Ben

would

I
don't
know
what
you're
thinking,
-Mr.

wants
to
see
me.
Didn't
say
where.
Could
be
for
the
night.
No.
He
said
he'd
be
back
before
11:00,
Where
are
you
going?
He
said
I
should
wait
in
his
office.
And
what
floor
is
Mr.
Kidney's
office
on?
I
don't
know
what

told

You

if
she's
in
there,
I'm
going
with
you
right
now,
I
mean
it.
There
are
a
number
of
mental
disorders
...the
front
part
of
the
brain.
Her
records
indicate
that
she
was
violent...
...threatening
to
do
harm
to
herself
-Does
she
have
any
relations?
-That's
a
lie.
You're
under
arrest,
-Keep
your
mouth
shut!
Is
that
clear?
Good.
What
else
do
you
know
about
her?
All
we
know
is
...who
lived
in
the
Whitechapel
district.
I'd
like
to
ask
her
a
few
questions.
You
won't
get
any
sense
out
of
her.
I'm
used
to
that.
FREDERICK:
Hello.
I
brought
Mary
Kelly.
Do
you
remember
Mary
Kelly?
Ann...
...you
know
me,
Go
away.
Go
away.
I'm
going
to
find
baby
Alice.
Alice
is
laughing
to
me.
Laughing
to
me.
Laughing
to
me
all
day
long.
MARY:
It's
all
right,
darling.
What
about
her
father?
Have
you
seen
Alice's
father,
Ann?
He's
a
prince.
A
prince.
A
prince.
A
prince.
And
I'm
a
queen.
FREDERICK:
How
do
you
know
MARY:
He
hired
us
to
pose
What
exactly
does
that
entail,
We
stood
very
still,
so
he
could
paint
us.
What's
the
matter?
I'm
sorry,
I'm
an
unfortunate,
not
a
whore.
England
doesn't
have
whores...
...just
a
great
mass
So
Ann
Crook...
...and
the
painter
became
lovers.
He
married
her
in
a
lovely
Catholic
church.
Saint
Savior's.
Married
her
in
a
Catholic
church?
What
do
you
think
they've
done
MARY:
Special
Branch
dumped
her
FREDERICK:
Yeah,
as
an
unknown.
MARY:
Why?
FREDERICK:
When
I
find
out,
I'll
tell
you.
-Take
me
to
her.
You
have
to.
FREDERICK:
I
need
to
know
more
first.
Look...
...I
promise
that
I'll
help
you
You've
got
to
trust
me,
Mary,
I
do.
I
do
trust
you.
Good.
Do
you
have
little
ones,
Inspector?
No.
No.
A
year
ago...
No,
two
years...
I'm
sorry,
more
than
two
years...
...my
wife
passed
away...

birth
to

I'm
told
was
a

I'm
sorry.
Thanks.
I
want
to
show
you
some
paintings
-You're
going
to
take
me
into
the
gallery?
FREDERICK:
Come
on.

-Did
you
see
the
look
on
her
face?
She's
a
fright.
Look
at
those
cold
eyes.
I

a
vital
one.
That
proves
it.
I
couldn't
understand
why

so
savagely,

punishing
them.
He
wants
revenge.
Don't

No,

Fetch
the

Go

along.


THE
RIPPER:
Excuse
me,
miss.



You

Nice

There's

on
the

You

have
a
look
at
it.
GODLEY:

It's
hardly
Shakespeare,
but
it'll
do.
POLICEMAN:
Madam,
slow
down.
Make
sure
you
get
the
apron
as
well.
It
was
written
by
the
killer,
sir.
And
how
do
you
know
that?
I
was
here
three
quarters
of
an
hour
ago.
This
building,
mostly
Jews
live
here.
Yeah,
that's
right.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Ready
now,
sir.
Put
that
away,
Abberline?
-Wash
that
off.
-You
heard
me.
Listen
to
me.
In
another

there
will

I
don't
know
what
this
refers
to...

I'm
sure
it's
got
nothing
to
do
Sergeant,
I
want
two
constables
What
are
you
looking
to
him
for?
Wash
it
off!
Yes,
sir.
FREDERICK:
Six
men
have
seen
it
already,
I'll
remember
these
words
So
all
you're
doing
No,
all
I
am
doing
is
taking
charge
...that
you
have
bungled
to
the
point
You
are
suspended
from
duty,
Abberline.
Inspector
Abberline
is
suspended.
All
of
his
privileges
are
cancelled.
You
have
not
seen
her,
then?
If
she
comes
around,
give
her
this.
Long
letter,
eh?
FREDERICK:
This
is
for
your
trouble.
The
letter's
private,
you
understand?
I
understand.


MASON'S
VOICE:
Who

this?
MASON'S

GODLEY:

Why

Only
me.
I

You

I

I

I

Beautiful
Mary.
It's
all

Pardon?
Here's
to

I'm
so
sorry
to

this,

I'm

Will
you

SIR
WILLIAM:
Yes.
And
how
these
women
were
killed...
...throats
cut
left
to
right...
...their
organs
removed.
They're
reenactments,
aren't
they?
Reenactments
of
what?
The
Jews.
The
traitors
who
killed
Hiram
Abiff,
That's
how
they
were
ex
ecuted.
Yes,
so
the
Great
Book
tells
us.
So
Jack
the
Ripper
He's
executing
traitors.
He's
a
Mason
fulfilling
a
duty.
Yes,
I'm
afraid,
Inspector...
...that
you
won't
be
permitted
I
don't
want
to
arrest
him.
The
Ripper
has
one
more
traitor
...and
I
will
stop
him.
Did
they
come
to
you,
sir...
...as
a
loyal
Mason?
Did
they
ask
you
to
help
them
That's
how
it
started,
yes.
And
then
you
discovered
He's

of

Inspector.

FERRAL:
Don't

You'll
only

this
more
painful.


MAN
#1:
Are
you
all
right?
MAN
#2:
There's
someone
under
there.





MAN'S
VOICE:
Dr.
Gull?
Yes.
MAN'S
VOICE:
Yes.
Yes.
The
human
heart...
...is
a
dense
and
powerful
muscle...
...much
like
the
organic
equivalent
...and
notoriously
difficult
to
burn.
It's
about
the
size
of
a
fist.
It
provides
the
motor
power
The
heart
contains
two
atria,
SIR
WILLIAM:
...powering
a
double
circuit.
In
the
adult,
the
heart
rate
averages
Such
is
the
force
of
the
heart
beat...
...that
if
the
body's
largest
artery,
...a
six-foot
jet
of
blood...
...is
released.

MASON:
...fear
no
God.
Arise.
Your
faith
is
well-founded.

MAN:
Another
murder!
Don't
go
in
there.
There's
no
need.
How
bad
is
it?
She's
in
pieces,
sir.
Sergeant,
he
can
go
in.
Give
him
to
me.
He'll
be
taken
care
of.
I
swear.
-I
want
him.
Fuck
your
word!
I'll
bring
every
last
one
of
you
You
and
your
fucking
brothers.
Listen
to
me.
Your
difficult
situation
has
been
You
are
reinstated.
No!
This
is
not
helping
anything.
Don't
be
a
fool,
Inspector.
You
will
be
very
closely
watched.
MAN:
You're
all
there
now.
WOMAN:
All
right
for
you,
Inspector
Abberline
is
in
charge.
Give
him
all
the
assistance
he
requires.
GODLEY:
Remember,
Men,
clear
this
passage.
Move
them
away.
POLICEMAN:
Move
back.
Make
way.
Shall
we
proceed,
Inspector?
CORONER:
Body
lies
in
middle
of
bed.
Shoulders
flat,
The
left
arm
is
close
to
the
body.
The
forearm
flexed
at
a
right
angle,
The
right
arm
is
slightly
abducted
It
rests
on
the
mattress,
with
The
fingers
are
clenched,
Notice
something,
Inspector?
No.
No,
go
on.
Came
in
not
long
before
dawn,
Left
this
for
you.
MARY:
"I
know
you
asked
me
to
wait.
"If
I'm
to
be
murdered,
"I'm
going
to
the
orphanage
"Here's
an
address
where
you
can
find
us.
"We'll
wait
for
you
eagerly.
"I
know
in
my
heart,
"Just
as
you
saw.
"I
hope
to
be
with
you
soon,
dearest.
"All
my
love,

QUEEN:
We
asked
Sir
William
to
remove
a
threat
Not
to
engage
in
these
ghastly
rituals.
Of
course
not,
Your
Majesty.
On
the
other
hand,
The
threat
is
past,
Your
Majesty.
In
his
way,
Sir
William
has
been
loyal.
And
we
are
grateful
for
that.
The
rest
is
in
your
hands,
Lord
Hallsham.
We
wish
to
hear
nothing
further
of
this.
Knight
of
the
East.
We
are
gathered
here,
...and
before
the
sight
of
You
stand
accused
of
mayhems
that
You
stand
before
your
peers,
I
have
no
peers
present
here.
What?
No
man
amongst
you
is
fit
to
judge...
...the
mighty
art
that
I
have
wrought.
Your
rituals
are
empty
oaths
The
Great
Architect
speaks
to
me.
He
is
the
balance,
Not
you.
Knight
of
the
East...
...hear
our
judgment.





They're
not
watching
you
anymore.
I'm
telling
you,
it's
safe
to
go
to
her.
They
think
she's
dead.
If
I
disappear,
...they
might
wonder
why.
GODLEY:
That
old
bugger
in
the
pub
...because
as
soon
as
he's
had
a
few
drinks,
Is
that
what
you
want?
Do
you
want
to
live
the
rest
of
your
life
No.
What
I
want
is
to
go
to
her.
But
at
the
slightest
hint
she's
alive,
...and
no
trouble.
So
I'll
stay.
And
watch
them.

MARY:
Alice!
Come
here,
darling.
Coming,
Mother.
Get
up.
Get
up!
Come
on.
GODLEY:
"Good
night,
sweet
prince."
