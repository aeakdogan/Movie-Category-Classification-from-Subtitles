Let

Hey,
Carlos,
this
is

Yeah.
It's
all
clear.
Somebody

It's
nothing.
But
if
you
insist...
That's
right.
So
sit
back
and
relax.
Spread
out.
Look
for
anything

You
like

Oh,
I've

I
think
that's

I'll
be

How
do
you
do
that?
It's
a
dying
art,
unfortunately.
This
is
the
last
of
it.
-
I
think
it's
some
kind
of
fruit.
Sorry,
that's
all
we
have.
Fruit.
You
want
some
fruit?

it's
the

Hi.
Hey.
This
belong
to
you?
I
gave
it
to
you
last
night.
For
luck.
Thank
you.
What's
your
name?
K-Mart.
It's
where
they
found
me.
Claire
and
the
other...
A
few
years
back.
Do
you
have
another
name?
Never
liked
it.
Everyone
I
knew
was
dead...
...so
seemed
like
time
for
a
change.
Anyone
want
to
say
something?
Alice,
this
is
Claire
Redfield.
She's
the
one
who
put
this
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
help.
Claire!
Excuse
me.
I
have
things
In
the
last
six
months,
Pretty
soon
there'll
be
Alice,
what
happened
to
you?
Why
did
you
leave
after
Detroit?
I
didn't
have
a
choice.
What
do
you
mean?
They
were
tracking
me.
I
couldn't
be
around
you.
-
I
would've
gotten
you
all
killed.
Broke
into
an
Umbrella
facility
...downloaded
the
satellite
...and
stayed
off
the
grid.
And
after
the
world
ended?
Why
stay
out
there
alone?
It's
just
safer
Why'd
you
come
back?
Damn!
What
time
is
it?
Chase,
what
time
is
it?
Well,
Carlos,
it
is
12:14.
Why?
Guess
I'm
just
being
paranoid.
Welcome
home.
Got
a
minute?
Yeah.
Everyone
is
grateful
But
how
long
am
I
goanna
stay?
Don't
get
me
wrong.
We
really
are
grateful.
They're
all
talking
about
what
you
did.
I
don't
blame
them.
People
have
a
habit
Not
just
you.
You're
positive
it's
her?
Sixty-two
percent.
If
it
is
Project
Alice,
she's
been
I've
re-routed
We
can
reacquire
the
subject.
I
can
have
a
strike
team
ready
No.
We'll
establish
One
hundred
percent.
The
group
she's
with
The
original
Project
Alice
...to
the
whole
process
...her
genetic
structure,
is
the
key.
The
longer
she's
out
there,
-
I
can't
risk
that.
Take
no
action
until
this
matter
has
...at
the
next
scheduled
meeting.
...that's
an
order.
These
transmissions
are
the
best
-
Alaska?
We
can't
just
ignore
it.
Any
idea
what
kind
-
Yeah.
A
long
one.
You
have
no
guarantee
there's
even
-
These
transmissions
say
that...
How
many
radio
broadcasts
How
many
times
The
transmissions
say
that
It's
isolated.
Safe.
This
convoy
trusts
me
These
people
don't
need
Maybe
that's
exactly
what
they
need.
Look
at
them,
Claire.
Six
months
ago,
there
were
50
of
us,
They're
starting
to
give
up.
They
need
some
kind
of
hope.
We
have
a
decision
to
make.
And
it's
too
big,
it's
too
important
There's
a
chance
Where?
In
Alaska.
There
is
a
chance...
...that
the
infection
But
we
don't
know
for
sure.
So
we
have
a
choice.
We
stay
as
we
are...
...or
we
try
for
Alaska.
For
Alaska.
Alaska.
I
hope
you're
right.
God.
The
food's
virtually
gone
I've
got
half
a
tank
of
gas.
That's
it.
-
Chase?
I
got
enough
for
If
we're
goanna
make
this
trip,
Yep.
These
are
our
options.
The
nearest,
safest
bet
No,
it's
empty.
I
tried
that.
Then,
well,
maybe...
-
We
could
try
this...
It's
the
only
place
we're
sure
to
find
There's
a
reason
for
that.
It's
crawling
with
them
We've
drained
every
small
town
dry
We
have
to
hit
a
big
city.
She's
right.
Vegas,
it's
our
only
bet.
We'll
establish
One
hundred
percent.
Take
no
action
until
this
matter
has
Doctor...
...
that's
an
order.
The
committee
authorizes
Release
of
vehicles

under
command
of
Dr.
Isaacs.
That's
an
order.
Hey.
You
all
right?
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
The
pork
and
beans,
they
lethal.
Years
of
practice.
Oh,
my
God.
What
happened
to
it?
The
desert
must
have
taken
it
back.
Five
years.
No
one
to
keep
the
sand
back.
It's
empty.
No
undead.
Nothing.
Those
birds
must
have
moved
Picked
it
clean.
I
don't
see
any
truck
stops.
Where
are
they?
There.
Valet
parking
at
the
casino
There's
gas
pumps
in
there.
Now,
how
do
you
know
that?
I
dropped
two
G's
You
lost
$2000?
Damn
it.
Spread
them
out!
We're
goanna
have
to
move
it.
All
right,
Chase,
I
need
a
lookout!
Up
there.
Great.
Climb
the
Eiffel
Tower
A
few
years
ago,
Well,
let
the
good
times
roll.
Let's
get
this
done.
Get
the
hell
out
of
here.
-
Yeah.
Wait.
Get
back!
-
Carlos,
cover
me!
Move!
Just
get
to
the
back
and
stay
quiet.
Get
down!
She
really
is
magnificent.
When
she's
dead,
I
need
a
sample
of
her
blood
That
won't
be
a
problem.
-
Satellite
in
position?
Then
shut
her
down.
Mickey!
Hey!
Mickey!
No!
No!
She's
fighting
the
conditioning.
Boost
the
control
signal.
Shit!
Climb!
Give
me
your
hand!
Run!
Go!
Go!
Run!
Let's
go!
L.J.!
L.J.
What
is
it?
Satellite.
Some
kind
of
malfunction.
How
long?
New

coming
online
Online
in

two...
Now.
Where
the
hell
is
she
going?
Shut
her
down!
She's
still
coming!
-
Now!
You
son
of
a...
Back
to
base!
The
anti-virus!
Why
didn't
you
shoot?
Because
we're
not
driving
to
Alaska.
Let's
go
look
at
the
computer,
-
How
is
he?
...as
you
instructed.
How
much
of
this
have
you
used?
Her
blood
increased
It
also
increased
the
strength
I
needed
it.
You
have
no
idea
Oh,
I
have
an
idea.
You're
out
of
control.
Well,
this
ends
here.
Under
executive
order
1345,
...for
gross
misconduct
in
the
field...
...I
sentence
you
to
Liquidation?
Just
die.
Take
the
body
to
the
surface.
Sir!
Good
thing
we
like
a
challenge.
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
They
have
the
anti-virus
in
there.
Just
hold
on.
It's
too
late,
and
you
know
it.
Besides,
you
need
a
way
And
I
have
an
idea.
-
You
keep
them
safe,
huh?
Come
here.
Carlos,
l...
Save
it.
You
just
promise
me
one
thing.
When
you
get
down
there...
Consider
it
done.
Wish
I
had
a
smoke.
Fuck!
I'll
be
damned.
L.J.,
you
sneaky
son
of
a
bitch.
Oh,
hell.
Come
on.
Get
the
kids
out
quickly!
Go!
-
Run!
Run!
Hurry
up!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Take
him!
You're
not
coming?
Take
care
of
the
others.
I'm
sorry.
-
I
am
the
artificial
intelligence...
I
knew
your
sister.
She
was
a
homicidal
bitch.
My
sister
computer
was
merely
...for
the
preservation
of
human
life.
Yeah.
Kill
a
few,
save
a
lot.
So,
what
happened
here?
Dr.
Isaacs
returned
in
an
infected
...that
had
been
treated
A
serum
derived
from
your
blood.
The
resulting
infection
My
blood?
Your
blood
has
bonded
Dr.
Isaacs
correctly
deduced...
...that
it
could
be
used
You
mean
my
blood
Correct.
So
why
are
you
helping
me?
Your
blood
is
pure,
...all
of
the
equipment
you
will
require
-
You
mean
this
could
all
end?
There
is,
however...
...a
small
problem.
I
have
him
contained
...
but
I
cannot
hold
him
there
All
right,
let's
go.
Alice?
Good
luck.
You
can't
kill
me.
I've
told
you...
...I
can't
die.
No.
For
so
long,
I
thought
I
was
wrong.
I
am
the
future.
No.
You're
just...
...another
asshole.
And
we're
both
goanna
die
Yeah,
you're
the
future,
all
right.
All
attempts
to
contact
the
North
How
long
have
they
been
off
the
air?
Seventeen
hours.
We
must
consider
them
lost.
All
data
will
be
transferred
...and
the
research
will
continue
I
expect
results
within
one
month.
You
won't
have
to
wait
that
long,
boys.
Because
I'm
coming
for
you.
And...
...l'm
goanna
be
bringing
You're
just...
...
another
asshole.
