Sir,
a
half-hour
ago,
with
some
of
our

How
many

we
lost?
And
you
waited

to

Stop.

ALICE:
It's
okay.
Sorry
about
that.
But
I
had
to
get
this
thing
off
of
you.
What
is
this?
Who
did
this
to
you?
Do
you
even
know
who
I
am?
My
name
is
Alice.
We
met
in
the

18
months
ago.
Any
of

familiar?
Mikey,

left

I
will
pass

After
that,
it's

Whatever
that
thing
was,
it
was
injecting

Something
that

I
just
hope
the
effects
aren't
permanent.
CLAIRE:
is
Alice,
right?
ALICE:
Look,
I
am
sorry
about
back
there.
I
don't
know
what
happened.
I
don't
remember
anything.
I
don't
even
know
my
name.
It's
Claire.
Claire

Claire?
Sound
familiar?
Not
really.
You
will
get
used
to

Perhaps
you
can

loose
now.

about

Oh,
my
God.
CLAIRE:
Look
over
there.
Damn.

BENNETT:
It's
a
plane.
I
knew
it.
I
told
you
they
would
come.

No
way
we're
getting
in
there.
Where
is
he
going?
Why
is
he
flying
away?
It's
not
flying
away.
It's
circling.
Circling?
Damn,
he's
low.
Down.
What
the
hell
is
he
doing?
He's
going
to

He's
going

Land?
Land.
That
is
one
crazy
son
of

bitch.

This
may
get
a
little
rough.
Then
cut
me
loose.
Thanks.
Just
don't
do
anything
crazy,
all
right?
Nothing
as
crazy
Come
on,
Kim,
move
it.
Well,
try.
All
right,
hold
on.
Hurry,
he's
coming.
Come
on.



Come

it.
Come
on.
LUTHER:
Good
work.
That's
it.
Good
job.

Nice

That's

Luther

A
pleasure
Hi,
my
name's
Crystal.
Enough
with
the
introductions.
Can
you
get
us
out?
What
did
you
say?
What
do
you
know
about
Arcadia?
CRYSTAL:
There
are
survivors.
Infection
free.
So
they
sent
you,
right?
No.
But
there
are
others
out
there
like
you?
It's
just
us.
There's
to
be
no
rescue?
I
am
sorry.

Sorry.
They
had
their
hopes
up
and...
Thought
you
could
take
them
Angel
Ortiz.
That
was
some
fine
flying.
Thanks.
What's
the
prognosis?
Yeah.
You
know,
I
have
the
strangest
feeling
I
know
you.

Yeah,
I
get
that
a
lot.
You're
a
sports
fan,
huh?
Do
you
like
basketball?
Not
really.
No?
Oh.
Well,
maybe
just
a
fan
of
fine
timepieces.
Yeah.
Luther
here
is
our
resident
superstar.
So
tell
me
about
Arcadia.
What
exactly
do
you
know?
Just
from
their
transmissions.
We
have
been
receiving
Food
and
shelter,
safety
We
thought
they
sent
you.
We
have
been
launching

Flares?
Who's
going
to
see
flares
from
Alaska?
Alaska?
Arcadia.
I
have
been
there.
It's
in
Alaska.
A
town?
I
don't
think
so.
Take
a
look.
At
what?
ANGEL:
It's
not
a
town.
It's
a
ship.
ANGEL:

What
is
that?
I
don't
know.
That
was
the
last
we
heard
from
them.
Then
it
just
stopped.
That
was
two
days
ago.
We
have
been
sending
up
flares
So
when
you
arrived,
of
course,
ALICE:
That
ship
over
there.
That's
Arcadia.
I
know.
You
remember?
People
were
coming
to
help
us.
What
happened?
I
don't
know.
I
can't
remember.
ALICE
:
We
have
to
get
to
that
ship.




Welcome
to
your
new
home,
Crystal's
our
cook.
The
menu's
not
extensive,
but
she
is
a
master
of
what
she
does.
Sorry
I
didn't
bring
better
news.
Get
used
to
disappointment,
right?
That's
what
my
agent
used
to
say.
Were
you
an
actress?
I
came
to
Hollywood,
Why
are
we
waiting?
Excuse
Get
out
of

man.
I
met

of
creeps

in
the

he
was

used
to
intern
for
him.
Still
That
plane,

can
fly,
but
it
only

two.
So
take
us
to
Arcadia
one
at
a
time.
Look,
I
think
she
was
lucky
Five
or
six
times
would
be
suicide.
No
offence.
None
taken.
There
has
to
be
another
way
out.
We
have
to
get
to
that
ship.
Well,
there
is
the--

What?
Nothing.
Look,
it
would
be
a
waste
of

time.
I
have
time
to
waste.

The

chance
By
the
time
we
got
here,
the
guards
I
guess
when
people
there
wasn't
much
point
We
thought
the
place
was
abandoned,
until
we
made
a
discovery.
Wendell,
time
to
take
a
break.
It's
about
god-damn
time.
I
am
hearing
movement
in
the
walls.
So
let's
check
it
out.
I
will
be
back
in
a
minute.
Come
on.

Name's
Chris.
You
were
the
one
flying
that
plane.
How
do
you
know
that?
Wendell
isn't
the
only
one
that
hears
things.
I
am
glad
you
made
it.
Maybe
you
can
talk
some
sense
What
do
you
mean?
Isn't
it
obvious?
I
am
not
a
prisoner.
I
shouldn't
be
in
here.
CHRIS:
We
were
using
this
place
as
a
staging
post.
Things
were
already
bad
when
the
order
We
needed
as
many
people
on
the
streets
And
it
was
chaos.
We
were
pulling
out
and
a
gang
I
guess
they
thought
I
was
a
guard.
I
woke
up,
my
unit
was
gone.
I
was
in
here.
Their
idea
of
a
joke.
You
don't
believe
me.
Do
the
others?
You
need
to
get
me
out
of
here.
We're
all
trapped
here.
But
I
can
help
you.
LUTHER:
ALICE:
You
find
anything?
CHRIS:
If
you
get
me
out
of
here,
You're
going
to
need
me.
Have
you
checked
His
way
out?
He's
not
telling
us

till
we
let
The
man
is
a
killer.
Really?
How
can
you
be
so
sure?
I
know

Interesting.
What
do
you
see
LUTHER:
Holy
shit.
Girl's
got
to
be
prepared.
What
would
you
possibly
want
with
those?
It's
a
hobby.
A
hobby?
All
right.
Well,
I
will
see
you
in
the
morning.

CLAIRE:
Your
friends
are
out
there?
I
think
so.
You
don't
remember?
It's
coming
back.
Slowly.
Nothing
that
makes
any
sense.






LUTHER:
ALICE:
We
do
our
best.
It's
cold.
Our
best
only
goes
so
far.
These
are
for
you.
I
guess
I
should
leave
you
to
it.
I
guess
you
should.
I
will
be
right
outside.
Thank
you.

Luther?

Take
it
easy,
honey.
Move
it.
Okay,
I
am
just
going
to

take
it
easy.

BENNETT:
Must
have
burrowed
up
from
the
sewers.
LUTHER:
What?
So
these
things
We
got
to
get
out
of
this
place.
Arcadia
will
send
help.
No
one's
coming
to
get
us.
We
have
to
help
ourselves.
This
plane
that
you
have.
Well,
we
can
draw
straws.
We
all
get
out
of
here
Great.
How
are
we
going
to
do
that?
Walk
out
of

BENNETT:
They
didn't
want
him
getting
out.
Angel,
what
do
you
think?
I
think
we
don't
have
much
of
a
choice.
This
is
insane.
Crystal,
Crystal,
look
I
mean,
not
even
you're
that
dumb.
If
this
guy
thinks
he
knows
All
right.
BENNETT:
This
is
a
mistake.
This
is
a
big
mistake.
I
was
wondering
Boo.
all
right,
Claire?
What?
Claire,
it's
me.
It's
Chris.
I
don't
know
you.
CHRIS:
I
am
your
brother,
remember?
What
the
hell's
happened
to
you?
It's
okay.
Let
him
go.
Look,
she
suffered
If
you
really
are
her
brother,
it
will
come
back.
All
right,
this
is
very
touching.

on,

Let's
go.


ALICE:


Nice.

ANGEL:

There
must
be
We
can't
go
back
that
way.
Oh,
shit.
What--?
What
do
you
think
it
is?
Don't
tell
me
that
thing
Can
you
put
this
back
together?
Maybe,
but
it
could
take
a
week.
What
do
we
do
now?
I
know.
Bennett,
what
have
you
done?
Luther,

ALICE:
Come
on,
baby.
Come
on.
What
are
we
doing?
But
the
others.
Now,
get
on-board.
LUTHER:
CLAIRE:
Hey.
Open
this
door.
Bennett,
please.
LUTHER:
Oh,
shit.
That's
right,
bitch.
Fuck
you.
Yes.
Yes.
Son
of
a
bitch.
I
am
sorry.
He's
headed
for
the
Arcadia.

Alice.

Come
on.
Head
for
the

block.
Move.
This
thing
has
no
power.
We
won't
need
power.
Oh,
shit.
Hold
on.
LUTHER:
Hey,
head
to

Over
here.

Are
you
all
right?
This
is
some
kind
of
joke,
right?
The
tunnels
lead
to
the
sewers,
This
storm
drain
leads
to
the
sea.
It's
our
only
chance.
LUTHER:
Ladies.
All
right,
you're
next.
I
can't
do
it.
Let's
go.




CLAIRE:
Aah.

We
found
a
way
out
just
down
there.
Go.
Be
careful.
Where's
Kim
Yong?
Go.
Go.
I
knew
you'd
make
it.
Luther.
LUTHER:
Luther.
You
can't
help
him
now.
We
have
to
move
on.

No
welcome
party,
It
looks
like
Bennett
made
it.
Let's
check
inside.
Did
you
find
anyone?
CHRIS:
I
checked
the
crew
Looks
like
they
left
in
a
hurry.
MAN
:
This
is
Arcadia,
There
is

Look
at

It's
the

log.
The

when

stopped.
CHRIS:
But
it
says
there
are

have
to
search

Of
course.
I
remember
them
coming
for
us.
This
whole
thing,
Arcadia,
was
a
lie.
No,
it's
worse
than
that.
It's
a
trap.
Where
is
everybody?
I
don't
understand.
I
think
I
do.
They're
underneath
our
feet.
CLAIRE:
They're
holding
Look.
It's
K-Mart.
She's
here.
ALICE:
All
of
them.

CLAIRE:
K-Mart.
Get
her
out.

K-Mart,
it's
okay.
K-Mart,
it's
all
right.
I
will
get
this
off
her.
We're
your
friends.
Let
me
get
this
off
you.


Why
am
I
not
surprised?
You
weren't
too
hard
to
find.
Our
satellite
system
is
still
operational.
And
there
aren't
too
many
people
And
besides,
I
always
knew
Loyalty,
highly
overrated.

Stop.
Down.
Wouldn't
want
you
harming
my
pets.
Drop
your
guns.
Thank
you.
Good.
You
don't
look
so
good,
Bennett.
Yeah,
I
am
looking
forward
What
do
you
want
from
me?
The
T-Virus
brought
me
back.
But
it's
so
strong.
It
fights
me
for
control.
I
thought
if
I
ingested
fresh
human
DNA,
I
could
redress
the
balance.
No
wonder
your

abandoned

WESKER:
Now
I
have
a
