Man:
I
was
dead.
Where's
my
garden?
I
can't
smell
anything.
I
hate
this
place.
How
did
I
get
here?
Pop.
Dad.
It's
Michael.
As
you
are...
I
was.
As
I
am...
you
will
be.


Mike's
voice:
Maybe
I'm
just
an
incredibly
vivid
lucid
nightmare.
When
is
the
last
time

I
flew
in
yesterday.
Or
was
that...
today?
I
can't
remember.
Was
I
on
a
train?
I
woke
up
somewhere
and
I
had
breakfast.
Where
was
I?

Here
it
comes.
They
say
you
can't
die
Is
that
true?


The
shock

So

four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight...

Nine,

Okay.
If
something
should
happen,
I
want
it
to
be
known
The
room...
did
not
win.
Okay.
Okay,
I
can
do
this.
18
little
steps.
Four...
Don't
look
down.
Keep
moving.
Here

go.
All
right.
Number

Woman:
Lily:

No.
No.
Doctors

Mike:
What

Katie:

Give
me
a
signal.
-

Oh,
yes!
-

Mike,
is
that...
-
I
can
barely
see
you.
-
It's
like
seeing
a
ghost.
-
It's
me.
It's
Mike.
I
mean,
I
haven't
talked
and
suddenly
you
pop
up
I'm
sorry,
Lily.
Look,
I'm
at
work,
okay?
So
why
don't
I'm
trapped
in
this
room,
Mike,
you're
always
trapped
in
weird

Lily.
Listen
to
me.

I'll
be
right
down.
Lily,
please!

You're
in
the
city?
-
2254
Lexington.
I'll
tell
you
later.
-
That's
just
perfect.
You
walk
out,
you
disappear.
Not
divorced.
Separated?
-
Suddenly
you
need
me?
-
I'm
in
danger.
You
understand?
You're
not
making
There's
something
trying
No,
Lily!
No
no
no!

I've
got
a
knife!


Or
that
way.
All
right,

Lady,
let
me
in!
-
Help!
Help!
-
Lady,
I'm
coming
through!
Mike,
can
you
help
me?
Mike:
I
got
to
get
some
cigarettes.
Jesus
Christ!
Mike:
Mike,
you
can't
do
this.
She
needs
you.
You've
got
an
amazing
talent
You
think
I'm
trying
to
talk
-
Don't
put
your
hands
on
me,
old
man!
Talk?
Why
change
what
appears
to
be
You
were
always
great
but
the
problem
is
I
never
gave
a
shit
Shit!
Hello!
Oh.
Kevin
O'Malley.

No.
No
no
no
no
no
no.
I
can't
help
you.
I
can't
help
you.
No!

It's
good
to
be
back.
That's
enough
of
that.
Alcohol.
I
was
just
checking
to
see
are
exceeding
You
know
goddamn
well
-
What
do
you
want
from
me?
What
do
you
want?
What
do
you
want,

You
sought
this
room.
-
I
beg
your
pardon?
Oh,
that's
right.
You
like

Oh,
that's
bullshit!
Why
do
you

It's
the
prospect
How

be
yours.
Are

Hey,
you're
not
You're
gonna
stay

everyone
dies.
When
they're
old.
When
they're
much
older.
Okay,
and
then
they
go
And
it's
beautiful
there.
And
all
your
friends
Is
God
there?
Yes.
Do
you
really
Yes.
Mike:
You
know
what
I
think!
-
We
did
everything
we
could!
-
We
should
have
helped
her
fight...
...instead
of
filling
her
head
full
about
heavens
and
all
that
bullshit!
Those
stories,
I'm
going
to
get

voice:
I'm
trying
to

bathed
in
tango
light,
the
kind
of
light

out
of
their
graves
Now
this
is
level
nine...

the
deepest
level
of
hell,
furthest
removed
This
is

It's
goddamn
five.
I
think
I
see
Yes,
I
can
see
Lily:
Mike,
can
you
hear
me?
-
Michael,
where
the
hell
are
you?
Michael?
-
Mike.

Lily.
Oh
my
God.
Thank
God.
-
Did
you
call
the
cops?
-
Didn't
you
say
the
Dolphin?
-
You're
sure?
Mike,
they're
in
1408.
The
room's
empty.
Mike?
Michael,
-

Michael,
I'm
afraid
I
can't
express
Calm
down,
okay?
-
Don't
panic.
Michael,
stop
it!
Don't
move.
Mike?
15
minutes
-
It'll
be
too
late.
-
Lily.
Actually,
15
minutes
It's
perfect.
-
Good,
yes.
You've
always
been
someone
I
know
we
haven't
talked
a
lot
-
but
I
need
you,
sweetie.
I
can't
explain
it
here.
You
just
have
I
miss
you
too,
but...
When
you
get
here,
Just
come
straight
up
to
the
14th
floor.
-
Walk
through
the
door.
-
It's
life
or
death,
sweetie.
-
Okay.
-
I
need
to
talk
to
you
about
Katie.
-
Lily,
don't
listen
to
him!
-
It's
a
trick!
Don't
come
up
here!

Lily!

Kafkaesque
hotel,
the
Dolphin.

I
spoke
with
you
there.

I
called
you.
You're
gonna
be
okay.
Oh,
we
have
a
winner.
600
bucks.
Unbelievable.
I
can
see
why
Why
did
you
leave?
Because
every
time
I
saw
her
face.
Lily:
I
think
in
the
dream
and
it
brought
up
That's
a
good
thing
But
this
was...
I
mean,
I
was
down
I
was
rattled.
And
I
can't
shake
it.
you
should
drive
me
-
check
me
into
the
psych
unit.
You
look
really
great.
I
can't
believe
Tell
me
about
it.

was
there.
Mmm-hm.
Can
you
imagine
what
it
feels
like
I

the
very
that
I
talked
to
her,
I
talked
to
her,
Yeah.
I
see
her
every
night
Yeah,
but
it
was
so
vivid.
It
was
so
real.
Maybe
you
should

Katie?
-
You
always
were
tougher
than
me.
Seriously,

sounds
like
Can
you
stay?
I'm
sorry.
Okay,

have
got

gonna
be
Uh-huh.
So

the
way,
What
is
it?
That's
some
scary
shit.
See
you
around.
Did
I
drop
a
postcard?
-
What?
-
Huh?
No,
I
think
I
would
But
if
I
find
it,
Okay?
Mike:
My
experience
in
the
room

fragmented
loop

was
a
horrible
dream,
yet
somehow

You're
scaring

so.
I
know
I
haven't
been
but
I
just
wanted
to...
come
by
and
see
tell
you
I
was
doing
okay.
Doing
pretty
good,
actually.
I
started
talking
And
I
wrote
a
new
book,
which
I
actually
think
believe
it
or
not.

Michael.
Dad.
Michael.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So...

Man:
