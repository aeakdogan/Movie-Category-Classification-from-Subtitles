Thank
you.
Last
place
of
employment?
Denver,
Colorado.
Worked
there
for
ten
years.
Then
things
just
seemed
to
dry
up.
They
lost
fourteen
banks
in
one
week.
So,
well...
There's
nothing
available

They
use
The
venom
of
snakes
is
Their
mouths
are
full
And
in
their
paths,
And
the
fear
of
God
is
not
They
have
taken
the
hearts
They
have
recruited
And
they
have
blinded
us
to
the
truth.
Our
human
spirit
is
corrupted.
Why
do
we
worship
greed?
Because
outside
feeding
off
us,
from
birth
to
death
They
have
us!
They
control
us!
They
are
our
masters!
Wake
up,
they're
all
about
you.
All
around
you.

Sometimes,
when
I
watch
TV,
I
stop
being
myself.
I'm
a
star
of
a
series
or
a--
or
I
have
my
own
talk
show
or
I'm
on
the
news
going
some
place
important.
All
I
ever
have
to
do
is
be
famous.
People
watch
me
and
they
love
me.
And
I
never,
never
grow
old.
And
I
never
die.
Excuse
me.
You
need
anybody?
Maybe.
I
got
my
own
tools.
Well,
this
is
a
union
job.
So,
then
may
I
please
speak
Sir?
Hey,
there's
no
sleeping
So
you
park
your
ass
Excuse
me.
Then
when
do
I
get
paid?
Thursday.
You
need
a
place
to
stay?
Justiceville's
over
on
Fourth
Street.
They
got
hot
food
and
showers.
I'm
going
that
way
I
don't
like
nobody
following
me
Well,
I
don't
join
up
with
anybody
until
I
see
where
he's
going.
They're
serving
the
food
up
soon.
Good,
I'm
starving.
Whoa.
Hey,
throw
the
ball.
Hey,
Frank,
how's
it
going?
Now

a
chance
to
meet
This

Gilbert.
Anything
you
need,
Hi.
Howdy.
What

you
got
in
that
pack,
tools?
Yes,
sir.
Well,

you
can
use
them
Shower's

Let's
get
something
to
eat.
There

Want
some
peas?
-
Thanks.
Yes.
Peas?
I
got
a
wife
and
two
kids
Haven't
seen
them
in
six
months.
Steel

They
finally
went

We

Know
what
they
gave
themselves?
Raises.
The

They

more
factory,

should
take
a
sledge
to

You
know,
you
ought
to

Yeah,
well
I'm
all
out.
The
whole
deal
is
like
They

Only,
everyone's
out
for
themselves
and
looking
to
do
you
in
Okay,
man,
here
we
are.
Here
we
are--
But
remember,
to
blow
your
ass
away.
So,
how
you
going
to
make
it?
I
deliver
a
hard
day's
work
I
just
want
the
chance,
I
believe
in
America.
I

Our

are
being

We

Goddamn
hacker,
that's
the
second
time
The
movement
was
begun
by
a
small
group
of
scientists
these

sent
through--
Thing's
giving
me
a
headache.
Yeah,
tell
me
about
it.
Must
took
the
hacker's
months
The
poor
and
the
underclass
Racial
justice
and
human
rights
They
have
created
and
we
are
their
unwitting
accomplices.
Their
intention
to
rule
rests
with
the
annihilation
We
have
been
lulled
into
a
trance.
They
have
made
us
We
are
focused
only
on
our
own
gain.
We
ha--
Please
understand,
they
are
safe
That
is
their
primary
Keep
us

Blow

Oh,

Until
four
in
the
morning?
Hey,
we're
taking
care
They
are
dismantling
More
and
more
people
are
becoming
poor.
We
are
their
cattle.
We
are
being
bred
for
slavery.
The
revo--
Not
again.
We
cannot
break
their
signal.
Our
transmitter
is
not
powerful
enough.
The
signal
must
be
shut
off
We
have--
Danny,
I
have
a
headache.
Me
too,
honey.
Can
somebody
please
explain
to
me
Just
that
idiot
licking
his
nuts
again.


I
just
checked
the
connection
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.

We
have
to
face
facts.
Only
a
few
seconds
got
on
the
air.
It's
time
to
forget
about
breaking
in
They're
only
going
to
jam
us
out
Then
we
have
to
send
No,
no,
no,
that's
not
We've
been
all
through
this.
We
have
no
other
choice.
Robbing
banks,
until
we're
blue
in
the
face.
We're
just
not
going
to
reach
We've
got
to
find
new
people,
That's
my
baby.
Just
leaving--
Just
wanted
to
close
it--
Neighborhood
watch.
Yeah,
well,
let
me
touch
your
face.
-
Mmm,
it's
good.
Now
your
hands.
-
That's
fine.
-
Eh,
you're
a
working
man.
Here,
it's
the
revolution.
Let
me
show
you.
I
got
to
be
going
right
now.
Maybe
some
other
time,
huh?
Huh?
This
world
may
have
blinded
me,
but
the
Lord
has
let
me
see.
You'll
be
back.
You'll
be
back!
I've
been
hearing
something
the
last
couple
of
weeks.
Weird
stuff.
Some
sort
of
epidemic
of
violence
what
they've
been
saying.
I
was
talking
to
one
old
boy,
he's
from
San
Anselmo.
He
told
me
they
got
End
of
the
world
kind
of
stuff.
Well,
what
are
they
doing?
You
know,
shooting
people,
Same
old
thing
as
always.
Whole
lot
of
people
gone
crazy
You
want
to
know
the
truth?
This
kind
of
shit
happens
It
does--
it's
just
people
It's
all
it
is.
Hey,
what's
happening?
I
was
inside
there
a
while.
All
kinds
of
cardboard
boxes,
What
do
you
mean?
There's
no
singing.
It's
a
tape
recorder.
Leave
it
alone,
man.
It
ain't
none
of
my
business,
ain't
none
of
yours.
Yeah,
but
our
boy,
Gilbert's
Look,
I
got
a
job
now.
And
I
plan
on
keeping
it.
I'm
walking
a
white
line
all
the
time.
I
don't
bother
nobody,
You
better
start
doing
the
same.
White
line's
in
the
middle
of
the
road.
It's
the
worst
place
to
drive.
I'll
see
you
later.
Step
down.
Watch
it.
Easy,
easy,
this
way.
All
right,
now
we're
going
It's
dirt
here.

Quickly,
quickly!
-
Go,
go!
Frank!
We
know
who
you
are.
Leave
us
alone!
We
know
you!
Don't
hurt
him
either.
God
help
me!
Though
I
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death,
Thy
rod
and
Thy
staff
will--
Jesus!
Jesus!

Come
on!
Come
on
in
and
join
the
party,
man.
You
go
with
them.


Somebody

Oman's

Dash
and

are
back.
Out
goes

The

Gay
abandon
rushes
to
meet
the
roaring
'90s.
What's
your
problem?
I
said,
what's
your
problem?
How
are
you
today,
sir?
-
Okay,
how's
it
going?
Thank
you,
sir.
Here
you
are,
sir.
Hey,
buddy,
you
going
to
pay
for
that
or
what?
Look,
buddy,
Either
pay
for
it
or
put
it
back.
Huh.

Can
you
believe
it?
She
didn't
even
go
to
Lamaze
class.
I
told
her,
go!
Did
Bob
make
you
go
I
was
shocked,
It's
so
dated.

So
depressed,
Hey,
go
for
it,
man.
It's
easy
for
you
to
say,
Look,
it'll
come,
all
right?
The
feeling
is
definitely
there.
It's
a
new
morning
in
America--
fresh,
vital.
The
old
cynicism
is
gone.
We
have
faith
in
our
leaders.
We're
optimistic
It
really
boils
down
We
don't
need
pessimism.
There
are
no
limits.
It
figures
it
would
be
Uh.
Excuse
me.
You
know,
you
look
like
your
head
back
in
1957.
You,
you're
okay.
This
one,
real
fucking
ugly.
Oh.
You
see,
I
take
these
glasses
off,
she
looks
like
a
regular
person,
Put
them
back
on,
formaldehyde
face--
That's
enough
out
of
you.
Get
out
or
I
call
the
cops.
Call
the
cops,
You
need
a
Brazilian
I've
got
one
that
can
see.

He's
a
tall
Caucasian
male,
doesn't
appear
armed,
I
don't
like
this
one
bit.
Not
one
bit.

That's
like
pouring
perfume
on
a
pig.
All
right,
suppose
we
settle
down?
That's
far
enough.
Where'd
you
get
those
glasses?
Tooth
fairy.
I'll
bet.
We
got
him.
Nick
yourself
shaving
this
morning?
You
look
as
shitty
to
us
Impossible.
It
would
be
easier
if
we
don't
have
Just
take
it
easy.
Now,
you
stumbled
onto
something
here.
Maybe
we
can
all
benefit
Now,
let's
go
someplace
quiet
so
we
can
talk
this
over.
So
you
bastards
die


I
have
come
here
and
kick
ass.
And
I'm
all
out
of
bubble
gum.
Near
the
entrance.
Has
a
shotgun.
White
male,
30s,
long
hair.
Mama
don't
like
tattletales.
Wearing
sunglasses.
And
who
are
you,
little
fella?
Come
to
show
them
where
I
am.
Not
nice.
Drop
it!
I
said
drop
it!
Beat
your
feet.

Take
it
easy.
Just
want
a
little
ride
out
of
here.
Close
the
door.
Drive.
Not
too
fast.
They're
gone.
Just
keep
driving.
Where
am
I
going?
You
married?
Yes.
Please
don't
lie
to
me.
No.
Live
alone?

I'd
rather
not
do
that.
I'm
afraid
I
must
insist.

Hi,
Holly.
Hmph.
Look,
I
don't
know
what
you
want.
Oh,
just
quiet.
Whoo.
It's
like
a
drug.
Wearing
these
glasses
makes
you
high,
Now
look,
things
turned
out
You're
not
the
only
one.
Yeah,
well,
I'm
sorry.
But
I
needed
you
to
get
away.
No,
you
have
two
guns.
You're
not
sorry.
You're
in
charge.
Look
lady,
we're
in
trouble.
The
whole
world's
in
trouble.
They're
all
around
us
You
can
only
see
them
I
swear
to
you
we're
being
controlled
I
don't
know
what
they
are
but
we
got
to
stop
them!
I'll
do
whatever
you
want
whenever
you
want.
Just
don't
hurt
me,
please.
Listen
to
what
I'm
saying
to
you.
Okay.
You're
fighting
the
forces
of
evil
that
none
of
us
can
see
Take
a
look.
If
you
want
me
to
look
I'll
look
through
your
sunglasses.
If
I
don't
see
what
you
see,
I'm
going
to
see
it
anyway.
Yeah,
you
have
it
your
way,
huh?
It's
not
my
way.
It's
your
way.
Don't
fuck
with
me.
I'm
thirsty.
Go
ahead.
Look,
uh,
I'm
sorry
I
have
to
be
here,
huh?

So,
your
name's
Holly,
right?
Holly
Thompson.
It's
a
pretty
name.
So
what
do
you
do?
Assistant
program
director,
Cable
54.
A
TV
station?
Yes.
They're
sending
some
kind
No,
no.
I'm
all
right.
Holly
Thompson,
8634
Circleview
Drive.
Yes,
I'll
hold.

Frank,
we're
ready
when
you
are.
Frank.
Don't
let
nobody
see
you.
I've
had
a
rough
couple
of
days.
I
don't
want
nothing
to
do
with
you.
How
many
people
did
you
kill?
Not
people.
You
crazy
son
of
a
bitch!
-
I
got
to
show
you
something.
I
got
a
wife
and
kids.
So,
leave
me
alone.
Get
out
of
here.

Watch
this.
Oh,
no.
Yo.
One
week's
pay.
It's
the
best
I
could
do.
Wait!
Hey,
you
better
find
yourself
and
keep
praying
Try
these
on.
Look,
you
crazy
mother,
-
Put
these
on.
I'm
telling
you,
I'm
trying
to
save
you
You
couldn't
even
save
your
own.
I'm
giving
you
a
choice.
Either
put
on
these
glasses
or
start
eating
that
trash
can.
Not
this
year.
Okay.
All
right.
-
Okay.
Come
on.
I
don't
want
to
fight
you.
-
Come
on!
-
Stop
it!
Fuck!
Shit!
Put
on
the
glasses.
Man,
I
told
you,
I
didn't
want
to
be
in--
You
dirty
motherfucker.
Take
a
look.
Put
'em
on.
No!
Shit.
Oh,
man,
I'm
sorry,
man.
You
f--
Fuck!
Put
the
glasses
on!
Put
'em
on!
Fuck
you.
Look.
Look
at
them,
they're
everywhere.
Maybe
they
can
see.
Now
hold
on.
You
ain't
the
first
son
of
a
bitch

What's
that?
Brother,
life's
a
bitch.
And
she's
back
in
heat.

I
want
a
room.
Ain't
love
grand?
Don't
wear
them
glasses
too
long.
Starts
to
feel
like
a
knife
How
long
have
they
been
there?
Who
knows.
What
are
they,
Well,
they
ain't
from
Cleveland.
Look,
man,
I
don't
need
What
are
we
going
to
do?
We're
going
to
wait.
Wait
wait
for
what?
You
know,
that
really
answers
Well,
when
you
get
you
let
me
know,
huh?
We
can't
be
the
only
We
got
to
find
the
people
Yeah,
if
any
of
them
are
still
alive.
A
long
time
ago
things
were
different,
man.
My
own
daddy
kicked
my
ass,
told
me
I
was
saved.
He
changed
when
I
was
little.
Turned
mean.
Started
tearing
at
me.
So
I
ran
away
when
I
was
13.
Tried
to
cut
me,
once.
Big
old
razor
blade.
Held
it
up
against
my
throat.
I
said,
"Daddy,
please."
Just
kept
moving
back
and
forth.
Like
he
was
sawing
down
a
little
tree.
Maybe
they've
always
been
with
us.
Those
things
out
there.
Maybe
they
love
it.
Seeing
us
hate
each
other.
Watching
us
kill
each
other
off.
Feeding
on
our
own
I
got
news
for
'em.
Going
to
be
hell
to
pay.
Because
I
ain't
Frank?
There's
a
meeting
tonight.
Be
at
this
address
at
11
o'clock.
Watch
out
no
one
follows
you.

World
needs
a
wake-up
call.
We're
going
to
phone
it
in.
Hey,
brothers.
There's
something
new
going
down.
They're
using
candy
floss
packages.
It's
like
building
a
park
They
colorized
it.
Here's
a
list
of
safe
houses.
You're
going
to
memorize
it
What's
a
safe
house?
What
kind
of
gun
is
that?
Hey,
Frank.
-
Hey.
Oh,
you
can
take
your
sunglasses
off.
We're
all
human
in
here.
Memorize
these
safe
houses.
Brand
new.
Got
the
first
shipment
today.
They
won't
hurt.
There's
less
interference.
Go
ahead.
There
is
a
signal
broadcast
through
our
television
sets.
Even
when
the
set
is
turned
off.
-
The
brain
receives
the
input...
-
Hi.
No,
we
made
it
fine.
Good,
the
city's
crawling
with
cops
And
most
of
the
cops
are
human.
They've
been
told
that
we're
commies
And
some
of
them
are
being
recruited.
Creatures
are
trading
wealth,
power.
You
mean
people
Most
of
us
just
sell
out
right
away.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
we
get
promoted.
Our
bank
accounts
get
bigger.
We
start
buying
new
houses,
cars.
Perfect,
isn't
it?
We'll
do
anything
to
be
rich.
Look
around
the
environment
we
live
in.
Carbon
dioxide,
fluorocarbons,
have
increased
since
1958.
Earth
is
being
acclimatized.
They
are
turning
our
atmosphere
What
do
these
things
want
It's
in
our
best
interests.
They're
free
enterprisers.
The
Earth
is
just
another
Their
third
world.
We
are
like
a
natural
resource
deplete
the
planet,
They
want
benign
indifference.
They
want
us
drugged.
We
could
be
pets.
We
could
be
food.
But
all
we
really
are
is
livestock.
Now,
we
need
an
assault
unit.
Someone
to
hit
them
hard
You've
got
it.
Ever
see
their
disappearing
act?
Once.
What's
that?
They
all
wear
these
expensive
watches.
Turns
out
they're
really
You
can
listen
to
their
broadcast.
There's
something
else.
Some
kind
of
secret
code
They
push
a
button
They're
gone.
I've
been
trying
to
figure
it
out.
All
right,
now
everybody
listen
up.
Now,
we're
obviously
not
getting
because
look
at
our
numbers
tonight.
There
should
be
twice
We're
getting
too
sloppy,
Now,
their
detection
is
becoming
more
effective.
So
we
have
to
be
more
careful.
Stay
aware
of
keeping
up
appearances.
Go
to
work,
punch
your
time
clocks.
Do
what's
expected
of
you.
We've
gotten
reckless.
And
the
movement's
suffering
for
it.
Time
to
stop
talking
about
it
trying
to
figure
out
how
it
happened.
Now
we
start
spilling
some
blood!

Wait
a
minute,
it's
not
working!
We
don't
stand
a
chance
So
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
We
bide
our
time.
We
seek
out
and
locate
their
signal
Wake
people
up!
Now,
Dave
here
works
at
KRDA.
He
claims
that
the
signal
KRDA
is
clear.
The
transmission
is
going
out
clean.
The
signal
is
coming
How
does
she
know?

All
right,
this
is
the
point.
It's
important
to
find
out
exactly
And
the
only
way
we
can
do--
I
got
to
go
talk
to
someone.
If
you're
approached
by
anyone
by
all
means
accept.
Gain
their
trust.
Make
them
believe
Are
you
okay?
Yeah,
I'm
okay.
I
thought
I'd
killed
you.
I
thought
so
too.
I
didn't
know.
I'm
so
sorry.
Look,
I
just
want
to--
Can
we
just--
Get
out!


-
They're
killing
everybody.
-
Wait
a
minute,
man,
are
you
crazy?
Just
stay
back!
There's
nothing
you
can
do
out
there.
If
I
can
get
this
thing
working,
-
Frank,
-
Frank,
-
Get
set
to
shoot.

-
What
was
that?

Attention,
This
entryway
is
temporary
-
Get
in
there.
-
Move.
-
Now!

Six
seconds.
Five
seconds.
Four
seconds.
Three
seconds.
Two
seconds.
One
second.

If
you
need
assistance
bilingual
instructions
are
posted
What
language
is
that?
I
don't
know.
Where
the
hell
are
we?
I
think
we're
under
the
city.
Maybe
some
kind
There
got
to
be
a
way
out.
I
just
hope
that
nobody

Right.

We
have
eliminated
the
terrorists.
We
got
'em,
we
wiped
them
out!
It's
a
win,
man.
They
got
to
meet
the
A-team.

I'm
hearing
something.

Our
projections
show
not
only
America,
will
be
under

protection
of
this

alliance.
The
gains
have
been
substantial,
both
for
ourselves
and
for
you,
the

You
have
given
us
entrée
in
our
ongoing
quest

in
return,

I've
just
received

on

Coast.
We
are
off

alert.
The
situation
is
normal
again.

How
you
doing
boys?
I
didn't
know
you'd
been
recruited.
Welcome
aboard.
You
know
you
boys
really
now
you
can
afford
it.
I
got
to
tell
you,
You
seen
the
whole
place?
I
haven't
had
a
chance
to
yet.
Come
on,
I'll
show
you
around.
You
know,
I
knew
me
and
you
first
time
we
met.

Money
isn't
-
Hey,
waiter,
Thank
you,
buddy.
Excuse
me,
where
the
hell
are
we?
Back
stage
at
the
show,
boys.
I'll
admit
it
is
a
little
funky,
but
it
serves
its
purpose.
How
did
you
get
here,
I
know
we
ain't
supposed
to
use
'em
except
in
cases
of
emergency,
but
they're
so
much
fun.
Now,
you
think
that's
something?
Take
a
look
at
this.
Go
on,
take
a
closer
look.

you
want
to.
You
see,
the
whole
thing
works
Boys,
let
me
tell
you,
they
got
their
act
together.
Believe
you
me.
Evening,
boys.
Looking
sharp.
Wait
until
you
see
what
And
here
we
got
the
brains
That's
where
the
signal
goes
out
We
bump
it
out
all
over
the
world.
Pretty
fancy,
huh?
Not
too
familiar
with
it
myself.
Well,
boys,
as
far
as
we
go.
A
technique
called
This
would
allow
space
sensors
to
penetrate
natural
barriers
Can
you
get
us
inside?
I've
never
seen
the
inside
You
look
like
the
gentleman
to
ask.
Well,
I
guess
it
wouldn't
be
You
see
them
boys
over
there?
Friends
of
mine.
Hey,
fellas,
I
got
a
couple
Thought
I'd
give
them
the
grand
tour.
Think
we
can
go
inside?
Be
serious.
You
have
your
authorization
cards?
Right
here.
Watch
the
door.

Soundproof.
-
Where's
that
signal?
Holly
works
in
there.
If
she
made
it,
Then
we
can
go
to
the
roof
Wait
boys,
wait
You
made
the
mistake.
No,
no,
you
got
to
listen
to
me.
I
thought
you
boys
understood.
It's
business,
that's
all
it
is.
You
still
don't
get
it,
do
you
boys?
There
ain't
no
countries
anymore.
No
more
good
guys.
They're
running
the
whole
show.
They
own
everything--
They
can
do
whatever
they
want.
What's
wrong
with
having
it
good,
And
they're
going
to
let
us
They're
going
to
leave
us
alone.
Let
us
make
some
money.
You
can
have
a
little
taste
Now
I
know
you
want
it--
You
do
it
to
your
own
kind.
What's
the
threat?
We
all
sell
out
every
day.
Might
as
well
be
on
the
winning
team.
See
you,
boys.
Let's
go!
Is
this
the
two
minute
break
I
think
it's
the
thirty
second
break.
They
dropped
12,
I
think
so.
We
are
experiencing
What
the
hell's
going
on?
Come
on.

Get
down!

Now
what?
Find
out
where
the
hell
we
are.
Excuse
me.
-
Come
on,
man.
Do
you
know
Holly
Thompson?
Come
on,
man,
I
mean
it.
Holly

Where
is
she?

Security

Who's
Holly?

Oh,
shit.
Well,
I
hate
to
interrupt
you
folks,
but
could
someone
please
guide
me
Security.
How
do
I
get
to
the
roof?
There's
an
elevator
through
there.
Turn
to
your
left,
Thank
you
very
much.
Well?
Well,
there's
got
to
be
more
than
Security

Lock
the
elevators
down.
They're
on
the
move.


I
hear
them
on
the
19th
floor
We
got
you.
We're
on
the
21st
Go,
up.
Holly!


Intruders
are
here--
Repeat.
Let's
go!

Frank,
you
and
Holly
clear?

Are
you?
Don't
do
it.
Don't
interfere,
Drop
your
weapon.
Stand
away
from

or
we
will
open
fire.
Come

What's
wrong?
All
the
sex
and
violence
on
the
screen
I'm
fed
up
with
it.
Filmmakers
like
George
Romero
have
to
show
some
restraint.
They're
simply--
You're
filled
with
lightning
You're
feeling

Nothing
can
stop
you

You're
moving
on.
Hey,

wrong,
