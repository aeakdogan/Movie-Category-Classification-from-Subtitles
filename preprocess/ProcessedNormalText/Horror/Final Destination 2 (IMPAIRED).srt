HOST:
...since
Volee
Air
Flight
180
...shortly
after
takeoff
from
JFK
Airport.
Itâ€™s
a
disaster
that's
affected
many.
None
more
so
than
...which
lost
40
students
But
it
was
the
events
after
the
crash...
...that
has
turned
this
tragic
story
The
survivors
who
managed
...died
soon
thereafter
in
a
series
Now,
to
some,
...but
to
others,
they're
an
indication
that
That's
the
contention
of
-Thank
you
for
joining
us
this
evening.
Ahem.
And
I
appreciate
you
using
Most
people
say
"supernatural.
"
They
think
I'm
talking
about
ghosts
HOST:
Well,
here's
your
chance
GUEST:
...I
believe
that
there
's
a
sort
of
force...
...uh,
an
unseen
malevolent
presence
And
it
determines
when
we
live
and
die.
And
some
people
call
this
force
the
devil.
You
know,
but
I
think
So
I
prefer
to
call
it
death
itself
HOST:
G
U
EST:
Every
day,
everywhere,
all
the
time.
And
that's
what
I
want
people
...that
death
has
this
grand
design
So
when
Alex
Browning
got
off
that
plane
...he
basically
screwed
up
death
's
plan.
And
that's
what
I'm
trying
HOST:
And
the
fact
that
all
of
the
survivors
GUEST:
Well,
it's
not
so
much
...but
it's
the
way
that
they
died.
I
mean,
there
were
so
many
weird,
seemingly
Lt
just
didn't
make
sense.
You
know,
that's
the
proof
HOST:
Wait,
that's
not
proof
l
mean,
...that
can't
be
proven
MALE
VOICE:
GUEST:
Yeah,
but
you
should
be
HOST:
What
happened
after
GUEST:
A
mere
coincidence
would
have
But
not
all
of
them
HOST:
Yes,
but
people
die
all
the
time,
Lt
forced
people
to
question
What
if
they
were
something
more?
-What
if
you
could
do
something
about
it?
Please,
are
you
listening
to
yourself?
You're
saying
we
should
be
on
guard
GUEST:
Exactly
it.
And
in
order
to
survive...
...the
only
way
to
survive
Because
in
the
end,
And
today
may
be
your
day
to
die.
Okay,
I'll
can

Oh,

makes
me
feel
a
lot
better.
-Okay.
Can
we
go
get
the
guys?
Go
on.
KIMBERLY:

EUGENE:
Listen,
I
know
you've
gone
over
all
this
...but
would
you
mind
telling
me
It
was
like
I
was
there.
I
knew
something
bad
was
gonna
happen
-I
just
felt
wrong,
just
like
....
Look,
I
know
this
sounds
crazy,
but
Kid
who
got
off
the
plane?
Well,
it
happened
a
year
ago
today.
My
premonition
was
just
like
his.
-What
are
you
talking
about?
You
must
have
read
about
the
kid
who
had
...so
he
got
his
buddies
off
the
plane...
...and
then
the
thing
blew
up
-Yeah.
So
a
month
goes
by,
right?
But
then
all
the
survivors
Because
when
your
number's
up,
You
know,
some
people
even
said
...hunting
each
one
down...
...until
they
were
all
dead.

Please.

Okay,
you
want
me
...that
this
is
happening
all
over
again?
I
don't
know
why
we're
even
here.
What
do
you
want
from
me?
But
if
I
was
never
meant
to
pull
over,
Which
means
death
Yeah,
like
what
if
we're
all
getting
that
I
think
you're
all

certifiable.
I
can't
believe
I've
been
listening
-Let's
go,
Tim.
Kimberly!
On,
baby.
-Are
you
okay?
Shh,
shh.
You
can
all
go
now.
It's
okay.
Could
I
ask
you
something?
Anything.
Did
Mom
ever
have
any,
I
don't
know,
What
do
you
mean?
Um
....
Like
visions
or
premonitions.
Sweetie,
are
you
sure
you're
okay?
Dad,
I
know
this
sounds
crazy,
I
don't

here

--Reach

To
recap
our
top
story...
...Route
23
was
backed
up
A
record-breaking
pileup
Emergency
crews
spent
hours
...hoping
to
recover
any
survivors
So
far,
police
are
refusing
...until
the
families
are
notified.
The
camera
of
a
highway
patrol
car
-A
semi
comes
careening
across
the
road...
...and
smashes
into
a
red
SUV.
-The
SUV
driver
was
beside
her
vehicle.
-The
quick
actions
of
a
trooper
saved
her
life.
He
pulled
her
back
at
the
last
second
-
The
passengers
inside
the
SUV
....
You
guys
see
that?
In
other
news,
a
freak
accident
-Friends
say
Evan
Lewis...
...was
on
top
of
the
world
But
in
e
tragic
turn
of
events,
...while
trying
to
escape
a
fire
He
managed
to
make
it
out
...but
somehow
the
ladder
Investigators
believe
Lewis

Come
in.
Hey,
buddy.
I
want
you
to
take
this
And
then
tomorrow
it's
off
to
the
dentist,
Now
get
some
rest.
-Mom.
You
think
those
guys
were
Yeah.
Some
people
just
need
some
rewiring,
Lights
out.
At
the
request
of
the
patient,
"Nail
files,
pencils,
pens,
safety
pins,
..."matches,
lighters,
belts,
belt
buckles,
...paper
clips,
watches,
money
clip,

You
have
a
cell
phone
on
you?
"--poisons,
pills,
medications."
Great.
And
let
me
see
your
nails.
Good.
Then
I
think
we're
all
done.
Wait.
Um--
Is
she
dangerous
or
something?
No,
honey.
She
expects
you
are.
WOMAN:
MAN:
Get
him
off
me.
Get
him
off
me.
How
long
are
they
gonna
keep
Depends
on
her,
I
guess.
-Clear
Rivers?
They
told
me
that
you
had
something
to
do
Look,
I
don't
know
how
to
explain
it...
...but
I
saw
the
pileup
And
I
saved
some
people.
And
now
you
think
death
is
after
you.
Nice
work.
Maybe
if
you're
real
lucky,
Anything
else?
One
person
died
in
an
accident
last
night.
Well,
if
you
put
them
on
the
list,
List?
What
list?
Death's
list.
The
survivors
of
Flight
180
...they
were
originally
meant
to
die
That
was
death's
original
design.
The
list.
I
was
supposed
to
die
in
that
crash
You
said
that
someone
else
That
means
someone
must
Officer
Burke
pulled
me
away
Congratulations.
You'll
be
the
last
to
go.
But
don't
worry.
Once
the
others
are
dead,
It
always
does.
This
doesn't
make
sense.
You
said
that
you
die
in
the
order
But
my
friends
died
last
Wait.
Died
last?
Backwards.
Are
you
sure?
KIMBERLY:
In
my
premonition,
Then
Evan,
then
me
and
my
friends.
Why
is
this
even
happening
to
me?
That's
what
Alex
used
to
ask
himself.
So,
what
am
I
supposed
to
do?
Clear.
-Watch
out
for
the
signs.
Have
you
ever
seen
anything
An
in-your-face
irony
kind
of
thing?
The
songs
on
the
radio.
Yeah,
the
guy
in
the
beer
truck,
Well,
don't
ignore
it.
Recognizing
those
signs
usually
means
You
gotta
help
me.
-I
don't
have
to
do
anything.
Take
a
look
around.
If
you
were
smart,
you'd
save
yourself,
How
can
you
say
that?
My
friends
are
dead.
That's
how
I
can
say
that.
And
this
is
what
happened
to
Alex
Get
out.
Before
you
hurt
me
or
yourself.
-All
right,
you
know
what?
I
think
you're
a
coward.
You
hide
out
in
here
...and
selfish
to
help
any
other
person.
In
my
opinion,
you're
already
dead.
I
tried
calling
you
last
night.
-Evan
Lewis
is
dead.
I've
been
getting
calls
all
morning
We're
meeting
tonight
at
my
apartment.
Wait,
wait,
Well,
at
first,
no,
I
didn't.
Until
last
year
when
I
was
dispatched
Clean
up,
I
don't
....
-Did
you
see
that?
-Pigeons.
-it's
a
sign.
If
Clear's
right
about
the
order...
...then
Nora
and
Tim
are
gonna
be
-I'm
not
following
you.
If
we
don't
find
them,
they're
gonna
die.
JEAN:
If
he
gives
me
the
gas
and
I
wake
up
LAUGHS]
Tim.
There
you
are.
We
missed
you
in
here.
We
got
hung
up
by
that
accident
Good
Lord.
How
lucky
that
you're
okay.
Your
mom
says
Not
really.
I'm
disappointed,
Tim.
Uh-huh.
Agh.
Yeah,
that
one's
gonna
have
to
be
filled.
Damn
those
pigeons.
How
many
times
am
I
gonna
have
Okay.
This
will
only
sting
for
an
moment.
Open
big.
Little
wider.
Wider.
Okay.
Agh,
God.
How
do
they
expect
me
to...?
Would
you
rather
just
have
-Yeah.
Jean,
I'm
gonna
need
you
in
here.

No,
you're
gonna
have
to
speak
up.
What?
I
can't
hear
you.
Excuse
me,
what?
Yes,
the
6th
at
2
p.m.
Jean!
Let
me
get
this
started.
Now,
Tim,
you'll
be
awake,
...but
you're
not
gonna
be
able

Okay,
great,
thanks.
The
cleaning
lady
said
they're
at

Goddamn
it
anyway.
NORA:
Okay,
I
got
it.
Not
again.
Be
careful.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
There
we
go.
DENTIST:
What
did
he
say
about
your
tooth?
-Did
he
say--?
THOMAS:
Nora!
What?
Pigeons?
Hey,
whoa,
whoa!
Kid,
kid!
Whoa,
whoa!
-No!
MAN:
-Stay
back!
Stay
back!


Nora's
not
coming.
-No,
but
she's
next.
We
have
to--
This
is
really
happening
again,
isn't
it?
I
hoped
we'd
get
there
...and
Clear
Rivers
was
just
full
of
shit...
...and
Evan
Lewis'
death
But
we're
all
gonna
die,
aren't
we?
I'm
so
scared.
I
know
you
didn't
ask
for
any
of
this...
...but
I
don't
think
you
have
it
in
you
A
second
one
just
died.
I
hope
you're
ready
for
this.
It's
this
way.
How
is
this
guy
gonna
help
us
anyway?
He
seemed
to
know
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
Well,
shouldn't
we
knock
first?
He
probably
already
knows
we're
coming.
Hello,
Clear.
I've
been
expecting
you.
Oh,
my
God.
-That's
Evan
Lewis.
Just
a
simple
question
and
Dead...
...yet
still
fresh.
Ha,
ha.
Look,
we
drove
a
long
way
to
get
here...
...so
if
you
happen
to
know
how
...it
would
be
really
great
if
you
told
us.
You
can't
cheat
death.
Bullshit.
But
Alex
and
I
cheated
death
not
once,
The
design
is
flawed.
It
can
be
beaten.
Such
fire
in
you
now.
People
are
always
most
alive
Don't
you
think?

Look,
please.
If
you
know
of
anything
...what
harm
could
it
do?
Only
new
life
can
defeat
death.
What
the
hell
does
that
mean?
Some
people
say
For
every
life,
there's
a
death.
But
the
introduction
of
...that
can
invalidate
the
list,
You
have
to
follow
the
signs,
Kimberly.
How
do
you
know
my
name?
-Whoa,
heh.
"New
life
defeats
death.
I
mean,
where
did
you
find
that
guy?
I
know.
I
mean,
I
thought
he
was
supposed
What
the
fuck
are
you
thinking?
Heh.
I'm
thinking
suck
on
my
junk,
beyotch.
Little
punk.
-What
is
it?




You
have
to
tell
us,
what
did
you
see?
Kimberly,
look
at
me.
I
was
driving
a
white
van...
...and
I
must
have
lost
control,
-And
I
drowned.
I
can
practically
taste
the
water
Remember?
The
on-ramp.
There
was
a
pregnant
woman
He
said
only
new
life
can
defeat
death.
If
she
gives
birth
to
a
baby
...a
brand-new
soul
that
was
never
part
It
throws
the
whole
list
out
of
whack
-Seems
like
a
reach,
don't
you
think?
-Find
the
lady's
number.
We
have
to
find
her,
warn
her
about
the
lake
-That'll
be
an
easy
conversation.
There
could
be
thousands
of
white
vans
Hey.
I'm
a
cop,
remember?
Wait,
that's
it.
Got
it.
With
the
plate
number,
Here
we
go.
The
vehicle
is
a
delivery
van
registered
We
should
pick
them
up
pretty
quickly.
Come
on,
let's
get
to
the
meeting.

Hey,
hold
the
door!
Hey,
let
go
of
my
shoe!
Give
me
my
shoe!
I
wrote
to
management
two
weeks
ago
Is
that
dog
shit,
dude?
EW.
Uh,
you
got
something
on
your
....
Heh.
it's
still
there,
bro.
No,
it's
all
right.
I'll
do
it
if
you
want
me
to
do
it.
Just
let--
I'll--
Let
me
do
it.
What?
Hey,
man.
How
you
doing?
Listen,
any
word
on
that
white
van
yet?
Okay,
well,
keep
checking.

-Does
anybody
have
a
Valium?
Here.
You're
just
gonna
want
to
take
Keep
them
coming.
If
what
you're
saying
is
true,
This
is
crazy,
people.
Come
on.
First
death
is
stalking
us
You're
not
next,
Nora.
Nobody
has
to
be
next.
That's
the
point.
We
need
to
help
each
other
Oh,
this
cannot
be
happening.
See,
because
my
career
is
at
a
peak
I
just
bought
a
house.
Maybe
if
you
shut
the
fuck
up,
Yeah,
like
I'm
gonna
take
advice
Okay,
look,
if
you
know
what
to
look
for,
If
I
call
and
say,
I
don't
know,
"subway,"
A
place
where
no
subway
CLEAR:
Just
because
Kimberly
...it
doesn't
mean
we're
not
all
capable
Okay,
okay,
look.
I
gotta
call
bullshit.
I
mean,
I've
sat
here
and
listened
...and
I
think
it's
just
all
bullshit.
Call
it
what
you
want.
Darling,
my
ass
is
alive.
Huh?
There
is
nobody
after
us
but
you,

I
should
have
seen
that
coming.
-Yeah.
...why
don't
you
just
She's
the
only
one
We
need
to
look
out
for
each
other
We
need
to
safe-proof
this
death-trap.
-Get
you
to
step
out
of
the
van,
miss?
-What
did
I
do?
Ugh.
Screw
this.
I'm
going
for
a
smoke.
No,
no,
no,
it's
not
safe
out
there.
So?
Nora's
gotta
bite
it
Oh,
you
people
have
no
sense
of
humor.
Nora,
you
okay?
Four
years
ago,
my
husband
died.
Now
Tim.
There's
nothing
left
for
me.
Look,
don't
say
that,
okay?
If
it
is
my
time
to
go
and
be
in
heaven
You
gotta
trust
me,
okay?
We
stick
together
long
enough
If
you'll
excuse
me,
Nora.
-What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
-Don't
leave,
Eugene.
I
control
my
life,
all
right?
Not
some
crazy
list
-Well--
EUGENE:
You
may
scare
these
people,
RORY:
Be
careful,
man.
-What?
I'm
just
gonna
put
this
in
the...
...closet
Aah!
Sorry.
Whoa.
A
man
with
hooks?
Man
with
hooks.
Hey,
I
think
I
see
a
man
with
hooks.
Is
that...
-...a
sign?
-Do
you
guys
see
that?
-The
phone.

What
the
fuck?

-Hello?
-Who
is
this?
Officer
Burke,
I
can't--
What?
What
does
he--?
What?
A
man
with
hooks
is
gonna
kill
you.
What,
what?
What
is
it,
Nora?

-Wait,
wait,
wait.
-Wait,
wait,
Nora!
-Will
you
stop
it?
Let
me
go!

Let
go
of
me!
Help
me!
Kat!

Oh,
my
God.
Help
me!
-Wait!


Aah,
let
me
out.
Good,
I
got
it,
thanks.
Isabella's
being
held
at
-It
almost
kicked
my
ass.
-I
control
my
life!
-You
hear
me,
you
reaper
cocksucker?
-What
happened?
Where's
Nora?
-Back
the
fuck
up!
What's
wrong,
man?
THOMAS:
-Give
me
the
gun.
Whoa,
Eugene,
-You
just
gotta
calm
down,
man.
-No,
no,
no!
-I
ain't
going
out
like
that.
-On
my
terms!
You
hear
me?

RORY:
You
don't
keep
it
loaded?
-Maybe
they're
all
duds.
Never.
That's
impossible.
It
wasn't
his
turn
to
die.
Can
we
find
the
pregnant
woman
now,
RORY:
I
mean,
someone
in
this
car
Do
the
rest
of
us
really
feel
Hopefully
her.
Okay,
guys,
let's
not
panic.
How
do
you
know?
You
said
she
was
gonna
drive
into
a
lake.
How
can
she
Look
at
me.
Come
on.
Does
it
look
like
I'm
in
the
condition
Look,
hopefully
the
district
judge
will
have

Marcus.
Marcus,
Marcus.
When
I
get
out
of
here,

-Oh,
my
God.
-My
water
just
broke.
My
water,
it
just
broke.
No,
not
here.
-Don't
just
stand
there.
Get
me
to
a
hospital.
I
am
not
gonna
have
my
baby
-Get
me
to
the
hospital!
Sheriff
Perry,
this
is,
uh--
God,
I
need
the
car!
My
van.
My
van.
Take
my
van.
Um,
okay.
Okay.
Yeah,
we'll
go.
We'll
go.
Uh--
Yeah,
we'll
go.
Here.
Come
on,
come
on.
EUGENE:
It's
not
the
first
time
I
cheated
death.
Kid
came
to
school
with
a
knife,
Huh.
Teacher
would
have
been
me...
...but
I
was
transferred
That's
fucking
weird,
man.
You
want
weird?
Last
year,
...when
a
call
came
in
about
Frank
decided
to
let
me
handle
it
alone.
He
died
that
night
in
a
shootout.
If
that
call
had
come
in
Oh,
my
God.
I'm
sorry,
heh.
it's
just
I
got
one
too.
Okay,
last
May,
...at
this
cheesy
little
bed-and-breakfast
Anyhow,
there's
this
major
gas
leak
...and
all
the
guests
suffocated
-So,
what
happened?
The
bus
I
was
on
splattered
some
girl
Was
that
in
Mount
Abraham?
Yes.
How
did
you
know?
That
bus
you
were
on
killed
She
was
supposed
to
die
on
Flight
180.
Hey,
do
you
guys
remember
...that
collapsed
last
year
Well,
I
had
tickets
to
go.
But
one
night,
you
know,
I'm
in
Paris
...and
sipping
lattes
and
such.
And
then
all
of
a
sudden...
...this
dude
out
of
nowhere
-Carter.
The
teacher
I
replaced,
She
was
from
Mount
Abraham.
Shit.
The
call
about
the
train
wreck
...that
was
the
night
Wait
a
minute.
Wait,
wait.
The
people
who
got
off
of
Flight
180.
CLEAR:
Kimberly,
tell
us
what
happened.
About
a
year
ago,
I
was
supposed
to
meet
her
outside,
but
...about
some
kid
that
committed
suicide.
I
kept
thinking,
"How
can
you
strangle
I
don't
know,
it
felt
wrong.
And
yet
....
I
heard,
um,
Some
kids
were
trying
to
steal
She
tried
to
fight
them
off,
After
the
funeral,
I
kept
thinking
I
guess
everyone
must
think
that.
But
I
guess
I
was
right.

Get
there.
-Could
you
drive
a
little
faster
maybe?
God.
When
we
got
off
Flight
180,
It
affected
everyone
and
everything
I'm
not
sure
I'm
understanding
you.
Being
alive
after
we
were
supposed
to
die,
A
rift
in
death's
design.
So
if
you
had
never
gotten
...we
wouldn't
be
alive
in
the
first
place.
Yes,
that's
why
death
It's
tying
up
all
the
loose
ends,

Whoa!
Oh,
Shit!
Jesus
Christ!

Hang
on.

-Is
everybody
all
right?
Oh,
God.
-God,
Eugene.
Oh,
my
legs!

ISABELLA:
-it's
not
gonna
wait.
Do
you
want
to
deliver
this
baby?
ISABELLA:

to
go.
Go!
Just--
Okay,
okay!
-Easy,
easy.
Keep
his
head
up.
I
think
he
has
a
collapsed
lung.
MAN:
Everyone
okay?
You're
gonna
be
all
right,

KIMBERLY:
Hey,
hey,
you!
Hey!
Come
on.
Help
me
out.
You
gotta
get
me
out
of
here
before
I
think
it's
okay.
I
don't
smell
any
gas
All
right,
get
this
thing
off
me.
-Okay.
Be
careful.
Ready?
Okay.
Aah!
Oh,
God,
Jethro!
Jesus
Christ!
I
gotta
be
able
to
use
my
legs
I'm
so--
Dad!

-Eugene,
everything's
gonna
be
okay.
We're
gonna
get
you
to
the
hospital.
Check
the
gauges
on
the
regulator
-And
look
out
for
potholes
and
puddles.
And
watch
out
for
power
lines!
RORY:
You
trying
to
get
yourself
killed,
You
gotta
use
your
head,
man.
MAN:
Get
that
news
van
back.
Okay,
let's
go.
How's
she
doing?
I
don't
know.
-Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
When
I
die,
uh...
...is
it
gonna
hurt?
I
don't
know.
You're
gonna
die
after
me,
right?
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
Would
you
take
these?
And
if
I
die,
um...
...would
you
throw
out
all
my
drugs
Just,
you
know,
anything
Please?
Thank
you.
