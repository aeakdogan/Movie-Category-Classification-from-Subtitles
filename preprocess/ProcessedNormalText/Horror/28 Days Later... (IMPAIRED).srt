Bingo!

Fucking
hell.

Fucking
hell.
-
Oh,
God...
If
you
wanna
get
'em
out
of
here.
-
I
can
pop
these,
no
problem.
Security,
we
have
a
break-in.
Get
the...
I
know
who
you
are.
If
you
don't
wanna
get
hurt,
The
chimps
are
infected.
They're
highly
-
Infected
with
what?
Infected
with
what?
Rage.
-
What
is
he
talking
about?
No!
No!
No!
Listen,
you
sick
bastard,
We'll
get
you
out
of
here.
The
animals
are
contagious.
The
infection
Stop...
Stop!
You've
no
idea!

Get
it
off!
Help
me!
Get
it
off!
Get
it
off!
-
What's
the
matter
with
her?

Oh,
my
God!
-
What's
the
matter
with
her?
Oh,
God...


Hello?

Hello?

Hello!

Hello?
Hello!

Hello?
Hello?


Father?
Father,
are
you
OK?
Oh,
shouldn't
have
done
that.
Shouldn't
have
done
that.
Shit!

Over
here!
-
Over
here!
Go,
go,
go!
Keep
going!
-
What
the
fuck
is
going
on?
-
Covered
everything.
Let's
go!
Let's
go!
-
What
the
fuck
is
going
on?
Come
on!
Man
walks
into
a
bar
with
a
giraffe.
The
giraffe
falls
over.
The
man
goes
to
leave
and
the
barman
says
He
says
"No,
it's
not
a
lion.
It's
a
giraffe".
He's
completely
humourless.
You
two
should
get
on
like
a
house
on
fire.
So
who
are
you?
You're
from
the
hospital.
-
Are
you
a
doctor?
I'm
a
bicycle
courier.
I
was
riding
a
package
from
Farringdon
to
Then
I
wake
up
today
in
hospital.
I'm
hallucinating
or
I'm...
What's
your
name?
Jim.
I'm
Mark.
This
is
Selena.
OK,
Jim.
I've
got
some
bad
news.
It
started
as
rioting,
and
right
from
Because
it
was
happening
And
then
it
wasn't
on
the
TV
any
more.
It
was
in
the
street
outside.
It
was
a
virus.
An
infection.
You
didn't
need
a
doctor
to
tell
you
that.
It
was
the
blood.
There
was
something
in
the
blood.
By
the
time
they
tried
to
evacuate
The
infection
was
everywhere.
The
army
blockades
were
overrun.
And
that's
when
the
exodus
started.
The
day
before
broadcasting
stopped,
there
were
reports
of
Infection
We
didn't
hear
anything
more
after
that.
-
What's
the
government
doing?
Of
course
there's
a
government!
There's
always
a
government.
No,
there's
no
government,
No
TV,
no
radio,
no
electricity.
You're
the
first
uninfected
person
Where's
your
family?
They're
dead.
Like
Selena's.
Yours
will
be
dead
too.
Look,
I
have
to
find
them.
You'll
go
and
come
back,
yeah?
-
You
won't.
No
one
ever
comes
back.
So
lesson
one.
You
never
go
anywhere
alone
Lesson
two.
Only
travel
during
daylight.
We'll
take
you
tomorrow.
We'll
all
go
and
find
Eat.
If
you
want
her
to
slow
down,
-
If
there's
anyone...
-
Anyone...
OK.

Jim...
Wait!
They
died
peacefully.
I'm
not
grateful.
My...
parents
and
my
sister,
hoping
maybe
we
could
get
on
a
plane,
I
remember
my
dad
had
all
this
cash,
even
though
cash
was
completely
useless.
About
20,000
other
people
had
the
same
idea.
Crowd
was
surging.
I
lost
my
grip
on
my
sister's
hand.
I
remember
the
ground
was
soft.
I
looked
down
Like
a
carpet.
People
who
had
fallen
and...
Somewhere
in
the
crowd
No
one
could
run.
Climb
over
more
people.
And
I
got
up
on
top
of
this
kiosk.
Looking
down,
you
couldn't
tell
Then
I
saw
my
dad.
My
dad.
His
face...
Selena's
right.
We
don't
have
time
to
get
back
to
the
shop
My
room's
up
at
the
top.
No,
we'll
all
sleep
in
the
same
room.
It's
safer.

Jim.
-
You're
back.
-
How
was
it?
Give
me
a
drink
of
that,
will
ya?
-
It's
empty.
Here.
I'll
start
working
on
them,
then.
Mark!
Mark!
Selena!
Help!

It's
clear.
-
That's
Mr
Bridges.
And
his
daughter.
From
four
doors
down.
-
Were
you
bitten?
Did
any
of
the
blood
get
in
your
mouth?
No.
Mark?
Wait...

Get
that
cleaned
off.
Do
you
have
any
clothes
here?
Um...
I...
Yes.
Then
get
them
and
get
dressed.
More
Infected
will
be
coming.

How
did
you
know?
-
The
blood.
I
didn't
know
he
was
infected.
If
someone
gets
infected,
It
might
be
your
brother,
your
sister
Just
so
you
know
where
you
stand,
He
was
full
of
plans.
Do
you
want
us
to
find
a
cure
and
Plans
are
pointless.
Staying
alive's
as
good
as
it
gets.
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
What's
that?
Let's
go.
What
is
it
about
tower
blocks
Stop
talking.
It's
a
long
way
up.

Do
you
need
a
break?
-
You?
Now
I
do
need
a
break.
What's
up?
Nothin'.
I
got
a
headache.
-
Bad?
-
Why
didn't
you
say
something
before?
You've
got
no
fat
on
you
So
you're
crashing.
There
isn't
a
lot
we
can
do
about
that
except
pump
you
full
of
painkillers
Pepsi
or
Lilt?
Do
you
have
any
Tango?
Actually,

Quiet!
That's
an
Infected.
Oh
no,
they're
in.
Move!
Wait
up,
Selena!
Wait
for
me,
please!
Please,
Selena!
Please!
-
Wait
for
me!
-
Run!
Please!
For
fuck's
sake!
-
Selena!
Down
the
corridor.
Flat
157.
Move!
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Open
the
door!
Open
the
door!
-
Open
up!
What?
-
Open
the
fucking
door!
Let
them
in,
Hannah.
Let
them
inside.
Go
in.
Go
in!

So,
I'm
Frank,
anyway.
Jim.
-
Selena.
This
is
my
daughter
Hannah.
Come
on,
sweetheart.
Say
hello.
Come
on.
So...
This
is
great.
Just
great.
Calls
for
a
celebration,
I'd
say.
Why
don't
you
all
sit
down
and...
Hannah,
what
have
we
got
to
offer?
We've
got
Mum's
crme
de
menthe.
Great.
Crme
de
menthe.
Oh,
yeah.
Look,
sit,
please.
Get
comfortable.
-

Where
are
the
bloody
glasses?
Nah,
the
good
ones.
It's
a
celebration.
Top
cupboard.
So
this
is
your
place?
It's
nice.
There.
I
know
it
isn't
much
but,
well,
cheers.
Cheers.

You
OK
in
there,
Jim?
Yeah.
Sorry
we
couldn't
spare
the
water.
You'll
have
to
use
the
bucket.
Have
to
empty
it
each
morning.
Just
chuck
it
over
the
balcony.
It's
fine.
Listen,
it's
late.
We're
gonna
turn
in.
We
have
a
spare
room.
In
there.
Are
you
and
Selena...?
No.
No,
no,
no.
Um...
I'll
take
the
living
room.
It's
fine.
Right.
No,
I
mean,
yeah.
So,
um...
-
Goodnight,
then.
Very
spruce.
-
Very
shredded.
-
So
what
do
you
make
of
them?
Probably
need
us
more
than
we
need
them.
I
think
they're
good
people.
-
Good
people?
You
should
be
more
concerned
about
-
Because
if
they
slowed
you
down...
-
In
a
heartbeat.
I
wouldn't.
Then
you're
gonna
wind
up
I'm
gonna
get
some
sleep.
Selena...
You
think
I
don't
get
it,
but
I
do
get
it.
And
I
know
I'd
be
dead
already
Sure.
No,
look...
I
mean,
thank
you.
And
I
mean,
sure.
Goodnight,
Jim.
Goodnight.
We
lost
water
pressure
three
weeks
ago.
I
thought
we'd
be
OK
with
the
water
But
it
vanishes
so
quick
You
drink
it,
it
evaporates,
turns
stagnant.
They're
all
empty.
Hasn't
rained
in
ten
days.
You
can
set
up
a
plastic
sheet
Saw
it
on
TV
once,
but
I
can't
make
it
work.
You'd
never
think
it.
Needing
rain
so
badly.
Not
in
fucking
England!
Jim,
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
stay
here.
-
There's
been
no
broadcasts
for
weeks.

Salvation
is
here.
If
you
can
hear
this,
you're
not
alone.
There
are
others
like
you.
We
are
soldiers
and
we
are
armed.
Oh,
my
God.
Soldiers.
-
Quiet.
There's
more.
27
miles
northeast
of
Manchester.
-
You
must
find
us.
Salvation
is...
-
It's
a
recording?
But
this
is
where
it's
telling
us
to
go.
Just
there.
The
way
things
are,
we
might
need
"We"?
Sound
carries
in
this
flat.
Me
and
Hannah
-
Look,
I
didn't...
I
can't
leave
the
block
if
it's
the
two
of
us.
Something
might
happen
to
me.
But
with
other
people...
If
it's
a
recording,
-
It's
possible.
There
is
no
answer!
-
Maybe
they
have
a
cure.
-
The
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
reach
them.
Or
die
here.
And
anyway,
it
isn't
true
what
Dad
said.
We
need
each
other.
And
we'll
never
be
safe
in
the
cities.
So
we
have
to
try
and
get
there.
Get
there
how?
Just
so
you
know,
-

What
do
you
think?
Then
we
should
take
the
indirect
route.

Let's
just
get
it
done.

No,
no.
No.
See,
this
is
a
really
shit
idea.
You
know
why?
So
we're
gonna
drive
into
the
tunnel
It's
really
fucking
obviously
a
shit
idea!
Hold
on!
Dad!

Fuck!
The
world's
worst
place
to
get
a
flat.
Agreed.
I
think
we'd
better
do
this
quick.
I've
got
the
wheel.
You're
on
the
jack.
Do
you
hear
that?
Hear
what?

Right,
I've
done
it.
Dad?

-
Jesus
Christ!
Fucking
rats!
They're
running
from
the
Infected.
Move
it!
Forget
the
jack,
Hannah.
Grab
hold!
One,
two,
three,
lift!
Lift,
lift!
-

Don't
look
at
them!
Don't
look!

Come
on,
Hannah!
Almost.
-
Get
the
tyre
on,
Hannah!
Three,
two,
one,
drop
it!
-
Get
in
the
car!
-
Frank,
drive!

Whoo!
Goodbye,
you
fuckers!
Frank,
stop
the
cab.
Let's
shop.

You...
You...
You...

Anybody
seen
any
buns?
Hmm.
Irradiated.
Don't
take
anything
I
think
you
can
eat
that
raw.
Decaffeinated
coffee...
Put
that
back.
Can't
just
take
any
crap.
If
I
never
see
another
chocolate
bar
again,
Not
counting
Terry's
Chocolate
Orange!
Now,
single
malt,
Warm
but
not
aggressive.
-

Takes
out
the
fire
but
leaves
in
the
warmth.
Either
we
do
this
now
or
we're
walking.
Not
you.
-
Stay
close,
Jim.
You
heard.
Where
are
you
going?
We've
got
enough
food,
Jim.
We
don't
have
any
cheeseburgers.

Like
going
on
holidays
Oh,
Jesus.
Hello?
I
hate
you!
Find
anything?
-
Find
anything,
Jim?
OK,
we're
done
here.
OK,
Hannah.
Easy.
Brake!
Brake,
brake!
Out.

Mmmm!
Oh
my
God!
I
can,
like,
taste
the
vitamin
C.
Mmmm,
the
raisins
are
so
moist.
What
did
you
say?
The
raisins.
They're
so
moist.
Look
over
here.
Like
a
family.

Do
you
think
they're
infected?

No.
They're
doing
just
fine.
Come
on.
Let's
eat!
Know
what
I
was
thinking?
That
you'll
never
hear
You'll
never
read
a
book
or
see
a
film
that
hasn't
already
been
shot.
Um...
that's
what
you
were
thinking.
No.
I
was
thinking
I
was
wrong.
About
what?
All
the
death.
All
this
shit.
It
doesn't
really
mean
anything
Well,
she's
got
her
dad
Cheeky
monkey!
I
was
wrong
when
I
said
See,
that's
what
I
was
thinking.
Was
it?
Mm.
You
stole
my
thought.
Sorry.
That's
OK.
You
can
keep
it.
It's
getting
late.
I
can't
sleep.
Me
neither.
Doesn't
feel
safe,
does
it?
Outside
like
this.
I
think
we're
safe
enough.
Selena
didn't
seem
to
have
any
trouble.
Yeah,
I
noticed
that.
Hey,
Selena...
What?
What
is
it?
How'd
you
get
to
sleep?
Bloody
hell.
Must've
needed
I
didn't
need
a
prescription.
Oh,
great.
Valium.
Not
only
will
we
be
able
to
get
to
sleep
but
if
we're
attacked
in
the
middle
-
Two
each.
Can
I,
Dad?
I
don't
think
so,
sweetheart.
Please?
-
No.
Come
on,
Frank.
Let
her
live
a
little.
-
Give
her
half
of
one.
Night-night.
You're
a
big
softie,
Frank.
Frank?
Hannah?
Frank?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!

Shh...
You're
having
a
bad
dream,
that's
all.
Thanks,
Dad.

Come
on,
sleepyhead.
Come
on,
Babe
Ruth.

Hurry
up.
-
Did
I
miss
breakfast?
-

Did
you
have
a
fry-up?

Our
location
27
miles
northeast
of
Manchester.
You
must
find
us.
Please!
Salvation
is
here.
The
answer
to
Infection
is
here.
Must
be
Manchester.
The
whole
of
Manchester,
the
whole
city.
No
fire
crews
to
put
it
out.
42nd
blockade.
This
is
it.
I
don't
understand,
Dad.
-
I
don't
like
this.
I
think
we
should
go.
Vehicles.
We
should
check
the
vehicles.
Nothing.
I
can't
believe
it.
Frank...
Frank!
-
We
have
to
go.
Go
fucking
where?!

Get
out
of
it.
Get
out
of
it!
Dad,
are
you
all
right?
Yeah,
I'm
fine,
sweetheart.
Sorry
I
lost
my
temper.
Hannah...
I
love
you
very
much.
-
What?
Stay
where
you
are.
-
Dad?
Keep
away!
Keep
away!
Keep
away!
-
Dad!

What's
wrong?
Dad!
Jim!
Jim,
he's
infected!
-
No!
-
Jim,
kill
him!
Jim!
Kill
him!
Stay
away
from
him!
Keep
away
from
the
body!
Dad?

Three
survivors.
One
male,
two
female.
I
repeat,
one
male,
two
female.
ETA,
15.
Put
the
kettle
on.
I'm
Major
Henry
West.
-
Welcome.
Hello,
Jim.
Hello.
Well,
we've
got
beds
with
clean
sheets
So
you
can
all
have
a
shower.
You
look
like
you
need
one.
Please.
It
ain't
funny.
I
got
loads
of
cooking
to
do,
Run
him
over!

How
is
she
doing?
She's
lost
her
dad,
Jim.
That's
how
she
is.
It's
all
fucked.
What
do
you
mean?
Oh,
don't
do
that.
Hey,
don't
do
that.
Hannah
is
what
Frank
says
she
is.
Tough,
-
Just
like
you'll
cope.
I
want
her
to
be
OK.
When
Hannah
had
her
dad
it
was
OK.
It
was
OK
for
them
and
it
was
OK
for
us.
Now
it's
all
just
fucked.
So
you
heard
our
broadcast?
-
Yeah,
we
did.
You
were
hoping
for
a
full
brigade.
An
army
-
We
were
just
hoping
for...
Yeah.
As
I
said
before,
it's
here.
Though
-
Just
feel
lucky
to
have
found
you.
The
fire
drove
hundreds
of
Infected
The
surrounding
area's
teeming
with
them.
But
don't
worry.
You're
quite
safe
here.
Flat
terrain
all
round
the
house.
Floodlights
High
perimeter
wall
which
helps.
And
we've
been
lacing
the
ground
You
wouldn't
want
to
mow
the
lawn,
Secondary
to
protection,
The
belly
of
the
house.
The
heart.
A
wood-fired
boiler
providing
us
with
hot
The
kitchen.
Here
you
are.
I'll
swap
you.
-
Now
don't
be
throwing
it.
Don't
be
fighting.
Jones,
our
resident
tin
opener.
-
What
are
you
cooking,
Jones?
I
can't
wait.
And
lastly,
meet
Mailer.
Mailer,
Jim.
Jim,
Mailer.
Got
infected
two
days
ago.
Mitchell
managed
to
knock
him
out
cold
Keeping
him
alive?
The
idea
was
to
learn
something
Have
him
teach
me.
And
has
he?
In
a
way.
He's
telling
me
he'll
never
bake
bread.
Farm
crops,
raise
livestock.
He's
telling
me
he's
futureless.
And
eventually
he'll
tell
me
how
long

?
You'll
have
to
wait
and
see
?
Hope
it's
chips,
it's
chips
?
We
hope
it's
chips,
it's
chips

Hat.
So,
what
have
we
here?
Tinned
ham,
tinned
peas,
tinned
beans
and...
-

Nice
one,
Doris!
-
It's
a
feast,
Jones.
Absolutely.
I
was
going
to
propose
a
toast
but
this
omelette
will
do
just
as
well.
-
To
new
friends.
Jones,
did
you
notice
while
cooking
I
thought
the
salt
might
cover
the
taste,
sir.
Get
rid
of
it.

Doris,
you
twat.
I
don't
suppose
you
can
cook,
can
you?
I
can't
tell
you
how
badly
we
need
What
a
fucking
disappointment.
We'll
have
eggs
again.
You
muppet!
Look
at
him,
eh?
He's
still
waiting
-
You
don't
know
nothing.
If
you
look
at
the
whole
life
of
the
planet,
we...
you
know,
Man
has
only
been
around
So
if
the
infection
wipes
us
all
out,
that
is
a
return
to
normality.
-
That
what
you
meant,
Bill?
Have
you
met
our
New
Age
sergeant?
Our
spiritual
guru.
Tell
me,
Farrell,
exactly
why
This
is
what
I've
seen
People
killing
people.
Which
is
what
I
saw
in
the
four
weeks
before
As
far
back
as
I
care
to
remember,
Which
to
my
mind
-
You're
not
eating?
You
must
eat,
Hannah.
I
don't
want
to
eat.
He's
one
of
the
people
you're
talking
about.

Let's

How

Mitchell!
Easy,

You

Sergeant
Farrell!
-
Mitchell,

action

Then
get
to
it.
Jones,
Bedford,
go
with
him.
Slow

-
Sergeant?
Clear
the
bodies
off
the
lawn.
The
rest
of
you,
go
with
him.
My
apologies.
Drink?
Look,
we're
grateful,
OK?
We're
very
grateful
for
your
protection
-
Who

you

Who
have
you
killed?
You
wouldn't
be
alive
I
killed...
I
killed
a
boy.
A
child?
Yes.
But
you
had
to.
Survival.
I
understand.
I
promised
them
women.
What?
Eight
days
ago
I
found
Jones
He
said
he
was
going
to
kill
himself
What
could
I
say
to
him?
We
fight
off
the
Infected
or
we
wait
What
do
nine
men
do
I
moved
us
from
the
blockade,
I
set
the
radio
Because
women
mean
a
future.
Selena!
Hannah!
-
What
is
it?
-
Jim,
wait!
Come
on!
We
get
in
the
car
and
we
go!
No!
You're
not
going
to
keep
them
here!
You
can't
keep
them
here!
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
keep
them
here!
You
can't
do
this!
Right,
get
him!
I
want
to
give
you
a
chance.
You
can
be
with
us.
But
I
can't
let
them
go.
OK,
Jim?
OK.
Him
too.

Smithers
says
And
Mr
Burns
says
And
that
was
my
favourite
joke
That's
what
they're
doing
a
few
across
the
Atlantic.
Eating
dinner
They're
sleeping
in
their
beds
But
we're
here
chained
to
a
fucking
radiator
Starting
the
world
again
when
the
rest
Just
imagine,
just
think
about
it.
How
could
Infection
cross
the
oceans?
How
could
it
cross
the
mountains
Right
now
TVs
are
playing
and
the
rest
of
the
world
Think!
Actually
think
about
it.
What
would
you
do
They
quarantined
us.
"There
is
no
Infection.
Time
to
go.
Quarantine?
-
Please...
You
see,
I'm
gonna
have
the
black
one.
Mitchell,
I
swear
to
God
Move.
Come
on,
move!
Get
up!
Get
up,
you
cunt!
Fucking
move!
Get
up!
Move
your
fucking
arse!

Come
on
then,

No,
Mitch.
Mitch,
just
use
the
gat.
-

So
you're
gonna
stick
me?
-

Why?

Is
that
how
you'd
let
-
I'll
shoot
them!
You'll
let
him
stick
me?
I'm
gonna
enjoy
this.
You
stupid
cunt!
What
are
you
doing?
-
You
wanna
shoot
me?
I'll
kill
you!
Fuck
it!
Get
up!
Get
after
him!
-
Jones,
move
it!
Where
are
you?
-
Can
you
see
him?

Oh
no.
We're
fucked.
We're
fucked!
Relax.
He's
over
the
wall.
He's
got
no
vehicle.
And
no
shooter.
He's
dead.


The
first
thing
we're
going
to
do
The
lady
of
the
house
which
she
certainly
has
no
use
for.
You
can't
do
it
to
Hannah.
Go
to
the
master
bedroom,
Yes,
sir.

No...

Ladies...
-
It's
only
dressing
up!
-
I
thought
girls
liked
dressing
up.

Selena!
Whoa,
whoa,
relax!
Selena!
Selena!
Selena!
You
need
to
leave
me
alone
-
Listen,
right.
The
OC
wants...
If
you
want
us
to
get
changed,
It's
just
polite.
Yeah,
all
right.
All
right.
Come
on,
lads.
Let's
leave
the
room.
We're
gonna
eat
these,
Hannah,
OK?
Are
you
trying
to
kill
me?
No,
sweetheart.
I'm
making
you
not
care.
OK?
What
you
doing?!

-
Someone's
at
the
blockade!
Move!
Stay
here
and
put
the
dresses
on.
Let's
go!
Go!
He
went
over
the
wall.
Shut
up,
Jones!
Stay
here.
Davis?

Fuck
it!

-
What
was
that?
I
heard
something.
It
sounded
like
a
Claymore
to
me.
All
right,
I'll
go
and
hit
the
floods,
Girls,
keep
an
eye
on
him,
will
ya?
Those
pills,
I
think
they're
having
an
effect.
I
can
feel
them.
And...
I
don't
feel
sleepy.
But...
They've
been
a
long
time.
What
are
you
gonna
do
Would
you
be
the
officer
if
Henry
was
dead?
Is
that
the
way
it
works?
Shut
up.
I
don't
think
they
are
coming
back.
-
I
said
shut
up!
They're
dead.
And
you're
gonna
be
next.
-
Get
up!
We're
gonna
get
out
of
here.
Don't
worry.
I
feel
fine.
Really.
Get
him
off
me!
Get
him
off
me!
It's
Jones!
It's
Jones!
Oi!
Where
the
fuck
are
you
going?

Don't
just
stand
there,
You
two,
in
there!
Move!

Come
on,
then!
What
the
fuck
you
gonna
do
now?

Come
on
up!
Col!
-
Defend
these
stairs
with
your
fucking
life!
-
Mailer's
loose.


Sorry...
-
Sir...
Shh.
Hannah?

Hannah?
Selena?
I
haven't
got
any
bullets.
Don't
fucking
leave
me!
Come
on!
Move!
Move!
Move!
It's
just
you
and
me
now,
darlin'.
Then
we'll
find
a
nice
little
fucking
place
And
we'll
live
happy
ever
after,
eh?

That
was
longer
than
a
heartbeat.
Jim?
Listen.
Listen.
It's
not
all
fucked.
We're
gonna
be
OK.
It's
not
all
fucked.
-
I've
got
to
explain
something.
It's
gonna
be
OK.
Hannah,
it's
OK!
He's
not
infected.
But
I
thought
he
was
biting
you.
I
was
kissing
her.
Are
you
stoned?
-
It's
a
long
story.
We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
Come
on!
Come
on!
Move!
You
killed
all
my
boys.
Wait...
Hannah!
Hannah?
Hannah!
Hannah!
Get
in.
They're
locked.
The
gates
are
locked!
Fucking
do
it!
Come
on,
Jim,
breathe!
Fucking
breathe!
Not
the
curtains
as
well.

You
looked
all
right
in
this,
you
know.
It's
coming!
-
You
definitely
heard
it?
-
I
can't
hear
anything!

Go.
Do
you
think
he
saw
us
this
time?
