At

Lady
Ashley,
wait!
Don't
go
in
there!

I'm
so
sorry.
My
family
has
had
the
honor
of
serving...
the
owners
of
Faraway
Downs
We
know
how
hard
this
land
can
be.
But
Lord
Maitland
Ashley-he-
he
never
gave
up.
The
only
thing
that
could
stop
this
decent
from
a
murderous
black,
And
he
will
be
brought
to
justice.
Let
us
now
pray
for
Maitland
Ashley...
that
his
soul
may
enter
peacefully

Lady
Ashley,
we
can
leave
for
Darwin

The

Mr.

a

Carney

authority
here.

let
him

go

And
there's

There
is
just
one
small
problem.
Having
dismissed
Fletcher,


Hyah!
Hyah!

It's
the
Drover!

Drover!
Drover!

-

Yeah,
Drover!
Yeah!
Teach
me
how
to
-
See
any
boys
in
there?
Goolaj,
go
see
if
they're

Mr.
Drover!

I'll
find
out
what
the
hell's
going
on.
-
Fill
the
water
trough,
son.
Where
the
hell
are
-
That's
what
I
need
to
speak
to
you
about.
-
We
disagreed,
and
I
dismissed
him.
-
Yes.
Well,
it
beggars
belief,
he
deliberately
let
the
cows
out
of
and
they
ran
off!
Damn!
Do
you
realize,
woman,
Mr.
Drover,
do
not
take
that
tone
with
me.
-
Don't
take
that
tone
with
you,
huh?
I'm
asking
you,
woman,
I
won't
get
another
drove
this
late
in
the
season.
-
Can't
you
just
round
them
up?
-
Yes.
You
just
go
get
them.
Oh!
Scattered
over
a
million
acres
That's
a
great
idea.
Stupid
cow.
Mr.
Drover,
on
moral
grounds.
Moral
grounds?
You're
at
that
again,
are
ya?
He
wanted
to,
uh,
exploit
you,
did
he?
-
Fancy
you,
did
he?
Stop
it.
I
-
Is
there
any
man
in
this
-
Please.
Mr.
Fletcher
is
working
for
Mr.
Carney.
They
were
pushing
the
best
across
the
river
They
were
stealing!
-
There's
no
surprises
there.
All
right,
all
right.
-
Well-
And
you
can't
win
against
Carney.
Grab
King
Carney's
offer
and
go
the
hell
That
way
you'd
make
everybody
happy,

So
you're
just
going
to
walk
away?
I
learned
a
long
time
ago
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Mr.
Drover,
wait!
Please,
please,
please!
-
Please.
I-
Listen.
You
said
that
your
dream
was
with
a
bush
brumby.
If
you
agree
to
help
me,
I-
I
will
give
you
my
Capricornia.


And
how
we
gonna
do
a
drove
Oh,
crikey.

Bandy
was
a
drover's
boy
Some
white
stockmen
like
to
have
to
keep
'em
company
at
night.
They
shave
their
heads,
and
work
'em
like
any
other
stockman
That's,
uh-What
do
you
call
it?
-
Exploiting
them.
Anyway,
we're
still
in
trouble.
We
gotta
have
seven
good
riders
at
least,
-
What
have
we
got?
We've
got
me-
-
Magarri.
-
Goolaj-
We
got
Daisy.
Nice
ride.
Oh.
What
about
Mr.
Sing
Song?
-
Hey.
Don't
look
at
me.
Cook's
wagon
at
best.
We
need
two
more
experienced
riders.
I
did
that
run
once
back
in
1935...
with
Magarri,
Dingo
Jones
Drongo
brothers.
-
true
knights
of
the
outback.

can.
But
don't.

ride'em
real
bloody
good!

no-good
cheeky
bulls

All
right.
Five
and
a
quarter.
What?
Lady,
this
ain't
trotting

Mr.
Drover,
I
could
show
you
Pretty
sure,
when
it
comes
to
horses,
-
Bring
the
horse.
Bring
the
horse.

Oh,

should
be
interesting.
Move
along!
Move
along!

Move
along!
Rah!
