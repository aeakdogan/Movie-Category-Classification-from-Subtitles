in
your
party?
I
don't
really
know,
sir.
-You
don't
know?
One
of
the
men
took
sick
It
took
three
or
four
And--
He
took
terrible
sick,
sir.
A
corporal
should
know
Oh,
yes,
sir.
Have
you
a
nervous
affliction?
It
may
be
funny
to
you,
No,
sir.
We
must
put
a
stop
-I
say,
Reeves?
Ever
built
a
bridge
Yes,
sir,
half
a
dozen
of
them
If
this
were
your
bridge...
...how
would
you
get
it
under
way?
Get
it
under
way,
sir?
First
of
all,
Oh,
why
not?
I
was
trying
to
tell
you...
...the
Japanese
couldn't
have
You
see
those
piles?
They're
sinking.
We
could
drive
those
logs
Where
would
you
build
it?
Further
downstream,
sir.
Then
we'd
have
solid
bedrock
Hughes,
if
this
were
your
bridge,
Not
the
way
they're
doing
it.
Uncoordinated
activity.
No
teamwork.
Some
parties
are
working
Yes.
I
say,
gentlemen,
we
have
Thanks
to
the
Japanese,
There's
no
order,
no
discipline.
-Our
task
is
to
rebuild
the
battalion.
Which
isn't
going
to
be
easy.
Fortunately,
we
have
-The
bridge,
sir?
We'll
teach
them
a
lesson
in
Western
Show
what
a
British
Yes.
I
see
your
point,
sir.
I
know
how
difficult
...where
you
can't
find
what
you
need.
-There's
the
challenge.
You
really
want
them
You're
not
usually
I
know
our
men.
If
there
weren't
any
work,
-That
we
would,
sir.
But
it's
going
to
be
a
proper
bridge.
Here
again
I
know
the
men.
It's
essential
that
they
-Right,
men?
Reeves,
you're
Tell
me
what
you
want
and
we'll
-We'll
do
out
best,
sir.
We
must
draw
up
our
plans...
...then
arrange
a
conference
...and
set
him
straight.
That
takes
care
of
all
Oh,
yes.
The
next
point
is
unpleasant
Sorry
to
say,
the
position
...and,
I
have
to
add,
incorrectly.
Incorrectly?
Unfortunately,
yes.
Our
engineer
has
made
...and
decided
that
the
river
bottom
Too
soft?
Mud!
All
the
work
-Reeves,
will
you
carry
on?
-Reeves,
will
you
carry
on?
Those
piles
of
yours
could
be
hammered
It
would
collapse
The
pressure
and
soil
resistance
Reeves,
before
you
get
too
involved....
I
take
it
we
all
agree
...we
build
a
new
bridge,
at
the
site
Let's
proceed
to
the
next
point.
Let's
proceed
to
the
next
point.
I
decided
to
alter
-Alter?
From
1
.5
yards
of
earth
moved
I'm
sure
it
will
Hughes
has
all
the
facts.
I've
done
a
time
study
You
see,
the
available
forces
I'd
urge
we
revise
the
Just
a
moment.
Colonel,
it
would
save
Would
it
be
possible
Of
course.
-Carry
on.
If
we
increase
the
squads
...l'm
certain
the
total
daily
output
Now,
Colonel
Saito,
Now,
there's
another
important
As
the
British
...only
a
few
will
be
available
I
must
ask
you
to
lend
us
some
of
your
...so
the
final
stretch
of
track
can
I
have
already
given
the
order.
We
must
fix
the
daily
work
quota
I
thought
to
set
it
at
1
.5
yards
...but
isn't
it
best
That
would
also
create
a
healthy
I
have
already
given
the
order.
We'll
try
to
surpass
that,
I
think
that
completes
Thank
you,
Colonel
Saito,
Are
there
any
other
questions?
One
question.
Can
you
finish
the
bridge
in
time?
Frankly,
the
consensus
of
opinion
But
we'll
certainly
give
it
a
go.
Don't
forget
we
wasted
a
month
...for
which
I
was
not
to
blame.
Is
there
anything
else?
No.
Thank
you.
The
meeting
is
closed.
-Good
night.
I
hope
these
Japanese
appreciate
For
now
I'm
not
concerned
-Good
night,
Clipton.
By
the
way,
I
meant
to
tell
you...
...there
are
trees
here
And
the
elm
piles
of
London
Bridge
-Six
hundred
years,
Reeves?
Six
hundred
years.
That
would
be
quite
something.
I'm
looking
for
an
American
-Yes,
down
on
the
beach.
Kiss!
Too
many
eyes.
Too
many
eyes.
You
give
me
powders,
pills,
baths,
All
I
need
is
love.
It's
true.
Why
are
you
so
sure
Because
I'm
a
civilian
And
I
always
follow
my
heart.
Kiss.
How's
that,
commander?
Don't
call
me
commander.
It's
unromantic.
You're
an
officer
yourself.
How'd
you
like
it
Let's
be
democratic.
Yes,
sir.
Brass
ahoy.
He
wants
you.
He's
all
yours.
-I'm
going
for
a
swim.
-Commander
Shears?
My
name's
Warden.
-How
do
you
do?
That's
okay,
major.
Like
a
martini?
That's
very
kind.
Mind
if
I
have
one?
How
did
you
get
that?
Where
there's
a
hospital,
Yes,
of
course.
Jolly
good.
Well,
I'll
be
as
brief
as
possible.
I
belong
to
a
rather
rum
group
Our
headquarters
is
in
-Protecting
rare
plants
from
the
enemy?
-Sure
you
won't
have
one?
We
have
an
interest
You
could
give
us
no
end
Well,
I'm
leaving
...and
I
told
your
people
But
you
could
help
us
I
know
it's
a
terrible
imposition,
but
If
you
want
to
go
over
Very
kind.
-Who?
We're
one
of
his
special
pigeons.
Shall
we
say
this
evening,
then?
This
evening?
Out
of
the
question.
Tomorrow
morning
then?
-Okay,
1
0:00.
-Cheerio.
Good
luck.
Thanks.
You're
sorry,
but
You
couldn't
be
more
wrong.
General
salute!
General
salute!
Present
arms!
-May
I
see
your
pass,
please?
Major
Warden's
bungalow
Good
show,
Jenkins.
Good
show!
Come
along,
Thomson.
On
your
feet!
On
your
feet!
Come
on,
move
yourselves!
Very
clumsy,
Joyce,
very
clumsy.
Always
use
your
knife
You
see,
he's
gained
the
initiative.
Wait
a
minute!
-You're
sorry?
-I
thought
you
were
the
enemy.
-That'll
be
all,
Joyce.
-What
can
I
do
for
you?
I'll
show
you
the
way.
He'll
finish
I'll
show
you
the
way.
He'll
finish
-That's
the
end
of
his
lecture.
He
believes
in
keeping
our
training

-Major
Warden,
sir?
Good
of
you
to
come.
-They
took
care
of
you?
Thank
you,
staff.
Col.
Green
is
looking
forward
-Fascinating
place,
isn't
it?
We're
trying
to
discourage
the
use

What
do
you
do
here?
Sabotage,
demolition,
We're
using
P.E.,
plastic
explosives.
That
pop
was
made
It's
twice
as
powerful
as
gelignite
It's
quite
harmless
Thanks
for
telling
me.
It's

waterproof
You
can
do
what
you
like
with
it.
This
is
my
place.
Go
ahead.
