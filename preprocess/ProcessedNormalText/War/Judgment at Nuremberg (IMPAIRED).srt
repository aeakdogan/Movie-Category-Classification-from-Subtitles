didn't

it

so
bad.
A

sir.
This
is
where
the

They
all
came
here.
Thousands
of
them,

Does

It's
not

You

Well,
here
we

Hello.
Good

Welcome.
I'm

Thanks.
Let's

There
are
two
bedrooms
on
this
floor,
The

is
part
antique,
The

is
showing
signs
of

Quite
a
view,
isn't
it,
sir?
Uh...
Senator,
When

Who
used
to
live
here?
Is
there
anything
else

Sir,
any
questions?
-
You're
West
Point,
aren't
you?
-
What's
your
first
name?
Well,
Harry,
look.
I'm
not
West
Point,
and
It
puts
me
ill
at
ease.
You
think
it
would
be
if
you
were
to
call
me

OK,
Judge.
We

Captain,
I

is

yours,

Thank
you.
Do
you
think
I
need
the
three
servants?
Well,
it
helps
them
out
as
well
as
you.
Oh.
Well,
I
need
three

It's
good
to
have
a

Sure.
Sure.
I
was
the

You
know
I
wasn't

know

Let's
face
it.

Now
we're
down
to
judging

Some

I
hope
you're
not
sorry

wanted

No,

Well,
relax.

You're
gonna

See
you

Shall
we,

take
these
upstairs?
Oh,
yes,
thank

The
question
was


I

How
do
you
plead
to
the
charges
guilty
or
not
guilty?

Not
guilty
on
all
counts.

I

Are
you

by

Counsel?

Yes,
yes,
of
course,
I
am
represented.
How
do
you
plead
to
the
charges,
Nicht

You
may
be
seated.
Ernst
Janning.
Ernst
Janning,
are
you
represented
Ernst
Janning,
are
you
represented

I
represent
the
defendant,
Your
Honour.
How
do
you
plead
set
forth
in
the
indictment
against
you,

Your
Honour,
may
I
address
the
court?

The
defendant
does
not
recognise
and
wishes
to
lodge
a
formal
protest.
A
plea
of
not
guilty
will
be
entered.
The
prosecution
will
begin
Slow
and
easy,
Junior.
The
case
is
unusual,
in
that
committed
in
the
name
of
the
law.
These
men,
together
with
are
the
embodiment
of
what
passed
The
defendants
served
as
judges
Therefore
you,
Your
Honours,
will
be
sitting
in
judgment
And
this
is
as
it
should
be.
For
only
a
judge
knows
how
much
more
It
is
a
process
and
a
spirit.
It
is
the
house
of
law.
The
defendants
knew
this
too.
They
sat
in
their
black
robes
they
destroyed
justice
The
prosecution
-
The
interpreter
cannot
follow
you.
They
distorted,
they
perverted,
they
destroyed
This
in
itself
is
undoubtedly
a
great
crime.
But
the
prosecution
is
not
for
violating
constitutional
guaranties
The
prosecution
is
calling
them
brutalities,
torture,
atrocities!
They
share,
with
all
the
leaders
responsibility
for
the
most
malignant,
the
most
devastating
crimes
They
are
perhaps
more
guilty
for
they
had
attained
maturity
Their
minds
weren't
warped
They
embraced
the
ideologies
when
they,
most
of
all,
Here
they'll
receive
the
justice
They'll
be
judged
according
to
The
prosecution
asks
nothing
more.
Herr
Rolfe
will
make
the
opening


May
it
please
the
tribunal.


but
also
a
great
challenge...
for
an
advocate...
to
aid
this
tribunal
in
its
task.
The
entire
civilised
world
will
follow
closely
what
we
do
here.
For
this
is
not
an
ordinary
trial,
by
any
means
of
The
avowed
purpose
of
this
tribunal

is
broader
than
It
is
dedicated
to
the
reconsecration
It
is
dedicated
to
finding
a
code
of
justice
How
will
this
code
be
established?
It
will
be
established
in
a
clear,
honest
evaluation
in
the
indictment
In
the
words
of
the
great
American
"This
responsibility
that
no
one
contests
or
denies."
"It
will
be
found
in
considerations
"It
will
be
found,
most
of
all,
What
is
the
character
of
Ernst
Janning?
Let
us
examine
his
life
for
a
moment.
He
was
born
in
1885.
Received
the
degree
Became
a
judge
in
East
Prussia
in
1914.
Following
World
War
I,
he
became
and
one
of
the
framers
In
subsequent
years,
not
only
for
his
work
as
a
great
jurist,
which
are
still
used
He
became
Minister
of
Justice
If
Ernst
Janning
is
to
be
found
guilty,
certain
implications
must
arise.
A
judge
does
not
make
the
laws.
He
carries
out
the
laws
of
his
country.
The
statement
was
expressed
It
is
no
less
true
for
a
German
patriot.
Should
Ernst
Janning
have
carried
out
Or
should
he
have
refused
This
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
The
defence
is
as
dedicated
as
is
the
prosecution.
For
it
is
not
only
Ernst
Janning
It
is
the
German
people.
The
tribunal
will
recess
Yeah.
If
it's
all
right
with
you,
It
was
quite
a
damning
speech
I
wonder
if
those
men
for
the
things
he
listed
in
the
indictment.
I've
been
here
two
years,
you
find
that
responsibility
What
are
you
fellows
up
to
this
weekend?
My
wife
and
I
are
going
to
Lige.
There's
nothing
in
Lige.
My
son
was
in
the
101st.
He's
buried
in
the

-
I'm
sorry.

See
you
Monday,
Dan.
-
Coming
my
way?
I'm
waiting
for
some
records
from
Byers.
Right.
-
Here
are
the
reports
you
asked
for,
sir.
Captain,
do
you
think
you
could
get
me
-
There
are
quite
a
few
of
them.
And
also
a
copy
of
the
Weimar
-
Yes,
of
course.
-
How
long
have
you
been
here,
Captain?
-
Two
years,
that's
a
long
time.
-
Any
friends?
-
German
friends?
-
A
girl?
Her
parents
were
Nazis,
-
I
didn't
ask
you
that.
It's
natural
to
think
about
it.
I
thought
if
anybody
was
going
to
-
Will
there
be
anything
else?
Try
the
old

Thank
you.

-
Are
they
treating
you
all
right?
We
still
have
some
friends
who
have
-
I
can
tell
them
if
they
are
not.
Doctor
Janning...
we
are
both
in
an
embarrassing
position.
I
know
you
didn't
want
me
I
know
you
didn't
want
anyone.
But
I
must
tell
you
something.
Yes.
I
intend
to
represent
your
case
There
will
be
no
appeal
to
sentiment,
there
will
be
no
falling
The
game
will
be
played
We'll
see
whether
they
have
the
courage
The
way
I
see
it,
the
most
important
elements
in
the
case
and
the
Feldenstein-Hoffman
affair.
Doctor
Janning,
I
must
tell
you
something.
I
admired
you
It
was
because
I
thought
some
of
the
things
you
have
done
that
saw
me
through
the
war.
You
have
been
somebody
Is
that
all,
Herr
Rolfe?
-
Yes.
Dr
Wieck,
do
you
know
Yes,
I
know
him.
Will
you
tell
us
in
what
capacity?
We
served
in
the
Ministry
of
Justice
-
Did
you
know
him
before
that?
-
Did
you
know
him
well?
-
Was
he
a
protg
of
yours?
Why?
He
was
always
a
man
He
was

Dr
Wieck,
would
you,
uh...
would
you
tell
us,
the
position
of
the
judge

Germany
The
position
of
the
judge
Mm-hm.
Now
would
you
describe
after
the
coming
to
power

became
subject
to

They
were
subject
to
what
was
necessary
-
Would
you
explain
this,
please?
became
the
punishment
rather
than
objective
consideration
And
what
other
changes
were
there?
The
right
to
appeal
was
eliminated.
The
Supreme
Court
of
the
Reich
was
The
concept
of
race
was
made
And
what
was
the
result
of
this?
The
result?
The
result
was
to
hand
over
into
the
hands
of
the
dictatorship.
-
Dr
Wieck...
I'd
like
to
ask
a
few
questions.
Did
the
judiciary
protest
these
laws
A
few
of
them
did.
Those
who
did
Others...
adapted
themselves
to
the
new
situation.
Do
you
think
the
judiciary
At
first,
perhaps
not.
Later
it
became
clear
Thank
you.
Now,
would
you
please
describe
for
us
Its
characteristic
was
an
ever-increasing
Sentences

Was
it
necessary
for
judges
to
wear
any
The
so-called
"Fhrer's
decree"
required
judges
to
wear
the
insignia
-
Did
you
wear
such
an
insignia?
I
would
have
been
ashamed
to
wear
it.
-
Did
you
resign
in
1935?
Did
Ernst
Janning
wear
Yes.
That's
all.
Thank
you.
Herr
Rolfe.
Herr
Justizrat
Dr
Wieck.
You
used
the
phrase
"necessary
Would
you
explain
at
the
time
National

What
conditions?
Would
you
say
Yes.
Would
you
say
Yes.
-
Was
there
a
Communist
Party?
Was
it
the
third
largest
party
in
Germany?
Mm...
yes.
Would
you
say
that
National
Socialism
Yes,
but
at
a
terrible
price,
and...
Please,
confine
yourself
Therefore,
was
it
not
possible
and
yet
work
for
what
he
thought
No.
It
was
not
possible.
Dr
Wieck,
you
were
not
in
the
administration
by
your
own
admission.
Is
it
not
possible
that
your
view
No,
it
is
not.
How
can
you
testify
about
events
in
I
had
many
friends
There
were
journals
and
books.
From
journals
and
books?
I
see.
Dr
Wieck,
you
referred
to
"novel
among
them
sexual
sterilisation."
Are
you
aware
that
sexual
sterilisation
but
had
been
advanced
in
dealing
with
the
mentally
Yes,
I
am
aware
of
that.
Are
you
aware
it
has
advocates
among
I
am
not
an
expert
on
such
laws.
Then
permit
me
to
read
one
to
you.
This
is
a
High
Court
opinion
upholding
such
laws
And
I
quote:
"We
have
seen
more
than
once
may
call
upon
"It
would
be
strange
indeed
those
who
already
sap
the
strength
in
order
to
prevent
"It
is
better
if,
instead
of
waiting
to
or
to
let
them
starve
society
can
prevent
their
propagation
"Three
generations
-
Do
you
recognise
it
now,
Dr
Wieck?
Actually,
there
is
since
the
opinion
upholds
the
sterilisation
of
the
United
States,
and
was
written
Supreme
Court
Justice
Now,
Dr
Wieck,
in
view
of
what
you
have
just
learned,
can
you
still
say
that
sexual
sterilisation
Yes,
I
can
say
it,
because
it
was
never
before
used
Do
you
personally
know
of
a
case
where
someone
was
sterilised
-
I
know
that
such
things
were
done.
Please
answer
the
question.
I
don't
know
of
any
specific
case
I
am
asking
if
you
have
any
first-hand,
No,
I
have
no
such
personal
knowledge.
Thank
you.
Dr
Wieck,
you
are
aware
of
the
charges
Yes,
I
am.
Can
you
honestly
say
Yes,
I
can.
Do
you
consider
yourself
Yes,
I
do.
Dr
Wieck,
did
you
ever
swear
to
Your
Honour,
I
object.
The
witness
doesn't
have
to

All

I

many
people
at

you.
You're
good

I

it

for
you,
We
were

No,

were

and
Goebbels
What
was
it
like?
We
never

Never.
I'm
not
trying
to
put
you
on
trial.
I'm
just
curious.
I'd
like
to

Here's
your

You're

Thank
you.
For

there

Did
you

know
We
knew
nothing
about
it.
How
can
you
ask
I'm
sorry.
Your
Honour,
we
are
only
little
people.
We
lost
a
son
in
the
army
and
our
daughter
in
the
bombing.
During
the
war
we
almost
starved.
It
was
terrible
for
us.
I'm
sure
it
was.
Hitler...
I
won't
say
he
didn't
do
some
good
things.
He
built
the
autobahn.
We
won't
say
But
the
other
things...
The
things
they
say
he
did
to
the
Jews
Very
few
Germans
did.
And
if
we
did
know...
what
could
we
do?
But
Mrs
Halbestadt
said
you
didn't
know.
Mrs
Bertholt,
Ah,
Madame
Bertholt
I'm
sure
she
is.
He
was

What
happened
to
him?
He
was

of

The

Uh-huh.
Now,

Do

How

were
you
at
the
time?
Would
you
please
Uh...
some...
Some
SA
men
broke
into
and
they
broke
the
windows
and
the
door.
They
called
us
traitors
and
they
tried
to...
to
beat
up
my
father.
And
what
happened
then?
My
brothers
and
I,
we
went
to
help
him.
And
there
was
a
fight.
Finally
we
got
them
outside
in
the
street
and
we
beat
them
up,
and
turned
them
over
to
the
police.
-
Did
the
police
do
anything
about
it?
Why
not?
It
was
then
at
the
time
-
The
National
Socialists
came
to
power?
Now,
Mr
Petersen,
what
happened
after
1933,
I
got
a
job
on
a
farm,
but
for
the
work,
I
went
to
the
city
building
And
what
happened
there?
They
took
me
to
an
official.
Did
you
ever
have
any
dealings
He
was
one
of
the
men
What
did
he
say
to
your
application?
He
said
an
examination
Where
was
the
examination
to
take
place?
In
the
district
court
of
Stuttgart.
Who
was
the
presiding
justice
Justice
Hofstetter.
Now,
what
happened
in
the
courtroom?
They
asked
me
my
full
name
What
else
did
they
ask
you?
They
asked
me
when
Adolf
Hitler
What
did
you
reply?
I
told
them
I
didn't
know,

Did
they
ask
you
any
more
questions?
No.
They
told
me
that
I
would
be
I
see.
Mr
Petersen,
I'd
like
you
to
look
at
something.
-
Do
you
recognise
it?
Would
you
please
read
it
for
the
tribunal?
"District
court
of
Stuttgart."
"The
baker
Rudolf
Petersen,
son
of
railway
employee
Hans
Petersen,
is
to
be
sterilised."

Would
you
read
"It
is
therefore
requested
to
one
of
the
hospitals
mentioned
below."
"If
he
does
not
betake
himself
voluntarily,
he
will
be
taken
by
force."
Now
please
read
the
signature
"Presiding
Justice
Hofstetter."
Would
you
read
what
is
written
-
Below?
"By
authority
of
Ernst
Janning,
Minister
of
Justice."
Your
Honour,
may

What
did
you
do
after
I
ran
away.
And
did
you
return?
-
Did
I
what?
Yes.
And
what
happened
then?
The
police
came.
The
police
came.
-
Where
did
they
take
you?
Mr
Petersen.
Excuse
me,
I
wonder
To
the
hospital.
-
What
happened
at
the
hospital?
The
nurse
who
was...
Well,
she
came
in
anyway.
She
was
to
prepare
me
for
the
operation.
And
she
said
she
thought
And
then
the
doctor
came
in,
and
he
said
he
thought
it
was
awful.
Were
you
in
fact
sterilised?

That's
all.
Herr
Rolfe.
Mr
Petersen,
you
may
take
your
earphones
off
now,
Mr
Petersen,
you
say
you
work
Yes,
that
is
right.
What
other
occupations
have
you
held?
I
have
worked
for
my
father.
-
What
did
your
father
do?
Yes,
but
what
did
he
do?
He
would
raise
and
lower
the
barrier
And
you
spoke
about
your
brothers.
-
How
many
brothers
do
you
have?
-
And
sisters?
-
Then
you
are
a
family
of
ten?
What
occupations
do
your
brothers
have?
Labourers.
All
labourers?
I
see.
Mr
Petersen,
you
said
the
court
the
birth
dates
of
Hitler
and
Dr
Goebbels.
-
Is
that
correct?
What
else
did
they
ask
you?
Uh...
Nothing
else.

Mr

of

I

easy
I'm
not
used
to
them
being
easy.
I'm
not
fragile,
Judge
Haywood.
I'm
a
daughter
of
the
military.
-
You
know
what
that
means,
don't
you?
It
means
I
was
taught
discipline.
A
very
special
kind
of
discipline.
For
instance,
as
a
child
we
would
go
for
But
I
was
never
allowed
to
run
I
was
told
"Control
your
thirst."
"Control
hunger."
"Control
emotion."
It
has
served
me
well.
And
your
husband?
My
husband
was
a
soldier.
to
fight
in
the
battle
and
fight
well.
-
Is
the
coffee
all
right?
It's
ersatz,
It's
fine.
I'm
curious.
What
do
you
think
of
Ernst
Janning?
Mrs
Bertholt,
I'm
not
at
liberty
to
discuss
Oh,
yes.
Of
course.
I
knew
Ernst
Janning
a
little.
There
was
a
reception
given
Hitler
was
there.
Ernst
Janning
was
there
with
his
wife.
She
was
very
beautiful.
Very
small,
very
delicate.
She's
dead
now.
Hitler
was
quite
taken
with
her.
He
made
advances
towards
her
He
used
to
do
things
like
that
I
will
never
forget
the
way
I
don't
think
anybody
He
said
"Chancellor,
I
do
not
object
"I
do
not
object
to
that
so
much."
"I
object
that
you
are
such
a
bourgeois."
Hitler
whitened,
Is
the
coffee
really
all
right?
Fine,
thank
you.
Men
like
Janning,
my
husband
and
I,
I
want
you
to
know
that.
He
hated
my
husband
and
the
little
corporal
And
he
hated
him
because
he
married
Hitler
was
in
awe
of
the
nobility,
That's
why
it's
so
ironic,
what
happened.
You
know
what
happened
Yes.
What
did
he
know
He
was
placed
on
trial
He
was
part
of
the
revenge
the
victors
It
was
political
murder.
You
can
see
that,
can't
you?
Mrs
Bertholt,
I
don't
know
what
I
see.
I
probably
shouldn't
be
here
I
want
to
understand.
I
have
to.
Would
you
like
some
more
coffee?
Yes,
thank
you.
-
Hi.
We
found
Irene
Hoffman.
-
Where?
Berlin,
eh?
She
got
married.
Her
name
is
Wallner
-
When
is
she
coming?
-
What
do
you
mean,
she's
not
coming?
You
know
what
it's
like.
If
I
catch
the
midnight,
I
can
get
to
Berlin
-
Tad,
you
haven't
slept...
Take
over
for
me
in
court
in
the
morning,

Colonel,
please.
I
have
told
you
this
I
say
it
again
now:
She
does
not
have
to
go.
Mr
Wallner,
I'm
not
ordering
her
to
go.
Do
you
think
we
get
a
medal
The
people
do
not
like
them,
they
do
not
I
haven't
been
prosecuting
these
cases
for
It
is
easy
for
you
to
say
go.
After
the
trials
you
go
back
to
America,
Mr
Wallner,
don't
you
think
How
can
you
come
in
like
the
Gestapo...
Because
they
must
not
be
allowed
Do
you
really
think
I
say
the
hell
with
them
Hugo.
Emil
Hahn
will
be
there?
Yes.
In
the
dock.
Ernst
Janning?
Yes.
You
saw
the
store
downstairs.
It's
not
much,
but
it's
a
new
start
for
us.
They
will
come
if
I
go
to
Nuremberg.
They
will
come
I'll
place
a
guard
in
front
-
You
do
not
have
to
go,
Irene...
You
have
to
go
for
all
the
people
-
You
do
not
owe
it
to
anybody,
Irene.
You
owe
it
to
one
person
at
least.

In
the
night...
every
night...
we've
known
somehow

Dr
Geuter,
Yes,
sir.
Would
you
read
it
to
the
tribunal?
"Death
to
the
race
defiler."
-
In
what
newspaper
did
it
appear?
What
was
it
in
connection
with?
The
Feldenstein
case.
What
was
the
Feldenstein
case?
Your
Honour!
The
defence
objects
It
is
a
notorious
case,
It
has
overtones
and
appeals
to
emotion
There
are
no
issues
or
overtones
The
tribunal
is
interested
in
everything
It's
all
right.
I'll
take
it.
-
May
it
please
the
tribunal?
Thank
you.
Now,
what
was
the
Feldenstein
case?
The
case
of
a
man
Will
you
explain
what
is
meant
This
is
the
charge
that
is
Any
non-Aryan
having
sexual
relations
When
did
you
first
become
acquainted
In
September
1935
They
said
that
Mr
Feldenstein
and
that
he
requested
What
position
did
he
hold
He
was
a
very
well-known
merchant.
He
was
one
of
the
heads
of
What
was
the
nature
He
was
accused
with
a
16-year-old
girl,
Irene
Hoffman.

I
see.
And
what
did
he
say
He
said
it
was
false.
He
said
he
knew
the
girl
He'd
gone
to
visit
her
since
they
died.
But
there
had
never
been
anything
Doctor,
would
you
please
tell
He
was
indicted
before

Where
was
this
special
court?
It
was
right
here.
This
building.
Dr
Geuter,
what
were
the
circumstances
It
was
used
as
a
showplace
It
was
the
time
of
the
September
The
courtroom
was
crowded.
Back
there,
people
were
standing
up.
Julius
Streicher
was
sitting
And
high
officials
of
Doctor,
would
you
please
tell
us
what
were
your
expectations
I
expected
the
worst
when
I
saw
that
Emil
Hahn
He
was
a
fanatic.
His
trials
were
always
But
I
had
one
hope
for
the
outcome,
because
sitting
on
the
judge's
bench
His
reputation
was
known
He
was
known
to
have
to
the
concept
of
justice.
Thank
you.
That's
all.

Any
questions?
Thank
you.
No
questions.

The
witness
is
excused.
The
prosecution
calls
to
the
stand
Will
you
raise
your
right
hand?

swear
by
God
the
Almighty
that
I
will
speak
the
pure
truth
I
do.
Will
you
please
state
your
name
Irene
Hoffman
Wallner.
Mrs
Wallner,
Yes.
When
did
you
first
meet
him?
It
was
1925
or
1926.
-
How
old
was
he
at
this
time?
And
how
old
was
he
-
He
was
65.
What
was
the
nature
of
your
relationship?
We
were
friends.
Did
you
continue
to
see
him
-
Yes.
We
were
friends.
His
business
took
him
there
quite
often.
Now,
what
did
you
say
to
the
police
when
they
questioned
you
about
having
I
told
them
it
was
a
lie.
Could
you
tell
me
Emil
Hahn.
-
Did
Emil
Hahn
question
you?
What
did
he
say
to
you?
He...
took
me
into
a
separate
room
where
we
were
alone.
He
told
me
that
it
was
no
use
because
no
one
would
believe
me.
That
there
had
been
race
defilement,
and
the
only
pardon
for
this
He
told
me
that
that
I
would
be
held
What
did
you
reply
to
him?
I
told
him
what
I
had
said,
I
told
him
that
I
could
not
I
could
not
lie
about
someone
Were
you
held
under
arrest?
Yes.
Mrs
Wallner,
tell
us,
what
was
the
manner
in
which
He
made
a
mockery
of
everything
Mr
Feldenstein
He
held
him
up
to
ridicule
What
was
the
reaction
of
the
audience?
They
laughed
again
and
again.
How
long
did
the
trial
last?
Mrs
Wallner?
How
long
did
the
trial
last?
Two
days.
Was
the
verdict
passed
Yes.
-
What
was
the
verdict?
And
what
was
the
sentence?
Mr
Feldenstein
was
sentenced
I
was
sentenced
to
be
in
prison
Who
was
the
presiding
judge?
Ernst
Janning.
Were
the
sentences
carried
out?
Thank
you
very
much,
Mrs
Wallner.
Any
questions?
Your
Honour,
I
would
like
to
request
We
will
present
further
evidence
when
it
comes
time
The
witness
will
please
You
may
go.
You're
excused
now.

Colonel
Lawson.
Your
Honours,
I

and
put
into

Your
Honours,
I
would
like
to
request
that
-
Granted.
Will
you
raise
your
right
hand?
I
swear
by
God
that
I
will
speak
the
pure
truth
I
do.
Were
you
active
in
the
United
States
Yes,
I
was.
Were
you
in

I
was.

Were
you

There
are
things

husband
was
a
military
man
He
was
entitled

soldier's
death.
I
tried
to
get
that
for
him.
Just
that,
I
went
from
official

he
should
be
permitted

know

happened.
He
was

never
left

hated
with

can't
live

hate.

know

May
it
please
the
tribunal.
Yesterday
the
tribunal
They
were...
shocking
films.
Devastating
films.
As
a
German,
I
feel
ashamed
that
such
things
There
can
never
be
not
in
generations,
not
in
centuries.
But...
I
do
think
it
was
wrong,
indecent
and
terribly
unfair
of
the
prosecution
to
show
such
films
in
this
case,
against
these
defendants!
And
I
cannot
protest
too
strongly
What
is
the
prosecution
trying
to
prove?
That
the
German
people
as
a
whole
Or
that
they
were
even
aware
of
them?
Because,
if
he
is,
he's
not
stating
facts
and
he
knows
he's
not.
The
secrecy
of
the
operations,
the
geographical
location
of
the
camps,
the
breakdown
of
communications
when
the
exterminations
show
only
too
clearly
The
truth
is
that
these
brutalities
The
criminals.
Very
few
Germans
knew
Very
few.
None
of
us
knew
what
was
happening
None
of
us.
But
the
most
ironic
part
of
it
is
that
the
prosecution
showed
men
who
stayed
in
power
To
prevent
worse
things
from
happening.
Who
is
the
braver
man?
The
man
who
escapes
Or
the
man
who
stays
on
his
post

what
has

in

only
one
tangible
piece
of

Is
it

true
that

What

Do
you
think
I
have
enjoyed

There
were
things
I
had
to
do
Why
did
I
do
them?
Because
I
want
to
leave
I
want
to
leave
them
a
shred
of
dignity.
I
want
to
call
a
halt
to
these

If
we
allow
them
to
discredit
we
lose
the
right
to
rule
ourselves
forever!
We
have
to
look
at
the

Nothing.

about

General?
We're
committed
to

happen
if

We'll
have
to
face
that
when
it
happens.
You
should
try
the
strudel.
No,
thanks.
Dan,
I've
just
come
back
I
don't
think
this
is
going
to
be
it.
But
it
is
going
to
be
a
fight
for
survival
-
Germany
is
the
key
to
that
survival.
Any
high-school
student
Just
what
are
you
trying
to
say,
Senator?
What
I'm
trying
to
say
is
this:
While
nobody's
trying
it's
important
that
you
realise
this
Let's
face
it,
gentlemen,
We're
going
to
need
We're
going
to
need
More
strudel,
gentlemen?
Herr
Janning,
you
may
proceed.
I
wish
to
testify
because
it
was
the
most
significant
It
is
important
not
only
but
for
the
whole
German
people.
But
in
order
to
understand
it,
one
must
understand
There
was
a
fever
over
the
land.
A
fever
of
disgrace,
We
had
a
democracy,
yes,
but
it
was
torn
by
elements
within.
Above
all,
there
was
fear.
Fear
of
today,
fear
of
tomorrow,
fear
of
our
neighbours,
and
fear
of
ourselves.
Only
when
you
understand
that
can
you
understand
Because
he
said
to
us:
"Lift
your
heads.
"There
are
devils
among
us
-
"Once
these
devils
will
be
destroyed,
It
was
the
old,
old
story
What
about
those
of
us
who
knew
better?
We
who
knew
the
words
were
lies
Why
did
we
sit
silent?
Because
we
loved
our
country.
What
difference
does
it
make
if
a
few
What
difference
does
it
make
if
a
few
It
is
only
a
passing
phase.
It
is
only
a
stage
we
are
going
through.
It
will
be
discarded
sooner
or
later.
Hitler
himself
will
be
discarded
"The
country
is
in
danger!
"We
will
go
forward."
And
history
tells
We
succeeded
beyond
The
very
elements
of
hate
and
power
mesmerised
the
world!
We
found
ourselves
Things
that
had
been
denied
to
us
The
world
said
"Take
Sudetenland.
"Take
all
of
Austria!
Take
it."
And
then
one
day
we
looked
around
and
found
that
we
were
The
ritual
began
in
this
courtroom,
swept
over
the
land
What
was
going
to
be
a
passing
phase
had
become
the
way
of
life.
Your
Honour,
I
was
content
to
sit
silent
I
was
content
to
tend
my
roses.
I
was
even
content
until
I
realised
that
in
order
to
save
it
he
would
have
to
raise
the
spectre
again.
You
have
seen
him
do
it.
He
has
done
it
here
in
this
courtroom.
He
has
suggested
that
the
Third
Reich
He
has
suggested
that
we
sterilised
men
He
suggested
that
perhaps
the
old
Jew
Once
more,
it
is
being
done
It
is
not
easy
to
tell
the
truth.
But
if
there
is
to
be
we
who
know
our
guilt
must
admit
it,
whatever
the
pain
and
humiliation.
I
had
reached
my
verdict
before
I
ever
came
into
the
courtroom.
I
would
have
found
him
guilty
whatever
It
was
a
sacrificial
ritual,
and
Feldenstein
Your
Honour,
the
defendant
He
is
not
aware
of
the
implications.
I
am
aware.
I
am
aware!
My
counsel
would
have
you
believe
we
were
not
aware
Not
aware.
Where
were
we?
Where
were
we
when
Hitler
began
When
our
neighbours
were
dragged
out
Where
were
we
when
every
village
where
cattle
cars
were
filled
with
children
Where
were
we
when
they
cried
out
Were
we
deaf?
Dumb?
Blind?
Your
Honour,
I
must
protest.
My
counsel
says
we
were
not
aware
He
would
give
you
the
excuse
we
were
only
aware
Does
that
make
us
any
the
less
guilty?
Maybe
we
didn't
know
the
details,
but
if
we
didn't
know,
-
Traitor!
Traitor!
Order!
Put
that

back
in
his

am
going

Werner

an
old
man
An

man
who
profited
of
every
man
he
sent
Friedrich
Hofstetter,
the
good
German,
who
sent
men
before
him
to
be
sterilised,
Emil

the
decayed,
corrupt
bigot,
obsessed
by
the
evil
within
himself.
And
Ernst

worse
than
any
of

because
he
knew
what
they
were,
and
he
went
along
with
them.
Ernst
Janning,
who
made
his
life...
excrement...
because
he
walked
with
them.
Your
Honour,
it
is
my
duty
to
defend
Ernst
Janning,
and
yet
Ernst
Janning
There
is
no
doubt
he
feels
his
guilt.
He
made
a
great
error
hoping
it
would
be
good
for
his
country.
But,
if
he
is
to
be
found
guilty,
there
are
others
who
also
went
along,
who
also
must
be
found
guilty.
Ernst
Janning
said
"We
succeeded
Why
did
we
succeed,
Your
Honour?
What
about
the
rest
of
the
world?
Did
it
not
know
Did
it
not
hear
the
words
of
Hitler
Did
it
not
read
his
intentions
published
in
every
corner
of
the
world?
Where
is
the
responsibility
who
signed
in
1939
the
pact
with
Hitler
Are
we
now
to
find
Russia
guilty?
Where
is
the
responsibility
who
signed
in
1933
giving
him
his
first
tremendous
prestige?
Are
we
now
to
find
the
Vatican
guilty?
Where
is
the
responsibility
who

in
an
open
letter
1938,
Your
Honour

"Were
England
to
suffer
national
disaster,
to
send
a
man

the
strength

Where
is
the
responsibility

helped
Hitler
and
profited
by
that
rebuilding?
Are
we
now
to
find
No,
Your
Honour.
No.
Germany
alone
is
not
guilty.
The
whole
world
is
as
responsible
It
is
an
easy
thing
It
is
easy
to
speak
of
that
allowed
Hitler
to
rise
to
power,
and
at
the
same
time
that
made
the
Russians
sign
pacts
American
industrialists
profit
by
him!
Ernst
Janning
said
he
is
guilty.
If
he
is,
Ernst
Janning's
guilt
No
more
and
no
less.

you

That's
why
I
called
you

are
you

you
want
to
do

You

Yeah,
I
know
what's
going
on.
You're

may
not,
but
you
do.
I
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
I
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen.
But
if
I
do
know
this:
If
Germany
goes,
Europe
goes.
That's
the
way
things
stand.
Look,
Matt.
I'm
going
to
go
the
limit.
And
not
you,
not

Who
do
you
think
you're
talking
to?
Who
the
hell
do
you
think
When
you
were
marching
into
Dachau,
You
think
I'll
ever
forget
it?
I'm
not
your
commanding
officer.
But
I
want
to
give
this
to
you,
We
need
the
help
of
the
German
people.
You
don't
get
their
help
by
sentencing
Tad,
the
thing
to
do
is
survive,
isn't
it?
Survive
as
best
we
can,
but
survive.
Just
for
laughs,
Matt.
What
was
the
war
all
about?
What
was
it
about?
That
concludes
presentation
against
these
defendants.
Your
Honours,
during
the
three
years
that
have
passed
mankind
has
not
crossed
In
our
own
country,
and
we
must
look
once
more
There's
talk
of
cold
war
and
the
echoes
of
persecution
These
events
cannot
help
but
colour
But
somewhere
the
responsibility
for
the
crimes
must
be
placed
in
true
perspective.
And
this
is
the
decision
It
is
the
dilemma
of
our
times.
It
is
a
dilemma
that
rests
with
you.
The
prosecution
rests.

was
fighting
for
its
life.
Certain
measures
were
needed
I
cannot
say
that
I
am
sorry

for
their
actions.
Men
who
sat
in
black
robes,
in
judgment
on
other
men.
Men
who
took
part
the
purpose
of
which
was
Men
who,
in
executive
positions,
actively
participated
illegal
even
under
German
law.
The
principle
of
criminal
law
has
this
in
common:
Any
person
who
sways
any
person
who
furnishes
the
lethal
any
person
who
is
is
guilty.
Herr
Rolfe
further
asserts
was
an
extraordinary
jurist
and
acted
in
what
he
thought
There
is
truth
in
this
also.
Janning,
to
be
sure,
is
a
tragic
figure.
We
believe
he
loathed
the
evil
he
did.
But
compassion
for
must
not
beget
forgetfulness
of
the
torture
and
the
death
of
millions
Janning's
record
and
his
fate
that
has
emerged
from
this
trial.
If
he,
and
all
of
the
other
defendants,
if
all
of
the
leaders
of
the
Third
Reich
then
these
events
would
have
than
an
earthquake,
But
this
trial
has
shown
ordinary,
even
able
can
delude
themselves
so
vast
and
heinous
No
one
who
has
sat
through
Men
sterilised
because
of
political
belief.
A
mockery
made
of
friendship
and
faith.
The
murder
of
children.
How
easily
it
can
happen.
There
are
those
in
our
own
country
too
who
today
speak
of
the
protection
A
decision
must
be
made
At
the
very
moment
when
the
grasp
then
it
seems
that
the
only
way
to
survive
to
rest
survival
upon
what
is
expedient,
to
look
the
other
way.
Well,
the
answer
to
that
is...
A
country
isn't
a
rock.
It's
not
an
extension
of
one's
self.
It's
what
it
stands
for.
It's
what
it
stands
for
when
standing
Before
the
people
of
the
world,
let
it
now
be
noted
that
here,
Justice,
truth...
and
the
value
of
a
single
human
being.
The
marshal
will
produce
before
Emil
Hahn,
the
tribunal
finds
you
guilty
Today
you
sentence
me.
The
marshal
will
produce
the
defendant
Friedrich
Hofstetter,
the
tribunal
finds
you
guilty
The
marshal
will
produce
Werner
Lampe,
the
tribunal
finds
you
guilty


The
marshal
will
produce
the
defendant
Ernst
Janning,
the
tribunal
finds
you
guilty
He
doesn't
understand.
He
just
doesn't
understand.
He
understands.

Justice
Ives
dissenting.
I
wish
to
point
out
strongly
my
dissenting
as
stated
by
Justice
Haywood,
The
issue
of
the
actions
of
the
defendants,
who
believed
they
were
acting
is
an
issue
that
cannot
It
can
only
be
decided
objectively,
in
years
to
come,
Where
shall
I
put
these
books,
Put
them
in
the
trunk,
Mr
Halbestadt.
Your
Honour,
here's
something
Oh,
no.
If
you
give
me
any
more
food,
But
it's
strudel,
the
way
you
like
it.
-
Thank
you.
Thank
you
for
everything.
-
I'll
put
it
in
the
car.
Tickets,
passport,
immunisation.
See
you
there
no
later
than
three
o'clock.
Oh,
and
give
my
regards
to
Miss...
Scheffler.
Elsa.
-
That's
one
you
owe
me.
Americans
aren't
very
popular



-
Good
afternoon,
Your
Honour.
I
came
here
at
the
request
He
wishes
to
see
you.
I'm
just
leaving
for
the
airport.
He
says
it
would
Have
you
heard
about
Most
of
them
were
acquitted.
-
The
verdict
came
in
today.
I
will
make
you
a
wager.
I
don't
make
wagers.
A
gentlemen's
wager.
In
five
years,
the
men
you
sentenced
Herr
Rolfe,
I
have
admired
your
work
You
are
particularly
brilliant
So,
what
you
suggest
It
is
logical,
in
view
But
to
be
logical
is
not
to
be
right.
And
nothing
on
God's
earth
Someone
to
see
you.
Herr
Janning.
Judge
Haywood.
Please,
sit
down.
Thank
you.
You
wanted
to
see
me.
Yes.
There
is
something
A
record.
A
record
of
my
cases,
I
want
to
give
them
someone
I
felt
I
got
to
know
Thank
you.
I'll
take
good
care
of
them.
I
know
the
pressures
You
will
be
criticised
greatly.
Your
decision
will
not
be
a
popular
one.
But,
if
it
means
anything
to
you,
you
have
the
respect
By
all
that
is
right
in
this
world,
Thank
you.
What
you
said
in
the
courtroom,
Judge
Haywood...
The
reason
I
asked
you
to
come...
Those
people,
those
millions
of
people,
I
never
knew
it
would
come
to
that.
You
must
believe
it.
Herr
Janning,
it
came
to
that
the
first
time
you
sentenced
a
man
