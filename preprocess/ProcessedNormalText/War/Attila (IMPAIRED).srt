Though
decadent
and
corrupt,
the
Roman
Empire
remained
Then
a
new
people,
the
Huns,
appeared
from
the
east.
An
ancient
prophecy
told
of
a
man
and
challenge
Rome
-
My
arrow
fell
short!
The
deer
outruns
it.
Perhaps
it's
time
We're
on
Dunnotis'
land.
The
chase
was
long.
We'll
send
him
Still,
we
might
have
been
seen.
If
Dunnotis
complains,
we
kill
him.
Hush,
boy.
It's
foolish
for
Huns
How
can
we
conquer
the
western
lands
Father
spoke
of
the
western
lands
He
was
there
once,
Did
he
discover
them?
No,
no...
Others
discovered
them
How?
A
gadfly.
A
warrior
was
taming
a
stallion,
and
a
gadfly
bit
the
stallion
The
warrior
followed
But
there's
no
way
past
the
marsh.
Oh,
the
horse
found
a
way,
-
and
on
the
other
side...
Father
says
we'll
conquer
them.
-
When
the
Great
King
comes.
The
Great
King
and
all
men
will
kneel
to
him.
He
will
rule
the
Hun
as
one
nation,
and
hold
the
sword
of
the
war
god
And...he'll
go
to
bed
Yes,
Father.

No!
Attila,
stop!
-
I
want
to
help!
Let
me
help!
You
stay
in
there.
Father!
Father.
Father...
Get
him!
You
are
Mundzuk's
son.
Where
is
my
grandmother?
She
is
dead.
Your
father
is
dead.
That's
his
reward
I
am
your
master
now.
Kneel.
Kneel!
And
I
might
let
you
live
as
my
slave.
Hyah!
Hyah!
What's
your
name,
boy?
Attila,
son
of
Mundzuk.
Don't
you
recognize
me?
I
am
Rua,
your
father's
brother,
and
it's
a
long
time
-
My
father's
dead.
You've
been
alone
all
this
time?
You're
safe
now.
Come.
Unless
you
prefer


The
wolverine,
the
sheba,
and
the
horse,
-
How
many
layers
in
a
bow?
How
long
must
you
heat
Until
the
outer
layer
sweats.
You've
been
taught
well.
Go
to
your
tent.
He
doesn't
belong
here.
I
took
my
brother's
wife
Should
I
leave
the
younger
Yes.
Yes,
for
Bleda's
sake.
He's
the
elder.
He'll
get
the
larger
portion
There
will
be
trouble
between
them.
Who's
there?
Who
are
you?
-
Who
are
you?
-
I
am
Galen.
-
A
girl.
Are
you
blind?
-
I'm
no
older
than
you.
They're
afraid
of
me.
Why
are
they
afraid
of
you?
Because
I
read
the
stars
and
the
sky
You're
a
witch.
I
had
a
vision
yesterday
-
Who?
Stay
back.
No.
You
were
born
yesterday,
Ah,
yes.
Yesterday,
on
the
steppes.

Some
say
it
takes
months
But...it
takes
15
years.
It
starts
when
the
tree
You
cut
the
wood
too
soon,
too
late,
it
becomes
brittle.
King
Rua...
We
found
them.
Are
these
the
men

They're
yours.
You
do
with
them
what
you
will.
-
There
were
more
of
them.
-
Kneel.
Submit
to
me
and
live.
Attila!
They
saw
no
force
of
any
kind
Good.
IMPERIAL
PRISON
You
should
be
used
to
it
by
now.
We
guards
eat
the
same
food.
It's
slave
food.
Only
a
slave
could
get
used
to
it.
Aaargh!
I
am
Flavius
Aetius.
Rome
endures.
I
will
endure.

Parthians,
Scythians,
Macedonians,
Picts,
Gauls,
Britons,
The
list
of
defeated
peoples
-
Why
are
Huns
different?
-
Wait
till
they
face
Roman
troops.
From
the
Eastern
Empire.
-
We
have
no
troops
near
the
border.
Not
possible.
Is
it
serious?
The
Huns
-
They've
crossed
into
our
territory.
And
when
they
realize
how
little
Placidia,
one
man
Aetius
will
not
leave
prison
alive.
He
knows
their
customs,
I
said
no.

Felix,
I
know
my
son
is...
immature,
but
he
is
learning.
He's
emperor
now,
and
he'll
rise
to
the
occasion
There!
I
did
it!
What
shall
I
hit?
Idiot!
He's
ruined
my
shot!
I'll
think
about
what
you
said,
but
I
have
to
be
convinced
that


Invaders!
Invaders!



Go!
Get
moving!
Wait!
Your
name?
N'Kara.
You
fight
bravely.
Put
her
with
the
slaves.
Her
sword
was
the
bloodiest
of
all.
If
she
has
kin,
spare
them
as
well.

You
may
leave.
I
once
swore
you'd
never
but
your
friends
have
In
the
light
of
their
plea...

There's
only
one
conceivable
-
You
need
me.
If
I
had
to
guess,
and
you
and
the
rest
of
Rome
There
have
been
reports
among
the
southern
tribes
-
Attila.
No,
but
I
know
King
Rua,
My
son
is
young.
He
needs
someone
You
can
serve
your
country
-
if
that's
possible.
What's
your
price?
First,
a
full
pardon.
You
tried
to
depose
me,
before
Let's
call
that
a
misunderstanding.
What
else?
Full
restoration
of
my
estates,
personal
staff,
hand-picked
by
me,
and...
reinstatement
to
the
rank
If
I
am
to
deal
with
the
Huns,
-
Felix
has
the
supreme
command.
-
He
recommended
your
release.
-
You
can
rot
in
this
cell
forever.
You
can
find
someone
else
Warden.
Release
him.
He
is
your
new
supreme
commander.
The
guard
who
brought
me
Petronius,
my
lord.
-
Father!
Oh,
you're
really
free!
Oh,
I
was
afraid
to
believe
it.
I
came
to
the
prison
My
God,
look
at
you.
You're
a
young
woman,
The
villa's
really
ours
again?
Yes.
And
the
one
in
Sicily
too.
Tomorrow
I'll
bring
in
workers.
It'll
be
as
beautiful
as
ever.

Come
on,
move!
Ha,
ha,
you're
in
my
lot
now!

King
Rua,
I
bring
you
tribute
from
our
victory.

A
victory
over
farmers?
The
people
are
watching.
You
are
brothers!
Let
us
see
the
treasures
Attila,
don't
let
your
brother's

He's
right.
It
was
a
village
defended
We
fight
peasants
Yes.
Not
even
the
Romans.
-
Rome?
That's
a
different
matter.
True.
But,
uh,
why
wake
a
sleeping
lion?
We
were
50
leagues
There
were
no
legions,
Let
me
take
a
larger
army
-
How
much
further?
What
will
you
do
when
you
get
there?
They're
wide
as
wagons,
but
they're
made
of
stone,

I
scared
you.
-
I
could
have
killed
you.
-
Nothing.
-
You
did,
didn't
you?
Did
you
have
another
vision
-
Maybe.
What
did
you
bring
me?
That
vision
has
been
in
our
tribe
After
a
hard
battle,
His
sword
dropped
from
his
hand.
Whoever
finds
it
will
rule
the
world.
You
must
believe
it,
Attila.
Why?
Because
when
you're
A
handle
of
gold
and
ivory,
I
won't
even
rule
the
tribe.
When
my
uncle
dies,
Bleda's
not
in
my
visions.
You
are.
Go
away,
woman!
Leave
me
alone.
To
think
of
the
red-haired
woman.
The
whole
tribe
knows.
A
red-haired
woman
A
red-haired
woman
has
caught...

Tonight
we
celebrate
the
first
with
Roman
spoils.

Bleda,
as
the
eldest,
Choose
wisely.
Attila,
your
raid
and
I
commend
you.
Since
I
did
not
fight,
I
claim
nothing
of
value.
Only...
an
animal,
unknown
in
these
parts.
A
strange
creature

Bring
it
in.
Later
tonight,
Huns
with
red
hair.

Attila,
what
are
you
doing?
You
can't
kill
Bleda.
You
can't!
Not
in
Rua's
tent,
but
when
he
comes
out,
No.
Your
time
has
not
yet
come.
This
morning
I
had
another
vision.
Destiny
has
chosen
you,
I'm
tired
of
your
visions!
No!
I
won't
let
you.

A
woman.
Hey,
Galen.
If
you
fight
with
Bleda
over
a
woman,
Even
if
you
win,
you
lose.
Go
back
to
Rua's
tent,
claim
the
conquered
village.
-
Am
I
a
farmer,
that
I
need
land?
It
was
in
my
vision.
Next!
The
horse
shied.
You
and
your
horse
are
one.
His
mistake
is
your
mistake.

The
beast
with
red
fur.
The
toadstool
who
talks.
Bleda
mounts
you
It
is
no
choice
of
mine.
Then
why
don't
you?
My
sister
and
mother.
If
I
kill
myself,
They
live
because
of
Attila.
I've
seen
the
way
he
looks
at
you,
I
belong
to
Bleda.
A
Hun
doesn't
possess
a
woman
If
you
bear
Bleda's,
And
how
can
I
help
it?
These
seeds.
They
will
keep
Attila
or
Bleda?
Bleda
or
Attila?
I
know
who
Galen
would
choose.
We
don't
even
know
Trust
me,
they
will.
I
lived
among
them
when
I
was
young.
How
did
that
happen?
There
was
a
treaty,
They
are
brave,
strong,
Is
it
true
their
women
They
crossed
the
border
They
sacked
20
villages.
As
I
told
Felix,
we
should
And
as
he
told
you,
If
we
pull
legions
from
the
west,
The
Huns
have
violated
and
therefore
The
insult
must
be
avenged.
It
was
the
Huns
that
drove
the
Goths
And
split
the
empire.
That's
why
I
rule
the
West
Yet
your
divine
brain
What
we
must
avoid
at
all
costs
is

Mmm!
Traitor.
I'm
your
sister.
You
wanted
to
be
kissed.
Flavius
Aetius.
The
divine
Honoria.
I
hope
you're
If
you
don't,
Mummy
said
Forever.
Mummy
will
have
her
joke.
-
Shall
we
continue,
divine
one?
Pritella's
daughters
We'll
finish
later.
I
have
to
talk
with
Mummy,
anyway.
I...command
it.

Goodbye,
Mummy.
Where
is
my
son
going?
To
the
Forum.
He
needs
rest
-
But
he
is
progressing?
Nevertheless,
whatever
steps
After
he
obtains
your
approval.
Some
things
need
immediate
attention.
Training
of
troops,
See
to
that
on
your
own.
-
It
would
help
if
I
had
your
seal.
Three
years
in
prison
I
need
proof
The
Huns
are
at
our
border,
Placidia.
We
must
both
forget
old
hatreds.

Petronius...
Don't
worry.

I
beg
you,
I
was
not
well
in
the
head.
How
does
your
head
feel
now?
Ready
for
whatever
service
Good.
I
require
you
to
kill
someone.
Who
is
it,
my
lord?
The
Emperor
Valentinian.
It's
all
arranged.
You'll
be
gone
Ten
gold
talents
now,
A
fortune.
-
I'll
be
a
hunted
man
forever.
The
Emperor's
mother
herself
She's
tasted
power.
Her
seal.
She
gave
it
to
me
for
this
purpose.
If
you're
taken,
Tomorrow
noon,
the
Garden
of
Corona.
Use
the
south
gate.
I'll
see
that
he's
alone.
Who
are
you?
Halt.
How
dare
you
raise
a
weapon
I
was
walking
by.
Thank
God
I
followed
him!
I
had
an
invitation
from
Mummy
See
if
you
can
find
out
who
he
is.
He
carries
my
mother's
seal.
How
is
that
possible?
She
invited
me
here...to
be
killed.
No.
Your
own
mother?
I
should
have
known!
All
this
talk
was
just
to
keep
me
off
guard!
I'll
have
that
bitch
boiled
alive.
No,
no,
no.
Sire.
-
You
have
no
proof.
She'll
say
it
was
stolen
She'll
have
an
explanation.
Yes.
You've
been
-
All
those
years
in
prison.
Rome
is,
and
you
are
Rome.
Act
wisely.
-
What
must
I
do?
When
she
finds
out
her
scheme
We'll
take
care
of
her
I
put
myself
in
your
hands.
Attila,
walk
with
Galen
I'm
tired.
A
short
walk
with
your
friend.

Woman...
Where
are
you?
Don't
be
afraid.
I'm
not
afraid.
Go
back.
If
my
brother
misses
you,
I
don't
care.
Go
back.

Valentinian,
A
great
city,
a
great
country.
Rome
is
a
fire...
a
golden
flame
of
power,
of
majesty,
beauty,
knowledge.
For
a
thousand
years,
Go
outside.
Look
around
you.
The
Colosseum,
the
Senate,
that
bring
water
from
100
miles
away
so
we
can
live
like
civilized
Of
course,
you're
saying
and
we
have
to
keep
it
that
way.
That's
right.
Tomorrow,
I'll
go
to
Ravenna
and
It's
two
weeks'
march
I'll
need
Senate
approval
tonight.
-
Tonight?
They're
all
asleep.
Wake
them
up.
Yes!
I
will
enjoy
that.
Darling,
I
haven't
seen
you
all
day.
Valentinian?
Thank
you.
It's
proved
very
useful.
Attila,
you
still
want
to
go
to
Rome?
If
you're
serious,
yes.
I'm
serious.
Then
again,
perhaps
you
I
received
a
message.
It
seems
that
Rome
We
know
of
your
incursion
Officially,
I
protest.
Our
spies
bring
word
that
-
Which
tribe?
Why
not
march
your
legion
there?
For
your
sake,
Rua,
Our
spies
tell
us
the
Visigoths
They've
been
paying
tribute
-
Ten
years.

And
they
hate
you
for
it.
Just
as
they
hate
us.
They'll
attack
then
us
while
we
sit
here
He
is
of
your
tribe?
The
Visigoths
tortured
him.
My
spies
saw
it.
Knowing
the
horse
they
carved
ten
horses
into
his
body
one
for
each
year
of
tribute.
It
took
him
three
days
to
die!

There
should
be
more
blood.
These
wounds
were
made
after
death.
A
Roman
general
has
better
things
You've
grown
soft.
The
Huns
I
knew
I
came
to
offer
an
alliance.
I'll
march
Flavius!
We,
uh,
divide
the
spoils
equally?
Of
course.
We'll
join
you.

Make
preparations,
now!
Who
was
the
outspoken
one?
My
nephew,
Attila.
Attila?
I've
heard
of
him.
Yes.
He's
very
ambitious.
Why,
the
other
day,
Did
he?
I
raised
him
and
his
brother
They
hated
each
other
There
is
the
source

A
slave
girl?

Bleda
claimed
her
If
they
don't
fight
over
her,
Why
not
put
Attila
under
my
command?
You'd
have
peace
for
a
time,
They
march
well,
but
can
they
fight?
I
sense
you'd
rather
fight
I've
seen
much
Roman
arrogance

Sentries
are
set,
General.
The

Wake
the
camp
We'll
occupy
the
rise
at
dawn.
-
The
Huns
will
cut
off
any
retreat.
The
dead
man
in
Rua's
tent...
The
Visigoths
And
you
handled
it
very
badly.
You
should
have
waited
and
you
should
have
seemed
puzzled.
"If
he
were
tortured
while
alive,
Rua
realizes
the
answer
for
himself
Trickery
and
deceit...
That's
the
way
of
the
Romans,
Which
way
rules
the
world?
A
Frankish
tribe
must
have
-
We've
just
seen
their
standards.
Their
numbers
have
doubled.
-
Everything
is
ready?
-
They
have
the
high
ground.
But
have
they
realized
yet
At
the
first
trumpet,
the
center
The
second,
they
turn
and
fight.
The
third,
Yes,
General.
Take
the
message
to
Attila.
Yes,
General.
Prepare
for
the
charge.

Sound
the
first
trumpet.

They're
retreating.
Roman
cowards.
No.
It's
a
trick.
Sound
the
second
trumpet.


The
courier
was
killed.
-
His
body
was
found
a
furlong
away.
I
did.
But
he
He'll
expect
us
to
attack
the
flank.
He
sent
no
orders.
Attack
on
my
signal.
Go!
Go!

With
a
few
more
like
him,
Rome
could
Theodoric.
It's
been
a
long
time,
But
the
same
result
-
-
Your
terms?
2,000lbs
of
gold,
Do
you
mean
to
starve
us?
Would
you
prefer
my
legions
You
would
never
dare
Do
you
accept
the
terms,
I
accept
the
terms.
Aetius.
The
girl
is
well?
I
told
you
before.
Lydia
is
no
concern
You
knew
each
other
from
before?
Theodoric?
Yes,
our
paths
have
crossed.

You
hate
each
other.
Strange
as
it
may
seem,
we
She
died
years
ago.
He
blames
me.
So
this
fight
was
for
Rome...
I
strive
for
efficiency.
You
Romans
play
with
kings
and

I
go
back
to
Rome
soon.
Come
with
me.
Learn
how
the
world
is
ruled.
See
if
Rome
really
does

There's
no
one
like
you
in
Rome
Today
was
just
the
beginning.
We
could
do
great
things
If
we
don't
kill
each
other
first.
What
do
you
say,
Attila?

Aetius,
we
congratulate
you
The
glory
is
yours,
Caesar.
I
present
Attila,
whose
courage
and
skill
contributed
Attila,
we
welcome
you
Let
me
introduce
you
Gentlemen,
this
is
Attila.
He's
quite
striking,
His
clothes
are
made
of
animal
skins.
He'll
have
them
off
soon
enough.
Was
it
wise
to
bring
him
here?

One
day
he'll
be
king
Then
we
should
kill
him.
Then
we'd
be
at
war
with
the
Huns,
-
Won't
his
elder
brother
be
king?
Therefore,
we'll
seduce
him
with
And
at
the
end
-
if
he
turns
against
us...
It
will
be
on
your
head,
Aetius.
Grachia,
congratulations
Kind
of
Your
Grace
to
take
note.
Grachia
is
the
current
champion
-
Finest
charioteer
in
the
empire.
I'll
make
sure
you
have
A
chariot
driver
at
a
royal
banquet?
It's
shameful
how
this
city
Some
of
them
It
suits
you
nicely.
I
wear
it
tonight
only.
-
I
have
another
present.
I
insist.
What
is
this
place?
A
bath.
Go
on,
step
in.
You've
never
seen
one?
Aetius
has
only
shown
you
but
I
think
the
bath
It's
hot.
Yes.
That's
the
point.
How's
it
done?
A
furnace,
a
few
pipes.
It
doesn't
matter.
It's
very
soothing
I
had
a
feeling
you
might
like
it.
I'm
not
as
stupid
as
people
think...
as
you
probably
think.
It's
just
that
brains
don't
Mummy's
an
exception.
She
had
real
power.
But
she's
made
sure
She
favors
my
brother
and
has
done
He's
a
hopeless
ninny,
So
that's
that.
I
say,
if
a
woman
can
only
then
let
it
be
with
the
most
-

Rua
grows
old.
He
likes
to
drink
ale
Put
this
in
the
bowl
He
will
die
peacefully,
I
was
afraid
you
weren't
coming.
I
have
other
things
I
need
mushrooms
for
my
potions.
Besides,
Bleda
hardly
Galen,
wait.
He's
planning
to
have
Rua
murdered.
Be
quiet!
You
could
be
killed
Bleda
bribed
a
guard
to
poison
him.
You
have
to
do
something.
-
What
can
I
do?
-
He
wouldn't
listen
to
me.
It
may
be
best
for
us
if
Rua
dies.
And
Bleda
becomes
king?
-
Where
is
Attila?
-
How
long
has
he
been
there?
Why
does
he
tarry?
I
don't
know.
If
there's
one
thing
it's
news
of
Rua's
death.
Attila
must
return.
You
love
him.
A
woman
who
does
not
is
blind.
But
he
would
never
love
a
toadstool.
-
Why
do
you
help
me?
I
must
be
true
to
them,
and
my
visions
tell
me
He
must
return.
Therefore,
let
today's
king
die
When
you
said
Rome
would
seduce
him,
-
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
A
marriage
Married
to
a
barbarian?
I
doubt
it.
But
at
least
there'd
be
Spare
me
your
speech
-
Like
it
or
not,
we
must
make
them.
An
alliance
with
the
Huns
and
buy
us
time
to
make
If
he'll
have
her,
they
will
marry.
Over
my
dead
body.
Well,
if
you
insist.
He
puts
too
much
faith
Even
if
this
marriage
occurred
the
Huns
might
think
it
-
It
must
not
occur.
It
may
require
drastic
measures.
Then
take
them.
And
Aetius
I
understand.
I
never
believed
in
destiny
before,
It
was
destiny
Do
you
believe
in
destiny,
Attila?
-
Perhaps.
So
many
people
"The
will
of
God"
this
Actually,
I
only
know
who
really
takes
destiny
seriously.
Flavius
Aetius.
Strange,
isn't
it?
I
despise
him
but
adore
you.
-
What's
his
destiny?
And
what's
yours?
A
soothsayer
in
my
village
And
when
you
find
it?
I'll
rule
the
world.
How
sad
for
Aetius.
Aetius
can
take
care
of
himself.
If
you'll
excuse
me.
-
What
do
you
think
of
her?
That's
all?
What
else
is
there
to
say
of
a
woman?

You've
never
loved,
then.
Once.
Perhaps.
The
slave
girl,
the
red-haired
one.
A
man
in
your
position
Those
that
you
love...
and
those
that
are
merely...
useful.
And
if
your
destiny
you
could
do
worse
What
if
Rome
is
part
of
the
world
Well,
there
are
many
ways
to
conquer.
You
captured
Honoria
and
she
may
be
the
key
To
conquest,
however
achieved.
Father,
this
message
Rua
is
dead.
-
I
must
leave
at
once.
Bleda
will
be
plotting
against
me.
Get
a
fresh
start
in
the
morning.
Send
a
messenger
but
take
a
different
route
Challenge
him
quickly,
-
A
pretext.
For
example,
you
might
-
The
fact
is,
he
probably
did.
It's
no
matter.
It's
good
politics.
It'll
put
him
on
the
defensive.
Attila...
if
things
go
badly,
you
know
I
will
live
or
die
among
the
Huns.
Then
rest.
Have
you
been
eavesdropping?
No,
learning.
You'll
miss
him,
won't
you?
Yes,
I'll
miss
him.
Rome
produces
This
Bleda,
Of
course.
I'll
say
a
prayer
for
him
Yes.
Say
one
for
Rome
as
well.
Oh,
I
beg
pardon,
master.
I
thought
you
were
leaving.


Take
him!
Take
him!
Your
king
commands
it!
You
are
not
yet
king.
Bring
me
my
crown!
Quickly!
You
see
how
he
wants
to
steal
You
lie.
Rua
should
have
died
as
he
lived.
A
warrior,
not
in
his
sleep.
No
man
can
choose
-
No,
not
if
he's
murdered.
and
I
am
the
elder
son
Therefore,
I
am
the
rightful
king.
To
what
purpose?
To
be
paid
or
some
other
nation?
We
will
live
What
else
should
we
do?
We
should
rule
the
world!
You'd
have
us
attack
Rome?
No.

He
has
been
bought
off.
Besides,
he
has
a
whore
in
Rome
If
we
attack
Rome,
We
will
return
and
our
women
gone.

You've
said
but
you've
not
said
Attack
north...
Pannonia
and
beyond.
-
Attack
our
own
people?!
But
Huns
nonetheless,
and
we've
been
at
peace
And
war
will
come
again,
You
all
know
the
ancient
prophecy.
The
one
who
finds
Have
you
found
this
sword?
No.
Then
your
words
are
empty.
I
will
give
a
different
sign.
I
say
you
murdered
Rua,
and
are
not
fit
to
take
his
place.
And
I
say
you
lie.
Then
we'll
meet
tomorrow
Let
the
strongest
prevail.
And
that
will
be
the
sign.
He
will
tip
his
arrows
with
poison.
If
I
die
of
poison,
the
tribe
This
poison
leaves
no
sign.
How
would
Bleda
get
such
a
poison?
You?
Galen...
What
evil
have
you
worked
for
him?
Did
he
poison
Rua?
Bleda
swore
he'd
kill
me
Besides,
I
knew
it
would
-
I
would
have
come
back
anyway!
-
Your
visions!
This
time
tomorrow
you'll
be
king.
-
Give
me
some
of
your
poison!
There
are
no
more
mushrooms.
Then
you've
not
only
killed
Rua,
No.
If
the
poison
enters
you,
How?
Will
you
be
riding
next
to
me
Attila,
find
the
sword.
If
you
have
the
sword,
Nobody
has
found
it
How
am
I
supposed
to
find
it
I'm
through
with
you,
woman.
Never
speak
to
me
again.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Come
on!

Powers
of
earth
and
sky,
be
true
Give
Galen's
strength
to
Attila



Hyah!

Hah!
Ha.
Ha.



Give
Galen's
strength
to
Attila
-
Hyah!
Hyah!

Attila!
Attila!
Attila!
