Forget

I'm
a
little
nervous,
I
didn't

that.
We're

Poytche,
said
he
had
to
do
right
by
me
with
surgery.
She
called
me
a
soldier,

as
any
man
here.
And
I
liked
that,
I

I
still
do.

Mum

at

that
speech,

wasn't
the
one
you
were
practicing.
I
wouldna
let
you
out

if
it

I
didn't

I
wished
on

for
something
I
never
knew.
Wished
on

moon
for
more
than
I
ever
knew.
that
would
not
dance
away.
I
begged
on
the
stars
to
throw
me

I
looked
for

came

GLADYS:
Dear
Lewis,
the
day
we
met
I
First
in
attending
the
dance
and
Lewis
I
am
engaged
to
another
man.
I
was
wrong
to
have
pretended
otherwise
and
I
was
thoughtless
in
accepting
your
proposal.
Although
he
has
no
reason
to
believe
My
heart
belongs
to
him
....
What
he
wanted
was
so
simple,
and
he
made
me
feel
like
only
I
could
give
it
to
him.
Is
there
some
way
?
You
were
intimate
with
this
man.
It
was
just
some
kissing
and
petting,
you
had
a
full
fledged
sexual
affair.
It's
not
the
same
thing.
KATE:
Why
not
?
Because
I
didn't
care
about
her,
Except
you
showed
her
more

What
are
you
afraid
of
James
?
That
this
is
me,
that
this
is
all
there
is.
That's
all
I've
ever
wanted.
If

I've
done
this
all
wrong
I'm
so
sorry,
I'm
so
sorry.
Make
it
up
to
me.
You
sure
?
Yes.
I
love
you.
I
love
you
too.

James.
Was
it
worth
the
wait
?
Only
if
we
make
up
for
lost
time.
Your
letter
to
that
airman,
Lewis.
You
can't
send
it.
I
have
to
tell
him
the
truth,
Right
now
he
thinks
that
he's
You
can
break
his
heart
when
the
war
is
over.
I'm

he'll
have

me
by

think
that's
possible.

to

about

Lorna.
No

that's
Well,
lucky
we
have
our
families.
Yeah,
I
saw
your
husband
yesterday.
Yes
you
did.
Not
exactly
what
I
was
expecting.
Bob's
a
good
man.
Why,
because
he
wheeled
out
for
one
speech.
How
dare
you
!!
You're
not
happy
with
him
Lorna.
I
know
what
it

him

late,

short.
Not
even
a

You
think
this
is
funny
?
Of
course
if
this
comes
from
one
of
those
Three

cans
that
may
be
spoiled,
Whataya
you
think
James,
about
Ten
minutes
from

to
the
hospital
?
Sounds
about
right.
Get
this
outa
my
face!
All
the
more
for
me.
Hmmm
Ptomaine
poison.
Gladys

in

as
you
do.
Well,
I've
lost
