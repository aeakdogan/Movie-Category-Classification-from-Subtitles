MAN:
Do
we
belong
there?
It
doesn't
matter
...
because
we
are
there.
We
can't
even
console
ourselves
Because
they're
not.

It
is
a
fallacy
that
prolonged
war
SOLDIER:
It
most
likely
They
get
used
to
the
deprivation,
While
here
at
home...
The
explosion
occurred
in
one
of
...with
every
death
reported...
...we
have
to
deal
with
a
public-opinion
...from
supportive
to
negative
People
just
get
sick
and
tired
They
just
wanna
be
told
that
it's
over.
REPORTER
:
Police
and
emergency
...
are
still
combing
through
what
is
left
They
say
this
was
not
the
target.
Had
the
bombs
being
constructed
here
...
the
devastation
could...
HOFFMAN:
...we
have
markedly
increased
...we're
not
seeing
any
progress.
What
we're
dealing
with
here...
...is
potentially
a
global
conflagration...
...that
requires
constant
diligence
Now,
you
see...
...because
our
enemy...
...has
realized
that
they
are
fighting
guys
Now,
ahem,
it
is
brilliant
If
you
live
like
it's
the
past,
...then
guys
from
the
future
If
you
throw
away
your
cell
phone,
...
pass
all
your
instructions
face-to-face,
...
turn
your
back
on
technology
No
flags.
No
uniforms.
You
got
your
basic
grunts
They're
looking
going,
In
a
situation
like
this,
...
and
your
enemies
dress
What
I
need
you
to
fully
understand
is
that
Not
at
all.
They
want
the
universal
caliphate
...
and
they
want
every
infidel
converted
So,
what's
changed...
...is
that
our
...has
cottoned
on
...we're
an
easy
target.
We
are
an
easy
target...
...
and
our
world
as
we
know
it
...to
put
to
an
end
than
you
might
think.
We
take
our
foot
off
the
throat
...and
our
world
changes
completely.

BASSAM
:
FERRIS:

You're
early.
Big
boss
man,
what's
happening?

What's
the
story?
Rules
of
the
day.
If
the
car
gets
immobilized,
Nobody
gets
traded.
Everybody
dies.
So
same
as
every
day?
-
You
got
it.
Want
some
breakfast?
Thanks.

All
right.
Tell
me
something
real.
BASSAM:
All
right,
let's
hear
it.
All
right,
a
guy
named
Nizar.
He's
from
Aquiz
up
near
Tikrit,
right?
So
he
gets
all
fucked
in
his
head
He
starts
working
with
the
Baathists,
But
he
is
scared
shitless
now,
man.
He's
supposed
...but
he
doesn't
wanna
fucking
die.
So
he's
coming
to
us.
-
He's
coming
to
us?

FERRIS:

SOLDIER:
Move
it,
let's
go.
Come
on,
come
on.
BASSAM:
Oh,
my
God.
Just
get
the...

Come
on,
come
on.

So,
what
are

:
Yeah,
Nizar.

NIZAR:
Huh?
NIZAR:
WOMAN:
-
He
says
he
wants
one
of
us
to
come
in.
Inside
the
car.
You
have
to
come
to
us,
Nizar.
-
I'm
coming
to
you.
Hey,
hey.
Listen
to
me.
I
am
not
getting
my
head
cut
off
If
something
happens,
shoot
me.
-
Will
you
shoot
me?
-
I'm
not
kidding.
BASSAM:
WOMAN:
Visual
confirmed.
Long

Shit.
-
I
can't
talk
right
now,
Larry.
FERRIS:
Give
her
the
house.
-
We're
getting
this,
sir.
She
can
ask
for
whatever
she
wants,
What
the
hell
are
you
calling
for?
Hang
up
the
phone.
Are
you
on
the
line?
I
can
see
you
now,
all
right?
Get
the
fuck
out
of
here
right
now.
Roger
that.
Off
target.
WOMAN:
FERRIS
:
Yes.
FERRIS:
FERRIS:
No.
So,
Nizar...
...why'd
you
come
to
me,
huh?
I
know
too
many
things.
They
prepared
me
to
go
outside
Iraq.
What
do
you
mean
by
"outside
Iraq"?
They
said
they
need
me
...for
martyrdom.
When
a
man
knows
too
much,
Who
do
you
mean
by
"they,"
Nizar?
Hm?

I
don't
want
to
die.
I
want
to
go
to
America.
I
have
a
Ph.D.,
you
know?
And
they
want
me...
-
Ph.D.
in
what,
chemistry?
What
do
you
know
Linguistic.
I
speak
five
languages.
Nobody
should
say
"martyr"
to
me.
-
You
are
a
rare
and
a
delicate
flower.
-
Yes.
So
you
don't
wanna
kill
the
Jews
What
do
you
know
about
our
pain?
Cut
the
bullshit,
all
right?
Give
me
some
information.

You
know,
But
with
you,
You
have
a
computer?
[AL-SALEEM
SPEAKING
IN
ARABIC


-
Yup.
I
got
an
Iraqi
walk-in,
up
near
Samarra.
He's
got
a
communiqu
video
here
that
I'm
watching
it
right
now,
sir.
-
Can
you
see
his
face?
I
am
looking
at
the
white
whale.
-
It
is
Al-Saleem.
Well,
it's
gotta
be
current.
He
mentions
the
Sheffield
bus
bombings
He's
telling
the
brothers
to
prepare
for
...which
is
the
bombing
these
people
Let
me
translate
this
part

"We
will
avenge
the
America
wars
We
will
come
at
them
everywhere.
We
will
strike
at
random,
across
Europe,
We
have
bled.
Now
they
will
bleed.
And
bleed.
Until
they
are
bled
out."
WOMAN:
It's
6:00
in
the
morning.
Saving
civilization,
honey.
FERRIS:
The
communiqus
are
not
transmitted,
My
man
says
that
real
orders
Is
there
any
indication
of
where
he
is?
No,
sir.
But
he
did
mention
there's
a
safe
house
...
where
Al-Saleem
may
have
been.
BOY:
HOFFMAN:
They're
killing
anyone
who
knows
anything.
We
need
to
debrief
him
very
carefully.
-
All
right,
so
do
it.
No.
Ahem.
They're
onto
him.
-
On
the
toilet,
not
the
floor.
So
he
wants
to
come
to
America
...instead
of
going
to
paradise
He
should've
thought
of
that
before.
I'm
telling
you.
Yep.
And
if
they
do,
that's
all
right...
...because
we
can
be
there
Now,
get
back
to
bed.
Good
night.
-
Am
I
missing
the
point?
Well,
you
lied,
buddy.
So
just
cut
him
loose...
...
and
put
him
back
on
the
street.
All
right.
Okay,
so
everything's
fine.
We
just
have
to
ask
you
a
few
more
No,
no
more
questions.
Maybe
we
could
help.
We
have
Trust
me.
Okay?
It's
okay.
Sit
down.

You're
a
liar.
You're
a

You

Get

Back

-
You
want
to
see
who
kills
me,
huh?
Now
you've
seen
our
faces.
Computer.
Guantanamo?
If
you
don't
do
exactly
what
I
say...
...I
will
execute
you
right
here.
Listen,
we
are
your
friends,
okay?
We're
here
to
watch
you.
You
can't
even
protect
yourselves.

riding
up

He's
coming
down

gonna
hang
back.

Keep
an

on

He's
walking
right
up.

Listen,

There
is
a
black

heading
this

They're
staring
right
at
him.
FERRIS:
Tell
me
what
it
does.
Looks
like
it's
parking
right
up
ahead.

There's
like
four
or
five

What

No

Can

now
he
has
sent

is

he
is
no

up


You
are
God's

to
your

You
have
done
none
of

for
her.
A

is
worth

you
will

we

learn
what
he
naturally
learns...
