I

I'm
going
to
faint.

Huh?
Oh,
wait...
Please!
Hey!

-
Hey!

Don't
you
know
me?
-
Of
course.
Yes,
I...
I
feel
better
now.
-
Ah.
What's
below?
-
Looks
like
the
sun.
-
Seems
to
be
shining
upwards.
-
How's
the
gas?
No,
no,
no!
Oh.
Almost
empty.
We
must
be
nearly
there.
Time?
About,
approximately,
one
minute
to
12:00.

Strange.
Look
at
that.
Huh!
Huh.
Seem

Ohh.
Ohh.

I
can...
We'll

What

-
Here,
take

There's
something
wrong.
Oh,
I
can't
reach
it.
Oh,
water!
Faint!
Ah!
Oh,
it's
all
gone!
What's
the
matter?
-
This
belt
is
too
tight.
I'm
trying
to.
-

-
I
know
it.
-
Impossible.
Oh.
There
it
goes.
We're
out
of
gas.
Well,
I
suppose
this
is
the
end.

Cigarette?
Then
I
shan't
need
this
anymore.
What
month
is
it?
April.
Spring
in
Tomainia.
Hilda
will
be
in
the
garden
now
How
she
loves
daffodils.
She
would
never
cut
them
It
was
like
taking
a
life
Sweet,
gentle
Hilda.
A
beautiful
soul.
And
she
loved
animals.
And
little
children
too.

We've
landed!
Dispatches!
Comrade,
where
are
you?
Comrade!
Comrade,
the
dispatches!
-
Are
you
hurt?
-
What's
that?
If
I
don't
deliver
these
dispatches

Well,
the
war's
over.

We

Good
morning,
Mr.

What's
good
about
it?
Well,
conditions
could
be
worse.
If
you
think
they
could
be
worse,
Aha.
You
heard
Hynkel's

you're

He's
holding

at

Hannah,

down...
and

I'll
be
down.
I
don't

does
this
Commander
Schultz
He
wants
us
to
blow
up
the
palace.
What?
We
Jewish
people
shouldn't
I
know
it,
but
Commander
Schultz
is
such
I
knew
he
was
up
to
some
mischief.
Sure,
he
is!
I
came
in
the
kitchen
this
evening...
and
found
him
putting
a
coin
Putting
a
coin
in
one
of
the
puddings?
But
don't
worry.
I've
fixed
everything.

Tonight

receive
a

the

to
be
chosen
this

Much
as
I
should

cannot.
Why?
Don't
you
understand?
It
must
be
done
by
somebody
like
us.
I
can't
see
it
like
that.
Gentlemen,
if
this
is
a
question
of
Commander
Schultz,
And
let
me
say
on
behalf
that
we
consider
it
a
great
privilege
Very

Until
then,
hail
Hynk...
Oh,

am
I
saying?
Gentlemen,
we
have
pledged
our
honor.
Proceed.








Gentlemen,
the
coin
is
here.

What's
the
meaning
of
all
this?
Somebody
made
a
fool
of
us.
-
You're
quite
right.
I
did.
I
put
a
coin
in
every
pudding.
Mr.
Jaeckel!
Blowing
up

and

to
kill
people.
Hannah's
right.

is

this?

I'm
sorry
for

Yes,

What

a
shave
together?
-
Good!

Ah,
this
is
the
barbershop.
Ah,
now

is-a
sweet...

Do
you
like
it?
It
was
the
emperor's
library.
-
Too
old
fashioned.
I
want
something
modern.
You
see,
when
I
get
shaved,
I'm
very
nervous.
So
I'm

Yes.
That

You
don't

me.
Oh,
yes.

Of

Now,
about

Ah,

No

Shh,

as
I'm

We

In

Hold-a

Now,
look.
You

this-a
treaty
a-first...
then
I
remove-a
the
troops
after.
-
Well,
what
are
we
arguing
about?
You
don't
expect
me
to

You
don't
expect
me
to

Why
not?
-
Why
shouldn't
you?
Osterlich
is
a
free
country.
Your
soldiers
are
there,
And
they'll
stay
there

You'll
take
them
off,
or
I'll
blow
them
off!

Gentlemen,
this
won't
get
us
anywhere.
Your
Excellency,

quote


Strawberries.
Where's

Can't
we
sit
down
and
discuss
this...
Nobody

to
me
in

own-a
joint
Can't
we
sit
down
and
discuss
this
thing
I
am
not-a

I
want

to

the
treaty.
Can't

understand?
signing
such
a
treaty
when
your

Not

I'm-a

I

an
appointment.
I'm
from
the
international
press.
Very
successfully.
How
did
you
get
in?

How
did
this

get
in
here?
You
know
the
regulations
of
the
palace
in
Tell
him
not
to
allow
anyone
else
to
enter

You
understand?

Of
course,
there
are
minor
details
Excuse
me.
We're
very
busy.

-
Oh!
The
press
are
outside.
The
whole
world
-
So
what?
-
Not
until
he-a
signs!
Your
Excellency,
-
Do
you
mind?
-
What
is
it?
Why
should
he
have
the
advantage?
What
does
it
matter,
The
moment
you
sign,
We
can
move
in
without
losing
a
man.
I'll
sign.

What?
Ah,
my
little
Hynkie!
My-a
dictator
brother!
Two
prisoners
escaped
in
officers'
uniforms!
Sound
the
alarm!

The
planes
are
searching
for
us.
Let's
make
for
the
woods.
No.
We
must
keep
in
the
open.
The
invasion

Osterlich.
Now...
or
never.

Ducks!
Did
you
hear
that?
Came
from
over
there.
Come
on.


Da
Blitzen!

Cheese
and
crackers!

A
yodeler,
huh?
-
What?

Where's
your
partner?
Where's
Schultz?
-
He'll
talk
when
he
gets
into
camp!
There
it
is...

If
we
can
pass
through
there,
-
Couldn't
we
go
through
the
woods?
The
woods
are
swarming
with
soldiers.
We
must
face
the
music.
We
must
bluff
our
way
through.
Here
they
come.
Can
you
see
what
they're
doing?
-
They're
looking
this
way.
They're
beginning
to
follow
us.
Certainly
not.
-
Just
a
little
bit?
We
could
walk
a
little
faster.
Hmm?
Make
up
your
mind.
-

Perhaps
we'd
better
slow
down.

There's
no
hurry.

What
is
it?
What?
Bugler!
Sound
assembly!

Look

The

He
