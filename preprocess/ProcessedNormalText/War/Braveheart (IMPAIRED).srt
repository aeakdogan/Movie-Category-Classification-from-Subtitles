How
could
you
know

I'm
sorry.
Are
you
in
the
habit
of

No.
Well,

You're
going
to
if
you
like.
In
what
language?
You're
showing
off
now.
That's
right.
No.
Why
should
I
be?

Do

is
a
brigand,

how
would
you
deal

Have
the

and
punish
him
Leave

condemning
it
from
our

a
while.
This
Wallace...
he
doesn't
even
but
he
fights
and
he
inspires.
And
you
wish
to
charge
off

as
rich
as
they
are

noble.
And
understand
this--
Edward
Longshanks

sit
and
none
of

will
remain
Give
ear
to

he
did.
We
can

are
they
I
can't
hear,
The
nobles

do
then
we
go
home.
If
not,
We
have
no
chance.


So
many.
I
didn't
come
here
so
they
could
own
Then
I'll
have
to
Nor
me.
All
right,
lads!
Let's
go
home!

Stop,

and
if
he
were
here,
with
fireballs
and
bolts
of
lightning

I
am
William

and
I
see

come
to
fight

you
are.
What
will
you
do
Will

you
may
die.
Run,
and
you'll
live...
at

awhile.

right.


Agreed.
Fine
speech.
Now
what
do
we
do?
