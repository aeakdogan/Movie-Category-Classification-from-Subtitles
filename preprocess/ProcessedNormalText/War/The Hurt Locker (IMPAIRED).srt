Sorry.
Just
trying

a
war.
People
die
all
the

Why
not
me?
You
got
to
change
the

things.
Okay.
Stop
obsessing.
You
want

Yeah.
Here's

Keep
the
change.
Want

Get

Thank

Take

easy.
I
need
to
talk
to
you
about
something
What's

Yesterday.
Wasn't
cool.
Yeah,
I
know.
You'll
get
it,
though.

So,

a
ranger,
huh?
I
was

All

See
any
wires?
Any
smoke?

All
right,
so
how
do
you
know
it's
a
bomb?
The
suspension
is
sagging.
There's
definitely
something
heavy
Right.
So,
why
don't
you
walk
over
there
and
tell
me
what
you
see?
You
want
me
to
go
close
to
it?
Yeah.
No.
I
don't.
No,
I'm
kidding.

"Hey,

got
a
survivable
wound,
sir.

Oh,
God.
-
What's
he
doing?
What
are
you
doing?
There's
enough
bang
in
there
If
I'm
going
to
die,
I
wanna
die
comfortable.
-
What's
going
on
down
there,
Eldridge?
Cover
me,
please.
Kit

Got
a

All

I'm
gonna
look
Well,

the
back
seat.
I
don't
think.
All
right.
It's
not
in
the
back
seat.
Got
a
young
man
on
the
roof,
Roger

It's
not
in
the
front
seat.
It's
not
in
the
door.
Not
on
the

Not
in
the

box.
If
you
haven't
found
it
yet,
Yeah.
No
wire
leads
under
the
car.
-
Hey,
Sanborn.
You
got
eyes
on
some
guy
-
No.
Where?
He's
pointing
the
fucking
thing
right
at
me.
Shit.
Negative.
I
don't
see
him.
Hey,
Sanborn.
He's
right
at
my

o'clock.
Roger

I

him.
ELDRIDGE:
Getting
ready

Little
shady.

Keep
an
eye
on
him.
Be
smart.
Make
a
good
decision,
over.

Got
more

leads
fucking
nowhere.
Fuck!
-
SANBORN:
Hey,
James,
how

doing?
You
know,
we've
been
here
a
while.
-
We
need
to
get
out
of
here
soon.
We
got
a
lot
of
eyes
on
us,
James.
Roger

I'm
going
to
figure
this
out.
SANBORN:
James,

SANBORN:
What
the
hell
is
he
doing?
Looks
like
he's
checking
the
oil.
They're
communicating
-
This
is
real
bad,
man.
-
I
can't
see
James
from
here.
We

Bastard.


We're

That's
gotta
be
a
record.
What's
the
best
way
to
go
about
The
way
you
don't
die,
sir.
That's
a
good
one.
Hey,

I
thought
we

divorced.
and
she
says
we're
still
together,
What
does
that
make
her?
I
don't
know.
Dumb
for
still
being
with
your

Hey.
She
ain't

She's
just
loyal.
That's
all.

He's

in
a
little
trouble.
Look,

three
infantry
platoons
whose
job
it
is

Tankers

Hey.
Doc
says
you're
going
to
be
okay.
My
fucking
femur
is
shattered
He
said
I'll
be
walking
in
six
months,
-
Six
months
ain't
bad,
huh?

Take
it
easy,
buddy.
You
see
that?
You
fucking
see
that?
That's
what
happens
when
you

Sorry.
Sorry,
Owen.
Fuck

Will.
Really.
Fuck

Thanks
for
saving
my
life,
looking
for
trouble
to
Hey,
take
care
of
yourself,
Owen.
Come
home
safe,
man.
-
See
you
on
the
other
side,
man.
Let's
get
out
of
this
fucking
desert!
SOLDIER:
Don't
move.
If
you
keep
walking,
we
will
shoot
you.
Move
him
back.
:
"If
you
move,
they'll
shoot
you."
Keep
that
translator
back.
-
But
the
bomb
was
forced
on
him.
Don't
move!
Stay
still!
:
"Don't
move"
If
you
keep
walking,
we
will
shoot
you.
If
you
keep
walking,
we
will
shoot.
Get
that
translator
back,
now.
:
"Stay
still"
-
TRANSLATOR:
He's
not
a
bad
man.
Give
him
room.
Give
him
room.
:
"Please,
save
me
from
that
bomb"
Hey,
what
do
you
got?
He
came
walking
up
to
our
checkpoint,
But
he's
sorry.
He
doesn't
want
it
to
go
off.
Then
he
starts
begging
us
-
Right.
SANBORN:
He's
not
a
bad
man?
This
is
a
joke.
He's
trying
to
pull
us
closer.
Yeah,
I
got
it.
I
got
it.
All
right.
and
see
what's
inside.
:
"Open
your
shirt,
so
that
he
can
see
what's
underneath"
Slowly.
Slowly.
Slowly!
:
"Ok.
no
problem...but
please
save
me
quickly".."I
swear
it
will
explode"
Jesus.
All
right,
Sergeant,
I
need
-
Get
them
back.
You
tell
him
to
get
on
his
knees
:
"Go
on
your
knees
and
raise
your
hands
up"
Slowly!
Get
down!
:
"Quickly,
please"
Okay.
I
need
your
radio.
Can't
we
just
shoot
him?
-
TRANSLATOR:
No,
no,
no.
He's
a
family
man.
He's
not
a
bad
man.
-
Yeah,
all
right.
Look.
You
get
back.
-
Like
everybody
else.
You
don't
want
to
die,
get
back!
I
got
it.
:
"I
don't
want
to
die..Just
save
me"
-
Listen.
I
know
we've
had
our
differences.
Eldridge...
Look,
it
happened,
all
right?
James,
this
is
suicide,
man.
That's
why
they
call
it
:
"Guys,
the
bomb
has
been
there
for
an
hour...it
will
explode"
Let's
do
this.
TRANSLATOR:
He
says
please
hurry.
-
We're
good.
Yeah.
-
Go
get
them.
-
See
you.
Yeah.
:
"I
have
a
family
and
kids".."Please
save
me"!
JAMES:
Get
your
hands
up.
:
"I
have
a
family
and
kids".."I
don't
want
to
die
this
way"!
TRANSLATOR:
He
says
he
has
a
family.
:
"I
don't
want
to
die
this
way"!
TRANSLATOR:
Please
help.
:
"I
have
a
family
and
kids"
Now,
listen.
-
TRANSLATOR:
Please.
It'd
be
a
lot
easier
for
me
to
disarm
this
:
"I
have
a
family".."I
don't
want
to
die
this
way"..."Please
take
this
off
me"
All
right.
What's
he
saying?
He
says,
"I
don't
wish
to
die.
I
have
a
family.
"Please
take
this
off
me."
All
right.
or
I'll
be
very
happy
to
shoot
him.
:
"Friends..it's
going
to
explode"..."Look,
it's
going
to
explode"
:
"Put
your
hands
on
your
head"
:
"Put
your
hands
up"!
Look,
that's
not
what
I
said.
or
I
will
shoot
him.
:
"Put
your
hands
behind
your
head"
Listen.
:
"Haste...put
your
hands
on
top
of
your
head...he
is
going
to
shoot
you"!
Listen,
listen.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes?
You
understand?
:
"Yes..yes"
Okay.
What
do
you
got
here?
TRANSLATOR:
He
has
four
children.
Shit.
:
"Save
me...hurry
up,
please"
All
right,
Sanborn,
we
got
a
timer,
I'm
going
to
need
a
little
help
on
this.
Roger
that.
Tell
me
what
you
need.
Bolt
cutters.
But
you
gotta
get
down
here
-
or
we're
all
fucked.
:
"Hurry
up,
please...save
me..I
have
a
family"
TRANSLATOR:
He
says,
:
"Hurry
up,
please...save
me..I
have
a
family"
I
know.
I
know.
Just...
It's
okay,
you're
all
right.
You're
all
right.

"I
swear
that
God
is
one,
and
that
Prophet
Muhammed
is
the
Messenger
of
God"
TRANSLATOR:
Says,
"Please
don't
leave
me."
:
"O,
God...O,
God"
-
You
weren't
fucking
kidding.
What's
this
made
out
of?

Shit.
SANBORN:
Oh,
man.

Shit.
-
What's
our
time?
-
Shit.
Well,
we
don't
have
one
of
those
-
He's
dead,
man.
Just
let
me
think.
Let's
handle
this.
It's
okay.
We
got
this.
We
got
this.
I'm
gonna
look
at
the
back.
It's
just...
We
don't
got
enough
time,
I
just
gotta...
I
gotta
get
these
bolts
off.
No.
We
got
a
minute
and
a
half,
man.
-
I'll
handle
this.
Just
go.
Look,
I'm
right
behind
you.
Just
go.
Fuck
him!
Come
on.
Let's
go.
-
Sanborn,
I
got
the
suit.
Just
go.
Sanborn,
you
have
45
seconds.
-
He's
a
fucking
dead
man,
Will!
-
Everybody
get
back!

We
got
one.
Go!
Get
back!
Get
back!
Shit,
I
can't!
There's
too
many
locks.
I
can't
get
it
off.
I'm
sorry.
Okay?
You
hear
me?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry!
Get
down
now!
I
can't
help
him.
Everybody
stay
down!
Stay
down!
:
"I
swear
that
God
is
one..."
James!
Everybody
up
and
out.
James!

You
all
right?
No,
man.
I
fucking
hate
this
place.
Here,
man.
Have
a
hit.
I'm
not
ready
to
die,
James.
Well,
you're
not
going
to
die
out
here,
bro.
Another
two
inches.
Shrapnel
zings
by,
slices
my
throat.
I
bleed
out
like
a
pig
in
the
sand.
Nobody
will
give
a
shit.
I
mean,
my
parents
will
care,
I
don't
even
have
a
son.
Well,
you're
going
to
have
-
No,
man.
I'm
done.
I
want
a
son.
I
want
a
little
boy,
Will.
I
mean,
how
do
you
do
it,
you
know?
Take
the
risk.
I
don't
know.
I
just...
Every
time
we
go
out,
it's
life
or
death.
You
recognize
that,
don't
you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I
do.
But
I
don't
know
why,
you
know.

I
don't
know,
J.T.
Do
you
know
why
I
am
the
way
I
am?
No,
I
don't.
Pizza.
Pizza.

-
Wow.
You
did
some
shopping.
I
got
some
soda.
We
done?
You
want
to
go
get
us
some
cereal
Okay.
Cereal.
Where...
Some
guy
drove
his
truck
starts
passing
out
free
candies.
All
the
kids
come
running
up,
He
detonates.
They're
saying
59
are
dead.
You
know
they
need
more
bomb
techs.
You
want
to
chop
those
up
for
me?
Boing!
Boing!




Yeah.
You
love
playing
with
that.
You
love
playing
You
love
your
mommy,
your
daddy,
You
love
everything,
don't
you?
Yeah.

But
you
know
what,
buddy?
some
of
the
things
that
you
love
might
Like
your
jack-in-the-box.
Maybe
you
realize
As
you
get
older,
And
by
the
time
you
get
to
my
age,
With
me,
I
think
it's
one.
