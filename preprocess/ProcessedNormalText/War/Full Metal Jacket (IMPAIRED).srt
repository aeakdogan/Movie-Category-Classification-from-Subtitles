You

Do

Sir,
yes,

I
can't
hear
you.

Sir,
yes,
sir!
If
you
ladies
leave
my
island,
...you
will
be
a
weapon,
But
until
that
day,
you
are
pukes!
The
lowest
form
of
life
on
Earth.
You
are
not
even
human
fucking
beings!
You
are
only
unorganized,
Because
I
am
hard,
you
won't
like
me.
The
more
you
hate
me,
I
am
hard,
but
I
am
fair!
There
is
no
racial
bigotry
here!
I
do
not
look
down
on
niggers,
Here,
you
are
all
equally
worthless!
My
orders
are
to
weed
out
non-hackers...
...who
do
not
pack
the

Do
you
maggots
understand
that?
Sir,
yes,

Bullshit!
I
can't
hear
you!

Sir,
yes,

-What's
your

HARTMAN:
Who
said

Who

Who's
the

...who
just
signed
his

Nobody,

You've

face?

That's
a

Let

see
yours!

You
didn't
convince
me!

-You
don't

Work
on

What's
your
excuse?
Sir,

I'm
asking
the

Sir,
yes,

Thank

Sir,

Are

Nervous?

You

-You

I

you
would
fuck
...and
not
have
the
courtesy
I'll
be
watching

-Your
parents
have
children
that
lived?
Bet
they
regret
that!
You're
so
ugly
-What's
your

-Lawrence,

That

sounds
like

-You

-Then
wipe

Any

I'm
trying,

I'll
give
you
three
