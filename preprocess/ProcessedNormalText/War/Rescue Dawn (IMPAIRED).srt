I

I
just
thought
we'd
be
assisting
against

Whole
thing
You
picked
the
wrong
time
-
to
enlist,
Dengler.
No,
but
I
just
wanted
to
fly
so
badly,
and
everybody,
they
were
telling
me
and
the
go-go
girls,
everything,
and...
And
what
did
I
get?
-
One
night
in
Saigon.
That's
me.
Gentlemen,
next
please.
Okay.
Hey,
are
there
any

Okay.

You

it,
sir.
-
Absolutely,
sir.
Now,
look
here.
Look
at
this.

Why
do
I
have
my
boot
on
your
table?
Okay,
this
is
why.
Look
at
this.
Can
you
create
a
flap
for
me
so
I
could

You

Where

you?
Come

God,
how
can
it

Hey.
Hey.
I
need...
I
need
to
go

Yeah.
I
need
to
take
a
shit.
Hey.
Hey.
I
need
to
take
a
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Hey.
Hey.
Does
nobody
listen
to
me?
Why
doesn't
anybody
listen
around
here?
Why
don't
you
listen
to
me?
I
said
I
needed
the
bathroom
Why
doesn't
anybody
listen
around
here?
I've
shit
my
pants.


They
can't
hear
us.
It's
not
my
fault.
I
didn't
signal
them.

Don't
ever,
ever
do
that
again!
You
better
just
shoot
me
right
away!



This
is
unusual.
You
American
pilots
normally
attack
us

No
English.
German.
Why
don't
you
admit
Yes.
I
am
an
American
citizen,
and
I
love
my
country.
But
why
are
you
in
this
war
against
us?
I
never
wanted
to
go
to
war.
I
saw
enough
as
a
child.
Then
you
should
sign

What
isn't

-
Procet.
Okay.

That
was
actually
Procet...
Got
that?
-
But
you
need
to
call
him
Procet.
That's
what
we
call
him.
He's
also
Air

-
Also
got
shot
down

the
rest
of
us.
Two...
No,
two
and
a
half
year
ago
now.
-
Two
and
a
half
years
ago?
I
had
no

longer

I
was
shot
down
-
Okay.
we'll
be
here
a
lot
longer
Well,
you
see...
How
many
more
times
you
think
like
I
been
saying
and
saying
and
saying
that
we
will
never
go
to
war
-
DIETER:
No,
they
just...
Because
any
day
now...
Listen.
-
Yeah,
Christmas
come
every
day.
They
will
release
us,
man.

They
will
let
us
go
any
day
now.
-
No,
you
see...
-
Gene.
It's...
The
trick
to
it
is
it's
actually
Eugene.
-
Okay,
Eugene.
-
Eugene,
Oregon.
-
How
do
you
like
that?
See
how
that
works
out?
Name,
name...
Jesus
Christ,
not
this
Oregon
shit,
again.
I've
heard
this
over
2,000
goddamn
times.
-
Eugene
from
Eugene.
-
You
know
what?
You
know
what?
Listen.
What
you
really
need
to
know
is
Take
a
good
look
at
him.
He,
he...
Listen
now,
he
shits
in
his
pants
Trust
me.
And
you
know
the
only
thing
that
he
You
know
what
that
is?
-
This
man
right
here.
-
Eugene
from
Eugene.
Okay.

GENE:
Dieter.
Take
a
careful
look
to
your
right.
We
call
him
Little
Hitler
He
is
the
worst.
This
one
we
call
Jumbo.
DIETER:
Oh,
wow.
That's
the
first
smile
I've
seen
Yeah.
He's,
in
fact,
This
is
Nook
the
Rook
right
here.
-
What
is
his
problem?
His
problem
is
he's
Crazy
Horse.
And
he
is
a
bastard.
Keep
going.
-
That's
Walkie
Talkie.
We
call
him
that
'cause
he
does
not
speak.
Hey,
do
yourself
a
favor,
Kraut.
Keep
your
head
down
That's
your
best
chance
of
surviving.
So
there
is
a
war.
There
is
a
war.
All
right.
So
tell
me
about
There's
got
to
be
peace
talks,
man.
Shut
up,
Gene.
When
are
you
gonna
get
that
Secret
talks,
man.
Forget
it.
We're
not
getting
out.
No,
no,
no,
there
was
a
honcho
he
said
I
would
not
be
here
too
long.
They
tell
that
to
everyone
No,
I
did
not
sign.
No.
Anyway,
nice
having
met
you.
What
do
you
mean,
met?
Well,
my
friends,
but
I'm
gonna
scram
this
very
night.
This
hut,
it
ain't
no
prison.
Scram.
I
like
that.
I
like
that.
Listen,
listen,
my
friend,
If
you
try
to
escape,
Look,
I
don't
give
a
shit
about
our
release
But
without
water,
you
won't
survive
And
without
water,
The
jungle
is
the
prison.
Don't
you
get
it?
Hey,
when
does
the
rainy
season
start?
Five
months,
maybe
six.
I
can't
wait
that
long.
Hey,
listen,
let's
say
you
do
survive
whatever
you
find,
snakes
and
animals
you
won't
make
it
out
of
camp.
There's
six
guards
posted
during
the
day.
Yeah.
That
is
during
the
day.
I'm
going
at
night.
Why,
what
happens
at
night?
No.
No.
No.
I'm
shitting
my
intestines
out.
Again.
I'm
sorry,
I
can't
help
it.
You
just
shit
right
on
my
hand
again,
man.
-
Sorry.
Leave
the
guy
alone,
okay?
There
ain't
no
alone,
brother.
Does
anybody
have
a
nail?
What
are
you
gonna
do
with
a
nail?
You're
gonna
stab
all
the
lousy
guards
What
kind
of
plane
you
fly
off
of?
-
Procet
has
got
a
shard
of
glass,
man.
I
have
porcupine
needle.
No.
I've
got
a
hammer
and
a
socket
wrench
There's
no
nails.
This
whole
prison's
made
Damn
it.
I
know
where
there's
a
nail.
Okay.
I'm
gonna
make
my
move.
So
all
of
you
scatter
in
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
What
makes
you
think
you're
not
crazy
Eugene's
right.
Oh,
for
God's
sake,
that's
what
I
want.
Please.
You
trust
me?
Please.
Duane,
head
to
the
outhouse.
Y.C.,
go
to
the
top
right.
Okay?
Gene,
please
come
on.
No,
no,
no.
Gene,
Phisit,
Procet,
Move
as
fast
as
you
can.
Get
their
attention,
that's
what
I
need.
Hey,
Jumbo,
Jumbo.
Hey,
no,
no,
no.
Can
I
borrow
some
of
the
toothpaste?
I
felt
so
like
having
a
good
smile,
Like
you
have.
You
got
a
good
smile,
too.
Okay.
Y.C.,
when
I
hit
it,
you
make
a
noise.
Cough
or
something.


I
love
it.
I
love
it.
I
love
it.
I
love
it.
I
love
it.

Give
me
some
slack.
Let's
see.
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God,
that
was
an
easy
one.
You
see,
I
apprenticed
as
a
tool
There
was
no
aviation
at
the
time
that
would
help
me
repair
planes.
And,
boy,
are
those
years
coming
in
handy
There's
only
one
brand
that
is
Smith
and
Wesson.

I
think
with
practice,
I
can
open
these
up
But
listen,
everybody
keep
one
cuff
so
that
if
the
guards
come
checking,
No,
they
don't
check
us
at
night.
They
think
it's
impossible.
Show
me
how
you
did
that.
It's
so
simple.
Okay.
All
you
do,
insert
the
nail.
There's
a
cuff
and
a
spring.
You
push
down
on
the
spring,
You
see?
This
is
what
happens
inside.
-
And
the
cuffs
release.
Hands
free.
DIETER:
Get
away.
Get
away.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Let
him.
Let
him
do
it.
It's
the
best
way
Okay.
Hey,
that
cuff
thing,
that's
good,
real
good.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey,
Duane,
do
you
know
where
we
are?
No.
But
my
guess
And
the
guards,
they're...
-
Laotian.
-
Yeah.
there's
no
question.
Look,
I
know
what
you're
thinking,
but
jungles
on
these
mountains
Besides,
you'd
end
up
in
Vietnam.
-
No,
but
if
we
can
get
to
Thailand...
If
we
can
make
it
to
the
Mekong
River...
Yeah,
the
Big
Muddy.
Yeah.
We
can.
-
Hey,
why
not?
We
can.
Just
stop
talking
about
it.
Okay?
Just
quiet.
Excuse
me.
-
Hey,
Gene.
Which
of
you
guys
knows
most
Oh,
that
would
be
Phisit,
What
do
you
mean?
You
see,
Phisit
is
pissed
about...
About...

He's
pissed
about
something.
We
don't
even
remember


Hey!
Hey!
Hey,
come
back!
Hey!
I
can't
believe
that
bastard
shot
you.
I
know.
I
didn't
even
pull
down
Hey,
look,
when
I
was
standing
We're
gonna
get
even
one
day.

Howdy.

Americali.
-
Americali.

Two
years
ago
a
parcel
came
through.
DUANE:
Yeah.
He
puts
it
on
display
on
really
bad
days.
The
bacon
label
still
looks
greasy.
Does
it
still
have
a
scent
on
it?
Oh,
you
bet.
Can
I
get
a
sniff?
Oh,
no,
you
may
not.
You
may
not.
That
is
my
sniff.
Man,
that
is
my
sniff.
Hey.
How'd
you
ever
end
up
a
pilot?
I
always...
I
always
wanted
to
be
one.
I
was
five
years
old,
or
something,
in
a
little
and
it
was
just
bombed
to
ashes,
No
clear
reason,
But
I
remember
I
was
in
the
attic
We
were
looking
out,
and
we
see
this
fighter
plane,
beautiful,
coming
right
at
us.
And
it's
firing
from
its
wings,
and
I
see
the
machine
gun,

goes
flying
past
the
house.
It's
so
close.
I
mean,
And
the
canopy
was
open.
And
this
pilot,
And
I
could
see
his
eyes.
And
he
was
looking
at
me.
Right
at
me.
He's
looking
right
at
me.
And
as
he
turns
to
go,
he's
starting
back,
And
the
thing
is,
from
that
moment
on,
little
Dieter,
he
needed
to
fly.
You're
a
strange
bird,
Dieter.
Guy
tries
to
kill
you
and
you
want
his
job.
Yeah.
God,
we
need
the
rain.
We
need
the
rain
to
come
quicker.
See,
here's
what
I
can
see,
-
No,
I
understand.
Listen,
now.
Listen.
We
will
be
released
like
I
have
told
you
before...
-
Stop
telling
me.
-
Then
stop
telling
me.
You
understand?
And
here's
what
I'm
starting
to
think,
that
maybe
you're
trying
If
you
try
and
escape,
we,
we
will
be
killed,
-
It's
not
just
me,
we
all
try
to
escape.
for
two
years.
Two
years
before
you
showed
up.
I
don't
want
to
escape

Wait,
wait.

bamboo
and
wood
if
we
weren't
meant
-
Exactly.
-
Exactly.
Why
would
they
do
that
if
they...
-
...
didn't
plan
to
hold
us
a
long
time?
I
am
not,
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
do
that.
No,
no,
no.
You
know
what
I
am
gonna
do?
I
am
gonna
scream.
That's
right.
I
think

'Cause
see,
than
me,
or
any
of
us.
You
understand?
DIETER:
Yeah.
You
understand?
Yeah.
You've
been
warned.
Haven't
you?



Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
This
is

shaving.
Howdy.
-
Man,
I
can't
get
over
it.
No,
that
girl,
you
know?
She
smiled
at
me.
And
when
she
smiled,
man,
did
I
wish
there
was
no
war.
Really.
-
I
thought
you
were
engaged.
We
got
engaged
the
day
before
I
left.
Marina,
she
is
a
wonderful
girl.
She
studies
marine
biology.
But
I
hope
that
she's
waiting
for
me.
-
I'm
sure
she
is.
but,
you
know,
women
can
be
funny

Duane,

Now
listen,

collect
the

must
dry
it
because
it
rots
What?
Hide
it?
You
wanna
hide
it?
-
Yeah,
yeah.
-
No,
no.
Look,
look,
look,
I've
created
It
is
at
the
bottom
of
my
crap
container.
So
I
don't
think
the
guards
-
are
gonna
want
to
check
that.
Why
are
you
hiding
it
now?
For
our
escape.
You
have
a
plan.
DIETER:
Yes.
Now,
have
you
noticed
that
the
guards
when
they
are
called
they
always
leave
So
we
have
a
few
minutes
We
go
out
through
the
hut,
-
we
surprise
them.
-
And
we
surprise...
We
surprise
them...
...and
we
surround
them,
okay?
Then
we
take
the
guards
as
prisoners.
We
take
over
the
camp.
We
hold
it
down
for
a
few
days
to
pick
us
up.

-
Dieter,
quick.
They'll
call
mess
any
second.
Quick,
quick.
-
Who's
in
the
kitchen?
The
cook,
Little
Hitler
and
Nook
the
Rook
He
looks
like
a
villager.
-
DUANE:
What
about
the
rifles?
Little
Hitler's
rifle
And,
okay,
Crazy
Horse
with
his
submachine
gun.
Okay.
There's
somebody
else
coming
up

has
a
machete.
Okay.
Oh,

be...

Bottom
shelf,
raspberry
pie.
The
way
my
mom
makes
it
-
Yeah.
I'm
not
talking
Thanksgiving
big.
I'm
talking,
you
know,
an
obscene,
with
breasts
the
size
of
Jayne
Mansfield's.
You've
got
gravy,
stuffing,
No,
no,
no,
no.
No,
I
prefer
the
Bavarian
stein.
You
know?
With
a
quarter
of
a
gallon
and
you
get
the
foam
lapping
up
-
and
coming
over
the
side.
-
It's
so
cool
you
get
the
mist
on
the
side...
-
This
is
my
fridge.
Right?
-
I'm
sorry.
Go
ahead.
Yeah.
It's
okay.

Muffins.

All

stack
the
fridge.

Sorry.
Go

Go
ahead.

It's
your
turn.
You

Some
cake.
See,

got
to
interrupt
me?

it.
You
did
a
good
job,
trust
me.

DIETER:

When
does
the
monsoon
start?
I
don't
know.
Could
be
another
two
weeks.
-
No,
no,
no,
no.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
-
Maybe
five
days.
We
need
to
set
a
start
date
because
the
guards,
you
know,
And
they
are
getting
I
don't
care
about
anything
else.
-
You
can
stay
behind...
-
...
if
you
want.
-
How
about
that?
Dieter,
I'm
on
board.
I'd
rather
be
dead
out
there
Okay,
buddy.
Okay.
Y.C.,
are
you
on
board?
I
guess
so.
-
Okay.
Procet?
-
You
are
out
of
the
plan?
You're
coming
with
us
out.

That's
a
yes.
So...
So,
it
is
settled
then.
Okay.
July
the
4th.
July
the
4th.
No
matter
what.
Okay.

We
had
this
two
years
ago
-
DIETER:
How
can
it
get
any
worse?
You
don't
ask,
you
just
eat.
You
just
smile,
smile
and
eat.
-
Come
on.
You
got
to
try.
It's
protein.
Protein's
not
gonna
kill
you.
Just
try.
Hey.
I
am
going
to
eat
my
rice.
-
I'm
gonna
eat
my
rice.
GENE:
I'm
gonna
eat
that
rice.
I'm
gonna
eat
that
rice
-
You
are
not.
We're
not
gonna
eat
that
rice.
GENE:
My
rice.
That
is
not
your
rice.
That
is
our
rice.
-
Okay.
And
I
tell
you
what.
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
out
of
Because
I
still
have
the
key.
Oh,
I
see.
I
see.
Let
me
see
if
I
have
this
right.
You're
the
warden
himself
now.
Is
that
right?
Is
that
right?
Okay?
-
DUANE:
Dieter.
-
Dieter.

Oh,
God.
Come
on,
Dieter,
open
the
cuffs.
No.
You,
you
are
on
my
list
right
Cut
that
crap,
you
know?
Because
I
will
do
you
in
two
seconds
flat.
-
Okay.
On
my
list.
That's
right.

No
food.
Go
away,
there's
no
food
today.
No
food.
Dieter.
-
You
should
apologize.
I
was
just
making
a
point.
DUANE:
You
should
apologize
to
Gene.
You
are
not
gonna
keep
me
prisoner.
Oh,
and
you
are
not
the
one
because
the
man
who
will
frighten
me
-
Come
on,
apologize.

Okay.
Gene,
I
apologize.
Gene.
Gene.
Hey,
I'm
really
sorry.
Okay?
I'm
sorry.
Okay.



Motherfucker!

I
think
they
believe
we
call
in
aircraft.
-
DUANE:

I
can't
take
this.
-
You
hang
in.
You
hang
in.
I'm
your
true
friend.
I'm
your
true
friend.
I
would
not
lie
to
you.
I
will
never
let
you
down,
okay?
-
Okay.
-
Okay.
Okay.

Hey.
So,
listen.
Once
we
have
got
the
guards,
we
are
gonna
set
up
a
perimeter.
If
reinforcements
come
along

They're
having
some
kind
of
discussion
I
understand
what
they
are
saying.

Hey,
what's
going
on?
Silence.
So
what
are
they
saying?
What
they're
discussing
is
this.
They
sent
some
villagers
out
-
Yeah?
Ever
since
the
bombings,
I
didn't
think
it
could
get
any
worse.
No,
it's
much
worse
than
that.
They
plan
to
march
us
out
and
make
it
look
They
wanna
all
go
back
to
their
villages
The
ringleaders
are
Little
Hitler
-
I
knew
it.
it
has
to
be
tomorrow.
Come
here.
Procet.
We
are
still
a
day
short
Hey,
there's
no
rain.
Tomorrow,
chow
time.
DIETER:
So
then,
Duane
and
I
will
go
this
way
outside
of
the
fence.
The
four
of
you
will
go
this
And
we
must
all
at
the
same
moment
This
is
the
most
important
thing,
okay?
And
then
you
two,
Okay.
Where
the
hell
is
the
tower?
Where's
the
tower?
Okay.
Yes.
Those
three
are
in
the

think
they're

in
the
kitchen,

think.
This
is
it.
I'm
going.
Dieter,

as
you

hell
happened?
Gene?

the
hell
were
you?
Gene,
where
the
hell
have
you
been?
Did
you
hear
the
shooting?
Did
you?
I
couldn't
get
a
shot.
Oh,
you
couldn't
get
a
shot
at
them.
Look
at
these.
Where
are
our
shoes?
Phisit.
You're
telling
me
that
he
took
He
took
his,
he
took
Duane's
-
That's
right.
-
Yeah.
So,
you
were
busy
getting
your
machetes
and
your
nice
shoes
Okay.
Where
was
this
rifle?
Where'd
you
get
that?
Where
am
I
gonna
go?
I
don't
know
where
you're
gonna
go.
Or
did
you
just
find
that?
We
found
it.
Okay,
listen,
that's
it.
Listen,
I
have
an
ammo
clip
for
you.
My
ammo
clip
for
your
machete.
Oh,
yeah.
DIETER:
Oh,
that's
funny?
-
Why
is
that
funny?
maybe
you'll
go
back
Maybe
I'll
go
back
GENE:
Happy
now
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah,
I
bet
you're
happy.
You
hand
me
that
machete.
You
hand
me
that
machete.
You
tell
me
where
to
go.
You
tell
me
where
to
go.
I
don't
know
where
you
can
go.
I
didn't
think
so.
Didn't
think
so.
Gene.
Gene.
What's
that?
What's
that?
Yeah,
Dieter.
Is
that
where
you're
going?
See
you,
Duane.
Duane,
love
you,
brother.
But
where
am
I
gonna
go?
I'm
gonna
go
over
there.
Where
am
I
gonna
go?
Where
am
I
gonna
go?
Dieter.
It's
gonna
rain.
I
know
it.
This
is
how
it
always
starts.

DIETER:
Duane.
Look
at
this.
You
see
over
there?
See?
Down
there
must
be
a
river.
It
must
lead
to
the
Big
Muddy.
And
then
we'll
be
out
of
here.
DIETER:
We'll
build
a
raft,
and
we
No
one
will
see
us.
Then
we
can
cross

Listen.
Do
you
hear
that?
Is
that
a
waterfall?
Waterfall!
Waterfall,
bail
out!
Dieter!

Dieter!
-
Careful!
Grab
the
shore!
Hey,
pick
a
hand.
No.
Which
one
of
your
feet
is
worse
off?
That's
a
trick
question,
right?
We
can
trade
off
with
this
thing.
DIETER:
There's
no
way
if
we
run
into
them,
so...
And
we
can't
use
these
for
hunting
You
wanna
ditch
them?
Yeah.
I'm
sick
of
carrying
these,
anyway.

Oh,
God.
Duane.
We
got
to
move.
I'm
too
tired.
-
Keep
moving.
Come
on,
buddy.
I
can't
go
on
any
longer.
Duane.
Duane.
These
are
huts.
This
is
an
abandoned
village.
This
is
a
hut.
No.
-
Yeah.
Be
careful.

I'm
done.
DIETER:
Travel
by
night.
No,
I'm
telling
you,
You
just
leave
me
here.
We'll
travel
by
night.
I
help
you
along.
When
we
reach
the
Big
Muddy,
and
I'm
sure
we're
gonna
run
right
And
we're
gonna
go
and
we're
gonna
order
a
burger
and
milkshake
and
ice
cream
sundaes.
All
that
sweet
stuff
that
you
like.

God!
Oh,

Yeah!
Yes!

You
idiots!

killed
me!

I
dreamed
there
was
a
fire.
Why
did
they
think
a
whole
damn
village
How
could
we
be
Vietcong?
Now
they
must've
heard
us.
They
must've
seen
this.
The

will
be
on
their
way.
