When
the
Second
World
War
was
over,
we
were
the
one
great
power
The
Soviets
had
but
they
could
not
touch
us
in
power.
We
had
this
enormous
force
We
had
the
greatest
fleet
We'd
come
through
the
war
And
I
think
that,
in
addition
we
also
began
to
feel...
the-the
sense
of
a
world
power,
that
possibly
we
could
control
Dressed
up
to
win
Dressed
up
for
victory
We
are
just
beginning
Till
the
world
is
free
This
time
we
will
all
make
certain
That
this
time
is
the
last
time
This
time
we
will
not
say
curtains
Till
we
bring
it
down
For
this
time
we
are
out
to
finish
The
job
we
started
then
Clean
it
up
for
all
times
So
we
won't
have
to
do
it
again
Our
vision
of
progress
We
extend
it

French
regulars
land
along
the
coast
For
France,
it
represents
of
manpower
and
financial
resources.
Without
American
help,
I
do
not
expect
that
there
is
going

I
affirm
that
Secretary
Dulles...
offered
me
two
atomic
bombs.
Two,
uh...
Neither
one,
neither
three.
If
Indochina
goes,
The
Accra
Peninsula,
the
little
bit
would
be
scarcely
defensible.
The
tin
and
the
tungsten...
that
we
so
greatly
value
from
that
area
We
don't
see
the
end
of
the
tunnel,
I
don't
think
it's
darker
in
some
ways
lighter.
Yes?
So
we
must
be
ready
but
the
ultimate
victory
and
the
minds
of
the
people
Throughout
the
war
in
Vietnam,
the
United
States
has
exercised
unprecedented





one
small
word
that
enabled
to
stay
alive
those
many
years.
That
one
thing
was
faith.
Faith
in
my
family,
I
remembered
high
school.
And
I
can
remember
''When
the
going
gets
tough,
because
winners
never
quit
Why
did
I
go
to
Vietnam?
I
will
have
to
go
back
to
1965,
At
that
time,
communism
was
once
again
into
a
free
country.

would
assert
that
there's
that
want
to
be
communist.

Because
they
were
subjected
to,
uh,
military
attack
from
outside.
Uh,
the,
uh--
Are
you
really
asking
me
You
really
want
me
to
go
into
this?
I
mean--I
mean,
you
know,
You
just
want
me
to
go
back
All
right,
I'll
do
it,
but
this
is
at
this
late
stage
of
the
game.
Honestly
it
is.
I'll
do
it.
All
right.
-
There's
disagreement
about
the
origins.
No,
there's
not.
All
right,
I'll
answer
your
question,
I
didn't
expect
to
have
to
go
back
but
I'll
do
it.
The
problem,
uh,
began,
uh,
in
its
present
phase,
the
launch
of
the
Sputnik
This
opened
a
phase
but
universally
optimistic
in
many
parts
of
the
world.
Renewed
hostile
actions...

today
required
me
to
order
to
take

always

it's

There
are
those
who
ask
The
answer,
I
think,
is
simple.
There
is
no
one

If
necessary,
We
all
must
be
ready.
You
must
have

or
do

you

I
must

Of

when

gets

I've
been
fighting

I
was
looked
at,
you
know,
as
being,
uh,
you
know,
like
a
warrior
of
sorts,
the
way
my
mother
She
always
spoke
of
and
of
the
different
tribes
around
us
always
had
to
work
to
gain
the
respect
and
how
they
had
to
live,
uh,
by
the
society
that
they
belonged
to,
I-I
looked
around
and
from
listening
they
had
been
in
the
Marine
Corps--
the
Marine
Corps
was
the
hardest
service
And
I
naturally
wanted
to
be
and
I
looked
at

warrior
society

it
might
sound
clich-ish

But
that's

And
during
my
senior
year,
I
said
I've

to

no

physically
and
therefore,

No,
you

What

-

-
I
buy

okay?
No,
no.
No

No.

No.
Go

-
Huh?

You?
Ah,
it's
too

Yeah,
for

No,

If
you

We
thought
of
ourselves,
I
think,
Defeat--Accepting
a
view
of,
uh--
of
covert
aggression
The
kind
of
view
that
enabled
you
in,
really,
World
War
II
terms.
That
was
an
unquestioned
assumption.
It
had
an
idealistic
flavor
to
it,
but
it
was
the
underpinning
of
I
shared
the
assumption,
and
felt
it
as
an
idealistic
one
really.
We
were
doing
something
for
them.
I
recall
that
I
was
in
the
New
York
area
and
I
stopped
by
who
I
had
known
for
several
years.
Uh,
when
he
greeted
me,
he
made,
uh,
He
said,
''Westmoreland,
He
said,
''I
hope
you
appreciate

filled
with
opportunities,
And
indeed,
uh,
It
can
be
described
much
like,
uh...
a-a-a
singer
doing
an
aria...
that's
totally
into
what
he's
doing,
He
knows
the
aria,
And
he
knows
his

and
he
knows
Flying
an
aircraft
What's
a
race
driver
feel
like?
Why
does
a
guy
want
to
drive
I
guess,
perhaps,
the
risk
of
dying,
being
killed
is
part
of
it

I
can
tell
when
the
aircraft
I
can
tell
when
I
can't
or
the
airplane
will
stall,
I
would
follow
a
pathway
on
something
that
would
direct
me

the
steering,
I'd
see
a
little
attack
light
I
could
pull
the
''commit''
switch
and
the
computer
took
over.
A
computer
figured
out
the
ballistics,
and
dropped
the
bombs
in
whichever
kind
of
attack
whether
it
was
flying
straight
and
level
So
it
was
very
much
of
I
was
a
good
pilot,
you
know.
I
had
a
lot
of
pride
You're

even
as

put

in

And
the
excitement,
especially
if
you're
getting

at,
You
get
there,
have
a
real
good

find
out
later
your

that
it
wasn't

of
these

And

back
and

it's
thrilling,

didn't
have

to

If

you
might.
It's,
um,just

What
we

put

was

it's--
it's

we're
gonna
throw
you
And,
uh,
he
couldn't
respond.
They
were
using,
uh,
pigeon
Vietnamese,
It
was
more
English
They'd
run
him
up
to
the
helicopter--
they'd
take
him
by
each
elbow
and
run
They'd
do
this
three
or
four
times.
And
they
finally,
um,
He
still
responded
the
same
way,
and
The
second
fellow
Anything
he
could
tell
them.
Any
kind
of
information
And
that
was
to
reach
the
ground
I
just
can't
see
in
my
mind
somebody
I
don't
believe
this
kind
of
stuff
I
never
saw
it,
put
it
that
way.
I've
seen
G.I.'s
get
mad
and,
uh,
uh,
uh,just
punch
him
right
out,
yeah,


Americans
say
The
Vietnamese
have
We
fight
against
the
invaders.
I
don't
know
where
they
are.
Right
around
and
run
into
the
sewers
They
can
be
anywhere.Just
hopin'
I
just
want
to
go
back
home
-
Have
you
lost
any
friends?
We
lost
one
the
other
day.

The
dude
in
the
foxhole
with
me,
And,
like,
here
come
the
jets.
Get
these
motherfuckers
off
our
ass.''
'Cause
they
were
diggin'
And,
like,
the
jet
came
in
And
you
see
'em
swoopin'
all
around.
And
he
came
over
that
way
And
you
could
see
it's
napalm
cannister,
They
spin
asshole
over
head,
backwards
And
the
thing
is
just
tumbling
down.
You
know.
And,
like,
wow.
just
put
him
up
over
my
head
Fuckin'
napalm
went
down
the
whole
line.
Thirty-five
dudes,
man,just
burnt.
And
that
napalm
was
just
drippin'
on
He's
dead,
you
know.
I'm
just
I
just
chunked
this
dude
off
of
me
I
didn't
know
which
way
I
was
going
And
just
ran
through.
Spent
the
rest
of
the
battle
running
You
ever
try
to
fight
a
battle

Awful
sick
of
it.
I
don't
know.
It's
the
worst
area
we've
You
think
it's
worth
it?
Yeah.
I
don't
know.
They
say
we're
I
was
at
a
very
kind
of
Memorial
service
for
four
men
who
were
killed
the
other
day.
One
of
them
being
a
medic.
And,
uh,
the
place
was
just
packed.
And
we
sang
three
hymns
I
turned
around,
looked
at
their
faces,
I
was
just
proud.
just
soared
because
of
their--
The
way
they
looked.
and-and-and
reverent
But
still
they're

''When
you
go
forth
to
war
and
see
horses
and
chariots
you
shall
not
be
afraid.
''
Well,
let's
not
anybody
in
any
way,
Nor
are
we
here,
to
pray
for
a
victory.
We
believe
in
victory.
We
believe
it
will
come
to
the
team
This
is
serious
business
And
that's
religious,
There
are
going
to
be
men
made
tonight.
And
that's
religious,
We're
concerned
about
the
big
game.
But
we're
also
concerned
the
biggest
game
of
all
May
you
be
winners.
Winners
in
the
big
game.
But
even
more
importantly,
which
we
all
play.
-


Because
we
got
our
kids
-

-
We're
number
one!

You
got
to
tell
them
-
You're
number
one.

-Say
what?
-
Toy
hoy?
Like,
toy
hoy
means,
-
Look
at
the
hickeys
I
gave
this
chick.
-
Yeah.
-
Uh,
one
on
each
side.
-
It's
a
place
where
she
can't
hide
'em.
-
See,
this
one?
I
gave
her
this
one.
And
this
one,
-
It
came
out
kind
of
nasty,
you
know.
-
And--
No
can
do,
I
know.
-
He's
not
dead.
Wake
him
up.
Why?
-
Wakey
him
up.
He
no
hard.
-
Uh-huh.
Hey,
Charles.
This
one's,
uh,
kind
of
sour
on
me,
-
Well,
keep
her
going,
man.
-
Keep
her
going.
You
know
what
it
is
about
like,
they're,
uh--
except
for,
you
know,
-
And,
uh--Right?
You're
number
one.
This
one's
got
This
one
does,
too,
Take
it
off
for
her.
Take
it
off
for
her?
-
That's
the
name
of
the
game.
-

-
Hey.
Hey,
Charles.
Charles.
Yeah?

Ah,you
don't
It
took
you
long
enough,
-
Oh,yeah.
Check
it
out,
baby.
Check
it
out
later?
Mm!
You
know,
if
my
chick
at
home


One
more.


Let's
make
a
quick
check
and
let's
go.
Okay,
well,
hurry
it
up
Some
people
enjoy
it,
Some
just
go
out
and
do
it
as
a
job.
-
What
is
it
for
you?
Now
I
know
that
he
will
have
a

so
I
want
you
all
to
what
he
has
to
say
to
you.

Lieutenant
Coker.
and
unfortunately,
someday
you'll
find
out
Because
the
only
thing
you're
Everything
else
is
unimportant,
because
suddenly
And
that's
what
it's
like
to
be
particularly,
Because
the
thing
that
got
us
through
before
we
were
ten
years
old.
I'd
like
to
open
up
Just
raise
your
hand
or
yell
it
out
and
I'll
do
the
best
I
can
How
did
you
feel
when
How
did
I
feel
I
felt
real
good.
It
was
a
long
war
But
the
reason
we
went
there
I
volunteered
to
go.
And
we
wanted
to
win.
That's
what
we
really
wanted,
And
it
took
us
a
long
time.
we
felt
great;
-
What
did
Vietnam
look
like?
Well,
if
it
wasn't
for
the
people,
Uh,
the
people
over
there
And
they
just
make
a
mess
How
did
you--
What
do
you
feel
about
went
and
burned
their
draft
cards
We
don't
agree
with
them.
I
think
sometimes
they
were
cowards.
If
they
wanted
to
leave
But
they
can't
come
back,
though,
They
say,
''We
don't
like
your
country,
They're
saying
that
''I
don't
like
you,
so
I'm
leaving.''
Well,
fine,
that's
okay.
There's
'Cause
that's
also
his
right,
Instead
of
helping
and
aiding
I
saw
that
we
were
party
to
their
The
Vietnamese
were
considered,
We
called
them
''gooks,''
''slopes.''
Their
lives
weren't
worth
anything
to
us
that
they
were
all
fanatical
or
V.C.
sympathizers,
Many
of
us,
however,
through
our
personal
the
depth
of
the
lies
and
deceptions
and
the
American
people,
It
was
they
who
trained
us
and
to
hate
our
enemy--
They
concocted
such
phrases
''free
fire
zones,''
to
mask
the
reality
I
make
no
apology
I
could
do
nothing
else
But
underground
life
So
I'm
here
today
to
draw
attention
and
the
cases
of
tens
of
thousands
We
are
not
criminals
Over
a
half
million
of
us
Most
of
us
have
already
returned
to
be
punished
with
jail
that
will
be
carried
around
And
it
is
a
supreme
irony
who
planned
and
executed
Now,
inside
this
hearing
room,
Urged
on,
he
says,
by
a
hand-to-mouth
that
still
nags
at
many
who
continue
to
look
Paul
Udell,
-
How
was
your
sound?

-
Let
me
respectfully
that
this
is
their
dirtiest
The
Vietnamese
fight
Ultimately,
the
Americans
If
not,
they
will
defeat
themselves.
You
know,
Vietnam,
uh,
the
developing
of
a
child.
The
laws
of
nature
control
A
child
has
to
sit
up
It
has
to
crawl
It
has
to
walk
before
it
runs.


No
matter
how
it
will
never
conquer
Vietnam,
never.
I'm
telling
you
so
that
you
will
go
back
Over
here,
as
long
as
there
is
And
if
the
rice
runs
out,
then
we'll
I
know
very
little
about
it
And
the
less
I
know,
It
has
not
affected
me
a
whole
lot.
I
mean,
the
American--
And
if
you
work
for
it,
We're
taught
that
we're
and
I
would
have
to
go
Once
in
a
while,
but
I
like
to
think
about
the
things
I
don't
it's
affected
mine
at
all.
I
don't
even
know
who
we're
fighting
for
I
think
we're
fighting


I
fled
from
Dau
Tien
Then
I
was
allowed
to
go
back,
and
stayed
in
Ben
Chua.
While
I
was
in
Ben
Chua,
So
I
was
taken
up
to
Co
Tach.
I
was
picked
up
again
to
be
lumped
together
My
house
burned
down
Once
more,
I've
fled
five,
six,
The
lives
of
my
countrymen
You
take
it
and
swat
it
dead...
just
like
that.

a

breaks,

of
what

People
in
America


including
an
insurance
company
We
are
in
the
hotel
business,
We
are
the
exclusive
dealer
Oh,
many,
many
other
things,
like,
uh,
an
oil
company
in
the
forming.
We,
uh,
have
a
bottling
company.
we
greatly--we
greatly
believe
and,
uh,
we
think
And,
uh,
we
think
will
not
go
communist,
because
otherwise,
And
the
way
we
work
If
we
don't
lose
South
Vietnam
then
nobody
can
catch
up
with
us.
I'm
a
Johnny-come-lately
as
far
Uh,
the
reason
why
I...
uh,
organized
this
group
of
companies
I
saw
that
peace
was
coming,
Therefore,
I
got
home
All
these
companies
have
been
organized
and
prepare
for
the
economic
takeoff
We
have
the
infrastructure
of
hotels,
But,
of
course,
there
are
no
tourists
And,
uh,
we
are
getting


There's
a
star-spangled
banner
Waving
somewhere
-
Was
it
worth
the
trouble?
So
far
across
the
sea
It's
waving
for
the
ones
Who
fought
and
died
there
And
for
those
Only
Uncle
Sam's
great
heroes
Get
to
go
there
-
Stand
up.
For
there
to
be

Keep
it
flat.
Now
try
to
walk.
'Cause
it's
waving
there
-For
you
and
for
me
Well,
it
really
isn't
that
much.
We
were
walking
on
a
patrol
About
six,
seven
guys
Ran
into
a
battalion
ambush,
And
it
was
supposed
to
be
one
And
we
called
in
two
or
three
medivacs,
So,
finally,
the
last
one
From
that,
I
never
saw
any
of
the
others
And
that
was
about
it.
Most
of
the
guys
I
keep
in
touch
with
They
usually
have
a
reunion

That's
about
it.
There's
really
Here
we
are
for
one
thing
that
we
said,
I
don't
care
I
don't
care
about
anything
now.
The
one
thing
that
we
wanna
show
is
that
we
come
down
And
what
the
piss
you
doing?
Get
going!
Don't
let
'em
beat
us!
Let's
go!
Come
on!
Go!
-
Go,
go,
go,
go!


Defense,

Defense,
defense,

Make
no
mistake
about
it.
I
don't
want
a
man
in
here...
to
go
back
home
We
are
going
to
win.

Go,
motherfucker!
Go!

Don
North,
ABC
news,
I
know
that,
as
was
the
case
in
that
after
the
enemy
exposed
himself,
He
would
be
weakened,
Through
the
use
of,
uh,
the
maximum
military
force
through
the
bombing,
through
the
cutting

have
no

but
to

General
Westmoreland
We
met
hour
after
hour
And
I
started
in
and
asked
''How
long
do
you
think
that
None
of
them
knew.
''Uh,
do
you
think
that
Nobody
knew.
''Uh,
might
we
have
to
send
more
men?''
''Well,
in
six
months?''
''Ayear?
Eighteen
months?''
I
couldn't
get
answers
By
the
end
of
that
I
was
getting
down--by
the
end
of
it--
''Do
any
of
you
men,
do
you
find
any
diminution
Well,
they
said,
''Are
they
sending
the
same
number
of
men
''Well,
yes,
and
even
''And
how
about
our
bombing?
We've
placed
Is
our
bombing
stopping
them?''
''Well,
what
is
the
amount
of
attrition
''Well,
maybe
10
to
15
percent.''
So
I
remember
''If
a
North
Vietnamese
field
commander
They
said,
''Yes.''
''If
he
asked
for,
say,
1,200
men,
1,000
would
get
through?''
''Well,
that's
right.''
''Then
he'd
have
the
thousand
he
needed.''
Well,
this
type
of
interrogation--
Finally,
by
the
end
I
must
say
that
my
thinking...
had
undergone
All
we
are
saying
Is
give
peace
a
chance
All
we
are
saying
Is

All
we

As
long
as
is
commander
in
chief...
of
the
biggest
war
machine
with
bases
on
every
continent,
we
are
going
to
get
into
trouble.
Our
enemy
is
the
growing
militarization
Our
enemy
And
there
is
an
awakening.
The
enemy
was
on
the
ropes
And
it's
like
two
boxers
One
boxer
has
the
other
one
but
the
man
has
his
second
Accordingly,
I
shall
not
seek...
and
I
will
not
accept...
the
nomination
of
my
party
I
don't
think
we
helped
'em
one
bit.
All
I
think
we've
done
is
No.
I
don't
think
we
helped
'em.
As
fellow
human
beings,
I
don't
think
Certainly
a
mature
person
Why
can't
a
government?
You
let
us
all
go
off
to
war
and
said,
and
all
this
kinda
shit
Now
1

comes
along
and
''Boo,

''And
don't
say
nothin'
about
it,
'cause
it's
upsetting
Well,
Goddamn.
It
upset
me
It
upset
a
lot
of
people
to
the
point
All
this
shit.
You
don't
wanna
Make
you
sit
out
Because
you
got
me
over
there,
and
you
wanna
forget
it
so
somebody
else
Hell
no.
Uh-uh.
Every
day
as
long
as
you

When
I
get
up
in
the
morning,
when
a
lot
of

sitting
here
get
up,
man,
their
gut
hurts
I
gotta
put
on
an
arm
and
a

Now,
my
man's
got
a
hole
in
his
stomach.
You
do
something
about
that.
Make
it
all
go
away
with
the
6:00
news.
Turn
it
off
or
switch
it
Uh-Uh.
To
hell
with

dig?
And
it's
gonna
happen
again
and
realize
it
has
happened.

Power

The
country
is

The
people
have
judged,
I
think,
and
not
in
the
national
interest
and
that,
therefore,

For
20
years,
first
the
French,
had
been
predicting
victory
in
Vietnam.
In
1961
and
in
1962,
as
well
as
1966
and
1967,
we
have
been
told
there
is
a
light
we
can
soon
bring
our
troops
home,
victory
is
near,
the
enemy
is
tiring.
Once,
in
1962,
I
participated
But
for
20
years,
The
history
of
conflict
does
not
record
another
such
lengthy
as
we
have
shown
in
Vietnam.
I
had
just
given
the
policy
line,
stayed
up
all
night
with
helping
on
a
speech
which
proved
to
be
his
last
speech
to
a
businessman's
luncheon
on
Vietnam.
Uh,
I
went
up
with
some
corrections
and
shook
hands
with
him
And
then
he
came
down
from
We
were
struck
with
how
easy
and
approach
him
at
that
point.
At
the
conference
of
course,
in
the
morning
I
learned
Well--
So--
So,
uh--
Well,
that
was
a
way

So,
um,
it
began
to
look
as
if
there
was
no
way




We'd
been
going
and
I
had
felt
so
strongly
before
that
it
was
difficult
I
know
now
that
the
domino
theory
I
know
now
that
we
should
not
As
far
as
I'm
concerned
today,
I
have
no
hesitancy
in
saying
I
could

upstairs,
and
he's
saying,
''Take
the
hill,
So
I
got
together
and
I
said,
and
we'll
walk
the
A.R.V.N.
And
we'll
lay
down
a
base
of
fire
He
says,
''Okay.''
I
got
with
the
A.R.V.N.
So
I
popped
up
and,
uh,
started
to
go
up
the
hill.
And
everything
was
cool,
And,
uh,
the
A.R.V.N.
started
to
split.
And
that's
when
I
got
it.
I
said,
''Oh,
my
God.
I'm
hit.''
''I
can't
believe
it.
I'm
really
hit.''
And
my
first,
first
thought...
was
Kay,
my
girl,
you
know?

but
I'm--but
my
thought
was
You
know,
here
I
was
dying
and
I
was
But
then
I
realized
that
I
didn't
It's
all
over.
My
last--
was
''I
can't
believe
it.
On
this
shitty
piece
of
ground,
and
I
can't
fuckin'
believe
it.''
Bobby
was
a
surfer,
he
was
a
long-distance
runner.
We
danced.
He
was
active.
Our
whole
life
was
active.
And
now
they're
telling
me
He
couldn't
believe
it
Bobby's
not
a
boyfriend.
It-It's
very--

It's
very
hard.

and
this
is
a
purely
personal
thing,
Right,
wrong
or
indifferent,
When
I
was
in
the
Marine
Corps,
I
remember
I
was
in
the
Marine
Corps
They
call
it
And
they
had
And
I
was
standing
at
attention
and
they
were
playing
And
then
they
played
And
I
actually
started
to
cry.
I
cried
because
I
was
so
proud
And
I
was
so
proud
and
in
uniform,
That-That
represented
in
the
way
of
life
and--
That's
gone,
you
know?
And
that
hurt.
That's
what
I'm
bitter
about.
Johnny,
get
your
gun
Take
it
on
the
run
Hear
them
calling
you
and
me
Every
son
of
liberty
Over
there,
over
there
Send
the
word
That
the
yanks
are
coming
The
drums
rum-tumming
everywhere
So
prepare,
say
a
prayer
Send
the
word
We'll
be
over
And
we
won't
come
back

Ha!
Didn't
think
we
were
here,
We're
still
here!
So
prepare,
say
a
prayer
Send
the
word
We'll
be
over
And
we
won't
come
back
Truman
lied
from
1
950
on...
on
the
nature
and
purposes
the
colonial
reconquest
of
Vietnam...
that
we
were
financing
Eisenhower
lied
and
the
nature
and
the
fact
that
he
was
in
power,
because
of
American
support,
Kennedy
lied
about
the
type
our
own
combat
involvement,
and
about
the
recommendations
that
were
President
Kennedy
lied
about...
the
degree
of
our
participation
The,
um,--Johnson,
of
course,
about
our
provocations
prior
to
and
after
about
the
plans
and
the
nature
of
the
buildup...
of
American
troops
in
Vietnam.
Nixon,
as
we
now
know,
misled
and
lied
for
the
first
months
of
his
office
and
of
Laos,
the
reasons
for
our
invasion
and
the
prospects
for
the
mining
but
was
envisioned
The
American
public
by
each
of
these
As
I
say,
it's
a
tribute
that
their
leaders
perceived
It's
no
tribute
to
us
We
have
adopted
a
plan...
which
we
have
worked
out
in
cooperation
for
the
complete
withdrawal
and
their
replacement
on
an
orderly,
This
withdrawal
will
be
made
As
South
Vietnamese
forces
the
rate
of
American
withdrawal


on
your
recent
victories
We
ask
ourselves,
And
I
tell
you,
if
you
chase
there
won't
be
any
war
Help
rebuild
the
houses.
Help
the
people.
Rid
the
hamlet
of
all
V.C...
so
there
will
be
no
more
suffering
for
ourselves
-

Oh,
my
friend.
-
How
you
doing?
Good
to
see
you
again.
-
Yeah.
How
you
doing,
men?
How
you
doing?
-
Good
to
see
you,
sir.
Just
came
in
this
afternoon,
sir.
-
Except
last
time,
when
the,
uh--
-

Very
nice.
That's
one
of
our
success
stories
here,
We
had
a
real,
uh--
We
just
gave,
uh,
and
five
Ar-Comms
to
a
battalion
commander
and
And
we
have
six
N-pac
awards...
pending
for
where
we
killed
six
V.C.
Good
grief.
He
had
been
the
recon
and
he'd
done
a
real
tremendous
job
And
then
they
moved
him
over
here.
In
a
ten-day
period
or
two-week
period,
They
had
the
battalion
here
They
had
it
to
the
point
were
throwing
down
their
weapons
Ten
days
later
they
had
and
in
3
days
killed
42,
He
does
it
with
a
fairly
limited
staff.
Although
some
of
his
people,
tremendous
guy.
He
just
heard
his
name
over
there.

It's
no
surprise
you
can
find
people
What
has
always
surprised
us,
what
we've
never
been
willing
is
that
the
Vietnamese
can
find
enough
people
fight
for
nothing
year
after
year
A
war
in
which
one
side
and
equipped
and
supported
is
not
a
civil
war.
The
only
foreigners
were
the
foreigners
we
financed
and
the
foreigners
we
were
Basically,
the
scale
of
our
involvement
there.
We
didn't
want
to
realize
because
that
would
have
been
to
say
was
a
casualty
The
question
used
to
be
''Might
it
in
the
Vietnamese
War?''
We
weren't
on
the
wrong
side.
We
are
the
wrong
side.
You
have
exemplified,
patriotism
of
the
highest
order.
You
have
brought
to
your
great
task
the
greatest
of
courage,


Either
I
could
submit
Every
morning,
''Yes,
sir.''

You
can
be
sure
that
as
a
soldier
And,
in
fact,
never.
I
chose
the
second
solution,
On
the
Vietnamese
side,
I
would
say
the
most
is
the
promise
offered


Through
a
security
we
taped
all
communications
All
telephone
communications.
And
fortunately,
among
these
I
still
have
the
tape
General
Taylor...
stating
precisely
that
he
wants
me,
to
leave
Vietnam.
-
Can
you
let
us
hear
it?

-
General
Taylor.
How
are
you?
Uh,
uh,
may
I
speak
in
French?
Mr.
President
as
our
joint
communique
indicates,
President
Thieu
and
I
have
with
regard
to
how
we
shall
working
for
the
program
of
peace,
which
we
now
hope
not
only
for
the
Republic
of
Vietnam,
but
for
all
of
the
countries

What
kind
of
freedom
when
you
put
so
many
without
any
charge,
Just
because
you
want
us
What
kind
of
freedom
We
know
that
we
only
have
freedom
But
here
we
fight
for
what?
We
fight
for
prisons?


People
can
be
arrested
And
then
tortured
in
inhuman
ways
And,
above
all,
in
police
stations.
And
then
imprisoned
Their
only
crime
They
had
the
courage
They
asked
for
the
liberation
They
asked
for
an
end
to
the
war.
They
asked
for
peace,
And
all
that
is
considered
a
crime


I
was
at
home
They
took
me
to
headquarters
and
kept
me.
You
can't
imagine
Mostly
on
the
head.
After
I
was
arrested,
even
now
and
nosebleeds
and
ear-bleeds.
In
those
days,
all
we
were
so
we
asked
But
when
we
complained,
and
lime
powder
And
they
poured
water
on
us,
Our
cells
were
this
big...
and
we
could
do
nothing
and
get
the
water
Some
of
us
lost
our
teeth
And
when
the
lime
got
wet,
Our
hair
fell
out
and
our
skin
They
said
that
they
would
beat
us
and
that
if
we
were
guilty,
they
would
beat
us
In
a
country
where
the
people
in
a
country
where
to
be
the
enemy
of
the
people,
the
prisoners
are
the
patriots.

And
no
matter
still
we
are
proud,
because
at
least
we
are
free,
instead
of
enslaved
as
so
many


when
a
Vietnamese
works
he
is
considered
a
communist.
It
is
an
honor
for
the
communists
So
it
is
the
government
which
because
they
continue
to
say...
that
the
people
who
work
forjustice
You
see?

back
when
you're
three,
four,
That's
when
good
ol'mom
is
telling
you
In
this
case,
it's
the
house.
And
you
start
to
learn
And
so,
finally,
lo
and
behold,
you
find
yourself
in
service
where
you
become
in
a
military
form
of
discipline.
That
stuff
isn't
worth
the
paper
it's
You
need
that
cornerstone
that
goes
back
but
good
old
moms,
It's
terrifying.
When
you're
facing
it's
gonna
be
pretty
darn
miserable.
No
doubt
about
it.
But
at
the
other
side,
telling
you,
''You
better
do
something,''
That's
the
wrath
of
God.
You
don't
-
So
you
press
on.
In
many
respects,
and
more
personally,
your
men,your
children...
is
in
your
hands.
If
you
are
proud
of
the
P.O.
W.s
then
you
should
be
because
I
was
As
for
my
own
view,
uh,
I
thought
through
the
meaning
of
Southeast
Asia
looking
backward
in
terms
of
what
I
know
about
And
on
balance--
I
came
to
the
judgment
that
it's
I've
never
had
any
reason
And,
uh,
therefore,
I,
uh,
I
do
believe
that
what
we
have
done
although
I
would
have
preferred
more
decisive
military
strategy.
Certainly,
to
me,
the
day
you
can
say
that
a
sacrifice
is
the
day
that
you've
destroyed
of
what
is
worthwhile
And
there's
no
question
in
my
mind...
that
he
and
everybody
else
there's
no
sacrifice
that
is
in
vain.
Absolutely
none.
Down
the
line,
and
that's
the
price
that
you
pay
and
it's
the
kind
of
risk
you
take...
to
preserve
the
ideals
that
we
have.
He
had
just
a
tremendous
and
just
an
amazing,
instinctive
sense
I
remember
when
I
was
getting
ready
and
I
was
upset
because
and
he
called
up
from
Pensacola
And
I
said,
''Fine,
Bing,
He
said,
''Oh,
Mom,

You
know,
I
thought,
''Gee.
That
really
And
it
was.
Yeah.
And
it
made
the
whole
thing
And,
of
course,
I
came
up
in
a
tradition
In
World
War
II,
there
was
no
question
There
was
not
the
kind
that
there
has
been
surrounding
But
I
think
that
most
of
the
people
are
too
busy
in,
uh,
uh,
on,
uh,
the
kind
of
things
In
other
words,
I
think
that
really
and
I
think
it's
a
terrific
system,
is
that
you
do
rely
on
somebody
I
think
his
team
of
people
with
him
and,
to
me,
and
decisions
uh,
really
have--
I
would
expect
from
And
the
action
he
has
taken
from
the
president
of
this
country.
I
think
the
whole
executive,
legislative
and
judicial
system
It
has
worked
many,
many--
far
better
and
brought
us
and,
uh,
really,
that
we
have
a
responsibility


What
did
your
son
I
suspect
he
would
have
He
actually
had
just
got
a
job
when
he
went
And
he'd
worked
for
newspapers
while
he
was
at
college.
I
suppose
that
You
don't
remember
pain
too
well...


Thank
you.
Thank
you
very
much,
I'm
thrilled
to
be
here
with
you
guys.


It
is
always
the
custom
to
have
a
toast
The
difficulty
tonight
is
that
that
we
would
be
drinking

Somebody
just
said,
The
most
difficult
decision
that
was
on
December
the
1
8th
of
last
year.
-


And
there
were
many
occasions...
in
the
1
0-day
period
when
I
wondered
whether
But
I
can
tell
you
this:
After
having
met
each
one
and
after
having
talked
to
them,
I
think
that
all
of
us...
would
like
to
join
for
the
brave
men
that







And
my
three-year-old
son.


What
have
I
done
to
Nixon
so
that
My
daughter
died
right
here.
She
was
feeding
the
pigs.
She
was
so
sweet.
She
is
dead.
My
mother
and
my
children
Here
they
died.
The
planes
came
from
over
there.
No
targets
here.
Only
rice
fields
and
houses.
I'll
give
you
Take
it
back
Tell
them
what
happened
here.
My
daughter
is
dead.
She
will
never
wear
the
shirt
again.
Throw
the
shirt
in
Nixon's
face.
Tell
them
she
was

[
Sobbing,



Well,
the
Oriental...
doesn't
put
the
same
high
price
on
life
Life
is
plentiful,
And,
uh,
as
the,
uh,
philosophy
of
the,
uh,
uh,
expresses
it,
uh,
uh,
life
is,
uh,
is
not
important.
During
the
missions,
the
result
of
what
I
was
doing...
the
result
of
this-this
game,
this,
uh,
exercise
never
really
dawned
on
me.
That
reality
of
the
screams
or
their
homeland
being
destroyed,
uh,just
was
not
a
part
-




Uh,
we,
as
Americans,
We've
never
experienced


When
I
was
there,
I
never
saw
I
didn't
drop
napalm,
I
dropped
C.B.U.s,
which
can't
destroy
anything.
It's
meant
for
people.
We
used
to
drop
canister
upon
canister
with
200
tumbling
little
balls
in
there
with
something
like
that
would
blow
out
uh,
and
shred
people
to
pieces.
They
couldn't
be
gotten
out
People
would
suffer.
They
would
live,
Then
often
they
would
die
afterwards.
This
would
cause
people
But
I
look
at
my
children
now...
and,
uh,
I
don't
know
uh,
what
I
would
think
about


Do
you
think
we've
learned
I
think
we're
trying
not
to.
I
think
I'm
trying
not
to
sometimes.
I
can't
even
cry
easily.
From
my,
uh,

We've
all
tried
very
hard...
to
escape
to
not
come
to
the
logical
conclusions
You
know,
the
military
They
don't
realize
that,
um,
people
fighting
uh,
are
not
gonna
be
stopped...
by
just
changing
your
tactics,
adding
a
little
bit
more
improving

tactics
not
making
Uh,
you
know,
I
think

operates
And
I
think
that
