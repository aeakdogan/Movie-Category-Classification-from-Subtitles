With

Lisbon
became
But
not
everybody
could

so
a
torturous,
roundabout
Paris
to
Marseilles...
...
across
the
Mediterranean
to
Oran.
Then,
by
train
or
auto
or
foot,
...
to
Casablanca
in
French
Morocco.
Here,
the
fortunate
ones,

might
obtain
exit
visas
And
from
Lisbon
to
the
New
World.
But
the
others
wait
in
Casablanca.
And
wait

and
wait.

To
all

May
we
see
your
papers?
I
don't
think
I
have
them
on
me.
-
In
that
case,
you'll
have
to
come
along.
Yes.
Here
they
are.
These
papers
expired
three
weeks
ago.
Halt!
Halt!

-
What
on
earth
is
going
on
there?
Pardon,
monsieur.
Pardon,
Madame.
We
hear
very
little,
Two
German
couriers

unoccupied

This
is
the
customary
roundup
...and,
of
course,
a
beautiful
young
girl
Along
with
these
unhappy
refugees...
...the
scum
of
Europe
Some
of
them
have
been
waiting
I
beg
of
you,
monsieur,
watch
yourself.
This
place
is
full
of
vultures.
Vultures
everywhere.
Everywhere!
-
Thank
you.
Thank
you
very
much.
-
Au
revoir,
Madame.
What
an
amusing
little
fellow.
Waiter.

Oh,
how
silly
of
me.
I've
left
my
wallet
in
the
hotel.

Perhaps
tomorrow

Major

That
is
kind
of
you.

You
may
find
the
climate
We
Germans
must
get
used
to
all
Perhaps
you
What
else?
The
murder
of
the
couriers.
My
men
are
rounding
up

we
know
already

Is
he
in
custody?
No
hurry.
Tonight
he'll
be
at
Rick's.
I've
already
heard
about
this
caf.


Waiting,
waiting,
waiting.
I'll
never
get
out
of
here.
I'll
die
in
Casablanca.
But
can't

a
little
more?
Please?

you

Excuse
me.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
Of
all
the
nerve.
Who
do
you
think..?
-
You
dare
not
keep
me
out.
I
have
been
in
every
gambling
room
And
if
you
think
I'm
going
to
be
kept
out
...you're
much
mistaken.
Excuse
me,
please.
Your
cash
is
good
at
the
bar.
What?
Do
you
know
who
I
am?
I
do.
You're
lucky
the
bar
is
open
to
you.
This
is
outrageous!
Watching
you
just
now,
one
would

What
makes
you
think
I
haven't?
-
But
when
you
first
came,
I
thought...
What
right
do
I
have
to
think?
May
I?
Too
bad
about
those
two
They
got
a
lucky
break.
...today
they
are
the
honored
dead.
You
are
a
very
cynical
person,
Rick,
I
forgive
you.
-
Will
you
have
a
drink
with
me?
I
forgot,
you
never
drink
with...
You
despise
me,
don't
you?
If
I
gave
you
any
thought,
But
why?
Do
you
object
But
think
of
all
those
poor
refugees
who
That's
not
so
bad.
Through
ways
of
For
a
price,
Ugarte.
For
a
price.
But
think
of
all
the
poor
devils
I
get
it
for
them
for
half.
I
don't
mind
a
parasite.
Well,
after
tonight
I
will
be
through
And
I'm
leaving,
finally,
Who
did
you
bribe
for
your
visa?
Myself.
Look,
Rick.
Know
what
this
is?
Something
that
even
you

be
rescinded.
One
moment.
Tonight
I'll
be
selling
those
And
then,
addio,
Casablanca.
I
have
many

friend
in
Casablanca,
...just
because
you
despise
me,
Will
you
keep
these
for
me,
please?
-
For
how
long?
-
I
don't
want
them
here
overnight.
Please
keep
them
for
me.
Thank
you.
Waiter.
I'll
be
expecting
some
people.
If
anybody
asks
for
me,
Rick...
...I
hope
you're
more
impressed
If
you'll
forgive
me,
I'll
share
my
Just
a
moment.
I
heard
a
rumor
those
two
German
Huh?
Oh.
I've
heard
that
You're
right,
Ugarte.


-
Hello,
Rick.
How's
business
at
the
Blue
Parrot?
-
Fine,
but
I'd
like
to
buy
your
caf.
-
You
haven't
heard
my
offer.
-
What
do
you
want
for
Sam?
Too
bad.
In
refugees
alone
...if
you'd
work
with
me
Suppose
you
run
your
business
Suppose
we
ask
Sam.
Suppose
we
do.
When
will
you
realize
...isolationism
is
no
longer
Sam,
Ferrari
wants
you
to
work
for
him
Oh,
I
like
it
fine
here.
He'll
double
what
I
pay
you.
I
ain't
got
time
to
spend
Sorry.
The
boss's
private
stock...
...because,
Yvonne,
I
love
you.
All
right,
all
right.
For
you,
I
shut
up,
Uh-oh.
Oh,
Monsieur
Rick,
Monsieur
Rick.
Some
Germans
gave
this
check.
Where
were
you
last
night?
That's
so
long
ago,
-
Will
I
see
you
tonight?
Give
me
another.
-
Sascha,
she's
had
enough.
Yvonne,
I
love
you,
-
Rick,
I'm
tired
of
having
you...
-
We're
gonna
get
your
coat.
You're
going
home.
Hey,
taxi.
Who
do
you
think
you
are,
I
was
a
fool
Go
with
her,
Sascha.
-
And
come
right
back.
-
Hello,
Rick.
How
extravagant
you
are,
Someday
they
may
be
scarce.
I
think
now
I
shall
pay
a
call
on
Yvonne.
Maybe
get
her
on
the
rebound.
When
it
comes
to
women,

If
he
gets
a
word
in,

The
plane
to
Lisbon.
You
would
like
to
be
on
it?
Why?
What's
in
Lisbon?
The
clipper
to
America.
I've
often
speculated
on
why
Did
you
abscond
with
the
church
funds?
I
like
to
think
you
killed
a
man.
It's
a
combination
of
all
three.
And
what
in
heaven's
name
My
health.
The
waters?
What
waters?
-
I
was
misinformed.
EMIL:
A
gentleman
inside
...and
the
cashier
I'll
get
it
from
the
safe.
I'm
so
upset,
Rick.
You
know
I...
Forget
it,
Emil.
Mistakes
like
that
EMIL:
Rick,
there
will
be
some
excitement
-
Again?
A
murderer,
no
less.
If
you're
thinking
of
warning
him,
don't
-
I
stick
my
neck
out
for
nobody.

Could
have
made
the
arrest
earlier,
Out
of
my
regard
for
you,
It
will
amuse
your
customers.
Our
entertainment's
enough.
We're
to
have
an
important
guest
Major
Strasser
We
want
him
to
be
here
A
demonstration
of
the
efficiency
RICK:
I
see.
He
certainly
didn't
come
here
to
witness
-
Perhaps
not.
-
It
shall
not
happen
again.
Louis,
you
got
something
on
your
mind.
How
observant
you
are.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
Yeah?
-
Have
a
brandy?
There
are
many
exit
visas
...but
we
know
That
is
the
reason
I
thought
it
was
because
That
is
another
reason.
There
is
a
man
arrived
in
Casablanca
He
will
offer
a
fortune
to
anyone
-
What's
his
name?
Victor
Laszlo?
Rick,
that
is
the
first
time
He's
succeeded
in
impressing
It's
my
duty
to
see
that
Laszlo
must
never
reach
America.
It'll
be
interesting
-
Manages
what?
-
But
I
just
told
you...
He
escaped
from
a
concentration
camp.
The
Nazis
have
chased
him
-
This
is
the
end
of
the
chase.
Is
that
a
serious
offer?
I
just
paid
out
20,
Make
it
10.
-
Okay.
No
matter
how
clever
he
is,
he
still
-
Why
two?
-
He'll
take
one.
And
if
he
did
not
leave
her
...he
certainly
won't
leave
her
Maybe
he's
not
quite
It
doesn't
matter.
What
ever
gave
you
the
impression
Because,
my
dear
Ricky,
...you
are
at
heart
a
sentimentalist.
Laugh
if
you
will,
but
I
happen
Let
me
point
out
just
two
items:
In
1935,
you
ran
guns
to
Ethiopia.
In
1936,
you
fought
in
Spain
And
got
well
paid
for
it
The
winning
side
would
-
Maybe.
It
seems
you're
determined
I
have
my
orders.
I
see.
Gestapo
spank.
My
dear
Ricky,
you
overestimate
I
don't
interfere
with
them,
In
Casablanca,
I
am
master
of
my
fate.
-
I
am...
-
You
were
saying?
Carl,
see
that
Major
Strasser
I
have
already
given
him
the
best...
...knowing
he
is
German
Take
him
quietly.
Yes,
sir.
-
Everything
is
ready,
sir.
-
Good
evening,
gentlemen.
-
Won't
you
join
us?
-
It's
a
pleasure
to
have
you
here,
major.
May
I
recommend
Veuve
Clicquot
'26,
-
Thank
you.
-
A
very
interesting
club.
In
a
few
minutes
you'll
see
the
arrest
I
expected
no
less,
captain.
Monsieur
Ugarte.
Oh.
Yes?
-
Will
you
please
come
with
us?
May
I
first
please
cash
my
chips?

Very
lucky,
huh?
Two
thousand,
please.
Thank
you.

Rick!
Rick,
help
me!
-
Don't
be
a
fool.
You
can't
get
away.
Excellent,
captain.
When
they
come
for
me,
I
stick
my
neck
out
for
nobody.
I'm
sorry
there
was
a
disturbance,
folks,
Just
sit
down
and
have
a
good
time.
Okay,
boss.

RENAULT:
Rick,
this
is
Major
Heinrich
Strasser
-
How
do
you
do,
Mr.
Rick?
You
already
know
Herr
Heinze
Please
join
us,
Mr.
Rick.
We
are
very
honored
tonight.
Major
Strasser
is
one
of
the
reasons
the
You
repeat
Third
Reich
as
though
Well,
personally,
major,
Do
you
mind
-
Unofficially,
of
course.
-
What
is
your
nationality?
And
that
makes
Rick
a
citizen
I
was
born
in
New
York
City,
I
understand
you
came
here
from
Paris
There
seems
to
be
no
secret
about
that.
Are
you
one
of
those
people...
...who
cannot
imagine
the
Germans
It's
not
particularly
my
beloved
Paris.
Can
you
imagine
us
in
London?
When
you
get
there,
ask
me.
Diplomatist.
How
about
New
York?
Well,
there
are
...that
I
wouldn't
advise
Uh-huh.
-
Who
do
you
think
will
win
the
war?
Rick
is
completely
neutral
And
that
takes
in
the
field
You
were
not
always
We
have
a
complete
dossier
on
you.
"Richard
Blaine,
American.
Age:
37.
The
reason
is
a
little
vague.
And
also
we
know
why
you
left
Paris.
Don't
worry,
Are
my
eyes
really
brown?
You
will
forgive
my
curiosity,
...an
enemy
of
the
Reich
...and
we
are
checking
up
on
anybody
My
interest
in
whether
Victor
Laszlo
In
this
case
you
have
no
sympathy
Not
particularly.
I
understand
Laszlo
published
the
foulest
lies
...until
the
day
we
marched
in.
And
even
after
that,
he
continued
Of
course,
one
must
admit
I
admit
he's
clever.
Three
times
In
Paris
he
continued
his
activities.
Excuse
me,
gentlemen.
Your
business
Good
evening,
Mr.
Blaine.
You
see,
major?
Perhaps.
Yes,
monsieur?
-
I
reserved
a
table.
Victor
Laszlo.
Two
Cointreaux,
please.
I
saw
no
one
of
Ugarte's
description.
Victor,
I
feel
somehow
If
we
would
walk
out
so
soon
Perhaps
Ugarte
is
in
Excuse
me,
but
you
look
like
a
couple
Well?
You'll
find
a
market
there
for
this
ring.
-
Thank
you,
but
I
hardly
think...
The
ring
is
quite
unique.
-
Yes,
I'm
very
interested.
What
is
your
name?
Berger,
Norwegian.
Victor.
I'll
meet
you
in
a
few
minutes
We
don't
want
the
ring,
BERGER:
Such
a
bargain.
I'm
sorry,
it
is.
-
Monsieur
Laszlo,
is
it
not?
I
am
Captain
Renault,
Yes,
what
is
it
you
want?
Merely
to
welcome
you
to
Casablanca
It
isn't
often
we
have
Thank
you.
The
present
French
administration
May
I
present
Miss
Ilsa
Lund.
I
was
told
you
were
the
most
beautiful
That
was
a
gross
understatement.
You're
very
kind.
-
Won't
you
join
us?
Oh,
no,
Emile,
please.
A
bottle
of
your
-
Captain,
please.
They
put
it
on
the
bill,
Captain,
Somewhere
I've
seen
him.
RENAULT:
Sam?
He
came
from
Paris
with
Rick.
Rick?
Who
is
he?
Mademoiselle,
you
are
in
Rick's.
-
Is
what?
...he's
the
kind
of
man
that,
...and
I
were
not
around,
But
what
a
fool
I
am
talking
to
a
Excuse
me.
Major.
Mademoiselle
Lund
and
Monsieur
Laszlo,
How
do
you
do?
This
is
a
pleasure
I'm
sure
you'll
excuse
me
You
see,
Major
Strasser,
You
were
a
Czechoslovakian.
Now
I
have
never
accepted
that
privilege.
I'd
like
to
discuss
some
matters
arising
This
is
hardly
the
time
or
place.
Then
we
shall
state
Tomorrow
at
10
in
the
prefect's
office.
With
mademoiselle.
Captain,
I
am
under
your
authority.
Is
it
your
order
Let
us
say
it
is
my
request.
-
Very
well.
Mademoiselle.
A
very
clever
tactical
retreat,
major.
-
This
time
they
really
mean
to
stop
me.
We've
been
in
difficult
places
before,


I
must
find
out
what
Berger
knows.
-
Be
careful.
Monsieur
Berger,
the
ring.
-
Yes.
Champagne
cocktail,
please.
I
recognize
you
from
the
news
In
a
concentration
camp,
We
read
five
times
that
you
were
killed
As
you
see,
Thank
heaven
I
found
you,
Berger.
I'm
looking
for
a
man
by
the
name
of
Ugarte
cannot
even
help
himself.
He's
under
arrest
for
murder.
I
see.
But
we
who
are
still
free
will
do
Underground,
like
everywhere
else.
Tomorrow
night
there
is
a
meeting
If
you
will
come...
SASCHA:
Will
you
ask
the
piano
player
MAN:
-
How's
the
jewelry
business,
Berger?
Too
bad
you
weren't
here
earlier.
We
had
quite
a
bit
of
excitement,
Yes.
Excuse
me,
gentlemen.
-
My
bill.
ILSA:
Hello,
Sam.
I
never
expected
to
see
you
again.
It's
been
a
long
time.
Yes,
ma'am.
-
Some
of
the
old
songs,
Sam.

Where
is
Rick?
I
don't
know.
-
When
will
he
be
back?
He
went
home.
-
Does
he
always
leave
so
early?
Well,
he's
got
a
girl
Goes
up
there
all
the
time.
You
used
to
be
a
much
better
liar,
Sam.
Leave
him
alone,
Miss
Ilsa.
Play
it
once,
Sam.
I
don't
know
what
you
mean,
Play
it,
Sam.
Play
"As
Time
Goes
By."
I
can't
remember
it,
Miss
Ilsa.
I'll
hum
it
for
you.


Sing
it,
Sam.

Sam,
I
thought
I
told
you
never
to
play...
Well,
you
were
asking
about
Rick,
-
Hello,
Ilsa.
Oh,
you've
already
met
Rick,
This
is
Mr.
Laszlo.
-
How
do
you
do?
One
hears
a
great
deal
about
Rick
And
about
Victor
Laszlo
everywhere.
-
Won't
you
join
us
for
a
drink?
RICK:
Thanks,
I
will.
...a
precedent
is
being
broken.
Emile.
-
Interesting
caf.
I
congratulate
you.
-
What
for?
Thank
you.
I
try.
We
all
try.
You
succeed.
She
was
asking
about
you
earlier,
Rick...
...in
a

met...
How
nice.
You
remembered.
But,
of
course,
that
was

Not

I
remember

Yes.
I
put

-
Your

sir.
Another

gone.
I'll
call
you
a

We'll
come
again.

good
night
to

for
me.
There's
still
nobody
in
the

who
He
hasn't
played
it
in
a
long
time.
-
Good
night.
Night.
A
very
puzzling
fellow,
this
Rick.
I
really
can't
say,
-
Tomorrow
at
10,
at
the
prefect
office.
-
Good
night.
Boss?
-
Boss?
-
Boss,
ain't
you
going
to
bed?
Ain't
you
planning
on
going
to
bed
No.
-
You
ever
going
to
bed?
Well,
I
ain't
sleepy,
either.
Good,
then
have
a
drink.
-
Not
me,
boss.
Boss,
let's
get
out
of
here.
No,
sir.
I'm
waiting
for
a
lady.
Please,
let's
go.
She's
coming
back.
We'll
take
the
car
and
drive
all
night.
We'll
get
drunk.
We'll
go
fishing,
-
Shut
up
and
go
home,
will
you?
They
grab
Ugarte,
then
she
walks
in.
Well,
that's
the
way
it
goes.

-
Sam.
If
it's
December
1941
in
Casablanca,
What?
My
watch
stopped.
I
bet
they're
asleep
in
New
York.
I
bet
they're
asleep
all
over
America.
Of
all
the
gin
joints
in
all
the
towns
...she
walks
into
mine.
-
What's
that
you're
playing?
-
Stop
it.
You
know
what
I
want
to
hear.
You
played
it
for
her.
-
I
don't
think
I
can
remember...
Play
it.
Yes,
boss.


Who
are
you
really?
What
did
you
do,
We
said
no
questions.
Here's
looking
at
you,
kid.
A
franc
for
your
thoughts.
In
America
they'd
bring
only
a
penny.
I
guess
that's
about
all
they're
worth.
I'm
willing
to
be
overcharged.
Tell
me.
Well,
I
was
wondering...
Yes?
Why
I'm
so
lucky.
Why
I
should

Why
there
is
no
other
man
in
my
life?
That's
easy.
He's
dead.
I'm
sorry
for
asking.
I
forgot

I
have

I'll
meet
you
at
the

All
right,
at
a
quarter
to

Why
don't

That's

you
hear
me?
Come
on,
Mr.

-
Rick,
I
have
to
talk
to
you.
I
saved
my
first
drink
-
No,
Rick.
Not
tonight.
Why
did
you
have
to
come
to
I
wouldn't
have
come
Believe
me,
Rick,
it's
true.
It's
funny
about
your
voice,
"Richard,
dear,
-
We'll
get
on
a
train
and
never
stop."
I
can
understand
how
you
feel.
You

How
long
was
it

I

I

look

Maybe
one'll

about

who
had
just
come

met
a

opened
up

whole

Everything
she
knew
And
she
looked
up
to
him...
...and
worshiped
him...
...with
a
feeling
she
supposed
was
love.
Yes,
that's
very
pretty.
I
heard
a
story
once.
In
fact,
They
went
along
with
the
sound

in
the

downstairs.

you.

will
not
mince
words.
So

have
been

have

Well,
perhaps
I
shall

it
in
Casablanca.
STRASSER:
-
You
needn't
be
concerned
about
me.
Don't
be
in
such
a
hurry.
You
may
be
in
Casablanca
indefinitely.
Or
you
may
leave
for
Lisbon
tomorrow.
-
On
one
condition.
You
know
the
leader
of
the
underground

Amsterdam...
...Oslo,
Belgrade,
Athens...
-
Even
Berlin.
If
you
will
furnish
me
with

have
your
visa
in
the
morning.
And
the
honor
of
having
served
I
was
in
a
German
concentration
camp
-
That's
honor
enough
for
a
lifetime.

aspect

are

is

is

you
send

sit
down.

is
something
I
want

about

fat
hypocrite.

don't

Of
course
not.

upsets
me

no

knows
where
Practically
no
one.

I
had
those
letters,

could

have

proposition

handle
the
entire
transaction.

rid
of
the
letters,
take
all
the
risk,
And
the
carrying
charges?
Naturally
there
will
be
a
few
That's
my
proposition
I'll
tell
him
when
he
comes
in.

think
you
know
You're
in
good
company.

why
I
came
here.

You're
being
cheated.
For

of

Did
I
say
700
francs?
I'm
sorry
I
was
in
no
condition
to
receive
Doesn't
matter.
For
special
friends
of
Rick's
Your
story
had
me
a
little
confused.
I
have
some
tablecloths,
napkins...
-
Thank
you.
I'm
really
not
interested.
Why
did
you
come
back?
To
tell
me
why
Yes.
Well,
you
can
tell
me
now.
I
don't
think
I
will,
Rick.
Why
not?
After
all,
I
got
stuck
with
I
think
I'm
entitled
to
know.
Last
night
I
saw
The
Rick
I
knew
in
Paris,
But
the
one
who
looked
at
me
I'll
be
leaving
Casablanca
soon.
We
knew
very
little
about
each
other
If
we
leave
it
that
way...
...maybe
we'll
remember
Not
last
night.
Did
you
run
out
on
me
because
Hiding
from
the
police,
You
can
believe
that
if
you
want
to.
Well,
I'm
not
running
away
anymore.
Above
a
saloon,
it's
true...
...but
walk
up
a
flight...
...I'll
be
expecting
you.
All
the
same,
You'll
be
there.
No,
Rick.
No.
You
see,
Victor
Laszlo
And
was,
I
was
just
telling
Monsieur
Laszlo
that
You
see,
my
dear,
As
leader
of
all
illegal
activities
in
...I
am
influential
and
respected.
But
it
would
not
be
worth
my
life
You,
however,
are
a
different
matter.
Signor
Ferrari
thinks
it
might
just
be
-
You
mean
for
me
to
go
on
alone?
I'll
stay
here
and
keep
on
trying.
Might
as
well
be
frank,
monsieur.
It
would
take
a
miracle
to
get
you
out.
We
are
only
interested
in
two
visas.
-
Please,
Ilsa,
don't
be
hasty.
You
two
will
want
to
discuss
this.
Excuse
me.
I'll
be
at
the
bar.
No,
Ilsa.
You
must
get
to
America.
Believe
me,
But
if
the
situation
were
different...
...if
I
had
to
stay
...would
you
take
it?
Yes,
I
would.
Yes,
I
see.
When
I
had
trouble
getting
out
of
Lille,
When
I
was
sick
...and
you
were
in
danger
every
minute,
I
meant
to,
I
love
you
very
much,
Ilsa.
Your
secret
will
be
safe
with
me.
Ferrari
is
waiting
for
our
answer.
Not
more
than
50
francs.
We've
decided,
Signor
Ferrari.
For
the
present
we
will
go
on
looking
Well,
good
luck,
but
be
careful.
-
You
know
you're
being
shadowed?
I
observe
that
you,
in
one
respect,
I
am
moved
to
make
one
more
Because
it
cannot
possibly
profit
me.
Have
you
heard
about
Ugarte
Yes,
something.
Those
letters
were
not
found
on
Ugarte
-
You
know
where
they
are?
But
I'd
guess
that
Ugarte

A
difficult
customer,
that
Rick.
But
it
is
worth
a
chance.
Thank
you
very
much.
Goodbye.
Thank
you
for
your
coffee.

shall
miss
that

of
you

share
it

Put
up
a

We
will
begin
with

What
did
you
say?
-
What
I
said
is
none
of
your
business.
I
don't
like
disturbances
in
my
place.
You
see,
captain?
The
situation
is
not
as
under
control
We
try
to
cooperate
But
we
cannot
regulate
Captain,
are
you
certain
I
have
no
conviction,

blow
with

wind...
...and

wind
And
if
it
should
change?
Surely

are
concerned
We
know
that

Waiting
for

chance.
A
leader?
Like
Laszlo?
Mm-hm.
I
have
been
thinking.
It's
too
dangerous
to
let
him
go,
I
see
what
you
mean.

Thank
you,
Carl.
Thank
you,
Carl.
Sit
down.
Have
a
brandy
with
us.
To
celebrate
our
leaving
Thank
you
very
much.
I
thought
you
would
ask
me,
...and
a
third
glass.
At
last
the
day's
came!
Frau
Leuchtag
and
I
So
we
should
feel
at
home
A
very
nice
idea.
-
To
America.
To
America.

What
watch?
-
Ten
watch.
You
will
get
along
beautifully
in
America.
How
is
lady
luck
treating
you?
Oh,
too
bad.
You'll
find
him
over
there.
-
Monsieur
Rick?
-
Could
I
speak
to
you,
please?
-
I
came
with
Captain
Renault.
My
husband
is
with
me
too.
He
is?
Captain
Renaults
getting
Have
a
drink?
-
No,
of
course
not.
You
mind
if
I
do?
Monsieur
Rick,
Like
any
other
man,
only
more
so.
No,
I
mean...
...is
he
trustworthy?
Just
a
minute.
He
did.
Captain
Renault
did.
I
thought
so.
Where's
your
husband?
At
the
roulette
table,
Oh,
of
course
he's
losing.
-
How
long
have
you
been
married?
We
come
from
Bulgaria.
Things
are
very
bad
there.
The
devil
has
the
people
So
Jan
and
I,
we...
We
do
not
want
our
children
-
So
you
decided
to
go
to
America.
But
we
haven't
much
money...
...and
traveling
is
so
expensive
It
was
much
more
than
we
thought
And
then
Captain
Renault
sees
us,
Yes,
I'll
bet.
He
tells
me
he
can
give
us
an
exit
visa.
But
we
have
no
money.
-
Does
he
know
that?
-
And
he's
still
willing
to
give
you
a
visa?
-
And
you
want
to
know..?
He
always
has.
Oh...
Monsieur...
...you
are
a
man.
If
someone
loved
you
very
much...
...so
that
your
happiness
was
the
only
...and
she
did
a
bad
thing
...could
you
forgive
her?
And
he
never
knew,
and
the
girl
kept
...that
would
be
all
right,
-
You
want
my
advice?
Go
back
to
Bulgaria.
Oh,
but
if
you
knew
what
it
means
to
us
Oh,
but
if
Jan
should
find
out.
In
many
ways
Yes,
well,
everybody
in
Casablanca
-
Yours
may
work
out.
You'll
excuse
me.
-
Good
evening.
You
see?
Here
we
are
again.
I
take
that
I
suppose
he
means
to
you
He
does.
Could
we
And
as
far
away
The
geography
may
be
-
Paul,
table
30.
Right
this
way,
if
you
please.
I'll
have
Sam
play
"As
Time
Goes
By."
Thank
you.

-
Two
cognacs,
please.

Do
you
wish
to
place
another
bet,
sir?
No.
No,
I
guess
not.
Have
you
tried
22
tonight?
I
said
22.

Leave
it
there.
Cash
it
in
and
don't
come
back.
Are
you
sure
this
place
is
honest?
Honest?
As
honest
as
the
day
is
long.
How
are
we
doing
tonight?
A
couple
of
thousand
less
Monsieur
Rick...
I...
Oh...
He's
just
a
lucky
guy.
Monsieur
Rick,
-
No,
thanks,
Carl.
Captain
Renault,
may
l..?
Not
here.
We'll
do
everything
businesslike.
-
We'll
be
there
at
6.
I'm
very
happy
for
both
of
you.
Still,
it's
very
strange
that
you
won.
Well,
maybe
not
so
strange.
-
I'll
see
you
in
the
morning.
No!

Boss,
you've
done
a
beautiful
thing.
Go
away,
you
crazy
Russian.
As
I
suspected.
Yeah?
Why?
Why
do
you
interfere
Put
it
down
as
a
gesture
to
love.
Well,
I'll
forgive
you
this
time.
But
I'll
be
in
tomorrow
night
And
it'll
make
me
very
happy
Mm-hm.
Mr.
Blaine,
-
Go
ahead.
It's
rather
confidential,
-
In
my
office.
You
must
know
it's
very
important
It's
my
privilege
to
be
one
of
the
leaders
You
know
what
I've
been
doing.
You
know
what
it
means
to
the
work,
...that
I
reach
America
I'm
not
interested
in
politics.
The
problems
of
the
world
I'm
a
saloonkeeper.
My
friends
in
the
underground
tell
me
You
ran
guns
to
Ethiopia.
You
fought
against
What
of
it?
Isn't
it
strange
you're
always
Yes,
I
found
that
But
then
I
never
was
Are
you
enough
of
a
businessman
to
-
I
appreciate
it,
but
I
don't
accept
it.
My
friend,
you
could
make
it
My
answer
would
still
be
the
same.
There
must
be
some
reason
There
is.
I
suggest
that
you
ask
your
wife.
-
I
beg
your
pardon?
-
My
wife?

Play
"La
Marseillaise."

Vive
la
France!
See
what
I
mean?
If
Laszlo's
presence
in
...what
more
will
his
presence
I
advise
that
this
place
-
But
everybody's
having
a
good
time.
The
place
is
to
be
closed.
-
But
I
have
no
excuse
to
close
it.

Everybody
is
to
leave
immediately.
This
caf
is
closed
until
further
notice.
Clear
the
room
at
once.
How
can
you
close
me
up?
I'm
shocked,
shocked
to
find
that
-
Your
winnings,
sir.
Everybody
out
at
once.
After
this
disturbance
it
is
not
safe
This
morning
you
implied
it
wasn't
safe
That
is
also
true,
except
for
one
-
Occupied
France?
Of
what
value
is
that?
You
may
recall
what
German
guarantees
-
There
are
two
other
alternatives
for
him.
The
French
authorities
...to
put
him
The
other
alternative?
My
dear,
...that
in
Casablanca
Good
night,
mademoiselle.
-
What
happened
with
Rick?
Our
faithful
friend
is
still
there.
Please
don't
go
I
must.
Besides,
it
isn't
often
that
a
man
gets
Don't
joke.
After
Major
Strasser's
Tell
you
the
truth,
Shall
I
remain
here
Or
shall
I
carry
on
the
best
I
can?
Whatever
I'd
say,
Victor,
why
don't
you
tell
me
-
Apparently
he
has
the
letters.
But
no
intention
of
selling
them.
You'd
think
if
sentiment
Did
he
give
any
reason?
-
He
suggested
I
ask
you.
Yes,
he
said,
"Ask
your
wife."
I
don't
know
why
he
said
that.
Well,
our
friend
outside
will
think
I'll
be
going
in
a
few
minutes.
-
Ilsa,
I...
When
I
was
in
the
concentration
camp...
...were
you
lonely
in
Paris?
Yes,
Victor,
I
was.
I
know
how
it
is
to
be
lonely.
Is
there
anything
you
wish
to
tell
me?
No,
Victor,
there
isn't.
I
love
you
very
much,
my
dear.
Yes.
Yes,
I
know.
Victor,
whatever
I
do,
You
don't
even
have
to
say
it.
I'll
believe.
Good
night,
dear.
Good
night.
-
Victor.
Be
careful.
Of
course
I'll
be
careful.
Well,
you
are
in
How
long
can
I
afford
to
stay
closed?
Two
weeks,
maybe
three.
Maybe
I
won't
have
to.
In
the
meantime,
Thank
you,
Herr
Rick.
Sascha
will
be
happy
to
hear
it.
-
You
finish
locking
up,
will
you,
Carl?
-
Then
I
am
going
to
the
meeting...
I
won't.
Good
night.
Good
night,
Mr.
Rick.
-
How
did
you
get
in?
I
told
you
this
morning
you'd
come
Well,
won't
you
sit
down?
-
Richard,
I
had
to
see
you.
Your
visit
isn't
connected
Seems
as
long
as
I
have
those
letters
Ask
any
price
you
want,
I
went
all
through
that
I
know
how
you
feel
about
me...
...but
put
your
feelings
aside
I
have
to
hear
again
...what
an
important
cause
It
was
your
cause
too.
In
your
own
way,
you
were
fighting
I'm
not
fighting
for
anything
I'm
the
only
cause
I'm
interested
in.
Richard.
We
loved
each
other
once.
If
those
I
wouldn't
bring
up
Paris
if
I
were
you.
Listen
to
me.
If
you
knew
what
really
I
wouldn't
believe
you
You'd
say
anything
now
You
want
to
feel
sorry
for
yourself,
With
so
much
at
stake
One
woman
has
hurt
you...
...and
you
take
your
revenge
You're
a
coward
and
a
weakling.
No.
Oh,
Richard.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry,
but
you
are
our
last
hope.
If
you
don't
help
us,
What
of
it?
I'm
going
to
die
in
Casablanca.
Now,
if
you'll...
All
right.
I
tried
to
reason
with
you.
I
tried
everything.
-
Get
them
for
me.
Put
them
on
the
table.
No.
For
the
last
time,
If
Laszlo
and
the
cause
mean
so
much
All
right,
Go
ahead
and
shoot.
Richard...
...I
tried
to
stay
away.
I
thought
I
would
never
see
you
again.
That
you
were
out
of
my
life.
The
day
you
left
Paris...
...if
you
knew
what
I
went
through.
If
you
knew
how
much
I
loved
you.
How
much
I
still
love
you.
And
then?
It
wasn't
long
after
we
were
married
They
needed
him
in
Prague,
but
there
Just
a
two-line
item
in
the
paper:
"Victor
Laszlo
apprehended.
I
was
frantic.
Then
it
came.
He
was
dead.
I
was
lonely.
Then
I
met
you.
Why
weren't
you
honest
with
me?
It
wasn't
my
secret,
Richard.
Not
even
our
closest
friends
That
was
his
way
of
protecting
me.
If
the
Gestapo
found
out
I
was
his
wife
...and
for
those
working
with
us.
And
when
did
you
first
find
out
Just
before
you
and
I
A
friend
came
and
told
me
They
were
hiding
him
in
a
freight
car
He
was
sick.
He
needed
me.
I
wanted
to
tell
you,
I
knew
you
wouldn't
have
left
Paris,
Well...
...well,
you
know
the
rest.
Well,
it's
still
a
story
without
an
ending.
What
about
now?
Now?
I
don't
know.
I
know
that
I'll
never
have
the
strength
And
Laszlo?
You'll
help
him
now,
Richard,
won't
you?
Then
he'll
have
his
work.
All
except
one.
He
won't
have
you.
I
can't
fight
it
anymore.
I
ran
away
from
you
once.
Oh,
I
don't
know
You
have
to
think
for
both
of
us.
For
all
of
us.
All
right.
I
will.
Here's
looking
at
you,
kid.
I
wish
I
didn't
love
you
so
much.
-
I
think
we
lost
them.
I'm
afraid
they
caught
Come
inside.
Come,
Mr.
Laszlo,
LASZLO:
RICK:
The
police
break
up
our
meeting,
We
escaped
at
the
last
moment.
-
Come
up
here
a
minute.
Turn
out
the
light
in
the
rear
entrance.
-
But
Sascha
always
puts
out
that
light.
Yes,
I
come.
I
will
do
it.
-
I
want
you
to
take
Miss
Lund
home.
It's
nothing,
just
a
little
cut.
This
might
come
in
handy.
Thank
you.
-
Had
a
close
one,
eh?
Don't
you
sometimes
wonder
I
mean,
what
you're
fighting
for.
We
might
as
well
question
If
we
stop
breathing,
we'll
die.
If
we
stop
fighting
our
enemies,
What
of
it?
You
know
how
you
sound,
Like
a
man
...of
something
Each
of
us
has
a
destiny.
-
I
get
the
point.
I
wonder
if
you
know
that
you're
trying
...and
that
you'll
never
succeed.
You
seem
to
know
all
about
my
destiny.
I
know
a
good
deal
more
I
know
that
you're
in
love
It's
perhaps
a
strange
circumstance...
...that
we
both
should
be
in
love
The
first
evening
I
came
into
this
caf...
...I
knew
there
was
something
Since
no
one
is
to
blame...
...I
demand
no
explanation.
I
ask
only
one
thing.
All
right.
But
I
want
my
wife
to
be
safe.
I
ask
you
as
a
favor...
...to
use
the
letters
You
love
her
that
much?
Apparently
you
think
of
me
only
Well,
I
am
also
a
human
being.
Yes,
I
love
her
that
much.

-
Monsieur
Laszlo?
You'll
come
with
us.
On
what
charge?
Captain
Renault
will
discuss
that
It
seems
that
destiny
has
taken
a
hand.
You
haven't
any
proof,
and
you
know
it.
All
you
can
do
is
fine
him
You
might
as
well
let
him
go
now.
I'd
advise
you
not
to
be
too
interested
If
you
were
to
help
him
escape...
What
makes
you
think
Because,
one,
Two,
you've
got
the
letters
of
transit.
And
you
might
do
it
simply
As
a
matter
of
fact,
They're
all
excellent
reasons.
Don't
count
too
much
on
my
friendship.
In
this
matter
I'm
powerless.
You're
not
very
subtle,
Yes,
I
have
the
letters.
But
I
intend
using
them
myself.
I'm
leaving
Casablanca
And
I'm
taking
a
friend
with
me.
-
What
friend?
That
ought
to
put
your
mind
to
rest
The
last
man
I
want
to
see
in
America.
You
didn't
come
here
to
tell
me
this.
You
can
fill
in
your
name
and
hers
Why
are
you
still
interested
I'm
not.
But
I
am
interested
We
have
a
legal
right
to
go,
...but
people
have
been
held
...in
spite
of
their
legal
rights.
What
makes
you
think
Ilsa
is
Laszlo's
wife.
She
probably
knows
things
Louis,
I'll
make
a
deal
with
you.
Instead
of
this
petty
charge
against
him,
...something
that
would
chuck
him
-
Be
quite
a
feather
in
your
cap,
right?
Germany...
Then
release
him.
You
be
at
my
place
a
half-hour
I'll
have
Laszlo
come
there
...and
that'll
give
you
grounds
You
get
him,
and
we
get
away.
To
the
Germans,
There's
still
something
about
this
Miss
Lund,
she
is
very
beautiful,
yes...
...but
you
were
never
interested
-
She
isn't
just
any
woman.
How
do
I
know
you'll
keep
I'll
make
the
arrangements
now
I'm
gonna
miss
you.
You're
the
only
one
in
Casablanca
Oh,
thanks.
Go
ahead,
Ricky.
Call
off
your
watchdogs
I
don't
want
them
around
this
afternoon.
I'm
taking
no
chances,
Louis,
FERRARI:
Should
we
draw
up
papers,
Certainly
not
good
enough.
To
get
out
of
Casablanca
and
My
agreement
with
Sam
is
that
he
gets
I
happen
to
know
he
gets
10
percent.
Abdul,
Carl
and
Sascha,
Of
course.
Well,
so
long.
Don't
forget
you
owe
Rick's
I
shall
remember
to
pay
it
to
myself.


RICK:
I
was
informed
when
Laszlo
-
I
asked
you
to
tie
up
your
watchdogs.
This
place
will
never
be
I
know
what
you
mean.
But
I've
spoken
-
Is
everything
ready?
When
we
searched
the
place,
Sam's
piano.
Serves
me
right
for
not
being
musical.
Here
they
are.
You
better
wait
in
my
office.
Here.
Victor
thinks
I'm
leaving
with
him.
Not
yet.
But
you
were
able
to
Everything
is
quite
all
right.
We'll
tell
him
at
the
airport.
Please
trust
me.
Yes,
I
will.
-
I
don't
know
how
to
thank
you.
LASZLO:
I
brought
the
money.
-
But
we
made
a
deal.
-
You
won't
have
any
trouble
in
Lisbon?
Good.
I've
got
the
letters
here,
All
you
have
to
do
is
fill
RENAULT:
Victor
Laszlo,
you're
under
arrest.
The
charge
of
accessory
to
the
murder...
...of
the
couriers
You're
surprised
about
my
friend
Ricky?
Love,
it
seems,
Not
so
fast,
Louis.
Nobody
is
going
-
Have
you
lost
your
mind?
-
Put
that
gun
down.
...but
I
will
if
you
take
one
more
step.
Under
the
circumstances,
-
Keep
your
hands
on
the
table.
I
do.
We've
got
time
Call
off
your
watchdogs,
you
said.
Just
the
same,
call
the
airport
And
remember,
That
is
my
least
vulnerable
spot.
-
Hello?
Is
that
the
airport?
This
is
Captain
Renault
speaking.
There'll
be
two
letters
of
transit
There's
to
be
no
trouble
about
them.
Good.
Hello?
Hello?

My
car,
quickly!

This
is
Major
Strasser.
Have
a
squad
of
police
meet
me
At
once,
do
you
hear?
MAN:
Lisbon
plane
taking
off
in
10
minutes,
Visibility,
11/2
miles.
Light
ground
fog.
Ceiling
unlimited.
Thank
you.
Have
your
man
go
with
Laszlo
Certainly,
Rick,
anything
you
say.
Find
Laszlo's
luggage.
Yes,
sir.
This
way,
please.
If
you
don't
mind,
fill
in
the
names.
You
think
of
everything,
don't
you?
And
the
names
are
-
But
why
my
name,
Richard?
I
don't
understand.
I'm
staying
with
him
No.
What
has
happened?
Last
night
we
said
a
great
many
things.
You
said
I
was
to
do
the
thinking
for
us.
I've
done
a
lot
of
it
since
then.
You're
getting
on
that
plane
-
Richard,
no...
Any
idea
what
you'd
have
Chances
are
we'd
both
wind
up
I'm
afraid
Major
Strasser
would
insist.
-
You're
saying
this
only
to
make
me
go.
Inside
of
us
we
both
know
You're
part
of
his
work,
If
that
plane
leaves
Maybe
not
today,
maybe
not
tomorrow,
But
what
about
us?
We'll
always
have
Paris.
We
didn't
have...
We'd
lost
it
We
got
it
back
last
night.
-
When
I
said
I
would
never
leave
you.
But
I've
got
a
job
to
do
too.
Where
I'm
going,
you
can't
follow.
What
I've
got
to
do
Ilsa,
I'm
no
good
at
being
noble.
But
it
doesn't
take
much
to
see
...don't
amount
to
a
hill
of
beans
Someday
you'll
understand
that.
Now,
now.
Here's
looking
at
you,
kid.

-
Everything
is
in
order.
There's
something
you
should
know.
I
don't
ask
you
to
explain
anything.
I'm
going
to
anyway.
-
You
said
you
knew
about
Ilsa
and
me.
You
didn't
know
she
was
at
my
place
She
came
there
for
the
letters
of
transit.
Yes.
She
tried
everything
to
get
them.
She
did
her
best
to
convince
me
But
that
was
all
over
long
ago.
For
your
sake,
she
pretended
it
wasn't,
I
understand.
-
Here
it
is.
I
appreciate
it.
Welcome
back
to
the
fight.
This
time
I
know
our
side
will
win.
Are
you
ready,
Ilsa?
Yes,
I'm
ready.
Goodbye,
Rick.
God
bless
you.
You
better
hurry.
I
was
right.
Stay
where
you
are.
What
you
just
did
for
Laszlo.
That
fairy
tale
you
invented
I
know
a
little
about
women,
my
friend.
But
she
knew
you
were
lying.
Anyway,
thanks
for
helping
me
out.
I
suppose
you
know
this
isn't
Especially
for
you.
-
I'll
have
to
arrest
you,
of
course.
What
was
the
meaning
Victor
Laszlo
is
on
that
plane.
Why
do
you
stand
here?
Ask
Monsieur
Rick.
-
Get
away
from
that
phone.
I
was
willing
to
shoot
Captain
Renault,
-
Hello!
-
Get
me
the
radio
tower.
Major
Strasser
has
been
shot.
Round
up
the
usual
suspects.

Well,
Rick,
...but
you've
become
a
patriot.
RICK:
Maybe,
but
it
seemed
I
think
perhaps
you're
right.
It
might
be
a
good
idea
for
you
to
There's
a
Free
French
garrison
-
I
could
be
induced
to
arrange
a
passage.
I
could
use
a
trip.
But
it
doesn't
change
our
bet.
That
10,000
francs
RICK:
"Our"
expenses?
RICK:
Louis,
I
think
this
is
the
beginning
