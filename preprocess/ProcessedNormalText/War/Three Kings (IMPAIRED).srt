he's

Iran.
What'd
they
train
you
in?
Weapons,
sabotage...
...interrogation.
Great.
It
was
a
total
waste
for
your
Army
I
heard
about
a
lot
of
bad
shit
Yeah,
bad
shit
happened.
Who's
got
the
sick
country?
Maybe
Saddam
is
very
crazy.
And

crazy
Too
much
bombing
is
crazy,

:
A

Can't

the
world
crazy.
For
what?
Your

No,
for

Stabilize

built
into
It
looks
like
a
castle.
There's
a
road
It's
full
of
Saddam's
Republican
Guard.
There's
too
many.
-
But
there's
one
thing
they're
afraid
of.
Saddam.
Then
that's
what
we
use.
Right.
That's
what
we'll
use.
You
stay
with
me.
You
stay
with
me.
Wait,
hold
on
a
minute.
I
wanna
You're
scared,
right?
Maybe.
The
way
this
works
is,
you
do
...and
you
get
the
courage
after
That's
a
dumb-ass
way
to
work.
I
know.
That's
the
way
it
works.








You'll
take
away
the
biggest
part
of
me
No,
baby,
please
don't
go

You'll
take
away
the
very
