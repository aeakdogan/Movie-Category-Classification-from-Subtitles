Hello.
It

there

Come

Hello.
You

Albert,
I
can't

Why
don't
you
leave

Go

Come
in.
I
knew
you'd
come.
You
wouldn't

I've
come
to
say
goodbye
to
the

Of

you
must
go.
I

I
couldn't

Please,
you

That's
true.
It's
very
important
that
you
came.
Did
he
ever
doubt
that?
Lately,
he
often
thought
I
always
said
you'd
come
I
think
he
liked
it
that
you
I
also
think
it's
best.
And,
you
know...
...it
may
sound
strange...
...but
I'm
really
happy
here.
You
came.
It's
good.
Let's
sit
down.
I
had

plans
Nobody
understood
me.
The
opportunities
we
had.
Too
late.
I
can
only

proud
for

...and
for
cleansing
the

I
don't
find
it
hard
to
continue.
...and
then
eternal
peace.
But
please
spare
the
people,
If
my
people
cannot
endure
...I
won't
shed
a
tear.
They
get
what
they
deserve.
They

fate
For

to
tell
you
this...
...for

ignored
your

you.
This

So
you're
leaving.
Good.
Goodbye.
I
wish
you
all

Eat
