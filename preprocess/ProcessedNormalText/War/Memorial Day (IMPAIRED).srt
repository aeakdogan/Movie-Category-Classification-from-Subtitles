So,
I
still
have
a

I'm

Boring?

Jamie
my

you
just
don't
know
Well,
you
can
start
by
looking
45

of

starting
now.
Justin,
you're
outside
my
jurisdiction.
And
no
shouting.
The

Yes,
Opa.
I'm
too
old
for

I

either.
Cheapskate.
Would
you
bring
me
some
lemonade?
Hm.
Are
we
going
in
the
barn?
Okay,
Justin,
here's
the
deal.
The
goal
is
not
to
get
found,
right?
But
what
if
we
hide
in
the
same
place?
Ruthy
finds
both
of
us.
Exactly.
See?
You're
smart.
So
I
know
you
can
think
of
an
even
better

RUTH:
Ready
or
not,
here
I
come!


You're
it!

No,
Kylie.
No.
Trust
me,
you'll
only
make
him
angry.
Now
put
that
back.
Go
on.
Put
it
back.
Do
what
Oma
says...
Come
on,
Kyle,
put
it
back.

That
doesn't
belong
to
you.
Do
as
I
say
now,
Kylie.
Are
you
deaf?
I
said,
"No
running!"
What
is
the
reason
It's
Memorial
Day.
You're
damn
straight
it
is.
What
am
I
supposed
to
remember?
What's
happening,
Oma?

One.
You
pick
one,
Five.
Two.
Four.
Three.
Deal.
TRIPP:
You
were
a
bold
little
bastard,
Well,
that's
why
he
respects
me,
ma'am.
So,
he's
still
alive?
Probably
sitting
on
the
rocking
chair
and
listening
for
the
meadowlark...
What
did
you
pick
first?
With
all
due
respect,
Lieutenant
Tripp,
Is
this
a
Luger?
Walther
P38.
It's
a
good
one,
Kylie.
What
do
you
say
we
save
this
one
I'll
make
you
another
deal.
I'll
talk
to
you
like
a

And
promise
me,
I'll
always
be

why?
Yeah.

All
right,

Justin,
your

back
Is

going
to

okay?
He's
going
to
be
just
fine.
Now,
Is
Opa
sad?
Oh,
Ruthy.
Do
you
remember
when
you
skinned
your
knee
She
wasn't
wearing
kneepads.
-
No
fair.
And
we
put
a
bandage
on
it,
right?
And
then
when
it
was
all
better,
But
that
hurt
almost
as
much
as
the
owy.
Does
Opa
have
any
owy?
I
don't
see
it.
How
old
were
you
when
your

No.
What
then?
His

It
was
like
there
was
something...
melting
away.
His
burdens?
His
protection.
Well?
Well,
what?
What
the
heck
you
waiting
for?
What

It's

There's
nothing

NO.
Just

Hey,
Bozo,
can
you
translate

Stay
focused,

Can
I

a

Ibuprofen,

Figured
that
out
on
your
own,
huh?
I
used
to
get
them,
too.
What
stopped
it?

Nice

I'll

up.
One

He
got
his
citizenship
papers
last
Tuesday.
I
assumed
you
knew,
Sergeant.
At
least
he
died
an
American.



You
need
to
drop
your
pack
You
know
that,
right?
Right.
Be
a
good
leader,
That's
not
what
I
meant
My
orders
were
clear,
ma'am.
One
bad
decision
and
somebody
dies.
That's
reality.
Sometimes
the
worst
decision
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
You
and
Bud
are
good
at
stowing
things.
I
am

So
when

How
do
you
deal
with

Not
very
well.
His

is

He's

Nope,

But,
you're
not
having
any
fun.

Oh,
I've
been
far
worse
than
this,
Kylie.
I
think
I
can
handle
telling
a
few
stories.
Besides,
is
the
enemy
still
spying
on
us?
Go
ahead.
Okay.
Was
he
your
friend?
Yup.
Jack
O'Hara.
This
was
taken
at
Camp
Mackall,
You
can
tell
neither
Let's
just
say
this
one
didn't
count.
Go
ahead,
pick
another
one.
Tell
me
about
him.
Grab
that

there,
No,
he
was

What

How'd

Yep.

You

to

Victor

There
were
two

day
my

tells
me
to

So,
I
sneak
into
the

church,
and
the
minute
I
say,
"Bless
me,
the
priest,

can't

see
me,
"You
don't
belong
to

I
mean,
I'm
not
gonna

Keep
walking.

I
should
have
left
the
church
right
But
I
didn't.
And
