The
subtitle
is
based
on
a
spanish
translation
of
this
film
I
have
machine
translated
it
first,
and
then
added
some
sense
to
the
result
by
my
best
knowledge.
As
I
speak
neither
japanese
nor
spanish
,
this
translation
might
be
a
bit
off
sometimes,
so
please
excuse
the
errors
you
might
notice.
How
did
our
soldiers
dig
those
tunnels?
Must
have
been
working
shifts
all
the
time...
I
found
something!
Hanako.
We
soldiers
dig,
we
dig
all
day.
this
it
is
-
the
hole
in
which
we
will
fight
and
in
which
we
will
die!
Hanako,
I
am
digging
my
own
tomb.
Now
I'm
doing
as
I'm
expected
I
am
determined
to
serve
my
country
and
to
die
for
it.
I'm
going
through
all
the
things
I
have
left
in
my
house
Sadly,
I
did
not
fix
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
before
going
I
had
the
intention,
but
I
had
to
go
before
being
able
to
do
it,
and
it
has
worried
me
Make
sure
that
Taro
fixes
it
soon.
Damn
Island!
Shall
the
yankees
have
it!
Nothing
grows
here,
it's
too
warm,
too
many
insects
and
no
water
to
drink
This
island
is
sacred
japanese
soil!
There
isn't
any
soil
on
this
island!
Saigo!
We
should
give
a
part
of
it
to
the
Americans
In
exchange
for
something
else
Saigo!
What
did
you
say,
soldier?
That
if
we
overcome
the
Americans
we
will
be
able
to
go
home
soon!
That
is
what
he
said?
Yes
Sir!
I
am
Kuribayashi
Welcome
General!
What
time
is
it?
Unfortunately
They
left
me
kissed
the
work
reason
why
him
passage
to
Yakamoto
I
understand.
Are
you
feeling
alright?
You
look
sort
of
pale-
Sir,
it
is
not
nothing.
I
can't
cope
with
the
water
here
very
well.
We
will
take
care
of
that.
But
first
I
want
to
inspect
the
island.
You
want
a
vehicle,
Sir?
We
will
be
walking.
it
is
good
for
the
health.
Perhaps
that
is
what
you
need,
Ohsugi!
That
is
Mount
Suribachi.
Unpatriotic,
useless
farmers!
Stop!
Get
up!
These
soldiers
They
have
made
unpatriotic
comments!
And
You
have
such
excess
of
soldiers,
that
you
can
afford
the
luxury
to
incapacitate
those
two?
No,
Sir!
So
now
stop
beating
them,
better
reduce
their
food
ration!
A
good
Captain
uses
the
brain,
not
only
the
whip
What
is
all
that?
We
expect
the
Americans
to
disembark
here,
Sir!
Stop
that
immediately!
Make
sure
that
the
men
are
rested.
They
seem
to
come
from
another
planet.
Stop
digging!
My
stomach
hurt
from
this!
A
toast
to
General
Kuribayashi!
A
good
commander.
This
is
almost
better
than
Sake...
Perhaps
for
that
reason
he
does
not
want
trenches.
Perhaps
he
likes
the
Americans!
It's
useless
to
study
the
Americans!
Now
he
knows
their
weaknesses
and
how
to
overcome
them
Somebody
of
the
204th
told
me
That
another
General
was
going
to
assume
the
commando
of
this
island
.....
But
he
didn't
want
the
job.
So
Prime
minister
Tojo
granted
it
to
Kuribayashi
Bullshit.
You
can
hear
many
things.
But
you
shouldn't
listen
to
the
rumors.
In
short,
nobody
from
the
204th
can
confirm
nothing.
The
204th
is
part
of
the
Imperial
Navy.
This
Kuribayashi,
he
is
an
excellent
General!
As
you
can
see,
we
aren't
digging
any
damned
trenches
in
the
sand
any
more!
I
didn't
expect
it
to
be
so
hot
This
island
is
bigger
than
I
thought
Well...
I'm
a
bit
tired.
Ito
reporting
itself!
What's
with
our
air
force?
We
lost
66
airplanes
during
the
hard
days
when
supporting
Saipan.
So
we
will
have
to
depend
on
the
support
of
the
fleet.
Is
that
the
plan
of
defense?
Yes
Sir
And
the
army
troops.
Where
are
their
positions?
We
don't
know
it
exactly,
Sir.
They
are
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Adachi.
We
don't
have
command
over
the
army
troops?
According
to
the
military
rules:not
until
the
enemy
disembarkation.
This
is
a
war
in
the
Sea,
do
you
know
that?
This
is
not
going
to
work!
They
concentrated
everything
in
beaches
Move
the
trucks!
So,
get
them
moving
again!
Coordinate
immediately
with
the
army
troops!
The
construction
of
Bunkers
begins
in
the
Zuribache.
This
has
top
priority.
We
are
going
to
fight
them
when
they
stop!
It's
very
dark
outside
already,
Sir
He
is
going
to
make
everybody
crazy.
Commanders
always
do
it
Another
letter?
You
do
not
know
that
the
mail
only
leaves
when
there
is
a
boat?
I
have
much
family
So
why
do
you
send
those
letters
only
to
your
wife?
Put!
I'll
do
you
the
favor,
the
other
one
didn't
arrive!
What
are
you
doing?
Let's
see
what
you
are
doing
wrong...
"Dear
Hanako,
we
soldiers
dig,
we
dig
all
day.."
No,
nothing
like
this
is
ever
happening
here,
you
can't
write
that.
Give
it
back
immediately!
Calm
down
already!
You
are
going
to
be
thankful
to
me
later.
Next
one!
Shoot!
Are
you
blind,
soldier?
The
target
is
over
ther!
My
son
of
6
years
shoots
better
than
you
Return
to
shooting!
You
are
a
shame!
You
want
to
be
an
imperial
soldier?
You
think
that
this
is
a
game?
I
have
work
for
you,
go
clean
the
boots
of
the
entire
regiment!
Step
back!
They
need
to
learn
to
clean
their
rifles,
not
their
boots
What
are
those
tanks
doing
here?
Most
of
them
need
spare
parts.
Father,
here
in
America
there
is
a
flood
of
automobiles.
I
have
to
take
care
to
cross
the
street.
There
are
cars
everywhere.
Father,
are
they
caring
well
for
you
and
does
mother
obey?
I
miss
you
very
much.
We
will
move
the
tanks
into
position
as
artillery
cannons.
Yes
Sir,
will
be
made
immediately.
Hanako,
we
have
a
celebrity
here,
baron
Nishi,
olympic
gold
in
horse
jump.
He
will
be
in
charge
of
the
2nd
tank
regiment.
That
he
came
here
from
Tokyo,
is
quite
pleasant.
He
is
said
to
be
a
real
favorite
with
the
ladies
But
on
this
island
there
are
no
women
left
that
he
can
seduce
Lieutenant
Colonel
Nishi,
you
brought
your
horse
with
you
by
the
sight
of
it.
Yes,
from
Shichi
Jima.
I
was
in
the
cavalry.
It
is
an
honor
for
me
to
be
under
your
command,
as
you
understand
as
much
of
horses
as
I
do.
When
we
rode
with
our
horses
in
the
battlefield
Those
were
true
times!
Not
like
with
these
machines.
I
can
request
another
horse
for
you!
Let's
ride
together,
Sir.
Thanks
no,
not
anymore.
Please,
tell
me
about
the
famous
horse,
with
which
you
won
the
Olympic
Games
My
stallion
Uranus.
Very
beautiful,
an
excellent
horse!
I
acquired
it
in
Italy
They
were
happy
to
get
rid
of
it,
as
it
was
a
very
wild
horse.
Nobody
could
mount
that
beast
I
said
then
that
I
and
a
horse
so
obstinate,
we
would
make
a
good
pair.
Have
supper
with
me
tonight,
let's
drink
something
It
will
be
an
honor
for
me
How
did
you
get
that
Johnny
Walker
here?
Excuse
me,
this
is
everything
we
have
available
It's
alright,
as
long
as
we
have
this!
And
this
empty
plate?
I
passed
the
order
that
all
the
officers
had
to
eat
the
same
rations
as
the
troops.
I
know
Sir,
but
the
rule
is
to
serve
3
plates
So
we
have
to
empty
those
three
plates?
Thank
you.
It
is
lamentable
that
most
of
the
fleet
have
been
destroyed
We
even
have
some
battleships.
But
we
have
very
few
possibilities
left
for
attack
from
the
air
or
the
sea
What
are
you
talking
about,
Nishi?
Didn't
you
hear
about
the
battle
in
the
Marianas?
The
Aircraft
carrier
and
the
planes
of
the
Admiral
Ozawa
were
annihilated
The
Headquarters
They
are
deceiving
the
japanese
public,
and
lie
to
us
as
well!
General,
you
want
to
hear
my
sincere
opinion?
The
best
thing
than
we
could
do
is
to
send
this
island
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea,
with
all
of
us
on
it.
And
you
even
came
here
knowing
all
this?
Well,
I
thought
that
we
would
have
to
occupy
all
the
tanks
that
we
have.
It
must
be
here
The
enemy
is
going
to
disembark
right
here!
Run,
soldier!
As
if
the
enemy
was
disembarking!
Run!
Run
.....
towards
there,
what
decision
would
you
take?
Continue
running
.....
in
both
directions
keep
running!
don't
stop!
Listen
I
believe
that
the
commander
became
crazy.
His
pistol
He
must
have
taken
it
from
a
dead
American
Perhaps!
They
rest
is
over!
To
work!
Are
you
feeling
alright,
Kashiwara?
You
look
very
pale...
I'm
alright,
it's
just
the
damn
water.
I
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
We
will
change
our
strategy.
We
will
make
caves
and
tunnels
in
the
zones
of
Matayama
and
Igashigushi.
We
will
create
underground
fortifications
and
we
will
fight
until
the
end.
And
the
defenses
of
the
beach
Sir?
But
those
trenches
are
our
first
line
of
defense!
Without
trenches
in
the
beach,
how
do
you
hope
that
we
can
resist
the
invasion?
Do
you
know
the
amount
of
cars
produced
in
the
USA
in
only
a
year?
We
cannot
underestimate
their
technological
advances.
Sooner
or
later,
they
will
cross
those
beaches.
If
we
waste
our
soldiers
there,
we
are
going
to
lose.
It
is
inevitable
that
men
will
die,
I've
never
before
heard
of
fortifying
the
inner
Island!
This
is
a
waste
of
time,
time
we
don't
use
to
prepare
us!
We
will
have
to
lure
the
enemy
and
crush
them
in
a
combined
attack
by
air
and
sea
I
agree,
that
makes
sense!
But
do
you
know
about
the
navy?
The
aircraft
carrier
fleet
was
destroyed.
This
island
is
isolated
now
I
received
your
new
order
from
the
Headquarters
this
morning
Our
fighter
planes
will
have
to
return
to
the
motherland
in
order
to
defend
the
greater
islands.
It
is
a
barbarism!
how
are
we
going
to
fight?
We
do
not
have
time
to
discuss.
We
needed
to
return
now.
Dear
mother.
Today
they
assigned
me
to
a
new
troops
I
can't
say
anything
about
the
new
place
yet.
I
miss
you,
take
care.
Look
at
this
photo.
It
is
a
beautiful
castle.
You
know
for
who
they
constructed
this
castle?
For
this
dead
guy.
They
must
have
too
much
money
to
build
a
castle
to
a
dead.
So
you
are
reading
that
book?
I've
never
seen
you
reading
before.
If
we
have
luck,
we'll
dig
our
own
grave
to
die
in.
Don't
say
that,
it
brings
bad
luck.
Are
you
number
3-12?
Yes.
I'm
Shimitzu
Back
there
is
some
place.
Don't
take
it
personal
His
friend
Kachiwara
died.
That
was
his
place
But
won't
we
all
die?
Isn't
that
the
plan?
To
die
for
your
country
is
an
honor.
Shimitzu,
where
are
you
from?
Saigo,
you're
from
there,
too,
right?
That's
right.
Where
did
they
train
you?
Perhaps
we
went
to
the
same
school!
They
trained
me
in
Tokyo.
Like
me,
but
where?
In
the
Tojo
Hey...
where
was
he
trained?
I
don't
know
that
school
Surely
you
know
about
the
Kempeitei

It
was
the
academy
of
the
Kempeitei
To
complete
his
training,
they
sent
him
here...
He
behaves
like
a
Kempeitei
He
is
not
like
the
regular
guys,
I
believe
that
they
put
him
here
to
spy
on
us.
You
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying..
Perhaps
he'll
write
down
everything
we
say
in
his
letters
We
have
to
watch
out
for
that
guy!
Grass
again!
The
commander
is
conserving
the
food
for
the
battle
We
are
going
to
die
of
hunger
before
the
Americans
even
arrive.
With
my
contributions
to
the
war
We
should
be
eating
pies
and
sandwiches
I
used
to
run
a
pastry
shop
with
my
wife
in
the
city
of
Omilla
When
still
there
was
sugar.
We
sold
pies,
bread
and
casutera
But
then...
Those
guys
like
him
came
and
they
took
everything
they
wanted.
for
the
war
for
the
country!
Why
the
pies?
They
also
came
to
our
store
when
they
looked
for
clothes
When
we
began
to
make
sandwiches.
they
also
took
it
when
the
meat
finished,
and
there
was
only
bread,
they
also
took
it
in
the
end,
they
took
everything
we
had
We
had
to
close
the
business.
I
don't
have
anything
left
I
had
to
be
a
fisherman!
It
had
to
be
difficult
for
your
wife
Without
the
business
and
her
husband.
Don't
open,
we
do
not
have
anything
to
sell.
Congratulations,
your
husband
will
go
away
to
the
war
Thank
you
very
much,
it
will
be
an
honor
to
serve
the
country
Luckily
there
are
no
boys
in
the
war
Please.
we
only
have
ourselves
left...
This
is
not
the
time
for
this!
We
have
all
sent
our
spouses
and
children
to
the
war
All
we
have
paid
our
part!
At
least
you
will
have
a
son
who
can
bear
his
name!
Hanako
I
cannot
eat
with
you
What
shall
I
do
after
you
die?
I
am
not
in
the
coffin
yet!
Nobody
returns
home,
not
a
single
soul!
They
won't
let
you
return
here!
Don't
worry
yourself.
I
am
your
papa
Listen
Don't
tell
anybody
what
I'm
about
to
tell
you!
it
is
a
secret
between
you
and
me
Your
papa
is
going
to
return
home
to
you
nobody
will
be
able
to
prevent
that
Listen.the
enemy
approaches!
This
is
ridiculous.
Why
waste
our
time
making
tunnels?
With
or
without
them
we
are
going
to
die
But
we
could
have
set
up
our
barrikades
at
the
beaches
What
can
I
do
for
you,
Sir?
You
want
something
to
drink?
You
have
been
looking
pale
these
days.
The
water
here
isn't
good
for
me.
that
is
not
good
Here,
I've
signed
your
plead.
I'm
asking
for
orders
to
transfer
you
away
from
this
island
and
to
have
you
replaced
by
Admiral
Ichimaru.
You
are
wasting
time
digging..
The
island
can
not
last
without
the
support
of
our
fleet.
we
will
all
die
here!
Perhaps
to
dig
the
tunnels
is
useless
Perhaps
the
defense
of
Iwo
Jima
is
useless
Perhaps
all
this
war
is
useless
But
we
are
not
going
away
to
surrender.
We
will
fight
them
until
we
die,
I
and
all
the
other
soldiers!
If
our
children
can
live
without
danger
it
will
be
worth
the
trouble
to
face
the
enemy
on
this
island.
So
I'm
asking
you,
please!
If
you
have
even
a
trace
of
the
officer's
pride
left
in
you
You
go
and
tell
the
headquarters
that
we
need
all
the
support
that
we
can
get!
Then
the
rumor
is
true.
I
could
not
believe
it!
I'm
thankful
to
be
able
to
leave
this
island
We
had
our
differences
but
I'm
sad
that
you
are
going
away.
General
Adachi,
now
everything
depends
on
You
Kuribayashi
should
be
behind
some
writing-desk
But
not
a
commander
of
troops.
I
know
what
you
are
feeling....
As
it
is
generally
agreed...
It
is
most
probable
that
the
Americans
will
disembark
in
this
zone
The
crossed
firing
positions
will
be
located
here
and
here.
It
is
well
known
that
we
will
be
numerically
inferior
in
all
regards.
but
we
have
an
enormous
advantage
Can
anybody
tell
me
what
that
is?
The
will
of
the
American
is
inferior
to
the
will
of
the
Japanese.
Very
well
Shimizu!
but
why
is
that
so?
Because
they
are
not
disciplined,
and
their
feelings
interfere
with
their
reason.
This
is
the
American
uniform!
this
must
be
your
target!
The
Americans
will
lose
many
men
in
this
attempt.
Understood?
Yes
Sir
General,
can
I
speak
to
you?
You
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
Major
General
Adachi
Thanks
for
the
warning
but
we
do
not
have
time
for
that
now
We
must
focus
on
what
we
will
do
in
the
precise
moment
of
the
attack
Admiral
Ichimaru!
Ichimaru
reports
to
his
duties,
Sir.
With
your
permission,
Sir.
Thanks
for
coming
here
so
quickly!
Air
raid!
Jupiter!
Jupiter!
Hey,
what
are
you
doing
standing
around
there?
Come
and
help
me!
Can
I
put
something
into
your
report
mail?
It's
just
one
small
letter...
We
have
been
here
for
months,
right?
They
had
already
scared
us
into
feeling
unsafe.
They
are
not
going
to
stop
until
they've
killed
us!
Damn
day
and
night
day
and
night!
This
drives
me
crazy!
If
the
damn
Americans
want
to
invade
here
so
badly...
then
why
can't
they
do
it
now?
The
4
chickens
that
they
gave
us
a
few
months
ago
have
grown
much
the
mother
hen
takes
them
to
collect
food
every
day
but
they
are
also
eating
all
the
flower
that
grow
in
my
orchard
The
American
boats
are
about
to
to
weigh
anchor!
They
are
on
their
way...
prepare
the
troops
Yes
Sir!
The
moment
has
arrived
for
us
to
show
our
character
..
as
members
of
the
Imperial
Honorable
Army
I
trust
that
you
will
fight
with
honor
This
island
has
a
vital
importance
for
Japan
if
this
island
falls
the
enemy
will
use
it
as
it
a
base
to
attack
our
country
with
its
airplanes
For
Japan!
For
our
Mother
country!
Until
the
last
man
The
enemy
is
due
to
stop,
here!
Many
will
die
but
not
before
killing
10
enemy
soldiers
each!
They
do
not
hope
to
return
to
house
alive
I
always
will
be
to
the
front,
accompanying
them!
Hirohito
Emperor
lives!
Banzai.Banzai
Banzai!
Dear
wife,
I
think
of
you
much,
I
wish
you
that
you
are
well
that
you
have
value
until
the
end.
and
the
spirit
of
Yamato
with
you
my
heart
always
will
be
with
you.
Takeishi.
We
have
to
fill
gunpowder
bags
here
It's
always
hard
for
us
to
imagine
they
get
to
use
in
battle
Tardi
and
Iyoko,
are
joking
about
it
all
the
time
My
parents,
were
evacuated
to
Nagano
and
they
are
well
I
pray
for
your
security
sincerely,
Yoshi.
Nobody
can
kill
me
now!
A
lucky
belt!
my
wife
also
sent
one
to
me
It
seems
to
me
that
the
rest
does
not
have
belts
like
us
Perhaps
they
think
that
they
wouldn't
fit
under
their
uniforms
Or
perhaps
they
don't
believe
in
lucky
charms.
His
mother
sent
him
one,
too...
Watch
out,
if
you
stick
out
your
head
too
much
a
wing
from
a
plane
could
hit
it.
How
many
ships
you
think
that
they
have?
At
least
30,
perhaps
50!
They
must
be
closely
together.
Don't
go
to
the
water-drainage,
it's
too
dangerous.
then
where?
The
latrine
is
full!
Somebody
must
drain
it
Saigo!
You
do
something
about
that
latrine
Carry
the
excrements
out!
Yes!
It
must
be
a
damn
joke...
I
always
end
up
in
such
a
mess!
Thanks
God,
I'm
not
dead!
Shall
we
open
fire,
Sir?
Not
yet!
The
men
wish
to
begin
to
shoot.
Not
yet!
Do
not
shoot,
do
not
shoot
If
we
do
not
defend
ourselves,
soon
they
will
take
the
beach!
Let's
wait
until
the
beach
is
full!
This
is
the
moment!
Open
fire!
Open
fire
They
destroyed
the
tubes,
and
also
the
fortifications
of
the
beach
the
other
forces
are
intact!
We
killed
at
least
thousand
enemy
troops!
We
knew
that
they
would
destroy
the
forts.
those
are
good
news
How
are
the
men
of
Sibashi?
How
is
the
situation
of
the
enemy?
There
must
be
more
than
that,
they
even
have
men
waiting
in
the
flanks
The
enemy
front
extends
from
the
Zuribachi
and
the
wharf
And
the
landing
field
Shidonio
to
the
south.
The
Suribachi
and
the
field
of
Motoyama.
They
are
mounting
an
attack
in
two
ends.
I
can't
give
supply,
I
need
the
ammunition!
Saigo!
Man
this
position!
What
are
you
doing?
stupid
idiot!
I
cannot
trust
you,
tell
Colonel
Adachi
that
we
need
another
machine
gun!
Hurry!
Colonel
Adachi
asks
for
reinforcements.
There
they
are,
kill
them!
What
happened?
There
is
no
ammunition!
Cover
me!
We
are
losing
the
Suribachi
everything
is
lost
I
ask
for
permission
to
command
our
troops
to
commit
suicide.
No,
you
must
try
to
stop
them!
Try
to
survive,
and
unite
with
the
forces
of
the
North
But
Sir.
everything
depends
on
holding
the
Suribachi.
I
will
end
my
life
with
honor,
next
to
my
men
No,
Colonel.
It
is
an
order!
Adachi!
Adachi!
Sir!
Captain
Tanida
asks
for
machine
guns
We
are
defeated!
Suicide
is
the
only
option
that
we
have
left
But
Sir...
Listen,
General
Kuribayashi
gave
the
Colonel
orders
not
to...
It
is
cowardly
to
think
so.
Sit
down!
Men
we
are
honorable
soldiers
of
the
emperor
never
forget
that!
the
only
way
we
have
left.
is
to
die
with
honor!
this
is
our
destiny
to
end
our
lifes
in
the
traditional
way
I
will
see
you
there!
For
the
emperor!
Banzai
.....
Banzai
.....
Banzai
Soldiers
good
bye!
Hold!
You
must
die
like
a
honorable
soldier!
Shimizu,
listen!
We
have
to
unite
with
the
troops
in
the
north
We
must
remain
here
until
the
death!
that
is
what
he
said
by
the
radio
it
is
the
truth
we
can
die
right
here
or
we
can
continue
fighting
Which
serves
the
emperor
best?
Both
is
acceptable!
Where
will
the
east
corridor
lead
us
to?
Near
Motoyama.
You
have
order
to
retreat?
And
the
rest
of
your
men?
They
must
be
out
there
very
closely.
Silence!
That
is
for
killing
us,
and
even
burning
us
alive
No,
please!
Have
you
heard
anything
from
the
Suribachi?
No
Sir!
Lieutenant
Oiso,
he
ordered
us
to
meet
up
with
the
troops
in
the
western
cavern.
We
will
try
to
arrive
at
Motoyama.
The
next
two
kilometers
will
be
unprotected
terrain
Each
one
will
be
responsible
for
himself.
we
will
see
ourselves
again
on
the
other
side.
If
not
on
this
earth,
it
will
be
in
the
other
world.
Prepare
yourself
Better
don't
run
with
the
pack,
they
are
going
to
shoot
at
them,
stay
back
that's
how
the
cowardly
do!
a
dead
soldier
isn't
worth
anything.
Follow
me
Waits
until
the
flare
is
out
Get
going!
Did
the
messengers
make
it?
Adachi...
The
transmitter
at
Motoyama
still
works.
Why
not
try
that,
Sir?
The
remaining
troops
of
the
Suribachi
What
is
your
name?
You
escaped
from
the
Suribachi?
How
could
you
dare?
You
had
to
remain
in
you
position,
until
death.
You
should
have
died
with
the
others
soldiers
of
your
group.
You
are
a
shame!
Get
on
your
knees!
Listen..
I
don't
kill
my
soldiers
with
no
need.
Lower
that
sword
now.
Lower
it
already!
What
is
happening
here?
These
men
fled
from
the
Suribachi.
Lieutenant
Ito,
I
issued
them
the
order
to
retreat.
That
is
sad,
General.
That
was
our
only
chance.
Now
that
they
have
taken
the
Suribachi,
the
enemy
will
take
over
the
hills.
We
must
take
control
back
over
the
North.
Ito.
Fight
by
your
fallen
comrades.
until
the
end
Rise
General
Adachi
orders
to
go
to
us
right
now.
No,
Kuribayashi
ordered
us
to
hold
this
position...
The
Lieutenant
Ito
says
that
Kuribayashi
is
weak,
and
he
compares
him
with
the
enemy.
We
will
recover
mount
Suribachi!
Where
is
General
Adachi?
Tell
me,
who
is
in
control
here?
That's
not
so
certain,
Sir.
Remain
here
until
the
plan
is
decided!
Charge!
we
will
hold
this
position,
take
care
of
the
ammunition
Why
didn't
this
regiment
take
part
in
the
attack?
Don't
stay
here
like
rats.
Leave
your
caves
and
fight!
where
is
your
commander?
We
do
not
know
anything,
nothing
is
said
to
us
here
You
did
not
receive
the
order
of
Adachi?
Kuribayashi
revoced
that
order.
There
will
be
no
attack
We
will
take
the
Suribachi
again!
With
or
without
Kuribayashi!
There
are
enemies
attacking
already.
Remember
your
rank
Lieutenant!
Your
lack
of
respect
is
unacceptable.
I
suggest
you
better
return
to
your
men
now.
We
don't
need
you
here.
You
are
a
coward!
That
guy
who
violated
the
rules,
that
is
the
Officer
who
almost
killed
to
us.
I
will
not
return.
I
have
enough
of
fighting
in
caves.
It
does
not
make
sense
to
me.
You
are
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Nishi
now.
This
will
destroy
an
enemy
tank.
Take
out
one
of
their
machines!
There
you
go.
What
is
the
Situation?
We
lost
thousand
men
in
a
suicidal
attack.
I
passed
the
strict
order
not
to.
Adachi,
be
damned!
What
about
the
Americans?
If
they
entered
the
western
hill,
we
will
be
surrounded
by
three
fronts
This
order
just
arrived,
Sir!
From
the
Headquarters
We
lament
the
fallen
reinforcements
in
the
combat
for
victory.
we
hope
sincerely,
that
you
fight
with
honor
and
that
you
die
for
your
country

That
one
is
still
alive!

him
inside
Shall
I
kill
him?
But
Sir...
we
have
very
little
morphine
the
Americans
would
not
take
care
of
the
Japanese
like
that
Son,
how
many
Americans
do
you
know?
Take
care
of
him.
Endo
American
tanks,
come
here!
Endo,
how
is
the
prisoner?
he
is
awake,
Sir
I
will
try
to
interrogate
him.
It's
all
shit.
Are
you
talking
to
me?
I
will
run
away
and
surrender.
So
why
have
you
been
sent
to
us?
To
spy
on
us,
right=
to
suppress
unpatriotic
thinking?
They
put
to
me
here
because
They
threw
me
out
of
the
Kempeitai
Why?
I
have
only
been
their
for
five
days...
Shimizu,
you
always
must
be
firm.
If
you
have
compassion,
people
will
take
advantage
of
your
weakness
that
is
unpatriotic
behavior.
Do
something
about
it,
Shimizu
You
haven't
raised
the
imperial
flag!
I'm
sorry,
my
husband
went
to
the
war
and
I
cannot
reach
up
there
It
is
unpatriotic
not
to
raise
it.
Bring
that
dog
away
from
the
streets-
What
did
you
say,
Sir?
That
is
an
annoyance,
it
interrupts
the
communications
I'm
very
sorry,
Sir!
Shinizu,
silence
that
dog.
We
cannot
allow
that
it
interferes
with
military
orders.
Take
the
dog
away
please,
it
will
not
happen
again
take
it
to
the
back
and
bring
the
children
inside.
hurry
Put
it
inside
and
try
that
it
does
not
bark.
Yes,
thank
you
so
much!
Done
already.
Are
you
trying
to
make
fun
of
me?
You
can't
even
kill
a
dog?
You
will
never
be
one
of
us!
you
are
not
patriotic!
Get
up
they
threw
me
out
for
the
insubordination
and
they
commanded
me
here
That
is
sad
only
the
enemy
hates
you...
it
is
not
the
dog's
fault

Having

spoiled

the

Hey
Sam!
It
is
information
on
the
attack?
Not,
it
is
only
a
letter
It
is
from

mother
Sam
I
sent
a
pair
of
books
for

I

Endo
What
a
mess,
we
don't
have
any
more
medicine.
Stop
it,
it
makes
no
sense.
Help
the
others!
Okubo,
come
here!
Have
we
run
out
of
ammunition?
No,
we
haven't,
Sir.
They
eliminated
our
mortars
there
is
no
more
ammunition
for
the
machine
guns
we
only
have
rifles
left.
Okubo,
You
are
in
charge
of
the
men
now
we
can
No
longer
defend
this
zone
Take
the
men,
the
food
and
the
ammunition
and
try
to
make
your
way
to
the
north!
And
You
Sir?
I've
already
had
enough
of
sharing
this
cave
with
you...
I
will
stay
here
and
try
to
face
the
enemy.
What
are
you
saying,
Sir?
First
thing
you
have
to
do
is
find
water
for
the
men!
Men!
you
take
the
pain.
you
do
the
right
thing,
because
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do.
you
understand?
Yes
Sir!
I
promise
that
we
will
send
you
food
and
medicine!
it
has
been
an
honor
to
serve
next
to
you!
Let's
move
out.
Okubo..
My
rifle.
Thanks,
Okubo.
And
the
reports?
Any
additional
News?
Adachi
is
in
Donichi.
I
sent
messengers
They
have
sent
to
many
No
of
them
has
returned.
It
shouldn't
have
gone
this
way.
Saigo
I
have
been
thinking
about
what
Colonel
Nishi
said
Yes
it's
right.
I
don't
know
nothing
about
the
enemy
I
thought
that
the
Americans
were
cowardly
I
was
wrong,
they
aren't.
they
taught
this
to
me,
said
it
to
me
so
many
times...
But
that
American
soldier...
the
words
of
his
mother...
they
were
the
same
words
that
my
mother
said
to
me..
I
want
to
fulfill
my
duty
for
my
General
and
my
country
but
I
do
not
want
to
die
without
reason
Saigo
What
do
you
think?
I
don't
think
anything
anymore.
I
think
we
went
through
enough
of
it
all
because
we
are
sacrificing
ourselves!
You
will
surrender
with
me?
Well-taken
care
of
Ten
I
think
you
should
go
first..
I
am
going
to
make
up
some
excuse,
so
I
can
leave.
we
will
meet
somewhere
outside
and
we
disappear
before
they
notice
it.
You
have
to
leave
because
you
have
dysentery
Put
on
your
dysentery
face!
That
should
do
it...
Stop!
Where
are
you
going?
I
have
dysentery!
If
you
are
going
to
do
it,
take
me
with
you!
We
will
have
to
move
silently
now...
Soldiers,
where
are
you
going?
One
of
them
does
not
feel
well,
he
has
dysentery
Stop!
You
idiot,
it
was
your
guard!
Watch
out
for
those
deserters!
In
which
unit
have
you
been?
in
the
3-14
of
Ygashiyama
I
heard
that
they
give
you
real
food
here...
food?

it
sounds
well.
I
also
am
from
Yokohama
When
all
this
is
over,
you
can
come
visit
me.
Lieutenant,
look
at
this!
That
should
serve
to
you
as
a
lesson
to
everyone
who
wants
to
surrender!
We
must
pass
through
the
crossfire
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
North
and
thus
to
unite
with
our
forces
Listen
We
will
move
until
those
caves,
we
will
leave
there
do
not
waste
the
ammunition,
not
a
single
bullet
Do
not

Prepare
to
cross!
Try

the
troops
of
Nishi,
and
survivors
of
the
Zuribache
No
officers
with
you?
I
congratulate
you
on
arriving
here
Fujita,
some
water
for
them!
Fujita
I'm
sorry,
Sir,
there
is
no
more
water.
I'm
very
sorry.
But
at
least
you
will
be
able
to
rest
for
some
time.
You
seem
well-known
to
me...
Yes
Sir!
You
saved
my
life
on
two
ocassions!
The
first
time,
it
was
the
day
in
which
you
arrived
at
the
Island.
Yes,
I
remember
that
clearly.
Take
some
rest
now.
Hanako,
I
am
not
sure
that
this
letter
arrives
at
destiny.
but
it
calms
me
to
write
to
you
We
have
spent
the
last
five
days
without
water
or
food.
in
order
to
survive,
we
are
doing
things
that
I
won't
describe
to
you.
There
is
no
escape
for
me
any
more,
so
that
the
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
you
and
the
baby.
Here,
drink
some
alcohol
the
battle
approaches
its
end
without
ammunition
nor
water
to
drink.
All
the
survivors
will
make
a
general
attack
pray
for
the
victory
and
security
of
the
Empire,
I
am
saying
goodbye
to
you!
Unfortunately,
I
couldn't
fulfill
all
my
duties
for
the
mother
country.
Without
decent
fighting,
we
had
to
lose
in
these
conditions.
You
survived
the
Zuribachi?
it
had
to
be
an
incredible
trip?
You
are
everything
a
soldier...
you
are
a
baker?
You
have
family?
I
have
wife,
and
a
baby
who
was
born
during
the
last
summer
in
Umilla.
And
I
didn't
get
to
know
it
yet.
That
strange
I
promised
myself
to
fight
until
the
death
for
my
family
But
to
think
about
my
family,
makes
it
difficult
to
me
to
fulfill
the
promise
We
have
received
a
message

It
is
urgent

honor

personal
belongings.
everything
is
happening
three
times.
We
will
mount
a
general
attack.
although
Sakama
is
lost
today
our
country
praised
our
dedication
it
bequeathed
the
day
in
which
they
cried
and
they
said
by
its
souls
but
today,
we
must
give
everything
by
our
country,
until
the
death
I
will
always
be
to
the
front
of
you
my
saber
will
be
the
legacy,
and
my
bones

trophy
Begin
to
shoot
Banzai!
No
more..
no
more...
Fujita
It
is
an
order
You
again...
I
want
to
ask
you
a
favor
Bury
me,
so
that
nobody
can
find
me
Taro.
Soon
I
will
arrive
at
home
I
am
glad
of
being
able
to
do
it
but
I
feel
sad
to
leave
my
friends
here
I
was
driving
my
vehicle
but
I
felt
quite
lonely
Is
this
Japanese
soil?
Yes!
this
continues
being
Japan
We
found
something
We
have
Something
Those
are
letters...
