Where
the
damn
fighters
going?

They've
gone
chasing
scalps,
Damn
those
glory-grabbing
bastards!
Bandits!
Hundreds
of
them!
Six
o'clock!


Is
there
anything
left
of
our
escort?
Negative,
boss.
Damn
it!
Why
don't
they
worry
about
us?
I
can't
believe
this!
It
never
fails.

Oh,
no.
Stay
with
me.


This
is
Bouncing
Betty.
We're
falling
back.
Need
the
extinguisher.
Hank!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Prepare
to
bail
out.
I
repeat,
prepare
to
bail...

Red
One
to
Red
Two,
come
in.
Are
you
awake
over
there,
Lightning?

Yeah,
yeah,
sorry.
Boy,
I
need
a
nap!
Well,
look
alive.
War
is
hell.

Whoever
she
was,
Oh,
trust
me,
she
was
worth
it!
:
Fine
as
wine,
Red
One.
:
Joker,
you
all
right?
Nope.
I
feel
like
Coolant
indicator's
all
over
the
map.
And
to
think
I
was
as
happy
All
right,
Red
Four,
you're
done.
Come
on
now,
Captain,
Captain,
let
me
give
it
a
looky
He's
not
trailing
any
oil
or
water.
Seems
to
me
Come
on,
Easy.
Let
me
fly,
sir,
please?
You
know
it
ain't
gonna
be

All
right.
Okay.
You
stay
on,
Red
Four.
You
stay
on,
but
you
keep
an
eye
on
it,
Thank
you,
sweetheart.
Just
my
luck
Another
P-40
from
Uncle
Sam's
junkyard.
It
looks
like
we
got
a
truck
up
there.
It's
got
German
markings.
-
Junior,
it's
your
turn.
Prepare
to
feel
the
wrath
of
the
Ray
Gun.
I'm
on
your
wing,
Junior!
Come
on.
You
see
that?
Congratulations,
kid.
Whoo-hoo!
We
can
go
back
victorious.
Everybody,
form
up.
We're
going
home.
Uh...
Easy,
I
see
something.
it's
a
train!
I
don't
think
it's
German.
Looks
like
they're
moving
livestock
to
me.
No.
it's
military.
It's
camouflaged.
It
could
just
be
cows.
You
don't
want
to
shoot
up
no
cows
Unless
y'all
planning
on
a
barbecue.
Nobody
sees
any
guns?
I'm
telling
you,
Easy,
And
I
bet
it's
armed
to
the
teeth.
You
grown-ups
better
think
fast.
All
right.
Only
one
way
to
find
out.
Wait.
Easy,
we
got
to
take
it
head-on,
It's
my
decision,
Lightning.

Looks
like
these
cows
are
armed.
Come
on.
Stay
in
front
of
it!
Die,
you
Nazi
dogs!
Dang!
Those
cows
just
shot
up
my
wing!
No
sweat.
No
sweat.
If
that
train
makes
it
into
the
tunnel,
Where's
Lightning?
Where
the
hell
are
you,
Lightning?
Taking
the
train
from
the
front,

Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Gotcha!
Whoa!
Shit!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Nothing
like
Just
trying
to
keep
you
boys
inspired.

I
can't

you
do
that,

gonna

You're
a
clown,

We
can't

have
any

What
is
this?
What
did
you
do?
:
Oh,
man!
-
What
happened
was...
Come
see
what
this
clown
did
to
the

I
can
see
what
you're
thinking.
What
the
hell
is
this?
Coffee,
I
can
see
you're
upset.
Maybe
we
should
talk
Oh,
we
got
a
new
recruit
here!
Hey
there.
You
lost,
son?
I
was
looking
for

Well,

I'm

He's

I'm
going
to

for

are

you
disobey

I
told

No,

followed

not

Okay.
You're
right,
I'm
wrong.
I'm
sorry.
What
you
in
such
a
hurry
for
anyway?
I
saw
a

I

in

bunk
with

would
make
you
my

make

Better
at

for

Now
if
you're
done
whining,
I
have
got
-
Lightning.
Can
I
ask
you
something?
What's
going
to

go
home
and

understand

this?
Something
to

"thank
you"
wouldn't
hurt.
And

you,
you're
just
tired

myself

that
might
be
it.

you
feel?

whole

than

older.

you.

all
hot
and
bothered.

Coffee!

got
three

Grab
a
piece
of
that
tape
What
are
you
doing,
Lightning?
What?
What
did
you
say?
Come
on,
Lightning.
I
need
it
back
by
nightfall!
And
ask
if
she's
got
a
sister!
Yeah,
a
blind
one!
I'm
sorry
to
bother
you.
I
flew
around

house
this
morning.

Okay.


Right,
you...
Si.

was

I'm

-
D'accordo.

Thanks.

Little.

I
hope
I'm
not
intruding,

Thank
you.
Ah!

Ah!


Hold
on.
I
want
to
ask
you
something.

How?
Oh,
how?
I
got
a
Jeep.
Dove?
What's
dove?
Dove,
Is
that
a
yes?

You
want
to
bring
your
mother?
It's
going
to
be
tougher
than
I
thought.

What
you
going
with?

And

of

never
be

ask

about

wants

to
go

school,

ought
to
just
give
it
up!
I'd
rather
be
up
there
killing
Jerries
than
down
here
playing
games
:
Look,
don't
be
in
a
hurry
Tell
me
something.
You
scared
of
dying?
I
don't
know.
I
am.
Every
time
I
close
the
lid
on
that
canopy,
I
feel
like
I'm
shutting
the
lid

tell

can't

Send
them
off.


Hallelujah.

Watch
me
become
an
ace
today,
boys.
Lightning,
did
you
just
say
you're
gonna
I
couldn't
quite
hear
what
you...
Was
it
ass
or
ace?
I
couldn't
hear.
I
think
you
heard
him
right,
Smokey.
All
right,
men,
cut
the

Oh,

Yes.
They're

Straighten
up
over
there,
Junior.
Let's
go,
Lightning.
I'm
on
one.
:
I
got
him.
Get
on
the
inside,
easy!
Come
on,
slip
just
a
little.
Come
on,
tighter,
tighter.

Congratulations,

You
are

There's
my
swastika.
I'm
on

wing.
Come
on,
baby,
just
move
a
little
bit
Just
give
me

Good
shot.


Oh,
hell.
Joker,
there's
one
on
my
tail!
Okay,
listen,
Junior.
Come
on.
No
touchdown
for
you
today,

you're
all
clear,

I
see
him.
Let's
give

says
hello!
There's

leader.
Careful.
He's
good.

You're
letting
him
get
away,
Lightning!
I'm
just
toying
with
him.
This
is
for
you,
Pretty
Boy,
Come
on,
boy.
Line
it
up.
One
shot.
Holy
crap!
How'd
he
do
that?
-
Get
him
off
me!
-
:
Get
him
off
me!
Open
your
throttle.
Come
on,
man!
:
I
can't
get
a
clear
shot.
Drop
to
your
right.
All
right!
I
got
him.
Oh!
Thank
you,
Lord.
And
there
I
was
thinking
He's
headed
home
to
mama.
You
thinking
what
I'm
thinking?

If
you're
thinking
so
we
can
get
back
to
the
beachhead,
:
Or
we
could
follow
him.
We
could
go
after
their
airdrome.
I
don't
know,
Lightning.
We
got
orders.
Come
on,
Easy.
Dozens
of
planes!
You're
saying
no?
All
right.
But
we're
running
low
on
fuel.
You
got
that?
Five
minutes.

Joker,
you
back
there?
We're
still
back
here.
Junior?
I'm
ready
for
a
turkey
shoot.

Mayday!
Mayday!

There
it
is,
boys.
Gotta
knock
out
those
fighters
Got
to
take
those
guns
out
first.


Everybody,
form
up.
Here
we
go!
Brand-new
1095.
Not
so
brand-new
1095.


Like
ducks
in
a
row.
All
right.
Two
at
once!
That's
nothing.
Touchdown!
:
No
time
for
celebration.
Whoo!
The
Ray
Gun
strikes
again.
Junior,
watch
out
for
that
flak!


Good
job,
Lightning.
Washington

My
God!
Those
pilots
are
African!
Hey!
What
happened
to
Junior?
There
he
is.
Three
o'clock
high.
He's
trailing
oil.
Red
One
to
Red
Three.
Junior,
come
in.
:
Something
in
my
head.
Level
off,
Junior,
All
right.

Oh,
yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!

Whoa!
They
done
shot
down
the
whole
Luftwaffe,
Yes,
they
did,
huh?

Never
doubted
it.
Did
I
make
it?
Yeah,
you
made
it,
damn
knucklehead.
You'll
be
okay.
:
No
surprises,
Ray
Gun.
Luck
is
with
you,
Ray!

I
think
we
can
cautiously
declare
It's
a
slog,
but
the
ground
troops
Sir.
Your
boys
chalked
eight
kills
in
the
air,
No
losses
in
their
first
wave.
Pass
along
my
congratulations.
Thank
you,
sir.

it
still
doesn't
change
We
don't
care.
Respect
the

Believe
me,
sir,
It's
not
as
bad
as
all
this.
Leg's
good,
eye's
fine.
In
a
week's
time,
I'll
be
able
to
see
fine
out
of
one
eye
"Mostly".
Is
that
what
you
want
me
to
tell
Stance?
"Sir,
Ray
Gun
has
one-and-a-half
eyes'
Look,
come
on.
-
Lightning...
If
the
Flight
Surgeon
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do?
Just...
talk
to
him.
I
mean,
you
got
the
same
respect
I'd
rather
be
dead
than
on
the
ground.
Easy,
you're
the
best
friend
I
got.
Please
don't
do
this
to
me.
General
Luntz,
Colonel
Bullard.
:
Thank
you,
Lieutenant.
-
Colonel,
please.
No,
thank
you,
sir.
Colonel,
I'm
in
a
hell
of
a
fix
Our
boys
are
getting
cut
to
shreds.
I
read
the
action
report
Eight
kills
in
your
first
wave.
That's
a
right
trick.
Colonel,
I'll
give
it
to
you
straight.
I
can't
afford
the
kind
of
losses
Do
you
have
film
of
the
air
cover
:
We
need
to
change
I
need
pilots
who
will
fly
close
and
tight
Not
put
my
men
in
harm's
way
So
you're
asking
me
to
tell
my
men
I'm
asking
them
to
put
the
bombers
I
don't
care
if
they
never
splash
I
need
to
get
my
heavies
The
losses
from
enemy
air,
I
believe
If
you
can
bring
back
one
or
two
more
Sir,
I
believe
we
can
cut
your
losses
Colonel,
the
word
is
you're
arrogant.
If
"arrogant"
is
the
only
word
I
would
say
I
think
I'm
making
progress.
Can
you
help
us?
Can
you
help
save
lives?
We
need
new
planes.
If
you
get
us
new
planes,
we
can
help
your
boys.
I
got
a
bullet
right
through
my
canopy.
But
nothing
happened
to
me
though.
Oh,
go
on
with
that.
Let's
play.
Don't
sass
Black
Jesus,
What
happened
to
you
is
luck.
Just
luck.

Poker,

Fairy,
Easter
Bunny,
all
of
them!
I
done
lost
all
my
damn
money.
:
Ain't
that
right.
How
about
you
just
get
wise?
There
is
no
special
mojo
Things
just
are
how
they
are.

shot
up...
and

we're
protecting

I
hear
that.
:
You
talk
real
tough,
Well,
reality's
a
little
chilly.

:
Is
that
right?
Let
me
tell
you
about
While
y'all
trying
to
get
by

what
he's
doing
with
his

What's
that?
Trading

all
for

Oh,
really?
-
:
Perfume,

:
That
tease!
Yeah,
well,
lucky
at
love
Right
like
that.
Boom!
Man,
you
are
so
beautiful.
Of
course,

I
love
you.
Oh,
uh...
Wow,
that's...
Uh...

Uh...

What
are
you
doing
here?
I
am

Hey.
Go

I
came
for.
Good
night.

I'm

I
was
finishing

they
started!
Wrong
or
right,
we
got
regs
to
live
by.
And
you
throwing
punches,
A
good
feeling,
Easy.
Right
here.
A
throb
that
says
I
didn't
choke
-
How
do
your
heart
feel?
Same
as
always.
"Don't
scare

speaking

worth
Ugh;
Same
old

Still
getting
into
the
wrong
fights

any
better?
You
spent

You

did
it,

Come

Let's
get
some
food.
Welcome
home,
Colonel.
:
Lieutenant
Little.
Everything's
a
fight,
isn't
it?
It
must
be
so
goddamn
exhausting
You
know
something,
Joe
Little?
You're
a
punk.
You
remind
me...
of
one
of
those
kids
from
a
comic
strip,
walking
around,
pushing
his
sleeve
up
one
arm,
hand
balled
in
a
tight
fist,
walking
and
looking
at
the
world
Always
looking
to
knock
something
down
It's
right
there.
It's
right
there.
You
really
want
to
knock
something
down?
Try
using
that.
Because
I
will
tell
you
straight,
I
have
the
highest
expectations
for
you.
Lieutenant
Little,
I
need
everyone
on
this
next
mission.
And
you're
lucky
Report
to
your
unit.
(BLESS
YOY,
FOR
BEING
AN
ANGEL
Bless
you
For
being
an
angel
Just
when
it
seemed
That
heaven
was
not
for
me
Bless
you,
for
building...
They
let
you
out,
huh?
Or
did
you
bust
out?
Very
funny.
Look,
I
said
some
things.
Yeah,
you
did.
I
didn't
mean
them.
Yeah,
you
did.
You
know
me.
Act
first,
think
later.
Well,
nobody's
perfect.
We
good?
Yeah,
we're
good.

I
figured
it
out.
What?
That
throwing
punches
No.
That
maneuver
got
on
my
tail,
Fancy
trick
flying
Or
make
me
an
ace.

The
American
pilots
flying

now
That's
how
they
were
trained.
Here's
how
we
change
up
the
strategy.
At
all
costs,
under
every
circumstance,
Colonel.
We
signed
up
to
shoot
Germans,
:
One
bomber,
that's
10
men.
You
getting
one
Jerry
that
doesn't
balance
that.
We
count
our
victories...
by
the
bombers
we
get
to
their
targets.
By
the
husbands
By
the
fathers
What
has
not
changed,
from
the
last
plane,
to
the
last
bullet,
to
the
last
man,
we
fight.
We
fight!
:
Yes,
sir!
We've
secured
new
aircrafts.

The
best
the
AAF's
got.
As
soon
as
we
get
the
A-okay,
Dismissed.
Say
cheese,
say
cheese.
Whoo-hoo!
My,
my,
my!
Hey,
Maurice!
How
are
they
flying?
Like
angels.
I
don't
know
any
angels
All
right,
men,
get
your
manuals.
-
Coffee!
We'll
need
them
all
marked
up
It's
taken
care
of.
The
Major
says

Like

Red
Baron.

Beautiful.

This
will
definitely
make
Bright

You
can't
call
us
nothing
else

From
now
on
Never
saw
the
sun
shining
so
bright
Never
saw
things
going
so
right
What
do
you
think?
It's
like
it's
speeding
I
never
even
met
a
girl
Well,
take
good
care
of
her.
What
do
you
mean?
I
twisted
the
Flight
Surgeon's
arm.
Got
you
back
on
the
roster.

Uh...
Sorry.
Thank
you,
sir.
I'm
going
to
tell
the
guys.
:
Heavenly
Father,
we
thank
you
We
ask
that
you
send
your
angels
down
We
know
that
we've
made
it
all
the
way
We
are
very
confident
in
our
abilities,
but
we
ask
that
you
give
us
and
the
speed
and
power
All
the
airmen
say,
:
Amen.
-
:
Nothing's
difficult.
-
:
Through
adversity...
From
the
last
plane,
to
the
last
minute,
-
:
We
fight!
Anybody
got
eyes
on
the
bombers?
Uh...
we
are
all
by
our
lonesome,
Red
One.
Right
on
target,
and
according
We're
here.
They're
not.
Maybe
the
bombers
turned
back.
Damn!
Maybe
they
went
on
without
us.
Red
One,
there
they
are.
Nine
o'clock
low.
Junior,

What?
What?
You
heard
Colonel
Bullard.
God,
I
hate
this
war.
:
Look

We'll
have
to
do
this
the
hard
way.
Break!
:
Here
we
go,
Lightning.
Right
behind
you.
Where'd
this
jackass
come
from?
Get
out
of
there,
Lightning!
Don't
you
worry
about
me.
Stop
fooling
around!
Damn

I'm
coming.
:
No,
you're
not,
stay
put,
I'm
gonna
show
him
Whoo!
Ha-ha!
Lightning,
when
are
you
gonna
learn
Coming
up
on
anti-aircraft
guns.

Back
off!
We'll
get
'em
on
the
way
back...
Break!
Break!
Those
Jerries
are
hightailing
it
Flak's
getting
thick.
Break
off.
Circle
clear
of
the
flak
Good
luck,
bombardiers!
All
bombs
away!
Here
they
come.
Form
up.

Move
in...
concentrate
on
the
stragglers!
Hey,
Junior!
Get
outta
there.
Junior,
get
outta
there!
Where
is
he?
Ah!
Junior,
where
are
you?
Are
you
all
right?
I'm
all
right!
Junior,
you
ire

Ere!
Junior,
get
out
of
the
plane!
Junior!
Come
on,
Junior,
bail!
Geronimo!
We
didn't
lose
a
single
plane.
Well,
that's
a
first.
Red
One,
Deke's
trailing
fuel!
Don't
look
good.
Deke,
talk
to
me.
What's
your
status?
I'm
all
right.
I
got
gas
spraying
everywhere,
I'm
a
little
dizzy,
All
right,
listen
up.
I'll
give
escort
to
Deke.
No,
I'll
stay.
I'm
his
wingman.
I'll
stay.
Let
me
take
him,
Easy.
It's
my
call,
Lightning.
Your
calls
have
been
a
little
off
lately.
What?
What
are
you
talking
about?
Junior
shouldn't
have
been
up
here.
You
got
a
problem
with
you
talk
to
Bullard
about
it,
all
right?
Until
then,
I'm
in
control.
And
my
order
for
you
right
now
Damn!
All
right,
Deke,
you'll
be
all
right.
You
got
Black
Jesus
with
you,
boy!
Thanks,
Smokey.
Well,
get
me
home,
Easy.
No,
sir.
What
the
hell
put
the
Captain
He
gets
like
that
sometimes.
He
knows
good
and
well
That
boy
was
half
blind.
:
We're
almost
home.
I
hope
we
meet
up
Listen,
boys,
Our
mission
is
over.
You
guys
are
taking
the
long
way.
I'm
going
to
take
a
shortcut
Come
on
now,
Lightning.
You
know
you
got
to
stay
You
stay
with
the
slow-ass
squadron.
And
what
if
you
turn
up
missing?
Then
I'll
have
to
break
it
-
Well,
break
it
to
him
gently.
One's
a
drunk,
and
the
other
one
Smokey,
stay
with
him.
And
keep
him
out
of
trouble.
Don't
worry.
I'll
stick
with
him.
My
head,
it
hurts.
We're
almost
there,
Deke.
Stay
with
me.
Easy,
I
got
blood
all
over
me,
:
You're
gonna
be
okay,
Captain,
I'm
getting
real
dizzy.
I
need
to
rest
a
minute.
No,
no.
Stay
alert,
Deke.
I
can't
really
see
anything!
Everything's
all
blurred!
You're
slipping,
Deke!
All
right.
All
right.
You're
diving,
Deke.
Pull
up,
Deke,
pull
up!
Deke,
listen
to
me!
Pull
up,
Deke,
pull
up!
Pull
up?
Oh,
I'm
pulling
up!
I'm
pulling
up!
Come
on!
I
must
have
passed
out!
I
need
you
to
stay
with
me,
okay?
-
Just
keep
talking.
Lightning,
look!
I
still
got
ammo.
How
about
you?
Nah.
You
need
about
a
500-pound
bomb
Plus,
that
baby
got
very,
very
big
guns.
Just
watch
me.
Lightning,
no,
all
right?
Don't
be
crazy.
If
the
big
guns
don't
kill
you,
and
Coffee
is
gonna
kill
you.
Relax,
Smokey.


All
right!
That
was
fun!
Just
one
more
pass.

How
do
you
like
that,
Mr.
Hitler?

Okay.
Okay.

down.
Easy!
I

I'm
coming

hot!
I
don't

Just

But
I
talked
to

Must

What?
You've
been
drinking.

You're
going
to

on

I
brought
the
background
on
His
mother's
name
is
Dorothy.
His
wife's
name
is
Thelma.
In
particular,
Ray
loved
to
fly.
More
than
any
pilot
we
have,


You
must
be
Lt.
Gannon.
Welcome
to
Stalag
18.
You're
the
first
of
your
kind
I
hope
your
stay
will
not
be
cut
short.
Here
is
the
new
prisoner
Lieutenant
Ray
Gannon.
A
pilot
with
the
332nd.
Where
the
hell
did
you
come
from?
Lieutenant!
Sit
down.
So,
I
bet
you're
wondering
It's
not
something
I
care
to
think
about.
Don't
worry.
It's
not
so
we
can
hang
you
or
anything.
I
chose
you
because
I
know
being
colored
and
all.
We're
in
the
middle
and
we
don't
need
any
new
white
faces.
You'll
be
treated
no
differently
Any
problems,
you
tell
me.
Come
on!
Let's
go!
Move,
move,
move!
Line
it
up!
Let's
go!
I
welcome
you
to
the
332nd
Fighter
Group.

:
Jerry's
going
down!
:
I'm
telling
you,
:
That
is
a
destroyer.
Here
it
comes!
Whoo!
I
came
around
for
a
second
pass.

:
We
fight!
We
fight!
We
fight!
We
fight!
We
fight!
Mmm.

My
best
friend.
He...
He
almost
caused
the
death
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
I
am
so
glad
I
found
you.
I
want
you
to
stop,
Easy.
Stop
what?
You
can't
drink
on
duty.
I
told
you,
what
happened
to
Deke
No
one
cares
what
you
do
How
you
relax
is
your
business.
This
coming
from
a
guy
who
flies
You're
a
piece
of
work,
Joe.
You
ignore
me
up
there,
you
expect
me
to
listen
to
you
down
here.
All
right,
all
right,
all
right.
Tell
you
what.
I'll
make
you
a
deal.
You
promise
to
ditch
the
bottle,
I'll
promise
to
fly
right.
And
follow
my
orders.
And
follow
your
orders.
Happy?
Very
happy.
:
I
can't
wait
You
guys
can
go
chase
skirt.
:
What
did
you
say,
-
Odds
of
us
getting
pinched?
:
Hey,
flyboys!
That's
trouble.
Keep
walking.
:
-
He
picked
the
wrong
day.
Hey,
come
over
here!
What?
You
guys,
you're
the
Red
Tails,
right?
You
know,
Red
Tails?
Colored
boy
flyers?
Well,
I
wouldn't
necessarily
Chester
Barnes,
98th
Bomb
Group.
You
guys
flew
a
little
top
cover
for
us
A
little
run
over
Ploiesti?
It
was
the
best
goddamn
flying
And
we
guys,
well,
we
feel
that
Why
don't
you
come
and
join
us?
Come
on.
Come
and
join
them?
What's
he
saying?
Come
on.
Drinks
are
on
us.
Well,
I'll
be
damned.
I
guess
the
dance
hall
will
have
to
wait.
-
How
you
doing?

He
was
a
famous
trumpet
man
He
had
a
boogie
style
He
was
the
tap
man
at
his
craft
But
then
his
number
came
up
He's
in
the
army
now
He's
the
boogie
Woogie
They
made
him
blow
a
bugle
It
really
brought
him
dawn
The
captain
seemed
to
understand
All
right,
boys,
listen
up!
These
fellas
are
the
Red
Tails.
They're
the
guys
who
have
been
First
drink
is
on
me,
fellas.
Hanson,
Travis
J.
Samuel
George.
Me
and
the
boys
over
here
Glad
to
meet
you,
man.
You
flew
with
us
over
Brux.
:
Hey,
have
you
guys
run
into
:
We
haven't
been
that
lucky.
Well,
we've
been
that
unlucky.
Those
babies
go
so
fast

You
know,
we
say
"colored".
But
that's
not
what
you
prefer?
:
No,
no.
The
word
is...
:
"Negro".
When
you
get
upset,
when
you
get
mad,
When
you
get
envious
or
sick,
When
you
become
cowardly,
And
y'all
got
the
nerve


I
want
to
ask
you
an
important
question.
Um...

Will
you
marry
me?


Uh...
Time
to
think.
Oh.
Okay.
MILLER:
When
you
get
Just
run
for
the
woods,
okay?
Go!
Remember,
run
for
the
woods!
:
It's
Ray
Gun,
Any
problems?
:
They
won't
even
know
:
Divide
the
batteries
You've
been
a
great
help,
Ray
Gun.
I
guess
there's
a
lot
more
to
you
coloreds
We
want
you
to
travel
with
us.
Oh,
I
can't.
I'll
stick
out
like
a
pig
I'll
draw
attention
to
you
guys.
Thank
you.
I'll
go
alone.
But...
Here,
take
my
dog
tags.
Get
them
back
to
my
unit.
You're
a
wily
sucker,
Ray.
Good
luck,
Lieutenant.
-
Safe
journey,
Captain.
:
Good
luck.
Remember,
run
for
the
woods.
Okay,
let's
go.


-
:
Run,
Miller,
run!

Halt!
Halt,
halt!

Hat
tamales,
and
they're
red
hot
Hat
tamales,
and
they're
red
hot
I
got
a
girl,
she's
long'
and
tall
Sleeps
in
the
kitchen
Sticks
on
metal
ain't
music.
It
ain't.
I
like
music.
Aww!
Coffee,
or
you
just
get
like
that
with
old
age?
I
once
was
a
happy
man.
That
was
before
you
guys
started
I
could
tolerate
the
P-40s.
But
these
new
babies
getting
beat
up?
Come
on,
Coffee.
I
only
came
back
Uh.
Six.
Six
holes.
Well,
that
ain't
nothing
compared
when
you
run
into
those
jets
I
ain't
afraid
of
no
jets.
Don't
go
trying
your
old
tricks,
If
you
end
up
too
close
the
turbulence
alone
will
blow
Trust
me,
I'm
gonna
be
the
first
one
And
I'll
be
the
second.
My
advice
is,
you
see
one,
run
like
hell.
The
only
thing
in
life
that
makes
me

That's
gonna
get
you
killed
out
there.
The
target
is
a
tank
factory
Shut
that
down,
you
shut
down
Jerry's
General
Campbell's
wing
You
have
recon
on
the
area?
In
the
air,
we're
expecting
everything
A
possibility
of
262's,
-
Jet
fighters?
The
target
area
isn't
your
concern.
The
52nd
will
escort
Is
there
a
reason,
sir?
Sixteen
hundred
miles
to
Berlin
and
back.
With
external
fuel
tanks,
I
guarantee
our
pilots
can.
I'd
prefer
the
Red
Tails
take
the
leg
Our
first
major
air
offensive
over
Berlin.
From
a
propaganda
point
of
view,
a
lot
of
attention
gonna
be
paid
to
this
And
Negro
pilots
Colonel,
A.J.
This
is
coming
from
way
above
me.
If
you
didn't
have
my
respect,
But
we
don't
win
this
war,
all
my
regard,
everything
that
you
none
of
it
means
a
thing.
Colonel.
Please
see
to
it
that
Sir.
You
like
it?
I
wa
nt
you
stay
in
Italia.
You
want
me
to
stay?
Does
that
mean...
Does
that
mean
you'll
marry
me?
Yes.
Marriage.
I
love
you.
I
can't
believe
it.
I'm
getting
married.
Okay,
we're
going
to
throw
it,
all
right?
There
you
go.
All
right.
Throw!

I'm
looking
for
Captain
Julian.
Right
here.
You
the
one
they
call
Easy?
I
guess
some
people
do.
I'm
Captain
Miller.
He
asked
me
to
give
his
tags
to
you.
Four
of
us
got
out.
The
deal
was,
if
we
made
it
and
he
didn't,
Ray
was
a
good
man.
To
whoever
it
matters,
Ray
was
the
best
soldier
I
ever
met.
Thank
you.
A
moment,
Colonel.
What
is
it,
Captain?
:
A
soldier
brought
it
by
today.
They
got
out
from
under
the
Germans,
but
Ray
didn't
make
it.
Sir,
Ray
Gun
wasn't
fit
The
Flight
Surgeon
so,
I
talked
my
way
I
just
don't
feel
like
I'm
fit
I've
made
so
many
mistakes.
No,
you've
made
one
big
mistake.
That
self-pity
of
yours,
But
it
ends
right
here,
right
now.
You
man
up,
you
lead
your
squad.
Every
decision
that
you
make
:
All
right,
this
is
it.
For
the
first
time,
the
bombers
They'll
be
up
against
109s
and
2625,

Unfortunately,
we're
only
going
to
escort
so
I
don't
expect
you'll
see
much
action.
You
will
rendezvous
I
know
this
is
disappointing
to
you.
But
those
are
your
orders.
-
Understood?
Full
briefing
at
0-400.
Spread
the
word,
gentlemen.
Julian.
A
moment.
Captain,
if
your
relief
doesn't
arrive,
If
you
think
you
can
make
it.
Sir.
That
is
all,
son.
:
We're
past
Tail
gunner,
No,
sir.
No
sign
of
them.
Anybody
got
eyes
on
our
relief
fighters?
:
Are
we
going
all
the
way,
sir?
:
Fuel-wise,
But
I'm
guessing
it'll
definitely
be
one
Come
on,
Easy.
it's
Berlin.
Let's
go.
We
can
make
it.
All
right,
gentlemen.
Brace
yourselves.
Yeah!
We
fight!
Ha-ha!
Watch
out,
Hitler,
here
we
come!
Just
remember,
we're
here
Under
all
circumstances,
What's
that
about?
I
think
we've
got
the
Red
Tails
:
By
my
reckoning,
It's
a
little
creepy
Maybe
they
found
out
and
decided
not
to
show
up.
That'd
be
nice.
Wouldn't
mind
that,
would
you,
baby?
Colonel!
it's
from
Mission
Control.
The
52nd
didn't
make
the
rendezvous.
Did
our
boys
turn
back?
No,
sir.
They're
headed
on
to
Berlin.
I
gave
Captain
Julian
the
option.
Headquarters
wants
to
know
Yes,
sir!

Show
no
mercy.
Oh,
shit!
Jets!
We
got
jets!

What
the
hell?
What?
Oh,
no!
Maurice!
Mama!
Break!
Break!
Break!
:
Here
We
go,
Nine
o'clock
low!
I
see
them.
We're
losing
them!
I
got
the
throttle
wide
open!
Son
of
a
bitch!
Those
babies
are
gone.

I'm
losing
power!
Stay
left!
I'll
get
him!
This
is
for
Maurice!

Yeah!
Brilliant!
Smokey,
brilliant!
Easy,
we
got
one
crossing
in
front
of
us.
I
know.
I
got
him.
-
These
jets
ain't
nothing.
Let's
get
some
altitude.

Easy,
right
there!
Ten
o'clock!
I
got
him!
:

Smokey!
Smokey!
I'm
all
right.
I'm
all
right!

I'll
be
damned!
They
missed
me!
No
holes
in
me,
baby!
Whoo!
Come
on.
:
Now
we're
losing
power
That's
it
for
us,
guys.
We
got
a
straggler.
:
Oh,
I
see
him!
I'm
on
it,
Red
One.
Lightning,
form
up.
I'm
going
back.
:
Easy,
you
got
Pretty
Boy
Where?
I
don't
see
him!

Die,
you...
foolish
African!

I'm
heading
right
for
you!
I've
got
him!
I've
got
him!
Get
out
of
my
way!
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Dive
right
now!
Dive.
Whoo!
That's
the
end
of
Pretty
Boy!


Sure
got
him
good!
Ha!
You
did
it!
You
got
that
son
of
a
bitch.
Did
you
say
Lightning
Whoo-hoo!
Give
'em
hell,
Lightning!
You
just
might
be
Now
get
your
ass
back
here
:
We're
an
our
way
back

It
was
a
crazy
move.
I
think
I
did
get
myself
killed.
What
are
you
talking
about?

I
don't
think
What
do
you
mean,
Don't
talk
like
that!
There's
a
lot...
There's
a
lot
of
blood.
Listen
to
me.
Just
hang
in
there.
Just
stay
focus
ed,
I
Tn
gonna
help
you,

I
can't
breathe.
I
can't
breathe.
:
Come
on
now.
We've
gotten
I
screwed
up.
I
screwed
up.
I
don't
care
about
that.
We
can
do
this
together.
Easy.
Gruesome
Twosome.
Lightning!
Lightning,
talk
to
me!
Lightning,
don't
you
do
this
to
me!
Lightning?
Lightning,
look
at
me!
I
love
you.
I'm
sorry,
Sofia.
Lightning,
pull
up!
Lightning,
pop
the
canopy!
Get
out
of
the
plane,
Lightning,
Get
out
of
the
plane!
Damn
you,
Lightning!
Easy.
Easy.

Easy,
do
you
read
me?
Easy!
Stay
on
mission!
Do
you
copy?
We
need
you
back
here.
We
need
you.
For
God's
sake,
I'm
okay.
I'm
on
my
way
down.
Red
One.
Lightning's
with
you,
right?
Lieutenant
Little
is
dead.
Lightning?
Marty?
:
The
expectations
Lieutenant
Little...
exceeded
those
expectations.
We
should
not
be
discouraged
by
his
death,
but
be
all
the
more
encouraged
The
acts
of
bravery
by
him...
will
make
us
stronger.
It
will
inspire
us
to
fight
harder,
to
make
this
world
free.
Because
we
are
on
the
side
Let
us
pray.
Hey!
Hey,
guys!
Hey!
Guys!
I
know
you
didn't
forget
about
me
already!
I've
been
to
hell
and
back,
so
you
will
no
longer
call
me
Junior.
From
now
on
you
will
address
me
:
How'd
you
do
it,
man?
:
I'll
be
damned!

-
Ray!

Boy,
you
look
good.
