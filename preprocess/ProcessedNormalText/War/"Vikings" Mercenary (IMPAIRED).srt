Previously,
on
Vikings...
I
cannot
fight
you.
I
have
no
choice
but
to
leave
you.
I
accept
you
back,
Your
lands
are
lost,
I
always
knew
in
my
heart
Did
you
really
think
that
Earl
Ingstad.
You
and
I
are
not
equals.
We
must
do
battle
Attack!
I
want
you
all
to
know
-
King
Ecbert
sends
you!
King
Ecbert
is
prepared
to
offer
What
about
my
brother?
The
King
will
agree
to
release
Rollo
-
I
accept
the
offer.
-
Will
you
come
back
with
us?
You
have
betrayed
the
gods.

What
is
it
you
wish
to
ask
the
gods?
Will
I
ever
bear
another
child,
I
cannot
see
another
child.
Then...
what
do
you
see?

I
see
a
harvest
celebrated
in
blood.
I
see
a
trickster
I
see
a
city
made
of
marble.
And
a
burning,
broiling
ocean.
Not
one
of
your
prophecies
It
is
the
way
of
prophecy.
Only
to
be
understood
and
it
is
too
late
to
change
it.
When
will
I
die?
Frigg,
the
wife
of
Odin,
But
it
has
not
yet
Come
back
another
day,
and
perhaps
I
may
tell
you
exactly
the
moment
of
your
death.
BJORN:

finally
breaks,

the
land
that
You
know,
that
was
always
my
dream.

I
feel
my
blood
warming!
I
want
to
fight.
I
want
to
raid.
Why
do
you
want
to
fight?
And
what
are
you
fighting
for?
That.

What
do
you
see?
Power.
The
power
of
a
king.
Power
is
always
dangerous.
It
attracts
the
worst.
And
corrupts
the
best.
I
never
asked
for
power.
Power
is
only
given
to
those
who
are

LAGERTHA:
LAGERTHA:
Will
you
come
with
me
to
Wessex?
No,
Earl
Ingstad.
Why
not?
Don't
you
want
to
win
renown?
Of
course
I
do.
But
someone
has
to
remain
and
and
all
of
your
interests
here.
I
believe
you
trust
me
to
do
this.
I
do.
In
this
last
year
you
have
I
have
received
another
Egill
Sokkason
has
proposed
himself.
You
could
do
worse.
He
has
a
good
turf-cutting
business.
At
least
I'd
be
warm
all
winter.

Why
don't
you
offer
You've
made
yourself
I
have
nothing
to
offer
Let
me
be
the
judge
of
that.
People
would
assume
that
I'd
sought
It
would
do
neither
of
us
any
good.
Tell
me
about
Einar.
Einar
still
hates
you.
He
continues
trying
to
to
rise
up
against
you
and
restore
the
old
dynasty.
What
to
do?
I
was
thinking
how
it
will
be
Sailing
across
the
sea
to
England.
We
have
not
talked
about
it
yet.
I
am
not
sure
I
want
you
I
am
ready.
I
have
endured
many
hours
of
training.
Lagertha
herself
even
helped
me.
But
what
if
you
are
with
child
already?
If
I
lost
you,
I
am
coming
with
you!
You
can't
stop
me.
-

Oh...
and
eat
you
for
dinner.
Whoa!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!

-

What
are
you
laughing
at?
Ahh!
-

Please
don't
stop
playing
Oh,
yeah,
we
had
finished.
Oh...
How
is
Boneless?
Ivar
is
what
he
is.
You
know
that.




We
are
such
a
happy
family.
And
what
is
wrong
with
that,
Floki?
Families
are
not
happy.
Name
me
one
family
which
is
happy.
-
Ragnar's.
HELGA:
Yeah,
but
it
makes
me
too
happy,
Helga.
-
You
don't
love
your
daughter?
-
That's
not...
I
feel
trapped,
in
all
this
happiness.
I
feel
trapped,
Helga.
We
do
not
want
to
trap
you,
Floki.
If
you
want
to
leave
us,
You're
too
reasonable,
Helga.
Why
are
you
not
angry
with
me?
Yes,
I
angry
with
you,
Floki.
But
it
doesn't
help
either.
Perhaps
when
you
get
back
Perhaps
I
will
die
in
Wessex.
-
Where
are
you
going?
You're
so
horribly
good,
Helga!

LOTHBROK:

But
you
see
how
he
suffers.

Do
you
even
care?
Yes,
I
care.


Of
course
I
love
him.
Do
you
love
me?

She's
gone.
Now
we
can
talk.
Talk
of
what,
Einar?
Of
betrayal,
of
murder?

LOTHBROK:
And
I
know
what
tortures
you.

But
what
choice
do
you
have?
You
can
neither
hide
I
suffer
from
that
same
dilemma,
only
in
reverse.
We
will
go
together
to
Wessex
and
you
will
be
my
John
the,
um...
-
The
Baptist?
Wherever
you
go,
I
will
follow.
BJORN:
TORSTEIN:
Two
women.
Is
it
possible?

ROLLO:
Hmm?
Take
one
as
a
wife,
-
Concubine?
They
hate
each
other.
They
want
to
kill
each
other.
Please,
just
tell
me,




FLOKI:
You
cannot
understand!
I'm
so
happy
we're
leaving.

ROLLO:
Believe
me,
Floki,
FLOKI:
Always
keep
that
ax
in
your
pants,
if
you
want
to
avoid
troubles.
Well,
some
of
us...

She
wanted
to
come
with
us?
I
could
not
stop
her.
She
reminds
me
-


KALF:
I
want
to
die
with
an
ax
in
my
hand.
As
though
I
had
died
in
battle.
Surely
you
won't
deny
me
that?

You're
joking.
Why
would
a
man
about
to
die
Will
you
give
me
the
ax,
or
not?
Your
gift
was
foolish.
I
don't
think
you'll
use
it
against
me.
Oh,
why
not?
If
you
kill
an
unarmed
man,
then
you
really
are
the
coward
But,
in
any
case,
would
you
really
kill
your
own
Earl?
My
Earl?
Persuade
your
family
and
we
will
get
rid
of
the
woman
What
does
she
do
for
us?
She
goes
raiding
with
Ragnar
Lothbrok.
I
had
no
idea.
And
that
is
the
beauty
of
it.
Ragnar
and
Lagertha...
talk
only
of
farming.
Farming.
Who
wants
to
go
places
and
farm?
Where
is
the
glory
in
that,
Einar?
Where
is
the
glory
in
that?

ECBERT:
I
bid
you
all
welcome.
Earl
Ragnar.
ATHELSTAN:
King
Ragnar
Lothbrok.
What
happened
to
King
Horik?
He
met
with
a,
uh...
unfortunate
accident.
Then
we
are
truly
equal.
It
is
my
pleasure
to
feed
you
What
has
happened
to
our
people
Unfortunately,
the
forces
of
my
uncle
But
if
you,
Ragnar
Lothbrok,
would
join
with
us

ECBERT:

I
have
given
you
land.
Let
me
tell
you
the
truth,
some
of
my
nobles
do
not
They
are
afraid.
But,
I
am
determined
In
return,
some
of
you,
at
least,

That
is
not
part
of
but...
in
good
faith,
and
in
hopes
of
creating
a
long
and
prosperous...
friendship,
I
will
fight.
But
I
cannot
speak
for
the
others.

I
will
fight,
alongside
these
pagans.
For
Mercia.






In
order
to
establish
I
need
the
help
of
one
of
your
leaders.
A
strong
leader.
Someone
that
my
nobles
will
respect.



to
establish
the
settlement
ECBERT:
You
can
speak
for
all
sides.
I
need
you.
I
trust
you
more
than
anyone
else.
I
think
you
should
stay.
Then
I
shall
stay.
Skol!
ECBERT:
-
I...

May
the
gods
go
with
you
Princess.
I
just
wanted
to
wish
you
My
prayers
go
with
you.
Thank
you,
my
lady.
May
I
touch
your
hand?
My
hand?
They
told
me
you
were
crucified.
And
you
still
bear
It's
not
true.
Then
why
not
show
me
your
hand?
I...
It
is
true.
I
bid
you
goodbye,
wife.
Fare
you
well,
husband.
Take
care
of
our
child.
And
wait
patiently
for
my
return.
You
do
not
have
to
come
with
us.
You
can
go
with
Lagertha

I
love
you.
And
I
think
you
are
already
with
child.







Are
you
happy

Since
when
does
any
of
this
have
Tell
me
about
your
uncle.
My
uncle's
name
is
Brihtwulf.
Though
he
calls
himself
He
has
no
right
to
do
so.
He
has
usurped
my
crown.
And
your
younger
brother?
His
name
is
Burgred.
We
were
always
close.
Then
why
does
he
fight
against
you?
My
uncle
has
poisoned
his
mind
or
used
some
magic
against
him.
Magic?
Has
no-one
ever
used
magic
against
you,
Ragnar
Lothbrok?
Think.
A
wife?
A
brother?
A
friend?
I
have
been
deceived
many
times,
but
magic
was
not
the
cause
of
it.

TORSTEIN:
I'd
marry
her
tomorrow.
And
we'd
have
lots
of
children
-

A
creaking
bow,
a
burning
flame...
Tide
on
the
ebb,
The
sons
of
a
king,
an
ailing
calf,
a
witch's
flattery.
No
man
should
be
such
a
fool
FLOKI:
No

To
love

woman

among

for
my

I
