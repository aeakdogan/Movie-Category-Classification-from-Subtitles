RICHARD:
All
of
our
family
mythologies
until
they
become
as
real
WOMAN:
Get
the
door,
Mama.
You
may
be
king,

But
gold
won't
bring
you
happiness
When
you're
growing
old
The
world
still
is
the
same,
WOMAN:
Get
the
damn
door,
Mama.
As
sure
as
the
stars
shine
above
RICHARD:
No
one
in
the
family
can
say
According
to
Grandma,
WOMAN:
Get
the
damn
door,
Mama.
Dad
said
it
started
Seven
miscarriages
in
eight
years
That's
why
my
arrival
on
the
scene

I
was
born
with
the
umbilical
cord
I've
been
pissed
off
ever
since.

The
world
still
is
the
same,
RICHARD:
The
miscarriages
had
taken
that
she
somehow
got
it
in
her
head
Well,
you're
nobody
So
find
yourself
somebody
to
love

RICHARD:
Shortly
after
I
was
born,
my
mother
drove
me
to
California
I
wish
I
could
tell
you
but
the
truth
is,
no
one
knows.
Back
home,
she
claimed
I
had
died
at
birth
What?
Two
years
later,
after
another
miscarriage,
she
suddenly
remembered
Despite
all
of
Mom's
craziness,
But
they
divorced,
and
I
was
passed
around
Eventually,
my
mother
decided
and
that
we
needed
a
fresh
start.
I
disagreed.
-You'll
have
your
own
room.
I'll
get
you
bunk
beds.
But
why
do
I
need
bunk
beds?
It
wasn't
all
bad.
His
name
was
Dell
Fong,
I
identify
him
as
being
Chinese,
because
his
race
Richard,
that's
not
safe.
Maybe
you
can
be
a
cook,
too,
someday.

I
could
never
be
a
cook
like
my
father
because
I'd
already
made
Superhero.
As
a
superhero,
you
occasionally
like
Kryptonite.
My
Kryptonite
was
called
home.
My
mother
had
this
ritual.
Every
year,
she'd
celebrate
the
birthday
by
buying
them
a
birthday
card
That
happened
seven
times
a
year.
I
wouldn't
call
her
successful
at
suicide,
My
dad's
Kryptonite?

"Most
people
go

their
graves
What
was
Mr.
Holmes
saying?
Come
on,
guys,
it's
not
that
hard.
He's
saying
that
most
people
die
without
discovering
their
own
genius,
without
expressing
the
uniqueness
And
that's
what
I
want
you
to
give
me
three
minutes
that
your
classmates
may
not
know.
Mr.
Pimentel,
I
like
your
spirit.
Butt
kisser.
RICHARD:
Funny
how
things
happen.
Only
in
hindsight
do
you
realize
how
can
change
your
entire
life.
Well,
have
any
of
you
ever
eaten
chicken
the
Rickshaw
Gardens
Well,
you
know
the
restaurants
They
buy
dead
ones.
And
you
know
where
they
get
those
I
do,
'cause
I
killed
them.
I've
chopped
the
head
off
chickens
You
find
the
biggest
knife
you
can
find,
then
you
have
to
grab

I
could've
talked
for
hours.

And
I

I
may
not

been

I

Forget
that
superhero
dream,
Mom?
I
forget
whose
birthday
it
was
this
time.
My
mother
ended
up
surviving
It
didn't
matter,
though,
Things
didn't
happen
A
few
years
after
high
school,
I
got
a
job
to
earn
money
for
college.
Richard,
I
need
that
order
10
minutes
ago.
I
still
had
my
dream,
Bambi
was
a
visual
effect
by
my
first
viewing
of
Star
Wars.
Tiff,
you're
exposed.
What
are
you
working
on?
There's
a
tournament
and
it's
open
to
anybody.
So
I
figured
if
I
went
there
and
who
knows,
maybe
a
scholarship.
No
shit.
-What
are
you
gonna
wear?
Oh,
honey,
no
way.
You
see
that
guy
over
there?
Girls.
Did
you
hear
about
the
midnight
rambler?
Everybody
got
to
go
Did
you
hear
about
the
midnight
rambler?
MAN:
Well
done.
RICHARD:
Yeah,
thank
you,
sir.
Hey.
Mr.
Pimentel?
I'm
Ben
Padrow
with
the
University.
Hi,
Dr.
Padrow,
I
know
who
you
are.
Well,
congratulations.
I'm
impressed.
Nice
suit.
Oh,
thank
you
very
much.
Where
do
you
go
to
school?
Actually,
sir,
I'm
not
in
school
right
now.
I'm
a
little
strapped
financially.
Well,
we
have
scholarships
Come
see
me.
Yes,
sir.

You're
late.
I'm
sorry.
I
was
over
at
the
admissions...
No
time
for
apologies.
I
picked
three
speeches,
like
you
asked.
The
good
one.
Tick,
tock.
Come
on.
All
right.
Last
meal's
been
eaten.
Last
prayer
has
been
said.

Just
sit
down
there,
please.
Right
here.
You
like
it
up
there?
Yeah,
l...
I
like
it
better
than
anything.
Why?
I
don't
know.
Stop
right
there.
That's
the
first
honest
thing
you've
said,
You
don't
know
why
you're
up
there.
Sure,
you're
talented
and
passionate.
You
could
fool
some
blue-haired
judge
This
is
another
league.
Wait
a
minute,
l...
I've
won
every
single
tournament
You
didn't
think
that
I
was
good?
I
think
you're
the
most
gifted,
and
you
have
incredible
potential.
And
you
are
completely
full
of
shit.
Hold
on,
wait
a
minute.
So
that's
it?
I've
been
working
towards
this
I'm
not
asking...
It
doesn't
have
to
be
Look,
my
advice?
You're
not
ready.
Go
live
a
life.
Fill
yourself
up.
Find
out
what's
important,
-l...
Earn
a
point
of
view.
Then
come
back
RICHARD:
"Get
a
life,
"
my
ass.
I
had
a
life,
and
there
was
no
way
Fortunately,
the
government
where
you
could
gain
valuable
They
would
guarantee
your
education
It
was
called
Vietnam.
Now
my
girl
you're
so
young
and
pretty
And
one
thing
I
know
is
true
My
reaction
may
have
been
a
bit
hasty.
After
six
months
in
country,
Watch
my
daddy
in
bed
a-dyin'
Watched
his
hair
been
turnin'
grey
He's
been
workin'
and
slavin'
his
life
away
Oh,
yes,
I
know
it
Yeah
-He's
been
workin'
so
hard
-I've
been
workin'
too,
baby
Every
night
and
day
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
We
gotta
get
out
of
this
place
If
it's
the
last
thing
we
ever
do
We
gotta
get
out
of
this
place
'Cause
girl,
there's
a
better
life

So
we're
gonna
move
off
this
hill
I
need
four
volunteers
to
stay
behind.
I
always
wanted
to
be
a
hero.
All
right,
there
we
go.
I
need
three
more.
Watch
my
daddy
in
bed
a-dyin'
-Yeah
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
We
gotta
get
out
of
this
place
If
it's
the
last
thing
we
ever
do
Sector
One.
Sector
One.
We
need
help!
Let's
move!
We're
out.
Let's
go.
We're
out.
What
you
did
out
there
took
courage.
I
just
wanted
you
to
understand
I
got
something
planned
for
you
while
you're
right
here
in
Vietnam.
Carry
on.
Come
here,
sister
Papa's
in
the
swing
Oh,
the
mother
lode.

Who
needs
a
medal,
huh?
I
don't
want
a
medal,
man.
He
ain't
no
drag
To
surviving
the
surviving.
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag
Come
here,
mama
And
dig
this
crazy
scene
He's
not
too
fancy
But
his
line
is
pretty
clean

He
ain't
no
drag
Bring
it
on,
gooks.
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag

Incoming!


Richard!
Point
to
where
it
hurts.

You
got
tinnitus.
It's
ringing
in
the
ears.
I
can't
hear
you.


You're
lucky.
Your
friends
lost
theirs
completely.
If
I'm
deaf,
You
lost
your
upper
register,
By
the
time
you
can
hear
the
low
sounds
will
be
so
loud,
Can
you
just
make
the
noise
stop?
I
can't.
That's
tinnitus.
Some
days
will
be
better
than
others,
Ever.



RICHARD:
This
is
my
letter
of
acceptance
And
I
also
brought
No,
no,
I
can't
authorize
this.
I'm
sorry.
Could
you
speak
up
Thank
you.
I
can't
authorize
government
funds
Why?
You're
deaf.
I'm
what?
It's
a
deaf
joke.
You're
worse
than
deaf,
you're
confused.
You
can
hear
only
vowels,
no
consonants.
Yeah.
Well,
if
you
can
only
hear
vowels,
learn
to
read
lips
or
move
to
Hawaii.

I
don't
wanna
go
to
Hawaii,
Listen,
even
if
you
graduate,
Why?
'Cause
I'm
deaf?
Helen
Keller
was
deaf
and
blind.
-No.
No,
because
of
the
ringing.
-Night
and
day,
right?
-In
both
ears?
You
won't
be
able
to
concentrate.
You
won't
have
any
friends.
You'll
be
incompetent
No
shit?
You
know
what?
You
got
a
desk
and
a
clipboard.
'Cause
if
you
did,
you'd
know
and
shoving
that
clipboard
I'm
gonna
go
to
college,
and
I'm
gonna
and
you
can
stick
that
MIKE:
You
ungrateful
piece
of
shit!
Get
your
hands
off
me,
bro!
-Don't
touch
me.
-MIKE:
Don't
fucking
touch
me.
Hey,
bro,
could
you
hold
it
a
sec?
-Yeah.
MAN
1:
What
the
hell's
wrong
with
you?
Thanks,
man.
Damn
thing
only
lights
half
the
time.
Hell,
I
only
work
half
the
time
myself.
You
don't
say
much.
Got
a
light?
Buddy,
you
got
a
light?
Hey,
man,
you
deaf?
Yeah,
I
am.
I
heard
that.
I
lost
a
wheel.
Fucking
peaceniks.
I'd
hate
them
a
lot
more
You
wanna
get
a
beer?
What?
A
beer.
A
brew.
Cold
one.
It's
10:00
in
the
morning,
man.
So?

No,
no
thanks.
Mike
Stolz.
Mike.
Richard.
Like
Nixon?

That's
awesome.
Here
you
go,
bro.
That
shit's
good
for
you.

MIKE:
They
overran
us.
Swarmed
us,
bro.
And
it's
just
me
and
Jimmy
left,
I'm
fucking
gone.
Fuck
Jimmy,
bro.
And
I
fucking
stand
to
run,
and
Jimmy
pulls
me
down
I
never
saw
him.
Jimmy
saved
my
life.
Then
I
look
over,
tell
him,
"Let's
go,
bro."
And
Jimmy's
head
was
just
gone.


Motherfuckers!
He
saved
my
life.
And
God
forgive
me,
bro,
What
the
fuck,
man?

Look
at
this
shit.
Clearly,
Kesey's
expressing
Yeah,
he's
celebrating
the
individual,
but
I
think
it's
more
about

The
individual
is
disengaged
I
think
it's
more
about
the
abuse
of
power.
As
a
result,
he
acts
...authority
figure,
right?
I...
I
forgot
something.
Hey,
watch
it.

PADROW:
You
come
by
anytime.
-Thanks,
Dr.
Padrow.



Look
like
you
have
a
coke
problem.
May
l?
I...
I
don't...
Yeah,
don't
bother,
all
right?
I'm
deaf.
I
can
read
lips,
but
not
that
well.
You're
welcome.

All
right.
Damn
boy
scout.
You
think
you're
too
good
to
talk
to
me?
Wait
a
minute,
I
understood
that.
You
want
a
fucking
medal?
No,
I
wanna
hug
you.
How
about
I
shake
your
hand?
Richard.
Art.
You
better
wash
your
hands.
This
may
be
contagious.

You
wanna
sit
down,
Einstein?
Yeah,
sure.
You
wanna...
RICHARD:
The
only
person
on
the
planet
was
a
wickedly
obscene
genius
And
the
only
person
that
could
We
were
like
a
traveling
freak
show.
How
old
is
that
chair,
anyway?
I
saw
tanks
in
Nam
No.
Why
the
hell
would
I
need
a
new
one?
There's
nowhere
for
me
to
go.
Hey,
watch
it!
Oh,
sorry.
Can't
you
go
forward
in
that
thing?
Yeah,
sure,
if
you
blow
me.
What?
What's
so
funny?
What'd
she
say?
Oh,
she
just
wants
to
blow
me.
What
did
that
spaz
say?
Art
is
what
I'm
called.
Support
Art
and
blow
me.
He
said
he's
very,
very
sorry,
-Yeah,
right.
Oh,
and
blow
him.

This
reminds
me
of
my
childhood.
You
used
to
skate?
I
used
to
sit
here
with
the
grandmas
and
watch
everyone
else
skate.

Times
they
are
a-changing.
Yeah.
Are
you
a
good
skater?
Oh,
hell
no.
It's
your
thing
Oh,
yeah.
I
can't
tell
you
Who
to
sock
it
to
It's
your
thing
Do
what
you
wanna
do
I
can't
tell
you
Who
to
sock
it
to
If
you
want
me
to
love
you
Maybe
I
will
I
need
you
woman,
it
ain't
no
big
deal
Go
faster,
go
faster.
You
need
love
now,
just
as
bad
as
I
do
Make's
me
no
difference
now
Who
you
give
your
thing
to
Oh,
it's
your
thing

Do
what
you
wanna
do
-Whoa,
watch
it.
Art!
Honeyman,
stop!

I
can't
tell
if
he's
hurt
or
not.
Art,
are
you
okay?
I
was
kicking
ass
She's
dangerous.
You
okay?
-Yeah,
next
time
use
a
blinker.

Wait
here.
You're
a
lousy
date.
Are
you
listening
to
me?
You
wanna
repeat
that
to
my
face?
-What?
-What?
No,
I
didn't,
actually,
I'm
deaf.
But
I
can
see
Hey,
easy,
tiger.
First
of
all,
you're
eavesdropping
Secondly,
I
can
say
whatever
I
want.
Yeah?
So
can
l.
You're
an
asshole.
My
friend
is
not
a
retard.
Actually,
he's
probably
smarter
He's
certainly
smarter
than
you.
He's
got
cerebral
palsy.
It
means
that
his
brain
while
his
body
is
more
or
less
useless.
If
you
have
a
little
trouble
think
of
it
as
the
opposite
of
you.
Asshole.
Who
the
hell
is
this
guy?
I'm
sorry
about
my
friend.
Yeah,
I'm
sorry
for
you,
he's
a
jerk.
Sometimes.
You
didn't
have
to
threaten
him.
What'd
she
say?
She
said
you're
a
dick.
Oh.
You
know
what,
why
don't
you
The
two
of
you
deserve
each
other.
What
is
your
problem?
RICHARD:
You
believe
that?
She's
a
fox.
You
should've
asked
her
out.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Actually,
she
said
you
were
immature.
What?
How
come
you
said
"dick"?
Because
it
was
funnier.
Sunshine
came
softly
Could've
tripped
out
easy
It'll
take
time,
I
know
it

Oh.
You.
Yeah,
remember
me?
Immature
guy.
Yeah.
I
got
class.
Oh,
I'll
walk
you.
No,
thanks.
You're
going
to
be
mine
I'll
tell
you
right
now
Any
trick
in
the
book
now,
baby
All
that
I
can
find
It's
sold
out.
We'll
figure
that
out.
What
if
that
guy's
coming?
Then
the
two
of
you
can
hold
hands.
Okay,
here
she
comes.
No.
You're
Richard?
Oh,
my
God,
this
is
so
trippy.
Where's
your
friend?
He's
not
coming?
Nikos?
Nah.
Aw,
man.
I
don't
think
this
is
a
good
idea.
Come
on.
You
need
the
gas
money,
Look,
come
on,
I'll
be
nice.
Yeah,
well,
if
you're
mean,
I'll
leave
you.
All
right,
that
sounds
fair.
-Art
thinks
that's
fair.
I
like
to
dream
Yes,
yes,
right
between
my
sound
machine
On
a
cloud
of
sound
I
drift
in
the
night
Any
place
it
goes
is
right
Goes
far,
flies
near,
Well,
you
don't
know
what
we
can
find
Why
don't
you
come
with
me,
little
girl
On
a
magic
carpet
ride
You
don't
know
what
we
can
see
Why
don't
you
tell
your
dreams
to
me
Fantasy
will
set
you
free
Are
you
guys
coming?
Yeah,
we'll
be
right
in.
RICHARD:
Pardon
me.
Hi.
You
better
not
molest
me
back
here.

I
have
a
plan.
Bite
me.
Do
what?

Oh,
my
God,
he's
got
me!
Help!
Help!
For
the
love
of
God,
No,
no,
he's
contagious.
He'll
get
you,
too.
Go,
go
get
help.
Hurry!


And
all
the
joy
within
you
dies
You
didn't
have
a
ticket,
did
you?
RICHARD:
Sorry?
You
didn't
have
a
ticket,
did
you?
Don't
you
need
somebody
to
love?
Wouldn't
you
love
somebody
to
love?
Hey,
hey.
I
really
can't
see
You
better
find
somebody
to
love
GIRL
1:
Hey!
GIRL
2:
That
is
so
uncool.
Yes,
and
your
mind
Better?
Your
mind
is
so
full
of
red
Don't
you
want
somebody
to
love?
Don't
you
need
somebody
to
love?


You
knew
it
was
me,
didn't
you?
All
my
signs
disappeared
off
the
campus

I
like
that.
I
need
to
shower.

You
know,
I
just
can't
stop
Jesus
Christ!
Hey,
morning,
Tarzan.
I'd
invite
you
in,
but
I
don't
think
-Hey,
babe.
Uh-huh.
What,
do
you
guys,
like,
live
together?
-Yeah.
What,
are
you
guys,
like,
friends
or
what?
We
have
an
open
relationship.
You
look
a
little
confused,
man.
You
just
spent
the
night
with
me
I'm
not
confining
myself.
So
are
you
trying
to
get
back
at
me?
No,
Richard,
this
is
my
life.
We
had
fun
last
night,
right?
Yeah,
I
like
you.
I
like
you
a
lot.
I
can't
handle
this
shit.
Richard?
Richard,
I
know
you
hear
me.
Look,
I
guess
I
should've
warned
you.
Maybe
before
I
looked
in
the
shower.
Well,
let's
just
have
fun.
I
mean,
I
think
what
we
have
Look,
I
like
to
have
fun,
too,
No,
that's...
Wrong
guy.
You're
old-fashioned.
That's
cute.
Am
I
going
to
see
you
again?
Hmm?
Okay.
Here's
how
this
works.
If
you're
with
me,
I
don't
wanna
hear
about
him,
I
don't
wanna
smell
him.
That's
fair.
Well,
I
don't
know
why
I
came
here
tonight
I
got
the
feeling
that
something
ain't
right
I'm
so
scared
in
case
I
fall
off
my
chair
And
I'm
wondering
Pass
the
towel,
baby.
Clowns
to
the
left
of
me
Here
I
am
Yes,
I'm
stuck
in
the
middle
with
you
And
I'm
wondering
what
it
is
I
should
do
It's
so
hard
to
keep
this
smile
from
my
face
Losing
control,
yeah,
I'm
all
over
the
place
Clowns
to
the
left
of
me
Here
I
am
Well,
you
started
out
with
nothing
And
you're
proud
Please
Please
MAN:
Your
grades
are
excellent.
You're
a
decorated
veteran.
You
mind
telling
me
I
don't
usually
divulge
that
information
So
what
do
you
wanna
do
I
wanna
help
people.
Yeah!
RICHARD:
After
graduation,
and
got
a
great
job
They
had
no
idea
I
was
deaf.

Right
here.
Careful.
MAN:
Where
do
you
want
this?
Yeah,
right...
Over
here.
Hey.
-What
do
you
think?
MIKE:
Nobody's
asking
for
handouts,
man.
All
these
cats
here,
They
just
need
somebody
Some
buttoned-down
asshole
who's
Somebody
with
a
job,
bro.
Yeah,
somebody
like
me.
Good
idea,
bro.
I
will
give
you
those
things
Follow
me
now
and
you
will
not
regret
New
shirt?

Baby,
the
phone.
Hello?
Wait,
whose
birthday?
They
better
be
Forget
it,
I'm
not
hungry
anymore.
Oh,
that's
funny.
-You
know
what
else
is
funny?
A
guy
with
CP

Hey,
buddy,
can
you
hold
that
for...
Thank
you,
appreciate
that.
Hi.
Just
here.
Yes,
your
highness.
-You
want
your
coat
on
or
off?
Okay.
All
right.
RICHARD:
You
need
a
menu?
No,
no.
I...
I
know
what
I
want.
Good
evening.
I
mean,
good
morning.
Hi.
Hey,
we'll
just
have
the
pancakes.
Yeah.
Actually,
my
manager
-You
can't
serve
pancakes?
They
got
them.
Look,
I
don't
want
to
sound
rude...
No,
no,
no.
You're
not
rude,
it's...

I'm
trying
my
damnedest
Good.
I
don't
feel
there
is
one.
I
think
you
two
need
to
leave.
You're
making
the
other
customers
Oh.
Why?
Hey,
we
can
refuse
to
serve
You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
It's
my
friend's
birthday.
I...
I
think
she
needs
some
hot
man
love.
Maybe.
I'll
ask
her,

Okay,
don't
you
dare.
You
are
the
ugliest,
I
thought
people
like
you
died
at
birth.
How
do
you
expect
people
Normal
people
Listen,
lady.
I'm
sorry
if
I'm
doing
your
job
for
you.
He
says
he's
very
sorry
-That's
obviously
your
job.
Okay,
you
know
what?
ART:
Oh,
oh,
wait.
Call
them.
RICHARD:
That
night
we
were
arrested
for
This
law
made
it
a
crime
who
was
diseased,
so
as
to
be

Hey,
hey,

RICHARD:
That
horrible
waitress
I'd
been
trying
to
hide
from
my
past.
I
quit
my
nice,
high-paying
job
Me.
RICHARD:
I
cold-called
every
business
I
wouldn't
take
no
for
an
answer.
and
in
the
process,
DOCTOR:
All
right,
Richard,
WOMAN
ON
PA:
Dr.
Collins,

Dr.
Collins,
please
call
extension
21-10.
RICHARD:
At
that
time,
the
only
people
so
I
got
a
job
at
a
government
agency
What
is
it
that
you're
afraid
of,
that
he
can't
work
with
you,
You
had
to
stop
As
soon
as
I
was
hired,
Nothing
tickled
him
more
than
trying
to
tear
down
a
system
Mike
was
a
natural
headhunter.
MIKE:
I'm
like
Chinese
water
torture,
lady.
I'm
gonna
keep
calling
you
back
Listen,
lady,
listen
to
me.
I
left
my
leg
in
a
rice
paddy.
I
get
a
big,
fat
check
every
month.
I
don't
need
to
be
But
they
need
me.
And
they
need
to
give
them
a
freaking
chance
What?
Yeah?
Well,
amen,
sister.
Listen,
maybe
you
and
l
All
right,
maybe
not.
All
right,
take
care.
RICHARD:
The
word
was
out.
I
could
find
jobs
for
any
disabled
person,
She's
a
file
clerk
and
she
hasn't
missed
-MAN:
Sounds
good.
-Can
she
start
tomorrow?
-A
what?
How
the
hell
can
a
dwarf
be
a
file
clerk?
She
specializes
in
L
through
Z.
-I
have
a
step
stool,
stupid.
-Okay,
I'll
give
her
a
shot.
-Have
her
come
in
tomorrow.
Hello?
Is
this
the
Governor's
office?
Yeah,
well,
this
is
Richard
Pimentel.
Okay.
Hello.
Yes,
sir.
Well...
Thank
you,
sir.
'Cause
you're
an
ungrateful
piece
of
shit.
What
kind
of
offer?
MIKE:
What?
What?
You
wanna
fucking
take
me
on?
Yeah,
I
would
love
MIKE:
I
don't
give
a
shit,
man.
Okay.
Thank
you
very
much.
Listen,
bro,
how
about
and
I
beat
you
to
death
What?
When?
You
can
start
tomorrow?
He'll
be
there.
Hey,
bro,
listen,
you're
doing
Don't
fuck
it
up.
-To
our
future.
So,
when
the
Governor's
office
Whoa.
Excuse
me?
I
guess
his
office
I
don't
remember
the
exact
words,
-But
you
don't
remember?
Anyway,
the
upshot
is
they
want
me
to
create
a
program
to
train
employers
to
hire
-Seriously?
Honey,
that's
amazing.
What
were
they
doing
before?
There
is
no
before.
-I'd
be
starting
from
scratch.
You
heard
about
this
for
a
week
Well,
I
didn't
know
And
the
bad
news
is
But
the
good
news
is,
they
wanna
send
me
around
So
the
good
news
is
you'll
be
traveling?
Yeah.
If
you
want
to,
What's
wrong?
I
just...
Nothing.
Nothing.
Well,
come
on,
you
seem
bummed.
I'm
not
bummed.
It's...
It's
just
that
I
hardly
see
you
now
as
it
is,
so
what's
it
going
to
be
like
No,
no.
This...
Look,
When
I'm
in
town,
I'm
gonna
be
at
home.
I've
been
working
a
lot
lately
This
is
a
really
big
deal.
I
know.
Okay.
I'm
proud
of
you.
So
when
are
you
gonna
tell
Mike
Mike's
the
hardest
worker
you
got,
okay?
He's
a
ticking
time
bomb.
He's
effective.
He's
completely
out
of
control.
What
happens
when
you're
not
here
As
it
is,
no
one
wants
to
work
with
him.
The
people
that
he
got
work
for
Look,
I'll
talk
to
him.
This
job
is
his
life.
I
don't
care.
I
want
him
gone.
I'm
on
time,
bro.
I'm
never
late.
I
wear
nice
clothes.
Who's
placed
more
people
than
me,
No
doubt,
I
know.
You
got
an
unorthodox
style,
man.
So
when
are
you
leaving,
man?
I
go
in
a
week.
Fucking
A,
brother.
You're
gonna
be
great.
Thanks.
Look,
man,
I
don't
have
to
do
this
No,
don't
worry
about
me.
I'm
a
survivor,
brother.
I'm
gonna
be
fine.
Yeah.
Sometimes
late
when
things
are
real
And
people
share
the
gift
of
gab
Some
are
quick
to
take
the
bait
And
catch
the
perfect
prize
RICHARD:
They
wanted
me
to
write
I
finally
had
something
to
say,
But
oz
never
did
give
nothing
That
he
didn't,
didn't
already
have
And
cause
never
was
the
reason
Come
on,
guys.
Has
he
told
you
yet
you're
full
of
shit?
'Cause
if
you're
any
good
he
will,
trust
me.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
best
student
I
never
had.
That's
all
for
today,
thank
you.
Tilting
at
Windmills.
You
a
Quixote
fan?
Yeah.
I
was
reading
it
one
night
You
know,
the
hardest
thing
is
the
way
that
other
people
treat
you.
Employers,
they
don't
wanna
Why
is
that?
They
lack
confidence
in
us.
-I
think
you
may
have
that
wrong.
You
don't
need
to
change
their
minds
you
need
to
change
their
minds
I
wanna
show
you
something.
-Lithium?
I'm
what
they
call
a
manic-depressive.
That
medicine
you're
holding
I
don't
share
that
with
a
lot
of
people.
For
years,
The
day
you
auditioned
for
me
No,
I
got
a
life
'cause
of
you.
-You
could've
lost
it
because
of
me.
I
lost
my
hearing.
I
gained
a
superpower,
lip-reading.
I
can
spy
on
conversations
I
could
have
some
fun
with
that
-So
you
don't
wear
hearing
aids?
I
get
them
from
the
government,
but
I
just
Do
me
a
favor,
-Richard?
Bill
Austin.
Come
on
back
with
me.
-Right
in
here,
please.
No
offense,
I'm
just
here
to
humor
Ben.
See,
I
have
this
ritual
with
Uncle
Sam
how
much
more
deaf
I
am
and
then
I
cash
his
disability
checks.
Well,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
in
living
a
life
with
a
hearing
problem
Wait,
wait.
I'm
going
to
stick
it
in
your
ear,
unless
you
have
another
place
Ear's
good.
Now
we're
ready
to
try
Is
that
them?
They're
like
a
contact
lens
for
the
ear.

We've
found
that
We
get
a
more
efficient
coupling

Can
you
hear
me,
Richard?
How
does
it
sound?
Can
you
hear
me?


Can
you
hear
me?

Oh,
yeah.
That's
great.
Wash
away
my
troubles
With
the
rain
in
Shambala
Wash
away
my
sorrow
RICHARD:
Once
I
started
writing
again,
My
central
focus
was
about
persons
with
all
disabilities.
It
took
me
a
year
to
write.
Ah,
ooh,
yeah
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Everyone
is
helpful
On
the
road
to
Shambala
Everyone
is
lucky
On
the
road
to
Shambala
What
page
are
you
on
right
now?
I'm
on
page
shut
the
fuck
up.
I've
got
CP,
I'm
not
deaf.
All
right,
come
in.
Come
on,
man.
Say
something.
Why
did
you
want
me
to
read
this?
'Cause
I
don't
think
But
I
never
would've
written
that
Now,
you're
the
smartest
guy
that
I
know,
and
if
you
don't
think
that's
any
good,
You
don't
have
a
clue...
-All
right,
shit.
You
don't
have
a
clue
how
good
this
is.
You
know
what
we
cripples
want
besides
getting
laid?
To
be
seen.
When
they
look
at
me
out
there
now,
you
know
what
they
see?
Nothing.
I'm
ignored.
How
can
you
ignore
this?
But
they
ignore
me,
because
I
am
so
disturbing
to
their
definition
of
human,
that
I
make
them
feel.
I
love
that.
What
you've
created
will
help
to
make
them
see
us.
If
you
try
to
tear
this
up,
I'll
kick
your
ass.
All
right.

RICHARD:
I
threw
myself
into
my
career.
I
was
changing
lives
and
ignoring
my
own.
I
was
keynote
speaker
for
CIA,
NASA,
the
VA,
all
of
them.
My
own
subversive
little
goal
into
the
biggest
employer
Mike
would've
dug
the
irony.
Richard,
we
made
plans
Why
did
you
wait
till
now
-I
just
forgot
all
about
it.
I'm
sorry.
It's
an
important
conference,
I
can't
just
not
show
up,
And
I
don't?
They're
strangers
at
a
convention,
They
applaud,
you
eat
it
up.
So
I
have
to
wonder,
I'm
doing
it
for
them
We'll
do
something
special
Okay?
Richard,
this
is
important
to
me.
Stop
it!
I
am
not
doing
this
right
now.
I'll
call
you
from
the
hotel.
Until
you've
seen
You
stand
at
the
edge
And
I
thank
the
lord
There's
people
out
there
like
you
I
thank
the
lord
There's
people
out
there
like
you
While
Mona
Lisas
and
mad
hatters
Sons
of
bankers,
sons
of
lawyers
Turn
around
and
say
good
morning
For
unless
they
see
the
sky
Hey,
baby,
it's
me.
RICHARD:
Hello?
Just
wanna
say
that
today
went
really
well
and
I
wanted
to
see
how
you
were
doing
and
tell
you
that
I
miss
you
a
lot.
And...
Pick
up
if
you're
there

I
think
I
messed
up.
Christine?
Christine?

Oh,
boy.
The
minute
I
turn
my
back,
You
just
don't
get
it,
do
you?
Just
go
get
Christine
It's
okay,
Nikos.
You've
been
seeing
him
behind
my
back?
No.
I'm
just
here
until
I
find
my
own
place.
I'm
not
getting
back
with
Nikos.
-Does
he
know
that?
You
two
sleeping
-Jesus.
You
don't
get
it.
I
just
want
you
to
come
home.
-I'm
not
coming
home.
Is
this
because
No,
it's
because
I've
always
depended
on
men
like
you
to
make
me
feel
better
I
need
to
be
on
my
own.
All
right,
well,
be
on
your
own.
I
mean,
I'm
traveling,
I'm
flailing
here,
okay?
-I
love
you.
I
wanna
be
with
you.
You
just
wanna
win
me
and
put
me
That's
not
a
relationship,
Richard,
I
need
to
figure
out
who
I
am
and...
And
I
think
you
need
to
figure
out
WOMAN:
Margaret,
you
have
a
visitor.
Hi,
Mom.
How
you
feeling?
The
doctors
tell
me
I'm
doing
well.
But
I
don't
feel
like
it,
and
neither
do
l.

Schizophrenia
humor.
That's
good,
Mom.
You
know
what
I
miss?
Dancing.
You
know
who
was
a
good
dancer?
Not
really.
He
took
foxtrot,
cha-cha,
tango
lessons.
I
used
to
take
him
to
the
nightclubs.
Oh,
we
had
so
much
fun.
No,
Mom,
actually,
I
didn't.
No
12-year-old
boy
That's
a
lie.
-Why'd
you
do
it
for
two
years?
I
wanna
take
a
nap
now.
-But
your
son
came
so
far
to
visit
you.
That's
all
right.
That's
okay,
it's
fine.
Here,
I
wanna
give
you
something.
This
is
a
new
standard
for
disability
and
I
wrote
it.
I
don't
feel
like
reading
anything.
Well,
I
just
wanna
tell
you,
Mom,
I
love
my
job,
I'm
making
a
difference.
What
do
you
want?
You
want
me
to
pat
your
hand,
I'm
not
wired
that
way.
RICHARD:
The
average
able-bodied
person
Would
we
care
about
women's
rights
We're
not
gonna
care
about
until
they
set
aside
their
differences,
and
come
together
That
would
be
the
Americans
Yes,
exactly,
This
bill,
simply
put,
says
that
simply
because
they
don't
look
like
you.
Okay.
Why
don't
we
hold
that
thought
Now
that
the
election
I
have
it
on
very
good
authority
that
the
very
first
candidate
who
is
gonna
get
the
disabled
vote.
Everybody,
which
is
that
has
the
balls
-Richard,
please,
just...
Rumor
has
it
that
one
of
our
senior
okay,
"Sir,
we
have
a
problem.
"There
is
a
horrific
disease.
"It
is
infecting
homosexuals
"and
it
is
always
fatal."
And
you
know
what
he
said?
He
said,
That
is
the
kind
of
Nazi
Germany
here
in
America,
in
the
late
20th
century.
That's
it.
We're
off
the
air,
all
right?
RICHARD:
Somewhere
along
the
way
My
anger
was.
I
think
Art
noticed
it
first.
You're
a
complete
asshole.
You
used
to
be
a
partial
one,
How
the
hell
did
you
get
in
here?
When
you're
not
looking,
I
can
walk.
So
you're
too
busy
Too
deaf
to
hear
the
phone
ring?
You
know
what?
and
try
and
guilt-trip
me,
all
right?
I
do.
The
CIA,
man.
Fucking
CIA.
I'm
doing
great.
But
you
don't
look
great.
Yeah?
Well,
who's
this?


Who's
this?

MIKE:
Hey,
Mr.
Hot
Shit
Phone
Recorder.
I
feel
like
an
asshole
talking
to
this
thing.
Listen
man,
Hey,
bro,
let
me
ask
you
something.
You
remember
what
it
felt
like
Mike.
Like
you
had
survived
hell
and
from
'cause
just
being
alive
was
a
blessing,
and
you
had
your
whole
life
ahead
of
you.
Fuck
it.
I
tried.
Later,
bro.
Mike.
Mike.
Hey.
Shit.
I'm
gonna
do
whatever
it
takes
to
make
sure
the
disabled
For
too
long
they've
been
left
out,
but
they're
not
going
to
be


It's
Bush.
Bush,
Bush,
Bush.
If
Bush
wins,
you
know
what
that
means?
That
means
I'm
gonna
have
to
just
to
service
these
retards.
You
know
what
that's
gonna
cost
me?
No,
what's
it
gonna
cost
you?
I'm
just
talking
about
Yeah,
what's
it
gonna
cost
you?
It
means
I
have
to
put
in
ramps,
It's
gonna
wind
up...
Right.
You
might
have
to
spend,
what,
and
widen
a
toilet
stall
Sir...
I
don't
mean
anything
by
it,
all
right...
Yeah,
you
do.
I
lost
my
hearing
in
the
war.
You
wanna
talk
about
Tell
you
what,
go
ahead.
I
won't
listen.
Say
something
funny.
Tell
him.
Why
don't
you
tell
him
a
joke
but
he
a
has
a
brain
disorder
Huh?
Or
a
world-class
skier
who
breaks
her
neck
That's
funny
stuff.
And
poor
you,
'cause
now
you
gotta
into
this
piece-of-shit
restaurant.
You
know
what?
Here
you
go.
Sorry
for
the
inconvenience.
Richard?
Richard,
it's
me.
Hey,
Christine.
It's
been
a
while.
How
are
you?
Good,
yeah,
I'm
just...
So
are
you
still
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's
good,
-it's
going
really
well.
The
same
old
Art.
Is
that
your
husband?
No.
No?
You
know,
it's
strange
to
see
you.
I
was
thinking
about
you
Thinking
about
you
a
lot,
actually.
I
was
remembering
the
trip
to
Seattle.
I'm
engaged.
He's
my
fianc.
Well,
is
it
hot
in
here
-Richard...
Well,
I'm
gonna
go.
Are
you
okay?
Yeah,
absolutely.
He's
just
an
old
friend.

WOMAN:
Mr.
Pimentel,
it
is
urgent
that
you



MIKE:

I'm
right
here,
man.

CHRISTINE:
Richard,
open
the
door!
-Hey.
What
are
you
doing,
Richard?
Why
would
you
do
that?
She
died.
My
mother
finally
died.

It's
okay.
It's
hot.
I
feel
like
an
idiot.
All
the
shit
I've
dealt
with,
is
I
can't
get
some
mentally
ill
woman
Well,
that's
not
your
fault.
And
she
missed
being
close
What
are
you
doing
here,
anyway?
I
was
worried
about
you.
If
not
for
you,
I
wouldn't
be
I
don't
think
that's
a
compliment.
No,
it
is,
it
is.
I
learned
a
lot
from
you.
I
never
told
you
how
glad
I
am
RICHARD:
So
after
spending
my
whole
life
to
someone
that
was
not
capable
I
finally
realized
I
actually
had
something
that
neither
of
us
much
cared
But
I
didn't
like
that.
So
I
did
what
she
could
never
do.
I
accepted
myself.
Two
years
ago,
the
Americans
with
Disabilities
Act
And
last
week
it
became
a
reality.
Congratulations.
You
did
that.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Parks,
would
say
Now
does
that
mean
that
Although,
I
do
like
to
wear
spandex

The
differences
that
you
make
they're
the
little
differences
that
And
all
of
these
people
they
all
made
a
difference
in
my
life,
and
I
can
only
hope
that
somehow
And
that
after
years
and
years
and
years
I'm
now
working
on
maybe
Hey,
you're
late.
Blow
me,
Ironsides.
ART:
Last
one
in
pays.
All
right,
easy
there,
Andretti.
Come
on,
cowboy.
WAITRESS:
Two?
Follow
me.
Is
this
one
okay?
Yeah,
if
you're
big
tippers.
He's
paying,
But
if
you
play
your
cards
right,
you
could
have
a
ride
on
my
chair,
baby.
He
says
I'm
buying
but
if
you
play
your
cards
right,
Honey,
only
if
you
promise
to
go
real
fast.

No,
thank
you.
Yeah.
You
got
a
live
one,
Honeyman.
Yeah.
Here
you
go.
Thank
you.
Well,
that's
the
slowest
service
It
only
took
us
20
years
to
get
these.
Be
cool.
You're
gonna
get
us
arrested
again.

And
I
probably
wouldn't
mind.

I
think
he
likes
it.
Oh,
yeah.
So,
I
guess
this
one's
mine,
huh?
ART:

Happy
birthday
to
you
RICHARD:
You've
gotta
be
kidding
me.
Happy
birthday
to
you
Happy
birthday,
dear
Richard
Happy
birthday
to
you
Hey,
come
on,
make
a
wish.
Yeah.
-Hey,
Richard.
There's
something
What's
that?
Does
this
wheelchair
make
my
butt
look
big?
I'll
see
you
around,
Art.
Yeah.

Everyone
pretends
Why
am
I
knocking
on
your
door?
It
never
opened
for
me
before
Up
against
the
glass
I
wonder
what
it's
like
For
ordinary
people
Running
through
your
life
Don't
you
wanna
fly?
Ordinary
people
Why
am
I
knocking
on
your
door?
It
never
opened
for
me
before
Sometimes
I
feel
I
shouldn't
be,
I
couldn't
be
Sometimes
I
feel
I
shouldn't
be
here
You
go
the
other
way
I
thought
I
heard
you
say
You
wish
you'd
never
come
Tearing
through
the
time
Would
you
try
to
right
Why
am
I
knocking
on
your
door?
It
never
opened
for
me
before
Sometimes
I
feel
I
shouldn't
be,
I
couldn't
be
Sometimes
I
feel
I
shouldn't
be
here
Is
everybody
lost
before
they're
found?
I
don't
wanna
be
forgotten
this
time
around
No,
no,
no
Sometimes
I
feel
I
shouldn't
be,
I
couldn't
be
Sometimes
I
feel
I
shouldn't
be
here
I
shouldn't
be
here
Sometimes
I

I

I

Sometimes
I
