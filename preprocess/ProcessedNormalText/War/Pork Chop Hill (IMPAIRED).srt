Hello,
my
GI
friends.
Good
morning.
courtesy
of
GI
friends,
this
is
the
dawning
of
what
your
politicians
choose
to
call
"a
police
action",
"a
minor
affair".
Which
has
already
cost
you
more
GI
friends...
you
want
peace.
We
want
peace.
We
too
had
to
leave
our
homes
Why?
Show
your
stubborn
generals
that
you
will
no
longer
fight
Show
them
that
you
want
peace...
Lay
down
your
arms
and
we'll
be
glad
to
lay
down
ours.
Lieutenant
Clemons,
sir?
Oh,
Forstman.
I've
been
expecting
you.
-
Did
you
check
with
Battalion,
sir?
-
Did
you
tell
them
about
my
36
points?
Sir,
Battalion's
got
a
million
guys
Who's
the
most
apt
to
make
a
mistake?

This
is
King
Company.
Hey,
get
off
there!
According
to
my
figures,
and
-
Well,
come
on.
Tell
him.
Is
it
paid
for?
No,
sir.
My
kid
brother's
a
boy
scout.
He
-
He
won
a
Cadillac
convertible.
Yes,
sir?
I
mean,
yes,
sir!
Sir,
it's
the
colonel.
Maybe
that's
the
armistice.
Maybe
those

Battalion's
found
your
36th
point.
-
It's
Colonel
Kern,
direct.
-
That's
gotta
be
it,
the
old
peaceola!
Lieutenant,
prepare
to
counterattack
-
You
understand
this
is
only
an
alert?
Yes,
sir,
my
men
are
all
here,
except
my
Yes,
sir,
I
understand.
Very
good,
sir.
We
need
two
new
squad
leaders.
Is
it
good
news,
sir?
If
it
ain't
good
news,
sir,
I
can
give
you
the
exact
hour,
the
minute,
You
gotta
count
me
out
on
this
one,
sir.
Forstman,
I
could
tell
you
stories
But
sir,
Battalion
can't
add.
I
consider
the
rotation
system

solid
You're
right.

Lieutenant
O'Hashi,
sir?
You're
the
executive
officer.
-
Permission
refused.
Ever
heard
of
channels?
Why
not?
They
called
us.
Get
out
of
here,
Forstman.
You're
talkin'
to
a
man
in
a
black
mood,
OK,
OK.
If
that's
the
way
it
is,
I
want
I'll
have
it
entered
into
company
records.

Another
raisin?
My
mouth's
full
already.
Cotton.
Why
don't
they
get
some
heat
in
here?
Aren't
you
cold?
I'm
from
the
Panhandle.
That's
cold.
Sometimes
when
we
talked
the
words
Had
to
drop
'em
in
a

pan

out
what
we
were
talkin'
about.

Lieutenant
Clemons.
Maybe
it's
a
reprieve,
Yes,
sir.
Pork
Chop's
been
lost.
They
were
right
-
Who
goofed
this
time?
Waldorf,
maybe
nobody
goofed.
They
never
heard
of
rotation.
-
We've
gotta
counterattack
'em
at
night?
No
time
for
a
reconnaissance.
Don't
ask
me
how
we're
Let's
go.
We
gotta
make
it
before
daylight.

you
feel,
Joe.
But
you're
a
pro
-
you'll
do
all
right.
-
I'd
better
do
all
right.
Is
Pork
Chop
worth
all
this?
Pork
Chop's
just
cost
one
company
Are
you
telling
me
it's
worth
all
that?
Well,
look,
Tsugi.
Pork
Chop
is
just
Every
time

that
answer
your
question?
Hey,
McKinley,
you
got
Yeah.
You
got
Right
here.
-
What
colour's
that
car,
Forstman?
Man,
it's
a
Cadillac!
Keep
that
sight
covered,
soldier.
-
What
do
you
know
about
this
guy?
That
tells
me
a
lot.
Probably
just
enough
to
bury
you,

plenty
of
Chinese
around.
I
repeat
my
request
for
food,
water,
Show
them
this,
sir.
Blue
Six.
Blue
Six,
this
is
King.
Can
you
hear
me?
Over.
What'd
he
say,
sir?
He's
taken
the
hill.
King
Six,
can
you
hear
me?
Over.
Nothin'
but
a
lot
of
noise.
-
Try
'em
again
later.
That's
what
they
look
like
alive?

You
hold
the
whole
hill
now
and
your
tactics
and
bravery
However,
I
must
point
out
a
simple
truth.
The
more
ground
you
take,
Look
around.
It's
hard
to
fight
and
look
over
You'll
excuse
me.
Soldier,
you
take
'em
to
the
rear,
Olds.
Payne.
I
want
you
to
find
Lieutenant
Waldorf.
Tell
him
to
expect
shellings
Counterattacks
in
between.
Give
every
man
an
assigned
defensive
-
You
got
it?
All
right,
head
for
the
bunkers.
-
You
first.
I
need
that
radio.
You
pass
the
word
along.
Hi,
Sam.
-
Have
some?
Awfully
good
beans.
You
oughta
have
-
And
my
name's
not
Sam.

Comin'
through.
Who
invited
you
here,
anyway?
Don't
you
I've
been
invited
to
nicer
places.
Come
on,
Chuck.
Let's
find
a
place
where
Yeah,
and
a
thicker
roof.
Come
on,
come
on,
will
ya?
Come
on,
will
ya,
clumsy?
What
do
you
-
You
are
very
funny
today
Well,
come
on,
will
ya?
Chuck!
Chuck!
Chuck?
Chuck!
Charlie!
Chuck!
Hey,
Chuck!
Hey!
Ooh.
What?
I'm
sorry,
Chuck.
I'm
sorry.
-
Come
on.
-
I
said,
come
on.
I
can't
leave
him
there,
sir.
It's
no
use...
trying
to
figure
it
out.
You
just
have
to
keep
on
going.
The
shelling
has
stopped.
You
pass
the
word
along.
Come
on.
Go.
I
told
you
to
hurry
up,
didn't
I?
Didn't
I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
-
Hey,
Corporal.
Where's
your
CO?
Get
up
there
fast.
Keep
your
eyes
open.
Hey,
Lieutenant,
Walt.
-
What
the
devil
are
you
doing
here?
Weren't
you
guarding
prisoners
Yeah,
I
was.
Whitey,
contact
the
platoon
leaders.
-
The
Korea
Hilton.
We're
all
strung
out.
We
ran
into
Hey,
uh,
what's
goin'
on
here?
I've
had
about
40
casualties
The
order
I
got
was
They
must
be
crazy.
Walt,
feed
your
men
in
up
here.
Sergeant,
move
your
squad
right
up
here.
Watch
out
for
snipers.
Don't
get
trigger-happy.
Boy,
am
I
glad
to
see
a
radio.
-
What's
the
news
from
Panmunjom?
I'll
be
damned...
Who
lives
upstairs?
-
You
bring
us
any
supplies?
Try
to
get
Battalion
on
that
thing.
Blue,
this
is
George.
Over.
We're
even
short
on
ammo.
I
can
let
you
have
some.
I'm
not
sure.
I
think
I've
got
about...
35.
-
You
lost
over
100
men?
There's
about
ten
from
Love
Company,
-
Can't
you
make
that
work?
-
Try
the
emergency
frequency.
Blue,
this
is
George.
Over.
-
They're
on
this
one
too.
Here,
let
me
have
it.
-
Walt?
When
this
shelling
stops...
you
and
your
You'll
have
to
get
up
there
fast.
I
just
flat
don't
get
it.
Back
at
the
rear
-
This
hill
worth
it?
Worth
what?
I
doubt
if
any
American'd
Probably
no
Chinese'd
give
you
two
bits.
The
value's
changed
Maybe
when
the
first
man
died.
Oh,
hell,
Walt.
I'm
weary.
Well,
it's
hardly
beautiful.
-
Here.
Well,
don't,
dammit.
OK.
Too
thirsty
to
be
noble.
-
What
do
you
hear
from
Cecil?
She
just
spent
a
week
with
your
mother.
Put
this
back
before
I
drain
it.
I
wrote
to
her
you
were
safe
and
sound
on
Sounds
like
old
home
week,
sir.
My
brother-in-law.
OK,
you
stay
here.
Keep
trying.
-
Find
me
if
you
get
'em.
Blue,
this
is
George...
Sergeant,
we'll
take
over
the
right
sector.
-
Lieutenant.
Gave
up
trying
to
reach
you
on
the
radio.
-
Oh,
well,
he
can't
mean
this.
I
think
the
order
originated
You're
to
withdraw
your
company
at
1500.
Oh,
no.
Um...
they
must
be
sending
up
I
don't
think
so.
From
your
messages,
they
seem
Well,
I
don't
get
it.
Every
time
I
get
through
flame-throwers,
medical
supplies,
Does
that
sound
like
You
take
this
message
back.
Tell
'em
I
do
not
think
the
crisis
up
here
is
Tell
'em
I
have
very
few
men
left,
Tell
'em
Lieutenant
Russell
has
only
55
When
they
go
out,
it
is
not
reasonable
OK.
I'll
admit,
it
doesn't
seem
Well,
good
luck.
Well,
Walt.
Congratulations.
In
three
hours
you'll
be
Listen,
they're
gonna
change
the
order
You
keep
trying.
Payne,
you
stay
here.
I'll
be
in
the
George
If
Jurgens
shows
up
with
any
rations,
-
Yes,
sir.
I'll
be
first
in
line.
I
ordered
you
to
the
rear.
They
fixed
my
arm,
sir.
They
gave
Well,
I
started
down
the
hill,
and
I
decided
So
I
turned
around
Who
do
you
think
you
are?
Turn
around
again.
Now
hear
this.
The
first
bulletin
of
the
day
Weather
clear,
but
atmosphere
stormy.
Casualty
report.
Your
American
in
sharp
fighting
for
Pork
Chop
Hill.
How
much
is
it
costing
you?
-
Still
playin'
on
it
like
a
fiddle,
sir.
George
Company
guys
I
heard
a
bang.
-
Lieutenant
Clemons?
-
I'm
from
Division.
I'm
the
assistant
public
information
-
Pictures
of
what?
-
Which?
And
the
folks
at
home
We
don't
wanna
be
in
the
way.
Give
us
Well,
Walt,
have
you
any
suggestions
I'd
better
not.
I'd
hate
to
live
through
this,
Look,
would
you
mind
telling
me,
just
how
you
two
-
Will
you
cut
that
out?
Look,
Lieutenant.
Nobody
up
here's
in
the
mood
for
posing.
There's
something
you
can
do
for
me.
Take
a
message
to
Battalion.
I
won't
clutter
it
up
with
details.
"We
must
have
help,
Do
you
mind
if
I
let
him
take
it?
I'd
like
to
stay
here
and
help
out.
You
can
help
a
lot
more
and
telling
Division
what
you
saw
here.
Lieutenant,
I
guess
Anyway,
I
hope
Thanks.
I
don't
think
we
have
a
right
Think
we
should
We've
got
to.
For
all
I
know,
OK,
sir.
Make
sure
the
message
Do
they
really
wanna
hold
Pork
Chop?
It's
just
that
simple.
In
the
meantime,
do
we
still
take
Yes,
Carl.
The
order
stands.
We
may
lose
the
hill,
but
I'm
not
Not
until
I'm
assured
we
don't
intend
I'll...
take
your
wounded
down
with
me.
Joe,
uh...
You
know
when
you
said
to
me
that
I
think
I
know
what
you
meant.
They
say
that
nothing's
got
a
value,
I
don't
know
how
men
can
put
a
higher
If
that's
what
you
meant,
I
think
that
Pork
Chop's
already
worth
-
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you?
You
take
care
of
yourself.
-
Well,
good
luck.
Whitey,
let's
go.
I'll
see
you,
Joe.
What
do
you
make
the
count?
25
men,
all
told.
We
can't
hope
to
hold
all
this.
Try
to
hold
onto
this
highest
bunker,
There's
high
ground
all
around
it.
We
won't
have
any
link
with
the
rear.
Hasn't
done
us
much
good,
anyway.
-
Hey,
take
that
with
you.
The
Reds
might
find
some.
Take
it.
Ain't
no
use
leavin'
them
behind.
Sure,
why
not?
It's
every
hen
for
herself,
girls.
Come
on,
soldiers!
Up
top!
Anybody
in
here?

Don't
you
move.
I'm
aimin'
straight
at
your
belly.
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
hell
there
ain't.
They
gave
it
to
us
Now
you
just
say
that
word
or
I'll
shoot.
-
Franklin?
But
I
don't
know
who
you
are,
But
you
know
I'm
no
Chinese.
And
serve
ten
years?
But
I
ain't
that
stupid.
I
could
kill
you
-
Nobody
but
you.
Ten
years,
you
say.
Ten
years
for
what?
What
I
care
about
this
stinkin'
hill?
You
oughta
see
where
I
live
back
home.
I
sure
ain't
sure
I'd
die
for
that.
It's
a
cinch
I
ain't
gonna
die
for
Korea,
Chances
are
you're
gonna
die,
like
it
At
least
we've
got
a
chance
to
do
it
A
lot
of
men
came
up
here
last
night.
They
don't
care
any
more
A
lot
of
'em
had
it
They
came
up
and
fought.
There's
about...
25
of
them
left.
That's
a
pretty
exclusive
club.
You
can
still
join
up...
if
you
want
to.
I'm
gonna
move,
Franklin.
They're
all
up
there.
You
oughta
stay
down
Payne'll
call
me
if
they
stop
jamming.
Hello,
GIs.
I
hope
you
can
hear
me
loud
and
clear,
I
have
been
ordered
to
tell
you
that
If
you
don't,
we
will
attack
and
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
That
is
the
message.
Now...
I'm
talking
to
you
You
are
brave
men.
You
have
fought
a
good
fight.
I
don't
want
you
to
die,
any
more
You
have
earned
the
right
And
I'm
glad
I
have
45
minutes
You
are
young,
and
I
am
young.
We
should
be
thinking
Listen.

Go
on,
beat
it!
Why
are
you
hangin'
around?
You
wanna
I
heard
the
Chinese
don't
eat
chow
mein.
You
heard
wrong.
Chop
suey's
American,
I
read
it
in
Reader's
Digest.
I
stand
corrected.
Doesn't
that
make
you
think
of
Love.
Marriage.
Why
must
you
die
before
Think
about
it.
I'm
thinkin'
about
it.
43
minutes
left.
All
you
have
to
do
is
Hey,
where
do
you
think
you're
goin'?
Noplace.
I'm
gonna
try
that
radio
myself.
If
you
get
through,
You
think
I
oughta
ask
'em
Let
the
Chinese
walk
right
in,
You're
the
boss,
Joe.
Doesn't
mean
I
can
think
straight.
I
guess
I
wanna
hold
this
hill...
Stinking
little
garbage
heap.
Sir,
I
got
Battalion
on,
clear
as
a
bell.
Whatever
you
do...
it's
OK
with
me.
King
Six.
Look,
uh...
I've
about
25
men.
They're
completely
spent.
I
expect
a
heavy
attack
about
dark.
Unless
we
can
be
reinforced,
Clemons
says,
if
they
can't
be
reinforced,
Colonel,
I
know
Clemons.
He'd
never
send
this
message
if
he
-
What'll
I
tell
him?
Even
Division
can't
tell
him
anything
Lieutenant,
we
can't
reinforce
and
we
That's
a
hell
of
a
way
to
run
a
railroad.
Sir,
what's
the
date
today?
It's
April
17th.

40
minutes
left/
To
surrender
with
honour.
What
are
we
talking
about?
You
know
that
this
insignificant
little
hill
If
we
can
settle
on
the
truce
line
this
hill
is
in
So
how
can
it
be
worth
any
man's
life?
Don't
you
feel
some
responsibility
Cigarette?
Sorry.
I
had
to
get
out
of
there
They
know
we're
not
gonna
And
they'll
keep
us
talkin'
till
they
take
it.
Why?
What
do
they
gain
if
they
do?
What
do
they
lose
if
they
don't?
They've
gotta
succeed
or
lose
face.
I'd
like
to
believe
that.
I
could
say,
let
'em
have
their
face
These
aren't
just
Orientals.
-
Why
did
they
pick
Pork
Chop
to
attack?
No.
I'm
beginning
to
think
Its
value
is
that
it
has
no
value.
That
makes
it
a
test
of
strength,
They're
willing
to
spend
lives
for
nothing,
That's
what
they
want
to
know.
That's
some
question.

Two
minutes
left/
Still
time
to
live.
Hold
your
fire
to
the
very
end.
Hold
your
fire.
I'm
goin'
up
to
the
top
for
a
look-see,
One
minute/
Don't
fail
me,
my
friends.
This
is
your
last
chance.


Listen
at
'em.
Call
for
flares.

is

Hey,
Joe!
Saw
some
men
coming.
Sir?
Sir,

is
on.
King
Six.
Over.
You've
got
to
hold
out.
The
advance
element
should
be
there
Hold
out
a
while
longer.
The
leading
elements
There's
no
more
ammunition,
sir.
They're
coming
down
behind
us!
Sir,
they're
behind
us,
everywhere.
All
right,
plug
up
these
holes.
