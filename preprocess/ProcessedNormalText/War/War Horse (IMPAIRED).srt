You

We
can't

And

I'll
train
him.
You
stay
out
of
this,
Albert.
Please,
Mum.
Please,
let

I
can
do

We
have
to
keep
him.
No
choice.
Right.
Well,
you
got
one
month
or
I'm
taking
him
back
myself.
How'd
you
get
to
30?
It
was
Lyons.
We're
going
to
lose
everything.
After
all
we've
been
through,
Don't
worry,
Mum.
I'll
raise
him.
Well,
you
better.
Go

get
started!
See
if
a
child
can
undo
what
your
fool
Easy,
boy.
Easy.
Easy.
Right.
Let's
make
a
start
then.

It's
oats.
Very
tasty,
that
is.
Come
on.


I'll
bet
you're
missing
your
mother.
Look
at
you.
First
time
without
your
mum.
But
you're
not
alone,
are
you?
In
fact.
'Cause
I'm
here.
It's
all
right.
All
right.
I'm
going
to
call
you
Joey.
Joey.
That's
you.
And
I'm
Albert.
It's
all
right.
You're
mine
now.
You're
mine.



Good
boy.
Good
boy.
Good
boy.
Come
on.
Whoa.
I
want
you
to
stay
there,
Joey.
Stay.
That's
it.
Good
boy.
That's
it,
you
got
it.
ANDREW:
Hey,
look
at
him,
Albie!
He's
playing
Grandma's
Footsteps!
All
right.
Come
on,
Joey.
Back
you
go.
Come
on.
Back
you
go.
You're
all
right.
That's
it.
Good

All
right.
You
got
to
stay
there.
You
understand?
That's
it.
Good
boy.
Good
boy.
You've
got
it.
Good
boy.
ANDREW:
Good
boy.
Good.
Now
call
him.
Whistle.
Come
now,
Joey.
Come
on.

You
can
come
now,
Joey.

-
I
don't
think
he
fancies
your
owls.
It's
how
the
Indians
Now,
Joey,
when
I
whistle,
My
dad
had
a
dog
He
used
to
run
up
behind
you
He's
not
a
dog.
He's
just
puzzling
it
through.


Will
you
look
at
you!



Albie!







There's
only
15
here.
The
rest
will
come.
You
know
by
rights
I
could
And
I'm
a
great
believer
in
my
rights.
It
will
come.
If
you
drank
less
beer
you
might
be
able
to
I
said
I'll
pay
you.
The
bottom
field's
rock
hard.
No.
We're
going
to
plow
it.
Just
give
me
till
the
autumn.
I'll
pay
How
are
you
going
to
plow
it?
He'll
do
it.
You'll
not
get
that
one
in
a
harness,
even
drunk
on
a
Tuesday
night.
And
I
can't
wait
for
the
money,
I
promise
you
that
field
will
be
plowed.
We'll
plant
it
with
turnips.
The
money
will
be
yours
Please,
sir.
Please.
Very
well.
If
that
fancy
plows
that
field,
I'll
give
you
till
October
What
if
he
doesn't?
I'll
take
the
horse
on
the
day
he
fails.
And
I'll
take
your
father's
farm,
hold
their
pints
and
hold
their
heads
No,
please.
Sir,
you
can't
do
that.
Now,
now,
lad.
What?
Ted
Narracott,



-
You
can't
harness
him.

You're
scaring
him,
Dad!
-
He
can't
take
a
plow!
ALBERT:
He
won't
be
able
to
do
it!
He's
too
young.

Ted!

It's
all
right,
boy.
It's
all
right.
I
knew
this
would
happen
Ted,
no.
Ted,
no!
He's
worth
nothing
to
me.
If
he
won't
take
the
collar,
-
Dad?
Dad,
stop!
You
shoot
that
horse,
we
have
nothing.
ROSE:
No!
You
were
right
what
you
said,
Dad.
You
told
Lyons
he'll
plow
that
field,
You'll
see.
He'll
show
you.
We'll
show
you.
We'll
get
it
done.
Let
go.
Let
go.
Go
back
to
the
house.
Some
days
are
best
forgotten.
How
are
you
today,
Joey?
I
don't
know
much
about
life,
boy,
but
I
do
know
that
there
are
big
days
Most
days
are
small
days,
and,
well,
But
this...
Well,
this
is
a
big
one.
This
is
our
big
day!
It's
cold
out
there,
If
it's
tough
for
you,
Now,
I'm
going
to
teach
you
And
you're
going
to
learn.
Then
we
can
be
together,
which
is

Steady,
boy.
Here
we
go.
Here
we
go.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Now,
boy.
Easy.
Easy.
Look
at
me,
Joey.
See?
See?
You
just
got
to
put
your
nose
through.
That's
it.
See,
you've
got
it.
You've
got
it.
Good
boy.
There.

Too
large,
too
rocky,
Even
a
sturdy
plow
horse
Yet
he
will,
I
say.
You'd
swear
he'd
sprout
wings
and
fly
It's
a
fine
thing,
loyal
to
your
mate,
A
team
of
two
might
manage,

Ted
too
squeamish
to
watch,
is
he?
Of
course
he's
watching.

ALBERT:
Come
on.
Come
on.
Well,
you've
raised
him
up
Picture
of
his
father,
he
is.
Not
a
dollop
of
ordinary
sense,
that'll
lead
him
to
insist
Wasn't
a
farmer
in
Devon
leaving
your
brothers
that
fine
farm
and
setting
yourself
at
this
stony
patch
You've
fettle
enough
for
20
men.
But
with
a
gimpy
leg
and
the
drinking...
For
the
pain,
isn't
it,
that
you
drink?
None
of
us
could
have
anticipated

me

me
to
rent
you

place,
not

at

you
were
a

she
did!
And
now
your
son's
sinking
into
See,
Joey?
I
got
the
collar,
too!
Okay,
come
on,
boy.
Walk
on.
That's
it.
Walk
on!
Walk
on,
Joey.
Come
on,
boy,
walk
on!
You'd
be
better
off
standing
at
the
top
Gravity's
the
only
friend
Walk
on,
Joey!
Walk
on!
Come
on,
Joey,
walk
on.
Walk
on,
boy.
Walk
on.
Come
on,
walk
on.
It'll
take
the
whip
to
move
him.


Bravo!
You
reached
the
top
of
the
hill!
You'll
make
even
better
time


ALBERT:
That's
the
way.
Now,
come
on,
Keep
straight.
Good
lad.
Good
lad.
Good
boy.
Now
come
on,
dig
in!
(VILLAGERS
SHOUTING
Albie,
we're
all
with
you!
ALBERT:
Come
on,
keep
it
straight,
boy.
That's
it,
walk
on.
Walk
on.

Look,
look,
the

hasn't
even
cut
yet.
Do
you
know,
I
knew
when
I
first
saw
you
That's
why
he
bought
you.
He
knows
you
have
all
the
courage
I
knew
when
I
first
saw
you
Whoa.
You've
got
no
chance,
lad.
He'll
not
turn
over
half
an
acre.
You've
done
well.
You've
tried
hard.
Come
on
now,
Mr.
Lyons,
Well,
he'll
destroy
that
horse.
I'll
be
over
Thursday.
Give
you
a
day
to
close
it
up.
Your
wool.
I'm
sorry,
Rosie.
Now,
boy!
You've
got
to
do
it,
Joey!
You
don't
know,
so
I'm
going
to
The
rest
of
our
lives
depend
on
this!
So
get
set
to
pull!
And
pull
straight!
Now,
boy!
Go!
Walk
on,
Joey,
walk
on!
Whoa!
That's
it!
Good
boy,
Joey!
Good
boy!
Walk
on!
Walk

Go

That's
it.
Go
around
it!
Whoa,
Joey!

break
the

Will
you
look
at
you!

Come
and
look!

He's
doing
it!
MAN
1:
Good
lad,
Albie!
WOMAN
2:
Albert,
well
done!
MAN
2:
I
wouldn't
have
believed
it!
I'd
not
let
a
child
of
mine
slip
in
the
mud
He
could
lose
a
foot.
You'll
likelier
lose
an
eye,
Mr.
Lyons,
if
you
carry
on
prating
at
me
Or
my
plow,
or
my
horse,
or
my
field,
Come
on,
Albie!
Push
on
through!
Get
it
done,
Albie!
Get
it
done.
Albie,
are
you
all
right?
Are
you
all
right?
Up
you
get.
My
pair
of
fools.
My
mighty
fools.
You're
as
battered
-
Where's
Dad?
Stumbling
about,
I
suppose.
It's
not
the
drink,
Albert,
He
drinks,
Mum!
So
might
you
if
you'd
been
He
don't
talk
to
me
about
it.
He
don't
talk
about
it
'cause
he
can't.
Come
here.
The
mice
have
been
at
it.
Sit
down.
Here.
It's
his
campaign
pennant.
He
were
Sergeant,
7th
Battalion,
And
that
is
Every
man
who
fought
in
the
Boer
War
And
this...
That's
the
-
Not
Dad's?
He
got
that
After
he'd
been
hurt
and,
well,
I
don't
know
what
else.
He
won't
tell
me,
either.
But
the
first
day
he
got
home
First
day
he
could
walk,
and
wouldn't
hear
a
word
I
said
not
to.
See,
what
you
done
today,
and
so
you
should
be,
my
splendid
boy.
It's
good
to
be
proud
But
what
he
done
in
Africa,
Hard
as
it
surely
was
he
refuses
to
be
proud
of
killing,
I'd
be
proud.
If
I'd
gone
off
to
war,
Whether
or
not
you
think
think
how
brave
he
is
Your
dad
makes
mistakes,
and
he
drinks
to
forget
but
he
never
gave
up.
And
he
does
that
for
us.
And
today,
you
showed
the
world
You
keep
looking
after
Joey,
"Sergeant,
7th
Battalion,
You
see
this,
Joey?
It's
been
through
an
entire
war.
I'm
not
stealing
it.
I'll
give
it
back
to
him
someday.
Um...
I'm
the
only
boy
that
drives
in
That's
right,
and
this
is
my
dad's
car.
-
You're
lucky
that
you're
in
it.
I'm
not
normally
allowed
to
drive
it
Is
he
a
friend
of
yours?
Come
on,
boy.
-
Ahhh!

Well,
you're
clearly
not
going
to
be



ROSE:
Shoo,
Harold!

We
can
try
planting
something
else.
Or
we
could
hire
ourselves
out

How
else
are
What
are
we
going
to
do?
I
used
to
believe
that
God
gave
each
man
I
don't
feel
that
any
more.
You'll
stop
loving
me,
Rose,
Well,
I
might
hate
you
more,
but
I'll
never
love
you
less.

It's

We
are

with

You
hear?
They're
going
to
ring
the
bells
at
6:00,
and
then
never
ring
them
again
Look
smart,
Joey
lad!
What
has
he
done
with
him?

First
name,
middle
name,
last.
Sign.
Last
name
first.
TED:
Take
my
word
for
it,
Goes
like
a
racer,
No
curbs,
no
splints.
Good
feet
and
teeth.
And
how
much
are
you
charging,
sir,
for
this
strong,
decent,
Forty.
I'll
give
you
20
and
not
a
penny
more.
Twenty's
no
good
to
me,
Captain.
I
don't
even
know
how
he
rides.
Oh,
he
rides.
Splendidly.
You'll
be
astonished,
I
promise
you
that.
Finest
horse
in
all
of
Devon.
Finest
horse
I've
ever
seen.

Thank
you.
You
can't.
You
can't.
He's
mine.
-
I
trained
him.
You
can't
have
him.
He's
my
horse,
sir.
I'm
afraid
it's
too
late,
lad.
Please.
I'll
get
you
money.
I
will,
I'll
get
you
money.
I'll
work
for
it.
He
won't
obey
anyone
else.
He
won't
be
any
good
in
the
war
neither.
I'm
sorry.
Well,
if
Joey's
going,
I'm
going,
too.
-
I
see.
What's
your
name,
lad?
-
And
how
old
are
you,
Albert?
-
Is
that
the
truth?
and
I'm
bigger
than
most
19-year-olds,
and
I'm
strong,
sir,
I
don't
doubt
your
qualifications,
Albert,
but
the
law
is
very
clear
Your
father's
done
what
he
had
to
do,
Thirty
guineas
isn't
nearly
enough
as
fine
as
your
Joey,
I
know
that.
But
it's
all
I've
got.
Will
you
lease
him
to
me,
Albert?
I
promise
you,
man
to
man,
as
closely
as
you've
done.
I'll
respect
him
and
all
the
care
And
if
I
can,
I'll
return
him
to
your
care.
Now
say
goodbye.
It's
all
right.
All
right,
turn
it
in.
That's
enough.
Now
on
your
way.
Come
on!
Do
you
want
to
lose
the
farm?
Rose?
It's
the
way
you
did
it.
But
we're
at
war.
Aren't
we
just?

Joey.
I
told
you,
sling
your
hook!
Let
him
be,
Perkins.
This
isn't
the
end.
I,
Albert
Narracott,
solemnly
swear
Wherever
you
are,
I
will
find
you,
Steady,
steady.
Steady
now,
come
on!
Walk
on!
Walk
on,
come
on!
Get
on!

-
Take
good
care
of
him.

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.

PERKINS:
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Steady,
steady.
Whoa,
whoa,
Joey!
Stop
mucking
about,
you
hear?
Good
boy.
Good
boy.
Steady.
Steady,
steady.
Come

Easy,

Who?
Not

Not

at

Still,
not

I
wouldn't

He's

All
right,

listen
here.
Everything

The

Yes,

I

As

All
right,
then.
Let's

I'll

Over

Captain
Nicholls.

Come
on,
Joey,
I
know
you've
got
it.
NICHOLLS:
Come
on,
boy!


Nice
of
you
to
turn
up.
He's
got

I'll
give
him
that.
He
has
everything.

What
are
you
up
to?
I'm
writing
a

With
a

in
it?
It's
to
the
boy
who
owned
Joey.
I
want
to
show
him
Before
we
take
him
across
the
Channel
Yes,
before
that.
4:00

Charlie.
What
do
you
think
of
the
new
cap?
Silk
lining.
I
quite
like
it.
I'm
not
sure
it's
going

Oh,
I
don't

You
might

instead.
Or
alternatively
think,
"I
fancy
that

Hadn't
thought
of
that.

That

the

We
have
been
watching

and
they
have
pitched

Knock

out
and
we

in
and
come
at
them
from
the

Twice

of

and

And
we
have

on
our
side.
We
have

Good.
So
today
it
is.

No,

it

be

Literally.
Never

Hey,

Eh?

We

Get
moving!

No,
not

You.
Come.
I'm
keeping
you
here.
You're

with
the

if

continues

They're
pushing
through?
We
will
move
later,
when
we
find
Yes,

Perhaps
I
can

He's
also
very
good
with
horses.
No.
Not
necessary.
It's
all
right,
Gunther.
You
are
not
going.
I'll
tell
them
you're
only
14.
Father
signed
me
in.
He
knew
my
age.
Mother
obviously
never
told
you
Of
course
she
did.
I
just
wasn't
listening.
But
you
need
to
listen
now.
I
made
her
a
solemn
promise
With

Michael.
They'll
never

a
head
count.
There
are
too

of
us.

underneath

what?
Gunther,
it
will
be
fine.
And
when
all
the
machines
break
down
I'll
see
you
at
the
front.
We'll
be
together
again.
Gunther.

GUNTHER:
I'm
giving
this
to
you.

To
keep
you
safe.


Ah!

Get
back
in
line!
I'm
hungry.
Did
you
bring
food?
I'm
sorry.
-
Will
Father
be
ashamed?
Maybe
at
first
he
will
be.
But
in
the
end,
he
will
be
glad.
And
us?
What
about
us?
I
was
ready
to
go.
I
was
proud
to
go.
I
wanted
to
go.
The
food
in
Italy
is
good.
Yes.
And
what
about
the
women?

Not
as
good
as
the
food.
Because
they've
eaten
You
are
too
young
for
war
I
don't
feel
so
young.

Not
any
more.

What?
We
have
a
big
night
of
riding
ahead.
Good
night,
Michael.
Night-night,
Gunther.






-
Schroeder.
A
mistake?
A
promise.
Ja.


Grand-père.

It's
closer
today.
The
wind
plays
tricks
with
the
noise.
I
can
hear
it,
grand-père.
And
there
is
no
wind.
You
shouldn't
lie
to
me.
Here.
There
is
no
wind
here.
But
over
there,
the
wind
is
so
strong
You
lie
about
everything!
You
say
you
aren't
worried,
I
know
the
war
is
approaching,
but
you
say,
Did
I
say
that?
You
started
lying
They're
dead.
But
you
won't
say
so.
Do
you
think
I'll
die
The
truth
is
you
should
speak
to
your
elders
If
you
tell
me
the
truth
about
the
war,
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
I've
been
keeping
in
the
windmill.
Now
who
is
the
one
telling
lies?
In
the
windmill?
Yes.
They
were
standing
in
the
windmill
This
is
François
and
this
is
Claude.
I
named
them
after
two
boys
They
must
belong
to
someone.
Horses
like
this
don't
just
appear
Yes,
I
know,
grand-pére.

Now,
Emilie...
and
if
no
one
comes
to
get
them
then
they
belong
to
me.
Emilie,
look
at
me.
You
cannot
ride.

me
what
happened
to

would
tell

on

And
tomorrow's

died
fighting.
Didn't
they?
But
when
the

come,
you
do
nothing.

You
are

is

get
there,
Can
you
imagine
such
a

Here
you
are
flying
over
so
much
pain
and
terror,

have
to
look

What
is
that?
I
hope
you
have
not
bought

that
I
then
have
to
wear,
like
last

It
was

-
Yes.
I
looked
like

Give
me

found.
Don't
worry
yourself.
Leave

was

I
hid
it

as
not

want
you
to
ride
