NARRATOR:
This
is
the
borderland
that
lies
As
it
is
today,
so
it
was
a
thousand
years
Even
then,
with
the
fires
of
hatred
and
conflict.
Each
side
prided
themselves
but
kept
themselves
always
on
the
alert.
Soldiers
of
David,
commanded
by
A
chariot
moving
along
the
road.
Stop
the
fool,
whoever
he
is.
Prince
Solomon!
Is
my
brother
here?
Prince
Adonijah
is
at
the
top
of
the
hill.
ADONIJAH:
Solomon!
On
our
way
to
Jerusalem,
we
got
word
that
the
Egyptians
I
thought
you
might
need
some
help.

You're
better
suited
than
for
exploits
on
the
field
of
battle.
Our
father,
David,
was
a
singer
of
songs,
Where
are
the
Egyptians?
They
thought
to
trap
me,
to
rush
in
on
our
camp
But
we're
not
sleeping.

-
Give
me
your
orders.
This
is
not
your
kind
of
game,
brother.
I've
never
thought
of
it
as
a
game.
Then
the
sword
of
victory,
Solomon.
And
the
shield
of
God,
Adonijah.
Spread
out
and
kill
them
all!



-
Now
we
attack!


Sound
the
retreat!

Once
again
the
Pharaoh
will
have
reason
Let
him
write
it
in
the
blood
of
his
dead.
Too
long
this
soil
Have
you
lost
your
taste
for
blood
After
seeing
the
glory
of
victory,
the
greater
glory
of
peace
Peace
is
for
women
and
children.
Now
let
me
cleanse
my
mouth
To
a
new
victory
To
the
warrior
Prince
Adonijah!
ALL:
To
Adonijah!
To
your
glory,
brother.
ALL:
Hail
Israel!
There'd
be
much
greater
glory
were
not
shackled
"Defend,
but
never
attack."
When
I
am
king,
into
which
my
enemies
can
flee
I'll
pursue
them
into
the
streets
We'll
hunt
them
down
like
dogs.
-
We'll
rout
them
out
of
the
houses.

Highness,
this
one
was
found
among
Put
him
down.
The
Pharaoh
has
many
mercenaries
but
I've
never
seen
one
like
him.
From
where
do
you
come?
I
have
the
honor
to
serve
Her
Majesty,
The
Queen
of
Sheba!
We're
a
long
way
from
the
land
of
Sheba,
Where
goes
the
Queen
of
Sheba,
And
why
does
a
Sheban
fight
I
fight
where
my
queen
commands.
And
it
pleased
my
queen
to
come
out
to
lead
her
troops
I'll
send
your
hide
to
this
brave
queen
No!
Grant
him
the
respect
Bind
up
his
wounds.
So
spare
him.
Out
of
regard
for
the
tender
heart
This
Sheban
Queen
amuses
herself
to
watch
them
slay
Israelites
I
doubt
if
she
found
Hezrai!
And
what
brings
More
orders
from
His
Majesty?
No,
Highness.
If
that
were
so,
Your
father,
King
David,
He
lapsed
into
a
coma
two
days
ago
His
physicians
could
give
me
Josiah,
we
ride
to
Jerusalem.
JOAB:
Hail
Adonijah,
King
of
Israel!
Hail
Adonijah!
Hail
the
King!
It
is
not
your
right
-
Adonijah!
The
King
shall
be
anointed
and
crowned
in
the
presence
the
high
priest
and
the
elders
of
the
tribes.
Your
law
may
be
the
word,
Chancellor.
-
Hail
Adonijah!
And
why
do
you
remain
silent?
Can
it
be
that
your
first
thought
Life
is
for
the
living.
When
I
know
that
David
is
no
longer
living,
I
will
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
you
HEZRAI:
I
will
follow
you,
Highness.
We
can
reach
Jerusalem
Let
Solomon
concern
himself
My
thoughts
are
for
the
living.
I
have
business
with
the
Sheban
queen.
We
must
ride
fast
to
overtake
her.
JOAB:
Horses!


Go!
Go!
Go!
HARAN:
Halt!
Stand
aside!
In
Israel,
I
give
the
orders.
I
regret
that
we
did
not
meet
last
night
Who
are
you?
The
King
of
Israel.
He
lies,
Majesty.
The
King
of
Israel
is
an
old
man,
Is
that
why
you
thought
it
safe
in
an
invasion
of
my
kingdom?
Give
me
leave,
Majesty,
You
think
you
could
do
better
now
David
lies
dead
in
Jerusalem,
We
want
no
dealings
with
the
Israelites.
Let
him
speak,
Baltor.
What
favor
do
you
seek
of
me?
If
we
were
dealing
in
favors,
I
could
have
brought
you
-
Kill
him!
Your
own
head
is
not
too
secure.
Silence,
Haran!
I
pursued
you,
not
to
ask
favors,
And
what
favor
could
an
Israelite
A
kingdom
twice
as
large
Renounce
your
alliance
with
the
Pharaoh.
Let
your
banners
fly
beside
mine.
When
I
have
overthrown
him,
that
border
on
your
own.
And
if
I
refuse
your
generosity?
Then
I
will
hurl
you
down
into
Yours
is
the
choice.
You
dog!
My
ancestors
sat
upon
the
throne
when
yours
still
crawled
feeding
on
roots
and
insects!
-
Is
that
your
answer?

Haran!
Hail
the
King
of
Israel!

Oh,
Solomon!
Am
I
in
time,
Abishag?
He
still
lives.
Your
mother
and
I
We
must
have
hope.
My
prayers
have
been
answered.
That
you
are
here
while
your
father
-
Mother.
My
son.
Do
not
despair.
Is
there
hope?
His
heart
still
beats.
But
his
breath
is
so
quenched
My
father,
my
king.
Let
my
prayers

Solomon.
The
peace
of
the
Lord.
In
my
dream,
Now
I
am
here,
Father.
And
where
is
your
brother?
Adonijah
was
detained
with
his
troops.
Ever
the
soldier
before
all
else.
Send
messengers
It
will
be
done.
Now
rest
until
your
strength
returns.
Bring
me
Nathan
the
Prophet.
I
am
here,
0
King.
Summon
the
elders
of
the
12
tribes
I
have
had
a
vision
from
God.

You
have
been
summoned,
Hear
the
words
of
the
King.
Has
there
been
no
report
from
No,
Sire.
None
have
returned.
Then
I
must
act
without
him.
Forty
years
I
have
reigned
over
you.
And
I
have
been
your
father,
Excepting
the
memory
of
me,
I
leave
but
one
monument
to
my
name,
the
unity
of
Israel,
symbol
of
the
12
tribes.
Once
separate,
But
now
you,
the
elders
of
the
tribes,
banded
together
You
were
the
last
And
as
a
pledge
of
your
loyalty,
you
brought
me
your
only
child,
Abishag.
I
have
loved
and
cherished
her
as
I
have
loved
and
cherished
Israel,
of
which
she
has
become
She
has
been
an
honor
to
my
house.
DAVID:
And
to
the
household
of
David.
And
my
day
is
almost
done.
But
the
day
of
Israel
has
hardly
dawned.
It
is
well
that
I
make
room
for
another
-
No,
you
stay
the
king.
MAN
1:
His
Highness,
Prince
Adonijah!
MAN
2:
Adonijah!
Sire,
I
have
driven
like
a
fury
Ever
since
your
command
reached
me.
Behold
the
two
halves
of
me,
the
soldier
and
the
poet.
I
have
loved
you
both
dearly.
Tell
me,
No,
Sire.
Jealousy
of
what?
Have
I
a
desire
It
is
Adonijah's
destiny
to
rule,
It's
God
who
decrees
As
I
lay
close
to
death,
a
great
voice
called
to
me
and
said,
"I
am
the
Lord
thy
God
"And
this
I
declare
unto
you.
"Only
in
peace
can
Israel
prosper
"Not
in
strife."
And
again,
the
Lord
God
Jehovah
"Behold
a
son
has
been
born
unto
thee,
"wherefore
thou
hast
"And
I
will
establish
his
kingdom
forever."
-
The
kingdom
is
mine.
You
made
good
use
You
used
his
weakness
-
I
knew
nothing
of
this.
-
Adonijah.
You
accuse
your
brother
falsely.
After
you've
chosen
him
over
me?
They
are
Israel.
Let
them
choose.
JOAB:
Aye,
hear
us!
Adonijah!
ALL:
Adonijah!
And
you,
the
elders,
what
say
you?
Accept
the
will
of
God,
Adonijah.
The
crown
is
mine
and
I
shall
fight
for
it.
JOAB:
Adonijah's
the
rightful
heir.
Act
not
with
violence
Adonijah,
believe
me,
I
have
never
done
Words
from
the
mouth
of
a
hypocrite.
Isn't
yours
the
act
of
a
hypocrite,
in
coming
here
to
greet
your
father?
You
who
proclaimed
yourself
king
even
though
you
knew
Has
Hezrai
spoken
truly?
I
did
not
know
Could
you
not
wait
I
am
weary
with
waiting.
Above
all
others,
In
proclaiming
yourself,
I
claimed
what
was
mine
by
right
How
long
will
it
take
them
Solomon,
king?
Impossible.
No,
it
is
revealed
out
of
the
mouth
why
God
has
turned
his
face
from
him.
The
wisdom
of
God
passeth
As
it
is
written,
so
let
it
be
done.
Bring
forth
the
waters
of
Gihon,
anoint
Solomon
king
of
Israel.
NATHAN:
By
the
grace
of
God.
Yield,
Adonijah,
yield,
Never!
Rather
would
I
bend
knee
than
to
this
brother
Then
hold
high
the
tablet
of
unity
so
that
he
may
ever
remember
Hail
Solomon!
By
the
grace
of
God,
King
of
Israel!
ALL:
Hail
Solomon!
By
the
grace
of
God,
King
of
Israel.
Turn
not
against
thy
brother,
Solomon.
His
blood
is
hot
but
it
will
cool.
You
have
my
pledge,
Sire.
And
you,
my
child,
will
you
remain
Or
will
you
return
to
Gilead
When
I
was
brought
to
the
house
of
David,
and
I
came
with
joy
in
my
heart.
With
the
same
joy,
I
will
remain
One
thing
remains
heavy
on
my
heart.
In
my
youth,
I
dreamed
to
house
the
Ark
of
the
Covenant.
But
I
sinned
greatly
and
was
not
fit
Redeem
my
vow,
my
son.
Pledge
me
that
you
will
build
so
that
God
will
have
his
dwelling
place
I
promise
you
it
shall
be
built.
Be
strong
and
of
good
courage.
Dread
not
nor
be
dismayed.
Oh,
Lord,
my
God,
instead
of
David,
my
father,
Give
therefore
unto
thy
servant
that
I
may
judge
thy
people,
that
I
may
discern
between
good
and
evil.
For
who
is
able
to
judge
this
GOD:
Because
thou
hast
asked
this
thing
nor
riches
for
thyself,
but
hast
asked
for
understanding
behold,
I
have
done
I
have
given
unto
thee
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
ways,
keeping
my
statutes
I
will
give
unto
thee
both
riches
and
honor
so
there
shall
not
be
any
like
unto
thee
in
all
thy
days.

-
Not
good
enough.

With
you,
I'm
seldom
good
enough.
Very
well.
I
should
have
killed
him
Patience,
Highness.
Wait.
-
I'm
not
a
patient
man.
Leave
us,
Joab.
Did
you
not
hear
His
Majesty,
Joab?
For
a
man
whose
wisdom
you
are
showing
a
surprising
lack
of
it
I
have
come
to
ask
a
favor
of
you.
Knowing
that
this
hand
of
mine
mustache
I
know
what
is
in
your
heart.
All
I
ask
is
that
you
love
your
country

That
would
make
me
the
greatest
patriot
David
has
laid
a
great
burden
upon
me,
and
to
build
the
temple
of
Jehovah,
But
you
have
elected
to
remain
here,
depriving
the
people
of
your
great
talent
To
build
is
not
enough.
What
has
been
built
must
be
defended
For
that
task,
Return
to
Jerusalem.
Offer
your
services
not
to
me,
You
are
offering
me
Yes.
Even
though
you
know
that
one
day
Yes.
Well?
I
am
trying
to
decide
or
the
fool
of
fools.

NARRATOR:
So
Solomon
walked
And
through
a
long
era
of
peace,
With
the
completion
of
the
temple,
Solomon
had
fulfilled
Solomon,
King
over
Israel!
Lord
God
of
Israel,
Heaven
of
heavens
cannot
contain
thee.
How
much
less
this
house
Yet
hear
thy
servant
and
his
supplication
and
let
thy
word
be
verified
which
thou
spakest
unto
my
father,
David.
And
of
thy
people,
Israel,
when
they
shall
pray
toward
this
place,
hear
thou
in
Heaven,
For
they
be
thy
people
that
all
the
earth
There
is
none
else.
ALL:

Amen
Come,
come,
come.
Come.
-
Oh,
Majesty!
Come
and
join
us,
Baltor.
Takyan
disapproves.
I
need
an
ally.
That
is
exactly
what
the
Pharaoh
The
Pharaoh
is
complaining?
Another
message
Let
it
wait.
But
it
is
a
serious
matter.
The
Pharaoh
has
called
a
conference
Sit
down,
Baltor.
You
make
Tokki
nervous.
A
deeper
shade,
Takyan.
Pomegranate.
That
is
the
right
color.
Well,
Baltor,
Your
Majesty,
They
proclaim
peace,
and
for
what
purpose?
They
are
afraid
of
the
Pharaoh
perhaps.
What
have
we
to
fear?
In
spite
of
our
eternal
hatred,
True,
but
our
security
is
threatened.
Almost
fanatically
A
dreamer.
A
man
of
peace.
But
a
man
of
ideas.
And
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
-
The
threat
is
real?
Solomon's
strength
is
not
only
his
army,
His
God?
We
have
a
hundred
gods.
But
this
is
one
god
who
teaches
that
What
a
foolish
idea.
And
yet,
if
that
idea
the
Queen
of
Sheba
would
soon
As
would
all
other
absolute
monarchs.
Therefore
I
strongly
advise
Your
Majesty
You
see,
Baltor,
to
catch
the
bird,
Perhaps
we
can
help
the
Pharaoh
and
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone.
Since
Solomon
came
I've
watched
his
strength
grow,
until
now
his
power
has
become
And
the
wealth
in
trade
now
finds
its
way
to
him.
For
too
long
we
have
delayed
plans
Yes,
take
up
arms
against
him.
Raise
a
great
host.
King
Eglon,
from
Moab,
I
will
send
you
2,000.
Kaldu,
from
Chaldea,
More
if
they
are
needed.
We
will
launch
the
attack
From
the
north,
the
east
and
the
south,
The
Israelites
will
not
know
We
will
drive
them
into
the
sea.
And,
Sheba,
what
force
None.
Why?
Are
you
not
my
ally?
We
must
put
an
end
to
Israel,
and
with
it
You
talk
of
war.
How
can
you
destroy
an
idea,
a
faith,
There
is
only
way
it
can
be
done.
What
do
you
suggest?
Have
you
a
plan?
I
have.
But
for
every
plan,
there
is
a
price.
What
do
you
want
this
time?
The
Port
of
Melish
on
the
Red
Sea
-
It
is
impossible.
This
time
you
ask
for
too
much,
Sheba.
Tell
me,
what
would
be
You
know
very
well.
And
I
offer
you
a
plan
almost
without
cost.
His
Majesty
hesitates,
Baltor.
Perhaps
we
should
return
to
Sheba
Wait!
I
grant
it.
And
how
will
you
destroy
Solomon?
It
is
said
that
Solomon
is
wise.
But
no
matter
how
wise
a
man
may
be,
he
is
still
human
with
a
human
weakness.
I
will
sit
at
the
feet
of
Solomon
and
perhaps
I
will
learn
from
his
own
lips
Truly
the
way
of
a
woman
The
way
of
a
woman
is
simple,
my
lord.
It
is
always
to
follow
the
way
of
a
man.
I
shall
keep
myself
informed

Mother!
Mother,
come!
Look!
Mother!
Halt!
My
compliments.
I
am
Benaiah,
Captain
of
the
King's
Guard,
sent
to
escort
you
into
Jerusalem.
Greetings.
Your
Majesty,
the
King
of
Israel
wishes
me
Truly
your
king
has
built
nobly.
And
all
that
for
a
god
BENAIAH:
Forward!



Do
you
think
she
will
be
This
is
something
I
never
thought
to
see,
How
can
a
pagan
unless
she
be
brought
to
know
him?
We
must
never
forget
Because
she
is
an
ally
of
Egypt,
we
must
show
her
our
unity
Let
us
offer
her
our
friendship
in
the
hope
that
we
may
have
one
less
enemy

She
is
very
beautiful,
isn't
she?
Your
Royal
Majesty,
Her
Royal
Majesty,
the
Queen
of
Sheba.
Israel
extends
a
warm
welcome
I
am
grateful
for
Your
Majesty's
After
so
much
traveling,
to
have
at
last
reached
your
destination.
If
I
had
traveled
10
times
the
distance,
it
would
be
forgotten
and
in
the
splendor
If
it
pleases
you,
we
can
dispense
You
are
most
considerate.
But,
first,
let
me
offer
a
token
you
have
shown
Baltor!
Haran!
-
So
many
gifts.
Such
riches.
I
have
no
adequate
words
to
express
Along
with
them,
I
offer
my
hand,
in
the
hope
that
this
day
will
mark
between
Israel
and
Sheba.
That
would
be
Benaiah,
do
you
suppose
the
land
I
would
think
so,
yes.



We
must
not
keep
the
Queen
waiting.
-
Welcome.
Her
Majesty,
the
Queen.
His
Majesty,
King
Solomon,
sends
Has
commanded
us
to
inform
Your
Majesty
that
he
would
be
most
happy
He
is
most
gracious.
How
thoughtful
of
the
King
Oh,
he
doesn't
know
I'm
here.
Then
I
am
even
more
pleased.
Come
in.
You
are
the
first
How
interesting
your
encampment
is.
Are
your
people
We
enjoy
life
and
pleasure.
-
Don't
you?
But
we
are
an
austere
people.
And
your
king?
Is
he
also
serious?
King
Solomon
has
a
great
responsibility.
He
must
maintain
the
unity
It
is
very
important,
this
unity?
Oh,
yes.
The
gods
of
Sheba.
Mal-Ra,
the
guardian
of
destiny.
Kol,
god
of
the
sun
and
stars.
Rama,
who
sends
the
rain.
We
have
many
gods.
In
Israel,
we
have
one
God.
When
he
fails
you,
He
never
fails
us.
You
must
find
it
gratifying
Are
you
his
sister,
perhaps?
Sometimes
he
calls
me
that.
We
have
been
very
close
to
each
other
ever
since
I
came
to
live
Do
you
stay
long
in
Israel?
That
depends
upon
your
king.
You
are
charming,
innocent.
And
you
fulfill
all
my
expectations.
For
you,
from
the
land
of
Sheba,
This
Solomon,
the
Almighty.
Almighty
what?
Twenty
men
surrounding
him
King
Solomon
has
entertained
Oh,
those
state
banquets.
I
at
one
end,
he
at
the
other,
and
in
between
us,
Not
once
have
I
been
with
him
alone,
But,
Your
Majesty,
This
Solomon
is
more
difficult
to
approach
This
great
king
has
time
for
everything
Send
him
to
me,
Rha-gon,
god
of
love.
Make
me
the
most
desirable
of
women.
Make
my
lips
sweet
as
honey,
my
skin
soft
and
fragrant
Give
him
to
me.
I
want
him
at
my
feet.

TAKYAN:
Your
Majesty
has
a
royal
visitor.
Her
Majesty
and
I
have
met
before.
My
apologies
to
Your
Majesty.
I
regret
that
I
was
unable
to
welcome
you
to
Jerusalem.
Had
you
been
there,
it
would
have
Your
Majesty
is
too
gracious.
Rather
different
from
the
occasion
If
I
remember
rightly,
Yes.
And
as
a
king,
I
offered
you
And
my
answer
was
not
too
kind.
So
I
remember.
This
time,
I
venture
to
offer
you
Do
you
come
as
envoy
I
come
as
Adonijah,
An
alliance
between
us
could
give
us
Do
you
want
Sheban
arms
Solomon
is
the
usurper.
Once
I
am
on
the
throne,
and
all
of
the
kings
would
be
at
our
mercy.
Why
should
I
want
them
at
my
mercy?
I
maintain
good
relations
with
the
kings.
And
King
Solomon
is
my
friend.
So
how
could
your
offer
Has
the
screaming
eagle
How
dull
the
world
would
be
I
am
wiser,
Prince
Adonijah.
I
no
longer
do
battle
with
the
sword.
That's
why
I
find
your
visit
here
I
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
you
have
What
else
could
I
bring
to
King
Solomon,
Your
Majesty,
it
is
clear
With
Your
Majesty's
permission.
I
think
I
understood
you
better
He
is
still
a
dog.
HEZRAI:
Let
the
women
in
judgment
Never
before
has
an
alien
Her
presence
here
profanes
all
Israel.
Who
makes
complaint?
My
Lord
King,
this
woman,
Leah,
I
was
delivered
of
a
child.
On
the
third
day
after
I
was
delivered,
There
was
no
one
in
the
house
In
the
night,
this
woman's
child
died
Wherefore
she
removed
my
son
and
laid
her
dead
child
against
my
bosom.
-
She
lies!
SOLOMON:
Silence!
And
when
I
arose
in
the
morning
Not
so,
Lord
Solomon.
The
truth,
Lord
King.
For
when
I
looked
at
the
child
in
my
arms,
It
was
her
own
child
and
none
other.
The
living
child
is
mine,
the
dead
is
yours.
The
dead
is
yours,
the
living,
mine.
Bring
the
infant
forward.
Josiah.
Place
the
child
upon
the
steps
before
me

Draw
your
sword,
Josiah.
Divide
the
child
into
two
parts.
Give
half
to
the
one
woman,
Oh,
no!
If
it
must
be,
give
the
child
to
her
Divide
it.
It
should

Take
your
son,
Mother,
MOTHER:
May
the
Lord
God
Jehovah
You
would
have
rather
surrendered
him
And
take
this
woman
hence
and
administer
to
her
She
lies!
She
lies!
It's
not
right!
The
child
is
mine!
Mine!
Now
at
last
And
your
wisdom
amazes
me.
Whatever
wisdom
has
been
given
me
Continue
to
teach
me,
I
beg
of
you.
So
that
I
may
gain
a
greater
insight
It
will
enable
me
to
become
a
better
Real
wisdom
lies
in
the
ability
to
decide
Can
you
believe
that
only
four
years
ago,
You
have
such
a
joy
It
is
a
joy
to
make
the
desert
bloom
You
have
made
this
into
a
paradise.
The
water,
the
work,
In
the
last
few
days,
but
you
have
not
told
me
At
this
moment,
my
own
land
In
my
youth,
I
used
to
dream
of
visiting
And
now
instead
You
rule
Sheba
alone?
From
the
beginning
of
time,
That
is
our
law.
I
would
be
happy
to
tell
Your
Majesty
if
I
were
sure
Why
do
you
say
that?
Because
after
all
the
times
you
have
not
returned
the
compliment
Perhaps
I
was
waiting
for
an
invitation.
You
promise
to
accept?
I
promise.

I
am
so
happy
that
at
last
My
people
feel
honored.
It
is
your
guest
who
feels
honored.
You
are
not
bored
No,
it
interests
me

Enough,
Takyan.
If
I
do
not
prevent
it,
the
fabled
Solomon.
The
way
I
stare
at
you?

This
is
the
hour
of
Rha-gon.
Every
evening
I
make
an
offering
to
him.
Rha-gon,
giver
of
life,
god
of
love,
accept
this
token
The
feast
of
Rha-gon
is
the
in
the
land
of
Sheba.
But
tonight
let
there
be
no
talk
of
gods.
Not
even
of
wisdom.
And
there
is
Sheban
wine
My
offering
to
you.
Tonight,
we
are
alone
in
a
different
world.
My
world.
Yes,
we
are
in
a
different
world.
Is
not
the
wine
to
your
taste,
my
lord?
It
almost
made
me
forget
An
enemy
of
Israel.
Your
Majesty,

I
chose
this
one.
Mmm.
Attar
of
roses,
I
love
it.
The
king's
favorite
scent.
-
How
do
you
know?
I
don't
want
to
remind
him
What
else
have
you
heard?
They
complain
There
is
no
reason
In
spite
of
the
way
he
left
here
before,
he
must
have
had
difficulty
Tonight
I
will
make
it
even
more
difficult.
Dry
me.

He
may
still
come,
Majesty.
Do
I
need
you
to
tell
me
the
time?
Take
it
away.
Get
it
out
of
my
sight.
How
dare
he
treat
me
this
way?
What
does
he
think
I
am?
I
don't
care
if
he
never
comes!
Never,
never,
never!
Weren't
you
supposed
Yes,
I
was.
Then
why
are
you
sitting
here
alone?
I
felt
the
need
of
being
alone.
What
is
it
that
weighs
so
heavily
Has
it
come
to
where
-
Haven't
I
always
shared
your
thoughts?
At
times,
a
man
feels
drawn
even
at
the
risk
of
his
own
destruction.
Like
a
moth
approaches
a
flame.
Is
there
something
different
I
could
put
it
out
in
one
second.
Wouldn't
that
be
simpler?
Such
a
little
flame,
Abishag.
And
yet
unrestrained,
Simpler,
yes,
but
perhaps
without
it,
In
light
or
in
darkness,
I'll
be
at
your
side
always.
-
Good
night.
His
Majesty!
His
Majesty!


Sire,
Her
Majesty
and
then
she...
She
retired.
SOLOMON:
I'm
sorry.
Takyan,
admit
His
Majesty.
I've
disturbed
your
rest.
Could
I
rest
thinking
that
perhaps
Now
you
have
to
be
Why
did
you
come
to
Jerusalem?
Why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
now?
Because
from
the
first
I
knew
is
the
brain
of
a
very
clever
woman
who
would
never
have
traveled
You
have
found
me
out.
I
will
confess
to
you.
The
Pharaoh
is
paying
me
a
fabulous
price
to
deliver
to
him
all
of
your
secrets.
I
have
considered
that,
Pharaoh
is
aware
How
could
I
hope
to
deceive
you?
I
have
been
trying
to
entrap
you,
To
bind
you
to
me
in
soft
chains
so
that
I
may
do
with
you
as
I
will.
Now
perhaps
we're
approaching
the
truth.
Every
woman
exacts
her
price
from
a
man.
You're
a
queen,
I
do.
I
want
you
to
love
me
wholly,
completely,
and
that
love
to
be
I
hope
it
is
true,
but
if
it
is
not,
then
let
me
remain
blind
to
the
truth.
Even
when
you
are
not
with
me,
to
recapture
every
moment
The
words
you
have
said
to
me,
After
what
has
come
to
pass
between
us,
Tell
them
to
me.
Behold,
thou
art
fair,
my
love.
Thine
eyes
are
as
doves.
Thy
lips
are
as
pomegranates.
How
much
better
is
thy
love
than
wine?
I
have
never
before
known
such
happiness.
Nor
I,
and
if
I
have
thought
I
was
happy,

ADONIJAH:
You
look
like
two
birds
who
Oh
You
may
speak
freely.
We
have
come
to
take
counsel
About
what?
I
am
the
commander
of
the
host,
It
concerns
the
king.
-
Then
why
not
consult
with
him?
Grave
criticism
is
being
brought
Who
would
dare
to
murmur
His
association
with
the
Sheban
queen
Worse,
he
has
even
brought
this
daring
to
install
her
in
an
apartment
Well,
that
is
his
affair,
not
mine.
We
thought
perhaps
if
you
were
to
Point
out
that
his
conduct
not
only
to
the
high
priest,
I,
presume
to
admonish
His
Majesty?
You
forget,
Hezrai,
he
is
the
king.
Well,
something
must
be
done.
Not
by
me.
You
are
his
chancellor,
Hezrai,
You
do
something.
You
reason
with
him.
We
had
hoped
for
the
cooperation
You
have
it.
We
thank
you
for
receiving
us,
Highness.
Not
at
all,
not
at
all.
JOAB:
It
could
not
have
served
if
your
Highness
had
arranged
The
priesthood
is
aroused
against
him.
Even
the
people
talk
openly
of
his
shame.
Your
Highness
I
would
be
a
fool
You
might
have
to
wait
forever
I
will
solve
Hezrai's
and
at
the
same
time,
my
own.
Or
rather
this
is...
This
is
a
problem
that
you,
Joab,
I
await
your
command,
Highness.

Your
Majesty
commanded
me
It
took
you
long
enough
to
get
here.
Ten
minutes
ago,
if
Your
Majesty
pleases.
Come
in.
In
what
way
can
I
serve
Your
Majesty?
You
can
arrange
Stop
looking
at
me
like
that!
-
But
when,
Your
Majesty?
Your
Majesty
will
pardon
me
Do
I
have
to
consult
you
first
Your
Majesty
would
go
without
accomplishing
her
purpose
Permit
me
to
decide
the
question
Your
Majesty
will
forgive
me
if
I
venture
to
touch
Get
to
the
point,
Baltor.
I
have
sensed
a
change
in
Your
Majesty.
A
softening.
A
desire
to
evade
reality.
You
are
accusing
me
Is
that
it?
I
hope,
for
Your
Majesty's
own
sake,
And
if
such
is
the
case,
do
you
deny
me
the
right
May
I
remind
Your
Majesty
that
no
matter
what
they
are,
above
your
commitment
to
the
Pharaoh
Don't
lecture
me,
Baltor.
It
was
Your
Majesty
who
once
told
me
that
you
could
not
afford
the
luxury
that
always
you
were
forced
to
remember,
that
your
only
love,
your
only
thought,
And
with
that
in
mind,
in
search
of
a
means
to
destroy
Yes,
Baltor.
I
have
been
trying
to
evade
reality.
I
have
found
myself
trying
as
one
would
try
to
forget
an
evil
dream.
I
have
been
reluctant
The
most
merciful
way
to
kill
is
to
thrust
But
it
seems
to
me
than
we
were
before
we
came.
You
are
wrong,
Baltor.
I
have
known
for
days
Suppose
I
get
his
permission
to
hold
to
set
up
a
pagan
god
their
one
God
to
have
no
other
God
before
him?
That
would
cause
more
The
priests
and
the
people
Yes,
Baltor.
His
own
people
would
accomplish
his
end.
Are
you
satisfied
now
Majesty.
How
many
times
Over
and
over,
I
will.
But
you
have
known
so
many
loves.
I
will
take
you
by
the
hand,
and
in
the
temple,
before
all
Israel,
To
shut
me
away
in
your
harem?
To
share
your
love?
No,
to
share
my
throne
with
you.
You
honor
me,
but
I
am
already
a
queen.
We
will
join
our
lands
A
dream
that
can
never
be.
Nothing
must
stand
between
us.
Not
even
our
gods?
I
knew
this
moment
would
come,
for
the
things
we
believe
in
I
had
hoped
that
in
time
As
King
of
Israel,
would
you
abandon
Still
I
dared
hope.
My
love,
I
must
leave
Israel.
Why?
Why?
I
cannot
let
you
go.
The
time
has
come
Can
you
grant
me
permission
It
would
be
a
sacrilege.
Then
I
must
go
to
celebrate
it
elsewhere.
You
see?
You
cannot
banish
No,
wait.
Listen
to
me.
No!



SHEBA:
Help!
Help!
The
King!
Help!
Guard!
Josiah!
Guard!
Joab.
Are
you
safe,
Sire?
We'll
deliver
him
to
the
one
who
sent
him.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Thank
all
the
gods
you
are
not
harmed.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I...
I
feared
only
for
him.

SOLOMON:
You
men,
that
way.
Are
you
expecting
me
In
the
past,
because
of
your
great
value
to
Israel
and
because
I
pledged
our
father
I
asked
for
no
such
pledge.
But
tonight
you
raised
your
hand
You
and
your
Sheban
slut
I
sought
only
to
preserve
our
country
Only
because
the
blood
of
David
as
well
as
through
mine
but
I
banish
you
from
Israel
forever.
I
suppose
I
should
be
grateful
to
you
but
you
should
be
more
concerned
if
it
has
not
already
been
lost
-
Remove
him,
Josiah.
NATHAN:
I
charge
you,
Solomon,
you
have
permitted
to
spawn
in
Israel.
Abjure
this
woman
and
her
idolatries.
Tear
down
the
obscene
abomination
I
have
given
her
permission
in
the
privacy
of
the
Vale
of
Seth.
A
pagan
revel!
An
orgy!
I
have
no
apology
to
make
As
I
have
commanded,
so
shall
it
be.
You
have
broken
God's
covenant
"Thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
"Thou
shalt
not
make
unto
thyself
"Thou
shalt
not
kill."
If
Sheba
had
not
escaped,
the
The
permission
I
have
granted
her
for
the
crime
attempted
against
her.
It
seems
that
in
your
lust
for
this
woman,
Choose
your
words
carefully,
Hezrai.
It
was
out
of
love
that
I
offered
And
out
of
love,
I
will
attend
her
ritual.
Hear
me,
Solomon.
I've
heard
all
I
want
to
hear
from
you,
Then
hear
the
voice
of
God.
Your
royal
raiment
will
be
stripped
You
will
cry
out
your
repentance
but
the
ears
and
hearts
of
your
people
And
my
ears
are
closed
I
will
show
you
I
am
king
in
Israel,
not
you.
NATHAN:
Woe
unto
you,
Solomon.


ALL:
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Rha-gon!
Hear
us,
0
Rha-gon,
Let
thy
spirit
enter
into
our
bodies.
Endow
our
men
with
strength
and
vitality
and
our
women
with
endless
fruitfulness.

My
door
was
closed.
Must
you
intrude
upon
my
privacy?
Can
you
shut
out
your
conscience
Say
what
you
must,
I
come
seeking
the
man
I
once
knew.
The
man
who
was
noble,
gentle
and
kind,
-
These
are
mere
words,
Abishag.
When
I
was
a
child,
But
time
passed,
My
love
became
But
the
man
became
a
king,
and
in
his
eyes,
I
know
how
strongly
it
calls
to
you.
Listen
to
your
people,
as
I
call
in
my
love.
Listen
to
them
if
not
to
me.
Whether
you
or
my
people
approve,
You
cannot
go.
Do
not
destroy
yourself!
I
beg
of
you!





Lord
God,
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant.
Mine
was
not
the
strength
to
save
But
thine
is
the
power.
Let
not
thy
wrath
descend
upon
him.
Look
into
his
heart
and
pity
him.
But
if
it
be
thy
will
to
punish
him,





Oh,
no!
Oh,
no!
Why?
The
sin
was
mine.
Why
did
you
not
strike
me?
I
warned
you,
Solomon.


Majesty,
you
must
rest.
I
cannot
rest,
Takyan.
I
have
come
to
ask
to
arrange
for
your
immediate
departure
Yes.
Let
us
go,
quickly.
There
is
no
reason
for
us
to
remain
Your
Majesty
should
not
reproach
herself
It
was
nothing
more
It
is
not
the
first
time
Nor
will
it
be
the
last.
Was
it
nothing
more
than
a
coincidence?
Surely
Your
Majesty
cannot
believe
that
it
was
a
sign
of
the
anger
-
I
no
longer
know
what
I
do
believe.
Yes,
the
strain
of
the
last
few
days
But
this
is
your
hour
of
triumph.
The
Pharaoh
will
rejoice
in
your
victory
Sheba
can
be
proud
of
her
queen.
I
am
very
proud
of
myself.
We
will
have
our
port
on
the
Red
Sea.
We
will
have
more
gold,
because
I
have
betrayed
a
great
man
who
loved
me
beyond
all
else.
The
Sheban.
The
Sheban
is
coming.
Here
comes
the
Sheban.
The
Sheban.
Come
away.
Your
Majesty
understands
that
you
attend
this
meeting
It
is
a
command
I
have
no
wish
to
evade
You
should
not
have
taken
If
I
had
not
come
now,
I
might
have
lost
the
courage
Once
you
asked
me
for
truth.
And
I
answered
you
with
truth,
but
I
made
it
sound
like
a
lie
For
I
was
a
friend
of
the
Pharaoh
and
I
came
here
out
of
hatred
Had
I
known
this
it
would
have
changed
nothing.
Mine
is
the
greater
guilt.
For
I
have
known
from
the
first
where
I
would
follow.
But
why
did
you
not
just
go
Because
I
love
you.
Do
with
me
what
you
will,
My
love
is
not
a
lie.
Think
not
to
appease
the
wrath
Neither
will
God's
anger
be
turned
aside.
I
will
speak
no
words
in
my
defense.
What
could
you
say
Because
of
you,
dissension
fills
the
land.
The
unity
of
the
nation
is
sundered.
Even
as
this,
the
symbol
of
its
oneness,

NATHAN:
The
elders
of
the
tribes
deny
you
The
Lord
God
will
smite
you
into
the
dust
So
be
it.
Folly
is
set
on
great
heights,
and
that
which
has
been
done
Who
knows
what
is
good
for
a
man
his
vain
life,
Vanity
of
vanities.
All
is
vanity.
GOD:
But
if
you
turn
away
then
will
I
pluck
them
up
by
the
roots
and
this
house
which
is
high
shall
be
an
astonishment
so
that
he
shall
say,
"Why
hath
the
Lord
done
thus
And
it
shall
be
answered,
"Because
they
forsook
"which
brought
them
forth
"and
laid
hold
on
other
gods
"Therefore
hath
he
brought
The
elders
of
the
tribes
and
the
captains
of
the
host
This
is
the
time
to
strike,
Majesty.
All
Israel
is
in
turmoil
It
seems
that
your
information
Has
not
the
Queen
of
Sheba
given
you
I
have
been
wondering,
You
mean
she
has
told
you
nothing
Nothing.
Perhaps
in
the
joys
of
her
new
love,
and
finds
her
alliance
with
Solomon
You
have
told
me
everything
excepting
your
price
for
my
support
of
you
I
want
the
crown
of
Israel.
And
command
of
the
army
I
grant
it.
But
there's
one
thing
I
want
from
you.
You
will
be
the
instrument
for
her
betrayal
of
me.
On
that,
Majesty,
you
can
rely.
Hail
to
the
new
king
of
Israel.
ALL:
Hail
to
the
new
king
of
Israel.

Can
your
brother
equal
such
strength?
He
will
be
able
to
gather
We
will
strike
quickly.
-
How
many
do
they
number?
And
you
saw
them
cross
over
the
border?
Yes,
Majesty.
It
was
to
be
expected
eventually.
We
will
go
out
and
face
the
Egyptians.
Give
the
orders,
Josiah.
Gather
what
forces
you
can.
Yes,
Sire.

With
these
we
hope
to
stem
My
father,
David,
faced
Goliath
with
nothing
more
than
a
stone
God
was
with
David.
-
Forgive
me,
Sire.
All
Israel
knows
that
God
Majesty,
you
let
him
go
What
could
I
have
said
to
him?
How
could
I
have
told
him
-
Halt.
-
Highness,
the
enemy
has
been
sighted.
Within
one
hour's
march.
Then
they
have
traveled
10
leagues
They
are
spent
and
exhausted
Two
hours
yet
before
the
sun
sets.
-
Deploy
your
men.
We
want
every
man,
horse,
chariot
And
when
he
rides
into
the
trap,
Now
deploy
for
attack!
Deploy
for
attack!
Take
your
positions!
Deploy
for
attack!
Sire,
our
men
are
spent.
They
will
rest
tonight
There
we
will
entrench
Let
the
battle
be
joined
Sire,
look
there
on
the
hill.
Halt
the
column.
Halt!
Shumanites!
They
bear
a
flag
of
friendship.
Ahab!
We
come
to
stand
with
the
king.
Why
do
you
offer
me
your
support
Is
it
because
your
hatred
for
the
Egyptians
We
come
in
memory
of
the
love
-
Then
we
will
honor
that
memory.
-
Fall
in
behind!
Josiah.
Forward
at
the
trot.
Forward!
Start
the
attack.
Attack!
JOAB:
Attack!

Form
a
circle!

Sire,
your
brother
has
joined
forces
Break
through!
Break
through!
Faster!
Tell
the
Egyptians
-
Break
the
circle!
Sound
the
retreat!

Joab,
find
Solomon!
Let's
try
over
there.
Your
Highness,
but
so
far
not
Solomon.
He
must
have
crawled
off
to
hide
himself
In
the
morning,
and
hunt
them
down
to
the
last
man.
I
have
more
important
things
Keep
searching.
There
will
be
double
the
gold
for
the
man
I
am
impatient
to
enter
Jerusalem.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
delayed
You
will
have
no
trouble
in
destroying
When
you
have
vanquished
them
then
follow
me
into
Jerusalem
How
many
men
Only
a
small
escort.
I
will
meet
with
no
more
resistance
there
Your
commands
will
be
obeyed.
Colonel
Hassin,
with
six
officers,
There'll
be
few
of
us
left
to
face
Adonijah
The
faint-hearted
are
deserting
us
Can
you
blame
them,
Josiah,
after
they've
seen
I
thought
I
knew
but
never
did
I
think
We
only
found
almost
afraid
to
show
themselves,
In
the
morning,
the
Egyptians
No
matter
how
few
of
us
are
left,
If
I
cannot
live
as
a
king,
with
honor,

Woe
unto
us!
Our
king
is
defeated!
Majesty!
The
outcry
in
the
streets
of
the
city
brought
by
deserters
It
seems
he
has
been
defeated,
Is
he
among
the
dead?
No
one
knows,
but
all
say
that
by
morning
not
one
Israelite
will
escape
alive.
Now
will
Your
Majesty
seek
safety?
The
Israelites
will
blame
you
I
beg
Your
Majesty,
do
not
refuse
again.
-
Majesty,
where
are
you
going?
I
will
not
let
Your
Majesty
Stand
aside!
I
command
you
both,
MAN:
Solomon
is
vanquished!
Woe
unto
us!
The
Lord
has
punished
Solomon
Who
will
save
us
now
from
Pharaoh?
Our
sins
have
brought
this
upon
us!
Woe
unto
us!
The
Egyptians
have
overthrown
Pharaoh
will
slay
us
all!
Solomon
did
not
follow
the
path
of
God!
God
of
Israel,
thou
who
art
called
the
all-knowing,
look
into
my
heart
and
hear
my
prayer.
Forgive
my
sin
Grant
me
the
life
of
Solomon
Do
this,
and
I
will
return
to
the
land
And
I
will
build
a
tabernacle
and
there
shall
be
Josiah.
-
What
has
alarmed
you,
Sire?
Hope
that
comes
like
a
light
It
is
as
though
God
has
come
to
me
Yes?
Sire!
-
Our
men
return.
And
there!
They
rally
to
us
by
the
hundreds.
Set
them
to
burnishing
their
shields.
Yes,
Sire.
I
remember
you
once
lectured
me,
Hezrai,
Are
there
any
among
you
Then
I
need
no
senseless
ritual
No
anointing
with
the
waters
of
Gihon.
I
take
with
my
own
hands
Hail
Adonijah,
Lion
of
Israel!
ALL:
Hail
Adonijah!
Know
this,
all
of
you.
Under
his
protection,
I
will
rule
Israel,
and
I'll
have
no
mercy
Sire,
the
Sheban
harlot
has
been
found.
She
has
taken
refuge
in
the
temple.
-
Halt!
Halt!
Again,
the
Israelites.
Where
did
they
gather
Last
night,
we
could
find
none
of
them,
In
a
few
minutes,
they
will
all
be
dead.
Today
there
is
no
darkness
They
face
east
Prepare
for
a
frontal
attack.
-
Frontal
attack!
MAN:
Frontal
attack!
-
They're
going
to
charge
us,
Majesty.

Attack.
Strike
them
down.
-
Attack!
MAN:
Charge!

Sire.
-
Now!





Lord
God
of
Israel,
thine
is
the
victory.
Thou
art
our
sword
and
our
shield.
ALL:
Lord
God
of
hosts.
Thou
art
the
Lord
God.
What
thou
hast
done
If
thou
knowest
what
is
in
my
heart,
Amen.
Ahab,
Josiah.
Choose
20
men.
Mount
them
on
horses.
Gather
up
the
Egyptians'
banners
We
will
ride
with
them
to
Jerusalem
By
now,
An
Egyptian
sword
It
is
I,
Adonijah,
who
has
prevented
and
razing
this
city
to
the
ground.
Hail
Adonijah!
Savior
of
Israel!
SCATTERED
VOICES:
Hail
Adonijah!
There,
in
the
temple,
It
was
she
What
shall
be
done
with
her?
-
Let
the
dogs
devour
her!
MAN
1:
Give
her
to
us!
The
sanctuary
of
the
temple

In
the
Israel
that
I
rule,
there
is
You
are
her
judges.
I
give
her
to
you.
Let
me
pass.
Let
me
pass.
Once
before
I
told
you
I
was
King
of
Israel
Now
I
shall
prove
to
you
I
grant
to
you
Stone
her!
-
L
have
spoken.
Obey
my
command.
Kill
the
pagan
slut!

Solomon!
Victory!
Victory!
Solomon!
Look!
Solomon!
MAN:
Victory!
Victory!
Solomon
returns!
Solomon!
Victory!
Victory!
Solomon!
ADONIJAH:
Solomon!
Once
before
but
this
time
I'll
not
be
denied!
Sheathe
your
sword,
brother.
I
will
not
break
the
pledge
I
will
sheathe
it
in
your
heart.




When
none
in
Jerusalem
believed
she
came
into
the
temple,
and
before
the
sanctuary
For
thine
is
the
power
GOD:
Because
thou
didst
call
upon
I
have
heard
thee.
Return,
therefore,
unto
thine
own
land,
and
keep
the
covenant
Now
I
can
tell
you
Now
you
will
be
queen
over
Israel
No.
I
gave
promise
to
God
For
that
he
granted
me
your
life
But
how
can
I
let
you
go?
Your
child
shall
reign
in
the
land
of
Sheba.
And
if
God
grant
us
the
blessing
of
a
son,
then
for
the
first
time,
And
he
shall
walk
That
we
must
part
is
our
atonement.
If
this
be
thy
will,
0
God,
May
thou
watch
between
us
I
will
be
with
you
always.
Shout
unto
God,
all
the
earth.
Sing
praises
unto
the
Lord,
0
Israel.
Be
gracious
unto
us,
God,
and
bless
us.
And
bless
us.
For
his
anger
is
but
for
a
moment,
Weeping
may
tarry
for
a
night,
