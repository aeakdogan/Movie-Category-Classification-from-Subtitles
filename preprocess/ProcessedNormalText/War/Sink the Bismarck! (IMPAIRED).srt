This

London.
Ed
Murrow
reporting.
To
an
American
reporter...
there
is
something
very
special
this
island,
this
nation.
Never
in
the
long
and
stormy
have
her
fortunes
been
in
this
spring
of
1941.
Britain
is
fighting
alone
fighting
desperately.
Yet
her
people
remain
Britain's
allies
have
been
as
the
dark
stain
of
Nazi
conquest...
spreads
across
the
map
of
Europe.
In
Africa,
Rommel
is
giving
Greece
has
fallen.
And
the
Luftwaffe
continues
The
worst
news
of
all
where
last
month,
German
U-boats
sank
600,000
tons
of
shipping.
In
this
battle,
This
is
the
battle
on
which
depends...
the
future
course
of
the
war...
the
future
course
of
British
history.
The
battle
of
the
North
Atlantic
but
it
is
directed
from
Very
deep
in
the
ancient
200
feet
underground,
is
the
war
room.
Here
is
the
guiding
brain
of
the
British
navy...
The
Operations
Division.
Robert.
Sir?
Take
Captain
Shepard's
things...
and
put
them
in
the
office.
Aye,
sir.
Thank
you.
This,
of
course,
is
the
message
center...
for
incoming
and
outgoing
signals.
These
tubes
lead
to
Oh,
Shepard...
That
man's
uniform.
Oh.
We're
quite
informal
here
You'll
find
it's
much
different...
from
the
bridge
of
a
ship
at
sea.
It
has
to
be
that
way.
Shepard,
this
is
Commander
Richards...
the
duty
plot
officer.
Captain
Shepard
is

How
do
you
do?
Don't
let
me
interrupt
your
meal.
Captain
Shepard,
Captain
Shepard's
taking
over
for
me.
How
do
you
do,
sir?
How
do
you
do?
Be
nice
to
her,
Shepard.
If
she
got
angry
and
walked
out,
Really?
Seriously,
you
can
depend
on
I've
done
it
many
times.
Anne,
be
a
darling,
will
you...
and
get
your
plot
report
in
We
mustn't
be
late...
forJimmy's
party
tonight.
Right-oh.
I
suppose
I
should
shed
a
few
tears...
at
leaving
this
place...
but
quite
honestly,
I've
hated
the
job.
Too
much
responsibility,
I'm
getting
a
command
at
sea.
That's
what
I've
always
wanted.
Congratulations.
I
hope
you
find
one...
that
doesn't
involve
too
much
strain.
It's
a
different
kind
of
strain.
If
a
man's
going
to
serve
in
the
navy...
he
ought
to
serve
at
sea...
unless,
of
course,
who's
already
seen
action.
He
should
still
serve
at
sea.
Yes.
Well,
I
better
get
along.
I'll
say
good-bye
now...
unless
you
have
any
questions.
I
don't
think
so.
Good
luck.
Thank
you.
We
thought
we
might
be
of
some
not
knowing
your
way
around
yet.
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you?
Yes,
there
is
something.
I
saw
a
rating
enter
the
war
room...
without
his
jumper.
From
now
on,
everyone
I
cannot
have
officers
Commander,
under
any
circumstances.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
Won't
happen
again.
Excuse
me,
sir.
I
think
you
should
know
stood
two
watches
without
relief...
I'm
sure
Commander
Richards...
doesn't
need
an
interpreter,
I
was
also
surprised
addressed
by
her
Christian
name.
To
me,
this
kind
of
informality...
is
both
irregular
and
inexcusable.
Come
in!
Sorry
to
interrupt,
sir.
Priority
signal.
Thank
you.
Huh.
Excuse
me.
Come
in.
Oh,
Shepard.
You
know
the
assistant
chief
Yes,
indeed,
sir.
Very
well.
How
are
you,Jonathan?
I
have
a
signal
here...
from
our
naval
attache
in
Stockholm.
He
reports
two
large
German
warships...
steaming
through
the
Kattegat.
What
ships
are
they?
He
doesn't
say.
Think
it
might
be
the
Bismarck?
It's
possible,
sir.
She's
just
completed
in
the
Baltic.
Couldn't
pick
a
better
time
with
this
Crete
business
and
our
convoys
scattered.
I
have
a
nasty
hunch
I
hope
you're
wrong.
Can't
afford
to
have
that
monster
loose.
Look
what
Scharnhorst
22
ships
sunk...
115,000
tons.
All
in
two
months.
They
don't
have
anything
like
She
could
stand
off
and
sink
without
ever
coming
under
fire.
Shepard,
get
on
to
Tell
him
we're
not
sure...
but
we're
very
much
concerned.
We'll
let
him
have...
every
scrap
of
information.
Aye
aye,
sir.
Oh,
and,
Shepard.
I
wish
you'd
prepare
in
case
it
is
the
Bismarck.
Very
good,
sir.
Pretty
rough
assignment...
for
a
new
man
on
the
job.
I'm
not
worried
about
Shepard.
He's
one
of
the
ablest
men
I'm
told
he's
as
cold
That's
a
slight
exaggeration,
sir.
I
want
a
man
who's
cold.
I'd
like
a
man
with
no
heart
at
all...
no
soul...
just
an
enormous
brain.
The
battle
of
the
North
Atlantic...
is
a
grim
business.
It
won't
be
won
We've
had
too
much
of
that.
I've
known
Shepard
for
years.
We've
served
together
before.
Any
particular
reason
for
the
change?
I
suspect
there
are
many
reasons,
sir...
reasons
of
a
personal
nature.
Oh.
I
see.
Well,
how
are
we
going
to
on
those
two
ships?
We
have
an
agent
in
southern
Norway...
Get
in
touch
with
him.
It's
too
dangerous
to
get
in
touch
There
isn't
time
to
go
In
this
case,
Sir,
this
man
is
I
realize
that.
All
the
same,
we
must
get
Aye
aye,
sir.

The
enemy
ships
obviously
heading
out
to
sea...
obviously
not
in
the
service
Now,
what
have
we
got
over
here
Battleships
King
George
V,
battle
cruiser
Hood...
a
few
cruisers
and
destroyers.
The
rest
of
the
fleet's

Admiral
Cunningham,
sir.

in
Crete
is

German

Why
is
it
we
never
get
Perfect
timing
for
an

the

Cunningham
and
his

Sommerville's
got
his
hands
full...
trying
to
reinforce
Malta
Scharnhorst
and
Gneisenau
We
must
keep
them
covered.
And
16
convoys
to
guard...
scattered
all
over
the
Atlantic.
If
we
had
a
hundred
more
ships...
we
still
wouldn't
have
enough.
Sir,
we've
just
had
a
signal...
from
our
agent
in
Norway.
The
message
is
incomplete.
"Sighted
two
enemy
ships
Cruiser
Prinz
Eugen
and..."
The
transmission
stopped
Did
you
try
to
get
him
back?
Yes,
sir.
No
further
contact.
Where
is
Kristiansand?
Off
here,
sir.
Southern
tip
of
Norway.
What
do
you
think,
A.C.N.S.?
I
don't
think
this
man...
would
have
transmitted
if
it
hadn't
been
something
Then
we'll
proceed
on
the
assumption...
that
it's
Bismarck.
May
I
suggest
we
put
on
air
reconnaissance?
Yes.
Everything
from
Bergen
southwards.
Tell
them
to
photograph
I'll
talk
to
Commander-in-Chief
Aye
aye,
sir.


Excuse
me,
sir.
First
sea
lord
on
the
line,
sir.
Commander-in-Chief,
sir.
Hello,Jack.
How
are
you?
I'm
fine.
Those
two
German
ships...
were
sighted
off
southern
Norway
One
is
the
Prinz
Eugen...
and
we're
not
sure
about
the
other.
Do
you
think
it's...
I
suggest
you
proceed
that
it's
Bismarck
I
can't
think
of
anything
worse.
We
can't
let
that
ship
I'll
come
to
immediate
notice
All
right.
Good-bye.
We're
directed
to
assume
accompanied
by
Prinz
Eugen...
and
that
they're
attempting
to...
break
out
into
the
convoy
lanes.
Now,
gentlemen,
they'd
have
wouldn't
they?
Here's
the
Denmark
Strait...
the
passage
south
of
Iceland...
the
Faeroes-Shetland
Passage...
and
the
Fair
Island
Channel...
between
the
Orkneys
and
the
Shetlands.
Anyone
care
to
place
a
bet?
What
about
the
Iceland-Faeroes
Not
too
near
our
bases,
Why
wouldn't
he
take
the
nearest
exit?
Fair
Island
Channel's
Too
close
to
our
air
patrol.
All
you're
saying
is
Actually,
of
course,
I'm
afraid
somehow
or
other...
we've
got
to
guard
them
all.
Have
we
any
idea
Nothing
definite.
Jenkins,
check
with
Coastal
Command...
that
they're
carrying
out
a
search.
Aye
aye,
sir.
Looks
like
two
cruisers.
That's
what
the
pilot
said.
One's
a
cruiser,
all
right.
The
other
one's...
Bismarck.
Bismarck's
been
located
in
Norway.
Definitely
identified.
Bismarck's
in
Grimstad
Fjord.
They
want
us
to
send
Bombers,
torpedo
planes,
everything.
No
luck.
Nothing.
Visibility
down
to
nil.
Cloud
down
to
200
feet,
sir.
Can't
get
a
bombing
run
200
feet
along
the
fjord
here.
What
convoy's
that,
Miss
Jackson?
What
convoy's
that,
Miss
Jackson?
O.G.62,
sir.
Right.
Now,
Miss
Davis,
take
the
Arethusa...
from
O.G.62.
Put
her
with
the
Home
Fleet.
Good.
Now
take
the
Victorious...
from
that
convoy
forming
And
put
her
with
the
Home
Fleet.
Sir,
Operations
Home
Fleet
calling.
Director
of
operations.
No,
I'm
sorry.
Well,
the
weather's
closed
in
The
aircraft
can't
see
a
thing.
Yes,
as
soon...
as
soon
as
I
hear,
right.
Right.
I
will.
Now...
take
the
Repulse
from
W.S.8.B.
and
put
her
with
the
Home
Fleet.
Right.
Home
Fleet
looks
better
now,
doesn't
it?
Yes,
sir,
but
I
wouldn't
give
much
You
do
recall
that's
a
troop
convoy...
don't
you,
sir?
Yes,
I
do.
They've
got
a
long
way
to
go...
round
the
cape
to
the
Middle
East.
This
leaves
them
unprotected.
I'm
quite
aware
of
the
circumstances,
This
is
a
risk
we
have
to
take.
We
have
to
take,
sir?
Well,
Shepard...
what
do
you
have
in
mind?
I
think
we
must
reinforce
They
can't
patrol
everything
with
what
they've
got
now.
Well,
where
do
we
get
the
ships?
We'd
have
to
take
ships
from
other
duty.
It
would
involve
some
risk.
We
could
take
Victorious
That
would
give
the
Commander-in-Chief
and
another
battle
cruiser.
What
convoy
were
they
covering?
The
W.8.S.B.,
sailing
It's
a
large
troop
convoy,
sir...
We'd
be
exposing
them
to
without
proper
escort.
Is
that
what
you're
recommending?
Yes,
sir.
You're
willing
to
gamble
I
think
there's
a
difference...
between
a
gamble
and
a
calculated
risk.
Good
for
you,
Shepard.
Of
course,
I
realize
it's...
It's
not
an
easy
decision
to
make.
The
important
ones
never
are.
All
right,
go
ahead...
and
detach
those
two
ships
Inform
Commander-in-Chief,
Aye
aye,
sir.

They're
giving
us
Victorious
Now
we
can
send
Hood
to
support
the
patrols
I
want
them
ready
to
sail
Prince
of
Wales
They're
making
adjustments
If
they
don't
finish
their
work,
Aye
aye,
sir.
As
far
as
the
rest
of
the
fleet...
we'll
wait
for
definite
information.
I
suppose
my
nerves
I've
just
talked
to
Captain
Shepard.
The
visibility
over
the
coast
of
Norway...
is
absolutely
nil.
She
may
be
there.
She
may
not.
What's
the
latest
forecast?
Pretty
bad,
I'm
afraid,
sir.
Looks
like
two
days
The
weather
report
is
Two
days
of
heavy
overcast.
Good
news,
is
it
not
so,
Captain?
It
is,
sir.
Thank
you,
Bernhardt.
We
have
a
most
interesting
The
important
moves
To
break
out
into
the
Atlantic
Yes,
but
we
have
the
advantage...
because
they
do
not
know
We
can
move
out
immediately...
or
we
can
hide
for
a
while...
under
this
beautiful
overcast.
Also,
we
have
a
choice
Group
North
has
suggested
You're
not
forgetting
that,
sir?
We
have
to
take
orders
from
Group
North.
We
do
not
have
to
take
suggestions.
Yes,
sir.
Lindemann,
we
have
I
do
not
intend
to
let
Group
North...
or
anyone
else
lose
it
for
me.
There
can
be
great
glory
in
this
voyage...
glory
for
the
Third
Reich...
glory
for
us!
For
you,
sir.
I
will
see
that
you
are
not
forgotten.
I
was
forgotten
after
the
last
war.
Until
the
fuehrer
came
to
power...
I
got
no
recognition,
no
promotion.
I
was
ignored...
just
as
Germany
was
ignored.
The
world
only
remembers
the
winners,
We
must
make
sure
this
time...
that
it
will
remember
us.
I
am
sure
it
will.
How
soon
can
you
get
under
way?
I
can
have
steam
in
half
an
hour,
sir.
I
want
to
be
out
of
here
Signal
Prinz
Eugen.
Very
well,
sir.


Sir,
it's
a
signal
from
An
aircraft
from
Hatston's
There's
nothing
there
now,
sir.
Well,
they've
sailed.
At
least
we
know
that
much.
Now
we
can
get
moving.
Position
of
all
convoys,
sir.
Thank
you.
All
we
can
do
now
is
wait
That's
the
worst
part
You
have
a
son
Yes,
sir.
He's
at
Gibraltar.
He's
an
air
gunner
in
the
Ark
Royal.
I
bet
you're
glad...
he
won't
be
mixed
up
Why
should
I
be
glad?
If
you
were,
you
wouldn't
admit
it,
He
must
take
his
chance
I
see.
There's
an
air
vice
marshal
to
help
out
on
reconnaissance.
Give
him
a
briefing,
will
you?
You
wanted
to
speak
to
the
crew,
They've
been
alerted.
Achtung!
Captain
Lindemann...
with
your
permission...
I
would
like
to
address
As
you
wish,
sir.
Thank
you.
Officers
and
men
of

this
is
the

We
are
going
out
into

to
attack
the
British

system.
We
are
going
to
sink
their
ships...
until
they
no
longer
dare
It's
true
we
are
only
two

but
the
world
has
never
seen
such
ships.
We
are

the

are

we
are
unsinkable,
and
we
are

You
cadet
officers...
you
were
selected
by
to
make
this
voyage.
When
you
return
to
the
fleet...
you
will
have
many
stories
of
German
sea
power...
stories
of
Nazi
victory!
To
all
of
you,
I
say
this...
Never
forget
that
you
are
Germans...
never
forget
that
you
are
Nazis!
Heil
Hitler!
Heil

In
the

that?

Fine.
Carry

Now,
if
your
people
can't
fly
reconnaissance
missions
We
realize
that,
of
course,
sir.
We
must
assume
that
the
Bismarck...
in
company
with
the
Prinz
Eugen...
is
going
to
attempt
a
breakthrough...
to
the
North
Atlantic.
We
don't
know
where...
and
we
don't
know
when.
If
it's
here...
or
here...
then
the
Repulse
and
the
Victorious...
and
the
K.G.
V
will
have
to
do
the
job.
If
it's
here
in
the
Denmark
Strait...
then
the
Hood
and
the
Prince
of
Wales...
will
have
to
go
after
her.
I
should
think
they'd
handle
it.
Hood's
a
great
ship.
She's
fresh
from
the
builder's
yard.
No
training
for
her
crew.
She

Excuse
me,
gentlemen.
Excuse
me,
gentlemen.
The

lord
can
see
you
now.
Thank
you
very
much,
Shepard.

Yes,
sir.
Right,
sir.
Yes,
I
will.
Commander
Richards,
who's
your
relief?
Dexter,
sir.
He's
late,
isn't
he?
A
little.
I
don't
mind,
sir.
I
do.
Tell
him
I'll
require
him
for
duty
My
dearest
Tom...
Come
in.
Thought
you
might
like
some
tea,
sir...
since
you
won't
take
any
rest.

are
you
doing

one?
No,

very.
Won't
your

about
you?
I
have
no

here.
My
father
lives
in
Canada
now.
I
thought
that
surely
you
must
No,
sir.
Nothing
at
all.
Doesn't
that
seem
odd...
if
you
don't
mind
my
saying
so?
I
was
going
to
be
married
last
year...
but...it
didn't
work
out.
His
fault
or
yours?
He
was
at
Dunkirk...
and
he
was
listed
as
missing
in
action.
It
was
just
a
year
ago...
a
year
ago
next
week.
He
was
a
rather
wonderful
man...
not
brilliant
or
dashing
but
just
rather
wonderful.
I'm
sorry.
I
think
it
helps
to
don't
you,
sir?
No,
I
don't.
Getting
emotional
about
things...
is
a
peacetime
luxury.
In
wartime,
it's
much
too
painful.
You
can't
turn
off
your
emotions...
just
because
there's
a
war
on.
You
can't
do
anything
Yes,
you
can.

you
why

Dexter's
here
in

and
he
has
rather
a
special
problem.
I
understand
you've
given
him
Correct.
I'll
require
him
for
duty
It
seems
that
his
girl
is
an

She's
got
orders
to

tomorrow
night.
I'm
very
sorry
that
Dexter's
young
lady
but
that's
beside
the
point.
Couldn't
you
make
an
exception?
I
won't
make
an
exception
or
any
other...
certainly
not
for
reasons
Well,
it's
very
simple,
sir...
either
you
have
discipline
Well,
I'm
sorry,
Dexter.
Thank
you,
sir.
By
the
way,
Jonathan...
there's
a

Yes.
Admiral
Gunther
Lutjens.
Lutjens.
You
know
this

Yes,

I

Captain?
Are
the
guns
damaged?
No,
sir.
Then
we
will
push
forward...
as
instructed
by
the
high

But
surely
the

must
realize...
Are
you
going

You
must

luck
to
you.
Thank
you,
sir.
Well,
gentlemen,
any
suggestions?
In
my
opinion,
sir...
we
cannot
leave
this

We
must
reach
out
and
pull
in...
everything
we
can
lay
our
hands
on.
I've
ordered
Rodney
to
leave

sir.
They
have
orders
until
the
Home
Fleet
closes.
They
claim
three
hits
with
torpedoes.
It
hasn't
even
slowed
her
down.
What
about
the
reports
A.C.N.S.
says
these
have
been
confirmed.
I've
notified
the
Commander-in-Chief.
What
is
C-in-C
doing
about
it?
He
hasn't
altered
his
plans.
I'd
like
to
send
him
a
signal...
telling
him
to
be
careful...
but
I'm
sure
he'd
resent
it.
Cigarette?
Thank
you,
no,
sir.
I'll
be
here
if
you
want
me.
Shepard?
Sorry
about
your
son.
Yes,
sir.

Shepard,
sir.
Hmm?

me,
sir.

took
in
an
operational
signal...

up
three

been

an
hour
ago...
so
I
couldn't
get
off
in
time.
I
heard
about
your
son...
so
I
thought
I'd
tell
you.
It
might
not
be
him
at
all,
sir...
but
you
never
know.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
very
much.
Oh,

an
hour
ago.
Jonathan?
Don't
you
understand,Jonathan?

anything.

me,
sir?

way.

it.
The

promised...
promised
to
send
help.

They
will
be
along
any
minute
now.
You
will
see.
He
was
proud
of
that.
"Tomorrow

world."
He
said
that
only
yesterday.
He
was
right.
Heil
Hitler.
