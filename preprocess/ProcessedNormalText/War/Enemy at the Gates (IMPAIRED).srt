I
am
a
stone.
I
do
not
move.
Very
slowly,
I
put
snow
in
my
mouth.
Then
he
won't
see
my
breath.
I
take
my
time.
I
let
him
come
closer.
I
aim
at
his
eye
very
gently.
I
do
not
tremble.
I
have
no
fear.
I'm
a
big
boy
now.
Ready,
Vassili?
Now,
Vassili.
Fire!
Fire,
Vassili!
Fire!
Come
on,
pick
your
feet
up.
Get
on
your
feet.
You
there,
come
along
with
me
now.
All
civilians,
get
out!
Make
way,
let
the
civilians
off.

Everyone

Thank
you,
Comrade
Commissar.
Danilov.
Political
officer,
Vassili
Zaitsev.
On
this
day,
September
20th,
1942,
arrived
in
the
city
of
Stalingrad
His
name
is
Vassili
Zaitsev.
Like
thousands
before
him,
he
came
Armed
only
with
a
rifle,
he
quickly
that
from
now
on
he
would
be
punished
that
from
here
on
What
do
you
think?
I
think
Comrade
Commissar
Let
me
go!
By
order
of
Comrade
Stalin,
Get
back
there!
Move
back!
Stand
away,
or
we
will
open
fire.
Stand
away!
Keep
back!
Get
back
or
we
shoot.
Back!
Keep
back,
there!
Make
way
for
Comrade
Stalin's
envoy.
I
carried
out
my
orders.
But
the
Germans
engulfed
us.
They
have
artillery,
aircraft,
tanks.
-
And
me,
what
did
I
have?
I
have
to
report
to
the
boss.
Perhaps
you
would
prefer
My
name
is
I've
come
to
take
things
in
hand
here.
This
city
is
not
Kursk,
This
city
is
Stalingrad.
Stalingrad!
This
city
bears
the
name
of
the
boss.
If
the
Germans
capture
this
city,
the
entire
country
will
collapse.
Now,
I
want
our
boys
I
want
them
to
act
like
they
have
balls.
I
want
them
to
stop
shitting
their
pants.
That's
your
job.
As
political
officers,
You,
what's
your
suggestion?
Shoot
all
the
other
generals
who
have
Make
some
examples.
That's
all
been
done.
Give
them
hope.
Here,
the
men's
only
choice
But
there's
another
way,
A
way
of
love
of
the
motherland.
We
must
publish
the
army
newspaper
stories
that
exalt
sacrifice,
bravery.
We
must
make
them
believe
We
must
give
them
hope,
pride,
Yes.
We
need
to
make
examples,
What
we
need
are
heroes.
Do
you
know
any
heroes
around
here?
Yes,
Comrade.
I
know
one.
That's
me.
Vassili
Zaitsev.
That's
me.
No,
you're
not
dreaming.
It's
your
name.
We
made
the
front
page.
They
haven't
changed
a
word.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
this
means?
It's
not
the
back
page.
-It's
the
front
page.
The
front
page!
They're
going
to
reprint
in
the
Caucasus,
in
the
Crimea,
Tomorrow
morning,
Stalin
himself
reading
my
words,
We're
famous,
Vassili.
He's
promoted
me
to
the
general
staff
and
you
to
sniper
division.
-
Well,
that's
good.
-
It's
very
good.
It's
great!
-
It's
great!
It's
great
for
both
of
us
Well,
now,
admittedly,
You
know,
you're
very
lucky
-
Why's
that?
to
make
sure
nothing
happens
to
you.
-
You're
too
important.
Yes.
Careful
of
my
glasses,
please,
Sorry,
sir.
-
I'm
famous.
-
We're
famous.
Vassili,
the
young
shepherd
killed
his
12th
German
officer
today.
Used
to
hunt
wolves,
-
Today
Vassili
Zaitsev
shot
his
23rd...
He
is
an
example
to
us
all.
Today
Vassili
Zaitsev
...thirty-sixth
German
officer...
...the
Germans
you
have
killed?
...eleven

More
and
more

and

from
all
branches

to
join
the

division
I
am
a
stone.
I
am
a
stone.
I
breathe
slowly.
I
aim
at
the
eye.
So
it
is
you.
The
great
Vassili
Zaitsev.
My
mother
makes
the
best
potatoes
Sounds
good.
When
she
sees
you,
-
How
many
today?
And
the
last
one,
He
was
only
a
foot
soldier.
Bless
you.
We
know
how
much
we
owe
you.
We
pray
for
you
every
day.
Every
evening
we
listen
to
them
Thanks.
You've
certainly
managed
well
My
parents
used
to
store
furniture
Sacha,
drop
that
right
now.
It's
loaded.
-
This
way,
Comrade
Commissar.
Good
evening.
Comrade
Zaitsev.
My
God,
where
does
From
all
over
the
country,
This
one's
from
the
workers
They
want
to
name
their
mine
Right,
let's
start
with
the
miners.
Come
on,
let's
get
to
work.
-
Dear
Comrades
from
the
Kuzbass...
...I
thank
you
for
your
letter
of
praise.
-
Praise?
And
I
hope
that
I
can
live
up
A-T-I-O-N-S.
Expectations.
You're
interested
in
German
literature,
It's
all
right.
It's
our
neighbor.
Right.
Where
were
we?
-
Tania,
we
have
guests.
I
recognize
you.
It's
Vassili
Zaitsev.
I
saw
your
picture
in
the
paper.
-
And
this
is
his
friend,
Commissar...
Danilov.
Tania's
like
a
daughter
to
me.
She
used
to
take
care
of
Sacha
She
even
taught
him
German.
-
They're
yours?
-
Which
university?
Moscow.
-
Shouldn't
we...
Your
offer
to
name
your
mine
a
great
honor.
H-O-N.
-
Yes,
I
know,
honor.
Shouldn't
we
try
and
make
the
point
That's
an
excellent
idea,
Vassili.
We
can
take
it
even
further,
though.
Your
battle
for
the
production
of
coal
There's
no
"K"
in
coal.
Just
one
That's
it.
Tell
me
if
I'm
going
too
fast.
-
No,
you're
not
going
too
fast.
I
just
thought...
Why
don't
you
get
some
rest?
We
should
carry
on.
We're
not
tired.
These
people
took
the
trouble
Tomorrow,
we
may
not
be
around
I
was
expecting
someone
else.
Certainly
not
someone
so
prestigious.

going

fix

Vassili!
Vassili!

Come
on!
Time
to
get
up.
They
have
a

in
the
They

us.
Come
on.
Look,
Vassili,
he's
hiding
So
far
this
morning,
he's
knocked
off
Look!

Fourth
window
from
the
left.
See
him?
Yeah,
I
see
him.
-
There,
you
got
him!
Let's
go
get
his
dog
tag.
Goodbye,
Comrade
Commissar.
Thank
you
for
your
hospitality,
You
can
borrow
whatever
you
like.
I'm
not
sure
what
they
would
say
if
I
came
back
with
an
armful
There's
some
Marx,
too.
You
were
assigned
to
civil
defense
No,
I
volunteered.
It's
such
a
coincidence
Comrade
Khrushchev
was
telling
me
how
desperately
we're
in
need
I
can't.
Our
militia
is
responsible
for
We're
already
desperately
short
of
men.
We
can
take
care
of
that.
We'll
give
you
a
dozen
soldiers
I'd
rather
stay
and
fight.
Serving
the
headquarters
is
fighting.
You
stay
here.
You
cover
us.
-
All
right.
Take
care.
Ludmilla,
come
on.
Take
the
stairway.
-
It's
a
trap.
Move
back.
He's
still
here.
-
They're
coming
straight
for
us.
He's
over
there
somewhere.
We
have
to
get
out
of
here!
-
We
have
to
get
out
of
here!
-
What
are
we
gonna
do?
Fuck
this,
I'm
going.
Ludmilla,
no!
What
does
this
mean?
"A
little
shepherd
from
the
Urals
"A
Mosin
Nagant
7.62,
"pride
of
precision
of
Soviet
production."
-
I've
seen
that
rifle
close
up.
I
even
touched
it.
I
know
him
well,
Vassili
Zaitsev.
Ludmilla
and
Anton
were
killed
today.
-
And
it
was
my
fault.
There
was
a
German
sniper.
I
walked
them
right
into
his
trap.
-
What
else
can
you
tell
me?
A
sniper
who
doesn't
relocate
He
was
very
good.
It
wasn't
just
his
shooting,
He
was
a
step
ahead
of
me
all
the
time.
That's
because
His
name
is
Konig.
Major
Konig.
To
find
you.
At
first,
we
weren't
sure
It
seems
he's
come
all
the
way
You've
caused
them
they've
sent
their
top
marksman
-
So,
what
do
we
know
about
him?
He's
director
of
their
sniper
school
Koulikov
studied
under
him
He
knows
all
his
tricks.
From
now
on
A
nobleman
from
Bavaria
against
the
shepherd
boy
from
the
Urals
It's
more
than
a
confrontation
It's
the
essence
of
class
struggle.
I'm
glad
you're
so
happy.
He
had
all
the
advantages.
No
one
shoots
like
you,
Vassili.
She's
been
transferred.
I'll
see
if
they're
ready
for
you
next
door.
Hello.
You
look
very
smart
Make
sure
they
don't
take
it
back
They
probably
will.
I've
heard
the
rumor
-
And
I
wanted
to
wish
you
luck.
From
what
Comrade
Danilov
tells
me,
It's
time.
Vassili?
-
Vassili?
Vassili?
Look
in
my
direction,
here.
Put
your
cap
back
on.
-
This
way,
Comrade
Zaitsev.
Vassili,
is
it
true
that
-
Vassili?
How
old
are
you,
Vassili?
Do
you
know
what
this
duel
Is
it
true
you
killed
your
first
wolf
Vassili,
tell
us,
how
many
fascists
Are
you
proud
to
be
challenged
It's
a
sign
the
Germans
Go
on,
my
boy,
tell
us
-
Or
rather,
no.
Tell
it
to
the
boss.
He
likes
good
hunting
stories.
Look
at
him
with
pride,
The
whole
country
is
looking
at
you.
Forgive
me,
forgive
me,
Grandfather.
So
it's
not
the
wolf
that
chooses
And
I'm
sure
your
grandfather
Except,
in
this
case,
I'm
the
game.
However,
today
what
we're
going
to
do
to
where
we
want
him
to
be.
You're
the
one
whose
life
is
valuable,
No.
No.
We
take
it
in
turns.
Next
time
it's
your
turn
to
go
first.
Son
of
a
bitch!
These
are
new
pants.
I
just
took
them
Sixteen
months
I
spent
in

Of
course,
those
were

That'll
make

send
out
a

Let's
relocate.
Hey,
Volodya.
After
the
Germans
invaded
us,
it
wasn't
They
threw
my
arse
in
prison.
"What
were
you
doing
in
Germany?"
"Excuse
me,"
says
I,
"but
it
was
"Don't
bring
our
glorious
leader
"Confess,
spy
bastard,
confess."
And
bang!
Bang,
bang,
bang!
Well,
there
wasn't
a
sickle,
And
bang,
it
knocked
out
all
my
teeth.
That's
right,
boy,
have
no
illusions.
That's
the
land
of
socialism
Hey,
it's
your
repair
guy.
I
got
him.
-
It's
about
soup
time,
isn't
it?
Well,
get
a
move
on,
Volodya.
And
try
not
to
spill
it
all
Here's
the

-
I
hope
he's
still
able
to
speak.
Nothing.
Thank
you.
So
tell
us,
Volodya.
Which
building
is
he
in?
There
is
no
way
I
know
that.
He
moves
around
all
the
time.
-
He
jumps
from
one
to
the
next.
-
I
don't
know.
Undress
him.
Put
him
in
one
of
our
uniforms.
You
see?
They're
stubborn.
That's
the
good
thing
Man,
you
got
to
admit,
Right.
-
Let's
see
if
our
customer
has
arrived.
And
now,
our
famous
shepherd
who
Major
Konig
thinks
is
an
idiot,
gets
Major
Konig

him,
aims
for
his

fires,
reveals
his
position,
and
is
shot
in

Except
Major
Konig
doesn't
fire,
because
Major
Konig
isn't
there.
Koulikov?
Don't
you
think
that
was
strange?
They
sent
him
out
It's
not
natural.
Not
without
artillery,
No.
No,
I'm
the
one
who
was
stupid.
They
don't
give
a
shit
I
mean,
it's
like
us
with
the
Ukrainians.
They'd
never
bother
a
major
Tomorrow,
we'll
kill
us
some
generals.
Whose
turn
is
it?
Mine,
I
think.
You're
such
a
cheater.
You
can't
fool
Papa
Koulikov.
And
it's
your
turn
To
victory.
This
sniper
business
What's
that
little
fellow
of
yours
up
to?
He's
probing,
Comrade
Khrushchev.
He's
testing
the
German
He's
meticulous
in
his
preparation.
Vodka
is
a
luxury
we
have.
Caviar
is
a
luxury
we
have.
Time
is
not.
He's
aware
of
that,
I
assure
you
he
will
succeed.
Good.
it
seems
your
destinies
They're
keeping
you
busy?
I
picked
this
up
from
the
kitchen.
I
thought
Mrs.
Filipov
might
like
it.
She'll
be
thrilled.
There's
plenty
more
if
you're
hungry.
You're
Jewish,
aren't
you?
There's
nothing
in
our
religion
My
father
had
a
premonition
You
mean
the
war?
He
understood
He
was
saving
up
He
said
it
was
the
only
land
The
only
land
we
had
a
duty
to
defend.
He
insisted
I
learn
to
use
a
rifle.
I
learn
to
shoot.
I
know
that
in
times
of
war
-but
I
have
a
favor
to
ask
you.
I
want
to
be
reassigned.
What's
happened,
Tania?
He
shot
him.
He
shot
him
even
though
Shot
him
on
the
run.
It
was
an
impossible
shot.
You've
promised
people
I
don't
stand
a
chance
against
this
man.
You
mustn't
talk
like
that,
Vassili.
What
if
I
told
you
we've
found
We've
got
someone,
Vassili.
Someone
close
to
him
Next
time
you
will
be
I
promise.
Now
I
have
a
favor
to
ask.
From
me?
It's
about
Tania.
Come
in.
He
doesn't
even
know
you
exist,
but
at
that
moment
you're
closer
to
him
You
see
his
face
through
the
sight.
You
see
whether
You
can
see
whether
he's
married
by,
you
know,
whether
It's
not
like
just
firing
at
a
distant
shape.
Those
faces
don't
go
away.
They
come
back
Did
Danilov
ask
you
to
tell
me
this?
He
likes
you
very
much.
I
think
Did
he
tell
you
why
No.
This
morning
a
list
arrived
It
was
a
list
of
civilians
and
sent
to
Germany
in
a
convoy
My
parents
were
amongst
them.
After
30
kilometers,
the
German
soldiers
stopped
the
train
In
the
middle
of
a
bridge,
two
by
two.
Mothers
with
daughters.
Husbands
and
wives.
They
lined
them
up
against
the
railing.
And
then
they
fired
a
single
shot
It
worked.
The
bodies
of
the
ones
who
died
I
know
they
died
together.
They
would
never
have
let
themselves
That's
Koulikov's
rifle.
It's
a
good
rifle.
Thank
you.
I
know
how
he
leaves
the
shelter.
The
tractor
factory
is
big.
I
know
exactly
where.
He
crawls
through
a
gutter
Then
he
goes
out
from
the
workshop.
In
between
the
two
It's
under
a
long
iron
foot
walk.
Good
luck,
Comrade.
I
know
exactly
He'll
be
on
the
foot
walk
over
the
gutter.
We'll
get
to
the
other
end
of
Follow
me.
-
You
go
that
way.
I'll
go
around
this
way.
Shit!
-
It's
okay.
-
No.
-
I'll
be
all
right.
Keep
your
legs
in.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Comrade
Stalin
is
asking
The
fate
of
the
motherland
is
at
risk.
The
fate
of
all
those
It's
for
them
that
we
fight
today.
Listen
to
me,
Tania.
The
Germans
If
they're
lucky,
one
in
ten
of
these
You're
highly
educated.
Every
intercept
you
translate
Every
message
you
decode
You
have
a
duty
to
survive.
Vassili
was
born
to
fire
a
gun.
You
and
I
were
born
If
Vassili
were
here,
Where
is
he?
Where's
Vassili?
Keep
your
head
down.
-
Tell
me
where
he
is.
Tania,
stay
in.
Stay
in.
Get
your
head
in.
Slow
down.
Don't
shoot.
He's
over
there.
You
see
the
pillar
in
front
of
you?
I
need
you
to
move
round
behind
it.
Go!
Tania,
I
need
you
to
find
Piece
of
glass.
You
see
the
kiln?
Behind
me,
to
the
left
of
the
factory.
-
Yes?
I
can't
hear
you.
Yes.
Do
you
see
the
two
louvers?
Yes.
Do
you
see
the
one
-
Yes.
-
Are
you
ready?
Three,
two,
one.
Hello,
Sacha.
He
was
right
where
you
said
he'd
be.
Nearly
there.
He's
very
clever.
Tell
me
about
him.
Why
was
it
his
grandfather
who
taught
His
father's
dead.
His
mother,
too.
-
Does
he
talk
about
his
father?
Did
he
go
to
school?
He
knows
how
to
write.
-
Is
it
girls
who
write
to
him?
And
is
there
a
girl
-
Not
in
his
village.
Here!
Yes.
Because
he's
handsome,
And
she's
very
beautiful.
I
know
her
well.
She
went
to
the
university.
Later
the
two
of
them
will
get
married.
At
least,
I
think
so.
And
you,
Sacha,
Because
they're
stronger.
And
because
you
like
chocolate.
All
these
people
here
so
each
night
Excuse
me!
So
every
cup
of
tea,
every
cigarette,
becomes
a
little
celebration.
Because
for
a
lot
of
us,
It's
just
something
Everyone
has
their
time.
In
the
forest,
the
donkey
for
nine.
Sorry,
but
that's
got
to
be
It
makes
no
sense
to
me
whatsoever!
The
donkey
lives
longer
It
makes
absolute
sense.
There
aren't
any
donkeys
in
the
forest.
So,
I'm
a
donkey.
People
like
you
and
Danilov
People
who've
read
books,
-
We'll
need
you
when
the
war's
over.
What
will
the
useless
I
want
to
work
in
a
factory.
My
granddad
took
me
to
a
factory
once.
There
was
this
man
there
He
wasn't
wearing
blue
like
the
others.
The
people
he
was
supervising
over,
what
they
were
doing,
it
was
simple,
it
was
clear.
And
I
thought,
Sad
to
have
a
dream
Why
shouldn't
it?
You'll
outlive
us
all.
You'll
be
the
oldest
donkey
in
the
forest.
One
hundred
and
fifty
meters
stand
Today
the
whole
world
is
watching
They
are
of
the
war.
Your
friend,
Tania.
Have
you
seen
her?
She
stays
over
there
now
Tell
the
major
we're
sending
in
to
support
the
attack
on
the
factory.
Tell
him
Vassili
will
be
there.
-
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Danilov.
You
have
to
stop
writing
about
me.
I'm
not
gonna
get
him
Sooner
or
later
he's
gonna
find
me,
I've
warned
you
before
This
time
it's
different.
You've
built
me
up
and
up
I
can't
carry
that
weight
anymore.
I
want
to
fight
just
as
a
regular
soldier.
I
understand.
The
thing
is,
Vassili,
-you're
an
extraordinary
soldier.
Nothing
more.
Why
are
you
telling
me
this
now?
What's
happened?
What's
changed?
Did
you
speak
to
Tania
for
me?
Yes.
Well,
will
she
reconsider?
I
don't
know.
She
should.
She'll
be
much
safer.
Yeah.
It'll
be
easier
to
get
her
reassigned
You
see,
the
Germans
are
preparing
The
propaganda
battle's
crucial
We
need
you
more
than
ever.
-
Tell
him
what
you
know,
Sacha.
There
was
dust
on
the
major's
boots.
Sacha
has
the
major
convinced
I
don't
need
to
tell
you
The
dust
was
yellow.
There's
only
one
place
In
the
back
of
the
chemical
factory,
Well
done.
Sacha,
wait
for
me
outside
then.
Danilov,
you
had
no
right
to
use
him.
No,
I
didn't
use
him,
Vassili.
Do
you
know
why?
Tomorrow
morning,
we're
gonna
Sacha
has
informed
the
major
So
now
you
know
-
In
the
middle
of
an
assault.
I
suggest
you
do
the
same.
Now,
I'm
aware
of
the
risks.
Comrade.
That's
the
Germans
up
there.
We're
not
very
far
now.
Sacha,
you're
playing
a
very
dangerous
game.
I
want
you
to
win.
See
there?
Keep
going
along
the
river.
It's
safe
for
a
while.
He's
dead.
We
found
this
on
his
corpse.
Your
reason
for
being
here
Pardon
me,
Herr
General.
But
I
do
not
believe...
There's
a
plane
bound
for
Berlin
Until
then
I
must
ask
you
Imagine
how
Russian
propaganda
If
you
fall,
you
will
fall
unknown.
You've
already
had
a
near
miss.
Also,
please
take
this
war
merit
cross.
It
was
awarded
posthumously
of
the
116th
infantry
division,
who
fell
here
He
was
my
son.
If
the
landing
is
captured,
Come
here.
What
did
I
tell
you?
You've
been
playing
your
fiddle
If
it's
confirmed
that
he's
dead,
-
Well,
you're
sunk.
It
was
intercepted
What
do
they
have
to
do?
They're
lying-
That's
good.
Very
good.
Write
it
then.
This
is
what
he
had
for
breakfast
This
is
a
picture
of
him
You're
the
poet.
What?
You
won't
give
up
the
riverbank.
I
don't
care
if
you've
lost
half
your
men.
Lose
the
other
half
or
lose
yourself!
Is
he
back?
He
should
be
back
soon.
The
German
attack
cut
the
lines,
Can
we
go
outside?
I
wrote
to
my
mother
about
you.
She
wanted
me
to
tell
you
if
there's
anything
you
needed,
our
family
will
be
there
for
you.
You
know
I'm
here
for
you.
They're
saying
Vassili
is
dead.
Vassili
Zaitsev
will
never
see
Surrender.
This
is
your
only
hope.
You're
upset?
Because
Zaitsev
is
dead?
You
don't
have
to
hide
it.
You're
Russian
like
he
is.
Don't
listen
to
them.
It's
just
propaganda.
He
isn't
dead.
And
do
you
know
why?
Because
I
haven't
killed
him
yet.
I'm
going
to
tell
you
a
little
secret.
Only
you,
But
you
must
swear
to
me
You
swear?
I
found
a
terrific
spot.
It's
by
the
exit
from
the
train
station.
I'll
hide
in
the
water
tower.
Tomorrow
I'll
wait
for
him
there.
You'll
see.
He'll
be
there.
He
always
is.
I
also
want
you
to
swear
to
me
that
from
now
on
you'll
stay
home
Do
you
swear?
Yes?
Good.
We
know
he's
alive,
we
know
because
Vassili
is
eternal.
Where
have
you
been?
Didn't
you
hear?
I
was
dead.
At
least,
noble
sniper
Zaitsev
Vassili
was
dead.
The
real
one.
Me.
I
was
asleep.
And
I
missed
my
chance.
Then
I
was
curled
up
in
a
corner
hiding
from
a
man
who
wants
to
kill
me.
I'll
talk
to
Khrushchev.
He'll
send
you
back
to
your
old
division.
-
Where's
Tania?
-
I've
been
to
the
shelter.
The
major
said
so.
He
told
me
you
were
waiting
for
him
Vassili.
Vassili.
Vassili.
My
little
Sacha.
I
knew
it.
-
Vassili.
I
knew
you
weren't
dead.
-
How?
I
prayed
for
the
first
time
When
I
opened
my
eyes,
waiting
to
give
me
the
good
news.
I
think
he
loves
you
even
more
than
I
do.
To
the
proper
military
authority.
I'm
calling
to
the
recent
changes
noticed
towards
fighting
He
has
attempted,
on
several
voiced
doubts
and
made
defeatist
comments
in
public.
The
inexplicable
duration
of
his
duel
can
only
be
explained
by
his
lack
Good
morning,
Sacha.
Once
again,
Don't
you
think
that's
strange?
Apart
from
me,
only
you
knew.
I
don't
hold
it
against
you,
Sacha.
You've
chosen
your
camp.
But
it
isn't
my
camp.
We're
both
soldiers.
We're
both
enemies,
I'm
annoyed
with
you,
little
Sacha,
for
not
staying
at
home
I'm
annoyed
with
you
for
obliging
me
I've
never
seen
anyone
frown
-
How
long
have
you
been
watching
me?
You've
been
snoring
away
happily
I
don't
snore,
do
I?
Like
a
pig!
-
I
suppose
I
talk
in
my
sleep
as
well?
There's
something
I
should
tell
you.
On
the
train
coming
here,
we
were
in
the
same
car.
No.
I
saw
you.
You
were
reading
and
you
fell
asleep.
I
didn't
dare
look
at
you,
You
were
scary.
Afterwards,
I
couldn't
stop
thinking
It
made
me
smile.
And
then
I
thought
of
all
the
men
who'd
make
you
laugh,
how
lucky
they
were.
And
now
I'm
the
one
lying
next
to
you.
-
Was
I
snoring?
What?
Oh,
my
God!
Tania,
no.
-
No,
get
off
me!
-
Get
off
me!
-
Get
off
me!
-
Get
off
me!
-
Let
me
go!
-and
then
I'll
run
after
you...
-...and
he'll
kill
me,
too.
This
is
what
he
wants.
I'll
get
him.
I'll
get
his
rifle
for
you,
I
promise,
Tania.
I
need
you.
You
have
to
leave
now,
Mrs.
Filipov.
The
last
of
the
boats
are
leaving.
He's
brought
you
a
pass.
You
have
to
gather
your
things,
and
we'll
help
you
carry
them
I'm
not
leaving.
This
is
my
home.
I
have
to
tell
you
something,
Something
very
difficult
to
understand.
It's
about
Sacha.
He's
gone
over
to
the
Germans.
He's
with
the
enemy
now.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
He's
become
a
traitor.
The
poor
little
thing.
What
has
he
done?
So
he's
going
to
stay
over
there?
Yes.
He's
going
to
stay
over
there.
I
shouldn't
be
saying
this,
but
maybe
it's
for
the
best.
If
the
Germans
have
won,
he'll
be
safe.
I
know
it's
wrong,
-
Tania!
-
Tania!
I
need
a
doctor.
A
doctor!
I
have
a
pass.
I
have
a
pass.
Please.
-
It's
useless.
She'll
never
make
it.
No,
she
will.
She's
my
daughter.
All
right.
All
right,
you
two,
Where
is
he?
Where's
the
major?
A
few
inches
from
your
face.
I've
been
such
a
fool,
Vassili.
Man
will
always
be
man.
There
is
no
new
man.
We
tried
so
hard
to
create
where
there'd
be
nothing
But
there's
always
something
to
envy.
A
smile,
a
friendship.
Something
you
don't
have
In
this
world,
even
a
Soviet
one,
there
will
always
be
rich
and
poor.
Rich
in
gifts,
poor
in
gifts.
Rich
in
love,
poor
in
love.
Tania
isn't
coming
back.
She's
dead,
Vassili.
She
was
cut
down
by
shrapnel.
It
was
quick.
She
was
on
her
way
back
to
you,
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
Mrs.
Filipov
She
was
coming
back
for
you.
You're
a
good
man,
Vassili.
I
want
to
help
you,
Vassili.
Something
useful
for
a
change.
-
Let
me
show
you
where
the
major
is.
Today,
February
the
3rd,
1943,
and
the
endless
columns
of
hundreds
It
is
an
unforgettable
day
of
hope
for
the
people
of
Today
after
180
days
of
growing
combat
and
as
a
result
of
the
valor
the
commander
received
the
unconditional
surrender
I
cannot
find
the
matching
name
Could
you
check
again,
please?
-and
this
is
her
name.
Yes.
This
is
our
address,
-but
she's
not
here.
This
is
the
address
of
this
place...
-
I'm
so
sorry.
-
She
wrote
to
me.
but
she's
not
here.
Believe
me.
There
is
no
