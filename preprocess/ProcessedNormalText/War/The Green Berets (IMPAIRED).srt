What
did

They
didn't

It's
no

to
be
done.
It's
pretty
hard...
...to
talk
to
anyone
about

...come
over
here
and
seen
it.
The
last
village
that
I
visited...
...they
didn't
kill
the
chief.
...brought
his
teenage
daughters
...and
disemboweled
them.
Then
40
of

...abused
his

then
they

he
didn't

...was
