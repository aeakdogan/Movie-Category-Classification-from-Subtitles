had

one
of

things

we
went

JD:
It
was
a
very
long
process
We
were
fortunate
At
one
point,
the
project
had
stalled.
One
of
the
pilots,
Captain
Kennedy,
He
was
getting
ready
to
retire
He
said,
"This
movie
has
to
be
made.
I'll
help
you
with

Get
interested
again
in
this
project.
That
was
a
key
point.
After
that,

we
were
able
to
get
this
sense

That's
what
Owen

is

He
was
the
pilot.

made
the
change
in

script.

He

helped

up

is

The

was
to

Make

We
had

needed

then,
boom,

You'd
think
they
wouldn't

it
came

we
were
shooting,

the

had

it
didn't

The
next
step
was
to
find
out
As
you
can
see,
Owen
was
who
we
went
We
felt

is

at

he
showed

knew

hard

So,
in

you
don't
want

thought

this

"
He
put
a
stop
to

early
on.
JD:
Gene's
a
professional.
He
shows
up

doesn't
chat

leaves
the

right
after

all

up,

more
anxiety

did

You

come
to

you've

create

laid
out

just
did

was

dirty

up

we
took

out

cut
his

it
didn't
look
right.
We
had
to
cut
it
again,
After

got

getting

getting

is
the
one
area

wanted

feel

He
wanted
everything
to
feel

anything
anyone
had
seen

And
when
we
saw
the
first
cut,
That's
when
we
had
to
start
"Is

a

we
released
it
as
a

For
my
tastes,

We
actually
shot

we
went
and
got
these

was
at

end

shoot.
We
were
all
extremely
exhausted.

at
our
wits'
end.
EJUP:
JD:
This
is
being
shot
There
was
a
determined
attempt
.
.
.for
Christmas.
That
was
the
movie's
theme,
WG:
John
would've
liked
more
time
People
had
scheduled
trips
back.
We
were
shooting
into
the
night.

knew
we

ended
up
getting

days,

We
brought

have

in

But
obviously,
safety's
first,
JD:
It'd
be
a
great
thing
to
drive
WG:
You
could
probably
buy
one.
JD:
WG:
You'll
see
where

more
brutal
That
was
a
problem.

when
they're
pure

look
at

that's
a
negotiation,

show

also
gotten

Then
you
go
and
address

You
can
do
it
partially

re-submit
There's
a

like

So
it's
good
that
you
can
re-submit.
Because
sometimes
.
.
.will
be
somewhat
difficult
WG:
One
of
the
things
that
got
.
.
.we
had
about
four
units
shooting.
We
had
a
second
unit
shooting
We
had
an
aerial
unit
shooting
And
a
unit
shooting
the
inserts.
By
the
end
of
the
show
in
Slovakia.
.
.
.
.
.we
had
anybody
who
could
JD:
There's
a
lot
of
guerrilla
It
helped
having
a
director
.
.
.and
shooting
it
himself.
That
enabled
us
to
do
a
lot
of
this.
The
first-time
DP,
Brendan
Galvin,
He
could
move
so
quickly.
.
.

very
helpful.

saw

wonderful.
The
look

and
the
idea
WG:
Well,
obviously
it
was
such
.
.
.we
were
relying
upon
the
weather
It
was
the
warmest,
.
.
.in
55
years.
We
went
in
thinking
.
.
.and
clouds,
which
would've
helped.
We'd
have
to
throw
up
some
screens
The
weather
didn't
help
.
.
.and
the
third
act
We'd
fully
expected
it
to
be
But
a
lot
of
it
we
had
to
make.
JD:
Somebody's
always
watching,
You
can
very
easily

destroyed
based
on
what
happens.
Rain,
in
a
situation
where

you
can't
move
to
a
cover
set,
And
there's
no
such
thing
Weather's
a
factor.

.
.if
it
was
beyond
your
control.
An
act
of
nature
Sometimes
they
won't
relent.
They'll
go,
"You
had
55
days
And
you
won't
wanna
have

take
So
you
always
have
a
cover
set.
But
it
can
take
two
or
three
hours
Weather
can
play
a
big
factor
WG:
On
this,
we
rarely
had
a
cover
set.
.
.
.we
shot
all
this
stuff
on
the
skiff
.
.
.and
the
rest
So
we
were
really
at
the
whims
We
were
always
told
by
the
studio,
You
can't
say
you're
not
We
kind
of
made
the
best
of
it.
For
the
most
part,
you
don't
notice
JD:
They
showed
a
Jack
Lemmon
film,
.
.
.where
the
film
was
shot
at
I
was
amazed
they
could
schedule
it

couldn't
do
that

can't
wait
for
your
weather,

just
gotta
work

This
is
in

It's
a
city

found

look

a
testimony.

how
dogged
he
was

the
fact
that
he
had

He
actually
took

wasn't

of
the
things

lost.

familiar--

the

great

idea
was--
In

scene

tells

get
the
sense

gonna
kill

JD:
Sometimes
there
are
subplots

together,

the

important
So
those
subplots
get

He
grew
up

Now
this
sequence
was
the
subject

was
very
hard

John
cut
it
as
pure
action,
And
this
piece,
which
was
originally

were
able
to
do

gave

an
additional
.

transformed

about

gotta

emotional
turns,
there's
the

was
hard

get
