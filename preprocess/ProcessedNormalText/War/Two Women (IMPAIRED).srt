Will
you
get
me
a
glass
of
water!
Rosetta

Signora...
Please,
Rosetta.
It's
all
over,
they
are
gone.
We'll
be
all
right.
They
are
gone,
drink.
-
Mamma
!
You
see,
Mamma
was
right,
they
are
really
gone.
We've
got
to
close
the
shop
It's
all
over.
They're
gone.
If
I
was
a
man,
I
would
shoot
them
all!
-
Want
me
to
open
up?
-
I
can't.
It's
all
out
of
shape.
Madonna,
look
at
the
smoke!
Arnaldo,
what's
happened?
A
lot
of
smoke
from
the
Tiburtino!

Giovanni,
you've
got
to
help
me
out.
-
I
want
my
daughter
out
of
Rome.
She
has
a
weak
heart,
-
You'll
go
where?
-
Those
lunatics
will
come
again,
-
Fine!
Then
the
war
will
be
over
sooner,
maybe.
-
What's
Mussolini
doing?
-
He's
got
to
say
something.
Before
they
came
to
bomb
us,
-
Oh!

Sure,
it
was.
You
might
look
in
now
and
then
-
If
you
trust
me...
We'll
make
up
an
inventory,
-
Buonanni
will
buy
the
stuff
that
might
go
bad.
-
Why
don't
you
get
away?
-
It
would
only
be
for
a
few
weeks,
-
Take
this
to
Covelli.
Come
back
in
an
hour.
If
something
had
happened
to
Rosetta
Who
would
you
have
murdered?
I'm
wasting
your
time,
Giovanni.
I'd
do
anything
for
you.
I
know,
you
were
a
good
I
wouldnt
get
my
finger
out,
for
that
bastard.
But
then
you're
just
as
two
faced
as
all
the
others!
Come
on,
you
were
with
him
then.
-
I
married
him.
You
make
me
sick.
I'd
like
to
see
you
living
like
I
did,
sleeping
So,
I
went
with
the
first
one
that
said
"I
will
Well,
how
was
it?
Don't
make
me
think
about
it.
Come
on,
sit
down.
He
used
to
tell
me
about
you,
you
know.
-
What
did
he
tell
you?
-
Really?
he
told
me
how
you
were
built.
He
bragged
about
it.
He
should
have
told
you
that
for

And
with
whom
did
you
sleep?
Your
mind's
a
sewer!
When
you're
raising
Look...
didn't
you
ever
want
to?
That's
my
affair.
What
are
you
doing?
There's
no
business
at
this
hour.
No
one's
likely
to
come
in.
You
can
shut
what
you
want,
Giovanni.
You
like
me
a
little
bit,
don't
you?
-
But
think
about
your
wife...
I
hope
a
bomb
falls
on
her,
No,
don't,
Giovanni.
Oh,
Giovanni,
be
good!
Ah
!
-
Did
you
hurt
yourself?
-
Where
did
I
hurt
you?
Here?
Giovanni
!
Giovanni,
you
must
never

Or
else
I'll
do
something
crazy.
You
better
understand
that
for
me
Nothing
Go
on.
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.
You
think
you
can
treat
me
like
that?
Nobody
can
Thanks
a
lot
for
the
wine!
You'd
better
put
a
new
lock
-
Don't
worry.
I
said
Gaetano.
-
If
there's
is
anything
new,
I'll
write
you.
it
takes
me
an
hour
to
write
one
word!
-
A
postcard's
all
right...
I
already
thought
of
that.
Ciao
!
Ciao.
Rosetta,
sit
down.
Listen,
Mamma,
don't
they
sing
well?
Dirty...
-
Who
are
you
angry
at,
Signora?
-
What
are
they
singing
about?
It
makes
you
feel
so
melancholy!
You
know
who
has
the
right
to
be
melancholy?
My
daughter
was
so
excited
about
living
That
pig!
-
What
is
it?
Where
are
we?
-
They
bombed
the
rails
ahead
of
us.
It
will
take
for
or
five
hours
to
repair
it.
-
Fuck!
-
I'm
not
thanking
anybody,
especially
not
heaven!
Look,
that's
Mount
Forcella.
-
Where's
Sant'Eufemia
?
-

Can
we
get
off
the
train?
-
We'll
have
to
walk
many
miles.
All
right?
-
Will
you
hand
me
down
our
stuff?
Oh,
the
sack!
Where
is
the
sack?

Signora,
hold
on
!
-
Thank
you.
When
is
this
war
going
to
end?
We'll
get
home
for
Christmas
Din-don
!
Din-don
!
Bells,
Christmas
and
this
all
will
be
over.
And
who
understands
you?
-
He
says
it
will
be
over
by
Christmas.
-
Tell
that
to
them!
Din-don
!
Din-don
!
Here's
how
you
do
it,
Rosetta.
Look.
Watch
out!
You
have
to
feel
it
sitting
on
the
middle
Easy,
like
this.

I've
lost
the
skill
myself,
Arrivederci
!
-
Arrivederci
!
-
Those
Germans
aren't
so
bad
after
all.
What
pretty
creatures
you
are!
Rosario,
hurry
up
with
that.
When
you're
through
and
for
Luigino
some
slices
of
salami.
-
What
time
can
we
leave
tomorrow?
-
Whenever
she
wants.
I've
got
the
mule.
-
The
room
for
the
night
was
included.
What?
Why
are
you
complaining?
I
didn't
even
-
In
this
time,
who
knows?
I
don't
know
you,
pretty
lady.
-
You
know
what
this
is?
I
never
saw
so
much
money
before!
Here
the
Monkey
arrive!
-
What
are
you
doing
here,
monkey?
-
Looking
for
bread?
Some
wine?
Where
are
your
sons?
-
In
Albania
!
They're
fighting
in
the
war.
Every
one
Of
course.
Look
in
there.
-
Who's
using
this
bicycle,
Vincenzo
?
-
I
use
it.
-
Who
are
they
?
-
People
from
Rome.
They're
spending
the
night
I
gave
them
a
bed.
We're
Christians...
You
know
that
your
sons
are
deserters.
I
say
all
deserters
should
be
shot!
Here's
the
wine.
Now,
let's
drink
to
my
sons
Give
it
to
me.
What's
new
in
Rome,
Signora
?
-
They
are
dropping
bigger
bombs
every
day!
-
We
have
decided
to
get
it
over
with.
here
you
can
eat.
In
Sant'Eufemia,
they
-
That's
where
I
come
from.
They
know
me.
-
You
and
the
girl
could
help
us
out.
What
are
you
saying?
I'm
not
servant.
And
you?
You'd
like
it?
or
would
you
rather
go
starve
-
Keep
that
for
your
sister!
You
tell
who
when
to
talk?
Keep
your
hands
to
yourself,
-
Stay
away
from
her,
or
I'll
smash
your
face!
-
This
woman
deserves
to
be
shot.
-
Put
that
rock
down.
We
could
force
you
to
come
to
headquarters.
I
will
talk
her
into
it,
Monkey.
Rosetta.
Rosetta.
-
Let's
go.
It
will
be
light
any
minute.
Those
men
will
come
back
today.
Rosetta.
Mamma.
Oh,
mamma
mia
!
I
shouldn't
have
showed
them
all
my
money,
With
this,
we
can
go
where
we
want.
-
You've
never
ridden
a
mule,
have
you?
When
I
was
young
I
loved
to
ride
them.
Hey,
where
could
we
get
two
mules
-
I
don't
know.
People
doesn't
move
like
before.
-
My
daughter
had
enough
walking.
-
I
bet
you
anything
they're
on
her
way
to
Rome
again.
Good
bye.
-
You're
not
scared,
are
you?
That
idiot
tried
to
kill
us!
-
But
why,
Mama?
Let's
go.
come
on.
-
We'd
better
go
round
this
way...
-
The
poor
man...
-
You
are
Paride.
-
You
still
need
a
shave.
This
one
made
a
fortune
in
Rome!
Luisa
!
-
With
a
son
on
the
way!
-
Sit
down,
signora.
-
Signora,
this
is
my
niece.
We're
celebrating
a
miserable
day,
Come
here,
Rosetta,
come
here!
She's
my
daughter.
This
air
brings
back
memories.

-
Do
you
understand
me?
It
means:
''Tomorrow
and
the
day
after
tomorrow
-
Where
is
my
aunt?
-
Armando
?
That's
where
I
was
born.
It's
rented,
Signora.
-
Could
you
put
us
up
for
a
month?
I
felt
at
first
it
was
time
to
escape.
Paride,
give
them
the
weaving
shed.
-
Paride,
don't
make
me
beg.
Aren't
we
relatives?
-
I'm
not
going
back
to
Rome,
nor
to
Fondi.
This
morning
-
An
airplane.
It
killed
an
old
man.
-
We
pass
the
time
among
friends
and
we
eat.
-
English
or
German...
who
wins,
wins.
If
the
Germans
win,
I
will
kill
myself.
-
What
have
they
done
to
you
anyway?
-
And
then?
-
So,
enough
politics.
-
What
would
you
like
to
hear?
He
used
to
have
an
orchestra
in
Fondi.
Play
'Vivere''
!
Living...
without
being
jealous...
-
Signora,
you
have
a
store?
-
And
what
a
store!
Everything
can
change
world,
but
not
for
someone
-
People
will
always
need
groceries.
The
Russians
don't
believe
in
business.
-
You
accountants
know
anything!
He
made
a
speech
yesterday.
-
Bombs
killing
women
and
children!
-
You're
the
ones
who
wanted
the
war!
-
If
I...
-
So
what?
-
That
won't
change
anything!
The
harm
is
done.
I'm
not,
if
it
means
stay
here
and
stuffing
my
face
We're
pigs.
That's
what
we
are!
Why
do
you
always
have
to
spoil
everything,
Michele?
-
He's
not
a
bad
boy,
signora.
My
son
should
thank
God
that
I'm
around
to
earn
money!
-
He's
an
idealist.
Let's
play
''Faccetta
Nera''
.
Maybe
I
could
buy
some
food
for
you.
Once
there
was
enough
of
everything
here.
Not
now.
You
can
buy
me
fifty
sacks
of
flour...
You
want
some
split
peas,
beans,
lentils?
-
How
are
the
prices?
A
jar
of
lard
and
some
olive
oil.
-
Who's
got
olive
oil
these
days?
Don't
worry
about
them,
Signora.
-
Why
didn't
they
wash
before
dinner?
when
I
was
young
we
were
worse
off
than
you
are!
-
Your
land
was
poor.
You
sowed
the
field
with
wheat
Papa.
In
a
little
sack
there
are
60
nuts.
Do
I
multiply
or
divide?
Why
ask
your
father?
You
went
to
school,
Do
you
see
this
piece
of
bread?
If
I
want
to
give
one
piece
to
you
and
one
piece
-
Stupid!
-
Your
uncle
will
teach
you
when
he
comes
back.
-
He'll
never
come
back.
-
Those
Russian
women,
they
only
like
foreign
men.
Peppino
will
come
back!
-
He
wants
to
be
near
his
little
girl
-
You
want
some
of
these
carots?
Antonio,
they're
dropping
the
big
lights!
The
big
lights!
Look!
There
they
are!
-
How
lovely,
Mama,
makes
me
feel
like
praying
I
beg
your
pardon,
I
didn't
want
to
offend
you.
It
would
take
more
than
that.
-
They
are
checking
troop
movements.
Isn't
there
some
safe
place
in
the
world?
You
can't
escape.
And
it
is
better
so.
You
see
everything
so
black!
-
Sins,
like
everybody?
Well,
you
might
count
one...
the
day
before
yesterday.
-
you
see?
And
where
do
the
children
come
into
it?
You're
getting
a
real
behind
like
a
woman!
Michele
!
-
Signora,
I
wanted
to...
I
didn't
know,
I'm
sorry.
-
I'm
inviting
you
both
for
a
walk.
-
Ask
the
girl
to
excuse
me.
No,
mamma
!
-
Don't
make
such
a
face.
He
couldn't
have
seen
you.
The
boy's
a
bit
mad.
His
father
spent
a
fortune
-
The
things
he
said
were
true.
If
you
talked
to
me
the
way
he
does
You
should
have
seen
him
run!
We
must
be
nice
to
him.
His
father
has
hams,
pasta,
everything!
I'm
first,
'm
first,
I
won!
-
You're
a
real
mountain
goat!
What's
that
book?
-
What
school
do
you
go
to?
-
In
convents,
you
never
learn
Michele
says
it's
wrong
to
send
me
to
the
convent.
There's
such
a
thing
as
public
school,
She
goes
to
the
best
school
in
Rome.
That's
right,
in
Italy,

more

have

I'm
sorry
but
sometimes
I
have
-
Do
you
ever
go
to
church?
A
few
years
ago,
I
wanted
to
become
a
priest.
-
You
wanted
to
become
a
priest?
-
Why
didn't
you
go
ahead
and
do
it?
Or
rather
that
I
did,
which
is
why
-
Rosetta
!
-
Come
on!
Rosetta's
a
saint.

I'm
not
-
No,
you're
something
better
than
you
think.
A
shopkeeper.
-
What's
wrong
with
selling
things?
-
a
peasant.
-
It
is
one,
nowadays.
The
uncivilized
people
are
in
the
cities
today.
But
peasants
could
begin
again
after
the
war.
What
does
that
mean?
They
are
the
ones
who
could
build
but
that
won't
happen
while
the
others
I'm
sure
you're
wrong,
you'll
never
I
made
a
little
money
because
I
never
trust
anybody.
It
will
bring
you
luck,
here.
Damn
it!
Damn
it,
I
would
give
anything
Don't
you
even
smoke?
No.
-
You
have
a
girl?
-
What's
the
matter?
Didn't
you
ever
have
one?
Today
if
a
man
can't
sacrifice
a
little,
Right,
you
can
do
without
a
lot
of
things
-
Ehi,
little
one,
come
here!
-
What
do
you
want?
-
I
was
asking
were
the
shortcut
to
Sella
is.
It's
Filippo's
son,
the
professor.
In
that
case,
he'll
be
glad
to
hear
what
happened.
I'd
like
to
see
his
face
when
he
hears
it.
-
We'd
better
go.
-
They
have
put
the
Duce
in
prison.
They
put
Mussolini
in
jail,
like
a
thief,
And
what
will
happen
to
Italy
now?
He
was
a
fool,
the
Duce,
for
not
You
don't
need
reason
with
traitors,
Put
that
away,
will
you?
If
it's
really
true,
I
will

happy.
-
No
!
The
Germans
will
show
you
They
will
make
you
lick
dirt
Let's
go
Secretary.
And
you
thank
God
They
are
going,
my
daughter,
look,
you
see.
-
It's
true,
they're
running
away.
But
it's
true.
A
new
life
is
beginning.
-
We
can
go
back
to
Rome.
I'm
going
back,
I'm
going
to
tell
everybody!
You
know
something?
Excuse
me,
Rosetta.
We'll,
I'm
glad
that
they've
liberated
Mussolini,
Just
between
us,
Mussolini,
as
a
man,
I
mean...
-
As
a
man
?
How
can
you
make
love
with
that
man?
all
you
have
to
do
is
switch
off
the
light.
-
What
are
you
laughing
at?
-
I
want
to
know.
-
Signora,
tell
us
what's
so
funny.
-
Aren't
we
playing
cards?
-
I
win!
Come
in.
These
two
are
English.
Their
submarine
brought
them
-
This
is
no
business
of
yours
-
But
the
other
people
can
protest.
-
They
don't
protest,
they
shoot!
You
must
explain
to
them
There
are
many
spies.
If
the
Germans
They'd
take
us
all
to
Germany,
Michele.
-
Yes,
we
must
think
about
our
children.
-
You
can't
always
think
about
yourself.
-
This
way.
-
We
could
give
them
some
bread.
She
wakes
up
hungry
during
the
night,
-
They
go
right
after,
eh?
-
Damn
it,
anyway.
I'm
used
to
it
from
slicing
in

Many
of

hope
that

It
will
change,

It's

You

Show
the

They're

Instead
of
landing
your

How
warm
you
are,
mamma

You
just
keep
going
straight
ahead.
When
I
have
a
drink,
it
goes
right
to
my
head.

Who
is
Giovanni
?

Are
you

No

Do
you

Why?
Can't

We
are
not
at
church,
MicheIe,

whatever
you
want.
Here
you
have
beautiful
stories,
I
read
of
when
Jesus
walks
on
the
sea.
Mama,
come
here,
don't
stand
up.
No,
I
have
to
prepare
the
grass
for
dinner.

Who's
that?
Now
we
have
become
like
goats,
eating
grass.

Please,
read.

''A
man
named
Lazarus

at
Bethany,
the
village
where
Mary
and
her
sister
were
living...''
''Mary
is
that
person
who
anointed
the
Lord's
feet
with
perfume
and
wiped
them
with
her
hair.
-
It
was
her
brother
Lazarus
that
was
ill.
'So
the
sisters
sent
him
this
message:
Jesus
said:
'This
illness
will
not
result
in
death.
No,
it
is
to
promote
the
glory
of
God.
Now
Jesus
loved
Martha

Lazarus...''

Can
you

some
oil?
Stupid,
it
will
become
even
more
expensive.

Signora
Cesira,
here
we
are!
-
We're
going
to
talk
later.
MicheIe,
let's
go
on.
''he
remained
for
two
days
in
the
place
where
he
was.
"Let
us
go
back
to
Judea."
The
disciples
said
to
him:
"Rabbi,

answered,
If
one

day,
he
does
not

tried
to

better
than

They
could

You
are
all
dead,
With
your

with
your
thieves'
scare,
not
even
Jesus

MicheIe
!
-
What's
wrong?
Mama,
was
listening
to
him!
MicheIe's
right.
Please
stop!
What's
wrong?
-
Nothing.
-
We'll
die
by
starvation
for
sure!
You
have
always
to
say
what
is
in
your
heart,
-
I
have
not
the
nerve
to
talk
aloud.
-
I
am
not
sincere
with
you.
Sure,
with
you.
Shoo!
Even
the
goats!
The
gate
is
broken
since
I
went
away.
Let's
go,
it's
raining.
I
love
you,
Cesira.
-
In
such
a
trouble,
do
you
mind
to
that?
You
could
too
give
me
a
smack
in
the
face,
These
stupids
are
here
to
see
the
scene!
-
Don't
you
mind
to
such
a
things?
You
mind,
you
mind.
You
have
someone
in
your
heart.
Only
my
daughter.
-
I've
decided
to
go
back
home,
Rosetta.
-
They
won't
bomb
Rome
anymore.
They'll
start
bombing
here.
How
skinny
you
got.
You
need
more
to
eat.
How
cold
she
is!
-
Mama,
why
doesn't
he
come
anymore,
Michele?
-
He
loves
you,
Michele.
I
can
see
why,
you're
so
beautiful.
He's
25
years
old!
Never
go
with
a
boy
-
But
he's
the
nicest
man
in
Sant'Eufemia.
Damn
draft!
-
You
know
what
I
think
Michele
is?
A
subversive.
Someone
with
a
good
heart
-
We'd
better
give
him
back
his
book.
He
has
no
vices.
If
you
were
a
few
years
older,
-
What
are
you
saying,
mamma!
Listen
to
her
laugh!
