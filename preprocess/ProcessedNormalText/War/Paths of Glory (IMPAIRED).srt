War
began
between
Five
weeks
later,
to
within
18
miles
of
Paris.
There,
the
battered
French
miraculously
-
and
in
a
series
of
unexpected
counterattacks.
-
Drove
the
Germans
back.
The
front
was
stabilized...
then
shortly
afterwards
developed
of
heavily
fortified
trenches...
zigzagging
their
way
500
miles...
from
the
English
Channel
By
1916,
after
two
grisly
years
the
battle
lines
had
changed
very
little.
Successful
attacks
were
measured
and
paid
for
in
lives
General
Broulard,
sir.
-

Paul,
wonderful
seeing
you
again.
Well,
this
is
splendid.
It's
superb.
It's
grand,
very
grand.
Well,
I've
tried
to
create
Well,
you've
succeeded
marvelously.
-
Oh!

You're
much
too
kind,
George.
-
Sit
down,
George.
I
really
haven't
done
very
much.
The
place
Paul,
I've
come
to
see
you
It's
top
secret
and
must
go
no
further
and
not
to
him
Of
course.
A
group
of
armies
is
forming
on
this
front
Headquarters
is
determined
-
Why
are
you
smiling?
I
thought
for
just
a
moment
I
knew
I
never
knew
you
were
a
mind
reader.
-
Something
about
the
"Anthill."
Well,
it
is
a
key
position.
To
be
perfectly
honest,
You
know,
there's
nothing
really
secret
Well,
what
do
you
think?
It's
the
key
to
the
whole
They've
held
on
to
it
for
a
year
now...
and
it
looks
as
though
they'll
hold
on
to
it
Paul,
I
have
formal
orders
That's
the
day
after
tomorrow.
That
comes
pretty
close
to
I
don't
imagine
I'd
be
here

Paul,
if
theres
one
man
in
this
army
It's
out
of
the
question,
George.
My
division
was
cut
to
pieces.
What's
left
of
it
is
in
no
position
I'm
sorry,
but
that's
the
truth.
Well,
Paul,
there
was
something
else
However,
I'm
sure
that
you'll
misunderstand
-
What
was
it?
You'd
be
bound
to
misunderstand.
However,
as
your
friend,
What
are
you
trying
to
say,
George?
Paul,
talk
around
headquarters
is
that
you
-
The
12th
Corps?
Now,
I've
pushed
it
all
I
can.
The
12th
Corps
needs
a
fighting
general,
Now,
we
both
know
for
you
to
refuse
this
assignment
No
one
would
question
your
opinion.
They'd
simply
get
someone
else
So
you
shouldn't
let
this
-
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Have
a
cognac?
George,
I'm
responsible
What
is
my
ambition
against
that?
What
is
my
reputation
My
men
come
first
of
all,
George,
I
know
that
they
do.
You
see,
George,
those
men
know
That
goes
without
saying.
The
life
of
one
of
those
soldiers
than
all
the
stars
and
decorations
So...
you
think
this
attack
is
absolutely
beyond
I
didn't
say
that,
George.
Nothing
is
beyond
those
men,
Paul,
I
don't
want
to
push
you
into
it
Don't
worry,
George.
Of
course,
artillery
would
make
-
What
artillery
support
can
you
give
me?
What
about
replacements?
We'll
see
what
we
can
do,
but
I
feel
sure
-
Might
just
do
it.
I
knew
that
I
was
right
to
come
to
you.
-
Now,
as
far
as
that
star
is
concerned.
-
If
anything,
it
would
sway
me
the
other
way.
Now,
when
do
you
say
No
later
than
the
day
after
tomorrow.
We
just
might
do
it.
Hello
there,
soldier.
-
Yes,
sir.
Sir,
Private
Ferol,
Company
"A."
-
Uh-huh.
Are
you
married,
Private?
-
Well,
I'll
bet
your
mother's
proud
of
you.
-
Well,
carry
on,
Private,
and
good
luck
to
you.
Yes,
sir.
Thank
you,
sir.
-
Good
morning,
General.
Hello
there,
soldier.
-
Yes,
sir.
Well,
that's
the
way.
You
be
good
to
it,
Yes,
sir.

-
Carry
on.

Hello
there,
soldier.
Ready
to
kill
more
Germans?
Well,
is
everything
all
right,
soldier?
All
right?
Yes,
sir,
I'm
all
right.
Aha.
Good
fellow.
-
Married?
Me,
married?
-
Yes.
Have
you
got
a
wife?
Sir,
he's
a
bit
shell-shocked.
I
beg
your
pardon,
Sergeant.
-
Have
you
got
a
wife,
soldier?
My
wife.
Yes,
I
have
a
wife.
I'm
never
gonna
see
her
again.
Get
a
grip
on
yourself!
-
I
am
a
coward,
sir.
Sergeant,
I
want
you
to
arrange
for
the
immediate
I
won't
have
other
brave
men
-
Yes,
sir.
You
were
right,
sir.
This
sort
of
thing
You
know,
General,
have
an
incalculable
effect
In
fact,
I
think
the
fighting
spirit
No,
no,
Major.


The
general
is
coming,
sir.

-
Always
a
pleasure
to
see
you,
Colonel.
It's
our
privilege
entirely.
-
Well,
quite
a
neat
little
spot
you
have
here.
I
reserve
comment
on
the
neatness,
sir,
Pretty
shy
on
seating
accommodations
though.
More
than
enough
for
me.
Like
to
be
on
my
feet.
I
can
vouch
for
that,
Colonel.
I
can
hardly
get
the
general
behind
a
desk
Well,
that's
the
way
I
am,
you
know,
Dax.
I
can't
understand
these
armchair
officers...
fellows
trying
to
fight
a
war
waving
papers
at
the
enemy...
worrying
about
whether
a
mouse
I
don't
know,
General.
If
I
had
the
choice
I
think
I'd
take
the
mice
every
time.
You'll
never
make
me
believe
that,
Colonel.
Seriously
though,
if
a
man's
a
ninny...
let
him
put
on
a
dress
But
if
he
wants
to
be
a
soldier,
He's
got
to
fight,
and
he
can't
do
that
That's
my
credo.
I
think
I
have
to
agree
with
you,

And
you've
never
failed
-
I
imagine
you'd
like
a
look
around,
wouldn't
you?
-

The
Anthill.
About
as
good
a
view


-

Ah.
Yeah.
Well,
I've
seen
Much,
much
worse.
Well,
not
something
we
can
grab
but
certainly
pregnable.
-
Sounds
kind
of
odd,
though,
doesn't
it?
Well,
like
something
to
do

Oh,
yes.
Quite.
You're
right
Even
sharper
than
usual.
But
we
mustn't
forget,
the
colonel
was
perhaps
-
Of
course,
General.
Tell
me,
Colonel,
how
did
your
relief
We
drew
some
artillery.
Yes,
I
noticed
it
on
the
road
in.
Utterly
inexcusable.
Stupid.
All
swarmed
together
like
a
bunch
of
flies,

They
get
in
a
tight
spot
under
heavy
fire,
Herd
instinct,
I
suppose.
Kind
of
a
human
sort
of
thing,
or
don't
you
make
a
distinction
Oh,
yes,
uh,
very
regrettable,
of
course.
Uh,
Major,
would
you
be
kind
enough
Yes,
sir.
Of
course.
Colonel.
-

Well,
Colonel,
what
do
you
think
of
it?
-
What
do
I
think
of
what,
sir?
Colonel,
your
regiment
You
know
the
condition
of
my
men,
sir.
Oh,
naturally,
men
are
going
to
have
to
They
absorb
bullets
and
shrapnel...
and
by
doing
so
make
it
possible
-
What
support
will
we
have?
What
sort
of
casualties
Hmm,
say,
five
percent
killed
That's
a
very
generous
allowance.
Ten
percent
more
and
20%
more
getting
through
the
wire.
That
leaves
65%
Let's
say
another
25%
We're
still
left
with
a
force
General,
you're
saying
that
more
Yes,
it's
a
terrible
price
to
pay,
Colonel...
but
we
will
have
the
Anthill.
-
But
will
we,
sir?
All
France
is
depending
on
you.
Am
I
amusing
you,
Colonel?
I'm
not
a
bull,
General.
I
don't
need
a
flag
I
don't
think
I
like
your
comparison
I
meant
nothing
disrespectful
Patriotism
may
be
old-fashioned,
but
show
me
a
patriot,
and
Not
everyone
has
always
thought
so.
Samuel
Johnson
had
something
else
And
what
was
that,
may
I
ask?
-
Nothing
really.
Well,
sir,
nothing
really
important.
Colonel,
when
I
ask
a
question,
-
Now,
who
was
this
man?
All
right.
Now,
what
did
he
He
said
it
was
the
last
refuge
I'm
sorry.
I
meant
nothing
personal.
You're
tired,
Dax.
You're
very
tired.
It's
you
who
are
exhausted,
not
your
men.
And
it's
my
fault.
I've
given
you
-
You
need
rest.
You
need
it
badly.
And
you
never
would
either.
Therefore,
you're
As
from
right
now,
General,
you
can't
take
You
can't
do
that
to
me,
sir.
Not
to
you,
Dax.
For
you.
The
good
of
my
men,
sir?
If
a
commanding
officer
lacks
confidence,
Naturally,
I
don't
want
to
relieve

Not

We'll
take

Yes,
sir.
Have
it
ready
to
meet
If
those
little
sweethearts
won't
face
I
ordered
an
attack.
Your
troops
refused
to
attack.
Our
troops
did
attack,
sir,
Because
they
didn't
try,
Colonel.
Half
of
your
men
never
left
the
trenches.
A
third
of
my
men
were
pinned
down
Don't
quibble
over
fractions,
Colonel.
The
fact
remains
that
a
good
part
of
your
men
Colonel
Dax,
I'm
going
to
have
10
men
tried
under
penalty
of
death
for
cowardice.
-
Penalty
of
death?
They
have
skimmed
milk
in
their
veins
Then
it's
the
reddest
My
trenches
are
soaked
-
Thats
just
about
enough
out
of
you,
Colonel!
Colonel
Dax,
if
you
continue
in
this
manner,
I
believe
the
colonel
has
a
point,
This
is
not
a
trial,
And
Colonel
Dax,
technically,
In
view
of
the
gravity
of
the
charges...
a
court
of
law
would
grant
him
Latitude
is
one
thing.
I
am
merely
offering
an
opinion,
General.
I
am
perfectly
willing
to
accept
it,
I'm
sorry,
sir.
My
only
aim
is
to
remind
you
on
every
occasion
in
the
past.
We're
not
talking
about
the
past.
But
don't
you
see,
sir?
So
if
some
of
them
didn't
leave
the
trenches,
They
were
ordered
to
attack.
We
can't
leave
it
up
to
the
men
If
it
was
impossible,
would
be
their
dead
bodies
They're
scum,
Colonel.
The
whole
rotten
regiment.
a
pack
of
sneaking,
whining,
-
Do
you
really
believe
that,
sir?
And
what's
more,
-
Then
why
not
shoot
the
entire
regiment?
-
I'm
perfectly
serious.
We
don't
want
to
slaughter
the
French
army.
Oh,
well,
if
it's
an
example
you
want,
-
Take
you?
one
man
will
do
as
well
as
a
hundred.
The
logical
choice
is
the
officer

Come
now,
Colonel.
This
is
not
a
question
of
officers.
Paul,
we
don't
want
to
overdo
this
thing.
Suppose
we
just
make
it
a
dozen.

I
was
talking
of
a
hundred
men,
Paul,
let's
not
haggle
over
this
thing
anymore!
Let's
get
it
settled
once
and
for
all
Well,
perhaps
I
was
a
bit
too
anxious
I've
spent
my
entire
life
in
the
army.
I've
always
tried
to
be
true
to
my
principles.
That's
the
only
mistake
I'll
settle
for
this.
have
the
company
commanders
select
one
man
three
in
all.
Well,
that's
very
reasonable
of
you,
Paul.
The
court-martial
will
meet
-
Will
that
be
convenient
for
you,
General?
You
won't
be
there?
No,
I
think
it
best
-
Probably
so.
If
it's
at
all
possible,
I'd
like
I'll
take
the
matter
into
consideration.
I
think
we
can
permit
that,
can't
we,
Paul?
-
Consider
it
settled,
Colonel.
Well,
noon
straight
up,
Paul.
I
hope
that
you
can
stay
George,
I'm
afraid
the
colonel
Don't
deny
it,
Paul.
You've
been
hiding
I
think
that
was
very
selfish
of
you.
Thank
you
for
your
courtesy,
General,
but
I'm
afraid
there
isn't
Of
course,
Colonel.
I
shall
look
forward

-
Yes,
Captain?
What
is
it?
-
Captain
Rousseau,

commander,
sir.
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
I
haven't
time
to
go
into
it
now.
Report
back
to
your
command
-
Yes,
sir.
-
Bad
stuff.

the
men.
And
the
best
solution
A
court
of
inquiry
Well,
in
cases
like
this.
I.
I
always
try
to
avoid
an
inquiry.
It
gets
around
among
the
men
No,
shelving
will
be
the
best
discipline
-
Well,
perhaps
you're
right.
A
regimental
matter
-
I'll
join
you
in
the
dining
room.
That
will
be
Captain
Sancy,
Yes,
sir.
Have
them
meet
me
at

-
Yes,
sir.
-
Yes,
sir.
Certainly,
sir.
Let's
be
sensible
about
this.
Sensible,
sir?
Listen
to
me,
Dax.
Drop
this
fancy
talk
with
me,
understand?
General
Broulard
seems
to
think
-
Now,
I
want
you
to
drop
this
affair.
Colonel
Dax,
when
this
mess
is
cleaned
up,
I'll
find
an
excuse
and
I'll
break
you
And
it'll
be
just
what
you
deserve...

such
little
loyalty
That's
all,
Colonel.

General

is

gentlemen.

That's
why

But
that

nothing
to

Don't
you
believe
me,
sir?
You've
got
no
witnesses.
Besides,
such
charges
against
an
officer
When
we
get
clear
of
this,
Sir,
in
my
case,
Captain
Renouart
I
was

by

You're
lucky.
Look
at

I

Mr.

Mr.

Will
the

question
the

Please
don't
take
up
the
court's
time
The
indictment
is
lengthy,
The
defense
has
a
right
to
know
The
indictment
is
that
the
accused
showed
during
the
attack
on
the
Anthill.
Proceed,
Mr.
Prosecutor.
Call
the
accused.
Private
Ferol.
-
Private
Ferol.
Were
you
in
the
first
wave
Yes,
sir.
-
Did
you
refuse
to
advance?
-
Did
you
advance?
How
far
did
you
advance?
To
about
the

Then
what
did
you
do?
There
were

bullets
Answer
the
question.
Well,
I
saw
that

and

sir.
I
didn't
ask
you

Yes,
sir.
What
question
was
it?
You
advanced
to
the
middle
of

Then,
sir?
I
went
back,
sir.
In
other
words,
Private
Ferol,
Yes,
sir.
That's
all.
Just
a
minute.
Mr.
President,
I'd
like
-
Proceed,
Colonel.
Now,
Private
Ferol,
when
you
reached
-
were
you
alone
with
Private
Meyer?
Well,
what
happened
to
the
rest
Well,
I
don't
know,
sir.
I
guess
the
rest
of
them
And
you
found
yourself
in
the
middle
Yes,
sir.
Why
didn't
you
attack
the
Anthill

Why
didn't
you
storm
the
Anthill
alone?
Just
me
and
Meyer?
Yes,
I'm
kidding,
Private
Ferol.
Thank
you.
That's
all.
I
don't
see
the
point
Well,
I'm
attempting
to
indicate,
sir...
the
utter
absurdity
of
the
line
of
questioning
Mr.
Prosecutor.
So
you
freely
admit,
Private
Ferol,
Yes,
sir.
Me
and
Meyer
both.
I
knew
we
should've
took
Anthill,

The
accused
may
return
to
his
seat.
Private
Arnaud,
did
you
advance?
Yes,
sir,
until
I
was
ordered
How
far
did
you
advance?
Into
the
wire,
sir.
The,
uh,
enemy
wire,
I
suppose.
No,
sir.
It
was
our
wire.
You
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
didn't
No,
sir,
I
didn't.
How
far
would
you
say
that
was?
Well,
I
advanced
as
far
as
I
could.
How
many
meters?
Not
many.
"Not
many."
Now,
Private
Arnaud,
did
you
urge
your
fellow
soldiers
forward?
Most
of
them
were
dead
or
wounded
before
Reply
to
the
question.
I
didn't
urge
them
on.
No,
sir.
Thank
you.

Arnaud.
At

please.

failure
to

Objection.
That's

company
No,
sir.
Is
it
true
that
you've
been

and

Yes,
sir.

I'd
like
to

out

permission...
I'll
read
citations
for

First,
citations
in

Orders

That's
immaterial,
Colonel.
The
accused
is
not
being
tried
but
for
his
recent
cowardice.
Medals
are
no
defense.
May
I
call
witnesses
to
his
character?
You
may
not.
But
you
may
call
witnesses
to

effect

No,
sir.
Corporal
Paris,
Major
Vignon

shot,
and
he
fell
back
And
were
you
lying
unconscious
Yes,
sir.
That's
all.
Have
you
any
witnesses
to
that?
No,
sir.
I
guess
everybody

there
were
so
many
others
-
But
you
have
no
witnesses.
I
only
have
a

large
cut
That
could
have
been
self-inflicted

you.

may
stand
down.
Mr.
Prosecutor,
Gentlemen
of
the
court...
this
case
speaks
for
itself.

of

And
I
submit
that
that
attack...
was
a
stain
on
the
flag
of
France...
a
blot
on
the
honor...
of
every
man,
woman
and
child
It
is
to
us
that
the
sad,
distressing...
repellant
duty
falls,
gentlemen.
I
ask

court
and
impose
the
penalties
prescribed

you,
Mr.
Prosecutor.
Colonel,
would
you
like

of

court,
to
be
a
member
of
the
human
race...
and
this
is
one
such
occasion.
It's
impossible
for
me
to
summarize
since
the
court
never
allowed
me
Are
you
protesting
Yes,
sir.
I
protest
against
being
prevented
that
I
consider
vital
to
the
defense.
The
prosecution
presented
no
witnesses.

I
protest

Listen,
we

They're

you

an

How
many

They
may
have

Maybe
they're

Anyway,
right

you
take

Of
course,
my
son.
She
won't
understand
this,
I'll
see
that
she
gets
it.
Do
you
want
me
to
hear
your
confession?
Well,
Father,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
I
know
you're
trying
to
help,
but
if
I
started
praying
now,
Oh,
that's
an
error,
my
son.
God
is
always
ready
All
right,
Father.
-
Will
you
please
hear
my
confession
now?
Have
faith
in
your
Creator,
my
son.
Death
comes
to
us
all.
In
the

is

Say,
Ferol,
what's
the
matter?
Well,
look.
This
is.
This
is
my
religion.
O
Great
Bottle,
forgive
me
my
sins,
May
I
drink
of
you
first?
I
understand
your
anguish,
my
son...
but
you
must
not
let
it
May
I
tell
you
something,
Father?

amusing
sign

bar.
It
read,
"Do
not
be
afraid

Come
on,
Arnaud,
sit
down.
You're
drunk.
Come
on.
Come
on,
sit
down.
And
you,
get
out
of
here
What
are
you
hanging
around
for.
-
No.

help
you

power.
-
Come
on,
Arnaud,
take
it
easy.
-
Does
he?
What
a
laugh!
Saved?
I'll
be
saved!
Cut
it
out,
Arnaud!
Arnaud!
Arnaud.
Father,
get
a

That's
a
nasty

advice
is
to
tie
him

Sergeant
Boulanger
said
Yes,
Lieutenant.
Looks
as
if
we
have
a
pretty
unpleasant
thing
-
You
mean
the
execution,
sir.
Yes,
sir.
It's
very
unfortunate.
Oh,
very
unfortunate.
None
of
us
are
happy
about
it,
sir.
How'd
you
happen
to
pick
Corporal
Paris?
-
Well,
I.
I
had
to
pick
somebody,
sir.
Of
course,
you
had
no
personal
motive
Oh,
no,
sir.
You
picked
him
because
-
Well,
did
you
or
didn't
you?

Like
you
say,
-
Oh,
it
was
quite
a
problem,
sir.
I
have
to
pick
someone
to
be
in
charge
Do
you
have
any
objections
-
Me,
sir?
-
Well.

-
Its
just
that
I.

Would
you
like
me
to
open
a
window?
Well,
it's.
Its
just
that
I've
never
been
Oh,
there's
nothing
to
it.
First,
you
help
the
sergeant
Of
course,
you
offer
the
men
blindfolds.
And,
well,
if
they
want
them,
Now,
you.you
take
your
position
you
raise
your
sword.
Then
you
draw
your
revolver
out,
and
put
a
bullet
Sir,
I
request
that
I
be
excused
Request
denied.
-
Colonel,
I.
It's
all
yours.
-
Colonel,
if
you
could
just.
-

-
Excuse
me,
sir.
Colonel
Dax?
My
name
is
Rousseau,
sir,
What
is
it,
Captain?
I
have
something
to
tell
you,
sir,
that
may
Come
in,
Captain.

-
Well,
Colonel,
good
evening.
-
Good
evening.
Come
and
sit
down.
I
am
really
sorry
Not
at
all.
-
Will
you
have
a
cigar?
-
Well,
I.
I
must
apologize
for
not
inviting
you
but
I'm
afraid
that
it's,
uh,
Well,
thank
you,
sir,
but
I
must
confess
Oh,
come,
Dax,
let's
not
Though,
uh,
I
must
admit
that,
the
efforts
of
your
regiment
Now,
how
can
you
understand
that
Oh,
come,
Colonel.
You're
choosing
The
attack
was
impossible
from
the
start.
Colonel
Dax,
we
think
we're
doing
You
must
be
aware
of
the
fact
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
unfair
pressures
Maybe
the
attack
against
the
Anthill
Perhaps
it
was
an
error
of
judgment
On
the
other
hand,
if
your
men
had
been
Who
knows?
In
any
case...
why
should
we
have
to
bear
any
more
Aside
from
the
inescapable
fact
that
a
good
there's
the
question
of
the
troops'
morale.
-
The
troops'
morale?
These
executions
will
be
a
perfect
tonic
There
are
few
things
more
fundamentally
than
seeing
someone
else
die.
-
I
never
thought
of
that,
sir.
Just
as
a
child
wants
his
father
to
be
firm,
I
see.
And
one
way
to
maintain
discipline
May
I
ask...
do
you
sincerely
believe
It's
been
a
pleasure
but
I'm
afraid
that
I'd
better
Forgive
me
for
having
kept
you
Oh,
by
the
way,
sir,

his
own
battery
commander,
to
open
fire
on
his
own
positions

Well,
of
course
the
captain
refused
but
General
Mireau
demanded
that
he
Again
Rousseau
refused
but
again
he
was
ordered,
all
in
front
of
witnesses.
Do
you
actually
believe

are
copies
of
the
sworn
statements
Battery
Commander
Rousseau,
the
telephone
clerk
and,
uh,
What
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
the
charge
A
general
in
a
tantrum
over
the
failure
orders
his
artillery
to
fire
on
his
own
men.
Now,
this
same
officer
on
the
same
day...
orders
a
court-martial
in
which
General,
what
would
your,
uh,
newspapers
Colonel
Dax,
are
you
trying
Sir,
that's
an
ugly
word,
Too
much
has
happened.
The
only
question
is
who.
General
Mireau's
assault
and
his
order
to
fire
on
this
own
troops
But
his
attempt
to
murder
to
protect
his
own
reputation
Will
you
pardon
me,
Colonel
Dax?
I've
been
rude
to
my
guests
too
long.

morning,

are
you
today?
How
are
you?
You
missed
some
good
chow
What'd
you
have?
Have
you
got
a
drink
for
us?
Take
a
swig
of
this.

It
just
occurred
to
me.
I
haven't
had
one
sexual
thought

Are
you
listening
to
me?
There
will
be
a

dignitaries,
You've
got
a
wife
and

I
don't
wanna
die.
Many
of
us
will
be
joining
you
I
don't
care.

I
can't
save
you.
No
one
can
now.
This
is
the
last
decision
You
can
pull
yourself
together,
act
like
a
man,
In
the
end,
it'll
all
be
the
same.

Well,
let's
get
busy.
It's
no

around
here.

Why?
We
do
not

But
I
fought.
I
fought.
I
fought
on
the
battlefield.
Why
don't
they
die?
You
showed
courage
Show
it
now
before
your
own
troops.
But
I'm
scared.
I'm
scared.
Oh,
Father,
I'm
scared.
Oh,
my
God.
Courage.
Brace
yourself,

straight,
