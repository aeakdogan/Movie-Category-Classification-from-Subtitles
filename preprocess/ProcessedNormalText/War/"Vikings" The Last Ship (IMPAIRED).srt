His

Thorhall.
He
has
come
with
a
story.
I'm
listening.
I
went
on
a
raiding
party
with
Earl
Gunnar
Asgrimsson.
We
fought
against
the
armies
of

years

that

can

would

know
where
Ragnar
is.
He
left
soon
after
his
defeat
in
Paris.
We
haven't
seen
him
in
years.
Forgive
me
asking,
but
how
can
such
a
man

disappear?

to

UBBE:
Ivar.
Wake
up.

is
here.
UBBE:

never

BJORN:

would
have

That
is
why
he
didn't
tell
them.
-
What
do
you
mean?
They
were
dead!
Ragnar
wanted
to
sail
to
Paris.
He
wanted
to
be
famous.
Isn't
that
more
important?
Hmm?
You
could
say
that?
I
can
say
that?
-
What
does
that
mean?
at
least
to
me.
Our
father
abandoned
us.
We
were
just
kids
and
he
ran
off.
Only
the
gods
know
if
he's
still
alive.
And
now
we
hear
he
kept

he

or

he'd
told
them,
If
it's

If
it's
true
that

lied

he
never
comes
back.
He
betrayed
our
name.
HVITSERK:
If
he
ever
came
back,
I
would
kill
him.

Me
too.
Screw
you!
-

He
never
did
anything
wrong.
He
is
our
father.
And
that
is
the
end
of
it.

What
do
you
say,

What
shall
we

it
exists.

How
can

learned
from

The

way
to
tell

...is
to

there.
I
hope
you'll
come
with
me,
Floki.
Are
you
joking?
The
lure
of
an
imaginary
land.
Traveling
somewhere
that
doesn't
exist.
Of
course
I'm
coming.

And
I
hope
you'll
come
too,
Helga.
Well,
if
Floki
is
mad
enough
to
go,
then
I
guess
I
will
follow.







Let
us
pass.
Move.
Hello,
Ivar.
There's
no
mistaking
you.

It
appears
my
return
is
not
welcome.
You've
obviously
all
made
I
cannot
blame
you
for
that.

So.
Well,
boys,
who
is
going
to
do
it,
then?
Who's
going
to
kill
me?
Well,
I
don't
mind.
Go
ahead.
Please.
What
about
you,
Hvitserk?
You
think
you're
a
man
now?
I
dare
you.
Put
me
out
of
my
misery.
Do
it.
Do
it.
Do
it,
do
it.

Do
it!

Look
at
these
people!
They
no
longer
support
me!
Look!
Why
would
they?
I
am
your
leader,
and
I
just
left!
What
kind
of
leader
does
that,
huh?

What
kind
of
What
kind
of
father
abandons
his
sons?
So,
who
wants
to
be
king?

Oh,
you
know
how
this
works!
If
you
want
to
be
king,
you
must
kill
me.
Take
it.
No?
You?
No?
What
about
you?
No?
Anyone?
Who
wants
to
be
king?
