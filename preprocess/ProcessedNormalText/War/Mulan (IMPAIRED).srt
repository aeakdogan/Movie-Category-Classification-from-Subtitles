Yep,

Present.
Oops.
Who
spit
in
her
bean
curd?
Huh.
Hmm.
Mmm.
Too
skinny.
Hmph!
Not
good
for
bearing
sons.
Recite
the
final
admonition.
-

-
Well?
Fulfill
your
duties
calmly
and...
Um,
reflect
before
you
snack...
Act!
This
shall
bring
you

Hmm.
This
way.
Now,
pour
the
tea.
To
please
your
future
in-laws,
you
must
demonstrate
...and
refinement.
You
must
also
be
poised.

Um,
pardon
me.
And
silent!

Ahhh.
-
Could
I
just
take
that
back?
-
One
moment.
-

-

Aaah!
Whoo!
Aaah!
-



I
think
it's
going
well,
don't
you?
Put
it
out!
Put
it
out!
Put
it
out!

You
are
a
disgrace!
You
may
look
like
a
bride,
but
you
will
never



#
Look
at
me
#
I
will
never
pass
#
For
a
perfect
bride
#
Or
a
perfect
daughter
#
Can
it
be
#
I'm
not
meant
to
play
this
part
#
Now
I
see
#
That
if
I
were
truly
to
be
myself
#
I
would
break
my
family's
heart
#
Who
is
that
girl
I
see
#
Staring
straight
#
Back
at
me
#
Why
is
my
reflection
#
Someone
I
don't
know
#
Somehow
I
cannot
hide
#
Who
I
am
#
Though
I've
tried
#
When
will
my
reflection
show
#
Who
I
am
inside
#
When
will
my
reflection
show
#
Who
I
am
#
Inside
#

My,
my.
What
beautiful
blossoms
But
look.
But
I'll
bet
that
when
it
blooms,
it
will
be
the
most
beautiful
of
all.

What
is
it?
Mulan.
Stay
inside.
-

Citizens,
I
bring
a
proclamation
from
the
imperial
city.
The
Huns
have
invaded
China.

By
order
of
the
emperor,
one
man
from
every
family
The
Hsiao
family.
The
Yi
family.
I
will
serve
the
emperor
The
Fa
family.
No!
I
am
ready
to
serve
the
emperor.
-
Father,
you
can't
go.
Please,
sir,
my
father
Silence!
You
would
do
well
to
hold
her
tongue
in
a
man's
presence.
Mulan,
you
dishonor
me.
Report
tomorrow
Yes,
sir.

The
Chu
family!
The
Wen
family!
The
Chang
family!







-
You
shouldn't
have
to
go!
There
are
plenty
of
young
men
It
is
an
honor
to
protect
So,
you'll
die
for
honor.
I
will
die
doing
what's
right.
-
But
if
you...
It
is
time
you
learned
yours.









Mulan
is
gone!
What?
It
can't
be.
Mulan!

No.
You
must
go
after
her.
If
I
reveal
her,
she
will
be.
Ancestors,
hear
our
prayer.
Watch
over
Mulan.

Mushu,
awaken!

I
live!
So,
tell
me
what
mortal
needs
-
Just
say
the
word
and
I'm
there.
Let
me
say
somethin'.
Anybody
who's
vengeance
will
be
mine!

Mushu!
These
are
the
family
guardians.
They...
protect
the
family.
And
you,
o
demoted
one?
I...
ring
the
gong.
That's
right.

One
family
reunion
Okay,
people,
look
alive.
Let's
move
it.
Rise
and
shine.
Y'all
way
past
the
beauty
sleep
thing,

I
knew
it.
I
knew
it!
That
Mulan
was
a
troublemaker
Don't
look
at
me.
She
gets
it
She's
trying
to
help
her
father.
If
she's
discovered,
Dishonor
will
come
to
the
family.
-
Not
to
mention,
they'll
lose
the
farm.
-
They
all
became
acupuncturists.
No!
Your
great-granddaughter

-
Let
a
guardian
bring
her
back.
No,
the
swiftest.
-
No,
send
the
wisest.
We
must
send

Okay,
okay,
I
get
the
drift.

Y'all
don't
think
I
can
do
it.
Aha!
Jump
back.
Don't
make
me
singe
nobody
You
had
your
chance
Your
misguidance
Yeah,
thanks
a
lot.
And
your
point
is?
The
point
is
we
will
be
sending
What?
What?
You
are
not
worthy
of
this
spot.
Now,
awaken
the
great
stone
dragon.
So
you'll
get
back
to
me

Just
one
chance.
It's
not
like
it'll
kill
ya.
Yo,
Rocky,
wake
up!
Ya
gotta
go
fetch
Mulan!
Come
on,
boy!

Come
on.

Hello?
Hel-lo!
Hello!
Uh-oh.
Uh,
Stony?
Stony?
Oh,
man,
they're
gonna
kill
me.

Great
stone
dragon,
have
you
awakened?

Uh,
uh,
uh,
uh...
I'm...
I
am
the
great
stone
dragon.
I
will
go
forth
and
fetch
Mulan.
Did...
Did
I
mention
that
Go!
The
fate
of
the
Fa
family
rests
in
your
claws.
Don't
even
worry
about
it.

Oh.
My
elbow!

I
know
I
twisted
somethin'.

That's
just
great.
I'm
doomed,
and
all
'cause
Miss
Man
decides
to
take
her

Go
get
her?
After
this
great
stone,
I'd
have
to
bring
her
home
with
That's
it!
They'll
be
begging
me
That's
the
master
plan.


Hey,
what
makes
you

You're
lucky?

-
Do
I
look
like
a
sucker
to
you?
What
you
mean,
"a
loser"?
How
'bout
I
pop
-
Then
who's
the
loser?



Lmperial
scouts.
Shan-Yu.

Nice
work,
gentlemen.

The
emperor
will
stop
you.
Stop
me?
He
invited
me.
-

By
building
his
wall,
Well,
I'm
here
to
play
his
game.
Go!
Tell
your
emperor
I'm
ready.
How
many
men
does
it
take
One.
Okay,
okay,
how
about
this?

Where
do
I
sign
in?
Ha,
I
see
you
have
a
sword.
They're
very
manly
and...
tough.

I'm
working
on
it!
Oh.
Who
am
I
fooling?
It's
going
to
take
a
miracle
Did
I
hear
someone
-
Let
me
hear
you
say
"aaah"!
-
That's
close
enough.
Get
ready,
Mulan.
For
I
have
been
sent
to
guide
you
through
If
you're
gonna
stay,
So
heed
my
word!
'Cause
if
the
army
the
penalty
is
death!
Who
are
you?
Who
am
I?
Who
am
I?
I
am
the
guardian
of
lost
souls.
I
am
the
powerful,
the
indestructible
Mushu.
Oh.
Ha,
ha.

Uh,
my
ancestors
sent
Hey,
dragon,
dragon,
not
lizard.
I
don't
do
that
tongue
thing.
You're,
um...
Intimidating?
-
Tiny.
I'm
travel-size
If
I
was
my
real
size,
your
cow
Down,
Bessie.
My
powers
are
For
instance,
my
eyes
can
see
All
right,
that's
it!
Dishonor!
Dishonor
on
your
whole
family.
Make
a
note
of
this.
Dishonor
on
you,
Stop.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
just
nervous.
Then
you're
gonna
have
to
trust
me.
We
clear
on
that?
Let's
get
this
show
on
the
road!
-
Let's
move
it,
heifer.


Okay,
this
is
it.
Shoulders
back,
chest
high,
Two,
three.
Break
it
down.
-
Beautiful,
isn't
it?
No,
they're
men.
You
have
to
Look.
Hmm.
-

I
hope
you
can
get
your
money
back!
I
don't
think
I
can
do
this.
It's
all
attitude.
-

Punch
him.
Oh,
Yao,
you've
made
a
friend.
Good.
Slap
him
on
the
behind.
Whoa-ho-ho!
I'm
gonna
hit
you
so
hard,
-
Yao,
relax
and
chant
with
me.


-

Yeah.
Ahh,
you
ain't
worth
my
time.
-
Chicken
boy.
Say
that
to
my
face,
ya
limp
noodle!

Oh.
Sorry,
Ling.
Hey!
Whoa!
You're
dead!
Oh,
there
he
goes!
-




Hey,
guys.
The
Huns
have
struck
here,
I
will
take
the
main
troops
and
stop
Shan-Yu
before
Excellent
strategy,
sir.
I
do
love
surprises.

You
will
stay
and
train
When
Chi
Fu
you
will
join
us,
Captain.
Captain?

This
is
an
enormous
Perhaps
a
soldier
Number
one
in
his
class,
extensive
knowledge
an
impressive
military
lineage.
I
believe
Li
Shang
Oh,
I
will.
I
won't
let
you
down.
-
Yes,
sir.
We'll
toast
China's
victory
I'll
expect
a
full
report
And
I
won't
leave
anything
out.
Captain
Li
Shang.
Hmm.

Leader
of
China's
finest
troops.
No.
The
greatest
troops
of
all
time.


Most
impressive.

Good
luck,
Father.


Day
one.
Soldiers!

He
started
it!
I
don't
need
anyone
Sorry.
Uh...

I
mean,
uh...
But
you
know
how
it
is
when
and
you
just
gotta
kill
something,

Fix
things,
cook
outdoors...
-
What's
your
name?
Your
commanding
officer
Uh,
I've
got
a
name.
-
Ling.
How
'bout
Ling?
I
didn't
ask
for
his
name.
-
Try,
uh,
uh,
ah,
Chu.
-
Ah
Chu?
Ha,
ha.
I
kill
myself.
-
Mushu.
-
No.
Ping
was
my
best
friend
growin'
up.
-
It's
Ping.
Of
course,
Ping
did
steal
my...
Yes,
my
name
is
Ping.
Let
me
see
-
Fa
Zhou?
The
Fa
Zhou?
Um,
he
doesn't
talk
about
me
much.

I
can
see
why.

Okay,
gentlemen,
you'll
spend
tonight
picking
up

And
tomorrow,
the
real
work
begins.

You
know,
we
have
to
work



Rise
and
shine,
sleeping
beauty.
-
Come
on.
Hup,
hup,
hup.

Get
your
clothes
on.
Look,
you
get
porridge,
Hey,
get
outta
there!
-
Am
I
late?
It's
your
first
day
of
training.
Play
nice,
unless
one
of
the
other
kids
Then
you
have
to
kick
I
don't
wanna
kick
Don't
talk
with
your
mouth
full.
I
think
my
bunny
slippers
Come
on!
Scare
me,
girl.
-

That's
my
tough-lookin'
warrior.


-
The
troops
just
left?

Wait!
You
forgot
your
sword.
My
little
baby,


Order.
People,
order.
-
I'd
like
a
pan-fried
noodle.
-
Moo
goo
gai
pan.

Looks
like
our
new
friend
Hello,
Ping.
Yeah,
'cause
I
owe
you
-

You
will
assemble
swiftly
Anyone
who
acts
otherwise
will
answer
to
me.
Ooh.
Tough
guy.
Yao.
Thank
you
for
volunteering.

I'll
get
that
arrow,
pretty
boy,
and
I'll
do
it
with
my
shirt
on.
One
moment.
This
represents
discipline,
and
this
represents
strength.
You
need
both
to
reach
the
arrow.


We've
got
a
long
way
to
go.

you?
Just
because
I
look
like
a
man
So
a
couple
of
guys
Picky,
picky,
picky.
Well,
myself,
I
kind
of
like
-
Ahhh.
Get
out
before
you
Mushu,
if
you're
so
worried,

Yeah,
yeah.
while
I
blow
our
secret
-
Pfft!
Hygiene!
-

Me
first!
Me
first!
We're
doomed!
There
are
a
couple
of
things


-
Whooo-ooo!

Hey,
Ping!
Oh,
hi,
guys.
I
was
just
washing.
So
now
I'm
Come
back
here.
I
know
we
were
jerks
to
you
before,
so
let's
start
over.
-
Hi.
I'm
Ling.
-
And
I'm
Chien-Po.
And
I
am
Yao!
King
of
the
rock!
And
there's
nothin'
Oh,
yeah?
Well,
I
think
Ping
I
really
don't
wanna
Ping,
we
have
to
fight!
No,
we
don't.
We
could
just
close
-
Come
on.
Don't
be
such
a
gir...
Ouch!
Something
bit
me!

What
a
nasty
flavor.
Snake!

-


Oooh,
snake!
Snake!
-
Snake!
Snake!
Some
king
of
the
rock.
Aah!
Boy,
that
was
close.
No.
That
was
vile.
You
owe
me
big.
I
never
want
to
see
a
naked
man
again.


Hey,
don't
look
at
me.
I
ain't
bitin'
no
more
butts.

You
think
your
troops
Ha!
They
would
not
last
They
completed
their
training.
Those
boys
are
no
more
fit
than
you
are
to
be
captain.
Once
the
general
reads
my
report,
your
troops
will
never
see
battle.
Oh,
no,
you
don't!
I've
worked
too
hard
This
guy's
messin'
with
my
plan.
We're
not
finished!
Be
careful,
Captain.
The
general
may
be
your
father,
but
I
am
the
emperor's
counsel.

And,
oh,
by
the
way,
I
got
that
job
on
my
own.
You're
dismissed.
Hey.
I'll
hold
him,
and
you
punch.

Or
not.
For
what
it's
worth,
-
I
saw
that.
You
like
him,
don't
you?
-
No!
I...
Go
to
your
tent!
I
think
it's
time
we
took
this
war
I
think
it's
time
we
took
this
war
into
our
own
hands.

Let
me
see
what
you
got.
"From
General
Li.
Dear
son,
It
would
mean
a
lot
That's
great.
Except
you
forgot,
perhaps
you
wouldn't
mind
Hello!
This
is
the
army!
Know
what
I'm
talkin'
about?


That's
better.
Khanny,
baby.



Insubordinate
ruffians!
You
men
owe
me

And
I
do
not
squeal
like
a
girl.
Urgent
news
from
the
general.
What's
the
matter?
You've
never
Who
are
you?
Excuse
me?
We're
in
a
war,
man!
I
should
have
your
hat
for
that.
But
I'm
feeling
gracious
today,
Captain,
urgent
news
We're
needed
at
the
front.
Pack
your
bags,
Cri-Kee.
Pack
your
bags,
Cri-Kee.

#
For
a
long
time
#
In
our
thundering
herd

#
Like
a
pounding
beat
our
aching
feet
#
Aren't
easy
to
ignore
#
Hey!
Think
of
instead
#
A
girl
worth
fighting
for
-
Huh?
#
A
girl
worth
fighting
for
#
I
want
her
paler
than
the
moon
#
With
eyes
that
shine
like
stars

#
My
girl
will
marvel
#
Adore
my
battle
scars

#
I
couldn't
care
less
#
Or
what
she
looks
like
#
It
all
depends
on
what
she
cooks
like
#
Beef,
pork,
chicken,
mmm
#
Bet
the
local
girls
thought
#
And
I'll
bet
the
ladies

#
You
can
guess
-
#
Since
we
went
off
to
war
-

#
What
do
we
want
#
My
girl
will
think
I
have
no
faults
#
That
I'm
a
major
find
#
Uh,
how
'bout
a
girl
who's
got
a
brain
-
#
Who
always
speaks
her
mind
#
My
manly
ways
and
turn
of
phrase
#
Are
sure
to
thrill
her
#
He
thinks
he's
such
a
lady-killer
#
I've
a
girl
back
home
#
Yeah,
the
only
girl

#
But
when
we
come
home
#
They'll
line
up
at
the
door
-
#
What
do
we
want
#
Wish
that
I
had
#
A
girl
worth
fighting
for
-
#


Search
for
survivors.
-


I
don't
understand.
Captain!
The
general.
I'm
sorry.

-

We'll
make
better
time
through
the
Tung
Shao
Pass.
We're
the
only
hope
Move
out!



-

-
Um...
-

-
Get
out
of
range!
Aah!
-

-


Hey!
Oh,
sure.
Fire!


Fire!
Hold
the
last
cannon.


Prepare
to
fight.
If
we
die,
we
die
with
honor.

Yao,
aim
the
cannon
at
Shan-Yu.
-

Hey!
-
Ping!
Stop!
You
might
want
-
Quickly.
Quickly!
Come
on!
-

How
could
you
miss?

-


-





Mulan!
Mulan!
-
Mulan?
No.
Mulan!
Man,
you
are
one
lucky
bug.

Shang!
-
Do
you
see
them?
Perfect.
Hey,
Mulan!
We
need
help.
Ooh,
nice.
Very
nice.
Aah!

We're
gonna
die!
No
way
we
survive
this.

I
let
them
-
Aah!
Pull!

Whoa!
Huh?
I
knew
we
could
do
it.
Well,
sort
of.

Step
back,
guys.

Ping?

You
are
the
craziest
man
And
for
that,
I
owe
you
my
life.
From
now
on,
Let's
hear
it
for
Ping!
-
You're
king
of
the
mountain!
-

Ping!
What's
wrong?

He's
wounded!
Get
help!
-

Hold
on.
Hold
on.

I
can
explain.

So
it's
true!

Shang!
I
knew
there
was
-
A
woman!
-

My
name
is
Mulan.
-
I
did
it
to
save
my
father.
I
didn't
mean
for
it
to
go
this
far.
Ultimate
dishonor!
It
was
the
only
way.

Captain?
-

Restrain
him!
-

No!
A
life
for
a
life.
My
debt
is
repaid.
-
Move
out!
I
said
move
out.



I
was
this
close.
This
close
to
impressin'
the
ancestors,
gettin'
the
top
shelf,
an
entourage.
Man.
All
my
fine
work.
Pfft.
Hi.
I
should
never
have
left
home.
Hey,
come
on.
Who
knew
you'd
end
up
shamin'
him,
and
losin'
all
your
friends?
you
gotta
learn

Maybe
I
didn't
go
for
my
father.
Maybe
what
I
really
wanted
was
to
prove
I
could
do
things
right.
So
when
I
looked
in
the
mirror,
I'd
see
someone
worthwhile.
But
I
was
wrong.
I
see
nothing.
That's
just
'cause
this
needs

Let
me
shine
this
up
for
ya.
I
can
see
you.
Look
at
you.
The
truth
is,
we're
both
frauds.
Your
ancestors
never
sent
me.
I
mean,
you
risked
your
life
I
risked
your
life
to
help
myself.
At
least
you
had
good
intentions.

What?
What
do
you
mean
-
You
lied
to
me?
And
what
are
you,
a
sheep?
-

I'll
have
to
face
my
father
Let's
go
home.
Yeah.
This
ain't
gonna
be
pretty.
But
don't
you
worry,
okay?
We
started
this
thing
together,
I
promise.




-






Uh,
home
is
that
way.
-
I
have
to
do
something.
They
popped
out
of
the
snow!
Are
we
in
this
together
or
not?

Well,
let's
go
kick
some
Hunny
buns!
Yee-haw!


Make
way
for
the
heroes
of
China.
-
Shang!
The
Huns
are
alive!
You
don't
belong
here,
Mulan.
I
saw
them
in
the
mountains.
Why
should
I?
-

You
said
you'd
trust
Ping.
Keep
your
eyes
open.
-

To
find
someone
My
children,
upon
the
Middle
Kingdom.
China
will
sleep
safely
tonight
thanks
to
our
brave
warriors.

-
Sir,
the
emperor's
in
danger.
But
the
Huns
are
here.
-
Please,
you
have
to
help.
No
one
will
listen.
Huh?
I'm
sorry.
-
Mushu.
Your
Majesty,
I
present
to
you
I
know
what
this
means
to
you,
Your
father
would
have
been
very
proud.


-



-
No!


They'll
never
reach
the
emperor
in
time.


Hey,
guys!
I've
got
an
idea.
#
Be
a
man
#
We
must
be
swift
as
a
coursing
river
#
Be
a
man
#
With
all
the
force
of
a
great
typhoon
#
Be
a
man
#
With
all
the
strength
of
a
raging
fire
#
Mysterious
as
the
dark
side

Boo.
Guard
the
door.
Your
walls
and
armies
have
fallen,
and
now
it's
your
turn.
Bow
to
me.
Okay.
Any
questions?

Does
this
dress
make
me
look
fat?
-

-


-
Concubines.
Oh,
he's
so
cute!
Ohh...


Now,
that's
what
I
call

Shang,
go!
I
tire
of
your
arrogance,
old
man.
I
tire
of
your
arrogance,
old
man.
No
matter
how
the
wind
howls,
Then
you
will
kneel
in
pieces!
Chien-Po,
get
the
emperor!
Sorry,
Your
Majesty.

No!
Come
on!



No.

You!
You
took
away
my
victory!

No!
I
did.
The
soldier
from
the
mountains.

-

-
Um...
Hey,
I'm
making
this
up
as
I...
go.
-
Mushu!
Come
on,
Cri-Kee.


-
Citizens,
I
need
firepower.
Your
worst
nightmare!
-
On
the
roof!

It
looks
like
you're
out
of
ideas.
Not
quite.
Ready,
Mushu?
I
am
ready,
baby!

Huh?


Get
off
the
roof,
get
off
the
roof,


-
You
are
a
lucky
bug.

That
was
a
deliberate
attempt
Where
is
she?
What
a
mess!
That
creature's
not
worth
protecting.
-
She's
a
hero.
-
She'll
never
be
worth
anything.
That
is
enough.
Your
Majesty,
I
can
explain.
I've
heard
a
great
deal
about
you,
You
stole
your
father's
armor,
ran
away
from
home,
impersonated
a
soldier,
deceived
your
commanding
officer,
dishonored
the
Chinese
army,
and...
you
have
saved
us
all.
Ah!
Ooh!

My
little
baby
is
all
grown
up
You
have
a
tissue?
-
Chi
Fu.
See
to
it
that
this
woman
Member...
what?
There
are
no
council
positions
open,
Very
well.
What?
I...
Oh.
With
all
due
respect,
I
think
I've
been
away
Then...
take
this,
so
your
family
will
know
And
this,
so
the
world
will
know

Is
she
allowed
to
do
that?

Um...
you...
You
fight
good.
Oh.
Thank
you.

Khan,
let's
go
home.


The
flower
that
blooms
in
adversity
is
the
most
rare
and
beautiful
of
all.
Sir?
You
don't
meet
a
girl
Mulan!
Father,
I
brought
you
And
the
crest
of
the
emperor.
They're
gifts,
The
greatest
gift
and
honor
I've
missed
you
so.
I've
missed
you,
too,
Baba.

me,

me.
Does

here?
Thank
you.
Whoo!

me
up
for
the
next
war!

W-well,

Would

would
be
great.
Come
