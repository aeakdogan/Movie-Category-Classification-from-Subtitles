All
he

him
You
should
have
told
him,
You

how
to
work
Yes,
sir.
Then

Cover

It's
Coffman.

So
I
pulled
him
I
gave
him--
I
gave
him
For
what?
This
is
Andy!
Was
it
you
who
said
the
Nips
All
right,
we
learned
Don't
waste
time
saying
Question
is,
Where?
Sir,
if
my
memory
the
rocket
is
designed
primarily
to
fire
Therefore,
my
guess
are
located
on
the
reverse
Sergeant
Dickerman,
I'm
well
aware
of
what
For
hours
we've
been
pounding
with
everything
we've
got.
So
far
we
haven't
Why?
Where
are
they?!
Does
the
colonel
I
sent
out
a
patrol
They
killed
Nips
When
are
these
men
the
importance
You
can't
teach
men
then
suddenly
We
teach
them
Colonel,
may
I
suggest
that
with
the
right
kind
Sergeant
Dickerman,
as
a
combat
Yes,
sir.
And
since
this
is
I
suggest
you
Don't
worry
yourself
that
don't
concern
you.
Sir,
I'm
concerned
This
war
is
as
much
We
did
get
one
Nip,
Charlie
company
found
him
wandering
around
What's
the
scoop
on
him?
I
passed
the
word
on
and
they
said
for
us
SergeantJohnson's
outside
See
what
he's
found
out.
Now,
rockets
we've
been
ordered
It's
025
5
now.
We
jump
off
at
1
200.
That's
exactly
9
hours
Any
comments?
If
we
try
to
take
the
whole
battalion
Unless
we
find
a
way
to
The
general
made
this
and
we're
gonna
see
or
you--
He'll
be
right
in,
Johnson.
Yes,
sir.
Well,
any
resemblance
to
a
marine
uniform
is--
You're
impossible!
Yes,
sir.
The
colonel
knows
to
let
war
interfere
Get
rid
of
that
The
colonel
knows
it's
What
about
the
Nip?
The
Nip
was
in
a
cave
cut
off
by
our
artillery
bypassed
by
us.
Last
night
he
tried
to
make
but
ran
into
He
says
the
men
he
left
Have
been
commanded
to
hold
