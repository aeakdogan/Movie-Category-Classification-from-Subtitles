my
ancestors
have
known
A
man
like
beast
Like
us,
Taku
He
hunted,
taking
only
what
he
needed.
But
when
the
white
man
came
killing
many
animals,
Taku
He
were
deeply
angry
In
revenge,
the
white
men
spilled
It
was
a
time
Even
today,
it
is
we
There
are
even
those

What
the
hell
I've
seen
somethin'

Now,
that's
how
you
kill
You
idiots
In
case
you
don't
remember,
Spread
out.
We
only
got






What

You
can't
punish
him




Your
endangered
the
Monday

I
don't
make
up
the
curricula.
Now,
for
those
who
have
yet
just
remember,
Seeing
as
that
you
perhaps
you'd
like
to
give
us


Mr.
Kelter!
Uhm,
uh...
Shea.

Did
you
hear
the
question?
Yeah.
You
were
talking
about
It
just
kinda
looks
to
me
are
becoming
After
class,
Kelter,
Mr.
Winslow,
Uh.
Woodland
caribou,
short-tailed
albatross,
white-tailed
deer,
Uh,
sea
otter,
The
Sasquatch.

you
could
just
Why

you
join
Mr.
Vancamp,
A
bunch
of
guys
got

or
something.


Well,
enjoy
your
spring
break
and
please,
please,
Jay!
Sorry.
Just
like
you
forgot
Listen,
you're
precariously
close
That
means
What
are
you
talking
about?
Mr.
Kelter,
graduation
is
a
privilege,
That's
why
I've
decided
What?
Why?
You're
joking,
right?
"He
who
helps
others,
I
don't
need
his
help.
I
can't
help.
Gentlemen,
let
me
If
the
two
of
you
together
don't
produce
an
in-depth
presentation
one
of

Bear
attack?
Gotta
get
this
You
have
to
get
Tourists

gonna
be
up
here
It's
all
bull
hairs.
They'll
think
We
gotta
control
this
I've
called
the
town
meeting
Calling
meetings,
Kassel?
That'll
add
fuel
We
cant
let
this
get
out.
I
understand
that
my
job
They
have
the
right
to
know
You
don't
know
that,
yet.
If
I
read
one
word
about
this
you're
gonna
have
a
tough
time
What's
that,
John?
Nothing.
Maybe
all-knowing
Indian
What
do
you
think
It's
a
noble
savage.
It's
nice
of
you
Listen,
we've
contacted
He'll
be
here
Until
then,
I
don't
give
a
rat's
ass
You
just
make
sure
this
thing
Johnson!
Don't
get
too
far
ahead
of
us
You
don't
really
think
You
ever
heard
of
a
bear
Well,
it's
what
Janzer
claims.
Well,
the
poacher
claims
Let's
call
it
that.
Better
than
what?
Listen,
don't
answer
that.
My
only
job
Unfortunately,
those
people
I'm
sure
those
yahoos
Listen,
I'll
head
I
give
you
two
days.
But
take
care
of
you,
John.
For
God's
sakes,
I
don't
wanna
have




Jesus,
man!
What's
up?
That's
a
really
nice
bike
My
sister's
got
a
tutu
I
hope
it's
pretty.
Look,
I
ain't
going
back
here
You
and
I
We
don't
have
We
just
have
Unless
you
get
an
incomplete,
Why
is
that,
Jay?
Because
you
said
yourself
It's
grizzlies.
Okay,
whatever,
Just
be
there,
right?

Oh,
yeah.
my
cousin
Jenny,
Don't
ask
me
why.
She's
gonna
be
there



Jenny,
Richard.
You're
the
one
What?
No.
Jenny
wants
to
come
but
I
told
her
I
didn't
think
That
wouldn't
be.
Why?
I
can
handle
it
Can
you
hear
me?
Good
evening.
Uh...the
Mayor
So
I
think
I
wanna
thank
all
of
you
I
know
many
of
you
are
busy
so...
I'll
just
cut
Yesterday,
as
some
of
you
there
was
a
bear
attack
Unfortunately,
and
a
fourth
Taku
He
has
returned.
Ed
Janzer
was
found
who
happened
to
be
Mr.
Mayor.
And
brought
back
Ed
was
shaken
up
pretty
badly,
I've
contacted
They
have
a
couple
who'll
track
the
animal
down
The
problem
is
and
won't
be
able
I
think
you'll
see
we
really
don't
have
much
Not
much
to
worry
about?
I'm
sure
the
Mayor
my
concern
is
for
your
safety
What
are
we
supposed
to
do

For
what
it's
worth,
and
probably
got
between
If
they
go
up
there
then
the
press
We
sure
as
hell
don't
need
Exactly.
That's
why
Our
town
needs
How
the
bear's
handled
is
you
just
keep
doing
We
can't
let
ruin
our
good
town.

When
a
bear
kills
a
human,
Would
you
kill
it?
Me?
No.
You

long
before
this
whole
area
They
didn't
hunt,
And
to
the
Indians,
Why
did
they
call
it

something
would
answer
you.
Something
Hey,
Jenny,
for
the
love
Sorry.
Now,
the
spring
of
1891,
They
didn't
want
and
began
mining.

but
they're
the
peaceful
kind
Everything
was
going
Until--
Until?
Until
something
happened.
By
the
time
the
miners
they
described
this
place
Then
instructed
them
all
And
so
they
did.
When
they
arrived,
they
found
all
the
miners
and
their
families...
dead.
Women,
children,
everything,
everyone
Without
a
second
thought,
the
settlers
took
their
guns,
went
to
the
nearest
tribe
That
was
a
real
massacre.
Not
some
phony
stories



what
did
happen
The
natives
blamed

This
is
not
It's
Taku
He.
What

hell
The
native
peoples

Taku
He,
Sasquatch,
usually
translated
Do

them
All

Wild,
screeching
beasts

for
game
You

No,
I've
seen
and
they
aren't
scary.

any
woman
What?
C'mon!
Who
wants
a
lady


Okay,

I
agree.
Anything

need
And
we
should
listen
Rich,
can
I
talk
with
you
What
the
hell's
going
on?
What's
wrong?

We'll
never
Oh,
no,
but
look.

He
said
we
should
get
Why?
Those
gunshots
There's
a
group
of
hunters
They
might
come
after
us.
Come
on!
What
else
He
said
we
should
head
We
gotta
get
the
message
Whoa!
Message?

Hey,
you!
What
the--
The
bastard
You
and
your
boys
I
will
be
leaving,
alright?
But
after
I
finish
Ed
says
it's
your
fault
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
I
don't
think
You
don't
know
what
What
do
you
think
What
do
you
think
You
should
know
enough
He's
right,
Ed.
You
have
three
seconds
Or
I'll
put
a
bullet
There's
a
creature
out
here
and
you
managed
A
creature.
We
may
be
dumb
For
the
lack
And
whatever
Ed
disturbed
it.
What
did
you
do,
Ed?
Shoot
at
it?
I
should've
shot
you.
Think
what
you
want.
But
right
now,
or
it's
gonna
kill
you
all.
Why
won't
this
thing
It
will.
You
crazy
Indian.

Can
I
see
the
map?
Do
not
tell
me
Just
making
sure
I'm
getting
hungry.
Alright,
dick,
Uhm,
I
think
we
go
Hey,
good.
I'm
not
staying
I'll
get
it.
Are
you
good,
buddy?

We
wait
for
what?
Chief
Eagleheart's
monster.
I
don't
believe
What
do
you
think,
Hell
no,
I
know
damn
well
Like
the
man
said,
my
experience
has
told
me
Boys,
we
got
a
lot
Take
the
knife.
Heat
the
blood
up
Take
it
up
wind.
I'm
sorry,
guys.
We,
uhm,


Good
idea.

It
stinks.
It
smells
Sure
it
does.
Let
me
see.

Okay,
this
is
sick.

What?
Let
me
see,

C'mon,
man!
I
think
it's
moving.

Get
out
of
here!

Jenny!
Shea!


Be
very
quiet,
okay?
You
got
to
get
Sh.

Jenny,
it's
gonna
smell
me.

It's
gonna
smell
me.
That's
the
least

We're
gonna
die
out
here.

Thought
I
told
you

Did
you
hear
that?


You
both
shut
up
Manny,
give
me
What
you're
gonna
do?
I
said
just
to
pass
it.

Save
your
damn
ammo.

I
ain't
dying



Tom!

I
think
I
got
something.
Oh,
my
God.
Tom!
Stupid
fool.
You
did
this!
What
are
you
gonna
do?
I
will,
Ed.
That
disappoints
me,
Manny.
All
my
friends
are
dead
'cause
of
you.
I'm
your
friend,
Manny.
I
am
your
friend.

Okay.
I
don't
know
what
happened.
We
all
got
split
up.
I
don't
know
Mr.
Vancamp,
we
sure
as
hell
I'm
freezing.

What
are
we
gonna
do?
Just
wait,
I
guess.

Did
you
hear
that?
I
can't,


Don't
run.


Base
One

high
camp.
C'mon,
Johnny,
Sheriff's
office.

No,
ma'am,
the
bear

I
sure
will,
ma'am.
I'll
do
that
Yes,
ma'am.

I'll
be
right
there.
Kill
the
bear.
Now,
save
the
bear.


Who
the
hell
are
you?
Jenny
Ackers.
Can
you
please
help
me?
I'm
lost.
Please,
help
me.
I'll
help
you.


Eagleheart!
I'm
gonna
kill


Eagleheart!
I
know
you're
around
here.



Let
her
go.
You
must
think
I'm
the
one
you
want.
See,
that's
the
difference
I'm
willing
to
kill



Thank
God.
What

hell

You,
come
with
me.
Here.
Get

Stop!
Are

Oh!

Yeah,

You'll
