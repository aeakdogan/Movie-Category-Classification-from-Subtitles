Xerxes
passed

Artemisia

men
say
so.
And
based
on
the
last
I'd
say
there's
a
spark
Now
who
is
using
kind
words?
My
men
also
say
that
it
was
you
who
slayed
the
good
king
Many
heroic
deeds
But
it
was
ten
years
ago,
and
the
facts
of
battle
This
deed,
you
would
remember.
I
do
what
I
must
to
defend
Greece.
And
I
do
what
I
must
to
defeat
her.
For
every
one
Greek
killed,
you
must
kill
a
thousand
Persians.
For
every
ship
I
sink...
You
must
sink
a
hundred.
I
can
sustain
losses
for
weeks.
Months,
if
need
be.
My
numbers
will
defeat
you
and
I
will
take
your
precious
I
will
take
your
Greek
freedom.
Are
you
asking
me
to
No.
I
offer
you
a
chance
to
avoid
I'm
in
need
of
a
Look
at
the
defense
you've
mounted.
A
handful
of
triremes.
Leonidas
with
300
Spartans.

It's
insulting,
frankly,
that
the
mightiest
empire
is
met
by
this.
I
don't
blame
you,
Themistokles.
You
fought
as
if
the
blood
was
coursing
through
your
veins.
No,
I
blame
Greece.
The
squabbling
bureaucrats
protecting
their
political
hides
by
sending
you
here
to
die.
And
yet
you
still
fight.
So
there
must
be...
What?
Family
back
home
in
Athens
that
compels
you
to...
Truth
is,
I've
had
I
have
spent
my
entire
adult
life
with
my
one
true
love...
The
Greek
fleet...
And
my
one
passion...
Readying
it
for
you.

Now,
that
brings
me
pleasure,
the
thought
of
you
forsaking
family
and
love...
For
the
promise
of
The
ecstasy
of
steel
and
flesh...
Death
and
life.
Of
rage...
And
sweat
of
muscle.
Of
pure
joy...
And
deepest
sorrow.
Die
with
me
each
night
and
be
born
again
with
As
you

your

from

you
learned?

Can

The

we

She's
