Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For
God
sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey,
what's
wrong?
Every
jackass
thinks
he
knows
Especially
those
We
like
things
nice
and
simple,
good
and
evil,
heroes
and
villains.
There's
always
plenty
of
both.
Most
of
the
time,
Where
is
he?
Where
is
he?
Where...
Where
is
he?
Where
is
he?
Mr.
Bradley?
Mr.
B?
You
okay?
-Where
is
he?
Where
is
he?
Where
did
he
go?
All
right.
Just
stay
right
here,
okay?
I'm
gonna
call
an
ambulance.
Where
is
he?
Most
guys
I
knew
would
never
talk
Probably
'cause
they're
They
certainly
didn't
They
died
without
glory.
Nobody
has
taken
their
pictures.
Only
their
buddies
knew
what
they
did.
I'd
tell
their
folks
I'm
not
sure
that
was
it.
Now,
there
were
plenty
other
photos
but
none
anybody
wanted
to
see.
What
we
see
and
do
in
war,
the
cruelty,
is
unbelievable.
But
somehow
To
do
that,
and
damn
few
words.
Film's
ruined.
I
don't
know.
This
one
looks
all
right.
And
if
you
can
get
a
picture...
Now,
the
right
picture
You're
gonna
want
to
see
this.
Look
at
Vietnam.
The
picture
of
that
blowing
that
fella's
brains
That
was
it.
The
war
was
lost.
We
just
hung
around
Took
a
lot
of
other
pictures
that
day.
Thanks.
Appreciate
it.
Sounds
ridiculous,
but
it
happened.
Country
was
bankrupt.
People
were
becoming
Oh,
my
Lord,
that's
Harlon!
Where?
Right
there.
Ma,
all
you
can
see
is
his
behind.
And
that's
his.
I
powdered
That's
him.
Go
get
your
father.
Daddy,
Ma's
got
a
picture
You
watch
your
mouth,
young
man.
Thank
you.
One
photo,
almost
all
on
its
own,
It's
on
the
front
page
Over
200
dailies
and
they're
I
think
we
might
have
found
it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-I
gotta
go
get
him.
Iggy,
I
gotta
go.
I
have
a
whole
different
theory.
He
wants
medical
attention
bad
enough,
Shut
up
and
crawl
over
here,
As
soon
as
that
flare
goes
out.
-Crap.
Okay,
well,
I'll
go
with
you.
You're
actually
gonna
leave
me
here?
I'll
be
right
back,
Oh,
God.
Okay,
it's
okay.
Don't
touch
them.
Don't
touch
them.
Get
your
hands
out
of
there.
Don't
look.
Keep
your
head
back.
All
right,
look
at
me.
We'll
get
this
bandage
on
you.
And
we'll
get
you
down
to
the
bottom,
Look,
you're
gonna
be
fine.
It's
okay.
I'll
do
that.
I'll
do
that.
Here,
put
some
pressure
on
that.
Put
your
hands
on
top
Keep
your
head
back.
Keep
breathing.
Keep
looking
at
me,
all
right?
Doc.
Help
me.
Help
me.
All
right.
Okay.
How's
that
feel?
-It
feels
good.
-Good.
I'm
gonna
go
get
a
stretcher
and
get
I'm
all
right.
Go
and
help
someone
who's
hurt.
All
right.
Hold
on
there.
-Where'd
he
go?
The
guy
who
was
right
here,
Ignatowski.
-I
think
you
jumped
in
the
wrong
hole.
He
was
right
here,
lggy!
lggy!
You
shut
up.
You
want
every
Jap
lggy!
Holy
shit.
They
expect
us
to
climb
this?
Or
something
just
like
it.
So,
where
you
think
they're
sending
us?
I
think
it's
the
desert,
Franklin.
Well,
that
makes
no
sense
at
all.
Well,
it's
just
military
psychology.
They
always
train
you
for
the
desert
Now
you're
just
having
fun
with
me.
Harlon,
take
your
men
right.
-Watch
for
Bedouins.
-What's
a
Bedouin?
Well,
Jeez
Louise,
Now,
you
tilt
that
to
the
right,
but
Bullets
don't
come
from
the
left.
That
makes
about
as
much
sense
You
don't
even
know
why
you
do
it,
'Cause
I
don't
tell
you
You
do
it
'cause
Mike
does
it.
I'll
ask
him.
So
you
cut
hair
back
home?
Some.
Training
to
be
a
barber,
are
you,
Doc?
No,
I
just
studied
it
a
little.
But
not
in
barber
school?
Nope.
-Gosh.
Chief,
I
had
very
little
to
do
so
maybe
you
could
stop
Different
tribe.
The
Pimas
fought
-See,
now
that's
smart.
Yeah.
Worked
real
good
for
us.
Good
luck,
fellas.
Hey,
good
night,
Lindberg.
Dead
bodies.
What?
Even
I
knew
that.
-Who's
in?
It
must
be
a
lot
easier
with
them
-There's
that.
You
know
what
I
been
thinking?
Well,
they
been
telling
us
and
I
think
we'd
make
And
how
do
you
figure
that?
Well,
you
know,
So,
why
do
you
cut
dead
people's
hair,
I'm
studying
to
work
in
a
funeral
home.
You
tell
a
lot
of
people
that?
You
actually
chose
the
Marines
No
sense
being
a
hero
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do
anything
on
that
reservation
All
right,
listen
up,
We
practice
going
which
means
we
ain't
long
All
right!
One
more
thing,
any
man
who
doesn't
better
get
them
signed
by
tomorrow
-I
got
mine
already.
Wait.
Why
am
I
just
hearing
about
this?
That's
horseshit,
Franklin.
I
don't
have
No,
I
didn't
hear
nothing
Heard
they
were
running
short.
You
know,
nobody
tells
me
nothing.
All
right,
get
your
ass
over
Maybe
he
got
some
more
left.
-Leave
your
smokes.
I'll
play
for
you.
Listen,
he
calls
you
an
idiot,
Just
do
not
leave
without
signing
them.
-I
appreciate
it,
Sergeant.
What
the
hell
happened
to
your
hair,
Look
like
a
goddamn
corpse.
Three
points
of
contact
on
that
rope
Next
four.
Over
the
side.
Let's
go.
Keep
moving.
Next
four,
over
the
side.
Just
keep
your
eye
That's
all
you
gotta
look
at.
Watch
me,
Doc,
just
watch
me.
Keep
three
points
of
contact
You
see?
No
big
thing.
Just
one
step
at
a
time
and
keep
Remember,
once
you're
in
the
boat
Just
make
sure
you
keep
three
points
I
got
him!
All
right,
get
that
man
out
of
the
water.
Give
me
a
hand.
Grab
his
pack.
Don't
worry
about
him,
Doc.
All
right,
quit
skylarking!
Keep
it
moving!
He'll
be
fine.
Our
target,
Island
X,
is
an
ugly,
smelly,
It
means
"Sulfur
Island,"
Looks
sort
of
like
a
burnt
pork
chop,
After
20
straight
days
of
bombing
you
won't
find
a
blade
of
grass
It
wasn't
that
pretty
to
start
with.
Captain?
lwo's
just
five-and-a-half
miles
long,
There's
a
lump
down
at
the
bottom.
On
the
maps
in
front
of
you
Not
much
of
it.
The
black
dots
represent
Coastal
defense
guns,
covered
artillery
emplacements.
Rifle
pits,
foxholes,
antitank
guns
machine
guns,
blockhouses,
pillboxes,
I
don't
see
any
barracks
That's
right.
And
we
still
don't
know
why.
Now,
this
isn't
just
any
island
to
them.
This
isn't
Tarawa,
Guam,
Tinian,
This
is
Japanese
soil,
sacred
ground.
Twelve
thousand
Japanese
defenders
They
will
not
leave
politely,
gentlemen.
It's
up
to
us
to
convince
them.
The
28th
will
land
here
at
Green
Beach.
The
8th
Ammo
Company
The
Suribachi's
guns
They
can
hit
any
point
on
the
island.
We're
sitting
ducks
That's
our
job.
We
cut
across
the
island,
right
at
the
And
we
take
that
mountain.
We
take
that
mountain,
We
take
their
eyes.
Okay,
I'm
heading
in.
Follow
me.
Let's
put
a
good
show
on
Close
it
up.
Yeah,
boys!
Man
overboard
portside!
See
him?
Throw
me
a
line!
He's
right
there.
-Where
is
he?
Hawaii's
that
way!
Just
keep
paddling,
Mac,
Hold
on,
they're
gonna
lower
a
raft!
They're
not
gonna
stop.
What?
None
of
them
are.
They
can't.
So
much
for
"No
man
left
behind."
-Sir.
Look,
I've
had
to
make
I'm
promoting
you
to
platoon
sergeant.
-Thank
you,
sir.
I
appreciate
it.
Trouble
is,
I
already
told
my
men
That
your
'Cause
I've
heard
better.
Well,
I'll
keep
practicing,
then.
Look,
this
isn't
-You
don't
need
to
prove
anything.
You're
not
the
best
sergeant
you're
just
the
best
one
-Block's
a
good
man.
The
men
know
him,
he
can
step
right
in.
You
know,
Platoon
sergeant
puts
you
further
away
I
already
gave
them
my
word,
sir.
I
told
them
I'd
bring
them
all
home
which
means
I
already
lied
to
half
-How
are
your
men?
Except
maybe
Gagnon.
Our
own
Tyrone
Power?
Yes,
sir.
He's
a
good
man,
just
might
be
I'll
use
him
as
a
runner.
All
right.
Thank
you,
sir.
Now
get
out
of
here.
Hear
the
good
news,
Doc?
Hey,
you
do
that
again
Fucking
dominoes.
Iggy,
have
you
ever
heard
news
The
first
ones
off
the
ship,
Doc.
Means
we
don't
go
over
We
hop
on
a
tractor,
Oh,
shit,
that
is
good
news.
You
see?
What'd
I
tell
you?
What's
going
on?
Look
at
that.
We're
killing
them!
We're
killing
them,
Doc.
I
was
promised
10
days
of
shelling.
You're
giving
me
three
I
don't
give
a
shit!
My
men
hit
and
I'll
be
taking
them
home
Yeah,
I
know
exactly
why.
Because
every
Navy
man
with
wants
to
offload
us
here
so
they
can
be
there
for
the
big
finish,
tell
their
kids
they
captured
Well,
you
aren't
going
to
Japan
These
little
pricks
are
dug
in!
Okay,
appreciate
that,
Jim.
Sharpen
your
knife
or
bayonet?
I'm
okay.
Sharpen
your
knife
or
bayonet?
Jesus,
lggy,
just
leave
me
alone,
How
about
you
guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
How
about
you,
Doc?
You
sharpened
it
three
times
already.
Well,
then
I
better
make
sure
Good
man,
Doc.
-Hey,
Doc.
When
we
land,
try
not
to
wave
They
got
sharpshooters
And
they
know
that
another
dozen
Marines
Okay,
Mike.
Yeah,
right
there.
Close
the
damn
door.
For
God's
sake.
Yeah,
like
that's
gonna
help.
That
your
girlfriend,
Chief?
Bet
she's
a
pretty
Bet
you're
missing
her,
Welcome,
all
Marines
off
lwo
Jima.
We
have
a
long-time
wait...
It's
what
they
do
to
prisoners,
-at
least
the
lucky
ones.
If
I
were
you,
cowpokes,
I
wouldn't
think
Poor
Marines,
so
far
from
home
Think
of
your
girls
back
home,
But
a
girl
cannot
stay
home
every
night.
So
who
do
you
think
And
will
she
let
him
kiss
her?
This
sweet
music
is
to
make
you
think
who
are
missing
you.
This
is
all
for
now.
Gunners!
Move,
let's
go!
Gunners!
We're
clear!
Get
up
the
berm!
Baker
Company,

-Seen
Second
Platoon?
First

Go,

Go,

Go!
Go,

All
clear!
-Jesus,
you
needed
some
exercise?
A
hundred
landing
craft
heading
Now
I'm
glad
we
did.
Any
theories
why
they
ain't
shooting?
It's
getting
on
my
nerves.
Maybe
they're
all
dead.
What
do
you
think,
Doc?
Mike,
take
six
men
Second
Platoon,
let's
move
out!
Move!
Move!
-Get
down!
Move
out!
Cover
fire!
Pour
it
on!
Ray,
shift
your
fire
to
the
right,
now!
Corpsman!
I'm
gonna
sling
your
arm
Move,
move!
Off
the
beach!
Take
cover!
You
got
a
girl
back
home,
Marine?
We're
gonna
make
sure
I
need
pressure
on
this
wound!
Where's
the
fire
coming
from?
Where
are
they?
Look
for
a
flash,
shoot
at
it!
Let's
go,
let...
Twelve
o'clock,
take
out
the
bunker!
You're
over!
Third
Squad,
forward!
Move!
Where
are
they,
sir?
We
got
ten
o'clock!
-Sergeant!
I
think
I
can
clear
that
out.
All
right,
you
go.
Here.
Take
these.
Check
your
weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover
him!
Cover,

Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's
go!
Go!
Move
it
out!
Go,
go,
go!
Down,
down,
down!
It's
clear.
Good
work.
I
thought
you
said
it
was
clear!
It
was!
Shit,
I
guess
they're
not
in
there
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light
it
up!
I'll
cover
you,
Ice!
Don't
cover
shit!
There's
already
One
bullet
and
this
thing
goes
up
Go!
Shift
fire!
Shift
your
fire!
Go,
go!
Shift
your
fire!
Shift
your
fire!
Go!
Move
it
out!
Hit

deck!
Is
this
a
bad
battle
or
what?
It's
a
fucking
slaughter.
Christ

machine
gun
team
Thank
God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get

tanks

Oh,

Get

Corporal,

flank!
Let's

lift
your
side,
Got

Doc!
Incoming!
Move,

Keep
moving!
Get
that
LVT
up
on
the
beach!
Keep
moving!
You're
next,
pal,
Move
it!
Great
news.
Maybe
if
you
live
up
on
Camp
Tarawa,
Not
you
and
me.
Captain
Severance
asked
me
and
Christ
if
I
could
remember,
but
it
was
Mike
and
Doc
and
Franklin
but
I
just
remembered,
I
wasn't
there.
'Course
you
were.
Neither
was
Hank.
It
was
Harlon
Block
that
raised
that
one.
Shit.
I
told
them
it
was
Hank.
You
weren't
there,
Mr.
Smart
Ass,
-You
tell
them
it
was
me?
Good,
keep
your
mouth
shut.
They
know
there
was
somebody
else,
Then
pick
someone
dead.
They
don't
want
somebody
dead,
they
want
to
ship
us
back
to
the
States.
What
did
I
tell
you?
I
wasn't
there.
-You
hear?
Just
settle
down.
-I'm
not
going
anywhere.
Who
the
hell
says?
This
is
horseshit.
You
wounded,
son?
No,
sir.
Well,
did
you
take
out
a
nest
of
Japs
'Cause
if
I'm
gonna
give
up
my
seat
he
better
have
No,
sir.
Then
enjoy
it,
'cause
they'll
forget
you
The
sixth
man,
you
got
a
name?
Sorry,
still
don't
remember.
It's
a
damn
shame,
'cause
I
promised
Fact,
you
not
knowing
being
one
of
the
flag-raisers
yourself.
Since
no
one
wants
to
be
embarrassed,
they'll
turn
you
around,
in
time
to
meet
your
buddies
So,
why
don't
you
stop
screwing
Gangway!
Gangway!
Where
the
hell
is
that
son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes,
get
your
red
ass
over
here!
Make
me
look
like
I
don't
know
with
a
flag
the
size
God
damn
it,
Ira,
You
made
me
look
like
We're
gonna
miss
you
around
here.
Now
your
name's
in
the
paper,
too.
Just
heard
your
doctor
say
You're
being
shipped
back
Everybody
who
saw
that
picture
That's
all
they
wanted
to
know.
Victory.
Within
a
few
weeks
of
that
picture
being
Mrs.
Hansen!
Mrs.
Hansen!
-Are
you
proud
of
him,
Mrs.
Hansen?
Look
this
way,
please,
ma'am.
What
do
you
have
to
say
But
somehow
being
a
part
of
it
Looking
at
it,
you
could
believe
Yeah,
I
might
have
thought
It
is.
Belle,
their
names
are
right
here.
And
he
would
be
alive
You
think
about
that
And
I
need
to
rush
home
and
change
because
there's
the
Governor's
banquet
Imagine,
the
Governor
is
coming
here
Now,
I'm
wearing
blue
so,
if...
-Are
you
going
to
change?
a
special
news
bulletin
A
press
association
has
just
announced
The
President
died
All

for
Christ's
sake.
My
God,

I've

Who
are
these
"Gold
Star
Mothers"?
That's
what
we're
calling
the
mothers
You
present
each
mother
with
a
flag,
they
say
a
few
words,
It'll
be
so
moving.
But
this
says
Hank
Hansen's
mom.
Lovely
woman.
She
knows
how
close
He
wrote
home
about
you.
She
is
very,
very
much
Hank
wasn't
in
the
picture.
Sorry?
Hank
didn't
raise
that
flag.
He
raised
the
other
one,
the
real
flag.
The
what?
The
real...
Yeah,
ours
was
the
replacement
flag.
We
put
it
up
when
they
took
Am
I
the
only
one
getting
a
headache
It
was
after
it
was
already
in
the
papers.
The
mothers
had
already
That's
it,
that's
beautiful.
Yeah,
why
tell
me?
I'm
only
the
guy
that
has
to
explain
it
Who
is
in
the
goddamn
picture?
Are
any
of
you
guys
Yeah,
we're
in
the
goddamn
picture.
Six
guys
raising
a
flag
over
lwo
Jima.
You're
three
of
them,
right?
This
was
the
fifth
day,
sir.
Well,
what'd
you
do,
raise
a
goddamn
Can
I
hit
this
guy?
You
know
what,
I
don't
give
a

calling
They
might've
called
it
the
"We're
Flat
Fucking
Broke
"So
We're
Begging
For
Your
Pennies"
but
it
didn't
have
quite
the
ring.
because
the
last
four
bond
drives
we
just
printed
money
instead.
Ask
any
smart
boy
on
Wall
Street,
our
dollar
is
next
to
worthless,
And
nobody
is
lending
any
more.
Tanks
aren't
being
built.
Machine
guns,
You
think
this
is
a
farce?
Well,
stuff
some
rocks
in
your
pockets
because
that's
all
we
got
left
And
don't
be
surprised
if

because
the
fuel
dumps
are
empty.
And
our
good
friends,
the
Arabs,
If
we
don't
raise
$14
billion,
and
that's
million
with
a
"B,"
We
make
a
deal
with
the
Japanese,
and
we
come
home,
and
they
sure
as
shit
ain't
giving
up.
$14
billion.
The
last
three
drives
People
on
the
street
corners,
they
looked
at
this
picture
Don't
ask
me
why,
You
can't
even
see
your
faces.
But
it
said
we
can
win
this
war,
we
just
need
you
to
dig
a
little
deeper.
They
want
to
give
us
that
money.
No,
they
want
to
give
it
to
you.
But
you,
you
don't
want
to
ask
for
it.
You
want
to
explain
about
Well,
that's
your
choice.
Because
if
we
admit
we
made
a

that
will
be
that.
Gentlemen.
Mr.
President,
here
they
are.
-Well,
hello.
Good
to
see
you.
Darn
good
to
see
you,
boys.
Heard
you
had
a
hell
of
a
fight
Yes,
sir.
Ira,
you're
off
the
Gila
River
Reservation
Yes,
Mr.
President.
Being
an
Indian,
Bet
your
people
are
proud
to
see
you
Very
proud,
sir.
They
should
be.
Well,
I
want
to
thank
you
for
coming
all
You
fought
for
a
mountain
in
the
Pacific
now
we
need
you
to
fight
-And
I
don't
expect
you'll
let
us
down.
Good.
Go
get
it.
That's
the
end
of
this
ceremony.
Let's
take
a
look
at
this
famous
photo
My
gosh.
There
you
are.
Boys.
Boys,
this
one's
on
me.
Yes,
sir.
Excuse
me,
Mr.
Gagnon.
I
suppose.
And
your
name
is?
I
don't
know
about
you,
I'm
drinking
with
the
wrong
heroes.
You're
such
a
hero.
That's
just
not
true.
That's
professional
work.
Here
they
are.
You're
the
guys
I
heard
you
were
on
the
train.
Let
me
shake
your
hands,
John
Bradley.
These
boys
are
with
me,
Harvard
Pappies
all
rich
sons-of-bitches.
Boys,
shake
hands
Excuse
me
for
one
moment.
You
can
buy
them
a
drink
That's
right.
Drinks
for
these
men
And
you're
the
other
one,
aren't
you?
-Rene
Gagnon.
Have
a
drink,
come
on.
Listen
to
me,
Rene,
when
you
get
finished
because
if
you
can
sell
bonds,
Now,
they're
not
gonna
build
homes
-You
heard
of
prefab
homes?
Well,
you
will.
And
you
hang
on
to
that
-All
right?
All
right.
This
sure
takes
it,
huh,
Doc?
If
Mike
and
the
guys
could
see
us.
Yeah,
they'd
hardly
believe
it,
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can
you
imagine
Franklin
on
this
train
eating
at
the
dining
car
We
shouldn't
be
here,
Doc.
There's
gonna
be
a
Hallelujah
Day
When
the
boys
And
a
million
bands
begin
to
play
We'll
be
dancing
the
Victory
Polka
And
when
we've
lit
the
torch
of
liberty
In
each
blacked-out
land
across
the
sea
Ira!
Hey,
Ira!
What?
We
heard
you
posed
the
picture!
Hey,
Doc!
We're
bigger
than
life,
Doc!
And
we'll
heave
a
mighty
sigh
When
each
gal
can
kiss
the
boy
And
they'll
come
marching
down
The
United
Nations
in
review
When
this
lovely
dream
We'll
be
dancing
the
Victory
Polka
Good
job.
Thank
you.
Thank
you,
girls!
And
now,
here
are
the
men
the
men
in
white.
Right
behind
me
here,
Private
First
Class
Rene
Gagnon,
Private
First
Class
Ira
Hayes,
and
Navy
Corpsman
Thank
you.
It's
good
of
you
people
to
come
out
We
really
need
you
to
buy
bonds,
'Cause
we
can't
win
the
war
As
far
as
us
being
the
heroes
that's
just
not
the
case.
We
really
didn't
do
much
at
all.
Especially
him.
Especially
me.
I
was
just
a
runner.
That's
it.
We
put
up
a
flag.
The
pole
we
attached
it
to
was
heavy,
We
had
our
picture
taken
doing
it.
The
real
heroes
are
dead
on
that
island.
And
we'd
appreciate
it
if
you
bought
Jump
on
any
grenades,
Ira?
Take
out
any
machine
gun
nests
At
least
I
fired
my
weapon.
All
right,
knock
it
off.
You
hit
anything
What?
Guys!
Come
on!
Stop
it.
Knock
it
off.
The
tall
man
with
the
high
hat
Get
your
savings
out
"Any
bonds
today?"
Any
bonds
today?
Bonds
of
freedom
that's
what
I'm
selling
Any
bonds
today?
Rene,
right
here.
Here
comes
the
freedom
man
Asking
you
to
buy
...for
us
and
they
need
our
help.
And,
if
you
think
about
it,
that
buying
more
bonds
but
the
only
thing
to
do.
Yes,
this
war
has
gone
on
too
long.
We
have
given
too
many
lives.
-Chocolate
or
strawberry,
sir?
...has
been
far
too
high.
But
if
we
waver
now,
if
we
don't
dig
deep
and
give
more
then
those
sacrifices
would
be
wasted...
Chocolate
or
strawberry,
sir?
...and
those
lives
lost
in
vain.
Let's
move!
Go,
go!
Easy
Six,
this
is
Easy
Two,
over.
Stuck
in
the
sand.
Christ.
That's
real
good
work
All
right,
prepare
to
move
out.
Second
Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All
right,
Second

your
feet!

out!

of
there!
