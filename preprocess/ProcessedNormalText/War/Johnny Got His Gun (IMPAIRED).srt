When

would
be
cruel
to
pretend
that
anyone
What
you
need
is
a

No,
not

I'm
asking
is
for
you
that's
in
my
mind
Maybe
only
2
or
3
It's--
It's
such
but
they
won't
listen.
They
won't
hear
me.
All
they
do
is
give
me
dope,
and
I
go
down
and
down
and...
Oh,
there
you
are,
brothers.
What
were
you
hunting
Look,
Father!

I
am,
Father.
I
am.
Hear
me.
Please
try
to
understand

She
did
hear
me!
She's
going

She
didn't
even
I've
broken
through.
I'm
back
Hello,
It's
me,
and
we're
going
They're
here.
A
lot
of
them.
It's
Morse
code.
For
what?
SOS.
Help.
Do
you
mean
to
say
is
actually
speaking
to
us?
What
are
they
doing?
Yes,
sir.
Decerebrated,
General?
Completely
decerebrated?
What
are
they
waiting
for?
What's
happening?
Are
they
leaving?
No.
Just
one
of
them.
Or
maybe
two.
No.
Just
one.
Ask
what
he
wants.
How
can
I
ask
a
man
like
this
By
asking
it.
Why
don't
they
do
something?
They
are.
do...you...
want?
What
do
I
want?
What
do
I
want?
What
I
want...
I
want
out!
I
want
to
feel
fresh
air
I
want
to
feel
people
No.
It
would
cost
too
much
money
taking
care
of
me
They
never
do
that.
But--
But
maybe
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
Yes!
There
is
a
way!
All
you
have
to
do
and
people
Lots
of
people.
with
windows
in
it,
are
spending
money
Take
me
to
the
beaches
and
the
4th
of
July
and
all
the
church
bazaars.
They've
seen
or
the
dog-faced
man
who
crawls
on
his
belly
But
they're
not
real
freaks.
They
were
made
But
this
thing
here
was
made
by
people--
by
you
and
me
and
that
takes
and
costs
a
lot
of
money.
Advertise
me
as
the
only
that
can
talk
through
And
if
that
then
bill
me
as
the
last
man
Because
the
army
makes
men.
So
rally
around
your
flag,
their
flag,
because
the
flag
and
the
army
makes
men.
I...want...out...
so...people...
can...see...
what...I
am.
Put
me...in...
a...
c-carnival...show
where
they...can
look...at
me.
Let...me
out.
Well,
what
could
we
Tell
him,
uh...
Tell
him
we'll
do
but,
uh,
his
condition
For
the
present,
that
is.
Be
sure
to
say
If...
you...
won't...let...
people
see
me,
then...
kill
me.
He's
upset.
Ask
him
what
his
name
is.
These
shutters
are
to
be
closed
What's
he
saying?
He
says,
"Kill
me."
Over
and
over
again.

For
now,
he
needs
rest.
Tell
him
we'll
give
him
And
try
to
get
his
name.
You're
not
to
mention
I'll
hold
you
collectively
If
new
orders
are
received
you'll
be
notified.
Well?
He
won't
wait
All
he
says
is
"Kill
me,
kill
me,
kill
me."
Don't
you
have
some
message
You
could
at
least
tell
him
to
put
his
faith
in
God,
I'll
pray
for
him
but
I
will
not
risk
against
your
stupidity.
Well,
you're
a
hell
He's
the
product
not
mine.

Give
him
a
light
sedative,

Why
don't
they
get
it
But
you're
still
here.
Can't
you
see
I'm
asking
you
to
kill
me.
Please
do.

O
my
God,
I'm
heartily
sorry
for
having
offended
thee.
And
I
detest
all
my
sins,
not
because
of
Thy
judgment,
but
because
and
deserving
I
firmly
resolve,
with
the
help
of
thy
grace,
to
sin
no
more,
to
avoid
Amen.
Oh,
nurse--
beautiful,
thank
you,
thank
you,
thank
you.
Dear
God,
Be
sweet
to
her,
God.
Make
her
happy.
Make
everything
she
wants
Make
everyone
love
her!
No!
No.
Leave
the
room.
Oh,
somebody
stopped
her.
Why?
I
said,
Give
me
the
key.
What's
happening?
The
key?
Go
on.
She's
going.
I
can
feel
her
He's
sending
her
away.
Why?
First
they
and
now
they're
Why
did
they
Why
is
he
Why
won't
they
Because
I'm
a
secret
Oh,
I
don't
know.
She's
gone.
Good-bye,
nurse.
You're
gone,
and
I'm
a
secret.
Oh,
no.
Not
that
again.
I--
I
thought
that
I
found
a
way
to--
to
talk
to
them.
But
they're
not.
The
only
thing
on
this
earth
they
won't
let
me
do.
All
they
want
is
to
push
me
back
into
the
darkness
so
they
won't
ever

He's
gone,
too.
Well,
now
I
know.
They'll
never
let
me
out.
They'll
keep
me
a
secret
here
when
I'm
an
old,
old
man,
I'll
sneak
away
It
isn't
easy,
though.
Inside
me,
and
howling
and
nobody
If
I
had
arms,
If
I
had
legs,
If
I
had
a
voice,
I
could
talk
and
be
some
I
could
yell
for
help.
But
nobody'd
help
me.
Not
even
God,
Couldn't
be
And,
uh...
And
yet,
I've
just
got
because
I--
I
don't
see
how
I
can
go
on
like
this
much
longer.
SOS.
Help
me.
SOS.
Help
me.
SOS.
Help
me.
SOS.
Help
me.
SOS.
Help
me.
SOS.

SOS.
Help
me.
SOS.
Help
me.
