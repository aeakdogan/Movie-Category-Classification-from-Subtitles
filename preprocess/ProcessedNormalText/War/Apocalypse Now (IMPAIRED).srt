stay
out
of
the
way
and
bring
your
heinie
home
because
we
love
you
Love,
Mom.
Can't
see
nothing.
You're
not
authorized
I
can't
see
a
thing,
I'm
stopping
this
boat.
I
ain't
risking
I'm
in
command
here,
You'lI
do
what
I
say.
You
see
anything,
Chef?
Why
don't
they
Watch
it
over
here,
Chief!
Let's
do
it.
Lance,
on
the
50.
He
was
close.
He
was
real
close.
I
couldn't
see
him
yet,
as
if
the
boat
and
the
water
was
flowing
Whatever
was
going
it
wouldn't
be
back
in
Nha
Trang.
Arrows!
Chef!
Chef,
open
up
fire!
Lance,
fire!
Chef!
Chef,
it's
OK!
They're
just
little
toy
arrows!
Cut
it
out!
Quiet!
Chief,
tell
them
They're
just
trying
Quiet!
You
can't
get
us
Because
you
don't
know
Do
you?
You
son
of
a
bitch!
A
spear.
My
mission
was
There's
a
Green
Beret
who's
gone
insane.
I
was
supposed
That's
fucking
typical.
Shit!
I'm
short,
so
you
can
kill
That's
fucking
great!
Shit!
That's
fucking
crazy!
I
thought
to
blow
up
a
bridge
or
some
fucking
railroad
Sorry.
No.
No,
wait.
We'll
go
together
We'll
go
with
you.
We'll
go
up
there,
OK?
Part
of
me
was
afraid
and
what
I
would
do
I
knew
the
risks...
or
imagined
I
knew.
But
the
thing
much
stronger
than
fear,
was
the
desire
Just
keep
moving.
Lance,
keep
your
hands
It's
all
right!
It's
all
right!
It's
all
been
approved!
I
ain't
coming
in
there!
Them
bastards
attacked
us!
Come
on!
Zap
them
There's
mines
over
there
And
watch
out.
Wow.
That's
a
pretty
one.
Move
it
right
in
I'm
an
American.
Yeah!
American
civilian.
Hi.
American.
American
civilian.
You
got
the
cigarettes.
That's
what
I've
Chef...
Who
are
you?
Who
are
you?
I'm
a
photojournalist.
I've
covered
the
war
I've
been
in
Laos,
A-phew-whee!
Phew-whee,
baby!
I'll
tell
you
one
thing.
This
boat
is
a
mess,
man.
Who
are
all
these
people?
They
think
you've
come
to...
to
take
him
away.
I
hope
Take
who
away?
Him!
Colonel
Kurtz.
These
are
all
As
far
as
you
can
see.
Hell,
man,
out
here,
Could
we,
uh,
Hey,
man,
you
don't
talk
You
listen
to
him.
Uh...the
man's
He's
a
poet-warrior
I
mean,
sometimes,
He'll
just
He
won't
Then
suddenly
throw
you
in
a
corner,
"do
you
know
that
if
lf
you
can
trust
yourself
I
can't--
He's
a
great
man.
I
should
have
been
scuttling
across
floors
Stay
with
the
boat.
Don't
go
I
want
to
He
can
be
terrible,
and
he
can
be
mean,
and
he
can
be
right.
He's
fighting
the
war.
He's
a
great
man.
I
mean...
I
wish
I
had
words.
I
wish
I
had
words.
I
could
tell
you
something
like
the
other
day,
Why
did
he
Because
I
took
his
picture.
He
said,
"if
you
take
I'm
going
to
kill
you."
And
he
meant
it.
So
you
just
lay
cool,
Lay
back,
dig
it?
He
gets
friendly
again.
But
you
don't--
You
don't
judge
You
don't
judge
the
colonel
like
OK,
watch
it
now.
These
are
Americans!
Feel
the
vibe
Let
me
Hey,
could
you--
Could
you
hold
it
Colby.
The
heads.
You're
looking
Hey,
sometimes
He's
the
first
one
He's
gone
crazy.
Wrong!
Wrong!
lf
you
could
have
just
two
days
ago...
lf
you
could
have
You're
going
to
call
him
crazy?
Fuckin'
A.
I
just
want
Well,
man,
Disappeared
with
his
people.
I'll
wait
for
him.
He
feels
comfortable
He
forgets
himself
He
forgets
himself.
Captain.
Maybe
we
should
wait
OK,
Chef.
We'll
go
back
Yeah.
This
colonel
guy,
He's
worse
than
crazy--
He's
evil.
That's
what
the
man's
Man,
it's
fucking
Look
around
you.
Shit,
he's
loco.
Then
you'll
help
me?
Help
you?
fuckin'
A,
I'lI
do
anything
to
We
could
blow
They're
so
fucking
they
wouldn't
I
ain't
afraid
of
and
altars
and
shit.
I
used
to
think
if
then
my
soul
to
make
it
to
heaven.
But
now...
Fuck.
I
mean,
I
don't
care
as
long
as
So
what
do
you
I'll
kill
the
fuck.
Get
out
of
here.
I'm
going
to
need
you
I'll
go
up
with
Lance,
check
the
place
out,
see
if
I
can
find
What
do

Damn

Here.
and
if

Everything
I
saw
told
me
The
place
North
Vietnamese,
lf
I
was
still
alive,
it
was
because
Hey!
It
smelled
like
Malaria...
Nightmares.
This
was
the
end
Where
are
you
from,
I'm
from
Ohio,
sir.
Were
you
born
there?
Yes.
Whereabouts?
Toledo,
sir.
How
far
are
you
The
Ohio
River,
Uh-huh.
About
200
miles.
I
went
down
that
river
once
There's
a
place
I
can't
remember.
Must
have
been
or
a
flower
plantation
It's
all
wild
but
for
about
5
miles,
you'd
think
that
heaven
in
the
form
Have
you
ever
considered...
any
real
freedoms?
Freedoms
from
the
opinion
even
the
opinions
Did
they
say
why...
why
they
want
I
was
sent
on
a
It's
no
longer
classified,
is
it?
What
did
they
tell
you?
They
told
me...
that
you
had
gone...
totally
insane.
And,
uh...
that
your...
unsound.
Are
my
methods
unsound?
I
don't
see...
any
method...
I
expected...
What
did
you
expect?
Are
you
an
assassin?
I'm
a
soldier.
You're
neither.
You're
an
errand
boy...
sent
by
grocery
clerks...
to
collect
a
bill.
Why,
huh?
Why
would
want
to
kill
a
genius?
Going
in
Why?
You
know...
do
you
know
the
man
He
likes
you.
But...
he's
got
something
Aren't
you
I'm
curious.
I'm
very
curious.
Are
you
curious?
There's
something
You
know
something,
man?
I
know
something
That's
right,
jack.
The
man
is
clear
but
his
soul
is
mad.
Oh,
yeah.
He's
dying,
I
think.
He
hates
all
this.
But
the
man's,
uh...
He
reads
poetry
And
a
voice...
A
voice...
He
likes
you
'cause
He's
got
plans
for
you.
I'm
not
going
to
help
you.
You're
going
to
help
him.
What
are
they
going
to
say
'Cause
he
dies
when
it
dies--
When
it
dies,
he
dies.
What
are
they
going
That
he
was
a
kind
man,
He
had
plans,
Bullshit,
man!
Am
I
going
to
be
the
one
Look
at
me--
You.
Almost
eight
hours.
God.
I'm
asleep.
I'm
asleep
and
dreaming
Fuck.
Has
it
been
Hello,
Almighty,
This
is
PBR
Street
Gang.
Radio
check,
over.
PBR
Street
Gang,
this
is
Almighty
Ooh!
Ooh!
Oh,
Jesus!
Oh,
Christ!
Oh!
"We
are
the
hollow
men,
"We
are
the
stuffed
men,
"Leaning
together
"Alas!
Our
dried
voices
"Are
quiet
As
wind
in
dry
grass..."
Oh,
he's
out
there.
He's
really
out
there.
"Shape
without
form..."
"Shade
without
color.
"Paralyzed
force...
Gesture
without
motion."
Do
you
know
Do
you?
This
is
dialectics.
It's
very
simple
dialectics--
One
through
nine.
No
maybes,
no
supposes,
You
can't
You
can't
go
out
into
What
are
you
going
What
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
go
That's
dialectic
physics.
Dialectic
logic
is
You
either
love
somebody
This
is
the
way
Look
at
this
fucking
Not
with
a
bang...
And
with
a
whimper,
On
the
river,
I
thought
that
the
minute
I'd
know
what
to
do.
But
it
didn't
happen.
I
was
in
there
not
under
guard.
I
was
free.
But
he
knew
He
knew
more
about
than
I
did.
lf
the
generals
could
see
what
I
saw,
would
they
stilI
want
me
More
than
ever,
probably.
What
would
his
people
if
they
learned
how
far
He
broke
from
them,
and
then
he
broke
I'd
never
seen
a
man
I've
seen
horrors,
horrors
that
you've
seen.
But
you
have
no
right
You
have
a
right
You
have
a
right
But
you
have
no
right
It's
impossible
to
describe...
what
is
necessary...
to
those
what
horror
means.
Horror.
Horror
has
a
face...
and
you
must
Horror
and
moral
terror
lf
they
are
not,
then
they
They
are
truly
enemies.
I
remember
when
l
It
seems
We
went
into
a
camp
We'd
left
the
camp...
after
we
had
inoculated
and
this
old
man
and
he
was
crying.
He
couldn't
say--
We
went
back
there.
They
had
come
and
hacked
off
There
they
were
in
a
pile,
and
I
remember...
l--l--
I
cried.
I
wept
like...
I
wanted
I
didn't
know
And
I
want
to
remember
it.
I
never
want
to
forget
it.
I
never
want
to
forget.
And
then
I
realized,
like
I
was
shot
a
diamond
bullet
I
thought,
the
genius...
Perfect,
genuine,
Then
I
realized
because
they
could
stand
it.
These
were
men,
These
men
fought
who
have
families,
who
are
filled
but
they
had
the
strength...
to
do
that.
lf
I
had
10
divisions
then
our
troubles
here
You
have
to
have
men
and
at
the
same
time,
who
are
able
to
utilize
to
kill
without
feeling,
without
judgment.
Without
judgment.
Because
it's
judgment
I
worry
that
my
son
what
I've
tried
to
be,
and
if
I
were
I
would
want
someone
and
tell
my
son
Everything
I
did,
Because
there's
nothing
the
stench
of
lies.
And
if
you
understand
me,
you
wilI
do
this
PBR
Street
Gang,
this
is
PBR
Street
Gang,
this
is
Almighty
PBR
Street
Gang,
this
is
Almighty
How
do
you
copy?
They
were
going
to
make
me
and
I
wasn't
even
in
Everybody
wanted
me
him
most
of
all.
I
felt
like
waiting
for
me
He
just
wanted
to
go
out
Standing
up.
Not
like
some
poor
wasted
Even
the
jungle
and
that's
who
he
really
[
Come
on,
baby,
[
Come
on,
baby,
[
Come
on,
baby,
[
And
meet
me
at
the
back
[
Do
the
blue
rug
[
Do
the...

"We
train
young
men
"but
their
commanders
"to
write
fuck
because
it's
obscene."
The
horror.
The
horror.
Calling
PBR
Street
Gang,
Do
you
read
me?
PBR
Street
Gang,
PBR
Street
Gang,
The
horror.
The
horror.
