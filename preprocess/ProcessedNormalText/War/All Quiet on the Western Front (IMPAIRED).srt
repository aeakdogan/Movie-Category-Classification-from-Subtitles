...defending
our
country,
Now,
my
beloved
class,
Strike
with
all
our
power.
Give
every
ounce
of
strength...
to
win
victory
It
is
with
reluctance
that
You
are
the
life
You
are
the
iron
men
You
are
the
gay
heroes
when
you
are
called
upon
It
is
not
for
me
to
suggest
should
stand
up
and
offer
But
I
wonder
if
such
a
thing
I
know
that
the
boys
have
risen
up
and
enlisted
in
a
mass.
But,
of
course,
if
such
a
thing
you
would
not
blame
me
Perhaps
some
will
say...
that
you
should
not
that
you
are
too
young,
that
you
that
you
should
not
be
Are
your
fathers
so
forgetful
that
they
would
let
it
perish
Are
your
mothers
so
weak
to
defend
the
land
And
after
all,
such
a
bad
thing
Is
the
honor
of
wearing
something
from
which
And
if
our
young
ladies
is
that
anything
I
know
you
have
never
desired
That
has
not
been
We
have
sought
and
let
a
claim
come
But
to
be
is
a
virtue
I
believe
it
will
be
that
there
will
be
But
if
losses
there
must
be,
then
let
us
remember
which
must
have
come
when
he
stood
embattled
"Dulce
et
decorum
est
"Sweet
and
fitting
it
is
Some
of
you
I
know
of
one
young
man
who
has
and
he
has
written
the
first
act
which
would
be
a
credit
And
he
is
dreaming,
of
following
in
the
footsteps
and
I
hope
he
will.
But
now
our
country
calls.
The
fatherland
needs

yellowest
baboon
and
you're

a
plate
too.
All
right.
Take
it
all.
Give
'em
honey.

Fill
it
up!

-
Don't
mind
me.
You
know...
I
could
do
with
Go
help
yourself.

-
It's
too
far.
-
I
wonder,
when
are
we
It's
enough
to
take
away
You
know,
if
they're
gonna
we
ought
to
go
see
-
That's
a
good
idea.
-
How
far
is
the
dressing
station?
-
We
could
take
his
things
to
him.
It
seemed
rotten
to
think
of
a
thing
a
nice
fellow
Ah,
the
French
certainly
deserve
Everybody
says
Well,
how
do
they
Well,
one
country
How
could
one
country
You
mean
there's
a
mountain
-

Oh,
if
that's
it,
I
don't
feel
offended.
It
don't
apply
Good.
Then
I
can
be
-
Ah,
you
just
try
it.
-
The
kaiser
and
me...
Me
and
the
kaiser
felt
We
didn't
either
of
us
-
He's
there
already.
Maybe
it
was
No,
I
don't
want
I
never
saw
one
And
I
suppose
most
of
them
never
saw
-
No,
I'm
sure
they
weren't
Well...
it
must
be
doing
-
Not
me
and
the
kaiser.
You
leave
us
I
don't
see
that.
The
kaiser's
got
Well,
he
never
Every
full-grown
emperor
-
Why,
that's
history.
-
And
manufacturers.
They
get
rich.
I
think
it's
more
Nobody
wants
it
and
then
all
at
once,
We
didn't
want
it.
And
here
we
are
fighting.
I'll
tell
you
how
Whenever
there's
-
you
should
rope
off
a
big
field...
Yeah.
And...
And
on
the
big
day,
you
should
take
all
the
kings
put
them
in
the
center
and
let
'em
fight
it
out
-
The
best
country
wins.
Well,
now
that
Kat's
settled
everything,
-
Something
interesting
Boys,
me
and
the
kaiser
want
you
Don't
forget.
-
We'll
be
back.
-
We'll
be
back.

There
he
is.

Hello,
Kemmerick.
How
are
things
going?
How
are
they
treating
you?

They're
robbers
here.
Robbers.
They
stole
my
watch!
I
always
told
you,
nobody
-
They
took
it
while
I
was
under
ether!
Do
you
feel
all
right?
-
Just
look
at
my
hand.
-
Just
eat
decently
You
must
eat.
That's
the
main
thing.
I
have
such
a
terrible
pain
Every
toe
Well,
how
can
your
foot
hurt

I
know!
They
cut
my
leg
off.
Why
didn't
they
tell
me?
-
Franz!
Franz!
You
must
be
thankful
that
you've
I
wanted
to
be
You
can
yet.
They
make
artificial
legs
And
you're
through
too.
We
brought
your
things
Put
'em
under
the
bed.
That's
a
marvelous
pair
Look
at
that
leather!
What
comfort.
I
was
just
thinking.
If
you're
not
going
to
be
using
these,
What
good
are
they
to
you?
My
boots
give
me
blister
Well,
we'll
be
going,
Oh,
don't
go.
Stay
just
-
I'll
come
right
back.
-
I
know
you'll
be
feeling
better.
-
Bye.

-
I
don't
think...

Boys,
you
go
along.

I'm
sorry,
Paul.
I
wouldn't
touch
a
thing
I'd
go
barefoot
over
barbed
wire
Only...
Only
why
should
I
understand,
Mueller.
And
good
boots
Tell
the
doctor
to
come,
Doctor,

the
next
bed
I've
done
everything
I
can
for
him.

little
fella.

says
next
time,
Do
you
think
Why,
of
course.
-
Do
you
really
think
so?
I
don't
think
so.
Franz!
Don't
talk
nonsense.
They
fix
up
worse
things
Perhaps
you'll
go
in
Klosterberg
Then
you
can
look
out
of
the
to
the
two
trees
The
loveliest
time
of
the
year
