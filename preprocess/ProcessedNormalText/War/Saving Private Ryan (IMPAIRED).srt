the
trick
to
falling
asleep
Mellish:
Wade:
Well,
when
my
she
used
to
work
late
sleep
through
the
day.
So
the
only
time
that
we
ever
got
was
when
she'd
get
home.
So
what
l
used
to
do,
and
try
to
stay
awake
but
it
never
worked
the
faster
Yeah,
well,
that
wouldn't
have
My
ma,
she
would've
come
home,
chatted
me
up
till
dawn.
l
swear,
that
woman
Yeah,
that's
probably
she
could
get
a
word
in.
Funny
thing
is,
sometimes
she'd
and
l'd
pretend
Mellish:
Who?
Yeah.
She'd
stand
in
the
doorway
And
l
would
just
And
l
knew
she
just
wanted
that
she
came
home
early...
just
to
talk
to
me.
And
l
still
wouldn't
move.
l'd
still
pretend

why

did
that.

beautiful.
And
she
sees
me,
l
got
a
hard-on

And
she
says
to
me,
And
she
says,
''When
you're

if
you're
ever

to

What
does
that
mean?
Well,
you
don't
just

You
think
about
something

done

when
l

in
a

this
one
night,
two
of
my

they
took
me

And
Dan's
So
he's
working
and
he's
trying

all

And
so
Alice

and
she
screams
and
she
tries
to

she's

She
goes
running
and
knocks
herself
out.
So
now
Dan
He--
He
starts
but
at
the
same
time,
Alice
is
over
there
He's
got
to
wake
her
up.
So
he
grabs
her
and
he's
dragging
her.
At
the
same
time,
and
he's
going
And
Sean
said,
''What
are
you
l
just
did
you
a
favor.''
And
so
this
makes
Dan
He
tries
to
swing
He
loses
the

goes
out

thing
explodes.

and
the
solemn
pride
to
have
laid
upon
the
altar
of
freedom.
