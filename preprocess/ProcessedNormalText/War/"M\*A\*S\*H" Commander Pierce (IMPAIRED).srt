Colonel?
Good,
I'm
glad
you're
awake.
Sir,
I
hate
to
interrupt
you...
while
you're
in
a
good
mood,
-
Colonel?
Ohh!
-
Ohh,
Radar!
-
I
thought
you
were
awake.
I
heard
you
laughing.
Oh,
yeah.
Heh!
I
dreamt
I
came
home
from
the
war,
wearing
Hunnicutt's
mustache.
-
Why
would
you
be
laughing?
Is
this
important,
or
are
you
No,
there's
a
phone
call.
Bill
Imbrie?
-
I
don't
know.
Right.
Maybe
if
Mildred
waxed
it.




Oh,
if
only
I
could
sleep.
Why
should
you
rest
when
my
sinuses
Charles,
you're
blowing
Drip,
drip,
drip.
This
is
making
a
shambles
of
my
throat.

-

Evening,
boys.
Same
to
you,
Winchester.

Can
you
see
him
outside?
There's
been
a
big
shake-up
at
"l"
Corps.
and
Imbrie
wants
a
powwow
with
all
That's
fascinating,
Colonel,
What
makes
you
think
I
could
find
Just
this,
Senor
Hoity-toity.
As
of
0600,
I
will
be
en
route
to
Seoul,
-
Congratulations.
That's
like
giving
Colonel,
I'm
touched
that
you
thought
of
me,
It
wasn't
an
offer;
it
was
an
order.
And
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
my
sinuses
are
clogged,

Here.
Feel
that.
Feel
that
right
there.
Feel...
We
don't
know
each
other
that
well.
All
right,
Winchester.

Pierce,
you're

There
goes
the

You
have
a
cold?
Hangnail?
Warts?

You're
still
it.
-
I
don't
want
it.
-
What?
But
I'm
a
coward.
-
I
don't
know
how
to
give
orders.
Don't
worry.
-
Colonel,
how
long
will
you
be
gone?
I've
seen
these
things
-
We'll
leave
a
marker
where
the
camp
was.

gets
here
early.

-
Hawk,
I'm
truly
happy
for
you.
It's
like
one
of
those
westerns
All
right,
here's
my
first
command.
Get
your
steam
room
and
your
gargle
-
I
will
not.
Ten-hut!
Hut,
hut,
hut,

I
will
to
get
away
from
my
commander.
Left,
left!
Right,
right!

Now
I
know
why
they
shoot
people
at
sunrise.
-
Hey,
Hawkeye,
you're
not
even
dressed.
I
know,
but
it
doesn't
look
good...
-
From
now
on,
Don't
disturb
me
until
lunch.
How
am
I
doing
so
far?
Come
on.
Will
you
please
be
serious
once?
All
right.
The
first
order

Where's
the
key?
Potter
took
the
key?
Well,

great,
sir...
knowing
at
last
there's
somebody

Klinger...
Did
I
say
splendid?

Oh,
boy,
you
could
cut
it
with
a
fork.
Those
shoulders,
broad
enough
for
four
stars.
-
Look
down
on
his
men.
Klinger,
I'm
afraid
it
is
not
within
my
purview
I
know
that,
sir.
Let
me
put
it
another
way:
Good
try
though.
It
shows
initiative,
-
Does
this
mean
you
won't?
I
should've
known.
Sorry,
sir.
That's
just
the
way
I
see
it.
That
makes

could
you
give
me
something?

Too

Uh,
Hawkeye?
-
All
right,
Father.
What's
your
problem?
The
fact
of
the
matter
is...

I
am!
What
do
you

Look,
Major,
we're
pretty
cold
up
here.
I'll
fill

else?
Oh,
yeah.
The

Hey,
you
can't
lie

Now,
what
about

All
right!
Don't
yell!
Let's
not

Bye.
I
tell
ya...
if
I
weren't
the
boss
here,
Welcome
to
the
trenches,
sir.
This
wouldn't
have
happened
instead
of
piling
them
on
my
desk.
-
You
told
me
to
pile
them
on
your
desk!
Boy,
I
hate
breaking
in

I
gotta
get
off
tonight.

Take
my
late
duty
and
then
Baker,
you
can't
trade
shifts
for

I
worked
yours
last
Thursday.

-
No,
it
doesn't!
You
said
you
would
work
mine...

All
right,
all
right.
At
ease.
As
of
now,

The
duty
roster
is
the
final
word.

The
final
word!
if
this
arguing
keeps
up,
you'll
all
be

I
know,

there's
an
easy
way

But
he
can't
resist.
Baker
and
Bigelow,
Kellye,
you
work
a
third
of
a
shift,
Then
tomorrow
you
reverse
the
whole
thing.

That's
the
dumbest
schedule
I
ever
heard.

Can
you
get
a
full

please.
Don't
talk
while
I
talk.

I
gotcha.
I'll
do
exactly
what
you
say.
That's
better.
How

through
a
little
faster.
I
mailed
the

Tomorrow?
What's
wrong
with
today?

Tell
that
to
these
guys
who
are
out
here

You
are
not
among
them.

I
think
the
expression
is
"God
bless
you,
creep."
Can
we
hold
it
down,
please?
How
can
I
be
expected
to
drain
these
miserable
I
wouldn't
take
it,
Charles.
Why
doesn't

Why
doesn't
somebody
stand
on
yours?
-
Clamp.

Will
you
dry
up?
-
Will
you
all
shut
up?
Can
we
be
serious?
-
All
right.
Knock
off
the
loud
bleeding.
I
got
enough
to
worry
about

a
room
full
Not
to
mention

Look,
if
you
think
it's
so
easy,
you
do
it.
At
least
I'm
trying.
Meantime,


I'm
comin',
I'm
comin',

comin'.
Yeah,

No,
Colonel
Potter's

of
the
judges

she
might
win.
No,
Radar.
Home

How-How

things?
Fine.
Pretty

Direct

I
think
he's
hurt
worse
than
I
am.
-
What
makes
you
think
your
buddy's
hurt
so
bad?
-
but
he's
sweatin'
and
looks
gray,
ya
know?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
I
touched
it
and
he
screamed.
-
Fakin',

Radar,

him
inside.
Wait
a
minute!
Don't
you
think
you'd
better
You
tell
him.
Hey,
wait
a
minute.!
-
This
the
man
who
just
came
in?
-
Hi,
Doc.
I
just
got
a
call.
There's
a
lot
more
casualties
-
Uh,
sir?
Excuse
me,
but
about
Captain
Hunnicutt.
Don't
yell,
but
you
know
that
jeep
that
just
-
Why?
He's
hurt
real
bad
and
they
left
him
Well,

does
he
think
Look,
he
didn't
know
we
had
Well,
he
would
have
if
he'd
Fantastic.
Charles
has
never
been
here,
Nothing
personal.

Remember,
you
heard
it
here
first.
Superficial.
He
can
wait.
-
You
finish
out
here.
-
He
better
go
in
now.
-
I
got
two
that
are
worse
off,
I'll
start
him
on
whole
blood
We'll
manage
till
you're
ready.
-
You
know
you're
beautiful
-
Colonel
Potter's
on
the
phone
for
you.
-
But
I
brought
him
all
the
way
out
here
for
you.
It's
been
so
long
I
didn't
recognize
your
voice.
Get
him
into
pre-op
right
away.
-
Captain
Pierce!
I
gotta
run,
but
I
just
want
to
say
I'm
thrilled
The
thousand
details
that
clog
my
days
-
And
time
permitting,
Gotta
run.
Been
nice
chatting
with
you.
Why
don't
I
gotta
get
back
home.
Gentlemen,
tell
the
general
we
should
Well,
Doctor,
as
much
as
I
hate
to
admit
it,
We
were
great
for
half
a
staff.
Damn
that
Hunnicutt.
Technically
he's
AWOL,
ya
know?
I
don't
believe
what
I'm
hearing!
-
Since
it
was
left
to
me.
It's
not
so
easy
to
play
the
clown
-
You
finished,
Major?
-
Permission
to
say,
"It
serves
you
right,
sir."
Easy
with
him.
-
Prep
him
fast.
-
Severe
internal
bleeding.
-
Yeah.
-
You
think
you
can
just
waltz
Don't
give
me
"not
now."
we
were
trying
to
patch
together
Hey,
I
wasn't
joy
riding.
When
I
go
up
You
should've
checked
with
me
first.
I
did
exactly
what
Captain
Pierce
I
don't
know
about
Commander
Pierce.
and
I'm
not
sure
I
want
to.

So
that's
how
I
look
Ah,
returning
to
the
scene
of
the
crime.
I
hereby
give
back
your
command,
sir.
If
you're
interested,
I've
prepared
I'll
wait
till
the
movie
comes
out.
Have
a
good
time
with
the
boys
in
Seoul?
Well,
while
you
were
out
gallivanting,
The
young
clerk
with
the
paper
fetish.
Not
to
mention
my
roomie,
-
He's
gotta
go
out
and
find
it.
If
you
let
these
people
have
dessert
tonight,
-
Can
we
water
down
that
temper
tantrum?
-
I
like
being
mad.
And
that's
another
thing!
You
could
have
Are
you
kidding?
-
To
a
job
well
done.
-

-
I've
wanted
another
for
days.
-
Where?
No,
thank
you!
Never
fraternize
with
your
subordinates.
Will
you
relax?
-
You
don't
know
what's
been
going
on
here!
-
Come
on.
To
the
4077
th.
-
Hi,
Hunnicutt.
I'm
home.
-
Brought
you
a
snort.
-
A
little
change
from
You
two
do
know
each
other,
don't
you?
-
Yeah,
we've
met,
yeah.
-
I
can't
tell
you
how
glad
I
am
you're
back.
-
It
means
I'm
glad
he's
back.
You
just
won't
admit
that
going
out
there
I
did
what
I
thought
was
right.
You're
only
angry
-
It's
my
job
to
make
the
decisions.
-
Up
the
rebels!
Spite
you?
I
don't
believe
this.
How
do
you
get
You
just
won't
admit
You
see
what
I've
been
putting
up
with?
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
he's
been
like
-
Genghis
Khan
was
bigger
laughs.
Considering
what
I
had
to
work
with,
-
Well,
that
makes
one
of
you.
-
If
you
weren't
so
busy
trying
Why
aren't
you
helping
me?
You
should
be
And
I'm
acting
like
one,
It's
all
in
the
timing,
son.
Pull
the
reins
too
tight
You
had
good
people
under
you.
You
know,
this
is
pretty
good.
To
my
golden
tongue!
-
Okay,
okay.
Let's
say
I
overreacted...
a
little.
-
Amen.
You're
lucky
you
didn't
run
off
when
I
was
here,
Well,
don't
sit
there
Drink
up
and
shake
hands
already.
That's
an
order,
boys.
Do
you
know
how
ridiculous
You
wanna
make
nice?
-

-
Hopefully
there
won't
be
a
next
time.
-
Oh,
no.
-
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You
meant
-
Come
on.
What
was
it?
-
You
know
that?
-
I'm
a
pip?
Because
I
don't
want
you
-
Generalissimo
Benjamin
Franklin
Pierce
I'm
sorry
about
all
these
forms,
sir...
-
but
Captain
Pierce
got
us
about
two
days
behind.
Colonel,
we
have
to
do
something
By
the
time
my
nurses
get
in,
Besides,
they
leave
the
place
a
shambles.
Your
nurses
are
taking
cold
showers,
-
What
are
you
gonna
do
about
it,
Colonel?
I'll
look
into
the
ladies'
shower,
I
hope
so.
Dismissed,
and
thank
you,
Margaret.
-
Colonel,
I
missed
you.
-
About
my
heart
murmurs,
sir...
-
My
double
vision
is
coming
back.
-
I've
fallen
in
love
with
a
goat.
-
Glad
to
have
you
back,
sir.
-
I'll
send
these
right
off.
Well
done.
Oh,
and,
Radar,
one
other
thing.
Bring
me
back
-
This
place
is
gonna
drive
me
nuts.
