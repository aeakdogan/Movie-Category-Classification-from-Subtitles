Well...
uh,
January
20th.
Someplace
off...
I
don't
Up
in
the
DMZ.
Walked
into
Got
shot
in
the
foot.
I
got
up
like
I
was...
back
in
the
woods
again,
like
I
was
emptying
a
mag,
Motherfucker,
Rat-tat-tat-tat.
I
heard
this
crack
and
I
just
drop
out
from
under
me.
Christ,
I
thought
Was
the,
uh...
How
was
It
sucked.
I
know.
Really
bad.
I'll
tell
you
sometimes
at
night...
I
get

of
and

feel
like...
I
feel
like

do
you
do?
Nothing.

I
do
Do
anything
Y-you
get
through

I
was
I
thought,
"Yeah.
What
makes
sense?
'Cause
I
failed,
Timmy.
What
are
you
'Cause
I...
'Cause
I
killed
someone...
I
made
some
terrible...
mistakes.
Ronnie,
we
all
made
mistakes.
you
had
no
choice.
Those
pansy
will
never
understand.
Don't
talk
about
it.
It
was
insane
Sometimes
I
wish...
When
I
got
shot
I
could
have
laid
down.
Who
gives
a
fuck
now
I
was
paralyzed,
'Cause
I
was
so
s...
I'd
have
my
dick
and
my
balls
I
think,
Timmy,
everything
I
got...
just
to
have
just
to
be
whole
again.
But
I'm
not
whole.
I
never
will
be,
the
way
it
is,
isn't
it?
For
Christ's
sake,
it's
your
birthday.
You're
alive.
You
made
it.

made
sense.
Do
you
remember
things
you
before
we
all
What
are
we
going
What
am
I
going
What
am
I
going
to
do?
Where
you
from,
Wilson?

Venus,
Georgia.

Georgia?

and
I
haven't
seen
Yeah?

Yeah,

Sir,
I
think
I
think
I
don't
think
so.


You
don't
have
to
worry
They
won't
bite.
Y'all
get
away
now.
Get
on
away!
It's
all
right.
They're
probably
just
Mr.
Wilson,
Thanks
for,
uh,
Any
friend
of
Billy's
Well,
uh,
why
don't
you
My
wife
fixed
some
chicken,
Yes,
sir,
it
was
Marine
honor
guard
in
their
fancy
uniforms.
Fired
their
rifles
Thank
you.
The
drums
was
beating.
'Course
it
was
nothing
100
years
ago
But
there
was
Billy
Andy
Henderson.
And
the
Rutledge
boy,
Yeah,
Lance.
For
the
life
of
me,
I
still
can't
quite
Why
we
had
to
go
and
why's
we
had
to
lose
Can't
figure
it
out.
But
we
got
a
proud
tradition
Billy's
great-grandfather
My
pa
was
Don't
forget,
you
were
Guadalcanal.
Is
that
right?
Yeah.
Well,
I
guess
in
every
war
that,
uh,
I
reckon
we're
ready
if'n
we
have
to.
'Course
they
never
did
know
There
was
a
letter
I
think
it
was.
Colonel
Moore.
That's
right,
He
said
there
was
Said
that
Billy
He
also
told
us
that
That's
good
I
was
his
squad
leader.
I
didn't
know
Billy
He
was
new,
We
didn't
talk
much
He
was
19,
That's
right,
19.
Only
son?
Yes,
sir.
I
think
he
said
and
you
were
pregnant?
I
remember
Uh...
it
was
We
were
out
on
patrol
and,
oh,
There
was
screaming
Uh...
It
was
getting
late,
and
there
were
these
these
babies...
that
we
killed
How
awful.
And
then
it...
got
really
crazy.
And
we
had
to
pull
back
because
the
NVA
And
we
got
scattered
People
were
yelling
firing
at
anything.
And
that
was
when
it...
I
was,
uh,
confused...
scared.
I
raised
my
rifle
and...
shots...



The
body
fell
God,
this
is...
This
is
very
difficult
We
don't
have
But
I
think
I
was
the
one
I
was
the
one.
I
was
the
one.
What's
done
is
done,
sir.
I
can't
ever
forgive
you...
but
maybe
the
Lord
can.
We
understand,
Ron.
We
understand
the
pain

tricked
them
to
fight
a
war
against
who
have
a
proud
history
who
have
been
struggling
for
1,000
years...

I
can't...
I
can't
find
how
the
leadership
Now,
people
say...

people
say
if
you
then
get
the
hell
out.

Well,
I
love
America,

but
when
it
comes
it
stops
right
there.
