I've
been
in
a
lot
of
places
I
like
something
about
every
one
of
them.
But
there's
only
one
city
I
miss.
General
Batista
had
been
running
But
this
was
1958.
We
weren't
paying
attention
All
we
knew
about
Havana
was...
...
the
lights
in
the
Prado
never
went
out...
...
and
you
had
a
damned
good
chance
Check.
Check.
Bet
$10.
$10,
ra.
Ise
$20.
You
guys
know
something
I
don't?
-
Ra.
Ise
$25.
Sorry,
Captain,
but
Tony
the
bar
boy
Wa.
It
a
m.
Inute.
What
was
your
bet?
-
See
you
and
ra.
Ise
you
$25.
But
they
say
they're
SIM
-
$25?
Christ.
Look,
I
call.
I'll
be
right
back.
-
What
the
hell.
Is
SIM?
Batista's
gestapo.
This
is
an
American
ship,
-
There
are
arms
on
this
ship.
Here's
the
license
number.
Maybe
You
can't
hold
a
ship
That
deck
is
off-limits
except
to
the
crew.
You're
violating
every
...and
unless
you
can
show
me
...I'm
reporting
you
to
the
US
Embassy.
We've
been
adv.
Ised
there's
contraband
Advised
by
who?
Just
because
your
military
can't
control
It's
mine.
-
This
your
car,
sir?
That's
my
gun.
Why?
Is
there
a
problem?
It's
prohibited
to
bring
weapons
into
Cuba.
Could
we
talk
about
this
outside?
-
I'm
sorry
for
the
fuss,
Captain.
Okay,
everything's
settled.
Just
relax.
Have
a
nice
time.
Mrs.
Duran?
Marion
Chigwell.
We
met
the
last
t.
Ime
I
was.
In
Havana
Of
course.
Hello.
I
don't
know
if
Nettie
told
you.
I'm
writing
an
article
on
Caribbean
cuisine
Really?
She
said
you
know
a
woman
What
w.
Ill
happen
to
that
man
They'll
probably
give
him
a
hard
time.
-
Can
I
buy
you
a
drink?
It's
no
joke,
my
friend.
I
see
no
permit
here,
sir.
Maybe
I
got
it
right
here.
Maybe
I
need
a
new
permit.
Come
on,
guys.
It's
Christmas
Eve.
We
are
no
longer.
Issu.
Ing
perm.
Its,
seor.
The
fresh
air
woke
me
up.
See
if
you
like
this.
-
I'm
crazy
about
it.
Another
for
the
lady,
por
favor.
What
were
you
do.
Ing
states.
Ide?
-
Palm
Beach
parties?
Just
last
minute
Christmas
shopping?
$300.
That's
a
lot
of
money.
Could
you
excuse
us?
Use
the
one
downstairs,
please.
Thanks.
-
$400.
-
You're
ungrateful.
...make.
It
$350.
$500.
It's
a
kind
of
picante
sauce.
-
Wa.
It
a
m.
Inute,
man.
Where's
my
gun?
You
go
out
on
the
deck,
...way
over.
He
uses
fresh
cilantro
instead
of
parsley.
I'm
so
sorry.
Excuse
me
again.
Dance,
Sailor?
You
look
surprised.
Not
women
as
beautiful
as
you.
Thank
you,
sir.
And
the
ones
that
do
usually
find
it
easier
What?
I
said
all
that
fuss
over
one
little
gun.
They
got
a
tip,
they
say.
-
Is
that
the
end
of
it,
you
think?
-
The
searching.
-
Bringing
in
something
you
shouldn't?
That's
going
the
other
way.
It
wasn't
your
gun,
was
it?
-
Excuse
me,
miss.
I've
got
some
friends...
-
No,
thanks.
Okay.
What?
-
It's
silly,
really.
Because
you
don't
seem
silly
to
me.
Let
me
guess.
You
want
to
drive
your
car
off
the
boat
Come
here.
You
can't
be
doing
this
for
a
living.
I'm
not
doing
it
for
a
living.
People
know
you
in
Havana?
I
live
there.
$800.
You
really
want
this,
don't
you?
W.
Ill
you
do.
It?
It
would
be
against
my
principles,
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
The
way
it
works
is
half
now,
half
later.
That
way
I
won't
run
away
The
Lido.
Pardon
me?
Where
I'll
take
your
car.
Fine.
I'll
see
you
at
the
casino
The
payoff.
Thank
you.
Want
to
tell
me
what
k.
Ind

A
green
Town
and
Country.
Mine's
a
Cadillac
convertible.
Naturally.
Swell.
Please
get
out
of
the
car,
sir.
-
What's.
In
the
boxes?
What's.
In
the
boxes?
-
Probably
hand
grenades.
-
Take
a
couple
for
the
kids.
Jack.
-
Ramos,
where's
the
story?
Right
here,
It's
amazing.
No
one
is
afraid.
Should
we
be?
You
don't
take
any
of
this
seriously,
I
know.
It's
like
pesos
to
you.
Or
any
foreign
currency.
If
it's
not
an
American
dollar,
Jack,
I'm
telling
you
we
are
in
the
middle
This
revolution
is
real.
It's
too
early
for
this
bullshit.
-
Never
mind.
How
are
you?
I've
been
trying
to
reach
you
for
a
week.
I've
been
putting
together
a
stake.
It's
off.
There's
no
game
to
run.
Mike
McClany
on

Joe.
-
Later.
Nobody's
interested
We
got
a
I.
Ittle
confus.
Ion
go.
Ing
on
You
mean
the
revolution?
There
should
be
a
lot
of
loose
money,
You
know
what
they
do?
They
give
their
wives
money,
The
wife
shoves
a
few
grand
-
Forget
poker.
I'll
tell
you
something
Nothing
like
some
gunfire
Is
that
right?
Somebody
blew
up
-
See
any
big
players?
They're
not
playing.
They
don't
They're
not
playing
'cause
They're
sweating
out
there.
I
can
smell
it.
You
just
got
off
the
boat.
One
group
wants
this
guy,
Meanwhile,
this
Castro
is
broadcasting
Talking
insurrection.
Change
what?
That's
why
they'll
play.
You
want
to
play
poker,
The
players
I'm
talking
about...
...they
don't
walk
up
three
flights.
I
can
make
this
thing
happen.
They'll
walk
around
the
tables.
Nice
shoes,
Jack.
New?
There
are
other
places.
Not
really.
Meyer
still
runs
this
town.
Think
it
over,
Joe.
But
don't
take
too
long.
No
more
bets.
Twenty-two,
black.
Place
your
bets,
folks.
Gonna
bet
seven,
right?
That's
what
people
usually
bet
This
way
you
lose
also.
Nineteen,
red.
I
got
it.
Never
mind.
I
got
it.
Sorry.
Cigarette

Ginger

give
you
your

Here's

Six,

It's
all
here.
Aren't
you
impressed?
You
think
I'm
just
a

Why

I

You

Did
you

I
wouldn't

to
get

stuck
Yes.
Are
you
some

of
fanatic?
Thank
you
for
helping.
-
Green
Town
and
Country
for
the
lady.
-
I'd
like
to
see
you
again.
No,
you
didn't.
I'm
sorry.
It
was
unintentional.
That's
too
bad.
This
isn't
like
the
States.
I
think
it's
the
climate.
I
keep
a
place
here.
A
small
flat.
It's
in
one
of
the
old
buildings.
You're
very
straightforward,
I
can
be
suave.
Believe
me.
But
I
figure
you
know
I
got
no
edge
that
way.
But
how
many
crude
guys
do
you
know?
You
are
seriously
beautiful.
Please.
It's
very
important
If
it's
important
to
you,
-
I
hope
you
know
what
you're
doing.
Silk
blouse,
fancy
car.
You
did
me
a
favor.
What
do
you
really
know
about
Cuba?
Who's.
In
charge
and
how
to
stay
out
That's
not
enough.
Can
I
have
that?
For
luck.

Do
you
believe
in
luck?
I
really
have
to
go.
Thank

Right

And
this

You're
a
little
tired,
Jack.
We'll
see
how
that
goes.
One
world
at
a

my
friend.
I
find
an
old-fashioned
strongman

To
us
that

is

stale.
Just

Hey,
what
about
Castro
and

Excuse

Nice

I

You

Okay,
let's
start
at

-
Want
to
try
a

Ito?
All
right.
-
How
about
you,
Diane?
Right,
just
testing
you.
I
sure
hope
so.
Dressed

S-l-M.
SIM.
What
do
they
want?
They
want
to
keep
something
That'd
be
too
bad.
My
God.
-
It's
Duran.
It's
Arturo
Duran.
Is
he
a
friend
of
yours?
I
know
his
family.
He's
a
doctor.
I
met
him
once.
They
say
he's
been
in
the
mountains,
I
think
he's
a
very
important
man
Are
we
going
to
eat
here
or
what?
-
Who's
the
woman?
Hello.
It's
been
a
long
time.
For
you?
Are
you
kidding?
-
Good
evening.
I
didn't
know
your
husband
-
Yes.
Sorry.
Ramos
is
okay...
...but
he's
a
reporter,
after
all.
-
Yeah.
Just
that
Ramos
gets
all
choked
up
You
know
Latins.
I
wanted
to
thank
you
for
what
you
did.
Can
you
have
supper
with
us?
-
No...
Please.
It
would
make
us
very
happy.
I
think
you
will
like
the
food.
-
I've
eaten
here.
You
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
Havana?
I
come
down
here
to
play
cards.
-
Gambling?
-
How
do
you
do
that?
These
guys
in
the
shades
Not
so
much.
Not
because
I'm
brave.
For
Batista
there
are
two
classes
...the
torturable
and
the
non-torturable.
I
come
from
a
well-known
family...
...an
old
one,
rich.
Too
rich.
I
hope
you
know
how
important
it
was,
It's
okay.
I'll
take
your
word
for
it.
You're
a
card
player.
If
I
asked
you
to
do
something
more...
No,
I
don't
play
cards
for
that.
That's
very
American.
-
But
you're
not
interested.
Everyone's
I.
Ife,
Mr.
We.
Il.
Isn't
politics
just
a
kind
of
hope?
It's
still
politics.
What
about
fa.
Irness?
I'm
sorry?
As
a
gambler,
Very
much.
Outside
of
the
casinos
here,
it's
not
so
fair.
Children
in
the
country
die
of
TB.
And
those
that
don't
die,
...they
come
to
Havana
-
Some
of
us
are
trying
to
change...
I'm
sorry.
I'm
being
a
bore.
You
see,
it's
just
that
we
have
...to
get
rid
of
him.
You
cannot
do
that
nicely.
Please
don't
misunderstand
me.
In
fact,
I'm
fascinated
by
men
like
you...
...how
you
keep
a
kind
of
innocence.
Perhaps
it
isn't
innocence
at
all.
...really
doesn't
give
a
damn.
I
know
politicians.
I
play
cards
with
them.
And
I
love
to
because
they're
easy
to
beat.
It's
the
only
place
an
ordinary
man
I
think
I
ought
to
join
my
friends.
-
It
was
good
of
you
to
take
the
time...
Because
sometimes
in
poker
it's
smarter
...so
you
can
win
later
with
a
losing
one.
And
politicians
never
can
quite
...because
they
want
the
power
now.
I
think
you
know
more
Someone
has
to
be
responsible
Maybe
so,
but
I
don't
really
feel
qualified
Then
why
did
you
help?
-
It
was
a
business
deal.
She
told
me
the
envelope
was
in
her
purse
Perhaps
you
do
believe
Perhaps
you
believe
Blow

A

And

The

says

Do

Taken

Why
would

Because
the

And
it's
getting
worse.
Because
they'd

The

Do

Could

What'd

Do

Where

I

I

where

I

Do
you

there?
Are
you
in

No.
Christmas.

It's
Christmas

You
ought
to

You

So

Garbo?
Oh,

Swedish!
She
was

Robert
Taylor.

No

He
was

I

To

How
did
it
go
for

I
did.
I

I

I'd

It's

He
almost
did
it.
We
were
so
close.
I'm
sorry.
He
was
a
good
guy.
Yes,
he
was.
You
have
no

He
said...
...he'd
like
to
play
poker
I'd
rather
take
a
nap
in

Here.
I'll
close
the
shutters.
That's
why
I

Looking

Only
this
time
you
did
a
favor
I
was
brought

way.
You
know
she's
political,
this
woman?

And
she's
also
beautiful.
This

exceptional.
$2,000

Even
if
she's
exceptional,
it's
high.
First

Come

She's

I
did

That's

You

And

Disappeared,

Disappeared!
I'm

It's

Havana.

Damn

I

Can

But

Here's
what
you're
gonna
do
tomorrow:
You're
gonna
talk
to
Batista's
people.
You're
gonna
explain
to
them
...and
they
better
get
off
their
asses
...or
they'll
go
back
to
being
a
bunch
Remind
them
that
the
only
reason
...is
because
the
Americans
came
here
Batista's
palace
had
an
outdoor
crapper
The
only
reason
he's
got
an
army
He
better
start
using
it
or
he'll
wind
up
We.
Invented
Havana!
And
we
can
goddamn
well
move
it
Now
you
explain
that
to
him.
Do
you
want
to
go
for
a
walk,
Jack?
Why
not?
What
do
you
th.
Ink,
Joe?
No.
The
game's
still
on.
He's
full
of
tantrums.
Listen.
The
professor,
is
he
around?
The
professor's
here.
Some
things
never
change.
Not
him.
He's
seen
it
all.
I
need
to
talk
to
him.
I
like
this
town,
Jack.
They
call
it
the
pearl
of
the
Antilles...
...the
Paris
of
the
Caribbean.
-
It's
a
city.
Believe
me.
New
York
is
good.
Chicago.
How
long
can
they
hold
off
the
rebels?
I
don't
know.
If
Batista
takes
a
powder,
Forget
the
army.
Forget
the
generals.
This
town's
crawling
with
spooks
now.
Used
to
be
all
you
had
was
the
FBI
-
You
take
any
heat
from
them?
These
guys
went
to
Yale.
They
fuck
each
other.
You
know,
they
won't
let
me
back
I'm
not

Not

What'll

If

Ity?
Meyer's

Ever

It's

I

Retired.

He's

Not

Hi,

Yes.
History's

Want

Take

Dr.
Ive

Nonsense.
Atom
bombs

I
always
stay
here
too
long.
Every
time
I
came
down
here
I
thought:
"I
can
find
the
best
fuck
I'm
ahead,
way
ahead,
man.
It's...
...stupid
for
me
to
stick
around
too
long.
I
met
this
woman.
I
know
her
72
hours...
I
don't
know.
You
stick
with
her.
Take
the
advice
of
an
old
man.
There's
nothing
like
a
woman,
or
two.
The
biggest
jerk
you
ever
knew
somehow
Women
are
perfect.
The
rest.
Is
bullsh.
It.
I
can't.
She
took
off.
I
think
I
know
where
she
is.
Goddamned
if
I
know
why.
It's
time
to
get
out,
Professor.
So
when
are
you
leaving,
sonny?
After
the
game.
I
just
get
this...
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Hell,
I
don't
have
to
do
anything.
But
you
do.
I
got
somebody
I
gotta
get
out
of
there.
Santa
Clara.
I
got
a
friend
in

Speak

I
gotta
get

out.
Seora,

Where's

Woman,

Finca!
Duran.
Oh,

It
means

Bye-bye,
Yankee!
I
got
your
note.
How
did
you
get
through?
By
not
speaking
Spanish.
I
didn't
think
I'd
see
you
again.
That's
how
I
thought
it
would
go,
too.
This
is
Arturo's

What

Ing?
I
don't

Are

They'll

When
I

In

saw
Bufano.
Who's
Bufano?
He's
with

He's
supposed
to
be
with
us.
Talking
with
the
police.
So
you
tell
the
rebels
-
I
don't
know.
He
missed
you
-
I
think
I'm
safe
here.
Jesus!
I
just
drove
through
it!
There
are
soldiers
all
over
the
road!
If
he
looks
for
you,
-
What
do
you
expect
me
to
do?
Just
for
a
little
while.

I

been?
-
I
don't
want
to
live
that
way.
If
you
need
war,
Don't
tell
me
how
to
make
sense
All
you
see
here
is
a
place
for
a
card
game
That's
not
what's
going
on!
People's
lives
are
ending!
Families
are
tearing
apart!
You
don't
really
understand
any
of
this...
...because
you
spend
your
life
I
feel
more
honest
playing
cards
than
I
do
Oh,
shit!
Does
this
phone
work?
They
haven't
slept
for
weeks.
Can
you
imagine
how
they
feel?
How
close
they
are,
how
far
they've
come!
Listen,
Bobby.
I
don't
know
about
a
lot
of
things.
But
the
things
I
know,
I
know
well.
I
try
to
keep
out
of
the
way
Mostly.
All
this
is
like
living
your
life
Like
you
read
what
to
do.
But
they
make
too
much
out
of
everything.
Most
of
the
time,
nothing's
going
on.
Just
everyday
stuff.
You
take
a
walk.
You
buy
a
necktie.
You
eat
a
sandwich.
Life.
Jesus!
You
can't
live
ideas.
Most
things
that
are
alive
What's
really
go.
Ing
on
Before
talk.
Before
anybody
says
anything.
And
after.
In
the
quiet.
It
isn't
an
idea.
It's
a
feeling.
It's
like...
...being
part
of
something
Like
a
song
some
people
sing
together.
I
don't
think
this
is
anything
I
can
explain.
You
mean,
not
to
me.
I'm
not
in
there
singing,
am
I?
Something
is
happening.
I
bailed
you
out,
what...
...48
hours
ago?
I
made
you
a
sandwich.
I
drove
all
the
way
to...
Then
why
are
you
here?
You
want
to
change
the
world,
Bobby?
Change
mine.
How
can
I?
What
about
my
world?
If
I
go
with
you...
...
what
will
happen
to
mine?
It's
gonna
be
okay,
Bobby.
What
are
they
bomb.
Ing?
I'm
not
doing
this.
This
is
somebody
else.
You
got
a
cigarette?
I
came
200
miles
after
you
I've
never
heard
it
this
quiet.
What's
th.
Is?
I
don't
know.
Nothing.
A
scar.
-
No,
it
isn't.
Tell
me.
Because
you
don't
want
to.
-
It's
a
diamond.
-
I
swallowed
it.
Tell
me.
I
knew
this
old
hustler
when
I
was
a
kid.
You
know,
a
mechanic.
A
crooked
player.
He
showed
me
how
he
had
this
diamond
So
when
I
was
in
Yokohama,
I
bought
See
the
idea
was...
...that
no
matter
how
bad
things
got,
...no
matter
what...
...you
still
have
this
last
chance.
You'd
always
have
this
diamond.
You
still
feel
that
way?
I
was
in
my
twenties.
I
do.
Tell
me
about
the
boat.
Our
boat?
What?
You
know
about
boats?
Do
I
know
about
boats?
Where
do
you
want
to
go,
pal?
You
want
to
go
to
California?
Are
you
going
with
me?
Sure,
I
am.
I
haven't
been
there
in
a
while.
Anywhere?
Anywhere
in
the
world.
-
Where
you
been?
-
Tell
me
about
the
game.
-
What
t.
Ime?
-
What's
go.
Ing
on?
Is
this
about
a
broad?
About
that
broad?
It's
about
a
card
game.
What
t.
Ime,
Joe?
They
want
to
start
early.
6:30,
same
suite.
You
feeling
lucky?
It's
com.
Ing.
In
from
the
Keys.
I
can
have
it
hosed
down
and
refueled
-
Midnight?
They
start
blowing
horns,
kissing,
-
Listen,
the
lady's
traveling
alone.
Can
you
get
her
set
up
okay?
Say,
the
Edgewater?
Nice
room?
It's
high
season
in
Miami.
But
I
know
a
guy
who
can
clear
up
a
room
Just
for
the
night.
I'll
try
to
get
out
No
later
than
midnight
for
the
lady.
After
that,
who
knows?
Boats
get
impounded,
funny
things
happen.
-
He
wants
her
out
of
the
country.
Do
you
understand
me?
-
Who?
Do
it!
-
What
happened?
You've
no
idea
how
fried
people
can
get
-
What
happened?
Everybody's
trying
to
get
out.
-
Do
you
have
some
antiseptic?
I
tried
to
buck
the
line.
Boy!
Some
people
have
a
short
fuse.
And
these
were
women
and
children.
It
was
really
over
a
boat?
Yeah,
a
72-footer.
Hell,
it's
worth
a
couple
of
punches.
It's
arranged?
About
midnight.
-
My
things
are
at
the
house.
I
know.
I
gotta
get
the
guy
with
the
boats
paid
off.
There's
a
fr.
Lend
of
m.
Ine,
Joe
Volp.
I...
...he's
holding
some
dough
for
me
Now,
it's
gonna
take
a
while.
You're
good
at
this.
I
like
doing
it.
Maybe
you
should
go
with
a
prizefighter.
No.
You.
Are
you
sure?
Do
you
mean...
...do
I
miss
Arturo?
Of
course
I
do.
You
shared
a
lot.
Revolution.
No.
He
just
made
me
feel...
I
wanted
to
be
simpler
More
honest.
Myself.
How
many
times
have
you
lost
everything?
Maybe
it's
possible
to
come
back
There
are
so
many
ways
to
be
happy,
I
feel
that
with
you
sometimes.
...I
feel...
...terrible
about
the
thought
of
being
Don't.
Don't
say
it.
I'll
be
back
as
soon
as
I
can.
One
ring,
and
if
it
rings
again...
...it's
you.
So
long.
You
say
someth.
Ing,
Mr.
We.
II?
Marion.
What'll
you
have?
-
How's
the
book
coming?
What
happened
to
you?
Aren't
gamblers
pacifists?
You
here
collecting
recipes?
No.
I'm
off
duty.
I
thought
you
guys
didn't
sleep?
Not
cookbook
writers.
You
guys.
What's
th.
Is
about?
Is
Arturo
Duran
alive?
-
Arturo
Duran.
Why
would
I...
Who
has
h.
Im?
-
You're
in
a
funny
mood,
Jack.
I'll
tell
you
how
funny.
I'm
going
to
stand
up
in
this
bar,
I'm
going
to
announce
how
a
fake
fairy
You
are,
aren't
you?
Quiet
down,
Jack.
I'll
break
your
face.
No,
you
won't.
That's
what
you
are,
isn't
it?
Menocal
works
for
SIM
and
for
you,
The
OSS,
the
CIA
Don't
do
anything
stupid.
I
think
I
will.
Everybody!
What?
Talk
to
me.
Smart.
Here's
what
I
want.
I'm
Jack
We.
II.
I
got
some.
Informat.
Ion
Holiday
traffic,
Mr.
Forbes.
Something
to
report?
Nothing
to
report.
Why
do
you
come?
I
work
for
some
people.
-
What
people.
I
see.
A
joke.
Not
at
all.
They
want
Arturo
Duran
alive.
Well.
C.O.D.
He's
dead.
Now
let's
not
fuck
around.
They're
not
interested
in
details.
Do
they
know...
...that
Mrs.
Duran
is
in
your
apartment...
...right
now?
Sure.
They
sent
me
to
Santa
Clara
Doesn't
do
her
justice.
Either
of
you.
It
was
a
good
idea,
See,
there?
Spit.
Let's
save
some
time,
okay?
Marion
Chigwell's
laid
it
all
out.
-
I
can
call
him.
Remember
W.
Ilson?
W.
Ilson's
prepared
to
offer
you
asylum.
What
the
fuck.
Is
go.
Ing
on
here?
You
people
pay
me
to
keep
...and
now
you
say,
You
need
him
for
what?
You're
crazy.
You're
like,
I
don't
know,
-
You
have
a
whim...
And
what
happens
to
me?
I'm
your
trash
collector,
but
when
I
go
Asylum.
V.
Irg.
In.
La.
And.
It's
beaut.
Lful.
-
And
I
live
on
what?
Another
joke?
Okay,
$50,000.
All
cash.
I'll
need
a
few
hours
to
get
the
authority.
-
Where.
Is
he?
-
How
do
I
know
you
can
deliver?
Touch.
Feel.
Talk
to.
They're
going
to
make
him
part
Christ,
you're
fools.
They
just
want
to
talk
to
him.
You
won't
get
a
fucking
thing
out
of
him.
He's
a
real
Cubano.
-
Yeah?
Then
what
do
you
want
him
for?
In
case
it
goes
the
other
way.
You
son
of
a
bitch.
What
are
you
do.
Ing
here?
No,
it's
all
right.
-
Where.
Is
she?
I'm
going
to
get
you
out
of
here.
-
He
thinks
I'm
with
the
CIA.
Why
the
hell
-
Where.
Is
she?
R.
Ight
now?
-
We're
do.
Ing
th.
Is
ton.
Ight.
-
Yes,
I
can.
Just
do
what
I
tell
you.
-
We
don't
have
t.
Ime
for
th.
Is.
Once
I
asked
you
for
help,
and
you
said
no!
I
changed
my
mind.
Bullshit!
Are
you
gonna
make
it?
Come
on.
What
are
you
gett.
Ing
out
of
th.
Is?
Nothing.
You're
a
liar.
She's
beautiful,
isn't
she?
More
than
that.
I
want
to
thank
you
for
seducing
my
wife.
I
mean
it.
The
anger
kept
me
going.
It
was
like
strong,
cold
coffee.
Sometimes
when
it
was
bad...
...the
only
way
to
keep
my
mind
together...
...was
to
concentrate
She's
a
hell
of
a
lady.
Does
she
know
I'm
alive?
She
buried
you,
man.
Deal.
Better
make
it
fast.
It's
like
meat
going
bad.
He
won't
keep.
Have
him
at
his
house,
cleaned
up,
11:00.
You
want
buy
a
young
girl?
What
happened?
I
was
so
worr.
Led.
-
We
have
a
boat?
I
washed
this
blouse
and
dried
it
Well,
almost
dry.
You
look
fine.
No,
I
don't
have
an
iron.
I
never
had
an
iron.
I
can
get
some
new
things
in
Miami.
Are
we
going?
There's
one
more
thing
to
do.
-
Then
do
it.
-
Is
a
72-footer
a
big
boat?
-
We'll
take.
It
to
M.
Lam.
I
and
then
where?
It
doesn't
matter.
A
long
trip
and
not
worry
Listen,
kiddo.
-
People
don't
say
that
anymore.
It's
from
the
'20s.
If
I
had
never
met
you...
...I'd
have
lived
my
life...
He's
alive.
Arturo's
alive.
He's
at
your
house.
And
he's
okay,
and
he's
waiting
for
you.
Oh,
God.
There's
nothing
to
say,
Bobby.
For
a
moment...
...for
one
moment...
...I
was
lost...
...in
a
sweet
place.
But
lost.
Wa.
It.
Let
me
take
you
there.
Nowhere.
Batista's
left
the
country!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Let's
go!
It's
all
over.
That's
my
car!
You
stood
up
a
lot
of
guys.
They're
upstairs
playing
right
now.
Yes,
it
is.
It's
1959,
Joe.
Where's
the
lady?
She's
with
her
husband.
Nobility.
I
always
said
you
were
a
noble
guy.
We're
noth.
Ing
but
cocks
...just
like
the
nuns
told
us,
right?
Who's
ahead?
Looks
like
fun.
Time
to
leave,
Jack.
Anejo
and
coffee.
Things
go
well?
Great.
How
about
you?
You
win
or
lose?
It's
never
over,
so
we
never
lose.
Then
you
never
win
either.
All
passengers
prepare
to
board.
Please
stand
by
your
cars.
-
Have
passports
ready.
He's
probably
at
the
embassy.
He's
been
there
and
gone.
Last
night.
Gone?
Where?
Probably
V.
Irg.
In.
La.
And
I'm
off
to
the
Far
East,
The
Cuisine
of
Indochina.
Indochina.
Where's
Indoch.
Ina?
It's
a
long
way
away,
Jack.
I'll
see
you.
Pick
a
card.
You're
not
celebrating.
It
wasn't
my
fight.
How
is
he?
He's
wonderful.
He's
with
them.
You
too?
But
I
thought
you
might
be
here.
It's
funny.
I
didn't
know
I
was
leaving
Were
you
wa.
It.
Ing
for
me?
All
my
life.
All
passengers
should
prepare
to
board.
Please
stand
by
your
cars.
That
old
trick.
The
other
one
was
a
quarter.
This
is
a
half.
Where
are
you
go.
Ing,
We.
II?
Don't
know.
California,
maybe.
How
did
you
get
Menocal
to
let
him
go?
I
lied...
...about
a
few
things.
You
don't
quite
believe
I
do.
I
know
I
love
you,
Bobby.
And
I
know
a
butterfly
can
flutter
its
wings
...and
cause
a
hurricane
in
the
Caribbean.
I
believe
it.
They
can
even
calculate
the
odds.
It
just
isn't
likely.
And
it
takes
so
long.
All
passengers
and
all
autos...
...
should
be
boarding
immediately.
Have
your
passports
ready.
You
know
where
to
find
me.
Walk.
Into
any
cas.
Ino...
...and
ask
any
high-stakes
poker
player...
..."Where.
Is
Jack
We.
II?"
Right.
So
long,
pal.
I
do
this
sometimes.
It
isn't
that
I
expect
her.
But
it
happens
sometimes.
I
see
a
boat
offshore
and...
...
something
goes
faster
in
me.
Hope,
I
guess.
What
the
hell.
Fidel
Castro
So
anything
can
happen.
I
even
read
the
newspapers
now.
Not
just
looking
for
point
spread,
Human
interest,
that's
what
I
read.
A
dozen
lines
about
what
happened
...
or
identical
twins
meet
after
30
years,
...
and
both
married
Like
that.
Somebody
came
out
of
Havana...
...
told
me
Baby
Hernandez
Lives
in
Jersey
now.
And
I
got
a
postcard
from
Joe
Volpi...
...
postmarked
Santo
Domingo.
So
I
guess
he's
still
doing
it,
It's
a
new
decade.
Things
are
different.
We
got
our
own
kind
of
revolution
going.
I'm
doing
okay
these
days.
I'm
way
ahead.
But
it's
not
the
same.
I
sit
with
my
back
to
the
wall,
You
never
know
who's
gonna
walk
in.
Somebody
blown
off
course.
This
is
hurricane
country.
