marschiert
Deutschland,
-

Feuer!







-

Please!
He's
my
son!

Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!



-
What
do
we
do?
We've
got
to
get
home.
Go!

Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my!

Papa!
-

Come.
It's
safe.
Let's
go.



Stop
it.
-


-

You
want
to
cry?
Stop!
Stop!

Let's
go.
Aron.
Let's
go.
Tuvia!
It's
Tuvia.
If
I
was
a
German,
you
would
be
dead.
-
Papa
and
Mama...
They
killed
them!

Aron.
Big
brother
returns.
You
saw
them?

Where
is
your
wife
and
child?
Horodyszcze.
Hiding
in
a
cellar.
-
And
Rifka?
-
She
wouldn't
leave.
-
She's
still
my
wife.
Tell
me,
Tuvia,
-
Do
you
have
a
plan?
Do
you?

-
The
police
will
be
after
us.
-
You
think
this
is
a
good
time
to
stop?
They'll
never
find
us
in
here.
Aron!
Aron!
I
told
him
to
stay
here.


I
miss
Papa.
I
can't
believe
he's
dead.
-
Bernicki.
-
The
police
captain?
-
But
we
don't
know
that
he
did
it.
Koscik
has
a
pistol.
He
showed
me
once.
One
pistol
is
nothing.
-
You'll
take
on
the
whole
German
army?
-
The
child
is
hurt.

Tuvia.
We
cannot
feed
them.
-
I'll
go
ask
Koscik
for
food.
And
the
pistol.

I
only
have
four
bullets.
Thank
you.
Your
father
was
a
good
man.
-
He
said
the
same
of
you.
Ignore
the
bitch.
To
the
dead.
God
rest
their
souls.
I
live
with
this.
Can
you
imagine?

The
barn.
-

Be
quiet!



Ah!
-
I'm
sorry,
they
have
to
go
with
you.
Those
policemen...
were
they
the
ones
You
people.
Why
is
it
so
fucking
hard
Try
being
one.
-

Who
is
he?
Thank
you.
Come.
Come.
You
sat
at
the
back,
in
school.
-
I
thought
you
were
dead.
I
heard
you
speaking
of
your
parents.
The
other
brothers.
-
Zus.
He's
with
the
other
two.

There
has
been
trouble
before,
maybe?
So
you
go
to
the
forest.
A
wise
choice.
A
wise
choice...
for
a
stupid
schoolboy.
My
whole
life,
I
presumed
to
teach
I
had
no
doubt.
You'll
forgive
me
if
recent
events
Just
like
school.
I
have
no
idea
Please,
let's
go.
Here.
You're
not
hungry?
Your
little
one
does
not
talk.
He
saw
things.
I
send
you
for
food
-
You
send
me?
It
was
Bernicki
who
killed
Papa.
Did
you
at
least
get
the
pistol?
Only
four
bullets.
Then,
we'll
have
to
make
them
count.


For
my
parents,
David
and
Beila
Bielski.
For
my
brothers,
and
for
all
the
others.

-


Shit!
-
Only
one
left.
How
was
it?
-
How
was
what?
-
It
was
good,
no?

-
And
what
about
these
others?
Women
will
slow
us
down.
What,
you
afraid
he's
gonna
spank
you
We
have
to
be
able
to
move,
Tuvia,
I
agree.
But
they're
here.
We'll
sleep
further
up
the
trail.
If
and
the
gunshots
Alright...
but
no
more.
No
more.

I
know.
I
know!
Tamara,
you
remember
Cousin
Zus.
-
Lazar.
He's
Isabel's
youngest.
-
And
this
is
Isaac
Malbin.
-
He's
from
Minsk.
-
Asael!
Find
them
something
to
eat.
-
They're
family!
We'll
water
the
soup.
And
this
one...
she
is
family?
-
No.

Whoa!
What
the
fuck?!
-
Er...
no.
I
suppose
you'd
have
to
say
I
was,
-
This
is
a
job?
I
published
a
small
magazine.
-
Ah.
-
Hm.

Tuvia?
This
is
Lila.
Lila
is
my
forest
wife.
I
see.
Congratulations.
Interesting
concept.
As
long
as
his
village
wife


-
Hello,
boys.
What
can
we
do
for
you?
These
little
shits
are
holding
us
up.
We
have
food.
We'll
share.
No.
I
want
to
see
if
the
little
shit
You
like
to
shoot
Jews,
little
shit?
-
You
are
Jews?
-
Put
down
the
gun.
-
Hey!
Look
at
me!
Where
you
from?
We
haven't
eaten
in
two
days.
This
is
Jacov.
Two
days
ago
there
were
3,000
Jews
Me
and
him,
we
hid
in
a
wall.
Do
you
know
a
woman...
Sonia
Bielski?
We
knew
her.
There
was
a
child.




My
child...
-
No.
Mama!
Papa!
-
So
many
dead!
Why
not
us?
I
don't
know.
Better
to
be
hiding
in
the
woods...
...like
rabbits...
...hunted.
No.
We're
looking
for
partisans.
-
What
is
an
otriad?
We
heard
the
Russians
-
Here?
Then
we
are
the
Bielski
Otriad.
-
The
Russians
are
fighters.
They
sabotage
railroads
You
want
to
kill
Germans?
Unless
you're
still
afraid
Stay
there.
Stay
there!
We
must
get
what
we
need
-
This
will
not
bring
your
family
back.
-
You
had
yours.
-
"Vengeance
is
mine."
Who
said
that?
No,
only
you
can
do
that.
-
We
must
not
become
like
them.
Are
you
coming
with
us
or
not?

It's
coming!
It's
coming!


Truck!
Hurry,
hurry!
Go!
Here!


Hey!



-


Nein!
Nein!
-

A-ha!
-
Vodka!
-

Cigarettes!

Asael!

-
Asael!

Get
his
rifle!
-

Shit!
He's
going
the
wrong
way!

-
Come
on!
We
have
no
choice!
Go!
-
Asael!

They
thought
you
were
bringing
food.
-
Hm?
They
had
guns?
Dogs?
I
don't
understand.

The
Talmud
says,
if
you
save
a
life,
Again,
I
have
no
idea
Oh,
yes.
I
think
you
do.
-
How
did
you
get
past
Lazar?
Fucking
shit...
-

He
walked
by
you!
I
said
enough!
Get
up!
Get
up!
He
should
be
shot.
If
we
you
stupid
little
piece
of!
He
made
a
mistake!
Mistake?
-
We
cannot
make
mistakes,
Tuvia.
First
they
will
torture
Asael...
...and
then
they
will
hang
him.
You
are
Tuvia
Bielski?
-
You
know
me?
-
My
sister
lives
in
Vilna!
-
The
SD
came
without
warning.

Oh,
God!
Oh,
God!
-
We'll
be
better
off
in
the
ghetto!
-
There,
we
had
had
hope.
-
Do
we?
-
Tomorrow
will
be
another
mission.
-
We
won't
make
that
mistake
again.
-

-
We
have
to
prepare.
Better
security,
We
don't
have
weapons.
-


Whatever
it
takes,
-
We
can't
work
against
each
other!
We
cannot
afford
revenge.
Not
now!
We
cannot
afford
to
lose
friends
Or
Asael.
We
cannot
lose
anyone.
We
will
map
out
where
we
have
been...
...so
as
not
to
visit
and
we
will
take
only
from
those
and
we
will
leave
those
who
can't
alone.
Our
revenge...
...is
to
live.
Quiet.
What
I
am
saying
is,
We
may
be
hunted
like
animals,
We
have
all
chosen
this...
...to
live
here
free,
like
human
beings,
Every
day
of
freedom
And
if
we
should
die,
...then
at
least
we
die
Thank
God.
Come
here!
Come
here!
Come,
Asael!
-

I
can't
breathe.
Where
did
you
get
these?
Hello.
-
It
is
alright.
Please
come.
-

It
is
alright.
Give
me
that.
-
Asael,
you've
been
busy!
Hello.
I
am
Zus.
This
is
Bella
and
this
is
Chaya.
-
Please,
come.
You
must
be
hungry.
And
then,
we
fell
into
and
Chaya
saved
me.
I
can't
swim
at
all.
-
Well,
we'll
have
to
teach
you.
I
was
resigned
to
die.
Tell
him,
Chaya.
-
And
that
farmer,
a
Mr
er...
Yes.
So
you're
trying
to
tell
me
In
the
West,
In
the
East,
the
monster
with
Your
Messiah
will
have
a
moustache,
No.
The
messiahs
are
all
in
politics,
-
No...

And
Roosevelt?
We
need
to
know
about
the
villages,
where
the
Germans
are,
-
Are
you
listening
to
me?
-
What's
her
name?
Chaya!
What
are
you
doing?
-
Talk
to
her.
You
spent
three
days
in
a
cellar
Malbin
says
-
But
we
still
need
two
guns
at
least.
-
Zus.
Make
sure
he
understands
my
orders.
Go!
Go
and
talk
to
her!
Go!
Hello.
How
are
you?
-
Fine.
Ssh...
Leave
half.
He
cannot
go
to
the
Halt!
Who
goes
there?
You
know
who
goes
there,
Lazar.
You
only
say
"Who
goes
there?"
Sorry,
Zus.
Milk!
And
eggs!
Chaya,
our
brave
men
-
You
can
make
me
blintzes.
Hey...
Hey!
I
don't
think
-
Hello.
-
You
are
Chaya.
You're
getting
along
alright?
Er,
no,
thank
you.
I
am
fine.
-
Oh.
Something
nice...
and
soft?
You
don't
have
a
husband
yet.
-
Yet?
All
the
other
women
have
chosen
No,
they
haven't.
Descartes
provided
for
Yes.
You
annoy
me,
therefore
I
exist.

Ben
Zion?
The
new
ones
have
just
arrived.
Your
wife...
I'm
sorry.
Thank
you
for
telling
me.

Can
I
join
you?
Of
course.
-
Oh,
I...
I
never...

Do
you
get
lonely
out
here?
I
like
the
woods.
I
get
a
little
bit
scared
sometimes.
Tell
me
something.
Why
is
there
a
rule
-
There
aren't
enough
for
the
men.
What
for?
For...
protection.
Women
have
men
for
protection.
I
want
protection.

-
Men
with
guns!
Men
with
guns!
Up!
Take
weapons
and
ammunition
only!
-
Lova,
Ben
Zion,
with
us.
Asael!
Keep
them
moving!
Don't
stop!
Go,
go.
Move!
Come
on!
Zus!
No!
Quick,
quick.
Come!
-

-
Move,
move!
Ben
Zion,
there!
Give
up
Bielski,
You're
from
Belorussia!
Why
do
For
the
same
reason
To
survive!
-
Shit!
It
will
be
dark
soon.
They'll
be
back.
-
Next
time
you
can
draw
them
a
map.
It
means
we
should
have
killed
Your
policy
of
diplomacy
is
shit.
Winter
is
coming,
Because
you
don't
have
the
stomach
Go!
Move.
Where
is
he
taking
us?
I
need
volunteers
for
a
scouting
party.
-

Ah!

-

-
So
now
we
are
partisans.

-
Here.
If
my
friends
at
the
New
Socialist
Club
I
haven't
read
a
book
in
months.
I
don't
read
much.
-
You
can
ask
Shimon.
-
Yet
you
accept
me
as
commander?

-
Might
I
make
an
observation?
We
need
to
be
strong,
yes.
But...
But?
-
Other
things
are
important,
too.
Community.
You
have
ideas
about,
er...
A
few.
Oh!
More
mouths
to
feed.
And
more
young
bodies

-
Which
one
is
Tuvia
Bielski?
I'm
Tuvia.
Hello.
None
of
us
knew
if
you
really
existed.
Excuse
me.
-
Welcome,
Yitzhak.
The
ghetto
is
being
liquidated.
The
Germans
said
everyone
So
the
council
stops
us
...every
day,
more
people
are
killed.
My
parents!
-
We
will
do
what
we
can.
No!
-
Thank
you.
-
Please,
will
you
help
my
parents?
I've
seen
you
looking
at
me.
If
you
were
to
rescue
them,
-
No!
And
what
does
it
mean,
We
will
send
for
everyone
-
And
if
there
are
hundreds,
Tuvia?
And
when
the
Germans
-
I
won't
let
that
happen.
-
No.
I
will
bring
them
out
myself.
-
Yes!
-
Go
back
to
work.
You're
wasting
time.
I
cannot
have
you
questioning
me
-
We're
family.
We
stick
together.
So
we
can
die
alongside
-
Don't
call
them
that.
They're
Jews.
Jews
who
stuck
up
their
noses
at
us.
Jews
who
would
lock
their
daughters
You
are
nothing
to
them,
Tuvia.
They
only
follow
you
because
they're
And
what
about
Bella?
She'd
be
with
you
-
Don't.
Tuvia...

Tuvia!
Lova,
Ben
Zion...
And
anyone
else
who'd
rather
fight
...we're
leaving
to
join
those
who
fight.
Are
you
coming?
No.
(announcement
over
loudspeaker


We
are
not
so
naive
to
think
but
all
the
Jews?
It
makes
no
sense.
They
need
us
to
work
in
the
factories,
They're
death
camps.
We,
too,
have
heard
of
such
places.
But
have
you
seen
them
yourself?
Can
you
tell
me
with
absolute
certainty
out
there
with
you
in
the
woods,
Do
you
think
we
haven't
all
considered
For
every
one
who
leaves,
they
kill
20.
How
can
I
sacrifice
thousands
What
if
we
take
you
all?
The
old?
The
sick?
How
will
we
live?
We
will
protect
you.
We
have
alliances
They're
as
bad
as
the
Germans!
Our
only
weapon
is
time.
If
I
can
buy
more,
we
will
have
won.
You
want
time?
Fine.
I'll
give
you
time.
A
day,
a
month,
maybe
even
a
year.
Your
daughter,
Chaya.
She
is
with
us.
Your
husband
is
waiting
for
you.
Rabbi...
Rabbi,
please.
We're
waiting
for
God.

I
am
going.

I
am
going.

I
am
going.
I
am
going.

Me,
too.
Wait.
Come
on.
Come.
Move
forward!
Come
along,
please!
Please
have
your
valuables
out
Come!
We're
not
going
to
bite
you.
Mama!
Papa!
-
Ah!
What
about
you,
Tateh?
Can
you
repair
guns?
-
The
trigger.
Come
forward.
Have
your
things
out
-
They
were
my
grandmother's.
Everyone
sacrifices
We
can
trade
this
How
about
carpenters?
-
Any
bootmakers?
Seamstresses?
-
Well,
that
should
come
in
handy!

You
have
a
new
profession.
-
Mazel
tov.
-
Next!
-
Good.
You
are
welcome.
-
I
am
a
nurse.
Friends!
to
see
you
here,
safely
amongst
us.
But
there
are
a
few
things
When
you
are
rested
and
settled,
Everyone
will
work.
We
will
help
supply
We
will
mend
clothes.
Women
will
learn
to
shoot,
Pregnancies
are
forbidden.
We
cannot
accommodate
Today...
we
will
start
rebuilding
This
is
the
one
place
in
all
We
welcome
you
into
our
community.
-
He
is
a
Jew?
Reload!

This
is
not
a
gun!
It
is
Samson's
jawbone.
It
is
the
slingshot
young
David
used
And
we
will
become
warriors...
...like
the
Maccabees
and
the
Sicarii,
brave
men
and
women
As
they
were.
Fire!
Good.
Boom!


Now,
this
here...
this
is
a
knight.
It
can
move
one,
two,
forward,
Yesterday
potato
with
beets,
Tomorrow,
special
treat.
Potato
soup.
Stop
complaining,
you
wenches,
-
We
love
potatoes,
don't
we,
boys?
We
like
latkes,
blintzes...
Thank
you!
Sit
down.
If
you
want
to
be
a
soldier,
you
drink!
What
are
you
doing?
-

So...
a
little
bird
told
me
that
a
certain
someone
is
waiting
to
ask
a
certain
question.
-
Hello,
Chaya.
-
Let
me
take
it.
-
Are
you
sure?
May
I
help
you?
Chaya,
I
was
wondering
if...
you...
I
mean,
you
and
I...
if...
we...
-
I
accept.
I
do.

Blessed
art
Thou,
our
God,
who
created
man
in
His
own
image...
...and
out
of
Himself
fashioned
for
us
Blessed
art
Thou,
our
God,
who
created
all
things
for
His
glory.
Oh,
gladden
these
loving
mates
as
Thou
did
anciently
gladden
Blessed
art
Thou,
O
God,
who
gladdens
the
bridegroom
-
Amen.

With
this
ring
according
to
the
law
of
Moses

Mazel
tov!







Tuvia,
this
is
it.
This
is
all
we
have.
Cover
them
up.
Some
talk
of
returning
to
the
ghetto.
We've
barely
eaten
for
days.

-
What
time
is
it?
-
Is
there
any
supper?
-
Tuvia
is
sending
out
more
missions.
I'd
rather
be
a
goat
than
a
snake.
We
should

joined
Zus.
Who's
stopping
you?

-

Out
of
the
way!
Out
of
the
way!
In
there.
More.
-
No,
that's
enough.
-
No!
-
Give
me!
-

No.
No,
that's
enough.


-
Hello.
You
get
used
to
it
eventually.
-
What
are
you
going
to
do
today?
-
I'll
tell
Asael
to
send
someone
else.
No,
I
want
to
go.
I
must
go.
Here.
You
must...
You
must
take
this.
Stay
warm.
Please.
Lilka!
Please
take
it.
Thank
you,
Tuvia.
Hm!
-
What?
"Property
of
the
commander."
Tuvia,
I'm
beginning
to
see
signs
Two
of
the
old
ones
have
died
this
week.
Tuvia!
-
Miriam!
-
He
says
it
was
a
patrol.
-
The
Germans
are
everywhere!
She
will
be
alright.
Take
your
food
back
now,
But
watch
out
for
patrols.
Good
luck.
-

Lazar,
I'm
coming
from
camp.
-
The
danger's
out
there.
-
Any
sign
of
the
food
mission?


-
Go!


I
think
it's
typhus.
The
lice
are
carriers.
but
they
say
they
need
it
-
Tuvia!
-
What
happened?
Are
you
alright?

-
You
are
too
sick.
Stay
in
the
truck.
Make
sure
-
No.
I'm
coming
with
you.
You
don't
have
to
do
this.
-
I
don't?
What
about
the
typhus?

Zus!
For
luck.
Take
it.


-
Tuvia!
Go!
Drive
the
fucking
truck!

-
The
others?
Fighters
die
so
that
malbushim
What
do
you
believe?
Communist,
Zionist,
Fascist...
What
difference
does
it
make,
Come
back
to
us.
You're
my
brother!
So,
you
remember.

Merciful
God,
we
commit
our
friends
Ben
Zion
We
have
no
more
prayers,
We
have
run
out
of
blood.
We
have
paid
for
each
of
We
have
covered
every
stone
Sanctify
another
land.

Teach
them
the
deeds
Grant
us
but
one
more
blessing.
Take
back
the
gift
of
our
holiness.
-
Amen.



Chaya,
this
amount
is
shit.
-
Get
off
me.
Arkady!
Get
your
hands
off
her!
-
Pisher!
Who
do
you
think
you
are?
Go
away,
little
man.
-
I'll
take
the
skin
off
your
face!
Get
back!
Put
that
away.
Put
it
away!

Now
what
is
happening
here?
Those
who
risk
their
lives
deserve
a
larger
portion
-

Everybody
gets
the
same.
-
She
is
my
wife!
Anybody
caught
stealing
-
What
consequences?
-
What?
This
matter
is
settled.
Get
back
in
line!

-

-
I
would
never...
Why
am
I
to
be
punished?
On
food
missions,
and
only
bring
back
what's
left
over.
that
you
are
power-hungry
and
corrupt.
That
you
take
-
That
we
keep
the
gold
for
ourselves.
That
you
are
no
longer
fit
to
lead
us.
Maybe
they're
right.
Zus
would
have
punched
him
Yes,
I
know.
-
Well,
I
miss
him.


Lova,
what
happened?
Who
did
this
to
you?
Gramov.
Two
others.
I
used
the
officers'
latrine.
They
say
they
won't
shit






Hey,
Arkady!
When
will
we
eat?
Lazar,
you
will
eat
with
the
rest


-

Tuvia?
-
You
must
come.
-
The
village
idiot.
Lazar...
I
saw
him
trying
to
impress
and
he
slipped
over,

Ah,
Chaya.
You
look
lovely
today.
Thank
you.
That
looks
delicious.
What
happened?
Arkady?
Arkady!
-
What
is
this?
Fighters
get
better
food.
That
is
against
my
orders.
You
are
no
longer
commander.

As
long
as
I
am
leader
of
this
group,
There
will
be
no
complaining,
no
doing
nothing.
Anyone
who
wants
to
leave,
leave
now!
Take
his
body
into
the
woods.
Do
it
now.

Your
fever
broke
in
the
night.
The
medicine
helped.
-
How
long
was
I
asleep?
You
nursed
me?
-
I
should
get
up.
-
I...
-
Did
you
study
nursing?
What
did
you
do
before
the
war?
Well,
my
wife...
I
mean,
before
the
Race
Laws.
-
And
she
has
passed?
I'm
sorry.
What
did
you
study
at
university?
-
Music.
You
should
rest.
Come.
-
Thank
you,
Lilka.
Who's
got
the
soap?
Use
the
sand,
Chaya.
And
look
at
that
skin!

Oh,
look
at
me!
When
we
get
out
of
this
forest,
I'm
going
to
eat
only
cake
-

Join
us!
At
least
the
sun
is
warm.
-
I
can't,
Lilka.
-
I
am
pregnant.
I've
been
hiding
it
for
months,
-
It
could
come
any
day.
It
happened
when
I...
It
was
a...
...a
man
with
a
gun.
He
stopped
me.
What
will
happen
when
Tuvia
finds
out?
-
He
will
understand.
I
won't.
I
won't
tell
him.
I
feel
there's
new
life
inside
me.
It's
the
only
thing
keeping
me
going.
And
I
won't
give
it
up.
No.
Lazar
says
he
spotted
another
patrol.

You
hear
that?
Here.
-
She
promises
not
to
take
extra.
So
you're
going
to
shoot
her,
too?
Please,
Tuvia.
-
I
cannot
allow
it.
I
cannot
keep
the
living
alive!

Tamara
and
the
man
who
fathered
-
They
must
leave.
You
tell
us
to
hold
on
to
our
humanity,
not
to
become
like
animals.
What
better
way
than
by
bringing
a
life
It
is
our
only
hope.
Alright.
Thank
you,
Tuvia!
I
know
what
is
expected
of
the
women
-
Lilka...
I'm
not
even
afraid
of
you.
You
call
that
a
move?
I
call
it
an
inevitable
conclusion
The
question,
my
friend
the
genius,
I'm
thinking
about
what
I'll
do.

I
got
him!
Tuvia!
We
found
this
one
and
two
We
killed
two.
Aron
was
hurt,
-
We
found
this.
Look
what
we
have
here!

Filthy
German
dog!
We
found
this
in
his
pouch.
Alright?
-
You
read
this.
You
were
you
looking
for
Jews,
huh?
What
are
you
going
to
do
now?

-

Animal!
Look
at
him!
He
doesn't
shut
up,
huh?

They've
assigned
a
division
-
Don't
they
have
a
war
to
fight?
Passover.
How
fitting!
Dreck!
Tuvia!
Tuvia!

-
He
says
he
has
a
wife
and
children.
If
you
let
him
go,
Ask
if
he'll
promise

He
will
say
anything!
Stop
it!
He's
one
of
them!
No!

We
want
justice!

Justice!

My
son's
name
was
David!
He
had
blue
eyes!
He
was
only
15!

My
brother's
name
was
Hanz!

I
don't
know
It
doesn't
matter.
If
I
had
stayed
in
the
ghetto,
You
saved
my
life.
No.
You
saved
mine.
Zus!
-
Zus?
What
are
we
doing?
-
What
for?
Where
will
we
go?

But
the
children
of
Israel...

The
children
of
Israel
until
Moses
said,
"Do
not
trust
in
me."
"Trust
in
God.
And
that
is
why,
tomorrow,
we
will
celebrate
the
Passover
by
sitting
around
and
arguing,
-
Did
he
see
us?
-
Tomorrow
is
Passover,
yes?
Moses.
The
Exodus.
He
left
You
want
to
move
them
all?
-
They'll
never
make
it.
Shimon,
this
is
it!
Back
to
your
zimlankas.
Come
on,
come
on!
-
Take
this.
-
How
will
they
keep
up?
-
Take
only
weapons!
Hurry!
-
Come
with
me!
-
Please!
Take
cover!
Take
cover!
Take
cover!
Move!
Now!
Move!
Move!
Come
on!
Stay
with
me!
Come
on!
Get
down!
Go!
Get
in!
Move!
-
Move!





Are
you
alright?
-
Are
you
alright?
I'm
alright!
My
ears!

-
Get
them
out
of
the
bunkers.
No!
It's
over.
They're
coming.
We
need
to
hold
them
up
-
Machine
guns!
Lazar,
Rosa
and
Schmuel,
-
No!
No!
Hurry!
Come!
-
Move!
We
have
to
hurry.
Take
all
these
people
with
you.
-
I
want
to
stay
with
you!
-
Rosa,
down
there!
Go
with
them.
It
is
not
safe
here.
Don't
try
and
fight
them.
Just
slow
them
Chaya,
please.
-
No.
-
No!
-
Take
her.
Move,
Chaya.
Go.

Quickly!
Let
me
help
you.
Come.


They're
moving
to
the
right.
Go.
Go!
-


-




Oh,
my
God!


We
have
to
keep
going!

Are
the
others
back
yet?
Asael?

Tuvia?
Do
we
stay
or
go?

We
have
to
wait
-
We
could
hide.
-
That's
crazy.
-
My
father
cannot
make
it.
-

The
children.
-

What
do
we
do?

The
others
are
dead.
Tuvia!
Tuvia!
-

What
are
we
going
to
do?
-
Come.
-
Yes.
Give
it
to
me!
You
use
this
on
yourself
-

Why
are
we
stopping?

Someone
take
him.
They're
coming!
They're
coming!
Why
aren't
we
moving?
-
Huh?
We
must
keep
going!
-
It
is
impossible.
What
we
all
have
done
is
impossible!
Tuvia!
The
troops
are
coming.
God
will
not
part
these
waters.
-
But
how?
We
will
do
it
together,
by
our
strength!
Give
me
the
rope
from
your
pack.
-
Quickly.
-
We
will
link
arms,
make
a
chain.

The
strong
will
take
care
Give
him
your
belt.
Give
him
your
belt.
-
Here,
take
these.
-

I
have
a
belt.

Ssh.
Quiet!





How
much
further?


Tuvia!
-
Keep
moving,
keep
moving.
You
can't
sleep
here.
It's
not
time
-
Come
on.

Asael!
Look!
We've
made
it!


Tuvia!

Tuvia.
-
I've
got
something
to
say.
-
Don't
talk.
Please.

I...
I
almost
lost
my
faith.
But
you
were
sent
by
God
to
save
us.
Ridiculous.

I
know!
But,
just
in
case...
...I
thank
Him,
and
I
thank
you.



Tank!
Take
cover!
-
Everybody,
down!
Down,
get
down!
-
Take
cover!
Take
cover!
Get
down!
Tuvia!
What
do
we
do?
-
Try
and
go
back
across
the
river?
Get
the
ammunition
to
the
guns!
Isaac!
Take
those!


Isaac!
Ammunition.
Ammunition!
There.

No!
No!

Come,
come.
Strip
the
bodies
of
weapons
-
Anything
else?
-
What
about
the
dead?
Everybody,
gather
your
belongings!
-
Shulman?
Everybody.
Tell
them
weapons
only.
-
Of
course.
Weapons
only!
You've
been
promoted.
Congratulations.

Weapons
only!
Let's
move,
please.
-
Where
is
the
rest
of
your
unit?
Are
you
going
back?
No.
Well,
we
have
a
new
camp
to
build.
Perhaps
you...
have
room
for
one
more.
Let's
go!
Come
on.

-
Do
you
see
that?
The
forest.
Beautiful,
isn't
it?
Yes,
it
is.
