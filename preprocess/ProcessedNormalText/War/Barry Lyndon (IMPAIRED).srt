Gentlemen,
NARRATOR:
Barry's
father
was
bred,

the
profession
of
the
law.
There

no

would've
made

...had
he
not
been
killed
in
a
duel...
...which
arose
over
the
purchase

NARRATOR:
Barry's
mother,
...lived
in
such
a
way
Many
a
man
who
had
been
charmed
...renewed
his
offers
to
the
widow.
But
she
refused
all
proposals
...declaring
that
she
lived
...and
the
memory
of
her
departed
saint.

NARRATOR:
First
love!
What
a
change
What
a
magnificent
secret
it
is
The
tender
passion
gushes
out
He
loves
as
a

sings...

If
you

it.
You

I

of
you

I
cannot
find
it.
You

properly.
I
cannot
find
it.
I'll
give
you
a

I
feel
the
ribbon.

Why

you
trembling?
At

Mr.
Brady,
I've

I'm

And
this

...should
be
horsewhipped!
Mr.
Quin
can
have
satisfaction

We're
taking
the
children
for
a
ride
BARRY:
Have
a
nice
time.
Goodbye,
little
Bryan.
BARRY:
Lord
Bullingdon.
Take
good
care
of
your
mother.
Come
now,
give
your
father
a
proper
kiss.
LADY
LYNDON:
Lord
Bullingdon...
...is
that
the
way
to
behave
Lord
Bullingdon,
My
father
was
Sir
Charles
Lyndon.
Lord
Bullingdon,
Madam,
you
have
insulted
my
father.
Dearest,
would
you
excuse
us?
BARRY:
Gentlemen.

BARRY:
One.
Two.

Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
BARRY:
Lord
Bullingdon...
...I
have
always
been
willing
But
be
clear
about
one
thing:
As
men
serve
me,
I
serve
them.
I
never
laid
a
cane
on
the
back
...but,
if
you
force
me
to,
I
shall
BARRY:
Do
you
have
anything
No.
You
may
go.
NARRATOR:
Barry
believed,
and
not
...a
declaration
of
war
against
him
...and
that
the
evil
consequences
...were
entirely
of
Bullingdon's
creating.
[Vibrant

music,
MAGICIAN:
I
shall
make
you
I
shall
show
you
the
knot
that
never
was.
NARRATOR:
As
Bullingdon
grew
up
...his
hatred
for
Barry
...equalled
only
by
his
MAGICIAN:
Very
good,
Bryan.
Put
it
on
the
table
for
me.
NARRATOR:
...the
local
nobility,
...came
to
pay
their
respects.
The
inside
and
outside
are
quite
empty.
Wave
your
hand
over
the
top.
Wonderful!
Wonderful,
colourful
Take
a
bow,
Bryan,

Very
good.
Let's
see
if
you
have
something
Yes,
you
have.
MAGICIAN:
A
little
ball.
It's
gone.
Here
it
is,
behind
my
elbow.
MAGICIAN:
Wave
your
hand
...and
see
if
we
can
produce
Here
it
comes.
The
colours
of
the
rainbow.
You
know
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
Nothing
in
my
magic
cabinet.
They
produce
the
colour...
white.
And
there
is
my
own...
...beautiful
white
rabbit.
MAGICIAN:
Bryan,
you
have
done

[Vibrant
classical
music,
We
crept
up
on
their
fort,
My
fellows
jumped
after
me.
You
should
have
seen
the
Frenchmen's
...sword
and
pistol,
cut
and
thrust,
In
three
minutes
we
left
...as
there
were
cannon
balls.
Later
we
were
visited
"Who
is
the
man
who
has
done
this?"
"How
many
heads
was
it
"Nineteen,"
says
I,
Well,
I'll
be
blessed,
BARRY:
"Noble,
noble
fellow,"
"Here
is
nineteen
golden
guineas,
What
do
you
think
of
that?
Were
you
allowed
to
keep
the
heads?
No,
they
always
become
Will
you
tell
me
another
story?
I'll
tell
you
one
tomorrow.
Will
you
play
cards
with
me
tomorrow?
Of
course
I
will.
Now
go
to
sleep.
Will
you
keep
the
candles
lit?
Bryan,
big
boys
don't
sleep
I'm
afraid
of
the
dark.
My
darling,
there's
nothing
But,
I
like
it
with
the
candles
lit.
All
right,
you
can
sleep
Thank
you,
Papa.
Good
night.

MRS.
BARRY:
Ah,
Redmond!
It's
a
blessing
to
see
my
darling
boy
And
for
which
I
pinched
myself
Little
Bryan
is
a
darling
boy...
...and
you
live
in
great
splendour.
Your
lady
wife
knows
...she
couldn't
have
had,
But,
if
she
should
tire
...and
his
old-fashioned
Irish
ways...
...or
if
she
should
die...
...what
future
would
there
be
MRS.
BARRY:
You
have
not
a
penny
...and
cannot
transact
any
business
Upon
her
death
the
entire
estate
...who
bears
you
little
affection.
You
could
be
penniless
tomorrow...
...and
darling
Bryan
at
the
mercy
Shall
I
tell
you
something?
There
is
only
one
way
for
you
You
must
obtain
a
title.
I
shall
not
rest
You
have
important
friends.
They
can
tell
you
For
money,
well-timed
...can
accomplish
anything.
NARRATOR:
And
Barry
was
acquainted
...who
knew
how
these
things
were
done.
This
was
the
distinguished
Barrister
...Lord
Hallam...
...whose
acquaintance
he
had
made,
Do
you
happen
to
know
BARRY:
I
don't
believe
I
do.
Well,
this
nobleman
is
one
...with
whom
our
revered
Monarch
In
my
opinion,
you
would
be
wise
...your
chief
reliance
for
the
advancement
When
I
take
up
a
person,
Mr.
Lyndon,
There
is
no
question
about
them
anymore.
My
friends
are
the
best
people.
...or,
indeed,
the
least
virtuous,
...or
the
stupidest,
But,
the
best.
In
a
word,
people
about
whom
I
cannot
promise
how
long
it
will
take.
You
can
appreciate
But,
any
gentleman
with
an
estate,
...should
have
a
peerage.
[Vibrant
classical
music,
And
there
standing
behind
me
I
looked
at
him,
and
he
said
to
me:
"Excuse
me,
sir,
could
you
tell
me,

I
was
so
astonished,
Then
I
became
angry,
NARRATOR:
The
striving
...was
one
of
Barry's
He
made
great
sacrifices
He
lavished
money
here,
He
bought
lands
...purchased
pictures
and
articles
He
gave
entertainments
...all,
being
about
the
Royal
person,
And,
I
can
tell
you,
bribes
were
So
near
the
person
of
His
Majesty
...what
great
noblemen
condescended
PONTEFRACT:
This
is
...a
disciple
of
Alessandro
Allori.
It's
dated
1605...
...and
shows,
It's
beautiful.
Yes.
I
love
the
use
of
the
colour
blue
Yes,
that
is
very
beautiful.
What
is
the
price
of
this
one?

Well,
this
is
one
of
my
best
pictures.
But,
if
you
really
like
it,
I'm
sure
[Vibrant
classical
music
continues,

Lord
Wendover,
Your
Majesty.
I'm
glad
to
see
you
here
today,
What
news
of
Lady
Wendover?
Thank
you,
Your
Majesty.
Good!
Present
my
compliments
to
her.
And
what
of
those
excellent
boys
They're
well.
Charles
has
gone
to
sea
John
has
gone
to
Oxford
to
learn
Good,
good!
Your
Majesty,
may
I
present
Mr.
Lyndon.
We
were
very
fond
And
how
is
Lady
Lyndon?
She's
very
well,
Your
Majesty.
Mr.
Lyndon
raised
a
company
of
troops
Good,
Mr.
Lyndon.
Raise
another
company

NARRATOR:
Barry
was
born
...but
incapable
of
keeping
one.
For
the
qualities
and
energies
...are
often
the
very
cause
of
his
ruin
Now
he
was
burdened
with
...which
are
the
dismal
adjuncts
And
his
life
now...
...seemed
to
consist
mostly
of
drafts
...and
endless
correspondence...
...with
decorators
and
cooks.

Gentlemen,
I'm
going
to
leave
you
for
Yes,
sir.
BRYAN:
Bully.
What
does...
..."strenuous"
mean?
Bryan,
I'm
trying
to
work.
But
what
does
it
mean?
It
means
"an
effort
requiring
strength."
What
does
"quadrangle"
mean?
A
quadrangle
is
a
four-sided
figure
Now,
please
be
quiet,

Bryan,
please
be
quiet!
Have
you
seen
my
pencil?
No,
I
haven't.

Bryan,
please
stop
making
so
much
noise.
That's
my
pencil.
No,
it
isn't.
It
is.
It's
my
pencil!
I've
had
this
all
morning.
It's
my
pencil!
Listen,
will
you
be
quiet!
It's
my
pencil!
I'll
teach
you
a
lesson.

BARRY:
What
the
devil's

BARRY:
I
told
you
never
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
BARRY:
Six.

Will
that
be
all,
Mr.
Redmond
Barry?
BARRY:
Yes,
that
will
be
all.
Well
then,
look
you
now.
From
this
moment,
I
will
submit
I
will
kill
you,
if
you
lay
hands
Is
that
clear
to
you,
sir?
Get
out
of
here!


Don't
you
think
he
fits
my
shoes
BULLINGDON:
Dear
child...
...what
a
pity
it
is
I'm
not
dead,
The
Lyndons
would
then
have
BULLINGDON:
...of
the
illustrious
blood
Would
they
not...
...Mr.
Redmond
Barry?
From
the
way
I
love
this
child...
...you
ought
to
know
how
...had
he
proved
worthy
BULLINGDON:
Madam!
I
have
borne
as
long
...the
ill-treatment
of
the
insolent
Irish
BULLINGDON:
It
is
not
only
his
...which
disgust
me.
But
the
shameful
nature
of
his
conduct
...his
brutal
and
ungentlemanlike
...his
open
infidelity...
...his
shameless
robberies
and
swindling
And
as
I
cannot
personally
chastise
...to
witness
his
treatment
of
you...
...and
loathe
his
company
...I
have
decided
to
leave
my
home
BULLINGDON:
At
least,
...or
during
my
own.

No,

Hello.
I

Oh,

NARRATOR:
Barry
had
his
faults...
...but
no
man
could
say
of
him
He
loved
his
son
with
a
blind
partiality.
He
denied
him
nothing.
It
is
impossible
to
convey
...and
how
he
indulged

to
his
future
success
But
fate
had
determined
that
he
should

he
should
finish

childless.

Will
you
buy
me

She's
only

I
want
a
real

Then
I

enough
for

Oh,
yes!

Though

Oh,

BULLINGDON:
If
my

would've
been
as
much

if
I

For
to
the
everlasting
disgrace
...I
have,
by
my
cowardice,

the
Barrys

ignorant
tyranny
over
our
lives...
...which
has
left
my
mother

to
squander
and
ruin

know
I
am
despised.
And
quite
justifiably
so.
However...
...I
know
now
what
I
must
do.
And
what
I
shall
do.
Whatever
be
the
cost.
RECEPTIONIST:
Good
morning,
My

Good

Yes,

Mr.
Redmond
Barry.
The
last
occasion
on
which
we
met...
...you
wantonly
caused
me
injury
In
such
a
manner,
and
to
such
an
extent
...without
demanding
satisfaction...
...however
much
time
intervenes.
I
have
now
come
to
claim
[Dramatic

Mr.
Lyndon...
...these
are
a
matched
pair
of
pistols,
...your
second
has
loaded
one,
As
they
belong
to
Lord
Bullingdon,
SIR
RICHARD:
Lord
Bullingdon.
[Dramatic

beat
Now,
gentlemen,
to
determine
...I
will
toss
a
coin
in
the
air.
As
the
offended
party,
it
is
Is
that
agreeable
to
both
of
you?
Yes.
If
Lord
Bullingdon
calls
correctly
If
incorrectly,
Mr.
Lyndon
Is
that
clearly
understood?
SIR
RICHARD:
What
is
your
call,
Heads.
SIR
RICHARD:
It
is
heads.
Lord
Bullingdon
will
have
the
first
fire.
Lord
Bullingdon...
...will
you
take
your
ground?
One...
two...
three...
...four...
five...
six...
...seven...
eight...
nine...
ten.
SIR
RICHARD:
Mr.
Lyndon,
SIR
RICHARD:
Are
you
ready
Yes.
Lord
Bullingdon...
...cock
your
pistol...
...and
prepare
to
fire.
[Dramatic
instrumental
beat
Sir
Richard,
this
pistol
must
be
faulty.
BULLINGDON:
I
must
have
another
one.
I'm
sorry,
Lord
Bullingdon,
...and
allow
Mr.
Lyndon
his
turn
to
fire.
SIR
RICHARD:
That
is
correct,
Your
pistol
has
fired,
SIR
RICHARD:
Mr.
Lyndon,
Yes.
Lord
Bullingdon...
...are
you
ready
to
receive

Yes.
SIR
RICHARD:
Very
well,
then.
Mr.
Lyndon...
...cock
your
pistol...
...and
prepare
to
fire.


Are
you
ready,
Lord
Bullingdon?
SIR
RICHARD:
Is
your
pistol
cocked,
Yes.
Then
prepare
to
fire.
One...
...two...

Lord
Bullingdon,
in
view
of
Mr.
Lyndon
...do
you
now
consider
[Dramatic

beat
I
have
not
received
satisfaction.
SIR
RICHARD:
Mr.
Lyndon,

Yes.
SIR
RICHARD:
Lord
Bullingdon...
...cock
your
pistol
One...
...two...


NARRATOR:
Barry
was
carried
to

I'm
nearly
finished.

I'm
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
this,
I'm
afraid
you'll
have
to
lose
the
leg...
...most
likely
below
the
knee.
Lose
the
leg?
What
for?
The
simple
answer
is
to
save
your
life.
The
ball
has
shattered
the
bone
Unless
I
amputate,
there's
no
way
...and
stop
the
hemorrhage.

Yes,
My
Lord?
When
we
arrive
at
Castle
Hackton,
Don't
go
into
any
unnecessary
detail.
Just
tell
her
where
he
is
She
will
want
to
go
to
him.
See
that
she
is
out
of
the
house
and
And
in
no
event...
...is
she
to
be
allowed
to
see
my
mother...
...or
create
any
disturbance
at
the
house
GRAHAM:
Yes,

Mrs.
Barry,
how
do
you
do?
MRS.
BARRY:
How
nice
Thank
you.
You...
received
my
note?
Yes,
we
were
expecting
you.
Oh,
good,
I
didn't
want
Mr.
Lyndon,
how
are
you
feeling?
I'm
feeling
much
better,
Won't
you
sit
down?
Thank
you,
Mrs.
Barry.
Would
you
like
some
tea?
Oh,
no!
No,
thank
you,
Mrs.
Barry.
How's
the
world
treating
you,
Graham?
GRAHAM:
Oh,
not
too
bad.
GRAHAM:
Are
you
comfortable
here?
Most
comfortable.
Good,
good!
Shall
we
get
down
to
the
matter
at
hand?
By
all
means.
GRAHAM:
Mr.
Lyndon...
...Lord
Bullingdon
has
instructed
me...
...to
offer
you
an
annuity...
...of
500
guineas
a
year
for
life.
Specifically
on
the
condition
of
your...
...leaving
England...
...and
to
be
stopped...
...the
instant
of
your
return.
Lord
Bullingdon
has
also
asked
me
...that
should
you
decide
to
remain
here...
...your
stay
would
infallibly
plunge
you...
...into
jail.
As
in
view
of
the
present
circumstances
...innumerable
writs
taken
out
...debts
long-outstanding...
...and
your
credit
is
so
blown
that...
...you
could
not
hope...
...to
raise
a
shilling.
[Somber

NARRATOR:
Utterly
baffled
...what
was
the
lonely
He
took
the
annuity
and
returned
...to
complete
his
recovery.
Sometime
later
he
travelled
abroad.
His
life
there,
we
have
not
the
means
He
appears
to
have
resumed
...without
his
former
success.
He
never
saw
Lady
Lyndon
again.
