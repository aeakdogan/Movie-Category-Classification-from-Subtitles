He
said,
that
the
day
he
climbed
from
he
was
already
dead
All
my
men
are
dead
I
am
the
only
one
left
That
is
because
you
have
a
good
life
I
pretended
to
be
dead
My
men,
over
1600
strong
Fought
for
3
days
and
nights
All
gone
The
Kui
Army
bastards
just
stood
the
rear
and
watched.
Watching
my
men
die
one
by
one
All
dead
...
He
said,
he
met
a
woman
that
day
and
spent
a
night
in
an
abandoned
run-down
house
He
wasn't
sure
if
it
was
the
bowl
of
gruel,
or
the
woman
that
made
him
feel
that
he
was
still
alive
Where
can
I
get
some
rice
to
eat?
Go
wait
in
front
of
the
old
house
on
the
main
street
He
said
That
on
the
first
day
he
met
me
The
sky
was
ashen,
just
like
his
mood
But
I
remember
vividly,
that
it
was
a
clear
day
Glaring
to
the
eye
After
you've
eaten,
come
and
work
to
repay
your
lives
After
you've
eaten,
come
and
work
Food!
Come,
eat!
You
fight
well
...
follow
me!
I'll
bring
you
to
see
big
brother!
What
work
is
it?
Robbery!
He
later
said,
that
we
were
foolishly
brave
to
dare
to
steal
from
troops
I
replied,
that
there
was
no
food
within
a
100
mile
radius
When
you're
about
to
die
from
starvation,
Charge
out!
Kill!
Quick!
Kill
the
leader!
That
day,
not
only
did
he
save
me
He
also
taught
me

When
beating
a
snake,
you
must
beat
it
7
inches,
Brother
WuYang
Look
It
was
from
'that'
person
That's
what
Generals
wear
Brother
WuYang
is
a
General
Brother
WuYang
is
a
General
What
are
you
thinking
about?
My
home
They're
back
...
Don't
be
impatient,
come,
we
have
food!
Tonight
we're
going
to
have
a
feast!
Why
are
you
alone?
I
ran
away
from
home
By
your
accent,
you
are
from
YangZhou?
You
picked
up
on
it?
How
did
you
pick
that
I
had
a
YangZhou
accent?
Have
you
heard
of
the
YangZhou
market?
Thats
where
they
pick
out
the
prettiest
girls,
And
after
they've
grown
up,
But
...
When
I
was
15
and
about
to
be
sold
A
childhood
friend
stole
me
back
He
even
killed
someone
and
took
me
to
hide
He
didn't
realize
that
you'd
changed,
He
is
a
good
person
Rest
in
peace!
Rest
in
peace!
Big
Brother's
rules
Leave
an
empty
place
at
the
table
Were
you
a
commander
in
the
army?
It's
in
the
past
now
Why
did
you
leave?
Come,
drink!
We
were
Imperial
troops,
The
Kui
Army
promised
but
did
not
deliver
And
we
could
not
suppress
the
enemy
So
all
of
my
men
died
The
world
is
big,
but
not
bigger
Right?
Without
comrades
Life
is
not
worth
living
WuYang
Time
to
eat
Will
the
new
people
in
the
village,
stay?
With
rice
to
eat,
who
will
leave?
Yes,
there's
one
named
Pang,
Whether
he
will
leave,
I
do
not
know
Doesn't
it
look
nice?
I
got
it
from
a
body
Do
you
know
what
this
is?
No
idea
A
protection
charm
Was
that
night
real?
I
stayed
there
waiting
I
thought
it
was
but
a
dream
If
you'd
already
run
away,
why
did
you
come
back?
I've
run
away
many
times
It
seems
a
good
idea,
but
each
time
I
come
back
Why
do
you
come
back?
One's
fate
should
be
decided
by
oneself
Hide
here
...
why
are
you
taking
our
food
You
want
to
hit
me
with
your
rod?
-Hit
me!
Hit
me!
Stop!
How
old
are
you?

You'd
hit
a
grandmother?
Don't
move,
I'll
shoot!

People
will
die!
I'm
not
afraid
of
you
I'm
serious,
I'll
shoot.

I'm
serious
...
I'm
not
afraid!

You
kill
me!
You
Nobody
move
Why
aren't
you
looking
at
me?
Did
you
think
that
by
raiding
our
supply
cart,
I'm
giving
you
a
chance
today

report
yourselves
to
the
imperial
government
Leave!
If
we
only
had
guns,
we'd
fight
them
It'd
still
be
suicide
Living
like
this,
I'd
rather
die
Being
a
bandit
is
a
dog's
life;
always
on
the
run
Why
don't
we
join
the
army?
In
the
army,
we'd
get
paid
With
the
money
we
can
buy
food
for
our
families
In
the
army
we'd
have
weapons.
The
village
would
have
true
peace
We
are
bandits
Would
the
government
accept
us?
The
Kui
Army
is
a
big
military
power
They
won't
even
bother
with
our
little
band
But
ChenGong
needs
manpower
His
Lu
Army
is
constantly
being
harassed
by
the
Kui
Army
And
he
wants
to
be
a
major
military
power
If
we
side
with
him,
it
would
be
perfect
timing
ErHu,
grasp
this
opportunity
And
let
today's
events,
never
happen
again
Fine
Bandits
We
have
to
be
the
best!
In
the
past
you
were
a
Qing
soldier
You
have
no
loyalty
Why
should
we
trust
you?
Swear
a
blood
oath
Today,
Pang
ChingYun
Cao
ErHu
Jiang
WuYang
Swear
an
oath,
to
be
blood
brothers

In
each
other
we
entrust,
to
save
from
danger

Together
in
prosperity
or
difficulty

If
an
outsider
disrupts
our
brotherhood

By
our
oath,
they
must
die

If
a
brother
disrupts
our
brotherhood

By
our
oath,
they
must
die

With
the
heaven
and
earth
as
our
witness


Together
in
one
heart
He
later
told
me,
He
didn't
believe
in
blood
oaths
I
asked
what
he
did
believe
in
He
said
that
he
believed
in
Brother
ErHu
and
me
Wait,
take
these
shoes
Be
careful
on
the
road
Mother
won't
be
able
to
see
you
again
Mum,
I'm
leaving
Brother
ErHu
Shi
JiMiao
has
taken
a
group
of
men
He
only
said
one
thing
That
he'd
rather
die
than
join
the
army
I
heard
You
led
a
battalion
of
men
to
suppress
the
enemy
in
HeChuan
But
they
all
perished
You
disappeared
for
2
months,
and
you
have
the
audacity
to
return?
Lord
Chen
At
the
battle
of
HeChuan
Lord
Jiang
sent
the
Kui
Army
to
guard
my
left
wing
He
Kui,
fearing
the
enemy,
retreated
30
Li
This
is
how
my
battalion
of
men
all
died
The
whole
army
perished
And
you
were
the
only
survivor?
I
didn't
die
So
that
I
could
come
back
to
see
you,
Lord
Jiang
How
many
men
do
you
have?
Eight
Hundred
Give
me
another
800
And
within
15
days,
I
will
take
SongCheng
A
soldier
should
not
tell
lies
10
days
I
will
take
SongCheng
in
10
days
Fine
I
...
I
will
give
you
another
1500
soldiers
But
there
will
be
no
pay
That's
not
necessary
After
I
take
the
city,
I
want
half
of
everything
Pang
ChingYun
Your
banner
is

Well
call
them
the
Mountain
Army
then
Thank
you,
my
lords
You're
taking
a
gamble
With
the
lives
of
800
men
War
has
always
been
a
gamble
I
won't
gamble
These
1500
soldiers
are
ChenGong's
foundation
If
they
go
ChenGong
will
lose
all
power
in
the
Imperial
court
So
when
will
you
make
your
move?
My
soldiers
Will
only
serve
to
make
your
force
look
more
threatening
This
is
your
only
chance
for
victory
Otherwise
The
Kui
Army
will
forever
have
you
under
their
feet
Big
Brother
They're
all
faulty
Over
there
are
200
guns
It
will
be
a
difficult
battle
There
is
only
one
way
to
win
A
blind
charge,
to
destroy
their
artillery
A
battle
of
ruthlessness
Comrades
Tell
him,
who
is
the
fiercest?
We're
the
fiercest!
Our
armies
are
separated
by
300
paces
Their
guns
have
a
range
of
200
paces
Arrows
have
a
range
of
100
paces
We
need
200
men
in
the
frontline
to
charge
Followed
by
200
archers
When
they
fire,
don't
stop.

Continue
the
charge
Follow
it
through
to
the
end
To
let
the
archers
gain
that
100
paces
Many
men
will
die
I'll
go!
Who
will
go
with
me?
The
families
for
those
who
go
will
be
paid
extra
Those
who
die,
2
pieces,
those
who
live
3
pieces!
Go
make
your
fortunes

Come
Damn
it,
I'll
go!
Me
too!
Include
me,
I'll
go
...
Me
too
...
I'll
go
...
Me
too
...
Defeat
SongCheng!
Seize
gold,
seize
food,
seize
land!
Defeat
SongCheng!
Seize
gold,
seize
food,
seize
land!
,
the
victor
has
already
been
decided
We
are
merciful,
surrender
and
we
will
spare
your
lives
Kill!
Fire!
Kill!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Kill!
They're
almost
all
dead,
why
aren't
we
going
yet?
Don't
you
ever
forget
On
the
battlefield,
there
can
only
be
one
commander
Kill!
Release
the
arrows!
Release!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Ready!
Blindfold
the
horses
Charge!
Save
Big
Brother!
Big
Brother!
Don't
pull
it
out!
Hold
steady
We're
really
going
to
die
here!
We
made
a
blood
oath
We
pray
not
to
be
born
together,
but
to
die
together!
Well
said
Even
in
death
we
need
to
take
something
with
us
Everyone
we
kill
counts!
Charge
out!
Kill!
Insane!
Those
800
men
have
thrown
5000
soldiers
into
chaos
We
can
fight!
We
desperately
need
this
victory!
On
me!
Charge!
WuYang!
Lord
Li
Pang
ChingYun
can
be
considered
a
blessing
Pang
ChingYun,
it
seems
we
have
a
destiny
together
Seems
you've
found
yourself
a
treasure
there
With
the
SongCheng
battle,
you've
made
name
for
yourself
Pang
ChingYun
I'll
put
another
5
battalions
under
your
command.

It's
like
adding
flowers
to
a
bouquet
-Lun
DaShan
From
now
you
are
responsible
for
transferring
funds
Thank
you,
Sir
Pang
ChingYun
There's
an
old
friend
from
the
Kui
Army
waiting
for
you
He
Kui
Present
My
Lord
General
Pang
Long
time
no
see
As
you
already
know
each
other,
You
conquer
the
cities,
and
he'll
defend
them
With
him
here,
how'll
we
split
it?
Lord
Li
Lord
Chen
I
trust
you're
agreeable
with
this?
I'm
scared
that
he'll
be
too
slow
to
keep
up
First
we'll
take
SuZhou,
then
Nanjing
How
about
it?
What
are
they
laughing
at?
Nanjing
is
the
enemies
heart
To
break
Nanjing,
you
must
take
SuZhou
first
If
the
war
ends,
they
have
nothing
to
gain
They
won't
let
us
fight
SuZhou
Can
they
do
anything
if
we
do
go
and
fight?
Inserting
the
Kui
Army
was
so
that
they
could
keep
an
eye
on
us
Come
quick,
they're
back!
XiaoWu
XiaoWu
....
XiaoWu's
shoes
....
XiaoWu
...
XiaoQi
XiaoQi,
my
son!
We
were
no
longer
bandits
He
said,
that
bandits
only
kill
for
their
own
But
we,
were
risking
ourselves
for
others
I'm
willing
to
be
this
kind
of
person
You've
lost
weight
Big
Brother
said,
that
this
time
we'll
be
back
in
3
years
I
know
that
you
don't
like
it
here
Once
I'm
done
fighting,
I'll
take
you
somewhere
nice
to
spend
our
days
Where's
Big
Brother?
He's
just
outside
the
village
He
said
that
he
won't
come
in
We
set
out
early
tomorrow
morning
Remember
All's
fair
in
war
Begin!
Kill!
We're
here
to
take
over
defense
of
the
city
And
let
our
comrades
indulge
themselves
for
3
days
Seize
money,
seize
food,
seize
land!
Come
out,
the
battle
is
over
Come
out
Come
on
out
Don't
be
afraid
You
haven't
eaten,
right?
Are
you
hungry?
What
are
you
doing?

Miss!
Are
you
going
to
watch?
GouZi,
I'm
leaving
Brother
Pang
Move!
What
is
it?
Why
are
you
holding
me?
Move!
What
is
it?
Harming
the
innocent,
will
be
punished
on
the
spot!
Brother
ErHu!
Big
Brother,
what
happened?
Rape
of
a
girl
Looting
the
city
for
3
days,
these
are
the
rules
From
today,
this
sort
of
thing
cannot
occur
in
our
ranks
We've
always
done
this
We
were
bandits,
now
we're
soldiers
If
we
don't
change,
we
won't
accomplish
anything
If
we
continue
to
do
this
We'll
be
just
like
those
Kui
Army
bastards
Rules
must
start
somewhere.

That
day
is
now
We've
just
finished
killing
their
family
members
Now
that
we're
here
You
want
protect
them?
Who
will
fight
for
you
in
the
future?
Big
Brother
Listen
to
me
Look
at
them
They
get
it
You
don't
need
to
kill
them,
right?
What
are
you
doing?
Hurry
up
an
admit
your
mistake!
Big
Brother,
we
were
wrong.

We
won't
do
it
again!
