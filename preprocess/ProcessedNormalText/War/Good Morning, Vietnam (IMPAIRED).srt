think
the
teacher
would
be
able
to
date
her?
-
Possibly,
but
you
would
need...
-
Specific
introductions.
SLOAN:
What
we're
gonna
Shopping
for
dinner
I
n
your
shopping
trip.
Specifically...
Excuse
me.
Can
I
help
you?
Yes,
I
have
two
months
to
live
I
don't
think
you
understand
me,
It's
all
yours,
you
got
it.
Hello,
class.
And
I'd
like
to
get
to
know
all
of
you
by
having
you
write
down
your
name,
address,
your
home
and
work
phone
on
paper,
Sergeant
Sloan
our
teacher.
I
was
sent
here
First
thing
I'd
like
to
know
is
-
Is
it
English?
And
how
lucky
for
me.
Now,
let's
start
off
with
the
fact
Let's
try
a
little
phrase,
uh,
I
like
to
call:
"My
boyfriend's
back
Hey,
nah,
hey,
nah,
my
boyfriend's
back."
Can
we
try,
"My
boyfriend's
back"?
She's
not
for
you.
Why
do
I
feel
like
the
miracle
worker
up
here?
[MUTTERS
INDISTINCTLY
GARLICK:
This
is
a
nightmare.
Even
saying
that
means
I
don't
know
dick.
I
can't
really
teach
English.
Didn't
have
to
pick
up
the
phones
I
can
only
tell
you
about
how
you
can
talk
If
you're
walking
on
the
streets

I
would
like
to
buy
some
cheese

Basically,
we
talk,
"Hey,
man,
what's
happening?
You
look
hip
today.
Slip
me
some
skin."
If
someone
in
America
comes
up
and
says,
"Slip
me
some
skin,"
don't
be
afraid.
They're
not
a
leper,
they're
not
gonna
go:
No,
it
means
like,
It's
a
greeting.
It's
like,
Here's
how
you
do
it,
"Slip
me
some
skin."
Then
you
go.
"Yeah,
there's
some
skin."
Yeah,
now,
then
you
say,
Say
that.
MAN:
Groovy.

Baby.
If
something's
really
nice,
you
say
it's
groovy.
Doesn't
mean
you're
like
going:
No,
it
means
groovy.
Try
that
one.
Say,
"Hey,
baby,
what's
happening?
Hey,
baby,
what's
happening?

-
See
you
later.
-
Well,
I'm
liking
you
too.
-
You
teach
American
thing
okay.
WILKIE:
Okay,
yeah,
well,
we'll
try
and
do
that
-
You
forget
the
girl.
She's
say
no.
That's
what
walking
away
I'm
interested
in
the
girl,
I
know
because
she's
my
sister.
I
would,
however,
love
to
buy
you
lunch,
-
Come
on.
Why
not?
I
got
a
great
personality,
You
phoney,
like
American
and
French
before
you.
Here
to
get
something,
You
come
into
my
class,
so
maybe
we
like
you.
You
come
for
the
girl,
you
get
her,
you
go.
Okay,
Sherlock,
yeah,
You
got
me,
bang.
But,
hey,
Let's
be
friends,
okay?
Come
on.
-
Come
on,
come
on.
No,
I
like
you
because
you're
honest.
We
look
like
a
before
and
after
picture.
Sometimes
your
face
That's
true,
it's
very
true.
TUAN:
You
can
buy
me
lunch,
I
know
Americans.
You
see
a
girl
with
the
type
breasts
and
they
buy
her
some
expensive
food,
And
then
try
and
take
her
into
a
bed.
CRONAUER:
So,
what's
wrong
with
that?
CRONAUER:
Any

I

I

You

Whoo-whoo-whoo.
She

the
Three
Stooges.
Oh,

like

you're
silly.

You

enough
for
this
place?
Hi,
Earl,
good
to
see
you
again.
-
Look
at
the
new
friend.
I
want
to
show
you
something
very
nice.
-
Oh,

-
I
can
confide
you?
Look
at
the
shape
of
that
soldier
ankle,
Help
me
get
some
photo
of
those
ankle,
You're
a
very
sick
man.
Thank
you.
Oh,

Pull

Terrible,

I've...
I'll

them.
I've
wanted
girls
like

Who

hell
gets
laid

a
young
child?
Cowgirls

gals.
Those

Don't

it
by
conjuring
up
images
Can
you
believe
the
shape
Shape

No,

meet
them,
but

have
to
kick
out
the
Chinks,
and
all
that's
gonna
be
left
in
here
and
what
fun
would
that
be?
Now
is
when
I
stop
talking.
Come

Are

Shut

Everybody
say
"gook,"
but
it's
all
right.

Jump

any
time,

I
gotta
tell
you
something,

Talk.
These

were
physically
abusing

I
thought
since
we
were
here
to...
Turn
the
place
upside
down.
Do
you
have
any
idea
to
have
a
man
under
my
command
-
You're
not
gonna
last
long
here,
pal.
Oh,
you
think
this
is
a
joke?
I
can
come
up
with
alternatives
I'm
real
good
at
stuff
like
that.
I
got
people
stuck
in
places
they
haven't
You
don't
think
I
can
come
up
Can
you
envision
Not

slides.
A
bar
brawl,
that's
one,
Cronauer.
You
better
stay
cool.
You

not
even
come

a
Puerto
Rican
waitress.
She
comes
over,
brings
you
a
red
soup.
Oh,
she
slips,
she
spills
it
that
you
paid
more
than
a
coloured
TV
for.
You're
a
little
angry,
so
you
say
to
her...
Uh,
look
what
you
did.
And
goddamn
it
and
stupid
and
crap.
That's
stupid,
you
don't
call
someone
crap.
No,
you
step
on
crap.
-
You
can
step
on
crap.
I
know
you
can.
No,
no,
you
see,
you
step
in
shit,
I'm
pretty
sure
you
can
step
on
crap.
How
can
some
person
look
like
a
shit?
-
It
impossible.
We
can
stop
with
the
debate
Let's
try
a
very
special
situation.
You
go
into
a
restaurant,
okay?
You're
wearing
your
best
new
suit.
She
comes
up,
she
spills
soup
"I'm
sorry.
What're
you
gonna
do
What
do
you
say
to
her?
They
spilled
something
on
your
pants,
I
do
nothing.
Come
on,
Wilkie,
it's
cursing
class.
You're
getting
pissed
off.
I
just
remain
reticent.
Okay,
she
goes
in
the
kitchen,
She's
stabbing
you.
She's
got
spoons
in
your
eyes,
Will.
They're
starting
to
cut
you
with
knives,
What
would
you
do,
Will?
I'm
waiting
to
die.
Mr.
Cronauer,
we
like
your
lessons
better
-
Soon
we
play
baseball?
We
have
to
have
training.
-
Where
are
you
come
from?
-
What
are
queens?
No?
Big
men
with
moustaches

Yeah.

What
is
a
lakai?
Relax
already,
crazy
American.
I
made
a
date
with
you
and
Trinh
tomorrow.
-
You
did?
By
the
food
and
flower
vendors
where
-
Where's
that?
-
When
you
burn
your
mouth.
But
I
warn
you,
You
say
it
ridiculous.
Why?
That's
the
most
ridiculous
thing
Hi.
Oh,
God,
this
could
be
very
ugly.
Hi.
Chaperons.
I
n
Vietnam,
family
often
come
Hello,
hey.
Oh,
God,
help
me.
This
is
wonderful.
Well,
you
know,
you're
very
beautiful.
And
you're
also
very
quiet.
And
I'm
not
used
to
girls
being
that
quiet
I
go
out
with
girls
who
talk
so
much
and
they
could
power
a
small
New
Hampshire
town.
You
talk,
I
think,
very
much.
Well,
you
see,
I'm
not
used
to
going
and
it
makes
me
a
little
nervous.
I
don't
want
makes
you
nervous,
Cronauer.
I
know
you
very
nice.
And
for
trusting,
you
is
the
best
of
never
to
be
for
both
the
same
and
another.
Well,
I
had
you
there,
babe,
Hey,
hey.
Hey,
Uncle
Phil.
Here
you
go,
there
you
go.
Hey,
there
we
go,
for
you.
Knock
yourselves
out.
What's

of
a
dollar
No
problem.
They're
having
a
great...
Hey,
listen,
I
know
there's
no
way.
But
it
doesn't
mean
we
can't
have
a
few
laughs.
Hey,
I'll
take
whatever
you
can
give
You
want
to
see
a
movie
or
something?
-
We
must
to
ask
the
people.
Attention,
shoppers.
CRONAUER:
"Under

You

You

Puff,
the
Magic

That's
wonderful.
Hey,
12,
please.
Um...




My
thoughts
exactly.
Why
can't
I
read
this?
They'd
never
approve
of
that
being
released.
That's
censorship,
Edward.
We're
not
in
America,
sir.
Can
we
please
not
get
into
this
right
now?
You
could
put

Here's
something
exciting:

Capitol
Hill."

I'm
reading
this.
Edward,
don't
you
ever
do
anything
Not
when
I
get
into
trouble.
No,
I
don't.
Eddie,
sometimes
you
got

seconds
of

there's
an

here.
I
think
he
sounds
exactly

I
tell
you
this.

An

Again,
we've
got
our

you
tell
us
what
you've
found
out

We
found
out

we're
having

we
ask

Just

you

You
don't

You'll
stay

No,

I
don't

NIXON:
CRONAUER:
Thank
you
for
that
but
I'd
like
to
delve
for
the

in
the

How
would
you
describe
your

NIXON:
-
and
they
have
no

CRONAUER:
What,
sir?
NIXON:
CRONAUER:
How
would

There
is

I
said

GARLICK:
-
Where
is
Cronauer?
I
want
to
see
him
ASAP.
What,

As
soon

possible.

yes.
Yes,

No,
she
don't.
She

I
can't,
I
gotta

it's
not
funny,
sir.
Sir,
I'm
begging
you.
Don't
try
to
do
comedy.
I'll
do
fine.
Comedy
is
what
you
make

I've
got
pages
and
pages
of
great
material.
Right,
Abersold?
I'm
afraid
you're
gonna
be
hitting

sir.
If
it
isn't
funny,
then
why
did
I
hear
I
was
thinking
of
something
else.
Thank
you
for
your
support.

Sir,
you're
not
funny.
Ask
around.
Sir,
with

You
might
lay
an

I
know

But,
hey,

Sir,
these

are
unequivocal.
E.g.,
"Hey,

That's
pretty

Where
you
going

You
gotta
be
careful,
Jack.
That's
like
Newark
after
dark.
That's
some
heavy

going
down,

You'll
feel
like

Yeah.

I
like
James
Brown.


Do
you
think
Really,
and
that
hair.

Gentlemen,
I
don't
know...
My
God,
they're
moving.
Look
out,
I'm
singing,
everybody.

-
Where
are
you
from?
Cleveland?
Vietnam's
not
that
much
Aw,
no.
Ha-ha-ha.
You
guys
take
care
of
yourself
"I
don't
know
what's
gonna
happen,
man.
-
What's
this
thing
on
your
helmet?
Well,
"Why
don't
you
try
it
out."
It
says...
What
sizes
you
got?
Look
at
this
thing.
Oh,
no,
Bozo,
boys
and

Look
at
this
thing.
Hold
on,
how
big
is
this
thing?
Black
man's
going,
"It's
just
for
the
tip.
It's
a
bathing
cap.
Remember,
Look,

There.
There's
prophylactic
everywhere,
man.
It's
not
a
pretty
picture.
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
You
guys,
be
careful.
-
My
name
is
Lewis

-
Thank
you.
-
Donum.
Feels
like
the
Mouseketeers
show.
Well,
you
guys,
you
take
care
of
yourselves.
I
won't
forget
you.
All
right,
guys,
We're
out
of
here.

Bye,
bye-bye.

All
right!

It

Adrian
Cronauer
is
on
temporary

I'll

until
he
arrives,
Right
now,
let's
play
a
song
one
of

What's
up?
I
try
to
find
Cronauer.
He
didn't
show
up
for
work
today
either.
You
know
anything
about
this?
Listen,
jerk
off,
Now
where
do
Cronauer
go?
An

His

An

An

Shit.
CRONAUER:
You
okay?
-
Yeah.
You
okay?
Come
on,
pal,
we'll
make
it.
-
Well,
how
about
that?
-
The
VC,
the
fucking
VC.
GARLICK:
CRONAUER:
GARLICK:
You
think
CRONAUER:
I
don't
know
where
they
are.
Can't
see
dick.
Like
hunting
with
Ray
Charles.
TUAN:
Didn't
you
hear?
It's
too
dangerous
staying
here.
You
don't
believe
it's
me?
Okay.
Flip
them
the
bird.
Tuan?
Hey,
there
you
are,
Cronauer.
-
How
the
hell
you
find
us,
Sparky?
We're
obviously
not
in
Cambodia.

GARLICK:

CRONAUER:
Shit.

Goddamn
it.
Our
jeep
gets
blown
off
the
road
That's
great.
You
know
why
we
ended
up
in
the
same
place?
-
Why?
we're
going
in
circles.
Stick
with
me,
CRONAUER:
[HELICOPTER
WHIRRING
Listen.
Somewhere
over
there.
There
it
is,
man,
yo!

Yo,

Hello,

hello!
Hey!
LEVITAN:
always
rinse
you

with
cold
water
You

will
look
and
feel
a
whole

better.
That's
it
for
Hygiene
in
the
Heat.
DICKERSON:
Well,
thank
you,
sergeant.

I'm
informing
you
that
you're
out
of
here.
I
want
your
bags
packed
You
don't
have
the
power.
I
am
the
authorities,
you
moron.
Oh,
I
got
your
pansy-ass
in
a
sling
now,
Who's
Tuan?
The
guys
who
flew
you
in
radioed
they
picked
up
a
South
Vietnamese
boy
with
you
and
Garlick.
Who
is
this
South
Vietnamese
boy?
He's
a
friend
from
my
class
A
friend?
Your
friend
is
a
VC
terrorist.

Yeah,
and
my
mother
is
a
werewolf,
right?
Tuan
is
also
known
as
Phan
Duc
Tho.
He's
currently
wanted
in
connection
with
several
bombings
in
the
area,
including
the
one
at
Jimmy
Wah's.
Surely,
you're
familiar
with
that
incident.
Do
you
ever
wonder
gets
into
and
out
of
VC-held
territory?
It's
dangerous
out
there.
Things
just
jump
out
at
you.
And
yet
this
boy
can
get
in
and
out
And
what
about
Jimmy
Wah's?
Didn't
you
ever
wonder
why
you
were
pulled
out
just
moments
before
the
whole
place
blew
up?
Or
are
you
normally
not
that
inquisitive?
Friends
of
Phan
Duc
Tho.
These
three
were
executed
Your
friend
is
next.
I
don't
recommend
There's
not
too
many
who
would
be
sympathetic
The
Army
is
kind
of
quirky
that
way.
A
conviction
on
a
charge
of
treason
carries
with
it
penalties
on
the
stiff
side,
I
have
arranged
for
an
honourable
discharge
provided
you
leave
without
incident.
-
Ten-hut.
Cronauer,
I'm
sorry
as
hell
about
this
thing.
Goddamn
it,
I
like
you,
son.
Most
of
all,
But
facts
are
facts.
This
could
give
the
Army
a
black
eye.
I'm
not
gonna
cover
for
you
this
time,
son.
Sir?
What
about
the
show?
TAYLOR:
I'm
sorry,
son.
Why'd
you
do
this?
I
don't
like
your
style,
your
politics
I
don't
like
what
you
say
or
how
you
say
it.
From
now
on,
the
fighting
men
of
Vietnam
will
hear
exactly
what
they're
supposed
to
hear.
You're
on
a
DC-8
tomorrow
at
1830
hours.
I
recommend
you
pack
quietly.
That's
all
I
have
for
you,
airman.
You
know,
you're
in
more
dire
need
of
a
blow
job
Whoa,
there,
Dick,
put
the
brakes
on.
I
wanted
to
wait
Uh,
Dick,
I'm
transferring
you.
-
Transferring
me,
sir?
Where
to,
sir?
You're
going
to
Guam.
Guam,
sir?
Why
Guam?
Dick,
I've
covered
for
you
a
lot
of
times
but
you're
not
crazy,
you're
mean.
And
this
is
just
radio.

"More
dire
need
of
a
blow
job
That's
funny.
WILKIE:
When
are
you
gonna
teach
us
to
softball?
Listen,
I
gotta
talk
to
you.
-
Mr.
Cronauer,
I
must...
-
You
gotta
tell
me
where
your
brother
is.
Listen,
his
life
is
in
danger.
-
No,
I
don't
know.
Listen,
no
more
games,
okay?
The
Army
knows
about
your
brother.
I
have
to
leave
the
country
They
have
pictures
of
him.
If
you
wanna
continue
to
have
a
brother,

Tuan.

Phan
Duc
Tho!
Get
back
here!

I
know
about
the
bombings,
Sparky.
No
wonder
you
hauled
ass.
You
were
my
friend.
I
trusted
you.

TUAN:
You
naive
man,
Cronauer.
Now
you
have
to
go.
It's
better
off.
That's
not
the
fucking
point!
You
understand
me?
I
fought
to
get
you
into
that
bar,
Listen.
I
gave
you
my
friendship
and
my
trust
and
now
they
tell
me
that
my
best
friend
Enemy?
What
is
enemy?
You
killing
my
own
people
We
not
the
enemy.
You
the
enemy.
You
used
me
to
kill
two
people.
Big
fucking
deal.
My
mother
is
dead.
And
my
older
brother,
Shot
by
American.
My
neighbour,
dead.
His
wife,
dead.
Why?
Because
we
not
human
to
them.
We
only
little
Vietnamese.
And
I'm
stupid
enough
Wait...
We're
here
to
help
this
country!
The
fuck
you
going?
It's
unbelievable.
Five
months
in
Saigon,
This
will
not
look
good
on
a
résumé!
-
You
guys
mind
if
I
drive?

It's
a
simple
rule.
If
the
engine's
humming,
it's
already
started.
Never
fail
you.
You
guys
mind
I
got
something
I
gotta
do.
MP:
If
you
attempt
to
deviate
you're
under
arrest,
Cronauer.
CRONAUER:
Go
into
conference.
-
Okay,
here
we
go.
Heading
north.
Let's
go
whether
it's
a
double
or
a
daiquiri.
WOMAN:
CRONAUER:
A
little
conference
here,
Wilk.
This,
Cronauer,
not
a
real
baseball.
You
got
me
there,
Wilk,
because...
And
I
gotta
get
on
a
plane
-
Give
me
your
hand.
-
Thank
you.
Thank
you
all
the
same,
and...
-
You
wanna
take
the
ball?
Okay,
we
gotta
play,
Wilk.
I
want
to
turn
in
the
ball
Okay,
let's
take
one
more
ball
here.
-
This
one's
a
better
one.
We
haven't
got
a
real
baseball,
Wilk.
-
We
haven't
got
the
money,
pal.
-
Okay,
that
one,
okay?
Okay,
let's
just
play
-
Okay.
-
That's
a
deal.
Take
the
ball,
will
you?
-
No.
I'm
sorry.
-
Okay.
Can
we
have...?


Yeah!
Run,
run,
run!
MP:
He's
not
out
Keep
your
eye
on
the
fruit.
That's
it,

-
Yeah,
go,
run,

Run!

Keep
going!
Keep
going!
She's
actually
going
home.
-
That's
it.
We're
having
a
good
time.
Wilk,
Wilk.
Yes!
CRONAUER:
Yeah,
me
too.
Hey,
hey.
When
you
look
like
Goliath
so
like
you

MI
NH:
Oh,
Mr.
Cronauer,
we
say
thank
you
And
we
learned
a
lot
from
you.
And
we
wish
you
good
luck
and
success.
-
Thank
you,
Wilkie.
-
Thank
you.
-
Can
you
give
me
a
minute?
Man,
he's
gonna
say
goodbye
I
want
to
say
goodbye
before
you
go.
To
tell
you,
thank
you
for
being
so
kind.
So
many
things
not
happen
the
way
you
want
them.
You're
so
good
person,
and
I
could
not
with
you.
We
are
so
different.
I
say
tomato,
you
say
cây
tomat.
See
you.

Staggers
the
imagination.

Makes
me
unique,
doesn't
it?
Flip
them
a
bird!

SOLDIERS:
Three,
four.
SERGEANT:
Left,

-
Three,

It
was
a
pleasure
making
your
acquaintance,
sir.
Thanks.
CRONAUER:
Will
you
cut
that
out?
What
will
I
do
without
you,
sir?

"Carry
on,
Montesque.
Carry
on."
I
like
that.

I
want
you
to
play
this.
It
says
goodbye
to
everybody
staying
behind.
GARLICK:
I'll
take
care
of
it
pronto,
sir.
Requisitioned
for
a
name
change.
"Trouble"
is
actually
my
new
middle
name.
I'm
gonna
give
you
It's
a
stupid
thing
to
do,
isn't
it?
You
take
care.
All
right?
Your
fly
is
open.
Made
you
look.

This
is

to

It's
1629
hours

Adrian
Cronauer
is
going
home
today.
But
he
left
a
farewell
message
still
sweating
it
out
in
the
fields.
So
without
further
ado,
CRONAUER
:
That's

I'm
history.
I'm
out
of
here.

No,
it's
not

to
know
one
