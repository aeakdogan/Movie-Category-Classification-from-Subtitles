You're

All

If
you're
gonna

No

believe

Yes,
Nguyen
has
an
infant
child
here...
...but
we
haven't
seen
her
No
one
has.
She
just
disappeared?
Does
she
have
any

She
has
a

She

Thank
you,

We'll
talk
to

NICOLE:
I
don't

Lanh
will
talk
to
you.
She's
quite
political.
She
doesn't
like
Americans.
Is
she
VC?
She's
political.
I'd
be
happy
to
talk
to
her
if
you'd
like.
I
think
we'd
better
But
maybe
you
could
come

Yeah,

Are
you
uncomfortable,

You're

not.
I

Perhaps
there

can
ask

this
is

If
anything
comes
up...
...please

I
