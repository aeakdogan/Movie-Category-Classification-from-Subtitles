"Dear
Mr.
Inman,
"l
began
by
counting
the
days,
"then
the
months.
"l
don't
count
on
anything
anymore
"and
the
silent
fear
that
in
the
years
this
war,
this
awful
war,
will
have
This
poor
boy's
from
Alabama,
-
He's
a
long
way
from
home,
Why
don't
them
Yanks
just
attack?

Got
any
shirts,
son?
Mm-hm-hm-hm
It's
Mo
Oakley's
boy,
Can't
be
old
enough
to
fight,
can
he?
-
Good
morning,
Got
some
boots
and
jackets,
-
Here,
You
want
that?
I
hope
these
boots
can
hold
up
'cause
they're
taking
me

"l
think
now
"and
wish
I
could
repair
them.
My
awkward
nature,
All
right,
that's
it,
Enough
powder
here

Yeah,
Mm-hm-hm-hm
That
old
book
of
yours
is
in
shreds,
Same
as
us,
Seen
too
much
war,
Hey,
Oakley,
Don't
worry,
son,
They
ain't
open
yet,
Close
it
up,
-

Hey,
where'd
you
come
from?
-

He's
mine,
Butcher,
-
Hey,
I
saw
him
first,

I
saw
it
first!
Get
your
paws
off
my
rabbit!



"When
I
came
with
my
father
"l
was
so
shy
of
how
I
looked,
"so
out
of
place.
"But
did
you
know
how
happy
I
was
from
a
world
of
slaves

What
do
you
fools
think
-

The
South?

Damn

Last
time
I
checked,

Never
figured

Fightin'

Men

Son,
this
fellow
says
What
about
"Bonaparte's
Retreat"?

No,
Play
me
somethin'
sweet,
Like
a
girl's
waiting
for
me,
-
You
heard
him,
Like
when
you're
at
Bishop's
Creek,,,
and
you're
thirsty,,,
and
the
water's
so
cool,
I
don't
knowwhat
music
that
is,

I'm
reachin'
Cold
Mountain
before
you,

Good
morning,
Sally,

-
Well,
that's
a
fine-sounding
thing,
My
piano,
Oh,
I've
been
missing
it,
Thank
you,
by
the
way,
Oh,
dear,

And
then
he
had
nothing
to
say,
He
was
happy,
Really?
Are
men
so
different
in
Charleston?
Men?
I
don't
know,
If
you're
sayin'
you
might
like
him,
I
should
be
gettin'
along,

Walk
on,
quickly,
Come
on,
Walk
on,
Slowly,
Walk
on,

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,

My
dear
daughter,
Ada,
who's
given
up
so
much
for
so
long
to
help
Friends,
we
are
both
very
happy
to
thank
you
from
our
hearts,,,
for
your
kind
welcome

So,,,

,,,thank
you,
and
God

Our
house
is
always
open
Welcome,
Esco?
That
gentleman
-

build
the
chapel?

Him?
No,
that's
Teague,
At
one
time
the
Teague
family
My
farm,
your
farm,
Teague
wanted
this
place
bad,
And
he's
here
sniffin'
out
an
advantage,

There's
no
advantage
here,
And
that
is
a
good
thing
-

Miss
Monroe,
-
Were
you
never
planning
to
come
inside?
-
There's
a
good
fire
going,

You're
always
carrying
a
tray,
I
was
going
to
take
some
root
beer
Somebody
said
you
were
enlisting,
-
Are
you?
-
Did
you
get
a
picture
made?
A
tintype,
with
your
musket
You're
laughin'
at
me,
I
don't
know
you,
This
doesn't
come
out
right,
If
it
were
enough
just
to
stand,
It
is,
It
is,
You,,,
Look,
Look,
Look
at
the
sky
now,
Or
the
way,,,
a
hawk
flies?
Or
you
wake
up,,,
and
your
ribs
are
bruised
What
do
you
call
that?
I'll
do
that,
I
can't
get
much
wetter,

"What
if
you
are
killed,
"You
said
after
a
few
years
"Oh,
lnman.
It
is
more
than
three
years,
Soldiers,
Don't
get
up,
You
are
mentioned
tonight
in
my
report,
You
men
from
Cold
Mountain
have
There
are
Yankees
in
that
stand
of
trees
If
they
stay
there,
tomorrow
mornin'
Go
around,
-


How
many
of
them
are
there?

I
think
there's
five,

Under
the
trees,
-

We
got
'em,

Butcher's
down,

Leave
him,
leave
him,

Go,
go!
Go!
Run!
-
Go!
Go!
Go!


It's
us!
It's
us!
I
said
hold
your
fire!
Hold
your
fire,


Leave
him,
Leave
him,
Agh!

lnman'll
get
it.
Supposed
to
bring
good
luck,

I'm
so
sorry
to
have
kept
you


-
Mr,
lnman,
-
What
can
I
do
for
you?
It
belonged
to
my
father,
Thank
you,
-
You
must
come
in,
Mr,
lnman
is
more
comfortable
outdoors,
Perhaps
we
might,,,
A
splendid
idea,
Let
me
just
get
your
hat,
I
dragged
my
poor
daughter
400
miles
because
my
doctors,
So
the
air's
supposed
to
do
me
good,
But
it's
the
view
I
think
heals,

It's
what
people
say
I
have
no
plans
to
preach
war
I
imagine
God
is
weary
of
being
called
I
imagine
God
is,
Thank
you,
Now,
your
father
played
the
piano,
did
he?
That's
right,
He
was
a
teacher,
And
is
your
father
living,
Mr,
lnman?
-
He
is
not,
No,
sir,
She
died
when
I
was
born,

Farewell,
vain
world
I'm
going
home
My
savior
smiles
and
bids
me
come
And
I
don't
care
to
stay
here
long
Sweet
angels
beckon
me
away
To
sing
God's
praise
in
endless
day
And
I
don't
care
to
stay
here
long
Right
up
yonder,
Christians
-
Secession,
O,
yes,
my
Lord,
Whoo!
-
We
got
our
war!
¡Ó...
that
I
am
born
to
die
From
grief
and
woe
my
soul
shall
fly
And
I
don't
care
to
stay
here
long
Bright
angels
shall
convey
me
home
Away
to
New
Jerusalem
And
I
don't
care
to
stay
here
long
We
got
our
war!
We
got
it!
Whoo!
-
All
right!
Ready
to
fight,
son,
ready
to
fight,
Whoo!
We

sudden,
That's

Home
Guard

Haywood
County,

Hey,
Teague,
'Cause
he's
too
old,
-
Yeah!
Whoo!
You

be
safer
back
in
Charleston,
-
But
then

be
waiting
for
you?
-
All
right,
Hip
hip
hurrah!
Hip

hurrah!
Hip

Inman,
It
belongs
to
lnman,
I

it,
He's
here,
They
found
that
book
Wait,
I
found
you
this
book
to
take
with
you,
William
Bartram,
They
tell
me
it's
good,
I
think
he
writes
about
these
parts,
Thank
you,
And
this,
I'm
not
smiling
in
it,
I
don't
know
how
to
do
that,
hold
a
smile,


-
Ada,

-
Whoa!
Kiss
her
for
me,
Come
on,
let's
go,
I'll
be
waiting
for
you,

Lookin'
good,
Butcher,

Bring
home
Yee-haw!

Look
out
the
window,
ladies.
How
many
would
still
lose
a
leg
Most
of
these
soldiers'll
be
dead
by
I've
other
men
outside
so
any
kind
word
will
be
a
blessin',

It's
the
heat,
I'm
sorry,
They
rot,
Pigeon
River,,,

How
are
you,
son?
Cold,,,
Mountain,,,
I-I'm
sorry,
-
You
want
water?
Cold
Mountain?
Cold
Mountain,
Do
you
worry
when
there's
no
word
Yes,
But
then
I've
tried
countin'
which
have
passed
between
Mr,
lnman
But
I
think
about
him,
Daddy,
all
the
time,
I
lost
your
mother
It
was
enough
to
fill
a
life,

That
was
the
last
of
the
ham,
-

It
was
delicious,
I
was
thinking
of
saying
Perhaps
some
of
the
womenfolk
I
can't
have
people
coming
here
I
so,,,
I
so
regret,,,
I
should
have
raised
you
less
like
a
I'm
sorry,
Ada,
I'm
not
sorry,
I
would
have
followed
you
anywhere,
-
To
Mongolia,
But
with
no
one
left
to
work
this
place,
I
just
don't
know
how
we're
gonna
Will
you
play
me
somethin'?
Somethin'
It's
too
damp
out
here,
No,
I
like
it,

Daddy,
bring
the
tablecloth
in,
Come
inside
before
you
drown,




You
have
a
letter,
North
Carolina,
It's
come
a
long
way,
It's
not
too
recent,
It's
written
this
past
winter,
I'm
afraid
I
can't
read
who
it's
from,
"Dear
Mr,
lnman,,,"

"Since
you've
left,
time
has
been
"Last
fall,
my
poor
father
died.
"Our
farm
at
Black
Cove
is
abandoned.
"Every
house
in
these
mountains
"Each
day
the
dread...
who
will
not
return
from
this
terrible
war.
"And
no
word
from
you.
"Are
you
alive?

pray
to
God
you
are.
"This
war
is
lost
on

is
being
lost

over
He
ain't
comin'
back,
you
know
that,
You
must
know
that
in
your
heart,
Look
at
me,
-

I'm
not
nothin',

"I'm
still
waiting,
"But
I
find
myself
alone
too
embarrassed
to
keep
taking
Ada!
It's
Sally!
Ada!

Look
at
the
state
of
this
place,
-
Well,
set
it
on
the
porch,

She
let
them
slaves
go
free,
Poor
soul,
she's
got
nobody
and
nothin',

Shoo!

Go
away,

Devil!
"My
last
thread
of
courage
now
"and
to
believe
I
will
see
you
again.
"So
now
I
say
to
you,
plain
as
I
can...
"if
you
are
fighting,
stop
fighting.
"lf
you
are
marching,
stop
marching.
"Come
back

"Come

Wounded

don't

Hey!

back
to
fight,,,

Hey,
get
your
peanuts
now,
-
Hey,
your
hot
goobers
here,
Gettin'
better,
soldier?
Seems
that
way,
I
wouldn't
hurry,
The
war's
almost
done,


You
got
ten
minutes
now,
boys,
Ten
I've
been
meanin'
to
ask
you,

Oh,
before
I
was
born,
Never
set
eyes
on
a
thing
in
this
world,
Not
a
tree,
a
gun
or
a
woman,

-
What
would
you
give
for
that?
-
To
have
your
eyeballs
for
ten
minutes,
I
wouldn't
give
an
lndian
head
cent,
-
Might
turn
me
hateful,
No,
that's
not
the
way
I
meant
it,
You
said
ten
minutes,
It's
havin'
a
thing
and
then
Then
we
don't
agree,
There's
not
much
l
Yeah,
someplace,,,
or
someone,
You
watch
yourself,
now,
They're
shootin'
men


By
order
of
Zebulon
Vance,
governor

Is

his
rabble

Might
I
speak
with
you,
please?
This

Reverend
Monroe's,
I
don't
knowwho
would
want
a

at
the
time?
I've
got
a
little
salt
pork
you
can
have,
Keep
your
daddy's
watch,
Thank
you,
I
was
talkin'
to
some
of
the
other
womenfolk
about
maybe
lookin'
in
on
you
Oh,
no,
I
manage
very
well,
I'm
very
grateful
for
the
pork,
Which
I
intend
to
pay
for,
of

Is
everything
all
right?
Mm-hmm,

Ada,

your
people
in
Charleston?
There
are
no
people,
And
there's
no
money,
My
father
had
some
bonds
They're
worthless
now,
of
course,
They're
not
worth
anything,
I
don't
wanna
go,

You're
waiting
on
a
feller,

Look

a
horse?
Number

no
man
better'n
me,
'cause
there
ain't
no
man
around
-
I
know
your
plight,
Am
I
hard
to
hear?
I
ain't
lookin'
for
money,
I
never
cared
for
it
I
expect
to
board
and
eat,
-
I
ain't
a
servant,
if
you
get
my
meanin',
People's
gonna
have
to
empty
And
I
don't
expect
to
work
Right,
Right,
Is
that
a
yes
or
a
no?

There's
a
rooster,
I
go
near
him
He's
Lucifer
himself,
-
I
despise
a
floggin'
rooster,
Oh,
no,
I
wouldn't,,,
My
name's
Ruby
Thewes,
-


Let's
put
him
in
a
pot,

Mm-hm-hm-hm
Mm-hm-hm-hm
Mm-hm-hm-hm
Mm-hm-hm-hm

Urgh!
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm
I've
gone
to
find
my
ain
true
love

You're
my
angel,
my
butterfly,
Come
fly
away,

My
love,,,
God
forgive
me
for
doin'
this,
I'm
so
sorry,
I'm
sendin'
you
to
a
better
place,

You
go
fly
away,
Hey!
-
Don't
do
that,
-
I
killed
several
of
them,
What
part
of
God's
business
A
slave
woman,
Can
you
see
that
in
this
light?
-
Is
she
dead?
Iike
you
would
a
butterfly,
And
I
care
for
her,
She's
got
my
bastard
in
her
belly,
Come
on,
Back
up,

-
I'm
beggin'
you,
It's
better
you
blow
out
my
brains
You're
gonna
put
her
back
I
do
that,
the
members
will
lynch
me
for
sirin'
a
bastard
while
servin'
as
We've
churched
men
So
you
reckon
to
kill
her?

I,,,
um,,,
There's
a
back
door,
Have
pity,
Thank
you,
I
was
gonna
do
a
grievous
wrong,
I
think
I
should
go
back
up
to
my
wife,
She
wakes
at
the
slightest
noise,
Agh!
Ohh,,,
Where's
some
paper
and
a
pencil?


-

-
Yes,
Wha,,,?
It's
still
dark,
Tell
that
to
the
cows,
It's
late,
You
all
set?
Oh,
l-I
just
have
to
eat
somethin',
Well,
then,
you
got
to
get
up
earlier,
A
novel,
You
wanna
carry
a
book,
We
got
our
own
story,
I
can
spell
it,
too,
Learned
it
the
same
place
One
of
the
first
words
they
taught
me,
"Ruby
Thewes,
Three
years
I
was
in
school,
Sayin'
God
rest
his
soul
is
like
He
lived
to
rest,
He
was
born
tired,
He
decided,,,
better
use
for
me
than
havin'
me
sat
all
day


Number
one,
lay
out
a
winter
garden
Turnips
right
there,
onions,
cabbage,
Collards,
Number
two,
Have
we
got
a
maul
and
frow?
-
Maul?
Number
three,
clear
and
turn
this
field,
No
harm
done
lettin'
it
go,
Number
1
5,,,
1
8,
-
Number
1
6,,,
Put
up
some
gourds
for
a
martin
colony,
One
thing
in
abundance
on
this
farm,

I'd
pay
a
dollar
for
an
egg,
I've
got
no
quarrel
with
you,
Hey!
Am
I
near
the
Cape
Fear
River?
-

Home
Guard!
Get
back
there!
-

Runaways!


Come
on,
boys!

Let's
get
'em!

They're
spreadin'
out
in
the
field!
-

Come
back
here!

They're
in
the
field!


I
can
get
you
outta
here,
I
daresay
that's
Home
Guard
followin'
you,
They're
out
on
the
road,
And
I
don't
recommend
that
way,
You'll
meet
half
the
town
comin'
after
me
I
should
have
shot
you
I
know
where
there's
a
ferry
crossin',
-

If
this
is
a
trap,,,
-
You
got
any
money?
For
$5
I
wouldn't
give
a
parched
man
The
sign
says
"Ferry
$5,"
Nobody
crosses
these
waters
You
wanna
wait
for
your
friends?
I
can
give
you
$30
Confederate,
Well,
all
right,
let's
go,
Whatever
that's
worth,
They
cut
off
my
hair,
That
was
hard,
I
was
vain
about
my
hair,
I
had
curls,
But
I
deserved
it,
I'm
the
Reverend
Veasey,
No,
Not
likely
to,
neither,
I'd
say
these
days,
the
devil
rules
the
roost,
30
more
dollars,
and
I
can
pull
this
dress
over
my
head,
Have
we
got
$30?

-
Get
down!
-
Is
there
any
other
way
to
cross?

What's
this
wood?
-
I
don't
know,
-
I
don't
know,
-
Locust?
North?
Uh,,,
Name
me
three
herbs
I
can't,
I
can't,
all
right?
I
can
talk
about
farming
in
Latin,
I
can,,,
I
can
read
French,
I
know
how
to
lace
up
a
corset,
I
can
name
the
principal
rivers
in
Europe,
Just
don't
ask
me
I
can,,,
I
can
embroider
I
can
arrange
cut
flowers
If
a
thing
has
a
function,
then
it
wasn't
considered
suitable!
Why?
Ruby,
you
can
ask
why
about
This
fence
is
about
the
first
thing
that
might
produce
an
actual
result,

So
you
never
wrapped
your
legs
Oh!
Come
on,


Fine
piano,



If
we're
careful,
I
got
old
man
Roy
on
account
of
I
said
they's
so
small,
put
together
they
weren't
no
bigger
My
father
I
cut
off
my
hair
once
for
money,
My
daddy
got
$2
for
it,
I'm
just
sayin'
Ruby,
it
was
my
idea,
Stobrod
liked
to
call
himself
a
musician,
My
daddy,
Got
hisself
shot
dead
at
Petersburg,
I
was
like
his
goat,
Or
some
critter
tethered
to
a
post,
He
left
me
once,
I
was
eight,
He
left
you?
Uh-huh,
I
was
all
right,
My
daddy,
he'd
walk
40
miles
for
liquor

I'm
so
plugged
up,
Used
to
be
as
regular
as
morning
prayers,
Matter
of
fact,
Open
my
gut
now,
they'd
find
turds

Home
Guard!

-
Hey,
-
Look
at
this,
Look
at
this!
-
It's
a
good
saw!
You're
a
Christian,
You'll
find
the
good
Lord
We
could
do
a
lot
with
this
saw,
Cut
down
a
tree,
You're
gonna
thank
me
for
this
saw,
I'll
say
thank
you
when
I've
lost
you
You'll
see,
Shh,
Good
day
to
you,
My
old
bull,,,
wandered
off,,,
Poisonin'
up
ourwater
Thank
you,
-
That's
a
rank
odor
from
that
animal,
-
This
is
a
tricky
one,
You
fellers
help
me
out,
I'm
gettin'
an
idea,
My
saw's
the
remedy,
I
believe
you
need
two
people,
Yeah,
Give
me
that
saw,
Let's
do
this
in
chapters,
-
That's
right,
Start
at
the
neck,
Aw,,,!

Oh,

That
is
unpleasant,

There's
my
place,
Hope
you
can
stomach
Oh,

God,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah!
Oh,

There's
a
war

Get
off
my
land,
-
Your
boys

They're
out
fightin'
other
boys,
So

'Cause

here,
We
think
you've
got
'em
What
I
gotta
give
you?
Sure,
The
thing
is,
you've
only
got
one
barrel,
And
there's
five
of
us,
King
of
kings!
Hey!
What
was
that?
Aargh!
You're
harboring
deserters,
I
could
Every
plate,
every
sheep,
I
could
confiscate
your
old
lady's
asshole,
So
don't
you
offer
me
no
bird,



Come

boys!
Mama's
callin'!


Mama!

Buggery

Oh,
God,
Sally?
Ada!
All

all
right!

Darlin',

She's
sayin'
"Don't

Go!

Get
her
neck!
-
Sally!
This
world
won't
stand
long,
God
won't
let
it,,,
stand
this
way
long,
-
How
long
have
I
been
sleepin'?
-
I
can't
stop
here,
I'm
a
deserter,
If
they
find
me
here,
What
are
they
gonna
do?

I've
learned
a
person
A
goat
gives
you
company,
and
milk,
and
cheese,
and,
when
you
need
it,
good
meat,
That's
my
beauty,
There's
my
beauty,
So
you
been
fightin',
I
could
be
at
killin',,,
for
days,
my
feet
against
the
feet
of
my
enemy,
And
I
always
killed
him,
He
never
killed
me,
I
don't
know
why,
Gave
it
a
try,
to
look
at
ya,
Yeah,
I
guess
he
did,
See,
I
think
there's
a
plan,
There's
a
design
You
look
at
nature,
Bird
flies
somewhere,
picks
up
a
seed,
Bird's
got
a
job,
And
you've
got
a
job,
You
done
good,
goat,
You
were
a
real
beauty,

Sometimes
I
think
I'm
crazy
Now
drink
this,
Is
she
waitin'
for
ya,
She
was,
I
don't
know,
Or
even
if
she
knows
me,
Lie
down,
I'm
like
the
boy
and
comes
back
in
spring
with
a
whistle,
Like
every
fool
sent
off
to
fight
That's
the
laudanum
gettin'
to
ya,
Say
somethin'
more,

She
got
me
a
book,
Ada
Monroe,
A
man
by
the
name
of
Bartram,
He
wrote
about
his
travels,
Sometimes,,,
just
readin'
the
name
of
a
place,,,
near
home,,,
Sorell
Cove,
Bishop's
Creek,
Those
places
To
the
Cherokee,
What
did
he
call
Cold
Mountain?
How
could
a
name,,,
break
your
heart?
It's
her,
She's
the
place
I'm
headin',
And
I
hardly
know
her,
And
I
just
can't
seem
to
get
back
to
her,

"To
have
traveled
so
far,
a
thousand
terrible
miles.
"
I
have
to
close
my
eyes,
"My
feet
treadin'
all
God's
surface
-
"his
ocean,
his
swamps,
"to
find
myself,
at
last,
"from
whence
I
beheld
a
world
of
mountains

Ada!
Ada!
-
It's
a
man!
Raidin'
our
corncrib!
-

Help!
Help!
Damn,
Listen
up!
You
got,,,
Aim!
You
got
a
barrel
trained
on
your
rear
end!
-
Get
me
outta
this
dang
thing!
No,
ma'am,
I'm,,,
Unbelievable,
-
Stobrod
Thewes!
Agh!

That's
my
daddy,
Just
so's
you
know,

Just
so's
you
know,
Number
one,
they
hang
people
round
here
Number
two,
you'd
still
eat
outside,
-
You're
scarred,
Your
heart,
Scarred,
You'd
be
scarred,
You'd
be
real
scarred
if
-
Which
was
my
idea,
-
I
hurt
you,
I
made
up
50
tunes
with
you
in
mind,
Ruby
this,
Ruby
that,
Hey!
Let's
agree,
You
beat
me,
then
you
beat
me
some
more,
And
all
of
that
is
better'n
I'm
changed,
People
change,
War
changes
people
somethin'
terrible,
Ruby's
told
you,
I've
no
doubt,
You
were
an
asshole!
I
can't
disagree
with
that,
-
Would
you
get
him
outta
here?
I'm
full
of
music,
Ruby,
I
wish
I'd
brung
my
fiddle,
Hey,
Ruby,
I
got
a
new
fiddle,
Oh,
it's
a
beautiful
fiddle,
It's
full
of
tunes,
-
You're
all
set,
Bless
you
both,
All
right,
then,
Ain't
you
got
a
proper
coat?
Aw,
darlin',
I'm
fine,
you
know,
And
you
just
Don't
wanna
put
you
or
your
mistress
here
I'm
not
Ruby's
employer,
Oh,
Beg
pardon,
Nobody
is,
Oh,
You
know
who
really
needs
a
coat,
darlin'?
We're
hidin'
up
in
a
cave
and
Pangle,
he
feels
the
cold
like
I
love
you,
Ruby,
In
case
the
sky
falls
on
our
head,
You
always
were
a
good
girl,
Ooh!
He's
so
full
of
manure,
that
man,
We
could
lay
him
in
the
dirt
and,,,
That's
medicine,
that's
goat
meat,
And
you're
sick
of
both,
I
have
a
deal
to
thank
you
for,
That's
just
for
show,

Ruby
with
the

"My

it,
I'm
well
aware,
"My
love
for
Heathcliff
"A
source
of
little
visible
delight,
"but
necessary,
"He's
always,,,
always
in
my
mind,"
She
ain't
gonna
marry
Linton,

she?
You
can't
say
that
about
Heathcliff
Hmm,
We'll
find
out,
Tomorrow,

If
Ruby
finds
out
we've
spent
the
night,

"My
love,
where
are
you?
"With
no
hope
of
reaching
you,
"as
I
always
do,
as
I
have
always
done.
"
I'm
alone,
but
I
don't
worry
'Cause
I'm
sittin'
on
top
of
the
world

You
reckon
we
could
eat
this?
Hey,
Well,
you
know,
you
cook
somethin'
It's
froze,
-
You
hungry?
Not
very
long,




Good
evenin',
Hope
we
didn't
disturb
you,
D'you
mind
if
I
warm
myself
by
your
fire?
Name's
Teague,
-
Do
I
know
you?

-
That
your
wife?
Is
"he"
your
wife?
We're
musicians,
Your
sweetheart's
got
-
He
looks
pretty
romantic
by
the
fire,

You
gonna
play
that
fiddle?
Sure,
Sure,
Hey,
wake
up,
Evenin',
missis,
-
Where's
Georgia?

-
Captain
Teague
wants
us
to
play
now,
We
heard
there
were
some
deserters
-
Not
come
to
my
ears,
-
No,
sir,
No,
right,
No,
no,
There
is
a
cave
right
up
near
Bearpen
-
Never
occurred
to
me
they
were
outliers,
He's
always
gettin'
lost,
That
cave
-
we
live
there,
I
used
to
freeze
up
in
that
cave
Ruby
made
me
this
coat,
This
part
belonged
to
a
reverend
Ruby
said
-
what
is
it?
-
He
don't,,,
He
got
a
mind
-
It's
a
good
coat,
I
wish,
I
wish
my
baby
was
born
And
sittin'
on
its
papa's
knee
And
me,
poor
girl
And
me,
poor
girl,
were
dead
and
gone
And
the
green
grass
growin'
o'er
my
feet
I
ain't
ahead,
nor
never
will
be
Till
the
sweet
apple
grows
The
owl,
the
owl
Is
a
lonely
bird
It
chills
my
heart.
With
dread
and
terror
That
someone's
blood
Someone's
blood
There
on
his
wing
That
someone's
blood
There
on
his...
feather
Broke
my
young
heart,

We
gonna
be
here
all
night?
Stand
over
there,
Ruby,
she
don't
know
You
don't
have
to
worry
yourself
about
her,
Or
Ada,
neither,
You
too,
We
gonna
get
our
tintype
made?
Don't
smile,
-
What?
He
always
smiles,
I
told
him,
there
ain't
nothin'
in
this
world
Put
your
hat
over
your
face,
Cover
your
face
with
your
hat,
-

Ruby!
-
Ruby!
-
Teague,,,
The
Home
Guard,,,
They
shot
your
daddy!
They
shot
your
daddy,
and
Pangle
too!
I
told
Georgia
he
can
stop
here,
He's
got
nothin'
inside
him,
He
can
milk
the
cows,
It's
five
hours'
climb
from
here,
I'm
ready,
You
know
them
fools
That's
Stobrod
Thewes,
Can't
do
Left
tracks
in
the
snow
all
the
way
up
-
Sign
that
says
"Shoot
me."
Ruby,
I'm
sorry,
Every
piece
of
this
is
man's
bullshit,
They
call
this
war
a
cloud
over
the
land,
but
they
made
the
weather,
and
then
they
If
I
cry
one
tear
for
my
daddy,
All
right,
then,
All
right,
then,
Dear
God,

Oh,
dear
God,
He
ain't
here,
Agh!
Teague's
probably
took
him,
They
did
that
with
the
Swanger
boys,
Strung
'em
up,
as
a
warnin',
They
took
his
coat,
Why
would
they
take
his
coat?

Daddy?
Daddy!
Daddy!
-
Daddy?
He's
still
breathin'!
It's
Ruby!
Don't
you
die
on
me
again!
-
We
gotta
get
him
home,
He's
got
hardly
no
blood
left
in
him,

There
it
is,
I
feel
it,
-
You
got
it?

There's
a
place
close.
It's
got
shelter,
water.
I
used
to
hide
up
there
God!
-
I'll
go
look
for
some
food,
Goddamn,

Turn
around!
Go
back
where
you
came
from!
Go
back!
Ada?
Ada
Monroe?
Turn
around
or
I'll
shoot!
Inman?
Inman?

lnman,
You
better
come
with
me,
Ruby,
This
is
lnman,
Oh!
Congratulations!
Oughta
send
you
out
with
a
shotgun
Looks
if
he's
about
to
topple
over,
-
I
may
need
to,
Not
lately,
-
He's
asleep,
-
Your
man
looked
tuckered
out,
In
Sally
Swanger's
well,
-
Well,
there
you
go,
In
the
well
it
was
as
if
he
were
falling,
-
You
probably
just
don't
remember
it
right,
There
were
crows
-
black
crows,
They
were
flyin'
towards
me,
Ruby,
I
thought
I
was
seein'
him
fall,
Instead,
I
was
seein'
him
come
back
to
me,
I
got
big
plans
for
that
farm,
I
know,
I
know
you
have,
I
got
a
vision
in
my
mind
I
don't
know,
Ruby,
All
this
while
How
do
I
make
it
melt?

Hey!
You
about
done
with
my
knife?
We
got
a
bird
to
cook,

Just
about,
You're
makin'
a
pig's
ear
of
that
job,
Give
it
to
me,
Oh,
I
ain't
gonna
cut
you,
Can't
see
that
it'd
make
You
got
the
right
feelings
for
her?
Don't
turn
your
head!
Tsk,
I
do,

I'm
sorry,
Did
you
get
my
letters?
I
got
three
letters,
I
carried
them,
The
Bartram,
I
probably
sent
1
03,
Did
you
write
to
me?
Whenever
I
could,
If
you
never
got
them,
I
can
summarize,
-
No,
No,
no,
"l
pray
I
am
in
your
thoughts,
You
are
all
that
keeps
me
How
did
I
keep
you?
We
barely
knew
each
other,
A
thousand
moments,
They're
like
a
bag,,,
Don't
matter
if
they're
real
The
shape
of
your
neck,
That's
real,
The
way
you
felt
under
my
hands
You
were
plowing
a
field,
You
were
carrying
a
tray,
-
You
wouldn't
come
in,
So
that's
why
I
had
to
carry
a
tray,
That
kiss,
Which
I
kissed
every
day
of
my
walking,
Every
day
I
was
waiting,
Longing,
Longing
to
see
your
face,
If
you
could
see
my
inside,,,
Now,
whatever
you
wanna
name
it
-
I
think
I'm
ruined,
They
kept
tryin'
to
put
me
in
the
ground,
-
But
I
wasn't
ready,
But
if
I
had,,,
if
I
had
goodness,
If
I
had
anything
tender
in
me,
How
could
I
write
to
you
after
what
I
done,
what
I
seen?

Number
one,
shut
this
door,
Number
two,
shut
that
door,
Layin'
on
my
back,
tryin'
to
shut
out
who's
carrying
a
tray,,,
If
you
wanna
get
three
feet
up
a
bull's
ass,
just
listen
to
what
sweethearts
In
fact,
if
y'all
gonna
wimble-wimble
-
I'll
say
good
night,
Please,,,
don't
say
good
night,
Wars
make
some
things
pointless,
It's
hard
to
imagine
a
wedding,
I
think
even
my
father
Ada,
I
wanna
marry
you,
If
you'll
have
me,
Isn't
there
some
religion
where
you
just
and
you're
man
and
wife?
I
marry
you,
I
marry
you,
I
marry
you,
Why
is
that
funny?
I
think
it's
"l
divorce
you"
three
times
I
can
wait
for
you,
Oh,
lnman,
I
marry
you,
I
marry
you,
I
have
so,,,
Will
you
turn
your
back?
No,
No,
I
will
not,


I'll
lead
the
horse
-
You
two
go
ahead
now,
-
No,
We
can
all
go
together,
We're
deserters,
He's
right,
I
gather
l,,,
if
I
reckon
on
livin'
at
Black
Cove,
All
right,
then,

You
stay
on
that
horse,
And
don't
lose
it,
Gonna
need
it
back
on
the
farm,

All
right,
Daddy,
I
don't
wanna
let
you
go,
I'll
be
with
you
by
nightfall,
Ugh,
All
right,
then,
Hope
that
Georgia
boy's
-
I
knew
you
were
thinkin'
on
him,
-
I
was
thinkin'
on
swollen
udders,
-
And
before
you
say
"same
difference",,,
Miss
Lovey-Dovey!
Hey!
-
That
was
a
long
funeral
for
your
daddy,
That
was
lrish,
Now,
your
friend
Georgia
here,,,
We
went
down
to
visit
you
when
and
he
told
us
-
after
some
persuasion
-

We
were
up
and
down
Up
and
down,
There
will
be
a
reckoning,
When
this
war
is
over,
Did
you
make
this
coat?
Helpin'
a
deserter
-
that's
treason,
Now,
I
know
A
reckonin'?
The
reckoning's
for
yourworld,
-
It's
not
mine,
I'l
be
damned,

-

No!


lnman!
-



-
Come
down
from
there!
I'll
just
shoot
the
horse
out
from
under
you,
-
You
ridin'
Captain
Teague's
animal?
-
He
dead?
Look,
give
me
your
gun
and
ride
on
home,
I
give
you
my
gun,
I
will
not
shoot
you,
but
nor
am
I
goin'
down
this
mountain
That's
what
they
call
a
conundrum,
-
I'll
tell
you
what
I
got
on
my
side,
The
confidence
of
youth,
Inman!



No!
I,,,
came,,,
back,
I
love
you,


Baby,

What
we
have
lost
The
land
will
not
heal.
Too
much
blood.
The
heart.
will
not
heal.
All
we
can
do
is
make
peace
with
the
past
and
try
to
learn
from
it.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Bring
him
here,
-
Don't
kill
him,
We
have
to
try
somethin'
-

We're
gonna
try
a
little
trick,
-



There
are
days
now
When
the
needs
of
the
farm
This
time
of
year
I
find
you
in
all
of
it.
As
if
you
were
still
walking
home
to
me.
If
you
could
see
us
now
you
would
know
I'm
still
climbing
upwards
And
my
journey's
almost
ended

So,
friend,
if
you're
thirsty
Climb
this
mountain
with
me
Grace
lnman,
nobody
said
"Eat."

For
good
friends,
good
food,
good
family,
all
our
blessings,
O
Lord,
we
thank
thee,
-
Amen,
-
Amen,
-

Amen!
-
Sweetheart,
there's
no
cider,
Right,
I'd
best,,,
I
looked
once
more
down
Sally's
well,
and
this
time
Just
clouds.
Clouds,
and
then...
sun.

Well
I
recall
his
part.ing
words
Must
I
accept
his
fate
Or
take
myself
far
from
this
place?
I
thought
I
heard
a
black
bell
toll
A
little
bird
did
sing
Man
has
no
choice
When
he
wants
every
thing
We'll
rise
above
the
scarlet
tide
That
trickles
down
through
the
mountain
And
separates
the
widow
from
the
bride
Man
goes
beyond
his
own
decision
Gets
caught
up
in
the
mechanism
Of
swindlers
who
act
like
kings
And
brokers
who
break
everything
The
dark
of
night
was
swiftly
fading
Close
to
the
dawn
of
day
Why
would
I
want
him
We'll
rise
above
the
scarlet
tide
That
trickles
down
through
the
mountain
And
separates
the
widow
from
the
bride

You'll
walk
unscathed
No
plowman's
blade
will
cut
thee
down
No
cutler's
horn
will
mark
thy
face
And
you
will
be
my
ain
true
love
And
you
will
be
my
ain
true
love
And
as
you
walk
The
cannon's
thunder
can't
prevail
And
those
who
hunt
thee
down
will
fail
And
you
will
be
my
ain
true
love
And
you
will
be
my
ain
true
love
Asleep
inside
the
cannon's
mouth
The
captain
cries
"Here
comes
the
rout"
They'll
seek
to
find
me
nort.h
and
south
I've
gone
to
find
my
ain
true
love
The
field
is
cut
and
bleeds
to
red
The
cannonballs
fly
round
my
head
The
infirmary
man
may
count
me
dead
When
I've
gone
to
find
my
ain
true
love
I've
gone
to
find
my
ain
true
love
