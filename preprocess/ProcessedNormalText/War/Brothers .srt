Two

I

my
book.
Oh

Oh,

out
here.

Now,
you're
getting
a
hundred
kisses.
-
Come
on,
daddy's
got
to
go.
-
Please,
daddy.
Will
you
let
him
stay?
It's
my
brother.
He
doesn't
deserve
you.
I
feel
alive.
How
about
my
little
brother?
No
fucking
way.
Did
you
ever
think
of

It's
green.
So,

are
you
gonna

I
don't
know.
I
was
gonna...

We'll
see
you
later.
Don't

place.
You

this
place?
No

I'm
sorry.
He

your
hair
off.

My

Why

I

too.
Hey,
dad.
So

I.

When
are
you
leaving?
You
love
it
over
there,
huh.
-
It's
my
job.
Who
are
the
bad
guys?
The
ones
with
the
beards.
Your
brother's
a
hero.
He's
serving
his
country.
Will
you
be
here
for
my
birthday?
You
know
I
will
sweetie.
Sarah
Miller's
dad
wasn't
-
Isabelle.
She
had
to
bring
him
It's
not
just
military
families.
There's
a
lot
of
folks
There's
problems
in
all
Every
family
got
their
own
set
of
problems.
They
sure
do.
What's
that
suppose
to
mean?
Every
family
has
their
own
set
of
problems.
-
You
sound
like
a
damn
parrot.
Why
don't
you
try
mimicking
Dad.
This
food
is
great,
Elsie.
Compared
to
what?
-
Other
food.
Tommy!
Excuse
me.
It's
okay,
honey.
-
It's
his
first
night
out.
Stay
out
of
trouble.
Fine.
Be
safe
over
there,
alright.

It's
not
coming
off
Yeah,
I
almost
got
it.
There
you
go.

Don't
lose
that.

Stick
on
your
patience
when
I'm
gone.
I
love
you.
I

you
too.
Sam.
Take

Okay.
Don't
go.

2007
Back
in
Afghanistan
with
my
men.
Weird,
it
almost
feels
like
home.
Hi
Cassie,
George
Jr.
What's
the
distance
to
the
out
scene?
Three
minutes
up
to
the
-
Roger
that.
Who
is
it?
It's
Captain
Sanders
Hi.
-
Hi,
is
your
mother
home?
-
Where
is
she?
Would
you
call
her
for
us
please?
What's
wrong?
Issy.
Come
in.
You've
reached
Capt.
Sam
Cahill.
You've
reached
Capt.
Sam
Cahill.
Grace.
I
didn't
mean
to
wake
you
up.
I'm
just
driving
off
the
car,
Sam
told
The
tail
lights
are
all
busted.
Look,
I
don't...
Just
say
it,
you
know
what
I
mean?
He
told
me
You
look
at
me
with
this
pissed
off
look.
Sam
is
dead.
He
crashed.
-
What
are
we
talking
about?
Come
in.
What,
fucking
come
in!
I
just
came
here
to
drop
off...
-
Why
didn't
you
call
me?
-
Why
didn't
anybody
call
me!?
Okay.
-
How
did
let
him
go
over
there,
Grace?
For
what
now,
huh!
Come
inside.
Yeah,
I
just
had
to
sit
He's
with
your
mama
now.
Drink.
No.
Hey
girls,
are
you
ready?
In
about
just
one
minute.
-
Why
did
you
take
your
dress
off?
You
gotta
put
it
on,
okay.
I
don't
want
to.
I
don't
wanna
wear
mine
Okay,
come
here,
okay.
Come
here.
Is
Dad
really
dead
like
-
I'm
sorry.
-
Sorry
dear.
Sir,
your
son
is
the
best
I
appreciate
it.
Come
on
girls,
I'm
so
sorry
for
your
loss.
Grace,
Sam
wrote
this
for
you
before
he
left.
I
don't
believe
it,
John.
Shouldn't
I
be
able
to
feel
it?
It's
hard
to
accept.
-
Why
don't
you
let
me
drive?
Come
on,
girls.
-
Why
don't
you
give
me
the
keys,
Dad?
-
Let
Tommy
drive.
...why
don't
you
get
a
job
and
earn
some
money,
buy
yourself
Give
me
the
keys!
Did
you
hear
those
marines
in
there
Did
you?
Who's
gonna
stand
up
and
It's
my
fault
Sam's
dead,
right?
It's
got
nothing
to
do
with
you,
okay.
-
What
are
you
saying
to
me?
Forget
it.
-
You
never
had
any
guts.
That's
why
you
screamed
That's
why
you
drove
us
drunk.
-
Don't.
Come
on.
-
You'll
never
fill
up
my
shoes.
-
You
never
could
make
me
proud.
-
Pride
is
a
sin.
Here
you
go.
This
is
a
nightmare.
What's
going
on?
What
are
they
gonna
do
with
us?
-
Is
that
yours?
-
Is
that
your
wife?
No,
she's
not.
You
don't
have
a
wife.
You
don't
have
a
family.
The
only
person
you
know...
..
is
Private
Willis
and
Captain
Cahill.
Yes,
sir.
-
Hello.
Tommy?
Hi,
I
don't
know
it's
like
one
in
the
morning...
It's
three,
it's
three
Great.
I
had
a
couple
of
drinks.
And
apparently
they're
the
most
And
now,
I
owe
like
$47.
I
could've
just
walked
out,
but
then,
...and
then
I'd
lose
my
parole.
Which
bar?
Your
nose
is
like
a
lunar
eclipse.
-
Come
on,
let
me
touch
it.
-
Tommy,
I'm
sick
of
you.
Why
get
so
upset
with
me?
-
Alright,
go
ahead.
-
Big
deal.
-
Grace.
$47
and
two
broken
glasses.
-
...
so
how
about
we
say...
-
Get
your
hands
off
the
bar.
-
How
about
we
say
fifty?
Just
get
him
out
of
here.
Tommy,
I
have
two
little
girls
sleeping
You
think
you're
funny?
Go
home.
Oh
God!
-
My
head's
spinning.
-
I
don't
think
I
should
be
carrying
your
child.
Oh
yeah.
-
Uncle
Tommy.
Uncle
Tommy,
wake
up!
-
Can
you
stop
that?
I
can't
stop,
my
sister
said.
Stop
it.
No.
What
are
you
doing
here?
You
want
me
to
whisk
in
your
face
too?
This
is
not
your
house
and
Come
on.
I'm
making
pancakes
for
mom
-
Our
dad's
dead.
I
know
that.
-
Shut
up,
you're
gross.
No...
I
don't
like
that.
-
Our
pancakes
are
the
best.
-
Mom,
you're
supposed
to
be
upstairs.
-
Surprise!
One
of
the
nicest
little
Who's
that?
-
Grandpa!
-
Good
day
babies,
what
have
you
got
in
your
hand?
Hi,
sweetie.
-
Hey,
let's
go
watch
TV.
-
Bye
Tommy!
Good
morning.
Pancakes,
huh.
Yeah,
actually
there's
one
-
What
are
they
doing
here?
Look
um...
-
I
was
a
little
stupid
the
other
day...
-
It
was
okay
to
drive...
I
know
Sam
is
always
smarter
than
me.
Not
really
that
smarter...
He
was
a
damn
good
athlete.
Remember
that
game
Truly
delightful.
He
have
some
talent
too,
He
doesn't
quit
all
the
time.
That
was
different
between
you
and
him.
Sam
had
no
quitting
in
him.
I'll
cut
my
throat
to
bring
him
back,
Dad.
I
don't
know...
how
they
can
live
with
Private,
come
here!
I
can't
see
anything.
They're
looking
for
us.
Shit!
-
Should
we
try
again?
Come
on
man,
just
put
it
where
it
is.
Grace!
Hey!
You
remember
AJ,
Owen...
Sweeney,
I
don't
remember
your
first
name.
There
was
a
reason
for
that.
You
too.
We're
just
fixing
up
the
kitchen
for
you.
Tommy...
Are
you
ever
gonna
-
Can
you
believe
that?
She's
gorgeous.
-
Everybody's
all
grown
up.
-
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you,
guys?
You
have
to
run
this
by
me.
I
was...
-
Can
I
get
you
guys
coffee,
something?
-
Maybe
a
beer.
Don't
tell
them
anything.
They
aren't
asking
me
anything.
-
They'll
just
starve
us.
-
Be
present.
I'm
fucking
present.
I've
been
present
What
the
fuck
did
you
save
me
for?
I
should've
drowned
in
that
lake.
What
day
is
it?
Saturday.
What
time
is
it?
About
noon.
Remember
what
I
told
you.
-
You
give
them
nothing,
private.
-
Where
will
they
take
us?
-
What?
-
They're
gonna
cut
our
heads
off.
Welcome.
Use
the
satellite
phone
She
is
pregnant.
You
jeopardized
your
location
We
have
the
same
blood.
Sayid
is
my
nephew.
Fuck!
This
is
our
country.
You
should
not
be
here.
Tell
this
message
to
America.
You
say
it...
I'll
force
you
to
say
it.
The
girls
are
back.
It's
a
good
thing
downstairs.
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.
Thanks,
Elsie.
-
Oh,
she's
painting
the
kitchen.
Yeah,
that's
a
spot
right
there.
You
know,
your
dad
was
a
great
Yeah.
He
was
small
but
he
was
a
great
quarterback.
Me
and
AJ
and
Owen
used
to
go
-
Have
you
ever
had
the
chance
to
see
him
play?
-
Issy,
you're
so
tall.
-
Great
job,
Mag.
-
Do
they
need
to
do
their
homework
or
something?
Dip
it
real
good.
Shit
the
pants!
-
What
are
you
doing?
These
are
brand
new
pants.
-
Hey,
man.
Man,
she
said
she
was
sorry.
It's
okay,
Maggie.
-
Just
wait
here.
-
No,
please
don't
bring
the
paint
in
okay.
-
That's
easy,
man.
That
will
come
out?
They're
used
to
that.
It
doesn't
look
that
bad.
Right.
Let's
hug
it
out.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
What?
Stay
away
from
the
kids.
You
have
a
lovely
body,
Owen.
Laugh
at
me.
Do
you
workout?
Can
I
ask
you
where
you
got
your
underwear?
You
three
weird
guys
I'm
asking
you
a
serious
question.
-
This
should
all
fit
you.
-
Take
it
all.
You
don't
have
to
give
me
all
these.
Take
it
all,
Owen.
-
Alright,
I'll
bring
it
back.
I'm
not
fucking
asking
you.
You
want
to
help
your
friend?
No,
it's
his
turn.
-
Just
be
strong
private.
Fuck!
Don't
give
them
anything.
Private!
-
Your
life
depends
on
it.
Motherfucker!
My
name
is
Private
Joe
Willis
I
was
told
I
was
coming
here
...but
now
I
realized
that
And
we
have
no
business
being
here.
I
love
you,
Cassie.
Joe
Jr,
your
daddy
always
loves
you.
You
have
two
daughters.

Great.
Great.
Stop.

Not
Enter"
"Don't

"This
way"
"A
little
further"
Happy
Birthday!

You
like
the
kitchen.
-
Mom,
this
is
from
Deedee.
-
You're
welcome.
-
Yes,
please.

No,
she's
occupied
with
her
presents.

he
just
tell
me?
Okay,

Happy
birthday
to
you!
Happy
Birthday

Happy
Birthday!
Thank
you!

-
What
are
you
doing?
You
gotta
wait
for
her,
sweetie.
Everybody
loves
Maggie.
-
Why
do
you
say
that?
Your
dad
saved
me
in
that
water
You
know
you're
like
your
dad.
Am
I?
Am
I
like
my
mom?
Speed
and
image,
yeah.
Accept
to
yourself,
Isabelle
Come
on.
I
made
it!
I
talked
to
her
for
over
an
hour.
She
said
to
me
that
she
hadn't
She
kept
having
these
nightmares
And
then...
I
told
her
that
it
was
alright,
She
just
started
to
cry.
Right
there
in
the
bank,
And...
then
she
thanked
me.
She...
she
said
that
she
felt
like...
she's
safe.
Like
she
could
breathe
again.
Then
she
asked
if
I
wanted
No.
-
Swear
to
God.
I
opened
an
account.
I'm
proud
of
you.
I
can't
wait
to
start
When
I
was
like...
seventeen
or
eighteen.
I
used
to
listen
to
this
song
like...
-
...
over
and
over
again.
-
Really?
I
don't
know...
-
I
took
you
more
for
like
an
NSync
fan.
Give
me
that.
-
Really?
You
think
I'm
such
a
square.
I'm
starting
to
reassess
Snoop
Dogg.
Just
'cause
I'm
the
cheerleader
doesn't...
-
Yeah,
and
you
dated
a
football
player.
You
were
kind
of
a
pain
in
No,
I
wasn't.
Guys
always
that
girls
were
stocked
up
I
just
didn't
like
you.
I
have
to
get
some
air.
God!
Captain!
Take
it.
What
do
we
do?
He
has
no
value
for
us.
Just
a
weight
on
our
shoulder.
Waste
of
food
and
water.
Kill
him.
Pick
up
the
pipe.
Pick
it
up.
You
have
a
family?
Do
you
want
to
see
them
again?
Pick
up
the
pipe!
-
Captain.
Kill
him
or
I
will
kill
you.
Kill
him!
-
Kill
him
or
I
will
cut
his
head
off.
Kill
him!
There!
I
brought
you
some
molding.
Hey
look,
I
don't
wanna
ruin
anything,
alright.
Please,
I
would
love
you
We
just
miss
Sam.
Yeah.
That's
Hank.
You
still
had
it,
huh.
When
did
you
ever
learn
to
be
so
handy?
-
Got
one
there!
-
All
on
board.
We're
moving
forward.
Raise
your
hands!

Stop
right
there!
Come

your
hands
up.

your
name?
Coming!
Get
up!
Get

Nose!

He
is
looking
fat,
guys.
Did
you
teach
them
how
to
throw
I
can
defeat
you!
Maybe
I
should
give
you
the
mask.
-
Oh
come
on.
-
Issy?
-
Grace?
Get
him!
Get
him!
Hello.
Yes,
this
is
she.
You
see
this
cheater
player
over
here,
huh.
What?
What's
going
on?
-
Uncle
Tommy
she
grabbed
me
hair.
-
Can
I
go
out?
-
Why?
-
Sir.
Daddy!

We
miss
you
so
much.
My
babies.
-
Don't
cry.
Let
me
take
a
picture.
Come
on,

on,
hurry.
-
It's
amazing.
-
Who
did
it?
-
You
did.
Uncle
Tommy
and
three
amigos.
Are
you
tired,
honey?
-
Come
get
in
bed,
everyone.
-
We
missed
you,
daddy.
My
girls.
And
it's
all
so
right.
Can
I
get
up,
mom?
Dad,
it's
not
bedtime.
I
locked
that
door.
It's
broken.
I'm
just
gonna
finish
shaving.
"Hero's
Body
Comes
Home"
-
Banged
up
a
little,
huh.
Can't
you
take
that
down
to
the
mechanic?
Yeah,
I
got...
nothing
else
to
do.
Are
you
okay?
Yeah.
Is
that...
After
I
got
back
from
'Nam
I
guess
I...
take
it
out
on
you
and
Tommy.
I
don't
know
why.
If
you
ever
wanna
talk
Are
you
okay?
You're
good.
Better
than
I
thought.
You
look
good
out
there
with
them.
Thanks
for
taking
care
of
them.
-
I
didn't
expect
that.
It
makes
me
start
to
think,
you
know.
Grace
is
something,
huh.
Did
you
fuck
her?
What,
are
you
kidding?
I'd
understand.
-
You
thought
I
was
dead.
Tommy.
I
could
forgive
you.
What's
going
on
with
your
head?
What's
making
you
think
that?
You
guys
just
look
like
Really.
I
mean,
you
know...
You
can
tell
me.
You
gotta
tell
me,
you
understand?
-
I
know
you
slept
at
my
house.
Don't
bullshit
me.
Joe
Jr.,
come
back.
Cassie,
it's
fine.
Ever
since
his
dad
died
I
can't
Look
at
him!
I
had
this
nightmare
where
And
he's
trying
to
tell
me
something.
His
teeth
just
fall
out
off
and
I'm
scrabbling
around
picking
them
up.
And
then
last
night,
and
he
looks
at
my
hand
and
he
takes
my
hand
and
-
Did
he
say
anything?
But
I
hated
him.
In
the
dream,
I
hated
That's
why
I
came
over
I'm
sick
of
feeling
like
this
I
wanna
be
able
to
forgive
them.
For
Joe
Jr...
He
knows.
He's
just
like
his
daddy
who
Where
are
you
going,
huh?
-
Sam.
Did
you
see
him
die?
No.
Did
you
hear
anything?
Was
he
on
his
own?
He
was
brave.
That's
Captain
Cahill.
You're
a
good
man.
Oh
baby,
where
are
-
Sir,
Captain
Cahill.
I
wanna
go
back
sir.
I'm
ready.
How's
the
counseling
going?
Yeah,
Sir
Thompson...
everything
pretty
good
there
and...
you
know
I'm
just
thinking
about
my
men.
-
I
wanna
get
back.
How's
your
family?
-
I
can't
be
there
sir.
They
don't
understand.
I
mean,
nobody
understands.
It's
gonna
take
a
little
time,
Sam.
So
as
your
family.
I
don't
mind
Bryan.
He
never
hits
people.
-
That
is
nice.
And
he
has
a
dog
with
really
big
ears.
Elephant?
-
Elephant's
not
a
dog.
Then
why'd
you
say
it?
Because
elephants
have
big
ears
So...
Big
ears.
-
Get
it?
-
Sam,
relax.
Big
ears.
Is
Dad
okay,
Mom?
Yeah,
of
course.
-
When
is
Uncle
Tommy
coming?
Okay?
-
I'm
gonna
check...
check
on
daddy,
okay.
Sammy,
what
happened?
What's
going
on?
Talk
to
me.
What
happened?
What
did
they
do
to
you?
What
happened
with
you
and
Tommy?
We
kissed,
that's
it.
I
missed
you.
I
thought
you
were
dead.
I
couldn't
get
out
of
bed.
Are
you
telling
me
the
truth?
You
know.
Now,
tell
me...
-
I
think
you're
fucking
Tommy.
Hey,
come
on,
come
on.
Why
did
you
stop
pulling?
Hey!
Are
you
girls
playing?
What's
wrong?
It's
okay.
I
was
just
confused.
It's
gonna
be
okay.
Come
here!
Now...
those
are
my
girls.
Why
did
the
girl
blushed
She
saw
the
"salad
dressing".
Have
I
told
you
guys
that
one?
-
A
thousand
times.
Have
fun.
Where
have
you
been?
I
was...
I
was
outside.
Thinking...
and...
I
was
just
thinking
about
you...
and
the
kids
and...
the
sun
came
up
and
I
thought...
I'm
so
lucky
to
be
alive.
We're
gonna
be
late!
-
Come
on!
Come
on,
grandpa.
Can
I
open
my
present
now?
-
I
think
we
should
wait.
-
Pretty
please!
-
It
wouldn't
hurt.
-
Thank
you.
-
Okay,
mom.
Is
it
the
big
one?
-
It's
Uncle
Tommy.
Issy.
-
Hey.
What's
the
matter?
Is
she
okay?
-
Oh
Grace,
this
is
Tina.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
We're
all
in
the
dining
room.
Oh
my
God,
she's
so
pretty.
-
Hey,

This
is
Tina.
She's
an
old
friend.

Actually,

What

They're

force.
But
nobody

Just
something
that,
not
taught.
Isabelle.

Let

So

do
you
do?

Tommy

the
time.
Can

I

Sorry,
mom.
Why
did
you
say
that?
I
don't

Dad.
I'd
rather

Uncle
Tommy

instead
of
Dad.
Me
too.
Daddy's

better

If
