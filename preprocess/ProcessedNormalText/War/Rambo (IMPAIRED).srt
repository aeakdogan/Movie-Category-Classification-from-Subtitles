Thousands
took
to
the
streets
Many
peaceful
protesting
monks
have
been
killed,
Foreign
journalists
have
been
shot
and
caned..
Thousands
of
villages
have
been
destroyed.
In
Burma
there
are
more
landmines,
Young
men
are
bitten
and
forced
into
the
army.
Beheadings
and
mutilations
The
Karen
people
comprising
mostly
of
poor
Christian
The
military
government
wants
many
of
The
bloody
military
campaign
against

longest

war
in
the
world.


Hey...
ready,
send
them
out!
Let's
go!
Hey...
-
Hey,
move!
Easy,
not
gonna
hurt
you.

OK.

Looks
like
dangerous
work.
I'm
Michael
Burnett.
Do
you
have
some
time
to
talk?
It
won't
take
long,
I
promise.
I
was
told
it
might
be
possible
to
rent
your
boat.
Is
that
possible?
We
need
to
get
up
river.
Where're
you
going?
Into
Burma.
Burma
is
a
war
zone.
Look...
that's
what
people
call
it.
But
it's
more
like
genocide
than
war...
This
will
be
my
fifth
trip
in,
so...
we
are
aware
of
all
the
risk.
I
don't
go
that
far
north.
Let
me
explain
our
situation.
Our
church
is
part
of
the
Pan-Asia
located
in
Colorado.
We
are
all
volunteers,
who
bring
in
medical
supplies,
medical
attention...
prayer
books
and
support
for
the
Karen
tribe's
people.
People
say
you
know
the
river
better
than
anyone.
Well,
they're
lying.
So,
what
I'm
asking
is,
that
we
compensate
you...
for
a
few
hours
of
your
time..
that
will
help
change
people's
lives.
You're
bringing
in
any
weapons?
Of
course
not.
You're
not
changing
anything.
Oh,
well...
It's
thinking
like
that,
Fuck
the
world.
-
Let's
go
He's
not
interested.
-
Let
me
try.
-
It'll
be
an
interesting
trip
going
up
there.
-
What'd
we
have
to
lose?.
-
Let
me
try.
Hello!
I'm
Sarah
Miller,
hope
you
don't
The
man
you
were
talking
to...
I
wasn't
talking
to
anybody.
Alright...
the
man
that
was
talking
to
you...
asked
if
we
could
hire
your
boat
and
you
said
no...
why?
Can't
help
you
out.
Alright,
if
you
have
good
reasons,
Go
home.

Why'd
you
come
back?
Waiting
for
you.
I
told
you
before,
I
can't
help
you.
We
need
to
go,
and
help
these
people.
We're
here
to
make
a
difference.
We
believe
all
lives
are
special.
Some
lives,
some
don't.
Really?
If
everyone
thought
like
you,
Nothing
will
change.
Of
course
it
does.
Value
your
life,
if
you've
got
a
good
one.
It's
what
I'm
trying
to
do!
Oh,
no,
what
you're
trying
to
do
And
what
is?
Go
home.
Really.
Maybe...
Maybe,
you've
lost
your
faith
in
people.
But
you
must
still
be
thankful
for
something.
Maybe
we
can't
change
what
is,
But
trying
to
save
a
life,
As
bad
as
these
people
are,
They
can't
keep
it
up
against
a
united
front.
They
can't!
Time
alone
will
tell,
but
in
the
meantime,
I
mean,
just
the
other
day,
I
got...
Excuse
me,
Sarah?
Where're
you
going?
To
talk
to
him.
He'll
probably
wants
his
privacy.
Michael,
you
shouldn't
worry,
He's
being
paid.
He
didn't
take
anything.
Thank
you
again
for
doing
this.
Really
from
all
of
us.
You
really
never
told
us
your
name.
John.
Where're
you
from?
Del
Rio,
Arizona.
-
Why'd
you
leave?
And
you
just
stayed?
It's
complicated.
You
have
a
family
back
home?
Father
maybe,
I
don't
know.
Aren't
you
curious,
how
things
Don't
have
a
reason
for
that.
Sarah...
Because
of
you,
we're
going
anytime
you
wanna
turn
around...
...it's
done.
Ok.
What
is
it?
Burmese
pirates.
Tell
everyone
to
stay
down,
don't
make
a
sound.
-
Who
are
they?
Don't
talk!
-
Any
more
of
them?
What
you
wanna
do?
We
should
keep
going.
I
ain't
talking
to
you.
-
What'd
you
wanna
do?
Sit
down!
If
it's
money
they
want,
give
it...
Nobody
talk.
Heads
down!
Keep
your
heads
down,
and
don't
look

No...
What
did
you
do?
We
came
here
to
help
stop
the
killing.
-
Who
are
you?
They
would
have
raped
her
fifty
times,
Who
are
you?
Who
are
any
of
you?
We're
going
back.
No...
no,
we
shouldn't
go
back!
Let
go.
-
What're
you
doing?
and
what
happened
here,
is
horrible...
But
the
people
in
there,
are
Michael,
this
was
your
idea.
I
know
you
don't
believe,
But
it's
our
live.
Our
choice.
You're
not
gonna
change
anything.
Please...
Please
John.
Please.
Go
sit
down.

We'll
be
taking
the
overland
route
on
the
way
I
have
to
report
this.
I
know
you
think
what
you
did
was
right...
but
taking
a
life
is
never
right.
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
Maybe
you
shouldn't
say
anything.

Hey...
Open...

So
Christ
was

your
heart
with
faith.
We're
gonna
signify
your
faith
with
Hello
dear,
can
I
have
one
of
those
bandages?
Good.
Ok.
Let's
get
out
of
here!
...calling
Raven.
Come
in,
over...
What
am
I?
We
made
you
this
way.
You
don't
just
turn
it
off!
-
Talk
to
me
Johnny!
-
It's
over!

Aren't
you
curious,
how
things
You've
done
enough
damage!
You
will
always
be
tearing
away
soldier..
until
you
come
to
terms,
with
what
you
are.
-
So,
you're
just
gonna
stay
here
forever?
John
Rambo!
John.
John
Rambo.
My
name
is
Arthur
Marsh.
Pastor
of
the
Christ
Church
of
Colorado.
I
need
to
talk
with
you.
It's
very
important,
I
wouldn't
come
The
morning
of
the
day
the
group
left,..
Michael
Burnet
notified
me...
that
they
were
traveling
from
this
location.
What
happened?
No
one
knows
exactly.
They
were
supposed
to
return
10
days
ago,
I
requested
help
from
the
embassy,
Not
in
Burma
and
not
in
time.
How
do
you
know
they're
alive?.
Because
we've
been
in
contact
who
say,
they
think
they
know
And
I
was
given
the
name
of
an
ex-military
who
put
me
in
touch
with
men
who
say
Mercenaries?
Yeah.
I
don't
have
any
other
choices.
You
know
the
exact
spot.
to
where
you
let
our
people
off.
When're
they
ready
to
leave?
When
you
are.
You
know
what
you
are.
And
what
you're
made
off.
War
is
in
your
blood.
Don't
fight
it.
Did
you
kill
for
your
country?
Or,
kill
for
yourself?
God
is
never
gonna
make
that
go
away.
But
when
you're
pushed...
Killing
is
as
easy
as
breathing.

Look
at
this
fucking
place!
Only
a
fucking
ape
would
live
here.
What
the
fuck
am
I
doing
here?
Hey,
knock
that
shit
off!
Louis,
you
don't
like
the
arts?
-
And
you
don't
like
the
shit.
She's
got
a
thing
for
retards.
Hey
boatman!
How
much
longer
in
this
ancient
piece
of
shit?
So,
what'd
the
reverent
say
to
you?
Some
shit,
about
how
his
flock
got
missing.
I
said
to
him:
Look
mate,
that's
what
you
get
when
you
go
trespassing
into
fucking
Burma...
that's
what
you
get,
when
you
go
You
know
those
generals
in
there,
making
millions,
cranking
out
more...
-
than
any
other
person
on
this
fucking
planet.
-
Millions,
Moron.
Next
time
try
reading
the
paper,
Redneck,
The
fucking
general's
are
the
biggest
junkies
of
all
of
them.
It's
noble
Louis...
-
Do
what?
Just
books
and
meds.
It's
noble.
Oh,
schoolboy!
You
stick
your
nose
in
other
people's
business,
or
you
get
dead.
The
only
reason
I'm
doing
this,
and
after
this
shit
is
over,
you
can
-
Try
to
think
on
that,
mate!
And
you!...
I
don't
wanna
die
of
old
age,
You
say
something?





Is
it
me?
Or
does
the
air
that's
coming
in,
smell
For
fuck
sake,
I
can
swim
faster
than
this.
-
Am
I
right?
Chop,
chop...
The
quicker
we
get
there,
Those
dumb
Squalors.
They
come
over
here...
start
with
all
that
shit...
expecting
the
whole
world
to
work,
like
So,
they
send
in
the
devil...
to
do
god's
work,
it's
Ironic
isn't
it?
Am
I
boring
you,
man?
What
is
it?
Is
it
the
trip?
Because
we...
we
really
appreciate
the
action.
God
man,
look
me
in
the
eyes,
so
Oh
dear...
You
really
are
an
uptight
bastard,
aren't
you?
You
can
drop
that
act
with
the
eye
stare.
I've
seen
it
all
before.
I'm
not
fucking
impressed.
He's
old
school,
SAS.
The
first
rate
soldiers,
They
call
me
schoolboy.
The
name
stuck
with
me,
since
nitro
school...
and
the
Mates
wont
stop
calling
me,
What
do
you
want
from
us?
One
man
and
a
kid,

got
to
be

up.
You're

white
trash
bloke,

Let's

this
straight.
We
don't
engage
anybody.
But

clean,
or
we
fuck
off.
Somebody
wanna
tell
me
Hey,
why
don't
you
wait
with
the
boat.
-
My
man
will
stay
with
the
boat.
I
won't
slow
you
down.
Well,
I
know
you
won't.
-
You
can
believe
that.
Hey...
he
stays
here,
he's
the
boatman.
Only
a
white
man
with
a
fucking
dick.
Who's
got
explosives?
-
No.
-
Ive
got
a
claymore.
Let's
go
on
with
it.
-
What
the
fuck
is
that?
Your
people,
taken
from
here.
In
my
life,
I've
seen
some
shit.
-
But,
I've
never
seen
no
shit
like
this.
Check
it
out!
All
these
commies,

everything,
Mines,

At

Check

out.
Check

They're

Hey,
we
took
the
man's
money.
He's
got
it
right,
I'm
gonna
see
what's
wrong.
If
anything
is
wrong,
anything
at
all,
Yeah.
Alright.
-
Good,
which
way?
Army!
Go!

We're
gonna
fire
on
them?
No,

make
it
back
from
where
What

they
doing
there?

Who

Let's

They're
gonna
come
hunt
our
asses
down,

We
don't
need
this
shit,
we're
going
back
to
the
boat.
Any
of
you
boys
wanna
shoot,
Any
reason
one
of
us,
doesn't
wanna
But
this
is
what
we
do.
Who
we
are.
Live
for
nothing.
Or
die
for
something.
Your
call!

What's
your
call?
Once
Schoolboy's

And
