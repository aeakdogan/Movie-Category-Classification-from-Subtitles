My
lord,
I'll
tell
you.
That
same
bill
is
urged
which,
in
the
eleventh
year
was
likely
to
have
been
but
that
the
scambling
did
push
it
out
of
further
question.
But
how,
my
lord,
shall
we
resist
it
now?
It
must
be
thought
on.

the

half
for

temporal
lands

Church,

they
strip
from

-
-
This
would
drink
deep.
-

The
King
is
full
of
grace
and
fair
regard.
And
a
true
lover
of
the
holy
Church.
The
courses
of
his
youth
promised
it
not,
since
his
addiction
was
to
courses
vain,
his
companies
unlettered,
his
hours
filled
up
with
banquets,
and
never
noted
in
him
any
study.
And
so
the
prince
under
the
veil
of
wildness,
which
grew,
no
doubt,
-
fastest
by
night.
The
breath
no

-

"We
are
blessed
in
the
change"!
My
good
lord,
how
now
for
mitigation
Doth
his
majesty
incline
to
it,
or
no?
He
seems
indifferent,
for
I
have
made
an
offer
to
his
majesty,
as
touching
France,
to
give
a
greater
sum
the
clergy
yet
did
to
his
predecessors
How
did
this
offer
seem
received,
Of
good
acceptance
of
his
majesty,
save
that
there

which
I
could
with
a
ready
guess
declare
before
the
Frenchman
speak
a
word
of
it.
I'll
wait
upon
you
and
I
long
to
hear
it.





Where
is
my
gracious
-
Not

we
call

We
would

Sure,
we
thank
you.
My
learned
lord,
we
pray
you
to
proceed
and
justly
and
religiously
unfold
why
the

they
have
or

nor

not,
We
charge
you
in
the
name
of
God,
take
heed

For
never
two
such
kingdoms
did
contend

Then
hear
me,
gracious
sovereign,
that
owe
your
lives,
your
faith,
There
is
no
bar
to
make
but
this,
"In

No
woman
shall
succeed
in
Salic

-
which
Salic
land
the
French
unjustly
gloze
Yet
their
own
authors
faithfully
affirm
that
the
land
Salic
lies
in
Germany,
between
the
floods
of
Saale
and
of
Elbe,
where,
Charles
the
Great,
there
left

holding
in
disdain
for
some
dishonest
manners

...established
there
this
law

to

which
is
this

in
Germany
Then
doth
it
well
appear
the

the
French

that,

is

God
save

My

my
Jove,

I
know

not,
old
man.
Fall
to
thy
prayers.
How
ill
white
hairs
become
I
have
long
dreamed
of
so
surfeit-swelled,
But
being
awaked,
Reply
not
to
me
with
a
foolish
jest,
presume
not
that
I
am
the
thing
I
was.
For
God
doth
know,
that
I
have
turned
away
my
former
self,
so
shall
I
those
that
kept
me
company.
Prithee,
honey
sweet
husband,
No,
for
my
manly
heart
doth
yearn.
Bardolph,
be
blithe.
Boy,
bristle
thy
courage
up.
For
Falstaff
he
is
dead,
and
we
must
yearn
therefore.
Well,
Sir
John
is
gone,
God
be
with
him.
Would
I
were
with
him,
either
in
heaven
or
in
hell.
Nay,
he's
not
in
hell.
He's
in
Arthur's
bosom,
He
made
a
finer
end
and
went
away
He
parted
e'en
e'en
at
the
turning
of
the
tide.
When
I
saw
him
fumble
with
the
sheets,
play
with
flowers,
I
knew
there
was
no
way
but
one.
For
his
nose
was
as
sharp
as
a
pen.
And
he
babbled
of
green
fields.
"How
now,
Sir
John?"
quoth
I.
So
he
cried
out,
"Gone,
gone,
gone,"
Now
I,
to
comfort
him,
I
hoped
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
So
he
bade
me
lay
more
clothes
I
put
my
hand
in
the
bed
and
felt
them.
They
were
as
cold
as
any
stone.
Then
I
felt
to
his
knees
and
they
were
as
cold
as
any
stone.
And
so...
upwards...
and
upwards...
and
all
was
cold
as
any
stone.
They
say
he
cried
out
for
sack.
Ay,
he
did
that.
-
And
for
women.
-
That
he
did
not.
And
he
said
they
were
devils
incarnate.
He
said
once
the
devil
would
have
him
He
did
in
some
sort,
indeed,
but
then
he
was
rheumatic.
Do
you
not
remember,
and
said
it
was
a
black
soul
Well,
the
fuel
is
gone
That's
all
the
riches
I
got
in
his
service.
Shall
we
go?
The
King
will
be
gone
Come,
let
us
away.
My
love,
give
me
thy
lips.
Look
to
my
chattels
and
my
movables.
Go,
clear
thy
crystals.
Yoke-fellows
in
arms,
let
us
to
France.
Like
horse-leeches
my
boys,
Touch
her
soft
lips,
and
part.
Farewell,
hostess.
I
cannot
kiss,
that's
the
humour
of
it,
Let
housewifery
appear.
Farewell,
farewell,
divine
Zenocrate.

This

let
us
fear
the

mightiness...
and

of

Ambassadors
from
Harry,
do
crave
admittance
to
Your
Majesty.
We'll
give

audience.
Good
my
sovereign,
and
let
them
know
Self-love,
my
liege,
is
not
so
vile
a
sin

From
our
brother
England?
From
him,
He
wills
you,
that
you
divest
yourself
and
lay
apart
the
borrowed
glories
that
by
gift
of
'longs
to
him
and
to
his
heirs,
namely
the
crown.
Willing
you
over-look
this
pedigree,
and
when
you
find
him
evenly
derived
from
his
most
famed
of
famous
ancestors,
he
bids

from
him,
the
native

true
challenger.
If
not,
what
follows?
Bloody
constraint.
For
if
you

Therefore
in
fierce
tempest
is
he
coming,
in
thunder
and
in
earthquake
like
a
Jove,
that
if
requiring

he
will
compel.
This
is
his
claim,
his
threatening,
unless
the
Dauphin
be
in
presence
here,
to
whom
expressly
I
bring
greeting
too.
For
us,
we
will
consider
of
this
further.
Tomorrow
shall
you
bear
our
full
intent
For
the
Dauphin,
I
stand
here
for
him.
What
to
him
from
England?
Scorn
and
defiance,
and
anything
that
may
not
misbecome
Thus
says
my
King.
And
if
your
father's

not,
sweeten
the
bitter
mock

make

it.
Tomorrow
shall
you

Dispatch
us
with
all
speed,
lest
that
our
king
come
here
himself

Work,
work
your
thoughts,
and
therein
see
a
siege!
Behold
the
ordnance
on
their
carriages,
with
fatal
mouths
Once
more...
unto
the
breach,
or
close
the
wall
up
In
peace
as
modest
stillness
and
humility.
But
when
the
blast
of
war
then
imitate
the
action
of
the
tiger.
Stiffen
the
sinews,
disguise
fair
nature
Then
lend
the
eye
a
terrible
aspect,
let
it
pry
through
the
portage
of

Let
the

with

Now
set
the

and
bend
up
On,
on,
you
noblest
English,
whose
blood
is
fathers
that
like
so
many
Alexanders
have
in
these
parts
and
sheathed
their
swords
Dishonour
not
your
mothers.
Now
attest
that
those
whom
you
call
fathers
Be
copy
now
to
men
of
grosser
blood
and
teach
them
how
to
war.
And
you,
good
yeomen,
show
us
here
the
mettle
of
your
pasture.
Let
us
swear
that
which
I
doubt
not,
for
there
is
that
hath
not

lustre
in
your
eyes.
I
see
you
stand
like
greyhounds
The
game's
afoot.
Follow
your
spirit,
and
upon
this
charge
cry,
"God
for
Harry,

God
for
Harry,
God
for
Harry,

On,
on!
To
the
breach!
To
the...
Pray
thee
corporal,
stay.
Ah,
knocks,
they
come
and
go,
God's
vassals
drop
and
die,
and
sword
and
shield,
in
bloody
field,

'Tis
honour,
and
that's
the
truth
of
it.
Would
I
were
in
an
alehouse
in
London.
I'd
give
all
my
fame
for
a
pot
of
ale,
God's
plud!
Up
to
the
breach,
you
dogs!
Avaunt,
you
cullions!
Ah!
Ah!
Be
merciful,
great
duke,
Ah!
Abate
thy
rage,
abate
thy
manly
rage!

The
nimble
gunner
now
the
devilish
cannon
touches.
And
down
goes
all
before
it!
Captain
Fluellen!
Captain
Fluellen,
The
Duke
of
Gloucester

To
the
mines?
Tell
you
the
duke
For
look
you,
the
mines
is
not
according
to
The
concavities
of
it
is
not
sufficient.
For
look
you,
the
adversary,
you
may
is
digt
himself
I
think
he
will
blow
up
all
The
Duke
of
Gloucester,
is
altogether
directed
by
an
Irishman,
-
Mm.
It
is
Captain
Macmorris,
is
it
not?
By
Cheshu,
he
is
an
ass,
as
in
the
world.
He
has
no
more
directions
in
the
true
of
the
Roman
disciplines,
-

Here
he
comes.
And
the
Scots
captain,
Captain
Jamy,
Ah!
Captain
Jamy
is
a
marvellous,
of
great
expedition
and
knowledge
I
say
good
day,
Captain
Fluellen.
Good
e'en
to
your
worship,
Good
day.
Put
it
there.
Captain
Jamy
is
a
marvellous,
How
now,
Captain
Macmorris,
Have
the
pioneers
given
o'er?

O,
by
the
saints,
The
work
is
give
over,
By
my
hand,
I
swear,
The
work
is
give
over.
I
would
have
blowed
up
the
town,
Ah,
'tis
ill
done.
By
my
hand,
'tis
ill
done.
Captain
Macmorris,
I
beseech
you
now,
will
you
vouchsafe
me,
look
you,
Partly
to
satisfy
my
opinion
and
partly
for
the
satisfaction,
As
touching
the
direction
of
the
military
It
shall
be
very
good,
good
faith,
And
I
would
fain
hear
some
discourse
This
is
no
time
to
discourse,
No,
the
day
is
hot,
and
the
weather
and
This
is
no
time
to
discourse.
The
town
is
beseeched.
Ay,
the
trumpet
call
us
into
the
breach
and
we
talk
and,
by
the
Holy,
do
nothing!
'Tis
a
shame
for
us
all,
so
God
save
me.
'Tis
a
shame
to
stand
still.
'Tis
a
shame
by
my
hand.
And
there
is
throats
to
be
cut,
and
nothing
is
done,
save
me,
God.
By
the
mess,
ere
these
eyes
o'
mine
I'll
do
good
service,
or
I'll
lie
i'
the
ground
And
I'll
pay
it
as
valorously
as
I
may.
That
shall
I
surely
do.
Mm?
Captain
Macmorris,
I
think,
look
you,
there
is
not
many...
of
your
nation.
Of
my
nation?
What
is
my
nation?
Is
a
villain
and
bastard
What
is
my
nation?
Who
talks
of
my
nation?
Look
you,
if
you
take
the
matter
otherwise
peradventure
I
shall
think
as
in
discretion
you
ought
to
use
me,
being
as
good
a
man
as
yourself,
and
in
the
derivation
of
my
birth,
I
do
not
know
you
so
God
save
me,
Gentlemen
both,

That's
a
foul
fault.

-
The
town
sounds
a
parley!
How
yet
resolves
the
governor
This
is
the
latest
parley
we'll
admit.
Our
expectation
hath
this
day
an
end.
The

Therefore,

Enter

Open

Use

down
upon

in

chariot
into
Rouen
This
becomes
the
great.
Sorry
am
I
his
numbers
are
so
few,
his
soldiers
sick
and
famished
For
I
am
sure
he'll
drop
his
heart
into
the
sink
of
fear
and,
for
achievement,
Therefore,
Lord
Constable,
Prince
Dauphin,
-
Not
so,
I
do
beseech
Your
Majesty.
Now
forth,
Lord
Constable,
and
quickly
bring
us
word

You
know
me
by
my
habit.
Well
then,
I
know
thee.
-
My
master's
mind.
Thus
says
my
king,
"though
we
seemed
dead,
"Tell
him
we
could
have
rebuked
him
"but
we
thought
not
good
"Now
we

admire

him

"For
our

"For
the
effusion
of

"the

of

for

a
weak
and
worthless
satisfaction.

I

For
to

Go,
therefore,

There's

Mountjoy.
-
March
to

It
now
draws
toward

Beyond
the
river
we'll
encamp
ourselves.
And
on
the
morrow


Now

when
creeping
murmur
fills
the
wide
vessel
of
the
universe.
From

the
hum
of

sounds,
that
the
fixed
sentinels
almost
receive
the
secret
whispers
Fire
answers
fire,
and
through
their
paly
flames
each
battle
sees
Steed
threatens
steed,
piercing
the
night's
dull
ear.
And
from
the
tents
the
armourers,
with
busy
hammers
closing
rivets
up,
give
dreadful
note
of
preparation.
Proud
of

Tut,
I
have
the
best
armour
of
the

Would
it
were

You
have
an
excellent
armour,
It
is
the
best
horse
of
Europe.
Hm.
Will
it
never
be
morning?
My
Lord
of
Orlans,
you
talk
of
horse
and
armour?
You
are
as
well
provided
of
both
What
a
long
night
is
this.
I
will
not
change
my
horse
Ah
ha!
He
bounds
from
the
earth.
When
I
bestride
him,
I
soar,
I
am
a
hawk.
He
trots
the
air,
He
is
of
the
colour
of
nutmeg
He
is
pure
air
and
fire,
and
all
other
jades
you
may
call
beasts.
It
is
indeed,
my
lord,
It
is
the
prince
of
palfreys.
His
neigh
is
like
the
bidding
-
and
his
countenance
enforces
homage.
Nay,
cousin,
the
man
hath
no
wit
that
cannot
from
the
rising
of
the
lark
vary
deserved
praise
on
my
palfrey.
I
once
writ
a
sonnet
in
his
praise,
"Wonder
of
nature..."
Ahem.
I
have
heard
a
sonnet
begin
so
Then
did
they
imitate

Methought
yesterday
My
Lord
Constable,
the

are
those
stars
or
suns
upon
it?
-
Stars,
my
lord.
That
may
be.
Will
it
never
be
day?
I
will
trot
tomorrow
a
mile
and
my
way
Who
will
go
hazard
with
me

'Tis
midnight.
I'll
go
arm
myself.
The
Dauphin
longs
for
morning.
Hm.
He
longs
to
eat
the
English.
I
think
he
will
eat
all
he
kills.
Ho-ho,
he
never
did
harm
that
I
heard
of.
Nor
will
do
none
tomorrow.
I
know
him
to
be
valiant.
I
was
told
that
by
one
that
knows
him

What's
he?
And
he
said
he
cared
not

knew
it.

Alas,
poor
Harry

He
longs
not

we
do.
Huh.
What
a
wretched
and
peevish
fellow

popular?
I
am
a
gentleman
of
a
company.
Trail'st
thou
the
puissant
pike?
-
Even
so.
What
are
you?
-
Then
you
are
better
than
the
King.
The
King's
a
bawcock
a
lad
of
life,
an
imp
of
fame,
of
parents
good,
of
fist
most
valiant.
I
kiss
his
dirty
shoe,
and
from
heartstring
-
What
is
thy
name?
Leroi?
A
Cornish
name.
No,
I'm
a
Welshman.
-
Know'st
thou
Fluellen?
-
Art
thou
his
friend?
Well,
tell
him
I'll
knock
his
leek
Do
not
you
wear
your
dagger
in
your
cap
-
A
figo
for
thee,
then.
My
name
is
Pistol
called.
It
sorts
well
with
your
fierceness.
Captain
Fluellen?
-
Captain
Fluellen?
In
the
name
of
Beelzebub,
speak
lower.
If
you
will
take
the
pains
but
to
examine
you
shall
find,
I
warrant
you,
there
is
no
tittle-tattle
nor
pibble-pabble
I
warrant
you
shall
find
the
ceremonies
and
the
forms
of
it,
to
be
otherwise.
Why,
the
enemy
is
loud.
If
the
enemy
is
an
ass
is
it
meet,
think
you,
be
an
ass

and
a
fool
-
Shh.
I
will
speak
lower.
I
pray
you
and
beseech
you
that
you
will.

Though
it
appear
there
is
much
care
and
valour
Brother
John
Bates,
be
not
that
I
think
it
be.
But
we
have
no
great
cause
We
see
yonder
the
beginning
of
the
day,
but
I
think
we
shall
never
see
Who
goes
there?
A
friend.
Under
what
captain
serve
you?
Under...
Sir
Thomas
Erpingham.
Oh.
A
good
old
commander
I
pray
you,
what
thinks
he
of
our
estate?
Even
as
men
wrecked
upon
a
sand,
that
look
to
be
washed
off
the
next
tide.
He
hath
not
told
his
thought
to
the
King?
No.
Nor
it
is
not
meet
he
should.
For
I
think
the
King
is
but
a
man,
as
I
am.
The
violet
smells
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me.
His
ceremonies
laid
by,
Therefore,
when
he
sees
his
fears,
without
doubt,
Yet
no
man
should
find
in
him
lest
he,
by
showing
it,
He
may
show
what
outward
courage
he
will,
he'd
wish
himself
in
Thames
So
I
would
he
were,
and
I
by
him,
By
my
troth,
I
will
speak
I
think
he
would
not
wish
himself
Then
I
would
he
were
here
alone.
So
should
he
be
sure
to
be
ransomed,
Methinks...
I
would
not
die
anywhere
his
cause
being
just
It's
more
than
we
know.
Ay.
Or
more
than
we
should
seek
after.
For
we
know
enough
If
his
cause
be
wrong,
our
obedience
to
the
King
But
if
the
cause
be
not
good,
the
King
himself
when
all
those
legs
and
arms
shall
join
together
at
the
latter
day,
and
cry
all,
"We
died
at
such
a
place,"
some
swearing,
some
upon
their
wives
some
upon
the
debts
they
owe,
some
upon
their
children
rawly
left.
I'm
afraid
there
are
few
die
well
for
how
can
they
charitably
when
blood
is
their
argument?
Now,
if
these
men
do
not
die
well,
it'll
be
a
black
matter
Ay.
So,
if
a
son
that
is
by
his
father
do
sinfully
miscarry
upon
the
sea,
the
imputation
of
his
wickedness,
should
be
imposed
upon
his
father,
But
this
is
not
so.
The
King
is
not
bound
to
answer
for
nor
the
father
of
his
son,
for
they
purpose
not
their
deaths
Every
subject's
duty
is
the
King's,
but
every
subject's
soul
is
his
own.
'Tis
certain.
Every
man
that
dies
ill,
The
King's
not
to
answer
for
it.
I
do
not
desire
he
should
answer
for
me,
and
yet
I
determine
to
fight
lustily
I
myself
heard
the
King
say

He
said
so
for
when
our
throats
are
cut,
he
If
ever
I
live
to
see
it,

That's
a
perilous
shot
out
of
a
pop-gun,
that
a
poor
and
private
displeasure
You
may
as
well
with
fanning
in
its
face
You'll
never
trust
his
word
after.
-
Come,
'tis
a
foolish
saying.
I
should
be
angry
with
you
Let
it
be
a
quarrel
between
us,
then,
-

We
have
French
quarrels
enough

Never
trust
in
his
word,
I
say.

Upon
the
King.
Let
us
our
lives,
our
souls,
our
debts,
our
careful
wives,
our
children...
and
our
sins
lay
on
the
King.
We
must
bear
all.
What
infinite
heartsease
that
private
men
enjoy?
And
what
have
kings
save
ceremony?
And
what
art
thou,
thou
idol
ceremony,
that
sufferest
more
of
mortal
griefs
than
do
thy
worshippers?
What
drink'st
thou
oft,
but
poisoned
flattery?
O
be
sick,
great
greatness,
Canst
thou,

thou
command'st

the
health
of

No,

that
I
am

not
the

sits
on,

the

of

that
Not

Nay,
that's
right.
Saint
Davy's
day
is
past.
There
is
occasions
and
causes
why
and
I
will
tell
you,
as
my
friend,
The
rascally,
beggarly,
which
you
and
yourself
and
all
the
world
know
to
be
no
better
than
a
fellow,
he
is

to
me
and
bring
me
and

me
eat

leek.

was
in
a
place
where
I
could
not
breed

I
will
be
so
bold
as
wear
it

then
I
will

rogue,

what
such
as
the
camp
can
do

bottles
is
wonderful
to
be
thought
of.

he
comes,

of

up

she

all
her

doth
lie
on
heaps,
corrupting
in
its
own
fertility.
Her
vine,
the
merry
cheerer
of
the

unpruned,
dies.
Her

even-pleached,

fallow
leas,
doth
root

should

savagery.

all
uncorrected,

conceives
by
idleness,

nothing
teems

hateful

rough
thistles,
kecksies,
burs,
losing
both
beauty
and
utility.

so

lost,

do

grow
like

as

that

unnatural.

demands.
I
have
but
with
a
cursory
eye
Pleaseth
your
grace
to
appoint
some
We
will
suddenly

our

Brother,
we
shall.
Will
you,
fair
sister,
go
with
the
princes...
or
stay
here
with
us?
Our
gracious
brother,
I
will
go
with
them.
Haply,
a
woman's
voice
when
articles
too
nicely
urged
be
stood
on.
Yet
leave
our
cousin
Katherine
She
hath
good
leave.

Fair
Katherine,
and
most
fair...
will
you
vouchsafe
to
teach
a
soldier
and
plead
his
love-suit
Your
Majesty
shall
mock
at
me.
I
cannot
speak
your
England.
O
fair
Katherine,
if
you
will
love
me
soundly
I
will
be
glad
to
hear
you
confess
it
Do
you...
like
me,
Kate?
Pardonnez-moi?
I
cannot
tell
what
is..."like
me".
An
angel
is
like
you,
Kate.
Que
dit-il?
Oui,
vraiment,
sauf
votre
grce,
O
bon
Dieu.
Les
langues
des

What
says
she,
fair
one?
That
Oui,
that

tongues

de
mens

I'
faith,
Kate,
I
am
glad
For
if
thou
couldst,
that
thou
wouldst
think
I
know
no
ways
to
mince
it
in
love,
but
directly
to
say..."I
love
you."
and
so
clap
hands
and
a
bargain.
Sauf
votre
honneur,
me
understand
well.
Marry,
if
you
put
me
to
verses,
why,
you
undo
me.
If
I
might
buffet
for
my
love,
I
could
lay
on
like
a
butcher,
But
before
God,
Kate,
I
cannot
look
greenly,
nor
have
I
no
cunning
in
protestation.
If
thou
canst
love
that
never
looks
in
his
glass
whose
face
is
not
worth
sunburning...
If
not,
to
say
to
thee
But,
for
thy
love,
by
the
Lord,
no.
Yet
I
love
thee,
too.
And
while
thou
livest,
dear
Kate,
take
a
fellow
of
plain
constancy,
for
these
fellows
of
infinite
tongue
that
can
rhyme
themselves
they
do
always
reason
themselves
A
speaker
is
but
a
prater,
A
straight
back
will
stoop,
a
fair
face
will
wither,
but
a
good
heart,
Kate,
If
thou
wouldst
have
such
a
one,
take
me.
And
take
me,
take
a
soldier.
Take
a
soldier,
take
a
king.
And
what
sayest
thou
then
to
my
love?
Speak,
my
fair,
and
fairly,
I
pray
thee.
Is
it
possible
No,
Kate,
but
in
loving
me
for
I
love
France
so
well

And
Kate,
when
France
is
mine,
then
yours
is
France,
and
you
are
mine.
I...
cannot
tell
what
is
dat.
No,
Kate?
I
will
tell
thee
in
French,
which
I
like
a
newly
married
wife
about
her
Er...

et
quand

I
shall
never

it's
not,
Kate.

needs
be
granted
to
be
much
alike.
But,
Kate,
dost
thou
understand
Canst
thou...
love
me?
I
cannot
tell.
Can
any
of
your
neighbours
tell,
Kate?
Come,
I
know
thou
lovest
me.
And
at
night,
when
you
are
come
into
your
you
will
question
this
gentlewoman
and
I
know,
Kate,
you
will
to
her
which
you
love
with
your
heart.
But,
good
Kate,
mock
me
mercifully
-
the
rather,
gentle
princess,
What
sayest
thou,
La
plus
belle
Katherine
du

et

enough
to
deceive

sage
demoiselle
Now
fie
upon
my
false
French
but,
by
mine
honour,
in
true
English,
By
which
honour,
yet
my
blood
begins
Put
off
your
maiden
blushes.
Avouch
the
thoughts
of
your
heart
Take
me
by
the
hand
and
say,
which
word
thou
shalt
no
sooner
bless
"England
is
thine,
Ireland
is
thine,
"and
Henry
Plantagenet
is
thine."
Therefore,
queen
of
all,
Katherine,
wilt
thou
have
me?
Dat
is
as
it
shall
please
de
roi
mon

Nay,
it
shall
please
him
well,
Kate.
It
shall
please
him,
Kate.
Den
it
shall
also
content
me.
Upon
that
I
kiss
your
hand

Laissez,
mon
seigneur,
Ma
foi,
je
ne
peut
en
baisant
la
main
Excusez-moi,
je
vous
supplie,
Oh.
-
Then
I
will
kiss
your
lips,
Kate.
Les

et

n'est

en

Madam
my
interpreter,
what
says
she?
That
it
is
not
the
fashion
Oh...
-
I
cannot
tell
what
is
"baiser"
in
English.
Votre
majest
entend
bettre
que
moi.
It
is
not
the
fashion
for
the
maids
to
kiss
before
they
are
married,
Oui,
vraiment.
O
Kate...
nice
customs
courtesy
to
great
kings.
Dear
Kate,
you
and
I
cannot
be
confined
within
the
weak
list
We
are
the
makers
of
manners,
Kate.
Therefore,
patiently...
and
yielding...
You
have
witchcraft
in
your
lips...
Kate.
God
save
Your
Majesty.
My
royal
cousin,

I
would
have
her
learn,
my
fair
cousin,
and
that
is
good
English.
Shall
Kate
be
my
wife?
Take
her,
fair
son,
that
the
contending
kingdoms
whose
very
shores
look
pale
with
envy
may
cease
their
hatred
and
'twixt
England
and
fair
France.

Amen.

Small

for
his
