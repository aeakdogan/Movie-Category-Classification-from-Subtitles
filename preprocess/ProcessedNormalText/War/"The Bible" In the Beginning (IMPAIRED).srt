Another
one!


In
the
beginning,
God
created
The
earth
was
a
formless
void,
and
darkness
covered
And
God
said,
and
there
was
light.
On
the
second
day
to
form
the
seas
and
the
sky.



On
the
third
day
...with
trees
and
plants
Will
we
ever
see
land
again?
Of
course.
Of
course
we
will.
The
next
day
and
the
stars
in
the
heavens.
And
on
the
fifth
day,
all
the
creatures
of
the
sea...
...and
of
the
air.
And
on
the
sixth
day

And
then
he
made
us.
To
live
in
paradise.
Until...
Adam
and
Eve
disobeyed
God
and
ate
the
forbidden
fruit.
And
with
one
choice,
they
learned
both
good
and
evil.
Since
then,
God
has
seen
too
much
evil

Wrong
choices,
wrong
decisions.
That's
why
this
is
happening.
Our
creator
decided
God
warned
me.
A
boat
to
save
our
family,
Every
other
living
creature...
Would
die.


And
on
the
seventh
day,
God...
Rested.
After
the
floodwater's
there
is
a
new
beginning
and
a
chance
to
restore
between
God
and
humanity.
This
is
the
Bible.
Lord!

It
has
begun.
What
are
we
going
to
do?
Change
the
world.
A
nation
and
a
people
in
an
all-powerful
creator.

and
he
is
in
heaven.
You
only
have
one
teacher,
Their
story
If
you
hunger
for
righteousness,
then
you
will
be
filled
The
choices
we
make.
Whoever
believes
in
me
How
we
live

Blessed
are
the
poor,
for
theirs
is
Ho
how
we
love.

Blessed
are
the
meek,
for
they
shall
How
we
struggle
and
overcome.

There
will
be
or
crying
or
pain.
I
am
coming
soon.
Before
billions
one
man
must
hear
God's
voice
Abraham,
leave
your
home
and
go
to
the
land
and
your
offspring.
I
will
bless
you.
I
will
make
you
a
father
with
descendants
All
the
peoples
on
earth
Sarah.
God
has
spoken
to
me.
Come

Lot,
my
nephew,

Abraham?
God
has
spoken
to
me.
He
will
lead
us
to
a
new
home.
But
we
have
a
home,
Away
from
the
city
For
our
children.
But
you

no
children.

But
we
will.
He
has
promised
descendants

spoke
to
me.
He
promised.

me.
Believe
me.

And,
lot,
you
are
with
me?
He
will
lead
us
No.
No.

Such
wonder!
Driven
by
the
belief
that
Abraham
leads
his
small
tribe
to
the
land
What
else
can
I
do?
You
can't
have
mine!

Calm
down!
Stop!
Come
away!
This
can't
go
on.
You've
got
What's
going
on?

men
are

us
this
land
to
share.
Then

should
have
Tell
him.
Abraham,
there
just
There
are
too
many
of
us.
The
Lord
will
provide.
In
a
God
we
cannot
see?
It's
time
we
go
No.
No,
we
must
stay
together.
Stay
and
starve?
Stay
and
watch
our
men
over
a
blade
of
grass?
Uncle.
We're
leaving.
Very
well.
Where
do
you
want
to
go?
To
the
greener
pastures

Sodom?
They
are

lands.
Take

Help
him.
Here,

my
hand.
Lean
on
me.
That's
better.
Tend
to
him.
We
have
some
trained
men.
Abraham,
you
are
not
soldiers.
I
told
them
to
trust
in
God.
And
then
they
left
us.
They
had
their
pick
of
They
are

We
have
to
help
them.
God
will
take

of
us.

Lot,
many
men
have
I've
lost
men
too.
We
must
stay
together.
No.
No,
Uncle.
We
can't.
The
future
is
in
the
city.
Come

to
carry
on.
Let's

means
laughter.
Thank

for
your
hospitality.
We
must

Moses.
You're

fight
again.
I
can't
refuse.
The
fighting
between

Moses
doesn't
want
to
fight.
It's
your
son
who
forces
him

You
may
be
my
sister's
favorite,
but
I
will
be
Pharaoh.
I
will
be
God!
Please.
Fight
me!
I
order
you!
Moses!
Enough!


He
needs
to
learn
his
place!
But

be
Pharaoh!
Then
you'd
better
start
This
is
your
fault.
You
should

Silence.
-
You're
not
one
of
us!
What's
he
talking
about?
You'd
better
tell
him
now.
You!
Come
with
me!
Mother.
Tell
me
what?
What?!
Moses.
I
love
you
like
a
son.
But
you're
not
my
blood!
You
were
born
a
slave.
Fetch
them
all!


Father
killed
He
feared
a
rebellion.
Your
people
were
too
many.
My...
People?
I
saved
you.

Your
people
are
Our
slaves.
The
Israelites.
You
had
a
brother,
Aaron.
And
a
sister.
Miriam.
But
they
are
not
like
us.
Come
on!
You!
Come
on!
Come
on,
up

They
worship
and

has
deserted
them.

Israelite
scum!
No,

Please!
I

you!
Jump!
Run,

I
will
hide
the

My
Lord,
the
amulet

Shall
we
hunt
him
down?
No,
let
him
go.
He's
no
threat
now.
Welcome
to
your
new
life,
You
are
nothing
now!
Nothing.


Your
people

You're
not
one
of

I
am
here.
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham,
You
are
real?
I
am.
I
have
seen
I
am
sending
you
to
Pharaoh
But
how
can
I
set
them
free?
I
will
be
with
you.
With
your
power,
In
Egypt,
there
is
Moses's
old
rival
Thank
you,
father.
One
day
you'll
have


Come
on!

Nothing
has
changed.
Hey,
you!
Hey,
you!
Back
to
work!
Wait.
Wait.
Please.
I'll
take
care
of
him,
master.
What
are
you
doing?
Trying
Who
are
you?
My
name
is
Moses.
Moses?
You
are
Moses?
I
need
to
see
your
elders.
Come
with
me.
This
man
says
he's
Moses!

The
runaway
prince.
You're
wanted
for
murder.
If
you're
who
you
say
you
are,
God
has
sent
me.
I
am
here
to
set
you
free.

God
has
sent
you?
Yes,
God
sent
me.
Have
you
forgotten
God?
Even
if
you
have...
He
has
not
forgotten
you.

In
case
you
had
forgotten,
Pharaoh
is
the
only
God
And
you
think
Who
created
the
earth,
sea,
sky?
Who
created
you?
Pharaoh?
Or
God?
You're
demented.

No!
He
isn't!

He's
my
brother.
Aaron.
Moses!
God
sent
me
a
dream
This
is
Miriam,
your
sister.
Brother.
My
children.
My
family.
My
people.
Our
people.
-
God's
people!
Old
Pharaoh
may
have
But
it's
his
son
Why
would
Pharaoh
even
see
you?
Oh...
He'll
want
to
see
me.
You
have
a
son.
An
heir.
Our
dynasty
Why
are
you
here,
Moses?
Have
you
come
to
ask
No.
No.
God
saved
me
for
a
purpose.
Yes?
I
come
to
demand
that
you
release
his
people
Demand?
Let
my
people
go.

You
always
But
you
never
knew
If
you
defy
God,
You
return,
after
all
these
Tell
me.
Is
it
your
invisible
God
The
one
who
abandons
The
one
who
runs
from
his
past?
From
his
family?
Teach
them
who
God
is.
I
am
God!
I
am
God!
Moses!
You've
made
He
will
punish
us.
God
has
spoken
to
me.
He
will
force
Pharaoh
If
he
has
to.
What
should
we
do?
Sister.
Brother.
All
of
you.
Trust
in
God!
Pharaoh
is
over
there.
If
he
didn't
listen
to
you
why
would
he
hear
you
now?
You
will
see.
Put
your
staff...
To
the
water.

Master!
Come
out
of
the
water!
There's
blood!
Blood
everywhere!
-
Your
majesty!
Master!
You
are
not
a
God.
You
are
just
a
man.
And
you
will
set
my
people
free.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Move
away!
Moses!


Do
you
doubt,
Joshua?
All
my
life,
I
will
never
be
a
slave
again.
God
is
with
us.
This
is
just
the
beginning.

Our
Lord
to
change
Pharaoh's
mind.
Let
my
people
go.
No!
No!
No!
Locusts.
Come
away!
Master!
No!




Moses?
What
is
Pharaoh's
answer?
No.
He
refuses.
Again?
Give
up,
Moses,
God
will
keep
on
doing
this
until
Pharaoh
breaks.
What's
wrong?
Soon
there
will
be
The
angel
of
death
is
coming.
Every
firstborn
son
will
die.
No.
Please.
But
not
us?
Death
is
coming
for
us
all.

Why
us?

The
angel
of
death
is
coming.
Every
firstborn
son
will
die.
No,
please.
But
not
us?
Death
is
coming
for
us
all.

Why
us?
Friends!
We
can
be
spared
but
only
if
we
do
Don't
spill!
Every
single
house
must
The
Israelites
paint
lamb's
identifying
them
We
promised
God
would
but
now
he
sends
us
death.
We
must
trust
in
him.

It's
coming.
-
Will
we
be
safe?
God
have
mercy.

Whatever
happens
to
his
people
Once
I
counted
them
Our
freedom
comes
at
a
price.

The
angel
of
death
finds
every
israelite
house
and
passes
over.


Why?
Why?
Why
should
israelite
slaves
when
my
son
is
dead?
Get
up.
Get
up!
Go!
And
leave
my
land,
and
take

Load

do
it.

My
son.
How
could
slaves
do
this?
I
vow
to
you,
here
and
now,
that
I
will
bring
and
make
them
build
you
the
greatest
tomb
And
Moses's
body...
Shall
be
buried
This
is
the
exodus.
After
400
years
of
slavery,
I
still
can't
believe
-
But
he
did.
And
only
a
madman
would
defy

Brother?
What
now?
Brother?
God
will
provide
a
way.
Moses.
Why
have
you
God
brought
us
here.
And

God
say

the
hill.

have
them!
They're
trapped!
Die!
Horses!
Chariots!
They're
here!
The
Egyptians.
Fool!
What
do
we
do
now?
Or
is
it
because
there
that
you
brought
us
here
to
die?
Because
that
is

They're
coming!

Well?
Moses?

I
cannot
believe
this
is

our
door.

You
are
not
a
God,
Pharaoh.
There
is
only
one
God...
And
he
is
here
with
us.

No!
No!
Moses.
Moses!


Freedom!

My
friends!
My...
People.
God
has
delivered
us
We
are
free.
You
have
come
a
long
way.
I
know.
But
our
journey
We
must
trust
in
God.
We
must
follow
his
path.
Moses
leads
the
Israelites
where
God
first
spoke
to
him




Aah!
God
gives
laws
to
Moses,
The
ten
commandments.

Joshua.
God
has...
Renewed
the
promise
We
have
new
laws,
preparing
If
we
are
true
to
God,
Abraham's
dream.
Our
future.
You
are
our
people's
future,
You
must
take
the
land
and
all
of
his
descendants,
as
numerous
as
the
stars.

Lord,
I
was
with
Moses
when
he
I
was
witness
to
the
covenant,
the
promise
of
a
holy
nation.
Help
me
to
forge
that
nation,
to
lead
your
people

Joshua!

Joshua!
The
Lord
brought
us

Aye.
He
promised
us
this
land.

And
soon...
It
will
be
ours!
Come.
Are
you
ready?
We'll
search
the
whole
city.
Just
find
me
a
way
in.
It's
all
that
stands
between

Hey,
hey!
Only
collect
water
in
daylight.
-
Please.
The
Israelites
can
attack
Rahab.
My
little
whore.
Oh!
What
are
you
doing
out,
hm?
-
You
know
it's
not
safe?
-
Oh!
I
can
look
after
myself.

Go
home.



Shh.
What
are
you
men
doing
here?
Israelites!
Brother.
-
For
Israel!
-
The
enemy
are
in!
Sound
the
alarm!
It
has
begun.

The
Lord
parted
For
you
he
will
split
rock.
If
we
obey
the
Lord,
anything
is
possible!
Saul,
I
anoint
you
God
is
with
me!
Samson,
your
strength
Your
duty
is
to
drive

David,
the
people
to
defend
them,
unite
them.
Jerusalem,
our
new
home.

When
you
have
my
crown,
will
you
not
kill
Wherever
you
go
What
the
Lord
gives
What
is
your
name?
My
name
is
Delilah.
Your
God
has
abandoned
you,
And
taken
your
strength
No,
he
wants
me
The
Lord
told
me
will
rule
Israel
forever.
Israel!
There
will
be
no
more
death,
or
mourning,
or
crying,
or
pain.
