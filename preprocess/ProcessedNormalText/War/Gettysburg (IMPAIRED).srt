NARRATOR:
In
June
1863,
after
more
…
the
Confederate
army
of
Northern
…
slips
across
the
Potomac
It
is
an
army
of
70,000
men.
They
move
slowly
behind
the
Blue
Ridge…
…
using
the
mountains
Their
objective
is
to
draw
…
where
it
can
be
destroyed.
Late
in
June,
the
Union
army
…
turns
north
from
Virginia
to
begin
…
across
Maryland
and
into
Pennsylvania.
General
Lee
knows
that
a
letter
has
been
A
letter
which
offers
peace.
It
is
to
be
placed
on
the
desk
…
the
day
after
Lee
has
destroyed
…
somewhere
north
of
Washington.

Federal
cavalry.
Two
brigades.
Howdy,
friend.
Where
you
headed?
-
General
Longstreet.
I
must
see
him.
I
know
General
Lee's
headquarters
Wherever
he
is,
Longstreet
is
nearby.
-
Take
me
that
way.
It's
urgent.
You're
not
in
a
uniform
I'll
take
you
up
there,
…
I
guess,
unfortunately,

Sir.
General,
sir.
I'm
sorry,
excuse
me,
sir,
-
Harrison?
The
scout,
Harrison,
sir.
I
knew
you'd
want
to
know
that
He's
right
outside
here,
sir.
HARRISON:
Didn't
expect
to
see
me,
did
you?
I
paid
you
in
gold
three
weeks
ago.
I
don't
suppose
you
got
That
good
southern
tobacco.
What
do
you
got?
I
got
the
position
of
the
Yankee
army.
The
whole
Yankee
army
coming
this
way.
A
few
miles?
HARRISON:
Yes.
Two
brigades
…
two,
four
hours
away.
Behind
that
there's
seven
corps.
I
put
it
all
on
a
map,
if
you'd
like
to
see
it.
All
seven
corps.
HARRISON:
You
didn't
know
they
were
on
the
move.
You
wouldn't
be
spread
so
thin
How
do
you
know
we're
spread
out?
Listen,
general.
I'm
good
at
this
business.
Sir,
I
beg
your
pardon,
…
why
haven't
we
heard
about
it?
General
Stuart's
cavalry
is
out
there.
-
What
do
you
know
about
Jeb
Stuart?
He's
riding
up
north
somewhere
He
hasn't
caused
anything
If
the
Federal
army
was
moving
that
fast,
-
…
I
believe
General
Stuart—
I
came
within
an
angry
mule's
kick
And
all
the
way
through
a
picket
line.
Hazardous
too.
I
don't
know
what
Jeb
Stuart's
doing.
I
don't
care.
I
do
my
job.
Yankee
cavalry's
down
the
road,
…
not
two
hours
hard
ride
And
that,
by
God,
is
the
Lord's
truth.
-
Major
Sorrel.
Will
you
go
to
General
Lee's
headquarters
Yes,
sir.
-
Captain
Goree.
Get
this
man
a
tent.
And
a
cigar.
GOREE:
LONGSTREET:
He
says
the
lead
…
the
Sixth
right
behind…
…
supported
by
Seven
corps
all
together.
The
First
and
Eleventh
And
there's
more
cavalry
two
hours
east.
There
may
be
as
many
Do
you
believe
the
man,
No
choice.
You
remember
him,
sir,
An
actor?
Can't
afford
not
to.
LEE:
There
would
be
some
word
General
Stuart
would
not
leave
us
blind.
Oh.
One
other
thing.
George
Meade's
the
new
commander.
George
Meade,
Pennsylvania
man.
Meade
would
be
cautious,
I
think.
Take
him
some
time
to
get
organized.
Perhaps
we
should
move
more
swiftly.
There
may
be
an
opportunity
here.
Yes,
sir.
LEE:
I
think
we
should
concentrate
here.
All
the
roads
converge
-
This
junction
will
be
necessary.
I
left
my
spectacles
over
there.
LONGSTREET:
Gettysburg.
SCOUT:
KILRAIN:
Colonel,
darling.
Rise
up,
me
bucko.
I'm
sorry,
darling,
Would
you
like
to
hear
about
it?
Would
you
wake
up,
sir?
We
got
a
whole
company
coming,
sir.
This
way.
I'll
give
you
time
to
wake
up,
Altogether,
120
men
are
coming.
What?
Should
be
here
any
minute.
-
Who?
Mutineers,
colonel,
me
lad.
A
hundred
and
twenty
men
from
the
old

A
hundred
and
twenty
mutineers?
KILRAIN:
You
see,
what
happened
was
…
on
the
old
Second
Maine
run
out.
They
were
sent
home,
…
who
foolishly
signed
three-year
papers.
Three
years,
that
is.
So
these
poor
fellows
Only
they
thought
they
were
signing
…
and
the
Second
Maine
only.
So
they,
uh,
quit.
They
resigned,
you
see.
120
men.

-
Colonel,
are
you
all
right?
The
point
is,
Nobody
can
send
them
home
Until
they
thought
of
us…
…
being
as
we
are
the
only
other
So
they've
been
assigned
to
us.
Yes,
sir.
I
have
a
message
here
George
Meade,
sir.
That's
right.
Our
very
own
general
…
has
been
promoted
The
latest,
if
you
keep
track
of
them
The
message
says
they'll
be
arriving
Oh.
"And
if
they
refuse
to
follow
orders,
-
To
shoot
them?
-
These
Maine
men?

"You
are
hereby
authorized
to
shoot
Are
these
all
Maine
men?
Yes,
sir.

Mutiny.
I
thought
that
was

LEE:
It's
a
good
time
of
the
day.
I
always
do
enjoy
this
time,
When
all
this
is
over,
Sir?
I
didn't
mean
the
fighting.
Well…
…
it's
all
in
God's
hands
now.
Good
day,
sir.
Good
day
to
you.
SORREL:
Should
I
wake
them
up,
sir?
Should
I
No,
Moxley.
Let
the
boys
sleep
a
little
longer.
Yes,
sir.
SOLDIER:
How
many
men
do
we
have
now
Somewhere
around
250,
sir,
How
the
heck
are
we
supposed
Colonel,
it's
going
to
be
a
hot
day
today.
Seeing
as
you
already
been
down
…
that
the
good
Lord
provided,
You
walked.
Darling,
I've
been
in
the
infantry
After
the
first
few
thousand
miles,
Morning,
Lawrence.
How
are
you?
Darn
it,
Tom.
Don't
call
me
Lawrence.
It
doesn't
make
sense.
Hold
a
gun
on
a
man
to
get
him
to
fight.
BREWER:
Attention,
detail!
GUARD:
You
heard
the
captain.
BREWER:
Guards,
get
these
men
back

I'm
looking
You
found
him.
TOM:
That's
him.
Colonel
Chamberlain
to
you.
Captain
Brewer,
sir.
118th
Pennsylvania.
If
you're
the
commanding
officer,
You're
welcome
to
them.
Lord
knows,
I
had
to
use
the
bayonet
You
have
to
sign
for
them.
Sign
it,
lieutenant.
You
are
relieved,
captain.
You
are
authorized
to
use
You
want
to
shoot
them…
…
go
right
ahead.
Won't
nobody
say
nothing.
I
said
you
are
relieved,
captain.
You
men
can
leave
now.
My
name
is
Chamberlain.
When
did
you
have
something
to
eat?
They're
trying
to
break
us
We
ain't
broke
yet.
They
just
told
me
you
were
coming
I'll
get
the
cook
going.
The
meat
may
be
raw,
We've
got
quite
a
ways
to
go
today.
We'll
set
you
up
in
those
trees.
TOZIER:
Well.
You
boys
go
eat,
then
I'll
come
over
Colonel.
Colonel,
we've
got
grievances.
The
men
elected
me
to
talk
for
them.
All
right.
You
come
along
with
me.
The
rest
of
you
boys
go
eat.
TOZIER:
-
Gosh,
Lawrence.
-
Are
they
moving?
TOZIER:
LAWRENCE:
I
don't
feel
too
kindly,
colonel.
LAWRENCE:
Yes,
well,
I
just
took
command
Somebody
ought
to
welcome
you
They
tell
me
they're
holding
you
fellows
I'm
sorry.
Would
you
like
some
coffee?
Are
you
sure?
-
Go
ahead.
Sit
down,
Mister…
Joseph
Bucklin.
Listen,
Colonel.
How
many
have
you
been
in?
Not
that
many.
It
ain't
the
papers.
I
done
my
share.
We
all
have.
Damn
good
men.
Look
here.
It
went
clean
through.
Colonel,
we
got
a
courier
coming.
Listen,
colonel.
I'm
tired.
You
know
what
I
mean?
I'm
tired.
I've
had
all
this
army,
all
these
officers…
All
of
them.
The
whole
bloody,
lousy
mess
They
ain't
fit
to
lead
a
johnny
detail.
They
ain't
fit
to
pour
pee
out
of
a
boot
I'm
tired.
We
are
good
men
These
damn
idiots
used
us
We
ain't
gonna
win
this
war.
We
can't
win
with
these
These
damn
gentlemen.
These
officers!
KILRAIN:
Don't
go
away.
Colonel
Chamberlain,
sir.
Colonel
Vincent
wishes
to
inform
you
You
and
the
20th
Maine
Regiment
20th
Maine's
assigned
first
position
in
line.
LAWRENCE:
Flankers?
LAWRENCE:
Right,
yes.
Captain
Clark,
you
heard
him.
Sound
the
assembly.
Strike
the
tents.
You
better
get
something
to
eat.
Tell
your
men
I'm
coming.
The
boys
from
the
Second
Maine
Don't
call
me
Lawrence.
Damn
it,
Lawrence.
I'm
your
brother.
Be
careful
about
the
name
business
Because
we're
brothers,
General
Meade
got
his
own
son
That's
different.
Nothing
quite
so
much
like
God
on
earth
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
them?
You
can't
shoot
them.
I
know
that.
I
wonder
if
they
do.
Colonel,
sir.
You
know
who
this
man
is?
Dan
Burns,
from
Orono.
Best
cusser
I
ever
heard.
Knows
more
fine
swear
words
LAWRENCE:
I've
been
talking
with
Private
Bucklin.
There's
nothing
I
can
do
today.
We're
moving
out
in
a
few
minutes.
I've
been
ordered
I'm
told
that…
…
if
you
don't
come,
I
can
shoot
you.
Well,
you
know
I
won't
do
that.
Maybe
somebody
else
will,
but
I
won't.
So
that's
that.
Here's
the,
uh,
situation.
The
whole
reb
army
is
up
that
road
This
is
no
time
for
an
argument.
I
tell
you,
We're
now
well
below
half
strength.
Whether
you
fight
or
not,
Whether
you
come
along
is…
You
know
who
we
are,
If
you
fight
alongside
us,
This
regiment
was
formed
There
were
1,000
of
us
then.
There
are
less
than
300
of
us
now.
All
of
us
volunteered
to
fight
Some
came
mainly
because
Thought
this
looked
like
it
might
be
fun.
Some
came
because
Many
of
us
came
And
all
of
us
have
seen
men
die.
This
is
a
different
kind
of
army.
If
you
look
back
through
history,
…
for
women,
for
some
other
kind
of
loot.
They
fight
for
land,
power.
Because
a
king
leads
them,
We
are
here
for
something
new.
This
has
not
happened
much
We
are
an
army
out
to
set
other
men
free.
America
should
be
free
ground.
All
of
it.
Not
divided
by
a
line
All
the
way
from
here
No
man
has
to
bow.
No
man
born
to
royalty.
Here
we
judge
you
by
what
you
do,
Here
you
can
be
something.
Here
is
the
place
to
build
a
home.
But
it's
not
the
land.
There's
always
more
land.
It's
the
idea
that
we
all
have
value.
You
and
me.
What
we're
fighting
for,
in
the
end…
…
we're
fighting
for
each
other.
Sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to
preach.
You
go
ahead.
You
talk
for
a
while.
If
you
choose
to
join
us
and
want
Nothing
more
will
be
said
If
you
choose
not
to
join
us,
When
this
is
over,
I'll
do
what
I
can…
…
to
see
you
get
a
fair
treatment,
Gentlemen.
I
think
if
we
lose
this
fight…
…
we
lose
the
war.
So,
if
you
choose
to
join
us,


SPEAR:
-
Captain,
are
we
ready?
Then
let's
move
out.
20th
Maine!
Forward!

March!


GAMBLE:
At
least
a
whole
brigade.
BUFORD:
Not
a
lick,
sir.
That's
strange.
Infantry
moving
alone
Very
strange,
sir.
What
do
you
make
of
that?
He's
headed
this
way.
Sir?
Lee's
turned.
That's
the
main
body.
You
think
so?
-
I
thought
they
were
going
to
Harrisburg.
That's
too
many
troops
There's
power
behind
it.
Sir,
if
you
want
to
fight
here,
It's
the
best
damn
ground
It
is
that.
BUFORD:
We'll
move
both
brigades
That'll
make
the
good
citizens
happy.
Let's
go
down
and
have
a
look.
Sir.


-
Soldier,
your
shirt
needs
mending.
MAN:
Colonel,
do
you
mind?
A
good
officer
doesn't
ride
all
day.
TOM:
-
What
do
you
think?
About
the
Second
Maine
boys,
what
else?
-
Are
any
of
them
going
to
join
us?
What?
I
counted
by
actual
vote.
-
Well,
I'll
be.
Good.
See
to
it
they
march
together.
Yes.
Glazier's
got
the
hardheads
in
tow.
Get
the
names.
I
want
them
spread
out,
-
I'll
see
about
their
muskets.
BUFORD:
Keep
the
patrols
out.
Also
scout
up
north.
They'll
be
I
think
Lee's
turned
the
whole
army…
…
headed
this
way,
…
get
between
Meade
and
Washington.
If
I'm
right,
there'll
be
a
lot
…
and
down
that
northern
road
too,
Sir.

By
God,
I
can't
believe
Can
I
have
a
ride
on
your
pony?
There's
Johnny
Rebs
everywhere.
Sure
am
glad
to
see
you
fellas.
Your
servant,
ma'am.
Is
there
going
to
be
a
disturbance
Nothing
the
cavalry
can't
handle.
Never
knew
you
were
such
a
cavalier.
I'm
just
not
as
shy
and
reserved
Yeah,
I'm
about
as
shy
as
Rebel
raiding
parties
Peeled
the
land
of
every
cow,
Can't
chew
a
plow
horse
with
Bobby
Lee's
up
this
road
Got
the
whole
army
of
I
recommend
you
good
folks
get
back
Yeah,
for
how
long?
Till
the
shooting
stops.
Something
about
the
mayor
and
politicians
They're
too
fat
and
they
talk
too
much.
And
they
never
think
twice
You
know
what's
happening
here
Sir?
The
whole
damn
rebel
army
They'll
move
through
this
town,
When
our
people
arrive,
Lee'll
have
The
high
ground!
Meade
will
come
in
slowly,
cautiously,
They'll
be
on
his
back
from
Washington.
Wires
hot
with
messages.
Attack!
Attack!
So
he
will
set
up
a
ring
And
when
Lee's
army
is
nicely
entrenched
…
Meade
will
finally
attack,
Straight
up
the
hillside,
out
in
the
open…
…
in
that
gorgeous
field
of
fire.
We
will
charge
valiantly
And
afterward,
men
in
tall
hats
and
…
and
say
what
a
brave
charge
it
was.
-
Devin,
I've
led
a
soldier's
life…
…
and
I've
never
seen
anything
It's
as
if
I
can
actually
see
the
blue
troops
…
going
up
the
long
slope
…
as
if
it
were
already
done…
…
and
already
a
memory.
An
odd,
set…
…
stony
quality
to
it.
As
if
tomorrow
has
already
happened
The
way
you
sometimes
feel
…
knowing
it
will
fail,
You
must
even
take
part
and
help
it
fail.
Sir.
We
have
2,500
men.
They'll
be
coming
in
force.
There
could
be
20,000
If
we
hold
this
ridge
for
a
couple
of
hours,
We
can
block
that
road
We
can
deprive
the
enemy
The
boys
are
ready
for
a
brawl.
We'll
force
the
reb
to
deploy.
That's
a
narrow
road
If
we
stack
them
up,
it
will
take
them
a
Is
Calef's
battery
up
yet?
His
six
guns
are
deploying
now.
How
far
back
is
Reynolds
About
10
miles,
sir.
Not
much
more.

Sir,
you
were
right.
My
scouts
report
the
rebel
army
They're
all
concentrating
in
this
direction.

We'll
hold
here
in
the
morning.
Long
enough
for
Reynolds
If
we
hang
on
to
the
high
ground,
…
to
win
this
fight
that's
coming.
-
Understood?
Post
the
cannon
along
this
road,
The
rebels
will
hit
us
at
dawn.
Hell,
general,
He's
right,
sir.
At
Thoroughfare
Gap,
You
held
for
six
hours.
They
never
came.
We
held
for
nothing.
The
rebs
will
hit
us
just
about
first
light.
Keep
a
clear
eye.
Have
the
pickets
give
us
a
good
warning.
All
right,
gentlemen.

BUFORD
:
Gen.
Reynolds,
…
west
of
Gettysburg
I've
sent
reconnaissance
parties
…
from
which
the
enemy
I'm
satisfied
A.
P.

…
back
of
Cashtown.
The
enemy's

Rumor
says
Ewell's
coming
If
true,

One
from
the

Do
you
want
me
to
hold
Confirmation
requested.

O.

LEE
:
Come
down
and
touch
the
mountains
Blessed
be
the
Lord,
my
strength,
and
my
hands
to
war.
Amen."
Good
morning,
Lucy.
Traveler,
good
morning
to
you,
sir.
Good
morning,
sir.
Good
morning,
Major
Taylor.
How
are
you
this
morning,
sir?
Is
there
any
word
from
General
Stuart?
No,
sir.
I
would
have
There
was
no
report
at
all,
sir.
If
I
don't
hear
from
General
Stuart
by
this
Yes,
sir.
I
have
a
message
-
Yes?
…
he
is
going
to
Gettysburg
this
morning
-
For
what
purpose?
…
a
supply
of
shoes
in
the
town,
and
he
General
Hill
knows
I
want
no
fight
General
Hill
expects
no
opposition…
…
except
for
some
local
militia
Very
well.
-
Will
the
general
have
breakfast?
We
have
flapjacks
in
small
mountains.
Fresh
butter,
bacon,
wagons
of
ham,
You
really
ought
to
pitch
in,
sir.
Courtesy
of
our
host,
Has
there
been
any
trouble
Oh,
no,
sir.
No
trouble
with
them.
The
men
are
behaving
very
well.
But
there
are
some
local
women
And
though
they
don't
complain
of
…
in
the
good
dear
coin
…
well,
sir,
they
do
object
to
starving.
We
must
be
charitable
-
We
have
enough
enemies.
The
men
have
their
strict
orders.
But
I
must
admit
those
orders
would
be
…
had
the
Yankees
showed
charity
Major,
this
army
…
and
with
respect
to
all
civilian
population
And
you
will
personally
report
to
me
…
no
matter
how
minor
or
trivial
-
Yes,
sir.

LONGSTREET:
LEE:
Federal
forces
are
concentrating.
LEE:
Yes,
and
I've
confirmed
Their
new
commander
I
have
reports
of
Union
cavalry
-
Cavalry?
General
Hill
reports
only
militia.
-
He
did?
Well,
it's
cavalry.
Where
there's
cavalry,
Meade's
closing
fast.
It
could
be
he's
thinking
Behind,
in
front,
direction
does
not
matter.
Probably
got
old
Abe
Lincoln
on
his
back
We
may
have
an
opportunity
here.
I
agree.
Our
objective
was
to
get
their
army
Now
they
are
in
the
open.
General
Meade
has
been
forcing
The
weather
has
been
unusually
hot.
He
will
probably
arrive
here
worn
out
If
we
concentrate,
If
we
can
take
out
a
few
of
his
corps,
But
we
must
strike
hard
What
artillery
is
that,
major?
I
don't
know,
sir.
General
Heth
is
in
front.
-
My
instructions
were
clear?
Avoid
contact
with
the
enemy
And
General
Heth?
He
has
instructions
I
told
him
this
morning.
We
should
move
closer
to
the
front.
-
I
must
know
what
is
going
on.
General…
…
in
the
fight
that
is
coming,
This
army
has
lost
too
many
…
and
you,
sir,
have
a
very
bad
habit
Can't
lead
from
behind.
May
I
say
it
plainly,
sir.
I
cannot
afford
to
lose
you.
General,
let's
look
to
this
day.
Sir.
Major
Taylor,
have
Traveler
saddled
up.
-
I'm
gonna
look
around
for
myself.


They've
got
a
brigade
in
position
We've
got
the
best
damn
ground
around,
Lovely.
Lovely.

Go
on
down,
gentlemen.
OFFICER:
They're
on
the
run.
GAMBLE:
BUFORD:
How
are
your
losses?
We
got
them
out
in
the
open.
They
are
arrogant
people,
you
know?
We
took
some
prisoners.
That's
what
I've
got
in
front
of
me.
A
new
division.
8,000
men
more
or
less.
Just
back
up
that
road
between
here
It'll
take
them
a
little
while
to
get
on
line.
GAMBLE:
Yes,
sir,
but
Hill's
whole
corps
Longstreet
behind
that.
BUFORD:
When
John
Reynolds
gets
here,
Only
part
of
it.
The
point
is,
the
rebs
will
be
here
…
with
everything
they've
got.
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
here,
sir?
Heth
will
be
back
in
a
bit.
If
he's
got
any
brains
at
all,
…
he'll
know
by
now
he's
got
at
least
He
won't
wait
That
would
take
half
the
morning.
He
don't
need
his
whole
division.
That's
right.
Does
Devin
report
any
activity
on
his
front
-
No,
sir.
Not
a
lick.
I'll
have
Devin
leave
his
cover
…
and
have
them
move
in
alongside
you,
When
Heth
gets
back,
That
ought
to
hold
him
Right,
sir.
Damn
sure
glad
the
rain
is
gone.
Take
care
of
yourself,
colonel.
Don't
worry
about
me,
sir.

I'm

Go

-
Good

I
don't
think
they
knew

now
Now
that
you're
here,
Well,
they'll
be
coming
back.
Heth'll
come
in

thinking
he's
up
Instead
he'll
be
hitting
two

Yes,
sir.
Poor
Harry.
You
can
pull

Put

Yes,

Well,

But,
John,
I

am
glad

Gentlemen,

REYNOLDS:

Heth
probably
has
10,000

BUFORD:
Yes,

REYNOLDS:
We
can
put
almost
20,000
BUFORD:
I'm
sending

It's

BUFORD:
Now
let's
go
surprise
Harry
Heth.
LEE:
-
General
Heth.
LEE:
HETH:
Very
strange,
sir.
LEE:
I
moved
in
this
morning,
as
directed.
I
thought
it
was
only
a
few
militia,
There
weren't
all
that
many,
I
thought
we
shouldn't
be
stopped
…
but
they
made
a
good
fight.
They
really
put
up
a
scrap,
sir.
Go
on,
general.
HETH:
My
boys
got
their
dander
up.
We
deployed
the
whole
division
We
just
about
had
them
running
…
they
got
infantry
support.
We
got
pushed
back.
Then
we
re-formed
and
tried
again.
Now
there's
more
Yankee
infantry
coming.
But
I
don't
know
It
started
as
a
minor
scrap
The
next
thing
I
know,
Things
will
get
out
of
control,
Mr.
Heth.
-
Is
it
possible
you
misunderstood?
Can
you
identify
those
people?
The
infantry
is
the
First
Corps,
There's
another
corps
coming
I
must
have
all
possible
information
Major
Taylor,
I
want
you
to
ride
forward
-
And
do
be
careful.
-
Sir,
shall
I
attack?
We
are
not
ready
for
full
engagement.
General
Longstreet
is
not
up
HETH:
If
we
throw
all
our
forces
in
the
field,

Is
that
our
artillery?
Yes,
sir.
I
can't
imagine
what
has
happened
-
I've
heard
nothing.
Do
you
understand?
I
have
no
idea
of
what
lies
in
front
of
me.
LIEUTENANT:
Sir,
compliments
Rebels
are
coming
from
the
north.
That'll
be
Ewell's
corps.
We
got
to
meet
them
Tell

to
get
up
that
way

Is
that
Pender's

Four

TOM:
One
thing
about
this
brigade
Ever
hear
tell
of
Dan
Butterfield?
What,
General
Butterfield?
That's
the
same
fellow.
-
He
used
to
be
our
brigade
commander.
-
No
man
like
him
for
having
a
good
time.
But
I
know
he
used
to
like
The
problem
with
this
army
is,
We
got
a
call
for
artillery,
infantry,
Anyway,
old
Butterfield,
he
wrote
Say
there
is
an
order
for
this
brigade,
He'll
be
blowing
his
bugle,
we
will
think
We'll
follow
that
order
anyway,
Yeah,
that
happened
to
me
once.
Half
the
regiment
charged,
You
had
your
choice.
This
here
brigade
got
a
special
call.
You
hear
that
call,
It
goes
like
this.

See,
the
call's
like
"Dan
Butterfield."

In
the
middle
of
a
fight,
You
can
remember
that.

Butterfield,
he
wrote
a
lot
You
ever
hear
"Butterfield's
Lullaby"?
Butterfield's
what?

Colonel,
sir.
Begging
the
colonel's
pardon.
But
would
the
colonel
please
do
us
a
favor
I'll
tell
you,
sir,
…
when
the
officers
act
MAN:
Lawrence,
sir.

We've
gone
over
20
miles
today.
We've
gone
over
100
miles

There's
something
going
on.
LAWRENCE:
Col.
Vincent,
sir.
Far
cry
from
Bowdoin
College,
No
farther
than
Harvard
Yard.
Indeed.
With
luck,
we'll
both
see
In
the
meantime,
colonel,
you
move
Two
corps
have
engaged
at
Gettysburg.
So
we'll
keep
going
through
dark
-
Yes,
sir.

OFFICER:

They're
running!
They're
running!
General
Pender
begs
to
report
-
They're

the
run.

Early
…
on
the
left
flank,
-
They're
all
running.
Find
General
Hill's
chief
of

Tell
him

want
fire
placed
on
that
hill.

Yes,

Taylor.
Deliver
this
message
in

Tell

must
only
push

to
take
that
hill,
if
practical.

Do
you
understand?

Very
well.
Congratulations,
general.
I
want
you
to
see
this.

Manassas
Couldn't
have
worked
better
If
we
can
take
that
hill,
Sir,
the
Federal
army
has
fallen
back

reforming
on
the
ridges
Very
well.
This
is
almost
perfect.
Let's
move
south
and
east,
…
find
some
high
ground…
…
and
they'll
have
to
hit
us.
Then
we
have
them,
general.
You
mean
disengage?
I've
always
been
under
the
impression…
…
that
it
was
our
strategy
to
conduct
…
in
order
to
keep
the
army
intact.
Granted,
but
the
situation
has
changed.
-
How?
They're
on
the
run,
vacating
the
town.
How
can
we
move
off
-
Major
Marshall?
I
ordered
firing
on
that
hill,
-
Send
over
and
find
out
why.
Thank
you.
What
are
you
thinking,
general?
Maybe
we
should
not
have
fought
here.
I
know
that.
But
we
have
prevailed.
LONGSTREET:
But
in
the
morning,
…
and
they'll
be
entrenched
You
know
as
well
as
I,
we've
never
been

If
we
move
south
to
Washington,
Then
we
can
fight
on
ground
But
the

is
here.

did
not
want
the
fight,
How
can
I
ask
this
army
to
retreat
Not
retreat,
sir.
Re-deploy.
Our
guns
will
move
them
off
that
hill
But
if
Meade
is
there
tomorrow,
I
will
attack

If
Meade
is
up

but

figure,

can't

were.
LAWRENCE:
We
had

They
were
always
very
polite,
academic,

stayed
off
the
question
of
slavery
But
toward
the
end
there
was
…
and
yet
I
could
never
understand.
I
don't
know
why.
They
fight
so
well.
Tell
me
something,
Buster…
…
what
do
you
think
of
Negroes?
Well,
if
you
mean
the
race…
…
I
don't
really
know.
This
is
not
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of.
The
thing
is,
you
cannot
judge
a
race.
Any
man
who
judges
by
the
group
You
take
men
one
at
a
time.
To
me,
there
was
never
any
difference.
-
None
at
all?
Of
course,
I
haven't
known
…
but
those
I
knew
in
Bangor,
Portland…
…
you
look
in
the
eye,
there
was
a
man.
There
was
a
"divine
spark,"
That's
all
there
is
to
it.
Races
are
men.
"What
a
piece
of
work
is
man.
How
infinite
in
faculties,
…
how
express
and
admirable.
In
action,
how
like
an
angel."
Well,
if
he's
an
angel,
all
right
then…
…
but
he
damn
well
must
be
a
killer
angel.
Colonel,
darling,
you're
a
lovely
man.
I
see
a
vast
great
difference
between
us,
You're
an
idealist,
praise
be.
The
truth
is,
colonel…
…
there
is
no
"divine
spark."
There's
many
a
man
alive
no
more
of
value
When
you've
seen
them
hang
each
other
Equality?
What
I'm
fighting
for
is
the
right
to
prove
Where
have
you
seen
this
"divine
spark"
Where
have
you
noted
No
two
things
on
earth
are
equal
Not
a
leaf,
not
a
tree.
There's
many
a
man
worse
than
me
…
but
I
don't
think
race
or
country
What
matters,
colonel…
…
is
justice.
Which
is
why
I'm
here.
I'll
be
treated
as
I
deserve…
…
not
as
my
father
deserved.
I'm
Kilrain…
…
and
I
damn
all
gentlemen.
There
is
only
one
aristocracy…
…
and
that
is
right
here.
And
that's
why
we've
got
to
win
this
war.

PICKETT:
Hello,
my
boys.

PICKETT:
General
Pickett
presents
…
and
asks
to
parler
with

Hey,
George.
PICKETT:
Good
Lord,
what
is
that
smell?
That's
me.
Ain't
it
lovely?
He
got
it
off
a
dead
Frenchman.
-
Good
evening.
PICKETT:
I
did
not
get
it
off
I
bought
it
in
a
store
It
did
have
a
French
name,

-
How
are
you,
general?
Real
good.
Dick,
how's
it
going?
Fine,
John,
just
fine.
Good.
Oh,
listen,
I
am
sorry
to
assign
you
…
but
I
hear
tell
you
have
General,
I
want
you
to
know…
…
how
much
I
appreciate
this
opportunity
Let
it
go,
Dick.
Let
it
go.
I
consider
it
a
damn
fine
piece
of
luck…
…
to
have
a
man
of
your
caliber
Uh,
general,
sir.
LONGSTREET:
Gentlemen?
Colonel
Fremantle?
Allow
me
to
introduce
General
Pickett,
…
of
Her
Majesty's
venerable
…
Britain's
military
attache
…
and,
you
might
say,
Hardly,
sir.
I'm
merely
an
observer
Sir…
…
the
fame
of
your
regiment
LONGSTREET:
General
Pickett
here
The
First
Corps
Army
of
Northern
Virginia.
They
do.
They
do
indeed.
His
record
at
West
Point
You
know
I
consider
it
unbecoming
-
Book
learning
ain't
for
gentlemen,
right?
He
graduated
last
in
his
class.
Dead
last.
Quite
a
feat,
considering
his
classmates.

The
Yankees
got
all
the
smart
ones.
Colonel,
allow
me
Each
one
of
these
chaps,
as
you
might
say,
Now
this
fellow
here,
this
is
Lo
Armistead.
Lo!
That's
short
for
Lothario.
The
lover.
This
here
is
Richard
Brooke
Garnett.
He
got
kicked
by
his
horse
the
other
day.
That
fellow
there…
That's
Jim
Kemper.
You
note
the
shifty
eye,
He's
not
even
a
West
Pointer,
He's
a
politician
from
Virginia.
KEMPER:
I
was
Speaker
of
the
House
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I'd
like
to
talk
to
you
You
know
the
queen,
don't
you?
What
I
need
to
know
When
are
you
going
to
do
something…
…
about
that
damn
Yankee
blockade
Can
you
tell
me
something
about
that?
Time
for
some
branch
water.
Come
on.
General?
Sir.
Might
I
have
a
few
words?
Sure,
George.
Come
on.
I
must
confess
I'm
rather
curious
Up
until
tonight,
he
never
seemed
to
Almost
dour,
one
would
have
Well,
if
I
were
you,
colonel,
He
just
happens
to
be
about
the
best
There
was
a
time
you'd
have
Scarlet
fever
hit
Richmond
last
winter,
General
lost
all
three
of
his
children
The
youngest
was
10.
Hasn't
been
quite
the
same
since.
-
Um…
The
queen.
Her
majesty.
Well,
see,
you
are
looking
fine.
Looking
lovely
yourself,
George.
General.
No
reflection
on
you,
sir…
…
but
you
know,
my
division,
…
we
haven't
seen
all
that
much
action
I
mean,
well,
we
weren't
that
engaged
We
missed
Chancellorsville
altogether.
Now
they
took
two
of
my
brigades,
…
off
to
guard
Richmond.
And
now,
sir,
do
you
know
where
Last,
sir.
That's
where
I
am,
exactly
last.
Beg
pardon,
sir.
…
are
beginning
to
feel
a
trifle
disgusted
…
as
fighting
men,
sir.
My
boys-
-
George.
-
Please.
No.
Hell
no,
sir.
No,
it's
just,
uh…
See,
I
was
just-
I
was
hoping,
sir,
…
talk
to
somebody
about
this
Would
you
like
me
to
move
the
whole
army
Sir?
Now
that
you
mention
it…
There
is
no
plot,
George.
I
mean,
hell,
look
at
it
this
way.
If
the
army
has
to
turn
around,
…
well,
you'll
be
first
in
line.
Yes,
I
suppose
that
is
true,
isn't
it?
You
understand,
sir.
That
this
whole
damn
war
…
and
my
Virginia
boys
Yeah,
I
know.
How
far
back
are
they?
Chambersburg,
a
hard
day's
march,
sir.
Mm-hm.
I
know
I
can
count
on
you,
George,
…
and
it
will
come.
It
will
come.
Sorry
to
butt
in,
but
they're
calling
Your
fame,
sir,
has
preceded
you.
Well,
thank
you,
general.
Well,
cheerio,
fellas.
Don't
forget
to
bring
your
money.
Have
you
heard
any
news
of
old
Winfield?
Old
Winnie
boy?
Hancock?
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
how's
he
doing?
-
You're
gonna
find
out.
He's
got
the
Second
Corps.
He's
headed
this
way.
Probably
run
ARMISTEAD:
I
haven't
seen
him
since
before
the
war.
Never
thought
it
would
last
this
long.
Me
neither,
Lo.
I
sure
would
like
to
talk
One
more
time.
Well,
why
not?
You
wouldn't
mind?
Hell,
no.
I
mean,
really.
Do
you
think
it
would
be
proper?
Look,
when
the
time
comes,
…
just
send
a
messenger
over
Ain't
nothing
to
it.
Last
time
I
saw
him
was
in
California.
Right
when
the
war
was
beginning…
…
the
night
before
we
all
left
Old
friends
off
to
war.
-
Hey,
Lo.
-
How's
your
brigade?
I've
never
seen
troops
anywhere
I've
got
to
give
the
old
man
credit.
Who
else
could've
held
Remember
what
they
used
to
say
When
he
first
took
command?
Lord,
what
damn
fools
we
were.
Now
when
he
passes…
…
the
boys
hush
as
if
they
had
seen
Have
you
ever
seen
anything
like
that?
No.
I
can't
say
I
have.
It's
amazing
what
one
honest
man
can
do.
Mm.
One
honest
man
and
a
cause.
I
don't
think
on
that
too
much
anymore.
I
guess
my
only
cause
is
victory.
This
war
comes
as
a
nightmare.
Then
you
put
your
head
down
and
win.

Old
gloomy
Pete!
You
see,
colonel…
…
the
government
derives
its
power
Every
government,
everywhere.
Let
me
make
this
very
plain
to
you,
sir.
We
do
not
consent
And
what
you've
got
to
do
is,
…
to
your
Parliament
and
you've
got
You've
got
to
tell
them
…
is
the
freedom
from
what
we
consider
I
mean,
that's
all
we
want.
-
Jim.
Now,
we
established
this
country
…
with
very
strong
state
governments…
…
just
for
that
very
reason.
I
mean,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
My
home
is
in
Virginia.
The
government
of
my
home
is
home.
Virginia
would
not
allow
itself
…
by
some
king
over
there
in
London.
It's
not
about
to
let
itself
be
ruled
Virginia,
by
God,
sir,
Oh,
my.
The
cause.
PICKETT:
And
it's
all
for
the
Yankees.
The
damn
money-grubbing
Yankees.
I
mean,
those
damn
fools,
Always
the
darkies.
PICKETT:
Sit
down.
I
think
that
my
idea…
…
my
analogy
of
a
gentlemen's
club
Colonel,
think
on
it
now.
Suppose
that
we
all
joined
a
club,
After
a
time,
several
of
the
members
…
into
our
private
lives,
our
home
lives.
Began
telling
us
Well,
then,
wouldn't
any
one
of
us
I
mean,
just
resign.
That's
what
we
did.
That's
what
I
did
and
now
these
people

I
got
to
hand
it
to
you.
You
certainly
do
have
a
talent
…
and
complicating
the
obvious.
Have
you
ever
considered
No.
It's
a
thought.
What
does
Colonel
Fremantle
think?
Will
the
British
come
in
on
our
side?
Hell,
yeah.
They'll
come
in
Like
some
damn
bank
lending
you
money
PICKETT:
Look
here,
Mr.
Speaker…
A
word?
Good
night,
colonel.
FREMANTLE:
LONGSTREET:
In
the
next
few
days,
I
want
you
to
do
everything
necessary
You
can
start
bringing
them
up
I
want
you
all
in
Gettysburg
PICKETT:
GIBBON:
I'm
surprised
you
could
find
headquarters
BUFORD:
"Follow
the
cigar
smoke

BUFORD:
How
are
you,
John?
BUFORD:
But
the
brigades
are
pretty
shot
up.
HANCOCK:
Right.
I'll
see
to
it.
That
was
Thank
you,
sir.
Heard
you
were
with
John
Reynolds
I'm
sending
the
body
up
They
might
appreciate
a
note
from
you.
I'll
send
it.

He
was
a
soldier.
And
a
good
friend.
Three
of
us,
Reynolds,
Mexican
War.
California.
We
stayed
close.
I
wonder
how
old
Lo
is
doing.
Heard
he
had
one
of
Pickett's
brigades.
Under
Longstreet.
Remarkable.
Just
across
the
ridge,
eh?

I'd
like
to
see
him
again,
but
not
here.
Well,
maybe
after
the
war,
eh?
Where
do
you
want
me
in
the
morning?
I
want
you
to
hold
your
position
Get
some
rest
if
you
can.
We
may
need
you
in
the
morning.
Jeb
Stuart's
still
on
the
prowl
Yes,
sir.
Well,
General
Reynolds…
…
we
held
the
high
ground.
General
Trimble
is
waiting.
-
Will
you
see
him?
I
want
a
scouting
party
sent
out
-
Yes,
sir.
Right
away.
LEE:
Sir,
I
most
respectfully
request
Do
please
go
on,
general.
The
man
is
a
disgrace.
Sir,
have
you
been
listening
at
all
Ask
General
Gordon
or
General
Ewell.
We
could've
taken
that
hill.
God
in
his
wisdom
knows
There
was
no
one
there
at
all
General
Gordon
saw
it.
Me
and
Ewell
and
Gordon…
…
all
standing
in
the
dark
like
idiots
I
beg
your
pardon,
general.
That
bloody
damned
hill
was
bare
We
all
saw
it,
as
God
is
my
witness.
We
were
all
there.
I
said
to
him,
"General
Ewell,
General
Jackson
wouldn't
have
stopped
…
and
plenty
of
light
God
help
us!
I
don't
know-
I
don't
know
why
I…
Do
please
continue,
general.
Yes,
sir.
Sir.
I
said
to
General
Ewell
these
words…
I
said
to
him:
"Sir,
give
me
one
division
He
said
nothing.
I
said,
"General
Ewell,
…
and
I
will
take
that
hill."
I
was
becoming
disturbed,
sir.
And
General
Ewell
put
his
arms
So
I
said,
…
and
I
will
take
that
hill."
And
he
said
nothing.
He
just
stood
there.
I
threw
down
my
sword.
We
could
have
done
it,
sir.
A
blind
man
should
have
seen
it.
Now
they're
working
up
there.
You
can
hear
the
axes
And
so
in
the
morning…
…
many
a
good
boy
will
die…
…
taking
that
hill.
Sir.
I
must
request
another
assignment.
No,
sir.
That
won't
be
necessary.
You
will
be
of
great
service.
And
I
do
thank
you.
HANCOCK:
Hancock.
It's
so
damn
dark
out
there
Well,
gentlemen.
I
hope
to
God
that
this
is…
…
good
ground.
Is
this
good
ground,
general?
Is
this
the
place
to
have
an
army?
Very
good
ground,
sir.
Very
good
ground.
I
hope
you
are
right.
Because
we
are
going
to
have
a
fight
here
General
Ewell,
I
had
hoped
that
…
you
would've
taken
that
hill.
I
didn't
think
it
was
practical.
Well,
for
many
reasons.
We
marched
all
day,
and
we'd
fought.
And
your
orders
were
to
caution
There
were
reports
of
Federal
troops
We
couldn't
bring
sufficient
artillery
We
decided
it
was
best
to
wait
Yes,
sir.
Johnson
didn't
arrive
He's
out
there
now,
General
Early,
do
you
think
you
can

That
hill
will
be
a
very
strong
position
…
which
is
what
they're
doing
I
am
very
much
aware
of
that,
general.
Have
you
looked
over
From
a
distance
only.
I
do
not
think
we
should
attack
This
will
be
the
strong
point.
Our
troops
have
marched
hard
I
suggest
we
hold
here
while
the
rest
Do
you
think
an
attack
on
your
flank
I
think
it
would
be
very
costly.
Very
costly,
sir.
General
Rodes?
We,
uh,
could
attack
of
course,
general…
…
but
the
boys
have
had
a
good
fight
General,
I
am
sorry
we
didn't
Well,
this
day
is
done.
You
know,
General
Longstreet
proposes
…
and
flank
the
Federal
army…
…
and
interpose
between
And
to
vacate
this
position?
To
leave
this
town
This
town
is
of
no
military
significance
To
move
this
entire
corps
in
the
face
And
yet
you
tell
me
Gentlemen,
if
we
do
not
withdraw
and
if
we
…
then
we
must
attack.
-
General
Hill?
Very
well.
I
do
thank
you
gentlemen.

General…
…
I
believe
I
may
have
been
I
regret
that
very
much.
I
was
trying
to
be
careful.
May
have
been
too
careful.
You
won
a
victory
this
day,
general.
It
was
not
a
large
victory.
Perhaps
we
could've
pushed
harder.
But
it
was
a
victory
nonetheless.
And
your
people
fought
valiantly.
This
was
your
first
campaign
Now
you
know
it's
not
always
Go
and
rest
now
for
tomorrow.

-
Will
there
be
anything
else,
sir?
Very
well.
LEE
:
Tomorrow
or
the
next
day
Virginia
is
here.
All
the
South
is
here.
What
will
you
do
tomorrow?
In
the
morning…
…
the
enemy
will
be
up
Longstreet's
corps
will
be
coming
up…
…
and
my
boys
will
be
ready
If
I
tell
them
to
withdraw
now?
No,
sir.
They've
been
patient
for
far
too
long.
With
the
enemy
out
there
up
on
the
hill…
…
they'll
be
ready
to
finish
the
job.
But
I
don't
even
know
How
many
men?
How
many
cannon?
/
don't
know
the
ground
on
the
flanks.
/
don't
know.
If
I
wait
in
the
morning,
…
maybe
Meade,
That
would
make
General
Longstreet
But
I
don't
think
Meade
will
come
down.
And
I
don't
think
I
can
withdraw,
so…
…
God's
will,
thy
will
be
done.
LONGSTREET:
Major
Sorrel,
SORREL:
The
Federal
position
was
scouted
We've
drawn
it
up
here.
Now,
this
is
the
situation.
The
position
of
the
Federal
army
It
starts
here.
You
see
these
two
hills?
This
one
and
the
one
with
the
cemetery.
That
is
where
they
have
concentrated
The
hook
starts
there.
Now,
it
curves
around
and
comes
down
…
ending
before
two
round
hills
The
Federals
have
no
troops
LONGSTREET:
Carry
on.
We
now
know
that
General
Hancock
There
are
now
perhaps
60,000
Perhaps
as
high
as
90,000.

LEE:
I
spoke
with
General
Ewell
…
that
we
move
around
to
the
right
And
he
is
of
the
opinion
that
…
and
giving
it
back
to
the
enemy
It
is
unnecessary.
Do
you
disagree?
We
must
attack.
I
would
prefer
not
to
fight
…
but
every
moment
we
delay
We
cannot
support
ourselves
We
must
not
allow
the
Federal
army
…
and
cut
us
off
from
home.
No,
sir.
We
must
strike
him
now.
LEE:
We
pushed
him
yesterday
The
men
are
ready
and
they
are
eager.
LONGSTREET:
LEE:
Gentlemen.
-
Good
morning,
all.
Longstreet
will
attack
on
the
right
Hill
will
support…
…
with
Heth
in
reserve.
Ewell's
people
on
the
left
…
from
reinforcing
against
our
right
flank.
Yes,
sir.
But
I
still
don't
have
Pickett.
He's
at
the
rear
of
column,
All
I've
got
is
Hood
and
McLaws.
I
do
believe
that
Hood's
-
With
the
general's
permission.
Moving
in
front
of
those
rocky
heights,
…
coming
down
on
us.
Perhaps,
but
not
for
long.
Your
division…
…
will
be
up
over
this
unoccupied
hill,
From
there
you
will
threaten
When
you're
heavily
engaged,
Very
well,
sir.
-
General?
Sir.
LEE:
General
Barksdale,
-
Mississippi
is
ready.
Let's
go
to
it,
Sam.
If
he's
right,
General
Lee…
…
then
the
war
is
over
by
sundown.
Hm.
We'll
see.
I
don't
like
going
in
without
Pickett.
It's
like
going
in
with
one
boot
off.
I'll
wait
as
long
as
I
can.
Do
you
have
any
idea
of
the
force?
We
counted
five
corps,
including
That
don't
mean
how
many

And,
damn
it,

Hey,
Sam.
Take
good
care
of
yourself
today,
You,
too,
Pete.
With
your
permission,
sir.
I
don't
believe
I've
had
the
pleasure.
That's
Major
General
John
Bell
Hood,
One
of
my
three
division
commanders.
Oh,
you've
been
to
Texas,
as
I
recall.
Yes.
Actually
that's
where
I
came
through.
Courtesy
of
the
Yankee
Navy
It's
a
marvelous
place,
Texas.
Full
of
red
Indians
and
Mexicans…
…
cowboys,
bandits
and
desperados.
Even
hotter
and
more
humid
If
that's
possible.

That
fellow
Hood…
…
does
his
performance
in
battle
He
really
does
look
the
part.
He
does
his
job.
Most
interesting
army,
I
must
say.
Virginia
gentlemen
fighting
…
and
bayou
bushwhackers
Drawn
together
from
across
a
continent.
Having
traveled
a
good
piece
of
it
myself,
…
or
almost
a
member
of
this
enterprise.
You
call
yourselves
Americans,
Look
at
your
names,
Lee,
Hood…
…
Longstreet,
Jackson,
Stuart.
My
people
were
Dutch.
And
the
same
for
your
adversaries.
…
shall
I
say?
Lincoln.
The
same
God.
Same
language.
The
same
songs,
stories,
legends,
myths.
But
different
dreams.
Different
dreams.
It's
so
very
sad.
Very
sad.
You
English
had
your
own
civil
war
once,
That
was
ages
ago.
Cavaliers
and
Roundheads.
"Off
with
his
head!
Off
with
his
head!"
Heads
lying
everywhere.
One
could
hardly
take
a
step
We're
much
more
civilized
now,
We
have
so
much
in
common,
I
earnestly
hope
Your
government
would
never
ally
itself
…
that
had
the
institution
of
slavery.

We
should
have
freed
the
slaves,
I
guess
we
Southerners
and
you
English
We'd
rather
lose
the
war
We
whupped
you
British
twice

Your
candor
is
admirable,
A
little
eccentricity
is
good
for
a
general.
We
Southerners
like
our
men

I
suspect
that's
why

I
may
be

bold…

I
notice
you

today.
But

Then
the

Which

certainly

Oh,

Very
clever.
Very
clever.
So
Lee
doesn't
dig

knowing
with
certainty
Meade
will
expect
him
to

in
an
attempt
to

So
while
Meade
ponders
his

by

Good
morning,
Colonel
Freemantle.

ALL:
LEE:
Do
you
mind
if
I
accompany
you?
Not
at
all.
I'm
very
glad
The
heat
reminds
me
of
Mexico.
Yes,
but
there
it
was
very
dry.
That
was
a
good
outfit.
I
remember
storming
the
ramparts
Reynolds…
My
old
friend,
-
There
was
some
good
men
in
that
army.
Some
of
those
men
are
waiting
for
us
now
I
don't
know.
I
sometimes
feel
troubled.
Those
fellows,
those
boys
in
blue,
I
know.
I
used
to
command
some
of
those
boys.
I
couldn't
fight
against
Georgia
Not
against
my
own
family.
No,
sir.
There
was
always
a
higher
duty
That
was
our
first
duty.
There
was
never
any
question
about
that.
-
I
guess
so.
The
issue
is
in
God's
hands.
We
can
only
do
our
duty.
General?
Soldiering
has
one
great
trap.
To
be
a
good
soldier
To
be
a
good
commander,
…
of
the
thing
you
love.
We
do
not
fear
our
own
death,
you
and
I.
But
there
comes
a
time…
We
are
never
quite
prepared
We
do
expect
the
occasional
empty
chair.
…
but
this
war
goes
on
and
on
…
and
the
price
gets
ever
higher.
We
are
prepared
to
lose
some
of
us,
And
there
is
the
great
trap,
general.
When
you
attack,
You
must
commit
yourself
totally.
We
are
adrift
here
in
a
sea
of
blood,
I
want
this
to
be
the
final
battle.
I
woke
up
this
morning
and
I
half
thought
That
he
would
not
want
to
fight
here.
I
woke
up
and
I
thought,
…
and
this
war
will
go
on
and
on
and
on."
Well,
sir…
…
we'll
make
him
sorry
he
stayed.
God
go
with
you,

And
with
you,

That's
mostly
to

All

Just

the
right.
We
should've
gone
to
the
right.
CULLEN:


You
summoned
me,
sir?
Harrison.
I
did.
I've
got
some
night
work.
Are
you
up
to
it?
"All
the
world
will
be
in
love
with
night…
…
and
pay
no
worship
to
the
garish
sun."
When
this
is
all
over,
HARRISON:
I
want
you
to
go
out
on
the
right,
Their
condition,
what
they've
got
It'll
probably
take
all
night.
-
Your
obedient
servant.
Now,
Harrison,
it'll
be
dangerous.
Thank
you,
sir.
But
I
must
confess,
…
is
the
absence
of
an
audience.
When
you
do
it
right,
no
one
knows
it.
Nobody
ever
watches
your
work.
That's
very
hard
on
an
actor.
This
current
creation
is
marvelous.
I'm
a
poor
half-witted
farmer,
…
terrified
of
soldiers.
And
me
lovely
And
I'm
out
scouring
Sorrowful,
pitiful
sight
I
am.
…
grinning
behind
me
back.
And
the
whole
time
telling
me
…
about
who's
where,
how
many,
And
them
not
even
knowing
Too
busy
feeling
contemptuous.
There
are
many
people,
general,
don't
give
Strange
thing
is…
…
after
playing
this
poor
fool
farmer
for
…
because
no
one
cares.
No
one
cares.
Well…
…
we
all
have
our
sacrifices
to
make,
Indeed
we
do,
sir.
All
right,
Harrison,
on
your
horse,
-
And,
Harrison…
…
you
be
real
careful,
you
hear?
Thank
you,
sir.
LONGSTREET:

LEE:
LONGSTREET:
I've
just
come
by
It
would
appear
LONGSTREET:
It
was
very
close
this
afternoon.
Sir?
They
nearly
broke.
I
could
feel
them
breaking.
There
for
a
moment
I
thought
I
saw
It
wasn't
that
close.
The
attacks
were
not
properly
coordinated.
And
nevertheless,
we
nearly
won
the
day.
I
could
see
a
clear
road

How
is
it
with
General
Hood?
I
think
he'll
live.
May
lose
an
arm.
Dear
God.
I
couldn't
spare
General
Hood.
So
many
good
men
were
lost
this
day.
Sir?
Lo
did
take
the
peach
orchard
But
he
couldn't
get
up
that
ridge.
And
Hood,
he
seized
the
Devil's
Den,
The
Federals
still
hold
the
heights.
General?
That
way
around
to
the
right
is
still
open.
I
will
think
on
it,
general.
We
have
enough
artillery
I
know.
Let
me
think
on
it.
-
General-
We
will
speak
again
in
the
morning.
You
know,
hearing
you
talk
…
I
remember
the
time
There
was
one
tree
It
was
a
skinny
little
tree
…
in
a
long
thin
line
It
swayed
to
one
side,
then
the
other.
A
shell
came
this
way,
A
cannonball
came
that
way,
It
was
a
thing
to
see.
George,
what
has
that
got
to
do
General.
Carry
on,
gentlemen.
General,
you're
just
in
time.
I've
been
trying
to
persuade
George
here
…
theories
of
Charles
Darwin.
The
notion
that
all
mankind
He
does
not
subscribe.
-
That
so?
I've
ordered
General
Armistead
to
stop
Now,
you
are
to
devote
…
in
matters
of
military
significance.
Ordered
me.
Or
perhaps
appropriating
-
Absolutely.
No,
thank
you.
Surely
the
commanding
general
…
at
this
simian
suggestion.
I
suppose
there's
some
pretty
smart
folk
They
would
not
be
invited
to
join
General
Longstreet,
sir.
I
intend
to
lay
this
matter
to
rest
Good.
Sirs,
perhaps
there
are
…
who
think
that
you
are
I
suppose
it's
possible
…
who
believe
that
I'm
descended
…
but
I
challenge
the
man
…
who
believes
that
General
Lee
-
Here,
here.
George,
all
science
trembles
before
So
exactly
how
many
of
your
relatives
Well…
What
do
you
hear
about
Sam
Hood?
He
may
lose
an
arm.
Dick
Garnett
ain't
fit.
Can't
hardly
walk.
Thing
is,
if
there's
a
fight,
But
if
you
ordered
him
to
stay
out…
I
don't
suppose
you
could
do
that.
[MAN
SINGING
Mm-hm.
That
boy
can
sing.
That's
"Kathleen
Mavourneen."
What
do
you
hear
about
Hancock?
Ran
into
him
today.
He's
out
there
about
a
mile
or
so.
Just
a
mile
or
so.
And
he
was
tough.
Very
tough
today.
ARMISTEAD:
God
don't
make
them
any
better.
LONGSTREET:
ARMISTEAD:
I'd
like
to
go
over
to
see
him
The
last
time
I
saw
Winn…
…
we
played
that
song.
That
very
song.

Back
in
California,
Before
we
broke
up.
Spring
of
'61.
Almira
Hancock.
Do
you
remember
Almira,
Hancock's
wife?
Beautiful
woman.
Most
perfect
woman
I
ever
saw.
They
were
a
beautiful
couple.
Beautiful.
Garnett
was
with
me
that
night.
A
lot
of
fellows
from
the
old
outfit.
…
in
the
blue
uniform.
We
were
leaving
the
next
day.
Some
going
north.
Some
going
south.
Splitting
up.
A
soldier's
farewell.
"Goodbye.
Good
luck.
I'll
see
you
in
hell."

Do
you
remember
that?

Towards
the
end
of
the
evening…
…
we
all
sat
around
the
piano.
Almira
played…
…
that
song
there,
Maybe
for
years,
maybe
forever…
I'll
never
forget
that.
You
know
how
it
was,
Pete.
Winn
was
like
a
brother
to
me.
Towards
the
end
of
the
evening…
…
things
got
a
little
rough.
We
all
began
to…
Well…
…
there
were
a
lot
of
tears.
I
went
over
to
Hancock.
I
took
him
by
the
shoulder.
I
said,
…
so
help
me…
…
if
I
ever
raise
my
hand
against
you…
…
may
God
strike
me
dead."
Ain't
seen
him
since.
He
was
at
Malvern
Hill…
…
White
Oak
Swamp,
One
of
these
days
Across
that…
…
small
deadly
space.
I
thought
about
sitting
this
one
out.
But
I
can't
do
that.
That
wouldn't
be
right
either.
I
guess
not.
Thank
you,
Peter.
I
had
to
talk
about
that.
I'm
sending
Almira
Hancock…
…
a
small
package
to
be
opened…
…
in
the
event
of
my
death.
You'll
drop
by
and
see
her…
…
after
this
is
over.
Won't
you,
Pete?
Thank
you.
What
day
is
it
now,
major?
It's
long
after
midnight,
sir.
It's
already
Friday.
-
Friday,
July
3?
-
Then
tomorrow
is
the
Fourth
of
July.
Independence
Day.
Huh.
-
I'd
quite
forgotten.
I'm
very
sorry
to
keep
you
up
so
late.
It
is
my
pleasure.
We
should
have
a
larger
staff.
I'd
be
offended,
sir.
I
can
do
the
work.
Very
well.
General
Stuart
is
waiting
to
see
you,
sir.
-
Shall
I
bring
him
in?
-
Major?
General
Stuart
and
I
-
Very
well,
sir.
TAYLOR:
You
wish
to
see
me,
sir.

It
is
the
opinion
of
some
excellent
officers
Sir,
if
you
will
please
tell
me
There
will
be
none
of
that.
I
ask
that
I
be
allowed
to
defend
my-
There
is
no
time.
General
Stuart.
Your
mission
was
to
free
this
army…
…
from
the
enemy
cavalry.
And
to
report
any
movement
That
mission
was
not
fulfilled.
You
left
here…
…
with
no
word
of
your
movement
Meanwhile
we
were
engaged
…
without
adequate
knowledge
Without
knowledge
of
the
ground.
So
it
is
only
by
God's
grace
General
Lee,
there
were
reasons.
LEE:
Perhaps
you
Perhaps
I
did
not
make
myself
clear.
Well,
sir,
this
must
be
made
very
clear.
You,
sir…
…
with
your
cavalry,
Without
your
cavalry,
we
are
made
blind.
That
has
already
happened
once.
It
must
never,
never
happen
again.
-
Since
I
no
longer
hold
the
general's--
There
is
no
time.
There
is
another
fight
coming
tomorrow
We
need
every
man.
God
knows.
You
must
take
what
I
have
told
you…
…
and
learn
from
it
as
a
man
does.
There
has
been
a
mistake.
It
will
not
happen
again.
You
are
one
of
the
finest
cavalry
officers
…
and
your
service
to
this
army
Now…
…
let
us
speak
no
more
of
this.
The
matter
is
concluded.
TOM:
What
are
you
doing
up
here?
I'm
just
resting
my
leg.
All
right.
You
sure
can
see
a
ways
from
here.
LAWRENCE:
TOM:
…
and
found
some
more
departed
souls
…
and
they
were
carrying
coffee
You're
a
ghoul.
Lawrence.
You
did
real
good
yesterday.
The
way
them
rebs
just
kept
coming.
You
had
to
admire
them.
You
think
they'll
come
again
today?
It
doesn't
look
like
We
don't
have
but
100
men.
Even
with
the
whole
flock
This
position's
good.

Diversion.
Go
alert
the
pickets.
That
may
be
a
diversion.
Where's
the
ammunition
I
asked
for?
Go
check
the
hospital,
see
about
the
boys.
Very
well,
sir.
We
need
another
runner.
I
keep
going
up
and
down
this
hill,

LEE:
Morning,
General.
LEE:
Ride
with
me,
if
you
will.
LEE:
General
Longstreet,
you
have
I
want
you
to
bring
your
corps
forward.
Take
those
heights
in
the
center
Sir,
uh…

…
my
two
divisions,
They
executed
a
forced
march
yesterday
Lost
half
of
their
strength.
Sustained
50
percent
casualties,
sir.
They
are
tired
and
need
rest.
There
are…
…
now
three
Federal
corps
on
those
two
If
I
move
all
my
people
forward…
…
we
won't
have
a
flank
at
all.
They'll
simply
swing
around
They
are
well
entrenched
up
there.
They
got
good
artillery
and
plenty
of
it.
Sir,
any
attack
we
make
How
do
we
communicate?
They're
all
massed
together,
Good
interior
lines.
Anywhere
we
hit
them,
But
we
try
to
bring
up
support,
Their
cannon
will
see
every
move.
Hell,
their
cannon
are
looking
down
In
the
center,
they
will
break.
Sir?
They
will
break
in
the
center.
They'll
be
gaining
men
from
all
directions,
…
and
Richmond
has
nothing
left
If
we
retreat
now,
…
and
will
leave
knowing
And
I
have
never
yet
left
the
enemy
Retreat
is
no
longer
an
option.
The
enemy
has
been
attacked
He
has
reinforced
there…
…
and
is
strongest
there
on
the
wings.
So
the
weak
point
is
in
the
center.
They
have
command
of
the
high
ground.
But
in
that
long
slope,
you
see
there?
The
long
slope
in
the
center,
General
Pickett's
Virginians
With
General
Longstreet
in
command,
…
meeting
the
enemy
face
to
face
…
and
with
honor,
we
will
prevail.
Sir,
a
courier
from
Colonel
Rice.
Colonel
Chamberlain.
That's
some
climb,
sir.
My
men
need
rations,
lieutenant.
Colonel
Rice
has
entrusted
me
to
tell
you
Relieved?
PITZER:
Fresh
troops
are
on
their
way
up
Colonel
Rice
wants
to
give
He
wants
you
to
fall
back,
Fall
back.
Yeah.
Ellis,
have
the
men
fall
in.
SPEAR:
Where
are
we
going?
Oh,
sir.
Lovely
spot.
Very
quiet.
Safest
place
on
the
battlefield.
Right
smack-dab
in
the
center.
Yes,
sir,
general.
We
will
attack
the
center.
But
I
think
you
are
right
about
the
flank.
Hood
and
McLaws
were
both
very
badly
I'll
give
you
two
other
divisions:
They
are
stronger
and
rested.
Now
you
will
have
nearly
three
divisions
Your
objective
will
be
The
attack
will
be
preceded
We'll
concentrate
all
of
our
guns
A
feu
d'enfer,
as
Napoleon
would
call
it.
When
the
artillery
has
had
its
effect,
You
will
have
nearly
15,000
men
You
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
But
plan
it
well.
We
stake
everything
on
this.
Sir,
with
your
permission.
Sir,
I've
been
a
soldier
all
my
life.
I
have
served
from
the
ranks
on
up.
I
must
tell
you
now,
No
15,000
men
ever
made
It's
a
distance
of
more
than
a
mile
When
the
men
come
out
of
the
trees
…
under
fire
of
Yankee
artillery
Those
are
Hancock's
boys.
And
now
they
have
the
stone
wall
We
do
our
duty,
general.
We
do
what
we
must
do.
Yes,
sir.
Colonel
Alexander
is
in
charge
We
will
depend
on
him
to
drive
them
off
And
the
men
will
know
what
to
do.
…
will
concentrate
squarely
on
the
center
The
line
is
not
strong
there.
General
Meade
has
great
strength
He
must
be
weak
in
the
center.
I
estimate
his
strength
in
the
center
And
Colonel
Alexander's
artillery
-
Yes,
sir.
What
are
you
thinking,
general?
Well,
sir…
…
Pickett's
division
is
from
my
corps.
But
the
other
two
units
Shouldn't
General
Hill
Say
again?
Shouldn't
General
Hill
lead
the
attack?
My
apologies,
sir.
I've
always
been
very
cautious.
Very
cautious.
There
is
no
one
I
trust
more.
Sir,
if
we
can
take
that
ridge…
We
can.
And
we
will.
General,
God
go
with
you.
George,
you
are
leading
attack.
Now
get
ready,
George.
Take
your
men
behind
the
line
of
trees.
Now,
move,
George!



Sir.
Forgive
me
the
torn
trousers,
sir.
Colonel
Alexander.
Those
Federal
cannon
up
on
that
I
want
you
to
assign
some
guns
Then…
…
you
move
forward
…
keeping
the
flanks
clear.
Porter,
how
old
are
you,
son?
-
Sir,
I'm
28,
sir.
Porter,
we
must
also
clear
those
guns
-
That's
the
main
thing.
LONGSTREET:
I'm
relying
on
you.
LONGSTREET:
I
want
you
to
use
everything
you
have.
Maximum
effort.
But
don't
open
up
till
I
give
the
word
Then
fire
with
all
you've
got.
Find
an
observation
point
We
must
clear
those
people
off
that
ridge.
If
we
don't…
Anyway,
you
let
me
know
when
you're
We
must
conserve
enough
to
support
Yes,
sir.
Gentlemen.
Johnston
Pettigrew,
Yeah,
I
know.
They
still
talk
about
your
grades
there
Your
reputation
as
a
scholar
I
hear
you've
written
a
book.
It
was
only
a
minor
work.
-
Surely.
Captain,
retrieve
my
book
General,
my
apologies,
but
I
do
not
believe
Gentlemen.
I
want
you
to
look
That
is
where
all
units
will
converge.
You
will
be
spread
out
in
a
long
line,
All
units
converging
on
that
point
Now,
look
here.
The
Yankee
center.
A
stone
wall.
A
small
grove
of
trees.
General
Trimble,
commanding
Pettigrew's
brigade
in
support.
General
Pickett's
division
And
now,
George,
…
and
one
in
back,
like
so.
Yes,
sir.
Garnett's
brigade.
That's
Jimmy
Kemper.
Armistead's
in
support.
Good.
All
right,
then.
Garnett
will
dress
off
at
Trimble's
flank.
And
he
will
be
the
hinge,
so
to
speak,
Somewhere
about
…
you
will
execute
your
first
left
oblique.
Then
direct.
Then
left
again.
And
so
on
at
your
own
discretion…
…
in
order
to
deceive
the
Yankees
Here.
Any
questions?
All
right,
gentlemen.
Gentlemen…
…
that
is
the
conversion
point.
We
will
use
all
of
the
artillery.
They
will
center
on
that
point,
Will
fire
every
gun
they
have
When
that
is
done,
Gentlemen…
…
I
do
believe
this
attack
will
decide
All
the
men
who
have
died
in
the
past
I
want
to
say,
sir,
it
is
an
honor
to
serve
I
want
to
thank
you,
sir,
for
giving
me
I
have
prayed,
sir.
George,
can
you
take
that
ridge?
Sir.
Harrison.
Would
you
mind
giving
someone
an
order
I
think
today
I'd
like
to
join
the
attack.
If
I
could
even
borrow
a
hat
from
a
soldier
Sir,
just
once.
Because
I
think,
sir,
Haven't
I
earned
it,
sir?
You
know
what's
gonna
happen?
I'll
tell
you
what's
gonna
happen.
Troops
are
now
forming
When
they
come
out,
they
will
be
under
Solid
shot.
Percussion.
Troops
will
come
out
under
fire
And
still,
within
the
open
field…
…
they'll
be
in

Thousands
of
little
bits
of
shrapnel
If
they
get
to
that
wall
…
there
won't
be
many
left.
A
mathematical
equation.
But
maybe,
just
maybe…
…
our
own
artillery
will
break
up
There's
always
that
hope.
That's
Hancock
out
there.
So
it's
mathematical
after
all.
If
they
get
to
that
road,
or
beyond
it,
But,
Harrison…

I
don't
believe
my
boys

Sir,
with
your
permission.
I'll
get
myself

sir.
That's
Meade's

You're
to
take
a
position
in
reserve.
You
don't
have
to
entrench,
LAWRENCE:
Major,
do
you
have
that?
PITZER:
You,
sir,
are
to
report

Hancock,
sir.
Chamberlain.
LAWRENCE:
I
hear
from
the
ranks
that
…
than
anyone
in
staff
has
told
me.
We
were
involved.
They
tell
me
It's
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of,
I'm
gonna
look
into
it.
We
need
fighting
men
in
this
army.
And
one
damn
thing
is
sure,
Meanwhile,
well
done.
Well
done.
LAWRENCE:
HANCOCK:
We
need
provisions.
We're
out.
HANCOCK:
I
want
you
to
write
a
report.
LAWRENCE:
HANCOCK:
They
say
you
are

That
seems
like

not

Three
years
or
three
lifetimes.

What
do
you
teach?
…
and
Natural
and
Revealed
Religion.
Now
you
tell
me,
professor.
Can
you
recall
a
story
from
antiquity
…
who
are
best
of
friends,
…
where
these
men
find
themselves,
…
on
opposing
sides
in
a
great
war?
Then,
on
a
given
day…
…
find
themselves
facing
one
another
If
the
Greeks
did
not
tell
of
such
a
story,
But,
sir,
I
think
it
must
be
found
There
isn't
an
officer
on
either
side…
…
who
hasn't
known
someone
wearing
But
this
morning…
…
I
looked
through
my
glass
…
of
the
9th
and
14th
Virginia
regiments
…
directly
facing
us,
right
over
there.
It
was
as
if
I
could
hear
his
voice…
…
see
his
old
crumpled
hat.
Armistead
commands
one
of
Pickett's
I
somehow
thought
this
day
I
thought
the
war
would
be
over
It's
three
years
and
how
many
more?
Who
could've
dreamed
What
would
you
do,
Chamberlain?
What
do
the
books
tell
you
to
do?
Now
you
go
and
rest
up.
Nothing's
gonna
happen
today
anyway.
Everybody's
too
tired,
too
hot,
Yes,
sir.
Thank
you
for
your
sentiments,
sir.

Lawrence.
I
just
got
back
from
the
hospital.
God-awful
mess.
They
got
no
room.
They
got
no
shade.
They're
cutting
off
arms
and
legs
They
ought
to
not
do
that
in
public.
Men
ought
to
have
some
privacy
You
see
Kilrain?
How
is
he?
Lawrence…
…
he
died.
He
died
this
morning
before
I
got
there.
A
couple
of
fellows
were
with
him.
He
said
to
tell
you
goodbye.
And
that
he
was
sorry.
Yeah.

I
tell
you,
Lawrence.
I
sure
was
fond
of
that
man.
Yeah.


SOLDIER:
General,
please
get
down.
There
are
times
when

GARNETT:
I'm
fine,
Dick.
Well,
that's
good.
How's
the
leg?
It's
all
right.
Can't
walk.
I'll
have
to
ride.
You
can't
do
that.
We're
going
up
there
today
When
the
Yankees
run
away,
there'll
be
And
maybe
we'll
win
it
today.
And
today
will
be
the
last
day.
Maybe
today.
I've
got
to
ride
up
there.
Well,
Lo…
…
I'll
see
you
at
the
top.

My
God,
Lo.
Ain't
it
marvelous?
I
thought
we
missed
it
all.
-
Any
questions?
PICKETT:
When
the
firing
ceases,
No
halting,
no
stopping
to
fire.
What
about
Garnett?
-
What
about
him?
Damnation.
George,
order
him
General
Armistead,
how
can
I
do
that?
General
Armistead,
sir.
My
compliments.
I
hope
Her
Majesty's
emissary
Slept
like
the
dead,
sir.
A
baby.
Slept
like
a
newborn
baby,
sir.
Lie
still,
men.
Keep
down.
There's
no
safe
place
here.
One
spot's
as
good
as
the
next.
MAN
1:
Fire!
We've
been
firing
for
a
good
while,
sir.
It's
apparent
neither
the
Federals
nor
we
If
we
continue
to
expend
our
ammunition
…
we
may
endanger
our
ability
Did
you
not
have
enough
ordinance
The
Federal
fire
compelled
us
to
remove
It's
taking
us
longer
to
refill
the
caissons.
Sir,
we
must
slow
down
our
fire
now…
…
or
we
will
have
to
cut
back
on
the
guns
Damn!
I'll
have
to
order
General
Pickett
to
halt
The
trains
have
a
little
ammunition.
In
the
meanwhile,
The
longer
we
delay…
…
the
more
time
the
Federals
have
And
even
if
we
recover
more
supplies
…
how
much
more
damage
can
we
inflict
They're
bringing
in
fresh
batteries
Just
get
some
more
ammunition
I
cannot
send
Pickett's
division
…
until
we
clear
some
of
those
guns
I'm
told
you
are
descended
Who
told
you
that?
Kemper?
He
tells
me
it
was
your
uncle
…
during
the
War
of
1812.
And
that
he
was
therefore
the
guardian
I
must
say,
Colonel
Fremantle.
It
does
not
begin
or
end
with
my
uncle
We're
all
sons
of
Virginia
here.
That
major
out
there
…
that's
James
Dearing.
First
in
his
class
at
West
Point,
And
the
boy
over
there
That's
Private
Robert
Tyler
Jones.
His
grandfather
was
The
colonel
behind
me,
Now,
his
great
grandfather…
…
was
the
Virginian
Patrick
Henry.
It
was
Patrick
Henry
"Give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death."
There
are
boys
here
from…
…
Norfolk…
…
Portsmouth…
…
small
hamlets
along
the
James
River.
From
Charlottesville
and
Fredericksburg.
The
Shenandoah
Valley.
Mostly
they're
all
veteran
soldiers
now.
The
cowards
and
shirkers
are
long
gone.
Every
man
here
knows
his
duty.
They
would
make
this
charge
They
know
the
gravity
of
the
situation.
And
the
mettle
of
their
foe.
They
know
that
this
day's
work…
…
will
be
desperate
and
deadly.
They
know
that
for
many
of
them…
…
this
will
be
their
last
charge.
But
not
one
of
them
needs
to
be
told
They
are
all
willing
to
make
…
to
achieve
victory
here.
The
crowning
victory
We
are
all
here.
You
may
tell
them
…
that
all
Virginia
was
here
on
this
day.
A
message
from
Alexander.

God's
sake,

General

General

is
down,

of

the
rest

I
do
hope
They
tell

that
it's

I
do
pray
God
that
it
is
not
the
case.
Is
there
anything
I
can
do?
There's
nothing
more
you
can
do
for
me.
But,
General
Lee,
will
you
see
to
it
…
who
made
this
charge
today?
I
will
do
so,
sir.
Thank
you,
general.
Thank
you,

It's
my
fault.


I
thought
we
were
invincible.
Friends.
It
is
all
my
fault.
Hear
me.
Hear
me,
I
pray
you.
It
is
entirely
my
fault.
No.
LEE:
Hear
me.
Please,
friends.
We
must
rest
now.
We
must
retire
And
there
will
be
another
day.
Meanwhile,
friends,
Never
let
them
see
you
run.
Never

The

We

better

Not

is
a
blessing.

it

It

What
