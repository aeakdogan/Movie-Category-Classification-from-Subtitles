...American
servicemen

Thanks,
Jane.
Preparations
for
a
high-/eve/
meeting
as
a
senate
delegation
made
ready
The
primary
purpose
of
the
talks
American
servicemen
are
still
being
In
recent
months,
American
veterans'
for
information
regarding
who
did
not
return
home
The
fate
of
these
Missing

Reported
sightings
of
foreign
have
resulted
in
greater
efforts

Senator
Maxwell
Porter,

expressed
guarded
optimism
in
shedding
some
light
But
we're
cautioned,
would
probably

You
give
off
bad
vibes,
Shocker!


Spider-Man,
we
meet
again!

I
love
reunions!

Here's
one,
Iceman!
Looks
like
I'll
have
to
settle
before
I
do
anything
else!
And
I
know
just
how
I'm
going
to
do
it!

Leaving?

Puny
insect!
My
vibro-shock

The
next
reunion
will
be
your
last!




Over
there!
Listen
to
me!

Shocker
returns

Spider
friends...
---Q0
for
it!
Let's
visit
a
maximum-security
prison!

It's
the
Shocker!
He's
making
a
break!

Spider-Man
put
me
in
that
hole

As
you
may
recall,
from
a
Vietnamese
prison
camp
and
has
he
was
held
was
not
Though
he
has
never
been
able
Braddock
has
been
one
of
the
most
that
American
prisoners
are
Braddock
has,
however,
to
speak
to
servicemen
's
organizations
and
has
completely
withdrawn
of
the
MIA
controversy.
The
American
delegation
had
hoped
would
increase
their
ability
This
is
Braddock.
I'll
go.
The
Vietnamese
government
The
people
in
these
photos
Including
American
MIAs.
Now,
listen,
even
our
own
experts
agree
You
can
imagine
We're
gonna
need
something
if
we're
gonna
make
Isn't
that
why
Colonel
Braddock
Some
piece
of
irrefutable
evidence.
Just
look
at
the
way
Who
am
I
trying
to
impress,
Senator?

Senator
Porter,
I
am
General
Tran.
Welcome
to
the
It's
a
pleasure,
General.
I'd
like
to
introduce
you
to
-
Miss
Fitzgerald,
welcome.
Colonel
James
Braddock.
Ah,
Colonel
Braddock,
Welcome
to
the
Colonel!
Excuse
me.
You're
a
goddamn
embarrassment,
That's
why
I'm
here,
Senator.
Something
I've
been
wondering.
I
mean,
we
must've
asked
you
20
times.
I've
got
my
reasons.


What's
wrong?
Nothing's
wrong.
-
So
nice
to
have
you
with
us.
Senator
Porter,
we
all
know
that
only
in
an
attempt
That's
not
true,
General.
But
I
believe
that
once
for
his
extended
imprisonment
the
world
will
take
Miss
Fitzgerald.
-

Colonel
Braddock...
-
General!
-
Excuse
me,
General,
sir...



These
people
were
eyewitnesses
committed
by
Colonel
Braddock


Innocent
women,
children


You
have
their
sworn
statements



What
did
he
say?
He
said
he
understands
and
it's
OK.
Colonel
Braddock...
there
was
a
price
on
your
head
It
was
more
like
$20,000.
What?
Why
don't
you
tell
us
For
your
war
crimes,
of
course.
-
For
killing
assholes
like
you.
-
Colonel!

The
atrocities,
were
the
real
reasons
He
was
not
a
prisoner
of
war,
-

Been
Thanks.
I
see
you've
come
up
in
the
world.
You
got
out
You
might
not
be
so
lucky
this
time.

Tran
is
up
in
arms
about
Porter
called
Washington
And
the
President
is
outraged...
Ah,
Miss
Fitzgerald,
Uh,
Colonel
Braddock,
there
is
a
Is
it
true
that
you
let
all
because
you
alone
refused
You
are
the
most
undiplomatic
man
I'm
not
running
for
office.
Besides,
Oh.
Well,
let's
see.
James
Thomas
Braddock,
38
years
old.
Colonel
in
the
Army
Special
Forces.
Prisoner
of
war
for
eight
months.
Missing
in
action
for
seven
years,
And
you
are
now
in
Saigon
to
see
if
there
are
Like
I
said,
How
about
a
nightcap?
Yeah,
sure.

Oh,
yeah.
Been
quite
a
day.
Yeah.
It
should
be
quite
a
night,
too.
Now,
look,
Braddock,
just
because...
-
Just
what
do
you
think
you're
doing?

Would
you
mind?
I
don't
believe
this.
Look,
Braddock,
I
invited
you
up
here
Jim!
What
the
hell
is
this?
I'm
gonna
take
a
look
around
Saigon.
We
are
not
supposed
to
leave
Jim,
do
you
hear
me?
I
won't
be
gone
long.
I'm
supposed
to
be
keeping
you

Shit.
Braddock,
don't.
How
are
you
gonna
FIY-

Bastard.
-









Keep
your
eyes
shut...
...and
listen
very
carefully.
The
answer
you
give
me...
...will
decide
whether
you
live
or
die.
-
And
I'll
know
if
you're
lying
Now,
where
are
the
American
MIAs?
I
don't
know.

Don't
do
it!
There
is
a
camp.
-
Delta
region.
Dong
Ha.
Dong
Ha.
Eight
kilometers
from
the
coast.

No,
don't!
Don't!
Spare
me!
I
gave
you
the
information.
I
gave
it.
That's
all
I
know.
Don't...
If
you
move...
...I'll
kill
you.


















I
suppose
he's
been
here
That's
right.
How
very
convenient.
Yes,
isn't
it?
You...
You
leave
tomorrow...
...or
you'll
not
leave
at
all.
I
wish
you
didn't
have
to
go.
Nothing
I
can
do
here.
Jim,
why
Bangkok?
I
have
to
look
up
a
friend.
An
old
army
buddy.

Be
careful.

He

friend.
His

Tucker.
Jack

I
think...
maybe
I
have
heard
of
him.

Thanks.
Come

How's
it
going,
Tuck?
Braddock.
-
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
Oh,
shit.
We'd
better
talk
later.
It's
important.
How
much?
Five
grand.
-
Four
grand!
Two!
-
Did
you
say
one
thousand?
Yeah,
a
thousand
bucks.
That's
what
I
thought
you
said.
What
the
hell
do
you
need
We're
going
back
to
Nam
Oh,
shit,
Braddock.
You're
crazy.
You
said
"we."
You
owe
me,
Tuck.
I
need
your
help.
Yeah,
I
owe
you.
More
than
once.
All
right,
you
bastard.
But
I'm
not
going

OK?
OK.

Getting
in
is
no
problem.
I've
been
smuggling
cigarettes
My
new
Southern
Belle's

of
the
There
she
is.
What
the
hell
is
that?
Like
my
daddy
always
said,
Discourages
pirates.
I'll
show
you
something
back
here.
They're
Detroit
diesels.
We
can
hit
21
knots
if
we
have
to.
M-16s,
grenades,
C-4,
LAW.
You're
playing
for
keeps.
What
the
hell
do
you
need
The
camp's
in
the
delta.
How
come
you
never
mention
If
we
can
hit
the
camp
without
raising
-
That's
nice.
And
if
not?
Great.
Look,
you
wanna
do
me
a
favor?
Next
time
I
ask
you
something
you
don't
tell
me
nothing,
OK?
-
There
is
something
else.
We
could
use
a
long-range
chopper
Now
how
in
hell
are
we
supposed
We'll
think
of
something.

Gentlemen,
even
the
M-16s,
but
not
the
raft.
Bullshit,
Carlos.
Got
one?
Sure,
I
got
one.
But
have
you
got
the
money?
Let's
see
the
sucker
first,
There
she
is.
Yang!
Quite
a
unique
weapon,
eh?
She
can
run
60
miles
an
hour,
no
one
can
hear
you
coming.
Yeah,
too
bad
a
single
bullet'll
Yang.
It's
Kevlar.
Very
expensive.
Same
material
your
bulletproof
vests
It
will
stop
anything,
How
much?
Twenty
thousand
American
dollars...
The
rifles
and
ammunition...
...I
throw
in,
free.
Five.
Don't
be
ridiculous.
There
is
nothing
like
her
-
Seven.
Fifteen.
No
less.
Ten.
Deal.
-

are
you
willing
to
pay?
I
didn't
figure
it
was
free.
-
OK,
then.
What
about
the
marking?
US?
Just
make
sure
I
can
count
on
the
pilot.
Look
around,
my
friend.
In
this
place,
you
can
count
on


-











Braddock!
Hey,
hop
in!
Come
on,
we're
leaving
early.
Get
dressed.
AW...
Shit.



Mike,
cast
off!










You
shouldn't
have
hurt

Fortunes
of
war.
Yeah.


Fortunes
of
war.
Well,
there
she
is...
Vietnam.
Pearl
of
the
Orient.
If
I'm
not
back
in
12
hours,
You're
crazy,
Braddock.
Maybe.
What
happens
if
you
have
to
fight
I'll
figure
something
out.
You
already
have.
You
son
of
a
bitch!
Goddammit!
You
knew
there
was
no
way
once
we
got
here,
didn't
you?
Let's
get
one
thing
straight!
I'm
only
here
to
operate
the
damn
raft!
I'm
not
getting
outta
Give
us
14
hours!
If
I
don't
make
it
back,

Come
on,
Tuck.
No.
You
promised
me
What
do
we
need
that
for,
anyway?
If
we're
lucky.
If
not,
I
don't
think
to
swim
out
to
the
boat.
Tuck.




Aah!



Aah!
Sorry.
Won't
happen
again.
-
Do
we
run
or
fight?
The
camp
is
about
one
klick
I'll
go
the
rest
of
the
way
on
foot.
Thanks
for
coming
this
far.
-
Did
I
have
a
choice?

Watch
your
ass!

















Sergeant
Dinh,
Black
Panther
Rangers.
-
You
are
after
the
Americans?
They
moved
less
than
three
hours
ago,
Do
you
know
which
road
they
took?
There
is
only
one
road
It
follows
the
river
all
the
way.
-
You
are
going
after
them?
Thank
you.
Thank
you.



Tuck!
-
Tuck!
-
Where's
our
people?
-
Shit!


There
it
is!




Aah!

Braddock?
Is
it
safe?


Holy
Christ.
You
guys
are
going
home.

We're
going
home?
Damn
right!
Give
me
your
hand.
We're
going
home!

Come
on!
Get
to
the
Jeep!
Get
in!
Come
on!
Get
in!
OK,
Braddock!
-
How
far
to
the
coast?
Pray
the
boat's
still
there.
Take
'em
to
the
river!
I'll
catch
up.

Out
you
90-
Keep
it
goin'!
Keep
it
goin'!



Two
klicks
to
the
coast.
We'll
make
it.
Come
on!
Come
on!
Come
on!

Come
on!
Move
it!
Come
on!
The
boat!
Keep
moving
there!
Keep
goin'
now!
-

Keep
moving!
Come
on!


Come
on!

Come
on!
Patrol
boat!

Get
back!
Go
back
to
the
shore!
I'll
see
you
in
hell!
Tuck!
Take
it
down!


Aah!

Hurry
up!



-
Where
to?
Oh,
shit!
If
I
knew
it
would
be
like
this,
I
wouldn't
rent
you
the
helicopter
My
government
is
extremely
gratified
to
be
able
to
put
this
issue
to
rest,

In
conclusion,
then...

...we
categorically
deny...

...that
there
are
any
