-
Thanks
for
the
ride.
What's
the
deal?
Get
going,
Are
you
working
or
what?
Yeah,
I'll
be
at
the
station
all
day.
-
All
right.
After
that,
we're
on
double
time.
-
Triple.
You
think
they'd
take
it
down.
Come
on,
bud.
-
What?
I
do.
-
I
think
you're
lying.
-
I
never
know
when
to
believe
your
mouth.
-
Later,
bud.
-
So,
did
you
do
your
history?
MR.
TEASDALE:
And
the
great
hunt
with
the
armies
spread
out
I
would
say
about
the
size
of
Rhode
Island.
Then
they
would
ride
forward,
Beasts,
men,
even
bugs.
Now,
the
ends
would
kind
of
Everything
within
that
circle
When
the
Mongols
could
see
each
other
they
had
worked
themselves
up
Now,
when
this
killing
started,
it'd
last
for
days,
weeks,
even
months.
And
it
went
on
until
the
young
son
of
the
Khan
asked
his
father
be
allowed
to
go
free.
Well,
now,
my
friend.
-
Well,
now.
BOY
1:
Check
it
out.
BOY
1:
They
look
pretty
cool
though,
man.
MR.
TEASDALE:
I
would
say
This
is
very
unusual.

Then
do
something,
Mr.
Teasdale.


What's
going
on,
my
friend?

Daryl,
come
on.
Let's
go.
Get
in!
Get
down,
get

-
Get

Everybody

Run!
Get

Stay

Arturo!

Papa!
Papa!

Get

ROBERT:
Dad!
Dad!
-
Dad,
they're
in
town.
They
were
shooting
at
me!

We're
going
to
the
mountains.
MR.
MORRIS:
Who
are
they,
BOY:
I
heard
some
of
them
-
Did
you
see
any
of
them?
MR.
MORRIS:
Who
are
they?
-
BOY:
Come
on,
man,
just
relax.
BOY:
Just
take
it
easy.
Get
in
there
and
get
sleeping
bags
Come
on.
-
Let's
move
it!
Take
the
dry
stuff.
Don't
Got
it.
Yeah.
-
What
should
I
get?
-
.308.
.38
Specials.
Grab
some
toilet
paper.
MR.
MORRIS:
The.22's.
Carry
a
lot
of
that.
Take
a
lot
of
batteries,
boys.
There's
a
shotgun
there.
JED:
Get
those
down
jackets.
Matt,
look!
Get
down!
Get
down!

Lay
down!
Is
it
ours?
-
I
love
you,
boy.
-
Tell
Mom
I
love
her.
I'll
take
care
of
him.
All
right,
come
on,
boys,
Come
on.
Don't
come
back
here.
No
matter
what
you
see
or
hear,
I'll
come
and
get
you
soon
enough.
Open
the
glove
compartment.
-
Is
it
there?
Load
it.
It's
already
loaded.
Give
it
here.
-
Want
these
also,
Jed?
JED:
Oh,
Jesus
Christ!
Oh,

Oh,

I'm
gonna
turn
off
quick.
ROBERT:
It's
a
helicopter!
It's
ours!
Get
in!
Get
in!
-
Get
it?
That's
got
it.
Only
thing
is
we
got
one
problem.
How
about
pissing
in
it?
-
That's
a
good
idea.
Get
up
here.
How
old
are
you,
kid?
Fifteen.
And
the
name's
Danny,
not
kid.
Well,
when
you
grow
up,
Now
get
up
here
and
piss
in
the
radiator.


We've
got
Yankee
tanks
We've
lost
most
of
our
night
vision
and
have
only
a
few
anti-tank
missiles
left
Put
your
best
men
into
hunter
groups
Keep
100
meters
between
each
group,
wait
until
the
Yankees
approach
to
strike,
find
out
from
where
they
attack,
then
Yes,
Mr.
Bella.
I
want
some
anti-aircraft
here.
We're
working
on
it,
sir.
This...
This
is
a
madhouse!

Do
you
want
to
see
me?

Yes,
yes.
From
the
files
obtain
forms
4473.
These
will
contain
and
lists
of
private
ownership.
DANNY:
But
our
families,
huh?
ROBERT:
We
gotta
stay
up
here
I
just
wanna
go
home.
I
don't
wanna
hide.
Check
it
out.
Stopped
a
bullet
I
got
these.
Those'll
do
us
a
lot
of
good.
We've
got
no
radio.
I
mean,
how
long
do
you
think
on
olives
and
Rice
Krispies?
What
else
are
we
gonna
do?
As
Calumet
Student
Body
President,
I
forward
the
motion
I
second
the
motion.
We
can't
stay
here.
Sit
down,
Danny.
You're
not
going
anywhere.
-
I
say
we
vote
on
it.
This
isn't
the
big
game,
Mr.
Quarterback.

No.
You're
such
a
goddamn
jock!
Hey.
Come
on,
guys.
Knock
it
off!

You
want
to
go
so
bad.
That
goes
for
the
rest
of
you.
This
is
your
chance.
Get
walking.
It
is
World
War
III
down
there.
People
are
being
killed.
Those
could
be
Russians.
Jed?
What
about
your
family,
huh?
I
don't
know.
But
I'm
alive.
And
I'm
staying
here.
My
family
would
want
me
to
stay
alive.
Your
family
would
want
you
to
stay
alive.
You
think
you're
so
smart,
man.
What
do
you
think
you
are?
Alone,
I
guess.
No,
you're
not.
Here,
bud.
What
do
you
say?
I'm
with
you.
JED:
All
right.
The
rest
of
you
get
going.
All
right,
but
if
you
stay
you're
gonna
do
exactly
what
I
say,
okay?
-
Huh?
So
come
on
over
here
and
get
warm.
Daryl.
Sorry.
Me
too,
man.
Okay.
Now,
Matt
and
I've
been
coming
up
to
these
We
can
hunt,
we
can
fish,
Okay?
How
long,
Jed?

Till
we
don't
hear
that
no
more.
I
got
him!
You
got
him.
-
Gonna
eat
good...
Never
shoot
twice.
Shoot
twice,
they
can
find
you.
He's
dead,
anyway.
How
do
you
know?
I
used
to
read
a
lot
about
The
Blackfeet,
if
you
shot
twice,
My
dad
named
me
after
Jed
Smith.
This
is
your
first
time,
isn't
it?
Yeah.
What?
You
gotta
drink
if
it's
your
first.
We
did.
What's
it
taste
like?
It's
not
too
bad.
It's
kinda
salty
like
a
steak
or
You
gotta
do
it.
It's
the
spirit
of
the
deer.
When
you
drink
it,
you'll
be
a
real
hunter.
Bottoms
up.
Go.
Go
ahead.
Go.
Go
for
it,
buddy.
All
right.
All
right.
You
did
it.
His
blood
is
yours.
You
know,
there's
gonna
be
something
It
wasn't
so
bad.
It
wasn't
that
bad.
Wasn't
so
bad.
That's
the
last
of
it,
except
for
the
olives.
We've
still
got
plenty
of
meat
left.
Just
stuff
you
shot.
So
tell
me,
dork,
where
do
you
suppose
Nobody
shoots
them.
We
need
food.
We
need
to
know.
Yeah.
We
do.
All
right.
We'll
go
into
town.
JED:
Jesus.
There's
no
one
in
here,
either.
It's
like
it's
been
here
for
1,000
years.

Come
on.
Hey!
The
stores
are
open.
There's
people
everywhere.
Hey,
hey,
hey!
-
Don't
go
anywhere.
You
can't
tell
from
here,
Jed.
MATT:
Jesus
Christ.
-
I've
never
seen
a
tank
like
that
before.
ROBERT:
Yeah,
but
they're
packed.
JED:
Let's
stash
our
stuff.
-
Leave
it
all
here,
okay?
That's
the
mayor's
car.
They
got
Daryl's
dad's
car.
-
Look
at
the
size
of
that
tank.
MATT:

Louis.
Was
he
scared
of
us?
Let's
ask
Alicia.
She'll
know.
Six
toothbrushes,
please.
-
Oh,
Jed.
-
What?
Where'd
you
come
from?
Are
you
crazy?
You
gotta
get
out
of
here.
We
will,
but
first
You
don't
understand.
They
know
who
all
of
you
are.
-
Who?
-
The
Russians?
The
Cubans.
Look,
have
you
seen
my
father?
I
called,
there
was
no
answer.
I
went
by
the
station,
it
was
empty...
Okay,
listen.
I'm
gonna
tell
you
something
Nobody
is,
but...
But
what?
They
took
a
lot
of
people
away.
People
that
they
thought
People
that
had
guns
or
things
Where?
Re-education
camps.
The
drive-in.
I
heard
they
took
I
pray
for
you.
MAN
ON
PA:
America
is
a
whorehouse
where
the
revolutionary
ideals
are
corrupted
and
sold
in
alleys
You
grow
fat

-
Hey.
Could
you
find
my
dad,
Tom
Eckert?
-
Jed?
Matt?
Laddie,
I'll
go
find
your
dad.
You
know
Morris'
Market?
The
one
on
the
highway.
I'll
look
around
for
him,
too.

Daddy?
It's
all
right.
I
can
stand
up.
Boys.
Daddy.
Jed...
MATT:
Daddy...
Don't
talk.
Don't
say
anything.
Yeah,
I
knew
I
was
right.
I
knew
it.
You're
alive.
I
was
tough
on
both
of
you.
I
did
things
that
made
you,
made
you
hate
me
sometimes.
You
understand
now,
don't
you?
What
happened,
Dad?
Doesn't
matter.
One
way
or
another,
one
reason
or
another,
we're
all
gone.
It's
all
gone.
Remember...
Remember
when
you
used
to
And
I
used
to
put
you
on
the
swings,
and
both
of
you
were
so
damn
little
that...
I
remember.
I
remember
all
of
it.
Well,
I
ain't
gonna
be
around
Both
of
you
got
to
We'll
never
see
you
again,
Dad.
Yes,
you
will.
What
happened
to
Mom?
Where
is
she?
We
can't
afford
to
be
crying
anymore
now.
I
don't
want
either
of
you
Don't

it.
Not

long
as

live.
Where's
my
dad,
Mr.
Eckert?
I
don't
know,
son.
I

You

get
going
now.
Get

you.
Dad,
I
love
you.

you
do,
Son.
I
love
you,
too.
Boys!

me!

I'll
be
damned.

sees
you.

you.

Wait

I

you,

A

Mr.

we
can't
take
this.
That's
all
right.
I

Now,
you
boys
listen
to
me.
Don't
go
to
Calumet
no
more.
How
come?
Because
there's
been
People
waking
up
with
their
throats
cut.
-
Word
has
it,
it's
you.
What
happened
to
my
dad
and
mom?
Your
daddy's
dead,
Robert.
They
shot
him.
The
Russians
found
some
guns
missing,
so
they
shot
him
for
aiding
guerillas.
What
do
you
mean
'"aiding
guerillas'"?
-
We
took
the
stuff.
They
killed
him,
son.
Now,
you
boys
listen
to
me
I
don't

I
ain't
got

Daryl.

your

Yes.
Well,
he
is
a

No,
you
see,
Daryl
is

A

Yes,
but
that's
not
military.
Now
look,
Colonel,
if
he's
alive,
and
he's
just
as
anxious
to
avoid
conflicts
He's
not
a
troublemaker.
Then
who
is?
Well,

say

a
'"Wolverine'"?

A
small
animal
like
a
badger,
but
terribly
ferocious.
It
is
also
the
name
They're
beasts,
Ernesto.
You
must
kill
It's
the
same
as
Afghanistan.
They'll
never
stop.
Look,
I
was
always
I
have
no
experience
in
these
matters
but
it
would
seem
necessary
As
our
opponents
used
to
say
'"Win
their
hearts
and
minds.'"
And
they
lost,
Ernesto...
That
is
true,
General.
Things
are
paralyzed
at
the
front,
Ernesto.
Morale
is
crucial
right
now.
Keep
the
men
in
the
secured
areas.
You'll
see
how
they
forget

Are
you
alright?
Yes,
go
and
check.
You
were
saying,
comrade?
Shut
up.
Doctor!

Get
a
doctor...

You
American?
Red-blooded.
Yeah,
what's
the
capital
of
Texas?
Austin.
Wrong,
commie!
It's
Houston.
Please,
darling.
I'm
cold.
You've
seen
too
many
movies.
Well,
you
hungry?
I
could
eat,
yeah.
What
kind
of
plane
you
fly?
Well,
I
did
fly
an
F-15.
Here.
I'm
an
Eagle
driver.
Here,
take
this.
I
got
this
off
a
dead
Russian
Major.
-
Major,
huh?
I
guess
it
ought
to
fit
on
a
Colonel.
You
the
honcho,
sport?
Who
are
you?
Andrew
Tanner,
Lieutenant
Colonel,
How
did
you
It
was
five
to
one.
I
got
four.
I'm
Jed.
How
are
you
doing,
Jed?
Good
as
can
be.
West
coast.
East
coast.
Down
here
is
Mexico.
First
wave
of
the
attack
came
in
same
way
they
did
in
Afghanistan
in
'80.
Only
they
were
crack
airborne
outfits.
They
took
these
passes
in
the
Rockies.
So
that's
what
hit
Calumet.
I
guess
so.
They
coordinated
and
their
missiles
were
hell
of
a
lot
They
took
out
silos
here
in
the
Dakotas
-
and
key
points
of
communication.
Oh,
like
Omaha,
Washington,
Kansas
City.
Gone?
-
Yeah,
that's
right.
Infiltrators
came
up
illegal
from
Mexico.
Cubans,
mostly.
They
managed
to
infiltrate
SAC
bases
in
the
Midwest,
Wreaked
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
havoc.
They
opened
up
the
door
down
here
and
the
whole
come
walking
right
through,
rolled
right
up
here
How
far
did
they
get?
Cheyenne
across
to
Kansas.
We
held
them
at
the
Rockies
Anyway,
the
Russians
reinforced
Sent
three
whole
army
groups
Cut
the
pipeline,
came
across
Canada
But
we
stopped
their
butt
cold.
Lines
have
pretty
much
stabilized
now.
What
about
Europe?
I
guess
they
figured
twice
in
one
century
was
enough.
They're
sitting
this
one
out.
All
except
England.
They
won't
last
very
long.
The
Russians
need
to
take
us
in
one
piece.
That's
why
they
won't
use
nukes
anymore
Not
on
our
own
soil.
The
whole
damn
thing's
Who
knows?
What
started
it?
I
don't
know.
Sooner
or
later
they're
gonna
fight.
That
simple?
Maybe
somebody
forgot
what
it
was
like.
Who
is
on
our
side?
Six
hundred
million
screaming
Chinamen.
Last
I
heard,
There
were.
You
got
a
family?
I
don't
know.
They
got
caught
behind
the
lines
I
like
to
think
they're
alive,
but
I
hear
stories
Colonel.
-
Get
up.
We're
taking
off,
we're
gonna
go
Let's
go.
Early
bird
gets
the
worm.
Early
bird
gets
the
worm.
Watch
those
claymores
in
the
trees.
Matt,
RPG!
Now,
what
do
you
think?
Your
mom
would
be
real
proud.
AND
Y:
You
think
you're
tough
There's
half
a
million
scarecrows
in
Denver
would
give
anything
They've
been
under
siege
They
live
on
rats
and
sawdust
bread
on
each
other.
At
night
the
pyres
for
the
dead
light
up
the
sky.
It's
medieval.
All
that
hate's
gonna
burn
you
up,
kid.
Keeps
me
warm.
Colonel,
are
we
doing
right?
You've
made
a
new
friend.

Yeah.
She
doesn't
say
much,
does
she?
No.
Something
happened
to
her.
All
right,
plane,
plane,
plane,
plane.
Cuban
bunker,
Russian
bunker,
Machine
gun
bunkers
here,
Back
here
by
the
drive-in
screen
All
right.
We'll
cause
a
diversion
over
here,
fire
on
these
machine
gun
positions.
The
B-group
comes
across
this
area
When
you
reach
this
bunker
you
lay
down
grazing
fire
on
this
duffle-A.
I
think
that's
pretty
simple.
Anybody
got
any
questions
so
far?
What's
a
flank?
ERICA:
A
duffle-A?
Yeah.
What's
grazing
fire?
-
I
need
a
drink.
MAN
ON
PA:
Step
into
the
line

Help!
Listen
to
me,
Follow
me
quickly.
Hurry,
hurry!
ROBERT:
Wolverines!
Move!
Take
it!
Go!
-
Come
on!
Come
on!
Here's
your
chance!
Move!
We're
all
gonna
die!
Die
standing
up!
Grenade!

GENERAL:

Children
did
this.
It's
rebels.
What
rebels?
They're
bandits.
Every
time
they
shoot,
I
know.
I
was
a
partisan.
And
now
what
are
you?
Now
I'm
like
you,
a
policeman.
All
right,
Colonel!
All
right.
And
he's
down.
Great
play
by
Matt
Eckert.
All
right.
-
Huddle
up,
folks.
JED:
That's
a
pretty
good
catch.
ROBERT:
You
cover
Matt
in
this
play.
Are
you
okay?
It's
hard
down
on
the
ground,
isn't
it?
-
Yeah.
Come
down
here.
How
old's
your
wife?
How
old's
your
wife?
Eighty.
What's
she
like?
Old
like
me.
What's
she
really
like?
Feisty.
Like
you.
Where
did
you
meet
her?
You
really
wanna
know
this
stuff?
Yeah.
I
met
her
in
a
closet
at
a
party.
Couldn't
stand
her
at
first.
But
once
it
took,

I
loved
her
so
bad,
it
hurt.
Still
love
her
like
that?
Are
you
quitters
playing
or
what?
No!
Fine.
-
Come
on!
They
brought
their
kids.
They
didn't
have
food
They
want
to
give
them
to
you,
Jed.
This
is
enough,
Mr.
Mason.
You're
a
leader
now.
They've
heard
of
you
on
the
other
side.
Maybe
all
the
way
to
California.
And
there
are
some
that
say
in
the
spring,
to
help
you
out.
Green
Berets.
Spring's
a
long
time
away.
It's
a
lot
of
talk
until
then.


It's
ours!
It's
ours!
How
can
you
tell?
It's
ours.
Yeah.
Fry
'em.
Jesus.
You
gotta
cross
that.
Just
part
of
it.
Hope
our
guys
are
still
there.
So
this
is
a
battlefield.
It's
a
real
war,
kid.
It's
here
every
day.
Come
with
me,
Jed.
You
can
quit
now.
Could
you?
Don't
give
me
that
crap.
Wake
up
in
the
morning.
Grow
old.
Move
it!
Come
on!
Move
it!
Get
down!
Down!
Down!
Down!
Stay
down!
He
can't
see
us!
DANNY:
He's
looking
for
us!
Sure
is.

I
can't
stand
it!
Get
down!
-
Get
down,
get
down!
Get
down!

All
right,
run!
Everybody
get
out
of
here!
What
are
you
doing?
God
damn
it!
Christ.

MATT:
Coming
up
there!

I
got
him!
Get
out
of
here,
Jed!
-
Get
out!
JED:
Take
him
out
with
the
RPG,
man!
ROBERT:
Give
me
another
rocket!
Aardvark!
Eat
me!

No!
No!
Come
on,
buddies,
come
and
get
them!
Shoot
straight
for
once,
you
army
pukes.
No!
It's
useless.
He's
dead!
Let's
go!
Go!
Go!

I'll
never
love
anybody.
I'll
never
love
anybody
again.
If
you
didn't
love
anybody,
Where
are
we
gonna
bury
him?
What's
left
to
bury?
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.
These
were
good
friends.
Take
them
away
from
here.
Someplace
safe
where
this
war's
never
happened.
And
as
we
remember,
please
let
them
forget,
O
Lord,
so
they
can
be
little
again.
Amen.
MATT:

Jed.

Jed.
What
are
you
whispering
for?
Feels
quiet.
You
should
get
some
sleep.
It's
getting
late.
I'm
okay.
It's
kind
of
strange,
isn't
it?
How
the
mountains
You
laugh
or
you
cry,
the
wind
just
keeps
on
blowing.
It
was
bound
to
happen
sooner
or
later.
You're
getting
pretty
lean
on
feelings,
Can't
afford
them.
Even
if
that
had
been
me?
I
was
talking
to
the
group,
Jed.
Doesn't
look
good.
Seems
like
they
lost
the
stomach
for
it.
Except
for
Robert.
And
you?
I'm
your
brother.
Just
make
it
count.


Attention!

Be
seated,
comrades.
What
I
despise
most
about
warfare
I've
heard
euphemisms
that
our
sector
of
pacification
is
growing.
These
are
the
tactics
of
the
lie.
Lies
have
the
stench
of
death
and
defeat.
You
can
only
win
a
war
Do
you
know
who
we
are
fighting?
We
are
fighting
wolverines,
small
ferocious
animals.
For
them
you
need
a
hunter.
And
you
know,
I
am
a
hunter.
From
this
moment
on,
there
will
be
no
further
reprisals
That
was
stupid.
Impotence.
Comrades,
if
a
fox
stole
your
chickens,
would
you
slaughter
your
pig
You
would
hunt
the
fox,
find
where
it
lives
and
destroy
it.
And
how
do
we
do
this?
Become
a
fox.





Danny,
bolt's
open.
It's
jammed.
Danny.
Hey.

So
what
if
he
does?
You
don't.
We
better
get
out
of
here.

Shoot
him!
What
is
this
thing?
What
is
it?
Who's
coming
after
us?
Where
are
they?
Rub
a
butt
on
him.


Suck
at
you!
I
hear
a
chopper
and
Go
die,
Yankee!
Die!
God
damn,
you
son
of...
Gorsky,
Stepan
Yevgenyvitch.
Suck
it.
No
one
gives
a
damn
who
you
are!
-
They're
gonna
hurt
him!
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey!
Look!
This
thing's
got
an
arrow.
It's
pointing.
It's...
Where?
Where?
Where?
Right
here.
Daryl.


Where
is
it?
Where
is
it?
God
damn
it,
where's
the
bug?
-
They
made
me
swallow
it.
I
went
into
town.
And
got
caught.
And
went
and
got
caught!
Why?
Because
you
said
we
couldn't.
ROBERT:
You
told
them
You
told
them!
My
father
turned
me
in.
Oh,
God,

You
son
of
a
bitch!
You
want
blindfolds?
This
violate
the
Geneva
Convention.
I
never
heard
of
it!
Dogface!
I
show
you
how
Soviet
dies!
I've
seen
it
before,
pal.
This
isn't
happening!
This
isn't
happening!
-
Jed,
let
him
go!
-
He
was
one
of
us!
He
told
them
where
we
were!
He
did.
-
Now,
get
your
rifles.
What
did
you
say?
I
said
no!
We're
not
doing
it!
Boy,
say
that
you
are
friend
so
I
will
not
die
alone.
What's
the
difference,
Jed,
huh?
-
I'll
do
it.
Tell
me,
what's
the
difference
Because
we
live
here!

Don't
shoot.
Don't
shoot.
Don't
shoot
me,
Jed.
Don't
shoot
me,
Jed.




How
many
of
those
you
got
left?
Four.
Ready.
No,
wait.
Don't.
Stop.
What
do
you
say?
You
hungry?
Yeah.

JED:

Go,
Toni.


JED:
Let's
get
it
fast
Come
on.
It's
been
so
long.

Quiet,
quiet,
quiet!


TONI:
Oh,
my
God.
ROBERT:
Holy
shit!
Get
down!
ERICA:
Toni!
Stay
down!
-
Let's
get
out
of
here!
Go.
Come
on.
Get
on.
Come
on.
Yeah.
Come
on!
JED:
Come
on,
let's
go!
Go
on!
Go
on!
Toni!
Toni!
Wolverines!
I'm
killed,
Jed.
Don't
let
them
get
me.
Because
they'll
make
me
talk.
Where's
your
gun?
I
want
you
to
do
it.

I
can't.

I
can't,
Toni.
I
can't.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Give
me
your
grenade.
I
don't
wanna
be
too
cold.
Pull
the
pin
for
me.
I'm
just
gonna
stay
here
and
listen
to
the
wind
a
while,
okay?
Go.

Comrade
Colonel.
I
would
estimate
enemy
body
count
at
12.
Twelve...
Wouldn't
you
agree?
Twelve.
Twelve.
I
saw
only
one.
But
they
carry
off
their
dead.
Of
course,
why
not?
Why
do
you
think
they
are
so
cruel?

All
right,
now,
listen
to
me.
You
two
are
gonna
wait
up
here
You'll
know
when
that
happens.
When
they
do,
head
out
for
the
plains.
What
about
you?
I
gotta
stick
around.
Stir
things
up,
so
you
can
make
it
out.
-
We're
going
with
you,
Mattie.
-
We're
going
with
you.
We
are
all
that's
left.
Someone's
gotta
live.
Me
and
Jed,
we're
all
used
up.
No.

I'm
never
gonna
forget.
As
long
as
I
live.
Never
forget.
Don't.
Matt.
You're
never
gonna
know
who
won.
We
will.
You
know,
we
could
make
it,
Jed.
We've
been
a
lot
tougher
than
this
before.
We
cause
a
diversion,
get
out
of
here,
I
love
you,
Mattie.
I
know.
I
love
you,
too,
Jed.
It's
hard
being
brothers,
isn't
it?
Yeah.
Let's
go.

I
can't
remember
It
seems
a
thousand
years
How
did
I
come
to
this
high,
where
there
is
nothing
but
loneliness?
So
much
is
lost
I
want
to
look
in
your
eyes
and
forget
It
all
seems
so
far
away
A
warm
house
your
long,
black
hair
in
my
hands
There
is
no
more
revolution,
only
you
to
come
back
to
I
will
post
my
resignation







Come
on!
Let's
go,
let's
go!







They're
attacking

Everybody
to
the
station!



Hurry,
hurry!

You
lose.


You
can
rest
now.
Just
hang
on,
Matt.
Oh,
Matt.
It's
okay,
Matt.
It's
okay.
Just
hang
on,
Matt.
Hang
on,
Matt.
Come
on,
Matt.
Daddy
will
be
here
soon.
It's
okay.
Come
on,
Matt.
I'll
hold
you
as
long
as
I
can,
Matt.
I'll
hold
you
as
long
as
I
can.
You
can
lean
on
me.
I'm
so
tired.
So
tired.
We're
free
now.
Free.
ERICA:
I
never
saw
the
brothers
again
In
time,
this
war,
like
every
other
war,
ended
But
I
never
forgot
And
I
come
to
this
place
often
Though
no
one
else
does
In
the
early
days
of
World
War
III,
guerillas,
mostly
children,
placed
the
names
They
fought
here
alone
and
gave
up
their
lives
so
that
this
nation

end
