lord.

Reverend,
with
your
permission,
Young
man,
this
is
a
house
of
God.
I
understand
that,
reverend.
The
South
Carolina
Militia
I'm
here
to
enlist
every
man
willing.
REVEREND:
Son,
we
are
here
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
those
men
Yes,
pray
for
them.
But
honour
them
And
bring
more
suffering
If
King
George
can
hang
those
men,
our
Dan
Scott,
barely
a
week
ago,
I
heard
you
rail

Mr.
Hardwick,
how
many
times
speak
of
freedom
Half
the
men
in
this
church,
and
you,
reverend,
are
as
ardent
patriots
as
I.
Will
you
now,
when
you
are
Is
that
the
sort
of
men
you
are?

I
ask
only
that
you
act
of
which
you
have
and
in
which
you
Who's
with
us?

Mr.
Howard.
Sir,
may
I
have
permission
Eh?
May
I
have
permission
to
write
Anne?
You
have
permission
to
write
me.
Oh,
write
her.
Very
well.
Thank
you,
sir.
Reverend?
A
shepherd
must
tend
his
flock.
And,
at
times,
fight
off
the
wolves.


Are
you
sure
this
is
the
right
place
God
save
King
George!

I
think
we
came
to
the
right
place.
Any
bounty?

He
ain't
overly
smart.
Can
you
write?
No,
no,
sir.
Well,
then,
make
your
mark.
I
just
signed
him
over

you.
If
you're
willing,
That'll
do.
I'll

I

you
would.
How

are
you?

Not
quite
old
enough.

Twelve.
Good.

GABRIEL:
Dear
Anne:
Our

grow.
As
long
as
we
continue
to

I
long

Come,

Come.
My
good

My
brave

I
thank
you
for
that.
I'm
afraid
I
don't
know
your
name.
I'm
a
colonel
in
the
Continental
Army.
As
you
wish.
Please
be

Thank
you.
Would
you,

I

Yes,
I

Proceed.

your

personal
effects

I'd

Indeed.
I
will
do
so
Thank
you.
Now
we
come
to
the
matter
of

the
chaos

must
be
gentlemen

and,
where
necessary,
Restrain
them
from,
say,
targeting
civilians.
That's
a
separate
issue.
No,
no,
no.
I
consider
them
linked.
And
as
long
as
your

I
will
order
the
shooting
of
officers
And
my
men
Very
well.
Now,
let
us
move

have
18

you

Sir.
Top

They
refused
to
give

their

You
know,
this

not
the

a
compliment.
Get

Arrange
the

Thank
you,

Release
the

18

Who
is
he?
I
recognize
him.
He's

Commander

Your
ghost.
He

Very
well,
then.

Well?
Well
what?
Oh.

I'll
see
you
in
Pembroke
soon.
Not
soon
enough.
Nathan,
know.
What?
Say
my
prayers,
Couldn't
have
said
it
better.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye,
Susan.
Goodbye?
Just
one
word,
that's
all
I
want.
No?
All
right.
Papa!
Papa,
don't
go!
I'll
say
anything.
Please,
Papa.
I'll
say
anything
you
want.
Tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
say.
I
promise,
Papa.
Please
don't
go.
I
promise.
I'll
come
back.
I'll
come
back.
You
believe
me?
You
know,
you
make
me
very
happy.
Just
the
three
of
us?
John
Raskin
did
come
by
earlier.
He
looked
around,
then
he
left.
He
would've
made
four.
Four
would
have
been
better.

I
got
another
two
months

Mr.

Colonel
Tavington
wishes
to
address
This

aid
I
wish
to
know
his
whereabouts.
So,
anyone
who
comes
forward
may
be
forgiven
their
treason.
Very
well.
You
had
your
chance.
MAN:
Wait!
This
man
gives
them
supplies.
He
brings
them
to
Black
Swamp.
In
the
marsh,
This
man
here?
Yes.
The
Black
Swamp,
you
say?
By
the
old
Spanish
mission.
Thank
you
very
much.
Shut
the
doors.
But
you
said
we'd
be
forgiven.
And
indeed
you
may!
That's
between
you
and
God.
Be
strong.
We
must.
I'll
fire
the
town
on
your
orders.
The
town?
Burn
the
church.
There's
no
honour
in
this.
Didn't
you
say
all
those
who
stand
deserve
to
die
a
traitor's
death?
Burn
the
church,
Captain.

Give
me
the
torch.

The
honour
is
found
in
the
end,
This
will
be
forgotten.

Yah.

Just
don't

Don't
talk.

I'm
sorry.
Be
quiet.
I'll
take

of
you.
I'm
sorry
about

Oh,
son,
that
wasn't
your
fault.
That
was
mine.
Hold
on.
You're
gonna
be
all
right.
Don't
go.
Gabriel,
don't.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh,

help
me.
God
help
me.
Where
is
he?
BURWELL:
I'll

him.

But
if
you
come
with

Why?
Why
do

feel
Is
it
arrogance
or...?
I
have
long
feared...
that
my
sins
would
return
And
the
cost

Your
victories
and
your

are

than

Stay

I
have

You

will
be
leaving
with

Yes.
Prepare

You
will
be
missed
tomorrow,
Missed,
my
lord?
Your
wound.
It's
nothing,
my
lord.
I
am,
as
ever,
ready
to
serve.
Very
well.
Make
sure
you
do.
I

My

no

I
grant
you
that
small
measure

failure
Thus

not

Gentlemen,
Not

does

outnumber

nearly
half

Unreliable,
at
best.
Excuse
me,
sir.
I

you

All

you
do.
We've

are
you

Ben?
I'm

we

all
I'm

Dear
Charlotte:
The
war
has
turned.
General
Cornwallis
took
flight
We
continued
to
engage
the
British,
Cornwa/lis
entrenched
himself
Washington
escaped
from
the
north
and
surrounded
Cornwallis,
It
was
blocked
off
by
who
had
finally
arrived.
Vive
la
France.
Vive
la
liberté.

My
lord,
I
beseech
you.
You
must
order
the
surrender.
CORNWALLIS:
How
could
it
come
to
this?
Peasants.
Everything
will
change.
Everything
has
changed.
BENJAMIN:
Cornwa/lis
himself
hid
in
shame,
appointing
his
subordinate
With
the
war
ending,
I
take
measure
of
what
and
what
we
have
won.
My
hope
and
prayer
is
that
will
spawn
and
fu/fi/
the
promise
Tell
the
children,
and
especially
as
I
will
be
returning
Where
will
you
go
now?
Home.
Start
over.
Your
wife's
expecting
a
child,
She
gave
birth
to
a
son
What'd
you
name
him?
We
named
him
Gabriel.
Thank
you,
Harry.
Gabriel
is
a
good
name
for
a
farmer.
It
is.
It
is.
Jean.
Ben.


Gabriel
said
if
we
won
the
war
we
could
build
a
whole
new
world.
Just
figured
we'd
get
started
with
your
home.
Sounds
good.
Thank
you.
Ma'am.
