Mess

Anything

I
don't
think
so.
What's
this?
It's
a
pull-through.
You're
learning.
Okay,
all
of
you!
You're
gonna
keep
this
lot
so
clean
Let's
get
two
things
straight
The
first
thing:
You
will
not
move
at
all...
until
that
word
of
command
You
will
not
fidget,

Is
that
understood?

Right!
Any
questions?
-
Yes.
I
mean,
was
there
any
special
reason?
-
What
do
you
think?
To
impress
the
French!
Right.
Let's
have
a
look
at
what
Right!
Now,

start

Count!
Still!
Perfectly

ranks!

Turn!
Get
a
hold
of
it
now!
Come
along!

At
arm
level,
by
your
right
!

Get
your
arm
up:
Eyes...
front!



-
Beddows,
isn't
it?

What
haven't
you
done,
Beddows?
I
seem
to
have
neglected
to
blanco

-See
to
it
next
time:

By
the
right!
Quick
march!


Left,
right
!
Left,
right
!
Now

Squad

What
are
you
bloody
doing,
Beddows?
-




Spill
his
guts

-
For
fuck's
sake,
get
between--

Don't
look
down:
Don't
look
down!

Come
on!
Come

Keep
those
rifles
dry:

-

-

Come

Come

You
haven't
finished
yet!


Fuck.
I
need
a
fag.
They're
ahead.

Well,
you
go
on.
-
I
hate
this
war.
No,
it's
not
that.
We
was
engaged,
see,
and
--
and
then
when
orders
come
along,
her
old
man

Sod
him:
Said
we
could
wait
Bastard.
He'd
let
the
Jerries
poke
his
wife




I
wanted
to
fly.
Failed
the
medical.
Didn't
know
that.
-
Who
you
got
waiting
for
you,
Tommy?
Well,
there's
Mum
and
Dad,
I
suppose.
And
Tina.
Good
for
you,
mate.
Let
me
guess.
She
got
brown
hair,
brown
eyes...
pale
skin,
nice
tits,
right?
Tina
is
a
cocker
spaniel.
-
She's
a
lovely
dog.
Yeah.
A
bitch.
What
are
you
gonna
do
Oh,
I
don't
know.
I've
got
me
plans.
Garage,
mate.
I'm
gonna
buy
a
garage
somewhere
round
here

-
How
'bout
coming
in
with
me,
Tom?


Coming
with
me
and
the
lads
tomorrow?
We're
celebrating
--
end
of
training.
Pub
crawl
in
the
afternoon,
Yeah.
Yeah,
okay.
What's
the
film?
Forget
the
picture,
mate.
You
get
next
to
a
nice
piece
in
the
back
stalls,
Oh,
for
Christ's
sake.

-
They
got
at
least
10
minutes
on
us:


-I'm
going
down:
Yeah.
Hey!
Don't
do
it.

-
Has
he
seen
the
M:O:?

Prisoner
and
escort:::

about:::
turn!
Prisoner
and
escort,
quick
march!
Left,
right!
Left,
right!
Prisoner
and
escort,
halt!




Private
Beddows,
fall
in!

At
0900
hours,

where
you'll
get
the
transport

You'll
be
back
here
by
2100
hours:::

or
your
mother
won't
recognize
you

Forget
what
I've
told
you,
-
Comfy,
was
it?

Making
a
signal,
Beddows?
Only
for
"victory,"
Corporal.

Hello,Jack:
You're
a
solitary
sort
I
felt
like
reading.
Christ,
I
wish
You
spill
your
blood
and
guts
and
then
four
years
later,
you
get
ready
to
And
in
between,


It's
a
fucking
mix-up,
if
you
ask
me.

I've
been
in
His
Majesty's
bleeding
forces
seen
active
service,
and
now
they
want
to
-
You
know
what
that
means,
don't
you?
It
means
we'll
be
the
first
ashore
when
they
Mmm.
-
I
suppose
someone's
got
to
go
first.




where
you
will
be
joined

and
take
part
in
combined
exercises


-
Hi!
-
Oh-ho!
And
you,
soldier.
-
Good
luck.
Have
a
good
time.
Bye.
-
How
you
doing?
Let's
have
a
quickie.
-
Come
on,
sweetheart.







Move
up
the
beach

Keep
moving:
Keep
moving:

-
Keep
them
moving,
Sergeant
!


Hold
those
rifles
high








until
you
are
instructed
-
This
is
a
bloody
nightmare.
Watch
out.
We're
going
in.








Ah!
Aha.
Right
then,
Tom.
This
is
it.
Lots
of
lovely
crumpet
-
Are
you
ready?
Freeman's
again.
Here.
Take
'em.
-
Right.
Fit?
Okay.
-
Good
evening.
Early
tonight,
lads?
-
Got
any
wine,
have
you?
-
Two
pints
of
brown
ale
then,
please.
Look
around,
my
boy.
-
Half
the
regiment.
Ta.


Oh,
we're
not
gonna
be
around

??

-
Hello.
-
You
haven't
got
a
drink.
-
Can
I
--
Can
I
get
you
one?
-
Have
you
been
here
long?
No.
Here,
generally.
About
as
long
as
most
people,
Oh.
-
And
you?
-
How
long
have
you
been
here?
Just
arrived
really.
But,
um,
I
don't
think
I'll
stay
long.

-It's
a
bit
dull,
don't
you
think?
-
Dances,
all
this.
-
Oh?
Well,
then
let's
--
Uh,
will
you
have
a
dance
-
I
don't
mind
if
I
do.
-
How
you
doing,
Arthur?
-
Watch
out.
-
I'm
not
very
good
on
my
feet.
No.
Let's
go
on,
please.
??



-
??

You're
not
as
bad
as
all
that.
Shall
we
go
outside
for
a
bit?
What
for?
The
rain's
stopped.
All
right.
-
Is
this
your
coat?
Have
you
seen
any
action?
Not
really.
What
do
you
mean,
"Not
really"?
Well,
I've
been
on
training.
-
Really?
-
Do
you
like
it?
Being
a
soldier.
Not
much,
no.
Then
why
are
you?
-
A
soldier?
I
was
called
up,
like
everyone
else.
-
Is
that
all?
It's
gotta
be
done.
We
gotta
finish
it
off
Yes.
I
think
you're
very
nice.
Do
you?
Yes,
I
do.
I
like
you
too.
I
feel
much
better
now.
I
was
quite...
nervous
when
I
-
It's
funny.
You
thought
the
dance
I
didn't,
really.
-
No?
C-Can
I
kiss
you?
If
you
want.
I've
got
to
go
now.
Oh.
Whenever
you'd
like.
-
Monday?
Here,
at
6:00.
All
right.
Will
you
walk
me
back
to
the
hall?
Anywhere
you'd
like.
Back
to
the
hall.
I
wish
I'd
met
you
before.
What
do
you
say
that
for?
I
don't
know.
It's
just
a
feeling.
You'll
be
back...
and
there'll
be
time.
Where
are
we
going?
I've
lost
all
sense
of
direction.
A
game
of
musical
bloody
chairs,
mate.
Thousands
of
us
waiting
for
someone
to
shout,
First
one
over's
a
Charlie,
You'd
think
they'd
have
a
bit
of
sympathy
for
us
A
G.I.
told
me
It's
in
the
dictionary

?
Until
we're
there
?

?
There's
lots
and
lots
of
rumors

?
We
heard
the
captain
say

?
We're
on
the
move
today

?
We
only
hope
the
blinking
sergeant-major

They've
chased
us

And
now
we're

No
one's

We're
singing

Oh,
we
don't

where
we're
going

?
We
went
from
here
to
Lancashire
?

?
And
then
to
Salisbury
Plain
?

?
And
then
we
got
to
Somerset
?

?
And
now
we're
back
again
?

?
We'd
like
to
settle
down
?

?
We
seem
to
hope
in
vain

For
someone's
passed
the
word
along

We're
on

move
again

-

Wake
up
!
Look
lively
!

Come
on!
Move!

Fall
in
opposite
the
barbed
wire
!

You
won't
be
doing
any
work:

Sorry
about
the
tight
security:

It
means
no
wireless
sets,

and
I'm
afraid
none
of
your
letters

I'm
sure
all
of
you
realize

That's
all
for
now:


I
thought
you
were
meeting
me
tonight.
-
I
was
called
away.
To
fight
the
war.
-
Couldn't
you
have
told
me?
So
you
left
me.

-
There
was
no
choice:
Don't
know.

Am
I
going
to
wait
for
you?
I
don't
know.
I
do
though.
Good-bye,
Tom.
Please...
don't
go.



Fill
in
the
form,
please:
If
I
get
killed,
It's
for
our
records,
Oh.
Follow
the
sign
outside,
please,
if
you
haven't
already.
God.
How
much
more?
There's
a
will
form
--
-
What
for?

??


??


-

Cannon
fodder.

Die
of
boredom,
die
in
battle:
Did
you
hear
what
Tom
did
No.
He
went
to
see
old
Nickelby...
and
asked
him
if
they
gave
out
compassionate
leave
So
Nickelby
said,
"Oh,
yeah,
yeah,
And
Tom
said,
"Well,
there
hasn't
"but
there's
gonna
be
one
very
soon.
I
request
leave
to
go
home

What
did
Nickelby
do?
He
sent
Tom
with
a
note
to
the
M.O.
Oh,
Tommy.
He's
nuts.

No,
no:
No,
Tommy's
not
nuts:
He
could
do
with
a
break.
Well,
we
could
all
do
It's
been
nothing
but
film
shows,
and
lemonade
in
the
bleedin'
NAAFI
-
Ah.
They're
for
me.
Shit.
Don't
tell
me
it's
your
birthday.
Yeah.
Couple
of
days
ago.
The
mail
was
held
up.
-
What's
that?
-
It's
a
key.
-
What's
it
for?
You
know,
key
to
the
door,

-
You
just
2
1?
Happy
birthday,
kid.
-
Plenty
more
of'em.
How
about
this,Jack?
Oh,
that's
nice.
I
think
I'll
go
and
get
some
ink
-
Can
I
have
a
look
at
your
cards?



Dearest
Mum
and
Dad--

Thank
you
very
much
for
your
letter



My
fountain
pen
works
very
well,

We're
very
cut-off
here,

I
don't
know
where
we
are,
exactly:

It
was
so
nice
to
hear
from
you:

You
don't
have
to
worry
about
me:

We
are
eating
very
well
in
this
camp:

Although
the
beds
are
hard,

We
all
think
the
invasion

It's
like
being
part
of
a
machine

while
we
grow
smaller
and
smaller





Yesterday
I
saw
a
fox

And
when
we
could
still
go
out
I
went
to
see

I
thought
it
was
terrific
at
the
time:::

but
I
can't
remember
much
about
it
now:

Seems
so
distant:

Everything
outside
the
army



I
must
have
done
even
more
traveling

than
when
I
went
to
France

But
I
couldn't
tell
you
where
we
are

All
we
seem
to
do
is
sit
in
trucks
and
barracks,





your
news
about
Tina
would
have
left
me

But
now
it
just
seems

like
everything
else:

I
was
going
to
ask
you

but
I
don't
think

I
don't
think
I
shall
live

It
sounds
silly:::

but
this
war
has
killed

I'm
just
going
to
be
another
one:

Of
that
I'm
sure:

I
can
feel
it:::

the
way
you
feel
it

I
didn't
know
whether
to
tell
you:

I
thought
you
shouldn't
get

without
knowing
what
was
inside:

Please
be
brave:

I
shall
be
all
right:

I'm
not
frightened:






























It
is
necessary
to
burn

or
wrap
them
in
the
paper
being
issued

The
choice
is
yours:

You
will
carry
nothing
I've
got
nothing
now.
I've
thrown
it
all
away.


I
don't
think
You'll
be
all
right.
We'll
get
you
through.





-

-
I'm
not
walking
through
this
lot.

-
??


-
??



?
That
I
hope
he
will
enjoy
?

?
A
far
nicer
boy
??

-
Sing
it
again,
Susannah:
Sing
it
right
through
once
more,

-
??


?
Let
him
sink
or
let
him
swim
?

?
And
I
don't
care
for
him
?
?
He
can
go
and
get
another
?


-
?
For
I'm
??
Tommies,
please
don't
go.


I
think
I'm
gonna
be
sick
again.
-
Why
didn't
you
become
an
officer,Jack?
They
locked
me
and
told
me
to
imagine
If
I
used
that
wall,
I'd
be
shot.
If
I
trod
here,
there,
anywhere,
I
didn't
move
a
fucking
inch.
If
they
hadn't
come
and
let
me
out,
waitin'
to
become
an
officer.

-

We're
