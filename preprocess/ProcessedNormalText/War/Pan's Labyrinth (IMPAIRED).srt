Spain,
1944
The
Civil
War
is
over.
Hidden
in
the
mountains...
armed
men
are
still
fighting
Military
posts
are
established


NARRATOR:
A
long
time
ago,
where
there
are
no
lies
or
pain...
there
lived
a
princess
She
dreamt
of
blue
skies,
One
day,
eluding
her
keepers,
Once
outside,
and
erased
her
memory.
She
forgot
who
she
was
Her
body
suffered
cold,
And
eventually
she
died.
However,
her
father,
the
king,
always
knew
that
the
princess'
soul
perhaps
in
another
body...
in
another
place,
at
another
time.
And
he
would
wait
for
her,
until
the
world
stopped
turning.
I
don't
understand
why
you
had
We're
going
to
the
country,
Fairy
tales-
You're
a
bit
too
old
to
be
filling
your
head
Ask
him
to
stop
the
car,
please.
Ofelia,
wait.
Your
brother
is
acting
up.
Madam,
are
you
okay?
CHAUFFEUR:
Water.



MOTHER:
Ofelia?
Ofelia,
come
here.
I
saw
a
fairy.
Just
look
at
your
shoes!
Let's
go.
When
we
get
to
the
mill,
I
want
you
to
call
him
father.
You
have
no
idea
It's
just
a
word,
Ofelia...
Just
a
word...

MAN:
Captain,
here
they
come.
15
minutes
late.

Carmen.
Welcome.
That's
not
necessary.
Dr.
Ferreiro
prefers
No.
Come.
Do
it
for
me.
Thank
you.
Ofelia,
come
out.
Say
hello
to
the
captain.
Ofelia.
It's
the
other
hand,
Ofelia.
Mercedes!
Bring
their
luggage.
Yes,
sir.

MERCEDES:
It's
a
labyrinth.
Just
a
pile
of
old
rocks
Even
before
the
mill.
Better
not
to
go
in
there.
Thank
you.
Have
you
read
them
all?
CHAUFFEUR:
Mercedes!
The
captain
is
calling.
Your
father
needs
me.
He's
not
my
father.
The
captain
is
not
my
father.
My
father
was
a
tailor.
He
died
in
the
war.
The
captain
is
not
my
father.
You've
made
that
clear
enough.
Have
you
seen
my
mother?
-
Isn't
she
beautiful!
She's
sick
with
baby.
Did
you
notice?

The
guerrillas
are
sticking
to
the
woods...
because
it's
hard
Those
bastards
know
the
terrain
We'll
block
all
access
to
the
woods.
Food,
medicine-
We
need
to
force
them
down,
We'll
set
up
three
new
command
posts.
Mercedes.
-
Ask
Dr.
Ferreiro
to
come
down.
This
will
help
you
sleep
through
the
night.
Just
two
drops
just
before
bed.
Two
drops
only.
Very
good.
All
of
it.
Good.
Don't
hesitate
to
call
me
You
or
your
nurse.
Good
night.
Close
the
door
and
turn
off
You
have
to
help
us.
The
wound
is
getting
worse.
This
is
all
I
could
get.
I'm
sorry.
Captain
Vidal
is
waiting
CARMEN:
Come
here,
Ofelia.
Jesus,
your
feet.
They're
frozen.

Are
you
afraid?
A
little.

What's
that
noise?
Nothing-
just
the
wind.
Nights
here
are
different
from
city
nights.
There,
you
hear
cars-
the
tramway.
Here
the
houses
are
old.
They
creak.

As
if
they
were
speaking.
Tomorrow
I'm
going
to
give
you
a
surprise.
-
A
surprise?
-
A
book?
Why
did
you
have
to
get
married?
I
was
alone
too
long.
I'm
with
you.
You
weren't
alone.
You
were
never
alone.
When
you're
older,
you'll
understand.
Your
brother's
at
it
again.
Tell
him
one
of
your
stories.
I'm
sure
he'll
calm
down.
My
brother,
my
brother...
many,
many
years
ago...
in
a
sad,
faraway
land...
there
was
an
enormous
mountain
At
sunset...
on
top
of
that
mountain...
a
magic
rose
blossomed
every
night...
that
made
whoever
plucked
it
immortal.
But
no
one
dared
go
near
it...
because
its
thorns

Men
talked
amongst
themselves
and
pain,
but
never
about
And
every
day,
the
rose
wilted,
forgotten
and
lost
at
the
top
forever
alone,
until
the
end
of
time.
-

-
How
is
she?
She'll
have
as
much
rest
I'll
sleep
down
here.
-
And
my
son?
Excuse
us,
Captain...
My
son,
how
is
he?
For
the
moment,
there's
no
Very
good.
Captain,
your
wife
should
not
have
traveled
Is
that
your
opinion?
My
professional
opinion,
yes,
sir.
A
son
should
be
born
That's
all.
One
more
thing,
Captain.
What
makes
you
so
sure
Don't
fuck
with
me.
At
8
o'clock,
we
detected
movement
Sergeant
Bayona
searched
the
area
The
other
one's
his
son,
Captain,
my
father
is
an
honest
man.
Let
me
judge
that.
Take
your
hat
off
in
front
of
me.
We
found
this
weapon
on
him.
My
father
was
hunting
rabbits,
Captain.
Again
-
keep
quiet.
"No
god,
no
country,
no
master"?
Just
like
that
-
how
do
you
like
that?
Red
propaganda,
Captain.
-
It's
not
propaganda,
sir.
It's
an
old
almanac,
Captain.
We're
just
farmers.
Go
on.
I
went
up
into
the
woods,
Captain,
For
my
daughters.
They're
sick.
Rabbits,
uh?
Captain,
if
my
father
says
so,
Leave
him
alone.
You
killed
him,
you
killed
him!
Murderer!
Son
of
a
bitch!
Maybe
you'll
learn
to
search
before
you
come
bothering
me.
Yes,
Captain.


Mother.
Mother,
wake
up!
Mother,
there's
something
in
the
room.

Hello.
Did
you
follow
me
here?
Are
you
a
fairy?

Look!
This
is
a
fairy.

You
want
me
to
go
with
you?
Outside?
Where?

Hello?
Echo.

Hello?
-

It's
you.
It's
you.
You've
returned.
Don't
be
frightened,
I
beg
you.
Look
-
look...

My
name
is
Ofelia.
Who
are
you?
Me?
I've
had
so
many
names...
Old
names
that
only
the
wind
I
am
the
mountain,
I
am...

I
am
a
faun.
Your
most
humble
servant,
your
highness.
-
No,
I'm-
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
underworld.
My
father
was
a
tailor.
You
are
not
born
of
man.
It
was
the
moon
that
bore
you.
Look
on
your
left
shoulder
Your
real
father
had
us
open
to
allow
your
return.
This
is
the
last
of
them.
But
we
have
to
make
sure...
that
your
essence
is
intact...
that
you
have
not
become
a
mortal.
You
must
complete
three
tasks
This
is
the
Book
Of
Crossroads.
Open
it,
when
you
are
alone
show
you
what
must
be
done.
But
there's
nothing
in
here.


Mercedes,
prepare
these
rabbits
They
are
too
young.
Well,
maybe
they'll
do
for
a
stew.
Yes,
sir.
This
coffee
was
burnt.
Taste
it
yourself.
You
should
keep
an
eye
on
it.
As
you
wish,
sir.
Cook
these.
He
didn't
like
the
coffee.
He's
nothing
but
a
fussy
dandy.
We're
going
to
need
some
beef
Where
are
we
supposed
to
find
that?
The
doctor's
wife,
the
mayor's
too.
Well,
they
eat
more
than
a
couple
of
pigs.
-
And
they
won't
shut
up.
I'll
be
back
in
a
moment,
Mercedes.
Ofelia.
Your
father
is
giving
Look
what
I've
made
for
you.
Do
you
like
it?
What
I
wouldn't
have
given
as
fine
as
this
when
I
was
your
age!
Do
you
like
them?
Yes,
they're
very
-
pretty.
Go
on,
now.
Take
your
bath.

CARMEN:
Ofelia?
Ofelia?
Ofelia?
Hurry
up.
I
want
you
to
be
beautiful
You'll
look
like
a
princess.
A
princess.
Make
sure
those
chickens
And
don't
forget
the
beans.
COOK:
You
look
marvelous,
What
a
gorgeous
dress!
Get
back
to
work,
stop
wasting
time.
Do
you
want
some
milk
with
honey?
Move
back,
we
can't
have
you
with
you
looking
so
pretty.
Mercedes.
Do
you
believe
in
fairies?
No.
But
when
I
was
a
little
girl,
I
did.
I
believed
in
a
lot
of
things

Last
night,
a
fairy
visited
me.
Really?
And
it
wasn't
alone,
there
were
A
faun?
He
was
very
old,
very
tall
My
mother
warned
me
CAPTAIN:
Mercedes!
Come
with
me.
Captain,
everything
is
here.
Flour,
salt,
oil,
medicine...
olives,
bacon...
-
This
-
this
is
real
tobacco.
I
need
you
to
check
the
inventory.
CAPTAIN:
Very
well.
Mercedes.
-
The
key.
Is
this
the
only
copy?
The
only
one.
From
now
on,
I'll
carry
it.
SOLDIER:
Captain.
Captain,
perhaps
it's
nothing.
It's
them.

"Once
upon
a
time,
they
were
home
to
creatures
"They
protected
one
another...
and
slept
in
the
shade
that
grew
on
a
hill,
near
the
mill.
"
"But
now,
the
tree
is
dying.
"
"Its
branches
are
dry,
"A
monstrous
toad
and
won't
let
the
tree
thrive.

"You
must
put
the
three
magic
stones
and
retrieve
the
golden
key
"Only
then

were
here
They
left
in
a
hurry.
A
dozen
men,
at
most.
Antibiotics.
Shit,
they
forgot
this
lottery
ticket.
They're
here.
Those
sons
of
bitches
are
here...
and
they're
watching
us.
Hey!

You
left
this
behind!
And
your
lottery
ticket!
Why
don't
you
come
back
and
get
it?
Who
knows?

H-
Hello.
I'm
Princess
Moanna...
and
I'm
not
afraid
of
you.
Aren't
you
ashamed
eating
all
these
bugs...
and
growing
fat
while
the
tree
dies?


Hey!





CARMEN:
Have
you
looked
MERCEDES:
Yes,
ma'am.
-
Have
you
checked
the
garden?
-
And
the
barn?
Where
is
that
girl?
This
way,
please.
Let
me
introduce
you
-
Charmed.
From
now
on,
Take
a
look
at
them.
-
One?
Captain,
I'm
not
sure
If
people
are
careful,
CAPTAIN:
We
can't
allow
anyone
to
send
food
to

They're
losing
ground,
Excuse
me,
Captain,
We
almost
got
them
today.
We
found
this.
Antibiotics.
God
has
already
saved
their
souls.
What
happens
to
their
bodies
We'll
help
you
We
know
you're
not
here
You're
wrong
about
that.
I
choose
to
be
here
because
I
want
my
son
Because
these
people
That
we're
all
equal.
But
there's
a
big
difference:
And
if
we
need
to
kill
every
one
then
we'll
kill
them
all,
and
that's
that.
We're
all
here
by
choice.
ALL:
By
choice!
Put
the
coffee
on.
We'll
take
care
of
it.

Ofelia?

So
-
how
did
you
Ofelia's
father
used
to
make
Oh,
I
see...
And
after
he
died,
A
little
more
than
a
year
ago,
Curious,
isn't
it!
I
mean,
finding
each
other
again?
Oh,
yes,
very,
very
curious.
Please,
forgive
my
wife.
She
hasn't
been
exposed
to
the
world.
She
thinks
these
silly
stories
MAYOR'S
WIFE:
We
understand.
Ofelia
is
here.
Excuse
me.
Have
I
told
you
that
I
was
acquainted
No.
I
had
no
idea.
In
Morocco.
I
knew
him
only
briefly,
An
excellent
soldier.
The
men
in
his
battalion
said...
that
when
General
Vidal
He
smashed
his
watch
on
a
rock...
so
that
his
son
would
know
the
exact
hour
So
he
would
know
how
a
brave
man
dies.
Nonsense.
He
didn't
own
a
watch.
What
you've
done
hurts
me.
When
you've
finished
your
bath,
Are
you
listening?
Sometimes
I
think
You've
disappointed
me,
Ofelia.
And
your
father,
too.
You
mean
the
captain?
Him
more
than
me.
I've
got
the
key.
Take
me
to
the
labyrinth.

Hello.
I
got
the
key
out.
That's
me,
and
the
girl
is
you.
And
the
baby?
So-
you
retrieved
the
key.
I'm
glad.

She
believed
in
you
She's
so
glad
you
succeeded.
Keep
the
key.
You'll
be
needing
it
very
soon.
And
this
too.
A
piece
of
chalk.
Two
tasks
remain...
and
the
moon
is
almost
full.
Be
patient.
We'll
soon

She'll
have
to

The

I'll

you

No,
I
haven't.
I

Nor
I

you

Only
one...

words.
I
don't
care.

-

Don't
be
afraid.
It's
only
me.
-
Are
you
ready?
Then
let's
go.
This
is
sheer
madness.
When
that
man
finds
out
Have
you
thought
about
that?

you

afraid

It's
not

not
for
myself.

my
brother.


You
didn't
carry
out
the
task.
No,
my

is
sick.
That's
no
excuse
for
negligence.

is

you
through.
You're
going
to
a
very
dangerous
place,
The
thing
that
slumbers
there...
it
is

You
will
see

No!
No!

Then
we'll

And
then
what?
You

You've
made
Mama
very
sick.
I
want
to
ask
you
one
favor
don't
hurt
her.
You'll
meet
her,
she's
very
pretty...
even
though
sometimes
she's
sad
You'll
see,
when
she
smiles,
you'll
love
her.
Listen,
if
you
do
what
I
say...
I'll
make
you
a
promise.
I'll
take
you
to
my
kingdom,
I
promise
you,
a
prince.
MAN:
I
sounded
the
whistle,
I
tried
to
stop,
but
it
was
too
late.
The
fireman
and
I
but
look
at
the
mess
they
made.
What
did
they
steal
They
didn't
open
a
single
one.
What
the
hell
are
you
talking
about?
This
whole
mess,
they
didn't
They
didn't
take
anything.
Nothing?
Are
you
sure?
God
only
knows
what
they
wanted,

They
came
out
of
nowhere,
Captain.
They
have
grenades,
they
went
up
the
hill.
Captain,
we've
surrounded
a
small
unit.
They
took
cover
up
on
the
hill.

Go
ahead,
Serrano,
don't
be
afraid.
This
is
the
only
decent
way
to
die.


Serrano!

Let
me
see.
Can
you
talk?
Damn
it.
CAPTAIN:
These
are
useless-

Captain,
this
one's
still
alive.
Shot
in
the
leg.
-
-What's
happened?
-
What?
And
they're
taking
him
to
the
storeroom.
Mercedes!
Pedro...
Pedro...
Captain,
I
need
to
get
into
the
storeroom.
Not
now,
Mercedes.
Move
away.
That's
plenty,
dear.
Should
I
take
this
up?
Here,
half
the
dose.
I
don't
think
I
need
it.
I
feel
better,
much
better.
I
don't
understand
it.
Mother...

Damn,
this
cigarette
is
good!
Real
tobacco-
hard
to
find.
G-
G-Go
to
hell.
Damn,
Garces.
We
catch
one
and
he
turns
out
We'll
be
here
all
night.
As
long
as
he
talks...
Garces
is
right.
You'd
do
better
to
tell
us
everything.
But
to
make
sure
it
happens,
Just
things
you
pick
up
along
the
way.
At
first
I
won't
be
able
to
trust
you,
but
after
When
we
get
to
these...
we'll
have
developed
a...
A
closer
bond,
much
like
brothers.
You'll
see.
And
when
we
get
to
this
one...
I'll
believe
anything
you
tell
me.
I'll
make
you
a
deal.
If
you
can
count
to
three
you
can
go.
Don't
look
at
him,
look
at
me.
Above
me,
there's
no
one...
-
Garces!
If
I
say
this
asshole
can
leave,
-
No
one,
Captain.
There
you
have
it.
Count
to
three.
One...
Good.
Two...
Good
-
one
more
and
you're
free.
Shame.

FAUN:
Your
mother
is
much
better,
Surely,
you
must
be
relieved.
Yes,
thank
you.
But
things
haven't
turned
out
so
well.
No?
-
I
had
an
accident.
Yes.
Hm.

You
broke
the
rules!
It
was
only
two
grapes.
We've
made
a
mistake!
A
mistake?
You
failed.
You
can
never
return.
-
But
it
was
an
accident!
The
moon
will
be
full
in
three
days.
Your
spirit
shall
forever
remain
You
shall
age
like
them,
and
all
memory
of
you
shall
fade
in
time.
And
we'll
vanish
along
with
it.
You
will
never
see
us
again.
Good
day,
Doctor.
Sorry
to
wake
you

My
God,
what
have
you
done
to
him?
CAPTAIN:
Not
much.
But
things
are
getting
better.
I
like
having
you
handy,
Doctor.
Serrano,
stay
here.
I
talked.
Not
much...
b-
b-but
I
talked.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
so
sorry.
Kill
me,
kill
me
now.
Please.
Son
of
a
bitch.
It'll
take
away
the
pain.
It's
almost
over.

Watch
Dr.
Ferreiro,
I'll
be
right
there.
Yes,
Captain.
You're
not
moving
anymore.
What
are
you
doing
down
there?
-
Call
him!
Who
else,
you
imbecile?
Ferreiro!

What
the
hell
is
this?
No!
No,
no,
no,
no!
Leave
her.
Leave
her
alone,
please!
Look
at
this!
Look
what
she
What
do
you
think
of
this?
Ofelia,
what
is
this
thing
doing
It's
a
magic
root
the
faun
gave
me.
This
is
all
because
of
that
junk
Look
what
you've
done!
Please,
leave
us
alone.
Fine.
As
you
wish.
He
told
me
you
would
get
better.
Ofelia,
you
have
to
listen
to
your
father.
You
have
to
stop
all
this.
No.
I
want
to
leave
this
place!
Please,
take
me
away
from
here!
Things
are
not
that
simple.
You're
getting
older.
Soon
you'll
see
that
life
The
world
is
a
cruel
place.
And
you'll
learn
that,
even
if
it
hurts.
-
No!
No!
Magic
does
not
exist.

Mom!
Help!
Help!
-

Why
did
you
do
it?
It
was
the
only
thing
I
could
do.
No.
You
could
have
obeyed
me.
I
could
have,
but
I
didn't.
It
would
have
been
better
for
you.
I
don't
understand.
To
obey-
just
like
that-
for
the
sake
That's
something
only
people
Captain!
Garces!
Call
the
troop
paramedic.
-
Get
up
immediately!



Your
wife
is
dead.
PRIEST:
"Because
the
paths
because
the
essence
lies
in
His
word
and
in
his
mystery...
because
although
God
it
is
our
task
to
decipher
it...
because
when
we
open
our
arms...
the
earth
takes
in
only
a
hollow
Far
away
now
is
the
soul
because
it
is

in
His

Shh...
You
knew
Dr.
Ferreiro
pretty
well,
We
all
knew
him,
sir.
The
stutterer
spoke
of
an
informer.
Can
you
imagine?
Mercedes,
please.
What
must
you
think
of
me?
You
must
think
that
I'm
a
monster.
It
doesn't
matter
what
someone
I
want
you
to
go
to
the
storehouse
Yes,
sir.
Good
night,
sir.
Mercedes,
Sir?
The
key.
I
do
have
the
only
copy,
don't
I?
Yes,
sir.
You
know,
there's
an
odd
detail
Maybe
it's
not
important,
but...
the
day
they
broke
into
the
storehouse,
with
all
those
grenades
and
explosives...
the
lock
itself
wasn't
forced.
As
I
said,
it's
probably
not
important.
Be
very
careful.
Good
night,
sir.


Ofelia!
Ofelia!
Ofelia,
I'm
leaving
tonight.
Where
to?
I
can't
tell
you.
I
can't
tell
you...
-
Take
me
with
you.
I
can't,
my
child.
Take
me
with
you.

I
heard
something.
It's
nothing,
don't
worry.
Mercedes.
Ofelia.
How
long
have
How
long
have
you
been
laughing
at
me?
Little
bitch!
Watch
her!
And
if
anyone
tries
to
get
in...
kill
her
first.

Dry
meat.
Tobacco.
If
you
had
asked
for
it,
I
want
the
names
of
whoever
And
I
want
them
Yes,
Captain.
You
can
go,
Garces.
Are
you
sure,
Captain?
For
God's
sake,
she's
just
a
woman.
That's
what
you've
always
thought.
That's
why
I
was
able
to
get
away
with
it.
-
I
was
invisible
to
you.
You've
found
my
weakness:
pride.
But
it's
your
weak
points
It's
very
simple:
you
will
talk...
and
I
have
to
know...
that
everything
you
say
is
the
truth.
We
have
a
few
things
here
Nothing
complicated.
Things
we
learn
on
the
job.
At
first...
I'm
not
some
old
man!
Motherfucker...
You
won't
be
the
first
pig
I've
gutted!
RADIO:
The
winning
lottery
-
Hey...
Look:
he
let
her
go.
The
fuck
did
you
say?
Hey!
Get
her!
Come
on!
Bring
her
to
me!
Bring
her
to
me,
damn
it!
Mount
up!

Shh...
It'll
be
better
if
you
come
with
me
The
Captain
said
that
if
you
behave-
Don't
be
a
fool,
sweetheart.
If
anyone's
going
to
kill
you...
I'd
rather
it
be
me.







I've
decided
to
give
you
one
last
chance.
Do
you
promise
to
do
what
I
say?
Will
you
do
everything
I
tell
you,
This
is
your
last
chance.
Then
listen
to
me.
Fetch
your
brother...
and
bring
him
to
the
labyrinth...
as
quickly
as
you
can,
your
highness.
My
brother?
We
need
him.
-
But...
The
door's
locked.
In
that
case...
create
your
own
door.





Captain,
with
your
permission.
Come
quickly.
-
Now
what?
Wounded?
Where's
Garces?
How
many
were
there?
I
don't
know
exactly,
Captain.
Fifty
men,
at
least.
SOLDIER:
The
rest
of
the
men
Our
watch
posts
are
not
responding.
How
many
men
do
we
have
left?
Twenty,
maybe
less,
sir.
We're
leaving.
Together.
Don't
be
afraid.
Nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
you.

CAPTAIN:
Put
them
on
picket
duty
If
the
rest
of
the
squad
gets
Radio
for
reinforcements,
now.
Yes,
Captain.

Leave
him!





Ofelia!

Quickly,
your
majesty,
give
him
to
me.
The
full
moon
is
high
in
the
sky...
we
can
open
the
portal.
Why
is
that
in
your
hand?
The
portal
will
only
open
Just
a
drop
of
blood.
It's
the
final
task.
Hurry.

You
promised
to
obey
me!
No!
My
brother
stays
with
me.
You
would
give
up
your
sacred
rights
Yes,
I
would.
You
would
give
up
He
who
has
caused
you
Yes,
I
would.
Hmm...
As
you
wish...
your
highness.
No.

My
son.

Tell
my
son...
Tell
him
what
time
his
father
died.
-
Tell
him
that
I...
He
won't
even
know
your
name.



MAN:
Arise,
my
daughter.
Come.
Father.
You
have
spilled
your
own
blood
That
was
the
final
task,

And
you
chose
well,
your
highness.
Come
here
with
me,
He's
been
waiting
for
you
so
long.

it
is

That
she

there
with
justice
That
she

her
people.
And
that
she

to
those...
who

to
look.
