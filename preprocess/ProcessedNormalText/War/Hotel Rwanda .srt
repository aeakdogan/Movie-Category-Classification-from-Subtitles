No,
we
do
not

No,
we

What
is
it?
Tatiana,
go

You
mustn't

He
has
no

He's
a

Who
knows?
Someone

him

here?
-
Didn't
you
hear
the
news?
They
are
saying
President
Habyarimana
Tutsi
rebels
have
killed
him.
Nonsense.
Why
would
the
rebels
kill

-
Did
you
meet
with
Thomas
and
Fedens?
-
Go
and
call
them,
Tatsi.
-
Why
do
the
neighbors
run
to
us?
You
are
a
Tutsi.
They
are
scared,
Paul.
These
are
probably
rumors
We
must
remain
calm
Forgive
me,
Paul.
Gone?
Gone
where?
-
He
was
afraid
for
his
friend
Simon,
Mama.
He
went
next
door.
Wait.
Paul!
Tatiana,
no.
You
have
to
-
Stay
in
the

door
Where
is
he
hurt?
Look
here,
Odette,
look
here.
Stay
still,
Roger.
-
I
can't
find
the
wound.
-
Tell
your
mother.
Tell
your
mother
Roger,
you're
okay.
Do
not
worry,
he
is
not
cut.
This
is
not
his
blood,
Paul.
You
are
not
hurt.
My
darling,
it's
okay.
You
are
safe.
Come
here,
Elys.

Where
did
the
blood
come
from?

You
are
safe.
You
are
safe,

It's
okay.
I
love
you

Paul.
Listen
to
me,
good
people
of
Rwanda.
-
It
is
true.
Our
great
president
Oh,
my
God!
They
tricked
him
to
sign
Then
they
shot
his
plane
It
is
time
to
clear
the
brush,
We
must
cut
the
tall
trees.
Cut
the
tall
trees

Yes,
sir!
Who's
in
charge
here?
You.
-
Can
I
help
you,
sir?

Let
me
see
your
identity
card.
I
am
a

Mille
Collines.
I
used
to
work

the
Diplomat.
We
want
to
use
that
hotel.
You
must
open
it.

Paul!
I
must
take
them
with
me.
There
are
Tutsi
spies
everywhere.
I
cannot

or
you
die
first.
Sir,
what
could
I
pay
you
You
wanna
pay
me?
Why
not?
These
are
not
rebels.
Soon
they
will
be
worthless
to
you.
-
How
much?
10,000
francs
for
each.
-
Sir,
I
don't
have
that
much.
Wait,

give
you
something.
All
right?
Here
you
are.
Here,
Paul,
it's
all
I
have.
Here
you
are.
See?
This
is
enough
for
one
cockroach.
Sir...
I
will
give
you
100,000
francs

Give
me
it.
At
the
Mille
Collines

Hurry.
Go
with
my
soldiers.
And
hurry
back
The
soldiers
are

There
is
nothing
I
can
do.
Here's
the
money.
100,000
francs

promised.
Now
please,
let
them
go,
sir.
Take
the
money.

You
can
go.
Traitor.
Thank
you,
Paul.
Do
you
understand,
Dube?
-
You
must
tell
him
when
he
comes...
Paul,
I
have
to
go.
I
have
to
close
up
there.
It's
okay,
it's
okay.
There

I
need
a
line
now.
Please.
Hello?
You
did
not
reach
them?
No.
No
answer.
It
is
a
very
tense
situation,
of
those
who
are
there
that
we
are
to
try
to
ensure
Can
you
at
least
tell
us,
We
are
calling

moved
Mr.
Manager.
What
do
you
think
Who
is
it?
It's
okay,
darling.
What
do
you
want?
You
had
better
get
out
of
this
room
-
I
don't
have
to
listen
to
you
anymore.
I
am
in
charge.
Now
get
out
Mr.
Manager,
do
you
notice
If
I
were
to
leave
this
room,
And
I
know
people
But
maybe
it
doesn't
bother
you.
Are
you
used
to
the
smell?
Well,
not
me.
I
need
a
clean
room
Please
move
into
the
hotel.
My
house
has
been
burned.
Yes,
I
understand
this,
Your
Honor.
But
we
are
operating
I
can
give
you
one
room,
-
There's
no
way
we
can
share.
There
are
eight
of
us.
-
Yes?
Yes,
Madame
Archer.
They're
Tutsi
children
Okay,
come
on,
let's
go.

I
have
only
one
room.
Come.

Have
to
go
get
the
rest
of
them.
There
are
another
ten.
Madame
Archer.
I
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you.
My
brother-in-law
and
his
family,
On
O'Clare,
20.
Can
you
please
get
them
-
Sure.
Please,
keep
moving!
-
Thanks,
Paul.
Please
move
into
the
hotel!
Come
on,
kids,
don't
be
afraid.
-
Take
them
around
the
back.
Has
he
spoken
to
you
yet?
No.
Is
your
face
still
hurting?
It's
all
right.
The
neighbors
asked
me
I
shouldn't
have
brought
them
here.
The
first
thing
they
told
me
was
to
never,
never
lower
"Maintain
the
Mille
Collines'
dignity
Soon
all
of
this
will
be
over.
What
if
I
lose
my
job,
Tatsi?
Oh,
my
God!
-
Where
are
you
going?
Take
care
of
them.
How,
sir?
Bathe
them,
feed
them.
Put
them
to
bed.
I
will
send
you
some
help.
Okay,
babies.
We
have
heard
reports
Will
the
U.N.
Intervene
We're
here
as
peacekeepers,
My
orders
are

Excuse
me.

We're
not
allowed
David,

going
down
outside
We're
not
leaving
the
hotel
grounds
-
That's
the
ground
rules.
Where
do
you
think
we
are,
We
cover
the
story
from
here
Shoot
some
"B"
roll
of
the
refugees.
Let's
go.
Colonel,
I
have
no
way
And
I
have
more
refugees
I
was
given
20
orphans
today
This
is
not
a
refugee
camp.
Can
you
not
take
them
with
you
No,
I
can't
do
that,
Paul.
I'm
overwhelmed
I'm
under
attack,
constant
attack.
As
soon
