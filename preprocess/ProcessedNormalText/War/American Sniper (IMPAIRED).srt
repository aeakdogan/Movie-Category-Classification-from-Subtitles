MAN

I
got
a
military-age
male...
...that's
on
a
cell
phone,
OFFICER:
...you
have
a
green
light.
Your
call.
Maybe
he's
just
calling
his
old
lady.
Heh.
He
stepped
off.
Hold
on,
I
got
a
woman
and
a
kid
200
yards
Her
arms
aren't
swinging.
She's
got
a

got
a

You
got
eyes
on

Negative.
You
know
the

fry
you
if
you're
wrong.

-
You
got
him.
Now
get
back
here.
You
don't
ever
leave
Yes,
sir.
It
was
a
hell
of
a
shot,
son.
You
got
a
gift.
You're
gonna
make
a
fine
hunter
someday.
PASTOR:
...several
times,
...for
what
he
believes.
At
times,
we
all
have
to
do
that.
I
mean,
we
don't
see
with
his
eyes...
...so
we
don't
know
the
glory
of
his
plan.
Our
lives
unfold
before
us
like
-

What
are
you
doing?
PASTOR:
But
on
the

we
rise,

understand
the
mystery
of
his
ways.
Let
us
pray.
WAYNE:
Sheep,
wolves
and

Now,
some
people
prefer
to
believe
And
if
it
ever
darkened

they
Those
are
the
sheep.
And
then
you
got
predators.
They
use
violence
to
prey
on
the
weak.
They're
the
wolves.
Come
on,
Jeff,
punch
him.
And
then
there
are
those
who've
been
...and
the
overpowering
need
These
men
are
a
rare
breed...
...that
live
to
confront
the
wolf.
They
are

whup
your

it?
It
was
one
blow
from
a
single
man.
He
blew
100
men.
And
he's
single.
And
so...
Goddamn
it!
Shit!

not
the
way
the
call
home
Don't
be
weird
with
me.
Seriously.
I
want
you
to
tell
me
everything.
Well,
there's
certain
things
Okay,
you
knocked
me
up,
right?
And
I'm
sitting
here
by
myself,
...and
you
can't
talk
to
me?
That's
your
big
plan?
You
guys
almost
done
over
there,
yet?
I
can't
stop
thinking
about
that
little

Yeah,
it's
called
a
nightgown.

Yeah.
And
three
days?
Three
days
is
not
a
honeymoon.
You
know,
it
was
a
good
three
days.
I
miss
you
real
bad.
I
miss
you
too.
Hey,
you
want
me
to
talk
dirty
to
you?
Yeah.
Hold
on.
Hold
on
a
second.
But
I
got
a
phone
in
one
hand
...so
I
don't
know
what
I'm
gonna
do.
Well,
you're
gonna
have
to
decide
You're
horny
preggers.
Fat
and
horny.
-
It's
fucking
disgusting.
If
you
were
300
pounds,
I'd
still
do
you.
So
romantic.
How's
my
boy?
Nobody
said
it's
a
boy.
I
can't
wait
to
see
How
do
you
know?
I
just
know.
I
can
sense
it.
I
hope
you're
right.
Baby,
I
am
right.
Hey,
did
your
dad
get
ahold
of
you?
No,
I
haven't
checked
my
e-mails.
Shit.
Okay,
you
need
to
hang
up
Why,
what's
wrong?
Fuck,
I'm
so
selfish.
Taya,
what's
wrong?
What
happened?
Your
little
brother
deployed.
What?
What
happened
to
jump
school?
No,
he
didn't
get
in.
You
just
hang
up
and
call
your
dad,
okay?
What
do
you
mean?
Deployed?
Over
there.
He's
headed
to
Iraq.
I'm
sorry,
honey.

The
man
with
the
blade?
He's
a
Jordanian
militant.
He's
trained
by
bin
Laden.
His
name...
...is
Zarqawi.
Now
this
asshole...
...is
right
now
the
crown
prince
His
mercenary
army,
AQl?
Now,
these
guys
These
guys
are
well-trained,
...and
right
now,
they
are
waging
Zarqawi
and
his
lieutenants,
Now,
there
is
only
one
way
...and
that
is
to
go
door
to
door,
...until
we
find
them
or
we
find
someone
So
we
are
going
to
need
to
clear
...which,
I
know,
is
a
lot.
We're
gonna
be
loosening
things
up
This
is
the
highest
priority
target
I
want
this
asshole
dead
or
captured.
Do
you
understand?
Are
there
any
questions?
These
Marines
keep
rushing
in
...they'll
have
their
asses
shot
off.
They
don't
get
the
training
we
do.
Half
Let's
coach
them.
I'll
show
them
how

them.
All
these

They
know
your
name,

They're
not.
Just
keep
banging
on
the
long
gun.
CHRIS:
You
said
AQl
has
a
sniper
...but
Iraq
hasn't
qualified

because

He's
from

Well,

They

Yeah,
that
sounds
like
a
good
idea.

Can
I
tell
you

Your

He's
a

That's
right.
He
saved
my

...and
he
helped

two
weeks
ago.
Did
he
say
any
of
that
to
you?
Chris,
I
wanna
know
An
AQl
informant
had
called
in
a
tip...
...and
Biggles
had
just
been
shot.
We
were
operating
out
of
emotion,
But
that's
not
what
killed
him.
That
letter
did.
I
mean,
he
just
let
go,
Sign

Hey,
buddy.

Hey,
Chris?

Where
you
at?

Oh,

You're

They
say
they're
gonna
fix
my

though.
About
time.
It's

It's
too
soon?
Way
too
soon.
Hey,
I
heard
you

Yeah.
You
didn't
tell
her

You
told
her
you
bought

You
didn't?
No,
got
a
new
one.
It's
a
smaller
one.
Oh,
nice.
-
Oh,
good.
She
wouldn't
leave
me,
bro.
I
told
her
to
go,
and
she
wouldn't
leave.
She's
getting
a
raw
fucking
deal.
Why
would
you
say
that?
Don't
say
that.
All
two
inches
of
you.
Two
inches.
Yeah,
you
know,
I'm
glad
Ain't
no
way
you
could've
handled
it.
Yeah,
you're
probably
right.
So
they
say
you're

How

in-country?
Uh,
well,
four
tours,
so...
That's
like,
what,
1000

sounds
about
right.
Would
you
be

if
I
told
you

Do
you
ever
think...
...that
you
might
have
seen

or
done

that's
not

No.
What's
not
you?
I
was

to
meet

...that
haunts
me

blown
up,
I
had
both
of
my
And
right
before
the
explosion
went
off,
...grabbed
a
cigarette,
When
I
went
to
go
light
it,
And
it
took
the
whole
bottom
of
the
And
I
was
lucky
that
I
had
this.
I
mean,
it
still
fucked
up
my
right
hand,
CHRIS:
Yeah.
CHRIS:
Yeah,
I
still
smoke.

Miss.
Three
inches
to
the
right.
Come
on,
Wynn.
CHRIS:
Make
sure
you
keep
both
eyes
open.
Let
that
trigger
surprise
you.
We're
not
shooting
bad
guys,
How
about
the
Legend
stops
How
about
you
hit
one?

-
Hit!
Bull's-eye,
boy.
Damn,
if
that
don't
feel
like
Why
you
spending
I
know
you
got
a
family.
I
heard
you
had
a
boot
collection
I
saw
we
were
about
the
same
size.
Seriously,
man.
Why
do
you
do
it?
Well,
we
take
care
of
each
other,
right?
Let's
see
if
you
can't
hit
two
in
a
row.

Come
on,
man.
You
got
this.
-
Hit!
-
Hit!
Goddamn.
Who's
the
legend
now?

That's
a
title
you
don't
want.
Trust
me.
CHRIS:
Yo,
will
you
hop
down?
-
You
got
one
more?
-
All
right,
take
them
inside.

CHRIS:
It's
not
a
bad
life
out
here,
is
it?
Got
a
smile
on
his
face.
Looks
cheery
to
me.
Just
doing
his
thing.
Wave
goodbye
to
him.


CHRIS:
Oh,
babe,
is
that
you?
Yep-a-doo-dee!
Baby,
I
fucking
hurt
myself.
Shit.
-
What?
I'm
all
right.
Fuck.
-
Baby,
I'm
sorry.
What
happened?
Don't
you...!
Ooh!

CHRIS:
You
know
that
it's
a
heck
of
thing
COLTON:
That's
why
we're
gonna
do
it
together
All
right.
Now
remember,
you
gotta
be
calm...
...confident...
...and
you
never
hesitate.
All
right.
-
You
got
it,
bubba?
-
You
feel
good?
-
Shh.


Hands
in
the
air,
little
lady.
-
No
way.
Now,
you
drop
them
drawers.

But
you
drop
them
nice
and
easy.
Oh,
baby,
look
at
you.
Look
at
you.
Can
I
tell
you
something,
Chris?
-
Tell
it
to
the
judge.
No,
I
am
so
proud
of
you,
I'm
so
proud
of
you.
You're
such
a
great
father.
And
I
am
so
happy
And
I
also
know
how
hard
you
fought
You're
worth
fighting
for.
Now
tell
me
one
other
thing.
-
Did
you
pleat
those
jeans?
Yes,
ma'am.
-
Oh,
you're
just
a
regular,
old
cowboy
again.
-
Why
don't
you
really
drop
them
drawers.
I
got
four
minutes.
Ha-ha-ha.
No,
it
takes
two
minutes.
But
then
I
want
two
minutes
to
look
at
you.
Aren't
you
going
to
the
range?
Who
are
you
taking
out?
This
Marine.
His
mama
kept
asking
me.
She
parks
cars
at
the
elementary
school,
And
I
just
thought
today's
the
only
day
It'll
be
just
a
bit
of
the
afternoon.
COLTON:
Make
sure
you
keep
them
drawers...
-
Dad,
you
wanna
play
"Skylanders"?
I'll
do
it
when
I
get
back,
boy.
See
you're
on
Level
8,
and
that
I
wanna
win.
COLTON:
McKENNA:
Poke
the
bear!
-
Poke
the
bear!
Poke
the
bear!

-
No!
You're
supposed
to
roar,
like,
grr!
-
Grr!


Ooh.
All
right,
bubba.
-
Y'all
look
after
our
women,
okay?
Okay.
It's
a
big
responsibility.
All
right.
See
you
later,
baby.
-
I
love
you.
CHRIS:
How
are
you?
You
good?
We're
gonna
go
about
a
two-hour
drive...
...shoot
some
guns,
maybe
have
All
right.
Let's
go.
Thank
you.
