they
wanted
more.
More
land.
More
peoples
But
no
people
so
important
Thousands
died
on
that
field.
And
when
the
smoke
cleared
on
the
fourth
were
members
of
the

Romans,
impressed
by
their
bravery

AD
In
exchange,
these

They

For

second
part
of
the
bargain

The
day
has
come.
..but
also
their
sons,
to
serve
the
empire
as
knights.
I
was
such
a
son.
There
is
a
legend
that
He
has
seen
what
awaits
you,
Lancelot!
Lancelot!
Lancelot.
Don't
be
afraid.
I
will
return.

How
long
shall
we
be
gone?
not
including
the
months
it'll
take

Our
post
was
Britain
-
for
the
land
was
divided
by
a
73-mile
wall
to
protect
the
empire
from
So,
as
our
forefathers
had
done,
we
made
our
way
and
reported
ancestrally

for
the
first
Artorius,
or
Arthur.
15
YEARS
LATER
Ah,
as
promised,
the
bishop's
carriage.
-
Our
freedom,
Bors.
And
your
passage
to
Rome,
Arthur.

Argh!

Woads!

Yaa-rgh!
Yah!
Argh!
Argh!

Rus!
Aagh!
Rus!
Rus.
Gratia
plena,
Dominus
tecum.
Benedicta
Benedicta
tu
in
mulieribus.
Benedicta
tu
in
mulieribus...
Save
your
prayers,
boy.
Why
did
Merlin
send
you
south
of
the
wall?
Spill
my
blood
with
Excalibur
and...
make
this
ground
holy.
Pick
it
up.
Pick
it
up.
-
Bors.
That's
not
the
bishop.
God
help
us.
-
What
are
they?
You're
not
a
Christian,
are
you?
Does
this
really
work?

Nothing.
Maybe
I'm
not
doin'
it
right.

Arthur!
Arthur
Castus.
Your
father's
image.
I
haven't
seen
you
since
childhood.
Bishop
Germanius.
Welcome
to
Britain.
I
see
your
military
skills
Your
device
worked.
Ancient
tricks
of
an
ancient
dog.
And
these
are
the
great
Sarmatian
knights
I
thought
the
Woads
control
They
do,
but
they
Rome's
anticipated
withdrawal
from
Britain
-

Woads?
Men
who
want
their
country
back.
-
Who
leads
them?
A
dark
magician,
some
say.
Tristan,
ride
ahead
Please
do
not
worry,
Bishop.
Oh.
I've
no
doubt,
Commander.
No
doubt.
Dozens
don't
worry
me
Thousands?
Well,
now
that
we're
free
men,
-
You
do
that
every
night.
Too
much
of
myself
to
handle...
Well,
it's
a
problem.
No,
really,
it
is.
It's
a
problem.
-
It's
like
a
baby's
arm
holding
an
apple.

I
don't
like
him,
that
Roman.
If
he's
here
to
discharge
us,
-
Is
this
your
happy
face?
Galahad,
do
you
still
They
won't
scratch
their
arses
Why
don't
you
just
kill
him,
I
don't
kill
for
pleasure,
unlike
some.
Well,
you
should
try
it
someday.
-
It's
a
part
of
you.
It's
in
your
blood.
As
of
tomorrow
Ohh.
I've
often
thought
about
what
going
home
It's
different
for
Galahad.
I've
been
in
this
life
longer
than
the
other.
So
much
for
home.
You
speak
for
yourself.
It's
cold
back
there
Besides,
I
have,
I
think,
a
dozen
children.
Eleven.
You
listen.
When
the
Romans
leave
here,
I'll
be
governor
in
my
own
village
and
royal
arse-kisser.
Won't
you,
Dag?
First
thing
I
will
do
when
I
get
home
is
A
beautiful
Sarmatian
woman?
Why
do
you
think
we
left
in
the
first
place?

What
about
you,
Lancelot?
Well,
if
this
woman
of
Gawain's
I
expect
to
be
spending
-
His
wife
will
welcome
the
company.
Wondering
at
your
good
fortune
Is
that
before
or
after
I
hit
you
with
my
axe?

Where
you
been,
now?
Where
you
been?
And
what
will
you
do,
Arthur,
Give
thanks
to
God
that
I
survived
to
see
it.
You
and
your
god!
You
disturb
me.
I
want
peace,
Lancelot.
I've
had
enough.
-
You
should
visit
me.
It's
a
magnificent
place,
Rome.
Ordered,
civilised,
advanced.
A
breeding
ground
of
arrogant
fools.
The
greatest
minds
in
all
the
lands
to
help
make
mankind
free.
And
the
women?

Open
the
gate!
-
Welcome
back,
Arthur.
Lancelot.
Bishop,
please,
my
quarters
Oh,
yes.
I
must
rest.

-
Where
have
you
been?
-
I've
been
waiting
for
you.
Where's
my
Gilly?
Gilly.
-
You
been
fighting?
-
You
been
winning?
That's
my
boy.

Pelagius.
Very
kind
of
Arthur
to
give
up
his
room.
But,
of
course,
it
is
to
be
expected.

Sir,
I'm
here
to
escort
you
When
my
master
meets
with
your
knights,
and
he
must
be
seated
Your
master
can
plonk
his
holy
arse

His
Eminence,
Bishop
Naius
Germanius.
A
round
table?
Arthur
says
for
men
to
be
men
I
was
given
to
understand
There
were.
We
have
been
Oh,
of
course.
Arthur
and
his
knights
to
maintain
the
honour
of
Rome's
empire
Rome
is
most
indebted
To
your
final
days
Day.
Not
days.
The
Pope's
taken
He
inquires
after
each
of
you,
and
is
curious
to
know
if
your
knights
have
They
retain
the
religion
of
their
forefathers.
Of
course,
of
course.
They
are
pagans.
Hm?
For
our
part,
the
Church
but
you,
Arthur,
-
I
saw
his
image
in
your
room.
His
teachings
on
free
will
and
equality
I
look
forward
to
our
reunion
in
Rome.
Ah.
Rome
awaits
your
arrival
You
are
a
hero.
In
Rome,
you
will
live
out
your
days
Alas...
Alas,
we
are
all
but
players
Barbarians
from
every
corner
Because
of
this,
Rome
and
the
Holy
Father
from
indefensible
outposts,
What
will
become
of
Britain
I
suppose
the
Saxons
will
claim
it
soon.
-
Saxons?
In
the
north
a
massive
-
The
Saxons
only
claim
what
they
kill.
So
you
would
just
And
I
risked
my
life
for
nothing.
Hm.
Gentlemen,
your
discharge
papers
with
safe
conduct
But
first,
I
must
have
a
word
-
In
private.

Come.
Let's
leave
Roman
business
Let
it
go,
Bors.
Rome
has
issued
a
final
order
Final
order?
You
are
to
travel
north
and
return,
in
particular,
Alecto
is
the
Pope's
It
is
his
destiny
to
become
a
bishop,
On
this
day
you
ask
this
of
my
men.
On
this
day.
They
have
risked
their
lives
for
15
years
And
now,
on
the
day
they
are
to
be
which
is
far
more
dangerous
You
tell
me,
Bishop,
that
instead
of
freedom
I
offer
death?
If
your
men
are
truly
the
knights
If
it
is
God's
will.
Your
men
want
to
go
home,
and
to
get
home
they
need
to
cross
Deserters
would
be
hunted
down
like
dogs.
Will
you
defy
the
Pope,
Arthur?
Rome?
God
himself?
Everything
I've
done
has
been
Do
not
mistake
a
loyal
soldier
Would
you
leave
a
defenceless
at
the
hands
of
the
Saxons?
Fulfill
this
mission,
and
your
men
Their
papers
will
be
waiting
here
You
have
my
word.
You
think
very
hard
upon
that
vow,
Bishop,
Break
it,
and
no
Roman
legion,
papal
army,
nor
God
himself
will
protect
you.
That
is
my
word.
-

She
gave
me
fleas.
Best
of
three.

Who
wants
another
drink?
-

Ahh.
When
you
gonna
leave
Bors
My
lover
is
watching
you.
Mmm...
You
look
nothing
like
him.
You're
all
Bors.
-
Tristan...
I
aim
for
the
middle.
Oh,
they
want
more!
-
Here.
Be
a
mother
to
your
son.
Dagonet,
where
you
been?
Here,
please.
Sing.
-
No.
-
No,
I'm
trying
to
work.
Vanora
will
sing.
-

No,
no.
-

Sing
about
home.
Land
of
bear
and
land
of
eagle
Land
that
gave
us
birth
and
blessing
Land
that
called
us
ever
homewards
We
will
go
home
across
the
mountains
We
will
go
home
We
will
go
home
across
the
mountains
We
will
go
home
singing
our
song...

..hear
our
singing,
hear
our
longing
We
will
go
home
across
the
mountains
We
will
go
home

Arthur!
Arthur!
Arthur!
You're
not
Rus!
Knights...
brothers
in
arms...
your
courage
has
been
tested
Yes.
But
I
must
ask
you
now
for
one
further
trial.
Drink.
We
must
leave
on
a
final
mission
for
Rome
Above
the
wall,
far
in
the
north,
They
are
trapped
by
Saxons.
Our
orders
are
to
secure
their
safety.
Let
the
Romans
take
care
of
their
own.
Above
the
wall
is
Woad
territory.
Our
duty
to
Rome,
Our
pact
with
Rome
is
done.
Every
knight
here
For
you.
And
instead
of
freedom
Our
blood?
You
think
more
of
Roman
blood
Bors!
These
are
our
orders.
We
leave
at
first
light,
and
when
we
return
A
freedom
we
can
embrace
with
honour.
I
am
a
free
man!
I
will
choose
my
own
fate!
Yeah,
yeah.
If
it's
a
death
from
a
Saxon
hand
Listen,
if
you're
so
eager
to
die,
-
Enough.
Enough!
The
Romans
have
broken
their
word.
We
have
the
word
of
Arthur.
I'll
prepare.
Bors?
-
You
coming?
Can't
let
you
go
on
your
own!
I'm
just
saying
what
you're
all
thinking!
Vanora'll
kill
me.
And
you,
Gawain?
I'm
with
you.
Galahad
as
well.
O
merciful
God,
Not
for
myself,
but
for
my
knights,
for
this
is
truly
their
hour
of
need.
Deliver
them
from
the
trials
ahead,
and
I
will
repay
you
a
thousandfold
And
if,
in
your
wisdom,
you
should
determine
that
that
sacrifice
so
they
may
once
again
taste
the
freedom
I
will
gladly
make
that
covenant.
My
death
will
have
a
purpose.
Why
do
you
always
talk
to
God
Oh,
pray
to
whomever
you
pray
My
faith
is
what
protects
me,
Lancelot.
I
don't
like
anything
No
man
fears
to
kneel
Without
faith,
without
belief
in
something,
To
try
and
get
past
the
Woads
-
Them
we've
fought
before.
How
many
Saxons?
Hm?
How
many?!
Tell
me.
Do
you
believe
in
this
mission?
These
people
need
our
help.
-
It
is
our
duty
to
bring
them
out.
and
I
don't
give
a
damn
about
If
you
desire
to
spend
eternity
in
this
place,
but
suicide
cannot
be
chosen
for
another!
-
And
yet
you
choose
death
for
this
family!
And
freedom
for
myself
and
the
men!
How
many
times
in
battle
have
we
Outnumbered,
outflanked,
With
you
at
my
side,
we
can
do
so
again.
Lancelot,
we
are
knights.
What
other
purpose
do
we
serve
Arthur,
you
fight
for
a
world
Never.
There
will
always
be
a
battlefield.
I
will
die
in
battle.
Of
that
I'm
certain.
And
hopefully
a
battle
of
my
choosing.
But
if
it
be
this
one,
grant
me
a
favour.
Don't
bury
me
in
our
sad
little
cemetery.
Burn
me.
Burn
me
and
cast
my
ashes

Don't
touch
their
women.
We
don't
mix
with
these
people.
What
kind
of
offspring
Weak
people.
Half
people.
I
will
not
have
our
Saxon
blood
According
to
our
laws,
no
man
He
speaks
the
truth,
Father.
My
lord!
O,
my
lord!
God's
thanks,
my
lord.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Kill
her.

No!
No!

Are
you
challenging
me?
If
you
want
to
challenge
me,
As
long
as
my
heart
beats,
Or
I'll
cut
it
out.

We
are
three
days'
march
from
We
won't
camp.
The
wall
-
what
troops
are
stationed
there?
Light
Roman
infantry
and
possibly
Sarmatian
knights.
Arthur
Castus
is
their
leader.
Arthur?
Who
is
this
Arthur?
It
is
said
he
has
never
been
defeated
Why
should
I
trust
you?
You're
a
traitor
to
your
own
people.
Tell
my
father
of
the
Roman
estate.
Speak
up!
A
very
high-ranking
family
live
there.
They
are
of
great
importance
to
Rome.
Father,
their
ransom
I'll
attack
from
the
north
You
bring
your
men
down
here.
Burn
every
village,
kill
everybody.
Never
leave
behind
you
a
man,
woman
Saxon.
How
many?
Thousands.


Woads.
They're
tracking
us.

Where?
Everywhere.
Yaah!
Get
back!
Get
back!
This
way!

Yaah!
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Inish.
Devil
ghosts.
-
Why
would
they
not
attack?
We
should
have
killed
them,
Merlin.
There
might
be
a
purpose
No!
He
is
our
enemy!
So
is
the
Saxon!


Oh,
I
can't
wait
to
leave
this
island.
If
it's
not
raining,
it's
snowing.
And
that's
the
summer!
The
rain
is
good.
Doesn't
help
the
smell.
Hey,
Bors,
do
you
intend
to
take
Vanora
Oh,
I'm
trying
to
avoid
that
decision...
by
getting
killed.
Dagonet,
she
wants
to
get
married
Women!
The
children
already
have
names,
Just
Gilly.
It
was
too
much
trouble,
That's
interesting.
You
know,
I
never
thought
Now
I've
got
the
chance,
-
You'd
miss
'em
too
much.
I
like
the
little
bastards.
Especially
number
three.
-
He's
a
good
fighter.
I'm
going
for
a
piss.

-

Who
are
you?
Commander
of
the
Sarmatian
Knights,
Open
the
gate.

It
is
a
wonder
you
have
come.
Good
Jesus.
You
have
fought
the
Woads.
Our
orders
are
to
evacuate
you
But
that...
that
is
impossible.
-
Which
is
Alecto?
Alecto
is
my
son.
And
everything
we
have
is
here
in
the
land
-
Well,
you're
about
to
give
it
to
the
Saxons.
-
Then
Rome
will
send
an
army.
-
We
leave
as
soon
as
you're
packed.
Go
back
to
work!
All
of
you!
-
You
heard!
Go!
-
Go!
Go
back!
If
I
fail
to
bring
you
and
your
son
back,
So
you're
coming
with
me
if
I
have
to
tie
you
to
my
horse
and
drag
My
lord.
Lady,
my
knights
are
hungry.
Go.
Come!
Come.
Let
us
go,
hm?

Sir,
you're
famous.
I'm
Ganis.
I'm
a
good
fighter
and
I'm
smart.
Are
you
from
Rome?
From
hell.
-
Sir.
He's
our
village
elder.
What
is
this
punishment
for?
-
Answer
me!
Most
of
the
food
we
grow
He
asked
that
we
keep
My
arse
has
been
snappin'
at
the
grass
You're
from
Rome.
Is
it
true
and
that
it's
a
sin
to
defy
him?
I
tell
you
now.
Marius
is
not
of
God.
And
you,
all
of
you,
Help
this
man.
Help
him!
Now
hear
me.
A
vast
and
terrible
army
They
will
show
no
mercy,
spare
no
one.
Those
of
you
who
are
able
and
begin
to
move
south
Those
unable
shall
come
with
us.
You,
serve
me
now.

Right,
you
heard
him.
You
go
grab
enough
food
and
water
Let's
get
a
hurry
on,
else
we're
all
dead!
Come
on,
hurry.
They
have
flanked
us
to
the
east.
They're
coming
from
the
south,
They'll
be
here
before
nightfall.
-
How
many?
And
the
only
way
out
is
to
the
south?
East.
There
is
a
trail
heading
east
It
means
we
have
to
cross
behind
Saxon
Arthur,
who
are
all
these
people?
They're
coming
with
us.
Then
we'll
never
make
it.

-
Come
on,
get
back
to
work!
Move.
Move.
Move!
-
What
is
this?
No
one
goes
in
there.

What
are
you
doing?
Arthur,
we
have
no
time.
Do
you
not
hear
the
drums?
Dagonet.
Agh!
Agh!
-
Key.
From
the
inside.
-
You,
you...
go.
Move!
-
Gawain.
Exaudi
orationem
meam.
In
nomine
Dei
Patris
omnipotentis
Who
are
these
defilers
Out
of
the
way.
The
work
of
your
god.
Is
this
how
he
answers
your
prayers?
See
if
there's
any
still
alive.
How
dare
you
set
foot
in
this
holy
place?
-
There
was
a
man
of
God.
-

This
one's
dead.
And
you.
Arthur!
You
must
not
fear
me.
Water!
Give
me
some
water!
His
arm
is
broken.
And
his
family?
She's
a
Woad.
I'm
a
Roman
officer.
You're
safe
now.
-
You're
safe.
What
is
this
madness?
-
They're
all
pagans
here!
They
refuse
to
do
the
task
They
must
die
as
an
example!
You
mean
they
refused
to
be
your
serfs!
You
are
a
Roman.
You
understand.
And
you
are
a
Christian.
You!
You
kept
her
alive!
-

My
lord!
When
we
get
to
the
wall
Perhaps
I
should
kill
you
now
I
was
willing
to
die
with
them.
Yes,
to
lead
them
to
their
rightful
place.
It
is
God's
wish
Only
then
can
their
souls
be
saved.
Then
I
shall
grant
his
wish.
-
Wall
them
back
up.
I
said
wall
them
up!
Don't
you
see
it
is
the
will
of
God
-
Unhand
me,
defil...
They're
sinners!
We're
moving
too
slow.
The
girl's
not
gonna
make
it,
The
family
we
can
protect,
but
we're
We're
not
leaving
them.
If
the
Saxons
find
us,
we
will
have
to
fight.
Then
save
your
anger
for
them.
Is
this
Rome's
quest
or
Arthur's?

-
Arthur.
He
burns.
Brave
boy.
Some
of
your
fingers
are
out
of
place.
I
have
to
push
them
back.
If
I
don't
do
this,
there's
a
chance
-


They
tortured
me.
With
machines.
To
make
me
tell
them
things
that...
And
then...
I
heard
your
voice
in
the
dark.
I
am
Guinevere.
You
are
Arthur...
of
the
Knights
from
the
Great
Wall.
I
am.
The
famous
Briton
I
found
tracks
coming
from
the
south,
Horsemen
travelling
light
and
fast.
Could
be
Roman
cavalry.
Could
be
knights.
They
know
we're
after
them.
They'll
head
east
now,
God's
holy
work
has
been
defiled.
No,
please,
I...
Agh!
He
says
they
walled
him
up
in
a
building
Someone
who
goes
It's
him.
It's
Arthur.
Take
your
men
east.
Hunt
them
down.
I'll
take
the
main
army
to
the
wall.
-

And
the
monks?
I
am
a
servant
of
God!
Please,
I...
I
am
a
servant
of
God!

Unhand
me,
you
defiler!

Burn
it
all.
Yah!
My
father
told
me
great
tales
of
you.
Really?
And
what
did
you
hear?
Fairy
tales.
The
kind
you
hear
about
people
so
brave,
Arthur
and
his
knights.
A
leader
both
Briton
and
Roman.
And
yet
you
chose
your
allegiance
To
those
who
take
That
same
Rome
that
took
your
men
Listen,
lady,
do
not
pretend
How
many
Britons
have
you
killed?
As
many
as
tried
to
kill
me.
It's
the
natural
Animals
live!
It's
a
natural
state
of
any
man
I
belong
to
this
land.
Where
do
you
belong,
Arthur?
How's
your
hand?
I'll
live,
I
promise
you.
Is
there
nothing
about
my
land
Your
own
father
married
a
Briton.
Even
he
must
have
found
something

We'll
sleep
here.
-
Tristan.
It
is
here,
given
to
us
by
the
Pope.


You
betrayed
me.
He
means
you
no
harm.
Peace
between
us
this
night,
So
Rome
is
leaving.
The
Saxon
is
come.
The
world
we
have
known
Now
we
must
make
a
new
world.
Your
world,
Merlin,
not
mine.
To
find
peace?
My
knights
trust
me
Rome
was
my
enemy,
not
Arthur.
We
have
no
fight
between
us
now.
You
tell
that
to
the
knights
whose
bones
are
buried
in
this
earth.
We
have
all
lost
brothers.
You
know
nothing
of
the
loss
I
speak!
Shall
I
help
you
remember?
An
attack
on
a
village.
Mother!
Artorius!
Mother!
Mother!
I
ran
to
the
burial
mound
To
kill
you.
Father,
please
let
loose
your
sword.
I
feel
the
heat
of
that
fire
I
did
not
wish
her
dead.
She
was
of
our
blood,
as
are
you.
If
you
were
so
determined
to
leave
us
My
men
are
strong,
They
believe
you
can
do
anything.
To
defeat
the
Saxon
Why
do
you
think
That
sword
you
carry
is
made
of
iron
It
was
love
of
your
mother
Love,
Arthur.
Seize
him!
No!
No...
I
have
the
boy!
