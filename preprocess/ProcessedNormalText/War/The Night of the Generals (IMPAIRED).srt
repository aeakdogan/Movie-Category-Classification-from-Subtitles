MAN:
There's
some
more,
over
there!
Back
up,
around
the
other
way.

What's
the
odd
smell
The
smell
of
war,
Good
morning,
inspector.
I'm
sorry
to
call
you
Not
very
nice,
I'm
afraid.
The
work
of
an
amateur
Why
have
you
called
me?
The
dead
woman's
Polish,
This
is
not
a
case
Her
name
was
Kupiecka.
Kupiecka?
Oh,
yes,
she
was
a
prostitute
She
was
also
a
German
agent.
Killed
by
a
Polish
patriot?
Providing
the
Polish
patriot
Patriotism
has
been
known
One
hundred
knife
wounds
One
hundred?
It
would
be
impossible
As
you
can
see,
the
focus
was
on
the
woman's
using
what
appears
to
have
been
Thank
you,
doctor,

Find
anything?
Who
reported
the
murder?
A
man.
He
heard
screams
Identify
himself?
Who
lives
in
this
house?
One
of
you...
One
of
you
heard
a
scream
One
of
you
knows
something
about
If
that
person
does
not
tell
us
we
shall
assume
That
she
was
killed
by
a
member
and
that
you
are
all
In
which
case,
to
turn
the
whole
lot
of
you
The
man
who
has
one
minute
in
which
I
heard
the
scream.
This
one
terrible
scream.
And
then,
well,
I...
Then
later,
I
telephoned
the
police.
You
did
not
give
That
means
that
there
was
something
What
could
that
something
be?
There's
this
crack
in
the
door
And
naturally,
you
put
your
eye
I
saw
a
man
Describe
him,
please.
Describe
him,
please.
Just
the
lower
part,
Why
are
you
so
frightened
Because
it
was
a
uniform,
sir.
Like
yours.
A
German
officer?
German
officers
can
commit
Is
that
all
you
noticed?
That
the
trousers
were
like
mine?
Exactly
like
mine?
Not
exactly,
sir.
No.
There
was
a...
There
was
a
red
stripe
He's
lying.
Are
you
aware
that
only
German
Yes,
sir.
That's
why
I
was
afraid.
I
see.
It's
impossible.
A
German
general.
I
don't
think
we
need
to
take
After
all,
it
was
dark
on
the
stairs.
I
swear,
I'm
telling
the
truth.
And
I
believe
you,
until
Why
would
he
tell
a
dangerous
lie?
But
what
happens
if
What
happens?
Well,
justice
Justice
cannot
see
but
justice
can
sometimes
If
a
general
is
responsible,
Don't
worry,
Liesowski,
Good
night.

LIESOWSKI:
Well,
Inspector
for
not
quite
remembering
a
case
that
But
as
they
say,
It's...
It's
23
years
ago.
My
God,
how
time
passes.
When
I
left
the
police,
I
managed
to
keep
Always
glad
to
help
a
colleague.
Ah,
here
we
are,
inspector.
"Kupiecka,
Maria.
The
suspects
were...
Oh,
yes.
Yes,
now
I
remember.
A
German
general
was
seen
And
of
all
the
generals
in
Warsaw,
only
three
had
no
alibis
Here,
this
is
the
Lichnowsky
Palace.

It
used
to
belong
Then
later
it
became
a
museum.

As
you
can
see,
During
the
war,
the
German
headquarters
As
I
was
saying,
in
the
way
we
eliminated
suspects.

Had
to
proceed
tactfully,
of
course.

They
were
generals,
after
all,
And
Poland
was
occupied.

SOLDIER:
One
of
them
was
7th
Corps
commander.

He
was
a
Junker
of
the
old
school.

He
lived
like
royalty
in
the
palace,
The
night
of
the
murder,
His
chief
of
staff,
also
had
no
alibi
that
night.

Of
all
the
generals,
An
interesting
man.

General
Gabler,
a
message.
A
message
from
General
Tanz,
sir.
Thank
you,
Frulein
Neumaier.
It
seems
we
have
failed
You
have
read
it?
And
because
Incompetence?
They
don't
realize
that
that
I
am
given
only
the
Well,
that
was
General
Tanz's
word.
Not
to
mention
subordinates
And
because
of
our
failure,
the
Fhrer
has
ordered
How?
In
three
phases.
Using
the
most
Drastic?
Monstrous.

LIESOWSKI:
Lieutenant
General
Tanz
He
was
the
youngest
A
hero
at
Leningrad,
a
pet
of
Hitler,
We
Poles
detested
him.

He
arrived
in
Warsaw
on
the
day
He,
too,
was
unaccounted
for
First
roadblock,
set
up
there.
The
sniping
last
night
came
The
entire
quarter
We
shall
take
a
leaf
First,
we'll
mark
out
a
wide
perimeter,
then
That
should
set
the
fish
in
motion.
Of
course,
they'll
try
to
make
off
but
we'll
have
roadblocks
there
By
the
time
we've
closed
the
net,
we'll
have
them
exactly
With
their
backs
to
the
ghetto
wall.
Excuse
me,
general,
what
about
The
latest
estimate,
this
section
of
the
One
can
hardly
talk
of
a
normal
I
regard
the
experience
to
as
absolutely
indispensable.
Now,
about
those
to
be
on
the
safe
side,
I've
requested

What
are
you
scared
of,
I
think
they're
hungry.
What
food
do
we
have?
Bring
them
to
me.
Yes,
you're
quite
right,
Poor
little
devils.
Your
lunch,
sir.
Open.
Filth.

Your
hands.
Look
at
those
nails.
Not
even
Polish
children
Make
a
note.
Food
and
sweets
to
be
carried
It
does
no
harm
As
for
him,
he's
relieved
as

Now
he
enters

I
make
myself
clear?
As
for
our
immediate
requirements,
Once
they
are,
and
put

inhabitants
All
80,000?
General
Tanz,
but
just
as
a
matter
what
do
you
feel
is
the
exact
You've
read
the
memorandum.
And
what
does
That
phase
one
is
intended
to
search
houses,
Then
that
is
the
exact
purpose
An
excellent
plan,
by
the
way.
Much
only
I
was
never
given
the
But
am
I
to
understand
that
if
there
you
would
then
go
to
phase
two
which
would
mean
You
are
to
understand
Well,
uh,
isn't
that
Excessive.
You
will
be
aware
that
we
are
We
are
moving
ahead
Every
available
soldier
is
needed
Yet
here
in
Warsaw,
because
of
a
few
thousand

It
is
excessive
to
permit

Who
is
it?
Eleanore,
come
in.
Come
in,
my
dear.
My
wife
arrived
early
How
was
Berlin?
Eager
to
hear
the
good
news
that
always
follows
in
the
wake
When
I
heard
you
were
with
my
I
wanted
to
tell
you
myself

I
am
flattered,
ma'am.
I'm
honoring
you
If
you're
not
too
busy,
with
the
arrangements
In
your
honor,
General
Tanz.
Oh,
incidentally,
our
daughter,
She'll
be
at
the
soiree
too.
Well,
you
remember
her,
In
Berlin,
at
the
garden
party
Oh,
yes,
I
do
remember
her.
Sorry.
I
suppose
But
you
know
how
mothers
are.
Anxious
to
become
A
splendid
officer,
A
mother
would
be
proud
Married
to
a
war
memorial?
Excuse
me,
ma'am.
I
shall
continue
to
study
With
sinking
heart.
I
detest
that
man.
What
does
he
mean,
Oh,
the
black
book.
What
were
you
saying,
my
dear?
I
don't
dare
say
anything
One
must
protect
Another
mess
like
the
one
and
you
won't
have

What's
the
date?
Fortunately,
I
still
have
some
Indeed
you
have,
How
nice
that
you
are
here
at
last.
And
I
want
to
talk
to

you
should
know
that

you
are

Excuse
me,
general,
but

He
would
like
to
see
you.
What
does
he
want?
He
said
it
was
personal.
He's
most
persistent.
Tell
him,
some
other
time.
Yes,
sir.
By
the
way,
what
did
you
do
Do?
To
my
uniform?
Yes,
there
was
a
stain
But
since
you
obviously
it
could
only
have
been
lipstick.
Shall
I
match
the
color
with

Don't
be
absurd.
Anyway,
the
evidence
is
destroyed.
Aren't
you
glad
that
I
am
Of
course
I
am,
We
are
well-suited,
aren't
we?

I
wish
you'd
remember
to
knock.
Major
Grau
of
Intelligence
just
rang
What
about?
Tell
him
I'm
busy.
I
took
the
liberty.
Good.
Well?
Apparently,
he
rang
Wanted
to
see
the
log
for

I
told
the

clearing
it
first

us.
Good.
Yes,
that's
very
good.
Thank
you,
sergeant.

Yes?
Sir,
um,
about
my
cousin
Hartmann.
Your
cousin
Hartmann?
You
have
his
record,
sir.
Oh,
yes.
He's
just
out
of
hospital,
sir.
He's
on
temporary
duty
in
Warsaw.
I
had
hoped
that
we
could
make
And
by
some
extraordinary
he's
waiting
in
your
office
Yes,

Show
him
in.

Come

At

Well,
it's

I
see
that
you
are
a
German
hero

you
feel

all

Well,
that's
a
sensible
answer.
I
He
killed
40
Russians
Splendid.
I
imagine
that,
as
a
university
man,
Therefore,
I
shall
be
happy
Erm...
You
don't
want
to
go
I
should
prefer
to
remain
Actually,
general,
What
he
means
is...
I
mean,
I
don't
want
I'm
shattered.
My
world
is
toppling.
What
is
the
point
of
being
a
general
He's
still
a
bit
shaky,
Yes,
apparently.
Now,
your
cousin
suggested
but
I
should
think
you'd
be
anxious
No?
General,
what
he
really
means
is...
I,
um...
I
don't
seem
I
want
to
survive,
sir.
Well,
naturally.
We
all
do.
But
we
are
soldiers,
we
must
fight.
And
you
don't
want
to
go
back.
Is
this
the
"
reincarnation
I'm
sorry,
sir,
Even
in
a
good
cause?
Let
me
see
now...
According
to
your
papers,

at
Dresden?

yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I
think
I
have
But
one
which
requires
great
courage.
How
many
was
it?
Let
me
see.
Yes,
40
Russians
single-handed,
Now,
what
about
Chopin,
Didn't
he
write
the
Polonaises?
Can
you
play
them?
You
don't
sound
Well,
madam,
celebrating
the
glory
Well,
the
glory
of
Poland
isn't
No,
madam.
So
I
thought
Wagner.
I
remember
the
Fhrer
saying
to
me
"There's
no
such
thing
After
Parsifal?
I
must
say,
it's
unusual
who
also
knows
about
music.
Oh,
no,
don't
thank
me,
And
I
won't
until

I
dislike
being
a
bore,
major.
But
I
can't
help
wondering
Just
what
do
you
think
you're
doing?
But
if
you
say
anything
to
The
murderer
will
know
That's
the
point
of
the
exercise.
Good
evening,
sergeant.
But
look,
sir,
why
do
you
care
She's
better
off
dead

Have
you
ever
heard

A
number
of
disagreeable

They

That's
how

Well,

it
to

Wait
for
me

Mannheim.
You
must
be

If
the
generals
won't
see
me,
Well,
God

you,
Grau.
Better
have
some
champagne.
You
may
be
right,
sir.
General
Tanz,

my

Except
one.
May
I
ask

Well,

Who

I'm
sorry,

Why?
He
was

Yes.
Well...
Now,
there
are
some

yourself

you

Now,

you

What?
Oh,
yes!
Apparently.
OTTO:
Of
course,
inspector,
I
haven't

Hartmann
Don't
want
to
see
him,
But
I'll
say
one
thing,
he
had
the
most
I
don't
know
why.

Well,
he
wasn't
what
you'd
call
Too
skinny.

But
whatever
it
was
he
had,
I
think
they
must
have
got
together
Well,
things
were
like

Yes,

Oh,

it

It's

They

Do
you

Do
I

Good

no.

Instead

Oh,

Not

In

far.
Do
you

corporals?
Only
heroes

Just
think,
all
this

It
must

inspiring.
What's
the
matter?
You
know,
we

Why?
Because

No.
It's

It's
a
man,
a
girl,
a
war.
Two
boys
I
knew
It's
funny.
In
the
dark,
And
you
like
this
war?
No.
I
like
this.


No,
no!
What's
wrong?
Nothing.
I
thought
You're
shaking
like
a
leaf.
I'm
all
right
now.
What's
it
like
having
people
Noisy
bastards.
Good
morning.
Good
morning,
What's
it
like
having
people
Well,
what
do
you
think
it's
like?
Yes.
I'm
glad...
Well,
I'm
glad
that
you're
here.
But
you'll
be
going
back
soon,
Not
if
I
can
help
it,
I
won't.
Can
you
bear
the
truth?
Probably
not.
I'm
a
fraud.
When
they
opened
fire
on
us
It's
as
simple
as
that.
Then,
I've
no
idea
how,
I
was
hit.
It
was
like
a
door
slamming
in
Next
thing
I
remember
and
there
was
this
general
on
having
killed
40
Russians
You
see,
they
were
all
killed
Everyone
was
killed
except
me,
it
didn't
look
too
good
in
dispatches,
so
they
decided
The
one
who
ran
away.
So
now
what
do
you
think
Well,
that's
a
lovely
story.
Marvelous?
For
once,
the
joke's
on
them.
Come,
make
love
I
must
say
you
are,
It's
lucky
we
met.
What's
lucky
is
right
now.
You
know,
when
this
war
is
over...
Mm-mm.
It
will
never
end.
Well,
what
happened?
Did
you
see
them?
Generals
Gabler
and
Kahlenberge
are
I
told
you
they
wouldn't
see
you.
Where's
General
Tanz?
Look,
why
don't
It's
not
as
if
we
don't
have
Where's
General
Tanz?
In
the
old
city,
conducting
I
don't
trust
him.
Naturally,
in
the
field,
He
has
no
discretion.
Now,
now,
you
exaggerate.
He
will
only
go

is
a

Compassionate,

By
the
way,
I
was
in

gave

I

that

seems
to
have
no

he
disappears

A
perfect
maniac.

him

lost

revels

man
Anyone
who
has
the
power
to
destroy

not
need
such

I
could
be
wrong,
