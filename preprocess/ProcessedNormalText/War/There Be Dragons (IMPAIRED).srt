This
is
an
announcement
There
has
been
a

Ready.

But
luckily
for
me,
I
haven't
had
to
fight...
in
any
of
the
165
wars
My
father
wasn't
so
lucky.
When
he
was
a
young
man...
everyone
in
Spain
had
The
decision
may
have
taken
a
second...
but
the
consequences
He
never
talked
about
the
war...
until
I
was
asked
to
write
a
book
Josemara
Escriv.
And
then
he
began
to
talk
and
talk
and
talk.
And
that's
how
I
went
looking
for
a
saint
I
think
it
was
Oscar
Wilde
who
wrote...
"Every
saint
has
a
past...
and
every
sinner
has
a
future.

Josemara!
It's
the
Father.
Quick!
Quick!
Get
the

-
Leave
a
message.
Dad?
It's-
It's
me,
Robert.
Your
son.
I'm
in
Rome.
I'm
doing
a
book
on
Josemara
Escriv.
I'm-
I'm
coming
to
Madrid,
Dad...
and,
you
know,
I-I
want
Are
you
there?
Please,
Dad,
pick
up
the
phone.
Okay.
Well,
I'll
call
you
when
I
arrive.

And
why
this
interest
in
Escriv?
The
uproar
in
the
press
about
his
possible
You
know,
and
curiously,
he-
he
came
from
the
same
town
as
my
father.
Ah,
yes,
of
course.
To
be
honest,
l-
We
haven't
spoken
in...
eight
years.
So
I
moved
to
London
permanently,
Well,
he's
not
very
forgiving,
Eight
years,
huh?
-
Children?
I
don't
quite
see
myself
as
a
father.

Your
father
is
a
product
of
difficult
times.
You
should
try
to
understand
him.
Well,
I
do,
Monsignor.
I
do.
God
bless
you
in
your
quest.
-
And
give
my
regards
to,
uh-
Leila.
-
Good-bye.
-

Are
you
sure?
That's
Josemara
Escriv
in
the
middle.
And
that's
me
on
the
right.
And
on
the
left,
your
father.
Here's
another
one.
At
the
seminary.
-


Dad.
I'm
in
Madrid.
Been
a
long
time.
Listen.
I'm
close
to
the
apartment,
Why
would
you
write
a
book
about
him?
That's
what
I
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about.
Leave
it
alone,
Roberto.
Well,
I
found
out
that
you
were
and
you
never
told
me
-
Don't
you
think
that's
weird?
That's
why
I
left
after
a
year,
Roberto.
Why?
Was
it
because
of
the
civil
war?
-



Dr.
Leila
Azoulay,
please.
Which
department?
Mathematical
Physics.
Good
timing.
How's
Spain?
I
love
Spain.
How's
your
father?
I
love
Spain.
Tell
me.
He
doesn't
want
me
to
do
At
least
you
two
spoke.
That's
progress,
no?
He
knows
something
about
Josemara,
damn
it.
I
know
he
does.
Why
can't
he
just
tell
me?
I
could
wrangle
the
weekend
away.
Want
me
to
come
out?




No!
Damn
it.






I
was
nine
A
long
time
ago.
Roberto,
you've
often
told
me
What
I've
never
told
you
-
Manolo!
Manolo!
-
So
if
you
want
to
hear
about
the
past...
-
I'll
tell
you.
-
But
I
warn
you,
there
be
dragons.
Are
you
okay?
Manolo!
-
Manolo!

-
I
got
you,
Josemara.
-
I'm
gonna
get
you.
There
was
one
day
he
almost
killed
me.


Good
driving,
boy.
Come
on!



Feels
like
a
Taurus,
Manolo.

Stop!
-
Manolo,
are
you
all
right?
Josemara,
I'll
speak
to
your
father.
I
hate
this
backwater.
I've
half
a
mind
to
sell
up
-
Can
I
drive
again,
Papa?



See?
There
are
many
kinds
of
dragons
She
scares
me.
Don't
be
scared,
Manolo.
How
many
dragons
are
there,
Abileyza?
Many,
Josemara.
But
what
matters
is
how
you
face
them,

as
if
they
really
existed.
A
quarter
of
a
century
passed
But
things
happened
in
Josemara's
life...
that
meant
he
understood
this
before
I
did.

No!
No!

My
baby!
Why?

I
lost
a
baby
brother.
In
those
days,
death
was
part
of
life.

Do
you
hate
God
now?
No,
dearest.
I...
love
him
very
much.
Will
you
hate
him
when
he
takes
me
away?
Come
here.
I'm
sorry
about
your
sister.

The
manager
was
a
strange,
old
guy-
Honorio.
We
know
we
like
what's
here.
We
know
that
we
want
what's
here.
But
what
is
here
exactly?
Just
sit
this
on
your
tongue...
for
five
seconds.
Hmm?
Now,
chew...
three
times.
Manolo,
you
taste
what?
Almond.
Almond?
Cinnamon.
Cinnamon?
Don't
scoff.
Yes.
Cinnamon.
All
right,
off
you
go.
Josemara,
you
stay
here.
I
scolded
Manolo
for
mocking
not
because
he
couldn't
experience
it.
Ah,
now,
look
at
this.
Ugly,
isn't
it?
Just
a
poor,
ordinary
little
bean.
Yet,
patience...
skill,
hard
work
and
love...
can
unleash
the
divine
flavors
There.
Do
you
understand
the
lesson?
But
not
everyone
has
a
taste
And
why
is
that,
I
wonder?
Manolo!
Manolo!
Wait
for
me!
Stop!
Manolo!

was
stealing
Josemara's
dad's
chocolates.
But
then
his
dad
went
bankrupt
And
I
wasn't
allowed
to
play
My
dad
thought
poverty
was
contagious.
-
He
said
that
Josemara
wasn't
one
of
us.
-

-
And
my
dad
could
be
quite
persuasive.

My
dad
had
more
money...
more
cars,
more
houses.
But
Josemara
had
more
dad.
A
seed
of
envy
began
to
grow
in
me.
In
a
child's
heart,
many
seeds
are
planted.
You
never
quite
know
what
will
grow.
Hmm.
I'm
sure
he
didn't
see
us.



I'll
tell
you
the
story
as
he
told
it
to
me.
One
cold
winter
night...
Josemara
saw
footprints
He
followed
them.
And
then
he
saw
someone.
And
he
felt
that
God
was
calling
him.
It
wasn't
unusual
in
those
days...
for
a
young
man
to
want
to
become
a
priest.
Like
it
or
not,
most
young
men
were
celibate.
At
least
as
a
priest...
you
got
paid
for
it.
The
priesthood
was
a
career
option.
But
for
Josemara,
it
was
a
sacred
calling.


-

You
are
incorrigible.
Do
you
know
what
you're
taking
on,
Son?
Yes,
Papa.
No
one
to
love.
Human
love,
I
mean.
No
family
of
your
own.
-
No
sons.
And...
is
this
the
wisest
time
Probably
not.
Is
your
father
still
selling

Hey,
careerist.
-

Fight!
Fight!

Fight!
Fight!
Fight!

What
lesson
do
you
draw
from
this?

Bravo.
Torres,
what
did
you
call
Seminarian
Escriv?

A
vain
little...
pig.
And
you-
what
did
you
call
Torres?
A
backstabbing
careerist.
Sorry,
Monsignor.
I
can't
stand
his
type.
A
backstabbing
careerist.
That
sums
him
up,
eh?
What,
his
father
is
rich,
so
he
thinks
That's
not
the
summing
up
Yet,
isn't
someone
else
his
Father?
And
yours?
Remember,
the
withholding
of
forgiveness...
is
the
one
thing,
as
our
Lord
made
clear...
that
will
not
be
forgiven.
So...
do
you
think
that
two
hotheads,
can
be
good
priests?
Well,
I
think
it's
possible.
I
really
do.



No,
no,
no,
no!
Get
away!
-

-
and
let
my
factory
get
back
to
work.
That's
your
job!
Scum!
-
Go!
-
What?
Scum!
Scum!
Manolo,
when
push
comes
to
shove...
a
man
has
only
one
duty...
and
that
is
to
choose
the
winning
side.
Eh?
-
Come
on.

-
Hi.
-
Good
to
see
you.
-


They're
my
dad's
files
from
the
'50s.
There's
more
at
the
hotel.
-
He
actually
sent
this
stuff
to
you?
You
are
making
progress.
What's
the
reason
for
the
change?
I
don't
know.
"Foundation
for
the
Sick."
God,
such
a
different
world.

Josemara
wrote
to
me
I
never
wrote
back,
In
his
letters
he
told
me
Honorio.

Josemara.
Oh,
look
at
you.
Give
me
your
hand.
How's
my
old
employer?
Papa
died
four
years
ago,
Honorio.
Ah.
I
said
my
first
Mass
for
him.
Do
you-
you
remember...
The
chocolate
bean?
Of
course.
It
was
a
great
lesson.


I'm
sorry.
That
won't
work.
Why
not?
Because...
I'm
Jewish.
You
know,
the
love
of
my
life
is
Jewish.
Once
I
thought
of
conversion...
but
I
couldn't
dishonor
my
father.
Honoring
our
parents
is
the
sweetest
precept
-
But
Jesus
Christ-
when
I
stand
before
him,
will
he?
What
I
know
for
sure
is
that...
he
loves
you
very
much.
Thank
you.
I
was
afraid
of
dying
here
alone.

Please
pray
with
me,
Father.
-

with
all
your
heart...
and
with
all
your
mind...
and
with
all
your
soul.
Our
Father...
who
art
in
heaven...
hallowed
be
thy
name.
Thy
kingdom
come,
as
it
is
in
heaven.
Good
night,
Father.
-

Lord,
open
my
eyes.
I
am
such
a
blind
donkey.
For
so
long
I
have
felt
you

Do
you
have
a
purpose
but
I'm
too
blind
to
see
it?
You
were
there
tonight,
Lord.
I
felt
you
there.
Please
be
with
me
now.
Please
show
me.

Just
a
poor,
ordinary
little
bean.
Patience,
skill...
hard
work
and
love...
can
unleash
the
divine
flavors
hidden
within.
Do
you
understand
the
lesson?


Yes.
Yes,
I
see.
Everyone
and
everything.
Everyone
and
everything.
Everyone
and
everything...
for
your
glory.
Your
arms
open
to
all.
One
by
one.
-
Thank
you,
Lord.
So
this
group
of
red-blooded
to
offer
themselves
completely
to
God...
in,
uh,
apostolic
work,
including
celibacy?
Yes,
Vicar.
That
was
the
choice
I
gave
them
-
Really?

How
many?
Uh...
three.
Three.


My
worry


Yes,
Your
Excellency.
They
will
live
separately,
and
will
also
be
open
to
married
people.

Living
in
the
same
institution?
It's
not
an
institution
or
a
movement.
It's
just
a
family
of
individuals.
And
no,
married
couples
will
live
at
home.

Protestant-
that
God
is
to
be
found
in
the...
well,
vanities
of
daily
life.
Hmm?
Outside
holy
orders.
No
vows.
Hmm?
No...
habits.
Well,
Jesus
spent
most
in
Nazareth.
God's
world
is
so
full
of,
uh-


God's
world
is
so
full
of
goodness.
If
we
do
them
for
love,
Small
but
regular
acts
of
love
between
friends,
between
strangers...
each
revealing
the
beauty
of
his
creation.
And
you
want
to
open
Yes.
And
one
day
in
New
York,
Paris...
London
and-and...
Tokyo.
It's
a
long
way
to
Tokyo.
And,
uh...
no
money
yet
to
speak
of.
Well,
I
can't
provide
any.
No,
I
didn't
come
to
ask
for
that.
I
ask
merely
for
your
permission-
And
you
shall
have
them.
Father
Escriv...
I
offer
you
a
job
as
my
secretary.
In
time
this
will
lead
to
a
career...
that
might
grant
you
the
influence
to
realize
this-
this
dream
of
yours.
So,
what
do
you
say?
I
said
no,
thank
you.
Santi.
Now,
it
won't
be
easy,
I
know.
But
I'll
always
see
that
there's
a
roof
No?
Huh?
-
Josemara-
I
have
an
idea.

Crescit.
Good.
Okay.
Agustin.
Pec-
Pec-
-
Pecunia.
-

You
will
learn,
and
I
will
learn
to
teach
it.

Oh,
no.
Damn
it!
Stay
here.
-


Sorry.
But
I
can't-
The
smell.
I
can't.
-


How's
your
Latin?
Go.

No.
Go
on.
Go.
-
Go,
go,
go.
Go.
-

-

Drive
through
them!
Don't.
Thugs.
How
can
you
do
this?
Then
God
is
just.
-

Damn
unions.


Papa.

Papa.

What?
What
did
the
doctor
say?
That
it's
God's
will.
Get
out
of
here.
Manolo,
please.
Get
out
of
here.
Get
out!
Get
out!

Papa.
Papa?
Papa.
##

Thank
you.
Good
afternoon,
brother.
Brother?
Uh,
Josemara.
I
know
who
you
are,
Josemara.

I
heard
your
sad
news,
Manolo.
You
have
been
in
my
prayers.
Thank
you.
however
sincere.
Manolo,
-
Struggles?
Doubts.
Struggles.
Josemara,
I
blundered
into
the
seminary
I
left
because
I
wasn't
priest
material.
As
you
know.
Well,
maybe
not,
but
it
doesn't
mean

You
know...
my
recurring
nightmare
No,
Josemara.
Unlike
you,
But
I
appreciate
your
concern.
It's
not
concern,
Manolo.
It's
love.
Our
Lord
said
love,
And
it's
what
we
owe
each
other.
No?
Josemara,
the
truth
is...
we
are
born
alone
and
we
die
alone.
All
we
have
in
between
The
rest
is,
frankly,
sentimental
drivel.
-
##

Call
on
me.
I'll
come,
I
promise.
Josemara.
You
don't
give
up,
do
you?
It
may
help
you
to
find
some
meaning
Suffering
has
no
meaning.
It's
meaningless.
If
you
can
show
me
otherwise,
That's
my
promise.
I
know
what
it
is
to
be
angry
at
life.
Please
be
careful
Sheep.

Around
the
time
I
also
got
a
call-
from
an
old
friend
of
my
father's.
Ah,
Torres.
-
Good
morning.
##

-
Well?
Yes.
You.
But
I
expected
something
more.
With
the
king
gone,
Which
we
will
now
re-create,

But
our
government's
elected.
It's
popular.
Its
time
is
over.

-
Tap
it
and
see
the
maggots
emerge.
Socialists
who
want
a
socialist
state.
Stalinists
who
want
a
Stalinist
state.
Anarchists
who
want
no
state
at
all.
Manolo,
we
want
to
create
a
new
Spain.
-

A
united
Spain.

-
ordered,
vigorous.
-

##


-
We
called
them
communists.
Really,
the
world
was
much
But
many
preferred
to
see
it
Three
years
later,
most
of
them
civilians.
But
even
in
times
like
these...
some
people
are
more
interested

Uh,
yes,
I
was,
but,
uh,
-
What
was
that?
-
Who
needed
a
hat.
-

Yes,
and
some
lunch.

Sit
down,
please,
Pedro,
Isidoro.
Well,
uh-
-
So?
This
group
that
keeps
you
from
your
homes-
We
don't
have
a
name,
Mama.
We
just
refer
to
it
as
God's
work.
Latin
would
sound
better.
Uh,
Opus
Dei.
##

##
Well,
your
donkey
may
lack
funds...
but
the
work
has
found
its
name.

##

Vamos.
Est
bien.

Now
it
was
my
turn
to
strike.
##
-

-
Come
here,
scum!
-
Put
the
hood
on
him!

Yeah,
we'll
show
you
how
just
God
is.
-
In
the
boss's
car.
Let's
go!


Where's
your
gun?
This
is
not
a
game.
He
killed
your
father.
Ah,
damn
it.
-


Do
it,
damn
it.

Pedro.
-

You're
crazy.
You're
crazy.
He'll
hate
the
whole
idea.
Well,
let's
ask
him.
Ask
me?
This.
We're
gonna
put
them
up
Look.

-
A
crusade?
Using
the
cross
to
incite
hatred
and
anger-
Well,
maybe
not.
But,
Father,
the
government
No,
it
isn't.
Come
on,
Pedro.
If
we
don't
do
something,
-
Or
worse-
traitors.
-
Traitors?
That's
what
people
are
saying.
Standing
by
while
the
church
gets
attacked-
how
is
that
being
a
good
Catholic?
Pedro,
is
it
understandable
Yes,
Father,
but-
Juan,
is
it
understandable
Yes,
of
course.
Good.
So
the
question
is,

And
lunch
is
ready,
so
sit
down
now.
So
we
just
let
the
matter

No.
Look,
I'm
not
going
God
gave
each
of
you
a
brain
Why?
So
that
you
can
and
take
personal
responsibility
for
them.
But
before
rushing
to
act-
before
trying
to
change
the
world-
first
think
about
changing
yourselves.
We're
building
something
vital
here
together.
Now-
especially
now-
we
have
to
be
sowers
of
peace
and
joy.
And
lunch,
Mama.
-
Father!
They've
started
killing
priests.
-
What?

-
Where?
Let
me
see.
So,
what
do
we
do
now,
Father?
Exactly
what
I
just
said,
Juan.
Please.
Bless
us,
O
Lord,
and
these
thy
gifts...
which
we
are
about
to
receive...
from
your
bounty,
through
Christ
our
Lord.
-
Amen.




Found
a
cockroach.
Hey,
watch
where
you're
going.
How
about
we
squash
it,
eh?

-
Priest.
-
A
little
priest?
-
Whoa!
-
I'm
sorry.
So,
what
have
we
got
there?
Huh?
-
Come
on.
Show
us.
Give
me
the
packet,

I'm
not
a
parasite.
I
have
to
work
for
a
living,
Work
for
a
living?
That's
enough!

That's
enough!
Please!
Get
on
the
next
one.

Relax.

Relax,
old
man.
See
you
later,
priest.
-
I'm
on
your
side.

-
We'll
get
you
next
time.

They've
got
a
thing
-
Can't
say
I
blame
them.
All
part
of
creating
Exactly.
And
how
will
uncivilized
behavior
Can't
make
an
omelet
without
breaking
eggs.
No.
Life
is
not
an
omelet.
And
people
are
not
eggs.
Okay.
Hey,
if
I
was
you...
I'd
stop
wandering
about
It
won't
protect
you
anymore.
I
don't
wear
this
for
protection.
You
got
balls
for
a
bourgeois
ass.

One,
two.
One,
two.
One,
two.
One,

One,

One,
two.
Thank
you,
Father.
One,
two.
Halt.

Hello?
Juan?
Paco?
Happy
birthday!

It's

birthday.
Please.
Come
on.
Josemara...
as
your
brother,
I
have
been
chosen...
to
ask
you
to
celebrate
by
removing
your
shoes.
-

-
Take
them
off.
-
Shoes
off.
Come
on,
Father.
-
Yes.
-
The
shoes.

-
Behold
a
simple
shoe.
But
is
it
what
it
seems?
-
Yes.
No.
It
is,
in
fact,
a
hole.

A
hole
masquerading
as
a
shoe.
Oh!
And
a
hole
surrounded
by
leather.

Shh!
Shh!
But
also
a
testament

and
shine.
-
Yes!
And
in
pity
for
this
innocent
shoe...
we
have
also
pooled
together
for-
-
Ta-da!
-

What
nice
shoes.

Santi!

Get
down!

There's
something
inspiring
even
when
it's
not
yours.
I
can't
describe
that
ecstasy
even
when
it's
the
enemy.
There's
no
better
feeling.
Well,
apart
from
one.
Cat
got
your

comrade?

what
do
you
know
of
suffering
and
death?
How
they
will
taunt
you-
"Is
it
worth
it?"
They
will
ask
again
and
again,
And
what
will
fill
your
hearts
-
Hatred
of
oppression?
Of
tyranny?
-
Hatred
of
those
who
treat
us
like
animals-
Denying
our
hopes
and
stifling
our
lives?
Yes!
But
more.
It
will
be
faith-
faith
that
a
new
world
will
be

And
comradeship,
my
brothers
and
sisters.
And
courage-
courage
to
burst
from
our
cages...
and
set
ourselves
free
to
live
noble...
as
the
eagle
hovering
-
Or
die
in
the
attempt!

We

Oh,
God.
I'm
such
a
coward.
Me
too.
I
don't

right
about
this.
You
read
the
newspapers.
They
don't

there,
Then
don't
call
me

Call
me

Come
on,
Father.
I

Mariano.

Father,
they'll
be
safe.
Don't
worry.
