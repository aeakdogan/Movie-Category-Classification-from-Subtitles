If

And
in
this
world,
There's
something
something
I
If
you
felt
But
it's
not

A

SIR

this?
I
am...
No
one
knows.
I
shall
ask
the
Queen
Where
will
you
go?
To
my
I'm
a
ward
of
the
Queen.
I
can't
marry
As
for
having
a
child,
your
child...
SIR
WALTER:
All
I
know
Please,

You

said
to
me,
Do

Of
course,
I
remember.
I
ask

ship.
Forget
me.

15,000
men
They

my
permission
Before

Do

Please,
This

BESS:
As
you
wish,
Get

mean
Because,
by
God,
If
that
is
You
want
me
to
tell
only
what
Your
Majesty
I
will
not

a
toy
Have
I

Just

outcome
The
shadow

ghosts,
Please,
just
The
forces
that

How
can
I
promise
even
though
But
this
much
When
the
storm
breaks,
Some
are
dumb
Some
flee.
Some
hide.
And
some
spread
their
wings
You
are
a
wise
man,
And
you,
madam,
SENTRY:
Light
the
beacon!

My
lords,
I
can
offer
you
This
Armada
carries
in
its
bowels
God
forbid
it
succeeds,
for
then
there
will
be
of
conscience
or
of
thought.
We
cannot
be
defeated.
The
bells

ring
Laborers

resolved
in
the
midst
to
live
or
die

While
we
stand
together,
Let

come

And
when
this
day
we
meet
again

Always.

your
Queen.
I
am
myself.
