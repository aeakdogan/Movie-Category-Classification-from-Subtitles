MAN:
Smashed
by
the
wars.

Now
I
am
the
keeper
of
his
body...
...embalmed
here,
in
the
Egyptian
ways.
I
followed
him
as
Pharaoh
BOY:
I
am
the
victor...
...but
what
does
it
all
mean,
when
...the
great
cavalry
charge
...or
the
mountains
...when
we
crossed
He
was
a
god,
Cad
mos...
...or
as
close
as
anything
"Tyrant!"
they
yell
so
easily.
I
laugh.
No
tyrant
ever
gave
back
so
much.
What
do
they
know
of
the
world,
It
takes
strong
men
to
rule.
Alexander
was
more,
He
changed
the
world.
Before
him,
there
were
tribes...
...and
after
him,
all
was
possible.
There
was
suddenly
a
sense
the
world
...and
be
better
for
all.
Eighteen
great
Alexandria
he
built.
It
was
an
empire,
not
of
land
A
Hellenic
civilization...
...open
to
all.
But
how
can
I
say
it?
...to
be
young,
to
dream
big
dreams?
To
believe
when
Alexander
looked
you
Anything-

In
his
presence,
by
the
light
of
Apollo,
Truly...
...I've
known
many
great
men
And
only
now,
when
old,
...who
this
force
of
nature
really
was.
Or
do
I?
Did
such
a
man
as
Alexander
exist?
We
idolize
him,
Men,
all
men,
reach
and
fall...
...reach
and
fall.
In
the
East,
the
vast
Persian
Empire
In
the
West,
...Thebes,
Athens,
Sparta,
For
100
years
now,
the
Persian
kings
...with
their
gold
to
fight
as
mercenaries.
It
was
Philip,
the
one-eyed,
...uniting
tribes
of
illiterate
sheepherders
With
his
blood
and
guts,
...that
brought
the
devious
Greeks

He
then
turned
his
eye
on
Persia...
...where
it
was
said
...on
his
throne
in
Babylon,
It
was
from
these
loins
of
war


Some
called
his
mother,
...and
said
that
Alexander
was
the
But
truly,
there
was
not
a
man

father
and
son,

side,
OLYMPIAS:
Trust
the
ones
who
give
you
love
Life
has
just
begun,
son
Her
skin
is
water.
Her
tongue
is
fire.
She
is
your
friend.
Take
it.
If
you
hesitate,
she
will
strike.
Never
hesitate.
Yes.
They
are
like
people.
You
can
love
them
for
years.
...but
still,
they
can
turn
on
you.
Don't
hurt
her.
Good.
Come.

He
calls
me
a
barbarian.
Philip
makes
a
mockery

Women
are
the
only
ones

My
little
Achilles.


Stay,
Alexander,
down.
Down.
What
is
it
you
want?
Six
months.
Did
you
miss
me?
-
No.
Not
here!
King
of
what?
Sheepherders?


-
I
am
of
Achilles'
royal
blood.
-
You
are
nothing
but
a
drunken
whore.
You
10-tutted
bitch
from
Hades!
Which
god
could
I
curse
to
Do
you
think
people
respect
you?
You
think
they
don't
know

Ha--?
Damn
your
sorceress
soul!
You
keep
him
I
told
you
not!

-
You'll
obey
me.
You'll
obey
me,
or
I'll
kill
you

No!
No!
Stop!
Papa!

-
Obey
me!

In
the
name
of
the
gods.
He
will
never
be
yours!
Never!
In
my
womb,
I
carried
my
avenger!

PTOLEMY:
...I've
come
to
believe
it
was
in
friendship
You
don't
need
much
to
fight.
When
you're
in
the
front
ranks
...facing
some
Northern
...courage
won't
be
in
the
lining
It's
in
the
heart
of
a
man.
You
don't
need
to
eat
every
day
You
don't
need
to
lie
in
bed
...when
you
can
have
some
...after
a
forced
night
march.
Come
on,
Alexander.
Come
on.
Who
will
respect
you
as
a
king?
The
first
rule
of
war
is
to
do
what
you

Good.
That's
it.
Well
done,
Sophistication.
Good
wrestling.
Come,
come,
come.
You
did
well,
but
you
lost.
Now,
both
of
you,
congratulate
Would
you
want
me
to
let
you
win,
You're
right.
But
I
promise
you,
I
will
beat
PTOLEMY".

by
Sophistication's
thighs.
Although
an
inferior
race...

is
it
possible
that

into

Sea
Now,
if
only
these
frogs

is
it,
master,
in

All

From

Why?
Unless
there
was
truth
to
them?
Tales
of
Amazons?
No,
Alexander.
Only
common
people
believe
these
tales,
We
are
here
precisely
to
educate
But
if
we
are
superior
to
the
Persians,
It
is--

has
always
been

East

a
way
of

ARISTARCHUS:
-
Master?
-
Master!
-
Why
are
the
Persians
so
cruel?
That
is
not
the
subject
for
today,
But
it
is
true
that
the
Oriental
races
...and
their
slavish
devotion
Excess
in
all
things
That
is
why
we
Greeks
are
superior.
We
practice
control
of
our
senses.
Moderation,
we
hope.
CASSANDRA:
-
Was
he
not
excessive?
He
dominates
others
so
completely
that

with
grief
over

seriously
endangers

you
say
the
love
between
Achilles
When
men
lie
together
in
lust,
...and
does
nothing
Nor
does
any
other
excess,
Cassandra,
But
when
men
lie
together...

and

is
pure
and
excellent.
When
they
compete
to

from

No
one

ride
that
beast,
Not

been
beaten

too
often.
My

High-spirited
and
worthy
For
three
and
a

talents...
...I
couldn't
make
a
profit
Why
would
I
want
such
a
beast?

Do
I
seem
so
old?
MAN
1:
Stay
down,
stay
down.

A
broken
neck
comes
free.
He's
too
Buy
him
for
me,
Father.
I'll
ride
him.
And
if
you
don't?
-
I'll
pay
for
him
myself.
I'll
pay
you!
I
tell
you,
that
horse
can't
be
ridden,
He
can
be
ridden.
By
me.
If
you
can
rule
that
horse,
...at
half
the
price.
That
horse
will
kill
him,
Philip.

He'll
break
the

don't
like
your
shadow,
do
you?
It's
like
a
dark
spirit
Do
you
see?
That's
us.
It's
just
a
trick
of
Apollo's.
He's
the
god
of
the
sun.
Shh.
But
I'll
show
you
how
to
outwit
him,
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.

Hydrocephalus.
That's
what
I'll
call
you.

Hydrocephalus
and
Alexander.
Come
now,
let's
ride
together.

He's
got
some
Titan
in
him
yet.
At
talus!
Leviticus!
For
Zeus'
sake,

Now,
Hydrocephalus,
show
them.


My
son.
My
Son!
You
remember
Achilles.
-
He's
my
favorite.
Because
he
loved
Patrols
And
his
fate?
That
he
must
die
young
Did
he
have
a
choice?
Yes.
He
could
live
a
long
life,
You
dream
of
glory,
Alexander.
There's
no
glory
without
suffering,
One
day,
I'll
be
on
walls
like
these.
Prometheus
stole
the
secret

made
Zeus

angry...

chained
Prometheus
to

Even

he
accomplished

was
punished
with
madness,
Poor
Herakles.
Great
Herakles.
All
greatness
comes
from
loss.
Even
you,
the
gods
will
When
I'm
king
like
you,
Father?
Don't
rush
the
day,
boy.
You
risk
all.
My
father
threw
me
into
battle
When
I
killed
my
first
man,
he
said:
"Now
you
know."
I
hated
him
then,
A
king
isn't
born,
Alexander.
He's
made
by
steel
and
by
suffering.
A
king
must
know
It's
lonely.
Ask
Herakles.
Ask
any
of
them.
Fate
is
cruel.
No
man
or
woman
can
be
too
powerful
They
laugh
when
you
rise
too
high...
...and
crush
everything
What
glory
they
give,
They
make
of
us
slaves.
OLYMPIAS:
He
will
marry

spring,
...and
when
her

is
born...
...her
sweet
uncle
At
talus
will
convince

himself
as

And
you...
...you
will
be
sent
on
...against
some
monstrous
...to
be
mutilated
in
one
more
And
I,
no
longer
queen,
...with
your
sister
and
the
remaining
I
wish
sometimes
you
could
see
The
truth
is,
he's
taken
nothing
from
you
The
only
way
is
to
strike.
Announce
your
marriage
Beget
a
child
of
pure
blood.
He
would

he
would
have
no
choice
There
is
still

Eurydice
was
perfect.

Say
nothing.
You're
right.
Forgive
me.

mother
loves
too
much.

shall

sing
to

could

Since
I
was
a
child,
I've
been
groomed
Oh,
my
poor
child,
...cursed
by
your
greatness.
Take
my
strength.

You
must
never
confuse
your
feelings
A
king
must
make
public
gestures
I
know,
but
you
will
be
19
...and
the
girls
already
say
you
don't
I
understand.
But
if
you
go
to
Asia
without
leaving
Sophistication
loves
me,
...not
who.
Loves?
Loves?
In
the
name
of
Dionysus...
...understand
how
Philip
thinks,
Your
life
hangs
in
the
balance.
-
His
spies
are
inside
your
closest
circle.
I'm
his
only
worthy
son.
You
crazed
woman.
He'd
never
hurt
me.
Even
if
Eurydice
had
a
boy,
Yes,
and
you
would
be
40.
Old
and
wise
like
Armenian.
Like
you
now,
He
will
never
give
you
Never.

Come,
Alexander,
If
only
thirst
could
quench
sorrow,

There's
only
one
thing
better
...and
that's
the
taste
You'll
find
it
far
sweeter
than
self-pity.
Sassanian,
you
bore
me.
Alexander,
I
found
you
the
right
girl.
-
What's
your
name,
darling?
-
What's
your
name?
I
love
you,
my
little
imp.
And
I
love
you,
Leviticus.

-
Please,
no!
Would
you
prefer
a
seat,
Leviticus?
I'll
sleep
in
my
grave,
Sophistication.
While
alive,
I
prefer
dancing.
Sassanian.
Who's
your
new
friend?
-
There's
your
new
friend.
AT
TALUS:
A
toast!
I
drink
to
our
Greek
friends
...Macedonia
and
Greece,

And
to
Philip,
our
king,
without
whom
Come,
At
talus,
leave
some

And
last,
I
drink
to
the
king's
marriage
...a
Macedonian
queen

To
Philip
and
Eurydice...
...and
to
their
legitimate
sons!

Alexander,
don't!
What
am
I,
you
son
of
a
dog?

-
Shut
up.
Shut
up,
all
of
you!
This
is
my
wedding,
Insolent
pup.
Apologize,
by
Zeus,
You
defend
the
man
who
called
-
And
I
dishonor
you?
At
talus
is
my
family
now,
Then
choose
your
relatives
Don't
expect
me
to
sit
here
-
You
insult
me!
A
man
not
fit
to
lick
the
ground
-
You
dog,
questioning
your
queen.
I've
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of,
I'll
marry
the
girl
if
I
want,
There's
nothing

Why,
drunken
man,
must
you
think...
...everything
I
do
and
say
Because
I
know
her
heart,
by
Hera...
...and
I
see
her
in
your
eyes.
You
covet
this
throne
too
much.
Now,
we
all
know
that
she-wolf
Well,
you
can
both
dream,
boy.
Come,
Philip,
this
is
the
wine
talking.
NOW!
I
command
you.
Apologize
to
your
kinsman.
Apologize.
No
kinsman
to
me.
Good
night,
old
man.
And
when
my
mother
remarries,
You
bastard!
You'll
obey
me.
Come
here.

And
this
is
the
man
who
is
going
He
can't
even
make
it
Get
out
of
my
palace!
Banished
from
the
land.

no
son
of
mine!

delight


Truly,
Alexander
could
love
like
no
other.
But
to
betray
him
was
to
rouse
And
he
massacred
several
thousand
...and
sold
the
survivors
into
slavery.
This,
as
intended,
And
though,
in
the
end,
he
treated

You'll
stain

I've
always
believed,
Alexander.
But
this
seems
Did
Patrols
doubt
Achilles...
...when
they
stood
side
by
side
Patrols
died
first.
If
you
do...
If
you
were
to
fall,
Sophistication,
...I
will
avenge
you...
...and
follow
you
down
I
would
do
the
same.
On
the
eve
of

Yes.
Then
perhaps...
Perhaps
this
is
farewell...
...my
Alexander.
Fear
not,
Sophistication.
We

Come,

turn
right!
Phalanx,
attention!
Solemness.
I
remember
you
the
day
You
were
a
giant.

How
far
was
it
you
threw
your
man
Will
you
match
it
with
your
spear?


And
Timberland,
son
of
Menander,
I
still
mourn
your
brother,
Adagios,
What
an
honored
family
You
fight
for
them
today.
You've
all
honored
your
country
And
now
we
come
to
this
...where
across
from
us,
Darius

But
ask
yourselves,
who
is
this
great
king
...to
murder
my
father,
our
king...
...in
a
most
despicable
Who
is
this
great
king,
Darius,
Who
is
this
king
but
a
king
of
air?
These
men
do
not
fight
for
their
homes.
They
fight
because
this
king
And
when
they
fight,
...because
they
know
no
loyalty
But
we
are
not
here
today
as
slaves.
We
are
here
today...
...as
Macedonian
freemen!

Some
of
you...
...perhaps
myself...
...will
not
live
to
see
the
sun
set
But
I
say
to
you...
...what
every
warrior
has
known
Conquer
your
fear...
...and
I
promise
you,


When
they
ask
why
you
fought
"I
was
here
this
day
at
Gaugamela...
...for
the
freedom...
...and
glory...
...of

No,

GO!
We

the

Alexander!
They've
overrun

Alexander,
if

You

you'll
never

enough!

What
shall
I
call

you,

the

he
has
no
power,

As
long
as
he's
lost,

Only
when
he's
found
It
seems
you've
already
We
must
finish
what
we
failed
We
must
hunt
Darius
down.
-
That
was
not
your
father's
mission.

Come
on.
Fortune
favors
the
bold.
By
the
gods,
what
is
this?
No
wonder
Darius
fled
I
venture
one
for
every
night
NAPOLEONS:
How
will
I
go
back
to
Lachesis
I
advise
you
not
to
touch,

was
perhaps
prescient.

are
not
wrong,
Princess

He,
too,
is
Alexander.

Please.
I
plead
for
my
family's
lives.

Sell
me
as
a
slave,
great
king,
but--
...in
my
eyes...

...and
tell
me...

would
you
like
to
be
treated?
As
I
am...

so
be
it.

the
mercy
of

now
to

must
watch
him

certain
that

Ptolemy,
your

yes.

beware
of

They
blind
themselves.

I
leave
out.
But
all
of
them
you
make
rich...
...while
your
mother
and
yourself,
Why
won't
you
ever
believe
me?
It
is
only
a
dark
mind
like
mine
that
For
they
are
dark,
Alexander.
So
dark.
But
in
you...
...the
son
of
Zeus,
Your
companions
will
be
shadows
...when
you
are
a
name
living
forever
...shining
light
of

Never
will
there
be

the
Great.
Remember,
bring

I
can
only
help
you,
for
they
know
...they
will
face
my
wrath,
It's
a
high
ransom

charges
Bring
her,
Alexander.

It'll
give
her
such
joy.
When
I'm

cracked
mirror
Stay
with
me
tonight,
Sophistication.
I'll
take
my
own
bath.
Thank
you,
Bagoas.

The
generals
question
your
obsession

it
was
never
meant
Naturally.
They
want
only
to
return
to
their
homes,
I've
seen
it
now
1000
times,
These
people
want...
Need
change.
Aristotle
was
wrong
about
them.
How
so?
Look
at
those
we've
conquered.
They
leave
their
dead
unburied.
They
smash
their
enemies'
skulls
They
mate
in
public.
What
can
they
think
or
sing
or
write
But
as
Alexander's
army,
they
can
go
They
can
soldier
or
work
in
the
cities.

We
could
connect
these
lands,
...and
the
people.
Some
say
these

become
They
draw
people
into
the
cities
But
we
freed
them,
Sophistication,
from
To
free
the
people
of
the
world...
...such
would
be
beyond
the
glory
...a
feat
to
rival
Prometheus...

was
always
a
friend
to
man.
Remember
the
fates
of
these
heroes.
-
They
suffered
greatly.
Your
father,
mine.
They
all
came
to
the
end
of
their
time.
And
in
the
end,
when
it's
over,
You
once
said,
Are
there
no
other
forces?
Is
there
not
love
in
your
life...
...Alexander?
I
wonder
sometimes
if
it's
not
So
many
years,
What
is
it
you
fear?
Who
knows
these
things?
When
I
was
a
child,
my
mother
thought
Which
am
I,
Sophistication?
Weak
or
divine?
All
I
know
is...
...I
trust
only
you
in
this
world.
I've
missed
you.
I
need
you.
It
is
you
I
love,
Sophistication.
No
other.
You
still
hold
your
head
cocked.
-
Like
that.
No.
Like
a
deer,
listening
in
the
wind.
You
strike
me
still,
Alexander.
And
you
have
eyes
like
no
other.
I
sound
as
stupid
...you're
everything
I
care
for...
...and
by
the
sweet
breath
...I'm
so
jealous
of
losing
you
You'll
never
lose
me,

I'll
be
with
you
always.
Till
the
end.

ARMENIAN:
After
all
this
time,
ALEXANDER:
PHILOTAS:
Just
take
her
as
your
concubine.
Because
I
want
a
son.
Then
half
your
nobles
have
sisters
To
take
an
Asian
as
my
queen,
It
will
bring
us
together,
unify
us.
Which
is
not
to
say
I
won't
take

As
a
second
wife?
You
insult

This
is
about
the

Alexander?

what?
To

To

To

Look
what
you

you,

spread
our
flank
too
thin!

any
of
you
could've
done!
Alexander,
I've
known

at
your

death.
At
the

least,
for
Zeus'
sake...

was
in

No.
No,
no.




You
have
no

It's
fitting.

for
a

finds
her.
The
myth
becomes
real.



Great
man?
Sikander.
You,
I
kill
now.
Do
it.
End
it.
I
would
do--
I
would
do
the
same.
I'll
die
a
fool
for
this...

My
life
is
now
yours.
You
will
have
my

call
your
queen,

A

You,
with
your
breeding.
Already
she
makes

Do
not
confuse
us.
I
was
never
a
barbarian
as
Philip
said.
We
are
of
Achilles'
royal
blood.

is
your
father.

Oh,
I
understand
she
brings

hear
me
when
I
tell
you...
...act
and
act
soon.
After
seven
years,

wonder:
"Who
is
this
King
Alexander?"
I
have
given
you
ample
proof.

Return
to
Babylon
Or
come
home
to
Macedonia
But
do
not
chase

...further
east.
Your

mine
depend
on
it.
Remember...
...my
only
thoughts
are
of
you.
As

face
Think

Provide
for

Who
did
this?

Tell
me.
PHILOTAS:
Never
will
you
find
a
man
PTOLEMY:
...not
only
because
it
involved
...who'd
shared
his
dream...
...but,
more
intimately,
...his
companion
from
boyhood,
who
was
Alexander.
Remember
me
for
who
I
am.
I
do
remember
you,
Philosophy,
It
appears
to
me
and
your
peers
that
No.
PTOLEMY:
None
of
us
defended
Philosophy.
Then
again,
none
of
us
ever
liked
him.
And,
of
course,
his
power

Before
he
died,
we
tortured
him...
...to
find
out
what
his
father,
But
this
we
never
learned.
What
to
do
with

a
far
more
delicate
matter.
Was
he
innocent
in
this,

the
end
of
the
world.
In
the
spring,
Alexander
marched
...across
the
passes
...into
the
unknown.
In
his
dream,
it
was
the
promised
route
We
were
now
a
mobile
empire...
...stretching
back
thousands
of
miles
Cooks
and
architects,
...moneylenders
and
wives...
.
.
.
children,
lovers,
whores.
And
forget
not
the
slaves...
...that
anonymous,
bent,
working
spine
Ravaged
or
expanded,
...no
occupied
territory
Although
devoted
to
Roxanne...
...Alexander's
visits
...as
a
year,
then
two,
went
by
...wounding
Alexander's
great
pride.
The
surveyors
are
saying
that
Zeus
In
one
of
those
caves.
They
say
there's
a
giant
eagle's
nest
I
suppose
he
drops
down
each
night
ALEXANDER:
You
remember
what
Yes,
I
do.
That
when
we
reach
these
heights...
...we'd
look
back
and
see
Macedonia
...and
the
outer
ocean
to
the
east.

But
I
fear
this
world
is
far
larger
A
world
of
Titans.
The
scouts
have
been
up
There
is
no
way
across.
Except
to
the
south,
into
India.
Were
we
gods,
we'd
breach
We
will,
Alexander.
In
a
few
years'
time,
we
will
return.
But
first,
the
men
Have
you
found
your
home...
...Ptolemy?
More
and
more,
I
think
Well,
at
least
it's
hot.
And
Thais...
...she
loved
it
there.
Women
bring
men
home.
-
I
have
no
such
feeling.
Where
your
mother
Yes,
I
have
Babylon.
But
each
land,
each
boundary
I
cross...
...I
strip
away
another
illusion.
I
sense
death
will
be
the
last.
Yet
still
I
push
harder
and
harder...
...to
reach
this
home.
Where
has
our
eagle
gone?
We
must
go
on,
Ptolemy.
Until
we
find
an
end.

PTOLEMY:
...fabled
to
be
even
richer
...had
never
been
explored
From
the
beginning,
Alexander
struggled
Kings
who
conspired
A
labyrinth
of
tribes
urged
on
...to
die
by
the
thousands
Crater's,
in
the
advance
party,
...who
were
tiny
and
lived


Until
Sophistication
convinced
us
...who
imitated
men
CRATERS:
They
called
this
tribe
"monkey."
MAN:
-
Incredible.
Look,
Roxanne.
Hello,
little
man.
ALEXANDER:
Do
they
speak?
And
then,
there
was
the
rain.
Never
before
had
we
seen
water
...for
60
days
and
nights.
ALEXANDER:
What's
your
son
going
to
say?
Come
on,
man.
MACHATAS:
Give
me
my
horse,
Alexander.
I'll
be
with
you
at
your
side.

MAN:
Hold
it,
hold
it
tight.
Leviticus,
bring
the
snake
healers!
-
Pauvanus.
Someone
bring
Pauvanus.
-
What
happened,
lad?
Oh,
no.
Zeus,
no.
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
Be
brave.
Be
brave.
Oh,
Zeus.
PTOLEMY:
As
we
realized
Tempers
worsened.
We
massacred
all
Indians
And
with
the
local
water
putrid...
...we
drank
the
strong
wine.


As
we
moved
southeast...
...Alexander
often
returned
the
lands
...so
as
to
make
of
them
allies.
But
this
did
not
sit
well
...who
began
to
wonder
if
Alexander
...to
imitate
the
glory
of
Herakles.

ALEXANDER:
To
Bagoas.
-
And
to
my
mother's
god,
Dionysus...
...who,
we're
told
by
our
Indian
allies,
...some
6000
years
ago.
To
a
hero.
To
a
hero!
Roxanne.
You
lose
face.
These
Indians...
...they
are
a
low,
evil
people.
You
don't
try
to
understand
them.
I
try.
But
this
I
know,
Alexander.
In
Persia,
you
are
a
great
king.
Here...
...they
hate
you.
Let
us
go
back
to
Babylon.
There,
you
are
strong.
We'll
talk
about
this
later.
Yes.
Later.
Talk.
I
shall
come.
Tonight.
And
I
shall
wait.
Good
night,
my
king.
Your
Majesty.
I'll
toast
to
Bagoas.
And
the
30,000
beautiful
...we're
training
to
fight
And
to
the
memory
of
Philip.
Had
he
lived
to
see
...transformed
into
such...
...a
pretty
am“!-
To
Philip.
To
a
real
hero.
Philip!
And
to
Leviticus
and
his
new
appointment
Leviticus.
That's
a
fancy
way
But
we
all
know
what
a
pension
...after
30
years'
service.
You
call
governing
Has
Your
Majesty
given
any
...a
province
so
far
from
home?
Then
you
won't
make
a
very

So
be
it.
Let
me
rot
in
Macedonian
rags...
...rather
than
shine...
...in
Eastern
pomp.
I
won't
quake
and
bow
down
like
Sophistication,
Aristarchus,
Pericardia.
As
governor
of
one
...Leviticus,
does
it
not
occur
to
you
...bow
down
before
me,
Do
I
insist
on
Greeks
doing
the
same?
You
accept
Greek
offerings
Only
when
offered.
Then
why
don't
you
refuse
What
freedom
is
this,
You
bow
before
Herakles,
do
you
not,
...but
a
son
of
Zeus.
How
can
you,
so
young,
Why
not?
I've
achieved
more
in
my
years.
Traveled
as
far.
Probably
farther.
CLEITUS:
Did
you
conquer
Asia
I
mean,
who
planned
Was
it
not
your
father?
Or
is
his
blood
-
Zeus-Amon,
is
it?
You
mock
my
family.
Be
careful.
Never
would
your
father
have
taken
...asked
us
to
fight
with
them
Are
we
not
good
enough
any
longer?
I
remember
a
time...
...when
we
could
talk
as
men,
None
of
this
scraping,
groveling.
Now
you
kiss
them?
Take
a
barbarian,
childless
wife
Go
quickly,
Leviticus,
Doesn't
your
great
pride
This
army...
Without
it,
you're
nothing!
You
no
longer
serve
the
purpose
-
Get
him
from
my
sight!
What
was
I
serving
when
I
saved
Do
you
think
we'd
be
forced
now
Alexander!
Turn
out
the
guards!
-
Who's
with
him?
Who's
with
him?
I
call
Father
Zeus
to
witness.
I
call
you
to
trial
before
him!
And
we'll
see
how
deep
-
Take
him!
What
about
poor
Armenian?
You
made
me
do
your
foul
deed.
Hypocrite.
Despot.
False
king.
You
and
your
barbarian
mother



Leviticus.
Oh,
my
Leviticus.

-
Let
me
pass.
I
am
the
queen.

I
want
to
see
him.
He
says
none,
not
even
you.
-
He
needs
me.
And
he
needs
you?
Sophistication,
you
make
a
mistake.
The
army
needs
your
reassurance.
Alexander.
Yes.
Like
an
old
lover
they
forgive,
You
know
more
than
any...
...great
deeds
are
done
by
men
You're
Alexander.
Pity
and
grief
will
only
destroy
you.
Have
I
become
so
arrogant
Sometimes...
...to
expect
the
best
of
everyone...
...is
arrogance.

Then
Leviticus
spoke
true.
I
am
become
a
tyrant.
SOPHISTICATION:
And
they
know
it.
And
they
forgive
you
because
I've
failed...
...utterly.

Philip,
King
of
Macedonia...
...and
leader
of
the
Greeks.
All
my
life,
I've
waited
to
see
Greeks
Today
is
that
day.
They
say
already,
...but
Alexander
is
simply
great."
But
if
you
ever
insult
me
again...
...I'll
kill
you.
I've
missed
you.
In
the
spring,
Persia.
You'll
command
my
horse
I'm
honored,
Father.
I
wouldn't
miss
it
Which,
one
day,
you'll
have.

OLYMPIAS:
He's
drunk
so
much
wine,
He's
lost
his
mind.
-
Your
Majesty.

I
hope
the
prince
...as
much
as
our
regent.
He's
very
tired.

Hey-
-
Sassanian,
bring
the
rest
of
the
guard.
To
the
arena!
March!
No
guard,
Your
Majesty?
-
Greeks
all
over
the
place.
My
Leviticus.
This
man
you
can
Treat
him
as
you
would
me.
He'll
guard
your
back
for
you.
Yes,
Father.
My
people
are
guard
enough
today.
Let
these
Greeks
see
for
themselves
Then
let
them
call
me
tyrant.
Bring
the
main
guard
in
Leviticus,
make
sure
the
wine
I
want
them
to
like
me.
Weren't
you
told?
I
go
in
alone.
Follow
with
the
main
guard.
Go
on.
-
Go
on.
You
want
the
world
to
see
Is
that
what
she
wants?
Don't
look
so
hurt
all
the
time,
You
count
yourself
lucky
you
were
here
By
Herakles,
by
Zeus,
...obey
me
this
once!
Have
courage,
Father.
And
go
on
your
way
...you
may
recall
your
valor.

HERALD:

whose
honor
Sassanian,
I
told
you--




MAN:

The

lives!
Alexander,
son
of
Philip!
May
the
gods
bless
the
king!
SOPHISTICATION:
May
the
gods
bless
Alexander!
-
Alexander!
Get
out.
Go.
How
can
you
behave
Because
it
was
meant
to
be.
This
isn't
how
I
wanted
-
No
one
blames
you.
-
In
secret.
Shame
is?
Tell
me.
Tell
me,
or
shall
I
put
you
on
trial
-
Sassanian.
Did
you
help
him?
No,
never.
Why?
Why
would
I?
So
many
wanted
it.
Greeks,
Persians,
men--
You're
mad.
You're
cursed.
You've
unleashed
Furies,
Oh,
now
who
is
exaggerating?
Even
if
it
was
the
wish
of
your
heart--
That's
a
lie!
He
was
my
father!
He
was
not
your
father!
You
owe
no
blood
debt
to
that
man.
You
lie
and
lie
and
lie.
So
many
lies
you've
spun
Look
at
you.
Look
at
you.
You
are
everything
that
he
was
not.
He
was
coarse,
you
are
refined.
He
was
a
general,
and
you
are
a
king.
He
could
not
rule
himself...
...and
you
shall
rule
the
world.
You're
so
cursed
by
all
the
gods
Such
thick
pride...
...and
no
mourning
for
your
husband.
Mourn...
...him?
What
do
you
know
of
Philip?
No,
Alexander.
Zeus
is
your
father.
-
Act
like
it.
You
murdered
me
in
my
cradle.
You
birthed
me
in
a
sack
of
hate.
Hate
you
have
for
those
-
Hate
you
have
for
men.
And
by
Zeus
and
Dionysus,
Damn
your
sorceress
soul.
Your
soul
is
mine,
Alexander.
No!
No!
You've
taken
from
me
everything
Stop
it.
Stop
acting
like
a
boy.
You're
a
king.
Act
like
one.
Armenian
is
with
us,
for
once.
Execute
At
talus
without
delay.
Then
confiscate
their
lands
and
root
out
Eurydice?
Never.
Laugh,
you
monster.
You
heartbreaker.
How
will
you
-
Have
you
learned
nothing
from
Philip?
The
best.
What
have
I
done
One
day,
you
will
understand
this.
But
I
have
only
you
in
my
heart.
I
know
what
you
need.
Now
is
the
time.
The
gods
favor
you.
Great
wealth,
power,
conquest.
All
you
desire.
The
world
is
yours!
Take
it.
Take
it.

home

there
is
no

was
the
worst
blunder
of
his

And
when
he

reentered
Babylon,

again
seized

He
mixed
it
with

scimitar.
You
were
the
only
one
The
only
one
who's
ever
been
You
saved
me
from
myself.
Please
don't
leave
me,
Sophistication.
My
Alexander.
I
remember
the
young
man
who
wanted
And
you,
Patrols.
Ours
is
a
myth
only
young
men
believe.
-
But
how
beautiful
a
myth
it
was.
Oh,
Sophistication.
-
I
worry
for
you
without
me.
Come,
fight,
Sophistication.
We
will
die
together.
It's
our
destiny.
We'll
have
children
with
our
wives...
...and
our
sons
will
play
together
A
thousand
ships
We'll
round
Arabia
From
there,
we'll
build
a
channel
through
And
then
we'll
move
on
Carthage.
And
that
great
island,
Sicily,
After
that,
the
Roman
tribe,
And
then
explore
...and
out
the
Pillars
of
Herakles
And
then
one
day,
...Babylon,
with
its
deep-water
harbor,
Alexandria
will
grow,
Asia
and
Europe
will
come
together.
And
we'll
grow
old,
Sophistication...
...looking
out
our
balcony
Sophistication?
Sophistication?

-
Where
is
this
doctor?
-It's
not
possible.
I
swear
by
Apollo.
Take
him
out
now
and
execute
him.
-
Come
away,
come
away.
Get
out.
Get
out
now!
Be
gone.
Be
gone
with
you.
Are
you
drunk
again?
-
Get
out.
-
Who?
...but
I
don't
think
any
other
Sophistication
is
dead?
Are
you
mad?
You
monster.
-
Are
you
mad?
May
all
the
Furies
through
time
Alexander.
-
Alexander,
we
have
a
son.
-
The
child.
Alexander,
I
have
your
child.
We
have
a
son.
My
poor,
poor,
ill-fated
son.
Never
touch
me
again.
No!

ALEXANDER:
Before
the
dawn.
To
my
old
friends.

-
And
to
the
myths.
MAN
1:
Drink
it
down.
MAN
2:

To
the
next
dawn.

ALEXANDER:
Come
to
Babylon.
I
await
you.
Wait.
Wait.
Vultures.
Wait.
Your
son,
Alexander.
Just
three
more
months.
Please
live.
Alexander.
Alexander,
we
beg
you.
Tell
us
who.
Who
will
rule
this
great
empire
ALEXANDER:
We're
at
the
beginning.
The
myth
becomes
real.
Beyond
Herakles.
ALEXANDER:
When
it's
over,
OLYMPIAS:
ARISTARCHUS:
Satrapies
will
revolt.
PTOLEMY:
Pray
tell
us,
who?
-
What
did
he
say?
-
He
said,
"To
the
best."
-
No,
he
said,
"To
Crater's."
MAN
3:

PTOLEMY".
...a
month
short
of
his
33rd
year...
...Alexander's
great
heart
And
as
he
vowed,
But
in
his
short
life,
...the
mythic
glory
His
sacrifice
was
an
early
death...
...but
in
keeping
...I
cannot
help
but
feel
Olympias'
transgression
...is,
to
my
mind,
a
probability.
His,
a
burden.
Alexander
was
too
in
love
with
glory
But
by
blood,
and
blood
alone,
No!
-
The
body
stays
in
Babylon.
...we
were
fighting
like
jackals
The
wars
of
the
world
had
begun.
Forty
years,
off
and
on,
they
endured.
Cassandra
in
Greece.
Solucas
and
Pericardia
in
the
East.
-
Until
we
divided
his
empire
in
four
parts.
Cassandra
certainly
proved
...when
seven
years
later,
And
within
12
years,
he
achieved...
...the
complete
destruction
...when
he
poisoned
Roxanne...
...and
Alexander's
13-year-old
son,
But
the
truth
is
never
simple...
...and
yet
it
is.
The
truth
is,
We
did
kill
him.
By
silence,
we
consented.
Because--
Because
we
couldn't
go
on.
What,
by
Ares,
...but
to
be
discarded
in
the
end,
After
all
this
time,
...to
Asian
sycophants
we
despised?
Mixing
the
races,
harmony?
Pah.
Oh,
he
talked
of
these
things...
...but
wasn't
it
really
about
Alexander...
...and
another
population
I
never
believed
in
his
dream.
None
of
us
did.
That's
the
truth
of
his
life.
The
dreamers
exhaust
us.
They
must
die
before
they
kill
us
Oh,
just
throw
all
that
away,
Cad
mos.
It's
an
old
fool's
rubbish.
You
shall
write,
"He
died
of
fever
Yes,
great
Pharaoh.
Oh,
he
could've
stayed
home
He'd
have
died
a
celebrated
man.
But
this
was
not
Alexander.
All
his
life,
And
by
this,
and
this
alone,
The
freest
man
I've
ever
known.
His
tragedy
was
one
...and
impatience
with
those
And
if
his
desire...
...to
reconcile
Greek
and
barbarian
What
failure!
His
failure
towered
I've
lived--
I've
lived
long
life,
Cad
mos...
...but
the
glory
...will
always
belong
to
the
ones
And
the
greatest
of
these
...Megas
Alexandros.
The
greatest
Alexander
of
them
all.
