Will?
WILL:
Come
out
here.
Listen.
Your
ears
are
better
than
mine.
Somebody's
coming.
I
don't
hear
nothing.
Turn
off
that
whatchama-call-it.
-
The
radio.

First,
I
heard
one
of
them
cars.
And
now
You
hear?
MAN:
Y'all
stay
right
here.
Pa,
that
ain't
no
way
to
welcome
folks.
Kin
don't
come
in
no
cars.
See
if
you
can
wake
up
Hey,
Blue?
Come
on,
Blue.
Come
on,
Blue.
Never
seen
such
a
crickety
dang
pit
Stuck
up
all
over
here
and
everything.

-
Are
you
Will
Stockdale?
Three
dang
times
this
month,
Don't
you
point
your
finger
Are
you
threatening
me
with
a
firearm?
I'm
a
government
representative
Busting
up
here
-
What
government?
This
boy's
been
called
for
the
draft.
He's
a
draft
dodger.
Fold
in
that
finger,
sir.
He
could
go
to
jail
for
that.
And
this
is
your
last
chance.
If
you
don't
leave
with
that
group
...you're
gonna
be
in
more
trouble
You
already
got
one
offense
against
you.
-
Not
answering
my
letters.
Don't
tell
me
you
can't
read.
You
could've
-
So
that
ain't
no
excuse.
...and
tell
me
to
my
face
-
Now,
look...
...who
has
gone
to
school...
...and
who
has
read
more
times
...couldn't
read
a
puny
little
old
letter,
By
dog,
sir.
I
never
got
no
letters.
I
don't
think
I
can
stand
Get
that
book.
No,
sir,
what
you
think
...but
we
are
gonna
settle
this
here
question
...and
not
have
Read
at
him.
"Once
there
was
a
boy
named
Tony...
...who
wanted
a
pony.
So
he
went
to
his
mama
and
said:
'May
I
have
a
pony?
'
And
his
Mama
says:
'No,
Tony,
you
may
not
have
a
pony."'
Go
on.
"So
he
went
to
his
papa
and
said:
'Papa,
may
I
have
a
pony?
'
And
his
papa
says:
'No,
Tony,
you
may
not
have...
...a
pony."'
End
of
the
book,
Now
that
we
have
settled
-
Pa.
...and
back
in
that
car
of
yours
-
Pa,
be
Christian
to
him.
You
know
...if
a
man
come
all
hot
...without
saying
howdy
or
nothing?
Scaring
his
chickens
Sir,
would
it
be
all
right
-
Okay,
but
make
it
short.
Come
on,
Pa.
And
don't
try
any
funny
business.
Set
yourself,
Pa.
Now,
listen,
Pa.
I
don't
think
I
mean,
I'd
kind
of
like
to
go.
There's
a
whole
lot
of
fellas
there
You
listen
to
me,
boy.
Going
in
the
draft
It
means
Macon
and
Atlanta
I've
been
to
Atlanta,
you
know
that.
I
told
you
how
them
folks
laughed
at
me
You
don't
want
that,
boy.
-
Pa,
now
ain't
the
same
as
it
was
then.
But
they
want
me.
They
even
sent
a
fella
And
that
ain't
all.
Last
spring,
I
seen
a
sign
on
the
sidewalk
This
great
big
old
picture
of
Uncle
Sam.
"And
Uncle
Sam
wants
you,"
Just
like
this
fellow
here,
Pa,
Don't
you
think
a
soldier
fella
...inviting
me
to
come
along
I
told
him
how
you
was
ailing
then...
...and
would
he
kindly
wait
a
while.
You've
been
tearing
up
them
letters,
And
you
ain't
ailing
no
more.
-
Hey,
are
you
coming
or
do
I
have
to...
You've
got
to
know
this:
He's
a
good
boy.
It's
my
blame
I
don't
care
who
or
why,
mister.
Remember,
Pa?
Ain't
it
nice
I'm
finally
getting
a
chance
Appears
they
liked
to
have
shrunk
a
little.
They'll
put
shoes
on
you
in
Army.
And
ain't
gonna
wait
Listen,

them

Say
goodbye
to

I

Print

I
will.
Remember,
draft
man,

I
said.

IRVING:
"So
I

I
told
you
"lt'll
break
his
poor
heart
if
he's

will
be
proud
of

Irving,
you
ain't
sick
like
I
thought,
Listen,
Plowboy.
Yeah,
sure.
I
imagine
it's
time
for
us
So
I'd
thank
you
-
They're
beginning
to
chafe
me
a
mite.
Yeah.
Yeah,

All
right,
let's
stop
kidding
around
here.
Why,

Irving.
All

Move

So
long,

I
appreciate
if
you
write
me
how
much
Bye.

It
sure
was
interesting
They
took
us
around
And
they
stuck
needles
into
our
arms...
...
and
whomped
us
on
the
knees

and
mashed
down
our
tongues
Then
after
a
real
nice
supper...

Anything
else?
Sergeant,
I
feel
it's
my
duty
to
tell
you
Fella
named
Stockdale.
A
draft
dodger.
He
gave
me
a
lot
of
trouble.
Not
on
the
bed,
please.
I
was
put
in
charge
They
brought
him
to
the
bus
in
these.
I'll
make
a
note
of
it.
I
think
he'll
need
some
disciplinary
action.
He
already
hit
one
of
the
fellas
-
In
the
barracks
here?
I'll
make
a
note
of
it.
I
thought
he
ought
to
be
reported
-
Oh,
no.
Any
reporting
done
around
here,
I
do
it.
Sure
you
do.
And
this

About
six
hours,

It's

there

I'm
in
a

another,
You
know
what
you
do
if
you
report
...or
request
something?
You
make

No,
come
on,
Ben,
you
take
the

But,
honest,
I
like
sleeping

I
didn't
mean

by
it.
First
come,

-
No,
now
come
on,
Ben.
-
Now,
come
on.
I'm
beginning
to
think
I

Well,
Irving,
I
wasn't
doing
nothing.
Look,
if
you
want
some
fighting,
-
Not
some

Why
don't
you
mind
your
own
business?
We're
just
stopping
him
That's
between
him
and
me,
Now,
Ben,
don't...

Only

do
you
a

anything,

You

I

about

I
was
just
going
to,
Irving.
BRONCO:
Give
him
time,
Irving,
He's
used
to
sleeping
with
the
hogs.

-
What's
the
matter
with
you,
anyhow?
Taking
their
insults
They
don't
mean
nothing
by
it,
Ben.
Besides,
I
thought
that
one
about
sleeping
-
Aww...
Well,

me
try
to
explain.
Shut
up.
No,
I
am
not
in
the

I
am
quite
tired.
You
understand?
And
I
want
no
more
noise.
You

I
will
be
more
than
willing

along.
We
won't

for

Get

Ooh!
He
seems
a

upset.
Oh,

You
get
his
feet.
Let
him
alone,

He'll
wake
up
Yeah,
I
reckon
he
might.

Pretty
good
fight,
though,
wasn't
it?

What
will,
Ben?
But

said
Not

it,
I'll
never

kept
our
mouths
shut
and
didn't
Both
of
us?
But
now,
No,
they
won't.
If
one
of
them
says
anything,
I'll
take
him
Now,
there
you
go,
Will.
You
think
No,
they
want
men
who
can
take
it
...the
way
a
man
ought
to
do.
Transfer?
We'll
be
lucky
Walking
around
Do
you
really
want
both
of
us

All
the
rest
is

Hey,
Ben.
Hey.
Hey,
Ben.




All
right,
I'm
up,
I'm
up.
All
right,
I'm
up.
Howdy,
I'm
Will
Stockdale.
I
didn't
hear
the
whistle.
If
the
captain
comes
around,
I'll
be
out
there
just
as
quick
as
I
can...
It's
12:00
at
night.
It
is?
Oh...
That's
a
prettiest
watch.
You
woke
me.
Well,
you
said
to
knock
before
entering.
Why
did
you
wake
me?
This
ain't
nothing
personal
...no,
that
we
don't
like
your
barracks
What
it
is,
is
Ben's
got
these
six
brothers
That's
my
new
buddy
Ben,
So
naturally,
I
mean,
with
the
infantry
doing
the
real
Well,
you
know,
So
he
wants
to
transfer
and
he
wants
me
I
figured
you
could
do
it
for
us.
Heh-heh.
I
heard
what
you
said
out
there...
...about
how
you
was
here
to
help
us
Why
do
they
send
all
the
bums
-
They
do?
Yes,
they
do.
Sure
must
be
a
mess.
-
Whatever
your
name
is,
get
out...
Stockdale,
I
want
you
to
get
out
of
this...
Don't
you
come
near
me.
Get
out
of
this
room
and
get
back
Yes,
sir.
Ben
did
say
-
Stockdale,
where
you
going?
Oh,
no.
But
Ben,
he
knows
all
Oh,
no.
You
can't,
you
can't.
You
just:
Oh,
you
can't
do
it.
Captain
would
just
as
soon
-
Well,
I
ain't
got
no
stripes.
Now,
you'll
never
get
transfers
He
won't
understand.
-
Well,
I'll
go
over
it
real
slow.
Now,
if
you
want
the
captain
...you've
gotta
do
a
favor
Yeah,
that's
it.
Now,
how
would
you
like
to
do
-
Me?
Come
on.
You
do
one
for
him,
That's
the
way
it
works
out
in
the
service.
Now
do
you
know
what
this
is?
It's
a
kind
of
a
big
outhouse,
ain't
it?
-
We
call
it
the
latrine.
-
Uh-huh.
You
might
say
it's
the
captain's
hobby,
And
when
it
sparkles,
Now,
you
get
it
all
cleaned
up.
You
are
the
officer
in
charge.
In
charge?
Every
last
one
of
them,
all
yours.
Golly.
Now,
you
just
stay
right
here
-
You
bet.
Good
night.
Hey,
thank
you.
Well,
it
just
goes
to
show
you...
...how
good
things
happen
to
you
Well,
get
started.
WILL:
I
stayed
officer
in
charge
Rubbing
and
scrubbing...
...
and
doing
my
best
to
make
things
sparkle
And
then
I
stayed
on
...
because
I
wanted
to
do
So
Sergeant
King
would
be
real
pleased
...
when
he
come
in
Beautiful.
Beautiful,
beautiful,
beautiful.
-
Beautiful.
Wait'll
the
captain
sees
this.
He
inspects
this
...where
somebody
Never
in
your
life
you've
seen
such
a
guy
-
You
figure
he'll
like
what
I
done?
Will,
how
would
you
like
-
Permanent
latrine
orderly?
Golly.
The
captain
makes
inspection
Now,
if
you
could
keep
everything
...the
captain'll
get
off
my
back.
Gee,
I'd
sure
like
to,
sergeant...
...but
I
was
kind
of
set
on
helping
Ben
You
know,
he's
my
buddy.
Ain't
I
your
buddy?
You
are.
You
help
me
out,
I'll
help
Ben.
Just
don't
say
anything
about
this
I'm
going
to
the
record
section
and
fix
it
up
Okay.
Sergeant,
don't
I
have
to
take
them
tests
...and
get
myself
classified?
No,
Will,
you've
been
classified.

If
we
hurry,
we
can
catch
that
picture
Not
me,
Ben.
-
You
said
you
ain't
never
seen
a
picture.
-
You're
going
back
to
that
latrine
again?
It's
against
the
rules
for
you
All
week
you've
been
there.
Sergeant
King
knows
the
rules,
don't
he?
Besides,
like
I
told
you,
-
What
favor,
will
you
tell
me
that?
You
don't
go
to
lectures
or
study,
Sergeant
King
says
I'm
already
that
way.
-
Are
you
crazy?
Don't
you...?
Just
wait
and
see
what
the
captain
says
Why
you
take
them
faucets,
for
instance.
I
polished
them
so
hard,
What?
At
ease.
I
think
you'll
be
very
pleased
here,
sir.
Attention.
Latrine
ready
for
inspection,
sir.
This
is
incredible.
I
am
pleased.
No.
-
No,
I
am
happy.
-
You
the
one
on
latrine
duty
today,
private?
-
Ahem,
ahem.
Just
look
at...
What
did
you
say?
Me?
Nothing,
sir.
-
Something
about
all
week.
Well,
I
done
my
best
in
one
day,
...it
took
me
a
week
Is
this
man
being
punished
-
Oh,
no,
sir.
No,
sir.
-
You're
what?
Stockdale.
Oh,
but
don't
credit
me
none
though,
sir.
He
even
got
it
fixed
up
-
Sir,
I...
Oh,
no,
sir.
Yes,
sir.
...telling
me
how
latrines
...and
sticking
your
head
-
Sir,
I
can
explain
every...
Sir,
I
been
wanting
to
tell
you
Oh,
he
solves
our
problems
for
us...
...and
helps
us
out
on
our
difficult
days
And
I
guess
that
he's
...in
the
whole
danged
Air
Force.
Sir,
you
really
ought
to
get
up
How
long
have
you
been
a
sergeant?
-
Well,
sir,
I...
Ahem.
Sixteen
years,
sir.
And
how
long
do
you
expect
Twelve
years.
You
will
remain
a
sergeant
Unless
this
man
completes
...and
is
shipped
out
with
the
group
Unless
this
man
is
out
of
here
...you
will
not
be
in
charge
of
this
barracks,
...you
will
in
all
probability
PLO.
This
is
not
your
fault,
private.
You've
done
a
fine
job.
I
have
never
seen
such
a
clean
latrine
Thank
you,
sir.
It
was
my
aim
to
get
it
just
as
clean
...where
they're
fixing
You
forgot
to
ask
him
What
happened?
What
did
you
do
it
for?
Heck,
I
couldn't
see
no
sense
We've
gotta
get
you
classified
right
away.
You
don't
want
me
around
no
more?
It
ain't
what
I
want,
Now,
we
gotta
get
you
classified
You're
gonna
have
to
take
tests
and
you're
And
you're
going
to
have
to
work
Will
it
help
Ben
and
me
Well,
I
guarantee
you,
wherever
you
go,
Well,
I'll
work
hard
all
right,
The
last
test
I
took
...and
that
was
one
of
them
tests...
...where
you
try
this
fella's
toothpaste
...and
see
if
your
teeth
don't
get
brighter.
And
I
failed.
You
been
admiring
this
watch
of
mine,
I
sure
have,
sergeant.
You
get
shipped
out
of
here
...and
it's
yours.
-
Mine?
Golly.
-
Now
you'll
work
real
hard,
right?
-
And
not
waste
any
time?
Good
boy.
Now
first
thing
Monday
morning,
You
stay
right
here
around
the
barracks
...and
relax
your
head.
I'm
going
down
to
the
testing
area
Okay.
Tell
them
I'll
give
them
back
WILL:
This
place
where
they
give
us
They
had
this
great
big
building,
All
of
them
walking
in
and
out
...
and
not
smiling
at
nobody.
And
then
there
was
this
place
...
where
they
give
us
Time's
up,
pal.
It
was
right
friendly
of
you
Thank
you.
-
How'd
you
think
you
did,
Will?
...they
was
exactly
like
the
ones
Only
what?
Only
you
spent
so
much
time
...we
ought
to
have
spent
a
little
more
Now,
you
just
sit
right
down
here
Come
on,
Will,
the
corporal's
waiting.
Here
he
is,
corporal.
What
we
do
here,
private,
...on
a
time
scale
Two
irregular
steel
links
I
separate
them,
I
join
them.
It
will
be
your
task,
...to
place
the
two
links
...I
have
just
demonstrated.
Uh...
I
put
them
together?
That's
right,
you
put
them
together.
I'll
time
you
Now,
whatever
you
do,
Ready.
Go.
There
you
go.
Attaboy.
-
Put
them
together.
Nobody
ever
does
this
You're
not
even
supposed
to
be
in
here.
This
is
a
special
case.
He
has
to
go
out
-
It's
is
a
very
difficult
test.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
I'd
just
like
to
see
you
try
to
do
it.
-
He's
my
department.
-
Get
out
right
this
minute.
You're
not
supposed
to
be
here.
-
All
right,
then
watch
your
watch...
Stop
the
watch.
-
Look.
Look
at
that.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
What's
the
fuss
about?
You
said,
Look
what
he
did,
for
Pete's
sake.
You're
supposed
to
be
grading
him
on
this.
I'm
supposed
to
mark
it
down
...and
there
ain't
supposed
to
be
How
you
gonna
mark
him
Who
do
you
think's
gonna
pay
for
these?
-
lf
you
think
I'm
gonna
pay
$
16...
Sixteen
lousy
dollars!
Corporal,
I'll
be
glad
to
pay
-
You
will?
He
did
it
wrong.
Will,
will
you
step
outside
Now,
corporal,
You
need
money
But
he
did
do
it
completely
wrong.
-
Ben?

I
ain't
seen
you
all
day.
-
Yeah.
Sergeant
King
says
That's
where
I'm
going
too
-
How
about
that?
Oh,
Ben,
you
ain't
still
sad
The
captain
didn't
even
read
my
letter.
And
that
plan
of
yours
I
tried
to
ask
the
psychiatrist
-
Yeah,
what'd
he
say?
I
don't
think
he
understands
so
good.
I'm
just
stuck
in
the
Air
Force,
that's
all.
Hey,
Ben,
maybe
it's
the
Air
Force
...and
the
infantry's
just
the
helpers.
Never.
Well,
Ben,
all
you
can
do
No.
Wait'll
my
brothers
find
out.
Airman.
Private.
What
kind
of
rowdydow
is
this?
Yes,
sir.
-
Is
that
a
way
to
treat
government
property?
We're
excited
because
we're
That's
no
excuse
for...
What's
the
matter
with
this
one?
-
Have
you
been
drinking?
Get
at
attention,
Will.
We're
sending
this
to
school?
Yes,
sir,
ma'am.
If
he
passes
the
eye
test,
As
what?
A
target?
No,
sir,
ma'am.
Let's
have
no
more
rowdydow,
understand?
Yes,
sir.
Ma'am.
What's
the
matter
with
you,
anyhow?
Don't
you
know
enough
-
She
was
a
woman.
Ain't
you
ever
heard
You
mean
they
got
one
too?
Sure.
-
Against
ours?
They're
with
us
100
percent.
-
We
got
to
salute
them?
Didn't
you
hear
that
lecture
I'll
be
dogged.
She
ain't
a
woman,
she's
a
captain.
I
seen
a
captain
there
A
captain,
that's
all.
-
A
woman
captain.
By
dog,
When
you're
in
uniform,
...whether
a
person
is
a
man
or
a
woman
A
captain's
a
captain,
a
major's
a
major
Ben,
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
A
captain,
that's
all
I
seen.
Well,
dog
it,
Ben,
Honest,
Will,
sometimes
I
wonder
Come
on,
Will.
You
too,
Whitledge.
Well,
Will,
it
looks
like
you're
just
liable
Just
shows
you
-
This
the
fella
you
want?
Whitledge?
Psychiatrist
says
...with
inferiority
I
ain't
surprised.
Recommends
he
be
considered
The
infantry?
Don't
get
excited.
Well,
yeah,
but
that's
what
-
Just
you
tell
me
what
I
have
to
do.
When
he's
finished,
buck
it
through
If
he's
crazy
enough
to
want
it.
How
about
that,
Ben?
You
made
it.
Just
wait'll
my
brothers
hear
about
this.
-
Stockdale?
Okay,
psychiatrist.
Oh,
Lord,
psychiatrist.
Now,
Will,
listen
carefully.
The
psychiatrist
test
is
one
...because
there
ain't
any.
The
doctor
asks
you
-
So
keep
your
wits
about
you.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey,
maybe
he'll
give
me
He'll
ask
you
things
like
Okay.
Hey,
maybe
he'll
give
me
a
transfer
too,
Sure,
Will.
-
The
psychiatrist
is
waiting,
Stockdale.
Wait
a
minute.
The
safest
thing
I
guess
is
-
Okay.
See
you
later,
Ben.
Sergeant?
Do
you
think
he
can?
Can
what?
Get
transferred
too.
Now,
don't
you
complicate
things.
I
never
have
no
dreams
at
all.
-
Where
are
you
from,
Stockdale?
That's
not
much
of
a
state,
is
it?
Well,
I
don't
live
all
over
the
state.
I
just
live
in
this
one
little
place
in
it.
That's
where
Tobacco
Road
is.
Georgia.
Not
around
my
section.
Maybe
you're
from
a
different
part

I've
never
been
there.
What's
more,
What's
your
reaction
to
that?
Well,
I
don't
know...
I
would
rather
live
in
the
rottenest
pigsty
...than
the
fanciest
mansion
How
about
that?
Well,
sir,
I
think
You
don't
mind
if
someone
says
I
ain't
heard
nobody
Well,
what
do
you
think
Well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
sir...
