when
have
you

Oh,
Hayes:
-

What?
-

Why
would

-Because

represents

from

one

must
have

why

that

means

to

I
asked

-
I
asked

live

think
it's

greatest
honor

know

just
so

could

You
gotta

might've

who've
They're
gonna
be
people
sitting
right
here
in

ofyou.
That's
who
you're
We
don't
have
anybody
That's
because
-
Okay.
So
what
happened?
That's
good.
This
doesn't
happen
in
a
vacuum.
Let's
get
a
complete
history
Talk
to
every
marine
My
guess
is
We
have
to
be
careful
here.
This
guy
is
A
Navy
Cross,
two
Silver
Stars
He
has
no
wife,
no
kids,
He
was
our
best.
He's
not
on
trial
for
the
but
for
what
he
did
Major,
nobody
wants
to
say
it,
but
it
occurs
to
me
we're
trying
So
let's
set
it
and
show
The
fil
rst
charge
supports
the
death
No
more
death.
I'll
see
that
he
never
gets
another
but
I
will
not
seek
death
for
a
man
Idon't
want
it
We
gotta
show
We
gotta
prove
he
went
out
and
that
is
not
going
to
be
easy.
Whether
a
man
is
charged
is
sometimes
a
very
thin
line.
Our
case
is
this:
Childers
receives
Iawful
protest
outside
He
is
to
secure
There
has
been
no
violence
Once
there,
Ambassador
Mourain...
does
not
feel
the
situation
-
Childers
ignores
him.
They
draw
fil
re
from
snipers
Childers
retaliates
into
an
unarmed
A
crowd
ofwomen
and
children.

Murder--
Obviously,
he

Not

You

been
Sometimes
you
just

I
saw

You
have
to
understand

kind
of
A
man
with
that
kind
ofservice--
This
was
a
rescue
mission
You're
aware,
Colonel,
You're
not
serious.
Oh,
I'm
very
serious.
What
do
you
think
would
happen
He'd
have
a
trial
and
they'd
take
off
his

Have

Please.
So
here
it
is:
He

himselfat

We'll
