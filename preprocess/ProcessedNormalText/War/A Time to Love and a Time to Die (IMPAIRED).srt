Ernst!
I
thought
it
was
you!
Don't
you
recognise
your
friend
anymore?
Binding.
Oskar
Binding,
of
course!
Who
else!
Where
have
you
come
from?
-
Russia.
I'd
say
that
calls
for
a
celebration.
I
have
a
first
rate
cognac
or
Come.
For
old
time's
sake.
-
I
could
use
a
drink.
You've
worked
your
way
up
in
the
world.
Just
goes
to
show
you
anything
can
happen.
Me,
who
couldn't
even
get
Political
leader
Come
on.
Cosy,
isn't
it.
And
all
mine,
a
milkman's
son!
Who
would
have
thought
that
I,
an
art
collector!
What
would
you
like
to
drink?
Brandy?
Cointreau?
Vodka?
Gin?
Kimmel?
Wine?
What?
Anything,
it
doesn't
matter.
What's
bothering
you,
Ernst?
If
there
is,
tell
me,
you
know

Maybe
you
can
help
me,
Oskar.
They
were
bombed
out,
I
can't
locate
them.
How
terrible.
I'll
see
what
I
can
find
out.
Nothing
else.
It's
as
good
as
done.
Come
on,
Take
off
your
coat.
-
Frau
Kleinert.
Brandy
glasses.
-
Where
are
you
living
now?
A
furlough
in
barracks?
-
Thanks,
but
I
can't.
Here
you
would
have
your
own
room
and
bath.
How
long's
it
been
since
you
had
real
Seems
like
I've
never
had
them.
Well
you
have
them
now.

Hertz.
-
Hobermeier.
Well,
how
do
you
like
it?
-
Immerman.
It'll
do!
-
Shroeder.
-
Here,
let
me
take
that.
-
Graeber.
Say!
You've
acquitted
yourself
well!
-
Heller.
-
Rainer.
They
hand
those
out
to
make
us
look
good.
That
how
you
got
that
little
ornament?
-
Holzmann.
-
Steinbrenner.
-
Russia?
-
Riess.
So
you
were
there
too?
Hahn.
Missing.
-
Herr
Binding?
31
present,
87
killed,
wounded
or
missing.
-
The
brandy
glasses.
-
Lieutenants
Kleiner
and
Haesser,
dead.
Combined
First
and
Second
Platoons,

present,
42

And
if
you
want
a
woman,
Ernst,
There's
a
chance
some
of
the
men
This
is
the
place
for
it.
Let's
hope
so.
They're
around
here
like
flies,
Get
your
men
into
some
kind
Offering
everything
they
have.
Sergeant
Muecke,
dismiss
the
battalion.
Even
if
they
no
longer
have
it.
You
should
have
seen

Battalion

A
beautiful
creature
with
long
red
hair
and
a
superb
figure.
Pleading
with
me
on
her
knees
to
get
her
husband
But
it
isn't
all
fun.
You've
no
idea
how
lonesome
it
gets
What's
the
name
of
this
village?
-
If
you
stay
here...
I
don't
know.
It
had
a
name
You
see,
everywhere
I've
been
It
even
had
people...
and
houses.
I've
given
the
barracks
as
my
address.
I
understand,
but
remember,
We've
been
through
here
so
often,
it's
And
if
you
need
anything,
The
first
time
we
were
coming
through
It
was
the
great
advance.
That's
very
good
of
you,
Oskar.
And
now
it's
the
great
retreat,
huh?
Not
at
all.
If
old
school
mates
What
I
mean
is...
Can
you
really
get
someone
out
In
retreat.
Don't
put
words
in
his
mouth,
Steinbrenner.
It's
easier
for
me
to
get
them
in
than
out.
But
naturally
I
didn't
tell
that
The
only
one
talking
about
retreat
You
remember
Professor
Pohlmann?
All
the
rest
of
us
know
Of
course.
We're
gonna
annihilate
Don't.
Remember,
he's
the
reason
We
annihilate
them
every
year,

of

more
important
than

might

a
pleasant
change.
Well,
when
I
became
Party
Adviser
to
Sergeant
Muecke
said
you're
to
quarter
I
had
him
put
in
a
camp!
Naturally
that
meant
that
he
was
Thanks
for
getting
Steinbrenner
He
had
me
kicked
out,
Watch
yourself,
the
Gestapo
didn't
That's
justice,
eh!
If
he
turns
you
in
as
an
alarmist
And
he's
still
in
the
camp?
No,
we
only
left
him
there
for
What
furlough?
I've
been
waiting
for
it
You
know
my
soft
heart.
Or
is
it
seven
years?
He
was
living
in
the
back
of
I
felt
so
sorry
for
him

Binding,
what
are
you
doing?
Sacrificing
my
favourite
bath
salts.
-
Hey,
Immerman.
Lilac.
The
perfect
finish
Finish
is
right.
Holy
jumping
Jupiter!
Looks
like
spring
is
coming.
That's
the
one
sure
way
to
tell.
To
your
parents...
and
our
friendship.
I'll
put
a
couple
of
men
on
it
What's
the
matter,
Hirschland?
In
a
few
days
we
ought
to
know
something.
Still
not
used
to
the
boulevards
of
Russia?
-
How
about
another
drink?
And
a
bottle
to
take
with
you.
Three
weeks
he's
been
with
us

Ha!
I
know.
Spring
at
home
means
That
comes
much
later
here.
First,
Leave
him
alone,
Sauer.
There
was
a
message
for
you,
I
tore
it
off.
This
isn't
to
be
used
to
make
dates.
It's
a
German
uniform.
Dig
him
out!
Here.
"Ernst,
if
you
want
to
see
me,
And
careful
with
the
shovels.
-
Oh,
he
won't
feel
it
anymore.
Elisabeth!
He
won't
feel
that
anymore
either.
Thanks.
Must
be
one
of
the
January
dead.
Remember
that
big
snow
storm?
Oh,
it's
you!
I
was
all
set
for
a
battle
Nah!
The
January
ones
melted
out
Ha
ha!
She's
gone
to
a
meeting
I
bet
you
this
is
one
of
the
November
dead.
Come
in.
-
January.
I'm
sorry
about
the
way
I
acted
last
night.
-
Oh,
don't...
I
have
such
a
terrible
temper.

He's
from
our
regiment.
Why
didn't
you
just
kick
me?
Get
Captain
Rahe.
I
would
have,
if
I
hadn't
of
thought
Careful
there,
it's
a
German
officer!
Even
that
he
won't
feel
anymore.
You're
early.
I
at
least
hoped
to
comb
my
hair
It's
Reike!
-
I
could
go
and
come
back
later?
Sit
down,
won't
you.
Did
you
learn
anything
about
No.
But
I
had
one
good
break.
He
looks
like
he's
crying.
Party
District
Leader,
no
less.
-
He
promised
to
do...
His
eyeballs
are
frozen.
He
was
a
class
mate
of
mine.
They're
thawing
now.
The
milkman
Binding's
boy.
He
offered
to
do
anything
he
could
What
was
I
supposed
to
say?
No?
It's
Lieutenant
Reike,
sir.
Not
only
that,
Elisabeth.
Bury
him
in
the
church
courtyard.
I
thought
if
I
handle
him
right
I...
Yes,
sir.
I
might
be
able
to
find
out
something
Send
his
personal
belongings
home.
That
should
be
easy
for
him.
All
he
has
to
do
is
ask
the
Gestapo.
Four
captured
guerrillas
Or
maybe
he's
one
of
them.
I'll
need
volunteers.
All
I
know
is
he's
the
person
I've
seen
Very
well,
sir.
Volunteers!
Step
forward.
Murderers
are
never
murderers


Some
adore
their
mothers,
But
it's
enough
when
they
are
murderers
I
volunteer,
sir.
At
least
for
the
people
who
are
Choose
the
others.
You're
in
command,
What
happened
to
you,
Ernst?
Or
don't
you
want
to
see?
All
right,
the
rest
It's
nearly
as
dangerous
to
talk
to
you
Immerman!
Sauer!
Hirschland!
Now,
this
came
from
Binding.
(Explosions
Or
shall
I
pour
it
down
the
sink?
We'll
drink
it.
I
must
have
a
corkscrew
some
place,
I'll
show
you
how
we
do
it
in
the
Army.
That's
one
way
to
avoid
a
hangover
I
guess!
Make
the
grave
bigger,
Grandpa,
You
should
laugh
more
often.
Or
does
it
only
happen
when
I
thought
I
was
smelling
brandy,
I
think
they
loathe
us.
We're
soldiers.
Why
should
we
be
But
it
can't
be,
Let's
go
for
a
walk,
Elisabeth.
Oh,
you
can
always
say
no.
It
must
be
spring
somewhere.
No
one
knows
for
sure
Not
our
worry.
We
didn't
sentence
it,
I
know
just
the
place.
That's
the
excuse
for
everything
we
do.
Or
have
you
been
out
all
day?
No
matter
how
rotten
it
is
I've
been
sitting
behind
a
machine
Line
up!
We
make
Army
overcoats.
The
Labour
Service
asked
me
what
So
they
put
you
to
work
as
a
seamstress?
Yes,
they
must
have
heard
me
play!
Look
alive!
You
are
given
orders
and
you
will
obey.
Without
question.
-
Closed.
I
used
to
come
here
with
my
father.

He'd
drink
beer
and
talk
with
his
friends
I
remember
the
boats
going
by,
Oh,
please,
Ernst.


Oh
Lord
and
master
This
is
where
the
lilacs
must
be.
Smell
it?
I'm
gonna
shoot
over
their
heads.
Must
be
an
early
blooming
variety.
You
won't
be
doing
them
a
favour.
We've
all
tried
that.
I'm
the
only
variety
that's
blooming
early.
It
isn't
every
day
a
district
leader
It's
like
executing
them
twice.

I
think
I'll
volunteer
My
own
sins
and
transgressions.
Let's
go
down
to
the
river.
And
not
judge
my
brother...
Leave
the
cow
for
me,
will
you?

Murderers!
The
first
star.
God
will
punish
you
and
all
Germans!
What
did
you
wish?
That
it
wouldn't
be
an
enemy
bomber.
What
have
you
done?
-
lt
isn't.
I
pray
to
God
that
He
will
grant
My
curse
be
upon
all
of
you.
Is
something
wrong?
They
will
shoot
them
down
No,
nothing.
I
just
thought...
Ask
her
what
she
wants.
She's
cursing
you
and
all
Germans
Oh,
it's
crazy!
I'm
just
not
myself
at
all.
For
every
Russian
that
you
kill,
Well,
whoever
you
are,
For
every
home
you
destroy,
And
smiling.
-
For
each
insignificant
life...
Don't
stop.
It's
the
nicest
thing
I've
seen
in
years.
Kill
us
while
you
still
can!
Ernst,
look.
The
tree!
Kill
us!
Ready!
Up!
Hirschland!
Hold
that
rifle
steady.
It's
blooming!
Long
before
it
should
be.
Take
aim!
That
boat
house
took
a
bomb.
The
heat
of
the
fire
Fire!
Half
the
tree's
gone
but
it
blossoms

If
only
we
could
do
Just
trust
life
and
go
on.
If
only
we
could
do
that.
-
I
tried
to
have
courage
but
suddenly...
I
don't.
I
only
pretend
to
have.
That's
what
we
all
do.
Hey!
Vodka!
Sergeant
Muecke
rounded
it
up!
All
right,
so
she's
been
unfaithful.
It's
a
reward
for
the
firing
squad.
What
do
you
expect,
And
so
what?
She's
not
made
I've
made
up
my
mind.
Why
should
she
be
so
stupid?
As
long
as
she's

wife
of
a
soldier
And
a
very
nice
death

to

out

here,

away
from

No

don't.
All

Oh,

you,
Doctor
Boettcher.
Will
you
do
me
a
favour?
That
won't

rest

to
go
somewhere
special
tonight.

is
such
a

once

best
customer!

The
Germania

Lindenplatz.
Oh,
but
you
see?
Turn
it
off!
It's
patched,
it's
not

pressed.
They're

old
women,
You
have
to
at
least
look
like
It's
always
that
way
after
an
execution.
Turn
that
back
on!
I'll
loan
you
my
uniform,
it's
brand
new
You
do
and
you'll
be
wearing
it
It
won't
fit.
Besides,
I'm
in
a
hurry.
There's
an
official
news
broadcast.
Now,
nothing
starts
at
the
Germania
I'm
not
in
the
mood.
We
will
have
plenty
of

to

first.

it
will
I'll

You
knew
I
would.
Why
aren't
you
inside?
They're
drinking
the
Sergeant's
vodka,
No,
they're
not.
And
what
if
they
were?
Not
drinking
it
won't
change
anything.
Hirschland,
don't

It's
not

easy.
Good

Yes,

how.

you?
No.
I
don't.

went
They
told
me
about
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
old
cathedral.
That's
destroyed
now
too
I
guess.
All
aboard.
Kindly
step
to
the

So
even
if
we
could
go
on
a
honeymoon
To
the
rear
please.
Keep
moving.
Welcome,
friend.
It's
all
been
destroyed
by
bombs
or
hatred.
Elisabeth.
Are
you
enjoying
yourself?
I
might
if
I
could
figure
out
I
know,
I'm
sorry.
Oh,
you
don't.
We
have
all
been
trained
To
us.
Wherever
we
are.
To
us.

Kindly
step
to
the

-
I
saw
that
in
a
movie
once!

Only
I
forget
who
cleaned
it
up.
Oh?
You
feel
it,
Ernst?

I'm
pretty
sure
it
was
someone
with
shoes.

Better
let
me.

"Shortening

"Heavy

Sounds
simple,
doesn't
it?
Thank
God
you
weren't
there.

I
knew
better
than
my
own
family.
Watch
out
for
the
broken
glass.
Ernst?
Let's
both
try
to
forget
Excuse
me.
Frau
Langer?
Remember
me?
Ernst
Graeber.
Yes!
Ernst
Graeber.
Yes.
Do
you
know
where
my
parents
are?
This
is
the
first
night
of
our
marriage.
Maybe
we'll
have
the
same
dream...
They're
dead.
...that
time
stands
still.
My
Lena
and
my
August,
too.
And
in
our
dreams
we
might
find
a
place
You
knew
them
both,
didn't
you?
Dead?
And
won't
ask
our
nationality,
How
did
it
happen?
When?
Did
you
see
it?
And
that
will
be
our
passport
There
was
nothing
to
see.
It
was
all...
fire.
Fire...
Shrieking!
You
there,
soldier!
I
didn't
see
my
Lena
either.
I've
been
waiting
for
you
to
show
up.
I
have
something
for
you.
They
wouldn't
let
me
near
her.
Why
would
they
do
a
thing
like
that,
Ernst?
It
came
in
the
mail
for
Graeber.
It
was
sent
to
Ernst
Graeber
at
the
front
Why?
Why?
Must
have
just
missed
you,
huh?
Herr
Langer...
She...
she
still
can't
grasp
it,
Ernst.
Can
you?
-
It's
from
my
mother.
Or
you?
There's
no
return
address.
If
you
can,
you
are
no
better
They're
alive!
My
parents
are
alive!
...who
caused...
This
was
sent
the
day
they
were
being

They'll
let
me
know
their
address
She
says
my
mother
She
tells
me
not
to
worry!
She
doesn't
know,
Ernst.
I'm
very
glad
for
you.
...that
everyone
who
isn't
here
I'll
take
your
notice
down.
There

our

are.
She
says
things.
We've
been
reported
because
of
it.
Have
you
seen
my
parents
at
all?
Yes,
two
or
three
weeks
ago
How
did
they
look,
were
they
well?
Herr
Graeber?
They
were
alive,
Ernst.
Yes?
I've
something
for
your
wife.
I'm
sorry,
Herr
Langer.
I
promised
I'd
see
that
she
get
it.
I'm
sorry
about
your...
I'll
tell
her.
I
know
A
summons
from
the
Gestapo.
(Drone

They
are
flying
past.
Did
those
people
know
anything
No.
Thank
God
they
didn't
attack.

Oh,
Arnold?
-
Did
you
turn
off
the
gas?
Ah,
that
means
you
didn't.
Dinner
will
be
burnt
to
a

Life
goes
on
again!

When
the
all-clear
sounds,
if
we're
near
Frau
Lieser
isn't
home
yet.
How
can
you
tell?
If
she
were
home,
The

relay
a
broadcast.
She
turns
it
on
full
to
blast
it
-
Professor
Pohlmann.
I
don't
know
how
you
stand
living
-
I'm
Ernst
Graeber,
a
former
pupil.
I
can't.
As
long
as
I'm
here
I
can
hope
If
I
went
away
it
would
be
like
giving
up.
What
do
you
want?
Can
I
see
you
for
a
few
moments,
Professor?
I
need
your
advice.
I
no
longer
have
the
right
I
must
talk
to
you,
Professor.
Thank
you.
There's
no
one
else
I
can
go
to.
Say,
would
you
like
to
go
somewhere?
Anyone
see
you
come
back
here?
You're
just
home
on
furlough,
I'm
sure
No.
Only
the
workmen
out
front.
Workmen?
Good
night.
They
may
be
workmen
but
one
may
not
be.
Good
night.
I'm
being
watched,
Graeber.
Elisabeth!
Come
back
another
time,
Knock
twice
slowly,
Here's
something
for
you.
Oh?
Graeber?
-
It's
food.
And
I
thought...
Yes.
If
the
workmen
ask
you
anything,
But...
I'd
like
you
to
have
it.
Or
even
open
the
door.
I've
nobody
else
to
give
it
to.

And
that's
the
only
reason
You,
soldier.
The
shelter's
a
block
over.
What's
the
matter
with
you?
It's
always
food
packages,
cigarettes
In
broad
daylight?
You
soldiers
expect
every
woman
to...
They're
going
to
make
sure
they
get
How
do
you
know
what
I
expect?
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
Not
because
I
have
to
buy
my
way
around.

I'm
sorry,
but
fighting
Not
even
with
you.
Goodnight.

Good
evening,
soldier.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
all
about
it?
Here,
you
take
it.

And
you
never
saw
such
legs!
Long,
beautiful
and
slim!
And
such
eyes!
And
such
teeth!
Like
a
white
gardenia
flower.
So,
I
opened
the
bottle
of
brandy.
50-year-old
Napoleon,
It
took
only
two
glasses.
So?
Well,
and
then?
Well
that's
as
far
as
a
cavalier
can
tell
It's
an
obscenity,
Reuter.
Oh,
idiot!
How
can
a
man
betray
his
wife
when
If
she
were
here,
I
wouldn't
betray
her.
I
am
simply
the
victim
of
army
life.
Oh,
gentlemen,
we
haven't
welcomed
-
Schilling,
the
bottle.
This
is
home
made
potato
schnapps,
it's
an
insult
to
the
stomach
Give
me
that!
You
know
the
doctor
Everybody
always
wants
to
take
care
of
me.
You
crazy
fool!
Clear
out!
All
my
life,
caviar
and
champagne
-
Which
in
turn
saves
my
life.
Is
that
the
uniform
factory?
It
was.
What
are
you
doing
It's
better
to
be
sick
here
My
wife
works
there.
Was
there
time
Give
me
that...
You
keep
quiet!
There
was
a
power
breakdown.
Come
on.
We've
got
more
important
Most
of
the
workers
were
sent
home.
The
overcoat
section
too?
Give
me
a
hand.
How
should
I
know?
Now
I
can
check
all
the
villages.
They're
Don't
they
keep
a
record
Records
may
be
Why
don't
you
go
home
and
find
out?
When
you
know
your
parents
But
you
can't
relax
just
knowing
She's
got
to
be
with
you.
Especially
when
she
weighs
200
pounds.

It's
simple
for
you.
You
grab
the
first
girl
But
with
me,
where
do
I
find
a
woman
At
the
restaurant,
down
the
street.
The
waitress.
Oh,
fat.
Tired,
flabby,
fat.
-
Frau
Lieser,
have
you
seen
my
wife?
Did
she
get
home?
Is
she
in
the
shelter?
What
shelter?
We
were
flooded
out,
But
my
Alma...
You
could
break
a
finger
And
now
somebody
else
-
You
don't
know
my
Alma.
She's
waiting
some
place
only
for
you.
Like
Nasick's
wife,
huh?
Tell
them
how

Department

Reuter,
one
of
these
days,
I'm
going
to
cripple
your
other
leg
too.
Graeber.
Take
my
advice,
and
waste
your
whole
furlough
Enjoy
your
life
while
you
can.
Have
you
any
idea
how
long
your
life
is?
These
days,
who
does?
Three
weeks.
As
long
as
your
furlough,
Then,
death
holds
the
trumps.
Why,
you've
been
home
three
days
Why
that's
as
much
as
ten
years
Ten
years
of
waste.
Come
on,
let's
get
out
of
here.

Records?
Ha!
If
the
air
raids
continue
There
is
no
space.

Ernst!
Ernst!
Ernst!
Oh!
Elisabeth!
Thank
God
you're
here.
I
went
to
the
factory,
I
saved
all
I
could.
Thank
you.
Well,
I
suppose
we'll
sleep
But
not
this
one,
Ernst.
Why
don't
we
go
to
It's
an
elegant
ruin
as
ruins
go
and
I
want
to
see
Pohlmann
isn't
home.
I
hope
he'll
like
us
for
neighbours.
When
I
was
seven
years
old
I
wanted
A
quiet
night,
a
bed
and
a
woman...
That's
what
we
used
to
-
Did
you
get
a
letter?
In
all
the
excitement
It's
from
my
parents.
They
were
being
evacuated,
Then
they're
alive!
And
you
forgot
that.

Is
someone
there?
It's
Pohlmann.
It's
me,
Professor.
Ernst
Graeber.
We
were
bombed
out
and
I...
We?
Someone
is
with
you?
My
wife.
I
see.
It's
all
right,
Josef.
Ernst,
Josef.
It's
better
not
to
mention
other
names.
I
can't
take
you
and
your
wife
inside.
You
would
be
in
great
danger
With
a
man
who
is
wanted.
Nothing
may
happen
tonight.
The
city
is
always
in
confusion
Professor,
I
must
talk
to
you.
Come
in
for
a
few
minutes.
Have
you
any
idea
why
the
Gestapo
Her
father's
in
a
concentration
camp.
Then
they
must
want
information.
What
would
you
do,
Josef?
Hide.
That's
why
I'm
still
alive.
In
any
case,
interrogation
by
the
Gestapo
Josef
is
a
specialist
in
these
things.
Couldn't
I
go
in
her
place
and
find
out
They'll
tell
you
nothing,
I
know
someone
they
would
tell.
He's
offered
to
help
me.
And
he
has
He's
bragged
to
me
about
them.
To
me
too.
And
he
proved
it.
I'm
supposed
to
go
back
to
the
front
I'll
have
to
see
Binding
in
the
morning,
Thank
you
for
seeing
me.
Ernst.
You
said
if
you
go.
Are
you
thinking
of
I
must
find
out
what
will
happen
to
If
you
desert,
they
will
shoot
you.
There's
a
chance
you
could
That's
practically
impossible.
If
you
know
anyone
hiding
Are
your
parents
alive,
Ernst?
Yes,
but
I
haven't
been
able
to
find
them.
They
would
find
them.
Your
wife
too.
So
I
must
go
back,
just
as
before.
And
do
the
same
things
as
before.
But
how?
I
don't
believe
in
anything
Tell
me,
Professor,
is
there
anything
Yes,
there
is.
-
What?
-
You
still
believe
in
him?
You
never
have
any
doubts?
Of
course
I
have.
Without
doubt,
there
would
be
How
can
anyone
believe
in
God
God
is
not
responsible
to
us.
We
are
responsible
to
God
If
that's
true,
Professor,
Isn't
there
a
time
when
taking
orders
stops
and
personal
responsibility
begins?
When
duty
turns
into
crime
and
can
no
longer
be
excused
I
have
to
make
a
decision,
Professor.
No
one
can
make
that
decision
for
you,
Each
man
has
to
decide
it
for
himself.
But
first
you
must
face
the
truth,
The
war
is
lost,
Ernst.
before
our
country
can
regain
its
soul.
I'm
not
making
it
any
easier
for
you,
am
I?
No.
Harder.
You're
smiling.
Why
aren't
you
screaming?
I
am
screaming,
you
just
don't
hear
it.

Graeber.
Graeber!
Are
you
awake,
Graeber?
Herr
Pohlmann
has
some
coffee
on,
If
it's
all
right,
I'd
like
to
let
her
sleep
Does
she
know
about
the
Gestapo
summons?
I
thought
not.
Graeber.
If
you
find
she's
in
danger
Yes?
Meet
me
at
Saint
Cunibert's.
I'll
have
an
address
for
you
to
go
to.
You'll
find
me
up
in
the
little
storeroom
I
suggest
you
leave
your
belongings
before
going
anywhere
this
morning.
That
way
you
can
have
your
wife
Thank
you.
And
be
careful,


Come
in!
Come
in!
Well!
Do
come
in
said
a
spider
to
the
fly.
Come
in!
Ernst,
boy!
What
a
time
I
know
it's
early
That's
been
going
on
all
night.
But
I'm
glad
you
came
by.
Let's
have
a
drink.
Good,
isn't
he?
I
don't
know
anything
about
music
but
He's
even
been
invited
to
Berchtesgaden
where
he
played
with
such
great
art

Don't
take
my
bottle!
Mustn't
take
bottle
from
baby
baby.
Heini,
I
want
you
to
meet
my
friend,
Ernst.
On
furlough
from
the
Russian
front.
Ha!
I
had
a
great
time
there,
Their
vodka
is
1
20
proof,
We
poured
it
down
their
throats,
You
should
have
seen
them
jump!
It
was
fun,
baby!
Tut
tut
tut.
Careful
with
that.
From
our
own
recipe.
We
call
it
the
layer
cake.
First
you
have
the
prisoners
bring
On
which
they
lay
down.
Then,
one
bullet
for
each.
Heini,
careful
with
that!
And
you're
ready
for
the
next
layer.
Who
also
bring
their
own
wood,
and
so
on.
Sprinkle
liberally
with
gasoline.
And...

Herr
Baby,
your
piano
needs
tuning.
This
note
is
flat.
Mad
fellow
that
Heini.
He's
the
Commander
of
the
camp
here
now.
I
don't
enjoy
that
sort
of
thing.
You
know
me,
You
think
it's
all
right
for
him
to
do
it?
I
don't
think
about
it.
I'm
not
responsible
No,
none
of
us
is
ever
responsible.
That's
what
we
tell
ourselves
when
we're
ordered
to
shoot
hostages.
Your
vodka,
Ernst.
You've
shot
civilians?
Yes
I
have.
Drink!
You're
one
of
us.
I
guess
I
am.
-
Heini!
-
Shall
I
phone
for
your
car?
Ernst
could
take
my
car
and
drive
you...
I
said
I
walk!
Think
I
can?

He's
in
one
of
his
moods.
The
concentration
camp
Another...
layer
cake?
What's
the
difference
how
people
die?
They're
equally
dead.
Maybe
not
the
right
ones.
Ernst,
I'm
very
drunk.
I
don't
understand
a
word
you
say.
So
don't
say
anymore.
You're
right.
I...
I'd
better
not.
Where
are
you
going?
Goodbye,
Oskar.
Who
do
I
see
about
this?
This
is
for

Josef.
It
was
this.
Her
father's
ashes.
I
went
to
Pohlmann's,
he
wasn't
there.
Pohlmann
has
been
arrested.
He
saw
them
coming.
He
ran
into
the
street
so
that
I
could
get
away.
A

it's
almost
like
a
coffin.
Usually
they
use

You
knew
him?
He
was
our
family
physician.
A
fine
man,
and
this
is
all
it
comes
to.
What
do
you
think
I
should
do
with
it?
There
are
graves
in
the

What
will
happen
to
Pohlmann?
And
you?
If
I'm
not
caught,
I'll
survive.
You
must
hate
us.
Hate.
Hate
makes
one
forget
to
be
cautious.
Besides,
I
remember
the
time
before...
the
Germany
I
grew
up
in
and
loved.
And
there's
Pohlmann.
Am
I
to
hate
him?
Or
Pastor
Brenner
Shall
I
hate
them?
-
Are
there
many
like
them?
It
isn't
hopeless.
You
say
that
there's
h
ope!
Of
course.
You'd
better
go
now.
It
will
be
kinder
if
you've
buried
that
Good
luck,
Ernst.
Good
luck,
Josef.
Is
it
your
wish
that
the
child
be
baptised
Yes.
I
baptise
you
Christina
Renata
in
the
name
of
the
Father,
the

and

Amen.

you.
Amen.
Ernst,
I've
nothing
but
good
news!
There's
no
work
until
the
factory
That's
wonderful.
We
can
sleep
late
and
do
anything
we
like.
It's
a
miracle,
isn't
it?
It
would
be
if
we
had
a
place
to
sleep.
We
can't
stay
here,
they
only
take
But
I
only
told
you
the
first
miracle,
It's
not
very
far,
we...
What
are
you
talking
about?
You're
wasting
time!
It's
hardly
touched.
-
lt
must
be
a
mirage.
Frau
Witte!
-
Good
evening,
Herr
Graeber.
Yes,
he's
everything
you
said.
-
We're
not
late,
are
we?
But
first
you'll
want
to
take
How
did
you
find
this
place?
By
accident.
The
street
I
really
don't
serve
meals
anymore,
but
I
couldn't
say
no
to
your
wife.
You
too,
eh?
So
I
decided
the
butcher
In
the
soup,
you'll
find
It's
my
daughter's
room,
her
name
was
Ilse.
It
was
the
second
air
raid
I
never
reported
it,
I
didn't
want
But
I
want
you
to
have
it.
Please,
let
her
stay
on
here,
Thank
you.
When
you
are
ready
for
dinner,
give
me
five
minutes
warning
I
want
our
house
to
be
Tiled
stove
and...
everything.
Can't
you
see
it,
Ernst?
Our
families
together
for
Sunday
dinners,
children
climbing
all
over
them.

Everybody
talking
at
once.
I
didn't
know
you
wanted
children
so
much.
It's
your
children
I
want
to
have.
In
times
like
these
Other
things
frighten
me
more,
My
father's
brought
a
thousand
babies
But
wait
till
you
see
his
face
Oh,
how
he'll
spoil
them!
What
is
it?
Nothing.
Ernst?
What
aren't
you
telling
me?
You're
going
away.
No,
I
would
have
told
you
that.
Then
what?
Is
it
something
I
did?
Something
I
didn't
do?
My
father.
Dead?
Dead.
There
were
still
a
few
bottles
of
wine
And
I
thought
I'll...
Shall
I
serve
dinner
now?
Yes,
Frau
Witte,
please.
Soldier,
you
must
be
insane.
New
orders
come
through
every
hour
But
you're
not
satisfied
with
even
Sir,
my
wife...
Broke
her
leg?
Is
having
twins?
We
were
just
married,
sir.
Even
if
it
meant
one
more
day,
You're
due
out
on
a
troop
transport.
The
train
leaves
at
6
in
the
morning
Report
here
at
5.
Even
Reuter
would
approve
of
Berndtcassler,
1
935.
According
to
Reuter,
if
we
just
had
some
lobster!
Don't
open
it,
Ernst.
This
one
will.

I'm
not
really
crying.
And
if
I
do
cry,
don't
worry
about
it.
It
isn't
sorrow.
I'm
happy.
So
much
has
happened
in
these
weeks,
I
can't
press
it
all
into
myself.
I've
tried,
but
it
won't
go.
Tonight
you
must
be
patient
with
me.
I
wish
I'd
taken
you
out
of
the
city,
to
a
village
or
somewhere.
Even
if
I
didn't
have
to
work
Because
I'll
need
to
be
some
place
Do
you
want
to
sleep
now?
I
can
sleep
on
the
train
all
the
way
there.
Then?
Will
you
ever
have
a
bed?
The
best
I
can
hope
for
after
tomorrow
or
a
sack
of
hay
from
time
to
time.
It's
not
that
bad.
You
get
used
to
it
It's
the
winter
that...
As
soon
as
I
hear
from
my
parents
If
they're
anywhere
close,
I
will.
They're
gonna
love
you.
Kiss
them
from
me.


Everyone
to
the
shelter!
Herr
Graeber!
Herr
Graeber,
the
air
raid
shelter
is
Ernst!
No
matter
what
happens,
I
don't
want
to
spend
my
last
night
Could
we
stay?
I
understand.
I'll
tell
the
warden


Ernst.
What
happens
if
the
planes
Or
maybe
the
train?
They'd
make
us
walk.
Darling,
please
don't
Last
time,
my
mother
went
with
me
and
there
was
this
nervous,
weeping
woman
saying
the
same
things
over
and
over.
Not
my
mother
as
she
really
is
at
all.
No,
we
shouldn't
do
that
to
each
other.
-
ls
this
seat
vacant?
Maxl,
say
goodbye
to
your
daddy.
The
child,
must
be
tired.
He
can
wait.

I
wish
you
had
stayed
home.




Fourth
Company!
Graeber!
Over
here!
Immerman!

Well,
if
it
isn't
the
furlough
boy!
-
Sauer!
You
crazy
fool,
why
didn't
you
stay
home?
The
rate
we're
running
What
brought
you
back
to
this
muck?

How
did
you
find
us?
Came
up
with
an
engineer
outfit.
Been
looking
for
you
guys
for
two
weeks.

Oh,
relax.
Sling
that
rifle
back
on
your
shoulder,
we
haven't
had
anything
They
keep
pounding
us
with
artillery,
when
they
run
out
of
shells,
we
rest.
And
pretty
soon
they've
got
more
shells.
-
Sauer!
Get
those
men
out
of
there!
Move
out
of
there.
What
are
you
doing?
Graeber!
I
don't
know
how
you
got
here,
How
was
it
at
home?
I
know.
Come
on.
Come
on,
keep
moving.
Come
on.
Relax,
boy.
They
haven't
found
us
yet.

Sauer,
I
think
I'm
catching
cold.
Don't
worry,
your
insurance
is
paid
up.
Yeah,
but
my
wife's
too
stupid.
She
wouldn't
know
how
to
collect
it.
Hey,
Sauer,
look!
-
I'll
get
it.

Hey,
this
must
have
been
a
brewery!

Keep
moving!
Sauer,
Graeber,
move...
Sir.

Keep
moving.
Keep
moving!
Sauer!
Keep
moving!
Go
on!
Stay
here
and
rest.
Break
rank.
Mail!
Mail!
Emmerich.
Dead.
Zender.
Dead.
Dead.
Immerman.
Smith.
Graeber.
From
my
wife!
Keep
moving.
Pick
up
your
feet.
We
found
them
hiding
in
a
cellar,
sir.
-
Did
you
find
any
weapons?
Then
how
can
you
be
sure?
We'll
hold
them
until
we
can
But
where?
The
grain
storehouse
by
the
lake
has
All
right.
Take
them
and...
Graeber.
Yes,
sir.
Take
charge
of
these
prisoners.
They
are
to
be
locked
up
and
guarded.
-
Lamas.
You'll
show
him
where.
Krüger.
Nothing
for
you,
sir.
There's
nobody
to
write.
You
should
have
gotten
to
us
yesterday,
Why
don't
you
get
yourself
some
rest?
Fine.
I
could
use
it.

'I'm
writing
this
sitting
under
'It's
growing
and
living
again
as
though
'You
told
me
we
must
be
like
that
too,
'We're
going
to
have
a
child,
Ernst.
'And
the
thought
of
our
child
'Except
you.
'Frau
Witte
says
it
doesn't
matter
to
her
'as
long
as
it's
a
girl!
'I
will
now
write
to
your
parents
'You

the
address
Graeber!
Graeber!
Get
back
to
the
platoon.
Where
are
you
going?
We're
not
gonna
hold
them
with
us.
Get
going,
I'll
finish
them
off.
I'm
responsible
for
them.
All
right,
then
you
do
it.
I'll
let
you
have
the
honour.
It's
no
honour.
-
But
it
is
an
order.
Do
you
know
who
you
are
talking
to?
I
know
exactly
who
I'm
talking
to.

Go!
You're
free!
Well,
go!
German
beast!
