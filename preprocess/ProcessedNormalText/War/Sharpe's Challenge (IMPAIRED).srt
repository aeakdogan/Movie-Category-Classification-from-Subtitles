Open
the
gate.
All
right,
lads,
fall
out.
-Davi,
get
some
grub
going.
Master
Richard
sahib.
I
have
to
tell
you
that
we
have
no
grub.
We
haven't,
no.
But
they
have.
That
would
be
stealing,
sahib.
How
am
I
to
be
a
good
British
soldier
It
isn't
thieving
when
you're
hungry,
Davi.
Now
go
on,
get
on
with
you.
Davi,
mind
you
watch
Yes,
sahib.
You
there!

Yes,
yes,
you
fellow.
I
don't
know
how

here
in

Sergeant
Sharpe.
King's

sir.
Reporting
from
Srirangapattam.
You're
here
for
the
cartridges
we
recovered.
Yes,
sir.
80,000,
sir.
Srirangapattam's...
six
days'
march.
How
the
devil
-On
your
back?
Ox
carts,
sir.
Which
you
mean
to
hire
with
what?
Promises?
Hire
them
with
money,
sir.
Oh.
Speak
the
language,
too,
do
you?
Sergeant,
banker
and
interpreter.
I
brought
an
interpreter,
sir.
Did
you?
Did
you?
Every
inch
the
Crown

Go
and
find
your
damn
carts,
Sergeant
Sharpe.
Thank
you,
sir.
MAN:
Pass
me
some
meat.
CROSBY:
Sergeant
Sharpe!
Hop
to,
lads.
On
your
feet.
I
thought
you
were
about
finding
carts,
Sergeant.
Grub
first,
sir.
Well,
your
food,
I
hope.
Chasalgaon's
an
East
India
Company
station.
We
don't
keep
rations
Oh,
yes,
sir.
Our
food,
sir.
Company
troops
approaching,
sahib.
Well,
who
the
hell
is
it?
Not
sure,
sir.
Sullivan,
perhaps.
Breaking
in
a
new
company.
I've
never
met
Sullivan,
sir.
Subedar!
Call
out
the
guard.
Better
give
the
bastard
a
salute
when
he
arrives.
Tell
him
he
can
join
me
for
dinner.
-You
too,
I
suppose.
Welcome
to
Chasalgaon,
sir.
Major
Crosby's
compliments
Squad,
attention.
Present
arms!
-Is
that
stew
about
ready
yet?
A
bloody
camel
could
do
it
faster.
I'm
going
for
a
piss.
Front
face!
Order
arms!
Should
I
have
your
horse
watered,
sir?
All
in
good
time,
Captain.
All
in
good
time.
Fix
bayonet!
I
like
to
give
a
fellow
Englishman
a
proper
salute.
-Yes,
sir.
From
Norfolk,
sir.
Too
many
damn
Scots
in
the
Company
these
days.
Too
many
Scots
and
Irish.
Then
they
aren't
English,
are
they?
Not
English
at
all.
Present!
Oh,
my
God.
Come
on,
boys.
Fire!
Christ
all-bloody-mighty.
There!
There!
What's
the
matter,
Captain?

King's
men,
to
me!
Well
left!
Well
left,
Captain...

DAVI:
Richard
sahib!
Who
the

are
you?
Major
William
Dodd...

Subedar!

will
you
take
me
to

Splendid.
Splendid.
This

What's
this

I
hear?
You've
turned

to

Aye.
It's
true
enough,
Your
Grace.
Suits
you,

Well,
no

Who
is
he?
Khande

I'm

we'll

You're
off
to
join

You
have
experience
of
India,
Mr
Sharpe?
Experience?
Aye,
some.
I
was
at
Srirangapattam
and
Assaye.
Then
you
should
know,
Mr
Sharpe,
Any
threat
from
Khande
Rao's

-You
mean
the
Battle
of
Assaye?
There
were
no

I
do,
ma'am.
And
you're

Well,

I'd

I'd

It

I'm
looking

A
man
called
Harper.
Patrick

-You

-That's
him.
I
knew

was

uh,
six

ago.

-Could
I
ask,

who
you
might
be?
General
William
Dodd.
Formerly
of
the
honourable...
honourable
East

Company.
Now,
happily
Commander-in-Chief

-Do
you
joke
with

sir?
But
I
do
have
a
paradox
Present!
I'm
sorry,
Mr
Sharpe,


What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
You're
supposed
to
be
dead.
Sure,
I
can't
watch
your
arse
By

Pat.
I
don't
think
much

You're

What
the
bloody
hell
were
you
doing

been
too
long

You
know
how
it
is.
Your
Lucille
can't
be
too
happy
about
you...
Last
winter.
A
fever.
Oh,
Jesus,
no.
I'm...I'm
so
sorry.
She
was
a
rare
lady.
Aye.
Aye,
she
was
that.
Mr
Harper?
Well...
it
would
appear
we
have
all
been
premature
Luck
of
the
Irish,
Captain.
You
can't
beat
it.

Damn
it.
There
is
one
comfort,
though.

Where
are

be
many
miles
Colonel,
I
will
send
but
we
must
report
Khande
Rao
is
in
Ferraghur,
It
has
never
fallen.



Kneel
before
His
Majesty
Khande
Rao.
I
shall
do
no
such
thing.
Highness,
your
loyal
commander-in-chief
The
daughter
of
the
mighty
general
kneels
before
you.
I'm
afraid
there's
not
much
meat
on
her
I'm
sure,
given
encouragement,
No!
God
damn
you,
sir,
for
shame.
Your
Highness!
Permit?
Colonel
Gudin,
Nothing
more.
India
is
not
France.
You
would
do
well
to
remember
it.
What
is
your
name,
British
soldier?
Captain
Lawrence.
I've
lately
consulted
with
the
Brahmin,
hoping
to
gain
the
answer
Perhaps
you
can
confirm

lay
siege
to
us
here

know
that

Oh,

make
no

Is
the
prisoner
fit
for
punishment,
Prisoner
fit
for
punishment,
sir.
Very
well,
do
your
duty.
One!
Two!
No,
no,
no!
By
God,
sir,
but
this
won't
do!
Lay
it
on
hard,
man.
Don't
tickle
him!
You
heard
General
Simmerson,
lay
it
on!
And
keep
those
strokes
high,
above
his
trousers.
Three!
Four!
-What's
this
poor
sod
done,
then,
Simmerson?
-Farted
upwind
of
your
nobility?
Wait!
Sharpe!
I
see
time
has
done
nothing
Still
the
same
Aye.
And
you're
still
the
same
cruel,
flogging
bastard.
Cruel,
sir?
I
calls
it
discipline.
This
fellow
was
caught
wearing
paint
and
earrings
Joys,
he
names
'em.
Joys.
The
marks
and
trinkets
of
his

Well,
I
won't
have
it,
sir.
Sepoys
they
may
be,
but
this
is
a
Christian
army
There's
no
doubting
that.
What's
your
business
here,
Sharpe?
My
business
is
with
General
Burroughs.
Indeed.
-How
long?
The
fever
ebbs
and
flows
but,
alas,
never
leaves
him
in
sufficient
health
to
command.
So
who's
in
charge?
Back
so
soon,
General.
I
thought
you
to
be
Bad
tidings,
McRae,
bad

And
no
worse

some
months
back.
I
hope
she's
giving
you

You
should
be
wary
of

McRae.
He
thinks
that
it
somehow
makes
him
a

-But
he
don't
know
his

Do

Sharpe?
But
I
know

spoke
of

Miss
Burroughs
and

You
see,
McRae,
what
did
I
tell
you?
First
General
Burroughs
indisposed,
now
this.
I
shall
send
to
Agra
for
reinforcements
Further
orders?
What
further
orders
do
you
need?
The
second
rule
of
war,
Sharpe,
which
you'd
know
if
you'd
ever
learned
anything
is
never
reinforce
failure.
Oh,
I
know
that
rule.
it
seems
this
army's
resolved
Sir,
if
Major
Stokes'
artillery
we
must
move
against
the
fortress
I
shall
consider
your
advice,
of
course,
McRae.
And
what
does
that
mean?
-We
wait?
What
of
General
Burroughs'
daughter?

Do
not
be
afraid.
I
am
the
Rani
Lalima.
Sister
to
His
Highness.
Well,
what
do
you
want?
To
gloat
on
my
misfortune?
I
thought
perhaps...
Do
you
imagine
I
would
accept
anything
My
father
will
not
stand
idly
by,
madame.
Even
now,
he
will
be
marshalling
his
army.




I
must
admit,
despite
his
being
a
Frenchman,
And
when
will
they
be
ready?
Soon,
Madhuvanthi.
Soon.
And
after
you've
made
the
Plains
once
you
have
ground
them
into
the
dirt,
what
then,
my
love?
Patience,
Madhuvanthi.
Patience?
Have
I
not
been
patient?
And
more.
You
know
it.
Did
I
put
Khande
Rao
on
his
father's
throne
Have
we
not
come
far
already?
Or
do
you
forget?
A
Company
lieutenant
with
no
prospect
Now
I
am
a
general
and
you
a
regent.
I
shall
not
be
Regent
forever.
Soon
Khande
Rao
will
attain
his
majority
But
perhaps
you
weary
of
me,
my
love.
Is
that
it?
You
want
someone
younger
to
rule
beside
you.
Lalima,
perhaps.
I've
seen
how
you
watch
after
where
she
walks.
I'd
keep
a
close
eye
on
her
She's
of
no
consequence.
She'll
do

All
I
ask,
my
love,
is
that
you
do
not
make
me
wait
too
long
When
I
tells
you
to
shine
my
boots,
Private,
I
means
I
wants
them
gleaming!
But,
Sergeant
Bickerstaff,
you
know
full
well
Oh!
A
Hindu
says
he.
A
Hindu.
What's
a
Hindu
then,
eh?
Know
what
I
bloody
hates
the

There's
no
Hindus
here!
Neither

nor

You
signed
on
as
a
soldier,
Private,
and
a

I'll
make
of
you
yet.
I
signed
on
to
fight
for
your
army,
Do
you
tell
me,
boy?
I
can
see
Shadrach
Bickerstaff
has
to
teach
you
better
to
mind
your
manners.
-All
right,
stand
off,
Sergeant.
Don't
make
me
tell
you
again.
Who
the
bloody
hell
are
you
to
give
me
orders?
You're
no
Company

No,
Sergeant
Bickerstaff,
I'm
not.
that
knows
how
to
deal
Now,
you
raise
your
arm
to
this
man
and
you'll
have
me
to
deal
with.
Now
stand
off.
-Oh,
what's
it
to
you?
Nowt,
beyond
I
know
what
it's
like
-Now
stand
off!
with

and

I
hope
you
sleep
light,
Colonel.
Lest
you
find
some
morning
-Is
that
a
threat,
Sergeant?
Oh,
I
do.
So
come
on,

I
weren't
born
yesterday
neither,
Colonel.
'Tis
a
hanging
offence
to
strike
at
an
officer.
-But
like
you
said,
I'm
no
Company
officer.
I'll
not
hit
a
man
wearing
the
King's
uniform.
No?
No?
Well,
that's
easily
remedied.
Officers!
I've
shat
'em.
Shadrach.
All
right,
all
right!
Clear
off.
Next
time
I
give
an
order,
Aye,
sir.
Richard!
Come
on
to
me
with
a
knife,
will
you?
Had
enough,
Shadrach?

The
French
heavy
cavalry
came
on
in
good
order,
the
morning
sun
glinting
on
their
sword
tips.
But
my
heart
was
not
dismayed.
What
do
you
say,
Stokes,
which
suits
better?
Stokes!
-Sir?
Um...
-As
you
have
it,
sir.
As
you
have
it.
Glinting.
Set
it
down,
set
it
down.
My
troops
as
one,
look
to
their
leader
for,
for...
What?
What
is
this?
I
have
said
that
when
I
am
about
What
is
it?
A
message
from
Khande
Rao.
Poor
Captain
Lawrence.
They
killed
him
with
a
nail,
McRae.
A
nail
driven
into
his
skull!
It
was,
General,
but
not
by
any
hammer.
This
is
the
work
of
jetties,
Killing
people
in
interesting
ways
There's
a
note
along
with
the
thing.
Written
in
their
heathen
script.
It
is
a
short
message
and
to
the
purpose,
General.
If
we
attack
Ferraghur,
Khande
Rao
You
see,
gentlemen?
As
I
thought.
Our
best
course
lies
in
caution.
The
longer
we
leave
him
unchallenged,
Khande
Rao
has
got
Another
month,
it
could
be
double
that.
No
matter
their
strength,
a
bandit
rabble
in
want
of
discipline
will
never
That
must
be
why
they
have
a
bunch
under
the
command
of
a
Colonel
Gudin.
For
a
horse
dealer,
Mr
Harper,
Well,
sir,
you
see,
than
just
shit
on
his
boots,
sir.
Khande
Rao
is
not
just
marshalling
-You
must
move
now.
Damn
it,
sir,
don't
push
me.
We
will
wait
until
reinforcements
and
new
orders
There
is
no
more
to
say.
Get
that
damn
thing
out
of
here.
What
do
you
reckon
then,
Pat?
-This
Khande
Rao,
can
we
take
him?
If
he
is
a
monster,
Mr
Harper,
How
is
that,
Captain?
The
Company
have
only
maintained
the
peace
here
Khande
Rao's
father...

...he
feared
his
neighbours
And
so
it
was
your
country
That
sounds
just
like
the
English,
The
son
is
not
the
father,
however.
Khande
Rao
wants
you
out
of
our
country
It
is
a
view
with
which
I
cannot
say
So
why
are
you
fighting
with
us?
Khande
Rao
is
a
Maratha,
Colonel,
And
that
makes
you
my
enemy's
enemy.
Good
day
to
you,
both.
I
don't
think
I
like
the
sound
of
that,
-Have
we
ever
been
else?
And
there
was
me
thinking
What
keeps
my
brother
from
sleep?
I
dreamt
of
our
father.
He
was
angry
with
me.
I
shall
ask
the
Brahmin
what
it
means.
I
try
to
be
like
him
in
all
things.
To
find
his
courage
within
me,
that
I
may
see
No
one
doubts
your
courage,
my
lord,
But
surely
a
great
prince
is
also
merciful.
I
speak
of
the
white
general's
daughter.
My
brother,
what
harm
has
she
done?
Can
it
be
right
You
think
the
British
would
treat
you
any
better?
Then
surely
it
becomes
us
to
prove
that
Release
her
to
the
guest
quarters
Do
this
kindness
for
a
sister
who
loves
you.
-I
will
ask
Madhuvanthi.
-You
are
the
Rajah
of
Ferraghur.
Tell
me,
when
the
time
comes
do
you
imagine
she
will
do
so
gracefully
-She
and
Dodd...
General
Dodd
has
served
us
faithfully
well
It
was
our
father's
wish
and
I
will
not
go
against
that
wish.
As
my
brother
pleases.
You
know
what
they
are
calling
him?
The
white
Rajah.
The
white
Rajah.
Take
care,
my
little
brother.
Take
care.
Christ,
God,
Sharpe!
You
heard
his
message.
Attack
Ferraghur
Not
if
I
can
get
her
out.
Get
her
out?
What
fresh
madness
is
this?
You
want
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
against
Ferraghur,
Have
half
my
men
killed
on
the
walls,
If
Captain
Singh
and
his
lancers
help
me,
Mr
Harper
and
I
should
prove
sufficient
to
the
job.
You
and
Harper,
eh?
Oh,
God
knows...
I
don't
mind
if
you
do
die,
Sharpe.
If
that's
permission...
Oh,
by
all
means.
Go
and
die,
Sharpe.
Go
and
die.
Mademoiselle,
it
is
His
Highness'
wish
that
you
should
be
brought
There
you
may
bathe
I
am
well
enough,
sir.
It
is
not
a
request.
I
have
been
a
very
poor
father.
The
effort
of
bringing
Celia
into
the
world
took
my
dear
wife
from
me,
do
you
see?
I
may
not
always...
have
concealed
my
resentment.
I'm
sure
that's
not
the
case,
sir.
A
son
could
have
followed
me
into
the
army...
but
a
daughter...
I
placed
career
before
the
duty
a
father
owes
to
his
child.
It's
only
now
as...
the
shadows
lengthen
and
I
realise,
the
value
of
that
which
I
squandered.
Bring
her
back
for
me,
Colonel.
-Are
we
ready,
Pat?
Godspeed,
then,
to
you
both.
-I
trust
your
new
quarters
are
more
to
your
liking.
I
hardly
think
it
proper
for
you
to
be
alone
Fortunately,
madam,
-What
is
it
you
want?
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
sir,
It
was
the
East
India
Company
in
which
I
served.
But
let's
not
split
hairs
over
such
trifling
matters.
Your
point?
My
point,
sir,
is
that
if
any
vestige
you
must
have
absorbed
I
would
urge
you
to
act
upon
it.
Alas,
madam,
these
past
years,
sub-equatorial.
If
I
understood
you
aright
you
made
a
gift
of
me
to
the
Rajah.
-What
of
it?
I
am
merely
imagining
his
disappointment
if
he
were
to
find
that
his
gift
Then
you
better
wish
a
health
unto
His
Highness
for
he'll
take
more
care
in
its
opening
than
I
will.
All
right,
I
reckon
this
is
about
far
enough,
Pat.
Turn
your
coat
round.
If
Khande
Rao's
men
see
red
coats,
Wouldn't
want
that
to
happen
now,
would
we?
She
must
be
some
looker,
that's
all
I
can
say.
-All
the
trouble
we're
going
to.
-The
general's
daughter.
We're
going
to
Ferraghur
to
stop
a
rebellion.
You
know
as
well
as
me
Khande
Rao
can
afford
while
Simmerson's
men
starve
for
lack
of
supplies.
Then,
when
he's
got
them
on
the
run,
he'll
get
his
Pindari
to
carry
them
So
wait
a
minute.
You
and
me,
Well,
I
don't
see
no
bugger
else.
Yeah...
That...
That
sounds
just
about
right,
Shh!
What
do
you
want?
I
came
to
tell
you
I
am
sorry
Keep
your
apology,
madame.
It's
nothing
to
me.
We
did
not
ask
you
British
to
our
country.
But
not
as
guests,
nor
in
friendship.
-You
came
to
plunder,
nothing
more.
We
are
not
savages,
madam,
All
we
want
is
to
be
left
to
run
our
own
affairs.
I
would
be
grateful
if
you
would
leave
me.
Promise
me
one
thing,
madam.
Were
you
to
attempt
escape,
I
should
suffer
for
it.
His
Highness
would
not
approve
of
you
What
my
brother
might
or
might
not
approve
of
Indeed
not,
madam.
However,
the
well-being
What
did
you
want
with
her?
You
are
aware,
madam,
that
as
I
am
duty-bound
to
report
this
behaviour.
Nevertheless,
I
am
willing
to
be
persuaded
that
your
conduct
was
other
than
it
first
appeared.
Persuaded?
And
what
about
Madhuvanthi?
Or
do
you
tire
of
a
courtesan's
tricks
at
last?
You
should
return
to
the
palace,
madam.
The
streets
of
the
fortress
can
be
dangerous
Should
a
common
soldier
mistake
you
who
knows
what
accident
might
befall?
Don't
look,
I
think
we're
being
followed.

It's
about
time!
Get
out,
man.
You've
done
your
job,
get
out.

Friends,
mate.
Friends.
You
understand?
We
don't
wanna
fight
you.
-We
wanna
come
and
join
you.
-You're
deserters?
-That's
why
them
buggers
are
chasing
us.
-Corporal
Harper.
Surrender
your
weapons
If
it
proves
you
are
what
you
say,
If
not,
you
will
die.
I'm
afraid
General
Dodd
will
insist
upon
it.
So,
you
wish
to
enlist
in
the
army
Aye,
sir,
that's
why
we're
here.
And
tell
me,
Sergeant
Sharpe,
I'm
never
sure
deserters
are
to
be
trusted.
We
were
to
be
flogged,
sir,
-Why?
We
didn't
do
it
We
had
nowhere
else
to
run,
sir.
It
were
either
offer
ourselves
here
Why
should
I
accept
you
You
give
me
a
rifle
at
me
shoulder
This
Rajah
is
no
more
your
king
than
he
is
mine.
But
we'll
kill
for
him,
Colonel,
same
as
you.
Though
I'll
be
damned
You
are
for
the
moment
attached
to
my
cushoon
You
shall
be
issued
with
the
proper
uniform
and
Sergeant
Chef
Bonnet
-Aye,
sir.
Les
fuck-offs,
n'est-ce
pas?
-What's
that?
-I'm
Irish,
sir.
Cinq
minutes.

Best
not
to
keep
What
is
it?
Nowt.
And
you
with
a
face
on
you
like
a
dragoon's
arse
Hmm?
Listen,
I'd
follow
you
through
the
gates
of
hell
So
I
think
I
deserve
more
than
a
''nowt''
Dodd.
''General
Dodd
will
insist,''
Gudin
said.
Who
is
he?
The
Company
renegade
-And
for
two?
Do
you
know
him?
Does
he
know
you?
He
had
a
lot
on
his
mind
that
day
at
Chasalgaon.
Chasalgaon?
Shite.
Well,
I'll
take
that
as
a
''Let's
hope
not''
then.
-How
fares
General
Burroughs,
sir?
Perhaps
we
should
delay
our
approach
Delay,
sir?
No,
we
cannot.
The
rains
maybe
upon
us
in
days,
hours
perhaps.
We
must
press
on.
-Your
Highness.
So,
what
news
of
the
wolves
at
our
door?
Intelligence
from
our
scout
says
Perhaps
they
have
thought
better
-Falling
back,
Colonel
Gudin?
If
the
rains
come,
they
will
have
to
abandon
You
sound
almost
eager
GUDIN:
I
have
never
walked
away
from
a
battle,
Like
any
soldier,
If
it's
peace
that
you
want,
you
better
hope
My
father
knows
his
duty.
Depend
on
it.
As
he
knows
how
to
deal
with
renegades.
Be
silent,
and
speak
only
when
you
are
spoken
to.
We
have
consulted
with
our
Brahmins.
-They
say
the
rains
are
coming
very
soon.
Or
how
else
will
we
swill
the
Plain
clean

HARPER:
Boy!
Boy!
-More
arrack
here.
Yes,
yes.
I
thought
you
crapauds
could
drink.
Are
you
all
Frenchmen
There
used
to
be
many
more
of
us.
We
came
seeking
a
place
and
fortune,
but
men
die
here
like
flies.
The
fever,
the
heat.
It
has
been
a
long
march
from
Waterloo.
Aye.
It
has
that.
-You
were
there?
How
any
of
us
lived
through
it...
Mon
dieu.
Yet,
here
we
are.
Such
is
God's
humour.
For
all
that,
it's
not
so
bad.
And
beaucoup
de
bbs...
Come
on,
Jacques,
come
on.
Who
was
that
-That
one's
far
beyond
your
purse,
my
friend.
The
daughter
of
a
British
general.
-Dodd
made
a
gift
of
her
to
the
Rajah.
Much
as
another
man
might
hang
His
Highness
likes
to
have
her
about
him
while
he
makes
his
plans
for
war.
So
amongst
my
other
duties,
I
am
appointed
her
chaperone.
And
escort
her
from
the
guest
quarters
to
wherever
His
Highness
pleases.
Such
is
my
misfortune.
Sounds
like
a
funny
misfortune
to
me.
She
is
very
beautiful,
yes.
Mon
dieu,
quelle
ptasse!
Un
shrew
sans
pareille.
More
arrack,
Jacques.
More
arrack.

-Whoa!
We
shall
all
have
sore
heads
tomorrow.
Well,
you
will,
anyhow,
Jacques.

I'll
put
him
to
bed.
Come
on.

-If
you
please.
Sergeant
Sharpe.
At
least
for
now.
If
you
would.
-Forgive
me...
That's
all
right.
Don't
fret
your
self,
you
did
right.
Sergeant
Sharpe,
might
I
assume
this
subterfuge,
indeed
your
very
presence
at
Ferraghur,
-It
is,
ma'am.
I
regret
to
say
General
Burroughs
is
He's
taken
pretty
bad.
-And
like
to
die?
And
he's
in
the
best
of
care.
Who,
then,
controls
his
army?
The
army
is
at
present
Then
it
is
indeed
worse
than
I'd
feared.
Then
your
father's
a
good
judge,
ma'am.
I
know
Sir
Henry
of
old,
which
is
why
we
must
Have
you
a
proposal
I'm
working
upon
it,
ma'am.
But
I'm
also
here
to
reconnoitre
Sergeant,
if
there
is
a
choice
and
taking
what
intelligence
Whatever
we
do,
Now,
I
must
back
to
my
building
Don't
you
worry.
-Good
night,
ma'am.
Barrel
caked
in
powder.
Come
on.
Missing
frisson
spring.
SHARPE:
Rusted
dog
screw.
Would
you
say
HARPER:
That
I
wouldn't,
Sergeant.
What
would
happen
if
any
of
our
men
kept
their
pieces
in
such
a
condition,
Well,
they'd
have
cause
to
curse
their
mothers
for
ever
bringing
them
What
the
hell
are
two
English
soldiers
They
are
deserters,
sir.
So
you
just
thought
you'd
just
let
-My
orders
were
to
build
an
army.
I
think
General
Dodd's
point
is
How
can
one
tell,
Highness?
But
I
think
not.
-I
have
questioned
them.
I
think
we
can
discover
How
many
rounds
can
you
fire
a
minute?
One,
maybe?
A
good
soldier,
he
can
fire
maybe
three,
DODD:
Perhaps
you
should
demonstrate,
Sergeant.
Oh,
aye.
Who
might
you
be?
I'd
be
General
Dodd,
Sergeant...?
Sharpe.
Corporal
Harper,
sir.
Load
them.
Getting
slow,
Pat.
So,
you
can
load.
-Can
you
shoot?
-I
can
kill
and
all.
Then
kill
him.
What?
Wait
a
minute!
Wait
a
minute!
What's
this?
Proof
of
your
new-found
loyalty
to
His
Highness.
Kill
him
or
I'll
have
you
both
shot
as
spies.
Sir,
I've...served
with
this
man
for
six
years,
sir.
Well,
you
must
be
bored
of
his
conversation.
Don't
try
His
Highness'
patience,
kill
him.
-Pat.
Aim
true
for
Christ's
sake.
Hail
Mary
full
of
grace.
The
Lord
is
with
thee.
and
blessed
is
the
fruit
of
thy
womb,
Jesus.
I
know
who
the
traitors
are
in
here!
I
know!
Your
army
is
gonna
be
utterly
destroyed.
Charge!
Enter!
