Go
inside.
Hurry
up.
This
way.
Hurry
up.
Yeah,
this'll
do.
-
I...
Allez
hup!
How
far
are
the
trees,
Danny?
Over
200
feet.
Yeah,
I'd
say
300.
Long
ways
to
dig.
We'll
get
Cavendish
to
make
a
survey.
Willie,
you
think

He'd
have

I'll

Yes.
Thank
you.

I
am

Von

Please
sit
down.
Group
Captain
Ramsey,
the
Reich
has
been
forced
to
spend
energy,
manpower
and
equipment
hunting
down
escaping
At
least
it's
rather
nice
For
us
it's
not
a
matter
for
levity.
Colonel
Von
Luger,
it
is
the
sworn
duty
If
they
can't,
it
is
their
duty
to
use
an
inordinate
number
and
their
sworn
duty
to
harass
Yes,
I
know.
The
men
under
your
authority
This
man,
Ashley-Pitt,
for
example.
Caught

Group
Captain,
this
is
close
to
insanity.
-
Quite.
Colonel,
do
you
expect
officers
No.
It
is
because
we
expect
the
opposite
This
is
a
new

It
has
been

It
is
organised
to
incorporate
all
And
in
me,
you

not

a

We

we
intend
to
watch
Very
wise.
You
will
not
be
denied
the
usual
facilities.
Sports,
a
library,
a
recreation
hall,
and
for
gardening
we
will
give
you
tools.
We
trust
you
to
use
them
for
gardening.
Devote
your
energies
to
these
things.
Give
up
your

And,
with
intelligent
cooperation,
we
may
all
sit
out
the
war
as
comfortably
as
possible.
-
What
do
you
do
here
by
the
truck?
-
For
stealing
tools,
cooler.
-
Oh,
you're
American.
Of
course.
-
Why
fight
for
England,
your
enemy?
-
In
181
2
they
burned
your
capital.
It's
in
the
history
books.
I
read
it.
Now
go
away
from
here.
Yeah.
No
tools.
Hey,
Virgil.
Hey,
did
you
see
the
cooler?
Boy,
is
it
ever
a
big
one!
-
I
think
they
expect
a
lot
of
business.
Those
two
guys
who
were
with
us
in
-
You
think
the
goons
left
'em
behind?
What
were
their
names?
-
And
Dexter.
I'm
gonna
see
who
else
I
can
find.
Hey,
Danny.
Who
are
they?
Russian
prisoners.
They
cut
down
trees.
-
They
keep
them
here?
Willie,
cigarettes.
Danny
and
I
have
a
blitz
in
mind.
Could
Sure,
man.
What'll
it
be?
An
all-out
go?
-
Choir
practice?
-
Yeah.
Knuckles
will
be
fine.
-
What
are
you
doing
with
my
coat,
mate?
Are
you
pushing
me?
That's
mine,
you
son
of
a...
Stop
it!
Stop
this
nonsense!
It's
all
right,
mate.
We're
just
-
No
more
fighting.
No
more!
-
Back
in
your
huts.
You,
too!
Get
away!
Get
back
in
your
huts!
Go
on!
Hey,
Hilts.
Looks
like
there's
only
Some
guy
named
Hendley
Hey,
you
got
something
goin'
already?
See
the
way
the
goons
-
There's
a
blind
spot
through
the
middle.
A
guy
could
stand
at
that
wire
They'd
never
see
me,
especially
at
night.
-
You're
crazy.
Now,
the
next
step's
a
little
tricky.
-
You're
not
goin'
out
there?
I
think
I'll
take
a
little
walk.
-
Danny,
you
speak
Russian?
Let
me
have
it,
mate.
-
What's
it
mean?
I
love
you?
What
bloody
good
is
that?
I
don't
know.
Out.
Out!
-
Your
friend,
yes?
And
who
vouches
for
you,
Get
out,
Sedgwick.
Hold
it,
hold
it!
-
Your
name?
Ives.
Ives.
Oh,
yes.
Archibald
Ives.
Scots.
The
photograph
doesn't
do
you
justice.
I'd
like
to
see
one
of
you
I
will
not
take
action
against
you
now.
This
is
the
first
day
here
and
there
has
on
both
sides.
Hey!
Get
out!
Don't
shoot!
You
fool!
To
cross
the
wire
is
death!
-
What
wire?
It's
absolutely
forbidden
to
cross
it.
But
my
baseball
rolled
over
there.
-
You
first
ask
permission.
-
Gettin'
my
baseball.
-
OK.
Out
of
the
way.
Out.
What
are
you
doing
Like
I
told
Max,
I
was
trying
to
get
my...
-
What
were
you
doing
by
the
wire?
I
was
trying
to
cut
my
way
through
Do
you
speak
German?
Wire
cutters.
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
quite
And
I
flatter
myself
You
are
the
first

Hilts,

17

I

Unfortunately,
So
we
are
both
grounded
Well,
you
speak
for
yourself,
Colonel.
-
You
have
other
plans?
I
plan
on
doing
so
before
the
war's
over.
Are
all
American
officers
so
ill-mannered?
About
99
per
cent.
Perhaps
while
you
are
with
us,
10
days
isolation,
Hilts.
-
Captain
Hilts.
Right.
Oh,
you'll
still
be
here
when
I
get
out?
Cooler.
-
Name?
Flying
Officer
Ives.
Cooler.
20
days.
-
Cooler,
Ives.
-
Hilts.
What
did
you
do
in
the
States?
No,
I
was
in
college.
-
Say,
Ives.
-
How
many
escapes
have
you
tried?
-
Tunnel
man,
huh?
How
tall
are
you,
Ives?
Five
feet
four.
Why?
Oh,
just
wondering.
What
did
you
do
in
college?
Chemical
engineering.
Bicycles?
Motorcycles.
Flat
tracks,
county
fairs.
-
Helped
pay
my
tuition.
-
In
Scotland.
No,
horse
racing.
Jockey.
Jockey.
Jockey.
Hilts?
Are
you
there,
Hilts?
Yeah,
I'm
here.
Don't
you
have
them
in
the
States?
Sure.
They
were
the
days.
Saturday
nights
You
had
to
fight
off
the
birds.
You
know,
birds.
Girls,
man.
Girls.
Do
you
not
have
them
in
the
States?
Hilts?
Are
you
there,
Hilts?
Ives.
What?
You
know
the
kind
of
clay
and
gravel
How
many
feet
do
you
think
I
could
go
through
this
dirt
here
But
you
know
it's
not
the
digging.
and
getting
the
dirt
out
-
No,
it
isn't,
Ives.
How
are
you
going
to
get
the
dirt
out?
-
What
do
they
call
a
mole
in
Scotland?
Aye.
Well,
what
do
you
think?
I
must
say,
I'd
say
we
made
fools
of
ourselves.
As
the
sergeant
out
there
says,
Eric.
Don't
take
too
much
notice.
-
I'll
pass
the
word.
He
has
arrived.
The

Eric.
-
They
dumped
you

too.
Well,
it's
new.
Here.
Let's
find
you
a
bed.
Thanks.
Come
in.
-
Hello,
Roger.
-
I'll
put
your
bag
in
your
room.
-
How
are
you?
The
fellows
wanted
to
put
up
-
I
saw
Willie
and
Willinski
with
Mac.
-
How
long
have
you
been
here,
sir?
New
camp,
expert
guards,
the
elite.
You
met
the
commandant?
Yes,
I
did.
What
were
the
Gestapo
They
wanted
to
find
out
Who
else
is
here?
Cavendish?
-
Nimmo
and
Sorren?

Almost
the
whole

Almost.
They

As
Von
Luger
put
it:
There's
madness
in
their

What
about
Tommy
Bristol?
No,
but
there's
an
American
-
Hendley.
Is
he
a
scrounger,
blackmailer?
-
MacDonald
says
he's
the
best.
Last
of
the
tea
until
I
scrounged
this
from
Sedgwick.
Did
the
Gestapo
give
you
a
rough
time?
Not
nearly
as
rough
Roger,
personal
revenge
must
be
Too
many
lives
are
at
stake.
What
my
personal
feelings
are
You
appointed
me
Big
X,
confound

confuse
the

That's
true.
I'm
gonna

a
terrible
stink
that

of

How?
By
putting
more
men
out
of
this
perfect
camp
of
theirs
Not
two
or
three
or
a
dozen,
but
200,
300.
-
Think
that's
possible?
The
goons
have
put
every
escape
artist
Have
you
thought
of
what
it
might
cost?
I've
thought
of
the
humiliation
knuckle
under
and
crawl.
Surely
you
don't
advocate
that,
I
have
to
point
out
No
matter
how
unsatisfactory
the
high
command
have
left
us
not
the
Gestapo
and
the
SS.
Look,
sir,
you
talk
about
then
the
SS
and
the
Gestapo.
To
me
they're
the
same.
There's
only
one
way
to
put
it,
sir.
They
are
the
common
enemies
of

As

Tonight.
Gentlemen,
no

you've
heard
the

Well,
that's
exactly
We're

directly
east
But
that's
over
300
feet,
Roger.
-
Did
you
make
a
survey,
Dennis?
-
I
make
it
just
over
335
feet.
Willie,
this
time
we'll
dig
straight
down
That'll
rule
out
any
question
All
right,
Roger,
I
did.
There'll
be
three.
We'll
call
them
Tom,
Dick
and
Harry.
Dick
goes
north
from
the
kitchen,
and
If
the
goons
find
one,
How
many
men
do
you
250.
There'll
be
no
half
measures
this
time.
And,
Griff,
we'll
need
outfits
for
the
lot.
-
250?
Yes,
but...
OK,
Roger.
Mac.
Maps,
blankets,
rations,
-
Timetables
for
every
train.
-
Sorry
I'm
late,
Roger.
We're
going
to
tunnel.
Splendid.
Willie,
you
and
Danny'll
be
tunnel
kings.
Sedgwick,
manufacturer.
Nimmo
and
Haynes,
diversions.
Mac,
Hendley.
We
haven't
met.
-
Scrounger?
Dennis,
maps
and
surveys.
Colin,
you'll
take
your
usual
job.
Eric,
Usual
places.
I
hadn't
anticipated
Roger,
who's
going
to
handle
You
are.
I
want
a
system
of
stooges
from

to

I
want
a

system
so
perfect
of
any
of
the
huts
in
which
we're
working,
Well,
I
don't
think
there's
much
point
I'll
meet
each
of
you
on
the
exercise
Nothing
else,
is
there,
Mac?
I
shouldn't
think
so,
Roger.
Oh,
hello.
My
name's
Blythe.
Hendley.
-
For
birds.
Oh,
not
hunting.
Watching.
Oh,
a
bird
watcher?
Yes,
that's
right.
I
suppose
you
have
Yes,
we
have
some.
Tea?
I
only
drank
tea
once,
in
the
hospital.
Where's
your
kit?
This
is
it.
The
rest
was
confiscated
The
goons
didn't
appreciate
Such
as.
-
You're
the
scrounger.
I'll
need
a
camera.
-
What
kind?
A
35mm
f2.8
with
a
focal-plane
shutter
All
right.
-
And
film,
of
course.
Oh,
Hendley.
I
need
a
pick.
Big
heavy
one.
-
Only
one?
I'm
afraid
this
tea's
pathetic.
I
must
have
used
these
It's
not
that
I
mind
so
much.
Tea
without
milk
is
so
uncivilised.
Yeah.
I'll
get
our
wood.
Close
up!
Close
up!
Close
up!
Close
up!
Close
up!

No

what
are
you

I'm
in

for
a
joyride

The

I

you
do
here?
I'm
the
forger.
Forgers
are
installing

-
Sedgwick?
-
Griffith.
109?
Right.
I'll
work
in
107.
For
now,
Danny,
Willie
I
want
to
take
a
chance
on
the
tunnels
We
will
need
timber
for
the
shafts
Hendley
figures
We
can
tear
up
1
5
and
move
the
men
The
rest
will
come
-
Is
Hendley
taking
care
of
this
himself?
He's
working
on
some
steel
Hey!
What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
Turn
the
water
off!
Get
your
hands
away!
Get
away!
Hey!
What
the
hell's
going
on
there?
Stop
this
nonsense!
Get
away!
Turn
the
water
off!
Somewhere!
In
the
stove,
we
keep
fire
burning
always.
-
Good.
-
We
need
new
ones.
-
Should
match
perfectly.
It's
going
to
be
a
bit
tricky,
Danny.
Not
when
you're
organised,
Mac.
-
We're
ready.
It's
perfect.
Right
through
Good
luck
to
us,
Danny.
Why
17?
This
is
the
17th

Danny's
started.
All
right?
It's
good.
It's
very
good.
Get
out!
Get
out!
You're
not
in
your
hut?
Mopping
up.
-
And
you?
I'm
watching
him.
I'm
a
lifeguard.
Put
on
warm
clothes.
No.
I
vote
no.
Look,
we've
put
But
just
one
little
thing
like
this
-
Ives,
sit
down,
won't
you?
Hello.
Squadron
Leader
Bartlett,
Flight
Lieutenant
MacDonald.
I
understand
you
two
Where'd
you
hear
that...
sir?
MacDonald.
It's
Mac's
job
We
thought
perhaps
we
might
talk
it
over.
Why?
It's
only
a
two-man
job.
Everybody
in
the
camp
is
supposed
to
with
Squadron
Leader
Bartlett
here.
We
don't
necessarily
want
to
interfere.
It's
just
that...
well,
what
sort
of
blitz
We
sneak
out
at
night
to
a
spot
Then
we
dig
down,
take
the
dirt,
and
then
straight
out.
Ives
here
is
a
tunnel
man,
so
he
digs
I
stash
it
behind
me,
then
we
burrow
By
dawn
we're
under
the
wire,
across
Well...
When
do
you
intend
to
try
this?
-
When
do
you
intend
to
try
it?
Hilts,
this
may
not
be
quite
Look,
sir,
I've
been
in
the
bag
bloody
close
to
being
wire-happy.
It's
a
blitz-out
for
me,
or
forget
it.
It'll
work.
I
know
it
will.
Good
luck.
Thank
you.
-
Hilts,
um...
how
do
you
breathe?
We
shove
it
up
and
make
air
holes
Good
night,
sir.
Now,
why
didn't
anybody
It's
so
stupid,
it's
positively
brilliant.
But
it'll
bring
every
goon
I
don't
know.
If
we
stop
all
the
breakouts,
it
may
only
convince
the
goons
I
hope
it
works.
If
it
doesn't,
they're
going
-
Good,
huh?
-
This
is
the
dirt
from
the
compound.
Wherever
we
put
it,
Maybe
we
could
put
it
under
the
huts.
It's
the
first
place
the
ferrets
would
look.
Maybe
we
could
dry
it
to
the
same
colour.
-
There
are
50
tons
of
it.
If
you
must
think,
Where
the
devil
is
Ashley-Pitt?
We
can't
destroy
the
dirt
The
only
thing
left
to
do
is
camouflage
it.
That's
as
far
as
my
thinking
takes
me.
Didn't
they
teach
you
You'll
never
believe
it,
The
problem
is
somehow
to
get
rid
of
Well,
of
course.
Would
you
mind?
Now...
you
fill
these
bags
Then,
wearing
them
inside
your
trousers,
you
wander
out
into
the
compound
where
you
pull
these
Out
come
the
pins.
-
Eric,
it's
good.
Unless
you're
a
fool,
It's
indecently
brilliant.
-
We'll
try
it
first
thing
tomorrow.
Mac,
this
is
what
we'll
do.
-
A
little
present
from
Tom,
sir.
Nice
garden
you've
got,
sir.
All
right.
Let's
look
sharp.
That
looks
sharp.
Sir.
Please,
gentlemen,
continue.
-
Good
morning,
Squadron
Leader.
I
am
sorry
the
soil
here
isn't
We'll
manage,
sir.
I
must
say
I
am
surprised
with
-
Pleased,
of
course,
but
surprised.
Fliers
are
gentlemen,
not
peasants
The
English
are
keen
on
gardening.
Oh,
yes,
but
flowers.
Is
this
not
so?
You
can't
eat
flowers,
Colonel.
Good
point.
I
have
the
nasty
feeling
-
Maybe
he
does.
If
he
does,
we'll
find
out
soon
enough.
-
Morning,
Bob.
Here
we
are.
Now,
let's
see.
Biscuits,
two
packets.
Coffee,
two
tins.
Bovril,
one
jar.
Cigarettes,
six
packets.
Strawberry
jam,
Sorren's.
And
marmalade,
mine.
Danish
butter,
Von
Luger's.
Oh,
yes.
And
Dutch
chocolate.
Two
bars.
That
cleans
out
the
gift
food
Now,
the
first
thing
we
need
The
forgers
have
no
idea
I'll
see
what
I
can
do.
And,
of
course,
any
other
documents
you
can
put
your
hands
on.
-
Anyway,
put
'em
to
work,
Bob.
Good
luck.
O
come
all
ye
faithful
Joyful
and
triumphant
O
come
ye
O
come
ye
to
Bethlehem
Come
and
behold
Him
Born
the
King
of
Angels
O
come
let
us
adore
Him
O
come
let
us
adore
Him
O
come
let
us
adore
Him
Louis,
where
the
hell
is
the
air
pump?
Patience
is
a
virtue,
Roger.
Yes,
I
know,
but
the
diggers
and
this
is
holding
us
up
very
badly.
-
Is
it
finished?
-
Why
isn't
it
in?
-
Well,
when
will
they
be
finished?
-
Does
it
work?
-
Will
it
give
us
enough
air?
Mac.
Excellent.
Have
it
in
by
tomorrow
night.
Christ
the
Lord
-
Got
a
light?
Thanks.
-
It's
pretty,
isn't
it?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Would
you
like
one?
I'll
smoke
it
later
when
I'm
off
duty.
You
probably
have
-
Beautiful
day.
No,
no.
Red
sky
in
the
morning,
Red
sky
at
night,
sailor's
delight.
It
was
a
red
sky
last
night.
I
never
heard
that
before.
I
learned
it
in
the
Boy
Scouts.
-
You
were
a
Boy
Scout?
So
was
l.
-
Yes.
I
had
19
merit
badges.
I
was
working
on
my
20th
when
and
sent
me
into
the
Hitler
Youth
instead.
Werner,
you
think
you'll
stay
No.
I'm
not
a
well
man.
-
And
my
teeth...
Yes.
I
could
tell
you
that
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end.
Our
dentist
here
is
a
butcher.
But
don't
tell
anyone
I
said
so.
It's
a
soldier's
right
to
complain.
Maybe
in
your
army,
but
here?
One
little
criticism,
Is
that
so?
Terrible.
That's
terrible.
Werner.
Why
don't
we
go
into
my
room?
I'd
better
not.
I
was
just
gonna
make
some
coffee.
Real
coffee.
Coffee,
coffee,
coffee.
Where
is
it?
My
grandmother
keeps
Oh,
yeah.
Here.
Take
one.
Yeah.
Keep
it.
Nein.
I
must
go.
It's
OK.
You
can
keep
it.
We're
friends.
With
you
in
the
cooler,
I
don't
understand
you.
Report
what?
-
I
must
go.
I'll
never
be
able
to
eat
it
all.
I'm
sorry.
All
right.
Forget
it.
Forget
it.
And
that,
I'm
sure
you'll
all
remember,
Let's
turn
our
attention
to
this
gentleman
-
Lanius
nubicus.
The
butcherbird.
The
shrike
impales
his
foes
Not
a
very
lovable
character,
you
see.
Uniform
black
above,
from
head
to
tail.
A
black
rump,
a
black
crown
with
a
bold
The
shrike
lives
Ah.
Hendley.
Sit
down.
You'll
find
The
shrike
lives
in
lightly
wooded
Well,
Hendley,
have
you
Yeah.
Stick
around.
I
have
better
things
to
do
than
draw
birds.
The
voice
is
a
monotonous
succession
Now,
let's
have
a
good
look
at
this
bird.
An
Urlaubsschein.
Permission
to
Which
one's
the
forgery?
-
That
one.
They
both
are.
What's
holding
us
up
now
is
-
We've
no
idea
what
they
look
like.
And
a
military
identity
card.
And
a...
-
An
Ausweis.
-
Permission
to
be
on
Reich
property.
What
appears
to
be
the
ferret
You
get
10
out
of
10
for
this,
old
boy.
-
Thank
you,
sir.
Take
good
care
of
that.
It's
on
loan.
In
order
to
get
I
suggest
that
we
work
I
can
do
double-breasteds,
and
rather
nice
lounge
suits.
Lapels.
I
can
do
quite
a
lot
I
can
have
them
deep
like
that
Here's
one
that
Oh,
yes.
What
about
buttons?
Take
a
look
at
those.
And
here's
one
that
I
dyed
It's
rather
good.
What's
up,
Roger?
The
goons'd
have
a
field
day
That's
Sorren's
department.
Now,
I've
This
blanket.
Particularly
the
stripes.
Marvellous.
-
Coats.
I've
got
the
chaps
working
on
these
Those
battle
dresses
-
I'll
have
to
get
the
chaps
to
make
those
Blanket
ticking.
Now,
I've
made
these
into
-
Very
dapper,
yes.
Dyed,
of
course.
Just
take
a
look
at
this,
Roger.
Now,
this
blanket
material,
we
scrape
and
then
dye
it
with
boot
polish.
Corduroy
scrounged
by
Hendley.
-
Where
in
God's
name
did
you
get
these?
-
Where
did
he
get
them?
-
What
did
he
say?
Let
me
show
you
some
of
the
overcoats
Good
morning,
Hilts.
Well,
if
you're
here
to
find
out
-
When?
-
Dark
of
the
moon.
Is
Ives
going
with
you?
Yeah,
if
he
wants
to.
You
know
that
Ives
is
close
to
cracking?
Yeah.
-
Better
for
him
to
go
out
in
the
tunnel?
Right.
It's
possible
for
one
man
to
get
out
but
there
are
in
fact
a
considerable
in
this
camp
who
are
trying
to
escape.
I
appreciate
that.
Something's
coming
-
I
can
feel
it
-
and
it's
coming
right
around
the
corner
-
My
name's
Roger.
Yours
is
Virgil,
isn't
it?
Hilts.
Just
make
it
Hilts.
Yes,
well,
as
I
was
saying,
Hilts,
we
have
maps
of
Germany
-
We
have
all
the
information
we
need
But
what
we
do
not
have...
Is
a
clear
idea
of
what's
500
yards
We've
tried
every
goon
in
the
camp.
We
must
know
the
exact
position
We
want
to
know
where
Where
the
police
stations
are,
And
most
important
of
all,
to
the
railway
station.
No.
Absolutely
not.
I'm
not
gonna
be
I'm
gonna
be
so
far
away,
you
won't
hear
-
Understandable.
I
mean,
I'd
like
to
help,
but...
Interesting
idea.
-
How
many
you
taking
out?
250?
Yeah.
You're
crazy.
You
too.
250
guys
just
walking
down
the
road,
Well,
some
on
the
road,
some
by
train,
They'll
have
forged
papers,
clothes,
maps,
compasses,
rations.
You're
gonna
alert
Anybody
that
can
carry
a
pitchfork
They're
gonna
swoop
down
and
scoop
Yes,
well,
thanks,
anyway.
-
If
I
can
help
on
the
tunnel,
let
me
know.
Any
time.
Wait
a
minute.
You
aren't
seriously
and
case
everything
out
there
to
turn
myself
in
so
you
can
get
the
information
you
need?
Yes.
One
has
to
ask
some
very
-
We'll
give
you
a
front
place.
-
I
don't
blame
you.
-
It's
completely
understandable.
Yes,
well,
thanks,
Hilts.
Check.
Herr
Hendley,
l...
Oh,
it's
all
right.
Blythe's
a
friend.
-
What's
the
matter,
Werner?
Gone.
I
lost
them.
Everything.
He
lost
his
wallet.
Do
you
realise
what
would
happen
-
The
Russian
front.
I've
looked
every
place,
every
place.
I
must
have
lost
them
while
I
was
in
here.
-
No.
Look,
I
told
you
we
were
friends.
Oh,
thank
you,
Herr
Hendley.
Werner.
Not
now.
It
might
look
a
little
peculiar
if
you
and
I
were
seen
Look,
I'll
find
them.
I
promise
you
I'll
-
Thank
you.
-
Werner.
There
is
one
small
favour.
A
camera.
We
want
to
take
some
snapshots.
35mm
with
a
2.8
lens
and
a
plane
shutter.
Focal-plane
shutter.
Werner,
that's
a
focal-plane
shutter.
Let
me
know
when
you
got
it.
He's
a
crazy,
mixed-up
kid,
Checkmate.
How
soon's
our
air
pump
-
I'll
have
it
for
you
tomorrow.
-
How's
it
coming,
Danny?
-
No
good?
Willie,
you
all
right?
Pull!
You're
gonna
have
to
shore
up
the
whole
Four
times
today.
This
way
we
never
get
through.
It's
a
lot
of
timber,
Roger.
Can
you
get
it?
We'll
get
it.
We've
gotta
get
it.
I'll
put
Hendley
on
it,
OK,
Willie.
On
the
first
day
of

Stay

Say,
Cavendish...
Three
French
hens,
two
turtle
doves
And
a
partridge
in
a
pear...
Allez
hup!
Never
mind.
Here's
a
present
from
our
friend
Werner.
Splendid.
Simply
splendid.
This
should
do
very
nicely.
Those
are
Ashley-Pitt's
men.
He
requested
permission
to
dispose
Tom
has
reached
just
beyond
-
Harry,
of
course,
isn't
as
far
as
that.
We
make
it
50
feet,
sir.
-
Dark
of
the
moon
is
the
7th...
A
day
earlier
in
August.
Morning.
There
he
goes
again.
Why
is
he
buying
up
all
I've
been
working
on
that,
Hilts
and
Hendley
Sometimes
Goff's
with
them.
Mac,
we'll
close
down
Dick
and
Harry.
Put
the
entire
effort
into
Tom
Right,
Roger.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
About
face!
Forward
march!
-
What
is
it?
It's
the
4th
of
July.
What
the
devil's
this?
Gentlemen,
you're
invited
for
free
drinks.
-
A
little
present
from
the
colonials.
-
Quite
right
too.
And
to
getting
home.
Very
well.
We
accept.
-
Up
the
rebels!
Gentlemen,
follow
us.
About
face!
Company,
halt!
All
right,
let's
line
up
down
here!
All
right,
grab
a
cup!
Line
it
up!
Here
we
go.
That
explains
what
happened
No
harm
in
closing
down
Tom
I
suppose
it'll
do
us
all
good
There's
only
14
feet
to
go,
sir,
and
you
-
I
think
that
calls
for
a
drink.
-
Drink
it
up!
Moonshine.
Make
my
moustache
grow.
Cheers.
Keep
it
moving.
Hello,
Eric.
Don't
spill
any
of
that.
-
There
you
go.
All
right,
old
cobber.
Keep
it
mo...
-
Don't
get
any
on
your
clothes.
-
Don't
spill
any
of
that.
Keep
it
moving.
Don't
get
any
on
your
clothes,
sir.
American
moonshine.
No
smoking.
Get
good
and
stoned,
my
friend.
Keep
it
going.
Keep
it...
No
taxation
without
representation.
Keep
it
going,
boys.
Keep
it...
Keep
it
going,
fellas.
Enjoy
yourselves.
Well,
let's
drink
to
Tom.
To
Tom.
In
the
three
years,
seven
months
that's
the
most
extraordinary
-
It's
shattering.
Well,
with
your
permission,
sir,
Call
on
Ives.
Cheers,
Hendley!
You
know
what
that
is?
I'll
tell
you
what
it
isn't.
It
isn't
Napoleon
brandy.
How
do
you
like
it,
sir?
Well,
it's...
To
the
colonies.
Independence.
How
are
you
managing
over
there
without
We
seem
to
be
getting
along
all
right,
Yes,
well,
it's...
It's
good
stuff,
Hilts.
Thank
you,
sir.
Danny!
Here's
to...
Roger,
goons
in
105.
-
Who?
We
have
to
ignore
it.
If
we
pay
attention,
Here's
to
going
home.
Come
on,
Danny.
Home!
Anyway,
I'm
glad
we've
got
you
Och,
never
mind.
You'll
be
walking
down
To
Tom.
You
know,
Sandy,
Why
shouldn't
you,
man?
We're
nearly
at
the
trees,
eh?
Herr
Hauptfeldwebel!
Herr
Hauptfeldwebel!
Oh,
my
God!
They've
found
Tom.
It's
the
tunnel.
Success.
Ives!
Sir,
let
me
know
-
I'm
going
out
tonight.
Open
up
Harry.
We
dig.
Around
the
clock.
-
Cooler.
Well,
I
didn't
think
He
wasn't
caught.
Hilts,
welcome
home.
Danny?
Danny?
Danny?
Are
you
all
right,
Danny?
Yes.
All
right.
All
right.
Bring
some
shovels.
I'm
all
right.
For
God's
sake,
That's
impossible.
Yes.
Four
days'
work
up
the
bloody
spout!
I'm
sorry,
Colin.
It's
all
right,
Smithy.
It's
getting
late.
All
right.
-
Good
night,
Colin.
I
can't
see
a
bloody
thing.
-
Your
German's
very
good.
Watch
it.
That's
the
easiest
way
to
trip
up
-
I'm
sorry,
Mac.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five.
Roger.
No,
it's
me.
How
do
you
like
the
old
escape
suit?
Fine,
fine.
Colin.
How
do
you
like
mine?
It
looks
splendid.
Where
are
you
going?
-
What's
the
matter
with
you?
Danny,
we're
getting
out
through
Please,
Willie,
let
me
alone.
I
can't
go
in
that
tunnel
any
more.
So
I'm
going
out
through
the
wire.
Danny,
think.
We're
getting
out,
We're
getting
out
through
the
tunnel.
-
I
go
out
now.
Danny,
you
go
through
that
wire
Don't
do
that.
Willie...
Since
I
was
a
boy,
I
hate
and
feared
little
rooms,
closets,
caves.
Danny,
you've
dug
17
tunnels.
Because
I
must
get
out.
I
hide
the
fear,
and
I
dig.
But
tomorrow
night
in
the
tunnel
I'm
afraid
maybe
this
time
and
ruin
the
escape
for
everybody.
So
I
go
now.
Danny,
I'll
see
you
through
the
tunnel.
I'll
look
after
you.
All
right.
-
Good
evening.
Well,
how
do
you
think
we
look?
It's
as
bad
as
all
that?
Colin,
I
want
first
of
all
to
say
that
without
That's
all
right.
I
had
lots
of
help.
What's
the
matter,
Roger?
You
can't
go.
-
What
do
you
mean?
Why?
You
can't
see
your
hand
You'd
be
caught
before
you
got
10
yards.
That's
ridiculous.
That's
ridiculous.
Never
heard
I
can
see
perfectly.
I
can
see
perfectly!
I
can
see...
that
pin
down
there.
-
Does
that
satisfy
you?
Colin,
do
you
see
the
foot
of
the
door?
Yes,
of
course.
Put
the
pin
down
there,
will
you?
All
right.
All
right.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Sit
down.
Sit
down.
It
was
a
good
try.
I
hate
these
last-minute
letdowns,
-
It's
too
risky
for
you.
-
No,
I
don't.
We
all
know
the
score
here.
Your
idea
of
this
escape
to
foul
up
the
Germans
behind
the
lines.
But
once
we
get
past
that
wire
and
have
that
mission
is
accomplished.
Afterwards,
we
have
You
mean
getting
home?
-
Back
to
your
family?
Do
you
really
believe
I'm
sure
you
have.
I
know
Colin
has.
And,
Roger,
I
have
too.
We
think
we
can
make
it
all
the
way.
Not
Colin.
He'd
be
an
appalling
hazard
Let's
talk
about
hazard.
You're
the
biggest
hazard
we
have.
No
one
has
said
you
can't
go.
That's
true.
I
have
thought
about
the
Gestapo.
But
if
you're
asking
me
how
far
or
dare
go,
or
should
be
permitted
to
play
God,
I
can't
answer
you.
But
I
can
tell
you
a
blind
man
is
an
unnecessary
hazard
and
must
therefore
be
Colin's
not
a
blind
man
as
long
It's
all
right
with
you,
Colin?
Oh,
yes.
Quite.
Very
well.
I'll
arrange
for
your
escape
Good
night,
gentlemen.
Actually...
he's
quite
right.
He's
completely
right.
I
really
shouldn't
go
at
all.
My
eyes
have
been
getting
I
think
they
call
it
progressive
myopia.
I
can
see
things
up
here.
Close
to.
I
can
see
to
work,
but...
you're
just
a
blur.
I
know.
Oh,
hell.
We'll
make
it
in
great
shape.
Colin,
do
you
have
any
tea?
-
Yes,
of
course.
Splendid.
Hi,
Hilts.
Hey,
Mac.
When?
Tonight.
We
thought
Me,
too.
Let's
get
at
it.
-
Bartlett's
waiting
for
you.
What
time?
Only
eight
minutes
now,
Danny.
You
OK?
Cavendish.
Griff,
down
there.
Goff,
there.
Smith,
Foles,
third
on
the
right.
Blythe,
Hendley,
third
on
the
left.
There
are
the
lights.
Right
on
the
tick,
Danny.
Look
down
the
tunnel,
Danny.
It's
lovely.
It's
just
like
Blackpool
You
ever
been
to
Blackpool,
Danny?
Yes.
No.
I
don't
know.
It's
time,
Roger.
Bartlett,
MacDonald,
Ashley-Pitt.
It's
all
clear,
sir.
All
set,
Roger.
Roger.
Good
luck.
They're
coming
down
And
then
they'll
be
coming
Willie...
I
can't
wait.
I
must
get
out.
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
What
is
it,
Danny?
What's
the
matter?
Roger?
Danny
and
I'll
go
later.
Danny,
tell
me
what
this
is
This
tunnel
is
mine
as
much
as
anybody.
I
was
buried
many
times.
Let
me
out.
Let
me
out.
Take
him
out,
Willie.
Take
him
out.
Danny?
What
is
it?
Danny,
what's
going
on?
It's
all
right,
Sedgwick.
Danny,
it's
all
right.
It's
all
right.
We
can
take
another
place
in
the
line.
All
right,
Colin.
Down
you
go.
Sit
down.
Feel
the
top
rung
of
Down
you
go.
Danny
cut
out,
huh?
Willie
took
him
up
top.
Hilts,
l...
-
Remember,
keep
your
head
down.
Right.
Bartlett.
All
right?
-
Hold
on
to
yourself.
You're
20
feet
short.
20
feet
short
of
the
woods.
The
guard
is
between
us
and
the
lights.
How
could
that
happen?
What
the
hell
difference
does
it
make?
-
Roger...
We
could
postpone
it.
All
the
documents
are
dated
today.
One
chance.
When
the
guard
goes
to
the
I
think
I
can
make
it
to
the
woods,
What
about
the
towers?
They're
gonna
be
watching
Mac,
pass
the
word.
Send
down
30
feet
of
rope!
Send
down
30
feet
of
rope.
Send
down
30
feet
of
rope!
-
What?
-
What
do
they
want
that
for?
-
How's
it
going?
Have
you
heard?
-
Haven't
they
moved
into
the
tunnel
yet?
He's
over
there.
Right.
You
go
first,
Eric.
I'm
staying
here
till
we
get
moving.
-
See
you
in
Piccadilly.
Right.
Thank
you.
-
Good
luck.
We're
moving.
Danny,
they're
moving
through
When
Warsaw
fell,
you
escaped
and
You
came
because
you
wanted
to
fly
We
can
get
out
now.
If
you
don't
go
through
that
tunnel,
everything
you've
done
-
Blythe's
behind,
Mac.
In
here,
Colin.
Sit
down.
You're
up,
Sedgwick.
I'll
take
over.
-
What
have
you
got
in
here?
A
piano?
-
You
won't
get
this
thing
through.
-
Was
that
Sedgwick
with
his
trunk?
I
wish
he
was
home
with
his
kangaroos.
-
We're
20
feet
short.
Hilts
is
on
the
other
end
As
soon
as
you
feel
a
couple
of
tugs,
-
Good
luck,
Colin.
What's
that?
-
It's
an
air
raid.
The
goons'll
pull
the
switches.
Come
on,
Colin.
We
can
get
out
Willie.
Willie!
It's
an
air
raid.
Get
'em
out.
-
It's
gonna
give!
Danny.
Danny,
it's
all
right.
Light
the
lamps
down
there!
There's
been
an
air
raid
Danny,
it's
all
right.
Listen
to
me!
Danny,
look.
Come
on,
fellas.
Move!
Move!
What
the
hell's
going
on?
-
You
go.
Go.
-
What
is
this,
Willie?
-
Is
he
stuck
in
there?
Get
him
out
fast.
Come
on.
Come
on,
Danny,
move.
Up
you
go.
Give
me
your
bag.
We're
on
the
rope!
You
and
I
had
better
get
out,
or
we
won't
It's
moving.
We'll
just
have
to
pass
-
Right.
Come
on,
come
on.
Come
on.
-
Hey!
Don't
shoot!
Don't
shoot!
Get
off!
We're
coming
back!
Oh,
boy.
There's
a
hell
of
a
lot
Think
they've
been
shooting
them
We
would've
heard
the
shots
before.
Pull!
Wait
for
me.
Out.
Out.
-
How
many
did
he
say?
76.
-
76.
-
Dismissed.
Half
the
guys
who
missed
Ashley-Pitt,
Roger,
MacDonald,
Nimmo.
Makes
quite
a
group.
-
What
do
we
do?
Tallyho.
Tallyho.
-
Are
the
police
on
the
train?
All
right.
-
I'll
tell
you
when.
-
Are
you
all
right?
That's
quite
exciting.
-
It
isn't
stopping.
Switzerland.
Hey!
Bartlett.
-
Where
were
you
going,
Cavendish?
What
information
were
you
None.
What
sabotage
directions
What
have
you
done
with
your
papers?
-
Papers?
Don't
be
so
stupid.
All
I
did
was
escape
from
a
prison
camp.
You'd
do
the
same
if
you'd
been
-
I
wanted
to
get
home.
You've
got
the
wrong
man.
You're
wearing
civilian
clothes.
You're
a
spy.
Spies
are
being
shot.
This
is
my
uniform.
I
dyed
it
with
boot
polish
I
picked
up
when
I
was
shot
down.
And
you
lost
your
insignia
That's
right.
-
Look...
Hello,
boys.
Hello.
-
Hello,
Haynes.
I
wish
I
could
say
I
was
happy
-
Just
picked
up?
There's
a
trainer
out
there
I
can
fly.
-
Any
sentries?
Colin,
when
I
say
go,
When
the
engine
catches,
don't
move,
Go!
Next
stop,
Switzerland!
The
Alps.
Splendid.
Over
this
range,
then
20
more
minutes
-
What
is
it?
Petrol?
Go
that
way!
I'll
follow.
Hendley?
Colin!
Stop!
Don't
shoot!
Please!
Colin,
I'm
sorry
I
fouled
things
up.
That's
all
right.
Thank
you
for...
getting
me
out.
Caf
Suzette.
Hello?
Hello?
Resistance.
Resistance?
You
are
English?
I'm
Australian.
-
You
can
speak
English.
I
understand.
I've
just
escaped
from
I'm
trying
to
make
my
way
into
Spain.
Can
you
help
me?
-
I
know
someone
who
can.
Good
luck.
Thank
you.
You
are
English.
Herr
Bartlett?
Your
German
is
good.
And
I
hear
also
your
French.
Your
arms...
up!
Herr
Bartlett.
And
Herr
MacDonald.
We
are
together
again.
You
are
going
to
wish
-
What's
troubling
you,
Roger?
I
expected
either
a
long
stay
Yes.
I
have
to
admit,
I
hope
to
God
I
haven't
Och,
no,
no.
We're
all
over
21
,
We'd
never
have
got
as
far
For
what
it's
worth,
-
I
think
we
all
do.
All
right.
You
can
get
out
now.
It
will
take
hours
You
know,
Mac,
all
this
-
the
organisation,
kept
me
alive.
And
even
though
we...
I've
never
been
happier.
You
know,
Mac...
1
1
of
your
men
are
being
returned
today.
Oh,
who?
I
do
not
have
that
information.
I...
I
am
directed
by
a
higher
authority
50
of
your
officers
Shot?
Their...
personal
effects
will
be
returned.
How
many
of
them
were
wounded?
Here
are
the
names...
of
the
dead.
How
many
of
the
50
were
wounded?
None.
They
-
the
higher
authority
-
only
directs
me
to
inform
you
that...
that
50
men
were...
I
see.
Addison,
John.
Alladale,
Peter.
Bancroft,
Edward.
Bartlett,
Roger.
Cavendish,
Dennis.
Eldridge,
David.
Felton,
William.
Fanshaw,
Arthur.
I
am
your
guide,
se?or.
Spain?
-
Glad
to
see
you're
all
safe.
-
How
many
have
been
brought
back?
-
Do
you
know
how
many
got
away?
What
happened
to
Blythe?
He
didn't
make
it,
sir.
Roger
was
right
about
that.
I'm
afraid
Roger
didn't
make
it,
either.
I've
just
posted
the
list.
They
shot...
50.
The
Gestapo
murdered
them.
50?
MacDonald,
Ashley-Pitt?
Yes.
Danny
and
Willie?
No,
they're
not
on
the
list.
-
Haynes?
I'm
sorry.
Roger's
idea
was
to
get
back
at
Mess
up
the
works.
From
what
we've
heard
here,
Do
you
think
it
was
worth
the
price?
That
depends
on
your
Yes,
sir.
He
is
not
to
be
saluted.
The
job
just
didn't
work
out,
huh?
-
You
were
lucky,
Hilts.
How
many?
50.
It
looks,
after
all,
as
if
Sir.
Hey,
Hilts!
