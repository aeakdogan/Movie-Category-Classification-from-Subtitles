Ifyoure
still
with
us,
They
are
hitting
the
centre
of
the
city.

..off
in
the
distance
Clearly
l
've
never
been
there,...
..but
this
feels
like


The
28
countries...
..with
forces
in
the
Gulf
area...
..have
exhausted
all
reasonable
efforts...
..to
reach
a
peaceful
resolution,...
..have
no
choice...
..but
to
drive
Saddam

The
mother
of
all
battles.

Our
objectives...
..in
the
Persian
Gulf
area
clear,...
..our
goals
defined.
Iraq
must
withdraw
from
Kuwait...
..completely,
immediately,...
..and
without
condition.

The
liberation
of
Kuwait...
..has
now
entered
a
fllnal
phase.
l
have
therefore
directed
..including
ground
forces,...
..to
eject
the
Iraqi
army
from
Kuwait.

..that
the
ground
war
is
only
hours
away.
Peter
Arnett,
Baghdad.
Don't
ever
for
one
minute
..but
remember,
we're
better
soldiers.
We're
fighting
with
better
equipment,
Sleep
deprivation.
..so
stay
on
top
of
'em.
Any
questions?
Let's
have
a
Little
prayer.
Dear
God,
protect
us...
..as
we
protect
our
country
Keep
us
safe
that
well
all
get
home
Amen.
Amen.

Find

Patella.

Identified.
Fire!

Got

We

Your

Liberty-6.

Troops!
Cease

Cease

Come

Come

Sabre-6,

Whoa!

Oh,

All
Sabre
units,
this
is
Sabre-6.
We
just
lost
a
tank.
-
I
didn't
see
anything.
Who
the
hell
is
shooting
at
us?
Liberty-6,
we
got
enemy
tanks...
..retreating
grid
7-6...
-
Patella,
that
one
of
our
tanks?
Make
it
out,
and
fast!
Oh,
shit!
We're
almost
browning
out.
Nat,
what's
happening?
Liberty-6,
we
got
enemy
tanks
on
our
flank.
This
is
Cougar-6.
Enemy
tangos
at
phase
line
delta.
Over.
-
Patella,
find
me
a

Do
you

I
think
so!
Gunner,
Sabot,

Identify!

Fire!
He

fired,
sir.
They're
firing
at
us!
-
Loader!
Fire!
Yeah!
That's
the
one!
All
right.

Sabre-6,
we
just
lost
Cougar-6.
-
We
got
him.
I
heard
you!
We...
what?
Oh,
my
God.
You
just
lit
up
Boylar,
goddamn
it!

Sabre-6,
Nat,
what's
happening?
Patella,
was
that
one
of
our
tanks?
He
fired,
sir.
At
us
or
at
the
T-72s?
I
don't
know.
At
us
or
at
the
T-72s?
I
don't
know!

Oh,
Jesus
fucking
Christ.

Colonel
Serling,
report
status
now.

They
have
range
on
us,
sir.
Sir!
Oh,
Christ,
Colonel...
I
gave
the
order
to
fire.
So
with
your
thermal
equipment,...
..confused
by
burning
tanks
..you
couldn't
tell
the
difference
I
believe
that,
uh,
we...
l
should
have
known
the
difference,...
..even
with
the
night
scope.
If
we
weren't
under
attack,...
But,
under
the
circumstances,
Under
the
circumstances,...
..I
suppose
there
was
There
was
no
way
to
tell
the
difference.
Thank
you,
Colonel.
That's
all
we
need.

Were
almost
browning
out!

We
got
enemy
tanks
on
our
flank.
Aah!
We
just
lost
Cougar-6!
You
just
lit
up
a
friendly!

Colonel
Serling?
Yes.
You
OK?
Can
I
get
you
something?
Yes,
I'm
fine.
Fine.
Uh,
yes,
you
can
get
me
a
cup
of
coffee.
You
got
it.
We
missed
you
and
Meredith
I'm
too
old
to
dance
with
you
youngsters.
Meredith's
not,
Oh,
OK.
I
willdo
just
that...
..next
time.

Colonel
Serling.
-
Hershberg
in
five.
Coffee's
coming.
Yes.
Washington
Post?
About?
Yes,
I
was
there.
That's
a
matter
of
public
record.
Well,
thank
you
very
much,
Mr...
Gartner.
Thank
you,
Mr
Gartner,
No,
sir.
No,
sir!
Well,
Ill
do
just
that.
Right.
Colonel
Serling's
here,
sir.
Ban.
I'm
not
talking
to
you.
You
and
Sylvia
have
been
together,
The
way
she
danced
with
that
marine,
It
may
be
my
last
anniversary
party.
Were
you
there
for
me?
What's
up?
Hey,
Nat.
I've
got
to
talk
to
you.
How
we
holding,
Ban?
Running
late,
sir.
-
May
I
run
a
few
things
by
you,
sir?
Lieutenant
Boylar's
parents...
Boylar?
Tom
Boylar.
He
died
in
AI
Bathra.
He'd
been
with
me
a
long
time.
-
From
Virginia,
right?
His
parents
have
written
to
me.
You
know
we
can't
discuss
it.
-
Yes,
sir,
but...
-
He's
a
hero.
That's
all
they
want
to
know.
We
got
a
call...
..from
the
Washington
Post.
A
reporter
named
Gartner.
A
reporter
called
you
about
AI
Bathra?
You
didn't
talk?
Of
course
not.
Nobody
ll
hang
you
out
to
dry.
Did
you
listen
to
the
tape,
sir?
Colonel,
the
war's
over.
You
and
I
have
been
given
..of
investigating
combat
medals
In
other
words,
we've
been
passed
over.
I
prefer
to
think
of
it
We
understand
each
other?
Yes,
sir.
OK.
The
White
House
heard
we're
considering
..who
saved
some
guys
-
Naturally
they
want
it
for
Veterans
Day.
Which
is
why
We've
got
the
rescued
soldiers
Attention.
Morning.
Take
your
seats.
Everything
in
order?
-
Just
going
over
the
sequence
of
events.
Morning,
sir.
Good
to
see
you
again.
Could
we
get
a
picture
No,
thank
you.
-
Keep
me
in
the
loop.
-
Morning.
Doug
Bruno,
White
House.
Nat
Serling.
Ill,
uh,
get
out
ofyour
way.
-
Major.
25
February,
Their
Blackhawk
was
shot
down
Five
seconds
after
it
locked
on,
-
We
didn't
know
what
hit
us.
..we
got
caught
in
a
pocket
of
resistance.
Iraqi
ground
troops
on
the
ridge
above
Did
you
discuss
surrendering?
Yes,
sir,
we
did.
We
were
all
wounded
one
way
or
another.
We
weren't
trained
Don't
have
to
make
excuses
to
me.
Go
on,
Sam.
That's
all
we
got
so
far,
sir.
OK.
-
Lieutenant
Chelli.
Well,
..one
oftheir
T-54s...
..joins
the
ragheads
up
on
the
ridge.

Incoming!
Get
down!
That
round
..and,
uh,
Egan
here
lost
his
leg.
So
we
figure
that's
it.
We're
dead.
But
then
we
hear
it.
Nothing
like
the
sound
of
an
inbound
Huey.

Yeah!
Yeah!

This
Huey,
didit
take
anyfire?
Right
offthe
bat.
But
this
time
Ground
troops
go
for
cover.
Then
the
Huey
circles
back
over
the
tank...
That's
when
-
Threw
something,
or
something
fell
off?
Oh!
Yeah!
Man,
did
it
ever
blow!
We,
uh,
we
never
did
see

We
couldn't
see
the
crash.
That
night
we
caught
sporadic
ground
fire.
The
Huey
was
down
below,
..so
they
caught
most
of
it.
Any
communications
No,
sir.
As
I
said,
our
radio
was
wasted.
Shouting
just
draws
enemy
fire.
So
the
Iraqis,
..under
cover
fire,...
..and
the
Huey
returns
fire.
We
figure
it's
all
over,
Cobras,
Hueys...
And
a
big-ass
A-10
Thunderbolt.
I
swear
I
never
heard
such
a
sweet
sound.
But
now
the
fuckers
are...
I'm
sorry,
sir.
The
Iraqis
are
letting
loose
with
all
they
got.
-
You
were
right
the
first
time.
Plus
the
Huey
crew
is
stillbanging
away.
We
load
our
wounded
aboard,...
..and
that's
when
I
guess
it
was
the
commander
ofthe
rescue.
Mm-hmm.
And
this...
Huey
crew,...
.they,
uh,
they
returned
fire
Yes,
sir.
I...
I
think
so.
I
couldn't
see
much,
though.
I
heard
it.
Nothing
else
sounds
like
an
M-16.
I
heard
it,
too.
The
last
thing
we
see
is
the
Thunderbolt
I
don't
know
if
it
was
Captain
Walden...
..but
that
Huey...
..saved
our
lives.
It
sure
sounds
like
it.
OK.
Thank
you
for
your
help.
Thank
you,
sir.
Thank
you,
Colonel.
Thatll
be
all.
-
Got
something
for
me?
Walden's
201
file.
Evaluation
reports.
You
know
I'm
going
to
need
Make
sure
we
don't
have
a
wife-beater
Thatll
blow
it.
About
this
Congressional
Medal
of
Honour.
It's
not
the
Congressional
Medal
of
Honour.
Tell
that
to
Congress.
If
Captain
Walden
wins
this
medal...
You
don't
win
it.
You,
uh,
receive
it.
It's
not
a
contest.
But
that
is
perfect.
That
is
why
I'm
here.
I'm
not
here
..take
these
facts
and
twist
them.
I
just
want
to
get
these
nuances
out
-
It's
a
woman.
What
did
you
think
the
hoopla
was
about?
Banacek's
got
information
-
The
crew
chief
we're
still
tracking.
She's
the
first
woman
ever
to
be
nominated
I
mean,
this
is
gold.
It's
gold.
Unfortunately
it's
posthumous,...
..but
I've
got
her
Little
daughter.
I
got
the
President
of
the
United
States.
It's
all
set
in
the
Rose
Garden.
The
President's
going
to
lean
down
and
There
is
not
going
to
be
Excuse
us.
OK,
it
was

to

..hook
shot.
Me
and
her
are
cheerleaders.
-
More
mashed
potatoes.
..but
how
about
some
bread?
Aah!

Aah!
Daddy,
can
I
have
your
mashed
potatoes?
Daddy?
Sir?
Can
I
have
your
mashed
potatoes?
M...
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah,...
..soldier.
You
want
'em
all?

That
enough?
More?
Hello?
Yes.
Uh,
who
is
calling,
please?
Just
a
minute.
It's
for
you.
Who
is
it?
Somebody
Gartner.
Want
some
more
peas?
Excuse
me.
Where
are
you
going?
Fort
Hood.
General
Hershberg's
got
me
investigating
It's
a
woman.
Good
for
her.
Posthumous.
Too
bad,
but
still
good
for
her.
Mmm.
Too
bad.
You
talk
to
the
investigators
today?
Right.
It's
all
right,
isn't
it,
Nat?
Yeah.
Fine.
How
long
are
you
gone
for?
Couple
of
days.
Then
why
are
you
emptying
I
may
be
gone
more
than
a
couple
of
days.
Nat.
Yes.
I
don't
know
what's
happening.
Everything's
fine.
I'm
handling
it.

Mr.
Rady,
That's
right.

Can
you
tell
me
I
remember
the
earth.
I
remember...
llario's
face.
I
wish...
-
She
hadn't
needed
to
be
a
hero
so
bad.
We
were
just
doing
our
job.
It's
not
Ren's
fault
I
got
hit.
She
sure
as
hell
saved
the
lives
-
You
always
defend
her.
She
was
so
butch.
Honey,
shut
up.
She
was,
you
know.
One
of
those
women
Annie,
shut
up.
She
gave
her
life
for
those
men.
She
was
a
soldier.
There
she
blows.

-
We're
taking
fire!
-
Kill
that
motherfucker,
Bonfires!
-
We
need
a
fucking
air
strike!
-
Making
another
pass,
Ran?
No!
We
should
go
for
altitude,
After
we
slow
down
that
tank!
-
How
we
gonna
do
that?
AItameyer,
Get
ready
to
push
it
overboard.
Push
it
overboard,
ma'am?
llario,
unhook
the
flare
gun!
What

fuck...
Do
it!
It's
a
bomb,
asshole!
Target

up!
Gimme

Ready

-
Got
it?
-
Tell
us
when
you're
there!
Hell

it!
-
The
pod
will
drop
at
the
same
velocity!
Pick
your
moment!
Now!

Oh,
my
God!
Oh!
Whoa!
Shit!
Whoa!
Oh,
God!
Hang
on,
llario!
Grab
a
hold
of
me!
Don't
let
go
of
me!
Pull
me
in!
Hang

Do
something!
No!
No!
Rady,

Oh,
my
God...
That's
it.
I
woke
up
three
days
later
Nearly
bought
it,
that's
sure.

When
did
you
decide

That
happened
about
l
could
have
gone
in
the
Air
Force.
l
stood
high
enough
in
my
class.
You
can't
get
away
from
that
guy.
-
Hell
of
a
soldier,
though.
I
know
so.
Really.
How?
I
was
with
him
in
the
Gulf.
No
shit.
-
Doing
what?
Hu-ah.
Hu-ah.
Once
upon
a
time,
-
With
who?
-
You
kicked
some
serious
butt.
-
One
for
my
friend...
Make
it
a
double
for
Colonel
Serling.
They
won't
find
any
criminal
culpability
You
got
nothing
to
worry
about.
Those
were
my
men.
I
put
that
badly.
I'm
sorry.
Look,
I
went
to
Virginia
You
what?
I'm
sorry,
but
they
got
a
right
Ill
take
that.


And
this
Huey
crew,
they,
uh,

Yes,
sir.
l
think
so.
l
couldn',t
see
much.

l
heard
it.
Not
know
A-K
or
M-60.

l
heard
it,
too.

Last
thing
we
see
..on
the
two
downed
choppers.

Oh!
Sir!
All
right,
this
is
antifungal
cream,...
..but
to
kill
the
athlete's
foot
when
That's
disgusting.
What've
you
got
for
me
today?
You
want
to
get
rid
of
the
allergies
to
Jesus.
I
give
up
coffee,

-
Morning,
Colonel.
How
many
do
you
want?
I
take
eight
every
day.
Four's
good.
-
I
need
to
talk
to
you,
Specialist.
I'm
investigating
the
recommendation
to
Rowtero?
Yeah?
Can
you
cover
for
me?
I'm
going
to
go
feed
the
cancer
genes.
Do
you
really
need
to,
uh,
I
mean...
It's
fine.
Uh,
what
do
you
want
to
know?
How
long
were
you
with
Captain
Walden?
Um...
over...
over
two
years.
Quite
a
long
time.
Yeah.
You
were
her
medic.
Yes,
sir.
I
don't
fly
any
more
though.
Well,
don't
miss
it,
do
you?
Never.
Never
again.
That's
quite
a
habit
you
got.
Yeah,
it's,
uh...
..one
of
the
few
things
I
can
call
my
own.

So...
..tell
me
what
happened
at
AI
Kufan.
See,
I'd,
uh...
..I'd
never
been
in...
in
combat.


Mayday!
Mayday!
This
is
Dustoff-3!
We're
going
down!


llario?
Yeah,
I'm

tank's
intact.

Enemy
at
the
back
door!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Monfriez,
get
that
saw
working!
Come
on!
Get
down!
I've
got
the
M-16!

llario?
He's
bad.
It's
the
lung.
We
gotta
get
him
out
of
here.
-
Head
wound?
Dead.
So's
the
ADT.
Monfriez,
easy
on
the
ammo!
We
might
be
here
a
while!
Captain!
You've
seen
me
do
this
a
million
times.
Ammo?
I
got
this
belt
and
three
more
boxes.
OK,
AItameyer,
We're
gonna
make
a
perimeter.
Monfriez,
cover
us!
Go!
Where's
our
Kevlar?
I
got
one!
Well,
put
it
on!
Unh.
How's
he
doing?
He's
the
same.
I
need
a
hook.
As
soon
as
it
gets
dark,
we
dig
in.
Then
we
wait.
For
what?
For
the
good
guys.

You
won't
think
it's
so
funny
Yeah,
they
were
laughing.
You
about,
uh...
You
done?
So
tell
me
what
happened...
..during
the
night.
You
were
there.
You
saw
the
nights.
You
know,
just...
it
was
black.
Just...
black.
Tell
me
what
happened
that
night.
Well,
she
put
us
on
two-hour
watches.
Um...
it's
not
like

You
OK,
Captain?
Shit
in
my
eye.
Will
our
guys
come
tonight?
Theyll
be
here.
Dust
is
blowing
pretty
bad.
I
don't
know
I
can
hear
the
rag
heads
Then
I'd
suggest
everybody
just...
They're
going
away.
It
was
just
a
probe.
llario?
I'm
OK.
AItameyer?
My
ear!
Monfriez?
I...
I
took
one.
-
Rady?
Unh...
Oh,
shit.
Stay
with
Rady.
I
like
to
come
here.
It's
not
just
the
bikinis,
It's
these
kids.
I
like
to
watch
them,
you
know?
My
folks
had
this
place
I
still
go
there
sometimes,
watch
'em
dive.
They
do
the
damnedest
things.
They
never
think
about
the
consequences.
Imagine
that.
Imagine
not
thinking
Imagine
that.
Are...
are
we
done?
After
the
attack...
..during
the
night...
What?
I
mean,
we
waited.
I...
I
still
don't...
-
I...
I
don't
know
what
you...
Well,
Karen,...
Ohh...
Unh...
Unh!
How
many
rounds
left?
Just
a
sec.
How
many
rounds?
I
just
opened
my
last
can
of
ammo.
Five
mags
for
the
M-16,...
..9-mll's
full.
Mine's
empty.
Fire
a
couple
of
rounds
off.
-
Let
'em
know
we're
still
allve.
Now
save
your
ammo
During
the
course
of
the
incident,
..when
she
had
to
make
No.
No.
Never.
She
just
made
'em.
Just
like
that?
Just
like
that.
Karen,...
the
captain...
she
had
this
quality.
The
heavier
the
pressure,
We
knew
they
were
out
there,...
..sneaking
up
on
us.
But
we
also
knew
I
don't
know
why
people
think
only
Incoming!
How
many?
100.
Maybe
more.
Any
good
at
hand-to-hand?
Wait
till
they
get
closer.
Make
every
round
count!
-
Shit!
What
in
Christ
for?
They
know
we're
here!
Quiet!
I
hear
something!

Choppers!
Hey!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Go!
Go!
Yeah!

Let's
get
out
of
here!
llario,
get
the
captain!
There's
the
rescue!
Help
Rady!
Pick
him
up!
Go!
Let's
go!
Let
go!
Let's
go!
Come
on!
Let's
move!
Move
it!
Gotta
go!
We
gotta
go!
Come
back
for
me
with
a
stretcher!
Go!
llario,
let's
get
the
fuck
outta
here!
Get
the
fuck
outta
here!
Aah!
Aah!
Medic!
Come
on!
Get
him
up!
Move!
Come
on!
Let's
go!
Where's
Walden?
Captain
Walden
is
dead.
Strike
leader,
this
is
Dustoff-6.
We
have
all
the
friends.
Roger,
Dustoff-6.
Going
on
down.
So...
Is
she
gonna
get
it?
Well,
I
sincerely
hope
so.
I
just...
I
don't
want
to
tell
that
story
again.
Not
one
more
time.
Yeah,
I
understand.
May
I
be
excused?
Yes,
you
can.
Oh,
one
more
thing
I'm
confused
about.
This
M-16...
What?
Did
it
run
out
of
ammo?
Uh,
what
did
I
say?
I
don't
remember.
That's
why
I'm
asking.
I
guess,
uh...
I
guess
it
ran
out
of
ammo
Um...
Or,
no,
sometime
during
the
night...
I
don't
know.
See,
the
Blackhawk
crew
..during
the
rescue
that
morning.
Did
they?
That's
right.
Must've
been
wrong,
then.
Them
or
you?
Who,
them
or
you?
Oh,
them.
Them,
yeah.
No,
they
must
have
been
wrong.
OK.
OK.
What
about
the
letter?
A
what?
You
and
Walden
traded
letters
to
send
home
Oh,
yeah.
Yes,
sir.
So,
who
was
hers
to?
Her
folks.
-
So
you
sent
it?
Her
folks,
they're
good
people.
They
got
a
farm
out
in
Abllene.
They'd
come
to
Hood,
look
after
her
kid
Yeah...
Yeah.
OK.
Thank
you,
Specialist.
Thank
you
very
much,
sir.
I
read
somewhere...
..that
if
a
child
doesn't
see
a
person
die,...
..or
dead,
like
in
a
casket,...
..that
the
person
isn't
really
dead
for
them.
That'd
be
nice,
wouldn't
it?
Yes,
ma'am.
It
was,
uh...
unusual,
wasn't
it,...
..for
Karen
to
want
to
be
a
helicopter
pilot?
I
guess
that's
my
fault.
I
took
her
to
the
fair
when
she
was
11.
12
-
7th
grade.
Anyway,
there
was
a
helicopter
there.
Small
one
with
a
bubble
up
front.
The
fella...
the
pilot
was
selling
rides.
I
bought
Karen
a
ticket.
It
was
a
short
ride.
But
when
she
came
down...
Well,
I
don't
think
She
showed
up
..just
after
she
finished
TCU.
She's
joined
the
Army.
She
wants
to
fly
helicopters.
She's
real
stubborn
about
it,
too.
That's
our
Karen,
you
know,
stubborn.
So's
Anne
Marie
here.
Come
here,
honey.
Excuse
me.
Uh,
the
young
men,...
..the
ones
that
came
to
tell
us
about
Karen...
..they
were
dressed
just
like
you.
Oh,
I
see.
Major
Teegarden,...
..her
commanding
officer,
he
came,
too,
Brought
this
photo
back
for
Anne
Marie.
Meant
a
lot
to
us...
..him
coming
to
see
us,...
..telling
us
in
person
how
Karen
died.
I
lost
men
over
there,
too.
I
spoke
to
the
major.
Everybody
thought
the
world
It
would
sure
help
if
I
could
see
her
letter.
I
mean,
if
it's
not
too
private.
Letter?
From
llario?
Ill
check
my
notes.
Must
be
my
mistake.
This
her
husband
here?
No.
That's
Karen's
older
brother
Billy.
Her
husband's
up
in
Michigan.
He
and
Karen
divorced
He
never...
well,...
it
was
no
picnic.
Karen
raised
Anne
Marie
on
her
own.
We'd
have
been
thrilled
..what
with
the
Army
and
all.
But
Karen
was
a
real
good
mom.
Never
asked
for
help
You
can't
imagine
how
hard
it
was
for
her...
..to
go
off
and
leave
that
Little
girl
..but
it
was
important
to
Karen
So
she
went.

You've
been
out
here
20
minutes
-
How
much
longer
before
that?
I
see
you,
uh...
..got
the
new
refrigerator.
Do
you
think
the
kids
will
understand
..instead
of
playing
with
them
Or
at
Fort
Hood,
Are
you
back?
I'm
in
transit.
You
know,
Nat,
it
took
me
a
long
time...
..to
figure
out
how
to
be
an
Army
wife
It
wasn't
easy,
but
I
did
it.
I
know
you
did,
Mer.
So
it
wouldn't
be
a
hardship
for
me...
..to
learn
how
not
to
be
an
Army
wife...
..if
my
husband
wasn't
in
the
Army
any
more.
The
Army's
my
life,
Mer.
And
so
are
we.
You
don't
have
to
figure
it
all
out,
Nat.
You
just
have
to
admit
that
you
can't.
You
have
to
want
to
be
here
with
us,...
..that's
all.
Well
be
here.
For
a
while.
Now
go
away.
If
you're
not
going
to
stay,
-

This
M-16,
did
it
run
out
of
ammo?

Yes,
sir?
-
Colonel
Serling,
you
can
go
in
now.
Hey,
Nat,
what's
up?
General.
It's
the
Walden
file,
sir.
Discrepancies?
Yes,
sir.
I
knew
those
White
House
clowns
-
If
she
doesn't
deserve
it,
she
won't
get
it.
It's
some
of
the
details
of
the
stories
-
I
don't
know
how
significant...
They're
crawling
all
over
my
ass
Sir,
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
this
is
Now,
this
specialist,
uh,
llario,
We're
not
giving
the
medal
to
llario.
Roger.
Splendid.
Move
forward.
OK.
The
discrepancies
specifically
Come
on,
Nat!
No
two
eyewitnesses
You
know
that
as
well
as
I
do.
When
do
we
get
that
report?
I
want
the
White
House
off
my
back.
A
few
days,
sir.
You
agree
that
this
report
should
be
Which
means
exactly
what,
Colonel?
Which
means
exactly
what
I
said,
sir.

Sorry,
sir.
This
is
the
second
copy
The
investigator
seemed
to
have
Rise
above.
This
will
all
be
over
soon.
Will
there
be
..when
the
investigation
is
over,
sir?
There's
been
a
decision
not
to
release
..has
been
thoroughly
reviewed.
Well,
how
long
do
you
imagine
I
mean,
next
time
I
see
Lieutenant
Boylar's
You
know
how
many
grieving
parents
This
is
not
Vietnam.
Lieutenant
Boylar's
tank
We're
the
only
country
We
got
reporters
from
the
Washington
Post
..and
the
only
person
that
knows
it
..because
these
investigators
Someone
has
got
to
be
Take
a
seat.
Nat,
I'm
going
to
give
you
First
you
imply
I'm
not
interested...
..in
an
accurate
report
on
Captain
Walden.
Now
you're
suggesting
there
must
be
So
how
do
you
want
me
to
respond?
As
your
commanding
officer,...
..or
as
your
friend
..and
fucking
burped
your
kids
Just
how
should
I
respond?
I'm
sorry,
sir.
I
should
hope
by
God
you
would
be.
Now,...
..losing
a
man
like
your
friend
Boylar,...
..I've
been
there.
Well,
this...
..whole
mess...
It's
my
ass
on
the
line
I
can
feel
the
chilling
the
air
Yes,
sir.
And
I
know
about
the
drinking.
And
if
I
have
to
write
you
up,...
..itll
just
be
one
more
bite
out
of
your
record.
Clean
it
up.
Get
yourself
in
a
programme.
Ill
be
looking
for
that
report.
Soon.
-

Yes,
this
is
the
Serling
residence.
-
But
at
the
tone,
leave
a
message
and...



You
better
get
your
head
into
this!
I'm
going
to
drop
you
You
better
hurry
up!
Morning,
sir.
Monfriez
is
over
there.
Thank
you.
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing,
soldier?
-
There,
sir.
You
see
that
man?
You
and
he
are
brothers.
You
never
leave
a
man
behind.
-
Yes,
Drill
Sergeant!

You
were
in
Panama?
Yes,
sir.
Were
you
there,
sir?
Yes,
I
was.
And
you
were
also
in
Desert
Storm?
Roger
that,
sir.
How'd
you
come
to
be
I
used
to
hang
around
the
medivac
unit.
Wanted
to
be
a
medic?
Wanted
to
hump
a
nurse
once.
See,
I
play
poker.
Those
medivac
folks,
between
missions,
Want
to
know
a
poker
secret,
sir?
Always.
The
people
you
play
against,
Pretend
you're
interested.
They
start
running
off
at
the
mouth,
Medevac
folks,
Paid
for
this
baby.
So,
talk
to
me
about,
um,...
..25
February.
25
February?
Yes,
sir.
I
had
some
phys
rehab
time.
Got
into
boxing.
Want
a
soda
pop?
No,
sir.
No,
I'm
good.
25
February.
So,
25
February...
Major,
uh,
what's
his
butt?
Garden
party...
Teegarden.
Major
Teegarden.
Right.
Asked
me
to
go
with
Walden,
..so
I
said,
you
know,
OK,
why
not?
Grabbed
me
a
saw,
bungeed
one
of
Yeah.
And,
uh...
..the
captain
was
a
big
hero...
She
died
tragically
in
the
desert,
-
Teegarden.
..wants
her
to
get
the
Medal
of
Honour,
When
did
the
M-16
ammo
run
out?
What?
M-16
ammo?
Blackhawk
crew
said
When
did
it
run
out?
I
wouldn't
know
anything
about
that,
sir.
You
wouldn't?
As...
as
I
recall,
and,
uh...
..I'm
not
really
sure,...
..but
the
M-16
ammo
First
thing
in
the
morning.
Now
I'm
confused.
-
You
were
there,
weren't
you?
But
I
was
on
the
saw.
AItameyer
would
know,
sir.
AItameyer?
-
Yes,
sir.
He
was
manning
the
M-16.
OK,
let's
back
up,
then.
Um,...
..when
that
tank
fired
on
your
chopper,...
..you
said
that,
uh...
..''You
should
go
for
altitude
Sir?
You
knew
this
wasn't
Panama.
Men
were
going
to
die,
Wh...
who
told
you
that,
sir?
It
doesn't
matter
who
told
me
that.
You
don't
want
to
know
Yes,
I
do.
You
just
want
me
to
sign
off
on
the
story...
..so
you
can
finish
your
job
Are
you
refusing
to
tell
me?
Colonel,
you
know
..when
you
pull
the
trigger
You
wait,
with
your
weapon
pointed
in
You
open
your
weapon
..it
blows
up
in
your
face.
Leave
this
round
in
the
chamber,
Colonel.
I
work
at
the
Pentagon,
Sergeant,...
..so
I
admit
I'm
a
Little
slow
on
the
uptake.
Otherwise
I'd
say
you
just
threatened
me.
Did
you
just
threaten
me,
soldier?
Because,
if
you
did,
let
me
respond
to
you.
Let
me
respond
to
you
this
way.
I'm
an
officer,
and
therefore,
..but
don't
abuse
that,
son.
Don't
get
in
my
cross
hairs,
..about
getting
up
to
my
neck
in
your
ass,
She
was
afraid,
Colonel.
That's
the
bottom
line
on
Captain
Walden.
Get
me
around
so
I
can
fire!
-
Go
back.
Let
me
have
another
shot!
I'm
going
for
altitude,
call
for
support.
There's
no
time!
All
right,
one
more!
But
then
I'm
calling
for
support.
Unhook
the
aux
fuel
cells!
llario,
get
me
the
flare
gun.
So
it
was
your
idea
to
use
the
fuel
cell?
Yeah.
Me,
Rady,
somebody.
Adrenaline
was
pumping.
You
can't
Try.
Now!
-
Yay!
So
what
happened
during
the
night?
Walden
and
llario,...
..they
wouldn't
shut
up
about
being
rescued.
Like
the
Army
had
nothing
else
to
do.
Dust
is
blowing
hard
out
there.
-
Think
theyll
find
us
tonight?
SOP
is
for
search
and
rescue
Christ,
Captain,
are
you
crying?
It's
OK.
It's
just
tension.
Hey,
you're
going
to
be
OK,
OK?
Theyll
find
us.
Itll
be
OK.
I
can
hear
the
rag
heads
moving,
They're
going
away.
It
was
just
a
probe.
-
Shit!
-

I
took
one.
Hanging
in.
Captain?
Ah!
Oh!
So
the
rest
of
the
night
Yeah.
Wasn't
that
enough
for
one
night?
You
want
to
continue
this
tomorrow?
I
don't
get
emotional
about
this
shit.
I've
been
there,
you
know?
OK.
Go
on.
Well,
after
the
firefight,
we
argued
mainly.
llario
was
freaked
out
by
the
dark,
and
She
was
a
wreck,
kept
asking
about
I
knew
they'd
attack
at
dawn.
So
what
happened
during
the
evacuation?
Evacuation.

All
right,
let's
go.
There's
the
rescue.
AItameyer,
give
me
a
hand
with
Rady.
-
Come
on,
Captain!
Come
on!
-
No!
Don't
move
me!
Suck
it
up!
I
got
you
covered!
Ready?
Go!
Go!
Go!
-
llario,
move!
Ill
get
her.
No!
I'm
not
leaving!
I'm
not
leaving!
It's
not
safe!
They're
taking
fire!
No!
No!
No!
Get
the
fuck
outta
here!
Come
on!
She
fired
at
you?
Near
us,
yeah.
Then
why
did
you
lie
to
the
investigators
They'd
already
put
together
..before
they
talked
to
me.
I
told
them
But
that's
the
truth,
so
forget
about
the
So
nobody
from
your
Huey
crew
That's
affirmed,
sir.
Monfriez,
you
ready?
You
sure
about
that?
That's
affirmative,
sir.
We
had
no
ammo.
So
how
about
it,
Colonel?
Want
to
go
a
few
rounds?
Are
you
threatening
me,
soldier?
-
Where's
your
brain
bucket?
Don't
step
in
here
without
one.
I
have
to
tell
you
again,
Come
on,
Jersey.
Right
here.
Let's
see
what
you
got.
You
got
nothing,
man.
Come
on!

-

Hello.
How're
you
doing?
Hi.
How',s
it
going?
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
I
was
calling,
I
wondered...
What...
what
kind
of...
What
size
T-shirts
the
kids
wear?
I
want
to
get
the
kids
some
T-shirts.
You
know
their
sizes
as
well
as
I
do.
Are
you
OK?
Nat?
I
got
a
pint
of,
um...
..Scotch
here
in
a
paper
bag.
I
don't
want
to
drink
any
of
it.
Can
you
tell
me
why
you
need
it?
Want
me
to
prattle
on
for
a
minute?

Please.
OK.
Um...
The
new
refrigerator
doesn't
work.
The
light
doesn't
come
on
I
had
to
drive
all
the
way
..just
so
that
Brian
could
practice
He's
afraid
of
falling
in
front
of
his
friends.
He
refuses
to
let
anyone
They've
both
taken
to
sleeping
in
our
bed
It's
like
sleeping
between
two
tornadoes.
I
better
go,
baby.
Don
Boylar
called.
Jesus.
I
better
go.
-
Nat,
talk
to
me.
-
Why
not?
Bullshit.
Bull!
Talk
to
me!

Oh,
Christ.
Colonel?
Colonel?
Can
we
get
some
coffee,
please?
You're
not
a
happy
man.
A
woman?
The
Army?
AI
Bathra?
Talk
to
me.
Off
the
record,
if
you
want.
Way,
way
off
the
record.
Rangers'
honour.
Serling,...
How
long
you
been
back?
Six
months.
And
you...
17
years.
Ah,
they
got
me
running
this
inquiry...
..on
this
girl
pilot.
Captain
Karen
Walden.
Shell
be
the
first
woman
Oh,
boy.
And
everybody
in
the
beltway
I
just
want
to
get
something
clear.
This
time,
just
want
somebody
to
be
a
hero.
I
want
to
get
something
right.
Yeah.
Cos
AI
Bathra,
you
know...
AI
Bathra.
You
talked
to
Boylar's
parents?
Yeah.
Do
they
know?
They
heard
from
a
few
of
his
friends.
Aw,
Jesus...
You
know...
They
told
Boylar's
parents
I
told
them
that.
I
carried
the
message,
..watched
his
mother
cry
her
eyes
out.
I
stood
there
..and
told
him
And
I
was
the
one
I
did
it.
Then
the
Army
gave
me
a
medal...
..for
bravery
and
valour.
Then
they
buried
me...
..in
medals.
Got
a
sense
of
humour,
don't
they?
Yeah.
Can't
remember
anything
else
Either
being
in
it
or
wanting
to
be
in
it.
It's
all
I
know.
Look,
you
need
to
sleep.
You
call
me
any
time.
Anything
you
want
to
say
about
anything,
I'm
going
to
leave
you
alone
for
a
while.
llario.
Are
you
saying
you
can't
find
him,

Sir,
thats
an
l...
l...
That's
right,
specialist
llario.
Well,
we
contacted
the
MPs,
sir...
Roger.
Roger
that.
Thank
you.
Did
she
display
fear
when
she
had

No,
never.
Karen,...
the
captain...
she
had
this
quality.
The
heavier
the
pressure,
And
she...
you
know,
she
put
up
Had
to
work
twice
as
hard
Shed
never
let
the
guard
down,
But
she
was
tough.
She
could
handle
it.
So,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
..is
to
go
forth,...
..to
command
wisely,...
..to
advise
prudently,...
..to
protect
with
vigilance...
..and
to
judge
with
care.
And
above
all,...
..to

your
heart,
..and
all
your
courage...
..the
lives
of
the
men
and

Are
you
now

As
I
explained
to
the
White
House,

we
move
forward.
Another
matter
completely.
That's
my
point,

llario's
disappeared.
Altameyer's
missing.
-
Who?
VA
hospital's
transferred
him
out
Paperwork's
missing.
Doesn't
he
have
any
family?
Negative.
Fucking
VA.
We
can't
wait,
Nat.
You
cannot
imagine
Everybody
wants
it.
Senators,
congressmen,
one
shiny
Whole
episode.
Walden
or
AI
Bathra?
Both,
damn
it,
both.
Submit
your
report
today.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
I
won't
put
my
name
May
I
remind
you
who
recommended
you
You
saying
you
chose
me
Dereliction
of
duty,
At
best,
a
dishonorable
discharge.
At
worst,

Bathra
gives
us
At
least
somebody
has
finally
said
it.
Nat,
don't
do
this.
I
could
give
you
Yes,
you
could.
Put
Hillerman
back
on
the
Walden
file!
I
handed
this
to
you,
Nat,
as
a
way
back.
You
could've
had
one
hell
of
a
career.
And
you
give
Meredith
my
best.
Tell
her
I
didn't
have
any
choice.
I'm
going
to
finish
this
report.
On
my
own,
if
I
have
to.
I'm
going
to
get
this
one
right.
You
want
one?
No,
thank
you.
Why
is
it
people
never
want
to
eat
I
always
want
to
eat.
Need
you
to
help
me
find
somebody.
You
want
my
help?
Yeah.
He
was
the
crew
chief
on
the
medevac
-
One
supposed
to
get
a
Medal
of
Honour?
-
The
Army's
usually
tidy
about
its
people.
First
he
demobbed,
They
transferred
him.
Why
do
you
need
me?
Can't
someone
in
the
Pentagon
help?
I'm
out
of
the
loop.
Somebody
pissed
at
you?
-
I'm
out
of
the
loop.
-
You
want
to
help
me
or
not?
Yeah,
sure,
Ill
help.
Just
tell
me
why
I'm
doing
it.
When
you
go
after
stories,
Yeah.
So
do
I.
OK.
So,
I
help
you
find
this
AItameyer,...
..and
in
return...?
There's
a
tape.
Sweet
Jesus.
There's
always
a
tape.
-
D'you
want
to
hear
this?
Yeah,
go
on.
There's
a
tape
of
all
communications
Are
they
trying
to
make
it
disappear?
I
don't
think
so,
but
they're
not
The
Army
and
its
image.
Where
do
I
reach
you
The
Bethesda
Arms.
A
motel?
-
Bet
everything's
great
in
your
life.

something.
You
look
awful.

Got
any
complaints?
Excuse
me?
Rashes,
fatigue,
bleeding
gums,...
..muscle
and
joint
pain,
..insomnia,
reactions
to
bright
sunlight.
I
drink
too
much.
Does
that
count?
Hell,
we
all
drink
too
much.
Here
he
is.
AItameyer,
you
want
a
shave?
Gentleman
here
to
see
you.
What's
wrong
with
him?
Abdominal
cancer.
There's
many
things
wrong
with
him.
He's
never
awake
very
long
Ill
leave
you
two,
then.
Thank
you.
How
you
doing,
Steven?
I'm
Colonel
Serling.
Nat
Serling.
I
want
to
talk
to
you
They
want
to
give
her
..and
I
know
Roger?
I
was...
..hit.
In
the
back.
Roger.
But
you
were
still
able
to
get
Rady
out.
Rady.
Yeah.
Good
man
Rady.
I
was...
..afraid.
I
understand,
son.

That's
OK.
Take
your
time.
She
was
afraid.
She...
she
was
afraid.
The
Captain
was
afraid?
Not...
..the
Captain.
Who
then?
Was
it
Rady
or
llario?
Was
llario
afraid?
Me.
Did...
didn't
tell.
You
didn't
tell
what,
son?
The
major.
Monfriez.
You
didn't
tell
the
major
Monfriez...
You...
He...
..and
then
they...
You
and
Monfriez
didn't
tell
the
major.

You
and
Monfriez
what,
Steven?
Oh,
Jesus.
What?
What
is
it?
Tell
me
son,
please.
What
is
it?
Jesus.
What?
What?
The
fire.
-
What?
What
fire?
What
fire?
The
napalm
fire?
Jesus.
-
You
see
the
napalm
fire.
Tell
me
about
the
fire.
You
and
Monfriez
-
Please,
Jesus.
Jesus,
please.
Is
it
napalm
fire?
Steven?
Please,
Jesus.
Jesus,
please.
Steven.
Jesus.
Please.
Jesus.
What's
he
doing?
He's
upping
his
meds.
Self-medication.
Well,
can
you
get
him
to
stop?
I
mean,
I
need
to
talk
to
him.
Give
him
a
break.

Left.
Left.
Left.
Left.
Get
off
my
car,
sir.
Think
you
got
I
called
around.
You're
off
this
inquiry,
so
why
you
here?
Karen
Walden
sent
me.
I
just
left
AItameyer.
What
happened
out
there
..that
it
would
have
AItameyer
..that's
got
llario
on
the
run?
That's
right,
he
went
AWOL.
What
do
you
think
hell
tell
them
about
you
And
they're
going
to
catch
him,
son.
Now,
you
can
tell
them,...
..or
you
can
tell
me.
What
happened
out
there?
Nothing
happened.
Nothing
happened,
sir.
It
was
a
war.

Don't
lie
to
me,
soldier.
Don't
lie
to
me.
It
doesn't
matter
It
doesn't
matter
whether
I'm
on
this
inquiry
I'm
going
to
find
out
the
truth.
You
said
you
were
a
good
poker
player.
You
think
I'm
bluffing?
No,
thank
you.
You
want
it.
I
can
smell
how
much
you
want
it.
Tell
me
about
the
fire.
I
like
trains.
Since
I
was
a
kid.
Big...
Tough...
Iron.
Used
to
be
iron,
anyway.
When
I
got
to
boxing
pro,
I
was
going
to
-
Don't
that
have
a
nice
ring
to
it?
Don't
humour
me,
man.
Don't
humour
me,
either.
Where's
my
other
bottle?
You
ever
kill
anyone
It's
messy.
No.
We're
not
talking...
..one
of
your
great
big
tank
guns
here.
Oh,
that's
OK.
I
know
what
you
did.
Your
own
men.
Guys
under
your
command.
How'd
it
feel?
Bad,
right?
Very
bad,
son.
Very
bad.

And
you
didn't
even
mean
to
kill
them.
I've
been
a
good
soldier.
A
good
soldier.

Listen
to
that
whistle.
Johnny
''Night
Train''
Monfriez.
Say
it.
Johnny
''Night
Train''
Monfriez.
Now
get
out.
You
don't
want
to
do
this,
son.
Let
me
help
you.
-
It's
too
late.
Things
get
fucked
up
in
war.
You
can't
do
this.
Wrong!
I
can't
do
anything
else.
Yes,
you
can.
You
can
put
the
car
in
reverse.
We
can
help
each
other.
I
don't
want
to
lose
another
good
soldier.

I
strongly
urge
you...
..to
dismount
the
vehicle,
sir.
Monfriez.
Monfriez!

Aah!

imagine
that.
imagine
not
thinking
its
not
the
doing
shit
that
gets
to
you,
My
folks
used
to
have
this
place
l
still
go
there
sometimes.
Guess
you
told
me
about
this
place
It's
beautiful.
The
MPs
at
Fort
Stewart...
..found
your
stash
in
your
locker.
Pretty
ingenious
place
to
keep
it,
huh?
Not
if
you
wanted
it
to
be
found.
Where'd
you
hide
the
needle
tracks?
I,
uh...
I
shoot
up
between
my
toes.
Monfriez
is
dead.
Killed
himself.
AItameyer
is
dying.
Aren't
we
all?
Mayday!
Mayday!
We're
going
down!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
We're
going
down!
We're
going
down!
And
the
chopper
went
down?
What
happened
next?
What
happened
next
isn't
important.
Monfriez
wanted
to
make
a
run
for
it.
At
dawn
we're
dead.
Escape
and
evasion,
Captain.
Now's
the
time
to
do
it.
I
told
you,...
..Rady
can't
be
moved.
Right,
llario?
That
lung
-
any
movement
may
kill
him.
You
see?
Oh,
great.
Great.
The
Captain's
crying.
It's
just
tension,
asshole.
It
doesn't
mean
shit.
Come
on,
Captain.
llario?
-
I
don't
know.
That'd
be
great
if
this
was
a
democracy,
We
stay
with
Rady.
I
wouldn't
risk
your
life.
I
won't
risk
his.
So
if
we
surrender,
No
surrender.

I
hear
something
moving.
-
I
say
we
make
for
the
chopper
now.
You
don't
have
to
go.
I
am
in
command
here!
Well,
maybe
not
any
more.
Give
me
the
saw,
Monfriez.
I
can't
stop
you
from
running,
but
You're
not
taking
away
my
weapon.
Yes,
I
am.
Hey,
I
can
make
a
white
flag,
all
right?
There's
no
way
Section
28-J,...
..code
of
millitary
justice.
Mutiny,...
..an
offence
punishable
by
death.
Jesus,
Monfriez.
Shut
up!
She's
trying
to
get
us
killed!
llario,
who
you
with?
Come
on,
llario,
shithead,
Please,
Captain.
Oh!
Unh.
They're
going
away.
It
was
just
a
probe.
Oh.
Shit.

Are
you
all
right?

Shit!
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
Shit.
I
don't
fucking
believe
it.
Give
me
your
weapon.
Christ,
I
thought
you
were
firing
at
me!

You're
wounded,
ma'am.
Let
me
see.
You're
with
him.
You
got
to
let
me
look
at
it.
Christ,
let
him
look
at
it!
I
gave
birth
to
a
nine-pound
baby,...
..asshole!
I
think
I
can
handle
it!
Cap,
we
got
to
get
you
out
of
here.
We
stay
with
Rady.
-
And
then?
-

Incoming!
150
metres
and
closing!

140!

130!
Give
me
my
weapon!
llario,
how's
Rady?
-
He's
dead!
Come
on,
Captain,
give
him
his
weapon!
-
This
is
insane!
Give
me
my
weapon!
90
metres
and
closing!
80!
I'm
sorry.
OK.
OK.
OK,
well
get
you
out
of
here,
Captain.
It's
all
over.
No,
Monfriez,...
..it's
not
over.
There
will
be
a
reckoning.
Count
on
it.
Hey,
what's
that?

There's
the
rescue!
Let's
move
it!
Move
it!
Move
it!
Move
it!
No!
Wait.
Help
Rady.
We're
pinned
down
here!
llario,
give
me
the
M-16.
Give
me
the
goddamn
M-16!
Ill
cover
you.
Go!
Ill
cover
you!
Negative,
ma'am!
Come
back
for
me
-
Karen,
please!
Karen,
please!
Go!
Go!
Wait!
Wait!
Where's
Walden?
She's
dead!
No!
Monfriez
said
she
would
AItameyer
was
too
fucked
up
to
say
anything.
She
was...
She
was
probably
killed
by
small
arms...
..before
the
napalm
ever
hit.
Either
way,...
..she
never
could
have
You
think
that
matters?
No.
No.
Hmm.
I
couldn't
bear
to
send
this.
Uh,
I
didn't
even
want
to...
I
didn't
even
want
to
touch
it.
Uh...
Can
you
get
it
to
her
parents
for
me?
Can
you...?
Please?
Yeah.
Uh,
listen,
You
got
off
the
phone
for
me?
-
Youll
want
me
there
for
this.
Remember
that
stereo
you
told
me
not
to
buy
When
does
anyone
ever
have
Nat,
just
the
man
I
wanted
to
see.
Uh,
do
you
know
Colonel
Serling?
This
is
Tony
Gartner
He
was
with
the
9th
in
Vietnam.
Mr.
Gartner.
Colonel.
Take
a
seat,
Nat.
He's
following
up
..and
it
seems
that
he
has
a
few
questions
Let's
give
him
every
facility.
-
I
appreciate
that.
I
insist
we
be
allowed
to
schedule
..to
the
public
regarding
casualties.
Well,
I
wish
I
could
accommodate
you,
sir,...
..but,
unfortunately,
well
be
going
with
..of
all
radio
communications
that
night.
So,...
..I'd
like
you
to
listen...
..and
then
comment
for
the
record.
I
can't
comment
for
the
record.
This
is
an
ongoing
investigation.

First
right!
Turn
to
the
right!
Sabre-6,
this
is
Bobcat-5.
Enemy
tangos!

Sabre-6,
this
is
Cougar-6.
-
I
don't
think
any
more
of
this...

Liberty-6,
this
is
Sabre-6.
Patella,
find
me
a
target.
-
l
think
l
got
one,
sir.
It
must
be,
sir.
Theyre
firing
at
us.
Loader!
Up,
sir!
Fire!
On
the
way!
-
Target!
We
got
that
sucker!
Sabre-6,
we
just
lost
Cougar-6.
Roger
that,
sir.
We
got
him.
-
You
just
lit
up
a
friendly.
-
You
just
lit
up
a
friendly,
goddamn
it!
Cougar-6
was
one
of
your
own
Abrams,
Yes,
that's
correct.
Sabre-6,
Nat,
whats
happening?

Patella,
was
that
one
of
our
tanks?
They
fired.
At
us
or
at
the
T-72s?
l
don',t
know.
-
At
us
or
at
the
T-72s,
Patella?
-
Colonel
Serling,
report
status
now.
They
have
range
on
us!
All
Sabre
elements,
I
say
again,
Sabre-6,
Nat,
whats
happening
out
there?
Load
us
up.
Patella,
find
me
a
target.
Patella,
come
on!
-
Target!
-
Lights
on
or
off?
-
Fire!
-
Sir?
Colonel
Serling,
report
status
now!
Sabre-6,
situation
under
control,
General.
General,
Colonel
Serling's
order
..was
that
a
standard
response
At
the
critical
moment,...
..in
spite
of
terrible
losses,...
..Colonel
Serling
didn't
hesitate
to
act.
Ordering
those
tanks
..saved
the
lives
Heroic
acts
arise...
..out
of
desperate
circumstances.
I
have
no
trouble
at
all
Like
Captain
Karen
Walden.
Did
you
know,
Mr.
Gartner,
for
the
first
time
..for
the
Medal
of
Honour
And,
um,...
..Colonel
Serling...
..is
just
finishing
up
the
inquiry.
How's
that
going,
Nat?
I
think,
uh,...
..in
order
to
honour
..we
have
to
tell
the
truth,
General,...
..about
what
happened
over
there.
The
whole,
hard,...
..cold
truth.
And
until
we
do
that,
uh,...
..we
dishonor
her...
..and
every
soldier
who
died,...
..who
gave
their
life
for
their
country.
My
full
report,
General.
Few
of
us
are
given
the
opportunity,...
..even
fewer
the
courage,...
..to
sacrifice
ourselves
In
daily
life,
even
as
in
battle,...
..each
one
of
us
is
mysteriously
And
yet,...
..it
is
only
in
death
..is
finally
tested
and
proven.
And
who
among
us
really
knows...
..how
he
might
respond

I
guess
we've
been
expecting
you.
Ahem.
First
of
all,
let
me,
um...
Let
me
just
say
that,
uh,...
..there
was
nothing
that,
uh,...
..Tom
and
I
wouldn't
do
for
each
other.
Nothing.
He
was
a
good
soldier.
He
was
like
a
brother
to
me.
That
night,
uh,
25
February...
..there
were
enemy
tanks
in
our
lines.
We
thought...
I...
I
thought
that,
uh,...
..Tom's
tank
was
an
enemy
tank.
And,
uh,...
..I
gave
the
order
to
fire.
God
help
me.
I,
um...
Yeah,
I
killed
him.
As
for
the
funeral,...
..the
lies
the
Army
told...
..and
the
lies
that
I
told...
..to
you,
I
can
only...
..beg
for
your
forgiveness.
As
far
as
the...
As
far
as
that
night,
um,...
..I
guess
there's
no
way
that,
uh,...
..I
can
even
begin
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me.
I
know
that,...
..but
it's
a
burden
Thank
you,
sir.
Mr.
President.


Dear
Mom
and
Dad,...
..well,
this
is
it
-
the
big
push.
Looks
like
it's
gonna
really
happen.
And
I'm
afraid,...
..not
of
being
hurt
or
killed,...
..well,
kind
of,
but
not
much.
My
only
regret
will
be
..and
that
Ill
never
see
Anne
Marie
grow
up.
But
I
know
she's
in
good
hands,
the
best.
What
I'm
really
afraid
of
is
that
These
people
depend
on
me.
I
just
can't
fall
'em.
Now,
I
know
if
you
get
this
letter...
..it
means
I'm
dead.
I
only
hope
that
I've
made
you
proud,...
..that
I
did
my
job,...
..and
I
didn't
let
down
my
country,...
..my
crew,
my
fellow
soldiers.
I
Love
you
guys.
Never
stop
telling
Anne
Marie
Your
daughter,
Karen.
You
got
it?
All
right.
