SOLDIER
1:
Move!
Move!
Move!
Now!

It's
me
-
Bye,
Bruno!
-
MOTHER:
Hello,
sweetheart.
-
We're
celebrating.
Your
father's
been
given
a
promotion.
-
That
means
a
better
job.
So
we're
having
a
little
party
He's
still
going
to
be
a
soldier
though,
Yes,
my
lamb.
There's
some
even
more
exciting
news,
but
I
think
Dad
wanted
-
Moving?
Where
to?
That's
miles
away.
Sweetheart,
I
know
it's
hard,
but
we're
all
having
to
say
goodbye
Anyway,
we'll
make
new
ones
Of
course
you
are.
Bruno,
you
can
have
your
friends
Think
of
it
as
an
adventure,
But
this
is
the
best
house
ever.
Well,
you
never
know.
The
house
-
Dad
says
it's
got
a
garden.
Look,
the
thing
is,
Bruno,
is
that
life
is
not
so
much
about
choice,
so
if
your
country
needs
Now,
of
course,
going
somewhere
else
when
you
know
that
your
family

Bruno!
You're
getting
bigger
It's
only
been
a
week,
Nathalie.
Well,
perhaps
it's
me

So,
you
two,
well,
what
do
you
think
of
all
this?
Well,
Mummy
and
Daddy
say
-
so
I
suppose
it
must
be.
Children,
be
angels,
will
you?

OFFICERS:
Heil
Hitler!
MAN:
Congratulations.
-
Doesn't
he
look
wonderful?
I'm
so
proud
of
you,
my
boy.
Oh,
dear.
I
sometimes
wonder
making
you
those
costumes
-
You
used
to
adore
all
that
dressing
up.
Does
it
still
make
you
feel
special,
The
uniform
and
what
it
stands
for?
Mother,
it's
a
party.

Me,
spoil
things?
You
should
be
careful.
Airing
your
views
so
publicly
You
know
that.

So,
how
long
are
we
losing
you
for,
-
Until
the
war
is
won,
I
would
think.
MAN:

You've
got
to
smile
You've
got
to
smile
as
the
days
go
by
And
all
the
time
that
you're
away
I'll
write
and
say
from
day
to
day
You've
got
to
smile
You've
got
to
smile
So
till
we
meet
again
Say
cheerio
and
then
Give
me
a
smile


MOTHER:
Bruno!
All
right,
Bruno.
Time
to
say
goodbye.
-
Bye-bye.
GRETEL:

has
come

Children,
look.
Look!

new

I
have
some
business
to
take
care
of.
Well,
what
do
we
think?
Hmm?
Come
on.
It's
lovely.
You

your
rooms.
and
help
you
unpack.


What
do
you
think
of
it,
Maria?
Um...
It's
not
for
me
to
say.
But
it
won't
feel
like
home
SOLDIER:
Is
he
already
up?

Who
was
that?
One
of
your
father's
soldiers,
I
suppose.
-
He
looked
very
serious.
-
Why
are
we
whispering?

-
MOTHER:
And
play
with
who?
Farm?
I
didn't
see
a
farm.
You
can
only
see
it
from
my
room.
Hmm.
And
there
are
-
Yes,
quite
a
few.
-
So,
I'll
be
able
to
play
with
them.
I'll
wait
a
little
bit,
-
because
they
look
a
bit
strange.
-
Well,
and
the
farmers.

I'm
sorry.
Vegetables.
There.
Bruno,
have
you
unpacked
everything?
Because
I
think
you
should

MOTHER:
Bruno.
-
I
told
you
they
were
strange.
The
farmers.
They
wear
pyjamas.

Oh,
Bruno,
I
was
just
Well,
thank
you
for
that.
-
I'll
be
over
to
see
you
later.
FATHER:
Come
in.
Sit
down,
sit
down.
Well,
what
do
you
think?
Oh,
dear.
I
want
to
go
home.
You
are
home,
Bruno.
Isn't
that
right?
Bruno,
you
have
to
at
least
I
promise
you,
Why
do
the
farmers
wear
pyjamas?
The
thing
is,
Bruno,
those
people...
Well,
you
see,

Bruno,
who
told
you
it
was
a
farm?
-
Was
it
Maria?
It
is
a
farm,
isn't
it?
MOTHER:
Yes.
Is
it
to
do
with
your
new
job?
All
you
need
to
know
is
that
it's
very
important
We're
working
very
hard
for
you
to
grow
up
in.
But
you're
not
a
farmer.
Bruno,
can
you
come
and
help
me
I
can
still
play
with
them,
though?

Like
you
say,
they're
a
bit
strange.
Well,
they're
different.
Don't
worry,
my
darling.
but
they
won't
be
the
ones
Ralf,
you
promised.
-
You
said
it
was
miles
away.
How
was
I
to
know
he
could
see
it
There
was
one
of
them
in
our
kitchen.


-
Master
Bruno,
how
are
you
today?
MARIA:
Oh...
You
said
the
same
thing
-
It's
true.
-
Playing
with
who?
-
Well,
you
can
make
your
own
fun.
One
thing's
for
sure,
sitting
around
being
miserable


-
Bruno,
what
are
you
doing?
No!
No,
not
in
the
back.
-
Explore
at
the
front.
-
Well,
find
something
else
to
do.
Come
back
in
now,
(BOMBASTIC

So,
children,
what
are
you
doing
today?
-
Same
as
yesterday.
-
Same
as
the
day
before.
-
I
like
exploring.
I
wanted
to
look
in
the
back
garden,
The
back
garden?
Well,
God
forbid.
I
expect
you'll
be
missing
I
even
miss
school.

Well,
I
never
thought
Anyway,
you
won't
be
missing
it

Really?

Liszt
BRUNO:
So
we're
not
going
to
school?
-
School's
coming
here?
On
an
old
bicycle,
I
gather.
Hmm.
KOTLER:
It's
a
bird
without
the...


Good
morning,
little
man.
-
Can
I
ask
you
a
favour?

Are
there
any
spare
tyres
around?
An
old
one
Well,
the
only
spare
tyre
belongs
to
Lieutenant
Meinberg.

-
Well,
is
he
using
it?
Oh,
stop
it.
He
doesn't
understand.
You're
only
12,
What
do
you
want
a
tyre
for,
anyway?
-
I
want
to
make
a
swing.
That
does
sound
exciting.
You!
Here,
now.
Move!
Take
this
boy
to
the
outhouse
There
are
some
tyres
in
there.
You
will
carry
it
where
he
asks.
Well,
little
man,
How
about
this
one?

Where's
my
mum?
She's
out.
-
When
is
she
back?
But
don't
worry.
-
But
I
might
bleed
to
death.
-
Will
I
need
to
go
to
hospital?

Come
on.
It's
not
that
bad.
There,
all
better.
-
What's
your
name?
Now,
you've
got
to
sit
still
before
you
start
Will
you
tell
my
mum
what
happened?
I
think
she's
going
to
see
it
for
herself.
She'll
probably
take
me
to
a
doctor.
I
don't
think
so.
-
It
could
be
worse
than
it
looks.
How
would
you
know?
-
Yes,
I
am.
You
peel
potatoes.
I
practised
as
a
doctor.
Before
I...
Before
I
came
here.
You
couldn't
have
been
much
good

Now,
what
are
you
going
to
be
I
know.
An
explorer.
How
do
you
know
that?
Is
it
nice
on
the
farm?

Bruno.
Bruno,
what
happened
to
you?
I
made
a
swing,
But
Pavel
here,
he
carried
me
in
-
Go
to
your
room.
Don't
argue.
Go
to
your
room.
Thank
you.
It's
not
fair,
you
having
this
view.
Well,
I'm
not
swapping.

I
think
school's
here.
LISZT:
No,
I
mean
more
recent
history.
-
Are
you
interested
in
current
affairs?
So,
you'll
be
aware
of
the
situation
in
which
our
great
nation
Yes.
I
read
newspapers
whenever
I
can
keeps
me
up
to
date
Good.
And
you,
Bruno.
-
Have
you
been
reading
anything?
Good.
What
sort
of
books?
Adventure
books,
mainly.
You
know,
knights
in
shining
armour,
and
silly
princesses
Ah!
Well,
this
is
why
I'm
here
to
help.
Time
to
get
your
head
and
start
learning
about
fact.
Time,
I
think,
and
I
believe
Die,
die!
Die,
die.

Hello.
I'm
exploring.
-
What
are
you
doing?
BRUNO:
Have
you
got
A
few.
But
we
fight
a
lot.
That's
why
I
like
being
out
here.
-
I'm
Bruno.
-
Sorry?
That's
your
name?
Never
heard
I've
never
heard
But
Shmuel.
No
one's
called
Shmuel.
I
live
in
the
house,
back
there.
-
Have
you
got
any
food
on
you?
Are
you
hungry?
How
old
are
you?
-
Eight.
It's
not
fair,
while
you're
over
there,
-
Playing?
-
Isn't
it
a
part
of
a
game
or
something?
Everyone
gets
given
a
different
number.
Oh,
right.
Then
what
happens?

-
I
have
to
go
back
now!
Yeah.
It
was
nice
to
meet
you,
Shmuel.
And
you,
Bruno.

Bye.
Mum,
I
can't
find
my
football.
Well,
it'll
be
It
isn't.
I've
looked.
Can
I
have
a
piece
of
chocolate?
A
piece.
Yes.

Bruno?
-
Have
you
looked
in
the
cellar?
For
your
football.
Oh.


Damn.
-
Gretel,
I've
just
seen
all
your...
All
your
dolls,
down
in
the
cellar.
Dolls
are
for
little
girls.
It's
not
right
to
play
with
silly
toys
while
people
are
away

Bruno,
there
you
are.
I'm
just
going
into
town
for
an
hour.
You
be
careful
on
that
thing.
Thank
you.
BRUNO:
Can
I
ask
you
something?
Why
do
you
people
-
They're
not
pyjamas.
We
have
to.
-
Who
did?
The
soldiers?
Why?
I
don't
like
soldiers.
Do
you?
I
do,
quite.
My
dad's
a
soldier,
but
not
the
sort
that
takes
What
sort,
then?
Well,
he's
the
important
sort.
He's
in
charge
of

-
So
is
your
dad
a
farmer?
Or
was.
Most
of
the
time
now,
It's
funny
how
grown-ups
about
what
they
want
to
do.
Do
you
know
him?
Lives
over
there.
He
used
to
be
a
doctor,
Can
I
ask
you
another
question?
What
do
you
burn
in
those
chimneys?
I
saw
them
going
the
other
day.
I
don't
know.
Mama
says
it's
old
clothes.
Well,
whatever
it
is,
it
smells
horrid.

I
wish
Yes,
I'm
sorry.
I
know!
Perhaps
you
can
come
I
can't,
can
I?
Because
of
this.
But
that's
to
stop
Animals?
Are
you
not
allowed
out?
-
Why?
What
have
you
done?
I
think
I
should
go
now.
-
Will
you
be
here
tomorrow?
-
Goodbye,
then!


Little
present,
sweetheart.

Thank
you,
Mummy.
-
Have
you
seen
Bruno?
Yes,
Thursday's
perfect.
Are
Grandma
and
Grandpa
coming?
Hey,
did
you
smell
-
Coming
from
the
chimneys.
The
day
I
fell
off
the
swing.
-
Did
you
smell
it,
Mum?
Mum.
Let
me
speak
to
her.
Yes,
she
is.
I
can
hear
her.

Yes.
We
look
forward
to
it.
Goodbye.
-
Is
Grandma
not
coming?
She's
poorly,
apparently,
-
Did
you
smell
it,
Dad?
That
horrid
smell
from
the
chimneys.
I
think
they
just
burn
rubbish
-
Look.
GRETEL:
Hey!

Hey,
that's
not
fair!
-
Gretel.
It's
only
a
game.
Ralf,
this
tutor
you
brought
in,
does
he
usually
teach
children
I
believe
so.
Why?
Well,
do
we
know
Gretel
seems
to
have
become
so...
They're
being
taught
what
all
children
They
mustn't
get
left
behind.
Come
on.
Let's
get
to
bed.

Master
Bruno.
What
are
you
doing?
You've
just
I
was
going
for
a
walk,
But
don't
make
a
mess
of
your
satchel.
-
I'll
wrap
it
properly
for
you.
Bruno,
what
is
it?
What
are
you
doing
with
your
satchel?
Herr
Liszt
gave
us
some
books.
-
Let
me
see.
-
The
books.
Bruno,
I
just
want
to
see
-
I
told
a
lie.
I've
just
got
adventure
books.

Now,
Maria,
The
Kommandant's
father
will
be
here,
and
I
believe
Here.


What's
the
matter?
-
Don't
throw
it
back.
-
It's
dangerous.
It's
just
a
ball.
Come
on.
Do
you
not
like
playing?
-
Just
not
ball
games?
-
Tell
me
how
the
number
game
works.
We
just
all
have
numbers.


Shmuel!
Bruno!
What
are
you
doing?
My
ball
went
over.

They
smell
even
worse
What?
But,
surely
you...
Elsa,
I
was
sworn
to
secrecy.
-
From
your
own
wife.
I
took
an
oath
upon
my
life.
Elsa,
you
believe
in
this,
too.
-
You
want
this
country
to
be
strong...
How
can
you...
-
Because
I'm
a
soldier.
-
Soldiers
fight
wars.
It's
a
part
of
it!
It's
a
vital
part
of
it!
The
Fatherland
we
all
desire,
cannot
be
achieved

-
Elsa.
Elsa.
Grandpa's
here.
-
I
don't
believe
this.
We'll
be
through
in
a
moment.
Who
told
you
about
this?
How's
Grandma?
She's
a
bit
under
the
weather,
It's
a
shame,
she
was
so
much
-
Perhaps
next
time,
if
she
feels
up
to
it.
You
know,
Ralf,
She's
been
talking
about
this
visit
Maybe
that's
what's
made
her
sick.
GRANDPA:
So,
your
father
tells
me
Yes.
He's
nice.
BRUNO:
But
he
won't
let
us
read
All
we
do
is
boring,
old
history.
GRANDPA:
Let
me
tell
you
something,
If
it
wasn't
for
history,
we
wouldn't
The
work
your
father
is
doing
here,
history
in
the
making.
When
I
was
your
age,
history
was
which
obviously
Hmm.
Why
not?
Well,
he
was
a
professor
of
literature
Really,
does
he
still
teach?
-
I
don't
really
know.
We're
not
in
touch,
my
father
and
I.
Really,
when?
About
four
years
ago,
But
surely
he
can't
be
very
old.
Where
did
he
go?
Lieutenant
Kotler,
your
father,
the
professor
of
literature,
I
believe
it
was
Switzerland,
FATHER:
How
strange
that
he
should
at
the
very
moment
it
needed
him
most.
Just
when
we're
all
required
More
wine!
What
reason
did
he
give?
KOTLER:
Herr
Kommandant?
Did
he
go
there
to
take
the
air?
I'm
afraid
I
really
don't
know,
You'd
have
to
ask
him.
Well,
that
would
be
rather
difficult,
With
him
being
in
Switzerland.
Come
on!
What's
the
matter
with
you
tonight?
Yes,
perhaps
that
was
it.
Unless,
of
course,
-
I
mean,
with
government
policy.
Disturbed,
most
of
them,
FATHER:
Even
so,
all
of
them
traitors.
Presumably,
you
will
have
informed
your
superiors,
Lieutenant
Kotler!
You
cretin
Jew!
Filth!

Ralf!
KOTLER:
Jew!
-
BRUNO:
But
Dad
just
sat
there.
The
Jew
deserved
it.
Can
I
ask
you
something
Oh,
Bruno,
you
don't
still
think
It's
a
camp.
What's
called
a
work
camp.
For
Jews,
obviously.
Just
Jews?
Because
they're
the
best
workers?
They're
not
in
there
They're
no
good
at
anything.
They're
in
there
because
they're
evil.
-
They're
the
enemy.
-
But
I
thought
we
were
fighting...
Evil,
dangerous
vermin.
They're
the
reason
Haven't
you
been
listening
to
anything
No.
Not
really.
Dad's
not
horrible,
is
he?
-
Of
course,
he
is.
It's
only
horrible
for
them,
Bruno.
We
should
be
proud
of
Dad,
He's
making
the
country
great
again.
MOTHER:
Like
you
say,
Well,
they're
different.
GRETEL:
They're
the
enemy,
Bruno.
Evil,
dangerous
vermin.
FATHER:
Well,
you
see,
What
are
you
doing
here?
They
wanted
someone
with
tiny
fingers
We're
not
supposed
to
be
friends,
We're
meant
to
be
enemies.
Do
you
want
some?
-
What's
your
dad
like?
Is
he
a
good
man?
You've
never
thought
he
wasn't?
And
you're
proud
of
him?
Aren't
you
proud
of
yours?
Is
it
really
horrible
in
the
camp?

How
dare
you
How
dare
you!
Are
you
eating?
Have
you
been
stealing
food?
-
Answer
me!
He's
my
friend.
What?
Little
man,
do
you
know
this
Jew?
Do
you
know
this
Jew?
No,
I
just
walked
in,
I've
never
seen
him
before
in
my
life.
You,
finish
cleaning
the
glasses.
When
I
come
back,
about
what
happens
to
rats
who
steal.

Goodbye,
little
man.
Shmuel!
Shmuel!
I
don't
understand.
I
saw
a
film
about
the
camp,
and
it
looked
so
nice.
I
don't
know
why
I
did
it.
Gretel
and
everyone
and
that
soldier's
so
scary.
Been
coming
here
for
days,
I
thought
maybe
Shmuel,
I'm
really
sorry
for
what
I
did.

Where's
Kurt
these
days?
-
Who's
Kurt?
He's
been

to
the
front.
It
was

that
would
be

to
better

there.

In
actual
fact,
Gretel,
he
was
sent
there
because
he
failed
of
his
father's
Which
was
his
duty,
I
might
add.
-
Which
was
his
bad
luck.
Well,
bad
luck
that
it
was
his
father
One

FATHER:

What?
-
Mum?
It's

They've
been

My
grandma
and
grandpa
both
died
but
there
weren't
any
funerals.
That
one
there
to
there.
They
both
died
at
the
same
time?
What
of?
I
don't
know.
Papa
said
they
must
have
caught
They
had
to
go
to
a
hospital
We
didn't
see
them
again.

This
is
fun.
Wish
we
could
do
something
-
That
one
there
to
there.
-
This
one?
-
This
one
to
here?
-

To
here?
-
Here?

-
I
don't
want
you
to
go
away
again.
FATHER:
You
can't
behave
like
this!
MOTHER:
You're
questioning
FATHER:
It
can't
continue!
MOTHER:
I
know.
I
can't
stay
here
and
be
a
part
of
this.
FATHER:
Don't
you
think
MOTHER:
Questions?
about
my
ability
to
carry
out
my
work
MOTHER:
Work?
FATHER:
Pull
yourself
together,
MOTHER:
Right.
Ignore
the
fact
Even
your
own
mother
Are
you
happy
here?
Yes.
Very.
And
you,
Gretel?
Well,
I
was,
but
I
do
miss
home.
Yes,
I'm
sure.
And
you,
too,
Bruno.
No.
Not
any
more,
really.
I
suppose
the
real
question
is,
would
you
prefer
GRETEL:
Back
home?
Somewhere
safe,
say
Aunt
Lottie's
All
of
us?
You
as
well?
No.
That
won't
be
possible
just
yet,
I
must
stay
See,
at
the
moment,
She
just
feels
right
now
you
need
Would
you
like
that?
I'm
afraid,
Bruno,
in
life,
we
often
The
important
thing
is
that
this
is
an
appropriate
place
for
you
and
the
more
I
think
about
it,
the
more
-
But,
Dad...
It's
time
for
you
to
move
away.
Is
everything
all
right?
We
can't
find
Papa.
He
went
on
a
different
work
duty
and
they
haven't
come
back.
I've
got
some
bad
news,
too.
How
long
for
this
time?
That's
why
it's
bad.
It's
forever,
I
think.
Mum
says
this
is
no
place
for
children,
-
When
do
you
go?
So,
I
won't
ever
see
you
again?
Yes,
you
will.
You
can
come
on
holiday
when
everybody's
getting
on
I
wish
I
could've
helped
you
I
really
want
to
make
up
That
would
have
done
it,
wouldn't
it?
Would've
been
great.
-
I
could
dig
under.
-
No,
but
I
could
bring
something.
Look.
-
I
could
come
through
to
your
side.
Your
dad's
not
going
to
be
over
here,
But
I'd
stick
out
though,
wouldn't
I,
I
don't
look
like
you.

You
could
look
like
me,
though.
If
you
dressed
like
me
I'm
not
shaving
my
hair
off.
-
You
could
cover
it
with
a
cap.
I
could
bring
some.
thousands
of
them.
-
I
want
to
do
it.
-
I
want
to
help
you
find
your
dad.
Tomorrow,
then?
And
don't
forget
the
pyjamas!
Bruno?
Mum,
can
I
go
and
play
on
the
swing?

-
Bruno...
All
right.
Go
on
then.

-
I
thought
you
weren't
coming!
I'm
not
meant
to
be
out
here
today.
-
Did
you
bring
the
sandwich?
Oh.
Shmuel.
Here.
How
do
I
look?

Right.
Let's
get
going.
Bruno?
SHMUEL:
That's
enough.

Let's
go
and
find
your
dad.
Come
on!
Master
Bruno?
BRUNO:
Shmuel.
-
Can
we
go
to
the
caf
or
something?
-
Maybe
I
should
go
home.
Yeah.
We'll
check
our
hut
first.
Bruno?
SHMUEL:
Come
on.
Papa?
SOLDIER:
Up!
Up!
Get
up!
-
What's
happening?
We
go
on
marches
sometimes.
Move!
Up,
up!

Move,
move!
Bruno!
He
must
still
be
Bruno!
Bruno?
-
Move!
PRISONER:
Get
up!
Get
up.
You
must!
SOLDIER:
Move
them
out!
FATHER:
which
means
that
would
be
almost
tripled,
so,
therefore,
-
Ralf.
Bruno's
missing.
Come
on!
Wait
here!

SHMUEL:
Come
on!
SOLDIER
1:
Move!
Move!

Join
the
queue!
SOLDIER
2:
Come
on,
you!
Bruno!
Move
it!
Go
on.
Bruno!
It's
all
right.
I
think
we're
just
waiting
SOLDIER
3:
Clothes
off!
PRISONER:
Where
are
we
going?
No,
it's
just
a
shower.
A
shower?
FATHER:

Open
the
gates!
Open
the
gates!
Move!

Bruno!
