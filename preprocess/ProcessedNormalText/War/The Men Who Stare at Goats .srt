Boone?
I'm
going
into
the
next
office.
Yes,
sir.
Damn
it!
My
name
is
Bob
Wilton.
Part
of
my
job
is
finding
If
you
were
looking
at
my
story,
when
I
got
a
job
at
the
Or
you
might
think
it
began...
...when
I
married
But
you'd
be
wrong.
Because
the
real
story
of
my
life
when
my
editor
sent
me
he'd
heard
on
the
talk
radio
show.
The
guy
claimed
to
have
That
he
could
travel
with
just
his
mind
He
called
it
"Remote
Viewing".
The
man's
name
was
Gus
Lacey.
What
have
you
seen
lately?
Lately,
I've
been
watching
Thanks,
Mom.
I
got
it.
I
got
it.
Thank
you.
It
turns
out...
It's
the
ghost
of
a
dinosaur.
Okay.
Wow.
So,
when
did
this
all
It
started
when
I
was
a
kid.
Gus
told
me
that
he
was
part
of
a
top-secret
unit
In
a
program
sanctioned
When
I
asked
him
what's
the
purpose
We
were
Psychic
Spies,
mainly.
Once
they
realized
We
were
trained
to
kill
animals.
-
What?
With...
Just
by
staring
at
them.
What
kind
of
animals?
One
of
our
unit's
Power...
they
unleashed
in
us.
Last
week
I
killed
my
hamster.
You
wanna
see?
There!
Look!
You
ever
seen
a
hamster
-
I've
never
owned
a
hamster,
Gus,
so...
See
the
way
it's
glaring
Yeah,
I
guess
our
hamster-owning
aberrant
behavior
and
what...
-
Oh,
shit!
Shit!
He's
down!
At
this
point
I'd
been
staring
at
him
Bizarre,
right?
What
is
that?
It
didn't
die.
Yeah,
well...
Mom
said
no.
She
said:
"Show
the
tape
where
You
should
have
seen
-
Who's
the
Skipper?
For
me,
after
Bill
he
was
the
He
was
like
an
occultic
force.
I
think
he
runs
a
dance
studio
now.
The
little
man
inside
me
You
know,
the
little
man.
He's
the
one
who
says:
"Stay
in
your
little
town,
"You're
a
lucky
guy,
"You
have
everything
you
want.
"
"You're
not
looking
for
"But
then,
one
day...
...when
you
least
expect
it,
"The
great
adventure
finds
you!"
Ron's
sudden
death
Deborah
told
me
later
that
What
people
used
to
call:
Ron's
massive
coronary
...life
was
just
too
short
to
And
his
death
that
helped
her
A
week
after
the
funeral...
...she
left
me
for
my
editor.
It
seemed
like
such
a
tragedy
We
couldn't
see
beyond
...to
the
great
events
of
history
I
was
like
a
child
or
a
Hobbit,
Or
a
blond
farm
boy
...unaware
that
he
was
already
...that
would
lead
him
relentlessly
...between
the
forces
of
Americans
are
a
resolute
people,
...who
have
risen
Adversity
has
revealed
...to
the
world.
Had
I
known
where
that
path
...had
a
soft
wind
from
my
future
...I
might
never
have
gone.
But
as
it
was,
I
did
what
so
many
men
...when
a
woman
has
broken
I
went
to
war.
THE
MEN
WHO
STARE
AT
GOATS
-
So,
have
you
seen
any
combat?
Well,
I
won't
lie
to
you
Debora,
Yeah.
We've
been
Yeah,
it's
not,
uh...
I've
seen
things
that
Well,
I
don't
even
know
Well,
I
think
it's
important,
-
What?
-
what's
happening,
so...
-
So,
what
is
that...
is
that
Dave?
He
says
"Hi.
"
Oh,
that's,
huh...
Is
he
gonna
get
his
stuff
That's...
I...
I
gotta
go.
We're
moving
out,
riding
up
Wait,
Bob,
I'm
just...
So,
what's
a
useful
phrase?
La
tutlek.
Ana
sahaffi.
-
La
tutlek.
Ana
sahaffi.
-
What's
that
mean?
Okay,
that
I'll
mind.
La
tutlek.
Ana
sahaffi.
I've
been
waiting
for
months
for
All
that
time,
I'd
seen
...coming
back,
They
all
ignored
me.
I
had
to
get
into
Iraq
somehow.
Or
I
would
never
again
My
wife,
or
that
DeWitt
Resources,
uh,
That's
right.
You're
here
for
the
conference,
right?
-
I
guess.
Well...
we're
real
cheap.
-
Bob
Wilton.
-
Do
you
mind
if
I...?
-
So
you're
from
Arkansas?
-
Been
here
long?
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for.
I
wanted
to
prove
myself.
And
for
my
sins...
Faith
taught
me
a
lesson.
Lyn
Cassady?
Lyn

For
me,
after
Bill
he
was
the
Do
you
know
a
Gus
Lacey?
Skip?
Hello?
Lyn?
Skip?
-
You
work
for
Hooper?
I
work
for
the
Ann
How
do
you
know
about
Lacey?
I
interviewed
him
a
few
months
ago
Prick.
Follow
me.
Let
me
ask
you
something.
What
color
were
the
chairs
You
were
in
there
for
hours.
-
Green.
How
many
lights
are
there
A
Super
Soldier
wouldn't
have
to
look.
-
A
Super
Soldier?
He
would
know
He
could
walk
through
a
room
...how
many
power
outlets
People
are
walking
around
At
Level
One,
we
were
trained
to
-
What's,
uh,
what's
a
Jedi
Warrior?
-
You're
a
Jedi
Warrior?
I
don't...
I
don't
know
what
that
means.
I'm
Sergeant
First
Class
Lyn
Cassady,
In
the
eighties,
...under
a
secret
initiative
The
objective
of
the
project
Soldiers
with
super
powers.
We
were
the
first
generation
-
Youve
got
super
powers?
Wait
a
minute.
What
you
saying
is
that
you...
...were
a
Psychic
Spy,
like
Lacey?
We
prefer
the
term
"Remote
Viewer.
"
-
How
does
that
work?
Mel
Landau
used
to
visualize
packing
...to
clear
his
mind.
Steve
Cuttle
recite
Bible
verse
What
about
you?
I
find...
I
find
drinking
helps.
And
if
I'm
listening
to
-
Oh,
yeah?
Like
who?
What
other
powers
did
you
practice?
Invisibility.
-
Invisibility?
-
Like...
actual
invisibility?
Eventually,
we
adapted
it
to
just
But
once
you
understand,
the
linkage
between
observation
...then
you
begin
to
Like
camouflage?
No.
It's
not
like
camouflage.
We
also
practiced
Phasing.
Crossing
from
particle
to
wave,
Solid
objects
seem
to
pass
That
starts
with
a
breathing
exercise.
Then
you
think
black.
I
don't
know
what
the...
Can
I
be
honest
with
you,
Lyn?
I
don't
know
what
to
make
of
this.
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
I
wanna...
-
Could
I
write
a
story
about
this?
Because,
I've
been
looking
And
I
was
gonna
write
...but
this
is
much
better.
-
Not
gonna
happen.
I'm
shipping
out
tomorrow.
-
What?
You're
going
home?
I've
been
thinking
about
partnering
-
I
could
come.
-
I
could
come,
maybe...
-
I
don't
need
the
attention.
Look!
There's
a
war
over
there,
Bob!
War!
Now,
I
don't
have
to
be
You...
you
wouldn't
have...
I've
been
in
some
pretty
hairy
situations.
I'm
a
journalist,
Lyn.
A
journalist.
What
is
this?
Nothing.
I
was
just
doodling.
What's
the
matter?
Nothing.
The
U.S
Army
doesn't
really
have
...than
to
be
wonderful!
This
does
not
represent

the
United
States
Army
Bill
Django.
Who's
Bill
Django?
The
man
who
wrote
that
book.
He
said
it
all
started
when
he
Move
out!
Go!
Go!
Move!
Fuck
you
motherfucker!
-
Hey,
knock
it
off!
Chris!
Knock
it
off!
Will
you
knock
it
off?
Jesus!
-
Medic!
Alright!
What
are
you
waiting
for?
What
the
fuck!
Fire!
Every
single
one
of
Bill's
men
They
instinctively
hadn't
wanted
Later
Bill
would
come
across
a
study,
...only
15-20
percent
of
fresh
soldiers
The
rest
aimed
high,
...or
pretended
to
be

you,
sir.
I
got
you.

in
there.
Their
gentleness...
...is
their
strength.
While
recovering
in
the
hospital,
Bill
wrote
to
the
explaining
that
he
wanted
to
go
on
...to
explore
The
Pentagon
agreed
to
pay
What
Bill
hadn't
told
the
Pentagon
...was
that
he
was
really
looking
for
How
could
his
men's
gentleness,
...their
general
lack
of
interest
...be
turned
into
a
strength?
How
could
love
and
peace
Bill
knew
where
to
go
Bill
disappeared
into
the
Like
all
Shaman
before
him,
Now
he
was
returning
to
his
people,
He
brought
with
him
his

he
called:
"The
New

The

What's
the
Are
you
ready?
-
Got
it?
-
You
see
it?
You
got
it?
As
Lyn
drove
on,
I
wondered
I
wanted
to
go
back.
And
so
was
Lyn.
But,
by
then,
it
was
too
late.
What?
Does
that
direct
What?
The

Does
it
direct

No.
It
cooks

Utilizing
the

of

No

That's
New

technology.
Pretty
mind
blowing,
isn't
it?
First
time
I
saw
that,
-
What
the
fuck?
But
what?
It's
just
hard
to
believe
There's
nothing
in
here,
The
New
Earth
Army
was
We're
a
force
of
peace,
Bill
understood
...you've
got
to
start
He
was
the
guy
that
started
-
Non-lethals?
-
The
Predator.
Lyn,
that's
just
a
plastic...
You're
mine
now.
The
predator
is
100%
biodegradable.
It's
friendly
to
the
earth
Fuck!
It
has
warrior
capacities.
Jesus!
Stop
it!
-
I
bought
it
online.
The
funny
thing
is,
you
could
see
...and
you'd
never
know
Eyeballs.
Goddammit!
Well,
I
guess
it's
officially
night
now.
Piece's
a
shit.
I've
got
Crohn's.
Sometimes
there's
a
need,
Bob.
Sometimes
people
are
calling
...they
don't
even
know
And
then
a
man
like
Bill
...because
he
heard
the
call.
We
are
a
hollow
army,
gentlemen.
Vietnam
has
crushed
our
soul.
We
have
to
dream
a
new
America.
An
America
that
no
longer
has
an
No
longer
promotes
But
to
achieve
this
dream...
We
must
become
the
first
Superpower
We
must
create
Warrior
Monks.
Men
and
women
...sense
plant
auras,
...stop
saying
mindless
cliches
I
want
you
to
Be
all
you
can
be.
Amongst
Bills
audience
that
day
...from
the
Defense
Dean
Hopgood.
For
some
time,
the
General
...Soviet
research
According
to
some
stories,
...the
Soviets
had
designed
Machines
capable
of
bombarding
They
were
also
conducting
...to
see
whether
animals
Could
they,
for
instance,
...telepathically
detect
that
their
Sick
bastards.
But
when
did
the
Soviets
begin
Well,
sir...
It
looks
like
they
found
out
...telepathically
communicate
with
The
Nautilus,
while
it
was
-
What
attempt?
It
seems
the
story
But
the
Russians
think
...being
a
French
hoax
So,
they've
started
psi
research...
...because
they
thought
when
in
fact
we
Yes,
sir.
But
now
that
...we're
gonna
have
to

can't
afford
to
have

Lyn!?
Lyn?
Lyn!
What?
Nothing,
I...
-
What?
What
are
you
doing?
Alright.
We're
Oscar
Mike.
-
That's
"On
the
Move",
soldier.
What
are
you
doing?
Cloud
bursting.
-
Really?
Which
one?
-
What?
This
one?
Isn't
that
too
far
away?
They're
all
far
away.
And
it's
gone.
Jesus,
you
had
like
I'm
sorry
about
that
Bob.
Must
have
got
a
little
Don't
worry
it
though.
-
Heads.
-
Head.
-
What's
your
record
at
this?
Right.
Well,
that's
pretty...
Thank
you,
Jesus.
Please!
Please!
Can
you
help
us?
Can
you
help?
And
I
wonder,
if
you
could
...like
a
town
or
someplace?
Can
we...
we
get
in?
He
says
fattore.
We
can
get
in.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
for,
uh,
No

came
by.
How...
How
far
is...
Lyn?
-
Is
this...
We're
gonna
die.
We're
gonna
be
killed
by
Al
Qaeda.
-
I
don't
think
they're
Al
Qaeda.
You
don't
know.
You
don't
know!
This
is
all
your
fault!
Bob,
there's
something
When
I
said
that
I
was
retired
I'm
on
a
mission.
DeWitts
was
just
my
cover.
I
couldn't
tell
you
But
I
think
you
have
a
role
to
play.
You're
an
idiot.
You
know
why
I'm
here?
I
just
wanted
to
get
into
Iraq
...that
I
wasn't
a...
And
now
I'm
gonna
die.
I'm
gonna
die.
...fuckhead!
Bob,
have
you
ever
heard
of
What?
"Optimum
trajectory.
"
Your
life
is
like
a
river.
That
you're
aiming
for
a
goal
...you'll
always
gonna
be
swimming
Young

gonna

Little

Tough
titty
Anne.
But
you
will
go
on
to
move
Find
out
what
your
destiny
is
Now,
sometimes
events
in
life...
...give
an
individual
clues
Like
those
little
doodles
It's
the
Ajna
chakra,
The
symbol
of
the
Jedi.
When
I
saw
that
...the
Universe
gives
you
clues
You're
meant
to
be
here
with
me,
Bob.
It's
the
Jedi
in
you
Now,
I
don't
think
these
guys
...I
think
we're
talking
Which
means
they're
gonna
try
-
We
can't
let
that
happen.
There's
three
of
them!
We're
Jedi,
Bob.
We
don't
fight
with
guns.
What
do
you
mean?
Okay,
let's
say
that
we
have
no
choice
We
will
use
visual
aesthetics
...in
the
enemy
What
do
you
mean?
Okay,
you
pick
one
of
them
out,
...and
you
go
into
this
monotone
"I'm
not
going
to
attack
you.
"
You
relax
your
body
and
your
voice.
And
you
just
rip
out
Or
you
get
a
pen
you
create
this...
I
mean
a
real
fountain,
get
it
That
is
a
psychic
disincentive,
We
haven't
got
a
pen.
You're
missing
the
point.
Come
here.
Let
me
show
you
something.
-
Choke
me.
Choke
me.
I
don't
know...
It's
okay.
What's
with
the
quotation
fingers?
It's
like
saying,
I'm
only
capable
Choke
me!
Well,
if
I
choose
to
choke
you,
I'm
gonna
interrupt
your
See?
I
barely
moved.
Physics
wise,
It's
the
psychic
energy
that's
-
Sharp
edges.
-
You
felt
fear
though
in
the
beginning?
Would
you
say
that
level
of
fear
I
don't
know.
I
was
pretty
...but
the
fear
I
felt
on
the
run-up
You
know
why?
Because
it
wasn't
you.
I
was
inside
your
head.
-
Now,
you
must
always...
I'm
sorry
I
freaked
out
You
learned
a
lesson.

you
fear
most

the
fear

really
don't

was
just

No.

do
run

studio.
I
love
dancing.
And
you're
out
here
In
time,
Bob.
Did
you
mean
what
you
said
back
there
...I
had
some
Jedi
in
me?
We
learn
to
recognize
our
own
kind.
Haven't
you
always
felt
like
Yes.
Yes,
I
have.
That's
the
way
it
is
for
us.
We're

you
understand?
I'm
just
kidding
about
this
shit.
Okay,
what
shall
we
do
now,
uh?
Let's
dance.
Okay.
Give
it
everything
you've
got.
That's
it.
-
What's
your
first
name,
Cassady?
You've
gotta
free
your
feet
I'm
not
really
much
of
a
dancer,
sir.
That's
not
true,
is
it?
You
can
dance.
It's
just
someone
told
you
not
to.
Stop
acting
so
fucking
queer!
Well,
I'm
your
commanding
officer,
...let
the
dance
out!
Come
on,
dance!
Let
it
go!
Let
it
go!
That's
it!
Welcome
to
the
Heroes
Journey,
Lyn.
Okay
everyone,
remember,
And
remember,
Belgian
waffle,
ginseng
Not
to
be
abused,
There's
the
opening.
That's
it!
Yeah!

Think
cold!
Mother
Earth,
my
life
support
I
must
drink
your
blue
water,
...and
eat
your
green
skin.
Carry
my
body
through
You're
my
connection
to
the
Universe
I'm
yours
and
you
are
mine.
After
years
of
feeling
...Lyn
had
finally
found
a
home.
At
last
he
was
with
men
who
prided
Left

that's
it.
These
were
Golden
Days
for
Lyn.
There
was
something
so
noble
...that
the
Jedi's
felt
inspired
In
a
world
torn
apart
by

would
be
a
force
for
good,
For
the
first

Let
me
finish
this.
Larry
Hooper
was
a
failed
Sci-Fi

to
the
Jedi

him
at
a
Jesus!
You
did
this?
You
son
of
a...!
Right
from
the
start...
...he
had
made
himself
unpopular
Congratulations,
Scotty.
I'm
sorry
Larry
made
it
quite
clear
that
Hey,
man!
How'd
you
like
it
But
Lyn...
Fuck
off!
He
really
hated
him.
K-9.
Scotty?
It's...
-
It's
something
cylindrical?
It's
a
pencil?
This
is
Larry's
spirit
guide,
Maud.
I'm
looking
into
the
cupboard
now.
And
I
see...
I
see...
...a
tin
mug?
Lyn?
It's
a
man
sitting
on
a
chair.
No,
wait
a
minute.
-
He
said
A.
After
a
year's
training,
A
senior
NATO
General
had
been
kidnapped
Bill
was
unofficially
asked
...help
find
him
We're
north
of
Verona.
It's
a
small
town
near
a
lake.
I
can
see
a
cinema.
Across
the
street
from
the
cinema,
Or
it's
a...
it's
a
cafe.
He's
in
the
apartment
above
the
cafe.
The
name
of
the
town
is...
...it's
something
sweet.
Dolce.
The
name
of
the
town
is
Dolce.
Bill
had
never
encountered
anyone
And
from
that
moment
on,
Rank,
medals...
these
things
But
growth
in
spirit,
in
wisdom,
...these
are
things
Native
Americans
believed
that
...it
was
the
mark
of
love,
...and
ultimate
respect.
Only
true
human
beings
-
Way
to
go,
Lyn!
The
word
soon
got
out
in
the
...that
there
was
a
sergeant
...who
could
find
whatever
It
was
as
if
Lyn
could
fly
...without
leaving
his
room.
As
Bill
said:
the
Force
truly
was
strong
Lyn?
Don't
worry,
Bob.
You
don't
want
us.
You
don't
want
us!
Put
your
weapon
away.
Put
your
weapon
away.
Bob,
don't
move.
Put
your
weapon
away.
Bob,
stay
put!
La

Ana

Hold
it
right
there.
Now
at
the
time
I
thought
Later
I
discovered

performing

a
Vietnam
vet
He
remains
the
only
non-Korean

It's
been
said
he
could
have

not
move
an
inch.
He
was
also
able
to
lift
bags
...hung
through
his
scrotum.
He
was
one
of
the
Jedi
teachers
Sir,
what
is
the
practical
Ben
caused
quite
a
stir
..."shock
and
awe"
The
approach
was
hailed
by
some
but
criticized
by
others
who
believed
...might
lead
you
to
Lyn
Cassady,
however,
Of
course,
Lyn
didn't
actually
have
So,
I
still
think
that
...reckless.
Throw
your
hands
up!
You
idiot.
Shit!
Shit!
We're
okay.
We're
okay.
Oh,
shit!
There
he
is.
Sir,
it's
okay!
We're
here
to
help
you!
Sir!?
Sir,
will
you...
Oh,
crap!
-
What
happened?
What
happened?
Sir?
Are
you
alright,
sir?
Bob,
give
me
a
hand.
Come
on!
Help
him
up!
Bring
him
up!
Shit!
Shit!
Don't
move!
Let's
see
your
hands!

Ask
me
what
business
I'm
in,
Mahmud.
Right
now,
I'm

the
most
common
"I

That's
fucking
funny.
Okay,
we're
in

now.
We've

a

Negative.
We're

That's
bullshit.
With
all
due
respect,
sir,

Bullshit!
Can
we
figure
out

Where
is
the
shooter?
And
what
became
known
twelve
people
were
injured.
Both

it
was

Sounds
good,
Muhammad.
As
we
ran
for
cover,
I
was

a
mission,
...even
if
I
didn't
know
But
I
could
hear
He
was
screaming
Krom
One!
Krom
One!
We
are
under
attack.
This
is
fucking
fubar!
Muhammad
led
us

as
it
turned
out
And
also,
accidentally
Neighbors
told
him
that
...they
weren't
sure
I'm
very
sorry
It
was
an
accident.
And
I
apologize
for
that
I
don't
want
you
to
think
that
I
apologize
for
the
kidnappers.
Not
your
fault,
sir.
I

Are
you
awake?
I
was
just...
They're
just
trying
to
do
Something...

good.
But
there's
always
somebody
What
Lyn
was
really
thinking
And
the
part
he
had
played
in

in
fairness,
...hadn't

For

on
being

We

Continue
the
work,

The

now,
After

left,
Major
Holtz
of
Special

He
didn't
think
much
of
Bill's

he's
about

ever
the

I
really
appreciate
this,

Jesus!

You
can
use
a
wristwatch
in

-
Well,
what?
I
haven't
got
a
wristwatch.
Oh,
for
the
love
of...
Here.
What?
-
It's
digital.
You
need
a
watch
with
hands.
How
am
I
supposed
to
know?
You're
the
one
who
said
...find
a
way.
-
I'll,
if
you'd
just
be
quiet...
-
I
don't
need
a
watch.
I'm
using
Level
Two.

What
is
that?
We
were
trained
to
make
Somebody
runs
up
to
you...
...and
they
say
Do
we
go
left
or
do
we
go
right?
"We
go
right!"
-
What?
Just
instant?
We've
been
sitting
here
for
half
an
hour.
-
Oh,
it's
this
way?
Oh,
now
you
know.
Hang
on.
What
happened?
-
IED.
-
Improvised
Explosive
Device.
You're
okay.
I
can't
believe
it.
Great
fucking
intuition,
Lyn.
I
can't...
put
me
down.
Oh,
Jesus!
I
think
I
may
be
You're
not
bleeding
to
death.
It's
a
shock.
It's
hot.
-
Aren't
you
hot?
It's
really
important
You
can
lose
a
lot
of
water
If
we'd
only
stayed
with
the
car
...we
would
be
alright
now.
-
Now
we've
no
water,
no...
Would
you
stop
saying
that?
I've
been
got
blown
up!
-
I'm
not
gonna
be
okay.
If
you
panic,
Is
that
supposed
to
calm
me
down?
Wait
a
minute.
This
is
west.
Al
Qaim
is
the
other
way.
Al
Qaim
isn't
the
mission.
Where?
-
I
don't
know.
Is
that
a
joke?
We've

Who
gave
you
the
mission,
Lyn?
-
Bill
did
it.
Bill...
He
appeared
in
my
A
psychic
projection.
-
He
called
out
my
name.
Lyn,
there
is
no
mission.
We're
in
the
middle
of
the
fucking
desert
There's
no
one
here!
When
the
dust
of
Bill's
discharge
...it
revealed
a
surprising
victor.
What
you've
for
me,
sergeant?
This
is
a
scientific
report
...on
possible
offensive
I
showed
it
to
Lieutenant
Colonel
Django,
No,
I
bet
he
wasn't.
We
have
men
who
can
do
this?
I
can
think
of
one,
sir.
But
we
don't
have
the
resources.
Well,
sir...
...there
is
the
goat
lab.
Just
80
yards
from
Major
Holtz's
Most
of
the
soldiers
...had
no
idea
about

Because,
...the

was
not
empty.
The
goats
have
been
secretly
flown

worried
about

they'd
been
de-bleated.
Goat
Lab

originally
created
...to

gone,
Bob.
What?
I
can't
find

I've
lost
my
powers.
It's
a
curse.
What
curse?
They
took
this,
beautiful
thing
...and
they
destroyed

I

and

wanted

They
wanted
me
to

had

ever
done
to
me?
It
was
completely
against
I
was
just
gonna
pretend
to
try...
...so
that
they
can
see
it
wouldn't
work
Then,
as
I
sat
there...
I
felt
this...
pulse
...inside
me.
Maybe
deep
down
inside...
...some
dark
part
of
me
Holy
shit!
That
was
it.
...as
if
I
brought
a
curse
It's
like
that
poem
where...
...the
guy
kills
the
seagull
and
they
Every
night
I'd
dream
of
that
goat.
It's
mouth
opening
and
closing
The
silence
of
the
goats.
I
finished
my
tour
and
I
quit.
I
never
went
back.
But
before
he
could
leave,
Larry
arranged
one
last
parting
gift.
What
do
you...?
It
was
the
Dim
Mak.
-
The
Dim
Mak?
The
Quivering
Palm.
The
Death
Touch.
It's
forbidden
in
the
New
Earth
Army.
What
does
the
Death
Touch
do?
It
kills
you,
Bob.
-
With
one
touch.
There's
a
story
that
Wong
Wifu,
...had
a
fight
with
a
guy
Then
the
guy
gave
him
Wong
looked
at
him
That
was
it.
He
had
given
him
the
death
touch.
Wong
died.
Then
and
there?
No.
About
eighteen
years
later.
That's
the
thing
about
Dim
Mak...
...you
never
know
In
a
funny
kind
of
way
He
believed
in
something
...he
thought
he
could
That's
what
I've
been
looking
Something
to
believe
in.
Something
to
give
meaning
So
I
had
fallen
for

I'd
followed

It's

do?
It's

late...
-
I'm
dying,
Bob.
I
don't

Whatever.
It's

What?
All
I
know
it's

It's
cancer.
At
least
that's
what
the

said.
It's
different

Different
names
for
a

Give
that
to
Bill.
I
don't
deserve
it.
Take
it.
It
wasn't
the
Dim
Mak
And
it
wasn't
the
cancer.
He
was
dying
of
a
broken
heart.
And
maybe,
the
cancer
as
well.
His
mission
had
failed.
And
failure
was
something
Bill?
Lyn
told
me
he
didn't
deserve
He
wanted
me
to
-
It's
fake.
Twenty
thousand
dollar
fine
This
one's
off
a
turkey.
You
just
die
the

black.
Don't
tell
Lyn.
It
isn't
real.
None
of
it
was
real.
Lyn
told
me
about
the
curse.
That
by
killing
the
goat,
What's
Larry
gonna
do
Do
you
believe
in
redemption,
Bill?
Sorry.
How
did
you
find
it?
I
told
you,
Scotty
Mercer
told
you,
didn't
he?
Yeah,
he
did.
We
told
Scotty

him
I

That's
funny,

morning.
Mother
Earth,
As
a
soldier
...live
inside
your
red
clay
Help
me
to
balance
myself.
As
you
hold
in
balance,
...and
the
space
environments.
Help
me
to
open
my
heart...
...knowing
that
I
pray
my
boots
...and
my
footsteps
match
Carry
my
body
through
You're
my
connection
to
the
Universe
I'm
yours
and
you
are
mine.
I
salute
you.
I
salute
you.
Bill?
Bill!
Bill?
Bill?
Are
you
okay?
I
just
saw
Timothy
Leary.
Timothy
Leary
is
dead.
I
know.
He'd
got
an
idea.
Good
evening,
gentlemen.
Gonna
get
some
ice-cream.
Don't
eat
the
eggs.
-
What?
What's
going
on?
We
put
LSD
in
the
eggs.
Bill
showed
me
where
Larry
We
put
some
in
the
And
in
the
water.
What?
I
put
it
in
the
main
water
tank
But
we
drank
the
water.
Yeah.
Right.
Hold
on.
The
weather
today
is
gonna
be...
...hot.
I
mean,
yeah,
I
really
didn't
looked
...I'd
say
it's
gonna
be
Yeah.
What
else?
I
mean,
it's
a
fucking
shocker,
right?
It
would
have
been
a
good
idea
Well,
that
might
have
aroused
suspicion.
But
don't
worry.
I've
built
up
a
massive
tolerance
You're
going
to
hit
the
gates!
That's
cool!
In
the
name
of
the
New
Earth
Army
...I'm
liberating
you!
I'm
liberating
this
base!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Move!
Put
the
gun
down,
Larry.
No!
Wow,
I'm
really
hungry.
-
Come
on!
Come
with
me!
Don't
worry
about
this
guards.
Be
free!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Where
are
you
going?
You
are
the
mission,
Bob!
Tell
them
what
happened.
It's
your
job
now.
At
the
time
I
was
hurt
that
But
now
I
know,
...it
was
because
he
and
Bill
Nobody
exactly
knows
The
official
story
is
that
...either
because
they
were
hit
Well,
that's
what
happens...
...when
you
fly
a
helicopter
All
I
know
is
that
Like
all
Shaman,
When
I
got
back,
Everything.
Lyn
had
handed
a
mission
on
I
would
tell
everyone
I
understood
now
that...
...Debora
and
I
werent
...I
was
at
peace
with
that.
It
wasn't
in
my
destiny
to
return
The
Universe
has
other
plans
for
me.
I
sent
the
story
to
the
newspapers
I
didn't
care
what
the
authorities
I
was
ready
to
go
to
prison
But
they
didn't
put
me
in
prison.
They
did
something
much
worse.
...unusual
tool
to
break
...and
trust
me,
Some
prisoners
are
being
forced
...the
Purple
Dinosaur
...for
twenty
four
straight
hours.
And
that
was
it.
That
was
the
only
bit
of
my
story
And
it
was
a
joke.
And
if
I
ever
needed
proof
...taken
the
beautiful
dream
...and
had
twisted
it,
Well,
that
was
it.
But
I
won't
stop.
Because
when
I
look
at
what
is
I
know
that
now,
more
than
ever,
...we
need
to
be
Bob?
Now,
more
than
ever,
...we
need
the
Jedi.
