Northmen
had

of

I
was
with
Charlemagne's

Southern
Gaul.

as
we
sat
eating

a

of
pirates
attacked
the

soon.

at

I
have
something
for
you,

you

it
is

we

here,
we
could

know

have

is

to
myself,
but
to
all
of
you,
and
now
also
to
my
wife,
and
to
my
wife's
family.

I
have
to
do
something
about
this

I
blame
King
Horik

at
the
same
time,
consider
what
is
happening

has
abandoned
them
to

of

to
punish
those
who
have
insulted
me
and
my
family,
I
declare
today
that
I
will
seek
vengeance
against
Ragnar
Lothbrok.
By
all
our
gods,
I
swear
that
we
will
seize
all
his
lands
and
that
I
will
repay
with
the
axe.

of

regrets
your
attack
on
the

church
at

wonders
how
much
longer
you
intend
to
remain
in
his
kingdom?

Ragnar:
Well,
that
depends.
Bishop
Edmund:
Upon
what?
Ragnar:
Upon
what
he'll
or
what
he'll
offer
us
to
stay.
Stay?
Ragnar:
Yes,
we
want
to
Peace.

So
we
don't
have
to
kill
any
more
of
you.

will

your
message
to
the
king.
