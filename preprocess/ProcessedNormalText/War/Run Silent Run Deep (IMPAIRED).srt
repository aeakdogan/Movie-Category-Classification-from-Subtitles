Aye,
aye,
sir.
Boy,
that
skipper!
Let
me
tell
you,
he
knows
his
stuff.
That
was
amazing
!
Come
here,
you
guys.
Listen
to
this.
"Dear
Commander,
"Be
it
hereby
known
that
on
July
31,
1943,
"the
USS
Nerka,
under
the
"sunk
a
Japanese
destroyer."
-Be
quiet!
Signed,
Kraut
Mueller.
How
do
you
like
that,
Chief?
We've
been
drilling
Hey,
Ruby,
you
were
up
there,
huh?
Right
on
the
pickle,
dear
friend.
That
tin
can
zigs
right
into
us.
I
tell
you,
I
was
shaking.
What
about
the
old
man?
What
did
he
do?
Calm,
you
know
what
I
mean?
He
just
orders
two
fish
Just
like
you'd
order
ham
and
eggs.
If
we'd
missed,
though,
to
get
into
Area
7,
which
I
still
think
"If,
if,
if."
Go
back
to
Sears,
Roebuck,
Forgive
me
if
I
interrupt
the
music.
You
are
listening
once
again
speaking
to
you
from
the
heart
of
telling
you
in
your
own
It
has
been
substantiated
16
enemy
ships
this
month
alone.
Come
on,
Rosie,
You're
missing
one
Jap
tin
can
!
Jessie!
Jessie,
dear
friend.
We've
decided
to
be
big
about
it.
We're
not
going
to
We'll
take
back
the
money.
Gosh.
Well,
that's
nice
of
you
fellas,
but
my
conscience
hurt
me
so
much
Not
now,
Kohler.
Don't
shut
me
up
again,
Lieutenant.
I've
seen
all
kinds
of
captains.
But
I
never
saw
one
run
away
then
take
on
a
destroyer
with
a
shot
There
has
to
be
a
reason.
That
bow
shot
didn't
just
happen.
The
drills
were
planned
for
it.
The
whole
thing
was.
.
.
I
never
heard
of
a
bow
shot
being
set
up
where
it
wasn't
used
in
desperation.
It's
all
like
some
experiment!
Suppose
a
bow
shot
was
the
only
way
An
Akikaze
isn't
a
Momo.
This
Akikaze's
in
the
Bungo
Straits.
But
that's
impossible.
I
know.
Look,
I
know
how
you
feel
but
don't
you
think
We'll
be
hitting
Area
7
tomorrow
morning.
Four.
Five.
Six.
It's
a
convoy,
all
right,
sir.
Bearing
320,
relative.
Sounds
like
a
whole
lot
of
them,
sir.
Cullen.
Right,
sir.
I
have

Captain.

feet.

We're

sir.

We're

Captain.
What
firing
position
shall
we
take?
Captain?
Take
her
down,
sir?
Take
her
down
to
100
feet.
A
hundred
feet.
Aye,
aye,
sir.
Five-degree

Secure

Aye,
sir.
Come
right
to

-Coming
right
to

sir.
Mr.
Cartwright,
take
over
the
con.
Yes,
sir.
What's
he
doing?
What's
going
on?
Give
me
a
line
on
course
280.
-Sir?
Aye,
sir.
-What's
the
skipper
up
to?
-Start
leveling
off.
There
it
is.
You
might
as
well
post
it.
A
whole
area
to
patrol,
The
Bungo
Straits!
It's
the
only
place
we
can
get
the
Akikaze.
The
one
spot
You
make
it
sound
like
a
snap
decision.
It
wasn't,
Jim.
That's
quite
obvious
now,
sir.
Passing
a
Jap
submarine
jeopardizing
the
whole
boat
ducking
a
convoy
You
planned
it,
all
right.
And
you
knew
it
the
day
I
knew
it
before
that,
Jim.
I
knew
it
a
year
ago,
We
have
operational
orders.
We
have
a
crew
that
expects
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
if
he
feels
he
has
an
advantage.
What
advantage?
You
just
named
it!
A
bow
shot!
We
proved
we
could
do
it
with
a
Momo.
You
call
that
an
advantage
when
there
are
that
never
even
had
a
chance
to
shoot?
They
were
detected.
Not
even
Pearl
knows
where
we
are.
And
what
about
the
Japanese
Navy?
No,
sir.
But
you're
not
the
captain.
If
you
should
fail
there
won't
be
a
desk
That's
strange,
Jim.
I
never
even
thought
of
failing.
You've
got
a
lot
of
guts,
sir,
with
other
people's
lives.
That's
my
decision
and
my
responsibility.
To
whom,
sir?
Yes!
To
a
dead
crew,
a
dead
sub!
Now,
believe
what
you
want.
Well,
this
crew's
still
alive.
They
at
least
Do
I
have
to
tell
them?
What's
the
matter,
Captain?
Surely
you've
got
guts
enough
for
this,
too.
This
is
the
Captain.
Due
to
conditions
of
special
advantage,
I
have
decided
Bungo

broad

the

beam.
We're

Bungo

We're

We're

We're

If
I'd
only
been
born
on
the
eighth.
See
you
a
moment,
sir?
-What
is
this?
We
want
to
talk
to
you,
Jim.
I've
been
looking
We
want
you
to
take
over.
Well,
that's
very
flattering,
gentlemen.
Let's
go.
Everyone
outside.
We're
talking
about
Navy
orders!
-What
right
does
he
got
to.
.
.
That's
all
he
needs.
We
might
as
well
We're
going
to
follow
his
orders.
Where?
To
the
bottom?
If
that's
what
he's
got
in
This
boat,
any
boat,
has
one
captain.
Is
that
right,
Kohler?
Yes,
sir.
Is
that
right,
Mr.
Cartwright?
Yes,
sir.
Let's
break
this
up.
Mr.
Cartwright?
With
all
due
respect
to
your
rank,
may
I
say
that
I
think
you're
an
ass?
I
see
by
this
report
-Yes,
sir.
That's
right,
sir.
Mueller,
you're
a
damn
fool.
Yes,
sir.
I
know
it.
But
as
long
as
I
overheard,
They
wanted
Mr.
Bledsoe
to
take
over.
Well,
he
put
an
end
to
that
fast.
He
would.
Would
you
tell
me
something,
Mueller?
If
I
can,
sir.
Am
I
a
damn
fool,
too?
Sir?
Well,
Mr.
Bledsoe
seems
to
think
I
am,
and
I
have
a
great
respect
for
his
opinion.
Well,
maybe
you
have
to
be,
Look,
sir,
Why
not
the
Akikaze?
The
Akikaze
never
misses,
Mueller.
Never.
Well,
he
will
this
time,
sir.
Is
that
a
classified
opinion,
It's
a
fact,
sir.
A
fact
they'll
all
realize

we
going

No,

You
could

There!
-The

She'll

Look

Not

Start

-We'll
give
you
a

on
her.
-Right
standard

Very
well.
This
is
the
Captain.
The
convoy
we've
been
waiting
The
plan
of
attack
is
as
follows.
First,
we'll
strike
a
freighter
going
in.
If
that
doesn't
bring
the
Akikaze
toward
us,
we'll
attack
the
freighter
nearest
him.
When
the
Akikaze
does
head
toward
us,
we'll
dive
and
just
like
the
Momo.
Let's
go.
All

to

Captain,

I

What's

It's

Captain.
The

It's

Clear

Okay,

Come

On

Let's

fellas.
What
is
it,
sir?
I
can't

What
is
it,
sir?
I
can't
make
that
out.
What
is
it,
sir?
I
can't
make
that
out.
Here.
Better
take
a
swallow,
sir.
What
is
it?
A
stimulant,
Captain,
It's
100
proof,
sir.
How
long
have
I
been
out?
-Just
a
few
minutes,
Captain.
No.
You'd
better
worry
about
yourself,
sir.
You're
gonna
be
in
for
a
pretty
rough
time.
Please,
Captain.
You've
had
a
pretty
bad
concussion.
It's
worse
than
that.
There's
a
long
medical
term
for
it,
but
it
all
adds
up
for
quite
a
while.
If
you
don't
keep
off
your
feet,
sir,
you're
gonna
be
blacking
out
permanently.
You'll
keep
this
to
yourselves.
-But,
sir,
in
my
report.
.
.
Send
for
Mr.
Bledsoe.
Well?
Go
on
!
Yes,
sir.
The
torpedo
firing
circuits
We'll
have
to
set
up
a
jury-rig
for
the
radio,
and
the
radar
needs
some
work,
too.
That's
another
24
hours.
That's
not
bad,
considering.
We'll
lay
over
for
two
days
and
then
we
can
get
moving,
huh?
Yeah.
The
timing's
perfect.
Those
convoys
come
out
every
48
hours.
You
really
got
shook
up,
didn't
you?
No.
No,
I
couldn't
feel
better.
Then
maybe
I
didn't
hear
you
right.
You
heard
me
right.
I'm
talking
about
the
Straits,
going
back
to
the
Bungo
Straits.
We're
through
playing
with
lives,
Captain.
This
boat's
had
it.
It's
the
end
of
the
line.
Why?
Because
a
torpedo
went
wild?
You
know
yourself
that's
100-to-1.
The
whole
Japanese
Air
Force,
dropping
everything
it's
got.
That's
an
accident,
too?
The
next
time
around,
we'll
make
it.
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Swim
back
to
the
Straits

Yes,
sir?
Mr.
Cartwright,

Let's

Why,
they

How
could

Does
it

I
think
so,
sir.
You
think
so?
Well,
I
can't

for

Mr.
Bledsoe.
Did
you
dump
any

Yes,
sir.
What
have
I
done
now?
How
do
you
feel?
I'm
all
right.
Repairs
are
completed.
The

must
be
very
happy.
Aren't
you?
That's
what
you
wanted,
isn't
it?
It's
what
I
wanted.
I
see.
You're
going
back
to
the
Straits.
That's
right.
What
changed
your
mind?
I
found
out
how
they
detected
us.
Those

along
the

have
been
