These
are
the
true
events
of
November
A
place
our
country
does
not
remember,
This
story
is
a
testament
to
the
Americans
and
a
tribute
to
the
People's
Army
To
tell
this
story,
But
where
does
it
begin?
Maybe
in
June
of
1954,
when
French
Group
Mobile
100
where
we
would
go
eleven
years
later.


A
couvert!
Gardez
votres
positions!
A
derriere!
Feu
a
volonte!
A
derriere!



Maybe
this
story
begins
in
America,
when
the
Army
first
realised
a
new
kind
The
White
House
wants
a
victory
-
They've
already
beaten
the
French
Army.
The
French
Army?
What's
that?
The
problem
in
Vietnam
is
terrain.
Jungle,
rivers
-
manoeuvre
is
a
nightmare.
That's
why
we
want
to
use
helicopters.
-
They
want
you
to
test
the
idea.
I
know
a
young
Lt
Colonel
He
led
a
combat
company
in
Korea,
Experimental
parachutes?
#..The
other
side
of
the
mountain
#
Was
all
that
he
could
see,
#
The
other
side
of
the
mountain
#
Was
all
that
he
could
see
#
The
bear
went
over
the
mountain
#
The
bear
went
over
the
mountain,
How
about
we
go
back
to
Bingo?
#
B-I-N-G-O,
B-I-N-G-O
#
B-I-N-G-O
Tom?
How
much
do
you
know
He
was
in
Korea.
Has
a
Masters
Harvard?
He's
not
Hal
Moore?


Come
on,
Too
Tall,
Oh!
Did
you
see
that,
sports
fans?
Did
you
see
that?
I'm
going
to
the
moon!
-
Get
up
there.
No,
he's
not.
You're
out,
Snakeshit!
You're
out!
Horseshit!
I
believe
you're
out.
-
You're
a
pilot?
-
Yeah.
I
can
see
that.
-
Can
I
speak
to
you
for
a
minute,
Crandall?
-
Out.
-
Out.
-
Can
I
buy
you
a
drink?
So
your
men
call
you
Snakeshit?
It's
an
affectionate
appellation
I
fly
lower
than
snake
shit.
Well,
I
got
a
problem,
Snakeshit,
I've
never
been
called
a
solution.
You
know
what
Air
Cavalry
really
means?
You
fly
into
hostile
territory,
outnumbered,
The
battleground's
the
size
and
if
the
choppers
stop
coming,
I
figure
chopper
pilots
won't
fly
into
hell
I
know,
sir.
Why
us?
Well,
your
guys
look
like
shit,
Yesterday
you
didn't
have
to
train,
And
you've
got
pilots
like
Too
Tall.
They
want
to
fly
with
you
for
some
reason.
It's
because
I
only
recruit
the
dumb
ones,
sir.
I
suppose
I
have
a
choice
in
all
this?
You
sure
don't.
I
wouldn't
miss
it
for
the
world.
To
the
Air
Cav.
-
Good
morning,
Sergeant
Major.
Group!
Attention!
At
ease,
gentlemen.
Welcome
to
the
new
cavalry.
We
will
ride
into
battle.
And
this
will
be
our
horse.
You
don't
have
to
catch
it.
But
I
can
assure
you
nor
your
status
as
officers...
will
keep
you
above
the
danger.
Sergeant
Major
Plumley
and
I
where
the
officer
is
always
Because
to
follow
your
instincts
you
have
to
be
with
them
Sergeant
Major
Plumley
made
all
four
during
World
War
Two
-
plus
one
more
in
Korea.
He
answers
to
me
and
to
me
alone.
Now,
I
hope
you
gentlemen
like
training
because
me
and
the
Sergeant
Major...
we
love
it.
Three
strikes
and
you're
not
out!
There
is
always
one
more
thing
you
can
do.
-
Come
on,
boys.
-
Two...
Three.
-
Pretty
good,
huh?
There's
only
one
thing
wrong.
Be
sharp!
We
will
be
the
best
platoon
Be
ready
in
there!
Let's
go!
Let's
go!
All
right!
Your
officer's
dead!
All
right.
He
hesitated,
he's
dead.
-
Get
off
the
chopper.
All
right.
All
officers.
Come
on
in.
Savage,
you
learn
the
job
and
you
teach
your
job
-
That
goes
for
every
man.
Understood?
We'll
be
landing
under
fire,
gentlemen.
Men
will
die.

Have
you
said
your
prayers?
-
No?
I'll
say
them
with
you.
Fall
in.
All
right.
Ready,
set?
In
the
name
of
the
Father,
the
Son
Hail
Mary,
full
of
grace,
the
Lord
is
with
thee.
Blessed
art
thou
amongst
women
Holy
Mary,
Mother
of
God,
pray
for
us...
I
don't
want
to
be
a
Catholic.
You
do?
-
Why
is
that,
honey?
-
That's
a
sin!
God
just
made
you
hard-headed.
Um,
I'll
tell
you
what.
You
want
to
pray
-
Yes,
sir.
Hail
Mary,
full
of
grace.
The
Lord
is
with
thee.
Blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
blessed

I
can
hear
you
laughing
even
in
here.
I'm
not
laughing,
I'm
marvelling.
Marvelling
about
what?
You
find
stubbornness
in
your
children
-
Oh,
yeah?
I'll
give
you
something
to
marvel
at.
Sshh!
The
children...
When
I
pray...whatever
I
want...
I
thank
God
for
you.
-
Beautiful
morning,
Sergeant
Major.
Look
what
I
found

They've
sent
us
Real
green.
Gotta
train
them
up.
Must
be
thinking
of
starting
a
new
unit.
They
sent
new
rifles
too
-
the
M-16.
-
It's
supposed
to
be
a
good
weapon.
Feels
like
a
BB
gun
to
me.
-
You
think
we'll
get
close
enough
for
that?
A
leader
must
remain
cool
and
calm.
He
must
learn
to
ignore
explosions,
the
screams
of
the
wounded.
This
is
normal
on
a
battlefield.
Normal.

Colonel,
you
need
to
get
a
company
over
-
Where
the
hell's
that
coming
from?
The
radio's
picking
up
atmospheric
bounce.


When
Crazy
Horse
was
a
baby...
he
nursed
from
the
breast
The
Sioux
raised
their
children
that
way.
Every
warrior
called
every
woman
in
the
tribe
every
older
warrior
they
called
"Grandfather".
The
point
here
is
they
fought
as
a
family.
Take
care
of
your
men.
Teach
them
to
take
care
of
each
other...
'cause
when
this
starts,
-
Did
you
tune
that
in?
That's
fine.
You're
my
radio
operator.
-
I...
Any
of
you
sons-of-bitches
I'll
kill
you.
Godboldt,
take
your
boots
off.
Go
on.
Everybody,
take
your
boots
off.
Everybody.
Socks
too.
I
want
you
to
draw
fresh
socks
from
supply
and
keep
your
feet
dusted
with
powder.
Everybody
check
each
other's
feet
-
Now,
that
young
man's
a
leader.
But
that
other
fella
-
that
big
strong
one
there.
He's
eager.
Ladies.
I'm
really
glad
you're
here
today.
I
know
that
some
of
you
are
new
to
the
Army
so
I
thought
we
could
pool
our
resources
Why
don't
we
start
If
the
commissary
is
out
of
something,
I
tried
Big
Star
and
it's
OK.
But
I
keep
thinking
my
water's
going
to
break
That
takes
care
of
food
shopping.
The
washing
machines
don't
work.
-
I'll
take
care
of
that.
Well,
we'll
just
go
to
the
General.
The
laundromat
in
town's
OK,
but
they
-
In
a
public
laundromat?
but
they
have
a
sign
in
the
window
saying
-
What?
That's
awful.
Your
husband
is
wearing
to
say
that
his
laundry's
not
good
enough,
-
I'm
sorry.
I...
I
know
what
my
husband's
fighting
for
My
husband
will
never
ask
for
respect,
and
he'll
give
respect
to
no
man
The
rest
of
his
family's
the
same
way.
They
can
keep
their
goddamn
because
my
baby's
clothes
are
clean
Well,
I
guess
that
takes
care
-
Are
you
all
right?
OK.
OK.
We're
all
calm.
We're
all
calm.
A
car!

-
Colonel.
I
heard
my
new
Lieutenant's
-
Thank
you,
sir.
No,
no,
it's
fine.
It's
all
right.
Please.
-
How's
your
wife?
She's
sleeping.
So
is
my
daughter.
I
just
wanted
to
be
here
for
a
while
-
This
her
tag?
What's
this
say?
Don't
you
take
that
off.
That's
an
order.
-
Colonel,
may
I
ask
you
a
question?
What
do
you
think
I
hope
that
being
good
at
the
one
Why?
What
about
you?
I
don't
know,
sir.
Between
college
and
here,
We
helped
build
a
school
for
orphans.
They
were
orphans
because
the
warlord
I
know
God
has
a
plan
for
me.
I
just
hope
it's
to
help
protect
orphans...
not
make
any.
Well,
why
don't
we
ask
him?
Come
on,
let's
go
ask
him.
Our
Father
in
Heaven,
every
soldier
among
us
will
approach
you
Our
enemies
too,
according
to
their
own
understanding,
And
so
we
bow
before
your
infinite
wisdom.
I
pray
you
watch
over
the
young
men
that
I
lead
into
battle.
You
use
me
as
your
instrument
Especially
if
they're
men
deserving
of
a
future
in
your
blessing
-
Amen.
Oh!
Yes,
and
one
more
thing,
dear
Lord.
About
our
enemies...
ignore
their
heathen
prayers
and
help
us
Amen
again.
There's
the
one
about
the
kid
-
the
fairytales
with
the
deer
and
stuff.
-
Yes?
War
is
um...
Well,
it's...
It's
something
that
shouldn't
happen,
And
er...
And
it's
when
some
people
try
to
take
the
lives
of
other
people.
And
then
soldiers
like
your
daddy
have
to...
Are
they
gonna
try
to
take
your
life
away,
Well,
yes,
Cecile,
they're
gonna
try,
but
I'm
not
gonna
let
them.

Can't
sleep?
No.
The
men
are
so
young
and
now
And
when
I
look
at
them,
I
see
our
boys.
Then
you're
just
the
man
to
lead
them.
I
guess.

We
intend
to
convince
the
Communist
that
we
cannot
be
defeated
by
force
of
arms.
I
have
asked
the
commanding
general,
what
more
he
needs
to
meet
He
has
told
me.
And
we
will
meet
his
needs.
I
have
today
ordered
to
Vietnam
the
Air
which
will
raise
our
fighting
strength
to
125,000
men
almost
immediately.
Additional
forces
will
be
needed
later
Get
out
your
best
dresses,
ladies.
They're
going
to
want
to
celebrate.

#
Don't
you
ever
be
scared
#
Lean
on
me...
#
The
President
didn't
say
State
of
Emergency.
No,
he
didn't.
Without
that
our
enlistments
I'm
sorry,
Hal.
Forgive
me,
sir,
but
let
me
get
this
straight.
We
form
a
division
using
techniques
against
an
enemy
with
20
years
twelve
thousand
miles
away
from
our
ground.
And
right
before
the
Army
sends
us
into
-
The
most
experienced
third.
I
don't
know,
sir.
You
saw
this
coming,
didn't
you?
Yes.
That's
why
you
gave
me
Korea
didn't
teach
them
anything.
-
Politicians?
#
Hold
me,
hold
me
#
Never
let
me
go
#
Until
you're
told
me,
told
me
#
What
I
want
to
know
#
Make
me
tell
you
I'm
in
love
with
you
#
Thrill
me,
thrill
me...
#
Thank
you,
sir.
By
the
way,
Hal,
since
we're
being
deployed,
You're
the
commanding
officer
of
the
First
The
Seventh?
Thank
you,
sir.
#
Don't
be
fooled,
#
But
they
never
stood
#
When
you
take
me
in
your
arms
#
Kiss
me,
kiss
me
#
And
when
you
do
I
know
#
Miss
me
#
If
we
ever
say
"Adieu",
#
Let
me
tell
me
I'm
in
love
with
you
#
Kiss
me,
kiss
me,
when
you
do
I
know
Look
around
you.
In
the
Seventh
Cavalry,
we've
got
a
captain
Another
from
Puerto
Rico.
We've
got
Japanese,
Chinese,
Blacks,
Hispanics,
Cherokee
Indians.
Jews
and
Gentiles.
All
American.
Now,
here
in
the
States,
may
experience
discrimination
But
for
you
and
me
now,
all
that
is
gone.
We're
moving
where
you
will
watch
the
back
of
the
man
And
you
won't
care
what
colour
he
is
or
by
what
name
he
calls
God.
They
say
we're
leaving
home.
We're
going
to
what
home
So
let
us
understand
the
situation.
We
are
going
into
battle
I
can't
promise
you
But
this
I
swear...
before
you
and
before
almighty
God
that
when
we
go
into
battle,
and
I
will
be
the
last
to
step
off...
and
I
will
leave
no
one
behind.
Dead
or
alive...
we
will
all
come
home
together.
So
help
me
God.
I
love
you.

-
Hal.
Last
night,
the
enemy
hit
our
camp
-
How
many
casualties?
The
enemy
withdrew
towards
-
How
many
men
do
you
have
battle
ready?
395,
sir.
Exactly.
What
do
you
estimate
the
enemy
strength?
We
appraise
their
numbers
as
manageable.
-
You
have
no
idea.
Simple
orders,
Hal.
They
attack
us
-
no
casualties
-
Naturally,
we
chase
them,
of
course.
Does
it
smell
like
an
ambush
to
you?
If
they're
close
enough
to
kill
us,
Round
trip
a
chopper,
30
minutes.
That
means
the
first
60
men
on
the
ground
Son-of-a-bitch.
I
think
maybe
When
the
time
comes
I
need
one,
sir,
Well,
let's
go
do
what
we
came
here
to
do.
Yes,
sir.
Carry
on!

November
14th
1965.
Before
that
day,
the
soldiers
had
never
met
each
other
in
a
maajor
battle.
Two
mi
les
out.
Droppi
ng

of
the
earth.


First
Platoon,
let's
move.
It's
a
scout!
Let's
take
him
prisoner!
Lieutenant!
There
he
goes!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Captain,
keep
in
contact
Hey,
hey...
I
got
something
here.
I
got
a
boy!
Hell,
that
ain't
no
boy.

-
He
say
he
deserter.
Ask
him
where
his
friends
are.
He
say
this
is
base
camp
for
whole
division.
Where?
That
mountain.
The
same
army
that
destroyed
French.
Just
not
been
able
to
find
any
yet.
Captain
Metsker,
tell
the
patrols

You,
take
the
radio.

-
Sir...
Captain,
call
in
all
the
patrols.
We
have
to
engage

enemy
Net

-
Grab

wounded,
we'll
make
a
run...
We
gotta
get
out
of
here!
Stay
down!
Don't
anybody
move!

You're
gonna
be
OK.
Stay
down.
Form
a
perimeter!
What's
happening
with
those
patrols?

Hey!
Hey!
Calm
down!
Understand
the
situation
Pull

Alert

Agent

Six,

You're

Repeat.
We
are

No

This
is
Too
Tall.
We
hear
you.
Roger

Herrick's
platoon
is
cut
off
and
under

They're
gonna
try

flank
us.
Move!
-
We
gotta
go.
Move!
Savage.
Savage.
All
right.
I
got
you.
-
D-d-d...
Don't
let
them
get
the
signals
codes.
Roger

sir.
I'm
glad
I
could
die
for

They're

It's

Yes,
sir!
Follow
me!
Doc,
the

That
creek
bed
is
vital.
Vital!
Now,
they'll
be
coming
right
at
you.

I
repeat,
do
not
let
them

Secure
the

Tom,

Medevac
Commander,
are
you

Yeah.
You
can
make
it.
Copy

Get

Get

Come

Come

They're
still
trying
to
flank
us.
Radio!
Trojan
Six,
we're
in
heavy
contact.
If
they
get
the
LZ,
we've
had
it.
Can
you
hold?
We're
spread
thin,
sir,
but
we'll
give
'em
hell.

Crandall,
this
is
Troajan

It's
too
hot

You
copy

Too
Tall?
All
Seventh

A
whole

Losing
a
lot
of
draftees
is
a
bad
week.
Moore
is
still
fighting.
He's
against
more
men
than
he
can
count.
They're
not
lost.
Then
they're
lost.
-
Sergeant
Major!
We
need
to
carve
out
an
emergency
LZ
-
Sir.
Fire

the
hole!
Colonel,

Out.
It's
Brigade
Headquarters,
they
want
you
out.
-
We
can't
get
out,
damnit!
Saigon
wants
to
debrief
you.
That
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Say
again.
Will
you
repeat
that
order?
Too
Tall,
follow
the
Colonel
to
the
new
LZ.
I
see
him,

Yeah.
We're

up
a
little.
No.
We're

Agent

Does
anybody

Ernie,

You

Our

Yeah.
Plug

it's
closed.
This

I'm

Crandall's

I

more?
Yes,

Hey,
what
are
those
lights
down
there?
Enemy
soldiers.
They're
moving
into

Here

Help

Your

That's

Colonel,

Who
the

are
you?
-
Hell.
We've
been
flat
to
the
boards.
We
got
more
enemy
coming,
sir.
-
Is
that
so?
-
Well,
I
can't
guarantee
your
safety.
-
Where
are
you
from,
son?
That's
the
first
thing
I
heard
all
day

Captain
Dillon!
-
Did
you
see
those

-
You

You

into
a
hot
LZ.
Don't
you
play
hotshot
with
me!
Do
it
again,
I'll
have
you
busted!
You
got
the
balls
to
face
me,
Whoa!
Hey!
Whoa!
If
I
ever
see
you
again,
I'll
kill
you.
That's
right.
Hey.
What
a
day,
huh?
Tomorrow
will
be
worse.
If
they
make
it
to
tomorrow.


Ernie,
I
can
smell
them.
-
Dead
bodies
stink.
I

Captain,
if
you
guys
are
coming,
I
don't
want
to
shoot
any
of
our
guys.
Copy?
Savage,
we
can't
make
it
tonight.
Don't
worry.
You're
gonna
make
it.
We'll
come
get
you
in
the
morning.
Yes,
sir.
Out.
Hey,
you're
doing
a
fine
job,
son.
Don't
worry.
We
gave
them
more
than
they
gave
us
today.
How
you
boys
doing?
Keep
on
doing
Your
men
have
done
a
hell
of
a
job
today,
They
won't
get
through,
sir.
I
know
that,
Jack.
Keep
it
up,
son.
It's
Rear
Headquarters.

How
is
it,
Colonel?
Sir,
I
need
a
confirmed
count
-
I've
got
to
know
where
all
my
boys
are.
-
Here
they

Yes.
I

I

ma'am.
I'm

Wait.
Wait.
I'll

Tell

No

Cab

The

I'll
go
with
you.
-
Thanks.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
No!
I
thought
she
would
hate
me.
Your
husband
didn't
start
the
war.
They

-
I'll
take
care
of
this.
We'll
do

We

OK?
Julie.
Do
you

If
there

come
and
get
me.
In
the

Out
of
the
depths
I
cry
to
thee,
O
Lord.
Let
thy
voice
be
attentive
Thou,
O
Lord,
shall
mark
our
iniquities.
Lord,
who
can
abide
them?
With
thee
there
is
mercy.
Grant
them
eternal
rest,
O
Lord,
Through
the
mercy
of
God,
In
the
name
of
the

-
You
got
a
death
wish,
Galloway?
Well,
why
are
you
here?
I
knew
these
dead
boys
would
be
here,
sir.
Why
aren't
you
a
soldier?
My
daddy
was
a
soldier.
My
grand-daddy.
Two
of
my
great
grand-daddies
were
soldiers.
Each
of
them
lost
a
leg
in
the
Civil
War.
My
great
grand-daddy
Galloway
lost
his
left
They
met
in
a
shoe
store
in
Galveston.
Every
year
after
that,
the
same
date,
they'd
get
together
-
You
are
shitting
me?
Anyway,
one
had
a
daughter,
one
had
a
son
-
What
the
hell
were
the
odds
of
them
I
don't
know,
Colonel.
Yeah.
Meant
to
be.
Galloways
have
been
in
every
war
But
when
it
came
to
this
one,
I
just
thought
maybe
I
might
try
Maybe
help
the
folks
back
home
understand.
I
just
figured
I
could
do
that
better
Well...
I
sure
hope
you
make
it
through
this
one.
You
too,
Colonel.

Aagh!
Right

Put
it

Go
back

mound.
You'll
be
fine.
All

Pass
the
word
on.
Every
man
fires
three
rounds
on
anything
They're
gonna
hit
us
like
this

We
gotta
get

that
mound.
Shit!

Sir,
they're

us
all
out.
All
of
us.
They're
going
to
march

They
don't

He's

The

Then
he'll
get
his

Requesting

All

Carry

Sir,
Custer

You
ain't.
Goddamn.
Hell...
Right
now
they're

Sir,
I
don't...

You
tell

You
tell

"With

We
who
have
seen
war
In
the
silence
of
the
night,
So
this
is
our
story.
For
we
were
soldiers
once...and
young.

To

soldiers
let
us
sing
#
Where
no
rockets
fly
nor
bullets
wing
#
Our
broken
brothers
let
us
bring
#
To
the
Mansions
of
the
Lord
#
No
more
bleeding,
no
more
fight
#
No
prayers
pleading
through
the
night
#
Just
divine
embrace,
eternal
light
#
In
the
Mansions
of
the
Lord
#
Where
no
mothers
cry
#
We
shall
stand
and
guard
#
While
through
the
ages
safely
keep
#
The
Mansions
of
the
Lord
