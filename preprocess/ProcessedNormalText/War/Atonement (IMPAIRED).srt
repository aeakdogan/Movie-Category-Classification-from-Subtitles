Have
you

Well,

-Hello,
pal,
I
hear
you're
putting
on
a
play.
Jungle
drums.
-Will
you
come
and
see
it?
Why
don't
you
let
me
read
it?
You
used
to
make
me

-I've
kept

-Let's
see.
Mummy,
I
need
you!

It's

Well,

run
off

I

have
written

-Cee.
Why
don't
you
talk
to
Robbie
any
more?
I
do.

-Do
we
have
to
do
a
play?
-It's
to
celebrate
my
brother
Leon's
visit.
-JACKSON:
So
do
l.
-It's
just
showing
off.
-And
I'll
tell
the
parents.
We're
guests
in
this
house.
And
what
did
-Well,
Pierrot?
-Jackson?
Amenable,
that's
right.
Now,
Briony,
what's
your
play
about?
Well,
it's
about
how
love
is
all
very
well,
-I
suppose
you're
going
to
be
Arabella.
-In
that
case,
do
you
mind
if
I
play
her?
Do
say
yes.
It'd
be
the
first
decent
thing
Well,
yes,
all
right.
I
suppose
we
should
start
by
reading
it.
If
you're
going
to
be
Arabella,
then
I'll
be
Sorry.
I'm
going
to
do
the
prologue.
"Prologue.
"This
is
the
tale

with

fellow.
"It
grieved

see
their

Yes?
-Nothing.
Just
thought
I'd
watch.
You
can
see
the
play
this
evening.
-I'll
have
to
work
then.
JACKSON:
Can
we
go
for
a
swim
now?
-No,
I
don't
really
think
there's
time!
I'm
sure

half-hour
break
PIERROT:
Cecilia?
Cecilia!
Cecilia!





Cecilia!
Cecilia,

Yes,
I
don't
see
why

you

Beautiful

-Are
you
enjoying
your

It
gets
better.
I

-Leon's
coming
down
today,
did
you
know?
He's
bringing
a
friend
with
him.
-Are
the
flowers
for
him?
Leon
says
he's
very
charming.
The
Old

telephoned

night.
-I'm
thinking
about
it,
yes.
-How
else
do
you
become
a
doctor?
-couldn't
you?
With
your
First?
I
said
I'd
pay
your
father
back.
That's
not
what
I
meant
at
all.
-Let
me
help
with
that.
-Take
the
flowers.
Take
the
flowers.
Oh,
you
idiot.
Do
you
realise
that's

Not
any

LEON:
Hello,
Robbie!
No
need
to
encourage
him.
Cee?
Mother?
-Where

everyone,
Danny?
DANNY:
Sir.
-Will
you
have
one?
-Whisky?
-Leon!
CECILIA:
Oh,
I've
missed
you.
-This
is
my
sister,
Cecilia.

-Likewise.
In

I'm
not

with

It's

next
to
the

Is

Old
Man
staying
in
town?
LEON:
Looks
like
it.

PIERROT:
So
aren't
we
doing
the
play?
-JACKSON:
Why
not?
PIERROT:
I
don't
like
it
here.

-When
can

go

We
can't

It's

-How
dare
you
say

JACKSON:
Do

Well,
I've

exactly
have
you
read

I'll
thank

Your

quite
clear,

ROBBIE:
Dear
Cecilia,
you'd
be
forgiven
the
way
I
acted
this
afternoon.
The
truth
is
I
feel
rather
lightheaded
and
I
don't
think
I
can
blame

"Will
you
forgive
me?

Off
out
then?
ROBBIE:
Yes,
Leon's
asked
me
So
that's
why
I've
been
polishing
I'll
think
of
you
when
I
see
my
face
You're
not
a
bit
like
your
father.
That's
because
I'm
all
yours.
I'll
be
late.
Your

are
hanging
upstairs.
-Son.
Nothing.
Briony!
Is
that
you?
Are
you
all
right?
Do
you

you
could
do
me
a
favour?
Could
you
run
ahead

a
bit
of
a
fool

it
over

Briony.
Briony!

suppose
he's
what
you
might
call
eligible.
He
certainly
seems
to
think

is
odd,
considering
he
has
pubic
hair
I
should
imagine
he'd
give
you

quite
a
good

actually.

CECILIA:

even
better,

you
read

letter?
-Briony!
I
insist
you
try
it.
Wasn't
there
an
envelope?

Do
you
mind
if
I
come
in?
LOLA:
I've
had
the
most
appalling
evening.
The

have
been
torturing
me.
Look.
How
awful.
Chinese

That's
right.
They

Can
I
tell
you
something?
Yes,
please.
What's
the
worst
word

-He's
a
sex
maniac!
-What's
Cecilia
going
to
do?
-You
ought
to
call
the
police.
He
said
he
thought
about
it
all

long.
All
you
have
to
do
is
show
them
the
letter.
-You
won't
tell
anyone,
will
you,

Good.
If
he
found
out,
You're
right.
You
better
tidy
your
face.
Thanks,
Briony.
You're

BRIONY:
Cecilia!
-It
was
a
mistake.

God,
I'm
so
sorry.
Yes.

I
never

my
whole

I
saw
him.
Because

I

I
will.

It's
all
right

I

I

it

you

You

it
was
him?
Or
you
saw
him?

I
did,
I
saw

They
want
more
empire,
and
it's
"Bob's
your
uncle"
Think
about
it.
ROBBIE:
Dearest
Cecilia.
The
one
I
had
been
planning
I
can
become
again
the
man
at
dusk
in
my
best
suit,
The
man
who,
with
the
clarity
of
passion,
The
story
can
resume.
I
will
return,
find
you,
love
you,
marry
you.
And
live
without
shame.
You
can
smell
the
sea.
Fuck
me.
-It's
like
something
out
of
the
Bible.
OFFICER:
Come
on,
get
everybody
ROBBIE:
We've
just
arrived,
sir.
Can
you
OFFICER:
Nothing.
Just
wait.
A
few
made
it
in
yesterday,
Lost
3,000
men
High
command,
in
its
infinite
wisdom,
A
disgrace,
a
fucking
disaster.
No,
look,
the
thing
is,
you
see,
There's
over
300,000
men
on
this
beach,
Just
be
grateful
you're
not
wounded.
No,
no,
no,
leave
it,
guv!
Never
trust
a
sailor

That's
not
right.


Christ.
MAN:
Can
you
hear
me,
laddies?
I'm
coming
home!
MEN:

Take
from
our
souls
And
let
our
ordered
lives
confess
The
beauty
of
Thy
peace
The
beauty
of
Thy
peace
Breathe
through
the
heats
of
our
desire
Thy
coolness
and
Thy
balm
Let
sense
be
numb,
let
flesh
retire
Speak
through
the
earthquake,
wind
and
fire
O
still,
small
voice
of
calm


Guv'nor.
I
have
to
get
something
to
drink.
You
need
one.
You're
grey.
He's
gone
all
grey,
can
you
see?
There.
Come
on.
MAN:
All
I
want's
a
cup
of
tea
now.
MAN:
What
the
fuck
you
doing?
MAN:
I'm
coming
home!

Fuck
'em
all!
Fuck
'em
all!
Fuck
all
the
Sergeants
and
WO1s
and
their
bastard
sons
'Cause
we're
saying
goodbye
to
them
all
You'll
get
no
promotion
So
cheer
up,
my
lads

Mike!
Mike!
Hold
up,
guv.
Wait
here.
WOMAN:
Why
don't
you
sit
down?
It's
so
hot
in
here.
Take
off
your
boots.
I
have
to
get
back.
I
promised
her.
To
put
things
right.
And
she
loves
me.
She's
waiting
for
me.


Oi!
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Hey,
what
have
you
done
with
your
boots?
-Look,
you're
sure
you're
feeling
all
right?
Now
I'm
wondering
whether
the
beach

-I'm
not
sure,
I
don't
recognise
it.
-This'll
do,
down
here.
-No,
no,
it's
further
on.
This
place
I
know,
an
old
cottage
and
blue-painted
window
frames.
Aw,
yes.
-It's
close
to
here.
Here
we
are,
guv.
Down
here.
That's
all
right,
guv.
That's
right.
Get
your
head
down.
Get
your
head
down.

Tuck
yourself
in.
Keep
yourself
warm.
Chew
on
a
bit
of
this.
But
quiet
like,
Try
and
get
some
sleep.

ROBBIE:
Find
you.
Love
you.
Marry
you.
And
live
without
shame.
I
love
you.
Come
back.
Come
back
to
me.
-NETTLE:
Bit
too
much
noise,
guv'nor.
-What
noise?
-Some
of
the
lads
are
getting
a
bit
peeved.

-Christ.
You
look
a
bit
rough.
I'm
meeting
someone,
Now,
listen.
Listen
to
me,
guv'nor.
I
went
out
for
a
Jimmy
Riddle
just
now.
They're
getting
themselves
sorted
out
The
boats
are
back,
and
a
geezer
from
We're
away.
We're
off
home,
mate.
So
get
some
more
sleep,
and
no
more
-All
right?
Wake
me
before
7:00,
would
you?
You
won't
hear
another
word
London
Bed
castors
should
be

found
three
yesterday
that
weren't.
Which
of
you
were
responsible
-FIONA:
I
was,
Sister.
-what
you
did
wrong?
Labels
are
folded
to
the
inside,
-Yes,
Sister.
Nurse
Tallis,
I'll
see
you
in
my
office.
-ls
this
job
at
all
important
to
you,
Tallis?
Yesterday,
you
were
seconded
When
your
patient
came
round
from
his

to
ask
for
Briony.
-Well,
me,
Sister.
You
are

Yes,

Fiona,
I

So
this

I

Do

No.
I

Do
you

-Do
you
write
about

-Can
I

I
don't
see
any

in
writing

-It's
not

It's
unfinished.
-It's
complicated.
It's
just...
It's
about
a
young

a
young
and
her

which
she
doesn't
I
probably
won't
ever
finish

I
look
at
you,
Tallis,
I've
never
been

-Do
you
know
what
I
decided
tonight?
I
could
never
marry
a
man



Here
we
are.
Cecilia
Tallis.
I
think
this
is
her
address.
Thank
you.
BRIONY:
Dear
Cecilia.
Please
don't
As
you'll
have
seen
from
the
doing
my
nurses'
training.
I
decided
not
to
take
up
Oh,
God.
I
decided
I
wanted
to
make
myself
useful.
FIONA:
It
says
in
the
newspaper
BRIONY:
Yes,
I
saw
that.
It's
a
euphemism
for
retreat.
No
matter
how
hard
I
work,
I
can't
escape
from
what
I
did
and
what
it
meant,
the
full
extent
of
which
Cee,
please
write
and
tell
me
we
can
meet.
Your
sister,
Briony.
-FIONA:
So
do
you?
Have
a
secret
fianc
in
France.
No,
of
course
not.
Imagine
not
knowing
if
he'd
ever
come
back.
I've
never
been
in
love.
What,
never?
Not
even
a
crush?
Oh,
I
had
a
crush
once,
when
I
was
10
or
1
1.
I
jumped
into
a
river
to
see
-Now
you're
teasing
me.
But
as
soon
as
I
told
him
I
loved
him,
Something's
happened.

NURSE:
Outside,
quickly.


Robbie.
Excuse
me.
Nurse
Tallis,
you
speak
a
little
French,
Only
school
French,
Sister.
There's
a
soldier
in
Bed
13.
Go
and
sit
Off
you
go.


Here
you
are
at
last
Sister
sent
me
for
a
little
chat
I
remember
your
sister
she
was
always
so
nice
what's
she
doing
now?
She
is
a
nurse
as
well
Did
she
finally
marry
that
man
I've
forgotten
his
name
Robbie?
She
will
soon
I
hope
Robbie
yes
that's
right
And
you?
What
is
your
name?
Luc.
Luc
Cornet.
And
you?
Tallis.
Tallis.
That's
pretty
I
remember
you
now
the
English
girl
You
remember
your
first
visit
to
Millau?
I
was
working
by
the
ovens
with
my
father.
I
heard
your
accent
Can
you
do
me
a
little
favour
Tallis?
These
bandages
are
so
tight,
can
you
loosen
them
a
bit,
please?
Of
course
You
remember
my
younger
sister,
Anne?
She
still
plays
that
little
Debussy
piece
do
you
remember?
She
looks
so
serious
when
she
plays
And
our
croissants,
what
did
you
think
of
them?
The
most
delicious
in
Millau
Yes.
it's
the
quality
of
the
butter
Yes
Is
that
why
you
came
every
day?
Because
you
know,
my
mother
is
very
fond
of
you
in
her
opinion,
we
should
get
married
in
the
summer
Oh
yes?
Yes
I
hope
that's
more
comfortable
Do
you
love
me?
Yes
Can
you
stay
a
while?
I'm
frightened
-Tallis.
Je
m'appelle
Briony.
SISTER:
Stand
up,
Nurse
Tallis.
Now
go
and
wash
the
blood
off
your
face.

What

they
are.
Keep

Thirdly,
it

I

Therefore,
if
any

can
show
why
they
may
not

I
know
it
was
him.
...Iet
him
now
speak

I
saw
him.
I
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes.

WOMAN:
Let
the
nursey
through.
They're
going
down
to
the
country
today.
I
hope
they
get
a
nice
family.
They
don't
know
what
they're
in
for
Come
on.
I'm
looking
for
Miss
Tallis.
Cecilia
Tallis.
Is
she
in?
Tallis!
Door!
I
tried
writing.
You
wouldn't
answer.
I
have
to
talk
to
you.

-So
you're
a
ward
sister
now?
Thanks.
I
want
to
go
in
front
of
a
judge
Don't
call
me
that.
Please
don't
call
me
that.
I
know
what
I
did
was
terrible.
Oh,
don't
worry,
I
won't.
You're
an
unreliable
witness.
Well,
at
least
I
can
go
home
and
explain
-So
what's
stopping
you?
They
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
about
it.
That
unpleasantness
is
all
tidied
away
But...
I'll
be
late.
Better
get
moving.
Excuse
me.
He
sleeps
so
deeply.
-What
is
she
doing
here?
Oh,
yes,
what
about?
The
terrible
thing
I
did.
Robbie.
Darling.

I'll
be
quite
honest
with
you.
I'm
torn
between
breaking
your
neck
here
and
taking
you
Oh,
God.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
it's
like
in
jail?
Tell
me,
did
it
give
you
pleasure
-No.
-No.
-No.
Yes.
But
yes
and
no.
-And
what's
made
you
so
certain
now?
-Growing
up?
How
old
do
you
have
to
be
to
know
What
are
you,
18?
Do
you
have
to
be
18
before
There
are
soldiers
of
18,
old
enough
-did
you
know
that?
Five
years
ago,
You,
all
your
family,
you
just
assumed
I
was
still
little
better
than
a
servant.
Thanks
to
you,
they
were
able
to
close
ranks
-Robbie!
Look
at
me,
look
at
me.
Come
back.
Come
back.
Come
back
to
me.
CECILIA:
Briony.
There
isn't
much
time.
Robbie
has
to
report
for
duty
at
6:00,
So
sit
down.
There
are
some
things
You'll
go
to
your
parents
and
you'll
tell
them
everything
to
be
convinced
You'll
meet
with
a
solicitor,
have
it
signed,
witnessed,
Yes.
You'll
write
a
detailed
letter
to
me
leading
up
to
you
saying
Try
to
include
whatever
you
can
remember
of
what
Danny
Hardman
was
doing
-Hardman?
It
wasn't
Danny
Hardman.
It
was
Leon's
friend,
Marshall.
I
don't
believe
you.
He's
married
Lola.
Lola
won't
be
able
to
testify

He's
immune.
I'm
very,
very
sorry
for
the
terrible
distress
I
am
very,
very
sorry.
ROBBIE:
Just
do
as
we've
asked
of
you.
Write
it
all
down,
just
the
truth,
no
rhymes.
And
then
leave
us
be.
I
will,
I
promise.

BRIONY:
I'm
sorry.
MAN:
Of
course.
Is
something
the
matter?
I
just
need
a
couple
of
minutes
by
myself.

...minutes
by
myself.
MAN:
Briony
Tallis,
your
new
novel,
Briony?
I'm
sorry.
Could
we
stop
for
a
moment?
Briony
Tallis,
I'd
like
to
talk
now
which
comes
out
in
a
few
days
-It's
your
twenty-first
novel...
Oh,
really?
Are
you
retiring?
I'm
dying.
My
doctor
tells
me
which
is
essentially
Your
brain
closes
down,
gradually
which
for
a
writer
is
pretty
much
the
point.
So
that's
why
I
could
finally
write
the
book,
And
why,
of
course,
it's
my
last
novel.
Strangely
enough,
it
would
be
just
as
accurate
I
wrote
several
drafts
as
far
back
as
my
time
I
just
couldn't
ever
find
the
way
to
do
it.
MAN:
Because
the
novel
is
autobiographical,
Yes,
entirely.
I
haven't
changed
any
names,
And
was
that
the
problem?
No.
I
had,
for
a
very
long
time,
No
rhymes,
no
embellishments.
And
I
think...
You've
read
the
book,
I
got
first-hand
accounts
of
all
the
events
the
conditions
in
prison,
But
the
effect
of
all
this
honesty
You
see,
I
couldn't
any
longer
imagine
By
what?
Sorry.
Served
by
honesty?
By
honesty.
Or
reality.
Because,
in
fact,
I
was
too
much
of
a
coward
I
never
made
that
journey
to
Balham.
ROBBIE:
Do
you
have
any
idea
BRIONY:
So
the
scene
in
which
CECILIA:
He
sleeps
so
deeply.
BRIONY:
Invented.
ROBBIE:
How
old
do
you
have
to
be
to
know
BRIONY:
And,
in
fact,
Because
Robbie
Turner
died
of
septicaemia
on
June
the
first,
1940,
the
last
day
of
the
evacuation.
Cheerio,
pal.
And
I
was
never
able
to
put
things
right
because
she
was
killed
by
the
bomb
that
destroyed
the
gas

So...
My
sister
and
Robbie
were
never
able
they
both
so
longed
for,
and
deserved.
And
which,
ever
since,
I've...
Ever
since
I've
always
felt
I
prevented.
But
what
sense
of
hope,
or
satisfaction,
could
a
reader
derive
So,
in
the
book,
I
wanted
to
give
Robbie
I'd
like
to
think
but
a
final
act
of
kindness.
I
gave
them
their
happiness.
