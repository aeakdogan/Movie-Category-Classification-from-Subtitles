a
portrait
of
my
father.
He
was
very
special
to
me.

people
should
know
that.
Would
you
comment
on
Listen,
Russel.
Let's
grow
up,
huh?
but
there's
an
upside
l
just
wanna
remind
you
all
this
stuff
lt's
great
PR
though,
isn't
it,
Hub?
So
what's
the
upside?
Simple,
and
it
could
happen.
Somoza
destroys
the
insurgents,
shitcans
the
purveyors
of
excess,
and
is
finally
beloved
as
-
You
got
a
smoke?
-
What's
the
downside?
Señor
Kittle.
Excuse
me,
Russel,
This
is
a
democracy,
and
l
have
-
There
were
more
votes
than
voters...
No
me
ven
que
estoy
ocupado
l
am
sorry.
l
have
to
conclude
l
have
many
more
questions,
Did
he
tell
you
about
his
parents
-
Yes,
l
know
about
that,
but
l'd
like
to...

-
l'll
just
make
sure
everything's
set
up.
My
friends,
this
gathering
was
not
as
much
as
a
get-together.
But
l've
just
been
handed
Rafael
is
dead.
He
has
been
killed
in
an
ambush
-
Mr
President!
Sorry,
my
friends.
No
questions,
please.
A
press
release
is
being
prepared.
Call
Washington.
What
do
you
think?
Tacho
makes
that
speech
about
-
Hub,
is
this
for
real?
Russel,
excuse
me,
but
Miss
Panama
-
ln
colour?
Señor
presidente.
Listo,
listo.
That'll
be
fine
right
there.
How
in
the
hell
could
Tacho
find
Rafael?
Russel,
please.
l
have
my
hands
full.
That's
fine
right
there.
ls
Tacho
lying
again?
What
do
l
know?
Tacho
needs
a
victory
very
badly.
He
needs
to
prove
to
Jimmy
Carter
The
death
of
Rafael
is
the
proof
he
needs.
Carter
doesn't
need
proof.
He
just
sent
No,
no.
He
didn't.
The
State
Department
is
getting
nervous
En
el
sol,
por
favor.
Pardon
my
French,
-
l
work
for
everybody.
l
send
messages
to
Jimmy
and
l
tell
him
which
cannot
be
stopped,
Nobody
listens
to
me.
l
can't
even
get
a
little
water
in
my
pool.

Would
you
switch
sides,
please?
That's
very
nice,
very
nice.
Thank
you.
l
think
Rafael
is
alive.
l'm
gonna
find
him.
Thank
you
very
much.

How

you...
Alex,

bodies?
You
stupid
son

hundred
Rafaels,
Don't

How

to
me?
This

a
motherfuckin'
story.
What

with
it?
Have
you
found
Rafael
yet?
You
know,
there's
a
rather
strange
one
Thought
you
might
have
the
answer.
You
see,
there's
a
rumour
that
Price's
pictures
are
phoney.
That's
bullshit.
Rafael's
