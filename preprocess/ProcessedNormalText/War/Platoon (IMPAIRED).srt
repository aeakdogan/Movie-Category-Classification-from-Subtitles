CHRIS:
Somebody
once
wrote,
"Hell
is
the
impossibility
of
reason."
That's
what
this
place
feels
like.
Hell.
I
hate
it
already,
and
it's
only
been
a
week.
The
hardest
thing
I
think
I've
ever
done
I
don't
even
know
what
I'm
doing.
A
gook
could
be
standing
three
feet
I'm
so
tired.
We
get
up
at
5:00
a.m.,
hump
all
day,
camp
around
4:00
or
5:00,
Then
put
out
an
all-night
ambush
It's
scary,
'cause
nobody
tells
me
Nobody
cares
about
the
new
guys.
The
unwritten
rule
is
'cause
he
hasn't
put
his
time
in
yet.
And
they
say
if
you're
gonna
get
killed
it's
better
to
get
it
in
the
first
few
weeks.
The
logic
being
you
don't
suffer
that
much.
If
you're
lucky,
and
then
you
pull
a
three-hour
guard
shift.
So,
maybe
you
sleep
three,
four
hours
but
you
don't
really
sleep.
I
don't
think
I
can
keep
this
up
for
a
year,
I
think
I
made
a
big
mistake
coming
here.
We've
got
beaucoup
movement.

The
third
battalion
just
got
hit
Charlie
had
claymores
Blew
a
whole
fucking
platoon
to
pieces.

Yeah,
they
got
two
lieutenants
Jesus.
All
right,
Sergeant,
Elias,
you
take
your

out.
Warren,
you
stay
in,
but
I
need
Tex
and
Junior
from
your

Roger
that.
Okay,
move
out
in
two-zero
mikes.
I
thought
it
was
O'Neill's
turn
tonight.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Fu
Sheng's

You

Send

Hey,

How

Turn

It
was
the
end
of
the
mystery.
The
motherfuckers.
CHRIS:
The
village,
didn't
know
we
were
coming
that
day.
If
they
had,
they
would
have
run.
Barnes
was
at
the
eye
of
our
rage.
And
through
him,
our
Captain
Ahab.
He
would
set
things
right
again.
That
day,
we
loved
him.


There
he
goes,
Sarge.

Fucking

He's
laughing
at
you.
That's
the
way
the
gook
laughs.
Yeah,
sure
you
are.
You're
real
sorry,
ain't
you?
You're
just
crying
your
little
hearts
out
Forget
about
it,
Bunny,
huh?
Let's
go.
What
do
you
say?
Holy
shit!
You
see
that
fucking
head
I
never
seen
brains
like
that
before,
man.
I
bet
you
the
old
bitch
She
probably
cut
Manny's
throat.
She'd
probably
cut
my
balls
off
Bunny,
we
leave
now.
-You
understand
me,
Taylor?
Not
a
fucking
thing.
Come
on,
man,
let's

Look
at
the
scars
on
this
gook
honcho,
Get
out
of
here,
Tubbs.

Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

Where'd
he
get
these
wounds?


-Says
he
was
hit
in
a
bombing
raid.
Ask
him
why
those
weapons
are
here.


Says
they
had
no
choice.
Says
the
NVA
killed
the
old
honcho
Now
he
says
all
the
rice
is
theirs.
Oh,
bullshit,
Lerner.
Who
the
hell
was
the
gook


He
doesn't
know.
He
says
that
the
NVA
Look,
maybe
he
was
a
scout
or
something,
Yeah,

a
scout.
What
about
the

That
cocksucker
knows
what
I'm
saying!
-Goddamn

he
does.
Damn

He's
lying

teeth.
Waste

talks.
The
boy
doesn't

He
swears

He

Right

I

every
man
in
the
field,
Staff
Sergeant
Barnes,
-Yes,
sir.
Now,
we're
going
back
into
This

from
the
East.
You
people
get
some
rest
and
be
back
up

at
the
CP
-Yes,

Come

You

chucks
It
could
just
as
well
have
been
you,
Harold,
And
that
Bunny,
I
mean,
he
scares
me,
man.
Look,
you
bloods
are
getting
too
hung
up
These
gooks
are
a
lot
smarter
You

Barnes
knows
his
shit,
man.
They
was
NVA,
every
last
one
of
them.
Now,
he's
taken
us
this

I
don't

This

It

seem
the
way
you
shoot
up
that
shit
I
don't
know,
brothers,
but
I'm
hurting
real
bad
inside.
Don't
worry
about
it,
Sergeant.
-l
mean,
he's
a
troublemaker,
but...
like
them
politicians
in
Washington
with
one
hand
tied
around
their
balls.
Ain't

need
or
time
MAN:
Come

-Sarge.
How'd
it
go
there,
Bob?

Yeah.
Atta
way,
Sarge.
Fucking
Elias,
man.
He's
a
fucking
rat,
that's
what
he
is.
He's
gonna
get
everybody
in
this
platoon
Somebody
ought
to
frag
his
ass.
So,
what
do
you
think
there,
Bob?
Bob?
BUNNY:
O'Neill,

you

Sarge

take
care
of
it.

CHRIS:
It's
a
beautiful
night.
ELIAS:
Yeah.
I
love
this
place
at
night,
the
stars.
There's
no
right
or
wrong
in
them.
They're
just
there.
That's
a
nice
way
of
putting
it.
Barnes
has
got
it
in
for
you,
doesn't
he?
Barnes
believes
in
what
he's
doing.
And
you?
Do
you
believe?
In
'65,
yeah.
Now,
no.
What
happened
today
We're

maintain
It's
all
a
blur.
I
have
no
energy
to
write.
I
don't
know
what's
right
The
morale
of
the
men
is
low.
A
civil
war
in
the
platoon.
Half
the
men
with
Elias,
half
with
Barnes.
There's
a
lot
of
suspicion
and
hate.
I
can't
believe
we're
fighting
each
other
Counting
days
and
the

Not

else.
Hope

are
well,

Elias
and
all
the
good
times
Shit.
You're
trying
to
cure
the
headache
Elias
didn't
ask
you
to
fight
his
battles
If
there's
a
heaven,
l
know
he's
sitting
up
there
and
smoking
shit,
'cause
he
done
left
his
pains
down
here.
You're
wrong,
man.
Any
way
you
cut
it,
KING:
Right
on.
Taylor,
I
remember
telling
me
how
much
you
admired
I
was
wrong.
Wrong?
And
dig
this,
you
assholes,
Barnes
been
shot
seven
times
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you,
huh?
Barnes
ain't
meant
to
die.
The
only
thing
that
can
kill
Barnes
BARNES:
Talking
about
killing?
Y'all
experts?
Y'all
know
about
killing?
I'd
like
to
hear
about
it,
potheads.
Why
do
you
smoke
this
shit?
Me,
I
don't
need
this
shit.
I
am
reality.
There's
the
way
it
ought
to
be.
And
there's
the
way
it
is.
Elias
was
full
of
shit.
Elias
was
a
crusader.
Now,
I
got
no
fight
with
any
man
who
does
what
he's
told,
but
when
he
don't,
And
when
the
machine
breaks
down,
And
I
ain't
gonna
allow
that
in
any
of
you.
Not
one.

Y'all
love
Elias.
Oh,
you
wanna
kick
ass.
Yeah.
Well,
here
I
am,
all
by
my
lonesome,
and
ain't
nobody
gonna
know.
Six
of
you
boys
against
me.
Kill
me.

l
shit
on
all
of
you.
You
motherfucker!
KING:
Give
it
to
him!
Whoop
his
ass.
Yes,
man.
-Come
on,
man!
Go.
-Oh,
fuck,
come
on.
Come
on,
boy!
Come
on!
Easy,
Barnes.
Don't
do
it,
man.
You'll
go
dinky
down
in
LBJ,
man.
Ten
years
for
killing
an
enlisted
man.
Ten
years,
Don't
do
it.

Death?
What
do
you
all
know
about
death?
CHRIS:
They
sent
us
back
into
the
valley
about
2,000
meters
from
Cambodia
into
a
battalion
perimeter.
It
felt
like
we
were
returning
Alpha
Company
had
been
hit
hard
and
Charlie
Company
had
been
probed
There
were
other
battalions
in
the
valley.
But
we
knew
we
were
gonna
be
the
bait
Somewhere
out
there
Caught
those
motherfuckers
on
Charlie
Company
last
night.
They
found
maps
on
them,
man.
Got
a
friend
at
battalion,
says
they
had
every
fucking
foxhole
here
Distances,
tree-lines,
our
claymores,
This
is
bad,
man.
I
got
bad
vibes
here.
I
also
heard
we're
in
fucking
Cambodia
Cambodia?
Man,
you
kidding
me.
You
wanted
to
see
me,
sir?
Yeah,
Ramucci.
Squad,
sir?
I
didn't
know
we
were
still
referring
All
right,
look.
I
want
you
to
take
those
two
holes
You're
tying
it
off
with
Barnes
up
here,
Yeah.
Begging
your
pardon,
sir.
My
two
holes
are
far
enough
apart
and
never
see
them.
I
have
five
live
bodies
left,
sir.
Look,
I
don't
wanna
hear
your
problems,
You'll
get
new
men
any
day.
Meantime,
you
make
do
-I
didn't
ask
for
this
job.
-Oh,
you
don't
wanna
hear
it?
I
don't
wanna
hear
it,
'cause
to
tell
-l
just
don't
give
a
flying
fuck
anymore.

I'm
glad
I
ain't
going
with
them.
Somewhere
out
there
is
the
beast
What
a
fucking
bummer.
Ten
days
and
a
wake-up,
What's
the
matter
with
you,
man?
How
come
you
ain't
writing
nobody?
What
about
your
folks?
That
grandma
you
was
telling
me
about?
Girl?
You
got
a
mother
and
father,
don't
you?
Nah,
there's
nobody.
You
been
smoking
too
much
of
this
shit,
Gotta
control
that.
Bring
a
man
down.
I
remember
when
you
first
come
out
here,
You
was
green
as
a...
Did
you
ever
get
caught
in
a
mistake
There's
a
way
out
of
anything,
man.
Just
keep
your
pecker
hard
and
the
world
will
turn.

How
many
days
you
short?
Nah,
it's
not
just
me.
It's
the
way
the
whole
thing
works.
People
like
Barnes
just
go
on
So
what
do
we
do?
We
just
don't
add
up
to
dry
shit,
King.
Whoever
said
we
did,
man?
All
you
got
to
do
is
make
it
out
of
here,
and
it's
all
gravy.
Every
day,
the
rest
of
your
life,
gravy.
Oh,
shit,
superlifer.
Hey,
King,
collect
up
your
shit.
Now
look,
man.
Don't
fuck
with
me.
What
do
you
need,
a
written
invitation,
Cocksucker!
Oh,
wow!
The
lifers
have
made
a
mistake.
They
cut
me
some
slack,
Taylor.
Look,
you
get
your
freight
to
Rodriguez.
You
got
1
0
minutes
to
make
'cause
if
you're
not
on
it,
I'm
gonna
be.
Taylor,
Francis
is
coming
up.
That's
great,
King.
I'm
happy
for
you,
man.
-You
take
it
on
home
for
me,
okay?
You
got
my
address.
You
know
where
you
can
get
a
hold
of
me
I
gotta
beat
it,
man.
-You
okay?
Remember
now,
take
it
easy.
Don't
think
Remember,
ain't
no
such
thing
My
man.
I'll
walk
you
out,
man.
Take
it
easy,
King.
I'm
gonna
take
it
any
way
I
can
get
it,
I
hear
you.
Later.
I'm
pretty
fucked
up,
Sarge!
Oh,
man!
Don't
touch
that.
I
got
to
get
on
a
chopper,
man.
So
what's
the
problem?
Says
he
can't
walk.
Shit.
Martin,
get
your
boots
on.
And
the
next
time
I
catch
you
spraying
I'm
gonna
court-martial
your
nigger
ass.
Well,
then
court-martial
me,
Bust
my
ass.
You
do
your
fucking
worst!
You
white
folks
have
got
-O'Neill,
get
me
that
centipede.
Yeah,
that
long,
hairy,
l
found
in
the
ammo
crate.
I'm
gonna
put
it
in
this
boy's
crotch,
I
remember
now.
Hey.
Now
hold
up,
man!
You
just
hold
up
and
wait,
all
right?
Fuck
it!
I'll
walk!
I'll
fucking
walk,
man!
Fucking
pussy,
man.
Yeah.
Bob,
I'd
like
to
speak
to
you
a
minute.

l
can't
take
it
no
more.
-I'd
like
to
speak
to
you,
Bob.
Bob,
I
got
Elias'
R&R.
I
was
thinking
about
going
to
Hawaii,
Hey,
Bob,
come
on,
I
never
asked
you
You
know,
I
was
thinking
maybe...
l
was
hoping
you'd
put
me
What
do
you
say,
chief-a-rooney?
I
can't
do
that
for
you,
Red.
We
need
every
swinging
dick
in
the
field,
Hey,
Bob,
come
on.
All
I'm
asking
for
is
three
fucking
days,
I
am
talking
to
you,
Red,
So
get
back
in
your
foxhole.
Bob,
I
got
a
bad
feeling
on
this
one,
I
mean,
I
got
a
bad
feeling.
I
don't
think
I'm
gonna
make
it
out
of
here.
You
understand
what
I'm
saying
to
you?
Everybody
got
to
die
sometime,
Red.
Oh,
shit.
Goodbye,
motherfuckers!


Where's
that
fucking
ambush?
They
ain't
even
waiting
till
later.
Right
fucking

You
know,
Junior,
I
don't
feel
like
we
done
something
wrong.
But
sometimes,
man,
l
get
this
bad
feeling.
I
told
the
Padre
the
truth,
man.
You
get
to
do
what
you
want.
The
only
worry
you
got
is
dying.
And
if
that
happens,
So
what
the
fuck,
man.
Shit,
I
got
to
be
in
this
hole
I
just
know
I
shouldn't
have
come.
Don't
you
worry,

-How
you
doing?
Well,
that's
good.
Yes,
sir.
-You
ready?

CHRIS:
I
think
now,
looking
back,
we
did
not
fight
the
enemy.
And
the
enemy
was
in
us.
The
war
is
over
for
me
now,
but
it
will
always
be
there
as
I'm
sure
Elias
will
be,
fighting
with
Barnes
for
what
Rhah
called
There
are
times
since,
I've
felt
like
the
child
But,
be
that
as
it
may,
those
of
us
who
did
make
it
have
an
obligation
to
build
again,
to
teach
to
others
what
we
know,
and
to
try
with
what's
left
of
our
lives
to
find
a
goodness
and
meaning
