In
the
last
century
before
the
birth
which
was
destined
to
overthrow
the
Roman
Republic
stood
at
the
very
'Of
all
things
fairest,
''
'first
among
cities
and
home
Yet,
even
at
the
zenith
the
Republic
lay
fatally
stricken
The
age
of
the
dictator
waiting
in
the
shadows
In
that
same
century:::
in
the
conquered
an
illiterate
slave
woman
by
giving
birth
to
a
son
A
proud,
rebellious
son:::
who
was
sold
to
living
death
before
his
thirteenth
birthday:
There,
under
whip
and
chain
and
sun:::
he
lived
out
his
youth
dreaming
the
death
of
slavery

Back
to
work!
Back
to
work!
Get
up,
Spartacus,
you
Thracian
dog!
Come
on,
get
up!
My
ankle,
my
ankle!
My
ankle!
Guard,
guard.
Spartacus
again?
Back
to
work,
all
of
you.
-
Welcome,
Lentulus
Batiatus.
Oh,
eleven
miles
and
the
cost
of
hiring
Even
so,
I
warrant
you
have
I've
wasted
my
time
and
my
money.
-
Tell
me
the
truth.
These?
Carrion!
The
buzzards
are
late:
This
one's
not
bad.
I
don't
like
Gauls.
Can
he
come
down
unassisted?

Come
down!
-
Be
good
enough
Thank
you.
Yes...
as
the
teeth
go,
This
mouth
is
-
The
fellow's
made
of
chalk.
The
sun's
over
there.
-
Who's
that?
-
I'm
making
an
example
of
him.
Starve
him
to
death.
What
a
pity.
He
reacts.
Can
I
see
his
teeth?
Open
your
mouth,
Spartacus!
You
smell
like
a
rhinoceros.
Captain,
you
asked
him
-
He
doesn't
obey
you?
-
He
hamstrung
a
guard
with
them
I
wish
I'd
been
here:
Let's
look
at
some
of
the
others:
Come
along!
In
spite
of
sickness
and
death...
we
will
profit
1
1
,000
sesterces!
Including
your
commission,
Oh,
no,
sir.
Marcellus,
there
they
are.
They're
a
dirty-looking
lot,
No
one
else
could
have
made


Slaves...
you
have
arrived
at
the
gladiatorial
You'll
be
trained
by
experts
You
won't
fight
That
will
be
after
you've
been
sold...
and
then
for
ladies
for
those
who
appreciate
A
gladiator's
like
a
stallion:
He
must
be
pampered.
You'll
be
oiled,
bathed...
shaved,
massaged,
A
good
body
with
a
dull
brain:::
is
as
cheap
as
life
itself!
You'll
be
given
Marcellus,
please.
Be
proud
of
them.
On
special
occasions,
will
even
be
given
Approximately
half
our
graduates...
live
for
five,
ten,
ten
years.
Some
even
attain
freedom:::
and
become
trainers
themselves.
I
congratulate
you.
And
may
fortune
smile

Marcellus,
watch
the
second
He's
a
Thracian.
They
were
going
-
We'll
break
him
of
that.
Aaah!
Next.
Aaah!
Next.

I
like
you.
I
want
you
to
be
my
friend.
I
want
to
be
your
friend.
All
I
ask
What's
your
name,
slave?
Spartacus.
I
feel
you
don't
like
me.
Give
him
your
sword.
Take
it!
I
have
a
feeling
This
is
the
only
chance
Kill
me!
Don't
be
afraid,
slave.
You
have
that
sword.
I
only
have
this
piece
of
wood!
Are
you
going
to
disobey
me?

Take
his
sword:
You're
not
as
stupid
You
might
even
be
intelligent.
That's
dangerous
for
slaves:
from
now
on
everything
you
do
You
did
the
right
thing.
Marcellus
likes
to
kill
I
think
he's
picked
you.
-
How
long
have
you
been
here?
I
wish
he'd
pick
me.
I
want
one
chance
at
that
pig
Quiet!
Dionysius,
you'll
just
like
in
the
mines.
What's
your
name?
You
don't
want
to
know
my
name.
I
don't
want
to
know
your
name!
Just
a
friendly
question.
Gladiators
don't
make
friends.
If
we're
ever
matched
I'll
have
to
kill
you.
Helena...
with
Galino.
Patricia...
Crixus.
Priscilla...
David.
Claudia...
Pharox.
Varinia...
-
Dionysius.
Spartacus.
Felicia:::
I've
never
had
a
woman.

You
have
one
now,
-
Go
away.
Indeed,
what
will
I
think
of
you?
-
Go
away.
We
must
learn
I'm
not
an
animal!
You're
not
trying
to
escape,
Direct
your
courage
I'm
not
an
animal!
-
I'm
not
an
animal:
What's
your
name?
Varinia.
You'll
have
to
take
her
You
may
not
be
an
animal:::
but
this
sorry
show
that
you'll
ever
be
a
man.

Here...
here.
Always
remember,
If
you
don't,
In
the
blue,
Here...
here...
here...
and
here.
Second
rule...
go
for
the
cripple
Here's
a
slow
kill
Here...
here...
and
here.
Remember...
a
slow
kill
may
have
enough
left
With
a
cripple,
if
you
keep
your
distance
The
rest
is
all
right
but
here
at
Capua
we
expect
and
we
get
it.
Spartacus,
why
are
you
Varinia!
Stand
still:
Since
all
he
can
do
all
right,
slave,
I
said,
look!
No.
No,
this
one
Have
a
good
night's
rest,



Woman!
I've
warned
you
All
right,
bring
them
in.
No
talking!

No.
That's
a
kill.
One...
two...
three...
four...
five.
One...
two...
three...
four.
We
have
visitors,
Two
simply
enormous
Roman
lords
How
easily
impressed
Just
'cause
they're
Romans,
Tell
them
to
wait
for
me
-
Master,
you
don't
understand!
One
of
them
is
What?
Crassus
here?
Chairs
in
the
atrium.
No,
the
best,
Gracchus!
You
know
-
Take
him
away.
Use
your
imagination!
Tell
Marcellus
Crassus
has
expensive
taste.
Forgive
me,
Gracchus.
Marcus
Licinius
Crassus...
Most
Noble
Radiance...
first
general
of
the
Republic...
father
and
defender
of
Rome,
Bless
it
with
your
presence.
Wine!
Sweetmeats!
Can't
you
see
that
Have
the
goodness
to
sit.
Is
anything
wrong,
Your
Nobility?
No.
Welcome
to
the
Lady
Claudia
Maria...
former
wife
whose
recent
execution
Honour
to
the
Lady
Helena...
daughter
of
the
late
whose
fame
shall
live
on
forever...
in
the
person
of
his
son,
Marcus
Publius
Glabrus...
hero
of
the
Eastern
Wars.
How
very
much
he
knows.
Allow
me
to
bring
you
up-to-date.
We're
here
to
celebrate
the
marriage
A
mating
of
eagles!
Fan
His
Magnitude.
My
young
friends
desire
Two
pairs.
-
I
have
something
To
the
death,
Your
Ladyship?
Surely
you
don't
think
for
gymnastics?
But
I
beg
Your
Honours.
We
train
the
finest
We
can
give
you
a
display
When
they're
sold,
their
new
masters
But
here,
no,
we
never
fight
Crassus.
Today
is
an
exception.
But
the
ill
feeling
it
would
spread
Then
the
cost.
Name
your
price.
25,000
sesterces.
Arrange
it.
Are
you
serious,
sir?
Arrange
it
immediately.
Of
course,
we
shall
want
-
You
do
have
a
certain...
variety?
Spartacus,
there's
going
to
be
-
To
the
death?
I
heard
Marcellus
-
Who
fights?
To
the
death.
What
if
they
matched
you
and
me?
They
won't.
What
if
they
did?
Would
you
fight?
I'd
have
to.
So
would
you.
Would
you
try
to
kill
me?
Yes,
I'd
kill.
I'd
try
to
stay--
I'd
try
to
stay
alive

Some
visitors
want
to
admire
you:
Form
a
line
in
front
of
me.
Would
Your
Excellencies
care
Claudia.
Oh,
they're
magnificent.
For
you,
Lady
Helena...
may
I
suggest...
Praxus?
A
veritable
tiger:
I
don't
like
him.
-
I
prefer
that
one.
-
No,
no.
Oh,
Crixus,
yes:
Crixus
for
the
short
sword.
Ah!
Have
you
ever
seen
such
a
pair
I
admit
he's
small,
and
extremely
strong.
He
looks
smaller
here
Optical.
-
Give
me
that
one.
Yes,
yes:
Galino:
Your
Pulchritude,
Galino.
Practically
every
man
is
an
expert
but
the
trident
is
something
May
I
suggest...
the
Ethiopian.
There
are
very
few
Ethiopians
Ethiopians
are
recognized
I'll
take
him.
Draba?
Oh,
no:
-
I
do
think
the
Ethiopian--
I'll
take
the
big
black
one.
Draba.
Only
one
man
stands
a
chance
with
the
Thracian
knife
There.
-
Over
there,
Lady
Helena.
I'll
take
him:

Have
him
flogged!
Over
there,
Lady
Helena.
I
prefer
the
coward.
Spartacus.
If
both
men
are
down
your
trainer
will
slit
their
throats:
Tricks,
madam?
You
heard
the
instruction,
I
feel
sorry
for
the
Don't
put
them
Let
them
wear
just
enough
Whatever
they
wear,
Lady,

Our
choosing
has
bored
you?
No,
most
exciting.
Do
let's
get
out
of
the
sun.
May
I
conduct
Your
Magnificences

-
Oh,
the
gods!
How
far
from
Rome
must
I
go
Don't
talk
about
Gracchus.
For
Gracchus,
hatred
of
the
patrician
and
not
such
a
bad
one,
either.
How
else
can
one
become
master
Crassus,
it's
so
boring.
I
believe
that
girl
smells
Whatever
it
is,
You
can't
keep
slaves
from
stealing
When
a
slave's
as
pretty
as
she
is,
An
arrangement
is
made:
If
her
ankles
are
good...
you
can
be
sure
-
Oh,
master!
I've
been
anointed!
Why,
you
trollop!
It
was
an
accident.
Don't
be
frightened.
-
What
country
are
you
from?
How
long
have
you
been
a
slave?
Since
I
was
thirteen.
You
have
a
certain...
education.
My
first
master
had
me
tutored
I
like
her.
I'll
buy
her.
Buy
her,
Your
Magnificence?
I
have
spent
quite
I've
no
doubt
of
it.
She'll
be
waiting
at
your
litter:
No,
I
don't
want
her
feet
Send
her
to
Rome
with
your
steward
He
leaves
tomorrow,
More
wine,
and
thank
your
gods!
You
provoke
me,
Crassus.
-
I
shan't
be
nice
to
you
any
more!
You're
horribly
rich...
yet
you're
the
only
one
who
hasn't
given
him
Ah!
I
was
saving
it
Here.
What
is
it?
As
from
this
moment,
your
husband
Wonderful!

Ahh!
I
don't
know
how
I
shall
Time
will
solve
that
mystery.
-
The
garrison
of
Rome.
The
only
power
in
Rome
strong
enough
You
are
clever!
Open
up.
Through
that
door.

You
will
have
Father
almost
disinherited
him

The
marriage
contract

Every
one
of
them
is
under
twenty:::
and
taller
than
they
should
be:

She
sets


shall
go
the
honour

First
pair!

Those
who
are



Aaah!

Crixus.
Next
pair!
Those
who
are
about
to
die
salute
you.


How
were
you
able
to
get
my
appointment
I
fought
fire
with
oil.
I
still
think


Kill
him:

-
Kill
him!
-
Kill
him,
you
imbecile!
Kill
him!
He'll
hang
there
till
he
rots.

She's
going
to
Rome.
She's
been
sold?
No
talking
Aaah!



There's
trouble
in
the
mess
hall.
-
They
killed
Marcellus
-

On
second
thoughts,
Ride
to
Capua.
Call
out
the
garrison.
-
I
hold
you
responsible.
Ho!


Aaah!
Around
Capua,
forcing
other
slaves
to
join
them.
Looting,
robbing,
while
they
make
their
camp
Each
day
swells
their
numbers.
The
situation
lies
in
the
hands...
of
this
august
body.
Where's
the
mighty
Crassus?
-
Out
of
the
city.
No
need
to
fear
for
Rome
Let
me
add...
over
1
00
among
them,
gentlemen,
my
own...
burned
to
the
ground
I
propose
the
immediate
recall
I
could
raise
500
men
Don't
make
a
fool
of
yourself.
Why...
call
back
the
legions...
when
the
garrison
of
Rome
-
but
to
defend
us
from
sausage
makers?
Let's
send
Glabrus

I
protest.
There
are
more
slaves
With
the
garrison
absent,
I
did
not
say
the
whole
garrison.
Six
cohorts
will
The
rest
can
stay
in
Rome

Will
you
accept
I
accept
the
charge
of
the
senate...
if
the
senate
truly
charges
me.
The
garrison
of
Rome
stands
ready.
Slave
hunting's
a
dirty
business.
It
takes
a
brave
commander
I
propose
we
turn
in
tribute
to
Glabrus
And:::
for
temporary
command
I
propose
Caius
Julius
Caesar:

You
don't
look
very
happy
It's
not
a
serious
disturbance.
Maybe.
At
least
it
gives
me
a
chance...
to
separate
Glabrus
You
know,
this
republic
of
ours...
is
something
like
a
rich
widow.
Most
Romans
love
her
But
Crassus
dreams
of
marrying
Hail
Glabrus!
Hail
Glabrus!
-
God
be
with
you,
Glabrus.
I
hope
he
returns
Oh,
one
fat
one,
Fimbria!
Keep
the
change.
-
May
the
gods
adore
you.
Let's
make
an
old-fashioned
sacrifice
I
thought
you
Privately
I
believe
in
none.
Publicly
I
believe
in
them
all.
Greetings,
Is
Marcus
Glabrus
in
attendance?
-
He
awaits
you
in
the
atrium,
sir.
-
What
have
we
here?
Antoninus...
Sicilian,
age
26...
singer
of
songs.
For
whom
did
you
practise
For
the
children
of
my
master...
whom
I
also
taught
the
classics.
Classics,
indeed.
What
position
have
we,
I
wonder...
for
a
boy
of
such
varied
gifts?
You
shall
be
my
body
servant.
All
of
you,
come
with
me.
Are
you
on
guard
duty?
My
dear
Crassus,
Or
better
still,
I
congratulate
us.
Tomorrow
I
lead
six
cohorts
against
the
slaves
on
Vesuvius.
The
whole
city
is
Great
merciful
bloodstained
gods!
Your
pardon.
I
always
address
heaven
Did
Gracchus
have
something
Yes,
he
proposed
it.
And
you?
Do
you
think
to
control
some
It
was
to
control
I
only
take
six
cohorts.
Under
whose
command?
-
Under
Caesar's.
Finding
Gracchus
in
control
you
felt
compelled
to
hand
over
I
see.
I'll
refuse,
One
of
the
disadvantages
is
that
occasionally
You've
pledged
to
go,
If
Gracchus
should
decide
He
won't!
He
has,
with
your
assistance,
Your
legions
are
in
camp
My
legions?
Do
you
truly
believe
I'd
order
You
can...
if
you
have
to.
Are
you
not
aware
that
no
general
may
enter
the
city
-
Sulla
did.
To
the
utter
damnation
No,
my
young
friend.
One
day
I
shall
cleanse
this
Rome
I
shall
restore
all
the
traditions
It
follows
that
I
cannot
come
by
an
act
which
betrays
I
shall
not
bring
my
legions
I
shall
not
violate
Rome...
at
the
moment
of
possessing
her.
Go.
Prepare
your
troops
at
once.
March
out
of
Rome
tonight,
We've
already
been
made
Let's
not
add
Leave
by
unfrequented
streets...
without
fanfare,
Sneak
out.
As
you
wish.
And
for
heaven's
sake,
see
to
it
that
you
don't
Farewell.



A-ha-ha!
Come
on,
fat
boy!

Hey,
Spartacus!
Noble
Romans.
Fighting
each
other
like
animals!
Your
new
masters,

Drop
your
swords.
-
No!
No!
I
want
to
see
their
blood
When
I
fight
matched
pairs,
I
made
myself
a
promise,
Crixus.
I
swore
that
I'd
die
before
I'd
watch
Draba
made
that
promise
too.
He
kept
it.
So
will
I.
Go
on.
Get
out!
What
are
we,
Crixus?
What
are
we
becoming?
Have
we
learned
nothing?
We
look
for
wine
-
When
you've
got
wine,
You
can't
just
be
a
gang
-
What
else
can
we
be?
An
army
of
gladiators.
There's
never
been
One
gladiator's
worth
We
beat
the
Roman
guards,
but
a
Roman
We
can
beat
anything
-
It
takes
a
big
army:
Once
we're
on
the
march,
we'll
free
Can
anybody
get
a
bigger
army?
Once
we
cross
the
Alps,
Nobody
can
cross
the
Alps.
Every
pass
There's
only
one
way
The
sea.
What
good
is
the
sea
The
Cilician
pirates
have
ships.
They're
at
war
with
Rome.
Every
Roman
galley
that
sails
They've
got
the
biggest
I
was
a
galley
slave.
Give
them
-
We
haven't
got
enough
gold.
-
We'll
have
gold
all
right.
Let's
hire
these
pirates

Come
join

Come
on

Come
on!
Hey!
Back
to
Vesuvius!
Come
on!
Varinia.
I
thought
Everything's
so
different.
The
last
time
I
saw
you,
you--
you
were
waiting
in
the
arena
to--
I--
I
thought
How'd
you
escape?
I--
I
jumped
out
of
the
cart...
and
Batiatus
was
so
fat--
I
flew
out
of
the
cart...
and
Batiatus
was
so
fat...
he
couldn't
catch
me.
He
couldn't
catch
up
with
me.
Do
you
realize...
nobody
can
ever
sell
you
again?
Nobody
can
sell
you.
-
Or
give
you
away.
-
Nobody
can
ever
make
you
Oh,
I
love
you,
Spartacus.
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
I
still
can't
believe
it.
Forbid
me...
ever
to
leave
you.
I
do
forbid
you.
I
forbid
you.
I
forbid
you.

How
good
you
are
to
me,
-
You
may.
Don't
just
eye
those
birds.
There's
no
need
to
be
May
I
remind
you...
you've
been
good
to
me
-
I've
been
good
to
you?
Oh,
ho,
ho.
You've
sold

Ladies.
Ladies!
Since

Perhaps
I
used
the
wrong
word.
I
hope
I
pronounced
that
word.
It's
well-known
that
even
your

I'm
the
most

in
Rome.
I
keep

Great
Gracchus,
but
there's
one
man

Who's
that?
-
You've
grown
very
ambitious
There
I
was,

a

All
because

I
sold

-
Whom?
There
was
no

soon
as
the

was
made.
Now
she's
off
with
Spartacus
And
Crassus,
You
never
offered
me
Well...
she's
not
-
She
is
very
thin
and--
-
You'll
see

500
sesterces
Since
he
hasn't
paid:::
this
gives
me
first
call
May
the
gods
adore
you!
Why
would
you
want
a
woman
To
annoy
Crassus,
of
course,
Fetch
a
stool,
Antoninus.
In
here
with
it.
That
will
do.
Do
you
steal,
Antoninus?
No,
master.
Do
you
lie?
Not
if
I
can
avoid
it.
Have
you...
No,
master.
Do
you
refrain
out
of
respect
Yes,
master.
Do
you
eat
oysters?
When
I
have
them,
master.
Do
you
eat
snails?
No,
master.
Do
you
consider
the
eating
and
the
eating
of
snails
No,
master.
Of
course
not.
It
is
all
a
matter
Yes,
master.
And
taste
is
not
and
therefore
not
a
question
Hmm?
It
could
be
argued
so,
master.
That
will
do.
My
taste
includes...
both
snails
and
oysters.
Antoninus,
look.
Across
the
river.
There
is
something
There,
boy,
is
Rome.
The
might,
the
majesty...
the
terror
of
Rome.
There
is
the
power:::
that
bestrides
the
known
world
No
man
can
withstand
Rome.
No
nation
can
withstand
her.
How
much
less...
a
boy!
Hmm?

There's
only
one
way
to
deal
You
must
serve
her.
You
must
abase
yourself
You
must
grovel
at
her
feet.
You
must...
love
her.
Isn't
that
so,
Antoninus?
Antoninus!
Antoninus?
Take
your
time!
-
How
are
they
coming?
-
and
we
can
march
on
Rome.
Here
on
Vesuvius,
while
we
organize
It
may
take
six
months,
Once
we're
strong,
we're
gonna
fight
We're
going
to
arrange

The

will
be
our
road
home.

you
agree,
you
may
join
us.
If
you
don't
agree,
go

My

I

You'll
teach
us

Anyone

What's

Antoninus.
There's

I'm

You

I

Nothing!

-
How
many
are
there?
-
Where?
against
the
cliffs:
-
Strong
camp?
No
stockade?
Are
you
sure?
-
I'm
very
sure.
The
Romans
are
having
a
picnic.
-
Did
they
see
you?
Maybe
we
ought
to
join
Form
your
men.
Six
cohorts.
A
lot
of
arms
and
weapons...
to
build

army
with.

should!

That's

Haven't

enough
to

how
easy
it
is
to
die?
Of
course
you
have.
Why--
What
are
you
going

I
don't

What
should
we

Let's
have
a

I'll

gladiator!

You
keep
staring
at

Do
you
recognize
this
baton?
-
Yes!
It
was
in

tent.
The
symbol
of
the
senate.
All
the
power
of
Rome!
That's
the
power
of
Rome!
Take
that
