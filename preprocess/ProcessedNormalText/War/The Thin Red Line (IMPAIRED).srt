touch
the

be
What
the
hell
are
they
doing?
They're
just
lying
there
behind
that
ledge!
They
should
be
up
and
out,
I
don't
think
you
understand
We've
had,
uh,
heavy
casualties.
We
had
a
man,
uh
-
uh
-
His
gut
got
shot
out
on
the
slopes,
sir.
Fine,
fine.
I
have,
uh,
two
squads
to,
uh
-
First
platoon
I
can
send
up,
sir.
Over.
What
the
hell
do
you
mean,
Goddamn
you,
Staros!
When
I
say
You
commit
everybody
you
have
there
Your
first
platoon
too.
I
see
'em
lying
down
there
You
get
a
man
to
'em
right
now
And
you
move
'em
Then
you
get
that
second
platoon
-
Have
'em
press
the
center.
You
attack
them
right
now!
Jesus
Christ,
Staros!
Do
I
have
to
give
you
while
your
men
are
Colonel,
I
don't
think
that
you
fully
My
company
alone
The
Japs
are
too
well
dug
in.
Colonel,
there's
a
-
We
can't
see
it,
and
it's
-

I
formally
request
to
be
given
permission
to
the
right
of
Hill
210
I
believe
the
entire
position,
sir,
can
be
-
No!
Goddamn
it,
I
tell
you
no!
-
Now
listen
to
me,
Staros.
You're
not
gonna
take
your
men
to
avoid
a
goddamn
fight!
Now
do
you
hear
me,
Staros?
I
want
you
to
attack
right
now
Now
attack,
Staros!

Sir,
I
must
tell
you

-

This
is
not
your
fault,
Jim.
I
again
request
permission
for
patrol
reconnaissance
The
time,
sir...
is
1321
hours,
25
seconds.
I've
got
two
witnesses
here
I
request
that
you
do
the
same
Staros,
don't
you
pull
this
Now,
I
know
you're
a
goddamn
lawyer!
This
is
not
a
court
of
law!
Now,
I
want
that
frontal
attack!
I
repeat
my
order!
Over!
Colonel,
I
refuse
to
take
my
men
It's
suicide,
sir.
for
two-and-a-half
years,
and
I
will
not
Over.
This
is
a
very
important
decision

But
if
you
feel
that
strongly,
-
So
I'm
coming
down
there.
Now,
I'm
not
rescinding
But
if
I
find
there
are
extenuating
I'm
gonna
take
that
into
account.
Now,
in
the
meantime,
goddamn
it,
And
if
possible,
you
get
those
men

One
spot's
as
good
as
another,
men.
Um,
um-
just
take
it
easy,
son.
Take
it
easy.
Where's
-
Where's
Fife?
Fife?
He's
right
here,
son.
Fife.

Hold
my
hand.


Oh.
I'm
dying,
Fife.
Oh,
Captain.

Can't
lift
the
lid.
Played
a
role
I
never
conceived.
Get
that
blouse
on,
soldier!
Yeah,
right
here.
Put
it
on
right
now.
Let's
go
get
those
son
of
a
bitches!
Move
up!
What
are
you
doing
laying
down
there
Observing,
sir.
Just
sent
1st
platoon
-
How
many
of
'
em
were
hit
this
time?
None?
Not
one?
That
doesn't
sound
much
like
the
situation
Well,
it's
not,
sir.
The
situation's
changed,
sir,
Captain,
you
listen
to
me.
Now,
we're
going
over
there,
Now,
do
you
have
any
more
-
No,
sir.
Not
now.
We're
gonna
do
things
my
way!
My
way!
We're
taking
everybody
over
to
that
ledge!
I
think
the
ridge
is
quite
a
way
Show
me
how
to
see
things
Show
me
how
to
see
things
We're
just
dirt.
We're
just
dirt.
We're
gonna
get
killed
if
we
stay
here.
Bell,
take
six
men...
and
go
see
what's
up
there.
And
we'll
cover
you

Okay.
You
guys
-
You
guys
stay
here.
Okay?
I'm
goin'
up
alone.

Come
out
where
I
am.

There
was
a
-
a
-
It's
five
guns.
It's
five
guns.
That
strongpoint
up
there
-
somewhere
up
there
around
those
rocks
-
is
the
key
to
this
ridge.
Bell
here
is
quite
right.
From
their
knob
up
there,
can
cover
the
whole
of
the
ground
in
front
They've
left
this
ledge
unguarded.
That's
a
hell
of
a
mistake.
We
need
to
take
advantage
of
it
All
right.
All
right,
And
we've
had
a
hell
of
a
time
For
that
I'm
sorry.
But
if
we
can
reduce
this
bunker
tomorrow,
So
I'm
asking
for
volunteers.
Go
back
up
there
and
knock
it
out.

I'll
be
glad
to
-
to
go
back
up
-
All
right,
Bell.
And
you.
All
right.
I'd
like
to
lead
the
party,
Colonel.
All
right,
John.
-
Go
ahead.
You'll
be
in
command.
-
All
right,
you.
You.
All
right,
men.
That's
enough.
I
don't
know
if
you
realize
Once
our
position
is
secured,
That
means
air
power
Guadalcanal
may
be
It'll
cost
lives,
Staros.
-
Is
that
what's
troubling
you?
Now,
I
explained
to
you
How
many
men
do
you
think
it's
worth?
I
can't
say,
sir.
Are
you
prepared
to
sacrifice
the
lives
How
many?
One?
Two?
Twenty?
Lives
will
be
lost
in
And
if
you
don't
have
the
stomach
for
it,
No,
sir.
You're
right.
About
everything
you
said.
Fine.
Fine.
One
more
thing,
Staros.
It's
not
necessary
for
you
to
ever
tell
me
Ever.
We'll
assume
it.
Dismissed.

I
feel
sorry
for
you,
kid.
-
Yeah?
This
army's
gonna
kill
you.
If
you
were
smart,
There's
nothing
you
can
do
Just
running
into
a
burning
house

What
difference
you
think
you
can
make?

If
you
die,
it's
gonna
be
for
nothin'.
There's
not
some
other
world
out
there
There's
just
this
one.
Just
this
rock.

Who's
deciding
who's
gonna
live?
Who's
deciding
who's
gonna
die?
This
is
futile!
Look
at
me.
Not
one
shot!
Why?
How
come
they
all
had
to
die?
I
can
stand
right
here.
I
can
stand
right
up,

We
together.
One
being.
Flow
together
like
water...
till
I
can't
tell
you
from
me.

Now.
Now.

My
guide.

If
you
can
break
through,
We'll
charge
at
your
whistle
signal.
All
right,
let's
go,
men.




Okay.
Stay
down,
below
this
ledge...
and
I'll
call
down
the
data

the

have
plastered

and

up

down!


Fall

Move

Look

Come

Get
out

Come

Put

up
your
nose.




Fire
in
the
hole!

Look
at
'em
move!
We
got
'em
on
the
run!
When
they
saw
you
make
that
attack
and
win,
it
was
like
you'd
put
-
Hey!
Hey!
Take
good
care
of
the
others,
men.
There'll
be
somebody
around
I
think
we've
wasted
enough
time
here.
Sir,
I've
got
a
few
recommendations
Yes,
yes,
John.
We're
gonna
get
everything
In
the
meantime,
I
want
you
to
know
that
I'm
personally
Perhaps
the
big
one.
Thank
you,
sir,
Oh,
yes,
you
do,
John.
Getting
it
for
you,
now,
But,
hell,
it
would
just
be
a

too

up
with

you
like
to

Of

Sir,
I
don't
mean
to
be
a
wet
blanket
or
-
If
we
don't
get
some
water
to
these
-
John,
I
don't
want
anything
to
now
that
we
have
the
momentum.
We'll
have
some
water
I've
arranged
for
that.
Now,
we
just
can't
stop
now,
No,
sir.
That's
right.
And
if
some
of
the
men...
pass
out...
why,
hell,
they'll
just
have
to
pass
out.
All
right.
They
could,
uh
-
Well,
they
could
die
They're
all
tough
boys.
Come
on,
men,
let's
go!
You'll
see
plenty
more
of
those
Are
we
going
up
this
hill
John,
I'm
convinced
that
the
Japanese
All
we
have
to
do
is
keep
going
We'll
have
this
hill
by
sundown.
You
see
the
spirit
in
these
men?
Well,
I
want
to
take
advantage
of
that
before
something
happens
To
have
this
battalion
relieved
or
even
to
have
it
reinforced
from
troops
If
we
were
to
stall
Jesus
Christ,
that's
just
I've
waited
all
my
life
for
this.
I've
worked,
slaved,
eaten,
Oh,
untold
and
I
don't
intend
to
give
it
up
now.
You
don't
know
what
it
feels
like
I
mean,
you're
young.
Y-Y-Y-You're
just
out
of
the
academy.
Fifteen
years,
this
-

You're
like
a
son
to
me,
John.
You
know
what
my
son
does?
He's
a
bait
salesman.
You've
done
a
hell
of
a
job,
John.
I'm
gonna
make
sure
that
everything
that
you
deserve.
Thank
you,
sir.
God
-
Goddamn
it!
I
want
three
runners!
You
go
back
to
the
rear
and
get
back
here
with
it

We'll
throw
everything
We're
going
all
the
way!
It's
high
ground
by
nightfall!


They're
no
different
than
dead
dogs...
once
you
get
used
to
the
idea.
They're
meat,
kid.

Kind?
Does
your
confidence
lie
in
this?
Are
you
loved
by
all?
Know
that
I
was
too.
Do
you
imagine
your
sufferings
Truth?








This
Way!


Get
down!


Get
down!
Get
down!
Get
down!
Stay
there!

Get
back!
Now!





Where
does
it
come
from?
How
did
it
steal
into
the
world?
What
seed,
Who's
doing
this?
Who's
killing
us...
robbing
us
of
life
and
light...
mocking
us
with
the
sight

Does
our
ruin
benefit
the
earth?
Does
it
help

passed
I'm
gonna
sink
my

leave

here?
Yep.

I
slowed
'em
up.
Don't
mind,

can
come
with

if
you
want.
I'll
help
you
along.
Nah,
it's
nice
and
quiet...
peaceful
up
here.
I'd

slow
you
up.
I'll
remind

you

you
You
care
about
me,
I
always
felt
like
you
did.
Why
do
you
always
One
day
I
can
come
up
By
the
next
day...
it's
like
we
never
even
met.
Lonely
house
now.
You
ever
get
lonely?
Only
around
people.
Only
around
people.
You
still
believing
How
do
you
do
that?
You're
a
magician
to
me.
I
still
see
a
spark
in
you.

and
thinks
there's
nothing
But
death's
got
the
final
word.
It's
laughing
at
him.
Another
man
sees
that
same
bird...
feels
the
glory...
feels
something
smiling
through
it.



You
explain
to
-
to
headquarters
-
No.
'Cause
we're
sitting
ducks
out
here.
Well,
I
think
that's
up
to
me
No,
I
think
we
just
need
to
send
somebody
Okay?
It's
easy.
Hey,
Weld,
uh,
The
fire's
coming
closer,
sir.
Line's
cut.
This
line?
Well,
we
need
to
send
somebody
out
there
and
we
need
to
find
out
how
Come
on.
Uh,
okay,
okay.
Uh...
hey,
you.
You
go.
You're
going,
Fife.
Coombs.
-
Come
on.
But
I
want
you
to
know
I
think
If
they
come
down
here
they're
gonna
knock
our
position
Well,
you
don't
have
to
go,
Private.
No,
I
want
to
go,
sir.
In
case
All
right.
That
jungle's
too
thick.
I
will.
Good
luck,
Witt.
You
okay,
Fife?

We
need
to
go
back,
Let's
go.



-


Get
back!
One
of
us
needs
to
stay
here

We'll
be
all
right.

My
friend
here
doesn't
have
long.
So,
you
go.
You
go
on
ahead.



Witt.

-
Shh.
Shh.

They're
coming.
I
gotta
go.
I
don't
want
you
to
be
afraid.
Just
hide
out
here
till
you
hear
firing.
Then
push
on
down
the
river.


-
Where's
Coombs?

Fall
back.
Where's
Witt?

Fife,
where's
Witt?

Fife.
Fife,
where's
Witt?







America.





Now,
I
know
you
men
have
been
making
That's
okay
by
me.

Any
man
in
an
outfit
of
mine
can

As
long
as
he's
ready
and
and
carry
out
any
assignment
he
is
given.
If
he
can't
do
that,

Now,
I
prefer
to
think
of
myself
and
that's
what
we
all
are
here,
We
are
a
family.
I'm
the
father.
Guess
that
makes

And
whether
you
guys
like
it
or
not,
that
makes
you
all
Now,
a
family
can
have
only
one
head,
Father's
the
head,
mother
runs
it.
If
any
of
you
men
want
to
see
me
-

You're
in
a
box.

You
will
find
that
I
am
available.
This
war
is
not
gonna
be
over
It's
gonna
be
a
long
time

or
in
their
lie.
Only
one
thing
a
man
can
do
-
find
something
that's
his...
make
an
island
for
himself.
If
I
never
meet
you
in
this
life...
let
me
feel
the
lack.
A
glance
from
your
eyes...
and
my
life
will
be
yours.

Somethin'
I
can
come
back
to.
I
mean,
I
don't
know
what,
you
know
-
I'm
determined
now.
I've
been
through
You
know,
I
may
be
young,
I'm
ready
to
start
living
it
good.
You
know,
my
daddy
always
told
me
it's
gonna
get
a
whole
lot
worse
You
know,
'cause
life
ain't
supposed
Well,
I
-
I
figure
after
this,
It's
time
for
things
to
get
better.
That's
what's
gonna
happen.
I'm
getting
older
now.
By
no
means
old,
but
older.

Who
were
you
that
I
lived
with...
walked
with?
The
brother.
The
friend.

Strife
and
love.
Are
they
the
workings
of
one
mind...
the
features
of
the
same
face?

let
me
be
in
you
now.
Look
out
through
my
eyes.
Look
out
at
the
things
you
made.
All
things
shining.
