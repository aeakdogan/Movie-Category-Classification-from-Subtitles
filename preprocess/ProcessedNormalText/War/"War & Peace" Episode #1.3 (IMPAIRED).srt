I
think
we
will
lose
this
battle,
My
God,
Bolkonsky,
what
a
shambles!

How
do
you
really
feel
about
Sonya?
I
do
love
her,
Tasha.

I
haven't
been
a
very
but
it's
no
use
saying
that
now.

Here
he
is!
Your
wife
is
even
more
beautiful
To
the
health
of
beautiful
women,
and
their
lovers.
I
challenge
you!
Count
Bezukhov?
If
I
might...
Look
here,
you
don't
want
to
be
Apologise,
No-one
will
think
any
No.
No,
we're
here
now.
Just
show
-
Captain
Dolokhov?
If
you
could
just
remind
me
You
point
it,
and...?
Oh,
Lord.
Hold
out
your
arm
straight
in
front
And
squeeze
the
trigger,
Turn
sideways
on
-
show
him
Don't
give
him
an
easy
target.
Thank
you,
I'd
forgotten.
-
There's
still
time
to
call
it
off.
No,
I
know
it's
stupid,
but

Good
luck,
then.
As
the
adversaries
have
refused
At
the
count
of
three,
you
may
You
may
not
go
further
than
After
the
count
of
three,
One.
Two.
Three.

-
Fedya!
Dolokhov!
No!
Get
back
behind
the
barrier,
It's
not
over
yet.
Turn!
Cover
yourself!

Missed!
Stupid,
stupid,
stupid!
Death,
lies!
How
bad
is
it?
If
she
sees
me
dying,
Who?
My
mother.
My
angel.
She
and
my
poor
sister,
in
my
life,
Rostov.

The
only
ones
I
care
for.
I
have
to
live,
for
them.
Yes,
I
understand.
Move,
man!
Anatol,
stop
it.
Ah.
Pierre.
Well...
I'll
just...
What
have
you
done
now?
What
have
I
done?
You've
made
an
and
of
me.
Someone
told
you
that
Dolokhov
Now
you've
made
us
Are
you
asking
me
to
believe
Of
course
I
am
innocent!
Though
no-one
would
blame
me
It's
not
much
fun
being
married
to
Most
people
think
you're
-
Don't
speak
to
me
like
that!
I
am
the
injured
party
here,
How
am
I
to
go
into
society
I
never
interfered
It's
better
that
we
part.
What
did
you
say?
I
said
it's
better
that
we
part!
All
right.
If
that's
what
you
really
want.
You'll
only
expose
yourself
You
know
you'll
have
to
give
me
I'll
kill
you!

Out!
Get
out!


A
thousand
apologies,
there
will
be
a
little
wait
It's
nice
and
warm
in
the
parlour,
if
you
don't
mind
sharing
it
No,
no
-
I
don't
suppose
Good
evening.
Evening.

What?
I
believe
I
have
the
pleasure
I
have
heard
about
the
misfortune
and
I
am
very
sorry
for
it.
I
should
like
to
help
you,
if
I
can.
But
if
for
any
reason
you
find
conversation
with
me
No.
No,
I'm
glad
Then
let
me
offer
you
You're
a
Mason?
Yes,
I
belong
to
the
brotherhood
I'm
afraid
my
way
of
thinking
I
don't
believe
in
God.
Of
course
you
don't.
You
don't
believe
in
God
And
that's
why
you're
so
unhappy.
I
am
unhappy.
I
should
think
anyone
could
see
that,
How
can
I
know
God,
if
all
my
powers
of
reasoning
God
is
not
apprehended
by
reason,
but
by
life.
I
don't
understand
you,
sir.
Well...
..you
are
young,
you
are
rich,
What
have
you
done
with
all
these
good
things
Very
little,
so
far.
You
need
to
purify
yourself,
Look
at
yourself.
Ask
yourself,
are
you
content
with
yourself?
With
your
life?
No,
I
hate
my
life.
I
hate
myself.
Good.
You
have
taken
the
first
step.


Your
wound
still
troubles
you?
Yes,
a
little.
-
You
still
keep
up
a
good
pace,
Father.
I
never
vary!
Work,
exercise,
a
good
night's
What
next
for
you?
No.
I've
had
enough
for
now
And
Napoleon's
wars
seem
like

I'd
like
to
make
myself
useful
here.
Plenty
here
to
keep
you
occupied.
Build
yourself
a
house
A
man
needs
his
own
place.
What
do
you
say
to
that?
-
I
think
it's
an
excellent
idea.

I've
drawn
up
a
list
of
economies
I
strongly
recommend
Yes,
yes,
but
one
doesn't
care
One
has
to
entertain
-
The
position
is
really
quite
serious.
austerity
shall
be
our
watchword
Thank
you
for
your
-
I'll
be
good,
I
promise.

Well,
what
is
it,
my
dear
boy,
I'm
sorry
to
have
to
ask,
Father,
I've
been
helping
Dolokhov
-
Ah,
yes,
how
is
the
poor
fellow?
But
he
and
his
mother
and
sister,
-
barely
afford
to
heat
their
rooms.
You're
a
generous-hearted
boy.
Now,
I
can't
spare
you
very
much
Bakshin
was
very
strict
with
me
Will
2,000
roubles
That
will
be
ample,
Father
-
See
if
you
can
make
it
last
I
give
you
my
word
that
it
will.
And,
Father,
I
should
like
to
to
come
and
stay
here
for
My
dear
boy,
any
friend
Thank
you.

To
the
health
and
happiness
of
all,
and
the
splendid
recovery
I
can't
thank
you
enough,
and
you,
Countess,
Nonsense
-
it's
our
pleasure.
You're
one
of
the
heroes
Nothing
to
be
proud
of,
sir
-
It's
all
I
know,
to
my
shame.
Don't
disparage
yourself,
Fedya
-
Then
I'd
better
say
nothing
How
is
your
mazurka
coming
along,
Well,
we
thought
we
were
until
Denisov
told
us

-
You
did.
Oh,
I
was
dancing
when
you
were
still
in
Really?
The
way
they
used
to
teach
us
Have
you
always
lived
with
Yes,
since
I
was
a
little
girl.
Nikolai
speaks
so
warmly
of
you,
and
now
I
can
see
why.
I
should
like
to
know
you
better,
DENISOV:
..It
was
the
footman!
Dolokhov
watches
you
all
the
time.
Doesn't
it
make
you
Yes.
But
there's
no
harm
in
it.
He
can
look
all
he
likes.
You're
so
sure
of
yourself.
Mama
says
that
girls
That
they
have
their
day
in
the
sun,
It's
more
than
a
day.
But
how
long?
A
year
or
two?
To
choose
or
be
chosen.
And
then,
and
then,
that's
our
lives
settled...
It's
frightening.
You
just
have
to
choose
right,
But
how
will
I
know?
You
will.
But
will
I?
I'm
sorry,
Nikki,
Why
on
Earth
not?
-
There's
something
cruel
about
him.
-
No,
I'm
not!
If
you
could
see
him
at
home
Well,
I
don't
know
about
that.
And
I'm
sure
Pierre
was
in
the
right
Oh,
Pierre!
He's
an
idiot.
No,
he's
not.
Whereas,
that
one...
..can't
you
see
He's
just
being
nice
to
her.
No,
he
doesn't.
And
I'm
not
sure


You
sure
you're
up
to
this,
Fedya?
Come
again.
Whoa!
You'll
have
to
show
me
Trade
secret,
my
boy.

Your
cousin
is
a
lovely
girl,
And
your
sister,
of
course.
I
thought
you
were
the
man
-
except
his
own
mother
and
sister.
Innocence
and
purity
You've
known
these
girls
you
take
their
qualities
I
suppose
you're
right.
You
see
and
feel
very
deeply,
Some
things.
Some
things.
A-ha!
-
A
mazurka!
I
knew
we
had
one
somewhere!
We've
heard
you
boasting,
-
No,
no,
no.
Make
him,
Father!
No
excuse,
Denisov,
-
Yes,
best
idea
all
night.




Denisov,
you're
a
wonderful
For
you
-
all
for
you.
Oh,
thank
you.
Now
this,
you
absolutely
deserve!
-
Yes!
Shall
we
sit
down?


Countess.
Natasha.
If
I
don't
speak
now,
I
adore
you.
I
have
never
felt
this
way
I
think
about
you
all
day
-
Oh,
dear.
but
I
must
ask
you.
Will
you
make
me
and
consent
to
be
my
wife?
Oh...
er...
I
wish
you
hadn't
said
that.
I
beg
your
pardon.
-
I
couldn't
help
it.
I'm
so
fond
of
you...
I
can't
say
it.
Please.
Forget
about
it.
A
moment
of
madness.
All
over
now.
Now,
if
you
will
excuse
me...


Now
you
must
be
blindfolded.
Why
is
that?
If
you
wish
to
join
our
brotherhood,
you
must
be
willing
to
submit
Are
you
willing?
Yes.
Yes.
I
will
leave
you
now.
When
you
hear
knocking,
you
may
remove
the
blindfold.


Why
have
you
come
here?
For
wisdom?
For
virtue?
For
enlightenment?
For
renewal.
I
want
renewal.
MEN:
Sic
transit
gloria
mundi!
Always
aid
your

Raise
up
the
fallen.
Forgive
your
enemy.
Take
no
revenge
upon
him,
Go
out
into
the
world
now.
Live
not
for
yourself,
You
must
be
so
happy
that
he
has
Well,
I
won't
say
a
word
against
but
truly
it
has
been
a
bit
I'm
very
glad
to
be
back
And
the
Emperor
himself
has
taken
Yes,
he's
been
kind.
Vraiment?
All
the
old
crowd
here,
I
see.
Bilibin!
Enchanting
as
ever,
Comtesse.
Well,
I
should
hope
so.
But
tell
me,
Ah.
Boris
Drubestkoy.
A
very
promising
young
man.
Since
Austerlitz,
he's
been
Our
oldest
allies.
They've
only
betrayed
us
four
times
but
now
they're
supposed
to
be
Stop
talking
politics
to
me,
Just
introduce
me
and
make
yourself
scarce,
hmm?
Drubetskoy?
Over
here.
Countess
Bezukhova,
one
of
our
most
promising
Enchante.
And
you're
with
the
Prussian
How
exciting,
to
be
so
close
Do
tell
me
about
it.
Are
you
interested
in
politics,
I
adore
politics.
It's
all
so
fascinating!
Ah,
Dolokhov,
you'll
never
guess
Dolokhov?
What's
the
matter?
Did
he
tell
you?
No,
he
told
me
nothing.
There's
been
a
bit
of
a
scene.
He's
proposed
to
Sonya
She
told
him
she
was
in
love
You,
of
course,
-
He
actually
proposed
to
her?
Sometimes
I
don't
think
Mamma's
not
pleased.
She
told
Sonya
that
Dolokhov's
for
a
girl
with
no
prospects.
-
Aren't
you?
But
I
should
talk
to
her
about
it.
Yes,
I'll
get
her
to
come
down.
So,
he
really
proposed
to
you?
Yes.
I
didn't
want
him
to.
You
know,
as
Mamma
said,
He's
such
a
good
fellow
I'd
hate
for
you
to
feel
as
though
Well,
I've
already
refused
him.
And
nothing
could
make
me
He's
been
very
kind
to
me,
-
and
I
told
him
so.
-
No,
don't
say
that
to
me!
No,
but
I
must
tell
you
I
love
you,
I
think,
more
than
anyone
Well,
that's
enough
for
me.
Yes,
but
I've
fallen
in
love
before
I
can't
help
it,
it's
the
way
I
am.
And
then
when
Mamma
you
see,
I'm
not
in
a
position
-
I
don't
ask
you
to,
I
never
have.
Dolokhov's
proposal.
I'd
rather
not
marry
at
all
I
love
you
and
I
always
will.
But
I
don't
ask
anything
of
you.
I
don't
deserve
you.
You're
an
angel.

Good
day,
good
day,
I've
come
These
cottages
They
need
new
roofs,
Yes,
indeed,
your
Excellency.
And
here
would
be
a
good
place
A
school,
your
Excellency?
Yes,
indeed.
Every
boy
to
learn
to
read
and
write.
But
where
will
the
teacher
Oh,
there
are
teachers
build
the
school
Now!
Grain
stores.
Hello.
Grain
stores.


Oh,
it's
you.
I'm
so
sorry,
but
did
I
mistake
the
day?
No,
I
don't
think
so.
It's
just...
where
is
everybody?
Don't
you
think
Well,
yes,
of
course.
What
did
you
think
Well...
Are
you
hungry?
Um...
not
particularly.
Come
on,
then.
All
right,
gentlemen,
who's
in?
Ah,
Rostov!
The
very
man!
Thank
you
for
inviting
me,
Dolokhov.
I've
been
busy.
But
you're
still
my...
I
mean,
Why
wouldn't
it
be?
Or
are
you
afraid

That's
all
right,
I
trust
you.
Play
or
not,
But
I
tell
you,
ALL:
Ooh!
Well,
you
don't
know
that.
You
know
what
they
say
about
me?
Dolokhov
makes
his
own
luck.
I'll
play.
Good
man!
Stake
your
bets,
gentlemen.
Five
roubles
on
the
five.
Three
of
hearts
the
soda.
Ten
wins.
And
five
loses.
All
right,
Rostov,
Stake
your
bets,
gentlemen.
Ten
on
the
ace.
Any
more?
All
right.
Seven...
King...
..and
ace
loses.
Bad
luck,
Rostov.
Maybe
it's
not
your
night.
20
on
the
seven.

That's
how
it
goes
sometimes.
Perhaps
you'd
like
to
quit,
Rostov?
40
on
the
King.
Place
your
bets.
-
1,000
on
the
ace.
Jack
of
diamonds.
Three
of
spades.
Ace
of
diamonds.
So,
how
much
do
I
owe
you
now?







You
have
a
lovely
voice,
Nikki
-
I
have
to
go
and
speak
to
Father.

Home
at
last!
Not
especially.
Father,
I'm
afraid
I'm
going
to
Already?
I
had
a
feeling
but
I
didn't
think
Well,
you're
only
young
once.
Well,
it's
rather
a
lot.
Um,
I
lost
a
bit
at
cards,
That
is,
a
good
deal,
-
How
much?
What?
To
whom?
43,000?!
Are
you
joking?
And
I
promised
to
pay
tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
I
suppose
it
happens
Yes.
Yes,
I
suppose
It's
a
little
difficult.
We
shall
have
to
close
up
the
Well...
Well,
it
can't
be
helped.
Can't
be
helped.
Oh,
Papa!
Please
forgive
me
-
Forgive
me,
There,
there.
There,
there.
Well,
here
we
are.
We
didn't
exactly
enhance
I
certainly
didn't.
When
the
leave's
too
long,
At
least
we
know
what
We
can
do
that.
By
the
order
and
by
the
grace
of
God,
it
is
announced
that
a
peace
treaty
has
been
ratified
who
will
now
be
our
gallant
ally.

The
Emperor
Napoleon
has
been
as
a
mark
Thank
you.
Oh,
excellent.
What
was
that
all
about?
The
usual
thing.
Our
enemies
are
our
friends
now.
-
So
we're
friends
with
the
French?
It's
a
mad
world.






Is
Prince
Andrei
at
home?
Yes,
your
Excellency.
No,
no,
let
me
surprise
him.
Pierre!
How
unexpected!
I'm
delighted
to
see
you!
I've
been
making
trying
to
make
and
my
tenant
farmers,
make
my
farms
Really,
I've
no
idea
what
I'm
doing.
How
are
you?
I've
been
wondering
what
you've
been
up
to!
Not
very
much,
is
the
short
answer.
Come,
let's
have
something
Yes,
this
is
the
life
-
and
wine,
in
moderation.
To
hell
with
high
society!
You
know,
you're
exactly
the
same.
Do
you
think
so?
In
myself,
I
believe
I've
changed
I
heard
about
your
marriage.
And
how
it
ended?
You
heard
about
the
duel?
Yes,
you
had
The
one
thing
I
thank
God
for
Why
so?
If
a
dog
is
vicious,
But
to
take
a
man's
life,
Why
must
it
always
be
wrong?
For
me,
there
are
only
two
evils
-
sickness
and
remorse.
Since
Lise
died,
I
treated
her
unkindly
Disappeared
into
nowhere.
No
way
for
me
to
make
amends.
I've
been
staring
So
now,
my
sole
aim
To
do
as
little
harm
as
possible
and
to
have
as
little
to
do
No,
I
can't
agree.
I
used
to
live
for
myself
Now,
I
try
to
think
of
others,
and
I'm
much
happier
for
it.
Anyway,
you
don't
live
What
about
your
sister,
They
are
a
part
of
myself.
All
right,
I
concede,
but
I
do
my
best.
I
look
after
my
estate,
I
serve

You

Yes,
if

it
were
so.
Pierre,
I'd
like
you
to

my
son.
And

He's

BOY
WHISPERS:
He
makes
a
funny
face!

How
do
you
find
Andrei?
He
worries
me
so
much.
Today,
he's
merry
and
lively,
but
that's
just
your
effect
on
him.
He
is
unhappy.
But
it's
not
as
though
I
know.
He
does
everything
well.
But
it's

I

I'm

are.

endless

coming
to

Well,
I
shan't
be
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
my
dear
fellow,
Of
course,
you
must
stay
the
night.
And
as
long
as
you
wish!
And
you
needn't
be
talking
I've
seen
you
looking
Natasha!
Stop
that,
my
darling,
My
daughter,
Natalia.
Natasha,
this
is
one
of
the
great
heroes
I'm
happy
to
make
I
think
I
saw
you
before,
didn't
I?
Yes.
Yes,
you
looked
at
me
so
severely!
No,
not
at
all.
Not
severely.
At
least,
I
hope
not.
Go
and
take
him
away
and
talk
to
him,

Are
you
the
Prince
Andrei
He
is
my
greatest
friend.
He
loves
you
very
dearly.
Have
you
seen
him
lately?
He's
had
so
much
trouble,
I
think,
I
saw
him
just
before
I
came
here.
I
believe
he's
put
his
sorrows
he's
full
of
great
plans
Yes.
Yes,
that's
just
like
him.
I
so
want
him
to
be
happy.
Like
you.
You
seem
to
have
Don't
we
all
have
it?
Somewhere
within
us?
NATASHA:
Come
on,
please?
SONYA:
Yes,
all
right,
but
then

That's
it
-
I'm
going
to
sleep
now.
Oh,
Sonya,
how
can
you
sleep?
I
feel
as
if
I'm
going
to
Look
at
that
lovely
moon.
I
don't
think
it's
the
moon
What,
then?
Do
you
like
him
very
much?
More
than
Boris?
Yes,
much
more.
There's
something
and
that
frightens
me
a
little.
But
he's
going
away,
I
don't
suppose
Oh,
Sonya,
I
wish
Shall
I
try?
Don't
be
a
fool!
-
Come
to
bed
now.

I
understand
you
have
made
That's
very
commendable.
How
do
you
feel
about
yourself?
Well,
I
can
look
at
But...
still
not
happy.
Not
at
all.
I
sleep
badly,
What's
the
matter
with
me?
Perhaps
you
are
changing
your
world,
and
forgetting
to
change
yourself.
Do
you
try
to
forgive
"My
dear
Helene,
I
believe
we
should
"if
that
is
agreeable
to
you."
"I
ask
you
to
forgive
me
"and
for
any
damage
"that
my
conduct
may
have
caused."
Thank
you,
dear
Pierre.
"I
am
a
better
person
now,
I
hope,
I
can't
believe
you're
back
No
need
to
sound
so
shocked.
We're
not
sharing
a
bed,
So,
nothing
needs
to
change.
Come
back
to
bed.
No,
I've
got
too
much
on
Did
you
know
the
Rostovs
I
had
heard,
yes.
Aren't
you
supposed
to
be
engaged
That
was
just
a
childish
thing.
Does
she
know
that?
I
should
make
it
clear
you
can't
afford
to
be
engaged
You're
not
jealous,
by
any
chance,
Me?
Jealous?
Of
the
little
Rostov
girl?
You're
very
sweet.
You
can
see
yourself
out.
Wait!
I'll
see
you
at
the
Tsar's
ball?
Well,
you
shall
see
me,
much
less
touch
me.
I
shall
be
otherwise
engaged,
a
pretty
little
heiress
-
Think
you
can
do
that?
I
want
you.
Sweet
boy.

I'm
so
nervous!
I've
been
awake
for
hours,
thinking
Oh,
but
you've
got
nothing
to
be
It
is
important,
my
darling,
the
first
time
you'll
be
seen
Everyone's
eyes
will
be
on
you.
So,
keep
a
clear
head,
and
don't
fall
for
the
first
boy
-
Do
you
think
he
might
be
there?

Prince
Andrei
Bolkonsky.
If
God
wills
it,
he'll
be
there,
and
you'll
dance
with
him.
Now,
close
your
eyes.



Look
at
those
two.
Ah!
Charmantes!
There's
so
many
French
here.
-
As
if
nothing
ever
changed.
Napoleon
won't
be
able
to
resist
-
for
much
longer.
Well,
it's
his
nature.
He's
like
he
can't
help
it.
Ah!
The
Queen
of
Petersburg!
His
Imperial
Majesty,
The
Tsar.
-
Old
friend!
How
are
you?
I'm
very
well.
Yes
-
I
see
something's
changed
I
keep
hearing
reports
you're
reforming
the
army.
The
old
spark's
burning
bright
You
could
put
it
like
that.
And
what
about
you?
Oh,
you
don't
want
to
hear
about
me.
May
I
have
this
dance?
-
May
I
take
your
hand
for
this
dance?
Countess
Rostova.
May
I
request
the
pleasure
of
Of
course!
She'll
be
delighted.


It's
him!


I
had
no
idea,
Pierre.
I've
never
Like
what,
exactly?
I'm
in
love,
my
friend!
Yes.
Yes,
with
Natasha
Rostova,
yes?
Yes,
who
else?
I
feel
like
I've
I
feel
I
can't
live
without
her,
But
could
she
love
me?
I
am
too
old!
What
do
you
think?
Why
don't
you
speak?
The
girl
is
a
treasure,
Andrei.
She's
one
of
a
kind.
Look,
if
you
truly
love
her,
don't
think
about
it.
Marry
her
tomorrow
-
-
But
could
she
love
me,
Pierre?
-
She
hardly
knows
me...
I
could
see
it
in
her
face
I've
never
seen
her
and
I've
known
her
She
loves
you,
Andrei.
And
you're
So,
what
are
you
doing
talking
Go
to
her!
Go
to
her,
don't
let
her
get
away.
Propose
to
her.
I
will.
