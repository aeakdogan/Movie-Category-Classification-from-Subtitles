Don't
you
see
Very
sorry,
dear

But...
you
must
do
this
for
us.
You

That
is
correct.
We

killed
six
million
Jews.
Not
enough,

Just

more
minutes.
Colonel?
Well,

leave
the
keys
I've
got

that
runway
You
are
facing
disaster

Just
a
minute.

Captain?
Captain,
this
is
You
cannot

in
our
country.
We
have
enough
trouble
We
have
144
men,
women,
and
children
The
hijacker
has
threatened
But
if
he
does,
Do
you
understand
that,
Mr.
Minister?
My
answer
is
definitely
not.

-

Captain,
what's
this
shouting?
They're
torturing
a
young
boy.
They're
killing
him.
Mr.
Minister,
whether
we
have
your
permission
or
not.
Reducing
power.

Captain,
it's
OK.
But
just
give
me
a
minute.

All
right,
gentlemen.
We'll
go
in
three
sections.
I
want
you

Bobby,
you'll
have
section
three
Move
fast.
It
should
be
a
piece
of
cake.
How
do
we
know
that?
A
calculated
guess.
All
right,
gentlemen.
Any
questions?
Please
help
yourself.

Mama,
it's
so
hot.
I
know,
sweetie.
Everybody's
hot.
What
are
they
doing
there
with
Daddy?

Asking
him
some
questions.
What
kind
of
questions?
Maybe,
uh...
about
being
Jewish.
They
don't
like
Jews,
huh,
Mama?
No,
sweetie,
they
don't
like
Jews.
Open
the
door.
Open
the
door.
Open.

You
move,
move,
move.
Sit
down.


-
Father,
God
be
with
you.
Take
care
of
them.
You
stay.
Ben.
Don't
take
him,
please.
Daddy.
Mommy,

taking
Daddy.
No!
Move,

All
right,
time
to
leave.
We

off.
Where
to?
I
will
let
you
know





We've
been
informed
that
they've
left
Beirut
We
have
reason
to
believe
If
so,
they'll
be

Nick,
I've
just
had
confirmation

Colonel,
General
Woodbridge,
we've

It's
just
the
situation
If
we
wait
any
longer,
I'm
sorry,
Nick.
The
president
If
he
can
release
our
people
that's
what
he
wants
to
do.
So
until
the
negotiations
break
down...
...your
people
are

How
long
do
we
have
to
wait?
Well,
General
Woodbridge
is

Thank
God
the

Yeah.
Nick,
the

Sorry,
McCoy.
We're
still
on
hold.
Damn
it,
Nick.
Everyone
to
the
back!

-

Colonel
Alexander?
They
want
you
on
the
phone.
Alexander
here.
Nick,
it's
a
go.
Gotcha.
McCoy,
it's
a
go.
Take
'em
down.
OK,

Ingrid
Harding,
Mr.
Ambassador,
excuse
me.
-
Yes,
sir.
Miss
Harding,
What's
happening?
The
Algerian
commandos
Oh,
no.
Don't.
All
the
hostages
in
Beirut,
What
hostages?
The
guys
from
the
Navy
when
the
other
hijackers
came
on.
-
What
other
hijackers?
Ten
or
12
of
them.
Oh,
God.
All
sections,
all
sections.
OK,
30
seconds.
All
right?
All
sections!
Let's
go.
Turn
the
light
on.
-
All
sections.

What
the
hell
is
that?
Come
on,
get
out
of
there,
McCoy.
McCoy!
Turn
the
lights!

-
What
the
hell?
Don't
shoot
back!
We're
clearing
out!
Don't
shoot.
Don't
shoot.
-

Oh,
shit.
Take
off
immediately!
Take
off!
-
All
right,
all
right.

Americans,
look
what
you
have
done!
Look
here,
Americans!
Look!
He's
gonna
kill
him.
Now
your
American
president
-
Here
is
a
token
for
him...
...and
the
American
people.
-
One
Marine
killer!
Oh,
Jesus.
Son
of
a
bitch.
Let's
go.
Come
on,
move.
Sorry
I
had
to
do
it
that
way,
boys.
It
was
the
only
way
What
happened,
Colonel?
Twelve
terrorists
got
on
board.
They
were
in
every
corner
of
that
plane
It
would've
been
a
disaster.
He's
an
American.
He
was
in
the
Navy.
Where
do
we
go
from
here?
After
them,
I
hope.
They're
going
back
to
Beirut.
You
mean
it's
all
over
for
us?
On
the
contrary,
Colonel.
The
president
wants
you
Israel?

Israel
is
America's
best
friend
and
it's
only
20
minutes
from
Beirut.
You're
gonna
get
anything
and
everything
The
president
wants
those
people
home.
So
do
we,
General.
So
do
we.
We
are
Americans.
Stay
down.
-
Clear.
Not
bad,
McCoy.
Not
bad.
-
We
can
do
it
in
ten.
Hold
it,
McCoy.
We
got
visitors.
-
Colonel
Alexander?
Good
morning.
I'm
Colonel
Amir
Oh,
yes.
How
are
you?
-
Good
morning,
Major.
-
Can
I
talk
to
you?
Bobby,
take
over.
-
You
got
it,
sir.

So,
what's
happening?

They've
taken
the
hostages
-

Where
to?
They
could
be
spreading
them

That's
bad.
Colonel,
I
assume
your
Mossad
still
has
Your
assumption
is
correct.
I
need
to
get
in
contact
You
mean
you
want
to
get
in
It'd
be
a
great
help
to
us,
Colonel.
If
I
may
suggest...
They've
announced
Of
course.
Now
that
they
they
wanna
manipulate





I
was
in
Beirut
20
years
ago.
It
was
something.
They
had
everything:
It
was
the
Las
Vegas
of
the
Middle
East.
Beirut
was
beautiful
then.
Beautiful.

Hey,
Marine
heroes.
Your
friend.
He
made
the
news.
They
killed
him.
They
killed
Tom.

How
have
they
been
treating
you,
-
Sh!
They're
feeding
us.
I
suppose,
under
the
circumstances,
Where
are
the
others?
It's
true
about
the
selection?
Go
back!


One
more
question!
If
you
try
to
be
clever
with
me,
That'd
make
you
a
real
hero,
Yes,
yes.
Now,
you
go
back
to
the
press,
Now,
ask
your
questions,
please.
-


Belt.
Where'd
you
get
the
stupid
belt?
You
gave
it
to
me
for
my
birthday.
I
did?
I
hope
you
like
it.


So
you're
Canadian.
You're
blessed
I'd
like
to
go
there
myself
one
day.
Well,
it's
a
beautiful
country
here.
Do
you
know
where
we
need
to
go?
Yes,
my
son.
We're
on
our
way.
You'll
need
these.
If
you
look
down
to
your
right,
It
will
lead
you
directly
That
is
where
most
of
the
hostages
are.
Their
headquarters.
The
Jews
are
there.
No,
go
and
do
what
you
have
to
do.
Under
the
seat
you'll
find
something
Don't
take
too
long.
Boss,
aren't
we
trusting
this
guy
The
Israelis
say
And
we
need
someone


Boss.
Boss,
look.
We'd
better
get
outta
here.
Wait.

Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Jesus
Christ,
what
do
we
do
now?
-

Get
the
hell
outta
here.

Shit.
-




-

You
OK,
Butch?
Yeah,
I'm
OK,
boss.
Shit,
that
was
a
close
one,
huh?

It's
already
4:15.

We
had
him
on
the
radio.
He
started
to
say
something.
Well,
I
can't
wait
any
longer.
This
is
Mr.
Samir,
Oh,
good.
We
gotta
get
moving.
Otherwise,
we're
gonna
miss


Uh,
Raffi,
I
just
want
to
thank
I
wish
I
could
join
you.
Well,
you
boys
have
done
it
before.
Good
luck.

All
right,
check
your
gear,
boys:
Let's
go.
Aw,
Jesus,
boss.
She's
had
it.
We've
got
one.
Here
are
some
blankets
for
the
night.
How
about
some
beds?
You
don't
need
beds.
Scott,
that
must
be
them.
About
a
mile
offshore,
I'd
say.
-
You
OK?
Yeah,
good
to
be
on
dry
land.
Well,
we
have
three
targets.
A
school
in
the
northern
part
Do
you
know
where
that
is?
Is
it
the
one
-
Yeah,
right.
And
the
Jews
are
being
held
It's
in
the
center
of
town.
-
Yes,
sir.
And
the
ATW
crew
We'll
have
to
get
them
last.
Right.
And
I
drew
a
map
here.
All
right,
everybody.
We
move
out
in
two
minutes.
Let's
go
right,
partner.

That's
the
place.

Good
luck.

Why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that?
You
hate
me,
huh?
It's
your
government
we
fight,
not
you.
One
day
I
will
go
there.
I
will
drive
a
truck,
and
truck,
it
will
blow.
That'll
be
suicide.
You
know
that.
I
know
how
to
die.
The
White
House
is
a
very
big
place.
You'll
never
get
near
the
place.
Do
you
think
we
don't
have
You
will
be
surprised.
One
day.
One
day.
Delta
Two
in
position.
Ready,
boss?
Let's
do
it.


Cover
us.
One
minute
to
showtime.
Get
ready.
OK,
30
seconds
to
blastoff.
Come
on,
McCoy.




Sleep
tight,
sucker.



Backyard,
Bobby.
Right,
boss.
Gentlemen,
let's
go.

Stop
him!

-
Hey.
American?
American,
do
you
hear
me?
American?
I
want
to
negotiate.
Do
you
hear
me,
American?
Loud
and
clear.
Come
on,
hurry.

-
Get
back!
My
leg!

All
right,
get
down!
Hold
on.
I
got
you.
-
Let
me
help.
I'm
a
medical
student.
He'll
need
help
with
circulation.
McCoy,
what
are
you
doing
up
there?
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
Jump?
I
don't
care
what
you
do.
Make
it
fast.
-
Fast
enough?
They
must
be
delayed
in
the
shelter.


This'll
hold
you
Not
a
local
hospital,
I
hope.
Hey,
am
I
gonna
lose
the
leg?
Don't
worry.
You'll
be
jogging
Let
me
carry
him.
You've
enough
to
do.
Thank
you.
Gentlemen,
Better
hurry.
I
think
there's
-
How
do
you
know?
I
didn't
know
you
spoke
Arabic.
If
we
don't
get
outta
here,
Bobby!
Come
on.
-
Watch
his
leg.

Come
on,
keep
it
moving.
Come
on,
men,
we
gotta
go.

Hit
it.
Move
it,
move
it.
Go!
Goddamn
place
is
empty.
Looks
like
they've
been
here.
-
Come
on.
Let's
go.
-
Delta
One.
Colonel,
by
the
looks
of
it,
The
cells
are,
Looks
like
they've
taken
Then
find
'em,
damn
it.
Any
suggestions,
Delta
One?
Beggin'
the
Colonel's
pardon,
There's
over
two
million
people
here.
You
know
what
to
do,
Pete.
Find
one
that
speaks
English
Come
on,
boys!
You
gotta
move
fast!
Gotta
find
one
who'll
talk.
-
Where'd
you
find
'em
all?
Yeah?
Now,
who
is
your
commanding
officer?
Speak
or
you're
dead.
-
Officer.
You?
You?
Officer?
Come
here.
Get
up.
Open
your
mouth.
Ah,
ah!
-
Ah,
ah,
ah.
Do
you
wanna
live?
Live?
-
Where
did
they
take
the
Americans?
Where
did
they
take
the
Americans?

First
and
ten,
Delta
One.
They
should
be
somewhere
-
Go
after
them.
OK,
let's
move!
Damn.
It's
gonna
be
light
soon.
Take
off,
Nick.
OK.
Then
you
join
Pete.
I'll
see
you
at
the
airport.
I
won't
be
able
to
wait
for
you.
-
Then
don't
wait.
OK,
Bobby,
you
stick
with
the
major.
Then
take
my
vehicle
-
Will
do.
Delta
Two,
this
is
Delta
One.
Over.
-
What's
the
plan,
boss?
-
Just
like
the
old
days.
Delta
Two,
Delta
One.
Come
in.
I'm
gonna
prepare
the
upper
floors.
Yeah,
I'm
here,
Major.

How's
it
goin',
kid?
Well,
those
bastards
snaked
us,
boss.

Watch
your
ass,
Butch,
OK?
Yeah,
I'll
see
you
when
I
see
you,
boss.

-
Bobby.
-
It's
showtime.





Goddamn.
That's
Scott
down
there.
OK,
let's
move!
Let's
go!
Let's
take
'em.

They're
our
guys.
They're
Americans.

Need
a
hand?
Grab
the
wheel!


Cover
us.
Pete.
Pete.
Gimme
that
blanket.
Pete.
-
Take
off
his
clothes.
Jesus...
Pete.
-
You
know
the
way
to
the
airport?
Get
the
hostages
out
of
the
truck
The
Colonel
will
be
waiting
for
you
-
Don't
stop
for
anything,
understand?
I'll
take
your
bike.
-
What
about
you,
Major?
Tell
the
colonel
not
to
wait
for
me.
I
need
more
bandages.


Going
somewhere?


-




Pete.
Hey,
doc.
Get
on
Pete
here.
Keep
it
quiet.
Mike,
bring
my
bag.
-
Looks
like
they're
expecting
us.
We're
gonna
have
to
find
another
way.
Maybe
we
could
cut
Yeah.
Looks
quiet.
How
many
guards
around
the
plane
I'd
say
between
12
and
16.
Six
of
our
men.
-
Oh!

Ah!


-

Do
you
speak
English?

You
wanna
live,
talk
fast.
Jaaffer.
He
is
in
the
plane.
-
How
many
men
does
he
have?
-
Come
on.
What
about
the
hostages?
There
are
only
three,
Do
you
have
a
password?
If
you
wanna
live,
then
use
it.
-
Maybe
he
is
asleep.
Jaaffer
Iben
Khalil.
-
Good
morning.
Good
morning,
gentlemen.
-
It's
about
time.
-
For
what?
You
bet.
Need
anything
else
Yeah.
A
clear
runway.
OK.
All
right,
Jim,
bring
'em
in.
-
Come
on,
gang.
Let's
go!

Sit
down
in
the
rear
and
buckle
up.
Come
on,
move,
move,
move.

Everybody
find
a
seat
fast!

Put
him
in
first
class.
Keep
moving.
If
they're
not
wounded,
Put
him
over
there.
Come
on.
Get
'em
down
there.
Keep
going.
Come
on.
You,
too.

Come
on.
Double
time.
Pull
it!
Where
is
that
McCoy?
-
Intercom
check.
All
right,
Captain.
Let's
wind
this
son
of
a
bitch
up
before
the
whole
of
Beirut
shows
up.
You
got
it.
OK.
High-pressure
start...
number
two.

Come
on.
Let's
go.
Close
that
hatch.
-
Colonel,
what
about
Major
McCoy?
I
gotta
get
these
