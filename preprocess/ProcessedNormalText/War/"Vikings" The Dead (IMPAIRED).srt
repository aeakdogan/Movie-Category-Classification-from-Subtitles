LOTHBROK:
Previously
on
Vikings...
There
is
a
city
called
Paris.
MAN:
I
can
see
that
not
the
living
ODO:
We
are
running
out
of
fresh
food.
The
city
is
beginning
to
starve.
I
believe
we
must
attempt
GISLA:
We
should
never
give
in
Otherwise
we
will
have
failed,
and
The
Franks
want
to
discuss
You
have
all
failed!
I
will
not.
With
no
more
discussion,
He
urges
you
to
accept
the
offer.
5,760
pounds
in
gold
and
silver.
LOTHBROK:
There
is
something
I
also
seek.
I
am
a
dying
man.
I
want
to
be
baptized.

He
says
you
will
go
to
hell,
not
heaven.
That
is
not
your
decision.

?
More,
give
me
more,
give
me
more
?
If
I
had
a
heart
I
could
love
you
?
If
I
had
a
voice
I
would
sing
?
After
the
night
when
I
wake
up
?
I'll
see
what
tomorrow
brings

?
If
I
had
a
voice,
I
would
sing
?

All
the
treasure
is
here,
as
promised.

They
have
met
their
obligations.
The
emperor
expects
and
leave
immediately.


I'll
tell
Ragnar.



They've
brought
the
payment.
-
I
said...

It
makes
no
difference
to
me.
I
am
dying.
But
at
least
I
know,
I
will
see
Athelstan
again.

What
did
I
tell
you,
Rollo?
I
warned
all
of
you.
The
priest
poisoned
Ragnar's
mind
and
now
we
see
the
fruit
of
it.
It's
true.
And
now
I
have
a
heavy
heart.
I
cannot
believe
that
Ragnar
Not
in
his
heart.
You
saw
what
you
saw.
But
you
too,
were
baptized,
Rollo.
It
did
not
change
you.
I
did
not
want
it
to
change
me.
The
gods
protected
me
But
they
refused
to
protect
Ragnar.
-
Why?
His
name
was
Athelstan.
Do
you
think
is
true?
What
they're
saying
about
Ragnar?
-
I
hope
so.
Because
no
Christian
king
will
ever
It's
unthinkable.
An
insult
to
our
gods
and
our
people.
Then
someone
needs
to
kill
him.



Princess
Gisla,
I
want
to
talk
with
you.
Not
now,
Count.
It's
neither
the
time
nor
place
Forgive
me.
Count
Odo,
the
princess
doesn't
seem
You
saved
our
city.
Please,
allow
me

Later,
perhaps.
What
a
day
to
celebrate.
Our
precious
city
is
saved.
We
paid
them
to
go
away.
How
do
you
count
that
a
victory,
Father?
Because
next
time,
We
will
block
the
rivers,
If
only
my
grandfather
was
here.
If
only
Charlemagne
was
here.
How
we
would
rejoice.
Are
you
sure?
Now
I
am
tired.
God
bless
you,
Daughter.
God
bless
Paris.



-
Helga.
-
Yes!
After
such
knowledge,
what
forgiveness?
Oh,
but
you
don't
understand.
-
What
is
there
to
understand?

There
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
be
responsible
You
are
our
king.
Hmm.
For
now.
But
when
your
time
comes,
you
must
lead
with
your
head,
not
with
your
heart.
Can
you
do
that?
Yes,
Father.
I
have
something,

SEER:
If
you
would
truly
see
what
you
would
go
down
now

Where
does
your
husband
My
husband
will
be
I
almost
believe
you.
The
princess
will
not
speak
She
will
speak
with
me,
eventually.
Her
father
will
insist.
She
seems
very
boring.
So
moral.
So
good.
It
is
very
tedious.
You
would
soon
tire
of
her,
Perhaps.
But
then
again,
breaking
her
Is
there
a
way,
that
I
could
keep
your
interest?

Come.
We
will
see.
If
you
would
submit.
To
what?
To
being
chained
up
and
whipped.
Of
course,
I
will
allow
you
Some
are
more
severe
than
others.
You
will
always
be
able
to
call
a
halt,
though
I
would
prefer
to
decide
myself.
It
would
keep
my
interest.
Undoubtedly.
ODO:
Tell
me
when
to
strike.
Say
strike.
Strike.
-


What
are
you
doing?
Ragnar
asked
me
to
build
him
one
last
boat.

It's
almost
a
month
since
we
gave
them
So
why
are
they
still
here?
We
don't
know.
Perhaps
it
is
time
we
found
out.

He
wants
to
know
why
you're
still
here
They
have
honored
their
pledge,
Our
king,
my
father,
Ragnar
Lothbrok,
is
too
weak
and
ill
to
travel.

He
wants
to
see.
Wait.

If
he
dies,
he
has
only
asked
one
thing.

That
he
receive
a
proper
Christian
burial.
Otherwise,
we
will
not
leave.



He
says
you
may
bring
carried
by
unarmed
men.
They
will
say
a
Christian
mass


-


You
can
go
talk
to
him
now.


Who
knows,
Ragnar,
what
the
gods
But
this,
I
can
never
imagine.
If
you
have
gone
to
Heaven,
then
we
will
never
meet
again.
And
yet,
I
think
Odin
will
ride
like
the
wind,
and
rescue
you,
and
take
you
to
Valhalla,
where
you
belong,
my
own
sweet
Ragnar.
And
there,
there
we
shall
meet
again,
and
fight
and
drink
and...
love
one
another.
I've
always
resented
you,
it's
true.
No
point
denying
it.
I'm
sorry
you're
dead,
but...
But
it
happens
to
all
of
us,

It's
just
funny
that
I
always
thought
they
favored
you.
You
thought
so,
too.

Seems
we
were
both
mistaken.
So,
then...
I
made
the
boat
that
took
you
to
fame,
and
I
made
the
boat
that
will
take
you
Give
my
regards
to
Athelstan,
by
the
way.
You
have
betrayed
us.
You
betrayed
your
heritage.
You
betrayed
our
future.
You
betrayed
me!
I
loved
you
more
than
anyone.
I
loved
you
more
than
that
priest
But
it
made
no
difference.
You
always
thought,
"No
need
to
bother
about
Floki".
"He's
just
a
fool."

I
hate
you,
Ragnar
Lothbrok.
And
I
love
you
with
all
my
heart.
Why
do
you
tear
me
away
from
myself?

-
MAN:
Princess!
_
I
win.

-

WOMAN:
The
Princess!

Cut
them!
Go!



SEER:
I
can
see
that
not
the
living
but
the
dead
will
conquer
Paris.


ODO:
Your
Highness,
they
raided
took
what
they
wanted
and
left.
Imperial
Highness.
Your
Highness.
They
have
violated
our
city.
What
is
there
to
say?
All
the
angels
in
heaven
are
weeping.
Father,
get
up.
The
heathens
have
gone.
MEN:
Your
Highness.
Why
did
you
not
tell
us
earlier?
Did
you
not
trust
us?
-
I
did
what
my
father
asked
me
to
do.
It
was
the
way
he
wanted
And
he
succeeded.
Hmm.
He
got
us
into
Paris.
And
now
we
have
even
more
spoils.

We
leave
the
camp
tomorrow
for
home.
But
because
we
intend
on
raiding
it
is
important
to
maintain
I
will
stay.
ROLLO:
No.
You
have
no
reason
to
stay
here,
Floki.
And
what
reason
do
you
have,
Uncle?
Then
it
is
decided.
You
will
winter
here
with
who
decide
to
stay
with
you.
EMPEROR
CHARLES:
It
is
wonderful
These
snails
are
so
plump,
so
juicy.
You
know
that
the
Northmen
The
great
warrior
called
Rollo
But
most
have
gone.
Yes...
But
they
will
return
again.
That
is
why
Rollo
has
remained.
They
will
return
in
the
spring,
probably
in
even
greater
numbers.
Surely
one
of
your
brothers
I
have
been
weak
enough
I
have
begged
and
pleaded
Their
hatred
for
me
and
guiding
principle
of
their
lives.
So,
what
are
we
to
do?
I
will
not
be
known
to
history
as
the
French
emperor
who
presided
over
the
destruction
of
Paris.
I
cannot
and
will
not
allow
such
an
intolerable
fate
You
will
have
to
offer
them

I
will
have
to
offer
them
I
must
offer
them
something
than
gold
or
silver.
I
must
offer
your
hand
in
marriage.
This
is
Count
Odo's
doing.
Just
because
I
refuse
to
marry
him,
he
wants
to
have
me
thrown
to
the
dogs.
Will
you
not
consider
it,
my
child,
I
would
do
almost
anything
I
would
kill
myself
for
the
sake
of
Paris.
But
I
will
not
be
tied
in
holy
matrimony
to
someone
who
is
more
beast
than
man.
Then
I
will
have
to
recall
our
deputation.
You
have
already
sent
Without
even
asking
me?
Without
even
thinking
of
me?
Oh,
Father!
I
am
your
father.
But
I
am
also
the
Emperor
of
Frankia.
And
it
is
not
your
father
it
is
the
emperor.
And
therefore,
you
will
obey
him.
You
will
be
offered
a
vast
area
of
land
The
emperor
will
also
make
you
a
duke,
the
highest
honor
he
can
bestow.
You
will
be
very
rich,
and

The
Emperor
also
offers
of
his
beautiful
daughter,
Princess
Gisla.
What
must
I
do
in
return?

You
will
defend
Paris
against
your
brother.
