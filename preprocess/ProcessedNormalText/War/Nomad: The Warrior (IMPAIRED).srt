Man's
voice:
a
great
Asian
region
has
been
home
nomadic
tribesmen
roaming
Since
the
time
Genghis
Kahn,
hordes
of
foreign
invaders
and
put
an
end
Of
all
those
who
threaten
none
were
more
brutal,
more
relentless
than
the
fierce



Man's
voice:
The
Jungars
Our
tribal
leaders
could
not
unite
So
many
fled
from
the
horrors
of
war
the
"Flight
with
Bloody
Feet."
Many
of
us
remain,
hoping
to
see
the
fulfillment
a
warrior
descendent
of
Genghis
Kahn
in
a
revolt
against
our
enemies.
/,
Oraz,
have
always
believed
and
I
have
searched
far
and
wide
Surround
him.
Man:
Are
you
the
one
Yes,
I
am
Oraz.
The
Great
Khan
of
all
Jungars,
Galdan
You
may
tell
your
Great
Khan
and
I
do
not
have
to
obey
his
command.
Such
words
can
cause
a
man's
death.
However,
my
orders
-
Take
him.
Man:
You
are
wise,
Oraz.
You
know
that
if
we
return
without
you,
That
would
be
unfortunate.
I
would
not
wish
I
have
found
him,
Great
Kahn.
So
you
are
Oraz.
I
have
heard
much
about
you.
It
is
said
that
you
understand
-
Is
this
true?
Although
you
won't
deny
People
say
that
as
well.
Perhaps
then
you
will
the
finest
of
the
herd.

Oraz:
The
chestnut
stallion
that
is
the
best
horse,
a
horse
fit
for
a
Great
Khan
Do
you
know
what
awaits
you
-
!
Hey,
Kazakh.
By
God,
you're
right.
The
horse
you
chose
You
are
right,
Kazakh.
You're
gifted.
And
for
this,
I
will
make
you
the
master
of
my
stables
and
pay
you
your
weight
in
gold.
Oraz:
Gold
cannot
replace
freedom,
Beware
of
your
words,
Oraz.
My
path
has
already
been
and
I
must
follow
it.
You
speak
with
such
How
brightly
will
my
star
keep
burning?
You
know
yourself
even
stars
fall
from
the
skies,
Wise
one,
this
new
star-
I
must
know,
tell
me
his
name.
I
will
know
that
when
I
find
him.
Oraz:
Whatever
perils
/
never
lost
hope.
One
day
I
asked
the
almighty,
"
Creator,
the
fearless
warrior
and
drive
this
foe
from
our
land?"


At
that
moment,
I
heard
a
child
cry
and
suddenly,
I
knew
had
just
been
born.

Danger!
Danger,
Great
Kahn!
Oh,
great
Galdan,
I've
had
a
terrible
vision
who
will
one
day
cross
your
path
You
must
hunt
down
this
wolf
cub
So
the
Kazakh
was
right.
Sharish,
find
this
Kazakh
child
-
and
kill
it.
-
!
-
As-salaam-alaikum.
The
child
of
the
prophecy.

Are
you
looking
for
someone,
Oraz?
I
have
already
found
him.
Jungars!

Jungars!
Protect
the
carriage.


Give
me
the
child.
Hurry.

Hey,
Kazakhs!
Leave
him!
I
will
kill
him
myself.

Where
is
the
child?
There
is
no
child
here.

As-salaam-alaikum,
Sultan.
Ah.
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Talk.
Sultan:
I'll
listen
to
you.
Jungars
attacked
the
caravan
I
know.
They've
all
been
killed,
my
wife
and
my
son.
Your
son
lives.
I
was
able
to
save
the
boy.

My
boy.
How
will
I
repay
you,
Oraz?
I'm
used
to
traveling
light,
Sultan.
I
cannot
let
you
go
without
some
reward.
Ask
me,
what
do
you
wish?
Give
me
your
son.
How
can
your
tongue
I
haven't
let
the
Jungar
know
There
is
no
safer
place
here
in
my
palace.
Somebody
told
the
Jungar
They
were
looking
for
him.
You
ask
for
that
Go
and
raise
him
a
good
warrior.
Remember,
keep
your
back
straight.
Keep
your
heels
down.
Feel
the
rhythm
of
the
horse.
Feel
his
spirit.
The
horse
is
a
Kazakh's
best
friend.
He
is
your
wings.
You
must
learn
to
take
good
care
of
him.
Oraz:
I
gathered
them
/
picked
only
the
best,
They
all
worked
hard
but
two
boys
outshined
all
the
others.
Mansur
and
his
best
friend
Erali.
/
was
the
only
one
who
knew
that
one
of
them
-
Let's
go.
-
How
many
eyes
does
a
nomad
have?
Four.
Two
in
front
and
two
behind.
All:
As-salaam.
Tell
me
your
names
and
tribes.
-
Barak,
Agai
tribe.
-
Azamat,
Tursyn.
-
Mansur,
I'm
a
Kazakh.
-
Ere,
Uzbek.
-
Eren,
Alighe
tribe.
Don't
you
know
the
name
of
your
tribe?
Mansur
and
I
say
Kazakh.
These
boys
are
the
hope
of
our
nation.
You
have
trained
good
students.
Well
done.
Let's
move
on

You
are
growing
older
and
older,
my
friend.
I
ask
you,

Great
One,
in
the
memory
of
our
deceased
ancestors,
that
our
land
be
free
Our
ancestors
roamed
Once,
long
ago,
the
nomads
led
by
the
great
Attila
the
mightiest
of
empires
in
the
West.
In
the
East,
they
took
China.
But,
most
of
all,
they
loved
their
land,
and
they
always
came
back.
And
the
Kazakh
roamed
after
the
spring,
together

Oraz:
No
one
has
yet
written
Only
the
elders
tell
of
our
warriors
I
want
you
to
know
and
to
swear
loyalty
to
each
other.
Our
colt
was
born
Mansur:
He's
a
good
horse,
Gahar.
What's
his
name?
-1
call
him
Moonchild.
Why
are
you
looking
at
me?
You're
the
one
who's
looking.
No,
I'm
not.
It's
you.
Hey,
Kazakh,
come
out
and
fight.
Or
are
you
a
coward?
Mansur,
don't
you
recognize
us?
-
Erali,
is
that
you?
I'm
not
scared
of
anything.
Let's
go!
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Straight...
Oraz:
the
mighty
Jungar
army
Meanwhile,
my
boys
had
grown
up.
Honored
Oraz,
Sultan
Wali
requests
that
you
accompany
him
That's
enough.
I'm
gonna
beat
you.
Perhaps.
Man:
Gather,
everyone.
Almighty,
let
the
horses
be
strong.
Let
the
land
be
prosperous.
Let
my
people's
spirit
rise.
May
our
enemies
be
overcome.
Let
the
game
begin.
-
Amen.

Yes!
If
we
do
not
reach
an
agreement
soon,
That
is
why
I've
called
Tell
us
what
you
are
suggesting,
One
of
us
should
be
and
an
alliance
must
be
formed.
I
suggest
we
unite
with
the
I
submit
to
no
one.
Abulkhair,
I'm
certain
we
will
lose
our
freedom.
The
Kazakhs
have
subject
to
no
law
If
we
are
to
die,
let
us
die
free.
Honored
Barak,
but
we
must
join
together
-
as
the
prophecy
decrees.
-
It's
an
insult.
Abulkhair:
Now
what?


Mansur,
are
you
asleep?
-
No.
My
heart
is
bursting.
I
have
not
been
able
to
sleep
all
night.
Something's
happened
to
me,
What?
What
is
it?
I
feel-
I
feel
dizzy
as
if
I
am
high
above
And
your
knees
tremble,
and
you
walked
along
the
bank
-
and
wanted
to
shout
out
loud.
I
now
realize
the
kind
of
woman
In
other
words,
you
are
in
love.
Yes.
It
happened
on
the
swing.
She
was
next
to
me.
Her
eyes
and
her
voice.
Why
did
I
not
notice
it
before?
-
As-salaam-alaikum.
I
see
sadness
in
your
eyes,
my
son.
You
should
look
into
my
eyes.
You
will
see
an
even
greater
sadness.
Our
hopes
for
uniting
have
collapsed.
You
and
Erali
are
like
my
two
hands.
And
now
much
is
expected
of
you.
Oh,
misery!
I
bring
terrible
news.
Darkness
falls
over
the
land,
a
curse
on
the
reign

I
bring
news,
my
lord,
terrible
news.
Great
Galdan,
my
master
and
protector,
your
wisdom
and
truly
magnificent,
but
the
child,
the
one
from
the
prophecy,
He
lives.
Woe
to
us
all.
He
will
bring
ruin
to
the
Jungars.
Your
mighty
star
will
be
extinguished,
and
put
an
end
to
his
life.
Now
this
Kazakh
will
die.
!
I
haven't
seen
Moonchild
in
ages.
-
He's
grown.
Here.
You
dropped
it
from
the
swing.
You
can
keep
it
if
you
want.
I
can't.
Why?
Because
my
friend
loves
you.
I
know.
He
is
like
a
brother
to
me.
Me
too,
but
I'm
not
your
sister.
You
have
the
scent
of
the
moon.
Does
the
moon
have
a
scent?
Black
flag-
Gahar:
Protect
him,
Almighty.
Oraz:
The
Jungar
army
laying
waste
to
our
land,
enslaving
the
women.
It
would
not
be
long
the
walls
of
Turkistan.
We
cannot
leave
Turkistan
to
the
enemy.
If
we
survive,
we
can
rebuild
the
city.
Now
we
must
think
about
saving
lives.
And
who
would
lead
us
into
battle?
You
have
a
son,
Sultan.
Where
is
he,
Oraz?
When
will
I
see
him?
How
will
I
recognize
him?
You
wanted
your
son
Warriors
are
recognized
in
battle.
I
will
come
back.
You
go
with
them.
We
will
find
you.
Mansur:
Moonchild,
Look
after
your
sister.
Did
you
talk
to
her?
No,
I
did
not.
Did
you?
We
will
let
fate
decide.
Our
earth
oil
burns
well.
The
children
and
the
others
Only
those
who
There
are
ancient
Meant
for
escape?
We
can
all
vanish
without
a
trace.
Do
the
Jungars
know
about
it?
Unfortunately,
often
they
know
more
-
Here,
give
her
to
me.
Stay
with
your
brother.
Zenep,
Zenep,
I'm
going
back.
Why?
Whatever
happens,
What
about
us?
You're
safe
now.
The
gorge
is
there.
Gahar,
Gahar!
Kasim,
Kasim!
Stop
her.
She's
leaving
us.
-
Gahar:
Why
are
you
following
me?
Gahar:
Well,
I
order
you
-1
will
not
let
you
go
alone.
-


Sharish:
Where
are
you
going
and
why?
-1
will
not
tell
you.
I
will
sooner
die.

-
He's
still
a
child.
He's
my
brother.
Do
you
want
to
save
his
life?
If
you
marry
me,
I
will
let
him
live,
and
you
will
bear
me
a
real
warrior.
Your
brother
will
stay
with
me.
If
you
harm
yourself
in
any
way,
cursing
your
name.
Take
her
to
our
camp.
Woman:
To
be
the
wife
is
an
honor
that
very
few
!
It's
good
to
cry.
A
woman's
tears
wash
away
Aww...

Hurry
and
prepare
her.
She
must
be
ready
when
my
son
Man:
We
cannot
take
We
must
ask
Galdan
No.
I
will
take
the
town
myself.
The
Kazakhs
will
never
surrender.
I
suggest
you
make
another
proposal.
I
propose
a
fight:
One
against
one.
You
win,
we
leave.
We
win,
you
surrender.
There
will
be
a
duel
If
the
Kazakh
wins,
they
leave.
If
the
Jungar
wins,
we
will
surrender
without
a
fight.
I
think
we
should
accept
it.
Did
they
give
the
name
of
their
warrior?
-
It's
Sharish.

May
I
speak,
Teacher?
You
taught
us
to
fight
any
opponent.
-
And
today
we
are
all
ready.
You'll
be
satisfied
with
me,
Teacher.
Bless
me.
I
believe
you,
Erali.
But
Mansur
will
fight
Sharish.

It
was
Sharish
that
killed
your
mother.
Man:

Almighty,
Let
the
spirit
of
his
grandfather
Ablai
-
Amen.
Did
you
pray,
Kazakh?
For
you
are
about
to
die.
Am
I?
You
tried
this
20
years
ago.
-







-

Hoo-ah!
!




Erali!
Erali!
-
What's
wrong?
Gahar?
We
have
to
free
her.

Forgive
me
for
not
being
able
I'm
proud
of
you.
I
did
my
duty.
I
avenged
my
mother.
Tell
me
about
her.
I
will.
I
promise
you.
You
mother
was
a
noble
woman.
My
son.
Oraz:
Messengers
were
sent
to
announce
that
Hope
began
to
stir
And
they
gave
their
Ablai.
-

Ablai
will
see
no
one.
I
am
Erali!
So
be
it.
Erali...
I'm
leaving.
What
happened?
I
must
go.
Erali,
we
have
to
be
together.
I
need
you.
Did
you
know
from
the
beginning
No,
I
didn't.
And
it
makes
no
difference
to
us.
You
were
a
brother
to
me.
And
you
are
still
a
brother
to
me.
Well,
if
I
am
still
a
brother
to
you...
then
you
will
understand.
I
didn't
tell
him
anything,
Teacher.
You
did
the
right
thing.
He
mustn't
leave
the
city.
Your
noble
heart
knows
its
course.
I
do
not
have
a
noble
heart.
It's
just
that
I
love
her.
Erali:
Goodbye.
Forgive
me,
my
boy.


Why
didn't
you
stop
him,
Teacher?
Oraz:
I
cannot
change
his
destiny.
He
was
born
to
help
you
I
don't
understand.
What
is
my
mission?
You
were
chosen
by
the
stars
who
will
unite
all
Kazakhs.
I
shall
be
leaving
you
tomorrow.
Why?
There
comes
a
time
when
a
young
eagle
onto
the
rocky
mountain...
to
see
how
he
flies.
Is
there
anything
else
I
need
to
know?
Be
aware
of
betrayal.
Great
Galdan!
Sharish
has
been

Great
Khan!
The
Kazakhs
send
us
this.
Open
it.
They
killed
him?
A
new
Kazakh
warrior
has
appeared.
They
call
him
Ablai.
Ablai
is
Mansur!
I
warned
you
to
kill
this
child.
So,
he
does
exist.

Silence!
I
will
avenge
him!
I
will
avenge
him.

What
news
do
you
bring?

Mansur/Ablai's
voice:
I've
come
to
you
for
strength.
/
pray
for
wisdom
from
my
ancestors,
and
I
pray
for
the
safety
Erali,
Gahar.
Where
are
they
now?
/
need
their
help.
And
I
miss
them...
-


Man:
Do
not
kill
him!
Galdan
wants
him
alive.
Man:
These
new
weapons
-
Sanji.
Can
you
use
these
on
the
Kazakhs?
Yes,
Galdan.
Easily.
-



The
enemy
is
ours!
-
Victory!

It
has
always
been
to
treat
one's
host
with
respect.
We
Kazakhs
put
our
hand
upon
our
heart
when
crossing
a
stranger's
threshold.
But
how
am
I
to
do
that
I
see
that
you
respect
But
where
is
it
written
that
a
warrior
It
is
I
who
captured
you!
So
I
will
cut
your
head
off
You
brother
was
an
enemy
of
my
people.
And
I
killed
him
in
a
fair
fight.
I
will
honor
the
commandments
Genghis
Khan's
captured
descendant
But
he
can
be
forced
to
face
our
trials.
If
you
pass,
I
will
let
you
go.
But
if
you
do
not
pass,
It's
your
choice.

Moonchild!
Hey!
Hey,
where
did
you
get
that
horse?
It
was
my
father
It
belonged
to
the
Kazakh
girl.
Take
care
of
him.
He's
a
good
horse.
Give
him
some
yellow
grass.

Hy-ah!



How
did
that
man
know
my
horse's
name?
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
Moonchild
recognized
him
too.
That
can't
be.
-
It's
impossible.
What
else
did
he
say?
-
He
told
me
he
was
a
good
horse.
-
How?

Mansur/Ablai's
voice:
/
would
rather
die
in
battle.
Almighty,
help
me
defend
my
honor
Soldier:
Get
up.
Get
up!
Time
to
fight.




Man:
Come
on,
pay
up.
The
Kazakh
won.
He
won
again.
-
Isn't
that
your
horse?
Untie
him.

Moonchild.
God
protect
him.
Mansur-
please.



You
proved
that
you
are
Before
you,
no
one
has
According
to
our
laws,
-1
must
now
set
you
free.
He
must
be
killed!
Otherwise,
the
spirit
of
Sharish
I
respect
your
grief,
If
we
break
our
own
laws,
and
the
bond
between
the
living
What
choice
do
I
have?


The
prisoner
must
die
in
a
duel.
And
there
is
one
who
can
defeat
him.
Huh?
-
Where
is
the
prisoner?
Where
are
you
going?
I
have
food
for
the
Kazakh.
No!
You
cannot
pass.

Galdan
Who
are
you?
I
am
Hocha,
Galdan's
daughter.
You
were
magnificent
the
other
day.
Just
as
you
were
I
am
honored
to
hear
such
praise
Unfortunately,
you
are
doomed.
They
will
not
let
you
live
You
could
lose
your
head
I
have
already
lost
my
head.
I
have
long
waited
for
a
warrior
I
know
a
way
to
save
you.
If
you
marry
me,
Thank
you,
but
I

He

Tomorrow,

Man:
You

never
see
yours.
Put
it
on.

Begin.



Damn
the
evil!
No!
Curse
you,
Kazakh!

I
knew
it
was
you
Don't

the
enemy.
Do

blame
yourself.
We

done
what
Gahar
is
here.
Save
her.



No!
Bury
him
with
the
honor
he
is
due.
It
will
be
so.
I
promised
you
your
freedom.
And
you
shall
have
it-
tomorrow.
Show
him
to
the
tent
for
honored
guests.
Tonight,
we
will
celebrate
his
victory!

More,
my
poisonous
friend.
I
need
enough
venom
to
kill
a
horse.
Almighty
One,

-
Is
there
enough?
For
you,
honored
warrior.
Mansur!
It's
poison!
-

Get
on,
quick!

Gahar:
Come
on,
Moonchild!
Mansur/Ablai's
voice:
How
can
it
be
that
birds
like
best
friends
that
are
forced
to
kill
one
another?
Oraz's
voice:
Like
night
and
day,
good
and
evil
are
always
together.
Someone
must
give
his
life
in
the
name
of
love
and
justice.
-
Why
are
you
looking
at
me?

I
am
not.
You
remember
I
told
you
Do
you
know
what
I
really
wanted
to
say?
I
wanted
to
say...
I
love
you.

-

I
sent
messengers
to
all
the
tribes.
-
And
the
troops?
What
is
wrong
with
us,
Father?
We
Kazakhs
are
not
helping
My
son-
It
takes
time.
Tribes
are
trying
to
gather
Yes.
I
hope
that
you're
right.
I'll
stall
for
time.
Honored
Ablai,
we
filled
Very
good.
What
were
you
doing
there?
I
want
to
fight
the
enemy
too,
Master.
You're
too
young.
I
don't
have
a
family.
-
What
do
they
call
you?
Erali,
come
and
stay
with
me,
hmm?
Mm-hmm.
Man:

Almighty,
Grant
that
with
our
help
we
may
survive.
The
Kazakhs
have
sent
a
messenger.
Tear
him
to
pieces!
Do
it!

-


That
is
our
fate
I
give
them
until
morning
to
surrender.
Mansur/Ablai's
voice:
what
awaits
the
Jungars
tomorrow.
But
this
battle
can
only
be
won
working
together
as
one.
/
pray
that
they
arrive
in
time.

Honored
Ablai,
But
he's
two
days
away.
He's
trying
to
get
across.
Get
some
rest.
Don't
worry.
I
saved
it.
Take
care
of
our
child.

Khan:
Raze
the
city
to
the
ground!
Take
no
prisoners!
As
for
Ablai,
I
command
you
They
will
kill
all
of
us.
Honored
Ablai,
-
We
have
to
wait.
Until
they
are
closer.
Son,
we
could
all
escape
There
is
no
escape.
I
ordered
them
filled
with
earth
oil.
Honored
Ablai!
-
The
Sultan
is
sending
men

I
don't
know-
He
is
We'll
fight
to
the
death.
All
great
spirits
of
Kazakh
warriors,
help
us
today
Why
are
we
fleeing?
We
have
them
outnumbered
Cowards!
Stop
running!
Fight
to
the
death!
All
of
you!
Stop!
We
are
Jungars!
Man:
The
tribes
are
here!
Let
us
fulfill
our
destiny.
-
Amen.

Cowards!
Traitors!
Fight

To
the
death!
Fight!
Kill
Ablai!
Bring
me
his
head!


Oraz:
The
battle
lasted
100
days
and
100
nights.
Blood
flowed
like
rivers
As
they
fought
this
epic
battle,
my
people
finally
as
our
forefathers
had
under
This
is
how
we
conquered
the
Jungars...
who
had
never
known
defeat.
Boy:
Let
me
go!

Man:
Shall
I
kill
him,
Ablai?
Kazakhs
don't
kill
children.
Bring
him
along.
This
sword
belonged
to
the
great
Khan,
defender
of
our
land.
You
are
his
descendant.
And
now
that
you
have
the
Kazakh
people
I
will
be
worthy
of
their
trust.
All
Kazakhs!
All:
Ablai!
Ablai!
Ablai!
Ablai!
Ablai!
Ablai!
Man
#1:
Who
are
you?
Man
#2:
Messengers
with
a
special
trust.

Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Come
here,
my
boy.


Ah...
-
What
is
in
the
sack?
It
is
the
face
of
the
earth.
Here
are
the
Tian
Shan
Mountains.
Here
live
the
Indians
and
the
Afghans.
And
this
is...
Ka-za-khia.
It
is
immense.
-Who
sent
this?
"From
this
day
forth,
must
know
that
from
the-"
Mansur's/Ablai's
voice:
all
Jungars
and
enemies
of
our
people
must
know
that
from
to
the
Aral
Sea
lies
a
land
by
the
Kazakhs
since
ancient
times.
All
who
dare
to
encroach
upon
this
land
will
be
beaten
and
driven
out
as
was
done
to
the
Jungars.
We
will
greet
our
friends
but
to
our
enemies,
Ablai
Khan."
