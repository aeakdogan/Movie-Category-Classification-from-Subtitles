I

Hi!

Aahh
O,
look
you
have
Heterochromia

-
Sorry
what?
Hmmm,
Right.
Don't
talk
to
me
you
did
that
on
purpose
-
I
did
not!
Why
would
I
do
it
on
purpose?

If
I'm
stressed
or
I'm
tired..

What

you.
You're
stunning!
Looking
like
this?

Blue?
-
You're
my
oldest
friend.
Thank
you
for
that.
Well?
I'm
incapable
of
even
thinking
of
you
that
way,
Anything
else
would
just
feel
wrong
-
But
what
if
you
didn't
know
me?
God,
I
don't
know
what's
got
into
you
lately?
I'm
sleepy.
I
can't,
I
have
my
thesis
coming
up,
I
have
to
study.
Well
fine,
you
got
your
thesis
To

aberration.

Do
you
want
me
to
call
the

So
where
did
you
get
it
from?
He
recommended
your
bank.
Understood.
Yes.
And
you
should
know
mine.
This
gold
is
all
that
is
left
of
my
people.
Melted
from
their

This
is
blood

And
you're
going
to

me

Don't
touch
that
alarm.
I
want

Klaus
Schmidt.

Where
is
he?
Not
that

Thank
you.

Another
day

the
office
Is
that
Colonel
Hendry?

The
NATO
guy?
Yes
it
is.
Cause
that's
three
mob
bosses,,
the
Italian
ambassador
They
can't
all
be
communists.

Do
you
see
that?
Wow,
very
nice.
Wha...what
are
you
doing?
Here's
things
that
the
CIA
didn't
give
me.
Stay
put.
-
Colonel
Hendry?
Emma
Frost,
And
where
is,
Mr.
Shaw?
We're
having
a
party,
and
here's
the
entertainment.

Hello
beautiful,
how
are
you?
Hey
baby,
you
want
to
find
a
quiet
place?
I
am
so
sorry.
Excuse
me.
-
Make
sure,
we
can't
get
a
refill,
Bob?
So,
I
hear
you
blocked
the
proposal
to
position
-
I
expect
you'll
reconsider.
You
put
our
nukes
in
Turkey,
and
you're
looking
at
war.



I
didn't
ask
for
favors,
Colonel.
So,
let
me
say
it
again.
The
only
thing
I
will
reconsider,

What
the
hell
did
you
put
in

now,
MacTaggert.
Sir,
I...!
Have
you
lost
your
mind?
So,
now
what?
We
find
an
expert
on
Genetic
Mutation.
Professor
of
genetics,
Charles
Francis
Xavier.
So,
how
does
it
feel
to
be
a
professor?
Well
ah,
don't
call
me
that.
You

I
know,
but
it
suits
you.

Let's
go
have
a
drink.
VILLA
GESELL,
ARGENTINA
-
Good
afternoon,
my
friends!
-
Hot,
is
not
it?
One
beer,
please.

-
German
beer.
Yes,
it's
Bitburger.
You
like
it?
The
best.
What
brings
you
to
Argentina?
The
climate,
I'm
a
pig
farmer.
I
am
a
tailor,
Have
been
my
whole
life.
My
father
made
the
finest
suits
in
Dsseldorf.
My
Parents
were
from,
Dsseldorf.
-
What
was
their
name?
It
was
taken
away
from
them...
...by
pig
farmers...
...and
tailors.
"Blood
and
Honor".
Which
would
you
care
to
shed
first?
-
We
carried
out
the
orders.

-
Do
not
move,
asshole!



Who,
what
are
you?
Let's
just
say
I'm
Frankenstein's
monster.
I'm
looking
for
my
creator.

Drink,
drink,
drink!

Woowwwww.....
yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh,
I'm
so
proud
of

you.
-
Congratulations,
Professor!
-
No,
on
your
presentation.
How
nice
of
you,
thank
you
very
much.

Moira
MacTaggert.
Do
you
have
a
minute?
For
a
pretty
little
beam
with
a
I
say,
MCR-1,
you
would
say,
It's
a
mutation,
it's
a
very
groovy
mutation.
Mutation
you
know,
took
us
from
single
to
the
dominate
form...
You
know
what,
this
routine
may
go
over
great
-
What?
All
right.
The
kind
that
of
mutations
that
you
were
I
need
to
know
if
they
may
already
have
happened.
In
people
alive
today.
Professor?
I
think
that
we
should
just
talk
when
you're
sober.
Do

you
have
any
time
tomorrow?
Something
tells
me,
you
already
know
This
is
very
important
to
me.
And
if
I
can
help
you,
I
will
do
my
utmost.
Thank
you.
MIAMI,
FLORIDA
-
Still
drinking
champagne,
Bob?
Okay,
well
so
much
for
the
pleasantries.
I
was
wondering,
who
you
told
No
one.
-
He's
telling
the
truth.
Well
I
guess
we're
done
here.
Well
I
knew
better
than
to
trust
you.
Now
you
let
me
walk
out
of
here
Or
I
will
pull
this
pin
and
we
all
die.
Go
ahead,
pull
it.
I'll
do
it,
I
swear
to
god.
No
you
won't.
But
I
will.



You're
one
of
them?
Very
astute
of
you,
Colonel
Hendry.
I've
got
the
power
to
absorb
energy.
That's
the
boring
part.
The
fun
stuff
is

I
can

you
very
much.
MacTaggert,
you
really
think
that
some
crackpot
scientist,
is
going
to
make
me
believe
in
sparkly
dames
You
just
brought
yourself
a
one
way
ticket
This
meeting
is
over.
Uh,
please
sit
down
agent,
MacTaggert.
I
didn't
really
expect
you
to
believe
me.
Given
that
all
you
could
think
about
during
my
presentation,
was
what
sort
of
pie
they
were
serving
in
the
commissary.
It's
apple
pecan.
I
haven't
been
entirely
honest
with
you,
and
I'm
sorry.
You
see,
one
of
the
many
spectacular
things

mind.
I've
seen
this
before
in
a
magic
show.
Are
you
going
to
ask
us
to
think
of
a
number
No,
agent
Stryker.
Although
I
could
ask

you
about
your
son
William
who
which
is
very
nice
But
I
think
I'd
rather
ask
you
...missiles
America
are
currently
placing
in
Turkey.
He's
a
goddamn
spy!
I
did
not,
I
would
never
bring
one
here!


How's
that
for
a
magic
trick?
Best
I've
ever
seen.
I
want
them
out
of
here.
And
lock
down
until
I
can
figure
out
My
facility
is
off
site.
I'll
take
them.
I
can't
believe
this.
You'd
think
the
director
of
the
CIA
We
should
be
going
after
Shaw
right
now,
but...
...instead
he's
up
there
worrying
about
the
wrong
mutants.
What
are
we
doing
to
do,
Lavene?
Lavene?
Absolutely
nothing,
I've
just
frozen
him
for
the
It's
good,
isn't
it?
I'm
as
interested
in
this
Sebastian
Shaw
as
you
are,
..and
if
you
still
want
my
help,
meet
me
on
I've
always
known
that
there
were
people
like
I've
been
the
laughing
stock
of
this
agency
-
You're
going
to
love
my
facility.
-
That's
going
to
have
to
wait.
Agent
MacTaggert
has
to
lead
us
to
Sebastian
Shaw,
and
if
we
don't
move
now
apparently
What?
Not
only
can
he
read
minds,
Moria
and
I
have
just
had
a
lovely
conversation.
-
Yes,
we
did.
But
I
cannot
take
you
anywhere
else,
-
Would
you
like
to
see
one
more
magic
trick?
-
Get
in
the
car.


Herr
Doctor...
the
same
old
Erik
Lensherr.
He's
here
to
kill
you.
What
kind
of
greeting
is
that?
After
so
many
years?
Emma...
We
don't
harm
our
own
kind.
Ah,
now
it's
a
party.
This
is
the
US
Coast
guard.
Stay
where
you
are.
They
have
a
telepath.
I've
lost,
Shaw!
I've
lost,
I've
lost,
Shaw.
There's,
there's
something
blocking
me.
I
think
there's
someone
like
-
Like
you?
This
is
incredible,
I
can
actually
feel
I'm
very
sorry,
but
I
don't
think
I'm
You're
on
your
own.


-
Oh
my
god.
Get
inside.

Stop,
stop,
stop!
Charles!
You
okay?
There's
someone
else
out
there.
There!
Time
to
go.
Let
go!
Better
let
it
go!
You've
got
help
him...there's
Let
it
go!
You
can't,
you'll
drown.
I
know
what
this
means
to
you
Please,
Erik,
calm
your
mind.
Get
off
of
me,
get
off!
Calm
down,
We're
here!
-
Who
are
you?
You
were
in
my
head.
How
did
you
do
that?
You
have
your
tricks,
I
have
mine.
I'm
like
you,
just
calm
your
mind.
-
I
thought
I
was
alone.
Erik,
you're
not
alone.
Secret
CIA
base.
Welcome
to
my
facility.
My
mission
has
been
to
investigate
the
application
of
paranormal
powers
Or
offense.
This
guy,
Shaw,
Schmidt,
whatever
He's
working
with
the
Russians.
We
might
need
your
help
to
stop
them.
Marvelous.
So
we're
to
be
the
CIA's
new
Something
like
that.
It's
a
supersonic.
The
most
advanced
plane
You
should
see
it
in
real
life.
Hank,
these
are
the
special
new
recruits
I
This
is,
Hank
McCoy,
One
of
our
most
talented
young
researchers.
How
wonderful,
another
mutant.
-
Why
didn't
you
say?
Because
you
don't
know.
I
am
so,
so
terribly
sorry!
Hank?
You
didn't
ask,
so
I
didn't
tell.
So

your
mutation's
what?
I'll
say,
Hank
here
graduated
honors
at
the
age
of
fifteen.
I
wish
that's
all
it
was.
You're
among
friends
now,
Hank.
Splendid.
-
Sorry.
Wow
tadaa
-
You're
amazing.
:
The
presence
of
U.S.
missiles
in
Turkey
to
the
people
of
the
Soviet
Union.
Warned
Russian
Mister
Gromeko,
earlier
today
But
he
was
quick
to
insist
the
Russians
Yeah,
we'll
fix
that
as
soon
as
-
Unless
the
CIA
finds
us
first.
If
that
telepath
gets
inside
your
head,
Already
in
hand,
my
love.
The
Russians...
...made
me
this.
So,
what
am
I
thinking?
I
don't
know.
I
was
thinking
that
you
are
the
most
exquisite
And
that
this
needs
ice.
Fetch
me
some.
There's
a
good
girl.

I,
I
promised
myself
I'd
find
a
cure.
You
have
no
idea
what
I'd
give
to
feel...
-
...normal.
Charles
has
never
understood.
He's
different,
but
he's
never
had
to
hide.
Hank
this
serum
that
you're
making,
Just
appearance.
Yeah.
Do
you
think
it
would
work
on
me?
I
can
look
into
it,
if
you'd
like.
That's
the
least
I
can
do
after
asking
you
to
I
have
to
admit,
usually
when
guys
ask
me
out
they're
S..sorry,
I
didn't
intend
to
be
forward.
You
know,
the
nature
of
your
mutation.
If
any
genes
hold
the
key
to
changing
appearance,
Hank,
you
aren't
being
forward,
-
No,
but
I'm
just
sorry
if
you
thought
I
was.
Go
ahead,
take
the
blood.
Sorry,
Does
that
hurt
you?
Kinky!
By
the
way,
if
I
looked
like
you,
of
what
I
know
about
you,
I'm
surprised
-
What
do
you
know
about
me?
Then
know
to
stay
out
of
my
head.
I'm
sorry
Erik,

What
was
that?
I
don't
know,
but
something
doesn't
feel
right.

-
No

of

What
is
that?
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

-
woahhowwwhhh
We
have
an
intruder
on

Where
are
the

Of

you
will,

get
back,

are

Put
that

down

we

Stay
here
my

-
Get
back!

Wait,
wait,
you
want
the

Just
let
us
normal
people
go.
We're
no

Where's

Stop,

Good
choice.
So
tell
me

Well,
I
adapt
to

So
I
guess
I'm
coming
with

it!
Do
it.

It's
a
noble
gesture.
Adapt
to
this.

We'll
have

Yes?
Well
we
can't
stay

Even
if
they
reopen

We've
got
nowhere
to
go.
Yes,
we
do.
The

The

Honestly
Charles,
I
don't
know

of
sort.
You
don't
think
I'm
going
to
blow
though
the
walls?
No,
he
had
this
place
built
to
I
think
it
can
handle
you,
Alex.
You
know
when
I
do
this,
It's
because
you
can't
control
it.
That's
why
we're
here,
Alex.



What
you're
doing
is
incredible.
You're
hitting

was
about

It
is
that
struggle
which
is
holding
you
back.
Jekyll

Of

should
I

Whenever
you're

I
will
teach
you
to

You're

will
work.
Anything
is

I'm
done
here.
Come
on,
Hank.
If
you're
using

the
concentration
to
look
normal.
Then
you're
only
half
paying
attention
to

pointing
out
something
that

All,
look
we're

Here,
let
me
help

Whaoooo!
Wahhh
hooo!
What?
You
know
you
were
thinking
the
same.
Wonderful
work
Hank,
thank
you
very
much.
And
try
not
to

there's
a
good

I
have

lies

very
beautiful

Erik,
thank
you.
I
didn't

I
still
had
that.
There's
so
much
more
to

than

know.
Not
just
pain,
and
anger.
And
when
you
can

You
will

Do
you
still
want
to
do
this?
Should
we
have
to
hide?
You
already
do.
You're
hiding
right
now.
I
don't
want
to
feel
like
a
freak,
all
the
time.
-
I
just
want
to
look...
Yeah.
Hank,
don't.
You're
beautiful,
Hank.
Look
at
all
of
us.
Look
at
All
we
will
achieve.
We
are
different.
But
we
shouldn't
Society
should
inspire

be
more

Mutant,

It
behooves
me
to
tell
you,
And

are
accepted
into

My

your

Shaw's
declared
war
on
mankind,
He
has
to
be
stopped.
I'm
going
to
kill
him.
Do
you
have
it,
i
need
to
know
that
?

You've
known
that
all
along
But
things
have
changed.
What
started
as
a
covert
mission,
...tomorrow
mankind
will
know
that
mutants
exist.
Shaw,
us...
they
won't
differentiate.
They'll
fear
us,
and
that
Not
if
we
stop
a
war.
Not
if
we
risk
our
lives
doing
so.
Would
they
do
the
same
for
us?
We
have
it
in
us
to
be
the
better
man.
We
already
are.
We're
the
next
stage
of
human
evolution.
-
You
said
it
yourself.
Are
you
really
so
naive?
As
to
think
they
won't
battle
their
own
extinction?
-
Or
is
it
arrogance?
After
tomorrow
they're
going
to
turn
on
us.
And
you're
blind
to
it,
because
you
And
you
believe
they're
all
like,
Shaw.
Listen
to
me,
very
carefully
my
friend.
Killing
Shaw
will
not
bring
you
peace.
Peace
was
never
an
option.



No.
No.


Well...
This
is
a
surprise.
The
nice
kind?
Get
out
Raven,
I
wanna
go
to
bed.
Maybe
in
a
few
years.

How
about
now?
I
prefer
the
real,
Raven.

I
said
the
real,
Raven.

Perfection.
-
Could
you
pass
me
my
robe?
Have
you
ever
looked
at
a
tiger,
No,
but...
You're
an
exquisite
creature,
Raven.
Only
in
life
the
world
tries
to
tame
you.
It's
time
for
you
to
be
free.
You
know
sometimes
I
wonder
If
you
hadn't
found
me
here
that
night.
Sorry
what
?,
For
god's
sake,
Raven!
Where
are
you
clothes?
That's
not
what
you
said
when
you
first
saw
me.
But
I
guess
pets
are
always
cuter
Raven,
I
don't
know
what's
got
into
you
lately.
I
thought
you'd
be
in
a
good
mood.
Hank
tells
me
he's
found
the
You
going
to
tell
me
what's
the
matter?
You
promised
me
you
would
never
do
that.
Until
recently,
I
never
had
to
use
my
powers
You
know
Charles,
I
used
to
think
And
no
matter
how
bad
the
world
gets,
You
want
to
be
a
part
of
it.
ahhh
Gone
to
the
airbase,
bring
the
crate
marked
X.

What
the
hell
happened
here?
Hank
has
been
busy.
Do
we
really
have
to
wear
these?
As
none
of
us
has
mutated
to
enjoy
extreme
G
force,
or
being
riddled
by
bullets,
I
suggest
we
suit
up.
Where's
Hank?
I'm
here.
Hank?
It
didn't
attack
the
cells.
It
didn't
work.
Yes
it
did,
Hank.
Don't
you
see?
This
is
you.
No
more
hiding.
Never
looked
better,
man.
Hank!

Don't
mock
me.
Hank,
put
him
down
immediately,
please.
Hank...HANK!
I
wasn't.
Even
I
got
to
admit,
you
look
pretty
bad
ass.
I
think
I
got
a
new
name
for
you,
Beast.

What?
Arrest

put
him
in

What?
Why?
They
say
the
comrade
lost

The

are

They're
here.
That
telepath
is
powerful.
We're
moving
to

-
That
was

Charles.
But
I
still
can't
locate
Shaw.
He's
down
there,
we
need
to
find
him
now.
Hank?
-
Is
there
anything
unusual
on
the

Well
then
he
must
be
under

Yes
we
do
!.
Yes
we
do.

for

just
need
to
strike

a
location
on

You
ready
for
this?
Let's
find
out.


Remember,
the
point
between
rage
and
serenity.

Hold
on
guys,
it's
going
to
get
bumpy.
Erik,
take
my
hand!





Down.
-
Moira,
Moira,
are
you
all
right?
I
read
the
teleporter's
mind.
Shaw's
drawing
all
of
the
power
out
of
his
sub.
He's
turning
himself
into
some
kind
of
nuclear
bomb.
We've
got
no
time,
the
Geiger
All
right
Moira,
this
is
what
we're
going
to
do.
Get
on
the
radio
and
send
both
fleet's
out
immediately.
I'm
going
in.
Beast,
Havoc,
back
him
up.
Erik,
I
can
guide
you
through
once
you're
in.
But
I
need
you
to
shut
down
Then
we
just
hope
to
god
it's
-
Got
it.
-
Raven,
stop!
We
don't
have
time
for
this.
Anything
comes
in
that
entrance,
Fine.
Beast!
If
we
go,
you
go
We
believe
Shaw
is
trying
to
Erik,
make
for
the
middle
of
the
vessel.
That's
the
point
my
mind
can't
penetrate.
We
have
to
assume
that,
that's
where
Shaw
is.
That's
the
nuclear
reactor.
Stop,
don't
move.

Get
down!


Erik
you're
there,
you've
reached
the
void.
He's
not
here
Charles,
-
He's
left
the
sub.
He
has
to
be,
there's
no
where
And
I'm
telling
you
he's
not,
Erik,
what
a
pleasant
surprise.
Erik?
So
good
to
see
you
again.

May
I
ask
you
something?
Why
are
you
on
their
side?
-
He's
gone.
He's
gone
into
the
void.
I
can't
Why
fight
for
a
doomed
race
...as
soon
as
they
realize

Yeah!
I'm
sorry
for
what
happened
in
the
camps.
I
truly
am.
He's
back.
Erik,
whatever
you're
doing
keep
But
everything
I
did,
To
unlock
your
power.
To
make
you
embrace
it.
It's
working.
I'm
starting
to
see
him,
but
I


You've
come
a
long
way
from
bending
gates.
I'm
so
proud
of
you.
And
you're
just
starting
to
scratch
the
surface.
Think
how
much
further
we
could
go,
together.
Stop,
Azazel!


I
don't
want
to
hurt
you,
Erik.
I
want
to
help
you.
This
is
our
time.
We
are
the
future
of
the
human
race.
You
and
me,
son.
Everything
you
did,
made
me
stronger.
Made
me
the
weapon
I
am
today.
That's
the
truth.
I've
known
it
all
along.
You
are
my
creator.
NOW,
Charles!
Are
you
okay?
Moira
be
quiet,
I
can
only
Sorry,
Charles.
Erik
please,
be
the
better
man.
But
I
dont
trust
you.
Erik,
there
will
be
no
telling
what...
No.
-
Charles?
If
you're
in
there,
I'd
like
you
to
know
We
are
the
future.
But...
...unfortunately,
you
killed
my
mother.
This
is
what
we're
going
to
do.
No,
please
Erik,
no.
I'm
going
to
count
to
three.
One...
Please,
Erik.
Two...
Three.
Aaaaaaaah!

The
Russians
share
our
concerns.
And
will
join
a
strike
on
all
the
mutants.
We
can
end
this
threat
for
good.
We'll
never
have
another
opportunity
like
this.
We
have
an
agent
on
that
beach.
-
One
agent.
She's
collateral
damage.
Today
our
fighting
stops.

Take
off
your
blinders,
brothers
and
sisters.
The
real
enemy
is
out
there.
I
feel
their
guns
moving
in
the
water.
Their
metal
targeting
us.
Americans,
Soviets,
humans.
United
in
their
fear
of
the
unknown.
A
Neanderthal
is
running
scared,
Go
ahead,
Charles.
Tell
me
I'm
wrong.
Fleet
commander
this
is
X-ray
Bravo-70.
Respond,
over.
The
beach
is
secure,
call
off
the
attack.
The
beach
is
targeted
and
ready
to
-
Stand
by.
All
weapons
set.
Hello?
Fire.

Erik,
you
said
yourself,
we're
the
better
men.
This
is
the
time
to
prove
it.
There
are
thousands
of
men
on
those
ships.
Good,
Honest
men.
They're
just
following
orders.
I've
been
at
the
mercy
of
men
Never
again.
Erik,
release
them.
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you,
Stay
back!
Charles,
enough.
Erik,
stop!
Gentlemen,
it's
been
an
honor
serving
with
you.
Comrades,
......


I'm
so
sorry.
I
said
back
off!
You,
you
did
this!
Please...
She
didn't
do
this,
Erik.

Us
turning
on
each
other,
I
tried
to
warn
you,
Charles.
I
want
you
by
my
side.
All
of
us,
together.
Protecting
each
other.
We
want
the
same
thing.
Oh,
my
friend.
I'm
sorry,
but
we
do
not.
Charles,
I'm
sorry,
I'm
so
sorry,
Charles.
It's
all
right,
it's
all
right.
His
society
won't
accept
us.
We
form
our
own.
The
humans
has
played
their
hand.
Now
we
get
ready
to
play
ours.
Who's
with
me?
No
more
hiding.
You,
you
should
go
with
him.
You
promised
me
you
would
never
read
my
mind.
I
know.
I
promised
you
a
great
many
things,
I'm
sorry.
Take
care
of
him.
And
Beast,
never
forget.
Mutant
and
proud.
Help
me
out,
help
him.
I'm
going
to
get
you
to
a
hospital.
-
Wait,
don't,
Charles,
don't
move,
okay.
All
right,
actually
I
ca.....I...I...
I
can't
feel
my
legs
I
can't
feel
my
legs.
I
can't
feel
my
legs.
In
this
week
of
thanksgiving.
As
you
look
back
to
where
we
stood,
The
unity
of
this
hemisphere,
And
the
calm
determination
of
the
American
people.
These
qualities
may
be
tested
many
more
times.
In
this
decade.
So
how
many
students
do
you
think
Once
you
get
the
academy
up
and
running.
As
many
as
I
can
manage,
and
Possibly
more.
You
know,
one
day
the
government
is
going
..to
have
Professor
X
on
their
side.
As
I
suppose
I
am
on
the
First
thing
I'll
be
going
bald.
We're
still
on
the
government
side,
Moira.
We're
still
a
G-man,
just
without
the
G.
No,
you're
your
own
team
now.
It's
better.
You're,
"X-Men".

Guess,
I'll
like
the
sound
of
that.
Moira,
for
us
anonymity
will
be
the
first
line
of
defense.
I
know.
They
can
threaten
me
all
they
want,
Charles.
I'll
never
tell
them
where
you
are.
Ever.
I
know
you
won't.
My
love.
I
remember
the
attack
on
HQ.
Leaving
to
go
somewhere
else.
And
then
this
morning,
I
woke
up
at
home.
That's
it.
All
that
time
wiped
clean
from
your
mind.
Just
gone.
He
can
do
that.
Sometimes
I
get
fragments.
-
A
kiss.
Gentlemen,
this
is
why
the
CIA

What
the
hell
was
that?

I
know
we've
had
our
differences.
-
Where's
your
telepath
friend?
Left
a
bit
of
a
gap
in
my
life.
I
was
rather
hoping
you
would
fill
it.
Join
us.
Erik,
I
believe.
I
prefer...
...Magneto.
