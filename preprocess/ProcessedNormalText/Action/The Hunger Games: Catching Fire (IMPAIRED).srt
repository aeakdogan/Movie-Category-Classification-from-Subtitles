Oh,
whoa.
Easy.

Saw
some
turkeys
on
the
way
here.
Crossed
right
in
front
of
me
-
How
rude
of
them.
You
spend
six
days
a
week
and
stupid
birds
start
to
When's
the
tour
leave?
Couple
hours.
Well,
let's
go.



Hey,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
-
Hey,
whoa.
You're
okay.

You're
okay.
You're
safe.
It's
okay.
You're
here
with
me.
You're
with
me.

Okay,
okay.
I'm
sorry.
Oh,
we...
We
should...
We
should
go.
KATNISS:
Are
you
coming
I
think
you
have
enough
people
Only
a
few
I
actually
care
about.
It
might
be
easier
if
I
didn't.
It's
only
a
few
weeks.
I'll
be
back
before
the
snow
melts.
Yeah,
a
lot
can
happen
Are
we
gonna
do
this
again?
Gale,
it
was
an
act.
Yeah,
it
was
a
good
one.
I
did
what
I
had
to
do
to
survive.
If
I
didn't,
I'd
be
dead.
I
had
to
do
that.
At
least
once.

Haymitch!

Haymitch!
Haymitch,
wake
up.
It's
Tour
Day.
Haymitch.

What
are
you
doing?
Cameras
are
gonna
be
here
in
an
hour.
If
you
wanted
to
be
babied,
PEETA:
Asked
me
what?
HAYMITCH:
Asked
you
to
wake
me
You
are
a
strangely
But
you
do
have
your
virtues.
Would
you
like
some
bread,
Katniss?
No,
I
ate
at
the
Hob,
but
thank
you.
You're
welcome.
Brr.
You
two
have
a
lot
Which
is
in
an
hour,
so
I
just
did.
Did
you
have
a
good
walk,
dear?
-
Walk?
I
was
just
out...
Miss
Everdeen.
This
way,
please.

Such
bravery.
Such
spirit.
Such...
Contempt.
President
Snow.
What
an
honor.
My
dear,
I
think
we
can
make
if
we
agree
not
to
lie
to
each
other.
What
do
you
think?
Yes,
I
think
that
would
save
time.
Sit
down,
please.
I
have
a
problem,
Miss
Everdeen.
A
problem
that
began
those
poison
berries
in
the
arena.
If
that
Head
Gamemaker,
Seneca
Crane,
had
had
any
brains
at
all,
he
would
have
blown
you
But
here
you
are.
I
expect
you
can
guess
where
he
is.
Yes,
I
think
so.
After
that
fiasco,
there
but
to
let
you
play
out
And
you
were
very
good.
That
whole
love-crazed,
Impressive.
Truly.
You
convinced
the
Unfortunately,
not
everyone
I
mean,
you
can't
know
this,
people
viewed
your
little
as
an
act
of
defiance.
Not
as
an
act
of
love.
And
if
a
girl
from
can
defy
The
Capitol
what
is
to
prevent
them
What
is
to
prevent,
say,
an
uprising?
That
can
lead
to
revolution.
And
then,
in
a
fraction
of
time,
the
whole
system
collapses.
It
must
be
a
fragile
system,
if
it
can
be
brought
down
Yes,
it
is,
indeed.
But
not
in
the
way
you
imagine
it.
How
should
I
imagine?
You
should
imagine
thousands
upon
This
town
of
yours
reduced
to
ashes.
Made
radioactive.
Buried
under
dirt
as
if
it
had
never
existed,
You
fought
very
hard
But
they
were
games.
Would
you
like
to
be
in
a
real
war?
No.
Good.
Neither
would
I.
Did
your
mother
make
these?
Peeta.
Oh.
He's
a
lovely
boy.
Tell
me.
At
what
point
did
he
indifference
towards
him?
-
I'm
not
indifferent.
You
promised.
Why
don't
you
just
kill
me
now?
I
don't
want
to
kill
you.
I
want
us
to
be
friends.
But
if
not
friends,
then
allies.
What
do
I
need
to
do?
When
you
and
Peeta
are
on
tour,
you
need
to
smile.
But,
above
all,
you
need
to
be
madly,
prepared-to-end-it-all
in
love.
You
think
you
can
manage
that?
Yes.
Yes,
what?
I'll
convince
them.
No.
Convince
me.
For
you,
Miss
Everdeen.

Do
convince
me.
For
the
sake
of
your
loved
ones.


EFFIE:
Stop.
Take
it
all
in.
This
is
sacred
ground.
History
was
made
here.
Oh.
You'll
get
used
to
the
smell.
-
Hmm.
Hello!

Oh!
There
she
is.
My
greatest
triumph!
FLAVIUS:
Our
little
superstar.

Sweetie,
we've
missed
you.
EFFIE:
What
a
cute
little
house.
So
quaint,
isn't
it?
Of
course,
you've
heard
about
Cinna?
What
happened
to
Cinna?
Oh,
dear,
he's
a
fashion
star.
Everyone
in
The
Capitol's
wearing
him.
-
Everyone.
Oh!
KATNISS:
Cinna!
PRIM:
Katniss?
OCTAVIA:
Katniss,
is
Oh,
sweetie!
Are
you
okay?
OCTAVIA:
Oh,
just
adorable!
-
Yeah.
-
Yeah.

Welcome!

Last
year,
the
74th
Hunger
Games
brought
us
the
greatest
Two
brave
young
people,
chose
to
die
rather
than
As
a
nation,
we
shared
their
agony.
But
we
had
so
little
time

It's
time!
She's
done,
she's
lovely.
All
right
now.
CAESAR:
Let's
go
to
District
12
and
find
our
star-crossed
lovers!
You're
excited.
You're
in
love.
Big
smiles
for
the
camera
CAESAR:
There
she
is!
The
Girl
on
Fire.


And
there
he
is!
Peeta
Mellark!
The
Baker's
Boy.


-
Ooh.
CAESAR:
Uh-oh.
Whoa,
oh.
Trouble
in
paradise.
I
hope
they're
all
right.
Um...
Anyone
at
home?

Should
we
come
back
later?
Sorry,
Caesar.
Oh,
please.
It's
all
right.
It's
your
day.
So
how's
it
going?
We're
good.
That's
it?
That's
all
we
get?
So
taciturn
all
of
a
sudden.

Yeah,
things
are,
uh...
Thanks
to
the
generosity
we've
never
been
closer.
-
25
yards,
to
be
exact.

Fantastic!
We'll
be
checking
in
with
both
of
you
throughout
the
Victory
Tour.
Thank
you
so
much,
Katniss
Everdeen
and
Peeta
Mellark!

-

Everybody
in
motion.
That
was
nice
acting.
You,
too.
Almost
thought
that
kiss
was
real.
EFFIE:
Come
along,
children,
The
train
awaits!
Fabulous
food,
fabulous
wine,
the
massages,
spa
treatments.
nothing
but
the
best
It
all
needs
to
be,
uh...
Fabulous?
Exactly.
Now,
the
schedule
is
a
bit
of
a
bear.
12
days,
12
districts.
But
it's
mostly
adoring
fans
to
greet
you
and
then
we
wrap
it
All
you
need
to
do
is
wave
to
the
crowds,
and
enjoy
your
time
in
the
spotlight.
You've
earned
it.
What
did
you
say?
Katniss.
I
said,
"Enjoy
it,
Katniss,
By
killing
people.
Young
lady...

I'm
really
not
in
the
I'll
apologize
to
Effie
later.
I
thought
you
were
Haymitch.
You
don't
have
to
Including
me.
I
know
it's
not
fair
of
me
to
hold
you
to
things
You
saved
us.
I
know
that.
But
I
can't
go
on
and
then
just
ignoring
So
if
you
can
stop
looking
then
I
can
quit
acting
like
it.
And
then
maybe
we
have
I've
never
been
very
good
at
friends.
For
starters,
it
does
help
I
hardly
know
anything
about
you
except
that
you're
stubborn
That
about
sums
me
up.
No,
there's
more
than
that,
It's
like
I
said,
I'm...
See,
Katniss,
the
way
the
whole
tell
each
other
the
deep
stuff.
-
The
deep
stuff?
Uh-oh.
Like
what?
Like,
uh...
What's
your
favorite
color?
Well,
now
you've

Seriously,
though,
what
is
it?
Green.
What's
yours?
Orange.
Like
Effie's
hair?
No.
More,
uh...
More
like
a

Did
you
see
that?
What?
Whoa.

Well,
I
never.
This
is
not
very
festive.
The
mayor
will
make
And
then
you
just
have
It's
customary,
of
course,
to
the
district's
fallen
Tributes.
For
11,
that's
Thresh
and
Rue.
Here
are
the
speeches.
I
can
do
the
talking
if
you
want.
Thank
you.
MAYOR:
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
Victors
of
the
74th
Hunger
Games.
Katniss
Everdeen
and
Peeta
Mellark!
EFFIE:
Smile,
smile,
smile,
smile.
Stand
up
straight.
You're
on
camera.


Thank
you.
We're
honored
to
be
And
to
be
with
the
families
EFFIE:

He
put
down
the
cards.
-
PEETA:
Though
they
fought...
-
...and
lived
with
honor...
And
dignity
until
the
end,
both
Thresh
and
Rue
were
so
young.
But
our
lives
aren't
They're
measured
in
the
lives
For
myself,
for
Katniss,
we
know
that
without
we
wouldn't
be
standing
here
today.
So
in
recognition
of
that,
knowing
that
it
in
no
way
we'd
like
to
donate
to
the
families
of
the
for
the
rest
of
our
lives.
-


Can
he
do
that?
He
can't.
But
he
did.

Why
doesn't
PEETA:
Thank
you.
I
just
wanted
to
say
that
I
didn't
know
Thresh.
He
could
have
killed
me,
but
instead
he
showed
me
mercy.
That's
a
debt
I'll
never
I
did
know
Rue.
She
wasn't
just
my
ally,
I
see
her
in
the
flowers
I
hear
her
in
a
Mockingjay
song.
I
see
her
in
my
sister
Prim.
She
was
too
young,
too
gentle.

And
I
couldn't
save
her.
I'm
sorry.



KATNISS:
No!
No!
Wait!
Wait!
No!
Leave
him
alone!
No!
Let
me
go!
No!

You!
No,
no,
no!
-
Come
here!
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
Stop!
-
What
did
I
do?
Come
on.
Shut
up.
EFFIE:
In
all
my
years,

You
two
have
a
very
simple
task.
I
never
meant
for
He
has
to
know
that.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Snow.
He
came
to
see
me.
He's
worried
about
rebellion
He
thinks
that
they
don't
HAYMITCH:
So
he
wants
-
To
calm
things
down.
you
shoulda
told
me
and
tried
to
give
these
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
know
what
to
do.
He
threatened
to
kill
my
family.
Well,
I
have
family,
too.
Okay?
People
that
I
need
to
protect.
What
about
them?
Who
protects
them?
Katniss,
what
were
you
thinking?
I
was
thinking
about
Rue.
Haymitch,
please...
Please,
just
help
me
Please,
just
help
us
This
trip?
Girl,
wake
up.
This
trip
doesn't
end
You
never
get
off
this
train.
You
two
are
mentors
now.
That
means
that
every
year,
and
broadcast
the
details
Every
year,
your
private
From
now
on,
your
job
So
people
forget
what
-
So
what
do
we
do?
You're
gonna
read
the
cards
And
you're
gonna
live
Think
you
can
do
that?
Huh?
Yeah?
Come
here.
You're
gonna
be
okay.
I
promise.
PEETA:
Katniss
and
I
want
And
our
gratitude
to
The
Capitol
for
bringing
us
together.
It
was
the
bond
of
love,
forged
in
the
crucible
of
The
Games
that
was
our
greatest
prize.
For
it
is
love
and
true
love
that
allows
us
all
to
That
mends
the
heart
and
banishes
loneliness
and
KATNISS:
We
also
want
to
share
with
The
Tributes
of
this...
The
Tributes
of
this
district
They
brought
honor
to
their
families
and
pride
to
their
people.
We
are
all
of
us
united,
in
serving
a
common
purpose.

Thank
you.
One
day,
I'm
gonna
volunteer.


It
was
just
a
dream.
I'm
sorry.
It's
okay.
I
get
'em,
too.
Goodnight.
Peeta.
Will
you
stay
with
me?
Yeah.
Always.
KATNISS:
We
are
all
of
us
united,
both
victors
and
vanquished,
in
serving
a
common
purpose.
The
power
and
glory
-
of
The
Capitol.
Tell
us
what
you
really
think!
Panem
today.
Panem
tomorrow.

Your
hair
looks
lovely,
darling.
When
did
you
start
Everyone
at
school
wears
it
Snow
is
watching
us.
If
he
wants
you
to
I
promise
you,
he's
not
happy.
Instead
of
being
in
love,
you
two
sound
like
you're
reciting
from
a
drilling
manual.
You
try
reading
that
stuff
Tell
that
to
President
Snow
I'm
open
to
suggestions.
We
could
get
married.
That's
not
helping.
I'm
serious.
If,
like
you
said,
we're
it's
gonna
happen
eventually.
Why
not
now?

It
does
make
a
statement.
Yeah,
sure.
Let's
do
it.
CAESAR:
Just
when
you
thought
going
into
a
very
our
two
lethal
lovers...
-

from
District
12
have
surprised
us
with
a
new
Let's
take
a
look.
-
AUDIENCE:
Aw...
A
fairy
tale
ending
That's
beautiful.
Beautiful.
And
then
tonight,
the
tour
that
began
will
end
where?
The
Presidential
Palace.
The
party
of
the
year.
Eyes
bright.
Chins
up.
Smiles
on.
I'm
talking
to
you,
Katniss.
Now,
there'll
be
photographers.
Everyone
will
be
here
My
Victors.

Breathe
it
all
in,
children.
This
is
all
for
you.
It's
cozy.
Attitude.

Come,
come.

Come
along.
Excuse
us,
excuse
us.
Come,
come.
Hold
hands.
And
the
library.
All
mahogany.
Hello,
hello!
Not
yet,
not
yet.
No,
no,
no.
Ooh,
curtains!
Everybody
who's
anybody
is
here.
And
they
all
want
to
meet
you.
Flavius!
Octavia!

Try
one
of
these.
They
are
divine.
No,
I
can't
eat
another
thing.
-
Here.
FLAVIUS:
It's
for
when
you're
full.
It
makes
you
sick.
So
you
can
go
on
eating.
How
else
could
you
taste
everything?
I
think
it's
time
for
a
dance.
Katniss?

People
are
starving
in
12.
Here,
they're
just
throwing
Katniss?
Peeta.
This
is
Plutarch
Heavensbee.
Successor
to
Seneca
Crane.
That's
a
tough
act
to
follow.
Peeta!

May
I?
Please.
So
how
do
you
like
the
party?
It's
a
little
overwhelming.
It's
appalling.
Still,
if
you
abandon
your
So
are
you
having
fun?
I'm
the
Head
Gamemaker.
Thought
that
was
what
happened
Seneca
decided
to
quit
breathing.
Decided.
It
was
that
or
poison
berries.
Being
Head
Gamemaker
has
never
been
the
most
secure
job
in
the
world.
Then
why
are
you
here?
Same
reason
as
you.
I
volunteered.
Why?
Ambition.
The
chance
to
make
The
Games
The
Games
don't
mean
anything.
They
only
mean
to
scare
us.
Well,
maybe
it
was
you

-

The
Presidential
welcome.
I'm
sure
we'll
meet
again.
Katniss,
come.
The
President
awaits.
You
think
we
convinced
him?
I'm
not
sure
what
else
we
can
do.

Tonight,
on
this,
the
last
day
of
their
tour,
I
want
to
welcome
our
two
Victors.
Two
young
people
who
of
strength
and
valor.
And
I,
personally,
on
the
announcement

Your
love
has
inspired
us.
And
I
know
it
will
go
on
inspiring
us
every
day
for
as
long
as
you
may
live.



SNOW:
Look
at
them.
She's
not
who
they
think
she
is.
She's
not
a
leader.
She
just
wants
to
save
her
own
skin.
I
think
that's
true.
But
she's
become
And
she
has
to
be
eliminated.
I
agree
she
should
die.
At
the
right
time.
It's
moves
and
countermoves.
Katniss
Everdeen
is
a
symbol.
They
think
she's
one
of
them.
We
need
to
show
that
she's
one
of
us.
We
don't
need
to
destroy
her.
Then
we
let
the
people
do
the
rest.
What
do
you
propose?
Shut
down
the
black
markets.
Take
away
what
little
they
have.
Then
double
the
amount
Put
them
on
TV.
Broadcast
them
live.
Sow
fear.
More
fear.
It
won't
work.
Fear
does
not
And
Katniss
Everdeen
She's
engaged.
Make
everything
about
that.
What
kinda
dress
is
she
gonna
wear?
What's
the
cake
gonna
look
like?
Who's
gonna
be
there?
Fear.
Blanket
coverage.
Show
them
that
she
is
one
of
us
now.

They're
gonna
they
might
just

If
we

can
be

Yeah,
who's
"we"?
You,
me
and
your
fiance?
It's
not
just
me
and
Peeta
anymore.
Snow
threatened
to
have
you
killed.
Anyone
else?
Well,
he
didn't

but
a
good
guess,
Unless

You

Unless
nothing

that
I
can

every

There's

The

They
were

It's

It's
finally
happening.
I
should've
just
eaten
and
died
like
I
was
supposed
to.
Then
everything
would
be
back
Safe
for
what?
To
starve?
Work
like
slaves?
Send
their
kids
to
the

You
haven't

You've
given
them

Huh?
The
ones
who
stay.
People
are
looking
to
you,
Katniss.
I
don't
want
anyone
looking
to
me.
I
can't

You

Yeah,

No!
No!
No!
Stop!

It's

Just

It's

Move.
You
want
another?
Go
ahead.

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
No,
you
don't
want
to
shoot
her.
How
about

Easy,

It's

Let
it
go.
And
we
will,
too.
All
right.
Okay.
But
next
time,
it's
the

Excellent
idea.
I
don't
care
who
she
is.
Clear
the

You're
all
under
curfew.
Anyone
out
after
dark
will
be
shot
on

Get
'em
outta

It's

Get

Really

Okay.

Not

MRS.
EVERDEEN:
Make
a

coat.
Peeta,
get
the

What
is
that?
That's
hurting
him.
He
needs

KATNISS:
It's
okay.
Mom.
No.
I'll
do
it.
Oh,
God.

Hold
him,
please.

Hey,
Catnip.
Hey.
Thought
you'd
be
gone
by
now.
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
I'm
gonna
stay
right
here.
Me,
too.
Hey.
You
wanna
get
some
rest?
I
can
look
after
him
for
a
while.
I'm
gonna
go
get
him
more
snow.

Hey.
How's
your
eye?
It's
not
my
eye
that's
bothering
me.
How
can
we
live
like
this?
How
can
anybody
live
like
this?
It's
not
living,
but...
Since
the
last
Games,
I
can
see
it.
What
can
you
see?
Hope.
You
understand
that

you
to

Katniss,
this
is
a
very
big
and
very
emotional
night
for
all
of
us.
Wouldn't
you
say?
Oh,
don't
go
crying
I
can't
make
any
promises.

You
know
I
wouldn't

I
love
her!

But,
Katniss,
on
a
more
serious
note.
I
think
we're
all
here
more
than
a
little
disappointed,
that
a
certain
wedding
Aren't
we,
folks?
AUDIENCE:
Aw...
Alas.
But
am
I
correct
in
assuming
that
this
is
the
gown
on
that
day,
yes
or
no?
Yes,
President
Snow
thought
President
Snow,
as
usual,
was
right.

Was
he
not,
folks?
-

Don't
you
love
it,
folks?
It's
incredible.
It's
so
gorgeous.
Will
you
do
us
the
honor?

Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my!



It's
a
bird.

It's
like
a,
um...
Like
a
Mockingjay.
Your
stylist
certainly
has
hasn't
he?
What
theatricality!
Cinna!
Take
a
bow.

But,
Peeta,
the
wedding,
the
Well,
actually,
we
got
married.
-

CAESAR:
A
secret
wedding?
All
right.
Do
tell.
We...
We
want
our
love
to
be
eternal.
-
Of
course.
PEETA:
You
know,
Katniss
and
I,
we've
been
luckier
than
most.
And
I
wouldn't
have
if
it
weren't...
If...
If
it
weren't
for
what?
What?

If
it
weren't
for
the
baby.

CAESAR:
All
right.

Calm
down.
MAN
1:
Call
off
The
Games!
All
right.

-
Let's,
uh...
Everybody,
calm
down.
It's
a
great
night.
A
great
night.
This
is
news
to
all
of
us.
All
right,
all
right,
all
right.
We're
going
to
find
out


WOMAN:
Cancel
The
Games!
MAN
3:
Stop
The
Games!

There's
no
way
they'll
cancel.
Baby
bomb
was
a
stroke
of
genius.
Unfortunately,
Games
are
still
on.
This
is
goodbye,
for
now.
Presents
for
the
boys.
What
is
this?
Your
token.
Remember?
Hair
for
me.
Pin
for
Katniss.
Gold
bangle
for
you.
And
for
Peeta,
the
medallion
Thank
you,
Effie.
We're
a
team.
Aren't
we?
And
I'm
so
proud
of
my
Victors.
So
proud.
You're
so...
Well,
you
both
deserved
Thank
you,
Effie.
I
am
truly
sorry.

Thank
you,
Haymitch.
For
everything.
Any
last
advice?
Stay
alive.
Haymitch,
wait.

Remember
our
deal.
Do
whatever
it
takes
Promise
me.
Okay.
Katniss,
when
you're
in
the
arena,
remember
who
the
real
enemy
is.
I
don't
want
to
be
with
Just
you.
If
that's
what
you
want.
That's
what
I
want.

I'll
see
you
soon.

MAN:
Your
tracker.

Look
at
this.
They're
holding
hands.
I
want
them
dead.
Be
patient.
They're
holding
hands
now,
but
the
minute
the
gun
goes
off,
And
the
whole
idea
And
the
idea
of
her?
The
idea
of
the
Mockingjay?
The
more
allies
she
betrays,
the
more
friends
she
kills,
the
more
she
reveals
her
true
self.
As
long
as
it
ends
with
and
the
sound
of
cannon.
And
it
shall.
It
better.
Let's
watch
her
get
her
Hmm.
Excuse
me.
Let's
start.

This
suit
is
light.
No
thermal.
So
I'd
guess
tropics
or
desert.
MALE
ANNOUNCER:

That
dress
was
beautiful.
I
think
it
was
the
best
I
thought
you'd
like
it.
I
just
wanted
to
tell
Stop.
Remember,
I'm
still
betting
on
you,

MALE
ANNOUNCER:

-

Cinna!
No!


No!
No!
No!
No!
Cinna!

No!
No!
No!
No!
No,
no...



CLAUDIUS:

May
the
odds
be
ever
in
your
favor.
Peeta?

CLAUDIUS:
Ten,
nine,
eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one.


Good
thing
we're
allies,
right?
Where
did
you
get
that?
Where
do
you
think?
Duck.
-


Don't
trust
1
and
2.
I'll
take
this
side.
I'll
go
find
Peeta.
Katniss,
Mags
found
him.





Katniss,
Katniss,
go,
go,
go.
FINNICK:
Okay,
hold
up.
Hold
up.
Here
you
go.
Okay.
You
all
right
now?
Okay?

God,
it's
hot.
We
gotta
find
fresh
water.

Well,
I
guess
we're
not

You
think
that's
funny?
Every
time
that
cannon
goes
off,
I
don't
care
about
any
of
them.
Good
to
hear.
Want
to
face
the
Career
Pack
alone?
What
would
Haymitch
say?
Haymitch
isn't
here.
Let's
keep
moving.
Peeta,
no!
Peeta?
He's
not
breathing.
He's
not
breathing!
Peeta!


Peeta?
Come
on!
Come
on!
KATNISS:
Please,
wake
up.
No.

Please,
wake
up.
-
Come
on.
Bring
me
in
closer.
Cannon
ready?
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on,
Peeta!
Please,
Peeta.
Peeta.

FINNICK:
Come
on.

Peeta?
Peeta.
Oh,
my
God.
Be
careful.

Oh,
my
God.
You
were
dead.
You
were
dead.
Your
heart
stopped.
It's
okay.
It's
working
now.
You...
Do
you
wanna
stand
up?
Yeah.


It's
okay.
Someday
I
want
to
love
And
so
you
shall,
my
darling.
Hang
on.
The
force
field...
It's
a
dome.
We
couldn't
find
any
FINNICK:
It's
gonna
get
dark
soon.
We'll
be
safe
with
our
backs
protected.
Take
turns
sleeping.
Not
a
chance.
Honey,
that
thing
I
did
That
was
called
"saving
his
life."
If
I
wanted
to
kill
either
of
you,
Why
don't
you
get
some
rest?
Just
for
a
little
bit.
FINNICK:
How's
Peeta?
He's
okay,
I
think.
Just
dehydrated
like
the
rest
of
us.


Eight.
FINNICK:
Mmm-hmm.

KATNISS:
Hey.
"Drink
up"?
FINNICK:
What
is
it?
It's
from
Haymitch.
I
think
it's
a
spile.
A
what?

FINNICK:
You're
kidding
me.
-
Get
some
water.
I'm
gonna
get
a
leaf.
I'll
get
some
for
Mags.
There
we
go.

Want
some
more?


I
counted
12.
Midnight?
Or
the
number
of
districts.

-

FINNICK:
Well...

If
you're
not
gonna
sleep,
I
will.
KATNISS:
Okay.



Run!
Run!
The
fog
is
poison!
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on.

There!





God!
Ah,
God!

Mags,
please,
please!
Peeta.



I
can't
carry
him.
Peeta,
please.
Peeta,
please,
stand
up.
Mags?
-
Mags?
Mags!
-
Mags!
-
Mags!

Finnick,
we
have
to
go.
We
have
to
get
outta
here.
We
have
to
go.
All
right,
come
on,
come
on.
Okay.

-
Shit!






The
water!
The
water
helps.






We
need
our
weapons.
I'm
sorry
about
Mags.
She
was
never
gonna
make
it.
So...
FINNICK:
What?



-
KATNISS:
Peeta.
Walk
over
here
slowly.


Whoa.


Get
to
the
beach.









PEETA:
We
gotta
get
to
the
beach!





KATNISS:
Who
is
that?
A
Morphling!
Help
me
get
her!


Hey,
hey,
hey.
It's
okay.
-
It's
okay.
Shh!
Hey,
you
wanna
see
something?
Look
at
it.
Look
at
that.
It's
incredible,
isn't
it?
All
those
colors.
Don't
worry
about
anything
else.
I'll
be
right
here
with
you.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.


She
sacrificed
herself
for
me
You
think
she
sacrificed
herself?
Looked
like
it.
That
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Look.
For
you.

Thank
you.

That's
new.


Someone's
here.

Johanna?
Johanna!
JOHANNA:
Finnick!

Guess
we
have
more
allies.
JOHANNA:
Well...
I
got
'em
out.
We
were
all
the
way
where
I
thought
it
was
gonna
be
safe.
That's
when
the
rain
started.
I
thought
it
was
water.
It
turned
out
to
be
blood.
-
Tick
tock.
-
It
was
coming
down.
JOHANNA:
It
was
choking
us.
We
were
stumbling
around,
WIRESS:
Tick
tock.
That's
when
Blight
-

He
wasn't
much,
but
he
was
from
home.
Tick
tock.
-
WIRESS:
Tick
tock.
-
She's
in
shock.
Dehydration
isn't
helping.
-
KATNISS:
We
can
get
some.
Tick
tock.
Listen.
Stop
it!
-
Hey!
Lay
off
her!
JOHANNA:
Hey!
What
are
you
doing?
-
Hey,
hey,
hey!
FINNICK:
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
JOHANNA:
Let
me
go,
Finnick!
For
me?
What
does
that
mean?
JOHANNA:
Let
me
go.
-
You
did
want
them
as
allies.
Come
on,
let's
get
you
cleaned
up.
Tick
tock.
-
Tick
tock.
Tick
tock,
okay.
KATNISS:
What
does
Beetee
have
there?
The
coil?
It's
some
kind
of
wire.
Did
he
get
it
from
the
Cornucopia?
Took
a
knife
in
the
back
to
get
it.

-
Tick
tock!
Tick
tock!
I
can't.
Just...
Have
fun
with
"Nuts."


Tick
tock.
It's
a
clock.
My
God,
it's
a
clock!
You're
a
genius!
KATNISS:
This
entire
arena
with
a
new
threat
every
hour,
but
they
stay
only
It
all
starts
with
the
lightning.
Then
the
blood
rain,
fog,
monkeys.
That's
the
first
four
hours.
At
10:00,
that
big
wave
Wiress,
you're
a
genius.
Look,
the
tail
points
to
12.
That's
where
the
lightning
Strikes
where?
That
big
tree.
Good.
"Hickory
dickory
dock.
"The
clock
struck
one,
"Hickory
dickory
dock."

So
12:00
to
1:00,
lightning.
Then
1:00
to
2:00
is
blood.
Then
fog.
And
then
monkeys.
"Hickory
dickory
dock.
"The
clock
struck
3:00..."
KATNISS:
And
then
10:00
What
about
everything
else?
"Hickory
dickory
dock."
-
Nothing
but
blood.
As
long
as
we
steer
clear
of
whichever
FINNICK:
Yeah.
Relatively
speaking.




Change
it
up.
Spin
it.


Come
on!
Come
on!


Hold
on!


No!
Okay.
That's
enough.
Let's
see
how
they
tell
time
now.


You
okay?
JOHANNA:
Let's
just
get
what
we
So
besides
Brutus
and
Maybe
Chaff.
Just
those
three.
They
know
they're
outnumbered.
We're
safe
here
on
the
beach.
So
what
do
we
do?
We
hunt
'em
down?

GIRL:
Katniss,
help
me!
Prim!
-
Prim!
Prim!
FINNICK:
Katniss!
Katniss,
wait!
Prim!
Prim!

Prim!
GIRL:
Katniss!
GIRL:
Help
me!
Help
me!

FINNICK:
Katniss!
You
okay?
WOMAN:
Finnick!
Finnick!
-
No!
It's
not
her.
Annie!
-
Annie!
Annie!
It's
just
a
jabberjay.
It's
not
her.
Well,
how
do
you
think
Jabberjays
copy.
MAN:
Katniss!

Gale.

Come
on,
come
on,
come
on!
(JABBERJAYS
SCREAMING

Peeta!

Stop,
stop,
stop!
It's
okay!

It's
okay!
They're
just
mutts!
-


PEETA:
It's
over.
It's
okay.
The
hour's
gone.

-
Prim!
Find
Prim!
Are
you
okay?
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
I'm
fine.
Okay?
They
won't
touch
Prim.
JOHANNA:
Your
fiance's
right.
If
they
tortured
her
or
forget
the
districts,
there
would
be
riots

Hey,
how
does
What
if
we...
You
know,
you
can't
put
What?
They
can't
hurt
me.
There's
no
one
left
that
I
love.

I'll
get
you
some
water.

Thank
you.
Who's
Annie?
Annie
Cresta.
She
won,
like,
four
years...
Is
she
the
one
that
went
a
little...
Mmm-hmm.
Love
is
weird.
BEETEE:
I
have
a
plan.
JOHANNA:
Finnick!
I
have
a
plan.
Where
do
the
Careers
feel
safest?
The
jungle's
a
nightmare.
Probably
here
on
the
beach.
Then
why
are
they
not
here?
Because
we
are.
We
claimed
it.
And
if
we
left,
they
would
come.
Or
stay
hidden
in
the
tree
line.
Which
in
just
over
four
hours
will
be
soaked
with
water
And
what
happens
at
midnight?
Lightning
strikes
that
tree.
Here's
what
I
propose.
We
leave
the
beach
at
dusk.
That
should
draw
them
Prior
to
midnight
we
then
run
this
Anyone
in
the
water
will
be
electrocuted.
How
do
we
know
Because
I
invented
it.
I
assure
you,
it
won't
burn
up.
Well,
it's
better
than
Yeah,
why
not?
If
it
fails,
no
harm
All
right,
I
say
we
try
it.
So
what
can
we
do
to
help?
Keep
me
alive
for
the
next
six
hours.
That
would
be
extremely
helpful.

I
think
we
need
to
go.
This
plan's
gonna
work.
I
think
so,
too.
And
once
the
Careers
are
dead,
I
don't
want
to
be
the
What
if
they
don't
either?
What
if
all
of
us
We
might
still
end
up
dead.
Maybe
not.
They're
not
gonna
make
You
know
and
I
know
that
there's
And
it's
gonna
be
one
of
us.
The
Careers
are
still
out
there.
We
should
stick
with
these
And
if
we
hear
a
cannon,
we
go.

Katniss,
I
don't...
I
don't
know
what
kinda
deals
but
he
made
me
promises,
too.
If
you
die
and
I
live,
I'd
have
nothing.
Nobody
else
that
I
care
about.
Peeta.
It's
different
for
you.
Your
family
needs
you.
You
have
to
live.
For
them.
What
about
you?
Nobody
needs
me.
I
do.
I
need
you.
JOHANNA:
All
right,
lovebirds!
SNOW:
She
is
preparing
to
fight.
That's
our
girl.
This
is
what
you
predicted.
Moves
and
countermoves.
Indeed.
We'll
toast
when
it's
done?
In
the
meantime,
make


Minimal
charring.
It's
an
impressive
conductor.
Let's
get
started.
Typically
a
lightning
strike
contains
five
billion
We
don't
want
to
be
anywhere
You
two
girls,
go
together
now.
Take
this.
Unspool
it
carefully.
Make
sure
the
entire
coil
is
in
the
water.
Then
head
to
the
tree
We'll
meet
you
there.
I'm
gonna
go
with
them
as
a
guard.
No,
no,
no.
And
the
tree.
No,
I
need
to
go
with
her.
BEETEE:
There
are
two
Careers
out
there.
Finnick
can
protect
you
Why
can't
Finnick
and
and
Peeta
and
I'll
take
the
coil?
You
all
agreed
to
keep
me
It's
his
plan.
We
all
agreed
to
it.
Is
there
a
problem
here?
Excellent
question.
No.
There's
no
problem.
I'll
see
you
at
midnight.
JOHANNA:
All
right,
let's
go!
Come
on.
I
want
to
put
as
much
distance
between
Frying
is
not
how
I
want
to
go.

There's
something...






Stay
down.

Come
on.
FINNICK:
Johanna,
where
are
you?


Johanna?
Peeta.
Peeta.
Oh.
Beetee.
Beetee!
-

Peeta!
Katniss,
where
are
you?
Let
it
fly,
Miss
Everdeen.
Let
it
fly.

Katniss.
Remember
who
the
real
enemy
is.


Katniss,
get
away
from
that
tree!
-



It's
not
possible.
Heavensbee!
Plutarch
Heavensbee!



WOMAN:
Sir,
we've
lost
power.




HAYMITCH:
She's
gonna
lose
it
PLUTARCH:
She'll
still
HAYMITCH:
Without
Peeta?
FINNICK:
Just
tell
her
her
win...
Morning,
sweetheart.

What
are
you
doing
with
them?
You
and
a
syringe
See,
this
is
why
no
one
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
in
here?
Stop.
Stop.
Just
listen.
We
couldn't
tell
you
with
Snow
watching.
Better
for
you
to
know
nothing.

Where's
Peeta?
Now,
Katniss...
You
have
been
our
mission
The
plan
was
always
to
get
you
out.
Half
the
Tributes
were
in
on
it.
This
is
the
revolution.
And
you
are
the
Mockingjay.
And
we're
on
our
way
to
KATNISS:
13?
PLUTARCH:
13.
Where's
Peeta?
He
still
has
his
tracker
in
his
arm.
Johanna
cut
yours
out.
Where
is
he?
In
The
Capitol.
They
got
him
and
Johanna.
You
son
of
a
bitch!
You
son
of
a...
You
promised
me
that
You
promised
me!
You're
a
