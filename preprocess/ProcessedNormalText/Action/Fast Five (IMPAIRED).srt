I'm
taking

O'Conner.
Shitty
call.
You

up
Three

Of
course,
and
sometimes
All
I
care
about
is
the

Tell

is,
BRIAN:
This

Just

Where's
Vince?
That's
a
good

He'll
be
here.
Guys,
we're
all
over
They're
blaming
us
for
the

Which
means
we

The

have

to

everyone
and
they're
going
to
send
their
best

One
thing
we
know
for
sure
is
that
they
wanted
this
car.
Because
something
is
in
it.
If
we

it
is,

Sorry
to

about
Is
all
this
really
necessary
Let
me
tell
you
something
One
is
a
former
federal
officer,
He
knows
every
way
you're
The
other
one
is
a
professional
spent
half
his
life

What's
the
second
thing?
Stay
the
fuck
out
of
my
way.
Brian.
I
have
something
VINCE:
God
damn.
What
a
mess!
Where
you
been,
man?
You
better
check
that
tone.
And
you
just
better
answer
Stop
it!
Where
were
you,
Vince?
Guys
all
over
the
favelas
Couldn't
get
out
of
there
without
Had
to
wait
them
out.
That
is
such
horseshit
That
was
your
job,
Hey!
Enough,
O'Conner!
If
he
said
he
didn't
do
it,
Go
walk
it
off.
REYES:
Look,
I
would
love
to
expand
but,
quite
frankly,
your
business
Let
me
tell
you
a
true
story.
Five
hundred
years
ago,
the
each
trying
to
get
the
country
The
Spaniards
arrived,
guns
blazing,
The
natives
killed
Personally,
I
prefer
They
came
bearing
gifts.
Mirrors,
scissors,
trinkets.
Things
that
the
natives
but
to
continue
receiving
them,
they
And
that's
why
all
Brazilians
Now,
if
you
dominate
they
will
eventually
fight
back
And
that's
the
key.
I
go
into
the
favelas
and
Electricity,
running
water,
school
rooms
for
their
kids.
And
for
that
taste
I
own
them.
Gentlemen.

I
apologize
for
Senior
Reyes,
We've
found
them.
Pardon
me,
gentlemen.
DOM:
Almost
wish
Almost.
Wait,
Dom.
Mia
was
on
that
train.
My
sister!
I
didn't
know.
You
set
up
the
deal!
I
thought
the
job
I
didn't
know.
All
they
want
is
the
chip.
Damn!
You
should've
come
clean.
What's
going
on
out
here?
Nothing.
Please,
Dom,
just
let
me
have
the
chip.
They'll
give
it
to
Reyes
Get
out.
What?
Get
out!
You
never
listen
to
me.
Not
when
I
told
you
You
never
trust
me
Look
at
our
family
now.
I
can't
go
home!
Where's
Letty,
Dom?
Where's
Letty?

Wilkes,
I
want
a

that
distributes
Pass
me
that

You
asked
for
me?
May
I
ask
why?
My
smile
Your

was
an

Six

later,
you
upped
You're

we'll
You
come

I'm
motivated.
HOBBS:
All
right,
then.
Let's
find
ourselves
a
car.
What
do
you
think?
Well,
it's
definitely
Look
at
all
these
side
menus
Let's
check
this
one.
Look
at
that.
Same
building,
It's
a

What's
this?
Drugs?
No.
That's
a
dealer
pack.
See,
most
major

so
they
don't
have
Right
there,
49
kilos
is
a
million
You're
saying
each
one
of
these
Yeah.
I
thought
so.
So
what
is
that?
A
100-million
plus
That's
how
he
keeps
it
I
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
It's
his
whole
network
right
Wilkes,
Fusco,
Mac,
Chato,
What
about
me?
Stay
here.

Go
that
way!
The

They're
going
to
be
looking
for

got.
We
have
no
choice
I'm
pregnant.
I

not
going
through
Are
you
kidding
me?
I'm
not
going
Dom?
Promise
me
I
promise.
Our
family
Something
Toretto
and
O'Conner.
They
stay
when
they're
supposed
to
run,
Now
they're
killing
It
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Here's
what
makes
sense.
All
these
guys
are
They
come
up,
Not
a
phone
call
more,
Wilkes,
we
get
anything?
Standard
forensics.
Shoe
prints.
Prints
are
all
over
the
car.
Anything
else?
Yeah,
we
tracked
the
owner
There
are
a
couple
of
shell
but
we
finally
traced
it
owned
by
an
investor
down
Investor?
If
theres
anything
illegal
happening
Okay,
then
so
are
we.
If
he
could
get
us
any
closer
to

If
he

john,
I
want
to
You

it,
boss.
Let's
put
all
this
That's
going
to
take
a
while.
Then
you
better
get
started.
They
were
taking
Let's
put
it
back
together
Hey,
Dom,
what
do
you
My
father.
He
used
to...
He
used
to
have
a
barbecue
For
anybody
If
you
didn't
go
to
church,
Every
single
day
he
was
in
the
he
was
at
the
kitchen
table
with
Mia,
Even
after
she
went
to
sleep,
he'd
stay
up
so
he
could
learn
the
next
chapter
I
remember
everything
Everything.
That's
just
it.
I
don't
remember
shit
I
don't
remember
I
don't
remember
To
be
honest
with
you,
I
don't
even
I
don't
remember.
He
was
just
never
there.
You
ain't
going
We
can't
keep
We
got
to
get
out.
We
got
to
get
out
now.
You're
right.
Here's
how
we're
We're
going
to
use
this.
We're
going
do
one
last
job.
We're
going
to
take
Every
dime
of
it,
and
disappear.
Forever.
New
passports.
New
lives
with
no
more
And
we're
just
going
That's
right.
You
realize
we're
talking
the
most
powerful
guy
Yes,
we
are.
Then
we're
going
Let's
run
through
the
bases
real
quick.
First
we're
going
Someone
who
can
What
else?
A
fast
talker.
Someone
who
can
bullshit
I
got
that.
This
guy
is
going
to
have
We're
going
to
need
someone
DOM:
And
with
those
circuits,
We're
going
to
need
guys
MIA:
What
else?
Utilities
and
weapons.
Someone
who
ain't
Someone
to
back
up
BRIAN:
Yeah,
what
else
DOM:
Most
importantly,
we're
going
to
need
Guys
that
don't
crack
Guys
that
never
lose.
You
know
we
got
that.
Aw,
hell,
no!
I
see
they
really
scraped
I
guess
they
did,
When
are
you
going
to
give
As
soon
as
you
give
What's
up,
man?
Hmm.
Sexy
legs,
What
time
do
they
open?
They
open
the
same
time
Want
me
to
open
them?

I
told
you
the

shit
What's
this
guy
saying?
Ugly
is
still
ugly
in

Who
are
these
clowns,
man?
I
thought
cockfights
I
see
you
all
have
met.
You
know
when
you
called
me
I
assumed
it
would
be
for
something
Look
at
this
guy.
Long
time.
Good
to
see
you.
Brother.
Yo,
check
this
out.
Best
circuit
man
And
this
is
my
boy,
We
go
way
back,
I
pulled
that
job
I've
heard
about
you.
Nice
digs.
Yeah,
well,
So
what's
this
Yeah,
man,
why
did
you
drag
Because
we
got
a
job.
All
right,
so
our
target's
And
he
runs
He's
never
been
busted
because
No
paper
trail
And
no
banks
means
That's
right.
Spread
throughout
the
city.
And
we're
going
All
of
them?
All
of
them.
That
sounds
crazy.
You
bring
us
so
we
can
rob
I
thought
this
was
business.
Sounds
personal
to
me.
Is
that
what
this
is?
I
got
love
for
y'all,
but
I
can't
do
this,
homie.
So
what
we're
talking
You
say
what?
Hundred...
See,
sometimes
and
I
know
we
just
met,
but
That's
right,
$100
million,
we
split
even.
TEJ:
That's
a
little
over
I
am
down.
I'm
in.
Eleven
million.
Sounds
like
a
whole
lot
of
You
can't
pull
off
10
heists
You
just
can't.
As
soon
as
we
hit

everything
Exactly.

Nobody

That's
all
of
it.

All
right,
then
whatever
was
on
that

It's

know
that?
Because
no
one

They
invaded
Who
invaded?
The
men
from

How
much
did
they
take?
They
didn't
They
burned

They
burned
my

Yes.
And
