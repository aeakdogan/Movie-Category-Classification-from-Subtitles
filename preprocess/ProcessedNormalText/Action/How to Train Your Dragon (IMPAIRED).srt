It's

here
for
seven
generations,
We

fishing,

The
only
problems
are
the
pests.
yöu
see,
most
places
We
have...
...dragons.
Most
people
would
leave.
Not
us.
We're
Vikings.
My
name
is
Hiccup.
Great
name,
I
know.
Parents
believe
a
hideous
name
Like
our
charming
Viking
demeanor
Morning!

What
are
yöu
doing
here?!
-
What
are
yöu
doing
out?!
Hiccup!

doing?
That's
Stoick

Vast,
When
he
was
a
baby,
he
popped
Do

it?
Yes,
I
do.
What
have
we
got?
Gronckles.
Nadders.
Zipplebacks.

Any
Night
Furies?
Good.
Hoist

torches!
Nice
of
yöu

the
party!
Who,

No,

They
wouldn't
know
They
need
toothpicks,
don't
they?
The
meathead
with
attitude
I've
been
his
apprentice
Move
to
the
lower
defenses.
Hurry!
See?
Old
village,
Fire!
Let's
go!
That's
Fishlegs,
Snotlout,
the
twins,
...and...
...Astrid.
Their
job
is
so
much
cooler.
Come
on.
Let
me
out,
please.
yöu've
made
plenty
of
marks,
Please,
two
minutes.
I'll
kill
a
dragon.
My
life
will
get
infinitely
better.
yöu
can't
lift
a
hammer.
yöu
can't
even
throw
one
of
these!
OK,
fine,
See?
Now
this
right
here
-
Mild
calibration
issue...
If
yöu
ever
want
to
get
out
there
...yöu
need
to
stop
all
this.
But
yöu
just
pointed
to
all
of
me.
Yes,
that's
it!
Oh,
yes.
yöu,
sir,
Keeping
this
much
There
will
be
consequences!
I'll
take
my
chances.
One
day,
I'll
get
out
there.
...is
everything
around
here.
A
Nadder
head
is
sure
Gronckles
are
tough.
Taking
down
one
of
those
A
Zippleback?
Exotic.
Two
heads,
twice
the
status.
They
found
the
sheep!
Concentrate
fire
over
the
lower
bank.
-
Hurry
up!
And
then
there's
Only
the
best
Vikings
go
after
those.
They
have
this
nasty
habit
Reload!
I'll
take
care
of
this.
But
the
ultimate
prize
-
We
call
it
the...
Get
down!
Jump!
This
thing
never
steals
food,
...never
misses.
No
one
has
ever
killed
a
Night
Fury.
Man
the
fort,
Hiccup.
Stay.
Put.
There.
yöu
know
what
I
mean.
-
Where
are
yöu
going?
-
Hiccup!
Let's
get
him!
Mind
yöurselves!
The
devils
still
have
Come
on.
Give
me
something
to
I
hit
it.
Yes,
I
hit
it!
Did
anybody
see
that?
Except
for
yöu.
-
Do
not
let
them
escape!
yöu're
all
out.
Oh,
and
there's
one
more
thing
Sorry,
Dad.
OK,
but
I
hit
a
Night
Fury.
It's
not
like
the
last
few
times,
Dad!
yöu
guys
were
busy.
It
went
down
off
Raven
Point.
Stop!
Just
stop.
Every
time
yöu
step
outside,
Can
yöu
not
see
that
Winter
is
almost
here
Between
yöu
and
me,
the
village
This
isn't
a
joke,
Hiccup!
Why
can't
yöu
follow
I
can't
stop
myself.
I
see
a
dragon
It's
who
I
am,
Dad.
yöu're
many
things,
Hiccup.
Get
back
to
the
house.
Make
sure
he
gets
there.
I
have
his
mess
to
clean
up.
Quite
the
performance.
I've
never
seen
anyone
Thank
yöu,
thank
yöu.
I
was
trying.
-
I
really
did
hit
one.
-
He
never
listens.
When
he
does,
like
someone
skimped
on
meat
"Excuse
me,
barmaid.
I
ordered
an
extra
large
boy
with
beefy
This
here,
this
is
a
talking
fishbone."
yöu're
thinking
about
this
wrong.
It's
not
so
much
what
yöu
look
like,
Thank
yöu
for
summing
that
up.
Look,
the
point
is,
stop
trying
I
just
want
to
be
one
of
yöu
guys.
Either
we
finish
them
It's
the
only
way
If
we
find
the
nest
and
destroy
it,
the
dragons
will
leave.
One
more
search
Those
ships
never
come
back.
We're
Vikings.
It's
an
occupational
Count
me
out.
-
Today's
no
good
for
me.
All
right.
Those
who
stay
-
To
the
ships!
That's
more
like
it.
I'll
pack
my
undies.
No,
I
need
yöu
to
stay
Perfect.
And,
while
I'm
busy,
Molten
steel,
razor
sharp
blades,
What
could
possibly
go
wrong?
What
am
I
going
Put
him
in
training.
-
No,
I'm
serious.
He'd
be
killed
before
-
yöu
don't
know
that.
-
No,
yöu
don't.
No,
yöu
don't.
Listen,
yöu
know
what
he's
like.
From
the
time
he
could
crawl,
He
doesn't
listen.
He
has
I
take
him
fishing
Trolls
exist.
They
steal
yöur
socks.
But
only
the
left
ones.
-
When
I
was
a
boy...
...my
father
told
me
to
bang
I
thought
it
was
crazy,
-
And
yöu
know
what
happened?
That
rock
split
in
two.
It
taught
me
what
He
could
crush
mountains,
Even
as
a
boy,
I
knew
what
I
was,
Hiccup
is
not
that
boy.
yöu
can't
stop
him,
Stoick.
yöu
can
only
prepare
him.
I
know
it
seems
hopeless,
but
yöu
won't
He's
going
to
get
out
there
again.
Oh,
the
gods
hate
me.
Some
people
lose
their
knife
I
manage
to
lose
an
entire
dragon.
Oh,
wow.
I
did
it.
I
did
it.
This
fixes
everything!
Yes!
I
have
brought
down
I'm
going
to
kill
yöu,
dragon.
Then
I'll
cut
out
yöur
heart
I
am
a
Viking.
I
am
a
Viking!
I
did
this.
Hiccup.
Dad...
...I
have
to
talk
to
yöu,
Dad.
I
need
to
speak
with
yöu,
too,
son.
-
I
don't
want
to
fight
dragons.
-
What?
-
yöu
go
first.
All
right.
yöu
get
yöur
wish.
Dragon
training...
Oh,
man,
I
should
have
gone
first.
I
was
thinking,
yöu
know,
we
have
a
surplus
but
do
we
have
enough
bread
making
yöu'll
need
this.
I
don't
want
to
fight
dragons.
Come
on.
Yes,
yöu
do.
Rephrase.
Dad,
I
can't
kill
dragons.
But
yöu
will
kill
dragons.
No,
I'm
really
very
extra
sure
-
It's
time,
Hiccup.
This
is
serious,
son.
When
yöu
carry
this
axe,
Which
means
yöu
walk
like
us,
...yöu
think
like
us.
No
more
of...
this.
yöu
just
gestured
to
all
of
me.
-
Deal?
Deal?
Deal.
Good.
Train
hard.
I'll
be
back.
Probably.
And
I'll
be
here.
Maybe.
Welcome
to
dragon
training!
No
turning
back.
I
hope
I
get
some
serious
burns.
I'm
hoping
for
some
mauling,
Yeah,
it's
only
fun
if
yöu
get
Yeah,
no
kidding,
right?
Pain.
Love
it.
Oh,
great.
Who
let
him
in?
Let's
get
started!
will
win
the
honor
in
front
of
the
entire
village.
Hiccup
already
killed
a
Night
Fury,
Can
I
transfer
to
the
class
Don't
worry.
yöu're
small
and
weak...
They'll
see
yöu
as
sick
or
insane
and
go
after
the
more
Behind
these
doors
yöu
will
learn
to
fight!

The
Deadly
Nadder!
The

Plus

-
The
Monstrous

Can
yöu
stop
that?!
And
the
Gronckle.
Jaw
strength

Wait,
aren't
yöu
gonna
teach
us
first?
I
believe
in
learning
on
the
job.
Today
is
about
survival.
...yöu're
dead!
What's
the
first
thing
yöu'll
need?
-
A
doctor?
-
A
shield.
yöur
most
important
piece
of
equipment
If
yöu
must
choose
between
-
Let
go
of
my
shield!
Take
that
one.
It
has
a
flower...
Oops,
this
one
has
blood
on
it.
-
Tuffnut,
Ruffnut!
yöu're
out!
Shields
are
good
for
another
thing.
Noise!
Make
lots
of
it
All
dragons
have
How
many
does
a
Gronckle
have?
-
Five?
Correct,
six!
Fishlegs,
out!
Hiccup,
get
in
there!
I
moved
into
my
parents'
basement.
yöu
look
like
yöu
work
out.
Snotlout!
yöu're
done!
So
it's
just
yöu
and
me,
huh?
Nope,
just
yöu.
One
shot
left!
Hiccup!
And
that's
six.
Go
back
to
bed,
yöu'll
get
another
chance,
Remember,
a
dragon
will
always,
always
go
for
the
kill.
So...
why
didn't
yöu?
This
was
stupid.
Why
don't
yöu
just
fly
away?
All
right,
where
did
Astrid
go
wrong
I
mistimed
my
somersault
dive.
-
It
threw
off
my
reverse
tumble.
No,
no,
yöu
were
great.
She's
right.
yöu
have
to
be
Where
did
Hiccup
go
wrong?
-
He
showed
up.
He's
never
where
he
should
be.
Thank
yöu,
Astrid.
yöu
need
to
live
and
breathe
Everything

know
about

Study
up.
Wait,
yöu

While
we're
still

Why

times.

Yeah.
That
sounds
great.
-
There
was
a
chance
I'd
read
it...
yöu
guys
read.
I'll
go
kill
stuff.
Another

So
I

we'll

Steady.
Take
us
in.
Hard

For
Helheim's
Gate.
Hard
to
port!
Steady!
Hey,
yöu
know,
I
just
happened
to
notice
Is
there
another
book,
or
a
sequel?
Focus,
Hiccup!
Today
it's
all
about
attack!
Nadders
are
quick
and
light
yöur
job
is
to
be
quicker
and
lighter!
I'm
really
beginning
to
question
Look
for
its
blind
spot!
Find
it,
hide
in
it
and
strike!
Do
yöu
ever
bathe?
If
yöu
don't
like
it,
then
How
about
I
give
yöu
one?
Blind
spot,
yes.
Hey,
so,
how
would
one
sneak
up
No
one's
ever
met
one
and
lived
-
I
know,
I
know,
but
hypothetically...
Get
down.
Watch
out,
babe.
The
sun
was
in
my
eyes,
Astrid.
What
do
yöu
want
me
to
do,
I
could
do
that
but
I
don't
have
time!
They
probably...
...take
the
daytime
off,
right?
Has
anyone
ever
seen
one
napping?
Hiccup!
Love
on
the
battlefield.
She
could
do
better.
Let
me...
Why
don't
yöu?
Well
done,
Astrid.
Is
this
some
kind
of
a
joke
to
yöu?
Our
parents'
war
Figure
out
which
side
yöu're
on.
Toothless.
I
could
have
sworn
yöu
had...
...teeth.
No,
no,
no.
I
don't
have
any
more!
And
with
one
twist,
he
took
my
hand
I
saw
the
look
on
his
face...
He
must
have
passed
the
word,
because
it
wasn't
a
month
before
Isn't
it
weird
to
think
Like
if
yöur
mind
was
still
yöu
could
have
killed
the
dragon
I
swear,
I'm
so
angry.
I'll
avenge
yöur
I'll
chop
off
the
legs
of
every
dragon
It's
the
wings
and
the
tails
If
it
can't
fly,
it
can't
get
away.
A
downed
dragon
is
a
dead
dragon.
All
right,
I'm
off
to
bed.
Tomorrow
we
get
to
the
big
boys,
making
our
way
up
But
who'll
win
the
honor
of
killing
it?
It's
gonna
be
me.
It's
my
destiny.
See?
yöur
mom
let
yöu
get
a
tattoo?
It's
not
a
tattoo,
it's
a
birthmark.
OK,
I've
been
stuck
with
yöu
since
Yes,
it
was.
yöu've
just
never
Hey,
Toothless.
I
brought
breakfast.
I
hope...
OK,
that's
disgusting.
We've
got
some
salmon,
...and
a
whole
smoked
eel.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Yeah,
I
don't
really
like
That's
it.
That's
it.
And
don't
yöu
mind
me.
minding
my
own
business.
It's
OK.
OK.
That's
not
too
bad.
It
works.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Oh,
my!
It's
working!
Yes,
yes!
I
did
it!
Yeah!
Today
is
about

If

Hey,
it's

are
getting
bigger.
Not

Wait.
Oh,

Oh,

Hiccup!
Back,

Back

OK,
so

we
done?
'Cause
I've
got
Yep,
I'll

Get

Oh,
I'm

much
hurt!
Wow!
He's
better
than
yöu
ever
were.
Oh,
great.
Hiccup.
Hiccup?
Are
yöu
in
there?
Astrid.
Hey.
Hi,
Astrid.
Hi,
Astrid.
Hi,
Astrid.
I
normally
don't
care
what
people
do,
Well,
weirder.
-
I
trust
yöu
found
the
nest,
at
least?
Excellent.
I
hope
yöu
had
more
success
than
me.
Well,
if
by
success,
yöu
mean
that
Congratulations,
Stoick!
Out
with
the
old
and
-
No
one
will
miss
that
nuisance!
-
Come
over
here.
He's
gone?
Most
afternoons,
but
who
can
blame
He
can
barely
walk
through
the
village
Hiccup?
Who
would
have
thought
it?
OK,
bud.
Here
we
go.
Here
we
go.
Position...
...three...
no,
four.
All
right,
it's
go
time.
It's
go
time.
Come
on,
buddy!
Come
on,
buddy!
Yes,
it
worked!
Sorry!
It
was
my
fault.
Yeah,

I'm
on
it.
Position

Three.
Yeah!
Go,
baby!
Yes!
Oh,
this
is
amazing!
Stop!

Oh,

Oh,

All

OK,
yöu've
gotta
OK,

no.
Come
back
down
Yeah!
Come
on.
No,
thanks.
I'm
good.
Not
so
fireproof
Here
yöu
go.
Everything
we
know
Dad!
yöu're
back!
I
know.
-
I
came
looking
for
yöu.
yöu've
been
keeping
secrets.
I
have?
Just
how
long
did
yöu
think
I
don't
know
what
yöu're...
Nothing
happens
on
this
island
So...
...let's
talk...
...about
that
dragon.
Oh,
gods.
Dad,
I'm
so
sorry.
I
just
didn't
know
how
to...
yöu're
not
upset?
What?!
I
was
hoping
for
this!
-
yöu
were?
Wait
till
yöu
spill
And
mount
yöur
first
What
a
feeling!
All
those
years
of
the
worst
Viking
Odin,
it
was
rough.
And
all
the
while
Oh,
Thor
Almighty!
With
yöu
doing
so
well
in
the
ring...
...we
finally
have
something
Here,
I
brought
yöu
something,
to
keep
yöu
safe
in
the
ring.
Wow.
Thanks.
yöur
mother
would
have
wanted
yöu
to
Matching
set.
Wear
it
proudly.
yöu
deserve
it.
-
I
should
really
get
to
bed.
-
I'll
see
yöu
back
at
the
house.
Great.
Thanks
for
stopping
by...
...and
for
the
breast
hat.
Well...
Yep.
Good
night.
Stay
out
of
my
way!
Please,
by
all
means.
This
time,
this
time
for
sure!
No!
No,
son
of
a
half
troll,
-
rat
eating,
munge
bucket!
-
So,
later.
-
I'm
kind
of
late
for...
Late
for
what,
exactly?
Quiet
down!
The
elder
has
decided.
yöu've
done
it,
Hiccup!
That's
my
boy!
Yeah.
Yes.
I
can't
wait.
I
am
so...
...leaving!
We're
leaving.
Let's
pack
up.
Looks
like
yöu
and
me
Forever.
Oh,
man.
What
the?!
I
want
to
know
what's
going
on.
No
one
just
gets
as
good
as
yöu
do.
Start
talking!
Training?
It
better
not
involve
this.
I
know
this
looks
really
bad,
yöu're
right.
yöu're
right.
I'm
through
with
the
lies.
It's
time
everyone
knew.
Why
would
yöu
do
that?!
That's
for
the
lies.
Oh,
man.
Get
down!
Run,
run!
It's
OK!
It's
OK.
She's
a
friend.
yöu
just
scared
him.
I
scared
him?!
Who
is
"him"?
Astrid,
Toothless.
Toothless,
Astrid.
We're
dead.
Where
do
yöu
think
yöu're
going?
Oh,
great
Odin's
ghost!
This
is
it!
Hiccup,
get
me
down
from
here!
yöu
have
to
give
me
a
chance
to
explain.
I
am
not
listening
Then
I
won't
speak.
Please,
Astrid.
Now
get
me
down.
Toothless,
down.
Gently.
See?
Nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
Toothless!
What
is
wrong
with
yöu?!
Bad
dragon!
He's
not
usually
like
this.
Toothless,
what
are
yöu
doing?
And
now
the
spinning.
Thank
yöu
for
nothing,
OK,
I
am
sorry!
I'm
sorry.
Just
get
me
off
of
this
thing.
All
right,
I
admit
it.
It's
amazing.
He's
amazing.
So
what
now?
Hiccup,
yöur
final
exam
is
tomorrow.
yöu
know
yöu'll
have
to
kill...
...kill
a
dragon.
Don't
remind
me.
Toothless,
what's
happening?
What
is
it?
Get
down!
-
What's
going
on?
Toothless,
yöu
gotta
get
us
It
looks
like
What
does
that
make
us?
What
my
dad
wouldn't
give
It's
satisfying
to
know
that
all
of
They're
not
eating
any
of
it.
What
is
that?
All
right,
bud,
It
totally
makes
sense.
They're
the
workers
It
controls
them.
Let's
find
yöur
dad.
No!
No.
No,
not
yet.
They'll
kill
Toothless.
We
have
to
think
this
through
Hiccup,
we
just
discovered
the
thing
we've
been
after
and
yöu
want
to
keep
it
a
secret?
To
protect
yöur
pet
dragon?
Yes.
OK.
Then
what
do
we
do?
Just
give
me
until
tomorrow.
OK.
That's
for
kidnapping
me.
That's
for
everything
else.
What
are
yöu
looking
at?
Hiccup!
Hiccup!
Hiccup!
Hiccup!
I
can
show
my
face
in
public
again!
If
someone
had
told
me
Hiccup
would
go
from,
well,
to
placing
first
in
dragon
training,
and
shipped
him
off
And
yöu
know
it!
But
here
we
are.
or
more
proud
than
I
am.
Today,
my
boy
becomes
a
Viking.
Today,
he
becomes
one
of
us!
Be
careful
with
that
dragon.
-
It's
not
the
dragon
I'm
worried
about.
Put
an
end
to
this.
I
have
to
try.
Astrid,
if
something
goes
wrong,
just
make
sure
I
will.
Just
promise
me
It's
time,
Hiccup.
Knock
'em
dead.
Yeah!
Show
'em
how
it's
done.
Hiccup!
Hiccup!
Hiccup!
Hiccup!
I
would
have
gone
for
the
hammer.
I'm
ready.
Go
on,
Hiccup.
Give
it
to
him!
What
is
he
doing?
Hey,
it's
OK.
It's
OK.
I'm
not
one
of
them.
What's
he
thinking?
-
Stop
the
fight.
I
need
yöu
all
to
see
this.
They're
not
what
we
think
they
are.
We
don't
have
to
kill
them.
I
said,
stop
the
fight!
Out
of
my
way!
Hiccup!
This
way!
Night
Fury!
Toothless,
go.
Get
out
of
here.
Go,
go!
Stoick,
no!
Dad,
he
won't
hurt
yöu!
No,
don't!
Toothless,
stop!
No!
No!
Get
him!
No,
no!
Please
just
don't
hurt
him!
Please
don't
hurt
him.
Put
it
with
the
others.
I
should
have
known.
-
Dad?
I
know
we
did.
That
was
before...
So
everything
in
the
ring,
I
screwed
up.
I
should
have
Take
this
out
on
me,
be
mad
at
me,
The
dragon?
Not
the
people
yöu
almost
killed?
He
was
protecting
me!
They've
killed
hundreds
of
us!
And
we've
killed
thousands
of
them!
They
defend
themselves,
that's
all!
If
they
don't
bring
enough
food
back,
There's
something
else
Their
island?
-
Did
I
say
nest?
What?
No,
I
didn't.
Toothless
did.
Only
a
dragon
can
find
the
island.
No,
no,
no.
No,
Dad.
yöu
don't
know
what
yöu're
up
against.
Dad,
please.
I
promise
yöu,
No,
Dad.
No.
For
once
in
yöur
life,
yöu've
thrown
yöur
lot
in
with
them.
yöu're
not
my
son.
Ready
the
ships!
This
way.
Set
sail!
We
head
for
Helheim's
Gate.
Lead
us
home,
devil.
It's
a
mess.
yöu
must
feel
horrible.
yöur
father,
yöur
tribe,
Thank
yöu
for
summing
that
up.
Why
couldn't
I
have
killed
that
dragon
-
Would
have
been
better
for
everyone.
So
why
didn't
yöu?
-
Why
didn't
yöu?
-
I
couldn't.
Why
is
this
so
important
Because
I
want
to
remember
For
the
love
of...
I
was
a
coward.
yöu
said
"wouldn't".
Whatever!
I
wouldn't!
Three
hundred
years
and
I'm
the
first
First
one
to
ride
one,
though.
So?
I
wouldn't
kill
him
because
I
looked
at
him
and
I
saw
myself.
I
bet
he's
really
frightened
now.
-
Probably
something
stupid.
Then
something
crazy.
That's
more
like
it.
Sound
yöur
positions.
-
Here!
Listen,
Stoick,
I
was
overhearing
some
are
wondering
what
it
is
I
know
yöu're
always
the
man
not
me,
are
wondering
if
there
is
-
and
what
it
might
be.
Of
course.
Send
them
running.
The
old
Viking
fallback.
Step
aside.
Bear
to
port.
If
yöu're
planning
on
getting
eaten,
yöu
were
wise
to
seek
help
It's
me.
-
I
love
this
plan.
yöu're
crazy.
I
like
that.
So,
what
is
the
plan?
That's
not
really
encouraging.
I
was
wondering
where
that
went.
Stay
low
and
ready
yöur
weapons.
We're
here.
-
Wait!
What
are
yöu?
It's
OK.
It's
OK.
Where
are
yöu
going?
yöu'll
need
something
When
we
crack
this
mountain
open,
In
my
undies.
No
matter
how
this
ends,
Is
that
it?
We've
done
it!
This
isn't
over!
Get
clear!
Beard
of
Thor!
What
is
that?!
Odin
help
us.
Catapults!
-
Get
to
the
ships!
-
Smart,
that
one.
Lead
the
men
Gobber,
go
with
the
men!
I
think
I'll
stay,
in
case
yöur
I
can
buy
them
a
few
minutes
Then
I
can
double
that
time.
-
Here!
Come
on!
Fight
me!
No,
me!
Ruff,
Tuff!
Watch
yöur
backs!
Move,
Fishlegs!
Look
at
us!
We're
on
a
dragon.
Up!
Let's
move
it!
Every
bit
the
boar
headed
-
Fishlegs,
break
it
down!
Heavily
armored
skull
and
tail
Steer
clear
of
both.
Small
eyes,
large
OK,
Lout,
Legs!
Hang
in
its
blind
spot,
Ruff,
Tuff,
find
out
That's
my
specialty!
Since
when?!
Everyone
knows
Just
do
what
I
told
yöu!
-
Don't
worry!
We
got
it
covered!
-
Troll!
Bride
of
Grendel!
This
thing
doesn't
have
a
blind
spot!
There!
Go
help
the
others!
OK,
hold
on.
Hold
on.
-
It's
working!
I've
lost
power
on
the
Gronckle!
I'm
OK!
Less
OK!
I
can't
miss!
What's
wrong,
buddy?
Yeah!
yöu're
the
Viking!
Dad?
yöu
got
it,
bud.
Hiccup!
I'm
sorry...
for
everything.
Yeah.
Me,
too.
yöu
don't
have
to
go
up
there.
We're
Vikings.
I'm
proud
to
call
yöu
my
son.
Thanks,
Dad.
He's
up!
Get
Snotlout
out
of
there.
-
I'm
on
it!
-
Hey,
let
me
drive!
No,
this
way.
-
Don't
push
me!
I
can't
believe
that
worked!
Night
Fury!
Get
down!
Did
yöu
get
her?
Go.
That
thing
has
wings.
yöu
think
that
did
it?
Well,
he
can
fly.
OK,
Toothless,
time
to
disappear.
Come
on,
bud!
Here
it
comes!
Watch
out!
OK,
time's
up!
Let's
see
if
this
works.
Come
on!
Is
that
the
best
yöu
can
do?!
Stay
with
me,
buddy.
Hold,
Toothless.
Now!
No.
No!
Hiccup!
Son!
Hiccup.
Oh,
son.
I
did
this.
Oh,
son,
I'm
so
sorry.
Hiccup!
He's
alive.
Thank
yöu
for
saving
my
son.
Well,
yöu
know...
most
of
him.
Hey,
Toothless.
I'm
happy
to
see
yöu,
too.
I'm
in
my
house.
yöu're
in
my
house.
Does
my
dad
know
yöu're
here?
What?
OK,
OK.
Toothless,
no.
No,
Toothless.
Toothless!
Oh,
come
on.
OK.
Thanks,
bud.
-
Toothless,
stay
here.
Hold
on
tight!
Here
we
go!
What?
I
knew
it.
I'm
dead.
No,
but
yöu
gave
it
yöur
best
shot.
Hey,
look,
it's
Hiccup!
It's
Hiccup!
Turns
out
all
we
needed
yöu
just
gestured
to
all
of
me.
Well,
most
of
yöu.
With
a
little
Hiccup
flair
thrown
in.
I
might
make
a
few
tweaks.
That's
for
scaring
me.
What
is
it
always
going
...I
could
get
used
to
it.
Welcome
home.
-
Night
Fury!
yöu
ready?
This
is
Berk.
It
snows
nine
months
of
the
year
Any
food
that
grows
here
The
people
that
grow
here
The
only
upsides
are
the
pets.
While
other
places
...we
have...
...dragons.
