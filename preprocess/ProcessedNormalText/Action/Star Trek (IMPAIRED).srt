Scott.
Yeah,
it's
me.
You're
in
the
right
place.
Unless
theres
another
hard
working
-
Me.
You
aren't
doing
anything.
You
can
I'm
talking
about
food,
real
food.
But
you're
here
now.
So,
thank
you.
You
are
in
fact
a
Mr.
Scott
who
postulated
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
I
had
a
little
debate
with
my
instructor
on
the
issue
of
relativistic
physics
and
He
seemed
to
think
that
the
range
of
was
limited
to
about
a
100
miles.
I
told
him
that
I
could
not
only
beam
a
in
the
same
system,
which
is
easy
by
the
way
I
could
do
it
with
a
life
form.
So,
I
tested
it
on
admiral
Archer's
prize
beagle.
I
know
that
dog.
What
happened
to
it?
I'll
tell
you
when
it
reappears.
I
don't
What
if
I
told
you
that
your
transwarp
theory
was
correct?
That
it
is
indeed
possible
to
beam
onto
I
think
that
if
that
equation
had
been
The
reason
you
haven't
is
because
you
haven't
discovered
it
yet.

Are
you
from
the
future?
Well
that's
brilliant.
Do

She
is

well
endowed
lady.
I'd
like
to
get
my
hands
on
her
ample
nossels,
Except,
the
thing
is,
even
if
I
believed
you.
Which
I
don't,
by
the
way.
We're
still
while
she's
travelling
faster
than
light
Get
off
there.
It's
not
a
climbing
frame.
The
notion
of
transwarp
beaming
is
like
trying
to
hit
a
bullet
with
a
smaller
bullet
whilst
wearing
a
blindfold,
riding
a
horse.
What's
that?
Your
equation
for
achieving
transwarp
beaming.
You're
out
of
it...
Imagine
that.
It
never
occurred
to
me
to
You're
coming
with
us,
right?
No,
Jim.
That
is
not
my
destiny.
Your
destiny
...
He.
The
other
Spock
is
not
gonna
believe
me.
Under
no
circumstances
can
he
be
made
aware
So
you're
telling
me
I
can't
tell
you
that
I'm
following
Jim,
this
is
one
rule
you
cannot
break.
To
stop
Nero,

alone

How?
Over
your
dead
body?
Preferably,
not.
However,
there
is
Starfleet
regulation
619.
619
states
that
any
command
officer
who
is
must
resign
command.
So,
you're
saying
that
I
have
to
Jim,
I
just
lost
my
planet.
I
can
tell
you,
I
am
emotionally
compromised.
What
you
must
do
is
get
me
to
show
it.
Aye
then
lady.
Live
or
die.
You
cannot
come
with
me.
Go
on.

back

changing

I
learned
from

You

it's

Well

Jim.
Now

Yeah

is

I
am

as
I
once
was
as

You
will
always
be

I
am
grateful
for
this.
And
for
you.
I
feel
anger
for

An
anger
I
cannot
