Mary

Watson.
Oh,
boy.
If
she
only
knew
But
she
can
never
know.
I
made
a
choice
once
to
live
A
life
she
can
never
be
a
part
of.
Who
am
I?
I'm
Spider-Man,
given
a
job
to
do.
And
I'm
Peter
Parker,
Parker!
Parker!
No,
no,
no,
stop!
Stop!
Parker,
you're
late,
man.
Always
late.
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Aziz.
Another
disturbance.
Come
on,
21
minutes
ago,
Harmattan,
Burton
&
Smith.
In
eight
minutes,
I
am
defaulting

Then,
not
only
am
I
receiving
...but
I
will
lose
the
customer
forever
Look,
you
are
my
only
hope,
all
right?
Peter,
you're
a
nice
guy.
This
is
your
last
chance.
You
have
to
go
42
blocks
Go!
Hey,
what,
are
you
stupid?
Whoa!
He
stole
that
guy's
pizzas!
I'm
gonna
get
it!
Hey,
you
guys.
Yes,
Mr.
Spider-Man.
See
you.
Way
to
go,
Spidey!
Pizza
time.
You're
late.
I'm
not
paying
for
those.
Joe's
29-minute

I
know
to
you,
Parker,
a
promise
It's
serious
to
me
too,
Mr.
Aziz.
-
You're
fired.
Go.
-
You're
fired.
You're
fired.
-
Parker,
hello.
You're
fired.

Parker,
hello.
You're

We
got
six
minutes
to

Jonah.
I
don't
pay
you
to
be
a

artiste.
I
pay
you
because
that

He
won't
let
me
take
any
more

A
fact
I'm
very
proud
of.
Get

It's

Please,
isn't
there
any

Some
food
got
poisoned?
All
right,
Mr.
Jameson.
It
stinks.
"Masked
Menace
Terrorizes
Town."
I
told
you,
he's
not
a
menace.
-
I
told
you...
-
I'll
give
you
150.
That's
outrageous.
Done.
Give
this
to
the
girl.
Thank
you.
Bye-bye.
Hi.
Hey,
Pete.
I
don't
think
this
covers
the
advance
-
Right.
Hey.
Chin
up,
okay?
Watch
it,
jerk!
Dr.
Connors.
Sorry.
Where
were
you
headed,
Parker?
To
your
class.
My
class
is
over.
See
me
standing
here?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
trying.
Then
be
here.
Look
at
you,
Peter.
Your
grades
have
been
steadily
You
always
appear
exhausted.
Your
paper
on
fusion
is
still
overdue.
I
know.
I'm
planning
to
write
it
Planning
is
not
a
major
Octavius
is
a
friend
of
mine.
Better
do
your
research,
Parker.
Get
it
done,
or
I'm
failing
you.
Surprise!
Well,
say
something.
What's
the
occasion?
Really,
Peter.
It's
your
birthday!
Whether
you
want
He
lives
in
another
reality.
-
Hi,
M.J.
-
Hey,
buddy.
Long
time,
no
see.
So
how's
the
play?
It's
going
fine.
It's
going
good.
She's
brilliant
in
it.
Harry
sent
me
roses.
So
where
you
been,
pal?
I've
been
busy.
Taking
pictures
of
Spider-Man?
The
less
you
see
of
that
man,
Now,
let's
all
go
into
the
other
room
I'll
get
the
hors
d'oeuvres.
So
how
are
things
going
at
Oscorp?
They're
great.
We're
about
to
make
How
lovely,
Harry.
Your
father
Thank
you.
We're
actually
funding
-
I'm
writing
a
paper
on
him.
You'd
introduce
me?
You
bet.
Octavius
is
...in
a
way
my
father
M.J.,
could
you
give
me
a
hand?
She's
waiting
for
you,
pal.
What
do
you
mean?
The
way
she
looks
at
you
However
you
want
to
look
at
it.
I
don't
have
time
for
girls
right
now.
Why,
are
you
dead?
I've
been
kind
of
busy.
Taking
pictures
of
your
friend?
Could
we
get
off
that
subject?
I
want
us
to
be
friends,
Harry.
Then
be
honest
with
me.
If
you
knew
who
he
was,
May.
Oh,
what,
Ben?
Wait.
-
Aunt
May.
Oh,
Peter.
Oh,
for
a
second
there,
Everybody's
gone,
aren't
they?
Did
they
have
a
good
time?
I'm
sure
they
did.
-
You
okay?
And
be
careful.
I
don't
like
that
I'm
worried
about
you.
You're
so
alone.
Oh,
my.
You
did?
Oh,
well.
So?
I'm
a
little
behind.
Everybody
is.
Anyway,
I
don't
want
I'm
tired,
Here,
kiddo.
Happy
birthday.
You
need
it
more
than
I
do.
-
No,
I
can't
take
that
from
you.
You
can
take
this
money
from
me.
For
God's
sake,
it's
not
much.
And
don't
you
dare
leave
it
here.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
It's
just
that
I
miss
Can
you
believe
that
it's
two
years
I
think
to
myself
at
times...
...were
I
to
face
the
one
responsible
Oh,
I
don't
know
what
I'd
do.
Now...
...you
better
take
Hey.
Hey.
You're
still
here.
I
saw
your
billboard
on
Bleecker.
Isn't
it
funny?
Don't
be.
It's
nice.
I
liked
seeing
you
tonight,
Peter.
Oh,
boy,
yeah.
"Oh,
boy,
yeah"
what?
Nothing.
Do
you
want
to
say
something?
I...
...was...
...wondering
if
you're
still
You're
such
a
mystery.
Peter.
What?
Happy
birthday.
I'm
seeing
somebody
now.
You
mean,
like
a
boyfriend?
Well,
like
I
like
him.
What?
Nothing.
That's
good,
you
know?
May
be
more
than
that.
More?
I
don't
know.
I'm
coming
to
see
your
play
-
You're
coming?
Don't
disappoint
me.
I
won't.
Rent.
-
Hi.
Can
I
spend
it?
I
have
a
paycheck
due
this
week
-
You're
a
month
late
again.
Again.
If
promises
were
crackers,
I'm
really
sorry,
Mr.
Ditkovitch.
All
I
got
"Sorry"
doesn't
pay
the
rent.
And
don't
try
to
sneak
past
me.
I
have
-
Thanks,
Mr.
Ditkovitch.
Hello?
Rent?
Doctor?
Mr.
Osborn's
here.
Nobel
Prize,
Otto.
Nobel
Prize.
It's
not
about
the
prizes,
Harry.
But
you
need
money.
Who
do
we
have
here?
This
is
my
good
friend
He
got
me
through
Peter
Parker,
sir.
I
know
what
you're
doing
here...
...but
I
don't
have
time
But
Oscorp
pays
the
bills,
so...
That's
why
I
have
to
take
off.
But
my
job
is
done
here.
Good
luck
tomorrow,
Otto.
Interesting
fellow,
your
friend.
I
won't
take
much
of
your
time.
Now
I
remember
you.
You're
Connors'
He
also
tells
me
you're
lazy.
I'm
trying
to
do
better.
Being
brilliant's
not
enough,
Intelligence
is
not
a
privilege,
And
you
use
it
You
want
to
try
it
back
there?
So
is
that
it?
Yes.
My
design
to
initiate
I
understand
you
use
harmonics
Sympathetic
frequencies.
Harmonic
reinforcement?
Go
on.
An
exponential
increase
A
huge
amount
of
energy.
Like
a
perpetual
sun

Are
you
sure
you
could
stabilize
Peter,
what
have
we
been
talking
This
is
my
life's
work.
I
certainly
know
the
consequences
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
mean
Rosie,
our
new
friend
thinks
You
can
sleep
soundly
tonight.
Otto's
done
his
homework.
Come
to
the
demonstration
tomorrow,
And
you
need
Did
Edison
sleep
Did
Marconi
sleep
Did
Beethoven
sleep
Did
Bernoulli
sleep
before
he
found
Rosie,
I
love
this
boy.
Peter,
tell
us
about
yourself.
Well...
I
don't
really
know.
Well,
shouldn't
you
know?
Leave
him
alone.
Love
should
never
be
a
secret.
If
you
keep
something
as
complicated
...gonna
make
you
sick.
I
finally
got
lucky
in
love.
We
both
did.
But
it's
hardly
perfect.
I
met
him
on
the
college
steps,
He
was
studying
science,
That's
right.
I
was
trying
to
explain
And
Rosie
was
trying
I
still
don't
understand
-
Yes,
you
do.
T.S.

is
more
complicated
But
if
you
want
to
get
a
woman
to
fall
Poetry.
Never
fails.
A
tall
and
slender
maiden
Brightest

Rent!
Where
is
my
money?!
You
seem
jittery
tonight.
You
never
know
who's
coming.
Ladies,
five
minutes.
Five
minutes.
How'd
you
do
that?
Work
out,
plenty
of
rest.
You
know,
eat
your
green
vegetables.
That's
what
my
mom
is
always
saying.
Come
on.
Go.
Keep
it
steady.
It's
a
web.
Go,
Spidey,
go!
We
got
trouble!
Get
me
down!
I
am
more
than
content
His

alone
inspires

you
think
we
should

I
mean,
no.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey,
chief.
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You
might
want
to...
-
Can
I
help
you?
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
sir.
No
one
will
be
It
helps
maintain
the
illusion.
Miss
Watson,
she's
a
friend
of
mine.
But
not
to
come
late.
I
have
to
see
this
show.
A
Spider-Man
A-does
whatever
a
spider
can
A-spins
a

any
size
Catches

Look

You

you
don't
wanna
Yeah,
I'm
sure.
-
Okay.
Call
me.
-
You
were
great
tonight.
May
I
have
an
autograph,
What
are
you
doing
here?
You
hungry?
Starved.
What
was
that?
Okay.
Cool
Spidey
outfit.
Thanks.
Where'd
you
get
it?
I
made
it.
Looks
uncomfortable.
Yeah,
it
gets
kind
of
itchy.
And
it
rides
up
in
the
crotch
Hi.
It's
me.
Hi,
M.J.
This
is
Peter.
I
was
on
my
way
to
your
show
and...
Well,
I
was
on
my
bike...
Are
you
there?
I
really
was
planning
on
it
all
day.
And...
...I
know
you
predicted
Bingo.
It's
amazing,
isn't
it?
How
complicated
a
simple
thing...
...like
being
someplace
at
8:00
Actually,
there
was
Somebody
has
to
talk
Your
time
has
expired.
Please
deposit
50
cents
I
wanna
tell
you
the
truth.
Here
it
is.
I'm
Spider-Man.
Weird,
huh?
Now
you
know
If
my
enemies
found
out
about
you...
...if
you
got
hurt,
I
wish
I
could
tell
you
Ladies
and
gentlemen...
...my
wife
Rosie
and
I
would
like
to
But
first,
before
we
start...
...has
anybody
lost
a
large
roll
Because
we
found
the
rubber
band.
It's
a
terrible
joke.
But
thank
you
for
coming.
Today...

will
witness

if
the

as
advanced
as
you
suggest...
...couldn't
that
make
you
How
right
you
are.
Which
is
why
I
developed
...to
protect
It
means
I
maintain

of

And
now
on
to
the
main
event.
Give
me
the

light,
Rosie.
Precious
tritium
is
the
fuel
There's
only
25
pounds
of
it
I'd
like
to
thank
Harry
Osborn
and
Happy
to
pay
the
bills,
Otto.
Ladies
and

Doctor,

is

Thank
you.
We're

of

Keep
calm!
It's
only
a

Ladies
and
gentlemen,
We
have
a
containment
breach!
Otto,
please
get
back!
Shut
it
off,
Otto!
Shut
it
off!
It
will
stabilize!
It's
under
control!
I'm
in
charge
here!
It's
my
money!
I'm
in
con...
This
doesn't
change
anything.
-
What
are
you
doing?
No!
Rosie!
Watch
it.
That
was
too
close.
If
he
had
more
than
a
drop
of
tritium,
I'm
ruined.
I
have
nothing
left,
He
saved
your
life,
sir.
He
humiliated
me
by
touching
me.
The
press
will
be
here
soon.
What
was
he
doing
here
anyway?
Molten
metal
penetrated

fused
the

won't
know
the
extent

off
these

if
need
be,
...with
posterior
spinal
fusion
We're
ready,
doctor.
Anybody
here
take
shop
class?
Help
me!
Help

No!
It's

Pay
you
for
what?
The

night,
My
Rosie's
dead.
My

is
dead.
And
these...

Something...
...in
my
head.
Something
talking.
The
inhibitor
chip!
Gone.
Rebuild.
No.
Peter
was
right.
I
miscalculated.
I
couldn't
have
miscalculated.
It
was
working,
wasn't
it?
Yes.
We
could
rebuild.
Make
it
bigger
But
we
need
money.
Steal
it?
No,
no,
no,
I'm
not
a
criminal.
That's
right.
The
real
crime
would
be
not
to
finish
We'll
do
it
here.
The

Nothing
will

Nothing!

Yes,

At

we
get

Actually,
that's
only
Oh,
yes,
I
see.
Okay.
Don't
worry,
we'll
figure
it
out.
Peter?
Don't

Oh,
that

of
yours
is
a

Hold

Put
your

up!
All
of

Oh,
no.
Come

You're
getting
on
my
nerves.
Not
anymore.

Freeze!
Don't

Wait
a

Hand

over.
Easy,

Hi.
-
You.
But
there
was
a
disturbance.
I
don't
know
you.
And
I
can't
keep
thinking
about
you.
I've
been
reading
poetry
lately.
Whatever
that
means.
Day
by
day
he
gazed
upon
her
Day
by
day
he
sighed
with
passion
Don't
start.
Can
I
get
you
a
drink?
I'm
with
John.
He'll
get
me
my
drink.
John.
By
the
way,
John
has
seen
Harry
has
seen
it
twice.
My
sick
mother
got
out
of
bed
to
see
it.
Even
my
father.
He
came
backstage
to
borrow
cash.
But
my
best
friend,
...can't
make
an
8:00
curtain.
After
all
these
years...
...he's
nothing
to
me
It
pisses
me
off,
your
loyalty
to
I
find
him
with
my
father's
body,
-
Take
it
easy.
Don't
act
like
you're
my
friend.
You
stole
M.J.
from
me.
You
stole
my
father's
love.
Then
you
let
him
die
because
you
Huh?
Isn't
that
right?
Huh,
brother?
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
...that
the
beautiful
Miss
Mary
Jane
What
a
surprise.
Parker,
wake
up!
Wake
up!
Oh,
no.
No!
Why
is
this
happening
to
me?
You
seem
very
okay
to
me.
My
diagnosis?
It's
up
here.
You
say
you
can't
sleep.
There
is
one
dream
where...
...in
my
dream...
...l'm
Spider-Man.
But
I'm
losing
my
powers.
So
you're
Spider-Man.
In
my
dream.
Actually,
it's
not
even
my
dream.
Somebody
else's
dream.
What
about
this
friend?
Why
does
he
climb
these
walls?
That's
the
problem.
Gotta
make
you
mad
not
to
know
Nothing
as
bad
as
uncertainty.
Listen...
...maybe
you're
not
supposed
to
be
That's
why
you
keep
falling.
You
always
have
a
choice,
Peter.
I
have
a
choice.
All
the
things
you've
...make
me
sad.
Can't
you
understand?
I'm
in
love
with
Mary
Jane.
Peter,
all
the
times
...fairness,
justice...
Out
of
those
times,
...to
take
those
dreams
I
can't
live
your
dreams
anymore.
I
want
a
life
of
my
own.
You've
been
given
a
gift,
Peter.
With
great
power
Take
my
hand,
son.
No,
Uncle
Ben.
I'm
just
Peter
Parker.
I'm
Spider-Man...
...no
more.
No
more.
No
more.
-
You
punk!
-
Thanks.
Hurry
up!
And
when
the
borderline
is
tau
Someone,
please?
.23
electron
volts.
Excellent
work
today,
Parker.
I'm
not
really
wicked
at
all.
I'm
not
really
wicked
at
all.
If
you
are
not,
then
you
have
...in
a
very
inexcusable
manner.
I
hope
you
have
not
been
...pretending
to
be
wicked
That
would
be
hypocrisy.
Of
course,
I
have
been
"I
am
glad."
"I
am
glad."
"I
am
glad."
Are
you
glad
to
hear
it?
I
am
glad...
...to
hear
it.
In
fact,
now
you
mention
...I
have
been
very
bad
You
were
so
wonderful.
You
could've
told
me
I
was
afraid
you'd
say,
You
look
different.
I
shined
my
shoes,
pressed
my
pants,
I
do
my
homework
now.
You
wanna
get
some
chow
mein?
Peter...
...l'm
getting
married.
I
always
imagined
you
And
who's
the
groom?
You
hadn't
decided
yet.
You
think
just
because
...you
can
talk
me
out
You
once
told
me
you
loved
me.
There
was
something
I
thought
You're
too
late.
Will
you
think
about
it?
Think
about
what?
Picking
up
where
we
left
off.
Where
was
that?
We
never
got
on.
I
don't
think
it's
that
simple.
Of
course
you
don't,
You
don't
understand.
I'm
not
an
empty
seat
anymore.
I'm
different.
Punch
me,
I
bleed.
I
have
to
go.
I'm
getting
married
in
a
church.
You
are
different.
Dear,
we
agreed
to
put
on
a
wedding,
Caviar?
Get
some
cheese
and
crackers,
I
got
a
garbage
man
here
says
he's
If
you
have
an
extraterrestrial's
head
in
Where
the
hell
did
you
get
that?
In
the
garbage.
In
the
garbage?
He
must've
given
up.
Thrown
in
the
towel.
I
finally
got
to
him.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Now,
look,
I
think
-
Give
you
50
bucks.
All
right,
100.
Give
this
man
his
Your
wife
is
still
on
that
line.
Flowers?
How
much?
You
spend
any
more
on
this
thing,
Get
plastic.
Gotta
go,
big
story.
Spider-Man
Where
have
you
gone
to
Where
have
you
gone
to
Come
on,
man.
Get
the
money.
Come
on,
come
on.
Help!
Come
on!
It
wasn't
fair
to
have
gone
like
that.
He
was
a
peaceful
man.
And
it
was
all
my
doing.
Aunt
May.
Oh,
I
know
I
shouldn't.
It's
just
that
you
wanted
...and
he
wanted
to
drive
you.
If
only
I
had
stopped
him.
We'd
all
three
of
us
I'm
responsible.
For
what?
For
what
happened
to
Uncle
Ben.
But
you
were
at
the
library.
You
were
doing
your
homework.
He
drove
me
to
the
library,
What
do
you
mean?
I
went
someplace
else.
Someplace
where
I
thought
...to
buy
a
car,
because
I
wanted...
...to
impress
Mary
Jane.
It
happened
so
fast.
I
won
the
money,
and
the
guy
The
thief...
...was
running
towards
me.
I
could've
stopped
him,
...revenge.
I
let
him
go.
I
let
him
get
away.
He
wanted
a
car.
He
tried
to
take
Uncle
Ben's.
Uncle
Ben
said
no...
...and
then
he
shot
him.
Uncle
Ben
was
killed
that
night...
...for
being
the
only
one
And
I...
I
held
his
hand...
...when
he
died.
I've
tried
to
tell
you
so
many
times.
Just
one
more
little
chore.
Where
are
you?
-
I'm
leaving
for
the
night,
sir.
Your
father
only
obsessed
Good
night,
Bernard.
Hello,
Harry.
Otto.
What
do
you
want?
That
precious
tritium.
But
I
need
more
of
it
this
time.
More
tritium,
are
you
crazy?
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
All
right!
All
right,
all
right,
all
right.
Kill
Spider-Man,
On
second
thought,
How
do
I
find
him?
-
Peter
Parker.
He
takes
pictures
of
Spider-Man
Make
him
tell
you
where
he
is.
Have
it
ready.
Don't
hurt
Peter!
Somebody,
help!
Fire!
Alisa,
the
Chens
can't
find
their
Somebody
call
the
fire
department!
-
Help!
We
think
there's
a
kid
Hey,
where
you
going?!
I'm
coming!
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Come
here.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Mama.
You
got
some
guts,
kid.
Some
poor
soul
got
trapped
Oh,
man.
All
right,
Billy,
let's
knock
it
down
Let's
pick
it
up!
Let's
get
all
this
Am
I
not
supposed
to
have
What
I
need?
What
am
I
supposed
to
do?
I
shouldn't
have
without...
...knocking.
Come
in.
-
Hi.
Would
you
like
a
piece
Okay.
And
a
glass
of
milk?
That
would
be
nice.
Okay.
Thank
you.
You
got
a
message.
It's
your
aunt.
Thanks.
What's
going
on?
Oh,
they
gave
me
another
few
weeks,
I'm
moving
on.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
I'm
quite
able
And
Henry
Jackson
across
...and
I'm
giving
him
$5.
That's
Henry
Jackson?
Yes.
It's
funny
what
happens
Nine
years
old,
has
great
ambitions.
Listen,
about
my
last
visit...
Pish-posh,
we
needn't
talk
about
it.
It's
water
over
the
dam
or
under
But
you
made
a
brave
move
And
I'm
proud
of
you.
And
I
thank
you,
and
I...
I
love
you,
Peter.
So
very,
very
much.
Hey.
Where
are
all
my
comic
books?
Those
dreadful
things?
-
I
put
the
pans
in
the
box,
Mrs.
Parker.
-
Hi,
Peter.
You're
getting
tall.
Henry,
why
don't
you
put
those
Okay.
You
take
I
used
to.
Where
is
he?
Henry
and
I
agree.
We
don't
see
He...
...quit.
Wanted
to
try
other
things.
He'll
be
back,
right?
I
don't
know.
You'll
never
guess
Spider-Man.
-
Why?
Too
few
characters
out
there,
...saving
old
girls
like
me.
And
Lord
knows,
Courageous,
self-sacrificing
people...
...setting
examples
for
all
of
us.
Everybody
loves
a
hero.
People
line
up
for
them.
And
years
later,
they'll
tell
how
...just
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
one...
...who
taught
them
to
hold
on
I
believe
there's
a
hero
in
all
of
us...
...that
keeps
us
honest...
...gives
us
strength...
...makes
us
noble...
...and
finally
allows
us
to
die
Even
though
sometimes
...and
give
up
the
thing
Even
our
dreams.
Spider-Man
did
that
for
Henry...
...and
he
wonders
where
he's
gone.
He
needs
him.
Do
you
think
you
could
lift
that
desk
But
don't
strain
yourself.
Okay.
Strong
focus
on
what
I
want.
I'm
back!
I'm
back!
My
back.
My
back.
Honey,
you
sure
you
don't
want
to
Peter
Parker?
Positive.
Thought
he
was
your
pal.
-
Peter
Parker?
He's
just
a
great
big
jerk.
The
world's
full
of
great
big
jerks.
You're
adorable.
It's
just
the
uniform.
Lean
your
head
back
for
me.
-
Put
my
head
back?
Just
put
my
head
back?
Okay.
Wow.
I'm
back
on
the
moon.
You
up
there
with
me?
-
Hiya.
Very.
Thanks
for
coming.
Everything
okay?
You
might
say
so.
This
is
funny.
You
know
how
our
minds
-
Tell
me
about
it.
Some
part
of
me
heard
what
you
...that
you
were
different.
I
was
afraid
to
trust
you.
But
I've
been
thinking
about
it...
Listen,
there's
more
for
me
to
say.
I
maybe
rushed
into
things.
Wait
a
minute.
I'm
saying...
I
thought
I
could
be
there
for
you,
...but
I
can't.
My
mind
was
playing
tricks
too.
Do
you
love
me,
or
not?
I...
...don't.
You
don't.
Kiss
me.
Kiss
you?
I
need
to
know
something.
Just
one
kiss.
What's
happening?
Peter
Parker...
...and
the
girlfriend.
What
do
you
want?
I
want
you
to
find
your
friend
Tell
him
to
meet
me
I
don't
know
where
he
is.
Find
him.
Or
I'll
peel
the
flesh
off
her
bones.
If
you
lay
one
finger
on
her...
You'll
do
what?
Still
no
word
on
the
whereabouts
Sorry,
Jonah.
It's
all
my
fault.
I
drove
Spider-Man
away.
He
was
the
only
one
who
could've
Yes.
Spider-Man
was
a
hero.
I
just
couldn't
see
it.
He
was
a...
A
thief!
A
criminal!
He
stole
my
suit!
I
want
that
wall-crawling
I
want
him
strung
up
by
his
web!
I
want
Spider-Man!
Where
is
she?
Oh,
she'll
be
just
fine.
Let's
talk.
What
the
hell?
You
have
a
train
to
catch.
Help!
Help!
Help!
I
can't
stop
it!
-
It's
Spider-Man.
Tell
everyone
to
hang
on!
Brace
yourselves!
Any
more
bright
ideas?
I
got
a
few,
yeah!
Whoa,
watch
out!
We're
slowing
down.
Nice
and
easy,
we'll
go
down.
Slower.
Gently.
Is
he
alive?
He's...
...just
a
kid.
No
older
than
my
son.
It's
all
right.
We
found
something.
We
won't
tell
nobody.
It's
good
to
have
you
back,
He's
mine!
You
want
to
get
to
him,
And
me.
Me
too.
Very
well.
Where
do
you
want
him?
And
the
tritium?
Yes.
If
only
I
could
cause
you
the
pain
First
we'll
see
who's
behind
the
mask.
I
can
look
into
your
eyes
as
you
die.
Pete.
No.
It
can't
be.
Harry.
Where
is
she?
-
He's
got
M.J.
Tritium?
He's
making
the
machine
again.
When
that
happens,
she'll
die,
-
Now,
where
is
he?
...you
killed
my
father.
There
are
bigger
things
Harry,
please,
I've
got
to
stop
him.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm
talking
to
you!
You
got
what
you
needed
for
your
little
I
can't
let
you
go,
Not
that
anybody
could
stop
me
He's
not
dead.
-
I
don't
believe
you.
Surprise.
As
soon
as
you
get
free...
I
should
have
known
Osborn
Shut
it
down,
Ock.
You're
going
Well,
that's
a
risk
Well,
I'm
not.
Hang
on,
Mary
Jane!
Run!
Let's
see
you
scurry
out
of
this.
Now
what?
Dr.
Octavius.
We
have
to
shut
it
down.
Please
tell
me
how.
Peter
Parker?
"Brilliant
but
lazy."
Look
at
what's
happening.
We
must
destroy
it.
I
can't
destroy
it.
I
won't.
You
once
spoke
to
me
That
it
was
a
gift
to
be
used
A
privilege.
These
things
have
turned
you
Don't
listen
to
them.
It
was
my
dream.
Sometimes,
to
do
what's
right,
...and
give
up
the
thing
Even
our
dreams.
You're
right.
He's
right.
Listen.
Listen
to
me
now.
Listen
to
me
now.
Now,
tell
me
how
to
stop
it.
It
can't
be
stopped.
It's
self-sustaining
now.
-
Think!
The
river.
Drown
it.
I'll
do
it.
No!
Hi.
Hi.
This
is
really
heavy.
M.J.
In
case
we
die...
You
do
love
me.
I
do.
Even
though
you
said
you
didn't.
I
will
not
die
a
monster.
I
think
I
always
knew...
...all
this
time...
...who
you
really
were.
Then
you
know
Spider-Man
will
always
have
enemies.
I
can't
let
you
take
that
risk.
I
will...
...always
be
Spider-Man.
You
and
I
can
never
be.
Mary
Jane!
Hello?
Who's
that?
Son.
I'm
here.
Dad?
-
I
thought
you
were...
I'm
alive
in
you,
Harry.
Now
it's
your
turn.
You
swore
to
make
Spider-Man
pay.
Now
make
him
pay.
But
Pete's
my
best
friend.
And
I'm
your
father.
You're
weak.
You
were
always
weak.
You'll
always
Now
you
know
the
truth
about
Peter.
Be
strong,
Harry.
Avenge
me.
-
Avenge
me!
Call
Deborah.
The
caterer?
Tell
her
not
to
open
the
caviar.
Had
to
do
what
I
had
to
do.
Mary
Jane.
Peter.
I
can't
survive
without
you.
You
shouldn't
be
here.
I
know
you
think
we
can't
be
together.
But
can't
you
respect
me
enough
I
know
there'll
be
risks.
But
I
want
to
face
them
with
you.
It's
wrong
that
...half
of
ourselves.
I
love
you.
So
here
I
am,
I've
always
been
Isn't
it
about
time
somebody
Well,
say
something.
Thank
you,
Mary
Jane
Watson.
Go
get
them,
tiger.
