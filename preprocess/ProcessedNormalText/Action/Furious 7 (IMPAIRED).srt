DECKARD:
They
say
if
you
want
just
look
behind
you.
I
used
to
think
that
was
bollocks.
But
now
I
realize
you
can't
outrun
the
past.
When
we
were
kids,
you'd
start
fights
with
the
toughest
But
I
was
the
one
who
had
You'd
steal
from
the
corner
shop,
but
it
was
me
who'd
brave
the
old
man's
belt.
I'd
hoped
you'd
outgrown
it.
That
playing
the
gangster
made
you
harder,
smarter,
better.
But
deep
down,
I
guess
I
always
despite
everything
I
did
teach
you.
Still,
you're
my
flesh
and
blood.
So
you
remain
my
cross
to
bear.
Rest
now,
little
brother,
while
I
settle
your
one
last
score.
You
take
care
of
my
brother.
Anything
happens
to
him,
I'll
come
by
looking
for
you.



Here.
Hold
this.
Grenade!


Come
on,
Dom.
They
say
an
open
road
helps
you
think
about
where
you've
been,
So
you
don't
remember
any
of
this
yet?
That's
not
fair.
You
know
I
don't.
So
what
is
it
exactly
That.
Race
Wars.
We
used
to
come
here?
"Come
here"?
We
invented
it.






Keep
it
under
9,000
RPMs.
Kid's
gonna
fry
his
pistons
You
know
that's
not
my
style.
How
about
you
just
ride
on
this
one?
Are
you
ready?
I
know
you're
ready!

Go!




Hey,
nice
job.
WOMAN:
Hey!
That's
the
girl
I
heard
so
much
about.
Where
you
been
at,
ghost
girl?

WOMAN:

Ghost
girl.

Letty,
what
the
hell?
Huh?
Damn,
dawg!
You
never
could
take
a
punch.

Right,
right.
Hey,
man.
I'm
glad
you're
back,
man.
It's
good
to
see
you!
Good
to
see
you,
Hector.

-

All
right.
We
made
it,
Jack.
-
Yeah,
we
made
it!
Now
I
just
gotta
find
that
door
button.
Buddy,
where's
the
door
-
Hi.
-
Yeah,
of
course.
I'm
new
to
this.
Yeah,
you
don't
seem
No,
not
exactly.
Hey,
buddy,
you
gonna
Wait,
wait,
wait!
Wait,
high
five!
All
right.
Yeah,
buddy.
Appreciate
it.
Thank
you.
Don't
worry.
You'll
get
Yeah,
that's
what
I'm
afraid
of.
First
time
I
saw
this,
I
thought
it
was
kind
of
funny.
I
guess
now
the
joke's
on
me.
What
are
you
doing?
What
I
should've
done
a
long
time
ago.
LETTY:
Stop
it!
Look
at
it.
It's
the
truth.
That's
the
date
that
I
lost
my
memory.
That's
the
date
that
Letty
died
-
and
I
was
born.
You
never
died.
Do
you
know
how
hard
it
is
and
you
see
me
through
Every
beautiful
moment
we've
ever
had.
I
see
it
in
your
eyes.
I
can't
give
that
to
you.
I
got
nothing.
You
got
me.
And
you've
got
only
a
piece
of
me.
I
have
to
find
myself.
For
me.

Goodbye,
Dom.
You're
disappointed,
aren't
you?
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
last
arrest.
He
was
too
easy.
Target
didn't
even
run.
Ah,
it's
okay.
Gives
me
a
chance
to
hit
the
iron.
Also
lets
me
work
on
my
stamping
skills.
You're
a
terrible
liar.
See
you
tomorrow,
boss.
-
I'll
see
you
then.
I'll
stay
as
long
as
I
want,
woman.
-
I
knew
you
would
say
that.
Elena?
What's
this?
It's
the
letter
of
recommendation
Just
know
I
meant
every
word
in
there.
Thanks,
Hobbs.
Thanks
for
everything.
-
Come
on,
way
too
sentimental
right
now.
Get
home.
Good
night.
Okay.
Good
night.


Just
one
sec.
You
sure
as
hell
ain't
the
IT
guy.
So
you
better
start
talking
before
and
stick
it
right
Agent
Hobbs,
right?
That's
right.
I'm
also
the
last
man
on
Earth
whose
computer
you
want
You
just
earned
yourself
You're
under
arrest.
I
don't
care
about
your
computer.
I'm
here
for
the
team
There
ain't
no
goddamn
team.
It
was
just
one
man,
The
lady
was
right.
You
are
a
terrible
liar.


Goddamn
IT
guys.

Hobbs!
On
me!


Elena!



Hobbs?
Hobbs!



BRIAN:
All
right,
buddy.
Come
on.
Okay,
what
do
you
think?
Parking
brake
slide
Where's
Mommy?
I
don't
know.
She's
up
there.
Oh.

BRIAN:
Here
we
go.
Watch
your
head.

MIA:
Dom,
you
have
a
package
out
here!
It's
from
Tokyo.
DOM:
Tokyo?
What?
Is
Han
trying
to
convert
me
BRIAN:
All
right,
you
ready?
There
we
go.
-
JACK:
Yeah!
Hey,
cars
don't
fly.
This
one
did,
huh?
DOM:
Brian
in
a
minivan.
He's
struggling,
Dom.
He
doesn't
want
me
to
see
it,
but
the
white
picket
fence
is
like
I
tried
to
talk
to
him
the
other
night.
He
doesn't
miss
the
girls,
He
misses
the
bullets.
Let
him
settle
in.
Give
him
time.
How
does
nine
months
sound?
I'm
having
another
baby.
And
you
didn't
tell
him,
did
you?

You
gotta
tell
him.
I
don't
want
him
to
be
With
me.
He
will
never
be
disappointed
with
you.
You're
the
best
thing
Thank
you.

Yeah?
Dominic
Toretto.
You
don't
know
me.
You're
about
to.
Get
down!


Jack!
Jack!
Shattered
his
collarbone,
fractured
his
leg
in
two
places.
He
only
regained
The
first
thing
he
said
was,
He's
in
there.
Are
you
okay?
I'm
fine.
He's
waiting.
Let's
go.

Got
something
for
you.
Your
files.
Thank
you.
You
risk
life
and
limb
to
save
the
Jell-O
and
a
bad
'70s
TV
show.


You
know,
it's
got
its
perks.
-
Sponge
baths
ain't
that
bad.
I'm
sorry,
baby.
"Dad"?
Honey,
I
want
to
introduce
you
He's
an
old
friend.
Go
on
and
say
hello.
Dominic
Toretto,
right?
My
dad
said
he
kicked
your
ass
once.
Young
lady,
watch
your
mouth.
Your
dad's
on
heavy
pain
meds.
I
can
understand
-
I
doubt
it.
I
want
you
to
go
get
while
me
and
Toretto
Come
on,
lady.
Let's
get
some
cookies.
HOBBS:
Watch
that
mouth.
Who
did
this?
You
remember
Owen
Shaw?
The
one
we
tore
half
of
London
Well,
this
is
his
big
bad
brother.
Take
a
look
at
this.
Deckard
Shaw.
British
Special
Forces
assassin.
The
kind
of
unique
asset
that
no
government
Black
Ops
boys.
Worse.
They
created
a
monster.
They
felt
Shaw
was
a
necessary
evil
until
eventually
they
decided
he
was
unnecessary.
The
powers
that
be
felt
that
he
knew
The
asset
became
a
liability.
So
they
sent
in
20
elite
And
they
missed.
That
was
six
years
ago,
and
Shaw's
been
a
ghost
ever
since.
Until
now.
How
do
I
find
him?
The
official
answer
is,
you
don't.
He
killed
Han.
Almost
killed
my
family.
He
also
tried
to
put
me
Which
is
why
when
I
get
out,
he's
gonna
wish
his
mama
But
until
then,
is
stand
down.
Now,
you
know
I
can't
do
that.
I
do
know
you,
Dom.
Which
is
why
now
I
give
you
the
brother-to-brother
answer.
You
do
whatever
it
is
you
gotta
do.
When
you
find
that
sumbitch,
just
do
me
one
favor.
What's
that?
Don't
miss.

MIA:
Thank
you
so
much
I
hope
it's
not
a
problem.
MANDO:
Listen,
Dom
needed
That
was
a
problem.
Hosting
his
family
in
the
Anyone
messes
with
you
here,
they
mess
with
the
entire
country.
You'll
be
safe.


Yeah,
yeah,
they're
here.
Hold
on.
Your
brother.
Dom.
Yeah,
Mia,
it's
me.
How's
it
going
there?
We're
at
Mando's.
This
place
is
like
a
fortress.
You
should
see
Brian.
He
built
a
surveillance
hub
What
about
you?
Looks
like
the
sins
of
London
How
did
Buster
take
the
news?
I
can't
tell
him.
If
he
knew
about
the
baby,
And
with
all
that's
going
on,
Just
watch
out
for
him.
Keep
him
safe.
And
come
home
together.
-

Where
are
you
going?
Tokyo.
I'm
bringing
Han
home.
Authorities
are
still
the
motive
behind
this
daring
attack
of
the
US
Diplomatic
Security
Service
less
than
36
hours
ago.
Facts
are
still
coming
in,
but
what
is
known
is
the
suspect
entered
the
building's
fourth
floor...
Hey.
-
You
okay?
This
guy's
just
relentless.
That's
why
Dom
needs
you.
You
two
need
to
find
this
guy
before
he
does
any
more
damage
You
know,
I
just...
I've
screwed
up
so
many
things.
I
couldn't
live
with
myself
You
won't.
I
believe
in
you.
I
believe
in
us.
I
love
you,
Brian.
I
love
you,
baby.
Just
promise
me,
after
this,
we're
done.
No
more
jobs,
no
more
enemies.
Come
back
to
us.
I
won't
let
you
down,
Mia.
I
know.


Hey,
yo,
Sean!
Hey,
check
this
out,
man.
This
dude
over
here
Not
tonight,
Twinkie.
Said
he
knew
Han.
SEAN:
Han
said
you
was
fast,
DOM:
Who
said
American
Han
mentioned
he
left
his
He
never
talked
about
it
much.
Always
playing
it
close
to
the
vest.
We
found
a
couple
things
by
the
crash.
Wasn't
much
left.
Gisele.
Oh,
yeah.
There's
one
more
thing.
I
found
this.
Must
have
meant
something
to
him.
When
you
find
the
guy
that
killed
Han,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
Words
ain't
even
been
invented
yet.


They
say
to
live
in
the
hearts
is
not
to
die.
But
he
put
you
in
this
grave.
So
now
I'll
do
the
same
to
him.
I
can't
do
no
more
funerals.
First
Han.
Now
Hobbs
is
laid
up,
of
all
people.
We're
being
hunted.
You
know
he's
out
there
I
hope
so.
Means
he's
close.
Just
promise
me,
Brian,
no
more
funerals.
Just
one
more.
His.





You
never
should
have
I
told
your
brother
the
same
thing.
Reinforced
your
chassis.
It's
like
going
into
a
ring
Your
mistake.
I'm
not
here
to
play
games.
See,
you
and
me,
Trust
me,
I've
seen
a
lot
meaner
streets
Stick
around.
-
It's
gonna
get
a
lot
meaner.
You
thought
this
was

SOLDIER:
On
the
ground.
Now!

SHEPPARD:
Drop
him
or
I
will
drop
you!
Whoa,
whoa.
Easy,
guys.
Mr.
Toretto,
I'm
here
on
the
recommendation
-
Mr.
Hobbs.
Me?
I'm
just
a
guy.
I'm
Mr.
Nobody.
It's
a
big
entrance
for
a
nobody.
And
the
guy
that
put
You
just
let
him
get
away.
I
think
I
might
have
just
saved
Listen,
you
think
you
could
He's
beginning
to
turn
a
little
blue.
-
I
appreciate
that.
Ah,
here
they
come.
Listen,
Dom.
There's
a
war
going
on
You
and
your
team
unwittingly
and
it
appears
it's
It's
up
to
you.
I'm
gonna
have
a
beer.
You're
welcome
to
join
me.
By
the
way,
I
can
get
you
Deckard
Shaw.

Belgian
ale.
Oh,
man,
those
monks
got
it
right.
I
mean,
I
don't
know
but
when
it
comes
to
beer...
Would
you
like
one?
I'm
more
of
a
Corona
man
myself.
Ah.
Your
file's
not
only
detailed,
it's,
uh,
extremely
entertaining.
Look,
Shaw's
power
He's
really
good
at
getting
in
and
leaving
nothing
I
mean,
he's
a
legitimate
But
to
be
honest
with
you,
Dom,
I
don't
It's
you
I
want.
Because
you
and
I
can
help
I'm
listening.
MR.
NOBODY:
led
by
a
wanted
terrorist
kidnapped
a
hacker
known
only
Now,
Lady
Liberty's
got
her
panties
because
this
Ramsey
-
Bring
it
up.
Say
hello
to
God's
Eye.
Now,
this
little
bastard
hacks
into
That
means
every
cell
phone,
satellite,
Simultaneously.
If
it's
got
a
microphone
or
a
lens,
God's
Eye
can
find
you.
So
you
invited
me
here
On
steroids.
Lots
of
them.
Let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
It
took
us
nearly
a
decade
With
this,
we'd
have
located
him
in
a
couple
of
hours.
Now,
that's
a
serious
piece
of
machinery
that
could
be
catastrophic
But
for
some
very
nauseating
any
rescue
plans
involving
any
US
government
forces
or
entity
has
been
strictly
ruled
out.
And
that's
why
I
need
you.
But
why
do
I
need
you?
I
mean,
I
could
go
back
outside,
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
Coronas,
let
Shaw
come
to
me.
You
could
do
that.
How's
that
You
got
one
friend
in
the
ground,
And
then,
of
course,
that
destroyed
your
home.
Shaw
lives
in
a
world
that
doesn't
play
by
your
rules.
Like
it
or
not,
you
live
in
that
world
now,
too.
You
wanna
know
how
to
kill
a
shadow?
You
just
shine
a
little
light
on
it.
If
you
get
the
God's
Eye
for
me,
I've
already
got
authorization
for
you
to
use
it
until
you
get
Shaw.
You
go
from
the
hunted
to
the
hunter.
And
there's
no
place
on
Earth
More
importantly,
you
and
your
family
You
get
Ramsey,
you
get
the
God's
Eye,
you
get
Shaw.
Well,
that's
the
wind-up
and
the
pitch.
Now
that
I've
given
you
and
highly
classified
information,
I
think
you
already
know
Good.
But
it'll
be
my
way.
And
my
crew.
I
assumed
you
might
say
that.
Which
is
why
I've
taken
the
liberty
This
is
crazy.
What
the
hell
is
going
on
in
here?
MR.
NOBODY:
Our
intelligence
will
be
transported
through
the
Caucasus
mountain
range.
If
they
clear
this
range
Ramsey
is
as
good
as
gone.
ROMAN:
So
let
me
get
this
straight.
There's
only
one
road
sheer
drops
on
every
side,
a
motorcade
from
hell
from
one
mile
in
either
direction?
Yeah,
that's
about
it.
-
You
done?
So
you
all
wanted
me
to
break
into
a
police
station.
Fine.
Then
you
asked
me
to
stop
a
tank.
I
wasn't
happy
about
it,
but
I
did
it.
Then
you
came
up
with
to
shoot
down
one
I
shot
that
shit
out
of
the
sky.
Mmm.
It's
nothing.
But
this
right
here,
my
friend,
happens
to
be
the
stupidest
idea
I
forgot
that
you
were
the
only
one
No,
no.
The
only
thing
"No
Knees"
Denise.
Remember,
at
prom?
Really,
Brian?
-
See,
y'all
trying
to
get
me
off
my
point.
All
I'm
saying
is,
making
all
the
decisions.
This
time,
I
lead.
Seriously.
If
I
don't
start
All
right,
Roman.
What
do
you
got?
I
mean,
I
wasn't
trying
to
get
into
You
know
what
I'm
saying?
I
was
just,
kind
of,
talking
about,
Like,
you
know,
when
we...
Whatever.
I
mean,
I
think...
Let's
hit
it
from
here.
-
I
don't
think
that
that's...
That's
my
job.

Okay.
It
is
impossible
to
hit
it
there.
That
is
literally
the
most
secure
Why?
Because
you
cannot
See,
that's
what
makes
it
so
sweet.
Because
it's
the
place
that
they
As
much
as
I
hate
to
admit
it,
What
do
you
think,
Dom?
-
Here?
I
think
we
got
a
plan.
Completely
wrong
thinking.
And
I
like
it.
You
see?
I'm
good
at
this.
"Good"?
Okay.
SHEPPARD:
How
are
you
planning
Well,
Tej?
I
think
I
may
actually
What?
I
delegated.
Leader!
You
know,
when
I
was
reading
your

LETTY:
I

I
was
looking
for
you
everywhere.
You

the
shit
out
of
me.

LETTY:
You
will
never
be
alone.
DOM:
Tell
no
one.
Where
did
you
find
that?
Found
in
Han's
car.
It
was
left
as
a
message.
A
message
I
plan
on
returning.
Can
you
ride?
Yeah,
of
course
I
can.
Han
was
my
family,
too.
DOM:
Brian!
We're
gonna
need
long-travel
suspension,
limited-slip
differentials
BRIAN:
How

doing?
DOM:
Tej!
I
want
the
demon

between
that

TEJ:
That's
a
lot
of
armor.
It's
just
gonna
add
more
weight.
Slow
you
down.
This
time,

From

It's

Hey,

Listen,

it
takes
a
grown
man
If
you
need
to
cry,
As
your
friend,
you
know
I'm
concerned
which
is
why
I
took
the
precaution
of
putting
some
adult
diapers
Yo,
can
you
just
chill
out,
man?
MR.
NOBODY:
I
have
seen
but
this
really
could
make
some
waves.
So
let's
just
try
to
keep
it
DOM:
Don't
I
always?
I'll
tell
you
what,
you
knock
it
down
and
I'll
swap
out

You'd
be
doing
yourself
a
favor,
there.
Can
somebody
just
walk
me
through
Come
on,
Rom,
this
is
your
plan.
No,

was
not
my
plan.


Oh,

TEJ:

Because
you're
about

Okay,

Just

Oh,

Whoo!
Now

Everybody

Everybody

it
out?
You
just
didn't
tell
them
This
is
not
your
mission!
Hey,
Rom?
Hey,

up,
man?

I
can't
do
it.
Come

You

ROMAN:
Hey,

I'm
sorry
to
let
y'all

okay?
I'ma

here.
TEJ:
No,

What

ROMAN:
Hello?
Please,
man.
No!
The
trees!
BRIAN:
Oh,
shit.
Sit
tight,
Roman.
This
is
not
the

All

they'll
squeeze
whatever

That
ain't
gonna
happen.
I'll
see
you

Hook

Brian,
Tej,

Lock

Ramsey?
Stay

My

I'm
gonna

Look

Okay?
You're

Come

Well,

DOM:
Take
my

Welcome
to
the

Mr.

DOM:
Letty,

with
Brian.
Oh,

What
are
you
doing?
This
is
crazy!
Keeping
you
alive.
There's

Shit!

Too

Yeah!
I'm

You

Thank
you.

-
Roman,
get
back
to
the
others.
Don't
worry
about
me.


I
have
to
say,
I
am
impressed.
I
would
very
much
like
to
know
who
is
causing
me
so
much
trouble.
There's
no
way
out
of
there.
What
is
he
doing?
He's
frozen
like

Come
on,
Dominic.
Give
us
the

and
I'll
let
you
live.
What
are
you
going
to
do?
You
might
wanna
put
Helm...
Target
the
driver.

Damn
it!
What
is
he
thinking?
RAMSEY:
You're
insane!
You're
pointing
the
wrong
way.
Am
I
now?

Fire

my
mark.

Interesting.

One!
Fire!

way
down
a
mountain.
Where's
Ramsey?

Hello
Kitty
is
awake.
She
don't
look
like
a
hacker
to
me.
Oh,
yeah?
And
what
do
hackers
look
like?
They
don't
supposed
to
look
like
that.
I'm
just
saying,
like,
you
know
weird
glasses
that's
all
crooked,
and
pimples
all
over
their
face
I
mean,
trust
me,
with
a
body
like
that,
you
ain't
gonna
park
it
BRIAN:
How
are
you
feeling?
Did
you
hit
your
head?
Feeling
nauseous?
Ears
ringing?
No?
Where's
my
shoe?
Oh,
it
flew
off
when
you
crashed.
If
you
start
experiencing

I

You

what
I'm
saying?
Man,
sit
your

down.
The
disrespect
is
real
around
here.
Life
is
binary.
Zeroes
and

Only
two
things
keep
Fear
or
loyalty.
And
I
don't
see
a
drop
Very
impressive.
Just
one
thing.
They're
not

She's
so
off,
it's
crazy.
You're
telling
me
there

US
government?

DOM:
We
got
similar
interests.
Tej,
call
it
in.
We're
going
to
the
Middle
East!
BRIAN:
Hey.
Hey,
Dom.
It
was
pretty
wild
No,
it
was
too
close.
But
we
got
the
job
done.
You
know
what
the
crazy
thing
is,
is...
You
miss
the
bullets.

Yeah,
that's
messed
up,
huh?
DOM:
Brian,
I've
seen
you
jump
Hell,
I
saw
your
courage
Right.
Want
to
know
the
bravest
Be
a
good
man
to
Mia.
Being
a
great
father
to
my
nephew,
Jack.
Everyone's
looking
for
the
thrill,
but
what's
real
is
family.
Your
family.
Hold
on
to
that,
Brian.

It's
hotter
than
I
thought
it
would
be.
Yeah,
well,
we
are
in
the
desert,
Oh,
no,
I
ain't
talking

My,
my,
my.
Now,
that
is
a
woman
that's
worth
falling
out
a
plane
for.
Get
out
of
there,
man,
You've
seen
me
looking
at
that.
Did
you
just
say
"dibs"?
What
are
you,
in
the
fourth
grade?
ROMAN:
Man,
can
you
TEJ:
I
mean,
it's
a
free
market.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Rock,
paper,
scissors
for
her.
Are
you
guys
for
real
right
now?
Look
at
you.
You
both
look
whupped
already.
You
got
stalker
eyes.
I
tried
to
call
dibs
Her
knee,
my
balls.
Trust
me,
you
don't
wanna
do
that.
Hey!
Ramsey!
RAMSEY:
Hello,
Safar.
I
see
you
make
some
new
friends.
Yeah,

short-tempered
new
friends.
I

Why

it?
We're
gonna
need
it
back.
Impossible.
Safar,
I
stashed
something
inside
it.
Okay,
okay.
Uh,
good
news.
It
is
safe.
And
the
bad
news?
It
is
very
safe.
I
sold

Said
he
wanted
to

Now,
see,
this?
This,
I
like.
Billionaire,

What
makes
it
so
super?

And
it's
bulletproof.
242...
Am
I
the
only
one
aroused

now?

what
I'm
saying?
Whatever.
Where
does
he
keep
it?
In
his

Now,
why
in
the
hell
would

keep
He's

Sure.
But,

that.


What?
Is
something
wrong?
There's
a
billion
things
wrong.
But
not
in
this
moment.
You
look
handsome.
I
feel
awkward.

You

me
both.
Just
seeing
you
dressed
like
this
just
reminds
me
of
something.
Of
what?
Old
times.

You

Yeah.
I'm
fine.
Showtime.

No,
no,
no.
Listen,

They're
telling
me
On
this

crazy.
I

think
I'm
gonna
start
a
new
culture.

How
are
we
looking,

TEJ:

Okay,

It's

Are

Not
the

TEJ:
We're
playing
all
but
we're
gonna

Thank
God

up.
These
parties

now.
You've
got
an
army
heading
your

Brian,
get
out!
Forget
it!

This
is
what

Letty?
Letty,

to
me.
Are
you
okay?
TEJ:
Guys,
I
can't

it.
You
gotta
get
out
of
there.

Tear
out
the

Go
through
it.

Wait,

Time
to

MR.

Well,
well,
well.
I
have
to
say,
you've
got
an
interesting
interpretation
You
know,
Dom,
I
thought
Sometimes
you
have
to
play
That's
why
I
prefer
to
be
the
dealer.
Good
night.
Ah!
I'm
being
kicked
out
Uh,
may
I?
Brian,
give
it
to
him.
All
that
trouble
for
this
little
thing.
With
all
due
respect,

you
really
did
great
work
back
there.
All
of
you.
All
of
my
men
are
now
standing
by

are
fully
at
your
disposal.
Your
call.

Fire
it
up
and
find
me
Shaw.
Oh,
damn,
this
is
crazy.
Thank
you.
All
right,
give
me
a
second.
What
is
it
doing
now?
RAMSEY:
It's
hunting.
Hacking
into
the
security
cameras
That's
the
last
place
you
saw
Shaw,
That's
him,
right
there.
Wait,
wait.
What
are
these
It's
bio-mapping
Shaw's
face.
It'll
run
it
against
every
camera.
Every
audio
device
in
this
hemisphere.
Bingo.
Looks
like
he's
holed
up
here.
BRIAN:
That's
perfect.
Automated
factory,

people,
You
just
changed
the
face
Congratulations.
Hey,

I
check
my
email
real
quick?
DOM:
Dawn's
up
in
two
hours.
We're
gonna
go
take
down
Shaw
then.
Go
get
changed.
We
should
go
now.
Just
you,
your
team,
and
me.
I
thought
you
said
at
dawn.
My
guys
are
racers,
the
best
drivers
in
the
world.
But
they
ain't
killers.
BRIAN:
Told
you
he'd
say
that.
I
know

DOM:
I'm
ready
to
meet
my
maker.
Are
you?
DECKARD:
What
were
you
expecting,
Me
standing
here,
waving
a
white
flag?
You
ever
heard
the
saying,
"The
enemy
of
my
enemy
"is
my
friend"?
I
don't
have
friends.
I
got
family.
Well,
I
got
a
lot
of
friends.


Two-two

bad.
Look,
Toretto.
I
know
you
won't
listen
to
me.
You're
not
gonna
want
to
But
the
truth
is,
you
really
ought
to
try
that
Belgian
ale,
man.
It's
something
special.
Belgian
ale,
huh?

No,
you're
not.
I

MR.
NOBODY:
Dom,
As
long
as
she's
alive,
she
can
lock
them
out
of
God's
Eye,
That
means
they're
not
gonna

this
time,
when
they
come
they're
gonna
come
I'm
not
leaving
you.
You're
not.

I'm
leaving
you.
Go
now,
Dom.
A
war
is
coming
to
us,
If
a

is
coming,
we're
gonna
face
them
on

I'm
all
for
winging
it,
We
got
mercenaries
with

mean,
I
ain't
scared
Man,
I
don't
even
have
a
gun!
Gun?
We
got
a
whole
city.
TEJ:
And
we
may
have
more
than
that.
it'll
tap
the
cameras
Which
means
we
could
plant
a
virus.
And
then
break
in
when
they
access
it.
So
you're
talking
about
It's
brilliant.
Yeah,
but
there's
one
problem.
The
signal
strength.
We
can't
start
a
hack
on
them
-
That's
really
close.
These
guys
are
military.
If
they're
within
two
miles
of
us,
I
don't
know
about
y'all,
BRIAN:
Only
one
way
to
stay
alive.
-
We
play
keep-away
with
Ramsey.
BRIAN:
They
can't
hit
us
DOM:
And
I'll
take
Shaw.
TEJ:
So,
basically,
we're
just
gearing
up
RAMSEY:
Which
car
is
the
potato?
LETTY:
Why
does
it
feel
like

I'll
come
back
for
that.
Promise?
Promise.

-
Brian,
are
you
okay?
Something's
about
to
go
down.
And
if
you
don't
hear
I
need
you
to
take
Jack
and
move
on.
You
understand?
You
understand
what
I'm
saying?
No,
I
can't
do
that,
Brian.
No,
I
can't.
We're
gonna
have
another
baby.
It's
a
little
girl.

And
she's
going
to
need
her
father.
So
you
have
to
finish
what
you're
doing
and
you
have
to
come
home
to
her.
You
have
to
come
home
to
us.
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
tell
you
before.
I
was
scared
you'd
be
disappointed
You
know,
the
best
decision
I
ever
made
and
buying
that
first
sandwich.

It
was
such
a
bad
sandwich.

I
know,
right?
But
I
ate
a
lot
of
them.
Uh...
I
love
you,
Mia.
Don't
do
that.
What?
The
way
you
said
it.
It's
like
goodbye.
Say
something
else.
Okay.
Kiss
Jack
for
me.
I
will.
I
love
you,
Brian.
I
love
you,
Mia.
One
last
ride.
JAKANDE:
Boot
up
God's
Eye.
Find
them.

I'm
getting
something.
I
got
a
positive
ID.
It's
Toretto.
God's
Eye
is
placing
him
Should
we
follow
him?
No.
Let
Shaw
take
care
of
him.
Find
Ramsey.
Yes,
sir.
ROMAN:
I
don't
know
why
we
gotta
Why
can't
we
just
pull
over
somewhere,
park,
gather
our
thoughts
in,
Because
it
does
not
work
like
that.
We
gotta
stick
close
in
order
to
get
in
range
But
we
gotta
be
mobile
enough
So,
do
me
a
favor,
focus
on
the
mission
Got
her.
Target
acquired.
She's
riding
shotgun
in
a
blue
GT-R.
Guys,
they're
here.
How
many
cars?
Uh,
none.
And
that's
kind
of
the
problem.
Okay,
let's
give
them
the
tour.
Break
on
my
mark.
Three,
two,
one.
Go!
JAKANDE:
Splitting
up
won't
work.
Can't
hide
from
God's

They're
in
range.
Ramsey,

Initiating.
Now.
Sir,
I

someone's
trying
It's

Send

What
are
you
doing?
We're
going

school!


Watch
out!
RAMSEY:
It's
coming
back
around!

Predator's

him.

Ready

RAMSEY:

there.

Get

Why?
You
gotta
go!
Right
now!
Fire!

Come
on!
Hit!
He
made
it!
I
can't
believe
we
pulled
that
off.

MAN:
Wait,
wait.
We're
still
being
hacked.
God's
Eye
is
still
tracking

Keep

of

It'll

DOM:
Don't

LETTY:
Is

breathing?
I
want
you
to
keep
his
head
Keep

Pinch

Good.

Please.

I

But
I
want
you
to
listen.
Stay
awake
and
focus
on
me.
I
remember
everything.
It
came
to
me
like
a
flood.
I
remember
that
night
The
night
we
got
married.

LETTY:
Oh,
my...
DOM:
Will
this
do?

We
have
eternity
in
this
moment.
You
will
never
be
alone
again.
I
vow
wherever
you
go,
I
go.
You
ride,
I
ride.
You
fight,
I
fight.
And
if
you
ever
die
on
me,
I'm
gonna
die
with
you.
DOM:
I
love
you,
Letty.
If
you
die,
I
die.
And
I'm
not
ready
to
This
moment
is
still
ours.
I
remember
everything.
I
remember
it
all.
-
It's
about
time.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me
we
were
married?
Because
you
can't
tell

Holy
shit.

You
sure
you
brought
Oh,
they
ain't
mine.
They're
here
to
protect
you
from
me
killing
your
ass.


You

none
of
this

Well,
once

through
my
fist
and
a

So
I

Let's

Mama.
Yeah!
Here

ROMAN:
Because

sun
is

but
I
can
get,
like,
well
done.
What

me
for?
Close
your
mouth
for
two
seconds.
Just
open
your
eyes,
man.

Beautiful.
That's
where
he
belongs.
Home.
Where
he's
always
belonged.

Things
are
gonna
be
different
now.


BRIAN:
One
more
time.
You
aren't
going
to
say
goodbye?
It's
never
goodbye.

Because

You're
