All

None
in
production.

On
any
level
whatsoever.
What
did
they
tell
you
this
place
was?
BRUCE:
Earle
told
me
exactly
what
it
was
Dead
end.
Place
to
keep
me
from
causing
Come
on.
-
You
were
on
the
board?
-
You
knew
my
father?
Helped
him
build
his
train.
Here
we
are.
Kevlar
utility
harness.
Gas-powered,
magnetic
grapple
gun.
The
350-pound
test
monofilament.
Wonderful
project,
your
dad's
train.
Routed
it
right
into
Wayne
Tower,
Kind
of
made
Wayne
Tower
Of
course,
Earle
let
it
go
to
rot.
Nomex
survival
suit
Kevlar
biweave,
reinforced
joints.
-
Tear-resistant?
-
Bulletproof?
-
Why
didn't
they
put
it
into
production?
...a
soldier's
life
was
worth
300
grand.
So,
what's
your
interest
in
it,
I
want
to
borrow
it.
For
spelunking.
Spelunking?
Yeah,
you
know,
cave
diving?
You
expecting
to
run
into
Look,
I'd
rather
Mr.
Earle
Mr.
Wayne...
...the
way
I
see
it...
...all
this
stuff
is
yours
anyway.
Okay.
Give
it
a
try.
Charming.
At
least
you'll
have
company.
This
must
be
the
lowest
foundation
Your
great-great-grandfather
was
...secretly
transporting
freed
slaves
...and
I
suspect
these
caverns
Alfred!
Come
up
here!
I
can
see
everything
all
right
ALFRED:
We
order
the
main
part
BRUCE:
Indeed.
And
then,
quite
separately...
...we
place
an
order
-
Put
it
together
ourselves.
They'll
have
to
be
large
orders,
-
How
large?
-
Well,
at
least
we'll
have
spares.


[WOMAN
CHATTERING
Don't
suppose
you
want
a
taste.
I
just
keep
offering,
There's
nothing
wise
Well,
Jimbo,
you
don't
take
the
taste,
I'm
no
rat.
In
a
town
this
bent,

BATMAN:
You're
a
good
cop.
GORDON:
BATMAN:
Carmine
Falcone
brings
Nobody
takes
him
down.
Why?
He's
paid
up
with
the
right
people.
What
will
it
take
to
bring
him
down?
Leverage
on
Judge
Faden...
...and
a
DA
brave
enough
Rachel
Dawes.
Who
are
you?
BATMAN:
You're
just
one
man?
BATMAN:
We?
Freeze!
OFFICER:
Just
some
nut.
Well,
what
is
it
today?
No.
Today
it's
BASE-jumping.
BASE-jumping.
-
That
like
parachuting?
Do
you
have
any
lightweight
fabrics?
You
know,
I
think
I
have
just
the
thing.
It's
called
memory
cloth.
Regularly
flexible...
...but
put
a
current
through
it...
...molecules
realign,
it
becomes
rigid.
Can
be
tailored
to
fit
any
structure
Too
expensive
for
the
Army?
I
don't
think
they
tried
to
market
it
-
Look,
Mr.
Fox.
If
you're
uncomfortable...
Mr.
Wayne,
if
you
don't
want
to
tell
me
...when
I'm
asked,
I
don't
have
to
lie.
But
don't
think
of
me
as
an
idiot.
Fair
enough.
What's
that?
The
Tumbler?
Oh,
you
wouldn't
be
interested
in
that.
She
was
built
as
a
bridging

Not...
Not
now,
sir.
COMPUTER:
We
never
could
get
...but
this
baby
works
just
fine.
So,
what
do
you
think?
Does
it
come
in
black?
I
need
you
at
the
docks
Thursday.
-
Problems?
...with
the
last
shipment.
Word
on
the
street
is
you
got
a
beef
-
Is
that
right?
...waiting
for
anybody
willing
So,
what's
your
point,
Mr.
Flass?
Have
you
seen
the
girl?
FLASS
:
Don
't
you
think
that's
a
little
too
much
-
Even
for
this
town.
People
get
mugged
coming
home
Sometimes...
It's
a
problem
with
the
graphite,
sir.
The
next
10,000
-
At
least
they
gave
us
a
discount.
In
the
meantime,
sir,
may
I
suggest
Why
bats,
Master
Wayne?
Bats
frighten
me.
It's
time
my
enemies
shared
my
dread.
FLASS:
Continue.
Looks
fine
out
there.
The
bears
go
straight
to
the
dealers.
Yeah,
and
the
rabbits
go
-
What's
the
difference?
Don't
burden
yourself

Hey.
Steiss.
Steiss?
MAN:
What
the...?


I
better
check
it.

There's
a
problem
out
here.

Where
are
you?!
Here.


Take
a
ride.
Oh,
shit.
What
the
hell
are
you?

I'm
Batman.
Nice
coat.
Thanks.
Hold
it.
That's
right,
you
better
run.


Falcone
sent
them
to
kill
you.
-
Why?
-
What's
this?
-
For
what?
Who
are
you?
Someone
like
you.
Someone
who'll
rattle
the
cages.
Ma'am?
Everything
okay?
OFFICER:
Falcone's
men?
We'll
never
tie
him
to
it
anyway.
I
wouldn't
be
too
sure
of
that.
What
the
hell
is
that?
Cut
him
down.
LOEB:
Now,
I
don't
care
if
it's
rival
gangs,
...or
the
goddamn
Salvation
Army...
...get
them
off
the
street
They
say
it
was
just
one
guy.
It
was
some
asshole
in
a
costume.
-
Yeah?
...one
of
the
city's
biggest
crime
lords.
No
one
takes
the
law
Understand?
RACHEL:
No
way
to
bury
it
now.
-
I've
got
Faden
covered.
Even
if
these
guys
will
swear
...we've
got
Falcone
at
the
scene.
Drugs,
prints,
cargo
manifests.
Okay.
Let's
do
it.
-
Bats
are
nocturnal.
But
even
for
billionaire
playboys,
The
price
for
leading
a
double
life,
Your
theatrics
made
an
impression.
BRUCE:
...are
powerful
weapons,
Alfred.
If
those
are
to
be
the
first
...it
would
be
wise
Polo,
for
instance.
I'm
not
learning
polo,
Alfred.
Strange
injuries,
These
things
beg
the
question...
...as
to
what
exactly
does
Bruce
Wayne
What
does
someone
like
me
do?
Drive
sports
cars,
date
movie
stars.
Buy
things
that
are
not
for
sale.
Who
knows,
Master
Wayne,
...you
might
even
have
a
little
MAN:
-
We
have
a
situation.
The
Coast
Guard
picked
up
...heavily
damaged,
all
crew
missing,
The
ship
was
carrying
It's
a
microwave
emitter.
It's
designed
for
desert
warfare,
but
it...
It
looks
like
somebody...
...turned
it
on.
It
uses
focused
microwaves
to
The
damage
to
the
ship
The
weapon
itself
is...
Missing?
Yeah.
MAN:
Nice
car.
You
should
see
my
other
one.
WOMAN:
He's
done
something
MAN:
You
can't
take
the
law
Well,
at
least
he's
getting
MAN:
Bruce,
help
me
out
here.
Well,
a
guy
who
dresses
up
But
he's
put
Falcone
behind
bars.
MAN:
Now
the
cops
want
him.
They're
jealous.
Sir,
the
pool
is
for
decoration...
...and
your
friends
Well,
they're
European.
I'm
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
leave.
-
It
is
not
a
question
of
money.
...I'm
buying
this
hotel...
...and
setting
some
new
rules
I
think
the
Batman
deserves
a
medal.
And
a
straitjacket
to
pin
it
on.
MAN:
Bruce?
Rachel?
I'd
heard
you
were
back.
What
are
you
doing?
Just
swimming
here.
You
were
gone
a
long
time.
-
I
know.
How
are
things?
Job's
getting
worse.
Can't
change
the
world
on
your
own.
What
choice
do
I
have...
...when
you're
too
busy
swimming?
Rachel,
all
of...
All
this...
It's...
It's
not
me.
It's...
Inside,
I
am...
I
am
more.
WOMAN
1:
WOMAN
2:
Bruce,
we
have
Bruce...
...deep
down
you
may
still
be
But
it's
not
who
you
are
underneath...
...it's
what
you
do
that
defines
you.
WOMAN:
Not
at
all.
He
cut
his
wrists?
Probably
looking
for
the
insanity
plea.
Of
course,
better
safe
than
sorry.
Yeah,
Dr.
Crane,
I
can't
take
it
anymore.
The
walls
are
closing
in.
A
couple
of
days
of
this
food,
-
What
do
you
want?
...how
you're
gonna
convince
me
About
what?
I
know
you
don't
want
the
cops
to
take
And
I
know
about
your
experiments
See,
I
don't
go
into
business
with
a
guy
And
those
goons
you
used.
I
own
the
muscle
in
this
town.
Now,
I've
been
bringing
...so
whatever
he's
planning,
Well,
I
already
know
what
he'll
say.
That
we
should
kill
you.
Even
he
can't
get
me
in
here.
Would
you
like
to
see
my
mask?
I
use
it
in
my
experiments.
Now,
I'm
probably
not
very
frightening
But
these
crazies,
they
can't
stand
it.
So
when
did
the
nut

SCARECROW:
...much
as
you're
doing
now.
Well,
he's
not
faking.
Not
that
one.
I'll
talk
to
the
judge
...to
the
secure
wing
at
Arkham.
BATMAN:
The
scum
is
getting
jumpy
It's
a
start.
Your
partner
Well,
he
moonlights
They
were
splitting
the
shipment
in
two.
Why?
What
about
the
other
half?
-
Flass
knows.
He'll
talk
to
me.
GORDON:
Commissioner
Loeb
set
up
-
He
thinks
you're
dangerous.
I
think
you're
trying
to
help.
But
I've
been
wrong
before.


FLASS:
Flass,
I
have
kids
to
feed.
What,
they
don't
like
falafel?

Where
were
the
other
drugs
going?
I
never
knew.
I
don't
know.
-
I
swear
to
God.

I
don't...
I
don't
know.
They
went
to
some
guy
for
a
couple
days
Why?
There
was
something...
...something
hidden.
I
never
went
to
the
drop-off
point.
-
Cops
only
go
there
in
force.
No...!
FINCH:
-
What's
your
problem
with
it?
This
ship
left
Singapore
with
I'm
guessing
there's
something
Listen,
counselor,
we
don't
wanna
Things
are
working
a
little
FINCH:

It's
you,
isn't
it?
MAN:
The
other
kids
won't
believe
me.

Get
rid
of
all
traces.
MAN:
Better
torch
the
whole
place.

SCARECROW:
Take
a
seat.
Have
a
drink.
You
look
like
a
man
Do
you
want
my
opinion?

Alfred,
help
me.
Blood.
Take.
Take
poison.
Blood
poison.
Poisonous.
Poisonous.
THOMAS:
...why
do
we
fall?
-
How
long
was
I
out?
It's
your
birthday.
Many
happy
returns.
I've
felt
these
effects
before,
It
was
some
kind
of
hallucinogen,
You
have
been
hanging
out
I
called
Mr.
Fox
when
your
condition
FOX:
...isolating
the
receptor
compounds
Am
I
meant
to
understand
any
of
that?
Not
at
all.
I
just
wanted
you
to
know
-
Bottom
line,
I
synthesized
an
antidote.
You
planning
on
gassing
yourself
Well,
you
know
how
it
is.
...someone's
passing
around
I'll
bring
what
I
have.
Alfred,
always
a
pleasure.
Lucius.
-
You
sure
you
don't
want
to
come
in?
-
I
wanted
to
leave
this.
BRUCE:
RACHEL:
Looks
like
someone's
been
-
Must've
been
quite
an
occasion.
I
know.
I'm
sorry
I
can't
come
tonight.
-
You've
got
better
plans?
...which
means
I
should
...at
the
bottom
of
the
river.

RACHEL:
Rachel
Dawes.
Who
authorized
that?
Get
Crane
down
Call
Dr.
Lehmann,
tell
him
we
need
our

What's
wrong?
Dr.
Crane
moved
him
to
Arkham
Asylum
You're
going
to
Arkham
now?
You
enjoy
your
party,
Bruce.
-
Some
of
us
have
work
to
do.
Happy
birthday.
But,
Master
Wayne,
Keep
them
happy
until
I
arrive.
Tell
them
that
joke
you
know.

EARLE:
Bill?
Now,
what's
a
big
shot
like
you
I
need
some
information.
The
Wayne

47-B,

-ME.
It's
a
microwave
emitter.
It
was
designed
Rumor
was
they
tested
dispersing
...but
isn't
that
illegal?
I
want
all
the
information
...all
data,
files,
backup
disks,
Did
you
lose
one?
I'm
merging
your
department
And
I
am
firing
you.
Didn't
you
get
the
memo?
FALCONE:
Scarecrow.
Scarecrow.
Miss
Dawes,
this
is
most
irregular.
I
have
nothing
to
add
-
I
have
questions
about
your
report.
Isn't
it
convenient
for
a
52-year-old
man
...to
have
a
psychotic
breakdown
As
you
can
see
for
yourself,
there
is
-
Scarecrow.
Patients
suffering
delusional
episodes
...on
an
external
tormentor...
...usually
one
conforming
In
this
case,
a
scarecrow.

He's
drugged?
CRANE
:
Outside,
he
was
a
giant.
In
here,
only
the
mind
You
enjoy
the
reversal.
I
respect
the
mind's
power
It's
why
I
do
what
I
do.
I
do
what
I
do
to
keep
thugs
like
Falcone
I
want
my
own
psychiatric
consultant
...including
blood
work.
-
First
thing
tomorrow,
then.
I've
already
paged
Dr.
Lehmann
CRANE:
This
way,
please.
There's
something
This
is
where
we
make
the
medicine.
Perhaps
you
should
have
some,

Who
knows
you're
here?
Who
knows?
He's
here.
MAN
1:
The
Batman.
MAN
1:
What
do
we
do?
...when
a
prowler
comes
around.
-
Call
the

At
this
point,
they
can't
stop
us.
But
the

What
about
her?
I
gave
her
a
concentrated
dose.
The

only
take
so
much.

Can
he
really
fly?
MAN

Well,
we'll
find

Won't
we?

Taste
of
your

What
have
you
been
doing
here?
Who
are
you
working
for?
Ra's...
Ra's

You're

What
are
you
waiting
for?

Backup?
SWAT's

the

...I'll
be
right
behind
you,

SWAT's
on
the

-
Hey.
GORDON:
Crane
poisoned
her
with
a
psychotropic

Let
me
get
her
down
to
the
medics.
Get
her
downstairs.
Crane's
been
smuggling
his
toxin
...and
they're
dumping
it
-
What
was
he
planning?
Was
he
working
for
Falcone?
He
mentioned
someone
else,
She
needs
the
antidote
-
How
long
does
she
have?

What
is
that?
-
Backup.

Excuse
me.
BATMAN:
How
is
she?
I'll
get
my
car.
BATMAN:
Yours?
I've
gotta
get
me
one
of
those.
OFFICER
1:
He
is
in
a
vehicle.
OFFICER
2
:
It's
a
black...
...tank.
Stay
calm.
You've
been
poisoned.
I'm
on
him.
Breathe
slowly.
Hold
on.
-
What
are
you
doing?
OFFICER
3
:
He's
got
no
way
off
that
roof.
Turn
off
your
engine.
-
Trust
me.
Who
is
this
guy?
OFFICER

:
He's
on
the

OFFICER

What
street
is
he
taking?
He's
flying
on
rooftops.
At
least
tell
me
what
it
looks
like.
Never
mind.
Got
him.
Coming
right
up
on

There

Just

No.
They
put

all
in.

BATMAN:
Where
are
we?
-
Why
did
you
bring
me
here?
-
You
were
poisoned.
-
It
was
Dr.
Crane.
Is
Sergeant
Gordon
your
friend?
I
don't
have
the
luxury
of
friends.
I'm
gonna
give
you
a
sedative.
When
you
do,
get
these
to
Gordon,

What
are
they?
One
for
Gordon
to
inoculate
himself,
RACHEL:
Crane
was
just
a
pawn.
When
you
told
me
your
grand
plan
...all
that
stopped
me
...was
when
you
said

It's
not.

Damn
good

have

You're

It's

She's
downstairs,
sedated.
Well,
we
both
care
for
Rachel,
but
what
It
can't
be
personal,
-
Is
Fox
still
here?
We
need
to
send
these
people
away.
Those
are
Bruce
Wayne's
guests.
I
don't
care
about
my
name.
It's
not
just
your
name,
sir.
And
it's
all
that's
left
of
him.
Don't
destroy
it.
[GUESTS
SINGING
-
Mr.
Earle.
Thank
you.
How
did
the
stock
offering
go?
Prices
soared.
Who
was
buying?
All
kinds
of
funds
and
brokerages.
It's
a
bit
technical.
The
key
thing
is...
...our
company's
future
is
secure.
Great.
A
little
the
worse
for
wear,
I'm
afraid.
GORDON:
How
were
you
gonna
get
Scarecrow.
Scarecrow.
Who
were
you
working
for,
Crane?
Oh,
it's
too
late.
You
can't
stop
it
now.
GORDON:
MAN:
Happy
birthday,
Bruce.
And
thank
you
for
that
item.
You're
welcome.
-
I
know
you'll
put
it
to
good
use.
How
long
would
it
take
Weeks.
Why?
Somebody's
planning
to
disperse
The
water
supply
won't
help
you
What?
Unless
you
have
a
microwave
emitter
...to
vaporize
all
the
water
A
microwave
emitter
like
the
one
Misplaced?
Earle
just
fired
me
for
asking
Go
back
to
Wayne
Enterprises
now
The
police
are
gonna
need
as
much
My
security
clearance
That
wouldn't
stop
a
man
like
you,
I
suppose
not.
-
Bruce,
there's
somebody
you
must
meet.
Now,
am
I
pronouncing
this
right...
...Mr.
Ra's
al
Ghul?
You're
not
Ra's
al
Ghul.
I
watched
him
die.
DUCARD:
Are
his
methods
supernatural?
Or
cheap
parlor
tricks
to
conceal
Surely
a
man
who
spends
his
nights
...wouldn't
begrudge
me
dual
identities.
I
saved
your
life.
I
warned
you
about
compassion,
Bruce.
Your
quarrel
is
with
me.
You
let
these
people
go.
You
are
welcome
to
explain
BRUCE:
Everybody?
I...
I
want
to
thank
you
all
for
coming
here

No,
really.
There's
a
thing
about
being
a
Wayne...
...that
you're
never
short
of
...to
fill
up
your
mansion
with.
-
That's
enough,
Bruce.
To
all
of
you...
All
of
you
phonies,
...you
sycophantic
suck-ups
...please,
leave
me
in
peace.
Please
go.
Stop
smiling,
it's
not
a
joke.
The
party's
over,
get
out.
The
apple
has
fallen
very
far
He's
turning
into
a
jerk.
Amusing.
But
pointless.
Your
antics
at
the
asylum
So
Crane
was
working
for
you.
His
toxin
is
derived
from
the
organic
He
was
able
to
weaponize
it.
He's
not
a
member
of
Of
course
not.
He
thought
our
plan
But
really,
you
are
gonna
release
Then
watch
Gotham
tear
itself
apart
BRUCE:
DUCARD:
Only
a
cynical
man
would
call
Crime.
Despair.
This
is
not
how
man
The
League
of
Shadows
has
been
...for
thousands
of
years.
We
sacked
Rome.
Burned
London
to
the
ground.
Every
time
a
civilization
reaches
...we
return
to
restore
the
balance.
Gotham
isn't
beyond
saving.
Give
me
more
time.
You're
defending
a
city
so
corrupt...
...we
have
infiltrated
Time
to
play.
When
I
found
you
in
that
jail,
But
I
believed
in
you.
I
took
away
your
fear,
You
were
my
greatest
student.
It
should
be
you
standing
by
my
side,
I'll
be
standing
where
I
belong.
Between
you
No
one
can
save
Gotham.
When
a
forest
grows
too
wild,
Tomorrow
the
world
will
watch
in
horror
The
movement
back
to
harmony
-
You
attacked
Gotham
before?
Over
the
ages
our
weapons
With
Gotham
we
tried
a
new
one.
But
we
underestimated
certain
...such
as
your
parents.
Gunned
down
by
one
of
the
very
people
Create
enough
hunger
Their
deaths
galvanized
the
city
...and
Gotham
has
limped
on
We
are
back
to
finish
the
job.
And
this
time
no
misguided
idealists
Like
your
father,
you
lack
the
courage
If
someone
stands
in
the
way
...you
simply
walk
up
behind
them
-
I
am
gonna
stop
you.
...to
mind
your
surroundings.
Justice
is
balance.
You
burned
my
house
Consider
us
even.
No
one
comes
out.
Make
sure.
GORDON:
-
How
many
from
maximum
security?
Serial
killers,
rapists.
Raise
the
bridges.
FLASS:
...when
I
get
every
available
unit
out
here
...that
are
running
loose
out
there.
I
hope
you're
not
a
member
Master
Wayne!
Master
Wayne!
What
is
the
point
of
all
those
pushups

BRUCE:
Everything
my
family...
...my
father,
built...
The
Wayne
legacy
is
more
I
wanted
to
save
Gotham.
I
failed.
Why
do
we
fall,
sir?
So
that
we
can
learn
You
still
haven't
given
up
on
me?
Never.
GORDON:
MAN:
Maybe
you'd
like
to
see
Madman
with
a
gun.
WOMAN
:
...at
the
unprecedented
show
of
police
We're
about
to
raise
these
bridges.
Officer,
I
am
a
Gotham
City
-
Just
shut
up!
OFFICER
1:
OFFICER
2:
Hey,
Gordon.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
It
counteracts
Crane's
toxin.
Hopefully
you
won't
need
it.
Not
unless
he's
got
some
way
All
right,
last
one
across.
OFFICER
1:
People,
they
want
this
Better
get
you
off
the
island
before
Go!

I
can't
find
my
mom.
RACHEL:
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
DUCARD:
...time
to
spread
the
word.
And
the
word
is...
...panic.
Jesus.
The
pressure,
it's
spiking.

Right
there.
MAN:
That
water
main

RACHEL:

This
is
Commissioner
Loeb.
Come
on,
somebody
talk
to
me.
Come
on!
GORDON:
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
We
need
reinforcements.
Gordon!
All
the
city's
riot
police
GORDON
:
It's
okay,
it's
okay.
SCARECROW:
-
Crane?
Gordon...
...there's
nobody
left
to
send
in.
GORDON:
The
Narrows
is
tearing
itself
to
pieces.
This
is
just
the
beginning.
...there's
nothing
to
stop
Gotham
-
How
are
they
gonna
do
that?
The
monorail
follows
the
water
mains
to
If
the
machine
gets
to
the
station...
...it'll
cause
a
chain
reaction
Covering
Gotham
in
this
poison.
I'm
gonna
stop
him
from
loading
-
What
do
you
need?
SCARECROW:
There
is
nothing
to
fear...
...but
fear
itself!
I
am
here
to
help
you!

Batman
will
save
us.
He'll
come.
-
He'll
come.
This
is
Gordon.
I
told
you
he'd
come.
RACHEL:
You
could
die.
At
least
tell
me
your
name.
It's
not
who
I
am
underneath...
...but
what
I
do
that
defines
me.
Bruce?
Well,
well.
You
took
my
advice
-
It
ends
here.
My
fight,
however,
Now,
if
you'll
excuse
me,
-
I
can't
beat
two
of
your
pawns?
COMPUTER:
In
100
yards.
DUCARD:
Who
the
hell
authorized
this?
COMPUTER:
The
pressure's
moving
along
the
mains,
If
that
pressure
reaches
us...
...the
water
supply
right
across
COMPUTER:
You
will
never
learn.
Sorry.
-
Familiar.
Don't
you
have
anything
new?
COMPUTER:
MAN:
We're
on
top
of
the
main
hub
COMPUTER:
Nice
ride.
COMPUTER:

Don't
be
afraid,
Bruce.
Come
on.
Come
on.
DUCARD:
That's
why
you
couldn't
fight
injustice,
Who
said
anything
about
stopping
it?
Yes!
BATMAN:
You
never
learned
Have
you
finally
learned
to
do
I
won't
kill
you...
...but
I
don't
have
to
save
you.
JESSICA:
The
meeting's
already
started.
Fox,
I
seem
to
remember
firing
you.
You
did.
I
got
another
job.
Yours.
On
whose
authority?
ALFRED:
Batman
may
...but
Bruce
Wayne

Bruce
Wayne.
What
makes
you
think
you
can
decide
-
The
fact
that
I'm
the
owner.
The
company
went
public
a
week
ago.
And
I
bought
most
of
the
shares.
Through
various
charitable
foundations
Look,
it's
all
a
bit
technical,
...is
that
my
company's
future
Right,
Mr.
Fox?
FOX:
Didn't
you
get
the
memo?
-
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
tell
you,
Rachel.
...I'm
sorry.
The
day
that
Chill
died,
I...
I
said
terrible
things.
But
true
things.
I
was
a
coward
with
a
gun...
...and
justice
is
about
more
I
never
stopped
thinking
about
you.
About
us.
And
when
I
heard
you
were
back,
I...
I
started
to
hope.
But
then
I
found
out
about
your
mask.
Batman's
just
a
symbol,
Rachel.
No.
This...
...is
your
mask.
Your
real
face
is
the
one
The
man
I
loved...
...the
man
who
vanished...
...he
never
came
back
at
all.
But
maybe
he's
still
Maybe
someday,
...I'll
see
him
again.
-
Proved
me
wrong,
you
know.
Your
father
would
be
very
proud
of
you.
Just
like
me.
RACHEL:
Rebuild
it.
Just
the
way
it
was,
brick
for
brick.
Just
the
way
it
was,
sir?
Yeah,
why?
I
thought
this
might
be
...improving
the
foundations.
-
In
the
southeast
corner?
-
Nice.
BATMAN:
Well,
sergeant?
You
really
started
something.
Bent
cops
running
scared.
Hope
on
the
streets.
-
But?
And
we
still
haven't
picked
up
Crane
or
We
will.
We
can
bring
Gotham
back.
-
What
about
escalation?
We
start
carrying
semiautomatics,
We
start
wearing
Kevlar,
-
And?
...and
jumping
off
rooftops.
Now,
take
this
guy.
Armed
robbery,
double
homicide.
Got
a
taste
for
the
theatrical,
like
you.
Leaves
a
calling
card.
I'll
look
into
it.
I
never
said
thank
you.
And
you'll
never
have
to.
