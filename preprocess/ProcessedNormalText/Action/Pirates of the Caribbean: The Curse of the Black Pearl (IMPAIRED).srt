No.

Run

Abandon

That's

to

When
I

I
came
out

Is
that
so?

I
wanted,

Jack.
You
knew
my
father.
I
knew
him.
Probably
one
of
the
few
Everyone
else
called
him
Bootstrap?
Good
man.
I
swear,
you
look
just
like
him.
It's
not
true.
He
was
a
merchant
sailor.
A
respectable
man
He
was
a
bloody
pirate.
My
father
was
not
a
pirate.
Put
it
away,
son.
It's
not
worth
You
ignored
the
rules
In
a
fair
fight,
I'd
kill
you.

that's
not
much
incentive
Now,
as

as

you
can

you
can't.

in
your

so
you'll
have
to
square
Now,
me,
for
example.
I
can
let
you
drown.
But
I
can't
bring
this

all
by

So.
Can
you
sail
under
the
command
Or
can
you
not?
Tortuga?
Tortuga.
More
importantly,
that
has
never
breathed
deep
that
is
Tortuga,
savvy?
What
do
you
think?
It'll
linger.
I'll
tell
you,
mate,
if
every

no

ever
feel
unwanted.
Scarlett!
Not
sure
I
deserved
that.
Not
sure
I
deserved
that.
Giselle!
Giselle!
Who
was
she?
What?
I
may
have
deserved
that.
Curse
you
for
breathing,
Mother's
love!
Jack!
You
should
know
better
than
to
It's
bad
luck.
Fortunately,
The
man
who
did
the
waking
buys
the
man
who
was
sleeping
The
man
who
was
sleeping
drinks
from
the
man
who
did
the
waking.
Aye,
that'll
about
do
it.
Blast!
That
was
for
the
smell.
Keep
a
sharp
eye.
Now,
what's
the
nature
Now,
what's
the
nature
I'm
going
after
the
Black
Pearl.
I
know
where
it's
going
to
be,
Jack,
it's
a
fool's
errand.
You
know
better
than
me
That's
why
I
know
All
I
need
is
a
crew.
From
what
I
hear
of
Barbossa,
he's
not
a
man
to
suffer
fools,
I'd
say
it's
a
good
thing
Prove
me
wrong.
What
makes
you
think
Barbossa
Let's
just
say
The
kid?
That
is
the
child
His
only
child,
savvy?
Is
he,
now?
"Leverage,"
says
you.
"l
think
I
feel
a
change
I'll
find
us
a
crew.
There's
bound
to
be
some
sailors
One
can
only
hope.
Take
what
you
can.
Give
nothing
back.
Give
nothing
back.
You'll
be
dining
And
he
requests
you
wear
this.
You
tell
the
captain
that
I
am
disinclined
He
said
you'd
say
that.
He
also
said,
you'll
be
dining
with
the
crew.
And
you'll
be
naked.
Fine.
There's
no
need
to
stand
on
You
must
be
hungry.
Try
the
wine.
And
the
apples.
One
of
those
next?
It's
poisoned.
There
would
be
no
sense
Release
me.
I'm
of
no
further
value
to
you.
You
don't
know
what
this
is,
It's
a
pirate
medallion.
This
is
Aztec
gold.
One
of
882
identical
pieces
they
delivered
in
a
stone
chest
Blood
money
paid
he
wreaked
upon
them
But
the
greed
of
Corts
So
the
heathen
gods
placed
Any
mortal
that
removes
but
a
single
piece
shall
be
punished
for
eternity.
I
hardly
believe
in
ghost
I
hardly
believe
in
ghost
Aye.
That's
exactly
what
I
thought
Buried
on
an
island
of
dead
except
for
those
Find
it,
we
did.
There
be
the
chest.
Inside
be
the
gold.
And
we
took
them
all.
We
spent
them
and
traded
them
and
frittered
them
away
and
pleasurable
company.
The
more
we
gave
them
away,
the
drink
would
not
satisfy,
food
turned
to
ash
and
all
the
pleasurable
company
and
all
the
pleasurable
company
could
not
slake
our
lust.
We
are
cursed
men,
Miss
Turner.
Compelled
by
greed,
we
were,

There
is
one
way
All
the
scattered
pieces
must
be
restored
Thanks
to
ye,
And
the
blood
to
be
repaid?
That's
why
there's
no
sense
Apple?
Arr!
No!
I'm
curious.
After
killing
me,
what
is
it
Aah!
Aaaah!

Look!
The
moonlight
shows
us
We
are
not
among
the
living,
We
are
not
among
the
living,
But
neither
are
we
dead.
For
too
long
I've
been
parched
Too
long
I've
been
starving
Too
long
I've
been
starving
I
feel
nothing.
Not
the
wind
on
my
face
nor
the
warmth
You
best
start
believing
You're
in
one!


What
are
you
looking
at?
You
heard
the
captain.
GlBBS:
All
of
them
faithful
hands
Every
man
worth
his
salt.
And
crazy
to
boot.
So
this
is
-You,
sailor!
Mr.
Cotton,
do
you
have
and
stay
true
in
the
face
Mr.
Cotton!
He's
a
mute.
Poor
devil
He
trained
the
parrot
No
one's
yet
figured
how.
Mr.
Cotton's
parrot.
Same
question.

Wind
in
the
sails!
Mostly
we
figure
Of
course
it
does.
Satisfied?
Well,
you've
proved
they're
mad.
WOMAN:
Anamaria.
I
suppose
No,
that
one
I
deserved.
You
stole
my
boat!
Actually
--
Borrowed.
But
with
every
intention
But
you
didn't!
You'll
get
another
one.
I
will.
A
better
one.
A
better
one!
That
one.
What
one?
That
one?
Aye,
that
one.
-What
say
you?
TOGETHER:
PARROT:
No,
no,
it's
frightful
bad
luck
It'll
be
far
worse
How
can
we
sail
to
an
island
with
a
compass
Aye,
the
compass
but
we're
not
trying
We
should
drop
canvas,
sir.
She
can
hold
a
bit
longer.
What's
in
your
head
that's
We're
catching
up.
Time
to
go,
poppet.
RAGETTl:
Dead
men
tell
no
tales.
Puts
a
chill
in
the
bones
how
many
honest
sailors
have
How
is
it
that
Jack
Not
a
lot's
known
about
Jack
with
a
mind
to
go
after
the
That
was
before
I'd
met
him.
Back
when
he
was
Captain
What?
He
failed
to
mention
that.
He
plays
things
And
a
hard-learned
lesson
Three
days
out,
and
says
everything's
That
should
mean
the
location
Jack
gives
up
the
bearings.
That
night,
there
was
a
mutiny.
They
marooned
Jack
on
an
island
but
not
before
he'd
gone
mad
So
that's
the
reason
Reason's
got
nothing
Now,
Will,
he's
a
given
a
pistol
with
Well,
that
won't
do
much
good
But
after
three
weeks
that
pistol
will
start
But
Jack
escaped
the
island,
and
Oh,
he
won't
use
it,
His
mutinous
first
mate.
-Barbossa.
How
did
Jack
get
off
the
island?
Well,
I'll
tell
ye.
He
waded
out
into
the
shallows.
He
waited
there
till
all
manner
of
sea
creatures
'came
acclimated
And
on
the
fourth
morning,
he
roped
Iashed
them
together,
He
roped
a
couple
Aye,
sea
turtles.
What
did
he
use
for
rope?
Human
hair.
From
my
back.
Let
go
the
anchor!
TOGETHER:
Young
Mr.
Turner
and
l
Young
Mr.
Turner
and
l
Captain,
what
if
the
worst
Keep
to
the
Code.
Aye,
the
Code.
Move.
10
years
of
hoarding
swag.
And
now
we
finally
Once
we're
quit
of
the
curse,
You
can
buy
an
eye
what
actually
This
one
does
splinter
Stop
rubbing
it.
What
Code
is
Gibbs
to
keep
to
Pirate's
Code.
Any
man
who
falls
behind
No
heroes
amongst
thieves?
For
having
such
you're
well
on
your
way
Sprung
a
man
from
jail,
commandeered
a
ship
sailed
with
a
buccaneer
crew
And
you're
completely
That's
not
true.
Not
all
treasure
CAPT.
BARBOSSA:
Our
salvation
is
nigh!
Our
torment
is
near
an
end.
Elizabeth.
For
10
years
and
each
man
jack
of
you
here
has
proved
his
mettle
and
a
hundred
times
again!
Suffered,
I
have!
Punished,
we
were,
Disproportionate
to
our
crime!
Here
it
is!
The
cursed
treasure
Every
last
piece
that
went
Save
for
this.
Jack!
JACK:
Not
yet.
We
wait
881
we
found,
but
despaired
When's
that?
When
it's
May
I
ask
you
something?
Have
I
ever
given
you
reason
Do
us
a
favor.
I
know
it's
difficult
for
you,
and
try
not
to
do
And
who
among
us
has
paid
owed
to
the
heathen
gods?
TOGETHER:
And
whose
blood
TOGETHER:
You
know
the
first
thing
after
the
curse
is
lifted?
Eat
a
whole
bushel
of
apples.

Begun
by
blood.
By
blood
undone.
Sorry,
Jack.
That's
it?
Waste
not.

Did
it
work?
-I
don't
feel
no
different.
You're
not
dead.
No.
