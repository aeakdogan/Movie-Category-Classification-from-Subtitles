ALL:

Happy
birthday
to
you!
WESLEY:
It's
my
anorexic
boss'
birthday.

This
means
there's
a
certain
amount
of
to
stand
around
the
conference
table
eating
crappy
food
That's
so
good.
WESLEY:
Acting
for
five
minutes
like
Janice
is
the
hardest
work
I'll
do
all
day.
My
job
title
is
account
manager.
I
used
to
be
called
but
a
consultant
told
us
we
needed
and
not
service
them.


I
have
a
girlfriend
whom
That's
my
best
friend,
Barry,
I
picked
up
for
a
really
good
price.
I'm
finding
it
hard
to
care
about
In
fact,
the
only
thing
I
do
care
about
Seriously.
It
worries
me.
My
name
is
Wesley
Gibson.
My
dad
walked
out
on
my
mom
Sometimes
I
wonder
if
he
ever
looked
"Did
I
just
father
the
most
insignificant
Well,
if
you
could
get
me
the
consignment
Do
you
have
the
numbers
in
front
of
you?
MR
X:
Relax.
If
your
name
had
come
up,
We've
had
some
unexpected
losses
recently.
We'd
like
to
know
where
our
competitor
It's
clean.
Meaning?
Meaning
it's
untraceable.
Your
competitor's
very
smart.

Get
down!


Fuck
it.






No
one
leaves
the
Fraternity,
Cross.
CROSS
ON
PHONE:
MR
X:
Careful.
You
don't
destroy
something
that's
been
CROSS:
It's
already
destroyed.
I
have
to
stop
this.
-
Really?
So
why
don't
you
face
me
yourself?
Never
send
sheep
to
kill
a
wolf.
CROSS:
They
were
just
the
decoys.
Goodbye,
Mr
X.




MR
X:
Never
send
sheep
to
kill
a
wolf.
They
were
just
the
decoys.
CATHY:
Wesley!
What
is
it?
What
do
you
mean,
"What
is
it"?
Listen.

Well,
how
am
I
suppose
to
sleep
When
are
we
gonna
move
so
we
don't
I
kind
of
like
it.
WESLEY:
It
helps
to
drown
out
the
sound
Now,
please,
let
me
sleep.
Have
you
even
thought
about
our
talk?
Yes.
Which
one?
Perfect.
That's
perfect.
Feed
Annabelle.




Sorry.

Oh,
my
fucking
God.
I
hope
that's
not
my
billing
report
Holy
shit
on
an
altar,
it
is.
I
want
that
report
on
my
desk
in
one
hour.
Okay,
everybody,
WESLEY:
Want
to
hear
something
sad?
I
need
an
ergonomic
keyboard
Just
the
fact
that
I
repeat
something
enough
Nice
job,
dude.
You
seen
Barry?
He
had
to
go
to
the
dentist.
Again.
Yes!

Barry!
You
think
they
have
that
That
thing
works.
"Hey,
baby,
breakfast
in
bed."
Oh,
God.
I
lost
my
wallet
somewhere.
All
this
together?
-
No,
no.
He
is
the
man.
-
How
much
is
it?
PHARMACIST:
$20.42.

Watermelon.
Chicks
dig
it.
Thanks.
See
you
next
time.
PHARMACIST:
Have
a
good
night.
I
love
these
energy
drinks,
man.
I'm
almost,
like,
kind
of
on
where
I
do
one
for
breakfast
WESLEY:
I'm
the
man?

Yeah,
right,
Barry,
I'm
the
man.
In
fact,
I'm
so
much
the
man,
I
have
a
standing
prescription
for
God,
I
wish
I
had
something
else
Hello,
Wesley.
WESLEY:
You
know,
there
are
people,
you
just
wish
they
could
see
you
instead
of
where
you
are,

Nicole
is
so
hot.
What?
Boom
goes
the
dynamite.
WESLEY:
But
most
of
all,
for
wishing
for
things
JANICE:
Good
God
A'mighty,
you're
over
and
I
still
don't
have
that
billing
report.
Why
do
I
even
keep
you
around,
Wesley?
I'll
get
it
done,
Janice.

Like
I
never
heard
that
before.

"I'll
get
it
done.
I'll
get
it
done,
Janice.
"I'll
get
it
done."


Why
don't
you
have
anything

I'm
sorry.
Well,
you're
worthless.
I'm
the
one
who's
sorry
I
hired
your
ass.



WESLEY:
You
know
what
the
best
thing
is
Tomorrow
it
starts
all
over
again.


-
Hi.
How
you
doing?
-
I'm
sorry?
Sorry
about
that.
I
knew
your
father.
My
father
left
the
week
I
was
born,
so...
Your
father
died
yesterday
on
the
rooftop
Sorry.

Look,
the
liquor
rounds
Your
father
was
one
of
the
greatest
The
man
who
killed
him
is
behind
you.



This
guy's
just
shooting
up...
Sorry.
Sorry.


What...
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
Please!
Please!
Please
drive
faster.
-
Please
be
quiet.
Please...
Please
understand
I
don't
know
what
the
fuck
but
you're
gonna
have
to
let
me
out
Hey!
Hey!

What
are
you
doing?
Oh,
shit!
Oh,
shit!
I
think
we
lost
him.
I
think
we
lost
him.
Could
you
let
me
out
Shit!
Fuck!
Oh,
shit!
He's
right
there!
Look,
I'm
an
accountant.
Oh,
fuck!
He's
fucking
persistent,
you
know.
Fuck!

You
kick
his
ass!
Shoot
him!
What
are
you
doing?
-
Are
you
crazy?
WESLEY:
Where
are
you
going?
Get
back
in
here!
Oh,
my
God!

Oh,
damn!
I'm
sorry.
-
Gun!
FOX:
Under
the
seat!
WESLEY:
Here.



WESLEY:
Oh,
shit!

Shit!

-
WESLEY:
Look
out!
Look
out!
Oh,
my
God!
Shit!
WESLEY:
I'm
sorry!



OFFICER:
Behind
you!





Fuck.
Shit.
Shit.

Hello.
I
don't
have
any
money
or...
SLOAN:
I
thought
he'd
be
taller.
Taller?
Sir...
Sir,
I've
been
trying
to
explain
I'm
an
account
service
representative...
And
I'm
sure
that
if
you
call
she'd
fill
you
in
on
whatever
You
can
contact
her
by
email
or...
SLOAN:
Shoot
the
wings
off
the
flies.
I
don't
know
what
that
means.
Shoot
the
wings
off
the
flies.
I
really
think
you
have
me
mixed
up

On
three.
Either
you
shoot,
or
I
do.
One.
Okay.

Two.
I
can't
even
see
them!

Three.

Okay.
Okay.


That's
impossible.
SLOAN:
A
lot
of
things
for
you
What
you
experienced,
Wesley,
Your
heart
was
beating
in
excess
of
sending
abundant
amounts
of
This
allows
you
to
see
and
react
faster
Only
a
few
people
in
the
world
can
do
that.
Your
father
could
do
it
and
you
can
do
it.
With
a
little
work,
Stay
away
from
me.
Just
stay
back
from
me.
I
have
a
gun,
sir.
All
right?
My
name
is
Sloan.
This
is
Fox.
And
the
others
you
see
around
you
So,
if
I
were
you,
You
don't
wanna
point
it
at
any
of
them.
That's
better.
-
You're
insane.
Insanity
is
wasting
your
life
as
a
nothing
when
you
have
the
blood
of
a
killer
Insanity
is
being
shit
on,
beat
down,
coasting
through
life
when
you
have
a
caged
lion
locked
inside
This
gun
you're
holding
is
an
Imanishi
17.
He
could
conduct
And
you're
going
to
use
it
to
kill
the
man
-
I
can't...
Your
father
was
one
of
us.
A
fraternity
of
assassins.
We've
transferred
all
of
his
assets
And
let
me
assure
you,
they
are
substantial.
It
is
your
long-awaited
destiny
to
join
us.
Back
off.
Back
off.
You
don't
know
anything
about
me.
Stay
away
from
me.
Stay
away
from
me.
You
stay
away
from
me?
You
stay
away
from
me,
please?


WESLEY:
You
know
when
you
have
a
dream
but
it's
still
in
the
fringe
of
your
brain?
Then
you
open
your
eyes

This
was
nothing
like
that.



I'm
sorry.
Could
you
just
give
me
Oh,
shit.


Wesley.
What's
up
with
you?
What
do
you
mean?
You're...
You're
here
early.
Is...
You
seem
a
little
pepped
up.
-
You
all
right?
Yeah.
I
guess
I
feel
kind
of
different.
Whatever.
I'm
gonna
go
get
-
No.
-
Yeah.
Jesus
H.
fucking
Popsicle,
but
you've
got
time
to
sit
here
Well,
I
know
one
thing.
You've
got
your
review
and
I
can't
wait
to
start
checking
me
off
Attitude,
poor!
Performance,
poor!

Management
skills,
poor!

Works
well
with
others.

What
is
this
bullshit?
Who's
this
prick?
Some
loser
gets
his
head
blown
off
Shut
the
fuck
up!
She
has
one
single
iota
of
tenuous
power.
She
thinks
she
can
push
everyone
around.
You
don't
need
this.

I
understand.
Junior
high
must
have
been
kind
of
tough,
but
it
doesn't
give
you
the
right
to
treat
I
know
we
laugh
at
you,
Janice.
We
all
know
you
keep
your
stash
of
jelly
But
I
want
you
to
know
if
you
weren't
such
a
bitch,
I
do
feel
sorry
for
you.
But
as
it
stands,
the
way
you
behave,
I
feel
I
can
speak
for
the
entire
office
when
I
tell
you
go
fuck
yourself.

Yeah.
That
was
great,
bro.
Who's
the
man?
I'm
the
man.


That's
a
bad
idea.
Couldn't
find
your
keys,
huh?
That
could
be
handy.
I
might
need
that.
So,
Fox,
right?
What
is
that?
Is
it
like
Maverick
in
Top
Gun?
You
could
tell
me,

I'm
just
kidding.


SLOAN:
Peter!
Check
the
shuttle
rotation
on
this
STB.
This
kind
of
cotton
weave,
Hey,
this
is
pretty
awesome,
huh?
Is
it
a
front?
-
Front
for
what?
Assassinations.
You
may
think
this
is
a
front
for
something,
all
I
can
tell
you
is
this
is
a
textile
mill.
And
George...
Yeah.
This
is
a
textile
mill.
And
a
damn
good
one.
WESLEY:
Yeah,
that's
cute,
I
mean,
all
these
guys
are
killers,
I
think
you
owe
me
some
answers.
All
right.
Clearly
I
don't
understand,
but
do
you
make
sweaters

That's
an
awful
lot
of
questions
over
coffee.
Are
you
sure
you're
ready
for
the
answers?
Yes,
I'm
sure.
I
can't
go
back.
Not
to
my
life.
SLOAN:
He's
all
yours.
All
right.
We're
up.
REPAIRMAN:
How
you
doing?
I'm
The
Repairman.
What
do
you
repair?
A
lifetime
of
bad
habits.
-
Okay.
Just
put
your
arms
behind
your
back.
-
It's
okay.
-
Just
behind
your
back.
REPAIRMAN:
Just
relax.
WESLEY:
Is
this
part
of
it?
REPAIRMAN:
There
we
go.
-
You
going
to
put
a
bag
over
my
head?
-
That's
not
too
tight,
is
it?
Why
did
you
come
here,
Wesley?
Well,
you
brought
me
here,
remember?

What
the
fuck
did
you
do
that...


How
many
punches
before
he
was
counting
sheep?
Well,
I
haven't
spent
a
lot
of
time
-
Did
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
knives?
WESLEY:
Fuck.
It
was
a
rhetorical
question,
culo.
You
interrupt
me
again,
Here's
what
you
need
to
know,
puto.
Knives
are
easy
to
hide.
They
don't
jam
and
they
never

They
come
in
handy
when
you
have
to
do
some
What
the
fuck,
man?
-
Come
here.
Come
here.
BUTCHER:
Now,
try
to
cut
me.
Try
to
cut
me.
Hey!
-
Just
stick
me
with
that...
-
Just
stick
and
stick
and
stick.
-
Seriously,
man,
I
could
hurt
you.
Okay,
pussy.
-
I'm
not
a
pussy.
-
No,
I'm
not
a
pussy.
I'm
not
a
pussy.
I
got
a
healthy
respect
-
Fuck
that,
you
pussy!
-
You're
a
pussy!
-
Come
on,
pussy.



Hi.
How
you
doing?
What
the
fuck?
The
fuck!

Just
a
moment.
Just
a
moment.
Sorry.
WESLEY:
Hello?
Hey!
Hey,
come
back!
Hey!
You
must
drink.
Drink.
Yeah.

-
What
is
this?
This
bath
stimulates
white
blood
cells
In
here,
bruises,
cuts,
breaks
You
shitting
me?
-
What
is
that?
Vodka?
-
Are
you
Russian?
Get
up.
This
is
The
Gunsmith.
He
knows
more
about
a
piece
than
anybody,
-
How
you
doing?
-
You
know
that
Seltzer
broke
his
leg?
GUNSMITH:
Yeah,
in
three
places.
FOX:
How'd
he
do
that?
FOX:
So,
is
he
okay?
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God,
you
guys,
that
is
so
realistic.
He's
been
in
recovery
for,
like,
and
they
say
they're
not
even
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God!
Hey,
we
can't
shoot
a
dead
woman!

You
need
to
know
what
it's
like
FOX:
Why
are
you
here?
You
know,
I
thought
I
was
learning
to
be
You
know,
if
I
wanted
to
get
beat
up,
I
would
have
stayed
in
my
cubicle,
Fuck.
FOX:
All
right,
shoot
the
target.
From
there.
-
You
want
me
shoot
through
Wilbur?
How
am
I
suppose
to
do
that?
It's
not
a
question
of
how,
it's
a
question
of
what.
If
no
one
told
you
that
bullets
flew
straight
and
I
gave
you
a
gun
what
would
you
do?
Let
your
instincts
guide
you.
WESLEY:
How
the
hell
did
he
do
that?
Can
you
do
that?
Can
you
do
that?
Hello?
Hey,
I
think
that's
my
old
train.
FOX:
Still
is.

Shit!
You
fucking
asshole!
Come
on!
Let's
go.
Are
you
out
of
your
fucking
mind?
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.

Oh,
God,
I
feel...
I
feel...
I
feel...
I
feel
kind
of
good.
GUNSMITH:
He
got
Rictus.
Cross
is
taking
us
out
one
by
one.
And
Wesley
is
the
only
one
Cross
gets
closer
with
each
hour.
Get
back
to
work.
FOX:
See
that?
-
It's
a
shuttle.
I
want
you
to
try
and
catch
it.
You
want
me
to
stick
my
hand
in
there?
Yes.
I
want
you
to
catch
it.


You
wanna
put
a
gun
to
my
head?
I
can
just
slow
things
down
You
need
to
learn

Fuck,
fuck,
fuck!
This
is
bullshit!
Fuck
this!
SLOAN:
How's
it
going
today,
Wesley?
No.
Fuck
the
loom
and
fuck
The
Repairman!
I
can
shoot
the
wings
off
the
back
of
a
fly!
You're
ready
when
Fox
says
you're
ready.
-
Who
put
her
in
charge?

Wesley.

People
think
you
use
cheese
But
they
go
apeshit
for
peanut
butter.
Your
father
was
a
big
fan
of
this.
Watch.

Plastic
explosive
and
peanut
butter!
Sorry,
Mickey.
Five,
four,
three,
two,
one.
Hey.
Hey,
Russian.
Good
for
one.
Yeah.
Imagine
if
you
had
a
thousand.
They
really
fucked
you
up,
didn't
they?
What
the
hell
did
they
do
to
you?

Throw
you
in
front
of
a
moving
train
Beat
the
shit
out
of
you?
You
know,
you
can
say
it,
Bullshit!

Repairman.
Five
minutes.
Heads
up
out
of
the
question?
Fuck.
You're
a
waste
of
my
fucking
time!
I
don't
know,
so
hit
me.
-
Why
are
you
here?
I
wanna
kick
your
fucking
ass!
Tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
say.
-
FOX:
Why
are
you
here?
FOX:
Why
are
you
here?
-
Why
are
you
here?
FOX:
Why
are
you
here?
Why
are
you
here?
I
don't
know
who
I
am.
-
What
did
you
say?
I
said
I
don't
know
who
I
am.
Do
you
really
want
to
know
who
you
are?
Yeah.
It's
my
room.
No.
This
was
your
father's
room.
WESLEY:
What
happened?
SLOAN:
A
member
WESLEY:
Cross.
He
started
by
killing
Your
father.
Blindsided
him
on
a
rooftop.
Betrayed
him.
Everything
in
this
room,
books,
weapons,
clothes,
belonged
to
him.
Now
they
belong
to
you.
Find
a
connection
in
this
room,
Wesley.
It
may
be
the
only
way
WESLEY:
Now
I
know
why
I
could
never
care
I
was
living
a
lie.
Finally,
I
have
a
chance
to
step
Grow
a
pair.
Live
the
life
I
was
born
to
live.
I've
been
pissing
it
all

have
to
train
harder.
I
have
to
be
as
good
as
my
father.
On
these

the

His
bullets
untraceable,
of
course.
Or
how
no
matter
what
the
weapon
he
was
always

chess
move
ahead.
One
move
more
prepared.
One
step
quicker.
One
shot
more
precise.
In
fact,
in
all
my
research,
Not
until
me.
