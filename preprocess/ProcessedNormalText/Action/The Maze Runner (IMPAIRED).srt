Hello?

Hello?



Hey!
Hey!
Help
me!





Go
get
him.
Day
one,
Greenie.
Rise
and
shine.

He
looks
like
a
slopper
to
me.

I
could
use
some


Hey,
we
got
a
runner!


BOYS:
Oh!


BOY
1:
Take
it
all
in.




BOY:
He's
all
yours.
Hey.

Hey
there,
Green
Bean.
You're
not
gonna
Good.


My
name
is
Alby.
Can
you
tell
me
anything
Who
you
are?
Where
you
came
from?
No.
Can
you
tell
me
your
name?
I,
uh,
I
can't
remember
anything.
Why
can't
I
remember
anything?
It's
okay.

Hey,
relax.
Relax.
It's
normal.

It
happens
to
us
all.
You'll
get
your
name
It's
the
one
thing
What
is
this
place?
Let
me
show
you.

ALBY:
We
eat
here.
We
sleep
here.
We
grow
our
own
food.
We
build
our
own
shelter.
Whatever
we
need,
The
rest
is
up
to
us.
The
Box?
Yeah.
It's
sent
up
with
fresh
supplies
This
month
that's
you.
Congratulations.
Sent
up?
By
who,
though?
That,
we
don't
know.
Hey,
are
you
all
right,
Alby?
Green
Bean,
meet
Newt.
When
I'm
not
around,
Well,
it's
a
good
thing
That
was
some
dash
For
a
second,
I
thought
you
had
...till
you
face-planted.
That
was
great.
Wait,
a
"runner"?
Newt,
do
me
a
favor.
All
right.
Look,
I'm
sorry
to
rush
this.
You
came
up
a
little
late,
We
got
something
special
Yeah.
You'll
see.
I
hope
you're
not
Let's
go.
Come
on.
This
is
all
we
got.
We've
worked
hard
for
it.
If
you
respect
this
place...
you
and
I
will
What's
out
there?
We
only
have
three
rules.
First,
do
your
part.
No
time
for
any
freeloaders.
Second,
never
None
of
this
works
Most
importantly...
never
go
beyond
those
walls.
Do
you
understand
me,
Greenie?
CHUCK:
Hey,
Alby!
Hey,
Chuck.
It's
basically
the
same
We
wake
up
in
the
Box,
then
here
we
are.
Don't
worry.
You're
already
I
clunked
my
pants
three
times
before
they
got
No,
come
on.
Dude,
where
are
you
going?
I
just
wanna
see.
You
can
look
around
all
you
want
but
you
better
not
go
out
there.
Why
not?
I
don't
know.
I
just
And
we're
not
supposed
to
leave.

BEN:
Hey,
Chuck.
How
does
it
feel
to
be
promoted?
Feels
great,
Ben.
I
thought
no
one
I
said
we're
not
They're
different,
They
know
more
about
Wait,
what?
What?
What?
You
just
I
did?
Yeah.
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
just
gonna
take
a
look.
I
told
you,
you
can't.
No
one
leaves,
It's
not
safe.
Okay,
all
right,
Hey!

We
gotta
stop
meeting
Get
off
me!
All
right!
BOY:
Don't
touch
me!
GALLY:
Whoa!
Take
it
easy!
Just
relax.
What
the
hell
is
Just
calm
down,
all
right?
No,
okay?
Why
won't
you
We're
just
trying
to
protect
you.
You
guys
can't
I
can't
let
you
leave.




What
the
hell?

Next
time,
I'm
gonna
Welcome
to
the
Glade.

Light
him
up!




Hell
of
a
first
day,
Greenie.
Here.
Put
some
hair
on
your
chest.

Oh!

Oh,
my
God!

I
don't
even
know.
It's
Gally's
recipe.
It's
a
trade
secret.

Yeah,
well,
He
saved
your
life
today.
Trust
me.
The
maze
We're
trapped
here,
aren't
we?
For
the
moment.
But...
you
see
those
guys?
There,
by
the
fire?
Those
are
the
runners.
That
guy
in
the
middle
He's
the
Keeper
of
the
Runners.
Every
morning,
when
those
doors
mapping
it,
memorizing
it,
trying
to
find
a
way
out.
How
long
have
they
been
looking?
Three
years.
And
they
haven't
found
anything?
It's
a
lot
Listen.

Hear
that?
It's
the
maze,
changing.
It
changes
every
night.
How
is
that
even
possible?
You
can
ask
the
people
if
you
ever
meet
the
bastards.
Listen,
the
truth
is...
the
runners
are
the
only
ones
who
really
know
They
are
the
strongest
and
And
it's
a
good
thing,
too...
because
if
they
don't
make
it
then
they
are
stuck
out
And
no
one
has
ever
survived
What
happens
to
them?
Well,
we
call
them
Grievers.
Of
course,
no
one's
and
lived
to
tell
about
it.
But
they're
out
there.
Right,
that's
enough
Come
on.
You're
supposed
to
Oh,
no...
Let
me
show
you
around.
Come
on.

ALL:

And
there
we
got
the
builders.
They're
very
good
but
not
a
lot
going
on
upstairs.
And
then
we
got
Winston...
he's
the
Keeper
of
the
Slicers.
And
we
got
two
med-jacks,
Hey,
what's
up?
They
spend
most
of
their
time
What
if
I
want
to
be
a
runner?

Have
you
listened
to
No
one
wants
to
be
a
runner.
And,
besides,
Chosen
by
who?

What
do
you
say,
Greenie?
Wanna
see
what
you're
made
of?



Okay.
All
right.
The
rules
are
simple,
Greenie.
I
try
to
push
you
you
try
to
last
more
than
five
seconds.
BOY
1:
Take
it
easy
on
the
Greenie.


BOY
2:
Get
up,
boy.
Come
on,
Greenie.
Stop
calling
me
Greenie.
GALLY:
Stop
calling
you
that?
What
do
you
wanna

What
do
you
think,
boys?
Does
he
look
like
a
Shank?

BOYS:
Whoa!
BOY
3:
Come
on!
You
know
what?
I
think

BOYS:
Oh!
There
you
go,
Greenie!
Not
bad
for
a
Greenie,
huh?
Oh!


Thomas.
Thomas.
Hey!
Thomas!

I
remember
my
name.
ALL:
Thomas!

Welcome
home,
Thomas.

Good
job...
Thomas.

What
the
hell
was
that?
That,
my
friend,
was
a
Griever.
Don't
worry,
you're
Nothing
gets
All
right,
guys.
Let's
tuck
it
in
for
It
was
a
good
night.
Good
job,
man.
GALLY:
You're
safe
here
with
us.
WOMAN:
Wicked
is
good.
THOMAS:
What's
out
there?
GIRL:
Thomas,
Thomas.
Can
you
hear
me?
Everything
is
going
to
change.
ALBY:
Thomas.
Shh.
Follow
me.
ALBY:
It's
peaceful,
isn't
it?
I
know
it's
hard
to
believe,
We
had
dark
days.
We
lost
a
lot
of
boys
to
fear.
To
panic.
We've
come
far
since
then.
Established
order...
made
peace.
Yeah.
Why
are
Because
you're
not
You're
curious.
But
you're
one
of
us
now.
You
need
to
know
What
happened
to
them?
Like
I
said...
dark
days,
Thomas.
Has
anyone
tried
Tried
it.
The
ivy
doesn't
And
besides,
where
are
And
what
about
the
Box?
You
know,
next
No,
we
tried
that.
The
Box
won't
go
back
Okay,
what
if
we...
No,
we
tried
it,
all
right?
Twice.
All
right?
Trust
me.
Anything
you
The
only
way
out
of
here
Now,
look,
you
wanna
be
helpful?
Here.
Go
dig
us
up
"Just
get
the
fertilizer,
"Are
you
sure,
guys?
I
can't
"No,
just
get
"You
know
where
it
is.
It's
just


Oh!

Uh...
You're
Ben,
right?
I
don't
know
if
we
Are
you
okay?

Get
the
hell
off
me!
It's
your
fault.
I
saw
you.
You
did
this.
I
saw
you!




Hey!
Hey!
THOMAS:
Hey!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
I'll
kill
you!


Hold
him
down.
What
are
you
doing?
Calm
down,
Ben.
What
the
hell
happened?
He
just
attacked
me!
Are
you
okay?

GALLY:
Calm
down,
Ben.
No.
No.
All
right,
lift
his
shirt.
Lift
his
shirt.
No!
No!

He's
been
stung.
In
the
middle
of
the
day?
Help
me,
please.

Please.
Please,
just
help.

Put
him
in
the
pit.
GALLY:
Everybody,
help.
No!
Please
don't
do
it!
Calm
down,
Ben.
Back
down,
Ben.
Listen
to
me!
Please!

Please,
stop,
please!
He
did
this!
Please
stop!
No!
THOMAS:
So
what
happened
to
him?
It's
called
It's
what
happens
Listen.
We
haven't
been
able
out
of
Ben
since
it
happened.
He's
not
making
any
sense.
And
it's
only
gonna
get
worse.
The
infection
is
spreading.
He's
dangerous.
What
did
he
say
to
you?
He
said
he
saw
me...
and
that
this
was
all
my
fault.
How
could
this
be
my
fault?
Get
some
rest.
Alby?
What's
gonna
happen
to
him?

Just
listen
to
me.
Please,
Minho!

Alby!




No,
please.
Please,
don't
do
it.




Poles!

Move
in!
No,
no,
no!
Please!
No,
please!
I
can
get
better!
Please,
stop,
please!
ALBY:
Push
him
in!

I'll
get
better!




He
belongs
to
the
maze
now.
THOMAS:
Do
you
think
he
might
make
it?
Ben?
No.
No
one
survives
We
just
gotta
forget
about
him.
GIRL:
Thomas.
WOMAN:
Wicked
is
good.
Don't
make
it
easy
on
them.
GIRL:
Thomas.
Everything
is
going
to
change.
THOMAS:
Wicked
is
good.
MALE
SCIENTIST:
This
is
gonna
hurt
a
little.
WOMAN:
Wicked
is
good.
Thomas,
you
have
to
choose.

THOMAS:
But
why
would
I
mean,
he's
not
a
runner.
NEWT:
Things
Alby
went
to
retrace
Ben's
Are
you
gonna
help?
So
he's
gonna
go
back
to
Alby
knows
what
he's
doing...
all
right?
He
knows
better
than
any
of
us.
What
does
that
mean?
Well,
it's
like
Every
month,
the
Box
But
someone
had
Someone
had
to
have
spent
a
whole
That
was
Alby.
I
mean,
it
can't
have
been
easy.
But
when
those
coming
up,
he
saw
the
truth.
And
he
learned
that
the
is
that
we
all
have
each
other.
Because
we're
all
Yeah.
There
you
go,
Greenie.

THOMAS:
They
should
be
back
by
now.
What
happens
if
They're
gonna
make
it.
What
happens
if
they
don't?
They're
gonna
make
it.
Come
on,
guys,
can't
we
GALLY:
That's
against
the
rules.
Either
they
make
it
We
can't
risk

Oh,
no.

There!

Wait,
something's
wrong.

Come
on,
Minho,
you
can
do
it!
ALL:
Come
on!
Go!
CHUCK:
Come
on,
Minho,
you
gotta
leave
him!
They're
not
gonna
make
it.

You


CHUCK:
Thomas,
no!



Good
job.
You
just
killed
yourself.
What?

What
happened
to
him?
What
does
it
look
like?
He
got
stung.
What
happened
to
his
head?
I
did
what
I
had
to
do.


Okay.
Okay,
We
gotta
go.
The
maze
Hey,
Minho!
We
can't
just
leave
him
here.
THOMAS:
We
gotta
get
him
up.

Come
on.
Just
sit
him
down.

This
isn't
going
to
work.
We
gotta
go!
Wait,
what
are
you
talking
about?
Where?
Are
you
telling
me
there's
not
a

Listen
to
me,
Take
a
look
around.

You
don't
get
it.
We're
already
dead.

Two,
three...

Two,
three...
Okay.

What
are
you
doing?
What
are
you
doing?
We
gotta
go.
No,
no,
just
a
little
more

Minho,
stay
with
me.
Stay
with
me,
Minho.
Just
a
little
more,
I'm
sorry,
Greenie.
Minho!






Okay.

Come
on.





Whoa!


Oh!
Oh,
shit!

Whoa!

Whoa!






You're
a
crazy
son
of
a
bitch.
Come
on,
follow
me.


Okay,
it's
changing.
This
section
is
closing.
We
can
lose
it
down
here!
Thomas!
What
are
you
waiting
for?

Come
on!
Come
on!
Come
on,
Thomas!
Run!
Move
it,
Thomas!
Go
on!
Move
your
ass!
Come
on,
Greenie!
Thomas!
Guys,
get
up!
I
told
you,
Chuck.
They're
not
coming
back.
BOY:
Let's
go.
No
way.
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!

I
got
him,
I
got
him,
I
got
him.
Watch
out.
Easy.
What
happened
out
there?
You
saw
a
Griever?
Yeah,
I
saw
one.
He
didn't
just
see
it.
He
killed
it.

Things
are
changing.

There's
no
denying
that.
First,
Ben
gets
And
then
Alby.
And
now
our
Greenie,
here,
to
go
into
the
maze.
Which
is
a
clear
violation
Yeah...
Did
he?
For
3
years,
we
have
And
now,
you've
killed
Who
knows
what
that
What
do
you
suggest
we
do?
He
has
to
be
punished.

Come
on.
Minho.
You
were
there
with
him.
I
think...
in
all
the
time
no
one
has
ever
When
I
turned
tail
and
ran...
this
dumb
shank
stayed
Look,
I
don't
know
But
whatever
it
is,
I
say
we
make
him
a
runner.
FRY:
A
runner?
What?
Minho,
let's
not
Thomas!
Thomas!
Thomas!
If
you
want
to
throw
the
Go
ahead.
But
if
there
is
one
thing
it
is
that
you
do
not...

Okay,
wait.
The
Box.
It
shouldn't
be.

FRY:
Newt,
what
do
you
see?
BOY
1:
Do
you
see
it?
It's
a
girl.

BOY
2:
No
way.
NEWT:
I
think
she's
dead.
What's
in
her
hand?
"She's
the
What
the
hell
does
that
mean?

ALL:
Whoa!

Thomas...
Do
you
still
think

NEWT:
Jeff,
what's
going
on?
What's
the
matter
with
her?
Hey
man,
I
got
my
job
Do
you
recognize
her?
No.
Really?
Because
she
What
about
the
note?
We'll
worry
I
think
you
should
We've
got
enough
to
He's
right,
Newt.
If
the
Box
isn't
coming
back
up,
how
long
do
you
No
one
said
that.
Let's
not
jump
We'll
just
wait
until
she
wakes
Somebody
has
gotta
have
Okay.
Where
are
you
going?
Hey.
Hey,
Thomas.
What
is
this
with
you,
huh?
You
just
got
out
and

Newt
said
that
no
one
and
lived
to
tell
Minho,
now
we
have
one.
You're
telling
me
you're
not
Not
really,
no.
So,
what's
the
plan?
You're
gonna
go
out
and
dissect
I
will
if
I
have
to.
Have
the
other
runners
left
yet?
The
other
runners

After
Alby
in
any
hurry
to
Why
are
you?
I
think
it's
time
we
find
out
All
right.
But
you're
not
going
Meet
me
in
the
woods

Will
this
be
enough?
Okay.
Let's
go.
Come
on!
That's
disgusting.
There's
something
in
there.
You
mean,
besides
Whoa,
what
are
you
doing?
ALL:
Whoa!
I
thought
you
said
it
was
dead.
Was
it
a
reflex?
You
hope.
Okay,
come
on.
Let's
Everyone
get
a
hand
on
it.
All
right,
ready?
One,
two,
three!


Are
you
okay,
Fry?

What
the
hell
is
that?
Interesting.
FRY:
Okay,
whatever
it
is...
can
we
take
this
up
Because
I
don't
want
to
He's
right.
It's
getting
late.
THOMAS:
We
found
this.
It
was
inside
a
Griever.
These
are
the
same
letters
we
Whoever
put
us
here
obviously
This
is
the
first
real
clue,
the
first
anything,
you've
Right,
Minho?
Right.
THOMAS:
Newt,
we
gotta
Who
knows
where
You
see
what
he's
First
he
breaks
our
rules...
and
then
he
tries
to
convince
The
rules
are
the
only
thing
Why
now
are
we
questioning
that?
If
Alby
was
here,
you
This
shank
needs
to
be
punished.
You're
right.
Thomas
broke
the
rules.
One
night
in
the
pit,
Come
on,
Newt!
Do
you
think
that's
gonna
stop
No.
And
we
can't
just
running
into
the
maze
So
let's
just
Starting
from
tomorrow,
Wow.
Gally...
Thanks,
Newt.
Hey,
where
are
we
going?
You'll
see.

It's
the
maze.
All
of
it.
What
do
you
mean
"all
of
it"?
I
There's
nothing
left
to
map.
I've
run
every
Every
cycle.
Every
pattern.
If
there
was
a
way
out,
we
would
have
found
it
by
now.
Why
haven't
you
It
was
Alby's
call.
People
needed
to
believe
we
But
maybe
now...
we
have
a
real
chance.

Take
a
look
at
this.
About
a
year
ago,
we
started
We
found
these
numbers
Sections
1
through
8.
See,
the
way
it
works,
is
every
night,
it
opens
up
a
new
section.
So
today,
Section
6
was
open.
Tomorrow,
it
will
be
4,
The
pattern
What's
so
special
about
7?
I
don't
know.
But
last
night,
when
you
Section
7
was
open.
I
think
it
must
be
Tomorrow,
you
and
I
are
Hey!
What
are
you
guys
doing?

Sorry,
It's
the
girl.
Is
she
awake?
You
could
say
that.
Chuck,
what's
going
on?
Girls
are
awesome.
GIRL:
Leave
me
alone!
FRY:
Watch
your
head!
Hey,
throw
one
more
Go
away!
What
happened?
I
don't
think
she
GIRL:
What
do
you
want
from
me?
I'm
warning
you!
Take
cover,
y'all!

Hey,
it's
Thomas!
I'm
gonna
come
up,
okay?
Okay.
Just
me.
I'm
coming
up.

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Okay,
just...
Easy,
all
right?
Where
am
I?
What
is
this
place?
Why
can't
I
remember
anything?
This
is
all
normal.
Okay?
Okay?
Your
name
will
come
back
to
It's
the
one
thing
that...
What
did
you
say?
My
name.
It's
Teresa.
Teresa,
I'm
Thomas.
But
you
already
knew
that,
They
said
I
kept
saying
Who
are
you?
I
don't
know.

I
can't
remember.
None
of
us
here
can
We
all
woke
up
here
Hey,
I
promise...
I'm
gonna
take
this.
Okay.

GALLY:
What's
going
on
up
there?
Is
she
coming
down?
Um...
Hey,
listen,
you
guys
just
All
right.
Come
on.
Is
this
what
all
girls
are
like?
ZART:
That
girl
is
crazy.
"She's
the
last
one."
I'm
not
sure.
Ever
since
you
came
up,
that
Box
hasn't
gone
back
down.
I
just
think
it's
got
Especially
Gally.
He
thinks
it's
my
fault.
Are
you
sure
you
don't
I
remember
water...
feeling
like
I
was
drowning.
These
faces
staring
at
me.
And
this
woman's
voice
saying
"Wicked
is
good."
Ever
since
I've
been
here,
Well,
I
thought
You...
You
were
there.
You
were
there...
and
you
told
me
that
What
does
it
mean?
I
don't
know.
And
the
others
don't
No.
Why
are
we
different?
These
were
in
my
"W.C.K.D."
"Wicked
is
good."
What
if
we
were
Alby.

NEWT:
We
don't
even
We
don't
know
who
sent
it.
Or
why
it
came
up
here
with
you.
For
all
we
know,
this
He's
already
dying.
Look
at
him.
How
could
this
possibly

Come
on,
it's
worth
a
try.
All
right.
Do
it.
Okay.

You
shouldn't
be
here!
No!
Watch
out!

Get
the
syringe!
Let
go!

Well,
that
worked.
Okay,
from
now
on...
someone
stays
here
and
watches
Hey.
Sundown,
Greenie.
Hey,
what
is
your
Everything
started
going
wrong
First
Ben,
then
Alby...
and
now
the
girl.
Everybody
saw
And
I'm
betting

Gally...
you
know
we
can't
stay

Who's
there?
It's
just
me.
Sorry,
Chuck.
Here.
You'll
run
better
Mmm...
Thanks,
Chuck.
Hey,
what
do
you
got
there?
Wow,
that
came
out
What's
that
for?
It's
for
my
parents.
You
remember
your
parents?
No.
I
mean,
I
know
I
must
have
them.

And
wherever
they
are,
but
I
can't
miss
them
because
What
do
you
think
you're
gonna
Uh,
I
don't
know.
But
if
there's
a
way
out,
Chuck,
me
and
Minho
are
gonna
find
it.

Here.
Chuck,
why
would
I
can't
remember
them
anyway.
But
maybe
if
you
find
a
way
out,
you
can
give
it
to
them
for
me.
I'll
let
you
get
some
sleep.
Hey,
Chuck.
Come
here.
Put
out
your
hand.
I
want
you
to
give
We're
gonna
get
out
of
here.
All
of
us.
Okay?
I
promise.
Yeah.
Good
night.

Big
day,
Greenie.
Are
you
sure
you
don't
Come
on,
man.
Get
me
out
of
here.

Let's
go!

This
way.
Not
much
further
Let's
go!
Come
on!
This
way.

MINHO:
That's
strange.
THOMAS:
What?
Seven
is
not
supposed
to
THOMAS:
What
the
MINHO:
We
call
them
blades.
It's
Ben's,
isn't
it?
Yeah.
A
Griever
must
have

Whoa,
hey!


I
think
it's
showing
us
the
way.
Wait,
wait,
wait.

This
way.
Come
on.

Minho,
you
ever
see
No.


It's
just
another
dead
end.

Are
you
sure
about
this?
Nope.
Grievers.


What
the
hell
was
that?

We
gotta
get
out
of
here.
Give
me
the
key,

Move,
move!

We
gotta
go!
We're
gonna
get
trapped!
Go!
Go!

MINHO:
Go,
go,
go!
Move!


Minho!
MINHO:
Come
on!

Come
on,
move!
Keep
going!
BOTH:
Whoa!
Go,

Oh!
Go,

BOTH:
Whoa!
Come
on!
Come
on!

Oh,
shit!
There!


Oh!
NEWT:
What
the
hell's
What
the
hell
you
We
found
something,
We
think
it
could
be
a
way
out.
Really?
We
opened
a
door,
something
I
think
it
must
be
where
the
Wait!
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa...
You're
saying
you
found
And
you
want
us
to
go
in?
Their
way
in
could
Yeah,
or
there
could
be
a
dozen
The
truth
is,
Thomas
doesn't
Yeah,
at
least
I
did
I
mean,
what
have
you
done?
Aside
from
hide
behind
Let
me
tell
you
You've
been
here
3
days,
all
right?
Yeah,
you've
been
here
3
years
What
does
that
tell
you?
Maybe
you
should
start
doing
Maybe
you
should
be
in
Hey,
it's
Alby!
He's
awake.
Has
he
said
anything?
No.
Alby...
Alby,
are
you
all
right?
Hey,
Alby.
Alby,
we
might
have
just
Do
you
hear
me?
We
could
We
can't.
We
can't
leave.
They
won't
let
us.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
remember.
What
do
you
remember?
You.
You
were
always
Always.

Why
did
you
do
this?
Why
did
you
come
here?


Winston,
what's
going
on?
It's
the
doors.



Chuck,
go
to
the
Council
Hall
and
start
barricading
the
doors.
Winston,
you
go
with
him.
Get
the
others.
Tell
them

Minho,
I
want
you
to

All

Ahh!

ZART:
Help

Go,

Stay

Gally!
Let
me
in,

THOMAS:
Alby!
What's
going
on?
They're
here.

Thomas,
what
do
we
do?
It's
got
me!

Everybody,
run,
run,
run!
Jeff,
come
on,
go,
go,
go!



Everyone,

Keep
moving!
Ahh!
JEFF:
Alby!
Get
behind
me!
Come
on!
FRY:
Over
here,
let's
go!
Over
here!
Over
here,
come
on!
Winston!
Get
Alby
inside.
Chuck,
get
in!
Go,

Lock
down
the
doors!


TERESA:
Careful.
ALL:
Whoa!
NEWT:
Stay
back,
guys.






NEWT:
Is
everyone
all
right?
BOY:
Help!
Hey,
grab
him!

Watch
out!


JEFF:
Chuck!

Chuck,
no!
Pull
him
back!

CHUCK:
Help!
No
shit!
TERESA:
Pull!




Chuck,
are
you
okay?
Thanks,
Alby.
Alby!
Watch
Out!

NEWT:
Grab
him!

Thomas,
get
them
out.

Alby!
No!
Thomas!
MINHO:
No,
Thomas,
wait!
Thomas,
wait!


BOY:
Where
is
everybody?
Who's
that
over
there?
Gally...

This
is
all
you,
Thomas!
MINHO:
Back
off,
Gally!
GALLY:
You
heard
He's
one
of
them!
He's
one
of
them,
to
destroy
everything,
Look
around,
Thomas!
This
is
your
fault!
MINHO:
Back
off,
Gally!
NEWT:
What
are
you
talking
about?
GALLY:
They
sent
him
here,
and
now
he's
destroyed
NEWT:
What
are
you

Maybe
he's
right.
Thomas...
THOMAS:
I
need
Thomas...
Thomas!

Thomas!
Chuck,
get
the
other
syringe!
It's
okay.
Thomas,
I'm
here.
THOMAS:
Who
put
us
here?
ALBY:
That
we
don't
know.
THOMAS:
Teresa...
why
are
we
doing
this?
WOMAN:
Excellent,
Thomas.
Come
with
me.
Wicked
isn't
good.
Wicked
is
good.
THOMAS:
How
could
BEN:
You
did
this!
I
saw
you!
THOMAS:
I
can't
keep
TERESA:
Hey.
Are
you
okay?
What
the
hell
were
you
thinking?
What
happened?
NEWT:
Gally
He
said
we
had
a
choice.
or
get
banished

And
the
others
Gally
has
everyone
you're
the
reason
Well,
he's
been
right
so
far.
What
are
you
talking
about?
This
place...
it's
not
what
we
thought
it
was.
It's
not
a
prison,
it's
a
test.
It
all
started
They
would
give
us
They
were
experimenting
on
us.
And
then
people
Every
month,
one
after
the
They
were
sending
Yeah,
but
not
all
of
us.
What
do
you
mean?
Guys,
I'm
one
of
them.
The
people
who
put
you
I
watched
you
guys
for
years.
The
entire
time
I
was
on
the
other
side
of
it.
So
were
you.
What?
Teresa,
we
did
this
to
them.
No.
That
can't
be
true.
THOMAS:
It
is.
I
saw
it.
Why
would
they
send
us
It
doesn't
matter.
NEWT:
He's
right.
It
doesn't
matter.
Any
of
it.
Because
the
people
we
were
before
These
Creators
But
what
does
matter
is
who
right
now.
You
went
into
the
maze
Yeah,
but
if
I
hadn't,
Maybe.
But
I
know
that
if
he
were
here,
he
would
be
telling
you
Pick
your
ass
up
Because
if
we
do
nothing...
then
that
means
Alby
died
for
Okay.
Okay,
but
we
gotta
This
is
such
a
waste.
Gally...
It
doesn't
feel
right,
man.
JEFF:
Yeah,
what
if
Maybe
he
can
lead
us
home.
We
are
home.
Okay?
I
don't
wanna
have
to
cross
You
really
think
banishing
us
is
gonna
solve
anything?
No.
But
this
isn't
a
banishing.
It's
an
offering.
What?
Wait!
Gally,
what
are
you
doing?
You
really
think
back
into
the
maze
Look
around
you!
Look
at
our
Glade!
This
is
the
only
way.
And
when
the
Grievers
get
everything
goes
back
Are
you
listening
to
this?
Why
are
you
all
just
standing
there?
You
shut
up.
the
Grievers
are
They're
gonna
come
back,
and
until
you're
all
dead!
Shut
up!
Tie
him
up!
Do
you
hear
me?

You're
full
of
surprises,
You
don't
have
to
come
with
Anyone
else
who
wants
to
come,
Don't
listen
to
him,
he's
No,
I'm
not
trying
to
scare
you.
I'm
scared.
But
I'd
rather
risk
than
spending
the
rest
We
don't
belong
here.
This
place
isn't
our
home.
We
were
put
here.
We
were
trapped
here.
At
least,
out
there
We
can
make
it
out
of
here.
I
know
that.
I'm
sorry.
THOMAS:
Gally,
it's
over.
Just
come
with
us.
Good
luck
against
the
Grievers.
THOMAS:
Everybody,
Keep
it
up,
guys,

Is
it
a
Griever?
Shit.
You
take
this,
Chuck.
It's
okay.
Just
stick
with
me.
Once
we're
through,
and
the
door
will
open.
We
stay
close,
we
get
through
this.
or
we
die
trying.
Ready?
All
right.
Let's
go!



MINHO:
Get
up,
look
out!
Push
it!
Look
out!


The
key!
Chuck!
Watch
the
edge!


Oh,
no.
I
got
you,
Chuck!


TERESA:
Come
on!
Thomas!
Thomas!
Chuck?
We
got
more
coming!
Keep
it
steady,
guys!

It
works!

Teresa,
go!
THOMAS:
Don't
back
down!
Keep
pushing!

There's
gotta
be

THOMAS:
Watch
it!


TERESA:
It
won't
open!
Thomas!
Eight
numbers!
Eight
sections
of
the
maze.
Hey,
Minho!
What's
the
sequence?
The
sections
of
the
maze,
Seven!
One!
Five!
Two!
Six!
Four!


THOMAS:
Minho!

Get
off
of
me!



Jeff!

What's
the
sequence?
Six!
Four!
Eight!
Three!
You
got
it?
THOMAS:
Keep
holding!
Almost
there,
come
on!
BOY:
The
door
opened!





Seriously?
WINSTON:
What
happened
here?
So
they
were
watching
us.
This
whole
time.
Hello.
My

is
Doctor

I'm

could
be
there
in

I'm
sure
by
now,
you
must
angry...
frightened.
I
can
only
assure
you,
that
everything
we've
done
to
you...
it
was
all
done
for
a
reason.
You
won't
remember...
but
the
Sun
has
Billions
of
lives
famine...
suffering
on
a
global
scale.
The
fallout
was
unimaginable.
What
came
after
was
worse.
We
called
it
the
Flare.
A
deadly
virus
that
It
is
violent...
unpredictable...
incurable.
Or
so
we
thought.
In
time,
a
new
that
could
survive
the
virus.
Suddenly,
there
was

The
young

have
to
be
inside
harsh
environments...
where
their

All
in
an
effort
to
understand...
what
makes
them
different...
what
makes
you
different.
You
may
not
realize
it...
but
you're
very
important.
Unfortunately,
your

As
you

no
doubt
not
everyone
agrees
Progress
is
slow,
It
may
be
too
late
for
us...
for
me...
but
not
for
you.
The
outside
world
awaits.
Remember...
Wicked
is
good.


Is
it
over?
She
said
we
were
important.
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
now?
I
don't
know.
Let's
get
out
of
here.
GALLY:
No.
Gally?
He's
been
stung.

We
can't
leave.
We
did.
We're
free.
Free?
You
think
we're
free
out
there?
No.
No,
there's
no
escape
Gally,
listen
to
me.
You're
not
thinking
straight.
You're
not.
Now,
we
can
help
you.
Just
put
down
the
gun.
I
belong
to
the
maze.
THOMAS:
Just
put
down
We
all
do.



Thomas...
Chuck.
Oh,
shit.
Shit.
Look
at
me,
look
at
me!
Oh,
shit!
THOMAS:
Chuck,
I
got
you,
buddy.
It's
okay.
Thomas,
Thomas...
No,
Chuck.
You're
gonna
Remember,
I
told
you
that.
Take
it.
THOMAS:
No.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
No,
Chuck,
you're
gonna
get...


Chuck.
Chuck?
Hey.
Hey,
Chuck,
come
on!
Come
on,
wake
up!

THOMAS:
Damn
it!

We
made
it.
I'm
sorry!
God
damn
it!
Damn
it!

Thomas.
Get
up,
Chuck!
Come
on!

THOMAS:
Chuck!
You
can't
just
leave
him
there!
You
guys
all
right?
Don't
worry.
You're
safe
now.
Relax,
kid.
Everything
is
gonna
change.
I
think
it's
safe
to
say
the

I
wasn't
expecting
the
more
the
merrier.
Thomas
continues
to
And
for
now,
they
seem
It's
too
soon
to
say...
but
they
could
be
So
let's
move
forward.
It's
time
now
