excuse

what's

{SCOFFS}
I
would
give
you
points
if
we
hadn't

One
of

things
a
virus
or
A

circulatory
system.
I'm
afraid
it
boils
down
You
can't
make

person

{SIGHS}
It's
not
for
them.
It's
for
us.
I
believe
these
things
have
a
weakness.
And
that
weakness
is
weakness.
-
Our
weakness.
I
have
witnessed
them
Walk
right
around
them
like
I
think,
because
those
people
were
sick.
I
think
they
were
terminal.
And
these
things
could
sense
it.
I
think
they're
spreading
a
pathogen,
and
they
need
a
healthy
host.
But
even
if
you're
right,
I
mean,
with
a
lethal
illness
is
not
exactly
a
cure.
It's
not
a
cure.
It's

It's

There's

all
he

Typhus,
H1N1,

The
problem
is,
they're
all

What's
the
matter
with
