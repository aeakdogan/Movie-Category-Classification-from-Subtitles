She's
a
little
bit
anxious.
It
has
to
do
with
this
job,
which,
judging
by
the
fact
I
take
it
that
What
job?
Would
you
like
some
tea?
Uh...
Sure.
I
was
very
impressed
with
how
you
managed
to
get
Freezing
that
metal
Were
you
watching
me?
Scott,
I've
been
Ever
since

Oh!
Excuse
me.

was
supposed
But
you
beat
it.
Would
you
like
some
sugar?
Yeah,
thanks.
You
know
what?
I'm
okay.
How
do
you
make
them
do
that?
Ants
can
lift
objects
They
build,
farm,
Right.
But
how
do
you
I
use
electromagnetic
waves
I
speak
to
them.
I
can
go
anywhere,
and
see
everything.
And
still
know
I'm
late
to
meet
Cross.

Uh...
Dr.
Pym?
You
don't
need
to
Sorry,
Who
are
you,
who
is
she,
and
can
I
go
back
to
jail
now?
Come
with
me.
40
years
ago,
that
altered
atomic
SCOTT:
Huh?
I
learned
how
to
change
That's
what
powers
the
suit.
That's
why
it
works.
SCOTT:
Wow.

-
Whoa!
It
was
too
dangerous.
So
I
hid
it
from
the
world.
And
that's
when
I
switched
gears
Pym
Tech.
Yes.
I
took
on
a
young
protege
SCOTT:
Darren
Cross.
He's
a
big
deal.
But
before
he
was
a
big
deal,
I
thought
I
saw
something
in
him.
He
was
brilliant,
he
began
to
suspect
He
heard
rumors
about
and
he
became
obsessed
But
I
wouldn't
help
him.
So
he
conspired
against
me
and
How
could
he
do
that?
The
board's
chairman
She
was
the
deciding
vote.
But
she
came
back
to
me
when
she
saw
how
close
The
process
is
highly
volatile.
If
one
isn't
protected
it
can
affect
I
don't
think
and,
you
know,
he's
not
So,
what
do
you
want
from
me?
Scott,
I
believe
that
everyone
deserves
Do
you?
I
do.
If
you
can
help
me,
I
promise
I
can
help
you
be
Now,
are
you
ready
Absolutely.
My
days
of
breaking
into
places
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
I
want
you
to
break
into
a
place

Are
you
gonna
be
home
Uh,
yeah.
Okay.
Good
news?
Uh...
I
don't
know.
It's
news.
Are
you
trying
Yeah,
I
am,
sweetheart.
I
just
want
your
Hope
you
don't
catch

This
isn't

tried
to
get
their
hands
That's
Mitchell
Carson,
Presently
in
the
business
He
always
wanted
my
tech.
And
now,
unless
we
break
in
and
destroy
all
the
data,
Darren
Cross
is
gonna
unleash
chaos
I
think
our
first
move
should
be

I
spent
half
my
life
trying
to
keep
this
technology
I'm
sure
as
hell
not
gonna
This
is
not
some
cute
technology
This
could
change
Besides,
dropping
cities
Okay,
then
why
don't
you
Scott,
they
are
ants.
Ants,
they
can
do
a
lot
of
things,
Somebody
that
could
that's
designed
to
Hank,
I'm
a
thief,
all
right?
I'm
a
good
thief,
He's
right,
Hank.
You've
seen
the
footage,
I
was
against
using
him
and
now
we
have
days.
I'm
wearing
the
suit.
Absolutely
not!
I
know
the
facility
inside
and
out.
I
know
this
mission
We
need
you
close
to
Cross.
We
don't
have
Hope,
please
He
is
a
criminal!
-



She's
right,
Hank.
I'm
not
your
guy.
Why
don't
you
wear
the
suit?

You
think
I
don't
want
to?
I
can't.
I
spent
years
wearing
it,
and
it
took
a
toll
on
me.

You're
our
only
option.
Before
Hope
lost
her
mother,
she
used
to
look
at
me
like
And
now
she
looks
at
me
It's
too
late
for
me,
but
not
for
you.
This
is
your
chance.
The
chance
to
earn
that
look
To
become
the
hero
It's
not
about
It's
about
saving
theirs.
Damn.
That
was
a
good
speech.
Scott,
I
need
you
to
be
the
Ant-Man.
In
the
right
hands,
the
relationship
The
suit
has
power.
You
need
to
be
skillful,
you
need
to
be
fast.
You
should
be
able
on
a
dime.
So
your

Now
dive
through
the
keyhole,
You
charge
big,
you
dive
small,

Useless.
When
you're
small,
so
you
have
the
force
behind
a
fist
a
100th
of
an
inch
wide.
You
punch
too
hard,
you
kill
someone.
In
other
words,
I
was
in
prison
for
three
years.
Show
me.
-
Terrible.
Show
me...

That's
how
you
punch.
She's
been
No

All
right,

Were
you

I

Cool.
You've
learned
about

but
you've
yet
to

Loyal,
brave,

They're

Oh,

You

lock
your

I

really,
there's
some

Do
you
think
this
is
a

Do
you
have
any
idea
what
You
have

I'm
doing
this
for
her.
You
know,
when
my
mother
died,
He
was
in
grief.
Yeah,
And
he
never
came
back.
He
just
sent
me
off
You

I

with
all
that's
at

just
maybe
we
might
have

even
now,

out.
Then
why
are
you
here?
It

Hope.
Look
at

I'm
expendable.
That's

I'm
here.

Anyway...
You
know,
I
didn't
know
when
I
called
the

on
you.
What's
her
name?
Cassie.
It's
a
pretty
name.
You
have
to
clear
You
have
to
make
That's
how
it
works.
Think
about
Cassie.
About
how
badly
you
want
to
see
her.
Open
your
eyes
and
just
think
about
That's
good!
Your
mother
convinced
me
to
let
her
join
They
called
her
the
Wasp.
She
was
born
to
it.
And
there's
not
that
I
don't
It
was
1987.
Separatists
had
hijacked
and
launched
an

way
to

through

I

Your

she
didn't
hesitate.
Janet!
No!
She
turned
off
her
regulator
and
went
subatomic
to
deactivate
the
bomb.
And
she
was
gone.
Your
mom
died
a
hero.
And
I
spent
the
next
10
years
trying
to
learn
all
I
could
You
were
trying
But
all
I
learned
It's
not
your
fault.
She
made
her
choice.

I
was
trying
to
protect
you.
I
lost
your
mother.
I
didn't
mean
I'm
sorry.
This
is
awesome.
It's
awesome,
you
know?
You
guys
are
breaking
down
walls,
It's
important.
I
ruined
the
moment,
didn't
I?
Yes,
you
did.
Yes.
I'm
going
to
make
some
tea.
Nailed
it!
That's
a
good
boy,
Ant-thony.
HANK:
The
final
phase
of
your
training
SCOTT:
It's
freezing!
You
couldn't
make
a

You
must
retrieve

that
I
invented

We
need
it
to

All
right,
Ant-thony,
Oh,
it
feels
like
a
big
leap
Stay
calm.
SCOTT:
Guys?
Hank,
didn't
you
say
It's
not!
You
son
of
a
bitch!
-
Scott,
get
out
of
there.
Abort
now!
No,
it's
okay.
It
doesn't
look
Ant-thony,
get
me
to
the
roof!
He's
gonna
lose
the

He's
gonna
lose
his
life.

All
right,
I'm
on
the
roof
Somebody's
home,
Scott.
MAN:
What's
going
on
SCOTT:
It's
the

I
had
a

trip
Wait
a
second.
HANK:
Abort,
Scott!
Abort
now!
It's
okay.
He
can't
see
me.
I
can
see
you.
He
can
see
me.
Hi.
I'm
Scott.
Did
he
just
say,
What
are
you
doing
here?
First
off,
I'm
a
big
fan.
Appreciate
it.
I'm
Ant-Man.
"Ant-Man"?
What?
You
haven't
heard
of
me?
No,
you
wouldn't
You
wanna
tell
I
was
hoping
I
could
grab
Just
for
a
few
days.
I
need
it
to
save

I

exactly
how
that
is.

What
the

are
you
doing?
FALCON:

has
some

SCOTT:
Sorry!
Look,
I'm
sorry
about
this.
That's
enough!

Ant-thony!
A
little
help!
I've
lost
visual.

He's
inside
my
pack!
Sorry!
You
seem
like

It's
really
important
to
me
That
was
completely
irresponsible
You
jeopardized
everything!
You
got
it.
Well
done.
SCOTT:
Wait
a
minute.
Did
you
just
compliment
me?
He
did,
didn't
he?
Kind
of
sounded
like
he
did.

I
was
good,
wasn't
I?

Hey,
how
about
the
fact
that
Let
us
not
dwell
on
the
past.
We
gotta
finish
our

Don't
mind

You
did

This
is

Sure,
Darren.
Yeah,
sure.
I'll
be
there.
What
did
you
see
in
me?
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
All
those
years

What
did
you

I
saw

Then
why
did
you
push

away?
Because
I

He

We
have
to
call

off.
We're
all
taking
risks.
What
if
he

He
didn't.
There's
no
way.
How
do
you
know
that?

Darren,
hi.
Hope,
where
are
you
right
now?
I'm
at
home.
Why?
I
just
saw
Hank.
I
still
get
nothing
Don't
let
him

up.
We

Great.
Good
idea.
Thank
you,
Hope.
He's
tripling
security.
But
he
is
not

He's
adding

I
will

are

we
expand

What
do
we

SCOTT:
Wait,
I

I
gave
them

Hank
explained
the

They
fell

Hey,

PAXTON:

Mommy!
PAXTON:
HANK:
Scott,
please.
You
don't
remember
anything?
Hank.
I
don't.
There
must
be
something
else.
Well,
I
suppose
the
human
mind
just
can't
but
you
made
it.
You
went
in,
and
you
got
out.
It's
amazing.
Scott,
I'll
walk
you
out.
Get
some
rest.

Is
it
possible?

When
did
this
happen?
Nothing's
happening.
Whoa.
Hold
on.
Well,
if
that's
the
case,
shoot
me
again.
Yeah.
I
don't
know
grabbing
and
I'm
a
little
surprised
myself.
I
have
to
get
somewhere.
Really,
Hope.
-
Scott.
-
You're
full
of
shit.
PAXTON:
Scott,
He
wanted
a
report
on
the
night
Something
happened
Some
circuits
got
fried.
But
I
told
him
that
Really?
PAXTON:
Well,
yeah.
Can't
be
sending
Cassie's
dad
Thank
you,
Paxton.
I'm
blown
away.
Thank
you
for
everything
Well,
that's
my
pleasure.
But,
no.
-
This
is
awkward.
Yeah.

I
mean,
what
do
we
even
talk
about
-
Oh,
I
know.
I
did
my
first
What?
Yeah.
She
has
been
But
today
was
the
magic
day.
I
recorded
it
on
my
phone.
SCOTT:
No,
that
can't
be
Cassie.
-
MAGGIE:
Yeah,
it
is.
SCOTT:
This
is
a
professional
gymnast.
PAXTON:
Yeah,
that's
her.
Good
boy.
Sweetie,
that's

Sorry.
It's
work.
Yeah.
All
right.
Here's
the
deal.
Just
the
facts.
Breathe.
No,
no,
no.
So,
I'm
at
this
art
museum
And
there
was
this,
like,
But
you
know
me,
I'm
more
But
there
was
this
one
Rothko
Luis.
Okay,
sorry.
Sorry.
You
know,
But
anyway,
Ignacio
tells
me,
"Yo,
I
met
this
"at
the
Spot
last
night.
"Like
crazy-stupid
fine."
"goes
up
to
"Look
at
the
girl
I'm
with.
"She's
The
bartender's
all
like,
So
this
writer
"Yo,
I'm
like
a
boss
"and
I
got
mad
connects
"you
know
what
I'm
saying?"
Ignacio's
like,
"For
real?"
And
she's
like,
I
can't
tell
you
"because
he
works
Oh,
no.
Yeah,
and
this
dude
sounds
Like,
"Yo,
I'm
looking
for
this
dude
"who's
flashing
"who's
got,
like,
bomb
moves,
right?
And
she's
like,
nowadays.
"We
got
a
guy
who
swings,
"You
gotta
be
more
specific."
And
he's
like,
And
I'm,
like,
"Damn!"
'cause
I'd
keep
mad
So
I
asked
Ignacio,
"Did
the
badass
tell
"to
tell
you
to
tell
me,
"that
he's
looking
for
him?"
And?
What'd
he
say?
He
said,
"Yes."
There's
something
I
realized
you
All
you
can
do
is
make
sure
This
is
an
advanced
prototype
that
your
mother
and
I
She
never
got
to
use
it.
But
now
I
realize
that
we
were...
Maybe
it's
time
It's
about
damn
time.
FALCON:
Hey,
Cap!
This
would
have

If
we
call
Tony...
Even
if
he
did...
Who
knows
if

We're
on
our
own.
Maybe
not.
I
know
a
guy.
