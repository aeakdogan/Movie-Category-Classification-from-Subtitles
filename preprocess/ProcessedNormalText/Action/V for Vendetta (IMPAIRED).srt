it

Let
me
say
that

Godlessness.

It
was

Good

Oh,

How
did
you
get

Don't
worry,
I've
made
sure
...any
pesky
late-night
phone
calls,
Stop.
Why
do
you
keep
calling
me
that?
That
was
your

remember?
You
wore
a

in
those

You.
-It
is
you.

-Yeah?
-Dascomb.

Would

or
the

Did
you
have
anything
-Yes,
I
killed

-Oh,

I'm
upset?
I
might
have
killed

-What

Oh,

There's

Yes.

Well,

Problem
is,
I
can't
find

Larkhill?
I
cannot
recall

welcome

All
it
says
is
that
there
was
...approximately
10
miles
Well,
there
you
have
it.
This
is
a
matter
We
need
to
know
if
there
was

I'm
sorry,

Was
there
a
specific

-Usual

I

-Of

not.

We

we

And
in

That's
all
I
have
to
say
about
that.
You
can
do
this.
Hi.
I've
been
thinking....
There's
something
...but
I
don't
think
you'll
understand
why
My
father
was
a
writer.
He
used
to
say
artists
used
lies
...while
politicians
used
them
A
man
after
my
own
heart.
He
always
told
the
best
stories.
Until
my
brother
died.
That
was
when
everything
changed.
My
brother
was
one
of
the
students
After
he
died,
They
protested
the
war
When
Sutler
was
appointed
...they
were
at
the
riot
in
Leeds.
I
watched
on
the
television...
...thinking
I
was
going
I
remember
them
arguing
at
night.

to
leave

said

we

...it
was
a

-Mummy!
EVEY:

was

those

I'm
sorry,
Evey.
No,
I'm
the
one
that's
sorry.
Sorry
I'm
not
a
stronger
person.
Sorry
I'm
not
like
my
parents.
...but
I'm
not.
I
wish
I
wasn't
afraid
all
the
time...
...but
I
am.
I
know
this
world
is
screwed
up.
Which
is
why
I
wanted
to
ask,
if
there
is

let
me
know.
If
you
wish.
Do
you

thing

WOMAN'S
VOICE:
I
know
there's
...this
is
not
one
of
their
tricks,
I
am
me.
My
name
is
Valerie.
I
don't
think
I'll
live
much
longer.
This
is
the
only
autobiography
...I'm
writing
it
on
toilet
paper.
I
was
born
in
Nottingham
in
1985.
I
don't
remember
much
...but
I
do
remember
the
rain.
My
grandmother
owned
a
farm
...and
she
used
to
tell
me
I
passed
my
11
Plus
It
was
at
school
Her
name
was
Sarah.
It
was
her
wrists.
They
were
beautiful.
I
thought
we
would
I
remember
our
teacher
telling
us...
...that
it
was
an
adolescent
phase
Sarah
did.
I
didn't.
In
2002,
I
fell
in
love
That
year
I
came
out
to
my
parents.

VALERIE:
I
couldn't
have
done
it
My
father
wouldn't
look
at
me.

VALERIE:
But
I'd
only
told
them
the
truth.
Our
integrity
sells
for
so
little,
It
is
the
very
last
inch
of
us.
But
within
that
inch...
...we
are
free.
MAN:
-Just
tell
us
where
he
is.
VALERIE:
I'd
always
known
...and
in

I
starred
in

first
film,
It
was
the
most
important
role
of

first
time
we
kissed...

knew
I
never

moved

grew

Carsons
for
me
...and
our
place
always
smelt
of
roses.
Those
were
the
best
years
of
my
life.

VALERIE:
But

...and
eventually
came
to

Not

MAN:

gonna
die

protect
someone

VALERIE:
I
remember
how
the
meaning
How
unfamiliar
words
like
"collateral"
...while
things
like
"Norsefire"
and
the
I
remember
how
"different"
I
still
don't
understand
it...
...why
they
hate
us
so
much.

VALERIE:
They
took
Ruth
I've
never
cried
so
hard
in
my
life.
It
wasn't
long
till
they
came
for
me.
It
seems
strange
that
my
life
should
end
But
for
three
years,
I
shall
die
here.
Every
inch
of
me
shall
perish.
Every
inch...
...but
one.
An
inch.
It
is
small,
and
it
is
fragile...
...and
it
is
the
only
thing
We
must
never
lose
it
or
give
it
away.
I
hope
that,
whoever
you
are,
I
hope
that
the
world
turns
But
what
I
hope
most
of
all
...when
I
tell
you
that
...and
even
though
...laugh
with
you,
cry
with
you...
...or
kiss
you...
...I
love
you.
With
all
my
heart...

love
you.

wanted

But
each
time
you
refused
to
give
in,
You're
sick!
You're
evil!
You
could
have
ended
it.
-Why?
That's
it!
See,
at
first,
Hate
was
all
I
knew.
...taught
me
how
to
eat,
I
thought
I'd
die
But
then
something
happened.
It
happened
to
me
Shut
up!
I
don't
want
to
hear

said
Yes,
I
created
a
lie.
But

you
believed

I
can't
feel
anything
anymore!
Don't
run
from
it,
Evey.

I
can't....
Can't

Asthma.
When
I
was
little--
Listen
to
me,
Evey.
This
may
be
the
most
important
moment

They
took
your
parents
from
you.
They
put
you
in
a
cell
...except
your
life.
And
you
believed
that
was
all
The
only
thing
you
had
left
-Oh,
please.
In
that
cell,
you
found
something
When
they
threatened
to
kill
you
...you
told
them
you'd
rather
die.
You
faced
your
death,
Evey.
You
were
calm.
You
were
still.
Try
to
feel
now
what
you
felt
then.
Oh,
God.
I
felt....
Yes?
I'm
dizzy.
I
need

The
masks
were
ingenious.
It
was
strange
to
suddenly
see
Conceal
me
what
I
am,
...for
such
disguise
as
haply
EVEY:
Twelfth
Night.
-I
don't
understand.
How
you
can
be
one
of
the
most
...and
yet
I
know
I
don't
know
where
you
were
born,
...if
you
had
any
brothers
or
sisters.
I
don't
even
know
Evey,
please.
There
is
a
face
beneath
this
mask...
...but
it's
not
me.
I'm
no
more
that
face
than
I
am
...or
the
bones
beneath
them.
I
understand.
Thank
you.
There
isn't
much
time.
I
have
something
I
must
give
you.
I
went
by
Parliament.
Never
seen
anything
like
it.
Makes
you
wish
that
no
one
But
if
they
do,
What
usually
happens
...stand
up
to
people
with
guns.
Pull
over
here.
We've
searched
these
tunnels
for
weeks.
Inspector.
It's
all
gone
wrong,
hasn't
it?
The
Underground?
They
did.
It
took
nearly
10
years
to
Let
me
show
you.
These
tracks
lead
to
Parliament.
Yes.
Then
it's
really
going
to
happen,
It
will
if
you
want
it
to.
-What?
Everything
that
I
have:
my
home,
...l'm
leaving
to
you
to
do
with
Is
this
another
trick,
V?
No.
No
more
tricks.
No
more
lies.
Only
truth.
And
the
truth
is,
you
made
me
...that
the
choice
to
pull
this
lever
-Why?
...the
world
that
I'm
a
part
of
and
And
tomorrow,
...that
different
people
will
shape,
Where
are
you
going?
The
time
has
come
for
me
...and
to
repay
him
in
kind
V,
wait!
You
could
let
it
go.
No.
You
were
right
about
what
I
am.
I
have
no
tree
waiting
for
me.
All
I
want,
all
I
deserve,
That's
not
true.
I
can't.
My
fellow
Englishmen...
...tonight,
our
country...
...that
which
we
stand
for...
...and
all
that
we
hold
dear...
...faces
a
grave
and
terrible
threat.
SWEEPER:
This
violent
and
unparalleled
assault
...will
not
go
undefended.
Where
is
he?
Or
unpunished.
V:
Our
enemy
is
an
insidious
one,
...and
destroy
the
very
foundation
I
have
kept
my
side
of
the
bargain,
Bring
him
down.
Tonight
we
must
remain
steadfast.
We
must
remain
determined.
But
most
of
all,
Those
caught
tonight
...will
be
considered
in
league
...and
prosecuted
as
a
terrorist
I
want
to
see
his
face.
Tonight
I
give
you
...that
justice
will
be
swift...
...it
will
be
righteous...
...and
it
will
be
without
mercy.
Oh,
God.
No.
V:

I
have
something
for
you,
chancellor.
A
farewell
gift.
For
all
the
things
you've
done,
...and
for
the
only
thing
you
have
left.
Goodbye,
chancellor.
Mr.
Creedy.
Disgusting.

Now
that's
done
with...
...it's
time
to
have
a
look
Take
off
your
mask.
V:

Defiant
to
the
end,
huh?
You
won't
cry
like
him,
will
you?
You're
like
me.
The
only
thing
you
and
I
...is
we're
both
about
to
die.
How
do
you
imagine
With
my
hands
around
your
neck.
Bollocks.
What
are
you
gonna
do,
huh?
We've
swept
this
place.
Nothing
but
your
bloody
knives
We
have
guns.
No,
you
have
bullets
and
the
hope
...l'm
no
longer
standing,
...you'll
all
be
dead
That's
impossible!

Kill
him.

My
turn.


Die!
Die!
Why
won't
you
die?!
Why
won't
you
die?
Beneath
this
mask
Beneath
this
mask
there
is
an
idea,
And
ideas
are
bulletproof.




This
is
perimeter
one.
MAN:
Keep
communication
tight.
I
won't
have
this
getting
any
more
V!

Oh,
God,
we
have
to
stop
Please,
don't.
Don't
say
that.
I
told
you,
only
truth.
For
20
years
I
sought
only
this
day.
Nothing
else
existed...
...until
I
saw
you.
Then
everything
changed.
I
fell
in
love
with
you,
Evey...
...like
I
no
longer
believed
I
could.
V,
I
don't
want
you
to
die.
That's
the
most
beautiful
thing...
...you
could
have
ever
given
me.
V?
V?!

Eyes
and
ears
have
detected
movement
This
is
perimeter
one.

Hold
it.
Stop
right
there.
You're
Evey
Hammond,
aren't
you?
Then
it's
over?
Almost.
Stop.
Get
your
hand
off
that
lever.
No.
LIEUTENANT:
Enemy
is
approaching
fast.
-What
shall
we
do?
Or
from
Party
Leader
Creedy.
Or
from
the
high
chancellor.
Why
are
you
doing
this?
-Because
he
was
right.
That
this
country
needs
more
than
Bloody
hell,
stand
down!
Stand
down!
Jesus
bloody
Christ.

It's
time.
Tell
me...
...do
you
like
music,
Mr.
Finch?
[TCHAIKOVSKY'S
1812
OVERTURE
That
music?
Yes.
His
music.


Who
was
he?
He
was
Edmond
Dantes.
And
he
was
my
father...
...and
my
mother.
My
brother.
My
friend.
He
was
you...
...and
me.
He
was
all
of
us.
EVEY:
...and
what
it
meant
for
this
country.
But
I
will
never
forget
the
man...
...and
what
he
meant
to
me.
