Not
to
worry.
I
thought
Mademoiselle.
Messieurs.
No
diamonds,
No
codes,
no
diamonds.

Kill
this

ETHAN:
That
hallway
out
there
You
know
who
We
come
back
with
the
codes,
How
good
is
The
best.
Hmm.

MOREAU
ON
RADIO:

Do
you
care
for
some
sugar?
ETHAN
ON
RADIO:
Enough.
You
want
payment,
When
he's
authenticated
the
codes,
I'll
make
the
call
That
or...
We
all
go
home
Nobody
leaves
Get
the
papers.
JANE:
It's
locked.
JANE:
Ah,
forgive
me.
One
moment,
huh?




My
mistake.
You
tell
me
the
numbers.
They're
good.
Zero.
Zero.
Zero.

Come
on,
come
on,
come
on.


It
was
a
pleasure
Wistrom
has
the
launch
codes.
Hey,
I
did
as
you
asked.
Release
Leonid's
family.

Thank
God.
You
can
thank


MOREAU:
It
was
a
pleasure

Moreau's
on
the
move!
I've
got
her.
Jane?
She's
an
asset!
I
need
her
alive!
ETHAN:
Acknowledge!
Acknowledge!

Uh,
Ethan,
Wistrom
is
in
the
elevator.

Benji,
slow
him
down.


Find
Leonid.
Benji,
I've
got
a
lock
on
Wistrom.
Is
he
still

Benji?


Ethan.
Over?
Benji.

Ethan,
can
you
hear
me?
Ethan,
can
you
hear
me?
Over.

Jesus!
Sit
down!
Watch
her.
Because
if
I
do,

Hold
it,
Team
Leader.
Did
you
really
think
I
wouldn't
catch
up
with
you?
You
and
I
are
not
enemies.
We'll
find
out
Move
it!
I'm
sorry
about
this.

Leonid.
Benji?
Go
for
Benji.
I've
got
Leonid
by
the

What?


Hey,
hey.
Stay
with
me.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,

BRANDT:
Jane!
No!

























Come
on.
Come
on.















Now,
what
happened
She
couldn't
help
us
So
let's
throw
her
I
didn't
throw
her.
Let's
throw
her
She
was
not
The
mission
was
to
track
the
file
back
to
Hendricks,
with
nuclear
launch
codes!
JANE:
Maybe
you
didn't
notice
BRANDT:
Yeah,
like
you
didn't
or
that
we're
about
JANE:
It
was
an
BRANDT:
It
doesn't
matter!
We're
talking
The
asset
is
more
JANE:
Where
do
you
get
off
We
inherited
you.
You're
just
Better
have
good
news
for
me.
JANE:
You
think
I
need
you
to
Yeah,
I
got
it.
And
no
one
will
be
Just
make
sure
And
how
the
hell
did
the
Russians
find
us?
What
are
you
asking
me
for?
You're
in
charge
of
BRANDT:
You
cannot
afford
to
You're
not
a
technician
anymore.
And
you're
just
Right?
Right?
Who
are
you
What
are
you
asking?
Let
me
see
if
I
can
How
does
an
agent
with
skills

Well,
we
all
Don't
we,
Ethan?
You
tell
me
yours,

I
have
friends
in
the
region.
I'll
send
someone
JANE:
What
about
Hendricks?
The
plan
was
for
us
BENJI:
Well,
Change
the
plan.
JANE:
Wait.
What
are
you
going
to
do,
Would
you
care
to
explain
yourself,
(OVERLAPPING
CHATTER
I
was
on
a
protection
Shadowing
the
assets,
They
were
never
supposed
to
know
we
were
there.
Whole
thing's
routine,
Three
days
in
we
caught
wind
that
a
Serbian
But
my
team
had
We
knew
they
But
I
couldn't
shake
this
feeling
that
I
wanted
to
find
a
way
to
let
them
know.
But,
you
know,

One
day,
so
I
follow
him,
When
I
get
back,
Local
police
found
her
body
three
days
later.
What
was
left
That
was
my
last
I
couldn't
face
another
life-or-death
situation
after
that.
So
what
happened
I
never
saw
him
again.
Until
two
days
ago
when
the
Secretary
introduced
me
to
Ethan
Hunt.
No,
that's
not
what
happened.
BRANDT:
Yeah,
I
heard
But,
unfortunately,
Just
like
I
was
there
when
the
that
Ethan
was
in
custody
for
killing
An
unsanctioned
hit.
Yeah.
Disavowed.

The
next
thing
I
know,
I'm
on
a
plane
to
Dubai,
wondering
the
whole
time,
How
do
I
tell
him?
That
I'm
responsible.
I
could
have
warned
him.
I
should
have
warned
him.
But
I
didn't.
And
she
died.
Sergei!
Sergei,
I
told
you
I
would
get
him
here.
How
do
I
know
it's
him?
Yes,
it's
him.
You
trust
me,
This
is
the
guy!
This
is
the
guy,
So
we
can
take

Sorry.
He's
a
great
guy,
MAN:
So,
you
work
for
ETHAN:
And
you're
BOGDAN:
No,
no,
no.
He's
"independent
defense
coordinator."
That
you
are.
Listen.
He's
a
friend.
Those

No,
no.
It's
okay.
Whatever
arrangements
you
made
with
You
want
something
You
misunderstand.
You're
selling.
Selling
what?
The
future.
Yeah,
I
got
all
I
need,
ETHAN:
Our
countries

is
very
good
Nuclear
war?
Go
on.
I'm
looking
for
a
man
You
may
know
him
In
either
case,
I'll
bet
he
even
tried
to
buy
it
from
you
at
some
point.
Go
on.
He
has
a
case,
But
they're
worthless
I
want
to
know
A
man
with
information
like
that
And
to
your
government,
a
potential
terrorist
If
you
help
me,
my
friends
Sorry.
I
cannot
help
you.
I
certainly
cannot
tell
you

Working
on

Helping
old

you
cannot

in

It's
our

How'd
you
get
it?
Made
a
friend.
Well,
I'm
glad
You
could
help
now.
Look,
Ethan,
ETHAN:
Whatever
happened,
We
still
have
a
chance
to
clean
this
up,
And
we
have
to

So,
where

Okay.
Great.

On
the
surface,
But
it's
built
on
Cold
War
cast-offs,
including
this,
Hendricks
needs
it
and
we
have
to
shut
it
down
And
to
do
that,
One
way
or
another.
And
if
I
don't,
none
of
this
works.
You
can
do
this.
Yeah.
A
week
ago,
I
don't
blame
you
She
took
someone
That's
not
something
let
go.
Did
it
make
you
When
you
killed
the
men
We
can't
get
them
back.
Okay,
to
shut
down
we
have
to
manually
tap
into
the
central
server.
You'll
enter
through
wearing
this
under
your
suit.
Drop
down
into
the

then
move
you
along
and
you

Okay,
so
we
enter
the
party

the

I
switch
off

and
I
catch

then
Ethan
feeds
me
the

Okay,
but
you
just
breezed
over
The
computer
array
part,
Jump?
And
I
catch
you.
I
don't...
Why
is
that
Well...
Why?
It's
a
25-foot
drop.
Yeah.
In
light
of
our
recent
efforts,
The
science
is
sound.
I'd
be
more
worried
And
then
there's
that.
Well,
it's
like
any
If
you
switch
off
the
fan,

Of
course.
Relatively,
you
know.
Of
course
it
will.
Uh,
an

Yeah.
Essentially.
But,
um,
I'll
catch
you.
Great.
