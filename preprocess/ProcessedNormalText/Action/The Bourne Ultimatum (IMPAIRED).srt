Bourne's
last
confirmed

Now,
Sir,
with
respect,
I
think,
What...
what's
he
after?
The
reason
that
Bourne
went
to
Moscow
What's
your
point
Pam?
Maybe
he
was
retracing
his
steps.
Just
looking
for
something...
Maybe
he
hasn't
found
it
yet.
You're
telling
me,
he's
not

I
think
if
he
wanted
to
hurt
us
Maybe
he
still
will.
My
number

rule
is:
As
far
as
I'm
concerned,
Bourne's
still

Let's
keep
looking!
This

Why
don't
you

Where
is
she?
She's
dead.
She
was
killed.
I'm
sorry.
I
knew
this
can
end
this
way.

It
was
always
gonna
end
this

And
how
did
she
die?
She
was
shot.

Yes.
And

just
the

of
the
iceberg.
