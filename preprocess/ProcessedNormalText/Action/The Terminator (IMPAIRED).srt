What
the
hell...?
What
the
hell...?
Hey,
my
turn.
Hey,
what's
wrong
with
this
picture?
Nice
night
for
a
walk?
Nice
night
for
a
walk.
Wash
day
tomorrow.
Nothing
clean.
Right.
I
think
this
guy's
a
couple
of
cans
short
of
a
six-pack.
Your
clothes,
give
them
to
me.
-
Now.
Hey,
buddy,
did
you
just
see
a
real
bright
light?
-
See
that
guy?
-
He's
rabbiting.
Go.
That
son-of-a-bitch
took
my
pants.
-
What
day
is
it?
The
date.
-
Thursday.
He's
got
my
gun.
Let's
go.
Guard
it
for
me,
Big
Buns.
Hi.
I'm
late.
So
am
I.
-
I'm
in
it.
-
Honey,
can
I
have
that
coffee
now,
please?
-
OK.
Who
gets
the
burly-beef?
-
That's
mine,
but
I
didn't
order
fries.
-
Mine's
the
chilli
beef
deluxe.
-
We're
ready
to
order
now.
I'm
so
sorry.
This
isn't
real
leather,
is
it?
Nice
going,
kid.
Look
at
it
this
way.
The
12-gauge
auto-loader.
That's
Italian.
The
45
long
slide
with
laser
sighting.
These
are
brand
new.
We
just
got
them
in.
Just
touch
the
trigger,
the
beam
comes
on...
...and
you
put
the
red
dot
where
you
want
the
bullet
to
go.
You
can't
miss.
-
Anything
else?
Hey,
just
what
you
see,
pal.
The
Uzi
nine
millimetre.
You
know
your
weapons,
buddy.
Any
one
of
these
is
ideal
for
home
defence.
So
which
will
it
be?
-
All.
It's
a
15-day
wait
on
the
handguns,
-
You
can't
do
that.
Hi,
baby.
Yeah,
yeah,
it's
me.
Listen,
I
need
you
to
come
pick
me
up.
I
don't
care
what
you're
doing.
Hey,
man,
you
got
a
serious
attitude
problem.
-
Sarah
Connor?
I'm
on
my
break,
Chuck.
Sarah,
come
here.
It's
about
you.
It's
so
incredible.
You're
not
gonna
believe
this.
-
What?
Once
again,
Sarah
Connor,
35,
mother
of
two,...
...brutally
shot
to
death
in
her
home
this
afternoon.
You're
dead,
honey.
..if
you're
into
sound,...
...for
the
greatest
sound
around,
We've
got
woofers,
tweeters,
the
We've
got
graphic
equalisers
and
sound
balancers
that...
Sorry.
Hello?
First
I'm
gonna
rip
the
buttons
off
your
blouse
one
by
one,...
...and
then
run
my
tongue
down
your
neck
to
your
bare,
And
then
slowly...
Ginger,
it's
Matt.
And
lick
your
belly
in
circles
further
and
further
down,...
...and
then
pull
your
panties
off
with
my
teeth.
Who
is
this?
God.
Sarah?
Jesus.
I'm
sorry.
I
thought
you
were...
Sure,
Bunky.
It's
the
creep.
Hello?
First
I'll
rip
the
buttons
off
your
blouse
one
by
one...
You
fucking
pigs.
Ed.
-
What
have
you
got?
-
I
can
see
that.
Shot
six
times
at
less
than
10
feet.
You
know,
these
work.
-
What's
this?
Sent
over
from
the
Valley
division
this
afternoon.
Are
you
sure
there's
a
point
to
all
of
this?
Look
at
the
name,
Ed.
Sarah
Louise
Connor.
Is
this
right?
You're
kidding
me.
The
press
is
going
to
be
short-stroking
it
all
over.
-
A
one-day
pattern
killer.
So...
Better
than
mortal
man
deserves.
-
Ginger,
have
you
seen
Pugsley?
I
thought
you
did.
-
Hi,
Sarah,
this
is
your
mom...
You
mind
your
mother.
Hi,
Sarah.
Stan
Morsky.
Looks
like
I
won't
be
able
to
make
it
tonight.
Look
I'm
really
sorry.
I'll
make
it
up
to
you.
That
bum.
So
what
if
he
has
a
Porsche?
He
can't
treat
you
like
this.
I'll
live.
I'll
break
his
kneecaps.
Well,
Pugsley
still
loves
me.
God.
It's
disgusting.
I'm
gonna
go
to
a
movie,
kiddo.
-
We
will.
You,
too.
Damn
it,
Matt.
Oh,
shit.
Lieutenant,
are
you
aware
that
these
two
killings...
...occurred
in
the
same
order
as
their
listings
in
the
phone
book?
-
Now,
what
can
I
tell
you
guys?
No
comment.
That
coffee's
two
hours
cold.
I
put
a
cigarette
out
in
it.
-
Did
you
reach
the
next
girl
yet?
-
Send
a
unit.
-
...and
the
apartment
manager's
not
in.
-
I
just
called
her.
Give
me
a
cigarette.
Hi,
there.
Fooled
you.
But
don't
be
shy.
It's
OK.
Same
shit.
I
can
hear
it
now.
I
hate
these
press
cases.
-
Where
are
you
going?
Maybe
make
these
jackals
work
for
us
for
a
change.
If
I
can
get
on
the
tube
by
eleven
o'clock,
Well,
how
do
I
look?
-
Like
shit,
boss.
This
just
in.
...in
the
second
of
two
execution-style
murders
which
took
place
today.
Incredibly,
the
names
of
the
two
victims
are
virtually
identical.
Two
hours
ago,
35-year-old
Sarah
Ann
Connor

Santa
Monica
apartment...
-
...was
slain
by
alone
gun
man
earlier
today
in
her
home.
Now,
police
are
refusing
to
speculate
on
the...
...apparent
similarity
between
these
shooting
deaths...
...and
no
other
connection
between
the
Ofcourse
we'll
have
more
on
this
late-breaking
story
as
it
comes
in.
-
Hey,
you
got
a
phone?
Hey.
Four-fifty.
You
have
reached
the
Los
Angeles
Police
Department
emergency
number.
All
our
lines
are
busy.
If
you
need
a
police
Pugsley,
shoo!
Go
on.
I'm
gonna
make
a
belt
out
of
you.
Don't
make
me
bust
you
up,
man.
Hi,
there.
Fooled
you.
But
don't
be
shy.
It's
OK.
So
talk
to
it
and
Ginger,
that's
me,
Wait
for
the
beep.
Ginger,
this
is
Sarah!
I'm
at
this
place
on
Pico
Boulevard
called
Tech
Noir.
...think
that
there's
somebody
after
me.
I
need
you
and
Matt
to
come
and
pick
me
up
as
soon
as
possible.
The
police
keep
transferring
me
around.
The
number
here
is
555
9175.
It's
her.
Sarah
Connor?
It's
Lieutenant
Traxler.
Don't
put
me
on
hold.
Don't
worry
I
won't.
And
just
relax.
-
I'm
in
this
bar
called
Tech
Noir.
-
Are
you
all
right?
-
I
think
there's
a
guy
following
me.
You're
in
a
public
place
so
you'll
be
safe
till
we
get
there.
Don't
go
outside
or
even
to
the
rest
room.
-
I'll
have
a
car
there
in
a
hot
minute.
Hey,
that
guy
didn't
pay.
Come
with
me
if
you
wanna
live.
Come
on!
This
is
one-L-19.
I
got
a
hit-and-run
felony.
Suspect
vehicle
-
late
model
grey
Ford
headed
westbound
on
Seven.
He's
really
moving
-
punching
lights
all
the
way.
I'm
gonna
need
an
ambulance
at
Seventh
and
Broadway
right
now.
Hold
it.
Hold
on.
Are
you
injured?
Are
you
shot?
Do
exactly
what
I
say.
Exactly.
Don't
move
unless
I
say.
Do
you
understand?
-
Do
you
understand?
I'm
here
to
help
you.
I'm
Reese.
Sergeant
Tech-Com,
DN38416.
You've
been
targeted
for
termination.
This
is
one-L-19.
This
is
a
mistake.
I
didn't
do
anything.
No,
but
you
will.
This
isn't
true.
It's
not
a
man.
A
machine.
A
Terminator.
A
machine?
Like
a
robot?
Not
a
robot.
-
No.
He
was
bleeding.
Get
your
head
down.
All
right,
listen.
The
Terminator's
an
infiltration
unit.
Underneath
it's
a
hyper-alloy
combat
chassis.
Fully
armoured,
very
tough.
Flesh,
skin,
hair,
blood
-
grown
for
the
cyborgs.
-
Look,
Reese,
I
don't
know
what
you
want...
I
gotta
ditch
this
car.
The
600-Series
had
rubber
skin.
But
these
are
new.
They
look
human.
Sweat,
bad
breath,
everything.
I
had
to
wait
till
he
moved
on
you
before
I
could
zero
him.
Look,
I
am
not
stupid
you
know.
Not
yet.
Not
for
about
forty
years.
Are
you
saying
it's
from
the
future?
One
possible
future.
I
don't
know
tech
stuff.
Then
you're
from
the
future,
too.
-
Right.
Cyborgs
don't
feel
pain.
-
Just
let
me
go.
That
Terminator
is
out
there.
It
can't
be
bargained
with,
it
can't
be
reasoned
with.
It
doesn't
feel
pity
or
remorse
or
fear...
...and
it
absolutely
will
not
stop,
ever,
until
you
are
dead.
Can
you
stop
it?
I
don't
know.
With
these
weapons,
I
don't
know.
All
units,
all
units.
Gray
Ford
suspect
vehicle
Reese,
why
me?
Why
does
it
want
me?
There
was
a
nuclear
war.
A
few
years
from
now,...
...all
this,
this
whole
place,
everything,...
...it's
gone,
just
gone.
There
were
survivors.
Here,
there.
Nobody
even
knew
who
started
it.
-
It
was
the
machines,
Sarah.
Defence
network
computers.
New,
powerful,...
...hooked
into
everything,
trusted
to
run
it
all.
They
say
it
got
smart
-
a
new
order
of
intelligence.
Then
it
saw
all
people
as
a
threat.
It
decided
our
fate
in
a
microsecond.
Extermination.
Did
you
see
this
war?
No.
I
grew
up
after.
In
the
ruins.
Starving.
Hiding
from
the
H-Ks.
-
H-Ks?
Patrol
machines
built
in
automated
factories.
Most
of
us
were
rounded
up.
This
was
burned
in
by
laser
scanner.
Some
of
us
were
kept
alive.
To
work.
Loading
bodies.
The
disposal
units
ran
night
and
day.
We
were
that
close
to
going
out
forever.
But
there
was
one
man
who
taught
us
to
fight.
To
storm
the
wire
of
the
camps.
To
smash
those
metal
motherfuckers
into
junk.
He
turned
it
around.
His
name
was
Connor.
John
Connor.
Your
son,
Sarah.
Your
unborn
son.
Drive.
Reese!
No,
Reese.
No,
no,
no.
They'll
kill
you.
You
in
the
Cadillac,
let
me
see
your
hands
now.
Get
out
of
the
car.
Drop
to
your
knees.
-
Out
of
the
car.
Sarah.
Sarah,
try
to
drink
some
of
this.
Listen,
are
you
sure
it's
them?
I
mean,
maybe
I
should
look
at
the
bodies.
No.
They've
been
identified
and
there's
no
doubt.
Ginger.
Kiddo.
-
Sarah,
Sarah,
this
is
Dr
Silberman.
I
want
you
to
tell
him
everything
that
Reese
told
you,
Sarah.
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
-
You're
a
doctor?
-
Is
Reese
crazy?
So
you're
a
soldier.
Fighting
for
whom?
With
the
132nd
under
Perry.
That's
the
year
2027?
That's
right.
Then
I
was
assigned...
-
This
is
fucking
great.
-
Who
was
the
enemy?
Goddamn!
Sorry.
..built
for
SAC-NORAD
by
Cyberdyne
Systems.
I
see.
And
this
computer
thinks
it
can
win
by
killing
the
mother
of
its
enemy.
Killing
him,
in
effect,
before
he's
even
conceived.
A
sort
of
retroactive
abortion?
That
guy
Silberman
cracks
me
up.
-
He
screwed
it
first
then
he
set
it
on
fire.
Why
didn't
the
computer
just
kill
Connor
then?
Why
this
elaborate
scheme
with
the
Terminator?
It
had
no
choice.
We'd
won.
Skynet
had
to
wipe
out
his
entire
existence.
Is
that
when
you
captured
the
lab
complex
and
The
time
displacement
equipment?
That's
right.
Connor
sent
me
to
intercept
and
they
blew
the
whole
place.
Well,
how
are
you
supposed
to
get
back?
I
can't.
Nobody
goes
home.
It's
just
him
and
me.
It's
just
him
and
me.
Why
didn't
you
bring
any
weapons?
Don't
you
have
ray
guns?
-
Ray
guns.
You
go
naked.
Nothing
dead
will
go.
OK,
OK.
But
this
cyborg,
if
it's
metal...
?
-
Surrounded
by
living
tissue.
This
is
great
stuff.
You
see
how
clever
this
part
is?
Most
paranoid
delusions
are
intricate,
but
this
is
brilliant.
-
Why
were
the
other
two
women
killed?
Skynet
knew
almost
nothing
about
Connor's
mother.
Her
full
name,
where
she
lived.
The
Terminator
was
just
being
systematic.
-
Well,
let's
go
back...
I
have
answered
your
questions.
-
I'm
afraid
that's
not
up
to
me.
-
Because
I
can
help
you.
Shut
up!
You
still
don't
get
it,
do
you?
He'll
find
her.
That's
what
he
does.
He'll
wade
through
you,
-
Doc.
Sorry.
So,
Reese
is
crazy?
In
technical
terminology,
he's
a
loon.
Sarah,
this
is
what
they
call
body
armour.
It'll
stop
a
12-gauge
round.
This
other
individual
must
been
wearing
one
under
his
coat.
-
What
about
when
he
punched
through
the
windshield?
Broke
every
bone
in
his
hand
and
wouldn't
feel
it
for
hours.
There
was
this
guy
once...
-
Here.
There's
a
couch
in
this
other
room.
It'll
be
an
hour
before
your
mother
gets
here
from
Big
Bear.
-
I
can't
sleep.
Well
it
may
not
look
it,
but
that
couch
is
very
comfortable.
You'll
be
perfectly
safe.
Thank
you.
-
Good
night.
I'm
a
friend
of
Sarah
Connor.
No.
Can't
see
her.
Where
is
she?
Look
it
make
take
a
while.
I'll
be
back.
Stay
here.
Watch
him.
Ed...
Sarah!
Reese.
This
way.
KFLB
news
time.
4.36.
In
the
top
story
of
the

the
largest

California
history
is
currently
underway.
Police
in
five
southern
counties
are
Take
this.
All
right.
Let's
get
this
off
the
road.
-
You
cold?
Reese?
-
You
got
a
first
name?
Kyle,
what's
it
like
when
you
go
through
time?
White
light.
Pain.
-
It's
like
being
born
maybe.
I
caught
one
back
there.
-
You
mean
you
got
shot?
-
We
gotta
get
you
to
a
doctor.
What
do
you
mean,
forget
it?
Jesus.
See?
It
passed
right
through
the
meat.
This
is
gonna
make
me
puke.
-
Would
you
just
talk
about
something?
I
don't
know.
Anything.
He's
about
my
height.
He
has
your
eyes.
What's
he
like?
You
trust
him.
He's
got
a
strength.
I'd
die
for
John
Connor.
Well,
at
least
now
I
know
what
to
name
him.
I
don't
suppose
you
know
who
the
father
is
John
never
said
much
about
him.
-
I
know
he
dies
before
the
war...
I
don't
wanna
know.
So
was
it
John
that
sent
you
here?
I
volunteered.
-
Why?
Sarah
Connor,
who
taught
her
son
to
fight,
organise,...
...prepare
from
when
he
was
a
kid.
When
you
were
in
hiding
before
the
war.
You're
talking
about
things
It's
driving
me
crazy.
Are
you
sure
you
have
the
right
person?
I'm
sure.
Come
on!
Do
I
look
like
the
mother
of
the
future?
I
mean,
am
I
tough?
Organised?
Look,
Reese,
I
didn't
ask
for
this
honour
and
I
don't
want
it.
Any
of
it.
Your
son
gave
me
a
message
to
give
to
you.
Thank
you,
Sarah,
for
your
courage
through
the
dark
years.
I
can't
help
you
with
what
you
must
soon
face
You
must
be
stronger
than
you
imagine
you
can
be.
You
must
survive
or
I
will
never
exist.
That's
all.
It's
a
good
field
dressing.
You
like
it?
It's
my
first.
Get
some
sleep.
It'll
be
light
soon.
OK.
Talk
to
me
some
more.
About
what?
Tell
me
about
where
you're
from.
All
right.
You
stay
down
by
day,
but
at
night
you
can
move
around.
You
still
have
to
be
careful
because
the
H-Ks
use
infrared.
But
they're
not
too
bright.
That's
when
the
infiltrators
started
to
appear.
The
Terminators
were
the
newest.
Traversing
your
sector
in
search
mode.
Let's
go.
-
Reese.
DN384...
Terminator!
I
was
dreaming
about
dogs.
We
use
'em
to
spot
Terminators.
Your
world
is
pretty
terrifying.
Hey,
buddy,
you
got
a
dead
cat
in
there
or
what?
Fuck
you,
asshole.
God
damn.
Thank
you.
Is
this
enough?
Yeah,
it's
enough.
-
I'm
coming.
-
With
a
kitchen.
I
am
dying
for
a
shower.
We
should
check
your
bandage,
too.
Later.
I'm
going
out
for
supplies.
Keep
this.
No,
I
can't
tell
you
where
I
am,
Mom.
Oh
but
honey.
I
need
to
know
where
I
can
reach
you.
You
tell
me
to
hide
out
here
at
the
cabin
like
I
am
worried
sick
here.
OK.
OK,
here's
the
number.
-
You
ready?
It's
408
555
1439.
Room
nine.
-
Got
it?
I
gotta
go.
I
love
you,
Mom.
I
love
you,
too,
sweetheart.
-
Tiki
Motel.
What
have
we
got?
Moth
balls.
Corn
syrup.
Ammonia.
What's
for
dinner?
-
Plastique.
What
is
it?
It's
a
nitroglycerin
base.
I
learned
to
make
it
when
I
was
a
kid.
Make
sure
there's
none
on
the
threads.
Like
this.
Screw
the
end
cap
on.
Very
gently.
You
must've
had
a
fun
childhood.
That's
good.
All
right.
He'll
find
us,
won't
he?
Probably.
It'll
never
be
over,
will
it?
Look
at
me.
I'm
shaking.
Some
legend.
No,
I'm
not.
Kyle,
the
women
in
your
time,...
...what
are
they
like?
Good
fighters.
That's
not
what
I
meant.
Was
there
someone
special?
Someone...?
A
girl,
you
know.
No.
Never.
Never?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
so
sorry.
So
much
pain.
Pain
can
be
controlled.
So
you
feel
nothing?
John
Connor
gave
me
a
picture
of
you
once.
I
didn't
know
why
at
the
time.
It
was
very
old,
torn,
faded.
You
were
young
like
you
are
now.
I
used
to
always
wonder
what
you
were
thinking
at
that
moment.
I
memorised
every
line,
every
curve.
I
came
across
time
for
you,
Sarah.
I
love
you.
I
always
have.
I
shouldn't
have
said
that.
Think
fast.
Trade
places.
Faster.
Drive
faster.
Kyle.
Oh,
my
God.
You
stay
here.
Let's
get
outta
here
man.
Get
out.
Kyle.
Come
on.
Get
up.
He's
coming!
Kyle!
Come
on.
Help
me.
Get
out.
Get
out.
Don't
stop.
Run.
Sarah.
Kyle.
We
did
it,
Kyle.
We
got
him.
No.
No.
Wait.
What
are
you
doing?
Cover,
so
he
can't
track
us.
Come
on.
Come
on.
No.
Kyle.
Come
on.
-
Come
on.
Move
it,
Reese.
On
your
feet,
soldier.
On
your
feet.
Move
it.
Get
back.
Go
back.
-
Run,
Sarah.
Run.
Run.
Come
on,
motherfucker.
No.
You're
terminated,
fucker.
Kyle.
Tape
7,
November
10.
Where
was
l?
What's
most
difficult
for
me
is
trying
to
But
I
guess
I
have
a
while
yet
before
you're
They're
more
for
me
at
this
point
just
so
that
I
can
get
it
straight.
Fill
her
up.
Should
I
tell
you
about
your
father?
Boy,
that's
a
tough
one.
Will
it
effect
your
decision
to
send
him
here,
If
you
don't
send
Kyle,
you
can
never
be.
God,
a
person
could
go
crazy
thinking
about
this.
I
suppose
I
will
tell
you.
I
owe
him
that.
Maybe
it'll
help
if...
...you
know
that
in
the
few
hours
that
we
had
together,...
...we
loved
a
lifetime's
worth.
-
What
did
he
just
say?
And
he
is
ashamed
to
ask
you
for
five
American
dollars
for
this
picture.
But
if
he
doesn't,
his
father
will
beat
him.
Pretty
good
hustle,
kid.
What
did
he
just
say?
He
said
there's
a
storm
coming
in.
I
know.
