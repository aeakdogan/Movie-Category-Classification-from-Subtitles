like

aware

even
now...

know
that
there's
nothing
sadistic...

Bill's
last
bullet
a
coma
I
was
to
lie
in
for
four
years.
When
I
woke
up,
I
went
on
what
"a
roaring
rampage
of
revenge."
I
roared,
and
I
rampaged,
and
I
got
bloody
satisfaction.
I've
killed
a
hell

a

I've
only
one
more.
The
last

wedding
rehearsal.
Now,
when
we
come
"You
may
kiss
the
bride,"
But
don't
stick
your
tongue
in
her
mouth.

This
might
be
funny
to
your
friends,
but
it
would
be
embarrassing

We'll
try
to
restrain
ourselves,
Reverend.
Y'all
got
a
song?
How
'bout
"Love
Me
Tender"?
-
Sure.
"Love
Me
Tender"
would
be
great.
Rufus
-
he's
the
man.
Rufus,
who
was
that
Rufus
Thomas.
Rufus
Thomas.
I
was
a
Drell.
I
was
a
Drifter.
I
was

of
the
Gang.
If
they

Rufus
-
he's

man.
-
Have
I
forgotten
anything?
Oh
yes,
you
forgot,
uh,

Thank
you,
Mother.
Now,
the
way
we
normally
do
this

we
have

bride's
side,
But

yeah,
they're
coming

Well,
I
don't
see
no
problem

Mother?
But,
uh...
Honey,
you
know,
it
would
be
good
You

Well,
I
don't

sorry,

Hello,
Kiddo.
-
How
did
you
find
me?
What
are
you
doing
here?
What
am
I
doing?
Well...
...moment
ago
I
was
playing
my
flute.
At
this
moment...
...I'm
looking
at
the
most
beautiful
bride
-
Why
are
you
here?
-
Are
you
gonna
be
nice?
But
I'll
do
my
best
to
be
sweet.
Hmm.
I
always
told
you...
...your
sweet
side
is
you
best
side.
I
guess
that's
why
you're
-
So
you
got
a
bun
in
the
oven.
-
I'm
knocked
up.
That
young
man
of
yours
sure
doesn't
Have
you
seen
Tommy?
-
Big
guy
in
the
tux?
Then
I
saw
him.
I
like
his
hair.
You
promised
you'd
be
nice.
No,
I
said
I'd
do
my
best.
But
you're
right.
What
does
your
young
man
He
owns
a
used
record
store
-
Ah.
Music
lover,
eh?
Aren't
we
all?
And
what
are
you
doing
I
work
in
the
record
store.
Aso.
It
all
suddenly
seems
so
clear.
-
Do
you
like
it?
I
get
to
listen
to
music
all
day...
...talk
about
music
all
day.
It's
gonna
be
a
great
environment
As
opposed
to
jetting
around
the
world,
and
being
paid
vast
sums
of
money?
Precisely.
Well,
my
old
friend...
...to
each
his
own.
However,
all
cockblockery
aside...
I
am
looking
forward

happen
to
be,
more
or
less,
-
You
want
to
come
to
the
wedding?
You'll
find
it
a
bit
lonely
on
my
side.
Your
side
always
was
a
bit
lonely.
But
I
wouldn't
sit
anywhere
else.
You
know...
...I
had
the
loveliest
dream
about
you...
Oh,
here's
Tommy!
-
You
must
be
Tommy!
Arlene's
told
me
so
much
about
you.
-
Honey,
you
OK?
Tommy,
I'd
like
you
to
meet
my
father.
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God,
this
is
great!
I'm
so
glad
to
meet
you,
sir...
uh,
Dad.
The
name's
Bill.
Well,
it's
great
to
meet
you...
Bill.
-
Arlene
told
me
you
couldn't
make
it.
That's
my
pop
for
ya.
Well,
in
the
surprise
department...
...the
apple
doesn't
fall
far
from
the
tree.
-
When
did
you
get
in?
-
Did
you
come
straight
from
Australia?
Daddy,
I
told
Tommy
that
you
were

one
could
reach

sounded
cool.
Anyhow,

was

Once

White
Lotus

whatever
it
is
that
a
man
of
Pai
Mei's
which
is
another
way
when
a
Shoaling
monk
traveling
in
the
opposite
direction.
As
the
monk
and
the
priest
...Pai
Mei...
...in
a
practically
unfathomable
gave
the
monk
the
slightest
of
nods.
The
nod...
...was
not
returned.



Now,
was
it
the
intention
Or
did
he
just
fail
to
see
The
motives
of
the
monk
What
is
known...
...were
the
consequences.



The
next
morning,
Pai
Mei
...and
demanded
that
he
offer
Pai
Mei
his
neck
The
abbot,
at
first,
Only
to
find
Pai
Mei
was...
...inconsolable.

So
began...
...the
Massacre
of
the
Shoaling
Temple,
at
the
fists
of
the
White

And...
so
began
the
legend...
...of
Pai
Mei's
Five-Point-Palm
And
what,
pray
tell,
-
Exploding-Heart
Technique?
the
deadliest
blow
in
all
of
martial
arts.
He
hits
you
with
his
fingertips...
...at
five
different
pressure
...and
then
lets
you
walk
away.
But
once
you've
taken
five
steps...
...your
heart
explodes
inside
your
body...
...and
you
fall
to
the
floor,
dead.
-
Did
he
teach
you
that?
He
teaches
no
one

Five-Point-Palm
Now...

of
the
things
...Kiddo...
...is
you
appear
So,
allow
me
to
impart
Whatever...
...whatever
Pai
Mei
says,
obey.
If
you
flash
him,
even
for
an
instant,
And
if
you
throw
any
...he'll
snap
your
back
and
your
neck
And
that
will
be
the
story
of
you.

He'll
accept
you
as
his
student.

What
happened
to
you?
-
Get
in
a
fight?
Why
did
he
accept
me?
Because
he's
a
very,
very,
very
old
man.
And

all

they
become

wish
to
die?
No.

Then
you
must
be
stupid...
Then
you
must
be
stupid...
so
stupid.
Rise,
and
let
me
look
at
your
Rise.
So
my
pathetic
friend...
What's
the
matter?
Cat
got
your
tongue?
-
Oh
yes,
you
speak
Japanese.
I
despise
the
Goddamn
Japs!
Go
to
that
rack.
Remove
the
sword.

Let's
see
how
good
you
really
are.
If...
...you
land
a
single
blow,
I'll
bow
down
and
call
you
master.




From
here
you
can
get


Your
swordsmanship...


Your
so-called
kung-fu...
is
really...
I
asked
you
to
demonstrate...
Not
a
goddamn
thing!
Let's
see
your
Tiger
Crane...









Like
all
Yankee
women...
...all
you
can
do
is
order
in
restaurants
Excruciating...
isn't
it?
Yes!
If
it
was
my
wish...
...I
could
chop
your
arm
off.
No,
please
don't!

It's
my
arm
now.
I
can
do
what
I
please.
If
you
can
stop
me...
I
suggest
you
try.

I
can't.
Because
you're
helpless?
Yes.
Have
you
ever
felt
this
before?
No.
Compared
to
me...
you're
as
helpless
YES!!!
THAT'S
THE
BEGINNING!
Is
it
your
wish
to
possess
Yes!
Your
training
will
begin...
tomorrow.

Since
your
arm
now
belongs
to
me...
...I
want
it
strong.
Can
you
do
that?
I
can,
but
not
that
close.
Then
you
can't
do
it.
What
if
your
enemy...
...What
do
you
do
then...
...Curl
into
a
ball...
...or
do
you
put
your
FIST
through
him?
Now
begin.





It's
The
Wood
That
Should
-
Not
The
Other
Way
Around.
No
Wonder
You
Can't
Do
It...
-
Before
You
Even
Begin.











If
you
want
to
eat
like
a
dog...
You
can
live
and
sleep
If
you
want
to
live
and
sleep
...pick
up
those
sticks.





Come
on,
you
bitch.

OK,
Pai
Mei.
Here
I
come.









May
I
have
a
glass
of
water,
please?

-
So
that's
a
Texas
funeral?
I
have
to
give
it
to
ya,
Budd.
That's
a
pretty
fucked
up
way
to
die.
What's
the
name
on
the
grave
Paula...
...Schultz.
Can
I
look
at
the
sword?
That's
my
money
right
there
It
sure
is.
Well
then,
it's
your
sword
now.

What's
that
you
said?
So
this
is
a
Hattori
Hanzo
sword?
That's
a
Hanzo
sword,
all
right.
Bill
tells
me
you
once
had
Yeah,
once.
Yeah?
How
does
this
one
If
you're
gonna
compare
...you
compare
it
wasn't
made
-
by
Hattori
Hanzo.

Here
you
go.
So...
...which
"R"
are
you
filled
with?
What?
They
say...
...the
number
one
killer...
...of
old
people...
...is
retirement.
People
got
a
job
to
do,
they
tend
to
live
I've
always
figured
that...
...warriors
and
their
enemies...
...share
the
same
relationship.
So
now
that
you're
not
gonna
have
on
the
battlefield...
...which
"R"
ya
filled
with?
Relief...
...or
regret?
-
A
little
bit
of
both.
I'm
sure
you
do
feel
a
little
bit
of
both.
But
I
know
damn
well
that
you
feel
one...
...more
than
you
feel
the
other.
And
the
question
was:
Regret.
You
know,
I
never
saw
anybody
buffalo
Bill
Bill
thought
she
was
so
damn
smart.
And
I
tried
to
tell
him...
...she
was
just
smart
for
a
blond.
Thanks
a
bunch.


All
Right.



Mmm.
I'm
sorry,
Budd.
That
was
rude
of
me,
wasn't
it?
Budd,
I'd
like
to
introduce
my
friend,
Black
mamba,
this
is
Budd.
You
know,
before
I
picked
I
looked
him
up
on
the
Internet.
Fascinating
creature,
the
black
mamba.
Listen
to
this:

"In
Africa,
the
saying
goes,
"'In
the
bush,
an
elephant
can
kill
you,
"'and
a
black
mamba
can
kill
you.
"and
this
has
been
true
in
Africa
Hence
its
handle,
'Death
Incarnate."'
"Its
neurotoxic
venom
is
one
of
"acting
on
the
nervous
system,
"The
venom
of
a
black
mamba
"if,
say,
bitten
on
the
ankle
or
the
thumb.
"However,
a
bite
to
the
face
or
torso
can
bring
death
from
paralysis
Now,
you
should
listen
to
this,
"The
amount
of
venom
that
can
be
can
be
gargantuan."
You
know,
I've
always
liked
I
so
rarely
have
an
opportunity
"If
not
treated
quickly
with
anti
venom,
"ten
to
15
milligrams
"However,
the
black
mamba
can
deliver
as
much
as
100
to
400
milligrams
Now...
...in
these
last
agonizing
let
me
answer
that
question
Right
at
this
moment...
...the
biggest
"R"
I
feel
is
regret.
Regret
that
maybe
met
her
end
at
the
hands
alkie,
piece
of
shit
like
you.
That
woman
deserved
better.


Bill...
...I
have
some
tragic
news.
Your
brother's
dead.
I
am
so
sorry,
baby.
She
put
a
black
mamba
in
his
camper.
I
got
her,
sweetie.
Let
me
put
it
this
way:
You
ever
start
feeling
sentimental,
When
you
get
here,
walk
into
a
florist
Then
you
take
those
flowers
on
Fuller
and
Guadalupe,
look
for
and
lay
them
on
the
grave.
'Cause
you
will
be
standing
at
the
final
-
Marty
Kitrosser?
-
Melanie
Harrhouse?
-
Beatrix
Kiddo?
Look...
I
can
be
there
Do
you
want
me
to
come
over?
No,
no,
no,
no.
OK.
I'm
leaving
now.
You
go
smoke
some
pot
or
something,



Ugh.
Gross.


Hi-ya!
"To
my
brother,
Budd.
What's
that?
Budd's
Hanzo
sword.
He
said
he
pawned
it.
Guess
that
makes
him
-
Elle?
Something
I've
always
Just
between
us
girls...
...what
did
you
say
to
Pai
Mei

Ow!
I
called
him
a
miserable
old
fool.
Ooh.
Bad
idea.
Know
what
I
did?
I
killed
that
miserable
old
fool.

How
do
you
like
the
fish
head,
I
poisoned
his
fish
heads.
Elle,
you
treacherous
dog.

I
-
give
-
you
-
my
-
word...

And
I
told
him,
"To
me,
the
word
is
worth
less
than
nothing."

That's
right.
I
killed
your
master.
And
now
I'm
gonna
kill
you,
too.
With
your
own
sword,
no
less.
Which,
in
the
very
immediate
future,
Bitch...
...you
don't
have
a
future.



Fucking
bitch!

Fucking
bitch!

I'll
kill
you!

You
bitch!
You
bitch!

I'll
fucking
kill
you,
you
bitch!


Oh,
I'll
get
you!
I'm
gonna...

Where
are
you?

Where
are
you?

You're
fucking
dead!


Oh...
shit!

Like
most
men
Bill
collected
father
figures.
The
first
was
Esteban
Vihaio.
Esteban
was
a
pimp
He
ran
a
brothel
in
Acuna,
Mexico
His
army,
the
Acuna
Boys,
made
up
of
the
fatherless
offspring
He
ran
the
Acuna
Boys.
Now,
at
the
age
of
80,
it
would
be
who
could
point
me
in
Bill's
direction.
Seor
Esteban
Vihaio?
Yes.
May
I
join
you?
Only
on
the
condition
-
May
I
join
you,
Esteban?
Americana?
Yes.
I
speak
a
little
Spanish,
if
you
prefer.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I
haven't
spoken
it
in
a
while,
but
I
would
relish
with
such
a
pretty
It's
my
pleasure
to
be
in
the
company
I
must
warn
you,
young
lady...
...I
am
susceptible
to
flattery.
How
may
I
be
of
service
to
you?
Where's
Bill?
Ahh.
You
must
be
Beatrix.
I
can
see
the
attraction.
I
remember
when
Bill
was
only
It
was
a
movie
starring
Lana
Turner.
The
Postman
Always
Ring
Twice,
And
whenever
she
would
Bill
would
begin
compulsively
to
And
I
knew
from
this
very
moment,
Mmm.
You
know...
...being
a
fool
for
a
woman
...is
always
the
right
thing
to
do.
If
we
had
met
when
I
was
...you
would
have
been
-
Well,
I'm
flattered.
This...
I
heard
you
were
driving
a
truck.
My
Pussy
Wagon
died
on
me.
The
Pussy
died.
Hmm.
Bill
shot
you
in
the
head,
no?
-
Yes.
I
would
have
been
much
nicer.
I
would
have
just
cut
your
face.
You
must
forgive
me.
Please...
you
have
a
drink
with
me.
Clara!

Coming.
Dos
aejo.

Gracias.
What
were
we
talking
about?
Bill.
-
Where's
Bill?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Bill
is
at
the
Villa
Quatro,
I
will
draw
you
a
map.
Bill
is
like
a
son
to
me.
-
Do
you
know
why
I
help
you?
Because
he
would
want
me
to.
Now,
that
I
don't
believe.
Ahh.
How
else
is
he
ever
Freeze,
Mommy.
Bang,
bang!
Oh!
Oh!
She
got
us,
B.B.
Mommy
got
us.

I'm
dying.
Fall
down,
sweetheart.
But
little
did
Quickdraw
Kiddo
know
due
to
the
fact
that
I
am
pervious
to
bullets,
Mommy.
Hey,
get
back
down
there.
So,
as
the
smirking
killer
was
a
bullet-ridden
corpse,
Bang,
bang!
You're
dead,
Mommy.
Oh!
B.B.
Oh!
B.
B...

I
should've
known.
You
are...
the
best.
Oh,
Mommy.
I
was
just
playing.
I
know.
I
told
her
that
you
were
asleep...
...but
that
one
day
you'd
wake
up
And
she
asked
me,
"If
Mommy's
then
how
will
she
know
what
I
look
like?"
To
which
I
replied,
"Because
That's
what
I
said.
Did
you
dream
of
me?
Every
single
night,
baby.
I
waited
a
long
time
Now,
let
me
look
at
you.
Oh.
My,
my,
my,
You're
pretty
too,
Mommy.
Tell
Mommy
what
you
said
Mnh-mnh.
-
Come
on,
shy
girl.
Come
on.
You
know
what
you
said.
Come
on.
Tell
Mommy.
-
Mnh-mnh.
I
said...
I
said,
"You're
the
most
beautifulest
woman
That's
the
truth.
B.B.,
don't
you
think
Mommy
has
the

Yes,
I
do.
-
What's
better
than
pretty?
Very
good.
Gorgeous.
Hmm.
You
know,
sweetie,
Why,
Daddy?
I'm
afraid
I
was.
Our
little
girl
learned
about

tell
Mommy
about
I
killed
him.
-
Emilio
was
her
goldfish.
She
came
running
into
my
room,
"Daddy.
Daddy.
And
I
said,
"Really?
That's
so
sad.
How
did
he
die?"
-
And
what
did
you
say?
Actually,
young
lady,
the
words
"I
accidentally
stepped
on
him."
To
which
I
queried,
"And
just
how
did
your
foot
accidentally
And
she
said,
"No,
no,
no.
Emilio
was
Mmm.
The
plot
thickens.
"And
just
how
did
Emilio
And
Mommy,
you
would've
been
She
didn't
lie.
She
said
she
took
Emilio
...and
put
him
on
the
carpet.
And
what
was
Emilio
Flapping.
-
And
then
you
stomped
on
him.
And
when
you
lifted
up
your
foot...
...what
was
Emilio
doing
then?
He
stopped
flapping,
didn't
he?
She
told
me
later...
...that
the
second
she
lifted
up
her
foot
and
saw
Emilio
not
flapping,
Is
that
not
the
perfect
A
fish
flapping
on
the
carpet,
So
powerful,
even
a
four-year-old
...knew
what
it
meant.
-
You
loved
Emilio,
didn't
you?
Well...
I
love
Mommy,
too.
But
I
did
to
Mommy
-
You
stomped
on
Mommy?
I
shot
Mommy.
Not
pretend
shooting
I
shot
her
for
real.
Why?
Did
you
want
to
see
No,
I
knew
what
would
happen
What
I
didn't
know
was,
when
I
shot
-
What
happened?
And
that's
when
I
learned...
...some
things,
once
you
do,
-
What
happened
to
Mommy?
You
OK,
Mommy?
No,
sweetie.
Doesn't
hurt
anymore.
Did
it
make
you
sick?
No.
It
made
me
sleep.
That's
why
I
haven't
been
with
you,
B.B.
But
you're
awake
now,
Mommy.
Right?
I'm
wide
awake,
pretty
girl.
B.B.,
would
you
like
Mommy
to
watch
Uh-huh.
Mommy,
do
you
wanna
watch
Oh,
yeah!
-
Which
one
do
you
wanna
watch?
No,
B.B.
-
Mnh-mnh.
Well,
then,
I'll
leave
you
ladies
to
it.

When
I
was
little,
He
was
the
greatest
samurai
And
he
was
the
shogun's
decapitator.
He
cut
off
the
heads
of
131
lords.
My
father
would
come
home
to
Mother
he
would
forget
about
the
killings.
He
wasn't
scared
of
the
shogun,
Maybe
that
was
the
problem.

before

revenge
I'm
gonna
ask

questions,

lies
a
dilemma.
Because

to

utterly
incapable

do

happens,
I
have
a
solution.

Aah!

Goddamn!

What
the
fuck
My
greatest
invention.
Don't
touch
it,
or
I'll

another
one
What
lies
within

dart,
just
begging

an

potent
I
call
it
"The
Undisputed
Truth."
Twice
as
strong
as

pentothal,
Except
for
a
slight
wave
of
euphoria.
-
Euphoria?
-
No.
As
you
know...
...I'm
quite
keen
on
comic
books.
Especially
the
ones
about
superheroes.
I
find
the
whole
mythology
Take
my
favorite
superhero,
Superman.
Not
a
great
comic
book.
Mmm.
But
the
mythology...
The
mythology
is
not
only
great,
How
long
does
this
shit
take
About
two
minutes.
Just
long
enough
Now,
a
staple
of
the
superhero
there's
the
superhero
Batman
is
actually
Bruce
Wayne,
When
that
character
wakes
up
He
has
to
put
on
a
costume
And
it
is
in
that
characteristic
Superman
didn't
become
Superman.
Superman
was
born
Superman.
When
Superman
wakes
up
His
alter
ego
is
Clark
Kent.
His
outfit
with
the
big
red
"S"
-
that's
the
blanket
he
was
wrapped
in
Those
are
his
clothes.
What
Kent
wears

the
glasses,
That's
the
costume
Superman
wears
Clark
Kent
is
how
Superman
views
us.
And
what
are
the
characteristics
He's
weak...
...he's
unsure
of
himself...
...he's
a
coward.
Clark
Kent
is
Superman's
critique
Sorta
like
Beatrix
Kiddo
Aso.
The
point
emerges.
You
would've
worn
the
costume
But
you
were
born
Beatrix
Kiddo.
And
every
morning
when
you
woke
up,
Oh,
you
can...
take
the
needle
out.
Are
you
calling
me
a
superhero?
I'm
calling
you
a
killer.
A
natural
born
killer.
You
always
have
been,
Moving
to
El
Paso...
...working
in
a
used
record
store...
...going
to
the
movies
with
Tommy...
...clipping
coupons.
That's
you...
...trying
to
disguise
yourself
That's
you
trying
to
blend
in
with
the
hive.
But
you're
not
a
worker
bee.
You're
a
renegade
killer
bee.
And
no
matter
how
much
beer
you
drank
or
how
fat
your
ass
got,
nothing
in
the
world
First
question:
Did
you
really
think
your
life
in
El
Paso
No!
But
I
would've
had
B.B.!
Don't
get
me
wrong.
I
think
you
would
have
been
But
you
are
a
killer.
All
those
people
you
killed
to
get
to
me...
...felt
damn
good,
didn't
they?
Yes.
Every
single
one
of
them?
Yes.
That
was
the
warm-up
round.
Now
comes
the
$64,000
question.
Why
did
you
run
away
Do
you
remember
the
last
assignment
Of
course.
Lisa
Wong.
The
morning
I
left,
I
was
sick.
On
the
plane,
I
threw
up.
So
I
started
thinking:
Maybe
I
was
pregnant.

What
I
didn't
know...
...was
that
somewhere
on
my
journey
With
me
in
L.A.,
it
didn't
take
Lisa
Wong
-


Hello,
I'm
Karen
Kim.
I
have
a
welcome
gift
Oh,
that's
nice.
Um...
Can
you
just
leave
it
by
the
door?
-
You
pretty
good
with
that
shotgun?
but
I'm
a
fucking
surgeon
Well,
guess
what,
bitch?
-
And
I
got
you
right
in
my
sight.
Not
before
I
put
one
Karen...
...I
just
found
out...
...right
now...
...not
a
moment
before
...that
I'm
pregnant.
On
the
floor
by
the
door...
...is
a
strip
that
says
I'm
pregnant.
Bullshit.
Any
other
time
This
time...
...you're
100
percent
wrong.
I'm
the
deadliest
woman
in
the
world.
But
right
now...
...I'm
just
scared
shit-less
for
my
baby.
Please.
Just
look
at
the
strip.
Please.
Stay
where
you
are
and
don't
move.
I
don't
know
what
this
fucking
shit
means.
The
box
with
the
directions
-
"Easy
to
use.
Remove
the
cap
and
urinate
Blue
means
pregnant.
I'll
read
it
myself,
thank
you.
Oh,
OK.
Say
I
were
to
believe
you.
Just
go
home.
I'll
do
the
same.

Congratulations.

Before
that
strip
turned
blue...
...I
was
a
woman,
I
was
your
woman.
I
was
a
killer
who
killed
for
you.
Before
that
strip
turned
blue,
onto
a
speeding
train.
For
you.
But
once
that
strip
turned
blue...
...I
could
no
longer
do
Not
anymore.
Because
I
was
gonna
be
a
mother.
Can
you
understand
that?
Yes.
But
why
didn't
you...
...tell
me
then,
instead
of
now?
Once
you
knew,
you'd
claim
her.
And
I
didn't
want
that.
Not
your
decision
to
make.
Yes.
But
it's
the
right
decision,
She
deserved
to
be
born
But
with
you...
...she
would've
been
born
I
had
to
choose.
I
chose
her.
You
know,
five
years
ago,
if
I
had
to
make
a
list
of
impossible
you
performing
a
coup
de
grce
on
me
...would've
been
right
I'd
have
been
wrong,
wouldn't
I?
I-I'm
sorry.
Was
that
a
question?
Of
impossible
things
yes,
in
this
instance,
Well?
When
you
never
came
back,
I
naturally
assumed
Lisa
Wong,
Oh!
And
for
the
record...
...letting
somebody
think
somebody
is
quite
cruel.
I
mourned
you
for
three
months.
And
in
the
third
month
of
mourning
you...
...I
tracked
you
down.
I
wasn't
trying
to
track
you
down.
I
was
trying
to
track
down
So
I
find
you...
...and
what
do
I
find?
Not
only
are
you
not
dead...
...you're
getting
married
And
you're
pregnant.
I
overreacted.
You
overreacted?
I
didn't
say
I
was
gonna
explain
myself.
I
said
I
was
gonna
tell
you
the
truth.
But
if
that's
too
cryptic,
let's
get
literal.
I'm
a
killer.
I'm
a
murdering
bastard.
And
there
are
consequences...
...to
breaking
the
heart
You
experienced
some
of
them.
Was
my
reaction
really
that
surprising?
Yes.
It
was.
Could
you
do
what
you
did?
Of
course
you
could.
But
I
never
thought
you
would,
I'm
really
sorry,
Kiddo...
...but
you
thought
wrong.
You
and
I
have
unfinished
business.
Baby...
you
ain't
kidding.

you

'Course

did.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
I
don't
know.
Because
I'm...
...a
bad
person.
No.
You're
not
a
bad
person.
You're
a
terrific
person.
You're
my
favorite
person.
But
every
once
in

can
be

do
I
look?
You
look
