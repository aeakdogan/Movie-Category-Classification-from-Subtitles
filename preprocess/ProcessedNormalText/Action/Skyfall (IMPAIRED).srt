for
Ronson,
It's

I
wasn't

would
fall
And

But
what
did
you
do
then?
Throw

Burn

No...
You
just

they
begin
And

they

And
then

You
take
them
And
now

Guess
the
point,

Well,
everyone
needs
a
hobby.
So
what's
yours?
Resurrection.
Let
me
show
you
something.
Tells
a
story,
doesn't
it?
They
left
the
island
so
quickly
that
couldn't
decide
what
to
take
And
this
every
day
reminds
me
There
is
nothing...
When
a
thing
is
redundant,
Fifty
years
old
McClellan.
A
particular
favourite
of
yours,
So...
what's
the
toast?
To
the
women
we
love?
Darling...
Darling,
No,
no,
no,
no...
Stand
up
straight,
and
whatever
you
do,
Don't
lose
your
head.
Don't
lose
your
head.
Time
to
redeem
Let's
see.
You
can
be
the
first...
to
knock
the
gloss
And
just
to
be
sporting,
Let's
see
Oh,
can't
believe
it.
Can't
believe
it.
Did
you
really
die
that
day?
Is
there
any,
My
turn.
I
win.
So
waste
of
good

What
are

Take
me
back
to

You
are

Well,
as
I
bet
you
remember
Strange,
for
me
it
feels
just...
-
Are
you
surprised?
But
then
you
always
were
Maybe
that's
why
-
You
flatter
yourself.
Just
as
I
can
imagine
it.
Regret
is
unprofessional.
"Regret
is
unprofessional"...
They
kept
for
five
months
They
tortured
me.
And
I
isnt
protected
your
secrets.
But
they
made
me
suffer...
and
suffer...
and
suffer.
Until
I
realized...
it
was
you...
You
betrayed
me.
So
I
had
only
one
thing
left.
My
cyanide
capsule
You
remember,
right?
So
I
broke
the
tooth...
and
bit
into
the
capsule.
Burned
all
my
insights...
but
I
didn't
die.
Life
clamed
to
me
And
then...
I
understood...
why
I
had
survived.
I
needed
to
look
in
your
eyes
Well,
I
hope
it
was
worth
it.
Mr.
Silva...
you
are
going
to

you
will
be

I
know
you
remember
it.
Your
name
is

I
will
have
it
struck
off.
Soon,

be

I
got
six

and
a

ma'am.
I
want

seems
to
me

then.

see
what

No.

Isn't
that

quaint?
Well,
I

the
truth
is
that
I'm
frightened
because

They
do
not

They're

They
are

But
look
around

you
see
a

It's

It's
in

That's
where
we
must
So,
before
you
declare

you

Just
one
more
thing
to

My

And,
um...
I
suppose
some
of
it
sunk
in,
despite
my
best
intentions.
And

I
think,

We
are
not

that
strength
which
in

days
That
which
we
are,

One

Made
weak
by
time
and
fate,
but
strong
in

to
strive,
to

to

not
to

Move.
Move.
Move.
