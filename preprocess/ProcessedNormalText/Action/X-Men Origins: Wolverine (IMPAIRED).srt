He...
He

Son.
What

He

We're

And

You

KAYLA:
What's

Stryker

Don't
worry.
I
said
no.
Why
is
he
bothering
you
Because
I'm
the
best
there
is
at
what
I

but
what
I
do
best
isn't
very
nice.
You're
not

Logan.
A
gift.
You

Come

Stay

Big
temper,

So
pIease

How'd

FemaIe

It's

Oh,
I

WeII,
you
didn't
stay
in
the
car,
did
you?

KAYLA:
Why

Why?
-Because
she
used

-You

His

was
Kuekuatsheu
-Oh,

And

And

But
he
can

Wow.
Koo-koo-ka-choo

''Kuekuatsheu.''

It

Why?
Why?

You

Stay

STRYKER:

Six

No

I
tried
to
warn
you.
Why
didn't
you

-Why?
Victor's

Went
AWOL.
You

So
what's
your

Captain?
You
can't
beat
him,
Logan,
I'm
gonna
find
him
and
kiII

I
can
give

him.
And
we

Of

What's
the
isIand?

It's
where
Stryker
takes
Wait,

Takes

Mutants.
Rumor
is
that
Stryker's
doing

wondered
I
tried
not
to.
They
kiIIed
her
so
I'd

They
kiIIed
her
for
a
goddamn
experiment.
-Where

it?
Where

But
a

-Who?
He

What's

He's
taking

powers.
That's

Logan.
That's
aII
I
know.
If
I
have
to
come
back
here,
I'm
coming
with
you,
Logan.
-There's
no
redemption
where
I'm
going.


There's
our

That's
cooI.
I'm
gonna

And
your

ReaIIy?
Worked

You
shouIdn't

done
that,
before
Logan
even
gets
a
chance.
So
what
brings
you
to
our
fair
city,
sir?
Victor
Creed.
And
who's
that?
The
man
I'm
gonna

He
works

a
man
named
Stryker
-Just

Ooh!

Never

Those

The

Do

I'm

head
off.
See
if
that
works.

You're
getting
sIow,
oId
man.

You
son
of
a
bitch.
You're
gonna
die
for
what
you
did
to
her.
Victor!
WeII,
that's
a
nice
stick.
Okay,
shithead,
here's
the

After
20
years
of
working
with
mutants,
We
can
win
this
war
before

starts
Pre-emptive
action

The
days
of
our
country
We
need
to
take
the
fight
to
the
enemy
-I
admire
your
passion,
I
do.
But
this
is
as
far
as
it
goes.
-Weapon
X
was
a
hiccup.
We
know
he's
a
mutant,
-You
shouIdn't
have
kept
that
from
us.
That
has
nothing
BuIIshit.
You're
too
cIose
to
this.
Okay.
You're
right.
I
won't
Iie
to
you.
My
son
did
bring
but
I
took
an
oath
to
protect
the
American
peopIe
from
every
threat,
both
foreign

and
domestic.
-You
don't
Iike
fIying,
huh?
-Just
concentrate
on
what
you're
doing.
You
got
a
bit
of
sweat
Very
funny.
Just
keep
your
eyes
on
the...
On
the
what?
The
cIouds?
You're
up
and
down
-Where'd
you
get
this
thing,
anyway?
I
won
her
in
a
game.
Jacks
over
fives.
Great.
REMY:
ReIax.
We're
aImost
there.
There
it
is.
The
isIand.
Three
MiIe
IsIand.
Hiding
in
pIain
sight.
No
one's
gonna
snoop
They
think
it's
gonna
turn
them
-Like
you?
AII
right.
You
ready?
About
time.
Hey,
if
it
makes
you
feeI
any
better,
WeII,
yeah,

Oh,

How

Everything

-And

to
my
commands?
Logan.
WeIcome
back
to
the
war.
Before
I
gut
you,
I
want
to
know
why.
I
needed
your
powers
for
the
PooI.
-For
the
what?
DeadpooI.
Years
of
searching
and
refining,
finding
the
right
powers
without
ripping
it
apart.
My
son
was
the
first
piece
of
the
puzzIe.
Logan,
you
were
the
Iast.
You
made
Weapon
XI
possibIe.
I
asked
you
to
heIp,
WeII,
I've
Iearned
that
nothing
motivates
Who
are
you?
Oh,
she's
reaI,
oId
friend.

Did
you
reaIIy
think
You're
a
dangerous
man.
We
Iike
to
keep
an
eye
on
dangerous
men.
TeII

about
the
day
you
died.
They
gave
me
a
shot
It
reduces
the
heart
rate
so
Iow

Don't
be
angry
with
her.
She's
a
reaI
credit

Did

Quite
a
usefuI

It
was
never
reaI,
my
friend.
It
was
reaI
for
me.
I
toId
you
if
you
came
down
this
road,
That
story
you
toId
me
about
a
man
I
had
it
backwards.
I
thought
you
were
the
moon
But
you're
the
trickster,
aren't
you?
I'm
just
the
fooI
who
got
pIayed.
The
worst
part
of
it
is,
But
I
ignored
my
instincts.
I
ignored
what
I
reaIIy
am.
But
that
won't
ever
happen
again.
-CoIoneI?
I've
done
everything
you've
asked.
My
sister.
You
said
if
I
heIped
you,
you'd
Iet
her
go.
KayIa,
it's
not
as
simpIe
as
that.
We
just
need

VICTOR:

never
survive
the
operation.

take
anything
he
can.
You're
my
favorite
soIdier,
Victor.
He's
using
us.

How
