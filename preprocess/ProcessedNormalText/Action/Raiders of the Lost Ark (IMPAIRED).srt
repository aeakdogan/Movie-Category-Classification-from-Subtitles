He

good.
Seor,

Please...
Seor.

Stop.
Stay
out
of
the

Forrestal.

SATIPO:
Let
us
hurry.
That's
what
scares
me.
Stay
here.
If
you
insist,

Give

No

Throw

Give

Adis,

Adis,
Satipo.


Dr.
Jones.
Again
we
see
there
is
nothing
which
I
cannot
take
away.
And
you
thought
I
had
given
up.
You
chose
the
wrong
friends.
Too
bad
the
Hovitos
Yes,
too
bad.
You
could
warn
them,





Jock!
Start
the

Get
it
up!
Jock,
the

Start
the

Jock!

There's
a

in
the

Jock!
Oh,
that's
just
I
hate
snakes,

I
hate
'em!
Come

All
right,
let's
get
back
to

also
demonstrates...
...one
of
the

No,
I'm
talking
about
folklore.
In
this
case,
that
there
was
a

coffin
and
this
accounts
for
the
holes
and
the
generally
poor
condition
However,

the

in

give
us
a

...reason
to
da...
uh,

as
we
have.

Um...
Any
questions,
then?
No?
Okay,
that's
it

I

I
had
it
in

What
happened?

-

Not
at

I'm
sure
everything

It's
beautiful,
Marcus.
I
can

Look...
Listen
to
me,

I
brought

Look.
I
got
these

They're
good

Marcus.
-
Look.
Yes,
the

will
buy

Yes,
they
are

waiting.

They
knew
you
were
coming
Seem
to
know
everything.
They
wouldn't
tell
me
Well,
what
do
I
want
What
am
I,
in
trouble?
EATON:
Yes,
Dr.
Jones,
we've
heard
a
great
deal
INDY:
Have
you?
Uh,
professor
of
archeology,
expert
on
the
occult,
and,
uh,
how
does
one
say
it?
Obtainer
of
rare
antiquities.
That's
one
way
of
saying
it.
Why
don't
you
sit
down?
-
Oh,
thank
you.
Yes,
you're
a
man
Now,
you
studied
at
the
University
of
Chicago.
Yes,
I
did.
You
have
no
idea
Uh...
well,
just
rumors,
really.
Somewhere
in
Asia,
I
think.
I
haven't
really
spoken
We
were
friends,
but,
uh...
had
a
bit
of
a
falling
out,
Mmm.
Dr.
Jones,
now,
that
this
is
all
I
understand.
Uh...

Yesterday
afternoon,
intercepted
a...
that
was
sent

Now,
to
Cairo...
the
Nazis
have
had
teams
running
around
the
world
looking
Hitler's
a
nut
on
the
subject.
He's
crazy.
He's
obsessed
with
the
occult.
And,
right
now,
apparently,
there's
some
kind
going
on
in
the

Now,
we've
got

EATON:
Just
what
does
Well,
it...
The
city
of
Tanis
is
one
of
the
possible
The
Lost
Ark?
Yeah,
the
Ark
of
the
Covenant.
The
chest
the
Hebrews
used
to
carry
around
What
do
you
mean,
You
talking
Yes,
the

The

brought
down

you
believe
Any
of
you
guys
-
Well,
I...
The
Hebrews
took
and
put
them
in
the
Ark.
they
put
the
Ark
in
a
place
In
Jerusalem.
Where
it
stayed
for
many
years.
Until,
all
of
a
sudden,
Where?
Well,
nobody
knows
However,
an
Egyptian
pharaoh...
-
Shishak.
...invaded
the
city
of
Jerusalem
and
he
may
have
taken
the
Ark
and
hidden
it
called
the
Well
of
Souls.
Secret
chamber?
BRODY:
However,
about
a
year
after
the
pharaoh
the
city
of
Tanis
was
in
a
sandstorm
which
Wiped
clean
by
the
wrath
of
God.
Uh-huh.
Obviously,
we've
come
Now
you
seem
to
know,
uh,
all
about
this
Tanis,
then.
No,
no,
not
really.
Ravenwood
is
the
real
expert.
Abner
did
the
first
serious
work
Collected
some
of
its
relics.
It
was
his
obsession,
really.
But
he
never
found
the
city.
Frankly,
we're
somewhat
An
American
being
mentioned
in
a
secret
Nazi
cable.
Oh,
rubbish.
Well,
what
do
the
Nazis
Well,
obviously,
for
the
headpiece
and
they
think
Abner's
got
it.
What
exactly
is
a
headpiece
Well,
the
staff
I
don't
know,
about
this
big,
nobody
really
knows
And
it's...
it's,
uh...
with
an
elaborate
headpiece...
in
the
shape
of
the
sun,
And
what
you
did
was
you
take
the
staff
A
map
room
with
a
miniature
of
the
city
all
laid
out
and
if
you
put
the
staff
at
a
certain
time
of
day,
and
made
a
beam
that
came
down
and
gave
you
the
exact
location
Where
the
Ark
of
the

Which
is
exactly
what
the
Nazis
What
does
this
Ark
look
like?
Uh...
INDY:
There's
a
picture
of
it
That's
it.
EATON:
Good
God.
Yes,
that's
just
Uh...
now,
what's
that
supposed
to
be
INDY:
Lightning...
fire...
power
of
God
or
something.
EATON:
I'm
beginning
to
understand
Hitler's
interest
in
this.
BRODY:
Oh,
yes.
The
Bible
speaks
of
the
and
laying
waste
An
army
which
carries
is
invincible.
You
did
it,
didn't
you?
They
want
you
to
go
for
it.

Oh,
Marcus!
They
want
you
to
get
a
hold
of
and
they're
prepared
And
the
museum?
The
museum
gets
the
Ark
Oh,
yes.
Oh...
The
Ark
of
the
Covenant.
Nothing
else
has
come
close.
That
thing
represents
everything
we
got
into
archeology
Mmm!
You
know,
five
years
ago,
I'm
really
rather
envious.
I've
got
to
locate
Abner.
I
think
I
know
where
to
start.
Suppose
she'll
Possibly,
but...
Marion's
the
least
believe
me,
Indy.
What
do
you
mean?
Well,
I
mean
that
man
has
been
searching
Not
something
to
be
taken
No
one
knows
its
secrets.
It's
like
nothing
you've
ever

Oh,
Marcus.
What
are
you
trying
to
do,
You
sound
like
my
mother.
We've
known
each
other
I
don't
believe
in
magic,
I'm
going
after
a
find
of
incredible
You're
talking
Besides,
you
know
Nice
to
see
you
again,
Thank
you.

Shh...
shh...

Shh...





Give
him
space!
Go
on,
Regan!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!



INDY:
Hello,
Marion.

Indiana
Jones.

Always
knew,
someday,
you'd
come
walking
back
I
never
doubted
that.
Something
made
it
inevitable.
So,
what
are
you
doing
here
I
need
one
of
the
pieces
I
learned
to
hate
you
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you.
I
was
a
child.
I
was
in
love.
It
was
wrong
and
you
knew
it!
You
knew
what
you
were
doing.
Now
I
do!
Get
out!

I
did
what
I
did.
You
don't
have
to
be
happy
but
maybe
we
could
help
I
need
one
of
the
pieces
Bronze
piece,
about
this
size,
with
a
hole
in
it,
off-center,
You
know
the
one
I
mean?
Yeah.
I
know
it.
Where's
Abner?
Where's
Abner?
Abner's
dead.
Marion,
I'm
sorry.
Do
you
know
what
you
did
to
me,
I
can
only
say
Well,
say
it
again,
anyway.
Sorry.
Yeah,
everybody's
sorry.
Abner
was
sorry
for
dragging
me
looking
I'm
sorry
to
still
be
Everybody's
sorry
for
something.
INDY:
It's
a
worthless
bronze
You
going
to
give
it
to
me?
Maybe.
I
don't
know
where
it
is.
Well,
maybe
you
could
find
it.
3,000
bucks.
Well,
that
will
get
me
back,
I
can
get
you
another
two
It's
important,
Marion.
Trust
me.
You
know
the
piece
I
mean?
Do
you
know
where
it
is?
Come
back
tomorrow.
Why?
Because
I
said
so,
that's
why.
Ha!
See
you
tomorrow,
Indiana
Jones.

Good
evening,
Frulein.
MARION:
The
bar's
closed.

We...
We
are...
not
thirsty.
What
do
you
want?
The
same
thing
your
friend
Surely
he
told
you
other
interested
parties.
Must've
slipped
his
mind.
The
man
is...
nefarious.
I
hope,
for
your
sake,
Why,
are
you
willing
Oh,
almost
certainly.
Do
you
still
have
it?

No.
But
I
know
where
it
is.
Hey,
how
about
a
drink
Your
fire
is
dying
here.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
Listen,
Herr
Mac...
I
don't
know
what
kind
of
people
but
nobody
tells
me
Frulein
Ravenwood,
let
me
show
you

MARION:
Take
your
hands
off
me!

Take
your
lousy
hands
off!

Wait
a
minute.
Wait,
I...
I
can
be
reasonable.
That
time
is
passed.
You
don't
need
that.

Wait...
I'll
tell
you
everything.

Yes,
I
know
you
will.

Let
her
go.



Whiskey.

Shoot
them.
Shoot
them
both.




My
medallion!
MARION:
Well,
Jones,
at
least
how
to
show
a
lady
a
good
time!
Boy,
you're
something!
Yeah,
I'll
tell
you
what.
Until
I
get
back
my
$5,000,
you're
going
to
get
more
I'm
your
goddamn
partner!
Cairo,
city
of
the
living.
A
paradise
on
earth.

Silence!
Why
do
you
forget
yourselves?
-
What
is
this?
Where
did
this
animal
come
from?
Oh...
oh,
no.


Cute.
What
an
adorable
creature.
Then
it
shall
be
welcome
Oh,
well,
no,
you
don't
have
to
INDY:
I
knew
the
Germans
You're
the
best
digger
in
Egypt.
My
services
are
entirely
They've
hired
or
shanghaied
The
excavation
is
enormous.
They
hire
only
strong
backs
It's
as
if
the
pharaohs
When
did
they
find
the
map
room?
Three
days
ago.
They
have
not
one
brain
Except
one.
He
is
very
clever.
What's
his
name?
They
call
him
"Bellosh."
Belloq.
Belloq.
The
Germans
have
They
are
near
to
discovering
Well,
they're
not
Who
can
tell
us
Perhaps
a
man
I
know
Indy...
there
is
something
What
is
it?
The
Ark.
If
it
is
there,
at
Tanis,
then
it
is
something
that
Death
has
always
surrounded
it.
It
is
not
of
this
earth.
Do
we
need
the
monkey,
huh?
I'm
surprised
at
you,
Jones,
talking
that
way
about
our
baby.
He's
got
your
looks,
too.
And
your
brains.
Oops!
I
noticed
that.
She's
a
smart
little
thing.

-
Hey!
Hey,
where
you
going?
She'll
be
all
right.
Come
on.
Come
on.
-
Okay...
What's
this?
It's
a
date.
You
eat
'em.




MARION:
How
come
you
haven't
found
raise
eight
or
nine
kids,
INDY:
Who
says
I
haven't?

I
do.
Dad
had
you
figured
He
said
you
were
a
bum.
Oh,
he's
being
generous.
The
most
gifted
bum
You
know,
he
loved
you
Took
a
hell
of
a
lot
Not
much,
just
you.
Marion,
get
out
of
here!
Duck!



Right.



Shh!
Shh!
Marion!

MARION:
Help!
Over
here,
Indy!
INDY:
Get
out
of
the
way!
Move!
Move
it!
MARION:
Help
me!
You
can't
do
this
to
me!
I'm
an
American!

Indy!
Indiana
Jones!
Help
me,
Jones!

MARION:

Jones!
Marion!

Indy!





INDY:
Marion...

MAN:
Dr.
Jones.

You
looking
for
me?

Belloq.
Good
afternoon,
Dr.
Jones.
I
ought
to
kill
you
right
now.
Not
a
very
private
place
Well,
these
Arabs
don't
care
They're
not
going
It
was
not
I
who
brought
Please,
sit
down
We
can
at
least
behave
I
see
your
taste
in
friends
How
odd
that
it
should
end
after
so
many
I
almost
regret
it.
Where
shall
I
find
so
close
to
my
own
level?
Try
the
local
sewer.
You
and
I
are
very
much
alike.
Archeology
is
our
religion,
yet
we
have
both
fallen
Our
methods
have
not
differed
I
am
a
shadowy
It
would
take
only
a
nudge
to
push
you
out
of
the
light.
Now
you're
getting
nasty.
You
know
it's
true.
How
nice.
Look
at
this.
It's
worthless.
Ten
dollars
But
I
take
it,
I
bury
it
in
the
sand
it
becomes
priceless...
Men
will
kill
for
it.
Men
like
you
and
me.
What
about
your
boss,
I
thought
he
was
waiting
All
in
good
time.
When
I
am
finished
with
it.
Jones,
do
you
realize
It's
a
transmitter.
It's
a
radio
And
it's
within
my
reach.
You
want
to
talk
to
God?
Let's
go
see
Him
together.
I've
got
nothing
better
to
do.
CHILD:
Uncle
Indy,

Uncle
Indy!
Next
time,
Indiana
Jones,
it'll
take
more
than
children
Uncle
Indy!
I
thought
I
would
Better
than
the
United
Marion's
dead.
-
Yes,
I
know.
I'm
sorry.
Life
goes
on,
Indy.
There
is
the
proof.

Uh-oh.
I
have
much
to
tell
you.
First
we
will
take
them
home,
and
then
I
will
take
you
INDY:
I
can't
figure
out
Where'd
he
get
a
copy
There
are
no
pictures,
I
tell
you
only
what
I
saw
A
headpiece
like
that
one,
except
round
the
edges,
In
the
center,
the
Frenchman
and...
and
surrounding
there
were
raised
markings,
They
made
their
calculations
SALLAH:
This
morning.
Belloq
and
the
boss
German,
When
they
came
out
they
gave
us
a
new
spot
out
away
from
the
camp.
The
Well
of
the
Souls,
huh?
Come,
come,
look.
Sit
down.
Come,
sit
down.
What
is
it?
This
is
a
warning
not
to
disturb
What
about
the
height
Did
Belloq
get
it
off
of
here?
Yes.
It
is
here.
This
were
the
old
way,
this
mean
six
kadam
high.
-
About
72
inches.
"And
take
back

said
their

Are
you
absolutely
sure?
Belloq's

is
too
long.

They're
digging

I
am

I
told
you
not
to
be
premature
in
your
communiqu
to
Berlin.
Archeology
is
not
It
does
not
deal
The
Fhrer
is
not
He
demands
constant
reports,
You
led
me
to
believe...
Nothing!
I
only
said
Besides,
with
the
information
my
calculations
were
correct.
INDY:
Boy,
they're
not
kidding,
What
time
does
the
sun
SALLAH:
At
about
9:00
in
the
morning.
INDY:
Not
much
time,
then.
Where
are
they
digging
SALLAH:
On
that
ridge...
INDY:
Let's
go,
come
on.


Sallah.
Sallah!
They're
here.

Please,
my
friend,
I
fetch
the
water.
If
you
want
water,
No
problem,
no
problem.

I
thought
you
were
dead.
You
must
have
switched
baskets.

Are
you
hurt?
No.
You
have
to
get
me
They're
gonna
be
back
Cut
me
loose.
Quick.
They
keep
asking
about
you.
What's
wrong?
Cut
me
loose.
I
know
where
the
Ark
is,
Marion.
The
Ark's
here?
I'm
coming
with
you,
Jones.
Cut
me
loose!
If
I
take
you
out
of
here
now,
they'll
start
combing
Jones,
you've
got
to
get
me
Come
on,
Jones,
are
you
crazy?
Marion,
I
hate
to
do
this,
but
if
you
don't
sit
this
whole
thing
I'll
be
back
to
get
you.
Jones,
what's
the
matter?

That's
it.
Who
knows?
Perhaps
the
Ark
is
still
waiting
in
some
antechamber
Perhaps
there's
some
vital
-
Perhaps...
My
feeling
exactly.
She
was
in
possession
She
may
know
much,
I
tell
you,
I'm
surprised
That
is
not
your
reputation.
But
it
needn't
concern
you.
I
have
the
perfect
man
Heil
Hitler.



SALLAH:
Indy!
Here!
We've
hit
stone!
INDY:
Clear
it
off.
Come
on,
find
the
edges.

SALLAH:
Good,
good,
good.
You
see,
Indy?
You
see?
Okay,
bring
the
pry
bars
in.
As
a
team,
boys!
As
a
team!
Push!

INDY:
Get
'em
in
there.
Good,
good,
that's
it.
Watch
your
toes.

SALLAH:
Carefully,
carefully!

Sorry,
Indy.
Indy...
why
does
the
floor
move?
Give
me
your
torch.
Snakes.
Why
did
it
have
to
be
snakes?
Asps.
Very
dangerous.
You
go
first.


If
you're
trying
the
desert
is
three
weeks
so
please,
eat
something.
I
must
apologize
Yeah.
Whose
idea
was
it?
No
food,
no
water.
What
kind
of
people
At
this
particular
time
they
are
necessary
evils.
They're
not
my
friends.
However,
with
the
even
in
this
part
of
the
world,
we
are
not
entirely
uncivilized.

It's
beautiful.
I
would
very
much
like

I'll
bet
you
would.
All
right.
What
do
you
got
to
drink
We
don't
have
much
time.
Soon
they
will
come
to
harm
you,
and
I
will
not
be
able
unless
you
are
able
to
placate
them.
Some,
uh,
piece
which
I
can
use
MARION:
I've
already
told
you
I
have
no
loyalty
to
Jones.
He's
brought
me
Marion,
you
are
beautiful.
I
don't
think
SALLAH:
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
Carefully,
carefully!
You
all
right,
Indy?

SALLAH:
Now
gently,
boys.
Whoa...


I
told
you
it
will
be
all
right.
Huh...

Sallah,
get
down
here!
You
pour.



Oh,
that's
good.

Whoops.
What
is
this
stuff,
Ren?
I
grew
up
with
this.
It's
my
family
label.
Well...
I
have
to
be
I
like
you,
Ren,
very
much.
Perhaps
we'll
meet
someday
We
meet
again,
Frulein.
You
Americans,
Always
overdressing
Now...
what
shall
we
talk
about?
INDY:
All
right...
take
it
up!
Easy!
You're
as
stubborn
as
that
girl.
TOHT:
You
like
her
too
much,
I
think.
BELLOQ:
Your
methods
of
archeology
You
would
use
a
bulldozer
to
find
a...
Colonel!
Wake
your
men!
Indy,
the
torches
Go
on,
get
out
of
here.
Hyah!

-
Sallah!
Hello!
Why,
Dr.
Jones,
in
such
a
nasty
place?
Why
don't
you
come
on
down
here!
Thank
you,
my
friend,
but
I
think
we
are
all
That's
right,
isn't
it?

Yes,
we
are
very
comfortable
So,
once
again,
Jones,
what
was
briefly
yours
What
a
fitting
end
You're
about
to
become
to
this
archeological
find.
Who
knows?
In
a
thousand
years,

Son
of
a
bitch.
DIETRICH:
I'm
afraid
we
must
be
Our
prize
is
awaited
in
Berlin.
But
I
do
not
wish
to
leave
you
down
in
that
awful
place
MARION:
Slimy
pig,
you
let
me
go!
Stop
it!

Marion!
INDY:
Hang
on.
Don't...
-
Indy!
Marion,
I
got
you!

You
traitor!



Snakes!
Oh,
sh...
oh,
at
your
feet!
The
girl
was
mine!
She's
of
no
use
to
us.
Only

I
wonder
sometimes,
monsieur,
if
you

You
bastards!
Indiana
Jones...
adieu.


No!

Take
this.
Wave
it
at
anything
MARION:
Thank
you.
Oh,
my
God,
this
whole
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where
did
you
get
this?
I
was
trying
to
escape.
No
thanks
to
you.
How
hard
were
you
trying?
Well,
where
the
hell
were
you?
INDY:
Watch
it,
watch
it.
-
MARION:
What
are
you
doing?
How
the
hell
are
we
going
I'm
working
on
it!
Well,
whatever
you're
Ah...
Where
are
you
going?
Through
that
wall.
Just
get
ready
to
run,
MARION:
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
Indy!
Damn
it!
Don't
you
leave
me


MARION:
Indy!
Here
we
go!
Get
ready!
Indy,
the
torch
is
going
out!


Indy?







Marion!
Look.
Look.



They're
going
to
fly
it
When
that
Ark
gets
loaded,
we're
already
going
Ah,
monsieur,
let
us
toast
To
the
Ark.
When
we
are
very
far
That
will
do.





Hey,
you
now...
Come
here!
Come
here!





Indy!

Stay
with
the
Ark!
Look
out!
Oh,
my
God.
Marion.
MARION:
In
here!
Up
here!
Indy,
come
on!
INDY:
Pull
on
the
latch!
MARION:
Move
up!
It's
stuck!
Indy!
I
can't
force
the
lock!

It's
stuck!
-
Turn
it!
Turn
it!
Turn
it
there!
Never
mind!

DIETRICH:
Get
the
Ark
away
from
Have
it
put
on
the
truck.
We'll
fly
it
out
of
Cairo.
And
Gobler,
I
want
Jones.

Holy
smoke,
my
friends,
I...
I'm
so
pleased
Indy,
Indy,
we
have
no
time.
If
you
still
want
the
Ark,
it
is
being
loaded
Truck?
What
truck?

Let's
go!
Get
back
to
Cairo.
Get
us
some
transport
boat,
plane,
anything.
Meet
me
at
Omar's.
I'm
going
after
that
truck.
-
How?
I'm
making
this
up
as
I
go.













Ew!






He's
there!


Idiot!
Idiot!




Everything
at
last
-
The
Ark?
Nothing
is
lacking,
Or
what
is
left
of
you.
-
You
trust
these
guys?
Mr.
Katanga.
Mr.
Katanga,
They
are
my
family.
I
will
hear
of
it
My
cabin
is
theirs.
Mr.
Jones...
I've
heard
a
lot
about
you,
sir.
Your
appearance
is
exactly

Good-bye.

SALLAH:
Look
after
each
other.
I
am
already
missing
you.
You're
my
good
friend.
Sallah.
That
is
for
Fayah...
that
is
for
your
children...
and
this
is
for
you.

Thank
you.

INDY:
Where
did
you
go?
I'm
cleaning
up.
Where'd
you
get
that?
From
him.
Who
him?
Katanga.
I
got
a
feeling
ever
to
travel
It's
lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.



What'd
you
say?

Wait...
I
don't
need
any
help.
You
know
you
do.
You're
not
the
man
It's
not
the
years,
honey,
You
are...
Please,
I
don't
need
a
nurse.
-
I
just
want
to
sleep.
Marion,
leave
me
alone.
-
What
is
this
here?
Yes,
it
hurts.
Ow!
Well,
goddamn
it,
Indy,
Here.
Here.
This
isn't
too
bad.

Here.

Jones...

Jones?
We
never
seem
to
get


What
is
it?
Engines
have
stopped.

What's
happening?
Holy
shit.

I
sent
my

for

in

hold.
Come
on,

MAN:
Where
is
Dr.
Jones?
MARION:
What's
the
big
idea?
Let
go!

Don't
you
touch
me.




What
about
Jones?
There's
no
trace
yet,
sir.
KATANGA:
Jones
is
dead.
I
killed
him.
He
was
of
no
use
to
us.
This
girl,
however,
has
certain
She'll
bring
a
very
good
price.
Mmm?
Herr
Colonel,
If
it's
your
goal,
but
leave
us
the
girl.
It
would
reduce
our
loss
Savage!
You
are
not
in
the
position
We
will
take
what
we
wish.
And
then
decide
whether
or
not
to
blow
your
ship
The
girl
goes
with
me.
She'll
be

I'm
sure

Fhrer
If
she
fails
to
please
me,
you
may
do
with
her
as
you
wish.
I
will
waste
Excuse
me.
I
can't
find
Mr.
Jones,
Captain.
I've
looked
everywhere.
He's
got
to
be
here
somewhere.
Look
again.
-
I
found
him.
There.












The
altar
has
been
with
your
radio
instructions,
Good.
Take
the
Ark
there
immediately.
Monsieur...
I
am
uncomfortable
of
this...
Jewish
ritual.
Are
you
sure
it's
necessary?
Let
me
ask
you
this:
Would
you
be
more
comfortable
for
your
Fhrer?
Finding
out,
only
then,
if
the
sacred
pieces
Knowing,
only
then,
whether
you
have
accomplished
and
obtained
the
one
true
Ark?
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
I'm
going
to
blow
up
the
Ark,
Your
persistence
You're
going
to
give
Dr.
Jones...
surely
you
don't
think
you
can
That
depends
on
how
reasonable
All
I
want
is
the
girl.
If
we
refuse?
Then
your
Fhrer
has
no
prize.
Okay,
stand
back.
All
of
you,
stand
back.
Stand
back.
Okay,
Jones.
You
win!
Blow
it
up.


Yes,
blow
it
up!
Blow
it
back
to
God.
All
your
life
has
been
spent
in
pursuit
Inside
the
Ark
are
treasures
You
want
to
see
it
open
Indiana...
we
are
simply
passing
This...
This
is
history.
Do
as
you
will.








Marion,
don't
look
at
it.
Shut
your
eyes,
Marion.
Don't
look
at
it,
Ah...

It's
beautiful!


Indy?
Don't
look,
Marion!
Keep
your
eyes
shut!





Marion.

You've
done

Oh,
the
money's
fine.
The
situation's
Well,
gentlemen,
Where
is
the
Ark?
I
thought
we'd
settled
that.
The
Ark
is
somewhere
very
safe.
From
whom?
The
Ark
is
a
source
and
it
has
to
be
researched.
And
it
will
be,
Dr.
Jones.
We
have
top
men
Who?
Top
men.
Hey,
what
happened?
You
don't
look
very
happy.
-
Fools.
Bureaucratic
fools.
They
don't
know
Well,
I
know
what
I've
got
here.
Come
on.
I'll
buy
you
a
drink.

You
know...
a
drink?
