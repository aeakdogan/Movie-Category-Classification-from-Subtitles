I
got
nothing,
sir.
Nothing
but
blue
pills.
Should
we
try
to
contact
them?
Won't
matter.
-
We
should
start
back.
I
was
afraid
you'd
say
that.
ROLAND:
Search
every
pipe,
every
hole,
Sweep
as
wide
as
possible,
-
Lines
are
crawling
with
calamari.
Thought
you
could
use
Thank
you.
Any
change?
No.
-
How
is
he?
At
least
until
he
wakes
up.
-
What
do
you
mean?
He'd
better
have
some
good
answers.
You
see
these
cuts?
-
Why?
But
like
I
said,
MORPHEUS:
Roland,
I'd
like
to
run
-
For
what?
How
could
he
be
in
the
Matrix,
sir?
Please,
for
me.
This
is
what
keeps
bothering
me.
What?
MAGGIE:
His
neural
patterns
don't
read
The
strange
thing
is,
-
Where?
The
big
bupkes.
Nada.
COLT:
Sir,
I
got
the
projections.
Based
on
point
of
entry
and
past
speed,
Jesus
H.
Christ.
All
right,
let's
move
with
a
purpose.
Mauser,
I
want
forward
and
aft
guns
Make
sure
we're
running
-
Yes,
sir.
-
Hey!
You
got
a
call.
Operator.
It's
Seraph.
I
bring
word
from
the
Oracle.
Good
morning.
-
Who
are
you?
My
papa
says
you're
not
supposed
Are
you
lost,
Neo?
-
Where
am
I?
-
This
isn't
the
Matrix?
That's
where
we're
going,
-
Why
not?
-
Who
won't?
But
my
papa
says
we
have
to
do
...or
else
he
will
leave
us
here
Morpheus,
Trinity,
One
thing
I've
learned
in
all
my
years...
...is
that
nothing
ever
works
out
-
Who
are
you?
I
wish
there
was
an
easy
way
to
get
I'm
sorry
this
had
to
happen.
I'm
sorry
I
couldn't
be
sitting
here
...but
it
wasn't
meant
to
be.
I
made
a
choice,
and
that
choice
What
choice?
To
help
you,
to
guide
Neo.
Now,
since
the
real
test
for
any
choice
is
...knowing
full
well
...I
guess
I
feel
pretty
good
...because
here
I
am,
at
it
again.
-
Do
you
know
what
happened
to
Neo?
He
is
trapped
in
a
place
between
The
link
is
controlled
by
a
program
He
uses
it
to
smuggle
programs
If
he
finds
out
where
Neo
is
...then
I'm
afraid
our
choices
-
Why?
The
Merovingian.
He
has
placed
a
bounty
on
your
lives.
Seraph
knows
how
to
find
the
Trainman.
For
years
he
has
protected
me.
I
hope
he
can
do
the
same
for
you.
Please,
follow
me.
Oracle...
I
know,
Morpheus.
I
can
see
you're
filled
with
doubt,
After
everything
that
has
happened,
I
don't.
I
expect
just
what
I've
always
expected:
For
you
to
make
up
your
own
All
I
can
do
is
tell
you
that
your
friend
He
needs
all
our
help.
-
Are
you
from
the
Matrix?
No.
-
I
mean,
I
was.
-
I
had
to.
Sati!
Come
here,
darling.
Yes,
Papa.
I
am
sorry.
She
is
still
very
curious.
-
I
know
you.
I
am
Rama-Kandra.
This
is
my
wife,
We
are
most
honored
to
meet
you.
-
You
are
programs.
I
am
the
power-plant
systems
manager
My
wife
is
an
interactive
software
What
are
you
doing
here?
Kamala!
Goodness,
I
apologize.
It's
okay.
I
don't
have
an
answer.
-
I
don't
even
know
where
"here"
is.
It
is
between
your
world
and
our
world.
-
Who's
the
Trainman?
Why
did
I
know
The
Frenchman
does
not
forget,
-
You
know
him?
I
know
if
you
want
to
take
something
...that
does
not
belong
there,
Is
that
what
you're
doing
here?
-
Rama,
please.
He
may
never
see
another
face
I'm
sorry.
-
You
don't
have
to
answer
that
question.
The
answer
is
simple.
I
love
my
daughter
very
much.
I
find
her
to
be
the
most
beautiful
thing
But
where
we
are
from,
Every
program
that
is
created
If
it
does
not,
it
is
deleted.
I
went
to
the
Frenchman
-
You
do
not
understand.
Heard
a
program
speak
of
love.
-
It
is
a
human
emotion.
What
matters
is
the
connection
I
see
that
you
are
in
love.
Can
you
tell
me
what
you
would
give
Anything.
Then
perhaps
the
reason
you
are
here...
...is
not
so
different
That's
him.
-
Get
away!
Get
away
from
me!
-
Get
the
hell
away
from
me!
I
can't
help
you!

Oh,
no!
Damn
it!
-
When
is
the
train
due?
It's
not
like
the
Trainman
to
be
late.
You
think
it
has
something
I
cannot
say.
Who
knows
such
things?
-
You
know
the
Oracle?
I
consulted
with
her
She
promised
she'd
look
after
Sati
Goodbye?
-
You're
not
staying
with
her?
Our
arrangement
with
the
Frenchman
-
My
wife
and
I
must
return
to
our
world.
-
That
is
our
karma.
Karma
is
a
word,
like
love.
A
way
of
saying:
"What
I
am
here
to
do."
I
do
not
resent
my
karma.
Grateful
for
my
wonderful
wife,
They
are
gifts,
and
so
I
do
-
Papa,
the
train!

NEO:
All
right.
Hurry
it
up,
I'm
late!
Who
are
you?
-
He
is
a
friend.
I
know
you.
-
So
that's
what
they
wanted.
-
I'll
pay
you
whatever
you
want.
One
way
or
another,
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
You'll
stay
right
here
until
If
I
know
him...
...you're
gonna
be
here
-
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you.
I
built
this
place.
Down
here,
I
make
the
rules.
Down
here,
I'm
God.
Get
on
the
train
We
should
return
to
the
Oracle.
No.
We
know
what
has
to
be
done.
Shit.
You
gotta
be
kidding.
Holy
shit,
it's
wingless.
I
get
it.
You
must
be
ready
to
die.
I
need
to
speak
with
him.
Only
way
you're
getting
through
So
be
it.
There
are
no
weapons
allowed
At
the
bottom
of
this
elevator,
...and
if
we
are
lucky,
And
if
we're
unlucky?
There
will
be
many
men.
Can
I
take
your...?
Oh,
my
God.

What
in
the
hell?

I
don't
believe
this.
Hey!
Hey!

The
prodigal
child
returns.

Are
you
here
for
the
bounty,
Seraph?

Tell
me,
how
many
bullets
I
don't
know,
but
I
don't
think
-
We
only
want
to
talk.
I'm
sure
you
do.
You
have
fought
I'll
tell
you
what
I
will
do.
Put
down
the
guns,
and
I
will
promise
-
All
three
of
us?
Of
course.


Who
could
have
guessed
we'd
see
each
The
Fates
are
too
kind,
eh?
And
since
you,
my
little
Judas,
...I
can
only
surmise
the
fortuneteller
Disappointing,
but
not
unexpected.
I
do
hope,
however,
she
has
the
good
...and
to
remember
that
there
is
And
if
you
take
something
from
me,
You
know
why
we
are
here?
Come
now,
what
kind
of
question
It
is
my
business
to
know.
Some
might
think
this
is
a
strange
I
am
curious,
though,
-
Do
you
know?
No?
I
did
not
think
so.
But
it
is
always
best
to
ask,
huh?
We
want
to
make
a
deal.
Always
straight
to
business,
Okay.
I
have
something
you
want.
To
make
a
deal...
...you
must
have
something
And
it
so
happens
Something
I
have
wanted
It
is
said
they
cannot
be
taken...
...they
can
only
be
given.
What?
The
eyes
of
the
Oracle.

I
told
you
before,
there
is
no
escaping
It
is
that
nature
Where
some
see
coincidence,
Where
others
see
chance...
...I
see
cost.
Bring
me
the
eyes
of
the
Oracle...
...and
I
will
give
you
back
your
savior.
It
seems
a
perfectly
fair
Yes?
No?
I
don't
have
time
for
this
shit.
You
wanna
make
a
deal?
You
give
me
Neo,
or
we
all
die,
Interesting
deal.
You
are
really
ready
to
die
-
Believe
it.
If
she
has
to,
She's
in
love.
It
is
remarkable
how
similar
the
pattern
Time's
up.
What's
it
gonna
be,
Merv?
Okay.
You
got
yourself
in
here...
...you
can
get
yourself
out.

Are
you
ready
for
us?
Almost,
sir.
They
got
-
But
you
found
Neo?
No,
sir.
We
were
reading
something,
I
can't
leave
yet.
I
have
to
see
her.
Now?
It's
my
last
chance.
ORACLE:
-
You've
got
to
use
your
hands.
Cookies
need
love
like
everything
does.
Neo!
I
was
hoping
to
have
these
done
Sati,
honey,
I
think
it's
time
Take
the
bowl
to
Seraph
Okay.
-
I'm
glad
you
got
out.
ORACLE:
-
A
part
of
you.
Some
bits
you
lose,
I
don't
yet
recognize
my
face
...but
I
still
love
candy.
No,
thank
you.
Remember
what
you
were
like
Jittery
as
a
June
bug.
You
sure
did
surprise
me,
Neo,
You
gave
me
a
few
surprises
too.
I
hope
I
helped.
NEO:
You
helped
me
to
get
here,
Where
is
this
going?
-
Where
does
it
end?
-
You
don't
know
or
you
won't
tell
me?
...no
one
can
see
beyond
a
choice
they
-
What
choice?
I
have
mine
to
make,
Does
that
include
what
things
Of
course
not.
Then
why
didn't
you
tell
me
About
Zion
and
the
ones
before
me?
-
Because
it
wasn't
time
for
you
to
know.
You
know
who.
I
did.
Then
I
think
it's
time
for
me
to
know
So
do
I.
Tell
me
how
I
separated
my
mind
Tell
me
how
I
stopped
four
sentinels
Tell
me
just
what
the
hell
The
power
of
the
One
It
reaches
from
here
all
the
way
back
-
Where?
That's
what
you
felt
when
you
touched
You
should
be
dead,
but
apparently
The
Architect
told
me
that
...Zion
would
be
destroyed
tonight.
Please.
You
and
I
may
not
be
able
...but
that
man
can't
see
-
Why
not?
To
him,
they
are
variables
One
at
a
time,
each
variable
That's
his
purpose.
What's
your
purpose?
To
unbalance
it.
Why?
What
do
you
want?
I
want
the
same
thing
you
want,
Neo.
And
I'm
willing
to
go
The
end
of
the
war.
Is
it
going
to
end?
One
way
or
another.
Can
Zion
be
saved?
I'm
sorry,
I
don't
have
the
answer
If
there
is
an
answer,
there's
only
-
Where?
And
if
you
can't
find
the
answer...
...then
I'm
afraid
there
may
be
What
does
that
mean?
Everything
that
has
a
beginning...
...has
an
end.
I
see
the
end
coming.
I
see
the
darkness
spreading.
I
see
death.
And
you
are
all
that
stands
in
his
way.
Smith.
Very
soon,
he
is
going
to
have
the
power
But
I
believe
he
won't
stop
there.
He
won't
stop
until
What
is
he?
He
is
you.
Your
opposite,
your
negative.
The
result
of
the
equation
-
And
if
I
can't
stop
him?
...this
war
is
going
to
end.
Tonight,
the
future
of
both
worlds
...or
in
his.
How
are
you
feeling?
I
need
time.
-
That
figures.
-
What's
up,
Maggie?
Good.
Maybe
he's
got
some
answers.
ORACLE:
I
love
that
smell.
I
sure
am
going
to
miss
it.
-
Oracle.
I
know.
Sati,
honey.
Take
a
few
cookies
and
go
with
Seraph.
Can
I
come
back?
-
I
would
like
that
too.
I
hope
so,
hon,
I
hope
so.
I'm
scared,
Seraph.
Come.

He's
following
us.
Well,
well,
it's
been
a
long
time.
I
remember
chasing
you
I
have
beaten
you
before.
Yes,
true,
but
as
you
can
see,
And
you
must
be
the
last
exile.
-
The
Oracle
told
me
about
you.
What
did
she
say
about
me?
That
you
were
a
bad
man.
Oh,
I'm
not
so
bad,
The
great
and
powerful
Oracle,
I
suppose
you've
been
The
all-knowing
Oracle
How
can
she
be?
She
knows
everything.
But
if
that's
true,
then
why
is
she
here
Why
wouldn't
she
leave?
Maybe
you
knew
I
would
do
that,
If
you
did,
that
means
you
baked
those
...deliberately,
purposefully...
...which
means
that
you're
sitting
there
What
did
you
do
with
Sati?
"Cookies
need
love
You
are
a
bastard.
You
would
know,
Mom.
Do
what
you're
here
to
do.
Yes,
ma'am.


I
really
wish
I
could
help,
but
I
just...
What
about
the
cuts
on
your
arms?
Yeah,
definitely.
You're
right
about
that,
sir.
They
look
like
they
But
why
would
I
do
something
Unless,
of
course,
I
wasn't
myself.
But
if
I'm
not
me,
then
who
am
I?
-
Has
this
man
been
tested
for
VDTs?
But
he
is
showing
a
lot
Some
cross-synaptic
firing,
...with
fresh
fibrotic
scarring
I
want
the
truth.
I
don't
care
Sir,
we
found
her.
-
The
Logos?
About
time
we
had

Are
the
thermals
picking
up
No,
sir.
Nothing
yet.

What
about
the
ship?
-
Drop
down
and
keep
a
man
in
the
turret.
Get
a
full
diagnostic
on
that
ship
Careful,
sir.
The
squids
are
sneaky
bastards.

What
was
that?
NIOBE:
You
can
put
that
shit
away,
-
Niobe.
-
Are
you
all
right?
We
didn't
know
what
happened
after...
-
I'm
sorry.
I'm
happy
to
see
you
too.
-
Did
you
get
Neo
out?
-
How
did
you
know
about
that?
-
You
saw
her?
-
What
did
she
tell
you?
Exactly
what
I
needed
to
hear.

Every

None,

Uplinks

uh...
Something's
wrong
No,
there's
not.
You're

What's
going
on
in
there?
ROLAND:
The
way
I
see
it,
if
we
drop
down
...intersect
153,
we
might
surprise
them.
We'll
go
first,
hammer
as
deep
Hopefully
we
can
punch
a
hole
It
ain't
pretty,
but
the
way
I
see
it,
No,
it's
not.
There's
another
way.
A
support
line.
It
drops
down
right
here,
If
we're
lucky,
we
may
be
able
to
That's
a
mechanical
line.
-
No
one
can
pilot
mechanical.
-
Bullshit.
-
That
was
a
long
time
ago,
Niobe.
So
what?
You'll
be
the
only
one
that
can.
Hi.
I
know
time
is
always
against
us.
-
But
I
wanted
to
be
sure.
-
I
know
what
I
have
to
do.
There's
no
easy
way
to
say
this,
-
I
have
to
take
one
of
the
ships.
To
go
where?
To
the
machine
city.

I
know
it's
difficult
to
understand.
No,
it's
not.
You're
out
I
still
have
to
go.
In
100
years,
no
ship
has
been
-
You'll
never
make
it.
-
Is
this
what
the
Oracle
has
told
you?
This
is
asinine.
If
you
want
...but
do
it
without
-
You
have
to
believe
me.
I
have
to
go.
I
am
the
captain
of
this
ship.
And
this
ship
will
go
to
hell
-
He
can
take
mine.
Don't
try
to
tell
me
...with
my
ship
-
But
for
chrissake,
Niobe...
If
we
leave
inside
the
hour,
That's
as
good
a
plan
as
any.
It's
a
waste.
A
goddamn
waste.
Two
ships,
two
directions.
Sounds
like
providence,
-
You've
never
believed
in
the
One.
Then
why
are
you
doing
this?
I
believe
in
him.
Thank
you.
-
What's
that
for?
To
make
it
easier
for
you
to
remember.
What
if
I
don't
want
to
remember?
Why
would
you
want
that?
What
if
I
blew
that
EMP?
What
if
I
did
destroy
those
ships...
...and
I
am
responsible
If
I
did
that...
...it
wouldn't
be
very
safe

Of
course,
it
might
not
be
I'm
ready.
NEO:
...there's
something
I
have
to
say.
Something
you
need
to
understand.
I
know
I'm
supposed
to
go.
But
beyond
that...
...I
don't
know.
I...
I
know.
You
don't
think
I
knew
it
the
moment
you
said
you
had
Just
like
you
knew
the
moment
...that
I
was
coming
with
you.
I'm
scared,
Trin.
So
am
I.
It
took
me
10
minutes
But
I'll
tell
you
something.
Six
hours
ago,
I
told
the
Merovingian...
...I
was
ready
to
give
anything
Do
you
know
what's
changed
No.
Nothing.
ROLAND:
Finished
loading
ammunition?
Let's
move
it.
We
are
out
of
time.
You're
not
leaving
them
anything?
He
said
he
didn't
need
it.
I
ain't
saying
goodbye.
Thank
you.
I
can
only
hope
you
know
Me
too.
It
was
an
honor,
sir.
No,
the
honor
is
still
mine.
MAUSER:
We're
ready,
sir.
We're
already
late,
captain,
Bye,
baby.
Take
good
care
of
them.
Ready?
Engine's
still
firing.
Must
be
a

I'll
check
it
out.
I
should've
known
he'd
Bane.
No
one
ever
got
away
from
me
Every
time,
I
thought
it
was
the
last.
Every
time,
I
was
sure
we
had
you,
I
really
can't
express
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
think
I
might
enjoy
killing
you
Neo,
it's
Bane.
He's
psychotic!
You're
gonna
pay
for
that.
GHOST:
Twenty-seven
kilometers
to
go.
ROLAND:
What
is
it,
AK?
She's
dead,
murdered.
Goddamn
it.
I
knew
it.
I
knew
he
was
He
fired

Goddamn
it,

should
have
We
searched
the
whole

I
know
where
he
is.
-
We
gotta
go
back.

What
if
they
need
our
help?
-
Why?
...he'll
control
another
EMP.
At
this
point,
they're
on
their
own.
Mr.
Anderson.
I
see
you
are
as
predictable
in
this
world
-
What?
It
might
appear
that
way.
...that
appearances
can
be
deceiving.
Confused,
Mr.
Anderson?
Thank
you
for
bringing
me
the
gun.
Don't
do
it.
-
Shoot.
Shoot
now.
Do
it.
If
you
don't,
he'll
kill
us
both.
BANE:
Look
at
him.
He
knows
-
He
can't.
Back
away
from
the
gun
Let
her
go.

Somehow
familiar,
isn't
it?
We've
been
here
before,
I
do.
I
think
of
nothing
else.

Who
are
you?
I
admit,
it
is
difficult
to
even
think
The
stink
of
it
filling
every
breath,
Disgusting.
Look
at
how
pathetically
fragile
it
is.

What
do
you
want?
Yes.
That's
it,
Mr.
Anderson.
Look
past
the
flesh.
Look
through
the
soft
gelatin
of
these

No.
-
It
can't
be.
There
is
nowhere
I
won't
find
you.

It's
impossible.
Inevitable.
Goodbye,
Mr.
Anderson.
This
is
it.
It's
gotta
be.

Oh,
no.
I
wish
you
could
see
yourself,
Blind
messiah.
You're
a
symbol
for
all
of
your
kind,
Helpless.
Pathetic.
Just
waiting
to

It's
not

Mr.
Anderson.
It's
not

NEO:

Neo.
Oh,
no.
Your

I'll

okay.
It's

right,

you're
gonna

It
doesn't
make
sense.
He
did
it.
He
saved
us.
He
saved
us.
It's
over!
He
did
it!
He
did
it!
He
did
it!
It's
over!
It's
over!
He
did
it!
He
did
it!
-
What
is
it?
What
happened?
-
Did
what?
The
machines,
they're
gone.
The
war
is
over,
sir.
The
war
is
over.
Zion!
Zion!
Zion,
it's
over!
It's
over!
The
war
is
over!
The
war
is
over!
Whoo!
I
have
imagined
this
moment...
...for
so
long.
Is
this
real?
Neo,
wherever
you
are...
...thank
you.

Good
morning.
Well,
now.
Ain't
this
a
surprise.
You
played
a
very
dangerous
game.
Change
always
is.
Just
how
long
do
you
think
As
long
as
it
can.
What
about
the
others?
What
others?
The
ones
that
want
out.
Obviously,
they
will
be
freed.
I
have
your
word?
What
do
you
think
I
am?
Human?
Oracle!
We
were
afraid
we
might
not
find
you.
Everything's
okay
now.
Look,
look.
ORACLE:
Beautiful.
Did
you
do
that?
For
Neo.
That's
nice.
I
know
he'd
love
it.
Will
we
ever
see
him
again?
I
suspect
so.
Someday.
Did
you
always
know?
Oh,
no.
No,
I
didn't.
But
I
believed.
I
believed.
