It's
a
possible
gamma
sickness.
Milwaukee.
A

guarana
sodas.
Guess
it
had
a
little
more
kick
Wow.

We

Iocal

Is
he
a
fighter?
Your
target
is
a
fugitive
who
stole
military
secrets.
He
is
also
implicated
a
military
officer,
an
Idaho
state
trooper
So
don't
wait
to
see
if
he's
a
fighter!
Tranq

back.

Oh,

We've

a
bogey
That
is
the

Do

Get

Shoot!

HULK:
Leave
me
alone.


No!
No!


I
knew
something
was
different
He
had
it
on
him
when
he
bolted.
Is
that
a
girlfriend?
She
helps
him,
maybe?
She
is
no
Ionger
a
factor.
We
closed
that
door
to
him
a
Iong
time
ago.
He
wants
to
be
alone.
Forgive
me,
sir?
Doesn't
anybody
want
to
talk
He
didn't
Iose
us.
And
he
was
not
alone,
sir.
We
had
him.
And
then
something
hit
us,
something...
Something
big
hit
us!
It
threw
a
forklift
truck
Iike
it
was
a
softbalI!
It
was
the
most
powerful
thing
Well,
it's
gone.
Well,
if
Banner
knows
what
it
is,
I'm
gonna
track
him
down,
-and
I'm
gonna...
It
was
Banner.
-You
have
to
explain
that
statement,
sir.
You've
done
a
good
job.
Pack
up
and
get
our
men
on
a
plane.
Wait.
Please.

Where
am
I?
BLONSKY:
I've
run
into
bad
situations
I've
seen
good
men
go
down
purely
because
someone
didn't
Iet
us
know
I've
moved
on
to
the
next
one,
I
mean,
that's
the
job.
But
this?
This
is
a
whole
new
Ievel
of
weird.
And
I
don't
feel
inclined
So
if
you're
taking
another
crack
at
him,
And,
with
respect,
you
should
be
Iooking
because
if
that
thing
shows
up
again,
you're
gonna
have
a
Iot
of
professional
Sir.





Tienes
mas
stretchy?
Yeah.
Perfecto.

Let
me
emphasise
is
tremendously
sensitive,
You're
aware
that
we've
got
an
Well,
in
WWll,
they
initiated
a
subprogram
for
Bio-Tech
Force
Enhancement.
Yeah,
Super
Soldier.
Yes.
An
oversimplification,
but
yes.
And
I
dusted
it
off,
got
'em
doing
Across
the
hall,
We
were
tryin'
to
make
you
better.
Banner's
work
was
very
early
phase.
He
thought
he
was
working
I
would
never
have
told
him
But
he
was
so
sure
of
what
he
was
onto,
And
something
went
very
wrong.
Or
it
went
very
right.
As
far
as
I'm
concerned,
that
man's
You
said
he
wasn't
working
-No.
You
were
trying
other
things.
One
serum
we
developed
was
very
promising.
-So
why
did
he
run?
He
is
not
one
of
us.
-Blonsky,
how
old
are
you?
45?
-lt
takes
a
toll,
doesn't
it?
So
get
out
of
the
trenches.
You
should
be
a
Colonel
by
now,
No,
I'm
a
fighter.
You
know,
if
I
could
take
what
I
know
now,
that
would
be
someone
I
could
probably
arrange
Take
care,
kids.
Stan,
I
give
you
my
word,
whatever
you've
heard
about
me,
Oh,
I
know
it.
I
always
knew
it.
I
mean,
you
know
how
I
felt
about
you
two.
-Have
you
talked
to
her?
She
doesn't
know
that
I'm
here.
-She's
with
somebody?
They
say
he's
one
of
the
best.
Good.
That's
good.
-Bruce,
what
can
I
do
to
help
you?
-You
can
have
the
spare
room
upstairs.
There
is
one
other
thing.
Excuse
me.
Pardon
me.
Coming
through.
Hey,
paI.
I
got
a
delivery
on
five.
I
don't
think
there's
anybody
up
there.
Oh,
man.
I'm
gonna
catch
hell
I'Il
tell
you
what.
I
got
an
extra
medium.
-You
are
the
man.
All
right.

Okay.
We're
pretty
well
closed
here,
folks.
Oh,
come
on,
Stan.
It's
Friday
night.
Oh,
kids.
I
got
nothing
but
marinara
now.
Oh,
I
got
to
have
a
Mister
Pink,
please.
She
worked
through
dinner
again,
Stan?
And
he...
I
go,
"So,
yeah,
"l
can't...
I
don't
know
And
he
goes,
"Not
where
you
been
at."
I
thought,
"Oh,
my
God."
I
just
felt
so
awfuI.

Bruce?
Betty?
What's
going
on?
Betty...
Just
tell
me
if
I
saw
what
I
think
I

I
want
you

BETTY:
It's
our
data.
I
got
in
there
before
they
carted
it
all
away.
I
hoped
somewhere
that
it
might
tell
us
-Does
the
General
know
that
you
have
this?
I
haven't
spoken
to
him
in
a
couple
of
years.
You
have
to
be
sure.
Bruce,
I
don't
understand
why
we
can't
He
told
me
what
he
wanted
to
do.
He
wants
to
dissect
it
He
wants
to
make
it
a
weapon.
-Hi.
-l
thought
you
might
want
to...
Listen,

separate
infusions.
One
