they're
done,

don't
think
you're
cleared
for,
Yeah,
you're
right.
-It's
a
bitching
robot.
-Thank
you
so
much
for
this.
And...
I'm
smoking
over
here.

out
the

The
moon,
in
1972.
And
two
of
their
cosmonauts
And
I
just
found
them
alive.
You're
a
genius,
Brains.
That
was
smooth,
Bumblebee.
Missed
it
by
that
much.
Hi.
Would
somebody
care
to
tell
me
-Who
are
you?
Who
am
I?
Who
is
that?
Certainly.
No.
Dutch.
Don't
touch
me.
-I'm
not
gonna
touch
her.
Angel.
I
was
working.
I'm
sorry
about
this.
-Great.
We're
homeless.
You
had
your
chance
to
frisk
her.
-I
have
a
girlfriend.
India.
We're
supposed
to
be
I
do
remember,
They
need
me.
So,
what,
the
Autobots
and
the
military,
You
know
what
I
liked
It's
that
they
were
stories,
Look,
I
know
you're
thinking
And
you're
thinking
about
your
family.
-No?
Why
not?
Why
isn't
it,
Sam?
You
think
we'd
rather
have
his
medals,
I
hear
you.
I
get
it.
Just
stop
for
a
second.
You
think
I
could
sleep
last
night?
And
then
it
hit
me.
-He
doesn't
know
who
he
is
without
it.
You
matter
to
me.
I
know
you're
worried.
But
I
promise
you,
I
can
handle
this.
Can
you?
You
can
promise
it?
I
promise.
Sam,
I
don't
want
to
lose
you,
I'm
not
ready
for
this.
Are
you
coming
with
me?
I
can't.
Okay.
Hey.
Here's
your
foot.
The
warrior's
path
is
a
solitary
one.
How
the
hell
did
she
afford
that
car?
-Her
boss.
I
used
to
hate
them.
Now,
it's___
Going
to
a
gig
on
the
hunt
Nothing
like
driving
in
a
Maybach.
Germans
know
how
to
make
cars,
My
Dutchman,
tracked
them
down
here.
So,
these
cosmonauts
Bingo.
I
got
a
match.
You're
a
German
Shepherd,
Dutch.
The
thing
about
Russians
is,
It's
gonna
take
a
little
That
means
"good-bye."
Stay
loose.
Dutch,
give
me
something
tough.
Baryshnikov.
We
do
speak
English.
Dutch,
you
suck.
It's
a
Cyrillic
alphabet.
It's
like
all
the
buttons
I
don't
suck.
Agent
Seymour
Simmons,
We
know
who
you
are,
cosmonautchiks
So
what?
You
were
supposed
to
travel
then
it
all
got
shut
down.
The
question
is,
why?
"Can
my
child
smoke
in
here?"
Okay,
all
right.
Okay.
Go
ahead,
shoot
me.
I'm
willing
to
die
for
my
country.
Really?
You
are
beautiful.
Has
anyone
ever
She's
a
beautiful
woman.
Hey!
Dutch!
Back
in
the
cage.
Dutch!
Hold,
Dutch,
hold!
Control
your
boy,
please.
Dutch,
stop!
I'm
so
sorry.
That
is
the
old
me.
Okay,
let's
everybodyjust
calm
down!
Let's
lower
the
heat,
lower
the
guns.
You
are
about
to
see
America
first
to
send
man
to
the
moon.
But
USSR
first
to
send
camera.
In
1959,
our
Luna
3
take
picture
of
the
dark,
Sees
nothing.
But
in
1963,
Luna
4
sees...
-Strange
rocks.
Around
the
ship.
Hundreds
of
them.
Yeah,
show
picture.
With
some
drag
marks.
I've
seen
these.
Alien
pillars
for
a
space
bridge.
We
know
about
them
The
Decepticons
must
have
raided
took
the
pillars,
and
hid
them.
It
doesn't
make
sense.
The
Decepticons
have
the
ship.
Why
would
they
leave
Sentinel
when
he's
the
only
one
Unless...
He's
the
one
thing
they
still
need.
We've
got
to
meet
up
with
Sentinel,
Nlearing,
I
just
picked
up
Sentinel.
We're
coming
to
NEST
now.
Mr.
Witwicky,
that
I
did
not
want
you
Listen,
the
whole
thing
has
been
The
Decepticons
wanted
Optimus
because
only
Optimus
could
revive
him.
But
we
have
the
space
bridge.
Mearing,
you
have
five
pillars.
You're
doing
exactly
What
do
you
need
me
to
say
to
you?
The
Decepticons
are
coming
We're
going
to
NEST.
We
have
an
Energon
alert.

Ironhide!
Is
there
a
problem?
A
little
Mexican
standoff
we
got
here.
Weapons

And
we'll
let
you
escape
Drop
them.
That's
good.
Ironhiole,
watch
out!
Ironhide,

Behind
you!
Decepticon

Class

-Get
inside!
Let's
go!
-Lennox!
We
got
Decepticons
everywhere.
I've
got
my
whole
team
deployed
Protect
Sentinel!
Consider
it
done!
Hey,
you've
got
to
guard
him,
Indeed,
I
am.
What
you
must
realize,
is
we
were
never
going
to
win
the
war.
For
the
sake
of
our
planet's
survival,
with
Megatron_
-Get
back!
I
hereby
discharge
you
from
duty.
-Bee!
Rally
all
NEST
forces
back
to
the
base!
No...
Get
a
medic
down
here!
We
don't
have
enough
men!
Just
go
to
the
back
gate.
Take
cover!
Watch
left!
Watch
left!
Let's
go!
Follow
me!
-Director,
don't
go
there!
Hey,
Sentinel!
-Director!
What
do
you
think
you
are
doing?
I
am
a
Prime!
I
do
not
take
orders
from
you.
Director
Mearing,
come
on.
We
can't
fight
him.
Let's
go.
Now
return
what
belongs
to
me!
Oh,
my
God!
-You
guys
okay?
Everybody,
stay
calm.
Yeah,
take
a
look,
Optimus!
Sentinel
hit
the
vault!
Took
the
pillars.
Come
on,
let's
go.
We
need
to
hunt
this
thing
down!
Carly!
Hot
from
our
little
campfire.
S'mores.
Isn't
that
great?
We're
really
living
off
the
land.
Mom,
Dad,
have
you
guys
seen
Excuse
me.
Can
you
knock,
please?
Why
wouldn't
she
be
at
home?
We
had
a
fight
or
be
on
a
break.
I
don't
really
know.
-What?
No.
I
can't
go
into
details,
Mom.
Sit
down.
We're
having
You
may
not
know
this,
but
your
father
and
I
You
know,
there
was
a
time
when
I
thought
-Can
we
please
not?
You
break
up
with
No.
Stop.
Stop,
okay?
She
dumped
me,
I
moved
on
to
something
better.
The
second
beautiful
girl,
Why
don't
you
help
me?
-They
had
an
argument.
You're
not
gonna
get
a
third
one,
What
the...
Ma!
Maybe
you
just
don't
know
-I
don't
want
to
talk
about
this
anymore.
-Tell
him
about
the
book.
Okay.
You've
gotta
read
this.
-There's
some
killer
shit
in
here.
-That's
it,
I'm
going.
Sit
down,
sit
down!
Back
me
up!
-Happy
wife,
happy
life.
Unhappy
wife,
stone-cold
misery
-Stop.
All
I'm
saying
is,
do
you
love
this
girl?
-She's
the
one.
I
mean,
your
dad
and
I,
he
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
find
me.
Say
what
you
said.
Say
it.
"l
will
follow
you
to
the
end
of
time_"
Does
that
suck
or
what?
-it's
like
a
bad
sci-fi
film.
I
want
you
to
get
out
of
the
city.
You
get
You
understand?
I
love
you.
My
master!
Such
a
brilliant
scheme!
So
when
Sentinel
left
Cybertron,
He
was
meant
to
rendezvous
before
fate
waylaid
us
both.
The
only
way
to
revive
him,
we
needed
Prime
and
his
Matrix.
Excellent
strategy.
Mine,
mine!
So
he
is
now
your
partner,
master?
He
is
my
greatest
triumph.
So
impressive.
Commencing
transport.
Stop!
No!
No,
Sentinel!
Forgive
me.
Here
we
are.
Fight
us
now.
Contact!
Watch
out!
Move
it!
Move
it!
Autobots,
retreat!
Why,
Sentinel,
why?
For
Cybertron!
For
our
home!
What
war
destroyed,
we
can
rebuild!
No,
it's
not
the
only
way.
This
is
our
So
lost
you
are,
Optimus.
On
Cybertron,
we
were
gods.
And
here,
they
call
us
machines.
Let
the
humans
serve
us,
or
perish.
You're
lucky
I
didn't
kill
you.
It's
not
over.
Now,
if
I
were
him,
lwouldn't
let
you
It's
funny.
I
was
just
thinking
I
could
really
use
some
advice
-Can
I
speak
to
you,
Carly?
Have
a
drink.
You
know
what,
I
don't
need
a
drink.
I
just
need
to
speak
Is
that
okay
with
you,
Mr.
Inappropriate?
Excuse
me.
-What's
going
on?
I
really
think
I
can
help
you,
Sam.
I
remember
a
talk
I
had
Yeah,
now's
not
the
time.
Of
course,
it
was
way
back,
of
budget
review
You
see,
when
it's
not
your
war,
Move.
Too
direct?
Or
is
it
just
me?
Certainly
not
you,
sir.
You're
mine!
No!
-Get
help!
-Someone
get
help!
Good
night,
Mr.
Dylan.
Get
me
out
of
here!
Help!
Get
help!
-He's
young.
He
will
learn.
Good
night.
It
was
a
fun
night.
You
really
think
you're
the
first
man
ever
Who
are
you?
Do
you
know
why
we've
not
been
back
Because
these
two,
they
came
to
my
dad
and
they
told
him
Make
it
way
too
expensive
shut
down
the
American
And
they've
been
our
clients
ever
since.
-You
helped
them
kill
people?
Besides,
it's
not
I
am
a
liaison.
I
liaise.
It's
hostile
takeover
time,
Sam.
Sam!
-Sam!
Sam!
I've
had
my
eye
on
you
for
years,
Sam.
You're
the
one
spy
as
someone
close
to
the
Autobots.
Sam!
Don't
do
what
he
wants!
Yes,
he
will.
They
all
do.
They
will
slaughter
her,
In
the
time
it
takes
you
to
blink,
So
you
show
a
little
respect
when
someone
offers
you
a
job!
Wrist.
You
are
to
track
down
Optimus
Prime,
because
you're
the
one
human
and
you
will
ask
one
question.
How
does
he
intend
to
fight
back?
Has
a
nasty
little
bite,
doesn't
it?
It
lets
us
see
what
you
see,
and
it
taps
your
nervous
system.
So,
if
you
so
much
as
try
and
signal...
I
don't
know
what
to
tell
you,
Sam.
Relationships
have
consequences.
She
is
here
because
of
you.
Stop,
stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Soundwave,
would
you
please?
Sam,
do
your
job.
She'll
be
safe.
I
give
you
my
word.
I'll
kill

Optimus?
What
your
leaders
say
is
true.
I
told
them
whom
to
trust.
That
doesn't
make
it
your
fault.
Remember
this.
You
may
lose
your
faith
in
us,
but
never
in
yourselves.
I
need
to
know
I
know
this
is
strategy,
with

something.
You
can
tell
me.
There
is
no
plan.
If
we
just
do
what
they
want,
You
are
my
friend,

You
always
will
be.
But
your

have
spoken.
From
here,
the

will
be
your
own.
Make
it
short.

see,
they
can't
rebuild
How
many
rocks
up
there
in
What
are
you
talking
about?
They're
not
shipping
people.
Oh,
my
God.
What's
Sentinel
doing
here?
Watch.
They're

Your
Excellency.
He's
such
a
dick.
-You
want
this
to
happen?
You
think
I
asked
for
this?
Yeah,
and
when
Cybertron's
here
I
guess
they'll
still
need
a
human
leader.
Don'tjinx
me.
It
is
time
for
the
slaves
of
Earth
Seal
off
the
city.
Get
the
dogs
outta
here
now!
I
guess
they
didn't
tell
you
about
You
think
I'm
at
every
meeting?
Look,
I'm
safe.
They
said
I
was
safe.
Let's
roll!
We
had
a
signal
earlier.
It's
not
working.
This
is
a
national
emergency
broadcast.
Chicago
has
suffered
a
massive
attack.
Wrong
way!
Get
out
of
here!
Go
back!
There
is
a
ring
of
alien
ships
Our
high-range
bombers
They
can't
get
through
Our
satellites
have
been
jammed.
We
have
no
way
to
monitor
Our
old
NEST
teams
are
on
stand-down
We're
about
10
minutes
from
We
have
Special
Forces
and
infantry
is
staging
at
the
perimeter
Excuse
me,
excuse
me,
Can't
we
get
any
eyes
in
there
at
all?
They
Keep
shooting
clown
our
drones.
They
want
us
blind.
But
we
do
have
Well,
whoever's
manning
can
we
try
to
redirect
them
The
kid,
Witvvickety,
Said
some
point-man
human
op
is
there
Listen,
if
I
know
anything,
I
know
this,
that
kid
is
an
alien-bad-news
magnet.
My
God.
We
came
here
to
find
her
Are
we
really
going
out
there,
Epps?
I'm
not
going
in
there.
No
one's
going
in.
I
am.
With
or
without
you,
I'll
find
her.
You're
gonna
get
yourself
killed,
Sam.
Is
that
what
you
want?
You
came
all
the
way
out
here
Listen
to
what
I'm
saying.
She's
here
because
of
me.
Listen,
if
you
go
in
this
building,
there's
no
way
What
do
you
suggest
I
do?
It's
over.
I'm
sorry,
but
it's
over.
No.
Incoming!
We
will
kill
them
all.
Wreckers,
kill
him!
This
is
going
to
hurt!
A
lot!
Your
leaders
will
now
understand.
Decepticons
will
never
leave
And
we
needed
them
to
believe
For
today,
in
the
name
of
freedom,
we
take
the
battle
to
them!
-I
saw
your
ship
blow
up!
We
were
never
in
the
ship!
We
were
hidden
Splashed
down
back
in
the
Atlantic,
We
ain't
going
nowhere.
Yeah,
no
one's
exiling
us.
The
Autobots
are
staying
right
here.
They're
surrounding
the
city
so
that
no
one
can
see
Our
only
chance
I
think
I
know
where
to
look!
Mini-drone
is
on
approach
You're
telling
me
Poor
kid.
Probably
never
got
close.
So,
you
can
fly
this
thing,
right?
What
is
that...
What
is
that?
So
you
so-so
can
fly
this.
We're
right
behind
you.
All
right,
we're
going
in!
The
city
is
secure.
The
humans
cannot
stop
us.
As
the
afternoon
falls,
the
rest
of
the
pillars
This
is
the
victory
I
promised
you
where
we
rebuild
Cybertron
together!
I
have
deigned
to
work
with
you
that
our
planet
may
survive!
I
will
never
work
for
you!
You
would
be
wise
I'm
so
sick
of
this.
Where
is
she?
Where
is

You've
got
some
balls.
No,

happen
soon.
No

How
do
we
get
these
bridges
down?
Spread
out.
Check
in
there.
E
Epps,
I've
been
looking
for
your
ass.
Retirement
is
wack.
Even
worse,
we
can't
get
across
the
river
and
the
Autobots
Just
pan
the
camera
around,

right?
All
right.
Pan...

Good

Dutch.
Get

Hurry!
They're
triggering
the
pillars!
Prisoners?
You're
keeping
prisoners?
Yes.
You
need
to
teach
them
about
respect.
This
was
all
business,
but
now
I
understand.
Bee,
I
think
they're
going
to
kill
us.
-You,
your
time
is

to
help
him.
Turn

We
gave

a
run.
We
did
it,
Brains!
We
did
it!
Rip
this

No!
Get

here,
Sentinel!
Optimus,
you
forget
your
place!
I
bring
you
Cybertron,
your
home,
and
still
you
choose
humanity.
You
were
the
one
who
taught
me
I
will
retrigger
that
pillar!
Then
you'll
have
to
go
through
me!
Okay,
I've
got
to
try
and
help.
-I
have
to.
You
stay
here.
You'll
be

okay?
I

You

okay?
There's
only
one
future
for
me.
Cybertron,
you
are
saved,
at
last.
Have
you
come
to
surrender?
-Was
it
all
worth
it?
All
your
work
to
bring
Sentinel
back
It's
actually
almost
tragic.
You
dare
lecture
me,
slave?
Your
Decepticons
and
yet,
their
leader
won't
be
you!
It
will
be
me!
It
will
always
be
me.
In
any
minute
now,
you'll
be
nothing
but
Sentinel's
bitch.
Rocket!
Die!
You
chose
sides?
You
chose
wrong.
Always
the
bravest
of
us!
But
you
could
never
make
Our
planet
will
survive!
No!
We
were
gods
once.
All
of
us.
-But
here...
...there
will
only
be
one!
This
is
my
planet!
I
just
saved
a
whole
other
world.
You
think
you're
a
hero,
huh?
No.
I'm
just
a
messenger.
The
pillar's
still
connected!
Bring
it
up!
-Bee!
Let's
do
this!
Pillar's
still
connected!
Rip
that
pillar
down!
Now,
we
need
a
truce.
All
I
want
is
to
be
back
in
charge.
Besides,
who
would
you
be
without
me,
Prime?
Time
to
find
out.
Optimus,
all
I
ever
wanted
was
the
survival
of
our
race.
You
must
see
why
I
had
to
betray
you.
You
didn't
betray
me.
You
betrayed
yourself.
No,
Optimus!
Sam.
I
love
you.
You're
the
only
thing
and
I'll
do
anything
to
make
it
up
to
you,
I'm
going
to
hold
you
to
that.
Just
never
let
me
go.
I
promise.
Rings.
I
love
this
car.
Bee,
you've
got
to
slow
it
clown.
I'm
just
trying
to
help
out.
In
any
war
there
are
calms
between
storms.
You
fought
bravely.
There
will
be
days
when
we
lose
faith.
Days
when
our
allies
turn
against
us.
But
the
day
will
never
come
and
its
people.
That's
what
I
call
Arrest
him.
It
was
worth
it!
-Get
him
out
of
here!
Go
ahead,
take
me
in!
I
want
to
go
in!
Come
on,
Charlotte,
