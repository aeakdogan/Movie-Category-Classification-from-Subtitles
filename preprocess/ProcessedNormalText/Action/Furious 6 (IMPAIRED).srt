SeГ±or
O'Conner,
seГ±or
O'Conner!

It's
okay,
you're
just
in
time.
You're
going
to
be
a
great
father,
Brian.
What
makes
you
so
sure?
Because
I'll
be
there
-
Get
in
there.
DOM:
Brian.
Remember,
the
second
everything
changes.
Our
old
life
is
done.
Let's
go
for
a
little
ride.
-
Special
Agent
Hobbs?
I
read
your
file.
Top
of
your
class
at
FLETC.
Cairo,
Tunis.
Youngest
RSO
ever
in
Afghanistan.
Hell,
if
you're
half
as
good
we're
going
to
get
along
just
fine.
A
Russian
military
caravan
attacked,
satellite
component
stolen.
Cars
just
came
out
of
nowhere.
Six
hospitalized,
a
dozen
vehicles
destroyed.
All
that
in
under
90
seconds,
in
and
out.
This
is
world-class.
Job
this
good,
who
could
get
this
done.
How
the
hell
did
that
get
up
there?

They
caught
one.
Where?
I
got
you
five
minutes
with
this
guy.
I
only
need
two.
I
want
your
boss.
Where's
Shaw?
I
ain't
telling
you
shit.
I
was
hoping
-

Is
that
legal?
No.
But
are
you
going
to
go
I've
got
rights,
Not
today.
OAKES:
No,
no!
-
Well,
is
he
talking?
That
room
is
So,
any
information
Great.
Now
they
can
take
the
morning
off.
Let's
go
pick
him
up.
Woman,

If
you
want
to

HOBBS:
This
is
what
It
wasn't
that
hard
I
wasn't
hiding.
How's
the
life
I
like
it
here.
Nice
weather,
and
no
extradition.
So
what
are
you
Last
Tuesday,
took
down
an
entire
I
don't
do
cold
weather.
I
know
it
wasn't
you.
But
you're
going
to
help
me
-

You
can't
touch
him,
Hobbs.
I'm
not
here
to
See,
he's
going
to
As
a
matter
of
fact,
he's
going
to
beg
me.
This
was
taken
a
week
ago.
I'll
see
you
out
front.
It's
Letty,
isn't
it?
It's
impossible.
If
that
was
my
husband,
I
would
go.
I'm
going
to
need
everything,
You'll
get
it
when
No
team.
This
is
going
to
It's
not
that
simple.
The
crew
we're
after,
they
hit
like
You
go
in
alone,
I've
been
chasing
this
guy
and
believe
me,
is
on
your
front
doorstep,
I
need
your
help,
Dom.
I
need
your
team.
ROME:
Okay,
ladies,
Listen,
Come
on.
Listen,
I
know
a
few
of
y'all
but
you
have
till
you've
seen
it
We
got
a
penthouse
suite
with
an
ocean
view
that's
150-foot
yacht
with
Mmm-hmm.
Safe
to
say,
No,
you
are.
-
Cheers.




Nice!

I'm
a
citizen
of
the
world.
Ever
thought
about
Starting
a
life
together?
Aren't
we
doing
that?
Are
we?








Hello?
Dom?
I'll
be
there.
Hey,
my
man,
All
right,
listen,
ladies.
Something
came
up.
You
know
that
casino
I
got
some
vouchers
to
the
buffet.
BRIAN:
What
do
you
-
He
likes
it.
Yes.
Or
this?
Yes.
That's
my
boy.
Are
you
watching?

BRIAN:
It's
Uncle
Dom.
Are
you
waving?
Hey,
Jack.
What's
up,
Uncle
Dom?
You
excited
to
see
him?
Are
you
already
You
say,
"Dad's
not
He
chose
that
car.
We
know
I
brought
you
-
Yeah!
He's
also
a
Toretto.
Luckily,
he
has
I
think
he
decided,
Mia.

I
think
it's
time
Come
on,
baby.
Okay.
Say
bye.
BRIAN:
It's
weird,
huh?
What's
weird?
We
got
everything.
You
know,
down
to
the
beer
But
it
just...
I
don't
know,
Maybe
it's
because,
uh,
you
don't
realize
how
much
until
somebody
takes
it
away.
I
don't
know.
The
place
has
probably
you
wouldn't
even
recognize
it
anymore.
Yeah.
Everything's
changed.
So
what's
up
with
you?
Taken
a
week
ago.
BRIAN:
Diplomatic
Security
Service.
Hobbs.
You
know,
This
is
exactly
what
cops
do.

Letty's
dead,
Dom.
I
need
to
know
for
sure.
Then
I'm
going
with
you.
You
said
you
were
going
to
We
both
said
that
we
were
MIA:
He's
right.
We're
family.
If
we
got
a
problem,
And
I'll
feel
safer
watching
each
other's
backs.
You're
stronger
together.
Now
go
get
Letty.
Bring
her
home.

Thank
God!
Finally,
some
equipment
ROME:
What
up,
boy?
TEJ:
This
is
way
better
Way
better.
You
sure
about
these
guys?
Nope.
Has
anybody
heard
Last
time
anyone
saw
them,
they
were
hitting
I
thought
that
was
And
who's
paying
for
all
this
equipment?
So
now
we
work
for
The
Hulk?
Why
do
I
smell
baby
oil?
If
you
keep
you're
going
to
DOM:
All
right,
Hobbs,
you
got
the
best
standing
right
Give
them
a
reason
to
stay.
Our
target
is
Owen
Shaw.
Former
major
in
the
S.A.S.,
He
ran
the
UK's
Mobility
Division
Ah,
damn.
We're
talking
vehicular
warfare.
-
You
got
some
chips?
For
years,
they've
been
but
it's
their
that
graduated
them
Three
targets,
The
program
terminal
Got
a
little
change?
TEJ:
Seriously?
and
you're
still
That's
how
you
So
what
does
Well,
our
best
guess
is
is
building
-
Which
is?
Designed
to
block
for
24
hours.
If
you
blind
a
soldier
in
the
middle
of
a
fight,
If
you
blind
the
loss
of
life
This
could
be
worth
billions
TEJ:
Billions?
Why
don't
we
just
Hey,
man.
Which
one
of
these
It
says
something
about...

It's
on
the
house.
I
want
you
to
He's
only
got

I
intend
to
stop
him
Now,
I
know
So
I'm
offering
you
to
make
that
You
want
to
make
Get
us
to
Letty,
full
pardons
I
can't
promise
you
that.
Yes,
you
can.
That's
the
deal.
Take
it
or
leave
it.
You
get
me
Shaw,
and
I'll
get
your
pardons.
You
heard
him.
But
this
is
different.
We're
not
we're
not
dealing
This
is
a
whole
We're
getting
paid,

HOBBS:
Interpol
picked
up
I
went
in,
had
a
little
He
gave
up
Shaw's
hideout.
Then
why
aren't
we
Well,
we
weren't
invited.
(MALE
DISPATCHER
Hobbs,
they're
sending
in
He's
wired.
He's
going
to
give
a
positive
ID
SHAW:
So,
the
cops
just
let
you
go,
huh?
Don't
worry,
Oh,
I'm
not
worried.
Okay,
turn
it
over
for
me.


God,
it's
amazing.
The
simplest
things
Good
news
is,
everything
runs
Look,
Shaw...
Wait,
Shaw!
Shaw!
Shaw!
I
just
got
confirmation
on
Shaw.
Wait,
wait,
hold
up...
Police
scanners
are
saying
BRIAN:
Shit.
He
brought
us
here
This
whole
thing's
a
set-up.
-
Brian,
take
the
team.
Hobbs
and
I
will
Shaw
leads
to
Letty.

Come
on,
you
son
of
a
bitch.
What's
this?
It's
your
share
SHAW:
You're
part
You
do
your
job,
There's
a
little
Consider
it
an
advance.
For
what?
The
next
job,
of
course.
Which
job?
The
one
we're
Han,
how
far
Twelve
blocks
away.
You
guys,
Shaw
must
have
pulled
All
right,
y'all,
It's
been
fun

Stop!
Drop
the
bag!
-
There
he
is.
Toretto,
it's
on
you.
Ain't
gonna
happen.



Sorry
about
that,
boys.
Interpol,
straight
ahead.

Let's
go,
guys.
Let's
go,
boys.
Get
in!
Let's
go!


Hey!
We
got
to
move.
Now!

-
Shaw,
we
have
three
cars
tailing
us.

Guys,
I
got
the
Rover.
Okay,
I
got...
Whatever
the
hell

What
is
that,
a
hockey
puck?



Oh,
shit!

Approaching
Dom!
Tej
and
Roman
are
out!
Where
you
at?
I'm
right
behind
you!


Stay
on
track.
Boys,
I
got
eyes
on
Shaw.
-
I
got
right.

VEGH:
No
problem.
Letty.
Take
the
wheel.

Letty.

ROME:
This
is
crazy.
We
are
not
in
Brazil.
So,
now
we
got
cars
On
some
007-type
shit?
Man,
you
really
got
Your
voice
just
"This
is
not
what
we..."

See,
man,
when
a
woman
that's
a
clear
sign
We
need
to
get
That
could
have
been
No.
That's
not
as
big
Mia...
Uh,
It's
definitely
Letty.
But
it's,
uh..
It's
complicated.
Letty's
alive.
That's
all
that
matters.
We
have
her
back,
Brian.
Well,
do
me
a
favor
-
Be
safe.
She
definitely
saw
She
looked
dead
at
me,
Brian.
Maybe
the
Letty
Even
though
she's
alive,
You
don't
turn
Even
when
they
do.
-
Ivory.
It's
going
to
No
problem,
treacle.
Are
you
good?
Yeah.
Okay,
listen
up.
That
was
a
very
from
Hobbs'
usual
We
need
to
learn
Vegh?
O'Conner,
Parker,
Pearce,
Toretto
and
the
rest
of
the
team.
These
guys
are
Tonight
these
from
taking
us
down.
Show
them
You
might
Ring
any
bells?
LETTY:
Yeah.
That's
the
guy
I
shot.
SHAW:
You
look
happy.
I
don't
remember
him.
KLAUS:
That's
bullshit.
We
got
a
problem,
guys.
We
got
a
picture
of
her
Klaus,
aren't
you
Don't
make
me
go
over
there
SHAW:
She
doesn't
Names
and
records
I
want
personal
information.
Find
their
weaknesses,
ROME:
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah,
right.
This
is
crazy,
man.
What
are
you
I'm
sitting
here
It's
like
we're
hunting
Look
at
this
Clearly,
that's
me.
We
got
a
white
Hobbs.
Tej,
it's
an
African
That's
like

And
Brian!
When
did
you
do
I'm
just
playing,
man.
You
know
you're
All
right,
lock
it
up.
First
off,
this
is
the
worst
damn
city
in
the
They
got
cameras
on
I
got
video
footage
Let's
track
that,
And
secondly,
on
what
Shaw's
crew
They
ripped
off
of
every
location
that
houses

So
where
are
they
at?
There
are
over
But
the
list
is
Which
means,
it's
going
to
happen
They
got
a
window,
-
We
gotta
move.
So
let's
break
this
down.
You
met
them.
We
know
they
You
heard
that
flip
car
Sequential
transmission.
That
didn't
sound
That
was
a
turbo
diesel.
It
sounded
like
something
TEJ:
Did
you
see
it
and
still
stay
flat
Yeah,
hydraulics.
Or
magnetic
suspension.
HAN:
Who
not
only
has
but
can
fabricate
Maybe
a
handful
Regular
tuner
shops
We're
going
to
have
to
Han,
Gisele,
Roman,
We
find
the
guy
we
find
Shaw.
-

-
I'll
help.
Tej,
we're
gonna
need
cars
without
computer
Make
sure
they're
fast.

I
got
this.
I'm
already
on
it,
Dom.
Hobbs...
I
said
I
got
this.
This
should
be
interesting.

TEJ:
Man,
you
really
You
can't
just
throw
a
bunch
of
factory-line
Hey.
That
car
is
a
hell
of
a
car.
You're
talking
about
twin-turbo
V8,
spitting
out
560
ponies,
son.
He
reads
the
brochure.
I'm
proud.
But
with
cars,
It's
all
between
you
It's
a
bond,
It
sounds
like
a
marriage.
Yeah,
but
with
cars,
they
don't
take

HOBBS:
Jesus.
With
price
tags
like
this,
You
ain't
thinking
about
Kitchen
help
entrance
Come
again?
I
don't
mean
any
offense,
but
you
couldn't
Substantial
lack
Clearly
you're
And
you.
Hmm.
Shoes,
shirt,
trousers.
Functional.
And
your
posture,
My
guess
is
military.
That's
U.S.
Which
is
not
enough
So,
if
you're
not
then
you
must
be
But
please,

Oh,
he
needs
to
be
Like
I
said,
I
got
this.
All
right,
this
is
ROME:
Holy
shit.
What's
the
dude
plan
on
hunting?
Moby
Dick?
HAN:
That
must
be
our
guy.
So,
how
do
you
all
Han
and
I
got
this.
We
go
in
tight,
and
you
all
There's
one
thing
He's
a
man.
Let's
go.
"He's
a
man"?
You
know,

What
you're
looking
at
It's
specific
to
one
handgun,
the
PSM.
Given
that
handguns
are
there's
very
few
people
So
if
somebody
wanted
to,
say,
track
down
where
it
came
from,
it
wouldn't
be
too
hard.
I
was
a
cop
for
a
lot
of
years.
A
pawn
shop.

I
don't
know,
man.
And
I
don't
like


"He's
a
man"?
Come
on,
ROME:
"Doing
her
job."
I
see
what's
going
on.
See
what?
You
got
the
little
Little
birds
floating


Uh,
you
don't
want
to
lease
this
model.
Can
you
please
stop
talking?
No,
no,
you're
in
love!
Look
at
you!

Just
stop.
You
got
special
plans?
You're
going
to
Better
make
sure
you
'cause
she
doesn't
And
if
it's
not
you
better
be
big
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about.

That's
why
all
your
girlfriends
wear
We're
looking
for
information.
You're
looking
for
information?
About
what?
Information
about
cars.
In
particular,
Ramp
cars.
We'd
be
very
interested
Why
should
I
help
you?
Because
we're
Because
you're
What
can
you
offer
Hmm?


Stop!
Stop!
You
look
like
a
man
My
friend
here
can
you've
never
Do
we
have
a
deal?
Deal!
Deal!
Deal!
ROME:
I
take
it
back.
Me
likey.


Stop,
stop,
stop.
So
this
is
how
you
"got
this"?
What
good
is
having
if
you
don't
spend
But
don't
worry
about
that.
Mr.
Parker,
again,
and
say
how
much
If
there's
ever
-
Anything?
Now
that
you
mention
it,
he
really
likes
Uh,
this
shirt?
That
shirt.
I'm
not
entirely
sure
that
this
shirt
It
will
fit.
He
needs
a
shirt
Functional.
That's
it,
functional.
Okay.
-
I'll
hold
that.
Come
on,
man,
Yes,
doing
my
best.
Damn,
you
need
Well,
if
that
will
be
all...
And
the
pants,
too.
Right.
TEJ:
While
you're
at
it,
I
like
that
watch.
This
is
for
you.
-
And
this
is
for
you.
Good
day,
gentlemen.

So
I,
um,
I
got
the
information
in
here.


May
I
ask
why
He
took
something
of
ours.
We'd
like
to
talk
FIRUZ:
Let's
see

All
right.
They
say
you're
the
man
to
see.
Oh,
they
do,
do
they?
What
do
you
want,
mate?

That
might
be
a
bad
idea.
-

-
I'm
looking
for
the
owner
of
this.

Take
a
closer
look.
About
a
week
ago,
bought
guns,
ammo,
A
girl?
What
did
she
look
like?
Tough
chick,
dark
hair.
Mean
streak.
Word
is
Where
can
we
find
her?
How
do
I
know?

No.
You
don't.
Take
care,
guys.

Oh,
shit.

Sorry,
girls.

Let's
go!



Hold
on.
Stay
with
me.
Stay
with
me.
Tell
me
where
and
I'll
make
him

Braga...



-

POLICE
OFFICER:
Hey,
you!
Stop
right
there!


-
You
go!




No
one
needs
to
No
one.

We
lost
Ivory.
He's
gone.
Thanks.
That's
it?
If
Ivory's
dead,
If
you
make
a
mistake,

That's
a
great
eulogy,
Shaw.
Are
you
going
to
for
the
rest
of
us
You're
the
last
one
I
like
you,
Letty.
I
dare
say
I
even
When
I
found
you
and
you
couldn't
I
said
to
myself,
"This
girl
has
a
gift.
"She's
a
blank
page."
And
that
made
me
feel
If
something
happened
to
you,
for
instance,
I
think
I
might
find
that
What
I'm
saying
is,
I
would
hate
to
see
you
make
a
mistake.
I'm
going
to
get
some
air.
-


-
What
the
hell
happened?
She's
lovely.
-
Are
you
all
right?
Tej,
what
have
you
got?
Footage,
CCTV?
TEJ:
I
just
went
Believe
it
or
not,
everywhere
Shaw's
team
is,
That's
a
hell
All
right,
we're
going
to
pay
CCTV
a
little
visit.
What
is
that?
That
is
a
new
toy
for
you.
So,
what
happened?
Shaw's
goons
showed
up
But
we
got
something
big.
-
DOM:
What?
He's
working
with
Shaw.
What
are
you
talking
about?
HAN:
It's
true.
That
phone's
filled
that
lead
straight
Who
the
hell
is
Braga?
He
ran
one
of
the
biggest
cartels
in
Mexico.
And
my
old
boss.
We
used
codes
to
move
money
BRIAN:
It
all
makes
sense.
Braga
was
running
Letty,
It
would
explain
how
TEJ:
Okay,
so
you
all
know
about
him,
He's
sitting
in
a
prison
in
Los
Angeles.
How
do
you
know
that?

Brian
put
him
there.
BRIAN:
All
right,
If
the
two
of
them
were
working
together,
Braga
will
know
what
Shaw's
up
to.
I'm
going
to
pay
him
a
visit.
Are
you
serious
right
now?
Think
about
what
you're
saying.
You're
wanted,
Brian.
The
moment
you
step
You're
not
coming
back.
"Coming
back"?
Let
me
worry
about
that.

This
is
on
me.
I'm
the
one
that
served
her
up
to
Braga.
I'm
the
one
that
gets
to
make
it
right.
Let
me
make
it
right.
Be
careful.
WOMAN:
He's
ready
to
see
you
now.
Thank
you
for
seeing
us.
My
men
were
attacked
earlier
today.
I'm
going
to
need
to
see
all
cameras
in
and
around
Waterloo
station.
Will
somebody
-
that
requires
clearance?
Terry,
bring
up
cameras
58
through
62,
earlier
today.
They've
been
down
for
maintenance
Sorry.
Okay.
Well,
we
appreciate
your
help.

You
know
what
I
find
very
interesting
is
Interpol
was
attacked
recently
as
well.
Those
cameras
were
down,
too.
Nothing.
Now,
that
means
either
your
maintenance
schedule
lines
up
perfectly
with
their
escape
route
or
it's
someone
here

Because
there
ain't
no
way
in
hell
anybody
here
would
be
working
for
them.
Particularly
you,

That
is
ridiculous.
I'm
going
to
need
direct
access
citywide.
And
I
also
strongly
suggest
"maintenance."
Yeah,
of
course.
We
appreciate
your
help.

STASIAK:
Well,
well,
well.
The
orange
in
that
Thanks,
fellas.
Tell
me
something,
how
is
it
you
keep
breaking
every
law
and
yet
here
I
am,
You'll
feel
a
lot
better
Oh,
I'm
tempted
Well,
you
know
what
if
you
want
the
you
got
to
be
willing
and
sail
out
You're
an
asshole,
I
missed
you,
too,
man.

STASIAK:
I
got
you
admitted
into
Victorville
It's
a
24-hour
hold.
You
need
to
be
out
That's
when
Forensics
will
run
your
That
program
will
match
you
and
when
they
find
out
I
won't
be
able
to
We're
talking
life
in
prison.
Cute
kid.
So,
I
found
out
Braga's
being
held
That's
solitary.
I
only
had
enough
juice
So
you're
going
to
have
to
Sorry
about
this,
man.
Sorry
about
what?

Again?
Big
Brother's

Damn,
you
can't
flick
a
booger
in
London


Hey!
Don't
touch
that.
ROME:
What's
the
problem?
That's
high-tensile
What
does
that
mean?
That's
what
they
use
stuff
you
know
See,
now,
their
version,
but
mine,
masterpiece.
See,
I
reversed
the
gears,
and
added
this
tank
That
makes
it
even
sweeter.
It
does.
It's
not
dummy-proof.
Man,
I've
been
known
to
handle
big
guns.
TEJ:
You've
been
Dom,
I
did
some
checking,
got
the
location
of

BRAGA:
Brian
O'Conner.
That
was
quite
an
entrance.
You
put
a
lot
of
What?
I've
kept
tabs
on
you,
you
know.
You've
been
having
a
lot
of
fun
out
there.
Good
cop
gone
bad,
It's
exciting
when
you
go
criminal,
isn't
it?
Too
bad
you
didn't
do
it
earlier,
Like
Letty
Ortiz?
So
tell
me
something,
Yeah?
You
did?
You
buried
something,
I
know
she's
running
with
Owen
Shaw.
Still
playing
cop,
huh?
Trust
me,
this
is
way
above
your
pay
grade.

Humor
me,
please.
Well,
you're
a
dead
man
walking,
I
ran
everything
for
Shaw.
Drugs,
guns,
money,
women.
He
taught
me
to
think
global
He
made
me
a
wealthy
man.
And
this
guy
didn't
just
have
He
had
the
CIA,
DEA,
He
knew
what
was
In
fact,
he
even
knew
when
decided
to
put
some
informant
in
my
cartel.

The
minute
you
put
Letty
undercover,


But
she
survived.
That
girl
is
one
tough
bitch.
Shaw
found
her
He
went
to
finish
the
job.
And
he
didn't
kill
her.
Why?
She
had
no
memory.
Perfect
girl,
huh?
You're
lucky
this
door's
between
us.
What
happened
to
Letty


Look
at
me!
Look
at
me.

You
won't
do
it.
-

What
is
Shaw
up
to?
How
do
you
think
he
knows
your
next
move
He's
got
eyes
on
you.
Think
about
it.
The
only
way
you
get
close
to
Shaw
is
if
he
wants
you
there.

You've
got
some
I've
been
told.
You
know,
you're
lucky
I
missed
my
shot.
I
think
you
hit
your
mark.
Really?
What
is
it
with
you?
Do
you
got
a
death
wish
or
something?
If
that's
what
it
takes.
I
just
want
to
race.
You
might
lose
your
car.

Let's
do
it.
Your
funeral.
Ride
or
die,
remember?

Listen
up!
Out
here,
we're
used
This
is
London,
baby.

But
remember,
don't
bite
the
bait.
Are
you
ready?
-
Ready?

Steady.
Go!



Just
like
old
times.
This
guy
is
crazy.
You
got
to
be
kidding
me.
You're
still
upshifting
early.
I
do
that
so
you
brake.
You
lose
traction
I
noticed.
Look,
just
because
you
know
how
I
ride,
You
know
what
they
say
Show
me
how
you
drive,
V8.
You
never
could
resist
Nice
scar.
You
never
could
What
else
do
you
know
about
me?
About
you?
Everything.
Like
this
scar.
You
got
that
the
first
night
we
met.
First
street
race.
Some
kid
trying
to
show
off
wiped
out
right
next
to
you.
You're
lucky
you
didn't
lose
your
arm.
And
let
me
guess,
you
saved
me.
No.
I
was
the
kid
showing
off.
And
here...
Boyle
Heights.
You
were
fleeing
with
my
little
sister
Mia
And
you
thought
to
ride
your
Torino
Cobra

All
right,
how
about
this
one?
That's
the
last
time
we
were
together.
In
the
DR.
You
wanted
to
go
for
a
night
swim.
You
cut
yourself
on
the
reef.
I
followed
you.
I
even
got
this
scar
to
match.

Look,
I
don't
know
why
you're
here,
but
I
really
think
you're
over
your
head.
I'm
here
for
you.
That
girl
you
remember,
it's
not
me.
Not
from
what
I
just
saw.
Like
it
or
not,
you're
still
the
same
girl.
I
saw
it
out
there.
I
see
it
right
now.
I
got
to
go.
Hey.
It
belongs
to
you.


There
she
goes,
leaving
you
again.
Bloody
fickle,
that
one.
You
want
bloody?

A
street
kid,
starts
out
stealing
DVD
players
in
East
L.A.,
ends
up
heisting
$100
million
in
Rio.
Not
bad,
huh?
It's
a
good
story,
isn't
it?
Almost
inspiring.
See,
what
I
couldn't
fathom
is
why
he's
not
relaxing
on
a
beach
somewhere
with
that
cute
little
Brazilian
number.
Instead,
he's
working
with
And
then
I
realized,
he
has
a
weak
spot.
We
all
got
a
weak
spot.
You
know,
when
I
was
young,
"Every
man
has
to
have
a
code."
Mine?
Precision.
A
team
is
nothing
but
pieces
you
switch
It's
efficient.
It
works.
But
you?

You're
loyal
to
a
fault.
Your
code
is
about
family.

And
that's
great
in
the
holidays,
And
in
our
line
of
work,
And
that
means
I
can
reach
out
At
least
when
I
go,
Well,
at
least
you
have
a
code.

Most
men
don't.
So,
I'm
going
to
give
you
a
chance.
Take
your
crew
and
walk
away.
That's
the
only
way
Your
brother
never
told
you
never
It's
a
pretty
stupid
thing
to
do.

But
I'll
make
it
simple
for
you.
I
walk
away
when
she
walks
away.
Well,
then,
it
appears
this
inspiring
tale
If
that's
the
way
it
has
to
go.

Let
me
guess...
Hobbs.
Come
on,
you
son
of
a
bitch.
The
"two-bit
government
hack."

See
you
around,
Toretto.
You
can
bet
on
it.
-

Riley,
Shaw's
leaving
Battersea,
Have
Tej
track
him
on
his
live
feed.
Go.
You
know
what
if
I
didn't
put
that
tracker
in
your
car?
This
one?

You
know,
this
just
got
me
For
what
it's
worth,
Toretto,
I
hope
it
gets
you
closer
This
better
have
been
worth
it.
More
than
you'll
ever
know.

SHAW:
Pretty.
May
I?

I'm
going
to
ask
you
a
question,
Letty,
and
I
want
you
to
think
very
hard
When
I
give
you
the
order
to
take
Toretto
out,
what
will
your
first
thought
be?
Why
don't
you
look
me
in
the
eye
and
you
tell
me
what
you
see.

Keep
it.
Tej,
talk
to
me,
what
have
we
got?
We
were
able
to
track
Shaw
but
this
guy's
smart,
He
seems
to
know
all
the
city's
blind
spots.
See,
we
lost
him
somewhere
in
here,
which
means
he
could
be
anywhere
within
that
half-a-mile
radius.
Maybe
if
we
cross-reference
No,
this
has
got
Shaw's
name
We've
got
vantage
points,
subways,
highways
Bad-ass
and
brains.
Woman,
you
keep
that
up,
All
right,
let's
go
nail
that
son
of
a
bitch.
They're
long
gone.
There's
nothing
here.

There's
never
nothing.
There's
always
something.
Let's
go,
guys.
Shaw,
everyone
is
in
place.
Good.
Send
him
in.

Yo,
it's
Hobbs.
What
have
you
got,
Parker?
Yeah,
that
paint
you
got
from
Shaw's
place
Anti-thermal
low-IR
coating.
-
Military.
We
got
a
list
of
bases
around
Europe
and
those
specific
colors.
All
right,
with
all
of
Shaw's
I
guaran-damn-tee
you
Bingo.
That
puts
Shaw
in
a
different
country.
That
means
he's
got
an
eight-hour
lead
on
us.
HOBBS:
We
gotta
move
now.
Riley
and
I
will
go
ahead
We're
going
to
protect
Toretto,
I'll
arrange
transportation
for
you
You
brush
up
on
your
Spanish,
boys.

You
son
of
a
bitch!
You
made
it!

-
What
up,
man?
Good
to
see
you.
Figured
out
they're
hitting
an
army
base
Border
patrol
ID'ed
Shaw's
men
HAN:
Hobbs
and
Riley
went
-
They're
going
to
meet
us
there.
He
wasn't
going
without
you.
I
found
out
what
happened
to
Letty.
It's
all
my
fault.
Brian,
whatever
you
found
out,
What
we're
about
to
do
now
is
for
her.
NATO
COMMANDER:
sniper-spotters
in
roosts
Just
keep
all
your
men
out
of
sight.
When
they
drive
that
truck
in
here,
I
want
to
come
crashing
down
on
them
Hobbs,
I
just
caught
this
one
disabling
-
Your
house
is
compromised.
I
ain't
suggesting.
We
follow
protocol,
Shaw
thinks
it's
here.
We're
going
to
get
it
Stealth
and
speed
are
going
to
We're
going
to
protect
our
little
egg,
then
we're
going
to
wait
I
just
got
word
It's
time.
Something
is
not
right.
Think
about
it.
DOM:
Brian,
Braga
said
the
only
way
you
get
near
Shaw
Tej,
where's
that
component?
They're
moving
it
Shaw
ain't
hitting
that
base.
He's
hitting
the
convoy.
Let's
go!



We've
got
a
report,
Get
a
chopper,
now!

Fellas,
you
better
hurry
up.
And
Dom,
Letty's
with
them.
We
stick
to
the
plan.
All
right,
Let's
play
this
fast
and
clean.
That
thing's
heading
your
way.


All
systems
go.
Everything
looks
stable.
Uh,
guys,
They
got
a
tank.
I'm
sorry,
did
somebody
just
say
"a
tank"?
We
got
company,
guys.
Toretto
is
coming
right
at
you.
Okay.
Get
the
weapons
hot.
Give
me
satellite
imaging.



Straight
ahead
of
us.
There
you
are.
ROME:
Who's
got
a
plan
B?
Plan
B?
We
need
more
alphabets!
Hey,
we
do
We
improvise,
all
right?
Okay,
Jah.
Let's
have
some
fun.
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you?


Take
their
attention

Shaw,
you
don't
have
to
do
this.

We
got
one
right
Boom.
Oh,
shit!
-

You
lucky
bastard.
Roman,
you
hang
in
there.
Hang
in
there,
man!
Somebody
better
do
something!
There's
gotta
be
Oh,
look,
a
bridge.

Screw
it.



-
Yeah!
We're
dragging
a
car
behind
us.
Brian,
that
Mustang
would
Yeah,
I'm
on
it.

Damn!
Shaw,
we've
got
to
Letty,
go
take
care
Yeah!
What's
she
doing?
Shit!
Okay,
Toretto.
Here's
your
girl...
And
your
happy
ending.
Letty!


Jesus
Christ.
I
can't
believe
they
for
a
three-ounce
That
3-ounce
computer
chip
What
about
her?
Not
her.
She
was
working
with
Shaw.
Was,
but
she's
always
Let's
give
them
a
minute.
Let's
go
process
Shaw
and
his
crew.
I've
never
looked
more
forward
to
BRIAN:
Hey.
Look,
I
don't
even
know
but
everything
that's
happened
here
I'm
the
one
that
put
you
undercover...
Stop.
I
may
not
remember
anything,
but
I
know
one
thing
about
myself.
Nobody
makes
me
do
anything
So,
what's
our
next
adventure
after
this?
How
about
we
stay
in
one
place?
Where
are
you
thinking?
Tokyo.
We
always
talk
about
Tokyo.
Tokyo
it
is.

Can
I
ask
you
something?
How
did
you
know
that
there
would
I
didn't.
Some
things
you
just
Hey,
Toretto!
You
need
to
hear
this.
You
guys
really
This
code
you
live
by,
it's
the
very
reason
I
told
you
exactly
what
I
was
gonna
do
Go!
But
you
didn't
listen.
I
told
you
I
can
reach
out
And
I
have.
Come
on.
-
Go.
Maybe
you
should
call
Mia.



-
Mia?

Let
me
go!


So,
this
is
how
it's
gonna
go
down.
You're
gonna
cut
me
loose
from
these
cuffs,
you're
gonna
hand
me
the
chip,
I'm
gonna
walk
out
of
here
NATO
COMMANDER:
Look
at
his
face.
Ask
him
if
I'm
joking.
One
hostage
does
not
outweigh
I'm
sorry,

It
changes
everything.
You
tell
your
men
to
stand
down.
Stand
down.
HOBBS:
Toretto,
I
need
you
to
know,
the
moment
we
let
him
words
like
"amnesty"
and
"pardon"
walk
out
with
him.
Those
words
went
out

Coming,
babe?
Of
course.
I
wouldn't
miss
it
for
the
world.
SHAW:
Like
I
said,
you
were
never
in
the
game.
If
I
see
you
on
the
horizon,

So,
what
about
Toretto's
sister?

There's
no
need
for
her
anymore.

I
just
jammed
every
signal
Let's
move.
I'm
coming
with
you.
Where
the
hell
does
this
dude
We're
on
an
army
base,
Wow,
you
just
had
Now
we
got
a
big-ass
plane
to
deal
with.
That
ain't
a
plane.
That's
a
planet.


She's
as
good
as
dead
Then
we
don't
let
him
get
away.
Let's
end
this
thing.
Ride
or

Good

The
air
quality

Any

familiar
to
you?
No.
But
