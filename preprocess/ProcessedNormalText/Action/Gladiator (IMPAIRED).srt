Sir.
SOLDIER
1:
General.

Sir.
Lean
and
hungry.
-
Still
nothing?
MAXIMUS:
How
long
has
he
been
gone?
Will
they
fight,
sir?
We
shall
know
soon
enough.
Soldier,
I
ordered
you
-
They're
out
of
range.
-
The
danger
to
the
cavalry...


They
say
no.


People
should
know

Would
you,
Quintus?
Would
I?



Strength
and
honor.
At
my
signal,
unleash
hell.
Load
the
catapults.
Infantry
form
up
for
advance.
QUINTUS:
Archers
ready.
Nock!


Fratres!
SOLDIERS:

Maximus!
MAXIMUS:
Three
weeks
from
now,
Imagine
where
you
will
be,
and
it
will
be
so.
MAXIMUS:
Hold
the
line!
Stay
with
me!
If
you
find
yourself
alone...
riding
in
green
fields
do
not
be
troubled.
For
you
are
in
Elysium,

MAXIMUS:
Brothers...
what
we
do
in
life...
echoes
in
eternity.

Pull!
SOLDIER
2:
Catapults
ready,
sir!
Archers,
ignite!
Ignite!

SOLDIER
2:
Archers,
draw!
Loose!



SOLDIER
2:
All
right,
men,
ready!
MAXIMUS:
Hold
the
line!

SOLDIER
3:
Loose!
SOLDIER
3:
Reload!
MAXIMUS:
Hold
the
line!
-
Draw!
MAXIMUS:
Stay
with
me!
MAXIMUS:
Stay
with
me!

MAXIMUS:
Roma
victor!






Roma
victor!

COMMODUS:
Do
you
think
he's
really
dying?
He's
been
dying
for
10
years.
If
he
weren't
really
dying,
Maybe
he
just
misses
us.
And
the
senators?
Peace,
Commodus.
After
two
weeks
on
the
road,
He's
made
his
decision.
He
will
name
me.
The
first
thing
I
shall
do
when...
Is
honor
him
with
games
For
now,
the
first
thing
I
shall
do

GUARD:
Your
Highness?
GUARD:
We
seem
to
be
almost
there,
sire.

SOLDIER:
Sire.
He's
at
the
front,
sire.
The
wounded
are
still
coming
in.
My
horse.
SOLDIER
2:
My
lord.
Kiss?

You
have
proved
your
valor
yet
again,
Let
us
hope,
for
the
last
time.
There's
no
one
left
to
fight,
sire.
There
is
always
someone
left
to
fight.
How
can
I
reward
Rome's
greatest
general?
Let
me
go
home.
Home.


They
honor
you,
Caesar.
It's
for
you,
Maximus.
They
honor
you.

Have
I
missed
it?
Have
I
missed
the
battle?
You
have
missed
the
war.
Father,
congratulations.
I
shall
sacrifice
100
bulls
Save
the
bulls.
Honor
Maximus.
He
won
the
battle.
COMMODUS:
General.
Rome
salutes
you,
It
has
been
too
long,
my
old
friend.
Highness.
Here,
Father.
Take
my
arm.
I
think
it
is
time
for
me
to
leave.
So
much
for
the
glory
of
Rome.



Magnificent
battle.

General.
Still
alive?
QUINTUS:
Still
alive.
The
gods
must
have
a
sense
of
humor.
QUINTUS:
The
gods
must
love
you.
Back
to
barracks,
General?
Or
to
Rome?
Home.
My
wife,
my
son,
the
harvest.
Maximus
the
farmer.
You
know,
dirt
cleans
off
-
Here
he
is.
COMMODUS:
Senator
Gaius,
Senator
Falco.
Beware
of
Gaius.
and
you'll
wake
up
one
day
and
all
Well,
why
not?
Yes,
and
in
a
republic
But
Senator
Gaius
Where
do
you
stand,
General?
A
soldier
has
the
advantage
of
being
able
Well,
with
an
army
behind
you,
I
warned
you.
Now
I
shall
save
you.

Maximus.
I'm
going
to
need
good
men
like
you.
How
may
I
be
of
service,
Highness?
You're
a
man
who
knows
what
it
is
You
give
your
orders,
the
orders
are
obeyed,
But
these
senators
scheme,
squabble
COMMODUS:
We
must
save
Rome
Can
I
count
on
you
when
the
time
comes?
Highness,
when
your
father
releases
me,
Home?
Well,
no
one's
earned
it
more.
Don't
get
too
comfortable.
COMMODUS:
Lucilla's
here.
Did
you
know?
She's
not
forgotten
you.
And
now,
you're
the
great
man.
If
only
you
had
been
born
a
man...
what
a
Caesar
you
would
have
made.
Father.

You
would
have
been
strong.
I
wonder,
would
you
have
been
just?
I
would
have
been
How
was
your
journey?
Long.
Uncomfortable.
Why
have
I
come?
I
need
your
help.
With
your
brother.
Of
course.
He
loves
you.
He
always
has.
And...
he
will
need
you
now,
more
than
ever.
Enough
of
politics.
Let
us
pretend
and
I
am
a
good
father.

This
is
a
pleasant
fiction,
isn't
it?

SOLDIER:
Good
morning.

SOLDIER
2:
I
need
three
more
horses.
Two!
Three!
SOLDIER
7:
Four!
SOLDIER
3:
One!
Two!
MAXIMUS:
You
sent
for
me,
Caesar?
-
Caesar?
Why
are
we
here?
For
the
glory
of
the
empire,
sire.
Yes.
Yes,
I
remember.
Do
you
see
that
map,
Maximus?
That
is
the
world
which
I
created.
For
25
years...
I
have
conquered,
spilt
blood,
Since
I
became
Caesar,
Four
years
of
peace
in
20.
And
for
what?

I
brought
the
sword.
Nothing
more.
Caesar,
your
life...
Please.
Please
don't
call
me
that.
Come.
Please.
Come
sit.
Let
us
talk
together
now...
very
simply,
as
men.
Well,
Maximus...
talk.
5,000
of
my
men
are
out
there
3,000
of
them
are
bloodied
and
cleaved.
I
will
not
believe
that
they
fought
CAESAR:
And
what
would
you
believe?
They
fought
for
you
and
for
Rome.
And
what
is
Rome,
Maximus?
I've
seen
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world.
It
is
brutal
and
cruel
and
dark.
Yet
you
have
never
been
there.
You
have
not
seen
what
it
has
become.
I
am
dying,
Maximus.
When
a
man
sees
his
end...
he
wants
to
know
there
was
some
purpose
How
will
the
world
speak
my
name
Will
I
be
known
as
the
philosopher?
The
warrior?
The
tyrant?
Or
will
I
be
the
Emperor
CAESAR:
There
was
once
a
dream
You
could
only
whisper
it.
Anything
more
than
a
whisper
it
was
so
fragile.
And
I
fear
that
it
will
not
survive
the
winter.
CAESAR:
Maximus...
let
us
whisper
now...
together,
you
and
I.
You
have
a
son.
Tell
me
about
your
home.

My
house
is
in
the
hills
above
Trujillo.
A
very
simple
place.
Pink
stones
that
warm
in
the
sun.
A
kitchen
garden
jasmine
in
the
evening.
Through
the
gate
is
a
giant
poplar.
Figs,
apples,
pears.
The
soil,
Marcus,
black.
Grapes
on
the
south
slopes,
Wild
ponies
play
near
my
house.
He
wants
to
be
one
of
them.
When
was
the
last
time
you
were
home?
Two
years,
264
days
and
this
morning.
I
envy
you,
Maximus.
It's
a
good
home.
Worth
fighting
for.
CAESAR:
There
is
one
more
duty...
that
I
ask
of
you
before
you
go
home.
What
would
you
have
me
do,
Caesar?
CAESAR:
I
want
you
to
become
I
will
empower
you
to
one
end
alone...
to
give
power
back
to
the
people
of
Rome...
and
end
the
corruption
that
has
crippled
it.

Will
you
accept
this
great
honor
With
all
my
heart,
no.
Maximus...
that
is
why
it
must
be
you.
But
surely
a
prefect,
a
senator...
somebody
who
knows
the
city,
CAESAR:
But
you
have
not
been
corrupted
-
And
Commodus?
You
have
known
that
since
you
were
young.
CAESAR:
Commodus
cannot
rule.
CAESAR:
He
must
not
rule.
You
are
the
son
that
I
should
have
had.
Commodus
will
accept
my
decision.
He
knows
that
you
command

I
need
some
time,
sire.
Yes.
By
sunset,
I
hope
you
will
have
agreed.
Now
embrace
me
as
my
son.
And
bring
an
old
man
another
blanket.
LUCILLA:
My
father
favors
you
now.
-
It
was
not
always
so.
Many
things.
Not
everything.
LUCILLA:
Maximus,
stop.
Let
me
see
your
face.
LUCILLA:
You
seem
upset.
What
did
my
father
want
with
you?
To
wish
me
well
before
I
leave
for
home.
You're
lying.
I
could
always
tell
when
you
were
lying
-
I
never
acquired
your
comfort
with
it.
But
then
you
never
had
to.
Life
is
more
simple
for
a
soldier.
Or
do
you
think
me
heartless?
I
think
you
have
a
talent
for
survival.

Maximus,
stop.
Is
it
really
so
terrible
seeing
me
again?
No.
I'm
tired
from
battle.
LUCILLA:
It
hurts
you
to
see
Commodus
expects
that
my
father
will
Will
you
serve
my
brother

I
will
always
serve
Rome.
Do
you
know...
I
still
remember
you
in
my
prayers.
Oh,
yes.
I
pray.
I
was
sad
to
hear
of
your
husband's
death.
-
Thank
you.
Yes.
Lucius.
He'll
be
nearly
eight
years
old.
My
son
is
also
nearly
eight.
MAXIMUS:
I
thank
you
for
your
prayers.
MAXIMUS:
Ancestors,
Blessed
Mother,
come
to
me
Blessed
Father,
watch
over
my
wife
and
son
MAXIMUS:
Whisper
to
them,
Ancestors,
I
honor
you...
and
will
try
to
live

MAXIMUS:
Cicero.
Sir.
Do
you
ever
find
it
hard
to
do
your
duty?
Sometimes
I
do
what
I
want
to
do.
The
rest
of
the
time,
I
do
what
I
have
to.
We
may
not
be
able
to
go
home,
after
all.


CAESAR:
Are
you
ready
to
do
your
duty
Yes,
Father.
You
will
not
be
emperor.
Which
wiser,
older
man
is
to
take
my
place?
My
powers
will
pass
to
Maximus...
to
hold
in
trust...
until
the
Senate
is
ready
to
rule
once
more.
Rome
is
to
be
a
republic
again.
COMMODUS:
Maximus.
My
decision
disappoints
you?
You
wrote
to
me
once...
listing
the
four
chief
virtues:
Wisdom...
justice...
fortitude...
and
temperance.
As
I
read
the
list,
I
knew
I
had
none
of
them.
But
I
have
other
virtues,
Father.
Ambition.
That
can
be
a
virtue
COMMODUS:
Resourcefulness,
courage.
Perhaps
not
on
the
battlefield,
Devotion
to
my
family...
to
you.
But
none
of
my
virtues
were
on
your
list.

Even
then
it
was
as
if
Commodus...
you
go
too
far.
I
searched
the
faces
of
the
gods...
for
ways
to
please
you,
to
make
you
proud.
One
kind
word...
one
full
hug...
where
you
pressed
me
to
your
chest
would
have
been
like
the
sun
on
my
heart
COMMODUS:
What
is
it
in
me
you
hate
Commodus.
All
I've
ever
wanted...
was
to
live
up
to
you,
Caesar.
COMMODUS:
Father.
your
faults
as
a
son...
is
my
failure
as
a
father.
Come.

Father.

I
would
butcher
the
whole
world...
if
you
would
only
have
loved
me!






Maximus,
the
Emperor
needs
you.
Lament
with
me,
brother.
Our
great
father
is
dead.

MAXIMUS:
How
did
he
die?
COMMODUS:
The
surgeons
say
His
breath
gave
out
as
he
slept.
MAXIMUS:
Father.
Your
emperor
asks
for
your
loyalty,
Take
my
hand.
I
only
offer
it
once.
MAXIMUS:
Quintus.



Hail,
Caesar.
I
must
talk
to
the
senators.
-
Wake
Gaius
and
Falco.
Sword.
QUINTUS:
Maximus,
please
be
careful.
Prudent?
The
Emperor
has
been
slain.
QUINTUS:
The
Emperor
died
-
Why
are
you
armed,
Quintus?
Please
don't
fight,
Maximus.
I'm
sorry.
Caesar
has
spoken.
Ride
until
dawn...
and
then
execute
him.
Quintus,
look
at
me.
Look
at
me!
Promise
me
Your
family
will
meet
you
in
the
afterlife.
GUARD:
Kneel.
MAXIMUS:
Blessed
Father,
Whisper
to
them
At
least
give
me
a
clean
death.
A
soldier's
death.


The
frost,

Praetorian!





CAESAR:
When
was
the
last
time
MAXIMUS:
Two
years,
Blessed
Father,
I
will
try
to
live
Whisper
to
them,
...
with
a
ready
sword,
Whisper
to
them,
For
all
else
is
dust
and
air.



Papa!










Don't
die.

JUBA:
You'll
meet
them
again.
Not
yet.

No.
They
will
clean
it.
Wait
and
see.


Don't
die.
They'll
feed
you
to
the
lions.
They
are
worth
more
than
we
are.
Better
now?
Clean.
You
see?

SLAVE
TRADER:
Proximo!
My
old
friend.
Every
day
is
a
great
day
when
you
are
here...
but
today
is
your
most
fortunate
day.

Those
giraffes
you
sold
me,
They
just
walk
around
eating
You
sold
me
queer
giraffes.
-
I
want
my
money
back.

SLAVE
TRADER:
I
do
special
price
for
you.
Have
you
seen
my
new
stock?
PROXIMO:
Do
any
of
them
fight?
Some
are
good
for
fighting,
You
need
both,
I
think.
Get
up.
PROXIMO:
What's
your
trade?
I
was
a
hunter.
No,
I
bought
him
from
a
salt
mine
Sit
down.
PROXIMO:
Mark
of
the
legion.
PROXIMO:
Deserter.
He's
a
Spaniard.
I'll
take
six.
For
1,000.
One
thousand?
PROXIMO:
These
slaves
are
rotten.
It
all
adds
to
the
flavor.
No,
wait!
I
can
negotiate.
I'll
give
you
2,000,
and
4,000
for
the
beasts.
That's
5,000
for
an
old
friend.
Come
on!
How
long
does
it
take
PROXIMO:
I
am
Proximo.
I
shall
be
closer
to
you
which
will
be
the
last
than
that
bitch
of
a
mother
I
did
not
pay
good
money
for
you
I
paid
it
so
that
I
could
profit
And
as
your
mother
was
there
so
I
shall
be
there
at
your
end.

And
when
you
die,
and
die
you
shall...
your
transition
shall
be
to
the
sound
of...

Gladiators...
I
salute
you.
PROXIMO:
Red.
HAGEN:
Yellow.
Yellow.

HAGEN:
Good.
Red.
HAGEN:
Spaniard.



PROXIMO:
That's
enough
for
the
moment!
His
time
will
come.
Next.

Spaniard...
why
don't
you
fight?
We
all
have
to
fight.
SCRIBE:
Well,
I
don't
fight.
I
shouldn't
be
here,
I'm
a
scribe,
and
speak
seven
languages.
HAGEN:
Good.
Tomorrow,
you
can
scream

HAGEN:
Perhaps
the
scribe
will
be
the
one
Freedom?
What
do
I
have
to
do?
You
go
in
the
arena
and
you
kill
me.
And
him...
and
the
Numidian...
and
the
deserter.
HAGEN:
And
100
more.
And
when
there's
no
more
to
fight,
I
can't
do
that.
No?

But
I
can.
Is
that
the
sign
of
your
gods?
Will
that
not
anger
them?


The
gods
favor
you.
Red
is
the
gods'
color.
You
will
need
their
help
today.


Proximo!
Still
leading
with
the
German?
The
crowd
love
a
barbarian.
Besides
that,
he's
making
me
rich.
Has
that
Numidian
fought
before?
No,
first
time.
MAN
1:
And
that
one,
laborer,
soldier?
He's
a
Spaniard.
He
might
as
well
Five
hundred
sestertii,
the
Numidian
And
1,000,
Are
you
asking
me
It's
unethical.
What
if
I
make
it
2,000?


Some
of
you
are
thinking
you
won't
fight...
some
that
you
can't
fight.
They
all
say
that
until
they're
out
there.
Listen.
CROWD:
Kill!

Thrust
this
into
another
man's
flesh...
and
they
will
applaud
and
love
you
for
that.
And
you...
you
may
begin
to
love
them...
for
that.
Ultimately,
we're
all
dead
men.

Sadly,
we
cannot
choose
how...
but
we
can
decide
how
we
meet
that
end...
in
order
that
we
are
remembered...
as
men.
Come
on!

HAGEN:
On
the
left,
draw
your
shields!
On
the
right,
draw
your
swords!
CROWD:
Kill!
Kill!
Pair
them
up:
red
with
yellow.
MAN
2:
Next!
HAGEN:
Move!






MAN
3:
Usurper!

MAN
4:
Go
away!
He
enters
Rome
like
a
conquering
hero.
Give
him
time,
Gracchus.
He's
young.
I
think
he
could
do
very
well.
GRACCHUS:
For
Rome,
or
for
you?

GRACCHUS:
Go
to
your
mother,
Lucius.
LUCILLA:
Lucius!
BOY
1:
Hail,
Caesar.
Senators.
Rome
greets
her
new
emperor.
Your
loyal
subjects
bid
you
welcome,
Thank
you,
Falco.
And
for
the
loyal
subjects,
GRACCHUS:
Caesar.
All
Rome
rejoices
in
your
return,
Caesar.
There
are
many
matters
GRACCHUS:
To
order,
please.
To
order.
For
your
guidance,
Caesar,
the
Senate
to
begin
addressing
the
many
problems
beginning
with
basic
sanitation
to
combat
the
plague
GRACCHUS:
So,
if
Caesar...
Don't
you
see,
Gracchus?
That's
the
very
problem,
isn't
it?
COMMODUS:
My
father
spent
all
his
time
at
books
of
learning
and
philosophy.
COMMODUS:
He
spent
his
twilight
hours
And
all
the
while,
the
people
were
forgotten.
But
the
Senate
is
the
people,
sire...
chosen
from
among
the
people
I
doubt
many
of
the
people
Or
have
such
splendid
mistresses,
Gaius.
I
think
I
understand
my
own
people.
Then
perhaps
Caesar
will
be
so
good
out
of
his
own
extensive
experience.

I
call
it
love.
I
am
their
father.
I
shall
hold
them
to
my
bosom
Have
you
ever
embraced
No,
but
if
you
interrupt
me
again...
I
assure
you
that
you
shall.
Senator,
my
brother
is
very
tired.
Leave
your
list
with
me.
My
lady,
as
always,
COMMODUS:
Who
are
they
to
lecture
me?
Commodus,
the
Senate
has
its
uses.
What
uses?
All
they
do
is
talk.
It
should
be
just
you
and
me
and
Rome.
Don't
even
think
it.
COMMODUS:
Rome
has
changed.
It
takes
an
emperor
to
rule
an
empire.
Of
course,
but
leave
the
people
their...
COMMODUS:
Illusions?
Traditions.
My
father's
war
against
the
barbarians...
He
said
it
himself:
it
achieved
nothing.
The
people
always
love
victories.
Why?
They
didn't
see
the
battles.
What
do
they
care
about
Germania?
They
care
about
the
greatness
of
Rome.
"The
greatness
of
Rome."
Well,
what
is
that?
It's
an
idea.
Greatness.
LUCILLA:
Greatness
is
a
vision.
Do
you
not
see,
Lucilla?
I
will
give
the
people
a
vision
of
Rome,
And
they'll
soon
forget
the
tedious
I
will
give
the
people


TRADER:
White
and
red
wine
Games.
One
hundred
and
fifty
days
of
games.
He's
cleverer
than
I
thought.
Clever.
The
whole
of
Rome
if
they
weren't
so
afraid
of
his
Praetorians.
Fear
and
wonder.
A
powerful
combination.
You
really
think
the
people
I
think
he
knows
what
Rome
is.
Conjure
magic
for
them,
Take
away
their
freedom,
The
beating
heart
of
Rome
It's
the
sand
of
the
Colosseum.
He'll
bring
them
death...
and
they
will
love
him
for
it.


All
you
do
is
kill,
kill,
kill.
The
crowd
don't
want
a
butcher,
We
want
them
to
keep
coming
back.
So
don't
just
hack
them
to
pieces,
MAN:
Spaniard.
So
entertain!

Are
you
not
entertained?

Is
this
not
why
you're
here?
CROWD:
Spaniard!


What
do
you
want?
Girl?
Boy?
-
You
sent
for
me.
You're
good,
Spaniard,
PROXIMO:
You
could
be
magnificent.
I'm
required
to
kill,
so
I
kill.
That
is
enough.
That's
enough
for
the
provinces,
The
young
emperor
to
commemorate
his
father,
I
find
that
amusing...
since
it
was
Marcus
Aurelius,
the
wise...
the
all-knowing
Marcus
Aurelius,
So
finally,
in
flea-infested
villages...
we're
finally
going
back
to
where
we
belong:
the
Colosseum.
You
should
see
the
Colosseum,
Spaniard.
Fifty-thousand
Romans...
watching
every
movement
of
your
sword...
willing
you
to
make
that
killer
blow.
The
silence
before
you
strike
It
rises.
It
rises
up...
like
a
storm.
As
if
you
were
the
thunder
god
himself.
-
You
were
a
gladiator?

You
won
your
freedom?
A
long
time
ago,
the
Emperor...
presented
me
with
a
rudius.
It's
just
a
wooden
sword.
The
symbol
of
your
freedom.
He
touched
me
on
the
shoulder,

You
knew
Marcus
Aurelius?
I
did
not
say
I
knew
him.
MAXIMUS:
You
asked
me
what
I
want.
I,
too,
want
to
stand
as
you
did.
PROXIMO:
Then
listen
to
me.
Learn
from
me.
I
wasn't
the
best
because
I
killed
quickly.
I
was
the
best
because
the
crowd
loved
me.
Win
the
crowd,
and
you'll
win
your
freedom.

I
will
win
the
crowd.
I
will
give
them
something

PROXIMO:
So,
Spaniard,
and
have
bloody
adventures.
PROXIMO:
And
the
great
whore
until
we
are
fat
and
happy
And
then...
when
enough
men
have
died...
perhaps
you
will
have
your
freedom.
Here.
Use
this.

JUBA:
It's
somewhere
out
there,
my
country.
My
home.
JUBA:
My
wife
is
preparing
food.
My
daughters
carry
water
from
the
river.
Will
I
ever
see
them
again?
I
think,
no.
Do
you
believe
you'll
see
them
again
I
think
so.
But
then,
I
will
die
soon.
They
will
not
die
for
many
years.
JUBA:
I'll
have
to
wait.
But
you
would?
Wait?
Of
course.
You
see...
my
wife...
and
my
son
are
already
waiting
for
me.
You'll
meet
them
again.
But
not
yet.
Not
yet.
-
Unless...
Not
yet.


BOY
2:
There
he
is.

MAN:
Out.
Move,
go,
out!
PROXIMO:
Good
to
see
you
again,
Bring
me
fortune.

Have
you
ever
seen
anything
I
didn't
know
men
could
build
such
things.
Win
the
crowd.
MAN:
Get
inside.
Move.
Inside.


He
sleeps
so
well
because
he's
loved.
Come,
brother.
It's
late.
COMMODUS:
I
will
make
Rome
That
is
what
Gracchus
and
his
friends
COMMODUS:
All
my
desires
Commodus,
drink
this
tonic.
COMMODUS:
I
think
the
time
is
almost
right.
I
could
announce
at
the
celebration
to
honor
our
father.
COMMODUS:
Do
you
think
I
should?
COMMODUS:
Are
the
people
ready?
I
think
you
need
your
rest
now.

Will
you
stay
with
me?
Still
afraid
of
the
dark,
brother?
Still.
Always.
-
Stay
with
me
tonight.
Then
kiss
me.
Sleep,
brother.


Having
servants
who
are
deaf
and
mute...
at
least
ensures
I
live
a
little
longer.
LUCILLA:
They're
arresting
scholars
now.
Anyone
who
dare
speak
out.
GAIUS:
And
mathematicians.
And
all
to
feed
the
arena.
The
Senate
did
not
approve
martial
law.
GAIUS:
This
reign
of
terror
GAIUS:
I'm
afraid
to
go
out
after
dark.
You
should
be
more
afraid
The
Senate
is
full
of
his
spies,
But
what
is
in
his
mind?
He
spends
all
his
days
planning
the
festival
to
honor
your
father.
He
neglects
even
the
most
fundamental
task
So
just
what
is
he
planning?
GAIUS:
And
what
pays
for
it?
These
daily
games
are
costing
a
fortune,
The
future.
The
future
pays
for
it.
He's
started
selling
the
grain
reserves.
GAIUS:
This
can't
be
true.
LUCILLA:
He's
selling
The
people
will
be
starving
in
two
years.
I
hope
they're
enjoying
the
games...
because
soon
enough
-
Rome
must
know
this.
He's
going
to
dissolve
the
Senate.
And
who
will
tell
them
before
it's
too
late?
LUCILLA:
You,
Gaius.
Will
you
make
a
speech
on
the
floor
And
then
see
your
family
in
the
Colosseum?
Who'd
dare?

LUCILLA:
I
have
been
living
because
my
son
is
heir
to
the
throne.

He
must
die.
GAIUS:
Quintus
and
the
Praetorians
No.
Cut
off
the
head
GRACCHUS:
Lucilla,
Gaius
is
right.
Until
we
can
neutralize
the
Praetorians,
So
we
do
nothing?
GRACCHUS:
No,
child.
We
keep
our
counsel.
We
prepare.
As
long
as
the
people
support
him,
We
are
air.
GRACCHUS:
But
with
every
day
that
passes,
One
day,
And
on
that
day,
we
will
act.
Then
we
will
strike.
But
until
then...
we
are
docile.
We
are
obedient.
And
we
are
treacherous.

MAN:
Come
on!
MAN:
All
right,
that's
enough.
The
Emperor
wants
battles,
and
I
don't
want
The
crowd
wants
battles,
-
You
get
the
battle
of
Carthage.
Well,
why
don't
you
go
down
to
the
prison,
We've
done
that.
If
you
want
to
give
away
the
best
gladiators
then
I
want
double
the
rates.
You'll
get
your
contract
rates,
You
don't
like
it?
Then
you
can
crawl
back
MAN:
Cassius,
please.
You
can
free
us.
Gladiator,
are
you
the
one
Yes.
LUCIUS:
They
said
you
were
a
giant.
They
said
you
could
crush
a
man's
skull
A
man's?
No.
A
boy's.
-
Do
they
have
good
horses
in
Spain?
This
is
Argento
and
this
is
Scarto.
They
were
my
horses.
They
were
taken
from
me.
I
like
you,
Spaniard.
I
shall
cheer
for
you.
-
They
let
you
watch
the
games?
-
And
what
does
your
father
say?
Master
Lucius,
it
is
time.
I
have
to
go.
Your
name
is
Lucius?
Lucius
Verus,
after
my
father.

MAN:
Lower!
SOLDIER:
Claudius!
CLAUDIUS:
Yes?
CLAUDIUS:
All
right.
SOLDIER:
When
the
Emperor
enters,
and
then
speak
together.
Face
the
Emperor
Go,
and
die
with
honor.




SOLDIER:
Hail,
mighty
Caesar!
CROWD:
Caesar!

GLADIATORS:
We
who
are
about
to
die
CASSIUS:
On
this
day...
we
reach
back
to
hallowed
antiquity...
to
bring
you
a
re-creation
of
mighty
Carthage!

On
the
barren
plain
of
Zama...
there
stood
the
invincible
armies...
of
the
barbarian
Hannibal.
CASSIUS:
Ferocious
mercenaries
from
all
brute
nations...
bent
on
merciless
destruction...
conquest.
Your
emperor
is
pleased
to
give
you...
the
barbarian
horde!

Anyone
here
been
in
the
army?
SOLDIER:
Yes.
I
served
with
you
You
can
help
me.
Whatever
comes
out
of
these
gates...
we've
got
a
better
chance
of
survival
Do
you
understand?
If
we
stay
together,
we
survive.
The
Emperor
is
pleased
to
bring
you
of
Scipio
Africanus!

To
the
death!
CROWD:
Kill!
Stay
close.
Come
together!
Stay
close.
Staggered
columns!
MAN:
You
don't
have
a
chance.


MAXIMUS:
Lock
your
shields.
Stay
as
one.
Hold!
Hold!
As
one!
Well
done.
Hold.
Down
low!
CROWD:
Yes!

Hagen!

This
column
to
the

MAXIMUS:
Quickly!
-
Get
out
there.




JUBA:
Maximus!

Single
column!




We
win!
My
history's
a
little
hazy,
Cassius...
but
shouldn't
the
barbarians
Yes,
sire.
Forgive
me,
sire.
COMMODUS:
No,
I
rather
enjoy
surprises.
Who
is
he?
They
call
him
the
Spaniard,
sire.
I
think
I'll
meet
him.
Yes,
sire.
MAN:
Hail
to
the
barbarians!

SOLDIER:
Forward!
Arms
at
ready!
Drop
your
weapons.

Gladiator,
the
Emperor
has
asked
for
you.
I
am
at
the
Emperor's
service.


Rise.
Your
fame
is
well
deserved,
Spaniard.
I
don't
think
there's
ever
been
a
gladiator
As
for
this
young
man,
Or
was
it
Hercules?
Why
doesn't
the
hero
reveal
himself

You
do
have
a
name.
My
name
is
Gladiator.
How
dare
you
show
your
back
to
me?
Slave!
You
will
remove
your
helmet

My
name
is
Maximus
Decimus
Meridius...
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
north...
general
of
the
Felix
Legions...
loyal
servant
to
the
true
emperor,
father
to
a
murdered
son...
husband
to
a
murdered
wife...
and
I
will
have
my
vengeance,
Arms!
CROWD:
Live!


SOLDIER:
Arms,
at
rest!



SOLDIERS:
Maximus!
Father.


Why
is
he
still
alive?
I
don't
know.
He
shouldn't
be
alive.
It
vexes
me.
I'm
terribly
vexed.
I
did
what
I
had
to
do.
If
Father
had
had
his
way,
You
do
see
that.
Yes.
What
did
you
feel
when
you
saw
him?
I
felt
nothing.
He
wounded
you
deeply,
didn't
he?
No
more
than
I
wounded
him.
They
lied
to
me
in
Germania.
They
told
me
he
was
dead.
If
they
lie
to
me,
they
don't
respect
me.
If
they
don't
respect
me,
Then
you
must
let
the
legions
know...
their
treachery
will
not
go
unpunished.
COMMODUS:
Poor
sister.
I
wouldn't
want
to
be
your
enemy.
What
will
you
do?

GUARD:
This
way.
Rich
matrons
pay
well
I
knew
your
brother
would
send
assassins.
I
didn't
realize
he
would
send
his
best.
Maximus,
he
doesn't
know.
My
family
was
burnt
and
crucified
-
I
knew
nothing...
I
wept
for
them.
As
you
wept
for
your
father?
I
have
been
living
in
a
prison
of
fear
To
be
unable
to
mourn
your
father
To
live
in
terror
because
your
son
is
heir
to
the
throne.
I
have
wept.
My
son
was
innocent.
So
is
mine.
Must
my
son
die,
too,
What
does
it
matter
if
I
trust
you
or
not?
LUCILLA:
The
gods
have
spared
you.
Today
I
saw
a
slave
become
more
powerful
The
gods
have
spared
me?
I
am
at
their
mercy,
LUCILLA:
That
is
power.
LUCILLA:
The
mob
is
Rome.
And
while
Commodus
controls
them,
Listen
to
me.
My
brother
has
enemies,
But
while
the
people
follow
him...
no
one
would
dare
stand
up
to
him
They
oppose
him,
yet
they
do
nothing.
There
are
some
politicians
One
man
above
all.
If
I
can
arrange
it,
will
you
meet
him?
Do
you
not
understand?
I
may
die
in
this
cell
tonight,
What
possible
difference
can
I
make?
This
man
wants
what
you
want.
Then
have
him
kill
Commodus!
I
knew
a
man
once...
a
noble
man.
A
man
of
principle
who
loved
my
father...
and
my
father
loved
him.
This
man
served
Rome
well.

That
man
is
gone.
Your
brother
did
his
work
well.
Let
me
help
you.
Yes,
you
can
help
me.
Forget
you
ever
knew
me,
Guard!
The
lady
is
finished
with
me.


What's
your
name?
Julian
Crassus.
Name?
Marcus,
sire.
COMMODUS:
My
father's
name.
They
must
have
known
of
Maximus'
escape
They
thought
it
was
a
barbarian
raid.
These
are
good
men,
sire.
SOLDIER:
Load
your
arrows!

SOLDIER:
Prepare
to
fire!

COMMODUS:
Then
perhaps
it
was
you
and
never
told
me.
-
I
didn't
know.
COMMODUS:
But
a
general
Always
in
command,
isn't
he?
Yes,
Caesar.


Then
give
the
command.
Say
it.
Fire.


HAGEN:
Maximus.
You
commanded
legions?
-
Yes.
In
many
countries.
MAN:
General.



You
have
a
great
name.
He
must
kill
your
name
before
he
kills
you.

Yes,
at
the
far
end.
GRACCHUS:
Senator
Gaius.
Senator
Gracchus.
Don't
often
see
you
enjoying
the
pleasures
I
don't
pretend
to
be
a
man
of
the
people,
but
I
do
try
to
be
a
man
for
the
people.

CROWD:
Caesar!
CASSIUS:
People
of
Rome!
On
the
fourth
day
of
Antioch...
we
can
celebrate
the
64th
day
of
the
games.
And
in
his
majestic
charity...
the
Emperor
has
deigned
this
day
with
an
historical
final
match.
Returning
to
the
Colosseum
today,
Caesar
is
pleased
to
bring
you...
the
only
undefeated
champion...
in
Roman
history:
the
legendary
Tigris
of
Gaul!

He
knows
too
well
Marcus
Aurelius
had
a
dream
This
is
not
it.
Marcus
Aurelius
is
dead,
Maximus.
We
mortals
are
but
shadows
and
dust.
Shadows
and
dust,
Maximus!
CASSIUS:
Representing
the
training
lyceum
Caesar
is
proud
to
give
you...
Aelius
Maximus!


They
embrace
him
The
mob
is
fickle,
brother.
No,
much
sooner
than
that.
It's
been
arranged.
We
who
are
about
to
die
salute
you.
MAN:
We're
with
you,

Fight
on,

it!

GUARDS:
Pull,

1:

Merciful!

CROWD:
Maximus!
SOLDIER:
Forward,
arms
at
ready!


COMMODUS:
What
am
I
going
to
do
You
simply
won't
die.
Are
we
so
different,
you
and
I?
You
take
life
when
you
have
to,
as
I
do.
I
have
only
one
more
life
to
take.
Then
take
it
now.
They
tell
me
your
son...
squealed
like
a
girl
And
your
wife...
moaned
like
a
whore...
when
they
ravaged
her
again
and
again...
and
again.

The
time
for
honoring
yourself
Highness.

CROWD:
Maximus!
CICERO:
General!
CICERO:
General!
-
Where
are
you
camped?
MAN:
We
love
you,
Maximus!
Tell
the
men
their
general
lives.
Find
me.
SOLDIER:
Move
along!

JUBA:
Can
they
hear
you?
-
Who?
MAXIMUS:
Yes.
To
my
boy...
I
tell
him
I
will
see
him
again
soon...
and
to
keep
his
heels
down
To
my
wife...
that
is
not
your
business.

And
now
they
love
Maximus
for
his
mercy.
So
I
can't
just
kill
him,
The
whole
thing
FALCO:
He
is
defying
you.
His
every
victory
is
an
act
of
defiance.
The
mob
sees
this,
and
so
do
the
Senate.
Every
day
he
lives,
they
grow
bolder.
-
Kill
him.
I
will
not
make
a
martyr
of
him.

When
I
went
to
the
Senate
today...
I
purposefully
told
them
about
using
And
did
you
note
what
happened?
-
Nothing.
COMMODUS:
Not
a
single
word
of
protest.
Even
the
insolent
Senator
Gracchus
Why?
I
have
been
told
of
a
certain
sea
snake...
which
has
a
very
unusual
method
It
will
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
Then
its
enemies
will
approach...
and
yet
it
will
lie
quite
still.
And
then
its
enemies
and
yet
it
remains
still.
So...
we
will
lie
still...
and
let
our
enemies
come
to
us
and
nibble.
Have
every
senator
followed.
Cicero,
my
old
friend.
I
thought
perhaps
CICERO:
I
thought
you
were
dead.
-
How
long
have
the
men
been
in
Ostia?
-
And
how
do
they
look?
MAXIMUS:
Who's
in
command?
How
soon
do
you
think
For
you,
tomorrow.
I
need
you
to
do
something
for
me.
ACTOR:
Come,
see,
witness.
If
you
haven't
been
in
the
arena,
Giant
Maximus
What
are
we
to
do?
by
doing
this
to
him,
they
do...
My
goodness!

ACTOR:
He
got
him,
he's
defeated.

My
lady?
I
served
your
father
at
Vindobona.
SOLDIER:
Back.
I
served
your
father
at
Vindobona.
SOLDIER:
Back!
And
I
served
General
Maximus.
Stop.
Stand
back.
The
General
sends
word,
-
For
your
loyalty,
soldier.
LUCILLA:
Leave
us.
Senator
Gracchus.
General.
I
hope
my
coming
here
today
that
you
can
trust
me.
-
The
Senate
is
with
you?
Yes.
I
can
speak
for
them.
You
can
buy
my
freedom
GRACCHUS:
To
what
end?
Get
me
outside
the
city
walls.
Have
fresh
horses
ready
to
take
me
to
Ostia.
By
nightfall
of
the
second
day,
LUCILLA:
But
the
legions
loyal
to
Commodus.
Let
my
men
see
me
alive,
This
is
madness.
No
Roman
army
has
entered
the
capital
I
will
not
trade
one
dictatorship
for
another!
The
time
for
half
measures
and
talk
is
over,
And
after
your
glorious
coup,
what
then?
You'll
take
your
5,000
warriors
and
leave?
I
will
leave.
The
soldiers
will
stay
for
your
protection
So...
once
all
of
Rome
is
yours,
Tell
me
why.
Because
that
was
the
last
wish
I
will
kill
Commodus.
The
fate
of
Rome
I
leave
to
you.
Marcus
Aurelius
trusted
you.
His
daughter
trusts
you.
I
will
trust
you.
But
we
have
little
time.
Give
me
two
days...
and
I
will
buy
your
freedom.
GRACCHUS:
And
you...
You
stay
alive...
or
I'll
be
dead.
Now
we
must
go.
GRACCHUS:
He'll
be
waiting
for
you.
He'll
find
you.

It
won't
work.
The
Emperor
knows
too
much.
And
as
for
me...
it's
becoming
dangerous.
You'll
be
paid
on
my
return.
I
give
you
my
word.
Your
word?
What
if
you
don't
return?
Do
you
remember
what
it
was
Trust?
Who
am
I
to
trust?
MAXIMUS:
I
will
kill
Commodus.
He
makes
me
rich.

I
know
that
you
are
a
man
of
your
word,
PROXIMO:
I
know
that
you
would
die
You
would
die
for
Rome.
You
would
die
for
the
memory
PROXIMO:
But
I,
on
the
other
hand...
I'm
an
entertainer.
Guard!
He
killed
the
man
who
set
you
free.

Praetorians,
master.
SOLDIER:
Halt!



COMMODUS:
Where
have
you
been?
COMMODUS:
I
sent
for
you.
Please,
brother.
What's
troubling
you?
Does
Gracchus
have
a
new
lover?
LUCILLA:
I
don't
know.
I
thought
you'd
seen
him.
COMMODUS:
He
infects
everyone
For
the
health
of
Rome,
And
he
will
bleed,
too.
Very
soon.
But
not
tonight.
COMMODUS:
Do
you
remember
"It's
a
dream...
"a
frightful
dream...
"life
is."
Do
you
think
that's
true?
I
don't
know.

I
think
it
is.
And
I
have
only
you
to
share
it
with.
Open
your
mouth.

You
know
I
love
you.
And
I
love
you.

SOLDIER:
Out.
Get
out!
Move!
Congratulations,
General.
You've
got
very
persuasive
friends.
My
brother
has
had
Gracchus
arrested.
LUCILLA:
We
daren't
wait
any
longer.
Proximo
will
come
at
midnight
Your
servant,
Cicero,
will
be
waiting
there
MAXIMUS:
You
have
done
all
this?
You
risk
too
much.
I
have
much
to
pay
for.
MAXIMUS:
You
have
nothing
to
pay
for.
You
love
your
son.
You're
strong
for
him.
I
am
tired
of
being
strong.
My
brother
hates
all
the
world,
MAXIMUS:
Because
your
father
chose
me.
Because
my
father
loved
you.
And
because
I
loved
you.
A
long
time
ago.
Was
I
very
different
then?
MAXIMUS:
You
laughed
more.
I
have
felt
alone
all
my
life...
except
with
you.
LUCILLA:
I
must
go.
Yes.

LUCIUS:
There.
And
I
got
you.
COMMODUS:
Isn't
it
late
I'm
not
a
legionnaire.
-
Not
a
legionnaire?
A
gladiator?
Gladiators
only
fight
in
the
games.
Wouldn't
you
rather
be
I'm
Maximus,
the
savior
of
Rome!
The
savior
of
Rome?

And
who
said
that?
Where's
Lucius?
He's
with
the
Emperor,
my
lady.
LUCIUS:
She
couldn't.
She
took
it
from
a
basket...
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast,
LUCIUS:
It
bit
her
in
the
breast?
You
see,
Lucius,
sometimes
royal
ladies...
behave
very
strangely
LUCIUS:
I
think
it's
silly.
Sister,
join
us.
COMMODUS:
I've
been
reading
LUCIUS:
I've
been
reading,
too.
He's
a
very
clever
little
boy.
We've
been
reading
about
the
great
And
the
queen
killed
herself
with
a
snake.
COMMODUS:
And
just
wait
until
you
hear
If
you're
very
good,
tomorrow
night
He
was
betrayed...
by
those
closest
to
him.

By
his
own
blood.
They
whispered
in
dark
corners...
and
went
out
late
at
night...
and
conspired,
and
conspired.
But
the
Emperor
Claudius
knew
He
knew
they
were
busy
little
bees.
And
one
night
he
sat
down
and
he
looked
at
her...
and
he
said:
"Tell
me
what
you've
been
doing...
"busy
little
bee.
"Or
I
shall
strike
down
those
dearest
to
you.
"You
shall
watch
as
I
bathe
in
their
blood."
And
the
Emperor
was
heartbroken.
The
little
bee
had
wounded
him
more
deeply
What
do
you
think
happened
then,
Lucius?
I
don't
know,
Uncle.
The
little
bee
told
him
everything.



SOLDIER:
Open,
Proximo!
Open
the
gates,
Open
the
gates!
Open
the
gates,
Proximo.
Do
you
want
to
die,
old
man?
Here.
PROXIMO:
Everything
is
prepared.
It
seems
you
have
won
your
freedom.
Proximo,
are
you
in
danger
-
Juba.
Open
the
gates!

SOLDIER:
Pull!
SOLDIER:
Move!
I
only
need
moments,
If
you
don't
want
any
part
of
this,
We'll
wait
here
for
you,
Maximus.
ALL:
Strength
and
honor.
Strength
and
honor.
SOLDIER:
Aim.
Arch
your
bows!


Shadows
and
dust.
Maximus!
I'm
sorry.

FALCO:
It's
done.
COMMODUS:
And
what
of
my
nephew?
And
what
of
his
mother?
Should
they
share
her
lover's
fate?
Or
should
I
be
merciful?
Commodus
the
Merciful.
Lucius
will
stay
with
me
now.
And
if
his
mother...
so
much
as
looks
at
me...
in
a
manner
that
displeases
me...
he
will
die.

If
she
decides
to
be
noble...
and
takes
her
own
life...
he
will
die.

COMMODUS:
And
as
for
you...
you
will
love
me...
as
I
have
loved
you.
COMMODUS:
You
will
provide
me
so
that
Commodus...
and
his
progeny
will
rule
for
1,000
years.
Am
I
not
merciful?
Am
I
not
merciful!

CROWD:
Maximus!

I'm
a
soldier.
I
obey.
Nothing
happens
to
anyone
Maximus!
COMMODUS:
They
call
for
you.
COMMODUS:
The
general
The
slave
who
became
a
gladiator.
The
gladiator
who
defied
an
emperor.
A
striking
story.
COMMODUS:
Now
the
people
want
to
know
Only
a
famous
death
will
do.
And
what
could
be
more
glorious...
than
to
challenge
the
Emperor
himself
MAXIMUS:
You
would
fight
me?
Do
you
think
I'm
afraid?
I
think
you
have
been
afraid
all
your
life.
Unlike
Maximus
the
Invincible,

I
knew
a
man
who
once
said,
"All
a
man
can
do
is
smile
back."
I
wonder...
did
your
friend
smile
at
his
own
death?
You
must
know.

He
was
your
father.
You
loved
my
father,
I
know...
but
so
did
I.
That
makes
us
brothers,
doesn't
it?
Smile
for
me
now,
brother.
Strap
on
his
armor.
Conceal
the
wound.




SOLDIER:
Ring
formation!








Quintus,
sword.
Give
me
your
sword.
Sword!
Give
me
a
sword!
Sheathe
your
swords.




QUINTUS:
Maximus.
Quintus.
Free
my
men.
MAXIMUS:
Senator
Gracchus
There
was
a
dream
that
was
Rome.
It
shall
be
realized.
These
are
the
wishes
of
Marcus
Aurelius.
QUINTUS:
Free
the
prisoners.
Go!

Maximus.
Lucius
is
safe.
Go
to
them.


You're
home.


Is
Rome
worth
one
good
man's
life?
We
believed
it
once.
Make
us
believe
it
again.
He
was
a
soldier
of
Rome.
Honor
him.
Who
will
help
me
carry
him?


JUBA:
Now
we
are
free.
I
will
see
you
again.

But
not
yet.
Not
yet.
