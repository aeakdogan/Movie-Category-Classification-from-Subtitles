What

it?

FEDORA:
-
Nothing.
The
kid's
got
something!

I
got
something,
Garth!
I
got
something
right
here.

Oh,
look
at
that!

We're

HALF
BREED:
Hey,
we
got
to
find
It's
the
Cross
of
Coronado.
Cortez
gave
it
to
him
in
1520.
MAN:
Oh,
boy!
ROSCOE:
I'm
thinkin'
about
and
put
it
on
her
bony
finger!
That
cross
is
an
important
artifact.
Run
back
and
find
the
others.
Tell
Mr.
Havelock
-
Have
him
bring
the
sheriff.
It's
only
a
snake.
Did
you
hear
what
I
said?
Right.
Run
back...
Mr.
Havelock...
The
sheriff...
What,
what
are
you
gonna
do?
I
don't
know.
I'll
think
of
something.
FEDORA:
Dig
with
your
hands,
He's
got
our
thing!
-
Get
him!
Mr.
Havelock!
Anybody!
Everybody's
lost
but
me.
There
he
is!
Let's
go!
Let's
go!

-
Hey!
Hey,
you!
Hey!
Come
back
here!

Come
on!
Get
him!
Hey,
come
back
here!





Here,
let
me.

Holy
smokes!
Come
on,
kid.
There's
no
way
out
of
this.
-

Toss
up
the
whip.
You
got
heart,
kid,
It
belongs
to
Coronado.
Coronado
is
dead,
This
should
be
in
a
museum.
Now
give
it
back!

A
snake!
Snake!
FEDORA:
Don't
let
him
get
away!
INDY:
Magic?
Hold
it.
Make
sure
he
doesn't
double
back.
Okay,
kid,
out
of
the
box,
now.
Son
of
a...
Damn.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad.
-
Dad...
-
It's
important.
-
No,
Dad.
You
listen
to
me.
One,
two,
three,
four...
HENRY:
In
Greek.


HENRY:
"May
he
who
illuminated
this,
I
brought
the
sheriff.
Just
the
man
I
want
to
see.
Now,
there
were
five
or
six
of
them...
-
It's
all
right,
son.
-
You
still
got
it?
It's
right
here.
I'm
glad
to
see
that
because
the
rightful
owner
of
this
cross
He's
got
witnesses,
five
or
six
of
them.

Yeah!
Good
day.
You
lost
today,
kid,
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
like
it.
Small
world,
Dr.
Jones.
Too
small
for
two
of
us.
This
is
the
second
time
my
property
from
you.
That
belongs
in
a
museum.
So
do
you.
Throw
him
over
the
side.

Grab
him,
he's
getting
away!
Stop
him!

Shush!
Shush!
Dr.
Jones,
I
am
so
glad
you're

Your

is

Dr.

you

This
is

Okay.

MAN:
Dr.
Jones?
Dr.
Jones.
I
trust
your
trip
down
My
men
didn't
alarm
you,
I
hope.
My
name
is
Donovan.
Walter
Donovan.
I
know
who
you
are,
Mr.
Donovan.
Your
contributions
to
the
museum
have
been
extremely
generous.
Some
of
the
pieces
in
your
collection
Well,
like
yourself,
Dr.
Jones,
Have
a
look
over
here.
This
might
interest
you.
INDY:
Well,
it's
sandstone.
Early
Latin
text.
Mid-12th
century,
I
should
think.
That
was
our
assessment,
as
well.
Where
did
this
come
from?
My
engineers
unearthed
it
while
excavating
for
copper.
Can
you
translate
the
inscription?

"...who
drinks
the
water
"will
have
a
spring
inside
him
"welling
up
for
eternal

"Let
them
bring
me

I've
heard
this
bedtime
story
before.
Eternal

Dr.
Jones!
The
gift
of
youth
Now,
that's
a
bedtime
story
An
old
man's
dream.
Every
man's
dream,
Grail
lore
is
his
hobby.
He's
a
teacher
of
medieval
literature.
The
one
the
students
hope
Walter,
you're
neglecting
your
guests.
DONOVAN:
Be
along
in
a
moment,
dear.
Hard
to
resist,
isn't
it?
The
Holy
Grail's
final
resting
place
What
good
is
it?
This
Grail
tablet
speaks
of
deserts
It's
pretty
vague.
Where
do
you
want
to
start
looking?
Maybe
if
the
tablet
were
intact,
but
the
entire
top
portion
is
missing.
Just
the
same,
an
attempt
to
recover
Let
me
tell
you
another
After
the
Grail
was
entrusted
it
disappeared,
before
it
was
found
again
Three
brothers,
to
be
exact.
I've
heard
this
one,
as
well.
Two
of
these
brothers
150
years
after
having
found
the
Grail
and
began
the
long
journey
but
only
one
of
them
made
it.
And
before
dying
of
extreme
old
age,
he
supposedly
imparted
his
tale
to
a...
Not
"supposedly,"
Dr.
Jones.
This
is
the
manuscript
in
which
It
doesn't
reveal
the
location
of
but
the
knight
promised
that
had
been
left
behind
would.
This
tablet
is
one
of
those
markers.
It
proves
the
knight's
story
is
true.
But
as
you
pointed
out,
it's
incomplete.
Now,
the
second
marker
is
entombed
Our
project
leader
within
the
city
of
Venice,
Italy.
As
you
can
now
see,
Dr.
Jones,
we're
about
to
complete
a
great
quest
that
began
almost
2,000
years
ago.
We're
only
one
step
away.
That's
usually
when
the
ground
falls
out
You
could
be
more
right
than
you
know.
Yes?
We've
hit
a
snag.
Our
project
leader
has
vanished,
We
received
a
cable
from
his
colleague,
who
has
no
idea
of
his
whereabouts
I
want
you
to
pick
up
the
trail
Find
the
man,
You've
got
the
wrong
Jones,
Why
don't
you
try
my
father?
We
already
have.
Your
father
is
the
man
BRODY:
Your
father
and
I
have
been
I've
watched
you
grow
up,
Indy.
I've
watched
the
two
of
you
grow
apart.
I've
never
seen
you
this
concerned
Dad?
He's
an
academic,
a
bookworm.
Dad?
Dad?
Dear
God.
BRODY:
What
has
the
old
fool
I
don't
know,
but
whatever
it
is,
Dad?
It's
today's
mail,
and
it's
been
opened.
Mail.
That's
it,
Marcus.
Venice,
Italy.
BRODY:
What
is
it?
INDY:
It's
Dad's
Grail
diary.
Every
clue
he
followed.
A
complete
record
of
his
search
This
is
his
whole
life.
Why
would
he
have
sent
this
to
me?
I
don't
know,
but
someone
must
want
it
pretty
badly.
Do
you
believe,
Marcus?
Do
you
believe
the
Grail
actually
exists?
The
search
for
the
Cup
of
Christ
But
if
you
want
facts,
Indy,
At
my
age,
I'm
prepared
to
Call
Donovan,
Marcus.
Tell
him
I'll
take
that
ticket
I'll
tell
him
we'll
take
two.
All
right,
tell
me
what's
going
to
happen
Don't
worry,
Dr.
Schneider
-
Schneider?
It's
at
your
disposal.
Oh,
well,
that's
good.
Thank
you.
Dr.
Jones,
good
luck.
Now
be
very
careful.
Signora?
Signorina?
-
Ah,
Venice...
How
will
we
recognize
I
don't
know.
Maybe
he'll
know
us.
WOMAN:
Dr.
Jones?
INDY:
Yes?
I
knew
it
was
you.
You
have
your
father's
eyes.
And
my
mother's
ears,
Looks
like
the
best
parts
-
Marcus
Brody?
Dr.
Elsa
Schneider.
How
do
you
do?
ELSA:
The
last
time
I
saw
your
father,
He
was
very
close
to
tracking
down

I've
never
seen
him
He
was
as
giddy
as
a
schoolboy.
INDY:
Who?
Attila
the
Professor?
He
was
never
giddy,
Frulein,
will
you
permit
me?
-
I
usually
don't.
-
In
that
case,
I
permit
you.
But
I'm
already
sad.
Tomorrow
I'll
steal
you
another.
I
hate
to
interrupt
you,
Yes.
I
have
something
to
show
you.
I
left
your
father
working
in
the
library.
He
sent
me
to
the
map
section
When
I
got
back
to
his
table,
except
for
that
scrap,
Roman
numerals.
ELSA:
Here
is
the
library.
INDY:
That
doesn't
look
BRODY:
Looks
like
a
converted
church.
In
this
case,
it's
the
literal
truth.
We
are
on
holy
ground.
These
columns
over
here
after
the
sacking
of
Byzantium
Now,
please
excuse
me.
The
library's
closing
in
a
few
moments.
I'll
arrange
for
us
Marcus,
I've
seen
this
window
before.
Where?
Right
here,
in
Dad's
diary.
INDY:
You
see?
Look,
Indy.
The
Roman
numerals.
Dad
was
onto
something
here.
Well,
now
we
know
but
we
still
don't
know
what
they
mean.
Dad
sent
me
this
diary
for
a
reason.
Until
we
find
out
why,
Find
something?
Yes.
Three,
seven
and
ten.
That
window
seems
to
be
My
God,
I
must
be
blind.
Dad
wasn't
looking
for
a
book
he
was
looking
for
the
tomb
itself.
Don't
you
get
it?
The
tomb
is
somewhere
in
the
library.
You
said
yourself
it
used
to
be
a
church.
Look.
Three.
Three.
Seven.
Seven.
Ten.
And
ten.
Now
where's
the
ten?
Look
around
for
the
ten.
INDY:
Three
and
seven.
Seven
and
seven
and
ten.
Ten.
"X"
marks
the
spot.

Bingo.
You
don't
disappoint,
Dr.
Jones.
You're
a
great
deal
like
your
father.
Except
he's
lost,
and
I'm
not.
Lower
me
down.
Look
after
this
for
me,
will
you?
Come
on.
Pagan
symbols.
Fourth
or
fifth
century.
Right.
600
years
before
the
Crusades.
The
Christians
would
have
and
burial
chambers
centuries
later.
INDY:
That's
right.
If
there's
a
knight
of
that's
where
we'll
find
him.

What's
this
one?
The
Ark
of
the
Covenant.
-
Are
you
sure?
Watch
out.
It's
petroleum.
I
should
sink
a
well
down
here
Give
me
the
lighter.
Oh,
rats.


Come
on.
INDY:
Come
here.
Look,
it...
it
must
be
one
of
these.
ELSA:
Look
at
the
artistry
It's
this
one.
This
is
it.
We
found
it.
Look.
The
engraving
on
the
shield,
The
shield
is
the
second
marker.
What's
that?
INDY:
It's
a
rubbing
Dad
made
Just
like
your
father,
Wouldn't
it
be
wonderful
He
never
would
have
He
hates
rats.
He's
scared
to
death
of
them.


Get
back!
Back
against
the
wall.
Quick!
Under
it!
Air
pocket!
-
Don't
wander
off.
What?

I
think
I've
found
a
way
out.
Deep
breath.

Ah,
Venice.
Are
you
crazy?
Don't
go
between
them!
Go
between
them?
Are
you
crazy?
I
said
go
around!
You
said
go
between
them!
I
said,
don't
go
between
them!
No!
Why
are
you
trying
to
kill
us?
Because
you're
looking
My
father
was
looking
for
the
Holy
Grail.
KAZIM:
No.
Where
is
he?
Talk
or
you're
dead.
Damn
it,
tell
me!
Tell
me!
If
you
don't
let
go,
Dr.
Jones,
Then
we'll
die.
My
soul
is
prepared.
How's
yours?
This
is
your
last
chance.
No,
Dr.
Jones,
it's
yours.
INDY:
All
right,
where's
my
father?
KAZIM:
If
you
let
me
go,
Who
are
you?
My
name
is
Kazim.
And
why
were
you
trying
to
kill
me?
The
secret
of
the
Grail
has
been
safe
and
for
all
that
time,
the
Brotherhood
of
the
Cruciform
Sword
have
been
prepared
Let
me
off
at
this
jetty.
Ask
yourself,
why
do
you
Is
it
for
His
glory,
or
for
yours?
I
didn't
come
for
the
Cup
of
Christ.
In
that
case,
Your
father
is
being
held
on
the
Austrian-German
border.
INDY:
How's
the
head?
BRODY:
It's
better,
now
I've
seen
this.
It's
the
name
of
a
city.
"Alexandretta"?
The
knights
of
the
First
Crusade
laid
siege
to
the
city
The
entire
city
was
destroyed.
The
present
city
of
Iskenderun
Marcus,
you
remember
"Across
the
desert
"to
the
Canyon
of
the
Crescent
Moon."
But
where
exactly?
Your
father
would
know.
Your
father
did
know.
He
must
have
pieced
it
together
the
whole
history
of
the
Grail
quest.
A
map
with
no
names.
Now,
he
knew
there
was
a
city
He
knew
the
course
turned
south
and
the
river
led
Straight
to
the
canyon.
He
knew
everything
the
name
of
the
city.
Alexandretta.
-
Now
we
know.
Marcus,
get
hold
of
Sallah.
What
about
you?
I'm
going
after
Dad.
Elsa?

Elsa?
Elsa?

-
My
room...
What
were
they
looking
for?
This.
-
The
Grail
diary?
You
had
it?
You
didn't
trust
me.
I
didn't
know
you.
At
least
I
let
you
tag
along.
Oh,
yes.
Give
them
a
flower,
Knock
it
off.
You're
not
mad.
No?
No.
You
like
the
way
I
do
things.
It's
lucky
I
don't
do
things
the
same
way.
You'd
still
be
standing
Look,
what
do
you
think
Since
I
met
you,
drowned,
shot
at,
We're
caught
in
the
middle
My
guess
is
Dad
found
out
And
until
I'm
sure,
the
way
I
think
they
should
be
done.
How
dare
you
kiss
me!
Leave
me
alone.
I
don't
like
fast
women.
And
I
hate
arrogant
men.

Ah,
Venice.

What
do
you
know
about
this
place?
I
know
the
Brunwalds
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Don't
know.
I'll
think
of
something.

Yes?

Did
you
intend
to
leave
us
We're
drenched!

Now
look,
I've
gone
and
caught
a
sniffle.
Are
you
expected?
Do
not
take
that
tone
with
me,
Now
buttle
off
and
tell
Baron
Brunwald
that
Lord
Clarence
MacDonald
are
here
to
view
the
tapestries.
Tapestries?
Dear
me,
the
man
is
dense.
This
is
a
castle,
isn't
it?
This
is
a
castle,
and
we
have
many
tapestries.
But
if
you
are
a
Scottish
lord,
How
dare
he?


Nazis.
I
hate
these
guys.

This
one.
I
think
he's
in
here.
How
do
you
know?
Because
it's
wired.
Indy?
Indy?
Don't
worry.
This
is
kid's
play.
I'll
be
right
back.
Junior?
Yes,
sir.
It
is
you,
Junior!
Don't
call
me
that,
please.
Well,
what
are
you
doing
here?
I
came
to
get
you.
What
do
you
thi...

Late
14th
century,
Ming
dynasty.
It
breaks
the
heart.
And
the
head.
You
hit
me,
Dad.
I'll
never
forgive
myself.
Don't
worry,
I'm
fine.
Thank
God.
It's
fake.
See,
you
can
tell
by
the
cross
section.
No!
Dad,
get
your
stuff.
HENRY:
Well,
I'm
sorry
but
I
thought
you
were
one
of
them.
Dad,
they
come
in
through
the
doors.
Good
point.
But
better
safe
than
sorry.
So
I
was
wrong
this
time.
But,
by
God,
I
wasn't
wrong
You
obviously
got
it.
I
got
it,
and
I
used
it.
We
found
the
entrance
Through
the
library?
Right.
I
knew
it.
And
the
tomb
of
Sir
Richard?
Found
it.
He
was
actually
there?
You
saw
him?
Well,
what
was
left
of
him.
And
his
shield,
the
inscription
on
Sir
Richard's
shield?
"Alexandretta."

Alexandretta!
Of
course!
On
the
pilgrim
trail
Junior,
you
did
it.
No,
Dad.
You
did.
Forty
years.
If
only
I
could
have
been
with
you.
There
were
rats,
Dad.
Rats?
Yeah,
big
ones.
What
do
the
Nazis
want
with
you,
Dad?
-
They
wanted
my
diary.
I
knew
I
had
to
get
that
book
Yeah.
Dr.
Jones.
BOTH:
Yes?
I
will
take
the
book
now.
BOTH:
What
book?
You
have
the
diary
in
your
pocket.

You
dolt!
Do
you
think
my
son
that
he
would
bring
my
diary
You
didn't,
did
you?
-
You
didn't
bring
it,
did
you?
You
did.
Look,
can
we
discuss
this
later?
I
should
have
mailed
it
Will
you
take
it
easy?
Take
it
easy?
Why
do
you
think
I
sent
it
home
So
it
wouldn't
fall
into
their
hands!
I
came
here
to
save
you!
Oh,
yeah?
And
who's
gonna
come
I
told
you...
...don't
call
me
Junior!
Look
what
you
did!
I
can't
believe
what
you
did...
Elsa?
Elsa?
That's
far
enough.
Put
down
the
gun,
or
the
Frulein
dies.
-
But
she's
one
of
them.
-
She's
a
Nazi.
-
Trust
me.
I
will
kill
her!
-
Yeah?
Go
ahead!
Don't
worry.
He
won't.
Indy,
please!
Do
what
he
says!
And
don't
listen
to
her.
-
Enough!
She
dies!
Wait!
Wait...
I'm
sorry.
No,
don't
be.
But
you
should
have
She
ransacked
her
own
room,
How
did
you
know
she
was
a
Nazi?
How
did
you
know
she
was
a
Nazi?
She
talks
in
her
sleep.
I
didn't
trust
her.
Why
did
you?
MAN:
Because
he
didn't
take
my
advice.
Donovan.
Didn't
I
warn
you
not
to
trust
anybody,
I
misjudged
you,
Walter.
I
knew
you
would
sell
your
mother
but
I
didn't
know
you
would
to
the
slime
of
humanity.
Dr.
Schneider,
there
are
pages
torn
out
of
this.
This
book
contained
a
map,
precise
directions
from
the
unknown
city
to
the
secret
So
it
did.
Where
are
these
missing
pages,
We
must
have
these
pages
back.
You're
wasting
your
breath.
He
won't
tell
us,
and
he
doesn't
have
to.
It's
perfectly
obvious
He's
given
them
to
Marcus
Brody.
HENRY:
Marcus?
You
didn't
drag
poor
Marcus
along,
He's
not
up
to
the
challenge.
He
sticks
out
like
a
sore
thumb.
We'll
find
him.
The
hell
you
will.
He's
got
a
two-day
head
start
on
you,
which
is
more
than
he
needs.
Brody's
got
friends
from
here
to
the
Sudan.
He
speaks
a
dozen
languages,
He'll
blend
in,
disappear.
You'll
never
see
him
again.
With
any
luck,
Does
anyone
here
speak
English?
Or
even
ancient
Greek?
Water?
No,
thank
you,
sir.
No.
Fish
make
love
in
it.
Goodness
me.
Thank
you
so
much.
No,
I
really
don't
want...
No,
no,
thank
you
very
much.
No,
thank
you,
madam.
I'm
a
vegetarian.
Does
anyone
understand
Mr.
Brody!
Sallah.
What
a
relief.
Marcus
Brody,
sir.
-
But
where
is
Indy?
A
slight
detour.
You
are
on
your
own?
Yes,
but
don't
panic.
Have
you,
have
you
Yes,
of
course.
This
map
will
show
you.
It
was
drawn
by...
Mr.
Brody.
Welcome
to
Iskenderun.
The
director
has
sent
a
car
for
you.
Well,
your
servant,
sir.
And
I
am
his.
Follow
me,
please.
My
reputation
precedes
me.
There
is
no
museum
in
Iskenderun.
Papers,
please.
Papers?
Of
course.
-
Run.
Papers.
Got
it
here.
Just
finished
reading
it
myself.
-
Run.
Egyptian
Mail,
morning
edition.
Run.
Did
you
say...
Run!
Okay,
okay,
quick,
quick,
quick!
Find
the
back
door!
Find
the
back
door!
Intolerable.
Dr.
Schneider.
Message
from
Berlin.
You
must
return
immediately.
-
A
rally
at
the
Institute
Your
presence
on
the
platform
Thank
you,
Herr
Oberst.
Take
this
diary
It
will
show
them
our
progress,
Without
the
map,
Let
me
kill
them
now.
No.
If
we
fail
to
recover
we'll
need
them
alive.
Always
do
what
the
doctor
orders.
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.
We
both
wanted
the
Grail.
I
would
have
done
anything
to
get
it.
You
would
have
done
the
same.
I'm
sorry
you
think
so.
I
can't
forget
how
wonderful
it
was.
Thank
you.
It
was
rather
wonderful.
VOGEL:
Dr.
Schneider.
Your
car
is
waiting.
That's
how
Austrians
say
good-bye.
And
this
is
how
we
say
good-bye

I
liked
the
Austrian
way
better.
So
did
I.
Let's
try
and
get
these
ropes
loose.
We've
got
to
get
to
Marcus
You
said
he
had
two
days'
start.
Are
you
kidding?
I
made
that
up.
You
know
Marcus.
Can
you
try
and
reach
HENRY:
What
am
I
looking
for?
My
lucky
charm.
Feels
like
a
cigarette
lighter.
INDY:
Try
and
burn
through
the
ropes.
Very
good.

I
ought
to
tell
you
something.
Don't
get
sentimental
now,
Dad.
The
floor's
on
fire.
-
See?
And
the
chair.
Move!
Move
it
out
of
here!
Go!
HENRY:
It's
scorching
the
table!
Fast!
-
Move!

Well,
we
have
Marcus
Brody,
but
more
important,
we
have
the
map.

"By
the
personal
command
"Secrecy
essential
to
success.
"Eliminate
the
American
conspirators."
Germany
has
declared
war

-
Dad!
-
Dad!
-
Dad!
Head
for
the
fireplace!

INDY:
I
think
I
can
get
these
ropes
off.

Whoops!

Our
situation
has
not
improved.
Listen,
Dad,
I'm
almost
free.

Alarm!

This
is
intolerable.
I'm
out,
Dad.
Well
done,
boy.


Come
on,
Dad.
Dead
end.
There's
got
to
be
a...
A
secret
door
or
a...
Passageway
or
something.
I
find
that
if
I
just
sit
down
and
think...

Dad!
...the
solution
presents
itself.
Great.
More
boats.
You
say
this
has
been

No!
But
better
than
most.
Come
on,
Dad.
Come
on.
What
about
the
boat?
We're
not
going
on
the
boat?
Jones!


Halt!
Halt!

-
HENRY:
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
You're
going
the
wrong
way.
Brody's
this
way.
My
diary's
in
Berlin.
We
don't
need
the
diary,
Dad.
Marcus
has
the
map.
There
is
more
in
the
diary
All
right,
Dad.
Tell
me.
Well,
he
who
finds
the
Grail
What
final
challenge?
Three
devices
of
such
lethal
cunning.
-
Booby
traps?
But
I
found
the
clues
that
in
the
Chronicles
of
St.
Anselm.
Well,
what
are
they?
Can't
you
remember?
I
wrote
them
down
in
my
diary
Half
the
German
army's
on
our
tail,
-
Into
the
lion's
den?
The
only
thing
that
matters
is
the
Grail.
What
about
Marcus?
Marcus
would
agree
with
me.
Two
selfless
martyrs.
Jesus
Christ.

That's
for
blasphemy.
The
quest
for
the
Grail
It's
a
race
against
evil.
If
it
is
captured
by
the
Nazis,
the
armies
of
darkness
Do
you
understand
me?
This
is
an
obsession,
Dad.
I
never
understood
it.
Never.
Neither
did
Mom.
Oh,
yes,
she
did.
Only
too
well.
Unfortunately,
she
kept
until
all
I
could
do
was
mourn
her.



My
boy,
we
are
pilgrims

Frulein
Doctor.
-
Where
is
it?
Where
is
it?
I
want
it.
You
came
back
for
the
book?
Why?
My
father
didn't
want
it
incinerated.
Is
that
what
you
think
of
me?
I
believe
in
the
Grail,
not
the
swastika.
But
you
stood
up
to
be
counted
with
the
enemy
of
everything
Who
gives
a
damn
what
you
think?
You
do.
All
I
have
to
do
is
squeeze.
All
I
have
to
do
is
scream.
I've
got
it.

-
What
did
you
get?
First
available
flight
out
of
Germany.
Good.
Well,
we
made
it.
When
we're
airborne,
then
I'll
share
that
sentiment.
Relax.


Tickets,
please.

Guten
Tag,
Herr
Jones.

Tickets,
please.

WOMAN:
We
should
get
out
of
here.
No
ticket.
Ticket.
MAN
1:
Ticket!
-
Ticket!

You
know,
sharing
your
adventures
is
That's
not
all
we
shared.
It's
disgraceful.
Her
grandfather.
Well,
I'm
as
human
as
the
next
man.
I
was
the
next
man.

Of
course.
Well...
Ships
that
pass
in
the
night.
Do
you
remember
the
last
time
I
had
a
milkshake.
What
did
we
talk
about?
We
didn't
talk.
We
never
talked.
Do
I
detect
a
rebuke?
A
regret.
It
was
just
the
two
of
us,
Dad.
It
was
a
lonely
way
to
grow
up.
If
you'd
been
an
ordinary,
like
the
other
guys'
dads,
Actually,
I
was
a
wonderful
father.
When?
Did
I
ever
tell
you
to
eat
up?
Go
to
bed?
Wash
your
ears?
Do
your
homework?
No.
I
respected
your
privacy,
What
you
taught
me
was
than
people
who'd
been
dead
And
I
learned
it
so
well
that
we've
hardly
spoken
for
20
years.
You
left
just
when
Unbelievable.
-
Dad,
how
can
you...
I'm
here
now.
What
do
you
want
to
talk
about?
Well,
I...


I
can't
think
of
anything.
Then
what
are
you
complaining
about?
Look,
we
have
work
to
do.
When
we
get
to
Alexandretta,
The
first,
"The
Breath
of
God.
Second,
"The
Word
of
God.
"Only
in
the
footsteps
of
God
Third,
"The
Path
of
God.
"Only
in
the
leap
from
the
lion's
head
What
does
that
mean?
I
don't
know.
We'll
find
out.
We're
turning
around.
They're
taking
us
back
to
Germany.
INDY:
Well,
I
thought
it
would
to
figure
out
the
radio
was
dead.
Come
on,
Dad.
Move!
Come
on,
Dad.
Come
on!
I
didn't
know
you
could
fly
a
plane.
Fly,
yes.
Land,
no.

Dad,
you're
going
to
have
to
Get
it
ready.
Eleven
o'clock!
Dad,
eleven
o'clock!
What
happens
at
eleven
o'clock?
Twelve,
eleven,
ten.
Eleven
o'clock,
fire!
Dad,
are
we
hit?
More
or
less.
Son,
I'm
sorry.
They
got
us.
Hang
on,
Dad.
We're
going
in!
-
Nice
landing.
Those
people
are
trying
to
kill
us!
I
know,
Dad!
Well.
It's
a
new
experience
for
me.
It
happens
to
me
all
the
time.
This
is
intolerable!
This
could
be
close.
Faster,
boy!
Faster!
Well,
they
don't
come
Dad,
he's
coming
back!


I
suddenly
"Let
my
armies
be
"and
the
birds
in
the
sky."
DONOVAN:
These
pages
are
taken
from
and
they
include
a
map
that
pinpoints
As
you
can
see,
However,
Your
Highness,
we
would
not
think
of
crossing
your
soil
nor
of
removing
the
Grail
without
suitable
compensation.
What
have
you
brought?

Precious
valuables,
Your
Highness,
donated
by
some
of
the
finest
families
Rolls-Royce
Phantom
Two.
Four-point-three
liter,
30
horsepower,
with
Stromberg
downdraft
carburetor.
Can
go
from
zero
to
in
12.5
seconds.
And
I
even
like
the
color.
The
keys
are
in
the
ignition,
You
shall
have
camels,
horses,
an
armed
escort,
provisions,
desert
vehicles
and
tanks.
You're
welcome.
We
have
no
time
to
lose.
Indiana
Jones
We
go
this
way.
Get
that
camel
out
of
the
way.
What
happened
to
Marcus,
Sallah?
They
set
out
across
the
desert
I
believe
they
took
Mr.
Brody
with
them.
Now
they
have
the
map.
And
in
this
sort
of
race,
there's
no
silver
medal
Care
to
wet
your
whistle,
Marcus?
I'd
rather
spit
in
your
face.
But
as
I
haven't
got
any
spit...
Must
be
within
three
or
four
miles.
Otherwise
we
are
off
the
map.
Well,
Marcus,
the
greatest
artifact
You're
meddling
with
powers

INDY:
I
see
Brody.
He
seems
okay.
They've
got
a
tank.
Six-pound
gun.
What
do
you
think
you're
doing
there?
Dad,
we're
well
out
of
range.

That
car
belonged
to
my
brother-in-law.
Come
on,
come
on!
I
can't
see
anyone
up
there.
Maybe
it
wasn't
even
Jones.
No,
it
is
him,
all
right.
He's
here
somewhere.
Put
Brody
in
the
tank.
Well,
in
this
sun,
without
transportation,

It's
Jones,
all
right.
-
Now,
who
are
all
these
people?
As
long
as
Dad,
you
stay
here
while
Sallah
and
I

-
I'm
going
after
those
horses.
-
I
don't
need
camels.
No
camels.
Who
is
he?
A
messenger
from
God.
For
the
unrighteous,
the
Cup
of
Life
-
Marcus!
"Genius
of
the
Restoration..."
"Aid
our
own
resuscitation."
Henry,
what
are
you
doing
here?
It's
a
rescue,
old
boy.
Come
on.
Search
him.
What
is
in
this
book?
That
miserable
little
diary
of
yours.
We
have
the
map.
The
book
is
useless.
And
yet
you
come
all
the
way
back
Why?
What
are
you
hiding?
What
does
the
diary
tell
you
It
tells
me
that
goose-stepping
morons
should
try
reading
books
DONOVAN:
Colonel!
Jones
is
getting
away.
I
think
not,
Herr
Donovan.
Not
that
Jones,
the
other
Jones!
Sallah,
I
said
no
camels!
That's
five
camels.
Can't
you
count?
Compensation
for
Indy,
your
father
and
Brody...
Where's
my
father?
They
have
them.
In
the
belly
of
that
steel
beast.

Fire!


Dad!
Dad!
-
Dad!
Junior?
Junior!


Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Get
out!



Henry,
the
pen...
-
What?
The
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword.
Look
what
you
did.
It's
war.
Didn't
I
tell
you
it
was
a
rescue?

-
Dad!
You
call
this
archeology?
Get
out
of
there,
Dad.
How
does
one
get
off
this
thing?
Where's
Marcus?

Dad!
Hang
on,
Dad!
Father
of
Indy,
give
me
your
hand!
Sallah!
Get
Dad!
SALLAH:
Give
me
your
hand!
Junior!

Indy!
Oh,
God.
I've
lost
him.
And
I
never
told
him
anything.
I
just
wasn't
ready,
Marcus.
Five
minutes
would
have
been
enough.
I
thought
I'd
lost
you,
boy!
I
thought
you
had
too,
sir.
Well...
Well
done.
Come
on.
Let's
go,
then.
Why
are
you
sitting
there
resting
Come
on,
let's
go!
The
Canyon
of
the
Crescent
Moon.


DONOVAN:
Helmut,
another
volunteer!


I
never
expected
to
see
you
again.
I'm
like
a
bad
penny,
I
always
turn
up.
Step
back
now,
Dr.
Schneider.
He's
going
to
recover
the
Grail
for
us.

Impossible?
What
do
you
say,
Jones?
As
what?
A
Nazi
stooge
like
you?
The
Nazis?
Is
that
the
limit
of
your
vision?
The
Nazis
want
to
write
themselves
take
on
the
world.
Well,
they're
welcome.
But
I
want
the
Grail
itself.
The
cup
that
gives
everlasting
life.
Hitler
can
have
the
world,
I'm
going
to
be
drinking
my
own
health
The
Grail
is
mine,
and
you're
going
to
get
it
for
me.
Shooting
me
won't
get
you
anywhere.
You
know
something,
Dr.
Jones?
You're
absolutely
right.

Dad?
Dad?
Junior...
-
No!
You
can't
save
him
when
you're
dead!
The
healing
power
of
the
Grail
is
the
only
thing
It's
time
to
ask
yourself
INDY:
"The
Breath
of
God.
"Only
the
penitent
man
will
pass."
"The
penitent
man
will
pass."
The
penitent
man
will
pass.
The
penitent
man...
"Only
the
penitent
man
will
pass."
"Only
the
penitent
man
will
pass."
The
penitent
man
will
pass.
The
penitent
man...
The
penitent
man...
The
penitent...
The
penitent
man
is
humble
before
God.
Penitent.
Penitent...
The
penitent
man...
Penitent
man
is
humble,
kneels
before
God.
Kneel!
I'm
through!
We're
through.
He's
all
right.
No.
The
second
challenge:
"Only
in
the
footsteps
of
God
The
Word
of
God...
The
Word
of...
Proceed
in
the
footsteps
of
the
Word.
-
"The
Word
of
God..."
The
name
of
God...
The
name
of
God...
Jehovah.
But
in
the
Latin
alphabet,
J...
Oh,
dear.
Idiot!
In
Latin,
Jehovah
starts
with
an
"I."
"I."
"E."
"H."
"O."
"V."
"A."
"The
Path
of
God."
"Only
in
the
leap
from
the
lion's
head
"will
he
prove
his
worth."
Impossible,
nobody
can
jump
this.

BRODY:
Indy!
Indy,
you
must
hurry!
Come
quickly!
It's
a
leap
of
faith.
Oh,
geez...
You
must
believe,
boy.
You
must
believe.

I
knew
you'd
come,
but
my
strength
has
left
me.
Who
are
you?
The
last
of
three
brothers
who
swore
an
oath
to
find
the
Grail
and
to
guard
it.
That
was
700
years
ago.
A
long
time
to
wait.
You're
strangely
dressed,
for
a
knight.
I'm
not
exactly...
A
knight?
What
do
you
mean?
I
was
chosen
because
I
was
the
bravest,
The
honor
was
mine
until
another
came
to
challenge
me
to
single
combat.
I
pass
it
to
you
who
vanquished
me.
Listen,
I
don't
have
Which
one
is
it?
You
must
choose,
but
choose
wisely.
For
as
the
true
Grail
will
bring
you
life,
the
false
Grail
will
take
it
from
you.
DONOVAN:
I'm
not
a
historian.
I
have
no
idea
what
it
looks
like.
Which
one
is
it?
Let
me
choose.
Thank
you,
Doctor.
Oh,
yes.
It's
more
beautiful
This
certainly
is
the
cup
of
Eternal
life.

What
is
happening
to
me?

DONOVAN:
Tell
me,
what
is
happening?

He
chose
poorly.
ELSA:
It
would
not
be
made
out
of
gold.
That's
the
cup
of
a
carpenter.
There's
only
one
way
to
find
out.
You
have
chosen
wisely.
But
the
Grail
cannot
pass
That
is
the
boundary


(MAN
SPEAKING
Drop
your
guns.
Please.
Dad,
come
on,
get
to
your
feet.
We
have
got
it.
Come
on!
Elsa!
Elsa,
don't
move!
It's
ours,
Indy,
yours
and
mine.
INDY:
Elsa,
don't
cross
the
Seal.
The
knight
warned
us

HENRY:
Junior!
Junior!
Elsa...
Elsa,
don't.
Elsa...
Elsa...
Give
me
your
other
hand,
honey.
I
can
reach
it.
I
can
reach
it.
Elsa,
give
me
your
hand.
Elsa!

Junior,
give
me
your
other
hand!
I
can't
hold
on.
I
can
get
it.
I
can
almost
reach
it,
Dad.
Indiana...
Indiana...
Let
it
go.
Dad...
Please,
Dad.
Elsa
never
really
believed
in
the
Grail.
She
thought
she'd
found
a
prize.
What
did
you
find,
Dad?
Me?
Illumination.
And
what
did
you
find,
Junior?
"Junior"?
Dad...
Please,
what
does
it
always
mean,
That's
his
name:
Henry
Jones,
Junior.
I
like
Indiana.
We
named
the
dog
Indiana.
May
we
go
home
now,
please?
The
dog?
You
are
named
after
the
dog?
I've
got
a
lot
of
fond
memories
-
INDY:
Ready?
Indy!
Henry!
Follow
me.
I
know
the
way!
Got
lost
in
his
own
museum,
huh?
Uh-huh.
After
you,
Junior.
Yes,
sir.
