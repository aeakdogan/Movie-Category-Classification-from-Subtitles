No.
It

A

That's
the
Flying

She

Do

And
if

I

Simple,

Hey!
Hey!

Down

Get

Get

Five

Do

Do

All

All

I

Do

I'll
take
my

sir.
To

Cruel

Life
is
cruel.
Why

I
offer
yöu
a

Join
my

One

Will

I-
I
will
serve.
There.

What

here?
Jack

What
is
yöur

here?
Jack
Sparrow
Did
he,
now?
I'm
sorely
tempted
to
accept
that

Oh.
yöu
have
a
debt
to

yöu've
been
captain
of
the
Black
Pearl
That
was
our

Technically
I

Then
yöu

as

We've

One

Have
yöu
not

He's
noble,
heroic,
Worth

Maybe
three

a

And
did
I
happen
to
mention...
he's
in

With

Due

Betrothed.

But
I
wonder,

can

Can
yöu
condemn
an

to
a
lifetime
of

in

Yep.
I'm
good
with

Shall

Three

Three

Er,

There's

And
what's

It's

Somewhere

Sorry.
Old

Easy,

Thanks,

Carry

Once
yöu've

Not

yöur

I've
sworn
no

yöu
must
get
away.
Not
until
I
find
this.
The
key.
The
dead
man's
chest.
What
do
yöu
know
of
this?
Open
the
chest
with
the
key,
No,
don't
stab
the
heart.
The
Dutchman
needs
a
living
heart
and
if
there's
no
captain,
So
the
captain
has
the
key?
-
Where
is
the
key?
-
Where
is
the
chest?

Come
to
join
me
crew,
lad?
I'm
here
to
find
the
man
I
love.
I'm
deeply
flattered,
son,
Meaning
William
Turner,
Elizabeth.
Hide
the
rum.
These
clothes
do
not
flatter
yöu.
-
I
happen
to
have
no
dress
in
my
cabin.
I
know
Will
came
to
find
yöu.
Darling,
I
am
truly
unhappy
through
unfortunate
circumstances
poor
Will
has
been
press-ganged
Davy
Jones?

Oh,
please.
The
captain
of
the
Flying
Dutchman?
-
yöu
look
awful.
What
are
yöu
doing
here?
I
can't
help
it
if
yöur
standards
are
lax.
-
yöu
smell
funny.
All
I
want
is
to
find
Will.
Are
yöu
certain?
Of
course.
Because
I
would
think
yöu'd
want
to
find
-
And
yöu'd
have
a
way
of
doing
that?
-
...there
is
a
chest.
A
chest
of
unknown
size
and
origin.
What
contains
And
whoever
possesses
that
chest
possesses
the
leverage
to
command
Jones
including
saving
brave
William
yöu
don't
actually
believe
him,
do
yöu?
How
would
we
find
it?
With
this.
My
compass...
is
unique.
"Unique"
here
True
enough,

Where
does
it
point?
It
points
to
the
thing
Oh,
Jack.
-
Are
yöu
telling
the
truth?
And
what
yöu
want
most
in
this
world
is
to
find
the
chest
of
Davy
Jones,
-
To
save
Will.
-
Mr.
Gibbs!
-
We
have
our
heading.
Cast
off
those
lines.
-
Miss
Swann.
Welcome
to
the
crew,
There's
something
to
knowing
the
exact
I
assure
yöu,
these
are
not
necessary.
I
thought
yöu'd
be
interested
-
yöu
have
news
of
her?
and
then
left
in
the
company
and
other
fugitives
from
justice.
"Justice"?
Hardly.
Including
the
previous
owner
of
this
sword,
Our
ships
are
in
pursuit.
Justice
will
and
all
manner
I
find
it
distasteful
to
even
contemplate
What
do
yöu
want
from
me?
yöur
authority
as
governor,
and
yöur
loyalty
To
yöu,
yöu
mean.
Shall
I
remove
these
shackles?
Do
what
yöu
can
for
my
daughter.

So
yöu
see,
Mercer,
every
man
Even
for
what
he
hoped
never
to
sell.
I
wager...
ten
years.
I'll
match
ten
years.
Agreed.
Wondering
how
it's
played?
-
I
understand.

It's
a
game
of
deception.
But
yöur
-
What
are
they
wagering?
Years
of
service.
-
So
any
crew
member
can
be
challenged?
I
challenge
Davy
Jones.

I
accept,
mate.
-
The
stakes?
No!
Against?
I
want
this.
-
How
do
yöu
know
of
the
key?
yöu
can
still
walk
away.
-
What's
this?
No!
Don't
do
this.
The
die
is
cast.
I
bid
three
twos.
It's
yöur
bid,
Captain.
Four
fours.
Four
fives.
Six
threes.
Seven
fives.
Eight
fives.
Welcome
to
the
crew,
lad.
Twelve
fives.
Twelve
fives.
Call
me
a
liar,
or
up
the
bid.
And
be
called
a
liar
myself
Bootstrap
Bill,
yöu're
a
liar
Master
Turner,
the
very
next
time
we
make
port!
Fool.
Why
did
yöu
do
that?
I
couldn't
let
yöu
lose.
It
was
never
about
winning
or
losing.
The
key.
yöu
just
wanted
to
know
where
it
was.

Captain
says
I'm
to
relieve
yöu.
Captain's
orders.




Here.
Take
this,
too.
Now,
get
yöurself
to
land,
and
stay
there.
It
was
always
in
my
blood
to
die
at
sea.
It
was
not
a
fate
I
ever
wanted
for
yöu.
It's
not
a
fate
yöu
had
to
choose
Aye.
I
could
say
I
did
what
I
had
to,
But
it
would
taste
a
lie
yöu
owe
me
nothing,
Will.
Now
go.
-
They'll
know
yöu
helped
me.
What
more
can
they
do
to
me?
I
take
this
with
a
promise.
I'll
find
a
way
to
sever
and
not
rest
until
this
blade
I
will
not
abandon
yöu.
I
promise.
-

Beckett?
Lord
Cutler
Beckett
Bleurgh!
Will
was
working
for
Beckett
Beckett
wants
the
compass.
Of
course.
-
He
wants
the
chest.
If
the
company
controls
the
chest,
-
A
truly
discomfiting
notion,
love.
Bad
for
every
mother's
son
I
think
there's
a
bit
more
speed
Brace
the
foreyard!
Might
I
enquire
-
Persuasion.
Decidedly
not.
Will
strikes
a
deal,
yet
yöu
were
the
one
"Commission
as
a
privateer
and
the
East
India
Trading
Company."
As
if
I
could
be
bought
-
Jack,
the
letters,
give
them
back.
Persuade
me.
yöu
do
know
Will
taught
me
As
I
said,
persuade
me.
It's
a
curious
thing.
There
was
a
time
I
would
have
wanted
yöu
-
I
don't
know
what
yöu
mean.
Oh,
don't
be
absurd.
So
yöu
never
wondered

the
Flying

Strange
thing
to
come
upon
Just
put
as
many
leagues
behind
us
And
what
are
we
running
from?
That
dress.
Where
did
yöu
get
it?
It
was
found
aboard
the
ship.
The
crew
thought
it
was
a
spirit
-
That's
foolish.
It
brought
good
fortune.
and
we
made
a
nice
bit
of
profit
there.
Off
the
books,
of
course.
I
imagine
some
of
yöur
crew
-
Why
do
yöu
ask?
-
Colors?
-
Pirates.
yöu
will
watch
this.
Aagh!
Let
no
joyful
voice
be
heard!
Let
no
man
look
up
at
the

with

Aargh!
And
let
this

be

No!
I've
doomed
us
all.
It's
the
Flying

Oh,
Mother
Carey's

Must
have
hit
a

Free
the

-
Free
the
rudder!

-
Kraken!
Here
it
is!
Take
it!
Take
it!
Aargh!
Agh!
Aaaagh!

Aagh!
Aaagh!
The
boy's
not
here.
I
am
the
sea.
yöu
need
time
alone
with
yöur
thoughts.
-
Brig!
There
are
no
survivors.

The

is
no
longer
safe.
Get
me
there
first,
"First"?
Who
sent
that
thieving
charlatan
Who
told
him
of
the
key?
Jack
Sparrow.
My
intuitive
sense
of
the
female
creature
I
just
thought
I'd
be
married
by
now.
I'm
so
ready
to
be
married.
yöu
know...

Lizzie,
I
am
captain
of
a
ship,
and
being
captain
of
a
ship,
I
could
in
fact
Right
on
this
deck.
Right...
now.
No,
thank
yöu.
Why
not?
We
are
very
much
alike,
yöu
and
I.
Oh.
Except
for
a
sense
of
honor
And
personal
hygiene.
Trifles.
yöu
will
come
over
to
my
side.
I
know
it.
-
yöu
seem
very
certain.
yöu
long
for
freedom.
yöu
long
to
do
what
yöu
want
to
do
To
act
on
selfish
impulse.
yöu
want
to
see
what
it's
like.
One
day,
yöu
won't
be
able
to
resist.
Why
doesn't
yöur
compass
work?
My
compass
works
fine.
Because
yöu
and
I
are
alike,
and
there
will
come
a
moment
-
To
do
the
right
thing.
I
like
to
wave
at
them
as
they
pass
by.
yöu'll
have
the
chance
to
do
something...
And
when
yöu
do,
That
yöu're
a
good
man.
All
evidence
to
the
contrary.
Oh,
I
have
faith
in
yöu.
-
Want
to
know
why?
Curiosity.
yöu're
going
to
want
it.
A
chance
to
be
admired
yöu
won't
be
able
to
resist.
yöu're
going
to
want
to
know
I
do
want
to
know
what
it
tastes
like.
But...
seeing
as
yöu're
a
good
man,
I
know
that
yöu'd
never
put
me
in
a
position
I'm
proud
of
yöu,
Jack.

Land,
ho!
I
want
my
jar
of
dirt.
-
yöu're
pulling
too
fast.
-
We
don't
want
the
kraken
to
catch
us.
And
I
don't
think
it's
"Kracken"
anyways.
-
With
a
long
"a"?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
"Krocken"
and
"Kracken"
is
closer
to
that.
We
ain't
Scandinavians,
are
we?
It's
a
mythological
creature.
Guard
the
boat.
Mind
the
tide.
Don't
touch
my
dirt.
This
doesn't
work.
And
it
certainly

Yes,
it
does.
-
Beg
pardon?
-
"Guard
the
boat!"
"Mind
the
tide!"
Mind
if
I
shine
yöur
shoes,
sir?
They're
here.
And
I
cannot
step
foot
yöu'll
trust
us
to
act
in
yöur
stead?
I'll
trust
yöu
to
know
-
Down,
then!


It's
real.
yöu
actually
were
telling
the
truth.
I
do
that
quite
a
lot,
With
good
reason!
Will!
yöu're
all
right!
Thank
God!

How
did
yöu
get
here?
Sea
turtles,
mate.
Not
so
easy,
is
it?
-
But
I
do
owe
yöu
thanks,
Jack.
After
yöu
tricked
me
onto
that
ship
-
What?
...I
was
reunited
with
my
father.
Oh,
well...
yöu're
welcome,
then.
Everything
yöu
said
to
me,
Pretty
much.
Time
and
tide,
love.
Oi!
What
are
yöu
doing?
I'm
going
to
kill
Jones.
Can't
let
yöu
do
that,
William.
Cos
if
Jones
is
dead,
who's
to
call
Now,
if
yöu
please.
The
key.
I
keep
the
promises
I
make,
Jack.
I
intend
to
free
my
father.
I
can't
let
yöu
do
that
either.
I
knew
yöu'd
warm
up
to
me
eventually.
Lord
Beckett
desires
I
deliver
it,
I
get
my
life
back.
Ah.
The
dark
side
of
ambition.
Oh,
I
prefer
to
see
it
Aagh!

Hyah!

-
Guard
the
chest!
This
is
barbaric!
Oh,
fine!
Let's
just
haul
out
our
swords
That
will
solve
everything!
I've
had
it!
I've
had
it
with
wobbly-legged,
-
How'd
this
go
all
screwy?
Mr.
Norrington,
I
think,
old
Jack's
looking
to
trade
it,
then
Turner,
there,
I
think
he's
trying
'twixt
him
and
his
-
Sad.
That
chest
must
be
worth
Terrible
temptation.
If
we
was
any
kind
of
decent,
Enough!
Oh.
Oh!
The
heat!
Bugger!
By
yöur
leave,
Mr.
Turner.


By

Mr.
Norrington.

Do

me
-
Be
my
guest.
Who
was
it,
that
at
the
very
moment
yöu
saw
fit
to
free
said
pirate
and
Eh?
So
whose
fault
is
it,
really,
that
yöu've
ended
up
a
rum-pot
deckhand
Enough!
Unfortunately,
Mr.
Turner,
he's
right!
Still
rooting
for
yöu,
mate.
Oh!
Oof!
Aargh!

We
got
it!
We

it!
We

it!
Hello,

Sword!
Sword!
Aargh!
Ugh!

Follow
my
voice.
To

Go

No,

Oh,

Jar
of
dirt!
Argh!
Right.

We've
got
it!
Come

Turner!
Leave
him

Unless
yöu
plan
-
We're
not
getting
out
of
this.
Into
the
boat.
-
yöu're
mad!
-
I
say
we
respect
his
final
wish.

yöur
bravery
is
wasted.
I
shall
pry
the
chest
away
-
Here
yöu
go!


Pirates!

Hey!
-
What
happened
to
the
chest?
-
yöu're
pulling
too
hard!
-
Where's
the
commodore?
My
prayers
be
with
him.
Best
not
wallow
in
our
grief.
The
bright
side
is
yöu're
back,
Lord
on
high,
deliver
us.
I'll
handle
this,
mate.
Oi,
fishface!
Lose
something?
Eh?
Scungilli!
Got
it!
Come
to
negotiate,
eh,
Look
what
I
got.

I
got
a
jar
of
dirt,

And
guess
what's
inside
it?
Enough!
-
Hard
to
starboard.
Brace
up
the
foreyard!
Hard
to
starboard!
Send
his
beloved
Pearl
She's
on
us!
She's
on
us!
-
Let
them
taste
the
triple
guns.
Aaargh!
Make
fast!
Go
on,
me
darling!
Come
on,
girl!
-
She's
falling
behind!
-
We're
the
faster?
-
But
with
the
wind...
Aye.
We're
out
of
range!
Break
off
pursuit,
We're
giving
up,
sir?
Agh!
They're
giving
up!

My
father
is
on
that
ship.
We
can
take
her.
Why
fight
when
yöu
can
negotiate?
Oh!

Where
is
it?
We
must
have
hit
a
reef!
No.
It's
not
a
reef!
-
What
is
it?
-
To
arms!
It'll
attack
the
starboard.
Run
out
Easy,
boys!
Will?
Steady!
Steady.
-
Will!
I
think
we've
held
fire
long
enough.
-
Will!
Oh!

-
It'll
be
back.
We
have
to
get
off
the
ship.
Pull
the
grates.
Get
all
the
gunpowder
-
Whatever
yöu
do,
don't
miss.
We
are
short-stocked
on
gunpowder!
Hurry
up!
-
There's
only
six
kegs
of
powder!
Aye,
the
rum
too!
Step
to!
Oh,
yöu
coward.

Not
good.
-
Haul
away!
-
Heave
like
yöu're
being
paid
for
it!

Aargh!

-
I
got
yöu!
I
got
yöu!
-
I
won't
let
yöu
go!
-
Clear?
Here!
Come
on!
Come
and
get
me.
I'm
over
here!
Come
on!
Shoot!
Elizabeth,
shoot!


Did
we
kill
it?
No.
We
just
made
it
angry.
We're
not
out
of
this
yet.
Abandon
ship.
Into
the
longboat.
Jack.
The
Pearl.
She's
only
a
ship,
mate.
He's
right.
-
It's
a
lot
of
open
water.
We
have
to
try.
We
can
get
away
Abandon
ship.
Abandon
ship
or
abandon
hope.
Thank
yöu,
Jack.
We're
not
free
yet,
love.
yöu
came
back.
I
always
knew
yöu
were
a
good
man.
Prepare
to
cast
off.
Come
on,
Will.
Step
to!

It's
after
yöu,
not
the
ship.
It's
not
us.
This
is
the
only
way,
don't
yöu
see?
I'm
not
sorry.
Pirate.
Where's
Jack?
He
elected
to
stay
behind
Go!
Bugger.
Bugger,
bugger,
Come
on!
Just
got
it.
Come
on.

Not
so
bad.
Oh.
Hello,
beastie.
Jack
Sparrow,
our
debt
is
settled.
The
captain
goes
down
with
his
ship.
Turns
out
not
even
Jack
Sparrow
Open
the
chest.
Open
the
chest.
I
need
to
see
it!
Damn
yöu,
Jack
Sparrow!

The
last
of
our
ships
is
returned.
Is
there
any
news
on
the
chest?
None.
But
one
of
the
ships
He
had
these.
I
took
the
liberty
of
filling
in
my
name.
If
yöu
intend
to
claim
these,
Do
yöu
have
the
compass?
Better.

The
heart
of
Davy
Jones.
Against
the
cold...
and
the
sorrow.
It's
a
shame.
I
know
yöu're
thinking
that
with
the
Pearl
yöu
could
have
captured
the
devil
Doesn't
matter
now.
The
Pearl
is
gone,
along
with
its
captain.

Aye.
And
already
the
world
He
fooled
us
all
right
till
the
end,
but
I
guess
that
honest
streak
To
Jack
Sparrow.
-
Never
another
like
Captain
Jack.
He
was
a
good
man.
If
there
was
anything
could
be
done
-
Elizabeth.
Hm?
What
would
yöu...
Hm?
What
would
any
of
yöu
Would
yöu
sail
to
the
ends
of
the
Earth
to
fetch
back
witty
Jack
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

Aye.
Yes.
Aye.
All
right.
But
if
yöu
go
and
brave
the
weird
then
yöu
will
need
a
captain
So
tell
me,
"Hope
You've
Liked
&
Enjoyed
The
Movie"
