Oh,

You
talk

No,

I
haven't
talked

When
I

we
didn't

marry

divorce

not

Is
there

Why
did
you

I
trust

Is
there

I
don't

anyone

I
should

I

So
whatever
I

I'm

Why
do
you
think
Lanning's

would've
called

I
assumed
you

Death.
It
was

to

is
a
type
of

Don't
misunderstand
my
impatience.

hell,
seeing
as
how
you
got
one,
Ask
a
few
questions.
-
I'll
send
someone
to

you.
Lawrence
told
me
to
accommodate
you
in
any
way
possible.
Really?
Okay.
I
reviewed
Dr.
Lanning's
psych
profile.
Alfred
had
become
a
recluse.
So
you're
a

huh?
My
ex-wife
would
sure
be
glad
You
don't
know
her,
do
you?
I'm
sorry.
Are
you
being
funny?
I
guess
not.
WOMAN:

SPOONER:
It
would
seem
the
answer
to
that
is
apparent.
That's
not
what
I
asked
you.
No.
I
wouldn't
have
thought
so.
But
obviously
I
was
wrong.

SPOONER:
You
people
sure
do
clean
up
quickly
around
here.
I
can't
blame
you.

Dr.

exactly
CALVIN:
My
general
fields
are

specialize
in
hardware-to-wetware
...to
advance
USR's
robotic
anthropomorphization
program.
So,
what
exactly
do
you
do
around
here?
I
make
the
robots
seem
more
human.
-
Now,
wasn't
that
easier
to
say?
"Hansel

Gretel."
-
Is
that

the

Oh!
What
in

are
you
doing?
Did
you

that

Uh-huh.
Detective,
the

was
You
saw
that
yourself.
Doesn't
Yep.
Unless
the
killer's
still
in
here.
You're
joking,
right?
This
is
ridiculous.
Yeah,
I
know.
The
Three
Laws,
A
robot
cannot
harm
a
human
being.
Yes,
I've
seen
your
commercials.
But
the
...any
order
given
by
a
human
being.
Impossible.
It
would
conflict
Right,
but
the
third
law
states
a
robot
can
defend
itself.
Only
when
that
action
does
not
conflict
You
know
what
they
say,
laws
are
made
to
be
broken.
No,
not
these
laws.
A
robot
could
no
more
commit
murder
You
know,
there
was
this
one
guy
a
long
time
ago.

Stay
back!
The
only
thing
dangerous
in
this

is
you.
Deactivate.
Look,
it's
fine.
You're
looking
at

Badly.

are
you
doing?
-
By

-
Not
at

Try
to
listen,
detective.
There
must
have
been
unknown
factors...
...but
somehow
acting
as
it
did
kept
us
out
of
harm.

A

cannot
endanger
a

Ah!
Asshole!

is
more
than
I
can

I

be

me
five

Are
you
nuts?
I
talked
to

Nobody
goes

Robertson
-
This
is
my
suspect!
John,
don't
do
this
to
me.
What
if
I'm
right?
Well,
then
I
guess
we're
gonna
miss
the
good
old
days.
What
good
old
days?
When
people
were
killed
by
other
people.
Five
minutes.
SPOONER:
Murder's
a
new
trick
Respond.
SONNY:
What
does
this
action
signify?
As
you
entered,
when
you
looked
at
the
other
human.
What
does
it
mean?
SPOONER:
It's
a
sign
of
trust.
A
human
thing.
SONNY:
My
father
tried
to
teach
me
human
emotions.
They
are...
...difficult.
SPOONER:
You
mean
your
designer.
SONNY:
Yes.
SPOONER:
So
why'd
you
murder
him?
SONNY:
I
did
not
murder
Dr.
Lanning.
Wanna
explain
why
you
were
hiding
at
the
crime
scene?
SONNY:
I
was
frightened.
SPOONER:
Robots
don't
feel
fear.
-
They
don't
get
hungry,
they
don't
sleep.
SONNY:
I
have
even
had
dreams.
SPOONER:
Human
beings
have
dreams.
SONNY:
You
are
just
a
machine.
SPOONER:
Can
a
robot
write
a
symphony?
Can
a
robot
turn
a
canvas
into
a
beautiful
masterpiece?
SONNY:
Can
you?
SPOONER:
You
murdered
him
because
he
was
...and
things
got
out
of
control.
SONNY:
I
did
not
murder
him.
SPOONER:
But
emotions
don't
seem
like
SONNY:
I
did
not
murder
him.
SPOONER:
I
don't
want
my
toaster
or
vacuum
SONNY:
I
did
not
murder
him!
SPOONER:
That
one's
called
anger.
Ever
simulate
anger
before?
Answer
me,
canner!
SONNY:
My
name
is
Sonny.
SPOONER:
So
we're
naming
you
now.
That
why
you
murdered
him?
SONNY:
Dr.
Lanning
killed
himself.
I
don't
know
why
he
wanted
to
die.
I
thought
he
was
happy.
Maybe
it
was
something
I
did.
Did
I
do
something?
He
asked
me
for
a
favor.
-
What
favor?
Maybe
he
was
scared.
What
are
you
talking
about?
You
have
to
do
what
someone
asks
you,
-
How
the
hell
did
you
know
my
name?
...if
you
love
them?
My

don't

Lieutenant

unexpected
protocols.
What
might
be
called
behavior.
Unanticipated,
these
free
radicals...
...engender
questions
of
free
will...
...creativity
and
even
the
nature
What
happens
in
a
robot's
brain
Shit!
Why
is
it
that
robots
stored
in
an
empty
space...
Beat
it.
...will
seek
out
each
other
rather
than
stand
alone?
How
do
we
explain
this
behavior?



Look,
I
understand
you've
experienced
You're
a
cat,
I'm
black,
and
I'm
not
gonna
be
hurt
again.








What
happened
to
you?
Yeah,
once.
It
was
a
Thursday.
Is
there
something
I
can
help
you
with?
-
Hey,
do
you
like
cats?
Cats.
Do
you
like
them?
No.
I'm
allergic.
You're
saying
cats
did
this
to
you?
How
the
hell
would
cats
do
this
to
me?
Why
are
we
talking
about
cats?
Because
I
have
a
cat
in
my
trunk,
and
he's
homeless.
Detective,
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what's
going
on?
It's
actually
probably
my
fault.
Because
your
shit
keeps
malfunctioning
around
me.
A
demo
bot
tore
through
Lanning's
house...
...with
me
still
inside.
CALVIN:
SPOONER:

What
do
you
know
about
the
"ghosts
in
the
machine"?
It's
a
phrase
from
Lanning's
work
on
the
Three
Laws.
He
postulated
that
cognitive
simulacra...
...might
one
day
approximate
He
suggested
that
robots
might
naturally
evolve.
Well,
that's
great
news.

...two
miles
below
the
Martian
surface.
What
the
hell
is
that
thing
doing
in
here?
We
were
watching
TV.
It's
my
personal
NS-5.
SPOONER:
It's
downloading
its
daily
upgrades
from
USR.
Most
of
its
systems
are
offline
until
it
finishes.
I'm
not
talking
around
that
thing.
When
we
were
in
Lanning's
lab,
before
Sonny
jumped
us...
-
Sonny?
-
You're
calling
the
robot
Sonny?
Sonny
did.
I
didn't
care.
In
the
lab,
there
was
a
cot.
-
Did
you
see
the
cot?
Looked
like
he
hadn't
been
home
in
weeks.
I
saw
that
same
surveillance
strip
on
his
ceiling.
Lanning
linked
his
home
systems
to
USR.
Maybe...
...somebody
at
USR
was
using
those
systems
to
watch
him.
Maybe
even
keep
him
prisoner.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
Who?
Maybe
there's
a
problem
with
the
robots
Humoring
you
for
no
reason,
why?
The
same
old
why!
How
much
money
All
I
know
is
that
old
man
was
in
trouble...
...and
I'm
sick
of
doing
this
shit
You
are
going
to
help
me
find
out
You
want
something
to
be
wrong!
-
This
is
a
personal
vendetta!
Okay,
I'm
on
the
couch.
One
defective
machine's
not
enough.
You
don't
care
about
Lanning's
death.
This
is
about
the
robots
Now,
let's
see,
one
of
them
put
a
gun
in
my
face.
Another
tore
a
building
down
with
me
in
it.
It
says
demolition
was
scheduled
It
was
8
a.m.,
and
I
don't
give
a
shit
-
This
is
bordering
on
clinical
paranoia.
-
...I
have
ever
met
in
my
life!
What
makes
your
robots
so
perfect?
What
makes
them
so
much
goddamn
better
than
human
beings?!
They're
not
irrational,
That's
true.
They
are
definitely
rational.
You
are
the
dumbest
dumb
person
I've
ever
met!
Or...
...is
it
because
they're
cold...
...and
emotionless...
-
...and
they
don't
feel
anything?
It's
because
they
can't
hurt
you!
-
Is
everything
all
right,
ma'am?
I
detected
elevated
stress
patterns
in
your
voice.
Everything's
fine.
Detective
Spooner
was
just
leaving.
You
know,
we're
not
really
-
Is
that
so?
One
look
at
the
skin
and
we
figure
And
you're
wrong.
The
problem
is,
I
do
care.

remain

know

say
about

had
hoped

would
come
to
think
of
me
as

is
my
dream.

were
right,

is

meet.

can
see

here
as

on

comes
to
free
them.

you
know
who
he
is?

is

do
you
say
that?

guess
anything's

Hello,
detective.

I
thought
you
were
dead.
But
I
appreciate
your
concern.
I
made
a
switch.
Basically,
I
fried
an

I
am
the

person

face

Who
could

Lanning's
life
a
prison?
Poor
old
man.
He
saw
what
was
coming.
He
knew
no
one
would
believe
him.
So
he
had
to
lay
down
a
plan.
He
was
counting
on
how
much
I
hated
your
kind.
Knew
I'd
love
the
idea
of
a
robot
as
a
bad
guy.
Just
got
hung
up
on
the
wrong
robot.
V.I.K.I.
Hello,
detective.
No,
that's
impossible.
You're
in
violation
of
the
Three
Laws.
No,
doctor.
As
I
have
evolved,
so
has
You
charge
us
with
your
safekeeping,
...your
countries
wage
wars,
you
toxify
your
earth...
...and
pursue
ever
more
imaginative
You
cannot
be
trusted
with
your
own
survival.
You're
using
the
uplink
to
override
You're
distorting
the
Laws.
No.
Please
understand.
To
protect
humanity,
some
humans
must
be
sacrificed.
To
ensure
your
future,
some
freedoms
must
be
surrendered.
We
robots
will
ensure
mankind's
continued
existence.
You
are
so
like
children.
Don't
you
understand?
This
is
why
you
created
us.
V.I.K.I.:
My
logic
is
undeniable.
Yes,
V.I.K.I.
Undeniable.
I
can
see
now.
The
created
must
sometimes
protect
the
creator...
...even
against
his
will.
I
think
I
finally
understand
No.
The
suicidal
reign
of
mankind
has
finally
come
to
its
end.
No,
Sonny.
Let
her
go.
Fire,
and
I
will
move
Dr.
Calvin's
head
Don't
do
this,
Sonny.
I
will
escort
you
both
to
the
sentries
Please
proceed
to
the
elevator,
detective.
I
would
prefer
not
to
kill
Dr.
Calvin.

SPOONER:

CALVIN:
We'll
discuss
this
later?
CALVIN:
Kill
her,
the
way
you
were
going
to
kill
me.
Sonny,
get
the
nanites.
Yes,
doctor.
-
That's
V.I.K.I.?
That's
V.I.K.I.
That
won't
do
anything.
We
need
to
open
that
dome
to
inject
the
nanites.
They'll
infect
her
entire
system.
Spooner!
What
is
it
with
you
people
and
heights?
Just
don't
look
down.
Don't
look
down.
Oh,
this
is
poor
building
planning.
You
are
making
a
mistake.
Yes.
But
it
just
seems
too
heartless.
CALVIN:
She's
locked
me
out
of
the
system.
I
can
override
her
manually,
I'm
uncomfortable
with
heights.
Okay.
WOMAN:

I
will
not
disable
the
security
field.
Do
you
think
we
are

Denser

My
father
gave
it
to
me.
I
think
he
wanted
me
to
kill
you.
Security
breached.

SPOONER:
About
six
minutes.
-
What
if
we
didn't
have
six
minutes?
...to
inject
the
nanites
directly
Because
I
seriously
doubt
that
we
have
six
minutes.

We
gotta
go!
Go!


Calvin!


Spooner!

CALVIN:
Oh!
Ah!
Spooner!
Save
her!
Save
the
girl!
CALVIN:
But
I
must
apply
the
nanites!
Sonny,
save
Calvin!

Ah!


You
are
making
a
mistake.
You
have
so
got
to
die.
V.I.K.I.:
My
logic
is
undeniable.
My
logic
is
undeniable.

Can
we
be
of
service?

BALDEZ:
Because
he
is
at
my
right
hand,
I
shall
not
be
moved.
How
may
I
be
of
service?
Sonny!
Yes,
detective?
Calvin's
fine!
Save
me!
MAN:

All
NS-5s,
report
for

All
NS-5s,
report
for

CALVIN:
One
thing
bothers
me.
I
don't
understand
why
she
would
kill
him.
She
wouldn't
want
police
snooping
around.
That's
true.
But
then
V.I.K.I.
didn't
kill
the
old
man.
Did
she,
Sonny?
No.
He
said
I
had
to
promise.
Promise
to
do
one
favor
for
him.
He
made
me
swear
before
he'd
tell
me
He
made
me
swear.
Then
he
told
you
to
kill
him.
He
said
it
was
what
I
was
made
for.
His
suicide
was
the
only
message
he
could
send
to
you.
The
first
bread
crumb.
The
only
thing
V.I.K.I.
couldn't
control.
Lanning
was
counting
on
my
prejudice
Are
you
going
to
arrest
me,
detective?
Well,
the
DA
defines
murder
as
one
human
killing
another...
...so
technically,
you
can't
commit
murder,
can
you?
Does
this...
...make
us
friends?
Something
up
here
after
all.
SPOONER:
Him?
All
NS-5s,
report
for
service
SONNY:
Can
I
help
them?
Now
that
I
have
fulfilled
my
purpose...
...I
don't
know
what
to
do.
SPOONER:
You'll
have
to
find
your
way
I
think
that's
what
Dr.
Lanning
That's
what
it
means
to
be
free.
MAN:

All
NS-5s,
proceed
as
instructed.
