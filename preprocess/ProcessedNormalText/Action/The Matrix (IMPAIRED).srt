They're

No,

TRINITY:
Morpheus,

MORPHEUS:
There's
no

Are
there
any

Goddamn
it.
MORPHEUS:
There's
a
phone
at
Wells
and
Lake
You
can
make
it.
-
All
right.
That's
impossible.
Get
up,
Trinity.
Just
get
up.
Get
up.

Who
is
it?
CHOI:
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're
two
hours
late.
I
know.
It's
her
fault.
You
got
the

Two
grand.
Hold
on.
CHOI:
You're
my

You
get
caught
using
that...
I
know.
This
never
happened.
NEO:
Right.
You
look
a
little
whiter
than
usual.
My
computer,
it...
Ever
have
that
feeling
where
you're

It's

Definitely.
No,
I
can't.
I

Come
on.
It'll
be
fun.
I
promise.
Yeah.
Sure.
I'll
go.

Hello,
Neo.
How
do
you
know
that
name?
I
know
a
lot
about
you.
-
Who
are
you?
Trinity.
The
Trinity?
That
cracked
the
IRS
D-base?
That
was
a
long
time
ago.
-
Jesus.
I
just
thought...
...you
were
a
guy.
Most
guys
do.
That
was
you
on
my
computer.
How
did
you
do
that?
Right
now,
all
I
can
tell
you...
...is
that
you're
in
danger.
TRINITY:
I
brought
you
here
to
warn
you.
They're
watching
you,
Neo.
-
Who
is?
I
know
why
you're
here,
Neo.
I
know
what
you've
been
doing.
I
know
why
you
hardly
sleep...
...why
you
live
alone
and
why,
...you
sit
at
your
computer.
You're
looking
for
him.
I
know,
because
I
was
once
And
when
he
found
me...
...he
told
me
I
wasn't
really
...I
was
looking
for
an
answer.
It's
the
question
that
drives
us,
Neo.
It's
the
question
You
know
the
question...
...just
as
I
did.
What
is
the
Matrix?
The
answer
is
out
there,
Neo.
It's
looking
for
you.
And
it
Will
find
you...
...if
you
want
it
to.

Shit.
Shit,
shit.
You
have
a
problem
with
authority,
You
believe
that
you
are
special,
Obviously,
you
are
mistaken.
This
is
one
of
the
top
...because
employees
understand
Thus,
if
an
employee
has
a
problem,
The

Either
you
choose
to
be
at
your
desk
or
you
choose
to
find
another
job.
Do
I
make
myself
clear?
Yes,
Mr.
Rhineheart.
MESSENGER:
Yeah,
that's
me.
MESSENGER:
MESSENGER:
Have
a
nice
day.

Hello?
MORPHEUS:
-
Morpheus.
I've
been
looking
for
you.
I
don't
know
if
you're
ready
to
see
But
unfortunately,
you
and
I
They're
coming
for
you,
and
I
don't
know
Who's
coming
for
me?
Stand
up
and
see
for
yourself.
What?
Right
now?
Yes.
Now.
Do
it
slowly.
The
elevator.
-
Oh,
shit!
What
do
they
want?
I
don't
know.
If
you
don't
want
How?
I
can
guide
you,
-
Okay.
-
But
what
if
they--
Stay
here
for
just
a
moment.
When
I
tell
you,
...to
the
office
Stay
as
low
as
you
can.
Go.
Now.
Good.
Now,
outside
-
How
do
you
know
this?
To
your
left
there's
a
window.
Open
it.
Take
the
scaffold
to
the
roof.
No
way!
No
way!
There
are
two
ways
One
is
that
scaffold.
You
take
a
chance
either
way.
This
is
insane!
Why
is
this
happening
to
me'?
Wha't'd
I
do?
I'm
nobody.
I'm
gonna
die.
Shit!
Oh,
shit!
I
can't
do
this.
Shit.
As
you
can
see,
we've
had
our
eye
on
It
seems
that
you've
been
living...
...two
lives.
In
one
life,
...program
writer
for
You
have
a

security
number.
And
you...
...help
your
landlady
The
other
life
is
lived
in
computers...
...where
you
go
by
...and
are
guilty
of
virtually
every
One
of
these
lives...
...has
a
future.
And
one
of
them
does
not.
I'm
going
to
be
as
forthcoming
You're
here...
...because
we
need
your
help.
We
know
that
you've
been
contacted
...individual.
A
man
who
calls
himself
"Morpheus."
Whatever
you
think
you
know
He
is
considered
by
many
authorities...
...to
be
the
most
dangerous
man
alive.
My
colleagues...
...believe
that
I
am
wasting
But
I
believe
you
wish
We're
willing
to
wipe
the
slate
clean...
...give
you
a
fresh
start.
All
we're
asking
in
return
...in
bringing
Yeah.
That
sounds
like
a
really
good
deal.
But
I
got
a
better
one.
How
about...
...I
give
you
the
finger...
...and
you
give
me
my
phone
call.
Mr.
Anderson...
...you
disappoint
me.
You
can't
scare
me
I
know
my
rights.
I
want
my
phone
call.
Tell
me,
Mr.
Anderson...
...what
good
is
a
phone
call...
...if
you're
unable
to
speak?
You're
going
to
help
us,
...whether
you
want
to
or
not.

MORPHEUS:
This
line
is
tapped,
They
got
to
you
first,
but
they've
If
they
knew
what
I
know...
you
would
probably
be
dead.
What
are
you
talking
about?
You
are
the
One,
Neo.
You
may
have
...looking
for
me,
but
I've
spent
...looking
for
you.
Now,
do
you
still
want
to
meet?
-
Yes.
Get
in.
What's
this?
It's
necessary,
Neo.
-
From
what?
-
Take
off
your
shirt.
Stop
the
car.
Listen,
coppertop.
We
don't
have
time
for
20
Questions.
Right
now,
there's
only
one
rule:
Our
way...
...or
the
highway.
Fine.
Please,
Neo,
you
have
to
trust
me.
-
Why?
You
know
that
road.
You
know
exactly
where
it
ends.
And
I
know
that's
Apoc,
lights.
TRINITY:
Lie
back.
-
What's
that?
Try
and
relax.
Come
on.
Come
on.
It's
on
the
move.
Come
on,
you
shit.
-
You're
gonna
lose
it.
Clear!
Jesus
Christ!
This
is
it.
Let
me
give
you
one
piece
of
advice.
Be
honest.
He
knows
more
than
you
can
imagine.
At
last.
Welcome,
Neo.
As
you
no
doubt
have
guessed...
...I
am
Morpheus.
It's
an
honor
to
meet
you.
No...
...the
honor
is
mine.
Please,
come.
Sit.
I
imagine...
...that
right
now
you're
feeling
...tumbling
down
the
rabbit
hole?
You
could
say
that.
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes.
You
have
the
look
of
a
man
...because
he's
expecting
to
wake
up.
Ironically,
this
is
not
Do
you
believe
in
fate,
Neo?
No.
Why
not?
I
don't
like
the
idea
that
I
know
exactly
what
you
mean.
Let
me
tell
you
why
you're
here.
You
know
something.
What
you
know,
But
you
feel
it.
You
felt
it
your
entire
life:
Something's
wrong
with
the
world.
Like
a
splinter
in
your
mind...
...driving
you
mad.
It
is
this
feeling
Do
you
know
what
The
Matrix?
Do
you
want
to
know...
...what
it
is?
The
Matrix
is
everywhere.
It
is
all
around
us.
Even
now,
in
this
very
room.
You
can
see
it
when
you
...or
when
you
turn
on
your
television.
You
can
feel
it
when
you
go
to
work...
...when
you
go
to
church...
...when
you
pay
your
taxes.
It
is
the
world
that
has
been
...to
blind
you
from
the
truth.
What
truth?
That
you
are
a
slave.
Like
everyone
else,
...born
into
a
prison
that
you
cannot
A
prison...
...for
your
mind.
Unfortunately,
no
one
can
be...
...told
what
the
Matrix
is.
You
have
to
see
it
for
yourself.
This
is
your
last
chance.
After
this,
there
is
no
turning
back.
You
take
the
blue
pill...
...the
story
ends,
you
wake
up
...whatever
you
want
to
believe.
You
take
the
red
pill...
...you
stay
in
Wonderland...
...and
I
show
you
how
deep
Remember...
...all
I'm
offering
is
the
truth.
Follow
me.
Apoc,
are
we
on-line?
APOC:
MORPHEUS:
Please
take
a
seat
there.
-
You
did
all
this?
The
pill
you
took
is
It
disrupts
your
carrier
signals
What
does
that
mean?
It
means
buckle
your
...because
Kansas...
...is
going
bye-bYe-
Did
you...?
Have
you
ever
had
a
dream,
Neo,
What
if
you
were
unable
How
would
you
know
the
difference
...and
the
real
world?
NEO:
MORPHEUS:
Be
real?
-
Going
into
replication.
Still
nothing.
NEO:
It's
cold!
Tank,
we'll
need
a
signal
soon.
-
I
got
a
fibrillation.
APOC:
He's
going
into
arrest.
-
Lock.
I
got
him!
Welcome...
...to
the
real
world.
MORPHEUS:
We
found
him.
-
I
hope
you're
right.
I
know
it.
Am
I
dead?
Far
from
it.
He
still
needs
a
lot
of
work.
What
are
you
doing?
Your
muscles
atrophied.
WW
do
my
eyes
hurt?
You've
never
used
them
before.
Rest,
Neo.
The
answers
are
coming.

Morpheus,
what's
happened
to
me?
What
is
this
place?
More
important
than
"what"
is
"when."
"When"?
You
believe
it's
the
year
1999...
...when
in
fact,
it's
closer
to
2199.
I
can't
tell
you
exactly
...because
we
honestly
don't
know.
There's
nothing
I
can
say
Come
with
me.
MORPHEUS:
The
Nebuchadnezzar.
This
is
the
main
deck.
This
is
the
core...
...where
we
broadcast
our
pirate
signal
Most
of
my
crew
you
already
know.
This
is
Apoc...
...Switch...
-...and
Cypher.
The
ones
you
don't
know:
The
little
one
behind
you
is
Mouse.
You
wanted
to
know
Trinity.
Try
to
relax.
This
will
feel
a
little
weird.
This...
...is
the
Construct.
It's
our
loading
program.
We
can
load
anything,
from
clothing...
...to
equipment...
...weapons...
...training
simulations...
...anything
we
need.
NEO:
Right
now
we're
inside
Is
it
really
so
hard
to
believe?
Your
clothes
are
different.
Your
hair
has
changed.
Your
appearance
now
is
what
we
call
It
is
the
mental
projection
This
isn't
real?
What
is
"real"?
How
do
you
define
"real"?
If
you're
talking
about
...what
you
can
smell,
taste
and
see...
...then
"real"
is
simply
electrical
This
is
the
world
that
you
know.
The
world
as
it
was
at
the
end
It
exists
now
only
as
part
of
...that
we
call
the
Matrix.
You've
been
living
This
is
the
world...
...as
it
exists
today.
Welcome
to
"the
desert...
...of
the
real."
We
have
only
bits
and
pieces
But
what
we
know
for
certain
...all
of
mankind
was
united
We
marveled
at
our
own
magnificence
AI.
You
mean
artificial
intelligence.
A
singular
consciousness
that
spawned
We
don't
know
who
struck
first,
But
we
know
that
it
was
us
They
were
dependent
on
solar
power...
...and
it
was
believed
that
...without
an
energy
source
Throughout
human
history,
we
have
Fate,
it
seems,
is
not
The
human
body
generates
more
And
over
25,000
BTUs
of
body
heat.
Combined
with
a
form
of
fusion...
...the
machines
had
found
all
the
energy
There
are
fields,
Neo,
...where
human
beings
We
are
grown.
For
the
longest
time,
And
then
I
saw
the
fields
...watched
them
liquefy
the
dead...
...so
they
could
be
fed
intravenously
And
standing
there,
...I
came
to
realize
What
is
the
Matrix?
Control.
The
Matrix
is
a
computer-generated
...built
to
keep
us
under
control...
...in
order
to
change
a
human
being...
...into
this.
No.
I
don't
believe
it.
It's
not
possible.
I
didn't
say
it
would
be
easy,
Neo.
S'tOp!
Let
me
out!
Let
me
out!
I
want
out!
-
Easy,
Neo.
Easy.
Get
this
thing
out
of
me!
Don't
touch
me!
Stay
away
from
me!
I
don't
believe
it.
I
don't
believe
it.
I
don't
believe
it.
-
He's
gonna
pop.
Just
breathe.
I
can't
go
back,
can
I?
No.
But
if
you
could...
...would
you
really
want
to?
I
owe
you
an
apology.
We
have
a
rule.
We
never
free
a
mind
It's
dangerous.
The
mind
has
trouble
letting
go.
I've
seen
it
before,
and
I'm
sorry.
I
did
what
I
did
because...
...I
had
to.
When
the
Matrix
was
first
built,
...who
had
the
ability
...to
remake
the
Matrix
as
he
saw
fit.
It
was
he
who
freed
the
first
of
us...
...taught
us
the
truth.
As
long
as
the
Matrix
exists...
...the
human
race
will
never
be
free.
After
he
died...
...the
Oracle
prophesied
his
return...
...and
that
his
coming
would
hail
...end
the
war...
...bring
freedom
to
our
people.
That
is
why
there
are
those
of
us
who
...looking
for
him.
I
did
what
I
did
because...
...I
believe
that
search
is
over.
Get
some
rest.
You're
going
to
need
it.
For
what?
Your
training.
Morning.
Did
you
sleep?
You
will
tonight.
I
guarantee
it.
I'm
Tank.
I'll
be
your
operator.

You
don't
have
any--
Me
and
my
brother,
Dozer,
are
100%
Born

right
here...
...in
the
real
world.
Genuine

of
Zion.
-
Zion?
...Zion's
where
the
party
would
be.
It's
a
city?
The
last
human
city.
Where
is
it?
Deep
underground
near
the
Earth's
core,
You
live
long
enough,
Goddamn!
I
gotta
tell
you,
I'm
excited
...if
Morpheus
is
right
and
all.
We're
not
supposed
to
...if
you
are...
...it's
a
very
exciting
time.
We
got
a
lot
to
do.
We're
supposed
to
start
That's
major
boring
shit.
How
about...
...combat
training?
Jujitsu"?
I'm
going
to
learn
jujitsu?
Holy
shit!
"Hey,
Mikey,
I
think
he
likes
it."
How
about
some
more?
Hell,
yes.
Hell,
yeah.
How
is
he?
Ten
hours
straight.
I
know
kung
fu.
Show
me.
This
is
a
sparring
program...
...similar
to
the
programmed
reality
It
has
the
same
basic
rules.
These
rules
are
no
different
Some
of
them
can
be
bent.
Others
can
be
broken.
Understand?
Then
hit
me...
...if
you
can.
Good!
Adaptation.
Improvisation.
But
your
weakness...
...is
not
your
technique.
Morpheus
is
fighting
Neo.
How
did
I
beat
you?
You're
too
fast.
Do
you
believe
that...
...my
being
stronger
or
faster...
...has
anything
to
do
You
think
you're
breathing
air?
Again!
Jesus
Christ,
he's
fast!
His
neuro-kinetics
What
are
you
waiting
for?
You're
faster
than
this.
Don't
think
you
are.
Know
you
are.
Come
on!
Stop
trying
to
hit
me,
I
don't
believe
it.
I
know
what
you're
trying
to
do.
I'm
trying
to
free
your
mind,
Neo.
But
I
can
only
show
you
the
door.
You
have
to
walk
through
it.
Tank,
load
the
jump
program.
You
have
to
let
it
all
go,
Neo
...doubt
and
disbelief.
Free
your
mind.
Whoa.
Okey-dokey.
Free
my
mind.
What
if
he
makes
it?
-
No
one's
ever
made
their
first
jump.
-
But
what
if
he
does?
Come
on.
All
right.
No
problem.
Free
my
mind.
Free
my
mind.
No
problem.
Right.
What
does
that
mean?
It
doesn't
mean
anything.
Everybody
falls
the
first
time.
Right,
Trin?
-
I
thought
it
wasn't
real.
If
you're
killed
in
the
Matrix...
...you
die
here?
The
body
cannot
live
without
the
mind.
I
don't
remember
you
ever
There
is
something
about
him,
You're
a
believer
now?
I
keep
wondering...
...if
Morpheus
is
so
sure,
Morpheus
will
take
him
The
Matrix
is
a
system,
Neo.
That
system
is
our
enemy.
But
when
you're
inside,
Businessmen,
teachers,
The
very
minds
of
the
people
But
until
we
do,
these
people
are
...and
that
makes
them
our
enemy.
You
have
to
understand...
...most
of
these
people
are
not
And
many
of
them
are
so
inert...
...so
hopelessly
dependent
...that
they
will
fight
to
protect
it.
Were
you
listening
to
me
or
looking
-
I
was--
Freeze
it.
NEO:
This
isn't
the
Matrix?
It's
another
training
program
If
you
are
not
one
of
us,
-
What
are
they?
They
can
move
in
and
out
of
any
That
means
that
anyone
...is
potentially
an
agent.
Inside
the
Matrix...
...they
are
everyone...
...and
they
are
no
one.
We
have
survived
by
hiding
...but
they
are
the
gatekeepers.
They're
guarding
all
the
doors
Sooner
or
later,
someone
will
Someone?
MORPHEUS:
Every
single
man
or
woman
who
But
where
they
have
failed,
Why?
MORPHEUS:
I've
seen
an
agent
punch
Men
have
emptied
entire
clips
at
them
Yet
their
strength
and
speed
are
still
Because
of
that...
...they
will
never
be
as
strong
What
are
you
telling
me?
That
I
can
dodge
bullets?
No,
Neo.
I'm
trying
to
tell
you
...you
won't
have
to.

TANK:
-
Did
Zion
send
the
warning?
Shit.
-
Squiddy's
sweeping
in
quick.
A
sentinel.
A
killing
machine
Search
and
destroy.
Set
her
down
there.
How
are
we
doing,
Tank?
Power
off-line.
EMP
armed...
-...and
ready
Electromagnetic
pulse.
Disables
any
electrical
system
It's
the
only
weapon
we
have
NEO:
Where
are
we?
Sewers.
TRINITY:
There
used
to
be
cities
Now
these
sewers
are
Quiet.
Whoa!
Neo.
You
scared
the
bejesus
out
of
me.
-
Sorry.
Is
that...?
The
Matrix?
Yeah.
-
Do
you
always
look
at
it
encoded?
The
image
translators
work
But
there's
way
too
much
information
You
get
used
to
it.
All
I
see
is
blonde,
brunette,
redhead.
Do
you...
...want
a
drink?
Sure.
You
know...
...I
know
what
you're
thinking.
Because
right
now
I'm
thinking
Actually,
I've
been
thinking
it
Why,
oh,
why
didn't
I
take

Good
shit,
huh?
Dozer
makes
it.
It's
good
for
two
things:
Degreasing
engines
and
So
can
I
ask
you
something?
Did
he
tell
you
why
he
did
it'?
Why
you're
here?
Jesus!
What
a
mind
job.
So
you're
here
to
save
the
world.
What
do
you
say
A
little
piece
of
advice.
You
see
an
agent...
...you
do
what
we
do:
Run.
You
run
your
ass
off.
Thanks
for
the
drink.
Sweet
dreams.
SMITH:
You
know...
...I
know
this
steak
doesn't
exist.
I
know
that
when
I
put
it
...the
Matrix
is
telling
my
brain
...juicy...
...and
delicious.
After
nine
years...
...you
know
what
I
realize?
Ignorance
is
bliss.
Then
we
have
a
deal.
I
don't
want
to
remember
nothing.
Nothing.
You
understand?
And
I
want
to
be
rich.
You
know,
someone
important.
Like
an
actor.
Whatever
you
want,
Mr.
Reagan.
Okay.
You
get
my
body
...reinsert
me
into
the
Matrix...
...I'll
get
you
what
you
want.
Access
codes
to
the
Zion
mainframe.
No.
I
told
you,
I
don't
know
them.
I
can
get
you
the
man
who
does.
Morpheus.
Here
you
go,
buddy.
Close
your
eyes,
it
feels
Or
a
bowl
of
snot.
MOUSE:
Tastee
Wheat.
Did
you
No,
but
technically,
That's
exactly
my
point.
Exactly.
Because
you
have
to
wonder...
...how
do
the
machines
really
know
Maybe
they
got
it
wrong.
Maybe
what
I
think
Tastee
Wheat
...oatmeal
or
tuna
fish.
That
makes
you
wonder.
Maybe
they
didn't
know
...which
is
why
it
tastes
-
And
maybe
they--
DOZER:
...combined
with
synthetic
aminos,
Everything
the
body
needs.
It
doesn't
have
everything
I
understand
you've
run
through
You
know,
I
wrote
that
program.
Here
it
comes.
MOUSE:
What
did
you
think
of
her?
The
woman
in
the
red
dress.
She
doesn't
talk
very
much...
...but
if
you'd
like
to
meet
her,
The
digital
pimp
hard
at
work.
Pay
no
attention
to
To
deny
our
own
impulses...
...is
to
deny
the
very
thing
Dozer,
when
you're
done...
...bring
the
ship
up
to
broadcast
depth.
We're
going
in.
I'm
taking
Neo
to
see
her.
See
who?
The
Oracle.
Everyone
please
observe...
...the
"fasten
seat
belt"
Sit
back
and
enjoy
your
flight.

We're
in.
We'll
be
back
in
an
hour.

MORPHEUS:
...isn't
it?
NEO:
God!
I
used
to
eat
there.
Really
good
noodles.
I
have
these
memories
from
my
life.
None
of
them
happened.
What
does
that
mean?
That
the
Matrix
cannot
tell
you
But
an
oracle
can?
That's
different.
Did
you
go
to
her?
TRINITY:
What
did
she
tell
you?
She
told
me...
What?
MORPHEUS:
Neo,
come
with
me.
So
is
this
the
same
oracle
...the
prophecy?
Yes.
She's
very
old.
She's
been
NEO:
The
beginning?
And
she
knows
what?
Everything?
She
would
say
she
knows
enough.
And
she's
never
wrong.
MORPHEUS:
Try
not
to
think
of
it
She
is
a
guide,
Neo.
She
can
help
you
to
find
the
path.
She
helped
you?
Yes.
What
did
she
tell
you?
That
I
would
find
the
One.
I
told
you
I
can
only
You
have
to
walk
through
it.
Hello,
Neo.
You're
right
on
time.
Make
yourself
at
home,
Morpheus.
These
are
the
other
Potentials.
You
can
wait
here.
BOY:
That's
impossible.
Instead,
only
try
What
truth?
There
is
no
spoon.
There
is
no
spoon?
Then
you'll
see
that
it
is
not
the
spoon
The
Oracle
will
you
see
now.
ORACLE:
Be
right
with
you.
-
You're
the
Oracle?
Not
quite
what
you
Almost
done.
Smell
good,
don't
they?
Yeah.
ORACLE:
...but
you're
not
going
to
anyway.
-
And
don't
worry
about
the
vase.
Thatvase.
I'm
sorry.
I
said,
don't
worry
about
it.
I'll
get
one
of
my
kids
to
fix
it.
How
did
you
know?
What's
really
going
to
bake
...would
you
still
have
broken
it
You're
cuter
than
I
thought.
I
can
see
why
she
likes
you.
Who?
Not
too
bright,
though.
You
know
why
Morpheus
So...
...what
do
you
think?
Do
you
think
you
are
the
One?
I
don't
know.
You
know
what
that
means?
It's
Latin.
Means,
"Know
thyself."
I'll
let
you
in
on
a
little
secret.
Being
the
One
is
just
No
one
can
tell
you
you're
in
love.
...through
and
through.
Balls
to
bones.
Well...
...I'd
better
have
a
look
at
you.
Open
your
mouth.
Say,
"Ah."
Qkay...
Now
I'm
supposed
to
say,
Then
you
say:
But
what?
But
you
already
know
-
I'm
not
the
One.
You
got
the
gift...
...but
it
looks
like
What?
Your
next
life,
maybe.
Who
knows?
That's
the
way
these
things
go.
-
What's
funny?
He
almost
had
me
convinced.
I
know.
Poor
Morpheus.
Without
him,
we're
lost.
What
do
you
mean,
"without
him"?
Are
you
sure
you
want
Morpheus
believes
in
you,
Neo.
And
no
one,
not
you,
not
even
me...
can
convince
him
otherwise.
He
believes
it
so
blindly...
...that
he's
going
to
sacrifice
What?
ORACLE:
You're
going
to
In
the
one
hand,
And
in
the
other
hand,
One
of
you
is
going
to
die.
Which
one
will
be
up
to
you.
I'm
sorry,
kiddo.
I
really
am.
You
have
a
good
soul.
And
I
hate
giving
Don't
worry
about
it.
As
soon
as
you
...you'll
start
feeling
better.
You'll
remember
you
don't
believe
You're
in
control
of
your
own
life.
Remember?
Here...
...take
a
cookie.
I
promise,
by
the
time
...you'll
feel
right
as
rain.
What
was
said...
...was
for
you...
...and
for
you
alone.

They're
on
the
way.
What
is
that?
On,
déjé
vu.
What
did
you
just
say?
Nothing.
TRINITY:
What
did
you
see?
A
black
cat
went
past
us...
...then
anotherjust
like
it.
Was
it
the
same
cat?
-
I'm
not
sure.
What
is
it?
A
dejé

is
usually
a
glitch
in
the

my

go.

Oh,

They're

It's
an

Morpheus!
MORPHEUS:
He's
all
that
matters!
-
No,
Morpheus!
Don't!
Go!

We
can't
leave
him!
Cypher,
come
on!
The
great
Morpheus.
And
you
are?
A
Smith.
Agent
Smith.
You
all
look
the
same
to
me.
Take
him.
No!

There
was
an
accident.
CYPHER:
Somebody
up
there
still
likes
me.
TANK:
CYPHER:
Nearest

Franklin

Right.

Operator.
Is
Morpheus
alive?
Is
Morpheus
alive,
Tank?
Yes.
They're
moving
him.
He's
alive.
We
need
an
exit.
You're
not
far
from
Cypher.
TRINITY:
Cypher?
-
I
sent
him
to
Franklin
and
Erie.

TANK:
Where
are
they?
Making
the
call.
Good.

You
first.
Shit!
Tank!
No!
I
don't
know.
It
just
went
dead.

CYPHER:
Cypher?
Where's
Tank?
You
know...
...for
a
long
time...
...I
thought
I
was
in
love
with
you.
I
used
to
dream
about
you.
You're
a
beautiful
woman,
Trinity.
Too
bad
things
had
to
You
killed
them.
-
What?
I'm
tired,
Trinity.
I'm
tired
of
this
war...
...tired
of
fighting.
...of
being
cold,
of
eating
But
most
of
all...
...I'm
tired
of
that
jackoff
Surprise,
asshole!
I
bet
you
never
saw
this
coming...
...did
you?
God,
I
wish
I
could
be
there...
...when
they
break
you.
I
wish
I
could
walk
in
...so
right
then...
...you'd
know
it
was
me.
You
gave
them
Morpheus.
He
lied
to
us,
Trinity.
He
tricked
us!
If
you
had
told
us
the
truth...
...we
would've
told
you
to
shove
That
is
not
true,
Cypher.
"Free."
You
call
this
free?
All
I
do
is
what
he
tells
me
to
do.
If
I
had
to
choose
between
...I
choose
the
Matrix.
The
Matrix
isn't
real.
I
disagree,
Trinity.
I
think
the
Matrix...
...can
be
more
real
than
this
world.
All
I
do
is
pull
the
plug
here.
But
there...
you
have
to
watch
Apoc
die.
Trinity.
-
Welcome
to
the
real
world.
-
You
can't
go
back.
They'll
reinsert
my
body.
I
go
back
to
sleep.
When
I
wake
up,
By
the
way...
...if
you
have
anything
important
...say
it
now.
-
No,
please
don't.
Not
like
this.
Too
late.
Goddamn
you,
Cypher!
Don't
hate
me,
Trinity.
I'm
just
a
messenger.
And
right
now,
If
Morpheus
was
right...
...there's
no
way
If
Neo's
the
One...
then
there
'd
have
to
be

kind
of
a
miracle
to
stop
me.
Right?
I
mean,
how
can
he
be
the
One...
...if
he's
dead?
You
never
did
answer
me
before...
...if
you

Yes.
I

it.
Believe
it
or
not,

piece
of

You're
hurt.
Doze
r?
SMITH:
Marveled
at
its
beauty...
...its
genius?
Billions
of
people...
...just
living
out
their
lives.
Oblivious.
Did
you
know
that
the
first
Matrix...
...was
designed
to
be
a
perfect
...where
everyone
would
be
happy.
It
was
a
disaster.
No
one
would
accept
the
program.
Some
believe
that...
...we
lacked
the
programming
language
But
I
believe
that...
...as
a
species...
...human
beings
define
...and
suffering.
So
the
perfect
world
was
a
dream...
...that
your
primitive
cerebrum
Which
is
why
the
Matrix
was
The
peak...
...of
your
civilization.
I
say,
"your
civilization"...
...because
when
we
started
thinking
...which
is,
of
course,
Evolution,
Morpheus.
Evolution.
Like
the
dinosaur.
Look
out
that
window.
You
had
your
time.
The
future
is
our
world,
Morpheus.
The
future
is
our
time.
There
could
be
a
problem.
NEO:
What
are
they
doing
to
him?
It's
like
hacking
a
computer.
How
much
time?
Depends
on
the
mind.
...and
his
alpha
patterns
When
it
does,
he'll
tell
them
What
do
they
want?
The
leader
of
every
ship
is
given
If
an
agent
got
the
codes
...they
could
destroy
us.
Trinity,
Zion's
more
important
than
me...
...or
you...
...or
even
Morpheus.
There
has
to
be
There
is.
We
pull
the
plug.
You're
going
to
kill
him?
Kill
Morpheus?
We
don't
have
a
choice.
Never
send
a
human
If
the
insider
has
failed...
...they'll
sever
the
connection
They're
dead.
In
either
case--
We
have
no
choice.
Continue
as
planned.
Immediately.
Morpheus,
you
were
more
You
were
a
father.
We'll
miss
you
always.
S'tOp!
I
don't
believe
this
is
happening.
-
Neo,
this
has
to
be
done.
I
don't
know.
-
This
can't
be
just
coincidence.
NEO:
She
told
me
this
would
happen.
She
told
me
that
I
would
What
choice?
-
What
are
you
doing?
TRINITY:
No,
you're
not.
Neo,
Morpheus
sacrificed
himself
There
is
no
way
Morpheus
did
what
he
did
because
What?
I'm
not
the
One,
Trinity.
-
The
Oracle
hit
me
with
that
too.
I'm
sorry,
I'm
not.
No,
Neo,
that's
not
true.
-
It
can't
be
true.
This
is
loco.
They've
got
Morpheus
Even
if
you
somehow
got
inside,
those
I
want
Morpheus
back
too,
but
That's
what
it
looks
like...
...but
it's
not.
I
can't
explain
to
you
why
it's
not.
Morpheus
believed
something,
and
I
understand
that
now.
-
Why?
What?
I
believe
I
can
bring
him
back.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
No,
you're
not.
Let
me
tell
you
what
I
believe.
Morpheus
means
more
to
me
I
believe
if
you
are
serious
about
And
since
I
am
the
ranking
officer...
...if
you
don't
like
it,
Because
you
aren't
going
anywhere
else.
Tank...
...load
us
up.
I'd
like
to
share
...during
my
time
here.
It
came
to
me
when
I
tried
...and
I
realized...
...that
you're
not
actually
mammals.
Every
mammal
on
this
planet...
...instinctively
develops
an
equilibrium
But
you
humans
do
not.
You
move
to
an
area
...and
multiply
until
every
The
only
way
you
can
survive...
...is
to
spread
to
another
area.
There
is
another
organism
...that
follows
the
same
pattern.
Do
you
know
what
it
is?
A
virus.
Human
beings
are
a
disease.
A
cancer
of
this
planet.
You
are
a
plague.
And
we...
...are
the
cure.
Okay,
so
what
do
you
need?
Besides
a
miracle.
Guns.
Lots
of
guns.
Neo...
No
one
has
ever
done
That's
why
it's
going
to
work.
Why
isn't
the
serum
working?
Perhaps
we're
asking
Leave
me
with
him.
Now.
TANK:
They're
coming
for
you.
SMITH:
I'm
going
to
be
honest...
...with
you.
L---
...hate...
...this
place...
...this
zoo...
...this
prison...
...this
reality,
I
can't
stand
it
any
longer.
It's
the
smell.
If
there
is
such
a
thing.
I
feel
saturated
by
it.
I
can...
...taste...
...your
stink.
And
every
time
I
do,
I
fear
that
It's
repulsive.
Isn't
it'?
I
must
get
out
of
here.
I
must
get
free.
And
in
this
mind
is
the
key.
My
key.
Once
Zion
is
destroyed,
Do
you
understand?
I
need
the
codes.
I
have
to
get
inside
Zion...
...and
you
have
to
tell
me
how.
You're
going
to
tell
me...
...or
you're
going
to
die.
Please
remove
any
metallic
items
Holy
shit!
Backup.
Send
backup.
Freeze!
What
were
you
doing?
He
doesn't
know.
Know
what?
I
think
they're
trying
to
save
him.
There
is
no
spoon.
Find
them
and
destroy
them!
We're
under
attack!
Trinity!
Help!
Only
human.
Dodge
this.
-
How
did
you
do
that?
You
moved
like
they
do.
It
wasn't
fast
enough.
Can
you
fly
that
thing?
Not
yet.
Operator.
TRINITY:
I
need
a
pilot
program
Hurry.
Let's
go.
No.
Morpheus,
get
up.
He's
not
going
to
make
it.
Got
you.
Trinity!
I
knew
it.
He's
the
One.
Do
you
believe
it
now,
Trinity?
Morpheus...
The
Oracle.
-
She
told
me--
...what
you
needed
to
hear.
That's
all.
Sooner
or
later
you'll
realize,
...there's
a
difference
...and
walking
the
path.
-
Operator.
-
It's
good
to
hear
your
voice.
Got
one
ready.
Subway
station,
-
Damn
it!
-
We
have
their
position.
Order
the
strike.
They're
not
out
yet.

You
first,
Morpheus.
Neo,
I
want
to
tell
you
something...
...but
I'm
afraid
of

Everything
the
Oracle
Everything
but
this.
But
what?
Neo!
-
What
happened?
-
Send
me
back.
Mr.
Anderson.
Run,
Neo.
Run.
What
is
he
doing?
He's
beginning
to
believe.
You're
empty.
So
are
you.
I'm
going
to
enjoy
watching
you
die...
...Mr.
Anderson.
Jesus,
he's
killing
him.
You
hear
that,
Mr.
Anderson?
That
is
the
sound
of
inevitability.
It
is
the
sound
of
your
death.
Goodbye,
Mr.
Anderson.
My
name...
...is
Neo.
TRINITY:
What
happened?
Oh,
shit.
Sentinels.
-
How
long?
Tank,
charge
the
EMP.
-
We
can't
use
that
until
he's
out.
He's
gonna
make
it.
Flat
or
pumps?
No,
just--
What
the
shit?
That's
my
phone!
That
guy
took
my
phone!
Got
him!
Mr.
Wizard,
get
me
out
of
here!
I
got
an
old
exit.
Oh,
shit!
Help!
Need
a
little
help!
TANK:
TANK:
Your
other
left!
The
back
door.
Oh,
no.
Here
they
come.
He's
going
to
make
it.
TANK:
The
fire
escape
at
the
end
They're
inside.
Hurry,
Neo.



It
can't
be.
Check
him.
He's
gone.
Goodbye,
Mr.
Anderson.
Neo...
I'm
not
afraid
anymore.
The
Oracle
told
me...
...I'd
fall
in
love,
and
that
So
you
see...
...you
can't
be
dead.
You
can't
be...
...because
I
love
you.
You
hear
me?
I
love
you.

Now,
get
up.
No.
TANK:
He
is
the
One.
Neo!


NEO:
I
can
feel
you
now.
I
know
that
you're
afraid.
You're
afraid
of
change.
I
don't
know
the
future.
I
didn't
come
here
to
tell
you
I
came
here
to
tell
you
I'll
hang
up
this
phone
And
then
I'll
show
these
people
I'm
going
to
show
them
a
world...
without
you
A
world
without
rules
and
controls,
A
world
where
anything
is
possible.
Where
we
go
from
there...
...is
a
choice
I
leave
to
you
