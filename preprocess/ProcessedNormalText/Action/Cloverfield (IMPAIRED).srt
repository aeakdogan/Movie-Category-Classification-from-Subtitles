Well,

I'm
interested
in
other
things.
Like
you.
-
Oh,

Do

I'm
scared
of
it.

It's
only
30
minutes

You've
never
been
to
Coney
Island?
Oh,

God.

Yeah,
I
can't
wait
to...
What
are
you
doing?
What?
Oh,

right.
Well,
That's
the
only
way

That's
why
we

to
hurry.
We're
going...
We're
just
going
LILY:
I
want
you
to
go
around
and
get
testimonials
from
everyone.
JASON:
Why?
I
mean,

LILY:
I
know
it's
not
a
wedding.
I
can't
get
this.
I
don't
get...
I
mean,
'Cause,
I
mean,
I
don't...
-
That's
what
I
think
is
gonna
happen.

ROB:
You
totally
are.
You...
LILY:
Okay,

Can
you

the
viewfinder?
Yeah.

JASON:
That's
good!
That
was
good.
JASON:
I'm
not
lugging
this
thing
around
-
all
night
long.
This
is
important.
Stop
freaking
out.
JASON:
I
understand
that,
Lily,
-
No,
it
isn't.
Jason,
I
have
been
planning
this
-
All
I
want
you
to
do
is
help
me.
Okay.
All
right?
I
really
pissed
her
off.
Babe,
come
on.
JASON:
Hud?
Hud,
listen
to
me.
I
already
have
got
a
job.

I'm
doing
the

so...
but
this
is
more
important
than
the
sign.

No.
All
right.
You're
gonna
take
the
camera
and
film
people
wishing
Rob
good
luck.

That's
a

of
responsibility.

And
Marlena's
gonna
be
here.

She
is?

So
you're
gonna
take
that.

And
you're
gonna
talk
to
her...
-
For
Rob.

JASON:
Just
try
it
out.
JASON:
You
can,
just
do
mine...

Are
you
ready?
All
right.
Rob,
I
don't
even
know
what
to
say,
bro.
Best
of
luck

Japan.

I'm
proud
of
you.

That's
it.

GIRL
-
Hud,
what
are
you
doing?
But
I
thought
I
asked
Jason
to
do
that.
Oh,
yeah,
well,
Jason
asked
me
to
do
it,
I've
been
doing
it
really
well.
Well,
are
you
gonna
Because
it's
really
important.
No,
of
course.
I've
been
taking
it
-
Very
seriously.
Yeah,
you
wanna
do

Okay.
Okay.
Okay,
just
open
up
to
him,
-
the
last
thing
he
sees
you...
Robert
Hawkins,
I
can't
believe
you're
leaving
me
Oh!
Easy,
easy.
I
mean
And
I
know
we're
not
officially
family,
-
Not
fair,
'cause
I'm
gonna...
-
Okay.
But
I
think
of
you
as
my
brother,
So,
you
better
call
us.
Now
that
you
have
this
job,
-
Hud?
Yeah,
sorry.
No,
you're
good.
-
That
was
good!
I
thought
that
was
really,
really
good.
Yeah,
but
you
weren't
even
paying

HUD:
Okay.
Okay,
you
can
do
this.
Yeah.
You
got
this,
man.
You
got
this.

What's
up,
man?
What's
up?
Excuse
me!
Hey,
Marlena?

Hey,

thank
you.
I'm
just
coming
to
say
hi
to
Lily,
if
I'm
even
on
it,
I
think,
but
thanks.
Okay,
cool,
So
have
you
ever
been
to
a
wedding?
No,
I
get
what
you're
doing.
I
just...
Okay,
cool.
Okay.
Hey,
Rob,
Marlena.
I
think
we've
met,
like,
and
every
one
of
those
times
so
I
don't
really
even
know
what
to
say.
But
you
have
a
cool
job!

Like
you're
president
of
something!
Also
really
cool.
So

times
before.

What's
going
on?
Totally.
Yeah,

It's
nice
to
see
you

Easy,

Let's

That's
it.

Were
you
surprised?
No?
Can

No,

not.
Well,

by
the
way?
so

you
can
take

I
get

Yeah,
you
could.
All

problem
You

I

My
Fair
Lady.
That
was
wonderful.
Beth,

You
made
it.
JASON:
It
doesn't

It's

said
I
was
cute.
Yeah.

Hey,

everything
cool,
man?
Okay,
because...
I
don't
know,
Is
that
my
camera?
I
don't
know.
Your
brother
gave
it
to
me.
Did
you
switch
the
tape?
I
don't
know.
Was...
ROB:
Roller-coasters
are
fun,
but,
like,
Tape
was
in
here
when
I
got
it.
Why?
-
Rob,
why?
It
doesn't...
It's
stupid.
Okay,
are
you
sure
you're
cool?
Like,
we
haven't
been
-
Here.
Here,
man.
Come
on.
Excuse
me.
Sorry.
Excuse
me.
-
What's
wrong
with
you?
Hey,
I'm
filming
goodbyes
for
Rob.
Oh,
Hud,
I
don't
know.
Come
on,
he's
leaving.
-
I
mean,
can
we...
You're
not
gonna
be
able
Isn't
there
something
you
wanna
say?
You
know
what?
-
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
of
course.
Cool,
thanks.
Okay,
let's...
Right
here?
I
don't...
-
No,
we
can
do
it
in
the
kitchen.
Okay.
Okay.
Rob,
I
didn't
want
to
do
this
on
camera.
But,
I
just...
I
just
want
you
to
know
because
I
know
how
hard
and
I
know
how
much
it
means
And
I'm
really
gonna
miss
you.
Hey.
Can
I
talk
to
you
for
a
second?

Jason?
There's
something
totally
weird
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
Hud!
Not
now.
You
never
even
called
me,
Rob!
You
go
and
bring
some
guy
to
my
party?
Hold
on!
You
haven't
-
Hud,
man!
Come
on!
-
What?
What?
-
But
I'm
documenting!
Lily,
do
you
know
what
Lily,
if
you
know,
I'm
not
telling
you.
I
really
should
know,
She
was
the
one
-
Okay,
fine.
We'll
go
find
out.
-
We'll
ask
her.
We'll
go
find
out.
-
What?
Lil,
do
you
have
something
to
tell
us?
-
No.
-
What?
No.
-
You're
dodging
the
question
right
now.
-
Nothing.
Lily,
if
you
know
something,
-
No.
-
Lily.
Okay,
fine,
but
not
on
camera.
Okay,
that's
not
a
problem.
HUD:
Why
would
we
say
anything?
-
JASON:
We
won't
say
anything.
-
Are
you
serious?
Beth
made
me
promise
JASON:
Are
you
kidding
me,
Lily?
Rob
and
Beth
sleep
together,
-
HUD:
Why
wouldn't
you
tell
me?
Okay,
you
guys,
Rob
and
Beth
totally
had
sex
together.
-
I
knew
it.
No,
I'm
not
kidding.
Hey,
Marlena.
-
It's
me,
Hud,
from
before.
Did
you
know
-
No.
-
They've
been
friends
forever.
I
mean,
Rob's
been
in
love
Well,
maybe
it
was
like
Yeah.
Wait,
were
we
supposed
-
They
did.
They
had
sexual
intercourse.
-
Lily
told
me.
-
No,
you
are
so...
Why
do
you
make
up
stuff
like
that?
-
No,
I
do
not.
I
have
a
nice
car.
I
didn't
say
what
kind...
Hey.

-
Good
luck
in
Japan,
Rob.
HUD:
Hey,
dude.
Dude,
dude,
dude.
-
Hey.
Come
on.
-
What
is
it,
man?
-
We
should
talk
to
him.
I
could
talk
to
him
now.
Dude,
you
already
talked
LILY:
...
have
to
do
something.
JASON:
No.
-
and
give
him
space.
-
locked
in
his
room
all
night?
-
It's
fine,
trust
me.
-
It
is
fine.
You
are
his
best
friend.
HUD:
So,
how
do
you
wanna
do
this?
or
do
you
want
me
-
You're
not
doing
any
talking.
We
got
to
talk.
You
don't
know
-
all
right?
It
was
just
a
spur-of-the-moment
thing.
Yeah,
well,
Beth
told
Lori
-
you
totally
blew
her
off.
She
said
you
never
called
her.
Look,
I'm
leaving,
all
right?
I
don't
know,
man.
Look,
there's
no
"together.
"
It's
just
It's
better
if
we
just
stay
friends.
...not
that
I
feel
like
I'm
not
No,
stop,
stop!
You're
not
good
enough
for
her.
That's
it.
That's
fact.
That's
science.
Beth
Mclntyre
is,
like,
She's
beautiful.
She's
charming.
but
let's
face
it,
And
going
to
Japan
is
not
gonna
fix
that.
-
Like,
right
now,
as
you
are.
-
JASON:
But
you
got
to
go
after
her.
-
No,
it
is
that
simple,
Rob.
It's
about
moments,
man.
You
got
to
learn
to
say,
and
hang
on
to
the
people

HUD:
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.


HUD:
That
scared
the
shit
out
of
me.
JASON:
Lil!
Lil!
Did
you
feel
that?
-
HUD:
You
guys...
-
What
was
that?
-
JASON:
Hey.
Are
you
all
right?
-
Yeah,
that
was
really
scary.
Hey,
Marlena!
Marlena,
are
you
okay?
Guys,
look
out!
-
Okay.
JASON:
All
right,
here
we
go.
Wait.
Everyone
quiet
down.
All
right?
-
But
now,
just
approximately...
-
...
15
minutes
after
word...
...of
a
possible
earthquake
Nearby,
in
New
York
Harbour,
we're
in
the
middle
of
the
harbour
-
Once
again...
-
...
there's
no
way
to
know
if
any...
That's
true.
Do
you
think
-
I
don't
know.
Maybe.
Let's
go
see
if
we
can
see
Come
on,
Jason.
-
Yeah,
let's
go
up
there.
-
LILY:
No!
WOMAN:
What
do
you
think?
-
ROB:
It's
insane,
man.
It
was
shaking
everywhere,
man.
-
Yeah,
it's
on
the
news
downstairs.
-
MAN:
I
think
they
blew
up
the
trains.
-
Some
stayed
on.
Maybe
you
should've
left
town
Shut
up.

ROB:
Oh,
my
God!
No,
no,
no.
Go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,

JASON:
Hud.
Move.
Hud!




Oh,
God.
-
HUD:
Rob,

got
a
set
of
keys?
Right,
did
you
look
back?
-
Did
anybody
see
Jason
or
not?
HUD:
Did
anybody
see
Jason?
-
Did
anybody
see
Jason?

HUD:
Oh,

Oh,
Jesus
Christ!

Oh,
God!
Oh,
God!

Oh,
my
God!


MAN:
You
gotta
take
your
stuff
I'm
telling
you!
-
I'm
so
sorry.

Hey,
did
you
guys
see
that?

JASON:
Go!
Let's
go!
-
Hey,
get
down!
Get
down!
HUD:
Yeah,
did
you
guys
see
that?
-
Did
you
guys
see
that?
There
are
people
still
out
there.

HUD:
Rob!
Rob!
-
Rob.
-
Rob,
I
saw
it!
-
What's
he
saying?

JASON:

Stay
down,
Lily!

MAN:
He's
going
away
now.
-
ROB:
Jason,
what
are
you
doing?
Lily,
just
wait.

-
Jason,
don't
go
out...
Lily,
just
wait
here!

Hey,
Rob!

LILY:
Oh,
my
God.
Marlena?
Are
you
okay?
MAN:
It
walked
right
through
That's
what
I'm
trying
to
tell
you.
-
ROB:
What?
You
said
you
saw
something,
right?
-
You
said
it
was
alive?
What
was
it?
HUD:
I
don't
know,
man.
I
don't
know.
Hey,
you
guys!
I
have
it
on
tape!
-
ROB:
Well,
then
rewind
it.
Rewind
it.
It's
gonna
be
a
great
opportunity
for
you.
ROB:
Yeah,
but
I
don't
even
Oh,
come
