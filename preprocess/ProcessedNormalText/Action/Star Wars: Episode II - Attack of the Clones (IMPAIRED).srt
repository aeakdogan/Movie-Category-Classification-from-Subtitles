You

Well,

I

Can
you
tell

This

What
you

here
I
wonder
why
it

It's

No,
no.
It's

These,
uh,
Kaminoans
They're

-
Cloners.
Are
they

Depends
on
what,
Dex?
On
how
good
and
how
big

uh...

is.

Hmm.
Did

Yes,

I

Possession

Compassion,

you
might
say
that

You're

Reach

Hello.
I'm

I

I'm
looking

Mmm.

How

How
can
this

Hmm?
A

-
Anyone.
Because

That's
impossible,

Dangerous
and
disturbing

and
why,
Meditate
on
this
I
will.
Hmm.
I
wasn't
the

now
that
I
think
back
on

I'm
not
sure

heard

tried
I
was
relieved

I
agree
with

I'm
glad

I'm

Do
you
see
any
way
to
bring

Not
if
they
feel
threatened.
My
guess
is
they'll
turn
It's
outrageous,
but
after
four
trials
Nute
Gunray
is
still

I
fear
the

is
powerless
We
must
keep
our
faith
The

we
stop

Let's
pray
that

In
the

What
is
your
suggestion,
Oh,
Anakin's
He's

don't

No.
I
shouldn't

I'm

All
right,
I
get
the

Whatever
happened
to

I
went

-
Maybe
he
was
the
smart
one.
I
like
two
or
three...
but
I'm
not
really
sure

I
don't
think
How
would

We
need

That's
exactly
The

is

Well,
then

Who's

Of

Sounds
an

Well,

You're
making

Yep.

Sure.

very
impressive.
I'm
just
a
simple

Ever
made

Possibly.
Then
you
must

Uh,

Is
he
not

Never
heard
of

Really?
I
was
recruited
by

Do

I
look

They'll
do
their

well.
Thank
you

Always
a

What
is
it,

Pack
your

And
when
I
got
to

we
went
into

Uh,
well,
negotiations
-

Oh.
If

From
the

not

has
gone

now
that
I'm
in

The
closer
I
get
to

The

of

I'm
haunted
by
the
kiss
My
heart
is
beating...
hoping
that
that
kiss
You
are
in

tormenting
me.
What
can
I
do?
If
you
are
suffering
I
can't.
We
can't.
Anything
is
possible,
Padm.
No,
you
listen.
We
live
in
a
real
world.
You're
studying
to
become
a

If
you
follow
your

it'll
take

Then
you
do
feel
something.

No.

I
saw

She
is
suffering,
Padm.
I
saw
her
as
clearly

She
is
in
pain.
I
know
I'm
disobeying
my
mandate
but
I
have
to
go.
I
have
to
help
her.
I'll
go
with
you.
I'm
sorry.

way

over
on

like
to

Eh,
sure.
Absolutely!

Let's
go

think

must
have
put
Hang
on,

we'll
have
a
couple

He
doesn't

Oh,

Fire

Well,
we
won't

Well,
R4,
I
think
There's
an
unusual
concentration

Oh!
Um,
uh,
hello.
How
might
I
be
of
service?

3PO?
The
maker!
Oh,
Master
Ani!
I
knew

Hello,

Bless
my

I've
come
to

Hello.
I
guess
I
had
a
feeling

Is
my

We
should
go
inside.

It
was
just
before
dawn.
A
hunting
party
Your

had
gone
out
early,
to
pick
mushrooms
From
the
tracks,
when
they
took
her.

they're
vicious,
Thirty
of
us
went
out
after
her.
I'd
be
out
there
with
them,
I
just
couldn't
ride
anymore
I
don't
want
but
she's
been
gone
a
month.
There's
little
hope
Where
are
you
going?
To
find
my
mother.
Your
mother's
dead,
son.
You're
gonna
have
to
stay
here.
These
are
good
people,
Padm.
Anakin--
I
won't
be
long.


We
must
persuade
and
the
Corporate
Alliance
What
about
the
senator
Is
she
dead
yet?
I
am
not
signing
your
treaty


With

have

am

What
is
it?
Pain,
suffering...
death
I
feel.
Something
terrible

in

The

Maybe
we
can
contactAnakin

Static,

long-range--

-
Retransmit
this

to
Coruscant.
I
brought
you
something.
Are
you
hungry?
The
shifter
broke.
Life
seems
so
much
simpler
I'm
good
at
fixing

I
couldn't--
Why'd
she

Why
couldn't

save
her?
I
know
I

Sometimes
there
are
things

You're
not

Ani.
Someday
I
will
be.
I
will
be

promise
you.
I
will
even

It's
all
Obi-Wan's
fault!
He's
jealous!
He's
jealous!

What's
wrong,
Ani?
I--
I
killed
them.
I
killed
them
all.
They're
dead.
Every
single
one
of
them.
And
not
just
the
men...
but
the
women...
and
the
children
too.
They're
like
animals,
I
hate
them!

To
be
angry

know
I'm
better
than
this.

I
know

for
you

He
gave
you
strict
orders

I'm
going
to
help

-
If
you

not

Mm.

no,

will
create

counter

threats

Hmm.
