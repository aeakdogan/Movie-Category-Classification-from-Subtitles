Three
billion
human
lives
ended
on
August
29,
1997.
The
survivors
of
the
nuclear
fire
called
the
war
'Judgment
Day."
They
lived
only
to
face
a
new
nightmare
The
computer
which
controlled
the
machines,
Skynet,...
...sent
two
Terminator
back
through
time.
Their
mission:
to
destroy
the
leader
of
the
human
Resistance...
...John
Connor,
my
son.
The
first
Terminator
was
programmed
to
...before
John
was
born.
It
failed.
The
second
was
set
to
strike
at
John
himself
As
before,
the
resistance
was
able
to
send
a
lone
warrior,...
...a
protector
for
John.
It
was
just
a
question
of
which
one
Oh!
I
need
your
clothes,
your
boots
and
your
motorcycle.
You
forgot
to
say
"please."
Ooh!
Get
him
off
me!
Pull
it
out!
Pull
it
out!
Take
it.
Can't
let
you
take
the
man's
wheels,
son.
Now,
get
off
before
I
put
you
down.
That's
it,
goddamn
it.
R-31
David,
Sherman
Code
Six
...on
an
electrical
disturbance.
Ten-four,
R-31
David.
Come
on.
John?
John!
Your
foster
parents
are
kind
of
dicks,
huh?
I
swear,
I
have
had
it
with
that
goddamn
kid.
-
He
won't
even
answer
me
anymore.
Would
you
get
off
your
butt
and
help
me?
-
Todd!
He
hasn't
cleaned
that
room
of
his
in
a
month.
Well,
it's
an
emergency.
Come
on!
John!
Come
on.
Get
your
ass
inside.
She's
not
my
mother,
Todd.
Yeah-ha-ha!
This
next
patient
is
interesting.
-
A
29-year-old
female
diag...
...diagnosed
as
acute
schizo-affective
disorder.
The
usual
indicators:
depression,
anxiety,
The
delusional
architecture
is
fairly
unique.
She
believes
that
a
machine
called
the
Terminator,...
...which
looks
human
ofcourse,
-
That's
original.
...was
a
soldier
sent
back
to
protect
her.
-
No.
The
year,
uh,
2029,
if
I
remember
correctly.
And
here
we
are.
Morning,
Sarah.
Good
morning,
Dr.
Silberman.
Fine,
Sarah.
She,
uh,
stabbed
me
in
the
kneecap
Repeated
escape
attempts.
Let's
move
on,
shall
we?
Douglas,
I
don't
like
to
see
the
patients
-
See
that
she
takes
her
Thorazine.
Time
to
take
your
meds,
Connor.
You
take
it.
Now,
you
know
you
gotta
be
good
'cause
I'm
not
taking
it,
Dougie.
Ain't
no
trouble.
Yeah,
zap
her.
Last
call,
sugar.
Sweet
dreams.
Are
you
the
legal
guardian
of
John
Connor?
That's
right,
Officer.
-
Could
I
speak
with
him,
please?
He
took
off
on
his
bike
this
morning,
so
he
could
be
anywhere.
Do
you
have
a
photograph
of
John?
Yeah.
Sure.
Hold
on.
You
gonna
tell
me
what
this
is
about?
I
just
need
to
ask
him
a
few
questions.
He's
a
good-looking
boy.
No,
go
on.
Yeah,
a
big
guy
on
a
bike.
No.
I
wouldn't
worry
about
him.
Thanks
for
your
cooperation.
Please
insert
your
stolen
card
now.
PIN
number.
-
Will
you
hurry
up?
This
is
taking
too
long.
All
right.
-
Where'd
you
learn
this
stuff
from
anyway?
My
real
mom,
I
mean.
Come
on,
baby.
Come
on!
-
Yes!
All
right.
Easy
money.
-
Yes!
Piece
of
cake.
-
Is
that
her?
So
she's
pretty
cool,
huh?
No,
she's
a
complete
psycho.
That's
why
she's
up
at
Pescadero.
She
tried
to
blow
up
a
computer
factory,
No
shit.
She's
a
total
loser.
-
Come
on.
Let's
go
spend
some
money.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Wake
up.
Kyle.
-
You're
dead.
They
took
him
away
from
me.
-
He's
the
target
now.
-
He's
all
alone
and
you
have
to
protect
him.
You
tell
me
how
I'm
supposed
to
do
that.
He
doesn't
even
believe
me
anymore.
I've
lost
him.
You're
strong,
Sarah.
-
No.
I
love
you,
Sarah.
I
always
will.
I
need
you.
I'll
always
be
with
you.
Remember
the
message.
The
future
is
not
set.
There
is
no
fate
but
what
we
make
for
ourselves.
Stay
with
me.
There's
not
much
time
left
in
the
world,
Sarah.
Kyle,
don't
go!
Kyle!
Mommy,
watch
this!
Whoa!
It's
like
a
giant
strobe
light...
...burning
right
through
my
eyes.
Somehow
I
can
still
see.
Oh,
God.
We
know
the
dream's
the
same
every
night.
-
Why
do
I
have
to
--
Children
look
like
burnt
paper.
Black.
Not
moving.
And
then
the
blast
wave
hits
them.
And
they
fly
apart
like
leaves.
Dreams
of
cataclysm,
the
end
of
the
world,
are
very
common.
It's
not
a
dream,
you
moron.
-
I
know
the
date
it
happens.
On
August
29,
1997,
Anybody
not
wearing
two
million
sunblock
God,
you
think
you're
safe
and
alive.
You're
already
dead.
Everybody!
This
whole
place,
everything
you
see
is
gone!
You're
the
one
living
in
a
fucking
dream,
It
happens!
I
feel
much
better
now.
Clearer.
Yes,
your
attitude
has
been...
...much
improved
lately.
It's
helped
me
to
have
a
goal,
What
is
that?
Well,
you
said...
...that
if
I
showed
improvement
after
six
months,...
...you
would
transfer
me
to
the
minimum
security
wing
Well,
it's
been
six
months,
and...
...I
was
looking
forward
to
seeing
my
son.
I
see.
Let's
go
back
to
what
you
were
saying
Now
you
think
they
don't
exist?
They
don't
exist.
But
you've
told
me
on
many
occasions
If
I
had,
there
would
have
been
some
evidence.
They
would
have
found
something
at
the
factory.
I
see.
So
you
don't
believe
anymore
that
the
company
covered
it
up?
No.
Why
would
they?
Let's
try
a
new
position
right
there.
Those
neurons
are
all
saturated.
Mr.
Dyson?
Mr.
Dyson.
The
materials
team
is
running
another-
-
Mr.
Dyson.
The
materials
team
is
running
another
series
this
afternoon.
You
have
to
sign
for
the--
the,
uh--
it.
-
You
have
to
sign
it
out.
Listen,
Mr.
Dyson.
I
know
I
haven't
been
here
that
long,
-
Know
what?
You
know,
I
asked
them
that
very
same
question
once.
"Don't
ask."
-
Good
morning,
Mr.
Dyson.
Okay.
Insert
key.
-
How
are
the
wife
and
kids?
There
you
go.
So
what
do
you
think,
Doctor?
I
have
shown
improvement,
haven't
I?
Well,
Sarah,
here's
the
problem.
I
know
how
smart
you
are,
I
don't
think
you
really
believe
what
you're
telling
me
today.
I
think
if
I
put
you
in
minimum
security,
You
have
to
let
me
see
my
son.
Please.
Please.
He's
in
great
danger.
If
I
could
just
make
a
phone
call--
I'm
afraid
not.
I
don't
see
any
choice
but
to
recommend
to
the
review
board
-
I'll
kill
you,
you
son
of
a
bitch!
-
Douglas!
Douglas!
Get
her
off!
You
don't
know
what
you're
doing!
Get
some
restraints
in
here
now!
-
You
don't
know
what
you're
doing!
God!
Model
citizen.
Bam
You
just
missed
him.
-
I
think
he
said
he
was
going
to
the
galleria,
right?
The
galleria?
-
I've
never
seen
him.
-
Hey,
bro,
I'm
gonna
get
some
quarters.
I'll
be
back,
all
right?
-
Oh,
no!
No.
-
Oh!
Nah,
I
don't
know
him.
-
John.
Hey.
Man,
there's
this
cop
scoping
for
you.
-
Yeah.
He's
right
over
there.
Yeah.
Hey,
man,
I
think
I
saw
that
kid
you
were
looking--
Hey!
You're
not
supposed
to
be
in
here!
Hey!
Hey!
Get
down.
Hey,
mister,
are
you
all
right?
Mister,
you
all
right?
Come
on!
Come
on!
Shit.
Damn!
Okay,
time-out.
Time-out.
Holy
shit.
Now,
don't
take
this
the
wrong
way,
Yes.
Cyberdyne
Systems,
Model
101.
No.
Ho--
Holy
shit.
You're
really
real.
I
mean--
You--
You're
like
a
machine
underneath,
right?
But
sort
of
alive
outside?
I'm
a
cybernetic
organism.
This
is
intense.
Get
a
grip,John.
Okay.
Um--
You're
not
here
to
kill
me.
I
figured
that
part
out
for
myself.
-
So
what's
the
deal?
Yeah?
Who
sent
you?
You
did.
Thirty-five
years
from
now,
you
reprogrammed
me...
...to
be
your
protector
here,
in
this
time.
Oh,
this
is
deep.
So
this
other
guy,
he's
a
Terminator
like
you,
right?
Not
like
me.
-
You
mean,
more
advanced
than
you
are?
-
What
the
hell
does
that
mean?
Where
are
we
going?
We
have
to
get
out
of
the
Listen.
I
gotta
stop
by
my
house.
Negative.
-
You
sure?
Look,
Todd
and
Janelle
are
dicks,...
...but
I
gotta
warn
'em.
Shit.
You
got
a
quarter?
-
Hello.
-
John?
-
Are
you
guys
okay?
-
Are
you
all
right?
John,
it's
late.
If
you
hurry
home,
we
can
sit
down
and
have
dinner
together.
-
I'm
making
beefstew.
John?
Where
are
you?
What
the
hell
is
the
goddamn
dog
barking
at?
Hey!
The
dog's
really
barking.
I
thought
you
were
gonna
tell
the
John,
honey,
it's
late.
Could
he
already
be
there?
-
Honey,
are
you
okay?
Are
you
sure?
-
What's
the
dog's
name?
Hey,Janelle.
I
can
hear
him
barking.
Wolfie's
fine,
honey.
Where
are
you?
Your
foster
parents
are
dead.
Oh.
I
need
a
minute
here.
You're
telling
me
that
this
thing
Anything
it
samples
by
physical
contact.
Get
real.
No,
only
an
object
of
equal
size.
Why
not
just
become
a
bomb
or
something
to
get
me?
It
can't
form
complex
machines.
Guns
and
explosives
have
chemicals,
moving
parts.
It
doesn't
work
that
way.
-
Like
what?
Messages
from
Mom.
These
were
taken
by
a
video
surveillance
camera...
...at
the
West
Highland
Police
Station
in
1984.
He
killed
17
police
officers
that
night.
Men
with
families,
children.
These
were
taken
at
a
mall
in
Reseda
today.
Miss
Connor,
we
know
you
know
who
this
guy
is.
Look,
I
just
sat
here
and
told
you
that
your
son
is
missing,...
...that
the
foster
parents
have
been
murdered.
We
know
this
guy's
involved.
Doesn't
that
mean
anything
to
you?
We're
wasting
our
time.
-
Let's
go.
She's
just
grown
more
and
more
I'm
afraid
she
can't
help
us
now.
If
she
clears
at
all
and
can
give
us
anything,
Sure.
-
Douglas,
take
her
back
to
her
room,
please.
Come
on,
sweetheart.
You
see,
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
Nicaragua
For
a
while
there,
she
was
with
this
crazy
ex-Green
Beret
guy...
...running
guns.
Then
there
were
some
other
guys.
She'd
shack
up
with
anybody
she
could
learn
from
so
Then
she
gets
busted.
It's
like,
"Sorry,
kid,
your
mom's
a
psycho.
It's
like
everything
I've
been
brought
up
I
hated
her
for
that.
But
everything
she
said
was
true.
She
knew,...
...and
nobody
believed
her,...
...not
even
me.
Listen.
Negative.
...to
copy
Sarah
Connor
and
to
wait
for
you
to
make
contact
with
her.
Great.
What
happens
to
her?
Typically,
the
subject
being
copied
is
terminated.
Shit!
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
Negative.
Yeah?
Well,
fuck
youself!
Hey,
goddamn
it!
-
Help!
Help!
Get
this
psycho
off
of
me!
-
Help!
I'm
being
kidnapped!
Get
this
psycho
off
of
me!
Let
me
go!
Why
the
hell
did
you
do
that?
Because
you
told
me
to.
What?
You
have
to
do
what
I
say,
huh?
That's
one
of
my
mission
parameters.
Prove
it.
Stand
on
one
foot.
Yes!
Cool.
My
own
Terminator.
Wow.
You
okay,
kid?
-
Take
a
hike,
bozo.
What?
Fuckyou,
you
little
dipshit!
Dipshit?
Put
your
leg
down.
Did
you
call
moi
a
dipshit?
Just
trying
to
help
this
punk.
Grab
this
guy.
Get
him
off
of
me!
Now
who's
the
dipshit,
you
jock
douche
bag?
Get
off
of
him!
-
No!
Put
the
gun
down
now!
-
Get
outta
here!
Jesus!
Ofcourse.
I'm
a
Terminator.
Listen
to
me
very
carefully,
okay?
You're
not
a
Terminator
anymore,
all
right?
You
got
that?
-
You
just
can't
go
around
killing
people.
What
do
you
mean,
why?
-
Why?
Look.
I'm
gonna
go
get
my
mom,...
...and
I
order
you
to
help
me.
Hmph.
Hi.
You
have
a
Sarah
Connor
here?
You're
runnin'
kind
of
late,
aren't
ya?
They've
been
in
there
for
an
hour.
Hold
on
a
second.
Oh,
here
comes
your
friends
now.
-
Hey,
Gwen,
you
want
some
coffee?
-
How
'bout
a
beer?
-
Hey,
I
got
a
full
house.
Must
be
my
lucky
day.
Shut
up!
Yeah,
I
think
you're
right
about
number
24.
Increase
the
medication
to
250
milligrams.
-
Same
time?
You!
You
broke
my
arm.
There
are
215
bones
in
the
human
body.
-
That's
one.
Now,
don't
move.
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Why
do
we
stop
now?
Now,
you
gotta
promise
me
you're
not
gonna
kill
anyone,
right?
-
Right.
What?
Just
put
up
your
hand
and
say,
"I
swear
I
won't
kill
anyone."
I
swear
I
will
not
kill
anyone.
All
right.
Let's
go.
Visiting
hours
is
10:00
to
4:00,
Monday
through
Friday.
-
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Crazy
bastard!
Oh,
God!
Don't
shoot
me
again.
Oh,
my
leg.
He'll
live.
Son
of
a
bitch!
-
Let's
all
try
to
remain
calm.
There's
no
way,
Connor.
-
Open
the
door.
Take
it
easy,
Sarah.
Easy.
It
won't
work,
Sarah.
You're
no
killer.
You're
already
dead,
Silberman.
Everybody
dies.
Open
the
door.
Open
it.
Back
off!
Get
back!
-
I'll
pump
him
full
of
this
shit.
I
swear!
Don't
move!
-
Drop
the
shit!
Get
in
the
office.
On
the
floor,
face
down.
Open
the
door.
On
the
floor.
Hold
it
open.
Get
her.
Get
her!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Hurry
up!
Open
the
door!
Let's
go!
Come
on!
Open
it!
-
Let's
go,
let's
go!
-
She
broke
it
off.
Let's
go
around!
Come
on!
No!
No!
-
No!
Mom!
-
Come
back
here!
No!
No!
-
Help
her!
-
Hurry
up!
Hurry
up!
-
He'll
kill
us
all!
He'll
kill
us
all!
Mom,
are
you
okay?
Mom!
Come
with
me
if
you
want
to
live.
It's
okay,
Mom.
Go.
What
the
fuck
is
it?
Get
down.
Mom!
Out
of
the
car!
Right
now!
Go!
I'm
out.
-
Come
on.
Reload.
Last
one!
Hang
on.
Ready!
John!
Here,
drive.
He's
not
back
there.
-
Are
you
all
right?
-
Can
you
even
see
anything?
Cool.
Come
here.
I
said
I
was
okay!
John,
it
was
stupid
of
you
to
go
there.
Goddamn
it.
You
almost
got
yourself
killed.
What
were
you
thinking?
You
cannot
risk
yourself,
even
for
me.
Do
you
understand?
Do
you
understand?
But
I
had
to
get
you
out
of
that
place.
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
need
your
help.
What's
wrong
with
your
eyes?
Nothin'.
So,
what's
your
story?
-
You
okay?
Say,
that's
a
nice
bike.
Hey!
Watch
it,
lug
nuts.
Listen.
I
have
detailed
files
on
human
anatomy.
I
bet.
-
Makes
you
a
more
efficient
killer,
right?
Does
it
hurt
when
you
get
shot?
I
sense
injuries.
-
John,
help
me
with
the
light.
-
Yes.
If
you
can't
pass
for
human,
you're
not
much
good
to
us.
-
How
long
do
you
live?
A
hundred
and
twenty
years,
with
my
existing
power
cell.
Can
you
learn
stuff
that
you
haven't
...you
know,
more
human...
...and
not
such
a
dork
all
the
time?
My
C.P.U.
is
a
neural
net
processor,
a
learning
computer,...
...but
Skynet
presets
the
switch
to
read
-
Doesn't
want
you
to
do
too
much
thinking,
huh?
Can
we
reset
the
switch?
Rotate
the
two
locking
cylinders
counter
clockwise.
Do
it.
Now
open
the
port
cover.
Pull,
to
break
the
seal.
Good.
Now
remove
the
shock-damping
assembly.
You
can
now
access
the
C.P.U.
-
Do
you
see
it?
Pull
the
C.P.U.
beds
base
tab.
Pull.
Can
you
see
the
pin
switch?
No,
no!
-
Out
of
my
way,
John.
"It,"
John,
not
"him."
"It."
Okay.
"It."
Listen
to
me.
You
listen.
We
are
better
off
on
our
own.
But
he's
the
only
proof
we
have
Maybe.
I
don't
trust
it.
But
he's
my
friend,
all
right?
You
don't
know
what
it's
like
And
if
something
goes
wrong,
Look,
Mom.
...maybe
you
should
start
listening
to
Cause
if
my
own
mother
won't,
how
do
you
expect
anyone
else
to?
All
right.
Play
it
your
way.
Was
there
a
problem?
No
problem.
None
whatsoever.
Are
we
learning
yet?
Hey!
We
have
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
city
as
possible.
Just
head
south.
Keep
it
under
65.
-
We
don't
want
to
be
pulled
over.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You
gotta
listen
to
the
way
people
talk.
You
don't
say
"affirmative"
or
some
shit
like
that.
You
say,
"No
problemo."
And
if
someone
comes
off
to
you
with
an
attitude,
And
if
you
want
to
shine
them
on,
Hasta
la
vista,
baby.
Yeah,
or
"Later,
dick-wad."
And
if
someone
gets
upset,
you
say,
"Chill
out."
Or
you
could
do
combinations.
Chill
out,
dick-wad.
That's
great!
No
problemo.
You
got
any
cash?
I
got
a
couple
hundred
bucks.
-
Mom!
-
Get
some
food.
No
sense
of
humor.
And
that's
another
thing.
You
can
lighten
up
a
bit
yourself.
This
severe
routine
is
getting
old,
okay?
I
mean,
you're
acting
like
such
a
geek.
-
Smile
once
in
a
while.
Yeah.
You
know,
smile.
Watch.
Hi.
Nice
place
you
got
here.
Give
me
a
break.
Okay.
Bad
example.
See
that
guy
over
there?
You're
crazy.
That's
good.
Want
some
of
my
fries?
-
Need
any
help?
-
I
got
you!
I
got
you!
No,
you
didn't!
I
told
you
I'm--
We're
not
gonna
make
it,
are
we?
People,
I
mean.
It's
in
your
nature
to
destroy
yourselves.
Yeah.
Major
drag,
huh?
Break
it
up
before
I
wring
both
of
your
necks.
Come
on.
I
need
to
know
how
Skynet
gets
built.
-
Who's
responsible?
Who
is
that?
He's
the
director
of
special
projects
Why
him?
In
a
few
months
he
creates
a
Go
on.
Then
what?
In
three
years
Cyberdyne
will
become
the
All
stealth
bombers
are
upgraded
with
Cyberdyne
computers,
Afterwards
they
fly
with
a
perfect
operational
record.
The
SKYnet
funding
bill
is
passed.
The
system
goes
online
on
August
4,
1997.
Human
decisions
are
removed
from
strategic
defense.
Skynet
begins
to
learn
at
a
geometric
rate.
It
becomes
self-aware
at
2:14
a.m.
In
a
panic
they
try
to
pull
the
plug.
-
SKYnet
fights
back.
It
launches
its
missiles
against
the
targets
in
Russia.
Why
attack
Russia?
Because
Skynet
knows
that
the
Russian
Jesus.
How
much
do
you
know
about
Dyson?
I
have
detailed
files.
I
want
to
know
everything.
What
he
looks
like,
where
he
lives,
everything.
Miles?
Miles.
Oh!
-
Hey.
You
gonna
work
all
day?
I'm
sorry,
baby,
but
this
thing
is
just
kicking
my
ass.
Miles,
it's
Sunday.
I
can't.
Um--
I'm
on
a
roll.
Baby,
this
is
gonna
blow
'em
all
away.
-
It's
a--
It's
a
neural
net
processor
It's
a
neural
net
processor.
It's
superconducting
at
room
temperature.
-
Other
computers
are
just
pocket
calculators
by
comparison.
But
why
is
that
so
goddamn
important,
Miles?
I
really
need
to
know,
Baby,
I
am
this
close.
Come
here.
Imagine
a--
a
jet
airliner...
...with
a
pilot
that
never
gets
tired,
never
makes
mistakes,
Meet
the
pilot.
Why
did
we
get
married,
Miles?
Your
heart
and
your
mind
are
in
here.
But
it
doesn't
love
you
like
we
do.
I'm
sorry.
Really.
How
'bout
spending
some
time
with
your
other
babies?
Hey-hey!
-
Raging
Wateb!
Wait
in
the
car.
Enrique,
estas
aqui?
You're
pretty
jumpy,
Connor.
Y
t.
Siempre
como
culebra.
-
Hey!
Que
bueno
verte,
Connor.
Y
yo
lo
sabia,
carajo.
Que
bueno
verte.
Yolanda,
venga,
que
hay
visita,
carajo.
-
Hey,
big
John,
como
te
va?
Que
grandote
es
este?
He's
cool,
Enrique.
He's
with
me.
-
Uncle
Bob,
this
is
Enrique.
Okay.
Okay.
-
Que
bonito!
-
Como
estas?
Que
grande
estas,
mi
hijito?
"Uncle
Bob"?
Eh,
Sarita.
You're
pretty
famous,
you
know,
all
over
the
goddamn
TV.
Pictures
of
you,
John,
your
big
friend
here.
Cops
are
going
nuts
looking
for
you.
Mihijita,
llevese
el
nino,
eh.
I
just
came
for
my
stuff.
-
How
about
the
fillings
out
of
my
fucking
teeth?
-
You
two,
you're
on
weapons
detail.
One
thing
about
my
mom...
...she
always
plans
ahead.
Excellent.
Aw,
shit.
You
know,
this
is
the
best
truck
I
got,
but
the
starter
motor's
gone.
You
got
the
time
to
change
it
out?
-
Yeah.
I'm
gonna
wait
till
dark
to
cross
the
border.
Enrique,
it's
dangerous
for
you
here.
-
You
get
out
tonight
too.
Okay?
Just
drop
by
any
time
and
totally
fuck
up
my
life,
all
right?
See,
I
grew
up
in
places
like
this,...
...so
I
just
thought
that's
how
people
lived...
...riding
around
in
helicopters,...
...learning
how
to
blow
shit
up.
But
then
when
my
mom
got
busted
I
got
put
in
a
regular
school.
All
the
other
kids
were
into
Nintendo.
-
Are
you
ever
afraid?
-
Not
even
of
dying?
You
don't
feel
any
emotion
about
it
one
way
or
another?
No.
I
have
to
stay
functional
until
my
mission
is
complete.
Then
it
doesn't
matter.
Yeah.
I
have
to
stay
functional
too.
That's
definitely
you.
Most
of
the
guys
my
mom
hung
around
with
were
geeks,...
...but
there
was
this
one
guy,
he
was
kinda
cool.
He
taught
me
engines.
Hold
here.
Mom
screwed
it
up,
ofcourse.
She'd
always
tell
'em
about
Judgment
Day
and
me
being
this
world
leader.
That'd
be
all
she
wrote.
Torque
wrench,
please.
Here.
I
wish
I
could've
met
my
real
dad.
You
will.
Yeah,
I
guess.
When
I'm,
like,
45,
I
think.
They
sent
him
back
through
time
to
1984.
Man.
He
hasn't
even
been
born
yet.
It
messes
with
your
head.
-
The
other
bolt.
Mom
and
him
were
only
together
for
one
night.
She
still
loves
him,
I
guess.
I
see
her
crying
sometimes.
She
denies
it
totally,
ofcourse,
Why
do
you
cry?
-
You
mean
people?
I
don't
know.
We
just
cry,
you
know,
when
it
hurts.
Pain
causes
it?
Uh,
no.
It's
when
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you,
but
you
hurt
anyways.
-
You
get
it?
All
right,
my
man!
No
problemo.
Give
me
five.
Just
put
out
your
hand
like
this.
All
right!
Now
hit
me.
Give
me
five.
All
right--
Okay,
that's
good,
that's
good.
Too
slow.
No.
I'm
just
kidding.
Good.
Now
try
it.
Now
do
me.
Watching
John
with
the
machine,
it
was
suddenly
so
clear.
The
Terminator
would
never
stop.
It
would
never
leave
him
and
it
would
never
hurt
him,...
...never
shout
at
him
or
get
drunk
and
hit
him...
...or
say
it
was
too
busy
to
spend
time
with
him.
It
would
always
be
there...
...and
it
would
die
to
protect
him.
Of
all
the
would-be
fathers
who
came
and
went
over
the
years,...
...this
thing,
this
machine
was
the
only
one
who
measured
up.
In
an
insane
world,
it
was
the
sanest
choice.
Hey,
let's
try
this
one.
Hey!
Here
we
go.
She
said
you
go
south
with
him
like
you
planned.
-
She'll
meet
you
tomorrow
on
the
other
side.
Mom!
Mom,
wait!
"No
fate."
No
fate
but
what
we
make.
My
father
told
her
this.
I
mean,
Never
mind.
Now--
The
future's
not
set.
There's
no
fate
but
what
we
make
for
ourselves.
She
intends
to
change
the
future.
Yeah,
I
guess.
Oh,
shit!
-
Dyson.
Gotta
be.
Miles
Dyson.
She's
gonna
blow
him
away!
Come
on!
Let's
go!
Come
on!
-
This
is
tactically
dangerous.
The
T-1000
has
the
same
files
that
I
do.
It
knows
what
I
know.
I
don't
care.
Killing
Dyson
might
actually
prevent
the
war.
I
don't
care!
Haven't
you
figured
out
why
you
can't
kill
people?
Look,
maybe
you
don't
care
if
you
live
or
die,
We
have
feelings.
You
gotta
learn
this
stuff.
Danny?
Just
a
couple
of
minutes,
Mom!
Danny,
your
time
is
up!
Come
brush
your
teeth
and
get
to
bed.
Danny!
Daddy!
Danny,just
go!
Go!
-
Miles?
-
Miles?
Oh,
my
God!
Tarissa,just
take
Danny
and
go!
Oh,Jesus!
Miles!
Aah!
-
Daddy!
Danny!
-
Don't
hurt
my
daddy!
-
Get
down
now!
Get
out
of
the
way!
Don't
hurt
him!
Get
on
the
floor!
Come
on.
Come
on.
Just-Just
let
the
boy
go.
Shut
up.
Shut
up.
It's
all
your
fault,
motherfucker.
-
It's
all
your
fault!
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
do
it.
Shh.
Shit!
We're
too
late!
Check
them.
O-Oh,
God.
Look
at
me,
Mom.
Are
you
hurt?
Look
at
me.
I
almost--
I
almost--
It'll
be
okay,
Mom.
We'll
figure
something
out.
I
promise.
You
came
here
to
stop
me.
Yeah,
I
did.
I
love
you,John.
I
always
have.
I
know.
Deep
penetration.
No
shattered
bone.
The
pressure
should
stop
the
bleeding.
-
Who
are
you
people?
Danny,
I
want
you
to
come
with
me
right
now.
Oh--
Oh,
God!
Oh!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God.
Now
listen
to
me
very
carefully.
Nuclear
winter
effects
caused
massive
cooling.
Dyson
listened
while
the
Terminator
laid
it
all
down.
Skynet.
Judgment
Day.
The
history
of
things
to
come.
It's
not
every
day
that
you
find
out
He
took
it
pretty
well.
I
feel
like
I'm
gonna
throw
up.
You're
judging
me
on
things
I
haven't
even
done
yet.
How
were
we
supposed
to
know?
Yeah.
Right.
How
were
you
supposed
to
know?
Fucking
men
like
you
built
the
hydrogen
bomb.
Men
like
you
thought
it
up.
You
think
you're
so
creative.
You
don't
know
what
it's
like
to
really
create
something,...
...to
create
a
life,
to
feel
it
growing
inside
you.
-
All
you
know
how
to
create
is
death
and
destruction.
We
need
to
be
a
little
more
constructive
here.
-
We
still
have
to
stop
this
from
happening,
don't
we?
Aren't
we
changing
things,
I
mean
right
now,
That's
right.
Forget
it.
I'm
out
of
it.
That's
not
good
enough.
-
No
one
must
follow
your
work.
All
right,
then,
uh,
...the
files,
the
disk
drives,
everything,
everything
here.
Everything.
I
don't
care.
The
chip.
-
What
chip?
-
It
must
be
from
the
other
one
like
you.
Son
of
a
bitch!
-
They
told
us
not
to
ask
where
they
got
it.
It
was
scary
stuff.
I
mean
it
was
smashed,
it
didn't
work
but
it
gave
us
ideas,
I
mean,
things
we
would've
never
th--
All
my
work
was
based
on
it.
It
must
be
destroyed.
Right.
Can
you
get
us
in?
I
think
so,
yeah.
When?
Now?
The
future,
always
so
clear
to
me,...
...had
become
like
a
black
highway
at
night.
We
were
in
uncharted
territory
now,...
...making
up
history
as
we
went
along.
Hi.
Uh,
Carl,
right?
Uh,
friends
from
out
of
town.
Hi.
take
'em
upstairs
and
show
'em
around.
Mr.
Dyson,
now
you
know
the
rules
concerning
visitors
in
the
lab.
I
insist.
Don't
even
think
about
it.
Come
on.
It's
okay.
It
takes
two
keys
to
open
the
vault.
The
other
one
is
in
a
locker
at
the
security
station.
Gibbons?
Gibbons!
Come
on,
man!
Shit.
Gibbons.
Oh,
shit.
Okay.
My
card
should
access
this.
I--
What?
-
What
is
it?
The
silent
alarm's
been
tripped.
It's
neutralized
all
the
codes
in
the
entire
building.
Nothing
will
open
anywhere
now.
We
have
to
abort.
No.
We
go
all
the
way.
Okay.
You
guys
get
started
on
the
lab.
-
I
think
it's
that
guy
from
the
mall.
Yeah.
Look
just
send
everything
you
got
in
the
area
right
now.
I
have
a
personal
entry
code
for
the
lab.
It's
no
good.
Let
me
try
mine.
John,
fire
in
the
hole!
Wait!
You
can't
go
in
there.
You
have
to
wait
a
few
minutes
until
the
gas
clears.
Put
this
on.
All
right,
let's
get
to
work.

...a
211
in
progress
at
2144
Kramer
Street,
Suspect
one
is
white
female
identified
as
last
name
Connor,
Escaped
last
night
from
Pescadero
State

Suspect
one:
White
male-
All
the
discs
in
my
office,
...everything
behind
my
desk
and
all
the
processors
on
my
left.
We'll
blow
those
with
the
C-4.
Can
I,
um--
Excuse
me.
Can
I
borrow
that
thing?
I
worked
a
lot
of
years
on
this
thing.
1-Mary-3,
give
me
that
location
again.

2111
Kramer.
Sending
the
SWAT
team.
All
right.
7-2-5-6.
Easy
money.
Uh-oh.
Oh,
shit.
Not
good.
How
we
doing?
Primer
cord
is
set.
One
more
barrel,
two
more
minutes.
How
do
we,
how
do
we
set
them
off?
Remote
control.
Piece
of
cake.
-
We
got
company.
-
How
many?
Go.
I'll
finish
here.
Come
on.
-
I'll
take
care
of
the
police.
Trust
me.
You
at
the
window!
Drop
your
weapons
and
place
your
hands
on
top
of
your
head!
Holy
shit!
That's
a
damn
mini-gun!
-
Come
on!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Son
of
a
bitch!
Go,
go!
Go!
Go!
Fire!
Here
we
go.
One,
two,
three,
go.
All
right,
now,
in
order
to
get
that

Hold

Ready

Time

I

longer
I

hold
this.
Fall

Everybody

Fall

We

a
war
zone
down

Shut

eyes.
Stay

I'll
be
back.
Get

on
the
floor!
Get

Okay,

Here,

this.
Give

a
hand!
Holy

Go!
Shit!
Get

Listen,
no
matter
what
happens,

under
these
vests.

You

it?
All
right.
-
Chopper's
coming
in!
Shit!
John!
Stay
down!
Mom!
Hello?
Aw,
damn!
You

right?
Come

gotta
get
out.
-
Take
the
shotgun.
Are
you
hurt?
Holy
shit.
Come
on,
Mom.
-
We
need
your
truck.
-
Come
on.
Hurry.
Come
on!
Go!
What
the
hell--
-
I'm
bleeding
bad.
Here.
This'll
work.
He's
gaining.
-
Step
on
it!
I
can
get
out
and
run
faster
than
this!
He's
coming
up,
to
the
right.
Watch
it!
Watch
it!
-
Drive
a
minute.
Take
the
off-ramp.
Shit!
Hold
on!
Don't
stop!
Go
straight!
-
Look
out!
Get
the
hell
outta
here!
Get
outta
here!
Come

Let's
go!
Hasta

We
don't
have
much
time.
Let's
go.
Come

Come

Hand
me
the
shotgun.
Put
your
weight
on
me,
Mom.
Hurry!
Come
on,
Mom.
Come

Mom!
Get
up!
Get

Come

This
way.
Come
on.
All
right.
No!
Wait!
Wait.
No.
No.
-
Go.
Run.
-
John.
-
John!
No!
Gotta
get
up
the
steps.
Go
on.
Get
up.
Come
on,
Mom.
No.
Grab
the
chain.
Grab
it.
Grab
it.
Go.
Go!
Mom,
come
on!
Mom!
Mom!
Come
on!
Mom!
Mom,
come
on!
Mom!
Call
to
John.
No.
I
know
this
hurts.
Call
John.
Call
to
John
now.
Fuckyou.
John!
John?
Help!
John.
John?
John.
John.
John.
-
Mom.
Help

-
Help
me.
-
John.
John.
Mom!
Get
down!
Get
up.
Come
on.
Holy
shit.
I
need
a
vacation.
Is
it
dead?
Terminated.
Will
this
melt
in
there?
Yes.
Throw
it
in.
Adios.
And
the
chip.
It's
over.
No.
There's
one
more
chip.
And
it
must
be
destroyed
also.
Here.
I
cannot
self-terminate.
No.
No.
-
I'm
sorry,
John.
I'm
sorry.
No,
it'll
be
okay.
I
have
to
go
away.
No,
don't
do
it.
-
I
must
go
away,
John.
No,
wait.
-
Wait.
You
don't
have
to
do
this.
No,
don't
do
it!
It
has
to
end
here.
I
order
you
not
to
go.
I
order
you
not
to
go!
I
know
now
why
you
cry.
But
it's
something
I
can
never
do.
Good-bye.
August
29,
1997,
came
and
went.
Nothing
much
happened.
There
was
no
Judgment
Day.
People
went
to
work
as
they
always
do.
Laughed,
complained,
watched
TV,
made
love.
I
wanted
to
run
through
the
street
yelling,...
...to
grab
them
all
and
say,
Use
it
well."
Instead,
I
got
drunk.
But
the
dark
future
which
never
came
still
exists
for
me.
And
it
always
will,
like
the
traces
of
a
dream.
John
fights
the
war
differently
than
it
was
foretold.
Here,
on
the
battlefield
of
the
Senate,...
...his
weapons
are
common
sense
and
hope.
Tie
me,
Grandma.
Tie
me!
-
How's
that?
The
luxury
of
hope
was
given
to
me
by
the
Terminator.
Because
if
a
machine
can
learn
the
value
of
human
life,...
...maybe
we
can
too.
