you
saw
me?
I
saw
you
in
some
magazine
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about?
-
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Dude,
that
whole

What?
You
got
a

Uh...
That's
a

Unh.
No,
I
don't.
Yeah.

When
did
you
do

There's
something
Every
time
I
mention
my

I
know
you're
not
telling
me
something.

I
don't
lie.
Aunt

You
have
to
tell

That's
my

Yes,
he
was
your
father.
But
that
didn't
seem
to
here.
I
need
the

The
truth
is,
your

You
were
this
little

was
turned
upside
down
We
did
the
best
we
could,
I
mean,
who
else
was
gonna
care
for
you,
Your

No.
I
was
the

who
wiped

No.
No,
I
won't

You're
my

As

I'm

And
I

I'm

You're

I'll

But
it

Okay.

A
few
days
after

men
came
to
see
us.
They
said
the

research
that
your
father
was
doing
with
and
that

And
that's
why
he
ran
off
with
it.
They
said
he
was
a
traitor.
I
couldn't
believe
it,
Peter.
They
told
us
he
betrayed
for
the
money.
I
don't...
Oh,
I
don't
get
it.
No,
I
don't...
Yes,

can't
make

it
could
do
something
worse.

this
city
will
never

that.
Speaking
of
progress,
you're
looking
better.
It

HARRY:
FIERS:
Aleksei
Sytsevich.
Currently
serving
a

sentence.
He
is
most
eager
to
join
us.
HARRY:
Good.
Start
with
him.
NEWSCASTER

broken
out
of
known
simply
as
the
Vault
It's
yet
another
example
since
the
disappearance
The
web-slinger's
absence
has
left
Believe
it
or
not,
even
the
New
has
joined
the
chorus
for
the
return
The
entire
world
seems
to
be
Where
is
Spider-Man?

Oh.
Too
bad
about
that
spider
guy.
Too
bad
he's
disappeared.
Seems
Where
you
going?
-
Eat
my
cereal.
Where
you
going?

I
don't
know.

You
know,
it's
so
funny.
I've

And
it's
so
funny,
the
heavier
-
You're
throwing
his
stuff
away?
No.
God,
no.
I
couldn't
do
that.
I'm
just
finding
a
better
place
for
it.
I'm
gonna
take
one
last
look,
and
I'm
gonna

GWEN
:
It's
easy
to
feel
But
there
will
be
dark
days
There
will
be
days
And
that's
when
hope
No
matter
how
buried
it
gets,
or
how
lost
you
feel,
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
hold
on
to
hope.
Keep
it
alive.
We
have
to
be
greater
My
wish
for
you
is
to
become
hope.
People
need
that.
And
even
if
we
fail,
what
better
way
is
there
to
live?
As
we
look
around
here
today
at
all
of
the
people
I
know
it
feels
like
But
we
will
carry
into
everything
that
we
do
next,
to
remind
us
of
who
we
are,
and
of
who
we're
meant
to
be.

I've
had
a
great
I'll
miss
you
all
very
much.
