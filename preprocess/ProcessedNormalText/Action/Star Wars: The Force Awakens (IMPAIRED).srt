And
you
could
use
a
co-pilot.

Watch
the
thrust.
We're
going
From
inside
the
hangar?
I
never
ask
that
question
-

This
is
not
how
I
thought
Angle
the
shield.
Hang
on
back
there.
No
problem!
Come
on,
baby,
don't
let
me
down.
-
What?


Inform
the
First
Order...
that
Han
Solo
has
the
droid
they
want.
And
it's
aboard
the
Millennium
Falcon.

SNOKE:
The
droid
will
soon
be
leading
them
to
the
last
Jedi.
If
Skywalker
returns...
the
new
Jedi
will
rise.
Supreme
Leader,
General!
Our
strategy
must
now
change.
The
weapon.
It
is
ready.
I
believe
the
time
has
come
to
use
it.
We
shall
destroy
the
government...
that
supports
the
Resistance...
the
Republic.
Without
their
friends
to
protect
them...
the
Resistance
will
be
vulnerable.
And
we
will
stop
them
Go.
Oversee
preparations.
Yes,
Supreme
Leader.
SNOKE:
There
has
been
an
awakening.
Have
you
felt
it?
KYLO
REN:
Yes.
There's
something
more.
The
droid
we
seek
is
aboard
In
the
hands
of
your
father...
Han
Solo.
He
means
nothing
to
me.
Even
you,
master
of
the
have
never
faced
such
a
test.
By
the
grace
of
your
training,
We
shall
see.
We
shall
see.

-
Electrical
overload.
Coolant's
leaking.

Try
transferring
auxiliary
power...
BOTH:...to
the
secondary
tank.
-
I
got
it.
FINN:
Chewie,
come
on!
I
need
help
with
this
giant
hairy
thing!
-
Stop
moving!
-

-
FINN:
Chewie!
You
hurt
Chewie,
Hurt
him?
He
almost
killed
me
six
times!

Which
is
fine!
This
hyperdrive
blows,
pieces
of
us
in
three
different
systems.

What'd
you
do?
I
bypassed
the
compressor.
Huh.
Move,
ball.

Ah,
don't
say
that.
You
did
great.
Just
rest.
Good
job,
kid.
Thanks.
-
You're
welcome.

HAN:
So...
fugitives,
huh?
REY:
The
First
Order
wants
the
map.
Finn
is
with
the
Resistance.
I'm
just
a
scavenger.
Let's
see
what
you
got.
-

-

It's
just
a
piece.
Ever
since
Luke
disappeared...
people
have
been
looking
for
him.
REY:
Why
did
he
leave?
He
was
training
One
boy,
an
apprentice...
turned
against
him,
destroyed
it
all.
Luke
felt
responsible.
He
just
walked
away
from
everything.
Do
you
know
what
happened
to
him?
A
lot
of
rumors.
Stories.
People
that
knew
him
best...
think
he
went
looking
The
Jedi
were
real?
I
used
to
wonder
about
that
myself.
Thought
it
was
a
bunch
A
magical
power
holding
the
dark
side
and
the
light.
Crazy
thing
is...
it's
true.
The
Force.
The
Jedi.
All
of
it.
It's
all
true.

-

Gonna
see
an
old
friend.
This
is
our
stop.
I
didn't
know
there
was
in
the
whole
galaxy.

Hey,
Solo,
I'm
not
sure
what
Did
you
just
call
me
Solo?
Sorry.
Han.
Mr.
Solo.
You
should
know...
I'm
a
big
deal
in
the
Resistance.
Which
puts
a
real
target
on
my
back.
Are
there
any
conspirators
here?
Like,
First
Order
sympathizers?
Listen,
Big
Deal.
You
got
another
problem.
Women
always
figure
out
the
truth.
Always.
You
might
need
this.
I
think
I
can
handle
myself.
I
know
you
do.
That's
why
Take
it.
You
know
how
to
use
one
of
those?
Yeah.
You
pull
the
trigger.
Little
bit
more
to
it
than
that.
You
got
a
lot
to
learn.
You
got
a
name?
Rey.
Rey.
I
been
thinking
about
bringing
A
second
mate.
Someone
to
help
out.
Someone
who
can
keep
up
appreciates
the
Falcon.
Are
you
offering
me
a
job?
I
wouldn't
be
nice
to
you.
You're
offering
me
a
job.
I'm
thinking
about
it.
Well?
If
you
were,
I'd
be
flattered.
Where,
Jakku?
I've
already
been
away
too
long.
Chewie,
check
out
the
ship

That's
too
bad.
Chewie
kind
of
likes
you.
FINN:
Solo,
why
are
we
here
again?
HAN:
To
get
your
droid
on
a
clean
ship.
REY:
Clean?
HAN:
You
think
it
was
luck
If
we
can
find
it
on
our
scanners...
the
First
Order's
not
far
behind.
Wanna
get
BB-8
to
the
Resistance?
Maz
Kanata's
our
best
bet.
FINN:
We
can
trust
her,
right?
HAN:
Relax,
kid.
She's
run
this
watering
hole
Maz
is
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste...
so
let
me
do
the
talking.
And
whatever
you
do,
don't
stare.
BOTH:
At
what?
Any
of
it.


-
Han
Solo!
-


Oh,
boy.
Hey,
Maz.

Where's
my
boyfriend?
Chewie's
working
on
the
Falcon.
I
like
that
Wookiee.
I
assume
you
need
something.
Desperately.
Let's
get
to
it.








KYLO
REN:
Forgive
me.
I
feel
it
again.
The
pull
to
the
light.
Supreme
Leader
senses
it.
Show
me
again.
The
power
of
the
darkness.
And
I
will
let
nothing
stand
in
our
way.
Show
me...
Grandfather...
and
I
will
finish...
what
you
started.
-

To
Skywalker
himself?

You
are
right
back
Maz,
I
need
you
to
get
this
droid
to
Leia.
Hmm...
No.
You've
been
running
away
Han.

Go
home.
Leia
doesn't
wanna
see
me.
Please,
we
came
here
for
your
help.
What
fight?
The
only
fight.
Against
the
dark
side.
Through
the
ages...
I've
seen
evil
take
many
forms.
The
Sith.
The
Empire.
Today,
it
is
the
First
Order.
Their
shadow
is
spreading
We
must
face
them.
Fight
them.
All
of
us.
There
is
no
fight
against
the
First
Order.
Not
one
we
can
win.
Look
around.
There's
no
chance
we
haven't
I
bet
you
the
First

What's
this?
What
are
you
doing?
-

Solo,
what
is
she
doing?
I
don't
know.
But
it
ain't
good.
If
you
live
long
enough...
you
see
the
same
eyes
I'm
looking
at
the
eyes
You
don't
know
a
thing
about
me.
Where
I'm
from.
What
I've
seen.
You
don't
know
the
First
Order
like
I
do.
They'll
slaughter
us.
We
all
need
to
run.
Hmm.

You
see
those
two?
They'll
trade
work
for
transportation...
to
the
Outer
Rim.
There,
you
can
disappear.
REY:
Finn?
Come
with
me.
What
about
BB-8?
We're
not
done
yet.
We
have
to
get
him
back
to
your

I
can't.
Keep
it,

Who's

I

I'm

my

General...
I
regret
to
inform

but
this

And
even
worse,

Don't

back.

nothing

could
There's
too
much
Vader

just

away.
That's

went

But

Me.
You.
If

see

would
have
disappointed
you.
Get
out

know

It's

And
now
you'll
give
it

Don't
be
afraid.

too.
I'm
not
giving

anything.
