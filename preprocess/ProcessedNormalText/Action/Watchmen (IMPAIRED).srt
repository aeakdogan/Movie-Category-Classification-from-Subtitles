1
:
The
United
States'
lack
of
action
...proves
that
the
Soviet
Union's
aggression
...will
not
be
opposed
publicly

Issue:
The
Soviet
Union
continued
...conducting
a
bomb
test
today
...just
1500
miles

Richard
Nixon
MAN
2:
Let
it
be
clear
we
maintain
our
strength...
...in
order
to
maintain
peace...
...so
any
adversary
"Do
the
consequences
...outweigh
the
potential
benefits?"
As
a
result
of
the
Soviet
activity...
...the
watchdog
group
...moved
the
Doomsday
Clock
Destruction
by
nuclear
war.
Question:
On
a
scale
of
zero
to
10,
...10
meaning
...what
are
the
chances
the
Russians
Pat
Buchanan.
Zero.
The
Soviets
...when
we
have
a
walking
nuclear
deterrent
You're
referring,
of
course,
...but
does
Dr.
Manhattan's
existence
Well,
it
hasn't
...from
stockpiling
record
amounts
You
don't
think
it's
just
posturing?
Maybe
the
reason
...are
doing
these
bomb
tests...
...is
because
they
feel
threatened
Maybe
the
whole
world
feels
like
that.

This

afraid
of

I've
seen
its

...and
the
gutters
are
full
of
blood.
And
when
the

finally
scab
over...
...all
the

will
drown.
The

foam
up

And

...staring
down

All

all

sudden,
Beneath

this
awful

It
screams
like

reeks
of

Huh.
Tonight,
a

died
in
New

Somebody

Somebody

MAN:
It
all
started
with
the
gangs.
Pirate
outfits,
ghosts.
They
thought
it
was
funny:

As
soon
as
we'd
arrest
them,
Nobody
could
pick
them
out
of
a
lineup
So
a
few
of
us
cops,
we
get
together...
...and
we
figure,
what
the
heck,
We'll
finish
what
the
law
couldn't.
Pretty
soon,
the
papers
get
wind
of
it.
...and
oh,
boy,
we're
a
national
pastime.
It
was
me,
Dollar
Bill,
Mothman...
...Captain
Metropolis,
Hooded
Justice...
...Silk
Spectre
and
the
Comedian.
Oh,
don't
get
me
started
on
him.
I
must
be
drunk
already,
I
think
you
were
trying
to
make
a
point.
Well,
my
point
is
that
we
had
it
too
easy.
You
guys
who
picked
up
where
we
left
off.
Nixon,
oh,
that
prick.
To
think
I
voted
Hey,
it
was

or
the

right?
Oh,
wow,
it's
almost

You
ever

No.
You?
Oh,
heck,
no.
Be
seeing
you.

Hello,
Daniel.
Rorschach.
Helped
myself
to
some
beans.
No,
no.
Course
not.
You
want
me
to
heat
those
up
for
you?
Fine
like
this.
How
have
you
been
keeping?
RORSCHACH:
So
far.
Daniel...
...look
at
this.
DAN:
Is
this
bean
juice?
Badge
belonged
to
the
Comedian.
Let's
talk
downstairs.
It
could
have
been
a
burglary.
Maybe
the
killer
didn't
know
RORSCHACH:
An
ordinary
burglar?
I
heard
he'd
been
working
...knocking
over
Marxist
republics
Maybe
it
was
a
political
killing
Maybe.
Maybe
someone's
picking
off
DAN:
That
what
they
say
about
me
now?
Paranoid?
DAN:
Look,
Comedian
made
...even
among
his
friends.
RORSCHACH:
He
wrote
that
book.
Said
some
bad
things
I
don't
like
what
you're
implying,
Maybe
I
was
keeping
an
eye
on
you,
-
You
were
never
that
sentimental.
What
do
you
suggest
we
do
about
it?
Retribution.
-
Watchmen
are
over.
Says
me.
Nobody
knows
who
you
are.
You
can
give
it
up,
That
what
you
have
now?
When
you
walk
down
the
street
...past
the
human
cockroaches...
...talking
about
their
heroin
...do
you
really
feel
normal?
Least
I'm
not
the
one
No.
You're
hiding
in
plain
sight.
Be
seeing
you,
Dan.
A
maintenance
hatch
Yeah,
I
remember.
Came
here
often,
DAN:
Those
were
great
times,
huh,
-
What
happened?

...to

...ever

And
you've
certainly
profited
greatly
...turning

ego,
Toys,
lunchboxes,

I
understand
there's
a
movie
-
I'm
not
hearing
a
question,
Mr.
Roth.
The
Watchmen
resent
me
It's
a
fair
question.

you're
clearly
aware

Now,
it
doesn't
take

see
that

...it's

But
if
we

...ah...
...we

obsolete.
I
would

they
may

Thanks
for
your
time.

You
look
good,
Adrian.
It's
been
too
long.
So
Rorschach
thinks
You
think
it's
possible?
Statistically,
one
murder
Rorschach's
a
sociopath,
Dan.
And
so
was
the
Comedian.
You
know
that
better
than
anyone.
I'm
not
here
because
I
miss
him.
It's
occurred
to
Rorschach...
...that
we're
the
only
ones
Actually,
the
whole
world
knows
yours.
That's
why
I'm
warning
you
first.
Thank
you,
Dan...
...but
I
fear
there's
something
...than

shouldn't

RORSCHACH:
I
have
a
real
name
I've
been
using.
Try
it.
Whatever
you
say,
Laurie.
What
are
you
doing
here?
JON:
Rorschach
wants
me
...see
if
the
killer
is
ever
Already
warned
Dreiberg.
Even
if
I
wanted
to
help...
...my

is
blocked

I
cannot
see

must
return

RORSCHACH:
What
if
that's
why
So
we
can't
do
anything
to
stop
it?
Goodbye,
Rorschach.
RORSCHACH:
Took
a
lot
of
effort
I'm
not
leaving...
-
till
I've
had
my
say.
Seems
like
there's
a
lot
of
things
I
didn't
wanna
worry
you
prematurely.
If
Adrian
and
I
can
solve

crisis,
LAURIE:
If
that's
true,
If
only
you
could
perceive

as
I
do.
Please
let
me
show
you.

That
is
what
I
had
before.
It's
not
my
fault

got
old.
I'm
putting
food
on

Call
your
friend
Eddie.
-
It
was
a
mistake.
One
time.
Stop!
Your
mind
goes
to
dark
places...
...and
you
wonder
-
Say
hello
to
Dan
for
me.
You
wanna
ask
me
...like
we
used
to...
...but
you
won't.
You
know
I
can't.
So
you'll
call
Dan...
...which
is
only
natural.
You
deserve
the
comfort
of
an
old
friend.
LAURIE:
DAN:
Did
you
know
that
You
remember
that
crazy
guy?
Captain
Carnage.
Used
to
pretend
he
was
a
supervillain
Yeah,
he
tried
that
on
me
once.
He
starts
following
me
down
the
street
...yelling,
"Punish
me!
Punish
me!"
I'm
just
saying,
"No,
get
lost."
God,
whatever
happened
to
him?
Oh.
Um...
...and
Rorschach
Oh,
my
God.
That's
not
even
funny.
-
It's
a
little
funny.
WOMAN:
I'm
glad
I
ordered
It's
really
good
to
see
you
again.
It's
great
seeing
you
too.
Why'd
we
do
it,
Dan?
Dress
up
like
that?
-
No
one
else
would.
All
that
tight
latex?
Uh...
Yeah,
yeah,
awful.
But
didn't
wanna
disappoint

Wanted

girl
to
be
just
like
her

think

Keene
Act
was
the
best
thing
Well,
we'll
live
longer
anyway.
What?
Jon
thinks,
unless
he
can
do
something
...that
there's
gonna
be
nuclear
war.
Soon.
But
I
don't
know
what
to
think.
...quantum
mechanics
I
never
even
know
He
just
keeps
getting
further
away
Everyone.
I
can't
even
tell
...or
if
he's
just
pretending.
If
he's
pretending,
it
means
he
cares.
Hold
on,
I'll
get
the
door.
Thanks,
Dan.
-
Got
it?
I'm
sorry.
I
invite
you
out
to

to
catch
up
...but
there
don't
seem
to
be

do
you
expect?

Is
that

Thought
you'd
be
used

sent

this?

is

of
flattering.

do
you
always
call

know
why
you're
here.

saw
it
in

Blake's
funeral
is

got

don't

happened

doing
here?
Sure
I
did.
Come
on,
baby.
I
know
what
you
need.
You
gotta
have

of

said
no,

-

You
know,
you'd
think
this
goddamn
You
know,
if
we'd
lost
here
in
Vietnam...
...I
think
it
might
have
driven

crazy.
But

didn't,

Welcome
to

For

who
calls
himself
the

Watchmen.
That's
the
real
joke.
It
didn't
work
15
years
ago,
...because
you
wanna
play
Maybe
we
should
agree

Rorschach
and
I
have
made
headway
A
group
this
size
seems
like
ADRIAN:
We
can
save
this
world...

...with
the
right
leadership.
And
that'd
be
you,
right,
Ozzy?

must
clear

If
you
could...

it.
All
right.
There's
no
need
for
violence.

this
is
getting

can
we
keep
this
up?

it's

what?
-

Get
your
stinking

off

What
the

happened
to

happened

are

talking

I
break
another
finger.
I
did
my
time.
I'm
not
Moloch
anymore.
-
What
do
you
want
from
me?
I
just
felt
I
should...
...pay
my
respects
to
the
Comedian.
-
How'd
you
know
he
was
the
Comedian?
He
had
his
mask
off.
-
He
was
drunk.
-

should
he
visit

I
woke
up
in

was

He
was
crying.

I
was
pissing
in

pants.
I
thought
he
was
gonna
kill

RORSCHACH:
It's
a
joke.
It's
all
a
fucking
joke.
You
know,
I
thought
I
knew
how
it
was.
I
thought
I
knew
how
the
world
was.
I've
done
some
bad
things.
I
did
bad
things
to

I
shot

A

I
heard
joke
once.
Man
goes
to

says
he's
depressed.
Life
seems
harsh
and
cruel.
Says
he
feels
all
alone
Doctor
says

you

Yes.

were

together
He
died
of

was

tells

and
worried.

says

tell

there

I
always
will.

I
lie

it
is

am

very
young

looks
at
me
and
smiles.
She's
beautiful.
After
each
long
kiss,
she
plants
a
smaller,
...like
a
signature.

accuses
me
of
chasing
jailbait.
She
bursts
into
angry
tears,
It's
true.
She's
aging
more
noticeably
every
day...

...while
I
am
standing
still.
I
prefer
the
stillness
here.
I
am
tired

I'm
tired
of
being
caught

claim

Perhaps
nothing

See,
doctor,
God
didn't
kill
that
little
girl.
Fate
didn't
butcher
her
If
God
saw
what
any
of
us
did
that
night,
From
then
on,
I
knew:
God
doesn't
make
the
world
this
way.
We
do.
MAN
1:
Hey,
you're
pretty
famous,
right?
MAN
2:
Rorschach,
I
heard
your
mother
Hey,
you
know
what?
-
Ain't
that
right?
That's
right.
Maybe
I
can
give
you
an
autograph.

None
of
you
seem
to
understand.
OFFICER:
You're
locked
in
here
with
me.


DAN:
Shit.
DAN:
Hold
on.
I
got
it,
I
got
it,
I
got
it.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
was
snooping
-
Are
you
hurt?
-
Okay.
No,
don't
worry.
It's
happened
before.
Archie
survived
that.
LAURIE:
Oh.
Well,
uh,
short
for
Archimedes...
...Merlin's
pet
owl.
Stupid
nickname.
LAURIE:
How
did
you
ever
afford
Well,
my
dad
was
in
corporate
banking
...which
always
surprised
me.
I
think
he
was
disappointed
...instead
of
following
him.
Guess
I
was
just
more
interested
in
Must
be
nice
having
a
secret
identity.
A
secret
place
that
nobody
knows
about.
You
can
just
come
down

hang
out

you.
Wanna
try
those

There
we
go.
Wow,
these

They
amplify
the
spectral
range.
Thermal
imaging.
They
work
even
better
in
the
dark.
You
can
see
me,
right?
I
can
see
everything.
I
remember,
no
matter
how
black
it
got...
...whenever
I
looked
through
those
goggles,
This
must
be
the
way
Jon
sees
the
world.
We
should
probably
head
up.
Put
those
away
when
you're
done.
MAN
:
Soviets
are
...in
bloody

Casualties
on
both
sides
Civilian

are
also
alarmingly
high.
Dan.
Jon
sees
a
lot
of
things...
...but
he
doesn't
see
me.
Well,
uh...

Oh.
Sorry.
Come
here.
What's
the
matter?
-
If
you
could

little...
Yeah.
There

Dan,
what's
wrong?
Sorry,
I...
Yeah,
I
just
need
a
couple
minutes.
Oh,
hell.
It's
been
a
long
time,
Rorschach.
RORSCHACH:
Small
world.
I
like
that.
But
you
know,
it
is
a
small
world
in
here.
And
I've
been
in
it
for,
LLOYD:
That's
right.
Fifteen
years
since
you
So...
...Rorschach,
that
guy
you
burned
is
dying.
You
know,
by
my
count,
there
are
more
I
been
talking
to
every
one
of
them
This
place
is
gonna
explode!
Then,
you
die
by
inches.
Tall
order.
I'm
gonna
tear
this
guy
a
new
hole.
Relax,
Lawrence.
Soon.
Come
on.

Dan?
Is
everything
all
right?
I'm
tired
of
being
afraid.
Afraid
of
war...
...afraid
of
the
mask
killer...
...and
afraid
of
this
goddamn
suit...
...and
how
much
I
need
it.
Me
too.
So
to
hell
with
it.
Let's
take
Archie
out.
You're
serious.
I
used
to
be
a
masked
avenger
too,
I'm
used
to
going
out
at
3
in
the
morning

MAN

Let's
go.
LAURIE:
I
can

it.
LAURIE:
Everyone,
stay
where
you
are
We're
gonna
get
you
out
of

DAN:
Let's
go.
DAN:
Watch
your

We're
all
set.
Is
that
everyone?
MAN:
Bye.
LAURIE:
-
They'll
lock
us
up
with
Rorschach.
World
War

start

Right?
Right.






MAN:
He's
dead,
Rorschach.
While
everyone's
distracted,
we
thought
Something
from

Hey,
boss,
you
notice?
None
of
that
"small
world,
He
knows
once
we
slice
open
his
lock,
Fat
chance.
You're
dead,
Rorschach!
We
got
a
prison
full
of
killers
out
here.

Your
hands,
my
pleasure.

LLOYD:
This
riot
won't
last.
I'm
sorry,
Lawrence,
but
you're
in
the
way
Nothing
personal,
big
guy.

Boss!
Wait!
Now
you
find
out
what
the
score
is.
One-nothing.
Come
and
get
me.
Come
on.
DAN:
I
feel
that
we
have
an
obligation
-
I
think
we
ought
to
spring
Rorschach.
DAN:
And
this
whole
cancer
thing
with
Jon,
You
didn't
get
it.
Yeah,
but
breaking
...is
a
little
different
than
putting
out
a
fire.
It'll
be
more
fun.
Hurry,
Lloyd.
I
wanna
Yes.
No.
Never

Two-nothing.
Your

BIG

No.
No.
Where's
my

Don't
kill

Your

Tell
me,
what
do
you
see?
Don't
move!
Rorschach.
Daniel.
Miss

Excuse
me.
Have
to
visit

Oh,
for
chrissake.

Are
you
all
right?
Yeah.
Just...
...heavy,
you
know?
War,
jailbreak.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Okay?
-
Hello,
Laurie.
-
TV
said
you
were
on
Mars.
You
and
I
are
about
What
are
you
talking
about?
You're
going
to
try
to
convince
me
-
Laurie,
don't.
I
have
to
go.
Beautiful,
isn't
it?


Forgive
me.
These
things
sometimes
It
won't
happen
again.
LAURIE:
Oh,
my
God.
I'm
on
Mars.
RORSCHACH:
We
need
to
hit
up
Sure,
why
don't
we
just
pick
names
You
forgot
how
we
do
things,
Daniel.
You've
gone
too
soft.
Too
trusting.
Okay,
no.
Listen,
I've
had
it
with
that.
God,
who
do
you
You
live
off
people
...and
no
one
complains
because
they
think
I'm
sorry.
I
shouldn't
have
said
that,
man.
Daniel...
...you
are
a
good

I
know

can
be

you
ask

why
would

save

...I
no
longer
have
any
stake
in?
Then
do
it
for

If

really
care.
When

I
left

Does
that

This
represents
the
culmination
of
a
dream

dream

for

am

Why?
What's

I
cannot
imagine
Used
to
joke
he
was
fast
enough
He
could
kill
us
both
alone
in

snow.
That's
where
we're
going
now:
Whether
I'm
alive

dead

hope

survives
long
enough
I
live
my

free
of
compromise...

st.
LAURIE:
Can't
you
just
tell
me
how
JON:
Tears?
So
you
don't
come
back
to
Earth.
At
some
point,
yes.
The
streets
are
filled
with
death.
Jon,
please.
You
have
to
stop
this.
Everyone
will
die.
And
the
universe
will
not
even
notice.
In
my
opinion,
the
existence
of
life...
...is
a
highly
overrated
phenomenon.
Just
look
around
you.
Mars
gets
along
perfectly
well
Here,
it's
a
constantly
changing
...flowing
and
shifting
around
the
pole
So
tell
me...
...how
would
all
of
this
be
greatly
improved
By
a
shopping
mall?
So
it's
too
much
to
ask
for
a
miracle?
Miracles,
by
their
definition,
Oh,
God,
Jon!
-
Only
what
can
happen
does
happen.
Land
this
thing.
Now.
JON:
LAURIE:
You
can
send
me
back
to
Earth
...and
all
the
other
worthless
humans.
But
know
that
you
were
wrong.
...and
look:
Nothing.
You
complain
that
I
refuse
to
see
life
...yet
you
continuously
refuse
-
You
shut
out
what
you're
afraid
of.
You
want
me
to
see
things
your
way?
Magic.
Dreams.
That
is
what
I
had
before.
It's
not
my
fault
you
got
old.
I
put
food
on
the
table
Call
your
friend
Eddie.
SALLY:
...keep
on
getting
brighter.
You're
Sally
Jupiter's
kid.
You're
the
Comedian,
right?
You
were
pretty
cool
in
there.
You
know,
your
mom,
she
was
one
-
You
got
her
eyes,
you
know.
You
got...
EDDIE:
Not
long
enough
in
my
book,
Eddie.
Now.
Are
there
no
depths
you
won't
sink
to?
Jesus
Christ,
Sally.
...you
know,
old
friend's
daughter?
Drive.
SALLY:
Guy
tries
to
rape
you,
and
years
later,
What?
Were
you
drunk
or
just
lonely?
Am
I
ever
gonna
live
this
down?
Laurie.
No.
No,
not
him.
The
Comedian...
...was
your
father.
No.
No!
No!
No!

My
life
is
just...
...one
big
joke.
I
don't
think
your
life
is
a
joke.
Yeah,
well...
...I'm
sorry
if
I
don't
Will
you
smile...
...if
I
admit
I
was
wrong?
LAURIE:
Miracles.
Events
with
astronomical
odds
...like
oxygen
turning
into
gold.
I've
longed
to
witness
such
an
event,
...that
in
human
coupling...
...millions
upon
millions
of
cells
...for
generation
after
generation...
...until
finally,
your
mother...
...loves
a
man...
...Edward
Blake,
the
Comedian,
...and
out
of
that
contradiction,
...it's
you...
Only...
...you.
-
That
emerged.
To
distill
so
specific
a
form...
...from
all
that
chaos...
...is
like
turning
air
into
gold.
A
miracle.
And
so...
...I
was
wrong.
Now
dry
your
eyes,
and
let's
go
home.
We
got
a
bearing
on
that
artificial
structure.
-
Veidt.
-
The
engines.
Daniel,
you're
coming
in
too
low.
Don't
wish
to
interfere,
I
know!
I'm
trying.
DAN:
I'm
gonna
redirect
the
heat
from
...but
it's
gonna
take
a
while
You
need
something
warmer.
Fine
like
this.

What
is
it,
girl?
Mm.
DAN:
He's
a
vegetarian,
for
chrissakes.
Hitler
was
vegetarian.
You're
squeamish,
leave
him
to
me.

Gentlemen.
-
Welcome.
Then
what's
there
to
discuss,
Dan?
Plenty.
You
killed
Comedian.
May
he
rest
in
peace.
Blake
figured
it
out
first.
Nixon
had
him
keeping
tabs
on
us,
Blake
found
out
what
I
was
doing
...and
by
the
time
he
visited
poor
Moloch,
Even
I
couldn't
predict
he'd
be
the
one
So...
...I
had
to
kill
him.
Then
I
neutralized
Jon.
No
easy
task.
I
put
roughly
$2
billion
...to
block
Jon's
vision
of
the
future.
RORSCHACH:
You
used
his
psych
profile
Got
him
to
leave
the
planet.
I've
known
Jon
long
enough
His
subtle
facial
twitches
wouldn't
be
...he
might
as
well
have
been
sobbing.
All
I
needed
to
do
was
tug
on
the
thread.
The
sudden
flood
of
emotion
Jon
felt...
...when
he
came
to
believe
...was
all
the
excuse
he
needed
DAN:
Your
bullshit
assassin.
ADRIAN:
Mr.
Chess
gave
his
life
I
put
a
cyanide
capsule
in
his
mouth...
...leaving
only
one
loose
end:
You,
and
your
mask-killer
theory...
...one
you
followed
I
tipped
off
the
police.
Once
you
were
in
prison,
RORSCHACH:
DAN:
We
were
supposed
to
make
the
world
ADRIAN:
DAN:
Human
extinction?
ADRIAN:
Of
course,
my
moral
safeguards
A
few
key
regions
around
the
globe...
New
York,
Los
Angeles,
Moscow,
-
Disintegrated
in
an
instant.
Fifteen
million
people
killed...
...by
Dr.
Manhattan
himself.
The
world's
punishment
Jon
wouldn't
do
that.
A
fact
no
one
outside
this
room
The
energy
breakthrough
I
was
working
on
All
these
years,
Jon
was
helping
me
...unaware
of
how
I
planned
to
use
it.
You
see...
...the
Comedian
was
right.
Humanity's
savage
nature
So
in
order
to
save
this
planet...
...I
had
to
trick
it...
...with
the
greatest
practical
joke
-
Killing
millions.
A
necessary
crime.
RORSCHACH:
"Do
that,"
Rorschach?
I'm
not
a
comic-book
villain.
Do
you
think
...if
there
were
even
the
slightest
possibility
I
triggered
it
35
minutes
ago.
Jesus
Christ,
Henry.
Why
the
hell
It's
not
the
Soviets,
sir.
Intel
indicates
the
energy
signature...
...was
generated
by...
...Dr.
Manhattan.
Jon.
Interference.
Cataclysmic
interference.
LAURIE:
This
wasn't
caused
by
nuclear
warheads.
It
was
me.
I...
...did
this.
-
What
do
you
mean,
you
did
this?
It
was
made
to
look
like
I
did
it.
Adrian.
Speak
of
the
devil.
DAN:
Jon...
RORSCHACH:
Must
stop
him.
Wait
here.
Adrian,
stop
this.
The
tachyons
were
clever...
...but
even
if
I
can't
predict
where
you
are,
I
should
thank
you.
I'd
almost
forgotten
the
excitement
...the
delights
of
uncertainty.
Forgive
me,
girl.

You're
such
an
asshole.

DAN:
-
If
you've
hurt
her,
I'll...
...grow
up.
My
new
world
Your...
...schoolboy
heroics
are
redundant.
Failing
to
prevent
Earth's
salvation...
...is
your
only
triumph.
JON:
I'm
very
disappointed.
Reassembling
myself
It
didn't
kill
Osterman.
Did
you
really
think
it
would
kill
me?
I
have
walked
across
the
surface
I
have
witnessed
events
...they
can
hardly
be
said
...but
you,
Adrian,
you're
just
a
man.
The
world's
smartest
man...
...poses
no
more
threat
to
me...
...than
does
its
smartest
termite.
What's
that?
Another
ultimate
weapon?
Yes.
You
could
say
that.
-

under
attack.
Millions
of
lives
were
suddenly
ended...
...in
an
act
of
evil
Since
the
attacks,
...with
the
premier
of
the
U.S.S.R.
Putting
aside
our
past
differences...
...we
have
both
pledged
to
unite...
...against
this
common
enemy.
With
the
rest
of
the
world...
...we
will
prevail.
This
is
a
day
we
shall
never
forget.
And
yet
we
go
forward
...and
all
that
is
good
Thank
you.
God
bless
us
all.
ADRIAN:
Two
superpowers
retreating
from
war.
I've
saved
the
earth
from
hell.
We
both
have.
This
is
as
much
your
victory
as
it
is
mine.
Now
we
can
return...
...do
what
we
were
meant
to.
We
were
meant
to
exact
justice.
-
Everyone's
gonna
know
what
you've
done.
By
exposing
me,
you
would
sacrifice

Peace
based
on
a
lie.
...nonetheless.
Exposing
Adrian
would
only
doom
the
world
No.
We
can't
do
this.
On
Mars...
...you
taught
me
the
value
of
life.
If
we
hope
to
preserve
it
here...
...we
must
remain
silent.
Keep
your
own
secrets.
Don't
even
think
about
it.
Rorschach.
Wait.
Never
compromise.
Not
even
in
the
face
of
armageddon.
That's
always
been
the
difference
I've
made
myself
feel
every
death...
...see
every
innocent
face
-
You
understand,
don't
you?
...or
condemning...
...I
understand.
Out
of
my
way.
People
have
to
be
told.
You
know
I
can't
let
you
do
that.
Suddenly
you
discover
humanity?
Convenient.
If
you'd
cared
from
the
start,
I
can
change
almost
anything...
...but
I
can't
change
human
nature.
Of
course
What's
one
more
body
Well,
what
are
you
waiting
for?
Do
it.
Do
it!
No!
JON:
I'm
leaving
this
galaxy
LAURIE:
I
thought
you
said
you
cared
JON:
I
think
maybe
I'll
create
some.
Goodbye,
Laurie.

Come
on.
Come
on!
Dan...
...a
world
united
and
at
peace.
There
had
to
be
sacrifice.
No!
You
haven't
idealized
mankind,
You've
mutilated
it.
That's
your
legacy.
That's
the
real
practical
joke.
MAN
:
We
repeat,
there
is
You
are
about
to
participate
You
are
about
to
experience
...which
reaches
from
the
inner
mind
SALLY:
I'm
okay.
Cheers.
There's
something
I
need
I
know
that
Eddie
Blake
was
my
father.
Laurel.
What
you
must
think
of
me.
I'm
sorry
I
never
told
you.
I
should
have...
...but
I
don't
know,
I
just
felt
ashamed.
It
doesn't
matter.
People's
lives
take
them
strange
places.
...and,
well,
I
know
how
that
is...
...but
I
just
want
you
to
know...
...that
you
never
did
anything
wrong
You
asked
me
why
I
wasn't
mad
at
him.
Because
he
gave
me
you.
Thanks,
Mom.
I
love
you.
-
Hello,
Miss
Jupiter.
Excuse
me.
Gotta
go
freshen
up.
-
So
how's
it
going
up
here?
Good.
I
think
I've
got
everything
working.
All
of
Archie's
systems
are
upgraded.
...so
all
we
gotta
do
is
take
her
out.
Well,
that
sounds
like
a
date.
Are
we
gonna
be
all
right?
Long
as
people
think
Jon's
...in
the
end.
I
know
what
Jon
would
say:
Nothing
ends.
Nothing
ever
ends.
Seymour,
we
got
nothing
Everyone
in
the
country...
...every
country
in
the
world
...and
singing
songs
It's
like
living
in
a
goddamn
Well,
Ronald
Reagan
says
he's
gonna
We
could
run
a
piece
on
that.
Seymour,
we
don't
dignify
absurdities
This
is
still
America,
damn
it.
Okay.
I
could
look
for
something
Crank
file.
Whatever.
Take
some
initiative.
Run
whatever
you
like.
