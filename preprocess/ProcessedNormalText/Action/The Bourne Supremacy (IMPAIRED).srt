you
You're

No,
she's

Last
week
He
was
trying
to
sell
out

I
killed
him?
There
were
partial
prints
-
That
is
insane.
Landy
will
find...
Last
week
They
came
for
me,
This
ends
now.

-
Please!
I'm
only
here
because
of
Paris.
Conklin's
boss.
Is
he
here
in
Berlin?
Did
he
run
Treadstone?
Did
he
run
Treadstone?

What
was
Landy
buying?
It
was
something
to
do
[Voices

Neski.

When...
When
was
I
here
in
Berlin?
What
are
you
talking
about?
When?
My

[Voices

In

Pam,
I
want
to
show
you
something.
We

three
levels,
we

tunnels.
Over

Luftschulzbunker.
How
many
men
are
out
there?
-
What's
our
security
situation
here?
Here
here.
In
the
building.

Okay,
let's
go
public.
-
And
check
out
his
story
You're
in
a
big
puddle
of
shit,
Pamela,
-
He
said
he
didn't
know
anything
about
Berlin.
-
Don't
you
think
that
was
for
our
benefit?
We
know
he
was
in
Berlin.
His
mind
is
broken.
What
now?
Terminate
him?
-
He
also
said
you
were
running
Treadstone.
He
knows
that
you're
after
him,
and
in
the
interest
of
self-preservation
Check
on
those
photos.


I
need
to
show
you

All
right,
I
finished
my
box
work,
Came
down
here
last
night...
because
none
of
this
I'm
with
you...
Conklin
was
a
nut.
I
just
can't
get
there.
All
right,
you
put
a
four-gam
Kel
on
here,
You
know
that.
There
were
two
charges
that
were
Now,
first
of
all,
this
is
nothing.
And
second,
why
put
the
charge
If
you're
good
enough
to
get
in
here
Bourne
would
know.
It
was
staged?
But
what
if
somebody
What
if
Bourne
didn't
have
-
Show
me
again.
Well,
you
put...

This
is
not
a
drill,
soldier.
This
is
a
live
project,
-
I'll
see
you
on
the
other
side.

"
-
Good
evening,
sir.
How
can
I
help
you?
Do
you
have
a
reservation?
Actually,
is
room
645
available?

I'm
sorry,
sir.
It's
right
across
the
hall.
Sir?
644?
I
just
need
your
passport
Have
a
nice
night.





Berlin
Polizei.
Where?
Okay,
we're
there.
-
Brecker?
How
far?


[Man,
Woman

Hey!

[Woman
Screaming,


Training
is
over.


-


Go!

Black
coat,
possibly
leather,
The
cops
out
there
That
will
really
work.
What
the
hell's
he
doing
here?

-



Polizei!
Polizei!
Polizei.!
Polizei.!

Polizei!
Polizei!

They
missed
him?
But
they
found
Nicky.
He
let
her
go?
Where's
Danny
Zorn?
Why
did
Bourne
come
here?
We
don't
know
yet.
She
said
she'd
call
you
Okay.
I
think
I'll,
uh...
take
a
cab
So,
the
room
he
checked
into
Mmm.
Why
would
he
come
in
here?
What
are
you
thinking?
There
was
a
chalk
outline
right
here
This
is
where
Do
you
still
think
Guess
he
got
out
We
just
got
word
They
found
Danny
Zorn's
body.
I
want
you
two
to
stay
on
Bourne.
Call
Abbott.
I'm
coming
to
see
him.



-
Da.
They're
onto
Neski.
This
is
not
a
clean
phone.
Kill
Bourne,
I'm
afraid,
Ward,
Listen,
Yuri,
you
bought
those
oil
leases
You
owe
me.
We
both
got
rich.
I
don't
owe
you
anything.
The
plan
can
still
be
salvaged.
He's
still
out
there.
GetJason...

I
don't
suppose
Not
much.
You
killed
her.
It
was
a
mistake.
It
was
supposed
to
be
you.
There
were
files
linking
me
If
the
files
disappeared
they'd
be
chasing
a
ghost
So
we
got
in
the
way.
Is
that
why
Neski
died?
You
killed
Marie...
the
minute
The
minute
you
entered
her
life,
I
told
you
people
I
fell
off
the
grid.
There's
no
place
It's
how
every
story
ends.
It's
what
you
are,
Jason...
You
always
will
be.
Go
ahead.
Go
on.
Go
on.!
She
wouldn't
want
me
to.
That's
the
only
reason

[Man
Speaking
German




I'm
a
patriot.
And
Danny
Zorn?
Collateral
damage.
So,
what
do
we
do
now?
I'm
not
sorry.





No,
no,
no,
forget
it.
No,
that's
nothing.
-
Good
synch-up.



That's
the
only
reason
Got
a
call
from
Langley.
They're,
uh,
going
through
and
Marshall
wants
to
know
Wait,
Teddy.
He's
about
to
enter...
Right
through
there.
-
Get
down
here!
We
got
something!
There.
I
got
it
on
the
big
monitor.
Here
it
comes
again.
-

Whoa,
whoa.
Hold
on.
What
train
is
that?
-
That's
the
train
to
Moscow.
Get
me

I
speak
English.
I'm
not
gonna
hurt
you.
I
won't
hurt
you.
You're
older.
Older
than
I
thought
you'd
be.
That
picture.
Does
that
mean
a
lot
to
you?
It's
nothing.
No.
It's
'cause
you
don't
know
I
do.
No,
you
don't.
I
would
want
to
know.
I
would
want
to
know
that
my...
that
she
didn't
kill
herself.
What?
It's
not
what
happened
I
killed
them.
I
killed
them.

It
was
my
job.
It
was
my
first
time.
Your
father
But
then
your
mother...
came
out
of
nowhere,
and
I
had
to
change
my
plan.
It
changes
things,
that
knowledge.
Doesn't
it?
When
what
you
love
you
wanna
know
the
truth.

I'm
sorry.


Pamela
Landy.
Bourne?
I
wanted
to
thank
you...
for
the
tape.

I
guess
I
owe
you
an
apology.
Is
that
official?
No.
Off
the
record.
Good-bye.
Wait.
Wait.

Webb.
That's
your
real
name.

were
born

don't
you
come
in
Bourne?
Get
some
rest,
Pam.
