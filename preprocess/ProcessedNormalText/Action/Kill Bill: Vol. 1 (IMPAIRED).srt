you
find
me
sadistic?
You
know,
I'll
bet
I
could
fry
an

If
I
wanted
to.
You
know,
kiddo...
I'd
like
to
believe
to
know
that
there's

maybe
towards

not

No,
kiddo.
At

Sarah,
I
cannot
believe
What

gonna
do
now,
huh?
Got
your
ass!
Okay.
Come
on.
Mommy,
I'm
home.
Hey,
baby.
How
was
school?
Mommy,
what
happened
to
you
That
good-for-nothing
dog
in
the
living
room
-
That's
what
happened,
baby.
Baby,
now,
you

There's

This
is
an
old
friend

Hi,
honey.
I'm

name
is

Nikki.
Such

pretty
name
How
old
are
you,
Nikki?
Nikki,

asked
you
I'm

4
years
old,
eh?
You
know,
She'd
be
about
4
now.
Now,
baby,
me
and
Mommy's
friend
got
some
grown-up
talk
You
go
in

And
I
want

Yeah.
Sure.

Do
you

Yeah.
Thanks.
You

Yeah.
So
I
suppose
it's
a
little
late
You
suppose
correctly.
Look,
bitch,
I
need
to
know
if
you're
gonna
start
any
more
shit
You
can
relax
for
now.
I'm
not
gonna
murder
you
That's
being
more
rational
than
Bill
led
me
to
believe
It's
mercy,
compassion,
Not
rationality.
Look.
I
know
I
fucked
you
over.
I
fucked
you
over
bad.
I
wish
to
God
I
hadn't,
You
have
every
right
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
No.
To
get

even
Stephen,
I
would
have
to
kill
you,
then
wait
for
your
husband,
and
kill
him.
That
would
be
even,
Vernita.
That'd
be
about
square.
Look,
if
I
could
go
back
But
I
can't.
All
I
can
tell
you
is
that
Oh,
great.
I
don't
care.
Be
that
as
it
may,
I
know
I
don't
deserve
However,
I
beseech
you
for
both
Bitch,
you
can
stop
right
there.
Just
because
I
have
no
wish
before
the
eyes
of
your
daughter
does
not
mean
that
parading
her
is
gonna
inspire
sympathy.
You
and
I
have
And
not
a
goddamn
fucking
thing
in
the
subsequent
four
years,
including
getting
knocked
up,
So
when
do
we
do
this?
It
all
depends.
When
do
you
want
to
die?
Tomorrow?
How
about
tonight,
bitch?
Splendid.
There's
a
baseball
diamond
about
a
mile
from

We
meet
there
around
2.30
dressed
all

we
have
us

We
won't
be

Now,
I
have
to
fix

said
you
were

Fuck
you,
bitch.
I
know
he
didn't
qualify
So
you
can
just
kiss

motherfucking
ass,

I
should
have
been

of
choice?
If
you
want
to
stick
with

Very
funny,

Very
funny!
It
was
not
my
intention
For
that,
I'm
sorry.
But
you
can
take
my
word
for
it.
Your
mother
had
it
coming.
When
you
grow
up,
if
you
I'll
be
waiting.
For
those

Comatose.

That's

You
said
"domo."
No,
no.
Just
a

words
I
learned
Um,
may
I
sit
at
the
bar?
Oh,
sure,
sure,
sure.
Oh.
What
other
words
did
you
learn?
Oh,
just
a
minute.
We
have
a
customer.
I'm
watching
my

operas.
Lazy
bastard...
Screw
your
soap
opera...
hurry
up!
The
tea's
hot.
Shut
up!
Get
your
ass
out
here!
Uh,
excuse
me.
Uh,
what
other
Japanese
Oh,
let's
see.
"Arigato."

no.
Pronunciation
very
good.
You
say
arigato
Well,
thank
you.
You
should
learn

Very
easy.
No
kidding.
Most
difficult.
But
you
have

tongue.
Okay,
okay.
Oh,
my

Hey,
what
the

happened
to
the
tea?!
Lazy
oaf...
What
d'ya
want?
I
beg
your
pardon?
Uh,
drink.
Oh,
yes.
Warm
sake?
Very
good!
One
warm
sake!
Sake?
In
the
middle
of
the
day?
-
Day,
night,
afternoon
-
How
come
I
always
have
to
get
the
sake?
You
listen
well...
For
thirty
years,
you
make
the
fish,
If
this
were
the
military,
I'd
be
General
by
now!
Oh,
so
you'd
be
General,
huh?
If
you
were
General,
I'd
be
Emperor,
and
you'd
still
get
the
sake
-
and
you'd
still
get
the
sake
-
Do
you
understand?
I'm
not
bald,
okay?
I
shaved
my
head.
Do
you
understand
me?
Sorry.
First
time
in
Japan?
-
Uh-huh.
What
brings
you
to
Okinawa?
I
came
to
see
a
man.
Oh,
yeah.
You
have
a
friend
Not
quite.
Not
friend?
I
never
met
him.
Never?

May
I
ask?
Hattori
Hanzo.

What
do
you
want
with
Hattori
Hanzo?
I
need
Japanese
steel.
Why
do
you
need
Japanese
steel?
I
have
vermin
to
kill.
You
must
have
big
rats,
Huge.
May
I?
You
may.
Wait.
Try
the
second
one
down.
Funny.
You
like
samurai
swords.
I
like
baseball.
I
wanted
to
show
you
these.
However...
...someone
as
you,
who
knows
so
much,
must
...I
no
longer
make
instruments
of
death.
What
I
have
here...
...I
keep
for
their
aesthetic
and
sentimental
value.
Yet
proud
as
I
am
of
my
life's
work...
...I
have
retired.
Then
give
me
one
of
these.
These
are
not
for
sale.
I
didn't
say
"sell
me."
I
said
"give
me."

Why
should
I
help
you?
Because
my
vermin
And
considering
the
student,
I'd
say
you
have
You
can
sleep
here.
It
will
take
me
a
month...
...to
make
the
sword.
I
suggest
you
spend
it
practicing.
I've
completed
doing...
...what
I
swore
an
oath
to
God,
28
years
ago,
...to
never
do
again.
I
have
created
"something
that
kills
people."
And
in
that
purpose,
I
was
a
success.
I've
done
this
because
philosophically,
I
am
sympathetic
to
your
aim.
I
can
tell
you
with
no
ego,
this
is
my
finest
sword.
If
on
your
journey,
you
should
encounter
God...
...God
will
be
cut.

How
'bout

boy?
Do

still
wish
to
penetrate
me...
...or
is
it
I...
...or
is
it
I...
who
has
penetrated
you?
See
what
I
mean?
The
bald
guy
in
the
black
suit
the
head
general
of
O-Ren's
personal
army,
And
just
in
case
how
could
a
half-breed
become
the
boss
of
all
bosses

subject
of
O-Ren's
blood
came
up
before
the
council
The
night
O-Ren
assumed
power

man
who
seems
bound
to
break
the
mood
And
what
Boss
Tanaka
Boss
Tanaka!
What's
the
meaning
of
this
outburst?
This
is
a
time
for
celebration!
And
what
exactly
are
we
celebrating?
The
perversion
of
our
illustrious
council?
Tanaka,
have
you
gone
mad?
I
will
not
tolerate
this!
You're
disrespecting
our
sister!
Apologize!
Tanaka-San,
of
what
perversion
do
you
speak?
My
father...
...along
with
yours,
and
along
with
yours,
And
while...
...you
laugh
like
stupid
donkeys...
...they
weep
in
the
afterlife...
-
Shut
up!
...over
the
perversion
committed
today!
Outrageous!
Tanaka,
it
is
you
who
insults
this
council!
Bastard!
Fuck
face!
Gentlemen.
Tanaka
obviously
has
something
on
his
mind.
By
all
means,
allow
him
to
express
it.
I
speak,
of
the
perversion
done
to
this
...which
I
love...
...more
than
my
own
children,
...by
making
a
Chinese
Jap-American
Aah!
Aah!
So
that
you
understand
how
serious
I
am...
...I'm
going
to
say
this
in
English.
Huh!
-
As
your
leader...
I
encourage
you
and
always
in
a
respectful
manner,
If
you're
unconvinced
a
particular
plan
of
action
tell
me
so.
But
allow
me
to
convince
you.
And
I
promise
you,
no
subject
will
ever
be
taboo.
Except,
of
course,
the
subject
The
price
you
pay
for
bringing
up
either
as
a
negative
is,
Just
like
this
fucker
here.
Now,
if
any
of
you
got
anything
else
to
say,
I
didn't
think
so.
Gentlemen,
this
meeting
is
adjourned.

Go
home
to
your
mother!

Those
of
you
lucky
enough
to
still
...take
them
with
you!
However...
...leave
the
limbs
you've
lost.
They
belong
to
me
now.
Except
you,
Sofie!
You
stay
right
where
you

five
minutes.
But
as
last
looks
go,
you
could
do
worse.

You
may
not
be
able
to
fight
But
you
can
at

die

Attack
me...
...with

For
ridiculing
you
earlier...

Accepted.
Ready?
Come

No

my

kept
you
alive
The
first
reason
is

Burn
in
Hell,
you

And

That

revenge.
And

She
