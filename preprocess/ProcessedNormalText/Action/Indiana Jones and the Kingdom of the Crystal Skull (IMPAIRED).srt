I
can

You
didn't
know

didn't

fault
I
didn't

to
hurt
you!

of
God,
Didn't

years
ago
He
hated
that
you
ran
away.
Would
you
two

stop?
Yeah,
Marion,
let's
not
let
You're
not

are
you

to

Oxley
back,
and
get
to
Akator
before
What's
he
gonna
do
now?
I
don't

he
plans
that
far
ahead.

Someone
came?
Are

There

Look.
Thirteen

Okay?
Hold

Lovely.
All
