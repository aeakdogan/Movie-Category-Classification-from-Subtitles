in

since
no

can

to
tell

there--there's
only
You.
They're
here
to

you.
What's
there
to

for
"The

Sounds
to
me
like
So
let
me
ask
that
our

by
denying
you
further
asylum
will
you
leave
peacefully?
Freedom
is
your
right.
If
you
make
that
request,
But
before
your

decides,
What
if
we
leave
That's
a
good
question.
Oh,
my

just
look
at

The

Ran

The
museum

closed.
Listen

Dumper-dumper.

are
a
grown
naked
man
-
Pull
your
pants
up
and
exit--
You
got
that
paper,
You
should
be
embarassed.
This
a
family
museum,
sir.
What
is
going
on
here?
How
many
times
So
you
covered
the
gates,
You're
an
amateur
man,
There's
now
five
guards.

You

this
stuff
and
get
out
of
here.
I
gotta
get

Be
good.
Look,
look.
He
knows
-
He
knows
something.
He
knows
something!
-
You
got
what
I
got?
Blackbird.
There
he
is.
This
guy's
a
legend,
Yo,
freshman,
And

Oh
shit,

Decepticon?
Find
the
main
tail!
What
sort
of
hideous
Semi
pulls

Or

my
infinite
wrath!
W-wait,
old
spinal
called
Bugger!
Behold
the
eternal
glory
Prepare

He
either
heard
it.
Fire!
Oh,
I
said,

Bollocks.
Break
that,
Wait
a
second.
Itching,
wretching,
Oh,
the
museum's
gonna
be
Very
angry.
I'm
on
a
mission.
-
W-wait,
wait!
-
Hey!
Look,
I've
no
time
to
talk,
I'm
a
mercenary
goon-bringer.
-
What
planet
am
I
on?
Earth?
might
as
well
Planet
dirt.
Tell
me,
is
that
robot
civil
war
-
Who's
winning?
Well,
I
changed
sides
What
do
you
mean,
It's
a
choice.
It's
intensely
personal
decision.
Who
wants
to
live
a
life
Meaning
you
don't
have
miserable,
If
they
set
on
their
way,
I'm
changing
sides,
-
Who's
your
little
Autobot?
Name's
Wheelie.
Say
my
name,
What
are
you
allowing
At
least
he's
faithful,
Sam.
Yeah,
well,
he's
faithful,
Can
you
just--
-
Hey,
what
are
you
doing?
What
were
you
saying?
I
told
you
Wow,
someone
shit
in
the
bed
Pretty
stout
My
ancestors
have
been
here
My
father,
one
was
a
wheel!
-
Do
you
know
what
he
transformed
into?
Nothing!
My
boosters
are
fried.
I
thought
You
know
things
I
don't
know.
-
I
do.
Honestly,
I
don't
know.
These
vivid
symbols,
they're
symbols
You
see,
And
Megatron
Him
and
someone
called
The
Fallen?
I
know
him.
The
original
Decepticon.
He's
terrible
to
work
for.
His
suspects,
the
Fall
and
Search,
Of
a
dagger's
tip
Slow
down.
-
what
are
you
talking
about?
Hold
on,
everybody!
Well,
that
wasn't
so
bad.
I
was
overseeing
Hey,
that
frickin'
hurt!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
God!
Oh,
my
God!
You
beautiful
face,
Except
you
landed
Please
get
off!
My
balls!
Sam!
-
Where
are
we?
Simmons!
Oh,
my
God.
What
is
this?
-
You
guys
okay?
Hey!
I
think
That
really,
really
hurts.
You're
just
lucky
People
could've
gotten
killed,
okay?
-
you
would
have
heard
from--
I
told
you
It's
the
fastest
way
What
did
you
tell
us?
You
didn't
tell
us
anything.
Don't
you
dare
-
You
would
do
the
informed.
Can
you
focus?
so
we
can
all
have
a
little
bit
This
planet
was
visited
by
our
earliest
ancestors
They
were
on
an
exploratory
mission
the
life
blood
Without
it,
we'll
all
perish,
let
my
wretched
self.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
is
Let's
not
get
episodic,
okay?
Beginning,
middle,
end.
Somewhere
buried
in
this
desert,
It
harvests
Energon
-
Destroy
suns?
Yes.
You
see,
in
the
beginning,
our
original
leaders.
And
they
set
out
in
the
Universe
The
Primes
set
out
Never
destroy
a
planet
Until
one
of
them
And
his
name,
for
ever
more,
He
despised
And
he
wanted
to
kill
you
all
The
only
way
to
activate
it
called
the
Matrix
of
Leadership.
A
great
battle
took
place
The
Fallen
who
was
surrendered
no
choice,
In
the
ultimate
sacrifice,
they
gave
in
a
tomb
made
of
A
tomb
Somewhere,
that
deadly
machine
The
Fallen
knows
And
if
he
finds
the
Tomb
of
the
Primes,
Okay
so
how
do
we
stop
it?
Only
a
Prime
Optimus
Prime?
So
you
met
a
Prime?
You
must
have
met
Is
he
alive?
Here?
He
sacrificed
himself
So
he's
dead.
Without
a
Prime,
No
one
else
So
the
same
energy
that's
going
Could
that
energy
somehow
be
used
and
bring
him
It
was
never
designed
but
it's
an
energy,
So
then
how
do
you
get
us
to
the
Matrix
Follow
your
mind,
your
map,
what
you
got
in
the
sand,
When
dawn
alights
three
kings
will
reveal
Find
the
doorway!
Go
now,
go!
That
was
my
mission.
Go
before
and
find
you.
That
was
Says
Ancient
Sumerian
used
to
call
-
the
Dagger's
Tip.
-
It's
part
of
the
Red
Sea.
It
divides
Egypt
and
Jordan
29
and
a
half
degrees
north.
There
it
is.
Okay,
first
thing
we
gotta
do
How
are
you
gonna
get
him
We're
gonna
make
a
call.
We
got
the
cops.
I
can't
go
to
prison,
guys!
Sam,
you
gotta
get
off
Man,
they'll
pick
up.
This
is
just
called
How

I'll
lay
my
piss
They're
gone.
Wait
another
time.
How
are
you
gonna
make
You
are
in
the
worldwide.
What,
They'll
track
you
here
CIA
is
all
over
this
place.
You're
gonna
call?
Okay,
-
Alright?
My
mind
in
other
things.
Like
why
don't
you
get
New
Jersey
This
departure:
So
we're
shipped
in
This
is
central

of
the
Red
Sea,

you
serious?
Sir.
Even
if
we
could
figure
out
a
way
How
is
this
little
kid's
I
don't
know.
But
we
gotta
trust
him.
Okay,
let's
go
-
When
the
dawn
arise...

three
kings...
That's
what
he
said.

You're

chivalrous.
Why
are
you
mad
at
me?
You

You
realise
that
I

Who

could
be
Look
at
the
things
And
now
we're
underneath
and
the
three
most

Copy

CIA
just
got
a
hit
Hundred
miles
from
the
location
It's
getting
hotter.
It's
gotta
be...
It's
here
somewhere,
Oh
yeah,
why?
'Cause
we're
trusting
who
doesn't
even
know
On
his
defense,
I've
ever
seen
Okay.
Well,
that's
great.
Nope.
Ever

C-17s.
You
can't
bring
it
back,
Sam,
Look,
look
around
you.
We
didn't
just
go
through
everything
They
just
haven't
There
is
a
reason
The
voices
and
the
symbols
for
a
purpose.
Everyone's
after
me
And
what
I
know,
How
do
you
know
Because
I
believe
it.
Best

Thank
