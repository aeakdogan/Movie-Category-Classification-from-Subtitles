Did
you
hear
that?
They
shut
down
the
main
reactor.
We'll
be
destroyed
for
sure.
This
is
madness.


We're
doomed.

There'll
be
no
escape

What's
that?

R2-D2,
where
are
you?

At
last!
Where
have
you
been?
They're
heading
in
this
direction.
What
are
we
going
to
do?
We'll
be
sent
to
smashed
into
who
knows
what!
Wait
a
minute.
The
Death
Star
plans
Where
are
those
transmissions
What
have
you
done
with
those
plans?
We
intercepted
no
transmissions.
This
is
a
consular
ship.
We're
on
a
diplomatic
mission.
If
this
is
a
consular
ship...
where
is
the
ambassador?
Commander,
tear
this
ship
apart
and
bring
me
the
passengers!
There's
one.
Set
for
stun.
She'll
be
all
right.
Inform
Lord
Vader
we
have
a
prisoner.
Hey!
You're
not
permitted
in
there.
You'll
be
deactivated
for
sure.

Don't
you
call
me
you
overweight
glob
of
grease!
Now
come
out
before

Secret
mission?
What
are
you
talking
about?
I'm
not
getting
in
there.
I'm
going
to
regret
this.
There
goes
another
one.
Hold
your
fire.
It
must
have
short-circuited.
That's
funny.
The
damage
Are
you
sure
this
thing
is
safe?

Oh.
Darth
Vader.
The
Imperial
Senate

they

so
surprised,

mission
to
Alderaan.
You

Alliance
Take
her
away!
Holding
her
is
dangerous.
If
word
of
this
gets
out...
it
could
generate
sympathy
I've
traced
the
rebel
spies
to
her.
Now
she
is
my
only

She'll
die
before
Leave
that

then

Yes,
sir.
How
did
we
get
into
this
mess?
I
really
don't
know
how.
We
seem
to
be
made
to
suffer.
It's
our
lot
in
life.

I've
got
to
rest
before
I
fall
apart.
My
joints
are
almost
frozen.
What
a
desolate
place
this
is!

Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
Well,
I'm
not
going
that
way.
It's
much
too
rocky.
This
way
is
much
easier.
What
makes
you
think...
there
are
settlements
over
there?

Don't
get
technical
with
me.
What
mission?

I've
just
about
had
enough
of
you.
Go
that
way.
You'll
be
malfunctioning
within
a
day...
you
nearsighted
scrap
pile.
And
don't
let
me
catch
you
because
you
won't
get
it.


No
more
adventures.
I'm
not
going
that
way.
That
malfunctioning
little
twerp.
This
is
all
his
fault.
He
tricked
me
into
going
this
way...
but
he'll
do
no
better.
Wait!
What's
that?
A
transport.
I'm
saved!
Over
here!
Hey!
Hey!
Help!
Please
help!







R2?

R2-D2,
it
is
you!
It
is
you!

Someone
was
in
the
pod.
The
tracks
go
off
in
this
direction.
Look,
sir,
droids.
We
stopped.
Wake
up!
Wake
up!

We're
doomed.

Do
you
think
they'll
melt
us
down?

Don't
shoot!
Will
this
never
end?

All
right,
fine.
Let's
go.
Woman:
Luke!
Luke!
Luke,
tell
Uncle
be
sure
it
speaks
Bocce.
Doesn't
look
like
we
have
much
-

No,
not
that
one.

I
suppose
you're
programmed
Protocol?
Why,
it's
I
am
well-versed
in
all
the
customs...
I
have
no
need
for
a
protocol
droid.
Of
course
you
haven't,
sir.
Not
in
an
environment
such
as
this.
That
is
why
I
have
What
I
really
need
is
the
binary
language
Vaporators?
Sir,
my
first
job
very
similar
to
your
vaporators
Very
similar
to
your
vaporators
Can
you
speak
Bocce?
Of
course
I
can,
sir.
Yeah,
all
right.
Shut
up.
Luke!
Take
these
two
over
I
want
them
cleaned
up
before
dinner.
But
I
was
going
into
Tosche
Station...
to
pick
up
some
power
converters.
You
can
waste
time
when
your
chores
are
done.
Now
come
on.
Get
to
it.
All
right.
Come
on.

And
the
red
one.
Come
on.

Well,
come
on,
red.
Let's
go.

Uncle
Owen!
Yeah?
This
R2
unit
has
Hey,
what
are
you

Excuse
me,
sir...
but
that
R2
unit
is
in
prime
condition,
Uncle
Owen,
what
about
that
one?
What
about
that
blue
one?
We'll
take
that
one.
Take
this
away.
You'll
be
very
pleased
He
really
is
in
first-class
condition.
I've
worked
with
him
before.
Here
he
comes.

O.K.
Let's
go.
Now,
don't
you
forget
this.
Why
I
should
stick
is
quite
beyond
my
capacity.

Thank
the
maker!
This
oil
bath
is
going
to
feel
so
good.
I've
got
such
a
bad
case
I
can
barely
move.
It
just
isn't
fair.
Oh,
Biggs
is
right.
I'm
never
gonna
get
out
of
here.
Is
there
anything
I
might
do
to
help?
No.
Not
unless
you
can
alter
time...
speed
up
the
harvest,
I
don't
think
so,
sir.
I'm
only
a
droid...
and
not
very
knowledgeable
not
on
this
planet,
anyway.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
Well,
if
there's
you're
on
the
planet
I
see,
sir.
You
can
call
me
Luke.
I
see,
Sir
Luke.
Ha
ha.
Just
Luke.
Oh...
And
I
am
C-3PO,
This
is
my
counterpart...
R2-D2.
Hello.

You
got
a
lot
of
carbon
scoring.
Looks
like
you
boys
have
With
all
we've
been
through...
sometimes
I'm
amazed
we're
in
what
with
the
rebellion
and
all.
You
know
of
the
rebellion
That's
how
we
came
if
you
take
my
meaning,
sir.
Have
you
been
in
many
battles?
Several,
I
think.
Actually,
there's
not
much
to
tell.
I'm
not
much
more
and
not
very
good
at
telling
stories.
Well,
not
at
making
them
Well,
my
little
friend...
you
got
something
jammed
Were
you
on
a
Starcruiser
or...
Help
me,
Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
What's
this?
"What
is
what"?
What
is
that?
Help
me,
Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
You're
my
only
hope.
Help
me,
Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
You're
my
only
hope.

He
says
it's
nothing,
sir,
Old
data.
Pay
it
no
mind.
Who
is
she?
I'm
afraid
I'm
not
quite
sure,
sir.
I
think
she
was
a
passenger
A
person
of
some
importance,
I
believe.
Our
captain
was
attached...
Is
there
any
more

Behave
yourself,
R2.
You're
going
to
get
us
into
trouble.
It's
all
right.
You
can
trust
him.

He
says
that
he's
the
property
a
resident
of
these
parts...
and
it's
a
private
message
for
him.
Quite
frankly,
sir,
I
don't
know
what
Our
last
master
But
with
all
this
little
R2
unit
has
Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
I
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
but
do
you
know
I
don't
know
any
Obi-Wan...
but
old
Ben
lives
out
He's
kind
of
a
strange
old
hermit.
Help
me,
I
wonder
who
she
is.
Sounds
like
she's
in
trouble.
I
better
play
back
the
whole
thing.

He
says
the
restraining
bolt...
has
short-circuited
He
suggests
that
if
you
remove
the
bolt...
he
might
be
able
to
play
Oh,
yeah.
Well...
I
guess
you're
too
small
if
I
take
this
off.
O.
K...
There
you
go.
Wait
a
minute.
Bring
her
back.
"What
message"?
The
one
you've
just
been
playing!
The
one
you're
carrying
Woman:
Luke!
Luke!
All
right,
I'll
be
right
there,
Aunt
Beru.
I'm
sorry,
sir...
but
he
appears
to
have
Here.
See
what
you
can
do
with
him.
I'll
be
right
back.

Just
you
reconsider
playing

No,
I
don't
think
he
likes
you
at
all.
No,
I
don't
like
you,
either.

You
know,
I
think
that
R2
unit
What
makes
you
think
that?
Well,
I
stumbled
across
a
recording
He
says
he
belongs
to
someone
I
thought
he
might
have
meant
old
Ben.
Do
you
know
what
Mm-mm.
I
wonder
if
he's
related
to
Ben.
That
wizard's
just
a
crazy
old
man.
Tomorrow,
I
want
you
to
take
and
have
its
memory
erased.
That'll
be
the
end
of
it.
But
what
if
this
Obi-Wan
He
won't.
I
don't
think
he
exists
any
more.
He
died
about
the
same
time
He
knew
my
father?
I
told
you
to
forget
it.
Your
only
concern
is
to
prepare
In
the
morning,
I
want
them
working
on
those
condensers.
Yes,
sir.
I
think
those
new
droids
In
fact,
I,
uh,
was
also
thinking
about
me
staying
on
another
season?
And
if
these
new
droids
I
want
to
transmit
my
application
You
mean
the
next
semester
Sure.
There's
more
Harvest
is
when
I
need
you
the
most.
It's
only
one
season
more.
This
year
we'll
make
that
I'll
be
able
and
then
you
can
go
You
must
understand
But
it's
a
whole
'nother
year!
Look,
it's
only
one
more
season.
Yeah,
that's
what
you
said
Where
are
you
going?
Looks
like
I'm
going
nowhere.
I
have
to
go
finish
Owen,
he
can't
stay
here
forever.
Most
of
his
friends
have
gone.
It
means
so
much
to
him.
I'll
make
it
up
to
him
next
year.
I
promise.
Luke's
just
not
a
farmer,
Owen.
He
has
too
much
of
his
father
in
him.
That's
what
I'm
afraid
of.
Ooh!
What
are
you
doing
It
wasn't
my
fault,
sir.
I
told
him
not
to
go,
Kept
babbling
on
about
his
mission.
Oh,
no.
That
R2
unit
has
always
These
astrodroids
Even
I
can't
understand
How
could
I
be
so
stupid?
He's
nowhere
in
sight.
Blast
it!
Pardon
me,
sir,
It's
too
dangerous
We'll
have
to
wait
until
morning.
Uncle
Owen:
All
right!
Boy,
am
I
gonna
get
it.
That
little
droid's
going
to
Oh,
he
excels
at
that,
sir.
Come
on.
Luke?
Luke!
Luke!
Have
you
seen
Luke
this
morning?
He
said
he
had
some
things
to
do
so
he
left
early.
Did
he
take
those
I
think
so.
Well,
he
better
have
those
units
repaired
by
midday,
Lookit,
there's
a
droid
on
the
scanner.
Dead
ahead.
It
might
be
our
little
R2
unit.

Hey,
whoa!
Where
do

Master
Luke
is
your
rightful
owner
now.
We'll
have
no
more

And
don't
talk
to
me
You're
fortunate
he
doesn't
blast
you...
into
a
million
pieces
right
here!
No.
It's
all
right,

What's
wrong
with
him
now?
There
are
several
creatures
Sandpeople,
or
worse.
Come
on.
Come
on!
Well,
there
are
but
I
don't
see
any...
They're
Sandpeople,
all
right.
I
can
see
one
of
them
now.



Hello,
there.

Come
here,
my
little
friend.

Oh,
don't
worry.
Rest
easy,
son.
You're
fortunate
Ben?
Ben
Kenobi?
Boy,
am
I
glad
to
see
you.
The
Jundland
Wastes
are
not

Tell
me,
young
Luke...
what
brings
you
out
this
far?
This
little
droid.

I
think
he's
searching
but
I've
never
seen
such
devotion
He
claims
to
be
the
property...
of
an
Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
Is
he
a
relative
of
yours?
Do
you
know
who
Obi-Wan
Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now,
that's
a
name
A
long
time.
I
think
my
uncle
knows
him.
He
said
he
was
dead.
Oh,
he's
not
dead.
Not
yet.
You
know
him?
Well,
of
course
I
know
him.

I
haven't
gone
by
the
name
of
Obi-Wan...
since,
oh,
before
you
were
born.
Well,
then
the
droid
I
don't
seem
to
remember
Very
interesting.

I
think
we
better
get
indoors.
The
Sandpeople
are
easily
startled...
but
they'll
soon
be
back,

3PO.
Where
am
I?
Can
you
stand?
We've
got
to
get
out
of
here
before
I
don't
think
I
can
make
it.
There's
no
sense
in
you
risking
yourself
I'm
done
for.
Luke:
No,
you're
not.
What
kind
of
talk
is
that?
Quickly.
They're
on
the
move.
No,
my
father
didn't
He
was
a
navigator
That's
what
your
uncle
told
you.
He
didn't
hold
Thought
he
should
and
not
gotten
involved.
You
fought
in
the
Clone
Wars?
Yes.
I
was
once
a
Jedi
knight...
the
same
as
your
father.
I
wish
I'd
known
him.
He
was
the
best
starpilot
in
the
galaxy...
and
a
cunning
warrior.
I
understand
you've
become...
quite
a
good
pilot
yourself.
And
he
was
a
good
friend.
Which
reminds
me...
I
have
something
here
for
you.
Your
father
wanted
you
to
have
this...
when
you
were
old
enough...
but
your
uncle
He
feared
you
might
on
some
damn-fool
like
your
father
did.
Sir,
if
you'll
not
be
needing
me...
I'll
close
down
for
a
while.
Sure.
Go
ahead.
What
is
it?
It's
your
father's
lightsabre.
This
is
the
weapon
of
a
Jedi
knight.
Not
as
clumsy
or
random
An
elegant
weapon
For
over
a
thousand
generations...
the
Jedi
knights
were
the
guardians...
of
peace
and
justice
before
the
dark
times...
before
the
Empire.
How
did
my
father
die?
Ayoung
Jedi
named
Darth
Vader...
who
was
a
pupil
of
mine
helped
the
Empire
hunt
down
He
betrayed
and
Now
the
Jedi
are
all
but
extinct.
Vader
was
seduced
The
Force?
The
Force
is
what
gives
It's
an
energy
field
created
It
surrounds
us,
penetrates
us...
it
binds
the
galaxy
together.

Now
let's
see
if
we
can't
figure
out
and
where
you
come
from.
I
saw
part
of
a
message
he
was...
I
seem
to
have
found
it.
General
Kenobi,
years
ago
Now
he
begs
you
to
help
him...
in
his
struggle
against
the
Empire.
I
regret
that
I
am
unable
to
present
But
my
ship
has
fallen
under
attack...
and
I
am
afraid
my
mission
I
have
placed
information...
vital
to
the
survival
into
the
memory
systems
My
father
will
know
You
must
see
this
droid...
safely
delivered
to
him
on
Alderaan.
This
is
our
most
desperate
hour.
Help
me,
Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
You
must
learn
if
you're
to
come
Alderaan?
I've
got
to
get
home.
It's
late.
I
need
your
help,
Luke.
I'm
getting
too
old
I
can't
get
involved.
I've
got
work
to
do.
It's
not
that
I
like
the
Empire.
but
there's
nothing
It's
all
such
a
long
way
from
here.
That's
your
uncle
talking.
My
uncle.
How
am
I
ever
gonna
explain
this?
Learn
about
the
Force,
Luke.
Look,
I
can
take
you
You
can
get
a
transport
there
to
You
must
do
what
you
feel
Until
this
battle
station
we
are
vulnerable.

They're

dangerous
Dangerous

battle
station.
The

The

I
have
just
received

That's
impossible.
How
will
the

The
regional
governors

Fear
will
keep
fear
of
this

station.
And
what
of
the
rebellion?
If
the
rebels
have
obtained...
a
complete
technical
readout
it
is
possible,
however
unlikely...
that
they
might
find

refer
to

Any

by
the

Come

Hey!
We

What?
Your

We
don't
want
them

Why
don't

We
don't

I
heartily
agree
with

Uh...
I'll

I'm

I

You'll

You

Look,
Jabba,
You

I
had

But
I

Tarkin.

have
expected...
to
find
you
holding

recognized
your
foul
stench...
when
I
was
brought
on
board.
Charming
to
the
last.
You
don't
know
signing
the
order
I'm
surprised
you
had
the
courage...
to
take
the
responsibility
yourself.

I
would
like
you
to
be
my

to
provide

have
chosen
to
test

on
your
home
planet
of
Alderaan.
No!
Alderaan
is
peaceful.
We
have
no
weapons.
You
would
prefer
another
target?
Then
name
the
system.
I
grow
tired
of
asking
this,
Where
is
the
rebel
base?
Dantooine.
They're
on
Dantooine.
There.
You
see,
Lord
Vader?
She
can
be
reasonable.
Continue
with
the
operation.
What?
You're
far
too
trusting.
Dantooine
is
too
remote...
to
make
an
effective
demonstration,
We
will
deal
with
your
rebel
friends
No!
Commence

Are
you
all
right?
I
felt
a
great
disturbance
as
if
millions
of
voices...
suddenly
cried
out
in
terror...
and
were
suddenly
silenced.
I
fear
something
terrible
You'd
better
get
on
Well,
you
can
forget
your
troubles
I
told
you
I'd
outrun
them.
Don't
everybody
thank
me
at
once.
Anyway,
we
should
be
at
Alderaan
Now
be
careful,
R2.
Argh!
He
made
a
fair
move.
Let
him
have
it.
It's
not
wise
But,
sir,
nobody
worries
That's
'cause
a
droid
don't
pull
when
they
lose.
Wookiees
are
known
to
do
that.
Grrr...
I
see
your
point,
sir.
I
suggest
a
new
strategy,
R2.
Let
the
Wookiee
win.
Argh!
Remember,
a
Jedi
can
feel

You
mean
it
controls
your
actions?
Partially,

down,
How
am
I
supposed
to
fight?
Your
eyes
can
deceive
you.
Don't
trust
them.
Stretch
out
with
your
feelings.
You
see?
You
can
do
it.
Han:
I
call
it
luck.
In
my
experience,
Look,

Good
against
the
living,

Looks

Cut

What
the...
Arrghh
arrgh!
We've
come
out
of

Some
kind
of

collision.
It's
not

any

What's
going
on?
Our
position's
correct,

you
mean?
That's
what
I'm
trying
It
ain't
there.
It's
What?
How?
Destroyed

the
Empire.
The
entire
starfleet
couldn't
destroy
It
would
take
1,000
ships

There's
another
ship
coming
in.
Maybe
they
know
what
happened.
It's
an
imperial
fighter.
It
followed
us!
No.
It's
a
short-range
fighter.
There
aren't
any
bases
around
here.
It
sure
is
leaving
in
a
big
hurry.
If
they
identify
us,
Not

can

it.
Chewie,
jam
its

It
would
be
as
well
to

it
go.
It's
