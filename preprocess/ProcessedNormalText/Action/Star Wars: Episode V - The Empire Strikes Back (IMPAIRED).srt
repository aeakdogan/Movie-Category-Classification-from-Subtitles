lord.
What
is
thy
bidding,
There
is
a
great
in
the
Force.
I
have
felt
it.
We
have
the
young
rebel
I
have
no
doubt
is
the
offspring
How
is
that
possible?
Search
your
feelings,
You
will
know
it
He
could
destroy
us.
He's
just
a
boy.
Obi-Wan
can
no
longer
The
Force
The
son
of
Skywalker...
must
not
become
a
Jedi.
If
he
could
be
turned...
he
would
become
Yes.
He
would
be
Can
it
be
done?
He
will
join
us
Look,
I
just
don't
understand
Patience!
For
the
Jedi...
it
is
time
Hmm?
Heh
heh.
Eat,
eat.
Hot!
Good
food!
How
far
away
is
Yoda?
Not
far.
Patience.
Soon
you
Root
leaf.
I
cook.
Why
wish
you
Mostly
because
of
Ah,
father.
Powerful
Jedi
was
he.
Hee
hee.
Oh,
come
on.
How
could
you
You
don't
I
don't
even
know
We're
wasting
our
time!
I
cannot
teach
him.
The
boy
He
will
learn
patience.
Hmm...
Much
anger
in
him...
like
his
father.
Was
I
any
different
No.
He
is
not
ready.
Yoda.
I
am
ready.
Ben...
Ben,
tell
him
I'm...
Ready,
are
you?
What
know
you
ready?
For
800
years
My
own
counsel
will
I
keep...
on
who
is
to
be
trained.
A
Jedi
must
have
The
most
serious
mind.
This
one
a
long
time
All
his
life
to
the
future,
Never
his
mind
hmm?
What
he
was
doing.
Hmph!
Adventure.
Ha!
Excitement.
Ha!
A
Jedi
craves
You
are
reckless!
So
was
I,
He
is
too
old.
Yes,
too
old
to
But
I've
learned
so
much.
Ahh...
Will
he
finish
I
won't
fail
you.
I'm
not
afraid.
Oh...
You
will
be.
You
will
be.

Aah!
Sir,
if
I
may
venture
I'm
not
really
interested
There's
something
Where?
Outside
in
the
cave.

There
it
is.
I'm
going
out
there.
Are
you
crazy?
I
just
got
this
bucket
I'm
not
going
to
let
Then
I'm
going
I
think
it
might
-
if
I
stay
behind
and
guard
the
ship.
Oh,
no.
Leia:
This
ground
It
doesn't
Han:
There's
an
awful
lot
Leia:
I
don't
know.
I
have
a
bad
feeling
Yeah.
Watch
out!
It's
all
right.
It's
all
right.
Yeah,
that's
what
Chewie,
check
the
rest
and
make
sure
there
are
chewing
Mynocks.
Go
on
inside.
We'll
clean
them
off
Han!
Aagghh!
Go
away,
go
away,
Shoo!
Shoo!
Wait
a
minute...
Let's
get
out
of
here!
The
Empire
is
still
out
there!
No
time
to
discuss
this
I'm
not
a
committee!
You
can't
make
the
jump
to
light
speed
Sit
down,
sweetheart!
Look!
I
see
it.
3PO:
We're
doomed!
Leia:
The
cave
is
collapsing.
-
This
is
no
cave.
Run!
Yes!
A
Jedi's
strength
But
beware
Anger,
fear,
The
dark
side
of

If
once
you

down
forever

it

Consume

as
it
did
Obi-Wan's
Vader.
Is
the
dark

No,
no.
No.
Quicker,
easier,
How

I
know
the

side
You
will

A
Jedi

knowledge
never
for

But
tell
me
why
No,
no.
Nothing

Clear
your

Hmm...
Mmm...
There's
something
I
feel
cold...
death.
That
place...
is
strong
with
A
domain
of
evil
it
is.
In
you
must
go.
What's
in
there?
Only
what
Your

you
will
not

Hmph...
Bounty

We
don't

My

Oh,
thank
goodness

field.
Han:
Let's
get
out
of
here.
Ready
for
light
speed?

2...
3!
It's
not
fair.
Gahhh!
Transfer
circuits
It's
not
my
fault!
No
light

It's
not
my
fault.
Sir,
we've
just
lost
One
more

I'm

They're

Track

Well,
there's
no

Captain,
Lord

Get
a

I
shall
assume
full
responsibility
and
apologize
Meanwhile,
continue
Yes,
Captain
Needa.
Use
the
Force.
Yes.
Now,
the
stone...
Feel
it.

Concentrate!
Oh,
no.
We'll
never
So
certain
are
you.

Always
with
you
Hear
you
nothing
Master,
moving
stones
around
This
is
totally
No!
No
different!
Only
different
You
must
unlearn
All
right.
No!
Try
not.
Do.
Or
do
not.
There
is
no
try.

I
can't.
Size
matters
not.
Judge
me
by
my
size,
Hmm?
Hmph!
And
well
you
should
not...
for
my
ally
is
the
Force.
And
a
powerful
Life
creates
it...
makes
it
grow.
Its
energy
surrounds
us...
and
binds
us.
Luminous
beings
are
we...
not
this
crude
matter.
You
must
feel
Here,
the
tree...
the
rock...
everywhere!
Yes...
even
between
the
land
You
want
the
impossible.

Mm...
I
don't...
I
don't
believe
it.
That
is
why
you
fail.
Apology
accepted,
Lord
Vader,
our
ships
have
completed
If
the

Alert

Yes,
my
lord.
Don't
fail
me
again...
Admiral.
Alert
all

Deploy

Captain

Gahhh!
I
will
not
be
quiet.
The

Go
back
and
stand
by
for
the

claw.
I
really
don't
see
Surrender
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
The
Empire
Thank
you.
What's
your
next
move?
If
they
follow
standard
they'll
dump
their
garbage...
before
they
go
to
and
then
we
just
With
the
rest
Then
what?
Then
we
got
to
find
a
safe
port
Any
ideas?
Where
are
we?
The
Anoat
system.
There's
not
No.
Well,
wait.
Lando.
Lando
system?
Lando's
not
a
system.
He's
a
cardplayer,
You'd
like
him.
Thanks.
Bespin.
It's
pretty
far,
A
mining
colony?
Yeah,
a
tibanna
Lando
conned
We
go
back
a
long
way,
Can
you
trust
him?
No.
But
he's
got
no
I
can
tell
you
that.
Here
we
go,
Chewie.
Detach.
You
do
have
your
moments.
Not
many
of
them...
but
you
do
have
them.

Concentrate.
Feel
the
Force
flow.
Yes.



Good.
Calm.
Yes.
Through
the
Force,
Other
places.
Old
friends
long
gone.
Han?
Leia!

Hmm...
Control,
control.
You
must
learn
control!

I
saw...
I
saw
a
city
Hmm...
Friends
you
have
there.
They
were
in
pain.
It
is
the
future
you
see.
Future?
Will
they
die?
Difficult
to
see.
Always
in
motion
I've
got
to
go
to
them.
Decide
you
must
If
you
leave
now,
but
you
would
destroy
all...
for
which
they
have
No,
I
don't
have
I'm
trying
to
reach
Wait
a
minute!
You
will
not
deviate
3PO:
Rather
touchy,
I
thought
Gaah!
That
was
I'm
sure
he's
forgotten
about
that.
Permission
granted
to
land
Thank
you.
Nothing
We
go
way
back,
Who's
worried?
3PO:
Oh.
No
one
to
meet
us.
I
don't
like
this.
Well,
what
They
did
let
us
land.
Look,
don't
worry.
Trust
me.
See?
My
friend.
Keep
your
eyes
Gahhh!
Hey!
Why,
you
slimy...
double-crossing,
You've
got
a
lot
of
guts
coming
here...
after
what
you
pulled.
Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
How
you
doin',
you
old
pirate?
Well,
he
seems
Yes.
Very
friendly.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Ah,
repairs.
What
have
you
done
Your
ship?
Hey,
remember...
you
lost
her
to
me
And
how
you
doin',
Gahh!
You
still
hanging
around
Gahhh!
Hello.
Welcome,
I'm
the
administrator
And
who
might
you
be?
Leia.
Welcome,
Leia.
All
right,
all
right,
Hello,
sir.
I
am
C-3PO,
My
facilities
Well,
really!
What's
wrong
Hyperdrive.
I'll
get
my
people
That
ship
saved
my
life
She's
the
fastest
How's
the
gas
mine?
Not
as
well
as
I'd
like.
We're
a
small
outpost
I've
had
supply
problems
I've
had
labor
difficulties.
Ha
ha
ha!
What's
so
funny?
You.
Listen
to
you.
You
sound
like
a
responsible
leader.
Who'd
have
Seeing
you
brings
back
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm
responsible
It's
the
price
you
pay...
for
being
successful.
Ooh.
Nice
to
see
E
chu
ta!
How
rude!

That
sounds
like
I
wonder
if...
Hello?
How
interesting.
Who
are
you?
Oh,
my!
I...
I
didn't
mean
No,
please
don't
get
up.
Gahhh.
Luke,
you
must
complete
I
can't
keep
the
vision
They're
my
friends.
You
must
not
go.
But
Han
and
Leia
will
die
You
don't
know
that.
Even
Yoda
cannot
But
I
can
help
them.
I
feel
the
Force.
But
you
cannot
This
is
a
dangerous
when
you
will
be
tempted
Yes!
Yes!
The
cave.
But
I've
learned
Master
Yoda,
I
promise
to
return
You
have
my
word.
It
is
you
the
emperor
wants.
That
is
why
your
friends
That's
why
Luke,
I
don't
want
the
way
I
lost
Vader.
You
won't.
Stopped
they
must
be.
On
this
all
depends.
Only
a
fully
trained
with
the
Force
will
conquer
Vader
If
you
end
if
you
choose
the
quick
and
easy
path,
you
will
become
Patience.
And
sacrifice
If
you
honor
what
they
fight
for...
yes.
If
you
choose
to
face
Vader...
you
will
do
it
alone.
I
cannot
interfere.
I
understand.
R2.

Fire
up
the
converters.
Luke!
Don't
give
in
to
hate.
That
leads
to
the
dark
side.
Strong
is
Vader.
Mind
what
you
have
learned.
I
will.
And
I'll
return.
I
promise.
Told
you,
I
did.
Reckless
is
he.
Now...
matters
are
worse.
That
boy
No,
there
is
another.
The
ship's
almost
finished.
Two
or
three
more
things
The
sooner
the
better.
No
one
has
seen
or
knows
He's
been
gone
too
long
Relax.
and
see
what
I
don't
trust
Lando.
Well,
I
don't
But
he
is
my
friend.
we'll
soon
be
gone.
Then
you're
as
good
as
gone,
Gaahh!
What
happened?
Gahhh
gahhh.
Where?
Gahhh!
Found
him
Oh,
what
a
mess.
Gahhh!
Lando's
got
people
No,
thanks.
I'm
sorry,
am
I
Not
really.
You
look
You
truly
belong
here
Thank
you.
Would
you
join
me
Everyone's
invited,
Having
trouble
No,
no
problem.
Why?
You
see,
since
we're
we
don't
fall
into...
the
jurisdiction
So
you're
part
of
No,
not
actually.
Our
operation
Which
is
advantageous
since
our
customers
attracting
attention
Aren't
you
afraid
about
this
little
operation,
It's
always
been
a
danger
that
looms
But
things
have
developed
I've
just
made
a
deal
that
will
We
would
be
honored
I
had
no
choice.
They
arrived
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry,
too.
Gahhh.

No,
3PO's
with
them.
Just
hang
on.

Gahhh!
Gahhh!

Oh
ah
ooh
ah.
Im

I

No!
Secret.
Here?
I
must
Oh,
no,
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaaaahhh!
Lord
Vader.
You
may
take
Captain
Solo
after
I
have
Skywalker.
He's
no
good
to
me
dead.
He
will
not
be
Aaaahhh!
Lord
Vader,
what
about
Leia
They
must
never
again
That
was
never
a
condition
nor
was
giving
Han
Perhaps
you
think
you're
No.
Good.
It
would
be
if
I
had
to
leave
This
deal
is
getting
worse
all
the
time.
Oh,
yes,
that's
very
good.
Oh!
Something's
not
right
Oh,
oh,
oh,
Wait!
Wait!
Oh,
my!
I'm
backwards...
you
flea-bitten
Only
an
overgrown
would
be
I
feel
terrible.
Gahhh.
Why
are
they
They
never
even
asked
me
Lando.
Grrr!
Han:
Get
out
of
here,
Lando.
Shut
up
and
listen!
Vader's
agreed
They'll
have
to
stay
here,
Leia:
Vader's
given
him
Vader
wants
us
He
doesn't
want
you
at
all.
He's
after
somebody
-
Luke.
And
we're
the
bait!
He's
on
his
way.
You
fixed
us
all
My
friend.
Stop!
I've
done
all
I
can.
I'm
sorry
but
I've
got
Yeah.
You're
a
real
hero.
You
certainly
have
Ah...
Ah...
This
facility
is
crude...
but
it
should
be
adequate
for
his
journey
to
the
emperor.
Lord
Vader,
ship
approaching,
Good.
and
allow
him
Lord
Vader,
we
only
use
this
facility
You
put
him
in
there,
I
do
not
want...
the
emperor's
prize
We
will
test
it
If
only
you'd
I
wouldn't
be
Now
remember,
you
have
a
responsibility
for
me...
so
don't
do
anything
foolish.
What's
going
on...
buddy?
You're
being

What
if
he
doesn't
survive?
The
Empire
if
he
dies.
Put
him
in.
Rrrah!
Rrrah!
Rrrah!
Han:
Stop,
Chewie,
3PO:
Yes,
stop,
please!
Hey!
Hey!
Listen
This
won't
help
me.
Hey,
save
your
strength.
There
will
be
The
princess...
You
have
to
Do
you
hear
me?
Gahhh...
I
love
you.
I
know.
Gahhh!
What's
going
on?
Chewbacca,
Gahhh.
Oh,
they've
encased
him
He
should
be
quite
if
he
survived
the
freezing
process,
Well,
Calrissian,
Yes,
he's
alive.
And
in
perfect
hibernation.
He's
all
yours,
Reset
the
chamber
Skywalker
has
Good.
See
to
it
Calrissian,
take
the
princess
You
said
they'd
be
left
in
the
city
I
am
altering
the
deal.
Pray
I
don't



Gahhh!
Luke!
Luke,
don't,
It's
a
trap!

The
Force
is
with
you,
But
you
are
not
Well
done.
Hold
them
And
keep
it
quiet.
Move.
What

We're

I
knew
all
along.
Do
you
think
that
after
what
you
did
Grrr!
I
had
no
choice.
What
are
you
doing?
We
understand,
don't
we,
I'm
just
We
don't
need
Haaa...
Grrr!

It
sounds
like
Han.
There's
still
to

Chewie.
I'm
terribly
sorry
After
all,
Put
Captain
Solo

R2,
R2,
where
have
you
been?
Wait.
Turn
around,
you
woolly...
Hurry!
Hurry!
We're
trying
to
save
Han
Well,
at
least
you're
still
in
one
piece.
Look
what's
happened
to
me.
Oh,
no!
Chewie,
You
have
learned
You'll
find
Your
destiny
lies
Obi-Wan
knew
this
No.
Aaah!
All
too
easy.
Perhaps
you're
as
the
emperor
thought.
Impressive.
Most
impressive.
Aaah!
Obi-Wan
has
You
have
Now...
release
your
anger.
Only
your
hatred
Ohh!
The
security
code
R2,
you
can
tell
to
override
R2,
hurry!
Attention.
This
is
Attention.
The
Empire
has
taken
I
advise
everyone
to
leave
I
advise
everyone
to
leave
This
way.
Well,
don't
blame
me.
I'm
not
supposed
to
know
a
power
socket

Ah!
We're
not
interested...
in
the
Millennium
It's
fixed!
Just
open
the
door,
I
never
doubted
you
Wonderful!
Ouch!
Oh!
That
hurts!
Bend
down,
Leia!
Go!
I
thought
that
hairy
beast

Of
course
You
are
beaten.
It
is
useless
to
resist.
Don't
let
yourself
as
Obi-Wan
did.
Uh!
Aah!
There
is
no
escape.
Don't
make
