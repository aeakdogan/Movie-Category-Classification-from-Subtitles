Tell
me,

...as
a

man,
Let
me
show
you
HOLMES:
Observe.
How
did
you
see
that?
Because
I
was
looking
for
it.

WATSON:
You
seem
surprised.
I'd
say
the

Indeed.
Oh,
I'd

Tell
me
something.
Your

are
you
moving

I
should
be

Well,
that's

Good

No,
no.

it?
My

I'll...
I'll
go

Your

Won't

will
he?
No,
he
won't.
Mrs.
Hudson.
I
won't
go
in,
You
don't
have
to.
Give
me
the
paper.
What'll
I
do
when
you
leave,
doctor?
He
just
needs
another

That's
all.
Couldn't
you
have
a
longer
engagement?
I
smell

It's
not

Watson,
I
am
in

WATSON:
Can
I
see
that?

You
know,
it's
been
three
months...
...since
your
last

HOLMES:
Yes,
yes.
Gently,
gently,
Watson.

Don't

can't

There's

Yes,

Oh.

Yes.
It
was
our
last

together

is
seeking...
There's
only
one

The
curious

of
Mrs.
Hudson,
I've
been
studying
They
appear
most
sinister.
Tea,
Mr.
Holmes?
Is
it
poisoned,
nanny?
There's
enough
of
that
in
you
already.
Don't
touch.
...as
per
usual,
nanny.
He's
killed
the
dog.
Again.
WATSON:
I
was
simply
testing
a
new
anesthetic.
He
doesn't
mind.
Holmes,
as
your
doctor...
-
He'll
be
as
right
as
a
trivet
in
no
time.
...you've
been
in
this
room
for
two
weeks.
There's
nothing
of
interest
for
me

You're
free
this
evening?
-
Dinner?
The

Mary's
coming.
-
Not
available.
Have
you
proposed
yet?
-
No,
I
haven't
found
the

It's

whether
you
like
it
or
not.
8:30,

A

Straighten
your

WATSON:
Holmes.
You're

Fashionably.
Miss

My
goodness.
What
a
pleasure.
I
don't
know
why
it's
taken
him
so
long
Pleasure
is
mine.
It
really
is
quite
a
thrill
to
meet
you,
I've
heard
so
much
about
you.
I
have
a
pile
of
detective
novels
at
home.

Wilkie
Collins,
Poe.
It
can
seem
a
little
far-fetched
...making
grand
assumptions
That's
not
quite
right,
is
it?
In
fact,
the
little
details
-
Take
Watson.
See
his
walking
stick?
...hiding
a
blade
of
high-tensile
steel.
A
few
were
awarded
...so
I
can
assume
Strong,
brave,
And
neat,
like
all
military
men.
Now,
I
check
his
pockets.
Ah.
A
stub
from
a
boxing
match.
I'd
keep
an
eye
on
that
dowry.

Those
days
are
behind
me.
He's
cost
us
the
rent
more
than
once.
Well,
with
all
due
respect,
Mr.
Holmes,
What
about
a
complete
stranger?
-
What
can
you
tell
about
me?
-
I
don't
think...
-
Not
at
dinner.
-
I
insist.
-
You
remember
we
discussed
this.
-
You're
a
governess.
Yes,
well
done.
Shall
we?
-
Waiter?
...is

-
Charlie's

actually.
Then
he's
tall
for
his
age.
Is
there
ink
on
my
face?
There's
nothing
wrong
with
your

There
are

your
ear,
in
fact.

spent
some
time
abroad

you
were
informed
You
broke
off
the
engagement...
...and
returned
to
England
A
doctor,
perhaps.
Right
on
all
counts,
Mr.
Holmes,
I
didn't
leave
him.
He
died.
Well
done,
old
boy.

-
Fight.
Fight.
McMURDO:
Fight.

Finish
it.
Get
up

Come

Get

Lord

him
It's
like
he's
burning
from
the
inside
out.
You
lot,
shut
up!
Charlie.
Charlie!
Take
this
man
to
the
infirmary,
now.
What's
this
all
about,
then,
Blackwood?
There's
someone
I
want
to
see.

-
Watson?
Let's
go.
What
started
merely
as
an
experiment...
...has
brought
me
to
the
threshold
Now,
if
I
play
a
chromatic
scale...
...there's
no
measurable
response.
You
do
know
what
you're
drinking
But,
now...
...and
this
is
remarkable...
...if
I
change
to
atonal
clusters...
...voilà,
they
fly
in
counterclockwise,
...as
though
a
regimented
flock.
Watson,
this
is
exceptional.
I,
using
musical
theory,
How
did
you
lure
them
in?
Excellent
question.
Individually.
I've
been
at
it
for
six
hours.
-
And
what
happens
if
I
do
this?
-
Right.
You
are
Blackwood's
last
request.
Look
at
those
towering
structures.
It's
the
first
combination
of
bascule
Most
innovative.
What
an
industrious
empire.
Hm?
Oh,
I
have
your
winnings
from
last
night.
You
weren't
there,
Right.
I'll
keep
it
with
your
checkbook,
Did
you
know
the
opera
house
I
could
procure
a
couple
of
tickets
if
you

You
have
the
grand
gift
of
silence,
It
makes
you
quite
invaluable

I
knew
she'd
been
engaged.
She
had
told
me.
So
that's
no
to
the
opera,
then?
-
That
was
my
waistcoat.
-
I'd
like
it
back.
I
want
it
back.

This
way,
Mr.
Holmes.
Blackwood
certainly
seems
to
have
got
Which
I'm
certain
will
disperse
Care
to
come
along?
No,
old
cock.
Suit
yourself,

It

you
have
lots
of

Thank
you,

the
dragon
gave
him
his
power
I
love
what
you've
done
with

So
glad
you
could
accept
my
invitation.
I
just
have
a
small
point
of
concern.
-
How
can
I
help?
While
my
heart
went
out

couldn't
but
notice
a
criminal
mastery

You're
too
kind.

work
in
the
crypt
So
now
you're
curious
Either
that
or,
um...
...shortly
my
friend
will
pronounce
you
dead
Your
mistake
is
to
imagine
that
Your
error
ofjudgment
is
to
assume
-
I'm
merely
the
channel.
You
see,
Mm.
Those
lives
were
a
necessity.
Hm.
Sacrifice.
Five
meaningless
creatures
I
wonder
if
they'd
let
Watson
and
me
After
you're
hanged,
of
course.
I'd
wager
there's
some
deformity
Then
you,
too,
Mr.
Holmes,
you
must
widen
your
gaze.
I'm
concerned
you
underestimate
You
and
I
are
bound
together
...that
will
twist
the
very
fabric
of
nature.
But
beneath
your
mask
of
logic,
That
worries
me.
Steel
your
mind,
Holmes.
I
need
you.
You've
come
a
long
way
down
-
And
I
will
rise
again.
Pay
attention.
Three
more

there

time
you
realize
you

Not
sure.
But
I
don't
think
you're
needed,
Father.
MAN:
...you
are
sentenced
to
death

unholy
murder
of

the

any

Death...

afoot.
HOLMES
&
WATSON:
"God
for
Harry,
England
and
St.
George."
There
you
are.
Why
that
certain
chips
stall,
There's
a
particular
beer
in
their
batter.
WATSON:
You
know,
Holmes,
I
once
met
a
man
...right
down
to
the
number
...of
the
bullets
that
killed
him.
You
have
to
admit,
Holmes...
...that
a
supernatural
explanation
...is
theoretically
possible.
Well,
agreed,
but
it's
a
huge
mistake
Inevitably
one
begins
to
twist
facts
...instead
of
theories
to
suit
facts.
That
said,
I
believe
Adler's
midget
WATSON:
HOLMES:
Right.
Scratches
around
-
What
does
that
tell
you?
Every
time
he
wound
the
watch
Very
good,
Watson.
You've
developed
considerable
Let's
see
now,
there
are
several

Pawnbrokers'
marks.
Most
recent
of
which
are
"M.H."
-
Maddison
and
Haig.
They
should
be
able
to
What
a
coincidence.
There's
one
thing
you've
HOLMES:
WATSON:
Taking
tea
with
the
in-laws.
-
Reckon
your
future,
sir?
WATSON:
No,
thank
you.
We
have
no
need
of
your
lucky
heather,
Even
if
it's
to
do
with
Mary?
Oh.
Oh.
I
see
two
men.
Brothers.
Not
in
blood,
but
in
bond.
What
of
Mary?
M
for
Mary,
for
marriage.
Go
on.
I
see
patterned
tablecloths...
...and,
oh,
china
figurines...
...and,
oh,
lace
doilies.
Doilies.
Lace
doilies?
Holmes.
Does
your
depravity
know
no
bounds?
-
No.
...and,
oh,
she
has
a
beard
and...
-
What
of
the
warts?
-
Enough.
Please,
enough.
It's
the
most
apt
prediction
And
precisely
the
reason
Do
you
have
my
money?
You
are
terrified
of
a
life
-
Do
you
have
my
cut
from
the
fight?
-
Give
me
my
money!
Holmes.
HOLMES:
Thank
you.
HOLMES:
Well,
you've
got
your
ring
and
-
Should
be
just
there.
And
I
have
some
change
in
my
pocket.
-
Shall
I
look
after
it
for
you?
-
Don't
give
it
away
here.
I
have
to
go
see
Mary.
Give
her
my
best.
And
her
family,
as
well.
It
does
make
a
considerable
...having
someone
with
me
Well,
you
can
rely
on
me
He
clearly
felt
something
HOLMES:
Irene
Adler
was
here.
Either
that
or
the
ginger
midget

Ah.
Putrefaction.

Ammonium
sulfate,
among
other
aromas.

Phosphorous.
Formaldehyde.
It
looks
like...
...he
was
attempting
to
combine...
...some
kind
of
sorcery
HOLMES:
...let's
see
what
he
was
-
Potassium,
magnesium.
It'll
suck
the
iron
right
out
of
the
ink
Peculiar.
Hydrated
rhododendron.

-
Holmes.
Look
at
the
crest.
Reordan
was
working
with
Blackwood.
Of
course
he
was.
The
question
is,
to
what
end.
Whatever
he
was
working
on,
How
so?
Otherwise,
he'd
still
be
alive.
Which
is
why
Miss
Adler
HOLMES:
There
is
one
odor
-
Mm?
Maple
syrup?
Barley
sugar.
Toffee
apple.
Let
me
guess.
Judging
by
your
arsonist
tool
kit...
...you're
here
to
burn
down
the
building
Just
one
minute,
boys.
Oh,
Dredger.


Meat...
...or
potatoes?
My
10
minutes
are
up.


WATSON:


Holmes...
...what
is
that?
DREDGER:



HOLMES:
WATSON:

...what
have
you
done?
WATSON:
Not
a
wink.
Why
I
ever
believed...
...that
I
would
get
to
have
tea
...having
been
talked
into
going
with
you.
I've
been
reviewing
my
notes
Would
you
like
to
know
my
conclusion?
-
I
am
psychologically
disturbed.
Why
else
would
I
continually
be
...where
you
deliberately
withhold
You've
never
complained
-
I'm
not
complaining.
How
am
I
complaining?
I
never
complain.
Do
I
complain
about
you
practicing
...or
your
mess,
your
lack
of
hygiene,
We
have
a
barter
system.
Do
I
complain
-
Our
rooms.
When
do
I
complain
-
Our
dog.
Gladstone
is
our
dog.
Where
I
do
take
issue
is
your
campaign
I
understand.
-
Do
you?
-
I
don't
think
you
do.
-
Yes.
I'm
not
sensitive.
What
you
need
is
a
rest.
My
brother,
Mycroft,
Beautiful
grounds.
There's
a
folly.
We?
Holmes,
if
I
were
to
go
to
the
country,
-
Well,
certainly,
if
we
must...
-
You
are
not...
Why
would
I
not
be
invited
Now
you're
not
making
any
sense.
You're
not
human.
MAN:
Yes.
Your
bail's
been
posted.
WATSON:
Just
Watson.
I
hope
you
get
bail
by
breakfast,

LESTRADE:
Back
off.
Back
off.
To
which
the
barman
says,

Right,
you,
you're
out.
Until
next
time,
Big
Joe.
Always
a
pleasure,
Mr.
Holmes.
Thank
heaven
you're
here.
In
another
life,
And
you,
sir,
an
excellent
policeman.
Now,
please
tell
me
you
have
answers.
All
in
good
time,
Lestrade.
"All
in
good
time"?
Is
this
some
parlor
game
I've
got
a
public
in
frenzy
out
there.
...I'll
have
you
in
there
playing
Victoria
Now,
clean
up
For
whom?
Friends
in
high
places.

I'm
terribly
sorry
...but
I'm
gonna
have
to
put
this
on
you.
Mr.
Holmes,
I'm
sure
it's
quite
a
mystery
As
to
where
I
am...
...I
was,
admittedly,!
Ost
for
a
moment
But
I
was
saved
by
the
bread
shop
...the
only
baker
to
use
a
certain

Brittany
sage.
The

And
as
to

you
are,
that

Chief
Justice,

Judging
by

on
your
ring...
...you're
the
head
of

we
now
sit...
...on
the
northwest
corner
As
to
the
mystery,
the
only
mystery

Yes,
well,
standard
procedure,

I
daresay
we
have
the
right
man,
Sherlock
Holmes,
...and
Lord
Coward,
the
home
secretary.
I
suppose
you
already
have
some
notion
HOLMES:
They're
practically
interesting.
Be
as
skeptical
as
you
like.
But
our
secret
systems
have
steered
The
danger
is
they
can
also
be
used
What
some
call
the
dark
arts,
STANDISH:
We
know
We
don't
expect
you
to
share
our
faith...
...merely
our
fears.
Fear
is
the
more
infectious
condition.
In
this
instance...
...fear
of
your
own
child.
Blackwood
is
your
son.
You
have
the
same
irises,
...with
diamond-shaped
hazel
flecks...
...together
with
identical
outer
ears,
which
...which
makes
you
either
brothers...
...or,
in
this
case,
more
likely,
Very
few
people

we
want
to
keep
it
that
way.
He
was
conceived
His
mother
wasn't
my
wife...
...but
she
shared
our
beliefs.
She
was
a
powerful
practitioner...
...though
not
enough
Death
followed
him
wherever
he
went.
Those
five
girls
were
not
the
first
He
killed
many
more,
No
one
could
prove
anything,
The
boy
was
a
curse.
We've
done
our
best
to
stop
him,
His
power
grows
daily.
His
resurrection
is
evidence
of
that.
But
what
he
does
next
ROTHERAM:
His
secret
lies
in
the
book
He's
gonna
raise
a
force
We
want
you
to
find
him
COWARD:
We'll
give
you
any
assistance
As
home
secretary,
I
have
considerable
HOLMES:
COWARD:
The
benefit
of
being
...is
that
I
can
pick
and
choose
So
consider
it
done,
I'll
stop
him.
But
not
for
you.
And
certainly
not
for
a
price.
-
I
do
have
a
parting
query,
Sir
Thomas.
If
the
rest
of
his
family's
dead,
Food
for
thought.
Well,
perhaps
you'll
have
better
luck
Margaux
'58.
A
comet
vintage.
How
fascinating
that
an
astronomical
event
How
is
it
going
with
our
case
-
Of
the
wine.
Oh,
I've
hit
a
dead
end,
literally.
I
found
your
man.
He's
buried
in
Blackwood's
tomb.
If
you
still
need
him.
Oh,
dear.
Hope
my
client
He's
a
professor,
isn't
he?
Couldn't
see
his
face,
I've
never
known
a
professor
to
carry
a
gun,
Eye
patch,
nice
touch.
So
case
closed...
...which
makes
this
a
social
visit.
No,
it's
a
"you're
in
over
your
head,
Whoever
killed
Reordan
...which
makes
you
the
next
loose
end

Let
it
breathe.
I've
never
been
in
over
my
head.
Leave
now.
Disappear.
Or
stay
and
volunteer
If
I'm
in
danger,
so
are
you.
Come
with
me.
What
if
we
trusted
each
other?
Hm?
You're
not
listening.
I'm
taking
you
to
either
the
railway
station

So...
-
Which
is
it
to
be?
You
decide.
-
Which
will
it
be?
I
told
you
to
let
it
breathe.
Can
you
taste
the
comet?
Why
couldn't
you
just
Never.




Madam,
I
need
you
to
remain
calm
But
beneath
this
pillow
-
She
misinterpreted
my
intention
entire!
Y.
That's
why
I
find
this
modern
-
No
latitude
for
misunderstanding.
Indeed.
And
chambermaids
My
wife's
a
chambermaid,
sir.
Anyhow,
a
good
thing
she
was
offended,
The
inspector's
been
over
to
Baker
Street
-
Just
joking
about
the
wife,
sir.
CLARK:
No
sign
of
a
break-in
So
body
in
the
bathtub...
...his
eyes
were
wide
open,
...his
ring,
sir.
Why
did
you
drain
the
water?
-
Out
of
common
decency.
The
decent
thing
to
do
is
to
catch
the
killer,
What
is
that?

-
Jasmine
bath
salts,
sir.
Probably
comes
from
a
larger
container.
...high
up
where
it's
warm
and
dry,
Constable,
you
could
do
worse...
...than
to
check
the
ground
under
Data,
data,
data.

CLARK:

Was
it
in
the
cupboard
or
the
pantry?
It
was
in
the
pantry,
sir.
I
don't
know
what
to
make
of
this.
Excellent
work.
Adieu.

What's
the
meaning
of
this,
Coward?
Sir
Thomas
is
dead.
I
nominate
Lord
Blackwood

Have
you
lost
your
mind?
You
know
damn
well
BLACKWOOD:
That's
why
we're
here.
That's
why
we're
all
here.
My
powers
and
my
assets
A
magnificent
but
simple
purpose.
To
create
a
new
future.
A
future
ruled...
...by
us.
Tomorrow
at
noon,
we
take
the
first
step
Magic
will
lead
the
way.
Once
the
people
of
England
...they'll
bow
down
in
fear.
Across
the
Atlantic
It
will
be
again.
The
Civil
War
has
made
them
weak.
Their
government
is
as
corrupt
...so
we'll
take
it
back.
We
will
remake
the
world...
...create
the
future.
These
men
are
with
me,
Standish...
...but...
...are
you?
No,
sir.
I
am
not.
These
powers
that
you're
playing
with...
...no
man
can
control.
Well,
gentlemen...
...someone
has
to
stop
him,
Oh,
I
wouldn't
do
that
if
I
were
you.

STANDISH:
Gentlemen...
...don't
be
afraid.
As
you
can
see...
...we
are
protected.
Come,
drink
your
allegiance
here.
You
control
the
police,
now
use
them.
Didn't
know
you
were
here.
Since
this
room
is
no
longer
yours,
Be
my
guest.
-
In
here,
chaps.
...to
put
him,
sir?
WATSON:
Who
is
he?
His
neck
didn't
survive
the
impact
Yes.
Thanks
for
that,
by
the
way.
There
is
consolation
in
the
knowledge
that
Elbows
and
arms
stained
with
blood,
None
of
it
human.
He's
not
a
butcher,
let
me
see.
Yellow
flame,
green
bursts.
An
industrial
worker.

Pff.
Coal.
River
silt.
The
slag
on
his
trousers
-
Nine
Elms.
The
area
you're
looking
for
is
Nine
Elms.
I
wondered.
Do
you
remember
where
I
put
It's
on
the
stepladder.
Well,
Blackwood's
had
his
hand
in
just
about
Woolwich
Arsenal.
It'll
probably
be
a
factory
by
the
river.
What's
that?
Never
mind.
You
don't
know
where
No,
not
a
clue.
Queenshithe
Slaughterhouse.
Nine
Elms.
A
factory
by
the
river.
Well
done.
That
should
lead
us
Not
us.
You.
Yes.
Just
a
figure
of
speech,
old
boy.
He's
left
it
there
on
purpose.



More
coal,
doctor.
That's
a
good
one.
He's
such
a
tit.
Oh,
God.
Yeah.
WATSON:
Glad
to
see
you
two
And
I
thought
we
were
You
would
not
last
one
day
in
the
navy.
Are
you
sure
there
isn't
an
alternative
I
guarantee
you
nobody
knows
-
Tanner's
practically
a
fish
himself.
Oh,
you
found
a
sense
of
humor,
doctor.
If
only
just
a
sense.
I
better
take
over,
there.
Come
on,
come
on.
WATSON:
Look
familiar?
All
that's
missing
is
a
ginger
midget.
They
cleared
something
away
from
here
Like
what?
Not
sure.
Something
mechanical.
Holmes.
Look
at
this.
-
1:18.
Revelations
1:18.
BLACKWOOD:
I
warned
you,
Holmes,
to
accept
...beyond
what
your
rational
mind
-
What
a
busy
afterlife
you're
having.
Tomorrow,
at
midday,
Show
me
your
face,
Save
your
bullets,
Watson.
A
gift
for
you.

What
was
that
about
saving
bullets?

BLACKWOOD:
You
led
your
lamb
to
slaughter.
Holmes.
This
game
was
designed
to
hurt.
Watson!
It's
warm
in
here,
Watson.
In
over
your
head
yet,
darling?
WATSON:
Hold
on
there.
Let
me
take
your
weight.
HOLMES:

These
German
locks

It's
a
band
saw.
No
matter,
we
have
plenty
of
time.
Holmes.
-
It's
not
working.
Holmes,
hurry
up.
Don't
get
excited.
Turn
off
that
valve.
And
we'll
bounce
in
three,
two...
...one.
Thank
you.
I'm
gonna
get
after
Blackwood.
Thank
you.
We
should
help
the
doctor.
Holmes!
CLARK
:
Sir.
Mr.
Holmes.
Mr.
Holmes,
we
have
an
order

Lord
Coward
has
issued
a
warrant
Now,
Watson's
alive.
Just
get
out
of
here,
sir.
Go,
sir,
go.

Will
the
train
be
departing
on
time?
The
train's
been
delayed,
madam.
Shouldn't
be
long
now,
though.
MAN:
And
you
will
leave
my
employment
I
fulfilled
my
contract.
I
found
Reordan.
He's
in
Scotland
Yard's
mortuary.
So
that's
me,
finished.
MAN:
Your
job
was
to
manipulate
Holmes'
...not
succumb
to
them.
You
have
fulfilled
nothing.
I
want
what
Reordan
was
making
Finish
the
job
or
the
next
dead
body...
...will
be
Sherlock
Holmes.
DOCTOR:
He
should
be
able
to
rest
now.
Excuse
me.
Is
that
the
best
you
can
do?
Yes,
for
now.
I
must
attend
to
my
other
patients.
MARY:
Doctor.
Please.
I
know
that
you
care
for
him
This
is
not
your
responsibility,
He'd
say
that
it
was
worth
the
wounds.

Solve
this.
Whatever
it
takes.

BLACKWOOD:
CLARK:
-
It's
Lord
Blackwood,
sir.
WATSON:!
T's
nothing
to
do
with
me,
MARY:
Solve
this.
BLACKWOOD:
-
Tomorrow,
at
midday,
the
world
will
end.
WATSON:
BLACKWOOD:
You
must
widen
your
gaze.
You
and
I
are
bound
together
on
a
journey
Steel
your
mind,
Ho!
Mes.
ROTHERAM:
He's
gonna
raise
a
force
COWARD:
His
power
grows
daily.
BLACKWOOD:
ROTHERAM:
BLACKWOOD:
...and
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
STANDISH:
WATSON:
ADLER:
WATSON:
He
clearly
felt
something
His
eyes
were
wide
open
BLACKWOOD:
This
is
a
riddle
you
cannot
solve.
ADLER:
Now,
you
need
to
work.
Familiar
artwork.
You
look
gorgeous.
HOLMES:
You
made
the
front
page.
Only
a
name
and
no
picture.
So
it
looks
like
you'll
be
needing
to
...and
that's
my
area
of
expertise.
I
feel
safer
already.
You
seem
to
be
making
a
rapid
recovery.
Yes.
Took
the
shrapnel
out
myself.
Mary
said
I
had
a
lousy
doctor.
Well,
I'm...
I'm
just
so...
...very
glad
that
you're...
...well...
...with
us.

Now
that
you're
sitting
comfortably,
My
initial
approach
was
far
too
narrow.
When
Blackwood
invited
me
...he
suggested
I
widen
my
gaze
In
fact,
I
may
well
have
reconciled

LESTRADE:
Get
out

way,
you
lowlifes!
Ladies
first.
LESTRADE:
HOLMES:
-
Aren't
you...?
Hello,
hello,
hello.
Did
the
devil
turn
up?
Well...
...never
mind.
You
got
the
next
best
thing.
Beg
your
pardon,
my
Lord.
...but
Mr.
Holmes
here...
...he's
been
making
some
...and
the
order.
I
see.
Well,
at
least
that
solves
the
great
mystery


Excuse
me,
my
Lord...
...but
I've
been
wanting
to
do
that
Well,
inspector,
I
have
five
minutes
...so
why
don't
you
regale
me
Thank
you,
Lestrade.
My
Lord.
I'm
curious,
Coward.
Did
you
assist
...orjust
the
one
I
prevented?
Very
distinctive,
But
the
price
of
quality
Nonetheless,
I
confess
to
being
I
could
deduce
very
little
Fortunately,
...than
a
case
where
everything
How
many
members
of
Parliament
Man,
ox,
eagle,
lion.
The
lion
is
Parliament,
isn't
it?
Very
clever.
But
it's
not
murder,
Mr.
Holmes.
It's
mercy.
We
are
giving
the
weak
masses
Don't
you
see
that
it's
for
their
own?
HOLMES:
I
simply
wanted
to
know
the
location
...and
you've
given
it
to
me.
I've
told
you
nothing.
HOLMES:
But
your
clothes
say
The
mud
on
your
boots
A
touch
of
red
brick
dust
on
your
knee
A
small
bandage
on
your
thumb
A
faint
aroma
of

Blackwood
laid
the
final
touches

the
sewers
beneath

Both
houses
meet
today.
The
whole
government
will
be
present.
COWARD:
It's
a
shame
you
made
an
enemy
You
would
have
made
a
valuable
ally.
How
terrible
is
wisdom...
...when
it
brings
no
profit
to
the
wise.
We
take
power
at
noon.
There
isn't
any
time
to
waste
then,
TANNER:
I
told
you
he'd
be
coming
There
isn't
any
way
Technically,
that
isn't
the

-
What
is
it?
Anyway.
You'll
be
pleased
to
know
In
fact,
I
think
he
enjoyed
it.
I
hope
you
know
what
you're
doing.
Here's
the
key.
-
You
got
all
you
needed
from
Coward?
-
Tanner?
If
you
would,
captain...
...take
us
under
the
bridge,
Beyond
that
you'll
find
the
tunnel
Right
away,
sir.


The
end
is
nigh.
Blackwood's

back

He
walks
in
every
shadow
Behold,
he
cometh
with
clouds...

every
eye

see
him...
...and
every
soul
shall
wail
You
cannot
stop
him!

ADLER
:
What
does
it
do?
The
first
of
its
kind.
You
deduced
that
how?
From
my
pocket.
I
snipped
this
off
a
rather
recumbent
rat

HOLMES

him.
Now,

My
lords.
The

has

only
those
who
believe
to

Behold...

Blackwood.

You
seem
surprised.
I
have

CHATTERING
Listen

Listen...

I

then
the

I've
never

anything

Specifically

HOLMES:

The

will
travel
up
that
shaft

leads
directly
to
Parliament.
...the
most
powerful

Blackwood
must
have
some

Three
minutes,
10

I
will
create
an
empire
...indestructible...
...and
eternal.
Move
it.
Move
it.
We
don't
actually
have
to

just
have
to
remove
the
cylinders.
Yes,
except
that
they're
welded
in.
What
we
need
is
a
controlled
explosion.
We'll
need
a
container
to
direct
the
blast.



I
rather
wish
you
hadn't
done
that,

On
the
12th
chime,
All
those

All

What

you
waiting
for?


That.
MAN:

Can
you

Relax...
...l'm

Did
you
take
a
wrong
turning
We're
safe
now.
Interesting
assessment.
Run
off.
I
won't
be

you
anymore.
Fare
thee
well.
I
don't
want

I'll
tell
you
everything.
No!
There
was
never
any

Only
conjuring
tricks.
The

the

the

slab
You
had
it
broken
before
your
burial,
An
ancient
Egyptian

I
believe...
...a
mixture
of
egg
and
honey...
...designed
to
be
washed
away
Holmes!
Arranging
for
your
father
...required
more
modern
science.
Very
clever
of
Reordan
...that
was
activated
by
the
combination
...and
was
therefore
undetectable
That
might've
been
a
challenge
for
me...
...had
he
not
also
tested
it
The
death
of
Standish
...until
you
used
the
same
compound
An
odorless,
tasteless

liquid...
...yet
it
burned
Did
Standish
mistake
it
for
rain
All
it
took
was
a
spark.
A
simple
rigged
bullet
in
his
gun.
Ingenious.
Like
all
great
performers,
you
saved
A
chemica!
Weapon

Ed
from
cyanide
Had
it
worked...
...your
followers
in
Parliament
...as
their
colleagues
They
didn't
know
Instead,
...and
that
you'd
harnessed
And
the
world
would've
followed,

You'd
better
hope
...as
you
performed
The
devil
is
due
a
soul,
I'd
say.
For
God's
sake,
Holmes,
cut
me
loose.

HOLMES:
First,
the
world
will
see
you
Then
you'll
be
hanged.
Properly,
this
time.
It's
a
long
journey
from
here
to
the
rope.


I've
never
woken
up
in
handcuffs
before.
I
have.
Naked.

ADLER:
HOLMES:
Moriarty.
What?
That's
his
name.
And
he
is
a
professor.
Everyone
has
a
weak
spot...
...and
he
found
mine.
Where
was
it,
precisely?
-
Please
don't
underestimate
him.
He's
just
as
brilliant
as
you
are...
...and
infinitely
more
devious.
We'll
see
about
that.
You'll
miss
me,
Sherlock.
Sadly...
...yes.
WATSON:
DRIVER:
Afternoon,
sir.
WATSON:
Thank
you.
Scribbles.
-
Scribbles?
MARY:
They're
your
adventures.

Come
on,
what's
wrong?
Do
you
think
he's
come
to
terms
Mary,
look
at
the
ring
he's
given
us.
Now,
five
minutes
here
Our
home.
Get
up
those
stairs.

Don't
worry,
dear.
Suicide
is
not
in
his
repertoire.
He's
far
too
fond
of
himself
for
that.
Holmes.
Oh.
Good
afternoon.
I
was
trying
to
deduce
the
manner
Clearing
your
good
name,
as
it
were.
But
it
had
a
surprisingly
...and
I
was
carried
off
in
the
arms
Good
afternoon,
dear.
WATSON:
Cleverly
concealed
in
the
hangman's
knot
Oh,
dear,
my
legs
have
fallen
asleep.
John,
shouldn't
we
help
him
down?
No,
no,
no,
Carry
on.
Well,
the
executioner
...allowing
the
weight
to
be
...and
the
neck
to
remain
intact.
My
Lord,
I
can't
feel
my
cheeks.
How
did
you
manage
it,
Holmes?
I
managed
it
with
braces,
Please,
my
tongue
is
going,
-
Worse
things
could
happen.
Yet
none
of
this
explains
HOLMES:
Now,
the
medical
mystery.
There
is
a
toxin
refined
from
the
nectar

t's
infamous

of
Turkey

its

to
mislead

known
as...
HOLMES:
Oh,
he's
demonstrating
He
doesn't
mind.
Mary,
don't
worry,
he's
seen
far
worse.
CLARK:

Miss
Mary.
Sir,
Inspector
Lestrade
asks
that
-
What
is
it
is
this
time,
Clarkie?
He
went
missing
!
'm
afraid
sewage
workers
We
believe
the
sergeant
Can
I
help
you,

Shot
in
the
head.
Was
it
a

bullet?
Yes.
Were
there

burns
Indeed,
sir.
Point
blank

Moriarty.
Professor
Moriarty.
MARY:
Everything's
gonna
be
fine.
Where
is
Blackwood's
device
now?
Secret
Service
have
it,
sir.
I'd
wager
there's
a
piece
missing.
So
Moriarty
was
after
...not
the
poison.
There's
nothing
more
elusive
The
wire-free
invention
And
Adler
was
just
the
diversion.
He
knew!
'd
chase
her,
A
technology
of
that
kind
Imagine
being
able
...simply
by
sending
a
command
It's
the
future,
Watson.

I've
loaded
the
last
of
your
boxes,
sir.
-
Well...

MARY:
Gladstone.
HOLMES:
Case
reopened.
