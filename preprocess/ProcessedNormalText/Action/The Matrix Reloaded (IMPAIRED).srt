See
you
tomorrow.

Oh,
my
God!
I'm
in.
We're
almost
there.
-
Sir,
are
you
sure
about
this?
I
understand,
sir.
It's
just
that
I'm
scoping
-
Link.
Given
your
situation,
I
can't
say
...for
volunteering
to
operate
However,
if
you
wish
to
continue
to
What's
that,
sir?
To
trust
me.
Yes,
sir.
I
will,
sir.
-
I
mean,
I
do,
sir.
Repatch
the
main
AC
to
the
hard
drives
Yes,
sir.

Still
can't
sleep?
You
wanna
talk?
They're
just
dreams.
If
you're
afraid
of
something...
I
just
wish...
I
wish
I
knew
what
I'm
supposed
to
do.
That's
all.
I
just
wish
I
knew.
She's
gonna
call.
Don't
worry.
Here
you
are.
-
Are
we
ready
to
go?
These
geotherms
confirm
The
machines
are
digging.
They're
boring
from
the
surface
-
Mother...
How
fast
are
they
moving?
Control
estimates
their
descent
MAN
1:
How
deep
are
they?
-
What
about
the
scans
from
the
Osiris?
-
They
may
be.
That'd
mean
there
are
-
That's
right.
MORPHEUS:
A
sentinel
for
every
man,
That
sounds
exactly
like
Morpheus,
glad
you
could
join
us.
Niobe.
My
apologies
to
all.
...it's
become
difficult
to
locate
-
Squiddies
got
our
best
spots.
And
if
Niobe's
right,
in
72
hours
What
are
we
gonna
do?
We're
gonna
do
what
We'll
evacuate
broadcast
level
And
does
the
commander
have
a
plan
A
strategy
is
still
being
formulated.
I'm
sure
it
is.
MAN:
What
do
you
think
MORPHEUS:
Proceed
as
ordered...
I
don't
know.
MORPHEUS:
however,
I
must
Some
of
you
believe
as
I
believe,
some
...know
we
are
nearing
The
prophecy
will
be
fulfilled
soon.
...the
Oracle
must
be
consulted.
If
we
return
and
recharge
now...
...we
can
be
back
in
36
hours,
well
Do
you
understand
what
you're
asking?
I
am
asking
that
one
ship
...in
case
the
Oracle
Bullshit.
You're
asking
one
of
us
That's
right,
I
am.
But
we
well
know
...is
because
of
our
affinity
What
happens
when
you
...and
the
commander
He
won't.
Goddamn
it,
Morpheus,
Shit,
I'll
do
it
just
to
see
You
got
36
hours.
SMITH:
-
Never
heard
of
him.
A
gift.
You
see,
he
set
me
free.
Fine,
whatever.
Now
piss
off.
Who
was
that?
MAN:
He
gave
you
this.
He
said
you
set
him
free.
Is
everything
all
right,
sir?
The
meeting
is
over.
-
Agents
are
coming.
Go.

Hiya,
fellas.
AGENT
1:
It's
him.
-
Do
we
proceed?
-
He
is
still...
Hm.
Upgrades.
-
That
went
as
expected.
It's
happening
exactly
as
before.
Well,
not
exactly.
-
What
happened?
Agents
just
came
out
of
nowhere.
Then
the
code
got
all
weird.
-
Is
Neo
okay?
Where
is
he
now?
He's
doing
his
Superman
thing.
Where
are
you?
This
is
the
Nebuchadnezzar,
Nebuchadnezzar,
this
is
Zion
Control.
LINK:
This
is
Control
requesting
immediate
We
have

You
are

that,
Control.
Door's
open,

made.
No

Zion
Control,
CONTROL:
The
Nebuchadnezzar
is
down.
Understood.
Captain
Mifune.
Captain
Morpheus.
Are
you
here
to
escort
me
-
I'm
just
here
to
keep
the
peace.

Requests
your
immediate
counsel,
sir.
-
Link.
I
want
the
ship
ready
to
go
Understood,
sir.
-
What
is
it
between
them?
-
Niobe.
She
used
to
be
with
Morpheus.
What
happened?
Morpheus
went
to
the
Oracle.
Yeah,
she
can
do
that.
BOY:
NEO:
Oh,
no.
Doesn't
he
have
anything
better
to
do?
You
know
what
they
say
I
didn't
save
his
life.
Hiya,
Neo.
-
Trinity,
Link.
-
It's
great
to
have
you
back.
-
Can
I
carry
that
for
you?
-
Trinity?
-
You
can
carry
these.
Hey,
you
know,
next
year
I've
been
thinking
about
it,
Let
me
guess.
I
want
to
join
the
Nebuchadnezzar.
Morpheus
hasn't
filled
the
other
I'm
sure
he
has
reasons...
...but
the
more
I
think
about
it,
You
know,
it's
fate.
You're
the
reason
I'm
here,
Neo.
I
told
you,
you
found
me.
I
know,
but
you
got
me
out.
You
saved
yourself.
-
Morpheus.
I
spoke
to
the
other
captains.
I
wanted
to
I
wasn't
aware
that
my
actions
You
were
given
an
order
-
I
did.
I
would
have
stayed,
So
you
admit
to
a
direct
contravention
We
need
a
presence
inside
the
Matrix
I
don't
want
to
hear
that
shit!
I
don't
care
about
oracles
I
care
about
one
thing:
Stopping
that
To
do
that
I
need
soldiers
With
all
due
respect,
commander,
How?
-
Neo.
Not
everyone
believes
what
you
believe.
My
beliefs
do
not
require
them
to.
There's
a
gathering
tonight.
Everyone's
No
one
remembers
the
last
time
-
Something
big
is
happening,
isn't
it?
We're
not
allowed
to
say
anything,
Goddamn,
it's
good
to
be
home.
I'm
recommending
that
you
That
is,
of
course,
If
it
were
up
to
me,
you
wouldn't
set
foot
Then
I
am
grateful
that

-
Councilor
Hamann.
-
Captain.
Council's
asked
me
to
speak
tonight
The
presence
of
the
fleet
and
the
The
people
must
be
told
Of
course,
councilor.
But
might
I
advise
a
level
of
discretion
-
We
do
not
wish
to
start
a
panic.
A
panic
is
not
what
anyone
wants.
What
about
you,
captain?
The
truth.
No
one
will
panic,
That
army
won't
reach
-
What
makes
you
so
sure?
Consider
that
in
the
past
six
months...
...we
have
freed
more
minds
This
attack
is
an
act
of
desperation.
I
believe
very
soon
the
prophecy
I
hope
you're
right,
captain.
I
do
not
believe
it
to
be
It
is
simply
a
matter
of
time.
My
stop.
See
you
soon.
Hopefully
not
too
soon.
Let's
go,
kid.
Are
you
thinking
what
I'm
thinking?
I
am
if
you're
thinking
-
How
long
do
we
charge
the
Neb?
Some
people
go
their
entire
lives
Neo,
please,
I
have
a
son,
-
Please,
watch
over
him.
WOMAN:
No,
wait.
It's
all
right.
They
need
you.
-
I
need
you.
There's
time.
Where's
my
puss..?
-
Hey!
God!
CHILDREN:
Oh,
my
God!
You're
so
huge!
-
You
should
be
picking
me
up!
-
Yeah!
LINK:
Now,
we're
gonna
have
One,
two,
three,
lift!
Oh,
my
God!
Come
on,
kids.
It's
time
to
go.
-
Hey,
Cas.
-
Good
to
have
you
home,
Link.
You
be
careful
with
her.
Don't
worry
about
me.
CAS:
LINK:
Bye!
I'm
gonna
get
what?
Every
ship
up
there's
been
home
two,
even
Come
on,
Zee.
-
We'll
be
when
you
operate
another
ship.
-
Why?
If
Dozer
knew
how
I
felt,
Maybe.
But
it's
too
late
now.
I
made
a
promise,
-
It's
not
fair.
You
think
Cas
thinks
it's
fair
I
lost
two
brothers
to
that
ship,
Link.
I'm
afraid
of
it.
I'm
afraid
it's
gonna
take
you
too.
It
won't.
How
can
you
say
that
to
me?
Because
of
Morpheus.
Because
of
what
he's
told
me.
He
said
-
Link,
Morpheus
is
crazy.
But
Tank
and
Dozer
believed
him.
...after
being
on
that
ship
and
seeing
Neo
...I'm
starting
to
believe
him
too.
Be
careful,
Link.
Please
be
careful.
-
They
started
yet?
Tonight,
let
us
honor
These
are
our
soldiers,
our
warriors.
These
are
our
husbands
and
wives,
...our
children.
Let
us
remember
those
...and
let
us
give
thanks
...and
who
stand
here
beside
us.
Now
I
would
like
someone
else
...someone
who
hasn't
spoken
here
...but
who
I
believe
has
something
to
say
I
give
you
Morpheus.
Zion!
Hear
me!
It
is
true
what
many
of
you
have
heard.
The
machines
have
gathered
...that
army
is
drawing
nearer
to
our
home.

Believe
me
when
I
say
we
have
But
if
we
are
to
be
prepared
for
it,
I
stand
here
before
you
now
Why?
Because
I
believe
something
you
do
not?
No!
I
stand
here
without
fear
I
remember
that
I
am
here
not
because
...but
because
of
the
path
I
remember
that
for
100
years
I
remember
that
for
100
years
And
after
a
century
of
war,
We
are
still
here!
Tonight...
...let
us
send
a
message
to
that
army.
Tonight,
let
us
shake
this
cave.
Tonight,
let
us
tremble
these
halls...
...of
earth,
steel
and
stone.
Let
us
be
heard
from
red
core
Tonight,
let
us
make
them
remember:
This
is
Zion
and
we
are
not
afraid!
NIOBE:
I
remember
you
used
to
dance.
I
remember
you
were
pretty
good.
There
are
some
things
in
this
world,
...that
will
never
change.
LOCK:
Some
things
do
change.
Excuse
me.
-
I
missed
you.
I
was
thinking,
everyone
is
here.
Follow
me.

Neo,
what
is
it?
What's
wrong?
It's
okay,
you
can
tell
me.
Trinity...
Don't
be
afraid.
I
can't
lose
you.
You're
not
gonna
lose
me.
You
feel
this?
I'm
never
letting
go.
Good
night,
Zion.
Sweet
dreams.

-
You
all
right?
Did
you
see
that
agent?
It
doesn't
matter.
You
first.
-
Oh,
God.
-
Thank
you.

-
Care
for
some
company?
I
don't
want
to
intrude
-
No,
I
could
probably
use
some
company.
So
could
I.
It's
nice
tonight.
Very
calm.
It
feels
like
everyone
is
sleeping
Not
everyone.
I
hate
sleeping.
I
figure
I
slept
the
first
11
years
-
What
about
you?
-
It's
a
good
sign.
That
you
are
in
fact
still
human.
Have
you
ever
been
I
love
to
walk
there
at
night.
-
Would
you
like
to
see
it?

Almost
no
one
comes
down
here.
That's
how
it
is
with
people.
Nobody
cares
I
like
it
down
here.
I
like
to
be
reminded
this
city
survives
These
machines
are
keeping
us
alive
Interesting,
isn't
it?
...and
the
power
to
end
it.
Yeah,
I
suppose
we
do,
but...
...sometimes
I
think
about
those
people
And
when
I
look
at
these
machines...
...I
can't
help
thinking
that,
in
a
way,
But
we
control
these
machines,
Of
course
not.
How
could
they?
The
idea
is
pure
nonsense...
...but
it
does
make
one
wonder
just...
...what
is
control?
If
we
wanted,
we
could
Of
course.
That's
it.
You
hit
it.
If
we
wanted,
Although
if
we
did,
we'd
have
to
consider
...our
heat,
our
air.
So
we
need
machines
and
they
need
us.
No.
No
point.
Old
men
like
me
don't
bother
Is
that
why
there
are
no
young
men
Good
point.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
There
is
so
much
in
this
world...
...that
I
do
not
understand.
See
that
machine?
It
has
something
to
do
I
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
it
works.
But
I
do
understand
the
reason
I
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
you
But
I
believe
there's
a
reason
for
that
I
only
hope
we
understand
that
reason
-
Ballard.
Neo,
it's
from
the
Oracle.
It's
time
to
go.
Morpheus
said
this
was
how
I
don't
know.
Maybe
the
prophecy's
true,
All
I
know
is,
that
ship
needs
an
operator.
Right
now,
that
operator's
me.
I
know.
-
Zee...
-
You
know
I
don't
believe
in
this
stuff.
It's
always
brought
me
luck.
-
Maybe
it'll
bring
me
you.
I
promise.
No
matter
what
it
takes,
Just
keep
it
with
you.
Please.
For
me.
Okay.

BOY:
Neo!
Bane.
Is
something
wrong?
No,
I'm
fine.
I
just
wanted
to
catch
you
to
say...
...good
luck.
Thanks.
We'll
see
you.
Neo!
Just
in
time.
-
You're
gonna
see
the
Oracle?
I
had
to
give
something
to
Neo.
A
gift
from
one
of
the
orphans.
He
made
me
swear
to
get
it
to
you
He
said
you'd
understand.
Thanks.
I
was
just
told
you
cleared
That
is
correct.
Am
I
still
in
charge
Of
course.
I
believe
I
need
every
ship
we
have
I
understand
that,
commander.
Then
why
did
you
allow
Because
I
believe
our
survival
depends
Be
careful.


Hello.
-
You
seek
the
Oracle.
I
am
Seraph.
I
can
take
you
to
her,
Apologize
for
what?
For
this.
Good.
The
Oracle
has
many
enemies.
-
Of
what?
-
You
could
have
just
asked.
...until
you
fight
them.
Come.
She's
waiting.
Where
the
hell
did
they
go?
These
are
back
doors,
aren't
they?
Programmer
access.
-
How
do
they
work?
One
position
opens
a
lock
and
another
Are
you
a
programmer?
Then
what
are
you?
I
protect
that
which
matters
most.
ORACLE:
Come
around
here
My
goodness,
look
at
you.
You
turned
out
all
right,
didn't
you?
-
How
do
you
feel?
I
know
you're
not
sleeping.
Why
don't
you
come
-
Maybe
I'll
stand.
-
I
felt
like
sitting.
So...
...let's
get
the
obvious
stuff
-
You're
not
human,
are
you?
If
I
had
to
guess,
I'd
say
you're
-
So
is
he.
But
if
that's
true,
that
could
mean
...another
kind
of
control.
-
Keep
going.
...how
can
I
trust
you?
It
is
a
pickle,
no
doubt
about
it.
...there's
no
way
you
can
really
know
So
it's
really
up
to
you.
Just
have
...to
either
accept
what
Candy?
-
Do
you
already
know
if
I'll
take
it?
But
if
you
already
know,
Because
you
didn't
come
here
to
make
You're
here
to
try
to
understand
I
thought
you'd
have
figured
that
out
-
Why
are
you
here?
I
love
candy.
But
why
help
us?
We're
all
here
to
do
I'm
interested
in
one
thing,
Neo:
And
believe
me,
I
know,
the
only
way
-
Are
there
other
programs
like
you?
Look.
See
those
birds?
At
some
point,
a
program
was
written
A
program
was
written
to
watch
over
the
There
are
programs
running
The
ones
doing
their
job,
doing
what
You'd
never
even
know
they
were
here.
Well,
you
hear
about
them
all
the
time.
-
I've
never
heard
of
them.
Every
time
you've
heard
someone
...every
story
you've
ever
heard
about
...is
the
system
assimilating
...that's
doing
something
Programs
hacking
programs.
-
Why?
...but
usually
a
program
chooses
exile
-
And
why
would
a
program
be
deleted?
Maybe
a
better
program
is
created
And
when
it
does,
a
program
...or
return
to
the
source.
-
The
machine
mainframe.
Where
you
must
go.
Where
the
path
of
the
One
ends.
...in
your
dreams,
haven't
you?
A
door
made
of
light?
What
happens
when
you
go
through
I
see
Trinity...
...and
something
happens...
...something
bad.
She
starts
to
fall,
-
Do
you
see
her
die?
You
have
the
sight
now,
Neo.
You
are
looking
at
the
world
Then
why
can't
I
see
We
can
never
see
past
the
choices
Are
you
saying
I
have
to
choose
No,
you've
already
made
the
choice.
Now
you
have
to
understand
it.
No.
I
can't
do
that.
I
won't.
-
Well,
you
have
to.
Because
you're
the
One.
What
if
I
can't?
What
happens
if
I
fail?
Then
Zion
will
fall.
Our
time
is
up.
Listen
to
me,
Neo.
...if
you
reach
the
source,
but
to
do
that
The
Keymaker?
He
disappeared.
We
didn't
He's
being
held
prisoner
...one
of
the
oldest
of
us.
-
And
he
won't
let
him
go
willingly.
What
do
all
men
with
power
want?
Be
there
at
that
exact
time...
...and
you
will
have
a
chance.
We
must
go.
Seems
like
every
time
we
meet
I'm
sorry
about
that.
I
surely
am.
But
for
what
it's
worth...
...you've
made
a
believer
out
of
me.
Good
luck,
kiddo.

Mr.
Anderson.
Did
you
get
my
package?
-
Yeah.
-
Smith?
-
Surprised
to
see
me?
-
Then
you're
aware
of
it.
Our
connection.
I
don't
fully
understand
how
it
happened.
Perhaps
some
part
of
you
...something
overwritten
or
copied.
It
is,
at
this
point,
irrelevant.
...that
whatever
happened,
And
what
reason
is
that?
I
killed
you,
Mr.
Anderson.
With
a
certain
satisfaction,
And
then
something
happened,
...but
it
happened
anyway.
You
destroyed
me,
Mr.
Anderson.
Afterward,
I
knew
the
rules,
I
understood
...but
I
didn't.
I
couldn't.
I
was
compelled
to
stay...
...compelled
to
disobey.
And
now,
here
I
stand
Because
of
you,
I'm
no
longer
an
agent
Because
of
you,
I've
changed.
A
new
man,
so
to
speak.
Congratulations.
Thank
you.
But
as
you
well
know,
...which
brings
me
back
to
the
reason
We're
not
here
because
we're
free.
There's
no
escaping
reason,
Because
as
we
both
know,
...we
would
not
exist.
-
Purpose
that
connects
us.
SMITH
5:
That
guides
us.
-
It
is
purpose
that
defines.
We
are
here
because
of
you,
We're
here
to
take
from
you
Purpose.
-
What's
happening
to
him?
Yes,
that's
it.
It'll
be
over
soon.
-
You.
Me,
me,
me.
Me
too.

More.
It
is
inevitable.
Come
on,
get
out
of
there.
Are
you
all
right?
-
It
was
Smith.
MORPHEUS:
Now
there's
more
than
one?
-
How
is
that
possible?
Somehow,
he's
found
a
way
-
Is
that
what
he
was
doing
to
you?
...but
I
know
what
it
felt
like.
It
felt
like
I
was
back
in
that
hallway.
It
felt
like
dying.
The
machines
are
tunneling
to
avoid
But
I
believe
they
will
intersect
These
points
of
intersection
...because
I
believe
they're
Although
it
has
been
suggested
that
...we've
defended
for
years,
This
is
the
single
greatest
threat
...and
if
we
do
not
act
accordingly,
Commander
Lock,
the
Council
is
well
You
have
our
leave
to
prepare
our
defense
-
Thank
you,
Council.
...we
ask
if
there's
been
word
No,
councilor.
No
word.
Nothing.
Then
we
request
a
ship
be
dispatched
I
wish
that
were
possible,
councilor,
...can
suffer
the
loss
of
another
ship.
It
could
take
one
ship
days
-
Then
send
two.
Careful,
commander.
Forgive
my
frustration,
councilors.
But
I
wish
I
were
able
to
comprehend
Comprehension
is
not
If
you
are
asking
me
There's
no
need
for
such
an
order.
The
captains
are
present.
The
Council
is
calling
for
two
volunteers
Are
there
two
among
you
Captain
Soren
of
the
Vigilant
You
understand
the
situation,
-
Yes,
ma'am.
Is
there
another?
-
Captain,
I
think
we
should
volunteer.
-
Listen...
...before
I
put
you
in
one.
Is
there
no
other?
Be
hard
for
any
man
to
risk
his
life...
...especially
if
he
doesn't
Captain
Niobe
of
the
Logos
-
What?
Commander
Lock,
you
have
your
orders.
-
Niobe,
what
are
you
doing?
Why?
Because
some
things
...and
some
things
do.
What
can
you
see,
Neo?
It's
strange.
-
Encrypted?
Is
that
good
for
us
or
bad
for
us?
Well,
it
looks
like
every
floor
Bad
for
us.
Here
we
go.

Yes.
We
are
here
to
speak
Well,
of
course.
Follow
me.
A-ha.
Here
he
is
at
last.
Neo,
the
One
himself.
Right?
And
the
legendary
Morpheus.
And
Trinity,
of
course.
You
honor
me.
Please,
sit.
Join
us.
Something
to
eat?
Drink?
Of
course,
such
things
are
contrivances,
For
the
sake
of
appearances.
-
No,
thank
you.
Who
has
time?
But
then,
if
we
do
not
ever
Chteau
Haut-Briond,
1959.
I
love
French
wine
I
have
sampled
every
language.
...especially
to
curse
with.

You
see?
It's
like
wiping
your
ass
You
know
why
we
are
here.
I
am
a
trafficker
of
information.
The
question
is,
We
are
looking
for
the
Keymaker.
Oh,
yes,
it
is
true.
But
this
is
not
a
reason,
The
Keymaker
himself,
his
very
nature,
And
so
to
look
for
him
is
to
be
...what?
But
do
you?
You
think
you
do,
but
you
do
not.
You
are
here
You
were
told
to
come
here,
It
is,
of
course,
the
way
of
all
things.
You
see,
there
is
only
one
constant...
...one
universal.
It
is
the
only
real
truth.
Causality.
Action,
reaction.
-
Cause
and
effect.
No.
Wrong.
Choice
is
an
illusion
created
...and
those
without.
Look
there
at
that
woman.
My
God,
just
look
at
her...
...affecting
everyone
around
her.
So
obvious,
so
bourgeois,
so
boring.
Watch.
You
see,
I
have
sent
her
...a
very
special
dessert.
I
wrote
it
myself.
It
starts
so
simply...
...each
line
of
the
program
creating
...poetry.
First...
...a
rush,
heat.
Her
heart
flutters.
You
can
see
it,
Neo,
yes?
She
does
not
understand
why.
Is
it
the
wine?
No.
What
is
it
then?
What
is
the
reason?
And
soon
it
does
not
matter.
Soon
the
why
and
the
reason
are
gone...
...and
all
that
matters
is
the
feeling
itself.
And
this
is
the
nature
of
the
universe.
We
struggle
against
it,
...but
it
is,
of
course,
pretense.
Beneath
our
poised
appearance...
...the
truth
is,
we
are
completely...
...out
of
control.
Causality.
There
is
no
escape
from
it.
Our
only
hope,
our
only
peace,
"Why"
is
what
separates
us
from
them...
...you
from
me.
"Why"
is
the
only
real
source
of
power.
And
this
is
how
you
come
to
me,
Another
link
in
the
chain.
But
fear
not.
Since
I
have
seen
how
good
you
are
...I
will
tell
you
what
to
do
next.
Run
back
and
give
the
fortuneteller
Her
time
is
almost
up.
Now
I
have
some
real
business
to
do,
-
This
isn't
over.
The
Keymaker
is
mine,
and
I
see
no
reason
-
No
reason
at
all.
Please,
ma
chrie,
I
have
told
you.
I
drank
too
much
wine,
Cause
and
effect.
Au
revoir.
Touch
me
and
that
hand
Well,
that
didn't
go
so
well.
Are
you
certain
the
Oracle
-
Yes.
Or
didn't
do
something.
No,
what
happened
couldn't
have
-
How
do
you
know?

If
you
want
the
Keymaker,
follow
me.
Get
out.
I
am
so
sick
and
tired
of
his
bullshit.
A
long
time
ago,
when
we
first
came
here,
He
was
so
different.
He
was
like
you.
I'll
give
you
what
you
want,
-
What?
Excuse
me?
I
want
you
to
kiss
me
-
Why?
It's
all
over
you
both.
A
long
time
ago,
I
want
to
remember
it.
Just
a
sample.
-
Why
don't
you
sample
this
instead?
Such
emotion
over
something
so
small.
Why
should
we
trust
you?
If
I
don't
deliver
you
to
the
Keymaker,
All
right.
But
you
have
to
make
me
believe
All
right.
Terrible.
Forget
it.
Wait.
Okay.
Yes.
That's
it.
I
envy
you.
But
such
a
thing
Come
with
me.
Not
again.
It's
all
right,
boys.
They're
with
me.
These
fellas
work
for
my
husband.
They
do
his
dirty
work.
Aren't
you,
boys?
MAN
