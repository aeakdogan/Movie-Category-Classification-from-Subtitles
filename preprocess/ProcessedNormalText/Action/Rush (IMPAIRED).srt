...what
has


With
the
the
drivers
prepare
for...


but
following
a
drivers'
meeting,
-a
decision
has
finally
been
taken.
Everybody
off
the
grid
now.



Twenty-five
drivers
and
each
year
two
of
us
die.
What
kind
of
person
Not
normal
men,
for
sure.
Rebels,
lunatics,
dreamers.
People
who
are
desperate
to
make
a
mark
and
are
prepared
to
die
trying.
My
name
is
Niki
Lauda,
and
racing
people
The
first
is
my
rivalry
with
him.


Photographers,
What
about
Hunt?
Has
he
changed?
No,
he's
going
on
wets.

I
don't
know
We
were
just
drivers
To
me
this
is
perfectly
normal,
but
other
people
saw
it
differently,
that
whatever
it
was
between
us


The
other
thing
I'm
remembered
for
is
what
happened
on
1st
August,
1976,
when
I
was
chasing
him
like
an
asshole.



Trauma
trolley,
please.
Hello,
I
think
the
racetrack
Hunt.
James
Hunt.
What's
the
matter?
No
one
ever
seen
-
Are
you
all
right?
We
all
thought
I
have.
If
you
call
a
friendly
disagreement
What
did
you
disagree
about?
It's
none
of
your
business.
"
His
wife.
That's
going
to
need
a
couple
It
was
a
nasty
blow.
-
Why?
What
did
you
do?
Only
what
she
asked
me
to
do.
Which
was...
I'd
be
happy
to
show
you,
if
you
like.
-

I
have
a
theory
It's
not
because
driving
round
and
round
in
circles.
Mostly
they
think
that's
pathetic,
It's
our
closeness
to
death.
You
see,
the
closer
you
are
to
death,
The
more
alive
you
are.
They
feel
that
in
you.
My
name
is
James
Hunt.
My
father
is
a
stockbroker,
my
sister
is
a
barrister
And
I...
Well,
I
do
this.
It's
a
wonderful
way
to
live.
It's
the
only
way
to
drive.
As
if
each
day
is
your
last.


I've
never
been
to
a
Grand
Prix
before.
Oh,
you
still
haven't.
-
This
is
Formula
3.
It's
a
lower
division,
where
idiots
like
me
mess
about
in
the
hope
of
being
talent-spotted
-
You
look
disappointed.
Ah.
You
only
slept
with
me
That's
not
true.
-
Don't
worry.
I
will
be
one
day.
Morning,
everyone.
-
This
is
Nursie.
Nursie,
this
is
Bubbles
Horsley,
How
do
you
do?
-
Bubbles?
-
Doc
Postlethwaite,
our
designer.
And
Alexander,
Lord
Hesketh,
How
do
you
do?
Fine,
thanks.

Well
done,
Superstar.
-
That's
the
car?
Lotus
59.
1,000cc
Cosworth
MAE
engine.
She's
no
beauty,


Nothing
to
be
worried
about.
Good
sign,
actually.
Means
he's
stoked.

All
Formula
3
cars


...drivers
please
bring
them
All
right,
Superstar?
Never
better,
patron.
-
Have
a
gargle
with
this.

Quick
toke
of
this.

At
Crystal
Palace
today,
with
Austrian
newcomer
and
Dave
Walker
completing
Row
1.
Row
2
is
Mike
Beuttler
and
Dave
Morgan,
-with
Tony
Trimmer
and
Gerry
Birrell.

He's
new.
-
Some
German.
He's
been
here
since
5:00
am,
You
might
actually
You'll
need
these.
-
Okay,
start
her
up.

Ah!
What
music!
They
could
never
have
imagined
it,
those
pioneers
that
it
would
possess
us
like
this,
Nursie,
men
love
women,
but
even
more
than
that,
men
love
cars.
-
Come
on,
James!
Go,
James!

Hunt's
still
in
the
lead,
but
Niki
Lauda
is
right
on
his
tail.


Hunt
and
Lauda
are
They're
leaving
the
pack
far
behind.
Herr
Red
Devil's
on
his
tail.


...and
he's
sold
him
a
dummy!
Lauda
is
through!
He's
in
the
lead!
Hunt
will
be
determined

Hunt's
in
Lauda's
slipstream.
Lauda's
not
leaving
any
gap.
The
Lotus
goes
for
the
inside.
Oh!
There's
contact!


The
leaders
have
spun
out!
-
The
back
marker's
gone
through.
-
-call
him
"Hunt
the
Shunt".

Asshole!
-
Go
on,
James!

There's
every
reason
It's
gonna
be
victory
for
Hunt.
It's
gonna
be
an
ignominious
defeat
-

So
James
Hunt
scores
his
here
at
Crystal
Palace,
after
a
desperate
battle
Lauda
was
unable
to
restart
after
Hunt's
aggressive
move
in
the
last
lap
of
the
race.

Hard
luck.
Hey,
asshole.
That
was
my
line.
I
had
that
corner.
Do
you
mean
the
one
that
you
spun
out
of
-
I
think
that
corner
had
you.
That
move
was
total
suicide.
-
We'd
have
crashed.
Thanks
to
your
impeccable

Fuck
you.
What's
your
name?
James
Simon
Wallis
Hunt.

And
it's
very
simple.
Hunt.
-
A
word
that
happens
Who
was
that?
I've
no
idea.


In
my
home
town,
Vienna,
my
family
is
famous
My
grandfather
was
a
businessman,
my
father,
too.
So
when
they
heard
I
wanted
they
had
a
few
things
to
say.

Gut.


So
if
my
family
I
decided
to
risk
everything
I
found
a
Formula
1
team
and
an
owner
who
had
run
out
of
money
and
was
willing
to
accept
my
terms.

And
so,
I'm
delighted
to
say
that
the
winner
of
the
Guild
of
Motoring
is
James
Hunt.

Superb
news!
-
Well
done,
James.
Fantastic!
-
Well
done.
Congratulations.
Yes!
Erm...
You
know,
my
parents
-
They
gave
me
the
first-class
education,
but,
well,
that
all
went
terribly
wrong
-and
I
ended
up
with
you
lot.
Thank
you.
I
need
it
more
than
you
do.

I
mean,
I
have
a
hot
head,
-
Yes!
I
fall
out
with
people
left
and
right.
The
only
creatures
I've
ever
really
-are
budgerigars.
So
in
any
normal
area
of
life
I'd
be...
The
only
thing
I've
got
going
for
me
So,
thank
you
for
this
I'm
going
to
give
it
to
my
father
and
tell
him
to
put
it
and
imagine
it's
a
first-class
degree



Well
done,
Superstar.
Another
season
like
that
Come
on,
you
don't
think
I'm
ready
now?
You
are.

I'm
not.
Well,
go
on,
then.
Chop-chop.
Don't
wait
too
long.
You
don't
want
him
-
Why?
What
did
he
do?
Well,
how
the
hell
did
he
do
that?
He's
never
won
a
bloody
thing.
Apparently,
took
out
a
loan
with
two
million
Austrian
schillings.
Jesus.


Niki
Lauda.
Sign
the

Mr
Stanley.
-
Good
morning.
Let
me
introduce
you
Clay
Regazzoni.
-
How
are
you?
-
Pleasure.
They're
reporting
exclusively
to
you,
Pleasure.
Do
you
wanna
see
the
car?
Sure.
Hello.

There
she
is.
P160.
-
Same
as
Regazzonfs?
How
much
does
she
weigh?
-600
kilos.
-
Why
so
heavy?
That
lump
weighs
190K
on
its
own.
Okay.
What
horsepower
are
you
getting?
490?
-
No,
no,
450.
It
needs
to
be
500,
and
the
engine

We
already
tried.

Tried
what?
We
replaced
the
entire
exhaust
system.
-
Barely
made
a
difference.

Now
the
engine
block.
Any
mounting
or
fixing
plates,
When
you've
done
that,
front
and
rear
wing.
Okay,
thank
you.
Good
night.

What
was
Regazzoni's
time?
1253.
Okay,
now
put
him
in
my
car,
-
Well,
that's
impossible.


Put
Regazzoni
in
the
car.

I
don't
understand.
I
don't
know,
Clay.

Gloves,
please.
'Fanculo.





-
I
would
say
we
push
it
a
bit...
What
did
you
do
to
the
car?
That's
information
I
will
share
with
you
Go
on.
A
guaranteed
place
in
the
team,
and
a
paid
contract
on
equal
terms

Are
you
crazy?
Clay's
a
senior
figure
in
Formula
1.
Well,
the
only
reason
we
took
you
on
Well,
as
of
now,
if
you
want
me
to
stay,
-
I
don't
pay
you
a
cent.
Was
he
quicker
in
my
car?
He
was,
wasn't
he?
Did
he
go
two
seconds
faster?
2.3.
So,
have
a
think,
work
out
your
priorities
Hey,
Niki.
I
know
what
you're
going
to
say,
What?
If
it's
the
track
manager
It's
none
of
your
business.
Okay,
but
if
you
want
my
advice,
I'm
not
questioning
your
taste.
Agnes's
last
boyfriend
who
has
a
reputation
for
two
things.
For
being
a
little
crazy
on
the
track,
and
for
going
all
night
and
all
day
He's
a
good
driver,
I
don't
know
about
you,
but

But
if
that
doesn't
bother
you...
What's
his
name,
the
driver?
Hunt.
James
Hunt.
You
see,
you
share
information
That's
what
teammates
are
for.


Where
the
hell
are
we
going?

I
promise
Just
keep
them
closed.
Wait
for
it.
-
Wait
for
it.
There.
What
do
you
say?

She's
Formula
1.
Yes,
she
is,
Superstar.
Your
brother
and
I
got
together
And
since
the
economics
of
F1
are
not
so
significantly
different
well,
we
thought
if
we
were
we
might
as
well
be
doing
it
on
You
fat,
little,
inbred
beauty.

Actually,
credit
where
it's
due,

Who?
Bought
his
way
in,
rather
than
I
thought,
"Bloody
hell,
he's
right."
No
sponsorship,
Superstar.
No
vulgar
logos
Just
plain
white
with
the
flags.
Ooh!
And
racing
overalls
which
read,
-"Sex.
Breakfast
of
champions."

So,
when
do
we
start?
-
Soon
as
you're
ready.
I've
been
waiting
for
this
-
Hi,
welcome
to
Watkins
Glen.

When
the
season
started,
whether
Lord
Hesketh
and
his
team
were
bringing
glamour
Certainly,
it
was
the
first
time
a
butler
serving
oysters
and
caviar
But
they
have
made
quite
an
impact.
Sixth
in
France,
fourth
in
Britain

All
drivers
on
the
track,
-
A
severe
crash
at
the
Esses.

Red
flag.

And
reports
are
reaching
me
that
there
has
been
Er,
the
identity
of
the
driver
we
don't
but,
as
you
can
tell
going
on
behind
me
towards
the
track,
it
is
clearly
a
grave
incident
indeed.
We
will,
of
course,
as
and
when
we
get
it,
but
it
is
the
sight
and
sound
-
Get
your
hands
off
me.

we've
lost
just
in
the
past
four
seasons

included
Piers
Courage,
Jo
Siffert,
Roger
Williamson
and
today,
at
Watkins
Glen,
Formula
1
has
claimed
another
driver.

The
Tyrrell
team
Their
places
on
the
grid
-
Terrible.
Why?
He
made
a
mistake,
It's
his
fault.
-
Is
that
right?
Look
at
the
tyre
marks.
So
says
the
nobody
How's
that
working
out
for
you,
Fine.
How
is
it
at
the
back?
Not
planning
on
being
there
for
long.

Ten
minutes.

Alexander
round?

Er,
yes,
he
was.
He
went
back
to
the
house
He'll
be
back
shortly.
He
only
wanted
to
show
me
Rhymes
with
"boy",
if
you
ask
me.
And
"toy".
God,
it's
so
flimsy
There's
no
comfort,
No,
it's
just
a
little
coffin,
really.
Surrounded
by
high-octane
fuel
in
here.
Being
driven
round
170
miles
per
hour.
To
all
intents
and
purposes,
You're
James,
aren't
you?
Yes.
You
fit
the
description.
Is
that
right?
Suzy.
Friend
of
Alex's.
Yeah,
yeah.
I
know
exactly.

What
was
the
description?

Mostly
positive,
Negative
only
in
terms
of
character.
I've
been
told
to
avoid
you.
BY
Whom?
Alexander.
He
says
you're
a
bad
boy.
Alexander
doesn't
know
I
was.
I'm
not
any
more.
The
new
me
is
very
professional.
-
All
very
dull.
But
according
to
the
team,

"The
best
way
to
Is
that
what
you
were
doing
Yes,
visualisation
techniques,
in
this

which
is
up
next.
Personally,
I've
always
been
a
great
putting
my
foot
down

But
they
don't
want
me
They
want
my
body
like
a
temple
And
what
about
your
soul,
your
heart?
Well,
they've
got
ideas
about
that,
too.
They
want
me
to
stop
messing
around,
get
married
They
think
it
would
be
good
for
me.
Hmm.
What
do
you
think?
-
It
sounds
fucking
awful.
But
since
they're
right
-they're
probably
right
about
that,
too.
You
don't
fancy
getting
married,
do
you?

-



Suzy.

Bravo!
Hey,
hey,
hey!
-
What's
going
on
with
him?
Didn't
want
to
ruin
your
day.
It's.
..
It's
the
Kraut.
What
about
him?
He's
just
been
signed
by
Ferrari.
You're
kidding
me?
Did
he
buy
his
way
in
there,
too?
Well,
the
old
man
took
Regazzoni
back
He
says
that
Niki's
a
genius
It's
terrible.
Drives
like
a
pig.
-
Oh,
you
can't
say
that.
-
It's

are

The

It's

it
isn't
It's

Which
is
why

are

me.
If
I
had
more
talent
and
could
earn
I
would.
How
do
you

you
will
Not
yet,
but
I
will.
If
you
can,
I
can.
You
know,
are
you
ever
not
an
asshole?
ï¬‚aughs)
-
Why
am
I
an
asshole?
You
know,
by
now
and
better
at
setting
up
the
car.
You
can't
deal
with
it,
Screw
you.
I
brought
you
along
today
because
I
thought
if
I
introduced
you
that
could
rub
off
on
you.
Forget
it.
Make
your
own
friends.
Come
on,
Clay.
I'm
sorry.





Are
you

Yes.
Can
you

Tu

-
Yes.

-
Actually,
we
do,
yeah.
It's
my
honour,
Niki,
please.
-
Thank
you.
On
one
condition,
though.
But
if
you
drive
it,

-
Niki

Will
someone
please
tell
me
Who
are

Should

you.
Anyway,
look
at
the
way
he's
driving,

There's
no
need
to
drive
fast.
It
just
increases
We're
not
in
a

Right
now,
why
would
I

Because

more
They're
absolutely
side
by
side,
So
evenly
matched.
Fantastic
battle
Hunt
is
now
ahead
once
more.
But
Lauda's
coming
back
again
now.
And
again
he
runs
wide.
-
Suzy,
we're
ready,
come
on.
-
Can
we
go,
yeah?
We're
in
the
closing
laps
They
come
down
the
hill.

And
Hunt's
got
a
problem!
Hunt
pulls
across
to
the
left.
Lauda
goes
ahead
on
his
own.
A
sad
end
to
a
wonderful
battle.
Hunt
pushing
off
the
marshal.
The
chequered
flag
The
title
going
to
Niki
Lauda,
who
wins
the
race,
who
wins
the
World
Championship.

-
Congratulations.
Marlene.

With
a
car
like
that,
the
rest
of
us
Maybe
the
fact
the
car
is
so
good
Come
on,
Niki.
You're
in
a
Ferrari.
Equal
terms,
-
I'd
beat
you
and
you
know
it.
You
might
win
one
race,
maybe
two,
But
in
the
long
run,
over
the
course
Right.
Why's
that?
Because
to
be
a
champion,
-
It's
the
whole
picture.
-
You're
just
a
charger
and
a
party
guy.
That's
why
everybody
likes
you.
Try
saying
that
ï¬‚aughs)
Why
would
I
be
jealous?
Think
about
it.
All
that
affection,
all
those
smiles
-is
a
sign
of
disrespect.
They
don't
fear
you.
Yes,
compared
to
you,
whom
no
one
likes.
-
Right.
Right.
Because
I'm
a
serious
guy.
I
go
to
bed
early,
-
Yes,
you're
very
well-behaved.
And
then,
after
the
race,
and
talk
all
this
bullshit
Arseholes?
You
should
go
home
more
often,
too.
I
heard
you
got
married.
Yes,
I
did.
So
where
is
she,
this
mysterious
wife?
-
In
New
York,
working.
You
know,
No?
Well,
maybe
that's
because
on
your
own,
looking
after
yourself,
Take
a
drink
on
me,
James.
Thank
you,
Niki.
I
mightjust
have
two.

Right,
Bubbles,
whatever
it
takes
to
beat
Your
word
is
my
command.
There
are
no
lengths
What
the
hell's
going
on?
Where
is
everybody?
What's
the
matter?

Do
you
know
what
the
date
is
today?
Yes,
it's
November,
the
14th.
Why?
Do
you
have
any
idea
I
don't
know.
Actually,
it's
the
deadline
for
the
forthcoming
Formula
1
season.
Yes?
Which
elapsed
at
midnight
last
night,
Well,
so?

Like
you
said,
condoms
and
cigarettes,

Right.
Except
we
are,
or
were.
I've
made
something
of
a
miscalculation.
The
economics,
Formula
1,
It
turns
out,
What
are
you
saying?
I'm
saying
it's
over,
Superstar.
The
banks
have
stepped
in,
Probably
have
to
sell
this
place.
Oh,
Christ.



I
need
a
drive,
Pete.
I
mean,

what
about
Lotus?
You
don't
wanna
know.

-
Actually,
I
do.
They
felt
your
reputation
preceded
you.
And
what
does
that
mean?

It's
my
other
line.

Peter
Hunt.
Fuck.
Don't
worry.
Something
will
turn
up.
Doubt
that
will
help
in
the
meantime.
Why
don't
we
go
away
at
the
weekend?
Skiing.
Before
I
go
back
to
New
York.
ï¬‚aughs)
Talk
to
me,
James.
You
know,
Suzy,
when
they
know
I
can't
watch
this.
What
were
you
hoping
for
anyway?
A
well-adjusted
knight
No
danger
of
that.
-
Let
me
give
you
some
advice.
Don't
go
to
men
who
are
willing
-looking
for
normality.
God
knows
I
walked
into
this
I
just
hoped
I'd
married
someone
who
was
half
as
impressive
At
least
there's
something
-
Oh,
James.
There
must
be
a
moisturiser
that
needs
your
vapid
mush
to
flog
it.



-
Hello?
It's
Peter.
Something's
up
at
McLaren.
-
What
have
you
heard?
I
heard
Emerson's
off.
Jesus.
Get
me
in
there,
Pete.
Say
anything,
just
get
me
in
that
room.

I'll
come
straight
to
the
point.
-
Our
esteemed
lead
driver...
...has
ditched
us
for
another
team

Coper-fucking-sucar.
ASA-fucking-P.

Fortunately,
a
few
hands
-
Jacky
lckx.
-
But
he's
consistent,
dependable.
Right,
and
will
he
go
for
that
gap
Will
he
put
his
life
on
the
line

The
sponsors
like
him.

What
do
you
want,
-
We
wanna
be
successful.
But
that
means
beating
Niki
Lauda,

Everyone
has.
-
You
really
think
you
can
beat
him?
It's
the
only
car
out
there
Which
is
why
I'm
here,
begging.
Look,
I'll
do
whatever
you
ask.
I'll
put
on
a
tie,
say
the
right
things.
I
can
beat
this
guy,
trust
me.
Just
give
me
the
drive.

Yeah.
And,
yeah,
he
will
drive
you
all
mad,
but
in
terms
of
raw
talent
there
is
no
better
driver
in
the
world.
He's
the
real
thing,
Teddy.
-
He's
what
we
all
came
into
this
for.
Nine
days
out
of
ten
but
on
that
tenth
day,
And
that
is
the
day
you
will
wish
You
will
never
win
the
championship
You
just
might
with
James.



Welcome
to
SÃ©o
Paulo,
Brazil,
for
the
first
race
where
the
main
news
is
that
James
Hunt
beating
Niki
Lauda's
Ferrari
by
just
two
hundredths
of
a
second.

New
car.
-
Inoficed.
I
noticed
that,
too.
Level
playing
field
now,
Yeah.
Let's
see
where
we
are
Let's
see
where
we
are
Hunt
has
the
pit
lane
pole
position,
which
should
give
him
the
best
chance
If
ever
there
was
a
doubt
about
whether
Lauda
had
Hunt
and
his
McLaren


Here
in
South
Africa,
James
Hunt
is
determined
to
make
amends
after
that
disastrous
retirement
But
it's
Lauda
who
takes
the
flag
James
Hunt
comes
home
second
to
confirm
his
championship
and
score
his
first
points
of
the
season.
That
wind
you
can
feel
Next
time
I'll
have
you.
We'll
see
in
Spain.


James
Hunt
finally
takes
here
in
Spain,
after
a
brilliant
drive.
It
was
only
a
matter
of
time.
Luca,
don't
you
think
it's
time

-it's
too
wide.
-
What?

How
can
we
be
disqualified?
-1.5
centimetres.

Giustissimo.

You
fucking...

...McLaren
M23

Just
make
it
narrower.
I
don't
care
how.

New
rear
suspension.
I
wanna
make
sure
Well,
then
we'd
better
move
the

With
the
oil
coolers
back,
the

Fuck.

What
the
fuck



And
with
Hunt
disqualified
his
championship
year
is
not
going
well.
And
now
it's
all
gone
wrong
His
engine
is
smoking.


Smoke
pouring
And
James
Hunt
is
out!
-
Can
you
tell
us
what
happened?
We've
taken
a
great
car,
and
overnight
turned
it
into

Shit!
What
the
hell
have
you
done?
It's
fucking
undriveable!
James,
look,
if
there's
a
problem
The
car
is
a
piece
of
shit.
-
We
are
appealing
it.
-
They're
killing
us
out
there.
-
You're
a
wanker.

You're
a
fucking
wanker.

But
this
was
a
good
race
for
you,
It's
good
for
everyone
that
the
quickest
car
James,
you're
50
points
You've
had
another
retirement
today.
Oh,
it's
dirty
politics
that's
what's
going
wrong.

So,
as
we
approach
in
this
year's
Formula
1
season,
Ferrari
and
Niki
Lauda
and
James
Hunt
and
McLaren
So,
five
races
in,
It's
fine.
Just
got
a
little
problem
and
his
team
of
Italian
cheats
-who
have
destroyed
my
car.
I'm
talking
about
the
race
in
Spain
-
Yeah,
in
a
car
which
is
not
legal.
You
know
that
doesn't
have
But
you
complained
and
your
team
Now
we've
had
to
rebuild
the
car,
-
At
least
it's
a
legal
monster.
You're
driving
an
illegal
car
-
Rules
are
rules.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Do
you
really
think
it
upsets
me,
James,
calling
me
a
rat
I
don't
mind
it.
Rats
are
ugly,
sure,
but
they're
very
intelligent
and
-
Wonderful.

No
wonder
she
left
him.

Anyone
seen
Suzy?
She's
supposed
to
be
here
today.
We,
er...didn't
wanna
tell
you
Tell
me
what?
Jesus.
Is
that
from
him?
Yeah.

So
when
did
all
this
start?
That
weekend
I
went
skiing.
Why
have
you
come
here,
James?
I've
come
to
get
you
back.
You
don't
want
me
back.
You
never
wanted
to
be
married
-
Yes,
I
did.
You
did
it
because
settle
you
down,
help
with
the
racing.
No,
I
didn't.
And
who
knows?
or
the
dope
or
the
infidelity
it
might
even
have
worked.
-
But
when
it's
all
of
them...
No,
you're
not
terrible.
You're
just
who
you
are
God
help
anyone
who
wants
more.
ï¬‚aughs)
And
Richard
Burton,
You
know,
he
has
quite
What's
important
is
how
it
feels
to
me,
and
it
feels
like
he
adores
me.

James!
Are
you
and
Suzy
getting
back
together?

James,
how
do
you
feel...
My
wife
has
found
herself
-
I
mean,
lover,
which
makes
her
happy.
And
Mr
Burton
has
found
which
makes
him
happy.
Let's
hope
his
pockets
are
deep.
And
I've
found
a
way
to
be
single
without
it
costing
me
a
penny,
which
has
got
to
go
down
-




We
haven't
seen
from
James
Hunt
all
season
long.
Reports
have
been
coming
out
that
their
car
is
now
fully
legal



Never
mind
the
bloody
wets.
Hunt
has
really
closed
the
gap
on
Lauda
Niki
Lauda
is
under
real
pressure
as
they
go
up
the
hill

And
Hunt
is
in
front
of
Lauda!
So
James
Hunt
gets
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd,
the
first
Briton
to
win
a
British
Grand
Prix
at
Brands
Hatch
since
Jim
Clark
in
1964.

James,
at
the
moment
over
the
rest
of
the
field.
Big
balls.
Would
you...

Following
an
inquiry
of
driver
James
Hunt
it
has
been
decided
-to
overturn
this
disqualification...
...and
to
restore
his
victory

James!
James!

James,
a
few
weeks
ago
for
the
season
completely,
-
What's
changed?
not
all
of
which
I'm
prepared
butjustice
being
done
and
having
my
car



James!
James!

Welcome
to
the
legendary
Nurburgring.
This
is
a
14.2-mile
track,
complete
with
185
corners
and
bends.







Welcome
to
the
NUrburgring,
the
most
dangerous
circuit
In
Formula
1
it
is
known
The
weather
conditions
and
latest
reports
indicate
there
is
no
relief
in
sight.

Gentlemen.
Well,
gentlemen,
Thank
you.
Niki
Lauda.
Thank
you.
I
called
this
meeting
because,
the
Nurburgring
is
the
most
stupid,
and
dangerous
track
in
the
world.
You've
all
seen
the
rain
Now,
those
of
you
with
experience
know
to
be
even
remotely
acceptable
And
today,
with
the
rain,
so
I
called
this
meeting
to
-
Cancel
the
race?
There
would
be
no
change
as
far
as
points
is
concerned.
-
The
race
would
simply
be
cancelled.
If
the
race
is
cancelled,
That's
true,
you
leave
without
your
fee,

it
also
means
that
you
would
So,
I
can
see
why
Why?
There
would
be
No,
but
there
would
be
one
race
less
where
I,
or
anyone
else
here,
James
is
right.
This
is
just
tactics.

Maybe
he's
just
frightened.
Which
asshole
said
this?
Yes,
of
course
I'm
frightened,
I
accept,
every
time
I
get
in
my
car,
and
I
can
live
with
it,
but
not
one
per
cent
more.
And
today,
with
the
rain,
I
suppose
that
all
depends
I
have
the
track
record
here.
I
am
the
only
person
in
history
So,
actually,
it's
to
my
advantage
-
Because
I'm
quicker
than
all
of
you.
-
Come
on.


Come
on,
Niki,
let's
race.
Why
are
we
here,
Niki?
Come
on.


Well,
all
those
in
favour
All
those
in
favour
of
racing.

Gentlemen,
the
race
is
on.

Ridiculous.
You
know,
Niki,
every
now
and
then



In
places
but
following
a
drivers'
meeting,
a
decision
has
finally
been
taken.


The
race
is
going
ahead.


Niki!

One
minute
to
go.
Jochen's
going
on
slicks.

ls
Niki
gonna
change?
Then
we
stay
on
wets,
too.

-
Niki,
okay?
-
All
right,
fire
her
up.


This
season's
fight
for
has
so
far
been
the
story
of
two
men.
Thus
far,
it's
been
going
But
James
Hunt
He
is
on
pole
position
with

Lauda

grass.
Lauda
has
the
lead
at
the
moment.
Lauda
leads
into
the
first
corner.
Hunt
is
in
second
place.
Mass
storming
past
Hunt!
He
made
the
right
choice
Mass
passing
Lauda
now!
Jochen
Mass,
in
the
number
12

Jochen
Mass
the
clear
leader,
with
everybody
else
making
the
decision
to
change
tyres
He's
coming
in!
Come
on,
let's
go!
See?
I
told
you
to
go
on
slicks.
Fuck
off.
Where's
Niki?

Behind
you.
Come
on!
Come
on!
What's
going
on?
The
tyre-changing
frenzy
has
caused

Jochen
Mass

the
lead
now.
Quick!
Lauda
urging
his
mechanics
to
hurry.
Quicker,
quicker,
quicker!
It's
a
disaster!
Come
on!
What's
going
on,
you
assholes?


This
race
has
gone
wrong
for
him
so
far.
His
championship
rival,
James
Hunt,

He's
just
going
past

Niki!


Get
me
out!
Help
me!

We
have
an
accident
Several
cars
are
involved.
Looks
like


Come
this

Keep
trying.


Come
this
way.






The

swept

worst
since

horrific

the
end

did.
He

Niki

was
trapped
in
a
searing
inferno

Do
we
have
any
change
this
morning?

Frau
Lauda.
Frau
Lauda?

-
Morning,
chaps.
Looking
good.

-
What's
going
on?
-
What
about
him?
-
What?


Niki.
It's
that
bad,
huh?
No.
In
hospital
I
asked
them
straight,
how
bad
my
appearance
would
be.
They
said
with
time
it
would
be
fine.
But
it
won't.
I
can
tell,
seeing
your
reaction.
I
will
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
You
know,
Niki,
I
tried
to
write
you
The
drivers'
meeting
in
Germany,
-
I
swayed
the
room.
That
race
should
never
have
gone
ahead.
No,
it
shouldn't.
So,
in
many
ways,
I
feel
responsible
You
were.
But,
trust
me...
watching
you
win
those
races
...you
were
equally
responsible
-
-
How
are
you
feeling,
Niki?
Niki,
can
you
confirm
to
us
exactly
and
the
expectations
for
your
recovery?
Sure.
I
had
a
skin
graft
operation,
where
they
put
half
my
right
thigh
Now,
it
doesn't
look
too
good,
it's
impossible
to
perspire
so
sweat
will
never
run
into
my
eyes

When
they
heard
about
your
condition,
Ferrari
immediately
hired
Yeah,
before
even
reaching
the
hospital.

Yes,
and
keen
to
make
an
impression.
So,
let's
see
where
Mr
Reutemann

James
Hunt
and
McLaren
have
Yes.
So
is
there
a
question
now,

You
still
think
you
can
win?
Yes,
of
course.
-
I
have
the
better
car.
And
possibly
I'm
the
better
driver.
But
he's
a
clever
guy,
while
I
was
lying
half-dead
in
hospital

And
what
did
your
wife

Maybe
you
should
ask
Niki.
He's
the
World

Mr

I'm

For
James,
one

was

He
had
proved
what
he
needed
to

anyone
who
doubted
him.

he
retired.

I
wasn't
surprised.
I
was
just

always
think
of

He
