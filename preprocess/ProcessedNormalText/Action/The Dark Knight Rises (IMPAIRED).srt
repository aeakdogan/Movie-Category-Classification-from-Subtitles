GORDON:
I
was
his
friend.
And
it
will
be
a
very
long
time
before
I
believed
in
Harvey
Dent.
Dr.
Pavel,
I'm
CIA.
DRIVER:
-
Uh,
you
don't
get
to
bring
friends.
DRIVER:
CIA
OP:
And
why
DRIVER:
They
work
for
the
mercenary.
The
masked
man.
-
Bane?
Get
them
on
board.
I'll
call
it
in.
CIA
OP:
The
flight
plan
I
just
filed
...lists
me,
my
men,
Dr.
Pavel
here...
...but
only
one
of
you!
First
one
to
talk
gets
to
stay
Who
paid
you
to
grab
Dr.
Pavel?

He
didn't
fly
so
good!
Who
wants
to
try
next?
Tell
me
about
Bane!
Why
does
he
wear
the
mask?
A
lot
of
loyalty
for
a
hired
gun!
MAN:
Well,
perhaps
he's
wondering
...before
throwing
him
out
of
a
plane.
At
least
you
can
talk.
Who
are
you?
MAN:
What
matters
is
our
plan.
No
one
cared
who
I
was
If
I
pull
that
off,
will
you
die?
BANE:
You're
a
big
guy.
BANE:
Was
getting
caught
part
of
your
plan?
BANE:
Dr.
Pavel
refused
our
offer
-
We
had
to
find
out
what
he
told
you...
Well,
congratulations,
-
Sir?
-
Now
what's
the
next
BANE:
...with
no
survivors.

PILOT:


Aah!
What
you
doing
to
me?
Let
me
out!
No!
No,
no,
no!
No!

BANE:
No!
They
expect
one
of
us
Have
we
started
the
fire?
BANE:

Calm
down,
doctor.
That
comes
later.
MAYOR:
Harvey
Dent
Day
...but
we're
here
tonight
Harvey
Dent's
uncompromising
stand
...had
made
Gotham
...at
the
time
of
his
death,
This
city
has
seen
a
historic
turnaround.
No
city
is
without
crime,
...without
organized
crime
...gave
law
enforcement
teeth
Now
people
are
talking
about
...and
to
them
I
say,
"Not
on
my
watch."

I
want
to
thank
the
Wayne
Foundation
I'm
told
Mr.
Wayne
couldn't
be
here
And
now
I'm
gonna
give
way
CONGRESSMAN:
You
ever
lay
eyes
on
Wayne
No
one
has.
Not
in
years.
MAYOR:...
people
put
their
faith
A
thug
who
showed
his
true
nature...
...when
he
betrayed
the
trust
...and
murdered
him
in
cold
blood.
Sweetheart,
not
so
fast
with
the
chow.
-
Shrimp
balls?
Jim
Gordon
can
tell
you
the
truth
about
Commissioner
Gordon.
GORDON:
I
have...
...written
a
speech...
...telling
the
truth
about
Harvey
Dent.
Maybe
the
time
isn't
right.
Maybe
right
now...
...all
you
need
to
know
...1000
inmates
in
Blackgate
Prison
These
are
violent
criminals,
essential
cogs
Maybe,
for
now,
all
I
should
say
It
has
not
been
for
nothing.

MAID
1:
You
see
the
guy
who
owns
the
house?
-
...he
never
leaves
the
east
wing.
-
Yeah,
that
he's
disfigured.
He
has
Why
are
your
people
And
where's
Mrs.
Bolton?
SELINA:
The
east
drawing
room.
Unlock
the
door,
put
the
tray
on
the
table,
ALFRED:
I'm
sorry,
Miss
Tate.
And
you
mustn't
take
it
personally.
Everyone
knows
that
Wayne's
holed
up
...peeing
into
Mason
jars.
It's
very
good
of
you
DAGGETT:
Why
are
you
wasting
your
time
...who
threw
away
your
investment
He
can't
get
your
money
back.
I
can.
I
could
try
explaining
that
...is
worth
investing
in,
Mr.
Daggett.
But
you
understand
only
money
...so
why
waste
my
time
indeed?
GORDON:
You
should
spend
more
time
Well,
that's
your
department.
CONGRESSMAN:
He
goes
by
his
gut
and
it
bothers
him,
Must
be
popular
with
his
wife.
Not
really.
She
took
the
kids
to
Cleveland.
He'll
have
plenty
of
time
for
visits.
-
Really?
-
But
he's
a
hero.

Oh,
sorry,
sorry.
It
is
Mr.
Wayne,
isn't
it?
Although
you
don't
have
the
long
nails
Is
that
what
they
say
about
me?
It's
just
that
no
one
ever
sees
you.
That's
a
beautiful
necklace.
Reminds
me
It
can't
be
the
same
one...
...because
her
pearls
are
in
this
safe...
...the
manufacturer
clearly
explained...
...is
uncrackable.
Oops.
Nobody
told
me
it
was
uncrackable.
I'm
afraid
I
can't
let
you
take
those.
Look,
you
wouldn't
beat
up
a
woman
Of
course,
sometimes
Good
night,
Mr.
Wayne.
Can
I
have
a
ride?
You
read
my
mind.
Let's
go.
ALFRED:
WAYNE:
And
quite
lovely,
-
I
wasn't.
Examining
print
dust.
And
this
is
your
idea
She
took
the
pearls,
-
She?
Perhaps
you
should
stop
letting
them
Perhaps
you
should
start
learning
-
Why
were
you
dusting
for
prints?
She
was.
Sir.
Congressman
Gilly's
wife
The
congressman
never
made
it
home
That's
a
job
for
the
police?
When
you
and
Dent
cleaned
the
streets,
Pretty
soon
we'll
be
chasing
down,
uh,

And
yet
here
you
are,
-
What's
your
name,
son?
You
have
something
you
want
to
ask
me?
It's
about
that
night.
This
night,
The
last
confirmed
sighting
of
the
Batman.
He
murders
those
people,
...breaks
Dent's
neck
I'm
not
hearing
a
question,
son.
Don't
you
want
to
know
who
he
was?
I
know
exactly
who
he
was.
He
was
the
Batman.

Let's
go
see
about
the
congressman's
wife.
ALFRED:
Master
Wayne?
You
haven't
been
down
here
in
a
long
time.
Trying
to
find
out
more
about
Unless
she's
lost
a
lot
of
weight...
...she
was
wearing
She's
good.
She
may
be,
but
we
have
a
trace
We
do.
I
cross-referenced
the
address
...with
police
data
Selina
Kyle.
The
databases
are
full
of
close-calls,
She's
good,
but
the
ground
We
should
send
the
police
She
won't.
She
likes
them
too
much.
And
they
weren't
what
she
was
after.
-
What
was
she
after?
It
was
printer
toner
It
gives
a
good
pull
and
it's
untraceable.
Fascinating.
You
two
should
You're
trying
to
set
me
up
At
this
point,
I'd
set
you
up
if
it
brought
you
back
to
the
world.
There's
nothing
out
there
for
me.
And
that's
the
problem.
You
hung
up
your
cape
and
your
cowl
You
never
went
to
find
a
life.
Alfred...
...I
did
find
someone.
I
know,
and
you
lost
them.
But
that's
all
part
of
living,
sir.
But
you're
not
living,
you're
just
waiting,
Remember
when
you
left
Gotham?
Before
all
this,
before
Batman?
You
were
gone
seven
years.
Seven
years
I
waited,
Every
year,
I
took
a
holiday.
There's
this
caf
Every
fine
evening
I'd
sit
there
I
had
this
fantasy...
...that
I
would
look
across
the
tables...
...and
I'd
see
you
there,
with
a
wife.
Maybe
a
couple
of
kids.
You
wouldn't
say
anything
to
me,
But
we'd
both
know
that
you'd
made
it.
That
you
were
happy.
I
never
wanted
you
to
come
back
to
Gotham.
I
always
knew
there
was
nothing
here
And
I
wanted
something
I
still
do.
DWP
MAN:
They
wash
up
here
More
when
it
gets
colder.
Homeless,
sheltering
in
the
tunnels.
We
pulled
him
from
the
basin,
ROSS:
What?
He's
from
St.
Swithin's.
It's
the
boys'
home
REILLY:
BLAKE:
No?
Why?
He
aged
out.
We
don't
have
the
resources
I
thought
the
Wayne
Foundation
Not
for
the
past
couple
of
years.
-
He
has
a
brother
here,
doesn't
he?
I'd
like
to,
if
that's
all
right.
You
know
what
he
was
doing
Lot
of
guys
been
going
down
the
tunnels
Say
you
can
live
down
there.
Say
there's
work
down
there.
Work?
What
kind
of
work
are
you
More
than
you
can
find
up
here,
I
guess.
BLAKE:
Of
course.
Do
you
think
he's
coming
back?
I
don't
know.
STRYVER:
I
like
having
someone
around
Right
hand.
No
partials.
-
Very
nice.
Not
so
fast,
handsome.
You
got
something
for
me?
Ah,
yes.

I
don't
know
what
you're
planning
to
do
...but
I'm
guessing
you'll
need
his
thumb.
You
don't
count
so
good,
huh?
I
count
fine.
In
fact,
I'm
counting
to
10
right
now.
Okay.
My
friend's
outside.
Just
hit
"send."

This
place
is
a
little
dead.
It'll
liven
up
in
a
minute.
Trust
me.
Is
everything
okay?
Great.
Catch
you
later.

Hmm.
It
would
have
been
a
lot
easier...
...to
just
give
me
what
we
agreed.
We
can't
have
loose
ends.
And
even
in
that
dress,
SELINA:
But
my
friend
over
there?
Every
cop
in
the
city's
missing
him.
STRYVER:
But
they're
not
gonna
be
looking
I
don't
know.

SWAT
1:
Go!
SWAT
3:

SELINA:
Help
me,
please!
Please
help
me!


Keep
some
pressure
on
that,
sweetheart.
Call
me?
BLAKE:
You
okay,
miss?
I
got
the
congressman.

SWAT
4:
GORDON:
Manhole!
Get
this
up!
You
three,
down
with
me.
You
two,
you
go
down,
What,
they
went
down
there?

-
We're
gonna
go
down
there,
right?
-
Wasn't
gas.
It's
a
sewer.
We
know,
sir.
The
police
commissioner.
Someone
get
this
hothead
out
of
here?
And
where's
that
DWP
guy?
BANE:

Answer
him.
BANE:
It's
the
police
commissioner.
BANE:
MERCENARY
1:
We
didn't
know
what
to
do.
And
your
weakness
has
cost
the
lives
No,
he's
alone.

BANE:
Then
I
will
kill
you.

-
He's
dead.
The
water
runs
to
any
one
of
the
outflows.
BANE:
Follow
him!

You
okay?
You
okay?
Hey,
hey,
you
awake?


I
need
to
see
Bruce
Wayne.
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Wayne
doesn't
take
Even
from
a
police
officer.
And
if
I
go
get
a
warrant
for
That
still
count
as
unscheduled?
WAYNE:
BLAKE:
He
chased
a
gunman
When
I
pulled
him
out,
he
was
babbling
A
masked
man
called
Bane.
Shouldn't
you
be
telling
They
asked
me
if
he
saw
He
needs
you.
He
needs
the
Batman.
-
If
Commissioner
Gordon
thinks...
But
we've
met
before.
It
was
a
long
time
ago.
I
was
a
kid.
It
used
to
be
funded
by
My
mom
died
when
I
was
small.
It
was
But
my
dad
got
shot
a
couple
years
later
...and
I
remember
that
one
just
fine.
Not
a
lot
of
people
know
To
be
angry...
...in
your
bones.
I
mean,
they
understand.
Foster
parents.
Everybody
understands...
...for
a
while.
And
then
they
want
the
angry
little
kid
Move
on.
So
after
a
while,
They
send
the
angry
kid
to
a
boys'
home.
I
figured
it
out
too
late.
Practice
smiling
in
a
mirror.
It's
like
putting
on
a
mask.
So
you
showed
up
this
one
day,
Pretty
girl
on
your
arm.
We
were
so
excited.
Bruce
Wayne,
billionaire
orphan.
I
mean,
we
used
to
make
up
stories
And,
you
know,
with
the
other
kids,
Right
when
I
saw
you,
I'd
seen
that
look
on
your
face
before.
It's
the
same
one
I
taught
myself.
I
don't
know
why
you
took
the
fall
...but
I'm
still
a
believer
...even
if
you're
not.
Why
did
you
say
that
your
boys'
home
used
BLAKE:
Might
be
time
to
get
some
fresh
air.
Some
of
those
details
WAYNE:
ALFRED:
He's
a
mercenary.
Him
and
his
men
were
behind
...that
secured
mining
operations
WAYNE:
Now
Daggett's
brought
them
here.
-
I'll
keep
digging.
Alfred,
why
did
the
Wayne
Foundation
The
foundation
is
funded
by
There
have
to
be
some.
-
Time
to
talk
to
Mr.
Fox,
I
think.
No,
no,
no.
Do
we
still
have
Yes.
One
or
two.
I
need
an
appointment
at
the
hospital
-
Which
hospital?
DOCTOR:
I
have
seen
worse
cartilage
No.
That's
because
there
is
And
not
much
of
any
use
Between
that
and
the
scar
tissue
...the
residual
concussive
damage
...and
the
general
scarred-over
quality
-
...I
cannot
recommend
that
We
were
in
this
together...
...then
you
were
gone.
WAYNE:
-
We
won.
And
now
there's
evil
rising
The
Batman
has
to
come
back.
What
if
he
doesn't
exist
anymore?
He
must.
He
must.
YUPPIE:
-
You
f...
You
took
my
wallet!
-
Get
out.
-
Now.
I
don't
know
what
he's
so
upset
about.
Probably
the
watch.


MAN
1:
MAN
2:
A
stiff
can
barely
climb
out
-
No,
that's
Bruce
Wayne!


WAYNE:
I'm
not
sure
if
my
assistant...
Thank
you
so
much.

MIRANDA:
Miss
Tate,
isn't
it?
Even
before
you
became
a
recluse,
The
proceeds
go
to
the
big
fat
spread.
It's
about
feeding
the
ego
Actually,
this
is
my
party,
Mr.
Wayne.
Oh.
And
the
proceeds
will
go
where
they
should,
because
I
paid
for
the
big
fat
That's
very
generous
of
you.
You
have
to
invest
if
you
want
to
restore
Take
our
clean-energy
project.
Sometimes
the
investment
-
I'm
sorry.
But
a
man
who
doesn't
care
about
the
world
And
isn't
so
wounded
when
it
fails...
...that
he
goes
into
hiding.
Have
a
good
evening,
Mr.
Wayne.
WAYNE:
Thank
you.

-
You
don't
seem
happy
to
see
me.
I
felt
like
some
fresh
air.
Why
didn't
you
call
the
police?
I
have
a
powerful
friend
That's
a
brazen
costume
for
a
cat
burglar.
Yeah?
Who
are
you
pretending
to
be?
Bruce
Wayne,
eccentric
billionaire.
-
Who's
your
date?
She
left
her
diamonds
behind,
though.
It's
pronounced
"Ibiza."
You
wouldn't
want
these
folks
realizing
You
think
I
care
what
anyone
I
doubt
you
care
what
anyone
Don't
condescend,
Mr.
Wayne.
Well,
Selina
Kyle,
I
know
you
came
here
A
modest
place
for
a
master
jewel
thief.
Which
means
that
either
...or
you're
in
deep
with
the
wrong
people.
You
don't
get
to
judge
me
because
you
were
-
Actually,
I
was
born
in
the
Regency
Room.
Once
you've
done
what
you
had
to,
Start
fresh.
Ugh.
Any
12-year-old
with
a
cell
phone
Everything
we
do
is
collated
Is
that
how
you
justify
stealing?
I
take
what
I
need
from
those
I
don't
stand
on
the
shoulders
Robin
Hood?
I
think
I'd
do
more
to
help
someone
than
You
think
maybe
you're
assuming
Maybe
you're
being
unrealistic
about
what's
really
in
your
pants
Ouch.
You
think
all
this
can
last?
You
and
your
friends
better
batten
down
...you're
all
gonna
wonder
how
you
...and
leave
so
little
for
the
rest
of
us.
You
sound
like
I'm
adaptable.
Those
pearls
do
look
better
on
you
But
I
still
can't
let
you
keep
them.
MAN:
Not
likely.
Must
have
lost
my
ticket.
-
Your
wife
said
you
were
taking
Just
you,
sir?
Don't
worry,
Master
Wayne.
Takes
a
little
time
to
get
back
Bruce
Wayne,
as
I
live
and
breathe.
What
brings
you
out
of
cryo-sleep,
You
haven't
lost
your
sense
of
humor.
Even
if
you
have
lost
most
of
my
money.
Actually,
you
did
that.
If
you
funnel
your
entire
R
and
D
budget...
...into
a
fusion
project
...your
company
is
unlikely
to
thrive.
What
are
my
options?
Well,
if
you're
unwilling
I
can't.
I
can't,
Lucius.
Well,
then
sit
tight.
Your
majority
keeps
Daggett
at
bay...
...while
we
figure
out
a
future
for
She
has
supported
the
project
She's
smart.
And
quite
lovely.
We
all
just
want
what's
best
for
you,
Show
her
the
machine.
I'll
think
it
over.
Anything
else?
Nope.
Why?
These
conversations
used
to
end
I
retired.
Mm-hm.
Well,
let
me
show
you
Just
for
old
times'
sake.
WAYNE:
I
figured
you'd
have
FOX:
WAYNE:
FOX:
set
up
14
different
defense
subsidiaries.
For
years,
I've
been
shuttering
...all
the
different
prototypes
-
My
roof.
Keep
them
from
falling
Oh,
now
you're
just
showing
off.
Defense
Department
projects
Rotors
are
configured
to
maneuver
What's
it
called?
Oh,
it
has
a
long,
uninteresting
I
just
took
to
calling
it
the
Bat.
And,
yes,
Mr.
Wayne,
it
does
come
in
black.
Works
fine,
except
for
the
autopilot.
Takes
a
better
mind
than
mine
to
fix
it.
Better
mind?
Well,
I
was
trying
to
be
modest.
A
less
busy
mind.
Yours.

ALFRED:
Is
it
really
painful?
Happy
watching.
Thank
you,
sir.
Not
bad.
Not
bad
at
all.
If
you're
seriously
considering
...you
should
hear
the
rumors
WAYNE:
There
is
a
prison
A
pit
where
men
are
thrown
But
sometimes
Sometimes
the
pit
sends
something
back.
WAYNE:
Bane.
Born
and
raised
in
hell
on
earth.
-
Born
in
a
prison?
But
they
do
know
that
once
he
did...
...he
was
trained
by
Ra's
Al
Ghul,
Bane
was
a
member
And
then
he
was
excommunicated.
And
any
man
who
is
too
extreme
I
didn't
realize
I
was
known
That
was
then.
And
you
can
strap
up
your
leg
...but
that
doesn't
make
you
If
this
man
is
everything
that
you
say
The
city
needs
Bruce
Wayne.
Your
resources.
Your
knowledge.
It
doesn't
need
your
body,
or
your
life.
That
time's
past.
You're
afraid
that
if
I
go
back
out
there,
No.
I'm
afraid
that
you
want
to.


TRADER:
You
can't
short
the
stock
because
Wayne
coming
back
is
change.
On
what
basis?
I
flipped
a
coin.
It
says
rye...
I
said
no
rye,
man.
Hey,
rookie,
lose
the

Come

Let's

Then

Close

You

You

STRYVER:

He
said,
and
I
quote,
Where
does
he
find

Open

And
can
we
get
some

CATWOMAN:

You
dumb

Nobody
ever
accused
me
You're
dumb
for
coming
here
tonight.

I
want
what
you
owe
me.

Want
doesn't
get.
Nice
outfit.
-
I
don't
know.
Do
they?
-
So
where
is
it?
The
program.
The
"clean
slate."
The
ultimate
tool
for
a
master
thief
BODYGUARD:

Where
is
it?
The
clean
slate?
Where
you
type
in
someone's
name,
...in
a
few
minutes
they're
gone
-
Sound
a
little
too
good
to
be
true?
Rykin
Data
took
it
to
prototype
stage.
That's
why
I
bought
them.
But
they
had
nothing.
It
was
a
gangland
myth.
CATWOMAN:
I'm
not
bluffing!
BATMAN:
They
just
don't
care.
You've
gotta
be
kidding
me.
-
No
guns.
No
killing.
My
mother
warned
me
about
This
isn't
a
car.
See
you
around.
You're
welcome.
I
had
it
under
control.
Those
weren't
street
thugs.
They
were
trained
killers.
I
saved
your
life.
In
return,
I
need
to
know
what
you
did
Wayne
wasn't
kidding
about
I
sold
his
prints
to
Daggett...
...for
something
that
doesn't
even
exist.
I
doubt
many
people
get
the
better
of
you.
Hey,
when
a
girl's
desperate...
-
What's
he
gonna
do
with
them?
...but
Daggett
seemed
pretty
interested

Miss
Kyle?
So
that's
what
that
feels
like.
I
see
from
the
television
coverage
that
you
I
retrieved
this.
Aren't
the
police
supposed
-
They
don't
have
the
tools
to
analyze
it.
One
man's
tool
is
another
man's
weapon.
In
your
mind,
perhaps.
But
there
aren't
Alfred,
enough.
Perhaps
they
might
have
if
you
You
thought
I
didn't
have
it
in
me.
You
led
a
bloated
police
force
...with
a
load
of
fancy
new
toys
from
Fox.
What
about
when
you
come
up
I'll
fight
harder.
I
always
have.
Look.
I
see
the
power
of
belief.
I
see
the
League
of
Shadows
resurgent.
You
said
he
was
excommunicated.
By
Ra's
Al
Ghul.
Who
leads
them
now?
Ra's
Al
Ghul
was
the
League
of
Shadows
Bane
is
a
mercenary.
Trades
of
some
kind.
Coded.
And
my
fingerprint,
Get
this
to
Fox.
He
can
crack
the
code
and
tell
us
I'll
get
this
to
Mr.
Fox,
but
no
more.
I've
sewn
you
up,
I've
set
your
bones,
I've
buried
enough
members
-
You'll
leave
me?
Leaving
is
all
I
have
You're
not
Batman
anymore.
You
used
to
talk
about
finishing,
Alfred,
Rachel
died
knowing
that
That
was
my
life
beyond
the
cave.
She...
She
didn't.
She
couldn't.
What
if
she
had?
She...
I
can't
change
that.
What
if
before
she
died
...saying
she
chose
And
what
if...
...to
spare
you
pain...
...I
burnt
that
letter?
How
dare
you
use
Rachel
to
try
to
stop
me?
I
am
using
the
truth,
Master
Wayne.
Maybe
it's
time
we
all
stopped
trying
to
-
I'm
sorry.
You
expect
to
destroy
my
world...
...and
then
think
that
No,
no,
no.
I
know
what
this
means.
What
does
it
mean?
It
means
your
hatred.
And
it
also
means
losing
someone
...since
I
first
heard
his
cries
echo...
...through
this
house.
But
it
might
also
mean
saving
your
life.
And
that
is
more
important.
Goodbye,
Alfred.

Alfred?

Answering

minutes,
MIRANDA:
You
brought
me
out
here
FOX:
Please
keep
hands
and
feet
inside
This
is
it,
isn't
it?
The
reactor
is
beneath
the
river...
...so
it
can
be
instantly
flooded
Is
Bruce
Wayne
really
that
paranoid?
FOX:
WAYNE:
I
thought
you
might
like
to
see
MIRANDA:
Free
clean
energy
for
an
entire
city.
MIRANDA:
Three
years
ago,
...on
weaponized
fusion
reactions.
One
week
later,
your
reactor
I
think
this
machine
works.
Miranda,
if
it
were
operational,
Would
it
make
you
feel
better
to
know
...died
in
a
plane
crash
six
months
ago?
Someone
will
work
out
what
Dr.
Pavel
did.
Someone
will
figure
out
a
way
to
make
I
need
you
to
take
control
...and
this
reactor.
To
do
what
with
it?
Nothing.
Until
we
can
guarantee
its
safety.
And
if
we
can't?
Decommission
it.
Flood
it.
Destroy
the
world's
best
chance
If
the
world's
not
ready,
yes.
Bruce,
if
you
want
to
save
the
world,
I'm
trusting
you.
Doesn't
count.
You
have
no
choice.
I
could
have
flooded
this
chamber
I'm
choosing
to
trust
you.
Please.

All
right,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
DAGGETT:
I'd
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
...which
is
highly
irregular,
Bruce
Wayne's
family
built
this
company.
And
he
himself
has
run
it.
Into
the
ground,
sir!
Check
the
share
price
this
morning.
Crazy
gambling
on
futures
has
not
...it's
cost
us
all
a
lot
of
money.
And
he
has
to
go.
I'm
afraid
he
has
a
point,
Mr.
Wayne.
Now,
back
to
business.

Not

Where's
Bane?

Where
is

he
shall
appear.
What
the

is
going

How
exactly
is
that
supposed
to

BANE:
Leave
us.
I'm
in

BANE:
I've
paid

a
small

BANE:
What

Your

To

-
You
didn't
have
any

You
just
don't
realize
how
much
The
idea
was
to
be
a
symbol.
Batman
could
be
anybody.
That
was
the
point.
-
Well,
it
was
damn
good
to
see
him
back.
-
They'll
figure
that
out
in
the
end.
Yeah.
I
got
500
pages
of
tunnel
records
I
could
use
some
help,
actually.
You
know
what?
Drop
me
in
Old
Town.
WAYNE:
JEN:
That's
the
way
this
works!
-
That
is
the
way...
And
he
doesn't
have
a
cent
Yeah,
it's
not
much.
Actually,
The
rich
don't
even
go
broke
My
powerful
friend
might
hope
-
And
how
would
he
do
that?
-
It
doesn't
exist.
He
wants
to
meet
tonight.
Why?
He
needs
to
find
Bane.
-
Tell
him
I'll
think
about
it.
I
like
your
place.
Mr.
Wayne?
I'm
sorry
they
took
all
your
money.
No,
you're
not.
FOLEY:
Can
we
help
you,
officer?
John
Daggett's
body
was
just
found
-
Thought
you
might
want
to
know.
His
name's
all
over
these
permits
I
just
pulled
to,
uh,
That's
MTA
maintenance,
uh,
Where
did
you
get
to
Remind
me
to
tell
detail
We've
had
teams
down
there.
Well,
get
more
men.
Work
a
grid.
Yeah,
the,
uh,
masked
man.
We're
on
it.
Lose
the
uniform,
We
could
use
some
hotter
heads
-
Sir,
that
could
also
be
a
coincidence.
You're
not
allowed
to
believe

MIRANDA:
No.
I'm
on
my
own
now.
Do
you
have
keys?
Never
needed
them.
Hope
you
didn't
like
me
for
my
money.
MIRANDA:
I'll
take
care
of
your
parents'
legacy,
Who's
this?
Where's
Alfred?
He
left...
...taking
everything.
What's
that?
My
power's
been
shut
off.

WAYNE:
When
I
was
a
child,
But
on
the
nights
when
we
had
a
fire,
I
assumed
your
family
was
wealthy.
Not
always.
Not
when
I
was
young.
An
old
mistake.
I've
made
a
few
myself.
More
than
a
few.
We
could
leave.
Tonight.
Take
my
plane,
go
anywhere
we
wanted.
Someday,
perhaps.
Not
tonight.
Don't
be
shy.
Wayne
says
you
can
get
me
-
That
depends.
On
what
you
want
it
for.
I
acquired
it
to
keep
it
out
Still
don't
trust
me,
huh?
How
can
we
change
that?
Start
by
taking
me
to
Bane.
You
asked.
From
here,
And
they're
not
your
average
brawlers.
BATMAN:
-
He's
behind
you.
BATMAN:
MERCENARY

CATWOMAN:
I
had
to
find
a
way
to
stop
them
You
made
a
serious
mistake.
BANE:
Bane.
BANE:
...Mr.
Wayne.
Peace
has
cost
you
your
strength.
Victory
has
defeated
you.


BANE:
Theatricality
and
deception,
But
we
are
initiated,
aren't
we,
Bruce?
Members
of
the
League
of
Shadows.
And
you
betrayed
us.
BATMAN:
...by
a
gang
of
psychopaths.
BANE:
And
I'm
here
to
fulfill
You
fight
like
a
younger
man.
Nothing
held
back.
Admirable,
but
mistaken.
Oh,
you
think
darkness
is
your
ally?
But
you
merely
adopted
the
dark.
I
was
born
in
it.
Molded
by
it.
I
didn't
see
the
light
By
then,
it
was
nothing
to
me
The
shadows
betray
you
I
will
show
you
where
...whilst
preparing
to
bring
justice.
Then
I
will
break
you.
Your
precious
armory.
Gratefully
accepted.
We
will
need
it.
Ah,
yes.
I
was
wondering

Your
spirit...
...or
your
body.
Get
me
Commissioner
Gordon.
I
got
a
line
-
Excuse
me,
miss.
I'm
gonna
need
to
see
your
ticket
Oh.
Do
you
mind?
I
showed
your
picture
to
Don't
tell
me.
Still
in
love?
Oh,
head
over
heels.
You've
made
some
mistakes,
Ms.
Kyle.
-
Girl's
gotta
eat.
Why
would
you
run?
Maybe
it's
not
you
I'm
running
from.
Who
then?
Bane?
What
do
you
know
about
him?
That
you
should
be
as
afraid
of
him
We
can
offer
you
protection.
Okay.
When
I
spotted
you,
I
was
looking
Did
they
kill
him?
I'm
not
sure.

Why
didn't
you
just...
...kill
me?
BANE:
Your
punishment
must
be
more
severe.
Torture?
Yes.
But
not
of
your
body.
Of
your
soul.
Where
am
I?
BANE:
Where
I
learned
the
truth
about
despair.
As
will
you.
There
is
a
reason
why
this
prison
Hope.
Every
man
who
has
rotted
here
...has
looked
up
to
the
light
So
easy.
So
simple.
And
like
shipwrecked
men
turning
...many
have
died
trying.
I
learned
here
there
can
be
So
as
I
terrorize
Gotham...
...I
will
feed
its
people
hope
I
will
let
them
believe

that

can
watch

another
thing
coming.
Death,
then.

Looks
that
way.
Death...
...by
exile.

Hey,
we're
going
now.
Hey,
you
hear
me?
MERCENARY

a
spot,
MERCENARY
2:
We
all
do.
-
Bruce.
Picked
a
hell
of
a
time
to
go
on
vacation,
How
long
until
that
core
ignites?
That
bomb
goes
off
in
12
hours.
Unless
we
can
reconnect
it
to
the
reactor.
-
Can
you
get
Miranda
out
of
here?
-
Do
what's
necessary.
FOX:
What
for?
Sorry
to
spoil
things,
boys,
-
I
won't
forget
about
you,
Miranda.
I
like
your
girlfriend,
Mr.
Wayne.
He
should
be
so
lucky.
Any
move
I
make
on
Bane
or
the
bomb...
...the
triggerman
sets
it
off.
FOX:
Well,
they
won't
use
radio
or
cell.
Infrared
doesn't
have
the
range.
It'll
have
to
be
a
microburst.
Longwave.
-
Could
you
block
it?
But
I'll
need
the
EMP
cannon
Remember
where
you
parked?
She
fly
okay?
Yeah,
even
without
the
autopilot.

Thanks.
ROSS:
Okay.
It's
clear.
Come

quick.

Who

you?
BATMAN:
BOY:
Dad,
check
it
out.
BANE:
Keep
her
close.
He'll
come
for
her.
BATMAN:
Bane
took
her.
He's
holed
up
at
city
hall,
This
blocks
the
remote
detonator
signal
Get
it
onto
it
before
sunrise.
When
what
starts?
War.

You
missed
a
spot.
If
you're
working
alone,
wear
a
mask.
I'm
not
afraid
to
be
seen
The
mask
is
not
for
you.
Count
to
five,
then
throw.

No
offense,
but
you
got
-
What
now?
But
you
need
to
get
people
-
Why?
Lead
an
exodus.
You
don't
need
me
here?
You've
given
me
an
army.
Now
go.
Hey,
thanks.
Don't
thank
me
yet.
Well,
I
might
not
get
a
chance
later.
You
shouldn't
have.
BATMAN:
The
midtown
tunnel's
...but
the
cannons
have
enough
firepower
Wait
until
the
fighting
begins.
You're
gonna
wage
a
war
To
start
it,
throttle...

-
I
got
it.
No,
I've
got
45
minutes
to
get
clear
-
You
don't
stand
a
chance
against
I'll
open
that
tunnel,
then
I'm
gone.
There's
more
to
you
than
that.
Sorry
to
keep
letting
you
down.
Come
with
me.
Save
yourself.
You
don't
owe
these
people
any
more.
You've
given
them
everything.
Not
everything.
Not
yet.
MERCENARY
:
Disperse
or
be
fired
upon!
There's
only
one
police
in
this
town.

BANE:

-
Here
it
comes!
BANE:
No.
I
came
back
to
stop
you.
Now!
That's
impossible.
Cut
over
to
Fifth!
Here
you
go.
Get
on
the
bus.
Go
ahead.
You,
come
with
me.
You
too.
Hey,
you,
you,
and
you,
Everyone
else
get
on
the
bus,
okay?
You
guys,
you
go
knock
on
doors
The
bomb
is
gonna
go
off.
Get
out
by
You
do
two
blocks
and
you
get
back
Go,
go,
go!
Is
he
back?
Keep
your
eyes
open.
Go,
go.


BATMAN:
Where's
your
trigger?!
Where
is
it?!
You'd
never
give
it
Where
is
it?
Where's
your
trigger?

Where
is
it?!
Where
is
it?!
Tell
me
where
the
trigger
is.
Then
you
have
my
permission
to
die.
BANE:
How
have
you
come
back?
You
think
you're
the
only
one
who
could
Where's
the
trigger?
BANE:
But
the
child.
The
child
of
Ra's
Al
Ghul
made
the
climb.
MIRANDA:

I
am.
And
though
I'm
not
ordinary...
...I
am
a
citizen.
BATMAN:
Why?
Talia.
My
mother
named
me
Talia,
...the
way
I
would
have
been
killed,
...Bane.
Goodbye.
TALIA:
I
found
my
father...
...and
brought
him
back
But
by
that
time...
...the
prisoners
and
doctor
had
done
My
protector.
The
League
took
us
in.
Trained
us.
But
my
father
could
not
accept
Bane.
He
saw
only
a
monster.
His
very
existence
was
a
reminder
He
excommunicated
Bane
His
only
crime
was
that
he
loved
me.
I
could
not
forgive
my
father.
Until
you
murdered
him.

He
was
trying
to
kill
millions
Innocent
is
a
strong
word
I
honor
my
father
by
finishing
his
work.
Vengeance
against
the
man
who
killed
him
You
see...
...it's
the
slow
knife...
...the
knife
that
takes
its
time.
The
knife...
...that
waits
years
without
forgetting...
...then
slips
quietly
between
the
bones.
That's
the
knife...
...that
cuts
deepest.
Please.

Maybe
your
knife...
...was
too
slow.
MERCENARY:
Gordon.
No
matter.

He's
bought
Gotham
11
minutes.

Come
on!
This
way!
COP:
Blake,
MCU!
You'll
get
us
all
killed!
If
anyone
crosses
this
bridge,
It's
gonna
blow
anyway!
Detective,
if
you
take
one
step
forward
If
you
take
two
steps
forward,
Okay,
go
back
by
the
bus
and
wait
for
me,
TALIA:
Prepare
a
convoy.
We
must
secure
Don't
kill
him,
Feel
the
fire
of
12
million
souls
Goodbye,
my
friend.
BANE:
Keep
moving
forward!
Shoot
them.
Shoot
them
all.

BANE:
You'll
just
have
to
imagine
the
fire.

About
the
whole
no-guns
thing...
...I'm
not
sure
I
feel
as
strongly
Pull
up.
Stay
level.
We
have
to
force
that
convoy
east
I
need
you
on
the
ground,
The
situation
has
changed.
I'm
a
cop,
like

Please
do
not
shoot
me!
Shoot

feet.
Nothing
like
a
little

superiority.
Detective!
Please
stop!
Please,
detective!
Stop!
Stop
walking!
Blow
it!
Do
it!
You
have
to
get
that
bomb
here.
They're
pushing
us
They're
gonna
try
to
reconnect
the
core.
You
idiots!
You
sons
of
bitches!
You're
killing
us!
Yeah,
follow
your
orders!
All
right,
boys.
Get
in
a
circle.
It's
on
my
side.


BLAKE:

Back

On

FOX:
Stay
straight!

Give
me
a

Fox
showed
me
how
to
override
Oh,
dear.

Including
the
emergency
flood.
TALIA:
...this
bomb...
...will
be
stopped.
What
are
you
doing?
Protection
from
the
blast.
It's
an
atom
bomb!
Think
they
need
to

that?
Prepare
yourselves.
My
father's
work...

done.
GORDON:

CATWOMAN:
Set
it

BATMAN:
You
could've
gone
anywhere,
been
anything.
So
did
you.
I
guess
we're
both
suckers.
-
I
never
cared
who
you
were.
Shouldn't
the

know
A

can
be
anyone.
Even

No.

That's

You
