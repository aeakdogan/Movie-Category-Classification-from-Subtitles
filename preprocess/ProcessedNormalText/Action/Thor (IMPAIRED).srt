Wait
for
it.
-
Can
I
turn
on
the
radio?
ERIK:
Jane,
you
can't
keep
doing
this.
The
last
17
occurrences
ERIK:
Jane,
you're
an
astrophysicist,
JANE:
I'm
telling
you,
between
these
atmospheric
Erik,
I
wouldn't
have
asked
you
DARCY:
Jane?
I
think
you
want
to
see
this.
JANE:
What
is
that?
ERIK:
I
thought
you
said
Go!
-
Get
closer.
Go!


What
are
you
doing?
I
am
not
dying
for
six
college
credits!




DARCY:
I
think
JANE:
Get
the
first
aid
kit.
Do
me
a
favor
and
don't
be
dead.
Please.
Where
did
he
come
from?
ODIN:
Once,
mankind
accepted
a
simple
truth,
that
they
were
not
alone
Some
worlds
man
believed
Others,
they
knew
to
fear.
From
a
realm
of
cold
and
darkness

threatening
to
plunge
the
mortal
world

But
humanity

Our
armies
drove
the
Frost
Giants
The
cost
was
great.
In
the
end,
their
king
fell.
And
the
source
of
their
power
With
the
last
great
war
ended,
we
withdrew
from
the
other
worlds
to
the
Realm
Eternal,
Asgard.
Here
we
remain
as
a
beacon
of
hope,
shining
out
across
the
stars.
And
though
we
have
fallen
it
was
Asgard
and
its
warriors
that
brought
peace
to
the
universe.
But
the
day
will
come
when
one
of
you
will
have
to
defend
that
peace.
Do
the
Frost
Giants
still
live?
When
I'm
king,
I'll
hunt
the
monsters
down
Just
as
you
did,
Father.
A
wise
king
never
seeks
out
war.
But
he
must
always
be
ready
for
it.
-
I'm
ready,
Father.
Only
one
of
you
can
ascend
But
both
of
you
were
born
to
be
kings.

Oh,
please.

Thor
Odinson,
my
heir,
my
firstborn.
So
long
entrusted
with
forged
in
the
heart
of
a
dying
star,
its
power
has
no
equal,
as
a
weapon
to
destroy
or
as
a
tool
to
build.
'Tis
a
fit
companion
for
a
king.
I
have
defended
Asgard
and
the
lives
of
the
innocent
from
the
time
of
the
great
beginning.
Though
the
day
has
come...
Do
you
swear
to
guard
I
swear.
And
do
you
swear
I
swear.
Do
you
swear
to
cast
aside
all
selfish
ambition
and
to
pledge
yourself
only
I
swear!
Then,
on
this
day,
I,
Odin
All
father,
proclaim
you...
The
Frost
Giants!

THOR:
The
Jotuns
must
pay
They
have
paid,
with
their
lives.
The
Destroyer
did
its
work,
the
Casket
is
safe,
and
all
is
well.
All
is
well?
They
broke
into
the
weapons
vault!
If
the
Frost
Giants
had
stolen
-
They
didn't.
I
have
a
truce
with
Laufey,
He
just
broke
your
truce!
What
action
would
you
take?
March
into
Jotunheim
as
you
once
did.
Break
their
spirits
so
they'll
never
dare
You're
thinking
only
as
a
warrior.
This
was
an
act
of
war!
It
was
the
act
of
but
a
few,
Look
how
far
they
got!
We
will
find
the
breach
in
our
defenses
As
King
of
Asgard...
But
you're
not
king!
Not
yet.

It's
unwise
to
be
in
my
company
This
was
to
be
my
day
of
triumph.
It'll
come.
In
time.
What's
this?
If
it's
any
consolation,
About
the
Frost
Giants,
If
they
found
a
way
to
penetrate
who's
to
say
they
won't
try
again?
-
Next
time
with
an
army.
There's
nothing
you
can
do
No,
no,
no.
I
know
that
look.
That's
the
only
way
Thor,
it's
madness.
Madness?
What
sort
of
madness?
We're
going
to
Jotunheim.
VOLSTAGG:
What?
This
isn't
like
a
journey
to
Earth
where
you
summon
and
the
mortals
worship
you
as
a
god.
This
is
Jotunheim.
My
father
fought
his
way
into
Jotunheim,
defeated
their
armies
We
would
just
be
looking
for
answers.
It
is
forbidden!

My
friends,
have
you
forgotten
Fandral,
Hogun.
Who
led
you
You
did.
And
Volstagg,
you
thought
you'd
died

You
did.
Yes!
And
who
proved
wrong
that
a
young
maiden
could
be
this
realm
has
ever
known?
I
did.
True,
but
I
supported
you,
Sif.
My
friends,
we're
going
to
Jotunheim.
You
leave
this
to
me.
-
Good
Heimdall...
I'm
sorry?
Do
you
think
that
you
can
deceive
me?
-

You
must
be
mistaken...
Heimdall,
may
we
pass?
Never
has
an
enemy
slipped
my
watch
I
wish
to
know
how
that
happened.
Then
tell
no
one
where
we
have
gone
Understand?
What
happened?

HEIMDALL:
Be
warned.
I
will
honor
my
sworn
oath
If
your
return
Bifrost
will
remain
closed
to
you
and
you'll
be
left
to
die
VOLSTAGG:
Couldn't
you
just
HEIMDALL:
To
leave
the
bridge
open
would
unleash
and
destroy
Jotunheim
with
you
upon
it.
I
have
no
plans
to
die
today.
None
do.
We
shouldn't
be
here.
Let's
move.
Where
are
they?
Hiding,
as
cowards
always
do.
LAUFEY:
You've
come
a
long
way
to
die,
I
am
Thor
Odinson!
LAUFEY:
We
know
who
you
are.
How
did
your
people
get
into
Asgard?

The
House
of
Odin
is
full
of
traitors.
Do
not
dishonor
my
father's
name
Your
father
is
a
murderer
and
a
thief!
And
why
have
you
come
here?
You
long
for
battle.
You
crave
it.
You're
nothing
but
a
boy
trying
to
prove
himself
a
man.
THOR:
Well,
this
"boy"
Thor,
stop
and
think.
Look
around
you,
we're
outnumbered.
Know
your
place,
Brother.
You
know
not
I
do.
Go
now,
while
I
still
allow
it.
We
will
accept
your
most
gracious
offer.

Come
on.
Brother.
FROST
GIANT:
Damn.
Next?


At
least
make
it
a
challenge
for
me!

That's
more
like
it.

Don't
let
them
touch
you!

Thor!
-
We
must
go!
Run!
Thor!


Heimdall!
Open
the
bridge!


Father!
We'll
finish
them
together!
Silence!
All
father.
You
look
weary.
Laufey,
end
this
now.
Your
boy
sought
this
out.
You're
right.
And
these
are
the
actions
of
a
boy,
You
and
I
can
end
this
here
and
now,
We
are
beyond
diplomacy
now,
He'll
get
what
he
came
for.
War
and
death.
So
be
it.
THOR:
Why
did
you
bring
us
back?
ODIN:
Do
you
realize
what
you've
done?
-
What
you've
started?
You
cannot
even
protect
your
friends!
How
can
you
hope
Get
him
to
the
healing
room!
Now!
THOR:
There
won't
be
a
kingdom
The
Jotuns
must
learn
to
fear
me,
ODIN:
That's
pride
and
vanity
talking,
You've
forgotten
everything
I
taught
you
While
you
wait
and
be
patient,
The
old
ways
are
done.
You'd
stand
giving
speeches
You
are
a
vain,
greedy,
cruel
boy!
And
you
are
an
old
man
and
a
fool!
Yes.
I
was
a
fool
to
think
you
were
ready.
-
Father...
Thor
Odinson,
you
have
betrayed
Through
your
arrogance
and
stupidity,
you've
opened
these
peaceful
realms
to
the
horror
and
desolation
of
war!
You
are
unworthy
of
these
realms!
You're
unworthy
of
your
title!
You're
unworthy
of
the
loved
ones
you
have
betrayed.
I
now
take
from
you
your
power!
In
the
name
of
my
father
and
his
father
before,
I,
Odin
All
father,
cast
you
out!
Whosoever
holds
this
hammer,
shall
possess
the
power
of
Thor.

DARCY:
I
think
JANE:
Get
the
first
aid
kit.
Do
me
a
favor
and
don't
be
dead.

Whoa.
Does
he
need
CPR?

Where
did
he
come
from?
You
all
right?
Hammer?
Hammer?
Yeah,
we
can
tell
you're
hammered.

Oh,
my
God.
Erik,
look
at
this!
We
have
to
move
quickly
Jane,
we
have
to
take
him
-
Father!
Heimdall!
I
know
you
can
hear
me!
JANE:
Hospital.
You
go,
I'll
stay.
You.
What
realm
is
this?
Alfheim?
Nornheim?
New
Mexico?
You
dare
threaten
me,
Thor,


What?
He
was
freaking
me
out!
Next
time
make
sure
he's
already
in
the
car,
okay?
Jane!
Come
on.
NURSE:
Name?
He
said
it
was
Thor?
T-H-O-R.
-
And
your
relationship
to
him?
Until
she
hit
him
with
a
car.
I
grazed
him,
but
she
tasered
him.
Yes,
I
did.
Hi.
Just
taking
a
little
blood.
How
dare
you
attack
the
son
of
Odin?
MALE
NURSE:
I
need
some
help!
Call
security!
MAN:
Security
to
ER
3,
stat!
You're
no
match
for
the
Mighty...
Huh.
ERIK:
You
don't
think
Look,
the
lensing
around
these
edges
is
characteristic
A
what?
-
I
thought
you
were
a
science
major?
She
was
the
only
applicant.
An
Einstein-Rosen
Bridge
between
two
different
points
It's
a
wormhole.
-
Erik,
look.
What
do
you
see?
Yeah,
but
not
our
stars.
See,
this
is
the
star
alignment
and
unless
Ursa
Minor
decided
these
are
Hey!
Check
this
out.
No,
it
can't
be.
I
think
I
left
something
at
the
hospital.
It's
not
possible!

He
was
on
drugs
or
something.
DARCY:
Oh,
my
God.
I
just
lost
Typical.
-
So
now
what?
Did
you
see
what
he
did
in
there?
I'm
not
sure
finding
him
is
the
best
idea.
Well,
our
data
can't
tell
us
and
he
can.
So,
we're
gonna
find
him.
DARCY:
Okay.
So
we're
gonna
look
Exactly.
JANE:
What?
I'm
so
sorry.

I
got
it,
I
got
it.
MAN:
Come
on,
kick
it
in
now!


Did
it
work?

Sir,
we
found
it.
You
know,
for
a
crazy
homeless
person,
Hey,
sorry
I
tased
you!
Excuse
me,
excuse
me!
What
is
this?
Oh.
My
ex.
Good
with
patients
They're
the
only
clothes
I
had
They
will
suffice.
You're
welcome.
THOR:
I
need
sustenance.
We
should
never
have
let
him
go.
There
was
no
stopping
him.
FANDRAL:
Well,
at
least
Which
is
what
we'd
all
be
if
that
guard
hadn't
told
Odin
How
did
the
guard
even
know?
I
told
him.
What?
I
told
him
to
go
to
Odin
after
we'd
left.
He
should
be
flogged
for
taking
so
long.
We
should
never
have
You
told
the
guard?
I
saved
our
lives.
And
Thor's.
I
had
no
idea
Father
would
banish
him
Loki.
You
must
go
to
the
All
father
And
if
I
do,
then
what?
I
love
Thor
more
dearly
than
any
of
you,
He's
arrogant.
You
saw
how
he
was
today.
Is
that
what
Asgard
needs
from
its
king?
He
may
speak
of
the
good
of
Asgard,
We
should
be
grateful
to
him,
Laufey
said
there
were
traitors
in
the
House
of
Odin.
A
master
of
magic
FANDRAL:
but
you're
talking
ODIN:
Stop!
LOKI:
Am
I
cursed?
ODIN:
No.
What
am
I?
You're
my
son.
What
more
than
that?
The
Casket
wasn't
the
only
thing
was
it?
No.
In
the
aftermath
of
the
battle,
I
went
into
the
temple

Small
for
a
giant's
offspring.
Abandoned,
suffering,
left
to
die.
Laufey's
son.
Laufey's
son.
Yes.
Why?
You
were
knee-deep
in
Jotun
blood,
You
were
an
innocent
child.
No.
You
took
me
for
a
purpose.

Tell
me!
I
thought
Bring
about
an
alliance,
Through
you.
What?
But
those
plans
no
longer
matter.
So
I
am
no
more
locked
up
here
Why
do
you
twist
my
words?
You
could
have
told
me
what
I
was
why
didn't
you?
You're
my
son.
I
wanted
only
to
protect
you
Because
I'm
the
monster
parents
tell
their
children
about
-
No,
no.
Why
you
favored
Thor
all
these
years!
Because
no
matter
how
much
you
could
never
have
a
Frost
Giant
Guards!
Guards,
please,
help!
JANE:
How'd
you
get
inside
that
cloud?
DARCY:
Also,
how
could
you
eat
and
still
be
this
hungry?
-
This
drink,
I
like
it.
Another!
JANE:
Sorry,
Izzy.
Little
accident.
-
What
was
that?
-
Well,
you
could
have
just
said
so.
-
No,
I
mean,
ask
nicely.
All
right.
Well,
no
more
smashing.
Deal?
You
have
my
word.
Good.
MAN
1:
The
usual,
please,
Izzy.
MAN
2:
You
missed
all
the
excitement
MAN
1:
They're
saying
some
kind
MAN
2:
Yeah,
we
were
having
until
the
Feds
showed
up.
JANE:
Excuse
me.
MAN
2:
Yeah.
Oh,
my
God.
This
is
going
on
Facebook.
What
did
it
look
like,
the
satellite?
I
don't
know
anything
about
satellites,
I
mean,
nobody
could
lift
it.
They
said
it
was
radioactive.
Which
way?
Fifty
miles
west
of
here.
MAN
1:
Well,
I
wouldn't
waste
my
time!
Looked
like
the
whole
Army
-

DRIVER:
Dumbass!
Where
are
you
going?
-
Fifty
miles
west
of
here.
-
To
get
what
belongs
to
me.
It's
not
what
they
say
it
is.
Well,
whatever
it
is,
the
government
seems
to
think
So,
you
just
intend
to
go
in
there
Yes.
If
you
take
me
there
now,
I'll
tell
you
everything
you
wish
to
know.
-
Everything?
All
the
answers
you
seek
will
be
yours
Myeu-muh?
What's
Myeu-muh?
Can
I
have
a
word,
Jane?
Please
don't
do
this.

This
is
no
coincidence.
But
I'm
not
talking
about
the
crater,
-
But
he's
promising
us
the
answers.
Listen
to
what
he's
saying.
He's
talking
about
Mjolnir
It's
the
stories
I
grew
up
with
as
a
child.
I'm
just
going
to
drive
him.
That's
it.
He's
dangerous,
Jane.
I'm
sorry,
but
I
can't
take
you.
Then
this
is
where
we
say
goodbye.

Um...
Thank
you?
Jane
Foster,
Erik
Selvig,
Darcy,
farewell.
All
right.
Back
to
work.

Hey!
That's
my
stuff!
What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
Ms.
Foster,
Is
that
supposed
to
mean
something
-
You
can't
do
this!
Jane,
this
is
a
lot
more
serious
Let
it
go?
This
is
my
life.
We're
investigating
a
security
threat.
We
need
to
appropriate
your
records
By
"appropriate,"
do
you
mean
steal?
Here,
this
should
for
your
trouble.
I
can't
just
buy
replacements
I
made
most
of
this
equipment
myself!
Then
I'm
sure
you
can
do
it
again.
And
I'm
sure
I
can
sue
you
I'm
sorry,
Ms.
Foster,
So
are
we!
I'm
on
the
verge
of
understanding
And
everything
I
know
is
either
in
this
lab
or
in
this
book.
And
you
can't
just
take
this
away...
Hey!
Jane!
Easy!
Easy.
Jane...
Thank
you
for
your
cooperation.
Years
of
research,
gone.
DARCY:
They
even
took
my
iPod.
ERIK:
What
about
the
backups?
They
took
the
backups
of
our
backups.
I
just
downloaded,
like,
Could
you
please
stop
with
your
iPod?
Who
are
these
people?
I
knew
this
scientist.
The
pioneer
in
gamma
radiation.
S.H.I.E.L.D.
showed
up
and
he
wasn't
heard
from
again.
They're
not
gonna
do
that
to
us.
Come
on,
please.
He's
had
some
dealings
I'll
e-mail
him
and
maybe
he
can
help.
They
took
your
laptop,
too.
All
father,
My
friends.
Where's
Odin?
Father
has
fallen
into
the
Odin
sleep.
Mother
fears
We
would
speak
with
her.
She
has
refused
to
leave
You
can
bring
your
urgent
matter
to
me.

Your
king.
My
King,
we
would
ask

My
first
command
We're
on
the
brink
of
war
Our
people
need
a
sense
of
continuity,
in
order
to
feel
safe
All
of
us
must

together

the
good

Yes,
of
course.

Good.
Then
you
will
wait
for
my
word.
beg
the
indulgence
of
Your
Majesty
We're
done!

I
need
a
horse!
We
don't
have
horses.
Then
give
me
one
of
those
-

I've
never
done
anything
like
this
before.
Have
you
ever
done
Many
times.
But
you're
brave
to
do
it.
Well,
they
just
stole
I
don't
really
have
much
left
to
lose.
Yeah,
but
you're
clever.
Far
more
clever
than
anyone
else
"Realm"?
"Realm"?
-
You
think
me
strange.
Good
strange
or
bad
strange?
I'm
not
quite
sure
yet.


I'm
sorry.
But
who
are
you?
Really?
You'll
see
soon
enough.
You
promised
me
answers.
What
you
seek,
it's
a
bridge.
Like
an
Einstein-Rosen
Bridge?
More
like
a
Rainbow
Bridge.
God,
I
hope
you're
not
crazy.
LOKI:

FRIGGA:
He's
put
it
off
for
so
long
now,
How
long
will
it
last?
I
don't
know.
This
time
it's
different.
So
why
did
he
lie?
He
kept
the
truth
from
you
You
are
our
son,
Loki,
and
we,
your
family.
We
mustn't
lose
hope
And
your
brother.
What
hope
is
there
for
Thor?
There's
always
a
purpose

JANE:
That's
no
satellite
crash!
They
would
have
hauled
they
wouldn't
have
built
a

around
it.

You're
going
to
need
this.

Now
stay
here.
Once
I
have
Mjolnir,
I
will
return
Deal?
No.
Look
what's
down
there.
You
think
you're
just
gonna
walk
in,
No.
I'm
going
to
fly
out.

Sir,

You've
reached
Dr.

Hi,
Erik,
it's
me.
Don't
worry,
I'm
fine,
but
just
in
case
just
come
by
the
crater

I
did
exactly
what
you
told
me
not
to.
So
sorry.
Bye.
AGENT

Bravo

move!


AGENT

Entering

AGENT

Negative,
negative.
AGENT4:
Target
sighted,
east

I
need
eyes
up
high,
with
a

Moving
north!
What
have
we
got?
There's
a
massive
coming
off
that
thing.
Systems
are
barely
coping.
Barton?
Talk
to
me.
You
want
me
to
slow
him
down,
sir?
Or
are
you
sending
in
more
guys
I'll
let
you
know.
You're
big.
Fought
bigger.
Better
call
it,
Coulson,
Last
chance,
sir.
COULSON:
Wait.
I
want
to
see
this.


All
right,
show's
over.
ERIK:
He
committed
a
crime.
He's
in
jail!
JANE:
I
can't
just
leave
him
there!
You
didn't
see
what
I
saw!
DARCY:

Look!
Where'd
you
find
this?
ERIK:
The
children's
section.
I
just
wanted
to
show
you
But
you're
the
one
to
chase
down
every
possibility,
I'm
talking
about
science,
not
magic!
Well,
magic's
just
science

A
precursor
to

fact!
Well,
if
there
is
then
there's
something
And
advanced

Jane.
A
primitive
culture
like
the
Vikings
Yes!
Yes,
exactly.
Thank
you.
Mmm-hmm.

COULSON:
You
made
my
men,
some
of
the
most
look
like
a
bunch
of
minimum-wage
That's
hurtful.
In
my
experience,
it
takes
someone
to
do
what
you
did
to
them.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
Pakistan?
Chechnya?
Afghanistan?
No,
you
strike
me
Where
was
it?
South
Africa?
Certain
groups
pay
very
well
Who
are
you?
One
way
or
another,
We're
good
at
that.

Don't
go
anywhere.
Loki!
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
had
to
see
you.
What's
happened?
Tell
me.
Is
it
Jotunheim?
Let
me
explain
to
Father.
Father
is
dead.
What?
Your
banishment,
the
threat
of
a
new
war,
it
was
too
much
for
him
to
bear.
You
mustn't
blame
yourself.
I
know
that
you
loved
him.
I
tried
to
tell
him
so,
It
was
so
cruel
knowing
that
you
could
never
lift
it.
The
burden
of
the
throne
Can
I
come
home?
The
truce
with
Jotunheim
-
Yes,
but
couldn't
we
find
a
way...
This
is
goodbye,
Brother.
I'm
so
sorry.
No.
I
am
sorry.
Thank
you
for
coming
here.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
Goodbye?
I
just
got
back.


Sir?
He's
got
a
visitor.
His
name
is
Donald
Blake?
Dr.
Donald
Blake.
You
have
dangerous
coworkers,
He
was
distraught
when
he
found
out
That
was
years
of
his
life,
gone!
You
can
understand
A
big,
faceless
organization
like
yours
coming
in
with
their
That's
how
he
put
it.
That
still
doesn't
explain
how
he
managed
Steroids!
He's
a
bit
of
a
fitness
nut.

TECHNICIAN:
Sir?
It
says
here
that
he's
an
M.D.
Well,
he
is!
Or
he
was.
He
switched
careers
A
brilliant
physicist.
He's
a
wonderful
man.
ERIK:
Oh,
Donny,
Donny,
Donny!
There
you
are.
You're
gonna
be
all
right.
COULSON:
Dr.
Selvig!
Just
keep
him
away
from
the
bars.
I
will!
-
Where
are
we
going?
Follow
them.
You
know,
I
had
it
all
backwards.
I
had
it
all
wrong.
It's
not
a
bad
thing
finding
out
You
start
asking
the
right
questions.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
have
no
idea
what
I'm
supposed
to
do.
Anyone
who's
ever
going
to
has
to
start
by
admitting
Thank
you
for
what
you've
done.
No,
don't
thank
me.
I
only
did
it
for
Jane.
Her
father
and
I
He
was
a
good
man.
He
never
listened.
Neither
did
I.
My
father
but
I
was
too
stupid
to
see
it.
I
don't
know
if
you're
delusional
I
don't
care.
I
just
care
about
her.
I've
seen
the
way
she
looks
at
you.
I
swear
to
you,
I
mean
her
no
harm.
Good.
In
that
case,
I'll
buy
you
another
round,
Two
boilermakers.
LAUFEY:
Kill
him.
After
all
I've
done
for
you?
So
you're
the
one
That
was
just
a
bit
of
fun,
really.
To
ruin
my
brother's
big
day.
And
to
protect
the
realm
I
will
hear
you.
I
will
conceal
you
lead
you
into
Odin's
chambers,
Why
not
kill
him
yourself?

I
suspect
that
the
Asgardians
to
a
king
who
had
murdered
Once
Odin
is
dead,
and
you
can
return
Jotunheim
to
all
its...
Glory.
I...
Accept.
What
troubles
you,
Gatekeeper?
I
turned
my
gaze
upon
you
in
Jotunheim,
You
were
shrouded
from
me,
like
the
Frost
Giants
Perhaps
your
senses
have
weakened
Or
perhaps
someone
has
found
a
way
to
hide
that
You
have
great
power,
Heimdall.
Did
Odin
ever
fear
you?
-
No.
Because
he
is
my
king
He
was
your
king
Yes?
Yes.
Then
you
will
open
the
Bifrost
to
no
one
until
I
have
repaired
the
damage


Oh,
my
God.
Is
he
okay?
He's
fine.
Not
injured
at
all.
-

-
What
happened?
he
made
his
ancestors
proud.
Put
him
on
the
bed.


I
still
don't
think
But
you
ought
to
be.
Are
these
your
chambers?
It's
more
of
a
temporary
living
situation.
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
usually
have
guests.
Actually,
I
never
have
guests.
That's
not
the
right
place
for
it.
I'm
sorry.
Can
we
go
outside?
Yes,
of
course.
I
come
up
here
sometimes
or
I'm
trying
to
reconcile
particle
data,
I
come
up
here
a
lot,
actually,
I'm
really
glad
you're
safe.
You've
been
very
kind
to
me,
and
I've
been
far
less
grateful
Well,
I
hit
you
with
my
car
so
I
think
that
kind
of
evens
things
out.
Perhaps
I
had
it
coming.
Oh,
my
God!
I
don't
believe
it!
It
was
all
I
could
get
back.
No,
no,
this
is
great!
This
is...
Thank
you.
What's
wrong?
S.H.I.E.L.D.
Whatever
they
are,
they're
gonna
do
to
make
sure
this
research
No,
Jane.
Listen
to
me.
You
must
not
give
up.
-
You
must
finish
what
you've
started.
Because
you're
right.
Here,
look.
Your
ancestors
called
it
magic,
Well,
I
come
from
a
place
What
is
that?
My
father
explained
it
to
me
like
this,
that
your
world
is
one
of
the
Nine
Realms
linked
to
each
other
the
Worlds
Tree.
Now
you
see
it
every
day
The
images
glimpsed
through...
This
Hooble
Telescope.
-
Hubble.

Tell
me
more.
So,
the
Nine
Realms.
Now,
there
is
Midgard,
which
is
Earth.
This
is
Alfheim.
Vanaheim.
Jotunheim.
And
Asgard.
And
that's
where
I
come
from.
Thank
you,
Jane.
FANDRAL:
Our
dearest
friend
banished,
Asgard
on
the
brink
of
war,
four
wild
boar,
and
two
casks
of
ale.
Shame
on
you.
Do
not
mistake
my
appetite
for
apathy!
Stop
it,
both
of
you!
Stop.
-
We
all
know
what
we
have
to
do.
We
must
find
Thor.
It's
treason.
To
hell
with
treason,
it's
suicide.
Thor
would
do
the
same
for
us.
Now
shush.
Heimdall
might
be
watching.

Heimdall
demands
your
presence.
VOLSTAGG:
We're
doomed.
You
would
defy
the
commands
of
Loki,
break
every
oath
you
and
commit
treason
to
bring
Thor
back?
-
Yes.
So
you'll
help
us?
I
am
bound
by
honor
to
our
king.
Complicated
fellow,
isn't
he?
Now
what
do
we
do?
Look!
-
What
the
hell
was
that?
We
got
massive
energy
readings
and
then
they
just
disappeared.
Let's
go
take
a
look.
Thank
you.

Thank
you.

I
don't

Oh,
excuse
me.
My

I've
never
been

But

We're

You

And

But
I
have
need

And
I
say,
for
your
act
of
treason,
you
are
relieved
of
your

and

Then
I
need

obey

No.
I

Now
go.

Do
not

I

Come

Come

Wait!

doing?
Brother,
whatever
I
have
done
I
am
truly
sorry.
But
these

are
innocent.

nothing.
So
take
mine

end

No.

It's

No.

We're

No.

you!
Welcome
to

Heimdall,
open
the

Heimdall?
Heimdall!
He
doesn't

Then
we
are

Heimdall!

Heimdall!

Why,

must
have
been

You're

talented

It's
good
to
have
you
back.

you'll
excuse

LOKI:
You
can't
stop
it.
The

Why
have
you
done
this?
To
prove
to
Father
When
he
wakes,
I
will
have
destroyed
that
And
I
will
be
true
heir
to
the
throne!
You
can't
kill
an
entire
race!
Why
not?
And
what
is
this
newfound
love
You
could
have
killed
them
all
-
I've
changed.
Now
fight
me.
I
never
wanted
the
throne!
I
only
ever
wanted
to
be
your
equal.
I
will
not
fight
you,
Brother!
I'm
not
your
brother.
I
never
was.
Loki,
this
is
madness.
Is
it
madness?
Is
it?
Is
it?
Come
on.
What
happened
to
you
Don't
tell
me
it
was
that
woman.
Oh!
It
was!
Well,
maybe,
when
we're
finished
here,


Thor!
Brother,
please.

Enough!


Look
at
you,
the
Mighty
Thor,
with
all
your
strength,
and
what
good
does
it
do
you
now,
huh?
Do
you
hear
me,
Brother?
What
are
you
doing?
If
you
destroy
the
bridge,
Forgive
me,
Jane.

I
could
have
done
it,
Father!
I
could
have
done
it!
For
you!
For
all
of
us!
No,
Loki.
Loki,
no.
No!
No.
JANE:
It's
gone.

And
then,
with
a
mighty
bellow,
I
flew
into

He

Someday,
perhaps,
I
shall
make
you
proud.
You've
already
made
me
proud.
So
Earth
is
lost
to
us.

There
is

see
her?

Yes.
ERIK:
I
have
the
particle
detectors!
Darcy,
do
you
have
the
S.H.I.E.L.D.
DARCY:
Yeah.
Have
you
seen
my
taser?
THOR:
How
is
she?
ERIK:
In
the
car.

on,
Jane!
HEIMDALL:
She
searches
for
you.
NICK
FURY:
Dr.
Selvig.
So
you're
the
man
behind
all

I

it?

tells
us
one

But
every
now
and

Power,
Doctor.
If
we
can
figure
out
how
to
tap
it,
maybe
unlimited
power.
Well,
I
guess
that's
worth
a
look.
Well,
I

that's
