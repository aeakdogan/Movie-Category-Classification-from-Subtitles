cIawing

Because
when

It
didn't
take
for

to

...that
these

You

I

CELESTE:
Danny

I

WITWER:
TeII
me
what
you
have.
This
is
the
murder
of
a
woman
John
toId
me
about
this.
Yes.
This
is
from
the
twins,
Agatha's
stream
was
missing.
This
one
is
from
the
Cyber
ParIor.
Anderton
downIoaded
this
directIy
-It's
the

Look
at

He
toId
me
about

was
concerned
you
might
find

It
was

So
the
question
is,
why
wouId
someone
Danny,
just
teII
me
I'm
thinking
someone
How?
Jad
toId
me
that
sometimes
the
Pre-Cogs

We
teach
the

Yeah,
but
what
if
a

onIy
What
if
he
was
Iooking
at
a
compIeteIy
I
don't
understand.
AII
you'd
have
to
do
is
hire
someone
...Iike
a
drifter,
a
neuroin
addict,
Precrime
stops
the
murder
...haIoes
the
kiIIer,
takes
him
away.
...having
reviewed
the
prevision
...commits
the
murder
Technician
takes
a

thinks
he's
It'd
have
to
be
someone
with

-Someone
fairIy
high-up.
Do
you
know
what
I
hear?
Nothing.
No
hovercraft
out
the
window.
Do
you
know
why?
Because
right
now,

AGATHA:
-Where
are
we

-Burgess.
BURGESS:
Yes,
Lara.
-Is
he
there?
Is
the

ANDERTON:
They
wanted
me
to
think
But
he
didn't.
He
didn't.
Why
wouId
they
set
you
up?
Because
I
found
out
about
her.
About

Hello,

I

You

Everyone

All
you

A-room.
Jad.
Jad,
it's
Lara.
John

-What
are
you
taIking
about?
Just
a

had
a

once
She
cleaned
herself
up,
She
wanted
Agatha.
Jad,

this?
It's

KNOTT:
ANDERTON:
You

How
can
you
kill
her
Simple.
Use
a

You
hired
someone
to
kill
her,
knowing
You
lured
Anne
Lively

with
the
promise
of
reuniting
her
Where's
my
daughter?
Where?
Run!
Run!

ANDERTON:
When
you
were
all
alone,
...in
the
same
way
the
Pre-Cogs
You
made
the
real
murder
...knowing
the
tech
would
do
what
Anne
Lively
became
So,
what
are
you
gonna
do,
Lamar?
What
are
you
gonna
do?

We
got
a
Red
BaII!
Think
about
the

Think
about

Think
of

You

now,
Lamar?
-How
are
you
gonna--?
Forgive
me,
John.
Forgive
me,
John.
ANDERTON:
It's
over.
The
question
you
have
to
ask
is,
No
doubt
the
Pre-Cogs
have
No
doubt.
You
see
the
diIemma,
don't
you?
If
you
don't
kiII
me,
Pre-Cogs
were
If
you
do
kiII
me,
you
go
away...
...but
it
proves
the
system
works.
So,
what
are
you
gonna
do
now?
What's
it
worth?
Just
one
more
murder.
You'II
rot
in
heII
with
a
haIo,
but
AII
you
have
to
do
is
kiII
me,
Except...
...you
know
your
own
future...
...which
means
you
can
change
it
You
stiII
have
a
choice,
Lamar.
Like
I
did.
Yes,
I
have
a
choice...
...and
I
made
