Mr.
Jacobs,
Mr.
Jacobs
I
am
begging
you,
I
am
begging
you,
not
to
do
this.
Look,
it
costs
a
small
fortune
to
run
lab
workups
on
all
of
those
chimps
only
to
tell
me
what
I
already
know,
that
they
are
contaminated.
There
are
lives
at
stake
here.
These,
these
are
animals
with
attachments.
Attachments?

there
must
be

Yes.
There
is,
I
could
fire
you.
Believe
me,
we
talked
about
it.
We
have

Franklin!
It's
very
small.
She
must
have
been
pregnant
when
we
brought
her
in.
So
that's
why

She
wasn't
being
aggressive.
She
thought

I
would
take

myself,
but
my

What,
you
want
me
to
take
it

I
can't
take
care
of
a
monkey.
He's
not
a
monkey!
He's
an
ape.
You
know,
it's
just
for
a
couple
days
until
I
find
a
sanctuary.

That's
all
I
need.
Franklin,
no!
Look,
this
isn't
my
responsibility.
This,
this
is
company
property.
Okay
...
I
tell
you
what,
Doc.
Jacobs
made
me
put
down
the
other
12.
I'm
done.
Be
my
guest.
Hey!
You
look
beat.
Well,
he
has
good
days
and
bad
days.
Today,
not
so
good,
although
he
has
been
quoting
Shakespeare.
Oh,
you
got
a
pet?
Uh,
it's
just
a
temporary
house
guest.
Well,
maybe
that'll
be
good
for
him.
Good
night!

Hi,
Dad!
Dad?
Will!
I
didn't
hear
Today's
the
day,
right?
You
thought
I'd
forget?
You
have
a
big
test
today,
right?
Chemistry?
Hey,
Dad
...
You
want
to
see
something?
What
is
that?
Is
he
injured?
No,
I
think
that's
a
birthmark.
"As
for
Caesar,
kneel
down,
Yeah,
don't
get
too
attached.
He's
a
cute
little
guy,
isn't
he?
Where's
my
car

My
car
keys,
where'd
you
put
'em?
Dad,
...
you
a,
you
don't
drive
anymore.
I
know
that.
Here
...
Why
don't
you
feed
him.
Of
course,
I
can..
Will!
...
Look
at
this!
How
old
is
he?
Yeah
...
He's
a
smart
one,
isn't
he?
What
are
you
going
to
name
him?
I
do
not
know

he

Dad!
I'm
sorry.
He

in
a

This
is
no

for
him
to
live.
No
way
to
live?
I
broke
my
lamp
...
It'll
make
you
better,
Dad.

Dad!
Dad!

Todd,
come
inside
for
breakfast.
I'll
need
to
keep
track
of

I
don't
see

Something

I'll
need
a

Now,

Will!

I'm
not
sick,
anymore!
It
was
nothing,
Dad.
Ceasar.

Where's
Caesar?
Caesar!
Caesar!
He
can't
have
gone
far.
Caesar!
Daddy!
Caesar!
Get
out
of
here!
Get
out!
Get
out!
Hey,
hey,
hey
...
It
doesn't
matter
what
you
do.
If
I
catch
that
animal
anywhere
He's
not
dangerous.
It
won't
happen
again.
Damn
right,
it
won't!
Come
on,
Dad.
Stay
in
the
house!
I
told
you
not
to
go
out
without
us.
It's
okay
...
How
bad
is
it?
I
do
not
know.
He
likes
you.
Don't
worry.
It'll
be
over
soon.
Then,
we
can
go
get
a
treat.
I'm
thinking,
ice
cream.
Good
idea!
You
taught
him
to
sign?
Just,
handful
of
things,
basic
stuff.
What's
he
saying?
Nothing.
So,
when
do
you
think
we
should
come
back?
Well,
you
won't
need
to
come
back.
because,
um,
I
would
just
say,
watch
for
Fever
...
redness
...
Okay,
what's
he
saying,
now?
Um,
well,
...
he
thinks
that
you
and
I
should

I
...
know
...
Caesar!
Come
on!
Good
to
see
you,
again,
Caroline.
You
coming,
Caesar?
So,
what's
your
secret?
Oh,
I
can't
take
any
credit.
I
think
you're
being
very
modest.
He's
pretty
amazing.
I
think
you've
built
a
pretty
good
You
know
he
won't
stay
this
way
for
long.
He's
going
to
soon
grow
into
a
large,
powerful,
animal.
Come
here!
How's
he
been
doing?
Okay,
I
think.
I
love
chimpanzees.
I'm
also
afraid
of
them.
And,
it's
appropriate
to
Caesar
will
never
hurt
anyone.
He's
happy
here.
Yeah,
I
see
that.
We
can
at
least
give
him
some
open
space?
-
Yeah.
That
would
prpbably
be
a
good
idea.
I
know
a
place
right
across
the
bridge,
the
Redwoods.

It's
a
paradise.
Come
on!
Come
here.
Doesn't
need
a
leash!
Just
to
be
safe.
It's
the
redwoods.
Caesar!
All
right.
If
I
take
this
off
you
can
I'll
never
find
you
again.
Okay.
What's
this?
I
don't
believe
that!
He's
asking
your
permission.
It's
a
supplicating
gesture.
It's
okay.
Come
on,
Caesar!
Look
at
him
go!
Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!!
Caesar!
There
you
are
...
Caesar!
Come
on,
Caesar,
climb!
Go
higher!
Climb!
Be
careful!
Caesar,
be
careful!
FIVE
YEARS
LATER
Hi!
What's
going
on,
buddy?
Give
some
love.
Come
on,
honey.
Is
that
a
chimpanzee?

Come
on!
Come
on!


Caesar!
...
Caesar!
Come
on!
It's
all
right.
Come
on.
Come
on!
Let's
go.
Are
you
getting
in?
Caesar
...
You
okay,
pal?
Are
you
pet?
...
No.
You're
not
a
pet.
I
am
your
father.
What
is
Caesar?
Okay
...
Caesar,
this
is
where
I
work.
This
is
were
you
were
born.
Your
mother
was
here
But
she's
not
here,
anymore
...
so
...
...
that's
why
I
took
home
Yeah.
Your
mother's
dead.
The
thing
is,
she
was
given
medicine,
like
the
medicine
I
give
to
Charles.
She
passed
it
on
to
you.
That's
why
you're
so
smart.
Let's
take
him
home.
Come
on,
explain
it
to
me.
All
right.
I
snuck
him
out
of
the
lab
I
had
no
idea
that
the
effects
had
But,
since
then,
he's
been
displaying
I

112
to
repair,
Here's
his
IQ
from
last
year.
Since
then,
it's
doubled.
This
is
all
wrong.
My
father
was
on
gone
You
never
saw
how
bad
he
was.
He
has
his
life
again.
And,
what
about
Caesar?
How
does
he
fit
in?
With
me,
...
with
us
...
Listen,
...
I
know
it
has
been
hard
for
you,
but
you
are
trying
to
control
things
The
112
works.
Do
you
realize
how
you
sound?
All
I'm
saying
is
Caesar's
proof
of
that.
So's
my
father.
Caesar,
eat
your
food.
Dad,
are
you
okay?
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
Antibodies.
His
system
has
found
a
way
so
that
it
can't
deliver
My
father's
disease
is
going
Stop!
Stop,
right
now!
Hey!
Get
out
there!
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
I
said,
get
out
of
my
car!
I'm
a
pilot!
I've
got
to
get
How
am
I
gonna
get
there
now,
huh?
Answer
the
God-damn
question!
I
have
a
car
just
exactly
...
I'm
done
...
Stay
right
there!
You
will
pay!
This
is
your
problem,
...
not
through
with
you!
Caesar,
stop!
Daddy!
Caesar!
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
He
didn't
mean
it.
It's
okay
...
Hey,
hey,
take
that
thing
off
of
him!
Take
that
thing
off
of
him!
Look,
I'll
take
him
in,
okay?
No,
he's
under
court
orders.
It's
fine!
Let
him.
Bring
him
in
when
you're
ready.
Take
it
off.
Thank
you!
Caesar,
Caesar,
Caesar,
Not
right
now.
Let's
just
see
what
it's
like
Come
on,
Caesar.
Let's
go.
Come
on,
...
trust
me.
It's
okay.
Go.
He
hasn't
spent
any
time
with
other
chimps.
Oh,
we're
used
to
that.
He'll
be
a
little
skittish
at
first,
You'd
be
surprised
We
provide
a
stimulating
environment.
He's
going
to
thrive
here.
Come,
let's
do
some
paperwork.
Make
sure
you
lock
that
door
Caesar!
You'll
be
okay!
Everything's
going
to
be
okay!
Don't
be
scared.
You're
going
to
stay
here,
now.
No
...
Not
going
home
right
now.
It's
OK.
The
longer
you
drag
out
the
good-byes,
the
harder
it
is.
Can
I
sign
that
later?
You'll
probably
miss
him
more
than
You'd
best
give
him
a
couple
of
weeks
Will,
we
have
to
go.
We
have
to
go
home.
Coming
back
soon,
okay?
Just
call
ahead,
before
you
do.
Hey,
over
here!
Hey,
I
can
get
you
out!
Come
on!

Over
here!
Hey,
down
here.
Stupid
monkey
...
So
you?
Come
on,
make
it!
Court

Once
it

You'll

Here's
what's
going

and
you're

to

we
have

Because,
I'm

Be

You're

to

My

the

his
health
is
deteriorating,
I
need
a
more
aggressive

strain,
a
faster

because
at
this
rate
...
I
can't
lose
them
both.
I
won't
lose
them
both.
Hi
....
Can
we
talk?
Make
it
fast.

I've
got
a
meeting.
The
ten
years
you
have
been
how
many
drugs
have
come
down
the
pipeline
That
could
change
everything?
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
ALZ-112.
What
happened
to
you,
Will?
You
used
to
be
the
star
of
this
lab.
and
when
you
do,
you
waste
your
time
fixating
on
a
drug
that,
after
what
happened,
The
112
is
dangerous,
Will,
and
it
doesn't
work.
I
treated
my
father
with
it.
It
does
work.
You
did,
what?
You
did,
what!?
Beat
the
disease,
like
we
predicted.
Brilliant.
There's
been
a
complication.
Well,
does
it
work
or
doesn't
it?
My
father's
disease
eventually
Oh,
for
goodness
sake.
The
immune
system
produced
antibodies
but
it
will
work.
I've
have
already
developed
a
virus
strain
that
I
think
will
be
more
aggressive.
You
think?
Just,
let
me
test
it.
You're
wasting
my
time.
There's
more!
The
applications
go
beyond
the
disease.
There
are
indications
that
show
the
memory
quality
...
What,
what
are
you
saying?
My
father
didn't
just
recover.
He
improved.
You
mean,
increased
intelligence?
It's
not
conclusive,
but
yes.
I
want
you,
to
start
testing
the
Okay.
I'll
give
you
whatever
you
need,
Dinner
time!
Great
Ape,
primate!
Go
on,
don't
you
know
food
You
think
that's
funny,
huh?
I
show
you
something
funny!
You'll
learn
who's
boss,
soon
enough.
What
about
his
clothes?
What
about
'em?
I
don't
know
...
May
cause
problems
Good!
I
counted
ten
apes,
correct?
Yep.
Good.

All
the
way
to
the
back.
You
guys
are
moving
really
quick
on
this.
First
day
back,
Koba.
Hi,
I'm
Will.
This
one.
He's
very
calm.
Yeah.
He's
been
through
a
whole
lot
of
labs.
Could
I
join
you,
Get
him
prepped.
Tighten
your
masks.
Pass
me
the

We
have
a

Franklin,
get
your

Got
it?
Yeah.
You
okay?
Yeah,
okay.
Move
it!

Let's
go!
Get
up
and

are
remarkable.
There
are

All
right,

Okay.

Sorry
about
that.
