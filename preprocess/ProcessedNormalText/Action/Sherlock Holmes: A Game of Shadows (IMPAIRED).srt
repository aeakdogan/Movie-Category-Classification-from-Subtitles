How
about

-Splendid.
And
will
you
be
coming

Most
likely.
Three

No.
Oh,

Yes,

Hello,

Is
that

I

a
game,
dear
man,
a
shadowy
game.
We're
playing
cat

I
thought
it
was

I'm
not
a

I'm
a

Not
a

but
a

You're

Ooh.
Yes.
Care

You

-Excited?
-I
am.
-Ecstatic?

And
how
will
he
do
all
this?
Don't
be

No

the

No?

Definitive.
He'll

I

you'll
take
this
into
consideration.
MORIARTY:
And
what
considerations
Have
you
actually
read
the
book?
I
found
it
compelling...
...though
I'm
primarily
interested
I
take
that
as
a
compliment.
I
have
the
utmost
regard
for
your
talents.
It's
a
pleasure
to
finally
meet
you...
...officially.
HOLMES:
Are
you
familiar
with
the
study
I've
never
given
it
The
psychological
analysis
The
upward
strokes

if

suggestion

acute

inclination

insanity.
In
answer
to
your
previous
request

answer
is
no.

A

too
much
for
her,

She
succumbed

of
seconds.
Now...

you

afraid
you'd
lose.
Rest
assured,

attempt

shall
do
the

to
you.
My
respect
for
you,
Mr.

You've
paid
me
several
compliments.
Let
me
pay
you
one
in

I
say
that

would

accept
the
latter.
I'll

to

John,

rather
be
with.
Why
do
you
have
a

stuffed
down
Heh.
Old
habits.
Ahem.
Come
in.
-Oh,
yes,
please.
With
our
compliments,
sir.
Thank
you.
Put
it
there.
Open
the
door,
John.
I
think
it's
time
for
you
to
leave.
Sit
down.
Shh.
I
agree
it's
not
my
best
disguise,
-My
God.
-John,
shut
the
door.
HOLMES:
He's
right,
you
know.
-I
understand.
Terribly
inconvenient.
We
don't
have
much
time.
-How
many
are
we
expecting?
WATSON:
Who
are
they?
Lovely
ceremony,
by
the
way.
MARY:
Yeah,

Well,

to
be
done.
She's

now.
In
my
own
defense,
I

it
perfectly.
Did
you

my

Did
you
just
kill
my
new
wife?!
Of
course
not!
What
do
you
mean?
How
do
you
know
that
I
told
you,
I
timed
it
perfectly.
What
does
that
mean?!
-Calm
down.
By
the
time
I've
explained,
I'm
sorry,
madam.
You
can't
use
the
lavatory
That
was
no
accident.
It
was
by
design.
Now,
do
you
need
me
to
elaborate...
...or
can
we
just
crack
on?
Come
on!
Don't
worry,
old
boy,
She's
with
my
brother.
I'm
on
my
honeymoon!
Why
did
you
lead
them
here?!
They
aren't
here
for
me!

We
are

I

Your

Make
it

I

Who'd

that
what
this

about?
By
your

Any
