Put
your
hands

I

them.
I

do,
Now,
with
your
right
hand

package

in
here.
Fuck.
Behind

On
the
right.



Yeah,
Roger
Van
Zant?
-
Yeah,

this?
Yes,
I

Yes,
I
do.
I
sent
a
guy
to
deliver
the
package.
NEIL
:
-
What?
Wh...
It's
a
lot
of
money.
What
are
you
doing?
What
am
I
doing?
I
don't
understand.
-
Because
there
is
a
dead
man

Oh,
my.
MICHAEL:
Do
you
like
it?
-
Wow.
Did
you
know
about
this?
You
are
insane.
Do
you
like
it?
-
It's
beautiful.
-
Just
don't
ask
him
where
he
got
it.
MICHAEL:
What
do
you
wanna
be
I
don't
know.

She
doesn't
know.


Hello?
Hi,
it's
me.
Hey.
I
was
wondering
if
you'd
call.
I've
been
busy.
Can
I
see
you?
I
was
afraid
that
was
just
the
one
night,
No,
not
for
me,
it
wasrt.
Yeah,
me
neither.
Can
I
fall
by?
-
Yeah.
ELAINE:
-
Good
night.
VINCENT:
-
Which
one's
Slick?
Got
two
transmitters.
One's
in
the
wheel
well,
Okay,
get
ready.
-
Did
you
say
good
night
to
Neil?
One
with
the
blond
hair
is
Chris
Shiherlis.
...and
hung
a
wire
on
the
house
phone.
Cheritto's
cruised
the
precious-metals
Platinum,
silver,
and
some
bullion.
Sammy
and
I
think
that's
gonna
Who's
the
loner?
First
time
we're
seeing
him.
Well,
get
on
it.
Okay.
When
these
guys
walk
out
the
door
...they're
gonna
have
the
surprise
Hey,
baby.
Time
to
go.
WAINGRO:
Oh,
yeah.
You
fly.
You
cool.
You're
lying
to
me.
Mm,
I
ain't
lying.
You
a
hot
dog.
A
regular
rodeo
rider.
And
this
was
the
monster
fuck

Now
I
got
to
get
my
ass
You
don't
have
a
truth-telling
style.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
Grim
Reaper's
visiting
with
you.
BARTENDER:
SHU
at
Pelican
Bay.
New
Folsom,
B-wing.
I
am
a
cowboy
Billy
Ricketts
said
come
see
you.
That
is
why
I
am
here.
BARTENDER:
Why
don't
you
call
this
guy?
This
guy's
always
putting
guys
on.
Thank
you,
brother.
MAN:
I'll
buy
you
a
drink?

-
What's
so
funny?
-
It's
really
dumb.
You
two
are
perfect
for
each
other.

-
I
knew
this
guy
in,
uh,
grade
school.
He
was
named
Raoul,
uh...
Whatever.
Anyway,
the
guy
could
take
his
fingers
Then
he'd
turn
his
eyelids
inside
out...
I
can't
keep
my
hands
off
you,
That's
what's
so
wonderful
about
you,
Woman.


This
better
be
earth-shattering.
That's
what
she
tells
us.
To
Raoul.
-
Raoul.
Yeah,
Vincent
Hanna.
Here's
how
we
found
her.
-
How
old?
Been
here
about
six
hours.
How'd
she
die,
Rachel?
Beat
her
head
in,
same
as
the
others.
VINCENT:
-
Mother
and
siblings,
I
guess.
Because
it's
fucked
up.
Somebody
inside
Okay,
let's
go.
That's
nice.
When
I
run
a
DNA
check
on
the
semen,
my
So
it's
a
series,
-
Sheriff"s
Homicide
getting
anywhere?
-
Get
her.
Oh,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
-
Oh,
my
God.

-
Where
is
she?
Please.
Please,
come
on.
-
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Where's
my
baby?
Where
is
she?
I
need
to
know
what
happened.
I
guess
the
Earth
shattered.
So
why
didn't
you
let
Bosko
I
didn't
wanna
ruin
their
night
too.
You
don't
wanna
know.
I'd
like
to
know
I
don't
do
that.
You
know
it.
You
never
told
me
I'd
be
excluded.
I
told
you
when
we
hooked
up,
baby,
...with
all
the
bad
people
And
I
bought
into
that
sharing
I
love
you
fat,
bald,
money,
no
money,
But
you
have
got
to
be
present
That's
sharing.
Oh,
I
see.
What
I
should
do
"Hi,
honey,
guess
what?
...where
this
junkie
asshole
...because
it
was
crying
too
loud,
Come
on,
let's
share
that,
...we'll
somehow,
uh,
cathartically
dispel
Wrong.
You
know
why?
Because
you
prefer
the
normal
routine:
We
fuck,
Because
I
gotta
hold
on
to
my
angst.
I
preserve
it,
because
I
need
it.
Where
I
gotta
be.
You
don't
live
with
me.
You
live
among
the
remains
You
read
the
terrain.
You
search
for
signs
of
passing...
...for
the
scent
of
your
prey...
...and
then
you
hunt
them
down.
That's
the
only
thing
The
rest
is
the
mess
you
leave
What
I
don't
understand
is
DON:
Let's
go,
baby.
I
met
the
manager.
Is
that
the
boss?
I
did
time
for
what
that
motherfucker
does
Baby,
can
you
just
handle
it
Can
you
do
that?
Ain't
a
hard
time
been
invented
What
you
hanging
with
me
for,
Lillian?
Because
I'm
proud
of
you.

-
You're
proud
of
me?
What
the
hell
you
proud
of
me
for?
Come
on
home.
NEIL:
What
were
you
doing
there?
I
was
trying
to
ski.
That's
what
people
do
there.
...you
meet
people.
You
try
to
have
a
good
time.
-
Did
you
have
a
good
time?
Why
not?
I'm
not
good
at
meeting
people.
You
met
me.
Well,
that
happened
Which
is
why,
probably.
No,
it's
because
you
were
fine.
Eady.
Take
off
with
me
for
a
while.
-
Where?

When?
I
have
to
go
separate,
But
my
job,
my...
I
got
money.
You
don't
need
money.
-
I
don't
know.
Are
you
married?
-
What?
The
last
thing
I
am
is
married.
I'm
a
needle
starting
at
zero
Then,
all
of
a
sudden...
...someone
like
you
comes
along.
-
You
don't
know
me,
Neil.
Come
with
me.
What's
wrong,
baby?
Nothing's
wrong.
Everything's
right.
Yeah.
Good.
-
Hey,
sweetie.
What
happened?
No.
So,
what's
going
on?
I
felt
like
being
alone.
Okay.
Come
on,
I'll
drive
you
home.
-
Hey,
Mike.
What's
happening?
Lieutenant.
Sir.
Captain
Jackson
wants
to
know
Nothing's
going
on.
Stay
off
the
air.

Technique.
VINCENT:
VINCENT
:
-
We
walk.
We
walk!
Now!
Come
on.
He's
heard
it.
Heads
up.
-
One's
coming
out.
-
Vincent,
he's
not
carrying
anything.
-
Here
we
go.
Vincent,
both
of
them
-
Okay,
let
them
go.
What
are
you
gonna
take
them
on?
They
didn't
steal
anything.
It
gets
knocked
back
...they
do
six
months
and
they're
out.
I'm
not
taking
the
heat
from
my
boss.
That's
exactly
what
they're
gonna
do.
I
have
tactical
command
They
will
walk
away
Back
to
work.
L.A.P.D.
Gee,
what?
Maybe
it's
the
score
they
were
onto.
The
place,
not
us.
Because
Assume
they
got
our
phones,
...assume
they
got
us
right
here,
Everything.
Assume
it
all.
How
we
gonna
buy
the
bank
package
-
I'll
front
that.
That's
not
a
problem.
With
the
heat
we
got,
do
you
wanna
play
No,
I
want
my
750.
And
he
gets
a
pass?
I
got
more
motivation
to
whack
Van
Zant
Our
problem
is,
Do
not
go
home,
do
not
pack,
nothing.
Thirty
seconds
flat
from
now,
That's
it.
Chris.
The
bank
is
won'th
the
risk.
I
need
it,
brother.
We
should
stay
and
take
it
down.
I
roll
with
you,
Neil.
Whatever.
Whatever.
No,
not
on
this
one,
Michael.
You
figure
this
is
the
best
thing
to
do?
This
is
the
best
thing
to
do?
I
got
plans.
I'm
going
away
after.
So
for
me
But
Elaine
takes
good
care
of
you.
You
got
T-bonds,
real
estate.
If
I
were
you,
I
would
be
smart.

Well,
you
know,
for
me,
I'm
in.
-
You
too?
MICHAEL:
Ha-ha-ha.
MICHAEL:
NEIL:
All
right,
let's
go.
WOMAN:
You
can't
go
in
there.
WOMAN:
Excuse
me...
WOMAN:
ALAN:
Can
I
help
you?
ALAN:
Yeah,
and
who
the
fuck
are
you?

Ow!
Hey.
Hey.

This
is
Las
Vegas.
Hey.
Hey,
I
don't
know
who
the
fuck
...but
I
know
people
here,
okay?
You
are
extradited
to
Newark
...for
smuggling
cigarettes
...or
you
go
to
work
for
us.
Cut
and
dried.
-
That
is
it.
Charlene
Shiherlis.
-
Who?
Who?
What
are
you,
a
fucking
owl?
SCHWARTZ:
The
lady
you
been
talking
dirty
Yeah,
you
know
what?
Who
needs
to?
Your
ass
is
on
a
plane
Oh,
man,
I
just...
Because
she
got
a
great
ass!
And
you
got
your
head
all
the
way
up
it.
ALAN:
When
I
think
of
asses,
a
womars
ass...
...something
comes
out
of
me.
-
So?
All
I
want
is
her
husband
Now,
you're
gonna
work
-
San
Clemente
Road
and
Hermosa.
That's
where
we
cut
through
the
fence.
Right.
The
security
systems
around
here
St.
Vincent
Thomas
Bridge,
Number
2,
over
here,
-
Good.
-
Yeah.
That's
fine.
CASALS:
...in
this
direction.
DRUCKER:
-
For
a
can'tage
theft?
Next
door's
an
oil
refinery,
Refinery
only
pays
by
check.
Same
for
the
scrap
yard.
Maybe
they're
stealing
hubcaps.
A
refinery
and
a
scrap
yard.
-
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
We
thought
we
had
it.
Thought
we
had
it.
I
got
an
idea
-
You
wanna
know
what
they're
looking
at?
I
mean,
is
this
guy
something,
This
crew
is
good.
You
know
what
they
were
looking
at?
What?
Us.
The
L.A.P.D.
The
police
department.
We
just
got
made.

Yeah.
Okay.

Okay,
motherfucker!
Kelso
come
through?
NEIL:
Name
is

First
name
Vincent.
I
smeared
this
sergeant
in

five
yards.
He's
on

the

cars.
Not
yours,
Hanna's
a
hot
dog.
Graduate
school.
Lieutenant,
Robbery-Homicide,
He's
taken
down
some
heavy
crews.
And
he
was
a
fucking
maniac.
He
was
working
Narcotics
before
that.
Current
wife's
Justine.
The
Vice
sergeant...
...says
Hanna
likes
you.
Thinks
you're
some
kind
of
star.
Look
how
sharp
this
guy
is
to
figure
that.

Funny
as
a
heart
attack,
man.
What
the
fuck
do
you
think
that
means?
Means
the
man
is
one
of
those
guys
...prowling
around
all
night,
dedicated.
With
this
guy
and
this
much
heat,
It's
won'th
the
stretch.
This
guy
can
hit
and
miss.
You
sure?
I'm
sure.
Let's
go
to
the
garage.
Justine.
Justine?
Where
we
going?

Okay,
where
are
you
going?

What
do
you

Yeah,

Let's
go.
Seven
years
in
Folsom.
In
the
hole
for
three.
McNeil
before
that.
McNeil
as
tough
as
they
say?
You
looking
to
become
a
penologist?
You're
looking
to
go
back?
...guys
just
looking
to
fuck
up,
You
must've
worked
some
dipshit
crews.
I
worked
all
kinds.
You
see
me
doing
thrill-seeking
...with
a
"Born
to
Lose"
tattoo
-
No,
I
do
not.
I
am
never
going
back.
Then
don't
take
down
scores.
I
do
what
I
do
best,
I
take
scores.
You
do
what
you
do
best,
So
you
never
wanted
a
regular-type
life?
What
the
fuck
is
that?
Yeah.
-
This
regular-type
life
like
your
life?
No,
my
life's
a
disaster
zone.
I
got
a
stepdaughter
so
fucked
up...
...because
her
real
father
I
got
a
wife.
We're
passing
each
other
...my
third...
...because
I
spend
all
my
time
That's
my
life.
A
guy
told
me
one
time:
"Don't
let
yourself
get
attached
...you
are
not
willing
to
walk
out
on
...if
you
feel
the
heat
around
the
corner."
Now,
if
you're
on
me,
...how
do
you
expect
to
keep
a...
Well,
that's
an
interesting
point.
What
are
you,
a
monk?
I
have
a
woman.
What
do
you
tell
her?
I
tell
her
I'm
a
salesman.
So
then,
if
you
spot
me
coming
...you're
just
gonna
walk
out
Not
say
goodbye?
That's
the
discipline.
That's
pretty
vacant,
no?
Yeah,
it
is
what
it
is.
It's
that,
or
we
both
better
I
don't
know
how
to
do
anything
else.
Neither
do
I.
-
I
don't
much
want
to
either.
You
know,
I
have
this,
I'm
sitting
at
this
big
banquet
table...
...and
all
the
victims
of
all
the
murders
...and
they're
staring
at
me
...because
they
got
eight-ball
hemorrhages
And
there
they
are,
...because
I
found
them
two
weeks
The
neighbors
reported
the
smell...
...and
there
they
are,
What
do
they
say?
Nothing.
-
No
talk?
Just...
See,
we
just
look
at
each
other.
They
look
at
me.
I
have
one
where
I'm
drowning.
And
I
gotta
wake
myself
up
You
know
what
that's
about?
Yeah.
Having
enough
time.
-
Enough
time
to
do
what
you
wanna
do?
-
You
doing
it
now?
You
know,
we're
sitting
here...
...you
and
I,
You
do
what
you
do,
And
now
that
we've
been
face
to
face...
...if
I'm
there
and
I
gotta
put
you
away,
But
I'll
tell
you...
...if
it's
between
you
...whose
wife
you're
gonna
...brother,
you
are
going
down.
There's
a
flip
side
to
that
coin.
What
if
you
do
got
me
boxed
in
Because
no
matter
what,
We've
been
face
to
face,
yeah...
...but
I
will
not
hesitate.
Maybe
that's
the
way
it'll
be.
Or
who
knows?
Or
maybe
They
dumped
us.
What?
-
They
dumped
us.
Chris
slipped
his
tail.
He
doesn't
talk
about
scores
...so
there's
nothing
for
me
to
get
-
What
about
Cheritto?
Transponders
got
put
on
a
bus
-
They
dumped
all
our
surveillance?
I
had
coffee
with
McCauley
We
were
on
you.
...where
surveillance
can't
fly
over
His
car's
still
there.
He's
gone.
Does
anybody
have
any
idea


HUGH:
Not
a
thing.
And
not
hearing
This

here.
We
put
him
on.
Who
are
you?
Waingro.
My
name's
Waingro.
I've
been
living
in
this
office
day
and
night.
Oh,
we
took
some
major
scores
together.
How
come
I
haven't
heard
from
him?
Well,
he's
probably
busy
right
now,
-
He
ain't
gonna
forget
about
you.

Well,
I
got
some
moves
Probably
be
a
big
help
to
you.
You
recognize
the
grill
man?
-
No.
-
Ain't
got
my
break
yet,

Haul
out
the
garbage.
Mop
up
the
back.
Take
your
break
later.
Piece
of
shit.
Pick
up.
Where
the
hell
is
he?
-
I
wanted
to
check
the
slot
for
a
work
car.

Yeah?
Hang
on.
-
Yeah.
Use
a
landline.
Call
me
at
103-7206.

You
believe
you
have
to
betray
Chris.
That's
right.
You
would
have
to.
See,
if
you
don't
betray
Chris,
Because
he
becomes
an
orphan
...because
you
got
no
living
parents
So
he
ends
up
state-raised
in
foster
homes,
Then
he
steals
a
car.
Then
he
winds
up
in
gladiator
academies
Fucked
for

Units

Now,
if

goes
after
anybody
else,
Waingro
just
got
himself

suite
...under
the

"Jameson."
I
want
you

you

I
