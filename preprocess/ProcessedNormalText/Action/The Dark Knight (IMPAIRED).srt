not

I'm

I
like
reminding

Why
wouldn't
he

Hopefully...
...because
he's

That's

Don't

we
get

minute,

Who
are
the
others?
Another
bunch
of
small
timers.

BATMAN:
My
detectives
have
been
This
bank
was
another
drop
for
the
Mob.
-We
found
the
bulk
of
their
dirty
cash.
We'd
have
to
hit
all
banks
What
about
this
Joker
guy?
One
man
or
the
entire
Mob?
He
can
wait.
When
the
new
DA
hears
about
this,
-Do
you
trust
him?
I
hear
he's
as
stubborn
as
you
are.
ALFRED:
You
can
swap

Whenever

You

carrying
too
much

I'm
sure
Mr.

can
oblige.
-Did
you
get
mauled
by
a
tiger?
-Huh?
There
were
more
copycats
last
night,
Why
don't
you
hire
them
and
That
wasn't
exactly
...when
I
said
I
wanted
I
know.
But
things
have
improved.
Look
at
the
new

to

no

you
do,
sir.
And
what's
gonna
happen
We
all
know
how
much
you
like
to
say
On
that

Probably.

-Harvey,

wouldn't

played

More
than
enough
time
With

...someone
must

stepped
up

that

in
this

today?
-Could
you
identify
him
for
us,
please?
It
was
me.

I
have
a
sworn
statement
from
you
...Salvatore

is
the

He's
a

[CROWD

We'll
never

the
fact
that

I'm
glad
you're
so
pleased,

Come
on,

You're

about

bold.

gonna
count

in?

don't

that

to

"l
believe

it
caught

And
then
I
started
to
pay
attention
...and
all
that
he's
been
doing
And
you
know

I
believe
in

I

I
don't

How'd
they
get

Somebody
with

Is
it
the

You
wanna

I

Come
here.
Hey.
Look
at

So
I
had
a

tells
me
I
worry
too
much...
...who
tells
me
I
ought
to
smile
more...
...who
gambles
and
gets
in
deep
One
day
they
carve
her
face.
And
we
have
no
money
for
surgeries.
I
just
wanna
see
her
smile
again.
Hm?
I
just
want
her
to
know
So...
...I
stick
a
razor
in
my
mouth
...to
myself.
And
you
know
what?
She
leaves.
Now
I
see
the
funny
side.
Now
I'm
always
smiling.

You
got
a
little

in
you.
I

that.

That's
the

He's

you're

right.

REPORTER:
Gotham
P.D.
BARTENDER:
Sweet
Jesus.
Shouldn't
you
be
out
there,
It's
my
day
off.
I
gotta
take
a
leak.
Keep
an
eye
out
for
me,
will
you?

Now
what?
DENT:
Dent.
Jesus.
I
thought
you
was
dead.
Half.
Who
picked
up
Rachel,
Wuertz?
-lt
must've
been
Maroni's
men.
Are
you
telling
me
...the
other
traitor
in
Gordon's
unit?
I
don't
know,
he
never
told
me.
Listen,
Dent,
I
swear
to
God,
I
didn't
That's
funny...
...because
I
don't
know

Beautiful,
isn't
it?
Beautiful.
Unethical.
Dangerous.
You've
turned
every
cell
phone
BATMAN:
You
took
my
sonar
concept
With
half
the
city
feeding
you
sonar,
This
is
wrong.
I've
gotta
find
this
man,
Lucius.
At
what
cost?
The
database
is
null-key
encrypted.
It
can
only
be
accessed
by
one
person.
This
is
too
much
power
for
one
person.
That's
why
I
gave
it
to
you.
Only
you
can
use
it.
Spying
on
30
million
people
This
is
an
audio
sample.
If
he
talks
...you
can
triangulate
his
position.
I'll
help
you
this
one
time.
But
consider
this
my
resignation.
As
long
as
this
machine
is
When
you're
finished...
...type
in
your
name.

GORDON:
My
officers
are
going
over
...but
with
the
Joker's
threat,
-And
land
routes
east?
Which
leaves
the
ferries
Plus,
I
wanna
use
the
ferries
so
I
can
The
men
you
and
dent
put
away?
You
should
be.
...it's
a
good
bet
Harvey's
prisoners
might
be
So
where
is
Harvey?
-We
haven't
found
him.
How
long
can
you
keep
this
quiet?
Don't
stop
for
lights,
cops,
nothing.
Going
to
join
your
wife?
-You
love
her?
You
ever
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
Look,
take
it
up
with
the
Joker.
He
killed
your
woman.
He
made
you...
...like
this.
The
Joker's
just
a
mad
dog.
I
want
whoever
let
him
off
the
leash.
I
took
care
of
Wuertz,
but
who
is
Who
picked
up
Rachel?
Look,
if
I
tell
you...
...will
you
let
me
go?
Can't
hurt
your
chances.
It
was
Ramirez.

-But
you
said--
You're
a
lucky
man.
-But
he's
not.

Assemble

At

I

up.
If,
however,
one
of
you
presses
So
who's
it
gonna
be?
Harvey
Dent's
most-wanted

or
the
sweet

innocent

You
choose.
Oh,
and
you
might
wanna

the

on
the
other

Stay
back.
Well,
now,
who
are
you
to
decide?
We
don't
all
have
to
die.
-We
are
not
going
to
talk
about
this.
They're
talking
over
the
same
exact
-Let's
put
it
to
a
vote.


-Hello?
Jim
needs
you
to
pack
up
But
the
units
outside....
Those
cops
can't
be
trusted.
Jim
needs
you
away
from
them
I'll
call
them
off
for
10
minutes,
-But
where
am
I
supposed
to
take
them?
Leave
as
soon
as
Okay.
She
believe
you?
It's
because
she
trusts
you...
...just
like
Rachel
did.
-I
didn't
know--
You're
the
second
cop
to
say
that
to
me.
What
exactly
did
you
think
They
got
me
early
on.
-Don't!
You
live
to
fight
another
day,
officer.
SWAT

It's
a

Why
would
he
choose
a

SWAT
LEADER:
Snipers
take
them
out,
Team

stairwells.
Two,
three

-Let's

-With

If
anyone's
got

pass

along.
GUARDSMAN:
Thank
you.
Coming

Anybody
else?
COMMANDER:
Come

PRlSONER

What
are
you
waiting
for?
PRlSONER
2:
I
need
five
minutes
alone.
No!
There's
no
time!
We
have
clear
shots!
Dent
is
in
there
with
them.
I
have
to
save
Dent.
Get
ready.
Two
minutes,
then
we
breach.

Fox,
I
need
picture.

-Hello?
FOX:
...omni

beta.
Looks
like
clowns
and
hostages
There's
a
SWAT
team
on
the
stairwell.
Another
SWAT
team
on
the
roof.
TEAM
LEADER:
-Barbara,
calm
down.
DENT:
Hello,
Jim.
-Where's
my
family?

SWAT

Entry

BATMAN:

The
clowns

Red

SWAT

or

be--
FOX:
See
those
bad
guys
on
the
floor
above?
They're
waiting
to
ambush
SWAT
LEADER:
The
tally
is
140

396

So
go
ahead.
Do
it.
We're
still
here.
And
that

Uh-oh.

Be

Clowns

Ah,
you
made
it.
I'm
so
thrilled.
-Where's
the
detonator?



SWAT
13:
Put
down
your
weapon!

You
don't
wanna
die...
...but
you
don't
know
how
to
take
a
life.
Give
it
to
me.
These
men
will
kill
you
No
one
wants
to
get
their
hands
dirty.
Fine.
I'll
do
it.
Those
men
on
that
boat?
They
chose
to
murder
and
steal.
It
doesn't
make
any
sense
All
the
old
familiar
places.
FOX:

SWAT
2:
Red
team,
floor
secure.
Give
it
to
me.
You
can
tell
them
I
took
it
by
force.
Give
it
to
me,
and
I'll
do
what

We
really
should
stop
this
fighting,
There
won't
be
any
fireworks.
And
here
we
go.
What
were
you
trying
to
prove?
That
deep
down,
You're
alone.
Can't
rely
on
anyone
these
days.
You
That's
okay.
I
came
prepared.
It's
a
funny
world
we
live
in.
Speaking
of
No,
but
I
know
how
you
got
these.


Oh,
you.
You
just
couldn't
let
me
go,
could
you?
This
is
what
happens
...meets
an
immovable
object.
You
truly
are
incorruptible,
aren't
you?
Huh?
You
won't
kill
me...
...out
of
some
misplaced
sense
And
I
won't
kill
you...
...because
you're
just
too
much
fun.
I
think
you
and
I
are
destined
You'll
be
in
a
padded
cell
forever.
Maybe
we
could
share
one.
You
know,
...the
rate
this
city's
inhabitants
This
city
just
showed
you...
...that
it's
full
of
people
Until
their
spirit
breaks
completely.
Until
they
get
a
good
look
...and
all
the
heroic
things
he's
done.
You
didn't
think
I'd
risk
losing
the
battle
...in
a
fistfight
with
you?
No.
You
need
an
ace
in
the
hole.
Mine's
Harvey.
What
did
you
do?
I
took
Gotham's
white
knight...
...and
I
brought
him
down
to
our
level.
It
wasn't
hard.
...is
like
gravity.
All
it
takes
is
a
little
push.

Dent!
DENT:
This
is
where
they
brought
her,
This
is
where
she
died.
I
know,
I
was
here...
-...trying
to
save
her.
-I
couldn't.
If
you'd
listened
to
me.
If
you
stood
up
against
corruption...
...instead
of
doing
your
deal
I
was
trying
to
fight
the
Mob!
You
wouldn't
dare
try
to
justify
yourself
Have
you
ever
had
to
talk
to
the
person
...tell
them
it's
gonna
be
all
right,
Well,
you're
about
to
know
Then
you
can
look
me
in
the
eye
-You're
not
going
to
hurt
my
family.
Just
the
person
you
love
most.

So
is
it
your
wife?
Put
the
gun
down,
Harvey.
Harvey,
put
down
the
gun.
Please.
Please,
Harvey.
Please.
Oh,
goddamn
it.
Will
you
stop
pointing
that
gun
BARBARA:
No!
No,
Jim,
stop
him!
GORDON:
Harvey.
Harvey!

I'm
sorry!
For
everything.
Please
don't
hurt
my
son.


You
brought
your
cops?
All
they
know
is
there's
a
situation.
They
don't
know
who
or
what.
You
think
I
wanna
escape
from
this?
There
is
no
escape
from
this.
You
don't
wanna
hurt
the
boy,
Harvey.
It's
not
about
what
I
want,
You
thought
we
could
be
decent
men
But
you
were
wrong.
The
world
is
cruel.
And
the
only
morality
...is
chance.
Unbiased.
Unprejudiced.
Fair.
His
son's
got
the
same
chance
she
had.
Fifty-fifty.
What
happened
to
Rachel
wasn't
We
three.
Then
why
was
it
me
who
was
-It
wasn't.
Because
you
were
the
best
of
us.
He
wanted
to
prove
that
...could
fall.
And
he
was
right.
You're
the
one
pointing
the
gun,
Harvey.
So
point
it
at
the
people
responsible.
Fair
enough.
You
first.
My
turn.
Harvey,
you're
right.
Rachel's
death
was
my
fault.
Please
don't
punish
the
boy.
-Please,
punish
me.
Tell
your
boy
Lie...
...Like
I
lied.
It's
going
to
be
all
right,
son.


Dad?
Daddy,
is
he
okay?

-Thank
you.
Yes,
I
do.
The
Joker
won.
Harvey's
prosecution,
...undone.
Whatever
chance
you
gave
us
at
fixing
We
bet
it
all
on
him.
The
Joker
took
the
best
of
us
People
will
lose
hope.
They
won't.
They
must
never
know
what
he
did.
Five
dead.
Two
of
them
cops.
-You
can't
sweep
that--
But
the
Joker
cannot
win.
Gotham
needs
its
true
hero.
-No.
...or
you
live
long
enough
I
can
do
those
things...
...because
I'm
not
a
hero,
not
like
Dent.
I
killed
those
people.
No,
no,
you
can't.
You're
not.
I'm
whatever
Gotham
needs
me
to
be.
Call
it
in.
GORDON:
Not
the
hero
we
deserved,
Nothing
less
than
a
knight...
...shining.
GORDON:
BATMAN:
You'll
condemn
me.
Set
the
dogs
on
me.
Because
that's
what
needs
to
happen.
Because
sometimes...
...
the
truth
isn't
good
enough.
Sometimes
people
deserve
more.
Sometimes
people
deserve

JAMES:
Batman!
Why's
he
running,
Dad?
Because
we
have
to
chase
him.
Okay,
we're
going
in!
Go,
go!
Move!
He
didn't
do
anything
wrong.

Because
he's
the
hero
Gotham
deserves,
So
we'll
hunt
him...
...because
he
can
take
it.
Because
he's
not
our
hero.
He's
a
silent
guardian...
...a
watchful
protector.
The
Dark
Knight.
