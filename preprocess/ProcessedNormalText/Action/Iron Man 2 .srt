in
two
years.
Oh

my
god!
-
I
got
him!
Give
me
the
case.
-
I
hit
him!
Give
him
the
case!
Oh,
god!
Give
me
the
case!
Please!
You'll
lose!
You'll
lose.
You'll
lose,
Stark.
We've
checked
his
fingerprints.
Nothing.
-
Where
are
we
going?
He
may
not
understand
us.
In
fact,
he
has
not
even
spoken.
Five
minutes.
Pretty
decent
tech.
Cycles
You
could
double
up
your
rotations,
You
focused
the
Repulsor
energy
Effective.
Not
very
efficient.
I
don't
get
it.
With
a
little
fine
tuning
if
you
sold
it
to
North
Korea,
Iran,
or
gone
right
to
You
look
like
you
got
friends
in
low
places.
You
come
from
a
family
of
thieves
and
butchers.
And
now,
try
to
rewrite
your
and
you
forget
all
the
lives
that
Stark
family
has
destroyed.
Speaking
of
thieves,
My
father.
Well
I've
never
heard
of
him.
My
father
is
the
reason
you're
alive.
The
reason
I'm
alive
is
cause
you
had
a
shot,
Did
I?
If
you
can
make
god
bleed
people
will
cease
to
believe
him.
And
there
will
be
blood
in
the
water.
and
the
sharks
will
come.
The
truth,
all
they
have
to
do
is
sit
and
watch
as
the
world
will
consume
you.
Where
will
you
be
watching
the
world
That's
right.
A
prison
cell.
Hey
Tony,
before
you
go,
palladium
in
the
chest,

It's
just
unbelievable
it
proves

and
this
man

He
thinks
of
the
Iron
Man

I
was
at
a
hearing
where

that
these
suits
can't
exist,

anywhere
else,
don't
exist
anywhere
else,

at
least
for
5-10
years

realizing,
uh-oh,
these
suits
exist
now
Mute.
He
should
be
giving
me
a
medal.
That's
the
truth.
What
is
that?
This
is
your
in-flight
meal.
-
Did
you
just
make
that?
Where
do
you
think
I've
been
for
three
hours?
Tony
...
What
are
you
not
telling
me?
I
don't
want
to
go
home
...
at
all.
Let's
cancel
We're
in
Europe.
-
Remember?
It's
a
great
place
to...
be
healthy.
I
don't
think
this
is
the
right
time.
We
are
in
a
kind
of
a
mess.
Yeah
but
maybe
that's
why
it's
the
best
time.
Wow,
I
think
as
the
CEO
I
need
to
show
up.
-
As
CEO
-
leave?
A
retreat?
During
a
time
like
this?
I'm
just
saying
to
recharge
our
batteries
Not
everybody
runs
on
batteries,
Tony.
Have
fun
with
the
Püree
Prisoner
stop!
What
are
you
doing?
Hey,
here
he
is!
There
he
is!
What
an
absolute
pleasure.
Welcome.
Goodness
gracious,
can
we
get
the
handcuffs
Forgive
me,
I'm
sorry.
I'm
such
a
huge
fan
of
yours.
I
didn't
wanna...
make
a
first
impression
like
this.
He's
not
an
animal.
Come
on.
He's
a
human
being.
Thank
you.
Leave
us.
Oui,
oui,
I'm
fine.
My
name
is
Justin
Hammer.
I'd
like
to
do
some
business
with
you.
Please
sit.
Dig
in.
Some
salmon
carpaccio,
sir.
Salmon
carpaccio?
Anything
you
want
here,
we
got
it.
I
like
my
dessert
first.
I
had
this
flown
in
from
It's
Italian
though.
Organic
ice
cream.
I
got
a
sweet
tooth.
for
Tony
Stark.
When
I
saw
what
you
do
to
how
you
stepped
up
to
him
in
front
of
that
was
wow!
You
spoke
to
me
was
what
you
did.
And
I
know
that
you
knew
that
This
is
why
I
couldn't
bear
to
have
you
shipped
off
It
would've
been
such
a
waste
of
talent.
But
if
I
might
make
a
suggestion
you
know
and
try
to
kill
the
guy.
I
think...
if
I
may,
you
go
after
his
legacy.
That's
what
you
should
kill.
You
and
me
we're
a
lot
alike
in
a
lot
of
ways.
The
only
difference
between
you
and
I
is
that
I
have
resources.
I
think,
if
I
may,
you
need
my
resources.
Someone
behind
you.
A
benefactor.
Okay.
because
I
can
get
a
translator.
I
don't
know
if
you've
been
understanding
-
Very
good,
man.
Very
good,
man.
-
Yes.
A
bird?
-
You
want
a
bird?
I
can
get
you
bird
-
I
want
my
bird.
nothing's
impossible.
I
could,
are
we
talking
about...
Yes,
but
the
fundamentals
of
the
company
despite
the
events
in
Monaco.
Oh,
oh,
fax
them.
-
Where
is
he?
He's
downstairs.
His
continuing
erratic
behavior
may
lead
many
people
to
ask
themselves
can
this
man
still
protect
us?
Iron
Man
never
stopped
protecting
us.
The
events
in
Monaco
prove
that.
Query
complete,
sir.
Anton
Vanko
was
who
defected
to
the
United
States

However,
he
was
accused
of
espionage
deported
in
1967.
His
son,
Ivan,
who
is
also
a
physicist,
was
convicted
of
selling
to
Pakistan
and
served
15
years
No
further
records
exist.
Tony,
you
gotta
get
upstair
Listen,
I've
been
on
the
phone
with
the
all
day
trying
to
talk
them
out
of
rolling
tanks
and
the
PCH
knocking
down
your
front
door
They're
gonna
take
your
suits,
Tony,
they're
sick
of
the
games.
You
said
nobody
else
would
possess
this
technology
Well
guess
what,
It's
not
theoretical
anymore.
Are
you
listening
to
me?
Are
you
okay?
Let's
go.
-
Are
you
alright?
-
See
that
cigar
box?
It's
palladium.
Is
that
supposed
to
be
smoking?
If
you
must
know
it's
from
that
reactor
wall.
You
had
this
And
how
about
the
high-tech
Rogue
rash.
Thank
you.
-
What
are
you
looking
at?
You
wanna
do
this
whole
lone
gunslinger
act
and
it's
unnecessary.
You
know
I
wish
I
could
believe
that.
But
you
gotta
trust
me.
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
This
is
where
we
do
it
You
can
work
in
absolute
peace.
Must
be
kinda
fun
to
be
dead,
right
Ah,
here
they
are.
I
may
have
done
a
few
miscalculations
and
rushed
the
prototype,
but
sue
me,
I'm
enthusiastic.
Oh,
you
don't
wanna
do
that.
You'll
be
able
to
access
that
as
soon
as
Can
we
generate
some
encrypted
passcodes?
encrypted
passcodes,
Jack.
Nevermind.
Wow,
okay.
Good
stuff.
-
Sorry?
You're
good.
You
really
blasted
and
Let
me
show
you
where
Go
ahead,
take
a
look.
Take
a
good
look
at
that.
You
know
they're
really
just
for
show
and
tell.
They're
125.7
million
a
pop.
Jeez,
could
you
get
somebody
to
help?
That's
where
the
pilot
goes.
I'm
having
a
tough
time
finding
volunteers.
I'll
take
care
of
that
just
leave
it.
What
you
want
them
do?
Long
term
the
Pentagon
for
the
I
wanna
make
Iron
Man
look
I
wanna
go
to
that
Stark
Expo
and
take
a
dump
on
Tony's
front
yard.
-
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about?
-
Yes?
Hey,
fabulous
This
is
our
guy.
Didn't
I
tell
you?
Do
you
know
which
watch
you'd
like
I'll
give
them
a
look.
I
should
cancel
the
party
now?
-
Probably.
-
Ill-timed.
Inappropriate.
Is
that
dirty
enough
for
you?
Gold
faced
with
the
brown
band...
The
Jaeger.
Bring
them
over
here.
I'll
take
that.
I
gotta
say
it's
hard
to
-
Where
are
you
from?
Can
I
ask
you
a
question
hypothetically?
If
this
was
your
last
birthday
party
you're
ever
I'd
do
whatever
I
wanted
to
do.
with
whoever
I
wanted
to
do
it.
Yes,
sir,
I
understand.
No,
sir,
that
will
not
be
necessary.
Sir,
I
personally
guarantee
that
Iron
Man
will
be
Hey,
Pepper
...
-
I'm
gonna
go
get
some
air.
-
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
-
That's
it,
I'm
gonna
make
a...
This
is
ridiculous
I
just
stuck
my
neck
up
I
know.
I
get
it.
I'm
gonna
handle
it
okay,
Handle
it,
or
I'm
gonna
have
to.
You
know
the
question
I
get
asked
most
often
is
Just
like
that.
Does
this
guy
know
how
to
throw
a
party
I
love
you.
Unbelievable.
Thank
you
so
much
wonderful
night.
We're
gonna
say
and
thank
you
all
for
coming.
No,
no,
wait,
we
can't,
we
didn't
bring
out
the
cake
-
You're
out
of
control
okay
-
Trust
me
on
this
one
okay?
-
It's
time
to
go
to
bed.
Come
on
you
know
you
want
to.
You
just
peed
the
suit.
-
I
know,
has
a
filtration
system.
-
You
can
drink
that
water.
-
It's
time
to...
Okay,
I'll
take
this.
You
take
that.
Pepper
Potts.
She's
right.
Then
again
the
party
was
over
for
me
The
after
party
And
if
anybody,
Pepper,
doesn't
like
it,
there's
the
door.
Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Me!
I
think
she
wants
the
Gallanger!
There
you
go!
I'm
only
gonna
say
this
once.
Get
out!
You
don't
deserve
to
wear
one
of
these.
Goldstein.
Yes,
Mr.
Stark?
Give
me
a
fat
beat
to
beat
I
told
you
to
shut
it
down.
Now,
put
that
thing
back
where
you
found
it
Really?
Sorry
pal,
but
Suck
at
this!
Had
enough?
-
Natalie!
Don't
you
Ms.
Potts
me.
I'm
on
to
you.
Pepper!
Let's
get
out
of
here!
You
want
it?
Out!
Put
your
hand
down.
You
think
you
got
what
it
takes
-
We
don't
have
to
do
this,
Tony.
-
Take
your
shot.
-
You're
gonna
take
your
shot?
-
Drop

I'm
gonna
have
to
ask
you
I
told
you
I
don't
wanna
No,
see,
I
remember,
you
do
How's
it
workin
out
for
you?
I'm
sorry,
I
don't
wanna

off
on
the
wrong
Honestly
I'm
a
bit
hungover
I
am
very
real.
I'm
the
realest
-
Just
my
luck.
Where
is
the
staff
here?
It's
getting
worse.
We've
secured
the
perimeter,
but
I
don't
think
-
You're
fired.
-
Tony...
I
want
you
to
meet
agent
Romanoff
I'm
a
Shield
shadow
I
suggest
you
apologize.
You've
been
very
busy.

You

What
do
you
want
from
me?
What
do
you
want
from
me.
You
have
become
a
problem,
a
problem

Contrary
to
your
belief,
you
are
not
I
have
bigger
problems
than
you
in
the
Southwest
Are
you
gonna
steal
my
kidney
and
sell
it?
Could
you
please
not
do
anything
What
did
you
just
do
to
me?
What
did
we
just
do
for
you.
That's
lithium
dioxide.
It's
gonna
take
the
edge
off.
-
Give
me
a
couple
of
boxes
and
I'll
be
right
as
rain.
-
Then
the
lag
is
gonna
be
an
easy
fix.
I've
been
looking
for
a
suitable
replacement
I've
tried
every
combination,
every
permutation
of
Well,
I'm
here
to
tell
you
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Candygram!
I
brought
you
something.
-
We
got
you
the
bird,
pal.
What
do
you
mean?
I
pulled
a
lot
of
strings
-
It's
a
great
bird.
-
We
got
this
all
the
way
from
Russia.
Well
listen,
even
if
it's
not
the
bird,
I
mean,
look,
don't
get
so
attached
to
Wait
a
minute.
Is
that...
Ivan...
What's
this?
Is
that
a
helmet?
It
doesn't
look
like
a
helmet
-
Jack,
could
you
put
your
head
in
there?
-
No.
Go
ahead,
try
to
put
your
head
in
there.
See
Ivan,
he
can't
put
his
head
in
That's
not
a
helmet,
it's
a
head.
I
need
to
put
a
guy
in
there.
I
need
to
fit
a
person
Drone
better.
What?
Drone
better?
Why
drone
better?
People
make
problem.
Trust
me,
Ivan,
you
know
I
like
you.
You
said
no
problem.
Now
I
need
suits.
Like
Iron
Man,
you
understand?
That's
what
the
people
want.
Hey,
man...
Don't
get
to
attached
to
things.
Learn
to
let
go.
These
drones
better
steal
the
show,
Ivan.
You
understand?
They

Unbelievable.
This
ought
to
get
the
Senate
off
my
ass.
-
It's
functional?
Good.

here
Sir?
Justin

We've
got
to
make
this
happen.

had
the
misfortune
of
You
told
me
I
hadn't
tried
everything.
What
haven't
I
tried?
He
said
that
you
were
the
only
person
with
the
to
finish
what
he
started.
He
said
that?
Are
you
that
guy?
Because
if
you
are
then
I
don't
know
where
you
get
your
information,
but
-
What
do
your
remember
about
your
dad
huh?
He
never
told
me
he
loved
me
So
it's
a
little
tough
for
me
to
digest
what're
you
telling
and
he's
passing
it
down...
We're
talking
about
a
guy

when
he
shipped
me
off
to
boarding
school.
That's
not
true.
Well,

a

of

I
did.

thing

this
is
not
a
scientific
exercise.
Let's
just
focus
Yes,
sir.

Oh,
yes!
Oh,
yes,
yes,
yes!
Is
it
my
birthday?
You
gotta..
what
did
you
do?

Is
this
what
I
think
it
is?
Hammer,
I
want
to
know
What
am
I
gonna
do
for
you?
First
thing
I'm
gonna
do
for
you
is
I'm
talking
about
firepower.
Well
you're
talking
to
the
right
guy.
Claridge

I
can
tell
this
isn't
so
I'm
gonna
put
it
right
here.

A

That's
the

I
got.
How
are
you
gonna
do
this?
Give
me
something.
I
can't
read
you.
I
think
I'll
take
it.

Which
one?
All
of
it?
Action.
Everything
is
achievable
through

Better

So,
from
all
of
us
in

Tony?
What
are
you
doing
back
there?
Put
it
back.
Where
is
your
mother?
Go
on,
go,
go,
go...
Sorry
I
think
we
got
the...
I'll
come
in

there...
Are
you
waiting
on
me?
So
from
all
of
us
in

my
ass.
I'd
like
to...
This...
That
looks
ridiculous.
Everything...
is
achievable...
through
technology.
Tony...
You're
too
young
to
understand
this
right
now

I
built
this
for
you.

And
someday
you'll
realize
that
it
represents
It
represents
my
life's
work.
This
is
key
to
the
future.
I'm
limited
by
the
technology

But
one
day
you'll
figure
this
out.
And
when
you
do...

What
is
and
always
will
be
is
you.
Hi,
sir.
-
$6.
-
No
sir,
that's
too
much.
Take
it,
take
it.
I
don't
like
people
hand
me
things

if
you

Are
you

We
believe
in
you!

Ms.
Potts,
Mr
Stark
is...
-
He
refuses
to...
It's
our
position
that
Stark
has
the
means
to
maintain
When
Mr.
Stark
announced
he
was
the
Iron
Man
he
was
making
a
promise
to
America.
Obviously
he
did
not.
Now
we
learn
that
his
secretary,
a
woman
named
has
been
appointed
CEO
What
are
her
qualifications?
No.

Ms.
Potts
is
doing
nothing
to
manage
the
terrible
Bert,
don't
tell
me
that
we
have
the
and
then
not
let
me
pursue
this.
I'll
get
this
stuff
out
of
here.
Well
then,
tell
the
President
We'll
talk
about
it
at
the

Will
Tony

No,

you
just
got
off
the

I
was
driving
over
here,
and
I
thought
-
You
didn't
come
here
to
apologize?
But
I
haven't
been
entirely
up
front
and
I
just
wanna
try
to
make
good,
Can
I
move
this?
No.
Do
you
know
how
short
life
is?
And
if
I
never
got
to
express...
and
by
the
way
somewhat
revelatory
to
me,
I
don't
care...
I
mean,
I
care,
it
would
be
nice,
I'm
not
expecting
you
to...
Let
me
just
stop
you
right
here,
okay,
one
more
time,
I'm
gonna
actually
hurl
I
am
trying
to
run
a
company.
Yes.
People
are

I'm
doing

you

me
strawberries?
Did
you

You're
allergic
to

uh-uh.
This
is
progress,
Pepper.
I
knew
there

I
need
you...
to
leave
now.
Ms
Potts.
-
Hi,
come
on
in.
Thank
you.
Anything
else,
boss?
-
I'm
good
Hap.
I
lost
both
the
kids
in
the

No.
Are
you
blending
in
well
here,
Natalie?
Here
at

Enterprises.
Your
name
is
Natalie,
isn't
it?
I
thought
you
two
-
No,
that's
not
so.
No?
Nothing?
Actually
while
you're
here
maybe
you
and
Natalie
Absolutely.
-
I'm
surprised
you
could
keep
your
mouth
shut.
How
do
you
do
it?
You're
a
triple
impostor.
Is
there
anything
real
about
you?
Fallaces
sunt
rerum
species.
Which
means?
It
means
you
can

It
was

What
does
that
look
like
to

Not
unlike
an

What
can
we
make

is
a

I
can

You
can
make

do
you

What
the
hell
does
that
mean,
Ivan?
It's
not
what
we
agreed

okay.
You
promised

and
then
you
promised

Hey
man,
everything
will
be
okay.
Hey,
there

is,

Oh,
now
you
like
the
bird,
is
that
right?
Is
that
your
bird?
You
said
it
wasn't,
but
now
You
love
that
bird,
don't
you?
You
know
what?
Take
the
bird.
Take
his
pillows
too.
Both
of
them.
And
shoes,
take
his

I
took
your

How
does
that
make
you
feel?
Good.
Cause
that's
how
I
feel!
We
had
a

I

That
was
our
deal.

don't

really,
really

gonna

you're
gonna
make

Justin
Hammer,
his

will
begin
shortly
That's
what
I'm
talking
about!
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
country
has
had
to
place
its
brave
men
But
then
the
Iron
Man
arrived
the
days
of
losing
lives
were
behind
us.
Sadly
that
technology
was
kept
out
of
reach.
That's
not
fair.
That's
not
right.
-
And
it's
just
too
bad.
Regardless
it
was
an
impressive
innovation
Today,
my
friends,
the
press
They
are
about
to
run
out
of
ink.
Get
that
out
of

Ladies
and
gentlemen...

to
you

of
a

than

always
be

Tony,
there
are

I'm
here

Give
them
a

All
these
people
are
in
danger.

tried
that

working
with

Vanko
is
alive?

Where
is
he?
Where
is
Vanko?
-
Who?
What
are
you
doing
here,
man?
-
Is
that
you?
I
can't
move.
Get
out

Go!
Let's

happening?
What?

I
think
he
slaved
the
drones.
-
Call
the
guards

Then
call
their
cells.
-
He's
locked
us
out
of
the
mainframe.
Please,
please,
go
away.

Have
you
now?
In
fact,
if
your
guy
hadn't
showed
up
This
wouldn't
be
happening
Thank
you.

Fine.
You
want
me
to
drive?
Nice
work,
kid.
-
You
got
multiples
coming
down
on
you.
When
we
arrive
I
need
you
to
watch
the

I'm
gonna
enter

take
down

I'm
not
dying.

you're
not
dying?
Did
you
say
you're
dying?
No,
I'm
not.
Not
anymore.

What's
going
on?

You're
gonna

you
really
were
dying?

Why
didn't
you
tell
me
that?

Looks
like
the
fight's
coming
to
you.
-
Great.
Pepper?

I'm
fine.
Don't
be
mad.
I
will
formally...

I'm
not
fending
off

Hammeroid
attack!

We
could've
been
in
Venice.
Rhodes!
Snap

buddy!
They're
coming.
Come

roll.
Get
up.
Oh

you
okay?

I'm
sorry.

Alright.
You

I'll
draw
'em
in.

Okay

Where's
mine?

Rhodey...
Get
down!
Wow.
I
think
you
should
lead

sorry
boss,
I
can
only
use
it

told
you
that
five
minutes
ago.
That's
your

Excuse
me?
Hands
behind
your
back,
sir.
I'm
trying
to
help
here.
I
get
it.
I
see
what
you're
doing.
Trying
That's
good.
You
start
to
think
like
a
CEO.
I
like
that.
I'm
gonna
make
a
problem
for
you.
When
they
get
here,
I
think
you
should
station
them

We
got
this.
Rhodes!
I
got
an
idea.
You
wanna

Put
your
hand
up.

Yup.

him!
You
lose.

at
me!
My
body
literally
cannot
handle
the
stress.
or
wreck
the
whole
company...
I
think
I
did
okay!
I
quit.
That's
it.
What
did
you
just
say?
Surprising,
I
mean
not
I
get
it.
-
I'm
not
making
any
excuses.
I
wasn't
making
an
excuse
but
I'm
actually
very
justified.
You
deserve
better.
You've
taken
such
good
care
of
me.
I've
been
in
tough
spot
-
Right?
-
Yeah.
-
Let's
start
clean
up.
What
about
the
press?
-
With
you
it's
like
dog
years.
I
mean
it's
like
the
President.
Weird.
No
it's
not
weird.
-
It's
okay,
right?
I
think
it
was
weird.
You
guys
look
like
two
seals
fighting
over
a
grape.

I
had
just

Listen,

car
got
taken
out
