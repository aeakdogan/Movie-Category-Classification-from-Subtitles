Your

with

Pete.




(HEART
MONITOR


Why
have
you
been
fighting
Peter?
They
killed
a
little
frog
Smushed
it
with
a
stick.
You're
so
like
your
daddy.
You
even
look
like
him.
And
he
was
an
angel.
-
Composed
out
of
pure
light.
You
got
a
present
there
for
Peter,
Of
course.

There.
I've
got
you
covered,
Pete.
You
open
it
up
when
I'm
gone,
okay?
Your
grandpa...
...is
gonna
take
such
good
care
of
you.
At
least
until
your
daddy
Take
my
hand.
Peter.

Pete,
come
on.
Take
my
hand.

PETER:
Mom?
No!
No!
No!
No!
Mom!
No!
-
Come
with
me.

No!
You've
got
to
stay
here.
Please.
No...
Okay?

No.

Mom!






Drop
it!
Uh,
hey.

-
Drop
it,
now!
No
problem
at
all.
How
do
you
know
about
this?
PETER:
I
don't
even
know
what
that
is.
I'm
just
a
junker,
man.
You
don't
look
like
a
junker.
This
is
just
an
outfit,
man.
Ninja
Turtle,
you
better
stop
poking
me.
What
is
your
name?
My
name
is
Peter
Quill,
okay?
-
Move!
Ronan
may
have
questions
for
you.
PETER:
Hey,
you
know
what?
There's
another
name
Star-Lord.
Who?
Star-Lord,
man.
Legendary
outlaw.
-
Guys?
Ah,
forget
this.










WOMAN:
Peter?

What
happened?
Hey,
uh...
Uh...
I...
-
Bereet.
Look,
I'm
gonna
be
totally
honest

REPORTER
ON
TV:
Scattered
riots
broke
out
across
the
Kree
Empire
today
protesting
the
recent
peace
treaty
and
Xandar's
Nova
Prime.

Peter,
you
have
call.
-
No,
wait,
don't!
Hey,
Yondu.
I'm
here
on
Morag.
Ain't
no
Orb,
ain't
no
you.
Well,
I
was
in
the
neighborhood.
Well,
where
are
you
at
now,
boy?
I
feel
really
bad
about
this,
-
I
slaved
putting
this
deal
together.
Making
a
few
calls
is
"slaved"?
And
now
you're
gonna
rip
me
off!
We
do
not
do
that
to
each
other.
Yeah,
and
that
code
is
When
I
picked
you
up
on
Terra..
"Picked
me
up."
...these
boys
of
mine
Yeah?
They
ain't
never
tasted
I
stopped
them.
I
Will
find
you,
I
Will...

Put
a
bounty
on
him!
Forty
K.
-
But
I
want
him
back
alive.
-
Alive?
I
told
you
when
you
picked
that
kid
up,
you
should
have
delivered
him
He
was
cargo!
You
have
always
been
soft
on
him.
You're
the
only
one
I'm
being
soft
on!
Now,
don't
you
worry
about
Mr.
Quill.
As
soon
as
we
get
him
back
here,
I'm
gonna
kill
him
myself.
What
we
do
need
to
worry
about,
is
who
else
out
there
wants
that
Orb!
RONAN:
They
call
me
"terrorist,
"
"radical,
"
"zealot,
"
because
I
obey
the
ancient
laws
and
punish
those
who
do
not.
Because
I
do
not
forgive
your
people
for
taking
the
life
of
my
father,
and
his
father,
A
thousand
years
of
war
between
us
XANDARIAN:
You
can't
do
this!
RONAN:
My
government
You
Xandarians
and
your
culture
You
will
never
rule
Xandar.
No.
I
will
cure
it!

Ronan,
Korath
has
returned.
KORATH:
Master,
he
is
a
thief,
an
outlaw
who
calls
himself
Star-Lord.
But
we
have
discovered
to
retrieve
the
Orb
as
The
Broker.
I
promised
Thanos
Only
then
will
he
destroy
Xandar
for
me.
Nebula,
go
to
Xandar
It
will
be
my
honor.
It
will
be
your
doom.
If
this
happens
again,
without
his
prize.
I'm
a
daughter
of
Thanos.
Just
like
you.
But
I
know
Xandar.
Ronan
has
already
decreed
that
I...
Do
not
speak
for
me.
You
will
not
fail.
Have
I
ever?
ROCKET:
Xandarians.
What
a
bunch
of
losers.
All
of
them
in
a
big
hurry
to
nothing
at
all.
Pathetic.
Look
at
this
guy!
Can
you
believe
they
call
us
criminals,
when
he's
assaulting
us
What
is
this
thing?
It's
not
cool
to
get
help!
Look
at
Mr.
Smiles
over
here.
Where's
your
wife,
old
man?

Right,
Groot?
Groot?
Don't
drink
fountain
water,
you
idiot.
-
That's
disgusting!
Yes,
you
did.
I
just
saw
you
doing
it.
Why
are
you
lying?

Whoop.
Looks
like
we
got
one.
Okay,
humie,
how
bad
40,000
units?



-
Mr.
Quill.
The
Orb.
-
As
commissioned.
Wanted
to
be
here.
Sends
his
love.
And
told
me
to
tell
you,
that
you
got
the
best
eyebrows

What
is
it?
It's
my
policy
never
to
discuss
Yeah,
well,
I
almost
died
An
occupational
hazard,
Some
machine-headed
freak,
Ronan?
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Quill.
I
truly
am.
But
I
want
no
part
of
this
transaction
-
if
Ronan
is
involved.
Who's
Ronan?
A
Kree
fanatic,
who
will
not
rest
-
is
wiped
from
existence!
-
Come
on.
whose
bad
side
I'd
rather
not
be
on.
What?
What
about
my
bad
side?
Farewell,
Mr.
Quill.
Hey,
we
had
a
deal,
Bro!
What
happened?
Ah,
this
guy
just
backed
out
of
a
deal
If
there's
one
thing
I
hate,
Peter
Quill.
People
call
me
Star-Lord.
You
have
the
bearing
of
a
man
of
honor.
Well,
you
know,
I
wouldn't
say
that.
People
say
it
about
me,
all
the
time,
but
it's
not
something

Ooh!




This
wasn't
the
plan.
Ah!
ROCKET:
Put
him
in
the
bag.
No!
Not
her,
him!
Learn
genders,
man.

Ow!
Biting?
That's
not
fair!
ROCKET:
Take
it
easy!

Ow!


Fool.
You
should
have
learned.
I
don't
learn.
One
of
my
issues.

PETER:
What
the...
Quit
smiling,
you
idiot.

You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
Ooh.
Hey!



I
live
for
the
simple
things.
Like
how
much
this
is
gonna
hurt.


Yeah.
Writhe,
little
man.

It'll
grow
back,
you
d'ast
idiot.
Quit
whining.

Subject
89P13,
drop
your
weapon.
Aw,
crap.
By
the
authority
of
the
Nova
Corps,
-
you
are
under
arrest...
...for
endangerment
to
life
Hey!
If
it
isn't
Star-Prince.
-
Star-Lord.
I
picked
this
guy
up
a
while
back
He's
got
a
code
name.
OFFICER:
Yeah.
Stay
out
of
the
way.
Come
on,
man.
It's
a...
Just
relax,
pal.
It's
cool
to
have
a
code
name.
ROCKET:
Fascists.
NOVA
PRIME:
Ronan
is
destroying
Xandarian
outposts
I
should
think
that
would
call
for
some
We
signed
your
peace
treaty,
What
more
do
you
want?
At
least
a
statement
saying
that
they
condemn
his
actions.
He
is
slaughtering
children.
Families.
That
is
your
business.
Now,
I
have
other
matters
to
attend
to.
Prick.

well,
some
good
news.
It
looks
like
we've
apprehended
DEY:
Gamora.
Surgically

Recently,
Thanos

her

leads
us
to
believe
that

"Rocket."
The
result
of
illegal

What

Peter
Jason
Quill,
from
Terra.
Raised
from
youth
by
a
band
led
by
Yondu
Udonta.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
know
how
this
machine
worked.
What
a
bunch
of
a-holes.
SAAL:
Transport
all
four
to
the
Kyln.
ROCKET:
I
guess
most
of
Nova
Corps
but
these
ones
here,

I
ain't
gonna
be
here
long.
I've
escaped
22
prisons.
You're
lucky
the
broad
showed
up,
because
otherwise,
me
and
Groot
would
be
collecting
that
bounty
and
you'd
be
getting
by
Yondu
and
those
Ravagers.
I've
had
a
lot
of
folks
I
ain't
about
to
be
brought
down
Hold.
-
What's
a
raccoon?
It's
what
you
are,
stupid.
Ain't
no
thing
like
me,
except
me.
So,
this
Orb
has
Ark
of
the
Covenant,
-
What
is
it?
So
what?
What's
the
Orb?
I
have
no
words
for
an
honorless
thief.
Pretty
high
and
mighty
of
a
genocidal
maniac.
Yeah,
I
know
who
you
are.
Anyone
who's
anyone
Yeah,
we
know
who
you
are.
-
Who
is
she?
Yeah,
you
said
that.
I
wasn't
retrieving
the
Orb
for
Ronan.
I
was
betraying
him.
I
had
an
agreement
I
am
Groot.
Well,
that's
just
as
fascinating
What
is
wrong
with
Giving
Tree,
here?
Well,
he
don't
know
So
his
vocabulistics
is
limited
Exclusively

Hey.
Put
that

-
You
first!
You
first!
Coming
for
you
first,
Gamora!
You're
scum!
You're
scum!
It's
like
I
said,
she's
got
a
rep.
A
lot
of
prisoners
here
to
Ronan
and
his
goons.
She'll
last
a
day,
tops.
Murderer!
The
guards
will
protect
her,
right?
They're
here
to
stop
us
from
getting
out.
They
don't
care
Whatever
nightmares
the
future
holds,
are
dreams
Check
out
the
new
meat.
I'm
gonna
slather
you
up
and
go
to
town...

Let's
make
something
clear.
This
one
here
is
our
booty!
You
wanna
get
to
him,
you
go
through
us!
Or,
more
accurately,
we
go
through
you.


I'm
with
them.
INMATE:
I
hate
you.
No
cell's
gonna
protect
you
for
long.


You're
dead!
Dead!


GUARD:
Take
her
down
to
the
showers.
It'll
be
easier
to
clean
up

Quill,
where
you
going?
Quill.
Quill!
Gamora,
consider
this
a
death
sentence
for
your
crimes
against
the
galaxy.
DRAX:
You
dare?
You
know
who
I
am,
yes?
PRISONER:
You're
Drax.
The
Destroyer.
Quill!
DRAX:
And
you
know
You
slayed
dozens
of
Ronan's
minions.
Ronan
murdered
my
wife,
Ovette,
and
my
daughter,
Camaria.
He
slaughtered
them
where
they
stood.
And
he
laughed!
ROCKET:
Quill?
DRAX:
Her
life
is
not
yours
to
take.
He
killed
my
family.
I
shall
kill
one
of
his
in
return.
Of
course,
Drax.
Here,
I...



I'm
no
family
to
Ronan
or
Thanos.

I'm
your
only
hope
at
stopping
him.

Ah!
Woman,
your
words
-
Hey!
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Hey!
You
know,
if
killing
Ronan
I
don't
think
this
is
Are
you
not
the
man
Well,
I
mean,
to
try
and
do
that
to
me.

Look,
this
is
from
Stabbed
me
with
a
fork.
Didn't
like
me
skipping
out
on
her
I
got,
right
here,
a
Kree
girl
She
caught
me
with
who
worked
in
Nova
Records.
I
was
trying
to
get
information.
You
ever
see
an
A'askavariian?
They
have
tentacles,
If
you
think
I'm
seriously
interested
You
don't
care.
But
here's
the
point.
She
betrayed
Ronan.
And
when
he
does,
that's
when
you...
Why
would
I
put
What?
Oh,
no,
it's
a
symbol.
This
is
a
symbol
I
would
not
slice
his
throat.
I
would
cut
his
head
clean
off.
It's
a
general
expression
You've
heard
of
this.
-
You
know
what
that
is.
-
Everyone
knows.
What
I'm
saying
is,
Don't
do
his
work
for
him.

I
like
your
knife.
I'm
keeping
it.
-
That
was
my
favorite
knife.
I
could
care
less
-
Then
why
stop
the
big
guy?
You
know
where
to
sell
my
Orb.
How
are
we
gonna
sell
it
My
friend
Rocket,
here,
has
escaped
22
prisons.
Oh,
we're
getting
out.
And
then
we're
headed
straight
How
much
was
your
buyer
Four
billion
units.
-
What?
That
Orb
is
my
opportunity
to
If
you
free
us,
I'll
lead
you
to
the
buyer
directly
and
I'll
split
the
profit
I
am
Groot.
ROCKET:
Four
of
us.
Asleep
for
the
danger,
as
per
frickin'
usual.

You
have
been
betrayed,
Ronan.
We
know
only
that
Gamora
may
yet
recover
the
Orb.
No!
Our
sources
within
the
Kyln
say
Look,
your
partnership
with
Thanos
is
at
risk.
Thanos
requires
your
presence.
Now!
RONAN:
With
all
due
respect,
Thanos,
and
yet
you
summon
me.
I
would
lower
my
voice,
Accuser.
First,
she
lost
a
battle
Thanos
put
Gamora
under
your
charge.
RONAN:
Then
she
was
apprehended
You
are
the
one
here
Your
sources
say
that
she
meant
Lower
your
tone!
I
may
be
your...
I
only
ask
that
you
take
The
only
matter
is
you.
Your
politics
bore
me.
Your
demeanor
is
that
of
a
pouty
child.
And,
apparently,
you
alienated
I
shall
honor
our
agreement,
Kree,
if
you
bring
me
the
Orb.
But
return
to
me
again
empty-handed,
and
I
will
bathe
the
starways
Thanks,
Dad.
Sounds
fair.
This
is
one
fight
you
won't
win.
Let's
head
to
the
Kyln.
ROCKET:
If
we're
gonna
get
out
of
here,
we're
gonna
need
to
And
to
do
that,
The
guards
wear
security
bands
to
control
their
ins
and
outs.
I
need
one.
Leave
it
to
me.
ROCKET:
That
dude,
there.
PETER:
His
leg?
God
knows
I
don't
need
the
rest
of
him.
All
right.
And
finally,
on
the
wall
back
there
-
Do
you
see
it?
There's
a
quarnyx
battery
behind
it.
To
get
into
that
watchtower,
How
are
we
supposed
to
do
that?
Well,
supposably,
So,
maybe
you
can
work
out
You
must
be
joking.
No,
I
really
heard
Look,
it's
20
feet
up
in
the
air,
and
it's
in
the
middle
of
the
most
It's
impossible
to
get
up
there
I
got
one
plan,
and
that
plan
requires
so
figure
it
out!
Oh!
Can
I
get
back
to
it?
Thanks.
Now,
this
is
important.
Once
the
battery
is
removed,
everything
is
gonna
slam
Once
we
have
it,
we
gotta
move
quickly,
so
you
definitely
need
to
get
that
last.

Or
we
could
just
get
it
first
-
I'll
get
the
armband.

GUARD:
Prisoner,
drop
the
device
immediately
or
we
will
open
fire.

I
am
Groot!
Fire!

All
prisoners
return

You
idiot!
How
am
I
supposed
to
fight
The
animal
is
in
control.
Fire
on
my
command!

Creepy
little
beast!

Oh,
yeah.


You
need
my
what?

-
I'll
need
this.
It's
internally
wired.
I'll
figure
something
out.


Drop
the
leg!
Drop
the
leg

GAMORA:
Rocket!
Move
to
the
watchtower!



You!
Man
who
has
lain
with
an
A'askavariian!
It
was
one
time,
man.
We
need
all
available
guards

Whoa!

Spare
me
your
foul
gaze,
woman.
Why
is
this
one
here?
We
promised
him
he
could
stay
I
always
keep
my
promises,
when
they're
who
will
kill
me
if
I
don't.
Here
you
go.
Oh,
I
was
just
kidding
about
the
leg.
I
just
need
these
two
things.
-
What?
Was
it
funny?
Oh,
wait,
what
did
he
look
like
I
had
to
transfer
him
30,000
units!

DRAX:
How
are
we
going
to
leave?
Well,
he's
got
a
plan.
Right?
Or
is
that
I
have
a
plan!
I
have
a
plan!
Cease
your
yammering
and
relieve
us
Yeah,
I'll
have
to
agree
on
that
one.
Do
not
ever
call
me
a
thesaurus.
It's
just
a
metaphor,
dude.
His
people
are
completely
literal.
Nothing
goes
over
my
head.
My
reflexes
are
too
fast.
I
would
catch
it.
I'm
gonna
die
surrounded
by
Those
are
some
big
guns.
On
my
command!
Number
one!
Rodent,
we
are
ready
for
your
plan.
Hold
on!
Number
two!
I
recognize
this
animal.
We'd
roast
them
over
a
flame
pit
Their
flesh
was
quite
delicious.
Not
helping!
Number
three!

All
fire
on
my
command!
Three!
Two!
One!

GAMORA:
He
turned
off
the
artificial
gravity,
everywhere
but
in
here.


I
told
you
I
had
a
plan.


That
was
a
pretty
good
plan.
Huh?
Yeah!
There
it
is.
Get
my
ship.
It's
the
Milano,
the
orange
and
blue
one
They
crumpled
my
pants
up
into
a
ball.
That's
rude!
They
folded
yours.
The
Orb's
there.
Let's
go.
-
Wait,
wait,
wait.
That
bastard
didn't
put
it
back.
-
Put
what
back?
Get
them
to
the
ship.
I
will
be
right
back.
-
How
are
you
gonna
possibly...
Go.
Go!





Ah,
my
neck!

ROCKET:
Well,
GAMORA:
He
declined
to
share
Well,
screw
this,
then!
I
ain't
waiting
around
You
got
the
Orb,
right?
Yes.
(POP
SONG

If
we
don't
leave
now,
No!
We're
not
leaving
without
the
Orb.
Behold.
This
one
shows
spirit.
He
shall
make
a
keen
ally
Companion,
what
were
you
retrieving?


You're
an
imbecile.

PETER:
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Yo,
Ranger
Rick!
What
are
you
doing?
You
can't
take
apart
my
ship
-
See,
what
is
this?
It's
a
bomb.
-
A
bomb?
And
you
leave
it
lying
around?
I
was
gonna
put
it
in
a
box.
What's
a
box
gonna
do?
-
How
about
this
one?
-
Leave
it
alone.
-
Shut
up.

What
is
that?
That's
for
if
things
get
really
hardcore.
Or
if
you
wanna
blow
up
moons.
No
one's
blowing
up
moons.
You
just
wanna
suck
the
joy
So,
listen,
I'm
gonna
need
We're
heading
in
the
right
direction.
If
we're
gonna
work
together,
And
how
much
do
you
trust
me?
I'd
trust
you
a
lot
more
Because
I'm
guessing
I
don't
know
what
it
is.
If
it's
a
weapon,
Put
it
down,
you
fool.
Or
just
you,
murderess!
I
let
you
live
once,
princess!
-
I
am
not
a
princess!
Nobody
is
killing
anybody
on
my
ship!
We're
stuck
together
I
have
no
interest
in
money.
Great.
That
means
more
money

Mmm?

For
the
four
of
us.
Partners.
We
have
an
agreement,
but
I
would
never
be
partners
I'll
tell
the
buyer
we're
on
our
way.
And
Quill,
your
ship
is
filthy.
Oh,
she
has
no
idea.
If
I
had
a
black
light,
the
place
would
look
like
You
got
issues,
Quill.

GUARD:
I
swear.
NEBULA:
If
he
knew
he
would
have
already
told
us.
Yeah.
Ronan,
the
Nova
Corps
sent
a
fleet
Well,
then,
send
Necrocraft
Find
the
Orb.
Any
means,
any
price.
And
this
place?
The
Nova
can't
know
what
we're
after.

Cleanse
it!
Do
you
got
any
other
I
like
to
stick
'em
all
in
a
row
I
can't
tell
if
you're
joking
or
not.
He's
being
fully
serious.
In
that
case,
I
can
show
you...
But
first,
you
gonna
tell
me
and
why
everybody
cares
And
then
you
gonna
tell
me,
who
out
there
might
wanna
buy
it.
Sir,
the
high-end
community
is
a...

The
high-end
community
is
a...
It's
a
tight-knit...
Tight-knit...
The
high-end
community

I
cannot
possibly
betray
the
confidentiality
of
my
buyers!


Now,
who
again
is
this
buyer
of
yours?
TIVAN:
Carina.
Yes,
Master.
TIVAN:
Your
people
do
have
elbows,
We
do,
Master.
TIVAN:
Then
use
them.
I
don't
have
to
remind
you
what
happened
to
the
last
attendant
Do
I?
Chop,
chop.

ROCKET:
Heads
up!
We're
inbound.
Whoa.
What
is
it?
GAMORA:
It's
called
Knowhere.
The
severed
head
Be
wary
headed
in,
rodent.
There
are
no
regulations
GAMORA:

of
years
ago,

Bone,

spinal

All
rare
resources,
highly
valued
It's
dangerous
and
illegal
work,
Well,
I
come
from
a
planet
of
outlaws.
Billy
the
Kid,
Bonnie
and
Clyde,
John
Stamos.
It
sounds
like
a
place,
Yeah,
you
should.
KID:
Excuse
me.
-
Watch
your
wallets.
PETER:
Get
out
of
here.
Your
buyer's
in
there?
We
are
to
wait
here
BOUNCER:
Get
out
of
here!
This
is
no
respectable
establishment.
What
do
you
expect
us
to
do

Yes!
Yes!
Whoa!

Yahoo!


My
Orloni
has
won,
as
I
won
at
all
things!
Now,
let's
put
more
of
this
liquid
That's
the
first
thing
you
said
Man,
you
wouldn't
believe
I
might
actually
lose
money
on
this
job.
GAMORA:
My
connection
is
making
us
wait.
It's
just
a
negotiation
tactic.
Where
yours
is
more,
"Stab,
stab.
Those
are
my
terms."
My
father
didn't
stress
diplomacy.
Thanos?
He's
not
my
father.
When
Thanos
took
my
home
world,
he
killed
my
parents
in
front
of
me.
He
tortured
me,
turned
me
into
a
weapon.
When
he
said
he
was
going
to
destroy
I
couldn't
stand
by
and...
Why
would
you
risk
your
life
for
this?

My
mother
gave
it
to
me.
My
mom
liked
sharing
with
me
all
the
I
happened
to
have
it
on
me,
when
I
was...
The
day
that
she...
You
know,
when
I
left
Earth.
GAMORA:
What
do
you
do
with
it?
Do?
Nothing.
You
listen
to
it.
I'm
a
warrior
and
an
assassin.
Really?
On
my
planet,
It's
called
Footloose.
And
in

people
use.


The
melody
is
pleasant!
-
No!
I
know
who
you
are,
Peter
Quill!
And
I
am
not
some
starry-eyed
waif
Your
pelvic
sorcery!
That
is
not
what
is
happening
here.

Oh,
no.



Stop
it!
Whoa,
whoa,
what
are
you
doing?
This
vermin
speaks
of
affairs
-
That
is
true!
-
That
is
also
true!
ROCKET:
Keep
calling
me
You
just
wanna
laugh
at
me
Rocket,
you're
drunk.
All
right?
He
thinks
I'm
some
stupid
thing!
Well,
I
didn't
ask
to
get
made!
I
didn't
ask
to
be
torn
apart,
and
put
back
together,
over
and
over
and
turned
into
some...

Some
little
monster!
Rocket,
no
one's
calling
you
a
monster.
He
called
me
"vermin"!
She
called
me
"rodent"!
Let's
see
if
you
can
laugh
after
five
or
six
good
shots

No,
no,
no,
no!
Four
billion
units!
Rocket!
Come
on,
man.
Hey!
Suck
it
up
for
one
more
lousy
night
and
you're
rich.
Fine.
But
I
can't
promise,
when
all
this
is
over
I'm
not
gonna
kill
See?
That's
exactly
why
Five
seconds
after
you
meet
somebody,
We
have
travelled,
And
Ronan
is
no
closer
to
being
dead.
-
Drax!
We
don't
need
him.
CARINA:
Milady
Gamora.
I'm
here
to
fetch
you
for
my
master.
Okay,
this
isn't
creepy
at
all.
We
house
the
galaxy's
of
fauna,
relics,


I
present
to
you,
Taneleer
Tivan,
The
Collector.
Oh,
my
dear
Gamora.
How
wonderful
to
meet
in
the
flesh.
Let's
bypass
the
formalities,
Tivan.
We
have
what
we
discussed.
What
is
that
thing
there?
I
am
Groot.
TIVAN:
I
never
thought
I'd
meet
a
Groot.
Sir...
You
must
allow
me
to
pay
you
now
At
the
moment
of
your
death,
of
course.
I
am
Groot.
Why,
so
he
could
turn
you
That's
your
pet?
-
His
what?
We
have
been
halfway
Very
well,
then.
Let
us
see
what
you
brought.
DISPATCHER:
Three
quarnyx
batteries,
No,
cases.
Last
time,
you
sent
me...
Uh...
You
shall
send
a
message
for
me.
Oh,
my
new
friends.
Before
creation
itself,
there
were
six
singularities.
Then
the
universe
exploded
and
the
remnants
of
these
systems
were
forged
into
concentrated
ingots.

Infinity
Stones.
These
stones,
it
seems,
can
only
be
brandished
by
beings
of
extraordinary
strength.
Observe.
These
carriers
can
use
the
Stone
like
wheat
in
a
field.
There's
a
little
pee
Once,
for
a
moment,
a
group
was
able
to
share
but
even
they
Beautiful.
Beyond
compare.
Blah,
blah,
blah.
We're
all
very
fascinated,
whitey.
TIVAN:
How
would
you
like
to
get
paid?
ROCKET:
What
do
you
think,
TIVAN:
Very
well,
then.
Carina.
Stand
back.
I
will
no
longer
be
your
slave!
No!




What
the...

How
could
I
think
Tivan
could
contain
What
do
you
still
have
it
for?
PETER:
What
are
we
gonna
do,
I
can't
believe
you
had
that
It's
not
a
purse,
it's
a
knapsack!
We
have
to
bring
this
There's
a
chance
they
can
contain
it.
ROCKET:
Are
you
kidding
me?
We're
wanted
by
the
Nova
Corps.
So
he
can
destroy
the
galaxy?
What
are
you,
What
has
the
galaxy
ever
done
for
you?
Because
I'm
one
of
the
idiots
Peter,
listen
to
me.
We
cannot
allow
the
Stone
We
have
to
go
back
to
your
ship,
and
deliver
it
to
Nova.
Right,
right,
okay.
I
think
you're
right.
Or
we
could
give
it
to
somebody
who's
really
nice
for
a
whole
lot
of
money.
I
think
it's
a
really
good
balance
You're
despicable.
Dishonorable.
Faithless!
-
Oh,
no.

I
shall
meet
my
foe
and
destroy
him.
You
called
Ronan?
YONDU:
Quill!
Don't
you
move,
boy!
Don't
you
move!
Get
out
of
the
way!
Ronan
the
Accuser!
You
are
the
one
DRAX:
You
killed
my
wife.
You
killed
my
daughter!
I
told
you,
you
can't
fit.
It
is
Gamora.

No!
RONAN:
Nebula,
retrieve
the
Orb.
NEBULA:
The
Stone
Bring
it
down!
Ah!

Rocket,
keep
them
off
Gamora
How?
We've
got
These
pods
are
industrial
grade.
They're
nearly
indestructible.
Not
against
necroblasts,
they're
not.
That's
not
what
I'm
saying.
Oh!



PETER:
Let
me
borrow
your
ride.



I
don't
recall
killing
your
family.
I
doubt
I'll
remember
killing
you,
either.

Quill,
I'm
trapped.
I
have
to
head
out.
Wait!
These
things
You
are
a
disappointment,
sister.
Of
all
our
siblings,
I
hated
you
least.
GAMORA:
Nebula,
please.
If
Ronan
gets
this
stone
-
he'll
kill
us
all.
You
will
already
be
dead.
NEBULA:
Ronan,
it
is
done.
ROCKET:
Quill,
come
on.
Her
body
mods
should
keep
her
alive
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
for
her.
These
pods
In
a
second,
we're
gonna
be
Aw,
damn
it.
ROCKET:
Quill?
Yondu!
Yondu.
This
is
Quill!
-
My
coordinates
are
227K324.
Quill,
what
are
you
doing?
Just
outside
Knowhere.
If
you're
there,
come
get
me.
I'm
all
yours.
ROCKET:
Quill,
don't
be
ridiculous.
Get
back
into
your
pod!
You
can't
fit
two
people
in
there.
You'll
die
in
seconds!
Quill.




Quill?
What
happened?
I
saw
you
out
there.
I
don't
know
what
came
over
me.
But
I
couldn't
let
you
die.
I
found
something
inside
of
myself.
Something
incredibly
heroic.
I
mean,
not
to
brag,
but,
objectively...
Where's
the
Orb?
It's...
Well,
they
got
the
Orb.
What?
Welcome
home,
Peter.


Blasted
idiot.
They're
all
idiots!

Quill
just
got
himself
captured.
None
of
this
ever
would
have
happened
take
on
a
frickin'
army!

You're
right.
I
was
a
fool.
All
the
anger,
all
the
rage,
was
just
to
cover
my
loss.

Oh,
boo-hoo-hoo.

Oh,
I
don't
care
if
it's
mean!
Everybody's
got
dead
people.
It's
no
excuse
to
get
everybody
else
dead
along
the
way!
Come
on,
Groot.
Ronan
has
the
Stone.
The
only
chance
we
got
is
as
fast
as
we
can
and
maybe,
just
maybe,
we'll
be
able
to
live
full
lives
I
am
Groot.
Save
them?
How?
I
am
Groot.
I
know
they're
the
only
friends
but
there's
an
army
And
there's
only
two
of
us!
Three.

Aw!
You're
making
me
beat...
up
grass!
RONAN:
The
Orb
is
in
my
possession,
as
I
promised.
Bring
it
to
me.
Yes,
that
was
our
agreement.
Bring
you
the
Orb,
and
you
will
destroy
Xandar
for
me.
However,
now
that
I
know
I
wonder
what
use
I
have
for
you.
Boy,
I
would
reconsider
your
current
course.
Master!
You
cannot!
Thanos
is
the
most
powerful
being
Not
anymore.
You
call
me
"boy!"
I
will
unfurl
1,000
years
of
Kree
justice
and
burn
it
to
its
core!
Then,
Thanos,
I
am
coming
for
you.
After
Xandar,
You
dare
to
oppose
me?
You
see
what
he
has
turned
me
into.
If
you
kill
him,
I
will
help
you
YONDU:
You
betray
me?
Steal
my
money?
Stop
it!
Leave
him
alone!
When
I
picked
you
up
as
a
kid,
these
boys
wanted
to
eat
you.
They
ain't
never
tasted
Terran
before.
I
saved
your
life!
Oh,
will
you
shut
up
about
that?
God!
Twenty
years,
you
been
like
it's
some
great
thing,
not
eating
me.
Normal
people
don't
even
think
Much
less
that
person
You
abducted
me,
man.
You
stole
me
from
my
home
You
don't
give
a
damn
You're
scared
because
you're
soft
in
here.
Here,
right
here!
GAMORA:
Yondu!
Listen
to
me.
Ronan
has
something
I
know
what
he's
got,
girl.
Then
you
know
we
must
get
it
back!
He's
gonna
use
it
to
wipe
out
Xandar.
We
have
to
warn
them.
Is
that
what
she's
been
Sentiment?
Eating
away
your
brain
like
maggots!
That's
it.

No!
Sorry,
boy.
But
a
captain's
gotta
teach
his
men
Captain's
gotta
teach
stuff!

If
you
kill
me
now,
you
are
saying
goodbye
to
The
Stone?
I
hope
you
got
something
Because
ain't
nobody
stealing
We
got
a
ringer.
Is
that
right?
She
knows
everything
His
ships,
his
army.
He's
vulnerable.
Hey,
what
do
you
say,
Yondu,
huh?
Me
and
you,
taking
down
a
mark



Let
him
go!

You
always
did
have
a
scrote,
boy!
That's
why
I
kept
you
on
as
a
young'un.


Captain,
the
shot
was
non-damaging.
ROCKET:
Attention,
idiots.
The
lunatic
on
top
of
this
craft
It's
a
weapon
of
my
own
design.
What
the
hell?
If
you
don't
hand
over
he's
gonna
tear
your
ship
a
new
one.
A
very
big
new
one!
-
I
ain't
buyin'
it.
-
5,
4,
3...
Rocket,
it's
me,
for
God
sakes!
We
figured
it
out!
We're
fine!
ROCKET:
Oh,
hey,
Quill.
You
call
that
"figured
it
out"?
We're
gonna
rob
the
guys
Oh,
you
want
to
talk
about
senseless?
How
about
trying
to
save
us
We
were
only
gonna
blow
you
up
And
how
on
earth
when
you
only
gave
them
We
didn't
have
time
of
the
plan.
This
is
what
we
get
-
I
am
Groot.
What's
important
now
is
we
get
the
Ravagers'
army
to
help
us
save
Xandar.
So
we
can
give
the
Stone
to
Yondu
who's
just
gonna
sell
We'll
figure
that
part
out
later.
We
have
to
stop
Ronan.
How?
I
have
a
plan.
You've
got
a
plan?
Yes.
First
of
all,
you're
copying
me
from
-
when
I
said
I
had
a
plan.
People
say
that
all
the
time.
Secondly,
I
don't
even
I
have
part
of
a
plan!
What
percentage
of
a
plan
You
don't
get
to
ask
questions
after
the
nonsense
I
just
saved
Quill.
We've
already
established
that
you
destroying
the
ship
-
When
did
we
establish
it?
I
wasn't
listening.

She's
right.
You
don't
get
an
opinion.
What
percentage?
I
don't
know.
Twelve
percent.
Twelve
percent?

That's
a
fake
laugh.
-
It's
real!
That
is
the
most
real,
authentic,
because
that
is
not
a
plan.
It's
barely
a
concept.
You're
taking
their
side?
I
am
Groot.
So
what,
it's
better
than
11%?
What
the
hell
does
that
Thank
you,
Groot.
Thank
you.
See?
Groot's
the
only
one
of
you


Guys.
Come
on.
Yondu
is
gonna
be
here
in
two
seconds.
He
expects
to
hear
this
big
plan
of
ours.
I
need
your
help.
I
look
around
at
us.
You
know
what
I
see?
Losers.
I
mean,
like,
folks
who
have
lost
stuff.
And
we
have.
Man,
we
have.
All
of
us.
Our
homes,
our
families,
normal
lives.
And,
usually,
life
takes
more
Today,
it's
given
us
something.
It
has
given
us
a
chance.
To
do
what?
To
give
a
shit.
For
once.
Not
run
away.
I,
for
one,
am
not
gonna
as
Ronan
wipes
out
But,
Quill,
stopping
Ronan,
it's
impossible.
You're
asking
us
to
die.

Yeah,
I
guess
I
am.

GAMORA:
Quill.
I
have
lived
most
my
life
I
will
be
grateful
You
are
an
honorable
man,
Quill.
I
will
fight
beside
you.
And
in
the
end,
I
will
see
my
wife
and
daughter
again.
I
am
Groot.

Oh,
what
the
hell.
Now
I'm
standing.
Y'all
happy?
We're
all
standing
up
now.
Bunch
of
jackasses,


GAMORA:
The
Stone
reacts
The
bigger
the
target,
All
Ronan's
got
to
do
is
touch
the
Stone
All
plants,
animals,
-
Nova
Corps.
So
Ronan
does
not
make
the
surface.

PETER:
Rocket
will
lead
a
team
in
the
Dark
Aster's
starboard
hull.
Then,
our
craft
and
Yondu's
will
enter.
Won't
there
be
I
think
of
Sakaaran
as
paper
people.
Once
they
know
we're
on
board,
Ronan
will
isolate
himself
behind
Which
I
can
disable
PETER:
We'll
make
it
to
the
flight
deck,
and
I'll
use
the
Hadron
Enforcer
Once
Ronan
is
dead,
Use
these
devices
to
contain
it.
If
you
touch
it,
it
will
kill
you.
PETER:
I'll
contact
who
arrested
us.
Hopefully,
they'll
believe
There's
one
more
thing
That
guy's
eye.
No!
No,
we
don't.
No,
we
don't
need
that
guy's
eye.
No,
seriously,
I
need
it!
AUTOMATED
VOICE:
Ronan's
fleet
has
been
spotted,
and
will
arrive
in
T-minus
fifteen
minutes.
Remember,
boy.
At
the
end
of
all
this,
I
get
the
Stone.
You
cross
me,
we
kill
you
all.

Let's
go
get
'em,
boys!
This
is
a
terrible
plan.
Hey,
you're
the
one
who
said
Nova
Prime.
I
received
a
transmission
from
one
of
the
Ravagers.
He
says
Ronan's
in
possession
of
and
he's
headed
toward
Xandar.
Good
God.
It's
a
trick.
He's
a
criminal.
NOVA
PRIME:
Did
he
say
He
said
his
crew
so
he'd
have
no
other
reason
He
says
that
he's
an
"a-hole."
But
he's
not,
and
I'm
quoting
him,
here,
"100%
a
dick."
Do
you
believe
him?
I
don't
know
that
I
believe
anyone
I
mean,
do
you
believe
Yeah.
A
fleet
approaches.
They
appear
to
be
Ravagers.

Fire!
YONDU:
Cover
it
down.
Submerge!
Rocket,
hurry!
All
pilots,
dive!
They're
beneath
us!
NOVA
PRIME:
Evacuate
the
city.
Our
priority
is
to
get
our
people
Forward
thrust,
now!

Come
on!
Quill!
Yondu!
Now!
YONDU:
Aw,
hell!
I'm
going
down,
Quill!
No
more
games
with
me,
boy!
I'll
see
you
at
the
end
of
this!
There
are
too
many
of
them,
Rocket!
We'll
never
make
it
up
there!
SAAL:
Peter
Quill.
This
is
Denarian
Saal
For
the
record,
They
got
my
"dick"
message!
Prove
me
wrong.

Yes!

Yes!

We're
just
like
Kevin
Bacon.

The
starboard
kern
has
been
breached!
We
have
been
boarded.
Continue
our
approach.
But
the
Nova
Corps
have
engaged.
None
of
that
will
matter
Seal
security
doors!
Now!

NEBULA:
Get
out
of
my
way!
Oh,
man.
All
Nova
pilots,
The
Dark
Aster

NOVA
CORPS
PILOT
1:
Locked
in!
NOVA
CORPS
PILOT
2:
Locked
in.
We're
locked
in.
I
can
barely
see.
When
did
you
learn
to
do
that?
Pretty
sure
the
answer
is
"I
am
Groot."
The
flight
deck
is
300
meters
this
way.
I
want
you
all
to
know
that
I
am
grateful
It
is
pleasing
to
once
again
have
friends.
You,
Quill,
are
my
friend.
Thanks.
-
This
dumb
tree,
he
is
my
friend.
And
this
green
whore,
she,
too...
Oh,
you
must
stop!

Gamora,
look
at
what
you
have
done.
You
have
always
been
weak.
You
stupid,
traitorous...
Nobody
talks
to
my
friends
like
that.
Head
to
the
flight
deck.
I'll
shut
down
the
power

GUARD:
Yondu
Udonta.
Order
your
men

Enough
nonsense,
Ravager!
Time
to
die...





Nebula,
please.



Enough
of
this.
Necrocraft
pilots,
enact
immolation
initiative.
STARBLASTER
PILOT:
They're
dive-bombing
the
city!
Denarian
Saal,
No!
Hold
your
positions.


Keep
Ronan
up
there,
Saal.
We'll
take
care
of
the
people
I
can't
believe
Star-Lord.
Finally.

Ah!
You
thief!


You
will
never
make
it
to
Ronan.
Everybody
shoot
them
Come
on!




Finger
to
the
throat
means
death.

Metaphor.
Yeah,
sorta.
Oh,
no.


RONAN:
Xandar!
You
stand
accused.
Your
wretched
peace
treaty
will
not
save
you
now.
It
is
the
tinder
on
which
you
burn.

Rocket!
Hold
on,
Saal,
just...

Quill,
you
gotta
hurry.
The
city's
been
evacuated,
but
we're
getting
our
asses
Gamora
hasn't
opened
the
door!



GAMORA:
Nebula!
Sister,
help
us
fight
Ronan.
You
know
he's
crazy.
I
know
you're
both
crazy.
No!
-
What
the...?
NEBULA:
Get
out!

You
did
it!


I
was
mistaken.
I
do
remember
your
family.
Their
screams
were
pitiful.
I...





No,
Groot!
You
can't.
You'll
die.
Why
are
you
doing
this?
Why?
We
are
Groot.



I
called
him
an
idiot.

You
killed
Groot!

Behold!
Your
guardians
of
the
galaxy.
What
fruit
have
they
wrought?
Only
that
my
father
and
his
father
shall
finally
know
vengeance.
People
of
Xandar,
the
time
has
come
to
rejoice
and
renounce
your
paltry
gods!
Your
salvation
is
at
hand.

(PETER
SINGING
ALONG
Listen
to
these
words.

Now
bring
it
down
hard!
What
are
you
doing?
Dance-off,
Bro.
Me
and
you.

Gamora.
Subtle.
Take
it
back.
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
distracting
you,

No!

Peter!
Take
my
hand!
Take
my
hand,
Peter.
Mom.
GAMORA:
Take
my
hand!
You're
mortal!
How?
You
said
it
yourself,
bitch.
We're
the
Guardians
of
the
Galaxy.


YONDU:
Well,
well,
well.
Quite
the
light
show.

Ain't
this
sweet.

But
you
got
some
business
to
attend
to
before
all
the
nookie-nookie
starts.
Peter,
you
can't.
Peter.
You
gotta
reconsider
this,
Yondu.
I
don't
know
who
you're
selling
this
to,
but
the
only
way
is
if
you
give
it
to
the
Nova
Corps.
I
may
be
as
pretty
as
an
angel,
but
I
sure
as
hell
ain't
one.
Hand
it
over,
son.

Yondu.
Do
not
open
that
Orb.
You've
seen
what
it
does
to
people.

Yeah,
Quill
turned
out
okay.
It's
probably
good
like
we
was
hired
to
do.
Yeah,
that
guy
was
a
jackass.
He
is
gonna
be
so
pissed
when
he

He
was
gonna
kill
you,
Peter.
Oh,
I
know.
But
he
was
about
the
only
family
I
had.
No.
He
wasn't.







PETER:
Why
would
you
DEY:
When
we
arrested
you,
we
noticed
so
we
had
it
checked
out.
I'm
not
Terran?
NOVA
PRIME:
You
are
half
Terran.
Your
mother
was
of
Earth.
he's
something
very
ancient
That
could
be
why
you
were
able
to
hold
the
Stone
for
as
long
as
you
did.

On
behalf
of
the
Nova
Corps,
we'd
like
to
express
for
your
help
in
saving
Xandar.
If
you
will
follow
Denarian
Dey,
he
has
something
to
show
you.
Thank
you,
Nova
Prime.
Your
wife
and
child
shall
rest
well
Yes.
Of
course,
Ronan
was
only
a
puppet.
It's
really
Thanos
I
need
to
kill.
We
tried
to
keep
it
as
close
We
salvaged
as
much
as
we
could.
Wow.
I...
Thank
you.
I
have
a
family.
They're
alive
because
of
you.
Your
criminal
records
However,
I
have
to
warn
you
against
ROCKET:
Question.
What
if
I
see
something
and
it
belongs
to
someone
else?
DEY:
You
will
be
arrested.
But
what
if
I
want
it
more
-
It's
still
illegal.
No,
I
want
it
more,
sir.
What
are
you
laughing
at?
Why?
I
can't
have
a
discussion
What
if
someone
and
I
decide
to
remove
his
spine?
That's...
That's
actually
murder.
It's
one
of
the
worst
crimes
of
all.
So...
also
illegal.
Hmm.
They'll
be
fine,
Dey.
I'm
gonna
keep
an
eye
on
'em.
You?
Yeah.
Me.

MEREDITH:
Peter,
I
know
these
last
few
months
But
I'm
going
to
a
better
place.
And
I
will
be
okay.
And
I
will
always
be
with
you.
You
are
the
light
of
my
life.
My
precious
son.
My
little
Star-Lord.
Love,
Mom.





PETER:
So,
what
should
we
do
next?
Something
good?
Something
bad?
A
bit
of
both?
We'll
follow
your
lead,
Star-Lord.
Bit
of
both.


HOWARD:
What
do
you
let
it
Gross.

Yeah!
But
it
burns
going
down.
