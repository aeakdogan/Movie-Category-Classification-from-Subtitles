It's
me,
Peter
Parker.
Your
friendly
neighborhood...
you
know.
I've
come
a
long
way
from
being
the
boy
who
was
bit
by
a
spider.
Back
then,
nothing
seemed
to
go
right
for
me.
-
Now...
people
really
like
me.
-
Hey,
stick
around!
It's
gonna
start
again
in
a
couple
minutes.
The
city
is
safe
and
sound.
Guess
I've
had
something
to
do
with
that.
My
uncle
Ben
would
be
proud.
WHY
NY
<3'S
SPIDEY
I
still
go
to
school,
Now,
the
Hamiltonian
shows
us
that
the
energy
levels
are
perturbed
by
the
electric
field.
From
the
form
of
this
matrix,
we
can
see...?
-
Miss
Stacey?
Correct!
Good
work,
Miss
Stacey.
Parker.
You
got
something
to
add?
No,
sir.
And
I'm
in
love
with
the
girl
of
my
dreams.
Hi.
Um,
Miss
Watson
left
a
ticket
for
me?
Peter
Parker.
Excuse
me.
Sorry.
Thank
you.
It's
my
girlfriend!
Harry!
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Explain
things.
Tell
it
to
my
father.
Raise
him
from
the
dead.
I'm
your
friend,
Harry.
I
cared
about
your
father.
MJ.
Peter.
-
Was
I
good?
-
You
were
great.
You
were...
I
love
my
flowers.
They're
beautiful.
And
those
are
from
Harry.
Was
he
here
tonight?
What's
with
you
guys
anyway?
It's
complicated.
Tell
me
again,
was
I
really
good?
I
was
so
nervous.
-
Your
knees
were
fine.
Yes,
it
was.
It's
the
acoustics.
It
keeps
the
sound
waves
from
grouping.
-
You
see,
when
the
sound
waves,
they
propagate,
then
it's
like
an...
Did
you
see
that
one?
You
know
what?
I'd
like
to
sing
on
stage
for
the
rest
of
my
life
with
you
in
the
first
row.
I'll
be
there.
Tell
me
you
love
me.
I
love
you.
I
love
you
so
much.
I
always
have.
You
can't
hide
here,
Flint.
I'm
just
here
to
see
my
daughter.
You
are
an
escaped
convict.
The
cops
are
looking
for
you.
You're
not
getting
near
her.
You're
nothing
but
a
common
thief.
You
maybe
even
killed
a
man.
It
wasn't
even
like
that.
Wasn't.
I
had
good
reason
for
what
I
was
doing.
And
that's
the
truth.
You
and
the
truth,
sitting
in
prison,
having
three
meals
a
day
together.
I
live
in
a
prison.
It's
a
great
truth.
And
that
is
the
truth
that
you
left
behind.
Right
there
in
that
bedrooom.
I
missed
you.
I
missed
you
too,
Daddy.
I
promise
I'll
make
you
healthy
again.
Whatever
it
takes.
-
I'll
get
the
money.
Now.
I'm
not
a
bad
person.
Just
had
bad
luck.
Peter,
what
is
it?
It's
MJ...
I'm
gonna
ask
her
to
marry
me!
Oh,
Peter!
Oh!
The
day
that
uncle
Ben
asked
me
to
marry
him,
he
was
so
scared
and
excited.
And
very
young.
And
I
loved
him
so
fiercely.
Then
you
said
yes,
right?
No.
I
wanted
to
say
yes,
but
I
said
no.
I
wasn't
ready,
neither
was
he.
So
we
took
our
time.
Looked
forward
to
it.
Didn't
want
to
run
into
something
with
nothing
to
count
on
but
love.
A
man
has
to
be
understanding
and
put
his
wife
before
himself.
Can
you
do
that,
Peter?
Yeah.
I
think
I
can.
Then
you
have
my
blessing.
I
hope
you've
considered
a
proper
proposal.
Your
uncle
had
it
all
planned.
He
took
me
to
the
beach
one
Sunday.
He
was
a
knockout
in
his
bathing
suit.
And
I,
I
didn't
look
too
bad
myself.
We
were
very
good
swimmers.
It
was
a
beautiful
day,
and
he
said:
"Let's
swim
to
the
island."
And
at
the
island,
we
found
a
perfect
spot
by
an
old
tree,
and
we
lay
down
and
looked
up
at
the
sky.
And
then
he
said,
"Close
your
eyes,
May."
And
I
did.
And
then
he
said,
"Open
them."
And
I
did.
And
he
was
holding
this
ring.
Dazzling,
in
front
of
me.
I
thought
it
was
the
sun.
We'd
be
married
50
years
come
August...
if...
So.
I
hope
you
make
it
very
special
for
Mary
Jane.
Do
something
she'll
never
forget.
Give
her
this.
Come
on.
Take
it.
-
Harry.
Listen
to
me!
I
didn't
kill
your
father!
He
was
trying
to
kill
me.
He
killed
himself.
Shut
up!
I'm
still
here,
Peter!
Hate
those
things.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry!
Oh
my
God.
Harry!
Come
on!
God!
-
200.
-
No
response.
Clear!
No
response.
We
charge
it
one
more
time.
And
clear!
Captain
Stacey.
-
What's
this?
-
What
about
him?
-And?
He's
in
the
Marshlands.
I
think
we
got
him.
There
he
is!
"DANGER
PARTICLE
PHYSICS
Eton,
take
the
west
side.
Tom,you
take
the
east.
Where'd
he
go?
-That's
it.
It's
charged.
Donnie,
we
got
a
little
fluctuation
on
1.
There's
a
change
in
the
silicon
mass.
It's
probably
a
bird.
It'll
fly
away
when
we
fire
it
up.
Initiating
demoleculisation.
-How
is
he?
But
there's
been
some
memory
impairment.
Particularly
his
short-term
memory.
Right
now,
he
can't
remember
the
accident
or
anything
that
happened
to
him
recently.
Is
it
permanent?
It
could
be.
Only
time
will
tell.
He's
awake
if
you
want
to
see
him.
Uh--
maybe
I
should
wait.
Nah,
it's
fine.
Just
keep
it
brief.
Allow
him
to
rest.
-
Hey,
buddy.
Hit
my
head.
Yeah.
Doctor
said
I
was
in
an
accident.
Hit
and
run.
I
don't
remember
much
of
anything.
My
father--
he
died,
right?
This
is
all
so
weird.
Hi.
I
got
here
as
fast
as
I
could.
I
know
that
face.
How
are
you
doing?
I
don't
know.
Last
thing
I
remember,
I
was
falling...
somewhere.
You're
still
fine.
We
love
you,
Harry.
It
feels
like
somehow
I've
been
gone
for
a
really
long
time.
Now
I'm
back
home.
It's
good
to
have
you
back.
I'm
sorry,
I'm
gonna
have
to
ask
you
guys
to
scoot,
OK?
-
OK.
Well,
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.
Yeah,
great.
I
think
he's
gonna
be
fine.
Think
so.
-
And
you
guys
seem
great.
You
have
lovely
friends.
My
best
friends.
I'd
give
my
life
for
them.

You
know
I
can't
open
the
door.
It's
stuck
again?
Come
on
and
help
me.
I'm
coming.
-
The
review.
The
hated
it.
They
hated
me.
Well,
they
can't
hate
you.
"The
young
Miss
Watson
is
a
pretty
girl."
"Easy
on
the
eyes,
but
not
on
the
ears."
"Her
small
voice
didn't
carry
past
the
first
row."
That's
ridiculous.
I
was
right
there.
You
were
in
the
first
row.
Yeah,
but
that's...
Listen.
You
were
great.
That's
a
critic.
This
is
something
you're
gonna
have
to
get
used
to.
Believe
me,
I
know.
-
Spider-Man
gets
attacked
all
the
time.
It's
about
me.
-
It's
about
my
career.
you
can't
let
it
bring
you
down.
You
just
gotta
believe
in
yourself.
-
and
you
get
right
back
on
the
horse.
Try
to
understand
how
I
feel.
It's
just...
I
look
at
these
words,
and
it's
like
my
father
wrote
them.
All
cars.
All
cars
in
the
vicinity
of
54th
and
6th
Ave,
Go
get
'em,
tiger.
Sorry.
Oh
my
God.
Seven
*Atom*
to
Central.
That
crane's
sheaves
are
off..
It's
bigger
than
we
thought.
Shutting
down
the
accelerator!
Now!
OK,
Gwen.
What
is
that
thing
doing
in
my
background?
Captain
Stacey,
the
guys
looks
*kind
short
of
it.
Get
Edison
on
the
phone.
Have
them
kill
the
power
of
the
whole
block.
Are
you
all
right?
It's
coming
back!
Oh
my
God.
It's
Gwen!
What?
What's
she
doing
up
there?
I
don't
know.
I
just
saw
her
last
night.
-Who
are
you?
Eddie
Brock,
jr.
I
work
at
the
Daily
Bugle.
And
I'm
dating
your
daughter.
-You
OK?
I'm
fine.
Thank
you.
Hey,
Spidey,
hold
on.
Bugle
needs
a
photo.
-Thank
God,
you're
OK.
-Hey.
I'm
the
new
guy.
From
now
on,
I'm
gonna
be
taking
shots
of
you
for
the
Bugle.
So--
smile!
Are
you
smiling?
Where's
the
other
guy?
Yeah,
um,
look,
between
you
and
me--
The
guy's
kind
of
an
amateur.
Have
you
noticed,
his
stuff
makes
you
look
a
little...
bloated.
-Just
a
little
chunky.
Don't
have
to
worry
about
that
anymore,
buddy.
Dazzeling.
Just
a
little
something
the
boys
in
the
ad
department
and
I
whipped
up.
As
you
know,
circulation
of
the
Bugle
has
been
pretty
good.
Though
not
as
good
as
the
New
York
Times
or
the
Daily
News
-or
the
Post
or
several
other
smaller...
-What?
-Your
wife
told
me
to
tell
you
to
watch
the
anger.
Thank
you.
So,
I
propose
this
campaign:
"DAILY
BUGLE"
--
that's
obvious.
"IT'S
HIP,
IT'S
NOW"
--
I
came
up
with
that
one.
"IT'S
WOW"
--
that's
actually
Eric's.
"AND
HOW!"
--
that's
me
again.
Time
to
take
your
pill.
Not
that
one.
Not
that
one.
Drink
plenty
of
water.
Thank
you.
Continue.
He's
busy.
Oh,
no,
I'm
just
here
to
talk
to
you,
babe.
That's
a
little
something
called
"Nice
'n'
Easy".
-What's
on
you?
-That
is
the
dumbest
idea
you've
ever
had.
You
have
had
some
daunting...
Hey,
where
are
you
going?
-Who
are
you?
-Freelance.
Brock,
Sir.
Edward
Brock
junior.
Wow,
I
really
like
that
shirt.
Here.
It's
a
crane
accident.
Check
out
the
light
source.
He
likes
my
shirt.
-Hey,
Betty.
A
new
guy.
He's
trying
to
sell
some
Spidey
photos.
Uh.
Thanks.
Parker!
You're
late!
Maybe
too
late.
Bruckner
here
beat
ya
to
it.
-It's
Brock,
sir.
Edward
Brock
junior.
But
he
got
me
this.
-Wait.
How'd
you
get
that?
I
didn't
see
you.
Climbed.
Nearly
fell
off
a
flagpole.
A
flagpole?
-Which
one
do
we
use?
-It's
better.
Congratulations,
son.
We'll
use
your
shot
and
pay
you
50
bucks.
Uh--
all
right,
JJ.
I'm
your
man.
I
know
more
about
what
makes
a
good
picture
than
any
photographer
in
this
town.
--
no
offense
--
flagpoles.
Whatever.
It's
about
lighting.
Composition.
Drama.
I
want
a
staff
job,
sir.
I
have
a
girl
that
I
intend
to
marry,
and--
I
have
this
stupid
little
dream
of--
working
with
one
of
the
greatest
newspaper
editors
of
our
time.
J.
Jonah
Jameson.
Well,
we
do
have
an
opening.
-Johnson
quit,
remember?
Wait
a
minute.
I
know
what
makes
a
good
picture,
and
I've
been
here
for
a
long
time.
If
there's
a
staff
job,
Mr
Jameson,
I
think
I
deserve
it.
He's
right,
Jonah.
Peter's
been
with
us
for
years.
He's
done
a
great
job.
You
want
a
staff
job,
and
you
want
a
staff
job.
Anybody
care
about
what
I
want?
I
do.
I
want
the
public
to
see
Spider-Man
for
the
two-bit
criminal
he
really
is.
He's
a
fake.
He's
full
of
stickum.
Catch
him
in
the
act.
"Spider-Man
with
his
hand
in
the
cookie
jar".
Whoever
brings
me
that
photo
gets
the
job.
What
are
you
waiting
for,
Chinese
New
Year?
Go,
go,
go!
I'm
on
it,
boss.
You'll
never
get
that
shot.
We'll
see.
You
know,
I
guess
one
person
can
make
a
difference.
'Nuff
said.
Welcome
home,
Harry.
Thank
God
you're
all
right.
Thanks,
Bernard.
-Aperitif?
Got
you
a
little
homecoming
present.
-Wha--
It's
your
old
ball!
Thanks,
buddy.
We
were
pretty
good
in
the
backyard,
weren't
we?
We
were
terrible.
And
we
tried
out
for
the
varsity
team.
-Yeah,
for
the
cheerleaders.
Hey,
do
I
have
any
girlfriends?
-I
don't
know.
-Hey
Bernard,
do
I
have
any
girlfriends?
That's
a
pretty
cool
pass,
huh?
It's
OK.
Looks
like
I'm
not
worrying
for
money.
No.
Well,
I
bet
I
can
turn
this
little
girlfriend
thing
around.
You
know,
he
always
appreciated
how
you
helped
me
through
high
school.
I
just
wish
I
could
remember
more
about
him.
He
loved
you.
That's
the
main
thing.
Hey,
let's
watch
the
game
in
the
kitchen.
-
Get
something
to
eat.
Whoa,
catch
that!
Did
you
see
that?
Still
got
the
moves.
Yeah!
Why
are
you
stopping?
What
is
she
doing
here?
Hi,
honey.
We
tried
to
reach
you.
I'm
sorry.
-
One
critic?
-
Mary
Jane,
honey.
Sit
down.
Let's
explain
it
to
you.
-
That
was
so
poorly
handled.
All
right,
Spidey!
Excuse
me,
miss.
Let
me
see
that
gorgeous
smile.
Hi,
Eddie.
You're
so
beautiful.
This
is
front
page
stuff.
I've
got
to
practice.
I'll
see
you
later,
OK?
-
How
about
tonight?
Why
not?
Think
of
that
amazing--
night
that
we
had.
We
had
a
coffee,
Eddie.
Hey,
beautiful.
One
more.
-
Everything
OK?
You're
not
still
mad
at
me,
are
you?
No,
Peter.
I'm
proud
of
you.
Hey.
I'm
gonna
be
swingin'
it
from
over
there.
So
you
know
where
to
look.
Give
'em
a
good
show.
Don't
worry
about
that
review.
We're
gonna
be
laughing
about
it
tomorrow
night.
-
Promise.
Isn't
that
that
guy
from
that
prison
break?
He
fits.
Hey
you!
Halt!
Cover
the
back!
Fire!
People
of
the
city
of
New
York,
I
am
here
today
because
I
fell
62
storeys
and
someone
caught
me.
Someone
who
never
asks
for
anything
in
return.
Someone
who
doesn't
even
want
us
to
know
who
he
is.
-
Hey,
MJ.
Where
is
Pete?
Um--
taking
somebody's
picture,
I
guess.
I'm
so
happy
to
see
you.
You
look
so
good.
I've
never
felt
better.
It's
a
weird
feeling,
not
knowing
New
York.
Bump
on
the
head,
I'm
just
free
as
a
bird.
-
Will
you
bump
me
on
the
head?
Hey,
Pete
said
you're
in
a
play.
You
came.
You
sent
me
flowers.
I
did?
I'll
come
again
tonight.
You
can't.
I--I
was
let
go.
What
happened.
I
wasn't
very
good.
You
know,
this
is
embarrassing,
but...
I
once
wrote
you
a
play
in
high
school.
You
wrote
me
a
play?
-
Yeah.
I
ask
you:
When
you're
dropping
without
a
parachute
or
your
store's
being
robbed
or
your
house
is
on
fire,
who
is
it
that
brakes
your
fall,
puts
out
the
flames
and
saves
your
children?
Spider-Man!
They
love
me!
Then
let's
hear
it!
For
your
one
and
only
friendly
neighborhood...
Spider-Man!

Go
ahead,
lay
it
right
on
me.
-
Really?

Kiss
him!
Kiss
him!
Right...
Hope
Pete's
getting
a
shot
of
this.
-
Hey,
are
you
OK?
Jig's
up,
pal.
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you.
-
Leave
now.
I'm
the
sheriff
'round
these
parts.
OK.
Where
do
all
these
guys
come
from?
Bonsoir.
Le
monsieur
a-t-il
un
"reservation"?
-
I'm
sorry,
I
don't
speak...
Oui.
-
Name,
please?
Ah.
Here
we
are.
Table
for
two.
Pekar.
-
Parker.
Pekar.
Um,
I
have
a
request.
My
girlfriend
will
be
coming,
and
I
have
this
ring.
Ah.
All.
Oh,
so
you
want
to
pop
the
question
tonight,
hein?
Yes,
and
I
want
to
do
something
very
special.
I
love
it.
Romance.
I
am
French.
When
I
signal
you,
if
you'd
bring
some
champagne
with
the
ring...
Inside
bottom
of
her
glass?
-
Perfect.
Also
I
thought,
at
the
same
time
could
the
musicians
play
this
song?
Their
favorite.
And
take
good
care
of
the
ring.
