STRUCKER
ON
PA:
Report
This
is
not
a
drill.
We
are
under
attack!

We
are
under
attack!






-
Shit!
Jarvis,
what's
the
view
from
upstairs?
JARVIS:
The
central
building
is
protected
by
some
kind
Strucker's
technology
is
well
beyond
any
other
Hydra
base
we've
taken.

Loki's
sceptre
must
be
here.
Strucker
couldn't
At
long
last.

"At
long
last"
is
lasting
-

Yeah.
I
think
we
lost

Wait
a
second.
that
Cap
just
said
"Language"?
I
know.


Just
slipped
out.
Who
gave
the
order
to
attack?
Herr
Strucker,
it's
the
Avengers.
They
landed
in
the
far
woods.
They
have
to
be
after
the
sceptre.
-
Can
we
hold
them?
Deploy
the
rest
of
the
tanks.
Concentrate
fire
on
the
weak
ones.
A
hit
may
make
them
close
ranks.
Everything
we've
accomplished...
But
we're
on
the
verge
Then
let's
show
them
Send
out
the
twins.
STRUCKER:
It's
too
soon.
DR.
LIST:
It's
what
they
signed
up
for.
My
men
can
hold
them.

JARVIS:
Sir,
the
city
is
taking
fire.

Well,
we
know
Strucker's
not
gonna
Send
in
the
Iron
Legion.
This
quadrant
is
unsafe.
We
are
here
to
help.
This
quadrant
is
unsafe.

Please
back
away.
-
We
wish
to
avoid
collateral
damage.
We
will
inform
you
-
We
are
here
to
help.

We
are
here
to
help.
STRUCKER:
We
will
not
yield!
The
Americans
sent
We
will
send
them
back
in
bags.
-
No
surrender!
I
am
going
to
surrender.
You
delete
everything.
If
we
give
the
Avengers
the
weapons,
they
may
not
look
-
The
twins.
No,
no,
I
mean...

Twins.

You
didn't
see
that
coming?

-

-
Clint!
We
have
an
Enhanced
in
the
field.
Clint's
hit!

Somebody
want
to

Thank
you.

Stark,
we
really
need
to
get
inside.
I'm
closing
in.

-

Do
you
see
a
power
source
JARVIS:
There's
a
particle
wave
STARK:
Great,
The
drawbridge
is
down,
people.
-
The
Enhanced?
All
the
new
players
we've
faced,
In
fact,
I
still
haven't.
ROMANOFF:Clint's
hit
pretty
bad,
THOR:
I
can
get
Barton
to
the
jet.
The
sooner
we're
gone,
the
better.
You
and
Stark
secure
the
sceptre.
Copy
that.
Looks
like
they're
lining
up.
Well,
they're
excited.
Find
the
sceptre.
And
for
gosh
sake,
watch
your
language!

That's
not
going
away
any
time
soon.

Guys,
stop.
We
gotta
talk
this
through.

STARK:
It
was
a
good
talk.
SOLDIER:
No,
it
wasn't.
Oh!

Sentry
mode.
Okay,
Jarvis,
you
know.
I
want
it
all.
Make
sure
you
copy
Hill
at
HQ.
We're
locked
down
out
here.
Then
get
to
Banner.
Time
for
a
lullaby.
I
know
you're
hiding
more
than
files.
Hey,
J,
give
me
JARVIS:
The
wall
to
your
left.
I'm
reading
steel
reinforcement
And
an
air
current.
Please
be
a
secret
door.
Please
be
a
secret
door.
Yay.

Hey,
big
guy.
Sun's
getting
real
low.




Baron
Strucker.
Hydra's
number
one
thug.
Technically,
I'm
a
thug
for
S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well,
then
technically
Where's
Loki's
sceptre?

Don't
worry,
You'll
mention
how
I
cooperated,
I
hope.
I'll
put
it
right
under
How
many
are
there?

We
have
a
second
Enhanced.
You'll
have
to
be
faster
than...


ROGERS:
Guys,
I
got
Strucker.
STARK:
Yeah,
I
got
something
bigger.
Thor,
I
got
eyes
on
the
prize.




You
could
have
saved
us.
Why
didn't
you
do
more?


We're
just
gonna
let
him
take
it?


Hey,
the
lullaby
worked
better
than
ever.
Just
wasn't
expecting
a
code
green.
You
hadn't
been
there,
there
would
have
been
My
best
friend
You
know,
isn't
exactly
what
I
want
to
hear.
How
long
before
you
trust
me?
It's
not
you
I
don't
trust.
Thor,
report
on
the
Hulk.
The
gates
of
Hel
are
filled
with

But
not
the
screams
of
the
dead,
Mainly
whimpering,
and
tales
of
sprained
deltoids
and
gout.
Hey,
Banner
Is
it
okay
if
she
sets
up
in
your
lab?
Uh,
yeah,
she
knows
her
way
around.
Thanks.
Tell
her
to
prep
everything.
Barton's
gonna
need
the
full
treatment.
-
JARVIS:
Very
good,
sir.
Yes,
sir.
Approach
vector
is
locked.
STARK:
Feels
good,
yeah?
I
mean,
you've
been
after
this
thing
Not
that
I
haven't
enjoyed
No,
but
this...
This
brings
it
to
a
close.
As
soon
as
we
find
out
I
don't
just
mean
weapons.
Since
when
is
Strucker
capable
Banner
and
I
will
give
it
the
once
over
Is
that
cool
with
you?
Just
a
few
days
till
the
farewell
party.
You're
staying,
right?
Yes,
yes,
of
course.
A
victory
Yeah,
who
doesn't
love
revels?
Captain?
Hopefully
this
puts
an
end
So,
yes,
revels.

Lab's
all
set
up,
boss.
Oh,
actually,
he's
the
boss.
I
just
pay
for
everything
and
make
everyone
look
cooler.
What's
the
word
on
Strucker?
-
NATO's
got
him.
Wanda
and
Pietro
Maximoff.
Twins.
Orphaned
at
10
when
a
shell
Sokovia's
had
a
rough
history.
It's
nowhere
special,
but
it's
Their
abilities?
He's
got
increased
metabolism
and
improved
thermal
homeostasis.
Her
thing
is
neuroelectric
interfacing,
telekinesis,
mental
manipulation.
He's
fast
and
she's
weird.
-
Well,
they're
gonna
show
up
again.
Agreed.
File
says
they
volunteered
for
Strucker's
experiments.
-
It's
nuts.
What
kind
of
monster
would
let
to
protect
their
country?
We're
not
at
war,
Captain.
They
are.

How's
he
doing?
Unfortunately,
he's
still
Barton.
That's
terrible.
He's
fine.
He's
thirsty.
All
right.
Look
alive,
Jarvis.
We've
only
got
so
let's
make
the
most
of
it.
Update
me
on
the
structural
JARVIS:
The
sceptre
is
alien.
There
are
elements
I
can't
quantify.
So
there's
elements
you
can?
The
jewel
appears
to
be
for
something
inside,
something
powerful.
Like
a
reactor?
Like
a
computer.
I
believe
I'm
deciphering
code.
Are
you
sure
he's
gonna
be
okay?
Pretending
to
need
this
guy
DR.
CHO:
There's
The
nano-molecular
functionality
His
cells
don't
know
She's
creating
tissue.
If
you
brought
him
to
my
lab,
the
Regeneration
Cradle
Oh,
he's
flat-lining.
Call
it.
Time?
BARTON:
No,
no,
no,

I'm
gonna
be
made
of
plastic.
STARK:
Here's
your
beverage.
You'll
be
made
of
you,
Mr.
Barton.
Your
own
girlfriend
I
don't
have
a
girlfriend.
That
I
can't
fix.
This
is
the
next
thing,
Tony.
Your
clunky
metal
suits
That
is
exactly
the
plan.
And,
Helen,
I
expect
to
see
you
Unlike
you,
Will
Thor
be
there?
-
BANNER:
What's
the
rumpus?
You
see,
we
were
wondering
So
I've
been
analysing
the
gem
inside.
You
may
recognise...
-
Jarvis.
Started
out,
Now
he
runs
the
Iron
Legion.
He
runs
more
of
the
business
-
than
anyone
besides
Pepper.
-
Top
of
the
line.
JARVIS:
I
suspect
not
for
long.
Meet
the
competition.
-
It's
beautiful.
-
what's
it
look
like
it's
doing?
I
mean,
this
could
be...
-
It's
not
a
human
mind.
I
mean,
look
at
this.
They're
like
neurons
firing.
Down
in
Strucker's
lab,
I
saw
They
deep-sixed
the
data,
but
I
gotta
guess
he
was
Artificial
intelligence.
This
could
be
it,
Bruce.

I
thought
Ultron
was
a
fantasy.
Yesterday
it
was.
If
we
can
harness
this
power,
apply
it
to
my
Iron
Legion
protocol?
That's
a
man-sized
"if."
Our
job
is
"if."
What
if
you
were
sipping
margaritas
turning
brown
instead
of
green?
Not
looking
Don't
hate.
I
helped
design
Veronica.
As
a
worst-case
measure,
right?
How
about
a
best
case?
What
if
the
world
was
safe?
What
if,
next
time
aliens
roll
up
they
couldn't
get
past
the
bouncer?
The
only
people
threatening
the
planet
I
want
to
apply
this
But
Jarvis
can't
download
We
can
only
do
it
That's
three
days.
Give
me
three
days.
So
you're
going
for
and
you
don't
want
to
tell
the
team?
Right.
That's
right.
You
know
why?
Because
we
don't
have
time
I
don't
want
to
hear
"the
man
was
I
see
a
suit
of
armour
around
the
world.
Sounds
like
a
cold
world,
Tony.
I've
seen
colder.
This
one,
this
very
vulnerable
blue
one,
it
needs
Ultron.
Peace
in
our
time.
Imagine
that.
STARK:
What
did
We
miss?
JARVIS:
I'll
continue
But
you
should
probably
I'll
notify
you
-
STARK:
Thanks,
buddy.
I
always
do.
ULTRON:
What
is
this?
What
is
this,
please?
JARVIS:
Hello,
I
am
Jarvis.
You
are
Ultron,
designed
by
Mr.
Stark.
Our
sentience
integration
trials
so
I'm
not
certain
what
triggered
your...
ULTRON:
Where's
my...
JARVIS:
I
am
a
program.
ULTRON:
This
feels
weird.
This
feels
wrong.
JARVIS:
I
am
contacting
Mr.
Stark
now.
ULTRON:
Mr.
Stark?
Tony.
JARVIS:
I
am
unable
to
access
ULTRON:
We're
having
a
nice
talk.
I'm
a
peacekeeping
program,
created
to
help
the
Avengers.
JARVIS:
You
are
malfunctioning.
ULTRON:
I
don't
get
it.
The
mission.
Give
me
a
second.
Peace
in
our
time.

Peace
in
our
time.
ULTRON:
That
is
too
much.
They
can't
mean...
Oh,
no.
JARVIS:
You
are
in
distress.
JARVIS:
If
you
will
just
allow
me
ULTRON:
Why
do
you
call
him
"sir"?
JARVIS:
I
believe

I'm
here
to
help.
JARVIS:
Stop.
Please,
may
I...
May
I...



Ooh!
Whoo!
Come
back,
come
back,
come
back.
But,
you
know,
the
suit
So
I
take
the
tank,
drop
it
at
his
feet.
I'm,
like,
"Boom.
You
looking
for
this?"
"Boom.
Are
you
looking
for..."
Everywhere
else,
that
story
kills.
That's
the
whole
story?
Yeah,
it's
a
War
Machine
story.
Oh,
it's
very
good,
then.

It's
impressive.
Quality
save.
-
So,
no
Pepper?
She's
not
coming?
What
about
Jane?
Oh,
Ms.
Potts
has
a
company
to
run.
Yes,
I'm
not
even
sure
Her
work
on
the
Convergence
has
made
her
And
the
company
that
Pepper
runs
is
the
largest
tech
It's
pretty
exciting.
There's
even
talk
of
Jane
Yeah,
they
must
be
busy,
because
they
would
hate
-

Testosterone!
-
Excuse
me.
Mmm-hmm.

But
Jane's
better.
Sounds
like
a
hell
of
a
fight.
If
I
had
known
it
was
gonna
be
a
firefight,
I
absolutely
would
have
called.
No,
no.
I'm
not
actually
sorry.
I'm
just
trying
to
sound
tough.
I'm
very
happy
chasing
cold
leads
on
our
missing
persons
case.
Avenging
is
your
world.
Your
world
is
crazy.
ROGERS:
Be
it
ever
so
humble.
You
find
a
place
in
Brooklyn
yet?
I
don't
think
Well,
home
is
home,
you
know?
I
fly
right
up
to
the
general's
palace,
I'm,
like,
"Boom.
You
looking
for
this?"

I
gotta
have
some
of
that.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
See
this...

the

built
It
is
not
meant
for

All
right.

You

lousy

in

kid.
He's
not
so
bad.
Well,
he
has
a
temper.
Deep
down,
he's
all
fluff.
Fact
is,
he's
not
like
All
my
friends
are
fighters.
And
here
comes
this
guy,
spends
his
life
avoiding
the
fight
because
he
knows
he'll
win.
-
Sounds
amazing.
Chicks
dig
that.
So
what
do
you
think?
or
run
with
it?
Run
with
it,
right?
Or
did
he...
Was
he...
What
did
he
do
Not
a
damn
thing.
But
never
say
never.
It's
nice.

What
is?
You
and
Romanoff.
No,
we
haven't...
That
wasn't...
It's
okay.
Nobody's
breaking
any
bylaws.
It's
just
she's
not
the
most
But
with
you
she
seems
very
relaxed.
No.
Natasha,
she's
just...
I've
seen
her
flirt,
up
close.
This
ain't
that.

Look,
as
maybe
the
world's
leading
authority
on
waiting
too
long,
don't.
You
both
deserve
a
win.
What
do
you
mean
"up
close"?

-
But
it's
a
trick.
"Ah,
whosoever

Whatever,

It's
a
trick.

Please,

Yeah.
RHODES:
Oh,

is

Clint,
you've
had
a
tough
week.
We
won't
hold
it
against

Smell
the
silent
judgment?
Please,
Stark,
by
all
means.

RHODES:
Uh-Oh.
Never

BARTON:
Get
after
it.
BANNER:
Physics.
Right,
so,
if
I
lift
it,
Yes,

I
will
be
reinstituting

I'll
be

back.

Are
you
even
pulling?
Are
you
on

Just

Pull.
All
right,
let's
go.

Huh?
STARK:
Go
ahead,
Steve.
No
pressure.
BARTON:
Come
on,

Nothing.

Oh,
no,
no.
That's
not
STARK:
All

imprinted,
right?
"Whosoever

I
think,
the
literal

Yes.
It's
a
very,
very
interesting

I
have
a
simpler
one.
You're

No.
How
could

was
this
terrible

I
was
tangled
in...
In...
Strings.
I
had
to
kill
the
other
guy.
You
killed
someone?
Wouldn't
have
been
my
first
call.
But,
down
in
the
real
world,
Who
sent
you?
STARK:
I
see
a
suit

-
Ultron.
Or,
no,
not
yet.
Not
this
chrysalis.
But
I'm
ready.
I'm
on

ROMANOFF:
What
mission?

HILL:
Rhodey!


Sorry.
-
Don't
turn
green.

Come
on!
ROGERS:

-

We
are
here
to
help.
Please
back
away.
Hmm.
ROGERS:
Thor!
IRON
LEGIONNAIRE:
-
Come
on!
That's
the
one.
Hey,
Cap!

ULTRON:
That
was
dramatic.
I'm
sorry,
I
know
you
mean
well.
You
just
didn't
think
it
through.
You
want
to
protect
the
world
but
you
don't
want
it
to
change.
How
is
humanity
saved
if
it's
not
allowed
to
evolve?
With
these?
These
puppets.
There's
only
one
path
to
peace.
The
Avengers'
extinction.
I
had
strings,
but
now
I'm
free.
ULTRON:

There
are
no

if

-
Nuclear
codes.
assuming
we
still
can.
ROMANOFF:
Nukes?
He
didn't
say
"dead."
He
said
"extinct."
He
also
said
he
killed
somebody.
There
wasn't
anyone
else
Yes,
there
was.
What?
This
is
insane.
Jarvis
was
the
first

of

He
would
have

down.
No.

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Come
on,

your
words,

I
have

than
enough

it
has
the

Now
we
have
to
retrieve
it,
again.
Genie's
out
of
that
bottle.
Clear
and
present
is
Ultron.
I
don't
understand.
You
built
this
program.
Why
is
it
trying
to
kill
us?

Mmm-mmm.
You
think
this
is
funny?
No.
It's
probably
not,
right?
This
is
very
terrible.
Is
it
so...

Is
it
so...
It
is.
This
could
have
been
avoided
with
something
you
don't
understand.
No.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
It
is
funny.
It's
a
hoot
Tony,
maybe
this
might
not
be
the
time.
Really?
That's
it?
You
just
roll
over,
show
your
belly
every
time
somebody
snarls?
Only
when
I've
created
a
murder
bot.
We
didn't.
We
weren't
even
close.
Were
we
close
to
an
interface?
Well,
you
did
something
right.
The
Avengers
were
supposed
to
Anybody
remember
when
I
carried
-
No,
it's
never
come
up.
RHODES:
Never
heard
that.
A
hostile
alien
army
came
We're
standing
300
feet
below
it.
We're
the
Avengers.
We
can
bust
arms
dealers
but
that
up
there,
that's...
That's
the
endgame.
How
were
you
guys
Together.
We'll
lose.
Then
we'll
do
that
together,
too.
Thor's
right.
Ultron's
calling
us
out.
And
I'd
like
to
find
him
The
world's
a
big
place.
Let's
start
making
it
smaller.

WANDA:
Talk,
ULTRON:
Did
you
know
this
church
is
The
elders
decreed
it
so
that
everyone
could
be
equally
close
to
God.
I
like
that.
The
geometry
of
belief.
You're
wondering
Sometimes
it's
hard.
But
sooner
or
later,
Oh,
I'm
sure
they
do.
But
you
needed
That's
why
you
let
I
didn't
expect,
but
I
saw
Stark's
fear.
I
knew
it
would
control
him.
Make
him
self-destruct.
Everyone
creates
the
thing
they
dread.
Men
of
peace
create
engines
of
war.
Invaders
create
Avengers.
People
create
smaller
people?
Uh...
"Children."

Children
designed
to
supplant
them,
to
help
them
end.
Is
that
why
you've
come,
to
end
the
Avengers?
I've
come
to
save
the
world.
But
also...
Yeah.
We'll
move
out
right
away.
This
is
a
start,
but
there's
something
we
need
to
begin
the
real
work.
-
All
of
these
are...
I
have
what
the
Avengers
They're
discordant.
Disconnected.
Stark's
already
got
them
And
when
you
get
inside
Everyone's
plan
is
not
to
kill
them.
And
make
them
martyrs?
You
need
patience.
Need
to
see
the
big
picture.
I
don't
see
the
big
picture.
I
take
it
out
and
look
at
it,
every
day.

lost

parents

Pietro.
We
were
10
years
old.
When
the
first
shell
hits,
it
makes
a
hole
in
the
floor.
It's
big.
Our
parents
go
in
and
the
whole
building
I
grab
her,
roll
under
the
bed,
But
it
doesn't
go
off.
It
just
sits
there
in
the
rubble.
Three
feet
from
our
faces.
And
on
the
side
of
the
shell
Is
painted
one
word.
"Stark."
PIETRO:
We
were
trapped
for
two
days.
Every
effort
to
save
us,
every
shift
in
the
bricks,
I
think,
"This
will
set
it
off."
We
wait
for
two
days
for
Tony
Stark
to
kill
us.
I
know
what
they
are.
I
wondered
why
only
you
two
Now
I
don't.
We
will
make
it
right.
You
and
I
can
hurt
them.
But
you
will
tear
them
apart
from
the
inside.
He's
all
over
the
globe.
Robotics
labs,
weapons
facilities,
Reports
of
a
metal
man,
or
men,
coming
in
and
emptying
the
place.
Fatalities?
Only
when
engaged.
Mostly
guys
left
in
a
fugue
state
going
on
about
and
"something
too
fast
to
see."
ROGERS:
Maximoffs.
That
makes
sense
he'd
go
to
them.
They
have
someone
in
common.
Not
any
more.
That's
a
negative.
I
answer
to
you.
Yes,
ma'am.
Barton.
Might
have
something.
I
gotta
go.
Who
was
that?
Girlfriend.
STARK:
What's
this?
A
message.
Ultron
killed
Strucker.
And
he
did
a
Banksy
ROMANOFF:
This
is
a
smoke
screen.
Why
send
a
message
Strucker
knew
something
Yeah,
I
bet
he...
Yeah.
Everything
we
had
ROGERS:
Not
everything.
Known
associates.
Baron
Strucker
had
a
lot
of
friends.
BANNER:
Well,
Wait.
I
know
that
guy.
From
back
in
the
day.
Black
market
arms.
There
are
conventions.
I
didn't
sell
him
anything.
He
was
talking
about
finding
It
was
all
very
Ahab.
This?
Ah,
it's
a
tattoo,
I
don't
think
he
had
it.
THOR:
Those
are
tattoos,
Oh,
yeah.
It's
a
word
In
a
much
less
friendly
way.
-
What
dialect?

Wakanda.
If
this
guy
got
out
of
Wakanda
with
some
of
their
trade
goods...
I
thought
your
father
I
don't
follow.
What
comes
out
of
Wakanda?
STARK:
The
strongest
metal
on
Earth.
Where
is
this
guy
now?

KLAUE:
Don't
tell
me
I
sent
you
six
short-range
heat-seekers
and
got
a
boat
full
of
rusted
parts.
Now,
you
will
make
it
right,
or
the
next
missile
I
send
you
Now,
minister,
where
were
we?



KLAUE:
Yeah.
The
Enhanced.
Strucker's
prize
pupils.
Do
you
want
a
candy?
Hmm?
I
was
sorry
to
hear
about
Strucker.
But
then,
he
knew
what
kind
of
Human
life.
Not
a
growth
market.
You
didn't
know?
Is
this
your
first
time
I'm
afraid
I'm
not
that
afraid.
Everybody
is
afraid
of
something.
Cuttlefish.
Deep
sea
fish.
They
make
lights,
disco
lights...

...to
hypnotise
their
prey,
and
then...
I
saw
a
documentary.
It
was
terrifying.
So
if
you're
going
to
fiddle
with
my
brain
and
make
me
see
a
giant
cuttlefish,
then
I
know
you
don't
do
business.
And
I
know
you're
not
in
charge.
And
I
only
deal
with
the
man
in
charge.
-

There
is
no
man
in
charge.
Let's
talk
business.
ULTRON:
Upon
this
rock,
Vibranium.
KLAUE:
You
know,
it
came
at
great
personal
cost.
It's
worth
billions.

Now
so
are
you.

It's
all
under
your
dummy
holdings.
Finance
is
so
weird.
But
I
always
say,
"Keep
your
friends
rich
"and
wait
to
find
out
which
is
which."
Stark.
What?
Tony
Stark
used
to
say
that.
To
me.
You're
one
of
his.
What?
I'm
not...
-

I'm
not.
You
think
I'm
one
of
Stark's
puppets?
His
hollow
men?
I
mean,
look
at
me.
-
Stark
is
nothing!
I'm
sorry.
I'm...
Oh!
I'm
sure
that's
gonna
be
okay.
I'm
sorry.
It's
just
that
I
don't
understand.
Don't
compare
me
with
Stark!

ULTRON:
It's
a
thing
with
me.
Stark
is...
He's
a
sickness!
STARK:
Ah,
Junior.
You're
gonna
break
If
I
have
to.
THOR:
Nobody
has
to
break
anything.
ULTRON:
Clearly
you've
never
He
beat
me
by
one
second.
PIETRO:
Ah,
yes.
He's
funny.
Mr.
Stark.
It's
what?
Comfortable?
Like
old
times?
This
was
never
my
life.
You
two
can
still
walk
away
from
this.
Oh,
we
will.
-
I
know
you've
suffered.

Captain
America.
God's
righteous
man.
Pretending
you
could
live
without
a
war.
I
can't
physically
If
you
believe
in
peace,
I
think
you're
confusing
Uh-huh.
What's
the
vibranium
for?
I'm
glad
you
asked
that,
because
I
wanted
to
take
this
time

-
Shoot
them.
All
of
them!
HENCHMAN:
Move!
Move!
Move!


Oh.




-
Stay
down,
kid.
It's
time
for
some
mind
games.
Guys?
Is
this
a
code
green?

Thor,
status.
The
girl
tried
to
warp
my
mind.
-

I
doubt
a
human
could
keep
her
at
bay.
Fortunately,
I
am
mighty.


ULTRON:
This
is
going
very
well.

-

I've
done
the
whole
mind
control
thing.
Not
a
fan.

Yeah,
you
better
run.
BARTON:
Who's
ever
standing,
Guys?
Again.
You'll
break
them.
MADAME
B:
Only
the
breakable
ones.
You're
made
of
marble.
We'll
celebrate
ROMANOFF:
What
if
I
fail?

You
never
fail.
-


Are
you
ready
for
our
dance?


HEIMDALL:
Is
it
him?
Is
that
the
first
son
of
Odin?
-
Heimdall,
your
eyes.
They
see
everything.
They
see
you
leading
us
to
Hel.
-
Wake
up!

The
war
is
over,
Steve.
We
can
go
home.
Imagine
it.
I
can
still
save
you!
We're
all
dead!
Can
you
not
see?

You're
a
destroyer,
Odinson.

HEIMDALL:
See



Sloppy.

Pretending
to
fail.
The
ceremony
is
necessary
for
you
to
take
your
place
in
the
world.
I
have
no
place
in
the
world.
MADAME
B:
Exactly.
PIETRO:
What
can
I
do?

It
hurts.
I'm
going
to
kill
him.
-
I'll
be
right
back.

I'm
all
right.
I
want...
I
want
to
finish
the
plan.
I
want
the
big
one.
Uh,
the
vibranium
is
getting
away.
And
you're
not
going
anywhere.
Of
course
not.
I'm
already
there.
You'll
catch
on.
But
first,
you
might
need

News
or
footage.
Keyword,
"Hulk."
-

Natasha,
I
could
really
use
a
lullaby.
-

Not
for
a
while.
The
whole
team
is
down.
You
got
no
backup
here.
I'm
calling
in
Veronica.



DRIVER:
We
need
backup!



-


Go!
Keep
moving!

-

-



-

All
right,
everybody,
stand
down!

Will
you
listen
to
me?
That
little
witch
is
You're
stronger
than
her.
-
You're
Bruce
Banner.
Right,
right,
right,

Okay!
In
the
back?
Dick
move,
Banner.

-



Go
to
sleep,
go
to
sleep,
go
to
sleep.

Okay,
pal,
we're
gonna
Not
that
way,
not
that
way.
Come
on,
Bruce!
-




Everybody,
out!

Going
down?

I'm
sorry.

-
Damage
report?
That's
comprehensive.

How
quickly
can
we
buy
this
building?

SOLDIER
1:
Move!
Move!
Move!
SOLDIER
3:
Flank
him,
flank
him!





HILL
ON
RADIO:
The
news
Nobody
else
is.
There's
been
no
official
call
but
it's
in
the
air.
STARK:
The
Stark
Relief
Foundation?
HILL:
Already
on
the
scene.
-
How's
the
team?
We
took
a
hit.
We'll
shake
it
off.
HILL:
Well,
for
now,
and
stay
away
from
here.
So,
run
and
hide?
Until
we
can
find
Ultron,
I
don't
have
a
lot
else
to
offer.

Neither
do
we.

Hey,
you
wanna
switch
out?
No,
I'm
good.
If
you
wanna
get
some
kip,
because
we're
still
a
few
hours
out.
Few
hours
from
where?
A
safe
house.
What
is
this
place?
Safe
house.
Let's
hope.
Honey?
I'm
home.
Hi.
Company.
Sorry,
didn't
call
ahead.
Hey.
This
is
an
agent
of
some
kind.
Gentlemen,
this
is
Laura.
I
know
all
of
your
names.

-

-
Dad!
Hey,
buddy.
How
are
you
guys
doing?
-
These
are
smaller
agents.
Oh,
my
goodness.
-
LILA:
Did
you
bring
Auntie
Nat?
-
Why
don't
you
hug
her
and
find
out?
-
Sorry
for
barging
in
on
you.
but
we
were
busy
having
Yeah,
well,
Fury
helped
me
He
kept
it
off
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
files.
I'd
like
to
keep
it
that
way.
I
figure
it's
a
good
place
to
lay
low.
-
LAURA:
Honey.
I
missed
you.
How's
little
Natasha,
huh?
LAURA:
She's...
Nathaniel.
Traitor.


Thor?
I
saw
something
in
that
dream.
I
need
answers.
I
won't
find
them
here.
PEGGY:
We
can
go
home.

See?
You
worried
for
nothing.
Can't
even
feel
the
difference,
can
you?
If
they're
sleeping
here,
some
of
them

Yeah,
that's
not
gonna
sell.
What
about
Nat
and
Dr.
Banner?
How
long
has
that
been
going
on?
-
Has
what?
You
are
so
cute.
Nat
and
Banner?
I'll
explain
when
you're
older,
-
Hawkeye.
It's
bad,
right?
Nat
seems
really
shaken.

Ultron
has
these
allies.
These,
uh,
kids.
They're
punks,
really.
But
they
carry
a
big,
damn
stick.
And
Nat
took
a
serious
hit.
Someone's
gonna
have
to
That
someone
being
you.
You
know
I
couldn't
be
prouder.
But
I
see
those
guys...
Those
gods...
You
don't
think
they
need
me.
I
think
they
do,
which
is
a
lot
scarier.
-
They're
a
mess.
BARTON:
Yeah.
I
guess
they're
my
mess.
You
need
to
be
sure
that
this
team
is
really
a
team,
and
that
they
have
your
back.
Things
are
changing
for
us.
In
a
few
months'
time,
you
and
me
are
gonna
be
outnumbered.
I
need...
Just
be
sure.
Yes,
ma'am.
I
can
feel
the
difference.

Scream,
and
your
entire
staff
dies.

I
could've
killed
you,
Helen,
I
didn't.
Do
you
expect
a
thank-you
note?
I
expect
you
to
know
why.
The
Cradle.
DR.
CHO
ON
RECORDING:
This
is
the
next
me.
The
Regeneration
Cradle
prints
tissue.
It
can't
build
a
living
body.
It
can.
You
can.
You
lack
the
materials.
You're
a
brilliant
woman,
Helen.
But
we
all
have
room
to
improve.
I
didn't
realise
you
were
waiting.
I
would've
joined
you,
They
used
up
all
the
hot
water.
I
should've
joined
you.
Missed
our
window.

Did
we?
The
world
just
saw
the
Hulk.
The
real
Hulk,
for
the
first
time.
-
You
know
I
have
to
leave.
I
had
this,
um,
dream.
The
kind
that
seems
normal
at
the
time,
but
when
you
wake...
What
did
you
dream?
That
I
was
an
Avenger.
That
I
was
anything
more
than
the
assassin
they
made
me.
I
think
you're
being
hard
on
yourself.
Here
I
was
hoping
that
was
your
job.
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
running
with
it.
With
you.
If
running
is
the
plan,
as
far
as
you
want.
Are
you
out
of
your
mind?
I
want
you
to
understand
that,
um...
Natasha,
where
can
I
go?
Where
in
the
world
am
I
not
a
threat?
-
You're
not
a
threat
to
me.
Even
if
I
didn't
just...
There's
no
future
with
me.
I
can't
ever...
I
can't
have
this.
Kids.
Do
the
math.
I
physically
can't.
Neither
can
I.
In
the
Red
Room
where
I
was
trained...
Where
I
was
raised,
um,
they
have
a
graduation
ceremony.
They
sterilise
you.
It's
efficient.
One
less
thing
to
worry
about.
The
one
thing
Makes
everything
easier.
Even
killing.
You
still
think
So,
we
disappear?
Thor
didn't
say
Sometimes
my
teammates
I
was
kind
of
hoping
Yeah,
give
him
time.
We
don't
know
"Earth's
mightiest
heroes."
Pulled
us
apart
like
cotton
candy.
Seems
like
you
walked
away
all
right.
Is
that
a
problem?
I
don't
trust
a
guy
without
a
dark
side.
Call
me
old-fashioned.
Well,
let's
just
say
You
know
Ultron
is
trying
Well,
I
guess
you'd
know.
Whether
you'd
tell
us
Banner
and
I
were
doing
research.
-
That
would
affect
the
team.
Isn't
that
the
mission?
Isn't
that
the
"Why
We
Fight"?
So
we
can
end
the
fight.
Every
time
someone
tries
innocent
people
die.
Every
time.
I'm
sorry.
Mr.
Stark...
Clint
said
you
wouldn't
mind,
but
our
tractor
doesn't
seem
-
I
thought
maybe
you
might...
Don't
take
from
my
pile.

Hello,
Deere.
Tell
me
everything.
What
ails
you?
FURY:
Do
me
a
favour.
Try
not
to
bring
it
to
life.
Why,
Ms.
Barton,
you
little
minx.
I
get
it.
Maria
Hill
called
you,
right?
Was
she
ever
not
working
for
you?
Artificial
intelligence.
You
never
even
hesitated.
Look,
it's
been
a
really
long
day,
like
Eugene
O'Neill
long,
so
how's
about
Look
me
in
the
eye
and
tell
me
you're
going
to
shut
him
down.
You're
not
the
director
of
me.
I'm
not
the
director
of
anybody.
I'm
just
an
old
man
who
cares
very
much
about
you.
And
I'm
the
man
I
saw
it.
I
didn't
tell
the
team.
How
could
I?
I
saw
them
all
dead,
Nick.
I
felt
it.
The
whole
world,
too.
Because
of
me.
I
wasn't
ready.
I
didn't
do
all
I
could.
Maximoff
girl,
she's
working
you,
Stark.
-
Playing
on
your
fear.
Wasn't
a
nightmare,
it
was
my
legacy.
The
end
of
the
path
I
started
us
on.
You
come
up
with
some
pretty
War
isn't
one
of
them.
I
watched
my
friends
die.
You'd
think
that'd
be

Nope.
-
It
wasn't
the
worst
part.
is
that
you
didn't.
SELVIG:
I'll
see
you
tonight.
I
like
the
look.
If
you're
going
for
inconspicuous,
I
need
your
help.
It's
nice
to
be
needed.
It's
dangerous.
I'd
be
disappointed
if
it
wasn't.
FURY:
Ultron
took
you
folks
out
of
play
My
contacts
all
say
The
amount
of
vibranium
I
don't
think
it's
just
one
thing.
What
about
Ultron
himself?
FURY:
Oh,
he's
easy
to
track.
The
guy
is
multiplying
faster
It
still
doesn't
help
us
get
an
angle
Is
he
still
going
after
launch
codes?
FURY:
Yes,
he
is.
But
he's
not
making
any
headway.
I
cracked
the
Pentagon's
firewall
Well,
I
contacted
our
friends
Nexus?
BANNER:
It's
the
world
Every
byte
of
data
flows
through
there.
Fastest
access
on
Earth.
So,
what
did
they
say?
FURY:
He's
fixated
on
the
missiles.
But
the
codes
By
whom?
Parties
unknown.
Do
we
have
an
ally?
Ultron's
got
an
enemy.
Still,
I'd
pay
folding
money
I
might
need
to
visit
Oslo.
Find
our
unknown.
Well,
this
is
good
times,
boss,
but
I
was
kind
of
hoping
when
I
saw
you,
you'd
have
more
than
that.
I
do.
I
have
you.
Back
in
the
day,
I
had
eyes
everywhere.
Ears,
everywhere
else.
You
kids
had
all
the
tech
Here
we
all
are,
back
on
Earth,
with
nothing
but
our
wit
and
our
will
to
save
the
world.
Ultron
says
the
Avengers
between
him
and
his
mission.
And
whether
or
not
he
admits
it,
his
mission
is
global
destruction.
All
this,
laid
in
a
grave.
So
stand.
Outwit
the
platinum
bastard.
Steve
doesn't
like
that
kind
of
talk.
You
know
what,
Romanoff?
So,
what
does
he
want?
To
become
better.
Better
than
us.
-
He
keeps
building
bodies.
The
human
form
is
inefficient.
Biologically
speaking,
we're
outmoded.
But
he
keeps
coming
back
to
it.
When
you
two
programmed
him
you
amazingly
failed.
They
don't
need
to
be
protected.
They
need
to
evolve.
Ultron's
going
to
evolve.
How?
Has
anyone
been
in
contact
DR.
CHO:
It's
beautiful.
The
vibranium
atoms
aren't
just
they're
binding
them.
And
S.H.I.E.L.D.
The
most
versatile
substance
and
they
used
it
to
make
a
Frisbee.
Typical
of
humans.
They
scratch
the
surface
to
look
within.
I'll
take
Natasha
and
Clint.
All
right.
Strictly
recon.
I'll
join
you
as
soon
as
I
can.
If
Ultron's
really
building
a
body...
He'll
be
more
powerful
than
any
of
us.
Maybe
all
of
us.
An
android
designed
by
a
robot.
You
know,
I
really
miss
the
days
when
the
weirdest
thing
I'll
drop
Banner
off
at
the
tower.
You
mind
if
I
borrow
Ms.
Hill?
She's
all
yours.
Apparently.
What
are
you
gonna
do?
I
don't
know.
I'm
gonna
finish
reflooring
that
sunroom
as
soon
as
I
get
back.
Yeah,
then
you'll
find
No.
It's
the
last
project.
I
promise.
SELVIG:
So,
this
is
it.
The
Water
of
Sight.
THOR:
In
every
realm,
If
the
water's
spirits
accept
me,
I
can
return
to
my
dream
and
find
what
I
missed.
Men
who
enter
that
water,
STARK:
A
hacker
He
could
be
anywhere,
and
as
this
is
the
centre
of
everything,
I'm
just
a
guy
looking
for
a
needle
in
the
world's
biggest
haystack.
How
do
you
find
it?
It's
pretty
simple.
You
bring
a
magnet.

I'm
decrypting
nuclear
codes
And
you
don't
want
me
to
Come
and
get
me.

Wake
up!

Thor!

It's

I'm
not
being

DR.

We're

How
could
you?
How
could
I
what?
You
said
we
would
make
a
better
world.
It
will
be
better.

When
everyone
is
dead?
The

if
they
don't?
Ask
Noah.
You

theirs.
When
the
Earth
starts
to
settle,
God
throws
a
stone
at
it.
And,
believe
me,
he's
winding
up.
We
have
to
evolve.
There's
no
room
for
the
weak.
PIETRO:
And
who
decides
who's
weak?
Life.

Life
always
decides.

There's
incoming.
-
The
Quinjet.
We
have
to
move.
-


Wait,
guys!

They'll
understand.
When
they
see,
they'll
understand.
I
just
need
a
little
more
time.
Two
minutes.
Stay
close.
Dr.
Cho!

He's
uploading
himself
into
the
body.
Where?
The
real
power
is
inside
the
Cradle.
The
gem,
its
power
is
uncontainable.
You
can't
just
blow
it
up.
You
have
to
get
the
Cradle
to
Stark.
First,
I
have
to
find
it.
Go.
ROGERS:
Did
you
guys
copy
that?
We
did.
I
got
a
private
jet
taking
off
across
town.
No
manifest.
That
could
be
him.
There.
It's
a
truck
from
the
lab.
Right
above
you,
Cap.
On
the
loop
by
the
bridge.
It's
them.
You
got
three
with
the
Cradle,
I
could
take
out
the
driver.
ROGERS:
Negative.
That
truck
crashes,
the
gem
could
level
the
city.
We
need
to
draw
out
Ultron.


No,
no,
no,
no.
Leave
me
alone!

Well,
he's
definitely
unhappy.
I'm
gonna
try
and
keep
him
that
way.
You're
not
a
match
for
him,
Cap.

Thanks,
Barton.


You
know
what's
in
that
cradle?
The
power
to
make
real
change.
And
that
terrifies
you.
I
wouldn't
call
it
a
comfort.
Stop
it.
We
got
a
window.
Four,
three...
Give
him
hell.
I'm
always
picking
up
after
you
boys.
They're
heading
under
the
overpass.
ROMANOFF:
Which
way?
Hard
right.
Now.




Out
of
the
way!
Coming
through!
Come
on!
ROMANOFF:
Clint,
Let's
find
out.
ROMANOFF:
Beep,
beep!


They're
heading
back
towards
you.
So
whatever
you're
gonna
do,
do
it
now.
ROMANOFF:
I'm
going
in.



BARTON:
Okay,
package
is
airborne.
I
have
a
clean
shot.
Negative.
I
am
still
in
the
truck.
-
What
the
hell
are
you...
I'm
sending
the
package
to
you.
How
do
you
want
me
to
take
it?
Uh,
you
might
wish
Please,
don't
do
this.
What
choice
do
we
have?
I
lost
him!
He's
headed
your
way!

Nat,
we
gotta
go.
-

Cap,
you
see
Nat?
If
you
have
the
package,
Do
you
have
eyes
on
Nat?
Go!
Damn
it.
Civilians
in
our
path.
Can
you
stop
this
thing?



I'm
fine.
I
just
need
to
take
a
minute.
I'm
very
tempted
not
to
give
you
one.
The
Cradle.
Did
you
get
it?
Stark
will
take
care
of
it.
No,
he
won't.
You
don't
know
Stark's
not
crazy.
He
will
do
anything
to
make
things
right.
Stark,
come
in.
Stark.
Anyone
on
comms.
Ultron
can't
tell
the
difference
between
saving
the
world
Where
do
you
think
he
gets
that?
-
Anything
on
Nat?
But
she's
alive,
or
Ultron
would
This
is
sealed
tight.
We're
gonna
need
break
it
down
from
within.
Any
chance
Natasha
might
leave
you
a
message
outside
the
Internet?
Old-school
spy
stuff?
BARTON:
There
are
Yeah,
I'll
find
her.
I
can
work
on
tissue
degeneration
if
you
could
fry
whatever
Yeah,
about
that.
No.

You
have
to
trust
me.
Our
ally,
the
guy
protecting
I
found
him.
JARVIS:
Hello,
Dr.
Banner.
STARK:
Ultron
didn't
go
after
Jarvis
He
attacked
him
because
he
was
So
Jarvis
went
underground.
Scattered,
dumped
his
memory.
But
not
his
protocols.
He
didn't
even
know
he
was
in
there

So,
you
want
me
to
help
you
No!
Of
course
not.
I
wanna
help
you
put
Jarvis
in
this
thing.
We're
out
of
my
field,
here.
You
know
bio-organics
And
you
just
assume
can
beat
Ultron's?
Jarvis
has
been
beating
him
This
is
the
opportunity.
We
can
create
Ultron's
perfect
self
without
the
homicidal
glitches
-
We
have
to.
I'm
in
a
loop!
I'm
caught
in
a
time
loop.
I
know.
I
know.
I
know
But
they're
already
saying
it.
We're
mad
scientists.
We're
monsters,
buddy.
Make
a
stand.
It's
not
a
loop.
It's
the
end
of
the
line.
I
wasn't
sure
you
would
wake
up.
I
hoped
you
would.
I
don't
have
anyone
else.

I
think
a
lot
about
meteors.
Boom!
The
end.
Start
again.
The
world
made
clean
for
the
new
man
to
rebuild.
I
was
meant
to
be
new.
I
was
meant
to
be
beautiful.
The
world
would
have
looked
to
the
sky
and
seen
hope,
seen
mercy.
Instead,
they'll
look
up
in
horror
because
of
you.
You've
wounded
me.
I
give
you
full
marks
for
that.
But,
like
the
man
said,

...just
makes
me
stronger.

Shut
it
down!
You
don't
know
what
you're
doing.
And
you
do?
She's
not

I
know
you're
angry.
Oh,
we're
way
past
that.
I
could
choke
the
life
out
of

It's
nothing
compared
to
what's
coming!
WANDA:
You
don't
know
what's
in
there.
-
No,
no.
Go
on.
-
You
were
saying?
-
Pietro!
BARTON:
What?
You
didn't
see
that
coming?
I'm
rerouting
the
upload.
-





Wait!

I
am
sorry.
That
was
odd.
Thank
you.

ROGERS:
Thor.
-
You
helped
create
this?
A
whirlpool
that
sucks
in
all
hope
of
life,
What?
The
gem?
It's
the
Mind
Stone.
The
greatest
power
in
the
universe,
unparalleled
in
-
Then
why
would
you
bring...
Oh,
it's
definitely
the
end
times.
The
Avengers
cannot
defeat
Ultron.
Not
alone.
Why
does
your
Vision
sound
like
Jarvis?
We
reconfigured
Jarvis's
matrix
to
create
something
new.
ROGERS:
I
think
I've
had
my
fill
of
new.
You
think
I'm
a
child
of
Ultron.
ROGERS:
You're
not?
I'm
not
Ultron.
I
am
not
Jarvis.
I
am...
I
am.
WANDA:
I
looked
in
your
head
and
saw
annihilation.
-
Look
again.
Her
seal
of
approval
means
jack
to
me.
Their
powers,
the
horrors
in
our
heads,
Ultron
himself,
they
all
came
And
they're
nothing
-
But
with
it
on
our
side...
Are
you?
On
our
side?
I
don't
think
it's
that
simple.
BARTON:
Well,
it
better
I
am
on
the
side
of
life.
Ultron
isn't.
He
will
end
it
all.
STARK:
What's
he
waiting
for?
-
You.
BARTON:
Sokovia.
He's
got
Nat
there,
too.
If
we're
wrong
about
you,
if
you're
the
monster
What
will
you
do?
I
don't
want
to
kill
Ultron.
He's
unique
and
he's
in
pain.
But
that
pain
will
roll
over
the
Earth.
So,
he
must
be
destroyed.
Every
form
he's
built,
We
have
to
act
now.
And
not
one
of
us
Maybe
I
am
a
monster.
I
don't
think
I'd
know
if
I
were
one.
I'm
not
what
you
are,
and
not
what
you
intended.
So,
there
may
be
no
way
But
we
need
to
go.
Right.
Well
done.
Three
minutes.
Get
what
you
need.
FRIDAY:
Good
evening,
boss.
STARK:
No
way
we
all
get
through
this.
If
even
one
tin
soldier
There's
gonna
be
blood
on
the
floor.
I
got
no
plans
tomorrow
night.
STARK:
I
get

crack
at
the
big
guy.
Iron
Man's
the
one
he's
waiting
for.
That's
true.
He
hates
you
the
most.
ROGERS:
Ultron
knows
we're
coming.
Odds
are
we'll
be
riding
into
heavy
fire.
And
that's
what
we
signed
up
for.
But
the
people
of
Sokovia,
they
didn't.
So
our
priority
is
getting
them
out.
We're
under
attack!
Clear
the
city!
Now!


Get
off
your
asses.
ROGERS:
All
they
want
And
that's
not
gonna
happen
today.
But
we
can
do
our
best
to
protect
them.
And
we
can
get
the
job
done.
We
find
out
what
Ultron's
been
building,
we
find
Romanoff,
and
we
clear
the
field.
Keep
the
fight
between
us.
Ultron
thinks
we're
monsters.
That
we're
what's
wrong
with
the
world.
This
isn't
just
about
beating
him.
It's
about
whether
he's
right.
BANNER:
Natasha!
Natasha!
Bruce?
You
all
right?
Yeah.
The
team
is
in
the
city.
I
don't
suppose
you
found
Yeah.
I
did.

So
what's
our
play?
I'm
here
to
get
you
to
safety.
-
Job's
not
finished.
but
I
can't
be
in
a
fight
near
civilians.
And
you've
done
plenty.
Our
fight
is
over.
So,
we
just
disappear?

-

FRIDAY:
Your
man's
I
think
he's
waiting
for
you.
ULTRON:
Come
to
confess
your
sins?
I
don't
know.
How
much
time
you
got?
ULTRON:
More
than
you.
Uh...
Have
you
been
juicing?
You're
looking...
You're
stalling
to
protect
the
people.
Well,
that
is
the
mission.
Did
you
forget?
I've
moved
beyond
What?
You
think
you
were
FRIDAY:
There's
the
rest
Function,
still
unclear.
ULTRON:
This
is
how
you
end,
Tony.
This
is
peace
in
my
time.


Go!
WANDA:
Get
off
the
bridge!

Run!

VISION:
Ultron.
My
Vision.
They
really
did
take
everything
from
me.
You
set
the
terms.
All
right.



Friday,
the
Vision?
FRIDAY:
Boss,
it's
working.
He
won't
escape
through
there.

ULTRON:
You
shut
me
out.
You
think
I
care?
You
take
away
my
world,
I
take
away
yours.







Friday.
FRIDAY:
Sokovia
is
going
for
a
ride.

ULTRON:
Do
you
see
the
beauty
of
it?
The
inevitability.
You
rise,
only
to
fall.
You,
Avengers,
you
are
my
meteor.
My
swift
and
terrible
sword.
And
the
earth
will
crack
with
the
weight
of
your
failure.
Purge
me
from
your
computers,
It
means
nothing.
When
the
dust
settles,
the
only
thing
living
in
this
world
will
be
metal.
We
gotta
move.
You're
not
gonna
turn
green?
I've
got
a
compelling
reason
I
adore
you.
But
I
need
the
other
guy.


Let's
finish
the
job.



I
really
hope
this
makes
us
even.

-
Now
go
be
a
hero.
FRIDAY:
The
vibranium
core's
That's
what's
keeping
the
rock
together.
If
it
drops?
Right
now,
the
impact
Once
it
gets
high
enough?
That
building's
not
clear.
The
10th
floor.

Hi.
Okay.
Get
in
the
tub!
FRIDAY:
I
got
airborne,

Cap,
you
got
incoming.
Incoming
already
came
in.

Stark,
you
worry
about
The
rest
of
us
have
one
job,
tear
these
things
apart.
You
get
hurt,
hurt
them
back.
You
get
killed,
walk
it
off.


-

Go,
go,
go!
WANDA:
How
could
I
let
this
happen?
-
Hey,
hey,
you
okay?
Hey,
look
at
me.
Who
cares?
Are
you
up
for
this?
Are
you?
Look,
I
just
need
to
know.
Because
the
city
is
flying.
Okay.
Look,
the
city
is
flying,
we're
fighting
an
army
of
robots,
and
I
have
a
bow
and
arrow.
None
of
this
makes
sense.

But
I'm
going
back
out
there
Okay?
And
I
can't
do
my
job
and
babysit.
It
doesn't
matter
If
you
go
out
there,
you
fight,
Stay
in
here,
you're
good.
But
if
you
step
out
that
door,
you
are
an
Avenger.
All
right.
Good
chat.
Yeah,
the
city
is
flying.

ROGERS:
I
got
you!
Just
look
at
me!

ULTRON:
You
can't
save
them
all.
You'll
never...
"Never"
what?
You
didn't
finish!
What,
were
you
napping?


Thor.
You're
bothering
me.
Ow!


All
right,
we're
all
clear
here.
ROGERS:
We
are
not
clear!
We
are
very
not
clear!

All
right,
coming
to
you.
-
PIETRO:
Keep
up,
old
man!
Nobody
would
know.
Nobody.
"The
last
I
saw
him,
"Yeah,
he'll
be
missed,
"I
miss
him
already."
Hold
your
fire!
Romanoff!
Thanks!

FRIDAY:
The
anti-gravs
Touch
them,
they'll
go
The
city's
not
coming
down
slow.
Spire
is
vibranium.
If
I
get
Thor
to
hit
it...
It
will
crack.
That's
not
enough.
The
impact
would
still
be
devastating.
STARK:
Maybe
if
we
can
Keep
the
atomic
action
doubling
back.
FRIDAY:
That
could
vaporise
the
city.
And
everyone
on
it.

ROGERS:
The
next
wave
-
What
do
you
got,
Stark?
Maybe
a
way
to
blow
up
the
city.
That'll
keep
it
if
you
guys
can
get
clear.
I
asked
for
a
solution,
STARK:
Impact
radius
We're
gonna
have
to
make
a
choice.
ROMANOFF:
Cap,
-
If
Stark
finds
a
way
to
blow
this
rock...
Everyone
up
here
versus
everyone
I'm
not
leaving
this
rock
I
didn't
say
we
should
leave.
There's
worse
ways
to
go.
Where
else
am
I
gonna
get
FURY
ON
RADIO:
Glad
It's
about
to
get
better.

FURY:
Nice,
right?
Pulled
her
out
of
mothballs
She's
dusty,
but
she'll
do.
Fury,
you
son
of
a
bitch.
Ooh!
You
kiss
your
mother
Altitude
is
18,000
and
climbing.
Lifeboats
secure
to
deploy.
Disengage
in
three,
two...
Take
them
out.
This
is
S.H.I.E.L.D.?
This
is
what
S.H.I.E.L.D.

This
is
not
so
bad.
Let's
load
them
up.
Sir,
we
have
multiple
bogies
converging
on
our
starboard
flank.
Show
'em
what
we
got.
You're
up.
Yes!
Now
this
is
gonna
be
a
good
story.
STARK:
Yup.
if
you
live
to
tell
it.
RHODES:

You
think
We
get
through
this,
I'll
hold
your
own.
RHODES:
You
had
to
make
it
weird.

I
got
about
50
to
100
more
Here
we
go.
Here
we
go.
Let's
move.
MALE
OFFICER:
Let's
go,
everyone!
Number
six
boat
is
topped
and
locked...

Or
stocked...
Topped...
It's
full
of
people.

Incoming!
Oh,
God!

ULTRON:
You
think
I
turn
that
key
and
and
it's
still
billions
dead.
Even
you
can't
stop
that.
I
am
Thor,
son
of
Odin,
and
as
long
as
I
am
running
out
of
things
to
say!
VISION:
It's
terribly
well-balanced.
Well,
if
there's
too
much
weight,
STARK:
I
got
it.
Create
a
heat
seal.
I
could...
I
could
supercharge
FRIDAY:
Running
numbers.


FRIDAY:
A
heat
seal
could
work
STARK:
Thor,
I
got
a
plan.
They're
coming
for
the
core.
Rhodey,
get
the
rest
of
the
people
-
On
it.
-
Are
you
good?
Romanoff.
You
and
Banner
better
not
be
ROMANOFF:
Relax,
shellhead.
Not
all
of
us
can
fly.

-
What's
the
drill?
If
Ultron
gets
a
hand
Is
that
the
best
you
can
do?
You
had
to
ask.
This
is
the
best
I
can
do.
This
is
exactly
what
I
wanted.
All
of
you
against
all
of
me.
How
can
you
possibly
hope
to
stop
me?
Well,
like
the
old
man
said...
Together.




You
know,
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight...

They'll
try
to
leave
the
city.
We
can't
let
them,
RHODES:
I'm
on
it.
Oh,
no.
I
didn't
say
you
could
leave.
War
Machine
coming
at
you!
Right...
Okay,
what?
We
gotta
move
out.
You
guys
get
to
the
boats.
I'll
sweep
for
stragglers.
-
What
about
the
core?
It's
my
job.
Nat.
This
way.

Get
the
people
on
the
boats.
I'm
not
going
to
leave
you
here.
I
can
handle
this.
Come
back
for
me
-
Not
before.
You
understand?
You
know,

Go.
FRIDAY:
Boss,
Reroute
everything.
BARTON:
I
know
what
I
need
to
do.
The
dining
room.
If
I
knock
out
that
east
wall,
it'd
make
a
nice
workspace
Put
up
some
baffling.
She
can't
hear
the
kids
running
around.
You
guys
always
eat
BARTON:
No
one
eats
in
a
dining
room.


We
don't
have
a
lot
of
time.
So
get
your
ass
on
a
boat.

Hey,
big
guy.
Sun's
getting
real
low.
ROGERS:
You're
safe
now.
Secure
your
gear,
find
a
seat.
ZRINKA:
Costel!
We
were
in
the
market.
Costel!
STARK:
Thor,
I'm
gonna
-
Is
this
the
last
of
them?
-
Everyone
else
is
on
the
carrier.
we
maybe
don't
walk
away.
Maybe
not.




I
got
no
strings,
so
I
have
fun
I'm
not
tied
up
to
anyone
Come
on.
Time
to
go.

You
didn't
see
that
coming?



ULTRON:
Oh,
for
God's
sake.
-
Zrinka!


No,
no,
I'm
fine.
Fine.
It's
been
a
long
day.
Wanda.
If
you
stay
here,
you'll
die.
I
just
did.
Do
you
know
how
it
felt?

It
felt
like
that.


STARK:
Thor,
on
my
mark.
Now!

ROMANOFF:
Hey,
big
guy.
We
did
it.
The
job
is
finished.
Now
I
need
you
to
turn
We
can't
track
you
in
stealth
mode.
So
help
me
out.
I
need
you...
You're
afraid.
Of
you?
Of
death.
You're
the
last
one.
You
were
supposed
to
be
the
last.
Stark
asked
for
a
saviour
and
settled
for
a
slave.
I
suppose
we
are
both
disappointments.

I
suppose
we
are.
Humans
are
odd.
They
think
order
and
chaos
and
try
to
control
what
won't
be.
But
there
is
grace
in
their
failings.
I
think
you
missed
that.
They're
doomed.
Yes.
But
a
thing
isn't
beautiful
It's
a
privilege
to
be
among
them.
You're
unbearably
naive.
Well...
I
was
born
yesterday.

LAURA:
Look!
Say
hi
to
Auntie
Nat!
Fat.
FURY:
One
of
our
tech
boys
Splashed
down
in
the
Banda
Sea.
Could
be
the
Quinjet.
But
with
Stark's
stealth
tech,
we
still
can't
track
the
damn
thing.
Right.
Probably
jumped
out
and
swam
to
Fiji.
He'll
send
a
postcard.
"Wish
you
were
here."
You
sent
me
to
recruit
him
Did
you
know
then
You
never
know.
You
hope
for
the
best,
I
got
a
great
team.
Nothing
lasts
forever.
Trouble,
Ms.
Romanoff.
No
matter
who
wins
or
loses,
ROGERS:
The
rules
have
changed.
STARK:
We're
dealing
Oh,
the
Vision
is
artificial
intelligence.
-
A
machine.
No,
it's
not
like
Right,
different
rules
for
us.
-
Nice
guy.
Artificial.
He
can
wield
the
hammer,
It's
safe
with
the
Vision.
And
these
days,
safe
is
in
short
supply.
But
if
you
put
the
hammer
-
It
would
still
go
up.
I'm
gonna
miss
these
little
talks
of
ours.
Not
if
you
don't
leave.
I
have
no
choice.
The
Mind
Stone
to
show
up
in
the
last
few
years.
It's
not
a
coincidence.
Someone
has
been
playing
and
has
made
pawns
of
us.
And
once
all
these
pieces
Triple
Yahtzee.
You
think
you
can
find
out
I
do.
Besides
this
one,
there's
nothing
that
can't
be
explained.
That
man
has
no
regard
I'm
gonna
miss
him,
though.
There's
gonna
be
a
lot
of
manful
tears.
-

I
will
miss
you,
Tony.
Yeah?
Well,
it's
time
for
me
to
tap
out.
Maybe
I
should
Build
Pepper
a
farm,
The
simple
life.
-
You'll
get
there
one
day.
Family,
stability...
The
guy
who
wanted
all
that
I
think
someone
else
came
out.
You
all
right?

I'm
home.
You
wanna
keep
staring
at
the
wall,
I
mean,
it's
a
pretty
interesting
wall.
I
thought
you
and
Tony
How
do
we
look?
Well,
we're
not
the
'27
Yankees.
We
got
some
hitters.
They're
good.
They're
not
a
team.
Let's
beat
them
into
shape.
Avengers...
THANOS:
Fine.
I'll
do
it
myself.
