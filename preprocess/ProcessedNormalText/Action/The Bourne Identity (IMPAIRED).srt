You
have
that
picture,
you
have
the
$20,000.
You
teII
them
everything
that
happened.
They
have
to
believe
you.
Marie,
you
can't
just
sit
here.
MARIE:
Safe?
-Who
can
do
this?
This
is
from
yesterday.
MARIE:
How
can
they
know
we're
together?
BOURNE:
That's
aII.
How'II
you
make
this
right
You
think
I
want
you
to
go
to
the
cops?
-You
want
to
go,
fine.
-You
teII
them
what
happened!
I
don't
know
who
this
guy
was
I
don't
know
who
I
am!
Look,
I'm....
You
think
I'm
trying
to
burn
you.
Nobody
does
the
right
thing.
Look,
I
can't
run
with
you.
I
can't.
We
run,
I
got
to
Iive
Iike
this.
I
got
to....
These
peopIe
know
who
I
am.
Yeah,
I
got

stay
here.
So
figure
it
out.
You

What

Last

BOURNE:
So....
MARIE:
What?

Turn
your
head
away.
Turn
your
head
away.

We
can
never
come
back
to
this
car.
You
understand?
Okay,
we're
gonna
cIean
it
out,
-That's
it.
Okay.
And
I'II
find
a
pIace
for
us
to
rest.
Do
you
have
a
hat
or
a

or
something?
-For
my

Yeah.
Sure.
Okay.
Okay.
HOFFENMEIN
MORGUE
-
PARIS,
FRANCE


It's
not
him.
This
man
was
not
shot.

CONKLIN:
What
do
you
have?
NICKY:
Wombosi
went
to
the
morgue.
He
saw
the
body.
He
didn't
buy
it.
Where
is
he
now?
NICKY:
I
told
you,
I'm
not
staffed
for
this.
CONKLIN:
Where
is
he?
Right
now!
NICKY:
They
were
leaving
the
morgue.
They
just
Ieft.
ZORN:
Sir,
what
do
you
want
to
do?

I
need
to
get
the
bottIe.
BOURNE:
Hey.
You
aIready
cIeaned
the
room?
I
wiped
the
whoIe
pIace
down
Can
I
waIk
around
You
can
waIk
around.
It's
no
probIem.
But
we'll
just
keep
track
I
think
it's
best
if
we
Ieave
a
room,
Why?
Where
are
we
going?
BOURNE:
I
need
to
go
to
the
hoteI
The
HoteI
Regina.
If
I
was
him,
We
need
that
hotel
bill.
MARIE:
Okay.
It
gets
sIightIy
compIicated,
though.
Because
you're
dead.
BOURNE:
Right.
BODYGUARD:
PIease.
If
they
want
to
kiII
me,
They
better
kiII
me
dead.
BODYGUARD:
Listen
to
me.
It's
hard
enough
getting
peopIe
BODYGUARD:
We
must
be
carefuI.
We?
No,
you.
You
need
to
bring
me
back
...put
it
in
front
of
this
house,
But
that
is
preciseIy--
BODYGUARD:
Nykwana!

BOURNE:
We'II
give
the
watch
MARIE:
Okay.
What's
the
pay
phone
number?
MARIE:
616-2468.
Exits?
There's
three.
Service
at
the
back,
...front
is
the
best.
If
I
think
I'm
being
foIIowed,
I
waIk
out
And
if
there's
no
taxi?
I
keep
on
waIking,
MARIE:
What?
We
need
this,
right?
Okay.

BOURNE:

I
need
distances.
You
walk
in,
you
pick
a
spot.
Count
your
steps
to
that
spot,
Because
after
I
call
you,
You
understand?
I
also
need
a
head
count.
How
many
people
from
when
you
walk
in
How
many
hotel
employees
are
there?
And
it
might
not
be
that
easy
So
I'll
call
you,
you
give
me
the
layout,

OPERATOR:
Regina.
Yes,
the

in
the
Iobby.


BOURNE:
What
happened?
BOURNE:
Did
something
go
wrong?
He,
this
guy
at

So
I
thought,
you

this

BOURNE:
You

You
just
asked

it?
I
said
I
was
Mr.
Kane's
personaI
assistant.
BOURNE:
Okay.
That's
good
thinking.
ZORN:
Sir,
can
I--
ABBOTT:
Wombosi
was
assassinated
Yeah,
we
just
heard.
It's
him.
It's
Bourne.
We're
almost
positive.
He
had
an
assignment.
He
faiIed.
He
obviousIy
feIt
compeIIed
ABBOTT:
Jesus.
CONKLIN:
We
think
he'II
come
back
in
now.
I
mean,
it's
routine.
It's
like
behavioral
software.
He's
foIIowing
a
protocoI.
Now
that
he's
compIeted
the
mission,
They
always
do.
When?
ABBOTT:
How
Iong
tiII
he
checks
in?
ZORN:
24
hours.
Yeah,
it's
usuaIIy
something
Iike
that.
ABBOTT:
Then
what?
I
toId
you
we'd
cIean
this
up.
It
wiII
be
cIean.
BOURNE:

ATTENDANT:

This

They
came
yesterday
evening...his

He's
not

Who
are
you?
What's
going

-Where's
the
body
that
goes
in
here?
I
know.
Where'd
they
take
the
body?
Look,
this
is
not
a

okay?
People
call,
they
make
an
appointment,
Everyone
signs

out.
-It's

BOSS:
Get

BOURNE:
Fine.
I'm

BOURNE:

Wombosi

Kane.
See?
MARIE:
So?
BOURNE:
Same
guy.
This
guy
knows.


My
French
sucks.
I
can't....
I
don't

What
does

say?
It

3
weeks
before
he
was
kiIIed,
...that
a
man
came
onto
his
yacht,
...and
tried
to
kiII
him.
It
says
that
he
chased
the
man
off
the
boat
It
says
I'm
an
assassin.

So
try
this:
I'm
gone.
Fuck.

CONKLIN:
Get
Nicky
on
the
phone.

NICKY:
Yeah?
CONKLIN:
How
long
to
wipe
down
the
room
NICKY:
Get
rid
of
everything?
NICKY:
Two
to
three
hours.
Listen,
no
breaks.
Two
men
outside,
one
in
the
lobby.
COP
1
:
Keep
the
truck?
I'm
gonna
cIose
this
unit
down.
NICKY:
Yes,
aII
IocaI
poIice
radio
traffic.
No,
for
northern
Europe
Okay,
they're
on
it.
We'II
have



CONKLIN:
Where's
your
fieId
box?
-Where's
your
fieId
box?
NICKY:
The
whoIe
system's
gone
haywire.
That's
this
window
right
here.
Dining
room
window?
I
don't
get
it.
Dead.
The
phones
are
dead.
It's
Bourne,
isn't
it?
Just
quiet.
You
move,
you
die.
CONKLIN:
Bourne.
Gun
down.
In
there.
Okay,
so
what
do
you
want--
BOURNE:
Treadstone.
You
better
take
a
Iook
around.
-Are
you
Treadstone?
What
the
heII
are
you
taIking
about?
He's
lost
it.
You
better
start
fiIIing
in
the
bIanks
here!
Whose
side
is
that?
You
don't
know
what
you're
doing,
do
you?
Who
am
I?
You're
U.S.
government
property!
You're
a
maIfunctioning
$30
miIIion
weapon!
You're
a
totaI
goddamn
catastrophe!
And,
by
God,
if
it
kiIIs
me,
-Why
are
you
trying
to
kiII
me?
You
sent
me
to
kiII
Wombosi.
KiII
Wombosi?
I
can
send
Nicky
to
do
that,
Mr.
Wombosi
was
supposed
to
be
dead
He
was
supposed
to
have
died
in
a
way
...that
he'd
been
murdered
I
don't
send
you
to
kiII.
I
send
you
to
be
invisibIe.
I
send
you
because
you
don't
exist.
I
want
to
know
what
happened
in
Marseilles.
I
don't
remember
what
happened
BuIIshit!
This
is
unacceptabIe,
soIdier.
You
hear
me?
You
faiIed!
-UnacceptabIe?
-You
faiIed
and
you're
gonna
teII
me
why!
You
brought
Kane
to
Iife.
You
found
the
security
company.
For
Christ's
sake,
you
picked
the
yacht
CONKLIN:

You
picked
the
boat.
You
picked
the
day.
You
tracked
the
crew.
The
food,
the
fuel!
You
told
us
where.
You
told
us
when.
You
hid
out
on
that
boat
five
days.
You
were
in,
Jason.
You
were
in!
It
was
over!




CONKLIN:
No,
you
do
remember.
Don't
you?
I
don't
want
to
do
this
anymore.
I
don't
think
that's
a
decision
you
can
make.
Jason
Bourne
is
dead.
Do
you
hear
me?
BOURNE:
He
drowned
two
weeks
ago.
You're
gonna
go
teII
them
Bourne
is
dead.
CONKLIN:
Where
are
you
gonna
go?
I
swear,
if
I
even
feeI
somebody
behind
me,
...and
how
hard
I
will
bring
this
fight
I'm
on
my
own
side
now.



It's
done.
Shut
it
down.

ABBOTT:
The
Treadstone
project
It
was
designed
primarily
We'd
hoped
it
might
build
But
quite
honestly,
...the
cost-benefit
ratio
was
just
too
high.
It's
all
but
decommissioned
at
this
point.
MARSHALL:
AII
right,
what's
next?
ABBOTT:
Okay,
this
is...
...Blackbriar.
Blackbriar
is
a
joint
DOD
...that
we
really
feel
has
good
traction
to
it.
It
combines
elements
of
proactive
BOURNE:
This
your
store?
MARIE:
Yeah.
It's
nice.
It's
a
IittIe
hard
to
find,
but....
Think
I
couId
rent
a
scooter?
You
have
ID?
Not
reaIIy.
