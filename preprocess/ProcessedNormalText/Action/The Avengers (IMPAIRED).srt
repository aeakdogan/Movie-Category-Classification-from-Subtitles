I
gave

this

so
you
could
keep
Well,
I

Have
you

BARTON:
No

And
Selvig's

No

If
there
was
any

Yeah,
the

is

to
Doors

Not

Sir,
please
put
down
the
spear.







You
have
heart.

LOKI:
Please
don't.
I
still
need
that.
This
doesn't
have
to
get
any
messier.
LOKI:
Of
course
it
does.
I've
come
too
far
for
anything
else.
I
am
Loki,
of
Asgard
and
I
am
burdened
with
Loki,
brother
of
Thor.
We
have
no
quarrel
with
your
people.
An
ant
has
no
quarrel
with

Are
you
planning
to
step
on
us?
I
come
with
glad
tidings
of
a
world
made
free.
Free
from
what?
Freedom.
Freedom
is
life's
great
lie.
Once
you
accept
that,
in
your
heart,

you
will
know
peace.
Yeah,
you
say
"peace,"
I
kind
of
think
you
mean
the
other
thing.
Sir,
Director
Fury
is
stalling.
This
place
is
about
to
blow
and
drop
a
hundred
feet
of
rock
on
us.
He
means
to
bury
us.
Like
the

of

SELVIG:
He's
right.

No,

Go!
We're

sir.



COULSON
ON

Director?
Director
Fury,
do
you
copy?
The
Tesseract
is
with
a
hostile
force.
I
have

down.
Hill?
A
lot
of
men
still
under.
I
don't

Coulson,

As
of

now,
we
are
at

What
do
we
do?


This
is
not
how
I
wanted
this

I
know
how
you
wanted
this

Believe
me
this
is
better.
Who
are
you
working
for?
Lermentov,
yes?
Does
he
think
we
have

Well...

may
have
to

It's
for

You
listen
carefully
COULSON:

Put
the

We

This
takes
precedence.
I'm
in
the

of
an
interrogation.
This

is
giving

everything.
I
don't
give

Look,
you

Natasha...
Barton's
been
compromised.
Let
me
put
you

ROMANOFF:
Where
is
Barton
now?
-
We
don't
know.
We
think
so.
I'll
brief

on
But
first,
we
need
you

you
know
that

Oh,

Stark.
You

Who
are
you?
Get
out!
There
is
sickness
here!
You're
a
doctor.

My
father's
not
waking
up!
He
has
a
fever
and
he's
moaning
but
his
eyes
won't

Slow
down.
My

Like
them?

Please.

You

ROMANOFF:
You
know,
for
a
man
who's
supposed
to
be
avoiding
stress
you
picked
a
hell
of
a
place
to
settle.
Avoiding
stress
isn't
the
secret.
Then
what
is
it?
Yoga?
You
brought
me
to
the
edge
of
I
assume
the
whole
place
Just
you
and
me.
And
your
actress
buddy?
Is
she
a
spy,
too?
I
did.
Who
are
you?
Natasha
Romanoff.
Are
you
here
to
kill
me,
Ms.
Romanoff?
Because
that's
not
going
to
No,
of
course
not.
I'm
here
S.H.I.E.L.D.
How
did
they
find
me?
We
never
lost
you,
Doctor.
We've
kept
our
distance.
Even
helped
keep
some
other
off
your
scent.
Why?
Nick
Fury
seems
to
trust
you.
But
now
we
need
you
to
come
in.
What
if
I
say
no?
I'll
persuade
you.
And
what
if
the
other
guy
says
no?
You've
been
more
than
a
year
I
don't
think
you
want
to
Well,
I
don't
every
time
get
what
I
want.
Doctor,
we're
facing
a
potential

Well,
This
is
the
Tesseract.
It
has
the
potential
energy
What
does
Fury
want
me
to
do,
He
wants
you
to
find
it.
It's
been
taken.
It
emits
a
gamma
signature
There's
no
one
that
knows
If
there
was,
that's
where
I'd
be.
So,
Fury
isn't
after
the
monster?
Not
that
he's
told
me.
And
he
tells
you
everything?
Talk
to
Fury.
He
needs
you
on
this.
He
needs
me
in
a
cage?
No
one's
going
to
put
you
in
a...
Stop
lying
to
me!

I'm
sorry.
That
was
mean.
I
just
wanted
to
see
what
you'd
do.
Why
don't
we
do
this
the
easy
way
where
you
don't
use
that
and
the
other
guy
Okay?
Natasha?
Stand
down.
We're
good
here.
"Just
you
and
me."
This
is
out

You're

His

away.
We
can't

on

either.
It's

Which
is
why
you
It
was

for

this...
Phase
2

Our
enemy
is.
We
need
a

team.
The
Avengers
Initiative
was
shut
down.
This
isn't
about
the
Avengers.
We've
seen
the
list.
You're
running
the
world's
greatest
and
you're
going
to
leave
to
a
handful
of
freaks.
I'm
not
leaving
anything
to
anyone.
We
need
a
response
team.
These
people
may
be
isolated,
but
I
believe
with
the
right
push
You
believe?
War
isn't
won
by
sentiment,
Director.
No,
it's
won
by
soldiers.

ROGERS:
There's
not
enough

I

PEGGY:

DOCTOR:
Oh,
my
God.
This

is
still
alive!

Trouble
sleeping?
I
slept
for
70
years,
sir.
Then
you
should
be
out,
When
I
went
under,
I
wake
up,
they
say
we
won.
They
didn't
say
what
we
lost.
We've
made
some
mistakes
Some,
very
recently.
Are
you
here
with
a
mission,
sir?
I
am.
Trying
to

back
in

Trying
to
save
it.
ROGERS:

FURY:
Howard

for

He

what
we

could
be
the
key
That's
something
Who
took
it
from
you?
He's
called
Loki.
He's
not
from
around
here.
There's
a
lot
we'll
have
to
if
you're
in.
The
world
has
gotten
even
stranger
than
you
already
know.
At
this
point,
I
doubt
Ten

says
you're
wrong.
There's
a
debriefing
packet
waiting
for
you
back
at
your
apartment.
Is
there
anything
you
can
that
we
ought
to
know

in

Well,
I

No,

Please.

An

nicely.
So,
how
long
am
I
staying?
Once
we
get
our
hands
on
you're
in
the
wind.
Where
are
you
with
that?
We're
sweeping
every
camera
on
the
planet.
Cell
phones,
laptops...
If
it's
connected
to
a
satellite,
That's
still
not
gonna
find
them
in
time.
BANNER:
You
have
to
narrow
your
field.
How
many
spectrometers
-
How
many
are
there?
Tell
them
to
put
and
calibrate
them
for
gamma
rays.
I'll
rough
out
a
tracking
algorithm,
At
least
we
could
rule
out
a
few
places.
Do
you
have
somewhere
Agent
Romanoff,
could
you
show
Dr
Banner
You're
gonna
love
it,
Doc.
Put
it
over
there.
(SCIENTISTS
Where
did
you
find
all
these
people?
S.H.I.E.L.D.
has
no
shortage
Is
this
the
stuff
you
need?
Yeah,
iridium.
It's
found
in
meteorites.
It's
very
hard
to
get
hold
of.
Especially
if
S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well,
I
didn't
know.
Hey!
The
Tesseract
has
shown
me
so
much.
It's
more
than
knowledge.
It's
truth.
I
know.
What
did
it
show
you,
Agent
Barton?
My
next
target.
LOKI:
Tell
me
what
you
need.
I
need
a
distraction.
And
an
eyeball.
I
mean,
if
it's
not
too
much
trouble.
No,
no.
It's
fine.
It's
a
vintage
set.
It
took
me
a
couple
of
years
Near
mint.
Slight
foxing
around
the
edges,
but...
We
got
a
hit.
A
67%
match.
Wait.
Cross
match,
79%.
COULSON:
Location?
AGENT:
Stuttgart,
Germany.
He's
not
exactly
hiding.
FURY:
Captain,
you're
up.









(PANICKED
SCREAMING


LOKI:
Kneel
before
me.
I
said

kneel!
ls
not
this
simpler?
Is
this
not
your
natural
state?
It's
the
unspoken
truth
of
humanity,
that
you
crave
subjugation.
The
bright
lure
of
freedom
in
a
mad
scramble
for
power,
for
identity.
You
were
made
to
be
ruled.
In
the
end,
you
will
always
kneel.
Not
to
men
like
you.
There
are
no
men
like
me.
There
are
always
men
like
you.
Look
to
your
elder,
people.
Let
him
be
an
example.

You
know,
the
last
time
and
saw
a
man
standing
we
ended
up
disagreeing.
The
soldier.
The
man
out
of
time.
I'm
not
the
one
who's
out
of
time.
ROMANOFF
ON
PA:
Loki,
drop




Kneel.
-
Not
today!
The
guy's
all
over
the
place.

STARK:
Agent
Romanoff.


Make
your
move,
Reindeer
Games.
Good
move.
Mr
Stark.
Captain.
FURY
ON
RADIO:
Not
a
word.
Just
get
him
here.
We're
low
on
time.
I
don't
like
it.
STARK:
What,
Rock
of
Ages
I
don't
remember
it
being
that
easy.
This
guy
packs
a
wallop.
Still,
you
are
pretty
spry
What's
your
thing,
Pilates?
What?
It's
like
calisthenics.
You
might
have
missed
doing
time
as
a
Capsicle.
Fury
didn't
tell
me
Yeah,
there's
a
lot
of
things
-
What's
the
matter?
Are
you
I'm
not
overly
fond
of
what
follows.

ROGERS:
What
are
you
doing?


And
now
there's
that
guy.
Another
Asgardian?
-
That
guy's
a
friendly?
If
he
frees
Loki
or
kills
him,
Stark,
we
need
a
plan
of
attack!
I
have
a
plan.
Attack.
I'd
sit
this
one
out,
Cap.
I
don't
see
how
I
can.
These
guys
come
from
legend.
There's
only
one
God,
ma'am.
And
I'm
pretty
sure


Where
is
the
Tesseract?
I
missed
you,
too.
Do
I
look
to
be
in
a
gaming
mood?
You
should
thank
me.
With
the
Bifrost
gone,
did
the
Allfather
have
to
to
your
precious
Earth?

I
thought
you
dead.
Did
you
mourn?
We
all
did.
Our
father...
Your
father.
He
did
tell
you
We
were
raised
together.
We
played
together,
Do
you
remember
none
of
that?
I
remember
a
shadow.
Living
in
the
shade
of
your
greatness.
I
remember
you
tossing
me
I,
who
was,
and
should
be,
king!
So
you
take
the
world
I
love
for
your
imagined
slights?
No.
The
Earth
is
under

And
you're
doing
The
humans
slaughter
while
you
idly
fret.
I
mean
to
rule
them,
You
think
yourself
above
them?
Well,
yes.
Then
you
miss
the
truth
A
throne
would
suit
you
ill.
I've
seen
worlds
I
have
grown,
Odinson,
in
my
exile.
I
have
seen
the
true
power
and
when
I
Wield
it...
Who
showed
you
this
power?
Who
controls
the
would-be
king?
-
I
am
a
king!
You
give
up
the
Tesseract!
You
give
up
this
poisonous
dream!
You
come
home.
I
don't
have
it.
You
need
the
Cube
to
bring
me
home.
But
I've
sent
it
off,
I
know
not
where.
You
listen
well,
brother.

I'm
listening.

Do
not
touch
me
again.
Then
don't
take
my
stuff.
You
have
no
idea
Shakespeare
in
the
Park?
Doth
Mother
know
This
is
beyond
you,
metal
man.
Loki
will
face
Asgardian
justice.
He
gives
up
the
Cube,
stay
out
of
the
way.
-
Tourist.

Okay.




JARVIS:
Power
at
400%
capacity.
How
about
that?


-





ROGERS:
Hey!
That's
enough.
Now,
I
don't
know
I've
come
here
to
put
an
end
Then
prove
it.
Put
that
hammer
down.
Yeah...
No.
Bad
call.
He
loves
his
hammer.

You
want
me
to
put
the
hammer
down?


Are
we
done,
here?
-
In
case
it's
unclear,
if
you
try
to
escape,
if
you
so
much
as
scratch
that
glass,

it's
30,000
feet
straight
down
You
get
how
that
works?
Ant,
boot.

It's
an
impressive
cage.
Not
built,
I
think,
for
me.
Built
for
something
Oh,
I've
heard.
A
mindless
beast.
Makes
play
he's
still
a
man.
How
desperate
are
you,
that
you
call
on
such
FURY:
How
desperate
am
I?
You
threaten
my
world
with
war.
You
steal
a
force
You
talk
about
peace,
You
have
made
me
very
desperate.
You
might
not
be
glad
that
you
did.
Ooh.
It
burns
you
to
have
come
so
close.
To
have
the
Tesseract,
to
have
power,
unlimited
power.
And
for
what?
A
warm
light
for
all
mankind
to
share.
And
then
to
be
reminded
Well,
let
me
know
if
"real
power"
He
really
grows
on
you,
doesn't
he?
Loki's
gonna
drag
this
out.
So,
Thor,
what's
his
play?
He
has
an
army
called
the
Chitauri.
They're
not
of
Asgard,
He
means
to
lead
them
They
Will
Win
him
the
Earth,
in
return,
I
suspect,
for
the
Tesseract.
An
army
from
outer
space.
So,
he's
building
another
portal.
That's
what
he
needs
Erik
Selvig
for.
Selvig?
-
He's
an
astrophysicist.
Loki
has
him
under
some
kind
of
spell,
along
with
one
of
ours.
I
want
to
know
why
Loki
let
us
take
him.
He's
not
leading
an
army
from
here.
I
don't
think
That
guy's
brain
is
a
bag
full
of
cats.
You
could
smell
crazy
on
him.
Have
care
how
you
speak.
Loki
is
beyond
reason,
And
he
is
my
brother.
He
killed
80
people
in
two
days.
He's
adopted.
I
think
it's
about
the
mechanics.
Iridium...
What
do
they
It's
a
stabilising
agent.
I'm
just
saying,
pick
a
weekend.
I'll
fly
you
to
Portland.
Keep
love
alive.
It
means
the
portal
like
it
did
at
S.H.I.E.L.D.
No
hard
feelings,
Point
Break.
Also,
it
means
the
portal
and
stay
open
as
long,
as
Loki
wants.
Raise
the
mizzenmast.
Jib
the
topsails.
That
man
is
playing
Galaga.
He
thought
we
wouldn't
notice,
How
does
Fury
even
see
these?
He
turns.
Sounds
exhausting.
The
rest
of
the
raw
materials,
Agent
Barton
can
get
The
only
major
component
is
a
power
source
Something
to
kick-start
the
Cube.
When
did
you
become
an
expert
Last
night.
The
packet,
Selvig's
notes,
Am
I
the
only
one
who
did
the
reading?
Does
Loki
need
any
particular
He
would
have
to
heat
the
Cube
just
to
break
through
Unless
Selvig
has
figured
out
the
quantum
tunnelling
effect.
BANNER:
Well,
if
he
could
do
that,
he
could
achieve
heavy
ion
fusion
Finally,
someone
who
speaks
English.
Is
that
what
just
happened?
It's
good
to
meet
you,
Dr
Banner.
Your
work
on
antielectron
And
I'm
a
huge
fan
of
the
way
and
turn
into
an
enormous
Thanks.
Dr
Banner
is
only
here
I
was
hoping
you
might
join
him.
ROGERS:
It
may
be
magical,
but
it
works
an
awful
lot
I
don't
know
about
that,
And
I
would
like
to
know
to
turn
two
of
the
sharpest
men
I
know
into
his
personal
flying
monkeys.
Monkeys?
I
do
not
understand.
I
do.
I
understood
that
reference.
Shall
we
play,
Doctor?
This
way,
sir.
The
gamma
readings
with
Selvig's
reports
of
the
Tesseract.
But
it's
going
to
take
weeks
to
process.
If
we
bypass
their
mainframe
and
direct
route
to
the
Homer
cluster,
we
can
clock
this
All
I
packed
was
a
toothbrush.
You
know,
you
should
come
by
Top
ten
floors,
all
R&D.
You'd
love
it.
It's
Candy
Land.
Thanks,
but
the
last
time
I
kind
of
broke
Harlem.
Well,
I
promise
No
tension,
no
surprises.

ROGERS:
Hey!
Are
you
nuts?
Jury's
out.
You
really
have
got
What's
your
secret?
Mellow
jazz,
bongo
drums
Is
everything
a
joke
to
you?
Funny
things
are.
Threatening
the
safety
isn't
funny.
No
of
fence,
Doc.
It's
all
right,
if
I
couldn't
handle
pointy
things.
You're
tip-toeing,
big
man.
And
you
need
to
focus
STARK:
Do
you
think
I'm
not?
Why
did
Fury
call
us
in?
What
isn't
he
telling
us?
I
can't
do
the
equation
unless
You
think
Fury's
hiding
something?
He's
a
spy.
Captain,
he's
"the"
spy.
His
secrets
have
secrets.
It's
bugging
him,
too.
Isn't
it?
Uh...
I
just
want
to
finish
my
work
here,
and...
Doctor?
"A
warm
light
for
all
mankind."
Loki's
jab
at
Fury
about
the
Cube.
I
heard
it.
I
think
that
was
meant
for
you.
Even
if
Barton
didn't
it
was
still
all
over
the
news.
The
Stark
Tower?
That
big,
ugly
building
in
New
York?
It's
powered
by
an
arc
reactor,
That
building
will
run
itself
It's
just
the
prototype.
I'm
kind
of
the
only
name
That's
what
he's
getting
at.
So,
why
didn't
S.H.I.E.L.D.
bring
him
in
What
are
they
doing
in
the
first
place?
I
should
probably
look
into
that
finishes
breaking
into
all
of
I'm
sorry.
Did
you
say...
Jarvis
has
been
running
it
In
a
few
hours,
S.H.I.E.L.D.
has
ever
tried
to
hide.
Blueberry?
Yet
you're
confused
about
why
An
intelligence
organisation
Historically,
not
awesome.
I
think
Loki's
trying
to
wind
us
up.
This
is
a
man
who
means
to
start
a
war
and
if
we
don't
stay
focused,
We
have
orders.
Following's
not
really
my
style.
And
you're
all
about
style,
aren't
you?
Of
the
people
in
this
room,
which
one
is,
and,
B,
not
of
use?
Steve,
tell
me
none
of
this
Just
find
the
Cube.

STARK:
That's
the
guy
I'm
wondering
if
they
shouldn't
have
Huh.
The
guy's
not
wrong
about
Loki.
He
does
have
the
jump
on
us.
What
he's
got
is
an
Acme
dynamite
kit.
It's
going
to
blow
up
in
his
face.
And
I'm
going
to
be
there
when
it
does.
Yeah.
I'll
read
all
about
it.
Uh-huh.
Or
you'll
be
suiting
up

You
see,
I
don't
get
a
suit
of
armour.
I'm
exposed.
Like
a
nerve.
It's
a
nightmare.
I've
got
a
cluster
of
shrapnel
to
crawl
its
way
into
my
heart.
This
stops
it.
This
little
circle
of
light,
not
just
armour.
It's
a
terrible
privilege.
-
But
you
can
control
it.
It's
different.
Hey,
I
read
all
about
your
accident.
That
much
gamma
exposure
So
you're
saying
that
the
Hulk...
The
other
guy
saved
my
life?
That's
nice.
It's
a
nice
sentiment.
Saved
it
for
what?
I
guess
we'll
find
out.
You
may
not
enjoy
that.
And
you
just
might.



COULSON:
As
soon
we
moved
Jane
Foster.
They've
got
an
excellent
She
was
asked
to
consult
there
Handsome
fee,
private
plane,
She'll
be
safe.
Thank
you.
It's
no
accident,
Loki
taking
Erik
Selvig.
I
dread
what
he
plans
for
him
Erik
is
a
good
man.
He
talks
about
you
a
lot.
You
changed
his
life.
You
changed
everything
around
here.
They
were
better
as
they
were.
We
pretend
on
Asgard
but
we
come
here,
-
Like
what?
You
know,
huge,
scaly,
big
antlers.
-
You
don't
have
those?
Well,
they
are
repulsive.
And
they
trample
everything
When
I
first
came
to
Earth,
and
your
people
paid
the
price.
And
now,
again.
In
my
youth,
I
courted
war.
FURY:
War
hasn't
started
yet.
You
think
you
could
make
Loki
tell
us
where
the
Tesseract
is?
I
do
not
know.
Loki's
mind
is
far
afield.
It's
not
just
power
he
craves,
There's
no
pain
A
lot
of
guys
think
that
until
the
pain
starts.
What
are
you
asking
me
to
do?
I'm
asking,
Loki
is
a
prisoner.
Then
why
do
I
feel
like
that
wants
to
be
here?
There's
not
many
people
But
you
figured
I'd
come.
After.
After
whatever
tortures
you
would
appear
And
I
would
cooperate.
I
want
to
know
what
I
would
say
I've
expanded
his
mind.
And
once
you've
won,
once
you're
king
of
the
mountain,
what
happens
to
his
mind?
Oh...
Is
this
love,
Agent
Romanoff?
Love
is
for
children.
I
owe
him
a
debt.
Tell
me.
Before
I
worked
for
S.H.I.E.L.D...
I,
uh...
Well,
I
made
a
name
for
myself.
I
have
a
very
specific
skill
set.
I
didn't
care
who
I
used
it
for,
or
on.
I
got
on
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
radar
Agent
Barton
was
sent
to
kill
me.
He
made
a
different
call.
And
what
will
you
do
Not
let
you
out.
No,
but
I
like
this.
Your
world
in
the
balance,
Regimes
fall
every
day.
I
tend
not
to
weep
over
that.
Or
I
was.
And
what
are
you
now?
It's
really
not
that
complicated.
I
got
red
in
my
ledger,
Can
you?
Can
you
wipe
out
that
much
red?
Dreykov's
daughter,
São
Paulo,
the
hospital
fire?
Barton
told
me
everything.
Your
ledger
is
dripping.
It's
gushing
red
and
you
think
saving
a
man
will
change
anything?
This
is
the
basest
sentimentality.
This
is
a
child
at
prayer.
Pathetic!
You
lie
and
kill
in
the
service
of
liars
and
killers.
You
pretend
to
be
separate,
something
that
makes
up
But
they
are
part
of
you.
And
they
will
never
go
away.
I
won't
touch
Barton,
Slowly,
intimately,
in
every
way
he
knows
you
fear.
And
then
he'll
wake
just
long
and
when
he
screams,
I'll
split
his
skull.
This
is
my
bargain,
you
mewling
quim.

You're
a
monster.

Oh,
no.
You
brought
the
monster.
So,
Banner.
That's
your
play.
What?

STARK:
I'm
sorry,
Nick.
What
were
you
lying?
I
was
wrong,
Director.
The
world
hasn't
changed
a
bit.
Did
you
know
about
this?
You
want
to
think
about
from
this
environment,
Doctor?
I
was
in
Calcutta.
Loki
is
manipulating
you.
And
you've
been
doing
what,
exactly?
You
didn't
come
here
because
Yes,
and
I'm
not
leaving
because
suddenly
I'd
like
to
know
Why
S.H.I.E.L.D.
is
using
the
Tesseract
Because
of
him.
Me?
Last
year,
Earth

a

who
had

We
learned
that

we
are
hopelessly,
My

you're
not

And
you're
not
the
only

The

Like
you
controlled
the
Cube?
Your
work
with
the
Tesseract
is
what
drew
Loki
to
it,
and
his
allies.
It
is
a
signal
to
all
the
realms
that
the
Earth

forced

hard
on

Thanks.
Natasha...
How
many
agents
did
I...
Don't.
Don't
do
that
to
yourself,
Clint.
This
is
Loki.
This
is
monsters
and
magic,
and
nothing
we
were
ever
trained
for.
Loki,
did
he
get
away?
Yeah.
I
don't
suppose
you
know
where.
I
didn't
need
to
know.
I
didn't
ask.
He's
going
to
Today.
We
got
to
stop
him.
Yeah?
Who's
"we"?
I
don't
know.
Whoever's
left.
Well,
if
I
put
an
arrow
I
would
sleep
better,
I
suppose.
Now
you
sound
like
you.
But
you
don't.
You're
a
spy,
not
a
soldier.
Now
you
want
to
wade
into
a
war.
Why?
What
did
Loki
do
to
you?
He
didn't.
I
just...
Natasha.
I've
been
compromised.
I
got
red
in
my
ledger.
I
would
like
to
wipe
it
out.
Was
he
married?
No.
There
was
a
cellist,
I
think.
I'm
sorry.
He
seemed
like
a
good
man.
He
was
an
idiot.
Why?
For
believing?
For
taking
on
Loki
alone.
He
was
doing
his
job.

He
was
out
of
his
league.
He
should
have...
Sometimes
there
isn't
a

Tony.
Right,
I've

that
before.
Is
this

you
lost
a
soldier?
We
are
not
soldiers.
I'm
not
marching
to
Fury's
fife.
Neither
am
I.
He's
got
the
same
blood
But
right
now,
and
get
this
done.
Loki
needs
a
power
source.
If
we
can
put
together
a
list...
He
made
it
personal.
That's
not
the
point.
That
is
the
point.
That's
Loki's
point.
He
hit
us
all
right
where
we
live.
Why?
To
tear
us
apart.
Yeah,
divide
and
conquer
is
great
but
he
knows
he
has
to
That's
what
he
wants.
He
wants
to
beat
us,
He
wants
an
audience.
Right.
I
caught
his
act
in
Stuttgart.
Yeah,
that
was
just
previews.
And
Loki,
he's
a
full-tilt
diva,
right?
He
wants
flowers,
he
wants
parades.
He
wants
a
monument
built
to
the

thing.
Yes,
I've
met
them.
Yeah.
It
takes
us
a
while
to
get
any
traction,
I'll
give
you
that
one.
But
let's
do
a

count,
here.
Your

the

a
super

a
living

A

with
breathtaking
a

assassins,
you've
managed
to
piss
off
That
was
the
plan.
Not
a
great
plan.
When
they
come,
and
they
will,
they'll
come
for
you.
I
have
an
army.
We
have
a
Hulk.
I
thought
the
beast
had
wandered
off.
You're
missing
the
point.
There
is
no
version
of
this
Maybe
your
army
comes
but
it's
all
on
you.
Because
if
we
can't
protect
the
Earth,
you
can
be
damn
well
sure
How
will
your
friends
have
time
for
me
when
they
are
so
busy
fighting
you?
This
usually
works.

Loki's
going
to
keep
and
that's
what
we
need.
Without
him,
We
got
Stark
up
top.

So,
this
all
seems
horrible.
I've
seen
worse.
Sorry.
No,
we
could
use
a
little
worse.
-
Stark,
we
got
him.
Just
like
you
said.
Then
tell
him
to
suit
up.

I
don't
see
how
that's
a
party.
ROGERS:
Dr
Banner.
Now
might
be
a
really
good
That's
my
secret,
Captain.
I'm
always
angry-
Hold
on!



Send
the
rest.
Guys.
STARK:
Call
it,
Captain.
All
right,
listen
up.
Until
we
can
close
that
portal,
Barton,
I
want
you
on
that
roof.
Eyes
on
everything.
Stark,
you
got
the
perimeter.
Anything
gets
you
turn
it
back
or
you
turn
it
to
ash.
-
Can
you
give
me
a
lift?
Better
clench
up,
Legolas.
Thor,
you
got
to
try
Slow
them
down.
You
got
the
lightning.
You
and
me,
We
keep
the
fighting
here.
And
Hulk...

Smash.

(CHATTER
FROM
Sir.
The
Council
is
on.
Stark,
you
got
a
lot
of
strays
I'm
just
trying
to
keep
them
Well,
they
can't
bank
worth
a
damn.
So
find
a
tight
corner.
I
will
roger
that.
Oh,
boy.
Nice
call.
What
else
you
got?
BARTON:
Thor
is
taking
on
And
he
didn't
invite
me.




Captain,
none
of
this
if
we
don't
close
that
portal.
ROGERS:
Well,
maybe
it's
not
about
guns.
If
you
want
to
get
up
there,
I
got
a
ride.
I
could
use
a
boost,
though.
Are
you
sure
about
this?
Yeah.
It's
gonna
be
fun.

Okay,
turn,
turn.
Less!Less!






BARTON:
Captain,
the
bank
They've
cornered
I'm
on
it.




Everyone!
Clear
out!


COUNCILWOMAN:
Director
Fury,
the
Council
has
made
a
decision.
I
recognise
the
Council
But
given
that
I
have
elected
to
ignore
it.
Director,
you're
closer
You
scramble
that
jet...
That
is
the
island
of
Manhattan,
Until
I'm
certain
my
team
can't
hold
it,
I
will
not
order
a
nuclear
strike
against
a
civilian
population.
If
we
don't
hold
them
here,
If
I
send
that
bird
out,
we
already
have.
Oh,
you.
Hawkeye!
Nat,
what
are
you
doing?
A
little
help?
I
got
him.




Enough!
You
are,
all
of
you,
beneath
me!
I
am
a
god,
you
dull
creature.
And
I
will
not
be
bullied
by...
Puny
god.

SELVIG:
The
sceptre...
Doctor.
Loki's
sceptre.
The
energy.
The
Tesseract
can't
fight,
but
you
can't
protect
against
yourself.
It's
not
your
fault.
You
didn't
know
what
you
were
doing.
Actually,
I
think
I
did.
I
built
in
a
safety
Loki's
sceptre.
It
may
be
able
to
close
the
portal.
And
I'm
looking
right
at
it.

JARVIS:
Sir,
we
will
lose
power
Jarvis,

the
tale
of
Jonah?
JARVIS:

Are
you
ready
for
another
bout?
What,
are
you
getting
sleepy?
Right
at
the
crown!
I
can
close
it.
Can
anybody
copy?
I
can
shut
the
portal
down.
-
Do
it!
Stark,
these
things
are
still
coming.
I
got
a
nuke
coming
in.
It's
gonna
blow
in
less
than
a
minute.
And
I
know
just
where
to
put
it.
ROGERS:
Stark,
Save
the
rest
for
the
turn,
J.
JARVIS:
Sir,
shall
I
try
Miss
Potts?
Might
as
well.
REPORTER:
have
become
a
battleground.
The
Army
is
here
trying
-but
clearly,
it
is
outmatched.
And
I
have
to
say,
I
have
never
seen
anything
like
this.
We
have
limited
information
but
we
do
know
that




Come
on,
Stark.

Close
it.
Son
of
a
gun.
He's
not
slowing
down.
Is
he
breathing?
-

What
the
hell?
What
just
happened?
Please
tell
me
nobody
kissed
me.
We
won.

All
right,
yay!
Hurray.
Good
job,
guys.
Let's
just
not
come
in
tomorrow.
Have
you
ever
tried
shawarma?
There's
a
shawarma
joint
I
don't
know
what
it
is,
We're
not
finished
yet.
And
then
shawarma
after.

If
it's
all
the
same
to
you,
I'll
have
that
drink
now.
Despite
the
devastation
as
an
extraterrestrial
attack,
the
extraordinary
heroics
of
the
group
known
as
the
Avengers
has
been
to
many
a
cause
but
for
celebration.
It's
just
really
great
knowing
That
someone
is
watching
over
us.
I
love
you,
Thor!
And
then
these
guys
were
like...
And
then
the
air
goes...
And
this
green
guy
walks
up
I
don't
know.
I
don't
exactly
feel
safer
It
just
seems
that
there's
Superheroes
in
New
York?
These
so-called
"heroes"
have
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
destruction
done
to
this
city.
This
was
their
fight.
REPORTER:
about
the
Avengers
themselves.
Their
sudden
appearance
and
equally
sudden
disappearance...
WOMAN:
What,
Captain
America
saved
my
life.
Wherever
he
is,
and
I
would
just.
..
I
would
want
to
say
thank
you.
Where
are
the
Avengers?
I'm
not
currently
I'd
say
they've

COUNCILWOMAN:
And
the
Tesseract?
FURY:
Out
of
our

COUNCILMAN
1:
That's
not
your
call.
I
didn't
make
it.
I
just
didn't
argue
with
the
god
that
did.
COUNCILMAN
1:
So,
you
let
him
take
it
and
the
war
criminal,
Loki,
who
should
be
FURY:
Oh,
I

he
Will
be.
COUNCILWOMAN:
I
don't
think
you

They're
dangerous.
FU
RY:
They
surely
are,
Every
world
knows
it.
Was
that
the
point
of
all
this?
A
statement?
FU
RY:
A
promise.
HILL:
Sir,
how
does
it
work
now?
They've
gone
their
separate
ways.
Some,
pretty
extremely
far.
If
we
get
into
a
situation
like
this
again,
what
happens
then?
They'll
come
back.
HILL:
Are
you
really
sure
about
that?
FURY:
lam.
Why?
Because
we'll
need
them
to.

THE
OTHER:
Humans.
They
are
not
the
cowering
They
stand.
They
are
unruly,
To
challenge
them
is
to
court
death.
