me
back,
stupid
S.H.I.E.L.D.
-
What's
S.H.I.E.L.D?
Hey,
Erik,
it's
Darcy
again.
Thor
came
back,
and
I'm
not
sure
NEWSCASTER:
Something
else
when
astrophysicist
Dr.
Erik
Selvig
notable
for
his
involvement
in
streaked
nude
across...
IAN:
Darcy,
you
really
Your
friend,
Erik...
What
was
his
last
name
again?
And
began
shouting
at
visitors
He
was
later
taken
for
psychiatric
evaluation.
Police
are
still
You
were
not
at
Odin's
war
council.
The
Bifrost
is
closed
No
one
is
to
come
or
to
go.
We
face
an
enemy
What
use
is
a
guardian
such
as
that?
Malekith
will
return,
I
need
your
help.
I
cannot
overrule
my
king's
wishes.
I'm
not
asking
you
to.
The
realms
need
their
Allfather
whether
he
is
or
not.
But
he
is
blinded,
Heimdall
by
hatred
and
by
grief.
As
are
we
all.
I
see
clearly
enough.
The
risks
are
too
great.
Everything
we
do
from
There
is
no
other
way.
What
do
you
require
of
me?
THOR:
What
I'm
about
to
ask
of
you
Success
will
bring
us
exile
and
Malekith
knew
the
Aether
was
here.
If
we
do
nothing,
but
this
time,
lay
waste
We
must
move
The
Bifrost
has
been
shut
down
and
the
Tesseract
There
are
other
paths
off
Asgard.
One,
actually.
No.
Thor.
After
all
this
time
and
now
you
come
to
visit
me.
Why?
Have
you
come
to
gloat?
Loki,
enough.
No
more
illusions.
Now
you
see
me,
brother.
Did
she
suffer?
I
did
not
come
here
Instead
I
offer
you
the
chance
Go
on.
I
know
you
seek
vengeance
You
help
me
escape
Asgard
Vengeance
and
afterward,
this
cell.

You
must
be
truly
desperate
What
makes
you
think
I
don't.
Mother
did.
But
you
should
know
that
when
I
did
so
with
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
my
brother
That
hope
no
longer
exists
You
betray
me,
and
I
will
kill
you.
Hmm.
When
do
we
start?
He
will
betray
you.
He
will
try.
This
is
so
unlike
you,
brother.
So
clandestine.
Are
you
sure
you
wouldn't
If
you
keep
speaking,
Fine.
As
you
wish.
I'm
not
even
here.
Is
this
better?
It's
better
company
at
least.
Still,
we
could
be
Mmm,
brother,
you
look
ravishing.
It
will
hurt
no
less
Very
well.
Perhaps
you
given
that
you
seem
Oh,
this
is
much
better.
Ooh.
The
costume
is
a
bit
much.
But
the
confidence...
I
can
feel
the
Hey,
do
you
want
to
have
a
Honor?
Patriotism?
God
bless
Amer...

What?
You
could
at
least
furnish
My
dagger,
something.

At
last.
A
little
common
sense.

And
I
thought
you
liked
tricks.
Well,
what
then?
Your
lovely
mortal
is
who
will
see
you
coming
I
won't
be
the
one
I'm
not
hungry.
-

Good.
Let's
go.
You're...
I'm
Loki,
That
was
for
New
York.
I
like
her.
SIF:
It
is
my
sworn
duty
to
notify
him
You
called
me
here
What
is
it?
Treason,
my
lord.
Whose?
Mine.
TYR:
My
king!
The
mortal
has
been
taken.
ODIN:
Stop
Thor.
By
any
means
necessary.
There
they
are!
Take
them.
On
my
command.
I'll
hold
them
off.
Thank
you.
Betray
him,
and
I'll
kill
you.

It's
good
to
see
you,
too,
Sif.
Assuming
you
can
get
Loki's
help
what
good
would
it
do?
We'd
all
be
dead
the
minute
we
That,
my
friend,
is
why
we
I
will
give
you
as
Thank
you,
my
friend.
If
you
even
think
You'll
kill
me?
Evidently,
there
will
be
a
line.


I
thought
you
said
you
knew
I
said,
"How
hard
could
it
be?"

They're
on
the
ship!
Get
to
the
ship!


Well,
whatever
you're
doing,
brother,
-
Shut
up,
Loki.
You
must
have
missed
something.
No,
I
didn't.
I'm
pressing
No,
don't
hit
it.
I'm
pressing
it
gently,

Ha,
ha!
GUARDS:
Get
him!
Get
him!
-






-

I
think
you
missed
a
column.
LOKI:
Look,
why
don't
I'm
clearly
the
better
pilot.
Is
that
right?
which
one
can
actually
fly?



Oh,
dear.
Is
she
dead?
Jane.
I'm
okay.
Ah!
Not
a
word.
Now
they're
following
us.
Now
they're
firing
at
us.
Yeah,
thank
you
it's
not
at
all
distracting!
Well
done.
You
just

You
know,
this
is
wonderful.
This
is
a
tremendous
idea.
Let's
steal
the
biggest,
and
escape
in
that.
Flying
around
the
city,
smashing
into
everything
in
It's
brilliant,
Thor!


I
see
your
time
in
the
dungeons
has
made
you
no
less
graceful,
Loki.
LOKI:
You
lied
to
me.
I'm
impressed.
I'm
glad
you're
pleased.
Now,
do
as
you
promised.
And
take
us
to
your
secret
pathway.
-
Fandral.
For
Asgard.
Nothing
personal,
boys.


Loki...
if
it
were
easy,
-
Are
you
mad?
LOKI:
Ta-da!

We
must
strike
now.
No.
Asgard
is
meaningless.
The
Aether
has
found
its
way
home.

What
I
could
do
with
the
power
It
would
consume
you.
LOKI:
For
now.
She's
strong
in
ways
Say
goodbye.
Not
this
day.
LOKI:
This
day,
the
next,
It's
a
heartbeat.
You'll
never
be
ready.
The
only
woman
will
be
snatched
from
you.
And
will
that
satisfy
you?
Satisfaction
is
not
Surrender
is
not
in
mine.
-
The
son
of
Odin...
Not
just
of
Odin.
You
think
you
alone
You
had
her
tricks,
Trust?
Was
that
her
last
expression?
Trust?
-
What
help
were
you
in
your
cell?
Who
put
me
there?
You
know
damn
well!
-
You
know
damn
well
who!

She
wouldn't
want
us
to
fight.
Well,
she
wouldn't

I
wish
I
could
trust
you.
Trust
my
rage.
You'll
have
to
sign
for
your

What?
Oh,
yeah.
My
father,
Dr.
Erik
Selvig.
One
man's
leather
wallet,
brown.
One
key
ring,
three
keys.
Prescription
medicine...
Various.
-
And...

-
These.
Those.
Thank
goodness.
Erik.
Yes?
It's,
uh,
Darcy.
Darcy.
So
good
to
see
you.
Oh,
I
missed
you,
too.
How
did
you
find
me?
You
were
naked
on
TV.
Okay,
time
to
go,
lots
to
do.
Getting
weird
now.
I
should
not
be
left
in
I
don't
get
paid
enough.
I'm
Ian
by
the
way,
Yeah,
I
don't
get
paid
either.
Are
you
all
right?
I've
had
a
God
in
my
brain.
-
I
don't
recommend
it.
Dr.
Selvig,
sir,
It's
happening.
Wait.
What's
happening?
Birds?
Birds
are
happening?
They're
starlings.
My
dad,
he
used
to
take
me
-
Nerd.
Where
did
they
go?


What
the
hell
was
that?
Why
are
you
smiling?
There's
nothing
more
reassuring
than
realizing
that
the
world
Take
me
to
Jane's
lab.
THOR:
Jane.
Malekith.
All
right.
Are
you
ready?
I
am.
You
know,
this
plan
of
yours
Yes,
possibly.
You
still
don't
trust
me,
brother?
Would
you?
No,
I
wouldn't.

JANE:
Thor!
No!
You
really
think
I
About
any
of
you?
All
I
ever
wanted
was
you
and
Odin
dead
at
my
feet!



Malekith!
I
am
Loki
of
Jotunheim,
-
and
I
bring
you
a
gift.
LOKI:
A
good
seat
from
which
-
to
watch
Asgard
burn.
He
is
an
enemy
of
Asgard.
He
was
a
prisoner
in
their
dungeons.


Look
at
me.

Loki!
Now!




Ah!





Ah!


-

-
Ah!



See
you
in
hell,
monster.

No.
No,
no,
no.
Oh,
you
fool,
you
didn't
listen.
I
know...
I'm
a
fool,
I'm
a
fool.
Stay
with
me,
okay?
I'm
sorry.
-
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
It's
okay.
It's
all
right.
I'll
tell
Father
what
I
didn't
do
it
for
him.
No!
He's
going
to
unleash
it.
Not
just
on
Asgard,
or
on
a
star.
How?
Jane,
how?
I
saw
him
on
Earth.
The
Convergence.
Oh,
God.
None
of
this
would
have
happened
Then
Malekith
would've
that
much
sooner.
I
only
found
it
because
Jane...
Now
we're
trapped
here.

It's
not
me.
Hello?
Hi,
Jane,
it's
Richard.
Richard?
Where
are
you?
I'm
still
at
the
office.
It's
been
a
crazy
day
here
today.
-
Oh,
my
God,
this
is
amazing.
I
quite
enjoyed
our
lunch
despite
never
actually
How
am
I
getting
service
here?
Is
this
a
bad
time?
JANE:
No,
no,
no.
Please,
whatever
Okay,
then.
I
was
just
wondering
Uh,
maybe
dinner
next
time.
JANE:
Uh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
-
Just
stay
on
the
phone,
okay?
Oh,
my
God.
Am
I
interrupting
something?
No,
no,
no.
Nothing
at
all.
Come
on.
I'm
losing
you
there.
Where
are
we
going?
RICHARD:
Hello?
Why
are
there
so
I'll
just
text
her.


-

So,
who's
Richard?
Really?


-
Jane!
You
can't
just
leave
like
that.
The
whole
world
is
going
crazy.
All
the
stuff
we
saw
is
spreading.
-
Did
you
go
to
a
party?
Jane!
How
wonderful.
Oh!
-
You've
been
to
Asgard.
Oh,
he,
uh...
Okay,
well,
I'm
going
to
need
All
the
work
you've
been
doing
on
Okay.
-
Are
you
well,
Erik?
Your
brother's
not
coming,
is
he?
Loki
is
dead.
Oh,
thank
God!
I...
I
meant,
I'm
so
sorry.
Thank
you.
Forgive
me,
my
liege.
I've
returned
from
Thor?
There
was
no
sign
of
Thor,
What?
We
found
a
body.
Loki.
JANE:
Malekith
is
going
to
where
all
the
nine
worlds
Amplifying
the
weapon's
impact.
For
each
additional
world,
the
power
will
increase
The
effect
would
be
universal.
But
the
Alignment
is
only
temporary.
He
must
be
in
exactly
the
right
Well,
how
do
we
know
where
that
is?
We
follow
the
directions.
This
has
happened
before
thousands
of
years
ago,
and
the
All
the
great
constructions,
the
Mayans,
the
Chinese,
They
made
use
of
the
gravitational
And
they
left
us
a
map.
Stonehenge,
Snowdon,
the
Great
Orme.
These
are
all
coordinates
Here.
Greenwich?
The
walls
between
worlds
Physics
is
going
to
go
ballistic.
Increases
and
decreases
in
gravity,
spatial
extrusions.
The
very
fabric
of
reality
I
better
get
my
pants.
DARCY:
Focus!
We
have
to
hammer
them
in
and
then
Jane
and
Erik
will
-

Do
you
even
know
Uh...
No.
Neither
do
I.

Shh!

-
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on!

Holy...
IAN:
Shit.
Ah!



You
needn't
have
come
Death
would've
come
to
you
Not
by
your
hand.
Your
universe
was
never
meant
to
be.
Your
world
and
your
family
will
be
extinguished!

ERIK:
We're
running
out
of
time.
-
Almost
there.
These
devices
were
made
to
detect
Oh,
come
on.
Come
on,
Darcy.
You
know,
with
all
that
power,
I
thought
you'd
hit
harder.



Done.
The
Convergence
will
be
in
That
just
means
we
have
to

Okay,
you
might
want
to
That
is
awesome!
How
did
you
do
that?
Well,
the
gravitational
fields
interact
with
the
weak
spots
Ooh,
get
the
guy
with
the
sword!
-
Oops.
DARCY:
Um...
-
What
the
hell
just
happened?
-



What
are
you
all
doing?
You
need
to
get
out
of
here,
now!
MAN:
That's
Thor
out
there.
He's
waving
his
hammer



BOTH:
Ah!
PILOT:

MAN:
Confirmed,
ship
is
hostile.
You
have
permission
to
engage.
PILOT:
Roger.
Missiles
locked.
Missiles
away.
Missiles
off
target.
I
repeat,
target
missed.
Mayday!
Mayday!
What
are
you
doing?
My
signal's
not
connecting.
Jane!
Come
on.






-







Are
you
all
right?
You
saved
my
life.

Yeah.
I
guess
I
did.


IAN:
Mmm.
Darcy?
-
Jane!
-
Ian!
Mew
mew!


MAN:


How
do
I
get
to
Greenwich?
Take
this
train.
Mind
the
gap.
Sorry.
Sorry.
-
We're
out
of
time.
Jane!

JANE:
Thor!
We're
too
late.

The
Convergence
is
at
its
peak.
Can
those
things
stop
him?
Not
from
here.
We
can't
get
close
enough.
Loan.


Malekith!
Darkness
returns,
Asgardian.
Have
you
come
to
witness
I've
come
to
accept
your
surrender.




You
think
you
can
stop
this?
The
Aether
cannot
be
destroyed.
But
you
can.





Thor!
No.
Jane!
Ah!

Everybody
okay?

DARCY:
He's
gonna
come
back.
Except,
you
know,
last
time
he
was
gone
for,
Well,
it's
only
been
two
days,
so...
Did
he
say
anything
before
he
left?
Yeah,
he
had
to
figure
some
He
kinda
committed
treason...
Oh.
ODIN:
You
once
said
there
would
You
were
wrong.
The
Alignment
has
brought
Every
one
of
them
saw
you
What
can
Asgard
offer
My
life.
Father,
I
cannot
be
king
of
Asgard.
I
will
protect
Asgard
and
all
the
but
I
cannot
do
so
from
that
chair.
Loki,
for
all
his
grave
imbalance,
The
brutality,
the
sacrifice...
it
changes
you.
I'd
rather
be
a
good
man
Is
this
my
son
I
hear,
When
you
speak,
This
is
not
for
Jane,
Father.
She
does
not
know
Now,
forbid
me
to
see
her,
It
changes
nothing.
One
son
who
wanted
another
who
will
not
take
it.
Is
this
my
legacy?
Loki
died
with
honor.
I
shall
try
to
live
the
same.
Is
that
not
legacy
enough?
It
belongs
to
you.
If
you
are
worthy
of
it.
I
shall
try
to
be.
I
cannot
give
you
my
blessing,
I
know.
If
I
were
proud
of
the
man
even
that,
I
could
not
say.
It
would
speak
only
from
my
heart.
Go.
My
son.
Thank
you,
Father.
No.
Thank
you.

I
present
to
you,
Taneleer
Tivan,
the
Collector.
Whoa...
Asgardians,
it's
an
honor.
You
know
why
we're
here.
Of
course.
But,
if
I
may
ask,
why
not
keep
it
secure
The
Tesseract
is
It
is
not
wise
to
keep
two
That's
very
wise.
I
can
assure
you,
it
will
be
absolutely
safe
here,
in
my
collection.
See
that
it
is.
One
down.
Five
to
go.
