My

Good.
Twice

double

Get–


I

fear

you,

You

hate.
You
have
anger.

don’t

Good,
Anakin.
Good.
Kill
him.
Kill
him
now.
I
shouldn’t.
Do
it.
You
did
well,
Anakin.
He
was
too
dangerous
to
be
kept
alive.
Yes,
but
he
was
an
unarmed
prisoner.
I
shouldn’t
have
done
that.
It
is
only
natural.
It
wasn’t
the
first
time,
Anakin.
Remember
what
you
told
me

Now
we
must
leave
Anakin,
there’s
no
time.
We
must
get
off
this
ship
before
it’s
too
late.

He
seems
to
be
all
right.
His
fate
will
be

Hold

Let
us
not

Anakin,
And
you
killed
Count
Dooku,
carrying
me
unconscious
on
your
back.
All
because
of
your
training.
Anakin,
let’s
be
fair.
Today
you
were
the
hero,
and
you
deserve
your
glorious
day
All

you

That

I’ll
see

Chancellor
Palpatine,
are

all

Yes.
Thanks

your

They

Dooku,
General

myself.
But
the

ORGANA:

Excuse
me.


Oh,
Anakin.

There
were
whispers
that
you’d
been
killed.
I’m

It

like
we’ve
been
apart
for

don’t

I’m–
I’m
tired

this

Anakin,
don’t

Are

You’re

What’s
going

ANAKIN:
Put
me
on

It’s
never
been

Oh,
calm
down,
Anakin.
To
be
on
the
council
at
your
age–
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
The
council
doesn’t
like
it
-
I
swear
to
you,
I
didn’t
ask
Your
friendship
with
Chancellor
Palpatine
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
The
only
reason
the
council
is
because
the
chancellor
trusts
you.
-
And?
-
I
didn’t
want
to
put
you
The
council
wants
you
to
report
They
want
to
know
what
he’s
up
to.
They
want
me
to
spy
on
the
chancellor?
-
But
that’s
treason.
Why
didn’t
the
council
give
me
this
assignment
This
assignment
is
not
to
be
on
record.
The
chancellor
is
not
a
bad
man,
Obi-Wan.
He
befriended
me.
He’s
watched
out
for
me
That
is
why
you
must
help
us.
Anakin,
our
allegiance
is
to
the
senate,
who
has
managed
to
stay
in
office
The
senate
demanded
that
he
stay
longer.
Yes,
but
use
your
feelings,
Anakin.

You’re
asking
me
against
the
Republic,
That’s
what’s
out
of
place
here.
The
council
is
asking
you.
Anakin
did
not
take

his
new
assignment
WINDU:
I
don’t

can
handle
it.

all
due

the
prophecy

He
will
not
let
me
down.
He
never
has.
I
hope
right
you
are.

I
wonder

failure
to
listen.

you’re
closer
Please,
ask
him
to
stop

Don’t
ask
me
to
do
that.
Make
a
motion

Don’t
do
this.
Hold

If

what
I
have
come
to
suspect.
The
Jedi
Council
want
control
ofthe

They’re
planning
to
betray

I

Search

don’t

-
I
know
they
don’t
trust
you.
Or
the
Republic,
or
democracy,
for
that
matter.
I
have
to
admit,
Why?
They
asked
you
to
do
something...
that
made
you
feel
dishonest,
didn’t
they?
They
asked
you
to
spy
on
me,
didn’t
they?
I
don’t,
uh–
I
don’t
know
what
to
say.
Remember
back
to
your
early
teachings.
All
who
gain
power
are
afraid
to
lose
it.
-
Even
the
Jedi.
Good
is
a
point
of
view,
Anakin.
The
Sith
and
the
Jedi
including
their
quest
for
greater
power.
The
Sith
rely
on
their
passion
They
think
inwards–
only
about
themselves.
And
the
Jedi
don’t?
The
Jedi
are
selfless.

Did
you
ever
hear
the
tragedy
-
No.
It’s
not
a
story
the
Jedi
would
tell
you.
It’s
a
Sith
legend.
Darth
Plagueis...
was
a
dark
lord
of
the
Sith
he
could
use
the
Force
to
create...
life.
He
had
such
a
knowledge
of
the
dark
side,
he
could
even
keep
the
ones
he
cared
about...
from
dying.
He
could
actually...
save
people
from
death?
The
dark
side
of
the
Force
some
consider
to
be
unnatural.
Wh–
What
happened
to
him?
He
became
so
powerful,
the
only
thing
he
was
afraid
of
was...
losing
his
power.
Which
eventually,
of
course,
he
did.
Unfortunately,
he
taught
his
apprentice
Then
his
apprentice
killed
him
in
his
sleep.
It’s
ironic.
He
could
save
others
from
death,
but
not
himself.
Is
it
possible
to
learn
this
power?
Not
from
a
Jedi.

small
boy.

trust

with
their
lives.
Something’s
happening.
I’m
not
the
Jedi
I
should
be.
I
want
more.
And
I
know
I
shouldn’t.
You
expect
too
much
of
yourself.
-
I
found
a
way
to
save
you.
From
my
nightmares.
Is
that
what’s
bothering
you?
I
won’t
lose
you,
Padmé.
I’m
not
gonna
die
in
childbirth,
Ani.
-
I
promise
you.


Greetings,
young
Jedi.
What
brings
you
to
our
remote
sanctuary?
Unfortunately,
the
war.
There’s
no
war
here–
With
your
kind
permission,
and

use
your
city

a
base

He

hostage.

They
are
watching
us.
Tenth

thousands

droids.
Tell
your
people
to
take
shelter.
If
you
have
warriors,
now
is
the

Take
the

back

Is
he
bringing
additional
warriors?








It
won’t

I
will

Jedi
slime

Master

may
I
interrupt?
General
Kenobi
has
made
contact
and
we
have
begun
our
attack.
WINDU:
Anakin,
deliver
this
report
to
the
chancellor.
His
reaction
will
give
us
Yes,
Master.
I
sense
a
plot
to
destroy
the
Jedi.
The
dark
side
of
the
Force
If
he
does
not
give
up
his
emergency
pwers
then
he
should
be
removed
from
office.
The
Jedi
Council
in
order
to
secure
a
peaceful
transition.
To
a
dark
place
Hmm.
Great
care
we
must
take.
Chancellor
We’ve
just
received
He
has
engaged
General
Grievous.
We
can
only
hope
that
Master
Kenobi
I
should
be
there
with
him.
It’s
upsetting
to
me
to
see
that
the
council...
doesn’t
seem
to
fully
appreciate
your
talents.
Don’t
you
wonder
I
wish
I
knew.
More
and
more
I
get
the
feeling
that...
I’m
being
excluded
from
the
council.
I
know
there
are
things
about
the
Force
They
don’t
trust
you,
Anakin.
They
see
your
future.
They
know
your
power
You
must
break
through
the
fog
of
lies
Let
me
help
you
to
know
How
do
you
know
My
mentor
taught
me
everything
about
the
Force.
Even
the
nature
of
the
dark
side.
You
know
the
dark
side?
Anakin,
if
one
is
to
understand
the
great
mystery,
one
must
study
all
its
aspects,
not
just
the
dogmatic
narrow
view
ofthe
Jedi.
If
you
wish
to
become
you
must
embrace
Be
careful
of
the
Jedi,
Anakin.
Only
through
me...
can
you
achieve
a
power
greater
than
any
Jedii.
Learn
to
know
the
dark
side
of
the
Force,
and
you
will
be
able
to
save
your
wife...
from
certain
death.
What
did
you
say?
Use
my
knowledge.
I
beg
you.
You’re
the
Sith
lord.
I
know
what’s
been
troubling
you.
Don’t
continue
to
be
a
pawn
of
the
Jedi
Council.
Ever
since
I’ve
known
you,
greater
than
that
of
an
ordinary
Jedi.
A
life
of
significance,
of
conscience.
-
Are
you
going
to
kill
me?
I
know
you
would.
I
can
feel
your
anger.
It
gives
you
focus,
makes
you
stronger.
-
I’m
going
to
turn
you
over
But
you’re
not
sure
I
will
quickly
discover
the
truth
of
all
this.
You
have
great
wisdom,
Anakin.
Know
the
power
of
the
dark
side.
Power
to
save
Padmé.

Aaah!



So
uncivilized.

ANAKIN:
Skywalker,
we
just
received
word
We’re
on
our
way
to
make
sure
the
chancellor
He
won’t
give
up
his
power.
I
think
Chancellor
Palpatine
is
a
Sith
lord.
A
Sith
lord?
Yes.
The
one
we’ve
been
looking
for.
-
How
do
you
know
this?
He’s
been
trained
to
use
the
dark
side.
-
Are
you
sure?
Then
our
worst
fears
have
been
realized.
We
must
move
quickly
Master,
the
chancellor
is
very
powerful.
You’ll
need
my
help
For
you
own
good,
stay
out
of
this
affair.
I
sense
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
you,
There
is
much
fear
that
clouds
your
judgment.
-
I
must
go,
Master.
If
what
you’ve
told
me
is
true,
you
will
have
gained
my
trust.
But
for
now,
remain
here.
Wait
in
the
council
chambers
until
we
return.

Obi-Wan

I

Obi-Wan.
The
Jedi
turned
against

I
don’t

you
anymore.
Anakin,
you’re
breaking
my
heart.
You’re
going
down
a
path
I
can’t
follow.
Because
of
Obi-Wan?
Because
of
what
you’ve
done.
What
you
plan
to
do.
Stop.
Stop
now.
Come
back.

I
love
you.

No.
You’re

him!
-
No.
Anakin.
Let
her
go.

You
turned
her
against
me!
You
have
done
that
yourself.
You
will
not
take
her
from
me!
Your
anger
and
your
lust
for
power
You
have
allowed

lord

Don’t

as
you
do.
I

peace,

Your
new
empire?

you.
Anakin,
my
allegiance
if
you’re
not
with
me,
then
you’re
my
enemy.

a
Sith
deals
in
absolutes.
I
will
do
what
I
must.
You
will
try.



I
hear
a
new
apprentice
you
have,
Emperor.
Or
should
I
call
you
Darth
Sidious?
Master
Yoda.
You
survived.
Surprised?
Your
arrogance
blinds
you,
Master
Yoda.
Now
you
will
experience...
the
full
power
of
the
dark
side.

I
have
waited
a
long
time...
for
this
moment,
my
little

friend.
