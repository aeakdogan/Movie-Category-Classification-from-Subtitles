DILIOS:
...
like
all
Spartans,
he
was
inspected.
If
he'd
been
small
or
puny
...
he
would
have
been
discarded.
From
the
time
he
could
stand,

Taught
never
to
retreat,
Taught
that
death
on
the
battlefield
...
was
the
greatest
glory
At
age
7,
as
is
customary
in
Sparta...
...
the
boy
was
taken
from
his
mother

Manufactured
by
300
years
...
to
create
the
finest
soldiers
The
agoge,
as
it's
called,
Starves
them,
forces
them
to
steal...
...
and
if
necessary,
to
kill.
By
rod
and
lash
the
boy
was
punished...
...
taught
to
show
no
pain,
no
mercy.
Constantly
tested,
tossed
into
the
wild.
Left
to
pit
his
wits
and
will
It
was
his
initiation...
...
his
time
in
the
wild...
...
for
he
would
return
to
his
people
...
or
not
at
all.

The
wolf
begins
to
circle
the
boy.
Claws
of
black
steel...
...
fur
as
dark
night.
Eyes
glowing
red...
...
jewels
from
the
pit
of
hell
itself.
The
giant
wolf
sniffing...
...
savoring
the
scent
of
the
meal
to
come.



It's
not
fear
that
grips
him...
...
only
a
heightened
sense
of
things.
The
cold
air
in
his
lungs.
Windswept
pines

His
hands
are
steady.
His
form...
...
perfect.
And
so
the
boy,
given
up
for
dead...
...
returns
to
his
people,
Our
king,
Leonidas!

It's
been
more
than
30
years
And
now,
as
then,
a
beast
approaches.
Patient
and
confident,
But
this
beast
...
swords
and
spears.
An
army
of
slaves,
vast
beyond
imagining,
Ready
to
snuff
out
the
world's
A
beast
approaches...
...
and
it
was
King
Leonidas
himself

LEONIDAS:

LEONIDAS:
Now,
the
more
you
sweat
My
father
taught
me...
...
that
fear
is
always
a
constant.
But
accepting
it...
...
makes
you
stronger.
My
queen.
A
Persian
emissary
awaits
Leonidas.
In
the
end...
...
a
Spartan's
true
strength
So
give
respect
and
honor
to
him,
First...
-
...
you
fight
with
your
head.
What
is
it?
A
Persian
messenger
awaits
you.
Do
not
forget
today's
lesson.
-
Respect
and
honor.
Councilman
Theron.
My
king
and
queen,
I"m
sure.
Before
you
speak,
Persian...
...
know
that
in
Sparta
everyone,
...
is
held
accountable
Now,
what
message
do
you
bring?
Earth
and
water.
You
rode
all
the
way
from
Persia
Do
not
be
coy
or
stupid,
Persian.
What
makes
this
woman
Because
only
Spartan
women
Let
us
walk
to
cool
our
tongues.
If
you
value
your
lives
...
listen
carefully,
Leonidas.
Xerxes
conquers
and
controls
He
leads
an
army
so
massive,
So
vast,
it
drinks
the
rivers
dry.
All
the
God-King
Xerxes
requires
is
this:
A
simple
offering
of
earth
and
water...
...
a
token
of
Sparta's
submission
Submission.
Now,
that's
a
bit
of
a
problem.
See,
rumor
has
it...
...
the
Athenians
And
if
those
philosophers
and
boy-lovers
-
We
must
be
diplomatic.
...
have
their
reputation
to
consider.
Choose
your
next
words
carefully,
They
may
be
your
last
as
king.
LEONIDAS:
Madman.
You"re
a
madman.
Earth
and
water.
You'll
find
plenty
of
both
down
there.
No
man,
Persian
or
Greek,
You
bring
the
crowns
and
heads
You
insult
my
queen.
You
threaten
my
people
Oh,
I've
chosen
my
words
carefully,
Perhaps
you
should
have
done
the
same.
This
is
blasphemy.
This
is
madness!
Madness?
This
is
Sparta!




EPHOR
1:
We
have
been
expecting
you.
DILIOS:
Inbred
swine.
More
creature
than
man.
Creatures
whom
even
Leonidas
For
no
Spartan
king
has
gone
to
war
LEONIDAS:
The
Persians
claim
I
hope,
for
our
sake,
they
exaggerate.
But
there's
no
question,
we
face
Before
your
plan
is
heard...
...
what
do
you
offer?
We
will
use
our
superior
fighting
skills...
...
and
the
terrain
of
Greece
herself
We
will
march
north
to
the
coast,
It
is
August,
Leonidas.
EPHOR
2:
Sparta
wages
no
war
Sparta
will
burn!
Her
men
will
die
at
arms...
...
and
her
women
and
children
Now,
we
will
block
...
by
rebuilding
the
great
Phocian
Wall.
And
from
there,
we
will
funnel
them
into
Now,
in
that
narrow
corridor,
And
wave
after
wave
of
Persian
attack...
...
will
smash
against
Spartan
shields.
Xerxes'
losses
will
be
so
great,
...
he
will
have
no
choice
We
must
consult
the
oracle.
Trust
the
gods,
Leonidas.
I'd
prefer
you
trusted
your
reason.
Your
blasphemies...
...
have
cost
us
quite
enough
already.
Don't
compound
them.
We
will
consult
the
oracle.
DILIOS:
Worthless
remnants
of
a
time
Remnants
of
a
senseless
tradition.
Tradition
even
Leonidas
cannot
defy...
...
for
he
must
respect
That
is
the
law.
And
no
Spartan,
subject
or
citizen,
...
slave
or
king,
is
above
the
law.
The
ephors
choose
only
...
to
live
among
them
as
oracles.
Their
beauty
is
their
curse...
...
for
the
old
wretches
...
and
souls
as
black
as
hell.
[ORACLE
WHISPERING
EPHOR:
...
Sparta
will
fall.
All
Greece
will
fall.
Trust
not
in
men...
...
honor
the
gods.
Honor
the
Carneia."
DILIOS:
Pompous,
inbred
swine.
Worthless,
diseased,
rotten...
...
corrupt.
THERON:
Truly,
you"re
...
O
wise
and
holy
men.
Yes.
And
when
Sparta
burns,
Fresh
oracles
shall
be
delivered
to
you...
...
daily...
...
from
every
corner
of
the
empire.

GORGO:
Your
lips
can
finish
Or
has
the
oracle
robbed
you
It
would
take
more
than
the
words
...
to
rob
me
of
my
desire
for
you.
Then
why
so
distant?
Because
it
seems...
...
though
a
slave
and
captive
...
the
oracle's
words
So
that
is
why
my
king
loses
sleep
There's
only
one
woman's
words
that
Those
are
mine.

Then
what
must
a
king
do
...
when
the
very
laws
he
is
sworn
It
is
not
a
question
...
nor
a
husband,
nor
a
king.
Instead
ask
yourself,
my
dearest
love...
...
what
should
a
free
man
do?
-
Is
this
all
of
them?
All
with
born
sons
to
carry
on
their
name.
We
are
with
you,
sire.
For
Sparta.
For
freedom.
To
the
death.
LEONIDAS:
He
is
too
young
I
have
others
to
replace
him.
No
younger
than
we
were
the
first
time
You
are
a
good
friend...
...
but
a
better
captain,
there
is
none.
COUNCILMAN:
My
good
king,
the
oracle
has
spoken.
The
ephors
have
spoken.
It
is
the
law,
my
lord.
-
The
Spartan
army
must
not
go
to
war.
I've
issued
no
such
orders.
I"m
here
just
taking
a
stroll,
These
300
men
Our
army
will
stay
in
Sparta.
Where
will
you
go?
I
hadn't
really
thought
about
it...
...
but
now
that
you
ask...
...
I
suppose
I'll
head
north.
The
Hot
Gates?
CAPTAIN:
Move
out!
What
shall
we
do?
What
can
we
do?
What
can
you
do?
Sparta
will
need
sons.
Spartan!
Yes,
milady?
Come
back
with
your
shield...
...
or
on
it.
Yes,
milady.
DILIOS:
He
doesn't
say
it.
There's
no
room
for
softness...
...
not
in
Sparta.
No
place
for
weakness.
Only
the
hard
and
strong
Only
the
hard.
Only
the
strong.
We
march...
...
for
our
lands,
for
our
families,
We
march.
LEONIDAS:
-
What
a
pleasant
surprise.
-
We've
been
tricked.
BAKER:
This
is
a
surprise.
ARCADIAN:
We
heard
Sparta
was
on
the
warpath
If
it
is
blood
you
seek,
But
you
bring
only
this
handful
I
see
I
was
wrong
to
expect
Sparta's
Doesn't
it?
You,
there.
What
is
your
profession?
I"m
a
potter,
sir.
And
you,
Arcadian.
-
Sculptor,
sir.
-
And
you?
Spartans!
What
is
your
profession?

You
see,
old
friend?
I
brought
more
soldiers
than
you
did.
DILIOS:
...
not
for
the
king.
All
his
40
years
...
to
this
one
gleaming
moment
...
this
one
radiant
clash
...
sword
and
bone,
and
flesh
and
blood.
His
only
regret...
...
is
that
he
has
so
few
to
sacrifice.
We"re
being
followed.
It
has
followed
us
since
Sparta.
STELIOS:
STELIOS:
Where
are
all
the
people?
Persians.
I
put
their
number
at
around
20.
A
scouting
party.
But
these
footprints...
.

STELIOS:
Child!
CHILD
:
They...
.
They
came
with
beasts
With
their
claws
and
fangs...
...
they
grabbed
them.
Everyone...
...
but
me.
DILIOS:
I
found
them.
Have
the
gods
no
mercy?
We
are
doomed.
Quiet
yourself.
The
child
speaks
of
the
Persian
ghosts,
They
are
the
hunters
of
men's
souls.
They
cannot
be
killed
or
defeated.
Not
this
darkness.
Not
these
Immortals.
Immortals?
We'll
put
their
name
to
the
test.
DILIOS:
Into
that
narrow
corridor
we
march...
...
where
Xerxes'
numbers
Spartans,
citizen-soldiers,
freed
slaves.
Brave
Greeks,
all.
Brothers,
fathers,
sons...
...
we
march.
For
honors
sake,
for
duty's
sake,
Look!
Persians.
DILIOS:

Let's
watch
these
motherless
dogs...
...
as
they"re
embraced
by
the
loving
arms
True.
It
does
look
like
rain.
DILIOS:
...
and
batters
the
Persian
ships
Glorious.

DILIOS:
Only
one
among
us
Only
he.
Only
our
king.
My
queen?
My
queen...
...
the
courtyard
is
a
more
fitting
place
I"m
afraid
gossip
and
protocol...
...
are
the
least
of
my
worries
now,
Is
such
secrecy
needed?
How
am
I
to
trust
beyond
the
walls
Even
here,
Theron
has
eyes
and
ears
You
speak
as
if
all
Sparta
I
wish
it
were
only
against
me.
LOYALIST:
Many
on
our
council
...
and
follow
Leonidas...
...
but
you
must
show
them
favor.
And
you
can
arrange
for
me
If
it
is
reason
they
want,
LOYALIST:
Freedom
isn't
free
at
all.
That
it
comes
with
the
highest
of
costs,
I
will
do
my
best
to
gather
our
council.
And
its
chamber
GORGO:
I"m
in
your
debt.
Leonidas
is
my
king
as
well
as
yours.
I
saw
those
ships
smash
on
the
rocks.
How
can
this
be?
We
saw
but
a
fraction
of
the
monster
DAXOS:
Why
do
you
smile?
Arcadian...
...
I
have
fought
countless
times...
...
yet
I've
never
met
an
adversary
...
what
we
Spartans
I
can
only
hope...
...
with
all
the
world's
warriors
...
there
might
be
one
down
there

PERSIAN
EMISSARY:

Keep
going,
you
dogs!
Move!
Forward,
I
say!
Stop
here!
Who
commands
here?
I
am
the
emissary...
...
to
the
ruler
of
all
the
world...
...
the
god
of
gods,
king
of
kings...
...
and
by
that
authority...
...
I
demand
that
someone
Listen.
Do
you
think
the
paltry
dozen
These
hills
swarm
with
our
scouts.
And
do
you
think
your
pathetic
wall
...
except
fall
like
a
heap
of
dry
leaves
STELIOS:
...
using
ancient
stones
And
with
a
little
Spartan
help...
...
your
Persian
scouts
supplied
the
mortar.
You
will
pay
for
your
barbarism!
My
arm!
STELIOS:
Go
now.
Run
along
and
tell
your
Xerxes
...
not
slaves.
Do
it
quickly...
...
before
we
decide
to
make
our
wall
No.
Not
slaves.

Your
women
will
be
slaves.
Your
sons,
your
daughters...
...
your
elders
will
be
slaves!
But
not
you,
no.
By
noon
this
day
you
will
be
dead
men.
A
thousand
nations
of
the
Persian
Empire
Our
arrows
will
blot
out
the
sun.
Then
we
will
fight
in
the
shade.
CAPTAIN:
It'll
do
the
job
of
funneling
the
Persians
Have
the
men
found
any
route
CAPTAIN:
There
is
such
a
route,
good
king.
Just
pass
that
western
ridge.
It's
an
old
goat
path.
The
Persians
could
use
it
to
outflank
us.
Not
one
step
closer,
monster!
Wise
king,
I
humbly
request
an
audience.
-
I'll
skewer
you
where
you
stand.
Forgive
the
captain.
He
is
a
good
soldier...
...
but
a
bit
short
on
manners.
There
is
nothing
to
forgive,
brave
king.
You
wear
the
crimson
of
a
Spartan.
I
am
Ephialtes,
born
of
Sparta.
My
mother's
love
...
lest
I
be
discarded.
Your
shield
and
armor?
My
father's,
sir.
I
beg
you,
bold
king,
...
to
redeem
my
father's
name
My
father
trained
me
to
feel
no
fear,
...
as
much
a
part
of
me
I
will
earn
my
father's
armor,
noble
king...
...
by
serving
you
in
the
battle.

A
fine
thrust.
I
will
kill
many
Persians.
Raise
your
shield.
-
Sire?

Your
father
should
have
taught
you
We
fight...
...
as
a
single,
impenetrable
unit.
That
is
the
source
of
our
strength.
Each
Spartan
protects
the
man
...
from
thigh
to
neck
with
his
shield.
A
single
weak
spot
From
thigh
to
neck,
Ephialtes.
I
am
sorry,
my
friend.
-
But
not
all
of
us
were
made
to
be
soldiers.
-
If
you
want
to
help
in
a
Spartan
victory...
...
clear
the
battlefield
of
the
dead,
...
but
as
for
the
fight
itself...
...
I
cannot
use
you.
EPHIALTES:


Mother!
Father!
You
were
wrong!
You
are
wrong!
Leonidas!
You
are
wrong!
Dispatch
the

This
is

This

This

Earn
these

Remember
this

for
it
will
be
yours
for
all

Spartans!
Lay
down
your
weapons!

Persians!
Come
and
get
them!


Hold!
Give

nothing...
...
but
take
from

everything!
Steady!

Push!
Is
that
the
best
you
can
do?
Push!
Push!

Now!
Push!
No
prisoners!
No

They
look
thirsty.
Well,
let's
give
them
something
to
drink.
To
the

Halt.
Hell
of
a
good

Tuck
tail!
Persian
cowards.

What
the
hell
are
you
laughing
at?
-
What?

LEONIDAS:
Today
no
Spartan
dies.
Easy,
son.


DILIOS:
...
what
we
were
bred
to
do...
...
what
we
were
born
to
do.
No
prisoners.
No
mercy.
A
good
start.
LOYALIST:
GORGO:
Is
doing
what
children
do
best.
Your

starts
the

next
year.
That
is
always
a
difficult
time
Yes,
it
will
be
hard.
But
also
necessary.
You
will
speak
before
the
council
My
husband
does
not
have
two
days.
Think
of
the
two
days
as
a
gift.
It's
no
secret...
...
Theron
wants
what
you
control.
It's
his
voice
you
must
silence.
Make
him
your
ally...
...
and
you
will
have
your
victory.
Thank
you.
You
are
wise
as
you
are
kind.
THERON:
You
should
keep
a
better
eye
on
him
Be
unfortunate
if
anything
Or
to
his
beautiful
mother.
PERSIAN:
Our
Greek
comrades
are
begging
Good.
I've
got
something
Tell
Daxos
that
I
want
him...
...
and
20
of
his
best
eager,
sober
King
Leonidas.
-
Stelios,
catch
your
breath,
boy.
The
Persians
are
approaching.
A
small
contingent.
LEONIDAS:
Captain,
I
leave
you
in
charge.
LEONIDAS:
If
they
assassinate
me,
Pray
they"re
that
stupid.
Pray...
...
we"re
that
lucky.
Besides...
...
there's
no
reason
we
can't
be
civil...
...
is
there?

None,
sire.
Let
me
guess.
You
must
be
Xerxes.
Come,
Leonidas.
Let
us
reason
together.
It
would
be
a
regrettable
waste...
...
it
would
be
nothing
short
of
madness

and
your
valiant
troops
to
perish...
...
all
because
of
a
simple

There's
much
our
cultures
could
share.
We've
been
sharing

culture
Yours
is
a

Even
now
you
are
defiant...
...
in
the
face
of
annihilation
It
isn't
wise
to
stand
against
me,
Imagine
what
a
horrible
fate
...
when
I
would
gladly
kill
And
I
would
die
for
any
one
of
mine.
You
Greeks
take
pride
in
your
logic.
Consider
the
beautiful
land
Picture
it
reduced
to
ash
at
my
whim.
Consider
the
fate
of
your
women.
Clearly
you
don't
know
our
women.
I
might
as
well
have
marched
them
up
here,
You
have
many
slaves,
Xerxes...
...
but
few
warriors.
It
won't
be
long
...
more
than
your
whips.
It's
not
the
lash
they
fear...
...
it
is
my
divine
power.
But
I
am
a
generous
god.
I
will
make
you
warlord
of
all
Greece.
You
will
carry
my
battle
standard
Your
Athenian
rivals...
...
will
kneel
at
your
feet...
...
if
you
will
but
kneel
at
mine.
You
are
generous...
...
as
you
are
divine...
...
O
king
of
kings.
Such
an
offer
But
the...
.
The
idea
of
kneeling,
it's...
.
You
see,
slaughtering
Well,
it's
left
a
nasty
cramp
in
my
leg...
...
so
kneeling
will
be
hard
for
me.
There
will
be
no
glory
in
your
sacrifice.
I
will
erase
even
the
memory
of
Sparta
Every
piece
of
Greek
parchment
Every
Greek
historian
and
every
scribe
...
and
their
tongues
Why,
uttering
the
very
name
of
Sparta
The
world
will
never
know
The
world
will
know
That
few
stood
against
many.
And
before
this
battle
was
over...
...
that
even
a
god-king
can
bleed.
You
fought
well
today...
...
for
a
woman.
As
did
you.
Maybe
if
I"m
injured,
STELIOS:
Perhaps
I
was
so
More
likely
offering
your
backside
Jealousy...
...
does
not
become
you,
my
friend.
Move
it,
men!
Pile
those
Persians
high.
For
unless
I
miss
my
guess...
...
we"re
in
for
one
wild
night.

DILIOS:
They
have
served
the
dark
Eyes
as
dark
as
night.
Teeth
filed
to
fangs.
Soulless.
The
personal
guard
to
King
Xerxes
himself.
The
deadliest
fighting
force
in
all
of
Asia:
The
Immortals.
The
god-king
has
betrayed
a
fatal
flaw:
Hubris.
Easy
to
taunt,
easy
to
trick.
Before
wounds
and
weariness
...
the
mad
king
Xerxes
has
taken
the
bait.
Spartans,
push!

DILIOS:
We
put
their
name
to
the
test.


STELIOS:


SPARTAN:


Arcadians,
now!
Go!
Show
the
Spartans
what
we
can
do.
Go!
[ARCADIANS
SHOUTING
DILIOS:
...
stabbing
wildly,
They
make
a
wondrous
mess
of
things.
Brave
amateurs,
they
do
their
part.
Immortals.
They
fail
our
king's
test.
And
a
man
who
fancies
himself
a
god...
...
feels
a
very
human
chill
To
our
king!
And
our
honored
dead.
Whom
will
Xerxes
dare
to
send
next?
There's
nothing
that
can
stop
us
now!
Even
the
king
allows
himself
Such
mad
hope,
but
there
it
is:
"Against
Asia's
endless
hordes,
We
can
hold
the
Hot
Gates.
We
can
win."
Dawn.
Whips
crack.
Barbarians
howl.
Those
behind
cry,
'"Forward!'"
Those
in
front
cry,
"Back!"
Our
eyes
bear
witness
...
coughed
forth
from
the
darkest
corner
When
muscle
failed...
...
they
turned
to
their
magic.
One
hundred
nations
descend
upon
us,
Funneled
into
this
narrow
corridor,
They
fall
by
the
hundreds.
We
send
the
severed
bodies
King
Xerxes
is
displeased
He
disciplines
them.
Xerxes
dispatches
his
monsters
They"re
clumsy
beasts...
...
and
the
piled
Persian
dead
are
slippery.
-
You
still
here?
Not
now,
I"m
a
little
busy.
Regroup!
Astinos!
My
son!
Astinos!
No!
Day
wears
on.
We
lose
few...
...
but
each
felled
is
a
friend,
And
upon
seeing
the
headless
body
...
the
captain
breaks
rank.
He
goes
wild,
blood-drunk.
The
captain's
cries
of
pain
...
are
more
frightening
to
the
enemy
It
takes
three
men
to
restrain
him
The
day
is
ours.
No
songs
are
sung.
Your
gods
were
cruel
to
shape
you
so,
The
Spartans,
too...
...
were
cruel
to
reject
you.
But
I
am
kind.
Everything
you
could
ever
desire...
...
every
happiness
you
can
imagine...
...
every
pleasure
your
fellow
Greeks
...
I
will
grant
you.
For
I
am
kind.
Embrace
me
as
your
king
Yes.
Lead
my
soldiers
to
the
hidden
path
...
and
your
joys
will
be
endless.
Yes!
I
want
it
all.
Wealth.
Women.
And
one
more
thing...
...
I
want
a
uniform.
Done.
You
will
find...
...
I
am
kind.
Unlike
the
cruel
Leonidas,
...
I
require
only...
...
that
you
kneel.
Beautiful
night.
Yes,
but
I
did
not
ask
you
here
You
can
be
sure
of
that.
You
never
spared
words
with
me.
Can
I
offer
you
something?
Is
it
poison?
I"m
sorry
to
disappoint
you,
I"m
told
it's
been
arranged
for
you
Yes.
I
need
your
help
in
winning
votes
Yes.
I
can
see
it,
Me,
politician.
You,
warrior.
But
why
would
I
want
to
do
that?
It
proves
you
care
for
a
king
who
right
now
True.
But
this
is
politics,
not
war.
Leonidas
is
an
idealist.
I
know
your
kind
too
well.
You
send
men
Your
husband,
our
king,
He's
broken
our
laws
-
I"m
simply
a
realist.
You"re
as
foolish
as
Leonidas
if
you
think
All
men
are
not
created
equal.
I
admire
your
passion.
But
don't
think
that
you...
...
a
woman,
even
a
queen...
...
can
walk
into
the
council
chamber
I
own
that
chamber...
...
as
if
it
were
built
with
these
hands.
I
could
crush
You
will
go
before
the
council,
Leonidas
will
receive
no
reinforcements,
...
he
will
go
to
jail
or
worse.
Do
you
love
your
Sparta?
Yes.
-
And
your
king?
Your
husband
fights
for
his
land
What
do
you
have
to
offer...
...
in
return
for
my
word
What
does
a
realist
want
with
his
queen?
I
think
you
know.
This
will
not
be
over
quickly.
You
will
not
enjoy
this.
I"m
not
your
king.
Dilios.
I
trust
that
scratch
Hardly,
my
lord.
It's
just
an
eye.
The
gods
saw
fit
to
grace
me
My
captain?
Curses
the
gods
and
mourns
alone.
Leonidas!
We
are
undone.
Daxos,
calm
yourself.
Our
hunchback
traitor
led
Xerxes'
Immortals
The
Phocians
you
posted
there
-
This
battle
is
over,
Leonidas.
By
morning,
the
Immortals
will
surround
us.
Spartans!
Prepare
for
glory!
Glory?
Have
you
gone
mad?
There
is
no
glory
to
be
had
now.
Only
retreat
or
surrender.
Or
death.
Well,
that's
an
easy
choice
Spartans
never
retreat.
Go
spread
the
word.
Let
every
Greek
assembled
Let
each
among
them
And
while
you"re
at
it,
search
your
own.
My
men
will
leave
with
me.
Godspeed,
Leonidas.
Children!
Children.
Gather
round.
No
retreat,
no
surrender.
That
is
Spartan
law.
And
by
Spartan
law,
...
and
die.
A
new
age
has
begun.
An
age
of
freedom.
And
all
will
know
that
300
Spartans...
...
gave
their
last
breath
to
defend
it.
My
friend.
I
have
lived
my
entire
life
It's
not
that
my
son
It's
just
that
I
never
told
him
That
he
stood
by
me
with
honor.
That
he
was
all
that
was
best
in
me.
My
heart
is
broken
for
your
loss.
Heart?
I
have
filled
my
heart...
...
with
hate.
Good.
Dilios...
...
let's
take
a
walk.
Yes,
my
lord.
But,
sire,
I
am
fit
and
ready
for
battle.
That
you
are,
one
of
the
finest.
But
you
have
another
talent
You
will
deliver
my
final
orders
...
with
force
and
verve.
Tell
them
our
story.
Make
every
Greek
know
You'll
have
a
grand
tale
to
tell.
A
tale
of
victory.
Victory.
Yes,
my
lord.
Sire,
any
message...
?
For
the
queen?
None
that
need
be
spoken.
Hundreds
leave.
A
handful
stay.
Only
one
looks
back.
Spartans!
Ready
your
breakfast
and
eat
hearty...
...
for
tonight
we
dine
in
hell!
May
I
give
the
floor
now...
...
to
the
wife
of
Leonidas
-
What's
this?
Councilmen...
...
I
stand
before
you
I
come
to
you
as
a
mother.
I
come
to
you
as
a
wife.
I
come
to
you
as
a
Spartan
woman.
I
come
to
you
with
great
humility.
I
am
not
here
to
represent
Leonidas.
His
actions
speak
louder
I
am
here
for
all
those
voices
Mothers,
daughters,
fathers,
sons.
Three
hundred
families
...
and
for
the
very
principles
We
are
at
war,
gentlemen.
We
must
send
the
entire
Spartan
army
...
in
the
preservation
of
not
just
ourselves,
Send
the
army
Send
it
for
justice.
Send
it
for
law
and
order.
Send
it
for
reason.
But
most
importantly,
Hope
that
a
king
and
his
men
have
not
That
their
courage
bonds
us
together.
That
we
are
made
stronger
...
and
that
your
choices
today
Three
hundred.
We
must
send
them.
Moving...
...
eloquent,
passionate.
But
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
You
are
wrong.
...
and
before
that,
The
Persians
will
not
stop...
...
until
the
only
shelter
we
will
find
This
chamber
needs
no
Then
what
is
the
lesson
Shall
I
begin
to
enumerate
all
of
them?
Honor.
Duty.
Glory.
You
speak
of
honor,
duty
and
glory?
But
what
of
adultery?
-
How
dare
you.
Watch
her
carefully.
She
is
a
trickster
in
true
form.
Do
not
play
with
the
members
Just
hours
ago,
Were
I
a
weaker
man,
-
This
is
outrage.
Did
you
not
receive
a
similar
payment,
...
in
exchange
for
her
having
an
audience
-
That
is
a
lie.
Was
he
not,
by
your
invitation,
The
very
bed
where
you
attempted
You
look
shocked.
...
while
her
husband
He
speaks
truth.
Words
escape
...
my
little
whore
queen.
What
queen-like
behavior.
Remove
her
from
this
chamber
...
with
her
inglorious
and
shabby
self.
This
will
not
be
over
quickly.
You
will
not
enjoy
this.
Traitor.
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Leonidas,
my
compliments
You
surely
have
turned
calamity
Despite
your
insufferable
arrogance...
...
the
god-king
has
come
You
will
make
a
mighty
ally.
Yield,
Leonidas.
Use
your
reason.
Think
of
your
men.
I
beg
you.
Listen
to
your
fellow
Greek.
He
can
attest
Despite
your
several
insults,
...
the
lord
of
hosts
...
and
more,
to
reward
your
service.
You
fight
for
your
lands.
Keep
them.
You
fight
for
Sparta.
She
will
be
wealthier
and
more
powerful
You
fight
for
your
kingship.
You
will
be
proclaimed
warlord
...
answerable
only
Leonidas,
your
victory
will
be
complete...
...
if
you
but
lay
down
your
arms...
...
and
kneel
to
holy
Xerxes.
It's
been
more
than
30
years
And
now,
as
then,
...
only
restlessness.
The
seaborne
breeze
coolly
kissing
Gulls
cawing...
...
complaining
even
as
they
feast
The
steady
breathing
...
ready
to
die
for
him
Every
one
of
them...
...
ready
to
die.
His
helmet
is
stifling.
His
shield
is
heavy.
Your
spear.
You
there...
...
Ephialtes.
May
you
live
forever.
Leonidas,
your
spear.
Stelios!
Slaughter
them!
His
helmet
was
stifling.
It
narrowed
his
vision,
His
shield
was
heavy.
...
and
his
target
is
far
away.
The
old
ones
say
we
Spartans
Bold
Leonidas
gives
testament
His
roar
is
long
and
loud.
My
king.
It's
an
honor
to
die
at
your
side.
It's
an
honor
to
have
lived
at
yours.
My
queen!
My
wife.
My
love.
"Remember
us."
As
simple
an
order
as
a
king
can
give.
"Remember
why
we
died."
For
he
did
not
wish
tribute
or
song...
...
nor
monuments,
His
wish
was
simple.
"Remember
us"...
...
he
said
to
me.
That
was
his
hope.
Should
any
free
soul
...
in
all
the
countless
...
may
all
our
voices...
...
whisper
to
you
Go
tell
the
Spartans,
passerby...
...
that
here,
by
Spartan
law,
we
lie.
And
so
my
king
died...
...
and
my
brothers
died...
...
barely
a
year
ago.
Long
I
pondered
my
king's
Time
has
proven
him
wise.
For
from
free
Greek
to
free
Greek...
...
the
word
was
spread
...
so
far
from
home...
...
laid
down
their
lives
...
but
for
all
Greece
Now,
here
on
this
rugged
patch
of
earth
...
Xerxes'
hordes
face
obliteration!
Just
there
the
barbarians
huddle...
...
sheer
terror
gripping
tight
their
hearts...
...
with
icy
fingers...
...
knowing
full
well
...
at
the
swords
and
spears
of
300.
Yet
they
stare
now
across
the
plain
...
commanding
30,000
free
Greeks!
The
enemy
outnumber
us
Good
odds
for
any
Greek.
This
day,
we
rescue
a
world
...
and
usher
in
a
future
Give
thanks,
men...
...
to
Leonidas
and
the
brave
300.
To
victory!
