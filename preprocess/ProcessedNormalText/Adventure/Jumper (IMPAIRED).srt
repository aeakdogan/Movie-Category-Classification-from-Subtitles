little
nap
Oh,
yeah,
and
I
got

And
then
I
jumped
back...
for
the
final
quarter
courtside,
of

And
all
that
was
before
lunch.
I
could
go

of
the

Once
I
was
a
normal
person,
-
Hey,
Millie.
You
got
a
lot
of
cities
there.
Well,
if
you're
gonna
have
a
dream,
-
Right.
See
you
later.
Hey,
Millie.
Give
me
a
sec.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this.
I
picked
it
up
at
a
I-I
thought
you'd
really
like
it.
It's
a
little
dinged

love
it.

You

Mark.
-
Christmas
come
early?
-
Mark,
give
it
back
to
her.
Look
what
David
got
Millie!
Wow,
if
you
shake
this
you
can
hear
the
Eiffel
Tower
move.
-
Hey,
who
wants
to
give
it
a
shake?
-
Stop
it.
Just
give
it
back.
Okay,
I'm
sorry.
[Students
Laughing,
Sorry,
buddy.
-
I
can't
believe
you're
such
a
jerk!
-
It
wasn't
funny.

They
thought

David,
don't
go
out
there.
David,
just
forget
about
it.
Come
on,
Rice
Bowl!
David,
come
back.
Come
on.
Stop!
It's
not
worth
it.
Come
on,
David!

-
All
good.
See?

-
David...
Get
help!

Call
911!
David!

stop,
stop,
stop!

[Men
Conversing,
Look...
No,

There's
five
of
them
back
there.
You
hear
me?
Get
me
down,
David!

You're
a
Jumper!
Don't

Move!

No!


Shit.

I
could
have
dropped
you



Hi.

don't
you
wait
upstairs?
Okay.
You
know,
it
wasn't
You
shouldn't
be
here.
So
it's
true.
You're
one
of
them.
Yes,
it's
true.
You
were
five
years
old
I
only
had
two
choices.
Kill
you,
or
leave
you.
So
you
left.
-
To
protect
you.
I
did
what
I
had
to
do.
I've
never
stopped
thinking
about
you.
So
I'm
a
Jumper.
That's
right.
What
now?
I'm
giving
you
a
head
start,
Son...
because
I
love
you.
Good
luck.

Hey.
