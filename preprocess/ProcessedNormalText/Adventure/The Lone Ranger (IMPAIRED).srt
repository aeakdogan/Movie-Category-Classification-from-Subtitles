CRIER:
Step
right
up.
Step
right
up,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
and
come
with
us
to
yesteryear.
Witness
the
Wild
West
as
it
really
was.
The
greatest
show
on
Earth.
Fun
and
educational
for
you,
young
sir.

Step
right
up
to
another
time
of
mighty
beasts
-


Kemosabe?
Who?
Me?
You
bring
horses?
I
think
you
made
a
mistake,
mister.
Mistake?

Make
trade.
Trade.


Who
did
you
think
I
was,
anyway?
Never
take
off
mask.
Why
not?
You
sure
about
this?
Mmm.
Dead
man
strike
fear
All
right.
Let's
do
this.


Easy!

Ladies
and
gentlemen,
my
colleague
and
I
I
understand
this
bank
is
insured,
so...
...nobody
move.
What's
with
the
mask?
See?
I
told
you.
I
feel
ridiculous.


I
guess
I
didn't
make
myself
clear!
This
is
a
damn
bank
robbery!

WILL:
Wait
a
minute.
You're
saying
you're
Tonto?
The
Tonto?
There
is
another?
But
the
Lone
Ranger
I
mean,
they
didn't
rob
banks.
Did
they?
Come
a
time,
kemosabe...
...when
good
man
must
wear
mask.

FOREMAN:
Run
that
next
rail!
More
rocks!
They
need

WORKER:
Rail
down!

FOREMAN:
Shake
a
leg,
chums!

My
friends
and
citizens
of
Colby,
I've
asked
you
here
today
what
I
believe
to
be
the
single
most
important
enterprise
under
God.
The
unification
of
by
iron
rail.
-
To
the
Comanche,
I
say
you
have
nothing
to
fear.
As
long
as
there
is
peace
between
us
all
land
treaties
shall
be
honoured.
But
to
the
outlaw,
make
no
mistake,
law
and
order
has
come
to
the
Wild
West.
Which
is
why
I
am
bringing
notorious
outlaw
and
Indian-killer,
Butch
Cavendish
here
The
future
is
bright,
and
it's
just
around
the
bend.


HORSEMAN:
Ride
'em
out!
Come
on!
Whoa,
girl!

Run
a
man
all
the
way
to
state
line,
put
him
on
a
train
Don't
make
no
sense.
Guess
they
run
out
of
Mr
Cole
wants
to
make
an
example.
Word
is,
Cavendish
is
Reckon
so.
They
say
Butch
Cavendish
in
the
Missouri
wars.
Swallowed
it
whole.
I
heard
it
was
the
eyes.
Man
told
me
he
ate
part
of
his
own
foot
just
to
win
a
bet.
NAVARRO:
Hell,
he
did.
MARTINI
Which
is
it,
Dan?
Don't
see
how
it
makes
a
difference.
What's
the
matter
with
him?
It's
not
Cavendish
he's
worried
about.
PREACHER:
Like
Daniel
we
shall
stare
down
the
beast.
ALL:
Amen!
PREACHER:
And
purge
of
the
poisons
of
sin
and
licentiousness.
PASSENGERS:
Hallelujah!
PREACHER:
Dear
God,
grant
us
-
Amen!
PREACHER:
Thy
equanimity
so
we
might
prove
in
our
war
against
sin.
Amen!
PASSENGERS:
Amen.
Catch.


Baby,
baby,
baby-

Care
to
pray
with
us?
We're
Presbyterian.
I'm
much
obliged,
ma'am,

RANGER:
Do
you
hear
what
I
said,
boy?
I'm
gonna
enjoy
watching
them
It's
broke,
Injun.
Can't
you
see
that?


KAI:
Very
pretty-
For
you.
Oh.
No,
I
couldn't.
For
yum
She's
right.
It
matches
your

I

Well,

um,
Looks

COLE:
Danny,
one
day
soon,
you'll
be
able
travel
all
the
way
to
San
Francisco
eating
New
York
oysters
packed
in
ice.
Then
you
can
sail
to
China.
Come
back
around
That
true,
Mama?
Well,
I'll
believe
it
when
I
see
it.
Here,
let
me
show
you.
You
see
that?
Now
you
W-
Oh,
I
expect
on
a
lawman's
salary,
We
do
just
fine.
Thank
you.
Oh,
I
mean
no
disrespect.
They
don't
make
men
In
fact,
I
envy
him.
A
fine
family.
A
son
to
carry
on
his
name.
I
just
hate
to
see
a
bird
in
a
cage.

Well...
That
is
right
about
on
time.



Shh!
Piss
break,
boss.



Grace
our
spirits
will
deliver
And
provide
a
robe
and
crown...




Afternoon,
ladies.
There's
no
need
for
violence,
my
son.
-




Fifteen
hours,
Gets
on
a
man's
nerves.
I
do
not
fear
what
comes
next.

Nothing
comes
next.
Nice
suit.

Time
has
finally
come,
Windigo.
Do
I
know
you,
Injun?
You
know
me.
You
know
me
by
the
screams
of
my
ancestors
in
the
desert
wind.
As
you
will
know
their
cries
of
joy
when
I
remove
your
evil
seed
That
won't
be
necessary.
As
District
Attorney,
I'll
see
to
it
that
this
man
is
prosecuted
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law.

What
kind
of
a
lawman
Believe
me,
where
this
train's
headed,
there's
no
place
for
men
who
do.
Oh,
yeah?
Where's
that?

The
future.
CAVENDISH:
Know
something,
Maybe
you're
right.
A
lawyer
and
a
crazy
Injun.
Bet
you
two
got
a
lot
to
talk
about.
Best
make
it
quick.





Shall
we
gather
at
the
river
...the
river

I
can't
get
it
off.

No...
Play
on,
boys.


Sing
it
to
me!
Should
be
slowing
down
by
now.
Anyway,
I'm
sure
we'll
be

Get
the
horses!
Come
on!

Jesus,
we
ought
to
go.



That's
reinforced
Bethlehem
steel.
Any
attempts
at
escape
is
futile.
That's
great!
Good
job.
And
for
coming
to
the
aid
I
can
be
sure
to
put
in


FRITZ:
Come
on,
boys!
The
rail
road
waits
for
no
man!
That's
the
end
of
the
line.
We
jump.
What
about
the
passengers?
They
jump.

There
are
children
on
board.
All
jump-

Have
you
no
decency?
Windigo
getting
away!
No,
you're
not
going
anywhere.





Going
somewhere?
-
Yes.
-
No.
No.
-
No,
we
are
not.
No.
Shut
up!
Yes.



-
Ugh.



Thank
you.

Do-si-doe.

Why
don't
you
put
that
thing
down,
and
we'll
settle
this
like
men?
Although,
I
warn
you.
I
boxed
in
law
school.

Huh?


Great
warrior.
Yeah,
that's
my
brother.

Nice
suit.
We
have
to
stop
the
train.
DAN:
No
time!
Must
to
jump!
JOHN:
I'm
not
leaving
DAN:
Then
help
me
unhook
the
cars!
Come
On!

It's
jammed!
Give
me
a
hand.
You
hold.
Whoa!
John.


What
the...






Ugh.
Hey,
hold
it
right
there.
I'm
afraid
I
have
to
take
you
in.

Do
you
hear
me?
You
speak
English,
don't
you?


Halt!
By
the
authority
granted
to
me
by
the
state
of
Texas,
I'm
hereby
arresting
you.
You
all
right
there,
little
brother?
Fine.
Just
taking
this
man
into
custody.
Uh-huh.
He
was
on
that
train
for
a
reason,
Dan.
DAN:
Probably.
What's
your
crime,
boy?
Indian.

And
a
man,
in
the
eyes
of
the
law.
Now,
throw
me
your
cuffs.
Whatever
you
say,
little
brother.
-
Dan?
John.
They
said
there
was
an
accident
and
someone
fell
off
the
train.
Actually,
it
was
me.
Dan's
fine.
Saved
the
day.
Same
as
usual.
Oh,
my
God,
your
face.
Um...
Come
here.
God,
it's
good
to
see
you.
What's
it
been,
nine
years?
Eight,
since
you
stopped
writing.
We
were
just
kids
back
then.
Well,
he
takes
good
care
of
you,
I
see.

He
spends
most
his
time
in
Indian
territory
these
days.
JOHN:
Indian
territory?
Doesn't
sound
like
Dan.
Doing
what?
Well,
whatever
it
is,
he
doesn't
talk
to
me
about
it.
So...
Have
you
got
a
place
to
stay?
L.-
No.
Not
as
yet.
Well,
you
should
stay
I
don't
know.

Oh,
God,
look
at
you.
City
boy.
Why
would
you
ever
want
It's
my
home.

Who
are
you?
Danny,
this
is
your
Uncle
John.
JOHN:
Why,
you
look
when
he
was
your
age.
They're
going
out
again.

(TONTO
SINGING
He
deserves
a
trial,
Dan.
Two
Rangers
are
dead.
JOHN:
Well,
I'm
coming
with
you.
The
law
looks
a
lot
different
Well,
it
doesn't
include
vengeance,
no
matter
where
you're
standing.
For
"Wherever

If
you're
not
up
to
that,
Mr
Reid,
I'll
find

who

Maybe
you
should
think
Comanche

restless.
They're
always
restless,
but
they
keep

their
side

and
I
keep
to

Besides,

I'm

I

I'm

Is

Matches

All
right.
Now,
I
expect
you
by
the

I

Like
old

Thank
you.
All
right,
Mr
Prosecutor.
Let's
see
how

It's
Dad's.
I
hereby
deputise
you

But
I
can't

Indians

Come
to

to
the
other

You
can't
scare
me
Since
when
did
you
start
Since
my
kid
brother
became
a
lawyer.
JOHN:
Yeah?
World
needs
lawyers
I
reckon
so.
It's
a
nice
hat,
by
the
way.
They
didn't
have
a
bigger
one?

He
missed
you.
Could
have
fooled
me.
You
smell
like
a

already.
Steadies

You
even
sleep
last
night?
You
know
me,
Johnny.
Never
been
one
JOHN:
"Red's."
Hmm.
What's
this?
Like,
dancing?

Yeah.
Dancing.

Could
go
by
the
flats.
Lose
a
day.
Maybe
a
day
and
a
half.
What
is
it?
No

NAVARRO:
What
do
you
figure,
Dan?
Figure
Collins
should
go
take
a
look.
If
he
can
stay
in
the
saddle.

John.
Come
here.
No,
I
don't
believe
in
them.
Butch
Cavendish
don't

I'll
take
my
chances.

You

Come

me
your

Dan!
No!
No,
no...

You
shouldn't
have
come
back,

No,
it's

It's
okay.
I
messed

No,

You're

Come

It's

You've
looked
better.
I
heard
them
boys
in
Tulsa
-

All
heart,
ain't
you?
A
year
you
took
from
me
You
take
something
from
me,
be
damn
sure
I'm
gonna
take
something
from
you.




CAVENDISH:

Oh,
yes!



Deal
dies
with
you,
old
friend.

WILL:
That's
not
right.
It
can't
be
right.
They're
dead?
All
dead?
Even
Dan?
Dan
very
dead.
But
he's
the
Lone
Ranger.
Would
have
been
much
easier,
I
agree.
How
did
you
get
out
of
jail,
anyway?
Hmm?
And
would
you
stop
feeding
that
bird?
It's
not
alive,
you
know.
Awaiting
spirit
to
return.
Not
same
thing.


Hmm.




Greetings,
noble
spirit
horse.

No,
no!
No,
no,
please.
Half-wit.

Wet
brain.
You
come.
Come,
come.

-great
warrior.
Spirit
horse
you
have
travelled
far.
Obviously
very
fatigued.
I
understand.
You
come.
Come,
come.

Him
strong
brother.

Want
him,
bring
him
back.



John!
Give
me
your
hand!
Rebecca.
John!










If
you
are
going
to
best
to
do
it
downwind.

Why
are
you
talking
to
that
horse?
My
grandfather
spoke
When
you
get
them
alone,
some
still
do.
But
I
cannot
decide
or
pretending
to
be
stupid.
Tricky.
Why
am
I
covered
in
dirt?
Because
I
buried
you.

Then
why
am
I
alive?
Horse
says
you
are
Spirit
Walker.
A
man
who
has
been
to
the
other
side,
and
returned.
A
man
who
cannot
be
killed
in
battle.
Horse
definitely
stupid.
Are
those
my
boots?

He
cut
out
his
heart.
What
kind
of
a
man
Not
a
man.
An
evil
spirit
born
in
the
empty
spaces
of
the
desert.
With
a
hunger
that
cannot
be
satisfied.

And
the
power
My
people
call
this
spirit
"windigo."
I
am
Tonto
of
the
Comanche,
last
of
the
windigo
hunters.
So,
what
do
you
want
with
me?
A
vision
told
me
a
great
warrior
and
Spirit
Walker
I
would
have
preferred
someone
else.
Your
brother,
perhaps.
He
would
have
been
good.
But
who
am
I
to
question
All
I
know
is
a
man
killed
my
brother,
and
I'll
see
him
hang
for
it.
Then
you
will
need
this.
A
bullet?
Mmm.
A
silver
bullet?
Silver
made
him
what
he
is.
And
so
it
will
return
him
to
the
earth.
Right.
You
know
what?
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
everything
that
you've
done
for
me.
But
I
should
get
back.
I,
too,
Good.
I
was
prisoner
on
the
train
the
way
a
coyote
stalks
buffalo.
After
hunting
26
years
I
had
my
prey
until
you
interfere.
Actually,
I
think
I
saved
your
life.
So,
we're
even.
Ow!
What
the
hell
was
that
for?
Bird
angry-
Yeah.
You
know
what?
I
can't
help
you.
Or
your
bird.
Where
do
you
go?
Into
town,
to
form
a
posse.
I
would
not
do
that,
kemosabe.
Yeah?
There
was
a
gun
Eight
men
rode
into
canyon.
I
dig
seven
graves.
Collins.
He's
known
us
since
we
were
kids.
You
find
traitor,
you
find
the
man
who
killed
your
brother.
That's
my
brother's
vest.
Eyes,
cut
by
the
bullets
that
killed
him.
From
the
great
beyond,
he
will
protect
you
and
the
ones
you
love.
You
want
me
to
wear
a
mask?
The
men
you
seek
Better
to
stay
that
way.
All
right,
but
if
we
ride
together,
it's
to
bring
these
men
to
justice
Is
that
understood?
Justice
is
what
I
seek,
kemosabe.

Step
right
up,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
into
the
Hall
of
Human
Deformities.
Fun
and
educational
for
you,
sir.

ALL:

Where
the
grapes
of
wrath
are
stored...
God
has
forsaken
all
you
sinners,
and
now
the
armies
of
hell
are
upon
us.
Heathen.
Heathen!
Heathen
in
our
midst!
Heathen!
I'm
looking
for
a
man.
I
bet.
Got
money?
Of
course.
Where
did
you
get
that?
Make
trade.
With
a
dead
man?
Hard
bargain.


So...
Are
all
these
women
professionals?
Sickness
of
greed
is
strong.
What
about
her?
Oh,
yes.
Her,
too.
So
how
do
you
know
all
this?
A
vision
said
it
would
be
so.
Hmm.
Hi,
Tonto.

Couple
of
freaks
here
to
see
you.
RED:
Mmm-hmm.
Thank
you,
Homer.
Just
let
me
do
the
talking.
Ma'am.
What's
with
the
mask?
Second
thought,
don't
answer
that.
No,
one
thing
you
learn
in
my
business.
Killers,
preachers,
Every
man
has
his
thing.

Railroaders?

No.

Come
to
think
of
it,
there
was
talk
of
an

during

Let
go

I
won't
let
you
go!
-
Whoa!
No

I

Not
if
you
favour
your

He's
a

speaks
Indian.
Never
heard
of
him.
I
see.
Well...
Coming
in
here,
of
fairly
serious
health
code
violations.
Hmm.
It
is
a
house
of
sin.
Yes,
well,
one
with
evidence
of
livestock
on
the
premises,
inadequately
marked
fire
escapes,
and
a

sinister-looking

Pickles?
Unrefrigerated.
I'd
hate
to
have
to
shut
you

You
want

-
Yes.
-
Yes.

there
ain't
no

these

What
the

is
he
talking
about?
Nothing.
It's
an
Indian
thing.
Man

has
taste
for
human
flesh.
Butch
Cavendish.
That's
right.
Well,
why
didn't
you
just
say
so?
Collins
was
in
about

you,
as
a
matter
of

Said
his

was,
uh,
Reid.
Dan

JOHN:
What

RED:

this.
Do
not

Rock

lnjun's
right.
Worthless

But

Maybe
I'll

Do
you

I

I
thought
he'd

May
I

you?
Where
are

I'm
sure
I
don't

who
you

Ma'am,
I

I've
located

Ma'am.

Get

There's
the

Where
you

Injun?
What
the

is
wrong
Blood
has
been
spilled,
kemosabe.
And
soon,
rivers
run
red.


Oh,
God...
Let's
call
it
a
night,
Joe.

Yes,
ma'am.

Come
on,
Danny.

Get

Danny,
come
on.
Pilar,
get
the

-
Pilar,
fire!


Indian
savages.
Was
not
Indian.
The
hell
it
wasn't.
Indians
make
trade.
Leave
him
alone.
I
said
leave
him
alone!
Indian
is
like
coyote.
He
kill
and
leave
nothing
to
waste.
Tell
me,
kemosabe,
what
does
the
white
man
kill
for?



This
one's
nice,
ain't
it?

I
love
me
some
aquamarine.




Not
an
Indian.
This
ain't
what
it
looks
like,
mister.
I
just
like
them
pretty
things.
Rebecca
and
Danny.
Where
are
they?
You
tell
me
where
they
are,
or
I'll
let
What
does
he
want
to
do?

-
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
There's
a
Ranger.
What
are
you
talking
about?
He
got
some
lunatic
Indian
with
him.
He
was
gonna
violate
me
You
shoot
anything
that
comes
out.

Go
for
horse,
kemosabe.
I
cover
you.I
Why
don't
I
cover
you?
You
have
been
to
the
other
side.
Spirit
Walker
cannot
be
killed.
All
right.
But
we
take
them
alive.
Texas
Ranger!
Put
down
your
weapons

It's
dark!
Spirit
Walker.
See!
What
did
I
tell
you?
Go
around
back.

What's
with
the
mask?




What
is
it?
I
So,
the
horse,
it
can
fly?
Don't
be
stupid.

JOHN:
Hold
it
right
there.
Rebecca
and
Danny,
where
are
they?
Comanche
don't
take
no
prisoners.
Just
the
scalps.

Isn't
that
right,
boy?
I
will
take
the
Spaniard.

I
haven't
fired
a
gun
Might
want
to
keep
that



Great
shot!
That
was
supposed
In
that
case,
not
so
good.
What?
Nothing.

That
was
my
brother's.
Comanche.
Very
sacred.
How
am
I
supposed
Tracks
lead
north,
That's
400
square
miles
Even
an
Indian
can't
track
through
that.
We
follow
horse,
kemosabe.

"Kemosa..."
Why
do
you
What's
that
mean?
"Wrong
brother."
Right.
My
husband
will
kill
you
for
this.
That'd
be
a
trick.
Last
time
I
saw
your
husband,
he
was
drowning
in
his
own
blood.
RAY:
We
got
company.
Hold
up!
MAN:
It's
Frank.

Where's
Barret
and
Jesus?

He
killed
them.
Straight
draw.
Fired
one
bullet
You
better
start
talking
straight,
Frank.
Now,
who
killed
them?
It
was
a
Ranger,
Butch.
A
lone
Ranger.
Rangers
are
dead.
The
ghost
of
Dan
Reid.

Frank!
He
coming
for
you.
You
shouldn't
have
done
what
you
did.
-
Shut
up!
Let
him
come!
I
killed
him
once.
I
won't
have
to
answer
for
it
Scared,
aren't
you?
You
should
be.
Hey,
Collins.
Do
you
know
"The
Valley
of
Tears."
Please
don't
do
this.
Please,
don't...

Mmm!
That's
far
enough.

Don't
look
at
me.
He
loved
you.
I
said,
don't
look
at
me.

Run.
Please,
run.
Danny,
come
on.


-
Mama?
JOHN:
Why
would
Cavendish
like
the
Comanche
violated
the
treaty?
It
has
something
to
do
with
what
my
brother
found
in
the
desert.
Perhaps
he
want
to
make
it
look
like
Comanche
violate
treaty.
JOHN:
That's
very
helpful,
thank
you.
Whoa.
What
is
it?

Horse
dead.
I
can
see
that.
Now
what?
We're
lost,
aren't
we?
I
knew
it.
Just
follow
the
horse.
But
you
can't
talk
You
know
what?
Let
me
try.
Hello.
If
you
could
we'll
take
it
from
here.
What's
that?
Nothing!
That's
just
fantastic,
isn't
it?
doing
God-knows-what
and
I'm
gonna
die
and
that
ridiculous
bird!
The
woman,
Rebecca,
you
will
fill
her
with
child,
no?
What?
No!
That's
my
brother's
wife.
When
you
were
on
the
other
side,
you
spoke
of
her
in
your
vision.
Well,
lack
of
oxygen
Everyone
knows
that.
Yes,
but
you
did
not
speak
of
her
Well,
she's
his
widow
now.
So,
it
is
better
that
Yes.
No.
Look,
it
just
isn't
done.
Because
I
am
a
savage?

Would
you
stop?
You
can't
track.
If
you
could,
we
wouldn't
be
What
is
that?
Track!
That's
impossible.

Train
track.
You
are
lost,
aren't
you?
Train
tracks?
I
thought
you
were
in
Indian
territory.
Yes.




Let
the
Comanche
make
no
mistake.
We
will
not
be
dissuaded
from
our
task.
-
all
treaties
with
the
Indian
Nation
are
null
and
void.
We
will
be
in
Promontory
Summit
ahead
of

three
days
from
today!
Now,
go
ahead.
Put
that
in
your
paper.

MAN:
Mr
Cole!
Mr
Cole!
Sir?
It
arrived
last
night.
I
had
to
dip
into
petty
cash.
Put
it
somewhere
safe.
Where
would
that
be?
Use
your
imagination.

I
understand
you
have
Right
on
time.




I
thought
you
said
I
couldn't
get
shot.
No.
I
said
you
could
not
be
killed.
Oh.
JOHN:
Apache?
TONTO:
Comanche.
Well,
that's
good,
right?
Not
so
much.
What
are
they
doing?
TONTO:
Death
dance.
They
are
preparing
for
war
War?
Wait.
Is
that
thing
sterile?
Yes.
I
make
urine
on
it.
What?

-
War?
But
the
Comanche
didn't
White
man
does
not
know
this.
But
you're
going
to
tell
them.
I
mean,
you
did
tell
them,
right?

My
name's
John
Reid,
and
I
know
that
you
didn't
If
you
let
me
go,
I
can
prove
it.

doesn't

to

Of
course

don't.

with

of
respect?
What's
with
the
mask?
What?
Tonto
told
you
these
things?
That's
right.
And
he
told
you
to
wear
the
mask?

That's
funny?
Very
funny.
JOHN:
Tonto's
a
Comanche.
He's
one
of
you.
No
more.
What
do
you
mean?
His
mind
is
broken.
He
is
a
band
apart.
Many
moons
ago,
a
boy
found
two
white
men
He
brought
them
to
When
they
found
silver
in
the
river,
they
asked
the
boy
where
it
came
from.
In
exchange
for
a
cheap
pocket
watch
from
Sears
Roebuck,
the
boy
showed
them
where
they
found
more
silver
than
any
white
man
had
ever
seen.
They
took
what
they
could
carry,
but
they
wanted
to
so
they
could
one
day
return.

The
boy
could
not
live
so
he
decided
the
men
were
possessed
by
evil
spirits
in
the
silver.
He
called
it
"windigo,"
like
the
ghost
stories
And
he
made
a
vow.
When
he
found
these
two
men,
he
would
drain
their
blood
into
the
soil
of
his
ancestors,
so
he
could
return
to
the
tribe.
But
he
is
too
late.
There
is
no
more
tribe
to
return
to.
Our
time
has
passed.
They
call
it
"progress."
You're
John
Reid,
brother
of
Dan.
Yes.
By
this
totem,
your
brother
swore
if
we
kept
the
peace,
he
would
protect
our
land.
Now
the
Cavalry
cut
down
our
children.
Like
all
white
men,
your
brother
lied.
No.
No,
Dan
was
murdered.
And
if
you
let
me
go,
So,
we
have
a
deal?
Not
so
much.
My
name
come
up?


Please,
this
is
a
mistake.
There
doesn't
need
to
be
a
war.
It
makes
no
difference.
We
are
already
ghosts.

Over
here!
Wait!
Perhaps
they
didn't
see
us.
Oh,
no.
They
will
be
back
any
minute
now.
Could
be
worse.
Worse?
How
could
this
be
worse?
Could
develop
an
itch
on
your
nose.
I'm
not
talking
to
you
any
more.


What
is
that?
You
hear
it,
too?
I
was
hoping
it
was
in
my
head.
This
is
worse.

Uh-huh.
To

and
Danny?
Yup.
-
To
capture
Cavendish?
Hmm.

Exactly.

is

to
die.
Yeah,

Come
on.

I
have
to
ask
twice?

don't

and

out

Yeah.

years

SHOUTING
-
Daddy!
We
don't
know
who's
out
there.
I
intend
to
find
out.
JOHN:
Latham
Cole!
Wendell,
take
Mrs
Reid
For
their
own
safety.
What
is
it,
friend?

This
is
the
man
you've
been
looking
for.

COLE:
Butch
Cavendish,
just
like
one
of
those
great
lizards
buried
in
the
desert.
The
last
of
a
dying
breed.

JOHN:
That's
enough.
I
brought
this
man
in
for
justice
Of
course.
Soldier.
I'm
just
doing
my
job,
Mrs
Reid.
You
wanna
keep
me
in
this
room,
you're
gonna
have
to
shoot
me.
Is
that
part
of
your
job?
Whoa!
Danny.
And
don't
let
him
leave.
But
he's
just
a
boy.
That's
right.
Oh.
And
he's
got
a
twitchy
finger,
too.



Stupid
white
man.

COLE:
There
were
rumours
A
lone
Ranger,
a
masked
man.

A
ghost,
some
people
said.
And
now,
here
you
are.
Flesh
and
blood.
Civilised
society
COLE:
Of
course
not.
How
can
I
thank
you
You
can
stop
this
war
before
it's
too
late.
Comanche
didn't
attack
It
was
Butch
Cavendish
and
his
gang.
All
for
this.
COLE:
Butch
Cavendish.
In
one
man,
everything
I
hate
about
this
country.
No
sense
of
the
common
good.
No
vision.
Come
to
think
of
it,
not
unlike
your
brother,
Dan.


Men
like
that
can't
accept
A
man
can't
stay
the
same
with
the
world
evolving
around
him.
Remember
me?
But
a
man
can't
choose
It's
almost
as
if
his
brother
chooses
him.
You
see,
that's
what
we
are.
Me
and
Butch.
Brothers.
Born
in
the
desert.
All
those
years
ago.

JOHN:
And
now
you've
come
back.
Train
tracks.
That's
what
Dan
found
He
knew
there
was
gonna
be
a
war
and
he
wouldn't
go
along
with
it,
so
you
had
him
killed.
Like
I
said,
no
vision.
Stop
this
train.
Oh,
there's
no
stopping
this
train,
John.
I
think
you
know
that.

Danny!
You're
not
my
daddy.
No.
Put
the
gun
down,
son.
Where's
my
daddy?
He's
dead,
Danny.
-
He
killed
him.
Listen
to
me,
Danny.
You
remember
me,
it's
your
Uncle
John.
You
trust
me,
don't
you,
Danny?
Look,
Danny,
Nice
and
slow.
There's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
Shoot
him,
son.


Danny?
Is
my
daddy
dead?
Is
he?
Is
he?
Just
put
the
gun
down.
Please?
Now,
just
put
the
gun
down.
Captain,
arrest
these
men.
This
man
is
a
common
criminal
trespassing
on
railway
property.
JOHN:
Comanche
never
They
staged
the
attacks
COLE:
We've
heard
enough.
Captain.
You
represent
You
do
not
work
for
this
man!
-
COLE:
Captain!
Well,
if
what
you
say
is
true,
that
would
mean
COLE:
That's
right,
Captain.
Slaughter
of
the
innocents.
Their
blood
on
your
hands.
Tenfold.
Are
you
capable
of
that?
Well,
the
way
I
see
it,
these
men
are
with
the
rail
road.
So,
the
question
is,
who
the
hell
are
you?


CAVALRYMAN
1:
Clear
the
track,
men!
-
Outta
the
way!
MINER:
Going
to
pit!
FULLER:
My
God!
Out
here,
it's
just
rock.
Put
it
on
a
train,
it's
priceless.
What
could
you
buy
with
all
of
that?
A
country,
Captain.
A
great
country.
For
which
our
children
will
thank
us.
RAILWAYMAN
1:
Take
her
ahead!
You're
lined
up.
-
Get
these
Chinamen
out
of
here!
Move
it,
move
it!
Detail,
halt!
Order,
up!
Didn't
you
hear
me,
Chinaman?
I
said,
get
out!
FULLER:
Port
arms!
Please,
don't
do
this.
You'll
take
care
of
us,
like
you
said.
You
don't
have
to
do
this.
FULLER:
Load!

I
ain't
gonna
tell
you
again!
What
the
hell
is
that?
Gas.
That's
gas!
-
MAN:
What'd
he
say?
ENGINEER:
Gas!
Get
out
of
there!
She's
going
to
blow!

Shoulder
arms!
I
was
at
Gettysburg.
Twelve-thousand
casualties
Know
what
I
learned
in
all
that
carnage?
Nothing
is
accomplished

-
Leave
her
alone!
Nice
and
easy!
ENGINEER:
Gas!
Oh,
Lord!
Gas!
What
the
hell?
Gas!
Gas!
Gas!
Ready!
I'm
gonna
have

REBECCA:
No!
Aim!
Fire!
"Oh!


What
the
hell
just
happened?




Get
the
train
moving!
FULLER:
Attack!
TONTO:
Hold
on,
kemosabe.
Tonto?

What
was
that?
No
reason
for
concern.
FULLER:
Over
here!
To
the
guns!
Defensive
position!
John!
Rebecca!
I'm
coming
for
you!
John!
Rally
on
me!


Lord,
save
us.

Faster!
Now!
Form
a
firing
line!
SOLDIER:
Come
this
way.
Fall
in
on
me.
Hold
your
positions,
gentlemen!

Hold!
Steady!
For
God!
And
for
country!
Fire
at
Will!

Tonto?
What
is
that?
Now...must
to
jump!
Left
or
right?
Yes!


Kerosene?
What
are
you
trying
to
do?
Trust
me.
These
two
have

Cover
the
flank!

I
Mister
Tonto?
Mister
Tonto?
You
mean,
they
killed
all
of
them?
The
Indians,
the
settlers...
Dan?
For
silver?
JOHN'.
You
were
right.
There
is
no
justice.
Cole
controls
everything.
The
rail
road,
the
Cavalry,
everything.
If
men
like
him
represent
the
law,
I'd
rather
be
an
outlaw.
That
is
why
you
wear
the
mask.

Something
very
wrong
with
that
horse.



COLFAX:
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
we
are
here
today
to
celebrate
a
dream.
And
now
I'd
like
to
introduce
the
man
who
made
that
dream
a
reality.
Chairman
of
the
Transcontinental
Railroad
Corporation,
Mr
Lewis
Habberman
the
Third.
Thank
you!
But
I
cannot
take
credit
alone.
No,
sir.
The
working
men
before
you
-
Yes!
As
does
one
man
in
particular,
and
a
more
dedicated,
loyal
employee
the
rail
road
could
not
ask
for,
Mr
Latham
Cole!

-
Come
on.
MAN
2:
Bravo,
sir.
HABBERMAN:
Mr
Cole!
A
testament
of
our
thanks.
SHAREHOLDER:
Cheers!I


WILL:
You
missed
something.
Where
did
you
get
the
explosives?
I
told
you.
No,
you
didn't.
But
you
had
a
plan.
I
mean,
We
had
plan.
It
was
good
plan.

This
is
a
damn
bank
robbery!

Oh,
Mr
Habberman,
if
you
and
the
other
shareholders
would
like
to
follow
me,
I
have
a
little
surprise
for
you.
Ah!



Oh,
m'!-
What
was
that?
Tunnelling
for
supply
routes.
This
way,
gentlemen.
Bring
the
girl.

He's
coming
for
you.
Just
like
Frank
said.
What
you
got
makes
them
Reid
boys
so
hot
under
the
collar,
anyway?
Maybe
I'll
have
a
taste
and
find
out.
The
men
around
this
table
represent
the
finest
families
in
our
country
as
well
as
controlling
interest
in
the
Transcontinental
SHAREHOLDERS:
Hear,
hear!
COLE:
What
you
cannot
know
is
that
over
the
past
six
months,
I
have
leveraged
a
position
which
will
make
me
when
this
company
is
on
the
New
York
City
Stock
Exchange.
In
essence,
gentlemen,
you
work
for
me.
Have
you
lost
your
mind?
Do
you
have
any
idea
the
cost?
Each
one
of
those
freight
cars
contains
4.5
tons
of
purest
raw
silver.
When
it
reaches
the
bank
that's
65
million
dollars.
It's
what
you
might
call
You
can
keep
the
watch.
Have
you
checked
the
undercarriage?
-
Check
it
again.
MAN:


Oh!
FULLER:
May
I
be

I

my

SOLDIER:
Hurry

with
them
grapes.
Shh!
Make

SOLDIER:
Hey,
boy!
Boy,
I'm
talking
to
you!

Hey!
You
can't
leave
that
here!
Mr
Cole's
pickles.
Take
it
up
with
him.
This
is
an
outrage!
I,
for
one,
am
not
gonna
sit
here
and
negotiate
with
one
of
my
employees.
Then,
let's
get
down
to
it,
shall
we?


MY
gluteus!
Gentlemen,
our
chairman
-a
sudden
leave
of
absence.
Any
nominations?
I
nominate
Mr
Latham
Cole.
I
accept



FULLER:
It's
magnificent.
So
clean.
You
want
to
touch
it?
Oh,
yes.
Attention!
About
face!
RED:
Everyone
wants
to
touch
it.
What
the
hell
do
you
think
you're
doing?
Robbery.
We
don't
have
no
money
here,
boy.
Train
robbery.
A
little
higher.
How
high
does
it
go?
Almost
there.
CROWD:

of
the

of
the

Um...
Mr
Cole?
They're
stealing
my
train.
Get
the
horses!
Right
there!

What
are
you
waiting
for?
To
the
engine!
Stop
that
train!

Shoot
him,
you
idiot.

No,
Danny's
in
there!
Mama!
SOLDIER:
I've
been
shot!
-
There
he
is,
men!

John!

John!

Come
on!




Get
me
close!



The
Ranger!
He's
on
the
roof!
How
many
times
I
told
you
he'd
come.

Adios,
Counsellor!
John!


I


Dance,
monkey!
Dance!
Oh!
Ooh!
Danny!



JOHN:
Butch
Cavendish!

Let
her
go!
If
you
insist.

Go
ahead.
John?
She
tends
to
land
on
her
feet.
John!

Oh!
What
you
gonna
do,
Counsellor?
Shoot
me?

That's
right.

Guess
I
cut
out

Don't
tell
me.

What
the
hell?
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
did.


(INDISTINCT

Where
is

What?
Where's
the
silver?
What
are
you...

End
of
the
line.
We've
been
here
before,
haven't
we?
Easy.
Where
did
you
say
The
future?
Well,
this

You
know
something,
Butch?
Enjoy
the
ride!

Huh?



Hey!

Wrong
brother?
Not
today.


COLE:
Time's
up,
Indian.
Uncle
John!

Pretty
soon,
no
one
will
even
know
I'm
a
Spirit
Walker.
I
can't
miss.

All
these
years,
I
think
you
are
windigo.
But,
no.
You
are
just
another
white
man.
Who
are
you?
Bad
trade.
WILL:
You
let
him
get
away?
No.
The
bridge.
What
bridge?
Oh,
m'!-
"Bad
trade."




Ladies
and
gentlemen,
as

like
to
express
our
gratitude
to
this
masked
man,
this
Lone
Ranger.

MAN:

A
small
token
of
our
thanks.
(CROWD
APPLAUDS
There
will
be
plenty
more
Always
nice
to
have
a
lawman
Time
to
take
off
the
mask,
son.
Not
yet.

I
can't
stay.
I
know.
But
if
that
badge
well,
you
know
where
to
find
us.
Train's
headed
west.
There's
nothing
It's
my
home.
JOHN:
You're
not
a
boy
Your
daddy
would
be
proud.
You
take
care
of
your
mama.
I
thought
I'd
call
him
Silver.
Silver?
It
is
a
good
name.
You
know,
it
isn't
really
a
trade
unless
both
parties
agree.
Who
would
really
trade
Bird
cannot
tell
time,
kemosabe.
"Kemosabe."
Yeah,
about
that.
Look,
I
was
thinking,
I'm
gonna
need
a
better
name.
I
was
thinking,
"The
Mask
of
Justice."
TONTO'.
No.
JOHN:
What
about,
TONTO'.
No.
JOHN:
Do
you
know

I
guess
I
should
be
heading
home.
TONTO:
Home.
It
was
nice
to
meet
you,
Mr
Tonto.
So,
the
windigo.
Nature
out
of
balance.
The
masked
man.
It's
just
a
story,
right?

I
mean,
Was
he?
Up
to
you,
kemosabe.

Never
take
off
the
mask.

Hi-yo,
Silver!
Away!
Don't
ever
do
that
again.
Sorry.
