it
be

the
task
of
nursing
me...

...has
become
wearisome
for
you?
Oh,
no.
No,
no,
my
Lord
Voldemort.
I
only
meant...
...perhaps
if
we
were
to
do
it
No!
The
boy
is
everything!
It
cannot
be
done
without
him.
Exactly
as
I
said.
-I
will
not
disappoint
you,
my

First,

I'll

think
you're
in

we're
apart

There!
All

ARTHUR:
Who?
I
don't

I
didn't
see
his
face.

WOMAN:
Anything
from
the
trolley?
Anything
from
the

RON:
...and
a
Licorice

there
any

Loads,

to

worried

so
much.
It's
hurting
again,
isn't
it?
I'm

Dumbledore
asked
me.
Any

it
comes
to
the
Dark
Arts...

believe
in
a
practical
approach.
But
first,
which
of
you
can
tell
me
-Three,
sir.
Because
they
are
unforgivable.
Will
earn
you
a
one-way
ticket

says
you're
too
young
I
say
different!

need
to
know

need
to
be
prepared.

need
to
find
another

No
way.

codger
MOODY:
So
which
curse
shall
we
see
first?
-Weasley!
Stand.
Give
us
a
curse.
Well,
my
dad
did
tell
me
about
one.
The
Imperius
Curse.
Oh,
yeah,
your
father
Gave
the
Ministry
quite
a
bit
of
grief
Perhaps
this
will
show
you
why.

Hello.
Lovely
little
beauty.

Engorgio.
Imperio!

MOODY:
If
she
bites...
...she's
lethal.

What
are
you
laughing
at?
Get
off!
Talented,
isn't
she?
What
should
I
have
her
do
next?
Drown
herself?
Scores
of
witches
and
wizards
...that
they
only
did
...under
the
influence
But
here's
the
rub:
How
do
we
sort
out
the
liars?
Another,
another.
Up,
up.
Come
on.
Longbottom,
is
it?
Up.
Professor
Sprout
tells
me
There's
the....
The
Cruciatus
Curse.
Correct,
correct.
Come,
come.
Particularly
nasty.
The
torture
curse.
Crucio!

Stop
it!

you
see

Perhaps
you
could
give
us
the
last
No?
Avada
Kedavra!
The
Killing
Curse.
Only
one
person
is
known
...and
he's
sitting
in
this
room.

RON:
Completely
demented,
of
course,
and
...but
he's
really
been
there,
you
know?
There's
a
reason
those
curses
To
perform
them
in
a
classroom....

all
right?
Come
on.
We'll
have
a
cup
of
tea.

is

drew
it
himself.

like
Dumbledore
...by
a
dodge
as
pathetically
dimwitted

that's
why
it's
so
brilliant.
-Ready,

BOTH:
-Yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
Ready?
FRED

got
one
for
each
of
us.
Are
you
serious?
And
Fleur
and
Krum,
do
they--?
-Yes.
CEDRIC:
Right.
BOY
1:
Read
the
badges,
Potter!
-I've
asked
them
not
to
wear
them,
but--
It's
not
like
I
try
It
just
happens
a
fair
bit.
You
have
to
admit,
though,
You're
a
right
foul
git,
you
know
that?
-You
think
so?
Anything
else?
-Yeah.
Stay
away
from
me.
CRABBE:
There's
Potter.
Cheat.
My
father
and
I
have
a
bet,
you
see.
I
don't
think
you're
gonna
last
He
disagrees.
I
don't
give
a
damn
He's
vile
and
cruel.
-Pathetic?
Aah!
MOODY:
I'll
teach
you
to
curse
someone
You
stinking,
cowardly,
scummy...
-Professor
Moody!
-What
are
you
doing?
-Is
that
a--?
Is
that
a
student?
Oh!
Ah!
Stand
still!
Stand
still!
-My
father
will
hear
about
this!
-Professor
Moody!
Professor!
I
could
tell
you
stories
about
your
father
-Alastor!
Alastor.
We
never
use
transfiguration
Surely
Dumbledore
told
you
that.
-He
might've
mentioned
it.
Away!
You.
Come
with
me.


That's
a
Foe-Glass.
Lets
me
keep
an
eye
on
my
enemies.
If
I
can
see
the
whites
of
their
eyes,

Wouldn't
even
bother
telling
you
You
wouldn't
believe
it
if
I
did.
Now...
...what
are
you
going
to
do
Oh,
um....
Well,
you
know,
I
just
thought
I'd....
Sit.
Listen
to
me,
Potter.
Your
pal
Diggory?
By
your
age,
he
could
turn
a
whistle
into
Miss
Delacour?
She's
as
much
a
fairy
princess
as
I
am.
As
for
Krum,
his
head
...but
Karkaroff's
is
not.
They'll
have
a
strategy.
And
you
can
bet
that
it
will
Come
on,
Potter.
What
are
your
strengths?
Um....
I
don't
know.
Well,
I
can
fly.
-Better
than
fair,
the
way
I
heard
it.
You're
allowed
a
wand.
FRED:
GEORGE:
Step
up,
folks!
Who
fancies
a
flutter
Smart
money's
on
Krum
to
survive!
Yes,
sir?
Ten-to-1
for
Fleur.
There
you
go.
DUMBLEDORE:
This
is
a
great
day
for
all
of
us.

Each
of
the
three
tasks
involves
-Please
keep
your
seats
at
all
times.
This
will
minimize
any
risks
-Harry?
Is
that
you?
I'm
sure
we
all
wish
our
champions...
-How
are
you
feeling?
Okay?
The
key
is
to
concentrate.
Battle
a
dragon.

RITA:
Oh,
how...
...stirring.
If
everything
goes
unfortunately
today...
...you
two
may
even
You
have
no
business
here.
This
tent
is
for
champions...
...and
friends.
No
matter.
We've
got
what
we
wanted.
Good
day,
champions.
Now,
you've
waited,
you've
wondered,
A
moment
only
four
of
you
What
are
you
doing
here,
Miss
Granger?
Oh,
um,
sorry,
I'll
just
go.
Barty,
the
bag.
Champions,
in
a
circle
around
me.
Miss
Delacour,
over
here.
Mr.
Krum.
And,
Potter,
Mr.
Potter,
over
here.
...Miss
Delacour,
if
you
will.

CROUCH:

Mr.
Krum.
The
Chinese
Fireball.
Ooh.
The
Swedish
Short-Snout.
-Which
leaves....
-What's
that,
boy?

CROUCH:

These
represent
four
...each
of
which
has
been
given
Your
objective
is
simple:
Collect
the
egg.
This
you
must
do,
...without
which
you
cannot
hope
Any
questions?
Very
well.
Good
luck,
champions.
Mr.
Diggory,
at
the
sound
of
the
cannon,


CROWD
:
DUMBLEDORE:
Three
of
our
champions
...and
so
each
one
of
them
And
now
our
fourth
CROWD
:
CROWD:




Aah!

Your
wand,
Harry!
Your
wand!
Accio
Firebolt!

-Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
Ooh.
Oh,
my
God.

-Yeah!
Whoo!




Aah!






Yes!
Yes!

-Yes,
Harry!
-Or
an
arm.
BOTH:
SEAMUS:
Go
on,
Harry.
What's
the
clue?
-Who
wants
me
to
open
it?
-Do
you
want
me
to
open
it?


What
the
bloody
hell
was
that?
All
right,
everyone!
This
is
gonna
be
uncomfortable
enough
I
reckon
you
have
to
be
barking
mad
to
Caught
on,
have
you?
I
wasn't
the
only
one
Everyone
was
saying
it
Brilliant.
-Least
I
warned
you
about
the
dragons.
No,
no,
no,
I
did.
No,
don't
you
remember?
...that
Seamus
told
me
that
Parvati
Seamus
never
actually
told
me
anything,
I
thought
we'd
be
all
right,
you
know...
...after
you'd
figured
that
out.
Who--?
Who
could
possibly
That's
completely
mental.
Yeah.
Isn't
it?
I
suppose
I
was
a
bit
distraught.
Boys.


BOTH:
Cho,
Harry's
looking
at
you.
CHO:
HERMIONE:
I
can't
believe
it!
She's
done
it
again.
"Miss
Granger,
...seems
to
be
developing
a
taste
Her
latest
prey,

other
than

you,
Mr.
Weasley.
Oh,
thank
you,
Nigel.

Not
now,
Nigel.
Later.
Go
on.
I
told
him
I'd
get
him
Harry's
autograph.
Oh,
look,
Mum's
sent
me
something.
Mum
sent
me
a
dress.
Well,
it
does
match
your
eyes.
Nose
down,
Harry.
-Ginny,
these
must
be
for
you.
What
are
you
on
about?
They're
not
for
Ginny.
They're
for
you.
-Dress
robes.
McGONAGALL:

...of
the
Triwizard
Tournament...
...since
its
inception.
On
Christmas
Eve
night,
...gather
in
the
Great
Hall...
...for
a
night
of
well-mannered
frivolity.
As
representatives
of
the
host
school...
...I
expect
each
and
every
one
of
you
And
I
mean
this
literally,
because...
...the
Yule
Ball
is,
first
and
foremost...
...a
dance.


Silence!
The
house
of
Godric
Gryffindor

the
wizard
world
I
will
not
have

in
the
course
of
a

behaving
like
a
babbling,
Try
saying
that
five
times
fast,
huh?
McGONAGALL:
...is
to
let
the
body
breathe.
Inside
every
girl,
...longing
to
burst
forth
Something's
about
to
burst
out
of
Eloise
Inside
every
boy,
-Mr.
Weasley.
Will
you
join
me,
please?
Now,
place
your
right
hand
-Where?

And
extend
your
arm.
Mr.
Filch,
if
you
please.

One,
two,
three.
One,
two,
three.
One,
two,
three.

HARRY:
Never
gonna
let
him
forget
this,
BOTH:
McGONAGALL:
Boys,
on
your
feet!

Why
do
they
have
to
travel
in
packs?
How
are
you
supposed
to
get
one
Blimey,
Harry.
You've
slayed
dragons.
I
think
I'd
take
the
dragon
right
now.
I
take
after
my
mum.
Though
I
didn't
know
her
very
well.
No,
not
the
maternal
sort,
her.
Broke
me
dad's
heart,
though.
I
could
pick
him
up
at
the
age
of
6
with
He
laughed
so
hard
at
that.
Very
funny.
And
then
he
died
So
I
sort
of
had
to
make
But
enough
of
me.
What
about
you?


This
is
mad.
At
this
rate,
we'll
be
Well,
us
and
Neville.
Yeah,
but,
then
again,
It
might
interest
you
to
know

Now
I'm
really
depressed.

"Get
a
move
on
or
all
Who
you
going
with,
then?
FRED:
Oi,
Angelina?

To
the
ball?
Yeah,
all
right.
Oi,
Hermione.
You're
a
girl.
Very
well
spotted.
Come
with
one
of
us?

Come
on.
It's
one
thing
for
a
bloke
For
a
girl,
it's
just
sad.
I
won't
be
going
alone,
because,
And
I
said
yes!
Bloody
hell.
She's
lying,
right?
If
you
say
so.
RON:
Look,
we've
just
gotta
Tonight,
when
we
get
back
...we'll
both
have
partners.
Agreed?
Agreed.



-Cho!

Um,
watch
yourself
on
the
stairs.
Okay,
thanks.
Cho?
-Yes?
Well,
I
just
wondered
if
you--

I
wondered
if
maybe
Sorry,
I
didn't
catch
that.
I
was
just
wondering
if
maybe
Oh,
um....
Harry...
...I'm
sorry,
but
someone's
And....
Well,
I've
said
I'll
go
with
him.
Okay.
Yeah.
Great.
Fine.
No
problem.
Okay.
Good.
Harry?
I
really
am...
...sorry.

It's
all
right,
Ron.
It's
okay,
Ron.
It's
all
right.
HARRY:
He
just
asked
Fleur
Delacour
out.
-What?
No,
of
course.
-She
said
yes?
There
she
was,
walking
by.
I
couldn't
help
it.
Actually,
he
sort
of
screamed
at
her.
-And
what
did
you
do
then?
I'm
not
cut
out
for
this,
Harry.
BOTH:
RON:
I
always
liked
looking
at
them
She's
never
gonna
forgive
me,
ever.
Hey!


RON:
Bloody
hell.
Bloody....
Oh,
bloody....
What
are
those?
What
are
those?
-My
dress
robes.
No
lace.
No
dodgy
little
collar.
Well,
I
expect
yours
are
more
traditional.
Traditional?!
They're
ancient!

I
smell
like
my
Great
Aunt
Tessie.
Murder
me,
Harry.
Leave
it
alone!
Poor
kid.
I
bet
she's
alone
in
her
room,
-Who?
Come
on,
Harry,
why
do
you
think
she
Because
we'd
take
the
mickey
out
of
her
Nobody
asked
her.
Would've
taken
her
BOTH:
Don't
you
look...
...dashing.
There
you
are,
Potter.
-Ready,
professor?
It's
traditional
that
the
three
champions--
--are
the
first
to
dance.
-Surely
I
told
you
that.
Oh,
well,
now
you
know.
Oh.
As
for
you,
Mr.
Weasley,
you
may
proceed
-Oh,
there
you
are.
McGONAGALL:
Oh,
come
on.
Hi.
Now,
I
need
you
all
to
line
up
Oh,
you
are
very
late.
This
way.
This
way.
Come
along.
She
looks
beautiful!
Yeah,
she
does.


Is
that
Hermione
Granger?
No.
Absolutely
not.
Hi!

Harry,
take
my
waist.
-What?



Ooh.
MAN:

Learning
to
rock
and
roll
Spin
around
like
a
crazy
elf
Dancing
by
himself
Boogie
down
like
a
unicorn
No
stopping
till
the
break
of
dawn
Put
your
hands
up
in
the
air
Like
an
ogre
who
just
don
't
care
Can
you
dance
like
a
Hippogriff?
Ruddy
pumpkinhead,
isn't
he?
I
don't
think
it
was
the
books
May
I
have
your
arm?
Arm.
Leg.
I'm
yours.
Hot,
isn't
it?
Viktor's
gone
to
go
and
get
drinks.
No,
we'd
not
care
to
join
you
and
Viktor.
What's
got
your
wand
in
a
knot?
He's
a
Durmstrang.
The
enemy?
Besides,
the
whole
point
...is
international
...to
make
friends.
I
think
he's
got
a
bit
more
Are
you
going
to
ask
me
No.
-He's
using
you.
-Besides,
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
-What?!
What?
That's
what
you
think?
You
know
the
solution
then,
don't
you?
-Go
on.
...pluck
up
the
courage
and
ask
me
And
not
as
a
last
resort.
Well,
that's--
I
mean,
Harry.
Where
have
you
been?
Never
mind!
Off
to
bed,
both
of
you.

-They
get
scary
when
they
get
older.
What's
this
about?

SINGER:
This
magic
die
The
answer's
there


VOLDEMORT:
Yes,
the
time
is
close
now.
Harry,
at
last!
Step
aside,
Wormtail,


You
all
right,
Harry?
I
just
got
in.
Me.

HERMIONE:
Harry,
you
told
me
-The
task
is
two
days
from
now.
I
suppose
Viktor's
Wouldn't
know.
We
don't
actually
Actually,
we
don't
really
talk
at
all.

I
just
mean
he's
not
-Mm-hm.
It's
a
bit
annoying,
actually.
You
are
trying
to
figure
this
egg
out,
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
It
just
means
these
tasks
...in
the
most
brutal
way.
And...
...I'm
scared
for
you.
You
got
by
the
dragons
I'm
not
sure
it's
going
CEDRIC:
-Potter!
How--?
How
are
you?
Spectacular.
I
realize
I
never
really
thanked
you
properly
Forget
it.
I'm
sure
you
Exactly.
You
know
the
Prefects'
bathroom
It's
not
a
bad
place
for
a
bath.
Just
take
your
egg...
...and
mull
things
over
I
must
be
out
of
my
mind.

I'm
definitely
out
of
my
mind.

I'd
try
putting
it
in
the
water
Myrtle!
Hello,
Harry.
Long
time
no
see.
Oh.

I
was
circling
a
blocked
drain
...and
could
swear
I
saw
a
bit
Not
being
a
bad
boy
again,
Polyjuice
Potion?
Kicked
the
habit.
Myrtle,
did
you
say,


That's
what
he
did.
The
other
boy...
...the
handsome
one...
...Cedric.
Well,
go
on.
Open
it.
WOMAN
:
Come
seek
us
We
cannot
sing
An
hour
long
you'll
have
to
look
To
recover
what
we
took


Myrtle...
...there
aren't
merpeople
Oh,
very
good.
It
took
Cedric
ages
to
riddle
it
out.
Almost
all
the
bubbles
were
gone.



Oh,
Harry.
Harry,
tell
me
again.

"Come
seek
us
The
Black
Lake,
that's
obvious.
"An
hour
long
you'll
have
to
look."
Again,
obvious.
Though,
admittedly,
"Potentially
problematic"?
When's
the
last
time
you
held
your
breath
Look,
Harry,
we
can
do
this.
MOODY:
Professor
McGonagall
Not
you,
Potter,
But,
sir,
the
second
task
Exactly.
Presumably
Potter
...and
could
do
with
Go.
Now!
Longbottom!
Why
don't
you
help
Potter
You
know,
...you'd
be
better
off
with
Do
you
know
there's
a
wizard
in
Nepal
Neville,
no
offense,
...about
plants.
Now,
if
there's...
...a
Tibetan
turnip
that
will
allow
me
...then
great.
But
otherwise--
I
don't
know
about
a
turnip.
-Any
bets?
Any
bets?
Step
up,
mates!
Don't
be
shy.
-Three
lads.
-Four
go
down.
Don't
be
so
mean.
-Any
bets?
HARRY:
You're
sure
about
this,
Neville?
HARRY:
For
an
hour?
Most
likely?
Well,
there
is
some
debate
...as
to
the
effects
of
fresh
water
You're
telling
me
this
now?
I
just
wanted
to
help.
Well,
that
makes
you
a
right
sight
Where
are
they
anyway?
-You
seem
a
little
tense,
Harry.
DUMBLEDORE:
Last
night,
something
was
stolen
A
treasure
of
sorts.
These
four
treasures,
...now
lie
on
the
bottom
In
order
to
win...
...each
champion
need
only
find
-Simple
enough,
except
for
this:
They
will
have
but
one
hour
to
do
so,
After
that,
they'll
be
on
their
own.
You
may
begin


-What's
the
matter
with
him?
Oh,
my
God.
SEAMUS:
What?



Oh!

DUMBLEDORE:
The
Beauxbatons
...has
unfortunately
...so
she
will
take
no
further
part




But
she's
my
friend
too!

Only
one!




Let's
get
down
below.







-Yes!

Ascendio!
Harry!
He's
all
right.
He's
all
right.
Barty!
SEAMUS:
Go
get
him
another
towel.
You
saved
her,
even
though
My
little
sister.
Thank
you.
And
you!
You
helped.
Well,
yeah,
a
bit.

Merci.
-Harry!
Are
you
all
right?
You
must
be
freezing.
Personally,
I
think
I
finished
last,
Hermione.
Ah!
Next
to
last.
KARKAROFF:
-Come
on!
Come
on!
Attention!
The
winner
is
Mr.
Diggory...
...who
showed
innate
command
However,
seeing
as
Mr.
Potter
...had
it
not
been
for
his
determination
...but
the
others
as
well,
...second
place...
-Yes!
...for
outstanding
moral
fiber!
Yes!
Oh!
-Right
on.
-It's
great.
Blimey.
Even
when
you
go
wrong,
-Yeah,
well
done,
Moral
Fiber.
-A
fine
achievement.
Well
done,
boy.
RON:
See
you
at
Hagrid's,
Harry.
After
all,
your
story
is
one
Quite
remarkable,
really.
...to
lose
one's
family.
Never
whole
again,
are
we?
Still,
life
goes
on...
...and
here
we
stand.
I'm
sure
your
parents
would
be
Bartemius!
Not
trying
to
lure
Potter
into
one
of
the
The
last
boy
who
went
into

And
they
say
I'm
mad.
Now,
I
remember--
Biggest
bunch
of

Suppose
you
remind
me

we
all
are,
four
years
later.
Well,
maybe,
And
Harry,
of
course.
Soon
to
be
the
youngest
Hooray!
ALL
:
Hoggy
Warty
Hogwarts
Teach
us
something,
please

HARRY:
DUMBLEDORE:
And
he
won't
be
the
last.
FUDGE:
In
times
like
these,
the
wizard
world
looks
DUMBLEDORE:
The
Triwizard
Tournament
will
not
be
DUMBLEDORE:
A
true
leader
does
what
-What
did
you
say
to
me?
It
may
interest
you
to
know
Oh,
Harry!
Harry,
how
good
to
see
you
again.
I
can
come
back
later,
professor.
Not
necessary,
Harry.
The
minister
and
I
Minister,
after
you.
There
you
are.
Your
hat.
Oh,
Harry,
do
feel
free
to
indulge
in
But
I
have
to
warn
you,
Aah!




Professor?
-Professor.
Igor
Karkaroff,
you
have
been
brought
...to
present
evidence
to
this
council.
Should
your
testimony
...council
may
be
prepared
Until
such
time,
you
remain
in
the
eyes
Do
you
accept
these
terms?
-I
do,
sir.
I
have
names,
sir.
There
was
Rosier,
Evan
Rosier.
-Rosier
is
dead.
-...though,
didn't
he?
CROUCH:
If
that
is
all
the
witness
has--
There
was
Rookwood!
He
was
a
spy.
Augustus
Rookwood?
KARKAROFF:
He
passed
information
to
You-Know-Who
Very
well.
Council
will
deliberate.
In
the
meantime,
No!
Wait,
please!
Please,
I
have
more!
As
the
council
is
aware,
Severus
Snape
was
indeed
a
Death
Eater
-...turned
spy
for
us
at
great
personal
risk.
-Today
he's
no
more
a
Death
Eater
than
l.
Silence!
Unless
the
witness
possesses
...this
session
is
now
concluded.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
I've
heard
about
one
more.
CROUCH:
What's
that?
-Yes?
...this
person
took
part
...and,
by
means
...torture
of
the
Auror
Frank
Longbottom
CROUCH:
The
name.
KARKAROFF:

...Junior.

MAN:
Get
your
filthy
hands
off
me,
Hello,
Father.
You
are
no
son
of
mine.


Curiosity
is
not
a
sin,
Harry.
It's
a
Pensieve.
Very
useful
if,
like
me,
It
allows
me
to
see
once
more
You
see,
Harry,
I
have
searched
...some
small
detail...
...something
I
might
have
overlooked...
...something
that
would
explain
why
Every
time
I
get
close
to
an
answer,
It's
maddening.
Sir?
Mr.
Crouch's
son.
What
exactly
happened
to
him?
He
was
sent
to
Azkaban.
But
he
had
no
choice.
-Why
do
you
ask?
I
had
a
dream
about
him.
It
was
in
the
summer,
before
school.
In
the
dream,
I
was
in
a
house.
And
Voldemort
was
there,
And
Wormtail
was
there
too.
DUMBLEDORE:
Yes.
Always
the
same
one.
Sir,
these
dreams...
...what
I
see,
you
don't
think
I
think
it's
unwise
for
you
I
think
it's
best
if
you
simply...
...cast
them
away.
KARKAROFF:

You
know
what
it
means
as
well
as
l.
Potter!
What's
your
hurry?
Congratulations,
your
performance
Gillyweed,
am
I
correct?
Yes,
sir.
Ingenious.
A
rather
rare
herb,
gillyweed.
Not
something
found
Nor
is
this.
Know
what
it
is?
Bubble
juice,
sir?
Veritaserum.
Three
drops
of
this
and
You-Know-Who
The
use
of
it
on
a
student
is,
...should
you
ever
steal
...my
hand
might
just
slip
over
-I
haven't
stolen
anything.
Gillyweed
may
be
innocuous,
You
and
your
little
friends
are
brewing
...I'm
going
to
find
out
why!



-Yeah!
Sonorus!

Earlier
today,
Professor
Moody
placed
Only
he
knows
its
exact
position.

...and
Mr.
Potter...

...are
tied
for
first
position...
...they
will
be
the
first
to
enter
the
maze,

-...and
Miss
Delacour.
DUMBLEDORE:
The
first
person
I've
instructed
the
staff
Should,
at
any
point,
a
contestant
wish
...he
or
she
need
only
send
up
Contestants!
Gather
around.
Quickly!
In
the
maze,
you'll
find
no
dragons
Instead,
you'll
face
something
You
see,
people
change
in
the
maze.
Oh,
find
the
cup
if
you
can.
But
be
very
wary,
you
could
just
Champions,
prepare
yourselves!
Good
luck.
-My
boy.
On
the
count
of
three.
One--








Fleur?
Fleur.
Periculum!



CEDRIC:
Get
down!
Expelliarmus!

No,
don't!
Stop!
-Get
off
me!

HARRY:


Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Reducto!


-Th--
Thanks.
You
know,
for
a
moment
there,
For
a
moment,
so
did
l.
Some
game,
huh?
Some
game.


Go!
Go
on,
take
it.
-Together.
One,
two...
-...three!

-You
okay?
Where
are
we?

I've
been
here
before.
It's
a
Portkey.
-Harry,
the
cup
is
a
Portkey.
Cedric!
We
have
to
get
back
What
are
you
talking
about?



-Harry!
What
is
it?
-Who
are
you?
What
do
you
want?
-Avada
Kedavra!

Do
it!
Now!

Bone
of
the
father...
...unwillingly
given.
Flesh
of
the
servant...
...willingly
sacrificed.

And
blood
of
the
enemy...

-...forcibly
taken.

The
Dark
Lord
shall
rise...
-...again.





My
wand,
Wormtail.
Hold
out
your
arm.
Master.
Thank
you,
master.
The
other
arm,
Wormtail.


Welcome,
my
friends.
Thirteen
years
it's
been,
and
yet...
...here
you
stand
before
me
I
confess
myself...
...disappointed.
Not
one
of
you
tried
to
find
me.
Crabbe!
Macnair!
Goyle!
Not
even
you...
...Lucius.
My
Lord,
had
I
detected
any
sign,
There
were
signs,
my
slippery
friend.
I
assure
you,
my
Lord,
The
face
I
have
been
obliged
to
present
...that
is
my
true
mask.
I
returned.

Out
of
fear,
not
loyalty.
Still,
you
have
proved
yourself
useful
Thank
you,
master.
Thank
you.
VOLDEMORT:
-Such
a
handsome
boy.
VOLDEMORT:
I'd
almost
forgotten
you
were
here.
Standing
on
the
bones
I'd
introduce
you...
...but
word
has
it
you're
almost
The
boy
who
lived.
How
lies
have
fed
your
legend,
Harry.
Shall
I
reveal
what
really
happened
Shall
I
divulge
how
Yes,
shall
I?
It
was
love.
You
see,
when
dear,
sweet
Lily
Potter
...she
provided
the
ultimate
protection.
I
could
not
touch
him.
It
was
old
magic.
Something
I
should
have
foreseen.
But
no
matter,
no
matter.
Things
have
changed.
I
can
touch
you...
...now.


Yeah.

Astonishing
what
a
few
drops
Pick
up
your
wand,
Potter.
I
said,
pick
it
up!
Get
up!
Get
up!
You've
been
taught
how
to
duel,
First,
we
bow
to
each
other.
Come
on,
now,
Harry.
Dumbledore
wouldn't
want
you
I
said,
bow.

-That's
better.
And
now....
Crucio!
Crucio!
Attaboy,
Harry.
Your
parents
would
be
proud.
Especially
your
filthy
Muggle
mother.
Expelliar--
I'm
going
to
kill
you,
Harry
Potter.
I'm
going
to
destroy
you.
After
tonight,
no
one
will
ever
again
After
tonight,
if
they
speak
of
you...
...they'll
speak
only
of
how
you...
...begged
for
death.
And
l,
being
a
merciful
Lord...
...obliged.
Get
up!

Don't
you
turn
your
back
on
me,
I
want
you
to
look
at
me
I
want
to
see
the
light


Have
it
your
way.
-Expelliarmus!
Do
nothing!
He's
mine
to
finish!

He's
mine!


Harry,
when
the
connection
is
broken,
We
can
linger
for
a
moment
...but
only
a
moment.
CEDRIC:
Take
my
body
back
to
my
father.
Let
go.
Sweetheart,
you're
ready.
Let
go!
Let
go!
Accio!
No!


AMOS:

DUMBLEDORE:
Harry!
No!
No!
No,
don't!
For
God's
sake,
Dumbledore,
He's
back.
He's
back.
Voldemort's
back.
Cedric,
he
asked
me
I
couldn't
leave
him,
not
there.
It's
all
right,
Harry.
It's
all
right.
He's
home.
You
both
are.
Keep
everybody
in
their
seats.
The
body
must
be
moved,
Dumbledore.
Let
me
through.
Let
me
through!
Let
me
through!
That's
my
son!
That's
my
boy!
It's
my
boy!

-Come
on.
Get
up.
Easy,
easy!
This
is
not
where
you
want
to
be
No!
It's
all
right,
I
got
you.
I
got
you.
Come
on.
Easy,
now.
AMOS:
No!
Are
you
all
right,
Potter?
Does
it
hurt?
That?
Not
so
much
now.
Perhaps
I'd
better
take
a
look
at
it.
HARRY:
Someone
had
bewitched
it.
What
was
it
like?
-What
was
he
like?
The
Dark
Lord.
HARRY:
What
was
it
like
I
don't
know.

It
was
like
I'd
fallen
...into
one
of
my
nightmares.

Were
there
others?
In
the
graveyard,
were
there
others?
Um....
I....
I
don't
think
I
said
anything

"Marvelous
Did
you
think
that
oaf
...if
I
hadn't
suggested
it?

Do
you
think
Cedric
Diggory
would've
...if
I
hadn't
told
him
first
myself?
Did
you
think
Neville
Longbottom,
...could've
provided
you
with
gillyweed
...that
led
him
straight
to
it?
Huh?
Eh?
It
was
you
from
the
beginning.
You
bewitched
Krum,
but
you--

You
won
because
I
made
it
so,
Potter.
You
ended
up
in
that
graveyard
tonight
And
now
the
deed
is
done.

The
blood
that
runs
through
these
veins

Imagine
how
he
will
reward
me
...that
I
have
once
and
for
all...
...silenced
the
great
Harry
Potter.
DUMBLEDORE:
Severus.

DUMBLEDORE:
-Do
you
know
who
I
am?
-Are
you
Alastor
Moody?
Are
you?
Is
he
in
this
room?
Is
he
in
this
room?
Harry,
away
from
there!
DUMBLEDORE:
You
all
right,
Alastor?
That's
Moody.
But
then
who's--?

Polyjuice
Potion.
Now
we
know
who's
been
stealing
We'll
get
you
up
in
a
minute.




-Aah!
Barty
Crouch
Junior.
I'll
show
you
mine
Your
arm,
Harry.
CROUCH
JUNIOR:
He's
back.
Lord
Voldemort
has
returned.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
I
couldn't
help
it.
Send
an
owl
to
Azkaban.
I
think
-I'll
be
welcomed
back
like
a
hero.
Personally,
I've
never
had
much
time

Today,
we
acknowledge...
...a
really
terrible
loss.
Cedric
Diggory
was,
as
you
all
know...
...exceptionally
hard-working...
...infinitely
fair-minded...
...and,
most
importantly...
...a
fierce,
fierce
friend.
Now,
I
think,
therefore,
you
have
You
see...
...Cedric
Diggory
was
murdered...
...by
Lord
Voldemort!
The
Ministry
of
Magic
But
not
to
do
so,
I
think,
Now,
the
pain...
...we
all
feel
at
this
dreadful
loss
...and
reminds
us...
...that
while
we
may
come
from
different
...our
hearts
beat
as
one.
In
light
of
recent
events...
...the
bonds
of
friendship
we've
made
Remember
that,
and
Cedric
Diggory
You
remember
that...
...and
we'll
celebrate
a
boy
who
was...
...kind
and
honest...
...and
brave
and
true,
I
never
liked
these
curtains.
Set
them
on
fire
in
my
fourth
year.
By
accident,
of
course.
I
put
you
in
terrible
danger
Professor...
...when
I
was
in
the
graveyard,
...when
Voldemort's
wand
and
mine
Priori
Incantatem.
You
saw
your
parents
that
night,
They
reappeared.
No
spell
can
reawaken
the
dead,
Harry.
Dark
and
difficult
times
lie
ahead.
Soon
we
must
all
face
the
choice
But
remember
this:
You
have
friends
here.
You're
not
alone.

Hermione.
This
is
for
you.
Write
to
me.
Promise.
Bye.
Au
revoir,
Ron.


Do
you
think
we'll
ever
just
have
-No.
No,
I
didn't
think
so.
Oh,
well.
Everything's
going
to
change
now,
Yes.
Promise
you'll
write
this
summer.
I
won't.
You
know
I
won't.
-Harry
will,
won't
you?
