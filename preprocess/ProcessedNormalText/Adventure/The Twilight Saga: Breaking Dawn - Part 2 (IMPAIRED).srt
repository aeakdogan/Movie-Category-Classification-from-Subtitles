So
beautiful.
We're
the
same
temperature
now.

Hey,
Bella,
you're
a
lot
stronger
than
I
am
right
now.

It's
your
turn
not
to
break
me.

I
love
you.
I
love
you.
Renesmee.

She's
incredible.
Where
is
she?
I
have
to
see
her.
Wait.
Wait.
You
need
to
get
your
thirst
under
control.
Yeah,
you'll
need
to
hunt.

Close
your
eyes.
What
do
you
hear?






Bella,
don't!


EDWARD:
Bella,
stop!
I'm
sorry,
I
didn't
realize


I
have
to
get
outta
here.
Okay,
I
can
help
you.

Or
not.


EDWARD:

Well,
I'm
amazed.
You
ran
away
from
human
blood
mid-hunt.
Even
mature
vampires

You're
still
here.
JACOB:
So
are
you.
I
didn't
expect
you
to
seem
so
you.
Except
for
the
creepy
eyes.
I
would
keep
my
distance
for
now.
It's
safer
for
the
baby
Since
when
do
you
care
about
Renesmee?
All
right.
Take
a
whiff.
Well,
I
can
see

Jake,
you
really
do
stink.

You
guys
really
look
great
together.
Want
to
come
meet
our
daughter?
Welcome
to
the
family.
You
look
amazing,
Bella.
Someone's
been
waiting
to
meet
you.
Rose.


Beautiful.
What
was
that?
She
showed
you
Showed
me?
How?
How
do
I
hear
thoughts?
How
does
Alice
see
the
future?
She's
gifted.
I've
only
been
out
for
two
days?
Her
growth
rate
is
unprecedented.
All
right.
That's
enough
Jacob.
She's
doing
great.
Yeah.
Let's
not
push
it
though.
What's
your
problem?
Oh.
Do
tell
her,
Jacob.
This
should
be
good.
Hold
on
a
second.
Bella.
Look,
it's
a
wolf
thing.
What's
a
wolf
thing?
Um...
You
know
we
have
no
control
over
it.
We
can't
choose
who
it
happens
with.
And
it
doesn't
mean
Take
Renesmee
out
of
the
room.
Oh.
Edward,
don't
touch
me
right
now.
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you.
Oh.
You
imprinted
on
my
daughter?
It
wasn't
my
choice!
She's
a
baby!
It's
not
like
that.
You
think
Edward
would
let
me
live
if
it
was?
I'm
still
debating
it.
I've
held
her
once!
One
time,
Jacob!
And
already
you
think
that
wolfy
claim
on
her?
She's
mine!


It's
fine,
Leah.
You're
gonna
stay
away
from
her.
You
know
I
can't
do
that.


Stop
her,
Edward.
He
said
it's
fine.
She's
amazing,
right?
Do
you
remember
how
much
That's
gone
now,
right?
Long
gone.
Because
it
was
her.
From
the
beginning
it
was
Nessie?
You
nicknamed
my
daughter
-


Seth,
are
you
okay?
Seth,
I'm
sorry.

He'll
be
all
right.
Bella,
you
know
me
better
than
anyone.
All
I
want
is
for
Ness...
Renesmee
to
be
safe.
Happy.
Look,
nothing
ever
made
sense
before.
You.
Me.
Any
of
it.
And
now
I
understand
why.
This
was
the
reason.



Finally.
My
turn.
Where
does
she
sleep?
In
my
arms.
Or
Edward's
or
Esme's.
Happy
birthday.
I
stopped
aging
three
days
ago.
Well,
we're
celebrating
anyway.
So
suck
it
up.
BELLA:
I
still
hate
surprises.
ALlCE:
You'll
love
this
one.
Welcome
home!
We
thought
you
guys
What
do
you
think?
I
think
it's
perfect.
Go
inside.
Have
fun.
EDWARD:
This
will
be
Renesmee's
room.
Closet.
BELLA:
Wow.
Alice
stocked
it
for
you.
-
Clearly.
This
is
our
room.
Vampires
don't
sleep.
It's
not
intended
for
sleep.


You
really
were
holding
back
before.
I'm
never
gonna
get
enough
of
this.
We
don't
get
tired.
We
don't
have
to
rest
I
mean,
how
are
we
gonna
stop?

Rosalie
and
Emmett
were
so
bad,
before
we
could
stand
to
be

I
think
we
might
be
worse.
Definitely
worse.

EMMETT:
Wow.
Done
already?
Where's
Renesmee?
Blondie
stole
her.
Break
a
lot
of
stuff?
BELLA:
Emmett.
No.


Is
that
Charlie?
He's
been
calling
twice
a
day.
He's
in
pretty
rough
shape.
CARLlSLE:
Eventually,
we'll
have
to
tell
him
He
needs
to
mourn,
Bella.
Okay.
We'll
do
it
tomorrow.
I'm
gonna
miss
this
place.
We'll
come
back.
We
always
do.
Wait.
Nobody
said
anything
about
leaving.
Once
people
believe
Bella's
dead,
So
you
just
disappear?
Jacob,
we
don't
have
another
choice.
Hey.
You
heard
anything?
Charlie,
Bella
is...
Uh...
No,
she's
not.
No,
no,
no,
I
mean,
she's
fine.
She's
back
home
and
she's
feeling
better.
Why
didn't
you
say
so?
That's
great.
Wait.
There's
something
you
need
to
see
first.
I
need
to
see
Bella.
Look,
in
order
for
Bella
to
get
better,
she
had
to
change.
What
do
you
mean,
"change"?
Here
goes
nothing.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
You
don't
live
in
the
world
you
think
you
do.
Jacob,
put
your
clothes
on.
JACOB:
Now,
this
may
seem
strange.
Really
strange.
But
stranger
things
happen
every
day.
Trust
me.
Holy
shit!


JACOB:
Look,
I
solved
a
problem.
You
were
leaving.
What
did
you
expect
me
to
do?
You
don't
realize
The
Volturi
will
kill
anyone
No,
I
didn't
tell
him
about
you.
Just
me.
I
only
said
you
were
different.
And
that
we
have
a
niece
who
we
adopted.
I
mean,
seriously,
Jake,
Did
you
consider
It'll
be
like
sticking
And
that's
assuming
JACOB:
Look,
Charlie's
been
in
hell.
And
I
know
you'll
be
Jacob,
don't
try
and
pretend
you're
doing
this
Sorry
you
feel
that
way
because
he'll
be
here
in
10
minutes.
What?
ALlCE:
These
will
irritate
your
eyes
at
first.
The
main
thing
is
not
to
move
too
fast.
Try
taking
a
seat.
Crossing
your
legs.
Maybe
a
tad
slower.
Hmm.
And
blink
at
least
three
times
a
minute.
Good.
For
a
cartoon
character.
Hold
your
breath.
It
will
help
with
the
thirst.
Just
don't
forget
to
move
your
shoulders
ROSALlE:
And
don't
sit
so
straight.
Humans
don't
do
that.
Okay.
I
got
it.
Move
around,
blink,
slouch.

Good
luck.
Hello,
Charlie.
Where's
Bella?
Bella.
Hi,
Dad.
Are
you
okay?
Never
better.
Healthy
as
a
horse.
You
don't
turn
into
an
animal,
too,
do
you?
She
wishes
she
was
that
awesome.
Let's
give
them
some
privacy.
Uh,
Jake
said
that
this...
This
was
necessary.
What
does
that
mean?
I
really
think
it
would
be
better...
I
wanna
know
what
happened
to
you.
I
can't
tell
you.
I
think
I
deserve
an
explanation.
You
do.
But
if
you
really
need
one,
I
can't
stay
here.
Oh,
come
on!
No!
No
more
going
away!
Dad,
you're
just
gonna
have
to
trust
I'm
all
right.
I'm
more
than
all
right.
Can
you
live
with
that?
Can
I
live
with
that?
Well,
I
don't
know,
Bella.
I
mean,
I
just
watched
a
kid
turn
into
a
very
large
dog.
My
daughter
looks
like
my
daughter.
But
doesn't.
Can
you
please
just
believe
that
And
I
don't
need
to
know
this?
No.
Really,
you
don't.
Well...
Not
gonna
lose
you
again.
I
can't.
Then
you
won't.
I
promise.
I
missed
you,
Bells.
So
much.
I
missed
you,
Dad.
Charlie.
This
is
Renesmee.
Your
niece?
Our
daughter.
Right.
The
adoption.
Renee-semee?
She's
got
your
eyes,
Bella.
Need
to
know,
I
guess.
JASPER:
Well
done,
Bella.
Never
seen
a
newborn
I'm
not
sure
she
is
a
newborn.
She's
so
tame.
EDWARD:
Emmett,
don't
antagonize
her.
She's
the
strongest
one
in
the
house.
-

Please.
Don't
hurt
yourself,
Emmett.
JASPER:
All
right.
On
3.
1,
2,
-
3!

Did
you
see
that?

Thank
you.
BELLA:
My
time
as
a
human
was
over.
But
I
never
felt
more
alive.
I
was
born
to
be
a
vampire.
Everything
was
falling
into
place.
Even
the
Volturi
Though
they'd
want
proof
eventually.
It
seemed
we
had
only
one
enemy
left.
Time.
Renesmee
was
growing
too
fast.
We
all
worried
about
It
just
made
every
moment
more
precious.
RENESMEE:
Look,
a
snowflake.
It's
beautiful.
Why
don't
you
go
get
another
one?
Edward
thinks
that
There
are
tribes
there
RENESMEE:
Who
was
that?
I
think
that's
our
cousin
from
Denali.

Irina!
Tanya
convinced
lrina
It
looks
like
she
changed
her
mind.
Seeing
Jacob
Wish
I
could
have
just
spoken
to
her.
She's
family.
She'll
come
around.



What
a
pleasant
surprise.
What
do
you
want?
Hmm?
I
have
to
report
a
crime.
The
Cullens...
They've
done
something
terrible.
Allow
me,
my
dear.
Oh,
my.

What
is
it,
Alice?
The
Volturi.
They're
coming
for
us.
Aro,
Caius,
Marcus,
the
Guard.
And
lrina.
Honey,
come
here.
Why?
What
did
lrina
see
in
the
woods?
We
were
just
walking.
Ness
was
catching
snowflakes.
Of
course.
Irina
thinks
Renesmee's
an
lmmortal
Child.
CARLlSLE:
The
lmmortal
Children
So
enchanting.
To
be
near
them
was
to
love
them.
But
their
development
was
frozen
They
couldn't
be
taught
or
restrained.
A
single
tantrum

Humans
heard
about
the
devastation.
Stories
spread.
The
Volturi
were
forced
to
intervene.
Since
the
Children
they
had
to
be
destroyed.

WOMAN:
No!

No!
No!

CARLlSLE:
Their
creators
grew
very
attached

Long-established
covens
were
torn
apart.
Countless
humans
slaughtered.
Traditions,
friends,
even
families.
Lost.
WOMAN:
No,
no!
-
Mother!
Mother!


So
the
Denalis'
mother
CARLlSLE:
Yes.
And
she
paid
the
price.

Well,
Renesmee's
nothing
like
those
children.
She
was
born,
not
bitten.
So
can't
you
just
explain
that
to
the
Volturi?
Aro
has
enough
proof
in
lrina's
thoughts.
So
we
fight.
JASPER:
Their
offensive
No
one
can
stand
against
Jane.
Alec's
even
worse.
Well,
then
we
convince
them.
They're
coming
to
kill
us,
not
to
talk.
No,
you're
right.
They
won't
listen
to
us.
But
maybe
others
can
convince
them.
Carlisle,
you
have
friends
I
won't
ask
them
to
fight.
Not
fight.
Witness.
If
enough
people
knew
the
truth,
maybe
we
could
convince
the
Volturi
to
listen.
We
can
ask
this
of
our
friends.
At
least
we
get
to
go
to
London
again.
We
haven't
been
there
in
a
long
time.
All
right.
Let's
get
this
show
on
the
road.
SAM:
Alice
asked
me
to
give
you
that.
She
and
Jasper
Carlisle?
They've
left
us.
Why?
She
didn't
say.
Can
I
see
that?
ALlCE:
Gather
as
many
witnesses
as
you
can
That's
when
they'll
come.
BELLA:
Alice's
instructions
were
clear,
Why
would
she
and
Jasper
leave
What
did
they
know?
Our
search
for
witnesses
began
TANYA:
Edward,
is
everything
all
right?
Why
didn't
you
tell
us
you
were
coming?
CARMEN:
Is
it
lrina?
Have
you
heard
from
her?
Not
directly.
Why
is
your
bride
waiting
in
the
car?
KATE:
And
why
have
you
brought
I
can
smell
him
from
here.
My
family
is
in
danger.
I
need
your
help.
What's
happened?
It's
hard
to
explain
but
I
need
you
to
be
open-minded.
Of
course.
Okay.
Time
to
meet
some
new
people.
What
if
they
don't
like
me?
-
They'll
love
you.
Once
they
understand
you.
They
just
haven't
met
anyone
like
you
before.
Okay.

The
Volturi
will
come
for
all
of
us.
You
get
that
thing
out
of
here.
She's
not
what
she
looks
like.
This
is
a
crime!


Stay
back!
She
has
blood
in
her
veins.
You
can
feel
her
warmth.
I
can
feel
it.
I'm
her
biological
father.
-
Bella
is
her
mother.
It's
true.
She
was
born
I've
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
She
can
show
you,
if
you
let
her.
Tanya,
you
owe
us
this
much.
We're
all
under
a
death
sentence
BELLA:
Don't
be
afraid.
This
is
how
she
communicates.
It's
true.
She's
not
immortal.
BELLA:
I
knew
the
rest
of
our
family
Fear
of
the
unknown.
Fear
of
the
Volturi.
CARLlSLE:
Amun,
please!
I
cannot
help
you,
Carlisle.
I
wouldn't
ask
if
it
weren't
urgent.
You
must
go.
I'd
like
to
hear
about
it.
I
never
get
to
meet
any
of
Amun's
friends.
He
likes
to
keep
me
hidden.
I
can't
imagine
why.
-
Carlisle.
EDWARD:
Benjamin
can
And
here
I
get
super
self-control.

Who
are
they?
Senna
and
Zafrina.
From
the
Amazon.
BELLA:
The
arrival
of
Senna
and
Zafrina
in
even
the
most
remote
corners
of
the
world
while
others
searched
for

BELLA:
A
patriot
Carlisle
first
met
would
become
our
most
unlikely
ally.

Shut
up!
I
hated
the
first
British
lnvasion.
And
I
hate
the
second
one
even
more.
EMMETT:
Even
the
Beatles?
Really,
Garrett?
Old
habits
die
hard.
-
Carlisle
needs
you.

Sounds
interesting.
MAN:
Help!
But
first
I'd
better
finish
my
meal.
Help
me!
Help!


BELLA:
Each
of
them
was
won
over.
Each
was
made
to
see.
Carlisle
convinced
his
Irish
friends
Although
we
were
grateful
for
their
help,
their
thirst
for
human
blood
The
nomads
Rosalie
and
Emmett
sent
Especially
Peter
who
had
fought
alongside
Lotta
red
eyes
around
here.
They
agreed
not
to
hunt
in
the
area.
But
they'll
feed
somewhere.
BELLA:
As
more
vampires
more
Quileutes
turned.
Their
nature
compelling
them
to
join
the
pack.

Hey,
easy
there.
Hey!
-

You're
gonna
be
okay.

BELLA:
Finally,
Carlisle
and
Esme
-
How
many
came?
You
have
some
good
friends.
And
Alice?
We'll
all
be
on
Aro's
list
now.
Centuries
on
the
run.
Some
friend,
Carlisle.
Alistair,
come
meet
everyone.
I
already
told
you,
if
it
comes
to
a
fight,
It
won't
come
to
a
fight.
I'll
be
in
the
attic.
He's
not
a
people
person.
BELLA:
We
opened
our
home
to
18
vampires.
Many
with
gifts
of
their
own.
Zafrina
had
power
over
the
mind.
She
could
make
anyone
see
If
she
weren't
holding
my
hand
right
now,
I
don't
see
anything.
ELEAZAR:
Edward,
What's
a
shield?
The
ones
I've
met
are
so
different.
It's
a
defensive
talent.
It's
why
I
couldn't
read
your
mind,
It's
why
Aro
couldn't.
You
have
a
very
powerful
gift.

Oh,
yeah,
she's
a
shield,
all
right.
Shoulda
put
her
on
her
ass.
Or
your
voltage
has
been
exaggerated.
Maybe
it
only
works
on
the
weak.
Garrett,
I
wouldn't.
-

You
are
an
amazing
woman.
JACOB:
Now,
you
guys
Which
is
why
you'll
need
If
your
mom
pisses
you
off,
Whoever's
coming
wasn't
invited.



Whoopa!


CARLlSLE:
Vladimir,
Stefan,
you're
a
long
way
from
home.
What
are
they
doing
here?
We
heard
the
Volturi
But
that
you
would
not
stand
alone.
We
didn't
do
what
we
were
accused
of.
We
do
not
care
what
you
did,
Carlisle.
We
have
been
waiting
a
millennium
for
the
ltalian
scum
to
be
challenged.
It's
not
our
plan
to
fight
the
Volturi.
Shame.
Aro's
witnesses
will
be
so
disappointed.
They
enjoy
a
good
fight.

Aro's
witnesses?
VLADlMlR:
Aww.
Still
hoping
they'll
listen?
ELEAZAR:
When
Aro
it's
never
long
before
evidence
turns
up
So
he's
done
this
before?
It
happens
so
rarely,
Apparently
he
always
pardons
one
person
This
person
always
has
an
ability.
And
they're
always
given
This
is
all
about
Alice.
-
He
has
no
one
like
her.
Why
does
he
need
witnesses?
To
spread
the
word
After
he
slaughters
an
entire
coven.
AMUN:
Benjamin,
Tia,
-
we're
leaving.
What
makes
you
think
What's
to
stop
them
Or
Zafrina
or
Kate
or
anyone
else
with
a
gift?
Their
goal
isn't
punishment,
it's
power.
It's
acquisition.
Carlisle
might
not
ask
you
to
fight,
but
I
will.
For
the
sake
of
my
family.
But
also
for
yours.
And
for
the
way
you
want
to
live.
The
packs
will
fight.
We've
never
been
afraid
of
vampires.
We
will
fight.
GARRETT:
This
won't
be
the
first
time
We'll
join
you.
No.
I
will
do
the
right
thing,
Amun.
You
may
do
as
you
please.
We
will
stand
with
you.
So
will
we.
That
didn't
take
much.
Let's
hope
it
doesn't
come
to
that.
We'll
see.
BELLA:
Everyone
showed
courage.
Though
we
knew
that
Aro's
army
Soon
we
would
face
the
dark
gifts
of
Jane.
And
worse,
the
paralyzing
vapor
who
could
rob
you
of
sight,
sound
and
touch.



I
refused
him!
I'm
not
with
Carlisle!
Alec?
I
will
never
go
against
you.
Of
course
not,
my
dear
Toshiro.
It
seems
Carlisle
is
still
expecting
you.

Carlisle
is
all
but
ensuring

Sad,
isn't
it?
EDWARD:
Aro
will
want
us
incapacitated
Jane
and
Alec
will
try
and
take
me
out
first
Too
bad
we
don't
all
have
your
shield.
Doesn't
help
me
fight,
though.
TANYA:
No,
but
you
could
help
the
rest
of
us,
ifyou
could
project
it.
What
do
you
mean?
I
mean
shield
someone
other
than
yourself.
Is
that
possible?
Gifts
can
be
developed.
Over
time.
At
first,
mine
was
just
in
my
palms.
Now
I
can
radiate
it
all
over
my
body.
-
How
do
you
do
it?
-
Tell
me.
You
need
to
visualize
it.
See
how
it
moves.
What
color
it
is.
Now
picture
it
expanding.
Will
it
to
go
beyond
you.

I
think
she
needs
something
to
motivate
her.
-
No.
He
says
that
now.
Focus,
Bella,
or
he's
gonna
be
hurting.
-
Edward,
I'm
not
ready
to
do
this
yet.

I'm
sorry.
I
said
that
I
wasn't
ready.
Dude,
you're
not
motivating
her.
You
want
to
try?
-

Kate!
KATE:
You
seem
to
lack
incentive.
Shall
I
go
see
if
Renesmee's
awake?
Are
you
crazy?
All
right.
This
one's
on
full
power.


It's
painful,
but
it's
bearable.
Okay,
we
should
go
again.
Emmett.
I'm
good.
BELLA:
"There's
sweet
music
here
that
"softer
falls
"Or
night
dews
on
still
waters
between
walls
"of
shadowy
granite
in
a
gleaming
pass.
"Music
that
brings
Mom.
Hmm?
Did
Aunt
Alice
and
Uncle
Jasper
run
away
because
we're
gonna
die?
No.
I
think
they
left
to
keep
us
safer.
That's
what
all
these
I'll
never
let
anybody
hurt
you.
Come
here.
Go
to
sleep.
It's
strange.
Physically,
I
feel
like
I
could
demolish
a
tank.
Mentally,
I
just
feel
drained.
How
about
a
bath?
I
do
remember
how
to
undress
myself.
Yeah,
I
just
do
it
so
much
better.
Bella,
I've
had
a
bad
habit
of
underestimating
you.
Every
obstacle
you've
faced,
I'd
think
you
couldn't
overcome
it.
And
you
just
did.
You're
the
reason
My
family.
I'm
gonna
get
the
water
running.
BELLA:
Alice
made
sure
Because
only
my
mind
JACOB:
I'm
surprised
If
I
don't
take
Renesmee
to
my
dad,
27
vampires,
one
human.
Not
so
great.
I
know
that's
what
you
told
Edward.
-

I'm
just
glad
to
get
away
from

I'm
sorry.
I
know.
They're
the
good
guys.
But
come
on,
Dracula
One
and
Two
are
-
creepy.
CHARLlE:
There
she
is.
Come
here.
Oh!
Wow!
Look
at
you.
You've
grown
half
a
foot!
Seriously.
Like
6
inches.
Come
on
inside.
Lunch
is
on
the
table.
We
got
a
tree
to
decorate,
huh?
I've
actually
got
a
few
errands
to
run,
guys.
I'll
be
back
soon,
okay?
-
CHARLlE:
Come
on.
Let's
go.

BELLA:
Alice's
note
Maybe
she
had
a
plan
for
us
after
all.
And
maybe
J.
Jenks
was
the
key.
