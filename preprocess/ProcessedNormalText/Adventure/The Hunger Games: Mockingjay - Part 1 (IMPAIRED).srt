KATNISS:

Start
simple.
Start
with
what
you
know
is
true.
My
name
is
Katniss
Everdeen.
I
was
in
the
Hunger
Games.

Peeta...
Peeta
was
left
behind.
-

WOMAN:
Miss
Everdeen?
You
can't
be
in
here.
I
had
a
nightmare.
WOMAN:
You
need
to
sleep.
Just
five
more
minutes.

No.

No,
please,
don't.
Don't
touch
me!
Don't!


Finnick.
I
wanted
to
go
back
but
I,
uh...
I
couldn't
move.
They
have
Annie,
too.
She's,
uh...

She's
in
the
Capitol.
I
wish
she
was
dead.
I
wish
they
were
all
Miss
Everdeen.
Colonel
Boggs,
I
know
you've
been
discharged,
but
President
Coin's
Is
there
any
news?
BOGGS:
I'm
just
here
to
escort
you.
We
were
always
told
BOGGS:
Capitol
bombed
But
we're
military,
Preparing,
training.
The
war
never
stopped
for
us.
PLUTARCH:
There
she
is.
Our
Girl
on
Fire.
Madam
President,
What
an
honor
it
is
to
meet
you.
You're
a
courageous
young
woman.
I
know
how
disorienting
this
must
be.
And
I
can't
imagine
Katniss,
President
Alma
Coin.
Please
know
how
welcome
you
are.
I
hope
you'll
find
We've
known
loss
in
13,
too.
PLUTARCH:
This
is
history.
PRESIDENT
COIN:
I
apologize.
I
wish
you
had
more
time
to
recover,
Please,
have
a
seat.
Are
you
aware
of
what's
happened?
When
you
fired
your
you
electrified
the
nation.
There
have
been
riots
and
uprisings
We
believe
that
if
we
keep
But
if
we
don't,
if
we
let
it
dissipate,
we
could
be
waiting
Everyone
in
13
is
ready
for
this.
What
about
Peeta?
I
don't
know.
But
there's
no
way
for
me
to
contact
BEETEE:
The
Capitol
has
always
suppressed
But
I
know
their
system
very
well.
I
managed
to
break
through.
All
we
need
now
is
PLUTARCH:
Katniss,
We
need
to
show
them
and
willing
to
stand
up
'Cause
we
need
every
district
The
way
you
did.
So
we're
gonna
propos,
I
like
to
call
them,
on
The
Mockingjay.
Spreads
the
word
that
we're
gonna
The
fire
that
The
Mockingjay
started.

You
left
him
there.
-
You
left
Peeta
in
that
arena
to
die.
Peeta
was
the
one
Miss
Everdeen.
This
revolution
is
about
everyone.
It's
about
all
of
us.
And
we
need
a
voice.
Then
you
should've
saved
Peeta.
Maybe
you
should
have
Oh,
no.
No,
listen
to
me.
This
is
not
the
girl
you
described.
Obviously,
we
need
to
make
it
personal.
Remind
her
who
the
real
enemy
is.
She
knows
who
the
enemy
is.
Unless
she's
forgotten.
There's
explaining
and
there's
showing.
Let
her
see
what
She
can't
handle
it.
This
is
the
only
choice
you
have.
People
don't
always
show
up
But
that
anger,
that
anger-driven
We
need
to
unite
that
have
been
doing
nothing
in
an
arena
for
years.
We
have
to
have
a
lightning
rod.
They'll
follow
her.
Let
her
see
it.
Send
her.

GALE:
I
can't
believe
You
can
say
"no."
I
need
to
see
it
for
myself.
This
way.
GALE:
13
swept
everything,
so
you'd
be
safe.
You
sure
you
don't
KATNISS:
Yeah.
I'm
sure.
We'll
have
our
eyes
on
you
from
above.



-

Figures.

-
Hey!
-
Come
on.
Don't
you
wanna
see
Prim?
There
you
go.

Shh.
Egeria!
We
need
to
fix
these
lines.
I
won't
say
"rebels."
These
are
senseless
acts
of
defiance.
And
I
won't
legitimize
them.
We'll
call
them
"criminals."
Mmm.
"Radicals."
Hmm.
Otherwise
we're
breaking
my
oldest
rule.
Never
let
them
see
you
bleed.
Citizens,
tonight
I
address
all
of
Panem
as
one.
Since
the
Dark
Days,
Panem
has
had
It
is
a
peace
built
upon
cooperation.
And
a
respect
for
law
and
order.
In
the
past
weeks,
following
the
actions
Those
who
choose
this
destructive
path,
your
actions
are
based
of
how
we
have
survived.
It
is
a
contract.
Each
district
supplies
the
Capitol.
In
return,
-

is
to
put
the
entire
system
in
danger.
The
Capitol
is
the
beating
heart
of
Panem.
Nothing
can
survive
without
a
heart.
The
criminals
that
kneel
before
you
Which
is
why
all
images
of
The
Mockingjay
Possessing
them
will
be
Punishable
by
death.
Justice
shall
be
served
swiftly.
Order
shall
be
restored.
To
those
who
ignore
-

...prepare
to
pay
the
ultimate
price.

It's
okay.
We're
okay.
We're
all
here
now.

KATNISS:
I
smuggled
him
in.
I
got
Dad.
And
I
got
some
They
have
strict
rules.
I
don't
know

You
should
try
to
eat
something.

Hello.
Good
evening.
And
a
big
welcome
I'm
Caesar
Flickerman.
And
whoever
you
are,
if
you're
working,
If
you're
having
dinner,
Because
you
are
going
to
want
There
has
been
about
what
really
happened
And
here
to
shed
Please
welcome
Mr.
Peeta
Mellark.
Peeta,
a
lot
of
people
PEETA:
Yeah,
I
know
how
they
feel.
CAESAR:

Talk
us
through
what
really
happened
Well,
first
off,
you
have
to
understand
you
only
get
one
wish.

You're
alive.
CAESAR:
It
costs
your
life.
I
think
it
costs
more
than
your
life.
How
do
you
mean?
I
mean
to
murder
innocent
people,
CAESAR:
Yes.
So
you
hold
on
And
that
night
my
wish
CAESAR:
Yes.
PEETA:
I
should've
just
run
off
with
her
But
you
didn't.
Why?
No,
I
was
caught
up
And
then
they
separated
us
and
that's
when
I
lost
her.
And
then
the
lightning
hit
and
the
whole
force
field
Yes,
but,
Peeta,
Katniss
is
the
one
PEETA:
No.
You
saw
the
footage.
No,
she
didn't
know
Neither
of
us
knew
there
was
a
bigger
plan
-
CAESAR:
You
had
no
idea?
All
right.
Well,
Peeta,
-
to
say
the
least.
It
seems
as
though
Do
you
think
it
was
part
of
her
plan
Or
part
of
the
plan
No,
we
were
not
part
of
any
rebel
plan.
All
right.
I
believe
you,
Yeah.
And
I
was
going
but
I
think
you
might
be
too
upset.
No,
I
can.
-
CAESAR:
Are
you
sure?
CAESAR:
Thank
you.

I
want
everyone
and
to
think
about
We
almost
went
extinct
once
before.
And
now
our
numbers
MAN
1:
He's
one
of
them.
Is
this
really
what
WOMAN
1:
He's
a
traitor.
PEETA:
Kill
ourselves
off?
Killing
is
not
the
answer.
WOMAN
2:
I
can't
believe
he's
doing
this.
Everyone
needs
to
-
MAN
2:
Traitor!
WOMAN
3:
He's
not
one
of
us!
MAN
3:
This
is
treason!
Are
you
calling
for
a
ceasefire?
Yeah.
I
am.
MAN
4:
You're
a
puppet!
WOMAN
4:
Hang
him!
PEETA:
I
want
everyone
to
stop
This
is
not
the
path
to
change.
MAN
5:
Traitor!
It's
not
the
path
to
justice.


There
can't
be
a
ceasefire.
Not
after
everything
Snow's
done.
He
could
have
done
Most
districts,
They
need
the
courage.
Why
do
you
think
he
said
that?

I
don't
know.
He
didn't
look
that
bad.
Maybe
he
made
He's
still
playing
the
game.

No!
No!
No!

I'm
sorry.
It's
just
a
nightmare.
That's
okay.
Peeta,
will
you
stay
with
me?
Yeah.
Always.
PRIM:

Hey.
Can't
sleep?
Tell
me
what's
happening.
I'm
good
at
keeping
secrets.
Even
from
Mom.
No
one
hates
the
And
I
wanna
help.
even
if
we
win
this
war,
I
know
he's
not
safe
there,
I
don't
think
you
know
If
you
want
something,
You
could
demand
almost
anything.
They'd
have
to
agree
to
it.
I
should
wake
you
up
Get
some
sleep
now.
You,
too.
KATNISS:
Thank
you
for
I've
decided
I'll
be
your
Mockingjay.
But
I
have
some
conditions.
Peeta
and
the
other
Tributes,
will
be
rescued
at
the
If
and
when
Peeta
is
liberated,
he
will
receive
a
full
No
punishment
will
be
inflicted.
And
the
same
goes
for
No.
It's
not
their
fault
They're
doing
and
saying
Individuals
don't
make
demands
in
13.
There
will
be
a
tribunal.
Thank
you.
The
Victors
will
be
granted
immunity.
And
you
will
announce
that
You
will
hold
yourself
or
you
will
find
another
Mockingjay.
That's
it.
That's
her.
Isn't
that
who
I
promised
you?
She
wears
the
costume.
Gunfire
in
the
background.
Our
Mockingjay.
Madam
President,
we're
losing
ground,
This
is
worth
the
risk.
She's
worth
the
risk.
Pardons,
tribunals.
It
can
all
be
the
bedrock
in
wartime
I
think
even
Do
you
have
any
other
conditions?
My
sister
gets
to
keep
her
cat.
EFFIE:
Go
away.

Is
it
visiting
hours
again?
Miss
Trinket,
you
see
this
door.
It
opens.
I've
told
you,
these
are
the
standard
You're
not
a
prisoner.
Not
looking
like
this.
We
have
a
bigger
issue
Katniss
has
agreed

That
poor
thing.
And
your
Girl
on
I
need
you
to
I
need
someone
she
trusts.
What
about
Haymitch?
He's
drying
out
in
Aiding
rebels
is
Miss
Trinket,
your
days
no
matter
what
happens
here.
If
you
wanna
play
Stay
here
and
rot.
I'll
find
someone
else
Who?

Anyone
can
be
replaced.
Not
your
Mockingjay.
There
isn't
a
soul
in
this
dungeon
You
honestly
believe
is
going
to
take
my
place?
No.
Good
afternoon.
Thank
you
for
interrupting
your
schedules.
They
have
already
I
hardly
ever
see
children
around
here.
Please,
check
in
with
your
unit
supervisors
A
lot
of
them
were
I
have
an
announcement
Coin
lost
her
family,
too.
Daughter
and
a
husband.
And
our
welcome
guests
from
12.
Katniss
Everdeen
has
consented
to
help
unite
the
districts
In
exchange,
I
have
promised
First,
we'll
assess
all
opportunities
held
hostage
in
the
Capitol.
Peeta
Mellark...

Johanna
Mason...
Finnick,
I
made
the
deal
for
Annie,
too.
...and
Annie
Cresta.
Once
freed,
they
will
be
granted
full
pardon
committed
against
the
rebel
cause.

Good.
That's
good,
Katniss.
If
Katniss
Everdeen
fails
the
deal
will
be
off.
Thank
you
for
your
attention.
Please,
resume
your
daily
schedules.
PLUTARCH:
Madam
President.
Effie
Trinket.
Welcome
to
13.
PLUTARCH:
Madam
President,
-
concise.
You
believe
that
May
I
speak
freely?
You
don't
appear
to
I'm
only
talking
about
salesmanship.
The
thing
with
revolutions,
They
need
to
be
nurtured
and
warmth.
Bit
of
oxygen.
Oxygen.
One
sure
way
to
put
Or
to
use
up
all
Excuse
me.
You
know
what
could
use
KATNISS:
Effie?
Oh!
What
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
a
political
refugee.
Plutarch
rescued
you?
Rescued,
yes,
that's
what
he
calls
it.
You
and
I
were
both
in
the
dark.
Now
I'm
condemned
It
is
wonderful
to
see
you
again.
Can
you
believe
this
place?
I
miss
coffee.
I
never
knew
anyplace
I
mean,
I
thought
at
least
side
action.
I
miss
my
wigs.
Luckily,
I
remembered
when
I
was
coming
up.
You
know,
everything
old
Like
democracy.
Which
brings
me
to
this.

KATNISS:
Cinna.
He's
dead,
isn't
he?
Yes,
dear.
He
made
Plutarch
promise
until
you'd
decided
He
knew
the
risks.
He
believed
in
this
revolution.
He
believed
in
you.
They're
beautiful.
They
have
it.
They
have
the
Mockingjay
outfit.
There's
not
much
of
but
we
will
make
you
the
best-dressed
rebel
in
history.
Okay.
Bring
up
the
lights.


Cinna's
final
touch.
Everyone's
either
gonna
or
be
you.
PLUTARCH:

Perfect.
Absolutely
perfect.
Okay.
Huh.
Little
Wind.
Okay,
Katniss,
-
Okay.
you're
gonna
hold
And
remember
you've
just
stormed
arm-in-arm
with
your
brothers
and
sisters.
Okay.
Whenever
you're
ready.

People
of
Panem,
we
fight,
we
dare,
we...
Does
she
know
the
line?
-
I
know
it.
I
got
it.
I'm
sorry.
-
Let's
do
it
again.
All
right.
With
energy.
Go.
People
of
Panem,
we
fight!
We
dare
to
end
this
You've
just
been
in
battle!
I'm
sorry.
You've
just
been
in
battle.
Let's
try
it
again.
Whenever
you're
ready.
People
of
Panem,
we
fight!
We
dare
to
end
this


And
that,
my
friends,
Hello,
Katniss.
This
how
you
greet
an
old
friend?
Maybe
I
don't
recognize
you
sober.
I
guess
it
looks
as
bad
as
it
feels.

People
of
Panem,
we
fight!
We
dare!



Uh,
Madam
President,
indulge
me
for
a
moment,
if
you
would.
Let's
everybody
where
Katniss
Everdeen
Not
where
you
were
or
her
dress
went
up
in
flames
or
she
made
a
halfway
And
not
where
Peeta
No,
I'd
like
you
all
to
-
where
she
made
you
feel
something
real.
When
she
volunteered
HAYMITCH:
Excellent
example.
Okay.
I
hope
that
wasn't
important.
Uh...
Okay.
"Volunteer
for
sister."
Good.
Oh.
HAYMITCH:
Oh,
yeah.
You
know,
I
like
you
better,
Effie,
Well,
I
like
you
better
sober.
BEETEE:
When
she
chose
Rue
EFFIE:
Mmm,
yes.
HAYMITCH:
Now,
what
do
No
one
told
her
what
to
do.
BEETEE:
Unscripted,
yes.
So
maybe
we
should
And
wash
her
face.
She's
still
a
girl.

PLUTARCH:
The
opportunities
lacking
below
ground.
So
what
you're
suggesting
PRESIDENT
COIN:
I
can't
sanction
in
battle
just
for
effect.
This
is
not
the
Capitol.
That
is
exactly
what
I'm
suggesting.
PRESIDENT
COIN:
No,
we
can't
protect
her.
HAYMITCH:
It
has
to
come
from
her.
That's
what
people
respond
to.
You
want
a
symbol
for
the
revolution?
She
cannot
be
coached
into
it.
PLUTARCH:
Maybe
District
8.
There
are
no
military
targets
left.
PRESIDENT
COIN:
You'll
never
be
able
I
wanna
go.
And
if
you're
killed?
Make
sure
you

BEETEE:
I've
made
you
some
surprises.
Maybe
you
wanna
try
one
out.
If
you're
gonna
be
you
may
as
well
look
the
part.
And
this
one
is
for
you.
Plutarch
wanted
you
to
have
a
weapon
for
the
sake
of
the
propos
but
I
couldn't
It's
beautiful.
And
look
here.
Regular.
Incendiary.
All
color-coded.
And
tell
Finnick
I've
got
a
trident
for
him
when
he's
ready.
Might
just
cheer
him...
Uh...
Let's
not
fire
You
had
all
of
this
and
you
just
BOGGS:
It's
not
that
simple,
Katniss.
We
weren't
in
any
kind
of
shape
Yeah,
but
they
would've
retaliated
Then
what?
There
would've
Sounds
like
exactly
what
Peeta
said
This
way,
soldier.
EFFIE:
You
are
camera-ready.
Doesn't
your
comrade
look
handsome?
Let's
go.
Come
back
safe.
Quick
introductions,
Katniss.
These
people
have
come
a
long
way
This
is
Cressida.
In
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
Until
I
up
and
left.
Hey-
PLUTARCH:
Let's
see
what
you
can
do.
All
right.
This
is
my
assistant,
Messalla.
It's
an
honor
to
meet
you.
And
your
cameramen
over
there,
Castor.
Hello.
CRESSIDA:
And
Pollux.
Let's
get
locked
in.
You're
all
from
the
Capitol?
Plutarch
got
you
out?
CRESSIDA:
Don't
expect
He's
an
Avox.
And,
no,
it
wasn't
any
sort
of
rescue,
We
all
fled
on
our
own.
For
this.
For
you.
BOGGS:
This
has
gotta
be
fast.
Move
out.
You're

Katniss,
Commander
Paylor,
District
8.
Katniss
has

seein'
some
of
your

Well,

plenty
of
those.
We

Any
hope
you
can
give

The
Capitol's

Aren't
you
worried
PAYLOR:
I
think
it's
better
GALE:
That's
not
what
I
meant.
PAYLOR:
Well,
that's
my
only
other
option.
You
can
come
up
It's
right
through
here.

Don't
film
me
in
there.
Just
let
them
see
your
face.
Huh?
MAN:
Excuse
me.
WOMAN
1:
Yeah.
You
all
right?
WOMAN
2:
It's
okay.
WOMAN
3:
I've
got
you.


WOMAN
1:
Katniss
Everdeen?
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
came
to
see
you.
WOMAN
2:
What
about
the
baby?
I
lost
it.
MAN:
Are
you
fighting,
Katniss?
You
here
to
fight
with
us?
I
am.
I
will.
Tighter.
Tighter,
tighter.
Sir,

cameras
but
we
confirmed
it's
her.
Zoom

ANTONIUS:
She
was
visiting
We're
not
sure
Hmm.
We
can
scramble
hovercraft
We
may
be
able
to
target
her.
Hmm.
Kill
the
wounded.
Sir...
You
wrote
that
speech
yourself,
Egeria.
Any
association
with
the
Mockingjay
symbol
Everyone

that
hospital
Show

what
it
costs
GALE:
Your
mom's
gonna
be
proud
of
you
Will
this
play
in
the
districts?
It'll
be
tattooed
on
their
eyes.

BOGGS:
There's
a
problem.
GALE:
What
kinda
problem?
Incoming
bombers
from
the
north.
We
need
to
find
cover
now.
PAYLOR:
There's
a
bunker
in
there.

Straight
ahead
and
down
the
stairs.

GALE:
Katniss!
Katniss!
BOGGS:
Everdeen!
Gale,
back
away
from
the
wall!


BOGGS:

You
okay?

Move!
They're
going
after
That's
towards
the
hospital.
They're
circling
back
around.



KATNISS:
That's
the
hospital.
They're
targeting
the
hospital.

KATNISS:
Help
them!
Help
them!
CRESSIDA:
Katniss?
Katniss,
can
you
tell
everyone
Katniss,
what
do
you
wanna
say?
I
want
the
rebels
to
know
that
I'm
alive.
That
I'm
in
District
8
where
the
Capitol
just
bombed
a
hospital
filled
with
unarmed
men,
And
there
will
be
no
survivors.
If
you
think
for
one
second
you
are
lying
to
yourselves.
Because
we
know
who
they
are
This
is
what
they
do!
I
have
a
message
for
President
Snow.
You
can
torture
us
and
bomb
us
But
do
you
see
that?
Fire
is
catching.
And
if
we
burn,
you
burn
with
us!
KATNISS:

This
is
what
they
do!
And
we
must
fight
back.
You
can
torture
us
and
bomb
us
and
burn
our
districts
to
the
ground.
Plutarch's
faith
in
you
wasn't
misplaced.
But
do
you
see
that?
Thank
you.
Fire
is
catching.
Come
up
with
me
for
the
beginning.
And
if
we
burn,

There
is
no
progress
without
compromise.
No
victory
without
sacrifice.
But
I
stand
here
with
The
Mockingjay
to
announce
that
our
moment
has
arrived.

Beetee
has
increased
We
will
broadcast
this
message
to
all
the
districts
tonight.
The
Mockingjay's
words
inspiring
everyone
to
join
the
rebellion.
Together,
we
will
become

MAN:
If
we
burn,
you
burn
with
us!
-
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!

-
I
got
good
news.
Coin
agreed
to
let
He's
not
even
afraid
of
us.
It's
'cause
they've
never
It's
almost
not
fair.


GALE:
They
want
us
back.

They
asked
us
to
All
right.
CAESAR:

She
was
arguably
And
I
think
that's
what
is
that
this
girl
was
And
I
think
for
you,
Peeta,
it
must
be
particularly
painful.
I
wish
I
could
give
He's
changed
so
much
already.
CAESAR:
A
sweet
gesture
such
violence.
You
must
love
her
very
much
KATNISS:
He's
shaking.
I
don't
think
that
I
could.
Unless,
of
course,
Peeta,
forced
into
saying
things
that
she
doesn't
even
understand.
Yeah.
That's
exactly
what
I
think.
Even
his
voice
is
different.
PEETA:
I
think
they're
using
her
I
doubt
she
even
And
what's
really
at
stake.
Now,
Peeta,
I
doubt
that
the
rebels
But
if
they
do,
what
would
you
say
to
her?
To
Katniss
Everdeen,
I
would
tell
her
CAESAR:
Yes.
Don't
be
a
fool,
Katniss.
I
know
you
never
The
things
that
you
did
in
The
rebels
have
made
you
Something
that
could
destroy
all
of
us.
So
if
you
have
any
power
or
any
say
in
what
they
do
or
how
they
use
you,
please,
please,
before
it's
too
late.
And
ask
yourself,
can
you
trust
the
people
Do
you
know
what
they
really
want?
We
need
to
respond.
CAESAR:
Thank
you,
revelations
about
the
real
Mockingjay.
Did
you
see
what
he
looks
like?
I
saw
a
coward.
You
don't
have
any
idea
I
don't
care.
Not
if
they
tortured
me.
That
is
the
same
Peeta
No,
it's
not.

Coin's
called
a
meeting.
When
did
"we"
Everyone
has
a
choice.
How
can
he
sit
there
who
destroyed
his
home
He
doesn't
know.
How
could
he?
Nobody's
seen
what
I
have
to
show
them.
So
I
wanna
start
with
you
Bang.
First
shot.
Katniss,
tell
us
what
happened
here.
GALE:
We
were
all
standin'
right
here
watchin'
the
Games
The
screens
just
went
dark.
Nobody
had
any
idea
what
happened.
Peacekeepers
forced
us
For
maybe
an
hour,
Little
past
9:00,
All
of
them.
And
I
knew
what
that
meant.
Me
and
a
couple
of
guys
from
the
mines,
we
started
pulling
people
and
tried
to
get
'em
to
the
fence
line
but
a
lotta
people
were
So
they
headed
up
onto
the
road.
Make
a
break
for
it
that
way.

Stay
with
Gale.
GALE:
915
of
us
Then
we
watched
They
firebombed
them
as
they
ran
away.
915
outta
10,000.
I
should've
grabbed
people.
Some
of
the
kids
I
could've
carried.
CRESSIDA:
You
saved
Without
you,
Not
even
the
memory
of
it.

This
is
where
you
kissed
me.
I
didn't
think
you
remembered
that.
I'd
have
to
be
dead
to
forget
that.
Maybe
not
even
then.
I
knew
you'd
do
that.
How?
I
didn't.
'Cause
I'm
in
pain.
That's
the
only
way
Don't
worry,
Katniss.
It'll
pass.

Hey-
Yeah,
that's
a
mockingjay.


Well,
now
they'll
never
shut
up.
You
want
me
to
sing?
Are
you,
are

Wow.

Little

Yes.
But
not
the

I
designed
this
But
I
can't
find

through
it.
Guess
I
did
my
job
too
well.
At

Katniss,
you're

PEETA:

Tonight,

of
granaries
on
fire,
and
of
a
savage
attack

Oh,
what
have
they
done
to
you?
I'm
begging
for
restraint
and
decency.
We
interrupt

bring
you...

Comin'

That's

Beetee's

Katniss,

there?
Peeta.
Katniss?
CAESAR:
Peeta,
please
continue.
You
were
telling
us
about
these
savage
attacks.
PEETA:
Yeah.
The
attack
on
the
dam
was
a
callous
and
inhuman
act
of
destruction...
Where
a
dead
man
called
out
Think
about
it.
How
will
this
end?
No
one
can
survive
this.
No
one
is
safe
now.
Not

Not

Prim,
talk
about
something.
They
promoted
me
at
the
hospital.
I
forgot
to
tell
you.
They're
training
me
to
be
a
doctor.
They'd
be
stupid
not
to.





Hey-
Can
I
sit?
Yeah.
KATNISS:
Snow's
using
Annie
to
punish
you.
He's
taunting
us
with
them.
I
didn't
understand
until
just
now

After
your
first
Games,
I
thought
the
whole
We
all
expected
you
But
it
wasn't
until
Peeta's
heart
stopped
I
knew
I'd
misjudged
you.
You
love
him.
I'm
not
saying
in
what
way.
Maybe
you
don't
even
know
yourself.
But
anyone
paying
attention
can
see
it.
How
do
you
live
with
it?
I
drag
myself
outta
nightmares
But
it's
better
not
to
give
in
to
it.
Takes
10
times
longer
than
it
does
to
fall
apart.

BOGGS:

Katniss?
Katniss?
Come
with
me.
We
took
their
best
shot.
Yeah.
Your
mother
and
sister
okay?
Yeah,
they're
fine.
I
need
you
to
do
something
for
us.
I
need
you
to
tell
Panem
with
no
casualties.
And
we
remain
fully
operational.
Okay.
You
should
know
something.
We
had
eight
extra
minutes
because
of
Peeta's
warning.
I
won't
forget
that.
Thank
you.


EFFIE:
So
Katniss,
it's
"13
is
alive
and
well
and
so
am
l."
Katniss?
Katniss.

Never
one
to
waste
it
GALE:
Why
would
they
drop
these?
For
me.
CRESSIDA:
Ready
to
go,
Katniss?
We're
gonna
do
this,
Tell
me
about
the
roses.
Tell
Snow
13
is
alive
and
well.
He's
gonna
kill
Peeta.
CRESSIDA:
Let's
try
again.
We
don't
have
a
mic
on
you.
"13
is
alive
and
well
and
so
am
l."
He's
gonna
kill
Peeta.
I
can't.
CRESSIDA:
Katniss?
You
can
do
it,
Katniss.
I
can't
do
this.
CRESSIDA:
"13
is
alive
He's
just
gonna
keep...
He's
never
gonna
stop.
Cressida,
we
should
cut
the
cameras.
-
...as
long
as
I'm
The
Mockingjay.
No.
He
warned
me.
He's
doing
this
because
He's
punishing
Peeta
to
punish
me.
No.
No,
I
can't
do
this.
Katniss.
Don't
make
me
do
this!
Let
her
go.





So
this
is
the
end,
huh?
I
s'pose
you're
I
can't
be
The
Mockingjay.
Not
The
Mockingjay.
You
know,
you're
the
only

I
don't
suppose
they
gave
you
You're
unbelievable.
Okay,
but
I
meant
what
I
said.

Look,
the
reason
I'm
here
they're
rescuing
Peeta.
What?
The
dam
went
down
in
District
5,
Knocked
out
their
signal
defense.
Beetee's
inside
their
system
now,
A
window
is
open
to
us.
How
much
longer?
I
guess
until
the
Capitol
And
President
Coin?
You
know,
I
can
never
in
light
of
the
prohibition
but
Plutarch
got
word
that
Peeta
and
the
others
And
with
the
power
out,
She
knows
that
Peeta
is
the
Capitol's
weapon.
And
as
opposed
to
having
you
two
she's
going
to
get
him.
I
have
to
go
help.

Hey,
hey,
whoa,
kiddo.
Come
on.
What,
are
you
just
and
go
storm
the
Capitol?
Besides,
it's
already
underway.
Six
soldiers
went

I

Just
wanted

done
that?
PRESIDENT

Miss
Everdeen,
it's
the
things
we
love
most
that
destroy
us.
I
want
you
to
remember
Don't
you

I
know
Cut
them
off.

What
happened?
What
happened?
Boggs,
come
in.
He
knows
that
-
It's
a
trap.
We
have
to
get
We
have
to
tell
them
to
get
out.
There's
no
signal.
No.
Haymitch,

knew

No,
Haymitch.
No,
we
don't
know
that.

Did

Did
I

No!
No!
There's
no

I'm
sorry.
It's
the
worst
torture
in
the
world.
Waiting,
when
you
know

Especially
for
people
like
us.
But
whatever
strength,
courage,
madness,
keeps
us
going,
you
find
it,
You
have
it,
soldier.
It's
what's
kept
And
it
won't
fail
you
now.


They're
back.

Johanna.
ANNIE:
Finnick!
Finnick!
Annie?

You're
safe.
Gale!
Are
you
okay?
What?
I
don't

Every

He's

You

Thank

Thank
you.

HAYMITCH:
Peeta!
Peeta!
Get
off!
Let
go!



No,
Katniss.
No,
no,
no.
Calm
down.


Tell
her
she's
awake.
-
Don't
try
to
talk.
Peeta's
okay.
I
just
had
to
get
him
off
you.

It's
called
hijacking.
We
don't
know
how
long
It's
fear
conditioning.
Enhanced
with
tracker
jacker
venom.
You
were
stung
your
first
Games.
The
venom
puts
the
subject
And
they
torture
him.
With
shocks
and
beatings,
And
then
all
of
that
Associated
with
other
They
can
change
To
make
her
seem
HAYMITCH:
They
turned
him
To
kill
you.
But
you
can
reverse
it?
The
fear
is
the
most
We're
hardwired
to
remember
fear
best.
It's
new
terrain.
But
we've
put
together
a
team.
I'm
optimistic.

Good
evening.
Yesterday,
I
authorized
a
covert
rescue
mission
I
am
pleased
to
announce
that
the
Victors
have
been
liberated!
Let
this
day
mark
With
The
Mockingjay
we
have
sent
a
clear
That
we
will
never

Today,
a
day
on
which
we
reunited
family,
friends,
and
loved
ones.
Let
all
of
Panem
come
together.
Not
to
battle
But
to
join
hands
in
this
fight.

Let
today
be
never
to
give
up,
until
we
have
where
leaders
are
elected,
And
where
the
districts
are
free
to
share
the
fruits
of
their
labors
and
not
fight
one
another
for
scraps!

This
new
Panem
is
on
the
horizon.
But
we
must
take
The
road
there
and
deep
ravines
of
District
2.
There
in
the
heart
of
Panem's
steepest
the
Capitol's
principal
military
facility.
We
can
conquer
this
stronghold
because
we
are
one
people,
one
army,
one
voice.
Because
today
is
our
new
beginning.
Today
we
have
freed
the
Victors.
Tomorrow,
Panem!
ALL:

Hoorah!
Hoorah!
Hoorah!
