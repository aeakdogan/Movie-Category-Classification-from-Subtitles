lSABELLA:
John..
.
Your
Majesty.
An
English
princess
by
a
piece
of
French
pastry!
Aren't
you
ashamed?
The
shame
is
surely
his.
Then
go
in
and
tell
him.
Mewling
at
his
keyhole
John.

Oh,
God!
What
in
heaven..
.
Mademoiselle,
you
will
excuse
me.
No,
I
don't.
Ask
her.

Mother,
please,
have
you
no
decency?
I
happen
to
be
in
a
condition

-Yes,
I
know,
but
it's
my
mother.
On
second
thoughts,
I
think
it
better
Though
I
will
not
have
you
in
my
presence.
Mother.
The
purpose
of
my
being
in
this
room
from
the
consequences
Her
uncle
is
the
bloody
King
of
France.

-My
uncle
is..
.

Her
uncle
wants
her
back.
Philip
wants
an
excuse
to
cross
the
Channel
with
an
army.
And
you
have
given
him
that
excuse.
Take
up
your
lawful
wife
and
save
England.
My
lawful
wife
is
as
barren
as
a
brick.
Is
that
truly
the
wife
you
want
for
me?
Hmm?
You,
who
honored
your
husband
so
that
even
now
you
have
a
king
and
the
runt
of
the
litter
Better
the
bastard
of
a
servant
girl
than
bed
the
niece
Or
bed
her
and
wed
her,
Mother.
I've
asked
the
Pope's
men
And
do
you
think
the
Pope
will
favor
England's
royal
runt
He
might
see
his
way
And
for
the
future
King
of
England.
Richard
the
Lion
Heart
is
40-years-old,
And
no
babies.
I
am
a
queen
in
the
making.
Yes.
Yes.
You
see?
She
is
my
Eleanor.
ROBlN:
Now,
you
do
understand,
It's
about
the
science
of
memory
ALLAN:
Who'd
like
to
take
Caught
this
morning.
We
have
a
pheasant.
ROBlN:
Three
choices.
Right,
left
or
middle?
Middle.
''The
middle,''
he
says.
The
middle.
I'm
sorry
about
those
onions,
young
man.
Robin!
Over
here,
they're
needed
for
the
pot.
Feisty
one!
Aye,
what
else
we
got,
what
else
we
got?
ROBERT:
The
fire
will
do
its
work.
We
break
through
at
first
light.
With
a
fair
wind,
You
return
to
Nottingham?
I
have
a
wife
who
waits
for
me.
I
have
a
mother
that
won't
die
and
a
brother
who
wishes
me
dead.
First
thing
I'm
going
to
do
is
lock
them
up.
Your
people
will
rejoice
And
that
is
a
condition
To
be
remembered
as
I
was.
My
army
knows
better.
Lion
Heart
is
mangy.
Every
man
in
that
army
idolizes
you,
Don't
mollycoddle
me.
I
understand
how
difficult
it
must
be
Come
on,
Loxley.
Let
us
see
if
we
can
find
an
honest
man.
Yes.
Let's
do
that.

Well,
that's
the
thing,
little
man.
It's
about
the
science
of
memory
I've
got
a
quick
eye.
I'll
be
watching
you.
ROBlN:
Three
choices.
Right,
left,
or
middle.
I
think
I'll
take
a
fourth
choice.
-A
fourth?
I've
been
watching
you
There
is
no
pea.

This
game
is
a
trick!
You
take
out
the
pea
when
you're
doing
I
got
you.

Don't
touch
it
again.
I'll
do
it!


You
lose.

WlLL:
You're
doing
better
than
you
think.
Get
in
there,
Robin.

Kneel,
you
ignorant
bastards!
Kneel
before
the
King!

All
of
you,
move
back,
now.
No,
no,
Loxley.
Sinners
after
mine
own
heart.
Which
one
of
you
started
the
fight?
I
did,
Sire.
I
threw
the
first
punch.
Ah,
honest
man.
And
who're
you
fighting?
He
was
fighting
me,
Your
Majesty.
I
thought
him
to
be
a
lesser
man.
He
was
showing
me
different.
An
enemy
that
shows
his
respect.
Stand
up,
the
pair
of
you.
Not
you.
Brave
and
honest.
Are
you
honest
enough
to
tell
a
king
What
is
your
opinion
on
my
crusade?
Will
God
be
pleased
with
my
sacrifice?
No,
he
won't.
Why
do
you
say
that?
The
massacre
at
Acre,
Sire.
Speak
up!
When
you
had
us
herd
2,500
Muslim
men,
the
young
woman
at
my
feet,
There
wasn't
fear
in
her
eyes.
There
was
only
pity.
For
she
knew
that
when
you
gave
the
order
and
our
blades
that,
in
that
moment,
we
would
be
godless.
All
of
us.
Godless.
Honest,
brave
and
na√Øve.
There
is
your
Englishman.
Right
there.
-Well
done,
Robin.
The
whipping
will
be
the
worst
of
it.
The
branding
iron,
that
will
be
the
worst.
Unless
they
hang
us.
ROBlN:
No.
No,
this
will
be
the
worst
of
it.
And
this
will
be
the
end
of
it.
I
don't
owe
God
or
any
other
man
here


We
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
same
breast.
Wet
nurse.
lndeed.
We've
been
close
ever
since.
Good.
Because
England,
under
your
friend
John,
is
a
country
with
no
fighting
spirit.
I
can
take
London
with
an
army
of
cooks.
But
Richard
is
on
his
way
home.
And
under
Richard,
Richard
will
return
home
We
know
the
exact
place.
He
always
travels
ahead
of
his
army
With
Richard
dead,
it
will
be
easy
for
you
There'll
never
be
a
better
moment
to
invade.

Even
dying
animals
can
be
obstinate.
Kill

Lion
Heart



ALL:
Heave!
Heave!

Heave!
For
England!

For
England!

I
need
a
physician
here!
SOLDlER:
A
physician!
Quickly!
Give
us
cover!
Give
us
cover,
now!
Cover
him!
Cover
the

Physician!
Why,
Loxley?
Are
you
not
feeling
well?
ROBERT:
Physician!
Wine.
What's
this?
-The
King
is
dead!
Dead.
All
right,
then,
Jimmy.
Knock
the
pegs
out.
I'll
come
with
you.
No,
you're
not.
We
don't
take
strays.
The
more
the
merrier.
The
road
will
be
dangerous.
Where
we
going?
To
the
coast
and
to
a
boat
and
the
price
for
a
Channel
crossing
What
about
our
wages?
If
you
thought
it
was
hard
getting
wages
try
getting
paid
by
a
dead
king.
All
right,
boys,

FRlAR
TUCK:
I
like
the
new
church.
Lady
Marion.
I
would
have
been
sorry
to
leave
I'm
glad
to
speed
you
on
your
way,
but
it
was
to
seek
out
our
new
shepherd.
You
have
lately
been
missed
I
like
a
quiet
church,
Father,
Your
new
flock
is
women,
Our
men
have
gone
to
war
Their
orphans
run
wild
in
the
greenwood.
Our
fields
are
ready
for
planting
And
the
church
barn
is
full
of
grain.
Surely,
you
do
not
expect
the
church
to
let
its
corn
be
used
to
plant
your
fields?
That
grain
is
bound
for
York.
I
am
Friar
Tuck.
Father
Tancred
is
elevated
to
York
where
I
know
he
will
remind
the
Bishop
The
Bishop
does
not
need
reminding
should
reap
what
they
sow
The
miracle
I
pray
for
is
that
As
I
said,
Father,
You
will
have
trouble

You
keep
bees,
Tuck?
I
keep
them
and
they
keep
me.
Stop!
Ambush!



You're
a
knight?
Where
is
King
Richard?
Oh,
God.
Where
is
the
King?
-Dead.
Really?
If
the
King's
dead,
where
are
you
going?
Deliver
the
crown.
Richard's
crown.
Richard's
crown.
How
do
we
assassinate
a
king

GODFREY:
Bring
back
the
crown!

You
are
English.
When
it
suits
me.
Who
are
you?
Robert
Loxley.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
That's
the
King's
horse.
WlLL:
Jimmy!
Move!
ROBlN:
Jimmy!
ALLAN:
Robin,
they're
French.
Ambush.

Go.

John.
Don't
know.
He's
dead.
ROBERT:

Help.
My
sword.
lts
value
to
me
is
great.
It
belonged
to
my
father,
Sir
Walter
Loxley
of
Nottingham.
Do
you
know
it?
Aye,
I've
heard
of
Nottingham.

Then
the
fate..
.
The
fates
have
smiled
on
me.

You
must
take
the
sword
to
my
father.
It
will
bring
me
peace.
I
took
it
in
anger
and
without
his
consent.
You
must
understand
the
bond
of
love
between
a
father
and
his
son.
My
father
abandoned
me
to
the
world
of
men
I
know
little
of
the
love
I
beg
you.
Longstride,
say
you
will.
I
will.
It's
a
pact
sworn
in
blood,
Robin.
It's
a
scratch,
Allan,
and
that's
all
it
is.
WlLL:
Robin!
Loxley
was
making
for
the
coast
That
crown
could
be
our
passage
home.
We're
common
archers,
Robin.
If
we
arrive
at
the
King's
ship
How
do
you
know
that
the
knights
you
see
walking
about
There
is
no
difference
between
a
knight
and
any
other
man
All
we
need
is
about
us.
Armor,
helmets,
swords,
and
we
make
England
wealthy
men
with
horses
and
gold.
Fate
has
smiled
upon
us
at
last.
And
I,
for
one,
shall
not
turn
my
back
on
her.
Take
that
crown
off
your
head,
Will,
and
fill
it
to
the
brim.
ROBlN:
We
commit
the
soul
of
this
boy
We
would
ask,
when
he
arrives
if
you
could
let
him
in.

PAUL:
Goliath's
got
the
soil
turning
nicely.
-Nettles?
that'll
keep
us
alive.
Come,
Goliath.
This
way.
Until
we
get
a
miracle.
MARlON:
This
way.
TOM:
Marion,
Sheriff.
SHERlFF:
Marion,
I've
been
at
Peper
Harow,
for
Sir
Walter
to
receive
me.
Kindly
tell
him
I
have
better
things
to
do
That
you
have,
That's
sheriff's
business.
Tell
the
old
fool
that
next
time,
-And
if
he's
too
proud
to
pay..
.
He's
too
poor.
In
the
name
of
King
Richard,
to
pay
for
foreign
adventures.
Whilst
at
home,
the
Church,
has
reaped,
without
mercy,
the
largest
share
Between
a
sheriff
and
a
bishop,
who's
the
greater
curse

Marion,
why,
oh,
why
do
you
make
an
enemy
of
me
when
you
have
the
means
What
means?
If
you
leave
now,
I
will
lengthen
your
life
of
your
visit
when
he
returns
home.

Your
husband?
After
10
years?
If
he's
not
dead,
he's
rutting
his
way
So
speaks
a
man
of
experience.
Well,
think
on
it,
Marion.
Sir
Walter
is
dying
without
an
heir.
Peper
Harow
will
fall
to
the
crown,
You'll
be
glad
to
come
to
me
then.
Captain,
there.
Sir,
we
were
told
Our
beloved
King
is
dead.
Long
live
the

Long

And

are,

Sir
Robert
Loxley

And

I'm

Come

And

When

done,
be
ready
to
ride.
What
if..
.
What
if
Loxley
is
known
to
the
King's
mother
or
brother
Then
we'll
be
riding
for
our
lives.
Jesus,
Mary
and
Joseph.
I
knew

I

EQUERRY:
Good

Some
words
of
advice
You

so
you
will
present
the

You
will
go

Do
not
look

And
do
not
rise
until
all
others
rise.
Yes.
ELEANOR:

My

Yes,
My

AGNES:

MAN:
Cease.
What's
this?
What's
happening?
King
Richard

from
France,

Did

ELEANOR:

PRlNCE
JOHN:
Welcome
then.
And
how
did
my
brother
die?
In
battle,
Your
Majesty,
as
was
his

As
was
his

You
deserve
a
reward..

ALLAN:

Let's

the
horses.
PRlNCE
JOHN:

.for
bringing
home
the

Kneel.
Did
you
say
you
were
from
Nottingham?
Yes.
Your
father,
Sir
Walter,
owes
tax
to
the
crown.
My
crown.
Tell
him
it's
bloody
expensive
and
everyone's
got
to
pay
their
way.
We'll
start
with
this.
MAN:
Make

Make

Your

MAN:
Make

for
the

-Make
way!
Godfrey,
my
friend.
It's
so
good
to
see
you.
-How
were
your
travels?
What
happened
to
your
face?
A
hunting
accident.
It's
nothing.

-Frightening.
Call
it
a
dueling
scar.
I
bow
to
your
knowledge
of
the
ladies,
Sire.
You
can
get
up
now.
MARSHAL:
Sir
Robert.
You
will
know
of
me,
perhaps.
Your
father
and
I
were
young
men
together.
Tell
him
I'm
coming
to
visit
him
soon,
I
may
have
need
of
him.
I
will.
I'll
tell
him.
Whoever
he
is
and
whatever
he
is,
Get
rid
of
him.
Come
on,
let's
follow.


Forfeit
what
you
got.
Victuals,
coin,
clothing
or
your
life.

Thomas
Cooper.
Is
that
you?
Are
you
sick,
Thomas?
We're
all
sick.
-Where
are
the
rest
of
you?
Loop

be
angry.
No,
it's
your
mother
Now,
either
you
come
with
me,
You
choose.
Well,
come
on
then.
Where
are
they?
Answer
me.
Four
men,
five
horses,
one
gray.
-Have
you
seen
them?

you
not

a

Sing
a

No.
Sing
something
about

A

Fancy

darling
I'll
climb
up
to
your
chamber
ROBlN:
Right.
I'm
done.
The
money's
divided.
And
so
should
we
be.
Where
will
you
go?
I
think
something
is
owed
and
I
mean
to
pay
it
back.
How
so?
The
inscription
on
the
sword,
Maybe
it's
just
my
imagination,
I
don't
know.
But
I
intend
to
take
that
sword
and
fulfill
the
request
of
his
dying
son.
WlLL:
Are
you
mad?
You
just
said
we
were
in
danger,
Robin.
Now
you
choose
to
step
back
They're
bound
to
go
there
and
find
you.
We
can't
repay
our
good
luck
-I'm
going
with
you.
-Yes.
Tonight
is
our
last
in
company.
Tomorrow,
we
go
our
separate
ways.
Pack
up
your

We

Will.

Bastards!
They've
stolen
my

Richard's
army
is
coming
home.
It
costs
money
to
keep
it
together.
MARSHAL:
I
do,
Sire.
But
to
disband
the
army

King
Richard's
campaigns
were
costly.
What
is
that
to
me,
Marshal?
My
brother's
troubles
are
over!
They're
over!
Clear
the
room.
So..
.
Taxation.
ELEANOR:
Taxation?

Mother,
spare
me
your

You

none,
These

I

Your

The

The
northern

plead
poverty,
So,
what's
to

done?
Give
me

Sire,
to

I'll
have

their

No

to

And
loyalty
means
paying
your

That's
well
said.
Hmm?
Don't
you
think,
Marshal?
Mother?
Richard
commanded
loyalty
Mother,
your
sainted
son
was
an
imbecile.
And
you
supported
his
every
folly
Yes,
you
worshipped
him
when
the
warrior
lost
territories
You
kissed
his
picture
while
England
had
to
pay
to
ransom
him
when
he
was
captured.
You
are
just
as
much
to
blame
as
anyone
for
the
wreckage
which
is
my

I
broke

Marshal,
you
served
my

faithfully
I
think
you've
spent
enough

and,
no

Therefore,
and
with
regret,
I
accept
your

I

Plain

No

No,

No

Are

No,
I'm

This

He'll

Ma'am,
Sir

I

Tell

I'm

I

apology.
Bad

I
owe
you
thanks
for
taking
the

Did
you

Yes.
Did
he

In
an
ambush,
ma'am.
He
was
the
man

WALTER:
Marion,
who
is
here?
MARlON:
A
traveler,

This

will
go
very
hard
on
him.
WALTER:
Bring
him
in.
MARlON:
Yes,
yes.
Tell
him
Robert

Travelers

Is
that
not
so?
Your

Longstride.
Robin
Longstride.
Do
you
mock
me?
Sir?
Your
son,
he
asked
me
to
bring
you
this.
And
how
does
Robert
defend
himself
The
prodigal
son
will
not
return
after
all.

So,
no
tears,
no
forgiveness
from
his
father.

No
amends
to
be
made.
Did
you
see
him
die?
I
was
with
him
when
he
passed.
His
final
words
were
for
the
love
and
bond
Forgive
my
rudeness.
My
grief

been
waiting
for
this

So
come,
so
that
I
may
see
you.

but
noble

So,
you
will
dine
with
us.
But
first,
you
must
bathe,
sir.
You
stink.
I've
laid

I'll

You've
taken
a
long
road
to
bring
this

me.
I
cannot

Marion,
I'm
merely
trying
to
gauge

Yes.
In
the
way

Entertain
us
We
don't
get
many
visitors
anymore.
Except
tax
collectors

other
beggars.
I
don't
know
where
I'm

WALTER:
So,
Marion,
I
don't
yet

I
have
a
proposal
for
you,
young
man.
You
brought
me
this
sword,
If
you
give
me
your
time,
it
is
yours.
I
could

have
a
question
to
ask
you.
The
words
on
the
hilt
of
the
sword,
Well,
I
think
I
have
much
to
tell
you
That's
very
kind.
Well,

want
you

stay
in

Oh,
that's
enough!
-You've
had
too
much
to
drink.
We
both
know
that
without
a
husband
Do
you
dispute
that?
Hmm?
-No.
he
will
be
seen
as
that.
It
is
a
fair
contract.
It
is
not
as
if
I
expect
you
No,

your
time,
Longstride.
Are
you
in
agreement?
-Yes.

my

Hey!
Hey!
I
rose
up

I

Come
over

So,
why
do

you

to
get
at?
I'm
proportionate.

And
pour
another
cup

two

Stop
it.
What
did
I
tell
you?
It
seems
we
are
to
share
my

A
ruse
to
convince
the

Well,

the

is
deception,

Hello,

Where
are
your

They're
dead,
My

And
Loxley?
Alive.
Then
fate
has
left
him
to
me.

I
hear
a
man's
steps.
Good
morning,
my

Morning,

Father.
ROBlN:
Father.
So
what
is
it
that

Patience.
You

yourself

I'm

WALTER:
I

I
woke
this
morning
with
a
tumescent
glow.
Eighty-four.
A
miracle.
I've
always
wondered
Husband.
This
is
rich
country.
Where's
your
cattle
and
your
sheep?
Sold,
eaten,
stolen,
traded.
Our
meat
now
is
rabbit
or
wild

a
lucky
day.
And
deer?
If
you're
willing
to
risk
your
neck
Every
deer
in
the

These
things
are
God's
gifts

If
it's
illegal
for
a
man
to
fend
for
himself
how
then
can
he
be
a

in
his
own
right?
Welcome
home,

Sir

Will

With

For

Well

A

rash
but
well

Ah,

Good

There
are
wolves
in
York,
Sir
Robert.
The
bees
are
my
family.
I'm
a
procreator
by
design.
I'm
not
a
churchy
friar.
Never
was.
My
bees
give
life.
They
are
my
life,
Sir

Should
not
the
Bishop
be
told
so
the
clergy
can
spread
What
if
the

were
not
to

Then
the
bees
need
not
be
spoken
of.
MARlON:
I
was

I

a
daughter
of
a
respectable

We

then
a
week
later
he
left

And
that
was
my
married
life

a
man
I
hardly
knew.
-A
good

I
mean,
he
was
a
good
knight.
A
good
knight-at-arms,
a

Oh,
yes,
And
I

his.

Stop!
You'll
break
its
neck.

Easy.

I'm
all
right.
I
can't
move

I
can't
move
me
legs.
Thank
you.
My

Oh,
is
it
my

now?
Thank
you.
Nicely
done,

And
to

Loxley's

I
don't

Allow
me
to
introduce
Welcome
home,
Sir

You
make
your

quickly
What's
this?
What's
mine
in

I
have
the
right
If
it's
God's
will.
Here's
a
ram's
worth
of

Your
insolence
to
Lady
Marion,
Mead
and
grain
alcohol?
I
thought
as
much.
There's
something
that
we
need
to
do.
At
your
service.

ROBlN:
All
right,
lads.
Should've
left
while
you
had
the
chance.

DEACON:
Stop.
Stop
the
horses.
You
there!
Move
aside!
ROBlN:
None
shall
pass
unless
they
can
answer
the
riddle.
Moon-mad!
And
what
is
the
riddle,
you
insolent
wretch?
What
has
18
legs
and
isn't
going
anywhere?
Your
next
move
will
be
your
last.
Evening,
friend.
DEACON:
I
demand
to
know
who
you
are.
ROBlN:
We
are
men
of
the

Merry
now,
at
your
expense.
''The
Lord

'
And
we
shall

My
advice
is
to
plant
it
now,
by
moonlight.
Why
is
that,
good
friar?
When
it
sprouts,
The
Church
in
York
DEACON:
How
much
further?

I
thought
you
had
left.
The
fields
have
been
planted.
I
didn't
want
to
wake
you.
How
did
you
find
the
seed?
If
you
have
to
ask,
it's
not
a
gift.
Thank
you.

I
have
lost
the

but
he

still
listen
to

Allow
me
to
know
better,

You

I
dare

I've

EDWARD:

John

Leaving

So
it's

My

An

A

Why

telling

ELEANOR:

It
is

Tell

Why
not
tell

Oh!
A

mistrusts
No.
If

No,

That

unkind.
You
were

Yes.
Did
you
hear
that,
boys?
-My

are
good

a
man.
You
don't
become
the
creatures
you
hunt.
-We're
soldiers.
Soldiers
fight
for
a
cause.
What's
yours?
You
don't
have
one.

Common
thieves
with
a
lot
to
learn.
Like
what?
I
could
teach
you
how
to
tie
knots.
I
could
teach
you
which
wood
to
get
I
could
teach
you
how
to
make
arrows
And
I
can
help
Marion
to
teach
you
so
you
won't
get
sick.
I
don't
know
who
you're
fighting,
son,
If
you
want
to
chat,
Wife?
PRlNCE
JOHN:
Marshal.
MAN:
Stand
aside!
Make
way
for
the
King!
Your
Majesty.
What
the
devil
are
you
doing
here?
Hmm?
Sire?
Will
you
keep
that
animal
still?
Do
you
think
I
haven't
noticed
If
Your
Majesty
recalls,
At
our
last
conversation,
Philip
of
France
wasn't
coming
our
way
Was
he,
Marshal?
My
friend
Godfrey
is
not
the
friend
I
thought
he
was.
He's
stirred
up
They
come
south
with
an
army.
Marshal,
how
dare
they?
How
dare
they?
Sire,
forgotten
men
are
dangerous
men.
The
barons
need
to
be
told
that
when
the
French
come,
-Fitzrobert.
We'll
make
an
army
of
the
north
The
barons
need
leadership.
Wiser
kings
know
hear
their
voice.
Together,
let
us
ride
north
to
meet
them.
They
march
against
their
king,
Marshal.
Their
king.
We
will
meet
them
with
the
pikes
You
have
lost
your
touch,
Marshal.
Perhaps
we'll
look
to
the
barons
Saddle
up
with
a
spare
horse.
I
want
to
know
where
to
find
Godfrey.
My
Lord.
-I
found
him,
My
Lord.
Nottingham.
Then
we
go
to
Nottingham.
Take
no
prisoners.
Take
two
men,
four
horses.
Ride
hard
for
the
coast,
then
on
to
Paris

I'll
make
the
place
famous.
Come,
Allan!
I'll
get
them
drinking.
You
get
them
dancing!
All
right.


WALTER:
Music,
laughter,
Life
has
returned.



How
did
you
know
it
was
me?
Who
else
would
sit
by
me
uninvited
like
a
friend
from
the
old
days?
How
are
you,
William?
I'm
well
and
troubled.
Ah.
And
what
brings
you?
I'm
riding
on
to
Barnsdale
tonight.
I've
heard
something
of
the
barons'
anger
The
anger
has
turned
into
action.
They
assemble
to
march
against
the
King.
You
think
you
can
persuade
the
barons
Turn
back,
no.
To
join
King
John
against
a
French
invasion.
-A
what?
I
cannot
go
with
you.
I
cannot
speak
for
this
king.
He
is
the
only
king
we
have.
But
not
the
only
hope.
Explain.
-Marion.
WALTER:
This
is
my
old
friend,
Lady
Marion
Loxley,
my
son's
wife.
Lady,
I
was
glad
to
see
Sir
Robert
WALTER:
I
think
you
know
better,
Marshal.
Sir
William,
I
know,
We've
met
before.
Yes,
Sir,
I
know.
In
London.
No,
when
you
were
a
child.
Hobby-horse
age.
Sir
Walter
and
I
returned
from
the
Holy
Land
But
you'd
gone.
We
had
lost
Thomas
Longstride's
son.
It
was
a
wound
that
never
healed.
WALTER:
You
need
to
know
what
I
know.
Your
father
was
a
stonemason.
Is
that
pleasing
to
you?
Yes.
It
is.
But
he
was
more
than
that.
What
did
he
see?
That
kings
have
a
need
of
their
subjects
no
less
than
their
subjects
A
dangerous
idea.
Your
father
was
a
philosopher.
that
took
you
by
the
ears
and
by
the
heart.
None
of
these
things
You
must
commit
them
to
your
very
soul.
This
is
the
science
of
memory.
''Rise
and
rise
again
Finally,
hundreds
listened,
for
the
rights
of
all
ranks
from
baron
to
serf.
''Rise
and
rise
again
''until
lambs
become
lions.'
'

What
happened
to
him?
Close
your
eyes.
THOMAS:
...
foundation
is
set
on
SOLDlER:
Longstride,
give
up
the
charter
WALTER:
You
were
there.
You
saw
it.
I
will
not.

Not
dead.
Not
now.
Not
now.
WALTER:
Here
is
my
copy
This
charter
of
rights
And
here
are..
.
There
are
the
names
Fitzrobert,
Baldwin,
Marshal
and
myself.
What
he
wanted
-Wait
there.
Sir
Walter?
A
messenger
for
you.
WALTER:
Bring
him
in.
Step
forward,
sir.
-My
Lord.
Peterborough's
been
burned
Fitzrobert
gathers
an
army
Marshal
requests
your
presence
Wait
outside,
will
you?
Cometh
the
hour,
cometh
the
man.
The
time
for
pretense
is
over.
Now,
hold
me
like
a
son.
Go.
Maggie.
Where's
my
lady?
I
could
not
find
her,
sir.
Whether
we
fight
for
our
lives,
we
must
fight
till
the
death.
You've
spent
too
long
in
the
palace,
William.
Spending
time
in
the
palace
As
we
speak,
King
Philip
sails
for
our
coast.
Godfrey
and
his
marauders
are
French!
Every
minute
that
we
waste
in
disunity
brings
closer
the
destruction
of
our
country!
FlTZROBERT:
We
have
been
bled
by
the
King
long
before
Godfrey.

Go
back
to
London
and
tell
the
King
that
we
will
meet
him
MAN:
Make
way!
BALDWlN:
We
will
not
fight
Rather
let
him
bend
the
knee
to
us.
PRlNCE
JOHN:
I'll
give
you
more,
My
breast
for
your
sword
point.
Use
mine.
Go
on.
No?
Oh,
this
is
what
you
want,
isn't
it?
Fine,
I'd
rather
give
it
to
you
You
mistake
me,
Sire.
I
have
no
right
and
no
ambition
But
let
the
rightful
wearer
beware.
From
now
we
will
be
subject
only
We
are
not
sheep

Godfrey
set
himself
to
turn
you
against
me.
Then
he
did
more
than
was
needed
BALDWlN:
A
very
important
decision.
Don't
you
think
that
we've
paid


This
is
where
I
was
born.
-What
does
it
mean?
FlTZROBERT:
We
will
not
be
loyal
to
a
crown
The
King
must
listen
to
what
we
have
to
say!
A
king
does
not
bargain
for
the
loyalty
Without
loyalty
there
is
no
kingdom.
I'm
here
to
speak
for
Sir
Walter
Loxley.
SOLDlER
1
:
Let
the
man
speak.
ALL:
Speak!
Speak!
Speak,
if
you
must.
If
you're
trying
to
build
for
the
future,
you
must
set
your
foundation
strong.
The
laws
of
this
land
a
king
who
demands
loyalty
I
have
marched
from
France
to
Palestine
and
back.
And
I
know
in
tyranny
lies
only
failure.
You
build
a
country
from
the
ground
up.

Empower
every
man
and
you
will
gain
strength.
Hmm.
Well,
who
could
object
If
Your
Majesty
were
to
offer
justice,
justice
in
the
form
of
a
charter
of
liberties,
allowing
every
man
to
forage
for
his
hearth,
to
be
safe
from
conviction
without
cause
or
prison
without
charge,
to
work,
eat
and
live
-and
be
as
merry
as
he
can..
.
...then
that
king
would
be
great.
Not
only
would
he
receive
but
their
love,
as
well.
So
what
would
you
have?
Hmm?
Castle
for
every
man?

Every
Englishman's
home
is
his
castle.

What
we
would
ask,
Your
Majesty,
is
liberty.
Liberty
by
law!
MARSHAL:
Your
Majesty,
My
Lords,
the
French
fleet
is
in
the
Channel.
Sire,
you
have
a
chance
It
falls
on
your
nod.
I
only
have
to
nod?
I
can
do
better
than
that.
I
give
my
word
that
such
a
charter
will
be
written.
On
my
mother's
life,
I
swear
it.

Godfrey
makes
for
Nottingham.
I
will
send
Baldwin
and
Fitzrobert
with
you.
We
will
meet
again
at
the
White
Horse
Robin,
your
father
was
a
great
man.
And
you
are

I
call
for
Robert
Loxley.
My
son
is
not
here
to
answer
you.
That
is
the
truth.
Because
he's
dead
in
a
French
ditch.
And
who
are
you,
sir,
to
say
so?
Who
am
I?
I'm
the
one
who
killed
him.

Fight
me
if
you
dare.
Lord
have
mercy.


Leave

To
