Sheila,

so

exactly
so.
Thank
you,

But
I
wasn't

The
word
that
I
used
was
"love."
Love
like
the
love
of
a

I
propose
that
we
build
A
robot-child
who
will
genuinely
love

a

that
will
never

A

But
a

what
I'm
suggesting
is

world

occurs
to
me...
...with
all
this
animus
existing
...it
isn't
simply
a
question
But
isn't
the
real
conundrum,
Ours

be
a

loving,
With
all
the
childless
couples

little
Mecha
will
not
only
open
up

will
fill

great
human
need.
But
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
If
a
robot
could
genuinely
love
a
person...
...what
responsibility
does

I'll

Good.
I

Henry,
did
you
see
his

He's
so
real.
-But
he's
not.
-I
mean,
inside,
he's
like

isn't

to

Right

...don't

Silly

Of

I'm

LAUGHS





Is
it
a
game?
Now,
I'm
gonna
read
some
words.
And,
um,
they
won't
make
any
sense,
And
look
at
me
all
the
time.
Can
you
do
that?
Yes,
Monica.
Can
you
feel
my
hand
Yes.
-Does
any
of
this
hurt?
Okay,
now...
...look
at
me.
Ready?
Cirrus.
Socrates.
Particle.
Decibel.
Hurricane.
Dolphin.
Tulip.
Monica.
David.
Monica.
All
right.
I
wonder
if
I
did
that
right.

What
were
those
words
for,
Mommy?
What
did
you
call
me?
Mommy.
Who
am
I,
David?
You
are
my
mommy.


You
smell
lovely.
I
love
it
-Will
you
still
love
me
when
it's
all
gone?
Ha,
ha,
stop
it!
We
can
get
married
again
and
begin
with
-Ha,
ha.

-Hello,
David.
Walk
us
out,
all
right,
sweetheart?
My
shoe!

-Your
tie!
You're
hopeless!
MONICA:
He's
trying
so
hard
to
please
me.
It's
creepy.
You
can
never
hear
him
coming.
-He
is
only
a
child.
He's
a
gift.
From
you.
David,
when
we
leave,
...so
you
can't
leave
your
room,
-Oh,
l
put
way
too
much
on.
Oh,
God,
no!

DAVID:
Will
you
die?
Well,
one
day,
David,
yes,
I
will.
I'll
be
alone.
Don't
worry
yourself
so.
How
long
will
you
live?
For
ages.
For
50
years.

I
hope
you
never
die.
Never.
Yes.
HENRY:
We're
becoming
unfashionably,
Hello?
This
belonged
to
Martin,
my
son.

His
name
is
Teddy.
-Hello,
Teddy.
David,
Teddy
is
a
supertoy.
I
know
I
am
not
a
toy.
MONICA:
-Sorry!
MONICA:
Is
50
years
a
long
time?
I
don't
think
so.

David,
I'll
get
it!
-Honey,
hand
it
to
me.

WOMAN
:

Yes?
WOMAN:
l
have
an
urgent
call
from
your
husband.
Yes,
I
will.
HENRY
:
-Let
the
phone
talk
now.
-Run
along,
play
with
Teddy.
Hello,
Henry,
what
is
it?
What?
When?
Oh,
God.
David.
The
most
wonderful
thing
This
is
Martin.
This
is
my
son.
Martin,
no!
We'll
have
a
contest
to
see
Come
here,
Teddy!
Come
here!
Teddy!
Come
here!
-You
call
him
too.
MARTIN:
Come
on.
Teddy!
-Come
here!
Come
on,
Teddy.
MARTIN:
Teddy,
come.
-Come
here,
Teddy.
TEDDY:
MONICA:
He
used
to
be
a
supertoy,
but...
...now
he's
old
and
stupid.
You
want
him?
Yes,
please.
Now
you're
the
new
supertoy.
Can
you
do
power
stuff,
Anti-gravity,
like
float
or
fly?
Can
you?
No,
because
I'm
real.
Can
you
break
this?
I
better
not.
These
things,
they
do
look
better
I
can't.

Stand
up.
-Look,
they
made
you
bigger
than
me.
They
did.
The
dollmakers.
Why
don't
you
look
like
one?
Like
one?
You're
not
cute
like
a
doll.
You
just
look
like
someone's
ordinary
kid.
When's
your
birthday?
I
never
had
a
birthday.
Okay.
When
were
you
first
built?
I
don't
remember.

Okay,
what's
the
first
thing
A
bird.
What
sort
of
bird?
A
bird
with
big
wings...
...and
feathers
sticking
up
Can
you
draw
it?
Yes.
That
looks
like
a
peacock.
Peacock.
-Can
you
say
"pee"?
Now
say
that
two
times
fast.
Okay.
Then
you
gotta
put
MARTIN:
Read
to
us?
Let's
see.
Oh,
yeah.
David's
going
to
love
it.
MONICA:
"As
soon
as
the
show
was
over,
...where
the
sheep,
...was
roasting
on
the
slowly
turning
spit
When
he
saw
there
was

called
Harlequin

me

is
made

nice,
dry

And
instead
of
making
Then
he
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep.
As
he
slept,
he
dreamt
he
saw
...who
gave
him
a
kiss,
saying:
'Brave
Pinocchio...
...in
return
for
your
good
heart,
Be
good
in
future,
and
you
will
be
happy.'
Then
the
dream
ended
You
can
imagine
how
astonished
...that
he
was
no
longer
a
puppet...
...but
a
real
boy,
just
like
other
boys."
Josephine,
evidently,
MONICA:
Oh,
my
God.
MONICA:
HENRY:
How?
They
were
fabulous
together.
HENRY:
He
never
said
they
were
miserable.
Is
that
because
of
the
cutbacks?
HENRY:
MONICA:
HENRY:
MONICA:
HENRY:
There's
something
You
will
break.
-Oh.
That
is
ridiculous!

HENRY:
Work
has
become
so
silly.

HENRY:
Does
he
eat?
HENRY:
You're
not
supposed
to
do
that.
Have
the
manual,
the
book?
-Martin,
put
the
fork
down!
Martin,
you're
provoking
him.
Stop
it.
-Stop
it,
David!
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
David,
stop
it!

MARTlN:
lf
you
do
something
really,

special
mission...
...then
I'll
go
tell
Mommy...
...I
love
you.
And
then
she'll
love
you
too.
What
shall
I
do?
You
have
to
promise,
You
have
to
tell
me,
I
want
a
lock
of
Mommy's
hair.
I'll
share
it
with
you.
...she
might
love
you
even
more.
Like
the
princess
When
she
had
the
prince's
hair

loved
her.
We
can
ask
her.
No,
it
has
to
be
a
secret
mission.

Sneak
into
Mommy's
bedroom
...and
chop
it
off.
I
can't,
Martin.
I'm
not
allowed.
You
promised.
You
said,
"Tell
me,
and
then
I'll
promise."
Didn't
you?
MONICA:
Ah!
Aah!
Why
did
you
do
that?
Talk
to
me!
Goddamn
it,
talk
to
me!
Henry,
you're
hurting
him!
You're
hurting
him!
You'll
break

wanted
Mommy
to
love

I

was
playing

It
was

Why
do
you
keep
imagining
Because
we
don't
know
the
answer
How
is
he
worth
the
risk
to
you,
I
won't
let
you
take
him
back.
You
told

Think
about
this.
If

pushed
to

forever.
She

welcomed

Eventually,
the
floodlights
dimmed
...but
David
could
still
see
her,
And
he
still
addressed
her,
in
hope.
He
prayed
until
all

...he
prayed
as
the
ocean
froze...
...and
the
ice
encased
the

Always
there.
Always
smiling.
Always
awaiting
him.
Eventually,
he
never

...but
his

always
stayed
open...
...staring

the

make
you
a
real
boy.
DAVID:
This
looks
like
my
house,
BLUE
FAlRY:
Yes,
it
is
different.
We
read
your
mind
and
it's
all
here.
There's
nothing
too
small
that
We
so
want
you
to
be
happy.
You
are
so
important
to
us,
David.
You
are
unique
in
all
the
world.
Will
Mommy
be
coming
home
soon?
Is
she
out
shopping
with
Martin
now?
David,
she
can
never
come
home...
...because
2000
years
have
passed...
...and
she
is
no
longer
living.
Dearest
David,
when
you
are
lonely...
...we
can
bring
back
other
people
If
you
can
bring
back
other
people...
...why
can't
you
bring
back
her?!
BLUE
FAlRY:
We
can
only
bring
back
people
We
need
some
physical
sample
...like
a
bone
or
a
fingernail.
David.
Yes,
Teddy?
Do
you
remember
when
you
cut
Henry
shook
me.
And
you
dropped
her
hair?
I
know.
Now
you
can
bring
her
back...
...can't
you?
Give
him
what
he
wants.
BLUE
FAlRY:
Hey,
Joe,
what
do
you
know?


David,
I
often
felt
a
sort
...of
that
thing
they
called
spirit.
Human
beings
had
created
a
million
...in
art,
poetry,
mathematical
formulas.
Certainly
human
beings
must
be
the
key
But
human
beings
no
longer
existed.
So
we
began
a
project...
...that
would
make
it
possible
to
re-create
...from
the
DNA
in
a
fragment
We
also
wondered,
...to
retrieve
a
memory
trace
And
you
know
what
we
found?
We
found
the
very
fabric
...appeared
to
store
information
...which
had
ever
occurred
in
the
past.
But
the
experiment
was
a
failure.
Those
who
were
resurrected
only
lived
When
the
resurrectees
fell
asleep
...they
died
again.
As
soon
as
they
became
unconscious,
...faded
away
into
darkness.
So
you
see,
David,
...that
once
an
individual
space-time
...it
could
not
be
reused.
If
we
bring
your
mother
back
now...
...it
will
only
be
for
one
day...
...and
then
you
will
Maybe....
Maybe
she
will
be
special.
Maybe
she
will
stay.
I
thought
this
would
be
hard
You
were
created
to
be
so
young.
Maybe
the
one
day
will
be
like
Maybe
it
will
last
forever.
SPECIALIST:
...of
the
human
race.
The
most
lasting
proof
of
their
genius.
We
only
want
for
your
happiness.
David...
...you've
had
so
little
of
that.
If
you
want
for
my
happiness...
...then
you
know
what
you
have
to
do.
Listen.

Can
you
hear
that?
The
new
morning
has
come.
Go
to
her,
David.
She's
just
waking
up
this
instant.
I
found
you.
-Hi.
I
must
have
dozed
off.
-How
long--?
Just
the
way
you
like
it?
Yeah,
I'd
love
a
coffee.
It'll
wake
me
up.
Okay.
You
never
forget
how,
do
you?
No.
I
never
forget.
I
must
be
a
little
confused.
What
day
is
it?
It
is
today.
SPECIALIST:
As
the
day
wore
on,
David
All
the
problems
seemed
to
have
There
was
no
Henry,
there
was
no
Martin.
There
was
no
grief.

SPECIALIST:
David
had
been
warned
...otherwise
she'd
be
frightened,
But
David's
journey
home
So
he
didn't
see
the
harm
of
painting
her

SPECIALIST:
...because
David
had
never
been
born.
So
they
baked
a
cake
-Now
make
a
wish.
SPECIALIST:
By
now,
indeed,
David
drew
the
shades
without
I
really
ought
to
be
tucking
you
in.
How
strange.
Hmm.
How
fascinating.
I
can
hardly
keep
my
eyes
open.
I
don't
know
what's
come
over
me.
Such
a
beautiful
day.
I
love
you,
David.
I
do
love
you.
I
have
always
loved
you.
SPECIALIST:
That
was
the
everlasting
And
the
moment
had
passed,
More
than
merely
asleep.
Should
he
shake
her,
So
David
went
to
sleep
too.
And
for
the
first
time
in
his
life...
...he
went
to
that
place...
...where
dreams
are
born.
