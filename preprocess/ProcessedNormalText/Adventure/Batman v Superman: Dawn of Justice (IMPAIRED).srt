VIKRAM
GANDHI:

have
been
looking
for
a
savior.
90%
of
people
believe
in
a
higher
power,
and
every
religion
believes
in
some
sort
of
messianic
figure.
And
when
this
savior
character
we
want
to
make
him
abide
by
our
rules?
We
have
to
understand
that
We
have
to
start
thinking

should

NEIL
deGRASSE
TYSON:
We're
talking
challenges
our

And
you
go
back
to
Copernicus,
where
he
restored
the
Sun
in
the
center
of
the
known
universe,
displacing
Earth.
And
you
get
to
Darwinian
evolution,
and
you
find
out
we're
not
we're
just
one
among
other
lifeforms.
And
now
we
learn
that
we're
not
even
special
in
the
entire
universe
There
he
is.
An
alien
among
us.
We're
not
alone.
CHARLIE

Are
you,
personally
comfortable
saying
"Superman
could
have
saved
your
child,
"but
on
principle,
I'm
not
saying
he
shouldn't
act.
I'm
saying
he
shouldn't
act
unilaterally.
What
are
we
talking
about
here,
then?
Must
there
be
a
Superman?
There
is.

MARTHA:
Hello?
CLARK:
Mom?
Clark!
What
is
it?
What's
wrong?
No.
Nothing.
I

Hi.
Hi.
How
come
Dad
never
left
Kansas?

Well,
he
just...

"What
do
I
need
to
travel
for?
"I'm
already
there."
Just
wish
it
was
more
simple.
My

Nothing
was

Hmm!
I've

could

Nobody

Maybe

Just
a

Yeah?
Well,
what
the

To

Your

He
made

half

My

I
can't
even
piss

Let
me
face
him.
You'll
take
care
of
it?
Good.

What?


Wrong
room,
miss.
Secretary
Swanwick,
you
haven't
been
Miss
Lane,
if
you'd
like
an
interview,
Major
Farris
is
just
outside
that
door.
You're
treating
me
like
a
stranger?
I'm
treating
you
like
a
reporter.
All
right.
Is
the
US
providing
to
rebels
in
Africa?
You
know,
with
balls
like
yours,
you
belong
in
here.
What's
your
source
on
this?
No,
not
tin.
But
it's
metal.
Fired
in
the
Superman
incident.
Experts
at
the
Pentagon
can't
ID
it.
Here's
the
truth.
A
reporter
got
greedy
for
a
scoop
Superman
acted
like
some
rogue
combatant
to
rescue
her,
and
people
died.
Don't
invent
a
conspiracy
Or
yours.
-
Major.
PERRY:
So.
I
logged
into
your
Dropbox
to
find
copy.
There's
copy
all
right.
But
nothing
about
football.
Nothing
about
the
friends
just
the
goddamn
Gotham
Bat
thing
I
told
you
not
to
pursue.
If
the
police
won't
help,
You
don't
get
to
decide
When
the
Planet
was
founded,
And
so
could
you
if
it
was
1938,
WPA
ain't
hiring
no
more.
Not
in
here,
not
out
there.
Nobody
cares
about
Clark
Kent
JON
STEWART:
So
apparently
Superman
doesn't
want
us
to
think
of
him
And
really,
why
would
we?
Aside
from
the
red
and
blue
costume.
And,
I
don't
know,
the
fact
that
he
has
one-third
of
the
USA's
I
assume
the
only
reason
he's
not
wearing
the
Declaration
of

thinks
it's

on-the-nose.

MANAGER:
What
is
going
on
back
here?
Guys,
come
on.
Let's
go.
Get
yourselves
together
and
get
out
there.
Get
those
glasses
on
those
trays.
We
got
thirsty
people
out
there.
I
wonder,
would
you
excuse
us?
-
There's
something
I'd
like
to
show
you.
Now
some
scholars
insist
But
I
believe
it's
the
action
perfectly
in
keeping
with
a
king
For
me,
it's
the
culmination
And
I
can't
believe
it,
It's
the
Sword
of
Alexander.
It's
the
blade
that
cut
the
Gordian
knot.
It's
a
triumph.
DIANA:
Yes.
JAMES
HARMON:
Enjoy.
It's
a
fake.
The
real
one
was
sold
And
now
it
hangs...
Over
the
bed
of
the
Sultan
of
Hajar.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me,
miss.
The
other
night
you
took
something
Stealing's
not
polite.
Is
it
stealing
if
you
steal
Who
are
you?
Someone
interested
Is
that
right?
I
believe
Mr.
Luthor
has
a
photograph
Did
you
get
it?
As
it
happens,
no,
I
didn't.
The
data
you
copied

You
know,
I

you're

I'm

I'm
the

You
don't
know
me,
but
I've
known
a
few
women
like
you.
I
don't

you've
ever
You
know,
it's
true
what
Born
with
no
natural
I
didn't
steal
your
drive.
I
borrowed
it.
You'll
find
it
in
the
glove
Mr.
Wayne.


Did
you
get
it?
The
rock?
Yeah,
we
got
it.

I'm
sorry.

Get
down!
Get
down
now!
No!










She
was
my
world.
And
you
took
her
from
me.

Bruce!
Listen
to
me
now!
It's
Lois!
It's
Lois
Lane!
She's
the
key!
Am
I

I'm

You're

You've

right
about
him!
Fear
him!
Fear
him!
Find
us,
Bruce!
You
have
to
find
us!

BRUCE:
The
White
Portuguese
is
not
a
man.
It's
a
ship.
Master
Wayne,
since
the
age
of
seven
you
have
been
to
the
art
of
deception
as
Mozart
to
the
harpsichord.
But
you've
never
been
The
White
Portuguese
is
not
What
is
it
carrying?
It's
a
weapon.
It's
a
rock.
A
mineral
capable
of
weakening
The
first
sample
big
enough
turned
up
in
the
Indian
Ocean
It
is
now
aboard
the
White
Portuguese
being
delivered
to
Lex
Luthor.
Who
I
am
going
to
steal
it
from.
To
keep
it
out
of
Luthor's
hands.
To
destroy
it.
No.
You're
gonna
go
to
war?
That
son
of
a
bitch
brought
Jesus,
Alfred.
Count
the
dead.
What's
next?
Millions?
He
has
the
power
to
wipe
out
and
if
we
believe
there's
even
we
have
to
take
it
And
we
have
to
destroy
him.
But
he
is
not
our
enemy.
Not
today.
20
years
in
Gotham,
Alfred.
We've
seen
what
promises
are
worth.
How
many
good
guys
are
left.
How
many
stayed
that
way.
14
hours.
My
name
is
Clark
Kent.
I'm
trying
to
find
out
a
Santos.
I
can't
give
out
that
information.
Mommy!
Mrs.
Santos?
May
I
ask
you
a
few
questions?
He
wasn't
my
husband.
But
he
was
a
father.
He
was
that,
too.
They
took
him
out
of
Gotham
Central.
They
moved
him
to
Metropolis.
But
inside
they
know.
They
know
the
mark
all
over.
Bat's
the
judge.
One
man
decides
who
lives.
-
How
is
that
justice?
-
Help
me
change
it.
A
man
like
that,
words
don't
stop
him.
You
know
stops
him?
A
fist.

PERRY:
Kent,
I
want
Kent!
Where
does
he
go?
I
don't...
I
don't
know.
Clicks
his
heels
three
times,
Son
of
a...


WORKER:
Turn
it!
Turn
it!

Move
out!

Go,
go,
go,
go!

No!

-


Where
is
he?



-



Next
time
they
shine
don't
go
to
it.
The
Bat
is
dead.
Bury
it.
Consider
this
mercy.
BRUCE:
Tell
me.
Do
you
bleed?
You
will.


I
don't
have
a
halo
over
me,
I
went
into
the
desert,
people
died.
It
keeps
me
awake.
It
should.
If
you
think
that
Superman
is
a
murderer,
then
throw
it
away.
But
I
don't
believe
you
think
that.
FINCH:
How
do
we
determine
In
a
democracy,
good
is
a
conversation,
-
not
a
unilateral
decision.
So
I
urge
Superman
to
come
to
this
Hill
of
the
People
tomorrow
to
see
those
who
have
suffered.
The
world
needs
to
know
And
to
know
what
he
stands
for.
How
far
will
he
take
his
power?
Does
he
act
by
our
will
or
by
his
own?
MARTHA:
People
hate
But
they
see
what
you
do,
You're
not
a
killer,
a
threat.
I
never
wanted
this
world
to
have
you.

Be
their
hero,
Clark.
Be
their
monument.
Be
their
angel.
Or
be
none
of
it.
You
don't
owe
this
world
a
thing.
You
never
did.

I

was

Somebody
wanted
Superman
to
look
guilty.

The
bullet?
The

was
developed
What
company?
LexCorp.
Lex
Luthor?
He
also
had
private

contractors
Go

Not
a

It's

I
happen
to

It
doesn't
make

said
that

was

how
could

know
In

middle
of
the
desert.
Thank
you.

The

Quick
question
for
you.
You're

What
will
you
tell

KEEFE:
I've
come
here
This
is
flesh
and
blood.
He
has
delivered
a
war
here.
And
this...
This
is
what
war
looks
like.
There
are
plenty
of
people,
He
is
not
a
hero.
Grace,
can
you
get
Greg
up
here,
please?
Right
now.
An
anonymous
source
can
verify
everything
I
told
you
about
what
-
An
anonymous
source?
Luthor
engineered
the
desert.
It
was
an
ambush
for
Superman.
Trust
your
reporter.
Think
Watergate.
Yeah,
and
you
need
to
think
litigate.
If
you're
wrong,
Luthor
will
You
need
proof.
No.
It
needs
to
run
now.
Before
the
hearing.
If
Superman
knows,
I
am
not
going
to
risk
the
paper
so
that
you
can
pass
notes
in
class
to
the
man
that
rescued
you.
McGRAW:
He
paid
her?

Not
only
paid
her.
Gave
her
a
script
to
learn.
Her
parents
are
alive

home.
But
the

got
a
conscience.
He's

Hi,

Don't
go

I
want
to
talk
to

Uh,

what?
Mercy,
you
go
in
and
make
sure
So
what
you
been
up
to?
I'm
just
here
to
tell
my
story.
That
I
was
willing
to
finance
but
a
certain
junior
senator
from
Kentucky
decided
to
block
it.
Yes,
the

of
the
committee

why
hasn't

horrific

Why
haven't
I
seen
this?
GREG:
I'm
sorry.
BASH:
And
there
he
is.
Superman
is
here.
He
is
actually
This
is
really
a
historic
moment.
Now
we
expect
that
Superman
will
give
some
kind
of
a
statement
to
the
Senate,
to
the
American
people,
He's
here.
He
came.
-
He's
above
the
Capitol.
You
are
gonna

Do

It's
that

Oh,

Rudy,
she's
good
to

Get
out!

Get

Get

GREG:
Another

Let
me

"And
so
we
are
left
to

"if
Superman

he
then
complicit
Still
no

JENNY:
"His

No.
DANA

There
are
still
so
many
Chief
among
them,
whether
Superman
was
involved
I
mean,
here's
an
individual
yet
did
nothing
to
stop
the
bomber
It
just
doesn't
add
up
for
investigators.
CROWD:

Burn
him,
burn
him,
burn
him.

For
20
American,
he
didn't
see
you.
Same
for
me.

REPORTER:
Now
one
FBI
official
told
me
they
found
quote,
"A
jackpot
of
bomb-making
materials
What
they
need
to
determine
now
is
whether
he
had
any
help
in
the
planning
And
they
haven
't
ruled
out
the
idea
Now,
my
sources
are
telling
me
they
are
getting
a
barrage
of
anonymous
with
all
roads
in
this
investigation

All
right,
Lois.
You
gotta
go.
He
didn't
know
he
was
gonna
die.
He
just
bought
groceries.
The
wheelchair
and
were
made
from
the
same
metal.

But,

Creates
a

What
do
you
mean?
The
inside
of
the
chair
You
couldn't
stop
it.

You
couldn't
see
it.
Something,
isn't
it?
We
men
of
Kansas
live
on
a
pancake,
All
downhill
from
here,
Farm
at
the
bottom
of
the
world.
I
remember
one
season
the
water
came
bad.
I
couldn't
have
been
12.
Dad
had
out
the
shovels

But
we
managed
to
stop
the
water.
We
saved
the
farm.
Your
grandma
baked
me
a
cake.
Later
that
day
we
found
out
We
sent
it
upstream.
The
whole
Lang
farm
washed
away.
While
I
ate
my
hero
cake,
I
used
to
hear
them
wailing
in
my
sleep.
Did
the
nightmares
ever
stop?
Yeah.
When
I
met
your
mother.
She
gave
me
faith
that
She
was
my
world.
I
miss
you,
son.
I
miss
you
too,
Dad.
ALFRED:
You
know
you
can't
win
this.
It's
suicide.
I'm
older
now
than
my
father
ever
was.
This
may
be
the
only
thing
20
years
of
fighting
criminals
Criminals
are
like
weeds,
Alfred.
Pull
one
up,
another
grows
in
its
place.
This
is
about
the
future
of
the
world.
This
is
my
legacy.
My
father
sat
me
down
right
here.
Told
me
what
Wayne
Manor
was
built
on.
Railroads,
real
estates,
and
oil.
The
first
generation
made
their
fortune
Pelts
and
skins.
They
were
hunters.
So
falls
the
house
of
Wayne.
NANCY
GRACE:
We
gotta
wait
for
more
where
is
he?
If
Superman
was
not
involved,
if
he's
got
nothing
to
hide,
then
why
hasn
't
he
been

The
night
is
here.
Excuse
me.
Don't
I
know...


Plain
Lo
in
the
morning.
Lola
in

Lois

Mmm.
Come
see
the
view.
Um...

Mmm-mmm.
Now
the
secret
to
the
height
It's
light
metals
Hmm.
And
you
know
something
don't
you,
Miss
Lane?
I've
proven
what
you've
done.
Wow,
you're
feisty.
Unfortunately,
that
will
blow
away.
Like
sand
in
the
desert.
You're
psychotic.
That
is
a
three-syllable
word
Hmm.
Next
category:
circles.
Round
and
round

Wrong
category,
boy.
Yes,
Euclid's
triangle
inequality.
The
shortest
distance
is
a
straight
path.
And
I
believe
is
a
pretty
little
road...

Mmm.
Called
Lois
Lane.



You
came
back.
You
came
back.
Boy,
do
we
have
problems
up
here!



The
problem
of...
Of
evil
in
the
world.
Uh,
the
problem
of
absolute
virtue.
I'll
take
you
in
without
breaking
you.
Which
is
more
than
you
deserve.
The
problem
of
you
You
above
all.
Ah,
because
that's
what
God
is.
Horus.
Apollo.
Jehovah.
Kal-El.
Clark
Joseph
Kent.
See,
what
we
call
God
Because
God
is
tribal.
God
takes
sides.
No
man
in
the
sky
intervened
to
deliver
me
from
I
figured
out
way
back,
if
God
is
all-powerful,
And
if
he
is
all-good,
And
neither
can
you
be.
They
need
to
see
the
fraud
you
are.
With
their
eyes.
The
blood
on
your
hands.
What
have
you
done?
Hmm.
And
tonight,
they
will.
Yes.
Because
you,
my
friend,
Across
the
bay.
Ripe
fruit,
his
hate.
Two
years
growing.
But
it
did
not
take
much
Little
red
notes,
big
bang.
You
let
your
family
die!
And
now
you
will
fly
to
him.
To
the
death.
Black
and
blue.
Fight
Night!
The
greatest
gladiator
match
-
God
versus
man.
Day
versus
night.
Son
of
Krypton
versus
Bat
of
Gotham.
You
think
I'll
fight
him
for
you?
Hmm,
yes,
I
do.
I
think
you
will
fight-fight-fight
She's
safe
on
the
ground.
How
about
you?
Close,
but
I
am
not
talking
about
Lois.
No.
Every
boy's
special
lady
is
his
mother.

Martha,
Martha,
Martha.
Hmm.
Why,
the
mother
of
a
flying
demon
The
punishment
for
witches,
what
is
that?
That's
right.
Death
by
fire.
Mmm.


Where
is
she?
I
don't
know!
Uh-uh-uh!
If
you
kill
me,
Martha
dies.
And
if
you
fly
away,
mmm,
But
if
you
kill
the
Bat...
Martha
lives.
There
we
go.
There
we
go.
Hmm.
And
now
God
bends
to
my
will.

Ooh,
now

For
the

Yes,
the

To

Martha,

Ah.

you

Now
it's

Go
