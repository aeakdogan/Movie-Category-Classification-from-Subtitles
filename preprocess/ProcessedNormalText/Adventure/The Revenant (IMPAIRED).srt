It's
okay,
son...
I
know
you
want
this
to
be
over.
I'm
right
here.
I
will
be
right
here...
But,
you
don't
give
up.
You
hear
me?
As
long
as
you
can
still
You
breathe...
keep
breathing.

GLASS:
Hawk.

Ah,
shit.
Goddamn
sumbitches.
The
sumbitch

shit
for
brains.

You

Coulter?
TRAPPER:
Nope.
Listen

When
them
plews
is
cleaned,
I
want
you
to
hoop
'em
up
real
tight.
Remember,
we're
not

We're
going
30-pelt
bales!
HENRY:
Fitzgerald!
Cap'n.
Where
are
we
with
the
haul?
I'm
thinking,
whatever
it
is
I
hope
it
don't
need
another
shot.
Make
sure
we're
ready
to
head
out
by
dawn.
Been
done
by
this
morning.
I'd
have
liked
to
be
out
by
how,
We're
only
a
few
days
from
the
fort.
We're
trapped
out.
All
we
have
to
worry
about
Well,
you,
uh,
seen
Coulter?

JIM:
Hey,
we
took
down
an
elk.
A
big
one.
We
need
help
to
haul
the
meat
back.
Let
me
know
when
it's
on
the
spit.
I'll
help
you
with
it
then.
Come
on,
I
need
your
help.
We
needed
help
when
we
were
I
been
eating
this
damn
I'm
starting
to
miss
my
wife's
cooking.
I'm
starting
to
miss
your
wife.
Shut
up.
COULTER:
Help!
Help.

TRAPPER
1:
Is
that
Coulter?
You
go
get
the
Captain.
STUBBY
BILL:
Jesus
Christ.
TRAPPER
2:
Anybody
see
them?
TRAPPER
3:
Stay
quiet.
TRAPPER
4:
Watch
the
ridge.



What
was
that?
Pa?
Let's
go.


-

They
got
Thomas.
I
can't
see
'em.
I
can't
see
'em.
HENRY:
Get
down!
We're
surrounded!
They're
everywhere!
HENRY:
Stay
here!
Stay
here!

Paul,
no!

They
want
us
out
in
the
open.
Nobody
move!
Stay
where
you
are!
They
want
the
pelts.
We
got
to
get
on
that
boat


Get
to
the
boat!
To
the
boat,
son!
Move!
Move,
move!

Leave
the
furs!



Hawk!
Hawk!
Hawk!



Grab
some
pelts!
Come
on,
grab
the
pelts!

Grab
the
pelts!
Grab
the
pelts!
DAVE:
Give
this
to
my
little
girl.
You're
coming
with
us.
I'll
get
help.
GLASS:
Leave
the
furs!
Leave
the
pelts!
Willman!
Lean
on
me.
Just
keep
going.

Get
to
the
boat!


Fucking
savage!
Get
on
the
fucking
boat!

Help!
HENRY:
Cut
the
rope!
Cut
the
rope!
Wait
for
Amos!
No!
We
go
now!
Fire
the
cannon!
AMOS:
Don't
leave!
Wait!

My
daughter,
Powaqa,
is
not
here.
Collect
all
the
pelts
we
can
carry.
We'll
trade
pelts
with
the
French
HENRY:
...and
dust
becomes
flour
this
child
of
God
will
meet

HENRY:
You
ready?
Hold
still.

ANDERSON:
Where
did
you
learn
that?
My
father
was
a
doctor.
Bridger!
FITZGERALD:
Captain,
we
got
a
swarm
of
tree
Tell
me
you
got
some
kind
of
plan.
Glass?
Missouri's
no
good.
Not
while
the
Ree's
running
it.
We
got
to
get
off
this
boat.
Oh,
you
want
to
get
off
the
boat?
Then
what
do
we
do,
huh?
Take
our
furs
and
sit
out
there
amongst
Only
safe
thing
to
do
is
track
That'll
add
weeks
to
the
trip.
Better
than
floating
They
got
eyes
on
you
right
now,
son.
What
I'm
saying
is
we
stay
on
the
boat.
Chart
a
course
toward
the
fort
Glass
knows
this
territory
best.
It's
his
job
to
get
us
home
safe.
-
Get
us
home
safe?
FITZGERALD:
Need
I
remind
you
It's
33
now.
They
were
my
men,
Fitzgerald.
I
know
how
many
I
lost.
We
do
like
Glass
says.
GLASS:
We
have
to
set
the
boat
loose.
If
the
Ree
are
tracking
us,
Best
course
is
to
hike
inland
to
ANDERSON:
On
foot?
It'll
be
winter
before
we
get
there.
Yeah,
unless
we
come
across
a
post,
Ain't
no
posts
that
far
over!
Captain,
losing
this
boat
The
Ree
ain't
that
stupid.
We
keep
it,
we
can
lay
it
up
Quit
acting
like
you
know
Ain't
nobody
talking
to
you.
Who'd
listen
to
you
anyway?
Can't
find
your
way
All
I'm
saying
is
Camp
Rhulen
We
can
hole
up
there.
We
walk.
Yeah,
I'm
sure
we
will.
Wish
my
dad
was
a
doctor.
Then
he
could've
bought
me
What
do
we
do,
eh?
Pray
these
pelts
ain't
rotten
HENRY:
Make
sure
to
mark
this
place.
We're
leaving
a
fortune
under
these
rocks.
Glass,
chart
a
course.
Tightest
you
can
that
FITZGERALD:
This
ain't
right.
We
all
know
these
furs
ain't
gonna
There's
no
way
we
can
haul
them
Arikara
are
all
through
the
territory.
We'll
want
our
hands
free.
We're
gonna
lose
those
pelts.
You
rather
keep
the
pelts
or
your
life?
Life?
What
life
you
talking
about?
I
just
got
living
and
the
only
way
Fuck!
Ain't
no
way
I'm
going
home
working
my
ass
off
like
a
mule...
risking
my
neck,
men
dying,
and
for
what?
Damn
near
lost
everything.
Job's
been
fucked
from
the
start!
There's
the
one
been
fucking
us.
You
wonder
how
the
Ree
when
Mr.
Glass
was
supposed
All
them
Pawnee
buddies
of
his.
Pawnee's
as
much
against
Yeah?
Well,
what
about
What
kind
of
savage
Oh,
lay
off
the
boy,
Fitz.
All
I'm
saying
is...
a
savage...
is
savage.
Hey,
Glass...
is
it
true
what
they
say
while
living
with
them
savages?
Twenty-one
dead
soldiers
But
you
and
your
boy
Kind
of
a
miracle.
HENRY:
Shut
up,
Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD:
Is
that
what
you
did?
Shot
one
of
your
own
Shut
up!
Why?
Was
he
playing
with
Did
he
kill
her?
Hey,
you
can
quit
polishing
that
rifle
I'm
working
on
it.
You
can
work
on
it
Look
at
me.
HENRY:
That's
enough!
You're
forgetting
your
place,
boy.
As
far
as
I
can
tell,
my
place
is
here
HENRY:
You
move
along,
Fitzgerald.
That's
an
order!
Listen!
There's
only
a
couple
hours
of
light
left.
We
got
to
stash
these
pelts
-
Let's
go!

I
told
you
to
be
invisible,
son.
At
least
he...
If
you
want
to
survive,
-
At
least
he
heard
me...
They
just
see
the
color
of
your
face.
You
understand?
Yes.
You
have
to
listen
to
me,
son.
You
have
to
listen.

HENRY:
Beckett!
Weston!
JONES:
Why
are
they
not
jumping?
STUBBY
BILL:
FITZGERALD:
Smart
sumbitches.
Smart.

I
ought
to
be
on
that
boat.
They
did
the
right
thing.


It's
time
to
move.
Get
up.
We're
headed
out.
I'm
coming.
It's
better
you
lay
down.
When
the
rest
of
the
men
are
ready
I'm
going
west.
You
are
my
son.

There
are
only
two
here.

Powaqa
is
not
here.

The
others
probably
took
her.
They
went
north.

We'll
pick
up
their
tracks
on
the
mountain.

HENRY:
Was
it
the
right
decision?
Leaving
the
boat?
The
Ree
own
that
river.
We
stay
east
of
the
Grand
through
Lands
are
bone
dry
up
there.
HENRY:
Except
us.
GLASS:
Except
us.
Is
it
true
what
Fitzgerald
said?
Is
that
why
you
came
out
here
Glass?
I
do
like
the
quiet.
Your
boy...
he's
seen
a
lot.
He
got
a
mother























JIM:
Mr.
Glass!
There
are
cubs
here!
We
got
cubs
here!
Christ
Almighty.
He's
down
here!
ANDERSON:
Keep
your
eyes
open.
JIM:
I
need
your
help
now!
HENRY:
Oh,
my
God.

Get
me
rags
now!
Give
me
rags
before
he
bleeds
out.
Rags.
Prepare
the
kit.
Bridger!
You
hold
that.

Easy.
Oh,
my
God.
ANDERSON:
Got
to
give
him
credit
He
shouldn't
have
shot.
The
place
is
crawling
with
tree
niggers.
HENRY:
That's
enough!
That's
enough!
We're
still
in
Ree
territory.
He's
one
of
our
own
men.

Scout
a
circle
around
us.
North
and
west.
Take
those
two
with
you.
Bill,
Fryman,
you
take
south
and
east.
Watch
for
anyone
We
have
to
stitch
him
up.
What
about
me?
Captain?
You
just
stay
here.
Hold
it
down.
JIM:
I'm
so
sorry,
Mr.
Glass.
HENRY:
Bridger,
press
down
here.
JIM:
He's
bleeding
down
here,
too.

ANDERSON:
They're
torturing
the
bastard.
The
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
Unless
he
has
a
chance
of
pulling
through.

Pulling
through?
You
saw
what
that
grizz
did
to
him.
-
He'll
be
dead
inside
an
hour.
Yeah,
we
all
will
be
if
he
don't
quit
Toward
you
and
twist
it
into
place.
-
Pa.
Go!
Now!
He
passed
out.
I'll
take
advantage
Water.
Bridger,
tell
the
others
-
we'll
camp
here
tonight.
I'm
right
here.
I'll
be
right
here...


Toussaint,
he's
here.
I
thought
he
wouldn't
make
it.
I'm
glad
you
made
it
here.
We
need
horses
and
rifles.
We
bring
you
many
pelts.
No
horses...
just
what
we
agreed.
Take
all
the
pelts
you
want.
We
need
horses
and
rifles.
I
need
a
woman
with
big
tits...
Who
can
cook.
We
can't
give
you
any
horses.
What's
he
saying?
I
don't
know,
something
about
horses.
Bring
us
something
to
drink...
some
whisky.
Tell
him
to
stop
asking
about
the
horses.
Always
good
doing
business
with
you.
Horses.
No
horses.
All
we
can
trade
are
guns
and
ammunition.
Tell
him
if
he
asks
about
horses
again,
Where
did
you
get
these?
The
Americans?
They're
already
branded.
I'll
only
be
able
to
get
half
price
for
them.
Get
him
away
from
there.
I
said
no
horses.
We'll
take
these
three
horses.
I'm
not
going
to
say
it
again.
They
aren't
part
of
the
deal.
Now
tell
your
man
to
step
away.
We
had
an
agreement,
you
have
to
honor
it.

You
stand
there
I
told
you
he
speaks
French.
Those
pelts
are
stolen.
You
all
have
stolen
everything
from
us.
Everything!
The
land.
The
animals.
Two
white
men
snuck
into
our
village,
We
leave
you
these
pelts
I
take
your
horses
to
find
my
daughter.
You
are
free
to
try
and
stop
me.
Business
is
business.
Prepare
five
horses
for
them.
HENRY:
I
want
everybody
up
Carrying
Glass
will
be
hard...
so
we
need
to
get
ahead
We'll
divide
into
two
groups.
Fitzgerald,
Jones,
Fryman,
you
take
the
east
side
of
the
river.
Anderson,
you
scout
up
front.
That
claw
don't
belong
to
you.
It
ain't
for
me.



Stop!


HENRY:
Don't
let
him
down!
ANDERSON:
Watch
it.
-
JONES:
How
we
gonna
make
it
up
this?
ANDERSON:
It's
killing
us,
Captain!

HENRY:
Lift
it,
Bridger!
FITZGERALD:
Goddamn
it,
keep
it
steady.
JIM:
Lift
it
up
higher.
HAWK:
I
am.
HENRY:
And
heave!

JONES:
I'll
go
up
and
pull.


My
foot!
Enough
of
this
shit!
We'll
never
make
it
across
-
He's
burning
up.

Cap'n,
you
ain't
doing
us
by
letting
him
go
on
suffering
like
this.
Captain,
it's
all
the
same
up
here.
We're
gonna
have
to
go
back.

Glass.
Hugh.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
Lay
that
rag
over
his
eyes,
Mr.
Bridger.
HAWK:
What?
-
HENRY:
Lay
the
rag
over
his
eyes.
HENRY:
I'm
sorry,
Hugh.
JIM:
Sir,
I
can't
do
that.
HAWK:
How
do
we
get
back
without
him?
Only
he
knows
the
way.
-
HENRY:
Lay
the
rag
over
his
eyes.
Wait!
How
do
we
get
back...

HENRY:
Lay
it
over
his
eyes!
Step
back.
HAWK:
Bridger,
stop!
Bridger,
Henry.
Henry!
Henry,
please.
Captain.
Captain.
Please.
Please
leave...


There's
a
$70
bonus
from
the
Rocky
that
stay
with
Glass
to
see
this
through.
HAWK:
I'll
stay!
Me,
too.
Money
or
not,
I'll
stay.
I'll
need
a
third.
Sorry,
Captain.
I
have
a
family.
I'm
not
crazy.
Captain,
three
men
much
less
some
boys.
Besides,
$70
ain't
gonna
buy
A
hundred,
then.
This
man
is
the
only
reason
We
were
45
men
when
this
started.
Now
we're
ten.
Almost
nine.
HAWK:
JIM:
Mine,
too.
He
can
have
my
share
also.
All
right.
If
Mr.
Bridger
feels
the
same
way,
-
You?
You
already
lost
my
share
of
the
pelts
by
some
other
means.
Sticking
around
for
another
day
or
two
$300...
at
least
I
get
to
Glass
is
to
be
cared
Yeah.
You
have
my
word.
I
understand.
HENRY:
You
boys
get
him
down
off
this
Fitzgerald.
Glass
is
to
be
cared
for
And
a
proper
burial
when
it's
time.
He's
earned
it.
I
understand.
You
hurt
yourself?
ANDERSON:
I'll
be
fine.


Can
you
hear
that
wind,
father?
Remember
what
mother
used
to
say
The
wind
cannot
defeat
You
are
still
breathing...
I
miss
her
so
much.


I
will
be
right
here...
I'm
right
here.
As
long
as
you
can
still
You
breathe.
Keep
breathing.

When
there
is
a
storm...
And
you
stand
in
front
of
a
tree...

If
you
look
at
its
branches,
But
if
you
watch
the
trunk,


FITZGERALD:
Three
hundred
bucks
Go
down
to
Texas,
find
me
and
start
pissing
in
the
wind.
Get
me
the
hell
out
of
this

Ree
done
that
to
you?
I'm
just
asking.
Yeah,
they
done
it.
They
took
their
sweet
time
with
it.
At
the
start,
I
didn't
feel
nothing.
I
just
heard
the
sound...
of
the
knife
scraping
them
all
laughing
and
whooping
Then
the
blood
came.
It
was
cold.
It
started
in
my
eyes,
and...
breathing
it
in.
Choking
on
it.
That's
when
I
felt
it.
Yeah,
felt
all
of
it.
I
got
my
head
turned
inside
out.
JIM:
Jesus.
Them
Indians
down
Texas
way...
they
may
rob
you,
but
they
JIM:
When
was
it?
Goddamn
it,
will
you
quit
that
noise
now,
will
you?
Quit
it.
FITZGERALD:
I'm
falling
further
back
from
Henry
and
the
boys
Got
to
get
up
the
damn
mountain,
If
you
ready
to
take
the
sacrament...
I
can
do
that
for
you.
What
you
holding
to,
Glass?
You
know...
it
would
be
better...
if
you
were
to
take
that
for
all
of
us.
Now
you
hung
tough.
And
that's
something.
I'm
begging
you.
Them
Ree
are
so
close
I
can
smell
'em.
You
can
smell
'em,
too.
You
got
to
think
of
your
boy.
All
right?
'Cause
you're
gonna
kill
him.
You'll
kill
us
all.

I
can
muzzle
you
if
you
like.
Take
away
this
suffering
quick
and
easy.
No
one
ever
has
to
know
that
you
give
up.
All
you
have
to
do
is
blink

Save
your
boy
and
blink.
You
just
have
to
blink.
Yeah.
There
it
is.
You'd
best
hope
the
good
Lord'll
Maybe
He'll
forgive
your
sins,
maybe
not.
Thus
I
do
commend
thee
to
the
Lord.

Through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
and
the
Father
Get
away!
Get
away!
You
okay?
Jim!
Jim!
Help!
HAWK:
Help!
Calm
down.
Jim!
Help!
Don't
shout!
You're
gonna
get
us
all
killed!
Keep
away!
They'll
hang
you!
They'll
hang
you!
Jim,
help!
We
have
an
understanding.
What's
fucking
wrong
with
you
people?

Shit.


JIM:
I
got
one
beaver,
Hawk.
Breathing
changed?
I
hadn't
noticed.
Damn,
he's
cold
as
ice.
Here
you
go,
Mr.
Glass.
This
will
help
you.
Keep
you
warm.
It's
all
right.
Where's
Hawk?
He
ain't
with
you?
No.
No?

I
understand,
Mr.
Glass.
It's
all
right.
FITZGERALD:
Yeah.
Sounds
like
a
good
idea.

JIM:
Hawk!
Hawk!
FITZGERALD:
Shh.
Ree.
There's
about
20
of
them
They're
headed
this
way.
Shit.
What
do
we
do?
FITZGERALD:
Run,
right
now.
What
about
Hawk?
He
ain't
our
problem
no
more.
We
can't
just
leave
him.
Either
he's
gutted
or
scalped.
And
if
he
ain't
he
can
find
us,
can't
he?
What
about
Glass?
He
ain't
our
problem.
We
made
a
promise
to
the
Captain.
A
proper
burial
when
the
time
was
needed.
He
needs
that
rifle!
He
couldn't
do
nothing
with
it
We
can't
do
this.
We
got
no
fucking
choice.
JIM:
No,
we
can't.
Look
at
him.
All
right,
shit,
then,
buddy.
Get
him
up.
You
want
to
take
him?

Come
on
now!
JIM:
Easy.
Slowly,
Fitz.
Easy
with
him.

FITZGERALD:
Just
get
your
shit.
-
Get
your
shit!
Shut
up.
Shut
up!
JIM:
Hold
up!

Fitz.
What
are
you
doing?
What
does
it
look
like?
Proper
burial.
Like
you
wanted.
JIM:
No,
not
like
this.
FITZGERALD:
Why
not?
He's
alive,
Fitz.
He's
alive.
So
shoot
him.

I
have
to
go.
I
have
to
go.
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Glass.
I'm
sorry.
-
I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry.


MURPHY:
Captain!
This
way!
There's
a
path
down
here!
ANDERSON:
There
ain't
shit
down
there!
We
got
to
climb
over!
JONES:
Glass
said
to
stay
east!
ANDERSON:
Glass
can
go
to
hell!
HENRY:
What's
the
map
say?
Keep
climbing.
We
climb,
Captain.
We
keep
climbing.
Till
we
reach
Old
Gabe.
We
climb.
We
got
to
wait
for
Murph.
ANDERSON:
Yeah.
You
wait
for
him.
Captain?
Sir...
Murphy
says
there's
a
way
down
there.
Who
we
following?
ANDERSON:
You
follow
who
you
want!
I'm
going
up!
Stubby,
keep
going
up!
JONES:
Murph!
Come
here!










I'm
not
leaving
you,
son.
I'm
right
here.
FITZGERALD:
Fire's
done.
I
can't
even
feel
my
feet.
Didn't
we
put
enough
distance
A
dozen
Ree
can
make
-
Twenty.
You
said
you
saw
twenty
Ree.
Yeah?
What
you
talking
about?
-
You
woke
me
up.
You
said
you
saw
twenty
Ree
by
the
creek.
Well,
yeah,
twenty,
a
dozen...
I
wasn't
gonna
hang
around
As
a
matter
of
fact...
what
was
you
doing
down
I'd
already
brought
up
plenty
of
water.
Hey!
Answer
me,
Fitzgerald.
Don't
question
me
Answer
me
or
I'll
blow
your
head
off.
You
got
a
short-term
memory,
boy.
Your
ass
would
be
floating
around
You
want
to
ask
questions?
What
you
want
to
ask?
Hmm?
You
want
to
know
why
you
left
Or
why
you
left
your
little
boyfriend
You
want
to
know
if
he's
still
alive?
I'll
tell
you
why.
It's
'cause
you
was
scared
shitless.
You're
scared
now.
The
Ree.
What
of
them?
Tell
me,
did
you
see
'em?
-
Put
your
rifle
down.
No.
Not
a
single
one.
You
fucking
lied
to
me?
You
lied
to
me!


I
had
to
scare
some
sense
into
you,
boy.
Glass
was
dead.
Hawk
we
don't
know
about.
No
point
in
either
of
us
The
way
I
see
it,
I
ought
to
be
God
to
you.
And
God
giveth...
and
God
taketh
away.
-

Lucky
fucker.
Next
time
you
want
to
shoot
somebody...
you
might
want
to
use
powder,
Come
on.
Let's
git.
Grab
your
shit.






Fresh
blood.
This
could
be
Powaqa.
A
dead
boy.
A
Pawnee
boy.
Let's
go.

























Who
did
this?
FITZGERALD:
I
don't
know.
Could
be
Captain
Leavenworth's
boys.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Put
some
eyes
on
the
back
These
Injuns
ain't
never
Look
at
'em,
huh?
They're
always
stealing
our
shit.




FITZGERALD:
We
got
horses
over
here!
Hey,
Bridger.
We
got
horses!
JIM:
What
you
want
to
do
about
these
pigs?
FITZGERALD:
The
Lord's
on
our
side,
kid.
FITZGERALD:
You
all
right
there,
kid?
Your
head
in
the
right
place?
I
guess.
I
can't
help
thinking
about
Ain't

place
to
wonder.

He
joined

Pretty

He
done

Should
have
been
a

Somehow
that
night
he
lost
his
buddies.
And
to
top
it
off,
them
Comanches
So
he
was
starving
and
delirious...
and
he
crawls
up
into
this
mott,
this...
group
of
trees
out
just
sticking
up
in
this
ocean
of
scrub...
and
he
found
religion.
At
that
moment,
he
told
me...
he
found
God.
Uh-huh.
And
it
turns
out
that
God...
He's
a
squirrel.
Yeah.
A
big,
old
meaty
one.
"I
found
God,"
he
used
to
say.
"And
while
sitting
there
"and
sublimity
of
mercy..."
"I
shot
and
ate
that
son
of
a
bitch."
Mmm.
Yeah.
You
might
want
to























I'm
injured.
What
happened
to
you?
A
bear.
A
bear.
Grizzly.
Grizzly.
My
men...
left
me
for
dead.
Killed
my
son.
I
lost
my
family
too.
Sioux
killed
my
people.
I'm
going
south
to
find
more
Pawnee.
My
heart
bleeds...
But
revenge
is
in
the
creator's
hands.
You
will
ride
with
me...



Your
body
is
rotten.
Need
to
heal.
You
could
die.

FITZGERALD:
Yeah!
There
she
is.
We
did
it.
You
ought
to
be
proud
of
yourself,
boy.
Yeah.
We
followed
orders.
We
just
skipped
the
funeral
part.
Don't
go
down
there
'Cause
sure
as
night'll
come
they'll
We
did
what
we
had
to
do.



FITZGERALD:
We
had
the
extra
a
little
deeper,
lay
rocks
on
top
It
was
done
right
and
all.
Sir,
can
we...
The
truth
is
that...

when
Hawk
disappeared,
And
I
was
ready
to
get,
to
move
on
out.
Yeah,
but,
Bridger
here
argued
to
stay.
He
argued
to
stay...
so
he
could
at
least
to
put
on
top
of
Glass's
grave,
and
that's
what
he
did.
I'm
glad
you
pulled
He
more
than
pulled
his
weight,
Captain.
This
man
here,
he
was
my
partner.
Am
I
to
assume
that
the
agreed
Uh,
fortunately
for
me,
it
did
not.
HENRY:
Mmm-hmm.

Thank
you...
for
your
courage,
honor,
and
service.
Deal
or
no
deal,
Mr.
Bridger,
Thank
you.

Kid's
been
beating
himself
up
We
all
saw
the
shape
Glass
was
in.
There
was
no
more
to
be
done.
Right?
FITZGERALD:
Yeah.
We
all
saw
him.









When
there
is
a
storm...
And
you
stand
in
front
of
a
tree...
If
you
look
at
its
branches,

But
if
you
watch
the
trunk,










There
are
traces
of
a
camp...
There
are
traces
of
a
camp...

Where?
Entering
the
moon
forest.
Maybe
from
two
days
ago.
Tell
the
others.
Let's
move
quickly,



Bring
me
the
girl...
Those
five
horses
weren't
for
free.









-

Don't
make
a
sound.

I
will
get
a
horse.

I'll
cut
off
your
balls.

Where
is
Toussaint?
Come
here...





-
FITZGERALD:
May
I
join
you?
Yeah?
Yes.
I
was
wondering
when
we
might
'Cause
them
pelts
we
collected
are
still
out
there,
you
know...
under
a
couple
foot
of
dirt
and
snow.
But
that
ain't
my
fault.
I'm
waiting
for
Captain
Leavenworth
Then
we'll
have
enough
men...
to
shoot
some
civilization
into
those
All
right.
All
right.
When's
that
supposed
to
happen?
I
don't
know.
But
until
then,
nobody
gets
paid.
Listen
here,
all
right?
I
was
hired
to
trap
'em.
The
way
I
see
it,
now
you,
you
got
a
safe.
It's
probably
full
of
money.
You
signed
a
contract
to
protect
your
boss
and
your
boss's
property.
And
that
safe
isn't
full
anymore.
It's
short
about
$300.
What
the
hell
is
that
supposed
to
mean?
It
means,
according
to
my
records...
you
purchased
more
goods
on
the
expedition
than
what
you
are
owed
by
the
company.
Now,
Happy
New
Year,
Fitzgerald.















GUARD:
Fryman!
White
man
at
the
gate!

Speak
English.
I
have
no
weapon.
-

Get
the
Captain!
HENRY:
Where
are
your
men?
All
dead.
Who
was
he?
I
don't
know.
Something
to
eat,
please?
Food
comes
at
a
price.
I
have
no
money.
Then
you
don't
eat.
Give
back
some
of
them
stolen
pelts
-
Not
now,
Jones.
Silver.
How
is
this?
Silver.
This
all
you
got?
We
was
nine.
My
friend,
he
die
in
the
snow.
And
the
other
was...
kill
by
wolf.
I
see
it.
By
wolf,
yeah,
kill.
Where'd
you
get
this?
Canteen.
He
drop
it.
Who?
Who?
I
don't
know.
I
don't
see.
It
could
be
Hawk.
Yeah,
could
be.
JONES:
That
half-breed
runt
-
Maybe
it
was
Weston.
How
far
from
here?

Thirty
mile.
Northwest,
near
the
Yellowstone.
The
Yellowstone!
Get
the
horses
saddled.
Ten
dollars
a
man.
Anderson,
you
stay
here.
ANDERSON:
Yes,
sir.
I'll
get
you
a
drink.

HENRY:
When
we
get
to
the
Yellowstone,
HENRY:
Hawk!
JIM:
Hawk,
you
out
there?

-
Whoa!
Whoa!
HENRY:
Keep
your
guard
up!
Eyes
in
front!
Who
are
you?
FRYMAN:
Beckett?
Is
that
you?

HENRY:
Glass?
Glass!
Jesus
Christ!
Jesus
Christ,
what
happened?
Where
is
he?

HENRY:
Jones,
take
him.
Go.
I'm
riding
ahead.
Bill,
take
Bridger.
Take
Bridger!
Have
you
seen
Fitzgerald?
No,
sir.
Get
up.
Get
up!
-
You
seen
Fitzgerald?
Fitzgerald?
-
Whoa,
easy.
-
Who?
I
have
no
idea.
Tell
me
or
I'll
take
your
head
off.
I
swear
to
God...

Tell
me.
Tell
me!
Texas!
He
said
he
was
going
to
Texas.
Then
he
started
talking
about
property.
"A
decent
piece
of
land."
He's
heading
for
Texas.
That's
all
I
know.
Stay
here.
Fitzgerald!
Fitzgerald!



Goddamn
it!
Goddamn
it!
GUARD:
Jones!
Get
the
Captain!
Fryman!
JONES:
Open
the
gate!
GUARD:
Open
it
up!
JONES:
Murphy,
get
the
Captain.
Get
him
to
the
doctor.
Now!
You
said
he
was
dead!
I
thought
he
was,
I
swear!

JIM:
He
lied
to
me!
HENRY:
You're
a
liar.
You
left
him
out
there!
Say
the
Lord's
Prayer.
Say
the
Lord's
Prayer!
Our
Father,
Who
art
in
heaven.
Shut
up!
Shut
up!
From
here
out,
you're
a
prisoner
Take
him
to
the
cage!
Take
him
I
thought
he
was
gonna
die!
Fitz
lied
to
me!
I
couldn't
help
him!
Glass!
Fitz
lied
to
me!



How
is
he?
DOCTOR:
He
needs
to
rest.
I'll
be
back
to
check
up
on
him.
GLASS:
He
ran
off,
didn't
he?
Bridger's
telling
the
truth.
How's
that?
Fitzgerald
lied
to
him.
He
wasn't
there
when
Fitzgerald
Is
that
what
happened?
He
killed
Hawk.
I
need
a
horse
and
gun.
No,
you
need
to
rest
and
eat.
No.
You'll
never
find
him
without
me.
If
we
wait
till
morning
he'll
get
away.
No,
he
won't.
He's
afraid.
He
knows
how
far
I
came
for
him.
Same
as
that
elk.
When
they
get
afraid,
I
got
him
trapped.
How
can
you
be
so
sure?
'Cause
he
has
everything
to
lose.
All
I
had
was
that
boy.
And
he
took
him
away
from
me.
I
can't
let
you
go
back
out
there.
Not
again.
I
ain't
afraid
to
die
anymore.
I
done
it
already.
I'm
going
with
you.




GLASS:
That's
his
horse,
all
right.
No
way
he
could've
ridden
him
HENRY:
How
far
ahead?
Half
a
day
at
the
most.
Could
be
Ree.
If
they
aren't
his,
we
lose
him.
Unless
he
reenlisted
so
he
these
tracks
right
here
are
his.

HENRY:
I
can't
remember
my
wife's
face.
Last
week,
she
was
still
with
me.
Now
she's
gone.
I
worry
I
won't
recognize
her
Is
it
true
you
killed
an
officer?
I
just
killed
the
man

Smoke.
How
close?
No
more
than
a
mile
up
that
way.
I'm
gonna
head
up
to
the
west.
Let's
see
if
we
can
find
some
tracks.
And
if
it's
the
Ree?
If
it's
the
Ree,
you
turn
right
back
around

Now,
I
wouldn't
expect
to
find
so
far
away
from
his
stove
You
lost?
I'm
here
to
take
you
back
to
Fort
Kiowa...
where
you
will
be
tried
for
murder.
Is
that
so?
I
ain't
crazy
about
your
plan.
Besides,
I
got
one
of
my
own.











We
had
a
deal,
Glass!
I
tried
to
tell
your
boy,
all
right?
I
tried
to
tell
him,
and
he
kept
on
screaming.
He
was
gonna
get
everybody
killed.
But
you
and
me...
we
had
a
deal.
You
know
what
happened
out
there.
And
on
my
soul,
the
Lord...
He
knows...
what
happened
out
there.
There
was
no
deal.
You
killed
my
boy.
Well,
maybe
you
should've
raised
a
man,


Goddamn
it.










You
came
all
this
way
Well,
you
enjoy
it,
Glass.
'Cause
there
ain't
nothing
No,
it
won't.


Revenge
is
in
God's
hands...
not
mine.
