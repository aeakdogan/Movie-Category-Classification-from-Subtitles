Did

that
your
feet
#
By
what
gravity
brings
#
Did
you
feel
you
were
tricked
#
Well,

All

#
So

There's

#
#
We
got
snow
up
on
the
mountains
#
#
We
got
rivers
down
below
#
#
We're
coming
down
to
the
ground
#
#
We
hear
the
birds
sing
in
the
trees
#
#
And
the
land
will
be
looked
after
#
#
We'll
send
the
seeds
#
Did
you
think
#
By
changing
the
script
#
Despite
all
you
made
of
it
#
#
You're
always
afraid
#
You've
got

Like
the
fish
in
the
ocean
#
#
We
felt
at
home
in
the
sea
#
#
We
learned
to
live
off
the
good
land
#
#
We
learned
to
climb
up
a
tree
#
#
Then
we
got
up
on
two
legs
#
#
But
we
wanted
to
fly
#
#
And
when

messed
up
#
We
