Anything

Anything

Be
careful.

You
never
told
me
you
spoke
Only
on
special
occasions.
So,
it
is
true?
You
found
Nurhachi?
You
know
I
did.
Last
night
one
of
your
boys
without
paying
for
him.
You
have
insulted
my
son.
No,
you
have
insulted
me.
I
spared
his
life.

Aren't
you
going
to
introduce
us?
This
is
Willie
Scott.
This
is
Indiana
Jones,
Well,
I
thought
archeologists
searching
for
their
mommies.
Mummies.
Dr.
Jones
found
Nurhachi
for
me,
and
he's
going
to
deliver
him
now.
Say,
who
is
this
Nurhachi?
Put
the
gun
away,
sonny.
I
suggest
you
give
me
what
you
owe
me
or
anything
goes.

Open
it.
The
diamond,
Lao.
The
deal
was
for
the
diamond.
Oh,
Lao...

To
your
very
good
health.
Lao!
He
put
a
hole...
He
put
two
holes
Sit
down!
Now,
you
bring
me
Nurhachi.
My
pleasure.
Who
on
Earth
is
this
Nurhachi?
Here
he
is.
This
Nurhachi's
a
real
small
guy.
Inside
are
the
remains
of
Nurhachi,
first
Emperor
of
Manchu
Dynasty.
Welcome
home,
old
boy.

And
now,
you
give
me
the
diamond.
Are
you
trying
to
develop
or
am
I
going
deaf?

What's
that?
Antidote.
To
what?
The
poison
you
just
drank,
Dr.
Jones.
The
poison
works
fast,
Dr.
Jones.

-
Lao.
You
keep
the
girl.
I
find
another.
Good
service
here.
That's
not
a
waiter.
Wu
Han's
an
old
friend.
Antidote.


Indy...
Don't
worry,
Wu
Han,
WU:
Not
this
time,
Indy.
I
followed
you
on
many
adventures,
but
into
the
great
unknown
mystery,
Don't
be
sad,
Dr.
Jones.
You
will
soon
be
joining
him.
Too
much
to
drink,
Dr.
Jones?


Oh,
nuts!


-
The
antidote.


No!
Stay
there!


Come
on.
I
don't
want
to
die!

Who
are
you?
Wow!
Holy
smoke!
Crash
landing!
Short
Round,
step
on
it.
Okeydokey,
Dr.
Jones.
For
crying
out
loud,

Wow!
Wow.
Where's
the
antidote?
Let
me
have
it.
Listen,
I
just
met
you,
for
Christ's
sakes.
Give
me...
I'm
not
that
kind
of
girl.
Hey,
Dr.
Jones,
no
time
for
love.
We
got
company.

Oh,
I
hope
you
choke.
No
shooting.


Okay,
you
asked
for
it.



This
is
fun!
Here,
hold
this.

Where's
my
gun?
Where's
my
gun?
I
burned
my
fingers,
Dr.
Jones...
I'm
Art
Weber.
I
spoke
with
your
assistant.
We've
managed
to
secure
three
seats,
but
there
might
be
as
you
will
be
riding
WILLIE:
Is

Nice

Good-bye,

No.
Do

You

WILLIE:
Where

India.
How

you
know
that?





WILLIE:
I

hope
this
means
dinner.
God,
I'm
starving.
INDY:
Thank
you.

I
can't
eat
this.
That's
more
food
They're
starving.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
You
can

Eat
it.
I'm

You're

It's

a

did

No,

it's

Was

Is

Yeah,

It's

He
climbs
Mount

That's
Siva?
-
Rocks.
He
told

to
go
forth
and
combat
evil.
And
to
help

with
magical
properties.
Magic

walk
from

say

lost.
But

cannot
imagine
the

of

look
at

not
lost.

is

Dr.

the
eminent
archeologist?
Hard
to
believe,
isn't
it?
I
remember
first
hearing
your
name
I'm
Chattar
Lal,
the
Maharajah
of
Pankot.
I'm
enchanted.
Enchanted.
Thank
you
very
much.
Welcome
to

Enchanted,
huh?

INDY:
Shorty,
where's
my
razor?


We
are
fortunate
tonight

This
is
Captain...
11th
Poona
Rifles.
And
you,
sir,
are
Dr.
Jones,
I
presume.
I
am,
Captain.
Captain
Blumburtt
and
his
troops
The
British
find
it
amusing
I
do
hope,
sir,
that
it's
not
The
British
worry
so
about
their
empire.
Makes
us
all
feel
like


You
look
beautiful.
I
think
the
Maharajah
Maybe
it
wasn't
such
a
bad
idea
You
look
like
a
princess.
Mr.
Lal,
what
do
they
call
His
Highness
has
not
yet
taken
a
wife.
How
interesting.
Well,
maybe
it's
because
His
Supreme
Highness,
guardian
of
Pankot
tradition,
the
Maharajah
of
Pankot,
Zalim
Singh.
That's
the
Maharajah?
A
kid?
Maybe
he
like
older
women.
Captain
Blumburtt
was
just
telling
me
something
of
the
interesting
the
importance
it
played
in
the
mutiny.
It
seems
the
British
never
forget

Yes,
well,
you
know,
I
think
before
the
mutiny,
going
back
a
century,
back
to
the
time
of
Clive,
CHATTAR:
And
what
events
are
those,
INDY:
Well,
if
memory
serves
me
was
the
center
of
activity

Snake...
Surprise.
What's
the
surprise?

Dr.
Jones,
you
know
perfectly
well
the
Thuggee
cult
has
been
dead
Yes,
of
course.
The
Thuggee
was
an
obscenity
that
worshipped
Kali
The
British
Army

INDY:
Well,
I
suppose
stories
CHATTAR:
INDY:
I'm
not
so
sure.
We
came
from
a
small
village.
The
peasants
there
told
us
Pankot
Palace
was
growing
because
of
some
ancient
evil.
Village
stories,
Dr.
Jones.
They're
just
fear
and
folklore.
You're
beginning
to
worry
I'm
not
worried,
Mr.
Prime
Minister,

What?
You
are
not
eating?
I
had
bugs
for
lunch.
Give
me
your
hat.
Why?
'Cause
I'm
gonna
puke
in
it.

You
know,
the
villagers
also
told
us
Dr.
Jones,
in
our
country,
it's
not
usual
for
a
guest
I'm
sorry.
I
thought
we
were
talking
about
folklore.
Excuse
me,
sir,
What
exactly
was
it
A
sacred
rock.

You
see,
Captain,
a
rock!




Something
connected
the
villagers'
rock
and
the
old
legend
CHATTAR:
Dr.
Jones,
we
are
I
seem
to
remember
that
in
Honduras
you
were
accused
of
being
rather
than
an
archeologist.
Well,
the
newspapers
greatly
And
wasn't
it
the
Sultan
of
Madagascar
if
you
ever
returned
to
his
country?
No,
it
wasn't
my
head.
Then
your
hands,
perhaps.
No,
it
wasn't
my
hands,
it
was
my...
My
misunderstanding.
Exactly
what
we
have
here,
Dr.
Jones.
MAHARAJAH:
I
have
heard

I
thought
the
stories
were
told
Later,
I
learnt
and
did
of
unspeakable
things.
I
am
ashamed
of
what
happened
here
and
I
assure
you
this
will
never
happen
again
If
I
offended
you,
then
I
am
sorry.

Dessert!
Chilled
monkey
brains.



I
think
I'll
just
check
on
Willie.
That's
all
you
better
do.
Tell
me
later
what
happened.
Am-scray.
I've
got
something
for
you.
There's
nothing
you
have
Right.

You're
a
very
nice
man.
Maybe
you
could
be
my
palace
slave.
Wear
your
jewels
to
bed,
Princess?
Yeah.
And
nothing
else.
That
shock
you?
Nothing
shocks
me.
I'm
a
scientist.
So,
as
a
scientist,
Always.
And
what
sort
of
research
Nocturnal
activities.
You
mean
like
what
sort
of
cream
what
position
I
like
to
sleep
in?
Mating
customs.
Love
rituals?
Primitive
sexual
practices.
So
you're
an
authority
in
that
area?
Years
of
fieldwork.
I
don't
blame
you
for
being
sore
at
me.
I
can
be
hard
to
handle.
I've
had
worse.
But
you'll
never
have
better.
I
don't
know.
As
a
scientist,
I'll
let
you
know
in
the
morning.
Why,
you
conceited
ape.
I'm
not
that
easy.
I'm
not
that
easy,
either.
Trouble
with
you
is,
Willie,
you're
too
used
to
getting
your
own
way.
And
you're
just
too
proud
to
admit
that
you're
crazy
about
me,
Dr.
Jones.
If
you
want
me,
Willie,
Five
minutes.
You'll
be
back
over
here
in
five
minutes.
I'll
be
asleep
in
five
minutes.
Five.
You
know
it,
and
I
know
it.
Five
minutes.
Four
and
a
half.




"Palace
slave."
"Nocturnal
activities."
I'm
a
"conceited
ape"?

"I'll
tell
you
in
the
morning."
I
can't
believe
it.
He's
not
coming.
She's
not
coming.
I
can't
believe
I'm
not
going.


Indiana
Jones!
This
is
one
night
you'll
never
forget!
This
is
the
night
Sleep
tight,
and
pleasant
dreams!

I
could
have
been

Jones,
your
whip!

Shorty,
turn
off
the
switch.
Oh,
Indy.
Be
gentle
with
me.
Be
gentle
with
me.
But
I'm
here.
There's
nobody
here.
No,
I'm
here.
Indy,
you're
acting
awfully
strange.
Hey,
I'm
right
here.

"Follow
in
the
footsteps
of
Siva."
WILLIE:
What
does
that
mean?
"Do
not
betray
these
truths."
Shorty,
go
get
our
stuff.

INDY:
Stay
behind
me,
Short
Round.
Step
where
I
step,


I
step
where
you
step.
I
touch
nothing.
Indy!

SHORTY:
I
step
on
something.

We're

Trouble?
Trouble?
What
sort
of...

This
is
serious!
There
are
two
dead
people
down
here!
There're
going
to
be
I've
almost
had
enough
of
you
two.
Willie!
What's
the
rush?
It's
a
long
story,
Willie.
God,
what
is
this?
Indy,
what
is
this?
I
can't
see
a
thing!
Hurry!
All

Oh,
I
broke
a
nail.

my
hair!
INDY:
Shut

Willie!

Indy,
let

Let

INDY:
Shut

They're

What?
A

that
opens
the
door.
-
Go

INDY:
Go
to
the
right
hole.
SHORTY:
Hurry,
Willie!


INDY:
The
other
one!
The
other
right.
-
The
one
on
your
right!
I
can't
do
it.
You
can
do
it.
Feel
inside.
Okay.

You
feel
inside!
Do
it
now!
Okay!

Willie,
we
are
going
to
die!
WILLIE:
It's

It's

Got

of
me!
Get

They're

Get

No!
It
wasn't
me!
It's
her!
Huh?
Come
on!
Go!
Move!
Come
on,
move!
Come
on!



It's
a
Thuggee
ceremony.
They're
worshipping
Kali.
Have
you
ever
seen
anything
Nobody's
seen
this
for
a
hundred
years.




Kali
Ma.
Kali
Ma...
Kali
Ma!


-



He's
still
alive.




Kali
Ma.

That's
the
rock
It's
one
of
the
Sankara
Stones.
Why
they
glow
like
that?

The
legend
says
when
the
rocks
are
brought
together,
the
diamonds
inside
them
will
glow.
Diamonds?
Diamonds.
-
Diamonds!
Diamonds.
Hey,
hey.
Look,
I
want
you
two
Shorty,
you
keep
an
eye
on
her.
-
Why,
where
are
you
going?
Down
there?
Are
you
crazy?
I'm
not
leaving
here
without
the
stones.
You
could
get
killed
chasing
after
Maybe.
But
not
today.

Be
careful.

Where's
he
going?

Let
me
go!
Run,
Willie!
Run!



Dr.
Jones!
I
keep
telling
you,
you
listen
me
more,
you
live
longer.
BOY:
Please,
let
me
die.
I
pray
to
Siva,
"Let
me
die,"
but
I
do
not.
Now...
Now
the
evil
of
Kali
take
me.
How?
They
will
make
me
drink
Then
I'll
fall
into
What
is
that?
We
become
like
them.
We'll
be
alive,
but
like
a
nightmare.
You
drink
blood,
You
were
caught
trying
to
steal
There
were
five
stones
in
the
beginning.
Over
the
centuries,
sold
off
by
thieves
like
you.
Thieves
like
me,
huh?

Still
missing
two.
A
century
ago,
and
butchered
my
people,
a
loyal
priest
hid
the
last
two
stones
So
that's
what
you've
got
They're
innocent
children.
They
dig
for
the
gems
They
also
search
Soon
we
will
have
and
the
Thuggees
will
be
all
powerful.
What
a
vivid
imagination.

You
don't
believe
me?
You
will,
Dr.
Jones.
You
will
become
a
true
believer.


Hi.

SHORTY:
Dr.
Jones!
Don't
drink,
it's
bad!
Don't
drink!
Spit
it
out!



Dr.
Jones...



You
dare
not
do
that.


Leave
him
alone,
you
bastards!
The
British
in
India
will
be
slaughtered.
Then
we
will
overrun
the
Muslims.
Then
the
Hebrew
God
will
fall.
And
then
the
Christian
God

Soon,
Kali
Ma
will
rule
the
world.

Dr.
Jones...








Kali
Ma
protects
us.
We
are
her
children.
We
pledge
our
devotion
to
her
with
an
offering
of
flesh...
WILLIE:
What
are
you
doing?
...and
blood.
Your
friend
has
seen,
Now
she
will
not
talk.
I'm
not
going
to
have
about
this
place
when
I
get
back.

For
God
sakes,

matter
with
you?


No,

of
them.
You're
not
one
of
them.
Please

back
to
us.
Don't
leave
me.


No!
What

you
doing?
Are
you
