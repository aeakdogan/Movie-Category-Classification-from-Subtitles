is

And
he
changed
everything.
John
showed
us
how
to
fight

how

My
parents
had
a
cabin
My
dad
and
I
would
always
Mom
would
wave
to
us
I
was
just
looking
at
her...
and
then
the
cabin
exploded.
I
thought
the
boat
was
sinking,
coming
up
from
below,
A
T-1000?
Dad
told
me
to
swim
Tracing
his
finger
"You
can
do
this,"
he
said.
"You

His
last
words

them.
How?
It's

thinking
She's...
She's

Ah...
Sorry.
Sorry.

Then
I
jumped
in
and
I

isn't
it?
You
realize
you
haven't
had
a

with
a

you
were
a

Yeah

it's

you'd
sing
him
'Rocket

John?
But
you
got

terrible

I'm
sorry.
It's
him.
Has
to
be.
Hey...
How...
How
can
you
be
here?
I
have
a
million
questions
But,
right
now
we
need
to
move.
Did
you
bring
anyone
with
you?
Sorta...
How
did
you

You
can't

That's
how
The
timeline
changed.
See,
this
is
the
moment
Before
it
comes
online
-
You're
right.
Yeah,
how'd
you
end
up
in
2017?
Well,
the
same
as
you,
Dad,
Dad?
You
didn't
tell
him?
-
This
can
wait.
What?
Sarah
is
my
mother,
Kyle.
And
you're
my
father.
-
W-Why
wouldn't
you
say
something?
Not
without
the
risk
of
-
You're
my
son?
Our
son?
I'm
glad
you
finally
know.
For
us
to
be
together.
Now
we
can
win
this.
Ah!
I
know.
Pops!
No,
it's
OK
he's
with
me.
What
are
you
doing?
-
Pops!
Breathe,
breathe,
breathe...
Why
did
you
do
that?
Because
he's
a
killer!
This
was
always
Find
John
and
terminate
him?
Let
him
go.
Right
now!
That
hurt.
Was
that
pain
real,
or
was
that...
...a
trick
of
memory
...less?
Well!
This
explains
a
lot.
Who
sent
you
here,
Kyle?
John,
no.
It's
not
John.
Shit!
Call
it
in.
Search
the
hospital.
Goddamn
time-traveling
robots!
Don't!
This
is
a
tactical
error.
Something
tells
me
you're
not
This
has
happened
when
SkyNet
didn't
attack
me,
Kyle,
I'm

Not

I'm

John,
come
in!
Repeat:
Connor!

realised
the
one
Me.

are

I'm

can't

A

If
we
refuse?
Then
you
die.
You
can't
kill
us,
we're
your
parents.
Says
who?
You
know
what
I
think?
We're
marooned,
the
three
of
us.
We're
exiles
in
time.
You
see,
I
can
kill
you...
For
ther
truly
is
no
fate.
Are
you
with
me?
The
answer
is
no.
Hear
that,
Kyle?
That's
the
dice
rolling.
Come
on!
We
gotta
keep
moving,
let's
go!
I
can't
leave
him.
Sarah!
Attention

Pops.
I...
thought
you
would
be
smarter.
I...
thought...
you
would...
understand.
I'm
sorry,
John.
That
thing
won't
hold
him
Reese!
Whatever
they
did
to
him,
We
need
to
get
him
back.
He's
not

means
John's
There's
no
way
of
knowing
You're
right
and
that's
John
is
not
humanity's
He's
SkyNet.
It's
a

the
best
there
is

that
and
nothing
else.

can't

it
just
can't

OK.
Hold

You

What
about
John?
I
think
he's
doing
just
fine.
-
Did
you
see
him?
You
can
bet
he
sees
us.
I
know
who
you
are.
John
told
me.
You
want
to
destroy
me.
You're
SkyNet?
I'm
becoming
SkyNet.
You're
not

I
know
what

are

What

your

I
don't

The
countdown
jumped
again.
I
won't
allow
this.
What
are
you
gonna
do,
talk
us
to

And
you

You

Pops!
Do

now!
I
cannot.
I
cannot

Theoretically.
What
was

said?
"I
don't
think
so"?
No
That's
the
thing
that
attacked
John.
I
didn't
attack
John.
Primates
evolve
over
millions
of
years,
And
I...
am
here.
In
exactly
four
minutes...
I
will
be
everywhere.
You're
nothing
but
a
relic
This
is
pointless,
Go!
My
existence
is
inevitable.
Why
can't
you
just
accept
that?
Because
we're
human.

stop
now.

Pops,
Pops,
please!
Please,
Pops.

is
almost
free.
I
cannot
hold
John
Connor
much
longer.
Kyle
Reese...
protect
my
Sarah.
No,
no,
no!
No,
Pops.
Pops!
Pops!
-
No!
It's
the
only
way.
Come
on.
Scanning:
Sarah,
Connor.
We
gotta
get
outta
here.
Sarah,
he's
gone.
-
He's...
Yeah,
I
know
that.
We
leave
no
part
He
loved
you.
Anyone
who
loves
me...
all
of
them...
they
die.
Not
all.
Not
this
time.
You
need
to
understand
that
SkyNet's
gone.
You're
free.
For
the
first
time...
you
can
choose
th
life
you
want.
Any
life
you
want.
What
if
I
don't
know
how?
Well,
since
we're
about
to
run
out
of
air,
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
it.
Hello,
Sarah
Connor.
Pops.
I
thought
you
were
dead.
No,

What
is

Kyle.
What

you
doing
here?

of
mine
really
needs
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
Thank
you.
I
like
her.
I
do,
too.
This
is
gonna
sound
but
there's
something
A
message.
Who
do
I
tell?
Yourself.
Over
and
over.
Are
you
ready?
It
goes
like
this:
Remember:
Genisys
is
SkyNet.
Kyle
Reese
is
a
good
man.
He
is.
So,
what
now?
You're
right.
I
can
choose.
That's
really
disturbing,
all
right?
You'll
get
used
to
it.
It
was
over.
SkyNet
was
gone.
Now,
one
road

Though
questions
remain,
But
one
thing
we
know
for
sure,
the
future
is
not
set.
