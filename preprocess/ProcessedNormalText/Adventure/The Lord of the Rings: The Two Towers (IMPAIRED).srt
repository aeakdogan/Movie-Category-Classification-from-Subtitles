GANDALF:
You
cannot
pass!
GANDALF:
I
am
a
servant
of
the
Secret
Fire,
Go
back
to
the
Shadow.
The
dark
fire
will
not
avail
you,
You
shall
not
pass!



BOROMIR:
Gandalf!
Fly,
you
fools.
No!
Gandalf!


Gandalf!
What
is
it,
Mr.
Frodo?
Nothing.
Just
a
dream.
Mordor.
The
one
place
in
Middle-earth
And
it's
the
one
place
It's
just
where
we
can't
get.
Let's
face
it,
Mr.
Frodo,
we're
lost.
I
don't
think
Gandalf
meant
for
us
He
didn't
mean
for
a
lot
of
things
...but
they
did.


Mr.
Frodo?
It's
the
Ring,
isn't
it?
It's
getting
heavier.
-
What
food
have
we
got
left?
Oh,
yes.
Lovely.
Lembas
bread.
And
look!
More
lembas
bread.
I
don't
usually
hold
with
foreign
food...
...but
this
Elvish
stuff,
it's
not
bad.
Nothing
ever
dampens
your
spirits,

Those
rain
clouds
might.
SAM:
It's
because
we've
been
here
before.
We're
going
in
circles.
SAM:
I
warrant
there's
a
nasty
bog
nearby.
-
Can
you
smell
it?
I
can
smell
it.
We're
not
alone.


The
thieves.
The
thieves.
The
filthy
little
thieves.
Where
is
it?
They
stole
it
from
us.
My
precious.
Curse
them,
we
hates
them!
It's
ours,
it
is,
and
we
wants
it!




This
is
Sting.
You've
seen
it
before...
...haven't
you,
Gollum?

Release
him
or
I'll
cut
your
throat.


It
burns!
It
burns
us!
It
freezes!
Nasty
Elves
twisted
it.
-
Take
it
off
us!
It's
hopeless.
Every
Orc
in
Mordor's
-
Let's
just
tie
him
up
and
leave
him.
That
would
kill
us!
Kill
us!
It's
no
more
than
you
deserve!
Maybe
he
does
deserve
to
die.
But
now
that
I
see
him,
I
do
pity
him.
We
be
nice
to
them
Take
it
off
us.
We
swears
to
do
what
you
wants.
We
swears.
There's
no
promise
you
can
make
We
swears...
...to
serve
the
master
of
the
precious.
We
will
swear
on...
...on
the
precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The
Ring
is
treacherous.
Yes...
...on
the
precious.
On
the
precious.
I
don't
believe
you!
-
Get
down!
I
said,
down!
He's
trying
to
trick
us.
If
we
let
him
go,

-
You
know
the
way
to
Mordor?
You've
been
there
before?
Yes.
You
will
lead
us
to
the
Black
Gate.
Merry!
What
is
it?
What
do
you
smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've
picked
up
our
trail.
Let's
move!

Their
pace
has
quickened.
They
must
have
caught
our
scent.
Hurry!
Come
on,
Gimli!
Three
days
and
nights
pursuit.
No
food.
No
rest.
And
no
sign
of
our
quarry,
Not
idly
do
the
leaves
of
Lórien
fall.
They
may
yet
be
alive.
Less
than
a
day
ahead
of
us.
Come.

Come,
Gimli!
We're
gaining
on
them!
I'm
wasted
on
cross-country.
Very
dangerous
over
short
distances.
ARAGORN:
Home
of
the
Horse-lords.
There's
something
strange
at
work
here.
Some
evil
gives
speed
Sets
its
will
against
us.
ARAGORN:
LEGOLAS:
They
are
taking
the
Hobbits
to
Isengard.
Saruman.

SARUMAN:
Who
now
has
the
strength
to
stand
...and
Mordor?
To
stand
against
the
might
of
Sauron
...and
the
union
of
the
two
towers?
Together,
my
Lord
Sauron...
...we
shall
rule
this
Middle-earth.

SARUMAN:
The
Old
World
will
The
forests
will
fall.
A
new
order
will
rise.
We
will
drive
the
machine
of
war
...and
the
iron
fists
of
the
Orc.
We
have
only
to
remove
The
Horse-Men
took
your
lands.
They
drove
your
people
into
the
hills
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Burn
every
village!

SARUMAN:
Too
long
have
these
peasants
But
no
more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You
take
your
sister.
Papa
says
Éothain
must
not
ride
Garulf.
He
is
too
big
for
him.
Listen
to
me.
You
must
ride
to
Edoras
-
Do
you
understand
me?
I
don't
want
to
leave.
Freda,
I
will
find
you
there.

Quickly!
Go,
child.
SARUMAN:
...is
ready
to
fall.
Théodred.
ÉOWYN:
He
was
ambushed
by
Orcs.
If
we
don't
defend
our
country,
That
is
a
lie.
Saruman
the
White
has
ever
been
THÉODEN:
Gríma.
Orcs
are
roaming
freely
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Orcs
bearing
the
White
Hand
of
Saruman.
Why
do
you
lay
these
troubles
Can
you
not
see?
Your
uncle
is
wearied
...your
warmongering.
Warmongering?
How
long
is
it
since
What
was
the
promised
price,
Gríma?
When
all
the
Men
are
dead,
Too
long
have
you
watched
my
sister.
Too
long
have
you
haunted
her
steps.
You
see
much,
Éomer,
son
of
Éomund.
Too
much.

You
are
banished
forthwith
...under
pain
of
death.

Keep
breathing.
That's
the
key.
Breathe.
They've
run
as
if
the
very
whips
ORC
1:
...until
we've
had
a
breather.
Get
a
fire
going!
Merry!
I
think
we
might
have
made
a
mistake

What's
making
that
noise?
It's
the
trees.
What?
You
remember
the
Old
Forest,
Folk
used
to
say
there
was
something
...and
come
alive.
Alive?
Trees
that
could
whisper...
...talk
to
each
other...
...even
move.
I'm
starving.
We
ain't
had
nothing
but
maggoty
bread
Yeah!
Why
can't
we
have
some
meat?!
What
about
them?
They're
fresh.
They
are
not
for
eating.

What
about
their
legs?
They
don't
need
those.
-
They
look
tasty.
ORC
2:
Carve
them
up!
LEADER:
Looks
like
meat's

Pippin.
Let's
go.
Go
on.
Call
for
help.
Squeal.
No
one's
going
to
save
you
now.


MERRY:


A
red
sun
rises.
Blood
has
been
spilled
this
night.


Riders
of
Rohan...
...what
news
from
the
Mark?
What
business
does
an
Elf,
a
Man
Speak
quickly!
Give
me
your
name,
horse-master,
I
would
cut
off
your
head,
Dwarf...
...if
it
stood
but
a
little
higher
You
would
die
before
your
stroke
fell.
I
am
Aragorn,
son
of
Arathorn.
This
is
Gimli,
son
of
Glóin,
We
are
friends
of
Rohan
Théoden
no
longer
recognizes
Not
even
his
own
kin.
Saruman
has
poisoned
the
mind
...and
claimed
lordship
over
these
lands.
My
company
are
those
loyal
to
Rohan.
And
for
that,
we
are
banished.
The
White
Wizard
is
cunning.
He
walks
here
and
there,
they
say...
...as
an
old
man
hooded
and
cloaked.
And
everywhere,
We
are
no
spies.
We
track
a
party
of
Uruk-hai
They
have
taken
The
Uruks
are
destroyed.
But
there
were
two
Hobbits.
They
would
be
small.
We
left
none
alive.
We
piled
the
carcasses
and
burned
them.
Dead?
I
am
sorry.

Hasufel!
Arod!
May
these
horses
bear
you
to
better
Farewell.
Look
for
your
friends.
But
do
not
trust
to
hope.
It
has
forsaken
these
lands.
We
ride
north!
It's
one
of
their
wee
belts.


We
failed
them.
A
Hobbit
lay
here.
And
the
other.

They
crawled.
Their
hands
were
bound.
Their
bonds
were
cut.

They
ran
over
here.
They
were
followed.
MERRY:
Run!
Tracks
lead
away
from
the
battle...
...into
Fangorn
Forest.
Fangorn?
What
madness
drove
them
in
there?
PIPPIN:

I'm
going
to
rip
out
Come
here!
Trees.
Climb
a
tree.
He's
gone.

Merry!


Let's
put
a
maggot
hole
in
your
belly!
Run,
Merry!
Little
Orcs.
It's
talking,
Merry.
The
tree
is
talking.
Tree?
I
am
no
tree!
I
am
an
Ent.
A
tree-herder.
A
shepherd
of
the
forest.
Don't
talk
to
it,
Merry.
Don't
encourage
it!
Treebeard,
some
call
me.
And
whose
side
are
you
on?
Side?
I
am
on
nobody's
side...
...because
nobody's
on
my
side,
Nobody
cares
for
the
woods
anymore.
We're
not
Orcs!
We're
Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never
heard
of
a
Hobbit
before.
Sounds
like
Orc
mischief
to
me!

They
come
with
fire.
They
come
with
axes.
Gnawing,
biting,
breaking,
-
Destroyers
and
usurpers!
Curse
them!
You
don't
understand.
We're
Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe
you
are...
...and
maybe
you
aren't.
The
White
Wizard
will
know.
The
White
Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
We've
led
you
out.
Hurry,
Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very
lucky
we
find
you.
Nice
Hobbit.
SAM:
It's
a
bog.
He's
led
us
into
a
swamp.
A
swamp,
yes,
yes.
Come,
master.
We
will
take
you
Come,
Hobbits!
Come!
We
go
quickly.
I
found
it.
I
did.
The
way
through
the
marshes.
Orcs
don't
use
it.
Orcs
don't
know
it.
They
go
around
for
miles
and
miles.
Come
quickly.
Soft
and
quick
as
shadows
we
must
be.
SAM:
Dead
faces
in
the
water.
GOLLUM:
Elves
and
Men
and
Orcses.
A
great
battle
long
ago.
Dead
Marshes.
Yes.
Yes,
that
is
their
name.
This
way.
Don't
follow
the
lights.
Oh.
Careful
now!
Or
Hobbits
go
down
...and
light
little
candles
of
their
own.
Frodo!

-
Gollum?
FRODO:
Gollum!
Are
you
all
right?

GOLLUM:
So
beautiful.
Our
precious.
What
did
you
say?
Master
should
be
resting.
Master
needs
to
keep
up
his
strength.
-
Who
are
you?
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf
told
me
you
were
Cold
be
heart
and
hand
and
bone
He
said
your
life
was
a
sad
story.
They
do
not
see
what
lies
ahead
You
were
not
so
very
different
Were
you?
Sméagol.
What
did
you
call
me?
That
was
your
name
once,
wasn't
it?
A
long
time
ago.
My
name.
Sméagol.

Black
Riders!
SMÉAGOL:

Come
on,
Frodo.
Come
on!
SMÉAGOL:
-
I
thought
they
were
dead.
No,
you
cannot
kill
them.
No.



SMÉAGOL:
Wraiths
on
wings!
They
are
calling
for
it.
They
are
calling
for
the
precious.
Mr.
Frodo!
It's
all
right.
I'm
here.

SMÉAGOL:
The
Black
Gate
is
very
close.
Orc
blood.
These
are
strange
tracks.
The
air
is
so
close
in
here.
This
forest
is
old.
Very
old.
Full
of
memory...

...and
anger.

The
trees
are
speaking
to
each
other.
ARAGORN:
Lower
your
ax.
Oh.


Do
not
let
him
speak.
We
must
be
quick.

WHITE
WIZARD:
You
are
tracking
Where
are
they?
They
passed
this
way
They
met
someone
they
did
not
expect.
Does
that
comfort
you?
Who
are
you?
Show
yourself!
It
cannot
be.
You
fell.
Through
fire...
...and
water.
From
the
lowest
dungeon
...I
fought
with
the
Balrog
of
Morgoth.
Until
at
last
I
threw
down
my
enemy...
...and
smote
his
ruin
Darkness
took
me...
...and
I
strayed
out
of
thought
Stars
wheeled
overhead...
...and
every
day
was
as
long
But
it
was
not
the
end.
I
felt
life
in
me
again.

I've
been
sent
back...
...until
my
task
is
done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That
was
what
they
used
to
call
me.
Gandalf
the
Grey.
That
was
my
name.
Gandalf.
I
am
Gandalf
the
White.
And
I
come
back
to
you
now...
...at
the
turn
of
the
tide.
One
stage
of
your
journey
is
over.
War
has
come
to
Rohan.


That
is
one
of
the
Mearas...
...unless
my
eyes
are
cheated
GANDALF:
He
is
the
lord
of
all
horses...
...and
has
been
my
friend
TREEBEARD:
...near
the
roots
of
the
mountain.
I
told
Gandalf
I
would
keep
you
safe.
And
safe
is
where
I'll
keep
you.
The
trees
have
grown
wild
Anger
festers
in
their
hearts.
They
will
harm
you
if
they
can.
There
are
too
few
of
us
now.
Too
few
of
us
Ents
left
to
manage
them.
SMÉAGOL:
Oh,
save
us.
My
old
Gaffer
would
have
a
thing
or
two
SMÉAGOL:
Master
says
to
So
good
Sméagol
does,
master
says
so.
I
did.
That's
it,
then.
We
can't
get
past
that.


Look!
The
gate.
It's
opening!
I
can
see
a
way
down.
Sam,
no!
Master!

-
I
do
not
ask
you
to
come
with
me,
Sam.
I
doubt
even
these
Elvish
cloaks
-
Now!
No!
No,
master!
They
catch
you!
They
catch
you!
Don't
take
it
to
him.
He
wants
the
precious.
Always
he
is
looking
for
it.
And
the
precious
is
wanting
But
we
mustn't
let
him
have
it.
No!
There's
another
way.
More
secret.
A
dark
way.
-
Why
haven't
you
spoken
of
this
before?
He's
up
to
something.
Are
you
saying
there's
another
way
Yes.
There's
a
path...
...and
some
stairs.
And
then...
...a
tunnel.

He's
led
us
this
far,
Sam.
Mr.
Frodo,
no.
He's
been
true
to
his
word.
No.
Lead
the
way,
Sméagol.
Good
Sméagol
always
helps.
GANDALF:
There
dwells
Théoden,
King
of
Rohan...
...whose
mind
is
overthrown.
Saruman's
hold
over
King
Théoden
ÉOWYN:
...he
is
dead.
My
lord?
Uncle?
Will
you
not
go
to
him?
Will
you
do
nothing?
Be
careful
what
you
say.
Do
not
look
for
welcome
here.
Oh,
he
must
have
died
What
a
tragedy
for
the
king...
...to
lose
his
only
son
and
heir.
I
understand.
Especially
now
that
your
brother
Leave
me
alone,
snake!
Oh,
but
you
are
alone.
Who
knows
what
you've
spoken
...in
the
bitter
watches
of
the
night...
...when
all
your
life
seems
to
shrink.
The
walls
of
your
bower
A
hutch
to
trammel
some
wild
thing
in.
So
fair.
So
cold.
Like
a
morning
of
pale
spring...
...still
clinging
to
winter's
chill.
Your
words
are
poison.

You'll
find
more
cheer
in
a
graveyard.
Ah.
I
cannot
allow
you
before
Théoden
King
By
order
of
Gríma
Wormtongue.
Your
staff.
You
would
not
part
an
old
man
My
lord,
Gandalf
the
Grey
is
coming.
He's
a
herald
of
woe.
The
courtesy
of
your
hall
...Théoden
King.
He's
not
welcome.
Why
should
I
welcome
you...
...Gandalf
Stormcrow?
A
just
question,
my
liege.
Late
is
the
hour...
...in
which
this
conjurer
Láthspell
I
name
him.
Ill
news
is
an
ill
guest.
Be
silent.
Keep
your
forked
tongue
I
have
not
passed
...to
bandy
crooked
words
His
staff.
I
told
you
to
take
the
wizard's
staff.
Théoden...
...son
of
Thengel...
...too
long
have
you
sat
in
the
Shadows.
I
would
stay
still
if
I
were
you.
Hearken
to
me!
I
release
you...
...from
the
spell.

You
have
no
power
here...
...Gandalf
the
Grey.

I
will
draw
you,
Saruman,

Wait.
SARUMAN'S
VOICE:
You
did
not
kill
me...
...you
will
not
kill
him.
Rohan
is
mine.
Be
gone.


I
know
your
face.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe
the
free
air
again,
my
friend.
Dark
have
been
my
dreams
of
late.
Your
fingers
would
remember
...if
they
grasped
your
sword.


WORMTONGUE:
...ever
served
you,
my
lord.
Your
leechcraft
would
have
had
me
Send
me
not
from
your
sight.

ARAGORN:
Let
him
go.
Enough
blood
has
been
spilt
WORMTONGUE:
MAN:
Where
is
Théodred?
Where
is
my
son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever
has
it
grown
on
the
tombs
Now
it
shall
cover
the
grave
of
my
son.
Alas
that
these
evil
days
should
be
mine.
The
young
perish
and
the
old
linger.
That
I
should
live...
...to
see
the
last
days
of
my
house.
Théodred's
death
No
parent
should
have
to
bury
their
child.
GANDALF:
His
spirit
will
find
its
way

They
had
no
warning.
They
were
unarmed.
Now
the
Wild
Men
are
moving
through
Rick,
cot
and
tree.
-
Where
is
Mama?
This
is
but
a
taste
of
the
terror
All
the
more
potent
for
he
is
driven
now
Ride
out
and
meet
him
head-on.
Draw
him
away
from
your
women
You
must
fight.
You
have
2000
good
men
riding
north
Éomer
is
loyal
to
you.
His
men
will
return
They
will
be
300
leagues
from
here
Éomer
cannot
help
us.
I
know
what
it
is
you
want
of
me...
...but
I
will
not
bring
further
death
I
will
not
risk
open
war.
Open
war
is
upon
you,
THÉODEN:
...Théoden,
not
Aragorn,

Then
what
is
the
king's
decision?
HÁMA:
...the
city
must
empty.
We
make
for
the
refuge
of
Helm's
Deep.
Do
not
burden
yourself
with
treasures.
GIMLI:
They
flee
to
the
mountains
Who
will
defend
them
if
not
their
king?
He's
only
doing
what
he
thinks
Helm's
Deep
has
saved
them
There
is
no
way
out
of
that
ravine.
He
thinks
he's
leading
them
to
safety.
What
they
will
get
is
a
massacre.
Théoden
has
a
strong
will,
I
fear
for
the
survival
of
Rohan.
He
will
need
you
before
the
end,
The
people
of
Rohan
will
need
you.
The
defenses
have
to
hold.
They
will
hold.
The
Grey
Pilgrim.
That's
what
they
used
to
call
me.
Three
hundred
lives
of
Men
I've
walked
With
luck,
my
search
will
not
Look
to
my
coming
at
first
light
At
dawn,
look
to
the
east.
Go.
You
have
some
skill
with
a
blade.
Women
of
this
country
learned
long
ago:
Those
without
swords
I
fear
neither
death
nor
pain.
What
do
you
fear,
my
lady?
A
cage.
To
stay
behind
bars
until
use
And
all
chance
of
valor
has
gone
You're
a
daughter
of
kings...
...a
shieldmaiden
of
Rohan.
I
do
not
think
that
would
be
your
fate.
WORMTONGUE:
It's
vulnerable.
He
knows
this.
He
will
expect
an
attack
on
the
city.
They
will
flee
to
Helm's
Deep...
...the
great
fortress
of
Rohan.
It
is
a
dangerous
road
to
take
They
will
be
slow.
They
will
have
women
and
children
Send
out
your
Warg-riders.


Hey,
stinker,
don't
go
getting
-
Why
do
you
do
that?
Call
him
names.
Because.
Because
that's
what
he
is,
Mr.
Frodo.
There's
naught
left
in
him
It's
the
Ring
he
wants.
You
have
no
idea
what
it
did
to
him...
...what
it's
still
doing
to
him.
I
want
to
help
him,
Sam.
Why?
Because
I
have
to
believe
You
can't
save
him,
Mr.
Frodo.
What
do
you
know
about
it?
Nothing!
I'm
sorry,
Sam.
I
do.
It's
the
Ring.
You
can't
take
your
eyes
off
it.
I've
seen
you.
You're
not
eating.
You
barely
sleep.
It's
taken
hold
of
you,
Mr.
Frodo.
-
You
have
to
fight
it.
The
Ring
was
entrusted
to
me.
Mine!
My
own!
Can't
you
hear
yourself?
Don't
you
know
who
you
sound
like?
GOLLUM:
We
needs
it.
Must
have
the
precious.
They
stole
it
from
us.
Sneaky
little
Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMÉAGOL:
GOLLUM:
They
will
cheat
you,
hurt
you,
lie!
SMÉAGOL:
GOLLUM:
You
don't
have
any
friends.
Not
listening.
I'm
not
listening.
You're
a
liar
and
a
thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go
away.
Go
away?
I
hate
you.
Where
would
you
be
without
me?
I
saved
us.
It
was
me.
We
survived
because
of
me.
Not
anymore.
What
did
you
say?
Master
looks
after
us
now.
We
don't
need
you.
What?
Leave
now...
...and
never
come
back.
No.
Leave
now
and
never
come
back.

Leave
now
and
never
come
back!
We
told
him
to
go
away.
And
away
he
goes,
precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol
is
free!
SMÉAGOL:
Look.
See
what
Sméagol
finds?

They
are
young.
They
are
tender.
They
are
nice.
Yes,
they
are.
Eat
them.
Eat
them!
You'll
make
him
sick,
you
will...
...behaving
like
that.
There's
only
one
way
to
eat

What's
it
doing?
Stupid,
fat
Hobbit.
It
ruins
it.
What's
to
ruin?

What
we
need
is
a
few
good
taters.
What's
taters,
precious?
What's
taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil
them,
mash
them,
Lovely,
big,
golden
chips
Even
you
couldn't
say
no
to
that.
Oh,
yes,
we
could.
Spoil
a
nice
fish.
Give
it
to
us
raw...
...and
wriggling.
You
keep
nasty
chips.
You're
hopeless.
Mr.
Frodo?
SAM:
Who
are
they?
Servants
of
Sauron.
They
are
called
to
Mordor.
The
Dark
One
is
gathering
all
armies
It
won't
be
long
now.
-
Ready
to
do
what?
The
last
war
that
will
cover
We've
got
to
get
moving.
Come
on,
Sam.

Mr.
Frodo.
Look.
It's
an
oliphaunt.
No
one
at
home
will
believe
this.

Sméagol?

We've
lingered
here
too
long.
Come
on,
Sam.
Aye!

Bind
their
hands.
GIMLI:
It's
true,
you
don't
see
And
in
fact,
they
are
so
alike
...that
they're
often
mistaken
It's
the
beards.
This,
in
turn,
...that
there
are
no
Dwarf
women...
...and
that
Dwarves
just
spring
out
...which
is,
of
course,
ridiculous.

GIMLl:
That
was
deliberate.
It
was
deliberate.
ARWEN:
The
light
of
the
Evenstar
It
is
mine
to
give
to
whom
I
will.
Like
my
heart.
Go
to
sleep.
I
am
asleep.
This
is
a
dream.
Then
it
is
a
good
dream.
Sleep.

Arwen...
ÉOWYN:
The
woman
who
gave
you
that
jewel.
ELROND:
Arwen's
time
is
ending.
Let
her
go.
Let
her
take
the
ship
into
the
west.
Let
her
bear
away
her
love
for
you
There
it
will
be
ever
green.
But
never
more
than
memory.
I
will
not
leave
my
daughter
here
to
die.
-
She
stays
because
she
still
has
hope.
She
belongs
with
her
people.


I
am
mortal.
You
are
Elf-kind.
It
was
a
dream,
Arwen.
Nothing
more.
This
belongs
to
you.
It
was
a
gift.
Keep
it.
ÉOWYN:
She
is
sailing
to
the
Undying
Lands

What
is
it?
-
Háma?

Wargs!
A
scout!
-
What
is
it?
What
do
you
see?
Get
them
out
of
here!
All
riders
to
the
head
of
the
column.
GIMLl:
Come
on!

You
must
lead
the
people
-
I
can
fight.
You
must
do
this,
for
me.
Follow
me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I
mean,
charge
forward.
-
That's
it!
Go
on!

GIMLl:
That
one
counts
as
mine!
Stinking
creature.





Aragorn!
Aragorn?

Tell
me
what
happened
He's...
...dead.
He
took
a
little
tumble
off
the
cliff.
You
lie.

Get
the
wounded
on
horses.
The
wolves
of
Isengard
will
return.
Leave
the
dead.
Come.
WOMAN
1:
At
last!
WOMAN
3:
WOMAN
4:
We're
safe,
my
lady.
Thank
you.
FREDA:
Mama!
Freda!
GAMLING:
Make
way
for
Théoden.
So
few.
So
few
of
you
have
returned.
Our
people
are
safe.
We
have
paid
for
it
with
many
lives.
GIMLl:
Lord
Aragorn...
...where
is
he?
He
fell.
Draw
all
our
forces
behind
the
wall.
Bar
the
gate.
GAMLING:
What
of
those
who
cannot
fight,
THÉODEN:
Saruman's
arm
will
have
grown
long
indeed
WORMTONGUE:
Its
outer
wall
is
solid
rock...
...but
for
a
small
culvert
at
its
base...
...which
is
little
more
than
a
drain.
How?
How
can
fire
undo
stone?
What
kind
of
device
If
the
wall
is
breached,
Even
if
it
is
breached,
it
would
take
...thousands,
to
storm
the
Keep.
SARUMAN:
WORMTONGUE:


A
new
power
is
rising.
Its
victory
is
at
hand.
This
night...
...the
land
will
be
stained
March
to
Helm's
Deep!
Leave
none
alive!
To
war!
There
will
be
no
dawn
for
Men.
Look.
There's
smoke
to
the
south.
There
is
always
smoke
rising...
...from
Isengard
these
days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
...when
Saruman
would
walk
in
my
woods.
But
now
he
has
a
mind
of
metal...
...and
wheels.
He
no
longer
cares
for
growing
things.
What
is
it?
It's
Saruman's
army.
The
war
has
started.
ARWEN:
Brego.
ELROND:


He
is
not
coming
back.
Why
do
you
linger
here
There
is
still
hope.
If
Aragorn
survives
this
war,
If
Sauron
is
defeated
...and
all
that
you
hope
for
...you
will
still
have
to
taste
Whether
by
the
sword
...Aragorn
will
die.
And
there
will
be
no
comfort
...no
comfort
to
ease
the
pain
He
will
come
to
death...
...an
image
of
the
splendor
...in
glory
undimmed
before
But
you,
my
daughter...
...you
will
linger
on
in
darkness
...as
nightfall
in
winter
Here
you
will
dwell...
...bound
to
your
grief
...until
all
the
world
is
changed...
...and
the
long
years
of
your
life
Arwen.
There
is
nothing
for
you
here...
...only
death.


GALADRIEL:
Sauron
will
use
his
puppet,
...to
destroy
the
people
of
Rohan.
Isengard
has
been
unleashed.
The
Eye
of
Sauron
now
turns
...the
last
free
kingdom
of
Men.
His
war
on
this
country
He
senses
the
Ring
is
close.
The
strength
of
the
Ring-bearer
In
his
heart,
Frodo
begins
...the
quest
will
claim
his
life.
You
know
this.
You
have
foreseen
it.
It
is
the
risk
we
all
took.
In
the
gathering
dark,
It
works
hard
now
to
find
its
way
back
Men,
who
are
so
easily
seduced
The
young
captain
of
Gondor
...take
the
Ring
for
his
own,
It
is
close
now.
So
close
to
achieving
its
goal.

For
Sauron
will
have
dominion
...even
unto
to
the
ending
The
time
of
the
Elves...
...is
over.
Do
we
leave
Middle-earth
to
its
fate?
Do
we
let
them
stand
alone?
What
news?
Our
scouts
report
Saruman
Théoden's
people
have
fled
But
we
must
look
to
our
own
borders.
Sauron
is
marshaling
an
army.
Easterlings
and
Southrons
-
How
many?
-
Who's
covering
the
river
to
the
north?
If
their
city
is
attacked,
we
won't
hold
it.
FARAMIR:
Sauron
from
Mordor.
The
fight
will
come
to
Men
Gondor
is
weak.
Sauron
will
strike
us
soon.
And
he
will
strike
hard.
He
knows
now
we
do
not
have
My
men
tell
me
that
you
are
Orc
spies.
Spies?
Now
wait
just
a
minute.
Well,
if
you're
not
spies,
Speak.
We
are
Hobbits
of
the
Shire.
Frodo
Baggins
is
my
name,
Your
bodyguard?
His
gardener.
And
where
is
your
skulking
friend?
That
gangrel
creature.
He
had
an
ill-favored
look.
There
was
no
other.
We
set
out
from
Rivendell
One
we
lost
in
Moria...
...two
were
my
kin...
...a
Dwarf
there
was
also.
Aragorn,
son
of
Arathorn,
You're
a
friend
of
Boromir?
Yes.
For
my
part.
It
will
grieve
you
then
to
learn
Dead?
How?
When?
As
one
of
his
companions,
He
was
my
brother.
MAN:


You
must
come
with
me.
Now.
Down
there.
To
enter
the
Forbidden
Pool
They
wait
for
my
command.
Shall
I
shoot?
The
rock
and
pool
So
juicy
sweet
Our
only
wish
So
juicy
sweet

Wait.
This
creature
is
bound
to
me.
And
I
to
him.
He
is
our
guide.
Please...
...let
me
go
down
to
him.
Sméagol.
Master
is
here.
Come,
Sméagol.
Trust
master.
Come.
We
must
go
now?
Sméagol,
you
must
trust
master.
Follow
me.
Come
on.
Come.
Come,
Sméagol.
Nice
Sméagol.
That's
it.
Come
on.

Don't
hurt
him!
Sméagol,
don't
struggle.
Master!

No!
No!

Where
are
you
leading
them?

FARAMIR:
GOLLUM:

Why
does
it
cry,
Sméagol?
SMÉAGOL:
Master
tricksed
us.
GOLLUM:
I
told
you
he
was
tricksy.
I
told
you
he
was
false.
SMÉAGOL:
Our
friend.
GOLLUM:
SMÉAGOL:
Leave
us
alone!
GOLLUM:
They
stole
it
from
us!
SMÉAGOL:
What
did
they
steal?
GOLLUM:

We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
You
go.
Go,
now.
You
can
do
it.
Use
the
Ring,
Mr.
Frodo.
Just
this
once.
Put
it
on.
Disappear.
I
can't.
You
were
right,
Sam.
You
tried
to
tell
me
but...
I'm
sorry.
The
Ring's
taking
me,
Sam.
If
I
put
it
on...
...he'll
find
me.
He'll
see.
Mr.
Frodo...
So
this
is
the
answer
Here
in
the
Wild
I
have
you...
...two
Halflings...
...and
a
host
of
men
at
my
call.
The
Ring
of
Power
within
my
grasp.
A
chance
for
Faramir,
...to
show
his
quality.

No!
Stop
it!
Leave
him
alone.
Don't
you
understand?
He's
got
to
destroy
it!
That's
where
we're
going,
into
Mordor.
To
the
Mountain
of
Fire!
Osgiliath
is
under
attack.
SAM:
Will
you
not
help
him?
Captain?
Prepare
to
leave.
The
Ring
will
go
to
Gondor.


WOMAN:
He's
alive!
Get
out
of
the
way!
You
are
the
luckiest,
the
canniest...
...and
the
most
reckless
man
Bless
you,
laddie.
Gimli,
where
is
the
king?




A
great
host,
you
say?
-
All
Isengard
is
emptied.
ARAGORN:
Ten
thousand?
It
is
an
army
bred
for
a
single
purpose:
To
destroy
the
world
of
Men.
They
will
be
here
by
nightfall.
Let
them
come!
I
want
every
man
and
strong
lad
...to
be
ready
for
battle
by
nightfall.
We
will
cover
the
causeway
No
army
has
ever
breached
...or
set
foot
inside
the
Hornburg!
This
is
no
rabble
of
mindless
Orcs.
These
are
Uruk-hai.
Their
armor
is
thick
I
have
fought
many
wars,
Master
Dwarf.
I
know
how
to
defend
my
own
keep.
They
will
break
upon
this
fortress
Saruman's
hordes
will
pillage
and
burn.
Crops
can
be
resown...
...homes
rebuilt.
Within
these
walls...
...we
will
outlast
them.
They
do
not
come
to
destroy
Rohan's
They
come
to
destroy
its
people...
...down
to
the
last
child.
What
would
you
have
me
do?
Look
at
my
men.
Their
courage
hangs
by
a
thread.
If
this
is
to
be
our
end,
then
I
would
...as
to
be
worthy
of
remembrance.
ARAGORN:
You
must
call
for
aid.
And
who
will
come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We
are
not
so
lucky
in
our
friends
The
old
alliances
are
dead.
-
Gondor
will
answer.
Where
was
Gondor
Where
was
Gondor
when
Where
was
Gon...?
No,
my
Lord
Aragorn...
...we
are
alone.
Get
the
women
and
children
MAN
1:
We
need
more
time
THÉODEN:
MAN
2:

We
Ents
have
not
troubled...
...about
the
wars
of
Men
and
wizards...
...for
a
very
long
time.
But
now,
something
...that
has
not
happened...
...for
an
age.
Entmoot.
What's
that?
'Tis
a
gathering.
A
gathering
of
what?

TREEBEARD:
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many
have
come.
Now
we
must
decide
if
the
Ents...
...will
go
to
war.
GUARD
1:
GUARD
1:
Keep
moving.



Farmers,
farriers,
stable
boys.
These
are
no
soldiers.
-
Most
have
seen
too
many
winters.
Look
at
them.
They're
frightened.
You
can
see
it
in
their
eyes.

Aragorn.

GIMLl:
Let
him

Who
am
I,

You
are
our
king,

And
do
you
trust
your
king?
Your
men,
my
lord...
...will
follow
you
to
whatever
end.
To
whatever
end.
Where
is
the
horse
and
the
rider?
Where
is
the
horn
that
was
blowing?
They
have
passed
like
rain
Like
wind
in
the
meadow.
The
days
have
gone
down
in
the
West...
...behind
the
hills...
...into
Shadow.
How
did
it
come
to
this?
GUARD:
Give
me
your
sword.
What
is
your
name?
Haleth,
son
of
Háma,
my
lord.
The
men
are
saying
that
They
say
that
it
is
hopeless.
This
is
a
good
sword.
Haleth,
son
of
Háma...
...there
is
always
hope.
We
have
trusted
you
this
far.
Forgive
me.
I
was
wrong
to
despair.

We
had
time,
I'd
get
this
adjusted.
It's
a
little
tight
across
the
chest.

That
is
no
Orc
horn.
Send
for
the
king.
-
Open
the
gate!
How
is
this
possible?
I
bring
word
from
Elrond
of
Rivendell.
An
alliance
once
existed
Long
ago
we
fought
and
died
together.
We
come
to
honor
that
allegiance.

You
are
most
welcome.
We
are
proud
to
fight

[INDISTINCT

GIMLl:
Well,
lad,
whatever
luck
you
live
by,

Your
friends
are
with
you,
Aragorn.
Let's
hope
they
last
the
night.



ARAGORN
:

-
What's
happening
out
there?
Or
would
you
like
me
to
find
you
a
box?



So
it
begins.

Did
they
hit
anything?
Give
them
a
volley.
-
Fire!

Send
them
to
me!
Come
on!

Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two
already!
I'm
on
17!
Huh?
I'll
have
no
pointy-ear
Nineteen!

Merry.
We
have
just
agreed.
Yes?
I
have
told
your
names
to
the
Entmoot...
...and
we
have
agreed...
...you
are
not
Orcs.
Well,
that's
good
news.
And
what
about
Saruman?
Now,
don't
be
hasty,
Master
Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our
friends
are
out
there.
They
need
our
help.
They
cannot
War?
Yes.
It
affects
us
all.
But
you
must
understand,
young
Hobbit...
...it
takes
a
long
time...
...to
say
anything
in
Old
Entish...
...and
we
never
say
anything...
...unless
it
is
worth
taking...
...a
long
time
to
say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two
and
23!
Causeway!

Is
this
it?
Is
this
all
you
can
conjure,
Saruman?

Brace
the
gate!
Hold
them!
Stand
firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!

The
Ents
cannot
hold
back
this
storm.
We
must
weather
such
things
How
can
that
be
your
decision?!
This
is
not
our
war.
But
you're
part
of
this
world!
Aren't
you?!

You
must
help.
Please.
You
must
do
something.
You
are
young
and
brave,
Master
Merry.
But
your
part
in
this
tale
is
over.
Go
back
to
your
home.
Maybe
Treebeard's
right.
We
don't
belong
here,
Merry.
It's
too
big
for
us.
What
can
we
do
in
the
end?
We've
got
the
Shire.
Maybe
we
should
go
home.
The
fires
of
Isengard
will
spread...
...and
the
woods
of
Tuckborough
And...
And
all
that
was
once
green
and
good
There
won't
be
a
Shire,
Pippin.
GAMLING:
Fall
back
to
the
Keep!
Get
your

out

there!

What
are
you
doing?

Hold

To
the

Draw
your

We
cannot
hold
much
longer!

As
long
as
you
can
give
me.

Oh,
come
on.
We
can
take
them.
It's
a
long
way.
Toss
me.
-
What?
You'll
have
to
toss
me!

Don't
tell
the

Not

is

Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall
back!
ARAGORN:
THÉODEN:
I
will
leave
you
at
the
western
borders
You
can
make
your
way
north
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn
around.
-
Turn
around.
Take
us
south.
But
that
will
lead
you
past
Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If
we
go
south,
we
can
slip
The
closer
we
are
to
danger,
It's
the
last
thing
he'll
expect.
That
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
But
then...
...you
are
very
small.
Perhaps
you're
right.
South
it
is,
then.
Hold
on,
little
Shirelings.
I
always
like
going
south.
Somehow
it
feels
like
going
downhill.
Are
you
mad?
We'll
be
caught.
No,
we
won't.
Not
this
time.
MAN:
Osgiliath
burns!
Mordor
has
come.
The
Ring
will
not
save
Gondor.
It

only
the
power
to
destroy.
Please...
...let
me
go.
Hurry.

You
must
let
me
go!

somewhere

Many
of

were

had
known
I'm
sorry,

They
had

own.

should
know
better!

is

is

tonight...

AND

our
doom.
Last

have
taken
the

shore.
By
nightfall

It's
calling

Sam.
Hold
on,
Mr.
Frodo.
You'll
be
all
right.

Take
them
to

is

Release
the
river!
Pippin!
Hold
on!
Hold
on,
little
Hobbits.
What
are
you
doing?
Where
are
you
going?


It's
me.
It's
your
Sam.
Don't
you
know
your
Sam?


I
can't
do
this,
Sam.
I
know.
It's
all
wrong.
By
rights,
we
shouldn't
even
be
here.
But
we
are.
It's
like
in
the
great
stories,
Mr.
Frodo.
The
ones
that
really
mattered.
Full
of
darkness
and
danger
they
were.
And
sometimes
you
didn't
want
...because
how
could
the
end
be
happy?
How
could
the
world
go
back
...when
so
much
bad
had
happened?
Victory!
We
have
victory!
SAM:
But
in
the
end,
...this
shadow.
Even
darkness
must
pass.
A
new
day
will
come.
And
when
the
sun
shines,
Those
were
the
stories
...that
meant
something.
Even
if
you
were
too
small
But
I
think,
Mr.
Frodo,
I
do
understand.
I
know
now.
Folk
in
those
stories...
...had
lots
of
chances
of
turning
back,
They
kept
going...
...because
they
were
holding
What
are
we
holding
on
to,
Sam?
That
there's
some
good
And
it's
worth
fighting
for.
I
think
at
last
we
understand
one
another,
You
know
the
laws
of
our
country,
If
you
let
them
go,
Then
it
is
forfeit.
Release
them.
Sauron's
wrath
will
be
terrible,

The
battle
for
Helm's
Deep
is
over.
The
battle
for
Middle-earth
All
our
hopes
now
lie
...somewhere
in
the
wilderness.
I
wonder
if
we'll
ever
be
What?
I
wonder
if
people
will
ever
say,
And
they'll
say,
"Frodo
was
really
courageous,
"Yes,
my
boy.
The
most
famousest
of
Hobbits.
Well,
you've
left
out

the
Brave."
I
want
to
hear
more
about
Sam.

wouldn't
have
got
far

Mr.
Frodo,
you
shouldn't
make
fun.

was
I.

Brave."

not
going

looks
after

wouldn't

poor

betrayed
us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We
ought
to
wring
Kill
him!
Kill
him!
Kill
them
both!
And
then
we
take
the
precious...
...and
we
be
the
master!
But
the
fat
Hobbit,
he
knows.
Eyes
always
watching.
Then
we
stabs
them
out.
Put
out
his
eyeses

Yes.
Yes.
Kill
them
both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's
too
risky.
It's
too
risky.
SAM:
-
Hey,
Gollum!
Where
are
you?
We
could
let
her
do
it.
Yes.
She
could
do
it.
Yes,
precious,
she
could.
And
then
we
takes
it
Once
they're
dead.
Shh.
Come
on,
Hobbits.
Long
ways
to
go
yet.
Sméagol
will
show
you
the
way.
Follow
me.
