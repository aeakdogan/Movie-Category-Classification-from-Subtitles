TARS:
Mars,
so
you
name
it,
The
Red
Planet.
No
air,
no
life.
But
you
do
not
know
Mars,
And
it
is
not
airless,
nor
is
it
dead,
but
it
is
dying.
The
city
of
Zodanga
saw
to
that.
Zodanga,
the
predator
city,
moving,
devouring,
draining
Barsoom
of
energy
and
life.
Only
the
great
city
of
Helium
matched
Zodanga
airship
for
airship,
holding
fast
for
a
thousand
years.
Until
one
day
the
ruler
of
Zodanga
became
cornered
in
a
sandstorm.
And
everything
changed.

I
need
clean
lights!
Full
loft,
aye!

Full
loft!
Intensity
full!

Hard
turn!
Come
about!
No
time!
Hard
turn
now!

There!
-
Shadow!

Death
to
Helium!

Being
a
fool
is
a
great
luxury,
Sab
Than.
Get
up.
Who...
What
are
you?
We
serve
the
Goddess.
And
she
has
chosen
you
Do
as
we
command
With
none
to
defy
you.
And
nothing
to
stand
in
your
way.

sad
tidings.
Mr.
Burroughs,
Noah
Dalton,
My
deepest
sympathies.
His
death
came
as
a
shock
to
all
of
us.
He
was
a
model
of
health
and
vigor.
He
just
dropped
dead
in
his
study
not
five
minutes
after
sending
When
I
arrived
he
was
already
gone.
The
man
never
stopped
digging.
All
over
the
world.
No
soon
he
started
digging
one
hole
or
the
Orkney
Islands
to
dig
another.
He
said
it
was
pure
research,
but
it
always
seemed
to
me
Oh,
and
God
grant
me
Every
inch
a
cavalry
man,
Mother
always
said
that
Jack
That
it
was
only
his
body
He
used
to
tell
me
I'd
like
to
pay
my
respects.
DALTON:
You
won't
find
a
keyhole.
Thing
only
opens
from
the
inside.
He
insisted.
No
embalming,
You
don't
acquire
the
kind
of
by
being
like
the
rest
of
us.
Come.
Let's
go
inside.
"And
lastly,
I
hereby
direct"
"that
my
estate
"the

to
benefit
"Edgar
Rice
Burroughs,"
"at
the
end

term
"In

Of
course
I
always
adored
Why
me?
He
never
offered
an
explanation,
It
was
his
private
journal.
He
was
most
explicit
that
you,
and
only
you,
would
read
its
contents.
Now,
you
might
possibly
find
I'll
leave
you
now.
Again,
my
condolences.
JOHN:
My
dear
Edgar,
I
remember
how
and
tell
you
wild
tales,
which
you
always
Now
you
are
grown.
Time
and
space
have
parted
us,
but
I
reach
out
across
that
distance
to
that
same
wide-eyed
boy
and
ask
him
to
believe
me
once
more.
This
wild
tale
begins
13
years
ago
in
the
Arizona
Territory
between
the
Pinale√±o
Mountains
and
the
backside
of

Ah.
Coming

No
more,
Carter.
Is
there
a
problem,
Mr.
Dix?
-
Yes,
you're
a
goddamn
loon!
I
done
took
all
your
money,
Carter.
Your

I'll

You're

Now
get
on
home.
MAN
1:
Now,
I
do
believe
he
done
told
you
to
get
on
out
of
here.
I'll
leave

these

are
full.
I
found
that

Your

I

you

Do

we
are
up
to
Ain't
my

I
believe
it
is
your
concern,
Captain.
Folks
are
being
attacked
You
started
it.
You
finish
it.
You've
gone
native,
have
you?
Apaches
can
go
to
hell,
too.
We're
nothing
but
a
warring
species,
You're
a

That
makes
you
valuable

sir,
whatever
it
is
you
suppose
I
owe
you,
our
country
or
any
other
beloved
cause,
I
have
already
paid.
I
have
paid
in
full,
sir.
So
let
me
tell
you
what
I
will
do.
I
will
break
me
out
of
this
cell.
I
will
claim
my
gold
and
get
filthy
rich.
Rich
enough
to
buy
your
flat,
just
so
I
can
kick
it
all
day
long.

Captain,
I'm
finding
it
difficult
to
with
the
one
I'm
looking
at.
I

The

What

Don't
shoot

Don't
shoot!
Don't
shoot

We
should
kill
it,
Jeddak.
Move
away.

Hello.
Don't

Don't
run
away.
Hello.
Don't

Alright.
Alright.
All

Don't

Don't

What
is
this

Where
am
I?

It's
alright,
Virginia.
Be
still.
Where's
my
damn
gold?

Eighteen
have
yet
to
hatch,
Jeddak.
Then
they
are
weak
and
not
Thark.
Leave
nothing
for
the
white
apes.



Barsoom,
a
world
on
the
brink.
For
Zodanga's
new
power
And
if
Helium
falls,
so
does
Barsoom.
Rubbish.
Goddess,
help
me,
I'm
hopeless.
I
always
come
on
too
strong.
Your
Highness.
My
Jeddak.
My
Jeddak.
After
years
of
tireless
research,
the
answer.
I
hope.

My
Jeddak,
after
years
of...
I'm
sorry,
Princess.
The
presentation
will
have
to
wait.
-
Father,
what's
happened?

I
know
the
terms
set
by
Sab
Than.
What
I
want
to
know
Admiral
Kantos
Kan.
The
eastern
border
is
a
wasteland.
Sab
Than
has
burned
and
the
border
folk
will
be
massacred.
Our
best
troops
and
fleetest
ships
are
proven
less
than
useless
and
now
comes
word
that
has
been
lost.
Helium
is
lost.
My
people.
I
have
failed
them
all.
DEJAH:
No,
my
Jeddak,
you
haven't!
Forgive
me,
my
lady,
It
radiates
the
most
intense,
baleful
blue
light.
When
I
read
our
reports
Somehow
that
idiotic
brute
Discovered
what?
The
Ninth
Ray.
Unlimited
power.
Sab
Than
only
uses
it
for
slaughter.
But
think
of
what
Helium
might
Transform
the
deserts,
restore
the
seas.
Is
this
what
you
saw,
Kantos?
It's
starting
to
look
very
close.
Give
it
time.
It
Will
work.

(NINTH
RAY
CLATTERS
TARDOS:
Everyone,
leave
us.
Dejah,
ever
since
you
were
a
little
girl,
you've
always
met
the
expectations
It's
Sab's
terms.
What
are
they?
He
will
spare
Helium
if
you
accept
his
hand
in
marriage.
No!
He
is
a
monster!
You
must
refuse
him!
He's
already
on
his
way
here.
But
all
of
my
work...
I
just
need
a
little
more
time.
-
Dejah!
You
can't
just
bow
down
to
Zodanga!
A
wedding
will
save
the
city.
Perhaps,
but
it
could
lose
you
Barsoom.
Dejah!
With
no
one
to
stop
Zodanga,
-
We
do
not
have
the
luxury...
You
must
find
another
way!
There
is
no
other
way!
If
there
were,
This
is
the
chance
we
have
been
given.
Perhaps
it
is
the
will
of
the
Goddess.
No.
It
is
your
will.
So,
when
I
was
little,
and
you
would
tell
me
of
the
heroes
how
there
was
a
star
up
there
for
me,
is
this
what
you
imagined
My
Jeddak.
Sab
Than's
corsair
approaches
the
city.
They
signal
for
permission
to
land.
Granted.
And
let
us
prepare
ourselves
I
have
destroyed
the
device,
She
was
on
the
verge
of
discovery.
All
is
in
place.
Keep
close
watch
over
her.
We
don't
want
anything
to
interfere






Sarkoja!
Let
Sola
have
a
hatchling.


Sola
can
take
the
little
white
worm.
Be
still.
Let
go!
Be
still!
What
happened
to
you?

Be
still.

we
kill
it.
Step
away,

Hajus.
You
prize
this
more
Step...
...away.
I
claim
the
right
of
challenge!
And
who
supports
your
challenge?

Who
will
pledge
their

to

You
are
blind
as
a

You
will
not

Not
today.
See
the

your

has
found!
Is
it...
a

ape?
No!
It
is
a
rare
and
valuable

It
is
called...
It
is
called...
Virginia!

Virginia!

Watch.
Everyone,
step
back.
Show
them,
Virginia.
Jump.
Jump!

By
Issus,
you
will
jump
tomorrow,
Virginia.
Sola,
chain
him.
Tell
Sarkoja
to
initiate
him
Wait,
wait,
wait!




I
know.
I
know...
Drink...
Good...

What's
in
that
stuff?

The
voice
of
Barsoom.
(SPEAKING
BOTH
ALIEN

You
can
hear
it
if
you
choose.



Easy.
Nice
monster

How
the

did
you...

Quit
it!





Stop
it!
You
killed
him
with
one
blow.
I...
Wait.
I
understood
you.

What
have
you
done?
Get
off!

Get
Off

did

Enough!
There
is
no
room
Your
next
offense
will
be
your
last.
You
will
jump,
Virginia.
Now.
Jeddak!
Fliers!
You
are
the
stones,
the
sand!

Sir,
they
continue
to
ignore
our
signals.
Enough!
I've
been
patient.
Let
them
die!
If
that's
how
you
plan
it's
no
wonder
she
ran
from
you.

Thoris
must
live.

You
need
only
cripple
the

Quick,
clean,

Jeddak,
shall
we
destroy
her?
No.
We
need
only
cripple
her.
Now
bring
us
around.

-
Helium.
Helium.
Zodanga.
They
are
the
red

Zodanga's
winning
the
war,
but
I
say
let
red

kill
red
men

That
don't
look
like
a
fair
fight.
Zodanga
never
fights
fair.
Where
is
she?
My
Jeddak,
that's
all
of
them.
She
can't
have
just
-
Check
the
dead.
Then
check
them
again.

To
the
bridge,
now!


Look
out!


She's
a
human!

Sola!
Who
is
that?
I
bet
Virginia.
Beg
your
pardon,
ma'am.
If
you'll
kindly
just
stand
behind
me.
This
might
get
dangerous.
Or
maybe
I
ought
to
get
behind
you.
You
let
me
know
No.
Take
him
alive.
What's
the
point
of
having
this

Leave

is

shameful

is
taken
up
You
made
a
difference
today,
Virginia.
Okay.
See,
my
name
is
John
Carter.
Virginia
is
where
I'm
from.
Where
did
you
learn
to
jump
that
way?
I
don't
know.
How'd
you
learn
to

cannot
sail
No,

sail

of

for
me.
There
will
be
time
for
playfulness
later.
I
want
no
playfulness
from
him.
I
want
his
help.
Explain
to
me
how
you
do
it.
If
it's
a
skill,
teach
it
to
Helium.
-
Name
your
price.
I've
got
a
cave
of
gold
of
my
own.
Somewhere.
Only
a
madman
would
rave
Is
that
your
expert
view?
-
I'm
mad?
She
is
a
good
match
for
you,
Don't
call
me
that.
There
are
no

You
said

I'm
on

So,
now

is

you
came
on
one
across

No.
Not
like
that.
Go
on,
shock
me.
How?
That
brought
me
here.
Oh.
Well,
that
explains
everything,
then.
-
It
does?
You're
a
Thern
and
you
simply
Isn't
that
it?
Yes.
Then
let's
sort
this
out
right
now.
Come
along!

Where
are
you
going?

No.
No,

There

Iss"
"and
find
everlasting
peace"
"in
the
bosom
of
Issus."
JOHN:
The
Gates
of
Iss.
What
if
I
could
take
you
there?
What
if
I
didn't
trust
you?
Then
we'd
be
even.
I
can
take
you
to
the
Gates,
A
way
back
to
Jasoom.
-
Earth.
It's
the
least
I
could
do
Assuming
that
you
can.
Deal.
Go
on.
You
shake
it.
As
a
sign
of
trust.
Good
enough.
Now
all
I
need
to
do
Dotar
Sojat?

Useless
she-calot.

I
told
you.
It
is
forbidden.


What
in
the
name
of
Issus
is
going
on?
Issus
has
been
profaned.
We
found
this
one
and
the
red
wench
In
the
temple?
How
did
they
get...
Sola
led
them
there.
Sola
tried
to
stop
us.
I
meant
no
disrespect
I'm
just
trying
to
get
home.
Your
right
arms
were
planning
and
use
it
to
commit
greater
blasphemy
They
must
all
die
in
the
arena.
How
could
you
do
this?
I
made
you
Dotar
Sojat
You
knew...
You
knew
Now
Sola
will
die
because
of
you.
She's
your
daughter,
isn't
she?

Who
told
you
that?
Call
it
a
father's
intuition.
A
Thark
has
no
parent
but
the
horde.
But
how
do
you
know?
Her
mother
kept
her
egg
and
Sola's
the
last
flicker
You
can't
just
stand
here
Argh!
My
right
arms
offend
me.
I
Will
cut
them
Off.
No.
You
must
hurry.
I
mean
to
release
you.
I
make
one
condition.
You
take
Sola
with
you
My
Jeddak.
I'd
rather
you
died
than
as
food
Where
you
go,
she
goes.
What's
gonna
happen
to
you,
Tars?
Leave
a
Thark
his
head
and
one
hand
Is
it
done,
my
Jeddak?
Tars
Tarkas
betrays
us.
JOHN:
Woola!
You
belong
to
him.
Woola
would
follow
you
DEJAH:
It's
three
days'
ride.
Follow
me.
JOHN:
What
happened
to
this
place?
DEJAH:
Zodanga
happened.
Sailing
on
light.
Still
playing
the
madman?
Or
the
liar.
DEJAH:
Keep
moving!
We'll
get
there!
SAB
THAN:
Why
pursue
this
wedding
Not
yet.
You
must
aim
past
the
horizon,
To
truly
demoralize
a
nation
requires
a
Staging
this
wedding
will
ensure
If
you
insist.
If
you
cannot
see
the
wisdom
in
that,
Dotar
Sojat.
Carter!
I
do
not
think
she
leads
us
to
the
Iss.
All
right,
then,
Sola.
Just
play
along.

What
do
you
think
I'd
do
-
What
do
you
mean?
They
should
be
at
our
backs
by
now.
You
lead
us
toward
Helium!
Once
we
reach
there,
you
would
see
for
yourself

Everyone
thinks
DEJAH:
What
are
you
doing?

No!
John
Carter!
You
can't!
I
like
this
plan
better.
Just
wait.
She'll
come
around.
You
mad
fool!
You're
not
from
Earth!
I
only
told
you
what
you
wanted
to
hear
Stop!
I
can't!
I
cannot
marry
him!
Can't
marry
who?
The
Zodangan
Jeddak
you
fought.
Sab
Than.
He
offered
a
truce
to
my
father
Your
father?
Tardos
Mors.
The
Jeddak
of
Helium.
A
princess
of
Mars.
How
about
that?
A
princess
who
didn't
want
No.
Is
that
all
there
is
to
the
story?
No,
I
didn't
run
away!
-
I
escaped!
So
marry
the
guy
and
save
your
people.
A
life
of
oppression!
That's
not
living!
If
you
had
the
means
to
save
others,
would
you
not
take
No
good
will
come
I
would
lay
down
my
life
for
Helium.
Yes,
I
ran
away.
I
was
afraid,
weak.
Maybe
I
should
have
married.
But
I
so
feared
that
it
would
somehow
I
tell
you
truly,
John
Carter
of
Earth,
there
are
no
Gates
of
Iss.
They
are
not
real.
I'm
sorry,
Princess.
But
this,
this
is
real.
And
so
is
my
cave
of
gold.
Prudence
demands
you
take
an
escort.
No.
I
go
alone,
General.
But,
Jeddak...
In
one
sweep,
I
can
and
bring
Helium
to
its
knees
forever.
But
my
general,
in
his
superior
wisdom,
I'm
starting
to
talk
like
you.
THERN
1:
It
took
them
longer
than
I
thought.
THERN
2:
If
they
reach
the
Gates...
THERN
3:
THERN
4:
Her
knowledge
MATAI:
As
advanced
as
it
will
ever
be.
Patience,
brothers.
It
is
under
my
control.
I'm
already
there.
SOLA:
The
Iss.
Here,
pilgrims
must
leave
all
they
know,
never
to
return.
May
the
Goddess
find
me
worthy.
Wait!
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
It
is
my
way,
Dotar
Sojat,
not
yours.
I
must
honor
my
Jeddak
You
want
to
honor
your
father?

My
father?
Sola...
Why
would
you
say
that?
That's
what
drives
your
compassion,
the
blood
of
your
father,
Tars
Tarkas.
And
of
all
the
Tharks,
Your
duty
to
your
father
Just
help
me
find
the
Gates.
Then
you
can
decide
Just
to
the
Gates,
then.
Woola,
stay!


Other
pilgrims.
Professor.

Impossible.
I've
never
seen
JOHN:
I
want
to
get
a
better
look.

Carter,
your
feet.


This
is
not
the
work
of
gods.
These
are
machines.
Your
medallion.
A
spider.
Nine.
Nine
rays.
Nine.
The
Ninth
Ray
is
real.
It
can
be
harnessed.
Do
you
see?
This
entire
structure
runs
Mother
Issus!
Such
power.
And
somehow
Zodanga
has
it.
The
Therns.
They
must
be
real.
And
you
are
John
Carter
of
Earth?
Yes,
ma'am.
And
the
ships
that
sail
on
the
sea.
You've
seen
them.
That
must
be
a
beautiful
sight.
It
truly
is.

It's
our
solar
system.
-
What's
it
say?
What
do
you
think
it
says?
It
appears
to
be
Here
is
Barsoom.
There
is
Jasoom.
This
glyph
here,
it's
like
our
symbol
sent
along
these
lines
here,
Like...
A
telegram.
You're
saying
I
was
telegraphed
here.
I'm
a
copy
of
myself.
Possibly,
making
these
words
I
don't
like
guessing.
I
need
more
information.
Right.
And
where
might
we
find
those?
In
the
Hall
of
Science.
And
where's
that?
Helium.
Then
quick,
let's
just
head
on
What
do
you
take
me
for?
I
take
you
for
a
man
who's
lost.
I
won't
be
lost
if
you
just
tell
me
I
will!
But
everything
I
need
to
understand
I'm
trying
to
get
you
back
Isn't
that
what
you
want?
Yes.
No.
I
don't
believe
you.
We
may
have
been
born
worlds
apart,
but
I
know
you,
John
Carter.
From
the
moment
I
felt
the
heart
of
a
man
a
man
willing
to
fight
for
a
cause.
Here.
On
Barsoom.
Don't
you
see,
Carter?
I
fled
to
find
another
way.
You
are
the
other
way.

SOLA:
Dotar
Sojat!
SOLA:
Warhoon!


Dotar
Sojat!
Pursue
them
to
the
Aoolian
Plain.
Then
overtake
them
The
one
who
jumps?
Let's
see
what
he's
capable
of.



Sarah!
-
Whoa!
-
What
are
you
doing?

Carter!
I
was
too
late
once.
I
won't
be
again.
No!
No!

No!
No!
Woola,
go.
Go,
damn
you!


Father!
Thank
the
Goddess!
Carter.
Oh,
thank
Issus.
TARDOS:
Who
is
he?
His
name's
John
Carter.
He's
from
Jasoom.

Jasoom!
Zodanga's
closer.
He
shot
me
out
of
the
sky!
Daughter,
listen
to
me!
Listen.
Sab
has
admitted
to
everything.
He
came
to
me,
alone,
I
could
have
had
him
imprisoned.
I
could
have
had
him
killed.
Yet,
it
was
clear
he
only
cared
I
feared
you'd
be
tortured
by
the
Tharks
I
could
not
live
with
that
I
do
have
one,
Princess.
Really?
I
thought
you
had
it
She
does
not
trust
me,
Jeddak.
And
why
should
she?
There's
never
been
trust
Therefore,
Princess,
I
offer
you
this
small
My
life.

You
hold
the
power,
Princess.
The
power
of
life
over
me
With
our
two
cities
united,
All
you
have
to
do
is
marry
me.
Is
this
Helium?

No.

Ah,
Zodanga,
where
the
men
and
the
women
are
as
hard
as
the
beds.
What's
your
business
here?
He
is
my
business.
The
Jasoomian
is
to
be
taken
We've
received
no
such
orders!
You're
receiving
them
now!
Straight
from
the
laughing
lips
I
hear
that
you

Take
me
hostage.
-
What?
Are
you
all
right?

No!
The
white
imbecile
Guards!
Carter!
Run!
There's
a
crazy
man
Carter,
this
way!
Right,
your
turn.
-
My
turn?
-
Who
are
you?
I
serve
Princess
Dejah.
-
Dejah?
And
from
what
she
tells
me,
She
said
I
could
make
that?
We
could
always
surrender.
Quickly!
Is
that
what
you
do
on
Jasoom?
Come
on!


Hello,
ladies.

You
are
expected
Bow.
I
suppose
that
will
do.
I
fetched
him,
as
you
commanded.
Thank
you,
Kantos.
I
wish
to
speak
to
Captain
Carter
alone.
Keep
watch
outside.
Now,
girls.
Off
you
go!

You
look
beautiful.
It's
traditional
Zodangan,
worn
by
the
groom's
mother,
I'm
told.
A
little
vulgar
for
my
taste,
but
my
opinions
You
can't
seriously
be
considering
this.
-
What
other
choice
do
I
have?
Give
me
a
reason
not
to.
Will
you
stay
and
fight
for
Helium?
Will
you
stay
and
fight
for
Helium?
Dejah.
We
have
a
saying
on
Barsoom.
A
warrior
may
change
his
metal,
You
were
right.
I
could
decipher
the
command.
It's
a
set
of
sounds.
A
simple
phrase.
Repeat
after
me.
Ock,
ohem,
ocktei...
SAB
THAN:
Open
the
door!
Say
it
now.
Ock,
ohem,
ocktei.

Ock,
ohem,
ocktei.
Wies.
-
Wies.
Jasoom.
Say
it.
-
Say
it.
Say
it!
Dejah?
Are
you
alone?
Yes.
I
am
alone.
Well,
my
Jeddak.
The
moons
will
soon
be
rising.
Let
us
not
delay
Yes.
Yes,
of
course.
Ssh.
We'll
have
plenty
of
time
to
talk.
Now.

Who
are
you?
-
American.
"Sir."
Definitely
the
South.
The
Carolinas?
Virginia?
It's
Virginia,
isn't
it?
-
Lovely
place.
Not
as
well
as
I
should.
But
I
will.
Padwar,
what's
the
hold-up?
Sorry,
sir.
The
streets
are
blocked.
It's
the
wedding
procession.
Increased
strength
and
agility.
Simple
matter
one
we
ought
to
have
foreseen.
We?
No
apparent
increase
in
intelligence.
Still,
this
Will
not
do
at
all.
We
can't
have
Earthmen
leaping
about,
causing
You're
a
Thern.
Therns
are
a
myth.
Padwar,
we'll
go
on
foot.
Yes,
sir.
My
name
is
Matai
Shang,
Indeed,
I
work
very
hard
at
it.

Excuse
me,
excuse
me.
Many
pardons,
many
pardons.
It's
a
shame,
really.
She's
a
remarkable
creature,
You
mean
the
Ninth
Ray.
It's
of
no
consequence
now.
After
tonight's
ceremony,
when
the
two
moons
meet
she
and
anyone
else
with
will
be
eliminated.
In
effect,
cutting
the
head
off
the
beast.
Quick,
clean
and
precise.

Shame
there's
no
one
to
warn
her.

The
balance
must
be
restored.

What
gives
you
the
right
to
interfere?
What
do
you
care?
You
have
no
obligation
to
these
people.
You
don't
have
a
dog
in
this
fight.
Is
that
how
you
would
say
it
in
Virginia?
Man
without
a
cause.
So
what
is
your
cause?
We
have
none.
We're
not
haunted
by
mortality
We
are
eternal.
I
don't
understand.
The
wedding,
this
little
stroll.
Why
not
just
kill
me,
kill
Dejah?
History
will
follow
And
we've
chosen
The
Ninth
Ray
of
mindless
brutes
we
can
control.
And
the
infamy
of
Dejah
Thoris's
We've
been
playing
this
game
And
we'll
continue
to
do
so,
We
don't
cause
the
destruction
We
simply
manage
it,
feed
off
it,
if
you
like.
But
on
every
host
planet,
it
always
Populations
rise,
societies
divide,
wars
spread.
And
all
the
while
the
neglected
planet
slowly
fades.
Prep
a
two-man
flier
immediately
Yes,
sir.
Argh!
Immortal
ain't
bulletproof.
I
shot
one
of
you
back
on
Earth.
Oh,
come
on.
I'm
trying!
I'm
Wing!
Guards!
After
him!




Ohh,
Woola!
I
told
you
Woola
would
He
did
a
lot
more
than
just
that.
Wait!
Wait!
Where
are
you
going?
To
save
Dejah.
And
I'll
need
an
army
to
do
it.
Get
on.
No!
Tharks
do
not
fly.


Gayor.
Tars!
They're
going
to
kill
Dejah.
Issus
truly
rewards
the
just.



-
I
see
the
dead.
The
Virginia
I
knew
traveled
the
Iss.
What
have
they
done
to
you?
Tal
challenged.
I
lost.
Virginia.
When
I
saw
you
leap
into
the
sky,
I
wished
to
believe
it
was
a
sign
that
something
new
that
the
greatness
of
our
Thark
race
But
it
is
too
late.

-
Tars.
My
daughter
is
with
There
is
comfort
in
that.
Tars,
it's
Sola.
Actually,
she's
here
with
me.
Argh!

This
is
how
you
repay
your
debt
to
me?
I
need
my
sword.
Then
it
would
harvest



Up
now!
We
go!
It
is
done.
Nonsense.
"Leave
a
Thark
his
head
and
one
hand,
Right?
Your
spirit
annoys
me.

JOHN:
All
this
your
work?
Banths.
Weakness.
Sentiment.
Allowing
this
white
worm
These
are
the
crimes
of
Tars
Tarkas.
We
are
united
We
are
strong

Let
them
be
crushed



JOHN:
Is
that
a
banth?
No.
It
is
a
white
ape.



Tars!
Get
up!
Tars!
Give
me
your
hand!
Give
me
one!
-
Father!
JOHN:
Tars!
Tars!
Hey!

Hey!
Hey,
over
here,
you
blind
monkey!


Release
the
other
one.
(CROWD
ROARS

Watch
your
father
die

No!
Let
us
watch
you!


Sola!
Are
you
mad?
No.
The
blood
of
my
father
drives
me.







Sola!



Virginia!
Virginia!
I
claim
the
right
of
challenge!

You
have
no
right
to
challenge!
You
are
not
Thark!
He
is
Thark!
He
is
Dotar
Sojat!

Dotar
Sojat!
Dotar
Sojat!


Who
will
pledge
their
metal
to
mine?


The
Jeddak
of
Zodanga
And
if
Helium
falls,
so
does
Barsoom.
We
must
throw
off
Tharks
did
not
cause
this.
But,
by
Issus,
Tharks
will
end
it!

We
ride
for
Zodanga!
I
know
that
this
is
not
the
fate
or
for
Helium,
but
choice
is
a
luxury
Even
if,
in
your
heart...
A
heart
is
a
luxury.
MATAI:
Steady.
Remember,
she
is
not
the
prize.
The
prize
is
Barsoom.

SOLA:
You!
Why
is
Zodanga
undefended?
Where
is
everyone?
The
army
has
been
repositioned
Only
a
small
contingent
remains.
Sab
and
Dejah
Thoris.
Where
are
they?
They're
at
the
wedding
in
Helium!
Helium?
TARS:
No!
I
have
made
my
decision.
It's
the
only
way
to
get
there
in
time.
Tharks
do
not
fly.
So
be
it.
This
is
madness,
Dotar
Sojat.
You'll
die!
Then
I'll
see
you
down
the
River
Iss.
Follow
the
canal!
Be
careful!


Like
our
ancestors
before
us,
we
gather
under
the
mingled
light
Cluros
and
Thuria.
As
the
moons
so
do
we
unite
Zodanga
and
Helium.

No!
You'll
raise
the
alarm.
In
the
time
of
oceans,
the
celestial
lovers
to
consummate
their
love
in
the
sky.
Drink
now
So
may
it
be
again.
I
am
yours
forever.
And
I
am
yours
forever.
Carter!
It's
a
trap!
Zodanga's
at
your
walls!
Now!
Do
it
now!
-
No!

Zodanga!

Dejah!
Argh!

If
you'll
just
get
behind
me,
sir.

Carter!

-
It
was
such
a
nice
wedding.
Helium's
fate
is
sealed,
Earthman.
As
is
yours.

Thank
the
Goddess
that's
over
with.


Virginia!
It
is
good
to
fly!
By
Issus,
they
fight
with
us!
KANTOS:
Brother!
Heliumite,
huh?
You're
going
to
tell
me
everything
You
spare
me
and
I'll
tell
you.



A
fitting
solution
for
your
setback,
Dejah
Thoris
survives
her
assassins
but
will
fail
to
prove
of
the
Ninth
Ray.
Yes.
I'll
enjoy
playing
that
out.
DEJAH:
Carter!
Dejah!
I'm
getting
away!
Tars.
The
medallion.
Give
it
to
me,
my
Jeddak.
No!

I'll
explain
later.
TARS:
You
have
won,
my
Jeddak.
All
is
finished.
Not
quite.
A
Jeddak.
I
see
you
have
changed
your
metal.
And
my
heart.
Dejah
Thoris,
would
a
princess
of
Mars
to
a
wayward
Virginia
cavalryman
with
nothing
to
offer?
Yes,
John
Carter.
Yes!
TARDOS:
By
the
ancient
rite
are
you
bound
together,
husband
and
wife.

John?
Homesick
for
the
Thark
nursery?
I'm
sorry.
I
couldn't
sleep.
I
had
that
feeling
you
get,
suddenly,
that
you
left
a
light
burning
or
a
door
open.
Go
back
to
bed.
I
won't
be
long.
Be
back
in
one
xat,
John
Carter
of
Earth.
Come.
John
Carter
of
Earth.
Yup.
John
Carter
of
Mars
Sire,
I
must
express
the
deepest
Please.
The
honor
is
mine.
Fair
enough,
Earthman.

No
way
to

Like
a

Then
I
recalled
Matai
Shang.
His
knowledge
of
Earth,
of
my
history.
It
meant

The
cave
in
Arizona
was
proof.
There
might
be
other
such
proofs,
hidden
all
around
the
world.
I
knew
now
what

So
for
ten
bitter
years,
I
searched.
On
the
trail
of
rumor
and
legend
I
ferreted
out
every
possible
but
I
found
no
medallion.
And
then
it
came
to
me.
MAN:
(SHOUTS
AND
I've
found
it!

JOHN:
And
once
it
came,
I
had
to
make
in

I
could

I

I

Please
send

And,

My

Of
course,
sir.
Now
you
will
understand
The
reason
Why
the

can
only
be
opened
For
if
my
body
dies
on
Earth,
You
are
the
key.
This
is
the
task
I
entrust
to
you
Protect
my

In
the

it

taken
you

so.

I

I

Hello,

You

No.
That's
why
I'm
so
grateful
I...
I
was
just
bait?
No.
You're
far
more
than
that.
I
really
do
need

That
is,

you're
willing.
Goodbye,
Ned.
Oh,

Take
up

Fall

Write

It's
