It's
not
only
advancing,
And
do
you
have
any
idea

Korben,
there's
a

Okay.
There's

much
time
do
we
have?
If
its

CORNELIUS:
Put

You
got
it
figured
out,
Father?
This
one
should
be
fire.
You
know
how
all
this
works?
Theoretically?
The
fifth
element
should
be

then
the

You've
never
seen
this
No.
Every
weapon
has

Yes,
I
know
all
that.
Rain...
falls.
Leeloo.
Leeloo.
What
does
it
mean?
I
think
that--
Maybe
it's
a
charade.
A
game
or
something.
If
we
don't
get
these
stones
open
Dead?
Too
late.
We've
lost
contact
with
them.
I
think
mine
is
broken.
We're
never
gonna
make
it.

Korben.
Korben,
it
moved
!
What'd
you
do?
Nothing.
Shut
up!
Calm
down.
Show
me
I
was
just
standing
here
like
this.
Okay,
and
I
put
my
hands
on
"We're
not
gonna
make
it."
That's
it?

RUBY:
Wind.
She
said,
"Wind--
Wind

you're
very
tired.
I'll

But
listen
to
me,
if
you
don't
do
What's
the
use
of
saving
life
It'll
be
entering
the
atmosphere
KORBEN:
Leeloo,
you're
right.
But
there
are
some
things,
very
nice
things
worth
saving,
Beautiful
things.
Like
love?
Yes,
love.
That's
a
good
example.
I
don't
know
love.
I
was
built
to
protect,
So
there's
no
use
for
me
No,
no,
no,
you're
wrong.
I
need
you.
I
need
you,
very
much.
Why?
Because...
