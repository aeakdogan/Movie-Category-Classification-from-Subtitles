WlGGUM:
Okay,

let's
get
some
lunch.
Did
you
at

bring
my
clothes?
Shirt,
socks,
everything
you
need.
-You
didn't
bring
my

This
is
the
worst
day
of

so
far.
-Say,
Bart?
If
you
need
pants,
You
know
how

helping
me?
We're
neighbors.
I'm

What--?!
You
can't
kill
him

coming
home
with
me.

"A
thousand
eyes."
Hm.
I'm
pretty
sure
Hey,
Marge.
Isn't
it
great
being
married
Actually,
it's
aged
me
horribly.
Then
say
hello

Homer!
I
believe
what
happened
in
church
Please,
get
rid
of
that
pig.
Oh,
you're
gonna
love
him.


You
nailed
her.
He
also
does
me.


You
smiled.
l'm
off
the
hook.
Ooh.

Oh,
you
have
so
many
looks.

So
that's
what
snug
is.
HOMER:

Who's
a
good
pig?

NED:
You
don't
know
what
rough
is,
sister.
Bart,
you
know,
whenever
my
boys
...l
take
them
fishing.
Does
your
dad
ever
take
you
fishing?
Dad,
it's
not
fair
to
use
a
bug
zapper
If
you
love
fish
like
l
do,

I
think
I
have
a
nibble.
Argh!
Argh!
I
think
fishing
might
be
Oh,
great.
Now,
how
about
No
way.
Cocoa's
for
wusses.
Well,
sir,
if
you
change
your
mind,
BART:
Oh,
wait.
l
didn't
tell
you
the
best
part.
Oh,
wait!
l
still
didn't
tell
you
No,
no,
wait!
He's
not
imaginary!
Oh,
honey,
that's
great.
But
the
very
best
thing
Because
nothing
means
more
How
did
the
pig
tracks

Does
whatever
a
Spider-Pig
does
Can
he
swing
from
a
web?
No,
he
can't,
he's

Look
out
Are
we
having
fun
yet?
We
are
now.
You've
got
a
bite.
Whoa,

Oh,
no,
my
good
pole!

Huh?
You're
not
strangling
me.
What
the--?
Well,
it's
not
good
for
anything.
The
only
time
you
should
...is
to

Hey,
what
the
hell
are

Oh.
One
more

Honey,

home.
Ah!

LlSA:
If
we
don't
do
something
now....
I'm
sorry,
I
lost
my
train
of

Agreed.
Okay,
so
here's
the
bottom
line:
If
we
don't
change
our
ways
...pollution
in

Springfield

That's
not
so
bad.
No,
the
lift
is
stuck.
Am
l
getting
through

Hell,
yeah.
All
in
favor
of
a
new
scissor
lift,
CROWD:
Aye.
This
lake
is
just
one
piece
of
trash
But
l
knew
you
wouldn't
listen.
So
l
took
the
liberty
of
pouring
water
MOE:
This
is
serious,
people.
No
more
dumping
in
the
lake.
Code
black.

Black?
That's
the
worst
color
there
is.
-No
offense
there,
Carl.
Sorry,
sorry.
No
dumping
in
the
lake.
Fine.
l
will
put
my
yard
trimmings
Chief,
I
think
there
was
I
thought
that
too,
You
gotta
learn
to
listen,
Lou.
Let
us
now
make
sure
-Cletus.
Try
to
dump
something
in
the
lake.
Okay.
I
can't.
l
simply
can't.
-Brilliant.

Ay-yay-yay!

Don't
get
any
ideas,
huh?

Maybe
we
should
kiss,
What's
going
on
here?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm
not
sure
that
pig
And
by
the
way,
Don't
worry.
It's
leaking.
It's
not
leaking,
it's
overflowing.
He
filled
up
the
whole
silo
Well,
l
helped.

Stop.
I
know
it's
easy
...but
l
want
you
to
I
can't
escape
the
feeling
that
this
You
have
to
dispose
Okay,
Marge.
l
will.
You
can

close,

certainly
seems
odd...
