-
Mr.
Thornhill.
-
Say
hello
to
the
missus.
My
recommendation
is
still
the
same.
Spread
the
good
word
Let
the
opposition
have
their
high
ratings
Why
don't
we
colonize
Let
me
hear
from
you,
Sam.
You
better
walk
me
to
the
Plaza.
MAGGIE:
I
didn't
put
a
coat
on.
-
Next?
Oh,
yes.
Send
her
a
box
of
candy
Each
piece
wrapped
in
gold
paper.
She'll
think
she's
eating
money.
Just
say
to
her:
-
You
sent
that
one
last
time.
Well,
put:
"Something
for
your
sweet
tooth,
-
I
know.
-
For
two
blocks?
That's
your
trouble,
Maggie,
Here.
Taxi.
I
have
a
very
sick
woman
here.
-
Well,
no.
Perfectly
all
right.
-
First
stop,
the
Plaza.
Don't
throw
the
flag.
Oh,
come,
come,
come.
-
I
made
him
feel
like
a
good
Samaritan.
Ah,
in
the
world
of
advertising,
There's
only
the
expedient
exaggeration.
-
Say,
do
I
look
heavyish
to
you?
I
feel
heavyish.
Put
a
note
on
my
desk
in
the
morning:
"Think
thin."
-
Better
make
it
the
59th
Street
entrance.
Oh.
Soon
as
you
get
back,
Remind
her
we've
got
those
theater
tickets
Dinner
at
21,
7:00.
I'll
have
had
two
martinis
at
the
Oak
Bar,
-
She
doesn't
do
that.
Bigelow
at
10:30
is
your
first
tomorrow,
...then
lunch
with
Falcon
and
his
wife.
-
Oh,
yeah.
Where
was
that?
-
Oh.
Absolutely
not.
Here,
driver,
take
this
lady
-
Right.
-
Don't
forget,
call
my
mother
right
away.
-
Good
night,
Mr.
Thornhill.
Oh,
wait,
Maggie.
You
can't
call
her.
-
Good
evening.
I'm
looking
for
Mr.
Weltner
Yes,
sir.
Right
this
way.
ROGER:
Herman.
-
I'm
a
little
late.
-
Fanning
Nelson.
-
How
do
you
do?
-
We
got
a
little
head
start
here.
I
was
telling
Larry
and
Fanning
you
may
be
-
What's
the
matter?
You've
got
the
fidgets.
I
told
my
secretary
to
call
Mother.
HERMAN:
Why
not?
-
Your
secretary?
One
of
those
new
apartments.
MAN:
George
Kaplan.
-
Mr.
George
Kaplan?
-
Kaplan.
Could
you
send
it
for
me
Oh,
I'm
not
permitted
to
do
that,
sir,
-
Oh.
Will
you
excuse
me,
gentlemen?
-
Right
through
there,
sir.
Thank
you,
sir.
Wait,
what's
that
supposed
to
be?
The
car's
waiting
outside.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
Let's
go
where?
Who...?
Who
are
you?
Mere
errand
boys
His
is
pointed
at
your
heart.
So,
please,
What
is
this,
a
joke
or
something?
-
Yes,
a
joke.
We
will
laugh
in
the
car.
ROGER:
Don't
tell
me
where
we're
going,
You
know,
I
left
some
friends
back
there
They're
going
to
think
I'm
awfully
rude.
I
mean,
uh,
couldn't
we
stop
off
...so
that
I
could
explain
Well,
that
is
what's
happening,
isn't
it?

Locked.
Who's
Townsend?
Really?
Interesting.
-
Where
is
he?
-
Tell
him
I'm
here.
Never
mind
that.
Say
to
him:
"Kaplan."
By
the
way,
-
Is
anyone
in
the
library?
This
way.
You
will
wait
here.
Well,
don't
hurry.

Good
evening.
Not
what
I
expected.
A
little
taller.
A
little
more
polished
than
the
others.
Oh,
I'm
so
glad
you're
pleased,
But
I'm
afraid
just
as
obvious.
What
the
devil
is
all
this
about?
Games?
Must
we?
Not
that
I
mind
a
case
of
abduction...
...but
I
have
tickets
To
a
show
I
was
looking
forward
to.
And
I
With
such
expert
play-acting,
Oh,
Leonard,
He's
a
well-tailored
one,
isn't
he?
My
secretary
is
a
great
admirer
-
Elusiveness,
however
misguided...
-
Did
you
call
me
"Kaplan"?
...but
I'm
perfectly
willing
to
accept
Current
choice?
My
name
is
Thornhill.
Roger
Thornhill.
Of
course.
Your
friends
picked
up
the
wrong
package
Do
sit
down,
Mr.
Kaplan.
I
told
you,
I'm
not
Kaplan,
-
Excuse
me.
The
guests
are
here,
dear.
LESTER:
Look
after
them.
Now,
shall
we
get
down
to
business?
I'm
all
for
that.
Simply,
I'd
like
you
to
tell
me
...and
how
you've
come
by
-
I
don't
expect
to
get
this
for
nothing.
Don't
misunderstand,
I
don't
expect
you
...but
the
least
I
can
do
is
afford
you
What
the
devil
is
that
supposed
to
mean?
Why
don't
you
surprise
me,
ROGER:
I've
already
told
you...
I
know
where
I'm
headed.
I'm
headed
for
the
Winter
Garden
Theater
in
Townsend,
This
is
not
going
to
lead
ROGER:
I'm
not
Kaplan.
We
also
know
your
contact
in
Pittsburgh
What
contact?
On
June
the
16th,
you
checked
...as
Mr.
George
Kaplan
A
week
later,
you
registered
...as
Mr.
George
Kaplan
of
Pittsburgh.
On
August
11th,
August
the
29th,
George
Kaplan
of
Boston
At
present,
you
are
registered
...at
the
Plaza
Hotel
in
New
York
-
Really?
...you
are
due
at
the
Ambassador
East
And
then
at
the
Sheraton-Johnson
Hotel
-
Not
me.
...in
maintaining
that
you're
deceiving
us
I
don't
suppose
it
would
do
any
good
...a
driver's
license,
things
like
that?
It's
getting
late.
I
have
guests.
Do
you
intend
to
cooperate
with
us?
A
simple
no.
For
the
simple
reason
I
simply
don't
know
LESTER:
A
pleasant
journey,
sir.
-
Scotch?
Rye?
Bourbon?
Vodka?
LEONARD:
But
first,
a
libation.
Bourbon.
You
drink
it.
It'll
be
easier
if
you
take
this
yourself.
Cheers.


Don't
worry
about
me,
fellas.







Thanks
for
the
lift,
fellas.
I
want
this
man
examined
for
driving
-
Really?
You
see,
they
tried
to
kill
me.
In
a
big
house,
they
tried
to
kill
me.
-
All
right,
let's
just
go
inside.
-
Somebody
call
the
police.
Okay.
Sit
down.
ROGER:
Perfectly
all
right.
See?
We'll
get
them.
We'll
throw
the
book
Assault
with
a
gun,
and
a
bourbon,
You'll
be
all
right
after
a
good
night's
sleep.
-
I
don't
want
a
cell.
I
want
a
policeman.
-
Uh-huh.
-
I
got
to
call
someone.
Where's
the
phone?
-
Over
here.
You
better
make
it
your
lawyer.
Butterfield
8-1-0-9-8.
What
am
I,
a
telephone
operator?
Butterfield
8-1-0-9-8.
Just
a
minute,
please.
Here.
Thank
you.

Hello,
Mother?
Mother,
this
is
your
son,
Roger
Thornhill.
Yeah.
Wait
a
minute,
I'll
find
out.
-
Where
am
I?
Glen
Cove
Police
Station.
No.
No,
Mother,
I
have
not
been
drinking.
No.
No,
these
two
men,
they
poured
No,
they
didn't
give
me
a
chaser.
No.
Come
on,
let's
go.
-
Wait,
I'm
not
finished
yet.
Mother,
I
gotta
go
now.
Get
my
lawyer
right
away,
Tomorrow
morning,
tell
her.
Tomorrow
morning,
he
says.
I
don't
know.
I'll
ask
him.
Sergeant
Emile
Klinger.
Sergeant
Emile...
Emile?
Sergeant
Emile
Klinger.
No,
I
didn't
believe
it
either.
Uh,
I'm
all
right,
Mother.
Good
night.
That
was
Mother.
Let's
go.
Here's
your
man,
doctor.
-
What's
your
name?
Stick
out
your
tongue
and
say
"ah."
You
better
move
back.
Ah...
Have
you
been
drinking?
Doctor,
I
am
gassed.
What
were
you
drinking?
Well,
bourbon.
-
How
much
would
you
say
you
drank?
-
How
much
would
you
say
that
you
drank?
Mr.
Thornhill,
it
is
my
opinion
No
question
about
it.
I
am
now
gonna
ask
your
permission
ROGER:
"You
may
refuse
to
permit
a
blood
test

if
you
do,
You
have
the
right
It

Do
you
know
him
LARRABEE:
Absolutely.
-
Mother.
...there
is
some
credence
to
this
story?
-
Credence?
I
mean,
if
my
client
says
...I'm
certain
it
must've
happened.
Sergeant,
I
want
this
turned
over
Call
them
up

Right,
Your
Honor.
...I'm
going
to
set
this
over
for

night
at

At

time
I
expect

In
the
meantime,
the
county
detectives
will
"Basis
in
fact"?
If
I
were
brought
in
dead,
Roger,
wait
a
minute.
I
mean,
after
all,
Your
Honor,
That
is
precisely
what
-
Yes?
-
Yes,
sir.
-
Is
Mr.
Townsend
at
home?
Mrs.
Townsend?
-
Who
shall
I
say
is
calling?
Come
in,
please.
This
way,
please.
This
is
the
room.
-
I'll
call
madam.
And
here's
the
sofa
They
spilled
bourbon
all
over
it.
Well,
they
must've
cleaned
them
off.
This
is
the
cabinet
Scotch,
gin,
vodka...
And
bourbon.
I
remember
when
it
used
to
come
Roger,
dear,
Did
you
get
home
all
right?
Let
me
look
at
you.
It
was
a
dull
party.
I
want
you
all
to
know,

I'm
Captain
Junket
-
This
is
Lieutenant
Harding.
You
haven't
gotten
into
trouble,
Roger?
-
Stop
calling
me
Roger.
Mr.
Thornhill
was
picked
up
last
night
...and
incidentally,
in
a
stolen
car.
JUNKET:
Belonging
to
Mrs.
Babson
Roger,
you
said
-
You
didn't
borrow
Laura's
Mercedes?
Mr.
Thornhill
told
us
that
he
was
brought
...and,
uh,
forcibly
intoxicated
...and
set
out
on
the
road.
-
Do
you
know
anything
about
this?
...Roger
was
a
bit
tipsy
She's
lying.
TOWNSEND:
...as
the
evening
wore
on.
Finally,
he
told
us
he
had
to
go
home
Oh,
I
knew
What
a
performance.
Mrs.
Townsend,
does
the
name
TOWNSEND:
-
No.
Where's
her
husband?
-
Is
there
any
place
he
can
be
reached?
United
Nat...?
TOWNSEND:
He's
addressing
All
right.
So
he's
addressing
-
Sorry
we
had
to
bother
you.
Now,
wait
a
minute.

TOWNSEND:
Will
you
be
wanting
JUNKET:
No,
Mrs.
Townsend,
You
mean
you're
not
gonna
Roger.
Pay
the
two
dollars.

Goodbye.
-
I
don't
see
why
you
want
me
along.
Don't
be
sarcastic,
Roger.
ROGER:
Well,
here
goes.
Ahem.
Hello,
Operator.
Have
you
got
That's
right.
You
have?
Room
796?
Ring
it,
will
you
please?
You
see?
I
see.
I
hope
he
clears
up
-
You're
ruining
my
whole
day.
Oh.
Well,
did
he
leave
word
Really?
Thank
you.
Well,
that's
odd.
He
hasn't
answered
Maybe
he
got
locked
in
the
bathroom.
Mother,
do
me
a
favor,
will
you?
Put
on
that
innocent
look
you
do
so
well
Don't
be
ridiculous.
-
Ten
dollars?
-
Fifty?
Car
theft,
drunk
driving,
And
now,
housebreaking.
You're
hotel-breaking.
-
Of
five
to
ten
years.
Will
you
want
me
Yes.
Well,
but
not
right
now.
I
mention
it,
because
the
bed
...and
I
was
wondering
-
Oh.
Thank
you
for
your
interest.
Come
on,
now.
Now,
she
seemed
to
think
I'm
Kaplan.
I
wonder
if
I
look
like
Kaplan.
-
Oh,
well,
look
who's
here.
ROGER:
Our
friend
who's
assembling
Roger,
I
think
we
should
go.
-
Don't
be
nervous.
-
I'll
be
late
for
the
bridge
club.
Ooh.
-
Bulletin,
Kaplan
has
dandruff.

Too
late.
-
You
rang
for
me,
sir?
-
What's
your
name?
-
Elsie,
do
you
know
who
I
am?
Well,
when
did...?
Outside
the
door.
Out
in
the
hall,
a
couple
of
minutes
ago.
And
that's
the
first
time
Can
I
help
it
if
you're
never
around,
Well,
then,
how
do
you
know
-
What?
Well,
of
course
you
are.
So
you're
the
gentleman
in
room
796,
All
right,
Elsie,
thanks.
-
Will
that
be
all,
sir?

Valet.
Oh,
yes,
come
in.
Should
I
hang
it
in
the
closet,
Mr.
Kaplan?
Yes,
please.
Tell
me,
uh...
I
forgot,
Last
night,
around,
uh...
-
Around
6.
-
Did
I
give
it
to
you
personally?
No.
You
called
down
on
the
phone
...and
said
it
would
be
hanging
-
Anything
wrong?
-
Here.
Thanks.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Mr.
Kaplan.
Isnt
that
the
damnedest
thing?
I'm
beginning
to
think
that
no
one
Maybe
he
has
his
suits
mended
Oh...
Let
me
see
something.
I
don't
think
that
one
does
anything
Ah,
now,
that's
much
better.
Now,
obviously
they've
mistaken
me

-
Should
I?
Here,
hold
that,
dear.
Hello.

About

We,

We

Nothing?

Well,
that's

We

What
can
we
do
to
save
him
Aren't
we
being
just
a
wee
bit
callous?
No,
my
dear
woman,
We
didn't
invent
our
nonexistent

establish
elaborate
behavior
patterns

move
his

Very
well,
then.
If
we
make
the
slightest
move
to
suggest
...give
any
hint
to
Vandamm

of
our
own
agent...
...then
our

you.
Kaplan
checked
out.
He
went
Yes,
that's
why
I'm...
Well,
I
can't
go
to

You
saw
the

...I'm

It's

Yes,
I
know.
Could
you
make
it
snappy?
-
Sold
out?
No,
I
can't
do
that.
Nothing
till

You're
in
a
hurry,
huh?
Well,
could
you
call
them
Something

Yes,
they're

Sure.
Sure.
Don't

quite
good.

There
you
are.
Thank
you.

-
I
know.
I
look
vaguely
familiar.
ROGER:
You
feel
you've
seen
me
Mm-hm.
Funny
how
I
have
that
effect
on
people.
It's
a
nice
face.
-
You
think
so?
ROGER:
Oh,
you're
that
type.
ROGER:
Not
really.
-
Good.
Because
honest
women
frighten
me.
I
don't
know.
Somehow,
-
Because
you're
not
honest
with
them?
Like
that
business
Well,
what
I
mean
is,
...I
have
to
start
pretending
What
makes
you
think
you
have
She
might
find
the
idea
objectionable.
Then
again,
she
might
not.
Think
how
lucky
I
am
Oh,
luck
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
Fate?
I
tipped
the
steward
$5
to
seat
you
here
Is
that
a
proposition?
I
never
discuss
love
You've
already
eaten.
But
you
haven't.
Don't
you
think
it's
time
I'm
Eve
Kendall.
I'm
26
and
unmarried.
Now
you
know
everything.
Tell
me.
What
do
you
do
besides
lure
men
I'm
an
industrial
designer.
Jack
Phillips.
Western
sales
manager
No,
you're
not.
...and
you're
wanted
for
murder
And
don't
be
so
modest.
Whoops.
Oh,
don't
worry.
-
I
won't
say
a
word.
I
told
you.
It's
a
nice
face.
Is
that
the
only
reason?
It's
going
to
be
a
long
night.
True.
And
I
don't
particularly
like
the
book
You
know
what
I
mean?
Let
me
think.
Yes,
I
know
exactly
what
you
mean.
There's
my
trademark.
R.O.T.
Roger
O.
Thornhill.
Nothing.
I'd
invite
you
to
my
bedroom
-
A
roomette?
I've
been
playing
hide-and-seek
-
How
awkward
for
you.
No
place
to
sleep.
I
have
a
large
drawing
room
all
to
myself.
That
doesn't
seem
quite
fair,
does
it?
Drawing
room
E.
Car
3901.
Such
a
nice
number.
It's
easy
to
remember.
Thirty-nine-oh-one.
See?
No
luggage.
-
So?
...to
have
an
extra
pair
of
pajamas,
Wouldn't
I?
Incidentally,
I
wouldn't
order
any
dessert
I
get
the
message.
That
isn't
exactly
what
I
meant.
This
train
seems
to
be
making
And
I
just
saw
two
men
get
out
They
weren't
smiling.
ROGER:
I
think
you
better
go
out
Patience
is
a
virtue.
ROGER:
Just
lie
still.
ROGER:
EVE:
ROGER:
I
want
to
be
packed
in
olive
oil

Come
in.
-
Who
are
you?
Your
name
please?
Eve
Kendall.
Is
anything
wrong?
There
was
a
man
at
your
table
tonight
-
Yes.
I
never
saw
him
before.
Is
this
the
man?
Yes,
I
think
so.
It's
a
Wirephoto.
-
Police?
Good
heavens,
no.
The
steward
said
We
might
have
happened
to
leave
What
did
you
two
talk
about?
Talk
about?
Your
waiter
said
you
were
getting
along
Is
that
his
name?
Thornhill?
You
mean,
he
didn't
tell
you?
He
didn't
tell
me
anything.
All
we
did
was
chat
...train
travel
versus
plane
travel,
Rather
innocuous,
I
must
say,
-
Who
did
he
kill?
No.
I
assumed
Chicago.
You
think
perhaps
he
got
off
If
you
happen
Kendall.
OFFICER:
I'm
going
to
bed
So
I
doubt
if
I'll
seeing
Well,
just
in
case
you
do,
we'll
be
in
It's
comforting
to
know
that.
Good
night.

Still
breathing?
ROGER:
I'm
looking
for
the
can
opener
Hello,
there.
Hello.
Hmm.
Tell
me,
why
are
you
so
good
to
me?
Shall
I
climb
up
and
tell
you
why?
You
know,
I've
been
thinking,
...to
roam
around
Chicago
...you've
been
telling
me
about.
You'll
be
picked
up
by
the
police
Such
a
nice
face
too.
Now,
don't
you
think
it
would
be
a
better
...while
I
located
him
for
you
I
can't
let
you
get
involved.
I'm
a
big
girl.
Yeah,
and
in
all
the
right
places
too.
You
know,
this
is
ridiculous.
Yes.
I
mean,
we've
hardly
met.
That's
right.
How
do
I
know
you
aren't
a
murderer?
You
don't.
Maybe
you're
planning
to
murder
me,
Shall
I?
Please
do.
Beats
flying,
doesn't
it?
We
should
stop.
Immediately.
I
ought
to
know
more
about
you.
What
more
could
you
know?
You're
an
advertising
man,
That's
right.
Train's
a
little
unsteady.
Who
isn't?
What
else
do
you
know?
You've
got
taste
in
clothes,
And
taste
in
women.
I
like
your
flavor.
You're
very
clever
with
words.
You
can
probably
make
them
Sell
people
things
they
don't
need...
...make
women
who
don't
know
you
I'm
beginning
to
think
I'm
underpaid.

ROGER:
Oh,
porter.
-
Don't
bother
with
the
washroom.
By
the
way,
I
found
this
on
the
floor.
Yes,
ma'am.
-
I'll
wait
outside.
EVE:
PORTER:
EVE:
Come
out,
come
out,
wherever
you
are.
The
porter.
So
I
see.
Now...
...where
were
we?
Oh,
yes.
-
Nice
of
him
to
have
opened
the
bed.
-
Only
one
bed.
That's
a
good
omen,
don't
you
think?
Wonderful.
-
Do
you
know
what
that
means?
What?
Tell
me.
It
means
you're
going
A
message
from
the
lady
in
3901.
-
You
keep
walking.
I'll
catch
up.
-
Anything
to
report,
Miss
Kendall?
No,
I
mean,
have
you
seen
the
man
-
Mr.
Thornycroft?
No,
no.
I'm
awfully
sorry.
But
good
luck
to
you
both.
-
How
are
we
doing?
Not
yet.
Hmm?
I'm
accustomed
to
having
a
load
on,
-
Bowling
balls,
naturally.
-
Which
one
of
these
has
my
suit
in
it?
Oh,
thanks.
That
ought
to
do
the
suit
I'm
sure
Mr.
Kaplan
Yeah,
if
he's
still
there.
What
time
is
it?
Nine-ten.
Nine-ten?
Well,
he
may
have
left
I'll
call
him
for
you
No
thank
you,
I
can
do
it.
A
redcap
in
a
phone
booth?
I,
uh...
Well,
all
right.
What
are
you
gonna
Mm-hm.
You
want
to
see
him
right
away.
-
Mm-hm.
Right.
While
I'm
calling,
Where
do
you
propose
I
do
that?
I
sort
of
had
the
men's
room
in
mind.
Did
you,
now?
You're
the
smartest
girl
I
think
we
made
it.
Where
did
he
go?
-
Which
way
did
he
go?
I
don't
know.
He
took
my
clothes.
Come
on.

Yes.
Well,
he'll
see
you,
but
not

He'll
see
you

I've

Fine.
I'll

Mr.
Kaplan
said

All
right.
What'll
I
do
when
I
get
there?
Just
wait
beside
the
road.
-
Well,
how
will
I
know
him?
-
You
made
the
Chicago
papers
too.
Have
you
got
your
watch
set
Yes,
I
did
that.
Thanks.
-
What's
the
matter?
Yes,
you
seem...
I
don't
know.
You
know,
you
better
go
before
the
police
We'll
see
each
other
again,
won't
we?
Sometime,
I'm
sure.
I
never
had
a
moment
EVE:
Please
go.
I've
gotta
pick
up
my
bags
now.
Oh,
yes.
Well,
these
are
the
checks
Wait
a
minute.
Please.
EVE:
Hi.

Hot
day.
Are
you
supposed
-
Waiting

Due
any
minute.
Some
of
them
crop-duster
pilots
get
rich,
Yeah.
And,
uh,
then
your
name
isn't
Kaplan?
Can't
say
it
is,
because
it
ain't.
Here
she
comes.
Right
on
time.
-
That's
funny.
That
plane's
dusting
crops
Get
out
of
here!
What
happened?
Hey!
Come
back!
Hey!
Come
back!
Come
back!
Hey!
-
Yes?
Could
you
let
me
have
-
Kaplan?
I
think
he
checked
out.
-
He
checked
out?
He
checked
out
at
7:10
this
morning.
-
Seven-ten?
Are
you
sure?
Hotel
Sheraton-Johnson,
Seven-ten?
Well,
then
how
come
I
got
a
message
What's
that?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Sorry
to
bother
you
again.
Miss
Eve
Kendall
is
expecting
me.
I've
forgotten
the
number.
-
She's
in
463.

Hello.
Surprised?
Yes.
No
getting
rid
of
me,
is
there?
I
could
use
a
drink.
-
I
have
some
Scotch.
How
did
it
go
today?
-
The
meeting
with
Kaplan?
He
didn't
show
up.
Oh?
It's
funny,
isn't
it?
Why
funny?
Oh,
after
all
those
involved
and
explicit
-
Maybe
I
copied
them
down
wrong.
I
think
you
sent
me
to
the
right
place,
Why
don't
you
call
him
back
again
I
did.
He
checked
out.
South
Dakota?
Rapid
City.
Well,
what
are
you
going
to
do
next?
I
haven't
made
my
mind
up
yet.
It
may
depend
on
you.
-
On
me?
You're
my
little
helper,
aren't
you?
Thank
you.
To
us.
Meaning,
from
now
on,
I'm
not
going
I'm
afraid
you'll
have
to.
-
Oh,
no.
And
you
do
have
problems.
Well,
wouldn't
it
be
nice
if
my
problems
Then
we
could
always
stay
close
...and
not
have
to
go
off
Togetherness.
You
know
what
I
mean?

Go
ahead,
it
can't
be
for
me.
Hello?
Yes.
No,
not
yet.
I'm
not
ready.
What
time?
Yes.
Goodbye.
Business?
-
Yes.
Mm-hm.
All
work
and
no
play?
A
girl
like
you
...instead
of
taking
phone
calls
What
about
having
dinner
with
me?
-
You
can't
afford
to
be
seen
anyplace.
No,
I...
I
can't.
ROGER:
I
want
you
to
do
a
favor
for
me.
-
A
big,
big
favor.
I
want
you
to
leave
right
now.
Stay
far
away
from
me
We're
not
going
to
get
involved.
Last
night
was
last
night
That's
all
there
is.
There
isn't
going
So,
please...
Goodbye.
Good
luck.
No
conversation.
Just
leave.
-
Right
away?
No
questions
asked?
Yes.
-
No,
I
can't
do
that.
-
After
dinner.
After
dinner.
Fair
is
fair.
All
right.
On
one
condition.
That
you
let
the

You
belong

Okay.
There's

Hello.
Valet

Hello,

How
quickly

get
a

Yes,
fast.
Twenty
minutes?
Fine.
Okay,
463.
He'll
be
right
up.
EVE:

Now,
what
could
a
man
do
Couldn't
he
have
taken
an
hour?
You
could
always
take
a
cold
shower.
That's
right.
You
know,
when
I
was
a
little
boy,
-
You're
a
big
boy
now.
Tell
me,
how
does
a

like
you
Lucky,
I
guess.
Oh,
not
lucky.
Naughty.
Wicked.
Because
I
bet
you
could
tease
a
man
So
stop
trying,

Be

For
what?

I
don't
wanna
be

I
want
to
be
taken
to

headquarters.
Why
do
you
think
I
sent
for
you?
How
about
this
guy,
Charlie?
-
Sit
back.
I
want
to
be
taken
to
police
headquarters.
-
I'm
a
mad
killer

They
said
right
here.
Does
anyone
mind
if
I
sit
down?
Thought
I'd
never
make
it.
All
right,
men.
Thank
you.
-
This
way,
Mr.
Thornhill.
We
haven't
much
time.
-
I
don't
think
I
caught
your
name.
You're
police,
aren't
you?
Or
is
it

FBI,
CIA,
ONI.

We're
all
in
the
same

soup.
You
can
stick
this

your

We
know
that.
Then
why
did
you
let
the
police
We
never
interfere
with
the
police,
-
It's
become
necessary.
Well,
then,
I
take
it
I
do
wish
you'd
walk
faster,
Mr.
Thornhill.
Where
are
we
going?
Rapid
City,
South
Dakota.
-
Rapid
City?
What
for?
No,
thank
you.
So
has
your
friend
Mr.
Vandamm.
Vandamm?
A
rather
formidable
What
about
that
treacherous
little
tramp
-
Miss
Kendall?
His
mistress.
We
know
all
about
her.
Tell
me,
what's
Vandamm
up
to?
Oh,
you
could
say
he's
a
sort
Of
what?
Oh.
Government
secrets,
perhaps.
Well,
then
why
don't
you
grab
him?
There's
still
too
much
we
don't
know
Oh,
I
see.
What's
all
this
got
to
do
Well,
Vandamm
has
a
place
near
there.
We
think
it's
his
jumping-off
point
-
Are
you
gonna
stop
him?
Well,
then
what
are
we
going
there
for?
To
set
his
mind
at
ease
Oh,
you,
huh?
Oh,
no,
Mr.
Thornhill.
What
do
you
mean?
I've
been
in
his
room.
I've
tried
on
his
clothes.
Believe
me,
Mr.
Thornhill,
Which
is
why
I'm
gonna
have
to
ask
you
Come
on.
We'll
discuss
it
on
the
plane.

Now,
look.
You
started
this
decoy
business
We
might
have
You
ought
to
give
me
a
medal
...just
so
your
special
agent
or
whatever
Not
shot
at,
Mr.
Thornhill.
Found
out.
Thanks
to
you,
Thanks
to
me?
-
If
you'll
get
on
the
plane...
I'm
an
advertising
man,
not
a
red
herring.
...two
ex-wives
and
several
bartenders
...and
I
don't
intend
to
disappoint
them
all
The
answer
is
no.
-
Is
that
final?
-
Goodbye,
then.
If
there
was
a
chance
of
changing
Of
whom
you
so
obviously
disapprove.
Yes,
for
using
sex
I
don't
suppose
it
would
matter
to
you...
...that
she
was
probably
forced
to
do
To
protect
herself
from
what?
Exposure
and
assassination.
You
see,
Mr.
Thornhill,
she...
She's
one
of
our
agents.
-
Oh,
no.
...but
I'm
afraid
you
have
put
her
And
much
more
than
her
life
is
at
stake.
-
Suppose
they
don't
come?
ROGER:
I
don't
like
the
way
Perhaps
he's
trying
to
give
you
Speak
soft,
and
carry
a
big
stick.
He's
trying
to
tell
me
not
to
go
through
He
doesn't
know
to
what
extent
I
don't
know
that
I
care
Dear,
fellow,
if
you
hadn't
made
yourself
...that
she
fell
for
you...
-
Our
friend
Vandamm
wouldn't
It
was
quite
obvious
to
him
last
night
Worst
of
all,
with
a
man
he
thinks
Are
you
trying
to
tell
me
I'm
trying
to
remind
you
it
is
your
...to
Vandamm's
good
graces...
...right
up
to
the
point
All
right,
all
right.
But,
after
tonight...
My
blessings
on
you
both.
Here
they
are.
-
Good
afternoon,
Mr.
Kaplan.
Did
I
misunderstand
you
We'll
get
to
that
later.
I
suppose
you
were
surprised
Not
at
all.
I
knew
the
police
By
the
way,
I
want
to
compliment
you
...from
the
auction
gallery.
Thank
you.
And
now,
what
little
drama
I
don't
for
a
moment
believe
that
you've
...to
come
to
a
business
arrangement.
Suppose
I
tell
you
I
not
only
know
the
exact
...but
the
latitude
and
longitude
...and
your
ultimate
destination.
You
wouldn't
care
to
carry
my
bags
for
me,
Perhaps
you'd
be
interested
in
the
price,
-
The
price?
How
much
did
you
have
in
mind?
I
want
the
girl.
I
want
the
girl
to
get
Turn
her
over
to
me,
I'll
see
there's
...uncomfortable
for
the
rest
of
her
life.
You
do
that,
She
really
did
get
under
your
skin.
We're
not
talking
about
my
skin.
-
I'm
offering
you
a
chance
to
save
it.
Put
it
any
way
you
like.
I'm
curious,
Mr.
Kaplan.
What
made
you
arrive
at
the
deduction
that
...have
deteriorated
to
the
point
where
I
don't
deduce.
I
observe.
Phillip,
if
you
don't
mind,
Just
a
second,
you.
Stay
away
from
me.
Let
go.
Stay
away
from
me.
Let
go.
Let
go
of
me.
-
Now,
save
the
phony
tears.
-
You
little
fool.

No
good,
sir.
-
Don't
touch
anything.
Stand
back.
PROFESSOR:
Don't
be
long.
Hello.
Hello.
Are
you
all
right?
Yes,
I
think
so.
I
asked
the
professor
There's
not
much
time.
Isnt
there?
I
wanted
to
tell
you...
I
mean,
apologize.
No
need.
I
understand.
All
in
the
line
of
duty.
I
did
treat
you
miserably.
I,
uh...
I
hated
you
for
it.
I
didn't
want
you
to
go
on
And
I...
I
used
some
pretty
harsh
words.
They
hurt
deeply.
-
Well,
naturally,
if
I'd
known...
-
Of
course
not.
No,
I
guess
not.
EVE:
You
didn't
get
hurt.
I'm
so
relieved.
-
How
would
you
have
felt?
-
When
I
shot
you
with
the
blanks.
EVE:
You
did
it
rather
well,
I
thought.
Considering
Well,
I
got
into
it
by
accident.
I
met
Phillip
Vandamm
at
a
party
one
night
Oh.
I
guess
I
had
nothing
to
do
I
decided
to
fall
in
love.
Well,
that's
nice.
Eventually,
the
professor
and
his
...with
a
few
sordid
details
about
Phillip
...my
relationship
with
him
Mm-hm.
So
you
became
a
Girl
Scout,
huh?
Maybe
it
was
the
first
time
anyone
Has
life
been
like
that?
How
come?
Men
like
you.
What's
wrong
with
men
like
me?
They
don't
believe
in
marriage.
I've
been
married
twice.
See
what
I
mean?
I
may
go
back
to
hating
you.
Goodbye,
darling.
-
Wait
a
minute.
Not
so
soon.
...that
I
took
the
long
way
around
Couldn't
we
stand
like
this
Just
this
time
you're
supposed
I
never
felt
more
alive.
Well,
whose
side
are
you
on?
Yours,
always,
darling.
Please
don't
undermine
my
resolve

Oh,
well,
I
guess
it's
off
to
the
hospital
I
don't
like
it
a
bit.
It's
much
safer
now,
thanks
to
you,
Don't
thank
me.
I
couldn't
stand
it.
All
right.
I
won't.
After
your
malevolent
friend
Vandamm
...you
and
I
are
gonna
get
together
and
do
a
-
You
know
that
can't
be.
He
has
told
you,
hasn't
he?
-
Told
me
what?
-
Wait
a
minute.
What
didn't
you
tell
me?
She's
going
off
with
Vandamm
tonight
She's
going
off
with
Vandamm?
We
went
to
such
lengths
So
that
Vandamm
couldn't
very
well
decline
I
needn't
tell
you
how
valuable
You
lied
to
me.
-
I
needed
your
help.
Don't
be
angry.
You
think
I'm
gonna
let
you
-
Oh,
she
has
to.
I
don't
like
the
games
War
is
hell,
Mr.
Thornhill,
If
you
can't
lick
the
Vandamms
...without
asking
girls
to
bed
down
...and
never
come
back...
...perhaps
you
ought
to
learn
I'm
afraid
we're
already
doing
that.
-
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
do
this.
Get
out.

Slacks,

Thanks.
That'll
do
for
you
around
here
For
the

Hey.
What's
this?
That's
where
I
hit
the
chair
You
and
your
dopey
schemes,
shootings.
-
Otherwise,
feeling
all
right?
Considering
your
driver
Yeah,
I'm
sorry
about
that.
No,
that's
all
right.
I
guess
I
deserved
it.
I
guess
I
deserve
that
locked
door
too.
You
seen
wandering
about
in
good
health
-
I've
begun
to
forget
her
already.
-
Better
that
way.
Inside
of
an
hour,
she'll
be
gone.

How's
everything
out
in
Rapid
City?
Mr.
Kaplan's
untimely

Everyone's
been
cooperating
beautifully.
Well,
now
you
can
include
me.
-
I'm
a
cooperator.

Care
to
do
me
a
favor
in
return?
I'd
like
a
drink.
Will
you
get
me
a...?
A
pint
will
do.
Can
I
join
you?
Well,
if
you're
gonna
join
me,
-
See
you
in
a
few
minutes.
-
Stop.
Stop.

-
You
don't
want
me
to
take
you
up
there?
Oh,
thanks.
VANDAMM:
There's
nothing
to
worry
about.
VANDAMM:
I'm
not
just
saying
this
I
mean
it.
EVE:
VANDAMM:
He
wanted
to
destroy
you.
EVE:
But
not
endanger
you.
Soon
we'll
be
off
together
and
I
shall
What's
the
situation,
Leonard?
-
About
the
plane,
you
mean?
What
was
the
last
report?
Over
Whitestone
on
the
hour,
VANDAMM:
About
ten
minutes,
huh?
And
now,
uh...
I
wonder
if
I
might
have
a
few
words
Certainly.
In
private?
I'll
go
up
and
get
my
things.
VANDAMM:
...how
does
one
say
goodbye
I'm
afraid
you're
gonna
wish
Mm-hm.
LEONARD:
I
know
how
terribly
fond
you
are
I
don't
find
this
a
terribly
attractive...
-
She
is
not
to
be
trusted.
I'm
not
being
mysterious
at
all.
It
couldn't
have
been
anything.
You
must've
had
some
doubts
-
And
still
do.
LEONARD:
Why
else
would
...that
our
little
treasure
here
You
seem
to
be
trying
to
fill
mine
LEONARD:
Sometimes
the
truth
The
truth?
I've
heard
nothing
Call
it
my
woman's
intuition
if
you
will,
Neatness
is
always
the
result
She
shot
him
in
a
moment
-
You
were
there
yourself.
You
saw
it.
And
thereby
wrapped
everything
up
A,
she
removed
any
doubts
Now,
what
did
you
call
it,
her
devotion?
B,
she
gave
herself
a
new
and
urgent
reason
...in
case
you
decided
to
change
your
mind.

I
think
you're
jealous.
No,
I
mean
it,
Leonard!
LEONARD:
I
found
it
in
her
luggage.
It's
an
old
trick.
Shoot
one
of
your
own
They've
just
freshened
it
up
a
bit
What
was
that
noise?
Yes,
we
wondered
what
it
was
too.
Hurry,
darling.
It's
almost
time
to
leave.
EVE:
You're
not
taking
her
on
that
plane
Of
course
I
am.
Like
our
friends,
This
matter
is
best
disposed
of
...over
water.
VANDAMM:
How
about
a
little
champagne
EVE:
VANDAMM:
It
may
not
be
cold
enough.
VANDAMM:
Are
you
sure?
VANDAMM:
EVE:
VANDAMM:
To
you,
my
dear,
and
all
EVE:

is.

VANDAMM:
LEONARD:
VANDAMM:
You
always
were
a
spoilsport,
LEONARD:
One
of
my
most
It
would
please
me
if
you
would
think
of
me
...if
only
in
spirit.
LEONARD:
He's
heading
pretty
far
out
I
guess
he's
gonna
play
it
safe
You
couldn't
ask
Ceiling
and
possibilities
unlimited.
Ah,
there
he
goes,
starting
his
turn.
Well,
we
better
get
moving.
He
should
have
his
wheels
on
the
ground
-
Come
along,
Eve.
I
think
I
left
my
earrings
upstairs.
We
can
get
out
through
the
window.
What
are
you
doing?
They
know
about
the
shooting.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
figure
they
got
at
the
auction
-
That's
how
he's
been
getting
it.
Whatever
you
do,
don't
get
on
that
plane.
Don't
worry,
Anna.
You
and
your
husband
will
be
ANNA:
Thank
you
very
much,
sir.
ANNA:
EVE:
Thank
you
for
everything.
VANDAMM:
Now,
you're
not
gonna
ANNA:
Thank
you
very
much.
Bye.
Stay
where
you
are.
Sit
down.
As
soon
as
the
plane
leaves,
VANDAMM:
I
was
wondering
about
my
earrings.
VANDAMM:
When
you
return
to
New
York,
And
thank
her
for
her
superb
performance
LEONARD:
I'll
do
that.
...that
I've
reassured
his
wife.
LEONARD:
All
right.

VANDAMM:
The
housekeeper
had
me
pinned
down...
...before
I
realized
-
I
see
you've
got
the
pumpkin.
This
is
no
good.
EVE:
What
do
we
do?
EVE:
ROGER:
Well,
if
we
ever
get
out
of
this
alive...
...let's
go
back
to
New
York
All
right?
Is
that
a
proposition?
It's
a
proposal,
sweetie.
What
happened
My
wives
divorced
me.
-
Why?
-
Ha,
ha.


You
all
right?
All
right,
all
right.
Okay.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
up
here.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.



Help.
Help
me.

Thank
you,
sergeant.
That
wasn't
very
sporting,
Here,
reach.
Now.
-
I'm
trying.
-
Up.
Yes,
you
can.
Come
on.
-
Pull
harder.
-
Oh.
Roger,
this
is
silly.
