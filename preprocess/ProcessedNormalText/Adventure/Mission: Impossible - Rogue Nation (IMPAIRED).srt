BRANDT:

Benji?
Benji,
do
you
copy?
Benji?

BENJI:
Shit.
Uh,
I
can't
talk
right
now.
BRANDT:
The
package
is
on
the

BENJI:
Yeah,
I
know.
We're
currently
formulating
a
plan
B.
This
isn't
going
very
well.
I
am
aware
of
that,
Brandt.
-
Where's
Ethan?
That
plane
cannot
take
off
-
Do
you
understand?
Luther?
You're
supposed
to
be
I
am
in
Malaysia.
-
Benji
needed
my
help.
I
needed
assistance.
The
package
is
still
on
the

BENJI:
We
understand
the
package
-
We're
trying
to
cripple
it
remotely.
We
can
if
the
pilot
left
Which
he
has.
-
And
how
do
you
access
the
uplink?
-
I
can't
authorize
that.
We're
under
investigation
The
package
is
on
board.

Uh,
Luther.
BRANDT:
I'm
reading
-
The
engines
are
starting.
But
I
can't
do
anything
Benji,
you're
connected.
Okay,
great.
The
package
is
still
on
that
plane.
LUTHER:
Shut
down
the
fuel
pump.
BENJI:
Uh,
the
mechanicals
-
What
about
the
electrical
system?
Uh,
no.
-
Hydraulics!
No,
they're
encrypted.
Benji,
the
plane!
Yes!
The
package
is
on
the
plane!
Can
you
open
the
door?
Ethan?
Where
are
you?
ETHAN:
I'm
by
the
plane.
Uh,
can
I
open
the
door?
Uh,
maybe.
Open
the
door
when
I
tell
you!

I'm
on
the
plane.
Open
the
door.
BENJI:
How
did
you
get
in
the
plane?
ETHAN:
Not
in
the
plane.
Open
the
door!
Benji!
Open
the
door!
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Okay,
okay!

-
Benji,
open
that
door
right
now!
-
Come
on,
Benji!
BENJI:
Come
on!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Yes,
got
it!

That's
the
wrong
door!
Benji,
not
that
door.
The
other
door,
right!
Okay,
yes!
Sorry,
my
bad,
my
bad!


Check
it
out.
All
right,
look,
I'm
gonna
open


Hey!
Hey!
We're
about
to
close.
ETHAN:
I
won't
be
long.
Are
you
looking
for
anything
Something
rare.
Let
me
guess.
Classical.
-
Jazz.
-
Coltrane.
Monk.
Shadow
Wilson
on

Shadow
Wilson
played
drums.
Know
why
they
call
him
Shadow?
Because
he
had
a
light
touch.
You're
in
luck.
I
have
a

It
really
is

I've
heard

Do
I
have
that
right,
Agent
Brandt?
I
can
neither
confirm
nor
deny
details
of
any
such
operation
This
was
the
same
week
that
the

I
can
neither

Without

In
fact,
until
this

appoints
you
really
can't
say
much
of
anything,
Well,
I
didn't
write
the
rules,
Mr.
Hunley.
DIRECTOR
HUNLEY:
Mr.
Chairman,

not
just
a
rogue
organization.
It
is
an
outdated
one,
a
throwback
-
and
without
oversight.
-

has
come
to
dissolve
the
IMF...
...and
transfer
their

assets
Mr.

Are
its

less
than

Without

the

laid
out

a
pattern

a
total
disregard

From
where
I
sit,

indistinguishable
from

And
your
results,

or
not,
I'm
afraid

What
are
you
doing

Hmm?

I
said,
what
are
you
doing
here?
What
does

in
you,
I
wonder?
Who
is
"he"?



I
want
to
see
what
he's
made
of.
ETHAN:
Well,
why
don't
you
Vinter?
You
know
who
I
am.
Janik
Vinter.
They
call
you
the
Bone

The
funny
thing
is,
you
were
officially
declared
dead
Nice
shoes,
by
the

Not

Yours.

Our
instructions
were
to
break
him
down...
...not
kill
him.
Some
guys
break
different
than
others.

This
one's
a
fighter.
He'll
die
before
you
turn
him.
Are
you
worried

You
should
go
before
it
gets
ugly.
Yeah,
he's
right.
You
should
go.

So
now
let's
see
how
tough
you
are.
Janik.




We've
never
met
before,
right?

Follow
me.

Give
me
the
gun!
-
What
are
you
doing?
You
can't
stay.
We
didn't
kill
them,
you
did.
I
tried
to
stop
you.
You
got
away.
Who
are
you?
You
better
hurry
now.
Good
luck.
No,
wait!
Wait!

Where
is
he?
He's
heading
towards

DIRECTOR
HUNLEY:
Since

going
I
want
you
to
choose
Where
is

-
I
don't
know.
I
have
no
way
of
contacting
him.
Last
I
heard,
Let's
cut
the
bull.
You
know
who
we
are,
How
come
the
CIA
has
never
discovered
any
actionable
intel
-
What
are
you
implying?
Leveling
an
accusation,
actually.
Hunt
is
both
arsonist
and
fireman
I
believe
that
the
Syndicate
created
to
justify
the
IMF's
existence.
I
am
going
to
find
him,
Brandt,
he
will
be
called
upon

answer
for

wanton
act

Welcome
to

You'll
never
find

Okay.

ask
you

Has
Ethan

contacted

Why
would
he
contact
me?
DIRECTOR
HUNLEY:
This
time
in
Cuba.
He,
uh,
left
these
behind.
Tell
me
what
you
make
of
them.
I
don't
know.
Look
at
the
photographs,
Dunn.
All
of
them
are
either
missing
or
dead.
All
of
them
were

agents.

French,

Israeli,
These
are

and

And
he
always
seems
to
be
I
wonder
how.
-
Are
you
suggesting
I'm
helping
him?
BENJI:
Six
months
I
have
been
here,
sifting
through
mountains
of
metadata
I
have
decrypted,
processed,
parsed
And
yet,
every
week
you
haul
me
in
here
and
you
ask
me
the
same
question,
And
today
you
haven't
answered
it.
You
seem
to
think
Okay.
Nothing
could
be
further
Ethan
Hunt
is
still
out
there
in
the
field,
and
I
am
stuck
here
answering
for
it.
We
are
not
friends.
I
owe
him
nothing.
That'll
be
all,
Dunn.


ETHAN:

Ethan,
where
are
you?
You
know
what?
Because
it's
just
another
thing
I'll
have
Everything's
gonna
be
fine.
But
make
sure
I
didn't
win
those
opera
tickets,
did
I?
No,
I'm
afraid
not.
-
So,
where
do
we
meet'?
For
your
sake,

You
have
mail.
BENJI:
Who
is
he?
we're
here
to
find
out.
What
I
do
know
is
he's
our
And
I
have
reason
to
believe
But
I
can't
find
him
alone.
-
Uh...
Yes,
of
course.
Of
course.
Urn...
So
what's
the
play?
Simple.
You
find
him.
We
tag
him.
And
after
that?
After
that,
you're
on
a
plane.
Back
at
work
Monday
morning.
-
Wait,
that's
it?
I
didn't
want
to
involve
you
this
much,
Well,
if
you're
going
to
bring
me
you
could
at
least
give
me
something
Benji,
we're
trying
to
keep
a
low
profile.
You
want
drama,
go
to
the
opera.

-
Are
you
seeing
what
I'm
seeing?
BENJI:
Am
I
correct
in
assuming
ETHAN:
Yes,
you
are.
BENJI:
Did
you
know
No.
Right.
Well,
we
have
at
the
same
time
as
we
are
looking
And
I'm
sure
that
the
two
things
Benji.
Meanwhile,
I
will
try
and
overlook
you're
an
international
fugitive
And
that
this
little
unsanctioned
Because,
as
you
stated
earlier,
I
will
be
playing
videogames,
-
The
show's
about
to
start,
Benji.
Just
take
your
position.
-
Tell
me
what
you
see.
Nice
tux,
by
the
way.

Okay,
I
have
eyes.
Searching.

Talk
to
me,
Benji.
Nothing
yet.
Stand
by.
I
know
you're
here.
Where
are
you?
Uh,
Ethan,
I
might
have
-
Where?
Take
the
door
on
your
left.
He
should
be
right
in
front
of
you.
Benji,
do
you
see
that?
See
what?
-
That
woman.
I
can't
see
you.

What
was
that?
I
don't
know.

Ethan,
do
you
copy?
Ethan,
come
in!

Ethan,
the

booth!
Ethan,
do
you

It's
just
a

Seal
the
building.
Close
the
exits.
I
have
a
way
out.
Interested?
Lead
the
way.

Anything
you
want
to
tell
me?
-
How's
the
pace?
What's
next?

There.
Shoes.
Shoes,
please.

Uh...




If
anything
were
to
happen
to
you

Nothing's
going
to
happen
to
me.

STOP
THE

Get
in!
Go,
go,
go.

She
tried
to
shoot
me!
That
doesn't
make
her
a

going
to

-
A

the

Uh,

ETHAN:
Who
is

We're

the
same
thing,
If
you

to
bring
down

Uh,
they're

has
to

HUNLEY:

interviewed

He
was

six
hours

you're
there,

what?
You
came
to

believing
I
attempted
to
recruit
you
-
You
refused.
Your
life
depends
on
It'll
go
easier
Ethan,
at
least
tell
me
You
recognize
anyone?
Him.
He's
former
KSA.
German
intelligence.
Missing,
presumed
dead.
He
was
at
the
opera
tonight.
This
one,
too.
Former
Mossad.
Let
me
guess.
Presumed
dead.
Tonight,
I
made
it
official.
I
was
looking
for
him
in
the
Bosphorus.
The
same
day,
a
car
accident
He
slipped
away
again
in
Jakarta,
hours
before
a
passenger
plane
with
236
passengers.
I
just
missed
him
in
the
Philippines
right
before
a
fire
gassed
a
village
of
2,000
people.
You're
saying
these
accidents
That
missing
plane
was
carrying
That
fire
bankrupted
That
wreck
triggered
a
civil
war.
These
are
no
accidents.
They're
links
in
a
chain.
The
work
of
a
single
organization,
A
rogue
nation,
imbued
with
a
new
sense
of
purpose.
Destroy
the
system
that
created
them
An
anti-IMF.
Since
Hunley
shut
us
down,
Killing
the
Chancellor
tonight
the
start
of
a
new
phase.
Or
they
could
just
be
He
was
there.
Every
time.
Just
like
he
was
there
tonight,
I
don't
know
who
he
is,
where
he's
from,
how
he's
funded.
But
I
know
he's
the
key.
Ethan,
this
is
what
I
signed
up
for.
That's
why
I
brought
you
here
and
look
what
happened!
I
can't
protect
you.
That's
why
I
need
you
to
leave.
That's
not
your
decision
to
make,
Ethan!
I
am
a
field
agent.
I
know
the
risks.
More
than
that,
I
am
your
friend,
no
matter
what
I
tell
Now,
you
called
me
And
you
still
do.
So
I
am
staying.
And
that
is
all
Okay.
Good.
Where
do
we
start?
Ilsa.
Right.
And
how
do
we
find
her?
She
said
we
have
everything
we
need.


We
had
an
agreement.
You
send
me
to
do
a
job,
I
do
it.
Where
did
I
deviate?
You
put
two
more
gunmen
One
of
them
tried
to
kill
me.
You
missed.
I
missed
because
Ethan
Hunt
was
there
Ethan
Hunt's
in
Vienna
because
Vinter
would
have
killed
him
in
London,
Twice
now
you've
let
him
slip
away.
Curious.
Are
you
questioning
my
loyalty
-
Can't
decide.
But
if
you're
going
to
kill
me,
be
a
man.
Do
it
yourself.

Did
he
say
anything?
He
knows
about
Morocco.
What
does
he
know
about
Morocco?
He
knows
about
the
power
plant.
Find
him,
please.
He'll
find
me.
I've
seen
to
that.
That's
interesting.

What
is
it?
A
secure
computer
facility.
It's
impossible
to
hack
into
It's

Where's

Morocco.

And
what

you
gentlemen
Good
to
see
you.
What
couldn't
you
tell
me
The
Chancellor
of
Austria
We
believe
that
Hunley
has
handed
this
over
We
need
to
find
Ethan
before
they
do.
And
that's
where
you
come
in.
Not
interested.
-
Okay,
look,
Luther...
I
don't
know
you.
All
I
know
about
you
Yeah.
All
I
know
about
you

You
don't
have
to
worry
No,
they're
not
gonna
catch
him.
No.
This
is
the
CIA.
Things
are
out
of
control.
They're
going
to
kill
Ethan.
We
have
to
get
to
them
first.
You
need
to
understand
something.
Ethan
is
my
friend.
And
if
I
have
one
second
of
doubt
Mmm?
I
believe
you.
-
All
right.
What
do
I
have
to
go
on?
Not
much.
And
not
a
lot
of
time.

He

Where
does
he
come
from?
He's

Well,
if
British
intelligence
knows
why
don't
they
just
tell
the
CIA?
Because
they
don't

And
for
the

in

years,
Lane

It
contained

One
of
his
agents
stole
it,
and
kept
it
in
a
secure
computer
facility
He
died

interrogated
leaving
Lane
with
a
serious
problem.
So
the
key
to
crushing
Lane
is
sitting
in

So,
why
hasn't
Lane
Oh,
he
has.
He

And
I
can
tell
you
it's
impossible.

BENJI:
So,
what
you're
saying
is
We're

we

Okay.
So,
to

needs
to
enter

change

that

-
You'll
be

Look,

we'd

it.

Listen,
I

want
to
I
appreciate
everything
you
do

but
one

got

We're
gonna

BRANDT:
I
thought
you
said
LUTHER:
I
said
I

-
You
have

Where's
Hunt?
He's
dead.
That
really
hurts!
-
Can
you
walk?
We
have
to
get

BENJI:
Whoa.
Whoa.
Are
you
okay
to
drive?
What
are
you
talking
about?
This
is
not
going
to
end
well.
-
There
she
is!

stairs!
Ah!
God
damn
it!


Whoa.


We
found
him.
LUTHER:
Oh,
come
on,
man!
Shit!
It's
a
high-speed
chase!
You
just
had
to
get

-
Don't
blame
me.
You
chose
the

-
Do
you
want
me
to

LUTHER:
Look
how
slow
you're
going.
Who's
this
guy?
Shit!
Oh!
Ahhh!
Go!
Go!
Go!
I'm
okay!
I'm

I'm

We're

Oh,
hey,
boys,
what
did
I
miss?
-
Ooh,
that
looks
sharp.
Careful!
Careful!





So
what
do
we
do
now?
Please
tell
me
Of
course
I
made
a
copy.
So
where
are
we
going?

It's
a
ledger.
Who
they
are,
and
where
the
money
comes
from.
What
makes
you
think
Why
would
Lane
want
it
so
badly
Why
would
he
ever
Did
you
never
stop
to
consider
Misinformation,
manipulation,
It's
what
he's
trained
to
do.
Lane
lies
to
you,
Together,
you're
both
compromised.
This
may
be
authentic.
But
there's
only
one
person
I
trust
No.
My
orders
were
to
deliver
you
Your
orders
were
that
we
may
learn
more
This
isn't
proof.
The
only
way
to
pass
is
to
go
back.
I
can't
do
that.
I've
betrayed
Lane's
trust
And
in
every
instance,
He
was
going
to
torture
and
kill
And
you
should
have
let
him.
This
is
the
trade.
Hunt
understands
that.
I
wasn't
going
to
let
him
die.
There
are
no
allies
in
statecraft,
Ilsa,
As
it
stands,
Ethan
Hunt
is
a
man
This
makes
killing
him
Are
you
ordering
me
to
kill
Hunt?
Good
God,
no.
Lane
will
order
you.
And
to
regain
his
trust,
you
will
do
it.
You
sent
me
to
do
a
job.
I
did
it.
Now
you
bring
me
in!
Might
I
remind
you,
The
Director
of
the
CIA
called
me,
Of
course,
to
protect
your
cover,
So,
as
far
as
the
Americans
you're
a
rogue
assassin,
Precious
few
people
know
It
would
be
unfortunate
if
we
forgot.
You
see,
there
really
is
no
choice,
Ilsa.
You're
going
back.
Glad
to
know
you're
still
with
us.
-
ETHAN:
What's
happening?
-
What
do
you
mean,
you
can't
open
it?
That's
a
red
box.
-
A
what?
The
British
government
uses
them
-
Doesn't
sound
good.
You're
not
getting
into
that
thing
unless
you
have
fingerprints,
and
a
voice
phrase
spoken
The
Prime
Minister
Yes,
him.
So
what
you're
saying
is
which
means
we
have
no
proof
So
we're
back
to
square
one,
I'm
so
proud
of
us.
BENJI:
What
I
don't
understand
is
sat
in
a
private
data
vault
in
Morocco?
And
why
would
Lane
want
it
If
Lane
wants
it,
And
we
just
helped
him
steal
it.
He's
going
to
take
the
Prime
Minister.
Yes,
he
is.
The
question
is
how.
Well,
we
have
to
warn
Yeah,
MI6.
No,
Brandt.
Put
down
the
phone.
We
have
a
responsibility
and
not
gamble
just
so
you
can
beat
the
guy
Is
that
what
you
think
this
is?
Brandt?
Is
that
what
you
think
this
is?
I
think
right
now
you're
incapable
And
sometimes
Ethan
is
the
only
one
And
if
he
is
wrong,
You
don't
know
him.
If
he
wants
something
to
happen,
That's
why
we
have
to
warn
the
British.
Maybe
that's
exactly
Are
you
listening
to
yourself?
No.
We're
going
to
find
Lane,
before
he
takes
the
Prime
Minister.
Okay.
All
right,
Ethan.
But
please
tell
me

All
is
forgiven.
That
isn't
a
ledger,
is
it?
You
didn't
take
a
look
for
yourself?
Of
course
I
did,
And
why
would
I
lie
to
you?
So
that
I
would
lie
to
Hunt.
But
he
wouldn't
have
stolen
it
And
you
wouldn't
have
helped
him.
What
is
actually
on
that
disk?
I'll
be
honest
with
you
Now,
you
and
I
both
know
Hmm?
You're
still
alive
But
I'm
growing
impatient.
Why
do
you
continue
to
resist?
Well,
if
we're
being
honest,
If
that
were
true,
But
my
method
is
far
more
surgical.
You
kill
innocent
people.
I
helped
my
government
kill
So
much
more.
Killing
to
keep
things
as
they
were.
And
now
I'm
killing
I
think
Ethan
Hunt
would
disagree.
Ethan
Hunt
is
a
gambler.
and
thousands
of
innocent
people
Which
one
of
us
will
be
the
villain
then?
Nothing
here.
It's
empty.

I'm
interested
to
see
who
you
blame
for
what
happens
next.
So
that's
her?
That's
her.
I
have
to
say
you
sure
can
ride.
-
Ethan...
That's
all
we're
going
to
say
about
it.
Atlee
said
you
would
understand.
Atlee.
And
he
didn't
bring
you
in,
even
after
you
gave
him
the
disk.
You
knew
perfectly
well
it
was
blank.
BENJI:

The
disk
she
took
from
me
Was
it
in
your
possession

They
don't
care
if
you
live
or
die.
But
you
knew
I
hoped
you
would.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
That
means
I
have
a
question.
If
the
disk
was
blank,
Unless,
of
course,
So
who
you
working
for
now?
Lane,
Atlee,
your
government,
We
only
think
because
that's
what
So
where
does
that
leave
us?
The
way
I
see
it,
One,
you
hand
me
I
am
proof
the
Syndicate
exists.
Lane
becomes
their
problem
-
My
thoughts
exactly.
But
you
know
And
you'll
all
be
tried
for
treason.
Lane
goes
free.
I'm
afraid
she
has
a
point.
Two,
you
let
me
walk
away
You
use
the
disk
as
bait
to
trap
Lane.
But
some
part
of
you
suspects
And
being
a
gambler,
you'll
probably
whether
you
want
to
or
not.
That
is
entirely
possible.
And
option
three?
Come
away
with
me.
Right
now.
Oh,
boy.
And
what
about
Lane?
Forget
about
Lane.
There
will
always
be
another
Lane.
There
will
always
be
people
like
us
We've
done
our
part
We
can
be
anyone.
We
can
do
anything.
It's
only
a
matter
of
going.
Lane
sent
you
to
deliver
a
message,
I've
saved
your
life
twice.
What's
the
message?
-

ETHAN:
Benji.

Parking
garage.
Luther,
stay
with
her!
She's
gone.
I
lost
her.
She
set
us
up,
Ethan.
No.
She
delivered
a
message.
She
set
us
up!
Only
Lane
knows

LANE:
I
have
a
job
for
you,
Ethan.
And
for
the
sake
of
your
friend,
I'm
listening.
Your
mission,
is
to
bring
me
the
unlocked
disk
Now
say
the
words,
please.
I
accept.
Yes.
I
knew
you
would.
-

He
wants
the
disk,
unlocked,
Ethan,
there's
only
one
person
on
Earth
We
have
to
take
the
Prime
Minister.

Let's
just
think
about
that
It's
the
only
way
to
get
Benji
back.
Ethan,
that's
exactly
Which
is
why
it
has
to
happen.
This
is
how
we
beat
Lane.
This
is
how
we
make
everything
right.
Can
you
see?
Can't
you
see
it?

William
Brandt,
sir.
I
had
a
feeling
I'm
only
calling
you
I'm
trying
to
prevent
a
catastrophe.
I
can
understand
that.
Where
are
you?

-
London.
-
Where
in
London?
I'm
not
interested
And
I'm
not
interested
So
if
I'm
going
to
betray
them,
and
my
terms
only.
Do
you
understand?
Keep
your
phone
on.

LUTHER:
You
should've
been
gone
Yeah.
You
okay?
We're
supposed
to
take
down
the
Prime
Minister
So...
ETHAN:
Brandt?
I
can't
see
another
way.
Neither
can
I.
But
we
do
what
we
have
to
do


Get
him
ready,
please.
You
were
right
to
call
me,
Brandt.
He's
on
his
way.
-
What
does
he
intend
to
do?
And
I
need
your
reassurance

Have
you
informed
that
Hunt
has
targeted
I
will
help
you
capture
him
alive.
You've
picked
up
some
terrible
habits
the
worst
of
them
being
that
you
still
Stay
with
him.
Chief
Atlee!
Chief
Atlee.
Director
Hunley,
Last
time
we
spoke,
you
were

I
have

to

that
I'm
listening.

Under

is

for

Ilsa
Faust,

If
you
don't
mind
my
asking,
what
do
Uh,
sir,
this
is
William
Brandt,
He
came
forward
with
firsthand
Sir,
Hunt
is
in
possession
that
can
only
be
opened
by
you.
He
believes
it
is
the
key
The
Syndicate,
you
say?
BRANDT:
Yes,
sir.
Atlee?
He
couldn't
possibly
be
talking
about
that
Syndicate.
Because
you
assured
me
that
And
it
was,
Prime
Minister,
And
yet
here
we
have
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
I
don't
understand.
Prime
Minister,
your
life
is
in
danger.
I
think
our
first
priority
is
to
move
you
Sir,
does
the
name
Solomon
Lane
Yes.
Unfortunately,
it
does.
So
there
actually
is
a
Syndicate?
It
was
the
hypothetical
brainchild
Recruit
former
agents
supply
them
with
a
new
identity,
and
use
them
to
surgically
remove
Its
operating
budget
in
a
virtual
red
box
It
would
have
made
me
with
zero
accountability.
I
rejected
the
proposal,
unequivocally.
Furthermore,
it
never
passed
the
planning
stage.
Prime
Minister,
there
is
no
Syndicate.
These
men
have
been
duped
Atlee!
Save
it
for
the
public
inquiry.
Sir,
I
urge
you
not
to
leave
this
room.
-
Excuse
me.
Hunt
is
uniquely
trained
A
specialist
without
equal,
There
is
no
secret
he
cannot
extract.
No
security
he
cannot
breach.
He
has,
most
likely,
and
is
waiting
to
strike
Sir,
Hunt
is
the
living
manifestation
And
he
has
made
you
his
mission.
ATLEE:
Prime
Minister?

Hunt.
Sir,
please
step
away
Just
relax,
sir.
-
Atlee
shot
me.
Hunt,
I
hope
you
realize
you've
set
back
US-UK
relations
Desperate
times,

I'm
here.
-
ETHAN:
Stand
by
to
receive.
The
Prime
Minister's
office
asked
me
This
way,
sir.
Scanning.
Retinal
scan
confirmed.
Mmm.
It's
okay.
Here
you
go,
sir.
You've
got
a
very
warm
hand.
LUTHER:
Biometric
confirmed.
The
prompt
is
"Kipling."
Sir,
I'm
going
to
need
a
pass-phrase.
PRIME
MINISTER:
Yes,
of
course.
"If
you
can
keep
your
head
when
"If
you
can
trust
yourself
-
You
got
it?
Oh,
man,
do
I
got
it.
I'm
here
to
see
the
Prime
Minister.
We
were
told
not
to
let
anybody
in.
-
By
whom?
ATLEE:
Hunley?
What
is
this?
Security!

ETHAN:
Chief
Atlee.
Kind
of
you
to
accept
our
invitation.
Ah.
Do
you
know
who
I
am?
We
know
you
created
the
Syndicate.
But
Lane
went
rogue
And
you've
been
That's
why
you
erased
the
disk
That's
true.
Now,
Director
Hunley
has
some
Namely,
how
you
framed
her.
That's
also
true.
It's
the
antidote.
When
the
Prime
Minister
found
out
Atlee
attacked
him.
Yes,
that's
true.
And
then
you
saved
PRIME
MINISTER:
Did
he?
I'm
very
grateful.
Sir.

You're
cutting
it
very
close,
Ethan.
I
have
what
you
want.
Where
do
I
go?

Ethan,
wait.
If
I'm
not
there
in
15
minutes,
The
mission
If
Lane
gets
his
hands
on
that
money,
He'll
never
take
me
alive.

And
what
happens,
I'll
make
it
back.
Just
be
ready.

Careful.
BENJI:

Your

no

Your

When

No

Ethan.
LANE:
Have
a
seat,
please.
Human
nature.
My
weapon
of
choice.
From
the
moment
I
killed
the
young
lady
-
I
knew
you
would...
I
also
knew
Ilsa
wouldn't
have
a
choice.
Whether
she
broke
you
whether
you
let
her
run
in
Morocco,
whether
she
went
to
Atlee
or
not...
You
were
certain
we'd
end
up
Then,
again,
so
was
I.
I
know
you,
Lane.
Somewhere
along
the
line,
Human
life
didn't
matter
anymore.
Either
way,
without
ever
asking
You
blame
the
system
for
what
you
are,
You
wanted
revenge,
You
needed
help.
And
you'll
stop
at
nothing
to
get
it.
That's
how
I
know
Where's
the
disk?
Where
is
the
disk?
ETHAN:
You
like
to
play
games.
I
have
a
game
for
you.
I'll
give
you
$50
million
to
let
Benji
go.
Where
is
the
disk?
Where
is
the
disk?
You're
looking
at
it.
I
am
the
disk.
I
memorized
it.
If
that
vest
goes
off,
you
get
nothing.
Without
this
money,
you're
nothing.
Right
now,
you're
thinking
it's
a
bluff.
I'd
never
let
my
friends
die.
I
couldn't
possibly
memorize
There's
only
one
way
to
be
sure.
Let
Benji
go.

Take
him.
They
come
one
step
closer,
shoot
me.
Stop!
You
remember
I
told
you
one
day
This
is
me
speaking,
by
the
way,
The
only
way
this
ends
is
you
and
me,
Only
this
time,
You
want
your
money?
The
Bone
Doctor
-
beat
it
out
of
me!
Now
let
Benji
go.
1-3-9...
-
Go.
Brandt
and
Luther
are
waiting.
Go.
What
do
I
do?
Kill
the
woman.
I
need
Hunt
alive.


-
Go!
-
They're
coming.
Then
get
ready.



Which
way?


-



Now
let's
see
what
you're
made
of.



-



Face
to
face,
just
as
you
wished,
Ethan.

It
hurts,
I
know.
Gentlemen,
this
is
Solomon
Lane.
Mr.
Lane,
meet
the
IMF.

You're
free
now.
Where
will
you
go?
I
don't
know.
I've
done
my
part.
Yeah.

Ethan,
we
got
to
go!
You'd
better
hurry
now.
Good
luck.
You
know
how
to
find
me.
MR.

Hunley?
Director
Hunley!

Mr.

MR.
CHAIRMAN:

months

demanded

HUNLEY:
How
do
you
explain
It's
quite
simple,
really.
the
Syndicate
had
infiltrated
In
order
for
our
man
his
cover
had
to
be
absolute.
The
whole
operation
was
known
only
to
myself
So
the
shuttering
of
the
IMF
to
expose
the
so-called
Syndicate.
That
is
correct,
sir.
Which
is
why
you're
here
today
That
is
correct,
sir.
I'm
not
sure
the
Committee
approves
Uh,
desperate
times,
And
you,
Mr.
Brandt,
I
can
neither
confirm
nor
deny
without
the
Secretary's
approval.
Welcome
to
the
IMF,
Mr.
Secretary.
