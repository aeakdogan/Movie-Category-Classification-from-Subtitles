Our
sun
is
dying.
Mankind
faces
extinction.
Seven
years
ago,
the
Icarus
Project
But
that
mission
was
lost
Sixteen
months
ago,
I,
Robert
Capa,
...left
Earth
frozen
in
a
solar
winter.
Our
payload...
...a
stellar
bomb
with
the
mass
Our
purpose...
...to
create
a
star
within
a
star.
Eight
astronauts
strapped
My
bomb.
Welcome
to
Icarus
II.
Icarus.
Yes,
Dr.
Searle?
Please
re-filter
Filter
up
or
down,
Dr.
Searle?
Down.
Oh,
my.
Icarus,
how
close
is
this
At
this
distance
of
36
million
miles...
...you
are
observing
the
sun
Two
percent?
Can
you
show
me
4
percent?
Four
percent
would
result
in
However,
you
could
observe
...for
a
period
of
not
longer
than
All
right.
Icarus,
I'm
gonna
reset...
...the
filter
to
3.1
percent.
Well,
it's
invigorating.
It's
like
taking
a
shower
in
light.
-
You
lose
yourself
a
little.
Actually,
no.
Look,
what
is
it,
beef?
Chicken.
If
you
don't
like
it,
For
psych
tests
on
deep
space,
Testing
total
darkness
And
the
point
about
darkness
is,
You
and
the
darkness
are
distinct
...because
darkness
is
an
absence
But
total
light,
it
envelops
you.
It
becomes
you.
It's
very
strange.
I
don't...
I
recommend
it.
What's
strange,
Searle,
...and
I'm
clearly
a
lot
saner
Good.
All
right,
if
no
one's
gonna
say
it,
The
solar
wind
reading
is
much
higher
For
the
moment
we
can
still
send
High-frequency
bursts
will
rise
...and
the
Moon
Stations
But
it's
possible
that
within
24
hours
Possible?
Probable.
We'll
finally
be
on
our
own.
We're
55
million
miles
from
Earth.
Come
on,
guys.
No
great
drama.
...seven
days
sooner
But
if
any
of
you
are
planning
...you
should
do
it
now.
Well,
Mom
and
Dad.
I
hope
you're
proud
of
your
son...
...saving
mankind
and
so
on.
By
the
time
you
get
this
message,
It
came
a
little
sooner
But
this
means
that
you
won't
be
able
So
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
Because
I
know
everything
Just
remember
it
takes
eight
minutes
Which
means
you'll
know
...about
eight
minutes
All
you
have
to
do
is
look
out
So,
if
you
wake
up
one
morning,
...you'll
know
we
made
it.
Okay.
I'm
signing
out.
And
I'll
see
you
in
a
couple
of
years.
Icarus,
dial
it
down
a
little,
will
you?
Yes,
Corazon.
Captain?
Captain?
I'm
guessing
you've
been
-
So,
do
you
have
that
report
for
me?
Right
here.
The
O2
productivity
is
good.
In
fact,
It
will
trail
off
dramatically
But
in
truth,
we
have
the
reserves
You're
thinking
about
Icarus
I.
Well,
whatever
it
was
...I
don't
think
Not
on
the
outward
journey,
Fuck.
Fuck.
-
Mace.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
Fuck.
You
son
of
a
bitch.
-
Fucker
took
an
hour
in
there.
I
can't
send
my
package,
-
Calm
down.
Kaneda,
Searle,
report
to
Flight
Deck.
What's
up?
We
have
an
excess
of
manliness
So
how
does
this
work?
Am
I
supposed
to
tell
you
I
probably
know
more
It's
the
time.
Sixteen
months,
You
just...
...lose
track.
I
know
I
fucked
up.
From
now
on...
...I'm
not
gonna
lose
track
again.
Prescription...
...Earth
Room.
Two
hours?
-
And
get
a
haircut,
Mace.
Bring
back
the
waves.
Dr.
Searle's
prescription
specifies
The
waves
make
me
feel
peaceful.
Again.
Mace,
I'm
sorry.
Capa.
It's
me.
All
right.
-
Was
that
the
apology?
-
Consider
it
accepted.
It
was
a
sequence
of
contact
reports
...which,
by
1700,
had
turned
None
bigger
than
a
raindrop...
...but
we
had
19
punctures...
...and
a
secondary
contact
Took
three
alpha
shifts
to
patch
it
up.
Lost
a
little
vapor.
Nothing
serious.
I
watched
them
hit
us
Gotta
tell
you,
Moon
Base,
it
was...
It
was...
...beautiful.
Gotta
tell
you,
Moon
Base,
it
was...
It
was...
...beautiful.

Mace?
Your
maintenance
program
...for
the
mainframe
panel
Shit.
Guys...
...you
wanna
see
something?
Well,
I
should
have
...but
on
reflection...
...what
can
one
say?
Ladies
and
gentlemen.
Mercury.
Twenty-three
hours
ago,
While
listening
to
your
space
music?
-
While
scanning
the
frequencies,
It
appeared
as
we
flew
The
iron
content
of
the
planet...
...is
acting
as
an
antenna.
There's
high
background
interference,
Icarus,
please
play
audio
file
7-5/B.
Yes,
Harvey.
End
file.
What
is
it?
It's
the
Icarus
I.
That
signal
is
their
distress
beacon.
Jesus.
That's
impossible.
Clearly
it's
not
impossible
-
They're
still
alive?
But
they
could
be.
Water
is
recycled.
They
have
the
solar
power
What
about
food?
That
depends.
They
had
stock
to
cover
eight
people
That's
a
four-year
shortfall.
We
don't
know
what
happened
There
might
have
been
an
accident.
There
might
not
have
been
-
Captain,
do
we
know
where
they
are?
Icarus.
Please
plot
our
trajectory
following
Yes,
captain.
Now
plot
the
source
Jesus.
They
almost
made
it.
That's
why
no
one
picked
up
It
was
lost
in
the
background
light
We're
gonna
pass
right
by
them.
Within
1
o
or
15
thousand
miles.
Can
anyone
survive?
If
the
shield
is
intact.
We'll
be
able
to
see
them?
Yes.
I'd
need
to
look
at
all
of
this
But
if
I
had
to
make
a
guess
right
now,
We
could
fly
straight
to
them.
But
we're
not
gonna
do
that.
Just
to
make
it
absolutely
clear,
Do
I
have
to
spell
it
out
for
you?
We
have
a
payload
to
deliver
We're
doing
it
And
if
it
dies,
we
die.
Everything
dies.
So
that
is
our
mission.
...literally
nothing,
more
important
than
-
He's
right.
Is
anyone
here
seriously
-
May
I
put
a
counter
argument?
Captain?
Go
ahead.
It
would,
of
course...
...be
absurd
to
alter
our
trajectory
Even
if
we
knew
that
some
or
...their
lives
are
expendable
As
are
our
own
lives.
-
Exactly.
...there
is
something
onboard
the
As
you
pointed
out,
Mace,
A
payload.
Singular.
Now,
everything
about
the
delivery
...is
entirely
theoretical.
Simply
put...
...we
don't
know
if
it's
gonna
work.
But
what
we
do
know
is
this...
...if
we
had
two
bombs,
You're
assuming
-
Yes.
...that
whatever
stopped
them
wasn't
-
Yes.
It
is.
It's
a
risk
assessment.
The
question
is:
Does
the
risk
of
a
detour
outweigh
-
We'll
have
a
vote.
No,
we
won't.
We
are
not
a
democracy.
We're
a
collection
of
astronauts
So
we're
gonna
make
the
most
Made
by
you,
by
any
chance?
Made
by
the
person
best
qualified
...of
a
payload
delivery.
Our
physicist.
Shit.
Okay,
Icarus,
run
the
math
on
the
Okay,

Detach

That's
the

right
there.
Between

great...
...space
and
time
Everything
will
distort,
You
have
to
come
down
on
one
side
-
I
need
a
decision.
It's
like
flipping
a
coin
and
asking
me
And?
Heads.
We've
mined
all
Earth's
fissile
There's
not
gonna
be
The
one
we
carry
is
our
last
chance.
Our
last
best
hope.
Searle's
argument
is
sound.
Two
last
hopes
are
better
than
one.
That's
it.
Slingshot
complete.
Icarus
leaving
Mercury
orbit.
Hey.
Hey.
Good
dream?
Let
me
guess.
The
surface
of
the
sun?
Only
dream
I
ever
have.
Every
time
I
shut
my
eyes
Maybe
you
should
talk
See
if
he
can
help
you
out.
Maybe.
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know...
...I
think
you
made
the
right
decision.
Well.
Mace
doesn't
and
I'm
guessing
Harvey
Yeah...
...but
I
do.
-
Get
the
alarm.
What's
going
on?
It's
not
you.
It's
my
responsibility.
-
We
shouldn't
be
straying.
In
order
to
change
the
route,
So
I
made
all
the
calculations
myself.
They
all
worked
out.
So
I
set
the
new
coordinates
What's
the
problem?
The
trajectory
is
good.
But
it
changes
our
angle
of
approach
You
didn't
reset
the
shields
Jesus
Christ,
Trey.
I
forgot.
My
head
was
full
of
velocities
and
fuel
I
fucked
up,
all
right?
People
do
shit.
They
get
stressed...
...and
fuck
up.
I
fucked
up.
Trey.
The
fact
is,
we're
still
alive.
A
hole
hasn't
burnt
We
don't
have
-
So,
what's
the
actual
damage?
Icarus
tried
to
reset
the
shields
But
all
the
sensors
up
there
are
So
we
have
no
idea
of
the
state
Only
way
we're
gonna
know
Okay.
I'll
get
suited
up.
It's
a
two-man
job.
As
second
in

-
I
volunteer.
Fine.
I
volunteer
Capa.
Sure.
I'll
do
it.
Okay.
Okay.
You've
done
this
a
thousand
times
Yeah.
You're
gonna
be
fine.
Okay?
Okay,
Icarus.
I'm
gonna
be
taking
-
Okay,
Cassie.
I'm
gonna
rotate
us
so
the
damage
-
Do
we
understand
each
other?
Rotate
by
that
much,
we're
gonna
Well,
it's
a
good
thing
We
don't
need
them
now,
We'll
cross

In
the

I'm
gonna

I
don't
think
any
of
us
As
second

Thanks
both
to
Kaneda...
...and
Capa,
our
shields
are
intact.
As
is
the
payload.
But
the

garden
In
addition,
a
large
amount
of
O2
As
it
stands
now...
...we
don't
have
enough
oxygen
reserves
Let
alone
to
survive
So
cancel
the
ticker-tape
parade.
We
now
have
no
choice
If
we're
gonna
complete
...the
Icarus
I
is
our
only
hope.
Technically,
he
made
a
mistake.
What
are
you
trying
to
say,
Cory?
Harvey
said
there's
not
enough
oxygen
But
there
is.
There
just
isn't
enough
oxygen
Are
you
suggesting
No.
And
in
any
case...
...Trey
wouldn't
be
enough.
We
need
to
lose
two
more.
Three
out
of
seven.
Capa,
it's
me.
It's
different.
Being
afraid
And
then
knowing
that
you
won't.
Our
survival
depends
No.
We're
gonna
die
out
here.
Like
the
other
crew.
I
know
it.
So
do
you.
Are
you
scared?
When
the
stellar
bomb
is
triggered...
...very
little
will
happen
at
first.
And
then
a
spark
...and
it
will
hang
for
an
instant,
...it
will
split
into
two.
And
those
will
split
again...
...and
again
and
again.
Detonation
beyond
all
imagining.
A
big
bang
on
a
small
scale.
A
new
star
born
out
of
a
dying
one.
I
think
it'll
be
beautiful.
No.
I'm
not
scared.
I
am.
Searle,
Capa,
they're
waiting
for
you.
Okay,
let's
go.
Be
careful,
watch
your
step.
Cassie,
are
you
getting

Getting
what?
The
air.
It's
full
of
dust.
Human
skin.
What?
Eighty
percent
of
all
dust
Sorry.
-
No
lights?
No
surprise.
Anyone
afraid
of
the
dark?
We
should
split
up.
I'm
not
sure
that's
such
a
good
idea.
Yeah,
probably
right.
Might
get
picked
off
one
at
a
time
Icarus
I
is
a
big

We
can't
search
it
Okay.
You're
right.
Mace,
head
up
for
the
Flight
Deck,
Searle,
check
the
social
area
Capa,
aim
for
the
payload.
I'll
check
the
garden.
Let's
keep
in
contact,
guys.
Listen
up,
everybody.
You
gotta
see
this.
Can
you
see
this?
It's
an
ecosystem
working
beautifully
You
seeing
this
readout,
It's
wonderful.
Oh,
my
God.
Cory,
look
at
the
ferns.
That's
strange.
Subsystems
are
fine.
The

My
God.
You
can
hardly

it's
so
thick.
I
am
Pinbacker.
Commander
of
the
Icarus
I.
We
have
abandoned
our
mission.
Our
star
is
dying.
All
our
science...
...all
our
hopes...
...our
dreams,
are
foolish.
In
the
face
of
this...
...we
are...
...dust.
Nothing
more.
And
to
this
dust,
we
will
return.
When
he
chooses
for
us
to
die.
It
is
not
our
place...
...to
challenge
God.
Okay,
that

sense
to
anyone?

That
would
be

Say
again,
Capa?
The
payload
is
fully
operational.
That's
great
news.
No,
we
don't.
Go
ahead,
Mace?
I
know
what
caused
There's
a
coolant
failure
of
some
kind.
...it
doesn't
matter
that
Capa
Without
the
mainframe,
we
can't
fly.
It's
been
sabotaged.
We
should
never
have
I
have
something
to
say.
Found
the
crew.
What
happened?
They
had
an
epiphany.
They
saw
the
light.
They
burned
themselves.
No
shit.
I
suspect
the

we

What
was
that?
We
have
a
major
incident.
We
are
floating
free
from
you.
Repeat,
we
are
floating
free.
All

back
to

Cassie.
We
don't
know
why.
The

I
I
can
hold
our
position
but
we
aren't
There's
another
thing,
guys.
You've
got
a
breach,
I
can
see
it.
We're
screwed.
No,
we're
not.
One
of
us
isn't,
anyway.
What
happened?
Airlock's
destroyed.
-
Why
Capa?
I'm
not
a
low
priority.
You're
a
comms
officer
on
a
ship
I
am
the
captain.
The
mission
needs
a
captain
Harvey,
Capa's
the
only
person
outside
There
is
no
choice.
No,
there's
no
choice
for
you.
Capa,
I
order
you
to
remove
that
suit.
Get
out
of
the
suit.
That
is
a
direct
order.
I
assure
you,
when
I'm
onboard
Icarus
II
To
what?
The
airlock
is
ripped
in
half.
Once
we
break
that
seal,
Cassie.
Go.
Listen.
We
can't
depressurize
So
the

of
the
gas
Right.
If
you
open
your
airlock
and
And
so
will
we.
Without
suits?
-
Get
as
close
as
you
can.
At
minus
273
degrees
Celsius.
It's
gonna
be
cold.
But
we'll
make
it.
Anyone
got
any
better
ideas?
Copy
that.
Mace.
One
problem.
The
computer's
down.
One
of
us
has
to
manually
From
inside.
Shit.
You're
right.
So,
whatever
happens,
I
see.
I
get
it.
It's
me.
No,
Harvey.
It's
me.
You
okay?
Hey,
Capa.
We're
only
stardust.
Mace,
we're
lined
up.
Everything's
set.
Searle,
are
you
ready?
All
right.
Cassie.
-
Are
you
ready?
Harvey,
keep
your
eyes
shut
Copy.
Let's
do
it.

I

Breathe,

Just
breathe.
Get

Get

-
Breathe,
Mace.
You're
okay,
Mace.
You're
okay,
Mace.
-
Capa,
are
you
all
right?
Let's
get
you
out
of
here.
Searle?
We're
leaving
now.
We're
gonna
complete
the
mission.
We're
all
thinking
of
you,
Searle.
Searle?
We're
gonna
go
now.
We
love
you.
I've
been
through
Icarus's
activity

Double-checked
it.
And
it's
the
same
results.
In
other
words,
unless
Icarus
is
deleting
And
there
was
no
malfunction
Which
means
the
airlock
Cassie
and
I
were
on
the
Flight
Deck.
And
I
was
with
Capa
and
Searle.
And
I
think
we
can
all
assume
Which
leaves
one
possibility.
Trey.
Trey
is
so
doped
up
He
sleeps
for
23
hours
a
day.
-
Why
would
he
do
it?
The
possibility
remains
that
it
was
By
doping
him
up
more?
This
isn't
just
about
the
possibility
There
is
something
else
too.
When
Searle
and
Harvey
died,
If
Trey
dies...
...we'll
have
the
oxygen
At
least
now
we
know
what
happened
-
The
same
thing
that's
happening
here.
What
are
you
trying
to
remind
us
of?
I'll
do
it.
I'm
not
passing
any
bucks.
Do
it
how?
That's
between
me
and
Trey.
We'll
have
a
vote
this
time.
So
you
know
where
I
stand.
And
me.
What
are
you
asking?
That
we
weigh
the
life
of
one
Kill
him.
Cassie?
No.
-
Cassie.
I
know
the
logic.
You're
saying
you
need
my
vote.
I'm
saying
you
can't
have
it.
What
do
we
do?
Oh,
God.
I'm
sorry,
Cassie.
You
make
it
easy
for
him.
Somehow.
Find
a
kindness.
Trey.
Everybody
get
here
now.
He
cut
his
wrists.
He
took
responsibility.
All
these
deaths.
Kaneda.
Searle.
Harvey.
Trey.
None
of
them
would
have
happened
-
What
do
you
want
me
to
say?
I
just
want
you
to
know
that
this...
...belongs
here.
Fuck
you.
Air
is
low.
-
Icarus?
Run
an
update
on

signs
Check

Checking.
Thank
you.
Capa.
-
Yes?
All

are
dying.
We
know
we're
dying.
As
long
as
we
can
live
long
enough
...we're
okay
with
it.
Capa,
warning.
You
will
not

Unknown.
Where
is
the

In
the
Observation
Room.
Are
you
an
angel?
Has
the
time
come?
I've
been
waiting
so
long.
Who
are
you?
Who
am
I?
At
the
end
of
time...
...a
moment
will
come
Then
the
moment
will
pass.
The
man
will
be
gone.
There
will
be
nothing
to
show
...but
stardust.
The
last
man,
alone
with
God.
Am
I
that
man?
My
God.
My
God,
Pinbacker?
Not
your
God.
Mine.
Icarus.
Full

Anyone.
Oh,
my
God.
Icarus?
Warning,
you
do

You
gotta
be
kidding.

A
baby.
A
beautiful
baby.
Icarus,
patch
me
through
to
Mace.
...wonderful
to
show
him.
Or
Cassie
or
Capa.
Icarus?
Don't
fight.
Don't
fight.
Mace?
Capa?
Is
anyone
else
getting
silence
Anybody?
Capa?
Icarus,
why
are
we
in
orbit?
Respond.
What?
Jesus
Christ.
Capa?
Capa?
In
the
suit.
Use
the
hard
link.
In
the
helmet.
Mace?
-
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
I
can't
talk
to
Icarus.
Pinbacker
is
onboard.
He's
trying
to
destroy
the
mission.
Mace,
listen.
Jesus
Christ.
The
mechanism
is
disabled.
I
can't
lower
the
mainframe
panels.
Mace,
repeat,
please.
Icarus
is
gonna
burn
out.
Mace.
Mace,
come
in.
Come
on.
Capa.
-
Capa.
We're
in
orbit.
The
computer
is
down.
I
don't
know
if
I
can
get
her
You
have
to
break
us
out
The
only
way
to
do
that...
...is
separate
the
payload.
Force
the
bomb
into
the
sun.
Separate
the
payload.
You'll
have
to
get
to
the
bomb
Unlock
the
airlock,
do
you
copy?
I
don't
know
how,
just
do
it.
Okay.
I'm
gonna
do
this.
Copy,
Mace.
Copy.
Capa.
My
leg.
Oh,
God.
Do
it,
Capa.
Do
it.
Mace.
Come
on.
Only
dream
I
ever
have.
Is
it
the
surface
of
the
sun?
Every
time
I
shut
my
eyes
Cassie?
Cassie?
We're
flying
into
the
sun.
Cassie,
there's
not
much
time.
Where
is
he?
Is
he
here?
For
seven
years
I
spoke
with
God.
He
told
me
to
take
us
all
to
heaven.
No.
Finish
it.
Let's
say
25.
Set
at
25.
Please.
Please.
Hi,
sis.
Kiss
the
kids.
You
guys,
come
on.
It's
time.
So
if
you
wake
up
one
morning...
...and
it's
a
particularly
beautiful
day,
Okay.
I'm
signing
out.
