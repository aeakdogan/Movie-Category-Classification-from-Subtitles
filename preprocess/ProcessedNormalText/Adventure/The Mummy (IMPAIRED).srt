Give

Flies!
Locusts!
Anything

when
Rameses

You

catastrophe!
Look
at
my

Why
do
I
put
up

you?
Well,
you
put
up
with

because
I
can...
I
can
read
and
write
Ancient
Egyptian,
and
I
can...
and,
well,
I
am
the
only

who
knows

I
don't
care
how
you
do
it,
straighten
up
this
meshiver!

Hello?
Abdul?
Mohammed?
Bob?



Have
you
no
respect
for
the
dead?
Of
course
I
do.
Well,
I
wish
you
would
do
it
before
you
ruin
-
Now,
get
out.
I'll
have
you
know
that,
at
this
precise
moment,
High
note,
ha!
Jonathan,
please,
I've
just
made
a
bit
of
a
mess
in
the
library,
and
the
Bembridge

have
They
say
I
don't
have
enough

You'll
always
have
me,

mum.
Besides,
I
have
just
the
thing
Oh,
no,
Jonathan,
If
I
have
to
take
one
more
piece
of
junk
sell
for
you.
Where
did
you
get
this?
On
a
dig
down
in
Thebes.
My
whole
life,
Please
tell
me
I've
found
something.

-
Jonathan.
I
think
you've
found
something.
You
see
the
cartouche
there?
It's
the
official
royal
seal
of
Seti
the
First,
-
Perhaps.
Who
the
hell
was
Seti
the
First,
He
was
the
second
pharaoh
said
to
be
the
wealthiest
pharaoh
Good.
I
Iike
this
fellow.
-
I
like
him
very
much.
It's
almost
3,000
years
old.
And
if
you
Iook
at
the
hieratic
just
here,
CURATOR:
Dear
God,
don't
be
ridiculous.
We're
scholars,
not
treasure
hunters.
Hamunaptra's
a
myth
to
amuse
Greek
and
Roman
tourists.
I
know
all
the
blather
about
the
city
but
my
research
has
led
me
to
believe
-
Are
we
talking
about
the
Hamunaptra?
Where
the
earliest
pharaohs
were
said
Yes,
yes,
in
a
big,
underground
-
Heh!
The
entire
necropolis
was
rigged
to
sink
A
flick
of
a
switch,
and
the
whole
place
taking
the
treasure
with
it?
As
the
Americans
would
say,
Oh,
my
goodness!
Look
at
that!
You'be
burnt
it!
It's
for
the
best,
I'm
sure.
Many
men
have
wasted
their
Iives
No
one's
ever
found
it.
Most
have
never
returned.
Come,
come!
Step
over
the
threshold.
Welcome
to
Cairo
Prison,
my
humble
home.
EVELYN:
You
told
me
that
you
got
it
-
JONATHAN:
Yeah,
well,
I
was
mistaken.
I
lie
to
everybody.
-
I
am
your
sister.
You
stole
it
from
a
drunk
Picked
his
pocket,
actually,
Stop
being
so
ridiculous.
This
I
did
not
know.
But
when
I
heard
that
you
were
coming,
And
what
did
he
say?
He
said
he
was
just
looking
for
a
good
time.

-
This
is
the
man
that
you
stole
it
from?
So
why
don't
we
just
go
sniff
RICK:
Who
are
you?
-
And
who's
the
broad?
I'm
just
a
local
sort
of
missionary
chap,
-
but
this
is
my
sister,
Evy.
-
Oh,
well.
Guess
she's
not
a
total
loss.
I'll
be
back
in
a
moment?
-
Ask
him
about
the
box.
Hello.
Excuse
me?
We
both
found
your
puzzle
box,
and
we've
come
to
ask
you
about
it?
-
No.
No.
You
came
to
ask
me
about
Hamunaptra.
How
do
you
know
Because
that's
where
I
was
when
I
found
it.
But
how
do
we
know
-
Do
I
know
you?
I've
just
got
one
of
those
faces.
You
were
actually
at
Hamunaptra?
-
Yeah,
I
was
there.
-
Every
damn
day.
I
know.
I
was
there.
Seti's
place.
Could
you
tell
me
how
to
get
there?

I
mean,
the
exact
location?
-
You
want
to
know?
-
Do
you
really
want
to
know?
Then
get
me
the
hell
out
of
here!

Do
it,
lady!
-
Where
are
they
taking
him?
Apparently,
he
had
a
very
good
time?

I
will
give
you
100
to
save
this
man's
life.
Madame,
I
would
pay
100
-
200.
300.
Any
last
requests,
pig?
Yeah?
Loosen
the
knot
and
let
me
go.

Of
course
we
don't
let
him
go!

500!
And
what
else?
I'm
a
very
lonely
man.

No!


His
neck
did
not
break.
Oh,
I'm
so
sorry.


He
knows
the
location
to
Hamunaptra.
-
You
lie.
Are
you
telling
me
-
knows
where
to
find
the
City
of
the
Dead?
-
Truly?
And
if
you
cut
him
down,
we
will
give
you...

-
10
%
-
Twenty.
-
Thirty!
Deal.
Cut
him
down!

JONATHAN:
Yes,
undoubtedly,
He
may
be
a
cowboy,
but
I
know
the
breed.
Well,
personally
I
think
he's
filthy,
rude,

I
don't
like
him
one
bit.
Oh.
Hello.
Smashing

for
the
start

Yeah.
Yeah,
smashing.
Oh,
no,
no,
I'd
never
steal
That
reminds
me?
-
Oh,
no,
no.
Happens
all
the
time.
Can
you
look
me
in
the
eye
this
isn't
some
sort
of
a
flimflam?
-
Because
if
it
is,
I
am
warning
you...
Lady,
let
me
put
it

way,
my
whole
damn
garrison

without

they
marched
to
find
that
city
When
we
got
there,
Let
me
get
your
bags.
Yes,
yes,
you're
right.
Filthy,
rude,
a
complete
scoundrel.
Bright
good
morning
to
all.
Oh,
no.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
here
to
protect
my
investment,

Quit
playing
with
your
glasses
Without
my
glasses
JONATHAN:
O'Connell,
sit
down.
-
I
only
gamble
with
my
life,
never
my
money.
What
if
I
was
to
bet
you
$500
-
You're
looking
for
Hamunaptra?
-
And
who
saya
we
are?
DAVE:
Well...
Well,
how
about
it?
Is
it
a
bet?
-
All
right,
you're
on.
-
What
makes
you?
Oh,
what
a
coincidence,
Whose
play
is
it?
Is
it
my
play?
I
thought...
Gentlemen,
we
got
us
a
wager.
Night.
Sorry.
Didn't
mean
to
scare
you.
The
only
thing
that
scares
me,
-
Still
angry
about
that
kiss,
huh?
Did
I
miss
something?
Lady,
there's
something
out
there.
Something
underneath
that
sand.
Yes,
well,
A
book,
actually.
-
What
do
you
think's
out
there?
The
Bedouin
and
the
Tuaregs
believe
Oh,
look,
I
don't
believe
but
I
do
believe
one
of
the
most
The
Book
of
Amun-Ra.
It
contains
within
it
all
It's
what
first
interested
me
in
Egypt
It's
why
I
came
here.
Sort
of
a
life's
pursuit.
And
the
fact
that
they
say
it's
made
out
-
Right.
I
know
my
treasure.
By
the
way,
why
did
you
kiss
me?
I
was
about
to
be
hanged.
What?
What'd
I
say?


Surprise!
My
good
friend,
you're
alive!
-
I
was
so
very,
very
worried.
-
I
think
I'll
kill
you.
You
don't
have
any
children.
-
Someday
I
might.
So,
you're
the
one
I
might
have
known.
You
task
them
into
the
middle
of
the
desert,
Unfortunately,
no.
These
Americans
are
smart.
They
pay
me
only
half
now,
-
So
this
time
I
must
go
all
the
way.
You
never
believed
Why
are
you
going
back?

You
see
that
girl?
She
saved
my

You

than
brains.
Yeah.
Goodbye,

Was...
Oh,
for
heaven's
sake,
girl,


Where
is
the
map?
It's...
It's...
There.
And
the
key?
Where
is
the
key?
The
key?
The
key?
What
key?
RICK:
Evelyn!

The
map!
The
map!
I
forgot
the
map!
Relax.
I'm
the
map?
It's
all
up
here?
Oh,
that's
comforting.

-
The
key!

Hold
on
to
this.

Can
you
swim?
Of
course
I
can
swim,
Trust
me.
It
calls
for
it.



O'Connell!
O'Connell!
-
Wait
here!
I'll
go
get
help!


Americans.
I
say,
bloody
good
show,
chaps!
And
did
I
panic?
I
think
not.
HENDERSON:
Get
them
out
of
the
water!
Come
on,
doggies!
This
is
a
messed-up
country.
We've
lost

All
my

Hey!
O'Connell!
It
Iooks

me
Iike
I've
got
all
the
horses!
Hey,
Beni!
Looks
to
me
Yeah?




JONATHAN:
I
only
want
four!
Four!
I
only
want
four,
not
a
whole
bloody
herd!
O'Connell!
Can
you
believe
the
cheek?
Just
pay
the
man.
Oh,
for
heaven's
sake.
Can't
believe
the
price
of
these
fleabags?
Yes,
happy?
Very
good.
You
probably
could've
got
them
for
free.
-
All
we
had
to
do
was
give
him
your
sister.
Awfully
tempting,
wasn't
it?
Awfully.
JONATHAN:
Never
did
like
camels.
Filthy
buggers.
-
Disgusting.
Oh,
baby









This
one
is
strong.
BENI:
Good
morning,
my
friend.
What
the
hell
we
doing?
Patience,
my
good
barat'm.
Patience.
Remember
our
bet,
O'Connell?
A
hundred
of
them
bucks
is
yours
Oh,
my
pleasure.
Hey,
O'Connell.
Nice
camel.

RICK:
Get
ready
for
it.
-
For
what?
-
Will
you
look
at
that?
Hamunaptra.
Here
we
go
again.

So
long,
Beni!
That
serves
you
right.


Go,
Evy!
Go!




Do
they
know
something
we
don't?
They
are
led
by
a
woman.
EVELYN:
That's
a
statue
of
Anubis.
Its
legs
go
deep
underground.
According
to
Bembridge
scholars,
containing
the
golden
Book
of
Amun-Ra.
Jonathan,
you're
meant
to
catch
the
sun
-
So,
what
are
these
old
mirrors
for?
It's
an
ancient
Egyptian
trick.
You'll
see.
Here,
this
for
you.
Go
ahead.
It's
something
I
thought
you
might
like
it,
Yeah?
What
are
you
looking
at?
WARDEN:
Hey,
look
for
bugs.
I
hate
bugs.
EVELYN:
Do
you
realize
no
one
has
entered
in
over
3,000
years?
What
is
that
god-awful
stench?

And
then
there
was
light?
RICK:
Hey,
that
is
a
neat
trick.
-
Oh,
my
God.
It's
a
sah-netjer.
-
A
preparation
room.
For
entering
the
afterlife.
Mummies,
my
good
son.

What
the...
JONATHAN:
What
was
that?
Sounds
like
bugs.
-
EVELYN:
He
said
bugs?
EVELYN:
The
legs
of
Anubis.
The
secret
compartment
should
be
hidden



You
scared
the
bejesus
Likewise.
-
Hey,
that's
my
tool
kit.
Okay?
Perhaps
I
was
mistaken.
Have
a
nice
day,
gentlemen.
We
have
a
lot
of
work
-
Push
off!
This
is
our
dig
site?
This
here's
our
statue,
friend.
I
don't
see
your
name
written
on
it,
pal.
BENI:
Yes,
well,
there's
only
four
of
you
and
15
of
me.
Your
odds
are
not
so
great,
O'Connell.
-
I've
had
worse.
Oh,
look,
for
goodness'
sake,
If
we're
going
to
play
together,
There
are
other
places
to
dig.
According
to
these
hieroglyphics,
We
should
come
up
right
between
his
legs.
When
those
damn
Yanks
go
to
sleep...
-
No
offense.
We'll
dig
our
way
up
and
steal
that
book
right
out
from
under
them?
Are
you
sure
Oh,
yes,
if
those
beastly
Americans
-
No
offense.
Where'd
our
smelly
Iittle
friend
get
to?
Hey.
What
have
we
here?
Blue
gold.
This
will
fetch
a
mighty
fine
price.


-
HENDERSON:
Let's
get
us
some
treasure!
Seti
was
no
fool.
I
think
perhaps
BURNS:
Oh,
I
think
we
should
listen
Yeah,
sure.
Let
them
open
it.

RICK:
Let
me
get
this
straight.
They
ripped
out
your
guts
They'd
take
out
your
heart
as
well.
I
don't
think
we
need
to
know
this.
They'd
take
a
sharp,
red-hot
poker,
scramble
things
asbout
a
bit,
-
That's
gotta
hurt.
-
You'll
be
dead
when
they
do
this.
if
I
don't
make
it
out
of
here,
Likewise.
Oh,
my
God.
It's
a...
It's
a
sarcophagus.
Buried
at
the
base
of
Anubis.
He
must
have
been
Or
he
did
something
very
naughty.
Oh,
Allah.
One
more.

One
more.



Help
me!
Help
me!
Help
me!


Well,
who
is
it?
"He
That
Shall
Not
Be
Named."

This
looks
like
some
sort
of
a
lock.
Well,
whoever's
in
here
RICK:
Yeah,
no
kidding.
It'd
take
us
a
month
A
key?
A
key!
A
key!
-
Who?
the
one
with
the
hook.
Hey,
that's
mine.


-
EVELYN:
What
do
you
suppose
killed
him?
Seems
that
our
American
friends
Three
of
their
diggers
were
melted.
-
What?
Salt
acid.
Pressurized
salt
acid.
Maybe
this
place
really
is
cursed.

Oh,
for
goodness'
sake,
you
two!
-
You
don't
believe
in
curses?
I
believe
if
I
can
see
it
and
I
can
touch
it,
I
believe
in
being
prepared.
Let's
see
what
our
friend

-
What?
A
broken
bottle.
Glenlivet,
12
years
old!
He
may
have
been
as
stinky
fellow,

Take
this.
Stay
here.
-
No,
wait,
wait!
Wait
for
me.
Wait!
Excuse
me,
Evy!
Mr.
Henderson!
Wake
up!

JONATHAN:
O'Connell!
ARDETH:
Enough!

We
will
shed
no
more
blood,
Leave
this
place
or
die.
You
have
one
day.

Evelyn.
Hey.
-
Are
you
all
right?
-
You
sure?
BURNS:
That
proves
it.
Old
Seti's
fortune's
For
them
to
protect
it
like
this,
No,
these
men
are
desert
people.
You
know,
maybe
just
at
night,
RICK:
Hey,
tough
stuff,
try
a
right
hook.
Ball
up
your
fist
and
put
it...
And
then
mean
it.
Hit
it
right
here.
-
Mean
it!
Okay,
it's
time
for
another
drink.
Unlike
my
brother,
sir,
I
know
when
to
say
no.
And
unlike
your
brother,
miss,
you,
I
just
don't
get.
I
know.
You're
wondering
what
is
a
place
like
me
doing
-
Yeah,
something
like
that.
You
see,
my
father
was
a
very,
very
famous
explorer.
And
he
loved
Egypt
so
much,
he
married
my
mother,
who
was
an
Egyptian
and
quite
an
adventurer
herself?
I
get
your
father
I
get
him,
but...
What
are
you
doing
here?
Look,
I
may
not
be
an
explorer
or
an
adventurer
or
a
treasure
seeker
or
a
gunfighter,
Mr.
O'Connell,
but
I
am
proud
of
what
I
am.
And
what
is
that?
I...
am
a
librarian.
And
I
am
going
to
kiss
you,
-
Mr.
O'Connell.
Rick.

-
There
is
a
curse
upon
this
chest.
-
Who
cares?
In
these
hallowed
grounds,
-
is
as
strong
today
as
it
was
then.
What's
it
say?

"Death
will
come
on
swift
wings"
"to
whomsoever
opens
this
chest."



BENI:
We
should
not
be
here.
This
is
not
good.
It
says,
"There
is
one,
the
undead,"
"who,
if
brought
back
to
life,
"to
consummate
this
curse."
Let's
make
sure
we
don't
bring
anyone
"He
will
kill
all
who
open
this
chest"
"and
assimilate
their
organs
and
fluids,"
"and
in
so
doing,
he
will
regenerate"
"and
no
longer
be
the
undead,"
"but
a
plague
upon
this
Earth."
HENDERSON:
Well,
we
didn't
come
-
DAVE:
That's
right.
It's
the
curse.
It's
the
curse!
Beware
of
the
curse!
Beware!
Stupid
superstitious
bastard.
Oh,
I've
dreamt
about
this
You
dream
about
dead
guys?
Look,
the
sacred
spells
This
man
must
have
been
condemned
-
Tough
break.
Now,
let's
see
who's
inside,
shall
we?


Oh,
my
God,
Is
he
supposed
to
look
like
that?
No,
I've
never
seen
He's
still...
Still...
-
Juicy.
Yes.
He
must
be
more
than
3,000
years
old,
and,
well,
it
looks
as
if
he's
still
decomposing.
Hey,
look
at
that.
-
What
do
you
make
of
this?
Fingernails.
This
man
was
buried
alive.
And
he
left
a
message.
"Death
is
only
the
beginning?"
Oh,
my
God.
It
does
exist.
-
The
Book
of
the
Dead.
Who
cares
about
a
book?
This,
gentlemen.
This
is
treasure.
Hell,
I
wouldn't
trade
you
for
a
brass...
Look
at
that.
EGYPTOLOGIST:
BURNS:
Now,
we're
on
to
something.

I
believe
you
need
a
key
to
open
that
book.
HENDERSON:
Say,
O'Connell,
what
do
you
think
We
hear
you
boys
found
yourselves
If
you
dry
that
fellow
out,
EVELYN:
Look
what
I
found.
You're
in
her
seat.
-
Now!
Scarab
skeletons,
flesh-eaters.
I
found
them
inside
our
friend's
coffin.
They
can
stay
alive
for
years
Unfortunately
for
our
friend,
he
was
RICK:
So
somebody
and
then
they
slowly
ate
him
alive?
Very
slowly.
He
certainly
wasn't
as
popular
fellow
Well,
he
probably
got
a
little
too
frisky
Well,
according
to
my
readings,
our
friend
suffered
the
Hom-Dai,
one
reserved
only
In
my
research,
I've
never
heard
of
-
RICK:
That
bad,
huh?
They
never
used
it
because
they
feared
it
so.
It's
written
that
if
a
victim
of
the
Hom-Dai
he
would
bring
with
him
That's
called
stealing,
you
know?
According
to
you
and
my
brother,
RICK:
I
thought
the
Book
of
Amun-Ra
It
is
made
out
of
gold.
This
is
something
else.
I
think
this
may
be
the
Book
of
the
Dead.
The
Book
of
the
Dead?
Are
you
sure
you're
meant
to
be
It's
just
a
book.
No
harm
ever
came
from
reading
a
book.

That
happens
a
lot
around
here.
So,
what's
it
say?
"Amun
Ra.
Amun
Dei."
It
speaks
of
the
night
and
of
the
day.


No!
You
must
not
read
from
the
book!


Run!
Go,
go!

What
have
we
done?
-
BURNS:
Where
the
hell
did
they
come
from?
BURNS:
My
glasses.
My
glasses!
Leave
me!
Leave
me!
Hey!
Hey!
Could
you
help
me
find
my
gl...
Wait
for
me!

Who's
there?
Who's
there?

BURNS:

Daniels?




Oh,
Jon!

Scarabs!
JONATHAN:
Run,
Evy!
Go,
go,
go!
Run!

-
Evelyn?
-
Evelyn?


Oh,
Mr.
Burns.
Thank
goodness.
I
was
just
starting
to
get
scared.
I've
lost
everyone.

My
eyes.
My
eyes...



Please
help
me.
My
tongue.
He
took
my
tongue.
Please
don't
leave
me.

Anck-Su-Namun.
Damn
it!
It's
a
trap
door.
There's
gotta
be
a
switch

-
Run,
you
sons
of
bitches!
Run!

Go!
Go!

Come
with
me
my
Princess
Anck-su-namum.
There
you
are!
Come
on.
Let's
get
out
of
here.

JONATHAN:
Evy!



-
Move!
BENI:
Did
you
see
that?
I
told
you
to
leave
or
die.
You
refused.
Now,
you
may
have
killed
us
all,
for
you
have
unleashed
a
creasture
-
Relax.
I
got
him.
He's
not
of
this
world.
-
You
bastard.
We
saved
him.
Saved
him
Leave,
all
of
you,
quickly,

I
must
now
go
on
the
hunt,
I
already
told
you,
I
got
him.
Know
this,
this
creature
is
the
bringer
of
death.
He
will
never
eat,
he
will
never
sleep,




May
the
good
Lord
protect
as
a
shepherd
watches
over
his
flock.

No.
Okay.



The
language
of
the
slaves...
I
may
have
use
for
you.
And
the
rewards...
...will
be
great.
My
prince.
Where
are
the
other
sacred
jars...


FORT
BRYDON
-
CAIRO

I
thought
you
said
you
didn't
believe
Having
an
encounter
with
a
3,000-year-old
does
tend
to
convert
one.
Forget
it.
We're
out
the
door,
-
Oh,
no,
we
are
not.
Oh,
no,
we
are
not.
We
woke
him
up,
We?
What
we?
We
didn't
read
that
book.
I
told
you
not
to
play
around
with
that
thing.
Yes,
right
then,
me,
me,
me,
me.
Yeah?
How?
You
heard
the
man.
Then
we
are
just
going
to
have
to
find
There
goes
that
we
again.
Look,
will
you
listen
to
me?
Once
this
creature
has
been
reborn,
until
the
whole
of
the
Earth
is
destroyed.
-
Yeah?
Is
that
my
problem?
Evelyn,
I
appreciate
but
when
I
signed
on,
I
agreed
to
take
you
I
have
done
that?
End
of
job.
End
of
story.
That's
all
I
am
to
you?
A
contract?
You
can
either
tag
along
with
me
or
you
can
-
What's
it
gonna
be?
-
Fine.
Fine.

I'm
the
last
of
the
Royal
Air
Corps
Some
bloody
idiot
spilt
his
drink.
All
the
other
laddies
died
in
the
sky
Good
chaps,
every
one
of
them,
too.
-
Hi,
Winston.
You
know,
O'Connell,
there
hasn't
been
a
single
challenge
Yeah?
We
all
got
I
just
wish
I
could
have
chucked
it
in
and
gone
down
in
flame
and
glory,
instead
of
sitting
around
here,
rotting
-
of
boredom
and
booze.
Cheers.
Oh,
well,
back
to
the
airfield.
-
Tell
me,
has
your
sister
always
been...
We're
all
packed
up,
but
the
damn
boat
Tail
set
firmly
between
your
legs,
I
see.
You
can
talk.
You
don't
have
So,
how's
your
friend?
He
had
his
eyes
and
his
tongue
ripped
out.
I'm
so
pleased
to
meet
you.
Prince
Imhotep
does
not
Iike
to
be
touched.
A
silly
Eastern
superstition,
I'm
afraid.
Please
forgive
me.
BENI:
Mr.
Burns,
Prince
Imhotep
No.
And
for
your
eyes,
-
and
for
your
tongue.
-
But
I
am
afraid
more
is
needed.
The
prince
must
finish
the
job
and
consummate
the
curse,
-
which
you
and
your
friends...
-
...have
brought
down
upon
yourselves.

Good
luck,
boys.
Sweet
Jesus!
Tasted
just
like...
Blood.
"And
the
rivers
and
waters
of
Egypt
He's
here.

MAN:
Oh,
looks
Iike
it's
gonna
storm.
-
Oh,
Evelyn!
We've
got
problems.

Hey!
Beni,
you
little
stinkweed.
Where
you
been?



We
are
in
serious
trouble.

You
saved
me
from
the
undead.
I
thank
you.


We
are
in
very
serious
trouble.
JONATHAN:
He
does
seem
to
like
you
Evy.
HENDERSON:
What's
this
guy
want?
There's
only
one
person
EVELYN:
You!
-
Gentlemen.
Do
you
really
want
to
know,
After
what
I
just
saw,
CURATOR:
We
are
part
For
over
3,000
yeasrs,
We
are
sworn
at
manhood
to
do
any
and
all
from
being
reborn
into
this
world.
Because
of
you,
we
have
failed.
You
think
this
justifies
the
killing
To
stop
this
creature?
Let
me
think.
-
Yes!
Question.
Why
doesn't
he
like
cats?
Cats
are
the
guardians
of
the
underworld.
He
will
fear
them
Then
he
will
fear
nothing.
You
know
how
he
gets
-
By
killing
everyone
who
opened
that
chest.
EVELYN:
Jonathan,
will
you
stop
When
I
saw
him
alive
at
Hamunaptra,
And
then
juat
now
in
Mr.
Burns'
quarters,
It's
because
of
his
love
for
Anck-Su-Namun
-
Apparently,
even
after
3,000
years...
Yes,
that
is
very
romantic,
Perhaps
he
will
once
again
Yes.
And
it
appears
he
has
already
chosen
Bad
luck,
old
mum.
CURATOR:
On
the
contrary,
it
may
just
give
us
the
time
we
need
We
will
need
all
the
help
we
can
get.
His
powers
are
growing.
JONATHAN:
"And
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
"and
there
was
darkness
EVELYN:
We
must
stop
him
Who
opened
that
chest?
HENDERSON:
There
was
me
-
And
Burns,
of
course.
What
about
my
buddy,
Beni?
No,
he
scrammed
out
of
there
-
Yeah,
he
was
the
smart
one.
We
must
find
the
Egyptologist
-
before
the
creature
can
get
to
him.
She
stays
here.
You
three,
come
with
me.
HENDERSON:
Not
me...
Just
a
minute!
You
can't
leave
me
behind
Who
put
you
in
charge,
O'Connell?
Jonathan!
O'Connell!
-
Sorry,
but
he's
a
bit
tall.
O'Connell,
you
are
not
leaving
me
in
here!
EVELYN:
Jonathan,
if
you
don't
-
EVELYN:
O'Connell...
-
Let
me
out
of
here.
-
and
no
one
goes
in,
right?
-
Right?
O'Connell!
Jonathan!
Let's
go,
Jonathan?
Oh,
I
thought
I
could
just
astay
at
the
fort
-
RICK:
Now!
We're
just
gonna
rescue
the
Egyptologist.





Well,
well,
well.
Let
me
guess.
JONATHAN:
Nice
shot.
Oh,
Beni,
did
you
fall
down?
You
came
back
from
the
desert
What
friend?
You
are
my
only
friend.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
with
this
creep?
It
is
better
to
be
the
right
hand
of
the
devil
As
long
as
I
serve
him,
I
am
immune.

Immune
from
what?

What
did
you
say?
I
don't
wanna
tell
you.
What
are
you
looking
for?
The
book!
The
black
book
they
found
at
Hamunaptra.
He
said
to
me
it
would
be
-
What
does
he
want
the
book
for?
Something
about
bringing
But
that's
all.
Just
the
book,
I
swear.
And
your
sister.
But
other
than
that...







-
That's
two
down,
two
to
go.
SOLDIER:

Guards
in
place!
Reporting
all
clear,
sir!
To
hell
with
this?
I'm
going
downstairs,
get
me
a
drink.
-
Yeah.
Yeah,
get
me
a
glass
of
bourbon.
-
And
a
shot
of
bourbon.
-
And
as
bourbon
chasser.
Don't
worry
about
the
door.





Anck-Su-Namun.

Hey,
get
your
ugly
face
off
of
her!

Look
what
I
got.



-
You
all
right?
Well,
according
to
legend,
the
black
book
is
supposed
to
bring
people
Until
now,
it
was
a
notion
Believe
it,
sister.
Yes.
I'm
thinking
that
if
the
black
book
-
Then
maybe
the
gold
book
can
kill
him.
Now,
we
just
have
to
find
out
CROWD:

Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
ALL:

Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Last
but
not
least,
ARDETH:
They
have
become
his
slaves.
So
it
has
begun,
the
beginning
of
the
end.
Not
quite
yet,
it
hasn't.
Come
on.
Imhotep.
CROWD:

Imhotep.
Imhotep.

Imhotep.
Imhotep.
According
to
Bembridge
scholars,
is
located
inside
the
statue
of
Anubis.
-
That's
where
we
found
the
black
book.
Looks
Iike
the
old
boys
They
mixed
the
books
up.
Mixed
up
where
they
were
buried.
So,
if
the
black
book
then
the
golden
book
must
be
inside...

-
Come
on,
Evy,
faster.
Not
right
now,
it
isn't.
-
I
think
I'll
go
and
get
the
car
started.
The
golden
Book
of
Amun-Ra
Take
that,
Bembridge
scholars.

Imhotep.
ALL:
lmhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Let's
go,
let's
go,
let's
go!
Get
this
thing
in
gear,
boy.

JONATHAN:
Evy.
Come
on,
Evy.
Hurry
up.
Imhotep!

You're
gonna
get
yours,
Beni!
You
hear
me?
-
You're
gonna
get
yours!


Hang
on!

Hey!
O'Connell!
O'Connell!




Jump

Move,

move!
ALL:

Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.

Imhotep.
It's
the

He's
fully
regenerated.

Come
with
me,
my
princess.
It
is
time
to
make
you
mine
forever.
For
all
eternity,
idiot.
BENI:
Take
my
hand,
Oh,
dear.
-
Have
you
got
any
bright
ideas?
You
better
think
of
something
fast,
you're
the
first
one
I'm
coming
after.
No.
-
Don't.
He
has
to
take
me
to
Hamunaptra
She
is
right.
I'll
be
seeing
you
again.
Evelyn!
-
Hey,
that's
mine.
Kill
them
all!
No!
Let
go
of
me!
ALL:

Goodbye,
my
friend.

Imhotep.
Come

What
about
my
sister?
Go!
RICK:
You're
next!
Come
on!
Give
me
your
hand!
-
You
go!
Go!



RICK:
Morning,
Winston.
A
word?
What's
your
little
problem
got
to
do
Not
a
damn
thing.
-
Is
it
dasngerous?
By
Jove,
do
you
really
think
so?
Everybody
else
we've
bumped
into
has
died.
What's
the...
What's
the
challenge,
then?
Rescue
the
damsel
in
distress,
Winston
Havlock
at
your
service,
sir.
Are
you
all
right?
Do
I
bloody
look
all
right?
How
you
doing?
See
that?
I've
never
seen
one
so
big.
-
Never?
Get
off
me!
Get

you,
darling?
