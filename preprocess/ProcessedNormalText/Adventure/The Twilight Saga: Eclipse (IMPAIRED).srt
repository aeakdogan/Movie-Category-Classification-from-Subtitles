You
know,
I've
got
an
English
final.
I
gotta

Marry
me.
No.
Marry
me.
Change
me.
Okay,
I
will
if
you
marry
me.
It's
called
a
compromise.
Let's
just
call
it
coercion.
It's
not
fair.
Marriage
is
just...
It's
a
piece
of
paper.
Where
I'm
from,
Well,
where
I
come
from,
at
my
age,
it's
the
way
one
says,
So,
you're
worried
You
know,
Well,
I
think
you'll
find
is
a
little
lower.
So
marry
me.
I
can't.
I
have
to
be
back
at
4:00.

That
kid
trying
to
brown-nose
me
now
He
has
a
name.
Okay.
You
understand
I
know,
I
put
you
through
hell.
Yes,
you
did.
But
I
have
other
reasons
for
grounding
you.
Like...
I
just
want
you
to
get
some
separation
Dad,
there's
nothing
you
can
say.
Edward
is
in
my
life.
Yeah,
I'm
gathering
that.
So,
all
right,
how
about
this?
I'll
make
you
a
deal.
You're
not
grounded
anymore
if
you
use
your
new-found
freedom
to
see
Like
Jacob.
He's
going
through
His
dad's
really
worried
about
him.
I

that

you.
You
needed

How
did
you...
Alice.
Hey,
did
you
do
this
to
my

Bella,
you
have
to
understand.
Your
safety
is
everything
to
me.
Jacob's
not

Not
intentionally,
Edward.
I
have
until
graduation
to
see
him.
And
then
I'll
be
one
of
you,
and
he'll
hate

forever.
Well,
I'm
sorry.

JESSICA:
No
way.
Stop.
Good.
Just
in

All

you

No,
this'll

I

So,
thank
you.
You
gotta
embrace
the

Jess.
They
are

And
that
is
why
you
are

Jess
doesn't

The

is
gonna
be

Epic?
It'll
change
lives.
I've
decided
to
throw
a
party.
After
all,
how
many
times
A
party?
At
your
place?
I've
never
seen
your
house.
No
one's
ever
seen
their
house.
Another
party,
Alice?
It'll
be
fun.
Yeah.
That's
what
you
said
last
time.
Hey,
Angela.
Do
you
need
some
help
with
those?
JESSICA:
be
sending
money
and
then
you'll
be
raking
it
in.
MIKE:
Wait
a
minute.
People
give
you
money?

I
know
you
know
what
she
saw.
Tell
me.
It
was
nothing.
You
looked
worried.
Just
that
everyone
noticed
I
think
that
ship
sailed
long
ago.
I
wonder
what's
wrong.
EDWARD:
Their
son
went
missing
in
Seattle
Charlie's
doing
what
he
can,
but...
You
know
something
about
this?
We've
been
tracking
the
situation
Unexplained

Killings.
If
the
situation
gets
any
more
conspicuous,
If
they
go
to
Seattle,
They
could
see
I'm
still
human.
It
won't
get
that
far.
But
we'll
go
to
Seattle
if
we
have
to.
CHARLIE:
I'll
fax
these
down,
first
thing.
Hey.
You
ready
for
dinner?
It
is
still
just
you
and
I,
right?
No,
I'm
just
dropping
her
off.
See
you
later.
Bye.
Bella,
my
parents
wanted
to
remind
you
you
got
for
your
birthday.
A
round
trip
ticket
to
see
Mom
in
Florida.
That
was
generous.
It
expires
soon,
Well,
I
can't
just
drop
everything
and
go.
It
might
be
your
last
chance
to
see
her
CHARLIE:
Might
not
be
a
bad
idea.
Get
out
of
town
for
a
couple
days.
Yeah,
I
wouldn't
mind
seeing
Mom.
As
long
as
you
use
the
companion
ticket.
Wait.
There's
two
tickets?
Super.
That
makes
me
really
happy.
BELLA:
I
did
want
to
see
my
mom.
I
wanted
to
know
RENEE:
Aren't
you
gonna
miss
this?
Can't
you
just
feel
the
vitamin
D
Yeah,
I
am
gonna
miss
this.
You
know,
colleges
in
Florida
I'm
just
saying,
I'm
never
gonna
see
you.
They
have
a
really
great
science
program.
You
mean,
Edward
program?
The
way
he
watches
you,
it's
like
he's
willing
to
leap
in
front
Is
that
a
bad
thing?
It's
an
intense
thing.
You're
different
with
him.
He
moves,
you
move.
Like
magnets.
I
don't
know,
we're
just...
RENEE:
In
love.
I
get
it.
I
just
want
to
make
sure
You
know,
'cause
you're
the
one
All
right,
enough
with
the
heavy.
Mom.
Congraduation.
I
didn't
want
you
I
didn't,
come
on.

Are
these
all
our
old
trip
T-shirts?
BELLA:
Get
out!
I
thought
they'd
make
a
good
quilt,
Remember
this
one?
Ensenada.
The
Snake
Pit.
But
this
one
is
my
favorite,
here.
The
three-headed
lobster
from
Maine.
This
is
amazing.
I
just
figured,
you
know,
have
kids,
we
can
add
to
it.
Maybe
go
visit
the
world's
largest
Thanks.
I'm
glad
you
like
it.
Just
thought
you
should
have
Mom...
I
miss
you.
Honey,
I
miss
you,
too.
Are
you
sure
this
is
where
you
saw
her?
She's
almost
here.
On
your
left!

Wait!
She's
in
their
territory.
She'll
get
away!
No,
she
won't!
ESME:
Emmett,
no!


Do
you
regret
going?
No.
It
was
really
great
seeing
my
mom.
Just
really
hard
saying
goodbye.
It
doesn't
have
to
be
goodbye.
Is
that
why
you
asked
me
to
go?
You
thought
I
was
gonna
change
my
mind?
I'm
always
hoping
for
that.
What?
If
I
asked
you
to
stay
Of
course
not.
Hey.
Charlie
said
you
left
town.
Yeah.
To
visit
my
mom.
Why?
He's
checking
to
see
if
you're
still
human.
Look,
I'm
here
to
warn
you.
If
your
kind
come
on
our
land
again...
Wait,
what?
You
didn't
tell
her?
Just
leave
it
alone,
Jacob.
Tell
me
what?
Emmett
and
Paul
had
a
misunderstanding.
It's
nothing
to
worry
about.
JACOB:
Listen
to
you.
Did
you
lie
to
get
her
out
of
town,
too?
You
should
just
leave.
Now.
She
has
a
right
to
know.
She
is
the
one
the
redhead
wants.
Victoria?
Alice's
vision.
I
was
trying
to
protect
you.
By
lying
to
me.
Okay,
we're
gonna
talk
about
this,
but...
You.
Why
haven't
you
called
me
back?
I
had
nothing
to
say.
Well,
I
have
tons.
Hold
on.
Bella.
Edward,
you
have
to
trust
me.
I
do
trust
you.
It's
him
I
don't
trust.
Hey,
lose
the
grin,
Jacob.
Hold
on
tight.

isn't

I

Same
here.
Sam,
we

We're

She

So
when
did

Around
when

I

it

It's
more
than

Bella.
Sam
imprinted
on

Do
I
even
want
to
know
what
that
is?
Imprinting
on
someone
is
like...
Like
when
you

her,
everything
changes.
All
of

It's
her.
Nothing

You
would

Have
you

for

you're

you're

You

this
was

Not

I

not
before
you've...
Or
before
I
could...

For
a
second,
just
a
second,
I
thought...
But
he's
got
his
hooks
in
you
so
deep...
I
decided
this,
not
him.
Bella,
they're
not
even
alive.
It
makes
me
sick.
Better
you
really
be
dead
than
one
of
them.
I
can't
believe
you
said
that.
Edward
was
right,
I
shouldn't

Bella,
come

Please.
I'm

we're

No,
you're

I'm
tired
of
this.
BELLA:
Edward
hated
the
idea,
but
it
wasn't
about
rivalry
anymore.
It
was
about
my
safety,
and
Charlie's.
In
the
days
that
followed,
I
got
them

wolves

wasn't

Maybe
rush
a
little
bit.
Hey,
beautiful.

So,
what
do
you
wanna
do
today?
Bike,
hike,
just
hang?
Your
call.
But
we're
going
to
a
party
tonight.
Are
you
sure
this
is
okay?
I
really
hate
being
a
party
crasher.
Technically,
You
see?

council
leaders,
She
took
over
for
Harry
when
he
died.
Okay,
I
should
not
be
here.
You're
okay.
I
thought...
I
mean,
they
thought
it
would
The
histories?
The
tribe's
histories?
Aren't
they
secret?
We
all
got
a
role
to
play,
I
mean,
it's
the
first
time
But
you
are
the
first
outsider.
Ever.
If
I
had
known
that,
I
would
have,
like...
I
don't
know,
dressed
better.
Hey.
Paul's
been
hoovering
the
grub,
Good
looking
out,
bro.
Bella,
this
is
Seth
Clearwater,
Hi.
Newest.
Bestest.
Brightest.
And
slowest.
Come
on,
your
dad's
about
to
start.
The
Quileutes
have
been
a
small
tribe
but
we
have
always
had
magic
in
our
blood.
We
were
great
spirit
warriors,
shape-shifters
that
transformed
This
enabled
us
to
scare
off
our
enemies
and
protect
our
tribe.
One
day,
It
looked
like
a
man,
but
it
was
hard
like
stone
and
cold
as
ice.


Our
warriors'
sharp
teeth
but
only
fire
would
completely
destroy
it.
They
lived
in
fear
And
they
were
right.


She
took
her
vengeance
out
on
the
village.
Our
elder
chief,
Taha
Aki,
was
the
only
spirit
warrior
left


Taha
Aki's
third
wife
The
third
wife
was
no
magical
being,
with
no
special
powers
but
one,
courage.

The
third
wife's
sacrifice
long
enough
for
Taha
Aki
to
destroy
her.
She
saved
the
tribe.
Over
time,
our
enemies
have
disappeared.
But
one
remains,
the
cold
ones.
Our
magic
awakens
when
they're
near,
and
we
sense
it
now.
We
feel
the
threat
in
our
blood.
Something
terrible
is
coming,
and
we
must
all
be
ready,
all
of
us.



What
did
you
do
to
me?
I'm
so...
Yeah.
I
know.
We'll
find
you
someone
to
drink.
MALE
VAMPIRE:
Mine!
Just
try
not
to
get
killed,
will
you?
I'm
gonna
need
numbers.
Seattle
is
in
a
state
of
terror.
Police
are
baffled
by
Theories
range
from
a
vicious
new
gang
Reporting
live...
It's
getting
worse.
It
takes
more
than
one
of
our
kind
Quite
a
few
more.
It's
newborns.
What,
like
new
vampires?
In
the
first
few
months
after
the
change.
That's
when
Insane
with
thirst.
Something
to
look
forward
to.
No
one's
trained
these
newborns,
Someone's
creating
an
army.
Well,
now
we're
definitely
An
army
of
vampires?
And
they've
been
created
to
fight
someone.
We're
the
only
clan
even
close
to
Seattle.
DR.
CULLEN:
Regardless
of
why
if
we
don't
put
a
stop
to
them,
I'm
surprised
they've
Maybe
they're
behind
it.
In
Italy,
I
read
Aro's
mind.
He
wants
me
and
Alice
to
join
him,
but
he
knows
we'll
never
choose
him
An
army
could
solve
that
for
him.
Hey.
Did
you
eat
dinner
yet?
No,
I
haven't.

This
kid,
Riley
Biers,
and
his
poor
parents
have
been
papering
You
think
they
should
just
give
up?
Well,
I
wouldn't
if
it
were
you.
Not
ever.
BELLA:
I
have
to
figure
out
Why
I
won't
be
home
for
Christmases,
and
why
I
won't
visit,
why
they'll
never
see
me
again.
After
a
few
decades,
Problem
solved.
Why
are
you
so
against
I've
told
you.
Be
honest
with
me.
There's
more.
I
know
the
consequences
I've
lived
through
it.
And
to
let
you
suffer
that...
You
believe
I
have
a
soul,
and
I
don't.
But
to
risk
yours,
just
for
the
sake
of
that's
the
most
selfish
thing
I'll
ever
do.
I
thought
that
you
were
afraid
You
know,
like,
I
wouldn't
be
warm,
You'll
always
be
my
Bella.
My
Bella,
just
less
fragile.
BELLA:
Gosh,
it's
so
pretty
here.
So,
Alice
has
planned
Which
you're
invited
to.
Yeah,
I
figured
that.
What?
I
just
wanted
to
do
this
differently.
Smoother.
But
now
I'm
out
of
time.
Do
what?
You
need
to
hear
the
truth,
Bella,
understand
all
your
options.
And
you
need
to
know
that
I'm
in
love
with
you,
and
I
want
you
to
choose
me
I
thought
you
understood.
I
don't
feel
that
way
for
you.
What
don't
you
buy?
That's
how
I
feel.
You
feel
something
else
for
me.
So
I'm
not
giving
up.
I'm
gonna
fight
for
you
until
your
heart
stops
beating.
Well,
then
you're
not
gonna
You're
rushing
into
it
because
No,
I'm
not.
I
know
what
I
want.
You
wouldn't
have
to
change
for
me,
Bella,
or
say
goodbye
to
anybody.
I
can
give
you
more
than
him.
I
mean,
he
probably
can't
even
kiss
you
Feel
that?
Flesh
and
blood.
And
warmth.

God!
God!
Edward!
If
you
ever
touch
her
Don't
do
this
here!
Don't
do
this
here!
Wait
for
her
to
say
the
words.
Fine!
And
she
will.
Jacob,
just
go,
okay?
CHARLIE:
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Easy,
guys.
Easy.
Let's
take
it
down
a
notch.
All
right?
What's
going
on?
I
kissed
Bella.
And
she
broke
her
hand.
Punching
my
face.
Total
misunderstanding.
DR.
CULLEN:
It's
just
a
sprain.
It
should
heal
fairly
quickly.
Trying
to
walk
and
chew
gum
I
punched
a
werewolf
in
the
face.
Bad
ass.
Tough
enough
to
take
you
on.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Got
any
leads?
No
sign
of
the
intruder.
But
Victoria
Go
blather
to
someone
else
Okay...
Rosalie,
I
don't
understand
what
I
did
Hate...
I
don't
hate
you.
I
don't
particularly
like
you,
but...
Bella,
I
envy
you.
What?
That's
ridiculous.
You
have
a
choice.
I
didn't.
None
of
us
did.
I
don't
care
My
life
is
not
miserable.
I
mean,
it's
not
perfect.
Mine
was.
Absolutely
perfect.
There
were
things
I
still
wanted,
to
be
married,
with
a
nice
house
and
a
husband
to
kiss
me
a
family
of
my
own.
Royce
King
was
the
most
eligible
bachelor
I
barely
knew
him.
But
I
was
young.
On
the
last
night
of
my
life,
I
wasn't
far
from
home.
There
she
is.
Hey,
Rose!
Come
over
here!
Here.
Hold
this.
Hey,
come
over
here.
We've
been
waiting
for
you.
There
she
is.
Royce.
Royce!

You're
drunk.
Isn't
she
lovely,
John?
It's
hard
to
say
with
all
those
clothes
on.
What
do
you
say,
Rose?
Why
don't
we
take
off
a
few
layers?
Stop.
Stop!
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.
Sober.
Hey,
where
do
you
think
you're
going?
I
said,
get...
Come
back...
Hey!
You'll
do
as
I
say!
Stop!
Let
go!
Stop!
They
left
me
in
the
street,
Believe
me,
I
wanted
to
be.
Carlisle
found
me.
He
Thought
he
was
helping
me.
I
got
my
revenge
on
them.
One
at
a
time.
Saved
Royce
for
last,


I
was
a
little
theatrical
back
then.
Things
got
better
after
I
found
Emmett.
But
we'll
always
be
this.
Frozen.
Never
moving
forward.
That's
what
I
miss
the
most.
Possibilities.
Sitting
on
a
front
porch
somewhere,
Emmett,
gray-haired,
by
my
side,
surrounded
by
our
grandchildren.
Their
laughter.
I
understand
that
that's
what
you
want.
But
there's
nothing
than
Edward.
You're
wrong
again.
After
you've
been
changed,
one
thing
you'll
kill
for.
Blood.

What
did
I
say
about
a
low
profile?

Something's
coming.
Something
bigger
than
any
of
us
alone.
And
if
you
can't
control
yourselves,
we're
all
going
to
die.
What's
done
is
done,
just
clean
up
after
yourselves.
They've
already
drawn
too
much
attention.
So
has
our
inaction.
Others
may
begin
to
question
Let
them.
Maybe
we
should
consult
with
Aro.

Aro's
decisions
are
being
watched.
We
must
decide.
Then
decide,
sister.
It's
time.
Yes,
it
is.
Either
we
let
them
do
or
we
end
them.
Decisions,
decisions.
When
we
were
five,
they
asked
us
Our
answers
were
things
or,
in
my
case,
a
princess.
When
we
were
10,
they
asked
again.
We
answered
rock
star,
cowboy
But
now
that
we've
grown
up,
Well,
how
about
this?
Who
the
hell
knows?

Yeah!
This
isn't
the
time
to
make
This
is
the
time
to
make
mistakes.
Take
the
wrong
train
Fall
in
love
a
lot.
Major
in
philosophy,
because
there's
Change
your
mind,
and
change
it
again,
So
make
as
many
mistakes
as
you
can.
That
way,
someday,
we
won't
have
to
guess.
We'll
know.

Good.
I'm
glad.
Hey.
How
do
you
know
so
much
about
this?
I
didn't
have
quite
the
same
upbringing
Those
bites
are
like
mine.
All
the
training
was
useless
against
the
newborns.
Still,
I
never
lost
a
fight.
This
happened
during
the
Civil
War?
I
was
the
youngest
major
all
without
having
seen
any
real
battle.
Until?
Till
I
met
a
certain
immortal.
Maria.
I
was
riding
back
to
Galveston
after
evacuating
a
column
when
I
saw
them.
I
immediately
offered
them
my
aid.
Lovely.
And
an
officer.

You'd
better
do
it,
Maria.
What's
your
name,
soldier?
I
hope
you
survive.
You
may
be
of
great
use
to
me.
Maria
was
creating
an
army?
There
were
constant
brutal
battles
Maria
won
them
all.
She
was
smart,
careful,
and
she
had
me.

I
was
her
second
in
command.
My
ability
to
control
emotions
I
trained
her
newborns,

an
endless
occupation
since
she
never
It
was
my
job
to
dispose
of
them.
I
could
feel
everything
they
felt.

I
thought
what
Maria
and
I
had
was
love.
But
I
was
her
puppet.
I
didn't
know
there
was
another
way
till
I
found
Alice.
Now,
she'd
seen
me
coming,
of
course.
You
kept
me
waiting
long
enough.
My
apologies,
ma'am.
I
don't
know
what
I'd
have
become

You
never
have
to
be
that
again.

Jasper.
I
want
you
to
do
something
for
me.
Kill
her.

What
is
it?
The
intruder,
the
newborn
army,
they're
all
her
puppets.
Victoria.
Alice
would
have
seen
Unless
she's
hiding
behind
them

army.

I'm
not
just
gonna
hide

ask
me

don't
you
care
about
my
safety?
Of
course,
I
care.

you'd
say
no.

Sam
be

male,

Emily
and

wouldn't

again

older.
Much
older.

seemed
to
work
out
fine
for

later

school.

school.

What's
that?

my

a
virgin.
Okay!
Good.
Glad

covered
that.

Edward
a
little
bit
more
now.
What
are
you
doing
outside?
Nothing.

seems
only
fair
It's
really
pretty.
Thanks.
There's
a
bed.
I
thought
you
might
need
one
to
sleep
in.
I
think
an
air
mattress
Is
this
too
much?
No,
it's
perfect.
I
wanna
ask
you
something.
Okay,
marriage
is
the
condition
for
you
Yes.
Okay.
I
wanna
negotiate
my
own
condition.
Anything
you
want.
It's
yours.
You
promise?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
Bella.
No.
But
you
said
that
you
wanted
me
Not
ones
that
will
risk
killing
you.
And
everyone
says
once
I'm
changed
all
That
part
doesn't
last
forever.
While
I'm
still
me.
It's
too
dangerous.

go
to
some
ridiculously
expensive
I'll
marry
you.

you
how
it
works.
Don't
underestimate
them,
Riley.
but
they'll
be
able
According
to
your
friend?
My
dead
friend.
Laurent
found
out
about
the
things
and
they
killed
him.
But
not
before
he
told
me.
Maybe
he
was
wrong.
I
mean,
this
is
supposed
to
be
We've
been
tearing
it
up
You
don't
trust
me.
With
my
life.
I'm
just
saying...
So
that
we
can
feed
I
can't
live
in
fear
anymore,
I
won't
let
them.
I
am
going
to
end
the
Cullen
clan.
I
swear.
I
love
you
so
much.
You're
going
overboard.
If
this
is
all
I
can
contribute,
The
new
borns'll
be
frantic.
It's
okay.
It
doesn't
bother
me
anymore.
Since
when?
Since
I
spent
24
hours
You're
not
wearing
your
ring.
Well,
I
didn't
want
to
risk
losing
it.
Or
risk
Jacob
seeing
it.
I
think
we
should
wait
to
tell
him.
If
you're
having
second
thoughts...
I
just
want
him
to
have
a
clear
head.
Nobody's
I
hope.
Alice
says
there's
a
storm
coming.
We
should
get
going.
I'll
see
you
in
a
couple
of
hours.
Something
up?
Bunch
of
vampires
trying
to
kill
me.
Thank
you.
You
should
get
back
No,
I'm
staying.
You'll
need
my
connection
to
the
pack
You're
not
gonna
fight?
He's
not
happy
about
missing
the
action
Let's
get
you
inside.

I
should
have
chosen
a
site
lower
down.
What
can
I
do?

I
can't
sleep
Forget
it.
And
let's
face
it,
I
am
hotter
than
you.
Get
your
hand
off
me.
Don't
fight.
If
she
gets
sick,
it's
on
you.
Wow,
you're
freezing,
Bella.
Relax.
You'll
warm
up
soon.
Faster
if
you
took
your
clothes
off.
Jake.
Can
you
at
least
attempt
I
really
get
under
What?
Are
you
doubting
her
feelings
for
you?
Nice.
So
picking
through
my
brain's
okay,
Look.
I
know
she's
in
love
with
you.
But
she's
in
love
with
me,
too.
She
just
won't
admit
it
to
herself.
I
can't
tell
if
you're
right.
Then
let
me
ask
you
something.
If
she
chooses
me...
If
she
did,
would
you
try
to
kill
me?
That's
an
intriguing
idea.
But,
no.
I
couldn't
hurt
her
like
that.
So
you'd
just
turn
her
into
I
don't
want
that.
I
never
wanted
that.
So
stop
her.
I
left.
If
you'd
stayed
away
another
6
months,
Trust
me.
You
have
to
consider
that
I
might
I
have
considered
that.
I
know
you
can
protect
her.
But
you
can
give
her
a
life,
a
human
life.
But
I'm
not...
I'm
not
going
to
force
her
into
anything
The
last
time
I
tried,
Yeah.
That
I
remember.
When
you
thought
she
was
gone,
that
you'd
lost
her,
how
did
you
cope?
There
are
no
words.
But
I
wouldn't
wish
it
on
anyone,
Jacob.
This
might
sound
odd,
Meaning,
"As
much
as
I'd
love
to
kill
you,
If
we
weren't
natural
enemies
and
you
weren't
trying
to
I
might
actually
like
you.
Well,
if
you
weren't
planning
on
sucking
the
life
I
might...
No.
Not
even
then.
But
she
could
still
change
her
mind,
Then
I'd
let
her
go.
Right.
Hey,
Seth.
Where's
Jacob?
Did
he
already...
He's
checking
to
see
if
the
woods
are
clear
I'm
really
sorry
about
last
night.
It
definitely
won't
make
my
list
You
have
a
list?
Number
one
is
when
you
said
This
is
the
21st
century.
You're
marrying
him?
You
knew
he
was
listening!
Jake,
stop!
Don't!
Jake,
stop!
BELLA:
Jake,
please!
What
can
I
do?
You
can't
do
anything.
I
can,
No!
You're
not
thinking
clearly!
Maybe
I'll
get
myself
killed
No!
Just,
Jake,
stay.
Why?
Give
me
one
good
reason.
Because
I
don't
wanna
lose
you.
It's
not
good
enough.
Because
you're
too
important.
Still
not
good
enough.
Kiss
me.
I'm
asking
you
to
kiss
me.
That
should
have
been
our
first
kiss.
I
gotta
go.
I'll
be
back.
You
saw.
Jacob's
thoughts
are
pretty
loud.
I
don't
know
what
happened.
You
love
him.
I
love
you
more.
I
know.


It's
starting.



Jacob
just
got
there.
He's
good.


Someone's
hurt?
She's
close.
I
can
hear
her
thoughts.
Seth,
go.
She
knew
we
weren't
there,
She
knew
you'd
be
with
me.
She
found
us.
She's
not
alone.
Riley,
listen
to
me.
Victoria's
just
using
you
to
distract
me.
She
knows
I'll
kill
you.
In
fact,
she'll
be
glad
Don't
listen,
Riley.
I
can
read
her
mind.
VICTORIA:
He's
lying.
She
only
created
you
and
this
army
That's
the
only
thing
she
cares
about.
There's
only
you.
You
know
that.
Think
about
it.
You're
from
Forks.
You
know
the
area.
That's
the
only
reason
she
chose
you.
She
doesn't
love
you.
Riley.
Don't
let
him
do
this
to
us.
You
know
I
love
you.
You're
dead.


You
won't
get
another
chance
You
want
her.
You
want
me
to
feel
the
pain
you
felt
when
I
tore
him
to
pieces,
when
I
turned
him
into
ash,
when
I
turned
him
into
nothing.





Victoria!
Victoria!
Victoria!


Something
is
wrong.
Now.
EDWARD:
How
long?
DR.
CULLEN:
The
pack
needs
to
leave.
The
Volturi
won't
honor

Leah,
don't!
Jacob!
Jacob.
Hold
on.
The
bones
on
the
right
half
of
his
body
Bella.
Jacob,
you
idiot,
I
had
it!
I
need
to
set
the
bones
It's
already
starting.
We're
not
gonna
win
a
fight
We'll
take
him
back
to
Billy's.
Hang
in
there,
Jake.

It's
okay.
We
got
you.
They're
coming.
Impressive.
JANE:
I've
never
seen
a
coven
escape
We
were
lucky.
I
doubt
that.
It
appears
we
missed
JANE:
Yes.
It's
not
often
we're
rendered
unnecessary.
If
you'd
arrived
a
half
hour
ago,
Pity.
You
missed
one.
We
offered
her
asylum
That
wasn't
yours
to
offer.
Why
did
you
come?

Who
created
you?

You
don't
need
to
do
that.
I
know.
I
don't
know!
Riley
wouldn't
tell
us.
He
said
our
thoughts
weren't
safe.
Her
name
was
Victoria.
DR.
CULLEN:
Edward,
they
would
have
stopped
her.
Isn't
that
right,
Jane?
Of
course.
Felix.
She
didn't
know
what
she
was
doing.
We'll
take
responsibility
for
her.
Give
her
a
chance.
The
Volturi
don't
give
second
chances.
Caius
will
be
interested
to
know
The
date
is
set.
Take
care
of
that,
Felix.

Hey.
It's
been
going
on
for
a
while.
Why
did
he
have
to
butt
in?
Give
it
a
rest,
Leah.
The
worst
is
over.
He'll
be
all
right.
I
gave
him
some
morphine,
but
his
body
temperature
I'll
come
back
to
set
up
a
drip.
Thank
you.
He's
asking
for
you.
Hey,
Jake.
Hey.
I
was
worried
about
you.
Yeah.
I
guessed
Edward
would
read
my
thoughts.
Was
he
hard
on
you?
Or
you.
Well,
damn.
He's
better
than
I
thought.
Right.
Bella.
He's
not
as
perfect
as
you
think.
I
know
who
he
is.
Can
we
just
not
talk
about
that?
I'd
rather
get
all
the
re-breaking
done
Well,
at
least
I
know
It
wasn't
easy
making
you
admit
I
only
fought
them
because
I
knew
I'm
exactly
right
for
you,
Bella.
It
would
be
as
easy
as
breathing,
with
me.
You
know
I
love
you.
You
know
how
much
I
wish
it
was
enough.
Should
I
come
back?
I
need
some
time.
But
I'll
always
be
waiting.
Until
my
heart
stops
beating.
Maybe
even
then.
August
13th?
I
don't
need
to
be
Alice
said
she
could
get
the
wedding
I'm
sure
she
can.
There's
no
rush.
I've
chosen
my
life.
I
want
And
so
you're
gonna
let
Alice
The
dress,
the
reception,
the
guest
list.
I
mean,
who
knows
who
Does
it
matter?
I
just
don't
know
why
What?
The
wedding?
You're
trying
to
make
but
you're
already
giving
You're
wrong.
This
wasn't
a
choice
It
was
between
who
I
should
be
I've
always
felt
out
of
step,
I've
never
felt
normal.
Because
I'm
not
normal.
I
don't
want
to
be.
I've
had
to
face
death
in
your
world,
and
more
real,
more
myself.
Because
it's
my
world,
too.
It's
where
I
belong.
So
it's
not
just
about
me?
No.
Sorry.
I've
made
a
mess
trying
to
figure
And
I
wanna
tie
myself
to
you
Starting
with
a
wedding.
Actually,
something
a
little
more
difficult
first.
We
have
to
tell
Charlie.
It's
highly
dangerous.
It's
a
good
thing
you're
bulletproof.
I'm
gonna
need
that
ring.
