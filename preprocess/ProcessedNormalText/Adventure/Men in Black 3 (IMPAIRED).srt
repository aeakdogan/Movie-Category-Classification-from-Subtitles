You're
just
in
time!
Unless
this
is
the
one
where
Robinson
Whoo!
Are
we
missing
something?
The
game.
["11

J:

So
this
is
how
you
see
things?
It's
a
gigantic
pain
in
the
ass.
This
game
doesn't
happen
It's
always
October
and
November
and
March.
So
many
futures,
and
all
real.
Until
then,
they're
all
happening.
Like
this
one,
it's
my
favourite
moment
All
the
things
that
had
to
converge
They
were
in
last
place
every
single
You
said
you
had
a
gift.
That
baseball,
thrown
for
the
last
out
of
game
five,
of
Chicopee,
Massachusetts,
due
to
the
horsehide
because
the
tanner's
wife
for
a
Puerto
Rican
golf
pro...
Um,
the
gift?
Oh,
yes,
of
course.
Uh,
it's
the
surprise.
It's
a
shield.

J:
Archanan.
Arc
Net.
How?
Davey
Johnson,
vvho
became
a
player
because
his
dad
couldn't
find
a

hits
his
bat

micrometers
popping
out
to
Cleon
Jones
who
would've
been
born
Clara,
typist,
if
his
parents
didn't
have
before
going
to
bed

A
miracle
is
what
seems
impossible
I
lost
my
planet.
I
don't
want
you
to
lose
yours.
It'll
lake
a
miracle,
you'll
be
my
new
in
human
history.
Oh,
dear.
I
forgot
to
see
this
one
coming.

Damn
it!


Have
these
in
the
future?
No.
Get
on.
Keep
gyro
settings
Balance
pitch
and
yaw
between
80
and
100
psi.
J:
Any
of
that!
Gyro
at
zero
gain.
Pitch
and
yaw
with
short
bursts
I
did.
Between
80
and
100
psi.
Got
it.
Whoa!
BORIS:
GRIFFIN:
All
right
there,
chief?
It'd
be
better
with
four
wheels!
Two
is,
like,
my
minimum.


K:
What
happens
if
Boris
J:
Boglodite
invasion,
total



The
box!


Good
boy.
We
gotta
stop
this
guy!
J:
You
haven't
been
trying?
K:
In
the
future,
Yes,
sir!


Did
you
get
him?
Give
me
a
sec.
Is
he
dead?
Negative.
He
got
away.
I
got
Griffin.
Let's
get
out
of
here.

[THUNDER
CRASHING
I
feel
younger
already.




You
pathetic
waste
I'd
kill
you
right
now,
Who
are
you?
Every
mistake
I've
ever
made,
What
happened
to
my
arm?
You
lose
it,
shot
off
by
a
human.
No
human
could
defeat
me.
You
spend
the
next
40
years
in
No
prison
can
hold
me!
They
built
one
especially
for
us,
No
human
has
been
to
the
moon,
so
they
cannot
have
Stop
arguing!
You
can
avoid
You
were
defeated!
That
wasn't
me,
that
was
you!

What's
your
plan?
Prevent
the
Arc
Net
Kill
anyone
who
tries
Good
plan.
Didn't
work.
With
my
help.
We'll
get
the
Arc
Net,
the
invasion
will
be
successful
and
we'll
get
to
keep
both
of
our
ar...!
Argh!
Stop
sharing
at
it!
Listen.

You
all
right?
It's
what
we
do.
You
still
have
the
Arc
Net?
When
you're
being
hunted
you
get
good
at
hiding
things.

J:

This
will
save
your
world.
Once
it's
outside
the
atmosphere,
a
whole
lot
bigger.
All
you
have
to
do
is
deploy
it.
You
mean
in
space?
Ah,
it's
just
one
small
step.
The
moon
launch.
Cape
Canaveral.
July
16th,
1969.
We
got
six
hours
to
get
to
Florida.
Better
get
a
move
on,
slick.
Uh,
wait,
uh,
hold
up.
Not
us.
He
has
to
be
the...
Griffin.
Shh-shh-shh.
What
do
you
mean,
alone?
I'm
gonna
go
to
Florida.
I
need
you
to
trust
me.
Trust
you?
I
don't
think
so.
You're
not
going
to
Florida.
That
ain't
gonna
happen,
partner.
Look,
K.
Please,
I
will
not
allow
you
Stop
me.
You
die
there!
Cape
Canaveral.
Apollo
launch.
Boris
kills
you
there.
That's
what
I'm
here
for.
That's
what
I
came
back
to
stop.
Oh,
dear.
We're
in
this
one.
K...
I
saw
the
file,
I
said
I
told
you
everything...

That's
for
lying
to
me.
Look,
I'm
sorry,
man!
Aah!
That's
for
telling
me
the
truth!
I'm
trying
to
protect
you.
Man!
Aah!
The
bitterest
truth
is
better
Shh-shh!
He
has
to
go
to
Cape
Canaveral.
He
must
deploy
the
Arc
Net
There's
no
other
way.
K
is
the
only
hope
Can
I
save
him?
Is
there
any
future
Yes.
But
where
there
is
death
there
will
always
be
death.

According
to
you,
So
we
know
it's
possible.
If
you're
half
the
agent
you'll
make
sure
So
are
we
partners?
You
tell
me.
Let's
go.

O:
how
are
you?
Okay,

hug
on
the
way
MAN:
This
morning,
man
is
about
with
the
expectation
Look,
I
gotta
ask
you.
If
we
pull
this
off,
O
and
I,
are
we...?
A
wise
man
once
told
me,
don't
ask
questions
you
don't
I
said
that,
didn't
I?

O:
J:
What
are
they?
Jetpacks?

No,
no,
no.
There's
a
reason
we
don't
K,
we
gotta
drive.
Can't
drive
to
Florida
from
Manhattan
Yeah,
we
can.
The
red
button,
Press
the
red
button,
No
red
buttons
yet,
slick.
Come
on,
man.
Do
you
know
how
to
work
this
stupid
thing?
It's
like
with
anything.
Just
have
to
strap
yourself
in,
Isn't
that
right,
Miss
O?
Unfortunately,
it
is.

You
ready,
slick?
Let's
get
it.
This
is
gonna
be
interesting!

[MAN
SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY
I'm
so
glad
this
isn't
One
of
the
times?
Oh,
we
got
company...
The
hell?

Is
that
a
battery
belt?

All
right,
I
got
it.

No,
any
reality
is
one
where
you
tell
the
truth.
The
truth?
The
truth
is
the
only
path.
This
is
a
restricted
areal.
Yes,
sir,
it
is.
Good
day,
gentlemen.
My
name
is
Agent
J.
We're

Griff
gave
us

That
worked.
Like
a
charm.
Three
trespassers.
No
IDs,
Some
kind
I've
never
seen
before.

What
breed
of
fool
to
penetrate
my
site
attempted
by
mankind?
Watched
by
God,
the
population
firstborn
Colonel,
they
had
these.
They
said
they
needed
for
an
invasion.
Thanks.
I
got
10
minutes
to
launch.
If
you
pose
a
threat
to
that
rocket,
I
told
the
truth
last
time.
Sir,
this
man
came
here
from
the
future
to
protect
me
so
I
can
attach
a
shield
to
the
top
I
need
your
help
to
do
that.
Take
them
to
the
brig.
You're
slipping,
Griff.
Sir,
if
I
may.

Corporal.
You
men
are
no
longer
needed.
I'll
take
the
prisoners.
Sir,
are
you-?
Follow
me.
You
did
the
future
thing.
Only
what
he
needed
to
see.
I
have
to
go
now.
What?
No,
no,
no.
Come
on.
You
don't
need
me
any
more.
All
right,
Griff,
When
Boris'
arm
is
taken,
the
past
He
will
not
know
All
right.
Arm
gone,
got
it.
When
that
happens,
go
home.
You
coming?
Yeah,
all
right!
Uh,
thanks,

Anything's
possible.
Oh,

part.

rocket
Questions?
Some
job
you
got

Griff
How
