KRISTOFF:
Come
on,
Sven.
Elsa.
Psst!
Elsa!

Wake
up.
Wake
up.
Anna,
go
back
to
sleep.

I
just
can't.
The
sky
is
awake,
so
I'm
awake.
So,
we
have
to
play.
Go
play
by
yourself.



Do
you
want
to
build
a
snowman?
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on!

ANNA:
Do
the
magic!
Do
the
magic!
Oh...
Ready?
This
is
amazing!

Watch
this!

Hi,
I'm
Olaf,
and
I
like
warm
hugs.
I
love
you,
Olaf!

ANNA:
Olaf...
Tickle
bumps!
Oh!
Hang
on!
Catch
me!
Gotcha!
Again!
Wait!
Whoo-hoo!

Whoo!
Anna!

Anna!

Mama!
Papa!

No,
no...
You're
okay,
Anna.

This
is
getting
out
of
hand.
It
was
an
accident.
Oh.
She's
ice
cold.


Ice?
Faster,
Sven.

Sven!

Please!
Help!

It's
the
king.

Trolls?
I'm
trying
to
listen.
Cuties.
I'm
going
to
keep
you.
Your
Majesty.
Born
with
the
powers,
or
cursed?

Born.
Here,
here.
You
are
lucky
it
wasn't
her
heart.
The
heart
is
not
so
easily
changed.
But
the
head
can
be
persuaded.
Do
what
you
must.
I
recommend
we
remove
all
magic.
Even
memories
of
magic,
to
be
safe.
But
don't
worry.

She
will
be
okay.
But
she
won't
remember
It's
for
the
best.
Listen
to
me,
Elsa.
There
is
beauty
in
it...
But
also
great
danger.

Fear
will
be
your
enemy.

KING:
No!
We'll
protect
her.
She
can
learn
to
control
it.
Until
then...
We'll
lock
the
gates.
We'll
reduce
the
staff.
We
will
limit
her
contact
and
keep
her
powers
Including
Anna.

Ah.

Elsa?

CAPTAIN:

Welcome
to
Arendelle!
Watch
your
step,
please.
The
gates
will
be
opening
soon.
Why
do
I
have
to
wear
this?
Because
the
queen
has

Day!

Hey!
I'm
so
sorry.
Hey.

Uh...

Are
you
sure?
Yeah.
I
just
wasn't
But
I'm
great,
actually.
Oh...
Thank
goodness.
Oh!
Uh...
Prince
Hans
of
the
Southern
Isles.
Princess
Anna
of
Arendelle.
"Princess"?
My
Lady.
Oh!
Whoa.

Um...
Hi.
Again.

Oh,
boy!
This
is
awkward.
Not
"You're
awkward,"
I'm
awkward,
you're
gorgeous.
I'd
like
to
formally
apologize
for
hitting
the
princess
And
for
every
moment
after.
No!
No,
no.
It's
fine.
I'm
not
that
princess.
I
mean,
if
you
it
would
be...
Yeesh!
Because,
you
know...
Hello.
But,
lucky
you,
it's
just
me.
"Just"
you?


The
bells.
The
coronation.

I
better
go.
I
have
to
go.
Bye!

Oh,
no.
Oh!




Your
Majesty,
the
gloves.



Queen
Elsa
of
Arendelle.
ALL:
Queen
Elsa
of
Arendelle!




Queen
Elsa
of
Arendelle.
Princess
Anna
of
Arendelle.


Oh.
Here?
Are
you
sure?
Because
I
don't
think
Oh.
Okay.

Hi.
"Hi"
me?
Oh...
Um...
Hi.
You
look
beautiful.
Thank
you.

I
mean,
not
"fuller."
But
more
beautiful.

Thank
you.
So...
This
is
what
a
party
looks
like.
It's
warmer
than
I
thought.
What
is
that
amazing
smell?

BOTH:
Chocolate.

KAI:
Your
Majesty.
The
Duke
of
Weaseltown.
Duke
of
Weselton,
Your
Majesty.
As
your
closest
partner
in
that
I
offer
you
your
first
dance
as
queen.
One-two,
and
jump.


Uh...
Thank
you.
Oh...
But
my
sister
does.
What?
Oh,
I
don't
think...
DUKE:
If
you
swoon,
Sorry.

an
agile
peacock.

Speaking
of,
so
great
Why
did
they
shut
them
Do
you
know
No.
All
right.
Hang
on!
They
don't
call
me
the
"Little
Dipper"
for
nothing!
Oh-ho!
Like
a
chicken
with
the
face
WOMAN:
Your
Majesty.
DUKE:
Let
me
know
when
you're
ready
for
another
round,
Milady.

Well,
he
was
sprightly.

Especially
Are
you
okay?
I've
never
been
better.
I
wish
it
could
be
Me,
too.
But
it
can't.
Why
not?

Excuse
me
for
a
minute.


MAN:
I'd
be
honored.

Glad
I
caught
you.
Hans.


I
often
had
a

parlor
Oh!
Sorry.
Your
physique
helps,
I'm

too.

Ah.

What's
this?
Uh,
I

it.
Although,
I
dreamed
I
like
it.
Yeah,
the
whole
thing.
You
got
it.
Okay,
wait,

Twelve
older
brothers.
Three
of
them
literally,
for
two
years.
That's
horrible.
It's

brothers
do.
And
sisters.
Elsa
and
I
were

But
then,
one

I'm

we
haven't
worked
out
We'll
need
a

Of

we'll
have
soup,
roast
Wait.
Would
we
live
here?
Here?
Anna!
We
can
invite
all
12
of
your
What?
No,
no,
no.
Of
course
we
have
the
room.
No
one's
brothers
are
staying
here.
No
one
is
getting
married.
Wait,
what?
May
I
talk
to
you,
please?
No.
Whatever
you
have
to
say,
Fine.
You
can't
marry
You
can
if
it's
true
love.
Anna,
what
do
you
know
More
than
you.
All
you
know
is
how

You
asked
for
my
blessing,
Now,
excuse
me.
Your
Majesty,
if
I
may
ease
your...
No,
you
may
not.

The
party
is
over.
KAI:
Yes,
Your
Majesty.
Elsa,
no,
no!
Wait.
Give
me
my
glove!
Elsa,
please,
please.
I
can't
live
like
this
anymore!
Then
leave.


What
did
I
ever
do
to
you?
Enough,
Anna.
No,
why?
Why
do
you
shut
the
world
out?
What
are
you
so
afraid
of?
I
said,
enough!


Sorcery.
I
knew
there
was
something
Elsa.

WOMAN:
There
she
is!


MAN
1:
Yes!
It
is
her!
Queen
Elsa.
MAN
2:
Our
beautiful
queen!
Your
Majesty?
No.



There
she
is!
Stop
her!
Please,
just
stay
away

Monster.
Monster!


Elsa!

ANNA:
Elsa!

Wait,
please!
Elsa,
stop!
Anna!
No.
The
fjord.
Snow!
Yes,
snow.
Are
you
all
right?
Did
you
know?
No.
Look,
it's
snowing.
The
queen
has
cursed
this
land!
She
must
be
stopped!
Wait,
no!
You!
Is
there
sorcery
in
you,
too?
Are
you
a
monster,
too?
No,
no.
That's
right,
she
is.
In
the
best
way.
And
my
sister
is
not
a
monster.
She
nearly
killed
me!
You
slipped
on
ice.
It
was
an
accident.
She
didn't
mean
it.
Tonight
was
my
fault.
So,
I'm
the
one
that
needs
to
go
after
her.
Bring
me
my
horse,
please.
It's
too
dangerous.

Elsa
is
I'll
bring
her
back,
I'm
coming
with
you.
No,
I
need
you
here
On
my
honor.

I
leave
Prince
Hans
in
charge.

Are
you
sure
you
can
trust
her?
I
don't
want
you
getting
hurt.
She's
my
sister.
She
would
never
hurt
me.

Elsa!
Elsa,
it's
me,
Anna,
your
sister
who
didn't
mean
I'm
sorry.
Of
course,
none
of
it

she

She's

stinker.

Whoa!

Oh,
no.
No,
no,
no!
No,
no,
no!

Okay.



Snow.

Wait,

Kristoff!

Don't
come
back!
We
won't.


Hey,

were
right.

I
can't
feel
my
legs!

Those
are
my
legs.
Hey,

me
a
favor,
grab
my
butt.
Oh.

feels
better.
Hey,

found
us.

to

like
that.

Thank
you.
How's

have
a
skull.
Or
bones.
So,

what?

Now
what?
Oh...
What
am

gonna
do?
She
threw
me
out.
I
can't
go
back
to
Arendelle
And
then
there's
your
ice
business.
Hey,
hey.
Don't
worry
Worry
about
your
hair!
What?
I
just
fell
off
a
cliff.
No,
yours
is
turning
white.
White?
It's...
It's
because
she
struck
you,
Does
it
look
bad?
No.
No,
I
didn't.
Anna,
you
need
help,
okay?
Okay!
Where
are
we
going?
To
see
my
friends.
The
love
experts?
Love
experts?
And
don't
worry,

do

I've

Control
it.
Don't

Don't
feel.
Don't
feel.
Don't
feel!


Look,
Sven,
the

is
awake.

Are
you
cold?

Uh...
Huh?
Ooh.

So,
uh,
about
my
friends.
I
say
"friends"...
They're
more
like
family.
Anyway,
when
I
was
a
kid,
Until
they,
you
know,
They
did?
I
don't
want
to
scare
you.
They
can
be
a
little

Very
loud.
They
are
also
stubborn
at
times,
and
a
little
overbearing.
And
heavy.

But
you'll

they
sound
wonderful.
Okay,

Hey,
guys.
They're

Don't

Oh,
no.
What

Why
did
you
bring
me
here?
I
couldn't
just
let
them
kill
you.
But
I'm
a
danger
Anna
has
not
returned.
If
you
would
just
stop
the
winter.
Bring
back
summer,
please.
Don't
you
see?
I
can't.

You
have
to
tell
them
to
let
me
go.
I
will
do
what
I
can.





Just
hang
in
there.
Come
on,
buddy,
faster!

Oh,
boy!
Whoa!
I'll
meet
you
guys
KRISTOFF:
Stay
out
of
sight,
Olaf.
OLAF:
I
will!
Hello!

It's
Princess
Anna!




Are
you
gonna
be
okay?
Don't
worry
about
me.

You
had
us
worried
sick.
Get
her
warm.
And
find
We
will.
Thank
you.
Make
sure
she's
safe.
WOMAN:
Oh,
you
poor
girl,
Oh,
let's
get
you
inside
now


I'm
going
back
out
You
cannot
risk
going
If
anything
happens
to
her...
If
anything
happens
you
are
all
Arendelle
has
left.

Prince
Hans.
Anna.
You're
so
cold.
Hans,
you
have
to
kiss
me.
Now!
Now!
We'll
give
you
two
some
privacy.
What
happened
out
there?
Elsa
struck
me
with
her
powers.
You
said
she
would
I
was
wrong.


She
froze
my
heart,
and
only
an
act
A
true
love's
kiss.
Oh,
Anna.
If
only
there
was
someone
What?
You
said
you
did.
As
thirteenth
in
line
in
my
own
kingdom,
I
didn't
stand
a
chance.
I
knew
I
would
have
to
marry
into
the
throne
somewhere.
What...
What
are
you
talking
about?
As
heir,
Elsa
was
But
no
one
was
getting
But
you...
You
were
so
desperate
for
love,
you
were
willing
I
figured
after
we
married,
I
would
have
to
stage
Hans!

But
then,
she
doomed
herself,
and
you
were
dumb
enough
Please.
All
that's
left
now
and
bring
back
summer.
You're
no
match
for
Elsa.
No,
you're
no
match
for
Elsa.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
am
the
hero
who
is
going
to
save
You
won't
get
away
with
this.
Oh...
I
already
have.


Please,
somebody,
help.

Please.
Please.

DUKE:
It's
getting
colder
If
we
don't
do
something
soon,
Prince
Hans.
Princess
Anna
is...
Dead.
What?
What
happened
to
her?

She
was
killed.
By
Queen
Elsa.
ALL:

No!
Her
own
sister.
At
least
we
got
to
say
before
she
died
in
my
arms.
There
can
be
no
doubt
now.
Queen
Elsa
is
a
monster,
and
we
are
all
in
grave
danger.
Prince
Hans,
Arendelle
looks
to
you.
With
a
heavy
heart,
I
charge
Queen
Elsa
And
sentence
her
to
death.


GUARD
2:
She's
dangerous.
Move
quickly.

It
won't
open!
GUARD
2:
Put
your
back
into
it!
GUARD
4:
Come
on!
Push!




What
is
it,
buddy?
Hey,
watch
it.
What's
wrong
with
you?

I
don't
understand
you

Stop
it!

No,
Sven!
We're
not
going
back.
She's
with
her
true
love.


What
the...
Anna!


Come
on!



Help.


Anna!
Oh,
no.


Olaf?
Olaf.
Get
away
from
there.
Wow!
So,
this
is
heat.
I
love
it.
Ooh!
But
don't
touch
it.

So,
where's
Hans?
I
was
wrong
about
him.
But
we
ran
all
the
way
here.
Please,
Olaf,
you
can't
I
am
not
leaving
here
until
we
find
some
other
act
Do
you
happen
to
have
any
ideas?
I
don't
even
know
what
love
is.
That's
okay,
I
do.
Love
is
putting
someone
else's
Like,
you
know,
how
Kristoff
brought
you

Kristoff
loves
me?
Wow,
you
really
don't
know
Olaf,
you're
melting.
Some
people
are
worth
melting
for.

Just
maybe
not
right
this
second.

Don't
worry,
I've
got
it.

We're
gonna
get
through...
Hang
on,
I'm
getting
something.

It's
Kristoff
and
Sven!
They're
coming
back
this
way.
They...
They
are?
Wow!
He's
really
moving
fast.
I
guess
I
was
wrong.
I
guess
Kristoff
doesn't
love
Help
me
up,
Olaf.
Please.
No,
no,
no!
I
need
to
get
to
Kristoff.
Why?

Oh,
I
know
why!
There's
your
act
Riding
across
the
fjords
like
a
Come
on!

OLAF:
Look
out!



Uh...
Back
this
way.





Oh...

Whoa!

Slide,
Anna!




We
made
it!
Go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go!


Come
on,
buddy,
faster.

Kristoff!

Keep
going!
Kristoff!
Come
on!


No.


Whoa!

Whoa!
Sven...
Sven!

Good
boy.



Kristoff.
Kristoff...
Anna!

Elsa!
You
can't
run
from
this!
Just
take
care
of
my
sister.
Your
sister?
She
returned
from
the
mountain
She
said
that
you
froze
her
heart.
No.
I
tried
to
save
her,
Her
skin
was
ice.
Your
sister
is
dead.
Because
of
you.
No.





Kristoff.


Elsa?

No!



Anna!
Oh.
Anna!
No,
no!
Please,
no.


Anna?





Oh,
Elsa.
You
sacrificed
yourself
for
me?
I
love
you.

"An
act
of
true
love
"Love
will
thaw."
Love.
Of
course.
Elsa?
Love!


I
knew
you
could
do
it.
Hands
down,
this
is
And,
quite
possibly,
the
last.
Oh,
Olaf!
Oh,
oh,
oh!

My
own
personal
flurry!


Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Anna?
But
she
froze
your
heart.
The
only
frozen
heart


Wonderful!


SAILOR:
Setting
course,
sir.

I
will
return
this
scoundrel
We
shall
see
what
his
12
big

This
is
unacceptable.
I
am

victim
of
fear.
Ah!
My
neck
hurts.

And
I
demand
to

here
I
come.

Pole!
Okay,
okay.
Here
we
are.
Oh!

ANNA:
I
owe
you
a
sled.
Are
you
serious?
And
it's
the
latest
model.
No,
I
can't
accept
this.
You
have
to.
No
returns.
She's
named
you
the
Official
What?
That's
not
a
thing.
And
it
even
has
a
cup
holder.
Like
it?
I
love
it!
Whoa.
I
could
kiss
you!
I
could.
I
mean,

May
I?
We
me.
Wait,
what?
We
may.
Mmm.
Summer!


Ooh...
Hello.









Are
you
ready?


KID:
Ice!



WOMAN:
Ooh!
Whoo-hoo...
Swing
me.

Ooh...

I
like
the
open
gates.
We
are
never
closing
them
again.

Oh,
Elsa,
they're
beautiful,
Come
on!
KRISTOFF:
Look
out.
I
got
it,
I
got
it.
I
don't
Hey,
guys!
That's
it,
Olaf.
Glide
and
pivot.
ELSA:
Go.








Oh!
