JAKE:
Watch
your
step,
Ma.
Oh,
God.

BRAND:
What
is
this?
DATA:
Oh,
great.
Jerk
alert!

Somebody's
coming.
You
there,
Ma?
Hurry
up.
ANDY:
Data,
hurry
up!
-
I
got
a
great
idea.
Slick
shoes!
ANDY:
Data,
come
on!
Good
enough.
I
can
see
their
flashlight!
Hi,
fellas.
Remember
me?
We
just
wanna
get
out
of
here.
Stop
or
I'm
gonna
shoot!
MIKEY:
-
You'll
start
a
cave-in!
STEF:
Hurry
up
with
that
flare!
-
Do
you
have
a
match?
I'll
light
it
on
the
lamp.
-
Cross
now!
-
Don't
push,
Jake!

Sweetheart,
are
you
okay?

BRAND:
Wow.
What
is
that?
STEF:
-
Yo.
Gnarly.
That's
atrocious,
you
guys!
Help
him!
Help
him!
Hurry
up!

Oh.

MAMA:
Stop
playing
around!
They're
getting
"To
move
on,
play
the
tune...
...as
each
note
is
said.
If
you
make
too
many
mistakes...
...ye
will
surely
be...
-
Be
what?
-
What
is
that?
Come
on.
Oh,
God!
We
gotta
play
the
bones
Exactly.
DATA:
They're
on
the
bridge.
MIKEY:
Look!
There
are
notes
on
this.
-
I
was
4
years
old.
-
Hit
it!
Finding
middle
C.
This
isn't
DATA:
This
first
chord,
I
think,
is....
Go
on,
Andy!

My
God,
it's
working!
You
did
it!
-
Way
to
go,
Andy!
Way
to
go!
A.
-
C
sharp,
D.


They're
coming,
guys.
-
What
should
I
do?
They're
coming.
You
guys,
they
look
really
pissed
off!


-
What
were
you
thinking?
-
I'm
not
Liberace,
you
know.
Andy,
I
believe
in
you.
Just
don't
make
any
more.
Come
on.
Where
was
I?
-
A,
A
flat.

Hey,
you
guys,
they're
gone!


FRANCIS:

I
can't
tell
if
it's
an
A
sharp
or
a
B
flat.
If
you
hit
the
wrong
note,

Oh,
my
God!
MIKEY:
BRAND:
Oh,
my
God!
Give
me
the
gun.
Give
me
the
gun!
ANDY:
-
Brand,
wait!
-
What
are
you
doing?
BRAND:
Damn
it!



MOUTH:
BRAND:
STEF:
Are
you
okay,
Mouth?
Andy?
What?
-
Oh,
my
God.

Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
God!
-
Follow
me.
I
can't
do
it,
Mama.
Francis.
MAMA:
MIKEY:
The
water's
really
shallow.
MOUTH:

You
really
think
there's
a
treasure
here?
Andy,
this
whole
ship's
a
treasure.
Oh!
Mikey,
look!
Don't
worry.
It's
just
a
skeleton.
There's
gotta
be
gold.

Data.
Data's
okay.

Ah!
Guys!

Data's
okay.
Data's
quite
tired
of
falling!
BRAND:
Why
didn't
you
use
the
stairs?
Stairs!
The
stupid
guys
tell
me
to
use
-
If
Data's
hurt,
nobody
cares
anymore.
Then
some
guy
tells
me
I've
been
spending
months
and
months...
...studying
on
them
-
Don't
touch
that.
ANDY:
Have
some
respect.
How
many
ships
were
there?
-
Billions.
Watch
where
you
step,
all
right?
MIKEY:
Translate
nothing.
It's
a
sketch
Where's
the
gold?!
Where's
the
gold,
Mikey?!
ANDY:
I
set
off
another
trap.
Oh,
God!
I'm
sorry.
Are
you
okay?
Oh,
my
God!
MIKEY:
Ready?
Break
through.
-
What's
up
there?
-
Just
give
me
a
second.
I
know
how
these
guys
must've
died.
What
a
mess.
It's
Willy.
One-Eyed
Willy.
Hi,
Willy.
I'm
Mike
Walsh.
...haven't
you?
I
made
it.
I
beat
you.
I
got
here
in
one
piece
so
far.

So...
...that's
why
they
call
you
We
have
a
lot
in
common,
huh,
Willy?
You
know
something,
Willy?
You're
the
first
Goonie.
Yo.
Hi,
guys.
How's
it
going?
This
is
Willy.
One-Eyed
Willy.
Say
hi,
Willy.
Those
are
my
friends,
the
Goonies.
How
long
have
you
been
there?
Long
enough,
Mikey.
Long
enough.
What
are
you
staring
at?
-
Anything
that
fits
in
your
pockets.
MIKEY:
-
Why?
Save
that
for
Willy.
Anything
else.
MIKEY:
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God!
Hurry
up!
Those
creeps
are
still
after
us.
-
That's
right!
What
will
we
do?
-
I
got
an
idea.
MIKEY:
We
leave
a
trail
of
jewels
...and
we
hide
in
another.
When
the
Fratellis
go
into
that
cave,
Now
that
sounds
like
a
great
idea!
Yo.
-
Outside!
-
Data,
don't
do
anything!
I
said,
outside!
-
We
won't
be
taken
alive,
matey!
Get
Data!
MIKEY:
It's
not
funny!
She's
got
a
gun!
MAMA:
-
Oh,
I
love
that.
Sneaking
up
on
me,
huh?
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
DATA:
Data's
just
unhappy.

DATA:
-
Get
it
off
me!

MAMA:
My
gun!
FRANCIS:
Empty
your
pockets!
Hurry
up,
empty
your
jewels!
Come
on!
You're
so
quiet
all
of
a
sudden.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

Oh,
my
God.
-
Is
that
all?
Oh,
my
God.
You
gross
old
witch.

You
wanna
play
pirate?
-
Keep
going,
smarty.
We'll
play
pirates.
Walk
the
plank!
Get
out
on
that
plank.
-
Say
goodbye
to
your
little
friends.

BRAND:
Two
down.
Who's
next?
STEF:
-
You're
pulling
my
hair!
Go
join
your
friends,
you
weasels.
SLOTH:
SLOTH:

-
Chunk.
Sloth!
How'd
he
get
out?
Sloth,
save
them!


Sloth!
-
Chunk.
Give
me
the
sword.
Aah!
Captain
Chunk
says
let's
get
the
hell

Francis.
The
rope.
Jump
rope,
Slothy.
-
What
do
you
mean,
"jump
rope"?
-
Jump
rope.


Sloth!
We're
in
deep
shit
now.
Oh,
shit.
-
Remember
we
went
to
the
Bronx
Zoo?
-
They
wanted
to
leave
you.
I
said
no.
Remember
how
they
bought
Francis
-
I
don't
wear
a
hairpiece!
Here,
grab
on
to
the
rock.
Come
on.

What
happened
to
your
braces?
Mikey
wear--
-
Mikey,
that
little--
Heave-ho!
Goodbye,
boys!

-
I
won't
sing
no
more.
I
won't
sing
anymore.
Hey,
you
guys!
Mama.
Come
to
Mama,
baby.
Come
on.
Ma...
...you've
been
bad.
Aw.
Slothy,
I
may
have
been
bad.
I
may
have
kept
you
chained
in
Aw.
I
used
to
sing
to
you.

When
you
were
a
little
boy.

Fall!
Break!
Fall!
I
only
dropped
you
once.

Well,
maybe
twice.

Put
me
down.
-
I
don't
mind
dying.
-
We'll
be
okay.

I
gotta
rot
with
you
through
eternity?
Hey,
you
guys!
Sloth,
this
is
the
guys.
Brand,
we
can't
go.
We
can't
leave
If
we
stay
here,
we
got
no
future.
-
All
that
rich
stuff.
Mama!
Mama,
just
let
us
down
easy.
Not
the
sword!
Oh,
no!
-
You
all
right?
Yeah.
Will
you
get
up?!
Let's
go
find
the
gold.
BRAND:
Thank
you,
Mr.
Willy.
Thank
you.
You've
made
my
day.
This
is
a
real
treat.
JAKE:
-
Another
one
of
those
booby
traps!
Get
out
of
here!
What
booby
traps?
-
Oh,
booby
traps!
JAKE:
BRAND:
There's
been
a
cave-in
before.
I
can't
see.
Got
a
light?
I
got
the
last
candle.
Mikey,
get
it.
Is
there
a
way
out
or
what?
This
is
a
funny
candle.
It's
sparkling.
-
It's
not
a
candle,
it's
dynamite!


MAMA:
-
You
guys,
push.
What
about
the
loot?
What
about
our
lives?

Can
you
do
it?
Come
on,
hurry.
Go!
BRAND:
-
Sloth!
Sloth!
Help
us!
Ma!
Chunk!
Sloth,
come
on!
Sloth
love
Chunk!
I
love
you
too.
You're
gonna
get
crushed.

Sloth,
help!
Ma!
CHUNK:

MAN:
Well,
I'll
be
damned.
They
weren't
here
a
minute
ago.
-
But
they're
here
now.
Call
Harvey.
CHUNK:
Here!

MAN:
Get
the
camera.
-
Mikey.
Brand.
MIKEY:
-
I
guess
we're
kind
of
in
deep
sh--

Look,
you're
a
mess.
-
Look
what
we
brought
you.
-
Your
favorite.
-
We
were
in
the
tunnels.
-
I
lost
my
glasses.
Can
I
take
piano
lessons?
MRS.
WALSH:
You'll
get
ammonia.
MRS.
WALSH:
Hold
it
right
there.
That's
great,
Dad.
Just
watch
this.
Come
here,
Daddy.
He's
just
like
his
father.

I
just
wanted
to
say
thank
you...
...for
offering
to
save
-
What,
what,
what?
Wow.
"Thank
you."
A
real
moment.
Your
voice
is
kind
of
nice
when
Yeah,
well,
thanks.
And
you
know,
...when
your
face
doesn't
screw
it
up.
I'm
just
kidding.
Hey,
Mikey.
Hey.
You
know,
you're
a
great
You
keep
kissing
girls
the
way
you
do...
...the
parts
of
you
...they'll
catch
up
to
the
ones
that
do.
-
What?
Oh,
who
needs
it?
It's
the
Fratellis!
FRANCIS:
Thank
God
you're
here.
SHERIFF:
Hey!
Don't
shoot
him!
-
Look
out,
kid.
Get
them
out
of
here.
These
are
the
bad
guys!
Those
are
the
bad
guys!
Put
him
down,
Sloth.

Come
on,
Mama.
You
have
no
idea
who
I
am.
Sloth.
You're
gonna
live
with
me
now.
Huh?
I'm
gonna
take
care
of
you.
Because
I
love
you.
-
I
love
you,
Chunk.
Walsh,
today's
the
day,
Irving?
-
I'm
sorry,
Irene.
There's
50
houses
MR.
WALSH:
Ease
off,
Brand.
Sheriff,
I
want
you
to
witness
this.
Sorry,
Dad.
We
had
our
hands
on
the
future.
But
we
blew
it
to
save
our
own
lives.
Sorry.
That's
all
right.
You
and
Brand
That
makes
us
PERKINS:
...you're
looking
at
the
richest
people
I'm
sure
gonna
miss
being
a
Goonie.


What's
she
saying,
Mouth?
-
No
pen.
No
write.
No
sign!
Don't
sign!
BRAND:
What's
in
the
bag?
Dad!
It's
my
marble
bag!
I
put
the
jewels
in
it.
There'll
be
no
more
signing
today

Are
those
jewels
real?
Were
your
lives
in
danger?
-
The
octopus
was
scary.
-
It
was
dangerous.
Walking
the
plank?
-
Then
we
found
the
pirate
ship.
-
We
were
chased
by
the
Fratellis.
-
Telling
more
stories,
Lawrence?
How
do
you
think
we
got
the
gold?
Holy
Mary,
Mother
of
God.
-
Look
at
that.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
...and
what
appears
to
be
a
pirate
ship....
Bye,
Willy.
Thanks.
