Someone
who

A

Then
he
spoke
English
for
the

since
his
schooldays,
Just
before
dashing
his

against

suddenly
shouted:
''Tierra

An

And

A
passer-by

in

A

at

to

to

No

Sit
at
the

at

even
by
a
nod.
Every

Wrestling,

Having

it

be
nice,
to

Philip

to
have
a
fever,
To
be
excited
not
only
by
the
mind,
By
the
line
of
a
neck,
To
lie.
Through
one's
teeth.
As
you're
walking,
At

to
guess
To
be
able
to
say:
instead
of:
''Yes
and
amen.''
To
be
able
to
enthuse
for
evil...
to
draw
all
the
demons
and
to
chase
them
out
into
the
world.
To
be
a
savage.
Or
to
feel
how
it
is
to
take
off
and
to
wriggle
your
toes,
barefoot,
Stay
alone.
Let

Keep

We

no

Remain

The

And

again.
Moments

Someone
who'd

That

up
and
the

and
fills
my
heart.
As
a
child,
A
woman

gloriously
alone.
Yes,
that's
it.
Everything
so
empty,
incompatible.
Emptiness,
fear.
La

la

Fear.
Like
a
small
animal,
Who
are
you?
But

Must
not

That's
how
it
is.

Emptiness,
such
emptiness...
What

Not

a
stranger,
You
can't

for

photo
at

That
could
be
the
beginning
of
a

The

l'd
like
to
see
faces.
Maybe
l'll
find
a
job
as
a
waitress.
This
evening
scares
me.
lt's
silly,
fear
makes
me
sick.
Only
part
of

How
should
l
live?
How
should

so
little.
Maybe
Sometimes

Longing...
longing.

Longing
for

That's

clumsy,
Desire
to

Desire
to

Don't

The

The

The

The

The

My

My

My
