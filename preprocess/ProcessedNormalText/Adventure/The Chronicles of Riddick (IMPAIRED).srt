in
the
Riddick!
GUARD
2:
Where
the
hell
GUV:
There
it
is.
Listen.

Let
me
guess.
Necros.
One
commander,
And
a
whole
lot
Shit!
I
hate
not
I
figure
before
the
sun
hits
us
again,
Wait.
We
gonna
do
this
or
not?
Just
wait.
Boss!


Remember
that
"Who's
The
Better
Killer?"
Let's
play.
KYRA:
Come
on!

GUV:
On
the
right!
GUV:
Watch
out!


KYRA:
No!


Kyra?
PURIFIER:
I
was
supposed
to
if
Vaako
failed
to
kill
you.
A
message
from
He
tells
you
Stay
away
from
him.
And
in
return,
But
Vaako
will
most
likely
So
this
is
your
chance.
Your
chance
to
do
The
girl.
Where
will
they
take
her?
To
the
Lord
Marshal,
I've
done
unbelievable
things
in
the
name
of
a
faith
And
he'll
do
to
her
The
Necromonger
in
me
But
the
Furyan
in
me
hopes
you
won't
listen.
We
all
began
as
MARSHAL:
I
have
lost
but
I
have
gained
It
is
overdue,
isn't
it,
that
we
acknowledge
your
steady
faith
and
above
all,
your
unflinching
loyalty?
Obedience
without
question.
Well
done,
Vaako.
This
is
a
day
of
days.
MARSHAL:
Now,
Tell
me
the
Furyan
is
gone
and
I
can
close
this
campaign
If
he
is
dead
I
sense
I'm
not
far
being
of
no
further
use
here.
Shouldn't
I
tell
you
Don't
try
me,
Aereon.
I
could
plough
you
under
No
one
really
Then
tell
me
the
odds.
That
Vaako
met
with
success.
That
I
will
now
be
the
one
conquering
or
Tell
me
it's
true,
Aereon.
And
maybe
for
last.
The
odds
are
good.
That
Riddick
is
still
alive.
Ascension
protocol!
We
still
have
Sweep
teams,
They
would
be
hard-pressed
Get
my
armada
off
the
ground.
You
mean
on
Helion?
Could
you
be
wrong?
Mind
fabricates
fear.
Not
so
wrong
as
you
It's
twice
a
mistake.
Not
only
your
failure,
How
do
we
salvage
this?
How?
Lord
Marshal's
You
will
never
He
will
kill
us
both
I
say
give
Riddick
If
he
is
half
of
he
can
at
least
wound
And
that
is
Just
to
take
his
place?
That
is
the
Necromonger
way.
It
is
not
enough!
If
he
has
fear,
If
he
has
weakness,
Vaako...
He
is
unworthy
of
Lordship.
We
do
it
for
Protect
the
faith.
This
can
still
be
But
the
timing
must
be
flawless.
Final
protocol.
We're
done
with
this
world.

Go
inside.
Ziza,
go
inside.
OFFICER:
We
found
MARSHAL:
Show
me
Commander
Toal.
He
won't
escape
twice.


Stay
your
weapons.
He
came
for
me.
MARSHAL:
Consider
this.
If
you
fall
here
now,
you'll
never
rise.
But
if
you
the
Necromonger
way...
Go
to
him.
It
hurts
at
first.
But
after
a
while,
Are
you
with
me,
Kyra?
There's
a
moment
when
you
He
makes
it
sound
perfect.
A
place
where
Are
you
with
me,
Kyra?
Convert
now
or
fall
forever.
You
killed
everything
I
know.

Vaako.
Not
yet.
Been
a
long
time

MARSHAL:
These
are
his

MARSHAL:
Give
me
your
soul,


Never.
You
are
not
the
one


Now!
Kill
the
beast
Help
me,
Vaako.
Kill
him.
Vaako?
Forgive
me.
Flawless.
No.
No!
I
thought
you
were
dead.
Are
you
with
me,
Kyra?
I
was
always
with
you.
I
was.
You
keep
what
you
kill.
Now,
what
would
be
This
dark
army
at
And
the
fate
of
Well,
not
even
I
dare
