Begin

I
just
spoke
to

Very
good.
Mai,
get
ready
for
the
downloads.
ID,
sir.
Park
behind
the
transpo.
We'll
lead
you
in.
Man
the

You're
with
me.

Anthrax
alarms
only
went
off
on
five
floors.
I
don't
know
why
you'd
need
to
go
further.


Go
again.
Rodriguez!
I
didn't
copy.

Gate
secured.
OK,
we
are
in.
This
is
insane.
Hey!
Hey,
this
is
absurd.
Man,
there's
tough
and
there's
stupid.
I'm
not
a
doctor,
but
you're
hurt.
-
Yeah.
Sexy,
right?
Come
on.
We
don't
need
a
doctor.
He's
in.
Get
outta
the
way!
Watch
out!
Excuse
me!
Excuse
me!
NYPD.
All
right?
I
got
this
kid.

Excuse
me.
Thanks.
NYPD.
NYPD.
Coming
through.
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
I
need
to
speak
to
you.
-
The
medic's
in
the
back.
Just
give
me
a
minute.
Sergeant!

Oh,
my
God.
Let's
get
outta
here.
Perfetto.

Siamo
pronti.
We're
a
go.
Launch
the
downloads.
-
Nothing's
happening.
-
I
don't
know.
It's
not
responding.
See?
There
you
go.
-
Tell
me
when
the
download
reaches
20%.
-
I
need
you
to
please
remain
calm.
Excuse
me.
-
Excuse
me!
Thank
you.
-
Kid?
Kid,
hey!
-
You
got
a
phone
in
that
bag?
Come
on.
Let's
go.
And
here
you
go,
Agent...
Tovarek.
-
Download's
at
20%.
Let's
keep
them
chasing
their
tails.

Due
to
recent
activity,
Iaw
They
are
telling
drivers
to
abandon
And,
as
you
can
see,
Whether
this
is
connected
to
or
a
new
terrorist
threat,
we
do
not
know...
-
FAA
just
grounded
all
flights.
We
have
complete
access
over

-
Hey,
excuse
me.
Chuck
Summer,
DHS
liaison.
-
Anything
you
need,
we're
here
to
help.
We're
gonna
need
some
work
space
As
you
can
see,
we're
using
the
space,
so
If
I
need
something,
I'll
just
wave
to
you.
-
Wait!
No,
don't
call.
They
probably
cracked
that
hours
ago.
-
You
sure?
Or...
smash
it.
-
Excuse
me.
It's
a
police
emergency.
He'll
call
you
right
back.
Here,
right
in
here.
Come
here.
-
You
got
a
signal?

-
Yeah.
Sir,
John
McClane
is
on
the
line.
-
McClane,
go.
They
came
after
the
kid
again.
-
What
about
Farrell?
-
Sir?
Yeah,
I'll
hold
on.
Another
day
in
paradise.
They
just
swarmed
into
everything
-
the

"America
the
Beautiful"

Oh,
beautiful,
for
spacious
skies...
For
amber
waves
of
grain
For
purple
mountain
majesties
Above
the
fruited
plain!
America!
America!
God
shed
His
grace...
-
Can
you
put
the
news
back
on?
-
Been
this
way
for
a
few
minutes
now.
From
sea
to
shining
sea...

Oh,
my
God.
McClane!
Look
out.
Look
out!
Look
out.
Bowman?
Bowman,
do
you
see
that?
Bowman,
it's
a
fake.
I
see
it.
Thank
God.
Oh,
shit.
-
McClane?

Satellite's
down.
Get
me
a
land
line.

I
wrote
one
little
piece
of
code
and
the
-
What?
The
first
time
I
heard
of
the
concept
I
actually
thought
it
would
be
cool
Just
hit
the
reset
button
Hey,
it's
not
a
system.
It's
a
country.
You're
talkin'
about
people,
sitting
at
home
alone,
scared
to
death
So
finish
your
nostalgic
moment
and
think
Just
help
me.
Come
on.
If
this
were
yourfire
sale,
OK,
uh,
well,
the
whole
point
of
a
fire
sale
But
not
everything
is
run
completely
online.
They're
run
by
closed
circuits,
but
to
shut
it
down
you'd
have
to
And,
uh...
-
Give
me
that
guy's
PDA.
No,
it's
the
network
that's
dead.
I've
just
gotta
Hackers
surf
'em
all
the
time.
Probably
what
How
do
you
know
all
this
stuff?
Dude,
I
don't
know.
There's
a
lot
OK.
National
power
grid.
Gas
and
electric
is
divided
into
three
zones
-
each
with
a
primary
hub.
Here
it
is.
-
What
are
we
looking
at?
Now,
they
take
this
out,
wipes
out
all
But,
again,
you'd
have
to
do
it
manually.
-
OK.
Come
on.
Let's
go.
I
honestly
don't
think
I
can
handle
-
You
get
used
to
it.
Sir,
wireless
networks
are
down
I
don't
care
how,
you
find
me
a
line.
-
Come
on,
what
you
got?
-
We
can
sweep
it
again...
It's
a
fake.
This
guy's
playin'
us.
OK,
get
everyone
back
inside
OK,
let's
open
it
up!
-
Come
on,
get
in.
Unless
you
have
an
extra
gun
Hey.
Hey,
don't
do
that!
Jesus
Christ!
That
was
crazy.
Did
you
see
that?
Sorry
about
that,
man.
Man,
this
is
a
pain
in
the
ass.
You
all
right?
What?
Did
it
hit
you
a
little
bit?
Sorry.
No,
please
don't
touch
those,
OK?
I
mean,
I've
read
about
it.
RoadAssist.
We've
detected
Yes...
Please,
we
just
hit
a
tree
I
think
he's
gonna
die.
You
need
to
help
us.
Hold
while
we
contact
emergency
services.
No,
no!
He's
dying!
I
can
get
him
But
I
can't
really
turn
the
key,
so
you
gotta
-
Your
name,
please?
My
name
is...
Frank,
and
my
dad's
name
is,
um...
is...

Dvorak...
Tsajanski.
Please...
Please,
just
help
us.
Emergency
services
are
on
their
way.
No,
no,
listen
to
me.
-
Dolores.
OK,
Dolores,
I
don't
know
and
I
wanna
be
able
to
say
that
Because
my
dad
is
my
hero,
and
his
only
hope
is
to
get
to
a
hospital
So
please
start
the
goddamn
car!

Thank
you,
Dolores.

Pass
the
PDA.
-
The
what?
-Ma'am,
you're
not
authorised
to
be
here.
You
can't
land
here
without
authorisa...
That
was
pretty
good
back
there,
kid.
Thanks.
What's
the
matter
with
you?
No.
I'm
just...
-
Well,
what?
What's
the
matter
you?
What's
that
mean?
Like
what?
I'm
not,
like,
heroic
and
everything.
-
I'm
not
that
guy.
You've
saved
my
life,
like,
Just
doing
my
job,
that's
all.
Know
what
you
get
for
being
a
hero?
You
get
a
little
pat
on
the
back,
You
get
divorced.
A
wife
that
can't
remember
your
last
name.
Your
kids
don't
wanna
talk
to
you.
You
get
to
eat
a
lot
of
meals
by
yourself.
Trust
me,
kid,
nobody
wants
to
be
that
guy.
-
Then
why
are
you
doin'
this?
If
there
was
somebody
else
to
do
it,
But
there's
not.
So
we're
doin'
it.
Ah.
And
that's
what
makes
you
that
guy.
Thing's
flying
now.
Contact
Emerson.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Stay
here.
All
right,
come
on.
-
We're
in.
Guess
you
were
right,
kid.
OK,
that's...
awful.
We
got
company.
-
How
would
they
shut
down
a
power
grid?
-
Come
on.
-
Uh,
fourth
floor.
Fourth
floor.
You
take
the
right.
-

Shh.
-
Can
we
stop
for...
I
am!
I
just
wanna
stop
for
two
seconds
You
know,
they
have
these
things
Come
on,
let's
go.
Let's
go.
Intel's
fairly
certain
the
terrorists
are
mobile.
It's
the
only
way
With
the
amount
of
hardware
they're
running,
we're
probably
looking
for
a
large
vehicle,
All
right.
Tell
the
guys
at
Homeland
Security
we
need
every
agent,
satellite
Play
time's
over,
sweetheart.
Don't.
Take
your
hand
off
the
gun.
Hands
up.
Stand
up.
Go
on.
Now!
Let's
go,
kid.
You're
up.
OK...
As
fast
as
you
can.
Jesus!
That's
enough
of
this
kung
fu
shit.
I've
known
some
bitches
in
my
day,
Still
awake,
huh?
-
Just
keep
doin'
what
you're
doin'.
-
How
much
time
do
you
need?
Whoo.
-
Are
you
done?
-
Are
you
done?
-
What?
They
used
VM
mode,
so
I'm
isolating
-
What?!
Not
the
easiest
thing
to
do
when...
OK...
Undo
everything
you
just
did.
Now!
OK.
OK,
OK.
I'm
a
righty,
I'm
a
righty.
I'm
a
righty.
One
last
door
to
open.
Do
you
know
what
you're
doing?
Do
you
Yes,
I
do.
Now
open
the
door.
OK,
good.
Glad
we're
on
the
same
page.
You
do?
I'm
glad
you
know.
How
you
doin'?
Hang
on.

Listen,
let's
just
talk
about
this
How
you
doin'?
Damn
it!
Smile
pretty!

McClane!
Shit.
McClane,
get
out
of
there!
Come
on,
man!
Come
on!
Come
on,
man.
Did
you
see
that?


So
you
stopped
it,
right?
You
know,
a
gun
to
your
head
-
What?
-
Can't
you
just
turn
it
off?
Lock
'em
out?
I
might
be
able
to
slow
'em
down,
though.
Western
and
Central
hubs
are
ours.
Hang
on.
Something's
up.
I
think
someone
might
be
in
the
market
Now
your
girlfriend's
dead,
It's
an
e-bomb.

Hey...
All
right,
wait,
wait.
-
Mai,
talk
to
me.
What's
going
on?
Oh,
yeah
-
little
Asian
chick,
I
don't
think
she's
gonna
be
talking
Last
time
I
saw
her,
she
was
at
the
bottom
What's
the
matter?
Listen,
jackass.
Your
fire
sale
is
over.
Just
pack
up
your
little
circus
or
I'm
gonna
You
have
no
idea
who
I
am
When
I'm
finished
here
-
I
will
focus
all
my
attention...
on
you.
You
wanna
make
things
personal,
fine.
Reroute
every
cubic
foot
of
natural
gas
-
Can
you
get
Bowman
on
this
thing?
Do
it.
-
Now?
Please,
no.
-
It's
Thomas
Gabriel.
-

You
know
this
guy?
He
was
DOD's
chief
programmer
After
9/11,
he's
the
guy
that
told
He
wanted
an
overhaul,
but
they
wouldn't
You
think
so?
When
he
tried
to
go
public,
Destroyed
his
reputation,
froze
assets.
-

Hold
on
one
minute.
I
think
we
need
to
get
out
of
here
right
now.
-
They're
sending
the
gas
lines
here.
Christ.
Oh...
all
of
them.
See
that,
-
All
that's
coming
here?
Listen,
I
gotta
go.
Just
find
Thomas
Gabriel.
McClane?
McClane?
Let's
go.
Finish
this
up.

Right
now.
Finish
it
up,
come
on!
Let's
go!
Get
in
there!
You
OK?

-
Let's
go.
We
gotta
get
outta
here.
Hey,
knock
that
off,
come
on.
This
has
something
to
do
with
that
code
you
Win?
When
do
we
start
winning?
Huh?
Look
around.
Are
you
out
of
your
mind?
We
just
got
the
shit
kicked
out
of
us!
You
think
I'm
holding
out
on
you?
If
I
knew
what
they
wanted,
I
would
tell
you!
Jesus.
The
Warlock.
The
Warlock.
Oh,
great.
Ah!
There
goes
the
cellphone.
-
They
knocked
satellites
out
of
the
skies?
-
We
should
go
see
him.
The
Warlock.
We
should
drive
-
Can't
go
to
the
Warlock's
house
now.
OK?
Trust
me.
We
gotta
go
see
the
Warlock.
-
How
do
you
feel
about
flying?
-
Just
stick
it
in
the
round
thing.
Here,
put
these
on.
Just
stick
it
in
there.
That'll
work.
-
You
OK?
-
I
used
to
be
terrified
of
flying.
Yeah.
I
took
some
lessons.
-
Yeah?
Did
it
help?

-
Is
it
supposed
to
make
that
sound?
-
Maybe
we
should
just
drive.
Really?
I
heard...
-
To
be
honest,
I
missed
a
couple
of
classes.
But
you
have
your
licence,
right?
-
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.
That's
good.
That's
pretty
good.
Jesus,
look
at
that.
How
we
gonna
find
Warlock's
house?
Um,
it's
probably
gonna
be
Power
outage
keeps
spreading.
About
half
All
right.
Put
everything
How
the
hell
are
they
getting
past
us?
OK.
Down
there,
down
there.
I
see
it.
-
Down
there?
What?
Are
we
gonna
land
down
there?
-
All
right,
hang
on.
Fence.
Fence.
Fence!
-
Fence.
Fence!
Watch...
Ow!
Ohhh!

-
Oh,
Jesus.
Oh,
yeah.
Oh,
yeah.
Let's
go.
Now,
there's
something
you
need
to
know
So
just
let
me
do
all
the
talking,
OK?

Shit.
Hey,
Mrs
Kaludis.
Um,
is
Freddy
home?
I'm
Matt
Farrell
and
this
is,
uh...
Billy.
We're
friends
from...
Space
Camp.
Freddy!
-
Freddy?
Frederick!
Didn't
you
hear
me?
All
Baltimore
heard
you,
Ma.
-
Your
friends
are
here.
Come
on,
Ma!
How
many
times
I
gotta
I
can't
see
too
good.
Is
that
a
young,
bearded
No,
I
gained
30
pounds.
Who
is
that?
Dude,
what
are
you
doin'
here?
Cos
of
you,
And
since
you're
being
hunted
by
assassins,
And
hey,
don't
touch
that,
all
right?
CB
radio?
That,
my
friend,
is
an
end-of-the-world
So
when
the
last
microchip
goes
down,
whether
they
be
zombies
or
not.
-
What'd
you
bring
your
dad
here
for?
Nice
poster.
-
Oh,
what?
Like,
you
a
big
fan
of
the
Fett?
-
Star
Wars
guy.
Who
is
this
man?
Hey,
dump
truck.
I'm
not
his
dad.
-
I'm
a
cop.
How
'bout
that?
Why'd
you
bring
a
cop

Command
centre!
It's
a
basement.
-
It's
a
command
centre!
Just
tell
us
about
Thomas
Gabriel,
all
right?
Thomas
Gabriel.
I
didn't
know.
Sorry.
Get
out!
I
want
you
outta
here,
right
now.
Hey,
calm
down.
Just
calm
down,
big
boy!
You
calm
down!
It's
my
house!
You're
gonna
tell
me
what
I
wanna
know,
Four
years
ago,
the
DOD
recruits
Thomas
First
day
on
the
job,
tells
his
bosses
this
nation's
security
infrastructure
They
say,
"We'll
take
it
under
advisement."
So
he
breaks
into
a
meeting
and,
with
just
a
laptop,
hacks
into
NORAD
So
they
put
a
gun
to
the
man's
head
Thomas
Gabriel's
the
guy
who
shut
down
-
You
think
I'm
scared
of
you?
How
do
I
know?
He's
a
ghost,
man.
-
Another
dead
end.
Come
on.
Listen,
Warlock,
A
mutating
algorithmic
security
code,
that's
No,
we
know
that.
Yes.
I
don't
know.
I've
been
trying
The
only
security
system
in
the
country
currently
employing
that
template
But
they
don't
use
it
in
the
main
facility.
Look.
-
Whoa.
What
the
hell?
God!
-
What
are
you
talkin'
about?
-
It's
hot.
It's
on
fire.
Hello.
What's
a
chilling
tower?
See
what
I've
been
dealing
with?
Large
server
farms
generate
a
lot
of
heat
But
why
there?
I
don't
know
what's
in
that
building,
I
got
a
red
flag
over
here!
Honing
in
on
the
host
server
right
now.
"Frederick
Kaludis."
-
Let's
have
a
look
at
him.
McClane.
-
Where
is
his
daughter?
You'll
love
this.
All
right.
Let's
get
a
better
look
at
you.

-

Freddy?
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
McCIane?
I
thought
I
killed
you
already.
I
get
that
sometimes.
-
You
think
you
can
try
to
track
where
he
is?
Detective,
covering
the
camera
with
your
Yeah,
I
know
I'm
not
as
smart
as
you
guys
but,
hey,
I'm
still

be
all
right.

phone!
We're

bit
overloaded
tonight,
but
I
assure
you

Even
if
I
have
to
come
down
there
myself.
In
the
meantime,
is
there
anyone
Yeah.

dad.
His
name
is
John
McClane.
We'II

him.
Just
hang
in
there,
miss,
Thank

Wow.
That's
a
great
girl
you
got
there.
What's
the
matter?
Cat

your
tongue?
Come

John.
Make
a
joke.
Say
somethin'
funny.

Where...?
Hey!
McClane!
Hold
on.
What

you
think
I'm
gonna
do?
I'm
gonna

But
she
can
be
anywhere...
-
I
think
l...
I
wouldn't
bet
on
me,
all
right?
I'll
take
it
from
here.
Thanks
for
your
help.
I
wouldn't
bet
on
you
either,
Buckle

ma'am.
Jersey
field
office.
Mind
if
I
see
your
lD?
Not
at
all.
My
dad's
a
cop.
Force
of
habit.
Your
father
sounds
like
a
very
smart
man.
Kid,
can
you
get
Bowman?
Uh,
yeah.
It's
completely
dead.
Gabriel
must
have
shut
down
I'm
sorry
about
Lucy,
man.
About
all
of
it.
It
was
my
fault
you
got
into
this.
You
got
nothin'
to
be
sorry
about.

-
Let
go
of
me,
you
bastard!
Are
you
gonna
be
all
right?
Hey!
Behave
or
I
will
hurt
you.
Oh,
yeah?
Let's
step
outside,
You
really
are
his
daughter.
Tie
her
wrists.
Trey,
Gabriel
wants
to
see
you.
-
Is
it
that
time
already?
OK.
I'll
be
back
in
a
second.
No,
no,
no,
please!
-

Go
take
a
look.
Don't
be
long.
We're
packing
up
soon.
Hey,
McClane,
do
we
have
anything
Find
Lucy
and
kill
everybody
else.
No,
I
mean
more
like
a
plan.
Come
on.
OK,
according
to
the
layout,
the
chilling
I
think
mine's
locked.
OK.
Now
it
looks
like
Uh...
OK,
this
looks
like
it
controls
the
cooling
If
I
can
just
hack
in...
and
trip
the
alarm,
it
might
alert
Bowman.

Someone
set
off
the
alarms.
Yes.
Thank
you,
detective.
I
can
hear
that.
What
have
you
got?
We
got
a
problem.
It's
gotta
be
him.
And
what's
Woodlawn?
It's
NSA
-
a
secure
facility
It's
a
fail-safe
we
built
after
9/11
The
moment
networks
were
hit,
all
financial
Banks,
Wall
Street,
corporate
records,
Basically,
a
backup
for
All
in
one
location?
What
could
Gabriel
do
with
it?
If
he
could
get
in,
he
might
try
to
transfer
Then
he'd
have
access
to
those
accounts
from
We
couldn't
trace
it.
Or,
knowing
him,
he
could
erase
it
all
-
Why
the
hell
wasn't
I
told
about
this?
My
pay
grade?
How
the
hell
did
Gabriel
find
out
about
this
He
designed
it.
It
was
his
program.
He
knew
that
hacking
your
system
That's
brilliant.

going
after
the
money.
You

get
me,
John?
Yep,
that's
my
plan.
What
makes
you
think
I
won't
put
a
bullet
-
Cos
you're
scared
of
me.
Otherwise
she'd
be
dead
already.
Stop

Hands

open.
Eccoti

stronzo.
Move

of
that,
Nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
I
told
them

could
happen
Did
I
get
a
thank-you?
-
You
got
their
attention
now,
don't
you?
-
I
am
doing
the
country
a
favour.
Better
me
than
some
outsider.
Nobody
wants
to
see
that
happen.
Everything
I've
broken
can
be
fixed
Ah,
bullshit.
What?
I
shouldn't
get
paid
for
my
work?
Well,

that.
-
Thanks
for
all
your
help,
John.
Is
he
OK?
-
Should
I
put
my
hands
up?
Put
'em
down
further?
Might
die
of
shock
on
the
way
to
the
hospital.
All
right.

I'll
be
right
back.
-
Hey.
-
How's
it
feel
to
be
shot?
He
gave
me
some...
-
Well,
you
got
your
merit
badge
now.
-
Plus,
you
know,
chicks
dig
scars.
Not
that
one.
-
What?
How
did
you
know
what
I
was
thinking?
-
I
felt
like
we
had
kind
of
a
vibe.
Yeah.
Besides,
after
all
we've
been
through,
That
would
suck.
-
Good
to
go?
Take
care
of
yourself.
Hey.

Thanks
for
saving
my
daughter's
life.
What
was
I

That's
what
makes
you
that
guy.
Yeah.
So,

anything
about
me?
