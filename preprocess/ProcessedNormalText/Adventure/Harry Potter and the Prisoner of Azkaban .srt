Harry.
Harry,
open
the
door.
Marge.
How
lovely
to
see...
Uncle
Vernon,
What
is
it?
Nothing.
School
stuff.
Later
perhaps,
if
you
behave.
I
will
if
she
does.
-
Oh,
you're
still
here,
are
you?
Don't
say
yes
Damn
good
of
my
brother
He'd
have
been
straight
to
an
orphanage
Is
that
my
Dudders?
Give
us
a
kiss.
Come
on.
Up,
up.
Take
Marge's
suitcase
upstairs.
Okay.
Finish
that
off
for
Mommy.
-
Can
I
tempt
you,
Marge?
Excellent
nosh,
Petunia.
A
bit
more.
Usually
just
a
fry-up
for
me,
Just
a
bit
more.
That's
a
boy.
You
wanna
try
A
little
drop
of
brandy-brandy
What
are
you
smirking
at?
Where
did
you
send
the
boy,
St.
Brutus'.
It's
a
fine
Do
they
use
a
cane
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
I've
been
beaten
Excellent.
I
won't
have
this
...wishy-washy
nonsense
about
You
mustn't
blame
yourself
It's
all
to
do
with
blood.
What
is
it
the
boy's
father
did,
Nothing.
He
didn't
work.
-
And
a
drunk
too,
no
doubt?
-
What
did
you
say?
Don't
worry.
Don't
fuss,
Petunia.
I
think
it's
time
you
went
to
bed.
Quiet,
Vernon.
You,
clean
it
up.
Actually,
it's
nothing
to
do
It's
all
to
do
with
the
mother.
If
something's
wrong
with
the
bitch,
Shut
up!
Shut
up!
Right.
Let
me
tell
you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon,
do
something!
Stop!
I've
got
you,
Marge.
-
Hold
on,
hold
on.
-
Don't
you
dare!
Oh,
Vernon.
Oh,
God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come
back!
You
bring
her
back!
-
You
put
her
right!
-
Keep
away
from
me.
-
Yeah?
Try
me.
You've
nowhere
to
go.
I
don't
care.
"Welcome
to
the
Knight
Bus...
...emergency
transport
My
name
is
Stan
Shunpike,
and
I
will
be
What
you
doing
down
there?
-
I
fell
over.
-
I
didn't
do
it
on
purpose.
Let's
not
wait
for
the
grass
to
grow.
-
What
you
looking
at?
Well,
come
on,
then.
In.
No,
no,
no.
I'll
get
this.
You
get
in.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Move
on,
move
on.
-
Take
her
away,
Ern.
It's
going
to
be
a
bumpy
ride.
-
What
did
you
say
your
name
was?
-
Whereabouts
are
you
headed?
You
hear
that?
"The
Leaky
Cauldron.
The
Leaky
Cauldron.

sure
you
eat
it

But
the
Muggles.
Can't
they
see
us?
They
don't
see
nothing,
do
they?
No,
but
if
you
jab
them

little
old
lady

o'clock!
Ten,
nine,
eight...
...seven,
six,
five...
...four,
three,
three
and
a
half...
...two,
one
and
three
quarters.
Yes!
Who
is
that?
That
man.
Who
is
that?
Who
is...?
That
is
Sirius
Black,
that
is.
Don't
tell
me
you've
never
He's
a
murderer.
Got
himself
locked
up
-
How
did
he
escape?
He's
the
first
one
that
done
it.
He
was
a
big
supporter
of...
...You-Know-Who.
I
reckon
you've
heard
of
him.
Yeah.
Him
I've
heard
of.
Ernie,
two
double-deckers
They're
getting
closer,
Ernie.
Ernie,
they're
right
on
top
of
us!
Mind
your
head.
Hey,
guys?
Guys?
Why
the
long
faces?
Yeah,
yeah.
-
The
Leaky
Cauldron.
Mr.
Potter,
at
last.
-
Take
it
away,
Ern.

Right
smart
bird
He
arrived
here
just
As
Minister
for
Magic,
it
is
my
duty
...earlier
this
evening
...a
little
south
of
Sheffield,
The
Accidental
Magic
Reversal
She
has
been
properly
punctured
She
will
have
no
recollection
So
that's
that...
...and
no
harm
done.
Pea
soup?
No,
thank
you.
-
Minister?
-
I
don't
understand.
I
broke
the
law.
Underage
wizards
Come
now.
The
Ministry
...for
blowing
up
their
aunts.
On
the
other
hand,
running
away
...was
very,
very
irresponsible.
-
"The
state
of
things,"
sir?
Sirius
Black,
you
mean?
But
what's
he
got
to
do
with
me?
Nothing,
of
course.
You're
safe.
And
tomorrow
you'll
be
These
are
your
new
schoolbooks.
...of
having
them
brought
here.
Hedwig.
Oh,
by
the
way,
Harry.
Whilst
you're
...wander.
Right!
You
gonna
move
Housekeeping.
I'll
come
back
later.
I'm
warning
you,
Hermione.
Keep
that
beast
away
from
Scabbers,
It's
a
cat,
Ronald.
-
It's
in
his
nature.
-
Looks
like
a
pig
with
hair.
...coming
from
the
owner
Crookshanks,
just
ignore
Harry.
Harry.
-
Egypt.
What's
it
like?
...like
mummies,
tombs,
-
Egyptians
used
to
worship
cats.
-
Not
flashing
that
clipping
again?
No,
not
a
soul.
-
The
day
maid.
-
Cook.
-
Harry.
-
Good
to
see
you,
dear.
-
Got
everything?
-
Yes?
All
your
books?
-
Your
clothes?
-
Good
boy.
-
Harry
Potter.
-
Harry,
wonder
if
I
might
have
a
word?
-
Hermione.
-
Looking
forward
to
a
new
term?
Harry,
some
within
the
Ministry
...from
divulging
what
I'm
about
But
I
think
that
you
need
You
are
in
danger.
Grave
danger.
Has
this
anything
to
do
What
do
you
know
-
Only
that
he's
escaped
from
Azkaban.
Thirteen
years
ago,
-
Voldemort.
Sorry.
When
you
stopped
You-Know-Who...
...Black
lost
everything.
But
to
this
day,
he
still
remains
And
in
his
mind...
...you
are
the
only
thing
...of
You-Know-Who
And
that
is
why...
...he
has
escaped
from
Azkaban.
To
find
you.
And
kill
me.
Harry,
swear
to
me
...you
won't
go
looking
for
Black.
Mr.
Weasley...
...why
would
I
go
looking
Quick.
Quick.
Ron,
Ron!
Oh,
for
goodness'
sake!
Don't
lose
him!
I
didn't
mean
to
blow
her
up.
I
just...
-
I
lost
control.
Honestly,
Ron,
it's
not
funny.
I
was
lucky
not
to
be
arrested.
I
still
think
it
was
brilliant.
Come
on.
Everywhere
else
is
full.
Who
do
you
think
that
is?
-
Professor
R.J.
Lupin.
How
is
it
she
knows
everything?
-
It's
on
his
suitcase,
Ronald.
-
Do
you
think
he's
really
asleep?
I
gotta
tell
you
something.
Let
me
get
this
straight.
...to
come
after
you?
But
they'll
catch
Black,
won't
they?
-
I
mean,
everyone's
looking
for
him.
Except
no
one's
ever
broken
out
...and
he's
a
murderous,
raving
lunatic.
Why
are
we
stopping?
We
can't
be
there
yet.
What's
going
on?
I
don't
know.
Ouch,
Ron.
That
was
my
foot.
There's
something
moving
out
there.
I
think
someone's
coming
aboard.
Bloody
hell!
What's
happening?
Harry.
Harry,
are
you
all
right?
Thank
you.
Here,
eat
this.
It'll
help.
It's
all
right.
It's
chocolate.
What
was
that
thing
that
came?
It
was
a
dementor.
One
of
the
guards
It
was
searching
the
train
If
you'll
excuse
me,
I
need
to
have
Eat.
You'll
feel
better.
What
happened
to
me?
Well,
you
sort
of
went
rigid.
We
thought
maybe
you
were
And
did
either
of
you
two...
...you
know...
...pass
out?
I
felt
weird,
though.
Like
I'd
never
be
cheerful
again.
But
someone
was
screaming.
A
woman.
No
one
was
screaming,
Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome
to
another
year
Now,
I'd
like
to
say
a
few
words...
...before
we
all
become
too
befuddled
First,
I'm
pleased
to
welcome
...who's
kindly
consented
...of
Defense
Against
Good
luck,
professor.
Of
course.
That's
why
he
knew
Potter.
Is
it
true
you
fainted?
-
I
mean,
you
actually
fainted?
-
How
did
he
find
out?
Our
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
...has
decided
to
retire...
...in
order
to
spend
more
time
Fortunately,
...that
his
place
will
be
taken
...than
our
own
Rubeus
Hagrid.
Finally,
on
a
more
disquieting
note...
...at
the
request
...Hogwarts
will,
until
further
notice,
...until
such
a
time
The
dementors
will
be
stationed
Now
whilst
I've
been
assured...
...that
their
presence
will
not
disrupt
...a
word
of
caution.
Dementors
are
vicious
creatures.
...between
the
one
they
hunt
Therefore,
I
must
warn
...to
give
them
no
reason
It
is
not
in
the
nature
But
you
know,
...even
in
the
darkest
of
times...
...if
one
only
remembers
Fortuna
Major.
Here,
listen.
-
Fortuna
Major.
Watch
this.
-
Amazing.
Just
with
my
voice.
-
Yes,
all
right.
Go
in.
Still
doing
that
after
three
years.
-
She
can't
even
sing.
-
Hey,
man.
-
Oh,
God.
Green.
That's
a
monkey.
-
What
is
that?
Do
not
give
him
one
again.
Hey,
Neville,
try
an
elephant.
-
Ron,
catch.
I
think
we
have
a
winner.
-
Oh,
don't
try
one
of
them.
Look
at
him.
His
face.
Welcome,
my
children.
In
this
room,
you
shall
explore
In
this
room,
you
shall
discover
Hello.
I
am
Professor
Trelawney.
Together
we
shall
cast
ourselves
This
term,
we'll
focus
on
Tasseomancy,
So
please,
take
the
cup
What
do
you
see?
The
truth
lies
buried
like
a
sentence
But
first,
you
must
broaden
-
First,
you
must
look
beyond.
-
Where
did
you
come
from?
-
I've
been
here
all
this
time.
Is
your
grandmother
quite
well?
I
think
so.
I
wouldn't
be
so
sure
of
that.
Pity.
Broaden
your
minds.
Your
aura
is
pulsing,
dear.
-
I
think
you
are.
Look
at
the
cup.
Yeah.
Harry's
got
sort
of
a
wonky
cross.
And
that
there
could
be
the
sun
So...
...you're
gonna
suffer,
Give
me
the
cup.
Oh,
my
dear
boy.
My
dear...
...you
have
the
Grim.
The
Grin?
What's
the
Grin?
Not
the
Grin,
you
idiot.
The
Grim.
"Taking
form
of
a
giant
spectral
dog.
It's
among
the
darkest
omens
It's
an
omen...
...of
death."
You
don't
think
that
Grim
thing's
Oh,
honestly,
Ron.
If
you
ask
me,
Now,
Ancient
Runes,
Ancient
Runes?
Exactly
how
many
A
fair
few.
Hang
on.
That's
not
possible.
Ancient
Runes
is
in
the
You
have
to
be
in
two
Don't
be
silly.
How
could
anyone
"Broaden
your
minds.
Use
your
That's
it.
Come
on,
now.
Come
closer.
I
got
a
real
treat
for
you
today.
A
great
lesson.
So
follow
me.
Right,
you
lot.
Less
chattering.
And
open
your
books
to
page
49.
Exactly
how
do
we
do
that?
Just
stroke
the
spine,
of
course.
-
Don't
be
such
a
wimp,
Longbottom.
-
I
think
they're
funny.
Witty.
God,
this
place
Wait
until
Father
hears
Dumbledore's
Shut
up,
Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
-
Just
ignore
him.
Yeah.
Isn't
he
beautiful?
Say
hello
to
Buckbeak.
Hagrid,
exactly
what
is
that?
That,
Ron,
is
a
hippogriff.
First
thing
you
wanna
know
Very
easily
offended.
It
may
be
the
last
thing
you
ever
do.
Now,
who'd
like
to
come
Well
done,
Harry.
Well
done.
Come
on
now.
Now...
...you
have
to
let
him
make
the
first
...step
up.
Give
him
a
nice
bow.
Then
you
wait
If
he
does,
you
can
go
and
touch
him.
If
not...
Well,
Just
make
your
bow.
Nice
and
low.
Back
off,
Harry.
Back
off.
Keep
still.
Keep
still.
Well
done,
Harry.
Well
done.
Right.
I
think
you
can
go
Go
on.
Don't
be
shy.
Nice
and
slow,
now.
Not
so
fast,
Harry.
Slow
down,
Harry.
That's
it...
Nice
and
slow.
Slowly,
now,
slowly,
slowly...
That's
it...
Yes!
Well
done!
Well
done,
Harry,
Does
he
get
to
fly?
-
I
think
he
may
let
you
ride
him
now.
-
Come
on.
Put
you
over
here,
Don't
pull
out
any
of
his
feathers,
Well
done,
Harry,
and
well
done,
That
was
wicked,
Harry!
Oh,
please.
Well
done,
well
done.
-
How
am
I
doing
me
first
day?
You're
not
dangerous
at
all,
are
you,
Malfoy,
no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away,
you
silly
creature...
-
It's
killed
me!
Hagrid!
-
He
has
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital.
-
You're
gonna
regret
this.
You
and
your
bloody
chicken!
Does
it
hurt
terribly,
Draco?
It
comes
and
it
goes.
Madam
Pomfrey
said
another
minute
-
I
can't
do
homework
for
weeks.
-
He's
really
laying
it
on
thick,
isn't
he?
I
hear
Draco's
father's
furious.
-
He's
been
sighted!
Sirius
Black!
Dufftown?
That's
not
far
from
here.
You
don't
think
he'd
come
-
With
dementors
at
every
entrance?
He
slipped
past
them
once.
That's
right.
Black
could
be
anywhere.
Like
trying
to
catch
smoke
Intriguing,
isn't
it?
Would
anyone
like
to
venture
...as
to
what
is
inside?
-
That's
a
boggart,
that
is.
Now,
can
anybody
tell
me
-
No
one
knows.
Boggarts
are
shape-shifters.
They
take
the
shape
of
whatever
-
That's
what
makes
them
so...
Luckily,
a
very
simple
charm
exists
Let's
practice
it
now.
After
me.
Riddikulus!
-
Riddikulus!
A
little
louder
and
very
clear.
-
This
class
is
ridiculous.
So
much
for
the
easy
part.
You
see,
What
really
finishes
a
boggart
You
need
to
force
it
to
assume
Let
me
explain.
Neville,
Come
on,
don't
be
shy.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Hello.
Neville,
what
frightens
you
Professor
Snape.
-
Sorry?
Professor
Snape.
Yes,
frightens
all.
-
You
live
with
your
grandmother.
No...
...it
won't.
I
want
you
Only
her
clothes,
very
clearly,
-
She
carries
a
red
handbag...
As
long
as
you
see
it,
we'll
see
it.
...here's
what
I
want
Imagine
Professor
Snape
Can
you
do
that?
Yes.
Wand
at
the
ready.
One,
two,
three.
Think,
Neville,
think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful,
Neville,
wonderful!
...to
the
back,
Neville.
Form
a
line!
I
want
everyone
to
picture
the
thing
...and
turn
it
into
something
funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face
your
fear.
Wand
at
the
ready,
Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You
see?
Very
good,
very
good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely,
very,
very
Show
us
what
you
see.
Keep
your
nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And
next!
Step
up,
step
up!
Wonderful,
wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry
about
that.
Collect
your
books
from
the
back.
That's
the
end
of
the
lesson.
Sorry,
you
can
have
too
much
Remember,
these
visits
to
Hogsmeade
Should
your
behavior
reflect
poorly
...that
privilege
shall
not
No
permission
form
signed,
That's
the
rule,
Potter.
Those
with
permission,
follow
me.
I
thought
if
you
signed
it,
I
can't.
Only
a
parent
Since
I
am
neither,
I'm
sorry,
Potter.
Forget
about
it,
guys.
See
you
later.
Professor,
can
I
ask
you
something?
You
want
to
know
why
I
stopped
you
I
thought
it'd
be
obvious.
I
assumed
it
would
take
the
shape
I
did
think
of
Voldemort
at
first.
But
then
I
remembered
that
night
...and
the
dementor.
That
suggests
what
you
fear
the
most
This
is
very
wise.
Before
I
fainted...
...I
heard
something.
A
woman...
...screaming.
Dementors
force
us
to
relive
Our
pain
becomes
their
power.
I
think
it
was
my
mother...
...the
night
she
was
murdered.
The
very
first
time
I
saw
you,
Harry,
Not
by
your
scar,
by
your
eyes.
They're
your
mother,
Lily's.
Yes.
Oh,
yes.
I
knew
her.
Your
mother
was
there
for
me
Not
only
was
she
...she
was
also
She
had
a
way
of
seeing
...even,
and
most
especially,
when
that
And
your
father,
James,
...he...
He
had
a
certain,
shall
we
say,
A
talent,
rumor
has
it,
You're
more
like
them
In
time,
you'll
come
to
see
Honeyduke's
Sweetshop
is
brilliant,
We
never
got
to
go
-
You
heard
it's
the
most...
What's
going
on?
Probably
Neville
forgot
-
Hey.
Let
me
through,
please.
Get
back,
all
of
you.
No
one
is
to
enter
this
dormitory
The
Fat
Lady!
She's
gone!
Serves
her
right.
It's
not
funny,
Ron.
Keep
calm,
everyone.
Break
into
fours.
-
Be
quiet.
-
The
headmaster's
here.
You
heard.
Move!
Mr.
Filch?
Round
up
the
ghosts.
Tell
them
to
search
every
painting
There's
no
need
for
ghosts,
professor.
The
Fat
Lady's
there.
Mind
where
you're
going!
Slow
down!
You
listen!
I'm
Head
Boy!
-
Come
back
here!
Dear
lady,
who
did
this
to
you?
Eyes
like
the
devil,
he's
got,
It's
him,
headmaster.
He's
here,
somewhere
in
the
castle!
Sirius
Black!
Secure
the
castle,
Mr.
Filch.
I've
searched
the
Astronomy
Tower
-
Thank
you.
-
Very
good.
No
sign
of
Black,
nor
anywhere
else
I
didn't
really
expect
him
to
linger.
Remarkable
feat,
don't
you
think?
To
enter
Hogwarts
Castle
...completely
undetected?
Any
theories
on
how
Many.
Each
as
unlikely
as
the
next.
You
may
recall...
...prior
to
the
start
of
term
...about
your
appointment
Not
a
single
professor
inside
this
castle
I'm
quite
convinced
the
castle
is
safe...
...and
I'm
more
than
willing
to
send
What
about
Potter?
Perhaps.
But
for
now,
let
him
sleep.
For
in
dreams,
we
enter
a
world
Let
them
swim
in
the
deepest
ocean
Turn

Excuse
me,
sir.
That's
not
really
your
concern,
Suffice
it
to
say
your
professor
...at
the
present
time.
"Werewolves"?
Sir,
we
just
learned
about
red
caps
-
We're
not
meant
to
start
that
for
weeks.
When
did
she
come
in?
Now,
which
one
of
you
...between
an
Animagus
No
one?
-
How
disappointing.
An
Animagus
is
a
wizard
A
werewolf
has
no
choice.
With
each
full
moon...
...he
no
longer
remembers
who
he
is.
The
werewolf
only
responds
Thank
you,
Mr.
Malfoy.
...you've
spoken
out
of
turn,
Are
you
incapable
...or
do
you
take
pride
-
He's
got
a
point,
you
know.
As
an
antidote
to
your
ignorance,
...two
rolls
of
parchment
...on
recognizing
it.
Then
I
suggest
you
take
extra
care,
Loss
of
limb
will
not
excuse
you.

The
term
"werewolf"...
...is
a
contraction
...which
means
"man,"
and
"wolf."
There
are
several
ways
They
include
being
given
the
power
...being
bitten
by
a
werewolf...
Go,
Harry!
Go,
Harry!
Aresto
momentum!
-
He
looks
a
bit
peaky,
doesn't
he?
What
do
you
expect?
Let's
walk
you
off
a
tower
Probably
a
right
sight
better
-
How
are
you
feeling?
You
gave
us
a
right
good
scare.
-
What
happened?
Really?
I
meant
the
match.
Who
won?
No
one
blames
you,
Harry.
Dementors
aren't
supposed
to
be
After
he
saved
you,
There's
something
else
When
you
fell,
your
broom
sort
of
blew
Well...
I'm
sorry
to
hear
Is
there
no
chance
of
fixing
it?
No.
Professor,
why
do
the
dementors
-
I
mean,
more
than
everyone
else?
Dementors
are
the
foulest
creatures
They
feed
on
every
good
feeling,
...until
a
person
is
left
with
absolutely
You
are
not
weak,
Harry.
Dementors
affect
you
most
because
Horrors
your
classmates
You
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of.
-
I'm
scared,
professor.
I
need
to
know
how
to
fight
them.
You
made
the
one
There
was
only
one
that
night.
-
But
you
made
it
go
away.
But
as
the
dementors
seem
...perhaps
I
should
teach
you.
For
now,
I
need
to
rest.
Last
call
for
Hogsmeade!
-
Guys,
let
me
go.
-
But
not
clever
enough.
-
I'm
trying
to
get
to
Hogsmeade.
We'll
get
you
there.
-
We'll
show
you
a
quicker
way.
-
Bless
him.
-
Now,
Harry.
What
are
you
doing?!
-
What's
this
rubbish?
-
It's
the
secret
to
our
success.
But
we've
decided
George,
if
you
will.
I
solemnly
swear
"Messrs.
Moony,
Wormtail,
Padfoot
...are
proud
to
present
We
owe
them
so
much.
Hang
on.
This
is
Hogwarts.
-
No.
Is
that
really...?
-
In
his
study.
Does
that
a
lot.
-
So
this
map
shows...?
-
Where
they
are.
-
Every
minute.
-
Brilliant!
Where
did
you
get
it?
-
First
year.
...out
of
the
castle.
-
The
One-Eyed
Witch
passageway.
Hurry.
Filch
is
heading
this
way.
And
don't
forget.
When
you're
done,
Now,
how
much
do
you
want?
Delicious.
It's
meant
to
be
the
most
haunted
Twice.
Do
you
want
to
move
a
bit
closer?
To
the
Shrieking
Shack?
Actually,
I'm
fine
here.
Well,
well.
Look
who's
here.
You
two
shopping
for
your
new
Bit
grand
for
you,
isn't
it,
Weasle-Bee?
-
Shut
your
mouth,
Malfoy.
Boys,
I
think
it's
time
we
teach
-
Hope
you
don't
mean
yourself.
You
filthy
little
mudblood!
Who
is
that?
-
Don't
stand
there!
Do
something!
What's
up,
Malfoy?
Lost
your
skis?
Get
out
of
the
way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody
hell,
Harry.
Those
weasels!
Never
told
me
He
won't
keep
it.
He'll
turn
it
over
-
Aren't
you?
Look
who
it
is.
Madam
Rosmerta.
-
Ron
fancies
her.
-
Professor
McGonagall!
Allow
me,
minister.
-
Oh,
Hagrid...
Rosmerta,
my
dear.
It'd
be
a
lot
better
if

Ministry
