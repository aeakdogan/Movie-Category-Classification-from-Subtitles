I
stiII
don't
know
why
I'm
here.
Yes,
I
couId,
but
it's
not
my
way.
And
I
wouId
expect
you,
of
aII
peopIe,
wouId
Ah,
power
corrupts
and
aII
that.
-
When
are
you
going
to
stop
Iecturing
me?
You're
here
because
I
need
you.
We
don't
have
to
meet
No.
This
one's
speciaI.
What
a
beautifuI
campus.
Yeah,
the
brochure
is
great.
But
what
about
Jean?
-
IIIness?
You
think
your
daughter
is
sick,
Mr.
Grey?
Perhaps
it
wouId
be
best
Of
course.
Jean,
can
you
come
down,
dear?
We'II
Ieave
you,
then.
It's
very
rude
to
read
my
thoughts,
Did
you
think
you
were
We're
mutants,
Jean.
We're
Iike
you.
ReaIIy?
I
doubt
that.
Oh,
CharIes.
I
Iike
this
one.
You
have
more
power
The
question
is,
wiII
you
controI
that
power?
Or
Iet
it
controI
you?
Warren?
Son,
is
everything
aII
right?
-
What's
going
on?
Come
on.
Open
the
door.
Warren.
One
second!
Open
this
door.
Warren.
Let
me
in
there
right
now.
Open
the
door.
Oh,
God.
-
Not
you.
-
Not
you.
The
whoIe
worId's
going
to
heII
Bobby!
Thanks,
Kitty.
-
We're
getting
kiIIed
out
here.
-
Logan.
That
was
my
Iast
cigar.
Logan.
-
It's
getting
cIoser.
Hey,
Tin
Man.
Come
here.
-
How's
your
throwing
arm?
Yeah.
Good
Iuck
with
that.
Throw
me.
Now.
Dammit,
Logan,
don't
do
this.
CIass
dismissed.
Hey,
CoIossus.
Nice
throw.
SimuIation
compIete.
-
What
was
that?
-
You
know
what
I
mean.
You
can't
change
the
ruIes.
-
I
taught
'em
something.
Yeah,
best
defense
is
a
good
offence.
-
This
isn't
a
game,
Logan.
Hey,
I'm
just
a
sub.
-
Scott!
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
-
Are
you
OK?
You
seem
Iike
you're
avoiding
me.
I
can't
touch
my
boyfriend
without
Hey.
I
don't
think
that's
fair.
You're
a
guy,
Bobby.
-
They
were
Iooking
for
you.
You
didn't
show.
-
For
starters,
I
had
to
cover
your
ass.
No,
you
didn't.
The
professor
did.
-
I
was
just
passing
through.
Hey,
Iook.
-
I
know
how
you
feeI.
When
Jean
died...
Maybe
it's
time
for
us
to
move
on.
Not
everybody
heaIs
as
fast
as
you,
Logan.
-
Mr.
Secretary.
-
The
meeting's
begun,
sir.
Mr.
President.
Have
a
seat,
Hank.
HomeIand
Security
was
tracking
Magneto.
We
got
hits
in
Lisbon,
Geneva,
MontreaI.
NAVSAT
Iost
him
crossing
the
border,
We
picked
her
up
breaking
into
the
FDA.
You
know
who
she's
been
imitating?
Yes,
sir.
She
can
do
that.
-
Not
any
more,
she
can't.
We
got
her.
We
have
some
new
prisons.
Where
is
Magneto?
Raven?
-
Raven,
I
asked
you
a
question.
Raven
DarkhoIme.
Or
has
he
convinced
you
My
famiIy
tried
to
kiII
me,
OK,
then.
Mystique
-
where
is
he?
In
here
with
us.
I
don't
want
to
pIay
games
with
you.
You
don't
want
to
pIay
games
with
me?
You
are
going
to
stop
this.
You
wanna
know
where
he
is?
Homo
sapien.
You
know,
her
capture
but
having
her
does
give
us
On
principIe,
I
can't
negotiate
-
I
thought
that's
why
you
appointed
me,
sir.
-
But
that's
not
why
you
caIIed
me
here.
It's
what
she
stoIe
from
the
FDA.
Dear
Lord.
-
Is
it
viabIe?
You
reaIize
the
impact
Yes.
I
do.
That's
preciseIy
why
When
an
individuaI
acquires
great
power,
the
use
or
misuse
of
that
power
is
everything.
WiII
it
be
for
the
greater
good
or
wiII
it
Now,
this
is
a
question
Why?
Because
we
are
mutants.
For
psychics,
When
is
it
acceptabIe
to
use
our
power
that
turns
us
into
tyrants
But
Einstein
said
that
ethics
without
any
superhuman
authority
behind
it.
Einstein
wasn't
a
mutant
so
far
as
we
know.
This
case
study
was
sent
to
me
The
man
you
see
here
was
born
His
organs
and
nervous
system
work,
What
if
we
were
to
transfer
say
a
father
of
four
with
terminaI
cancer,
into
the
body
of
this
man?
How
are
we
to
decide
what
faIIs
within
Professor?
We'II
continue
this
tomorrow.
The
forecast
was
for
sunny
skies.
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
have
to
be
psychic
I
don't
understand.
Magneto's
a
fugitive,
we've
a
mutant
in
the
cabinet,
We're
not
hiding.
But
we
stiII
have
enemies.
Yes,
but
we
can't
be
students
forever.
Storm,
I
haven't
thought
of
you
In
fact,
I
thought
that
perhaps
-
But
Scott's...
He
took
Jean's
death
so
hard.
Yes,
things
are
better
out
there,
but
you,
of
aII
peopIe,
There's
something
you're
not
teIIing
us.
Hank?
Ororo.
CharIes.
I
Iove
what
you've
done
with
your
hair.
You
too.
Thank
you
for
seeing
me
Henry,
you
are
aIways
weIcome
here.
-
I
have
news.
No.
Though
we
have
been
making
-
Mystique
was
recentIy
apprehended.
Hank
McCoy.
Secretary
of
Mutant
Affairs.
Right,
right.
The
secretary.
Nice
suit.
-
Henry,
this
is
Logan.
He's...
-
I
hear
you're
quite
an
animaI.
Magneto's
gonna
come
get
Mystique.
Magneto's
not
the
probIem.
A
major
pharmaceuticaI
company
A
way
to
suppress
the
mutant
X
gene.
-
Suppress?
They're
caIIing
it
a
cure.
That's
ridicuIous.
-
ScientificaIIy
speaking...
Storm.
They're
announcing
it
now.
These
so-caIIed
mutants
Their
affIiction
is
nothing
more
a
corruption
of
heaIthy
ceIIuIar
activity.
But
I
stand
here
today
This
site,
once
the
worId's
wiII
now
be
the
source
of
freedom
Ladies
and
gentIemen...
I
proudIy
present
the
answer
to
mutation.
FinaIIy,
we
have
a
cure.
Who
wouId
want
this
cure?
I
mean,
what
Is
it
cowardice
to
save
oneseIf
Not
aII
of
us
can
fit
in
so
easiIy.
-
You
don't
shed
on
the
furniture.
-
The
government
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
My
boy,
I
have
been
fighting
for
mutant
rights
-
Did
he
just
caII
me
boy?
Yes,
Rogue.
It
appears
to
be
true.
No.
Professor.
They
can't
cure
us.
You
wanna
know
why?
Because
there's
Or
any
of
us,
for
that
matter.
How
shouId
we,
as
mutants,
respond?
This
is
about
getting
organized.
We
need
to
put
together
a
committee
They
don't
understand.
They
don't
know
We
need
to
show
them,
educate
them,
PeopIe,
you
must
Iisten.
-
They
wanna
exterminate
us.
Nobody
is
taIking
about
extermination.
No
one
ever
taIks
about
it.
They
just
do
it.
And
you'II
go
on
with
your
Iives
And
then
one
day,
when
the
air
is
stiII
Then
you
reaIize,
whiIe
you're
taIking
the
extermination
has
aIready
begun.
Make
no
mistake,
my
brothers.
They
wiII
force
their
cure
upon
us.
The
onIy
question
is,
Or
wait
for
the
inevitabIe
genocide?
Who
wiII
you
stand
with?
The
humans?
Or
us?
You
taIk
pretty
tough
for
a
guy
in
a
cape.
Back
off.
If
you're
so
proud
of
being
a
mutant,
I
have
been
marked
once,
my
dear.
No
needIe
shaII
ever
touch
my
skin
again.
You
know
who
you're
taIking
to?
Do
you?
And
what
can
you
do?
So
you
have
taIents?
That
and
more.
I
know
you
controI
metaI.
And
I
know
there's
87
mutants
in
here,
Other
than
you
two.
You
can
sense
other
mutants
CouId
you
Iocate
one
for
me?
Let
me
out
of
here.
Do
you
know
who
I
am?
Oh,
Mr.
President.
Shut
up.
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
Let
me
down.
PIease.
Keep
it
up.
I'II
spray
you
in
the
face,
bitch.
When
I
get
out
of
here,
Yeah,
right.
Secretary
McCoy,
Thank
you,
Dr.
Rao.
It's
the
safest
Iocation
we
couId
find.
That's
He
is
a
mutant.
You
understand
our
concern.
-
We
are
in
compIiance
with
your
poIicy.
UntiI
we
can
fuIIy
map
his
DNA.
And
his
power?
What
is
its
range?
You'II
see.
Jimmy.
There's
someone
I
wouId
Iike
you
to
meet.
HeIIo
there,
son.
-
Hi.
I'm
sorry.
It's
OK.
You
have
an
amazing
gift.
Thank
you,
Jimmy.
Extraordinary,
isn't
he?
Yes,
he
is.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
-
Can
you
hear
me?
I'm
stiII
here.
Scott.
-
I'm
here.
Scott.
Scott.
-
Scott.
Scott.
I
need
you,
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
Stop!
Jean?
Scott.
How?
I
don't
know.
I
wanna
see
your
eyes.
-
Take
these
off.
No.
Trust
me.
I
can
controI
it
now.
Open
them.
You
can't
hurt
me.
-
What
happened?
-
Professor,
are
you
OK?
-
You
don't
want
to
be
here.
I
can't
see
a
damn
thing.
I
can
take
care
of
that.
What
the...
Logan!
She's
aIive.
Jean.
The
sheer
mass
of
water
that
coIIapsed
The
onIy
expIanation
of
Jean's
survivaI
is
that

Is
she
gonna
be
OK?
Jean

Her

in

When
she
was
a

to

-
Jean
deveIoped
a

personaIity.
The

Jean,
whose
powers
were
A

that,
in
our
sessions,
A

She

Far

She

I'm

to

What
have
you
done
to
her?
-
You
have
to
understand...
-
She
has
to
be
controIIed.
Sometimes,
when
you
cage
the
beast,
You
have
no
idea.
No,
Professor.
I
had
a
terribIe
choice
to
make.
It
sounds
to
me
Iike
Jean
had
no
choice
at
aII.
I

WiII
Secretary

Hard
to
say.
His
poIiticaI
views
seem
Excuse
me,
sir.
Your
son's
arrived.
Good.
Bring
him
in.
Are
you
sure
you
want
to
start
with
him?
I
think
it's
important.
Yes.
-
HeIIo,
Warren.
-
Did
you
sIeep
weII?
You
know,
I'm
proud
of
you
for
doing
this.
Everything's
gonna
be
fine.
I
promise.
You
ready?
The
transformation
can
be
a
IittIe
jarring.
-
Dad,
can
we
taIk
about
this
for
a
second?
It'II

be
over
soon.
-
Everything's
going
to
be
fine.
Warren,
caIm
down.
-
I
can't

-
I
can't

I

Warren,
reIax.
Warren,
it's
a

-
It's
what
we
aII
want.
It's
what
you
want.
Warren,
no!
ToId
you
so.
About
time.
I've
been
busy.
The
source
of
the
cure
is
a
mutant.
Without
him,
they
have
nothing.
Read

At

I'm

''If

How

What

-
I
can't

Nice

I

he'II

No!
You

Eric.
I'm
sorry,
my

You're

Such
a

She

Think

The
decision
to
turn

into

What
happened
on
that
convoy
That
was
an
isoIated
incident.
You
have
to
Have
you
even
begun
to
think
I
have.
And
I
worry
about
how
democracy
survives
As
do
I.
You
and
I
know
AII
the
more
reason
Jean.
-
Hi,
Logan.
Back
where
we
first
met.
OnIy
I
was
Are
you
OK?
Yeah.
More
than
OK.
Logan,
you're
making
me
bIush.
-
You're
reading
my
thoughts?
It's
OK.
It's
OK.
-
Wait.
Jean.
-
This
isn't
you.
No.
Maybe
you
ought
to
take
it
easy.
The
professor
said
you
might
be
different.
He
wouId
know,
wouIdn't
he?
What?
You
think
he's
not
in
your
head
too?
Look
at
you,
Logan.
He's
tamed
you.
Where's
Scott?
Jean?
-
Where
am
I?
You
need
to
teII
me
what
happened
to
Scott.
Jean,
teII
me
what
happened
to
him.
Oh,
God.
Look
at
me.
Stay
with
me.
TaIk
to
me.
-
Look
at
me.
Look
at
me.
Focus.
Focus,
Jean.
KiII
me.
-
What?
-
Don't
say
that.
-
Stop
it.
Stop
it.
Look
at
me.
Look
at
me.
Jean.
It'II
be
aII
right.
We
can
heIp
you.
Hey.
The
professor
can
heIp.
He
can
fix
it.
I
don't
want
to
fix
it.
VoIuntary?
They
put
the
cure
in
a
gun.
I
toId
you
they
wouId
draw
first
bIood.
-
So
what
do
we
do?
We
use
this
weapon
as
a
Iightning
rod
Come.
We
have
an
army
to
buiId.
I
picked
something
up.
An
eIectromagnetic
force.
It's
massive.
It's
a
mutant.
CIass
five.
More
powerfuI
than
you.
Where
is
she?
Logan.
-
Jean.
Jean.
What
have
you
done?
-
I
think
she
kiIIed
Scott.
-
That's
not
possibIe.
She's
Ieft
the
mansion,
but
she's
trying
It
may
be
too
Iate.
-
Wait
for
me
here.
I
need
to
see
Jean
aIone.
You
were
right,
CharIes.
-
This
one
is
speciaI.
Same
as
the
professor.
Visiting
an
oId
friend.
-
I
don't
want
troubIe
here.
So,
shaII
we
go
inside?
I
came
to
bring
Jean
home.
Don't
interfere.
-
Just
Iike
oId
times,
eh?
Funny,
you
sound
just
Iike
her
parents.
Nobody
gets
inside.
-
I
knew
you'd
come.
-
I
have
no
home.
You
know
he
thinks
your
power
I
don't
beIieve
your
mind
games
-
So
you
want
to
controI
me?
No.
I
want
to
heIp
you.
HeIp
me?
What's
wrong
with
me?
-
AbsoIuteIy
nothing.
No,
CharIes,
not
this
time.
For
your
own
good,
Jean.
Stay
out
of
my
head.
-
I'm
going
in.
Look
at
me,
Jean.
I
can
heIp
you.
Look
at
me.
Get
out
of
my
head.
-
Perhaps
you
shouId
Iisten
to
her,
CharIes.
-
But
I
can
heIp
you.
Look
at
Scott.
You
kiIIed
the
man
you
Ioved
No!
Stop
it!
That's
it.
Jean,
Iet
me
in.
No,
Jean.
Jean!
Don't
Iet
it
controI
you.
CharIes.
My
dear.
Come
with
me.
No.
God!
We
Iive
in
an
age
of
darkness.
A
worId
fuII
of
fear,
hate
and
intoIerance.
But
in
every
age,
CharIes
Xavier
was
born
to
a
worId
divided.
A
worId
he
tried
to
heaI.
A
mission
he
never
saw
accompIished.
It
seems
the
destiny
of
great
men
CharIes
was
more
than
a
Ieader,
When
we
were
afraid,
he
gave
us
strength.
And
when
we
were
aIone,
he
gave
us
a
famiIy.
He
may
be
gone,
but
his
teachings
Wherever
we
may
go,
And
that's
a
vision
of
a
worId
united.
Kitty.
Bobby.
-
You
OK?
It's
just...
Xavier
came
to
my
house.
He
was
the
one
that
convinced
me
Yeah,
me
too.
-
We're
aII
feeIing
the
same
way,
you
know.
You
have
Rogue
and
I
have...
You
know,
I
just
miss
home.
The
first
snow
and
aII
that.
-
Kitty,
get
up.
Come
with
me.
Don't
worry.
We
won't
get
caught.
I
mean,
you
can
Come
on.
This
pIace
can
be
home
too.
Thank
you
for
this,
Bobby.
You
need
a
Iift,
kid?
No.
Where
are
you
going?
You
don't
know
what
it's
Iike
to
be
afraid
of
Yeah,
I
do.
I
want
to
be
abIe
to
touch
peopIe,
Logan.
A
hug.
A
handshake.
A
kiss.
I
hope
you're
not
doing
this
for
some
boy.
Look,
if
you
wanna
go,
then
go.
Just
be
sure
it's
what
you
want.
ShouIdn't
you
be
teIIing
me
to
stay?
To
go
upstairs
and
unpack?
I'm
not
your
father.
I'm
your
friend.
Just
think
about
what
I
said,
Rogue.
Marie.
Marie.
Remember
when
we
first
met?
Do
you
know
I
saw
the
next
stage
in
evoIution
And
I
thought
to
myseIf,
''Why
wouId
CharIes
I
can
manipuIate
the
metaI
in
this,
but
you,
you
can
do
anything.
Anything
you
can
think
of.
Jean.
Enough.
Enough.
You
sound
just
Iike
him.
Jean,
he
wanted
to
hoId
you
back.
-
What
do
you
want?
As
nature
intended.
That
cure
is
meant
for
aII
of
us.
And
that
fight
begins
now.
She
shouIdn't
be
here
with
us.
-
Her
power
is
compIeteIy
unstabIe.
-
And
you
trust
her?
She's
one
of
them.
I
stuck
with
you.
WouId
have
kiIIed
CharIes
Xavier
did
more
for
mutants
My
singIe
greatest
regret
So
what
now?
What
do
we
do?
Xavier
started
this
schooI.
-
We'II
teII
the
students
they're
going
home.
I
can't
beIieve
this.
I
can't
beIieve
I'm
sorry.
I
know
this
is
a
bad
time.
I
was
toId
that
this
was
It
was,
son.
And
it
stiII
is.
We'II
find
you
a
room.
Hank,
teII
aII
the
students
Rogue.
Hey,
Rogue.
-
Hey,
Pete.
Have
you
seen
Rogue?
Logan.
Logan.
-
Logan.
Logan.
Where
am
I?
Logan.
Logan.
Logan.
-
Logan.
Logan.
Logan.
Logan.
-
Where
are
you
going?
-
She's
gone,
Logan.
She's
not
coming
back.
She
kiIIed
the
professor.
It
wasn't
Jean.
Listen,
why
can't
you
see
the
truth?
-
Why
can't
you
just
Iet
her
go?
Because
you
Iove
her.
She
made
her
choice.
So
if
you're
with
us,
then
be
with
us.
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
Getting
the
cure
so
you
can
go
back
home
I'm
Iooking
for
someone.
Oh,
I
get
it.
Your
girIfriend.
I
figured
she'd
want
the
cure.
She's
pathetic.
Come
on,
Iceman.
Make
a
move.
Same
oId
Bobby.
StiII
afraid
of
a
fight.
Today's
attack
was
onIy
our
first
saIvo.
So
Iong
as
the
cure
exists,
our
war
wiII
rage.
Your
cities
wiII
not
be
safe.
Your
streets
And
to
my
feIIow
mutants,
Join
us
or
stay
out
of
our
way.
Enough
mutant
bIood
We're
trying
to
track
them,
sir.
-
We
cannot
Iet
him
do
this.
This
is
now
a
nationaI
security
matter.
I
want
troops
armed
with
cure
weapons
And
Trask,
you
have
to
find
Magneto
Magneto
wants
a
war.
We'II
give
him
one.
Let's
go.
Keep
it
moving.
Turn
in
your
oId
weapon.
Turn
in
aII
metaI.
Bayonets,
magazines,
dog
tags.
Pick
up
your
pIastic
weapons.
AbsoIuteIy
no
metaI.
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
We
don't
need
a
cure!
They
wish
to
cure
us.
The
cure
for
that
infirm,
imperfect
condition
They
have
their
weapons.
We
have
ours.
We
wiII
strike
with
a
vengeance
and
a
fury
And
if
any
mutants
stand
in
our
way,
We
shaII
go
to
AIcatraz
IsIand,
take
controI
of
the
cure,
and
destroy
its
source.
And
then
nothing
can
stop
us.
Jean.
I
know
the
smeII
of
your
adamantium
-
I
didn't
come
here
to
fight
you.
-
I
came
for
Jean.
-
She's
here
because
she
wants
to
be.
I
know
fuII
weII.
And
you
stood
there
and
Iet
him
die?
-
I'm
not
Ieaving
here
without
her.
OK.
Two
minutes
tiII
rendezvous,
Mr.
President.
We
have
a
sateIIite
feed
-
How
did
we
find
it?
HeII
hath

fury
Iike
a
woman
scorned.
Approaching
target
dead

Set
for
360-degree
incursion.
This
is
Team
Leader
to
Bravo
One.
OK,
send
them
in.
OK.
Freeze,
mutants!
OK.
I
give
up.
Sorry,
Mr.
Secretary,
it
was
a
decoy.
If
he's
not
there,
then
where
the
heII
is
he?
Worthington
Labs.
It
ends
where
it
began.
-
Are
you
sure
the
boy
is
stiII

So
how
are
we
supposed
to
get
there?
Leave
that
to
me.
Storm.
Storm.
What
are
you
doing
back
here?
I
need
heIp.
-
You

her.
-
Where
are
they?
-
You're
saying
you
saw
Magneto?
-
There
are
troops
stationed
on
that
isIand.
Let's
suit
up.
-
Hard
to
beIieve
this
once
fit
me.
-
Can
you
estimate
how
many
he
has?
-
His
powers
have
Iimits,
hers
do
not.
Yeah.
We're
outnumbered.
I'm
not
gonna
Iie
to
you.
But
we
Iost
Scott.
We
Iost
the
professor.
If
we
don't
fight
now,
I'm
not
gonna
Iet
that
happen.
Are
you?
Then
we
stand
together.
X-Men.
AII
of
us.
We're
in.
Let's
go.
-
They're
ready.
But
are
you
ready
to
do
what
you
need
to
do
Dad,
what's
going
on?
It's
an
earthquake.
We're
trapped.
CharIes
aIways
wanted
to
buiId
bridges.
My
God.
FaII
back!
Take
cover!
FaII
back!
The
boy's
in
the
southeast
corner
-
WeII,

In
chess,
the
pawns
go
first.
Humans
and
their
guns.
PIastic.
They've
Iearned.
That's
why
the
pawns
go
first.
Target
the
bridge.
Fire!
ArcIight,

your
shockwaves.
-
Oh,

What

Tanks?

Where

our
ground
troops?
Then
God

They're

Everybody

And

Traitors

Finish

Go

And

With
pIeasure.
HoId

Not

Kitty!
Come

Grow

Don't

I'm

Going

Yes,

Stay

Who's

Don't.
No.
Don't.
PIease,
don't

this.
Do

It's

Take

Get
out
of
the
way.
-
Let's
go,
Iet's
go.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We

Best

offence.
Bobby,

take
out
Go

Storm,
we're
gonna
need
some
cover.
Right.
You're

Bobby.
Maybe

You

This

Hey.
Make

ActuaIIy,
