You

Clear!


I

Yeah!

Toll
Road,

Trench?
Oh,

embarrassing.
Yeah,
it
sure
is.
CHRISTMAS:
What's
he
doing
here?
Saving
this
Chinese
billionaire.
Oh,
yeah?
That's
funny.
So
are
we.
Well,
then
we
have
a
scheduling
problem,
Cut
me
loose,
Frankenstein.
BARNEY:
Don't
get
nuts,
Gunner.
Do
it.

-
Where's
your
team?
I
need
a
weapon.
Something
big.
-
Yours.
My
big
weapon's
hangin'
right
where
it
is.
Is
this
it?
Yes,
it's
here.
BARNEY:
Caesar!
I
need
you
in
here.
Come
on,
Caesar.
You
got
a
backup.
If
I
don't
get
this
back,
In
your
dreams.
-
Trench,
we
got
a
way
out.
Let's
get
you
out
of
here,
pal.
Hey,
look.
I
hate
to
break
up
the
bromance.
Get
Moneybags
up.
A
"thank
you"
would
be
nice.
-
I
hate
owing
you.
Let's
go,
Yao.
-
Did
you
win?
Let's
go!

I'm
out!
Now
you
put
on
your
lucky

One
wet
wall
coming
up.
I
got
your

What?

CHRISTMAS:
I
got
your

Keep
movin'!
TOLL:

Why

Yeah,

Better

SPEAKING

You
order

This
is
gonna
be
a
piss-poor
ending.

That
loaded?
We
can
only
hope.


Sorry,
sir.
I
had
to
adjust
for
a
wind
shift.
No
problem.
Hit
the
last

Moving
out.
Over.
HALE:
Let's

Yeah!

Let's

Come

BARNEY:
Okay,

Cavalry's

you
got

Wake

Shit!
The

You're

BILLY:
Appreciate

BARNEY:

We'll

BILLY:
I

Go!
All
right,

Put

I
wanna
hear
it,

CHRISTMAS:
Faulty.
Would
you
believe?

Hydraulics?
Congratulations.

Hey,
can
we
talk
when
you're
not
too
busy?
Kid's
amazing.
Really.
So
am
I.
You're
just
used
to
me.

Get
the
client
ready.
What
is
going
on?
Looks
like
you're
taking
Parachute
good?
Parachute?
Why
you
got
a
parachute?
Can
you
believe
they
changed
Yeah,
but
it's
okay.
Fifteen
seconds.
Opening
the
hatch!
Yang,
get
Moneybags
home
safely.
So
when
are
you
coming
back?
Maybe
soon,
maybe
never.
Then
who
am
I
supposed
to
pick
on?
You
will
find
another
minority.
Yang.
Smile.

See
you
later,
alligator.


That's
real
Chinese
takeout.

Floor
it.
I'm
homesick.
You
got
it.

LACY:
Yes!
I
love
this
song!
Whoo!
Juliet.
Two.
Christmas,
my
friend.
Please
tell
me
you
ain't
Of
course
I
am.
Look
at
that
girl.
Who
wouldn't
marry
her?
She
cheated
on
you.
-
It
was
a
half-cheat.
The
other
side
of
a
half-truth.
-
The
facts
are
murky.
I
hate
to
break
this
to
you,
pal,
but
your
girlfriend
over
there
-
I
should
stab
you
in
the
heart.
Hi,
cheers.
You
know,
I
used
to
think
Black
is
too
colorful.
-
Hey,
babe.
-
Hey,
Barney.
Promise
next
time
not
to
keep
Cross
my
heart.
If
he
had
one.
Look
who's
lost
in
space.
Got
a
pen?
CHRISTMAS:
Hey.
You
got
anything
Matter
of
fact,
I
don't.
Einstein's
theory
of
special
relativity.
Only
I
made
it
better.
-

Believe
it
or
not,
before
Gunner
he
went
to
MIT,
had
a
Master's
degree
This
idiot
actually
had
a
brain,
Well,
what
happened?
He
quit
to
be
a
bouncer.
I
wanted
to
get
close
to
this
girl
Yeah,
I
can't
believe
she
dumped
you.
-
Wouldn't
you?


-
Can
we
talk
outside?
How
do
I
put
this?
Just
be
straight
up.
Honest.
I
feel,
uh...
I'm
not
sure
what
I
feel.
This
life,
it's
not
for
you,
is
it?
I
thought
it
was.
You
gave
me
a
chance
to
be
one
of
you,
And
you've
got
my
respect,
too.
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Well,
I'd
like
to
finish
out
the
month.
Then
I
wanna
go
meet
up
with
my
girlfriend.
Where's
she
from?
She's
French.
Believe
it
or
not,
I
met
her
in
Afghanistan.

That
comes
in
handy.
Yeah.
And
you'd
like
her.
You
know,
she's
the
kind
of
person
That's
why
I
took
this
job,
Now
I
can
afford
to
get
her
It's
one
of
those
things
that
just
feels
right.
You
know
when
you
can
be
with
someone
You
already
know
what
they're
thinking.
Sure.
I
don't
want
you
to
think
that
No,
listen.
I'd
be
doing
what
you're
doing.
Why
don't
you
freshen
up
that
beer?
All
right.

MAN:
Barney
Ross.
What
do
you
want
from
me,
Church?
Not
too
good
in
the
memory
category,
You
made
a
deal
with
me.
And
you
end
up
blowing
up
half
of
Vilena,
punching
holes
and
a
bowie
knife
even
if
he
was
a
dirtbag.
But
what
breaks
my
heart
is
that
you
stole
$5
million
from
me.
And
for
all
this
male
pattern
badness,
I
could've
put
you
in
the
deepest,
No
sunlight.
-
But
I
kept
you
out.
Because
I
knew
the
day
would
come
Today
is
that
day.
Keep
talking.
A
Chinese
plane
got
shot
down
near
a
hell-hole
called
Gasak.
Yeah?
Who
shot
it
down?
Take
a
guess.
Onboard
that
plane
is
a
safe
carrying
All
you
need
to
know
is
Now,
you're
gonna
go
in
there,
and
you're
gonna
get
the
contents
You're
gonna
bring
it
to
me.
It
should
be
a
walk
in
the
park
for
you.
And
then
we're
even.
We'll
get
to
that.
The
safe
in
that
plane
is
very
high-tech.
The
access
code
changes
You
use
the
wrong
code,
it
blows.
-
So
we
need
to
get
you
in...
"We."
Who's
we?
That's
none
of
your
business.
Let's
just
call
our
host
The
Corporation.
All
right?
I'm
sending
along
a
pro
who
specializes
in
this
type
of
situation.
A
woman.
That
usually
goes
along
Forget
it.
She
can
handle
herself.
But
let
me
be
clear.
If
anything
happens
to
her,
she
gets
hurt,
she
gets
roughed
up,
she
doesn't
come
back
in
exactly
you
and
your
little
gang
of
psychotic
mutts
And
that,
I
promise
you.
I
don't
make
a
very
good
babysitter.

Don't
sell
yourself
short.
You're
gonna
make
a
very
good
babysitter.
Be
there
at
7:00.
Hey.
I'm
Maggie
Chang.
-
You're
Barney
Ross?
Mr.
Church
told
you
about
me?
Said
you
wanna
tag
along?
Help,
not
tag
along.
Nice
motorcycle.
Where
we're
going
is
new.
Is
it
custom?
I
think
it's
a
mistake,
you
coming
along.
Build
it
yourself?
Yeah,
I
built
it
myself.
No.
Are
you
playing
games
with
me?
Church
told
me
what
you
said.
I'm
combat
proficient.
So,
when
do
we
leave?
0500.
Nice
meeting
you.



She's
into
me.
She
hates
you.




Um...

You
know,
if
something
happens
to
her,
Did
you
ever
think
to
ask
me
I
told
you
10
times
before,
I
didn't
have
a
Yeah,
well,
Church
intimidated
you.
-
Really?

Oh,
is
that
the
woman
You
know,
I
will
stab
you
one
day.
Hey,
baby.
Yeah,
of
course
I'm
thinking
about
you.
What
else
is
there
to
think
about?

Hopeless.
Hey.
You
were
in
the
Army,
right?
I
can
tell.
Yes,
ma'am.
Three
years.
Last
tour
was
Afghanistan,
Kunar
Province.
Didn't
like
it
any
more?
Uh...
Long
story.
-
I
would
like
to
hear
it.
I
was
trained
as
a
sniper,
but
I
actually
wanted
to
mix
it
up,
Uh,
this
one
time,
we're
stuck
out
About
30
Taliban
opened
up
And
they
got
about
eight
of
us
So
I
called
in
for
artillery
support.
Didn't
wanna
endanger
the
locals.
So
we
scattered.
Some
crawled
to
a
ditch,
But
we
were
still
stuck
in
the
kill
zone.
And
we
battled
for,
And
finally,
an
Apache
gunship
chopper
Scattered
the
Hadjis,
but...
Smoke
clears
and
four
of
my
squad
are
dead
Yeah,
I
was
mad
and
sick,
You
know
the
most
screwed
up
thing
of
all
is
when
I
got
back
to
base
that
night,
I
found
out
that
they
had
shot
Commander's
orders
to
get
rid
I
mean,
you'd
think
we
had
enough
damn
And,
anyway,
I
heard
these
guys
were
looking
You
got
that
transponder?
-
Yes.
Apparently,
15
kilometers
northwest.

Hello,
darlin'.
CHRISTMAS:
Hello,
darlin'.
Let's
move.
We're
in
and
out
of
here
fast.
HALE:
The
sooner,
the
better.
-
Billy
the
Kid.
Today's
your
lucky
day.
My
pleasure,
sir.
Impressive.
Hold
on.
Remember
when
you
could
do
that?
No,
do
you?
I
could
blow
him
away
if
I
needed
to.
Really?
Look
down.
Look
down.
You
see
what
I
see?
Short
legs.
1
,000
bucks
you
can't
catch
him.
I'm
a
little
busy.
Are
you?
BILLY:

Found
the
wreck
Slow
it
down,
Billy.
-
BILLY:
Say
it
again,
over?
-
BILLY:
Roger
that.
Slowing
it
down.
Rest
of
the
plane's
over
the
hill,
sir.
Good
work,
Billy.
HALE:
Looks
like
somebody
had
a
bad
day.
You
guys
go
to
the
right.

-

BARNEY:
Take
off,
Rover.
All
right,
Billy.
Ask
him.
What
you
doing,
Gunner?
I'm
making
a
bomb.
You
mind?
-
A
maniac
with
brains.
Phosphate
rock,
it's
got
a
density
of
1
.852.
Melting
point,
44.2
centigrade.
Guys,
I
want
some
gunpowder,
fast.
Do
it.
The
man's
a
chemical
engineer,
right?
And
a
Fulbright
Scholar.
Pour
it
in
the
pipe.
There's
fur
in
their
hands.
These
guys
were
alive
-
until
the
wolves
got
to
them.
Be
careful.

Is
this
it?
Yes,
it's
here.
BARNEY:
Caesar!
I
need
you
in
here.
Caesar,
grab
a
hold
of
this
thing.
Lee,
hook
it
on.
Now,
on
the
count
of
three,
let's
pull
it
back.
Ready?
One,
two,
three.

-
We
can't
hold
this.


BARNEY:
Come
on,
Maggie!
-
Something's
wrong.
The
explosive
timer's
triggered.
-
How
long?
If
we
leave
now,
we'll
make
it.
-
Maggie,
let
it
go!
-
BARNEY:
Come
on,
Maggie!
Maggie,
what's
going
on?
She
tripped
the
detonator.
Stay
back!
I'm
losing
my
grip!
You
do,
she's
cut
in
half.
-
Come
on,
Maggie!

Yeah,
lucky
I
was
here.
Just
thinking
that.
I'm
sorry.
It's
important
I
get
this.
You've
got
guts.
No
common
sense.
But
guts.
Come
on.
It's
all
right.
We
got
it.
Let's
go.
You're
strong.
Billy,
come
on
down.
We're
out
of
here.
GUNNER:
What
happened?
HALE:
That
woman
is
crazy,
CHRISTMAS:
Aren't
you
curious
No,
I
just
wanna
get
Church
off
our
back.
Billy
the
Kid!
Where
the
hell
is
he?
Billy!

VILAIN:
Drop
your
weapons!
TOLL:
No
way.
It
ain't
happening.
No?
Are
you
sure?
I'm
sorry,
sir.
They
were
waitin'.
-
Drop
the
weapons
now.

He's
a
strong
soldier.
Let's
see
how
strong
he
is.
Do
it.
-
No!

Don't
do
nothin'
he
says!
Don't
talk.
You
should
not
speak.
I'm
gonna
kill
him.
When
I
fire,
his
head
will
be
gone.
Three
seconds.
Don't
give
your
weapons.
VILAIN:
One.
Two.
Don't
do
this!
They'll
kill
everyone!
He's
gonna
kill
him.

Drop
them!

I'm
impressed.
Everybody
stay
calm,
we'll
be
done
soon
Bring
me
that
knife.
What's
this
symbol?
I
like
symbol.
This
is
the
symbol
of
the
goat.
The
pet
of
Satan,
they
say.
-
You
have
a
case
that
belongs
to
me.
Yes,
like
your
lives.
It
was
lost.
He
doesn't
have
it.
Last
time,
the
case,
or
you
will
force
me
to
cut
his
heart
out.
Do
it,
you
piece
of
shit.
Wait!

Let
me
have
it.
Hey.
You
talking
to
me?
Pick
it
up.
-
Hand
it
to
me.
-
What
was
that?
Now
pick
it
up,
hand
it
to
me
nicely,
or
you'll
get
what
he
got.
Do
it,
Lee.
You'll
be
all
right,
Billy.
Respect
is
everything.
Without
respect,
we're
just
people.
Common,
shitty
people.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
It's
not
your
fault.
Now
what?
We're
both
fighting
men.
And
I
respect
that.
And
fighting
men,
they
don't
deserve
to
be
killed
like
sheep.
But
respect
must
be
taught.
Lie
down
with
your
face
Don't
challenge
me.
Get
down.

Up.
Are
you
afraid
of
me?
No.
I'm
not.
You
should
be.
-
I'm
dying.
Cut
his
hands
loose!
The
letter.
I'm
so
sorry.
BARNEY:
I
believe
you.
What
was
in
the
case?
A
computer.
Blueprint
of
a
mine.
A
mine.
What
mine?
The
Russians
stored
nearly
5
tons
The
mine
was
abandoned
after
the
Cold
War.
The
blueprint
shows
We
want
to
stop
it
I
guess
that
didn't
happen,
did
it?
This
kid
died
so
some
dirtbag
I'm
so
sorry.
Not
as
sorry
as
I
am.
Let's
take
care
of
him.
"Dear
Sophia.
"I
wish
I
could
find
something
different
"but
I
can't.
"The
team's
treating
me
good.
"I
want
you
to
know
that
wherever
I
end
up,
"And
if
some
miracle
happens,
"I
hope
I'm
still
your
man.
Much
love,
Billy."
Why
is
it
that
who
deserves
to
live
the
most,
dies?
And
the
ones
that
deserve
to
die,
What's
the
message
in
that?
What's
the
plan?
Track
him,
find
him,
kill
him.

What's
this
about?
MR.
CHURCH:
What's
taking
so
long,
This
should
have
been
a
walk
in
the
park
Don't
have
it.
I
warned
you
what
would
happen
A
good
man
died
trying
to
get
that
case.
-
I'm
sorry
about
that.
Yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
I
am.
But
this
sort
of
situation
comes
And
so
does
payback.
You
know,
Church,
you're
the
kind
of
guy
and
everyone
else
does
your
dirty
work
'cause
you
never
had
the
guts
We're
done.

Sir,
we
got
a
problem.
The
digging
has
slowed
down.
They're
exhausted.

He's
tired.
Anybody
else
tired?
Get
more
workers.
We've
already
taken
most
Get
all
the
rest.
Women,
children,
all
of
them.
Show
me.
Now
we
know
where
it
is.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
I
know
what
to
do.
Good,
I
want
the
plutonium
out
Three
days?
I
have
people
ready
Three
days.
No
more.
Understood.
You're
smart.
is
powerful
enough
to
change
So,
imagine
what
5
tons
would
do.
It's
very
interesting.
Yeah?
-
Something's
happening.
The
transmission
stopped.
Putting
it
down
right
here.
BARNEY:
Come
on,
let's
hustle,
hustle.
Christmas.
Come
on,
Lee.
Do
you
Five
minutes.
-
Don't
get
your
knickers
in
a
twist.
BARNEY:
Another
transport
truck.
Let's
check
this
place
out.
-

-
Classics?
I've
been
dying
to
use
these.
We'll
beat
the
truth
out
of
them.
Maggie,
you
tell
the
guys
Okay.
-

-
They're
here.
Speak
English?
-
He's
slightly
gigantic.
Just
sayin'.
-
He's
really
gigantic.

Hey!
-

Can't
beat
a
classic.
I
say
we
beat
some
info
out
of
Sounds
good
to
me.
Let's
start
with
the
midget.
MAGGIE:
Calm
down,
boys.
What's
she
gonna
do,
give
him
a
pedicure?

It's
a
little
sick.
Christmas,
I
need
you
to
hotwire
that
truck
and
go
back
to
the
plane
Why
don't
you
get
Stop
complaining.
CHRISTMAS:
I
should've
bounced
-
GUNNER:
How'd
it
go?
TOLL:
Cheese-heads.
They
call
themselves
Sangs.
They
say
they
control
Robbery,
kidnapping,
assassinations.
How
do
you
know
the
language?
Easy.
Put
it
together.
It's
a
cross
between
Impressed?
A
little.
Christmas.
-
What?
'Cause
you
gave
me
the
shit
job,
that's
why.
I'm
gonna
shoot
you
in
the
face
BARNEY:
Where
are
you?
The
60-year-old
death
trap
you
call
a
plane.
Well,
what's
taking
so
long?
Because
there's
bridges
out,
signs
missing.
I've
been
driving
these
dirt
roads
You
done
complainin'?
Thanks
for
the
sympathy.
This
is
weird.
Just
like
home.
That
figures.
What
the
hell
is
this
place?
MAGGIE:
I
believe
Probably
used
in
the
'80s.
Cold
War.
They
most
likely
staged
maneuvers
Is
there
anything
you
don't
know?
HALE:
Great.
Just
what
I
need.
We'll
bed
down
here
for
the
night.

Oh.
This
tastes
like
shit.
How's
yours?
Can't
complain
about
rigatoni.
Plan
ahead,
fellas.
That's
all
I
have
to
say.
Y'all,
what
if
you
knew
What
would
your
last
meal
be?
-
One
choice.
It'd
probably
be
cereal
for
you,
huh?
And
what
the
hell's
wrong
with
cereal?
It's
cliché.
HALE:
You
gotta
be
original.
You
know,
you'd
probably
come
up
You
know,
just
like
your
ear.
they
just
lay
there
and
you
don't
hear
shit.
For
the
record,
my
hearing
is
20/20.
Barney?
Donuts
and
most
food
that
kills
ya.
That's
deep,
man.

You
think
so?
Maggie?
Crispy
aromatic
duck
with
plum
sauce.
Very
sexy.
But
I
like
Italian,
too.
I'm
starting
to
think
Italian's
overrated.

Hey.
What
about
me?
My
favorite
Swedish
dinner
would
be
baby
seal
and
whale
ass
in
the
summer.
But
I'd
really
die
for
some
Chinese.
Then
you're
gonna
starve
to
death.

All
right,
sweet
dreams.
Hey,
Barney.
I'm
not
done
eatin',
man.
Can
I
ask
you
something?
Sure,
go
ahead.
Why
are
you
so
nervous
around
me?
I
don't
get
nervous,
Maggie.
What
is
it
then?
I
just
like
keeping
a
distance.
Is
it
because
you
don't
want
Let's
just
say
bad
things
have
happened
Not
a
good
way
to
live.
I
know.
Do
you
think
about
All
the
time.
You
don't
talk
about
him
much.
No,
that's
how
we
deal
with
death.
We
can't
change
what
it
is,
And
then
we
get
pitch
black.
Understand?
I
understand.
Good
night.
Good
night,
Maggie.


I
swear
to
God,
if
he
doesn't
stop
snoring,
Gunner!

You
rang?
I
know
it's
a
stupid
question.
I
don't
suppose
you
have
Pot
only
makes
one
cup.
Yeah.
That's
what
I
figured.
BARNEY:
Listen
up.
Those
guys
said
the
congregation
of
Sangs
concentrated
east.
So
that's
where
we're
going.
We're
out
of
here
in
10
minutes.
Get
ready.
Do
what
you
gotta
do.


Houston,
we
got
a
problem.
-
Down!

We
gotta
get
out
of
here!
-
Go!
Go,
go,
go,
go!
Go.
Save
your
ammo.

Where
the
hell
are
you?
I'm
almost
there.
Hey,
what's
going
on?
Are
those
shots?
Yeah.
-
CHRISTMAS:
What's
happening?
-
Can
you
hold
them
off?
-
Oh,
shit.
They
got
a
tank.
Oh!
Let's
roll!
Come
on!
I'm
out.
One
left.
Why
not?
Hey,
who
did
that?
Not
me,
I'm
out.
Hey,
what
just
happened?
Somebody
got
a
little
carried
away.
It
looks
that
way.
Where
are
the
shooters?
I
don't
know,
but
if
they
wanted
us
dead,
Barney?

Don't
freak
out.
Small
world,
huh,
Barney?
Booker?
Rumor
had
it
you
were
dead.
Yeah,
I
heard
that,
too.
Been
better.
You
did
all
this?
I
fly
solo.
I
thought
you
knew
that.
Yeah,
I
heard
it,
but
I
didn't
buy
it.
Well,
now
you
do.
This
your
team?
Yeah.
Gunner,
Toll
Road,
Booker.
You're
the
one
I've
been
called
that.
But
I
have
mellowed.
Not
that
much.
I
heard
another
rumor,
Yeah,
I
was.
the
cobra
died.

Hey,
Booker.
Great
to
see
you,
man.
BOOKER:
So,
how'd
you
end
up
We
got
ambushed
by
Sangs
killed
one
of
my
men,
young
kid.
-
Yeah,
sorry
to
hear
that.
The
Sangs
are
the
lowest
form
of
scum.
Shooting
them
has
been
a
good
business.
Do
you
know
who
the
leader
is?
-
Yeah,
a
guy
named
Vilain.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah,
he
pretty
much
controls
You're
gonna
need
more
men
Can
you
help
out?
Ah,
sorry,
Barney.
I
work
alone.
I
understand.
Thanks
for
showing
up.
My
pleasure.
Hey,
Barney!
There's
a
village
down
the
road.
They're
good
people,
-
Maybe
they
can
help
out.
Happy
hunting.
What
happened?
I'm
still
alive.
That's
a
matter
of
opinion.
What'd
I
miss?
I'll
tell
you
about
it
on
the
way.
Looks
like
Christmas
Yeah,
I
love
you,
too.
Well,
I'm
happy
to
see
you.
Finally.
Somebody
with
class.

This
has
gotta
be
the
town
I
could
retire
to
a
place
like
this.
Clean
air,
no
stress,
raise
some
kids.
You
know,
Maggie,


BARNEY:
Out,
out,
out!
They're
missing
us
by
a
mile.
-
PILAR:
Put
down
guns.
-

The
safest
place
is
in
front
of
their
gun.
-

No!
Wait.
These
guys
are
here
to
help.
Even
you
two
rejects
-
You
think?
Do
you
mind?
Who
you
are?
-
We're
Americans.
Swedish.
-
Blackfoot.
-
Retards.
What
do
you
want?
We're
here
to
take
care
of
the
Sangs.
Okay.
Come
inside.
Come
on.

This
is
who
we
think
you'd
come
for.
This
is
who
we
will
die
for.
First,
they
told
us
there'd
be
Some
went.
But
nobody
come
back.
They
come
for
more.
They
say
as
soon
as
our
men
go
to
job,
the
others
come
home.
My
husband
goes.
For
a
long
time,
we
hear
nothing.
Then
the
Sangs
come,
and
they
take
Forced
them
to
work
in
the
mines.
Same
in
the
next
village.
And
the
next.
They
take
my
sons.
Now
all
that
is
left
are
the
very
young.
And
they
will
be
back
for
them,
too.
We
all
know
this.
So
we
hide
them
and
we
wait.
Why
don't
you
just
move
on?
Leave.
PILAR:
This
is
our
home.
Our
lives
will
be
the
last
thing
they
take.
Tell
us
why
you're
here
now.
We're
tracking
them.
Can't
you
stay
and
help?
Soon
they'll
be
done,
We
have
our
own
business
with
them.
I'm
sorry.
Let's
go.

I
don't
think
I
think
they
know
that.
So
we're
not
gonna
do
anything
about
it?

I
got
an
idea.
And
with
your
ego,
-
My
ego?
-
What
do
you
mean,
my
ego?
Well,
check
your
ego
out.
Oh,
please.
Your
ego
is
like

We
have
it.
We
found
the
plutonium.













CHRISTMAS:
By
the
power
vested
in
me,
man
and
knife.




One
more!
Rest
in
pieces.

-
This
is
the
last
one?
Good.

The
chambers
are
cleared.
No
loose
ends.
You
bury
them
all.
BARNEY:
I
see
about
a
dozen
guards,
a
couple
of
badass
.50
cals.
CHRISTMAS:
Worse.
Anti-tank
devices.
There's
no
way
our
trucks
will
Look,
I
know
this
is
a
stupid
question,
but
you
got
any
ideas
I
got
a
few
I'm
thinking
about.


-
Boom
time?
BARNEY:
Target
in
sight!
-
Baby
wants
to
travel!
-
Rock
and
roll!
Bombs
away!

Tighten
up!
-
What's
happening
now?
-
You're
not
doing
what
I
think
you're
doing.
Let's
do
it!
Come
on,
let's
move!


You're
gonna
need
a
new
plane.



-
We're
too
late!
The
plutonium's
gone.


Come
on,
come
on,
let's
get
out
of
here!
-

Move
it,
move
it,
move
it!
CHRISTMAS:
Go,
go,
go!
Go
on,
get
out
of
here!
Go,
go,
go,
go!
Pick
it
up!
Pick
it
up!

We're
gonna
be
here
awhile.
Oh,
this
is
embarrassing.
Yeah,
it
sure
is.
CHRISTMAS:
What's
he
doing
here?
Saving
this
Chinese
billionaire.
Oh,
yeah?
That's
funny.
So
are
we.
Well,
then
we
have
a
scheduling
problem,
Cut
me
loose,
Frankenstein.
BARNEY:
Don't
get
nuts,
Gunner.
Do
it.

-
Where's
your
team?
I
need
a
weapon.
Something
big.
-
Yours.
My
big
weapon's
hangin'
right
where
it
is.

Doesn't
seem
right.
Going
out
this
chickenshit
way?
Something
like
that.
Hey,
it
ain't
over
yet,
kids.
I
got
a
plan.
Everybody
calm
down.
Phosphate
rock.
What's
he
doing?
Probably
making
a
bomb.
You
serious?
Not
that
much.
I
heard
another
rumor,
Yeah,
I
was.
the
cobra
died.

Hey,
Booker.
Great
to
see
you,
man.
Ask
him.
What
you
doing,
Gunner?
I'm
making
a
bomb.
You
mind?
-
A
maniac
with
brains.
Phosphate
rock,
it's
got
a
density
of
1
.852.
Melting
point,
44.2
centigrade.
Guys,
I
want
some
gunpowder,
fast.
Do
it.
The
man's
a
chemical
engineer,
right?
And
a
Fulbright
Scholar.
Pour
it
in
the
pipe.
-
The
big
man
might
be
onto
something.
Probably
not.
You
need
some
help
with
that?
Let's
go!
Here.
Go
blow
yourself
up.
Lighter?
I
want
that
back.
Better
get
back!
This
is
gonna
be
loud!

Get
back!
Okay.
All
right,
let's
go!
All
right.
Better
turn
around
You
better
cover
your
ear.
Come
on.
Well,
the
phosphorus
must
have
been
damp.
Yeah,
right.
TOLL:
Or
you
suck.
Don't
cry,
Gunner.
BARNEY:
You
almost
had
an
idea.


I'm
back.
How're
you
doin',
Trench?

-
Oh,
I
thank
you.
I
thank
you.
Bojan!


Hmm.
-
We're
even
now,
right?
I'll
be
seeing
you
around,
Trench.
-
Relax.
It's
not
over
yet.
That's
right.

-
How
ya
doin',
pal?
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
I
heard
there
was
a
party
in
town.
-
Has
he
always
been
this
selfish?
Thanks.

You
wanna
kick
Vilain's
ass
or
not?
Don't
forget
the
Little
Rascals!
Move
it.

Move
out!


Take
the
rest
of
the
nukes
to
the
hangar.
And
get
the
plutonium
on
the
plane.
Follow
me.
We
need
to
buy
some
time.


Go,
go!


I'm
out!
VILAIN:
Hold
them
up!
Go!
Go!
Move!
Shit!
-
Fun,
huh?
Oh,
there
he
is!
Come
on,
Vilain.
-
Let's
go!
Tear
him
apart!

I'm
almost
out.
I'll
be
back.
You've
been
back
enough.
I'll
be
back.
Yippee-ki-yay.
Who's
next?
Rambo?
Goodbye.

Let's
go.

GUNNER:
Maggots!
VILAIN:
Start
the
engine!
Get
that
thing
in
the
air.
HECTOR:
Move!
Trench!
Get
in!
My
shoe
is
bigger
than
this
car.
Shoot
something!

MR.
CHURCH:
Come
on.

Start
the
helicopter.
Let's
go!


Take
care
of
him!
This
way!


Cannot
beat
a
classic.

-
Barney!
I'm
going
in
there
alone.
Don't
follow
me,
no
matter
what,
-
Do
you
understand?
That
door
opens
up,
and
I
don't
come
out,
VILAIN:
Let's
make
it
more
dramatic.
Now,
that's
better.

I'm
out
of
bullets.
That's
your
problem.
VILAIN:
Not
really.
You
wanna
kill
me
like
a
man?
Or
you
wanna
kill
me
like
a
sheep?
Nice
knife.
So.
What's
it
going
to
be?
Man
or
sheep?
You
wanna
man
up?
I'll
man
you
up.

You
must
want
to
hurt
me
bad.
I'm
not
gonna
hurt
you.
Come.

Over
so
soon?
I
want
my
money's
worth.
-
Come
on,
get
up!
Going
back
down.
Taste
good?
Talking
to
me?

Time
to
wrap
this
up.


Ironic.
Here
we
are,
you
and
I.
And
your
knife.
You're
going
to
die.
Like
him.
What
was
his
name?
What
did
you
call
him?
What
does
it
matter?
Come
on,
Vilain.
Somebody's
dying.
Come
on,
Vilain.
Come
on!

Get
up,
Vilain.
Get
up.
Now
turn
around.
Turn
around,
sheep.

Now
what?

His
name
was
Billy.

You
know
how
to
carve
a
turkey?

-
You
win?
Well,
where's
the
proof?
Heads
up.
Nice
touch.
Mmm-hmm.
It
is
a
nice
touch.
A
little
extreme.
But
nice.
Mmm-hmm.
And
as
much
as
I
hate
to
say
this,
now
that
we
got
control
of
the
plutonium,
that
makes
us
even.
Good.
So,
Maggie,
you'll
be
coming
with
us
then?
When
you're
ready.
So
I
just
want...
Wow.
They're
okay,
just
a
little
immature.
I
don't
have
to
go.
And
I
did
save
the
babysitter's
life.
That
you
did
do.
Maybe
I'm
good
luck
for
you.
But
I
could
be
bad
luck
for
you,
If
you
ever
want
help,
call
me,
or
you're
dead.
I'll
do
that.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Moving
on.
You
killed
all
my
business.
I
thought
you
were
the
Lone
Wolf.

Sometimes
it's
fun
to
run
with
the
pack.
Sure,
you
got
a
point.
You
take
care,
Maggie.
Oh,
I
almost
forgot.
As
a
token
of
my
gratitude,
I
got
you
and
the
Little
Rascals
a
ride
home.
-
Behold.
Consider
it
a
gift.
-
That
thing
belongs
in
a
museum.
-
We
all
do.
-
Hey,
fun,
right?
Take
care.

Beware,
beware,
Careful
what
you
do.
Or
Mumbo-Jumbo's
gonna
hoo-doo
you.
Mumbo-Jumbo's
gonna
hoo-doo
you.
Boomlay,
boomlay,
boomlay,
boom!
To
Billy!
-
To
Billy.
GUNNER:
Rest
in
peace.
-
Man,
I
need
a
massage.
-
Hey.
-
From
one
friend
to
another?
You
really
should
learn
how
to
fight.
