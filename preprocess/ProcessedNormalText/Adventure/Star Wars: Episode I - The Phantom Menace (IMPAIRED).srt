But
not

Be
mindful
of

Yes,
Master.
How
do
you
think
this
trade
viceroy
These
Federation
types
The
negotiations
What?
The
ambassadors
are
Jedi
knights,
I
knew
it.
They're
here
Distract
them.
Are
you
brain-dead?
I'm
not
going
in
there
Send
a

Is
it
in
their
nature
No.
I
sense
an
unusual
amount
of
fear
What
is
it?
This
scheme
of
yours
The
blockade
is
finished.
Viceroy,
I
don't
want
This
turn
of
events
We
must
accelerate
our
plans.
My
lord,
I
will
make
it
legal.
And
the
Jedi?
The
chancellor
should
never
have
brought
Yes.
Yes,
my
lord.
Captain,
look!
Shields
up!
Sorry.
Dioxis.
They
must
be
dead
by
now.
Destroy
what's
left
of
them.
Oh!
Excuse
me.
-
Check
it
out,
Corporal.
Uh-oh.
Blast
them.
What
is
going
on
We
lost
the

Have
you
ever
encountered
Well,
no,
but
I
don't...
-
Yes,
sir.
I
want
droidekas
We
will
not

Close
the
blast
doors!
That
will
hold
them.
They
are
still
This
is
impossible!
Where
are
Master!
Destroyers!
They
have

It's
a
standoff.
They're
no
match
Sir!
They've
gone

This
is

I

and
that
you

I
know
nothing
You
must
be
mistaken.
Beware,
Viceroy.
The
Federation
We
would
never
do
anything
You
assume
too
much.
We
will
see.
-
She's
right.
The
senate
will
never...
-
Do
you
think
she
suspects
an
attack?
But
we
must
move
quickly
to
disrupt
Negotiations

How
could
that
be
true?
I
have
assurances
from
the

It
must...

Nobody

What's

You're
a
Jedi
knight,
What
makes
you
think
that?
I
saw
your
laser
sword.
Perhaps
I
killed
a
Jedi
I
don't
think
so.
No
one
can
kill
a
Jedi.
I
wish
that
were
so.
I
had
a
dream
I
came
back
here
-
Have
you
come
to
free
us?
I
think
you
have.
I
can
see
there's
We're
on
our
way
to
Coruscant,
on
a
very
important
mission.
How
did
you
end
up
out
here
Our
ship
was
damaged,
and
we're
stranded
I
can
help.
-
I
can
fix
anything.
But
first
we
must
acquire
Wit
no-nutten
mula
These
junk
dealers
must
have
Gambling.
Everything
here
revolves
Podracing.
I
built
a
racer.
There's
a
big
race
tomorrow
-
You
could
enter
my
pod.
-
Watto
won't
let
you.
You
could
make
him
think
and
get
him
to
let
me
I
don't
want
you
to
race.
It's
awful.
But,
Mom,
I
love
it.
The
prize
money
would
more
than
pay
Anakin.
Your
mother's
right.
Is
there
anyone
friendly
to
the
Republic
No.
Mom,
you
say
the
biggest
problem
in
this
I'm
sure
Qui-Gon
doesn't
want
We'll
find
some
other
way.
No.
There
is
no
other
way.
I
may
not
like
it,
He
was
meant

Are
you
sure
about
this?
Trusting
our
fate
The
queen
The
queen
Well,
I
don't
approve.
-
How
can
you
do
this?
Not
on
My
ship
will
be
Oh,
not
bad!
Not
bad,
huh?
It's
in
good
order,
What
would
the
boy
ride?
He
smashed
up
my
pod
in
the
last
race.
It
wasn't
my
fault,
really.
I
actually
saved
the
pod,
Mmm.
That
you
did,
huh.
The
boy's
good.
I
have
acquired
a
pod
in
a
game
I
hope
you
didn't
kill

So,
you
supply
the
pod
and
I
supply
the
boy.
We
split
the
winnings,
If
it's
going
to
be
50-50,
I
suggest
If
we
win,
you
keep
all
the
winnings,
And
if
we
lose,
Either
way,
you
win.


Deal!

What
if
this
plan
fails,
We
could
be
stuck
here
Well,
it's
too
dangerous
and
a
ship
without
a
power
supply
And...
there's
something
You
should
be
very
proud
He
gives
without
Well,
he
knows
-
He
has
a...
Yes.
He
can
see
things
That's
why
he
appears
It's
a
Jedi
trait.
-He
deserves
better
than
a
slave's
life.
Had
he
been
born
in
the
Republic,
The
Force
is
unusually
strong
with
him.
Who
was
his
father?
There
was
no
father.
I
carried
him,
I
gave
birth,
I
can't
explain
Can
you
help
him?
I
don't

Come

Keep

Ani.

Hey,

If
your

caught
in
the
beam,
Sorry.
Okay.


My
tongue...
Where
is
da
wrench?
Hey.
Uh-oh.
Uh,
Ani,
I'm
stuck.
You
know,
I
find
that

It
will.
-
Here,

Come

Ani,
I'm
stuck.
Uh,
hey.
You're
quite
right.
Oh.
Th...
Thank
you.
Go.

It's
working!
Stay
still,
Ani.
There's
so
many.
Most
of
them.
Has
anyone
been

I
wanna
be
the
first
one
-
Ani,
bedtime!
There
we
are.
Ani,
I'm
not
gonna

What
are
you
doing?
Go
on.
You
have
Sleep
well,
Ani.
-
Obi-Wan?
I
need
an
analysis
of
this

sample
-
Wait
a
minute.
I
need
The

Over
20,000.
Even

No

What
does
that
mean?
I'm
not

I
wanna
see
your

my
blue
friend.
You'll
have
And
we'll
be
far
away
Not
if
your
ship
belongs

-
You
don't
think
Anakin
can
win?
I
have
great
faith
He's
a
credit
but,
uh,
Sebulba
there

Oh,
no!

Why
do
you
think
that?
He
always
wins!
I
am
betting
heavily
-
I'll
take
that
bet.
I'll
wager
my
new
racing
pod
the
boy
and
his
mother.
No
pod
is
worth
two
slaves,
The
boy,
then.
Hmm.
Well,
uh...
We'll
let
fate
decide,
I
just
happen
to
have
Blue,
it's
the
boy.
Red,
uh...
his
mother.

You
won
this
small
toss,
outlander,
So
it
makes


Better
stop
your
friend's
betting,
or
I'll
end
up
owning
him
too.

What'd
he
mean
by
that?
Good
morning.

I
can
assure
you,
they
will
never
get
This
is
so
wizard,
Ani.
-
Do
what?
-
You've
never
won
a
race?
Not
even
finished?
Kitster's
right.
Of
course
you
will.

You.
You
swindled
me!
You
knew
the

Come
on.
Hup!
Hey.
Yes!
Mom,
we
sold

Look
at
all
the
money
we
have!

But
that's
so
wonderful,

-
What?
Did
you
hear
that?
Now
you
can
make
You
are
free.
Will
you
take
him

Is
he
to
become
a
Jedi?

meeting
Nothing
happens
You
mean
I
get
to
come
with
you
Anakin,
training
to
become
a
Jedi
and
even
if
you
succeed,
But
I
wanna
go.
Can
I
go,
Mom?
Anakin,
this
path
has
been
placed
The
choice
I
wanna
do
it.
Then
pack
your
things.
Yippee!
What
about
Mom?
Is
she
free
too?
I
tried
to
free
your
mother,
Ani,
You're
coming
with
us,
Son,
my
place
is
here.
It
is
time
I
don't
want
things
But
you
can't
stop
any
more
than
you
can
Oh,
I
love
you.

Now
hurry.
Thank
you.
I'll
watch
after
him.
Will
you
be
all
right?
Yeah.
Oh!
Hello,
Master
Anakin.
Well,

and
I'm
going
away

you
are

I
should

it
if
I'm

I'll

so.
Yes.
I

I
think
so.
What
was

I'm
not

it
was
-

What
are
we
gonna
do

shall
be
patient.
Anakin
Skywalker,
-
Hi.
You're
a
Jedi
too?
Your
queen
is
lost,
and
you,
Governor,
much
sooner
than
your
people,
This
invasion
We're
a
democracy.
Take
him
away.
My
troops
are
in
position
for
these
rumored
They
will
not

The
death
toll
We
must
bow
You
must
You
all
right?
It's
very
cold.

You
come
from
A
little
too
warm
Space
is
cold.
You
seem
sad.
The
queen
is
worried.
Her
people
are
suffering,
She
must
convince
the
senate
I'm
not
sure
what'll
happen.
I
made
this
for
you...
so
you'd
remember
me.
I
carved
it
It'll
bring
you
It's
beautiful.
But
I
don't
need
this
Many
things
will
change
but
my
caring
for
you
I
care
for
you,
too,
Miss
your
mother.
Coruscant.
There's
Chancellor
Valorum's
shuttle.
And
look
over
there.
It
is
a
great
gift
to
see
you
alive,
With
the
communications
breakdown,
I'm
anxious
to
hear
your
report
May
I
present
Welcome,
Your
Highness.
It's
an
honor
Thank
you,
I
must
relay
to
you
how
distressed
I've
called
for
a
special
session
I'm
grateful
for
your
concern,
There
is
a
question
but
I'm
confident
I
must
speak
with
The
situation
has
become
Ani,
come
on.
The
queen's
a
bein'
grossly
nice,
Pitty
hot.


The
Republic
The
senate
is
full
of
greedy,
There
is
no
interest...
in
the
common
good.
I
must
be
frank,
There
is
little
chance

senate
Chancellor
Valorum
If
I
may
say
so,
Your
Majesty,
He
is
mired
by
baseless
-
The
bureaucrats
are
in
charge
now.
Our
best
choice
would
be
of
a
stronger
one
who
could
control
and
give
us
justice.
You
could
call
for
in
Chancellor
Valorum.
He
has
been
Our
only
other
choice
would
be
The
courts
take
even
longer
Our
people
are
dying,
We
must
do
something
quickly
To
be
realistic,
I
think
we're
going
to
have
to
accept
That
is
something
He
was
trained
My
only
conclusion
can
be
I
mpossible.
The
Sith
have
been
I
do
not
believe

Sith
Ah,
hard
to
see,
We
will
use
all
our
resources
We
will
discover
the
identity
May
the
Force

More
to
say
have
you?
With
your
permission,
I
have
encountered
A
vergence,
you
say?
Located
around
a
person?
A
boy.
His
cells
have
the
highest
It
is
possible
he
was
conceived
You
refer
of
the
one
who
will
bring
You
believe
-
I
don't
presume
to...
Revealed
your
opinion
is.
I
request
the
boy
Oh?
Trained
as
a
Jedi
Finding
him
I
have
no
doubt
of
that.

Bring
him
before
us,
then.

I'm
sorry,
Ani,
Who
is
it?
Anakin
Skywalker
to
see
Padme,
I've
sent
Padme
I'm
on
my
way
to
the
Jedi
temple
I
may
never
see
her
again,
We
will
tell
her
for
you.
We
are
sure
Thank
you,
Your
Highness.
