up
on
you.
You're
doing
fine.
You
don't
seem
afraid
at
all.
l
don't
understand
that.
Well,
fear's
sort
of
an
odd
thing.
When
l
was
in
residency,
was
a
spinal
surgery
And
at
the
end,
after
1
3
hours,
l
accidentally
ripped
her
dural
sack.
lt's
at
the
base
of
the
spine
Membrane
as
thin
as
tissue,
and...
So
it
ripped
open.
Nerves
just
spilled
spinal
fluid
flowing
The
terror
was
just
so...
...crazy,
so
real...
...and
l
knew
l
had
to
deal
with
it.
So
l
just
made
a
choice.
l'd
let
the
fear
in.
But
only
for
five
seconds,
So
l
started
to
count.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five.
And
it
was
gone.
l
went
back
to
work,
lf
that
had
been
me,
l
think
No,
l
don't
think
that's
true.
You're
not
running
now.
You
think
they
Hmm?
-
Who?
As
if
l'm
gonna
start
eating
chocolate.
-
Shannon,

may
be
here
for
a
while.
They

exactly
where
we
are,

eat
on
the
rescue
boat.

Hungry?
Any
more...
No...

Well,

there.
You
sure
you're
warm
enough?

Do
you
think
he's
gonna
live?
Do
you
know
him?
He
was
sitting
next
to
me.
We
must've
been
at
about
We
hit
an
air
pocket
and
dropped...
...maybe
200
feet.
The
turbulence
was...
l
blacked
out.
l
didn't.
l
saw
the
whole
thing.
l
knew
that
the
tail
was
gone,
but
l...
...couldn't
bring
myself
to
look
back.
And
then
the
front
end
Well,
it's
not
here
on
the
beach.
Neither
is
the
tail.
We
need
to
figure
out
-
Why?
lf
it's
intact,
we
might
be
able
We
could
send
out
a
signal,
How
do
you
know
all
that?
l
took
a
couple
of
flying
lessons.
Wasn't
for
me.

some
smoke...
...just
through
the
valley.

thinking
about
going
