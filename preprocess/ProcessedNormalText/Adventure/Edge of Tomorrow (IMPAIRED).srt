look

different
scenario.
Please.
A
best-selling

perhaps.
Maybe
a

well,

No,
of
course
you're
not.
That's
why
I'm
embedding
you
with
several
hundred
thousand
men
and
women
who

While
it
is
an
honor,
General,
I'm
afraid
I'm
gonna
have
to
decline.
Can't
stand
the
sight
of
blood.

are

just

To
join

And
when

come
home,
and
they're
looking
for
someone
to
blame...
How
hard
do
you
think
it
would
be
for
me
to
convince
people
to
blame
you?
I'd
imagine
that
the
General
would
prefer
to
avoid
that.

you
blackmailing
me,

I
would
prefer...
Not
to

of
heroism

what's
happening
to
me.
Come
with
me.
Now.
You
don't
talk
to
anyone
about
this
but
me.
'Cause
the
best
case
scenario
is
you're
gonna
end
up
in
a
psych
ward.
And
the
worst
case,
you'll
get
dissected
for
study.
Are
we
clear?
Yes?
Yes.
First
time
you
died,
what
happened?
You
killed
a
mimic?
Yes.
Describe
it.
Um...
it
was
different.
It
was,
uh,
bigger.
Bluish.
And
you
got
covered
in
its
blood.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
did.
They
know
we're
coming
on
the
beach
tomorrow.
It's
a
slaughter,
isn't
it?
How
do
you
know
this?
Could
you
just--
wait!
Wait.
Wait.
Look,
would
you
please
just
explain
to
me
what
the
hell
is
happening?
What
happened
to
you
happened
to
me.
I
had
it.
I
lost
it.
Okay?
I
mean,
that's
great.
How
do
I
get
rid
of
this?
First,
I
need
your
help.
Help
with--
with
what
exactly?
Winning
the
war.
Let's
go!
Come
on!

Rita,
what
is
this?
Rita?
You
gotta
give
me
some
warning.
Who's
this?
He's
me.
Before
Verdun.
He's
gonna
help
us.

What?
You-you
mean
he's--
yes.
When
did
he
die?
Where?
On
the
beach.
Tomorrow.
How
many
fingers
am
I
holding
up
behind
my
back?
How
should
I
know
that?
Okay.
So...
This
is
the
first
time
we've
had
this
conversation.
You
should
try
this
on
him.
What
the
hell
is
that?
It
doesn't
work.
Has
he
had
any
visions
yet?
Visions
of
what?
Okay,
so
there's
still
time.
Yes.
Time?
Look.
I--
I'm
sorry.
Which
is--?
Who
is
this?
Who
are
you?
I'm
Dr.
Carter.
Particle
physics.
He's
also
the
only
other
person
who'll
believe
what's
happening
to
you.
No
one
understands
mimic
biology
better
than
him.
He's
a
top
analyst
at
Whitehall.
Well,
I
mean,
I
was
until
I
met
Rita
and
now
I'm
just
a--
a
"mechanic
with
Carter.
Show
him.
Yeah,
right.
Right.
Well,
first
of
all...
You're
not
fighting
an
army.
You
have
to
think
of
this
as
a
single
organism.
Now...
these
common
drones,
they
act
like
its
claws.
And
alphas,
like
the
one
that
you
killed,
are
much
more
rare.
Yeah.
They're
like
one
in
six
by
my
guess.
Yes.
They
act
as
the
enemy's--
they're-they're
like
its
But
this
is
the
brain.
It
controls
them
all.
And
this
is
the
Omega.
And
the
Omega
has
the
ability
to
control
time.
Whenever
an
Alpha
is
killed...

An
automatic
response
is
triggered.
The
Omega
starts
the
day
over
again.
But
you
see,
this
time
it
can
remember
what's
going
to
happen...
Just
like
you
do.
I-I-it
knows
exactly
what
we're
And
an
enemy
that
knows
the
future
can't
lose.
It
can't
lose.
But
if
that's
true,
how
did
you
win
at
Verdun?
We
were
allowed
to
win.
This
thing
wants
us
to
believe
we
can
win.
It
wants
us
to
throw
everything
we
have
into
the
invasion.
Operation
downfall
isn't
our
endgame,
it's
the
enemy's.
The
thing
you've
got
to
understand
is
this
is
a
perfectly
evolved,
For
all
we
know,
there
are
thousands,
millions
of
those
asteroids
floating
around
in
the
cosmos
like
a
virus.
And
they're
just
waiting
with
just
the
right
conditions.
All
they
need
is
for
the
dominant
life
form
to
attack
and

And
there'll
be
nothing
to
stop
the
mimics
from
conquering
the
rest
of
the
world.
Unless
you
change
the
outcome.
Me?
When
you
killed
that
Alpha,
you
inadvertently
entered
the
enemy's
nervous
system.
Cage.
You've
seized
control
of
the
Omega's
ability
to
reset
the
day.
How's
that
even
possible?
Perhaps
this
organism's
only
vulnerability,
I-its
only
vulnerability
Regardless
of
that,
you
control
the
power
now.
Just
as
I
did
in
verdun.
So
I'm
resetting
the
day?
Okay.
How
do
I
control
it?
You
have
to
die.
Every
day.
Until
the
Omega's
destroyed.
First
of
all...
This
is
a
terrific
presentation.
Terrific.
I
know
the
General.
We
should
take
this
to
him.
You
just
tell
him
everything
you
told
me.
He
will
know
what--
I
went
Any
number
of
times.
Psych
ward.
Dissection.
Remember?
What
are
you
expecting
from
me?
Have
you
seen
anything
strange?
Is
he
shitting
me?
Visions.
Uh,
visions.
Have
you
seen
any
visions
like
that?
The
Omega
senses
when
it's
losing
control
of
its
power.
E-even
now
it's
mentally
RITA:
When
it's
close
you
will
start
having
visions.
You'll
start
to
see
that.
Eh--
you'll
even
see
where
it
is.
And
you
had
these
visions?
Yes.
But
eventually
you
saw
it.
I
mean,
you
actually
saw
it.
Right?
Never
in
the
flesh.
So
this
is
all
just
some...
theory.
You
don't
know
if
this
thing
even
exists.
The
visions
showed
me
it
was
at
Verdun.
I
could
see
it.
I--
I
just...
lost
the
power
before
I
could
get
to
it.
And
by
the
time
we
took
Verdun...
The
Omega
was
gone.
Okay.
So
all
I
have
to
do
is
wait
to
have
these...
visions,
and
then
tell
you
where
this...
Omega
thing
is.
No.
Cage.
You're
gonna
get
me
there.
And
I'm
gonna
kill
it.
Get
you
there?
I'm
not...
I'm
not
even
trained
for
combat.
Reload.
Reload.

Are
you
all
right,
Cage?
I
think
I
broke
something.
What?
My
back.
The
only
thing
I
can
Now
listen
carefully.
This
This
is
the
only
rule.
You
get
injured
on
the
field,
Why?
Last
time
I
was
in
combat,
I
was
hit.
I
was
bleeding
out.
I
woke
up
in
a
field
hospital
with
three
pints
of
someone
else's
blood
and
I
was
out.
I
lost
the
power.
Think
we
better
start
over.

#2:
My
uncle
George
landed
Yeah?
In
their
day,
this
war
would
have
been
over
by
now.
What
do
they
want
with
us,
anyway?
It's
obvious,
isn't
it?
Minerals?
Yeah,
minerals.
Oxygen,
they
want.
Oxygen?
What
difference
does
it
make?
They're
here.
They're
winning.
And
whatever
it
is,
they're
gonna
get
it.
Shouldn't
you
be
over
there?
I've
been
over
there.
More
times
than
anybody.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I'm...
Usually
long
dead
by
now.
Coward!

What's
going
on?
The
power's
gone.







CARTER:
I
found
the
Omega.
It
has
to
be
here.
This
has
got
to
be
it.
It
fits
the
description
perfectly.
Yes,
you
found
it.
Again.
What
difference
does
it
make?
'Cause
we're
never
gonna
get
there.
No
matter
what
we
do...
No
matter
how
carefully
we
plan,
we
can't
get
off
that
beach.


You
can
do
this.
You
can.
You
keep
coming
here
every
day
and
I'll
train
you.
You
already
have.
I'm
waitin',
Nance!
Five
hundred
meters
and
closing
fast!
What
the--?!

WOMAN:
Reload.

What's
next?
Straight
shot...
up
the
hill.
Okay.
Hey,
Sarge,
the
new
guy,
what's
his
name
again?
CAGE:
We'll
need
a
vehicle
RITA:
And
what's
the
problem?
The
problem
is
the
ambush
waiting
for
us
down
there.
They
kill
us
before
we
find
a
working
car.
Okay.
So,
what's
The
two
cars
we
haven't
tried
yet.
The
minivan...
yep.
...and
the
green
S.U.V.
Okay.
So
I'll
head
for
the
S.U.V.,
You
go
for
the
minivan.
You
get
it
started,
just
go,
take
off.
Do
not
wait
for
me.
Okay.
Whoa--
just...
Don't
forget
to
disconnect

You
are
going
to
be
in

hurry
and
you
don't
want
any

Come
on.


Come
on,
Cage!
WOMAN:

Our
troops
have
suffered
heavy
casualties.
The
enemy
has
breached
security
at
Dover.
And
all
are
advised
to...
...seek
shelter
as
Can
you?
In
further
updates,
mimics
have
now
been
sighted
at
Portsmouth,
Brighton
and
as
far
inland
as
Horsham.
The
government
advice
at
this
point
is
to
stay
where
you
are
and
remain
calm.
If
you
are
in
a
vehicle,
please
lock
doors
and
stay
inside.
We
are--
are
now
hearing
accounts
of
mimic
attacks
at
Canterbury,
Farnham,
and--
we--
we--
I'm
sorry.
The
enemy
has
reached
London.
Repeat...
London
is
under
attack.
It's
good
driving.
I
forgot
to
unhook
the
trailer.
Engaged.

You
don't
talk
much.
I'm
not
a
fan.
Of
talking?
Not
a
fan
of
talking.
No.
You
know
you
eventually
do
talk
to
me.
It's
usually
around
Lyons.
You
tell
me
about
the
time
you
Your
brother
got
lost.
I've
never
been
to
Lyons.
You
tell
me
your
middle
name.
Peyton.
That's
not
my
middle
name.
You
found
your
brother
in
the
arcade,
by
the
way.
Well,
maybe
I
made
it
all
up
just
to
keep
you
quiet.
But
you
do
talk
to
me.
Cage,
I
do
not
need
to
get
to
know
you.
And
if
you
knew
what
was
good
for
you,
you
wouldn't
want
to
get
to
know
me
either.
It's
the
only
way
you
make
it
through
this
thing.
What
about
Hendricks?
How
do
you
know
that
name?
You
mentioned
him.
That's
not
possible.
Then
how
do
I
know
his
name?
When
did
I
mention
him?
Is
he
why
you
won't
talk
to
me?
Don't
ever
mention
his
name
again.
Why?
Are
you...
in
love
with
him?
And
I
watched
him
die
three
hundred
times,
and
I
remember...
every
detail.
I
remember
everything.
So
I
don't
need
to
talk
about
it.
I'm
sorry.
It's
just
war.



There's
nothing
here.
We
have
to
find
the
keys.
Let's
just
siphon
the
gas.
Oh,
why
drive
when
we
can
fly?
In
that
thing?

Let
me
guess.
I'm
afraid
of
crashing.
And
not
at
all
ashamed
to
admit
it.
You'll
be
fine,
Cage.
You'll
learn.
What
is
it?
It's
nothing.
I'm
fine.
What
is
it?
It's
nothing.
Rita.
Let
me
see.

We
have
to
find
the
keys
to
the
helicopter.
I'm
sure
they're
around
here
somewhere.
You
know
the
Heli's
full
of
fuel,
though.
I
found
a
hose.
We're
flying,
Cage.
Let's
just
say
we
find
the
keys.
You
know?
Get
that
We
don't
have
our
jackets
or
ammunition.
It's
gonna
be
dark
in
a
few
hours.
Might
be
better
off
just
going
back
to
the
farmhouse.
Seeing
what
we
could
salvage.
You
know?
Spend
Come
back
here
in
the
morning.
And
curl
up
by
the
fire
and
open
a
bottle
of
wine.


I
think
we
should
just
reset.
Whoa!
It's
a
dead
end.
Hey,
just--
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you,
I'm
tired.
I'm
in
pain.
I'd
rather
I'll
tell
you
what.
Coffee's
ready.
I'll
That's
productive.
Ten
minutes.
Okay.
And
then
I'm
killing
you.
Fine.

I
can't
believe
you
found
coffee.
Thank
you.
Oh.
Sugar,
right?
Yeah.

Thank
you.
Ah,
hold
on.
Three.
There's
a
shirt
over
there.

RITA:
How
many
times
How
many
times?
Where
are
the
keys?
Where
are
the
goddamn
keys?


You
can
fly
it,
can't
you?
No.
Well,
yes.
I
I'm
still
working
on
my
landing,
so...
What
are
we
still
doing
here?
You're
wasting
time!
Rita,
if
you
start
that
engine
you
die.
This
is
far
as
you
go.
No
matter
what
I
do...
This
is
as
far
as
you
ever
make
it.
There's
a
mimic
buried
twenty
yards
away.
It
attacks
when
you
start
the
engine.
Get
your
weapon
and
get
in
the
helicopter,
Cage.
There's
more
in
the
field
back
there.
Only
one
of
us
ever
makes
it.
Get
in.
The
only
thing
we
haven't
tried
is
the
version
where
you
walk
away.
Just
There's
a
cellar.
There's
food.
You
wait
there
till
I
get
back.
You'll
be
safe.
I'm
a
soldier.
I
volunteered.
I'm
not
walking
away.
You
die
here.
Right
here.

I...
can't
save
you.
And
if
I
go
on
and
kill
the
Omega,
you're
dead.
Forever.
Why
does
it
matter
what
happens
to
me?
I
wish...
I
didn't
know
you...
But
I
do.



My
middle
name...
Is

FARELL:
The
good
news
is
Hope

the
form
of
glorious
combat.
Battle
is
the
great
redeemer,
the
fiery
crucible
in
which
the

The
one
place
where
all
men...
Yes?
Who
said
you
could
talk
to
me?
Have
I
got
something
on
my
face,
soldier?
I'm
sorry
to
disturb
you,
Sergeant.
All
right,
man,
let's
get
this
show
on
the
road.
I
gotta
suit
up.

SKINNER:
Come
on,
Where's
your
helmet?
Never
wear
one.
It's
a
distraction.
Have
you
been
drinking?
I
need
three
more
clips
eight
grenades
and
an
extra
battery.
Get
it.
SKINNER:
'Ey!
Oi,
mate!
I
think
there's
something
wrong
with
your
suit.
There's
a
dead
guy
in
it.
Woo-hoo!
We
made
it!
Thank
god,
we
made
it!
Whoo--!





Finish
it!


It
isn't
there.
What
do
you
mean
the
Omega
isn't
there?
My
guess
is
it
never
was.
They
ambushed
us.
The
visions
were
a
trap.
Just
like
Rita's
visions
were
a
trap
at
Verdun.
It
could
have
killed
me
but
it
didn't.
It's
after
my
blood.
So
they
know
who
you
are.
They--
they
want
their
power
back.
And
they're
gonna
get
it
one
way
or
another.
Unless
we
find
the
Omega.
The--
there
isn't
any
other
way.
No.
We're
not
finished.
That
doesn't
work.
I-I
You
built
a
prototype
yes,
and
I
got
fired
for
it,
thank
you
very
much.
Wh-what
is
this
thing,
anyway?
It's
a
transponder.
You
stick
it
into
the
Alpha,
and
it
taps
into
the
wavelength
That's
the
idea,
anyway.
But
I
can't
get
it
to
work.
Not
with
the
equipment
I
have
on
hand.
How
do
we
get
you
what
you
need?
Well,
that's
the
thing.
I
mean,
when
I
was
at
whitehall
I
built
one.
I
was
even
ready
to
test
it.
When
I
told
my
superiors
about
it...
Well,
I
lost
my
job.
They
thought
he
was
crazy.
So
all
we
need
to
do
is
go
to
Whitehall.
You'd
be
arrested
ten
feet
from
the
front
door.
Psych
ward.
Dissection.
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Aren't
you
The
transponder
requires
a
live
Alpha
to
make
it
work.
We
don't
need
one.

down

better
be
critical.

Critical
enough?
I
don't

I've
had
more
than
my

of
that.
RITA:

down,

very
seriously

were

it
to

left
this
office
today,
I
never
imagined
you'd
be
back,
let
alone
with
my
most
decorated
soldier.
I'm
gonna
tell
ya
a
story,
General.
And,
at
first,
it's
gonna
sound
ridiculous,
but
the
longer
I
talk,
the
more

Tell
him
you'll
call
back.
Tell
who?
Major
General
Beaumont,
calling
from
Halifax.
His
plane
has
just
been
delayed.
Yes.
Thank
you,
Beaumont.
Tomorrow's
invasion
is
a
slaughter.
I'm
dead
within
five
minutes
of
landing
on
that
beach,
along
with
every
other
soldier
you
are
sending.
And
that's
because
the
enemy
knows
we're
coming.
How
do
I
know
this?
I
killed
a
mimic,
only
this
one
was
different.
It
passed
something
on
to
me.
Now
I
live
the
same
day
over
and
over
again.
Just
like
they
do.
Just
like
Sergeant
Vrataski...
At
Verdun.
Tell
your
secretary
everything's
fine.
Beg
your
pardon?
Um,
I'm...
sorry,
General.
It's
fine.
She
typed
up
those
orders
for
you
to
authorize.
But
she
left
out
the
ones
referring
to
the
fuel
dump
at
Greenwich.
Your
name
is
Iris.
Your
birthday
is
September
seventeenth.

General
quietly
pulled
some
strings,
stationed
your
only
son
in
Australia,
as
far
from
the
war
as
possible.
Tell
the
General
his
dinner's
just
been
canceled.
The
call
came
in
just
now.
Your
dinner
was
canceled.
You
forgot
the
fuel
dump.
Thank
you,
Iris.
Cage,
let's
go.
Rita.
Let
me
just--
what
are
we
doing?
Please,
don't
shoot
him
again.
Just--
just--

General,
thi--
this
isn't
the
first
time
we've
That's-that's-because
You
won't
believe
me
when
I
tell
ya
that
Dr.
Carter
was
right.
That
the
enemy
can
manipulate
time.
The
invasion
will
fail.
No
matter
how
many
bodies
you
throw
at
it.
The
only
way
to
win
this
war
is
by
finding
this
power
source
of
the
mimic
horde
and
killing
it.
And
the
only
means
of
finding
it
is
in
that
safe
right
there.
No
matter
how
many
times
we
have
this
conversation...
You
refuse
to
accept
that
the
enemy
breaks
through
to
London
tomorrow
and
we
lose.
We
lose
everything.
Let's
say
for
one
moment...
That
I
can't
rationally
explain...
Your
impressive
parlor
tricks.

Dr.
Carter
told
me...
This
device
requires
a
live
mimic
to
work.
What
use
is
it
to
you?
That's
my
concern.
On
the
contrary.
According
to
you,
this
concerns
the
whole
world.
Well,
what
would
you
do
if
you
believed
everything
I
just
told
you?
I
would
locate
this...
Omega...
and
bomb
it
out
of
existence.
You're
not
mentally
equipped
to
fight
this
thing.
And
you
never
will
be.
What
do

do
now?

don't
know.

was
easy.

it!

happening?

to

going
down.

have
you
done?

be
fine.

don't
know

just
done.

not
allowed

alive?

Vrataski.

Just

me

me.

out
of
those
things
in

minutes

gave

blood.

have
to

less
than
three
hours.

enough

track
of

listen.

gonna
wanna
hear
this

it's
gonna

ridiculous

first,

longer

going

appear.

About

says

angel
of
Verdun.
Okay.
FARELL:
It's
a
new
day,
people.
Destiny
calls.
The
world
expects
only
one
thing
Rest
assured
the
enemy
will
thank
you
for
not
giving
a
hundred
percent
today.
Squad.
Where's
J
squad?
Right,
okay.
So
this
Just
blow
the
new
age
piece
of
bollocks
back
where
it
came
from.
Right,
it-it's
Just
kill
it.
Okay?
No!
You
heard
what
Cage
said.
Do
not
kill
an
Alpha.
If
we
kill
an
Alpha,
the
Omega
will
reset
this
whole
day.
We'll
never
even
remember
we
had
this
conversation.
And
they're
gonna
know
we're
coming.
So
what
am
I
supposed
to
do
if
one
of
those
alphas
is
about
to
kill
me?
You
take
a
hit
for
the
team.
When
we're
on
the
ground...
There's
not
gonna
be
a
lot
of
time
before
they
know
we're
there.
We're
gonna
need
eyes
up
here.
I'm
going
in,
Cage.

Thirty
seconds
till
contact.

Cage!
Oh,
no!
Oh!
Kimmel!
No!


Ford!
Let's
go!
Cage!
Drop,
Nance!
GRIFF:
Talk
to
him,
Rita!
Cage,
they
know
we're
coming,
man!
Drop!
Drop!
Drop!
Drop.
You're
not
hooked
in.




What
took
you
so
long?
Any
others?
SKINNER:
We're
low
on
ammo.
I've
got
one
claymore.
Ford,
you're
out.
Griff
has
only
got
half
a
magazine
left
and
he
can
hardly
move.
I
thought
you
could
see
the
future.
I
haven't
lived
this
day.
I
don't
know
what's
gonna
happen.
RITA:
It
doesn't
matter.
What
matters
is
we
finish
this.
FORD:
With
what?
I
mean,
Griff
can't
even
walk.
We're
three
men
down.
Come
on.
Look.
We're
running
Collect
your
ammo.
SKINNER:
There
must
between
us
and
that
pyramid.
So,
what
we
gonna
do?
Just
walk
up
to
the
front
door?
If
we
stay
here,
we
die.
Yeah?
We'll
never
get
through.
We
could.
In
that.
That
ship
will
never
fly.
Doesn't
need
to
fly.
It
just
needs
to
get
us
across
there
with
speed.
If
the
engines
are
still
running,
we
could
steer
it
with
the
power
levers.
Skinner...
clear
a
path.

RITA:
Try
it
again,
now.
No,
it's
not
reading.
Condition
lever,
low.

Master
power,
on.

Griff!
We've
gotta
go!
Come
on!
I'm
not
gonna
be
any
good
in
there,
mate.
Let
me
buy
you
some
time.

Power's
on.
This
is
gonna
work.
FORD:
Hey!
Hey,
come
on,
man!
We
gotta
go!
SKINNER:
Don't
wait
for
us!
Skinner!
Griff,
come
on!
We're
good
to
go.
Where's
Skinner
and
Griff?
They're
not
comin'.


GRIFF:
Go,
brother.
I'll
see
you
in
the
next
life.
Bollocks.
Move
over!
Move
over!
FORD:
We
gotta
go!
Yo,
we
gotta
go.
Now!
They're
coming,
Cage.
Come
on,
you
bastards!
Come
on!
Reload.
Reload.
Reload.
We
got
incoming!

Come
on!
RITA:
Cage!
You
have
to
take
over!
No!

Rita!
Punch
it!
Punch
it!




We've
been
through
worse.





Okay.
CAGE:
It's
there.
In
the
water.
There.


That's
an
Alpha.
I'm
gonna
draw
that
thing
away.
You
kill
the
Omega.
No.
You
won't
make
it
ten
feet
before
that
thing
kills
you,
Cage.
I
can
do
it.
Take
the
grenades.
I
can
do
it.
Listen
to
me.
Listen
to
me.
Neither
one
of
us
is
getting
out
of
here.

Thank
you...
for
getting
me
this
far.
You're
a
good
man,
Cage.
I
wish
I
had
the
chance
to
know
you
better.










Welcome
to
London,
Major.
I'm
corporal
Montgomery,
your
liaison
to
General
Brigham's
press
office.
Very
good
to
have
you.
Have
you
heard
the
news?
BRIGHAM:
Just
before
A
large
surge
of
energy
was
detected
in
Paris.
We
do
not
know
exactly
what
this
signifies.
But
the
result
appears
to
be
a
total
collapse
of
the
enemy's
capacity
to
fight.
Russian
and
Chinese
troops
are
now
moving
across
Europe
without
resistance.
[
Tomorrow,
we
advance
on
the
western
front.
We
believe
we
are
marching
to
claim
a
victory
for
ourselves...
For
our
loved
ones,
for
our
countrymen,
for
the
entire
human
race.
FARELL:
What
are
you?!
ALL:
I'm
a
warrior!
What
do
warriors
do?!
What
are
you
gonna
do?!
You
have
not
been
in
twenty
battles,
Ford.
I
have
too.
You're
gonna
dump
your
load
the
second
you
hit
the
beach
tomorrow,
Ford.
How
about
you
two
go
get
yourselves
a
nice
hot
cup
of
Ha
ha!
You
funny,
girl.
But
I
bet
you
I
set
some
kind
of
record
tomorrow.
Yeah.
Fastest
time
runnin'
backwards,
Ford,
slippin'
in
your
own
shit.
FARELL:
Knock
off
the
grab-ass!
What
are
you?!
I'm
a
warrior!
What
do
warriors
do?!
MAN:
Attention!
Yes?
What
do
you
want?
