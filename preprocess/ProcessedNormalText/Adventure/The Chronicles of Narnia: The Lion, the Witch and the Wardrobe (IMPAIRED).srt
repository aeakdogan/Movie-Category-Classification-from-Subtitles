I,
too,
want
my
family
safe.
Is
our
little
prince
uncomfortable?
Does
he
want
his
pillow
fluffed?
Special
treatment
for
the
special
boy!
Isn't
that
what
you
wanted?

You
look
like
Mum.
Mum
hasn't
had
a
dress
like
this
We
should
bring
her
one
back.
If
we
ever
get
back.
I'm
sorry
I'm
like
that.
We
used
to
have
fun
together,
didn't
we?
Yes.
Before
you
got
boring.
Oh,
really?

-

Please
don't
try
to
run.
-
We're
tired.

-

-

Get
back!
Peter!
Ah!
Come
on.
We've
already
been
through
this
before.
We
both
know
you
haven't
got
it
in
you.
Peter!
Watch
out!
-


No!
Stay
your
weapons.
You
may
think
you're
a
king,
but
you're
going
to
die...
...like
a
dog!

Peter!

-

He'll
lead
you
to
Edmund.
Peter.
Clean
your
sword.
Rise,
Sir
Peter
Wolf's-Bane,
Knight
of
Narnia.
-

The
minotaurs
will
take
the
left
flanks.
We'll
keep
the
giants
in
reserve
-

-

Ah!
The
prisoner!




You're
not
Not
yet.

We
have
work
to
do.
-


Edmund!
What's
done
is
done.
There
is
no
need
to
speak
to
Edmund
Hello.
-
Are
you
all
right?
Get
some
sleep.
And
Edmund...
...try
not
to
wander
off.
Narnia's
not
going
I'm
sure
they'll
pack
something
up
We're
going
home?
You
are.
I
promised
Mum
I'd
keep
you
three
safe.
But
it
doesn't
mean
But
they
need
us.
All
four
of
us.
Lucy,
it's
too
dangerous.
You
almost
drowned!
Which
is
why
we
have
to
stay.
I've
seen
what
the
White
Witch
can
do.
And
we
can't
leave
these
I
suppose
that's
it
then.
Where
are
you
going?
To
get
in
some
practice.


Come
on,
Ed!
Sword
point
up,
-

En
garde!
-

Hey!
-

-
My
name
is
Philip.

Sorry.
The
Witch
has
demanded
She's
on
her
way
here.
Jadis,
the
Queen
of
Narnia!
Jadis,
the
Queen
of
Narnia!
-

Go
away,
Witch!

You
don't
belong
here!


You
have
a
traitor
in
your
midst,
Aslan.

His
offense
was
not
against
you.
Have
you
forgotten
the
laws
Do
not
cite
the
Deep
Magic
to
me,
Witch.
I
was
there
when
it
was
written.
Then
you'll
remember
well
-
His
blood
is
my
property.
-
Try
and
take
him
then.
Do
you
really
think
that
mere
force
...little
King?
Aslan
knows
that
unless
I
have
blood,
all
of
Narnia
will
be
overturned
and
perish
in
fire
and
water.
That
boy
will
die
-
on
the
Stone
Table...
...as
is
tradition.
You
dare
not
refuse
me.
Enough.
I
shall
talk
with
you
alone.
She
has
renounced
her
claim

How
do
I
know
your
promise
will
be
kept?





-
Susan!

Shouldn't
you
both
be
in
bed?
We
couldn't
sleep.
Please,
Aslan.
Couldn't
we
come
with
you?
I
would
be
glad
of
the
company
Thank
you.
It
is
time.
From
here,
I
must
go
on
alone.
But
Aslan...
You
have
to
trust
me.
Thank
you,
Susan.
Thank
you,
Lucy.
And
farewell.






Behold.
The
great
lion.

-

-

Do
you
want
some
milk?
Why
doesn't
he
fight
back?
-
Bind
him!
Tie
him
up!
Get
him!
-

Let
him
first
be
shaved.

Bring
him
to
me.




You
know,
Aslan,
I'm
a
little
disappointed
in
you.
Did
you
honestly
think
by
all
this
You
are
giving
me
your
life
and
saving
no
one.

So
much
for
love.

Tonight...
...the
Deep
Magic
will
be
appeased!

But
tomorrow,
we
will
take
Narnia
-
forever!
In
that
knowledge,
despair...
...and
die!
-




The
Great
Cat...
...is
dead!

-
General.
-
Prepare
your
troops
for
battle.

However
short
it
may
be.

It's
too
late.
He's
gone.
He
must
have
known
what
he
was
doing.

Get
away!
Get
away,
all
of
you!
No.
Look.
We
have
to
tell
the
others.
-
We
can't
just
leave
him!
They
need
to
know.
The
trees.


Be
still,
my
Princes.
I
bring
grave
news
from
your
sisters.


She's
right.
He's
gone.
Then
you'll
have
to
lead
us.
Peter,
there's
an
army
out
there
-
I
can't.
And
so
do
I.
The
Witch's
army
is
nearing,
sire.

They
come,
Your
Highness,
in
numbers
Numbers
do
not
win
a
battle.
No.
But
I
bet
they
help.




I
have
no
interest
in
prisoners.
Kill
them
all.
-

-

Look
to
the
sky!
-


Are
you
with
me?
To
the
death.
For
Narnia
and
for
Aslan!
Go!
Go!
For
Aslan!
-







We
should
go.
I'm
so
cold.

-

Susan!
Where's
Aslan?
What
have
they
done?

Aslan!

But
we
saw
the
knife.
The
Witch.
If
the
Witch
knew
she
might
have
interpreted
That
when
a
willing
victim
is
killed
in
a
traitor's
stead,
the
Stone
Table
will
crack
and
even
death
itself
We
sent
the
news
that
you
were
dead.
Peter
and
Edmund
will
have
gone
to
war.
We
have
to
help
them.
We
will,
dear
one,
but
not
alone.
Climb
on
my
back.
We
have
far
to
go
And
you
may
want
to
cover
your
ears.


Fire!
Yes!
Fall
back!
Draw
them
to
the
rocks!
-

Where
are
we
going?
Hang
on!
Fall
back!
Go
on,
fall
back!
-


Stop!









Susan,
this
is...
-
Mr.
Tumnus!
Come,
we
must
hurry
Peter
will
need
everyone
we
can
find.
Ah!

Edmund!
There's
too
many!
Get
out
of
here!
Get
the
girls
and
get
them
home!
You
heard
him!
Let's
go!

Peter
said
get
out
of
here!
Peter's
not
king
yet.




Ah!


lmpossible!
Ah!
It
is
finished.
-

Peter!
Where's
Edmund?

-
Edmund!
Ah!

When
are
you
gonna
learn



To
the
glistening
Eastern
Sea,
I
give
you
Queen
Lucy
the
Valiant.

To
the
great
Western
Wood,
King
Edmund
the
Just.
To
the
radiant
Southern
Sun,
Queen
Susan,
the
Gentle.
And
to
the
clear
Northern
Sky,
I
give
you
King
Peter,
the
Magnificent.
Once
a
King
or
Queen
of
Narnia,
always
a
King
or
Queen.
May
your
wisdom
grace
us
until
the
stars
rain
down

Long
live
King
Peter!
Long
live
King
Edmund!
Long
live
Queen
Susan!
Long
live
Queen
Lucy!


Don't
worry.
We'll
see
him
again.
-
When?
One
day
he'll
be
here
But
you
mustn't
press
him.
After
all,
he's
not
a
tame
lion.
No.
But
he
is
good.
Here.
You
need
it
more
than
I
do.

Are
you
all
right,
Philip?
I'm
not
as
young
as
I
once
was.

Come
on,
Ed.
-
Just
catching
my
breath.
-
What
did
he
say,
Susan?
-
I'll
get
the
stag
myself."
What's
this?
It
seems
familiar.
As
if
from
a
dream.
Or
a
dream
of
a
dream.
Spare
Oom.
-
Lucy!
-

Lu?
These
aren't
branches.

Ow!
Ooh!
-
They're
coats.

Peter,
move
off!
-

Stop
shoving.
I'm
not
on
your
toe!


Oh!
There
you
are.
What
were
you
all
You
wouldn't
believe
us
Try
me.

I
don't
think
You
see...
I've
already
tried.
Will
we
ever
go
back?
Oh,
I
expect
so.
But
it'll
probably
happen
All
the
same...

best
to
keep
your
eyes
open.
