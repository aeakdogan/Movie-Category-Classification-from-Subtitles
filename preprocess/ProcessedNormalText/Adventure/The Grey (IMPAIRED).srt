know
You
left

I
can't
get

it
want?
You.
Diaz,

Fuck!
Fuck!
Hey,
Diaz,
Yeah!

You
fuck!
Fuck!
I
think
I

Is
that
the
big
one?
It's
not
the
alpha.
It's
an
omega,
an
outcast.
They
sent
it
in
to
test
you,
Diaz.
Did
I
pass,
bitch?
You
fucking
dog.


Let's
get
a
large
branch,
shove
it
up
We're
gonna

we're
gonna
eat
it.

Hey,

might
be
the
last
meat
It's
gristly,
too.
It
tastes
like
shit,
I
know,
but
It
tastes
like
dog
shit.
And
I'm
much
more
of


Burke?
Yeah?
My
head's
a
Sit
down,
Sit

...feeling
a
little
dizzy.
That's
it.

You
think
they're
Yeah,
they're
watching
us.
You

with
us
You
hear
that?
You're
not
the
animals!
We're

for
that.
Nothing's

Those
things
will
be
all
over
us.
Ottway,

This
will
work.
It's
a
dead
end.
They
can't
get
in
They'll
have
to
hit
us
Let's
build
a
fire.

feet.
This
shit
had
to
save
somebody

keep
Even
with
all
we
hit
the
ground
and
we
made
it.
Why
would
we
go
through
something
if
it
wasn't
meant
to
be,
or
ordained?
BY
Who?
The
Almighty?

heaven?
No,
I'll
tell
you
They're
not.
That's
where.
They're
nowhere.
No,
I
don't
believe
it.
I
do.
I
Wish
I
didn't.
I
really
wish
I
could
This

Emma?
She
was
his
sister.
She
died
My
daughter,
Mary.
She's
got
really
long
hair
In
fact,
it's
the
one
rule
which
is
that
I'm

No

everywhere.
But
he
had
this

Probably
thought
it
rounded
His
way
of
apologizing,
And
there
was
one
