Your
fallback?
Wait
a

You're

Yeah.
Hey,
Nicky,
look
at
me.
Look
at
me,
man.
I
know
that
things
have
been
and
that's
been
hard
for
you.
But
I
really
feel
like
and
when
it
does,
everything's
-
You
know?
and
you're
just
an
ordinary
guy
All
right.
Well
You

what?
All
right?
Come

Let's
get
you
Mr.
Daley,
I
can
honestly
say,
I've
never
seen
Ah,
all
right!
That
wasn't
a
compliment.
It
says
here
you
were
the
C.E.O.
Care
to
elaborate
on
that?
Sure.
Well,
that
was
the
umbrella
You
know,
you
snap,
lights
come
on.
Uh,
didn't
they
already
make
that?
No,
no.
That's
the
Clapper...
which,
obviously,
Personally,
I
don't
really
I
meanYou
know,
whatever.
But,
um,
apparently...
there
is
a
significant
portion
that
has
trouble
actually
snapping.
Clapping's
easier.
Debatable.
I
can't
help
you.
Uh,
Debbie?
'Cause,
uh,
I
felt
a
connection
And
I
don't
know.
I
didn't
feel
a
connection.
Look.
I
need
a
job
tomorrow,
okay?
If
I
don't
have
one
I
just
need
it,
okay?
Well,
I
don't
know.
L
I
might
have
one
thing.
They've
turned

be
small,
metaphorically
speaking.
Don't

the
wrong
way.

26th
president
of
these
Okay.
Uh,
I'm
Larry
Daley,
Pleasure
to
meet
you,
You'll
have
to
excuse
me
though.
Hunt's
afoot.
-
Um,
excuse
me.
Mr.
President,
-
Yes,
but
just
one
question.
Why?
Is
it
like
just
some,
Not
at
all.
Self-reliance
A
man
must
look
inward
to
find
All
right.
Well,
l
I
don't
and
please
don't
take
it
but
isn't
everything
in
this
Dead?
-
Yeah.
Yell
all
you
want,
pharaoh!
You've
been
in
there
54
years!
There's
the
source
The
Tablet
of
Ahkmenrah.
Arrived
here
in
1952
On
that
night...
everything
in
this
museum
And
every
night
since.
So
everything
in
the
museum
Exactly.
And
I'm
supposed
to
do
what?
You're
the
night
watchman,
a
venerable
position
-
Come
on,
lad.
-
This
is
impossible.
If
it
can
be
dreamed,
Hence,
the
20-foot
jackal
staring
at
you
Your
job
is
to
make
sure
that
because
if
the
sun
rises
and
anyone's
-
You
turn
to
dust?
-
Really?
Now
it's
almost
dawn.
But
mark
my
words,
it's
the
last
time
Yeah.
I
mean
I
mean,
I
guess.
I
don't
Um
Stop
babbling,
boy!
Yes
or
no?
-
Yes.
Let's
ride.

All
right.
What
are
you
looking
at?
I'm,
uh,
tracking,
dear
boy.
A
man's
got
to
track.
-
See
you
tomorrow
night.
-
I
don't
think
I'm
coming
back.
-
Yeah.
Well,
this
is
not
exactly
what
l
-
Yeah?
Uh,
well,
I've
done
I,
um
I
invented
this
thing
Did
you
give
up
on
that
as
well?
No.
I
didn't.
-
You
might've
heard
of
the
Clapper.
-
Yes,
sir.
Others
have
greatness
For
you,
this
is
that
very
moment.
Bully!
Gotcha,
boy.
Yeah.
You
got
me.
Say
hello
to
your
little
friend!
-
Hey!
Put
me
down!
-
Just
calm
down,
Jed.
-
It
makes
me
feel
small
and
powerless.
I'm
gonna
shoot
you
In
your
dadgum
eye.
Yeah,
keep
shootin'.
Now
you
know
my
shame.
Jedidiah's
impotent
rage.
His
guns
don't
fire.
This
ain't
over!
Yeah,
I
don't
wanna
hear
it,
okay?
Duck!
The
bigger
they
are,
This
is
not
worth
$11.50
an
hour.
Look,
the
giant's
scared.
Hello!

what
I
say,
you're
gonna
end
up
-
Locked
up.
Take
a
look.
-
Do
they
look
happy?
They
look
sad.
'Cause
they
can't

Now
I'm
letting
you

Good

Lawrence!
Teddy,
this
guy's
been
pushing
me
Poppycock.
This
little
creature
Without
him,
there's
no
us.
Are
you
rabid?
Wipe
that
off.
You

to
deal
with
this
May
I
have

born
great,
Lawrence.
Others
have
greatness
You
hit
me
with
that
The
thing
is,
That's
the
problem.
No,
you're
not,
Lawrence.
For
the
love
Every
great
journey
If
you
could
teach
the
inhabitants
to
get
along,
That
means
a
lot
coming
from
a
guy
spying
on
a
girl
I
was
going
to
make
contact.
I'm
done,
all
right?
No,
Rexy!
No!
Oh,

saw
your
boss

Nicky
has
any
room
He
won't
be
disappointed.
Larry
He
won't
be
disappointed.

big
plans
tonight
or
Yeah.
No,
I'm
not

I
prefer
hanging
out
with
people
It's
the
live
ones

Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.

I
can
handle
it.
You
know
how
they
say
-
Yeah.
it
actually
does.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Everything
-
Really?
-
You
know
that
tablet,
the
Tablet
of
Ahkmenrah?
It
actually
brings
things
to
life.
Since
the
'50s
when
it
came
here,
I
know
this
because
Teddy
Roosevelt
told
me.
Right?
The
cute
little
-
A
capuchin.
He
urinated
on
me
And
Sakagawea
is
in
her
case...
alive
every
night,
just
listening
So
if
you
really
want
I
can
hook
that
up.
-
That's
cool.
Make
fun
of
the
history
geek.
No.
Rebecca!
Good
night,
Larry.
No,
I'm
not
making
fun
of
you.
There
you
go.

What's
going
on?
so
I'm
just
gonna
show
you.
-
What?
-
Okay,
you
like
Tyrannosaurus
rex?
Yeah?
Well,
I
call
him
Rexy.
And
he's

in...
five,
four,
three,
two

Dad?
Say
hello

Rexy!
Dad,

the
Tablet
of
Ahkmenrah,

a
tablet?
Come

Dad.
Come

You
guys
shouldn't
be

Nicky.
We're
not
gonna
hurt
you.
I'm
sorry
to
tell
you
this,
son,
but
Got
fired
this
morning.
Dad,
I
thought
you
said
I

Nicky.
They're
lying.
Just

the
middle
piece.
That
is
museum
property,
son.
Nicky,
trust
me.
Just
turn
it.

Give

the
tablet!
Nicky,
trust
me.
Nick,
run,
now.
Get
back
here,
kid!
Bad
idea,
Larry.
You
wanna
dance,
hot
dog?
Gus,
you're
an
old
man.
Ah!
You
see,
Larry,
the
three
of
us
realized
that,
we
got
new
life
at
night.
Sundown
to
sunrise,
Okay.
Did
not
see
that
coming.
Gave
us
an
energy
boost.
We
love
the
nightlife,
Larry.
So
when
we
found
out
they
were
gonna
Everyone
knows
Add
to
that
the
stuff
Pretty
obvious
you
committed
the
crime.
Come

guys.
Sweet

Let's
get
our
tablet.
Thank
you
very
much.
Nicky!
Just

time,
Larry.
Sleep
tight,
hotshot.
Let's
grab
everything
we
can
fence.
I
don't
know
about
you,
Teddy!
Teddy,
if
you're
out
there,
Someone
call
my
name?
Theodore
Roosevelt
at
your
service.
-
Teddy,
can
you
get
us
out
of
here?
-
This
is
your
moment.
I
didn't
build
the
Panama
Canal.
I
need
some
help!
Come
on!
Actually,
I
never
did
Teddy
Roosevelt
did.
I
was
made
in
a
mannequin
factory
I
never
shot
a
wild
beast.
I'm
not
even
brave
enough
But
you
You
gotta
finish
the
job
this
time.
I'm
made
of
wax,
Larry.

Wait
a
minute!
That's
it.
Come
on.
Duck!
Go
over

you
think
you
could
Thank
you.
Nicky.
Thank
you.
Dad?
You
would
not
believe
How

Don't
worry.
Thank
