Whoo!


Blue

Canyon.
Guidebook
says
four
and
a
half
hours
I
aim
to
take
45
minutes
off
that.

Whoo!






-
Your
face.
-
You
looked
like
a
dog.


-
Hey!
You're
doing
Blue
John
too,
huh?
Uh,
no,
actually.
We're
headed
for
the
dome.
-
But
I
think
we're
lost.
Hang
on.
-
Oh,
my
God.
-

Let's
see
this.
You
are...
here.
-
We
are?
-
Oh,
yeah.
I
knew
that.
I
knew
that.
And
the
dome
is
there.
Oh.
Um,
I
can
take
you
that
way
if
you
like.
Uh-
I’m
sorry.
The,
uh-
Friday
the
13th
there.
Child-killer
look.

I’m
only
a
psychopath
on
weekdays.
And
today's
Saturday,
so-
Can't
take
this
off.
It’s
my
face.

Nice.

-
Aron.
Allow
me
to
introduce
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
-

You're
lost.
I’m
a
guide.
I’m
good.
-

Why
not?
All
right.
This
way.

What
is
that-
like,
20
miles?

-
Oh.
Oh.
I
thought
it
was
17.2.
Uh,
17.3
actually.
Ah,
you're
one
of
those.
I’m
not
one
of
those.
Do
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
out
here?
It’s
my
second
home.
Ah,
see?
There's
the
fork
right
there.
Aah.
Okay,
totally
missed
that.
-
Glad
we
bumped
into
you.

What
are
the
odds,
Exactly.
You
go
to
the
you're
pretty
much
guaranteed
-
and
what
happens?
-

So
the
guidebook
says
But
I
know
a
better
way-
the
cool
way.

Guaranteed
best
time
you
can
have
Although
it's
better
with
your
clothes
off.

It
is
a
bit
of
a
climb.

-
And
a
bit
of
a
squeeze.


and
then
you
tell
us
that
Well,
no.
I’m
an
engineer.
Oh,
that's
wonderful.
I've
always
wanted
to
be

I
don't

that's

what
if
these
things
move?
They've
been
here
for
millions
of
years.
-
Oh,
sure
they
will.
-
Yeah.
Everything's
moving
all
the
time.
Let's
just
hope
not
today.
Oh.
Great.

Crap.


This
is
freaking
me
out,
looking
at
myself.
Sorry.
I
hope
that's
okay.
Uh.
It’s
Monday.
Um.
Bummer,
all
day.
I
tried
to
set
up
this
pulley
all
morning...
but
it
didn't
work.
It
was
worth
a
try.
But
there's
too
much
friction.
And
it's
a
climbing
rope,
What
I
could
really
use...
is
about
20
meters
of
Uh,
three
or
four
pulleys...
a
rack
of
carabiners,
a
sling...
power
drill...
and
bolt
kit.
Oh,
and,
uh,
eight
burly
men
That
should
just
about
do
it.
I
have,
uh...
about
150
milliliters
of
water
left...
which
should
keep
me
alive
if
I’m
lucky.
I
peed
twice.
Almost
pissed
my
pants.
Uh,
I
don't
know,
The
second
time,
I
did
it
in
the
CamelBak.

-

But,
uh,
I’m
sure
it'll
settle.
It’s
got
to
be
chilled
like
sauvignon
blanc.
No
number
twos.
Which
should
disappoint
my
insect
friends.
They'll
just
have
to
wait.
Let's
see,
what
else
could
I
tell
you?
-
Um-
There's
this
raven
that
comes
every
morning.
Hey.
I
clocked
it
at
8:17.
I’ll-
I’ll
film
it
for
you
tomorrow.
Every
morning
at,
uh,
9:30...
I
get
15
minutes
of
sunlight.
It's
really
nice.
I
have
been
chipping
away.
More
to-
More
to
keep
warm
than
anything.
I’m
beginning
to
think
So
when
I
chip
away
a
little
bit...
it
actually
settles
more.
So...
I
found
this
great
tourniquet.

Oh.





It

useful.

question
coming

Utah.
Aron
asks...
Am
I
right
in
thinking...
that
even
if
Brion
from
work...
notifies
the
police...
they'll
put
a
24-hour

means
you

you
see?

do

Now...
is
it
true
that
despite-
or
maybe
because

has

In

me
to
