What's
wrong
with
this?

Jean?
You
okay?
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
It's
just,
uh
It's
not
just
a
headache,
Listen,
but
ever
since
Liberty
Island,
You've
been
different.
My
telepathy's
been
off
lately.
I
can't
seem
to
focus.
A
month
ago,
you
had
to
concentrate
Now,
when
you
have
a
nightmare,
My
dreams
are
getting
worse.
Scott.
I
keep
feeling
something
terrible
I
would
never
let
anything
Hey.
Have
you
guys
Something's
happening
My
brother
asked
you
Yeah,
why
are
you


Hmm.
-
Sorry.
I
can't
help
you
out,
pal.

For
her?
-

I
don't
think
I
think
you're
the
only
one
Hey!
That's
real
cute,
man.

-




I
didn't
do
this.
I
did.
And
the
next
time
you

where
there's
been
Details
are
still
coming
in,
that
the

say
the

I
think
Authorities
have
closed

Yearrgh!
Unh!
My
opinion?
No.
I
don't
While
Eric
is
capable
for
him
It
would
only

If

worse.

you

Well,
we'll
only
know
that
I've
been
trying
to
but
his

When
I
have
Storm,
Jean,
It
was
close,
wasn't
it?
Closer
than
anyone's
admitted.
What
do
you
need,
for
a
special
operation.
Uh,
no,
thank
you,
And
somehow
I
thought
Funny
you
should
say
that,

-
Thank
you
for
having
me.
-
How
do
you
do?
since
before
my
time.
As
I
recall,
It
seems
your
ideas
For
the
best,
So,
what
are
you
proposing,
Uh,
may
I,


We've
managed
to
gather

Where
did
you

one
of
from

Liberty
Island
Eric?
Eric
Lehnsherr?
You
have
access
to
him?
We
developed
the
technology
-
This
facility
is
a
school.
What
the
hell
is
that?
-
What
kind
of
jet?
but
it
comes
up

All
right.
Listen.
William,
you
enter,
but
the
last
thing
is
the
body
of
a
mutant
kid
Mr.
Stryker.
This
is
Yuriko,
Quite
a
handshake.
Uh,
Eric
Lehnsherr's
prison.
It
isn't
a
petting
zoo,
In
this
conflict,
You're
just
a
spectator.
Conflict?
Mr.
Stryker,
I
was
piloting
black-ops
while
you
were
sucking
Don't
lecture
me
This
already
is
a
war.

You're
dead.
You're
so
dead.
II
don't
I'm
not
afraid.
Hey.


Logan!
You
miss
me,
kid?
Not
really.
I'm
okay.
Oh,
this
is
Bobby.
Call
me
Iceman.
Right.
So
how
do
you
guys
Well,
we're
still
Look
who's
come
back.
For
what?
Baby-sitter?
-
Hi,
Logan.
Uh,
I
should
go
Yeah,
well,
Come
on.
-

Storm
and
I
We
won't
be
gone
long.
The
professor
wants
us
So
it
was
a
mutant?
You'll
be
here
unless
you
plan

Find
what
you
were
More
or
less.
I'll
see
you
boys
later.
-
Be
safe,
okay?
-
Bye.
Aren't
you
gonna
Your

needs
gas.
Then
fill
her
up.

Mr.
Laurio.
How
long
How
long
is
your
sentence?
Forever.
Just
until
Mr.
Stryker.
Have
you
come
back
to
make
sure

Ohh!



Done.
You
can
go.
Now...
Mr.
Lehnsherr...
I'd
like
to
have
one
final
talk...
about
the
house
and
the
machine
Logan,
my
tolerance
for
your
smoking

smoking

been

Well,
can't
you

If
I
wanted
to
kill
him,
yes.
There.

Looks
like

I
need
you
Logan...
I'm
afraid
the
results
-
We
had
a
deal.
-
It's
a
beehive
with
a
million
I
have
no
doubt
that
your

are
all
somehow
connected.
But,
Logan...
sometimes
the
mind
needs
to
I
promise
you
we'll
Oh.
If
you
will
be
kind
enough
Scott
and
I
are
going

I'm
sending
Soon
as
you

Let's
hope
Yes.
For
his

just
wanna

you
bored
yet?





-
You
have
him?
Are
you?
Please
don't
kill
me.
Now
why
would

such
fear...
and
then
I
could
see
it
all
happening...
but
I
couldn't
stop
myself.
It
was

bad
dream.
Perhaps
He
is
testing
me.
And
before
you
were

remember?
Nothing.
I
was

I'd
rather

remember
him,

His

Jason,
Yes.
Years
ago.
Unfortunately,
at

not
in
the
way
And
now
you
think
will
make
up
for
your
failure

How
long

here?
And

off

you

It's

It's
just
that
it's
not

you
can't.
You
know,
I've
seen
how
Excuse
me?

I've
put

Logan's

is
still
fragile.
Is
it?
Or
are
you
afraid
of
losing

friend?
Eric,
what
have
you
done?
I'm
sorry,
Charles.
I
couldn't

What
have
you
told

is
that

Mmm.

Uh
Honey,
aren't
you

There's
something
I
need
to
tell
you.


??

Have
a
nice
sleep,
Lehnsherr?
There's
something
different
Yeah.
I
was
having
No.
No,
it's
not
that.
-
Sit
down.

-
What
could
it
be?
What
are
you
doing?
Ahh.
There
it
is.

Mr.

you

you,

What
exactly
are
Art.


I
can
do
a
lot
more
than
that.
-


Oh.
Ronny!
This
is
all
my
fault.
they
discovered
that

so
it's
his
fault.



I
need
the

They
won't
let
us
leave.
but
it's

is
now
underway.

Why
don't
you
take
a
break?
Right.


So,
what
are
they?
They
are
angelic
symbols...
passed
on
to
mankind
They're
beautiful.
One
for
every
sin...
so
quite
a
few.
You
and
Miss
Grey
Yes.
At
a
school
Safe
from
what?
Everyone
else.
You
know,
outside
of
the
circus,
But
I
didn't
hate
them.
Do
you
know
why?
Because
most
people
beyond
what
they
see
Well,
I
gave
up
on
pity
Someone
so
beautiful
Sometimes
anger...
can
help
you
survive.
So
can

Where?

Oh,
it's
for
me.
Bobby...
have
you
tried
No
one's
left,
Jean.
What
about
the
children?
We
haven't
been
able
Where
are
you,
Logan?
-
Okay.
We're
on
our
way.
We
have
to
go
now.
Now!
Drop
the
knives
-


Open
the
door!

-
Up
against
the
wall.
This
is
just
I
can't.
Look.
-
Oh!
All
right,
the
rest
of
you,
Look,
kid,

You
know
I'm
the
worst
one.

Look
out!

Who
the

is
this?
But
in
the
Munich

-
Aw,
save
it.
Storm?

Jason,
stop
it!


-

You
can
come
out.
Yes.
-
Where
are
all
the
other
students?
Well,
then,
we'll
have
to
We'll
use
Cerebro.
Come
on.
How
far
are
we?
We're
actually
coming
up
I've
got
two
signals
approaching.
Coming
in
fast.

Return
with
our
escort
-
Wow.
Somebody's
angry.

We
are
coming
up
Lower
your
altitude
now.
Repeat,
lower
your
altitude
to
20,000
feet.
They're
falling
back.


-
What?


-
Please
don't
do
that
again.
Don't
we
have

warning,
warning,
Warning,
warning,
warning,
Warning,
warning,

Everybody
okay
back
there?

Oh,
my
God.
There's
one
more.
Jean

-

-
No!
-
Jean?

When
will
these
people

Thank
you.
-
Can
you
hear
His
name
is
and
he
invaded
your
mansion
He
wanted
Cerebro.
Or
enough
of
it
But
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Which
I
think
is
the
only
reason
Oh,
my
God.
Now,
what
are
you
all
so
afraid
of?
While
Cerebro
is
working,
to
every
living
person
If
he
were
forced
to
let's
say,
mutants,
-
he
could
kill
us
all.
How
would
Stryker
even
know
Because
I
told
him.
I
helped
Charles
build
it,
Mr.
Stryker
has
Even
against
a
mutant
So
who's
this
He
spent
his
whole
life
If
you
want
You
don't
remember,
William
Stryker,
the
only
The
metal
on
your
bones.
-
But
the
professor-
you
were
smart
enough
to
He
gives
you
more
credit
-
Why
do
you
need
us?
that
Stryker's
been
We
know
that's
where
but
we
don't
know
and
I
believe
-
The
professor
already
tried.
Oh...
hello.
I
didn't
mean
to
snoop.

Stryker's
at
Alkali
Lake.

There's
nothing
left

Hey.
You
okay?
Yeah.
How
we
doing?
It'll
take
four
or
five
hours
before
That's
not
what
I
meant.
I'm
just
worried
That
was
some
display
Obviously,
it
wasn't
enough.
I
love
him.
Do
you?
Girls
flirt
with
they
don't
take
him
home.
They
marry
the
good
guy.
I
could
be
the
good
guy.
Logan,
the
good
guy

Don't
make
me
This.
Excuse
me.
They
say
you
can

Then
why
not
You
know,
Because
Look
No
one's
ever
left
a
scar
What
do
you
want,
You
know
what
I
want.
But
what
do
you
want?
What
do
you
really
want?
I
want
you
to
get
out.
Jesus.
Why
don't
we
get
uniforms?
They're
on
order.

We
love
what
you've
done
Hey,
hey.
So,
they
say

That's
a
dorky-looking
This
dorky-looking
helmet
from
the
real
bad
guys.
-
What's
your
name?
What's
your
real
name,
Pyro.
Quite
a
talent
I
can
only
manipulate
I
can't
create
it.
You
are
a
god
among
insects.
Never
let
anyone
tell
you
different.
Sir,
the
machine
Good.

If
I
may
ask,
sir,
why
are
we
I'm
a
scientist,
When
I
build
a
machine,
All
right,
this
is
This
is
the
spillway.
You
see
these
They're
tire
tracks.
Mm-hmm.
And
this
Now,
this
is
recent
If
we
go
in
there,

No.
I
have
to
be
able
otherwise
I
could
I'll
go.
I
have
a
hunch
Wolverine,
whoever
goes
into
What
do
you
intend
to
do?
Scratch
it
with
your
claws?
I'll
take
my
chances.

Can

Come.
There's

Will
you
be
all
right
without

Where's

lover's
quarrel

Get
us
out
of
here!
-


Scott,
don't
do
this!

It's
okay.
It's
me.
Scott.
I
thought
I'd
lost
you.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
could
see
you,
I
tried.
I
love
you.

Scott...
something's
wrong.
My
God.
No!


I'm
trying.

Concentrate.

The
tricky
thing
about

if
you

liquid
form,
Keep
it
hot.
Because
once
the
metal
cools,
But
you
already
I
used
to
think
you
were
I
was
wrong.

Holy
shit.





That's
it.
Whoa.
Where
do
you
I'm
sick
of
this
kid's
table
shit.

You
always
do
as
you're
told?





Find
them.
Find
all
the
mutants.
Good.




Now,
find
them
all.
You,
concentrate
harder.
Kill

We're

That's

Why
did
you
come
back?
You
make
it
sound
as
if
As
I
recall,
Who
am
I?

just
a
failed
experiment.

If
you
really
knew
what
kind
of
person
you
were...
the
work
we
did
together-
People
don't
change,
You
were
an
animal
then.
I
just
gave
you
claws.




What
the
hell
is
that?
The
dam's
ruptured.
It's
trying
to
relieve
the
pressure.
In
a
few
minutes,
Come
with
me,
and
I'll
tell
you
You
can't
help
your
friends.
You're
a
survivor,
Oh,
I
thought
If
we
die,
you
die.

Aaah!
There
are
no
exits
that
way,
Wolverine!

Impossible.

Wait.
Kurt,

Storm,
who
is
this
guy?
but
in
the
Munich
circus
I
told
you,
if
I
can't
see
I
have
faith
in
you.
Don't
believe
Our
Father,
Thy
kingdom
come,

Hello.
What
are
you
looking
for?
Professor,
can
you
hear
me?
-
You've
got
to
stop
Cerebro
now.
No.
Don't
move.
But
she's
just
a
little
girl.
No,
she's
not.
I've
got
my
eyes
on
you.
Mr.
Stryker.
Funny,
we
keep
Mark
my
words,

Kurt,
it's
about
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
What
are
you
doing?


Every
single
one.
Focus.
Focus.

-
Stop
it!
[Voices
Continue,
Jason.





You
don't
want
to
go

Come
on.
The
helicopter



I
will
take
him.

It's
okay,
Rogue.
It's
okay.
-
Let
go.
You
sure?
Who
has
the
answers,
Those
people?
That
creature
Huh?

I'll
take
my
chances
with
him.
One
day,
someone
will
finish
One
day!
Scott,
we've
got
to
I
fear
this
has
gone
beyond
Alkali
Lake.
Bobby.
You
okay?
I
am
now.
-
What's
wrong?

-
Has
anyone
seen
John?
Where
the
hell
He's
with
Magneto.

They're
functioning,

-

Come
on!





-
Which
part?

[Dialogue
Continues,

-
Jean?
She's
outside.
No,
we're
not
leaving!

I
can't.


You,
get
her,
now!
Damn
it!
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
-
This
is
Jean,
listen
to
me.
Don't
do
this.
-

Oh,
no!
No!
She's
gone.
-
She's
gone.
We
gotta
go
back.
No!
No.


She's
gone.
She's
gone.
The
Lord
is
my
shepherd.
He
maketh
me
to
lie
down
Yea,
though
I
walk
through
I
will
fear
no
evil...
for
thou
art
with
me.
Today
I've
been
given
from
the
attack
that
Good
morning
to
nearly
annihilating
-
Good
morning.
Do
we
like
Good
morning.

Thank
you.
Mr.
President,
My
fellow
Americans,
we
are
being
offered
a
moment
and
take
a
unique
role

Did
we
just
lose
the
feed?


Good
morning,
Mr.
President.
Please,
don't
be
alarmed.
-
Who
are
you
people?
My
name
is
Charles
Xavier.
-
I'd
rather
stand.
These
files
were
taken
How
did
you
get
this?
Well,
let's
just
say
I
know
a
little
girl
I've
never
seen
Then
you
also
know
Mr.
President,
this
is
not
a
threat.
There
are
forces
in
this
world,
who
believe
that
a
war
is
coming.
You
will
see
from
those
files
and
there
have
been
casualties.
Losses
on
both
sides.
Mr.
President...
what
you
were
about
to
A
moment
to
repeat
or
to
work
together
We're
here
to
stay,
Mr.
President.
We'll
be
watching.

You
know...
even
when
Jean
she
was
always
hesitant
Always
looking
to
others.
Feeling
that
in
some
way
Do
you
think
Could
we
have
done
In
the
past,
she
may
have
let
us.
There
had
to
be
another
way.
Why
did
she
leave
the
plane?
Because
she
made
a
choice.
-

Hey,
hey.
Listen,
she
did
make
a
choice.
It
was
you.

Is
everything
all
right?
Yes,
I
think
it
will
be.
Now,
tell
me,
have
any
by
an
English
novelist
called
The
Once
and
Future
King?
No?
Well


It
is
the
key
It
is
how
we
have
evolved
from
into
the
dominant
species
This
process
is
slow...
normally
taking
thousands
But
every
evolution
leaps
forward.
