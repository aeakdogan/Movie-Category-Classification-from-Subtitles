in

There
was
a
mighty
duel.
It
ranged
all
over.
Who
won?
How
did
it
end?
The
loser
ran
off
alone,
but
the
winner
followed
those
footprints

track

The

is
nothing.
Clearly,
this
was

planned
We
must
all
be

Could
this
be
a

I
always
think
which
is
why
I'm
still
alive.
So,
it
is
down
to
you
and
it
is
down
to
me.
If
you
wish
her
dead,
Let
me
explain.
There's
nothing
to
explain.
You're
trying
to

an
arrangement

will
be

there
can

All
right.
The
battle
of
wits
It
ends

you
decide,

is

it's
so
simple.
All
I
have
to
do
is

the
sort
of
man
who
would
put

a
clever
man

great
fool,

you
must
have
known

would've

You're
just
stalling
now.
You'd
like
to
think
that,

so
you
could've

on
your
strength
so
I
can

But
you've
also
bested
and
in

so
you
would've

poison
so
I
can
clearly
not
choose
You're
trying
to
trick
me
It
has
worked!
I
know
where
the
poison
is.

make
your
choice.
I
will,
and
I
choose...

in

What?
Where?
I
don't
see
anything.
I
could've
sworn
No

What's
so
funny?
I'll
tell
you
in

you
were
clever
enough
so
in
the

Westley,
what
about
Rodents
of
Unusual
Size?
I
don't
think
they
exist.



Westley!




We
did
it.
Now,
was
that
so
terrible?

Surrender.
You
mean,
you
wish
Very
well.
I
accept.
I
give
you
Don't
make
yourself
a
fool.
But
how
will
you
capture
us?
We
know
the
secrets
We
can
live
there
so
whenever
HUMPERDINCK:
WESTLEY:
For
the
last
time,
surrender!
Death
first!
Will
you
promise
What
was
that?
If
we
surrender,
will
you
promise
May
I
live
a
thousand
years
He
is

Promise
to
return
him
I
swear
it
will
be
done.
Once
we
are
out

take
him
back
to
Florin
I
swear
it
will
be
done.
I
thought
you
were
dead

I
could
not
bear
it
Come,
sir.
We
must
get
you
to
your

We
are
men
of
action.
Well
spoken,
sir.
What
is
it?
You
have
six
fingers
Someone
was
looking
for
you.
Where
am
I?

The
Pit
of
Despair.
Don't
even
think...


Don't
even
think
And
don't
dream
Only
the
Prince,
Then
I'm
here
till
I
die?
Till
they
kill
you,
yeah.
Then
why
bother
curing
me?
The
Prince
and
the
Count
on
everyone
being
healthy
So,
it's
to
be
torture?
I
can
cope
with
torture.
You
don't
believe

I'm
telling
you,
Now,

Do
you

Yes.
"At
noon,
My

final
words
were,
"Love

there

I

It
comes
to

Where
did
