See
the
crows?
They
never
tasted
prince
before.
Is
this
what
you
left
me
for?!
Fight!
Fight
me!
You
coward!
Fight
me!
We
have
a
pact!
Fight!
Fight
him,
son.
Fight
him.
-
Fight
me!
Prepare
for
battle!
This
is
not
honor!
This
is
not
worthy
of
royalty!
If
he
doesn't
fight,
Troy
is
doomed.
The
fight
is
over.
The
fight
is
not
over.
Stand
back,
Prince
Hector.
I'll
kill
him
at
your
feet.
I
don't
care.
He
is
my
brother.
Paris!
Go!
Get
inside,
Paris!
Archers!
-
Our
men
are
too
close
to
the
walls.
For
Troy!
-
Now!
Get
them
in
line!
Get
the
men
back
into
lines!
Front
line,
push!
Forward.
Forward!
Forward!
Apollonians!
Now!
Prince
Hector!
We
need
to
retreat!
My
army's
never
lost
a
battle
yet!
You
won't
have
an
army
Back
to
the
ships!
-
Back
to
the
ships!
-
Back!
Go
back!
Back.
Back
to
the
ships!
Fall
back!
-
Men,
fall
back!
Halt!
But
we
have
them
on
the
run!
We're
in
range
of
their
archers.
Have
our
men
gather
our
fallen.
Send
an
emissary
to
them.
Would
they
have
done
the
same
for
us?
Go!
Back!
Fall
back
into
line!
You
think
I'm
a
coward.
I
am
a
coward.
I
knew
he
would
kill
me.
You
were
watching.
My
father.
My
brother.
All
of
Troy.
Shame
didn't
matter.
I
gave
up
my
pride...
...my
honor...
...just
to
live.
For
love.
You
challenged
a
great
warrior.
I
betrayed
you.
Menelaus
was
a
brave
man.
He
lived
for
fighting.
And
every
day
I
was
with
him,
I
wanted
I
don't
want
a
hero,
my
love.
They're
laughing
at
me
in
Troy.
They
think
I'll
sail
home
at
first
light.
Maybe
we
should.
Flee?
Like
a
whipped
dog?
The
men
believe
we
came
here
Won't
be
needing
her
anymore.
My
brother's
blood
still
wets
the
sand,
It's
no
insult
to
say
a
dead
man
is
dead.
If
we
leave
now,
we
lose
all
credibility.
The
Trojans
can
beat
us
so
easily.
If
we
stay,
we
stay
here
To
protect
Greece,
not
your
pride.
Your
private
battle
with
Achilles
Achilles
is
one
man.
Hector
is
one
man.
Look
what
he
did
to
us
today.
Hector
fights
for
his
country!
I
don't
care
about
the
man's
allegiance.
He's
right.
The
men's
morale
is
weak.
Even
if
I
could
make
peace
with
Achilles,
He's
as
likely
to
spear
me
I'll
talk
to
him.
He'll
want
the
girl
back.
He
can
have
that
damn
girl.
I
haven't
touched
her.
Where
is
she?
I
gave
her
to
the
men.
They
need
some
amusement
after
today.
Come
on,
give
the
bitch
to
me!
Who's
first?
Trojan
whore!
What's
this?
A
virgin's
robe?
-
You
won't
be
needing
that
much
longer!
Better
to
be
a
Spartan
slave
Achilles!
Are
you
hurt?
I
watched
you
fight
them.
To
fight
back
when
people
attack
me?
Eat.
I've
known
men
like
you
my
whole
life.
No,
you
haven't.
You
think
you're
so
different
Soldiers
understand
nothing
but
war.
-
And
you
hate
these
soldiers.
Trojan
soldiers
died
trying
to
protect
you.
Perhaps
they
deserve
Why
did
you
choose
this
life?
-
What
life?
I
chose
nothing.
I
was
born,
And
you?
Why
did
you
choose
I
think
you'll
find
the
romance
one-sided.
Do
you
enjoy
provoking
me?
You've
dedicated
your
life
to
the
gods.
Zeus,
god
of
thunder.
Athena,
-
Yes,
of
course.
Who
blankets
his
bed
with
the
skin
All
the
gods
are
to
be
feared
I'll
tell
you
a
secret...
...something
they
don't
teach
you
The
gods
envy
us.
They
envy
us
because
we're
mortal.
Because
any
moment
might
be
our
last.
Everything's
more
beautiful
You
will
never
be
lovelier
We
will
never
be
here
again.
I
thought
you
were
a
dumb
brute.
I
could
have
forgiven
a
dumb
brute.
Do
it.
Nothing
is
easier.
Aren't
you
afraid?
Everyone
dies.
Today
or
50
years
Do
it.
You'll
kill
more
men
if
I
don't
kill
you.
Many.
My
lord,
there's...
Tell
the
men
to
start
loading
the
ship.
Gather
the
stores.
Agamemnon
is
a
proud
man.
But
he
knows
The
man
sends
you
What
are
you
doing
enthralled
The
world
seems
simple
to
you,
...but
when
you're
a
king,
Ithaca
cannot
afford
an
enemy
Are
we
supposed
to
fear
him?
You
don't
fear
anyone.
We
need
you
back.
Greece
needs
you.
Greece
got
along
fine
before
I
was
born.
Greece
will
be
Greece
I'm
not
talking
about
the
land.
The
men
need
you.
Stay,
Achilles.
You
were
born
for
this
war.
Things
are
less
simple
today.
Women
have
a
way
Of
all
the
kings
of
Greece,
But
in
this
war,
you're
a
servant.
Sometimes
you
have
to
serve
I
hope
you
understand
that
one
day.
We're
going
home?
We
sail
in
the
morning.
Greeks
are
being
slaughtered.
If
it's
fighting
you
still
long
for,
These
are
our
countrymen.
You
betray
all
of
Greece
Someone
has
to
lose.
The
gods
favor
our
cause.
Now
is
the
time
to
destroy
Their
morale
is
battered.
Hit
them
now.
Hit
them
hard.
And
they
will
run.
The
Myrmidons
didn't
fight
yesterday.
There
must
be
dissension
But
if
we
attack
their
ships,
If
they
decide
to
attack
us,
let
them.
Our
walls
can't
be
breached.
Yesterday,
the
Greeks
We
should
not
return
the
favor.
You're
confident
about
the
meaning
The
desecration
of
his
temple
The
gods
have
cursed
the
Greeks.
Prepare
the
army.
Am
I
still
your
captive?
You're
my
guest.
In
Troy,
guests
can
leave
You
should
leave
then.
Would
you
leave
this
all
behind?
Would
you
leave
Troy?
Hold
those
barricades!
Archers
to
the
rear.
Achilles.
Achilles.
Now!
Forward!
Enough
for
one
day.
Yes.
Back
to
the
ships!
Back
to
the
ships!
It
was
his
cousin.
To
Troy!
-
Back
to
the
city!
To
Troy!
We
were
going
to
sail
home
today.
I
don't
think
anyone's
sailing
home
now.
Achilles.
You
violated
my
command.
No,
my
lord.
There
was
a
mistake.
I
ordered
the
Myrmidons
to
stand
down.
You
led
them
into
combat.
I
didn't
lead
them,
my
lord.
Where's
Patroclus?
Patroclus!
We
thought
he
was
you,
my
lord.
He
wore
your
armor,
your
shield,
He
even
moved
like
you.
Where
is
he?
-
Where?
Hector
cut
his
throat.
Don't!
Where
are
you
taking
me?
Do
you
remember
how
to
get
here?
Yes.
The
next
time
you
come
here,
There
are
no
turns,
so
you
can't
get
lost.
When
you
get
to
the
end,
Follow
the
river
until
you
get
Why
are
you
telling
me
this?
-
lf
I
die...
...I
don't
know
how
long
If
the
Greeks
get
inside
the
walls,
They'll
kill
all
the
men,
throw
-
Please.
-
That,
for
you,
will
be
worse
than
dying.
Because
I
want
you
to
be
ready.
I
want
you
to
get
our
boy,
You
save
as
many
people
as
you
can,
I
killed
a
boy
today.
And
he
was
young.
He
was
much
too
young.
That
boy
has
just
saved
this
war
for
us.
-
Eudorus.
I
need
my
armor.
No.
Don't
go!
Rope!
Hector's
my
cousin.
He's
a
good
man.
Don't
fight
him.
Please
don't
fight
him.
Please.
No.
Hector!
Hector!
Hector!
Hector!
Father...
...forgive
me
for
any
offenses.
I've
served
you
as
best
as
I
could.
Hector!
May
the
gods
be
with
you.
Hector.
No
father
ever
had
a
better
son.
Hector!
Apollo
guard
you,
my
prince.
You're
the
best
man
I
know.
You're
a
prince
of
Troy.
I
know
you'll
make
me
proud.
Hector!
Remember
what
I
told
you.
You
don't
have
to
go.
You
don't.
You
remember
what
I
told
you.
Hector!
Hector!
I've
seen
this
moment
in
my
dreams.
I'll
make
a
pact
with
you.
With
the
gods
as
our
witnesses...
...let
us
pledge
that
the
winner
will
allow
There
are
no
pacts
Now
you
know
who
you're
fighting.
I
thought
it
was
you
And
I
wish
it
had
been
you.
But
I
gave
You
gave
him
the
honor
of
your
sword.
You
won't
have
eyes
tonight.
You'll
wander
the
underworld,
blind,
deaf,
This
is
Hector,
the
fool
who
thought
Get
up,
prince
of
Troy.
Get
up.
I
won't
let
You
lost
your
cousin.
Now
you've
taken
mine.
When
does
it
end?
It
never
ends.
Who
are
you?
I
have
endured
what
no
one
I
kissed
the
hands
of
the
man
Priam?
How
did
you
get
in
here?
I
know
my
own
country
better
You're
a
brave
man.
I
could
have
your
head
on
a
spit
Do
you
really
think
death
I
watched
my
eldest
son
die...
...watched
you
drag
his
body
Give
him
back
to
me.
He
deserves
the
honor
of
a
proper
burial.
Give
him
to
me.
He
killed
my
cousin.
He
thought
it
was
you.
How
many
cousins
have
you
killed?
How
many
sons
and
fathers
How
many,
brave
Achilles?
I
knew
your
father.
He
died
before
his
time.
But
he
was
lucky
not
to
live
long
enough
You
have
taken
everything
from
me.
My
eldest
son...
...heir
to
my
throne...
...defender
of
my
kingdom.
I
cannot
change
what
happened.
But
give
me
this
small
mercy.
I
loved
my
boy
from
the
moment
...till
the
moment
you
closed
them.
Let
me
wash
his
body.
Let
me
say
the
prayers.
Let
me
place
two
coins
on
his
eyes
If
I
let
you
walk
out
of
here...
...if
I
let
you
take
him...
...it
doesn't
change
anything.
You're
still
my
enemy
in
the
morning.
You're
still
my
enemy
tonight.
But
even
enemies
can
show
respect.
I
admire
your
courage.
Meet
me
outside
in
a
moment.
We'll
meet
again
soon,
my
brother.
Your
son
was
the
best
I've
fought.
In
my
country,
the
funeral
games
It
is
the
same
in
my
country.
Then
the
prince
will
have
that
honor.
No
Greek
will
attack
Troy
for
12
days.
Briseis?
I
thought
you
were
dead.
You
are
free.
If
I
hurt
you...
...it's
not
what
I
wanted.
Go.
No
one
will
stop
you.
Come,
my
girl.
You're
a
far
better
king
than
the
one
Achilles
makes
a
secret
pact,
and
I
Consorting
with
the
enemy
king.
Peace!
Their
prince
is
dead.
This
is
the
time
to
attack!
Even
with
Hector
gone,
we
have
I
will
smash
their
walls
to
the
ground...
...if
it
costs
me
40,000
Greeks.
Hear
me,
Zeus!
I
will
smash
their
walls
to
the
ground.
That's
good.
For
my
son
back
home.
Well,
Odysseus.
You
found
a
way
to
make
the
sheep
Forgive
me,
Eudorus.
You've
been
a
loyal
friend
all
your
life.
I
hope
I
never
disappoint
you
again.
It's
I
who
have
been
the
disappointment.
Rouse
the
men.
Aren't
you
coming
with
us?
I
have
my
own
battle
to
fight.
Let
me
march
beside
you.
No.
I
don't
want
our
men
It's
a
beautiful
night.
Go,
Eudorus.
Fighting
for
you
has
been
Open
the
gates!
Here.
Plague.
Don't
go
too
close,
my
king.
This
is
the
will
of
the
gods.
They
desecrated
the
temple
of
Apollo...
...and
Apollo
desecrated
their
flesh.
They
thought
they
could
come
here
Now
look
at
them,
What
is
this?
An
offering
to
Poseidon.
The
Greeks
This
is
a
gift.
We
should
take
it
-
I
think
we
should
burn
it.
My
prince,
it's
a
gift
to
the
gods.
Father,
burn
it.
Look
at
them.
You'd
think
their
prince
had
never
died.
You
are
the
prince
now.
Make
your
brother
proud.
Briseis.
Where
is
she?
-
Where?
Please.
I
have
a
son.
Then
get
him
out
of
Troy.
Briseis!
Paris!
Andromache!
Helen.
We
must
go.
-
Where?
Paris.
It's
a
long
way.
Quick.
We
must
go
now.
Briseis!
Paris!
Let
it
burn!
Let
Troy
burn!
Burn
it!
Burn
it
all!
Burn
Troy!
Burn
Troy!
It's
a
long
way.
Quick.
-
Come.
-
No.
I
can't
leave
him.
The
city
is
dead.
-
What's
your
name?
-
Do
you
know
how
to
use
a
sword?
The
sword
of
Troy.
As
long
as
it's
in
the
hands
of
a
Trojan,
Protect
them,
Aeneas.
-
I
will.
Paris,
Briseis
wasn't
in
her
room.
I'll
find
her.
Go.
-
I'll
stay
with
you.
Please
don't
leave
me.
How
could
you
love
me
if
I
ran
now?
We
will
be
together
again,
in
this
world
Go.
To
the
gate!
Soldiers
of
Troy...
...you
men
are
warriors!
To
lead
you
has
been
my
honor!
My
prince!
The
boatman
waits
for
us.
I
say
we
make
him
wait
a
little
longer!
Paris!
Paris!
Have
you
no
honor?
Have
you
no
honor?
Too
late
for
prayer,
priestess.
I
almost
lost
this
war
You'll
be
my
slave
in
Mycenae.
A
Trojan
priestess
scrubbing
my
floors.
And
at
night...
Get
up!
Hold
her.
Come
with
me.
No!
Paris!
No!
Stop!
Please!
Paris!
Don't!
It's
all
right.
It's
all
right.
You
gave
me
peace...
...in
a
lifetime
of
war.
Briseis,
come.
Go.
You
must.
No.
Troy
is
falling.
Go.
We
must
go.
I
know
a
way
out.
It's
all
right.
Go.
Briseis,
come.
Go.
Find
peace...
...my
brother.
If
they
ever
tell
my
story,
let
them
say...
...I
walked
with
giants.
Men
rise
and
fall
like
the
winter
wheat...
...but
these
names
will
never
die.
Let
them
say
I
lived
...tamer
of
horses.
Let
them
say...
...I
lived
in
the
time
of
Achilles.
