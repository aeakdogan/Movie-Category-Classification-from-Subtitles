There
are
some
fish
It's
not
that
they're
faster
They're
just
touched
One
such
fish
was
The
Beast.
And
by
the
time
I
was
born
He'd
passed
up
more
$
100
lures
Some
said
that
fish
was
...who'd
drowned
in
that
river
Others
claimed
he
was
a
dinosaur
I
didn't
put
any
stock
into
All
I
knew
was
I'd
been
trying
...since
I
was
a
boy
And
on
the
day
you
were
born...
Well,
that
was
the
day
Now,
I'd
tried
everything
on
it:
Worms,
lures,
peanut
butter,
But
on
that
day
I
had
a
revelation:
If
that
fish
was
Henry
Walls'
ghost,
I
was
gonna
have
to
use
something
-
Your
finger?
Now,
I
tied
my
ring
onto
...strong
enough
to
hold
up
a
bridge,
And
then
I
cast
upriver.
The
Beast
jumped
up
and
grabbed
it
And
just
as
fast,
Well,
you
can
see
my
predicament.
My
wedding
ring,
...soon
to
be
mother
of
my
child...
...was
now
lost
in
the
gut
What
did
you
do?
I
followed
that
fish
upriver
This
fish,
The
Beast...
...the
whole
time
we
were
calling
it
It
was
fat
with
eggs
Now,
I
was
in
a
situation.
I
could
gut
that
fish
...but
in
doing
so
I'd
be
killing
the
Did
I
want
to
deprive
...to
catch
a
fish
like
this
This
ladyfish
and
I...
-
Well,
we
had
the
same
destiny.
Now,
you
may
well
ask...
Oh,
darling,
darling,
...why
did
it
strike
so
quick
on
gold
That
was
the
lesson
...the
day
my
son
was
born.
Sometimes
the
only
way
to
catch
...is
to
offer
her
a
wedding
ring.
What,
a
father's
not
allowed
I'm
a
footnote
in
that
story,
Dad...
...the
context
for
your
great
adventure,
You
were
selling
novelty
products
Come
on,
Will.
They
don't.
I
don't
love
that
story.
Not
I
know
every
punch
line,
Dad.
For
one
night,
...the
universe
did
not
revolve
-
How
can
you
not
understand
that?
You're
embarrassing
yourself,
Dad.
After
that
night,
I
didn't
speak
William
Bloom,
United
Press
We
communicated
indirectly,
I
guess.
In
her
letters
and
Christmas
cards,
And
when
I'd
call,
she'd
say
Dad
was
True
to
form,
we
never
The
truth
is,
I
didn't
see
anything
And
I
don't
think
he
saw
anything
We
were
like
strangers
In
telling
the
story
...it's
impossible
to
separate
fact
The
best
I
can
do
It
doesn't
always
make
sense,
Give
me
back
my
ring!
Thank
you!
But
that's
what
kind
of
story
this
is.
His
birth
would
set
the
pace
No
longer
than
most
men's,
And
as
strange
as
his
stories
got...
...the
endings
were
always
Yes.
Yes,
he's
here.
It's
your
mother.
And
what
does
Dr.
Bennett
say?
No,
sure,
I'll
talk
to
him.
Yeah,
I'll
wait.
It's
bad?
Yeah,
it's
more
than
they
thought.
-
You
need
to
go.
-
I'm
going
with
you.
I'm
going
with
you.
Now,
which
one's
it
gonna
be?
"Monkey
in
a
Barn,"
The
one
about
the
witch.
The
one
about
the
witch.

Your
momma
says
I
can't
-
You
get
nightmares.
Well,
neither
was
I,
at
first.
Now,
this
took
place
Children
weren't
allowed
in
the
swamp
...and
quicksand
that
would
swallow
There
were
five
of
us
Me,
Ruthie,
Wilbur
Freely...
...and
the
Price
Brothers,
And
not
one
of
us
knew
It's
common
knowledge
that
most
...if
only
to
eat
...and
the
occasional
puppy
Witches
use
those
bones
...and
make
the
land
infertile.
-
Is
it
true
she
got
a
glass
eye?
-
What's
a
gypsy?
Your
momma's
a
bitch.
You
shouldn't
swear.
-
Shit.
Screw.
Turn
off
your
flashlights.
Yet
of
all
the
witches
in
Alabama...
...there
was
one
who
was
said
For
she
had
one
glass
eye
which
I
heard
if
you
look
right
at
it,
That's
bull-S-H-l-T,
that
is.
If
you're
so
sure,
go
get
that
eye.
I
heard
she
keeps
it
in
a
box
on
her
I'll
go
in
right
now
and
get
that
eye.
-
Then
do
it.
-
Fine,
you
do
it.
Edward,
don't!
She'll
make
soap
out
of
you.
She
makes
soap
out
of
people.
Ma'am,
my
name
is
Edward
Bloom...
...and
there's
some
folks
-
You
get
The
Eye?
Let's
see
it.
Whoa,
help!
I
saw
how
I
was
gonna
die.
I
wasn't
old
at
all.
I
was
thinking
about
death
and
all.
I
mean,
on
one
hand,
...it
could
kind
of
screw
you
up.
But
it
could
kind
of
help
you,
Because,
everything
else,
I
guess
I'm
saying
I'd
like
to
know.
That's
how
I
go.
Hi,
Mom.
-
Is
that
Dr.
Bennett's
car?
-
And
how
is
he?
He's
impossible.
He
won't
eat.
Because
he's
weak,
-
How
much
time
does
he
have
left?
Not
yet.
Will.
Dr.
Bennett.
Oh,
it's
good
to
see
you.
My
wife,
Josephine.
A
pleasure.
-
You're
seven
months.
It's
a
boy.
Try
to
get
him
to
drink
one
of
these.
Dad?

You
want
some
water?
-
You
are
in
for
a
surprise.
Having
a
kid
changes
everything.
There's
the
diapers
and
the
burping
-
Did
you
do
any
of
that?
But
I
hear
it's
terrible.
Then
you
spend
years
trying
...fill
its
head
with
nonsense,
-
You
think
I'm
up
for
it?
Drink
half
the
can.
Everyone
wins.
People
needn't
worry
so
much.
This
is
not
how
I
go.
-
Really?
-
The
old
lady
by
the
swamp?
No,
she
was
old
and
probably
senile.
I
saw
my
death
in
that
eye,
So
how
does
it
happen?
Surprise
ending.
Your
mother
thought
Look
at
us.
We're
talking
fine.
We're
storytellers,
both
of
us.
I
speak
mine
out,
Dad...
I
hope
to
talk
about
some
things
You
mean
while
I'm
here.
I
just
want
to
know
Events.
Stories.
You.
Your
mother
hasn't
been
-
lf
you
wanted
to,
you
could
fix
it.
-
You
know
where
the
chemicals
are?
I
was
never
much
for
being
And
this
here,
being
stuck
in
bed...
Dying
is
the
worst
thing
-
I
thought
you
said
you
weren't
dying.
The
last
part
is
much
more
unusual.
Trust
me
on
that.
Dr.
Bennett
said
I
have
Oh,
that's
nothing.
Once,
-
Did
you
have
the
chickenpox?
Truth
is,
no
one
quite
knew
Most
times
a
person
...while
I
found
myself
in
a
hurry.
My
muscles
and
my
bones
couldn't
So
I
spent
the
better
part
...with
the
encyclopedia
being
I
had
made
it
all
the
way
to
the
G's...
...hoping
to
find
an
answer
...when
I
uncovered
an
article
"Kept
in
a
small
bowl,
With
more
space...
...the
fish
will
grow
double,
triple,
It
occurred
to
me
then
that
perhaps
...was
that
I
was
intended
After
all,
a
giant
man
can't
have
As
soon
as
my
bones
had
settled
...I
set
upon
my
plan
to
make
Tigers,
go!
Edward
Bloom!
Doggy!
My
doggy!
I
was
the
biggest
thing
Until
one
day,
a
stranger
arrived.
Calm
down.
Calm
down,
everybody.
-
Mr.
Mayor,
he
ate
an
entire
corn
field.
If
you
ain't
gonna
stop
him,
mayor,
I
won't
have
mob
violence
Now,
has
someone
tried
-
You
can't
reason
with
him.
I'll
do
it.
I'll
talk
to
him.
That
creature
could
crush
you
Oh,
trust
me,
he'll
have
to
try.
Hello?
My
name
is
Edward
Bloom,
Go
away!
Now,
I'm
not
going
anywhere
I
said,
go
away!
Armed
with
the
foreknowledge
...I
knew
the
giant
couldn't
kill
me.
All
the
same,
I
preferred
to
keep
Why
are
you
here?
So
you
can
eat
me.
The
town
decided
to
send
My
arms
are
a
little
stringy,
but
I
mean,
I'd
be
tempted
So
I
guess,
well...
If
you'd
just
get
it
over
with
quick,
Oh,
come
on!
I
can't
go
back!
If
I
go
back,
I'd
rather
be
dinner
than
a
coward.
Here.
You
can
start
with
my
hand.
I
don't
want
to
eat
you.
I
just
get
so
hungry.
Did
you
ever
think
that
...but
maybe
this
town
I've
heard
in
real
cities
...you
can't
even
see
-
Really?
And
all-you-can-eat
buffets.
-
Now,
you
can
eat
a
lot,
can't
you?
So
why
are
you
wasting
your
time
You're
a
big
man.
You're
just
trying
to
get
me
-
What's
your
name,
giant?
Well,
mine's
Edward.
Well,
I
do
want
you
to
leave,
Karl.
I
mean,
you
think
this
town
Well,
it's
too
small
for
a
man
So,
what
do
you
say?
Join
me?
Okay.
Okay.
Now,
first,
we
gotta
Edward
Bloom,
first
son
of
Ashton...
...it's
with
a
heavy
heart
But
take
with
you
...and
know
that
any
time
...all
our
doors
are
open
to
you.
That
afternoon
as
I
left
Ashton,
Find
yourself
a
nice
girl,
now!
Watch
your
pride,
Edward
Bloom!
But
there
was
one
person
whose
She
said
that
the
biggest
fish
...gets
that
way
-
What'd
she
say?

There
were
two
roads
out
of
Ashton:
A
new
one
which
was
paved
People
didn't
use
...and
it
had
developed
a
reputation
Well,
since
I
had
no
intention
...this
seemed
as
good
a
time
as
any
-
You
know
anyone
who's
taken
it?
He
was
going
to
Paris,
France.
I
guess
he
liked
it.
I'll
tell
you
what.
I'll
cut
through
here,
You're
just
trying
to
run
away,
Here.
Just
to
be
sure,
you
can
take
my
pack.
Why,
you
son
of
a...
Now,
there
comes
a
point
...will
swallow
his
pride
and
admit
The
truth
is,
And
what
I
recall
of
...the
more
difficult
something
is,
Friend!
Welcome
to
you!
-
What's
your
name?
-
"Bloom"
like
a
flower?
Oh,
here!
Here
you
are,
right
here.
We
weren't
expecting
you
yet.
-
You
were
expecting
me?
-
You
must've
taken
a
shortcut.
Life
will
do
that
to
you.
-
But
it's
longer.
And
you're
here
now,
What
is
this
place?
The
town
of
Spectre.
Now,
it
says
here
Last
person
we
had
from
Ashton
The
poet?
He's
still
here.
Let
me
buy
you
a
drink.
Hell,
I'll
have
him
tell
you!
I
have
to
meet
somebody,
Now,
son,
I
already
told
you.
Now,
tell
me
if
that
isn't
It
truly
is.
Well,
everything
tastes
better
here.
Never
gets
too
hot,
At
night,
the
wind
goes
through
...there
was
a
whole
symphony
Hey!
Jenny!
Come
back
here!
Jenny!
Hey,
I
need
those.
-
There
is
no
softer
ground
than
town.
He's
our
poet
laureate.
Come
on.
I
agreed
to
spend
the
afternoon,
...the
mystery
of
how
a
place
could
I've
been
working
on
this
poem
Really?
There's
a
lot
of
expectation.
May
I?
It's
only
three
lines
long.
This
is
why
you
should
never
show
I
got
him!
There's
leeches
in
there.
-
Did
you
see
that
woman?
-
Well,
she
was...
Yes,
she
was.
It's
not
a
woman.
It's
a
fish.
Fish
looks
different
My
daddy
said
it
looked
like
the
...back
from
the
dead.
Oh,
darn.
-
How
old
are
you?
I'm
8.
That
means
when
I'm
18,
-
And
when
I'm
28,
you'll
only
be
38.
And
when
I'm
38,
you'll
be
48.
Sure
is
a
lot
now,
though,
huh?
Hey,
Edward!


Roses
are
red
I
love
Spectre...
Excuse
me.
Jenny
thinks
you're
quite
a
catch.
What?
I
said,
you're
quite
a
catch.
I
have
to
leave.
Tonight.
Why?
This
town
is
more
than
any
man
And
if
I
were
to
end
up
here,
But
the
truth
is,
I'm
just
not
ready
But
no
one's
ever
left.
How
are
you
gonna
make
it
Well,
I
suspect
it
will
hurt.
A
lot.
Now,
I'm
sorry,
but...
-
You
won't
find
a
better
place.
Promise
me
you'll
come
back.
I
promise.
Someday.
That
night,
The
first
was
that
a
dangerous
path
The
second
was
that
I
was
These
woods
would
become
As
difficult
as
it
was
to
reach
Spectre,
After
all,
no
man
can
avoid
And
then
I
realized
This
isn't
how
I
die.
Friend.
-
What
happened
to
your
shoes?
I
don't
know
if
you
saw
it,
...in
the
most
recent
Newsweek.
Really?
That's
just
wonderful.
I
spent
a
week
in
Morocco
Oh.
We'll
have
to
pick
up
a
copy.
I
don't
know
if
you're
aware
of
this,
...but
African
parrots,
in
their
native
Really?
You're
lucky
to
get
four
words
But
if
you
were
to
walk
...you'd
hear
them
speaking
Those
parrots
talk
about
everything.
Everything
but
religion.
Why
not
religion,
Dad?
It's
rude
to
talk
about
religion.
You
Josephine
actually
went
Oh,
so
you
know.
Hello.
Hi.
How
are
you
feeling?
Oh,
I
was
dreaming.
What
were
you
dreaming
about?
Oh,
I
don't
usually
remember...
...unless
they're
especially
portentous.
It
means
when
you
dream
about
Like
one
night,
I
had
a
dream...
...where
this
crow
came
and
said:
"Your
aunt
is
gonna
die."
I
was
so
scared,
...but
they
said
it
was
just
a
dream
But
the
next
morning,
That's
terrible.
Terrible
for
her,
but
think
about
me,
Wasn't
three
weeks
later
when
the
...and
said,
"Your
daddy's
gonna
die."
I
didn't
know
what
to
do.
I
finally
told
my
father,
but
he
said:
"Oh,
not
to
worry."
The
next
morning,
he
wasn't
himself.
Kept
looking
around,
waiting
for
Because
the
crow
didn't
say
how
it
"Your
daddy's
gonna
die."
Well,
he
left
home
early
When
he
finally
came
back,
...like
he
was
waiting
He
said
to
my
mother:
"I've
just
had
the
worst
day
of
my
life."
"You
think
you've
had
a
bad
day?"
"This
morning,
the
milkman
Because,
see,
my
mother
-
Can
I
take
your
picture?
Just
look
up
the
word
"handsome"
Please?
All
right.
I
have
photos
of
the
wedding
There
is
a
great
one
I
want
to
see
pictures
of
your
wedding.
That's
because
we
didn't
have
Your
mother-in-law
was
-
She
was
engaged
to
somebody
else.
Will
never
told
you?
Probably
just
as
well.
He
would
have
told
it
wrong,
anyway.
All
the
facts,
none
of
the
flavor.
Oh.
So
this
is
a
tall
tale.
Well,
it's
not
a
short
one.

I'd
just
left
Spectre
and
was
I'd
just
left
Spectre
and
was
I'd
just
left
Spectre
and
was
Not
knowing
what
...I
explored
every
opportunity
Coco!
Coco!
There
they
are.
Ladies
and
gentlemen!
You
may
think
You
may
think
you've
seen
the
bizarre.
But
I've
traveled
...and
let
me
tell
you,
When
I
met
this
man...
...he
was
picking
oranges
in
Florida.
His
fellow
workers
called
him
Because
when
you
worked
...he
blocked
out
the
daylight!
Not
to
alarm
you,
ma'am,
...he
could
crush
your
head
...like
a
tiny
walnut.
No.
No,
ladies
and
gentlemen...
...he
will
not
hurt
her...
...because
he
is
our
own
gentle
giant.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
...thank
y'all
for
coming.
Drive
home
safely,
everyone.
It
was
on
that
night
And
I
met
mine,
almost.
They
say
when
you
meet
And
that's
true.
What
they
don't
tell
you
...it
moves
extra
fast
to
catch
up.
What's
your
name?
-
It's
Karl.
Tell
me,
Karl,
have
you
ever
heard
-
No.
-
Nope.
Here
you
go.
Here
you
are.
Mr.
Soggybottom,
...so
he
can
use
your
back
Okay.
Thank
you.
Yeah.
Hey,
kid.
-
Your
friend
just
made
himself
a
star.
-
My
attorney,
Mr.
Soggybottom.
Pleased
to
meet
you.
What's
the
matter?
I
haven't
...since
the
elephant
sat
"Depressed"?
See?
The
big
guy
likes
it.
I
just
saw
the
woman
I'm
gonna
marry.
I
know
it.
But
I
lost
her.
Oh,
tough
break.
Well,
most
men
have
to
get
married
I'm
gonna
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
Damn,
kid.
Let
me
guess.
Real
pretty?
Reddish-blondish
hair?
Blue
dress?
Yeah!
I
know
her
uncle.
Friends
of
the
family.
Who
is
she?
Where
does
she
live?
Forget
it.
Don't
waste
your
time.
-
What?
You
don't
even
know
me.
You
were
hot
shit
back
in
Hickville,
but
You
don't
have
a
plan
or
a
job.
Nothing
except
the
clothes
Well,
I
have
a
whole
backpack
Oh,
someone
stole
my
backpack.
You
were
a
big
fish
in
a
small
pond,
...and
you're
drowning.
-
You'll
be
happy
there.
I'll
find
that
girl,
marry
her,
I
don't
have
a
job,
but
I
would
And
I
may
not
have
much...
...but
I
have
more
determination
I'm
sorry,
kid.
I
don't
do
charity.
Wait.
Look,
I'll
work
...and
you
won't
have
to
pay
me.
You
just
have
to
tell
me
who
she
is.
Every
month
you
work
for
me...
...l'll
tell
you
one
thing
about
her.
Let's
get
started.
From
that
moment
on,
I
did
everything
I'd
go
three
days
And
four
days
without
sleeping.
What
kept
me
going
was
...who
would
be
my
wife.
Stick
together,
that's
the
way
-
The
way
it
was,
and
the
way
it
will
be.
It's
been
a
month
today.
This
girl,
the
love
of
your
life...
...her
favorite
flowers
are
daffodils.
-
So
get
that
stuff...
Daffodils.
Daffodils.
True
to
his
word...
...every
month
Amos
would
tell
me
...about
the
woman
of
my
dreams.
Enjoy
yourselves,
enjoy
yourselves.
She's
going
to
college.
College.
She's
going
to
college.
She
likes
music.
Music.
She
likes
music.
Over
the
months,
I
learned
a
lot
Over
the
months,
I
learned
a
lot
...but
not
her
name,
That
time
had
come.
Mr.
Calloway?
It's
Edward
Bloom.
Mr.
Calloway?
No.
Wait!
That
night,
I
discovered
that
most
...are
simply
lonely
and
lacking
Didn't
kill
anything,
did
I?
A
few
rabbits.
But
I
think
one
of
them
That
would
explain
the
indigestion.
Thank
you.
I
was
wrong
about
you,
kid.
You
may
not
have
much,
You
could
get
any
girl.
There's
only
one
I
want.
Her
name...
...is
Sandra
Templeton.
She
goes
to
Auburn.
Semester's
almost
over,
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
-
Good
luck,
kid!
-
Bye,
now.
After
saying
my
goodbyes,
...to
get
to
Auburn
that
afternoon.
You
don't
know
me,
...and
I
love
you.
I've
spent
the
last
three
years
I've
been
shot,
stabbed,
and
trampled
But
it's
all
been
worth
it
...and
to
finally
get
to
talk
to
you.
Because
I'm
destined
to
marry
you.
I
knew
it
when
I
saw
you
at
the
circus,
-
I'm
sorry.
I'm
the
luckiest
person
No,
I'm
sorry
I'm
engaged
But
you're
wrong.
I
do
know
you.
At
least
by
reputation.
Edward
Bloom
from
Ashton.
See,
I'm
actually
engaged
He
was
a
few
years
older
than
you.
