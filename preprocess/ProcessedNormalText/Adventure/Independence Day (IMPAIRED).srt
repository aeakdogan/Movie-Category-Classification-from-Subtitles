We're

here's
our

Let's
see
it.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
We
have
to
keep
it
If
we'll
all
Open
the
door.
Yes,
sir.
My
God.
Why
the
hell
wasn't
Two
words,
plausible
I
don't
understand.
Where
does
all
this
How
do
you
get
funding
You
don't
actually
think
they
spend
$20,000
$30,000
on
a
toilet
seat,
Mr.
President,
He's
been
heading
up
on
this
project
How
do
you
do.
Mr.
President.
Wow.
This--
As
you
can
imagine,
they
don't
let
us
I
can
understand
that.
Well,
I
guess
the
big
tamale,
huh?
Follow
me.
[Assistant
She's
a
beaut,
Dr.
Okun:
As
you
can
see
we've
been
trying
since
the
late
1960s.
Don't
tell
me
you've
had
this
and
you
don't
know
Oh,
hell,
no.
No,
no.
We
know
tons
about
them.
But
the
neatest
stuff--
has
only
happened
See,
we
can't
duplicate
so
we've
never
been
able
But
since
these
guys
all
the
little
gizmos
The
last
2
4
hours
have
Exciting?
I
don't
think
"
exciting"
is
the
word
I'd
choose
You
guys
are
hoping
You
said
you
can
repair
Can
you
tell
us
anything
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
I
mean,
they're
not
all
that

Probably
why
in
our

Hey.
Hey.

Hmm?
This
is--

some
of
us
have

"
The--"
When
we
found
them,
they
were
wearing
some
sort
but
once
we
got
them
off,
we
learned
a
great
deal
Eyes,

We're
assuming
they

some
other

It's

So...
It's
an

You
just--
You
have
to
get

more
advanced.
David,
you
unlocked
You
cracked
the
code.
Oh,
no,
no.
All
I
did
was
stumble
I
don't
know
Why
don't
you
show
them
figure
out
what
they
haven't
and
we'll
see
if
you're
as
smart
What
code?
Captain

I'm
sorry,
Captain.
I
can't
let
you
pass
OK.
Come
here.
You
want
to

Maybe
I'll
just
leave
Let
them
pass.
Let
them
pass.

Did
you
see
that?
Come
on
down.
Come
on
down.
Watch
your

though
how
they
sat
on
that,

Uh,
you
see
Yeah.
We've
been
working
trying
to
get
a
fix
Some
stuff
we
Uh,
this,
is
the

And,
uh,
this
doohickey
Oh...Well,
it
was
connected
Here.
Uh,
these
configurations,
Well,
to
be
honest,
we--we--we
don't
know
But
this
is
to
guide
and
navigate
Ha
ha.
Neat,
huh?
That's
very
good.
Dr.
Isaacs,
can
I
just
have
See
these

here?
just
like
They're
using

That's
how
they're
Huh.

Come
on.
Get
off

Look
at

Wow!
Does
that

does.

I
have
no

you

Go
ahead.


Steven:
What
the

My
fault.
That
Coke

was
protected

is,

we
gotta

How
did
you
I
gave
it
a
cold.
I
gave
it
a

A
computer
virus.
Are
you
telling
us
you
can
send
out
that
will
disable
That's
right.
Just
like
they
used
we
can
use
their
own

we
plant
a
virus
it's
gonna
then

down
into
all
the

I--I'm
sorry.
Just
how,
exactly,
do
we
infect
with
this
virus?
Well...
we're
going
to,
uh...
have
to,
um,
ahem,
fly
their
alien
craft
and
dock
with
it.
We
can
enter
here,
as
shown
in
these
We
then
upload
the
virus.
We
then
set
off

will
disable
it,
and
that'll
disorient

to,
uh...
to

take
'em
out.
Take
'em
down.

your...
do
your

to
mention
that

wouldn't
