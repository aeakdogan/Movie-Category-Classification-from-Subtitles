MAN:
Better
hurry.
MAN:
Here
you
go,
my
friend.
Make
sure
you
get
us
as
close
as
you
can!
I'll
give
you
something
extra
I'm
going
to
get
you
close,
You
don't
want
to
be
eaten.
-Ready,
amigo?
One,
two,
three!

Eric,
heave!

Scared?
This
is
great.
ERIC:
See
anything
yet?
No,
not
yet.


-What
was
that?

BEN:
Hold
on!
ERIC:
What's
happening?
Make
it
stop!
What
happened
to
them?
BEN:
I
don't
know.
Oh,
my
God.
ERIC:
We're
going
to
crash!
I'm
going
to
take
this
loose!
-Let
go
of
the
rope!
BEN:
Move
your
hands!
Come
onl
Here
we
go!
It's
going
be
okay,
bud.
Charlie,
those
are
herbivores.
But
these
are
carnivores,
They
use
their
teeth
and
their
claws
Alan,
he's
three.
Let's
wait
till
he's
five.
Right.
Sorry,
Charlie.
WOMAN:
Ellie?
It's
Tom.
He
says
he
has
to
talk
to
you
Tell
him
I
won't
lose
the
Horner
quote.
ELLIE:
Hey,
Mark!
Hey,
babe,
look
who's
here.
This
is
Alan.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Alan.
Daddy,
this
is
a
herbivore
Dinosaur
man?
Jack,
say
my
name.
Is
my
name
Alan?
Is
my
name
Alan?

ALAN:
He
used
to
know
me.
ELLIE:
It's
sad,
huh?
Thanks.
Mark's
been
working
What
do
they
do,
Mark?
International
relations,

ELLIE:
Call
of
the
wild
one.
You
guys
catch
up.
Thanks,
babe.
He's
a
great
guy.
-So,
what
are
you
working
on
now?
My
favourite.
Do
you
remember
the
sounds
they
made?
I
try
not
to.
All
our
theories
about
Raptor
intelligence...
...what
they
were
capable
of,
-Tell
me.
...and
found
what
looks
to
be
Wait
a
second.
So
we
were
right.
-They'd
the
ability
to
vocalise.
Which
explains
They'd
coordinate
attacks
so
their
prey
-They
could
talk
to
each
other.

Ellie,
they
were
smart.
They
were
smarter
They
were
smarter
than
primates.
I
just
wanted
to
say,
if
you
ever
need
help,
So
you
can
call
me.
Anything,
anytime.
Sure.

You're
still
the
best.
I
mean
that.
The
last
of
my
breed.
ALAN:
ltis
through
the
study
of

we
can
determine

This
lets
us
theorise,
theorise,
mind
you...
...that
the
Raptor
was
capable
...which
would
have
been
Raptors
were
fierce,
intelligent...
...and
socially
sophisticated.
They
were
able
to
huntin
numbers
Were
it
not
for
the
cataclysmic
events
...it's
entirely
possible
...would
have
become
I
hope
this
has
been
ofinterest.
It
certainly
excites
us
as
paleontologists.
There
is
much
more
to
discover.
Thatis
why
we
continue
to
need,
Thank
you.

Thank
you
very
much,
Dr.
Grant.
Now,
does
anyone
have
a
question?
Fine.
Does
anyone
have
a
question
Or
the
incidentin
San
Diego...
...which
I
did
not
witness?
Yes,
sir?
STUDENT:
Your
theory
on
Raptors
is
good,
Once

And
itis
in

...that

Nothing
more
and
nothing

Are
you
saying
...and
study
them
if
you
had
the
chance?
No

Earth
or

What
we
got
here,
Nashy?
Einhorn

Udesky.
-It's
Paul
Kirby.
Just
checking--
We're
good
to
go
here.
Matter
of
fact,
I
can
lock
things
down
Well,
that's
right...
...two
of
the
very
best
men
No,
I
haven't
worked
...but
believe
me,
sir,
both
of
these
men
PAUL:
Are
you
all
right?
It's
gonna
be
a
walk
in
the
park.
GIRL:
Billy,
I
don't
think
Let's
try
the
toothbrush.
You've
got
to
go
slowly.
Just
take
a
little
bit
at
a
time.
I
can
never
tell
what's
rock
Technically,
it's
all
rock.
The
calcium
in
the
bones
But
you
can
feel
the
difference.
See?
Rough...
...smooth.
Rough,
smooth.
Dr.
Grant.
Mr.
Brennan.
So,
how
did
it
go?
Well,
it's
not
too
late
BILLY:
That
good,
huh?
We'll
to
have
to
pack
up
in
four
weeks.
BILLY:
Three.
I
had
to
rent
some
equipment.
Come
here.
I
got
to
show
you
something.
BILLY:
You
like
computers,
right?
BILLY:
Meet
the
future
of
paleontology.
It's
a
rapid
prototyper.
I
enter
the
scanned
data
The
computer
breaks
it
down
And
this
thing
sculpts
it,
It's
done.
I
give
you
the
resonating
chamber
Listen
to
this.

Wow.
This
is
brilliant,
Billy.
Really,
it
is.
Sad
to
say,
it's
just
a
little
bit
late.
Dr.
Grant?
Paul
Kirby,
Kirby
Enterprises.
My
card.
How
you
doing,
Billy?
ALAN:
What
can
I
do
for
you,
Mr.
Kirby?
First
thing,
I'm
a
great
admirer
of
yours.
And
I
have
a
proposition
Would
you
have
dinner
-It'll
be
our
treat.
...l'm
tired,
I've
been
travelling.
Believe
me,
this
will
be
worth
your
while.
-We'd
love
to.
PAUL:
This
evening
then.

PAUL:
Billy,
thank
you
for
coming.
Amanda,
this
is
Billy
and
Dr.
Grant.
BILLY:
Mrs.
Kirby,
how
are
you?
What
are
you
boys
drinking?
-Ice
Pick,
Catfish.
-We've
admired
your
work
for
years.
Amanda
and
I
just
love
the
outdoors.
We've
been
on
nearly
every
adventure
tour
The
Nile,
Galapagos,
K2.
We
even
have
two
seats
reserved
For
our
wedding
anniversary
this
year,
-Something--
I've
chartered
an
airplane
PAUL:
And
we'd
like
you
to
be
our
guide.
CAT:
There
you
go,
guys.
That's
a
very
kind
offer,
Mr.
Kirby,
I
can
recommend
a
couple
of
guys
No,
no.
You're
the
best.
You've
seen
these
animals
in
the
flesh.
You
wouldn't
be
able
to
fly
low
enough
That's
the
interesting
part,
BILLY:
How
low?
I'm
no
aviation
expert,
but
a
heck
From
what
I
understand,
That's
hard
to
believe.
Through
my
business
dealings,
...l've
made
a
lot
of
friends
in
high
places.
In
this
case,
the
Costa
Rican
government.
AMANDA:
Dr.
Grant,
you
have
no
idea...
...how
important
it
is
that
you
come
along.
Mrs.
Kirby,
l--
And,
of
course,
we'd
love
to
make
So...
...l
could
write
all
kinds
of
numbers
Tell
me...
...what's
it
gonna
take?
Even
with
what
I
pay
you,
No
way.
This
one's
lucky.
Couple
of
years
ago,
...off
these
cliffs
in
New
Zealand.
And
this
big
updraft
came
and
swept
me
That
does
sound
lucky.
It
was
this
strap
alone
that
saved
my
life.
Got
hooked
on
a
rock
as
I
was
falling.
Reverse
Darwinism.
Alan,
I
want
to
thank
you
The
bones
will
still
be
there
That's
the
great
thing
about
bones.
And
truth
is,
you
got
me
into
this.
And
I
have
no
intention
ALAN:
Don't
get
too
excited.
Chances
are,
we
won't
see
a
thing.
Your
turn
to
be
nice.
Wake
me
when
we
get
there.
So
how
do
you
know
the
Kirbys?
Through
our
church.

BILLY:
Alan.
Alanl
Wake
up.
We're
almost
there.
MAN
ON
RADIO:
Unidentified

...this
is
San
Juan

Immediately
turn
to
coordinates
two--


My
God,
I
had
forgotten.
We
did
it,
honey.
We're
here.
UDESKY:
No,
I
thought
I'd
keep
it
to
myself.
Everyone,
if
you
look
out
the
left
...you
can
see
In
fact,
you
can
see
at
the
front
Udesky?
Nash?
How
about
up
front?
UDESKY:
Nothing
yet,
Mr.
Kirby.
Mrs.
Kirby,
look!
Out
here,
you'll
see
a
group
of....
Mr.
Kirby,
we
have
a
landing
strip.
No!
I
told
you,
What
do
you
mean?
You
can't
land!
Hold
on.
I
can
explain--
You
cannot
land
on
this
island!
AMANDA:
It
will
be
fine.
ALAN:
Are
you
crazy?
Will
you
please
sit
down?
Billy...
...tell
me
we
didn't
land.
AMANDA:

Ericl
Benl
I
think
they're
looking
for
someone.
AMANDA:
Benl
PAUL:
Dr.
Grant,
are
you
all
right?
PAUL:
I'm
sorry
we
had
to
be
so
rough.
That
would
be
Cooper.
What
are
they
doing?
PAUL:
Setting
up
a
perimeter
Trust
me,
on
this
island,
We
have
to
get
back
on
that
plane!
Tell
your
wife
to
stop
making
that
noise!
-Amanda!
PAUL:
Honey,
Dr.
Grant
said
AMANDA:
What?
He
says
it's
a
bad
idea!
What's
a
bad
idea?

What
was
that?
That's
a
Tyrannosaurus.

I
don't
think
so.
It
sounds
bigger.
We
have
to
leave!
We
have
to
leave
now!
NASH:
Get
on
the
plane!
Get
on
the
plane!
-What
about
the
other
guy?
He
can
handle
himself.


Get
on
the
plane!
PAUL:
It's
all
right.

-Paul,
we
can't--
We'll
circle
the
island.
Give
me
a
hand,
Udesky!
Stop!
What
are
you
doing?
That's
Cooper!
Stop.
Come
on,
get
out
of
the
way!
You
know
I
can't
stop
this
plane.
Oh,
my
God!
UDESKY:
Fuel
cut-off!

You
okay?
UDESKY:
We're
okay
up
here.
Everyone,

San

Mayday,

Who
has
the

PAUL:
I
do.
I
got
it
right
here.
UDESKY:
We're
not
getting
anything.
We
haven't
landed
yet.
WOMAN:
All
circuits
are
busy.

What
was
that?

ALAN:
Keep
still!
Keep
still!
PAUL:
Relax.
What
is
it?
What?
UDESKY:
What
is
it?
Hang
on,
everyonel




NASH:
Help
me!



ALAN:
Mrs.
Kirby,
come
back!
Amanda!

ALAN:
Follow
me!
This
way!
In
here!


I
think
we
lost
him.

It's
okay,
it's
dead.

Nobody
move
a
muscle.



No,
no!
Please,
don't!
Stop,
please.
It's
time
you
did
some
explaining,
PAUL:
We
called
everyone.
No
one
would
help
us.
The
Costa
Rican
The
U.S.
Embassy,
...told
us
we
should
accept
the
inevitable.
BILLY:
You
let
a
12-year-old
PAUL:
No!
PAUL:
Ben
Hildebrand.
Paul
and
I
divorced
over
a
year
ago.
All
right,
why
me?
He
said
we
needed
someone
Yes,
but
I
did
not
tell
you
I
have
never
been
on
this
island.
Sure
you
have.
You
wrote
that
book.
That
was
lsla
Nublar.
You
mean
there
are
two
islands
PAUL:
Stay
out
of
this.
-Eight
weeks.
Billy.
We'll
go
back
to
the
plane,
Then
we
make
for
the
coast.
Dr.
Grant,
we're
not
leaving
this
island
Then
you
can
go
and
look
for
him.
Oryou
can
stick
with
us,
Either
way...
...you
probably
won't
get
off
So?
What
do
we
do?
We
search
for
your
son...
...in
the
direction
that
they're
going.
PAUL:
Excellent.
PAUL:
Sorry.
It's
nothing
you
haven't
seen
before,
Paul.
AMANDA:
How
much
weight
About
25
pounds.
I've
been
swimming.
Swimming?
You
hate
to
swim.
I
know.
I
learned.
-You
look
good.

ALAN:
How
would
you
classify
it,
Billy?
...it's
a
super-predator.
A
Suchomimus.
-That
snout.
-Baryonyx?
Spinosaurus
aegypticus.
-I
don't
remember
that
on
lngen's
list.
And
it
makes
you
wonder
So,
Mr.
Kirby,
tell
me.
...did
you
base
camp
30,000
feet.
You
were
about
1,000
feet
above
it,
No,
that's
a
common
mistake.
There's
no
such
thing
It's
Kirby
Paint
and
Tile
Plus.
We're
in
the
Westgate
Shopping
Centre,
BILLY:
I
don't
suppose
that
cheque
PAUL:
I
will
pay
you
the
money
I
owe
you.
Here
we
are,
in
the
worst
place
PAUL:
Wait,
fellas.
Hold
on!
I'll
make
this
up
to
you.
If
you
ever
do
a
bathroom
or
a
kitchen....
PAUL:
You're
not
a
mercenary,
are
you?
That's
true.
What
are
you?
I'm
like
a
booking
agent.
One
of
the
guys
UDESKY:
Excuse
me.
Here.
-So
you
run
a
hardware
store?
-You
never
can
tell
about
people,
can
you?
AMANDA:
Eric!
PAUL:
Would
you
stop
that?
Dr.
Grant
says
Maybe
we
should
split
up.
-We
could
cover
twice
as
much.
Dr.
Grant
says
this--
Why
hire
an
expert
Except
Dr.
Grant
isn't
looking
for
Eric.
-He's
looking
for
the
coast.
When
that
"Tricycloplots"
attacks
you,
-Don't
worry
about
that.
PAUL:
What
did
you
say?
If
we
split
up,
I'm
going
with
you
guys.
-Eric!
ALAN:
Mrs.
Kirby!
Mrs.
Kirby!
Mrs.
Kirby,
the
chances
are
remote
Young
adult.
UDESKY:
Hey,
guys!
That's
my
camera.
The
battery's
dead.
I've
got
an
idea.
Let
me
have
the
camera.
ERIC:
Where
were
you
on
that
one,
Ma?
BEN:
Okay,
dive.
Dive.
Come
on,
Ma.
AMANDA:
Eric.
I
shot
this
the
morning
they
disappeared.
PAUL:
I
want
that.
Let
me
take
that.
Come
on,
give
me
that.
Come
on,
baby.
ERIC:
See
anything
yet?
BEN:
No,
notyetl
ERIC:
What
was
that?
BEN:
Unclip
us.
BEN:
There's
a
big
clipl
BEN:
I'm
going
to
unhook
you,
all
right?
One,
two,
threel
Are
you
okay,
buddy?
The
camera's
still
on.
He's
alive.
I
know
he's
alive.
We're
gonna
find
him.
Can
you
fly
one
of
those?
Maybe.
As
long
as
the
sail
is
not
torn.
Well,
let's
take
it.
If
we
spot
a
plane,
Pull
it
over
this
way.


PAUL:
I
got
it,
hold
on!
Okay.
Okay.
My
God!
Okay,
you're
free.
Get
her
back,
Mr.
Kirby!
PAUL:
Amanda!
Waitl

Amanda!
Amanda,
stop.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry
about
Ben.
It's
not
Ben,
Paul.
It's
Eric.
He's
out
there
all
by
himself.
PAUL:
I
know,
I
know.
Our
baby
is
out
here
all
by
himself.
PAUL:
Listen
to
me.
We'll
find
him.
I
promise.
Paul.
PAUL:
Dr.
Grant!
You
should
come
look
at
thisl


Raptor.
PAUL:
We're
going
to
find
him.
Are
you
listening
to
me?
Kid's
got
resources.
Remember
what
it
was
like
Where's
Billy?
ALAN:
What
are
you
doing?
I
was
photographing
the
nest.
Don't
do
that
again.
I'm
sorry.
If
I
lose
you,
PAUL:
I
bet
you
Eric
is
in
there.
Don't
you
think?
I'd
bet
my
bottom
dollar!
BILLY:
What
do
you
think
it
is?
UDESKY:
As
far
as
I'm
concerned,
-Eric!
What
the
hell.

Who's
got
some
change?
I've
got
$1.10.


This
is
how
you
make
dinosaurs?
No.
This
is
how
you
play
God.


PAUL:
This
way!
It's
locked!
PAUL:
This
way,
this
way!

UDESKY:
Hey,
over
here!

Push,
push!

My
God.
He's
calling
for
help.
Come
on!



Into
the
herd!


Head
for
the
trees!


Udesky.


BILLY:
Mr.
Kirby!
-Billy?
PAUL:
Oh,
my
God.
AMANDA:
Mr.
Udesky!
He's
dead.
Oh,
my
God.
No,
he's
not.
BILLY:
No,
wait.
Something's
not
right.
PAUL:
We've
got
to
help
him.
Amandal

Hold
on!

BILLY:
They
set
a
trap.
They
actually
set
a
trap.

What
are
you
saying?
What
are
you
looking
for?



ALAN:
Wait!

Thanks.
Thanks
a
lot,
Eric.
You
know
who
I
am?
ALAN:
Yeah.
Your
parents
are
here.
Together?
Together.
That's
not
good.
They
don't
do
so
well
together.
You'd
be
surprised
what
people
can
do...
...when
they
have
to.
You're
Alan
Grant.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Your
parents...
...invited
me
along.
I
read
both
of
your
books.
I
liked
the
first
one
more.
Before
you
were
on
the
island.
You
liked
dinosaurs
back
then.
Back
then,
they
hadn't
tried
to
eat
me
yet.
ERIC:
When
lngen
cleared
out,
Any
weapons?
No,
and
I
just
used
the
last
And
I
appreciate
that.

ERIC:
Be
careful
with
that.
T-Rex.
It
scares
the
smaller
ones
away...
...but
it
attracts
one
really
big
one
This
is
T-Rex
pee?
How
did
you
get
it?
You
don't
want
to
know.
ERIC:
Dessert?
I
have
to
tell
you,
I'm
astonished
Is
that
all
it's
been?
You're
alive
and
that's
the
important
thing.
ALAN:
Thanks
to
you,
Did
you
read
Malcolm's
book?
Yeah.
So?
I
don't
know.
I
mean....
It
was
kind
of
preachy.
And
too
much
chaos.
Everything
is
chaos.
Seemed
like
he
was
high
on
himself.
That's
two
things
that
we
have
in
common.

Listen.
ERIC:
Compys!
BILLY:
Alan!
Alanl
Alan!
PAUL:
No
matter
how
this
turns
out...
...it
wasn't
your
fault.
Eric's
always
been
a
strong-willed
kid.
Always.
Then
you
throw
someone
...and...
...well.
Well,
what?
All
I'm
saying
is,
it's
not
your
fault.
No.
If
he'd
been
with
you,
You
drive
five
miles
under
the
speed
limit.
And
I've
totalled
three
cars
in
three
years.
Well,
not
three.
The
Buick
wasn't
really
totalled.
I
just
said
it
was,
I
am
so
sorry
that
you
have
to
be
here.
I'm
not.
ALAN:
-Looks
in
good
shape.
No,
no.
Just
something
left
behind.
But
it
floats.
BILLY:
We
stick
to
the
plan.
Head
for
the
coast.
You're
not
gonna
look
for
Dr.
Grant?
The
coast
was
Alan's
idea.
PAUL:
I
agree.
What
about
Eric?
Eric's
a
smart
kid.
He
probably
knows
He
figures
the
big
dinosaurs
Right?
Sure.
ERIC:
You
know
what
this
is?
ALAN:
It's
a
Raptor
claw.
A
fossil.
Mine
is
new.
How
much
of
the
island
did
you
explore?
I
stayed
pretty
close
to
the
compound.
I
figured
if
anyone
came
looking
for
me,
ALAN:
We
need
to
get
to
the
coast.
ERIC:
Are
you
sure?
The
closeryou
get
to
water,
ALAN:
lf
we
can
find
our
way
...we
can
follow
that
river
out
to
the
coast.
After
we
find
your
parents.
ERIC:
Then
what?
-One
step
at
a
time.
What?

That's
my
dad's
satellite
phone!
Wait
a
minute.
How
do
you
know?

Dad!
Muml
Muml
Dadl

-Eric!
PAUL:
Eric!
This
way!
Mum!
Dad!
Eric!

Mum,
Dad!
Mum,
Dad!
I
knew
it.
My
God.
PAUL:
I
knew
it.
Oh,
God.
BILLY:
Boy,
am
I
glad
to
see
you.
Hey,
you
got
my
bag.
Yeah.
Lucky
strap.
Want
me
to
carry
it?
We
need
to
find
a
gap
here.
-How
did
you
know
we
were
here?
That
stupid
jingle
from
the
store.
PAUL:
My
phone?
-Where
is
it?
AMANDA:
When
did
you
use
it
last?
I
got
a
call
on
the
plane
and....
-What?
He
must
have
had
it
when
he--

Run.




Alan,
you
want
to
give
me
the
bag
back?
It's
okay,
I
got
it.
Please,
give
me
the
bag.
It's
not
safe.

ALAN:
Raptor
eggs.
Did
you
steal
Raptor
eggs?
Now
it
all
makes
sense.
BILLY:
I
swear,
if
I'd
known
It
was
an
impulse,
Enough
to
fund
the
dig
site
You
have
to
believe
me.
This
was
a
stupid
decision,
"With
the
best
intentions."
Some
of
the
worst
things
imaginable
You
know
what,
Billy?
As
far
as
I'm
concerned...
...you're
no
better
than
the
people
What
are
you
doing?
Those
things
know
we
have
the
eggs.
If
I
drop
them
in
the
river,
-What
if
they
catch
us
with
them?
ALAN:
There's
a
boat
at
the
bottom,
We
can
try
and
make
it
to
the
coast,




-You
okay?

Let's
do
this
one
at
a
time,
shall
we?


Okay,
come
on
over!
One
at
a
time!
All
right,
Eric.
I'm
going
to
leave
you
just
for
a
minute.
Mum!
I've
been
alone
in
a
water
truck
I
think
I
can
manage
Right,
we're
all
together
now.

Okay,
Eric.
PAUL:
Okay.
Over
you
go.

Mum?
Oh,
my
God.
AMANDA:
What
is
it?
For
what?


Dadl
AMANDA:
Eric!
PAUL:
Eric!
Ericl
I
can't
see
him!
Eric!

No!
This
way!
Billy?
Billy!
Billy,
stopl
Don't,
Billyl
Billyl
BILLY:
Eric,
hold
on!
Eric!
Jump!
Billy!



Let
go
now!


AMANDA:
Eric!
Eric!
There
he
is!
He's
across
the
river!
Get
him
out
of
here!
ERIC:
No!
ERIC:
What
about
Billy?
Hang
on,
Billy!
PAUL:
Wait.
Get
away!

There's
plenty
of
gasoline.
Now
we've
just
got
to
make
our
way
Work
out
some
sort
of
a
signal.
Build
a
fire
or
something.
ERIC:
Dr.
Grant?
Hey,
Eric,
how
are
you
doing?
I'm
sorry
about
Billy.
You
know
what
the
last
thing
I
said:
"You're
as
bad
as
the
people
Which
wasn't
true.
Billy
was
just
young.
That's
all.
I
have
a
theory
There
are
those
...and
those
who
want
to
be
astronauts.
The
astronomer,
or
the
paleontologist...
...gets
to
study
these
amazing
things
-But
then
you
never
get
to
go
into
space.
It's
the
difference
To
be
able
to
touch
them.
And
that's
all
Billy
wanted.
Dr.
Grant.
You
know
something,
Dr.
Grant?
Billy
was
right.

Listen.


ALAN:
Find
it
before
it
stops!
AMANDA:
Eric,
you
stay
on
that
boat.

PAUL:
It's
here.
It's
here.
God.

Remember
when
we

I
was
putting
the
boat
in
the
water
The
tow
truck
tried
to
pull
us
out
The

Kirby?
ERIC:
That
lady
you
called.
Who
is

How

you
know
that
she
can
help
us?
She's
the
one
person
-I
don't
think
I
ever
told
her
that.
You
hear
that?
The
ocean.
They
want
the
eggs.
Otherwise,
we'd
be
dead
already.
ALAN:
Everybody
get
down.
She
thinks
you
stole
the
eggs.
PAUL:
Get
behind
me.

Give
me
the
eggs.

Do
it,
Mum.

No.
Call

help.

Yeah.
