in
your
opinion,
do
these
They
hope
to
Freedom.
"They
hope
to
gain
their
freedom."
There's
one
born
every
minute.
I'm
going
to
give
it
to
them.
The
second
question?
What
is
it,
Major
Lawrence,
that
It's
clean.
Well,
now...
that's
a
very
illuminating
answer.
May
I...
take
one
farewell
picture?
I
gave
Math
Budad
One
clock
for
two
lamps.
ALI:
Fair?
I
robbed
him.
Trash.
I
must
find
Honourable?
Yes.
The
year
is
I
must
find
something
honourable.





Now
you
may
And
what
will
Now
I
go
home.
They
will
carry
my
Major
Lawrence
will
But
you
got
what
you
wanted,
Of
course.
When
Aurens
has
got
When
you've
got
what
Oh,
no,
I
shan't,
Auda.
Then
you
are
a
fool.
Maybe.
But
I
am
not
a
deserter.
Give
thanks
to
God,
Brighton,
that
when
he
made
you
a
fool,
You
are
an
impudent
rascal.
I
must
go,
Aurens,
before
I

Like
talking
to
a
brick
wall.
So,
what
will
you
do
now?
I'll
go
north.
That's
what
Allenby
Allenby
wanted
the
Arab
Then
that's
where
I'll
take
it.
Tell
Allenby
to
hurry
up,
or
we'll
be
Won't
we?

Train,
Farraj.
Yeah,
Aurens.
Hide
yourself,
my
friend.
Detonator.
All
right,
fetch
another.
Pardon,
Aurens.
I
put--

Farraj?
Farraj!

ALI:
What
happened?

He
cannot
ride,
If
they
take
him
alive,
you
Daud
will
be
angry
with
you.
Salute
him
for
me.


What
will
you
do
now?
Go
north.
With
twenty?
What
would
you
What
would
you
recommend?
Well,
he
hasn't
one-tenth
He's
lied,
in
fact.
Yes
and
no.
He
doesn't
claim
to
Then
there
is
an
No,
sir,
he
has
lied
about
that.
It's
his
army,
I
suppose.
Do
you
think
he's
No.
He
would
if
he
Not
my
line
of
country,
this,
sir.
What
matters
is
The
Turks
believe
it.
They
are
offering
Good
heavens.
Shouldn't
say
he
had
Well,
whatever
else,
Surely,
surely.
If
he's
still
going
north
I
wonder
if
they'd
What
about
next
year?
I
wouldn't
be
surprised.
They
think
he's
a
kind
of
prophet.
Now
may
I
speak?
Aurens,
one
more
failure
I
do
not
include
myself.
So
say
they
love
you.
The
more
reason
to
Give
them
something
to
do
They
must
move
mountains
for
That's
right.
That's
right.
Who
are
you
to
know
If
we'd
done
what
you
thought
could
be
done,
Whatever
I
ask
them
to
do
can
be
done.
That's
all.
Do
you
think
I'm
just
anybody,
Ali?
Do
you?
My
friends,
who
will
Who
will
come
with
me
into
Deraa?
Will
you
take
20
against
2000?
I'll
go
by
myself
if
I
have
to.
Because
I
told
the
the
Arab
revolt
would
be
in
Deraa
Or
perhaps
you
are
here...
for
the
English
generals.
Who
says
this?
Rumour.
That
is
not
an
argument.
Oh,
argument.
This
afternoon
I
will
take
while
the
Arabs
argue.
Aurens.
Can
you
pass
for
an
Arab
Yes.
If
one
of
you
would
lend


It's
madness.

What
are
you
looking
for?
Some
way
to
Be
patient
with

Do
you
not
see
how
Peace,
Ali,
I
am
invisible.
MAN:
Walk
on.
Halt!
You
and
you.

You.


You.


You
have

I
say
you
have
blue
eyes.
Are
you
Circassian?
How
old
are
you?
Twenty-seven,
effendi.
I
think.
You
look
older.
You

I

by

have

in
Deraa
now
If
they
posted
me
to
the
dark
side
isolated.
You
haven't
the
least
idea
No,
effendi.
Have
you?
No.
That
would
be
too...
lucky.

Where
did
you
get
that?
Oh,
it's
old,
effendi.
You
are
a
deserter.
Yes,
you
are
a
deserter.
But
from
which
army?
Not
that
it
matters
at
all.
A
man
cannot
be
always
in
uniform.
Your
skin
is
very
fair.
Beat

To
me!







Sleep.
Sleep.
Eat.
Eat.
You
have
a
body,
Good.
Then
sleep.

Better?
Much
better.
Rest,
rest.
Oh,
I've
learned
all
right.
I'm
going,
Ali.
Why?
Heavens.
Why?
I've
come
to
the
end
And
the
end
of
I'm
not
the
Arab
revolt,
A
man
can
be
whatever
I'm
sorry.
You
proved
it.
Look,
Ali.
Look.
That's
me.
What
colour
And
there's
nothing
A
man
can
do
whatever
He
can...
but
he
can't
want
This
is
the
stuff
that
You
may
as
well
know.
I
I
would've
told
them
who
I
am.
I
I
tried
to.
Well,
any

And
I'm
going
back
to
that
any
man
can
do.
Allenby's

Jerusalem.
I'll
make
easy
stages.
Oh,
yes.
Easy
stages.
Look,
Ali,
I
think
I

Can
I
take
this?
It
is
not
clean.
No,
but
it's
warm.
And
these...
having
led
them
here,
You
lead
them.
They're
yours.
And
let
me
go
back
to
mine.

I
say,
don't
forget
those

fives.
Hey.
Mind
if
I
join
you?
Honoured,
sir.
Good
to
be
back.
What's
doing
out
there?
Oh,
Arabia?
Nothing
much.
Wrong
time
of
year.
We're
settling
in
all
right,
sir.
Jolly
good.
Well,
I
have
to
go
up
there.
It's

Bloody

Yes,
probably.
Jolly
good

Good
morning,

I'll

you,

Hello.

You're

Or
is
it

Lawrence?
Sir.
Well,

Major
Lawrence

about
my
people
and
the
need
to
keep
them
And
the
French

too,
of

Yes,
general,
you
have
lied

I
know
this
treaty
Treaty,
sir?
He
does
it
better
But
then,
of
course,
You
really
don't

Then
what
the
devil's
this?
It's
my
request
for
release
For
what
reason?
Are
you
sure
you
haven't
No.
I
can
guess.
Well,
now...

an

And
let's
have

You
may
not
have
known,
but
If
we've
told
lies,
And
a
man
who
tells
lies,
But
a
man
who
tells
half-lies
The
truth
is,
I'm
an
ordinary
man.
You
might
have
told
me
that,
Dryden.
And
I
want
an
ordinary
job,
sir.
That's
my
reason
It's
personal.
Personal?
Personal?
You're
a
And
as
it
happens,
a
damned
important
one.
No,
and
if
you
don't
mind,
That's
my
reason
too.
Look,
Lawrence,
I'm
making
my
big
push
and
you
are
part
of
it.
Can
you
understand
that?
You're

don't

Nothing

so.

Well,

little
clash
