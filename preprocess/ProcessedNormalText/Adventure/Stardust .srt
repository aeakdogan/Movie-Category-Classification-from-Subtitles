Aphilosopher
once
asked,
"Are
we
human
"or
do
we
gaze
at
them
Pointless,
really.
Do
the
stars
gaze
back?
Now,
that's
a
question.
But
I'm
getting
ahead
of
myself.
Our
story
really
begins
here,
1
50
years
ago
in
London,
England,
where
a
letter
arrived,
It
had
come
from
a
country
boy
and
the
scientist
who
read
it
thought
it
But
he
duly
wrote
a
reply
politely
explaining
And
posted
it
to
the
boy
so
named,
the
boy
had
said,
A
wall
that,
according
to
local
folklore,
I'm
charged
with
guarding
the
portal
And
you're
asking
me
Yes.
Look,
do
you
see
No.
You
see
a
field.
No.
And
you
know
why?
Hundreds
of
years,
Hundreds
of
years,
-Well...
and
I'll
have
you
up
-Well,
that
sounds
rather
final.
-Better
just
go
home,
then,
I
suppose.
Give
my
best
to
your
father.
Stop!
Stop!
I
don't
deal
with
time-wasters.
Get
over
here
and
tend
this
stall.
I'm
off
to
The
Slaughtered
Prince
See
anything
you
like?
Definitely.
I
mean,
what
I
meant
was
these
ones,
How
much
are
they?
They
might
be
the
colour
of
your
hair.
Or
they
might
be
all
of
your
memories
I
can
check
if
you
like.
Anyway,
you
shouldn't
buy
the
bluebells.
Snowdrop.
It'll
bring
you
luck.
But
what
does
that
cost?
This
one
costs
a
kiss.
Is
she
gone?
Follow
me.
I'm
a
princess,
Will
you
liberate
me?
It's
an
enchanted
chain.
Sorry.
Well,
if
I
can't
liberate
you,
So,
the
scientist
was
wrong.
The
wall
had
successfully
done
its
job
of
hiding
The
young
man
returned
that
night
hoping
that
his
adventure
But
nine
months
later,
This
was
left
at
the
wall
for
you.
Tristan?
Don't
forget
the
flowers.
Yes.
I've
got
them.
Thank
you,
Father.
Eighteen
years
passed,
knowing
nothing
But
never
mind
This
is
the
story
of
a
much
greater
challenge
altogether.
For
to
achieve
it,
he
must
win
the
heart
-It's
him!
Humphrey?
-No,
it's
Tristan.
Did
I
leave
something
at
the
shop?
Did
I
leave
something
at
the
shop?
No.
I
just
thought
I
could
bring...
Tristan
Thorne,
shop
boy
by
day,
peeping
Tom
by
night.
Is
there
no
end
to
your
charms?
Humphrey,
Be
nice
to
the
poor
boy.
Were
those
for
Victoria?
You
were
always
useless
at
fencing
In
fact,
I'm
having
trouble
remembering
Humphrey,
that's
enough.
Are
you
all
right?
Yeah.
Yeah,
fine.
-Want
some
breakfast?
-Are
you
all
right?
Oh,
I
don't
know.
Oh,
really
good.
Really,
really
good.
Hello,
Tristan.
-Victoria.
-Yes.
Oh,
look,
I'm
sorry
about
last
night.
I
also
need
a
sack
of
potatoes
May
I
perhaps
see
you
tonight?
No,
but
you
may
walk
me
home.
Now?
Yes.
Yes,
I
can.
Father,
I
lost
my
job.
Father,
I
don't...
I
lost
my
job.
I'm
sorry.
-Father...
Yes,
so
I
heard.
Father,
I'm
sorry.
I...
Maybe
Mr
Monday
was
right.
-I'm
not
good
enough
for
Victoria.
You
really
want
to
know
Yeah.
Not
good.
Come
on.
I'm
wasting
my
time.
I'm
not
like
Humphrey.
Tristan,
I
can
tell
you
that
every
man
has
led
an
unremarkable
life.
So
you
don't
fit
with
the
popular
crowd.
-Tristan,
I
clearly
said...
I
have
something
for
you.
A
surprise.
No...
It's
not
my
birthday
for
another
week,
-I've
never
had
champagne
before.
My
God!
This
is
delicious!
How
did...
Well,
I'm
not
a
shop
boy.
God!
I
heard.
I'm
sorry.
No.
I
mean,
I'm
not
a
shop
boy.
And
now
I'm
not.
This
must
have
been
all
your
savings.
So?
I
can
make
more.
I
never
intended
to
stay
in
Wall,
There's
a
big
world
out
there,
Now
you
sound
just
like
Humphrey.
Do
you
know
he's
going
all
the
way
Ipswich?
Victoria,
I'm
talking
about
London
A
ring?
Why
is
he...
The
word
is
he's
planning
to
propose
He's
going
to...
And
you're
gonna
say
yes.
I
can't
exactly
say
no
"All
the
way
to
lpswich"?
Victoria,
for
your
hand
in
marriage,
-Really?
Victoria,
for
your
hand
in
marriage,
I
would
go
to
and
bring
you
back
your
weight
in
gold.
I
would.
I'd
go
to
Africa
and
bring
you
back
Or
I'd
go
to
the
Arctic
and
bring
you
back
its
head.
A
polar
bear's
head?
You're
funny,
Tristan.
People
like
you
and
people
like
me,
I
should
be
going.
It's
really
late.
Well,
hold
on,
then.
Okay.
Had
Tristan
known
then
he'd
have
shuddered
at
the
very
thought
of
an
audience
to
his
humiliation.
But,
fortunately
for
him,
nearly
every
star
in
the
sky
Iooking
in
earnest
at
the
land
where
the
King
of
all
Stormhold
which
was
a
coincidence
that
would
change
the
course
Where
is
Secundus?
He's
on
his
way,
Father.
Then
we
shall
wait.
Sorry
I'm
late,
Father.
Septimus.
Primus.
Tertius.
So,
to
the
matter
of
succession.
Of
my
seven
sons,
This
is
quite
a
break
with
tradition.
And
you
killed
them
all
for
your
throne
before
your
father,
the
King,
We
know,
Father.
And
cunning.
Most
importantly,
cunning.
-Secundus.
Look
through
the
window.
I
see
the
kingdom,
Father.
The
whole
of
Stormhold.
-And?
Maybe.
Look
up.
-Secundus.
You're
alive.
You're...
Stuck
like
this
I
was
that
close.
Well,
at
least
Oh,
please.
You're
not
annoyed
-I
mean,
that
was
10
years
ago.
Great
deal
of
good
it
did
you,
didn't
it,
Because
now,
of
course,
Oh,
sorry.
Wait.
No,
you're
not.
Una?
Una?
No,
Father,
it's
me,
your
son.
Tertius.
Where
is
your
sister,
Una?
Sorry,
Father.
-Septimus?
Tradition
dictates
the
throne
must
pass
Exactly,
Father.
So
why
would
I
kill
my
sister
Indeed.
Therefore,
we
shall
resolve
the
situation
Only
he
of
royal
blood
And
the
one
of
you
that
does
so
Oh,
Tristan!
A
shooting
star!
Beautiful.
More
beautiful
than
a
fancy
ring
Victoria,
for
your
hand
in
marriage,
I'd
cross
the
wall
You
can't
cross
the
wall.
Nobody
crosses
the
wall.
I'm
not
being
silly.
I'd
do
it.
For
you,
I'd
do
anything.
My
very
own
star.
It
seems
we
have
ourselves
You
have
exactly
one
week
Mormo!
Empusa!
Wake
up.
Now!
-What
is
it?
Where
are
the
Babylon
candles?
You
used
the
last
one,
Lamia,
Perhaps
we
can
obtain
another.
Has
your
mind
become
You
speak
as
if
such
things
I
know,
sister,
I
merely
thought...
You'd
have
us
hunting
while
some
other
witch
finds
our
star.
Fool.
There's
no
time
to
waste.
If
we
must
retrieve
it
on
foot,
Mormo,
we
need
information.
If
these
divinations
are
correct,
Four
centuries
we've
waited
for
this.
Which
of
us
shall
go,
then,
to
seek
it
-I've
his
kidney.
And
I've
his
heart.
You'll
be
needing
You'll
be
needing
-There's
not
much
left.
-Dunstan
Thorne.
Not
again.
Oh.
You
do
look
a
bit
like
your
father.
And
I
suppose
you
intend
Well,
you
can
forget
it.
Go
home.
Cross
the
wall
as
well
as
who?
No
one.
Nobody.
Nobody
crosses
the
wall.
Everybody
knows
that!
Yeah...
No,
no,
I
know.
Well,
I
better
just
head
Yeah.
-Right,
then.
Night,
Tristan.
Give
my
best
to
your
father.
Off
you
go.
I
thought
I
heard
you
come
in.
No,
I'm
fine.
-That
Humphrey
again?
Actually,
it
was
the
guard.
Tristan,
he's
97
years
old.
Well,
that's
given
him
plenty
of
time
Why,
may
I
ask,
I
might
ask
you
the
same
thing.
I
have
a
mother.
I
mean,
I
have
a
mother.
Oh,
I
hope
so.
I
certainly
like
to
think
so.
The
chain
you
cut.
Just
like
you
said.
And...
And
the
glass
flower.
She
told
me
it
would
bring
me
luck.
Thank
you.
This
was
also
in
the
basket.
It's
addressed
to
you.
Yep.
"My
dearest
Tristan,
please
know
that
Had
my
mistress
allowed
it,
My
dearest
wish
is
that
The
fastest
way
to
travel
To
use
it,
think
of
me
and
only
me.
I
will
think
of
you
every
day,
for
always.
"Your
mother."
Well,
do
you...
Do
you
have
a
light?
Mother?
Oh!
Oh,
Mother,
I'm
so...
I'm
so
sorry.
No,
I'm
not.
You're...
You're
not
my
mother?
Do
I
look
like
I'm
your
mother?
No.
Sorry.
Well,
are
you
all
right?
You
can
help
by
leaving
me
alone!
All
right.
Oh,
my
God.
I
was.
I
was
thinking
of
my...
But
then
Victoria
and
the
star
Oh,
excuse
me,
madam.
Sorry.
This
may
seem
strange,
but
-You're
funny.
This
must
be
where
it
fell.
Yeah,
this
is
where
it
fell.
It
is.
Or
if
you
want
to
be
really
specific,
up
there
is
where
came
out
of
nowhere
when
it
was
minding
its
own
business.
And
over
there
is
where
it
landed.
And
right
here,
this
is
where
it
got
hit
You're
the
star!
You're
the
star?
Really?
You're
the
star!
You're
the
star?
Really?
Oh,
wow.
I'm
sorry.
May
I
just
say
in
advance
-Sorry
for
what?
Now,
if
I
am
not
mistaken,
See,
you're
going
to
be
a
birthday
gift
But
of
course!
Nothing
says
romance
like
the
gift
I'm
not
going
anywhere
with
you.
Hurry.
You
should
be
You
must
find
the
royal
necklace
I
should
like
to
see
you
take
the
throne.
I
don't
doubt
Stormhold
would
be
Really?
Well,
that
is
fascinating.
-Don't
you
think,
Tertius?
Prince
Septimus!
Tertius.
Well...
Well.
Since
you're
all
here,
What
a
very
good
idea.
To
the
new
King
of
Stormhold,
whichever
of
you
fine
fellows
To
the
new
King
of
Stormhold.
You!
You
really
thought
that
you
were
king?
-You
killed
the
Bishop?
I
think
you'll
find
that
you
killed
the
Oh,
look,
when
you
finish
wrestling
may
I
suggest
you
return
Leave
the
quest
for
the
stone
to
me.
How
have
we
lived
this
way
In
my
absence,
I
expect
you
to
make
it
When
I
return
with
our
prize,
Never
fear,
my
sisters.
I
will
not
fail.
Don't
you
ever
sleep?
Not
at
night.
May
have
escaped
your
notice,
genius,
but
that's
when
stars
They're
coming
out,
shining,
Yeah,
well,
it
may
have
escaped
yours,
Coming
out
is
off
the
agenda.
Shining
has
been
suspended
Oh,
and
sleeping
during
the
day
Unless
you
have
some
magical
ability
Have
you
not
got
it
I'm
not
walking
anywhere!
Fine.
Sit
in
a
crater.
I
was
gonna
put
you
back
in
the
sky
but
clearly,
you'd
rather
sit
on
your
own
And
just
how
were
you
planning
I
find
the
fastest
way
to
travel
-You've
got
a
Babylon
candle.
-A
Babylon
candle.
You
said
"Bubbling."
Anyway,
I
was
going
to
give
Well,
that
barely
has
one
use
left.
So
be
grateful
I'm
not
using
it
right
now
Unless
you
have
a
better
way
of
Fine!
Help
me
up.
All
right.
All
right.
I'm
helping.
And
you
are
gonna
have
to
walk
Otherwise,
I'll
never
get
you
back
Don't
push
your
luck.
Don't
take
less
than
a
florin
for
him,
-Yes,
Mother.
And
don't
even
think
of
stopping
at
the
A
florin
for
your
goat,
boy.
Oh.
He's
a
bit
small
to
pull
your
cart.
You're
quite
right.
That's
much
better.
Bernard!
Bernard!
Get
on!
Who
goes
there?
What
do
you
want
with
me,
Oh,
do
shut
up.
I
know
what
you
are
and
I
swear
by
the
ordinances
of
the
that
I
mean
you
no
harm
this
day.
I
wish
to
share
your
meal.
Well,
one
can
never
be
too
careful.
-Anything
else?
What's
it
to
be?
What's
it
to
be?
Heads
or
tails?
Heads.
So,
stranger,
where
are
you
headed
off
to
I
seek
a
fallen
star.
She
fell
not
far
from
here.
And
when
I
find
her,
and
cut
out
her
heart
And
the
glory
of
our
youth
Fallen
star?
That's
the
best
news
I've
had
in
ages.
I
could
do
with
losing
So
whereabouts
did
you...
Limbus
grass!
You
dare
to
steal
truth
from
my
lips
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
a
big
How
do
you
know
my...
-Who
are
you?
I
shall
not
seek
the
star,
Seek
all
you
wish.
You
shall
not
see
the
star,
touch
it,
You
will
not
perceive
her
Pray
you
never
meet
me
again,
Oh,
right.
So
let
me
get
this
straight.
You
think
you
know
And
I
quote,
"l
just
do."
I
do,
though.
I
don't
know
why.
Maybe
it's
my
love
for
Victoria
-Please.
Yvaine!
My
name
is
Yvaine,
so...
How
many
times
do
I
have
to...
Would
you...
Yes,
yes.
Look,
we're...
The
wall's
north.
And
if
you
look
up
in
the
sky,
The
evening
star.
That's
so
weird.
That's
funny.
Hilarious.
No,
I'm
being...
Wait
that...
That
was
you!
Really?
What...
What
are...
-What
are
you
doing?
-Sitting
down.
I'm
tired.
We
agreed
we'd
stop
off
Come
on,
Tristan.
It's
midday.
I
never
stay
up
this
late!
Okay,
you...
Well,
then
I'll...
You
sleep.
What
are
you
doing?
What
does
it
look
like
I'm
doing?
Your
Highness,
the
soothsayer,
South,
you
said.
South
we
went.
Still
no
stone.
Do
you
now
propose
Sire,
I've
merely
relayed
to
you
I
can
do
no
more.
Well,
consult
them
again.
Wait.
Before
we
seek
the
stone,
Am
I
the
seventh
son?
Yes.
Another
question.
Is
my
favourite
colour
blue?
Yes.
Has
excessive
begging
or
pleading
to
spare
the
life
of
a
traitor?
What
does
that
mean?
-That
means
no.
Throw
them
again.
Do
you
work
for
my
brother?
So,
do
we
continue
west?
Tristan?
Who's
there?
Tristan,
is
that
you?
It's
not
funny.
Tristan?
Come
on.
Be
careful
how
much
magic
It's
beginning
to
show.
One
goat
and
a
small
enchantment.
Well,
even
using
the
ring
Better
you
call
on
us
only
in
dire
need.
And
use
your
runes
I
used
them
and
she
should
be
here.
But
now
It
is
because
you
must
stay
She
is
coming
to
you.
Oh,
be
warned,
Lamia.
Misery
has
drained
her.
Set
a
trap
that
ensures
her
heart
Yvaine!
Yvaine!
Oh,
you
idiot.
You
shall
become
human.
You
are
Billy,
the
innkeeper.
Now,
make
everything
ready.
I
mean,
who's
to
say
he'd
have
even
I
just
refuse
to
believe
who
could've
helped
me.
Going
on
and
on
and
on.
Tristan?
Please
protect
our
sister,
Tristan.
Yvaine
is
in
grave
danger.
The
unicorn
came
to
help
her.
But
now
they're
heading
into
a
trap.
No
star
is
safe
in
Stormhold.
The
last
to
fall,
400
years
ago,
was
captured
by
the
same
witches
They
tricked
her,
cared
for
her,
and
when
her
heart
they
cut
it
from
her
chest
and
ate
it.
There's
no
time
to
waste.

is
coming.
By
any
means
possible,
Run.
Whoa!
If
Septimus
insists
on
sending
a
boy
No,
no,
no,
wait,
please!
I
don't
know
a
Septimus.
Look
at
me,
look
at
me.
Please,
let
me
ride
with
you.
I'm
afraid
that's
impossible.
Well,
then
all
the
more
reason
There
may
come
a
time
when
you
need
Please.
Maybe
providence
sent
me
-Get
on.
Goodness
me,
my
dear.
We
have
food
and
drink,
a
warm
bed
How
do
you
like
your
bath?
I
honestly
don't
know.
Then
let
me
choose
for
you,
and
I'll
have
my
husband
Billy?
Now,
let's
get
you
out
Feeling
better?
Much.
Thank
you.
The
warm
water's
actually
done
me
You
see?
And
your
leg?
Any
improvement?
That
is
extraordinary.
It's
the
very
least
I
could
do.
You
seem
happier
in
yourself,
too.
I
do
feel
happier.
Less
troubled.
Wonderful.
Nothing
like
a
nice
soak
Now,
I'm
only
a
simple
innkeeper's
wife,
but
I've
been
told
I'd
be
glad
to
give
you
a
massage.
What's
a
massage?
Never
had...
Well,
bless
my
soul.
Nothing
like
a
massage
to
send
you
off
I
do
have
trouble
sleeping
at
night.
Lie
on
your
back,
dear.
Why
not
close
your
eyes?
You'll
drift
off
better
that
way.
Hello!
Service!
Maybe
we
should
carry
on
especially
if
this
stone
is
as
close
I'll
give
it
one
more
try.
Relax
here,
my
love.
I'll
be
back
just
as
soon
as
At
last.
We
require
accommodation.
Please
help
my
friend
Hello!
Oh.
I'm
accustomed
to
better
service,
but
you're
awake
now
Prepare
your
best
room.
-She
got
the
stone.
I'll
thank
you
not
to
bother
my
guest,
sir.
Glass
of
wine?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
No.
Until
my
brother
is
dead,
Though
my
friend
in
the
stables
Your
best
room,
perhaps?
Of
course.
I'm
sorry.
I
presumed
that...
Travelling
alone,
are
you?
I've
just
stabled
my
four
black
stallions
Well,
I
say
mine.
Thank
you.
That's
so
kind,
thank
you
very
much.
Bernard.
There
was
not
a
horse
or
beast
So
much
so
that
in
his
youth,
which
was
comical.
When
he
passed,
She's
got
the
stone!
-She's
got
it!
And
it's
the
largest
in
all
of
Stormhold,
How
nice
for
you.
If
you'll
excuse
me.
Wait.
That
stone
you're
wearing.
It
can't
be.
-Oh,
finally.
-Well
done.
Come
here.
Let
me
see
it.
You
have
no
idea
I
am
Primus,
the
first
born
of
Stormhold
Bring
me
the
stone!
Now!
Prince
Primus!
Don't
touch
anything
-Are
you
all
right?
-Are
you
all
right?
Get
him!
The
burning
golden
heart
is
so
much
better
Even
so,
better
than
no
heart
at
all.
Yvaine?
No!
-What
the
hell
did
you
do?
"Think
of
home!"
That
was
a
great
plan!
You
thought
of
your
home
and
now
we're
halfway
between
the
two!
Oh,
you
stupid
cow!
You
just
said
"home"!
If
you
wanted
me
to
think
of
your
home,
Some
crazy
lady
and
you
wanted
Perhaps
you'd
like
it
in
writing!
Look,
Captain
Shakespeare!
A
couple
of
Lightning
Marshals!
They
don't
look
Why
else
would
anyone
be
up
here
"Why
else
would
anyone
be
up
here
Well,
let's
think.
Maybe
for
the
same
godforsaken
reason
Now,
who
are
you?
Let's
see
if
a
night
on
our
lovely
brig
-Get
them
in
the
brig!
Get
them
into
the
brig
and
the
rest
of
We've
got
lightning
to
catch!
Come
on!
-They're
going
to
kill
us,
aren't
they?
You
know,
it's
funny.
I
used
to
watch...
I
used
to
watch
people
I
envied
them.
You
ever
heard
the
expression,
What?
So
ending
up
with
my
heart
No.
No,
I
didn't...
Look,
I
admire
you
dreaming.
Shop
boy
like
me,
I
could
never
have
imagined
in
order
to
have
wished
for
it.
I
just
thought
and
take
it
home,
and
that
would
be
it.
And
you
got
me.
If
there's
one
thing
I've
learned
it's
that
people
aren't
There
are
shop
boys
and
there
are
boys
who
just
happen
And
trust
me,
Tristan,
You
saved
my
life.
Thank
you.
Well,
well,
well.
The
last
brother
dead.
Which
means
that
I'm
king.
I'm
king!
Not
yet,
brother.
Damn.
I
still
need
the
stone.
-Your
brother
doesn't
have
it?
Where
is
my
stone?
I
don't...
The
man,
see,
your
brother...
Yeah.
The
girl
had
it.
The
girl
had
it.
-What
girl?
A
girl.
She
got
away.
but
your
brother,
A
trap?
Set
by
who?
A
woman
you
should
pray
She's...
She's
gone.
This
woman
wanted
my
stone?
No.
She
wanted
the
girl's
heart.
She
said
the
girl
was
a
star
and
Eat
it?
Oh,
my
God.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
this
means?
Everlasting
life.
King
forever.
It's
not
here,
sire.
This
idiot's
coming
with
us.
-Ask
again.
and
the
answer
is
still
the
same.
Well,
she
can't
remain
so
forever.
Inform
me
Immediately!
Do
you
understand?
Watch
your
tongue,
sister!
Lost
her
and
broken
the
knife!
Even
if
you
apprehend
her,
Perhaps
you
should
return
now
Don't
be
absurd.
I'll
bring
her
home
Be
sure
everything
is
ready
Tell
me
about
Victoria
then.
Well,
she...
There's
nothing
more
to
tell
you.
Because
the
little
I
know
about
love
It's
not
something
you
can
buy.
Hang
on.
This
was
a
way
for
me
And
what's
she
doing
to
prove
Well...
Look,
Yvaine,
you'll
understand
Provided
we
don't
get
murdered
Murdered
by
pirates.
I
can't
quite
decide
We've
located
the
sky
vessel.
It's
headed
north
and
you
are
no
longer
There's
someone
following
your
tracks!
A
witch?
A
warlock?
A
prince
and
he's
catching
you
up!
So,
this
is
the
part
where
you
tell
me
Or
I'll
snap
her
pretty
little
fingers
My
name
is
Tristan
Thorne.
-This
is
my
wife,
Yvaine.
Far
too
young
and
radiant
It's
share
and
share
alike
If
you
dare
even
touch
her...
You
may
think
you're
showing
but
if
you
talk
back
to
me
again,
you
impertinent
little
pup!
-Sir?
Let's
see.
Maybe
we'll
watch
you
dance
Or
perhaps
I'll
just
tip
you
over
the
side
It's
a
very
long
way
down.
Plenty
of
time
to
reminisce
Please,
look,
we're
just
trying
back
to
a
place
called
Wall,
What
did
you
say?
I
said
we
were
trying
to
get
home
That's
one
lie
too
many,
my
son.
-Wall?
What's
he
saying?
Thought
you
could
just
wander
-He
is.
Yeah,
he's
gonna...
All
right,
go,
on
the
deck,
on
the
deck,
Big
mistake,
Mr
Thorne!
-No!
No!
You
brute!
-You
murderer!
You
pig!
I'm
taking
the
girl
to
my
cabin,
anyone
who
disturbs
me
-will
get
the
same
treatment!
No,
you
idiot!
Oh,
yeah.
Captain's
busy.
So
should
you
be.
Get
in
there,
wench!
So,
that
went
well,
I
thought.
Now,
tell
me
news
I
want
to
hear
absolutely
everything.
Hang
on.
And
where
in
God's
name
Oh,
it
works
every
time.
An
ounce
of
bargaining,
a
soupcon
of
intimidation,
et
voil!
The
perfect
recipe
without
ever
having
to
spill
Ever
try
to
get
blood
stains
out
Right.
I
still
don't
understand
Tristan,
dear
boy,
when
I'm
done,
your
own
mother
won't
recognise
you.
Now,
we've
no
time
to
waste.
We
have
only
two
hours
First
and
foremost...
It'll
be
so
good
to
see
you
So
very
small-town
errand-boy.
Here.
Trs
you.
I
wore
it
as
a
younger
man.
You
know
the
day
you
do,
be
oh,
so
de
la
mode.
Now,
you,
darling.
I
have
some
lovely
dresses.
Oh,
no,
really,
I'm
fine.
Honey,
you're
wearing
a
bathrobe.
Now,
England,
England.
-You're
not
from
England.
But
from
my
earliest
youth,
People
always
told
me
they
were
but
my
heart
told
me
they
were
true.
As
a
boy,
I'd
scurry
away
while
he
did
his
deals
dream
of,
perhaps,
crossing
it
one
day,
Really?
So
you...
Oh,
yes.
-Hair.
Mind
you,
I
did
my
best
to
fit
in.
Tried
to
make
my
father,
Forged
a
decent
reputation
and
cold-blooded
killer.
But
my
father
died.
I
always
promised
him
keep
the
old
girl
flying.
You
have
no
idea
the
lightness
being
able
to
confide
in
you
The
pressure
of
maintaining
the
for
the
sake
of
the
crew,
I
don't
know.
Sometimes...
You
see,
I'm
very
much
Even
chose
the
name
specially.
See,
I'm
thinking
My
enemies
and
crew
are
thinking,
It's
little
things
like
that
make
me
happy.
I
don't
understand
that.
Surely
it
would
make
you
happier
Why
fight
to
be
accepted
by
people
Yeah.
Exactly.
Port
ahoy!
Ready
the
lightning
barrels!
Hurry
up.
Yeah.
Doesn't
seem
very
fresh.
Shall
I
give
you
a
little
taste,
No,
no.
Oh,
there
you
go.
Brilliant.
Like
they're
cheap.
I
think
it's
still
crackling,
I
think
it's
still
crackling,
-So,
name
your
best
price.
Ten
thousand
bolts
Yeah,
but
it's
difficult
to
shift,
If
I
get
the
Revenue
Men
in
here
Best
price,
150
guineas.
Gentlemen,
put
the
merchandise
-Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
One
minute.
-Oh,
he's...
Seeing
as
I'm
feeling
I'll
settle
for
200.
Two
hundred?
Okay.
Have
you
had
your
head
in
that?
Has
he
been
sailing
up
-You're
being
very
rude.
-Two
hundred.
-Two
hundred.
I'm
changing
my
number.
-Did
I
hear
200?
-You
said
200.
Okay,
one-nine-five.
Final
offer.
One-nine-five
it
is.
Brilliant.
Put
it
in
the
back.
Unbelievable.
Here.
Yes?
Can
I
help
you?
Nosy.
Have
you
heard
any
of
these
rumours
Everyone's
talking
about
it.
You
get
your
hands
on
one
of
them,
-Fallen
star?
-Nothing
on
your
travels?
Not
even
a
little
sniff
of
a
whisper?
Everyone's
going
on
about
it
Which
market?
Yeah.
Well,
Ferdy,
you're
wasting
your
time
from
the
kind
of
pond
scum
-Well,
if
it...
Oh,
yeah?
What
were
you
saying,
then?
Oh,
what
a
wonderful
woman
How
the
world
wouldn't
be
You
look
great.
But,
you
two,
you
have
business
Come
on.
Captain
Shakespeare.
Stand
down!
Meet
my
nephew,
Tristan
Thorne.
He'll
be
joining
us
for
our
journey
home.
I
have
the
perfect
gift
Oh...
Right,
you
lazy
dogs!
Let's
get
young
Tristan
Touch.
I'm
impressed.
Yvaine,
I
know
what
you
are.
No,
no.
Have
no
fear.
No
one
on
this
vessel
will
harm
you,
Your
emotions
give
you
away,
Yvaine.
You've
been
glowing
and
I
think
you
know
why.
Of
course
I
know
why
I'm
glowing.
-And
what
do
stars
do
best?
-Now
try.
-See?
Due
west,
you
say?
And
you're
certain
Yeah.
You're
sure?
Absolutely
sure?
I'd
cross
my
heart
if
I
had
one.
-Brilliant.
you
two-faced
dog.
I
can
get
you
one
of
them,
actually.
They
can
watch
the
back
I
can
get
you
anything
you
want.
What
are
the
chances
of
getting
That
one's
slim.
Although,
I
did
know
a
girl
once,
I'm
a
ladies'
man.
...who
had
a
sister...
I
think
it
was
a
woman.
Oh,
she
was
terrible.
Enough.
Hold
on
tight!
So
there's
the
road
you'll
need
for
Wall.
Good
luck
on
your
journey
home,
And
good
luck
to
you,
Tristan,
Oh,
how
can
we
ever
thank
you
enough
Don't
mention
it.
Reputations,
you
know.
Oh,
and
Tristan,
just
remember...
Just
think
about
it.
Well,
give
my
regards
to
England.
Mind
you
don't
wear
that
wench
out,
What
did
he
say
to
you?
What
did
he
say
when?
Just
then.
When
he
whispered
to
you.
No...
No,
he...
He
was
just
saying
to
get
you
a
Babylon
candle.
Barter
for
it,
you
know.
For
the
last
time,
where
is
the
girl?
The
girl
with
the
stone!
-Are
you
mocking
me?
'Cause
if
you
are,
believe
me,
What
a
freak.
Clean
this
thoroughly.
Bollocks.
If
you
have
quite
finished
on
your
rather
you
might
like
to
know
that
She's
back
on
land.
I
know,
damn
it.
No
matter.
We
have
found
her.
If
you
take
the
shortcut
you
should
arrive
in
time
Yvaine.
-Are
you
trying
to
break
my
leg
again?
I
just...
I
can't
risk
people
seeing
you.
But
at
this
rate,
if
we
keep
stopping...
Yvaine.
We're
making
good
time.
Aren't
you
tempted?
Tempted?
By
what?
Immortality.
Let's
say
it
wasn't
my
heart.
Not
me.
Just
a
star
you
didn't
know.
You
seriously
think
I
could
kill
anyone?
I
mean,
even
if
I
could...
I
imagine
it
would
be
kind
of
lonely.
Well,
maybe
if
you
had
someone
Someone
you
love.
Maybe
then
it
might
be
different.
Come
on,
I
think
we're
safe.
Now
remember,
Captain
Shakespeare
-What
the
hell
is
this?
My
name
is
Prince
Septimus.
And
you're
going
to
tell
me
All
right,
twinkletoes.
You
know,
you
sort
of
glitter
sometimes.
Let's
see
if
you
can
work
it
out
What
do
stars
do?
Attract
trouble?
That's...
All
right,
I'm
sorry.
All
right,
let
me...
Let
me...
Is
it...
Do
they
know
exactly
how
-How
long
will
that
take?
But
we
don't
have
two
days.
Yes,
it
is.
Well
remembered.
-Nice
cup
of
Earl
Grey.
Did
he
hurt
you,
Captain?
Did
he
hurt
you,
Captain?
Did
you
tell
him
So
what's
the
problem?
It's
my
reputation.
No.
No,
no.
Don't
be
silly.
Nonsense.
It's
all
right,
Captain.
We
always
knew
you
were
a
whoopsie.
-You'll
always
be
our
captain,
Captain.
Captain.
Yeah.
Let's
go,
let's
go.
Prince
Septimus,
Oh,
really?
Go
on!
I
met
that
woman.
He
said
she
trades
at
the
market
-We
could
hitch
a
lift.
-You
sure?
Wait!
Sorry!
That's
my
flower.
Eighteen
years
Give
it
to
me
now!
How
dare
you?
Oh.
Perhaps
I
was
mistaken.
It's
all
right.
It's
obviously
very
valuable
to
you,
in
exchange
for
what
I
need.
-A
Babylon
candle?
A
Babylon
candle?
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Really?
Well,
can
you
give
us
a
lift
then?
Well,
why
didn't
you
say
so
For
that
flower,
I
can
offer
you
passage.
-Food
and
lodging
on
the
way?
I
swear
that
you
will
arrive
at
the
wall
in
the
exact
same
condition
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
Some
kind
of
lucky
charm?
A
very
lucky
charm
indeed.
Protection.
In
fact,
the
exact
same
thing
that
-Oh,
my
God!
What
did
you
do?
You
shall
not
see
the
star,
touch
it,
Though
I'll
keep
me
word.
There.
Would
I
be
correct
in
thinking
that
Then
I'd
like
to
tell
you
You
look
like
the
wrong
end
of
a
dog.
And
I
swear,
I'll
be
your
personal
poltergeist!
Tristan?
If
you
can
understand
me,
You
know
when
I
said
Well,
that
wasn't
true.
I
know
a
lot
about
love.
I've
seen
it.
And
it
was
the
only
thing
that
made
All
those
wars.
Pain
and
lies.
Hate.
Made
me
want
to
turn
away
But
to
see
the
way
that
mankind
loves.
I
mean,
you
could
search
and
never
find
anything
more
beautiful.
So,
yes,
I
know
that
But
I
also
know
it
can
be
unpredictable,
unexpected,
uncontrollable,
unbearable
and,
well,
And
what
I'm
trying
to
say,
Tristan,
is
I
think
I
love
you.
My
heart,
it
feels
like
Like
it
doesn't
belong
to
me
any
more.
And
if
you
wanted
it,
No
gifts,
no
goods,
Nothing
but
knowing
you
love
me,
too.
Just
your
heart
in
exchange
for
mine.
The
wall
is
one
mile
that
way.
There.
Though
the
walk
might
take
Transformation
tends
to
leave
the
brain
You...
Oh!
I
warned
you.
Save
your
strength.
I've
been
so
worried
about
you.
Victoria.
I
think
I
preferred
"Mother."
Come
on.
There's
an
inn
over
there.
I
think
you
need
a
bath
before
you
present
me
to
her.
Come
on.
Come.
-Come
on,
Tristan.
It's
not
that
far.
-Excuse
me?
-I
think
you're
in
my
bath.
I'm
not...
Honestly,
I'm
not
looking.
All
right,
you
can
open
them
now.
Did
you
really
mean
What
l...
But...
But
you
were
a
mouse!
You
were
a
mouse!
You
wanted
cheese!
I
asked
you
to
give
me
a
sign.
And
risk
you
being
too
embarrassed
You
want
to
know
what
the
Captain
He
told
me
that
my
true
love
And
he
was
right.
Hey,
guys!
Guys,
come
on!
Come
on,
No,
thank
you.
-Pervert!
-lronic,
isn't
it?
Septimus
will
be
here
by
the
morning,
find
the
girl,
get
the
stone
So
unjust.
Still,
at
least
we
will
be
free.
You're
very
close.
One
mile
from
the
gap
in
the
wall.
You
speak
as
if
this
is
good
news.
Do
I
need
to
remind
you
that
Wall
If
she
crosses
the
threshold
our
star
becomes
nothing
more
Then
I
suggest
you
hurry
up!
What?
Oh,
what
do
you
want?
Sorry.
Ask
me
again
No,
I
can't.
I
have
to
go.
Look,
-please,
can
you
give
her
a
message?
You
know,
that's
the
first
time
I
can't
believe
it.
Tristan?
Have
you
seen
my
friend?
He
left
absurdly
early.
He
left?
He
told
me
to
tell
you
because
he's
sorry,
and
he
wants
to
spend
What?
-Are
you
sure?
Hey!
Hey,
wait!
Wait!
Happy
birthday.
Tristan.
What
happened
to
you?
I
found
the
star.
I
can't
believe
you
did
it.
Where's
my
star?
Can
I
see
it?
-ls
it
beautiful?
Well,
it's
awfully
small.
Well,
that's
just
a
little
piece.
Well...
Well,
then
forget
about
the
star.
It's
not
the
star
that
I
want.
You
know
what
I
want.
Yeah.
I
do.
You
want
to
grow
up
-Humphrey.
You
must
have
a
death
wish.
Humphrey.
Humphrey,
it's
all
right.
She's
all
yours.
You
really
are
a
perfect
couple.
Well,
why
would
I
want
this?
Yvaine?
She
can't
cross
the
wall.
Go
on!
Stop!
Stop!
What?
If
you
set
foot
on
human
soil,
Wretched
slattern!
Planning
to
enter
Wall,
were
you?
If
death
is
what
you
wish,
my
dear,
Are
you
talking
to
me?
You.
Small
world.
Anyhow,
no,
I
wasn't.
What
star?
My
slave
girl's
no
star.
If
she
was,
a
long
time
ago,
trust
me.
Trust
you?
Not
a
mistake
What's
it
to
be,
Ditchwater
Sal?
-Oh,
God.
Time
to
go.
I
think
you'll
find
she
is.
It's
all
right.
You
can
come,
too.
You
can
ride
in
the
carriage
or
What
happened?
Be
my
guest.
I
quit.
Eighty
years
What
I
should
have
been
worrying
about
was
those
people
All
right,
What
happened?
Oh,
where
to
start?
No!
Come
on!
Go
on!
The
star!
And
who
else?
A
slave
for
us.
It
will
be
nice
to
when
we've
finished
with
our
little
guest.
Oh,
good
work,
sister.
And
just
in
time,
I
see!
You
look
awful!
Who
are
you?
What
business
do
you
have
here?
Septimus?
I
knew
your
brother,
Primus.
Unless
you
wish
to
meet
him
I
suggest
you
answer
my
question.
I
might
ask
you
the
same
thing.
There
are
four
of
them.
Do
as
I
say
and
we
may
stand
a
chance.
Wait.
You
don't.
Why?
Do
you
have
a
choice?
-No.
Get
off
me!
Get
off!
-Una?
-Una!
Tristan!
No!
Tristan!
I'm
your...
I'm
your...
I'm
your
mother.
I'm
your
mother.
-Rather
well.
Oh!
Let's
put
out
those
flames.
Shall
we?
So,
what
happens
now?
We
have
to
learn
to
live
with
each
other.
Forever?
Let's
get
on
with
it.
Be
the
man
that
I
know
you
are.
-Get
outside.
Go.
-Tristan!
Get
off!
Get
out!
So,
what's
it
to
be,
Prince
Charming?
Septimus?
Tristan!
Youth.
Beauty.
It
all
seems
meaningless
now.
My
sisters
are
dead!
Everything
I
cared
about
gone.
Go.
Go!
No!
I
owe
you
thanks,
boy.
What
use
was
her
heart
to
me
And
you
got
rid
of
my
sisters
-Hold
me
tight
and
close
your
eyes.
What
do
stars
do?
Shine.
-Bravo!
Very
good.
Why
didn't
you
do
that
earlier?
I
couldn't
have
done
that
without
you.
I
thought
I'd
lost
you.
But
you
came
back.
Of
course
I
did.
I
love
you.
Come
on.
Tristan.
The
last
surviving
male
heir
It's
you,
Tristan.
But
if
he's
the
new
King
of
Stormhold,
I
crown
thee
King
Tristan
of
Stormhold.
Yeah!
My
gift
to
you.
To
you
both.
Thank
you.
They
ruled
for
80
years.
But
no
man
can
live
forever,
except
he
who
possesses
And
Yvaine
had
given
hers
When
their
children
and
grandchildren
it
was
time
to
light
the
Babylon
candle.
And
they
still
live
happily
ever
after.
