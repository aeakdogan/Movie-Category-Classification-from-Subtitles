LARA:











JOR-EL:
Do
you
not
understand?
We
may
only
have
a
matter
of
weeks.
Harvesting
the
core
was
suicide.
...the
process
of
implosion.
...were
exhausted.
Look
to
the
stars,
like
our
ancestors
did.
There
are
habitable
worlds
within
reach.
Are
you
seriously
suggesting
No.
Everybody
here
is
already
dead.
Give
me
control
of
the
Codex.
There
is
still
hope.
I
have
held
that
hope
in
my
hands.

This
council
has
been
disbanded.
On
whose
authority?
Mine.
The
rest
of
you
will
be
tried
-
What
are
you
doing,
Zod?
This
is
madness.
...years
ago.
These
lawmakers...
...with
their
endless
debates...
...have
lead
Krypton
to
ruin.
And
if
your
forces
prevail...
...you'll
be
the
leader
of
nothing.
Help
me
save
our
race.
We'll
start
anew.
We'll
sever...
...the
degenerative
bloodlines
And
who
will
decide
You?
Don't
do
this,
El.
The
last
thing
I
want
You
have
abandoned
the
principles
You've
taken
up
the
sword...
...against
your
own
people.
I
will
honor
the
man
you
once
were,
Zod...
...not
this
monster
you've
become.
Take
him
away.
Sir?
Is
everything
all
right?
Out
of
the
way.
I
said--
Get
me
Lara.
Jor.
Behind
you.

JOR-EL:
I'll
be
with
you
as
soon
as
I
can.
H'Raka!

Hyah!
-
Can
you
see
the
Codex?
But
I'm
compelled
to
warn
you.
Breaching
the
genesis
chamber
Nobody
cares
anymore,
Kelex.

SOLDIER:
...surrender
the
Codex.
Unh!
Ahhh!

Easy,
H'Raka.

JOE-EL:
-
We
have.
â€œjust
as
you
said
it
would.
JOE-EL:
His
cells
will
drink
its
radiation.
It's
a
seemingly
intelligent
population.
He'll
be
an
outcast.
A
freak.
They'll
kill
him.
How?
He'll
be
a
god
to
them.
LARA:
He'll
die
out
there...
...alone.
I
can't
do
it.
I
thought
I
could,
but...
-
Lara.
Krypton
is
doomed.
It's
his
only
chance
now.
It's
our
people's
only
hope.

What
is
it,
Kelex?
KELEX:
Five
attack
ships
Citadel's
defenses
I'll
upload
the
Codex.
No,
wait.
Lara.
Just
let
me
look
at
him.
We'll
never
get
to
see
him
walk.
Never
hear
him
say
our
names.
But
out
there...
...amongst
the
stars...
...he
will
live.

Goodbye,
my
son.
Our
hopes
and
dreams
travel
with
you.
Concentrate
fire
on
the
main
doors.
KELOR:
-
The
phantom
drives
are
coming
online.
FAORA:
We
have
identified
an
engine
ignition
A
launch.
Hold
this
platform,
commander.
I
know
you
stole
the
Codex,
Jor-El.
Surrender
it...
...and
I'll
let
you
live.
This
is
a
second
chance
for
all
of
Krypton...
...not
just
the
bloodlines
you
deem
worthy.
What
have
you
done?
We've
had
a
child,
Zod.
A
boy
child.
Krypton's
first
natural
birth
in
centuries.
And
he
will
be
free.
Free
to
forge
his
own
destiny.
Heresy.
Destroy
it.
Ah!



ZOD:
...listen
to
me.
The
Codex
is
Krypton's
future.
Abort
the
launch.
No!
ZOD:
...where
have
you
sent
him?

His
name...
...is
Kal...
...son
of
El.
And
he's
beyond
your
reach.
Bring
that
ship
down.
Target
locked.
SOLDIER
:
Your
forces
are
surrounded.
LOR-EM:
...for
the
crimes
...the
Council
has
sentenced
you
...to
three
hundred
cycles
Do
you
have
any
last
words?
You
won't
kill
us
yourself!
You
wouldn'l
sully
your
hands!
...to
a
black
hole
for
eternity!
Jor-El
was
right.
You're
a
pack
of
fools,
And
you.
You
believe
your
son
is
safe?
I
will
find
him.
I
will
reclaim
I
will
find
him.
I
will
find
him,
Lara.
I
will
find
him!
Argh!

KELOR:
There
is
no
refuge,
Kelor.
Jor-El
was
right.
This
is
the
end.
Make
a
better
world
than
ours,
Kal.


Watch
it,
dumb-ass!
Keep
your
eyes
open
Where
the
hell
did
they
find
you,

Are
you
listening,

I
asked
if
you
could
tell
me
who
first...
...settled
Kansas.


Are
you
all
right,
Clark?


RAMPLING:
Clark.
Clark!
Clark,
come
out
of
there.
Leave
me
alone.
Clark,
I

called

Clark?

The

MARTHA:
Just,
um...
...focus
on
my
voice.
Pretend
ifs
an
island...
...out
in
the

Can
you
see

I
see
it.
Then
swim

What's

Clark.
MARTHA:

Did
you
get
everything
I
need?
WOMAN:

PETE:
What
do
you
think?
You
see
the

Leave
him
alone,

I
wanna
hear
what
he
has
to

Come
on...

SCREAMING]






HELEN:
He
was
in
the
bus.
-
He
saw
what
Clark
did.
-
I'm
sure
what
he
thought
he
saw
was--
This
was
providence.

I
think
you're
blowing
it
out
of
proportion.
No,
I'm
not.
Lana
saw
it
too.
And
the
Fordham
boy.
This
isn't
the
first
time...
...Clark's
done
something
like
this.
I
just
wanted
to
help.
I
know
you
did,
but
we
talked
about
this.
Right?
Right?
We
talked
about
this.
You
have...
Clark,
you
have
to
keep
this
side
What
was
I
supposed
to
do?
Maybe.
There's
more
at
stake
here
than
just
our
lives,
When
the
world...
When
the
world
finds
out
what
you
can
do
Our
beliefs,
our
notions
of...
...what
it
means
to
be
human.
You
saw
how
Pete's
mom
reacted,
right?
She
was
scared,
Clark.
Why?
People
are
afraid
Is
she
right?
Did
God
do
this
to
me?
Tell
me.
JONATHAN:
We
were
sure
the
government
...but
no
one
ever
came.
This
was
in
that
chamber
with
you.
I
took
it
to
a
metallurgist...
...at
Kansas
State.
He
said
whatever
it
was
made
from
Didn't
even
exist
on
the
periodic
table.
That's
another
way
of
saying...
...that
it's
not
from
this
world,
Clark.
And
neither
are
you.
You're
the
answer,
son.
You're
the
answer
to
I
don't
wanna
be.
And
I
don't
blame
you,
son.
It'd
be
a
huge
burden
for
anyone
to
bear.
But
you're
not
just
anyone,
Clark,
That
you
were
sent
here
for
a
reason.
All
these
changes
that
you're
One
day
you're
gonna
think
of
them
...you
have
to
make
a
choice.
A
choice
of
whether
to
stand
proud
Can't
I
just
keep
pretending
I'm
your
son?
You
are
my
son.
But
somewhere
out
there
you've...
You
have
another
father
too,
And
he
sent
you
here...
...for
a
reason,
Clark.
And
even
if
it
takes
you
the
rest
of
your
life,
...to
find
out
what
that
reason
is.
WOMAN
:
I
fell
into
a
ring
of
fire
MEN
1:
Wait
a
second.
MAN
2:
Somebody
found
something
-
Aircom's
making
runs
out
there
all
week.
-
You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
The
Americans
are
there
too,
CHRISSY:
Anything
else?
-
Whatever
that
means.
LUDLOW:
Oh,
come
on,
Chrissy.
-
Sit
down.
Hey.
Leave
her
alone,
man.

Or
what,
tough
guy?
Or
I'm
gonna
have
to
ask
you
to
leave.
I
think
I'll
probably
just
leave

Ooh.
Oh,
there
he
is.
CHRISSY:
LUDLOW:

Strike.


LOIS:
Hi.
Miss
Lane.
How
you
doing?
-
Good.
How
far
to
the
station?
-
Camp's
just
over
the
rise.
I'll
walk
you
over.
Joe
can
take
your
bags.
Joe.
Help
her
out.
LOIS:
I
gotta
confess,
Miss
Lane...
...I'm
not
a
fan
of
the
Daily
Planet.
But
those
pieces
you
wrote
when
you
were
Well,
they
were
pretty
impressive.
Well,
what
can
I
say?
I
get
writer's
block

HARDY:
I'm
Colonel
Hardy,
U.S.
Northcom.
...from
DARPA.
-
You're
early.
We
were
expecting
you
tomorrow.
Which
is
why
I
showed
up
today.
Look,
let's
get
one
thing
straight,
The
only
reason
I'm
here
...and
the
appellate
court
overruled
So
if
we're
done
measuring
dicks...
...can
you
have
your
people
SEKOWSKY:
...pinged
the
anomaly
first.
The
ice
shelf
plays
hell
-
But
there's
something
there.
Soviet-era?
Doubtful.
That's
300
meters.
Considerably
larger
than
anything
But
herds
the
spooky
pan.
The
ice
surrounding
the
object...
...it's
nearly
twenty
thousand
years
old.
HARDY:
Try
not
to
wander.
Temperatures
drop
to
minus
40
Wouldn't
find
your
body
till
after
spring.
And
there
you
go.
What
if
I
need
to
tinkle?
There's
a
bucket
in
the
corner.

Where
the
hell
are
you
going?


Hello'?



CLARK:
It's
all
right,
it's
all
right,

You're
hemorrhaging
internally...
...and
if
I
don't
cauterize
this
bleed...
How
can-l?
I
can
do
things
that
other
people
can't.
Now
hold
my
hand.
This
is
gonna
hurt.





LOIS:
What
Colonel
Hardy
...was
a
Soviet-era
submarine...
...was
actually
something
An
isotope
analysis
of
the
surrounding
...had
been
trapped
in
the
glacier
As
for
my
rescuer?
He
disappeared
during
A
background
check
revealed
...and
identity
had
been
falsified.
The
questions
raised
by
my
rescuer's...
"existence
are
frightening
to
contemplate...
...but
I
also
know
what
I
saw.
"And
I
have
arrived
...that
the
object
and
its
occupant...
...did
not
originate
on
Earth."
I
can't
print
this,
Lois.
What
about
the
contractors
...my
story?
Of
course
they
are.
They're
supposed
to.
It's
the
Pentagon.
Perry,
it's
me
we're
talking
about.
-
I'm
a
Pulitzer
Prize-winning
reporter.
-
Print
it
or
I
walk.
You're
under
contract.

I'm
not
running
a
story

Never
gonna
happen.
That's
a
Scotch,
straight-up,
for
the
lady.
LOIS:
My
editor
won't
print
it,
Got
it.
But
didn't
you
once
describe
my
site...
...as
a
creeping
cancer
of
falsehoods?
I
stand
by
my
words,
Woodburn,
...out
there.
Because
I
want
my
mystery
man
COMPUTER:
Guiding
presence
authenticated.
All
systems
operational.
To
see
you
standing
there
If
only
Lara
could
have
witnessed
this.
Who
are
you?
I
am
your
father,
Kal.
Or
at
least
a
shadow
of
him.
His
consciousness.
My
name
was
Jor-El.
And
Kal?
That's
my
name.
It
is.
I
have
so
many
questions.
Where
do
I
come
from?
Why
did
you
send
me
here?
You
came
from
Krypton.
A
world
with
a
much
harsher
environment
Long
ago...
...in
an
era
of
expansion...
...our
race
spread
out
through
the
stars...
...seeking
new
worlds
to
settle
upon.
This
scout
ship
was
We
built
outposts
on
other
planets...
musing
great
machines
to
reshape
For
100,000
years,
...accomplishing
wonders.
What
happened?
Artificial
population
control
The
outposts
on
space
exploration
We
exhausted
our
natural
resources.
As
a
result,
Eventually,
our
military
leader...
...General
Zod,
attempted
a
coup.
But
by
then
it
was
too
late.
Your
mother
and
I
foresaw
...and
we
took
certain
steps
This
is
a
genesis
chamber.
All
Kryptonians
were
conceived
Every
child
was
designed
to
fulfill
...as
a
worker...
...a
warrior,
a
leader
and
so
on.
Your
mother
and
I
believed
Krypton
The
element
of
choice,
of
chance.
What
if
a
child
dreamed
mother
than
what
society
What
if
a
child
aspired
You
were
the
embodiment
Krypton's
first
natural
birth
in
centuries.
That's
why
we
risked
so
much
to
save
you.
Why
didn't
you
come
with
me?
We
couldn't,
Kal.
No
matter
how
much...
...we
wanted
to.
No
matter
how
much
we
loved
you.
Your
mother,
Lara,
and
I...
...were
a
product
of
the
failures
...tied
to
its
fate.
-
So
I'm
alone.
You're
as
much
a
child
of
Earth
now
You
can
embody
the
best
of
both
worlds.
A
dream
your
mother
and
I
The
people
of
Earth
But,
ultimately,
They
won't
necessarily
Not
if
you
guide
them,
Kal.
Not
if
you
give
them
hope.
That's
what
this
symbol
means.
The
symbol
of
the
house
of
El
Embodied
within
that
hope
...in
the
potential
of
every
person
That's
what
you
can
bring
them.
CLARK:
JOR-EL:
Earth's
sun
is
younger
and
brighter
Your
cells
have
drunken
its
radiation...
â€œstrengthening
your
muscles,
Earth's
gravity
is
weaker,
You've
grown
stronger
here
The
only
way
to
know
how

...is
to
keep
testing
your
limits.
Unh!

Uh--
Oh.
Whoa!

JOR-EL:
You

They'll
race

you.
They
will
stumble.
They
will
fall.
But
in
time...
...they
will
join
you
in
the
sun,
Kal.
In
time...
you
will
help
them
accomplish
wonders.

LOIS:
How
do
you
find
someone
who
has
You
start
with
the
urban
legends...
...that
have
sprung
up
in
his
wake.
LOIS:
...who
have
seen
him.
LOIS:
For
some
he
was
a
guardian
angel.
...a
ghost
who
never
quite
fit
in.
MAN:
...coming
towards
the
oil
rig.
LOIS:
As
you
work
your
way
back
in
time,
I'm
looking
for
a
Pete
Ross.
Yeah,
he
works
at
the
IHOP.
LOIS:
I'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
an
accident
A
school
bus
that
went
into
the
river.

MARTHA:
LOIS:
I'm
Lois
Lane.
I'm
from
the
Daily
Planet.

Quiet.
I'm
from
the
Daily
Planet

I
figured
if
I
turned
over
enough
stones
Where
are
you
from?
Let
me
tell
your
story.
What
if
I
don't
want
my
story
told?
It's
going
to
come
out
eventually.
Somebody's
going
to
get
a
photograph
-
Then
I'll
disappear
again.
...is
to
stop
helping
people
altogether,
My
father
believed
that
if
the
world
...they'd
reject
me...
...out
of
fear.
CLARK:
I
just
wanna
do
something
useful
So
farming,
feeding
people.
CLARK:
JONATHAN:
Our
family's
been
farming
Your
family,
not
mine.
I
don't
even
know
why
I'm
listening
to
you.
You're
just
some
guy
Clark.
It's
all
right,
Martha.
He's
right.
Clark
has
a
point.
We're
not
your
parents.
But
we've
been
doing
the
best
we
can.
And
we've
been
making
this
up
Maybe
our
best
Look,
Dad--
Hold
on.



JONATHAN:
Go
for
the
overpass!
Take
cover!
Take
cover!
MAN:
Over
there.
Just
follow
them.
WOMAN:
Hank's
still
in
the

Hank's

I'll
get
him,
I'll
get
him.
Get
your
mom
to
the
overpass.

Hank!
Hank!
Come!
Jonathan!

-
Jonathan!

Dad!
CLARK:
Because
he
was
convinced
That
the
world
was
not
ready.
What
do
you
think?
LOMBARD:
Hey,
Perry's
gunning
for
you.
He
knows
you're
Woodburns
anonymous
Oh,
look
at

Ha,
ha,
ha.

I
told
you
not
to
run
with

going
haywire.
...is
pulling
our
missiles
down.
PERRY:
...we're
leaving.


PILOT
2:
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

COP:
Everybody,
come
on!
Jenny!
Oh,
my
God.
Perry!
LOMBARD:
Our
people
can
co-exist.
So
we
can
suffer
through
years
of
pain
-
You're
talking
about
genocide.
And
I'm
arguing
its
merits
with
a
ghost.
We're
both
ghosts,
Zod.
Can't
you
see
that?
Ship,
have
you
managed
to
quarantine
-
You'll
fail.
Then
prepare
to
terminate
it.
-
I'm
tired
of
this
debate.
...won't
change
anything.
My
son...
...is
twice
the
man
you
were.
And
he
will
finish
what
we
started.
I
can
promise
you
that.
Tell
me...
...you
have
Jor-El's
memories,
Can
you
experience...
...his
pain?
I
will
harvest
the
Codex
...and
I
will
rebuild
Krypton...
..atop
his
bones.
Argh!

PERRY:
-
Jenny.
Jenny,
where
are
you?
-
I'm
here.
Here.
Hold
on,
hold
on.
I'm
stuck.
-
I
can't
get
free.
I'm
stuck.
We'll
get
you
out
of
there,
all
right?
No,
no,
no!
-
Don't
leave
me.
-
Okay.
-
Get
your
ass
over
here
and
help
me.
PERRY:
We
just
gotta
move
this.
Slide
that
in.
You
push,
I'll
pull,
okay?
Go.

LOMBARD:
Push!
LOMBARD:

Northcom,
this
is
Guardian.
Negative,
Guardian.

Come
on!
Push!
Ahh!
Argh!

He
did
it.
Northcom,
this
is
Guardian.
We're
passing
through
phase
line
red.
SWANWICK:
Arm
the
package.
You
are
cleared
hot.
We're
lining
up
for
the
final
run.
It's
up
to
you
and
Hamilton
now.

You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
HARDY:
...ready
to
drop?
Negative,
Guardian.
There's
something
wrong.
What's
it
supposed
to
do?
-
It's
supposed
to
go
in
all
the
way.
'Se-pilot's
aircraft.
CO-PI
LOT:
We
are
lined
up
for
the
drop.
We've
had
a
setback.
Target
that
aircraft.

COMPUTER:
ZOD:
If
you
destroy
this
ship...
...you
destroy
Krypton!
Krypton
had
its
chance.
Argh!

MAN:
...over
there!
Miss
Lane!
Ah!

SOLDIER:

A
good
death...
...is
its
own
reward.

Ah!



LOIS:
SUPERMAN:
Are
they
gone?
I
think
so.
He
saved
us.
You
know,
they
say
it's
all
downhill
I'm
pretty
sure
that
only
counts

Look
at
this.
We
could
have
built
a
new
Krypton...
...in
this
squalor.
But
you
chose
the
humans
over
us.
I
exist...
...only
to
protect
Krypton.
That
is
the
sole
purpose
And
every
action
I
take...
...no
matter
how
violent...
...or
how
cruel...
...is
for
the
greater
good...
...of
my
people.
And
now...
...I
have
no
people.
My
soul...
...that
is
what
you
have
taken...
...from
me.
I'm
going
to
make
them
suffer,
Kal.
These
humans
you've
adopted,
...one
by
one.
...and
I'm
gonna
stop
you.
Argh!

Argh!
ZOD:
...one
way
this
ends,
Kal.
Either
you
die...
...or
I
do.
Unh!

I
was
bred
to
be
a
warrior,
Kal.
Trained
my
entire
life...
...to
master
my
senses.
Where
did
you
train?
On
a
farm?




Argh!


If
you
love...
...these
people
so
much...
...you
can
mourn
for
them.

Don't
do
this!
Stop!

Stop!
Never.



Ahh!

SWANWICK:
SUPERMAN:
SWANWICK:
SUPERMAN:
I
know
you're
trying
to
find
out
-
You
won't.
...the
obvious
question:
How
do
we
know
you
won't
one
day
I
grew
up
in
Kansas,
general.
I'm
about
as
American
as
it
gets.
Look...
...I'm
hereto
help...
...but
it
has
to
be
on
my
own
terms.
You
have
to
convince
Washington
of
that.
Even
if
I
were
willing
to
try,
I
don't
know,
general.
Guess
I'll
just
have
to
trust
you.
What
are
you
smiling
about?
Nothing,
sir.
I
just
think
he's
kind
of
hot.
-
Get
in
the
car,
captain.
MARTHA:
He
always
believed
And
that
when
the
day
came...
...your
shoulders
would
be
able
Yeah,
I
just
wish
he
could
have
He
saw
it,
Clark,
believe
me.
MARTHA:
What
are
you
going
to
do
-
Have
you
given
any
thought
to
that?
I
gotta
find
a
job
CLARK:
...when
I
want
to
go
somewhere
dangerous

Come
on,
Lois.
Courtside
seats
to
the
game
tonight.
-
What
do
you
say?
...you
should
go
back
You'll
probably
have
more
luck.
Sorry.
Courtside?
LOIS:
Don't.
Ha,
ha,
ha.
Lombard,
Lane,
I
want
you
to
show
him
the
ropes.
Good
luck,
kid.
LOMBARD:
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
LOIS:
Lois
Lane.
Welcome
to
the
Planet.
Glad
to
be
here,
Lois.
