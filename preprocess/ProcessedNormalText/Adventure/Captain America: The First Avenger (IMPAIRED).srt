Is
this

Yes.
I
don`t

me?
I

This
is
from
Augsburg.
My
city.
So
many
people
forget
that
the

the
Nazis
invaded
You
know,
after
the
last

They
felt
weak.
They
felt
small.
And
then
Hitler
comes
along
and
the
big
show
and
the

And
he
hears
of
me.
My
work.
And
he
says,
``You.``
He
says,
``You
will
make
us

Well,
I

For

it

that
there
is

power

here

Schmidt

Did
it
make
him
stronger?
Yes.
But
there
were
other
effects.
The

was
not
ready.
But
more
important,
the
man.
The
serum
amplifies
so
good
becomes
great.
Bad
becomes
worse.
This
is
why
you
were
chosen.
Because
a
strong
man
may
lose
respect
for
that
power,
but
a
weak
man
knows
And
knows
compassion.
Thanks.
I
think.
Whatever
happens
tomorrow,
That
you
will
stay
who
you
are.
Not
a
perfect
soldier,

a
good

No,
no.
Wait,
wait.

No,

All

No,

there

I
understand
you

him.
See
for
yourself.
You
disapprove.
I
just
don`t
see
I
can`t
imagine
he
will
succeed.
Again.
His

is
the

we

it
away
from

Not

Well,
asking
