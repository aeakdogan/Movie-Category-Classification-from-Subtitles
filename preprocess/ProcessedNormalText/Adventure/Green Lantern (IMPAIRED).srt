a

The

built

In

Together,
these

formed

Of
all
the
threats
the

ever
faced...

the
gravest
was
an
entity
of

you're

Yes,

that's

because
I
slept

I
used
to
sleep
in.
Then
I
turned

Let
me
give
you
a
little
heads-up.
I've
gone
up
against
these

There
isn't
anything
you
can
do
that
...and
without
disappointing

I,
uh,
think
we
both
know
that's
not
true.
This
is
exactly
why
I
didn't
want
you
I
would've
gone
with

I'd
have
too,
but
unfortunately
At

it's

not
to
be.
HAL:

You

of
a

You...
CARL:
It
does
matter.
Never
mind
that
you
crashed
You
broke
the
rules
of
engagement.
And
you
blew
the
contract
I'm
sorry.
I
thought
this
was
a
dogfight.
I
was
under
the
impression
No,
the
objective
was
to
show
And
in
combat,
I
did.
Now
you
know
you
gotta
boost
the
ceiling.
You
didn't
have
to
make
that
point
That's
enough,
Carol.
Since
I'm
gonna
have
to

late.
I
quit.
CAROL:

grounded,
Watch
your

That's
impossible,

Tell
me
what
happened.
Don't
give
me
that,

You
had

you

What's
with
the

-
I
know
your
dad's
been
bucking
for
you...
You're
a
pilot,
and
a
good
one.
I
like
it
and
I'm
good
at
it.
Doesn't
mean
I'll
never
get
in
a
cockpit
That's
the
way
a

looks
at
things,
At

I
just
don't

called

of

MICHAEL
:
-
Michael!
What
did
you
say?
I
didn't
say
anything.
Did
you
just
call
me
a
loser?
MICHAEL
:
"Freak"?!




Class
dismissed.

So
how
you
been?
Been
a
while.
So
you
had
a
rough
night
last
night.

You
need
to
get
some
sleep,
son.
-
Have
a
seat.
Well,
actually,
you've
already
done
it.
For
me
and
for
your
country.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I'm
talking
about
you
impressing
Where
did
you
get
that?
I'm
on
a
subcommittee
-
Top-secret,
of
course.
Because
of
this,
we're
gonna
be
able
...helping
to
oversee
the
operation.
There
are
scientists
-
Mm-hm.
And
less
connected.
Don't
be
naive,
son.
You
have
to
seize
an
opportunity
HAMMOND
:
Just
wasting
his
life
away.

What
an
embarrassment.
Bill!
Ha.
How
are
you?
I'm
terrific.
No,
no,
no.
Just
finishing
up
a
meeting.





SINESTRO:
With
my
own
eyes
I
saw
this
...and
then
feed
on
that
fear.
There's
more.
We've
tracked
its
trajectory.
Never
before
has
an
enemy
You
must
tell
me
what
you
know.
FIRST
GUARDIAN:
...against
the
forces
of
darkness
But
as
that
power
began
to
seem
...a
great
debate
arose
among
us.
Should
we
exploit
...one
we
had
long
since
sworn
Fear.
But
the
power
of
fear
The
chance
of
corruption
too
great.
And
so
we
decided
against
it.
All
of
us,
that
is,
except
one.
Alone,
this
Guardian
He
wanted
to
prove
the
light
of
fear
His
intentions
were
pure...
...
but
his
hopes
were
naive.
Consumed
by
the
yellow
power
of
fear...
...
the
Guardian
became
the
very
evil
He
became
Parallax.
For
the
universe's
safety
and
his
own...
...Abin
Sur
was
charged
with
But
he
escaped.
Feeding
on
the
fear
of
others,
And
is
now
headed
here...
...to
take
his
revenge
on
you
Then
we
have
no
choice.
We
must
prepare
to
harness
the
power
To
protect
our
sectors,
We
must
forge
a
yellow
ring.

I'm

TOM:
Hi.

SINGER
:
You
make
me
nervous
Rough
night,
huh?
Hector.
How
you
doing?
-
Same
old,
same
old.
Hal
Jordan.
Worst
pilot
I've
ever
seen.
I've
been
called
both.
-
Glad
you
could
make
it,
son.
No,
you're
family,
Hal.
There
are
thinkers
in
this
world
And
you
are
one
of
the
doers.
Yeah,
but
the
thinkers
Wouldn't
have
a
plane
Of
course.
Excuse
me,
I
need
a
drink.
-
I
gotta
get
back
to
work.
This
is
work.
-
Nice
to
see
you,
son.
Nice.

Yeah,
my
dad
used
to
train
in
it.
I
was
talking
about
your
dress.
Nice
jacket.
Last
time
I
checked,
Yeah,
I've
been
shaking
up
Congratulations
on
the
contract.
I
pointed
out
you
only
won
because
you
And
Tom
figured
out
So
I
guess
in
a
way,
...you
actually
did
us
a
favor.
Look...
...I'm
uncomfortable
SINGER

CARL:
Great
evening.
Somebody
very
special
I'd
like
to
thank
My
daughter,
Carol
Ferris.
Come
on!

Congratulations,
Carol.
I
take
one
look
at
you,
young

...or
at

Whoo!
A

Oh,
my

Hey!
-
Congratulations.
Um...
Here's
to
you
and
Hal,
the
future.
Yeah,
heh,
I'm
sorry.
I
know
it
couldn't
have
been
easy
But,
hey,
you're
doing
great,
so...
Ha,
ha.
I
am.
I'm
doing
great.
Ha,
ha.
-
He's
right,
though.
I'm
not
a
doer.
Although
I
did
get
to
examine
That
was
very
cool.
I
can't
tell
anyone
about
it,
Hector
telling
you
another
HAMMOND

Can't
keep
his

shut.
You
really

We

here.


Oh,

WOMAN
2:






What
happened
tonight
took
place
...
but
people
will
be
talking
about
it
A
helicopter
careening
out
of
control,
...
when
all
of
a
sudden,
a
mystery
man,
...
incredibly
diverting
the
helicopter
...
and
miraculously
rescuing
Carol
Ferris.
The
real
question
tonight
is
who
is
this




Start
talking.
-
A
racetrack?
TOM:
That's
the
best
you
could
come
up
with
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Did
I
disappoint
you?
I
materialized
a
track
out
of
pure
energy,
I'm
sorry
about
that.
No,
I
wanna
see
this
stuff.
Show
me.
I
don't
think
that's
a
good
idea.
Come
on,
I
wanna
see
this
stuff.
I
wanna
see
the
outfit,
the
flying...
Hal,
being
your
best
friend's
no
picnic.
-
It's
for
emergencies!
Hal,
I
wanna
see
it.
Fine.
Hold
on
to
your
glasses.

HAL:
Question:
-
You
ready
to
have
your
mind
blown?
Ring.
Finger.

Here
we
go.

-
Did
you
break
it
already?
It's
out
of
juice.
I
have
to
recharge
it.
Now
pay
attention.
Aah!
Green!
-
Wow.

Whoo!

Not
bad,
huh?
You're
a
superhero.

Don't
they
always
get
the
girl?
Evening,
ma'am.
Didn't
get
a
chance
to
say
goodbye.
Are
you
okay?
Uh,
yeah,
no,
Just
doing
my
job.
No,
it
is.
You
saved
my
life.
You
saved
all
of
our
lives.
Hal?
Miss?
Hal?!
Oh,
my
Go...
Oh,
my
God!
-
Oh,
my
God!
Hal!
What?
I've
known
you
my
whole
life!
You
don't
think
I
would
recognize
you
What
is
this?!
Why
is
your
skin
green?
What
the
hell
is
with
that
mask?!
It
came
with
the
outfit.
Cool,
huh?
CAROL:
So
it
all
works
HAL:
Intergalactic
green
peacekeepers,
CAROL:
Ha,
ha.
I'm
not
making
it
up.

CAROL:
I
mean,
when
we
were
kids,
-
I
did,
actually.
I
called
this
early
on.
I
said,
"One
day
I'll
be
a
green
space
cop."
Okay,
so
at
the
party,
how
did
you
Anything
I
see
in
my
mind,
I
can
create.
Anything?
Anything.

Happy
birthday.
Better
late
than
never.
Um...
Okay,
so
how
does
it
work?
They
just,
um,
call
you
on
your
cell,
No.
I
don't
think
it
works
Well,
technically
speaking,
um...
...I
actually
sort
of,
uh...
...quit.
What
do
you
mean?
How?
Well,
I
mean,
it's
a
lot
like
quitting
I
don't
understand.
How
do
you
walk
away
Is
that
even
possible?
Oh,
I
think
we
both
know
If
for
once
you
didn't
quit
something
...what's
the
worst
that
could
happen?
Well,
thank
you.
-
I
know
I've
made
a
lot
of
mistakes...
I
feel
bad
for
you,
really.
You've
been
given
so
much
so
often.
And
you
just...
Good
night.



WALLER:
There
is
something
I'd
like
to
show
you.
Something
I'm
fairly
certain
SON:
DAUGHTER:
I
love
you.

WALLER:

Physical
contact
I
can
see
your
memories.


Dad.
Son,
this
is
my
fault.
But
I'm
gonna
fix
it.
We're
gonna
get
you
well
again.
I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
We
detected
traces
...buried
within
the
body
of
the
first.
You've
been
exposed.
I've
never
felt
better
in
my
life.
We
know
everything,
son.
I've
never
felt
better
in
my
life.

TOMAR-RE:
To
be
chosen
to
join
its
ranks
...
and
the
greatest
of
responsibilities.
The
ring
never
makes
a
mistake.


HAMMOND:
They
just
need
to
run
some
tests,
Keep
him
under.
I
only
want
what's
best
for
you.

Run.







-
Hector.
Don't
worry.
I
only
want
what's
best
for
you.










The
ring,
it
chose
you.
Take
it!
HECTOR:
Hi.

The
alien
was
one
of
you.
How
did
we
end
up
so
different?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Sit
down!

Now...
...how's
Carol?
-
That
came
out
wrong.
HAL:
I've
made
mistakes...
I
feel
bad
for
you,
really.
Good
night.

You're
just
as
much
of
a
failure
And
just
as
afraid.
Well...
...I
used
to
fight
my
fear.
But
now
that
I've
tasted
its
true
power...
...I'll
never
go
back.


HAL:


You
wear
the
ring
of
the
Lantern
You
will
suffer
the
same
fate.
Once
I
have
devoured
your
world...
...
I
will
have
all
the
strength
I
need...
...to
defeat
the
Corps


TOM:
This
thing
that's
out
there
attacking
planets
Somehow
it
infected
him
-
Well,
you're
just
gonna
have
to
stop
it.
Well,
I
tried
that
and
I
failed.
And
the
senator
died.
Wait,
go
back.
The
one
thing
that
a
Green
Lantern
Fearless
is
the
job
description.
That
isn't
me.
So
you're
just
gonna
walk
away
again?
Explain
this
to
me,
Hal.
Because
I'm
afraid!
You
don't
think
your
dad
ever
felt
afraid?
If
he
did,
Yeah,
well,
there's
a
word
for
that:
Courage.
They
said
that
the
ring
wouldn't
have
Something
I
don't
see.
Yet.
I
see
it.
I
always
have.
The
ring
didn't
see
It
saw
that
you
had
the
ability
to
It
saw
that
you're
courageous.
Which
you
are.
Just
like
your
dad.

PARALLAX:
Eliminate
him.
SINESTRO:
Once
I've
mastered
its
power...
...I'll
begin
training
the
Corps
Though
Earth
will
be
lost...
...we'll
be
ready
to
make
a
stand
against
Then
the
power
of
the
enemy
HAL:
SINESTRO:
You
dare
enter
this
chamber?
You
gotta
help
me
save
my
world.
I
know
that
humans
aren't
the
strongest
We're
young,
we
have
a
lot
to
learn.
But
we're
worth
saving.
This
new
weapon
of
yours,
Once
you
cross
that
line,
once
you've
given
Look,
I
know
right
now
you're
afraid.
You
dare
accuse
the
Guardians
Yes,
I
do.
That's
exactly
why
Parallax
...because
you're
afraid
I
know.
I
spent
my
entire
life
doing
it.
You
know,
we
have
a
saying
on
Earth.
We
say,
"I'm
only
human."
We
say
it
because
we're
vulnerable,
It
doesn't
mean
we're
weak.
Help
me
save
my
planet.
Don't
give
in
to
fear.
Fight
it.
Fight
it
with
me.
GUARDIAN:
But
as
immortals,
we
must
measure
...and
the
fate
of
the
universe.
We
simply
cannot
risk
losing
everything
Then
don't.
Don't
risk
any
more
lives.
Just
mine.
Let
me
go
fight
for
my
world...
...and
I'll
show
you
There
is
no
way
you
can
succeed.
You
will
die,
Hal
Jordan.
Then
I'll
die
trying.
Good
luck,
Green
Lantern.

I
wouldn't
do
that.
Look
closely.
She's
beautiful,
isn't
she?
I
loved
her
from
the
moment
But
she
could
never
see
me,
But
not
anymore.
No!
No!
Don't!
Don't
do
this,
Hector.
Please.
Please.
I
know
how
you
feel.

Come
on,
look
at
yourself!
No,
I
know
what
it's
like...
...to
not
live
up
to
expectations...
...to
feel
like
nothing
that
you
do
I
know
what
it's
like
to
be
afraid.
Let
me
help
you.
Hal.
You've
changed.
How
wonderful
that
all
it
took
for
you
Now
it's
my
turn.
And
if
I
can't
be
like
you,
And
let's
face
it,
once
she's
like
me...
...then
you
wouldn't
be
very
interested.
Hmm?
Now,
would
you?
-
Why
can't
you?
Why
can't
you
be
like
me?
Heh.
Huh?
Let
her
go...
...and
you
can
have
it.
You
can
do
anything.
Be
anything.
Take
it.
Let
her
make
the
choice.
Okay.

Wow.

Now
bring
her
down.

Hal.
I
lied.
I
lied
too.
See,
the
way
it
works
is...
...you
have
to
be
chosen.






You
have
failed
me.

Stay
here.
No
problem.


Your
will
is
strong,
You
are
nothing
without
the
ring.


POLICEMAN
:
Please
clear
the
streets.
Clear
the
streets
immediately.
You
can
never
beat
this.
You'll
die.
At
least
I
can
get
it
away
from
here.
-
How
do
you
think
you're
gonna
do
that?

Maybe
I
can
outthink
it
or...
The
dogfight,
remember?
Those
were
a
couple
of
jets.
Unbeatable
jets.
The
ring
chose
me
for
a
reason.
This
is
why.
-
Look,
I'm
probably
not...
Hey.

POLICEMAN
:
Everyone
must
clear
the
streets
Police
emergency,


DRIVER:
Go!
Go!
MAN:




-
Run!



I
feel
your
fear
growing.
You
will
be
dead
soon.
In
brightest
day,
in
blackest
night...
And
when
you're
gone,
-
No
evil
shall
escape
my
sight.
Your
family,
your
home,
Let
those
who
worship
evil's
might...
The
entire
human
race
will
be
wiped
out
...were
afraid.
-
Beware
my
power:
Green
Lantern's
light!

The
bigger
you
are,
the
faster
you
burn.


SINESTRO:
Though
his
time
...Hal
Jordan's
defeat
of
Parallax
will
be
His
actions
are
a
reminder
To
overcome
fear...
...and
destroy
evil
wherever
it
may
hide.
As
Lanterns,
Our
wills
haven't
always
been
united.
It's
time
they
were.

-
Ha-ha-ha.
SINESTRO:
You're
rash,
volatile,
opinionated.
It
seems
Abin
Sur
found
another

Wow,
I
am
never
getting
used
to
that.
My
new
job
requires
that
I
travel.

Be
away
for
a
while.
Away,
never
gone.
Hal.
Yeah?
Can
you
take
off
the
mask?
That's
really
cool.
Ha,
ha.

So,
what
happens
now?
I'm
gonna
go
look
for
trouble.

TOMAR-RE:
Of
all
the

there
was

proved
