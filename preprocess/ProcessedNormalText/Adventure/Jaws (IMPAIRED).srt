Matt's
from
Nice
to
meet
you.
Terrific,
huh,
Mayor,
huh?
Martin,
there
are
Hammerheads,
white
tips,
And
the
chances
that
these
There
are
no
other
It's
100-to-1.
Now
I'm
not
saying
It
probably
is,
Martin.
It's
a
man-eater.
It's
extremely
rare
But
the
fact
is,
is
different
than
I
just...
I
wanna
be
sure.
We
all
wanna
What
I
wanna
do
The
digestive
system
of
this
Let's
cut
it
open.
Whatever
it's
eaten
is
bound
to
And
then
we'll
be
sure.
It
may
be
the
only
way
Look,
fellows,
This
is
not
to
perform
some
kind
of
a
half-assed
autopsy
And
I
am
not
and
see
that
thing
cut
open
and
see
that

out
all
over

I
just
found
out
that
a

And
you
knew
it.
You
knew
there
was

You
knew
it
was
dangerous.
But
you
let
people
You
knew
all
those
things,
but
still
my
boy
is
dead
now.
And
there's
nothing
My
boy
is
dead.
I
wanted
you
to
know
that.
I'm
sorry,
Martin.
No,
she's
not.

let's
cut
this
ugly
before
it
stinks
up
Harve,
you
and
Carl
and
dump
it
in
the
drink.
Come
here.
Give
us
a
kiss.
Why?
Because
I
need
it.


Get
out
of
here.


Uh,
I'm
Matt
Hooper.
Oh,
Hi.
Ellen
Brody.
Your
husband's
home?
Yes.
I'd
really,
uh,
like
Uh,
yes,
so
would
I.
Come
in.
Come
in.
No,
no.
No,
no,
no.
Oh,
wine.
How
nice.
How
was
your
day?

Swell.
I
got,
uh,
I
didn't
know
Oh,
that's
nice.
Is
anyone
eating
this?
No.
My
husband
tells
me

Excuse
me.
l-I've
never
heard
it
But
yes,
I
am.
I
love
sharks.
You
love
sharks?
Yeah,
I
love
them.
When
I
was
12
years
old,
this
boat
and
I
went
fishing
I
hooked
a
scup
and
I
hooked
a
4.5
foot
who
proceeded
He
ate
my
oar,
hooks,
He
turned
an
inboard
scared
me
to
death,
When
I
was
on
the
beach,
and
I
actually
saw
my
boat
Ever
since
then,
yes,
and
that's
why
I
know
to
the
Institute
tomorrow
and
tell
them
a
shark
problem
here.
Why
do
you
have
I'm
sorry,
You
told
me
l...
I
heard
it
I
heard
it
on
They
caught
a
shark,
Not
the
shark
that
And
probably
not
the
shark
Which
I
wanted
to
prove
today
You
may
want
to
let
Nothing,
nothing.

Yeah,
yeah.
You
know,
uh,
you're
gonna
left
on
this
island
Where
are
you
going?
I
am
going
on
the
Aurora.

The
Aurora?

What
is
that?
It's
a
floating
asylum
It's
pure
research,
Martin
hates
boats.
Martin
sits
in
his
car
when
we
go
on
I
guess
it's
There's
a
clinical
name
Drowning.
Listen,
is
it
true
that
by
sharks
in
three
feet
about
10
feet
Yeah.
And
that...
And
that
before
for
recreation...
l...
I
mean,
before
sharks
that
a
lot
of
these
That's
right.
Now
this
shark
what's
it
called?
Rogue,
yeah.
Now,
this
guy,
he,
in
a
place
where
until
the
food
supply
That's
called
It's
just
a
theory
Then
why
don't
we
and
go
down
and
Martin?
Can
you
do
that?
I
can
do
anything.

We
start
in
and
open
the
digestive
tract.




Just
like
I
thought.
What?
Came
up
in
the
Gulf
Stream,
He
didn't
eat
a
car,
did
he?
No.
Tiger
shark's
It'll
eat
anything.
Somebody
probably


That's
it.
I've
got
to
close
the
beach,

You
got
a
bigger
You
still
got
a
hell
with
a
mouth
about
this
big.
How
do
we
confirm
that
If
he
is
a
rogue,
and
there's
any
