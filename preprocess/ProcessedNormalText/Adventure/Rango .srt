Alone

Dr
Marx?
Dr
Marx,
People,
we've
talked
about
this.
Victor,
you
were
wooden!
Mr
Timms?
You
were
good.
Perhaps
a
little
too
good.
What's
that,
Victor?

Who

I?
I

arm!
Or

Down,
Chongo,

And

you
You

me
But
you

remarkably
at
ease.
Stop
it.
No,

Well,

you
must.
What
are
you
doing?
That
tickles.
Are
those
real?
That's
it!
Conflict.
Victor,
you
were
right.
People,
l've
had
an
epiphany.
What
our
story
needs
is
an
ironic,
that
will
propel
the
hero
into
conflict!
Mr
Timms?
That's
right!
You!
Don't
be
shy.
Come
on.

help
here.
Are
you
okay?

get
to
the
other
side.
The
other
side?
You

just
now,
That's
why
the...
Why'd
you
do
that?
This
is
my
quest.
He
waits
for
me.
What?
Who?
The
Spirit
of
the
West,
amigo.
The
one.
They
say
he
rides
an
alabaster
carriage
What
are
you
talking
about?
Enlightenment.
Nothing?
Your
delusional
quest

had
an
incredibly
complex
Highly
sophisticated
friends!
Friends?

You

very
lonely
lizard.

Not

going
there.

here.
That
may
be
true,
but
here
you
are.
Now

me
up

You
will?
Quickly.

to
my
quest.

before?
Come,

my
finger.
The
Spirit
is
waiting
for
me.
Okay,

Okay.
That's

to
the
other
side.
Why
don't
you
just
wait
lt's
not
so
easy
as
it
looks.
What?
ls
a
metaphor.
There's
another
one!

You

little
help,

Exactly
how
you

that,
Mr
Rango?
You
know,
l'm
glad
you
asked
me
that.
And
l
will
be
happy
to

you
how.
Because

it
with
my

Water
in

No.
Well,
we
can
all

Why
do

so
many
people
Well,
what

supposed
to
do?
Well,
l

he's

out
The
Mayor?
He
may
be
our
only
hope.
Bullet
hits
a
shovel,
ricochets
back
and
that's
when
the
roof
caved
in,
igniting
the
thermos
instantly
vapourising
his
bodily
form,
and
a
high-pitched
squeal.
Hold
on,
there.
That's
only
six.
Number
seven?
Hell,
he
died
of
infection.
-
Seven
men!
Drinks
all
around!
Dance
for
me,
Sod
Buster!
-
Yes,

like
a
chicken!
You

corn
in
your

You

That's

friend.
lf

in
this
town
again,

gonna
slice
it
off
and

Mind

beak.
And
don't
come
back!
What
are
you
all
gawping
at?
Hey,
Bad
Bill,
What
is
this?
You
know
who
that

Bill?
Yeah,
he

going
to

you

And
if

Now
that's
what

talking
about.
Yeah.
All
right,
now
listen
up!
Things
are
going
to
be

Got

my
coffee
hot,
Danish
on
the
side.
Whatever
you
do,
Stay
out
of
my
peripheral
vision!
-
lt's
Rango.
He
ain't
afraid
of
nobody.
And
when
you
see
me
coming,
l
take
large
steps
and
l
don't
want
getting
your
bodily
fluids
on
my
boots!
Of
course,
there
is
no
need
for
violence,
as
long
as
we
stick
together,
So
l
want
you
all
to
come
outside
now
while
l
take
a
brief
intermission!
What's
he
doing
now?
l
think
it's
a
number
two.
Never
mind.
Take
a
look-see
over
here!
Well,
look
at
him
now!
He's
chasing
after
that
hawk!
Give
him
hell,
Rango!
-
Did
you
see
that?
What
do
you
think,
Doc?
This
hawk
is
dead!
Shoot,
l
say
we
cook
that
right
up.
He
did
it
with
one
bullet!
Just
like
he
said!
lt's
about
time
One
who
ain't
in
a
pine
box.
l
think
it's
time
he
met
the
Mayor.
You
hear
that,
Rango?
Let's
hear
it
for
Rango!
And
so
the
stranger
basks
in
the
adulation
of
his
new
friends,
sinking
deeper
into
the
guacamole
When
is
he
going
to
die?
Soon,
compadre.
Soon.
My
land
is
not
for
sale!
l
came
here
to
save
my
land,
not
sell
it!
l'm
sure
there's
something
reasonable
Beans!
Where
are
you
going?
Beans?
The
Mayor
will
see
you
now.
Water,
Mr
Rango,
water.
Without
it,
But
with
water
there's
life.
Look
at
them,
so
desperate
to
live,
That's
the
immutable
law
of
the
desert.
Control
the
water
But
l
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
being
Oh,
yeah.
The
West
is
the
best.
This

private
stock.

Not

has
its
privileges.
You
make
a
good
point,
son.
But
with
privilege
comes
responsibility.
Hell,
l
was
mayor
here
And
l
may
be
but
l
think
there's
a
future
for
this
town.
-
To
Dirt!
You
see
them,
Mr
Rango?
lt's
a
hard
life
here.
Very
hard.
Do
you
know
how
they
make
it
through
They
believe.
They
believe
it's
going
to
be
better.
They
believe
that
the
water
will
come.
They
believe
against
all
odds
that
tomorrow
will
be
better
than
today.
People
have
to
believe
in
something.
Right
now,
they
believe
in
you.
Pick
it
up,
Mr
Rango.
People
have
to
believe
in
something.
lt's
almost
noon.
ls
everything
ready?
Yeah.
But
he
might
be
a
problem.
He's
not
a
problem,
William.
lt
just
don't
make
no
sense.
This
whole
town
is
drying
up,
and
the
Mayor
is
the
only
one
Doesn't
that
make
you
And
what
about
that
water
All
right!
No
need
to
incite
anxiety.
But
if
you
really
feel
l
suggest
you
take
it
up
This
is
going
to
be
good.
Hey!
Not
too
tight.
That's
good.
Oh,
easy
there,
tiger.
-
A
little
up
and
back?
Have
you
got
French
cuffs
with
that?
Excuse
me,
Sheriff
Rango.
Hey,

does
seem
a
bit
naïve,
taking
the
word
Besides,
once
they
hang,
-
Bravo!
But
what
if
somebody
did
rob
the
bank
And
who
would
do
that,
Mr
Rango?
l
was
hoping
you
could
tell
me.
That
sounds
marginally
Take
it
any
way
you
like.
Something
you
said
keeps
rattling
What's
that?
"Control
the
water
Come
now,
Mr
Rango.
You
attribute
divine
power
to
me.
How

You've
obviously
mastered

game.
Well,

here
before
the
highway
split
l
watched
the
march
of
progress,
and
l
learned
a
thing
or
two.
Perhaps
it's
time
you
started

to
appreciate
Look
out
there,
son.
You
can
almost
see
time
passing.
What
are
you
building
out
here?
The
future,
Mr
Rango,
the
future.
One
day
soon,
the
frontier
town,
the
lawman,
There's
just
no
place
-
We're
civilised
now.
That's
what
the
future
holds.
You
can
either
be
part
of
it,

Mr
Rango.

The
Mayor

for
your
ranch,
Miss
Beans.
That
just
don't
make
no
sense.
Unless
he
controls
the
water.
Like
a
monkey's
bladder!
Then
he
could
bring
it
back
But
how
does
he
control
the
water?
Well,
you
gotta
spend
some
time
'Cause

You

just,
we
got
no
hope
We
got
nothing
left

You
see
that
sign
up
there?
As
long
as
that
sign
says
"Sheriff,"
you
can
believe
that
there's
But
without
law
and
order,
Starts
out
slow,
like
a

Somebody

a
cross
word.

on
neighbour.
And
then
dogs
and
cats
to
create
all
sorts
of
unnatural
So,
you

something
Believe
in
me.
Believe
in
that

sign.
For
as
long
as
it
hangs
there,
Hello,
brother.
Thirsty?
Long
time,
brother.
Well,

So
why

show
your
friends
here
Show
them
who
you
really
are.
Why
don't
you
just
pull
your
gun
But,
of
course,
you
won't
need
all
these.
Just
one,
right?
Go
ahead,
hero.
Pull
the
trigger.
You

killer
in
your
eyes,
son?

of
them
things
You

Jenkins
brothers.
Are

Say

Speak

No.
All

You
ain't
nothing
but
a
fake
Yes.

Louder!
Listen

pathetic
fraud.
This
is
my
town
now.

Who

you?
Who

I?
I'm
nobody.

Spirit
of
the
West.
Excuse

There's

beaut.
Sometimes

Yeah.
No

Searching,
same
as
you.

They
used
to
call
you
These
days

a
name
Doesn't

what
they
call
you.
Yeah,
but
my
deeds

Then

That's
right.
You
came
a
long
way
Don't

lt's
not
about
you.

about
them.
But

go
back.
Don't
know
that
you
got
a
choice,
son.
No
man
can
walk
out
on
his
own
story.
So
you
made
it.
That's
right,
amigo.
Did
you
just
see
that?
We
each
see
what
we
need
to
see.
Beautiful,
isn't
it?
Yeah.
lt
is.
Come,
my
friend.
Many
years
ago,
Now
only
one
question
remains.
Where
did
it
go?
They
follow
the
water.
They
follow
the
water!
Come
on!
That
just
don't
make
no
sense.
What
are

The
future,
Mr
Rango.

story.

Your
pappy
and

But

got
a
plan.

how
difficult
But
you're
making
a
practical
decision.
Decisions,
decisions.
There's
no
need
for
any
more
suffering.
Your
family's
ranch

All

Rango.
Aren't

gun,
Sheriff.
Now,
Mr
Rango.

new
West,
Jake.
There's
no
room
for
gunslingers
Yeah,
we

new
hats.
Where

come
from,
You
came
back.
What
was
that?
No
need
to
panic,
What?
Okay,
panic
time.
You
and
the
Sheriff
are
more
alike
You're
nothing
but
legends.
Pretty
soon,
One
last
bullet
to
kill
one
last
outlaw.
How
fitting.
Sheriff,
l'm
sure
if
we
work
together,
we
can
reach
a
mutually
beneficial
You
better
take
it
up
with
him.
One
bullet.
l
tip
my
hat
to
you,
one
legend
to
another.
What
was
that
you
said?
"Pretty
soon,
No,
Jake!
No!
Rango!
You
brought
the
water
back,
You
really
are
a
hero.
Well,
the
thing
about
heroes
is,
Don't
spoil
it.
Right.
Well,
l
don't
know
about
you
all,
And
so
the
lizard
completes
his
journey
from
humble
beginnings
And
although
he
is
certain
to
die,
which
account
the
people
of
the
village
even
as
they
abandon
their
dignity.
-
l'm
going
in.
Water
ain't
money.
Money
is
money.
-
Well,
l
ain't
got
no...
We
have
a
problem.
Who
let
Snuggles
in
the
pool
again?
l
really
think
you
complete
me.
Prithee,
unhand
my
fair
maiden.
-
Cut.
Cut.
Everybody,
take
five.
What's
my
motivation?
Oh,
you
kids.
What
did
you
do
that
for?
l
was
just
checking.
you
can
peel
a
man's
face
right
off.
-
What
is
it?
Don't
touch
it.
That's
the
second
time
This
water
thing's
great.
l'm
urinating
right
now.
Adult
swim,
next
five
minutes.
Stay
between
the
buoys.

your
lunch.
Danish

in
there

picked
the
raisins

Don't

nasal
spray
is

Now,
Beans!
We've
talked
about
this.
That's
for
my
gun.
That's
gun
lotion.
Sheriff,
where
are
you
headed?
There's
trouble
down
a
dry
creek.
Now,
honey,
you
come
back
And
don't
go
trying
to
be
a
hero.
Beans,
you
are
missing
the
point.
l
got
an
image
to
protect
now.
Where's
my
Tic
Tacs?
-
l
found
them.
Well,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
needs
the
hero
must
abandon
the
self
and
solidify
his
image
as
an
icon
So,
this
is
the
sunset
shot.
Give
them
a
good
one,
amigo.
Ready,
Excelsior?
My
fellow
comrades.
There
will
be
times
When
you
feel
pummelled
remember
this
moment.
Know
that
l
will
be
there
watching
you,
sometimes
at
inappropriate
moments.
That's
part
of
the
deal.
And
remember,
within
all
of
us
resides
the
true
Spirit
of
the...
Let's
take
it
from
the
top.
