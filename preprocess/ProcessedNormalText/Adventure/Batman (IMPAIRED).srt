MAYOR:
Across
this
nation...
...the
words
"Gotham
City"
Our
streets
are
overrun,
As
mayor,
I
promise
to
root
out

our
new

carry
out
that
promise.

They'd
be

Pretty
tough
talk
about
Carl.
Forget
about
it.
If
this
clown
could
touch
Grissom,
If
Grissom
knew
about
us...
...he
might
hand
you
something.
Don't
flatter
yourself,
angel.
He's
a
tired
old
man.
And
besides...
...he
doesn't
know.
You
don't
worry
about
anything,
You
look
fine.
I
didn't
ask.
MAN:
Yeah.

on.


ECKHARDT:
Let
me
guess.
Giant,
menacing,
supernatural
form.

That's
it.

It's

KNOX:
Lieutenant,
I
hear
we
had
That's
eight
sightings
in
a
month.
Sorry,
Knox.
GOON:
I'm
telling
you,
a
giant
bat!
Don't
write
about
this.
It
will
ruin
Lieutenant,
every
punk
They
say
he
can't
be
killed.
They
say
he
drinks
blood.
I
say
you're
full
of
shit,
Knox.
You
can
quote
me
on
that.
KNOX:
Is
there
a
six-foot
bat
Is
he
on
the
police
payroll?
What's
he
pulling
down,
after
taxes?



JACK:
Brought
you
a
little
snack,
Eckhardt.
ECKHARDT:
Why
don't
you
broadcast
it?
Harvey
Dent
has
been
sniffing
ECKHARDT:
That's
my
territory.
Your
problems
are
our
problems.
I
answer
to
Grissom,
not
to
psychos.
You
ought
to
think
about
the
future.
You
mean
when
you
run
the
show?
ECKHARDT:
You're
an
A-1
nut-boy,

Better
be
sure.
See?
You
can
make
a
good
decision

Where've
you
been
spending
your
nights?

MAYOR:
I
don't
care
if
this

I
want

HARVEY:
We
may
celebrate
It's

in
debt
MAYOR:
You
fill
the
square
with
people,
A
lot
of
people
may
stay
away.
They
won't
be
scared

you
making
out?
Mr.

I
love
that

We
were
discussing

does
it
to
