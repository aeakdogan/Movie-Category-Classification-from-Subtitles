Mom!
Mom!
Help
me.
What
is
it?
I
wasn't
dreaming,
Walt.
I
heard
him.
I
heard
him.
I
heard
him.
-
I
heard
him!
No.
I
wasn't
imagining
it,
Walt.
No,
I
did.
He's...
He's...
-
I
heard
him!
That's
about
as
far
as
I
can
get
you.
All
right.
Thank
you.
-
You
left
all
your
shit
on
my
dash.
Suit
yourself.
Thanks
again.
Hey,
hold
on
a
minute.
Here,
take
these.
If
you
make
it
out
alive,
give
me
a
call.
Thanks.
Hello?
Is
there
anybody
here?
Guess
not!
Two
years
he
walks
the
earth.
No
phone,
no
pool,
no
pets,
no
cigarettes.
Ultimate
freedom.
An
extremist.
An
aesthetic
voyager
whose
home
is
the
road.
"Hey,
listen,
old
man.
"Shut
up.
"Where
you
going?"
"I
told
you.
We're
going
nowhere!"
So
now,
after
two
rambling
years
The
climactic
battle
to
kill
the
false
being
within
and
victoriously
conclude
No
longer
to
be
poisoned
and
walks
alone
lost
in
the
wild.
...

and

I
see
them
standing
at
the
formal
gates
I
see
my
father
strolling
out
the
red
tiles
glinting
like
bent
plates
I
see
my
mother
standing
at
the
pillar
made
of
tiny
still
open
behind
her,
They
are
about
to
graduate.
They
are
about
to
get
married.
All
they
know
is
they
are
innocent,
I
want
to
go
up
to
them
and
say,
"She's
the
wrong

"You

"You

I
want
to
go
up
to
them
there
But
I
don't
do
it.
I
want
to
live.
I
take
them
up
like

the

Okay?
Who
wrote

Well,
could
have
been
either

of
us,
Why
is
he
letting
Carine
drive
his
car?
There's
a
lot
of
great
poems
in
here.
I
have
to
speak
to
her
about
it.
Sit
down.
Excuse
me.
I'm
going
to
get
my
son.
He
just
graduated
today
I'll
get
it.
I'll
get
it.
Chris,
hi!
You
scared
me
half
to
death
-
Hi,
Dad.
-
This
is
a
big
step.
All
right.
You're
not
supposed
to
be
driving
Why?
I
have
my
permit.
'Cause
it's
against
the
law
to
drive
in
another
state
I
didn't
know
that.
I
thought
that
if
I
was
Well,
let's...
-
Are
they
going
to
continue?
I
guess
everybody's
celebrating
today.
-
They're
going
to
stay
in
the
bar,
right?
My
grades
are
good
enough,
I
think,
Chris,
that's
wonderful.
That
is
a
big
deal.
How
much
do
you
have
left
Exactly
$24,500.68.
Well,
that's
specific.
I
had
to
go
to
the
bank
Your
mother
and
I
will
be
glad
That's
right.
I've
got
to
figure
out
I've
got
a
lot
of
things
Your
father
and
I,
We
want
to
get
you
out
of
that
junker.
What
junker?
That.
-
We
want
to
buy
you
a
new
car.
A
new
car?
Why
would
I
want
a
new
car?
Datsun
runs
great.
Do
you
think
I
want
some
fancy
boat?
Are
you
worried
Well,
we
weren't
gonna
get
you
We
just
want
to
get
you
a
nice
new
car
And
you
never
know
when
that
thing
Blow
up.
Blow
up?
I
don't
need
a
new
car.
-
I
don't
want
anything.
-
These
things,
things,
things,
things.
-
Everything
has
to
be
difficult.
-
Thank
you.
Maybe
he
just
wants
his
old
car.
Thank
you.
I
just
don't
want
anything.
Chris
measured
himself
by
a
fiercely
rigorous
moral
code.
Bye,
Chris!
He
risked
what
could
have
been
but
found
company
from
writers
like
Tolstoy,
He
could
summon
their
words
and
he
often
would.
I
forgot
to
ask
what
quote
he'd
have
but
I
had
a
good
idea
It
was
inevitable
And
when
he
did,
he
would
do
it
"It
should
not
be
denied
that
being
"It
is
associated
in
our
minds
"from
history
and
oppression
and

"Absolute
freedom.
"And
the
road
has
always
led
west."

Toward
the

And
on
it
went.
Clever
boy,
my
brother.
But
by
the
end
of
July,
and
my
parents
Chris
had
never
had
a
phone,
so
they
decided
to
drive
down
When
they
arrived
at
the
apartment,
and
the
manager
said
that
Chris
Oh,
yes.
He
left
two
months
ago.
So
when
they
got
home,
I
had
to
hand
them
all
the
letters
that
which
had
been
returned
in
a
bundle.
Chris
had
arranged
for
the
post
office
to
buy
himself
some
time.
Did
you
know
about
this?
He
didn't
say
anything.
I
understood
what
he
was
doing.

the
absurd
and
tedious

now
he
was

that
cut
Chris
off
Hey!
-
Hey,
man.
Step
around.
Jump
in.
We
barely
saw
you
there
This
door's
a
little
tricky.
That's
Rainey.
-
Hi,
Rainey.
-
I'm
Jan.
Alex
with
the
hat
on.
-
Yeah,
I
know.
You
said
it,
man.
So
you're
a
leather
now.
I'm
a
leather?
Yeah,
a
leather
tramp.
That's
what
they
Technically
we're
rubber
tramps.
Because
we
have
a
vehicle.
-
You
don't
have
to
push
me
away.
Yeah,
Alex
could
have
a
vehicle
as
well,
And
why
did
you
do
that?
I
don't
need
money.
Come
on,
Alex.
I
mean,
that
book
of
yours
is
cool
but
you
can't
depend
entirely
I
don't
know
if
you
want
to
depend
on
Where
are
your
mom
and
dad?
Living
their
lies
somewhere.
You
look
like
a
loved
kid.
Be
fair.
Fair?
You
know
what
I
mean.
I'll
paraphrase
Thoreau
here.
"Rather
than
love,
than
money,
"than
fame,
than
fairness,
"give
me
truth."
From
as
long
ago
there
have
been
Violence
that
we
were
forced
But
it
was
also
like
theater.
They
cast
us
as
both
judges
And
I
got
you
this
token,
Dad
had
been
the
young
genius
that
NASA
enlisted
to
do
crucial
designs
that
would
be
our
answer
And
Mom
and
he
later
started
up
combining
her
with
his
wealth
of
knowledge.
Look
at
this.
But
by
the
time
the
company
the
careerism
and
money
seemed
Thank
you
very,
very
much.
I
remember
the
first
family
meeting
to
let
us
in
on
their
plans
They
wanted
us
to
choose
We
cried
our
eyes
out.
The
divorce
never
happened,
but
the
battles
and
the
meetings
It
wasn't
very
long
We'd
say
"Go
ahead.
"Get
the
divorce."
Jeez.
If
I
struck
a
match
to
you
I'd
have
Where's
Jan
going?
Well,
my
friend,
all
is
not
well
on
the
hippie
front.
You're
an
industrious
little
fucker,
Little
bit.
It's
funny
how
things
happen
I've
loved
that
woman
But,
you
know,
she's
got
a
story.
We've
been
going
through
this
thing,
So
when
we
ran
into
you
yesterday,
this
thing
that
we've
been
going
she's
talking
about
it.
-
I
think
I
do.
Well...
Some
people
feel
like
They
walk
away
quietly
trying
to
close
the
gaps
to
the
past.
That's
a
hell
of
an
insight.
Jesus!
-
You're
not
Jesus,
are
you?
You
gonna
walk
across
the
water
No.
I'm
afraid
of
water.
Always
have
been.
Something
I've
gotta
get
over
sometime

you'll

Strong.
You
can
do
anything.
Money,
power
is
an
illusion.
You
can
be
here.
Me
and
you.
One,
two.
No,
no,
no.
Two,
three...
Don't
be
shy
with
it.
Get
it
moving
there.

That's
your
speed
right
here.
You
go
too
fast,
That's
it,
straight

straight
line,
See
how
you're
bearing?
Just
a
little
Wow,
look
at
this
view!
But
keep
your
eye
on
the
wheat,
here.
You
can
look
back
here
and
see
-
How
do
you
feel?
Okay,
keep
it
straight.
God
bless
you.
Make
yourself
some
money,
my
friend.
Okay.
Wayne.
Where
you
going?
Kevin,
you
know
I
love
you.
-
I'm
joking
with
you.
-
What
are
you
getting
so
hostile
for?
Me
and
you
are
on
the
same
side.
-
I'm
just
tired
of
the
teasing
a
lot.
Let
me
get
some...
-
Whoa.
He's
serious
about
this.
-
Can
we
just
play
cards?
$2,
$4,
$6,
just
put
all
the
money
in.
I
just
wanna
see
-
You
want
to
play?
-
Kevin,
what
have
you
got
for
the
week?
We're
at
260.
We're
gonna
stay
right
at
260,
We've
got
20,000
pounds.
We've
got
20,000
pounds
Maybe
just
do
all
that
after
lunch
Can
we
do
the
$500
reserves...
What
do
you
think
about
all
this?
I
like
all
this.
I
don't
think
he
can
do
it.
Is
there
a
library
where
I
can
get
books
Anything
at
all
to
do
with
hunting
smoking
it,
whatever
the
hell
it
is,
talk
to

over
there.

What's
your
fascination
I'm
going
to
Alaska.
Alaska,
Alaska?
Or
city
Alaska?
Because
they
do
have
markets
The
city
of
Alaska.
Not
in
Alaska.
No,
man.
Alaska,
Alaska.
I'm
gonna
be
all
the
way
out
there,
Just
on
my
own.
You
know,
no
fucking
watch,
Just
be
out
there.
Just
be
out
there
in
it.
You
know,
big
mountains,
rivers,
Just
be
out
there
in
it,
you
know?
-
In
the
wild.
-
Yeah.
What
are
you
doing
when
we're
there?
Now
you're
in
the
wild,
You're
just
living,
man.
You're
just
there,
in
that
moment,
Yeah.
Maybe
when
I
get
back,
Why
not?
You
know,
-
Society!
-
Society,
man!
-
Society!
Society!
Society,
you
know!
Society!
'Cause
you
know
I
don't
understand
why
people,
is
so
bad
to
each
other
so
fucking
often.
It
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
Judgment.
-
Well,
it
just...
You
know,
parents,
hypocrites,
politicians,
pricks.
This
is
a
mistake.
It's
a
mistake
to
get
too
deep
Alex,
you're
a
hell
of
a
young
guy,
But
I
promise
you
this.
You're
a
young
guy!
Can't
be
juggling
-
You've
got
to
just
kind
of...
-
What?
I'm
talking
about
blood
and
fire.
We're
talking
about
Who
are
you
to
be
giving
advice
Who
am
I
to
be
giving
advice
-
Yes.
-
My
name
is
Mr.
Happy.
And
Mr.
Happy
sometimes
gives
advice.
-
Alex,
please.
Sometimes
Mr.
Happy...
But
you
know
when
he's
happiest?
-
He's
not
always
happy.
Are
you
really
gonna
say
that
to
me?
I
am
going
to
say
that
to
you.
-
Now...
One
thing
that
you
should
try
is
what
happened
When
a
search
of
tax
records
Chris
had
given
Mom
and
Dad
became
They
hired
a
private
investigator
and
determined
to
track
him
down.
I
just
figured
he'd
be
with
gypsies,
These
are
those
free
satellite
TV
deals.
You're
the
one
who
said
it,
Alex,
not
me.
You're
gonna
need
something.
I'm
probably
gonna
get
like
a.22,
All
right,
then.
When
you
get
your
kill,
Now,
the
first
thing
you
wanna
do
that
you
got
that
meat
And
you
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
to
do
Depending
on
the
weather.
Especially
if
What
you
do
is
you
want
to
make
sure
Because
once
them
flies
start
you
know,
those
creepy
crawlies,
You
got
me.
You
got
me.
I
warned
Wayne
Mr.
Westerberg,
Scott
Baker,
FBI.
-
Impressive
turn-out.
You
mind
grabbing
that
zipper
-
Let's
go.
We're
gonna
have
to
shut
down
Alex,
you
come
back
Gil's
got
your
checks,
guys.
Remember
Alex,
no
Alaska
till
spring.
The
year
Chris
graduated
high
school,
he
bought
the
Datsun
used
He
stayed
away
most
of
the
summer.
Come
on.
The
neighbors
Can
you
spray
it?
As
soon
as
I
heard
he
was
home,
In
California,
He
discovered
that
our
parents'
stories
were
calculated
lies
When
they
met,
And
even
after
Chris
was
born,
Dad
had
had
another
son
to
whom
he
was
still
legally
married.
This
fact
suddenly
re-defined
Dad's
arrogance
made
him
conveniently
And
Mom,
in
the
shame
and
became
his
accomplice
in
deceit.
The
fragility
of
crystal
is
not
My
parents
understood
that
or
it
may
be
shattered.
But
when
it
came
to
my
brother,
that
their
course
of
secret
action
brought
the
kind
of
devastation
Their
fraudulent
marriage
was,
for
Chris,
He
felt
his
whole
life
turn,
the
direction
of
its
flow,
These
revelations
struck
at
the
core
They
made
his
entire
childhood
Chris
never
told
them
he
knew
and
made
me
promise
silence,
as
well.
I
can't
afford
four.
Bryan
can't
afford
four.
Does
it
matter?
Can
I
help
you?
Yeah.
If
I
wanted
where's
the
best
place
to
launch
out
of?
Hang
on
a
second.
"To
launch
out
of?"
-
Not
much.
A
permit?
Permit
for
what?
You
can't
paddle
down
the
river
If
you
want,
you
can
apply
for
one
here,
and
I'll
put
you
on
the
wait-list.
No,
I
got
this
guy
in
here.
There's
a
wait-list
That's
right.
-
Yeah,
it's
gonna
be...
Yeah,
hang
on
a
second.
Now,
the
deal
is
or
it's
gonna
be
me,
you
and
her.
Next
available
is
May
17th,
2003.
Great.
Done.
The
three
of
us,
then.
Twelve
years?
-
What's
that?
To
paddle
down
a
river.
Let
me
call
you
back.
You
can
do
that,
or
you
can
join
a
commercial
raft
trip,
They
may
have
some
but
that's
gonna
cost
you
$2,000.
Thank
you
very
much.
Helmet,
man!
I'm
Supertramp!
"If
we

Hello!
Hello.
Come.
Join
us.
We
have
hot
dogs.

I'm
Mads.
-
Mads.
Hi.
-
Alex.
Hey.
I'm
Sonja.
Hey,
Alex.
We
are
from
Copenhagen,
I
am.
-
You're
crazy!
You're
crazy,
man.
Sonja,
get
away
from
him.
Get
away
I'll
make
you
a
hot
dog.
One
minute.
I
love
this.
Don't
you
love
this?
You
know,
this
is
nature.
So
where
are
you
going?
-
I
haven't
decided
yet.
Well,
we
like
it
here
very
much.
So
good
to
meet
you.
You
know,
we
went
to
Los
Angeles,
Oh,
yeah.
Las
Vegas
is
very
nice.
-
The
universe
is
very
good.
-
Yeah.
Just
the
place.
The
city,
she
means.
But
then
we
came
here.
I
don't
care
You
know
you
can
actually
go
-
Yeah?
You
can
take
the
kayak,
down
to
Hoover
Dam,
and
then
from
there
you
can
take
-
Really?
Come
on,
come
on!
She's
so
slow
sometimes.
-
Here's
the
map.
-
Here.
Hoover
Dam.
About
330
kilometers,
I
think.
-
Miles?
-
Two
hundred
miles.
You
know,
I
wonder
if
I
could
paddle
all
the
way
down
that
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
you
can.
I
will
go
with
you.
We
leave
Sonja
here,
No,
no.
You
know,
because
in
every
man's
Oh,
man.
I've
gotta
go,
you
guys.
-
What's
going
on?
The
river
patrol's
after
me.
I'm
actually
You
have
to
have,
like,
a
permit,
it's
like
a
government
thing
to
be
here,
If
you
see
anybody,
just
tell
them
you
didn't
see
me,
okay?
Okay.
Okay,
again,
I'm
really,
really
sorry,
Take
care,
man.
-
All
right.
Take
care,
Mads.
-
Bye,
Alex.
Say
hello
to
Mexico
from
me.
Bye,
Alex!
It
would
be
Christmas
and
the
last
news
we'd
had
I
woke
up
a
couple
of
days
ago,
that
it
wasn't
only
my
parents
Honey?
It's
me.
I'm
sorry.
Give
me
another
chance.
Please
do
that...
Come
on.
Come
on.
They're
calling
and
I
ain't
got
it,
so
will
you
hurry
it
up?
Come
on
now,
don't
hang
up
on
me.
Hey,
here's
a
quarter.
Thank
you.
There's
a
quarter
so
I'm
on
here
talking
to
you
again.
I
got
the
quarter
now,
let's...
I
wondered
why
he
hadn't
tried
to
call
He
could've
hung
up
if
it
wasn't
me.
Why
wouldn't
he
send
a
letter,
It
hurt
a
little,
but
I
told
myself
it
was
good.
He
knew
I
loved
him
enough
And
it
helped
me
remember
that
there
more
than
anger
that
was
driving
him.
Chris
had
always
been
driven,
When
he
was
four
years
old,
he
once
wandered
six
blocks
away
He
was
found
in
a
neighbor's
kitchen
up
on
a
chair,
Whatever
drawer
he
was
opening
now
-
You
lived
in
a
cave
for
36
days?
And
how
did
you
get
into
Mexico
Through
the
spillway
at
Morelos
Dam.
River
dries
out
pretty
quickly
Yeah.
Turns
into
a
maze
of
irrigation
So
I
ported
my
kayak
over
the
desert,
But
after
a
few
weeks,
a
sandstorm
So
I
walked
back
north.
Here
I
am.
Well,
you
just
can't
be
crossing
-
Are
we
understood?
I've
eaten
enough
sand
to
send
me
All
right.
Sit
tight.
I'll
be
right
back.
Some
may
ask,
The
answer
is
clear.
Hi.
Do
you
have
the
time?
-
Time?
Yeah.
Okay.
Front
and
back.
I
don't
have
any
more
clipboards,
-
Next.
Can
you
tell
me
how
to
get
an
ID?
-
Did
you
lose
your
identification,
sir?
No
birth
certificate?
Nothing?
Ouch.
All
right.
Well,
you're
gonna
You
can
catch
them
in
the
morning.
and
we
can
help
you
So
just
come
to
this
desk
-
Okay.
-
Alexander
Supertramp.
-
Alexander
Supertramp.
Yeah.
Okay,
so
I'm
gonna
look
for
you,
-
Here
you
go,
Supertramp.
Okay,
baby.
-
And
one
last
thing.
Do
you
have
a
bed
for
me?
I'm
sorry...
Oh,
no.
Sure,
I
got
a
bed
for
you.
You
fill
this
out.
And
I'll
set
you
right
up.
-
What's
going
on
back
there?
-
Come
on,
now.
Work
with
me.
Supertramp,
huh?
You
know
the
drill.
Move
it!
Thanks,
but
I'm
not
gonna
need
You
leaving
us
so
soon?
Supertramp!
Show
me
your
face.
If
I
see
yours
again,
This
is
the
goddamned
railroad,
and
we
will
do
whatever
we
have
to
do
to
keep
you
freeloaders
Yes,
sir.
You
got
any
ID?
-
No,
sir.
Last
time,
my
friend.
All
clear.
Good
boy!
Yeah!
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
It's
a
mystery
to
me
We
have
a
greed
You
think
you
have
to
want
more
Until
you
have
it
all
you
won't
be
freed
Society,
you're
a
crazy
breed
I
hope
you're
not
lonely
without
me
When
you
want
more
than
you
have
And
when
you
think
more
than
you
want
I
think
I
need
to
find
a
bigger
place
'Cause
when
you
have
You
need
more
space
Society,
you're
a
crazy
breed
I
hope
you're
not
lonely
without
me
Society,
crazy
indeed
I
hope
you're
not
lonely
without
me
Thanks
a
lot.
In
the
letters
it
was
clear
his
anguish
and
problems
He
said
I
was
who
could
possibly
understand
With
whose
money
are
you
buying
I
work.
The
only
reason
you're
wandering
around
acting
like
I
am
making
the
contacts
You
don't
care
at
all
about
what
I
do!
I
don't
even
want
to
talk
to
you
Don't
you
walk
away
from
me,
woman!
Kids!
Look
what
your
dad
For
God's
sake,
Fuck
you!
I
hate
you!
There
ain't
gonna
be
no
party.
Cancel
Christmas?
That's
right!
I'm
God!
Well,
you're
not
God.
That's
bullshit!
We're
10
deep!
Alex,
I
don't
mean
to
be
on
you
about
I
wanna
keep
you
on
and
but
you've
got
to
start
wearing
socks.
With
almost
a
year
having
passed
my
parents'
anger,
their
desperation,
their
guilt
was
giving
way
to
pain.
And
pain
seemed
to
bring
them
closer.
Even
their
faces
had
changed.
She
convinces
herself
it's
Chris,
that
it's
her
son
That
it's
her
son
And
I
fear
for
the
mother
in
her.
Instincts
that
seem
to
sense
the
threat
and
irrevocable
that
the
mind
balks
I'd
begin
to
wonder
if
I
can
understand
but
I
catch
myself
and
remember
that
these
are
not
the
parents
but
people
softened
by
the
forced
Still,
everything
Chris
is
saying
And
I
trust
for
him
that
This
is
our
life.
Big
game.
Very
big
game.
Got
it.
Damn
it!
Get
off!
"Hey,
Dad,
can
I
light
the
barbeque,
"Well,
Son,
"Come
on,
Dad.
Please,
Dad,
please?"
"Well,
why
not,
Walt?
"Shut
up,
Carine!
Shut
up,
Carine!
"No,
Billie.
I
told
you
once.
"Okay?
"You
hear
me?
You
hear
me,
woman?
"You
hear
me,
woman?
Huh?
"Sorry.
Sorry,
Walt.
I'm
sorry."
Shit.
No!
No!
Damn
it!
God
damn
it!
Fuck!
"There
was
clearly
felt
the
presence

Hey,

No.
No!

you
gonna
stay
with
us
long?
Well,
I'm
waiting
on
a
check
to
come
into
Salton
City
I've
got
to
start
thinking
about
When
the
sun
gets
a
little
lower
tonight,
After
the
check
comes
in,
some
big
old
mountains
I
can
climb
I've
got
to
see
I've
still
got
a
lot
of
supplies
So,
I
might
get
another
job
Hell,
we'd
give
you
a
little
something
for
I'm
not
taking
It's
been
a
real
great
twist
You
two
look
like
you're
doing
good.
-
We
are
doing
good.
We're
doing
real
good.
Speaking
of
which,
don't
you
think
you
ought
to
introduce
yourself
I...
-
Hi.
You
selling
these
books?
I
am.
We
are.
He
was.
I
like
to
read.
-
Do
you?
That's
good.
I
heard
you
play
your
song
last
night.
-
I'm
terrible.
Thank
you.
I
was
gonna
go
take
a
walk
-
You
wanna
go?
-
Hi.
I'd
like
to
show
you
around
up
here.
A
lot
of
tourists
come
in
here
and
they
look
at
that
car
door
up
there.
And
I
found
car
doors
and
put
them
Where
did
you
get
the
telephone
poles?
A
lot
of
people
in
the
valley
Everybody
now,
I
think,
And
I
want
to
have
the
wisdom
And
that's
about
it.
You
really
believe
in
love,
then.
Yeah.
Totally.
This
is
a
love
story
that
is
staggering
That
God
really
loves
us
a
lot.
Does
that
answer
that?
-
Yeah.
I
really
love
it
here.
I
think
the
freedom
To
me,
I
wouldn't
move
for
$10
million,

I'm
contented

gets
better.

If
you
want
to,
And
I'm
gonna
do
the
same
thing,
You're
doing
real
good.
You
can
wipe
your
hands
off
on
my
shirt
This
is
starting
to
make
me
hungry.
I
was
just
a
couple
of
years
older
-
Wow.
Yeah,
I
thought
my
husband
and
I
were
and
babies
and
love
and
that
didn't
quite
work
out
that
way.
He
left
me.
So,
I...
Anyway,
whatever,
but
I
ended
up
raising
Reno
on
my
own.
Then
I
met
Rainey.
That
was
sweet.
You
know,
Reno
was
and
he
was
just
on
his
way
And
I
haven't
even
heard
from
him
I
don't
even
know
where
he
is.
I
hope
I
get
to
meet
him
sometime.
Do
your
folks
know
where
you
are?
Hey,
guys?
Yeah,
we
are.
We're
hungry.
I'll
be
all
right.
You
want
to
come
and
eat?
Or
we'll
sit
here.
Let's
go.
Let's
go.
Guys,
come
on.
It's
getting
cold.
Check
this
out.
Tawdry?
That
poor
girl
is
about
ready
And
here
you
are,
-
So
Jan
talked
to
you
about
Reno,
huh?
-
So
Jan
talked
to
you
about
Reno,
huh?
Children
can
be
pretty
harsh
You
planning
on
seeing
yours?
I've
only
got
one
plan,
Rainey.
That
would
be
Alaska?
Alaska.
Hello?
-
Merry
Christmas.
My
parents
went
into
town.
No.
Yeah.
They
went
to
call
my
grandma
No,
I
mean
we
can't
do
that.
Why
not?
How
old
are
you?
Eighteen.
Seventeen.
What
year
were
you
born?
So
I'm
16.
You
want
to
do
something
together?
You
can
send
mail
to
this
address
I
don't
know
when
I'm
going
to
get
it,
You're
pretty
magic.
-
Yeah?
And
just
remember
if
you
want
something
in
life,
-
You
take
care,
kiddo.
-
New
Year's
resolution?
Just
get
your
pack
I
don't
think
I
could
take
a
hug.
Hey.

Alex?
Where
you
from,
Alex?
-
West
Virginia.
Well,
this
is
something
out
here.
Don't
you...
Don't
you
worry
about
those
dope
No,
they
keep
to
themselves
You
strike
me
as
a
bright
young
man.
I
think
I've
got
Well,
that's
what
I
mean.
How
long
you
been
out
here?
-
Couple
of
weeks.
A
lot
of
places.
-
Well,
how
old
are
you?
Twenty-three
years
old!
Son,
don't
you
think
And
a
job?
Look,
Mr.
Franz,
I
think
careers
are
a
20th
century
You
don't
need
to
worry
about
me.
I'm
not
destitute.
-
In
the
dirt?
-
Where's
your
family?
That's
a
shame.
Hey,
Mr.
Franz,
Come
on.
Come
on.
It's
getting
a
little
steep.
All
right,
but
even
from
halfway
out,
From
the
top,
you
can
see
all
the
way
You
can
see

Sea
Yes,
sir.
My
goodness.

You
don't
want
to
go
up?
I
spent
most
of
my
life
in
the
Army.
New
Year's
Eve,
1957,
My
wife
and
son
were
here
in
the
States
and
some
fella
who'd
had
too
much
Killed
them
both.
Now
you
might
think
is
go
to
the
whiskey.
But
at
the
time,
And
I
did
it
hard!
But
pretty
soon
I
realized
I
wasn't
doing
my
wife
and
son
any
good
So
I
pulled
myself
together
cold
turkey.
So
since
all
that,
this
is
pretty
much
me.
Do
you
ever
travel,
Mr.
Franz?
No,
I
can't
seem
to
get
too
far
I
do
a
lot
of
leather
engraving.
Between
that
and
my
pension,
But
every
time
I
think
I
get
too
far
behind
on
orders
and
such
When
we
finish
eating,
-
Would
you?
I
was
hoping
you'd
say
that.
-
It's
amazing
how
malleable
this
is.
When
the
leather
is
wet
you
can
really...
-
It's
like
butter.
It's
amazing.
And
then
it
hardens

So
I

And
I
took
the

I
can
ask
you
Except
I
already
know

answer!
You

I

Mr.

Get
out
of
that
lonely
house,
Get
back
out
on
the
road!
Really!
You're
going
to
live
a
long
time,
Ron!
You
should
make
a
radical
change
I
mean,
the
core
of
man's
spirit
And
there
you
are,
stubborn
old
man,
-
Sitting
on
my

I'll
show
you

on
my
butt!
"Stubborn

Ron.
that
the
joy
of
life
comes
principally
God's
placed
it
all
around
us.
It's
in
anything
we
can
experience.
People
just
need
to
change
the
way
Yeah,
I'm
gonna
take
stock
of
that.
No,
I
am.
I
am.
I
am.
But
I
wanted
to
tell
you
something.
From
the
bits
and
pieces
I
put
together,
you
know,
from
what
you
told
me
about
And
I
know
you've
got
your
problems
But
there's
some
kind
of
bigger
thing
and
it
sounds
like
But
when
you
forgive,
you
love.
And
when
you
love,
God's
light
shines
on
you.
-
Holy
shit.
I
told
you
so!

fucking
hungry!

hungry!

a
moment
she
rediscovered
"She
was
here
on
earth
to
grasp
"and
to
call
each
thing
"By
its
right
name."
What
is
this?
What
is
this
one?
This
is
Viburnum
edule.
Hedysarum
alpinum.
Hedysarum
alpinum
is
wild
potato
root.
Epilobium
angustifolium.
Fireweed.
Fuck
it
all.
Fuck
it
all!
Hi.
What
are
you
doing
up?
I
heard
you
get
off
the
couch
Had
a
funny
feeling
I'm
gonna
drive
you
100
miles
to
a
plane
or
hitch
a
ride
I'd
take
you
all
the
way
to
Alaska
-
Ron,
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
Get
you
started
on
this
thing
of
yours.
-
On
my
great...
On
your
great
Alaskan
adventure.
Here.
Here's
a
machete.
Collapsible
fishing
pole,
a
few
other
-
Ron...
I'll
get
dressed
Well,
my
friend.
Yep.
I
had
an
idea.
You
know,
my
mother
was
an
only
child
and
so
was
my
father,
and
I
was
their
only
child,
so
when
I'm
gone,
My
family
will
be
finished.
What
do
you
say
you
let
me
adopt
you?
I
can
be,
say,
your
grandfather.
Ron,
could
we
talk
about
this
Would
that
be
okay?
Yeah,
yeah.
We
can
do
that.
Yeah.
All
right,
Ron.
Thank
you.
What
did
his
voice
sound
like
now?
What
would
he
tell
about
now?
...nine,
ten.
I
realized
that
the
words
to
my
thoughts
Chris
was
writing
his
story,
and
it
had
to
be
Chris
who
would
tell
it.
"To
call
each
thing
by
its
right
name.
"By
its
right
name."
What
if
I
were
smiling
and
running
into
your
arms?
Would
you
see
then
