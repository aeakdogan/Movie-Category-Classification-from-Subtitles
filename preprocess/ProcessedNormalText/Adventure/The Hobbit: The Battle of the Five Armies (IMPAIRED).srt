honor

Because

gave

your
word.

mean

Be
gone!
Ere

one
thing.

Aye.

Yes.
Sorry...

that.
I
came...
...to
give
you...

The
Heart
of
the

The
King's
Jewel.
And
worth
a

ransom.
How
is
this...

it
as

no

I'm
not

it
for

They're
suspicious
and

...with
the
worst

loyal

I've

this

as

Imagine
what

I'm
not
afraid
of

Well,

BILBO:
The

I
gave
it

You?
I
took
it
as
my

No,

No!

See

He's
