These
violent
delights
And
in
their
triumph
die,
Which,
as
they
kiss,
consume...
Gran?
Edward,
don't!
Okay.
Grandma,
I
would
like
Happy
birthday,
Bella.
Happy
birthday,
Bells.
I
thought
we
agreed,
Well,
the
one
from
me
So,
don't
count.
It's
actually
great.
Uh,
goes
with
this
one
We
coordinated.
It's
to
put
your
pictures
in,
Senior
year.
How'd
you
get
so
old
so
fast?
It's
not
that
old.
Is
that
a
grey
hair?
No!
No
way!
Happy
Birthday.
It's
really
funny.
Another
missing
hiker
brings
The
Rangers
are
searching
Oh,
it's
Bella.
Today
is
the
big
day,
Bella.
Uh,
R
and
J
essay
due?
Wherefore
art
thou,
Bella?
I
want
to
take
a
picture
of
you
guys.
...wants
me
to
put
together,
like...
...a
scrapbook
full
of
memories.
I
take
them,
I'm
not
in
them.
You'll
Photoshop
my
nose
Don't
worry,
I'm
in
the
picture.
It's
good.
Oh,
good.
Well,
catch
you
later.
Happy
birthday.
Bella,
your
birth
is
definitely
But
my
aging
is
not.
I
think
18
is
all
youngster,
It's
one
year
older
than
you.
No,
it
isn't.
I'm
a
hundred
and
nine.
Maybe
I
should
not
be
dating
It's
gross!
I
should
feel
certainly
repulse.
We
have
to
go
to
class.
Wait
a
second.
Someone
wants
you.
Bella.
I'll
leave
you
to
talk.
Hello,
biceps!
You
know,
anabolic
steroids
are
Well,
I'm
just
filling
out,
Bella.
You
know,
wouldn't
seem
so
drastic
We
should
switch
schools.
Then
you
can
come
hang
out
I'm
alright.
I
prefer
the
Res
school's
exclusivity.
They
let
any
old
rift
raft
into
this
place.
I
see.
I
was
just
buying
a
part
for
the
Rabbit.
You
should
really
come,
take
a
ride,
Is
it
fast?
Okay.
Hey,
happy
birthday.
Your
Dad
told
my
Dad.
Yeah,
of
course,
he
did.
I
saw
this
the
other
day
and
It
catches
bad
dreams.
It's
perfect.
Thank
you.
See
you
soon.
Bye.
So,
how
come
Jacob
Black
gets
to
Because
I
have
nothing
Bella,
you
give
me
everything
See?
Thank
you.
Bella!
Happy
Birthday!
I
thought,
I
said
you,
I've
already
seen
you
open
it
You
love
it!
You're
goanna
wear
it
tonight,
Come
on,
please?
Okay.
alright.
Jasper,
no
fair
Sorry,
Bella.
Happy...
Never
mind.
You
can't
trust
vampires.
Trust
me!
O,
my
love!
Death
that
hath
sucked
Hath
had
no
power
yet
Thou
art
not
conquered.
Beauty's
ensign
yet
is
crimson
in
thy
lips
And
death's
pale
flag
I
hate
being
celebrated.
There
are
worse
tragedies.
Him,
look
at
Romeo.
He
kills
his
true
love
Yeah.
Though
I
do
envy
him,
Juliet.
She's
like
perfect.
If
you
like
that
obviously
No,
not
the
girl,
dear.
The
suicide.
It's
nearly
impossible
for...
...some
people.
For
humans,
...a
dagger
to
the
heart...
So
many
different
options.
Why
would
you
say
that?
Because
I
considered
it
once.
I
didn't
know,
I
had
to
come
up
with
...plan.
And
what
was
the
plan?
I
would
go
to
Italy,
...and
provoke
the
Volturi.
The
what?
Now,
who
would
like
to
repeat
just
to
show,
Mr.
Cullen.
Oh,
yes,
Mr.
Birdy.
O,
here.
Will
I
set
up
my
everlasting
rest,
And
shake
the
yoke
of
inauspicious
stars
Eyes,
look
your
last!
Arms,
take
your
last
embrace!
And
lips,
O
you,
...seal
with
a
righteous
kiss.
A
dateless
bargain
to
engrossing
death!
Eyes
on
the
screen,
people.
Thus
with
a
kiss
I
die.
The
Volturi
are
a
very
old,
I
guess,
the
closest
thing
to
royalty
Is
that
Carlisle?
He
lived
with
them
Described
them
as
No
respect
for
human
life,
...respect
for
the
arts
And
the
law...
...above
all
of
law.
And
vampires
have
laws?
Not
very
many.
There's
only
one
and
What
is
it?
To
keep
the
existence
We
don't
make
spectacles
And
we
don't
kill
conspicuously.
Unless,
of
course,
We
have
to
talking
about
that.
I
can't
even
think...
...about
someone
hurting
you.
Bella,
the
only
thing
that
And
I
don't
have
anything
else
That's
not
true.
Victoria?
Alice
will
see
...we
will
be
ready.
If
you
change
me.
Bella,
you
already
do
protect
me.
You're
my
only
reason...
...to
stay
alive,
But
it's
my
job
to
protect
you.
From
everyone
except
my
sister.
It's
time!
It's
time!
It's
time!
Sorry
about
all
this.
Like
it's
even
possible.
Happy
big
Birthday,
Bella!
I
found
it
in
your
bag,
mind?
Dating
an
older
woman?
What?
You
first,
Rosalie.
It's
a
necklace.
Alice
picked
it
up.
Show
me
the
love!
This
is
from
Emmett.
Already
installed
it
in
your
truck.
Finally,
a
decent
sound
system
Hey,
don't...
don't
hate
the
truck.
Open
Esme
and
Carlisle's.
Just
a
little
something
We
think,
you
looking
Paper
cut.
Jas...
Jas!
It's
okay.
...blood.
Get
Jasper
out
of
here.
I'm
sorry...
I'll
have
to
stitch
this
up
Check
on
Jasper.
I'm
sure,
he's
very
upset
with
himself.
And
I
doubt
he'll
listen
to
anyone
Edward?
I
never
wanted
that
party.
Jasper
hasn't
been
away
from
human
blood
How
do
you
do
it?
Years
and
years
of
practice.
Did
you
ever
think
it
of...
...just
doing
it
the
easier
way?
No.
I
knew
who
I
wanted
to
be.
I
wanted
to
help
people.
Brings
me
happiness.
Even
if
I'm
damned
about
this.
Damned?
Like...
like
hell?
Carlisle,
you
can't
be
damned.
You
couldn't,
it's
impossible.
Thank
you,
Bella.
You
always
been
very...
...gracious
about
us.
So,
that's
it?
That's
why
he
won't
change
me?
Imagine
the
situation
in
reverse.
If
you
believed
as
Edward
does...
...would
you
take
away
his
soul?
You
can't
protect
me.
From
everything.
At
some
point,
It's
goanna
be
an
accident,
...or
illness,
...or
old
age.
As
long
as
I'm
human.
And
the
only
solution
That's
not
a
solution,
You're
not
goanna
love
me
Bella,
do
you
not
understand
Carlisle
told
me...
...how
you
feel
about
your
soul.
I
don't
believe
that.
So
don't
worry
about
mine.
You
should
go
inside.
It's
still
my
birthday.
Can
I
ask
one
thing?
Kiss
me?
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
Hi.
Come
for
a
walk
with
me.
We
got
to
leave
Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's
supposed
to
be
People
are
starting
to
notice.
Okay,
I...
I
got
to
think
of
something
When
you
say
"we"...
I
mean
to
my
family
and
myself.
Edward,
what
happened
with
Jasper,
...it's
nothing.
It
was
nothing.
Nothing
the
way
And
nothing
compared
to
You
just
don't
belong
I
belong
with
you.
No,
you
don't.
I'm
coming.
Bella.
I
don't
want
you
to
come.
You
don't
want
me?
No.
This
changes
things.
alright.
But
if
it's
not
...can
you
at
least
Don't
do
anything
reckless.
For
Charlie's
sake.
And
I'll
promise
something
This
is
the
last
time
I
won't
come
back.
And
you
can
go
on
...without
any
interference
from
me.
It
will
be
like...
I
never
existed,
If
this
is
about
my
soul,
take
it.
I
don't
want
without
you.
You're
just
not
good
for
me.
I'm
not
good
enough
for
you?
I'm
just
sorry,
Please...
...don't.
Goodbye.
Edward?
Edward!
Edward!
I'll
try
to
call
Cullens
place
again.
The
Cullens
left
town,
Charlie.
Where
did
they
go?
We'll
find
her,
Charlie.
Charlie?
She's
alright.
I
got
her.
Thank
you,
Sam.
Alice,
...you
have
disappeared.
Like
everything
else.
But
who
else
can
I
talk
to?
When
you
left...
and
he
left...
You
took
everything
with
you.
But
the
absence
of
him
It's
like
a
huge
hole...
...has
been
punched
through
my
chest.
But
in
a
way
I'm
glad.
The
pain
is
my
only
reminder
that
...that
you
all
were.
alright,
that's
it.
What?
You're
going
to
Jacksonville
I'm
not
leaving
Forks.
Bells...
...he's
not
coming
back.
I
know.
It's
just
not
normal,
Quite
frankly,
it's
scaring
...and
you
Mother.
Baby,
I...
I
don't
want
you
to
leave.
I
don't.
But...
just
go...
Go
to
Jacksonville,
I
like
my
old
friends.
I
do,
yeah.
I'm...
...goanna
go
shopping
tomorrow,
You
hate
shopping.
I...
I
need
a
girl's
night
out.
alright.
Shopping.
I
like
it,
go.
Buy
some
good
stuff.
Hi,
Jessica,
it's
Bella.
Oh,
yeah,
Bella
Swan.
I
don't
know,
why
you
want
to
sit
through
...and
no
hot
guys
kissing
anybody.
Like
why
there
are
Is
it
supposed
to
like
My
cousin
had
leprosy,
And
like
is
it
supposed
to
be
Because
don't
be
so
pleased
with
...self-reverential
cleverness,
you
know?
Like,
some
girls
like
to
shop.
Not
all
girls,
apparently.
I
was
surprised
Like,
your
depression
thing.
After
a
while,
it's
like,
And
I'm
going
through
Like
Mike
deciding
That's
hard,
you
know?
What's
up,
guys?
Where
you
going?
Keep
walking.
This
is
dangerous.
Dude,
come
on.
I
think,
I
know
those
guys.
Well,
they
seem
great.
I
just
need
to
see
something.
Hey,
girlie!
alright,
alright!
Turn
around.
Sorry,
I
thought
That's
cool!
I'll
be
whomever
So,
what
do
you
say?
You
promised
me
nothing
reckless.
You
promised,
it
would
as
You
lied.
You
know
what?
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Hey,
um,
what
the
hell
is
Just
curious.
I
thought
that
I
saw
something.
You're
insane,
actually.
That
homeboy
I
was
about
to
end
up
...like
some
lame
TV
show.
Oh,
that
was
such
a
rush.
Awesome!
So,
you're
an
adrenaline
junky
now?
That's
cool!
You
don't
get
on
the
back
of
some
Crazy!
Alice,
I
saw
him.
Maybe
I'm
crazy
now,
If
the
rush
of
danger
is
...then
that's
what
I'll
find.
Bella!
Where
the
hell
have
you
been,
crazy?
I...
brought
you
something.
It's
a
little
crazy.
Wow,
scrap
metal!
You
shouldn't
have.
I
think,
they'll
probably
cost
...but
then
I
thought
that...
if
I
had
a
mechanic-type
friend
Huh,
me?
Being
the
mechanic-type
friend?
Since
when
are
you
into
motorcycles?
I
get
it
if
you
think
this
is
Yeah,
it's
completely
When
do
we
start?
Now.
Please.
Oh,
hey,
be
careful.
...heavy.
So,
Jacob,
you're
like
buff.
How
that
can
happen?
Age
is
just
a
number,
baby.
Feels
like
that
sometimes.
That
song
was
good.
I
don't
really
like...
...music
anymore
kind
of...
Okay.
I
was
thinking,
...and
hopefully
we
will...
We
have
to,
like,
fit
some
homework
I
don't
want
Billy
thinking
that
You
influence
me?
Are
you...?
So
that
makes
me
the
influencer
No,
no,
no.
My
size
and
knowledge
base
actually
Because
of
your
gentle
paleness
I
convinced
you
to
build
Don't
you
think
that
makes
Okay.
I'm
thirty
five...
...and
you
might
be
like
32.
Jake,
you
in
there?
It's...
It's
just
my
boys.
Hey,
Jake.
Bella,
that's
Quill
and
Embry.
I'm
Quill
Ateara.
So
the
bike
building
story
is
true.
Oh,
yeah,
yeah!
What
about
the
part
Uh,
we're
friends,
you
know?
Actually,
I
remember,
I
said
Embry,
do
you
remember
him
Nope!
So
you
guys
have
girlfriends.
Yeah,
right.
Quills
actually
taken
his
cousin
to
prom.
Yeah,
that's
still
a
riot.
You
want
funny,
Black?
Jesus!
I
got
five
bucks
on
Quill.
Dear
Alice,
I
wish,
I
wish,
I
could
tell
you
He
makes
me
feel
better.
I
mean,
The
hole
in
my
chest...
...while
when
I'm
with
Jake,
It's
like,
it
almost
healed.
Quill
keeps
asking
to
come
over.
I
think
he
likes
you
Oh,
I'm
really
not
into
What's
up
with
you
and
age?
I
mean,
how
old
was
that
But
even
Jake
can't
keep
Hey,
Bella!
You're
alright.
You're
okay?
I
thought
this
thing
was
...but
I
guess
not.
Can
I
ask
you
something?
Hanging
out
with
Jacob...
...does
seems
to
take
your
mind
You
know,
sometimes...
...you
got
to
learn
to
love
You
know,
what
I
mean?
Of
course,
what
do
I
know?
I'm
just
a
terminal
bachelor.
Famous
ladies
man.
Okay...
Go
to
bed.
I
love
you.
If
I
told
you,
...I
couldn't
have
fixed
these
bikes,
Are
you
doubting
your
mad
skills?
No,
definitely
not.
It's
just...
May
be
if
I
was
smarter
If
you
told
me,
I
would
say
that
that's...
...really
too
bad
but...
...he's
goanna
find
something
else
to
do.
Is
that
Sam
Utley?
Yeah,
and
his
cult.
Oh,
my
God!
Did
you
see
that?
They're
not
really
fighting,
Bella.
They're
cliff
diving.
Scary
as
hell,
Rush?
We'll
leave
the
showing
off
Is
some
kind
of
beef
Oh,
no.
They
just
think
they
run
this
place.
Embry
used
to
call
them
hall
Now,
look
at
him.
Yeah.
He
missed
some
school...
...and
all
of
a
sudden
started
following
Same
thing
with
Paul
and
Jared.
Sam
keeps
giving
me
this
look,
...like
he's
waiting
for
me
It's
kind
of
starting
to
freak
me
out.
Well,
you
should
just
avoid
him.
I'll
try.
Okay.
You
look
scared.
Alright!
Brake.
Clutch.
Good.
Gas.
Ready?
Now
slowly...
release
the
clutch.
Bella.
Stop.
You
alright?
I'm
goanna
go
again.
Hit
the
brake!
I
want
to
go
again.
I'll
try
again.
No
more
bikes.
Man,
your
head.
Oh,
my
God,
I'm
sorry.
You're
apologizing
for
bleeding?
Yeah,
I
guess,
I
am.
It's
just
blood,
Bella.
What
are
you
staring
at?
You're
sort
of
beautiful.
How
hard
did
you
hit
your
head?
I
don't
know.
Let's
go.
I
did
see
something
in
the
woods.
No,
he
doesn't.
It
was
jet
black
and
huge.
On
all
fours,
it
was
still
taller
A
bear,
may
be?
Or
an
alien.
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
I
saw
it.
You're
not
the
only
one.
My
Dad's
been
getting
reports
Like
five
hikers
been
killed
by
some
bear.
But
they
can't
find
the
bear.
Last
time
you
clowns
So,
I
mean...
Bella
is
back.
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
So
listen,
not
now
that...
...eating
again,
you
know?
You
got
to
get
that
protein
in
there.
I
was
just
wondering,
Yeah,
sure.
Cool,
um,
let
me
see...
We
could
check
out
Yeah,
it's
a
dumb
title,
I
mean,
it's
supposed
to
be.
How
about
"Face
Punch"?
Well,
it's
an
action
movie.
With
guns...
adrenaline...
...it's
my
thing
We
should
get
a
bunch
of
people
to
go.
..."Face
Punch"?
Mike,
hey,
we
were
supposed
Remember
the
trailer's
like...
Punch
his
face
in.
Movie
night
with
Bella!
So,
"Face
Punch",
huh?
Not
really.
I
heard
it
sucks.
Bad.
Hey,
are
you
even
old
enough
I
mean,
you
know,
without
adult
supervision?
Well,
she's
buying
my
ticket
for
me.
Jessica
bailed
...so
Eric's
taking
care
of
her.
So,
it's
just
us
three.
Great.
Put
the
gun
down.
Put
your
gun
down
or
I'm
goanna
Both
of
you!
Put
both
of
your
guns
down
or
I'm
goanna
Alright,
let's
do
this!
Okay,
I
think
I'm
goanna
throw
up!
Jesus!
You
should
hold
out
for
someone
Someone
who
laughs
at
the
gore
Yeah,
I'll
keep
my
eye
open
for
that.
I
feel
bad.
...going
around.
What?
I
can't
hold
your
hand?
I
just
think
it
means
So...
Okay,
tell
me
something.
And
you
think,
I'm
sort
beautiful?
Jake,
please...
Why?
Because
you
are
about
And
I
need
you.
Well,
I've
got
loads
of
time.
I'm
not
goanna
give
up.
I
don't
want
you
to.
But...
It's
just
because
I
don't
want
you
It's...
it's
really
selfish.
You
know,
I'm
not
like
a
car
I'm
never
goanna
run
right.
So
I
should
be
fair
to
you.
It's
because
of
him,
right?
Look,
I
know
what
he
did
to
you.
But,
Bella,
I
would
never,
I
won't
ever
hurt
you.
I
won't
let
you
down.
You
can
count
on
me.
Well...
I
need
to
go
home.
I'm...
I
was
feeling
sick
What
is
your
problem?
You
are
my
problem.
Feeling
sick?
Do
you
want
me
Jake...
Jake,
the
movie's
over.
Jake,
you're
really
hot.
Like,
you
feel
like
you
have
a
fever.
I
don't
know
what's
happening.
I
got
to
go.
That
dude
is
weird.
Jake.
Uh,
your
Dad
says
you
have
mono.
He
won't
let
me
visit
but...
Hey,
uh,
it's
me
again.
I'm
sorry
about
what
I
said
I
just
wanted
to
hear
your
voice.
Jacob,
please
call
me.
Okay,
we
should
be
Hey!
Look,
I
don't
have
to
go
fishing
today.
Yeah,
you
do.
Go.
Just
be
careful.
Those
bears
won't
get
My
kung
foo
is
strong.
Jake!
You
cut
your
hair?
And
got
a
tattoo?
Bella...
I
thought
you
were
too
sick
Or
pick
up
the
phone
Go
away.
Go
away.
What
happened
to
you?
Hey,
what
happened?
Did
Sam
get
to
you?
Sam's
trying
to
help
me,
But
if
you
want
somebody
to
blame,
How
about
those
The
Cullens.
I
don't
know
You
know
exactly
You
been
lying
to
everyone.
But
you
can't
lie
to
me.
Not
anymore,
Bella.
Look,
Bella...
We
can't
be
friends
anymore.
Jake,
I
know
that
...hurting
you.
It's...
it's
killing
me.
If
you,
may
be,
Don't!
It's
not
you.
It's
not
you,
it's
me,
right?
It's
true!
I'm
not
good.
I
used
to
be...
a
great
kid.
Not
anymore.
It
doesn't
even
matter,
alright?
You
can't
break
up
with
me.
I
mean...
I
mean,
you're
my
best
friend.
You
promised
me.
I
know.
I
promised
that
And
this
is
me
keeping
that
promise.
Go
home.
And
don't
come
back.
Alice...
Things
are...
Things
are
bad
again.
Without
Jake,
I
just...
I
don't
see
Edward
anymore.
Now
it
really
feels
like
I
will
find
a
place
Bella.
I
didn't
expect
to
find
you
here.
I
went
to
visit
the
Cullens,
but...
I'm
surprised
they
left
you
behind.
Weren't
you
sort
of
a,
um,
...a
pet
of
theirs?
Yeah.
You
could
say
that.
Do
they
Cullens
visit
often?
Lie.
Yeah,
absolutely,
all
the
time.
I'll
tell
them
that
you
stopped
by.
I
probably
shouldn't
tell...
...to
Edward.
Because
he's
pretty
protective.
Why
are
you
here?
I
came
as
a
favour
to
Victoria.
Victoria?
She
asked
me
to
see
...under
the
protection
Victoria
feels
it's
only
fair
...given
he
killed
hers.
An
eye
for
an
eye.
Threaten
him.
And
he'd
come
after
you.
I
don't
think
he
will.
After
all,
how
much
could
...if
he
left
you
here
unprotected?
Victoria
won't
be
happy
But
I
can't
help
myself.
You're
so
mouth-watering.
I
mean,
you'd
helped
us.
Don't
be
afraid.
Victoria
plans
on
killing
you
...whereas
I'll
make
it
quick.
You
will
feel
nothing.
Edward,
I
love
you.
I
don't
believe
it.
Dad,
I
saw
them!
What's
the
matter?
What
you
mean
in
the
woods?
Bella,
what
the
hell
were
you
doing
They
are
wolves.
Are
you
sure
about
that,
Bella?
They
were
after...
something.
Wolves?
You
saw?
Alright.
...feel
like
going
hunting?
Can
you
get
some
of
Sure,
yeah.
I'll...
I
know
that
those
wolves
And
Laurent
would
have
told
her
Victoria.
I
should
go
to
the
station.
Dad,
you
should...
You
can
just
stay
in
the
house?
Bella!
Oh,
you
scared
me.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Look,
look,
I'm
sorry.
For
what?
...but
I
literally...
can't!
Have
you
ever
had
a
secret
One
that
wasn't
yours
to
share.
Well,
that's
what
Or
worse.
You
have
no
idea,
I
hate
this.
I
hate
what
they
have
I
mean,
the
killer
part
is
Bella,
do
you
remember,
The
stop...
The
story...
I
guess,
I
understand
why
that's
There
must
got
to
be
something
No.
May
be
we
should
just
We'll
just
leave.
You
can
do
that?
I'll
do
it
for
you.
It's
not
something
But
I
would
run
away
with
you.
If
I
could.
I
got
to
go.
Come
here.
Please...
It
would
be
so
much
easier
I
tried,
but...
Jake,
what
are
you
doing?
Jake!
Edward,
I'm
scared.
You
should
be.
Really
it's
just
like
an
old
story...
That
we're
not
supposed
to
Did
you
know,
the
Quileute
are
Bella.
I
need
to
see
him.
He's
not
in.
I'm
sorry,
really
need
to
see
him.
What
did
you
do?
Okay,
what
did
you
do?
What
did
you
do
to
him?
He
didn't
want
this!
What
did
he
do?
What
did
he
tell
you?
Nothing!
He
told
me
nothing,
Too
late,
now.
Paul,
calm
down
now.
Bella!
Run!
Jake,
run!
Take
Bella
back
to
Emily's
place.
Guess
the
wolf's
out
of
the
bag.
Alice...
Is
it
possible
that
everything
is
true?
The
fairy
tales
and
Is
it
possible
that
there
isn't
anything
Hey,
I
think,
we
should
go
back
I
hope
Paul
gets
some
teeth
in
him.
No
way.
Jake's
a
natural.
I
got
to
fiver
says,
Come
on
in,
Bella.
Speak
for
yourself.
Oh,
hey,
about
Emily...
...don't
stare.
Why
would
I
stare?
You
guys
hungry?
Who's
this?
Bella
Swan.
So,
youre
the
vampire
girl.
So,
you're
the
wolf
girl.
Guess
so.
Well,
I'm
engaged
to
one.
Save
some
for
your
brothers.
And
the
ladies
first.
Muffin?
Leave
it
to
Jake
up
to
find
He
didn't
say
anything
to
me.
Alpha's
orders
get
obeyed
Alright,
check
it
out!
Will
you
just
shut
up?
Damn
it!
I
can't
really
run
with
vampires.
Because
they
are
fast.
Yeah?
Oh,
we
are
faster.
Freaked
out
yet?
You're
not
the
first
monsters,
I
met.
Jake's
right.
Sorry.
So
you're
a
werewolf?
Yeah,
last
time
I
checked.
A
few
lucky
members
of
the
tribe
If
a
bloodsucker
moves
into
town,
Mono?
Yeah,
I
wish.
You
can't
find
a
way
to
stop?
I
mean
it's
wrong.
It's
not
a
life-style
choice,
Bella.
I
was
born
this
way,
You
are
such
a
hypocrite.
What,
I'm
not
the
It's
not
what
you
are.
They
never
hurt
anybody.
You
killed
people,
Jake.
Bella,
we're
not
killing
anyone.
Then,
who
is?
We're
trying
to
protect
The
only
thing
we
do
kill.
Vampires.
Jake,
you
can't...
Don't
worry,
we
can't
touch
your
Unless
they
violate
the
Treaty.
It's
not
what
I'm
saying.
You
can't
kill
vampires,
though.
They
will
kill
you.
We
took
out
that
leech
with
Laurent?
And
his
redhead
girlfriend
is
next.
Vic...
Victoria
is
here?
We
chased
her
all
the
way
to
the
But
she
keeps
coming
back.
We
don't
know
what
she's
after.
Me.
Don't
worry,
She
wont
get
near
you
or
Charlie.
But
you
got
to
be
careful.
She's
fast,
you
don't
know,
You
know,
your
lack
of
confidence
Alright,
I
better
go.
And
you
got
to
go.
I
got
a
vampire
to
kill.
Alice,
I'm
alright.
Until
I'm
alone.
And
lately,
Jacob's
gone,
And
Charlie
is
hunting
Jacob.
And
you're
gone.
And
so
is
Edward.
And
I
just
have
nothing
now.
You
got
something,
Harry?
Nope,
nothing.
But
I
realize
where
I
have
to
go,
What
I
have
to
do
Don't
do
this.
You
wanted
me
to
be
human.
Watch
me.
Please?
For
me?
You
won't
stay
with
me
Bella.
Please.
Breathe!
Breathe!
Come
on,
Bella.
Bella?
Jake.
What
the
hell
were
you
thinking,
huh?
I
just
needed
to
see
something.
Take
her
home.
I'm
goanna
go
help
over
at
Harry's
place.
What
happened
at
Harry's?
Harry
Clearwater
had
a
heart
attack.
Charlie
and
my
Dad
are
at
Harry's
place
Is
he
okay?
Come
on,
I'll
give
you
something
to
dry
Hundred
and
eight
degrees
over
here.
God!
My
hands
are
freezing.
It
must
be
nice,
never
getting
cold.
Its
a
wolf
thing.
Its
a
Jacob
thing.
You're
like,
your
own
sun.
This
is
better.
But...?
You
saw
what
happened
to
Emily.
Sam
got
angry,
...lost
it
for
a
split
second...
...Em
was
standing
too
close.
He
will
never
be
able
What
if
I
get
mad
at
you?
Sometimes...
I
feel
like,
I'm
goanna
disappear.
You
need
not
hear
it
from
me.
But
I
always
will.
I
won't
let
that
happen.
How?
I'll
tell
you
all
the
time.
How
special
you
are.
Thank
you...
...for
everything.
Wait!
There's
a
vampire.
I
can
smell
it.
That's
Carlisle's
car!
Theyre
here.
Bella,
it's
a
trick.
Stop!
You
got
to
come
with
me.
They
won't
hurt
me.
If
a
Cullen
is
back
here,
The
treaty
says
we
can
only
I
can't
protect
you
here.
Youre
about
to
cross
a
line.
Please.
Alice!
Bella?
I'm
sorry,
I
just...
Is...
Is...?
Would
you
like
to
explain
to
me
What?
You
jumped
off
a
cliff.
Why
in
the
hell
would
you
try
I
mean,
what
about
Charlie?
What
about...?
I
was
cliff
jumping.
Recreationally!
It
was
fun.
I
have
never
met
anyone
more
prone
Did
you...
did
you
tell
him?
He
only
calls
once
in
a
few
months.
He
said
he
wants
to
be
alone.
Aw,
what
is
that
That's
probably
me.
Or...
it's
Jacob.
Jacob
who?
Jacob's
kind
of
a
werewolf.
Ugh!
Bella!
Werewolf's
are
not
Speak
for
yourself.
I
had
to
see
if
you
were
safe.
I
thought
you
couldn't
protect
me
here.
Guess,
I
don't
care.
Well,
I'm
not
goanna
hurt
her.
No,
you're
just
a
harmless
Cullen.
We're
talking
about
...who
tried
to
kill
Bella
Victoria?
I
didn't
see
her.
I
didn't
see
you
getting
pulled
out
I
can't
see
past
you
Don't
get
me
upset.
Things
are
goanna
get
very
ugly!
I
will
give
you
a
minute.
You're
going
anywhere,
As
soon
as
you
put
the
dog
out.
Is
he...?
Are
there
others?
How
many
Cullens
are
here
No.
It's
just
Alice.
And
she
can
stay
Are
the
rest
coming
back?
No.
Not
that
I
know
of.
Anything
else?
That's
it.
Well,
if
that's
all,
then
you
better
go
I
have
done
it
again.
I
keep
breaking
my
promise.
We
don't
have
to
do
this
to
each
other.
Yes,
we
do.
Bella...
Stay
with
me
forever.
Swan
Residence.
He's
not
here
right
now.
He's
arranging
a
funeral.
Who
is
that?
What?
Who
was
that?
Jacob,
who
was
that?
Bella,
it's
Edward.
He
thinks
you
are
dead.
Rosalie
told
him,
Why
would
you...?
Why
didn't
you
let
me
speak
to
him?
He
didn't
ask
for
you.
Bella,
he's
going
to
the
Volturi.
He
wants
to
die
too.
He
left
you,
Bella.
But
I'm
not
goanna
let
him
What
about
your
Dad?
I'm
eighteen,
I'm
legally
free
to
go.
Please,
Bella.
Just...
stay
here.
Not
for
Charlie.
For
me...
I
got
to
go.
I'm
begging
you.
Please.
Bye,
Jacob.
Okay.
So
you
made
up
your
mind?
I'm
afraid
your
particular
gifts...
...are
too
valuable
But
if
you're
unhappy
...join
us.
We
would
be
delighted
Won't
you
consider
You
know
what
will
happen
anyway.
Not
without
cause.
Such
a
waste.
I'm
guessing
you
didn't
rent
this
car?
I
figured,
you
wouldn't
be
Not
today.
What?
What
are
you
seeing?
So...?
Show
himself
to
the
humans.
He's
goanna
wait
until
noon,
Alice,
you
got
to
hurry
up.
Why
are
they
all
in
red?
They're
commemorating
the
expulsion
It's
the
perfect
setting.
The
Volturi
will
never
let
him
We
have
5
minutes.
Alice?!
Bella,
you're
the
only
one
If
I
go,
he
will
read
my
thoughts...
...he'll
think
I'm
lying
Where
do
I
go?
Go!
No!
Heaven.
You
have
to
move!
Open
your
eyes,
look
at
me.
You
have
to
move!
Bella?
You're
here.
You're
alive!
Yes.
I
needed
you
to
see
me
once.
You
had
to
know
that
I
was
alive.
I
can
let
you
go
now.
You
never
had
to
let
it
go.
I
just
couldn't
live
in
a
world
But
you
said...
I
had
to
lie
Because
it
doesn't
make
sense
I'm
nothing...
human.
Bella,
you're
everything
to
me.
Everything.
I
won't
be
needing
your
services
Aro
wants
to
speak
with
you
again.
No
rules
were
broken.
Nevertheless,
we
should
take
this
...to
a
more
appropriate
venue.
Fine.
Bella,
why
don't
you
go
enjoy
The
girl
comes
with
us.
Come
on,
guys.
We
wouldn't
want
to
make
a
scene.
We
wouldnt.
Enough!
Jane.
Aro
send
me
to
see
Just
do
as
she
says.
Go
ahead.
Are
you
scared?
Are
you?
No.
Good
afternoon.
Is
she
human?
Does
she
know?
Then
why
would...
She
wants
to
be...
And
so
she
will
be.
Sister,
sent
you
out
to
get
one
And
a
half.
Such
a
clever
girl.
What
a
happy
surprise!
Bella
is
alive
after
all.
Isn't
that
wonderful?
I
love
a
happy
ending.
They
are
so
rare.
"La
Tua
Cantante.
"
Your
blood
appeals
to
you
...it
makes
me
thirsty.
How
can
you
stand
It's
not
without
difficulty.
Aro
can
read
every
thought
With
one
touch.
And
now
you
know
everything.
So,
get
on
with
it.
You're
quite
soul
reader
yourself,
Edward.
Though...
...you
can't
read
Bella's
thoughts.
Fascinating!
I
would
love
to
see
if...
...you
are
an
exception
Would
you
do
me
the
honour?
Interesting.
I
see
nothing.
I
wonder
if...
Let's
see
if
she
is
immune
Shall
we,
Jane?
No!
Stop!
Stop,
please!
Stop!
Just
stop
hurting
him,
please!
Jane?
Master?
Go
ahead,
my
dear.
This
may
hurt
just
a
little.
Remarkable!
She
confounds
us
all.
So,
what
we
do
with
you
now?
You
already
know
She
knows
too
much,
That's
true.
Felix?
Please!
No,
no!
Kill
me...
kill
me.
Not
him.
How
extraordinary.
You
would
give
up
your
life...
...for
someone
like
us.
A
vampire.
A
soulless
monster.
Just
get
away
from
him!
You
don't
know
a
thing...
...about
his
soul.
Maybe
it's
one
or
the
other.
This
is
a
sadness.
If
only
it
be
your
intention
Wait!
Bella
will
be
one
of
us.
I've
seen
it.
I'll
change
her
myself.
Mesmerizing!
To
see,
what
you
have
seen.
Before
it
is
happened.
Your
gifts...
...will
make
for
an
intriguing...
...immortal.
Isabella.
Go
now.
Make
your
preparations.
Let's
be
done
with
this.
Heidi
will
arrive,
any
moment.
Thank
you...
...for
the
visit.
I
would
advise...
...that
you
follow
through
on
your
promise
soon.
Goodbye...
...my
young
friends.
Nice
fishing,
Heidi.
Yes,
they
do
look
rather
juicy.
Save
some
for
me.
This
way,
please.
You're
here.
You
can
sleep.
I'll
still
be
here
Bella,
the
only
reason
...was
because
I
thought
I
needed
you
to
have
a
chance...
...at
a
normal,
happy
life.
It
was
so
easy
for
you
to
leave.
Leaving
you
was
the
hardest
thing
I
swear...
I
will
never
fail
you
again.
I'm
so
sorry.
Charlie's
coming.
You
okay?
Fine.
Dad,
you
don't
have
to
worry.
Yeah,
last
time
you
said
that
I
didn't
see
you
for
three
days.
I'm
really
sorry,
Dad.
Bella,
do
not
ever
do
that
Ever.
And
you're
grounded...
...for
the
rest
of
your
life.
Okay.
I'm
not
technically
breaking
He
did
say,
I
couldn't
take
a
step
I
came
in
through
the
window.
He's
not
going
to
forgive
me
easily.
I
know.
Can
you?
I
hope
you
can
because...
I
honestly
don't
know
Come
here.
Once
Alice
changes
me,
...you
can't
get
rid
of
me.
She
won't
need
to
change
you.
There
are
always
ways
to
keep
No.
No!
You
all
know
what
I
want.
And
I
know,
The
only
thing
I
can
think
of...
...it
to
be
fair
is
to
just
vote.
You
don't
know
what
you
just...
Alice?
I
already
consider
you
my
sister.
Yes!
I
vote,
yes.
It
would
be
nice
to
not
want
to
I'm
sorry.
I'm
really
sorry,
both
of
you,
And
I'm
really
grateful...
...that
you
were
brave
enough
But
this
isn't
a
life
And
I
wish
that
there
had
been
So...
no.
I
vote
hell
yeah!
We
can
pick
a
fight
with
I
already
consider
you,
Yes!
Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
You
know
what
this
means.
...which
leaves
me
no
choice.
I
won't
lose
my
son.
I'll
wait
until
after
graduation...
...to
make
it
easier
on
Charlie.
I
want
you
to
be
the
one
He
wants
to
talk
to
me.
See,
you're
still
alive
for
now.
He
thinks,
it's
me
keeping
you
away.
You
stay
the
hell
out
of
my
head.
Jacob...
...I
know
you
have
But
I
want
to
say
something
to
you
first.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
for
keeping
...I
didnt.
No,
you
didn't.
And
it
wasn't
for
your
benefit,
I'm
still
grateful.
But
I'm
here
now.
And
I'm
not

You're

Jake...

So,

It's

Bella...
Goodbye,
Jacob.
Bella,

here.
Stop!
Stop!
You

hurt
each
other
Jake?
He's
right.
You
shouldn't

one
of
us.
I
can't
do
this
alone.
Then

Just

five
years.
It's
too
long.
Then,

What's
the
condition?
And

forever.
That's
what
I'm
asking.
Marry

Bella.
