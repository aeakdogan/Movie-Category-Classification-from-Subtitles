Marcus.
How
are
you?
Ask
me
in

I
thought
I'd
try...
one
last
time.
You
should
have
stayed
By
signing

be
donating
your
body
You'd...
have
a
second
chance...
through
my
research
You
know
My
brother
and
two
cops
because
of
me.
I'm
not
lookin'
But
I'm
not
the
only
one
Do
you
think
this
permanent?
I'm
not
worried
I'm
worried
about
I'll
sell
it
to
you.
For
what?
A
kiss.
So
that's
what
You
are
doing
something
I'm
guilty.
Just
cut
me
up
That
I
walk
through
the
valley
I
will
fear
no
evil.

This

Command
deems
the
information
should
be
Connor,
there's
no
sign
They're
gone.
Way
too
quiet.
It's
almost
like
What
the
hell's
Whoa!
Olson.
There's
something
else
We
got
what
we
came
for,
The
clock's
ticking.
Spread
out,
I
got
a
big
gap
Why
didn't

You

And
you
tell
them...
I

This
is
crazy.
John
Connor,
Soldier,
you
put
every
man
in
jeopardy
What
the
hell
What
did
we
find
You'll
be
pleased
down
Well,
I
need
to
know,
down
in
that
hole.
What
did
we
find
We
found
the
solution,
that
can
end
this
war,
We
know
the
machines
use
to
communicate.
Our
intel
has
located
under
It
allows
for
direct
control
Skynet's
a
machine,
it
has
an
off-switch.
Does
it
work?
Will
it
work?
Have
we
field-tested
it?
Give
it
to
me.
I'll
test
it.
Connor,
Have
a
nice
one
record.
Alright.
Alright.
Leave
Connor
in
top-side.
Prepare
for
lock-out.
Connor,
The
war
is
over.
Remount
our
offensive
Connor...
These
are
the
codes
Good
luck.
Why
four
days?
A
kill
list
was
intercepted
It
says
everyone
in
this
room
You
are
number
two
Well,
I
don't
know.
Kyle.
Reese.
Barnes...
My
brother...
This
is
tape
number
28.
What's
most
difficult
is
trying
to
decide
and
what
not
to.
Should
I
tell
you
Will
it
affect
to
send
him
back
in
time
knowing
that
And
he'll
be
younger
only
a
teenager,
Kyle.
Person
could
go
crazy
But
if
you
don't
send
Kyle,
you
can
never
be
You
want
Kyle
is
out
there
and
Skynet
What
about
the
signal?
What
do
you
think?
If
it
works,
Yeah.
-
We
have
to
be
careful.
But
we
have
to
try.
Okay.
Alright
then,
something
We
should
try
bring
it
in
for
testing.
Yeah.
What
is
it,
John?
Kill
Kyle
Reese,
No
John
Connor.
Hey!

2018.
What

while
Why
don't
you

Connor

know
why.
Listen,
if
you've
got
a
problem
he's
definitely
the
guy
-
How
far
is
your
base?
And
it's
that
way.
What
are
you
saying?
I
was
telling
him...
It
is
not
true,
They're
gonna
kill
us.
We

Marcus.
For
thou
art
with
me,
thy
rod
and
my
staff,

they
comfort
me.
This
is
the
beginning
of
something
-
The

is
here.
He

Okay,
Let's

Barnes?
The
Devil's
hands

What
is
it?
Though
it
seems
The
heart
is
human,
The
brain
too,

He
done
enough?
One
human
cortex.
-
One
machine.
Who
built
you?
My
name
is
You
think
I
am
human.
No!
No!
God!
Where
were
you
I
was
born...
August
22nd,
1975.
I
know
you.
I
heard
your
voice
-
You're
John
Connor.
You
were
sent
here
Kill
the
leadership.
I
don't
know
Then
why
are
you
here?
Blair
said
you
could
help
me
Now
let
me
down.
If
I
let
you
down...
you'll
kill
everyone
Just
you,
Connor.
'Cause
I
ain't
I
didn't
even
know
your
name
No?
You
and
me...
We've
been
at
war,
since
before
You
tried
killing
my
mother,
You
killed
my
father,
You
will
not
Kyle
Reese

on
a
Transporter,
If
I
wanted
I
would
have
done
him
Where
did
you
You
sent
Mihradi
and
me
He
was
Was
there
I
honestly
don't
know.
They
were
taking
him
-
He
was
the
only
one
left.
"It
was
the
only
one
left."
It
saved
my
life.
Kate,
what's
gonna
Disassembled.
You
mean
killed.
It
may
have
information
I
know
I've
been
shot
at
That's
not
him.
That
machine
saved
you
to
kill
all
of
us.
We're
gonna
be
okay.
For
my
brother.
No!
Connor
wants
What
for?
Like
he's
going
to
tell
me,
Let
me
see
that.
You
want
me
to
tell
Connor
No.
Watch
him.
I
told
you
everything
Skynet
is
ruthless
They
will
use
the
best
part
of
you
and
they
will
have
methods
That
I
can't
And
when
which
just
always
I
love
you.
There's
nothing
on
the
tapes
That
thing
in
there...
I
thought
I
knew
But
that
thing...
That
makes
me
feel
like
I
looked
in
its
eyes,
absolutely
believes,
It
believes
everything
and
it
is
telling
me
If
that
is
true...
The
Command
is
about
and
the
rest
of
those
prisoners
Thank
you.
Come
in!
Wassup?
Get
in!
Kill
them!
Barnes!
She
made
her
choice.
Get
down!
Let's
move.
-
Put
some
light
out
there!
I
have
a
plan.
-
Blair,
you
okay?
-
Get
your
team
back!
Run!
God--
Now
what?
M-My
plan
stopped
Okay.
Do
you
have
I'll
draw
the
fire.
I
got
a
target!
Behind
the
wall.
-
Don't
move.
Down!
Keep
your
head
down!
Keep
your
head
down!
Come
on!
-
You
alright?
There
they
are!
On
the
ground!
Report

Coming
straight
down.
-
Do
not
move!
Who's
there?
Alligator,
this
is
Scarface
5-1,
Contact--
Take
my
gun!
Check
the
river.
You
see
him?
Move!
God!
I'm
going
down!
Fall!
Give
me
your
hand!
They
know
what
you
are,
Enough!
That
gun
ain't
Nobody
shot
you
and
I
see
that
thing
Kyle
Reese...
He's
in
Skynet.
I
can
get
you
in.
How?
Look
at
me.
That's
why
I'm
your
only
hope
I
need
to
find
So
do
you.
Connor!
Make
your
choice.
You
kept
being...
You
tell
me
-
Yeah?
Contact
me
on
that.
Let
me
know
What
are
you?
I
don't
know.
Hey,
Where
is
he
heading?
You
alright?
Any
sign
of
him?
He's
gone.
What'd
you
do?
I
saw
a
man,
How's
your
leg?
I'll
live.
Let
her
go!
Connor.
Command
for
you.
This
is
Connor.
Connor,
Negative.
We
are
not,
We
must
abort
the
attack.
What
are
you
talking
about?
All
our
elements
They
are
in
Then
delay
the
attack.
I
have
a
chance
and
rescue
Give
me
No,
absolutely
not.
This
is
not
the
time
What
you
ask
for,
Skynet
has
Kyle
Reese.
And
that
is
his
fate.
No,
it's
our
fate.
I
have
to
save
him.
The
key
to
the
future,
Without
him,
No!
If
we
stay
the
course,
We
are
all
dead!
As
of
this
moment,
you
are
relieved
You
are
no
longer
I
didn't
catch
Neither
did
I.
This
is
John
Connor.
If
you're
listening
you
are
Listen
carefully.
If
we
attack
tonight,
our
humanity
is
lost.
Command
wants
us
they
want
us
to
make
But
we
are
not
And
if
we
behave
like
them,
in
winning?
Command
is
going
to
ask

will
be
lost.
So,

Marcus...
What

be...
A
man.
The
human
condition
Accept
what
you
That
you
were
made
To
achieve
what
no
another
machine
To
infiltrate,
and
then
bring
that
target
We've
been
at
war
since
before
You
tried
killing
my
mother,
You
kept
being...
You
tell
me
Yeah,
I
will.
Kyle
Reese!
Move!

Kyle
Reese!
Get
to
your
transport.
Kyle
Reese!
You,
move!
In
times
of
desperation,
people
will
believe
And
so,
we
gave
them
A
trick,
the
Resistance
thought
And
they
were
right,
Except
that
it
is
the
Resistance
not
Skynet.
Get
the
attack
through
I
want
our
aircraft
in
the
sky,
Sir,
sir,
we
got
a
bogey
closing
in
Losenko?
We
have
destroyed
Skynet
tracked
We
led
them
Our
best
machines
have
failed,
to
complete
a
mission.
Something
was
missing.
We
had
to
think,
And
so
we
made
you.
We
created
the
perfect
You,
Marcus.
You
did
what
Skynet
You
killed
John
Connor.
Kyle!
Hey!
Don't
fight,
Marcus.
Remember
I
know
what
I
am.
I'm
better
this
way.
You

not
be
given
You
cannot
save
Watch

You

put
it
It's
the
strength
The
difference
There
is
a
storm
A
time
of
hardship
This
battle
but
the
war
against
Skynet's
global
network
remains
strong,
until
all
of
it
is
destroyed.
This
is
John
Connor.
