Life's
not
fair,
is
it?
You
see,
I...
Heh
heh.
And
you
shall
never
see

Adieu.
Didn't
your
mother
tell
you
What
do
you
want?
I'm
here
to
announce
So
you'd
better
have
for
missing
the
ceremony
Oh,
now,
look,
Zazu.
Ha!
You'll
lose
when
the
king
He's
as
mad
as
Oooh.
I
quiver
with
fear!
Now,
Scar,
Help!
-
Scar?
Drop
him.
Impeccable
timing,
Your
Majesty.
Ptoo!
Ugh.
Why,
if
it
isn't
descending
from
on
high
Sarabi
and
I
didn't
see
you
That
was
today?
Ohh,
I
feel
simply
awful!

Must've
slipped
my
mind.
Yes,
well,
as
slippery
as
the
king's
brother...
you
should've
been

SCAR:
until
the
little
hairball
That
hairball
is
my
son...
and
your
future
king.
I
shall
practice
my
curtsy.
Don't
turn
Oh,
no,
Mufasa.
Perhaps
you
shouldn't

Temper,
temper.
I
wouldn't
dream
Pity.
Why
not?
As
far
as
brains
go,
But
when
it
comes
I'm
afraid
of
the
gene
pool.

There's
one
Two
in
mine,
actually,
to
ruin
special
occasions.
What
am
I
going
to
do
with
him?
He'd
make
Zazu!
And
just
think,
you
could
take
him
out






Hmm.

Simba.
Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha!
Dad!
Dad!
Come
on,
Dad,
-
Uhh!

Dad.
Dad.
Your
son
is
awake.
SIMBA:
Dad,
Dad,
Dad...
Before
sunrise,
he's
your
son.
Dad!
Come
on,
Dad.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Dad!

Whoa!
Uhh!
You
promised.
-
OK,
OK.
I'm
up.

MUFASA:
Look,
Simba.
Everything
the
light
touches
SIMBA:
Wow.
MUFASA:
rises
and
falls
like
the
sun.
One
day,
Simba,
the
sun
and
will
rise
-
And
this'll
all
be
mine?
Everything
the
light
touches.
What
about
that
shadowy
place?
That's
beyond
our
borders.
You
must
never
go
there,
Simba.
But
I
thought
a
king
There's
more
to
being
king...
than
getting
your
way
-
There's
more?

MUFASA:
Everything
you
see
in
a
delicate
balance.
As
king,
you
need
and
respect
from
the
crawling
ant
But,
Dad,
Yes,
Simba,
When
we
die,
and
the
antelope
eat
the
grass.
And
so
we
are
all
connected...
in
the
great
circle
of
life.
-
Good
morning,
sire!
Checking
in
Fire
away.
-
What
are
you
doing,
son?
Let
an
old
pro
show
you
Stay
low
to
the
ground.

Yeah,
OK.
Shhh...
Not
a
sound.
Take
it
slow.
One
more
step...
...
then...
Aah!
That's
very
good.
-
Zazu!
Sir!
Now,
this
time...
Sire!
Zazu,
take
Simba
home.
-
Dad,
can't
I
come?

Oh,
young
master,
one
day,
Then
you
can
chase
stupid
poachers
Hey,
Uncle
Scar!
Guess
what?
I
despise
guessing
games.
I'm
gonna
be
king
of
Pride
Rock.
Oh,
goody.
My
dad
just
showed
me
and
I'm
gonna
rule
it
all.
Yes,
well,
forgive
me
Bad
back,
you
know.
Hey,
Uncle
Scar.
what'll
that
make
you?
A
monkey's
uncle.
Ha
ha
ha!
You
have
no
idea.
So,
your
father
showed
you
Everything.
He
didn't
show
you
at
the
northern
border?
Well,
no.
And
he's
absolutely
right.
Only
the
bravest
lions
go
there.
Well,
I'm
brave.
I'm
sorry,
Simba,
Why
not?
Simba,
Simba,
for
the
well-being

Yeah,
right.
All
the
more
reason
An
elephant
graveyard
for
a
young
prince.
Oops!
An
elephant
what?
Whoa!
Oh,
dear,
I've
said
too
much.
Well,
I
suppose
you'd
have
you
being
so
clever
and
all.
Just
do
me
one
favor.
Promise
me
you'll
never
visit
-
No
problem.
You
run
along
now
And
remember,

-
Hey,
Nala.
Come
on.
I
just
heard
Simba!
I'm
kinda
SARABI:
Mom!
Mom,
you're
messing
up
OK,
I'm
clean.
Where
are
we
going?
No,
it's
really
cool.
So,
where
is
Oh.
Around
the
water
hole.
The
water
hole?
What's
so
great
I'll
show
you
when
we
get
there.
Oh.
Mom,
can
I
go
with
Simba?
What
do
you
think,
Sarabi?
Well...
-
Please.
It's
all
right
with
me.
-
All
right!
As
long
as
Zazu
No,
not
Zazu.
ZAZU:
Step
lively.
The
sooner
we
get
the
sooner
we
can
leave.
So,
where
are
we
really
going?
-
An
elephant
graveyard.
Shh!
Zazu.
Right.
So
how
are
we
ZAZU:
Little
seeds
of
romance
Your
parents
what
with
your
-
Being
what?
Affianced.
Meaning...?
One
day,
you
two
are
going
-
Yuck!
I
can't
marry
her.
Yeah,
it'd
be
so
weird.
Sorry
to
bust
your
bubble...
but
you
two
turtledoves
It's
a
tradition
When
I'm
king,
that'll
be
Not
so
long
as
I'm
around.
In
that
case,
you're
fired.
Nice
try.
Well,
he's
the
future
king.
Yeah,
so
you
have
to
Not
yet,
I
don't.
And
with
an
attitude
I'm
afraid
a
pretty
pathetic
king
Heh.
Not
the
way
I
see
it.
*
I'm
gonna
be
*
So
enemies
beware
*
*
Well,
I've
never
seen
*
With
quite
so
little
hair
*

*
I'm
gonna
be
the
main
event
*
*
Like
no
king
was
before
*
*
I'm
brushin'
up
*
I'm
workin'
on
my
roar
*
Thus
far,
Aaaah!
SIMBA:
*
Oh,
I
just
You've
rather
a
long
way
to
go,
if
you
think...
*
No
one
sayin'
"Do
this"*
Now,
when
I
said
that...
*
No
one
sayin',
"Be
there"*
What
I
meant
was...
*
No
one
sayin'
"Stop
that"*
But
what
you
don't
realize...
*
No
one
sayin',
"See
here"*
Now,
see
here!
SIMBA:
*
Free
to
run
around
Well,
that's
definitely
out.
*
Free
to
do
it
all
my
way
*
*
I
think
it's
time
*
Arranged
SIMBA:
*
From
little
hornbills
*
If
this
is
where
*
Count
me
out
*
*
Out
of
service,
*
I
wouldn't
hang
about
*
Aah!
*
This
child
is
getting
SIMBA:
*
Oh,
I
just


*
Everybody,
look
left
*

*
Everybody,
look
right
*
*
Everywhere
you
look,
*
Standing
Not
yet!
CHORUS:
*
Let
every
creature
*
Let's
hear
it
in
the
herd
*
It's
gonna
be
ALL:
*
Oh,
I
just
*
Oh,
I
just
can't
wait
*
Oh,
I
just
can't
wait
*

*
To
be
king

ZAZU,
MUFFLED:
but...
get
off!
Simba?
Nala!

All
right!
It
worked!
-
We
lost
him.
Hey,
genius,
it
was
my
idea.
Yeah,
but
I
pulled
it
off.
-
With
me!
Raar!
-
Ha!
-
Pinned
ya.
Raar!

-
Uhh!

This
is
it.
We
made
it.
-
Whoa.

NALA:
It's
really
creepy
Yeah.
Isn't
it
great?
-
We
could
get
in
big
trouble.
I
wonder
if
its
brains
There's
only
one
way
to
know.
Come
on,
Wrong!
The
only
will
be
to
check
out
of
here.
Oh,
man!
We're
way
beyond
the
boundary
Look.
Banana
Beak
is
scared.
It's
Mr.
Banana
Beak
and
right
now
we
are
all
Danger?
Ha!
I
walk
on
the
wide
side.
I
laugh
in
the
face
Ha
ha
ha
ha!

Huh?

Well,
well,
well,
Banzai,
I
don't
know,
Shenzi.
What
do
you
think,
Ed?

Just
what
I
was
thinkin'.
And
quite
by
accident,
A
simple
navigational
error.
Whoa,
whoa,
wait,
wait,
wait.
I
know
you.
I,
madam,
-
And
that
would
make
you...
Do
you
know
what
we
do
to
kings

Heh
heh.
We
are
on
their
land.
But,
Zazu,
you
told
me
but
slobbering,
mangy,
Lx-nay
on
the
upid-stay.
Who
are
you
callin'
upid-stay?
My,
my,
my.
Look
at
the
sun!
What's
the
hurry?
We'd
love
you
to
stick
Yeah,
we
could
have
Wait,
wait,
wait,
Make
mine
a
cub
sandwich!


What,
Ed?
What
is
it?
Hey,
did
we
order
No,
why?
BANZAI:


NALA:
Did
we
lose
'em?
SIMBA:
I
think
so.
The
little
major-domo
bird
all
the
way
Oh,
no!
Aaaah!

Hey,
why
don't
you
pick
on
-
Like
you?

ALL:
Boo!



Aah!
SIMBA:
Aaah!
Uhh!

NALA:
Simba!
Aah!

Rraar...
Uhh!


-
Uhh!
Here,
kitty,
kitty,
kitty.
Rraar!
Rraar!
Rraar!
Heh!
That
was
it?

Do
it
again.
Come
on.

ALL:
Huh?

Oh,
please,
please!
-
Silence!
Calm
down.
If
you
ever
come
Oh,
this
is
your
son?
-
Oh,
your
son?
No.
Me?
I
didn't
know...
-
No,
of
course
not.
-
Ed?


Heh
heh.
Toodles.

Dad,
l...
You
deliberately
disobeyed
me.
Dad,
I'm
sorry.
Let's
go
home.
I
thought
you
were
very
brave.

MUFASA:
Zazu.
-
Yes,
sire?
I've
got
to
teach
Come,
Nala.
Simba...

Good
luck.
Simba!


Simba,
-
I
know.
You
deliberately
and
what's
worse,
I
was
just
trying
to
be
brave,
I'm
only
brave
Simba,
being
brave...
doesn't
mean
But
you're
not
scared
I
was
today.
-
You
were?
I
thought
I
might
lose
you.
Oh.
I
guess
even
Mm-hmm.
-
But
you
know
what?
I
think
those
hyenas

'Cause
nobody
-
Come
here,
you.
Aah!
Rrr!
Uhh!
Aah!
Come
here!

Gotcha!

-
Dad?
We're
pals,
right?
Heh
heh.
Right.
And
we'll
always
Simba,
let
me
that
my
father
told
me.
Look
at
the
stars.
The
great
kings
look
down
on
us
-
Really?
So,
whenever
just
remember
will
always
be
there
and
so
will
I.
BANZAI:
I
won't
be
able

It's
not
funny,
Ed.

Hey,
shut
up!



Will
you
knock
it
off?

SHENZI:
Look
at
you
guys.
at
the
bottom
Man,
I
hate
dangling.
Yeah?
You
know,
we'd
be
runnin'
the
joint.
Man,
I
hate
lions.
-
So
pushy.
-
And
stinky.
BOTH:
U-u-u-ugly!

SCAR:
Oh,
surely,
-
Ohh.
We
were
afraid
Yeah,
you
know,
like
Mufasa.
-
Yeah.
-
Now,
that's
power.
I
just
hear
that
name
-
Mufasa!
-
Mufasa!
Mufasa!
Mufasa!
Mufasa!

SHENZI:
Ooh,
it
tingles.
I'm
surrounded
by
idiots.
Now,
you,
Scar,
You're
our
pal.
Charmed.
Oh,
I
like
that.
He's
not
king,
Did
you
bring
us
anything
Did
ya,
did
ya,
did
ya?
I
don't
think
you
I
practically
gift-wrapped
and
you
couldn't


it
wasn't
exactly
like
Yeah.
What
were
we
kill
Mufasa?

Precisely.
Huh?



*
I
know
that
your
powers
*
Are
as
wet
*
But
thick
as
you
are
*
*
Pay
attention
*
*
My
words
*
It's
clear
from
*
The
lights
*
But
we're
talking
kings
*
Even
you
can't
be
-
Oh!
*
So
prepare
for
*
Be
prepared
*
A
shiny
new
era
*
And
where
do
we
feature?
*
*
Just
listen
to
teacher
*
*
I
know
it
sounds
sordid
*
*
But
you'll
be
rewarded
*
*
When
at
last
*
And
injustice
*
Be
prepared
*
Yeah,
be
prepared.
We'll
be
prepared.
For
what?
For
the
death
of
the
king.
Why,
is
he
sick?
No,
fool,
and
Simba,
too.
Great
idea.
*
No
king,
no
king,
Idiots!
-
Hey,
but
you
said...
Stick
with
me,
and
you'll
-
Yeah!
All
right!
ALL:
Long
live
the
king!
Long
live
the
king!
*
King,
king,
king,
*
It's
great
that
*
With
a
king
who'll
be
*
Of
course,
*
You're
expected
*
*
To
take
certain
duties
*
The
future
*
And
though
*
The
point
that
*
You
won't
get
a
sniff
Aah!
*
So
prepare
for
*
Be
prepared
*
La
la

*
*
Meticulous
planning

Tenacity
spanning

Decades
of
denial

Is
simply
why

Respected,
saluted

And

Yes,
my
teeth

Be
prepared

Yes,
our
teeth

Be
prepared

SCAR:
Now,
you
wait
here.
Your
father
has
Ooh,
what
is
it?
If
I
told
you,
If
you
tell
me,
Ho
ho
ho!
Come
on,
Uncle
Scar.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This
is
just
You
know,
a
sort
of
Well,
I
better
go
get
him.
-
I'll
go
with
you.
No.
Just
stay
on
this
rock.
You
wouldn't
want
to
end
up
like
you
did
with
the
hyenas.
You
know
about
that?
Simba,
-
Really?
Lucky
Daddy
was
there
Oh,
and
just
between
us...
you
might
want
to
work
on
Oh,
OK.
Hey,
Uncle
Scar,
Simba,
it's
to
die
for.


-
Shut
up.
I'm
so
hungry.
Stay
put.
Can't
I
just
pick
off
No.
We
wait
for
the
signal
There
he
is.
Let's
go.
Little
roar.
Puhh.
Rarr!
Rrrarr!
Rarr!








Oh,
look,
sire,
-
Odd.
Stampede
in
the
gorge.
-
Simba's
down
there.
Oh!

Zazu,
help
me!
Your
father
is
on
the
way!
Hurry!
There,
on
that
tree.
Hold
on,
Simba!

Aah!
Uhh!
Oh,
Scar,
this
is
awful!
Ha!
I'll
go
back
to
help,
I'll
go
back...
Oof!

Uhh!


Aah!
-
Uhh!


-
Rraar!

MUFASA:
Scar!
Uhh!
Brother!
Help
me!

Long
live
the
king.

-
Aah!



Dad!

Dad?

Dad?
Dad,
come
on.
You
got
to
get
up.
Dad?
We
got
to
go
home.

Help!
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.


SCAR:
Simba.
What
have
you
done?
There
were
wildebeests,
It
was
an
accident.
Of
course,
of
course
No
one
ever
means
but
the
king
is
dead.
And
if
it
weren't
for
you,
What
will
your
mother
think?

Run
away,
Simba.
Run.
Kill
him.


Huh?




Unh!
Uhh!
Uhh!

Uhh!
Whoa!

-
Ooh!
Yow!

Aah!
Ohh!
Yeow!
Hey,
there
he
goes.
So,
go
get
him.
There
ain't
no
way
You
want
me
to
come
out

But
we
got
to
finish
the
job.
Well,
he's
as
good
as
dead
And
if
he
comes
back,
Yeah!
You
hear
that?
If
you
ever
come
back,

Mufasa's
death
but
to
lose
Simba,

For
me,
So,
it
is
that
I
assume
the
throne.
Yet
out
of
the
ashes
we
shall
rise
to
greet
in
which
lion
and
hyena
in
a
great

Ohh,
ho
ho.


BOTH:
Yaah!
Get
out!
Get
out!
I
love
this!
Hee
hee
hee!
Ha
ha
ha!
Uh-oh.
Hey,
Timon,
I
think
it's
still
alive.
Eee.
All
righty,


Jeez,
it's
a
lion!
Hey,
Timon,
Look
at
him.
-
Can
we
keep
him?
You're
talking
about
a
lion.
-
But
he's
so
little.
Maybe
he'll
be
on
our
side.
Ha!
That's
the
stupidest
Maybe
he'll...
Hey,
I
got
it.
What
if
he's
on
our
side?
Having
a
lion
around
So,
we're
keeping
him?
Pbbt!
Of
course.
-
Uh...
Jeez,
I'm
fried.
Let's
get
out
of
here
Mmm.
Uhh.
-
You
OK,
kid?
-
You
nearly
died.
Well,
Pumbaa
helped...
a
little.
Thanks
for
your
help.
-
Hey,
where
you
going?
Gee,
he
looks
blue.
TIMON:
No,
no,
no.
Oh.
Kid,
what's
eating
you?
Nothing.
He's
at
Ah
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha!
The
food
chain!
Ha
ha.
Ahem.
So,
where
you
from?
Who
cares?
Ah,
you're
an
outcast.
That's
great.
So
are
we.
What'd
you
do,
kid?
Something
terrible...
but
I
don't
want
Good.
We
don't
want
Come
on,
Timon.
Not
unless
Kid,
in
times
like
this,
you
got
to
put
No,
no,
no.
Amateur.
Lie
down
You
got
to
put
your
past
Look,
kid,
and
you
can't
do
anything
-
Right.
When
the
world
you
turn
your
back
on
the
world.
That's
not
what
I
was
taught.
Then
maybe
Repeat
after
me.
Ahem.

am

Yes,
sire,
you
are
the
king.
I
only
mentioned
it
in
your
royal
BANZAI:
Hey,
boss.
What
is
it
this
time?
-
We
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
you.
Scar,
there's
no
food,
no
water.
Yeah.
It's
dinnertime...
and
we
ain't

It's
the
lioness's
job
Yeah,
but
they
won't
go

Oh,
eat

Oh,
you

I'd
be

tough

Oh,
Zazu,
All
you
need
is
a

dung.
I
thought
things
-
What
did
you
say?
Unh!
I
said...
Que
pasa?
Good.
Now
get
out.
-
But
we're
still
hungry.


Whoa.
Nice
one,
Simba.
Thanks.
Man,
I'm
stuffed.
Me,
too.
I
ate
like
a
pig.
Pumbaa,
you
are
a
pig.
Oh.
Right.



-
Timon?
Ever
wonder
what
those
TIMON:
Pumbaa,
PUMBAA:
Oh?
What
are
they?
They're
fireflies...
fireflies
that
got
stuck
in
Oh,
gee.
I
always
thought
burning
billions
of
miles
away.
TIMON:
Pumbaa,
with
you,
Simba,
what
do
you
think?
Well,
I
don't
know.
Oh,
come
on.
-
Nah.
Well,
somebody
once
told
me...
that
the
great
kings
of
the
past
watching
over
us.
Really?
A
bunch
of
royal
dead
guys

TIMON:
Who
told
you
Yeah,
yeah.
What
mook
made
that
up?
Yeah,
pretty
dumb,
huh?
-
Aw,
you're
killing
me.
TIMON:
Whoo.
Ohh.
Was
it
something
I
said?



Hmm.





Hmm.
Simba?
He's
alive?
He's
alive!


It
is
time.

Aah!



Pumbaa?

Pumbaa!
Pumbaa!
Pumbaa,
Pumbaa!
She's
going
to
eat
me!
TIMON:
Huh?
Whoa!
Jeez,
why
do
I
always
Aah!

Don't
worry,
buddy.
Everything's
going
to
be
OK.
Get
her!
Bite
her
head!
Go
for
the
jugular!
See,
I
told
you


Nala?
Is
it
really
you?
Who
are
you?
It's
me...
Simba.
Simba?
-
Whoa!
-
But
how
did
you...
Where
did
you
come
from?
It's
great
to
see
you!
Hey,
what's
goin'
on
here?
What
are
you
doing
here?
NALA:
What
are
you
doing
here?
Hey!
What's
goin'
on
here?!
Timon,
this
is
Nala.
-
Friend?
Hey,
Pumbaa,
come
over
here.
Huh?
Nala,
this
is
Pumbaa.
Pleased
to
make
The
pleasure's
all
mine.
TIMON:
How
do
you
do?
Let
me
get
this
straight.
But
she
wants
to
eat
him,
-
Did
I
miss
something?!
Wait
till
everyone
finds
out
And
your
mother...
She
doesn't
have
to
know.
Nobody
has
to
know.
Of
course
they
do.
They
do?
Yeah.
Scar
told
us
He
did?
What
else
matters?
you're
the
king.
King?

Lady,
have
you
got
King?
Your
Majesty...
I
gravel
at
your
feet.
Stop
it.
It's
not
"gravel,"
And
don't!
-
Are
you?
-
Simba!
Maybe
I
was
gonna
be,
Let
me
get
this
straight.
You're
the
king?
Look,
I'm
still
the
same
guy.
But
with
power.
Could
you
guys
excuse
us
Whatever
she
has
to
say...
she
can
say
in
front
of
us,
Mmm...
maybe
you'd
better
go.
It
starts.

Timon
and
Pumbaa...
What?
What
is
it?
It's
like
you're
back
You
don't
know
how
much
what
it
means
to
me.
Hey,
it's
OK.
I've
really
missed
you.
I've
missed
you,
too.

I
tell
you,
Pumbaa.
Oh,
sorry.
Not
you,
them!
Him,
her,
alone.
What's
wrong
with
that?
*
I
can
see
What?!
*
And
they
don't
have
a
clue
*
Who?!
*
They'll
fall
in
love
*
*
And
here's
the
bottom
line
*
*
Our
trio's
down
to
two

Oh.

There's

In
perfect

With
all
SIMBA:
*
So
many
things
*
But
how
to
make
her
see
*
*
The
truth
about
my
past?
*
*
Impossible,
NALA:
*
He's
holding
back
*
*
He's
hiding
*
*
But
what,
I
can't
decide
*
*
Why
won't
he
be
the
king
*
The
king
I
see
inside

CHORUS:

Can
you

The

needn't
look

far

Stealing
through

The
night's
uncertainties

Love
is
where
they
are

And
if
he
falls
*

In
love
tonight
*

*
It
can
be
assumed
*
*
His
carefree
days
*
*
With
us
are
history
*
*
In
short,
our
pal
*
*
Is
doomed

SIMBA:
NALA:
It
is
beautiful...
but
I
don't
understand
You've
been
alive
all
this
time.
Why
didn't
you
come
back
Well,
I
just
needed
live
my
own
life.
And
I
did,
and
it's
great.
We've
really
needed
you
at
home.
No
one
needs
me.
Yes,
we
do.
Nala,
we've
been
through
this.
I'm
not
the
king.
Scar
is.
Simba,
he
let
the
hyenas
-
What?
There's
no
food,
no
water.
Simba,
if
you
don't
everyone
will
starve.
-
I
can't
go
back.
-
You
wouldn't
understand.
No,
it
doesn't
matter.
-
What?
It's
something
Look,
sometimes
Simba...
And
there's
nothing
so
why
worry?
Because
it's
Well,
what
about
you?
I
left
to
find
help,
Don't
you
understand?
Sorry.
What's
happened
to
you?
You're
right.
I'm
not.
No,
just
disappointed.
You're
starting
Good.
Listen,
you
think
and
tell
me
You
don't
even
know
I
would,
-
Forget
it!
She's
wrong.
I
can't
go
back.
What
would
it
prove,
anyway?
You
can't
change
the
past.
You
said
you'd
always
But
you're
not.
And
it's
because
of
me.
It's
my
fault.
It's
my
fault.

Shh.

You
knew

Correction...
I
hate
to
tell
you
this...
but
he
died
a
long
time
ago.
Nope.
Wrong
again!
Ha
ha
ha!
He's
alive,
You
follow
old
Rafiki.

Don't
dawdle.
Hurry
up!
Hey,
whoa,
wait,
wait.
Come
on.
Come
on!
Would
you
slow
down?
Uhh!
Uhh!

Stop!
Shh.
Look
down
there.

That's
not
my
father.
That's
just
my
reflection.
No.
Look
harder.
RAFIKI:
You
see?
He
lives
in
you.
MUFASA,
ECHOING:
Simba.
Father?

Simba,
you
have
forgotten
me.
No.
How
could
I?
You
have
forgotten
and
so
have
forgotten
me.
Look
inside
yourself,
Simba.
You
are
more
You
must
take
your
place
How
can
I
go
back?
I'm
not
who
I
used
to
be.
Remember
who
you
are.
You
are
my
son,
Remember
who
you
are.
No!
Please,
don't
leave
me!
MUFASA:
Remember.
-
Father!
Don't
leave
me.
MUFASA:
Remember.


RAFIKI:
The
weather...
Pbbah!
Very
peculiar,
Yeah.
Looks
like
the
winds
Ahh,
change
is
good.
Yeah,
but
it's
not
easy.
I
know
what
I
have
to
do...
but
going
back
means
I've
been
running
from
it

Ow!
Jeez!
What
was
that
for?
It
doesn't
matter.
Yeah,
but
it
still
hurts.
Oh,
yes,
the
past
can
hurt.
But
the
way
I
see
it,
or
learn
from
it.

Aah!
You
see?
First,
I'm
gonna
take
No,
no,
no,
no!
Hey!
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
going
back!
Good!
Go
on!

Whoo!
Ha
ha
ha!
Whoooo!
Whoooo!




Grubs!
Grubs!

Hey.
Hey,
wake
up.

It's
OK!
Whoa,
whoa!

Carnivores...
Oy!
Have
you
guys
seen
Simba?
I
thought
he
was
with
you.
He
was,
-
Where
is
he?
You
won't
find
him
here!
Ha
ha!
I
can't
believe
it.
Gone
back?
What
do
you
mean?
Hey,
what's
goin'
on
here?
Who's
the
monkey?
Simba's
gone
back
-
Who?
-
Who's
got
a
scar?
-
The
monkey's
his
uncle?
Simba's
gone
back
to
take
his
place
as
king.
BOTH:
Oh.



NALA:
Simba,
wait
up!
It's
awful,
isn't
it?
SIMBA:
I
didn't
want
What
made
you
come
back?
I
finally
got
some
sense
and
I've
got
the
bump
Besides,
this
is
my
kingdom.
If
I
don't
fight
for
it,
-
I
will.
Danger?
Ha!
I
laugh
in
the
face
of
danger.
I
see
nothing
funny
about
this.
Timon,
Pumbaa,
At
your
service,
my
liege.
We're
gonna
fight
Yes,
Timon.
Talk
about
your
fixer-upper.
Well,
Simba,
we're
with
you
to
the
end.


Hyenas.
I
hate
hyenas.
So,
what's
your
plan
-
Live
bait.
Come
on,
Timon.
You
guys
What
do

The
choice

Either
step

not
true.
It's
true.
You

It's
your

murderer.
