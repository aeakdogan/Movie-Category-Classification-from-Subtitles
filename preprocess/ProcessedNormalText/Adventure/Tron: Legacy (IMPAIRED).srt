CASTOR:
Zuse

the
earliest
days
By
necessity,
All
the

So
when
do
l
meet
him?
You
just
did.
After
the
Purge,
Self-preservation,
you
understand.
Now,
what
can
l
do
for
you?
l

to
get
to
the

Well,
it's

the

you

But
first,
as
a
man

himself

ask
who

you
my

Her
name's
Quorra.

she

you
a
long
time
ago.
indeed
she
did.
Many
cycles
ago.
it
was
a
different
time.
But
we're
not
here
to
relive
the
past.
We'll
have
to
change
your
attire
and
you'll
need
a
forged
disk.
And
of
course
you'll
need
transport
to
cross
the
Sea
of

This
is
going
to
be
quite
the
ride.

The

of

He's
fantastic!
Behold!
The

of
our

Yeah!
Yeah,
yeah!
Yeah,
yeah!
Go,
go!
Let's
split,
man.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
A
little

here
maybe?
SAM:
Your

Dad,
it's
gone.
it

l'm
sorry.

We
can
go
back.
-l

-Dad,
l

do
this.
Sam,
you're
really...
You're
messing
with
my
Zen
thing,

She's
stable.
-SAM:
So
what
do
we
do
now?
We
do
nothing.
Be
still.
Wait.
You
ever
jump
a
freight
train?
Huh?
We
do
it
your
way.
lf
we

Clu

we

a
chance.
Let's

Kevin:

our

Yeah.
Check
that
out.
She
risked
herself
for

Some
things
are
worth
the
risk.
Kevin:
Look
at
this.
Now,
that
is
impressive
Come
on,
it's

Now

for

to

me
a
story.

The

gone.

Your
Excellency,
You

Find
them.

getting
richer,
Cell

-Kevin:
What's
Wi-Fi?
-Of
digital

Hmm.
l

of
that
in
'85.
Mom
and
Dad
are...
-l

that...
Oh.

when

and
Gram
five
years
later.
You

that
night

show
you
the

You

have

this
place
l
couldn't
wait
to
show
it
to
you.
SAM:

have
been
something
No,
no,
he...
He's
me.
l
screwed
it
up.
Chasing
after
perfection.
Chasing
after
Right
in

of
me.
Look
what
you've
accomplished.
its
incredible.
Sam,

have

it
all
up
Hey.
Remember
your
old
Ducati?
You
kidding?
Not
a
day

by
-Yeah,
well,
l'm
fixing
her
up.
Twenty
years
in
the
shed,
no
tarp.
How
does
she
run?
Well,
when
l'm
done,
better
than
ever.
Well,
man,
l'd
like
to
see
that.
You
will.
Here.
She's
rebooting.
Give
her
this.
The
old

goanna
knock
on
the
sky,
CASTOR:
When
Flynn
ah,
everything
changed.
l've
never
seen
anything
quite
like
it.
The
awe
was
palpable.
-Was
it?
our
understanding
is
still
valid?
Control
of
the
city?
A
sizeable
request,
l
know.
But
seemingly
fitting
compensation.
Don't
you
think?
How
long
have
you
been
About
1
,000
cycles.
No?
Just
imagine
the
secrets
it
holds.
The
master
key
to
any
and
all
riddles
of
the
Grid,
Grid,
Grid,
Grid...
But
there's
something
else,
too.
isnt
there?
l've
heard
the
chatter
about
this
private
initiative.
l
realize
that
our
alliance
is,
at
times,
uneasy.
But
always
necessary.
You
know
you
need
me
right
where
l
am.
Clu?
Of
course
you're
right.
Enjoy
the
drink.
End
of

man.
-Hey.
its
okay.
We're
safe
for
now.
We're
heading
east
towards
the

Clu
has
the
disk.
Once
l
get
out,
l
can
shut
him
down.
l
should
never
have
sent
you
to
Zuse.
its
okay.
l've
made
a
few
myself.
Where
is
he?
SAM:
l
think
he's
knocking
on
the
sky.
QUORRA:
And
listening
to
the
sound.
Yeah.
How
did
you
find
him?
its
okay.
l
know.
QUORRA:
it
was
during
the
Purge.
Clu
was
relentless.
The
Black
Guard
were
executing
lSOs
Everyone
l
knew
disappeared.
Then
they
came
for
me.
So
l
ran.
A
sympathetic
program
But
soon
they
had
me
surrounded.
l
prepared
for
the
end.
And
just
as
everything
was
going
dark,
l
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder.
And
when
l
opened
my
eyes,
standing
above
me
was
the
Creator.
Your
father.
He
saved
me.
l
guess
you
could
say
l'm
a
rescue.
SAM:
Hell
of
a
view.
QUORRA:
it
used
to
let
us
know
it
became
the
symbol
something
better
than
this
world.
l've
never
been
this
close
before.
its
how
l
imagine
a
sunrise
to
be.
Ah,
trust
me.
There's
no
comparison.
What's
it
like?
-The
sun?
Man...
l've
never
had
to
describe
it
before.
Warm.
Radiant.
Beautiful.
Get
below!
Move!
This
isn't
supposed
to
be
here.
-What
happened?
What
is
this?
Clu
can't
create
programs.
He
can
only
destroy
or
repurpose
them.
Repurpose
them
for
what?

Yes!
To

He's

it.
