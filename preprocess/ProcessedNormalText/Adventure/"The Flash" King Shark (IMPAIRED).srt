Just

me
help,

Grab
a
marker.

Yeah.
Hardest
part
was
amping
the
torque
without
increasing
drag.
A
heavier
engine
would
but
this
streamlined
both
the
torque
and
the
horsepower.
Yeah,

just
worried

let's
do
this...
use

one-to-one
transfer
gearbox
to
drop
the
output
shaft
of
the
engine,
reverse
rotation
and
send

to

I
found
something
Sharks
are
predators.
In
order
to
track
their
prey,
they
use
what's
known
as
passive
electrolocation.
Passive
electrolocation?
Yes,
it's
how
they
sense
around
a
fish's
body.
King
Shark
senses
Okay,
that
explains
how
but
how
is
that
going
We
flip
it.
Instead
of
King
Shark
being
the
predator,
we
make
him
the
prey,
and
track
him
using
We
reprogram
our
satellite
to
generate
a
specific
electric
field
and
then
measure
any
electrical
distortions
that
correlate
with
a
1-ton
walking
shark.

That'll
help
us
get
him.
You
help
me
out?
Sure.
Great.
Let
us
know
when
you
locate
him
Okay.
