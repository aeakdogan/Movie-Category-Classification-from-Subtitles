So
how
deep
are
we?
when
you
quit
askin'
me
these
questions
-
What
is
our
current
depth?
I'll
decide
what's
important.
You've
had
two
and
a
half
hours.
We're
at
57

We're
not
lookin'
too
good
right
now.
We
gotta
get
that
radio
back
up.

Mr.
President,
We
can
remote
detonate
the
bomb
-

Yes,
we
saw
that
too,
sir.
But
maybe
we
should
wait
until
they...
Dan,
get
them
out
of
there.

Evac
right
now.
I've
been
ordered

Well,

radio.
Gruber,
give
me
everything
you
got
now!
Yes,
Mr.
President,
I
understand
that
And
I
think
you
need
to
trust
me
on
this
I
guarantee
you,
Yes,
sir.
General,
he
wants
you.
This
is
Kimsey.
Yes,
sir.
I
understand.
The

God!
Sharp!
What?
Get
the
shuttle
ready
to
evac
now!

came
on
all
by
itself.
What
the
hell's
happening?
-
What's
that?
What?
-
What
does
that
mean?
-
They're
detonating
this
thing
from
Earth.

We
haven't
even
drilled
the
hole
yet!
-
What're
you
talkin'
about?
-
The
hole?

leavin'
without
my
men,
Sharp.
We've
got
two
and
a
half
minutes
If
they're
not
back
by
the
time
Okay,
let's
simplify
this.
If
we
don't
put
this
bomb
down
all
you're
gonna
have
is
This
is
turnin'
into
Watsler,
are
you
listening?
It's
Truman.
Okay,
listen
to
me
carefully.

Give
us
the
time,
Sharp.
Shut

Then
whose
call
is
it?
-
The
president's
not
here!
You've
gotta
give
us
more
time!
I'm
telling
you
-
And
I'm
telling
you
it's
not
my
call!
-
I
just
made
the
call
for
you.
Don't.
You
could
set
it
off.
Oh,
man.
What're
you
doin'
Come
on.
Come
on.
We
gotta
stop
-
This
thing
is
gonna
blow.
We
