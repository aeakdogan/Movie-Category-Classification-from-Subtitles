Directed
by
In
the
early
16th
Century,
Japan
and
the
farmers
everywhere
under
the
iron
heels
Let's
take
this
village
too!
Wait!
We
looted
rice
here
last
fall
I'm
afraid
they
have
nothing
yet
Let's
come
back
after
Is
there
no
god
to
protect
us?
Land-tax!
Forced
labor!
War!
Drought!
Then,
the
bandits!
God
must
want
us
farmers
to
starve!
That's
true,
better
we
die
Stop
complaining!
That
won't
help!
Let's
go
see
the
Magistrate!
Let's
appeal
to
him!
What's
the
use?
He'd
come
only
after
Let's
give
everything
to
the
bandits!
And
then
hang
ourselves!
That
might
get
some
action
Let's
make
bamboo
spears
Let's
kill
the
bandits,
They
won't
come
back
again,
I
don't
like
this
idea
That's
an
impossibility!
You
kill
samurai
on
the
run-
Stop
it!
No
time
for
quarrelling!
We
haven't
a
chance
against
them!
What
would
happen
if
we
were
They
kill
even
babies
in
the
womb!
Enough!
Better
to
kill
or
be
killed,
Farmers
are
born
to
suffer
That's
our
lot
Let's
greet
them
meekly
Give
up
our
crops
Just
beg
them
to
leave
something
On
our
knees
let's
beg
them,
You
think
they'll
listen?
You've
forgotten?
Rice
we're
eating,
how...
Let's
go
see
the
Grandad!
And
ask
his
advice!
Negotiate
with
them.
Depend
on
They're
worse
than
wolves.
Next
they
ask
for
your
arms!
They
know
no
limit
They'd
come
again
in
the
fall!
But
if
we
lose...
Huh?
So
we
lose!
Without
the
crop,
we'll
die,
anyway
We'll
fight!
That's
too
reckless!
We're
farmers.
We'll
hire
samurai!
Hire
samurai?
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
When
your
native
village
was
burned
As
I
was
escaping
to
this
village,
one
village
unburned.
But
Grandad,
there
are
many
We're
eating
gruel.
We
could
eat
millet!
But
will
samurai
fight
for
us,
They're
awfully
proud!
Find
hungry
samurai!
Even
bears
come
out
of
the
forests,
What
insolence!
Poor
as
I
am,
I'm
no
beggar!
Fool!
I
warned
you
It
has
ripened
Of
course.
What
shall
we
do?
This
is
an
early
kind.
I'm
soaked
to
the
bones!
Found
any
samurai,
cheap,
Some
leftovers.
That's
a
laugh!
What's
so
funny?
He's
blind!
How
about
you?
No,
thanks
I'd
rather
eat
horse
dung
He's
broke!
I
cleaned
him
out
last
night
He
drew
his
sword
He's
dead
broke
They
only
eat
millet
Is
that
true?
Eat
right
or
you'll
become
You
can
have
them
You
and
everybody
else
What
a
waste
it
was!
With
that
rice
we
could
Stop
it!
Am
I
not
right?
The
suckers
are
mad!
What
a
waste!
What
foolishness!
He
ate
plenty
He
drank
plenty
Then
he
beat
me
up
and
left
A
smart
samurai!
How
different
from
the
one
Let's
get
out
of
here!
He's
crying!
He
misses
his
wife!
I
would
pay
plenty
to
see
them
love!
Let's
go
home!
Please!
Go
home!
How
can
you
hire
samurai,
Besides,
we
don't
know
anything
As
much
as
we
know
about
seeds
The
strong
ones
Any
who
seem
to
be
willing
I
was
defeated
last
night
Liar!
You
had
money
to
gamble
away!
Want
more
trouble?
There's
a
fight!
This
way,
this
way!
Stop
it!
It's
depressing!
Play
on!
Play
loud!
We
back
you!
You
want
to
go
home!
But
I
could
never
What
else
can
we
do?
You
have
to
deal
with
the
bandits!
All
right!
I
see!
But
-
What
will
you
offer
them
this
time?
Your
daughter?
She's
very
pretty!
It
may
work!
What's
happening?
A
thief
is
in
that
barn!
He
was
discovered
How
many
thieves?
Just
one
One?
What's
holding
you
back?
But
we're
helpless
He
kidnapped
a
child
Says
he'll
kill
him
if
we
attack!
Listen!
Hear
that?
Poor
kid!
They've
been
in
there
since
His
voice
has
gotten
hoarse!
He's
seven
His
poor
parents!
But
what's
wrong
with
that
samurai?
A
mystery
He's
promised
to
save
the
boy.
Then
he
began
shaving
I
don't
understand!
This
is
a
priest
I'm
a
priest!
I'm
not
after
you!
Don't
worry
The
boy
must
be
starved
Don't
come
in!
I
brought
food
For
you,
too!
Take
it!
What's
the
matter?
Throw
it
in!
No
complaints
Hurry.
What
is
it?
My
name
is
Katsushiro
Okamoto
Make
me
your
disciple!
Disciple?
My
name
is
Kimbei
Shimada.
And
I
have
no
disciples
Rise.
We
can
talk
Please!
Take
me
as
your
disciple!
Rise!
Let's
talk
as
we
walk
You
embarrass
me
You're
overestimating
me
Listen
I'm
not
a
man
But
I've
had
plenty
of
experience
losing
battles,
all
of
them
In
short,
that's
all
I
am
Drop
such
an
idea
No,
sir.
I'll
follow
you,
sir
I
forbid
it
I
can't
afford
to
take
What
do
you
want?
What
do
you
want?
You
are
rude!
Mind
your
own
business,
kid!
Are
you
a
samurai?
Sure!
I
wonder
Who
is
he?
Pay
no
attention
Please,
sir!
I
fever
to
ask!
Why
don't
you
go
home?
Haven't
you
had
enough
yet?
It's
impossible
Sir!
Why
not
arm
them
with...?
I
thought
of
that,
too
But
sir
This
would
not
be
a
game
A
band
of
forty
bandits!
Two
or
three
samurai
Defense
is
harder
than
offense
Mountains
in
back
of
the
village?
Can
horses
get
over
them?
Fields
in
front
The
village
is
wide
open
until
the
fields
are
flooded
One
guard
for
each
Two
more
as
a
reserve
You'll
need
at
least
seven,
We
can
afford
seven,
eh?
The
Grandad
said
"four,"
But
three
more
Wait!
I
haven't
said
"Yes!"
I'm
only
thinking
In
the
first
place,
it's
not
easy
Especially
when
the
total
reward
And
the
fun
of
it,
Besides...
I'm
tired
of
fighting
Maybe
it's
my
age
I'm
glad
I
wasn't
A
dog
is
luckier!
Shit!
Take
it
from
me!
You
shut
your
mouth!
What?
I'm
just
talking
straight!
Talking
straight?
Don't
you
have
Don't
make
me
laugh!
Do
you
have
any
pity?
If
you
do,
why
don't
Want
a
fight?
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
Hey!
Samurai!
Look
at
this!
Know
what
those
suckers
eat?
They're
feeding
you
on
rice,
They're
giving
their
best!
I
see
Say
no
more!
I
won't
waste
your
food
Look!
Where
are
Rikichi
and
Yohei?
Still
looking
for
samurai!
You
really
think
Yes,
they're
coming.
Seven
Yes,
seven
Hmm...
seven!
You
said
"four,"
so
I
opposed
I
thought
we'd
probably
But,
if
I
told
you
that,
See
what
I
mean?
Grandad!
I
am
worried!
Our
girls
are
crazy
The
villagers
won't
like
Fool!
Have
you
What's
the
use
of
worrying
when
your
head's
You
need
my
help?
To
fight
whom?
Katsuishiro!
Hold
your
weapon
tightly
And
hit
him
as
he
comes
Hit
as
hard
as
you
can!
Splendid!
Please
forgive
us
My
name
is
Kambei
Shimada
I
must
find
some
talented
men,
Forgive
us
What
is
this?
Intolerable!
Outrageous!
Forgive
me.
You
see,
a
war
is
about
to
start
What
Clan?
Our
employer,
is
a
village
of
farmers
A
job
promising
no
pay
or
reward,
except
three
square
meals
What
stupidity!
My
ambition
is
a
bit
bigger
I'm
sorry
Is
that
final?
Yes!
What
a
big
loss,
sir!
So
alert
a
fencer!
What's
the
matter?
That
samurai
is
all
right.
Don't
be
foolish!
See
them
first.
Try
him!
One
moment,
sir!
Like
the
last
time?
Yes.
For
your
training
Please!
No
jokes
Forgive
me
Interesting
But...
I
realize
that
the
farmers
I
think
I
understand
But,
I'll
accept
because
The
deepest
friendship
often
Your
name?
Gorobei
Katayama
Sounds
strong,
but...
Yohei,
what's
wrong!
Come
on!
What's
wrong,
Yohei?
The
rice
is
gone!
You
fool!
So
I
told
you
so...
I
tried
my
best
to
watch
it!
At
night
I
slept,
I'll
get
some
from
home!
But,
what
will
we
do
It's
all
gone,
Don't
be
silly!
Here
he
comes!
This
is
wonderful!
It's
so
good
I'd
give
you
up
for
lost!
How
did
you
get
away?
I
laid
low
in
the
ditch,
When
the
castle
burned
down,
I
thought
that
was
my
end!
Were
you
terrified?
Not
particularly
Are
you
fed
up
with
fighting?
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I'm
preparing
for
a
tough
war
It
will
bring
us
neither
money
Yes!
Maybe
we
die
this
time
I
never
knew
they
were
so
scarce
What
are
you
after,
sir?
Samurai
There's
one
in
my
yard,
I
was
astonished
He
came
in
saying:
but
I'll
cut
your
firewood."
I
liked
his
frankness
Haven't
you
ever
seen
You
seem
to
enjoy
it
Oh,
that's
my
nature
You're
good
But
I'm
better
Killed
many?
Well
-
It's
impossible
So
I
usually
run
away
A
splendid
principle!
Thank
you
Incidentally,
Interested
in
killing
Let's
begin
Too
bad.
A
tie
No
I
won
You
did?
If
we
had
fought
seriously,
Let's
see!
No
use
Don't
you
see?
A
real
sword
will
kill
you.
Wait!
Halt!
You
can
say
What
a
waste
It's
so
obvious
Find
any?
Missed
one
A
first-class
swordsman
A
lost
fish
looks
big
But,
I
saw
his
prowess
He
is
terrific!
A
man
interested
only
So
his
answer
was
"No!"
Too
bad!
I
told
him
where
And
you?
I
caught
one
His
fencing
is...
second
class
But,
quite
a
character
A
cheerful
fellow
Good
company
in
adversity
Much
obliged
I
caught
one
too,
That
one
dressed
like
a
peddler?
Yes.
He
was
my
right
I'll
bring
clean
water
I'm
Heinachi
Hayashida,
a
fencer
Well,
three
more
to
find
Three?
Two
Can't
take
a
kid
Sir
I
know
I
know
your
line
I
was
a
young
man
like
you,
once
"Train
yourself
"Distinguish
yourself
in
war
"Because
somebody,
But,
time
flies
Before
your
dream
materializes
By
that
time,
your
parents
and
friends
Go
back
home,
you
had
enough
training
Good
experience
Please,
sir!
Take
him,
by
all
means.
But...
Do!
Even
though
Kids
are
often
more
Provided
that
we
treated
him
So,
let's
treat
him
like
one
Two
more
Just
one
more,
I
think
Hello!
You've
come!
Thank
you
-
And...?
Tomorrow?
Let's
forget
the
seventh.
Well
Sir!
-
Sir!
-
Sir!
Hey!
I
found
a
samurai!
A
real
tough
one!
A
fee-ro-shus
one!
He
drank
with
him
later
I
asked
him.
He's
coming!
Shall
I...?
What
are
you
doing?
Testing
That's
not
fair!
Just
watch
A
good
samurai
will
dodge
it
But
he's
drunk
A
real
samurai
would
never
get
Here
I
am!
See,
I
told
you
so!
Who
hit
me?
Oh!
It's
you
I
remember
your
head!
You
had
the
nerve
to
ask
me
Look!
Though
clad
in
rags,
I've
been
looking
for
you
Wanted
to
show
you
this!
Look
at
this!
You'll
know...
I
belong
to
This
one
is
me!
Kikuchiyo?
Is
that
your
name?
Yes,
sir!
"Born
on
February
17,
What's
so
funny?
You
don't
look
thirteen!
Listen!
If
you
are
the
Kikuchiyo
you
must
be
thirteen
years
old
Where
did
you
steal
this?
Steal?
To
hell
with
samurai!
Damn!
Steady,
Thirteen!
Sir
Kikuchiyo!
Courage,
Thirteen!
To
hell
with
samurai!
Is
he
really
samurai?
He
thinks
he
is
"Take
good
care
of
this!"
Take
me
with
you!
What's
the
matter,
Dad?
Why
do
you
stare
at
me
like
that?
Shino!
Cut
your
hair
short!
Cut
your
hair!
Dress
like
a
boy!
I
don't
understand!
Cut,
I
tell
you!
Samurai
are
coming!
You
don't
know
-
Come
and
cut
your
hair.
But
Manzo's
seen
those
samurai!
And
he
cut
her
hair!
You're
not
worried
because
-
I
get
it.
She'll
be
safer
at
your
place
Fool!
He
says
he's
worried
But
he's
only
worried
You're
a
prize
fool!
All
who
have
young
daughters
What
are
we
to
do?
The
samurai
are
coming
any
day
now!
Come!
Let's
go
see
the
Grandad!
Don't
stand
there!
Go!
Get
going!
We
should
do
something
before
Still
following
us!
I
don't
see
him!
Given
up?
Isn't
it
strange?
miss
him!
This
way!
Sheeyit!
So
that's
our
castle,
eh?
Huh!
I'd
hate
to
die
We
aren't
asking
you
to
Here
we
are!
I
brought
the
samurai!
What's
wrong?
Here
are
the
samurai!
Huh!
What's
wrong?
Well,
what
kind
of
hospitality
What
does
this
mean?
Hey!
What's
the
matter?
Let's
go
see
Grandad
He
handles
all
our
affairs
Village
patriarch,
eh?
He's
granting
us
an
audience
What
an
honor!
Let's
go
They're
being
very
foolish
indeed
Farmers
are
always
worrying
Rains,
dry
weather,
winds
In
other
words,
they
wake
up
Today's
no
exception
They're
just
scared,
But,
listen
Why
are
they
afraid
of
us?
Yet
they
expect
us
to
do
something
The
bandits!
Please!
Samurai,
please!
Help!
Bandits
are
coming!
Please
help!
Keep
calm!
Calm
down!
Answer
me
clearly!
From
which
direction
From
mountain!
From
front
road!
Those
who
saw
bandits,
Who
saw
bandits?
Who
beat
the
alarm?
I
did!
Don't
be
scared!
No
bandits
are
coming!
You
suckers!
You
welcomed
us
as
you
would
But
when
you
heard
the
alarm...
Oh!
Samurai!
You
turned
to
worship
us
Fools!
Any
objection,
Grandad?
No
It's
all
right
now
Well,
looks
like
maybe
So
now
we're
seven,
eh?
Sorry
this
place
is
so
filthy
But,
where
will
you
live?
I'll
sleep
in
the
stable
With
horses?
No!
The
bandits
took
them
last
year
A
stable
is
a
nice
place
I
have
no
wife!
Fool!
What's
your
real
name?
I
don't
remember
Give
me
a
good
name
Kikuchiyo!
It
becomes
you
How
would
you
attack
this
village?
I'd
charge
down
from
the
mountain
Down
this
road?
WEST
How
would
you
defend?
Shichiroji
sure
knows
his
business
Look
at
those
logs
He
plans
a
fence
Your
old
right
hand
man,
eh?
Remember!
A
war
is
run
We
run,
both
in
offense
and
defense
When
you
can't
run,
SOUTH
After
the
harvest,
we'll
flood
here
Then
this
will
be
well
defended
But
will
we
have
time
to
do
that?
Spear!
Go
ahead
and
spear!
Look!
I'm
a
bandit!
Come
on!
Next!
EAST
We'll
destroy
this
bridge
This
border
will
then
be
safe
What
about
those
houses?
Have
to
be
evacuated
That
mill,
too?
That
old
man
is
stubborn,
you
know
Remember
You're
afraid
of
the
enemies
But,
they're
afraid
of
you,
too!
You're
splendid!
Splendid
scarecrows!
But
they're
men,
not
sparrows,
You,
chewing
that
cud!
Stop
it!
You
are
not
a
cow!
You
on
the
end!
Step
forward!
I
mean
you!
You!
If
you
want
to
watch,
bring
money
What
is
this?
A
spear,
sir
Where
did
you
get
it?
Grown
on
a
bush?
I
know!
Samurai
on
the
run!
If
you
have
one,
the
others
Have
you?
Do
-
you
-
have
-
spears?
NORTH
Looks
peaceful
here.
Katsushiro!
Yes,
Sir!
I'm
coming!
Still
a
child
Are
you
one
of
the
villagers?
A
girl?
A
boy?
If
you
are
a
boy,
Picking
flowers
during
Come!
Good!
Good!
Hey!
What
are
you
doing!
A
big
haul!
What
have
you
got?
Taken
from
a
samurai
Where
did
you
get
those?
In
this
village?
At
Manzo's
Don't
like
them?
A
real
fine
one!
What's
the
matter?
You
wanted
Shame
on
you!
They
stripped
those
-
I
know.
One
who
has
never
been
Go
away!
It's
nothing!
I'd
like
to
kill
every
A
fine
idea!
Hey,
you!
What
do
you
all
think
of
farmers?
Saints?
Bah!
They're
foxy
beasts!
They
say:
"We've
no
rice,
we've
But
they
have!
They
have
everything!
Dig
under
the
floors!
Or
search
the
barns!
You'll
find
plenty!
Rice!
Salt!
Beans!
Sake!
Look
into
the
canyons!
Hidden
farms!
They
pose
as
saints
If
they
smell
a
battle,
Listen!
Farmers
are-
stingy,
foxy,
blubbering
mean,
stupid
and,
murderous!
God
damn!
But
then!
You
did!
You
burn
their
villages!
Destroy
their
farms!
Steal
their
food!
Force
them
to
labor!
Take
their
women!
And
kill
them
if
they
resist!
So
what
should
farmers
do?
Damn...
Damn...
You
are
a
farmer's
son.
Has...
has
anything
Nothing,
Grandad
Everything
is
all
right
I
sleep
here
from
tonight
I
don't
like
their
company
Fool!
Don't
make
yourself
small!
This
is
your
home?
You
gave
them
your
house
Scared
to
death!
Go
to
sleep!
It's
like
old
times
It's
so
quiet
I
can't
imagine
the
mountains
Sheeyit!
-
Where
to?
To
practice
No
women
up
there!
Sometimes
you
sound
What
are
you
making
now?
Our
banner
In
battle,
we'll
need
something
to
wave
What
does
it
mean?
This
says
"Farm."
-
These
circles?
Only
six,
eh?
I'm
out?
The
triangle
represents
you,
It's
rice.
-
Eat
it.
I
tasted
millet,
It
was
terrible
Go
ahead
Don't
be
shy.
I
won't
eat
it
Why?
I
brought
it
for
you
I'd
rather
give
it
Kyuemon's
Granny?
I'm
not
hungry
now
I'll
eat
later
You
eat
I'll
save
mine
What's
going
on?
This
is
terrible
No
relatives?
No,
sir.
The
bandits...
I
wish
I
could
die
right
away
I
want
to
die
soon,
to
escape
from
this
misery
But,
then
even
in
the
world
to
come,
there
must
be
great
misery,
There's
not!
No
war,
no
bandits,
No
misery,
either
How
do
you
know?
Why
yell
so
much?
I
hate
all
wretched
people!
I
feel
disgusted
with
them!
Damn!
I
want
to
do
something
Save
that
feeling
Didn't
you...
Did
you...
Did
you,
see
me
today,
The
girl?
Yes
Why
didn't
you
tell...?
You
want
me
to?
Give
us
some
rice!
Give
us
white
rice!
We
have
no
rice!
Don't
shout,
Give
us
rice!
Listen,
you
brats!
This
is
all
If
we
give
you
more,
See?
Say!
Hasn't
any
one
of
you
Anyone?
When
are
you
going
to
harvest?
After
ten
days
At
top
speed
how
long
Three
days,
at
least.
I
want
to
flood
it,
then
We
need
a
moat
so
no
horsemen
can
approach
This
moat
need
not
be
wide
Well,
we'll
dig
a
waterway
The
work
can
be
done
in
one
day
Thanks
And
there's
another
thing
Those
three
houses
must
be
evacuated
when
What?
Me
evacuate?
I'm
sorry
We
can't
help
it
We
can't
cover
this
big
an
area
Listen!
The
crops
will
soon
be
harvested
Then,
the
bandits
will
come
Let's
be
ready
From
now
on
we
must
be
on
the
alert
We'll
harvest
in
groups,
From
tomorrow,
Remember!
You
move
as
a
group,
Listen,
men!
Love
your
wives
plenty
tonight
It's
stupid!
Come,
neighbors!
Throw
them
away!
Let's
not
risk
ourselves
Come!
Let's
protect
our
own
homes!
Stop!
Pick
up
your
spears!
Where
is
Yohei?
You
fool!
The
outlying
houses
are
three
The
village
has
twenty
We
can't
endanger
No
outlying
house
can
be
saved
while
the
village
proper
Remember!
That's
war!
You're
all
in
one
boat!
He
who
thinks
only
about
himself
Such
selfishness
INTERMISSION
Sheeyit!
Who
would
So
many
women
lived
here!
Where
were
you
hiding
these
girls?
Give
me
your
sickle!
I'll
cut
a
lot
for
you
So
let's
be
good
friends,
eh?
Rikichi!
I
see
that
the
married
couples
I'd
wish
you'd
marry
soon
Why
are
you
angry?
I
only...
Katsushiro,
bring
him
back!
Why
did
he
run
away?
Shino,
stop
dreaming!
What
is
this?
It's
been
sickled
Rikichi,
eh?
I
didn't
witness
it
I
was
looking
for
him,
His
face
was
strained
and
sweaty
What
did
you
say
to
him?
Nothing.
Something
pretty
painful
His
face
tells
me
that
His
lips
are
tightly
set,
Try
to
open
them
Who's
there?
It's
me!
Is
everything
all
right?
Won't
you
sit
down?
Let's
talk
Often,
just
talking
Speaking
about
a
suffering
Incidentally,
you're
But,
if
you
have
something
better
let
it
out
And
I
believe
this
is
I've
nothing
bottled
up
Let's
go
out
Don't
wake
him.
He
said
"Shino."
Shino
is...
A
woman's
name
Certainly
doesn't
sound
Where
shall
we
begin?
First,
the
weakest
Who's
there?
Who's
there?
Come
out!
Who's
there?
Kikuchiyo!
You're
lucky!
Had
it
been
the
bandits,
Yohei!
What
is
this?
My
horse,
sir
I
thought
it
was
a
fat
mouse
Sparrow
singing,
crows
crowing
What's
the
matter?
If
they
don't
come,
what
a
loss!
Hiring
those
greedy
samurai!
-
Fool!
What
are
you
going
to
do
Stop
it!
If
you
cripple
it,
What
are
you
talking
about?
He's
doing
all
right!
That
looks
good!
They're
merry
The
thrashing
is
finished
They're
beginning
to
think
Wishful
thinking
Danger
strikes
when
Tell
them
to
take
up
their
posts!
I
wish
I
were
a
samurai's
daughter
A
farmer's
life
is
wretched
I'm
too
fortunate.
I'm
shamed
Oh,
I
don't
mean
that
You're
samurai
and
I'm
a
peasant
I
never...
Oh,
I
don't
mind
that!
I'm
not
worrying
about
the
future!
You
chicken!
Aren't
you
samurai?
Three
strangers
near
-
No
one
else
knows
about
this.
Let's
keep
quiet
I
saw
three
horses
on
the
hill!
The
bandits!
I
know
-
They're
here!
It's
evident.
This
commotion
From
which
direction?
The
west
The
bandits
are
coming!
Tell
them
to
stay
inside
It's
only
three
bandits
Keep
them
quiet
They
must
be
scouts
They
must
not
see
us
What's
up?
The
bandits?
They've
come?
Quiet!
Where?
That
tree...!
Scouts,
undoubtedly
They're
surprised
to
see
the
fence
They
don't
know
about
us
I
hope
you're
right
Where
is
everybody?
What
a
fool!
Kikuchiyo!
Have
they
come?
Is
that
right?
Now
they've
seen
us!
Now
that
they
know,
I'll
kill
them.
I
didn't
know...
Go.
Catch
one
of
them
Take
a
short
cut
Yes,
to
the
horses
Katsushiro!
You
just
watch!
Understand?
Gee!
Good
horses!
You
lie
here
-
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Katsushiro!
It's
all
over
now
Come
out
Wait!
This
is
a
prisoner
of
war!
He's
begging
for
mercy!
We
don't
need
your
help!
Let
her
avenge
her
son's
death!
Somebody!
Assist
her!
According
to
that
bandit,
-
Flimsy!
as
Yohei's
trousers!
If
it's
that
approachable
-
Let's
attack.
We
must
decrease
them
if
we
can
do
it
We
couldn't
afford
a
loss
Any
battle
is
a
gamble
Three
can
kill
at
least
ten
Is
that
place
very
far
from
here?
A
day's
walk
But
we
have
horses
now!
Then
half
a
day
All
right!
If
we
leave
now,
But
who?
Not
you!
I
go!
It's
decided!
Me
too!
-
Not
enough
horses!
You
ride
Yohei's
horse.
You
fool!
This
way!
Damn
you!
You
call
yourself
a
horse!
Hey!
Wait!
Please!
I
apologize!
Forgive
me!
Set
fire
to
all
the
huts!
And
we'll
kill
them
Looking
good,
fool!
Damn!
Good
work!
Rikichi!
Look
out!
Rikichi!
Come
back,
Rikichi!
Fool!
What're
you
doing?
You
fool!
It's
your
fault!
Who
was
she?
My
wife!
Heihachi!
Hang
on!
We
were
counting
on
him
to
cheer
us
And
now
he's
gone!
Don't
cry!
Don't
cry,
fool!
At
last
they've
come!
Don't
forget!
Three
guns!
Twenty
to
the
north,
-
Guns?
Go
to
the
south.
To
the
rear!
To
the
rear!
Twelve
shifting
to
the
east!
Thirteen!
An
arrow
got
one!
Good
old
Gorobei!
Now
go
see
if
the
bridge
was
cut
-
And...
Go
to
the
north
The
decisive
battle
Why
didn't
you
build
A
good
fort
needs
a
gap
The
enemy
must
be
lured
in.
If
only
defend,
we
lose
the
war
What's
wrong
with
you!
Twelve
are
coming!
Quick!
Are
you
blind?
And
look
out
for
their
guns!
I
know!
Hey!
Stop!
I
must
find
my
dad!
He's
in
there!
He
always
wanted
to
die
The
stubborn
dotard!
Go
and
get
him!
Hey!
Get
away!
Be
quick
about
it,
fools!
On
this
hill,
Twelve
at
the
east
I
don't
like
it.
They're
scared
Once
again!
Once
again!
That's
Shichiroji!
Come
out,
all
of
you!
Now,
yell!
I
see!
Let's
out-yell
them!
Yohei!
What's
wrong
with
your
face!
Here
they
come!
Hey!
Get
back!
Get
going!
Damn!
Fool!
Damn!
Forget
those
worthless
shacks!
Back
to
your
posts!
All
of
you!
Damn!
You
wolves!
That's
Grandad's
house!
Where
is
he?
And
the
child?
God
Damn!
What
troublesome
fools!
Wait!
Don't
leave
your
post!
Kikuchiyo!
Come
back!
Kikuchiyo!
Where
are
your
men?
Speared!
What
will
power!
Hey!
Kikuchiyo!
Follow
me!
What
is
it?
The
same
thing
happened
to
me!
I
was
just
like
this
baby!
Here
I
come
What
were
you
staring
at?
Everybody
all
right?
Well
done!
Great!
I
smell
a
gun
fuse!
Manzo!
Where
are
you
hit?
Shino!
Bring
her!
Don't!
A
flea
bite
is
bigger.
It's
foolish
to
reveal
Hey!
Halt!
That'll
do!
Well
done!
What's
your
name?
I'm
Rikichi!
They
attacked
from
three
directions
Next
it
will
be
here
It
may
not
be
tonight
But,
they'll
come
But
it's
awfully
quiet
out
there
Right.
However,
their
main
force
is
there
I'll
show
you
Good
work!
Stick
up
that
scarecrow
Probably
in
the
morning,
they'll
launch
their
attack
here
We'll
let
them
get
in
Not
all
of
them
Just
one
Or
two
As
soon
as
they
enter,
and
trap
them!
They'll
be
helpless
We'll
decrease
them
one
by
one
What
about
their
guns?
We
must
decrease
them,
also
I'll
get
one!
I
sure
will!
No,
you
don't!
I'll
go
I
hear
a
footstep!
Katsushiro!
That's
O.K.
Really
I
did!
Listen!
Rest.
I
tell
you!
You're
tired!
Yes.
I
hear
it
Killed
two
What's
the
matter?
What
is
it?
Hurry!
I
need
sleep
You
are...
really
great!
I've
always
wanted
They
coming?
We'll
let
one
in!
We'll
let
one
in!
Don't
forget
to
close
Oh!
They're
coming!
Good!
What's
wrong?
Well
done!
Deploy!
They're
coming!
Fall
back!
Fall
back!
Let's
go
forward!
We'll
let
another
one
in!
Oh!
Here
they
come!
This
is
fun!
What
were
you
playing,
dear?
They're
getting
wise
-
They're
mollycoddles!
Four
killed
just
now
Kyuro
got
two
last
night
He
has
real
samurai
spirit
He's
fearless
and
skillful!
And
also
gentle!
So
modest,
even
after
When
he
left
the
hill,
he
looked
You're
amusing.
Your
jabbering
Yohei!
Keep
watch!
Don't
make
such
a
wry
face
It's
quite
safe
here!
A
scarecrow
could
handle
it!
Remember!
Every
coward
will
Everything
all
right?
They're
plenty
tough!
It'll
be
over
soon
The
thing
is
upside
down!
We're
all
burnt
out
And
hungrier
than
farmers!
Don't
complain!
I'm
depending
on
you,
Brother!
I'll
shoot
you
It's
me!
It's
me!
Great
work,
fools!
You
fool!
Look
at
this!
The
post
is
safe
Going
on
your
own
In
war,
it's
teamwork
that
counts!
Gorobei,
Kyouzo!
Let
no
one
through!
Fall
back!
You!
Hey!
You!
Good
God!
God
Damn!
God
Damn!
God
Damn!
Yohei!
Where's
Yohei?
I
was
watching!
Hang
on!
Yohei!
Damn!
Shichirogi.
Take
over!
Gorobei!
Gorobei!
Thirteen
left
But
the
last
seven
were
costly!
Hey!
Are
you
tired?
You
look
worn
out,
old
man!
I'll
go
wash
my
face
The
next
clash
will
be
If
we
must
attack,
let's
do
it
When
do
you
think
Well,
they
are
tired
too
Some
are
wounded.
But,
they're
hungry.
there's
dissension
among
them.
Let's
expect
them
to
come
in
Katsushiro!
Katsushiro!
The
chief
wants
all
men
Two
sentries
will
keep
watch
Also,
one
by
one,
the
men
The
decisive
battle
at
last,
eh?
Yes.
Please
spread
the
word
You
heard
the
order,
didn't
you?
I'll
keep
watch
You
go
to
sleep
Now
-
Manzo!
Run
back
home
See
your
daughter
I
mean
-
your
son!
I
told
them
Good.
Now
rest
Tell
me,
Still
at
the
graves,
sir
We'll
die
tomorrow!
We
may
not
But,
probably
we
will
die!
Shino!
Where
are
you,
Shino?
Shino?
Where
are
you,
Shino?
Sake,
eh?
I
see
It's
just
as
Kikuchiyo
said
They
have
lots
of
things
I'll
take
this,
then
Shino!
Shino!
Here's
some
sake.
This
is
not
like
you
Be
bold
and
fight
hard!
Shino!
You
no
good
wench!
Don't
be
violent!
What
do
you
mean,
Manzo!
Is
this
your
daughter?
Tell
me!
You
said
she
fell
for
a
samurai.
Manzo!
Speak
up!
Tell
us!
Are
you
Shino?
Manzo!
Don't
be
so
angry!
When
a
man
sees
he
feels
the
need
just
before
a
battle
It
happens
even
in
a
castle!
Have
some
sympathy
for
youngsters!
I
can't!
My
daughter's
been
seduced!
But
they
love
each
other!
And
she
wasn't
given
to
bandits!
Everybody's
too
nervous
Relax!
Everybody.
At
last
By
the
way,
Katsushiro!
Fight
bravely!
Now
you're
a
full-fledged
man!
Hey!
Hey!
Show
some
guts!
With
those
faces
you
won't
win
Kikuchiyo,
what
on
earth
I
can't
kill
a
lot
Only
thirteen
left!
Let
them
all
come
in!
We'll
immediately
And
trap
them
at
the
crossing!
This
fight
will
decide
Here
they
come!
Here
they
come!
Shichirogi,
Katsushiro
West!
Kyouzo,
Kikuchiyo
East!
Katsushiro!
Rikichi!
Katsushiro!
Go
to
the
east!
Quiet!
Or
you
die!
Good.
Well
done!
I
did
it!
I
did
it!
Stand
up!
Katsushiro...
Stand
up
Be
careful
Damn
you!
Damn!
Kikuchiyo!
The
bandits!
The
bandits!
All
dead!
Again,
we've
survived
Again
we're
defeated
The
winners
are
those
farmers
Not
us
THE
END
