Master
Li
is
here!
Shu
Lien!
Li
Mu
Bai
is
here!
-
How's
everything?
Mu
Bai...
It
has.
-
How's
business?
-
And
how
are
you?
Monk
Zheng
said
He
said
you
were
practicing
The
mountain
I
envy
you.
My
work
keeps
me
so
busy,
I
left
the
training
early.
Why?
You're
a
Wudan
fighter.
During
my
meditation
training...
I
came
to
a
place
I
was
surrounded
by
light...
Time
and
space
disappeared.
I
had
come
to
a
place
my
master
You
were
enlightened?
No.
I
didn't
feel
the
bliss
Instead...
I
was
surrounded
I
couldn't
bear
it.
I
broke
off
my
meditation.
I
couldn't
go
on.
There
was
something...
What
was
it
?
Something
I
can't
let
go
of.
You're
leaving
soon?
We're
preparing
a
convoy
to
Peking.
Perhaps
I
could
ask
you...
to
deliver
something
The
Green
Destiny
sword?
I
am.
He
has
always
been
I
don't
understand.
It
has
always
been
with
you.
Too
many
men
have
died
It
only
looks
pure
because
blood
You
use
it
justly,
It's
time
for
me
So
what
will
you
do
now?
Come
with
me
to
Peking.
You
can
give
the
sword
to
Sir
Te
It'll
be
just
like
old
times.
First
I
must
visit
It's
been
many
years
since...
Jade
Fox
murdered
him.
And
yet
I'm
thinking
of
quitting.
I
must
pray
for
his
forgiveness.
Join
me
I
can
wait
for
you
in
Peking.
Perhaps.
Okay.
Pass.
Thanks.
Let's
go
into
the
city.
Everything
got
here
safely.
Just
doing
my
job.
Sun
Security
has
been
the
best
You're
a
credit
to
his
memory.
Thank
you.
I
mean
it.
This
is
Li
Mu
Bai's
a
great
hero's
weapon.
He
is
the
only
one
in
the
world
It's
too
fine
a
gift.
Sir
Te...
It
has
brought
him
Help
him
to
leave
Otherwise,
he'll
never
be
able
All
right.
I'll
act
as
the
sword's
custodian.
Governor
Yu
has
arrived.
I
must
change.
You've
always
been
so
good
Please
accept
our
thanks.
Please
do
not
be
such
a
stranger.
Now,
Shu
Lien...
tell
me
something.
And
forgive
me
for
prying.
Your
father
and
I
think
of
you
Please,
Sir
Te,
what
is
it?
Li
Mu
Bai
giving
up
his
sword...
and
his
warrior
days...
Maybe
he's
trying
I
don't
know...
Don't
be
coy.
I've
always
known
All
these
years,
it's
a
shame...
neither
of
you
is
brave
enough
You're
both
wasting
precious
time.
I
beg
your
pardon.
When
it
comes
to
emotions,
even
great
heroes
can
be
idiots.
Tell
me
if
Li
Mu
Bai
is
not
more
I'll
give
him
an
earful!
Sir
Te
said
Who
are
you?
I'm
your
guest
today.
I
am
Governor
Yu's
daughter.
This
is
Sir
Te's
study.
I
was
just
looking
I
am
Sir
Te's
head
servant.
And
this
is
another
of
our
guests.
It's
heavy
The
handle
is
heavy.
Still,
the
sword
You're
just
not
used
But,
I
have
had
much
practice.
As
a
child
in
the
West,
They'd
let
me

The
scabbard
is
so
beautiful.
Beautiful
but
dangerous.
Once
you
see
it
tainted
with
blood,
It's
40000
years
old.
Exquisite!
You
said
it
belongs
to...
My
friend
Li
Mu
Bai.
Li
Mu
Bai!
The
famous
warrior?
Why
would
he
give
his
sword
You're
too
young
to
understand.
You're
a
sword
fighter
too?
Yes,
I
am.
But
I
prefer
the
machete.
Certain
moves,
however,
Really?
It
must
be
exciting

I
heard.
It's
the
most
important
step
You're
not
married,
are
you?
What
do
you

No!
You
couldn't

You're

I

you

Do
you

She's
one
of
those.
Your

not

you
I'll

I'm
tired
now!
Go
to

then.
Miss
has
grown
up,
God
knows
It'll
be
just
the

Enough!
I'm
tired.
Autumn
is
coming.
I'll
shut

for
you.
-
Chilly,
eh?
Someone
help!
Stop
him!
He's
on
the
roof!
The
sword's
been
stolen!
Stop
thief!
Stop
him!
It's
Jade
Fox!
We
must
avenge
Mother!
Do
something!
Return
the
sword
You've
been
trained
at
Wudan?
You're
mistaken.
We're
just
street
performers.
Father!
You
were
rehearsing?
Who
are
you
trying
to
fool?
Where
did
that
thief
go?
Governor
Yu's
house!
Get
down
here!
Give
back
the
sword!
Sir
Te
awaits
you.
I'm
sure
the
thief
How
dare
you
imply?
Enough!
Has
Governor
Yu
Yes,
though
I
doubt
But
the
sword
Then
someone's
trying
We
should
inform
Li
Mu
Bai.
What
is
it?
Madam
Yu,
Let
me
see.
Someone
is
after
a
Jade
Fox.
Preposterous,
looking
for
her
here!
-
Where
are
they?
I
haven't
seen
them
in
two
days.
There's
a
Miss
Shu
Lien
here
Miss
is
busy
right
now.
I'll
tell
her.
Show
her
in.
This
spells
trouble.
I
have
a
guest.
This
way
please.
I've
missed
you.
How
so?
I'm
bored...
You're
doing
calligraphy?
I'll
write
your
name.
Just
for
fun.
I
never
realized
my
name
You
write
gracefully.
Calligraphy
Maybe
it
is.
I
wouldn't
know.
Please.
Thank
you
for
seeing
me.
You
must
be
overwhelmed
I'm
hardly
doing
a
thing.
My
parents
The
Gous
are
a
very
powerful
family.
My
marrying
one
will
be
good
You
are
fortunate
Am
I?
I
wish
I
were
like
the
heroes
Like
you
and
Li
Mu
Bai.
I
guess
I'm
happy
to
be
marrying.
But
to
be
free
to
choose
whom
I
love...
That
is
true
happiness.
Do
you
think
so?
About
you
and
Li
Mu
Bai?
Yes.
Did
you
know
I
was
once
engaged
No,
really?
His
name
was
Meng
Si
Zhao.
He
was
a
brother
to
Li

One
day,
while
in
battle...
he
was
killed
by
the
sword
After,

Too
bad
for
Meng,
but

am
not
an
aristocrat,
but
I
must
still
respect
Don't
distance
us.
From
now
on,
let's
be
like
sisters.
Then
as
a
sister,
let
me
wish
you
What
a
godforsaken
place!
Can't
your
father
be
appointed
Jen...
are
you
listening
to
me?
Let's
go.
Who
are
you?
Wait!
I'm
a
friend!
I
don't
care
about
your
sword.
Why
were
you
spying
on
the
Yus?
I'm
looking
for
someone.
I'm
a
police
inspector
Jade
Fox
is
a
master
criminal.
She
must
have
come
with
them
But
with
Yu's
reputation,
-
This
Jade
Fox
is
a
woman?
Then
leave
her
to
me.
Pardon
me,
My
wife
was
Jade
Fox
killed
her.
So
you
see...
this
is
personal.
It's
ready.
I'm
ready
for
anything!
Father
gets
first
dip.
They're
gone!
What
does
it
say?
''We'll
settle
this
at
midnight
Good!
The
fox
is
out
of
her
hole!
Shu
Lien,
look
who's
here.
Sir
Te
believes
it's
a
ploy
But
something
is
going
on
What
have
you
discovered?
Jade
Fox?
Impossible!
You'd
always
suspected
I
didn't
think
she'd
dare
Is
there
any
place
safer
So
I
shall
avenge
Be
careful.
Sir
Te
requires
discretion.
Official
business
Don't
let
personal
feelings
And
I
don't
know...
could
be
some
sort
of
trap.
Did
you
see
who
posted
it?
No.
It
says
Fox
is
hiding
at
Yu's.
On
the
night
of
the
theft
Were
you
involved?
It
was
Bo,
Sir
Te's
man.
I
hear
he
followed
the
thief
Have
you
questioned
him
yet?
No,
not
yet...
But
your
men
are
watching
over
No,
I'd
already
sent
them
home.
You
can
blame
me
but
please
trust
using
my
own
methods.
That's
not
what
I
meant.
I
don't
care
about
the
sword.
What
do
you
mean?
I
didn't
know
it
was
stolen
Then,
why
did
you
come?
Well,
we
had
talked--
Pardon
my
intrusion.
your
room
is
ready.
Thank
you.
Please,
lead
the
way.
The
Fox
doesn't
care
much
Still
no
sign
of
her.
Enough!
Show
yourself!.
Tsai...
You
dog!
You
will
pay
That's
what
you
think,
old
witch!
If
you
surrender
now,
But
if
you
resist,
Father!
Let
me
avenge
my
mother's
death!
You'll
soon
end
up
like
her,
You'll
pay
for
that!
She's
going
to
paralyze
you!
May!
Tsai,
you
filthy
mongrel!
An
ambush!
Father,
are
you
all
right?
Wudan
should
have
gotten
It's
been
a
long
time,
Jade
Fox!
You
don't
remember
me...
But
you
should
You
infiltrated
Wudan
You
stole
our
secret
manual...
and
poisoned
our
master!
Now
it's
time
for
you
to
pay!
Your
master
Sure,
he'd
sleep
with
me,
He
deserved
to
die
You
stole
the
secrets
But
after
ten
years
of
training
And
today...
under
a
Wudan
sword...
you
will
die!
Disciple,
we'll
kill
them
all!
Let's
go!
Another
one!
I
must
get
rid
of
Tsai!
Who
are
you?
Why
is
the
Green
Destiny
What's
it
to
you?
My
name
is
Li
Mu
Bai.
The
Green
Destiny
is
mine.
Jade
Fox
can't
be
your
master.
Where
did
you
learn
I'm
just
playing
around.
Tell
me,
who
is
your
master?
-
Let's
go!
Father!
This
is
Tsai?
My
father.
Police
inspector
from
Shaan.
This
should
be
reported
The
victim
is
an
officer.
You
believe
the
killer
I'd
bet
my
life
on
it!
Come
with
me.
This
needs
to
be
resolved,
I'll
get
into
the
Yu
household
I'll
ferret
out
Fox
and
her
gang.
We
must
be
careful.
Yu
is
a
court
official,
Any
disturbance
It
might
get
Sir
Te
in
trouble.
This
is
a
delicate
matter.
Sir
Te,
can
you
find
some
excuse...
to
invite
What
do
you
have
in
mind?
The
best
way
to
trap
a
fox
Madam
Te
is
certainly
spoiling
us
She's
being
so
considerate.
I'm
sorry
she's
not
feeling
I
heard
Sir
Te
lost
something.
And
now
Madam
Te's
We
know
who
stole
If
the
thief
returns
it,
the
matter
no
further.
That's
good.
Sometimes
the
help
can't
keep
It's
very
embarrassing.
Sir
Te
knows
that
even
well-meaning
that
can
bring
ruin
to
themselves
But
don't
be
too
lenient.
No
mercy
will
be
shown
who
turned
up
in
Peking.
A
murderer?
Yes...
the
very
killer
Last
night...
she
killed
a
policeman
A
female
criminal!
You
say
she
killed
Yes,
from
the
West.
He
went
undercover,
Maybe
the
murderer...
and
the
thief
are
the
same.
I
doubt
that.
This
thief...
is
very
unusual.
And
most
likely
smarter
Greetings,
Sir
Te.
Hello,
Madam
Yu.
This
is
Li
Mu
Bai...
the
renowned
swordsman.
Delighted
to
meet
you.
Miss
Yu
is
soon
to
be
married.
Congratulations.
Why
don't
you
come
in?
I'm
standing
guard.
Come
in.
It's
cold.
Come
in.
We
don't
have
to
fear
Jade
Fox
Isn't
it
a
bit
late
to
be
out?
You've
brought
me
the
sword?
I
do
as
I
please.
Where
is
your
master?
What's
it
to
you?
Had
enough
flying?
You've
got
potential.
You've
studied
the
Wudan
manual
You
need
a
real
master.
Do
you
think
Like
most
things,
It's
the
same
for
this
sword.
All
of
it
is
simply
Stop
talking
like
a
monk!
Just
fight!
Then
tell
me
where
Jade
Fox
is.
On
guard!
Real
sharpness
No
growth.
Without
assistance.
No
action.
Without
reaction.
No
desire
without
restraint.
Now
give
yourself
up
There
is
a
lesson
for
you.
Go
ahead.
Why
should
I?
You
need
practice.
I
can
teach
you
but
first
you
must
learn
Why
do
you
want
to
teach
me?
I've
always
wanted
a
disciple...
worthy
of
Wudan's
secrets.
And
if
I
use
them
That's
a
risk
I'm
willing
to
take.
Deep
down,
you're
good.
Wudan
is
a
whorehouse!
Keep
your
lessons!
You're
home
late...
or
should
I
say
early?
Why
are
you
still
here?
You
should
leave!
You'll
bring
ruin
They
wouldn't
have
found
me
Like
a
little
girl,
You,
too,
are
responsible
You
don't
want
to
waste
your
life
Denied
your
talent...
As
master
and
disciple
I'll
never
live
as
a
thief!.
You're
already
a
thief.
That
was
just
for
fun.
How
can
I
leave?
Wherever
we
want.
We'll
get
rid
of
anyone
Even
your
father.
Shut
up!
It's
the
Giang
Hu
fighter
Exciting,
isn't
it?
I
owe
you
nothing.
Yes,
you
do!
You
are
still
my
disciple.
You
think
you've
been
teaching
me
You
couldn't
even
I
studied
the
diagrams.
But
you
hid
the
details!
You
wouldn't
have
understood,
You
know...
you've
gone
as
far
as
you
can
go.
I
hid
my
skills
If
I
hadn't
seen
you
I'd
still
be
ignorant
Master...
I
started
learning
from
you
You
enchanted
me
But
once
I
realized
I
became
so
frightened!
Everything
fell
apart.
I
had
no
one
to
guide
me...
no
one
to
learn
from.
Believe
me...
I've
a
lesson
or
two
left
The
sword
is
back...
Are
you
happy?
I
admit...
getting
it
back
makes
me
realize
But
it's
not
your
sword
anymore.
You
gave
it
to
Sir
Te.
True.
But
I
must
borrow
it
Jade
Fox
must
die
at
its
edge.
Did
you
know
what
you
were
hiding
My
job
was
to
get
the
sword
back,
I
wasn't
about
to
ruin...
her
life,
or
her
father's.
You
did
your
job
well.
But,
this
girl...
I
saw
her
last
night.
I
knew
she
would
intrigue
you.
She
needs
direction...
and
training.
She's
an
aristocrat's
daughter.
In
any
case,
You'll
kill
Fox,
and
she'll
marry.
That's
not
for
her.
She
should
come
to
Wudan
But
Wudan
does
not
accept
women.
For
her,
they
might
If
not,
I'm
afraid
she'll
become
It's
not
our
affair.
Even
if
Wudan
accepts
her,
I
thought
by
giving
away
the
sword,
I
could
escape
the
Giang
Hu
world.
But
the
cycle
of
bloodshed
I
wish
there
were
something
more...
I
could
do
to
help
you.
Just
be
patient
with
me,
Shu
Lien.
Lo?
Jen!
You
shouldn't
have
come.
With
all
the
traffic
it
took
me
a
while
I
can't
wait
any
longer.
I
was
wrong
to
let
you
go.
Come
back
with
me.
You'll
be
happy
in
the
desert.
You'll
be
free
there.
You've
been
looking
for
me
Jen...
Stop
playing
with
it.
I
won't
break
it.
It's
Dark
Cloud!
Dark
Cloud
is
coming!
Lower
the
shade,
Don't
touch
the
women!
Let's
go!
Come
get
your
comb.
Hurry
back
to
your
mother.
She's
mine!
Leave
her
to
me!
Come
and
get
it!
Give
me
back
my
comb!
Let's
stop
a
moment.
Give
it
back!
You're
tired.
You
need
rest.
Your
horse
needs
water.
Well,
there
used
to
be!
What's
your
name?
I'm
Lo.
The
Hans
call
me
Dark
Cloud.
I'm
not
that
tall
or
big...
but
I'm
quick
as
lightning.
My
comb!
If
you
like
that
arrow,
Great

chicken.
They're
delicious.
You
need
to
eat.
Then
you'll
have

You're
eating
too
fast.
Slowly.
You've
got
quite
a
temper.
It's
better
this
way...
You
coward!
Still
in
a
bad
mood?
At
least
you're
speaking.
What's
your
name?
I
didn't
think

Relax.
If
I
had
wanted

I
would
You
must
be
dying
for
a
bath.
Fresh
water's
hard
to
get
here.
But
I
managed
to
bring
some
up.
You
can
wear
my
clothes
They're
clean.
Don't
worry.
I'll
sing,
After
the
bath,
No
more
hitting
on
the
head!
All
this
trouble
for
a
comb?
It's
mine.
It
means
a
lot
to
me.
A
barbarian
Not
true.
I
can
use
it
By
the
way,
I'm
sorry...
I
guessed
wrong.
I
thought
you
were
a
Han.
Give
me
back
my
comb.
I
don't
take
orders
from
anyone.
Give
it
back.
One
night...
when
I
was
a
boy,
I
saw
I
thought,
I'm
an
orphan.
I
thought
if
I
rode
to
the
other
I've
been
riding
in
the
desert
And
so,
the
little
boy
He
couldn't
find

here,

always
fight
You
have
to
be

my
life
easier.
So
you
are
still
that
little
boy...
looking
for
shooting
stars.
I
am
a
man.
And
now
I've
found
Your
father's
men
They're
still
out
there,
Let
them
look.
It
is
trouble
for
me.
Don't
send
me
back.
You
must
decide.
You
might
get
tired
of
this
life.
You
might
begin
If
it

Jen...
I
want
you
to

I
will
make
my
mark
I
will

your

you!
A

needle!
You
deserve
to
die...

the
life
was
Jen's.
Ten
years
I
devoted
to
you.
But
you
deceived
me!
You
hid
I
never
improved...
but
your
progress
was
limitless!
You
know
what
poison
is?
An
eight-year-old
girl...
full
of
deceit.
Jen!
My
only
family...
my
only
enemy...
You
can't
die!
Tell
us
what
poison
you
used!
You
can't
die!
Tell
us
the
antidote!
You
can't
let
Li
Mu
Bai
die!
She
used
Purple
Yin...
Purple
Yin
poison.
It
goes
straight
to
the
heart.
It's
the
same
poison
she
used
My
blood
There
is
no
antidote.
That
can't
be!
Why
not
this?
The
antidote
exists.
She
taught
it
to
me.
The
formula
is
simple...
but
it
takes
time
to
prepare.
Trust
me.
As
you
have
helped
me...
let
me
help

All
right.

it!

is
departing.
I've
only
one
breath
left.
Use
it
to
meditate.
Free
yourself
from
this
world...
as
you
have
been
taught.
Let
your
soul
rise
to
eternity...
with
your
last
breath.
Do
not
waste
it...
for
me.
I've
already
wasted
I
want
to
tell
you
I
have
always
loved
you.
I
would
rather
be
a
ghost,
as
a
condemned
soul...
than
enter
heaven
without
you.
Because
of
your
love...
I
will
never
be
a
lonely
spirit.
He's
gone?
Bo...
please

must
