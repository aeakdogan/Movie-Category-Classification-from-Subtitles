Woof,

Oh,
I'm
gonna

I
know,
we're
all
gonna
die.
But
I'm
gonna
die
today.
Funny,
that.
You
know,
to
know...
But
the
thing
is,
it's
that
I'm
still
scared.
I'm
really
scared.
Nobody
will
mourn
for
me,
Will
you
mourn
for
me?
Will
you
say
a
prayer
for
me?
Or
is
it
too
late?

I
mean,
I'd
say
one
for
myself,
Nobody
ever
taught
me
how.
Nobody
ever
taught
me
how.


A
baby.


There's
a
baby
with
you,
huh?
Is
that
a
lullaby
you're
singing?

That's
so
sweet.
I
used
to
sing
to
my
baby.
I
hope
I
see
her
soon.


That's
nice,
Aningaaq.
Sing
me
to
sleep,
and
I'll
sleep.
Keep
singing.
And
sing
and
sing.

No,
no,
no,
don't!
Check
your
watch.
Call
Anatoly
and
tell
him
he's
been
bumped.
-It's
a
little
gloomy
in
here,
isn't
it?
-
Trust
me,
it's
a
hell
of
a
story.

That's
better.
I
found
a
little
extra--
It
helps
that
I
didn't
have
you
around
I
have
to
say,
I'm
glad
to
see
you.
I
didn't
think
you
were
gonna
make
it.
Did
you
find
the
vodka?
-
You
never
told
me
where
it
was,
so...
Ah,
ah!

To
Anatoly.

Huh?
No?
All
right.
Let's
get
out
of
here.
The
Chinese
station's
about
100
miles.
Just
a
little
Sunday
drive.
-
We
can't.
-
There's
no
fuel,
I
tried
everything.
I
tried
everything.
Did
you
try
the
soft
landing
jets?
They're
for
landing,
so...
Landing
is
launching.
It's
the
same.
-
I
never
got
to
land
the
simulator,
I
told
you.
-
And
I
crashed
it
every
time.
I
get
it,
it's
nice
up
here.
You
can
just
shut
down
all
the
systems...
...turn
out
all
the
lights...
...and
just
close
your
eyes
There's
nobody
up
here
that
can
hurt
you.
It's
safe.
I
mean,
what's
the
point
of
going
on?
Your
kid
died.
But
still,
it's
a
matter
of
what
you
do
now.
If
you
decide
to
go,
Sit
back,
enjoy
the
ride.
You
gotta
plant
both
your
feet
How
did
you
get
here?
I'm
telling
you,
it's
a
hell
of
a
story.
Hey,
Ryan?
What?
It's
time
to
go
home.


Landing...
Landing...
Landing
is
launching.
I
said...

Okay,
landing,
landing.
Landing
is
green.
Agh.
Okay.
Okay,
landing.
All
right.
Okay.
Soft
landing
jets
...at
3
meters
before
landing,
so...
Oh,
you're
a
clever
son
of
a
bitch,
Matt.
I
need
to...
I
need
to
get
rid
of
the
Bay-O...
...and
the
engine
module.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Tri-module
separation.
Go.
Okay.
Houston,
here's
the
tricky
part.
Soyuz
has
to
think...
...we
are
3
meters
off
the
Earth.
All
right.
Okay.
Hey,
Matt?
Since
I
had
to
listen
to
endless
hours...
...of
your
storytelling
this
week,
You
are
gonna
see
...very
messy,
lots
of
knots.
She
doesn't
like
to
brush
it.
That's
okay.
Her
name
is
Sarah.
Can
you
please
tell
her...
...that
Mama
found
her
red
shoe?
She
was
so
worried
about
that
shoe,
Matt.
But
it
was
just
right
under
the
bed.
Give
her...
...a
big
hug
and
a
big
kiss
for
me
You
tell
her
that
she
is
my
angel.
And
she
makes
me
so
proud.
So,
so
proud.
And
you
tell
her
that
I'm
not
quitting.
You
tell
her
that
I
love
her,
Matt.
You
tell
her
that
I
love
her
so
much.
Can
you
do
that
for
me?
Roger
that.
Here
we
go.
You're
losing
altitude,
Tiangong.
You
keep
dropping
But
not
without
me
Wait.
Five.
Four.
Three...
No
more
just
driving.
Let's
go
home.
Okay,
come
on.
Steady,
steady.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Agh!

Where
are
you?
Where
are
you?
One-eighty.
Agh!
Come
on.

Okay.
Damn
it.
Agh!

Agh!



Shit!

on.

Houston.
Aah!

Never--
Never
mind
the
story,
Houston.
It's
getting
hot
in
here.
Okay.
All
right.
Okay.
All
right,
the
way
I
see
it...
...there's
only
two
possible
outcomes.
Either
I
make
it
down
there
in
one
piece...
...and
I
have
one
hell
of
a
story
to
tell...
...or
I
burn
up
in
the
next
10
minutes.
Aah.
Either
way,
whichever
way...
...no
harm,
no
foul!
Aah!

Because
either
way...
...it'll
be
one
hell
of
a
ride.
I'm
ready.
