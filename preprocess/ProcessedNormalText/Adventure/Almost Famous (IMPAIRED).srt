I
saw
them
on
the
7th
floor.
Mr.
Jimmy
Page,
Mr.
Robert
Plant...
signed
my
T-shirt
He...
Please
don't
smear
it.
Oh,

But
five
minutes
ago,
-

Vic
is
a
Zeppelin
fan.
He
tours
with
them,
but
not,
Yeah,
uh,
they're
on
-


Very
dear,
very
close
William...
Miller...
Hey,
you're
that
comedian.
Blow
me!
Come
on,
William.
Okay,
time
to
put
on
Ladies
and
gentlemen!
At
this
time,
please
extinguish
for
the
captain

turned
on
Your
seats
and
tray
tables
should
be
Ee-yew!
-
The
hell
with
it!
-

Play
on.
Oh,
thank
you,
thank
you.
...
sooner
or
later
Because
the
revolution's
here
Act
One,
in
which
she
pretends
about
him.
Act
Two,
in
which
he
pretends
but
he
goes
right
for
her.
We
have
got
Act
Three,
in
which
the
way
she
planned
it.
-
She'll
eat
him
alive.
-
We've
got
to
stop
them.
You
were
her
excuse
-
I
need
ice.
-
Because
there's
somethin'
In
the
air
We've
got
to
get
together

I
worry
'Cause
she
brings
out
the
good
side
in
Because
the
revolution's
here
Life
kills
me.
-
And
you
know
it's
right
-
Do
you
smoke?
But,
uh,
I-I
grow
it.
Yeah.
Grow
it.
Funny...
Um,
funny...
if
you
were
only
taller
and
English
and
older.
I'd...
I'd
be
somebody
else.
Yeah.
Good
point.
The
Enemy.
I'm
always
around
-
Okay.
Bless
me,
Father,
-
How
does
it
end?
The
story
about
the
girl
who
dumps
Calls
her
a
hundred...
Okay,
five
times...
and
doesn't
even
leave
I
mean,
wake
up.
I'm
retired.
I
never
believed
you,
anyway.
You're
too
-
Everybody
knows
that.
Miss
Penny
Lane,
let
me
tell
you
the
day
that
you
truly
retire.
The
way
that
you
turn
The
way
that
you
pick
up
strays
The
way
that
you...
Every
song,
It's
mostly
the
bad
ones.
-
That
green
coat
in
the
middle
of
summer.
The
real
name

I
could
keep
goin',
Damn.

some
of
the
stuff
a
few
people

all
We
have
got
to
control
