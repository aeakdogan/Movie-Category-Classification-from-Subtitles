If
this
gets
more
exciting,
they're
Right,
Darrell.

Three
cars
are
tied
heading
into
the
final
race
And
the
winner
of
this
race
will
win
Does
The
King,
Strip
Weathers,
have
one
more
victory
in
him

He's
been
Dinoco's
golden
boy
Can
he
win
them
one
last
Piston
Cup?

And,
as
always,
in
the
He's
been
chasing

Chick
thought
His
chance
to
finally
emerge
But
the
last
thing
he
expected
was...

You
know,
I
don't
think
The
rookie
sensation
But
everyone
knows
him
now.

Will
he
be
the
first
rookie

The
legend,
the
runner-up,
Three
cars,
one
champion!

No
you
don't.
-

-

What
a
ride!

Go
get
'em,
McQueen!

I
love
you,
Lightning!
-
Dinoco
is
all
mine.

Trouble,
turn
three!
-
Get
through
that,
McQueen.

Wait
a
second,
Darrell.

There's
no
way
the
rookie
Not
in
one
piece,
that
is.

Yeah!
Lightning!
Oh!

Look
at
that!

A
spectacular
move
Yeah!
Ka-chow!
McQueen!
McQueen!
McQueen!
Yeah,
McQueen!
Ka-chow!


While
everyone
McQueen
stays
out
to
take
the
lead!
Don't
take
me
out,
coach.


What
do
you
think?
-
McQueen
made
it!
He's
not
pitting!
You
gotta
get
me
out
there!
McQueen's
not
going
into
the
pits!

The
rookie
fired
his

Says
he
likes
working
alone.
Looks
like
Chick
Yeah,
after
a
stop
like
that,
Get
ready,
boys,

Come
on,
come
on,
come
on!
We
need
tires
now!
-
No,
no,
no,
no!
No
tires,
just
gas!
You
need
tires,
you
idiot!

Looks
like
it's

Right.
No
tires
again.

That's
a
short-term
gain,
but
it's
workin'
for
him.
He
obviously


This
is
it,
Darrell.
One
lap
to
go
He's
got
it
in
the
bag.
We're
gonna
crown
us
a
new
champion!


-
Checkered
flag,
here
I
come!

No!
McQueen's
blown
a
tire!

And
with
only
one
turn
to
go!
-
You
fool!

McQueen's
blown
a
tire!
Go,
go,
go!
-


He's
lost
another
tire!

It's
too
close
to
call!
Too
close!
Lightning!
-
The
most
spectacular,
amazing...
...unequivocally,
unbelievable
ending

And
we
don't
know
who
won!

That's
very
close
to
call.
Hey,

Get
outta
here!
We're
here
in
Victory
Lane,
We're

was
a
risky
move,
Tell
me
about
it!
Are
you
sorry
you
didn't
have
Oh,
Kori.
There's
a
lot
more
to
racing
I
mean,
taking
the
race
by
a
full
lap...
I
wanted
to
give
folks
a
little
sizzle.
-
Sizzle?
No,
I'm
not.
What?
Oh,
yeah,
right.
That
was
a

Live

from
Swampscott.
He
was
so
rusty

You
could
see
his
dirty
undercarriage.

I
hate
rusty
cars.
They
did
give
you
your
big
break.
Oh,
will
you
stop,
please?

grand
old
time.

Wow.
You're

What
are
you
doin'?
Doc,
wait!

Giddup
right
in
there!
Doc,
hold
it!
-
Wonderful.
Now,
go
away.
-
I'm
askin'
you
to
leave.
I'm
a
racecar,
but
under
the
hood
We
are
not
the
same!
How
could
a
car
like
you
quit
You
think
I
quit?

Right.
Your
big
wreck
in
'54.
They
quit
on
me.
When
I
finally
got
put
together,
You
know
what
they
said?
Moved
right
on
to
There
was
a
lot
left
in
me.
I
never
got
a
chance
to
show
'em.
I
keep
that
to
remind
me
I
just
never
expected
that
...would
find
me
here.
-
Hey,
look,
Doc,
I'm
not
them.
No,
I'm
not.
When
is
the
last
time
you
cared
about
You
name
me
one
time
Uh-huh.
I
didn't
think
so.
These
are
good
folk
around
here,
I
don't
want
'em
depending
Oh,
like
you?
and
your
friends
Who's
caring
about
only
himself?
Just
finish
that
road



Will
you
turn
that

Respect
the
classics,
man.




Ah...

He's
done.
He
must've
finished
it
Good
riddance.
He's
gone?
Well,
we
wouldn't
want
him

-
Oh,
dude,
are
you
crying?
I
don't
have
to
watch
him
I'm
glad
he's
gone!

What's
wrong
with
Red?
Oh,
he's
just
sad
and
went
to
your
big
race
to
win
that
you've
always
dreamed
about
and
get
that
big
ol'
sponsor
and
that

Wait
a
minute!

I
knowed
you
wouldn't
leave
What
are
you
doin'
here?
Don't
worry.
I'll
give
you
Thank
you,
Sheriff.
But
you
know
I
can't
go
just
yet.
Well,
why
not?
-
I'm
not
sure
these
tires...
...can
get
me
to
California.
Yeah,
does
anybody
know

I
can't-a
believe
it!

I
can't-a
believe
it!
Grazie,
Mr.
Lightning.
Grazie!
-
Would
you
look
at
that!
I
am
filled
with
tears
of
ecstasy,
for
this
is
the
most
glorious
day
All
right,
Luigi,
give
me
No!
No,
no,
no.
You
don't-a
know
what
you
want.
Blackwall
tires.
But-a
this...
Whitewall
tires!
They
say,
"Look
at
me!
All
right,
you're
the
expert.
-

-
Perfetto.
Guido!


What
did
Luigi
tell
you,
eh?
Wow,
you
were
right.
Eh...
No.
Wow!
This
organic
fuel
is
great!
It's
a
conspiracy,
man!
The
oil
companies
got
a
grip
They're
feedin'
us
a
bunch
of
lies,
man.
OK,
I'll
take
a
case.
Ow!
Eh!

-


Ah...
Yeah.

Ka-chow.
-
Here
she
comes!
-
Act
natural.
-
Hi,
Sally.
All
right,
what's
goin'
on?
Ladies
and
gentlecars,
please
welcome
Pow!
What
do
you
think?
Radiator
Springs

I'll
say.

Ka-chow.
You're
gonna
fit
right
in
My
goodness.
It
looks
like
Yeah,
everybody
except
one.
-
Hey,
is
it
getting
dark
out?
Let
me
say
that
again.
Now,
what
was
I


They
fixed
their
neon!
-
Low
and
slow?

Just
like
in
its
heyday,
right?
It's
even
better
than
I
pictured
it.

Shall
we
cruise?
Oh,
thank
you,
dear.
I'd
love
to!
-
No,
no,
no.
I
remember
when
Stanley
Hey,
Miss
Sally.
-
Of
course,
Mater.

...and
again
and
I
said,
"No."
But,
oh,
he
was
a
persistent
Finally
I
said,
-
Oh!
-
Hey!
Good
evenin',
you
two.
Oh,
Stanley,
-
Is
that
what
I
think
it
is?
I
haven't
had
a
chance
to
find
out.
Not
that.
That.

Customers?

Customers?
Customers,
everybody!
You
know
what
to
do.

It's
the
ghostlight!
We
have
found
McQueen.
McQueen,
over
here!
-
Wait,
excuse
me.
-
Did
you
have
a
nervous
breakdown?
-
McQueen's
wearing
whitewalls!

Stickers!
-
Was
McQueen
your
prisoner?
We're
best
buds!
but
I
was
in
charge
of
huntin'
him
down
Sally!
Sally!
Will
you
still
race
for
the
Piston
Cup?
-
Stickers?
-
Come
on,
give
us
some
bolt!
You're
here!
-
Mack?

You
are
a
sight
I'm
so
sorry
I
lost
you,
boss.
Mack,
I,
I
can't
believe
you're
here.

Is

the
world's

Is
that
Harv?

Show
us
the
bolt!

Where's
the
old
McQueen?
-
Harv!
Harv!
-
Harv?

Kid,
I'm
over
here!
My
star
client
disappears
-
How
do
you
think
I'm
doing?
I'm
doing
great!
You're
everywhere!
You
can't
buy
this
kind
of
publicity!
That's
just
a
figure
of
speech,
Where
are
you?
I'm
in
this
little
town
-
You
know
Route
66?
It's
still
here!
Playtime
is
over,
pal.
While
the
world's
been
trying
to

Who
are
they
gonna
woo?
Bingo.
In
fact,
check
out

Show
us
the
thunder!
You
want
thunder?

Hey,

my
bit!
Just

out
of
Radiation
Stinks

Just
give
me
a
second
here,
Harv.
No,
wait.
Where
are
you
goin'?
Get

the
trailer,
baby.
Kid!
Sally,
I...
I
want
you
to...
Look,
I
wish...

Thank
you.
Thanks
for
everything.

-
It
was
just
a
road.
Hey,
kid!
We
gotta
go.
He's
gonna
have
me
fired
if

Mack,
just...
hold
it
for...

I
know,
but...
I
hope
you

Come

The

You're
a
big
shining
star.
You
don't
belong
there,
anyway.
Whoa...
Wait...

Hey,
guys!
Hey,

Doc
Hudson?
-
Yeah.

You
called
them?
Best
for
everyone
or
best
for
you?
I
didn't
get
to
say
goodbye
to
him.

McQueen
just
doesn't
have

all
right?
I
don't
think
I...

I
didn't
come
all
this
way
Doc?
Guys,
you're
here!
I
knew
you
needed
a
crew
chief,
You
said
you'd
never
come
back.
Well,
I
really
didn't
have
a
choice.
Goodbye!
OK,
I'm
good.

All

It's
just
an
empty
cup.

really
pushin'
him.
He's
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

one
thing.
Whoo-hoo!
