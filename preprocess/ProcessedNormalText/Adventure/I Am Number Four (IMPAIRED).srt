You

Yeah.

I

this
crap.

All
right,
let's
go.

Daniel.


This
is
the
part
But
it's
the
only
thing
The
rest
is
a
lie.
Even
Henri.
People
think
he's
my
father.
He's
not.
He's
a
warrior
from
my
planet,
I
don't
remember
my
father.
All
he
left
for
me
Henri
says
he'll
pass
it
on
to

I
got
my
first

near
the

It

The
second

I
was
in
Colorado,
As
soon
as
I
felt
it,
Last

I
got
my
third

I
was
just
a
kid
when
the
Mogadorians
Nine
of
us
children
escaped.
We
were
gifted,
meant
to
protect
We
never
got
the
chance.
We
are
the
last
of
our
kind.
Three
of
us
are
gone.
Dead.
They
are
hunting
us
down,
I
know
I'm
next.
I
am

school
OK.
You,

Your
new
ID.
And
this
time,
you
stay
out
of
sight,
John
Smith.
Very
original.
I
don't
want
to
be
original.
This
time
was
different.
I
didn't
just
get
a
scar.
I,
uh...
I
saw
Number
Three.
I
felt
the
knife,
I
felt
him
die.

That's
all
of
it.
Ooh.
Hang

We

What
are
you
gonna
call
him?
-
How
about
Bernie
Kosar?


-



What
are
you
doing
up?
-
I
changed
my
mind.
About
what?
Look,
uh,
as
much
fun
I
can't
be
a
prisoner.

No.
No
way,
too
risky.

Didn't
save
him.

I
promise
I'll
keep
a
low
profile.

Even
if
I

I'm

of
private,
actually.
It's
amazing.

You're
allowed

good
place.

dumb
dog.

Does
he
belong
to
you?

a
sec.
Um...
Your
turn.
Thanks.

I'm
fine.
Heard
you
made
quite
an
impression

It
was
a
dumb
prank.
-
Boring
as
hell?
Yeah.
Look,
I
know
it's
none
of
my
business,

What
do
you
mean?
Mark
James
and
his
man-tards
Sarah
may
act
like
one
of
us...
...she's
one
of
them.
He's
into
Sarah?
More
than
that.

They
were
like
the
town...
-

Whoa!

Loser!
No...
OK,
come
on...
-

Sucks
to
be
you,
bro!
-


I
wonder
who
did
that?

What
a
loser.
Leave
me
alone!
-


Did
you
have
a
nice
time
You
see,
in
football,
Speed,
strength...
Mostly,
though,
you
need
intuition.
A
feeling
when
things
First
time
we
talked,
-

-
Good
boy.
Maybe
you
got
some
intuition


That
was
awesome.
Raided
lost
and
found.
-
Nobody
loses
anything
cool.
Dude,
it
was
that
or
the
Hannah
-

...who's
in
the
picture?
The
real
one.


Where
was
that
taken?
Mexico.
The
Yucatn.
We
used
to
go
every
year
looking
Ancient
astronauts?
Yeah.
UFOs
and
shit.
Freak
show
stuff.
He
called
himself
an
anthropologist...
He
was
really
just
a
foreman

He
spent
all
his
time
preparing
I
used
to
think
he
was
a
genius.
Had
to,
I
guess.
Nobody
wants
to
admit

Sam...
Sam.
Oh!



Malcolm,
what
were
you
up
to
here?



-





Jimmy,
Vince,


-
Hey,
Sarah.
Mark
James
decided
to
fire
When
you
first
meet
somebody,
All
your
mistakes,
your
secrets?
Look,
Mark
and
I,
we
changed.
I
got
into
photography,
and
he
wanted
me
to
be
Said
I
was
becoming
a
total
snob.
And
when
we
broke
up,
That
I
was
a
total
bitch.
All
my
friends.
Uh...
I'm
sorry.

I'm
not.
I
mean,
I
was...
...but,
um,
I
don't
know,
I
kinda
look
at
it
like
a
total
gift.
Got
away
from
all
of
that.
So,
uh,
what's
the
hottest
attraction

You
gotta
be
kidding
me,
right?
Don't
be
scared.


-

Save
yourself.
-

-

-


Last
year,
she
was
drawn
and
quartered.
-
It
was
awesome.
-

-

-


Hell's
Gate.
Everybody
off.




-
Hm.
Small
town.
-



-
What
is
that?

-
Don't!
Let
him
go!
Let
him
go!
-
Stop
it!
Hello?

Was
that
real?
Are
you
all
right?

Let
me
go!
Stop
it!
-
Leave
him
alone!





-
No!
-
Oh,
my
God.
Just
get
off
me!
-
Idiot!
It's
you!
-

Let
go
of
me.
-
Let
go
of
me!
Let
go
of
me!
Sarah!
Where
is
she?

It
burns,
man!
Dude,
let
go
of
me,
bro,
it
hurts!
She's
at
Shepherd
Falls!
Where's
John?
I
don't
get
what
happened
to
us.
So
you
have
your
friend
drag
me
through
the
woods
when
all
you
had
to
do
is
ask
me!
You
don't
have
to
tell
me
But
you're
a
problem
for
me,
Sarah.
Yeah,
well,
you
really
-
Wait.
Sarah,
wait.

You
OK?

-

I
hope
you
can
throw

John.
John,
stop.
Wait.
Hey.
I
just
didn't
want
you
It's
not
you,
it's
me.
Hey.
Will
you
walk
me
home?
You
should
really
get
that
looked
at.
I
will.
I,
uh...
I
think
we
should
talk.
I
know.
It's
crazy.
Mark
is
insane.
And
this
is
our
last
year.
Who
knows
where
you'll
be

Exactly.
Who
knows?
So,
I
guess
I'll
just...
...see
you
when
I
see
you?
Yeah.
OK.
Your
hand's
really
warm.

All
I
think
about
is
you,
too.
Where
did
you
come
from?
All
right,
Mom!
I
got
it!
-
I,
uh...
Bye.




John!
In
here.
So,
what
are
you?
You
threw
those
football
players
And
the
hand
thing?
So
I'm
asking
you,
what
are
you?
Do
I
need
to
threaten
you?
All
right,
'cause
I
got
and
they're
gonna
start
-
Give
me
that.
You
know
I
can
hurt
you.
Hm?

Knock
yourself
out.
My
entire
childhood...
...has
been

episode
of
X-
Files.

know
what
it's
like

every
day
you
have
your
dad's
gonna
come
back
And
that
everything
And
that
we
were
not
crazy.
Please.
Please.
Your
dad
was
right.
What?
He
was
right.

About
ancient
astronauts...
...life
on
other
planets...
...all
of
it.
Yes!
I
knew...
I
knew
he
I
mean,
they
found
his
truck
near
the

Maybe
they
took
him.
If
he
knew
you
were
here,
-
You
can't
tell
anyone.
No,
no,
no.
You
gotta
promise
me.
There
are
others
from
where
I'm
from
I'm
not
safe.

Sam!
I
know
you
are
in
there.
Wait
until
I
get
inside
and
then
go.

I
promise.

Yes!

Come

course,
none
of
them
are
talking.

Your
son
is
Mark?
You
know,
that
was
his
He
said
you
were
there.
Uh,
no.
I
was
actually
with
a
girl.
So
I
wasn't
paying
any
attention.
Sarah
Hart?
Well,
no
one
wants
to
be
the
first
But,
eventually,
someone
will.
I'm
sure
you're
right.
If
we
hear
anything,
-
Four
of
them,
huh?
Was
it
difficult?
Piece
of
cake.
Good.
Means
you're
getting
it.
Go
upstairs,
pack
your
stuff.
Because
of
last
night?
Because
I
don't
like
people
-
And
I
think
this
is
gonna
raise
a
few.
What
is
this?
Some
more
Except
that's
actually
you.
One
of
the
kids
must
Oh,
shit.

I
can't
get
through
the
firewall.
We
have
to
go
there
Mogs
see
this,
just
a
matter
of
time.
Pack
your
stuff.
We're
leaving.
I'm
not
going.
I'm
sorry,
what
did
you
say?
I'm
not
going.
OK.
If
you
want
to
pick
It's
not
my
fight
and
it
never
was!
I
can't
even
remember
Wait,
wait...
...is
this
because
of
a
girl?
Go
upstairs
and
get
your
stuff.
-
You're
not
my
father.
He
died
for
you.
You
have
no
idea
how
many
others
And
it
wasn't
so
you
could
come
here
and
experience
puppy
love
I'm
not
leaving.
John...
John!
-
I'm
not
leaving!
-

Hey,
John!


I'm
letting
go,
OK?
-
OK?

-
On
our
planet...
The
Mogs,
they
don't
colonize.
And
now,
they've
moved
here.
There
are
few
forces
that
can
stop
them.
You
were
saved
for
a
bigger
purpose.
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
throw
that
away
She's
not
just
a
girl.
I
think
about
leaving
her...
...but
I
can't.
And
I
don't
know
why.

We
don't
love
like
the
humans.
You
never
forget.
If
she
is
that
for
you,
Or
you'll
never
forgive
yourself.
Now,
we
have
to
go.
I'll
take
care
of
the
website
tonight.
A
day?
To
say
goodbye?
That's
more
than
the
rest
of
us
had.

Henri,
I'm
going
to
Sarah's.
Henri?

Henri?
Hello?

gun?
I

it
from
Ed.

No.
You

Now,

What
are
you
doing?
What
if
these
Mog
people
took
my
dad?

But
you
just
dead-bolted
it.

OK.
New
plan.
You

that
guy
and
you
Copy

I'm
on
it.

it!
So

You're

You!
You're
the
one

The
one
they're
after.

What's
he
talking
about?

This
was
a
trap.
These
dudes,
whatever
they
are,
man,

John...
Nobody
gives
a
crap
what
I
say.

They're
gonna

this.

Malcolm
was
using
it
-

Wait.
So,
my
dad
was...
He
was
supposed
to
bring
us
together.
You
need
to
find
the
others.
Together
you'll
be
more
powerful.

I
can't
do
this
without
you.
Yes,
you
can.
Yes,
you
can.
You
have
no
idea
Henri.
Just
let
me
talk.
OK.
So,
I
called
you
like
you
said.
-
I
mean,
it's
not
my
fault
they
got...
I
mean,
we
held
up
our
end.

Hm.
The
whole
new
world
order
thing?

The
Locator.
-
Where
is
it?
All
he
had
was
a
knife
and
that
rock.
And
I
put
it...

It
was
over
there,
man.
But
it's
not
there
now.

to

after

You
brought

No,
it
was.

you
feel
that,
too?

We
know
