Listening
once
again
With
candy
canes
It's
beginning
to
look
a

Toys
in
every
store
But
the
prettiest
sight
to
see
Is
the
holly
that
will
be
KEVlN:
Hello?
DRlVER:
Hello.

Yes,

BACKGROUND
SlNGERS:

Christmas
Soon
the
bells
will
start
JOHNNY
MATHlS:
And
the
thing
Is
the
carol
that
you
sing
Right
within
your
heart
CONClERGE:
Bingo!
HARRY:
Get
out
of
here!
Beat
it!
Get
out
of
here!
Hey...Marv!
Get
over
here!
MARV:
Whoa!
Whoa!
Would
you
like
a
scarf?
Forget
the
scarf,
Marv.
We
don't
have
the
equipment
you
know,
your
banks,
We
don't
want
goods.
We
need
cash,
MARV:
How
about,
uh...
hotels?
Tourists
carry
lots
of
cash.
There's
no
guarantees.
I
got
a
better
idea.
Stores
don't
deposit
cash
The
only
stores
are
ones
that
deal
MARV:
Right...right.
HARRY:
What
stores
make
that
nobody's
going
to
think
Candy
stores.
Nine-year-olds
This
is
what
I
had
in
mind.
MARV:
That's
brilliant,
Harry.
Brilliant!
HARRY:
Yep.
to
knock
off
a
toy
store
Oh,
yes,
there
is.
DRlVER:
Here
we
are,
sir...
Duncan's
Toy
Chest.
Merry
Christmas,
Kevin.
This
is
the
greatest
accident
Marv.
Marv!
Hey,
nice
house,
MARV:
What's
the
plan?
HARRY:
Everybody
leaves
We
come
out
Yeah,
then
what?
We
empty
the
registers
and
Great
plan,
Harry!
MAN:
Shake
his
hand.
CASHlER:
Well,
now
thank
you
Say
hello
to
the
family.
Oh,
yes.
Let
me
see.
Eh...
You
shopping
alone?
In
New
York?
Sir,
I'm
afraid
CASHlER:
I
was
just
checking.
KEVlN:
CASHlER:
Oh,
well,
thank
you.
KEVlN:
My
pleasure.
CASHlER:
That'll
be
$23.75.
My,
my,
my!
Where
did
you
get
Uh...I
have
a
lot
CASHlER:
Oh.
Well,
that
explains
it.
This
is
a
really
nice
store--
one
of
the
finer
toy
dealerships
CASHlER:
Oh,
well,
thank
you.
KEVlN:
Mr.
Duncan
Ietting
all
the
kids
and
play
with
his
toys.
Most
toy
stores
prohibit
that.
-Oh,
is
that
so?
Well,
he
loves
kids.
As
a
matter
of
fact...
all
the
money
Mr.
Duncan
is
donating
it
and
the
day
after
Christmas...
we
empty
all
the
money
and
Mr.
Duncan
just
takes
it
That's
very
generous
of
him.
Well,
children
as
they
do
to
everyone
I'm
not
supposed
to
spend
but
I
have
twenty
dollars
in
a
jar
in
our
garage...
where
my
older
brother
So
I'll
pay
my
mother
back
You
can
give
this
The
hospital
Besides,
I'll
probably
that'll
rot
my
teeth
Aw...that's--
Eh...you
see
that
tree
there?
To
show
our
appreciation
I'm
going
to
let
you
select
that
you
can
take
home
with
you.
-Free?
CASHlER:
Eh...may--
KEVlN:
OK.
CASHlER:
Take
the
turtledoves.
I
could
have
two?
Well,
two
turtledoves.
I'll
tell
you
what
you
do.
You
keep
one...
and
you
give
the
other
one
You
see...
turtledoves
are
a
symbol
As
long
as
each
of
you
you'll
be
friends
forever.
Wow!
I
never
knew
that.
I
thought
they
were
They
are...
and--and
for
that
Wow!
Thanks.
Merry
Christmas.
Merry
Christmas

you,
too.
Be
sure
to
bundle

It's
a
little

All

HARRY:
Marv!
MARV:
What's
the
difference?
He's
not
going
to
talk
except
maybe
a
fish.
Or
the
undertaker.
HARRY:
Let's
just
get
him
I'll
feel
a
lot
better
HARRY:
You
open
your
mouth...
and
you'll
be
spitting
gum
Well,

-He

it.
Thanks.
HARRY:
Get

MARV:
He

MARV:
Hey,
Harry,
I

HARRY:
Put
him
down.
That
ain't
him.
We
should've
shot
him
I
hate
pulling
a
job
knowing
MARV:
What
can
he
do?
HARRY:
Not
this
kid.
MARV:
This
time,
of
dangerous
goodies
He's
in
the
park.
He's
alone.
Kids
are
a-scared
of
the
park.
HARRY:
Yeah.
and
don't
leave
alive.
MARV:
Yeah.
HARRY:
Good
luck,
little
fella.
KEVlN:
I
want

MAN:

New
York
City.
He's
in
New
York.
-New
York?
MAN:
He
checked
into
the
Plaza
I'm
sure
he
was
scared.
Would
you
hold
just
a
second?
He
used
your
credit
card
Do
they
still
have
him?
Do
they
have
him?
MAN:
Damn
it!
We're
on
the
next
flight
out.
We're
going
to
New
York.
-Yes!
He
ran
away
when

He
must
be
so
scared.
Would
he
go
Aren't
they
in
Paris?
Maybe
there's

said

did
all
you
come
from?
I
may
not
have
enough
How
hungry
are
you
guys?
Well,
you
guys
ate
all
my
food.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Look,
I'm
sorry
You
were
just
trying
I'm
Kevin
McCallister.
Your
birds
are
real
nice.
I've
seen
you
before.
You
had
pigeons
all
over
you.
At
first,
But
when
I
think
about
it,
They
must
be
all
over
you
If
I'm
bothering
you,
Am
I
bothering
you?
No.
Good.
No.
Will
those
pigeons
or
do
you
have
to
call
them?
WOMAN:
Give
me
your
hand.
They
can
hear
it.
This
is
great.
It's
pretty
cold
out.
I
could
sure
go
How
about
you?
My
treat.
KEVlN:
I'd
hate
to
spend
Can
we
go
someplace
warm?
WOMAN:
Yes.
I
know
a
place.

KEVlN:
Nice
music.
This
place
is
great.
WOMAN:
I've
heard
the
world's
Ella
Fitzgerald,
Count
Basie...
Frank
Sinatra...
Luciano
Pavarotti.
So,
do
you
bring
your
friends
I
haven't
got
many
friends.
Oh.
Sorry.
I'm
like
the
birds
I
care
for.
People
pass
me
in
the
street.
They
see
me,
They'd
prefer
Yeah.
It's
sorta
like
that
I'm
kinda
the
pigeon
just
because
I'm
the
youngest.
Everyone
fights
for
position.
Everybody
wants
to
be
seen...
and
heard.
I
guess
so.
I'm
seen
and
heard
but
then
I
get
sent
I
wasn't
always
like
this,
Oh.
What
were
you
like
before?
I
had
a
job...
I
had
a
home...
I
had
a
family.
Did
you
have
any
kids?
No.
Oh,
I
wanted
them...
but
the
man
I
loved...
fell
out
of
love
with
me.
That
broke
my
heart.
And
whenever
the
chance
I
ran
away
from
it.
I
stopped
trusting
people.
No
offense...
but
that
seems
like
I
was
afraid
of
getting
You
see,
sometimes
and
then,
they
forget
about
you.
Maybe
they're
just
too
busy.
Maybe
they
don't
but
they
forget
to
remember
you.
I
don't
think
people
I
think
it
just
happens.
My
grandfather
says
I'd
leave
it
on
the
school
bus.
I'm
just
afraid
I'll
get
my
heart
broken
again.
KEVlN:
I
understand
that.
I
used
to
have
a
really
nice
I
was
afraid
I'd
wreck
them...
so
I
kept
them
in
the
box.
-You
know
what
happened?
I
outgrew
them.
I
never
wore
them
once
just
in
my
room
A
person's
heart
are
very
different
than
skates.
Well,
they're
kind
If
you
aren't
going
then
what's
the
difference
If
you
just
keep
it
maybe
it'll
be
like
when
you
do
decide
to
try
it...
it
won't
be
any
good.
You
should
take
a
chance.
You
got
nothing
to
lose.
A
bit
of
truth
in
there
I
think
so.
Your
heart
but
it
isn't
gone.
If
it
was
gone,
Thank
you.
Do
you
know
that
it's
been...
a
couple
of
years
That's
OK.
You're
not
boring.
You
don't
mumble
or
spit
You
should
do
it
more
often.
You
just
have
to
wear
that
doesn't
have

Oh,
I
have
been
working
at
keeping
people
away,
I
always
think
I'll
have
but
being
alone
isn't
much
fun.
I
don't
care
how
much
I'd
rather
be
with
somebody
So
what
are
you
doing
on
Christmas
Eve
alone?
Did
you
get
into
trouble?
Yeah.
WOMAN:
A
lot
of
things.
Did
you
know
that
a
good
deed
It's
getting
pretty
late.
I
don't
know
to
erase
Well,
it's
Christmas
Eve.
Good
deeds
-They
do?
So
you
must
think
that
you
can
do
for
others...
and
go
and
do
it.
Just
follow
the
star
OK.
It's
getting
pretty
late.
I
better
get
going.
If
I
don't
see
you
again,
Thank
you.
Say
good-bye
to
your
birds
Oh,
I
will.
Merry
Christmas.
Merry
Christmas.
If
you
need
somebody
to
trust,
I
won't

to
remember
you.

You

Hospital.
OFFlCER:
DUNCAN:
Thank
you
very
much.
INSPECTOR:
I
found
this
note.
Looks
like
a
kid
Turtledoves.
Ohh.
KATE:
Oh,
excuse
me.
He's
this
boy
right
here.
Excuse
me.
Please
help
me.
This
boy
right
here,
This
one.
Please?
I'm
looking
for
my
son.
He's
been
missing
OFFlCER:
KATE:
Yes,
of
course
we
have.
Then
trust
us.
We'll
handle
it.
Oh.
But
I'm
his
mother.
I
realize
that,
ma'am...
but
you're
looking
Do
you
have
kids?
Yes,
ma'am.
And
what
would
you
do
I'd
probably
be
doing
Thank
you.
Look,
put
yourself
Where
would
you
go?
Me?
I'd
probably
be
lying
dead
Oh,
but
not
Kevin.
No.
Kevin
is
so
much
stronger
I
know
Kevin's
fine.
Fine.
But
he's
still
all
by
himself
and
he
doesn't
deserve
that.
He
deserves
to
be
at
home
around
his
Christmas
tree.
Oh,
dear
God.
I
know
where
he
is.
I
need
to
get
Hop
in.
Thank
you.
KEVlN:
I
know
I
don't
deserve
even
if
I
did
do
a
good
deed.
I
don't
want
any
presents.
Instead,
I
want
to
take
back...
every
mean
thing
even
if
they
don't
take
back
I
don't
care.
including
Buzz.
If
I
can
only
see
one,
I'll
never
want
another
thing
I
just
want
my
mother.
I
know
I
won't
see
her
but
promise
me
sometime,
anytime.
Even
if
it's
just
once
and
only
I
just
need
to
tell
her
Kevin?
Mom?
Wow.
That
worked
fast.
KATE:
Oh,
Kevin.
Mom,
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry,
too.
KEVlN:
Merry
Christmas,
Mom.
KATE:
Thank
you.
Let's
go.
KEVlN:
KATE:
I
know
you
and
this
is
the
biggest
around.
KEVlN:
Where's
everybody
else?
KATE:
They're
at
the
hotel.
They
didn't
like

Holy
smokes!
It's
morning!
It's
Christmas
morning,
man.
Fuller,
don't
get
your
hopes
up.
FULLER:
Huh?
I
don't
think
Are
you
nuts?
He's
omnipresent.
He
goes
everywhere.
Hey,
guys,
wake
up!
Mom,
Dad,
it's
Christmas!
FRANK:
What?!
GlRL:
What
on
earth?
JEFF:
Come
on.
I
wanna
find
out.
ROD:
Oh,
wow.
JEFF:
KEVlN:
-Gosh.
BUZZ:
Are
you
sure
-Look
at
all
this
stuff!
-Oh,
wow!
FRANK:
Don't
open
any
of
mine.
Who's
Mr.
Duncan?
KATE:
Duncan?
I
don't
know.
All
right.
Calm
down.
Hey,
hey!
All
right.
Now...
if
Kevin
hadn't
screwed
up
then
we
wouldn't
be
in
this
most
with
a
truckload
so...
I
think
it
only
fair...
that
Kevin
get
to
open
up
Then
I'll
go...
and
the
rest
of
you,
and
so
on.
Merry
Christmas,
Kev.
Merry
Christmas,
Buzz.
PETER:
Merry
Christmas,
Kevin.
FRANK:
OK,
Kevin!
All
right!
Merry
Christmas!
Enough
of
this
gooey
sh--
show...of
emotion.
Everyone,
let's
dig
in!
-All
right!
LESLlE:
Save
the
paper.
Give
me
the
bows.
Merry
Christmas.
Kevin!
Merry
Christmas!
I
got
something
for
you.
What's
this?
It's
a
turtledove.
I
have
one,
you
have
one.
As
long
as
we
each
we'll
be
friends
forever.
Oh,
Kevin.
Thank
you.
I
won't
forget
you.
Trust
me.
