my
bedroom
making
no
noise
and
pretending
I
don't
even

what
we
do

I

I,
Professor
Severus
Snape,
hereby
give
the

owing
to
the
need
to

nothing
to

but
wait
for
it
to
stop,I
am
afraid
Better
out
than

who's
he
tried
to
curse,
anyway?
Malfoy
he
called
Hermione
A...,
well,I
don't
know
exactly
what
it
means
he
called
me
mudblood
he
did
not
what's
mudblood?
it
means
dirty
blood
Mudblood's
a
really
foul
name
for
someone
who
is
Muggle-born
some
one
like
me
it's
sort
of
tongue
when
you
usually
hear
stuff
in
conversation
so
thing
is,
Harry
there
are
some
wizards
-
like
Malfoy's
family
who
think
they're
better
than
everyone
else
because
they're
what
people
call
pure-blood
it's
horrible
it's
disgusting
aren't
just
call
what
up
to
birth
dirty
blood,
there
is
no
wizard
alive

that
is
no

Harry,
Harry,

can
you
possibly
imagine?
a
better

a
lit
bit
drowsy?
Great

spooky,
how
the

flys
when
we're
having

spooky

Harry!
hear

voice?
what
voice?
I
heard
it
first
at
Lockhart
office,
then
again,
it
just
it's
moving
I
think
it's
gonna
kill
Harry,
wait,
don't
be
so
fast
strange
I've
never
seen
spiders
act
like
that
I
don't
like

what's
that?
the

has
been

been
petrified
ah,
Potter,so
unluck
I
wasn't
there
I
know
the
exact
the
countercurse
that
could've
spare
her
but
how
she's
been
petrified,
I
can
not
say
ask
him
he
must've
done
it,
you
saw
what
he
wrote
on
the
wall
it
is
not
true,
sir,
I
swear
I've
never
touch
Mrs.

rubbish
If
I
might,
Headmaster?
perhaps
Potter
and
his
friends
were
simply
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
however
the
circumstances
are
suspicious
I
am
afraid
that's
my
doing,
Severus
you
see,
Harry's
helping
answer
my
fan
mail
that's
why
Ron
and
I're
looking
for
him,professor
we
just

you
heard
the

the
voice
only
you
can
hear,
and
Mrs.Norris
turned
out

it's
just
strange
do
you
think
I
should've
told

I

are
you
mad?
no,Harry,
even
in

that

Mr.Weasley
yes,
Mrs
Granger
professor,
I
was
wondering
If
you
can
tell
us,about,the
chamber
of
secret
very
well,
you
all
knew,
of
course
Hogwart
was
founded
over
thousands
years
ago
by
the
four
greatest
wizards
and
witches
of
age
Godric
Gryffindor,
Helga
Hufflepuff,
Rowena
Ravenclaw,
and
Salazar
Slytherin.
three
of
the
founders
concensused
quite
harmoniously
one
did
not,
so
we
guess
it
is
who
Slytherin
wished
to
be
more
selective
about
the
students
admitted
to
Hogwarts.
He
believed
that
magical
learning
should
be
kept
within
all-magic
families.
in
another
words,
pure
blood
unable
to
persuade
others,
he
desided
to
leave
the
school
now,
according
to
legend
Slytherin
had
built
a
hidden
chamber
in
this
castle
known
as
the
chamber
of
secret
though
shockly,
before
departed,
he
sealed
it
until
that
time
when
his
own
true
heir
returned
to
the
school
the
heir
alone
will
be
able
to
open
the
chamber
and
unleash
the
horror
within,
and
by
so
doing
to
purge
the
school
of
all
those
who
in
Slytherin's
view

were
unworthy
to
study
magic.
muggleborn
Naturally,the
school
has
been
searched
many
times
no
such
chamber
has
been
found
professor
what's
exactly
the
legend
tell
us
the
light
in
the
chamber?
the
chamber
is
said
to
be
home
to
something
that
only
the
heir
of
Slytherin
can
control
it
is
said
to
be
the
home
of
a
monster
so
it
is
true,
she
told
us
there
is
really
a
chamber
of
secret
yes,
could
you
tell?
McGonagall's
worried
and
all
the
teachers
are
and
if
there
is
really
a
chamber
of
secret
and
really
hasn't
been
opened
that
means,
the
question
is,
who
is
it?
who
thinks
all
muggleborns
are
scums
of
course,
you
heard
him
but,Malfoy,
the
Heir
of
Slytherin?
maybe
Ron
is
right,
Hermione
I
mean,
look
at
his
family,The
whole
lot
Crabbe
and
Goyle
must
know,maybe
we
can
trick
him
to
tell
them
even
they
aren't
that
pig,
but
there
might
be
another
way
remind
you,
it
would
be
difficult
not
mention
we'll
break
about
50
school
rules
and
it'll
be
dangerous
very
dangerous
here
it
is
Polyjuice
Potion.
properly
brewed
Polyjuice
Potion
allows
the
drinker
to
transform
himself
temporaly
into
phisical
form
of
other
here,you
know,if
Harry
and
I
drink
that
stuff
we'll
turn
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
yes
Malfoy'll
tell
us
anything
exactly
but
truth
is
I've
never
see
a
more
complicated
potion
eh,
well,
how
long
will
it
take
to
make?
a
month
a
month
but,
Hermione,
if
Malfoy
is
the
heir
of
Slytherin,
he
could've
attacked
half
muggleborns
in
the
school
by
then
I
know
but
it's
the
only
plan
we
got
another
ball
for
Slytherin

this
won't

a
bit
BRAKYAMY
IMENDO
ah,yes,
well,
that
can
sometimes
happen
but
the
point
is
you
can
no
longer
feel
any
pain
and
very
clearly,
the
bones
are
not
broken
broken?
there
is
no
bones
left

oh,
Mr

I
will
make
things
as
fast
as
you
can
go
out

out

You
should
have
come
straight
to
me!
You
will
be
able
to,
won't
you?
I'll
be
able
to,
certainly,
but
it
will
be
painful
You're
in
for
a
rough
night,

regrowing

is
a
nasty
bussiness
what

Harry

Dobby
Harry

gone

he
missed
the

it
was
you,You
stopped
the

from
letting
Ron
and
me
through!
Indeed,
yes,
sir
you
nearly
got
Ron
and
me
expelled
at
least
you
would
be
away
from
here
Harry
Potter
must
go
home
Dobby
thought
his
Bludger
would
be
enough
to
make
Harry

see
the...
Dobby
feels
the
most
grief,
sir
Dobby
had
to
iron
his
hands
You'd
better
clear
off
before
my
bones
come
back,
Dobby,
or
I
might
strangle
you.
Dobby
is
used
to
death
threats,
sir.
Dobby

them
five
times
a

I
don't

you
could
tell

listen,
listen,
terrible
thing
is
about
to
happen
in
Hogwart
Harry

must
not

here
Now,
that
history
is
to
repeat
itself
repeat
itself,
you
mean
this'
happened
before?
eh--I
shouldn't
have
said
that
bad
Dobby
stop,
stop,
Dobby
tell
me,
Dobby
when
did
this
happen

who
is
doing
it

Dobby
can
not

sir
Dobby
only
want
Harry

to
be
safe
no,
Dobby,
tell
me,
who
is
it?
put
him
here
what
happened?
there's
been
another
attack
I
think,
do
you
know,I
think
he's
been
petrified,Madam
Pomfrey.
perhaps
he
managed
to
get
a
picture
of
his
attacker?
What
can
this
mean,
Albus?
it
means
our
students
are
in
great
danger
what
you
have
to
tell
the
staff?
the
truth,
tell
them,
the
Hogwart
is
no
longer
safe
it
is
as
we
feared,

that
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
has
indeed
been
opened
again.
again?
you
mean
the
chamber
of
secret
had
been
opened
before?
of
course
don't
you
see?
Lucius
Malfoy
must've
opened
the
Chamber
when
he
was
at
school
here
now
he's
told
Draco
how
to
do
it
maybe,
but
we
have
to
wait
Polyjuice
potion
to
make
sure
and
why
it's
me,why
are
we
brewing
this
potion
in

do
you

is

an
excellent
idea
to
show
them
that,Professor
Snape,
but
if
you
don't
mind
my
saying
it
was
pretty
obvious
what
you
were
about
to
do.
If
I
had
wanted
to
stop
you
it
would
have
been
only
too
easy
perhaps
it
would
be
prudent
