Well,
it's
obviously

inadequacy.
Good
thing
Reed,
what
are
we
doing
here?
This
wasn't
our
first
stop,
Besides,
Victor's
not
that
bad.
-
Hi,
Reed
Richards
and
Ben
Grimm-
What's
it
take
to
get

of
aerospace
technology
The
unparalleled
leader

that
exposure
to
borne
might
have
triggered
the
evolution
In
six
weeks
In
six
weeks
another
cloud...
with
the
same
elemental
profile...
will
pass
Earth's
orbit.
A
study,
conducted
in
space...
could
fundamentally
advance
about
the
structure
cure
countless
diseases,
give
kids
a
chance
to
live
longer,
Turn
it
offPlease
-
I
don't
think
I've
explained
my
proposal
fully.
Same
old
Reed-
always
stretching,
with
the
weight
of
the
world
But
dreams
don't
pay
the
bills,
You
remember,
we
talked
about
working
together.
Well,
that's
what
The
storm
is
deadly
but
the
shields
are
designed
to
protect
So,
it's
not
just
my
money
you
want.
Tell
me,
if
NASA
doesn't
trust
you,
That's
my
job-
to
know
what
other
men
don't.
-
I
can't
take
this.
He's
right,
Ben-
I
think
you
both
know
Susan
Storm
One
more
thing
he's
got.
-
Hey,
Susie
Oh,
it's
so
nice
to
see
you.
-
Great.
-
Uh,
how
have
you
been?
-
This
isn't
gonna
be
a
problem,
is
it?
-
No,
l-
Then
you
are
just
in
time...
to
hear
the
great
Reed
Richards...
ask
me
for
help.
You
made
a
lot
of
folks
at
M.I.T.
so
you'll
excuse
me
You
back
this
mission...
and
I'll
sign
over
a
fair
percentage
The
number
is
75,
-
What
about
his
firstborn?

Twenty-five
percent
of
a
billion
is
enough
Maybe
even
pay
off
your
fourth
mortgage
Deal?
Well,
then,
to
our
future.
Together.
It's
funny
how
things
turn
out,
Hilarious.
He
knew
about
NASA.
Ben,
think
about
all
the
people
Look,
we
got
what
we
wanted.
A
few
days
in
space.
It'll
be
great.
If
Reed's
right,
this
little
trip
And
if
he's
not?
Reed's
always
right.
Good
thing
he
doesn't
always
know

Reed,
you
should
know
those
solar
winds
-
I
factored
them
into
my
coordinates.
Of
course
you
did.
-
It's
a
little
different
once
you're
out
there.
When
are
we
leaving?
I'll
be
scheduling
the
launch.
You
can
call
me
in
the
morning
-
I
think
I
remember
the
number.

I
was
hoping
Ben
We
already
have
a
pilot
But
you're
welcome
to
ride
shotgun.

External
S.R.B.'s,
-
It's
just
like
the
shuttle
you
flew-
-
I
cannot
take
orders
from
the
underwear
model.
That
wingnut
washed
out
of
NASA
for
into
a
flight
simulator.
-
Youthful
high
spirits.
A
flight
simulator.
When
have
I
ever
asked
you
to
do
something
Five
times.
-
I
had
it
at
four.

Commencing

Digital

$254.
Memory
stick-
$59.
The
look
on
your
hard-ass
when
he
finds
out
he's
-

I
can
handle
this
ship.
I
can
even
handle
But
I
don't
know
if
I
should
be
flying
Who
the
hell
came
up
with
these?
Victor
did.
The
synthetics
act
as
a
second
skin,
See,
now
that
means
it
keeps
Wow.
Fantastic.
Material
made
from
self-regulating,
I've
been
working
on
Great
minds
think
alike.
-
Here
you
go,
Ben.
Reed

If
you're
good,
maybe
next
time
You
keep
talkin',
Long
way
at
the
Hayden
Planetarium,
Yes.
Yes,
it
is.
We
can
monitor
the
cloud's
approach
Is
it
safe?
The
shields
on
the
station
-
"Should"?
Getting
paranoid
in
your
old
age?
Let's
start
loading
those
samples.
So
I
see
you're
still
doing
Maybe
you
should
have
stayed
in
the
lab.
He
does
the
talkin'.
So,
take
a
walk,
Ben.
Actually,
if
you'll
all
excuse
me,
for
a
moment
Sure.
Please
tell
me
your
guy's
not
trying
Of
course
not.
Yes,
well,
his
eyes
Hey.
Two
hearts
Maybe
she's
not
over
it
either.
Wow,
Dr.
Phil,
that's
deep.
Let's
think
about
that.
You
got
Victor-
and
you
got
Reed,
worth
less
than
a
postage
stamp.
That's
a
real
toss-up.
Don't
trouble
your
tiny
little
mind.
Don't
wander
off
now,
boy.
-

Surprised
I
agreed
to
Reed's
proposal?
I
understand
the
business
reasons.
Well,
when
you're
it
doesn't
hurt
Susan,
every
man
dreams
he'll
meet
In
my
case,



That
can't
be
right.

Event
threshold

That's
impossible
We've
been
together
It's
been
a
good
two
years,
Victor.
The
company's
accomplished
so
much.
Right.
Of
course.
The
company.
But
I've
come
to
realize...
that
all
the
accomplishments
in
the
world
-
Um-
-
Now
it's
time
to
take
the
biggest
step
of
all.
If
it
helps,
Victor,
l-
I
have
four
words.
Four
little
words
that
can
change

We've
got
minutes
until
it
hits,
-
Victor,
that
storm
is
deadly
We
need
to
abort
We
didn't
come
all
this
way
to
lose
our
nerve
-
Ben
is
still
out
there.
We
came
here
to
do
a
job,
Victor,
Reed's
right.
-
Ben,
get
inside
now!
I
ain't
done
arrangin'

-

Guys,
I'm
not
gonna
make
it.
It's
the
only
way!
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
You
can't
just
leave
them
out
there.
You
can't
help
them
I
can
try.
Come
on,
Ben!
You
got
this!
Johnny,
get
ready
to
close
the
portal.



-


-
You
okay?
-
You
okay?
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!

Wake
up
Ben
Hey,
rise
and
shine,
big
boy.
-

Where
am
I?
We're
in
quarantine.
Reed?
Sue?
Oh,
they're
fine.
What's
wrong
with
me?
I
swear
to
you,
Ben,
they've
done
The
best
plastic
surgeons
in
the
world
-
Give
me
that
mirror
-
They
said
the
shock
alone-
Okay,
Ben.
Unfortunately,
the
doctors
just
Unfortunately,
the
doctors
just

Hey.
Nice
do.

What?

You've
been
charged


Danger
is
always
part
of
this
-
How's
she
doing?
And
her
vitals
are
strong.
Blood
panels
show
no
irradiation.
-
You'll
step
up
this
protocol-
We
know
what
we're
doing.
-
Another
day
of
observation,
and
you're
all
clear.

She's
allergic
to
orchids.
They're
her
favorites

Well,
Victor
the
bank
would
like
on
the
fastest
free-fall
-
We
can't
even
give
your
stock
away.
You're
going
to
have
to,
Victor,
-
You
have
a
week.
One
week.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa
I
don't
know
if
we've
noticed,
but
the
sickest
Yeah,
I've
noticed.
But
there
are
rules
here.
Until
we've
finished
the
tests.
I
know.
You
let
me
know
-
Do
you
wanna
help
me
with
the
zipper?
Not
yet.
Luckily,
Grandma
still
sends
care
packages.
-
For
an
80-year-old
woman,
you'd
be
surpri-
Mmm
"Trouble"is
my
middle
name
-
Oh,
you're
hot.
-
And
I'm
not
afraid
to
cry.
I've
never
felt
better
in
my
life.
-
When
do
you
get
off
work?
Tell
you
what.
You
meet
me
at
4:01
That'll
give
you
This
is
yours.
That's
mine.


How
long
was
I
out?
Hey.
Three
days.
I
was
worried
about
you.
Solid.
Uh,
it
was
a
close
one,
though,
huh?
I
don't
know.
I
really
don't
know.
I've
been
going
over
the
figures
again
and
again,
I
just
don't
understand.
Reed,
it
was
a
freak
of
nature.
-
Let
it
go.
You
know,
you
live
through
it
really
makes
you
appreciate
-
Yeah,
you
and
Debbie
are
perfect.
What?
Come
on.
She's
got
a
good
thing
with
Victor.
-
He's
smart,
he's
powerful,
he's
successful-
Ben,
she
ended
up
Things
worked
out
for
the
best.
Do
I
have
to
do
everything
myself?
##
##
You
should
stay
to
the
right.
-
I
think
we
should
drop,
like,
10
more
feet.
Last
one
down
Whoo-hoo!
##
My
future
wife!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
You're
losing!
All
right,
no
more
kid
stuff.
Check
this
out!
##
-
You're
on
fire!
No!
You're
on
fire!
Look!
##
-
Whoa!



Whoa-ohh!
Care
to
join
me?
I
can
only
stay
for
one
drink.
Oh.
Wouldn't
want
Reed,
what
are
you
doing
here?
I
thought-
Great!
-
How's
the
IPO
now?
We're
looking
at
low
20s.
From
Reed's
disaster?
Get
me
on
the
am
shows,
Gonna
have
to
do
something
Make
sure
they
only
shoot
me
Actually,
uh,
the
scar's
tracking
well.
People
seem
to
think


Maybe
you
should
get
some
rest.
Later.
First
I
have
some
unfinished
business.
A
deal
that
needs
closing.
Sir,
I
have
always
wondered-
You
could
have
any
other
woman
That's
why.
Because
I
could
-

-


-

-


I
think
I'd
better
go
lie
down.
Excuse
me.





Yes.
Thank
you.
Good.
That's,
uh,
good.
You
always
had
a
way
with
words.
Uh-Wow.
I
should
be
going,
'cause,
uh...
I
have
to
meet
Victor.
I'm
really
happy
for
you
and
Victor.
You're
really
happy
I
can
tell
you
guys
are
enjoying
-
Which
was?
For
science.
You
are
such
a
dork,
Reed.
You
never
got
it,
-
What
did
I
say?
I
just
wanted
It's
been
two
years,
and
all
you
can
say
Victor
may
be
a
lot
of
things
but
at
least
he's
not
afraid
It's
nice
to
be
wanted
to
be
seen
and
heard.
Look
at
me.
I
can't.
-
What
do
you
mean,
you
can't?
Look
at
me!


Hey!
You
guys-
Hey.
You
are
never
gonna
believe
What?
Oh.
Well,
I
can
explain
this.


It
has
to
be
the
cloud.
Let's
not
jump
to
conclusions.
We
need
a
massive
amount
of
evidence
Whoa!
Guys,
look

Now,
picture
that,
but
everywhere!
It
was
everywhere!
What?
The
cloud
has
fundamentally

-
And
you
know
what,
guys?
I
think
I
was
flying.
-

-

I
said
cut
it
out,
Johnny.
-
Still
getting
the
hang
of
it.
-
Stop.
-
All
right?
-
God!
What's
wrong
with
you?
-
Sue,
do
you
know
the
code?
Hey,
Ben!
Open
up!
-
You
all
right,
Ben?

Just
break
the
glass


That's
gross.



Look!
Look,
look,
look,
look!
What
is
that
thing?
What's
going
on?
-
Are
you
feeling
all
right?
Ben
did
this
He's
had
some
kind
of
We
all
have,
um,
different
symptoms
Symptoms?
-
Victor,
um,
I
should
have-
Anybody
got
any
ideas


-


-


-

Little
buttons!
Hello,
Operator?

-

Hello?
Ben?
Are
you
all
right?
-
Uh,
listen,
I
need
you
to
come
out
front.
-
You're
home,
baby?
-
Yeah.
I
got
a
surprise
for
you.

Yeah,
I
got
a
little
one
for
you
too.
Ben?
Where
are
you?
I'm
over
here.
Don't
come
any
closer
for
a
sec,
okay?
It's
gonna-
Honey,
what's
going
on?
Debs...
remember
w-when
we
used
to
say...
together
forever,
Yeah?
Baby,
you're
scaring
me.
-
Oh,
my
God.
It's
me.
It's
still
me.
-
Let
me
explain.
-
Debs!

Hey!
I'm
callin'the
police!

-

I
saw
him!
It's
that
guy
over
there!


Oh,
yeah,
Ben.
What's
the
worst
that
could
happen?
Hey,
little
guy.



Thanks.

-

-

Huh.
How
bad
could
it
be,
right?
-
I
don't
think
you-

No,
no,
no.
Don't
go
out
there.
No,
no,
no.
Come
closer.
That's
further!
Come
closer!
I
said
stop!
No,
no,
no!
Whoa!



Whoa!
-


-

Calm
down.
You
wanna
be
scared?

-

-
Give
me
a
couple
tow
trucks.
Get
back
in
your
vehicles!
-
What
are
we
gonna
do
now?
But
you
could.

Sorry
about
the
truck,
pal.
A
little
help
here
-
Stuck.
Sue,
your
clothes.
Lose
them.
Oh.
Right.
This
is
so
wrong.
-


-
Wow.
You've
been
working
out.
All
right.
All
right,
freeze!
Now,
just,
uh-
just
put
the
man
Do
it!
Any
more
great
ideas?
Why
don't
you
strip
-
Sue
Oh.
Hmph!
I'm
gonna
need
therapy.
Come
on.
-
Excuse
me
Coming
through
Right
now,
uh,
And,
uh,
I
want
you
to
put
your
hands

954
approaching
scene.
-
I
still
can't
believe
you
made
me
do
that.
Just
find
Ben.
-
Stay
back
of
the
bridge!
Ben!
Ben!
Mom!
Mom?


-
Whoa!

-
Stay
here,
okay?
Coming!
Hold
on!
-

-

No,
you-
-

Don't.
-
No!



-
Hang
on!

-
Huh?



This
is
the
police!

-
Get
down
on
the
ground
now!
-

Whoo-hoo!
I
swear
to
you...
I
will
do
everything
in
my
power...
until
there
is
not
a
breath
left
in
me-
You're
gonna
be
Ben
again.
-
How
'bout
this
guy?
I
tell
you
what-
I
told
you
I
felt
fine.
Where
are
your
ears?
-
There
are
some
folks
outside
-
We're
scientists,
not
celebrities.
Look.
-
When
a
New
York
Fire
Department
ladder
truck...
Became
part
of
the
tragedy.
But
the
rescue
itself
is
not
the
story
One
of
the
four
stretched
That's
what
they're
calling
you-
-
Cool!
-
I'm
gonna
go
talk
to
'em.
-
We
should
think
this
through.
Where
is
it?
Left?

-
Settle
down!
Do
you
believe
this?
-
Which
one
of
you
is
the
leader?
No,
seriously.
Okay,
son,
you're
on.
Uh...
during
our
recent
mission
we
were
exposed
to
-
What
happened
on
the
bridge?
-
Is
it
true
you
can
fly?
No,
actually,
we
do
not
know
Uh,
sir,
Larry
King
just
canceled.
Apparently
there's
a
bigger
story.
NASDAQ
was
up
9.9-
Bravest-
You
had
to
see
it
named
the
Fantastic
Four-
We
will
be
going
directly
to
our
lab

No!
No,
no,
no.
Symptoms?
If
having
special
powers
Excuse
me.
Ben
Grimm
is
a
genuine
American
hero.
What
he
means
is,
-

The
day
of
the
Fantastic
Four!

Look-
Look,
we
went
up
to
space
Cure
disease,
save
lives
Well,
now
it's
our
D.N.A.,
Thank
you.
This
is
how
you
turn
things
around?
These
freaks
on
the
front
page...
your
company's
in
the
obituaries?
-
I
was
planning
to
use
the
publicity-
-
The
bank's
lost
enough
already.
It's
too
late,
Victor.
Do
you
know
how
much
money
Victor,
stop.
It's
a
notification
We're
pulling
out

Is
all
that
for
you,
Dr.
Richards?
I'm
afraid
so.
Come
on,
Ben.
Smile.

Uh,
don't
do
drugs!

-

Welcome
back
to
the
Baxter,
I've
got
the
usual
for
you.
-
Good
to
have
you
back,
sir.
We
had
a
tough
year.
Yeah,
like,
nine
straight.
-



Either
we're
moving



I'll
take
the
stairs.

How
come
Ben
can't
turn
it
That's
what
we're
here
to
find
out.
-
If
it
happened
to
him-
-
That
would
save
time.
Ha!
-
Is
that
a
trick
question?
Come
on.
Am
I
the
only
guy
We
should
stay
here
until
we
can
and
figure
out
how
to
reverse
them.
Whoa.


But
I
have
to
warn
you,

So,
what
do
you
think?
I
don't
know,
Reed.
I
think
you
might
be
bringing

Come
on.
Let
me
show
Busy
guy.

-
Hi,
everybody.
Would
you
like
to
comment

God,
I
was
so
worried
about
you
Victor
-
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
call.
No
apologies
I've
arranged
for
your
things
-
You'll
have
round-the-clock
care.
That's
very
generous
of
you,
but
I
think
until
we
get
a
handle
on
things.
Susan,
I
think
you
should

What
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
starting
to
wonder
-
How
much
do
you
know
-
We
need
to
run
tests
We're
all
in
this
together
now.
Victor,
wait
I
just
wanted
to
say
I'm
sorry
Didn't
go
as
planned?
It
was
a
catastrophe
With
all
due
respect,
we're
both
to
blame.
Abort?
I
put
my
company,
my
name,
-
I
will
not
let
you
make
me
look
like
a
fool.
I
don't
want
to
understand
it!
I
just
want
to
fix
it,
fast!

Just
pay
your
damn
electric
bill

Whoa!
Wow!
He's
heating
up
from
his
core.
And
his
vitals
are
completely
normal
If
we're
going
to
identify
we
need
to
isolate
So
we
can
activate

Huh?
Oh.
Why
didn't
you
just
say
so?


How
bad
is
it?


You
should
be
able
to
bend
light
if
you
could
control

Excuse
me?
Can
you
remember
Anger.
Rage.
Frustration.
Okay,
is
there
any
way
to
duplicate
I'm
sure
I
can
-
You
feel
anything?
Okay.

It's
hotter
than
I
anticipated.
-
Johnny,
back
it
down.


Johnny!
-


Buzz-kill!
You
guys
are
crampin'my
style!
Johnny,
you
were
at
4,000
Kelvin.
-
Any
hotter,
and
you're
approaching
supernova.
No,
not
sweet.
Not
only
could
you
kill
yourself.
But
you
could
set
fire
to
Earth's
atmosphere
Got
it.
Supernova-
bad.
How's
that
coming?
Oh,
I'm
so
sorry.
-
Are
you
okay?
-
You
sure?
I,
um-
You
probably
thought
that
was
What
in
the
world
I
mean,
you
broke
up
with
me,
right?
-

Are
you
kidding?
I
distinctly
remember
I
was
ready
for
the
next
step.
It
was
a
little
more
complicated
I
just
wanted
What
was
so
complicated
about
that?
-
There
were
a
lot
of
variables
to
consider.
There
was
you
and
me.
No
variables,
no
math.
-
But
like
always,
Reed,
your
head
got
in
the
way.
Then
what
was
it?
Did
you
feel
anything
when
I
left?
Do
you
feel
anything
right
now?

I
think
we
have
a
serious
problem.
Thank
you.
-
How
are
you
feeling?
Thank
you
for
-
You
said
it
was
urgent,
so-
There's,
uh,
something
Something
I
need
Victor,
wait
a
second.
Um,
I
appreciate
-
but
I
think
it's
a
bad
What
are
you
doing?

talk
about
us.
Please,
this
is
business.

I
need
to
know,
how
close
is
Reed
He's
been
working
-
The
data
needs
to
be
All
analysis,
no
action.
Wasn't
that
the
problem
If
the
molecules
aren't
stable,
it
could
Then
why
is
Reed
Maybe
he
likes
having
It's
ironic,
You're
finally
the
perfect
woman
for
him

Please
don't
make
this
a
personal
matter.
Victor,
we
can't
do
anything

Johnny,
