NARRATOR:
The
oldest
stories
ever
told
Stories
of
time
before
man
and
gods,
The
Titans
were
powerful...
...but
their
reign
was
ended
...Zeus,
Poseidon
and
Hades.
Zeus
convinced
his
brother
Hades...
...to
create
a
beast
so
strong
And
from
his
own
flesh...
...Hades
gave
birth
...the
Kraken.
Zeus
became
king
of
the
heavens.
Poseidon,
king
of
the
seas.
And
Hades,
tricked
by
Zeus...
...was
left
to
rule
the
underworld
It
was
Zeus
who
created
man...
...and
man's
prayers
But
in
time,
mankind
grew
restless.
They
began
to
question
the
gods...
...and,
finally,
rise
up
against
them.
Into
this
world,
a
child
was
born.
A
boy
who
would
change
everything.

Shh.
Shh.
Perseus.
What
is
it,
son?
I'll
have
a
brother
or
a
sister
soon.
Think
we're
gonna
love
this
child
differently
This
child
will
be
yours.
Me...
...I'm
no
one's
son.
I
am
your
father,
Perseus.
And
you'll
always
be
our
son.
The
bond
between
us
The
love
we
have
for
you...
...it's
that
love
that
gods
and
kings
I've
never
understood
the
gods.
But
even
I
don't
question
And
some
day...
...that
reason
is
gonna
take
you
But
not
tonight,
eh?
SPYROS:
Getting
frail,
old
man.
Marmara!
Marmara!
Another
day,
nothing.
Caught
on
the
reef.
To
whom
do
I
direct
our
gratitude
Spyros,
please.
Poseidon,
Zeus?
-
Thank
the
men
who
provoke
them.
They
put
a
plague
on
yours.
They
take
from
us
what
they
want.
The
gods
gave
us
life.
-
For
that,
we
should
be
thankful.
I'm
a
fisherman.
Perseus
is
a
fisherman.
They've
even
taken
that
away
from
us.
Still
they
want
us
to
love
them
anyway.
One
day...
...somebody's
gonna
have
to
One
day,
somebody's
gonna
have
to
say:
"Enough.
"

Just
like
the
day
you
came
to
me.
The
storm
brought
me
right
to
you.
I
know
you
have
questions,
son.
I
wish
I
had
the
answers.
I
have
everything
I
need...
...right
here.
Good
night,
son.
PERSEUS:
Tekla,
the
wreath.
Fetch
the
wreath.
SPYROS:
Something
isn't
right.
The
soldiers,
what
are
they
doing?

MAN

PERSEUS:

MAN
3:
Who
are
they?
Soldiers
from
Argos.
MARMARA:
SPYROS:
They've

war.


-
Let's
turn
the
boat
around.
Do
nothing.
MAN
4:

PERSEUS:
MARMARA:
SPYROS:
Tekla!
No!
SPYROS:
Go!


No!
MAN
1:
Zeus,
you
must
bring
an
end
MAN
2:
WOMAN:
MAN
3:
An
accommodation
could
be
made.
No!
I
created
them...
...and
they
reward
my
love
with
defiance?
There
will
be
no
truce.
HADES:
Some
rage
from
you.
How
long
has
it
been?
How
long,
brother...
...since
you've
seen
my
face?
Hades.
Endless
years,
...and
saw
your
wrath
You
created
them
for
one
reason...
...so
their
prayers
But
you
love
them
too
well.
They've
grown
strong.
And
now
I
am
forced
to
rise
What
do
you
want,
brother?
Let
me
loose
upon
them.
They
will
pray
again...
...and
you
will
bathe
in
their
awe
And
we
will
grow
strong
again.
He
belongs
in
the
underworld,
not
here.
You
do
not
tell
me
where
I
belong.
You
say
it
is
love
that
feeds
us.
But
you
depend
on
their
love.
I've
only
learned
to
live
on
their
fear...
...their
pain.
Zeus,
our
brother
speaks
the
truth.
Go.
Do
what
you
will.
Father,
we
need
the
mortals.
ZEUS:
Hades
is
right.
Their
insolence
has
a
price.
Like
children,
they
need
to
be
Set
an
example,
brother.
Turn
them
on
each
other...
...and
back
into
our
arms.
-
Are
we
the
last
boat
to
come
in?
You're
the
only
one.
Is
he
one
of
ours?
No.
We
found
him
off
Paxos
He
was
the
only
survivor.
Let
the
palace
figure
out

MAN
4:
...they
shall
show
us
love
in
return.
They
gave
us
the
corn
in
the
fields,
These
are
all
gifts
given
to
us.
Gifts
can
be
taken
away.
...if
we
do
not
pay
love
to
our
gods.
If
we
do
not,
we
stay
in
filth
and
misery,
MAN
5:
Move.
Out
of
the
way.
The
beauty
and
clarity
of
servitude.
Man
cannot
rule
man.
You
defy
the
gods


Is
this
all
there
is?
GENERAL:
...but
we
have
victory.
To
King
Kepheus!
To
Queen
Cassiopeia!

No.
To
you...
...our
mighty
legion.
Our
heroes
who
have
dared

The
temples
are
burning.
The
statues
have
fallen.
We
have
starved
them
of
our
prayers.
Tonight...
...after
a
generation
of
struggle...
...the
sun
does
not
set
over
the
ocean.
It
sets
on
Olympus
itself.
A
new
era
has
begun.
The
era
of
man!

That
frown
doesn't
suit
you,
Andromeda.
Have
something
to
drink.
Andromeda.
What's
your
name?
Perseus.
Take
this.
Please
drink.
DRACO:
Hands
off.
Our
daughter,
the
missionary.
Have
you
seen
what's
happening
Have
you
even
bothered
to
look?
We
serve
as
an
inspiration.
ANDROMEDA:
Hundreds
of
our
men
...yet
we
celebrate.
You
provoke
the
gods
and
you
act
Well,
what
do
you
want?
Should
we
be
trembling
The
gods
need
us.
They
need
our
worship.
What
do
we
need
of
them?
-
Look
at
my
daughter.
What
could
be
more
divine
than
her
face?
More
beautiful
More
beautiful
than
Aphrodite
herself.
-
We
are
the
gods
now.



Interesting.
You!
You
are
specks
of
dust
Your
very
breath
is
a
gift
from
Olympus.
You
have
insulted
powers
Who
are
you?
I
am
Hades.
Kneel.
Not
now,
Perseus.
You
will
have
your
chance.
HADES:
What
is
more
beautiful
than
death?
Gaze
upon
me,
mortal
queen.
ANDROMEDA:
Mother.

HADES:
...when
the
sun
is
eclipsed...
...I
will
unleash
the
Kraken.
Argos
will
be
swept
from
the
earth...
...and
all
of
you
with
it.
Unless...
...you
sacrifice
the
princess...
...you
so
foolishly
compare
to
the
gods.
Only
her
blood
will
sate
the
Kraken...
...and
Zeus...
...who
you
have
so
offended.
Choose
your
penance,
Argos.
Destruction
or
sacrifice.
This
is
the
will
of
Zeus.
The
will
of
your
father.
HERMES:
That
is
impossible.
He's
yours.
His
name
is
Perseus.
We
could
offer
him
sanctuary.
Have
I
heard
his
prayers?
This
son
knows
no
love
for
me.
He's
no
different
from
any
of
the
others
DRACO:
-
I'm
not
a
demigod.
I
don't
know.

AMMON:
-
He's
not
to
be
trusted.
Leave
him.
Is
it
possible?
If
it's
true
you
are
the
son
of
Zeus...
...you
can
save
us.
You
must
save
us.
I
can't
save
you.
I'm
just
a
man.
My
lord,
as
terrible
as
it
is
...a
sacrifice
is
the
only
way.
Don't
even
say
the
word.
ANDROMEDA:
No
one
should
have
to
die
for
me.
Let
Perseus
go.
Sire,
we
need
to
get
the
princess
-
I'll
find
a
place
to
hide
her.
So
says
the
bastard
son
of
a
god.
My
father...
...was
killed
by
a
god.
My
mother,
sister...
...everyone
I
loved
was
killed
by
a
god.
I
mend
nets...
...not
wield
a
sword.
So,
demigod,
you
have
a
visitor.
She
says
she
knows
you.
My
name
is
lo,
Perseus.
And
how
do
you
know
me?
I've
watched
you
all
your
life.
I
guided
you
to
your
family.
Are
you
a
god?
There
are
gods
and
there
are
men...
...and
there
are
those
of
us
Many
years
ago...
...I
refused
a
god's
advance.
I
was
cursed
with
agelessness.
That's
not
much
of
a
curse.
I've
lived
for
years
I
imagine
you're
sympathetic
Is
it
true?
Am
I
the
son
of
Zeus?
Yes.
The
story
of
your
birth
Mankind
had
grown
tired
Acrisius
led
a
siege
on
Olympus.
It
is
said
the
other
gods...
...wanted
to
simply
lay
waste
to
Acrisius
...but
Zeus
loved
man
too
much.
Instead,
he
chose
to
make
an
example
He
disguised
himself
as
the
king...
...and
visited
the
chamber
My
king.
Zeus?

IO:
He
ordered
the
execution
of
his
wife...
...and
Zeus'
newborn
son.
I
curse
you,
Zeus.
I
deny
you
the
body
you
soiled...
...and
the
bastard
child
with
it!

No!

The
queen
and
her
child
Your
mother
was
killed,
but
you...
...part
man,
part
god,
you
lived.
I've
watched
over
you
ever
since...
...waiting
for
the
day
when
you
will
help
You
were
born
to
kill
the
Kraken.
I
don't
know
why
I
was
born...
...or
what
I
am.
But
I
know
it's
not
the
Kraken
How
do
I
get
to
Hades?
If
the
Kraken
falls...
...Hades
will
be
weak
enough
Only
then
will
you
have
the
revenge
Then
they
better
release
me.

IO:
...the
Stygian
witches
will
know
how.
The
witches
are
further
away
No
man
can
go
there.
No
man.
Keep
your
distance,
lo.
Zeus,
forgive
us
for
these
affronts
And
you
still
believe
This
is
suicide.
MAN
1:
MAN
2:
We've
no
chance,
and
you
know
it.
Here's
who
you
drew
into
this,
Perseus.
Young
men
who
look
good
...and
old
soldiers,
Do
you
know
what
the
Kraken
is?
The
Kraken
is
the
end
of
us.
It
doesn't
think.
It
doesn't
feel.
-
And
you,
you're
going
to
kill
it?
-
I
don't
need
your
help.
You're
the
son
of
Zeus.
-
But
we
have
orders.
Gentlemen,
may
our
journey
be
long,
...and
may
we
all
complain
about
it
-
So
what
should
we
bring?
What
makes
you
think
the
witches
Oh,
they'll
tell
us,
or
I'll
kill
them
too.

MAN
4:
-
What
is
this?
MAN:
Don't
leave
us
WOMAN
1:
Stay
here.
Please?
Please?
Help
us.
WOMAN
2:
You're
just
going
to
Just
sacrifice
the
princess!
Watch
your
mouth!
Stay
back.
Stay
back!
You'd
think
they
might
be
thankful.
WOMAN
3:
Maybe
they're
tired
of
being
thankful.
OZAL:
My
brother
and
I
have
decided...
...to
accompany
you
on
your
journey.
We
can
be
of
great
help
to
you,
I
need
soldiers,
not
hunters.
Which
one
of
your
soldiers
...of
the
Nemean
lion?
Which
one
of
them
knows
the
soft
points
Which
one
of
them
knows
which
jugular
-
The
middle
one.
My
brother
and
I,
we
know
how
to
kill.
-
We
enjoy
it.
...and
you
don't
mind
dying,
come
along.
It
is
death
who
should
be
afraid
of
us.
HADES:
CALIBOS:
Just
Calibos.
HADES:
-
Zeus.
HADES:
CALIBOS:
Zeus'
seed
in
your
wife
survived.
The
child
of
your
shame.
Perseus.
CALIBOS:
You
murdered
your
wife
for
nothing.
Now
Perseus
hurls
himself
He
must
die.
-
What
would
you
have
me
do?
...but
I
am
growing
stronger.
Until
I
possess
my
full
power...
...you
will
be
my
weapon.
Come.
Use
this.
Kill
Perseus
for
me.
And
I'll
destroy
Zeus
for
you.
I
serve
you.
The
boy
will
die.

KUCUK:
You
should've
seen
my
father.
You.
Bring
your
weapon.
Have
you
handled
a
sword
before?
-
There's
been
no
need.
Left
foot
forward.
Your
motions
should
be
fluid.
The
weapon
is
a
part
of
you.
Like
the
sting
on
a
wasp.
Stay
focused.
Know
what's
around
you.
Keep
your
balance
at
all
times.
You
fall...

...you
die.
Get
up.
Don't...
There
is
a
god
in
you.
Be
sure
to
bring
it.
End
of
lesson.
Perseus.
A
gift
from
the
gods.
-
Forged
on
Olympus.
Just
accept
it.
I
can
do
this
as
a
man.
So
it's
yours.
Gentlemen,
retrieve
our
savior.


Shh.
The
Pegasus.
No
man
has
ever
ridden
one.
It's
a
message.
They're
watching
us.
PHAEDRUS:

PHAEDRUS:

Why
does
it
always
have
to
be...?
Listen.

PHAEDRUS:
Help
me!
You
reek
of
your
father.

Who
was
that?
Let
it
go.
No.
We
split
up.
Just
follow
the
blood.

Come
on!
KUCUK:
Are
you
happy
now?
Attack!
Wait!

DRACO:

PERSEUS:
DRACO:
I
fought
them
in
the
legion.
This
is
their
desert.
-
Enemies?
SOLON:
They
aren't
human.
Not
anymore.
-
Well,
somebody
should
thank
them.

-
What
is
it?
-
Pray.
Pray
to
Zeus
for
strength.
Pray
to
your
damn
father.
EUSEBIOS:
Hear
my
prayer.
-
No.

ANDROMEDA:
GIRL
1:
Thank
you.
-
Please.
Over

Over
here.

For
you.
No.
PROKOPION:
It
is
the
only
way!
Brothers
and
sisters!
Come
to
me!
Come!
I
have
the
way
out
of
our
misery.
Hades
has
asked
for
the
princess.
Sacrifice
one
for
the
life
of
the
city.
Why
do
they
remain
silent
Why
do
they
guard
the
woman
Is
she
better
than
any
one
of
you?
We
have
long
worshiped
Zeus
in
Argos.
But
it
is
Hades
We
must
pray
to
the
one
...and
who
offers
us
redemption...
...through
blood.


DRACO:
SOLON:
...they
replace
their
limbs
They
feel
no
pain.
Live
hundreds
of
years.
So
how
old
is
that
one?
I
don't
care.
I
don't
trust
them.
You're
burning.
Drink
this.
I'll
get
more
water.

Come
on!
IXAS:

DRACO:
What's
he
saying?
The
Djinn
have
waited
many
years
for
-
He
says
he
is
no
friend
of
the
humans.
But
the
only
way
we
can
help
Perseus
Draco.
Look.

Together.
-
He's
not
ready
to
travel.
-
He
may
be
a
demigod,
but
he's
still
mortal.
-
Yeah,
a
bit.
Your
pride
is
killing
my
men.
-
You
were
given
gifts.
Use
them.
-
I
don't
care
what
they
are.
Use
them.
I
will
not
use
that
sword
So
we'll
just
continue
to
die.
I
can't
become
like
them.
If
I
do
this,
I
do
it
as
a
man.
But
you
are
not
just
a
man.
I
choose
to
be.
A
man
cannot
do
this,
Perseus.
According
to
who?
The
gods?
If
I
had
your
gifts...
When
you
need
your
sword,
They're
riding
them.
They
tried
to
kill
us.
I'm
not
getting
on
it.
Magnificent.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Well,
we
need
to
make
up
for
lost
time.
We're
making
good
time.
Not
good
enough.
IXAS:
DRACO:
It'll
be
two
days
This
thing
is
making
me
feel
sick.
Trust
me,
it's
better
to
be
on
one

What,
don't
you
ever
smile?
When
I
spit
in
the
eyes
of
the
gods...
...then
I'll
smile.
-
What
is
this
place?
This
is
where
the
Kraken
It's
what
Argos
will
look
like
Every
step
we
take
-
Good.
Only
ask
what
you
need
to
know.
Of
course.

DEINO:
Give
it

Who

Who

DEINO:
Perseus,
no.
We
didn't
come
here
to

We
just
have
one
question.
DEINO:
Son
of
Zeus.
ENYO:
Perseus.
PEMPHREDO:

Flesh
of
a
god.
-
Witch.
Stale
meat,
ladies.

So
which
one's
ENYO:
You
want
to
know
about
the
Kraken.
PEMPHREDO:
Do
it.
-
That's
right.
The
Kraken
fears
no
weapon.
It
must
have
a
weakness.
Maybe.
But
knowledge
demands
payment.
-
Sacrifice.
SOLON:
Eusebios!
SOLON:
Look
out!
EUSEBIOS:
Help!
PERSEUS:
Let
him
go!
Do
it!
We
cannot
see
the
answers
Let
him
go!
Now
answer
the
question.
How
do
we
kill
the
Kraken?
-
There
is
a
solution.
But
it
is
an
impossible
one.
-
Yeah?
DEINO:
Anything
of
flesh
is
killed
by
her
gaze.
ENYO:
Killed
by
her.
...at
the
edge
of
the
underworld.
DRACO:
She's
no
use
against
the
Kraken.
Then
we
take
her
head.
ENYO:
Clever
boy.
-
The
eye.
Where
is
it?
But
wait.
There's
more.
Perseus,
no.
DEINO:
Tell
him.
What?
ENYO:
Fate
has
spoken.
You
will
die,
son
of
Zeus!
It's
a
lie.
Come.
Written
as
history.
Perseus.
You
will
die.
EUSEBIOS:
IXAS:
They
believe
we
will
all
die.
Who
are
you?
Well,
you
can
call
me
"Father"...
...if
you
wish.
He
was
killed
by
a
god.
An
unfortunate
casualty
Men
didn't
murder
my
family.
You
heard
the
witches'
prophesy.
You
will
not
defeat
the
Kraken,
If
you
continue
this
journey,
If
you're
so
sure,
why
are
you
here?
To
offer
you
sanctuary.
Your
blood
is
mine,
Perseus,
It's
time
you
came
to
Olympus
Rather
die
in
the
mud
with
those
men
You
foolish
boy.
Man's
entire
existence
For
someone
who
created
man...
...you
don't
know
much
about
us.
We
live...
...we
fight
and
we
die...
...for
each
other,
not
for
you.
Tell
Hades
I'll
see
him
soon.
-
I
will
not
make
this
offer
again.
Because
I'd
hate
to
refuse
you
twice.
Perseus.
Wait.
It's
expensive
where
you're
going.
Kucuk
fashioned
this
shield
Stronger
and
lighter
than
any
metal.
Very
rare
and
high-quality
item.
We
can
fight
anywhere...
...but
not
in
the
underworld.
Yeah.
Good
luck,
fisherman.
We
all
heard
what
the
witches
said.
But
we
can
prove
them
wrong.
I
need
your
help.
It
wasn't
the
gods
If
you
believe
that
we
have
a
chance.
I
never
liked
Argos
much
anyway.
IO:
Then
we
go
to
the
underworld.

SOLON:
Now
what?
Charon
only
ferries
the
dead.
Any
volunteers?
Heads
we
swim.
A
bribe
for
the
ferryman.

So,
what
happens
when
we
get
there?
Just
another
beast
to
kill.
A
beast?
Medusa
was
beautiful
once.
So
beautiful
as
to
tempt
Poseidon.
When
he
came
for
her...
...she
ran
to
Athena's
temple
thinking
She
didn't.
Poseidon
took
her
on
the
cold
floor.
She
prayed
to
Athena
for
comfort...
...but
the
goddess
felt
nothing
She
made
sure
One
look
at
the
creature
she
has
become
I
cannot
assist
you
there.
It
was
Athena's
one
bit
of
solace
to
Medusa
Only
men
are
allowed
in
the
temple.
Though
no
man
has
ever
made
it
out.

Medusa's
got
a
tail
Listen.
Hear
her
muscles
coil.
Smell
her
skin.
Feel
her
hunger
in
your
gut.
Medusa's
killed
you
twice
now.
Do
you
think
she'll
hand
you
her
head?
One
look
in
her
eyes
Good.
-
Try
not
to
enjoy
this
so
much.
Don't
look
at
me.
Ease
your
storm.

SOLON:
I
never
thought
I
could
reach
this
place.
Who'd
you
lose?
My
daughter.
Taken
away
on
her
16th
birthday.
Dragged
down
here.
I
have
a
feeling
I'll
see
her
soon.
You
brought
us
this
far.
-
How
many
coins
did
you
get,
Perseus?
I
only
knew
one
great
man
in
my
life.
My
father.
Now
I
know
four
more.
And
a
woman.
And
whatever
the
hell
you
are.
I
know
we're
all
afraid.
But
my
father
told
me:
Someday
someone
was
gonna
have
to
Someday
someone
This
could
be
that
day.
Trust
your
senses.
And
don't
look
this
bitch
in
the
eye.
-
Doesn't
really
inspire
confidence.
-
Listen.
Keep
your
eyes
down.

Here
we
go.

Solon!
Keep
going!
Flank
her.
-
Draco.
Eusebios,
follow
me.
Hang
on!




IXAS:
Remember
what
Perseus
said.
Eyes
down.
Lxas,
no.

Eyes
down.
Where
are
you?
Where
are
you?
PERSEUS:

Go!
Wait
here.
I'll
lure
her
out.
Get
ready.

Now!
Together.

Let
them
know
men
did
this.

Just
you
and
me,
son
of
Zeus.

Perseus.
Don't
become
one
of
them.
lo,
I'm
here.
There's
no
time.
The
eclipse.
Perseus,
you
must
go
before
it's
too
late.
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
My
fate
is
certain.
But
the
fate
of
Argos
All
my
life
you've
been
there.
You
never
left
me.
I
can't
leave
you.
This
part
of
the
journey
Perseus...
...you're
not
just
part
man,
part
god...
...you're
the
best
of
both.
Everything
will
be
all
right.
Brother.
It
is
time
for
the
mortals
to
pay.
My
child
waits
to
do
your
will.
ZEUS:
Release
the
Kraken!
The
Kraken
comes
now!
Our
suffering
ends
Will
it
take
us...
...or
will
it
take
Andromeda?
CROWD:
ANDROMEDA:
This
cannot
continue.
MAN
1:
Stay
back!
Look!
The
Kraken!
Help
us!

KEPHEUS:
Hades,
we
sacrifice
our
princess
It
comes,
brothers
and
sisters!

Argos
has
fallen.
Do
you
feel
stronger,
brother?
You
thought
the
Kraken
But
the
Kraken
is
my
child.
I
command
Olympus.
I
serve
myself.
I
have
since
you
cheated
me.
You
sent
me
to
the
underworld
...while
you
basked
in
their
love.
We
need
the
love
of
humans.
No,
you
need
it.
I
survive
on
their
fear.
Your
reign
is
over,
brother
Zeus.
You'll
watch
while
my
blessed
avenger
And
then
finally
you'll
know
my
pain.
There
is
still
a
demigod
in
Argos...
...brother.
Perseus.
The
bag!
Come
on!
Hyah!
KUCUK:

Come
on!

No!

I'm
a
god.
I
will
live
forever.
But
not
here.
ANDROMEDA:
For
you.
Not
for
me.
You
won't
stay,
will
you?
Perseus,
Argos
needs
a
ruler.
I
cannot
be
a
king.
I
serve
you
better
as
a
man.
You'll
make
a
fine
queen
for
them.
ZEUS:
As
do
I.
Hades
lives.
He's
just
sent
back
to
the
underworld.
Biding
his
time,
no
doubt.
Waiting
for
men
to
grow
weak,
It's
mankind
who
holds
the
key
It
always
was.
So
we'll
see
him
again.
Yes.
But
now
the
world
knows
Of
course,
you
had
some
help.
A
sword,
the
Pegasus...
I
wanted
men
to
worship
us
again,
That's
almost
human
of
you.
I
don't
suppose
you'll
reconsider
my
offer
I've
got
everything
I
need
right
here.
You
may
not
want
to
be
a
god,
Perseus...
...but
after
feats
like
yours,
Be
good
to
them.
Be
better
than
we
were.
And
if
you
insist
on
continuing
...I
won't
have
you
do
it
alone.
You're
the
son
of
Zeus,
after
all.
