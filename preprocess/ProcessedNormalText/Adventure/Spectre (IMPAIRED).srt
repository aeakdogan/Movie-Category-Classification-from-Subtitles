Take
your
time,
007,
but
in
five
minutes
the
head
of
the
Joint
Security
Service
is
going
to
walk
through
that
door,
and
I've
got
to
explain
to
him
how
one
of
our
agents
decided
to
and
cause
an
international
incident.
With
all
due
respect,
sir,
Worse?
You
blew
up
half
a
bloody
block.
Well,
better
half
a
block
than
You
had
no
authority.
None.
As
you
know,
we're
in
the
in
the
history
of
British
intelligence.
The
ink's
barely
dry
and
already
they're
itching
the
double-0
program
forever.
And
you've
just
given
them
one.
You're
right,
sir.
You
have
got
a
tricky
day
ahead.
This
is
an
official
question.
Mexico
City.
What
were
you
doing
there?
It
was
just
a
coincidence.
I
Okay.
Fine.
As

this
morning,

I'm
standing

down

good,
sir.
007?
Sir?
I
don't
know
what
you're
playing
at,
but
whatever
it
is,
it
has
to
stop.
Now.

So
sorry.
Am
I
interrupting?
007,
I'd
like
you
to
meet
Max
Denbigh,
head
of

Service.
It's
a
pleasure
to
finally
meet
Most
of

Congratulations
on
your
new
appointment.
Thank
you.
I
suppose
we
should
call
you
C
now.
No,
no.
"Max,"
please.
No,
I
think
I'll
call
you

As
you
wish.

That'll

Very
good,
sir.


James?
Moneypenny.
So?
How
was
the
meeting?
Very

What
do
you
mean?

Evening.
Come
in.
Have
you
just
moved
in?
No.
Well,
I
like
what
you've
Your
delivery.
Thank
you.
Would
you
like
a
drink?
No,
thanks.
I'm
not
staying.
That's
a
shame.
What's
going
on,
James?

There's
not
one
person
at
MI6
Talking
about
what,
exactly?
That
what
you
did
in
That
you're
finished.
And
what
do
you
think?
I
think
you're
just
getting
started.
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
All
right.
I
think
you've
got
a
secret.
And
it's
something
you
won't
tell
anyone.
Because
you
don't
trust
anyone.
If
anything
happens
to
me,
007,
Find
a
man
called
Marco
Sciarra.
Kill
him.
And
don't
miss
the
funeral.
Jesus.
Where
did
you
get
it?
In
my
mailbox
just
after
she
died.
Well,
she
was
never
short
of
surprises.
She
wasn't
gonna
let
death
I've
been
tracking
Sciarra
ever
since.
And
what
have
you
found?
Nothing
significant
yet.
When's
the
funeral?
Three
days.
In
Rome.
If
you
think
M's
signing
He
won't
let
you
out
of
his
sight.
Yes,
it's
a
bit
of
a
problem.
Listen.
Could
you
do
a
little
quiet
digging
for
me?
I
heard
a
name
in
Mexico.
"The
Pale
King."
You
want
me
to
be
your
mole.
Yes.
And
what
makes
you
think
you
can
trust
me?
Instinct.
TANNER:
Poor
old

Rigged
Cheaper
to
knock
her
down
than

Still.

all
that.

all
the
money's
been
spent
on

So
that's
C's
new

You've
met
him,
have
you?
Yesterday.
What
do
we
know
about
him?
Classic

a
dossier
last
year
on
how
the

was
obsolete,
how

could
do
all

to
school
with
the
Home
Secretary.
Of
course,
he
did.
This
merger's
just
the
start
of
it.
In
three
days,
there's
a

decide

New

If

his
way,
he'll

happened
while

and
an
It's
not
great
timing
for
us.
It's
all
rather
playing
into
C's
hands.
M,
well,
let's
say
he's
Yeah,
I've
noticed.
Now,
this
way,
007.
Be
careful.
It's
a
trifle
slippery.

through.
Shall
we
get

Just
relax.
That's
it.
Lovely.
Now,

may
feel

Q?
Well,
now
you
know
exactly
Will
you
do
something
for
me?
What
do
you
have
in
mind,
exactly?
Make
me
disappear.
May
I
remind
you
that
I
also
have

Well,
then
I
suggest

sake
of

Well,
it's
lovely
to
see
you,

Lovely.
Um,

you,

you

Please,
don't.

What's
that?
It's

Oh,
shit.


BOND:
I'm
sorry
for
your
loss.
You
knew
my
husband?
All
too
briefly.
What
do
you
do?
Life
insurance.
A
little
late
for
that.
For
your
husband,
yes.
But
what
about
you?
Me?
I
hear
the
life
expectancy
of
How
can
you
talk
like
this?
Can't
you
see
I'm
grieving?
No.



What
a
lovely
view.
You're
wasting
your
time.
There
are
100
more
that
will
come
after
me.
All
you
buy
me
is
five
minutes.
Excellent.
Time
for
a
drink.
You
killed
him,
didn't
you?
My
husband.
He
was
an
assassin.
Trust
me,
he
won't
take
it
personally.

You
signed
my
death
Loyal
to
a
man
you
hated.
He
trusted
my
silence.
With
him
gone,
I'm
a
dead
woman.
I
can
trust
nobody.
I
know
the
feeling
well.
Well,
I
can
tell
you
Well,
then
you
have
impeccable
instincts.
If
you
don't
leave
now,
we'll
die
together.
I
can
think
of
worse
ways
to
go.
Then
you're
obviously
crazy,
Mister...
Bond.
James
Bond.

These
people,
if
you
just
knew
what
they
could
do.
The
power
they
have.
Did
your
husband
ever
No.
The
organization,
they
hardly
ever
meet.
But
because
of
what
happened
to
my
husband,
they
meet
tonight.
Why?
To
choose
a
replacement.
Where?
The
Palazzo
Cardenza.
-
Midnight.
I
might
drop
by.
He
was
obsessed.
He
spent
more
time
with
them
than
with
me.
Then
the
man
was
a
fool.

Leaving
your
number?
BOND:

He'll

You'll

Do
me
a
favor.
Make
it
quick.
Upstairs,
Mr.
White.
I
always
knew
death
would
but
not
yours.
To
what
do
I
owe
this
pleasure,
Mr.
Bond?
I
was
at
a
meeting
recently
and
your
name
came
up.
I'm
flattered
London
is
It
wasn't
MI6.
It
was
Rome.
Your
team,
not
mine.
Ah.
Last
month,
I
found
It's
done
its
job.
I
have
So,
here
we
are,
Mr.
Bond,
two
dead
men
enjoying
the
evening.
What
did
you
do?
I
disobeyed
him.
I
followed
him
as
far
as
I
could.
He
changed.
Oh,
I
see.
You
grew
a
conscience.
Our
game
is
our
game.
But
this?
Women,
children...
Well,
the
thallium
would
suggest
that
he
doesn't
like
you
very
much
anymore.
And
clearly
the
feeling
is
mutual.
So
why
don't
you
tell
Oh,
come
on.
Tell
me
where
he
is.
He's
everywhere.
Everywhere!
He's
sitting
at
your
desk,
he's
kissing
your
lover,
he's

You're
protecting
someone.
Your
wife.

She
left
long
ago.
Your
son?
Your
daughter.
You
won't
find
her.
She's
clever.
She's
smarter
than
me.
I
can
protect
her
if

I
can
keep
her
alive.
Yeah.
You
have
my
word.
Your
word?
The
word
of
an
assassin!
That's
my
word.
L'Americain.
You
save
her,
she
can
lead
you
to
L'Americain.

long.

Have
you?
To
pull
that
trigger,
you
have
to
be
sure.
Yes,
you
investigate,

then
you
have
to
look
him
in

make

call.
And
all
the

can't
tell
you
what
to
do
next.
A
license
to

also
a
license
not
to

I
didn't
want
to
have
to
do
this,

Please
excuse
me,
Mr.

My

Madeleine
Swann.
Our
job
today
is
to
analyze
your

both
psychological
and
physical.
Hmm,

pretty
straightforward.
I

you
don't

How
much
alcohol
do
you
consume?
Too
much.
Some
broader
questions.
As
a

would
you
say

My
parents
died
when
I
was
young.
Really?
How
old?
Old
enough
to
remember.
How,
if
I
may
ask?
It
was
a
climbing
accident.
So
who
brought
you
up?
Someone
else.

years

me,

from
something.
You're
paying

Who's
asking
the
questions,
you
or
me?
Of
course.
Carry
on.
I
see
you
left
this
final
question
blank.
What
is
your
occupation?
Well,
that's
not
the

of

why
is
that?

Where
is
he?
Your
father's
dead.
Two
days
ago.

How
do
you
know?
Because
I
was
there.
Did
you
kill
him?
I
didn't
have
to.
He
did
it
himself.
And
you
came
all
the

my

dead?
I
came
to
tell
you
that

Why?
You're

Why
would

trust
you?
Because
he

that

what
was

Yes.
I

that.
But
I
saw
him.
He's
not

I'll
ever
forget.
So
you

I

Well,
that
narrows
it
down.
Look,
I'm
sorry,
007,
but
time's
up.
My

is
on

Right,

Argh,

Hey!
You

to

a
breath

Just

it

I

You

to

It's

Keep

That's
what

good
at.

I'll
kill
you.
I
don't
doubt
it.

Look.
There
are

Two

Lucky
me.



Who
sent
you?
Who
are
you
working
for?
Now,
where
did
you

Of

What
is

Nothing.
What's
this?
It's

Nowhere.

Well,

Always
looking
behind

Always
alone?
But
I'm
not
alone.
Answer
the
question.
I'm
not
sure
I
ever
had
a
choice.
Anyway,
I
don't
stop
to
think
about
it.
What
would
happen
if
you
did?

Stop?
I
don't

sir.
Could
you
leave
them
there,
please.

You
know,
I
think
you're
wrong.
I
am?
We
always
have
a
choice.
I'll
drink

that.









Shit.

What
do
we
do
now?
BOND:

might
be
a
long

Are
you
having
second

Too
late

Torture
is
easy,
A
man
can
watch
himself
being
disemboweled
and
derive
great
horror
but
it's
still
going
on
at
a
distance.
It
isn't
taking
place
where
he
is.
As
you
know
all
too
well,
dear
That's
where
the
seat
of
his
soul
is.
Now,
James
and
I
were
both
present
recently
when
a
man
was
deprived
of
his
eyes.
And
the
most
astonishing
thing
happened.
Didn't
you
notice?
He
wasn't
there
anymore.
He'd
gone
even
though
he
was
still
alive.
So
in
this
brief
moment
there
was
nobody
inside
his
skull.
Most
odd.
So,
James.

I'm
going
to
penetrate
to
where
you
are.
To
the
inside
of
your
head.
Now,
the
first
probe

hearing
and
your
balance,

with
the
subtlest
of
manipulations.
Well,
get
on
with
it

Nothing
can
be

All
right.
Let's
begin.




Why
are
you
doing
this?
You
probably
know
that
James
here
lost
his
parents
when
he
was
young.
But
did
you
know
that
it
was
my
father
who
helped
him
through
this
difficult
time?
Over
the
course
of
two
winters
he
taught
him
to
ski,
and
climb,
and
hunt.
He

to
treat
him

My

formed

an
attachment.
So,
you
killed
him.
Yes,
I
did.
You
know
what
happens
when
a
cuckoo
hatches
inside
another
bird's
nest?
Yes.
It
forces
the
other
eggs
out.
BLOFELD:
Yes.
Well,
this
cuckoo
made
me
realize
In
a
way,
he's
responsible
So,
thank
you.

Cuckoo.

Do
you

Do
those
blue
I'd
recognize
you
anywhere.
The
watch.
One
minute.
One
minute.
BLOFELD:
Did
he
say
something?
Tempus
fugit.
-
What?
I
can't
hear
you,
James.
BOND:
I
said,
doesn't
time
fly?


In
there!
Let's
go
home.

It's
not
over
yet.
Q:
I've
never
even
heard
of
Hildebrand.
M:
That
is
the
general
Exactly
how
safe
is
this,
sir?
We're
about
to
find
out.
It's
safe.
Better
wait
here.
I'm
M.
Madeleine
Swann.
Pleased
to
meet
you.
So,
what
do
you
have
for
me,
007?
The
recently
deceased
head
of
and
his
chief
of
intelligence,
About
to
take
control
of
his
very
that
he
built
right
here
under
our
noses.
Then
we'd
better
move.
The
BOND:
If
that
happens,
Spectre
So,
you
and
I
will
have
a
quiet
word
with
C
while
Q
hacks
into
the
system
It
won't
be
easy.
He'll
find
a
way.
He
always
does.
It's
good
to
have
you
back,
007.
Sir.
James,
I
can't.
I'll
come
back
for
you
when
it's
all
over.
No,
I
can't.
No,
you
can't
stay
here,
or
you...
I
can't
go
back
to
this
life.
And
This
is
who
you
are.
You're
saying
good-bye.
Yes.
Take
care.
You're
a
good
man,
James.
Are
you
in
yet,
Q?
A
few
layers
of
impenetrable
but
I
think
I'm
getting
somewhere.
They've
seen
us!
Reverse!

Go!
Get
him
in
the
building!
Move.
Move!

Go
back
and
find
M,
now!
We
need
them
both.
Not
a
good
feeling
being
watched,
is
it?
Don't
tell
me
you're
responsible
for
this.
No,
but
my
Quartermaster
is.
And
he's
extremely
talented.
C:
Well,
bravo.
But
in
case
you
hadn't
realized
So
you're
trespassing.
I'm
afraid
you've
got
the
We're
going
to
stop
And
then
I'm
going
to
bring
you
in.
On
what
grounds
exactly?
Poor
taste
in
friends.
Take
a
look
at
the
world.
Chaos.
Because
people
like
you,
paper-pushers
and
politicians,
are
too
spineless
to
do
So
I
made
an
alliance
to
put
And
now
you
want
to
throw
it
Whatever
the
hell
that
is.
How
predictably
moronic.
But
then
isn't
that
what
M
stands
for?
-
"Moron."
And
now
we
know
what
C
stands
for.
"Careless."


Come
on.
-

You're
a
hard
man
to
kill,
Blofeld.
Ouch.
I
do
hope
that
doesn't
hurt
too
much.
My
wounds
will
heal.
What
about
yours?
Look
around
you,
James.
Look.
This
is
what's
left
of
your
world.
Everything
you
ever
stood
for,
Why
are
we
here?
Did
you
miss
me?
No.
But
I
know
someone
who
does.
Where
is
she?
That's
for
you
to
find
out.
In
three
minutes,
this
I
can
get
out
easily.
Now,
you
have
a
choice.
Die
trying
to
save
her
or
save
yourself
and
live
with
the
pain.
You're
bluffing.
Am
I?


I've
really
put
That's
brothers
for
you.
They
always
know
which
buttons
to
press.

Madeleine!
-
Come
on.
Come
on.
Yes!
Let's
go.
After
you.
Why
can't
you
just
face
it,
M?
You
don't
matter
anymore.
Maybe
I
don't.
But
something
has
to.

Dead.
-
Any
word
on
Bond?
But
I
can
hazard
a
guess.
Madeleine!
Madeleine!



Do
you
trust
me?
Do
I
have
a
choice?
Not
anymore.

Come
on!
Good-bye,
James
Bond.





Brace,
brace,
brace!







Sir,
this
is
a
terrorist
alert.
Mallory,
double-0
section.
Stand
them
down.
Echo
team,
hold
fire.
Stand
down.

Finish
it.
Finish
it.


Out
of
bullets.
And
besides,
I've
got
something
better
to
do.
Under
the
Special
Measures
Act
of
2001,
I
am
detaining
you
on
behalf


Bond?

-
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
thought
you'd
gone.
I
have.
There's
just
one
thing
I
need.
