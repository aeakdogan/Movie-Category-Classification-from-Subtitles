Good
morning,
Soldier.
Ready

comply.
I
have
a
mission
for
you.
Sanction
and
extract.
No

Well
done
Soldier.

STEVE:

Standard

Small

It's
a

There's
an

Both

So,

Yeah,

STEVE:
Eyes

This

If
he
sees
us
coming,
He
kind

Tag
it.
Give

That

And

It's

this.

Thanks,

Don't

Your

What
did
you
say?
He
remembered
you.
I
was

He
got
all
weepy
about
it.
Till
they
put
his
brain
back
in
a
blender.
He
wanted
you
to
know
something.
He
said
to
me...
"Please
tell
Rogers.
"When
you
gotta
go...
"you
gotta
go."
And
you're
coming
with
me.



Oh,

We

Wow.
That

Oh,

So

So

Wow!

Out

It's

I'll

We'll
catch

later.
That

nice,
Ah,
they
deserve
it.
Plus,
it
helps
ease
my
conscience.

say
there's
a

But
if
you've

break

Right?

Okay.

I'm
very
proud
of
what
he
grew
up
to
be.
His

was
Charlie
Spencer.
You
murdered
him.
In
Sokovia.
Not
that
that
matters
in
the
least
to
you.
You
think
you
fight
for

You
just

He's

How

In

Are
you
saying
it's
our

I'm
saying
there
may
be
a
causality.
Our

invites
challenge.
Challenge
incites
conflict.
And
conflict...
breeds

No,
you

Unprecedented.

Okay.
Case
closed.
I
win.
I

And
now,
I

like
to
come
up

say
a
few
words.

Margaret
Carter
was
known
to
most
but
I
just
knew
her
as
Aunt
Peggy.
She
had
a
photograph
in
her
office.
Aunt
Peggy
standing
next
to
JFK.
As
a
kid,
that
was
pretty
cool.
But
it
was
a
lot
to
live
up
to.
Which
is
why
I
never
told
I
asked
her
once
how
she
managed
in
a
time
when
no
one
wanted
to
see
She
said,
compromise
where
you
can.
But
where
you
can't,
don't.
Even
if
everyone
is
telling
you
Even
if
the
whole
world
it
is
your
duty
to
plant
look
them
in
the

found
out

Vision.
Clint?

it?

can't

It's

up,
Cap.
German
Special
Forces,
Understood.
Do
you
know
me?
You're
Steve.
I
read
about
you
in
a
museum.
SAM:
They've
set
the
perimeter.
I
know
you're
nervous,
But
you're
lying.
I
wasn't
in
Vienna.
They're
entering
the
building.
Well,
the
people
And
they're
not
planning
That's
smart.
Good
strategy.

They're
on
the
roof.
I'm
compromised.
This
doesn't
have
to
end
in
a
fight,
Buck.
-
It
always
ends
in
a

You
pulled
me
from
the

Why?
-
I
don't

Yes,
you
do.

Buck,
stop!
You're
gonna

I'm

Stand

Congratulations,

You're

Your

"A

A
pinch.

Is
that
paprikash?
I
thought
it
might
lift

Spirits
lifted.
In

I
haven't

Please.

Wanda?
No

you,
Wanda.
Thanks.
Oh,
you're
welcome.
No,
it's
a
involuntary
response
They
can't
help
but
be
afraid
of
you.
Are
you?
My
amygdala
is
synthetic,
so...

I
used
to
think
of
myself
one
way.
But
after
this...
I
am
something
else.
I'm
still
me,
I
think,
but...
that's
not
what
everyone
else
sees.
Do
you
know,
I
don't
know
what
this
is?
Not
really.
I
know
it's
not
of
this
world...
that
it
powered
Loki's
staff,
its
true
nature
is
a
mystery.
And
yet,
it
is
part
of
me.
Are
you
afraid
of
it?
I
wish
to
understand
it.
The
more
I
do,
the
less
it
controls
me.
One
day...
who
knows?
I
may
even
control
it.
I
don't
know
what's
in
this
I'm
gonna
go
to
the
store.
I'll
be
back
in
20
minutes.
Alternatively,
we
could
order
a
pizza?
Vision,
are
you
not
letting
me
leave?
It
is
a
question

safety.
I
can
protect
myself.
Not
yours.

about

Lawyer.
That's
funny.
See

are
placed
in
lockup.
We'll
write
you
a

I
better
not
look
out

EVERETT:
You'll
be

Now,
do
me
a
favour,
stay

I
don't

you,

"Consequences"?

If
not
for
these,
I'm
trying
to...
What
do
you
call
it?
That's
an
olive
branch.
Is
that
what
you
call
it?
Is
Pepper
here?
I
didn't
see
her.
We're
kinda...
-
Well,
not
kinda...
No.
Definitely
not.
We're
taking
a
break.
It's
nobody's
fault.
I'm
so
sorry,
Tony.
I
didn't
know.
A
few
years
ago,
I
almost
lost
her,
Then,
we
had
to
mop
up
HYDRA...
and
then
Ultron.
My
fault.
And
then,
and
then,
and
then,
Because
the
truth
is
I
don't
wanna
stop.
I
don't
wanna
lose
her.
I
thought
maybe
the
Accords
In
her
defence,
I'm
a
handful.
Yet,

was

glad

Oh,

Maybe
only
a
thousand

I
hated

I
don't

I

I
see

pointed

I
can't
ignore
it.
Sometimes
I
wish
I
could.
No,
you
don't.
No,
I
don't.
Sometimes...
Sometimes
I
wanna
But
I
don't
wanna
see
you
gone.
We
need
you,

So
far,
nothing's

it's

there

be
safeguards.
Sure.
Once
we
put

She's
fine.
She's

It's

worse
ways
to
protect

Protection?
Is
that
how
you
see
this?
This
is
protection?
It's
internment,
Tony.
-
She's
not
a
US
citizen.
And
they
don't
grant
visas
She's
a
kid!
Give
me
a
break!
I'm
doing
what
has
to
be
done.
To
stave
off
something
worse.
You
keep
telling
yourself
that.
Hate
to
break

Hello,

Yeah.
HELMUT

Tell
me,

You've
seen
a
great
deal,
haven't
you?
I
don't
wanna
talk
about
it.
You
fear
that
if
you
open
your
mouth,
Don't
worry.
We
only
have
to
talk
about
one.


Come

Your

You
used

wear

Can't
read
that
in
a
museum.
Just
like
that,
we're
supposed
to
be
cool?
What
did
I
do?
Enough.
Oh,
God,
I
knew
this
would
happen.
Everything
HYDRA
All
he
had
to
do
-
Who
was
he?
People
are
dead.
The
bombing,
the
setup...
the
doctor
did
all
that
just
I
need
you
to
do
He
wanted
to
know
about
Siberia.
Where
I
was
kept.
He
wanted
to
know
exactly
where.
Why
would
he
need
to
know
that?
Because
I'm
not
the
only
Winter
Soldier.


It
hurts!



Good
work.



Get
me
out
of
here.
Who
were
they?
BUCKY:
Their
most
elite
death
squad.
More
kills
than
anyone
in
HYDRA
history.
And
that
was
before
the
serum.
They
all
turn
out
like
you?
Worse.
The
doctor,
could
he
control
them?
Enough.
Said
he
wanted
to
see
an
empire
fall.
BUCKY:
With
these
guys,
he
could
do
it.
They
speak
30
languages,
infiltrate,
assassinate,
destabilise.
They
can
take
a
whole
country
down

would
have
been

Even

he
did...
Who
knows

not.

It's

do
you

Thank
you,

Is

You
all
right?
Always.
36

Jeez.
We're

understaffed.
Oh,
yeah.
It'd
be
great
if
we
had
You
really
think
he'd
be
on
our
side?
No.
I
have
an
idea.
Me,
too.
Where's
yours?
Downstairs.
Where's
yours?


Hey,
May.

MAY:
Mmm.
Hey.
How
was
school
today?
PETER:
It
was
okay.
This
crazy

parked

-
Oh,
Mr
Parker.

What
are
you
doing...
Hey!
Uh,
I'm
Peter.
Tony.
What
are
you
doing
here?
It's
about
time
we
met.
You've
been
getting
my
emails,
right?
-
Yeah.
Yeah.
Regarding
the...
You
didn't
even
tell
me
about
the
grant.
-
About
the
grant.
-
Right.
Remember
when
you
applied?
Yeah.
I
approved,
so
now
we're
in
business.
But
you
didn't
tell
me
anything.
You
keeping
secrets
from
me
now?
I
just
know
how
much
you
love
surprises
Anyway,
what
did
I
apply
for?
That's
what
I'm
here
to
hash
out.
Okay.
Hash
it
out,
okay.
It's
so
hard
for
me
to
believe
Yeah,
well,
we
come
in
This
walnut
date
loaf
is
exceptional.
-
Let
me
just
stop
you
there.
Is
this
grant
got
money
TONY:
Yeah,
it's
pretty
well
funded.
Yeah?
Wow.
Look
who
you're
talking
to.
-
Can
I
have
five
minutes
with
him?
As
walnut
date
loaves
go,
that
wasn't
bad.
Whoa,
what
have
we
here?
Retro
tech,
huh?
Thrift
store?
Salvation
Army?
-
Uh,
the
garbage,
actually.
Yeah,
I
was...
Anyway,
look,
um,
I
definitely
-
Ah-ah!
Me
first.
Quick
question
of
the
rhetorical
variety.
That's
you,
right?
Um,
no.
-

What
do
you
mean?
Look
at
you
go.
Wow!
Nice
catch.
That's
not
easy.
You
got
mad
skills.
That's
all
on
YouTube,
though,
right?
That's
where
you
found
that?
Because
you
know
that's
all
fake.
It's
all
done
on
the
computer.
Mmm-hmm.
It's
like
that
video.
What
is
it?
Yeah.
Oh,
you
mean
like
Exactly.
Oh,
what
have
we
here?

Uh...

You're
the
Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting

You're
Spider-Boy?
Spider-Man.
Not
in
that
onesie,
you're
not.
It's
not
a
onesie.
I
don't
believe
this.
I
was
actually
Didn't
miss
my
train,
this
perfectly
good
and
Algebra
test,
nailed
it.
Who
else
knows?
Anybody?
Nobody.
Not
even
your
unusually
attractive
aunt?
No.
No.
No!
If
she
knew,
she
would
freak
out.
And
when
she
freaks
out,
I
freak
out.
You
know
what
I
think
is
really
cool?
That
tensile
strength
is
off
the
charts.
Who
manufactured
that?
I
did.
Climbing
walls,
how
you
doing
that?
Adhesive
gloves?
It's
a
long
story.
I
was...
Lordy!
Can
you
even
see
in
these?
Yes,
I
can.
I'm
blind!
I
can
see
in
those.
Okay?
It's
just
that
when
whatever
it's
like
my
senses
There's
way
too
much
input,
You're
in
dire
need
of
an
upgrade.
Systemic,
top
to
bottom,
That's
why
I'm
here.
Why
you
doing
this?
I
gotta
know,
what's
your
MO?
What
gets
you
outta
that
Because...

Because
I've
been
me
my
whole
life,
Mmm-hmm.
I
read
books,
I
build
computers.
Yeah,
I
would
love
to
play
football,
Sure,
because
you're
different.
Exactly.
But
I
can't
tell
When
you
can
do
the
things
and
then
the
bad
things
happen...
they
happen
because
of
you.
So
you
wanna
look
out
for
the
little
guy,
Make
the
world
Yeah,
just
looking
out
for
the
little
guy.
That's
what
it
is.
I'm
gonna
sit
here,
so
you
move
the
leg.

You
got
a
passport?
No,
I
don't
even
have
a
driver's
licence.
-
You
ever
been
to
Germany?
Oh,
you'll
love
it.
-
I
can't
go
to
Germany.
I
got
homework.
I'm
gonna
pretend
you
didn't
say
that.
No,
I'm
being
serious.
Might
be
a
little
dangerous.
Better
tell
Aunt
Hottie
Don't
tell
Aunt
May.
All
right,
Spider-Man.
Get
me
out
of
this.
Sorry.
I'll
get
the...

What
is
it?
Stay
here,
please.

Guess
I
shoulda
knocked.
Oh,
my
God!
What
are
you
doing
here?
Disappointing
my
kids.
I'm
supposed
to
go
waterskiing.
Cap
needs
our
help.
Come
on.
Clint!
You
should
not
be
here.
Really?
I
retire
for,
what,
like
five
minutes,
Please
consider
Okay,
they're
considered.

Okay,
we
gotta
go.
It's
this
way.
I've
caused
enough
problems.

You
gotta
help
me,
Wanda.
Look,
you
wanna
mope,
You
wanna
make
amends,
Shit.

I
knew
I
should've
stretched.

VISION:
Clint,
you
can't
overpower
me.
I
know
I
can't.
But
she
can.
Vision,
that's
enough.
Let
him
go.
I'm
leaving.
I
can't
let
you.
I'm
sorry.
If
you
do
this...
they
will
never
stop
being
afraid
of
you.
I
can't
control
their
fear,
only
my
own.
CLINT:
Oh...
Come
on.
We
got
one
more
stop.
ATTACHE:
It's
just
a
matter
of
time.
Our
satellites
are
running
and
behavioural
pattern
scans.
Move
or
you
will
be
moved.
As
entertaining
as
that
would
be...
You
really
think
you
can
find
him?
My
resources
are
considerable.
Yeah,
it
took
the
world
so
you
could
probably
do
that
You
know
where
they
are.
I
know
someone
who
does.
Not
sure
you
understand
It's
low
profile.
Good,
because
this
stuff
Can
you
move
your
seat
up?
No.
I
owe
you
again.
Keeping
a
list.
You
know,
he
kinda
tried
to
kill
me.
Sorry.
I'll
put
it
on
the
list,
too.
They're
going
to
come
looking
for
you.
I
know.
Thank
you,
Sharon.
That
was...
Late.
Damn
right.
I
should
go.
Okay.
Cap.
You
know
I
wouldn't
have
called
Hey,
man,
you're
doing
me
a
favour.
Besides,
I
owe
a
debt.
Thanks
for
having
my
back.
It
was
time
to
get
off
my
ass.
How
about
our
other
recruit?
He's
rarin'
to
go.
Had
to
put
a
little
coffee
in
him...

but
he
should
be
good.
What
time
zone
is
this?
Come
on.
Come
on.
-
Captain
America!
It's
an
honour.
I'm
shaking
your
hand
too
long.
Wow!
This
is
awesome!
Captain
America.
Jeez.
Ah,
look,
I
wanna
say,
I
know
thinks
for
thanking
of
me.
-
Hey,
man!
Uh,
good
to
see
you.
Look,
what
happened
last
time
when
I...
It
was
a
great
audition,
They
tell
you
what
we're
up
against?
Something
about
some
psycho-assassins?
We're
outside
the
law
on
this
one.
So
if
you
come
with
us,
Yeah,
well,
what
else
is
new?
We
should
get
moving.
We
got
a
chopper
lined
up.

They're
evacuating
the
airport.
Stark.
Stark?
Suit
up.
IRON
MAN:
Wow,
it's
so
weird
-
Don't
you
think
that's
weird?
CAPTAIN
AMERICA:
Hear
me
out,
Tony.
That
doctor,
the
psychiatrist,
Captain.
Your
Highness.
IRON
MAN:
Anyway...
Ross
gave
me
36
hours
to
bring
you
in.
That
was
24
hours
ago.
You're
after
the
wrong
guy.
Your
judgement
is
askew.
Your
old
war
buddy
killed
And
there
are
five
more
I
can't
let
the
doctor
BLACK
WIDOW:
Steve...
you
know
what's
about
to
happen.
Do
you
really
wanna
All
right,
I've
run
out
of
patience.
Underoos!
-
Nice
job,
kid.
I
could
have
stuck
the
landing
New
suit.
It's
nothing,
Mr
Stark.
It's
perfect.
Thank
you.
Yeah,
we
don't
really
need
Okay.
Cap.
Captain.
Big
fan.
I'm
Spider-Man.
Yeah,
we'll
talk
about
it
later.
-

Hey,
everyone.
You've
been
busy.
And
you've
been
a
complete
idiot.
Dragging
in
Clint...
"Rescuing"
Wanda
from
a
place
she
doesn't
I'm
trying
to
keep...

I'm
trying
to
keep
you
from
You
did
that
when
you
signed.
All
right,
we're
done.
You're
gonna
turn
Barnes
over,
you're
gonna
or
a
squad
of
J-SOC
guys...
with
no
compunction
about
being
impolite.
Come
on.
FALCON:
We
found
it.
Their
Quinjet's
in
All
right,
Lang.
Hey,
guys,
something...

Whoa.

What
the
hell
was
that?
I
believe
this
is
yours,
Captain
America.
Oh,
great.
All
right,
there's
two
One
of
them's
Maximoff,
Rhodey,
you
wanna
take
Cap?
Got
two
in
the
terminal,
Barnes
is
mine.
-

Hey,
Mr
Stark,
what
should
I
do?
What
we
discussed.
Keep
your
distance,
web
them
up.
Okay,
copy
that.
Move,
Captain.
I
won't
ask
a
second
time.
Look,
I
really
don't
want
to
hurt
you.
I
wouldn't
stress
about
it.



What
the
hell
is
that?
Everyone's
got
a
gimmick
now.

You
have
a
metal
arm?
That
is
awesome,
dude.
You
have
the
right
to
remain
silent!
Sorry,
Cap,
this
won't
kill
you...
but
it
ain't
gonna
tickle
either.
Wanda,
I
think
you
hurt
Vision's
feelings.
You
locked
me
in
my
room.
Okay,
first,
that's
an
exaggeration.
Second,
I
did
it
to
protect
you.
-
Hey,
Clint.
Clearly,
retirement
doesn't
suit
you.
You
got
tired
of
shooting
golf?
Well,
I
played
18,
shot
18.
Just
can't
seem
to
miss.
First
time
for
everything.
Made
you
look.
FRIDAY:
Multiple
contusions
detected.
Yeah,
I
detected
that,
too.
Oh,
God!
Hey,
buddy,
I
think
you
lost
this!

Ahh!
Those
wings
carbon
fibre?
Is
this
stuff
coming
out
of
you?
That
would
explain
which,
gotta
say,
that's
awesome,
man.
I
don't
know
if
you've
but
there's
usually
not
this
much
talking.
All
right,
sorry.
My
bad.
Guys,
look,
I'd
love
to
keep
this
up,
and
I
gotta
impress
Mr
Stark,


You
couldn't
have
done
that
earlier?
I
hate
you.
Great.
Hey,
Cap,
heads-up!
Throw
it
at
this.
Now!
Oh,
come
on!
Oh,
man,
I
thought
it
was
a
water
truck.
Uh,
sorry.
All
right,
now
I'm
pissed.
Is
this
part
of
the
plan?
Well,
my
plan
was
go
easy
on
them.
You
wanna
switch
it
up?
There's
our
ride.
Come
on!
Captain
Rogers...
I
know
you
believe
But
for
the
collective
good...
you
must
surrender
now.

FALCON:
What
do
we
do,
Cap?
We
fight.
This
is
gonna
end
well.
They're
not
stopping.
Neither
are
we.

We're
still
friends,
right?
Depends
on
how
hard
you
hit
me.

You
were
pulling
your
punches.
I
didn't
kill
your
father.
Then
why
did
you
run?
That
thing
does
not
obey
Look,
kid,
there's
a
lot
going
on
here
Mr
Stark
said
you'd
say
that.
Wow.
He
also
said
to
go
for
your
legs.

Ahh!
Clint,
can
you
get
him
off
me?
Buckled
in?
ANT-MAN:
Yeah.
No,
I'm
good.
I'm
good,
Arrow
Guy.
Let's
go!

Stark
tell
you
anything
else?
That
you're
wrong.
You
think
you're
right.
That
makes
you
dangerous.
Guess
he
had
a
point.
You
got
heart,
kid.
Where
you
from?
Queens.
Brooklyn.


Friday?
FRIDAY:
What?
Oh,
you're
gonna
have
to
Who's
speaking?
It's
your
conscience.
Friday?
FRIDAY:
Deploying
fire
suppression
system.
Uh-oh.
Oh,
boy!
Whoa!

We
gotta
go.
We
gotta
draw
out
the
flyers.
I'll
take
Vision,
you
get
to
the
jet.
No,
you
get
to
the
jet!
Both
of
you!
The
rest
of
us
aren't
getting
out
of
here.
As
much
as
I
hate
to
admit
it...
if
we're
gonna
win
this
one,
FALCON:
This
isn't
the
real
fight,
Steve.
All
right,
Sam.
What's
the
play?
We
need
a
diversion.
Something
big.
ANT-MAN:
I
got
something
kinda
big.
But
I
can't
hold
it
very
long.
On
my
signal,
run
like
hell.
And
if
I
tear
myself
in
half...
He's
gonna
tear
himself
in
half?
You
sure
about
this,
Scott?
ANT-MAN:
I
do
it
all
the
time.
I
mean,
once.
In
a
lab.
Then
I
passed
out.
I'm
the
boss,
I'm
the
boss,
I'm
the
boss.

Holy
shit!

Okay,
tiny
dude
is
big
now.
He's
big
now.
I
guess
that's
the
signal.
Way
to
go,
Tic
Tac!
Give
me
back
my
Rhodey.
I
got
him.

Okay,
anybody
on
our
side
and
fantastic
abilities
I'm
open
to
suggestions.

ANT-MAN:
You
wanna
get
to
them...
you
gotta
go
through
me.

Uh-huh.

We
haven't
met
yet.
-
I'm
Clint.

Whoa!
Ahhh!
Get
off!
Something
just
flew
in
me!

You're
not
gonna
stop.
You
know
I
can't.
I'm
gonna
regret
this.

Go.
Hey,
guys,
you
ever
see
Empire
Strikes
Back?
WAR
MACHINE:
I
don't
know,
I
didn't
carbon-date
him.
He's
on
the
young
side.
You
know
that
part
with
the
walking
thingies?
Maybe
the
kid's
onto
something.
High
now,
Tony.
Go
high.
SPIDER-MAN:
Yes!

That
was
awesome!

Does
anyone
have
any
orange
slices?
-
Kid,
you
all
right?
Whoa!
Same
side.
Guess
who.
Hi.
It's
me.
-

Hey,
man.
-
That
was
scary.
You're
done,
all
right?
What?
I'm
good,
I'm
fine.
You
did
a
good
job.
Stay
down.
No,
it's
good.
I
gotta
get
him
back.
You're
going
home
or
I'll
call
Aunt
May!
-
Dude.
Wait.
Mr
Stark,
wait.


Okay,
I'm
done.
I'm
done.
BLACK
WIDOW:
I
said
There's
a
difference.

I'm
sorry.
Me,
too.
It's
as
I
said.
Catastrophe.
Vision,
I
got
a
bandit
on
my
six.
Vision!
You
copy?
Target

Rhodey!

Hello?
Your

is
here.
May
I
let
myself
in?

What's
gonna
happen
to
your
friends?

Whatever
it
is...
I'll
deal
with
it.
I
don't
know
if
I'm
worth
all
this,
Steve.
What
you
did
all
those
years...
It
wasn't
you.
You
didn't
have
a
choice.
I
know.
But
I
did
it.

How
did
this
happen?
I
became
distracted.

I
didn't
think
that
was
possible.
Neither
did
I.

The
doctors
say
Extreme

looking
for.
Right?
That
didn't
used
to
mean
me.
Or
Sam,
or
Wanda.
But
here
we
are.

Because
you
broke
the
law.
I
didn't
make
you.
-
La,
la,

la,

You're
all
grown
up,
I
don't
understand,
why
didn't
you
think
about
them
before
You
gotta
watch
your
back
with
this
guy.
There's
a
chance
he's
gonna
break
it.
Hank

always
said

Come
on,

SAM:
How's

They're
flying
him

fingers
crossed.

I'm

better
go
get
a
bad

gonna
have
to

out
of

I
just
knocked

got
about
30
seconds
before
SECRETARY
ROSS:
What'd
you
do?
Get
it
back
up!
Just
look.
Because
that...
is
the
fellow
who
was
Clearly,
I
made
a
mistake.
That's
a
first.

definitely
off
the

he's
about
to

don't
know
each
other

well.
You
don't
have
to...
Hey,
it's
all
right.

Look,
I'll
tell
you...
but
you
have
to
go
alone
and
as
a
friend.
Easy.
SECRETARY
ROSS:
Stark?
Did
he
give
you
anything
on
Rogers?
Nope.
Told
me
to
go
to
hell.
I'm
going
back
to
the
compound
instead,
I'll
put
you
on
hold.
You
remember
that
time

You

Yeah.
You
seem
a
little
defensive.
It's
been
a
long
day.
At
ease,
Soldier.
Then
why
are
you
here?
Could
be
your
story's
not
so
crazy.
Maybe.
Ross
has
no
idea
I'm
here.
Otherwise,
I
gotta
arrest
myself.
Well,
that
sounds
like
a
lot
of
paperwork.

It's
good
to
see
you,

You
too,

Hey,

There's
a

You

IRON
MAN:
I'm
betting
I
could
beat
that.
HELMUT
ZEMO:
Given
time.
But
then
you'd
never
know
why
you
came.
You
killed
innocent
people
in
Vienna
I've
thought
about
I
studied
you.
I
followed
you.
But
now
that
you're
standing
here...
I
just
realised...
there's
a
bit
of
green

How
nice
to
find
a
flaw.
You're
Sokovian.
Is
that
what
this
is
about?
Sokovia
was
a
failed
state
No.
I'm
here
because
I
made
a
promise.
You
lost
someone?

I
lost
everyone.
And
so
will
you.
An
empire
toppled
But
one
which
crumbles
from
within?
That's
dead.
Forever.
I
know
that
road.
What
is
this?
Help
my
wife.
Please.
Help.

Sergeant
Barnes?
MARIA:
Howard!
Howard!



No,
Tony.
Did
you
know?
I
didn't
know
it
was
him.
Don't
bullshit
me,
Rogers.
Did
you
know?
Yes.


Get
out
of
here!
It
wasn't
him,
Tony.
HYDRA
had
control
of
his
mind!
Move!
It
wasn't
him!

FRIDAY:
Left
bootjet
failing.
Flight
systems
compromised.
Ah,
crap.


He's
not
gonna
stop.
Go.

Come
on,
come
on.
FRIDAY:
Targeting
system's
I'm
eyeballing
it.



Do
you
even
remember
them?
I
remember
all
of
them.



This
isn't
gonna
change
what
happened.
I
don't
care.
He
killed
my
mom.





WOMAN:
You
should
have
Just
try,
okay?
I'm
going
to
bed.
I
love
you.
T'CHALLA:
I
almost
killed
the
wrong
man.
Hardly
an
innocent
one.
T'CHALLA:
This
is
all
you
wanted?
To
see
them
rip
each
other
apart.
My
father
lived
outside
the
city.
I
thought
we
would
be
safe
there.
My
son
was
excited.
He
could
see
the
Iron
Man
I
told
my
wife,
"Don't
worry.
"They're
fighting
in
the
city.
When
the
dust
cleared...
and
the
screaming
stopped...
it
took
me
two
days
My
father...
still
holding
my
wife
and
son
in
his
arms.
And
the
Avengers?
They
went
home.
I
knew
I
couldn't
kill
them.
More
powerful
men
than
me
have
tried.
But,
if
I
could
get
them
I'm
sorry
about
your
father.
He
seemed
a
good
man.
With
a
dutiful
son.
Vengeance
has
consumed
you.
It's
consuming
them.
I
am
done
letting
it
consume
me.
Justice
will
come
soon
enough.
Tell
that
to
the
dead.


The
living
are
not
done
with
you,
yet.

FRIDAY:
You
can't
beat
him
hand-to-hand.
Analyse
his
fight
pattern.
Scanning.
Countermeasures
ready.
Let's
kick
his
ass.


He's
my
friend.
So
was
I.

Stay
down.
Final
warning.
I
could
do
this
all
day.








That
shield
doesn't
belong
to
you.
You
don't
deserve
it.
My
father
made
that
shield!

Meals
at
8
and
5.
Toilet
privileges
twice
a
day.
Raise
your
voice,
zap.
Touch
the
glass,
zap.
You
step
out
of
line,
you
deal
with
me.
Please,
step
out
of
line,
hmm?
So
how
does
it
feel?
To
spend
all
that
time,
all
that
effort...
to
see
it
fail
so
spectacularly?
Did
it?
-
TONY:
It's
just
the
first
pass.
TONY:
Give
me
some
feedback,
Shock
absorption,
lateral
movement.
Cup
holder?
You
may
wanna
think
about
-

Let's
go.
I'll
give
you
a
hand.
No.
Don't
help
me.

Ah.

138.
138
combat
missions.
That's
how
many
I've
flown,
Tony.
Every
one
of
them
Because
the
fight
needed
to
be
fought.
It's
the
same
with
these
Accords.
I
signed
because
it
was
And
yeah,
this
sucks.
This
is,
uh...
This
is
a
bad
beat.
But
it
hasn't
changed
my
mind.
I
don't
think.

-
You
okay?

Are
you
Tony
Stank?
Yes,
this
is
Tony
Stank.
Thank
you
for
that!
Never
dropping
that,
by
the
way.
"Table
for
one,
Mr
Stank.
-
"Please,
by
the
bathroom."
STEVE:
Tony...
I'm
glad
you're
back
at
the
compound.
I
don't
like
the
idea
of
you
We
all
need
family.
The
Avengers
are
yours.
I've
been
on
my
own
since
I
was
18.
I
never
really
fit
in
anywhere,
even
in
the
Army.
My
faith's
in
people,
I
guess.
Individuals.
And
I'm
happy
to
say
that,
they
haven't
let
me
down.
Which
is
why
I
can't
let
them
down
either.
Locks
can
be
replaced,
I
know
I
hurt
you,
Tony.
I
guess
I
thought
by
not
telling
you
I
was
sparing
you...
but
I
can
see
now
that
And
I'm
sorry.
Hopefully
one
day
you
can
understand.
I
wish
we
agreed
on
the
Accords.
I
really
do.
I
know
you're
doing
what
you
believe
in,
That's
all
any
of
us
should.
FRIDAY:
Priority
call
from
Secretary
Ross.
There's
been
a
breach
at
the
Raft
prison.
Yeah,
put
him
through.
SECRETARY
ROSS:
Tony,
we
have
a
problem.
-
Uh,
please
hold.
STEVE:
So
no
matter
what...
I
promise
you...
if
you
need
us...
if
you
need
me...
I'll
be
there.

You
sure
about
this?
I
can't
trust
my
own
mind.
So,
until
they
figure
out
I
think
going
back
under
For
everybody.


Thank
you
for
this.
Your
friend
and
my
father...
they
were
both
victims.
If
I
can
help
one
of
them
find
peace...
You
know,
if
they
find
out
he's
here...
they'll
come
for
him.
Let
them
try.

MAY:
Who
was
it?
Who
hit
you?
PETER:
Some
guy.
So
itchy,
man,
God.
MAY:
What's
"some
guy's"
name?
Uh,
Steve.
Steve?
From
12-C?
-
With
the
overbite?
You
don't
know
him.
He's
from
Brooklyn.
Ouch.
Well...
I
hope
you
got
a
few
good
licks
in.
Yeah,
I
got
quite
a
few
in,
actually.
His
friend
was
huge.
Like
huge.
That's
way
better.
Thank
you.
Okay,
tough
guy.
Love
you,
May.
Hey,
can
you
shut
the
door?
