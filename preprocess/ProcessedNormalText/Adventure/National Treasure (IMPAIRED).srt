Grandpa!
You're
not
supposed
to
be
up
here,
I
just
wanted
to
know.
Well,
you're
old
enough,
I
suppose.
You
should
know
the
story.
OK,
here
we
go.
It
was
1832.
On
a
night
much
like
this.
Yah!
Charles
Carroll
was
the
last
surviving
He
was
also
a
member
And
he
knew
he
was
dying.
He
woke
up
his
stable
boy
and
ordered
him
to
take
him
to
Because
it
was
urgent
Did
he
talk
to
him?
No.
He
never
got
the
chance.
The
president
wasn't
there
that
night.
But
Charles
Carroll
had
a
secret.
So
he
took
into
his
confidence
my
grandfather's
grandfather,
Thomas
Gates.
What
was
the
secret?
A
treasure.
A
treasure
beyond
all
imagining.
A
treasure
that
had
been
by
tyrants.
Pharaohs.
And
every
time
it
changed
hands
And
then
suddenly...
it
vanished.
It
didn't
reappear
When
knights
from
the
First
Crusade
discovered
secret
vaults
You
see.
The
knights
who
found
the
vaults
believed
that
the
treasure
not
even
a
king.
They
brought
the
treasure
back
to
Europe
Over
the
next
century
and
they
formed
a
new
brotherhood
In
honor
of
War
followed.
By
the
time
of
the
American
Revolution
By
then
the
Masons
included
George
Washington.
They
knew
they
had
to
make
sure
the
treasure
would
never
fall
So
they
devised
a
series
of
clues
Over
time
the
clues
were
lost
or
forgotten,
until
only
one
remained
-
and
that
was
the
secret
that
Charles
Carroll
Charlotte.
"The
secret
lies
with
Charlotte."
Who's
Charlotte?
Oh...
not
even
Mr.
Carroll
knew
that.
Now
look
here,
Ben.
The
Freemasons
Like
these.
The
unfinished
pyramid.
Symbols
of
the
Knights
Templar,
-
They're
speaking
to
us
through
these.
You
know
what
that
dollar
represents?
The
entire
Gates
family
fortune.
Six
generations
of
fools...

It's
not
about
the
money,
Come
on,
son.
Time
to
go.
You
can...
say
your
goodbyes.
Grandpa?
Hm?
Are
we
knights?

Do
you
want
to
be?
All
right.
Um...
kneel.
Benjamin
Franklin
Gates,
you
take
upon
yourself
the
duty
and
the
family
Gates.
Do
you
so
swear?
I
so
swear.

I
was
thinking
about
crossing
this
kind
of
terrain
with
nothing
-
Can
you
imagine?

We
getting
closer?
Assuming
Ben's
theory's
correct
we
should
be
getting
very
close.
But
don't
go
by
me
-
-
It's...
it's
a
bad
omen.
Or
we
could
pull
over
OK.
Riley,
you're
not
missing
that
little
No,
no.
Absolutely
not.

Why
are
we
stopping?
-
I
don't
see
any
ship.

Look...
this
is
a
waste
of
time.
How
could
a
ship
wind
up
way
out
here?
Well,
I'm
no
expert,
but...
it
could
be
that
the
hydrothermic
properties
produce
hurricane-force
ice
storms
that
cause
the
ocean
to
freeze
resulting
in
a
semisolid
that
would
land
a
ship
right
around
here.




Hello,
beautiful.

Have
Viktor
Two
years
ago,
if
you
hadn't
shown
up,
I
don't
know
You
would
have
found
it,
I
have
no
doubt.
That's
why
I
didn't
think
it
was

I'm
just
relieved
that
I'm
not
as
crazy
-
Or
my
granddad.
Or
my
great-granddad.
OK!
Let's
go!
-
Let's
go
find
some
treasure.
Urgh.

Oh,
God!
You
handled
that
well.
This
is
it.
It's
the
cargo
hold.
Do
you
think
it's
in
the
barrels?
Gunpowder.
Ooh!
Ooh!
OK...
Why
would
the
captain
I
found
something!
What
is
it?
Do
you
guys
know
what
this
is?
Is
it
a
billion-dollar
pipe?
It's
a
meerschaum
pipe.
Look
at
the
intricacy
of
the
scrollwork
-
Is
it
a
million-dollar
pipe?
Let
me
see
that.
No,
don't
break
it!
We
are
one
step
closer
to
the
treasure,
Ben,
I
thought
you
said
that
No,
"The
secret
lies
with
Charlotte."
I
said
it
could
be
here.
It's
Templar
symbols.
"The
legend
writ."
"The
stain
effected."
"The
key
in
Silence
undetected."
"Fifty-five
in
iron
pen."
"Mr.
Matlack
can't
offend."
It's
a
riddle.
I
need
to
think.
"The
legend
writ."
"The
stain
effected."
What
legend?
There's
the
legend
of
the
Templar
treasure,
How?
"The
key
in
Silence
undetected."
Wait.
The
legend
and
the
key...
A
map.
Maps
have
legends,
maps
have
keys.
It's
a
map,
an
invisible
map.
Wait
a
minute.
What
do
you
mean,
"The
stain
effected"
used
to
bring
about
a
certain
result.
Combined
with
the
implication
is
that
the
effect
is
to
make
Unless...
Prison.
Albuquerque.
See,
I
can
do
it
too.
That's
where
the
map
is.
"Iron
pen"
is
a
prison.
Or
it
could
be,
since
the
primary
writing
the
"pen"
is...
just
a
pen.
But
then
why
not
say
a
pen?
'Cause
it's
a
prison.
Wait
a
minute.
"Iron
pen"
-
the
"iron"
it
describes
what
was
penned.
It
was
"iron"
-
No,
no,
no,
that's
stupid.
It
was...
It
was
firm,
It
was
resolved.
"Mr.
Matlack
can't
offend."
Timothy
Matlack
was
the
official
scribe
Calligrapher,
not
writer.
And
to
make
sure
it
was
put
on
the
back
of
a
resolution
a
resolution
that
55
men
signed.
The
Declaration
of
Independence.
Oh!
Come
on,
there's
no
invisible
map
on

That's
clever,
really.
would
ensure
the
map's
survival.
And
you
said
there
were
several
Masons
Yeah.
Nine,
for
sure.
We'll
have
to
arrange
a
way
to
examine
it.
This
is
one
of
the
most
important
They're
not
just
gonna
let
us
waltz
in
there
-
Then
what
do
you
propose
we
do?
We
could
borrow
it.
Steal
it?
-
I
don't
think
so.
the
treasure
of
the
Knights
Templar
Oh,
I
didn't
know
that.
Look,
Ben...
I
understand
your
bitterness.
You've
spent
your
entire
life
only
to
have
treat
you
and
your
family
You
should
be
able
to
rub
this
treasure
and
I
want
you
to
have
How?
We
all
have
our
areas
of
expertise.
You
don't
think
mine
are
limited
In
another
life...
I
arranged
a
number
of
operations
of...
I'd
take
his
word
for
it,
if
I
were
you.
So
don't
worry.
No.
I'd
really
need
your
help
here.
Ian...
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
steal
OK.
From
this
point
on
Hey!
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Well,
you
can't
shoot
me.
Information
you
don't
have.
I
do.
I'm
the
only
one
who
can
figure
it
out,
He's
bluffing.
We
played
poker
together,
Ian.
Tell
me
what
I
need
to
know,
Ben,
or
I'll
shoot
your
friend.
Hey!
Quiet,
Riley!
Look
where
you're
standing.
You
shoot
me,
Ben...
What
happens
when
the
flare
burns
down?
Tell
me
what
I
need
to
know,
Ben.
You
need
to
know...
if
Shaw
can
catch.
Nice
try,
though.
Get
out,
Shaw!
Fool!
Riley,
get
over
here!
-
What
is
this?
Move!
Get
out
of
here!
-
What?
Follow
me.
Let's
go,
let's
go!
Get
down.
OK,
let's
go.

There's
an
Inuit
village
-
It's
popular
with
bush
pilots.

-
Then
what
are
we
gonna
do?
No,
I
meant
about
Ian.
He's
gonna
steal
We
stop
him.

Is
it
really
so
hard
to
believe
that
someone's
gonna
try
to
steal

The
FBI
gets
10,000
tips
a
week.
They're
not
gonna
worry
about
But
anyone
that
can
do
anything
Anyone
crazy
enough
to
believe
us
We
don't
need
someone
crazy.
But
one
Obsessed.
Passionate.
Excuse
me.
-
Dr.
Chase
can
see
you
now,
Mr.
Brown.

Mr.
Brown?
The
family
name
doesn't
get
a
lot
Huh.
Being
kept
down
by
the
man.
A
very
cute
man.
Thank
you.
-
Good
afternoon,
gentlemen.
-
Abigail
Chase.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Bill.
-
How
may
I
help
you?
-
Saxony
German.
-
You're
not
American?
I
just
wasn't
born
here.
Sorry.
A
neat
collection.
You're
missing
the
1789
inaugural,
though.
-
I
found
one
once.
Now,
you
told
my
assistant
Ah.
Yes,
ma'am.
Well,
I'm
gonna
get
straight
to
the
point.
Someone's
gonna
steal
It's
true.
I
think
I'd
better
put
you
gentlemen
-
We've
been
to
the
FBI.
They
assured
us
that
the
Declaration
-
They're
right.
However,
if
we
were
given
the
privilege
we
would
be
able
to
tell
you
for
certain
What
do
you
think
you're
gonna
find?
We
believe
that
there's
an...
-
An
encryption,
like
a
code?
Of
what?
Uh...
a
cartograph.
-
A
map.
A
map
of
what?
The
location
of...

...of
hidden
items
-
A
treasure
map?
You're
treasure-hunters,
aren't
you?
We're
more
like
treasure-protectors.
Mr.
Brown,
I
have
personally
seen
the
back
and
I
promise
you,
the
only
thing
there
"Original
Declaration
of
Independence,
"Four
of
July,
1776."
Yes,
ma'am.
But
no
map.

It's
invisible.
Oh!
Right.
And
that's
where
we
lost
What
led
you
to
assume
We
found
an
engraving
Owned
by
Freemasons.

May
I
see
the
pipe?

Did
Big
Foot
take
it?
Nice
to
meet
you,
too.
And,
you
know,
Must
have
taken
you
a
long
time
If
it's
any
consolation,
It's
not.
I
was
thinking,
what
if
we
go
public,
It's
not
like
Although
I
don't
think
180
years
of

Of

gonna

What?
I'm
gonna
steal
Uh...
Ben?

This
is...
huge.
It's
prison
huge.
You
are
gonna
go
to
prison,
Yeah,
probably.
So
that
would
bother
most
people.
Ian's
gonna
try
and
steal
it.
And
if
he
The
fact
is,
the
only
way
to
protect
It's
upside
down.
I
don't
think
there's
a
choice.
Ben,
for
God's
sakes,
it's
like
stealing
a
national
monument.
OK?
It's
like
stealing
him.
It
can't
be
done.
Not
shouldn't
be
done.
Let
me
prove
it
to
you.
OK,
Ben,
pay
attention.
I've
brought
you
to
the
Library
of
Congress.
Why?
Because
it's
the
biggest
library
Over
20
million
books.
And
they're
all
saying
Listen
to
Riley.
What
we
have
here,
my
friend,
Short
of
builders'
blueprints.
You've
got
construction
orders,
water
and
sewage
-
Now,
when
the
Declaration
it
is
surrounded
by
guards
and
a
little
family
from
Iowa
and
little
kids
And
beneath
an
inch
of
bulletproof
glass
that
will
go
off
if
someone
gets
too
close
Now,
when
it's
not
on
display,
it
is
lowered
into
a
four-foot-thick
that
happens
to
be
equipped
and
biometric
access-denial
systems.
You
know,
Thomas
Edison
tried
and
failed
to
develop
the
carbonized
cotton-thread
Edison?
When
asked
about
it,
I
found
out
2,000
ways
But
he
only
needed
to
find
one
way
The
Preservation
Room.
Do
you
know
Delicious
jams
and
jellies?
No.
That's
where
they
clean,
all
the
documents
when
they're
not
on
display
or
in
the
vault.
Now,
when
the
case
needs
work
they
take
and
into
the
Preservation
Room.
The
best
time
for
us.
Or
Ian.
To
steal
it
when
the
guards
are
distracted
But
we'll
make
our
way
to
the
Preservation
Huh.
Well,
if
Ian...
Uh...
Preservation...
Hm.
The
gala,
huh?
This
might
be
possible.
It
might.
Ah...
And
we
are
in.
There
you
are.
The

That's
what
I
want.

I'll

do
you
want?
Bad,
bad,
bad!
-
Let
me
go!
No!
No!
-
That's...

And
just
who
might
you
be?
-
Once
we
catch
them
what
do
we
do?
Right
turn,
right
turn.
Why
don't
you
just
pass
me
that

Oh,
no.
Skidding,
skidding,
skidding.
-
Oh,
no!
-
Help!
Get
me
next
to
her.

-
Thank
you.
Got
it.
Go
on.
Abigail!
-
Come
on.
Jump.
-
We
lost
them.
Well
done,
Gates.
Well
done.
-

Are
you
all
right?
-
You're
not
hurt,
are
you?
-
Are
you
hungry?
Are
you
all
right?
Still
a
little
on
edge
from
being
shot
at,
Yeah,
well,
I'm
not
all
right.
Those
men
-
She
lost
it?!
See?
OK?
-
Give
me
that!
You'd
do
well,
Dr.
Chase,
If
this
is
the
real
one,
what
did
they
get?
A
souvenir.
I
thought
it'd
be
a
good
idea
to
have
I
actually
had
to
pay
for
the
souvenir
and
-
Genius.
Just
the
guys
we
warned
you
And
you
didn't
believe
us.
We
did
the
only
thing
we
could
do
Verdammt!
Give
me
that!
You
know
something?
I'm
pretty
sure
she
was
swearing,
too.
Well,
we
probably
deserve
that.

Ladies
and
gentlemen...
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
my
name
is
I
wanna
reassure
you,
If
we
all
cooperate,
we'll
get
through
this
Thank
you.
Get
positive
IDs.
Search
everyone,
If
they
refuse,
-

Um...
-
This
isn't
a
day
for
"Um..."
that
someone
was
going
to
steal
Do
we
have
a
name
on
the
tipster?
There
was
no
file
opened.
How
about
now?
There
is
not
a
treasure
map
on
the
back
And
there's
no
chance
I
leveled
with
you
100
percent.
I
want
that
document,
Mr.
Brown.
OK,
my
name's
not
Brown.
I
leveled
with
you
98
percent.
Wait
a
minute,
did
you
just
say
"Gates"?
Gates?
You're
that
family
with
the
conspiracy
-
It's
not
a
conspiracy
theory.
You
know
what?
I
take
it
back.
There's
a
copy
of
the
Declaration
-
Yes,
we
decided
to...
The
guests
know
something
happened,
They
got
him
with
a
Taser
at
the
service
Also,
we
found
bullet
casings.
Did
we
get
a
description
-
Which
guards?
There
weren't
any
other
guards
So...
who
was
shooting,
and
why
weren't
they
getting
along?
You
can't
seriously
intend
on
the
Declaration
of
Independence
We
have
a
clean-room
environment
EDS
suits,
a
particulate
air
filtration
-
Really?
What?
Why
not?
This
is
the
guy.
Dr.
Herbert
said
Not
on
the
guestlist.
Now,
the
gift-store
clerk
-
she
said
He
tried
to
walk
out
with
a
copy
without
paying.
He
paid
with
a
Visa.
"Charge
to
Benjamin
Gates."
A
credit-card
slip?
Dude,
we're
on
the
grid.
They'll
have
your
records
from
forever.
I
know.
I
know.
It's
only
a
matter
of
minutes
What
do
we
do?
-
We
need
those
letters.

You
know,
get
off
the
road,

What
letters?
You
have
the
original
Silence
Dogood
We
have
scans
of
the
originals.
-
Quiet,
please.
Oh,
I
know
the
person
-
Why
do
you
need
them?
I'll
tell
you
what,
look.
if
you'll
promise
to
shut
up,
please.
Thank
you.
-
Ben,
you
know
what
you
have
to
do.
I'm
just
trying
to
think
Well,
not
to
be
a,
uh,
nudge,
but
you
do
realize
how
many
people
We
probably
have
It
took
you
all
of
two
seconds
to
decide
Yeah,
but
I
didn't
think
I
was
gonna
Hey,
not
cool!
Not
cool!
Let
me
go!
OK.
You're
let
go.
Go,
shoo.
I'm
not
going.
Not
without
the
Declaration.
You're
not
going
with
the
Declaration.
Yes,
I
am.
I'm
not
letting
it
Wait.
You're
not
going
with
us
-
Yes,
I
am.
Look,
if
you
wanted
to
leave
me
behind,
you
shouldn't
have
told
me


Clear.
What
the...

Now
we're
getting
somewhere.

They're
digital
scans
of
letters
Written
1722.
They're
all
from
the
same
person.
Gentlemen...
why
is
this
word
capitalized?
Because
it's
important?
Because
it's
a
name.
OK,
I
got
it.
he
secretly
wrote
14
letters
pretending
to
be
a
middle-aged
widow
These
letters
were
written

Looks
OK.
-
Park
a
couple
of
blocks
away.
I'm
gonna
give
them
a
couple
of
hours
What
do
we
do
about
her?

No,
that
won't
be
necessary.
-
Promise
you
won't
be
any
trouble.
See?
She's
curious.
Here's
what
I
got
on
Gates.
A
degree
a
degree
in
Mechanical
Engineering
Navy
ROTC
and
Naval
Diving
Hm.
What
in
the
world
did
this
guy
We
keep
our
focus
on
Gates.
Run
him
to
ground.
Compile
a
family-and-friends
list.
I
want
to
find
out
who
this
guy
is.

Dad.
Where's
the
party?
Uh,
well,
uh...
I'm
in
a
little
trouble.
-
Is
she
pregnant?
are
you
gonna
leave
the
woman
carrying
I
look
pregnant?
This
better
not
be
about
Well,
have
a
seat.
There's
some
pizza.
Dad...
I
need
the
Silence
Dogood
letters.
And
he
dragged
you
two
-
Literally.
Well,
unvolunteer,
-
Knock
it
off,
Dad.
I
have
a
job,
a
house,
health
insurance.
At
least
I
had
your
mother,
for
however
What
do
you
have?
Him?
Look,
if
you
just
give
us
the
letters,
You
disappoint
me,
Ben.
Well,
maybe
that's
the
real
Gates-family
Get
out.
Take
your
troubles
with
you.
I
found
the
Charlotte.
The
Charlotte?
-
You
mean
she
was
a
ship?
It
was
amazing,
Dad.
And
the
treasure?
No,
no.
But
we
found
another
clue
Yeah,
and
that'll
lead
you
And
that's
all
you'll
ever
find,
I
finally
figured
it
out.
The
legend
says
that
the
treasure
But
what
really
happened
to
keep
the
British
occupied
The
treasure
is
a
myth.
I
refuse
to
believe
that.
Well,
you
can
believe
what
you
want.
Do
what
you
want,
Ben.
He's
probably
right.
You
don't
even
know
Well,
I
can
think
of
a
way
where
we
could
Looks
like
animal
skin.
-
How
old
is
it?
-
Really?
You
sure?
Now
if
this
thing's
in
invisible
ink,
Throw
it
in
the
oven.
-

No.
Ferrous
sulfate
inks
can
only
-
Yes,
but
this...
This
is
very
old,
and
we
can't
You
need
a
reagent.
Dad,
it's
really
late.
I'm
fine.
Lemons.
-
You
can't
do
that.
Then
someone
who
is
trained
to
handle
OK.
OK.
Now,
uh,
if
there
is
a
secret
message,
it'll
probably
be
marked
by
a
symbol
That's
right.
I
am
so
getting
fired
for
this.
I
told
you.
You
need
heat.

See?
-
We
need
more
juice.
That's
not
a
map.
-
Is
it?

Are
those
latitudes
and
longitudes?
That's
why
we
need
-
That's
the
key?
Dad,
can
we
have
the
letters
now?
Will
somebody
please
explain
to
me
-
It's
an
Ottendorf
cipher.
Oh,
OK.
-
What's
an
Ottendorf
cipher?
Each
of
these
three
numbers
Usually
a
random
book

In
this
case,
So
it's
like
the
page
number
the
line
on
the
page,
So,
Dad,
where
are
the
letters?
You
know,
it's
just
by
sheer
happenstance
-
Dad.
They
were
in
an
antique
desk
-
Dad.
-
That's
a
newspaper.
I
don't
have
them,
son.
-
What?

Where
are
they?
I
donated
them
to
the
Franklin
Institute
Time
to
go.
I
still
can't
believe
it.
All
this
time
-
The
back
of
what?
No!
-
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
What
have
you
done?
-
I
know!
Yes.
And
it's
very
delicate.
You
stole
it?
Dad,
I
can
explain,
but
I
don't
have
time.
And
that
will
lead
to
another
clue,
There
is
no
treasure.
And
now
you've
destroyed
yours.
And
you
pulled
me
into
all
this.
Well,
we
can't
have
that.



Come
in!
I'm
in
here.
FBI,
right?
You
gonna
untie
me?
And
you
have
no
idea
where
he's
going?
-
Well,
wouldn't
I
have
told
you
if
I
did?
He
tied
me
to
a
chair.
The
garage
is
empty,
but
there's
a
Cadillac
And
he
stole
my
car.
Don't
worry,
Mr.
Gates,
we'll
find
your
car.
Your
dad's
got
a
sweet
ride.
I
think
we
should
change
clothes.
We
look
kind
of
conspicuous,
I'd
love
to
go
shopping,
too,
Here,
I
took
this
from
his
house.
He
usually
tucks
a
few
hundred
dollars
-
Common
Sense.
How
appropriate.
I'm
hungry.
This
car
smells
weird.


Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Oops,
sorry,
sir.
Excuse
me.
That's
OK.

S-S-A-N-D.

OK.
Huh.
You're
sure
this
is
right?
OK.
S-S-A...
No,
N.
-
That
is
an
N.
You
know
what?
Here.
Last
one.
OK?
-
One
more
dollar.
Go
get
the
last
four
letters.
Go
get
'em,
chief.
Come
on.
OK.
"The
vision
to
see
the

as
the
timely

"Pass
and..."
what?
"Pass
and..."
What's
going
on?
-
I'm
not
sure.

So
you
show
up
at
your
father's
and
the
first
thing
he
assumes
Is
there
a
question
in
there?
I
think
there's
an
interesting
story
Well,
my
father
thinks
I've
been
-
I
see.
Have
you
ever
told
someone
-
Yes.
More
than
one
someone?
Yes.
Oh.
Well,
then
my
father
would
say
you've
been
a
little
too
cavalier
So
you
get
your
sense
of
absolute
certainty
Well,
I'm
sure
I
don't
know
Well,
you're
certain
the
treasure
is
real,
No,
but
I
hope
it's
real.
I
mean,
I've
dreamt
it's
real
But
I
want
to
hold
it.
But
I
just...
I
just
want
to
know
it's
not
just
People
don't
really
talk
that
way,
you
know.
I
know.
But
they
think
that
way.
Hey.
-
Did
you
get
it?
Riley?
"The

I
thought
the

was
the

No,
the

a

the
way
to

the

can
be
found
where

so

Wait
a
minute,
wait.
Excuse
me,
can
I
see
one
of
those
No.
Oh.
Well,
uh,
here,
It's
called
a
Submariner.
I
dive

it.

You
can

as
collateral.

you.

you.

friend

Fascinating.
OK.
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
Now,
I
think
that
if
we
look
...we
may
find
the
specific
time.
-

What
do
you
see?
-
What
time
is
it
now?
-
We
missed
it.
We
didn't
miss
it
because...
uh...
You
don't
know
this?
I-I
know
something
I'd
be
very
excited
to
learn
about
it,
Riley.
Well,
hold
on
one
second,
let
me
just...
This
is...
this
is
cool.
Is
this
how
you
feel
all
the
time?
Because,
-
Riley!
What
I
know
is
that
daylight
savings
If
it's
3pm
now,
OK,
that
means
-
Let's
go.
Yeah.
Do
you
actually
know
who
the
first
person
-

Benjamin
Franklin.
Is
this
real?
Just
tell
me
what
you
told
my
friend.
Just
a
bunch
of
letters.
Can
you
remember
which
ones
Yeah,
here.
S-T-O-W.

Liberty
Bell

Imagine
its
impact
It
could
have
been
seen
for
miles
around,
because
it
served
as
a
beacon,
as
it
were,
for
people
to
collect
and
hear...
Good
stuff.

It
was
in
1846,
that
the

the

Me.
It's
not
here.
It's
there.
Come
on.

What
bell
is
this?
It
replaced
the

Bell
in
1876.

There
it

All
right.
I'm
gonna
go
down
there,

OK?
All
right.
All
right,
let's
go.
3:22.
My
idea.
Hey.
What'd
you
score?
I
found
this.
Some
kind
of
ocular
device.
"The
vision
to
see
the
treasured
past."
Aw,
they're
like
early
American
Benjamin
Franklin
invented
Uh...
I
think
he
invented
these.
So,
what
do
we
do
with
them?
We
look
through
it.
-

Here,
help
me.
-

Careful.
Whoo...
-
What?
it
was
being
signed.
-
Ben,
there's
another
tour
coming.
-
Careful.


What
do
you
see?
What
is
it?
Is
it
a
treasure
map?
It
says,
"Heere
at
the
wall,"
Take
a
look.

Ah.

Wow.
Why
can't
they
just
say,
"Go
to
this
place,

Oh,
no.
-
Oh,
no.
How'd
they
find
us?
Well,
Ian
has
nearly
unlimited
resources.

I
don't
think
we
can
get
out
Well,
we
don't
want
them
to
have
But
we
especially
don't
want
them

So
what
do
we
do?

We're
splitting
up.
Really?
I'll
take

And
those.

keep

he
is.

as
long

you
like.
Oh,

you.
Thank
you.
You
want
something?

you
want
something?
I
see
why
you
left
him.
Go
around.
Go
around.

were
you?
Come

Ow!

Whoa!
They're
headed
for
the

I'll
be
right
there.
Hey,

Enough,
man!
Give
me
the
document.
All
right,

Watch
out!
Get
out
of

it!


Leave

You
all
right?
Yeah,

we're
all
right.

I'm
sorry.
Meet

Suspect
has
arrived.
Hello,
Mr.

Mr.

face
your

We
got
one
in
custody.
Could
you
please
be
careful?
Riley,
do
you
know
Excuse
me?
That's
some
story.
Well,
it's
the
same
story
I
tried
to
tell
you
-
By
you.
I
did
it
alone.
And
Ian
still
ended
up
with

of
you.

your

us
find
it,
and
you
still
but
you
feel
better
inside.
Is
there
a
door
that
doesn't
lead
to
prison?
-
Someone's
got
to
go
to
prison,
Ben.
So
what
are
these
for?
It's
a
way
to
read
the
map.
Right.
Knights
Templar.
Freemasons.
Invisible
treasure
map.
-
So
what'd
it
say?
Nothing
else.
It's
just
another
clue.

It
looks
like
Ian
Howe

Follow
up
with
ATF
and
INS.
-
There's
more
to
it.
-
Standard
tap
procedure.
-
Lock
it
in.
-
Checking
source.

Yes.

Hello.
Ben.
How
are
you?
-
Um,
chained
to
a
desk.
I
want
you
to
meet
me
on
the
flight
deck
-
You
know
where
that
is?
Meet
me
there
at
ten
o'clock
And
bring
those
glasses
Yeah.
I
know
about
the
glasses.
We
can
take
a
look
at
the
Declaration,
And
I'm
supposed
to
believe
that.
I
told
you
from
the
start.
You
can
have
it.
And
the
glasses.
I'll
even
throw
in
the
pipe
I'll
be
there.
And
tell
the
FBI
agents
if
they
want
the
Declaration
back.
Then
you'll
come
alone.
-

Take
positions.
-

Can
I
get
a
status
report?

Copy
that.
-
Gates
is
on
the
flight
deck.
-
Do
not
lose
sight
of
primary
mark.
-
I
have
a
visual.
Stay
with
the
program.
I
hope
your
agents
are
all
under
four
feet
Otherwise
Ian's
gonna
know
they're
here.
As
soon
as
he
shows
you
the
Declaration.
Don't
try
anything.
You
know,
Agent
Sadusky,
It
never
works
out
so
well
for
the
bait.
Sir,
we've
got
some
traffic
incoming.
Unit
two,
Agent
Michaels,
get
FAA
flight
plans
If
that's
not
Mr.
Howe,
-
I
got
him.
He's
coming
from
the
north.
Well,
I'm
sure
not
against
you,


We've
got
some
interference
This
I
know.

Hello,
Ben.
Thomas
Edison
needed
only
one
way
Sound
familiar?
-
Keep
sightlines
clear.
There's
a
lot
of
commotion.
Go
to
the
starboard
observation
point

Gates?
Gates?

Air
Tour
helicopter.
Vacate
immediately.

Who's
got
Gates?
-
All
agents.
Report
in.
-

Did
Gates
speak
to
anybody?
-
He's
heading
towards
the
stern.
Anyone
got
a
view
of
our
friend
Ian
Howe?
Ian
Howe
is
not
at
the
stern,
sir.
Then
why
is
he
heading
there?
He's
at
the
observation
deck.
Sadusky.
I'm
still
not
against
you.
But
I
found
door
number
three.
-
What's
he
talking
about?
Move
in!
Move
in
on
Gates!
Divers
are
a
go.
-
Snipers,
go
to
action
zebra.
-
I
repeat.
Pursue
at
own
risk.
Holy
mackerel.
He
set
us
up.

Agent
Dawes.
Do
you
have
Sir,
it's
the
Hudson.
Nothing
is
visible.
Smart
fish.
Hello,
Ben.
Welcome
to
New
Jersey.
-
What'd
you
do
with
Abigail
and
Riley?
We
had
to
guess
your
sizes.
I
said,
what'd
you
do
He's
the
only
one
who
could've
Did
you
bring
the
glasses?
I
don't
know.
Ask
your
girlfriend.
She's
the
one
calling
all
the
shots
now.
She
won't
shut
up.

Yeah,
hello.
It's
for
you.
-
Hello.
Uh.
Interesting.
Dear.
So,
what,
you
working
with
Ian
now?
It
turns
out
helping
someone
escape
And
he's
the
only
criminal
we
knew.
-
So
we
called
him
and
made
a
deal.

You're...
you're...
you're
all
right,
yeah?
Yeah,
we
both
are.
Riley's
right
here,
doing
I'm
tracking
him
through
the...
Hey!
I'm
tracking
you
through
the
GPS
They
take
a
turn
anywhere
we
don't
want,
If
Ian
tries
to
double-cross
us,
we
can
call
-
And
where
to
find
Ian.
Right
across
the
street
at
the
intersection
Well,
you
figured
out
the
clue.
Simple.
"Heere
at
the
wall."
Ben,
there
is
a
catch.
We
made
Ian
believe
It
was
the
only
way
He's
here.

Here
we
go.
Ben.
You
all
right?
No
broken
bones?
Naw,
it
was
cool.
The
Declaration
of
Independence.
All
yours.
-
That's
it?
I
knew
you'd
keep
your
promise.
It's
right
here.
The
map
said
"Heere
at
the
wall,"
Wall
Street
follows
the
path
that
the
original
Dutch
settlers
built
The
main
gate
was
located
at
a
street
Later
De
Heere
Street
was
renamed
So,
"Heere
at
the
wall."
Broadway,
Wall
Street.

Cheerio.
Just
a
moment,
Ben.
Ian,
if
you
break
our
deal,
the
FBI
You
might
get
away,
you
might
not.
Is
that
all
the
map
said?
Every
word.
Oh,
Ben.
You
know
the
key
Every
once
in
a
while
Dad.
Is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
tell
me?
Trinity
Church.
We
have
to
go
Good.
Excellent.
Well,
why
don't
you
ask
Dr.
Chase
I'm
sure
they're
around
here
somewhere.
Are
you
all
right?
What
do
you
think?
I'm
a
hostage.
Sit.
Sit
down.
-
Let
him
go,
Ian.
No,
now.
Or
you
can
figure
out
Good
luck.
Ben.
I
don't
think
you
fully
appreciate
Let's
have
a
look
at
that
map.
It's,
uh...
It's...
it's
really
quite
something.
It's,
uh...
It
really
is
remarkable.
Take
a
look.
-

"Parkington
Lane."
But
why
would
the
map
lead
us
here,
-
What's
the
purpose?
Dad.
No,
you're
right.
Parkington
Lane
A
street
inside
the
church?
Not
inside.
Beneath.
Beneath
the
church.
-
I'm
so
sorry,
Ben.
-
I
co...
Look.
Cooperation
only
lasts
as
long
As
soon
as
this
guy
gets
to
wherever
this
Or...
or
any
of
us.
So
we
find
a
way
to
make
sure
-
How?
Well,
I
guess
I
better
Hey!
Par...
Hey,
I
found
it!
-
Him!
It's
a
name.
Parkington
Lane.
He
was
a
third-degree
master
mason
Hey!
Stop!
Easy.
-
Whoa!
Careful
no
one
steps
in
him.
All
right,
put
it
down.
OK.
Who
wants
to
go
down
Right.
McGregor,
Viktor,
you
stay
here.
And
if
anyone
should
come
out
without
me,
Shall
we?
You
got
a
light?

Careful.
Watch
your
step.
Come
here.
Why
does
that
never
happen
to
me?
What's
this?
It's
a
chandelier.
Here.
-

Wow.

A
dumbwaiter
system.
How
do
a
bunch
of
guys
with
hand
tools
Same
way
they
built
the
pyramids
Yeah.
The
aliens
helped
them.
Right,
let's
go.
What
are
we
waiting
for?
I'm
not
going
out
on
that
thing.
Dad,
do
what
he
says.

Watch
your
step.
We're
right
under
the
Trinity
graveyard.
That's
probably
why

What
is
that?

Subway.
Shaw!
Oh,
God,
Shaw!


Oh,
my
God.
Hold
on!
Hold
on!
OK,
get
on
the
elevator.
Jump!

Ben!
Grab
my
hand.
-
Come
on.
Abigail!
Get
on!
Jump!
Here.

Ben!
Get
down
there.
The
Declaration.
-
Do
you
trust
me?
Oh,
no!
Ben!
Oh!
Hang
on!
Son!
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry
I
dropped
you.
No,
don't
be.
I
would
have
done
Really?
I
would
have
dropped
you
both.
Get
on.
Ian...
it's
not
worth
it.
Do
you
imagine
any
one
of
your
lives
We
go
on.
The
status
quo.
-

Now
what?
This
is
where
it
all
leads.
OK,
let's
go.
What
is
this?
So
where's
the
treasure?
Well?
This
is
it?
We
came
all
this
way
Yes.

-
There's
gotta
be
something
more.
-
Another
clue,
or...
That's
it,
OK?
It's
over!
End
of
the
road.
The
treasure's
gone.
You're
not
playing
games
with
me,
You
know
where
it
is.
No.
OK,
go.
Hey,
wait
a
minute.
-

Hey!
Ian,
wait!
-

Ian...
-

Don't
do
this.
Yes,
I
can.
There
isn't
another
clue.
Ian,
why
don't
you
come
back
down
here
-
Don't
speak
again.
The
clue.
Where's
the
treasure?
Ben?
-
The
lantern.
The
status
quo
has
changed,
son.
Don't.
It's
part
of
freemason
teachings.
In
King
Solomon's
temple
It
signified
the
journey
that
had
to
be
made
-
The
lantern
is
the
clue.
Boston.
It's
Boston.
The
Old
North
Church
in
Boston,
where
Thomas
Newton
to
signal
Paul
Revere
that
the
British
One
lantern.
Under
the
winding
staircase
-
Thank
you.
Why?
So
you
can
escape
in
Boston?
Besides,
with
you
out
of
the
picture
What
if
we
lied?
Did
you?
What
if
there's
another
clue?
Then
I'll
know
right
where
to
find
you.
See
you,
Ben.
-
No!
-

Come
back!
We're
all
gonna
die.
It's
gonna
be
OK,
Riley.
It's
OK,
kiddo.
OK,
boys,
what's
going
on?
The
British
Ian
needed
another
clue,
It
was
a
fake.
The
all-seeing
eye.
"Through
the
all-seeing
eye."
That
means...
by
the
time
Ian
we'll
still
be
trapped,
Either
way,
we're
gonna
die.
Nobody's
gonna
die.
Where?
Through
the
treasure
room.
Here.
Riley.
Looks
like
someone
got
here
first.
I'm
sorry,
Ben.
It's
gone.
-
Listen,
Ben...
before
Charles
Carroll
It
doesn't
matter.
I
know.
'Cause
you
were
right.
No,
I
wasn't
right.
This
room
is
real,
Ben.
And
that
means
the
treasure
is
real.
We're
in
the
company
of
because
you
found
and
understood
the
meaning
of
it.
You
did
it,
Ben.
For
all
of
us.
Your
grandfather,
and
all
of
us.
And
I've
never
been
so
happy
I
just...
really
thought
OK.
Then
we
just
keep
looking
for
it.
I'm
in.
OK.
Not
to
be
Johnny
Rain
Cloud
here,
Because
as
far
as
I
can
see,

Yeah.

Now,
Ben,
Well,
that's
it.
because
the
first
thing
the
builders
was
cut
a
secondary
shaft
back
out
for
air...
-
Right.
Could
it
really
be
that
simple?
"The
secret
lies
with
Charlotte."

Scrolls
from
the
library
at
Alexandria.
Could
this
be
possible?

It's
a
big...
bluish-green
man,
with
a
strange-looking
goatee.
I'm
guessing
that's
significant.
Yes!
Riley,
are
you
crying?
Look.
Stairs.


Hi.
Do
you
have
a
cell
phone
I
could
borrow?
-
Just
like
that?
You
do
know
you
just
handed
me
The
Declaration
of
Independence
Not
to
me.
Have
a
seat.
-
So
what's
your
offer?
How
about
a
bribe?
Say,
uh...
ten
billion
dollars?
I
take
it
you
found
the
treasure?
It's
about
five
stories
Hm.
You
know,
the
Templars
that
the
treasure
was
too
great
That's
why
they
went
to
such
lengths
That's
right.
The
Founding
Fathers
believed
I
figure
their
solution
Give
it
to
the
people.
Divide
it
amongst
the
Smithsonian,
There's
thousands
of
years
And
it
belongs
to
the
world,
You
really
don't
understand
OK,
here's
what
I
want.
not
even
a
little
Post-it
OK.
I
want
the
credit
for
the
find
with
the
assistance
of
Mr.
Riley
Poole.
And
what
about
you?
I'd
really
love
not
to
go
to
prison.
I
can't
even
begin
to
describe
Someone's
got
to
go
to
prison,
Ben.
Well,
if
you've
got
a
helicopter,
-

Freeze!
FBI!
-
Freeze!
Don't
move!
-
Put
your
hands
up.
You're
under
arrest,
Mr.
Howe.
We've
got
you
on
kidnapping,
and
trespassing
on
government
property.
Yeah.
You
got
it,
chief.
They
want
us
in
Cairo
next
week
They're
sending
a
private
jet.
That's
fun.
Yeah,
big
whoop.
We
could
have
had
Ten
percent,
Ben.
They
offered
you
Riley,
we've
been
over
this.
I
still
have
this
splinter
that's
been
festering
OK,
I'll
tell
you
what.
Next
time
we
find
a
treasure
you
make
the
call
on
the
finder's
fee.
That's
not
as
funny.
What
do
you
care?
-
It's
true.
Rub
it
in.
while
I
sit
on
one
percent.
One
stinkin'
percent.
One
percent.
Unbelievable.
I'm
sorry
for
your
suffering,
Riley.
For
the
record,
Ben,
You
know,
I
chose
this
estate
Yeah,
someone
that
did
something
Could
have
had
a
bigger
house.

-
I
made
something
for
you.
-
A
map.
Where
does
it
lead
to?
You'll
figure
it
out.
