What

Hello,
I

I
could
be
mistaken.
They're
using
a
very
I
do
believe
they
think

Haaaar!
Why
don't
you
use
and
get
us
out
of
this?
I
beg
your
pardon,
General
Solo,
Proper?
It's
against
to
impersonate
a
deity.
Why,
you...

they
you'll
become

But,
Master

what
magic?
Just
tell
them.

Boom!

what's

do
you

Just

She
died
when
What
do
you
remember?
Just
images,

Feelings.
Tell
me.
She
was...
very
beautiful.
Kind...
but
sad.
Why
are
you
I
have
no
memory
I
never
knew
her.
Luke,
tell
me...
what's
troubling
you?
Vader
is
here.
Now.
On
this
moon.
How
do
you
know?
I
felt
his
presence.
He's
come
for
me.
He
can
feel
when
I'm
near.
That's
why
I
have
to
go.
As
long
as
I
stay...
I'm
endangering
the
group
I
have
to
face
him.
Why?
He's
my
father.
Your
father?
There's
more.
It
won't
be
easy
for
you
to
hear
it,
If
I
don't
make
it
back...
you're
the
only
hope
Don't
talk
that
way.
You
have
a
power
and
could
never
have.
You're
wrong,
Leia.
You
have
In
time,
you'll
learn
The
Force
is
strong
My
father
has
it.
I
have
it.
And...
my
sister
has
it.
Yes.
It's
you,
Leia.
I
know.
Somehow...
I've
always
known.
Then
you
know
why
No!
Luke,
run
away.
If
he
can
feel
then
leave
this
place.
I
wish
I
could
go
with
you.
No,
you
don't.
You've
always
But
why
must
you
Because...
I've
felt
it.
He
won't
turn
me
over
I
can
save
him.
I
can
turn
him
back
I
have
to
try.
Hey,
what's
going
on?
Nothing.
I
just
want
to
be
alone
Nothing?
Come
on,
tell
me.
What's
going
on?
I...
I
can't
tell
you.
Could
you
tell
Luke?
Is
that
I...
Ah.
I'm
sorry.
Hold
me.
This
is
the
rebel
Although
he
denies
it,
I
believe
and
I
request
permission
He
was
armed
Good
work,
Commander.
Leave
us.
Conduct
your
search...
and
bring
Yes,
my
lord.
The
emperor
I
know,
Father.
So,
you
have
accepted
the
truth.
I've
accepted
the
truth...
that
you
were
once
That
name
no
longer
It
is
the
name
of
your
true
self.
I
know
there
is
good
The
emperor
hasn't
That
was
why
you
That's
why
you
won't
bring
me
I
see
you
have
constructed
Your
skills
are
complete.
Indeed
you
are
powerful...
as
the
emperor
has
foreseen.
Come
with
me.
Obi-Wan
once
thought
You
don't
know
the
power
I
must
obey
my
master.
I
will
not
turn...
and
you'll
be
forced
to
kill
me.
If
that
is
your
destiny.
Search
your
feelings,
Father.
You
can't
do
this.
I
feel
the
conflict
within
you.
Let
go
of
your
hate.
It
is
too
late
for
me,
son.
The
emperor
will
show
you...
the
true
nature
of
the
Force.
He
is
your
master
now.
Then
my
father
is
truly
dead.
Urrr.
The

Yes.
All
