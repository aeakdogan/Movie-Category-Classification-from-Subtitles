No
one
would
have
believed
that
our
world
was
being
watched
That
as
men
busied
themselves
they
observed
and
studied...
the
way
a
man
with
the
microscope
the
creatures
that
swarm
and
multiply
With
infinite
complacency,
men
went
to
and
fro
about
the
globe.
Confident
of
our
empire
over
this
world.
Yet,
across
the
gulf
of
space,
intellects
vast
and
cool
regarded
our
planet
with
envious
eyes,
and
slowly
and
surely
drew
their
plans
against
us.
Ray!
I
need
you
back
at
4
instead
of
12.
No,
I
can't.
Call
Fedesco.
Fedesco
can't
move
40
containers
I
gotta
have
somebody
Sorry,
I
can't
help
you,
Sal.
Com'on,
I'm
in
a
position
here.
Remember
the
union
regulation,
Sal.
You
know
what
your
problem
is?
I
can
think
of
a
couple
of
women
8:30?
We
said
8:00.
This
is
one
safe
looking
new
vehicle
Congratulations.
8:00,
huh?
We'll
be
back
by
9:30
on
Sunday,
Here
he
is.
Get
a
hug?
Handshake?
Kicking
the
teeth?
The
door
is
locked.
Still
got
those
manners?
Hello,
dad.
Hello,
Rachel!
Here,
honey.
The
door
is
locked.
Sweetheart,
let
me
get
it.
-
Hey,
she
said
she
can
get
it.
-
It's
heavy.
-
Just
roll
it.
I've
got
it
from
here,
OK?
302
V8,
it's
er...
it's
gonna
be
out
here
next
week.
You'd
better
get
go
and
you
won't
be
You're
out
of
milk.
And
everything
else.
You
close
the
door,
please?
I'm
gonna...
wait
outside.
You're
OK,
sweetheart.
Bye,
Tim.
-
I'd
better
get
this
upstairs.
A
little
old
to
still
be
sharing,
-
I
don't
hear
any
complaint.
Robbie
has
got
a
paper
which
is
yet
to
begin.
It
would
be
nice
if
you
were
done
so
we
don't
have
to
keep
him
up
I've
just
got
to
type
it
up.
-
No,
you
just
gotta
start
writing
it
first.
I
love
you.
Listen
to
your
father.
Oh,
no
shoes
on
bed.
We'll
be
at
my
parents'
house
in
Boston
but
don't
call
the
house
line.
The
point
is
I've
got
my
cellphone
or
you
have
any
questions,
Believe
it
or
not,
I
can
handle
it.
I'll
leave
the
phone
on.
Mary
Ann...
this
is
good
look
for
you.
You
think?
Yeah.
Take
care
of
our
kids.
You've
got
nothing
to
worry
about.
Listen,
you
tell
your
mom
She'll
love
that.
The
Ukraine,
is
in
almost
blackness
tonight
in
the
wake
of
a
series
of
catastrophic
proportion
which
struck
EMP:
eletroc-magnetic
pulse,
which
causes
a
temporary
interruption
As
in
the
Ukraine,
there
are
was
followed
by
sismic
activity
measuring
6.5
on
the
Richter
Scale.
-
Baseball
season
is
over.
Here
he
is.
Boston.
There
it
is?
That's
how
it
could
be?
-
Careful
with
that
throw.
Mum
says
you
got
a
report
due
on
Monday.
Yeah,
I'm
almost
finished.
That's
bullshit.
Yeah?
What
do
you
know,
Ray?
Everything.
Haven't
you
heard
We
know
everything.
What's
the
capital
of
Australia?
That's
one
my
brother's
knows.
OK
with
you
I
just
laughed
the
first
Just
do
your
report...
We
don't
send
you
to
school
You
don't
pay
for
it.
That's
half
what
I
got.
You're
an
asshole.
I
hate
coming
here.
Why
you
act
like
such
a
dick?
What?
That's
not
how
you
gonna
get
-
If
you
want
him
to
listen
to
you...
A
mother?
Where
are
you
going?
Go
to
sleep.
I
work
for
a
living.
-
What
are
we
supposed
to
eat?
What's
the
matter?
I've
got
a
splinter.
Where
did
you
get
it?
On
the
porch
railing.
You
need
me
there.
You
did
what?
-
You
want
me
to
take
that
out?
Come
here,
let
me
see
that.
Dad!
Just
look.
I
can't,
you're
moving
around.
OK,
but
don't
touch
it.
It's
gonna
get
infected.
-
No,
it
won't.
No,
it
won't.
When
it's
ready,
-
Push
it
out?
You
should
get
TiVo.
Tim
got
it
for
my
room.
To
watch
all
my
shows
after
homework.
I'll
just
put
on
my
platinum
card.
Robbie!
What
is
that?
Hummus.
Hummus?
From
the
health
food
place.
I
kept
one
of
their
menus
You
said
to
order!
I
meant
order
food.
Where
is
Robbie?
-
He
went
out.
I
don't
know.
You
ever
see
something
like
that?
Springtime
maybe,
Com'on.
-
That
is
so
weird.
The
wind
is
blowing
towards
the
storm.
That
is
weird.
Rachel,
wanna
see
some
cool?
It's
OK.
I
wanna
go
inside.
I
wanna
go
inside!
OK,
you
go
ahead.
That's
enough
lightnings
for
me.
I
won't
go
by
myself.
It's
kinda
fun,
innit?
Com'on,
like
the
4th
of
July.
No,
it's
not.
It's
OK.
You're
fine.
-

It
hit
right
behind
our
house.
Because
lightning
doesn't
strike
twice
Shit!
Where
is
Robbie?
I
don't
know.
Is
Robbie
OK?
Are
you
OK?
Where
is
the
thunder?
I
want
it
stop.
Is
it
over?
Where
you
going?
Just
checking
things
out.
Are
we
gonna
be
OK?
I
don't
know.
-
You
don't
know?
Stop
asking
so
many
questions.
You
believe
this,
Ray?
Jesus,
Jesus.
-
The
car
just
stopped
and...
-
Lightnings
hit
our
walkway
over
and
over.
-
Where
the
hell
did
you
go?
-
You
saw
the
lightning?
The
lightning
started
to
hit
and
open
up
26
times?
OK.
-
You're
OK?
Your
sister
is
in
the
house.
And
next
time
you
take
my
car
I
call
the
cops.
You'd
better
be
there
when
I
get
back!
Manny!
-
What
is
it?
Dead?
-
Starter's
fried.
Not
even
close.
I
thought
if
I
changed
it...
I'm
on
my
way
to
find
out.
Right...
I
told
you
that.
-
Let
us
through.
I'm
sure
you
know
who
is
bedhind
this.
God's
pissed
off
-
You
see
it?
-
You've
got
power?
-
It's
the
cars
though,
you
know.
Solar
flare?
Yeah,
he
says
the
sun
resorts
big
blast
Can
I
say
something...
It's
the
only
thing
Can
I
say
something?
-
I
told
you
what
the
guy
said
he
heard.
I've
never
seen
That
many
lightnings
on
one
spot.
-
Is
this
the
only
place?
We're
gonna
fall
in.
Is
it
hot?
No,
it's
freezing.
-
You
feel
that?
-
Yeah.
There
is
no
subway
here.
A
train
maybe?
That
can't
be
the
water
main.
There's
nothing
that
stand
there.
The
water
main
doesn't
run
through
here.
Well,
there's
something
down
there
Step
back!
Everyone
back
up,
What's
that?
Oh
my
God!
Ray,
no,
stay
in
back.
What
happened?
What's
going
on?
Dad,
what's
the
matter?
What's
all
that
stuff
all
over
you?
What's
all
that
stuff?
We
live
this
house
in
60
seconds.
-
Why?
I've
no
idea
of
what's
going
on.
Just
do
it.
-
Rachel!
I
need
you
to
get
a
suitcase.
Can
you
just
do
that
for
me?
What's
happening?
I
can't
tell
you
now.
Please...
Keep
down.
Ray,
I'm
standing
right
beside
you,
Get
the
front
seat,
Robbie.
Whose
car
is
this?
Whose
car
is
this!
Hey,
you
were
absolutely
right,
Com'on,
open
up.
Open
the
door!
-
Get
in,
Manny.
-
It's
not
yours.
Get
in,
Manny.
-
I
don't
have
time
to
explain.
Get
in,
Manny,
and
you're
gonna
die.
What
do
you
mean?
Get
out
of
the
truck.
-
I'm
not
fooling
around.
I
got
a
busy
day...
Get
down!
Get
down!
Are
they
the
terrorists?
-
Get
down!
-
Where
are
we
going?
We
got
maybe
the
only
working
car.
Clear
what?
-
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
By
who?
Can
you
keep
her
down?
Shut
up!
I'm
driving,
do
something!
OK,
put
'em
up,
Rach.
This
space
is
yours,
right?
-
You're
safe
in
your
space.
-
Nothing
will
happen
to
you
in
this
space.
I'm
gonna
go
in
the
front
seat.
I'll
be
like
2
feet
away,
OK?
-
Will
you
hold
my
hand?
-
You're
gonna
be
OK?
I
wanna
know
everything
you
know.
This
thing,
this
machine,
and
started
to
torch
on
everything,
What
is
it?
Is
it
terrorists?
This
came
from
some
place
else.
-
Like
Europe?
Dad,
this
machine,
it's
already
here.
Buried.
Maybe...
it
came
down
in
the
lightning
storm.
What
do
you
mean,
"came
down"?
You've
just
said
it
was
buried.
No,
the
machine
I'm
talking
about
what
came
down
in
the
lightning
storm...
what
operates...
The
what?
1.30,
helicopters
or
airplanes.
-
That's
the
what?
-
How
is
she
doing?
-
OK.
What
was
that
thing
you
do
with
her?
Sometimes,
she
gets
claustrophobic.
-
I
want
mum.
Don't
tell
me
about
it,
you
know.
What
I
need
you
to
do
is
I
want
mum!
When
you
start
screaming
like
that...
That's
where
we're
going
right
now.
-
I
want
mum!
Where
you've
that
one.
Robbie,
the
door.
Mum!
Mum!
Mum!
Tim!
They're
gone.
Is
she
dead?
She
is
not
dead.
She
is
just
not
here,
OK?
How
do
you
know?
Because
they're
on
the
way
to
Boston.
I
just
hope
they
just...
They
must
be
up
I'm
gonna
call
her.
How
come
the
lights
are
on
here
Because
there's
nothing
bad
up
there.
We're
safe
here.
Rachel,
this
is
your
area.
Dad,
it's
not
how
it
goes.
OK.
Because
there
is
food.
-
We
have
this
ketchup,
mustard...
This
is
really
good,
Robbie!
I
said
pack
food.
That's
all
there
was
in
your
kitchen.
That's
all
right.
Food.
Er,
bread.
OK.
We're
gonna
have,
er,
let's
get
some
sandwiches.
See
me
deal.
2
for
you,
2
for
Robbie,
2
for
me,
one
for
the
house.
Maybe
after
you've
eaten
some,
5
card
stud,
maybe
a
little
blackjack.
I'm
allergic
to
peanut
butter.
Since
when?
Birth.
You
can
eat
two
bread,
OK?
I'm
not
hungry.
Robbie
and
I
could
eat
With
jelly
on
this
sandwich?
I'm
not
hungry
either.
You're
not
hungry
either?
Everybody
just...
relax,
OK?
That's
why
we're
here
now.
And
in
the
morning,
mum
and
Tim
If
everything's
fine,
We've
got
perfectly
good
beds.
It's
like
a
slumber
party.
What
are
you
afraid
Nice
basement.
I
wanna
sleep
in
my
bed.
I've
got
back
problems.
You
know
the
way
the
channel,
and
they
tell
to
go
-
It's
like
that.
-
Rachel,
no
more
talking.
-
Good
night,
Robbie.
Is
the
lightning
back?
No,
this
is
something
else.
-
What's
that
sound?
What
is
that?
We
gotta
go!
Where
do
we
go?
Are
we
still
alive?
Down
here!
You
were
on
this
plane?
Are
you
a
passenger?
How
you
doin?
Are
you
a
passenger?
He's
deaf!
The
show
went
off
right
beside
him.
The
camera
on
his
soulder
saved
his
life.
You
get
that,
Max?
Your
stupid
camera
Where
were
you?
Out
there
in
the
Pine
Barrens.
We
were
attached
to
a
national
They
moved
on
one
of
those
things
They
got
some
kind
of
shield
We
can't
see
if
everything
before
we
can
get
close
enough
When
they
flash
the
thing,
There's
more
than
one?
You
gotta
be
kidding
me,
right?
We
were
feeding
New
York
Some
patched
over
the
DC,
L.A.,
Chicago,
uplink
to
London.
Even
called
to
try
but
nobody
answers.
It's
the
same
everywhere.
Once
the
tripods
start
to
move,
My
God!
You
ain't
seen
nothing
yet.
I
saw
that
storm.
You
didn't
see
like
this.
Those
machines
come
out
So
that
means
they
must
been
buried
So
who's
driving
the
goddamn
things?
Watch
the
lightning.
Watch
it.
Watch
the
lightning.
What
is
that?
That...
is
them.
They
come
down
in
capsules
right
in
the
You
hear
that?
We
get
the
hell
ouf
of
here.
Get
in,
get
in!
Were
you
on
that
plane?
That's
too
bad.
It
would
have
been
a
great
story.
Look
at
me.
You
keep
your
eyes
only
on
me,
Don't
look
down,
don't
look
around
me.
I'm
taking
you
to
that
car
but
you're
not
going
to,
OK?
You're
doing
good.
Keep
your
eyes
on
me.
We
go
right
to
Boston.
Nice
girl.
Listen,
I
want
you
to
close
Closed?
Robbie,
get
in!
-
Robbie,
get
in!
Get
in.
-
Why
the
hell
aren't
we
on
the
turnpike?
We're
still
on
the
Hudson
to
me.
We'll
find
an
open
bridge
and
take
the
backroads
across
Where
is
everybody?
I
don't
know,
running,
hiding...
With
any
balls,
we
find
Just
let
me
make
the
big
decisions,
OK?
-
Which
mean
never,
Ray?
-
It's
dad,
sir
or
Mr
Ferrier.
That
sounds
a
little
weird
to
me
-
Dad!
I
have
to
go
to
the
bathroom.
Really?
Not
to
fast,
Al'right?
We
got
to
watch
out
for.
And
second,
people
who
might
want
our
car.
-
There's
nobody
around!
Rachel,
it's
good
right
there.
Not
in
front
of
you,
guys!
Just
go
where
I
can
see
you.
Are
you
crazy?
I'm
not
gonna
look.
That's
looking!
Everytime
you
don't
listen
to
me,
I'm
telling
your
mother.
Make
a
list!
I
told
you
to
stay
where
I
can
see
you!
Stop!
Wait!
Stop!
Watch
out,
kid!
Robbie!
You're
dead
if
you're
leaving
You
never
gave
a
shit
before!
You
never
give
a
shit!
OK,
smartass,
what's
your
plan?
You
become
dad,
We
catch
up
these
soldiers,
hook
up
with
We
get
back
at
them!
That's
what
we
do!
Try
one
that
doesn't
involve
You
have
anything
like
that?
-
Why
not
tell
you've
no
idea
where
to
go?
You
wanna
come
up
wise
and
shit?
You
only
chose
Boston
and
so
you
can
dump
us
on
her.
and
then
you
only
have
to
care
That's
exactly
the
way
you
like
it!
Robbie,
where
you
try
to
go?
What
are
your
trying
to
do?
Who's
gonna
take
care
of
me
if
you
go?
This
is
a
test
If
this
had
been
an
actual
emergency,
the
alert
tone.
This
concludes
the
test
I'll
close
my
eyes,
I
don't
have
a
license.
Since
when
does
that
stop
you?
Ray!
Dad!
Don't
stop.
I've
got
it.
I've
got
it.
-
Where
is
everybody
going?
But
we
do,
right?
Yeah,
we
do.
Why
they
do
that?
Why?
Everybody
just
wants
to
ride.
-
Can't
we
get
them
one?
Put
on
your
seat-belt,
Rachel!
I'm
sorry,
I
can't.
Stop
the
car!
20
people
in
there!
Hold
on!
Are
you
OK?
Wait!
Get
out
of
here!
Get
in
the
car!
Rachel,
get
ouf
of
the
car!
Take
it
easy!
Get
off
the
car!
Move!
Where's
my
son?
Robbie!
Put
the
gun
down.
Listen...
Put
down
the
gun.
My
