Thousands
more.
VAN
HELSING:
No.
My
life,
my
job
is
to
vanquish
evil.
I
can
sense
evil.
VAN
HELSING:
This
thing,
man,
evil
may
have
created
it,
But
evil
does
not
rule
it,
-
I
can.
Anna.
Your
family
has
spent
400
years
Maybe
this
poor
creature
Oh,
my
God.
He's
seen
us.
Now
they'll
come
for
him.
Neither
you
nor
I
If
I
can
get
him
to
Rome,
And
then
the
painting
came
alive...
and
the
two
creatures
-
What
does
it
mean?
Listen,
Carl,
whatever
you
do,
I'm
staring
at
him.
Is
that
a
man?
VAN
HELSING:
Actually,
seven
men.
By
exposing
me,
Me
and
all
of
humanity!
Nothing
is
faster
Not
even
a
werewolf.
Anything
else,
you're
on
your
own.
-
Let
me
go.
I
don't
know
but
you
kind
of
stick
out
We
must
not
let
the
creature
Save
him!
Save
the
monster!
VERONA:
Stakes!
No!
CARL:
Oh,
my
God.
What
are
you
doing
out
here?
Right.
Don't
let
go!
I
can
help!
You
won't
kill
me?
Only
if
you
don't
hurry!
Jump!
Velkan.
Velkan.
Anna...
forgive
me.
I
will
see
you
again.
ANNA:
You
killed
him.
Now
you
know
Oh,
my
God.
You've
been
bitten.
Anna!
Anna.
So
much
trouble
to
my
master.
What
do
you
want?
ALEERA:
The
master
commands
a
trade.
The
monster
for
the
Princess.
Somewhere
public.
Lots
of
people.
A
place
where
your
master
to
expose
his
other
side.
Tomorrow
night
is
All
Hallows'
Eve.
Here
in
Budapest
there
is
-
Are
you
all
right?
He
has
been
bitten.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Bitten
by
a
werewolf.
Now
you
will
become
that
which
I
am
sorry.
May
others
be
as
passionate
VAN
HELSING:
Well,
I'm
sure
this
is
some
sort
of
sin.
VAN
HELSING:
God
will
forgive
us.
You
don't
think
VAN
HELSING:
Carl,
help
me!
CARL:
How
many
commandments
CARL:
Anyway,
according
to
the
book...
you
won't
turn
into
a
werewolf
until
CARL:
That's
two
nights
from
now.
CARL:
You'll
still
be
able
until
the
final
stroke
of
midnight.
VAN
HELSING:
So
I
have
nothing
CARL:
My
God,
you
should
be
terrified.
VAN
HELSING:
Thanks.
CARL:
We
still
have
48
hours
You
sure
he
can't
get
out
of
there?
VAN
HELSING:
Not
without
How
does
it
feel
I
won't
let
you
trade
me,
Count.
I
have
no
intention
of
trading
you.
DRACULA:
And
if
I
know
Van
Helsing,
he
is
not
planning
on
Neither
of
us
There
they
are.
You
make
my
skin
crawl.
This
is
not
all
I
could
do
Carl,
I
need
you
to
do
something.
I'm
not
gonna
like
this,
am
I?
DRACULA:
Don't
we
make
a
lovely
couple?
Oh,
my
God.
DRACULA:
I
am
looking
Someone
strong
and
beautiful.
One
brief
moment
of
pain...
and
we
can
be
together
forever.
You
have
no
heartbeat.
DRACULA:
Perhaps
it
just
needs...
to
be
rekindled.
Anna.
Anna!
VAN
HELSING:
Wake
up.
DRACULA:
Gabriel.
Oh,
Gabriel.
Welcome
to
my
summer
palace.
Master!
Look,
master!
We
have
him,
master.
We
have
him!
You
wretched
undead...
I
shall
have
my
revenge!
"Though
I
walk
through
the
valley
"I
shall
fear
no
evil."
You
are
nothing
but
damned
bones...
and
damned
souls...
and
will
burn
in
the
flames
of
Hell!
Now
that
everything
ladies
and
gentlemen,
Van
Helsing!
Come
on.
Yes!
Now
I
know
what
it's
for.
-
Where
are
we
going?
Carl,
you're
a
genius!
A
genius
with
access
Say
goodbye
to
your
friends.
I'll
find
you!
I
swear
to
God!
-
I
must
save
him.
Why?
I
cabled
Rome
earlier
What
did
they
say?
CARL:
Even
if
you
kill
Dracula...
Rome
orders
you
to
destroy
He
isn't
evil.
But
they
say
he
isn't
human,
either.
Do
they
know
him?
Have
they
spoken
They
want
you
to
destroy
him
so
he
What
of
me?
Did
you
tell
them
VAN
HELSING:
Did
they
tell
you
The
correct
angle
of
the
stake
The
exact
measure
of
silver
ANNA:
Stop!
I'm
sorry.
It's
starting.
They
must
have
taken
Wherever
that
is.
Look,
there's
still
time.
Dracula
can't
bring
his
children
The
sun
sets
in
two
hours.
We've
been
looking
for
him
Yes,
well,
I
wasn't
around
VAN
HELSING:
Okay,
Carl,
That
Count
Dracula
was
actually
The
son
of
your
ancestor.
Everybody
knows
that.
What
else?
All
right.
it
all
started
VAN
HELSING:
Do
you
know
CARL:
No,
there's
just
some
vague
reference
And
in
1462,
when
Dracula
died...
-
he
made
a
covenant
with
the
Devil.
But
the
only
way
he
could
sustain
Excuse
me.
Are
you
going
to
BOTH:
Sorry.
And
your
ancestor,
went
to
Rome
to
seek
forgiveness.
He
was
to
kill
Dracula...
in
return
for
eternal
salvation
right
down
the
line
ANNA:
But
he
couldn't
do
it.
As
evil
as
Dracula
was,
my
ancestor
So
he
banished
him
sending
him
through
a
door
-
And
then
the
Devil
gave
him
wings.
-
All
right,
so
where
is
this
door?
But
when
your
ancestor
couldn't
So
that
future
generations
That
must
be
what
my
father
Clues
to
the
door's
location.
The
door.
Of
course.
You
said
your
father
spent
hours...
staring
at
this
painting,
I
think
you
were
right.
I
think
this
is
the
door.
Look.
A
Latin
inscription.
CARL:
Maybe
it
works
If
this
were
a
door,
my
father
I
can't
finish
the
inscription.
-
Your
father
didn't
have
this.
VAN
HELSING:
Carl,
finish
it.
In
the
name
of
God,
open
this
door.
A
mirror.
Dracula
has
no
reflection
But
why?
Maybe,
to
Dracula
It's
cold.
And
it's
snowing.
VAN
HELSING:
See
you
on
the
other
side.
Be
careful.
Castle
Dracula.
CARL:
Do
we
have
a
plan?
CARL:
Doesn't
have
to
be
but
some
sort
of
plan
would
be
nice.
VAN
HELSING:
We're
going
to
stop
Dracula.
ANNA:
And
kill
anything
CARL:
Well,
you
let
me
know
how
that
goes.
Well,
as
grateful
as
I
am
that
doesn't
seem
like
a
good
thing.
We'd
better
get
moving.
CARL:
So
are
all
of
those...
-
And
inside
them
are...
Igor
do
this!
Lgor
do
that!
How
did
you
find...
-
Please
don't
kill
me!
Well,
I...
My
master
has
awakened.
-
There
is
a
cure.
Dracula.
He
has
a
cure
to
remove
Go,
find
the
cure!
Save
yourself!
ANNA:
Come
on.
You
heard
him.
Wait.
Why
does
Dracula
have
a
cure?
-
I
don't
care!
Why
does
he
need
one?
Why?
Because
the
only
thing
The
painting.
That's
what
it
meant.
ANNA:
Dracula's
been
using
werewolves
Yes,
but
if
one
ever
had
the
will
to
remove
the
curse
and
You're
going
to
take
these
two...
-
and
lead
them
to
the
antidote.
Yes,
I
am.
Here's
the
plan.
When
the
bell
you'll
be
able
to
kill
Dracula.
We
just
need
to
find
the
cure...
and
get
it
into
you
Are
you
insane?
If
they
even
suspect
you
clip
off
one
of
his
fingers.
-
I'll
clip
off
something.
-
that's
where
it
is.
-
Give
me
that!
we
reassembled
the
laboratory.
Not
if
you
wanted
to
live.
Now,
if
I'm
not
cured
by
-
I
don't
think
I
could.
Come
on.
I
don't
like
this
plan.
We
don't
have
a
choice.
You
still
don't
understand.
It
doesn't
matter
We
must
save
my
family.
If
you're
late,
run
like
hell.
Don't
be
late.
Now
go.
Go.
FRANKENSTEIN:
Get
off
me,
What
are
you
complaining
about?
To
prove
that
God
is
not
And
now
you
must
give
that
life
Up!
There
it
is.
I'll
go
first.
Carl!
Stay
as
long
as
you
like.
You
try
to
get
lgor.
Igor
get
you!
-
Go
ahead.
Grab
it.
If
there's
one
thing
I've
learned...
it's
never
to
be
the
first
to
stick
-
Did
I
scare
you?
Then
maybe
I
need
Viscous
material!
Get
it!
Hot.
-
Come
on!
We've
got
to
get
the
antidote
You
can't
go
until
I
say
you
can
go!
Keep
running,
Carl!
And
I'll
say
you
can
go
CARL:
Oh,
my
God!
What
are
you
doing?
-
My
friends
are
doing
it
for
me.
Yes.
You
want
one?
I
can't
unscrew
the
bolts.
I
am
accustomed
to
pain.
It
lets
you
know
you're
alive.
Give
me
life!
One
more
bolt
VAN
HELSING:
You're
almost
out,
my
friend!
Help
me!
But
you're
supposed
to
die.
I
want
to
live.
All
right!
Be
happy
in
the
knowledge...
that
I
shall
weep
Hang
on!
I'll
swing
you
loose!
You
are
too
late,
my
friend.
My
children

Then
the
only
way
to
kill
them
Correct.
So
be
it.
One.
No,
this
cannot
be.
We
are

we
need
not

ourselves
Go!
Go
and

Van
Helsing!
Now!
Thank
you.
Oh,
my
God!
Hurry!
ANNA:
Throw
it
to
me,
Carl!
Yes!
You
are
being
used,
Gabriel,
But
I
escaped.
So
can
you.
ALEERA:
Anna,
my
love...
it
is
your

What
do
you
think
of
that?
I
think
if
you're
going
to
Don't
stand
there
talking
about
it.
Don't
you
understand?
We
could
be
friends.
Partners!
Brothers-in-arms!
Did
I
mention
that
it
was
you
It
must
be
such
a
burden.
to
be
the
Left
Hand
of
God.
All
I
want
is
life,
Gabriel.
The
continuation
of
my
kind.
And
perhaps
the
return
of
my
ring.
Don't
be
afraid,
Gabriel.
I
shall
give
you
back
your
life,
Some
things
For

God
forgive
me.
