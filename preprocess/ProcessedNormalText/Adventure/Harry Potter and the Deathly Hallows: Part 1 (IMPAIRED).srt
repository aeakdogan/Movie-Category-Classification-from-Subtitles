SCRIMGEOUR:
Our
world
has,
perhaps,
But
I
say
this
to
our
citizenry:
We,
ever
your
servants...
...will
continue
to
defend
your
liberty...
...and
repel
the
forces
Your
Ministry
remains...
...strong.


MRS.
GRANGER:
Coming,
Mom.
VERNON:

I
still
don't
understand

Because,

thousand
Obliviate.

VOLDEMORT:
I
was
beginning
to
worry
Come,
we've
saved
you
a
seat.
You
bring
news,
I
trust?
It
will
happen
Saturday
next,
at
nightfall.
YAXLEY:
Dawlish,
the
Auror,
...will
not
be
moved
The
day
before
he
turns
17.
This
is
a
false
trail.
The
Auror
Office
no
longer
plays
any
part
Those
closest
to
him
believe
Well,
they
got
that
right,
haven't
they?

What
say
you,
Pius?
One
hears
many
things,
my
Lord.
Whether
the
truth
is
among
them
Heh.
Spoken
like
a
true
politician.
You
will,
I
think,
-
Where
will
he
be
taken,
the
boy?
Most
likely
the
home
of
someone
I'm
told
it's
been
given
Once
there,
Ahem.
My
Lord.
I
want
to
kill
the
boy.

Wormtail!
Have
I
not
spoken
to
you
Yes,
my
Lord.
Right
away,
my
Lord.
VOLDEMORT:
As
inspiring
...I
must
be
the
one
to
kill
Harry
Potter.
But
I
face
an
unfortunate
complication.
That
my
wand
and
Potter's
They
are,
in
some
ways,
twins.
We
can
wound,
If
I
am
to
kill
him...
...I
must
do
it
with
another's
wand.
Come,
Mm?
What
about
you,
Lucius?
My
Lord?
"My
Lord?"
I
require
your
wand.
Do
I
detect
elm?
Yes,
my
Lord.
And
the
core?
Dragon.
Ahem.
Dragon
heartstring,
my
Lord.
-
Dragon
heartstring.
VOLDEMORT:
...we
are
joined
tonight
...who,
until
recently,
taught
at
Hogwarts
Her
specialty
was
Muggle
Studies.

It
is
Miss
Burbage's
belief
She
would,
given
her
way...
...have
us
mate
with
them.

To
her,
the
mixture
of
magical
...but
something
to
be
encouraged.
BURBAGE:
Severus,
please.
We're
friends.
VOLDEMORT:

Dinner.



HAGRID:
Hello,
Harry.
Hello.
HAGRID:
You're
looking
fit.
What
say
we
get
undercover
HARRY:

HARRY:
I
thought
you
were
You
are
more
important.
-
Hello,
Harry.
Bill
Weasley.
FRED:
He
was
never
always
this
handsome.
True
enough.
Owe
it
all
to
a
werewolf,
-
Hope
to
repay
the
favor
one
day.
LUPIN:
Just
remember,
Fleur,
My
husband,
the
joker.
By
the
way,
wait
till
you
hear
the
news.
All
right.
We'll
have
time
We've
got
to
get
the
hell
out
of
here.
Potter,
you're
underage,
which
means
What's
the
Trace?
If
you
sneeze,
the
Ministry
will
know
We
have
to
use
those
means
of
transport
Brooms,
Thestrals
and
the
like.
That
way,
if
anyone's
out
there
waiting
...they
won't
know
which
Harry
Potter
The
real
one?
I
believe
you're
familiar
No.
Absolutely
not.
I
told
you
he'd
take
it
well.
No,
if
you
think
I'm
gonna
let
everyone
-
Never
done
that
before,
have
we?
I
mean,
taking
that,
becoming
me.
No.
Well,
none
of
us
really
fancy
it,
mate.
Imagine
if
something
went
wrong,
and
MOODY:
They've
all
agreed
to
take
the
risk.

Technically,
I've
been
coerced.
Mundungus
Fletcher,
Mr.
Potter.
-
Always
been
a
huge
admirer.
All
right,
Granger,
as
discussed.
-
Blimey,
Hermione.
For
those
of
you
who
haven't
taken
It
tastes
like
goblin
piss.
Have
a
lot
of
experiences
with
that,
Just
trying
to
diffuse
the
tension.
Oh.
Ugh.

BOTH:
MOODY:
GEORGE:
Haven't
got
anything
FRED:
MOODY:
Well,
fancy
this,
you're
not
you.
MUNDUNGUS:
You'll
need
to
change
too,
Potter.
FLEUR:
RON:
HERMIONE:
Right,
then.
Well
be
pairing
off.
Mundungus,
stick
tight
to
me.
-
As
for
Harry-
The
real
Harry.
-
Where
the
devil
are
you,
anyway?
MOODY:
I
brought
you
here
16
years
ago
when
Seems
only
right
that
I
should
be
Yes,
it's
all
very
touching.
Let's
go.

MOODY:
Head
for
the
Burrows.
On
the
count
of
three.
Hold
tight,
Harry.
MOODY:
...two...
...three!
DEATH
EATER
1:
Which
one?
He's
on
your
right!
He's
over
there!
DEATH
EATER
3:
Hagrid,
we
have
to
help
the
others!
I
can't
do
that,
Harry.
Mad-Eye's
orders.
Hang
on.
Stupefy!


Hang
on,
Harry.

Hagrid.

HARRY:

VOLDEMORT:



MOLLY:
What
happened?
Where
are
the
others?
Is
no
one
else
back?
HAGRID:
They
were
on
us
right
from
Well,
thank
goodness
HAGRID:
The
Death
Eaters
were
GINNY:
Ron
and
Tonks
Dad
and
Fred
as
well.
LUPIN:
Quick.
Into
the
house.
Oh,
my
boy.
Oh.
Oh.

-
Lupin!
What
creature
sat
in
the
corner...
...the
first
time
Harry
Potter
-
Are
you
mad?
A
Grindylow.

LUPIN:
Voldemort
knew
I
had
to
make
sure

Wait.
The
last
words
Albus
Dumbledore
spoke
"Harry
is
the
best
hope
we
have.
What
gave
you
away?
Hedwig,
I
think.
Thanks.
TONKS:
-
I
wouldnt
be
standing
here
without
him.
Always
the
tone
of
surprise.
We
the
last
back?
FRED:
How
you
feeling,
Georgie?
Saint-like.
Come
again?
Saint-like.
I'm
holy.
I'm
holey,
Fred.
Get
it?
The
whole
wide
world
of
ear-related
humor
That's
pathetic.
Reckon
I'm
still
better-looking
than
you.
Mad-Eye's
dead.
Mundungus
took
one
look
at
Voldemort
MOODY:
DUMBLEDORE:
SLUGHORN:
Seven?
HARRY:
SLUGHORN:
HARRY:
If
you
did
destroy
each
Horcrux...
Trust
me.
VOLDEMORT:

RON:
Nobody
else
is
going
to
die.
Not
for
me.
For
you?
You
think
Mad-Eye
died
for
you?
You
think
George
took
that
curse
You
may
be
the
Chosen
One,
mate,
It's
always
been
bigger
than
that.
-
Come
with
me.
You
mad?
Don't
tell
her
I
said
that.
Besides,
-
We've
still
got
the
wedding-
I'm
sorry.
No
matter
whose
it
is.
They're
our
only
chance
to
beat
him...
...and
the
longer
we
stay
here,
Tonight's
not
the
night,
mate.
We'd
only
be
doing
him
a
favor.


Do
you
think
he
knows?
I
mean,
they're
bits
of
his
soul,
When
Dumbledore
destroyed
the
ring,
...he
must
have
felt
something.
To
kill
the
other
Horcruxes,
Where
are
they?
Where
do
we
start?
FRED:

ARTHUR:
Please
pay
attention!
GINNY:
It
seems
silly,
doesn't
it,
a
wedding?
Given
everything
that's
going
on.
Maybe
that's
the
best
reason
to
have
it...
...because
of
everything
that's
going
on.
GEORGE:
ARTHUR:
All
together
now.
One,
two,
three.
How's
it
looking
at
your
end,
boys?
FRED
&
GEORGE:
Bloody
hell.
To
what
do
we
owe
the
pleasure,
I
think
we
both
know
the
answer
And
this
is...?
SCRIMGEOUR:
"Herein
is
set
forth
...of
Albus
Percival
Wulfric
First,
to
Ronald
Bilius
Weasley...
...I
leave
my
Deluminator...
...a

my
own
making...
...in
the
hope
that,
...it
will
show
him
the

"
-

left
this
for
me?
Brillliant.
What
is
it?
Wicked.
"To

No?
"To

...I
leave
the

a

...and

"
-
Is
that
it,
then?
Dumbledore
left
you
a
second
bequest:
The
sword
of
Godric
Gryffindor.
Unfortunately,
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
As
an
important
historical
artifact,
HERMIONE:
It
belongs
to
Harry.
It
came
to
him
when
he
needed
it
The
sword
may
present
itself
That
does
not
make
it
And,
in
any
event,

current
HARRY:
Excuse
me?
I
don't
know
what
you're
up
to,
...but
you
can't
fight
this
war
He's
too
strong.

LUNA:
I've
interrupted
a
deep
thought,
haven't
I?
Of
course
not.
How
are
you,
Luna?
Very
well.
Got
bitten
by
a
garden
gnome
Gnome
saliva
is
very
beneficial.
Xenophilius
Lovegood.
Pleasure
to
meet
you,
sir.
I
trust
you
know,
Mr.
Potter,
...unlike
those
toadies
...fully
supported
Dumbledore
...and,
in
his
death,
Thank
you.
Come,
Daddy.
He's
just
too
polite
to
say
so.
XENOPHILIUS:
Excuse
me,
sir?
May
I
sit
down?
Mr.
Potter.
By
all
means.
Here.
HARRY:
I
found
what
you
wrote
You
obviously
knew
Dumbledore
well.
Well,
I
certainly
knew
him
the
longest.
That
is,
if
you
don't
count
his
brother,
...and
somehow,
people
never
do
-
I
didn't
even
know
he
had
a
brother.
Well,
Dumbledore
was
always
Don't
despair,
Elphias.
I'm
told
he's
been
thoroughly
...in
800
pages,
no
less.
Word
has
it
that
someone
talked
to
her.
Someone
who
knew
Both
you
and
I
know
who
that
is,
A
monstrous
betrayal.
Who
are
we
talking
about?
Bathilda
Bagshot.
-
Who?
...she's
only
the
most
celebrated
She
was
as
close
Oh,
I'm
sure
Rita
Skeeter
thought
...to
take
a
peek
Godric's
Hollow?
Bathilda
Bagshot
Well,
that's
where
You
don't
mean
to
say
The
family
moved
there
Oh,
it
was
quite
the
scandal.
Honestly,
my
boy,

SHACKLEBOLT:
The
Minister
of
Magic
is
dead.

They
are
coming.
They
are
coming.
WOMAN
1:
Nice
meeting
you,
Mr.
Potter.

HARRY:
Ginny!
Go!

Here
you
go,
sightseeing
tour?
-
Where
are
we?
I
used
to
come
to
the
theater
here
I
don't
know
why
I
thought
of
it.
This
way.
HERMIONE:
RON:
Undetectable

You're
amazing,
you
are.
Always
the
tone
of
surprise.

Ah.
That'll
be
the
books.
What
about
all
the
people
-
Do
you
think
we
should
go
back?
We'd
put
everyone
in
danger
[MUFFLED
MUSIC
-
Ron's
right.
Coffee?
HERMIONE:
A
cappuccino,
please.
-
What
she
said.
So
where
do
we
go
from
here?
It's
too
dangerous.
If
Voldemort
has
taken
over
the
Ministry,
Everyone
from
the
wedding
My

with
all
my

You're
joking.

I've
had
all

Stupefy!

DOLOHOV:

Go.
Leave.
HARRY:

This
one's

is
Rowle.
He
was
on
the
Astronomy

This
is
Dolohov.
I
recognize
him
So,
what
we
gonna
do
with
you,
hey?
Kill
us
if
it
was
turned
round,
HARRY:
HERMIONE:
Suppose
he
did
Mad-Eye.
It's
better
we
wipe
their
memories.
You're
the
boss.
Hermione...
...you're
the
best

Obliviate.
HARRY:
HERMIONE:
Can't
be.

at
17.

What?
We
didn't
celebrate
your
birthday,
Harry.
Ginny
and
I,
we
prepared
a
cake.
We
were
going
to
bring
it
out

appreciate
the
thought,
but
given
the
fact
...by

Eaters

We
need
to
get
off

What
was
that
all
about?
Probably
Mad-Eye's
idea,

Homenum

We're
alone.
OLLIVANDER:
VOLDEMORT:
You
lied
to
me.

I
believed
a
different

Yes,

did

KREACHER:
Blood

Yes.
It
was
here
in
this

A
most
evil

How
do
you
mean?
Before
Master
Regulus
died,
...but
no
matter
how
hard
Kreacher
tried,
Well,
where
is
it
now?
-
Did
someone
take
it?
He
took
many
things,
Who
did?
Who
was
it,
Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus
Fletcher.
Find
him.

My
father
will
hear
about
this.
NEVILLE:
He
isn't
here.
As
your
new
Minister

...I
promise
to
restore

its
former
glory.
Therefore,
beginning
today...
...each

evaluation.
But

No,

just

achieved

I
thought
Dumbledore
told

I
thought
you
had

In

you
haven't
noticed,
Yeah,
and
we're
as

I
didn't
catch
the
first
Snitch

"I
open

close.

I
don't
know.
I
found
something
as
well.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
an
eye,
It
isn't
a
rune,
and
it
isn't
anywhere
Somebody
inked
it
in.
HARRY:
Luna's
dad
was
wearing
that
Why
would
someone
draw
it
Look,
Hermione,
I've
been
thinking.
I
want
to
go
to
Godric's
Hollow.
It's
where
I
was
born.
That's
exactly
where
he'll
expect
you
to
go
Yeah,
but
it
means
something
to
him
too,
You-Know-Who
almost
died
there.
I
mean,
isn't
that
exactly
the
type
of
place
It's
dangerous,
Harry.

But
even
I
have
to
admit,
recently
I
think
it's
possible
What?
HERMIONE:
If
Dumbledore
wanted
you
to
find
it,
...where
better
to
hide
it
than
Hermione...
Don't
ever
let
me
I
still
think
we
shouldve
used
No.
This
is
where
I
was
born.
I'm
not
returning
as
someone
else.

MAN:
Harry,
I
think
it's
Christmas
Eve.
Listen.

Do
you
think
they'd
be
in
there,
My
mom
and
dad.
Yeah,
I
think
they
would.
HERMIONE:
Hey,
Harry?
Merry
Christmas,
Hermione.
Merry
Christmas,
Harry.

Harry,
there's
someone
I
think
I
know
who
that
is.
HERMIONE:
HARRY
:
Hermione,
she
knew

This
is
where
he
murdered
them.

You're
Bathilda,
aren't
you?
HARRY:
Miss
Bagshot,
who
is
this
man?

HARRY:






HERMIONE
:




Confringo!

Are
you
feeling
better?
You've
outdone
yourself
this
time,
The
Forest
of
Dean.
I
came
here
once
with
Mom
and
Dad,
It's
just
how
I
remember
it.
The
trees,
the
river,
everything.
Like
nothing's
changed.
Not
true,
of
course.
If
I
brought
my
parents
back
here
now,
Not
the
trees,
not
the
river...
...not
even
me.
Maybe
we
should
just
stay
here,
Harry.
Grow
old.
You
wanted
to
know
I
know.
Gellert
Grindelwald.
HARRY:
He's
the
thief
I
saw
Speaking
of
which,
where
is
my
wand?
Where's
my
wand,
Hermione?
As
we
were
leaving
Godric's
Hollow,
I'm
sorry.
-
I
tried
to
mend
it,
but
wands
are
different.
Leave
me
yours.
I'll
take
the
locket
as
well.
DUMBLEDORE:
HARRY:
Accio
sword.
Diffindo.



HARRY:
Hermione?
It
was
you?
Well,
yeah.
Bit
obvious,
I
think.
And
you
cast
the
doe
as
well,
did
you?
-
No,
I
thought
that
was
you.
Right.
Yeah.
Antlers.
HARRY:
I
can't
handle
it.
That
thing
affects
me
-
All
the
more
reason.
Then
why
are
you
here?
Why
did
you
come
back?
Now,
I'll
have
to
speak
to
it
in
order
for
it
I
don't
know
what's
in
there,
The
bit
of
Riddle
that
was
in
that
diary

All
right.
One...
...two...
...three.



VOLDEMORT:
I
have
seen
your
dreams,
...and
I
have
seen
your
fears.
Least
loved

your
mother,
Least
loved

the

HARRY:
We
were
better
without
you.
Happier
without
you.
Who
could
look
at
you
What
are
you
HARRY:
Your
mother
confessed
What
woman
would
take
you?
You
are
nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing
compared
to
him.



RON:
...only
three
to
go.
HARRY:
Hermione?
Is
everything
all
right?
It's
fine.
Hey.
You
complete
ass,
Ronald
Weasley!
You
show
up
here
after
weeks,
-
Where's
my
wand?
Where's
my
wand?
-
Harry
Potter,
give
me
my
wand.
-
How
come
he's
got
your
wand?
What
is
that?
You
destroyed
it.
And
how
is
it
that
you
just
happen
It's
a
long
story.
-
Don't
think
this
changes
anything.
I
only
just
destroyed
a
bloody
Horcrux.
Look,
I
wanted
to
come
back
-
I
just
didn't
know
how
to
find
you.
With
this.
It
doesn't
just
turn
off
lights.
I
don't
know
how
it
works,
but
Christmas
...keeping
away
from
some
Snatchers...
...and
I
heard
it.
It?
A
voice...
...your
voice,
Hermione...
...coming
out
of
it.
-
And
what
exactly
did
I
say,
may
I
ask?
Just
my
name.
Like
a
whisper.
So
I
took
it,
clicked
it,
And
I
knew.
And
sure
enough,
it
floated
toward
me,
...went
right
to
my
chest,
And
I
knew
it
was
gonna
take
me
...and
came
to
this
hillside.
It
was
dark.
I
had
no
idea
where
I
was.
I
just
hoped
And
you
did.
I've
always
liked
these
flames
How
long
do
you
reckon
Well,
just
keep
talking
about
that
...and
shell
come
round.
It
was
true.
Every
word.
This
is
gonna
sound
crazy...
...but
I
think
that's
why
Dumbledore
I
think
he
knew
that
somehow
I'd
need
it
Bloody
hell,
I
just
realized,
-
Yeah.
It's
a
blackthorn.
Ten
inches.
Nothing
special,
but
I
reckon
itll
do.
Took
if
off
a
Snatcher
Don't
tell
Hermione
this,
This
one
was
definitely
part
troll,
Engorgio.
-
Reducio!
-
Nothing.
We
need
to
talk.
Yeah,
all
right.
-
I
want
to
go
see
Xenophilius
Lovegood.
See
this?
It's
a
letter
Dumbledore
wrote
It's
the
mark
again.
It
keeps
cropping
up.
In
Beedle
the
Bard,
HARRY:
-
Where?
But
what
does
it
mean?
Look,
you've
got
no
idea
where
...but
this,
this
means
something.
-
I'm
sure
of
it.
We
ought
to
see
Lovegood.
Let's
vote
on
it.
Those
in
favor?
You're
not
still
mad
at
him,
are
you?
I'm
always
mad
at
him.
RON:
HERMIONE
&
HARRY:

"Keep
off
the
dirigible
plums.
"
What
is
it?
Who
are
you?
What
do
you
want?
Hello,
Mr.
Lovegood.
I'm
Harry
Potter.
Could
we
come
in?
HERMIONE:
Where
is
Luna?
She'll
be
along.
So
how
can
I
help
you,
Mr.
Potter?
Well,
actually...
It
was
about
something
you
were
wearing
You
mean
this?
Yes.
That
exactly.
What
we've
wondered
is,
what
is
it?
What
is
it?
Well,
it's
the
sign
of
the
Deathly
Hallows,
RON
&
HERMIONE:
The
what?
The
Deathly
Hallows.
I
assume
you're
all
familiar
with
RON
&
HERMIONE:
Yes.
HERMIONE:
"There
were
once
three
brothers...
...who
were
traveling
along
a
lonely,
Midnight.
Mom
always
said
"midnight.
"
But
"twilights"
fine.
Better,
actually.
HERMIONE:
RON:
HERMIONE:
...who
were
traveling
along
a
lonely,
In
time,
the
brothers
reached
a
river
But
being
learned
in
the
magical
arts...
...the
three
brothers
simply
Before
they
could
cross,
however...
...they
found
their
path
blocked
It
was
Death,
and
he
felt
cheated.
Cheated
because
travelers
would
But
Death
was
cunning.
He
pretended
to
congratulate
...and
said
that
each
had
earned
a
prize
for
The
oldest
asked
for
a
wand
So
Death
fashioned
him
one
The
second
brother
decided
he
wanted
...and
asked
for
the
power
So
Death
plucked
a
stone
from
the
river
Finally,
A
humble
man...
...he
asked
for
something
that
would
...without
being
followed
by
Death.
And
so
it
was
that
Death
reluctantly
The
first
brother
traveled
...where,
with
the
Elder
Wand
in
hand...
...he
killed
a
wizard
Drunk
with
the
power
...he
bragged
of
his
invincibility.
But
that
night,
...and
slit
the
brother's
throat
And
so
Death
took
the
first
brother
The
second
brother
journeyed
...where
he
took
the
stone
To
his
delight,
the
girl
he'd
once
hoped
...appeared
before
him.
Yet,
soon
she
turned
sad
and
cold
Driven
mad
with
hopeless
longing...
...the
second
brother
killed
himself
And
so
Death
took
the
second
brother.
As
for
the
third
brother...
...Death
searched
for
many
years
Only
when
he
attained
a
great
age
...shed
the
Cloak
of
Invisibility
He
then
greeted
Death
as
an
old
friend
...departing
this
life
as
equals.

XENOPHILIUS:
So
there
you
are.
I'm
sorry,
sir.

Where's
that
pen
I
had?
The
Eider

The
most
powerful
wand

The
Resurrection

The

Together,
they
make

not
drinking
any
more
of
that
stuff,
Thank
you,
sir.
-
You
forgot
the
water.
For
the
tea.
Did-?
Did
I?

How
silly
of
me.
It's
no
matter.
No,
you
can't!

HARRY:
You're
my
only
hope.
They
were
angry,
you
see,
So
they
took
her.
They
took
my
Luna.
My
Luna.
But
it's
really
you
they
want.
Who
took
her,
sir?
Voldemort.


Stop!
I've
got
him!

That
treacherous
little
bleeder.
They
kidnapped
her
He
was
just
desperate.
I'll
do
the
enchantments.
Hello,
beautiful.
Well,
don't
hang
about,
snatch
them.





VOLDEMORT:
Tell
me,
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
Hello,
Tom.
...but
surely
you
must
know
-
Tell
me,
Grindelwald.
Tell
me
where
it
is.
Tell
me
who
possesses
it.
The
Eider
Wand
lies
with
him,
...buried
in
the
earth.
Dumbledore.

HARRY:
...but
he's
only
after
one
of
them,
He's
gonna
have
it
by
the
end
of
the
night.
-
Don't
touch
her.
Unh!
SCABIOR:
Get
off
me.
...if
he
doesn't
learn
to
behave
himself.

What
happened
to
you,
ugly?
No,
not
you.
-
What's
your
name?
SCABIOR:

And
you,
my
lovely...
...what
do
they
call
you?
Penelope
Clearwater,
half-blood.

There's
no
Vernon
Dudley
on
here.
GREYBACK:
Did
you
hear
that,
ugly?
How
come
you
don't
want
us
The
list's
wrong.
I
told
you
who
I
am.
Change
of
plan.
We're
not
taking
this
lot
to
the
Ministry.
BELLATRIX

BELLATRIX:
DRACO:
I
can't
be
sure.
If
we
are
the
ones
...everything
would
be
forgiven.
Now,
we
won't
be
forgetting
who

You
dare
to
Lucius.

Now,
if
this
isn't
who
we
think
it
is,
Draco,
We
need
to
be
absolutely
sure.
What's
wrong
with
his
face?
BELLATRIX:
SCABIOR:
Something
he
picked
up
in
the
forest,
Or
ran
into
a
Stinging
Jinx.
Give
me
her
wand.
Ah.
Got
you.

What
is
that?
Where'd
you
get
that
from?
It
was
in
her
bag
when
we
searched
her.


SCABIOR:

Go!
Get
out!
Cissy,
put
the
boys
in
the
cellar.
I
want
to
have
a
little
conversation


What
are
we
gonna
do?
GIRL:
Harry?
Luna?
That
sword
is
meant
to
be
in
my
vault
What
else
did
you
and
your
friends
take

I
didn't
take
anything.
Please.
I
don't
believe
it.


We
have
to
do
something.
There's
no
way
out
of
here.
HERMIONE:
Please!
please!
LUNA:
That's
a
curious
thing

Help
us.
-
Let
her
go.
You,
goblin,
come
with
me.

-
Aah!
What
are
you
doing
here?
Dobby
has
come
to
rescue
Dobby
will
always
be
there
You
can
Apparate
in
and
out
of
this
room?
Of
course,
sir.
I'm

elf.
Works
for
me.
Dobby,
I
want
you
to
take
Luna
Shell

Trust
me.
Whenever
you're
ready,
sir.
Sir?
I
like
her
very
much.

Meet
me
at
the
top
of
the
stairs

Ow.
Who
gets
his
wand?
BELLATRIX:
I'm
only
going
to
Think
very,
very
carefully
GRIPHOOK:
You
don't
know?
Who
got
into
my
vault?
Who
stole
it?
Who
stole
it?
Well?
GRIPHOOK:
When
I
was
last
in
your
vault,
BELLATRIX:
Oh,
well
then,
perhaps
GRIPHOOK:
Liar!
Consider
yourself
lucky,
goblin.
The
same
won't
be
said
for
this
one.
Like
hell.
Expellliarmus!
Stupefy.
BELLATRIX:
Drop
your
wands.
I
said,
drop
them!
Pick
them
up,
Draco,
now.
Well,
well,
well,
It's
Harry
Potter.
He's
all
bright
and
shiny
and
new
again,
Call
him.
Call
him.



Stupefy!
BELLATRIX:
-
You
couldve
killed
me.
Dobby
only
meant
to
maim

How
dare
you
take
a
witch's
wand?
How
dare
you
defy
your
masters?
Dobby
has
no
master.
Dobby
is
a
free
elf.
And
Dobby
has
come


Hermione.
You're
all
right.
We're

We're
all
safe.
DOBBY:

Dobby.
No,

Hold
on.
Look,

hold
on,
okay?
Well
fix
you.
Hermione
will
have
something.
In
your
bag.
Hermione?
Hermione?
What
is
it?
Help
me.
Such
a
beautiful
place...
...to
be
with
friends.
Dobby
is
happy
to
be
with
his
friend...
...Harry
Potter.
We
should
close
his
eyes.
Don't
you
think?
There.
Now
he
could
be
sleeping.
I
want
to
bury
him.
Properly.
Without
magic.
