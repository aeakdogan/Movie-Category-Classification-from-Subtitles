SENECA:
I
think
it's
our
tradition.
It
comes
out
of
a
particularly
painful
Yes,
yes.
But
it's
been
the
way
At
first,
it
was
a
reminder
of
the
rebellion.
-
It
was
a
price
the
districts
had
to
pay.
But
I
think
it
has
grown
from
that.
I
think
it's
something

This
is
your
third
year
as
Gamemaker.
What
defines
your
personal
signature?
PRIM:

No!
No!

KATNISS:
It's
okay.
It's
okay.

It
was
me.
I
know.
I
know.
But
it's
not.
It's
your
first
year,
Prim.
They're
not
gonna
pick
you.
Try
to
go
to
sleep.
I
can't.
Just
try.
Just
try.

Deep
in
the
meadow
Under
the
willow

A
bed
of
grass
A
soft
green
pillow
You
remember
that
song?
Okay.
You
finish
it.
I've
got
to
go.
Where?
I've
just
got
to
go.
But
I'll
be
back.
I
love
you



I'll
still
cook
you.
GALE:
What
are
you
gonna
Damn
you,
Gale!
It's
not
funny!
What
are
you
gonna
do
It's
Reaping
Day.
I
was
gonna
sell
it
to
some
Peacekeepers.
Of
course
you
were.
Like
you
don't
sell
to
Peacekeepers.
No.
Not
today.
It
was
the
first
deer
I've
seen
in
a
year.
Okay.


What
if
they
did?
Just
one
year.
-
They
won't,
Gale.
Won't
happen.
You
root
for
your
favorites.
-
It's
sick.
If
no
one
watches,
It's
as
simple
as
that.
-
What?
-
Fine.
Laugh
at
me.
We
could
do
it,
you
know?
Take
off,
live
in
the
woods.
They'd
catch
us.
Well,
maybe
not.
Cut
out
our
tongues,
or
worse.
No,
I'd
get
five
miles.
I'd
go
that
way.
KATNISS:
I
have
Prim,
GALE:
They
can
come,
too.
KATNISS:
Prim
in
the
woods?

Or
maybe
not.
I'm
never
having
kids.
I
might,
if
I
didn't
live
here.
-
But
you
do
live
here.
Oh,
I
forgot.
Here.
Oh,
my
God!
Is
this
real?
Yeah.
Better
be.
Cost
me
a
squirrel.

Happy
Hunger
Games.
"And
may
the
odds
be
ever
in
your
favor."
How
many
times
is
your
name
in
today?
Forty-two.
Guess
the
odds
aren't
exactly
in
my
favor.
-
Thank
you,
girl.
What's
this?
That's
a
Mockingjay.
How
much?
-
You
keep
it.
It's
yours.
Mom.
KATNISS:
Aw,
look
at
you!
You
look
beautiful.
But
you
better
tuck
in
that
tail,
little
duck.
I
laid
something
out
for
you,
too.
Okay.
Now
you
look
beautiful,
too.
Wish
I
looked
like
you.
Oh,
no.
I
wish
I
looked
like
you,
little
duck.

Hey.
You
want
to
see
what
I
got
you
today?
It's
a
Mockingjay
pin.
To
protect
you.
And
as
long
as
you
have
it,
Okay?
I
promise.


Shh.
Shh.
Prim,
it's
okay.
It's
okay.
Shh.
Okay.
It's
time
to
sign
in
now.
Okay?
They're
gonna
prick
your
finger
-
You
didn't
say...
It
doesn't
hurt
much.
Just
a
little.
Okay?
Go
sit
down
there
with
the
little
kids.
WOMAN:
Next.
Next.


Go
ahead.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Next.

It's
okay.
Welcome!
Welcome,
welcome.
Happy
Hunger
Games.
And
may
the
odds
be
ever
in
your
favor.
Now,
before
we
begin,
Brought
to
you
all
the
way
from
The
Capitol.


War.
Terrible
war.
PRESIDENT
SNOW:
War.
Terrible
war.
This
was
the
uprising
that
rocked
our
land.
Thirteen
districts
rebelled
against
loved
them,
protected
them.
Brother
turned
on
brother
And
then
came
the
peace,
A
people
rose
up
from
the
ashes,
But
freedom
has
a
cost.
We
swore
as
a
nation
And
so
it
was
decreed
that
each
year
would
offer
up,
in
tribute,
to
fight
to
the
death
in
a
pageant
of
honor,
The
lone
victor,
bathed
in
riches,
of
our
generosity
and
our
forgiveness.
This
is
how
we
remember
our
past.
-
This
is
how
we
safeguard
our
future.
I
just
love
that!

Now,
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
select
one
courageous
young
man
and
woman
for
the
honor
of
representing
District
12
As
usual,
ladies
first.

Primrose
Everdeen.
Where
are
you,
dear?
Come
on
up.
Well,
come
on
up.
Prim!
Prim!
No.
No!
I
volunteer!
I
volunteer!
I
volunteer
as
Tribute!
I
believe
we
have
a
volunteer,
Mr.
Mayor.
Prim,
you
need
to
get
out
of
here.
-
No!No!
-
Prim,
go
find
Mom
right
now.
I'm
so
sorry.
-
Go
find
Mom.
Prim,
leave!
Go
find
Mom.
-
No!
No!
No!
EFFIE:
A
dramatic
turn
of
events
Yes,
well.
District
12's
very
first
volunteer.
Come
on,
dear.
What's
your
name?
KATNISS:
Katniss
Everdeen.
EFFIE:
Well,
I
bet
my
hat
that
was
your
sister,
Yes.
Let's
have
a
big
hand
for
And
now
for
the
boys.
Peeta
Mellark.
Here
we
are.
Our
Tributes
from
District
12.
Well,
go
on,
you
two,
shake
hands.
Happy
Hunger
Games.
And
may
the
odds
be
ever
in
your
favor.
PEACEKEEPER:
You
have
three
minutes.

It's
okay.
Prim.
Prim.
It's
okay.
Prim.
Listen.
You're
gonna
be
okay.
It
isn't
worth
putting
your
name
in
Listen,
Prim.
Gale
will
bring
you
game.
Just
try
to
win.
Maybe
you
can.
Of
course.
And
maybe
I
can.
I
am
smart,
you
know?
-
And
you
can
hunt.
PRIM:
To
protect
you.
Thank
you.
You
can't
tune
out
again.
-
I
won't.
I
won't
be
there
anymore.
You're
all
she
has.
No
matter
what
you
feel,
you
have
to
Don't
cry.
Don't
cry.
Don't.
Don't.
-
PEACEKEEPER:
It's
time.
-
Prim,
it's
okay.
It's
okay,
Prim.
I
promise,
Prim.

-
I'm
fine.
I
am.
Listen
to
me.
You're
stronger
than
they
are.
-
Get
to
a
bow.
They
will
if
you
show
them
They
just
want
a
good
show.
If
they
don't
have
a
bow,
You
know
how
to
hunt.
Animals.
It's
no
different,
Katniss.
There's
24
of
us,
Gale.
Only
one
comes
out.
Yeah.
And
it's
gonna
be
you.
Okay.
Take
care
of
them,
Gale.
-
PEACEKEEPER:
Let's
go.

You
two
are
in
for
a
treat.
Crystal
chandeliers,
platinum
doorknobs,
We'll
be
at
The
Capitol
Now,
before
you
do
anything
else...

EFFIE:
200
miles
per
hour,
I
think
it's
one
of
the
wonderful
things
about
that
even
though
you're
here
you
get
to
enjoy
all
of
this.
I'm
going
to
find
Haymitch.
Have
you
ever
met
him?
Haymitch?
You
know,
Katniss,
he
is
our
mentor.
Look,
you
know,
but
I
just
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong


Congratulations.
Where's
the
ice?
I
don't
know.

May
I?
Okay,
so...
So
when
do
we
start?
Whoa.
So
eager.
Most
of
you
aren't
in
such
a
hurry.
Yeah.
I
wanna
know
what
the
plan
is.
-
You're
supposed
to
go...
Yeah,
our
mentor.
You're
supposed
to
tell
us
Oh.
Okay.
Um...
Embrace
the
probability
And
know,
in
your
heart,
So
why
are
you
here
then?
The
refreshments.
Okay,
I
think
that's
enough
of
that.

You
made
me
spill
my
drink.
You
know,
I
think
I'll
go
He's
gonna
come
around.
It's
no
use.
I'm
gonna
go
talk
to
him.
CLAUDIUS
ON
TV:
CAESAR:
Of
course,
of
course.
CLAUDIUS:
Yes,
yes,
they
do.
CAESAR:
Do
you
remember
this
year?
One
of
my
favorite
years.
The
use
of
the
rubble
in
the
ruined
city...
CLAUDIUS:
Very
exciting
CAESAR:
And
this
moment
here,
this
moment
is
a
moment
CLAUDIUS:
Yes.
CAESAR:
The
moment
when
a
Tribute

-
You'd
freeze
to
death
first.
That's
a
good
way
to
get
killed.
What's
a
good
way
to
get
killed?
Oh,
joy.
Why
don't
you
join
us?

I
was
just
giving
Like
what?
I
was
just
asking
about
how
to
find
shelter.
Which
would
come
in
handy
if,
How
do
you
find
shelter?

Pass
the
jam.
How
do
you
find
shelter?
Give
me
a
chance
to
wake
up,
sweetheart.
This
mentoring
is
very
taxing
stuff.
Can
you
pass
the
marmalade?

That
is
mahogany!
Look
at
you.
Just
killed
a
placemat.
You
really
want
to
know
how
to
stay
alive?
You
get
people
to
like
you.
Oh.
Not
what
you
were
expecting?
Well,
when
you're
in
the
middle
of
some
water,
a
knife,
or
even
some
matches
can
mean
the
difference
And
those
things
only
come
from
sponsors.
And
to
get
sponsors,
And
right
now,
sweetheart,
There
it
is.
It's
huge!
That's
incredible.

Peeta,
I
love
you.
Come
on.
Come
on.
You
better
keep
this
knife.
CAESAR:
So
now
that
you've
seen
them,
what
do
you
think
about
Are
there
any
surprises
It's
really
hard
to
tell
just
from
a
Reaping,
-but
I
think
this
is
a
very
interesting
mix.
And
whenever
you
have
a
volunteer
that's
something
you
can't
ignore.

KATNISS:
What's
that?
What's
that?
We're
just
saying
we
might
need
before
we
take
you
to
Cinna.

That
was
one
of
the
bravest
things
-
My
name's
Cinna.
I'm
sorry
that
this
happened
to
you,
and
I'm
here
to
help
you
Most
people
just
congratulate
me.
Well,
I
don't
see
the
point
in
that.
So
tonight,
they
have
the
Tribute
Parade.
I'm
gonna
take
you
out
So
you're
here
to
make
me
look
pretty?
I'm
here
to
help
you
make
an
impression.
Now,
usually
they
dress
people
-
Yeah,
we're
always
coalminers.
I
wanna
do
something
Did
they
explain
Yeah,
but
I'm
not
very
good
We'll
see.
I
just
think
somebody
that
brave
shouldn't
be
dressed
up
I
hope
not.
Okay,
this
is
safe.
I
promise.
It's
not
real
fire.
These
suits
are
built
Looks
pretty
real
to
me.
Well,
that's
the
idea.
You
ready?
-
Don't
be
afraid.

Over
100,000
people
craning
And
the
sponsors
get
to
see
the
Tributes
The
importance
of
this
moment
Very
nice.
First
chariot
on
my
count,
in
15,
14,
13...
There
they
are.
There
they
are.
CAESAR:
It's
the
most
exciting
part.
CLAUDIUS:
It
just
gives
you
goose
bumps.
CAESAR:
And
don't
you
love
how
the
stylists,
they
so
clearly
are
able
to
CLAUDIUS:
Right.
Right.
There's
District
4.
-
Fishing.
-
I
like
it.
And
behind
them,
And
then...
What
is
that
in
the
background?

Come
on.
They'll
love
it.

Yeah!
CAESAR:
Now
see
that?
I
love
that.
Two
young
people
"I'm
proud
I
come
from
District
12.
-
Nope.
People
are
sure
gonna
be
paying
attention
And
we're
ready.
President
Snow,
you're
live.
PRESIDENT
SNOW:
Welcome.
Welcome.
Tributes,
we
welcome
you.

We
salute
your
courage
and
your
sacrifice.
And
we
wish
you
Happy
Hunger
Games.
And
may
the
odds
be
ever
in
your
favor.

That
was
amazing.
EFFIE:
We
are
all
So
brave.
Are
you
sure
you
should
be
Fake
flame?
Are
you
sure
you...
Let's
go
upstairs.
EFFIE:
So,
each
of
the
districts
And
because
you're
from
12,
Come
on.
So
this
is
the
living
room.
I
know,
I
know.
Now,
your
rooms
are
right
over
here.
Why
don't
you
go
clean
yourselves
up


ATALA:
In
two
weeks,
23
of
you
will
be
dead.
One
of
you
will
be
alive.
Who
that
is
depends
on
how
well
particularly
to
what
I'm
about
to
say.
First,
no
fighting
with
the
other
Tributes.
You'll
have
plenty
of
time
for
that
There
are
four
compulsory
exercises.
My
advice
is
don't
ignore
the
survival
skills.
Everybody
wants
to
grab
a
sword,
but
most
of
you
will
die
10%
from
infection,
20%
from
dehydration.
Exposure
can
kill
as
easily
as
a
knife.

-
CATO:
Jason,
where's
my
knife,
huh?
-
I
put
my
knife
right
there!
-
Yes,
you
took
my
knife!
-
You
took
my
knife,
you
liar!
-
You
liar!
CATO:
You
little
punk!
He
took
my
knife!
-
Get
off
me!
CATO:
I'll
finish
you
right
now,
kid!
CATO:
Actually,
better
yet,
You're
the
first
one
I
get,

-
ATALA:
Everybody,
back
in
line!
He's
a
Career.
You
know
what
that
is?
-
From
District
1.
They
train
in
a
special
academy
By
that
point,
they're
pretty
lethal.
But
they
don't
receive
any
special
treatment.
In
fact,
they
stay
in
the
exact
And
I
don't
think
they
let
them
have
dessert.
So
how
good
are
they?
Obviously
they're
pretty
good.
Almost.
...they
can
be
arrogant.
And
arrogance
can
be
a
big
problem.
I
hear
you
can
shoot.
I'm
all
right.
No,
she's
better
than
all
right.
He
says
she
hits
them
-
Peeta's
strong.
He
can
throw
a
100-pound
sack
Okay,
well,
I'm
not
gonna
kill
No,
but
you
might
have
if
somebody
comes
after
you
with
a
knife.
I
have
no
chance
of
winning!
It's
true.
Everybody
knows
it.
You
know
what
my
mother
said?
She
said
District
12
But
she
wasn't
talking
about
me.
She
was
talking
about
you.
I'm
not
very
hungry.

I'm
done,
too.



Throw
that
metal
thing
over
there.
What?
No.
Haymitch
said
we're
not
supposed
I
don't
care
what
Haymitch
said.
Those
guys
are
looking
at
you
Throw
it.



KATNISS:
Hi.
Hey.
How
did
you
do
that?
I
used
to
decorate
the
cakes
-
Oh.
See?
-
Wow.
Hey,
I
think
you
have
a
shadow.
Tomorrow,
they'll
bring
you
in
one
by
one
This
is
important,
because
higher
ratings
This
is
the
time
to
show
them
everything.
There'll
be
a
bow.
Make
sure
you
use
it.
Peeta,
you
make
sure
to
show
your
strength.
They'll
start
with
District
1,
I
don't
know
how
else
to
put
this.
ELECTRONIC
VOICE:
Katniss
Everdeen.
Hey,
Katniss?
Shoot
straight.

Katniss
Everdeen.
District
12.

SENECA:
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Hey,
who
ordered
this
pig?
Did
you
get
some
pig
yet?


Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
-
Are
you
crazy?
Mad?
You
realize
that
your
actions
reflect
badly
They
just
want
a
good
show.
It's
fine.
How
about
it's
just
bad
manners,
Cinna!
Well,
finally!
I
hope
you
noticed
Nice
shooting,
sweetheart.

What
did
they
do
when
you
shot
the
apple?
Well,
they
looked
pretty
startled.
Oh,
yeah.

Now,
what
did
you
say?
"Thanks
for..."
-
Thanks
for
your
consideration.
Genius!
Genius.
I
don't
think
we're
gonna
find
this
funny
On
who?
On
her?
On
him?
I
think
they
already
have.
I
would
have
given
anything
to
see
it.
As
you
know,
the
Tributes
were
rated
after
three
days
of
careful
evaluation.
The
Gamekeepers

with
a
score
of
seven.
Now
our
final
district.
From
District
12.
Peeta
Mellark.
A
score
of
eight.

-
CINNA:
Excellent.
CINNA:
Bravo.
-
We
can
work
with
that.
CAESAR:
And
finally,
from
District
12,
Katniss
Everdeen.
With
a
score
of...
Eleven.

-
Katniss!
-
Yes!
Congratulations.
I
thought
they
hated
me.
They
must
have
liked
your
guts.
To
Katniss
Everdeen,
The
Girl
on
Fire!
Goodness.
We
are.
An
11?
She
earned
it.
She
shot
an
arrow
at
your
head.
Well,
at
an
apple.
Near
your
head.
Sit
down.
Seneca,
why
do
you
think
we
have
a
winner?
What
do
you
mean?
I
mean,
why
do
we
have
a
winner?
I
mean,
if
we
just
wanted
to
why
not
round
up
24
of
them
at
random
Be
a
lot
faster.
Hope.
Hope?
Hope.
It
is
the
only
thing
stronger
than
fear.
A
little
hope
is
effective.
A
spark
is
fine,
as
long
as
it's
contained.
So...
So
contain
it.
Right.
EFFIE:
So
she's
staring
at
all
my
jewels
CINNA:
Well,
look
at
all
that
EFFIE:
Frankly,
it
was
rude.
Oh!
Haymitch,
you
should
join
us.
We're
having
some
of
Oh,
lovely.
-
Where's
Peeta?
Now,
listen,
tomorrow's
the
last
day.
And
they
let
us
work
with
our
own
Tributes
so
you
and
I
will
be
going
down
at
9:00.
What
about
him?
He
says
he
wants
to
be
trained
What?
This
kind
of
thing
does
happen
at
this
point.
We
should
have
some
PORTIA:
Oh,
my,
yes.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies
and
gentlemen
Caesar
Flickerman!

Thank
you!
Thank
you!
Welcome,
welcome,
welcome

Now,
in
about
five
minutes,
All
of
the
Tributes
that
you've
heard
about.
Are
you
excited?
Let
me
hear
it!

CINNA:
Amazing.
I
don't
feel
amazing.
Don't
you
know
how
beautiful
you
look?
No.
And
I
don't
know
-
How
do
you
make
people
like
you?
That's
different.
I
wasn't
trying.
Exactly.
Just
be
yourself,
And
just
pretend
Okay.
Let's
see
if
she
does
indeed
shine.
Let's
have
a
warm
round
of
applause
Glimmer,
are
you
prepared?
Yes,
Caesar,
I
am
very
prepared.
I
like
it.
That's
assurance.
-
Don't
you
think?
...I'm
wearing
one
of
our
own
creations.
CAESAR:
A
big
round
of
applause!
Marvel!
Whoo!
Welcome,
Clove.
-
It's
an
honor
representing
my
district.
I'm
prepared.
I'm
vicious.
I'm
ready
to
go.
Cato!
I
find
that
if
I
can
apply
myself
I
will
be
able
to
figure
it
out.
Thank
you.
Lovely
to
see
you.
Good.
So
you
can
climb
trees.
You're
pretty
quick.
And
are
you
a
hunter?
A
gatherer?
From
District
12,
District
12...
You
know
her
as
The
Girl
on
Fire!

Well,
we
know
her

Welcome!
Welcome.
Welcome.
Well,
that
was
quite
an
entrance
What?

CAESAR:
I
think
someone's
a
little
nervous.
I
said
that
was
quite
an
entrance
at
the
Tribute
Parade
the
other
day.
Do
you
want
to
tell
us
about
it?
Well,
I
was
just
hoping
that

When
you
came
out
of
that
chariot,
I
have
to
say,
my
heart
stopped.
Did
any
of
you
experience
this
as
well?
My
heart
stopped.
So
did
mine.
Now,
tell
me
about
the
flames.
Are
they
real?
Yes.

In
fact,
I'm
wearing
them
today.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Is
it
safe?
Yes.
What
do
you
think,
folks?
AUDIENCE:
Yeah!
I
think
that's
a
yes.

Steady.
Steady.
Lovely.
Thank
you.
That
was
really
something.
That
was
something.
Thank
you
for
that.
I
have
one
more
question
for
you.
It's
about
your
sister.
We
were
all
very
moved,
I
think,
when
Did
she
come
and
say
goodbye
to
you?
Yes.
-
She
did.
And
what
did
you
say
to
her
in
the
end?
I
told
her
that
I
would
try
to
win.
That
I
would
try
to
win
for
her.
Of
course
you
did.
And
try
you
will.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
from
District
12,
Katniss
Everdeen,
The
Girl
on
Fire!

You
did
it,
darling.
That
was
incredible.
Thank
you.
Nice
job,
sweetheart.
Thank
you.
Nice
dress,
too.
-
Not
yours.
Peeta,
welcome.
How
are
you
finding
The
Capitol?
It's
different.
Different.
In
what
way?
Give
us
an
example.
Okay.
Well,
the
showers
here
are
weird.
-
The
showers?
We
have
different
showers.
I
have
a
question
for
you,
Caesar.
-
Take
a
whiff?
-
You
see?
-
You
definitely
smell
better
than
I
do.
That
makes
sense.

Very
funny.
So,
Peeta,
tell
me,
is
there
a
special
girl
back
home?
No.
No.
Not
really.
No?
I
don't
believe
it
for
a
second.
Handsome
man
like
you.
Peeta,
tell
me.
Well,
there...
There
is
this
one
girl
But
I
don't
think
she
actually
recognized
me
Well,
I'll
tell
you
what,
Peeta.
You
go
out
there
and
you
win
this
thing,
and
when
you
get
home,
Right,
folks?
-
Thanks,
but
I
don't
think
winning's
And
why
not?
Because
she
came
here
with
me.
Well,
that's
bad
luck.
Yeah,
it
is.
-
And
I
wish
you
all
the
best
of
luck.
Peeta
Mellark.
District
12!
What
the
hell
was
that?
You
don't
talk
to
me,
You
say
you
want
to
train
alone?
HAYMITCH:
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
-
KATNISS:
Let's
start
right
now!
-
He
did
you
a
favor.
He
made
you
look
desirable,
He's
right,
Katniss.
Of
course
I'm
right.
Now,
I
can
sell
the
star-crossed
lovers
We
are
not
star-crossed
lovers.
It's
a
television
show!
And
being
in
love
with
that
boy
which
could
save
your
damn
life.

Okay.
Why
don't
you
get
out
of
here?
Maybe
I
can
deliver
you
both
Manners!
You,
too?
Hey.
Can't
sleep?
No.
Of
course
not.
I'm
sorry
I
went
after
you.
You
know,
I
meant
that
as
a
compliment.
I
know.

Listen
to
them.
Yeah.
I
just
don't
want
them
to
change
me.
How
would
they
change
you?
I
don't
know.
I
just
don't
want
to
be
You
mean
you
won't
kill
anyone?
No.
I
mean,
I'm
sure
I
would,
when
the
time
came,
but
I
just
keep
wishing
that
they
don't
own
me.
If
I'm
gonna
die,
I
want
to
still
be
me.
Does
that
make
any
sense?
Yeah.
I
just
can't
afford
to
think
like
that.
I
have
my
sister.
Yeah,
I
know.

I
guess
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.
See
you
tomorrow.

They'll
put
all
kinds
of
stuff
right
in
front,
There'll
even
be
a
bow
there.
Don't
go
for
it.
Why
not?
It's
a
bloodbath.
That's
not
your
game.
You
turn,
run,
find
high
ground,
Water's
your
new
best
friend.
Don't
step
off
that
pedestal
early
I
won't.
Katniss,
you
can
do
this.
Thanks.
WOMAN:
Give
me
your
arm.
Give
me
your
arm.
-
Give
me
your
arm.
Your
tracker.
GAMEKEEPER:
We're
up.
We're
up!
All
right.
Less
than
a
minute,
people.
There
are
15
out.
They
are
flying.

Here.

Shh.
Thank
you.
ELECTRONIC
VOICE:

seconds.
I'm
not
allowed
to
bet,
Twenty
seconds.

WOMAN

Twenty-five?
Got

WOMAN

He's

now.






Well,
that
makes
13
gone
And
Claudius,

MARVEL:
Wait!
-
How
stupid
can
you
get?
GLIMMER:
"Oh,
no!
That's
actually
a
good
impression.
Hey,
lover
boy!
-
You
sure
she
went
this
way?
CATO:
You
better
be.
Yeah,
that
was
her
snare
GLIMMER:
Are
you
sure
Nah.
He's
our
best
chance
of
finding
her.
-
Sir?
She
is
almost
at
the
edge.
Two
kilometers
away
SENECA:
Let's
turn
her
around.


Cueing
another.
On
my
count.
One,
two...
She's
heading
towards
the
left
flank.
Okay.
Can
you
give
me
a
tree
right
there?
Sure.
Cueing
tree.


She's
almost
there.
Lucia,
get
a
cannon
ready.

There
she
is!
There
she
is!
-
She's
mine!
-
Where
you
gonna
go?
Fish
out
of
the
pond!
-
There
she
is!
CATO:
Here
we
go!
-
Where
you
going,
huh?
CATO:
Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
Where
you
going,
baby?
Three
o'clock.
-
Where
you
going,
Girl
on
Fire?
Miss
Everdeen,
I'm
gonna
get
you!
That's
not
gonna
help
you
up
there,
Katniss.
CLOVE:
Where
are
you
going?
MARVEL:
Go
get
her,
man!
Just
get
her,
Cato!
GLIMMER:
He's
gonna
get
you,
Katniss.
CLOVE:
Right
up
there.
GLIMMER:
Kill
her!
CLOVE:
Go,
Cato.
CLOVE:
She's
right
there.
You
got
this.
Go!
He's
got
this.
-
Kill
her,
Cato!
Just
get
her,
Cato!
-
GLIMMER:
Take
her
down!
CLOVE:
You
got
this,
Cato!
I'm
coming
for
you!
CLOVE:
Come
on,
Cato!

GLIMMER:
I'll
do
it
myself.
Give
me
that
before...
-
Get
her.
Maybe
you
should
throw
the
sword!
PEETA:
Let's
just
wait
her
out.
She's
gotta
come
down
at
some
point.
We'll
just
kill
her
then.
Okay.
Somebody
make
a
fire.
GLIMMER:
Let's
make
camp
over
here!

Boys.


Thank
you.

Psst.
Psst.
Claudius,
I
think
those
are
tracker
jackers
Oh.
-
Those
things
are
very
lethal.
For
those
of
you
who
don't
know,
tracker
jackers
are
genetically
engineered
powerful
hallucinations,





PEETA:
Run.
Run!
Run!
Katniss,
go!
Get
out
of
here!
Go!
Not
only
is
it
lethal,
can
produce
powerful
hallucinations.

Mom,
don't
just
sit
there
and
look
at
me!
PEETA'S
VOICE:
Katniss,
go!
Get
out
of
here!
Go!
KATNISS:
Rue?
It's
okay.
I'm
not
gonna
hurt
you.
You
want
mine,
too?
No,
that's
okay.
Here.
Thanks.
How
long
was
I
asleep?
Couple
of
days.
I
changed
your
leaves
twice.
Thank
you.
So
what
happened
while
I
was
out?
The
girl
from
1
and
the
boy
from
10.
And
the
boy
from
my
district?
Yeah,
he's
okay.
Is
all
of
that
true?
What?
You
and
him?
So
where
are
Cato
and
the
others?
They
got
all
their
supplies
It's
piled
up
in
this
great
big
pyramid.
That
sounds
tempting.
Now,
this
green
stuff
so
as
soon
as
you
light
it,
Light
this
one
last,
RUE:
Right.
And
then
I'll
destroy
their
stuff
We
need
a
signal
Okay.
Like
what?
Here.
Watch
this.


Mockingjays.
That's
great.
Back
home,
You
try.


Okay,
so
if
we
hear
that,
it
means
we're
okay
We're
gonna
be
okay.
Hey,
I'll
see
you
for
supper.
-
Okay.
Guys.
Guys,
look!
Over
here.
Let's
go.
You
stay
guard
and
don't
move
I
want
to
see
if
she's
gonna
figure
out
Yes.
It
seems
they've
reburied
their
mines
around
that
big
pile
of
goodies.
CAESAR:

GUARD:
I
don't
know
what
happened.
-
What
the
hell
happened?
CATO:
Our
stuff!




RUE:
Katniss!
Katniss!
Katniss,
help!
Katniss!
Katniss!
Help!
Katniss!
Katniss!
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
You're
okay.
You're
okay.
You're
fine.
See?
It's
okay.
You're
okay.
You're
okay.
You're
okay.
Did
you
blow
up
the
food?
Every
bit
of
it.
Good.
You
have
to
win.
Can
you
sing?
Okay.

Deep
in
the
meadow
Under
the
willows
A
bed
of
grass
A
soft
green
pillow
Lay
down
your
head
and
close
your
eyes
And
when
they
open,
the
sun...

I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.



HAYMITCH:
Don't
kill
her.
SENECA:
I
hear
these
rumors
out
of
District
11.
What
do
you
want?
You
have
a
lot
of
anger
out
there.
I
know
you
know
how
to
handle
a
mob.
If
you
can't
scare
them,
Such
as?
Young
love.
So
you
like
an
underdog?
Everyone
likes
an
underdog.
I
don't.
Have
you
been
out
there?
10?
11?
12?
Not
personally.
No.
Well,
I
have.
There
are
lots
of
underdogs.
Lots
of
coal,
too.
Grow
crops,
minerals,
things
we
need.
There
are
lots
of
underdogs.
And
I
think
if
you
could
see
them,
you
would
not
root
for
them
either.
I
like
you.
Be
careful.
CLAUDIUS:
Attention,
Tributes.
Attention.
The
regulations
requiring
a
single
victor
From
now
on,
two
victors
may
be
crowned,
if
both
originate
from
the
same
district.
This
will
be
the
only
announcement.
Peeta.

Oh,
my
God!
Peeta!
Peeta!
Hi.
It's
okay.
What
was
it?
A
sword.
It's
bad,
huh?
It's
gonna
be
fine.
Ah!
-
Katniss.
-
Katniss.
I'm
not
gonna
leave
you.
Why
not?
Nobody's
gonna
find
you
in
here.
They
already
found
me.
We'll
just
get
you
some
medicine.
Katniss,
I
don't
get
many
parachutes.
We'll
figure
something
out.
Like
what?
Something.

PEETA:
Medicine?
I'll
do
it.
That's
nice.
You
fed
me
once.
I
think
about
that
all
the
time.
How
I
tossed
you
that
bread.
-
Peeta...
I
should
have
just
gone
out
in
the
rain
and...

You
feel
hot.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
saw
you.
Your
hair
was
in
two
braids
instead
of
one.
And
I
remember
when
you
sang
The
teacher
said,
And
your
hand
shot
straight
up.
Stop.
After
that,
Every
day-
Well,
say
something.
I'm
not
good
at
saying
something.
Then
come
here.
Please.
-
Even
if
I
don't
make
it...
Stop
it.
CLAUDIUS:
Attention,
Tributes.
Attention.
Commencing
at
sunrise,
at
the
Cornucopia.
This
will
be
no
ordinary
occasion.
Each
of
you
needs
something
desperately.
And
we
plan
to
be
generous
hosts.
Your
medicine.
You're
not
going
alone.
Yeah?
You
need
it,
and
you
can't
walk.
Katniss,
you're
not
gonna
risk
You
would
do
it
for
me.
Wouldn't
you?
Why
are
you
doing
this?
Now
there's
no
way
I'm
letting
you
go.
Peeta...
Please.
Stay.
Okay.
I'll
stay.
Oh,
God!


Where's
lover
boy?
Oh,
I
see.
You
were
gonna
help
him,
right?
Well,
that's
sweet.
You
know,
it's
too
bad
That
little
girl?
What
was
her
name
again?
Rue?
Yeah,
well,
we
killed
her.
And
now
we're
gonna
kill
you.
You
kill
her?
-
No!
-
Cato!
Cato!
You
said
her
name!
Just
this
time,
12.
For
Rue.

Peeta,
I
got
it.
I
got
the
medicine.
-
What
happened
to
you?
No,
you're
not.
What
happened?
The
girl
from
2,
she
threw
a
knife.
I'm
okay.
You
shouldn't
have
gone.
You
got
worse.

I'm
sorry.
You
need
some
of
that,
too.
I'm
okay.
That
feels
better.
Okay.
Now
you.
-
I'm
okay.
Come
on.
All
right.
Hi.
Oh.
You're
so
much
better.
Oh,
my
God,
Peeta.
PEETA:
I
hardly
feel
anything.
We
could
go
home.
We
could.
We're
the
only
team
left.
We
could
go
home.
PEETA:
We
know
Thresh
took
off.
Cato's
gonna
be
by
the
Cornucopia.
He's
not
gonna
go
someplace
Foxface,
she
could
be
anywhere.
We
should
probably
hunt
around
here.
Okay,
I'll
take
the
bow.
I'm
just
kidding.
I'll
go
pick
some
stuff.

Peeta?
Peeta?
Peeta!
Peeta!
Are
you
okay?
-
I
heard
the
cannon.
I
thought...
That's
Nightlock,
Peeta!
I
didn't
know.
You
scared
me
to
death.
Damn
you.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
PEETA:
I
never
even
knew
KATNISS:
She's
clever.
Too
clever.
-
What
are
you
doing?
PEETA:
What
time
is
it?
KATNISS:
A
little
after
noon.
PEETA:
Why
is
it
getting
so
dark?
Must
be
in
a
hurry
to
end
it.
-
You
ready,
Lucia?
Well,
that's
great.
-
Now
can
you
put
that
in
the
middle?
That's
it.
That's
excellent.

Did
you
hear
that?


What
was
that?
It's
the
finale.

Let's
go.


PEETA:
Go.
Katniss!
Here!

Go
on.
Shoot.
Then
we
both
go
down
and
you'd
win.
Go
on.
I'm
dead
anyway.
I
always
was,
right?
I
didn't
know
that
till
now.
How
is
that?
Is
that
what
they
want?
Huh?
-
PEETA:
No.
I
could
still
do
this.
I
could
still
do
this.
One
more
kill.
It's
the
only
thing
I
know
how
to
do.
Bring
pride
to
my
district.
Not
that
it
matters.


CATO:
Please!
No!
Please!


CLAUDIUS:
Attention.
Attention,
Tributes.
There
has
been
a
slight
rule
change.
The
previous
revision,
allowing
for
two
victors
has
been
revoked.
Only
one
victor
may
be
crowned.
Good
luck.
And
may
the
odds
be
ever
in
your
favor.
Go
ahead.
One
of
us
should
go
home.
One
of
us
has
to
die.
No.
They
don't.
Why
should
they?
-
PEETA:
No!
Trust
me.
Together?
Together.
Okay.
One...
Two...
Three.
CLAUDIUS:
Stop!
Stop!
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
of
the
74th
Annual
Hunger
Games.
HAYMITCH:
They're
not
happy
with
you.
KATNISS:
Why?
Because
I
didn't
die?
Because
you
showed
them
up.
Well,
I'm
sorry
-
I'm
not
very
happy
with
them
either.
This
is
serious.
Not
just
for
you.
They
don't
take
these
things
lightly.

When
they
ask,
You
were
so
in
love
with
this
boy
that
the
thought
of
not
being
with
him
You'd
rather
die
than
not
be
with
him.
How
did
you
feel
I
felt
like
the
happiest
person
in
the
world.
I
couldn't
imagine
life
without
him.
Oh.
And
what
about
you,
Peeta?
She
saved
my
life.
We
saved
each
other.
CAESAR:
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
year's
victors

PRESIDENT
SNOW:
Congratulations.
Thank
you.
What
a
lovely
pin.
Thank
you.
It's
from
my
district.
They
must
be
very
proud
of
you.
So
what
happens
when
we
get
back?
I
don't
know.
I
guess
we
try
to
forget.
I
don't
want
to
forget.
