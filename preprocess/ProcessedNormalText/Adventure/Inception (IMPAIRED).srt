ATTENDANT
:
Are
you
here
to
kill
me?
I
know
what
this
is.
I've
seen
one
before.
It
belonged
to
a
man
I
met
A
man
possessed
What
is
the
most
resilient
parasite?
A
bacteria?
A
virus?
An
intestinal
worm?
Uh...
What
Mr.
Cobb
is
trying
to
say-
An
idea.
Resilient.
Highly
contagious.
Once
an
idea
has
taken
hold
of
the
brain,
An
idea
that
is
fully
formed,
Right
in
there
somewhere.
For
someone
like
you
to
steal?
Yes.
In
the
dream
state,
...and
that
makes
your
thoughts
It's
called
extraction.
Mr.
Saito,
we
can
train
...from
even
the
most
skilled
extractor.
How
can
you
do
that?
Because
I
am
the
most
skilled
extractor.
I
know
how
to
search
your
mind
And
I
can
teach
them
to
you,
...your
defense
is
never
down.
Look,
if
you
want
my
help,
you're
gonna
I
need
to
know
my
way
around
...better
than
your
therapist,
If
this
is
a
dream,
...I
need
to
know
what's
in
that
safe.
In
order
for
this
all
to
work,
Enjoy
your
evening,
gentlemen,
He
knows.

What's
going
on
up
there?




Saito
knows.
He's
playing
with
us.
Doesn't
matter.
I
can
get
it
here.
The
information
is
in
the
safe.
He
looked
right
at
it
What's
she
doing
here?
Just
head
back
to
the
room.
Okay,
make
sure
you
do.
If
I
jumped,
would
I
survive?
With
a
clean
dive,
perhaps.
Mal,
what
are
you
doing
here?
I
thought
you
might
be
missing
me.
You
know
that
I
am.
But
I
can't
trust
you
anymore.
So
what?
Looks
like
Arthur's
taste.
Actually,
the
subject
is
partial
Please,
have
a
seat.
Tell
me...
...do
the
children
miss
me?
You
can't
imagine.
What
are
you
doing?
Just
getting
some
fresh
air.
Stay
where
you
are,
Mal.

Goddamn
it.



[SILENCED
GUNSHOT
Turn
around.
The
gun,
Dom.
Please.
Now
the
envelope,
Mr.
Cobb.
Did
she
tell
you?
That
you're
here
to
steal
from
me,
I
want
to
know
the
name
Ah,
there's
no
use
threatening
him
That
depends
Killing
him
would
just
wake
him
up.
But
pain...

Pain
is
in
the
mind.
And
judging
by
the
decor,

-
What
are
you
doing?
It's
too
soon.
I'm
gonna
try
to
keep
Saito
under

He
was
close.
Very
close.


Stop
him!




This
isn't
gonna
work.
Wake
him
up.

He
won't
wake.
-
Give
him
the
kick.
Dunk
him.



He's
out.

You
came
prepared,
hmm?
Not
even
my
head
of
security
knows
It's
difficult
for
a
man
of
your
position
...particularly
where
there's
-
She
would
never...
-
With
a
dilemma.
-
You
got
what
you
came
for.
You
left
out
a
key
piece
of
information,
You
held
something
back
-
Question
is,
why'd
you
let
us
in
at
all?
-
An
audition
for
what?
We
extracted
every
bit
of
information
But
your
deception
was
obvious.

[EDITH
PIAF'S

-
So
leave
me
and
go.
That
corporation
that
hired
us,
We
won't
last
two
days.
Cobb?
Looks
like
I'm
gonna
have
to
do
this
Tell
us
what
you
know!

I've
always
hated
this
carpet.
It's
stained
and
frayed
But
very
definitely
made
of
wool.
Right
now...
...I'm
lying
on
polyester.
Which
means
I'm
not
lying
You
have
lived
up
to
your
reputation,
I'm
still
dreaming.

-
How'd
it
go?
Dream
within
a
dream,
huh?
But
in
my
dream,
you
play
by
my
rules.
Ah,
yes,
but
you
see,
Mr.
Saito...
We're
not
in
your
dream.
We're
in
mine.



Asshole.
-
It
wasn't
my
fault.
I
didn't
know
That's
enough.
You.
What
the
hell
was
all
that?
-
I
have
it
under
control.
We
don't
have
time
for
this.
He's
not
gonna
check
every
compartment.
Yeah,
well,
I
don't
like
trains.
Listen.
Every
man
for
himself.

Yes,
hello?
Hi,
Daddy.
Hey,
guys.
Hey.
How
are
you?
Good.
Okay?
Who's
just
okay?
Yeah.
When
are
you
coming
home,
Dad?
Well,
I
can't,
sweetheart.
I
can't.
Why?
Look,
I
told
you,
I'm
away
Grandma
says
you're
never
coming
back.
Phillipa,
is
that
you?
Put
Grandma
on
the
phone
for
me,
She's
shaking
her
head.
Well,
just
hope
she's
wrong
about
that.
Daddy?
Yeah,
James?
Is
Mommy
with
you?
James,
we
talked
about
this.
Mommy's
not
here
anymore.
Where?
That's
enough,
kids.
Say
bye-bye.
Listen,
I'm
gonna
send
some
presents
And
you
be
good,
you
be-


-
Our
ride's
on
the
roof.
Hey,
are
you
okay?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
Why?
Well,
down
in
the
dream,
Look,
I'm,
uh,
sorry
about
your
leg.
-
It's
getting
worse,
isn't
it?
-
Where's
Nash?
We
were
supposed
to
deliver
...to
Cobol
Engineering
two
hours
ago.
By
now,
they
know
we
failed.
-
Where
you
gonna
go?
I
can
lie
low
there,
maybe
sniff
out
Stateside.
Send
my
regards.
He
sold
you
out.
Thought
to
come
So
I
offer
you
the
satisfaction.
It's
not
the
way
I
deal
with
things.

-
What
will
you
do
with
him?
But
I
can't
speak
for
Cobol
Engineering.
-
What
do
you
want
from
us?
-
Is
it
possible?
If
you
can
steal
an
idea
...why
can't
you
plant
one
there
instead?
Okay,
here's
me
planting
I
say,
"Don't
think
about
elephants."
Elephants.
Right.
But
it's
not
your
idea,
The
subject's
mind
can
always
trace
-
True
inspiration's
impossible
to
fake.
-
Can
you
do
it?
Because
I
can
find
my
own
way
Then
you
do
have
a
choice.
Then
I
choose
to
leave,
sir.
Tell
the
crew
where
you
want
to
go.
Hey,
Mr.
Cobb.
How
would
you
like
to
go
home?
To
America.
To
your
children.
You
can't
fix
that.
No
one
can.
-
Just
like
inception.
-
How
complex
is
the
idea?
No
idea
is
simple
when
you
need
My
main
competitor
is
His
son
will
soon
inherit
control
I
need
him
to
decide
to
break
up
-
Cobb,
we
should
walk
away
from
this.
If
I
were
to
do
this,
...I'd
need
a
guarantee.
-
How
do
I
know
you
can
deliver?
But
I
can.
So
do
you
want
to
take
a
leap
of
faith...
...or
become
an
old
man,
...waiting
to
die
alone?
Assemble
your
team,
Mr.
Cobb.
Look,
I
know
how
much
This
can't
be
done.
Yes,
it
can.
You
don't
know
that.
I've
done
it
before.
Who'd
you
do
it
to?
Why
are
we
going
to
Paris?
We're
gonna
need
a
new
architect.

You
never
did
like
your
office,
did
you?
No
space
to
think
Is
it
safe
for
you
to
be
here?
Extradition
between
France
...is
a
bureaucratic
nightmare,
I
think
they
might
find
a
way
Look,
I,
uh,
brought
these
for
you
to
give
It'll
take
more
than
...to
convince
those
children
I'm
just
doing
what
I
know.
I
never
taught
you
to
be
a
thief.
No,
you
taught
me
to
navigate
But
after
what
happened...
...there
weren't
a
whole
lot
of
legitimate
What
are
you
doing
here,
Dom?
I
think
I
found
a
way
home.
It's
a
job
People
who
I
believe
can
fix
But
I
need
your
help.
You're
here
to
corrupt
You
know
what
I'm
offering.
-
Money.
You
remember.
It's
the
chance
to
build
cathedrals,
...things
that
never
existed...
...things
that
couldn't
exist
So
you
want
me
to
let
someone
else
They
don't
actually
come
into
the
dream.
They
just
design
the
levels
Design
it
yourself.
Mal
won't
let
me.
Come
back
to
reality,
Dom.
-
Please.
Those
kids,
your
grandchildren...
...they're
waiting
for
their
father
to
come
And
this
job,
this
last
job,
I
would
not
be
standing
here
I
need
an
architect
I've
got
somebody
better.
Ariadne?
I'd
like
you
to
meet
Mr.
Cobb.
Pleased
to
meet
you.
If
you
have
a
few
moments,
Mr.
Cobb
has
A
work
placement?
Not
exactly.
I
have
a
test
for
you.
You're
not
gonna
tell
me
anything
first?
Before
I
describe
the
job,
-
Why?
You
have
two
minutes
to
design
a
maze
Stop.
Again.
Stop.
You're
gonna
have
to
do
better
than
that.
That's
more
like
it.
They
say
we
only
use
a
fraction
Now,
that's
when
we're
awake.
When
we're
asleep,
Such
as?
Imagine
you're
designing
a
building.
But
sometimes,
it
feels
like
it's
almost
Yeah,
like
I'm
discovering
it.
Genuine
inspiration,
right?
Now,
in
a
dream,
We
create
and
perceive
And
our
mind
does
this
so
well
That
allows
us
to
get
right
-
How?
Now,
this
is
where
I
need
you.
You
create
the
world
of
the
dream.
We
bring
the
subject
into
that
dream,
How
could
I
ever
acquire
enough
detail
Well,
dreams,
they
feel
real
It's
only
when
we
wake
up
that
we
realize
Let
me
ask
you
a
question.
You
never
really
remember
You
always
wind
up
I
guess,
yeah.
So
how
did
we
end
up
here?
Well,
we
just
came
from
the,
uh...
Think
about
it,
Ariadne.
Where
are
you
right
now?
We're
dreaming?
You're
in
the
middle
This
is
your
first
lesson


If
it's
just
a
dream,

Because
it's
never
just
a
dream,
is
it?
And
a
face
full
of
glass
hurts
like
hell.
That's
why
the
military
It
was
a
training
program
for
soldiers
...and
then
wake
up.
How
did
architects
become
involved?
Well,
someone
had
to
design
Why
don't
you
give
us
Five
minutes?

What-?
We
were
talking
In
a
dream,
your
mind
...therefore
time
seems
Five
minutes
in
the
real
world
Why
don't
you
see
what
you

You've
got
the
basic
layout.
Almost
everything
else
is
here
too.
Who
are
the
people?
-
Yours?
Remember,
you
are
the
dreamer.
I
am
the
subject.
My
mind
populates
it.
You
can
literally
talk
That's
one
of
the
ways
we
extract
How
else
do
you
do
it?
By
creating
something
secure,
The
mind
automatically
fills
it
-
You
understand?
Well...
I
guess
I
thought
that
the
dream
space
...but
it's
more
about
the
feel
of
it.
My
question
is
what
happens
when
you

It's
something,
isn't
it?
Yes,
it
is.
Why
are
they
all
looking
at
me?
Because
my
subconscious
feels
that
The
more
you
change
things,
the
quicker
Converge?
They
sense
the
foreign
nature
They
attack,
like
white
blood
cells
-
What,
they're
gonna
attack
us?
Just
you.

This
is
great,
but
I'm
telling
you,
Jeez,
mind
telling
your
subconscious
It's
my
subconscious.
Very
impressive.
I
know
this
bridge.
Yeah,
I
cross
it
every
day
Never
re-create
places
from
your
memory.
You
draw
from
stuff
you
know,
right?
Only
use
details.
A
streetlamp
-
Why
not?
...is
the
easiest
way
to
lose
your
grasp
-
Is
that
what
happened
to
you?
This
has
nothing
to
do
That
why
you
need
me
Hey,
get
off
of
her.
Back
up.
Back
up.
-
Cobb!
Cobb!
-
Let
me
go!
Let
me
go!
-
Mal!
-
Wake
me
up!
Wake
me
up!
-
Mal,
no!
No!

Hey,
hey,
hey.
Look
at
me.
-
Hey.
There
was
still
time
on
the
clock.
You
can't
wake
up
from
-
She'll
need
a
totem.
A
totem,
it's
a
small
personal-
That's
some
subconscious
-
She's
a
real
charmer.
-
I
see
you
met
Mrs.
Cobb.
Yeah.
So
a
totem.
You
need
Something
you
can
have
on
you
Like
a
coin?
It
needs
to
be
more
unique
than
that.
No,
I
can't
let
you
touch
it.
See,
only
I
know
the
balance
and
That
way,
...you
know
beyond
a
doubt
that
I
don't
know
if
you
can't
see
what's
...but
Cobb
has
some
serious
problems
And
I'm
not
about
to
just
open
my
mind

She'll
be
back.
I've
never
seen
anyone
Reality's
not
gonna
be
enough
for
her
now,
When
she
comes
back,
-
Where
are
you
gonna
be?
Eames?
No,
he's
in
Mombasa.
It's
a
necessary
risk.
-
Well,
there's
plenty
of
good
thieves.
We
need
a
forger.
Rub
them
together
all
you
want,
You
never
know.
I'm
gonna
get
you
a
drink.
You're
buying.
-
Your
spelling
hasn't
improved.
How's
your
handwriting?
-
It's
versatile.
Thank
you
very
much.
Inception.
Now,
before
you
bother
telling
me
No,
it's
perfectly
possible.
Interesting.
Because
Arthur
keeps
Hmm.
Arthur.
You
still
working
He
is
good
at
what
he
does,
right?
Oh,
he's
the
best,
Not
like
you.
Listen,
if
you're
gonna
perform
inception,
Let
me
ask
you
something.
We
tried
it.
Uh,
we
got
the
idea
in
place,
-
You
didn't
plant
it
deep
enough?
You
need
the
simplest
version
...in
order
for
it
to
grow
naturally
So,
what
is
this
idea
We
need
the
heir
of
a
major
corporation
Right
there
you
have
...and
anti-monopolistic
sentiments
But
all
of
that
stuff,
it's,
um...
It's
really
at
the
mercy
of
your
What
you
have
to
do
is
Which
is
what?
The
relationship
with
the
father.
-
Do
you
have
a
chemist?
Right.
Okay,
well,
He,
uh,
formulates
his
own
versions
Why
don't
you
take
me
there?
Once
you've
lost
your
tail.
Cobol
Engineering.
That
price
on
my
head,
Don't
remember.
Run
interference.
I'll
meet
you
downstairs
-
Back
here?

All
right.
Freddy.
Freddy
Simmonds.
My
God,
it's
you,
isn't
it?

No,
it
isn't
you.
Not
dreaming
now,
are
you?

Get
him!
There!

Shh.

One
caf.
One

Care
for
a
lift,
Mr.
Cobb?
-
What
are
you
doing
in
Mombasa?

Ah.
So
this
is
your
idea
Different
tail.

Cobb
said
you'd
be
back.
-
I
tried
not
to
come,
but...
It's
just...
...pure
creation.
Shall
we
take
a
look
You're
gonna
have
to
master
...if
you're
gonna
build
three
complete
What
kind
of
tricks?
In
a
dream,
you
can
cheat
architecture
That
lets
you
create
closed
loops,
The
infinite
staircase.
See?
Paradox.
So
a
closed
loop
like
that...
...will
help
you
disguise
the
boundaries
But
how
big
do
these
levels
have
to
be?
It
could
be
anything
They
have
to
be
complicated
enough
-
A
maze?
And
the
better
the
maze...
Then
the
longer
we
have
Exactly.
-
My
subconscious
seems
polite
enough.
No
one
likes
to
feel
someone
else
Cobb
can't
build
anymore,
can
he?
I
don't
know
if
he
can't,
but
he
won't.
He
thinks
it's
safer
Why?
He
won't
tell
me.
But
I
think
it's
Mal.
-
His
ex-wife?
-
They're
still
together?
No,
she's
dead.
What
you
see
in
there
What
was
she
like
in
real
life?
She
was
lovely.
You
are
seeking
a
chemist?
To
formulate
compounds
for
a
job?
And
to
go
into
the
field
with
us.
No,
I
rarely
go
into
the
field,
Mr.
Cobb.
Well,
we'd
need
you
there
to
tailor
-
Which
are?
A
dream
within
a
dream?
Two
levels?
Three.
Not
possible.
That
many
dreams
It
is
possible.
A

sedative.

How
many

members?
Six.
The
only
way
to
know
you've
done
the
job
There's
no
room
for
tourists
This
time,
it
seems
there
is.
This,
I
think,
is
a
good
place
to
start.
What
for?
Perhaps
you
will
not
want
to
see.
After
you.

Ten.
Twelve.
All
connected.
Bloody
hell.
They
come
every
day
to
share
the
dream.
You
see?
Very
stable.
-
How
long
do
they
dream
for?
In
dream
time?
With
this
compound?
About
40
hours,
-
Why
do
they
do
it?
After
a
while,
it
becomes
Do
you
still
dream,
Mr.
Cobb?
-
They
come
here
every
day
to
sleep?
They
come
to
be
woken
up.
The
dream
has
become
their
reality.
Who
are
you
to
say
otherwise,
sir?
Let's
see
what
you
can
do.

You
know
how
to
find
me.
You
know
what
you
have
to
do.
Sharp,
no?
Are
you
all
right,
Mr.
Cobb?
Yeah,
yeah.
Everything's
just
fine.
Robert
Fischer,
heir
to
the
Fischer
Morrow
What's
your
problem
with
this
Mr.
Fischer?
That's
not
your
concern.
Mr.
Saito,
this
isn't
your
typical

asked
me
for
inception.
I
do
hope
you
understand
Now,
the
seed
that
we
plant
This
idea
will
define
him.
It
may
come
to
change...
Well,
it
may
come
to
change
We're
the
last
company
standing
And
we
can
no
longer
compete.
Soon,
they'll
control
the
energy
supply
In
effect,
they
become
The
world
needs
Robert
Fischer
That's
where
we
come
in.
How
is
Robert
Fischer's
relationship
Rumor
is
the
relationship
Well,
we
can't
work
based
Can
you
get
me
access
to
this
man
here?
Fischer
Senior's
right-hand
man.
It
should
be
possible,
References
are
something
I'm
not
smelling
Mr.
Browning...
...Maurice
Fischer's
policy
Well,
shall
we
voice
your
concerns
Not
sure
that's
necessary.
No,
no,
no.
I
think
we
should.
How
is
he?
I
don't
want
to
bother
him
Robert,
I
told
you
keep
out
Mr.
Fischer.
Never,
never.
Leave
that.
Here.
Must
be
a
cherished
memory
of
his.
I
put
it
beside
his
bed.
Robert...
...we
need
to
talk
about
-
I
know
this
is
hard,
but
it's
imperative-
The
vultures
are
circling.
And
the
sicker
Maurice
Fischer
becomes,
I've
had
ample
opportunity
...and
adopt
his
physical
presence,
study
his
So
now
in
the
first
layer
of
the
dream,
And
suggest
concepts
Then,
when
we
take
him
...his
own
projection
of
Browning
So
he
gives
himself
the
idea.
Precisely.
That's
the
only
way
it
will
stick.
Eames,
I
am
impressed.
Your
condescension,
as
always,

Were
you
going
under
on
your
own?
No,
no,
I
was
just,
uh,
running
I
didn't
realize
anyone
was
here,
so...
Yeah,
I
was
just-
Here,
let
me
take
a
look.
So
you're
learning,
huh?
An
elegant
solution
-
Was
it
your
idea?
It
was
Mal's,
actually.
This...
This
one
was
hers.
She
would
spin
it
Just
spin
and
spin.
Arthur
told
me
she
passed
away.
How
are
the
mazes
coming
along?
Each
level
relates
to
the
part
...that
we
are
trying
to
access.
So
I'm
making
the
bottom
level
a
hospital,
You
know,
l-
Actually,
I
have
a
question
No,
no,
no.
Don't
show
me
specifics.
Why
is
that
so
important?
In
case
one
of
us
brings
in
We
don't
want
them
knowing
You
mean
in
case
you
bring
Mal
in.
You
can't
keep
her
out,
can
you?
-
Right.
...because
if
you
know
the
maze,
Well,
she'd
sabotage
-
Cobb,
do
the
others
know?
You've
gotta
warn
them
No
one
said
it's
getting
worse.
I
need
to
get
home.
Why
can't
you
go
home?
Because
they
think
I
killed
her.
-
Thank
you.
For
not
asking
whether
I
did.
"I
will
split
up
my
father's
empire."
Now,
this
is
obviously
an
idea
that
...which
is
why
we
need
to
plant
it
deep
The
subconscious
is
motivated
We
need
to
find
a
way
to
translate

That's
what
we're
here
to

to

the

for

We

Fischer
to

try
this.
Um...
"My

That
might
work.
Might?
We're
gonna
need
to
do
Thank
you
for
your
contribution,
Arthur.
Forgive
me
for
wanting
Specificity?
Inception's
not
about
being
specific.
When
we
get
inside
his
mind,
we're
On
the
top
level,
we
open
up
...and
say,
"I
will
not
follow
Then
the
next
level
down,
we
feed
him,
Then,
by
the
time
we
hit
the
bottom
level,
-
"My
father
doesn't
want
me
to
be
him."

That's

years.
Who'd
wanna
be

Depends
on
the

So
once
we've
made
the
plant,
I'm
hoping
you
have
something
more
-
A
kick.
This,
Ariadne,
would
be
a
kick.
It's
that
feeling
of
falling
you
get
-
Snaps
you
out
of
the
dream.
That's
the
clever
part.
I
customized
the
sedative
to

way,

The
trick
is
to
synchronize

of

in
the

He
must
be
flying
private,
then.
Not
if
there
were
unexpected
It
would
have
to
be
a

On
a
747,
the

...the

in
the

You'd
have
to
buy
out
the
entire
cabin
I
bought
the
airline.
It
seemed
neater.
Well,
looks
like
we
have
our
10
hours.
Ariadne?
Terrific
work,
by
the
way.

You
know
how
to
find
me.
You
know
what
you
have
to
do.
You
remember
when
you
asked
me
Of
course
I
do.
You
said
you
had
a
dream.
That
we'd
grow
old
together.
And
we
can.
You
shouldn't
be
here.
Just
wanted
to
see
what
kind
of
tests
-
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
you.
-
You've
asked
me
to
share
dreams
with
you.
Why
do
you
do
this
to
yourself?
It's
the
only
way
I
can
still
dream.
Why
is
it
so
important
to
dream?
In
my
dreams,
we're
still
together.
These
aren't
just
dreams.
These
are
memories.
I
know
I
did.
You're
trying
to
keep
her
alive.
You
don't
understand.
They're
memories
that
I
have
to
change.
Well,
what's
down
there
that
you
regret?
Listen,
there's
only
one
thing
This
is
your
house?
Mine
and
Mal's,
yes.
Where
is
she?
She's
already
gone.
That's
my
son,
James.
He's
digging
for
something,

That's
Phillipa.
I
thought
about
calling
out
to
them...
...so
they'd
turn
and
smile
...those
beautiful
faces
of
theirs,
Right
now
or
never,
Cobb.
Then
I
start
to
panic.
I
realize
I'm
gonna
regret
this
moment...
...that
I
need
to
see
their
faces
James!
Phillipa!
Come
on
in!
But
the
moment's
past.
And
whatever
I
do,
As
I'm
about
to
call
out
to
them...
...they
run
away.
If
I'm
ever
gonna
see
their
faces
again,
The
real
world.


What
are
you
doing
here?
My
name
is-
I
know
who
you
are.
I'm
just
trying
to
understand.
How
could
you
understand?
Do
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
lover?
To
be
half
of
a
whole?
No.
I'll
tell
you
a
riddle.
You're
waiting
for
a
train.
A
train
that
will
take
you
far
away.
You
know
where
you
hope
...but
you
don't
know
for
sure.
But
it
doesn't
matter.
How
can
it
not
matter
to
you
Because
you'll
be
together.
How
could
you
bring
her
here,
Dom?
This
is
a

What
happened
here?
You
promised!
Please,
I
need
you
to
stay
here
You
said
we'd
be

I'll
come
back
for
you.
I
promise.

you
think
you
can
just

Do
you

Maurice
Fischer
just
died
in
Sydney.
-
When's
the
funeral?
Robert
should
accompany
the
body
All
right.
-
Cobb,
I'm
coming
with
you.
The
team
needs
someone
who
And
it
doesn't
have
to
be
me...
...but
then
you
have
to
show
Arthur
Get
us
another
seat
on
the
plane.
If
I
get
on
this
plane
...when
we
land,
Complete
the

en
route...
...I
make
one
phone
call
from
the
plane...
...you
have
no
trouble
-
I'm
sorry.
Thank
you.
Excuse
me,
I
think
this
is
yours?
Would
you
care
for
a
drink?
Oh.
Water,
please.
Oh,
um,
same,
please.
Um...
Thank
you.
You
know,
I
couldn't
help
but
notice...
...but
you
wouldn't
happen
to
be
related
Yes,
he,
um...
He
was
my
father.
Well,
he
was
a
very
inspiring
figure.
-
Here
you
go.
Hey.
To
your
father.
May
he
rest
in
peace,
huh?


-
Couldn't
have
peed
before
you
went
under?
Bit
too
much
free
champagne
Ha,
ha,
bloody
ha.
We
know
he's
gonna
be
looking
for
a
taxi
-
Asshole!
Hey,
man,
why
don't
you
try-?
[MAN

Just

him
ca-
I

All
right.
Taxi.
Thank
you.
All
right,
Third

Market.
Snappy.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
It's
not.
Maybe
not.
Great.
Come
on.
There's
$500
in
there.
You
might
at
least
I'm
afraid
that
it
doesn't-


-
Cover
him!
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
This
wasn't
in
the
design.
Cobb?
Cobb?


Get
him!
Are
you
all
right?
Yeah,
I'm
okay.
I'm
okay.
Fischer's
okay,
unless
he
gets
carsick.
Saito?
Get
Fischer
in
the
back
room
now.
-
Get
him
in
the
back
room.
Move.
Has
he
been
shot?
Is
he
dying?
I
don't
know.
What
happened
to
you?
Why
put
a
train
-
I
didn't.
Why
the
hell
were
we
ambushed?
Those
were
not
normal
projections.
-
How
could
he
be
trained?
...teach
his
subconscious
to
defend
itself,
It
should've
shown
in
the
research.
Why
the
hell
didn't
it?
Don't
tell
me
to
calm
down!
This
was
your
job,
goddamn
it!
You
were
meant
to
check
-
We
are
not
prepared
for
this!
We'll
be
more
careful
This
was
not
a
part
of
the
plan!
Put
him
out
his
misery.
-
No,
don't
do
that!
Don't
do
that.
He's
in
agony.
I'm
waking
him
up.
No.
It
won't
wake
him
up.
What
do
you
mean,
it
won't
wake
him
up?
Not
from
this.
We're
too
heavily
sedated
Right.
So,
what
happens
when
we
die?
-
We
drop
into
limbo.
-
Limbo?
Well,
what
the
hell
is
down
there?
Nothing
is
down
there,
except
for
...by
anyone
sharing
the
dream
Which,
in
our
case,
is
just
you.
-
How
long
could
we
be
stuck?
...trying
to
escape
until
the
sedation-
Decades.
It
could
be
infinite.
Let's
get
him
upstairs.

Great.
Thank
you.
So
now
we're
trapped
in
Fischer's
mind,
And
if
we
get
killed...
...we'll
be
lost
in
limbo
till
our
brains
Someone
got
first
aid?
-
You
knew
these
risks
and
didn't
tell
us?
-
I
didn't
know
we'd
be
dealing
with
gunfire.
This
was
the
only
way
You
knew
about
this
I
trusted
him.
When?
When
he
promised
you
No.
His
whole
share.
What,
with
Mal?
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
You
led
us
into
a
war
zone
There
is
a
way
out.
We
continue
on
with
...and
we
get
out
using
the
kick,
Forget
it.
We
go
any
deeper,
I
am
sitting
this
one
out
on
this
level.
Fischer's
security
Ten
hours
of
flight
time
That
means
each
and
every
one
of
us
We
have
no
other
choice
but
to
continue
on
Downwards
is
the
only
way
forwards.
Get
ready.
You,
come
on.
Let's
go
shake
him
up.
I'm
insured
against
kidnapping
-
This
should
be
very
simple.
In
your
father's
office,
...is
his
personal
safe.

I
don't
know
any
safe.
That
doesn't
mean
Tell
us
what
it
is.
I
don't
know.
We
have
it
on
good
authority
Yeah?
Whose
authority?
-
Five
hundred
dollars,
this
cost.
Cash,
cards,
ID.
And
this.
Useful?
Maybe.
You're
on.
You've
got
an
hour.
An
hour?
I
was
supposed
to
have
all
night
And
Saito
wasn't
supposed
You've
got
one
hour,

-
What's
that?
Uncle
Peter.
Just
make
them
stop.
-
The
combination.
-
Why
does
Browning
say
you
do?
Just
let
me
talk
to
him
You
have
one
hour.
Start
talking.
You
all
right?

You
okay?
Those
bastards
have
had
at
me
They
have
someone
with
access
-
They're
trying
to
open
his
safe.
They
thought
I'd
know
the
combination,
-
Yeah,
well,
neither
do
I,
so...
Maurice
told
me
that
when
he
passed,
No,
he
never
gave
me
any
combination.
Maybe
he
did.
I
mean,
maybe
you
Well,
what,
then?
I
don't
know,
some
meaningful
...based
on
your
experiences
We
didn't
have
very
many,
uh,
Perhaps
after
your
mother
died.
After
my
mother
died,
"Robert,
Oh,
well,
he
was
bad
with
emotion.
I
was
11,
Uncle
Peter.
-
How's
he
doing?
When
we
get
down
to
the
lower
levels,
And
if
he
dies?
Worst-case
scenario?
When
he
wakes
up,
Cobb,
I'll
still
honor
the
arrangement.
I
appreciate
that,
Saito.
But
when
you
wake
up,
you
won't
even
Limbo
is
gonna
become
your
reality.
You're
gonna
be
lost
down
there
so
long
Filled
with
regret?
Waiting
to
die
alone.
No.
I'll
come
back.
And
we'll
be
young
men
together
again.
Breathe.
These
people
are
gonna
kill
us
-
They
just
wanna
ransom
us.
They're
gonna
lock
us
in
that
van,
All
right.
What
is
in
the
safe?
Something
for
you.
Maurice
always
said
-
A
will.
That's
an
alternate.
This
would
supersede
the
other
It
splits
up
the
component
businesses
It'd
be
the
end
of
the
entire
empire
Destroying
my
whole
inheritance?
-
Why
would
he
suggest
such
a
thing?
He
loved
you,
Robert.
In
his
own
way.
In
his
own
way.
At
the
end...
...he
called
me
in
to
his
deathbed.
He
could
barely
speak.
But
he
took
the
trouble
He
pulled
me
close.
And
I
could
only
make
out...
...one
word.
"Disappointed."

When
were
you
in
limbo?
You
might
have
the
rest
of
the
team
-
But
they
don't
know
the
truth.
The
truth
that,
at
any
minute,
you
might
The
truth
that
Mal
is
bursting
And
the
truth
that,
...we're
also
going
deeper
into
you.
And
I'm
not
sure
We
were
working
together.
We
were
exploring
the
concept
I
kept
pushing
things.
I
wanted
to
go
deeper
and
deeper.
I
just
didn't
understand
the
concept
that
...that
we
could
get
trapped
so
deep...
...that
when
we
wound
up
on
the
shore
...we
lost
sight
of
what
was
real.
We
created.
We
did
that
for
years.
We
built
our
own
world.
How
long
were
you
stuck
there?
Something
like
50
years.
Jesus.
How
could
you
stand
it?
It
wasn't
so
bad
at
first,
The
problem
was
knowing
Eventually,
it
just
became
impossible
And
what
about
for
her?
She
had
locked
something
away,
A
truth
that
she
had
once
known,
Limbo
became
her
reality.
What
happened
when
you
woke
up?
Well,
to
wake
up
from
that
...to
become
old
souls
thrown
back
I
knew
something
was
wrong
with
her.
Eventually,
she
told
me
the
truth.
She
was
possessed
by
an
idea.
This
one
very
simple
idea
That
our
world
wasn't
real.
That
she
needed
to
wake
up
...that
in
order
to
get
back
home...
...we
had
to
kill
ourselves.
-
What
about
your
children?
...that
our
real
children
were
waiting
I'm
their
mother!
I
can
tell
the
difference.
If
this
is
my
dream,
You
don't
know
you're
dreaming!
She
was
certain
...no
matter
how
much
I
begged,
She
wanted
to
do
it,
She
loved
me
too
much,
so
she
came
up
-
Sweetheart,
what
are
you
doing?
Just-
Just
step
back
inside.
All
right?
No.
I'm
going
to
jump,
No,
I'm
not.
Now,
you
listen
to
me.
If
you
jump,
you're
not
gonna
wake
up,
Now,
just
step
back
inside.
Come
on.
Step
back
inside
We've
talked
enough.
-
Mal.
...or
I'll
jump
right
now.
We're
gonna
talk
about
this.
All
right?
-
I'm
asking
you
to
take
a
leap
of
faith.
No,
I
can't.
You
know
I
can't
do
that.
Take
a
second,
think
about
our
children.
Think
about
James.
Think
about
Phillipa,
now.
If
I
go
without
you,
-
What
does
that
mean?
...explaining
how
I'm
fearful
How
you've
threatened
to
kill
me.
-
Why
did
you
do
this?
Why
did-?
Why
would
you
do
this
to
me?
I've
freed
you
from
the
guilt
We're
going
home
to
our
real
children.
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
Mal,
you
listen
to
me,
You're
waiting
for
a
train.
-
Mal,
goddamn
it,
don't
do
this!
James
and
Phillipa
are
waiting
for
you!
You
know
where
you
hope
this
train
-
Mal,
look
at
me!
-
Mal,
goddamn
it!
Mal,
listen
to
me!
Sweetheart!
Look
at
me!
Mal,
no!
Jesus
Christ!
She
had
herself
declared
sane
It
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
try
So
I
ran.

Right
now,
or
never,
Cobb.
James!
Phillipa!
Come
on
in!
Come
on!
All
right,
let's
go.
I
left
my
children
behind
and
I've
been
Your
guilt
defines
her.
But
you
are
not
responsible
And
if
we
are
gonna
succeed
in
this...
...you
have
to
forgive
yourself,
But
you
don't
have
to
do
that
alone.
-
No,
you're
not...
Because
they
have
no
idea
the
risk
We
have
to
move.
Time's
up.
All
right.
I
don't
know
any
combination.
-
Not
consciously,
anyway.
I
got
somebody
in
your
father's
office
Give
me
the
first
six
numbers
-
I
have
no
idea.
I
said,
right
now!
Right
now!
Five,
two,
eight,
four,
nine,
one.
You'll
have
to
do
better
than
that.
All
right.
Bag
them.
We're
worth
more
to
you
alive.
What'd
you
get?
Relationship
with
his
father
This
helps
us
how?
The
stronger
the
issues,
-
How
are
we
gonna
reconcile
them?
Work
faster.
We
gotta
break
out
of
here
Damn
it.
You
mustn't
be
afraid
to
dream
We
need
to
shift
his
animosity
-
Destroy
his
one
positive
relationship?
...whilst
exposing
his
godfather's
We
should
charge
Fischer
a
lot
more
His
security
is
gonna
-
I
think
we
run
with
Mr.
Charles.
Who's
Mr.
Charles?
The
second
we
get
into
that
hotel
We
run
with
Mr.
Charles
-
You've
done
it
before?
The
subject
realized
he
was
dreaming
Excellent.
But
you
learned
a
lot,
right?
-
I
need
some
kind
of
distraction.
How
about
a
lovely
lady
Listen
to
me.
Everything
down
there
is
Don't
jump
too
soon.
We
only
got
I'll
play
the
music
to
let
you
know
-
You
ready?
Sweet
dreams.
Am
I
boring
you?
I
was
telling
you
my
story.
Um,
I
have
a
lot
on
my
mind.
There
goes
Mr.
Charles.
Mr.
Fischer,
right?
Pleasure
to
see
you
again.
Hmm.
-
And
you
must
be?
In
case
you
get
bored.
Must've
blown
you
off.
That
is,
unless
her
phone
number
Funny
way
to
make
friends,

Goddamn
it.
The
wallet
alone
About
$500,
right?
Don't
worry
about
it.
Who
or
what
is
Mr.
Charles?
It's
a
gambit
designed
to
turn
Fischer
And
why
don't
you
approve?
It
involves
telling
the
mark
...which
involves
attracting
-
Didn't
Cobb
say
never
to
do
that?
So
now
you've
noticed
how
much
time...
...Cobb
spends
doing
things
Mr.
Saito,
can
I
have
a
moment?
-
I'm
sorry,
but...
You
look
a
bit
perkier.
Very
amusing,
Mr.
Eames.

Turbulence
on
the
plane?
No,
it's
much
closer.
That's
Yusuf's
driving.


Um,
I'm
sorry.
Rod
Green
from
marketing.
But
that's
not
true
at
all,
is
it?
My
name
is
Mr.
Charles.
I'm
the
head
of
your
security
down
here.
Get
out
on
a
different
floor,
Dump
the
wallet.
-
Okay.

Security,
huh?
-
You
work
for
the
hotel?
I
specialize
in
a
very
specific
type
Subconscious
security.
You're
talking
about
dreams?
Are
you
talking
about,
um,
extraction?
I
am
here
to
protect
you.



Mr.
Fischer,
I'm
here
...that
someone
tries
to
access
You're
not
safe
here.
They're
coming
for
you.

Strange
weather,
isn't
it?
You
feel
that?
What's
happening?
Cobb's
drawing
Fischer's
attention
...which
is
making
his
subconscious
For
me.
Quick,
give
me
a
kiss.
-
They're
still
looking
at
us.
We
should
probably
get
out
of
here.

You
feel
that?
You've
actually
Pay
attention
to
the
strangeness
None
of
this
is
real.
You're
in
a
dream.
Now,
the
easiest
way
...is
to
try
and
remember
how
you
arrived
Yeah,
I...
No,
breathe,
breathe.
Accept
the
fact
that
you're
in
a
dream,
Mm-hm.
-
You're
not
real?
No.
I'm
a
projection
I
was
sent
here
to
protect
you
...that
extractors
And
I
believe
that's
what's
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Can
you
get
me
out
of
here?
Right
away.
Follow
me.
Hold
on
a
second.
Jesus
Christ!
What
are
you
doing?
These
men
were
sent
here
If
you
want
my
help,
I
need
you
to
work
with
me,
Mr.
Fischer.
If
this
is
a
dream,
I
should
just
I
wouldn't
do
that
if
I
were
you,
I
believe
they
have
you
sedated,
...you
may
not
wake
up.
You
may
go
into
a
further
dream
state.
You
remember
the
training.
Remember
what
I
said
to
you.
Give
me
the
gun.
-
This
room
should
be
directly
below
528?

Think,
Mr.
Fischer,
think.
What
do
you
remember
There
was,
um,
a
lot
of
gunfire.
There
was
rain.
Uncle
Peter.
-
Oh,
my
God,
we've
been
kidnapped.
-
They
had
us
in
the
back
of
a
van.
You're
in
the
back
of
a
van.
It
had
something
to
do
with,
um...
Something
to
do
with
a
safe.
God,
why
is
it
so
hard
to
remember?
It's
like
trying
to
remember
a
dream
Listen,
it
takes
years
of
practice.
You
and
Browning
have
been
pulled
...because
they're
trying
to
steal
I
need
you
to
focus
and
try
What
is
it,
Mr.
Fischer?
Think!
A
combination.
They
demanded
They're
trying
to
extract
a
number
It
can
represent
anything.
We
should
try
hotel
rooms.
Try
and
remember
for
me.
Five.
Five,
two-
It
was
something,
That's
good.
We
can
start
there.
Yep.
-
So
do
you
use
a
timer?
While
you're
all
asleep
in
528,
-
Well,
how
will
you
know?
And
then
when
the
van
hits
the
barrier
So
we
get
a
nice
synchronized
kick.
If
it's
too
soon,
But
if
it's
too
late,
-
Well,
why
not?
-
Can't
drop
you
without
gravity.
They're
with
me.
Go
on.
Mr.
Charles.
-
Do
you
know
what
that
is,
Mr.
Fischer?
They
were
trying
to
put
you
under.
-
I'm
already
under.
What
do
you
mean,
Hey.
I
see
you've
changed.
I'm
sorry?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Oh.
Good-looking
fellow,
I'm
sure.
No,
no,
no.
That's
Fischer's
Let's
follow
him
-
Why?
...if
Fischer
is
starting
to
suspect
Shh.

-
Uncle
Peter.
Well,
not
exactly.
They
already
had
him.
And
you
saw
them
torture
him?
The
kidnappers
are
working
for
you?
Robert.
You're
trying
to
get
that
safe
open?
Fischer
Morrow
has
been
my
entire
life.
I'm
not
gonna
throw
away
I
couldn't
let
you
rise
-
What
taunt?
That's
his
last
insult.
A
challenge
for
you
to
build
something
...by
telling
you
you're
not
worthy
-
What,
but
that
he
was,
um,
disappointed?
But
he's
wrong.
You
can
build
a
better
company
Mr.
Fischer?
He's
lying.
-
How
do
you
know?
He's
hiding
something,
I
need
you
to
do
the
same
thing
to
him
We'll
enter
his
subconscious
and
find
out
All
right.

He's
out.
Whose
subconscious
are
We're
going
into
Fischer's.
I
told
him
it
was
Browning's
He's
gonna
help
us
break
That's
right.
Security's
gonna
run
you
down
hard.
And
I
will
lead
them
on
a
merry
chase.
-
Just
be
back
before
the
kick.
You
good?
Hey.
You
ready?
Yes,
yes.
I'm
fine.
I'm
ready.
Cobb?
Cobb?
What's
down
there?
Hopefully,
the
truth
I
mean,
what's
down
there
for
you?










Did
you
see
that?
Eames,
this
is
your
dream.
I
need
you
to
draw
the
security
away
-
Who
guides
Fischer
in?
If
I
know
the
route,
-
I
designed
the
place.
I
could
do
it.
All
right.
Brief
him
on
the
route
-
Fischer,
you'll
be
going
with
him.
You
keep
this
live.
The
windows
on
that
upper
floor
are
big
You're
not
coming
in?
In
order
to
find
out
the
truth
...you're
gonna
need
to
break
into
Come
on,
Fischer!

-
Sound
the
alarm!
Sound
the
alarm!
Move!
Go!

Sod
it.
I
hope
you're
ready.


No,
it's
too
soon.

Cobb,
do
you
hear
that?
I
first
noticed
it
about
20
minutes
ago,
Yeah,
I
hear
it.
It's
music.
So,
what
do
we
do?
We
move
fast.
Yusuf's
10
seconds
from
the
jump.
Which
gives
Arthur
three
minutes.
-
Hey!
-
Which
gives
us
what?
-
Can
they
make
that
route
in
an
hour?
Then
they
need
a
new
route,

It's
designed
as
a
labyrinth.
There
must
be
access
routes
Eames?

Did
Eames
add
any
features?
I
don't
think
I
should
tell
you.
We
don't
have
time
for
this.
He
added
an
air-duct
system
Good.
Explain
it
to
them.
Saito?

Paradox.


What
was
that?
Cobb!
Cobb,
did
we
miss
it?
Yeah,
we
missed
it.
Man.
Couldn't
someone
have
dreamt
up
Uh-huh.
Well,
what
the
hell
do
we
do
now?
We
finish
the
job
before
the
next
kick.
-
What
next
kick?
If
you'd
like
to
If
you
need
help,
hang
up...
How
do
I
drop
you
without
gravity?
Arthur
has
a
couple
minutes,

You
okay?
Run!
Turn
around!
Go,
go,
go!
There's
something
wrong.
They're
heading
your
way,
Just
buy
us
more
time,
all
right?
-
Come
on!
Come
on!
Move!


All
right.

Okay.
That's
the
antechamber
-
Does
the
strong
room
have
windows?
Let's
hope
Fischer
likes
-
Are
those
projections
his
subconscious?
-
Are
you
destroying
parts
of
his
mind?


-
We're
here.
There's
an
entire
army
headed
your
way.



There
he
is.
-
There's
someone
in
there.
Come
on.
Come
on,
a
little
lower.
Cobb.
No,
she
is
not
real.
How
do
you
know
that?
She
is
just
a
projection.

Hello.
Eames!
What
happened?
I
couldn't
shoot
her.
There's
no
use
in
reviving
him.
It's
all
over.
So
that's
it,
then?
We
failed?
We're
done.
I'm
sorry.
It's
not
me
that
doesn't
get
back
Shame.
I
wanted
to
know
what
was
Let's
set
the
charges.
No,
there's
still
another
way.
-
We
have
to
follow
Fischer
down
there.
No,
but
there
will
be
enough
time
And
we
will
find
him.
Okay,
as
soon
as
Arthur's
music
kicks
in,
We
can
give
him
his
own
kick
Look,
you
get
him
in
there.
As
soon
as
the
music
ends,
...and
we
all
ride
the
kick
It's
worth
a
shot,
if
Saito
can
hold
Saito
will
never
make
it,
will
he?
-
Cobb,
come
on.
We've
gotta
try
this.
If
you
are
not
back
before
the
kick,
She's
right.
She's
right.
Can
I
trust
you
to
do
Mal's
gonna
be
down
there.
I
know
where
to
find
her.
-
How
do
you
know?
She
wants
me
back
down
there
with
her.
All
right?
-
This
is
your
world?
And
this
is
where
she'll
be.
Come
on.

Saito.
Saito.
I
need
you
to
take
care
of
Fischer
No
room
for
tourists
on
these
jobs.
Don't
be
silly.
You
built
all
this?
This
is
incredible.
We
built
for
years.
Then
we
started
in
on
the
memories.
This
way.
This
was
our
neighborhood.
Places
from
our
past.
That
was
our
first
apartment.
Then
we
moved
to
that
building
After
Mal
became
pregnant,
You
reconstructed
all
of
this
Like
I
told
you,
we
had
lots
of
time.
What
is
that?
That's
the
house
Mal
grew
up
in.
-
Well,
will
she
be
in
there?
Come
on.
We
both
wanted
to
live
in
a
house,
In
the
real
world,






How
are
we
gonna
bring
Fischer
back?
We're
gonna
have
to
come
up
What?
I'm
gonna
improvise.
Listen,
there's
something
you
should


An
idea
is
like
a
virus.
Resilient.
Highly
contagious.
And
the
smallest
seed
It
can
grow
to
define...
...or
destroy
you.
The
smallest
idea,
such
as:
"Your
world
is
not
real."
Simple
little
thought
So
certain
of
your
world.
Of
what's
real.
Do
you
think
he
is?
Or
do
you
think
he's
as
lost
as
I
was?
I
know
what's
real,
Mal.
No
creeping
doubts?
Not
feeling
persecuted,
Dom?
Chased
around
the
globe...
...by
anonymous
corporations
...the
way
the
projections
Admit
it.
You
don't
believe
in
one
reality
anymore.
So
choose.
Choose
to
be
here.
Choose
me.

You
know
what
I
have
to
do.
I
have
to
get
back
to
our
children
Because
you
left
us.
-
You're
wrong.
You're
confused.
Our
children
are
here.
And
you'd
like
to
see
their
faces
again,
Yes,
but
I'm
gonna
see
them




Up
above?
Listen
to
yourself.
Watch.
James?
Phillipa?
Don't
do
this,
Mal.
Please.
You
keep
telling
yourself
that,
-
No,
I
know
it.
What
if
I'm
what's
real?
You
keep
telling
yourself
what
you
know.
But
what
do
you
believe?
What
do
you
feel?
Guilt.
I
feel
guilt,
Mal.
And
no
matter
what
I
do,
...no
matter
how
confused,
...reminding
me
of
the
truth.
What
truth?
That
the
idea
that
caused
you
to
question
You
planted
the
idea
in
my
mind?
What
is
she
talking
about?
The
reason
I
knew
inception
was
possible
-
I
did
it
to
my
own
wife.
We
were
lost
in
here.
I
knew
we
needed
to
escape,
She
had
locked
something
away,
A
truth
that
she
had
once
known,
And
she
couldn't
break
free.
So
I
decided
to
search
for
it.
I
went
deep
into
the
recess
of
her
mind
And
I
broke
in...
...and
I
planted
an
idea.
A
simple
little
idea
That
her
world
wasn't
real.
That
death
was
the
only
escape.
You're
waiting
for
a
train.

A
train
that'll
take
you
far
away.
You
know
where
you
hope
...but
you
can't
know
for
sure.
Yet
it
doesn't
matter.
-
Now,
tell
me
why!
But
I
never
knew
that
that
idea
...that
even
after
she
woke...
That
even
after
...that
you'd
continue
to
believe
That
death
was
the
only
escape.
Mal,
no!
Jesus!
-
You
infected
my
mind.
You
betrayed
me.
But
you
can
make
amends.
We
can
still
be
together,
right
here...
...in
the
world
we
built
together.








Cobb,
we
need
to
get
Fischer.
You
can't
have
him.
-
If
I
stay
here,
will
you
let
him
go?
Fischer
is
on
the
porch.
-
Go
check
he's
alive,
Ariadne.
Go
check
he's
alive
right
now.
Do
it.

He's
here!
And
it's
time,
You
take
Fischer
with
you,
all
right?
I'm
not.
Saito's
dead
by
now.
That
means
he's
down
here
somewhere.
I
can't
stay
with
her
anymore,
I'm
the
only
thing
No.
I
wish.
I
wish
more
than
anything,
but...
...I
can't
imagine
you
...all
your
perfection,
-
You
all
right?
Look
at
you.
You're
just
a
shade.
And
you
were
the
best
...I'm
sorry,
you're
just
not
good
enough.
Does
this
feel
real?

-
What
are
you
doing?

No,
no,
no!
In
there,
now.
Go,
go,
go.
I
was
dis-
I
was
dis-
Disa-
-
I
know,
Dad.
I
know
you
were
disappointed...
...I
couldn't
be
you.
No.
No,
no,
no.
I
was
disappointed...
...that
you
tried.

What?
Come
on,
come
on.
Dad?

That's
the
kick,
Ariadne!
Don't
lose
yourself!
I
will!
You
remember
when
you
asked
me
Yes.
You
said
you
dreamt
But
we
did.
We
did.
You
don't
remember?
I
miss
you
more
than
I
can
bear...
...but
we
had
our
time
together.
And
I
have
to
let
you
go.
I
have
to
let
you
go.
I'm
sorry,
Robert.

You
know,
the
will
means
that
Dad
...not
just
to
live
for
him.
That's
what
I'm
gonna
do,
Uncle
Peter.
What
happened?
-
Cobb
stayed.
No,
to
find
Saito.
He'll
be
lost.
No,
he'll
be
all
right.
Have
you
come
to
kill
me?
I'm
waiting
for
someone.
Someone
from
a
half-remembered
dream.
Cobb?

Impossible.
We
were
young
men
together.
I'm
an
old
man.
Filled
with
regret.
Waiting
to
die
alone.
I've
come
back
for
you.
To
remind
you
of
something.
Something
you
once
knew.
That
this
world
is
not
real.
To
convince
me
to
honor
To
take
a
leap
of
faith,
yes.
Come
back...
...so
we
can
be
Come
back
with
me.
Come
back.
Hot
towel,
sir?
We'll
be
landing
in
Los
Angeles
Do
you
need
immigration
forms?
Thank
you.
Hot
towel,
sir?
-
No.
Welcome
home,
Mr.
Cobb.
Thank
you,
sir.
Welcome.
This
way.
James?
Phillipa?
Look
who's
here.
Hey.
-
Hey,
guys!
Hey!
How
are
you?
Daddy!
Look
what
I've
been
building!
-
What
are
you
building?
On
the
cliff?
Come
on,
I
want
you
Let's
go.
