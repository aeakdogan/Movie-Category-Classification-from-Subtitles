For

A

Oh,
y-y-you're
gonna

You
could

Yes,
I
could.
Even
if
you

Now,
if
I

she's
dead
anyway.
You

12
minutes.
If
he
doesn't
call
LUTHER:
Anything?
Negative.
DECLAN:
How
about
you?
No,
nothing.
Come
on,
Ethan.

What
is
that?
When
I
was

I
had

Jules.
We've

an
explosive
charge
Does
that
sound
familiar?

The
Rabbit's
Foot.
I
gave
it
to
you.
Now,
I'm
going
to
count
to
10
and
you're
going
to
tell
me
or
she

Seems
we
have
a

Do
you

I'm
playing?
Do

Where
is
it?
Look
at

Don't
do
this.
I
promise
you.
I

you
know
is
right.
No,

No.
No.

BROWNWAY:
I
pushed
him
MUSGRAVE:
I
understand.
I've
got
some
questions
It's
complicated.
You
can't
just
We
had
to
make
sure
The
Rabbit's
Foot.
Don't
you
touch
her!
Davian's
translator,
Remember?
At
the
Vatican
Ethan,
Julia
is
still
alive.
Davian
wanted
but
I
convinced
him
otherwise.
Julia
hasn't
seen
me.
She
can
go
on
to
have
a
life.
As
long
as
you
tell
me,
I
know
she
sent
you
Did
Lindsey
know
Is
that
why
she
Did
anyone
else
see
it?
Did
she
know
about
Could
I
be

Did
she
buy
Did
she
buy
that?
You
told
him.
That's
how
Davian
knew
You
told
him.
I
thought
you
could
But
I
wasn't
gonna
I
took
action,
Ethan,
The
Armed

You
grab
Davian
like
he
wanted,
then
what?
Davian's
a

You
cut
him
out,
Arrest
him?
Then

ETHAN:
BENJI:
There
is
one

Okay,
there's
a
bridge.
Make
a
left.
I
got
it.
I
got
it.

Good,

Make
your
next

And
then
follow
that
down
A
thousand
yards.
Okay.
Okay,
okay.
Okay,
okay.
Left.
Left.
Yeah,
that's
good.
Okay,
now
look...
Hiya.
Hi.
ETHAN:
Benji,

Benji?
Which
way
do
I
go?

Okay.
Go
down,

Left?
I'm
going

told
you
I
was
Well,
I'm
going
to


JULIA:
Ethan?
Are
you
okay?
I
don't
understand
I
know.
I
know.
Just
wait.
What
do
those
men
Why
are
we
here?
Please,
Ethan.

Are
you
okay?
Ethan,
what's
wrong?
I'm
going
to
Ethan.
What's
happening?
We've
got
to
get
out
of
here.
They
don't
have
one!
A
defibrillator.
Ethan?
Ethan?
Who
are
these
people?
Good!
This
is
a

The
empty

falls
out
and
you
shove
like
the
batteries
then
release
the

Why
are
you
giving
me
a
gun?
If
you
have
to
use
it,
You
identify
your
enemy.
It's
very
simple.
Stand
back.
Good.
I
have
a
charge
in
my
head.
What?
Don't
forget
the

You
can
bring
me
back.
I
can't.
Now!
Please!
Wait,

Wow.

JULIA:
So,
I
was
thinking
you
I
know.
I...
I
work
for
an
agency.
It's
called
IMF.
What
does
that
stand
for?
Impossible
Mission

Shut
up.
No,
I'm
not
kidding.
You
don't
understand.
JULIA:
You
can
trust
me.
ETHAN:
Yeah,
I
know.
BRASSEL:
Just
wanna
Call
it

You
should
know
