JOY:
Do
you
ever
look
"What
is
going
on
inside
their
head?"
Well,
I
know.
Well,
I
know
Riley's
head.

Hmm?

JOY:
And
there
she
was...
Hello.
Riley.
Oh,
look
at
you.
Aren't
you
a
little
bundle
of
joy?

Aren't
you
a
little
bundle
of
joy?
Whoa.

JOY:
It
was
amazing.

JOY:
Er,
for
33
seconds?
I'm
Sadness.
Oh,
hello.
I...
I'm
Joy.
So...
Can
I
just...
If
you
could...
I
just
want
to
fix
that.
Thanks.
JOY:
And
that
was
just
the
beginning.
Headquarters
only
got

Very
nice.
Okay,
looks
like
FEAR:
Whoa,
sharp
turn!
JOY:
That's
Fear.
He's
really
good
at
keeping
Riley
safe.
FEAR:
Easy,
easy.
Ah!

-Whew!
Good
job.
-And
we're
back!
-
Here
we
go.
All
right,
open.
-Hmm.
This
looks
new.
-What
is
it?
Okay,
caution.
-Hold
on.
What
is
that?
She
basically
keeps
Riley
Physically
and
socially.
That
is
not
brightly
colored
or
shaped
like
a
dinosaur.
It's
broccoli!

Yucky!
Well,
I
just
saved
our
lives.
-BOTH:
Whew!
Riley,
if
you
don't
eat
your
dinner,
you're
not
gonna
get
any
dessert.
Wait.
Did
he
just
say
JOY:
That's
Anger.
He
cares
very
deeply
So
that's
how
you
No
dessert?
Oh,
sure,
Right
after
you
eat
this!

Riley,
Riley,
here
comes
an
airplane!

Oh,
airplane.
-ALL:
Oh!
JOY:
And
you've
met
Sadness.

JOY:
I'm
not
actually
sure
And
I've
checked,
there's
no
place
for
her
to
go,
so...
She's
good,
we're
good.
It's
all
great!
Anyway,
these
are
Riley's
memories
and
they're
mostly
happy,
-MEG:
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
JOY:
But
the
really
important
ones
I
don't
want
to
get
too
technical,
but
these
are
called
Core
Memories.
Each
one
came
from
Uh,
like
when
she
first
scored
a
goal.
Oh,
that
was
so
amazing!
Hey!
Would
you
look
at
that?
Very
nice!
-We
got
a
future
center
here!

JOY:
And
each
Core
Memory
powers
a
different
aspect
Like
Hockey
Island.
Goofball
Island
is
my
personal
favorite.
Ah,
come
back
here,
you
little
monkey!
DAD:

Oh,
you're
silly.
JOY:
Yep,
Goofball
is
the
best.
Friendship
Island
is
pretty
good
too.

JOY:
Oh,
I
love
Honesty
Island.
And
that's
the
truth!
And
of
course,

JOY:
The
point
is,
are
what
make

JOY:
That's
what
I'm
talking
about!
Whoo!
Another

Nice

everybody!
Let's
get
those
memories
All
right,
we
did
not

today!
I
call
that
an
unqualified
success.
JOY:
And
that's
it.
We
love
our
girl.
She's
got
great
friends
Things
couldn't
be
better.
After
all,
Riley's
1

now.
What
could
happen?
-What...
-

Okay,
not
what
I
had
in
mind.


JOY:
Hey,

Isn't
that
great?
It's

Are

kidding?
-
-These
are
my
kind
of
people.
DAD:
All
right,
just
a
few
more
blocks.
We're
almost
to
our
new
house!
Step
on
it,
Daddy!
Why
don't
we
just
live
in
this
smelly
car?
We've
already
been
in
it
forever.
Which,
actually,
was
really
lucky,
because
that
gave
us
what
our
new
house
is
going
to
look
like!
What!
Let's
review
-Ooh!
That
looks
safe!
Oh,
this
will
be
great
for
Riley!
JOY:
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
this
one!
DISGUST:
Oh,
Joy,
for
the
last
time,
ANGER:
That's
the
one!
JOY:
Now
we're
getting
close,
Here
it
is,
here's
our
new
house.
And...
Maybe
it's
nice
on
the
inside.

ANGER:
We're
supposed
to
live
here?
DISGUST:
I'm
telling
you,
Can
you
die
from
moving?
Guys,
you're
overreacting.
Nobody
is
dying...
-A
dead
mouse!
ANGER:
Great.
This
is
just
great.
It's
the
house
of
the
dead!
-Get
off
of
me!
Hey.
All
through
the
drive,
Dad
talked
about
-
DISGUST:
Let's
go!
FEAR:
Yes,
yes,
yes.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
DISGUST:
I'm
starting
ANGER:
Get
out
the
rubber
ball,
we're
in
solitary
confinement.
Riley
can't
live
here.
-She's
right.
FEAR:
Really
bad.
DISGUST:
It's
the
worst
place
Hey,
it's
nothing
I
read
somewhere
-Where
did
you
read
that?
I
read
it
and
it's
great.
We'll
put
the
bed
there.
JOY:
And
the
desk
over
there.
FEAR:
The
hockey
lamp
goes
there.
ANGER:
Uh,
put
the
chair
there.
JOY:
The
trophy
collection
goes
there.
FEAR:
Stars!
I

JOY:
Now
we're
talking!
Let's
go

our

DAD:
All
right.
Goodbye.
Well,
guess
what?
The
moving
van
-You're
kidding.
The
van
is
lost?
It
is
the
worst
day
ever!
DISGUST:
That
figures.
The
van
is
lost.
You
said
it
would
be
here
yesterday!
I
know
that's
what
I
said.
FEAR:
Mom
and
Dad
are
stressed
out!
ANGER:
They're
stressed
out?
-
Did
you
even
read
the
contract?
Andersen
makes
her
move.
Hey!

DAD:
Oh,
no,
you're
not!
She's
lining
up
for
the
shot!
DAD:
Coming
behind
you.
-DAD:
Watch
out!
Watch
out!
-Yeah!
-Come
on,
Grandma!
"Grandma"?
Uh-oh,
she
put
her
hair
up,
Whoo!
-Hey,
put
me
down!


-
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
-Hello?
DAD:
You're
kidding.

All
right.
Stall
for
me.
I'll
be
right
there.
The
investor's
supposed
not
today!
-
It's
okay.
We
get
it.
You're
the
best.
Thanks,
hon.
See
you,
sweetie.
FEAR:
Dad
just
left
us.
He
doesn't
love
us
anymore.
That's
sad.
I
should
drive,
right?
Joy?
What
are
you
doing?
Uh,
just
give
me
one
second.
Um,
you
know
what
I've
realized?
Riley
hasn't
had
lunch!
Remember?
Hey,
I
saw
a
pizza
place
down
the
street.
Maybe
we
could
try
that?
Pizza
sounds
delicious.
-Pizza?
That's
good.
FEAR:
What
the
heck
is
that?
That's
it.
I'm
done.
Congratulations,
San
Francisco,
you've
ruined
pizza!
First
the
Hawaiians
and
now
you!
What
kind
of
a
pizza
place
MOM:
Must
be
Still,
it's
not
as
bad
as
that
soup.
-At
that
diner
in
Nebraska.
The
spoon
stood
up
in
the
soup
by
itself!
RILEY:
That
was
disgusting.
JOY:
Oh,
good.
Family
is
running.
RILEY:
Dad's
got
a
steel
stomach.
The
drive
out
was
pretty
fun,
huh?
What
was
your
favorite
part?
Spitting
out
the
car
window!
Definitely
not
when
Dad
was
singing.
Wearing
a
seat
belt!
Oh!
What
about
the
time
-Oh,
that's
the
one.
DAD:
Say
cheese!
-Dad!
Dad!
DAD:
Now
hold
still.
Stop!
No,
no,
no!



Nice
one,
Joy.
I
liked
that
time
at
the
dinosaur.
-That
was
pretty
funny.

Wait.
What?
What
happened?
FEAR:
She
did
something
-What
did
you
do?
-That
shouldn't
make
it
change.
-I'm
trying.
-No!
I
guess
I
can't!
Now
when
Riley
thinks
she's
gonna
feel
sad.
-Bravo.
I
don't
really
know...
I
thought
maybe
if
you...

Joy,
we've
got
a
stairway
coming
up.
Just
don't
touch
any
other
memories
until
we
figure
out
what's
going
on.
-Okay.
Get
ready.
This
is
a
monster
railing
and
we
are
riding
it
all
the
way
down!
-Wait,
what?
What
happened?
-
Oh,
no!
Sadness,
what
are
you
doing?
SADNESS:
It
looked
like
so
I
opened
it
and
then
it
fell
out.
I...
Whoo-hoo!
It's
just
that...
-FEAR:
Joy!
Sadness,
you
nearly
And
when
you
touch
them,
I
know.
I'm
sorry.
Something's
wrong
with
me.
It's
like
I'm
having
a
breakdown.
You're
not
having
I
keep
making
mistakes
like
that.
-No,
you're
not.

You
know
what?
You
can't
focus
on
what's
going
wrong.
There's
always
a
way
to
to
find
the
fun.
Yeah.
Find
the
fun.
I
don't
know
how
to
do
that.
Okay.
Well,
try
to
think
of
something
funny.
Um...
Oh!
Remember
the
funny
movie
Oh.
Yeah,
that's
not...
What
about
that
time
with
Meg
when
Riley
laughed
so
hard
milk
came
out
of
her
nose?

Yeah.
That
hurt.
It
felt
like
fire.
SADNESS:
Ooh,
it
was
awful.
Okay,
okay,
don't
think
of
that.
Uh,
what
are
your
favorite
things
to
do?
My
favorite?
Um...
Well,
I
like
it
when
we're
outside.
That's
good.
Like
there's
Oh!
Like
that
time
we
buried
Dad
SADNESS:
I
was
thinking
more
like
rain.
Rain?
Rain
is
my
favorite,
too!
We
can
stomp
around
in
puddles.
JOY:
You
know,
there's
cool
umbrellas,
SADNESS:
More
like
when
and
makes
our
shoes
soggy.
And
we
get
all
cold,
shivery,
and
everything
just
starts
Oh,
hey,
hey.
Hey,
easy.
Why
are
you
crying?
It's
just
like
really
the
opposite
Crying
helps
me
slow
down
and
obsess
over
the
weight
of
life's
problems.

You
know
what?
Let's,
uh,
think
about
something
else.

How
about
we
read
-Sounds
fun.
Well,
have
you
read
this
one?
"Long

-No.

See?
Fun
already!
Oh,
you
lucky
dog.
You're
reading
these
cool
things.
I
got
to
go
work.
Life
is
so
unfair.



DAD:
What
can
we
do?
to
last
a
month,
maybe
two.
If
we
can't
find
investors
by
then,
we're
going
to
have
to
lay
people
off.
Mom!
Dad!
Come
kiss
me
good
night!
DAD:
I
know.
I
know.
DAD:
We've
got
to
land
this,
okay?
Did
you
hear
Dad?
-

What
was
that?
There
are
no
bears
in
San
Francisco.
I
saw
a
really
hairy
guy.
Oh,
I'm
so
jumpy.
My
nerves
are
shot.
Ew!
I
don't
want
to
I'll
tell
you
what
it
is.

Look,
I

You
guys
have
concerns.
But
we've
been
through
worse!
Tell
you
what,
Riley
should
be
happy
about.
Fine.
Let's
see,
this
house
stinks,
-Pizza
is
weird
here.
And
all
of
our
stuff
is
in
the
missing
van!
Oh,
come
on.
It
could
be
worse.
Yeah,
Joy.
We
could
be
Okay,
I
admit
it,
we
had
a
rough
start.
But
think
of
all
the
good
things
that...
No,
Joy.
There's
to
be
happy
right
now.
Let
us
handle
this.
I
say
we
skip
school
tomorrow
and
lock
ourselves
in
the
bedroom.
We
have
no
clean
clothes.
Yeah,
we
could
cry
We
should
lock
the
door

you

I
can
keep
smiling,
it
would
be
a
big

We
can
do
that
for
him.
Right?
Whoa.
JOY:
Well.
Yeah,

What
did
we
do
to
deserve
you?
-Sweet

Well,

can't
argue
with

So
you

Oh.

Okay,

I'm

much
everyone
It's
kind
of
a
family
tradition.
We
go
out
on
the
lake
Or
we
did,
till
I
moved
away.
-Hey,
what
gives?
Hey,
Sadness!
You
touched
Oh,
yeah,
I
know.
I'm
sorry.
Get
back
in
your
circle.
-Why
won't
it
eject?

We
used
Cool
kids
whispering
at
three
o'clock!
FEAR:
Did
you
see
that
look?
They're
judging
us!

JOY:
Somebody
help
me!
But
everything's
different
now.
Since
we
moved.

Oh,
no!
We're
crying!
At
school!
What?
Sadness!
What
are
you
doing?
Oh,
no!
Oh,
I'm
sorry!
JOY:
Huh?
FEAR:

It's
a
Core
Memory!
But
it's
blue.

No!
Wait!
Stop
it!
No!
Ah!
No!
Joy,
no.
-That's
a
Core
Memory!
-Joy,
wait!
FEAR:
Ah!
The
Core
Memories!


No,
no,
no,
no!
-Whoa!

TEACHER:
Thank
you,
Riley.
I
know
it
can
be
tough
but
we're
happy
to
have
you
here.
All
right,
everyone,
and
turn
to
chapter
seven.
Can
I
say
that
curse
word
now?

-
Oh,
no!
One,
two,
three.
Okay.
I
got
them.
Where
are
we?
Long
Term
Memory?
Wait...
Goofball
Island?
SADNESS:
They're
all
down!
Oh!
This
is
bad.
We...
We
can
fix
this!
We
just
have
to
plug
the
Core
Memories
in,
and
Riley
will
be
back
to
normal.
Riley
has
no
Core
Memories.
No
Personality
Islands
and
no...

What?
What
is
it?
You.
You're
not
in
Headquarters.
Without
you,
Riley
can't
be
happy.
We
got
to
get
you
back
up
there.
I'm
coming,
Riley.
So,
as
it
turns
out,
the
green
trash
can
is
not
recycling,
it's
for
greens.
-Like
compost.
And
eggshells.
And
the
blue
one
is
recycling.
-MOM:
And
the
black
one
is
trash.
Why
is
she
acting
so
weird?
What
do
you
expect?
Joy
would
know
what
to
do.
That's
it.
Until
she
gets
back,
Great
idea.
Anger,
Fear,
Disgust,
how
are
we
supposed
to
be
happy?
MOM:
Hey,
Riley.
I've
got
good
news!
I
found
a
junior
hockey
league
And
get
this:
Try-outs
are
tomorrow
after
school.
What
luck,
right?
-Hockey?

Guys,
this
is...
You
pretend
to
be
Joy.
Won't
it
be
great
to
be
Oh,
yeah,
that
sounds
fantastic.
What
was
that?
-Uh,
because
I'm
not
Joy.
Did
you
guys
pick
up
on
that?
-Mmm-hmm.
Something's
wrong.
Should
we
ask
her?
Let's
probe.
But
keep
it
subtle,
so
she
doesn't
notice.
So,
how
was
the
first
day
of
school?
She's
probing
us.
I'm
done.
You
pretend
to
be
Joy.
What?
Okay.
Um,
hmm.
It
was
fine,
I
guess.
I
don't
know.
Oh.
Very
smooth.
That
was
just
like
Joy.
Something
is
definitely
going
on.
She's
never
acted
like
this
before.
We're
going
to
But
we'll
need
support.
Signal
the
husband.
Ahem!
ANNOUNCER:
With
a
nice
comes
across
...and
nice!

Uh-oh.
She's
looking
at
us.
What?
Oh!
Sorry,
sir.
Is
it
garbage
night?
What?
What
is
it,
woman?
What?
Ugh,
he's
making
that
stupid
face
again.
MOM'S
ANGER:
I
could
Signal
him
again.
Ah!
So,
Riley,
how
was
school?
-You
got
to
be
kidding
me!
For
this
we
gave
up
Move!
I'll
be
Joy.
School
was
great,
all
right?
Riley.
Is
everything
okay?
Ugh!
Sir,
she
just
rolled
her
eyes
at
us.
What
is
her
deal?
All
right,
make
a
show
of
force.
I
don't
want
to
have
to
No,
not
the
foot!
Riley,
I
do
not
like
this
new
attitude.
Oh,
I'll
show
you
attitude,
old
man.
No.
No,
no,
no!
Stay
happy!
What
is
your
problem?
Sir,
reporting
high
levels
of
sass!
Take
it
to
DEFCON
Two.
You
heard
that,
gentlemen.

Listen,
young
lady,
I
don't
know
where
this
disrespectful
attitude
came
from...
You
want
a
piece
of
this,
pops?
Come
and
get
it!
Yeah,
well...
Well...
Here
it
comes.
Prepare
the
foot!
Keys
to
safety
position.
Ready
to
launch
on
your
command,
sir!

Just
shut
up!
Fire!
That's
it!
Go
to
your
room!
Now!
Uh!

The
foot
is
down!
The
foot
is
down!

Good
job,
gentlemen.
That
could
have
been
a
disaster.
Well,
that
was
a
disaster.
Come
fly
with
me,
gatinha.



We're
going
to
walk
out
there?
On
that?
JOY:
It's
the
quickest
way
back.
But
it's
right
over
the
Memory
Dump.
If
we
fall,
we'll
be
forgotten
forever.
We
have
to
do
this
for
Riley.
-Oh,
okay.
It's
totally
fine...

No!

-
Hey.
So,
uh,
things
got
a
little
Do
you
want
to
talk
about
it?
Come
on,
where's
my
happy
girl?
Monkey.
Oh,
he's
trying
to
start
up
Goofball.
DAD:
Come
on!




Ah!
Go
back!
Run,
run,
run!



What...
I
get
it.
You
need
some
alone
time.
We'll
talk
later.
DISGUST:
We
have
a
major
problem.
FEAR:
Oh,
Joy,
where
are
you?
SADNESS:
We
lost
Goofball
Island.
That
means
she
can
lose
Friendship
and
Hockey
and
Honesty
and
Family.
You
can
fix
this,
right,
Joy?
I,
uh...
I
don't
know.
-Oh...
Okay,
come
on.

-Riley's
gone
to
sleep.
Which
is
a
good
thing.
When
you
think
about
it
because
nothing
else
bad
We'll
be
back
to
Headquarters
We'll
just
go
across
Friendship
Island.
Oh,
we'll
never
make
it.
-Oh,
no!
Don't
obsess
over
Remember
the
funny
movie
Oh,
Sadness,
We'll
just
have
to
go
around.
SADNESS:
Wait,
Joy,
Think
positive!
SADNESS:
Okay.
I'm
positive
SADNESS:
That's
Long
Term
Memory.
An
endless
warren
I
read
about
it
in
the
manuals.
The
manuals?
The
manuals!
-You
read
the
manuals!
So
you
know
I
guess.
Ooh!

You
are
my
map!
Let's
go!
Lead
on,
my
map!
Show
me
where
we're
going!
Okay.
Only
I'm
too
sad
to
walk.
Just
give
me
a
few...hours.
Ooh!
JOY:
Which
way?
Left?
SADNESS:
Right.
No.
I
mean,
go
left.
I
said
left
was
right.
Like
"correct."
JOY:
Okay.
SADNESS:
This
actually
Okay,
here
we
go!
We'll
be
back
to
Headquarters
We
can
do
it!
This
will
be
easy!

This
is
not
working.
SADNESS:
Yeah,
just
another
right.
And...a
left
and
then
another...left
and...
Uh,
are
you
sure
Because
we
seem
to
be
Riley's
awake.
Ooh!
Oh!

Don't
touch.
Remember?
If
you
touch
them,
they
stay
sad.
Oh,
sorry,
I
won't.
Starting
now.
Oh,
I
can't
take
much
more
of
this.
FORGETTER
BOBBY:
Forget
them!
Mind
workers!
But,
Joy,
we're
almost...

Phone
numbers.
We
don't
need
all
these.
-Excuse
me,
hi.
-I
need
to
find
Friendship
Island.
Four
years
of
piano
lessons.
FORGETTER
BOBBY:
Yeah,
You
know
what?
Save
Chopsticks
and
Heart
and
Soul,
get
rid
of
the
rest.
-Are
you...
Yeah,
just
keep
-Forget
'em!
You
can't
throw
those
away!
Those
are
perfectly
good
memories.
The
names
of
Yes!
That
is
critical
information!
JOY:
Glitterstorm,
Honeypants...
Forget
'em!
Hey!
Bring
those
back!
They're
in
the
dump.
Nothing
Yeah.
Look,
lady,
this
is
our
job,
okay?
When
Riley
doesn't
care
-Fades?
Yeah,
except
for
this
bad
boy.

is
