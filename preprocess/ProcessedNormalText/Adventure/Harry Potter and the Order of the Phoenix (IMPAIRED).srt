did

you,

Happy,
are
we,
now?
You've
finally
done
it.
Well,
just
look
at
him,
Petunia.
I've
reached
my
limit,
do
you
hear?
This
is
the
last
I'm
gonna
take
-
Dear
Mr.
Potter.
The
Ministry
has
received
intelligence
...you
performed
the
Patronus
Charm
As
a
clear
violation...
...of
the
Decree
for
the
Reasonable
...you
are
hereby
expelled...
...from
Hogwarts
School
Hoping
you
are
well,

Sorry,
Hedwig.
Very
clean,
these

for
God's
sake.
Professor
Moody.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
But
where
are
we
going?
No
you
haven't
been.
Not
yet.
But
the
letter
said...
Dumbledore
has
persuaded
the
minister
...pending
a
formal
hearing.
Don't
worry.
We'll
explain
everything
Not
here,
Nymphadora.
Don't
call
me
Nymphadora.
Stay
in

everyone.
Come
on.
In

No

No

He
almost
killed
Harry.
Yes,
but
guarding
you-know-what
We
must
trust
Dumbledore
on
this.
Was
he
able
to
protect
Harry
last
year?
Cornelius
Fudge
is
a
politician
-
His
instinct
would
be
to
ignore
it...
He's
getting
stronger
and
stronger

Harry.
Heavens,
you're
all
right.
Bit
peaky,
but

afraid

to
explain.
Yeah.

Oh,
Harry.
Are
you
all
right?
We
overheard
them
-
You
must
tell
us
everything.
And
this
hearing
at
the
Ministry.
I've
looked
it
up.
-
It's
completely
unfair.
There's
a
lot
of
that
So,
what
is

It's

of

gone

wanted
to
write,
mate.

Only...
Only
Dumbledore
made
us
swear
Dumbledore
said
that?
But
why
would
he
keep
me
in
the
dark?
After
all
I'm
I'm
the
one
who
I'm
the
one
who
fought
him,
-
Harry.

Don't
bottle
it
up,
though,
mate.
Let
it
out.
Do
you
wanna
hear
something
If
anyone
has
a
right
to
know,
it's
Harry.
...we
wouldn't
even
know
He's
not
a
child,
Molly.
But
he's
not
an
adult
either.
-
He's
not
James,
Sirius.
He's
as
good
as.
-
Who
else
has
he
got?

He's
got

You

you're

is

I
don't
understand.

He'll
find
out

He's
been
attacking
Dumbledore
as
well.
Fudge
is
using
all
his
power,
including
...to
smear
anyone
who
claims
Why?
The
Minister
thinks
Dumbledore's
after
his
job.
But
that's
insane
no
one
in
their
right
mind
Exactly
the
point.
It's
been
twisted
and
warped
by
fear.
Now,

to

you
really

feels

keep

suppose
I'll
see

at

I
love

they
are.

It's

What'd
you
expect?
Hi,

Hey,

What
is
it?

What's
what?

It's

you'll
all
join

Now,
as
usual,
our
caretaker,
Mr.
Filch,
She
was
at
my
hearing.
Thank
you,
headmaster,
And
how
lovely
to
see
all
your
bright...
...happy

smiling
up
at
me.
I'm
sure
we're
all
going

you,

Seamus.
-
Good
holiday?
Better
than
Seamus',
anyway.
Me
mum
didn't
want
me
-
Why
not?
The
Daily
Prophet's
been
saying
What,
your
mum
believes
them?
Well
nobody
was
there
the
night
Cedric
died.
Well
I
guess
you
should
read
the
Prophet,
then,
-
Don't
you
dare
talk
about
my
mother
like
that.
-
What's
going
on?
Do
you
believe
the
rubbish
he's
come
out
Yeah.
I
do.
Has
anyone
else
My
grandmother
says
the
daily
prohet
is
rubbish.
She's
cancelled
her
subscription.
-
You
all
right?
Seamus
was
bang
out
of
order,
mate.
-
But
he'll
come
through,
you'll
see.
Right.
I'll
just
leave
you
Harry.
Go
on

Go
on
go

Go

hard
and
you
will
be
rewarded.
Fail
to
do
so,
Your
previous
instruction
in
this
subject
But
you'll
be
pleased
to
know,
...you
will
be
following
...course
of
defensive
magic.
Yes?
There's
nothing
in
here
Using
spells?
Well,
I
can't
imagine
why
you
would
We're
not
gonna
use
magic?
You'll
be
learning
about
defensive
spells
What
use
is
that?
Students
will
raise
their
hands
It
is
the
view
of
the
Ministry...
...that
a
theoretical
knowledge
...to
get
you
through
your
examinations...
...which,
after
all,
And
how's
theory
supposed
to
prepare
us
There
is
nothing
out
there,
dear.
Who
do
you
imagine
Oh,
I
don't
know.
Now,
let
me
make
this
quite
plain.
You
have
been
told...
...that
a
certain
dark

This
is
a
lie.

Mr.
Potter.
So
according
to
you
Cedric
Diggory
dropped
dead
Cedric
Diggory's
death
It
was
murder.
Voldemort
killed
him.
You
must
know
that!
Enough!
Enough.
See
me
later,
Mr.
Potter.
My
office.
Come
in.
Good
evening,
Mr.
Potter.
Sit.
You're
going
to
be
doing
some
lines
No,
not
with
your
quill.
Going
to
be
using
Now...
...I
want
you
to
write,
How
many
times?
Well,
let's
say
for
as
long
as
it
takes
You
haven't
given
me
any
ink.
Oh,
you
won't
need
any
ink.
Yes?
-
Nothing.
Because
you
know,
deep
down...
...you
deserve
to
be
punished.
Don't
you,
Mr.
Potter?
Go
on.
-

Snackboxes.
Get
you
out
of

whenever
you
like.
Obtain
hours
of
pleasure
Care
for
another?
-
I'm
not
asking
you
to
write
all
of
it
for
me.
It's
just
..

I've
been
busy
studying
I'll
do
the
introduction.
That's
all.
Hermione,
you're
honestly
-
And
if
I'm
ever
rude
to
you
again...
What's
wrong
with
your
hand?
Nothing.
The
other
hand.
-
You've
got
to
tell
Dumbledore.
Dumbledore's
got
enough
Anyway
I
don't
want
to
give
Bloody
hell,
Harry.
-
If
the
parents
knew
about
this...
Harry,
you've
got
to
report
this.
-
It's
perfectly
simple.
You're
being...
Hermione,
whatever
this
is,
You
don't
understand.
Then
help
us
to.
Dear
Padfoot...
...I
hope
you're
all
right.
It's
starting
to
get
colder
here.
In
spite
of
being
back
at
Hogwarts,
I
know
you,
of
all
people,
Hello,
Harry
Potter.
-
Your
feet.
Aren
'
t
they
cold?
Unfortunately,
all
my
shoes
I
suspect
Nargles
are
behind
it.
-
What
are
they?
They're
quite
gentle,
really,
but
people
Different.
But
why
can't
the
others
see
them?
They
can
only
be
seen
So
you've
known
someone
My
mum.
She
was
quite
an
extraordinary
witch,
...and
one
day,
-
I
was
9.
Yes,
it
was
rather
horrible.
I
do
feel
very
sad
about
it
sometimes,
We
both
believe
you,
by
the
way.
That
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
back,
...and
the
Ministry
and
the
Prophet
Thanks.
It
seems
you're
about
I
don't
think
that's
true.
But
I
suppose
What
do
you
mean?
Well,
if
I
were
You-Know-Who...
...I'd
want
you
to
feel
cut
off
...because
if
it's
just
you
alone...
...you're
not
as
much
of
a
threat.
-
Do
you
ever
stop
eating?
Harry.
Can
I
join
you?
Pardon
me,
professor,
I
am
merely
requesting
...you
conform
to
the
prescribed
So
silly
of
me,
but
it
sounds...
...as
if
you're
questioning
my
authority
...Minerva.
Not
at
all,
Dolores,
I
am
sorry,
dear.
But
to
question
my
practices
...and
by
extension,
I
am
a
tolerant

...but
the
one
thing
Disloyalty.

duties,
the
Ministry
has
asked
me
to
act
..
..
as
an
informal
observer
here
at
Hogwarts.
Cornelius's
eyes
and
ears
..
as
it
were.
Nothing
whatsoever
to
worry
about.
Please
do
go
on.
I'm
just
a
fly
on
the
wall.
Dream
..
You've
been
in
the
post
...
how
long
exactly?
nearly
...
16
years.
Quite
a
period.
And
it
was
Dumbledore
who
appointed
you?
He
did...
The
interpretation
..
Could
you
please
predict
something
I'm
sorry?
Surely
you're
not
surprised
I
asked.
The
inner
eye
does
not
see
upon
command.
One
teensy
little
prophecy
?
Pity.
Yes,
I
do.
Something
dark.
You
are
in
grave
danger.
Lovely.
Cho.
What's
going
on?
It's
Professor
Trelawney.
Sixteen
years
I've
lived
Hogwarts
is
my
home.
You
can't
do
this.
Actually,
I
can.
Something
you'd
like
to
say?
Oh,
there
are
several
things
There...
Professor
McGonagall,
might
I
ask
you
Sybil,
dear.
This
way.
Thank
you.
Dumbledore,
may
I
remind
you
...of
Educational
Decree
Number
23,
You
have
the
right
You
do
not,
however,
have
the
authority
That
power
remains
For
now.
Don't
you
all
have
studying
to
do?
Professor.
Professor?
Professor
Dumbledore.
Professor!
Professor
Dumbledore.
That
foul,
evil,
old
gargoyle.
We're
not
learning
how
to
defend
ourselves.
She's
taking
over
the
entire
school.
Security
has
been
and
will
remain
Furthermore,
...that
these
disappearances
...of
notorious
Harry.
Sirius.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
You
said
you
were
worried
Training
you
to
kill
half-breeds?
-
Sirius
She's
not
letting
us
use
magic
at
all.
The
latest
intelligence
is
that
Fudge
Combat?
What
does
he
think,
we're
forming
That's
exactly
what
he
thinks.
That
Dumbledore
is
assembling
He's
becoming
more
paranoid
The
others
wouldn't
want
me
...but
things
aren't
going
at
all
well
Fudge
is
blocking
the
truth
...and
these
disappearances
Voldemort
is
on
the
move.
Well,
what
can
we
do?
Someone's
coming.
I'm
sorry
I
can't
be
of
more
help.
But
for
now,
at
least,
He
really
is
out
there,
isn't
he?
We've
got
to
be
able
And
if
Umbridge
refuses
to
teach
us
how,
This
is
mad.
Who'd
wanna
be
taught
by
me?
I'm
a
nutter,
remember?
Look
on
the
bright
side:
-
Thanks,
Ron.
Who's
supposed
to
be
Just
a
couple
of
people.
Lovely
spot.
Thought
it
would
be
safer
Matey,
come
back
here.
Hi.
So
you
all
know
why
we're
here.
We
need
a
teacher.
A
proper
teacher.
One
who's
had
experience
-
Why?
Because
You-Know-Who's
back,
-
So
he
says.
So
Dumbledore
says
because
he
says.
The
point
is,
where's
the
proof?
If
Potter
could
tell
us
more
I'm
not
gonna
talk
about
Cedric,
so
if
Come
on,
Hermione
let's
go.
They're
just
here
because
Harry
wait.
Yes.
I've
seen
it.
Blimey,
Harry.
And
he
killed
a
basilisk,
with
the
sword
It's
true.
Third
year,
he
fought
off
Last
year,
he
really
did
fight
off
Wait.
Look,
it
all
sounds
great
...but
the
truth
is,
I
didn't
know
what
I
was
doing
-
He's
just
being
modest.
Facing
this
stuff
in
real
life
In
school,
if
you
make
a
mistake,
But
out
there...
...when
you're
a
second
away
...or
watching
a
friend
die
You
don't
know
what
that's
like.
You're
right,
Harry,
we
don't.
That's
why
we
need
your
help.
Because
if
we're
going
to
have
...Voldemort...
He's
really
back.
Right.
First
we
need
to
find
...where
Umbridge
won't
find
out.
-
The
Shrieking
Shack.
-
Forbidden
Forest?
Harry,
what
happens
Who
cares?
I
mean,
it's
sort
of
exciting,
isn't
it,
Who
are
you
and
what
have
Anyway,
at
least
we
know
one
What's
that?
Cho
couldn't
take
her
eyes
off
you,
Right.
Over
the
next
few
days,
...with
a
couple
of
possibilities
We've
got
to
make
sure,
wherever
it
is,
Will
do,
Harry.
All
student
organizations
Any
student
in
noncompliance
Watch
where
you're
going,
Longbottom.
You've
done
it,
Neville.
The
what?
It's
also
known
as
The
Room
of
Requirement
only
appears
And
it's
always
equipped
So
say
you
really
needed
the
toilet...
Charming,
Ronald.
It's
brilliant.
It's
like
Hogwarts
Expelliarmus.
I'm
hopeless.
You're
just
flourishing
your
wand
too
much.
You
will
please
copy
...to
ensure
maximum
retention.
-
There
will
be
no
need
to
talk.
-
Expelliarmus.
Stunning
is
one
of
the
most
useful
spells
It's
sort
of
a
wizard's
bread
and
butter,
really.
So
come
on,
then,
Nigel.
Stupefy!
Good.
Not
bad
at
all,
Nigel.
Well
done.
Don't
worry.
I'll
go
easy
on
you.
Thanks,
Ronald.
-
Come
on,
Ron.
-
You
can
do
it.
-
One
Sickle.
Stupefy.
-
Thank
you.
I
let
her
do
that.
It
was
completely
intentional.
Up
you
come.
Now,
focus
on
a
fixed
point
Expelliarmus.
Very
good.
Keep
your
concentration.
Great.
A
little
higher.
I'm
okay.
I'm
okay.
-
Stupefy.
Those
wishing
to
join
the
...may
sign
up
in
the
Diminuendo.
Working
hard
is
important,
but
there's
Believing
in
yourself.
-
Expelliarmus.
Think
of
it
this
way.
Every
great
wizard
in
history
...as
nothing
more
If
they
can
do
it,
why
not
us?
-
Stupefy.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
-
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Fantastic,
Neville.
Well
done,
man.
So
that's
it
for
this
lesson.
Now,
we'
re
not
gonna
be
meeting
again
So
just
keep
practicing
on
your
own
And
..
and
well
done,
everyone.
Well
done,
mate.
Thanks.
See
you
after
Christmas.
See
you
in
the
Common
Room,
Harry.
-
Thanks
a
lot,
Harry.
-
Thank
you
so
much.
-
Thank
you,
Harry.
-
Merry
Christmas.
-
Have
a
great
Christmas,
Luna.
We
could
always
slip
Umbridge
Or
Fever
Fudge.
They
give
you
Sounds
great,
guys.
Are
you
all
right?
I
heard
Umbridge
Yeah.
I'm
okay.
Anyway,
it's
..
it's
worth
it.
It's
just
..
just
learning
all
this...
...makes
me
wonder
whether,
Cedric?
Cedric
did
know
this
stuff.
He
was
really
good.
It's
just,
Voldemort
was
better.
You're
a
really
good
teacher,
Harry.
I've
never
been
able
Mistletoe.
Probably
full
of
Nargles,
though.
What
are
Nargles?
No
idea.
Well,
how
was
it?
Wet.
I
..
I
mean,
she
was
sort
of
crying.
That
bad
at
it,
are
you?
I'm
sure
Harry's
kissing
Cho
spends
half
her
time
You'd
think
a
bit
of
snogging
Don't
you
understand
Well,
obviously
...and
confused
about
liking
Harry
...conflicted
because
Umbridge
is
threatening
to
...and
frightened
of
failing
her
OWLs
One
person
couldn't
feel
all
that.
Just
because
you've
got
Voldemort
may
be
after
something.
Something
he
didn't
have
last
time.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry.
In
the
dream,
...or
looking
down
at
the
scene?
Neither.
It
was
like
I...
Professor
will
you
please
just
tell
me
Everard,
Arthur's
on
guard
duty
tonight.
Make
sure
he's
found
-
Sir.
You
must
go
to
your
portrait
Tell
them
that
Arthur
Weasley
...and
his
children
will
be
arriving
there
They've
got
him,
Albus.
What's
more,
Oh,
thank
goodness.
Next
we
need
to...
Look
at
me!
What's
happening
to
me?
You
wished
to
see
me,
headmaster?
Oh,
Severus.
I'm
afraid
we
can't
wait.
Otherwise,
we'll
all
be
vulnerable.
It
appears
there's
a
connection...
...between
the
Dark
Lord's
mind
Whether
he
is,
as
yet,
aware
of
this
Pray
he
remains
ignorant.
You
mean,
if
he
knows
about
it,
then...
...he'll
be
able
to
read
my
mind?
...unhinge
it.
In
the
past,
it
was
often
...to
invade
the
minds
of
his
victims...
...creating
visions
designed
Only
after
extracting
the
last
exquisite
...only
when
he
had
them
literally
...kill
them.
Used
properly,
...will
help
shield
you
In
these
lessons,
I
will
attempt
You
will
attempt
to
resist.
Prepare
yourself.
Legilimens.
Concentrate,
Potter.
Focus.
Ho,
ho,
ho.
Merry
Christmas.
Here
we
go.
Daddy's
back.
Sit
down,
everybody,
sit
down.
-
And
a
nice
big
box
for
Ron.
Fred
and
George.
Come
on,
open
up.
-
I
want
to
see
your
faces.
-
Try
it
on.
-
Just
what
he
wanted,
actually.
Come
on,
then,
everybody.
Oh,
Harry,
Harry.
There
you
are.
-
Happy
Christmas.
-
Lovely
to
have
you
with
us.
Now,
Daddy.
Pass
that
to
Daddy.
-
Thank
you.
Fred?
George?
-
Hermione.
To
Mr.
Harry
Potter...
...without
whom
I
would
not
be
here.
-
Harry.
Harry.
That
is
delicious.
Daddy,
don't
forget
last
Christmas.
I
can't
understand
I
look
like
a
bloody
idiot,
that's
why.
No
more
than
usual,
Ron.
I
don't
know
why...
Nasty
brat,
standing
there
Harry
Potter,
Friend
of
Mudbloods
-
If
my
poor
mistress
only
knew...
That's
enough
of
your
bile.
Of
course,
master.
Kreacher
lives
to
serve
Sorry
about
that.
He
never
was
very
pleasant,
Not
to
me,
anyway.
What,
you
grew
up
here?
This
is
my
parents'
house.
I
offered
it
to
Dumbledore
About
the
only
useful
thing
This
is
the
Black
family
tree.
My
deranged
cousin.
I
hated
the
lot
of
them.
My
parents
with
their
pure-blood
mania.
My
mother
did
that
after
I
ran
away.
Charming
woman.
I
was
16.
Where
did
you
go?
Round
your
dad's.
I
was
always
welcome
at
the
Potters'.
I
see
him
so
much
in
you,
Harry.
You
are
so
very
much
alike.
I'm
not
so
sure.
Sirius,
when
I
was...
When
I
saw
Mr.
Weasley
attacked,
I
was
the
snake.
And
afterwards,
in
Dumbledore's
office...
...there
was
a
moment
This
connection
What
if
the
reason
for
it
I
..
I
just
feel
so
angry
all
the
time.
And
..
what
if,
after
everything
...something's
gone
wrong
inside
me?
I
want
you
to
listen
to
me
You're
not
a
bad
person.
You're
a
very
good
person
You
understand?
Besides,
the
world
isn't
split
We've
all
got
both
light
and
dark
What
matters
That's
who
we
really
are.
Harry,
time
to
go.
When
all
this
is
over,
You'll
see.
Harry.
Harry.
Hagrid's
back.
I'm
sorry.
I
will
say
this
one
last
time.
I'm
ordering
you
to
tell
me
I
told
you.
I've
been
away
for
me
health.
-
Your
health?
Oh,
yes.
As
gamekeeper,
If
I
were
you,
In
fact,
I
mightn't
bother
This
is
top-secret,
right?
Dumbledore
sent
me
Giants?
You
found
them?
Well,
they're
not
that
hard
to
find,
to
I
tried
to
convince
them
But
I
wasn't
the
only
one
-
Death
Eaters?
Trying
to
persuade
them
-
Did
they?
Suppose
some
of
them
remember
And
they
did
this
to
you?
Not
exactly,
no.
Oh,
go
on,
you
have
it,
then,
It's
changing
out
there.
Just
like
last
time.
There's
a
storm
coming,
Harry.
We'd
all
best
be
ready
when
she
does.
We
have
confirmed
in
the
early
hours
of
yesterday
evening
And
of
course,
the
Muggle
prime
minister
We
strongly
suspect...
...that
the
breakout
was
engineered...
...by
a
man
with
personal
experience
...notorious
mass
murderer
Sirius
Black...
..a
cousin
of
escapee
Dumbledore
warned
Fudge
He's
gonna
get
us
all
killed
Harry.
I
er
..
I
wanted
to
apologize.
Now
even
me
mum
says
the
Prophet's
So,
what
I'm
really
trying
to
say
Neville?
Fourteen
years
ago...
...a
Death
Eater
...used
a
She
tortured
them
for
information...
...but
they
never
gave
in.
I'm
quite
proud
to
be
their
son.
But
I'm
not
sure
We're
gonna
make
them
proud,
Neville.
Make
it
a
powerful
memory,
Allow
it
to
fill
you
up.
George,
your
turn
now.
Expecto
Patronum.
A
full-bodied
Patronus
...but
shield
forms
can
also
be
equally
Wow,
that
was
really
good.
Fantastic,
Ginny.
Just
remember,
your
Patronus
can
only
So
focus,
Luna.
Think
of
the
happiest
thing
you
can.
Expecto
Patronum.
-
I'm
trying
...
This
is
really
advanced
stuff,
guys.
Expecto
Patronum.
I'll
make
short
work
of
this.
Bombarda
Maxima.
Get
them.
Been
watching
them
for
weeks.
And
see,
"Dumbledore's
Army"...
...proof
of
what
I've
been
telling
you
All
your
fear-mongering
...never
fooled
us
for
a
minute.
We
saw
your
lies
for
what
they
were:
A
smokescreen
for
your
bid
Naturally.
No,
professor.
Most
noble
of
you,
Harry,
to
shield
me,
...the
parchment
clearly
says
I
instructed
Harry
And
I,
and
I
alone,
Dispatch
an
owl
to
If
we
hurry,
we
should
still
Dawlish,
Shacklebolt,
...to
Azkaban...
...to
await
trial
I
thought
we
might
hit
this
little
snag.
You
seem
to
be
laboring
What
was
the
phrase?
Come
quietly.
Well,
I
can
tell
you
this:
I
have
no
intention
of
Enough
of
this.
Take
him.
Well,
you
may
not
like
him,
minister...
...but
you
can't
deny...
...Dumbledore
has
got
style.
Boys
and
girls
are
not
permitted
Those
wishing
to
join
Students
will
be
submitted
to
questioning
Any
student
in
noncompliance
Harry.
You
did
everything
you
could.
Even
Dumbledore
Harry,
if
it's
anyone's
fault,
it's
ours.
Yeah,
we
talked
you
into
it.
Yeah,
but
I
agreed.
I
tried
so
hard
to
help,
Anyway,
that
doesn't
matter
anymore.
Because
I
don't
want
to
play
anymore.
And
the
more
you
care,
-
So
maybe
it's
just
better
to...
To
go
it
alone.
Hagrid.
Any
idea
where
he's
taking
us?
Hagrid,
why
can't
you
just
tell
us?
I've
never
seen
the
centaurs
so
riled.
And
they're
dangerous
The
Ministry
restricts
...they
are
gonna
have
a
full
uprising
Hagrid,
what's
going
on?
I'm
sorry
to
be
so
mysterious,
you
three.
I
wouldn't
be
bothering
you
at
all
with
it,
...I'll
likely
be
getting
the
sack
And
I
just
couldn't
leave
Grawpy.
Down
here,
you
great
buffoon.
Grawpy.
Brought
you
some
company.
I
couldn't
just
leave
him,
because...
Because
he's
my
brother.
Blimey.
Well,
half
brother,
really.
He's
completely
harmless,
just
like
I
said.
-
Grawpy,
that
is
not
polite.
We
talked
about
this.
That's
your
new
friend,
Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
Put
me
down.
Now.
You
all
right?
Fine.
Just
needs
a
firm
hand,
is
all.
I
think
you've
got
an
admirer.
You
just
stay
away
from
her,
all
right?
He
gets
his
own
food
and
all.
It's
company
he'll
be
needing
You
will
look
after
him,
won't
you?
I'm
the
only
family
he's
got.
Feeling
sentimental?
-
That's
private.
And
not
to
the
Dark
Lord,
Every
memory
he
has
access
to
You
won't
last
two
seconds
You're
just
like
your
father.
Lazy,
arrogant.
-
Don't
say
a
word
against
my
father.
-
I'm
not
weak.
Control
your
emotions.
Discipline
your
mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I
may
vomit.
Stop
it.
Is
this
what
you
call
control?
We've
been
at
it
for
hours.
The
Dark
Lord
isn't
resting.
You
and
Black,
you're
two

whining
about
Well,
it
may
have
escaped
your
notice,
Your
blessed
father
knew
that.

My

Get

Yeah.
It's
not
as
bad
as
it
seems.
See?
It's
fading
already.
You
can
hardly
see
ours
anymore,
As
I
told
you
once
before,
Mr.
Potter...
...naughty
children
You
know,
George...
...I've
always
felt
our
futures
lay
outside
Fred,
I've
been
thinking
Here
you
go
!
Ready
when
you
are.
I
need
that
prophecy.
You'll
have
to
kill
me.
Oh,
I
will.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry,
are
you
sure?
I
saw
it.
It's
just
like
with
Mr.
Weasley.
It's
the
same
door
I've
been
dreaming
about
for
months.
And
I
couldn't
remember
Sirius
said
Voldemort
Something
he
didn't
have
the
last
time,
Harry,
please,
just
listen.
What
if
Voldemort
What
if
he's
only
hurting
Sirius
What
if
he
is?
Hermione,
What
do
we
do?
We'll
have
to
use
the
Floo
Network.
Umbridge

Not
all
of
them.

you
can.

Are
you

We're
going
with
you.
When
are
you
going
to
get
it
That
you
are.
Caught
this
one
You
were
going
to
Dumbledore,
-
No.

You
sent
for
me,

The
time
has
come
for
answers,
whether
Have
you
brought

I'm
afraid
you've
used

He's
got
Padfoot
at
the
place
Padfoot?
What
is
Padfoot?
What
is
he
talking
about,
Snape?
No
idea.
Very
well.
You
give
me
no
choice,
Potter.
As
this
is
an
issue

leave
me
with...
...no
alternative.

Cruciatus
Curse
That's
illegal.
What
Cornelius
doesn't
know
Tell
her,
Harry!
Tell
me
what?
Well,
if
you
won't
tell
her
where
it
is...
...I
will.
Where

is?

How
much
further?
Not
far.
It
had
to
be
somewhere
What
are
you
doing?
Improvising.
Well?
Where
is
this

There
isn't

there?

here,

Lower
your

I

you,
under

Protego.
How
dare
you?
Filthy

Please.
Please

Now,

Do
you
know

I
am?
Leave

alone.
It's
not

No,

doesn't

something.
I'm
sorry,

They
told

off
That
was
clever,

was
that

We

course.

what

Now,

me
the

If
you
do
anything
to

they're
Now,
let's
everybody
just
calm
down...
All
we
want
is
that
prophecy?
Why
did
Voldemort
You
dare
speak
his
name?
You
filthy
half-blood!
It's
all
right.
Prophecies
can
only
be
retrieved
Which
is
lucky
for
you,
really.
Haven't
you
always
wondered...
...what
was
the
reason
for
the
connection
Why
he
was
unable
to
kill
you...
...when
you
were
just
an
infant?
Don't
you
want
to
know
All
the
answers
are
there,
Potter,
All
you
have
to
do...
...is
give
it
to
me.
Then
I
can
show
you
everything.

waited
14
years.

know.

guess
I
can

longer.

voices.
Can
you
tell
what
they're
saying?
There
aren't
any
voices,
Harry.
Let's
get
out
of
here.
I
hear
them
too.
Harry,
it's
just
an
empty
archway.
Please,
Harry.
Get
behind
me.
Did
you
actually
believe...
...or
were
you
truly
naive
enough
...that
children
stood
a
chance
I'll
make
this
simple
for
you,
Potter.
Give
me
the
prophecy
now...
...or
watch
your
friends
die.
Don't
give
it
to
him,
Harry.
Get
away
from
my
godson.
Now,
listen
to
me.
What?
No,
I'm
staying
with
you.
You've
done
beautifully.
Now,
let
me
take
it
from
here.

Nice
one,
James.

Kedavra.
I
killed
Sirius
Black..

You
coming
to
get
me?
You've
got
to
mean
it,
Harry.
She
killed
him.
She
deserves
it.
You
know
the
spell,
Harry.
Do
it.
So
weak.
It
was
foolish
of
you
The
Aurors
are
on
their
way.
By
which
time
I
shall
be
gone,
and
you...
...shall
be
dead.
You've
lost,
old
man.
Harry.
So
weak.
So
vulnerable.
Look
at
me.
Harry,
it
isn't
how
you
are
alike.
It's
how
you
are
not.
Harry?
You're
the
weak
one...
...and
you'll
never
know
And
I
feel
sorry
for
you.
You're
a
fool,
Harry
Potter.
And
you
will
lose
everything.
He's
back.
The
feast
about
to
start.
-
You
know
I'm
not
hungry
either.
Really
..
I'll
be
okay.
Harry.
Come
here.
Come
on.
I
know
how
you
feel,
Harry.
No,
you
don't.
It's
my
fault.
No,
the
fault
is
mine.
I
knew
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time...
...before
Voldemort
made
I
thought
by
distancing
myself
...he'd
be
less
tempted,
and
therefore
The
prophecy
said:
"Neither
one
can
live
It
means
one
of
us
is
gonna
have
Yes.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
For
the
same
reason
The
same
reason
your
After
all
these
years,
...I
didn't
want
to
cause
you
I
cared
too
much
about
you.
How
come
you're
not
at
the
feast?
Lost
all
my
possessions.
That's
awful.
Oh,
it's
all
good
fun.
But
as
it's
the
last
night,
Do
you
want
any
help
finding
them?
I'm
sorry
about
your
godfather,
Harry.
Are
you
sure
you
don't
want
That's
all
right.
Anyway,
my
mum
always
said...
...the
things
we
lose
have
a
way
If
not
always
in
the
way
we
expect.
Think
I'll
just
go
have
some
pudding.
I've
been
thinking
about
something
What's
that?
That
even
though
...we've
got
one
thing
Yeah?
Something
worth
fighting
for.
