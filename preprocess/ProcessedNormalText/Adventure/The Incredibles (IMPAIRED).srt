You
need
a

Where

You
can't!
It's
impossible!
So
ask
me
now,
Wait.
You
want
to
make
me

Ladies
and
gentlemen,
It's
finally
ready.
You
know,
I
went
through
quite
a

it
wasn't

it
was

And
it's

That

I
only
wanted
to
help!
Fly
home,
Buddy.
I
work
alone.

It
tore
me
apart.
You
can't
count
on
anyone.
Especially
your
heroes.
I
was
wrong
to
treat
you
that
way.
See?
Now
you
respect
me,
That's
the
way
it
works.
There's
a
lot
of
people,
And
they
will
pay
How
do
you
think
I
got
rich?
Now
I
have
a

I
can
defeat.

I
can't

It's
