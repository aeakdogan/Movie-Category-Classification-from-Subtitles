But
it
did
happen.
I
was
just
fourteen
years
of
age
when
a
coward
And
robbed
him
of
his
life,
and
his
horse.

taken
him
up

had
followed

and
lost
all

got
it
into

he
was
being

went
back
to

When

Chaney
fled.
He

No

Chaney
fancied

But
he
was

You

There
is
nothing

Except

Is
that

That
is

If

would

to
kiss
him,
It
would
be

He's
gone

Praise
the

Why
is
it
so
much?
The

of

With

was

was

If

You

I
do
not
entertain
hypotheticals.
Secondly
your

of
the

is

By

two
hundred

anything,
my
purse
is

My

fine
racing
mare.
I've

her

fence
Oh,
it's
all
very
interesting.
The
ponies
are
yours,
take
them.
Your
father's
horse
was
stolen
I
have
provided
reasonable
protection
for
the
creature
My
watchman
had
his
teeth
knocked
out,
I
will
take
it
to
law.
You
have
no
case.
Lawyer
J.
Noble
Daggett
of
Dardanell
Arkansas
May
think
otherwise.
As
might
a
jury.
Petitioned
by
a
widow
and
three
small
children.
I
will
pay
two
hundred
dollars
to
your
fathers
estate.
When
I
have
in
my
hand
absolving
me
of
all
liability
from
the
beginning
I'll
take
two
hundred
dollars
for
Judy,
plus
one
hundred
for
the
ponies.
And
twenty
five
dollars
for
the
grey
horse
He
was
easily
worth,
forty.
That
is
three
hundred
and
twenty
five
dollars,
sold.
The
ponies
have
no
part
in
it.
And
the
price
for
Judy
is
three
hundred
I
would
not
pay
three
hundred
and
twenty
As
for
the
grey
horse,
The
grey
horse
was
lent
to
Tom
Chaney
Chaney
only
had
the
use
of
him.
I
would
pay
two
hundred
and
twenty
five
dollars.
And
keep
the
grey
horse.
I
don't
want
the
ponies.
I
can't
accept
that.
There
will
be
no
settlement
after
I
leave
this
All
right,
this
is
my
last
offer.
Two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars.
For
that
I
get
the
release,
previously
discussed.
And
I
keep
your
father's
saddle.
The
grey
horse
is
not
yours
to
sell.
The
saddle
is
not
for
sale.
I
will
keep
it.
My
Lawyer
Dagget
will
prove
ownership
of
the
grey
horse.
-He
will
come
after
you
with
a
rit
of

-Rit
of

As
I

further.
I
will

the

For
three
hundred
dollars.
Now
you

And
I
do
not
much
care
which
it
is.
My
Lawyer
Daggert
would
not
wish
me
to
consider
But
I
will
settle
for
three
hundred
and
twenty.
If
I
am
given
the
twenty
in
advance.
Now
here's
what
I
have
to
say

In
the
company
of
three
corpses.
I
felt

In

Then,
God
bless
you.
Now

be

We've
had
to

all
the
people
Mrs.
Floyd:
This
was
in
your
poor
father's
room.
That
is
everything.
There
are
no
light

in
this
house.
If
you

something
for

can
give
you
an
empty

arrived?
Rooster:

With

Found

Found
a

twenty

What
became
of
Odus
Wharton?
There
he
sits.
You
may
ask,
Mr.
Goudy.
Goudy:
Thank
you
Mr.
Barlow.
Mr.
Cogburn.
In
your
four
years
as
a
U.S.
Marshall.
How
many
men
have
you
shot?
Never
shot
nobody
that
didn't
ask
for
it.
Well
that
was
not
the
question.
How
many?
Shot
or
killed?
Let
us
restrict
it
to
"killed",
so
that
About
twelve.
Fifteen
stopping
men
in
flight,
Around
twelve
he
says.
Or
fifteen.
So
many,
you
cannot
keep
Goudy:
I
have
examined
the
records,
and
can
Uhh...
I
believe
them
two
Wharton
boys
And
how
many
members
of
this
one
family,
the
Wharton

have
you

And
Clete
Wharton,
half
brother.
Well
Clete
was
selling
ardent
spirits
to
the
Cherokee.
Goudy:
A
King
bolt?
You
are
armed,
and
he
advanced
upon
you.
With
nothing
more
than
a
king
bolt?
From
a
wagon
tongue?
I've
seen
men
badly
torn
up
with
nothing
Goudy:
Returning
to
the
other
encounter.
With
Aaron
Wharton,
and
his
two
remaining
sons.
You
sprang
from
cover.
With
revolver
in
hand.
-Rooster:
That'd
be
it.
Well
if
it
ain't
loaded
Goudy:
And
like
his
son,
Aaron
Wharton
Well
he
was
armed,
he
had
an
axe
raised.
I
believe
you
testified
you
backed
away
-That's
right.
I
always
go
backwards,
when
I'm
backing
up.
Very
amusing.
Goudy:
Now
he
advanced
on
you
much
Menacing
you
with
that
little
ol'
King
bolt,
Yes
sir,
he
commit
to
cussin'
and
-Laying
about
a
threat.
How
many
steps
before
the
shooting
started?
Uh,
seven
to
eight
steps.
Goudy:
Good,
Aaron
Wharton
keeping
pace.
Advancing
away
from
his
campfire.
Seven,
eight,
steps.
What
would
that
be?
Fifteen,
twenty
feet?
I
suppose.
Will
you
explain
to
this
jury,
Mr.
Cogburn.
Why
Mr.
Wharton
was
found
immediately
by
his
Goudy:
His
sleeve
and
hand
smoldering.
Did
you
move
the
body
after
you
shot
him?
Why
would
I
do
that?
You
did
not
drag
the
body
over
to
-No,
sir.
Who
arrived
on
the
scene
will
testify
Goudy:
You
do
not
remember
moving
the
body.
So
it
was,
a
cold
blooded
bushwhack,
Barlow:
Objection.
If
that's
where
the
body
was,
I
do
not
remember.
Goudy:
Why,
would
you
move
the
body,
Mr.
Cogburn?
Them
hogs,
moving
around,
I'd
do
not
remember.
Rooster

Speak

I
saw
your
mother
yesterday
morning.
She
said
for
you
to
come
right
on
home.
What
was
your
business
there?

This
is
a
man
I
think
you
know.
You
called
him,
Tom
Chaney.
I
believe.
Though
in
the
months
I've
been
tracking
John
Todd
Anderson,
and
others.
He
dallied
in
Monroe,
Louisiana,
and
Before

up
at
your

Then
why
did
you
not
catch
him
at,
He
is
a
crafty
one.
I
thought
him
slow
witted
myself.
That
was
his
act.
It
was
a
good
one.
Are
you
some
kind
of
law?
That's
right
I'm
a
Texas
Ranger.
That
may
make
you
a
big
noise

Why
have
you
been
ineffectually
pursuing
Chaney?
He
shot
and
killed
a
state
senator
Bibb's
family
put
out
a
reward.
How
came
Chaney
to
shoot
a
state
senator?
My
understanding
is
there
was
an
argument
about
a
dog.
You
know
anything
about

No,

It'll
be

I
presume,

want

I
want

to

Well,
you
can
let
him

You
can

Rooster:
HEY!
Go
on.
You
stay
here,

And
I'm
going
to
see
Bagby.

Has
Chaney
been
here?
Rooster:
No.
Coke
Hayes
was,
two
days
ago.
Coke
rides
with
Lucky
Ned.
He
brought
supplies
with
this.
Well
this
is

piece.
Tom

here
we
come.
Not
the

only

piece.
They
are
rare
here.
They
are
rare.
But
if
it
is,
Chaney's.
It
could
just
as
easily
mean
that
Lucky
Ned
and
his
gang
fell
upon
him
as
he
fell
in
with
them.
Chaney
could
be
a
corpse.
That
would
be
a
bitter
disappointment
Um,
pursue
them.
Ned's
unfinished
business
for
the
Marshall's
anyhow.
Or
we
can
know
the
whereabouts
Bagby
didn't
know
which
way
they
went.
But
now
that
we
know
they
come
through
here.
They
couldn't
have
gone
but
one
of
two
ways.
Heading
north,
towards
the
Winding
Stair
Mountains.
Or
pushing
further
west.
I
expect
north,
there
is
more
to
rob.
I
found
an
eating
place,
called
the
'Green
frog'.
Started
calling
myself,
Burroughs.
But
my
drinking
picked
up.
My
wife
did
not
care
for
the
company
She
decided
to
go
back
to
her
first
husband.
A
clerk
in
a
hardware
store.
That
was
when
she
said,

I
told
her,

Nola.
Hope
that

bastard
She
took
my
boy
with
her
too.
He
never
cared
for
me
anyway.
I
guess
I
did
speak
awful
rough
to
him.
I
did
not
mean
anything
by
it.
I've
never
seen
a
clumsier
child
than,
Horace.
I
bet
he
broke

it,

I
would
not
recognize

mostly

I
believe
not.
Well,
cut
him
down.
Why?

Chaney's
taken
into
custody.
Mattie:
Help
me.
MATTIE!
Mattie:
Marshall.
Man:
Take
them
horses
you
got,
and
move.
Tom,
get
up
on
that
hill,
don't
you
stop.
What's
down
there?
Marshall
Cogburn
and
fifty
more
officers.
You
tell
me
another
lie
and
I'll
Just
the
Marshall.
Rooster.

Cogburn!
You
hear
me?
You
answer
me,
Rooster.
I
will
kill
this
girl.
You
know
I
will
do
it.
Rooster:
The
girl
is
nothing
to
me,
That
is
all
very
well.
Do
you
advise
that
I
kill
her?
Rooster:
Do
what
you
think
is
best,
Ned.
She's
nothing
to
me
but
a
lost
child.
Rooster:
Think
it
over,
first.
I
have
already
thought
it
over.
You'll
get
mounted
double
fast.
If
I
see
you
riding
over
I
will
spare
the
girl.
You
have
five
minutes.
Rooster:
They
will
be
a
party
Let
me
have
the
girl
and
Chaney
Too
thin,
Rooster.
Too
thin.
Your
five
minutes
is
running.
No
more
talk.
Run
up
that
hill.



Farrell,
see
to
Tom's
wound.
Can
I
have
some
of
that
bacon?
You
can
help
yourself.
They'll
soon
be
coffee.
I
do
not
drink
Coffee,
I
am
fourteen.
Well
we
do
not
have
buttermilk,
We
are
poorly
supplied.
-Where
is
she?
I
aught
to
ring
your
scrawny
neck.
You
let
that
go.
What
happened,
huh?
I
will
tell
you,
and
you
will
see
that
Tom
Chaney
there
shot
my
father
to
death,
at
Fort
Smith
and
robbed
him
of..
two
gold
pieces
and
stole
his
mare.
I
was
informed
that
Mr.
Cogburn
had
grit,
and
Moments
ago
I
came
upon
Chaney
watering
the
horses.
Mattie:
He
would
not
be
taken
in
charge
and
I
shot
him.
If
I
had
killed
him
I
would
not
now
That
will
do
it.
It
will
embarrass
you
every
time.
Most
girls
like
to
play
pretties,
I
do
not
care
a
thing
in
the
world
about
guns.
I
was
shot
in
an
ambush,
Ned.
The
Horses
were
blowing
and
making
noise,
it
was
that
officer
that
got
me.
How
can
you
sit
there
and
tell
such
a
big
story?
That
pit
is
a
hundred
feet
deep,
and
leave
you
to
scream
and
rot.
-How
do
you
like
that?
This
man
will
not
let
you
have
your
way.
He's
your
boss
Aw,
nothings
going
my
way.
Was
that
Rooster
that
waylaid
us
It
was
Marshall
Cogburn
and
myself.
You
and,
Cogburn.
Quite
the
posse.

Doctor:
Let
us
move,
Ned.
In
good
time,
Doctor.
What
happened
to
Quincy,
and
the
kid?
They
are
both
dead.
I
was
in
the
very
middle
of
it,
Doctor:
Please,
let
us
move,
Ned.
Doctor:
The
Marshall's
gone.
Do
you
need
a
good
lawyer?
I
need
a
good
judge.
What
happened
to
Coke
Hayes?
The
old
fellow
shot
off
his
horse.
Dead
as
well.
His
depredations
have
come
to
an
end.
Your
friend
Rooster
does
He
is
not
my
friend.
He
has
abandoned
me
to
a
congress
of
louts.
You
do
not
varnish
your
opinion.
Doctor:
Are
we
off?
Let
us
cut
up
the
winnings
from
the
Katy
Flyer.
They'll
be
time
for
that
at
the
old
place.
I
will
mount
the
grey.
I
have
other
plans
for
you.
Must
I
double
mount
with
the
doctor?
-Doctor:
No.
it
will
be
too
chancy
with
two
You
will
wait
here
with
the
girl.
When
we
reach
Ma's
house
I'll
send
Carroll
back
here
with
some
fresh
mounts.
We'll
be
out
by
dark.
We'll
meet
you
at
the
old
place.
Chaney:
I
do
not
like
that.
Let
me
ride
with
you,
Ned.
I
was
short
a
horse.
The
Marshalls
will
come
swarming.
Hours,
if
they
come
here
at
all.
They'll
think
that
we've
all
gone.
Mattie:
I
am
not
staying
here
That's
the
way
I
will
have
it.
Mattie:
He
will
kill
me.
You
heard
him
say
it.
He's
killed
my
father,
He
will
do
no
such
thing.
Tom,
you
know
the
crossing
at
the
cypress
forks
Lucky
Ned:
When
your
mounted,
you
take
Ned:
You
understand,
Tom?
Any
harm
comes
to
that
child,
you'll
not
get
paid.
Harold,
let
me
ride
up
with
you.

I
am
not
heavy.
Ned:
Do
the
calf
again,
Harold.
Mooooo.
Everything
is
against
me.
You
have
no
reason
to
whine.
You
act
as
the
bandit
Chief
instructed
you
will
get
your
winnings
at
the
old
place.
Lucky
Ned
has
left
me
alone.
I
am
sure
Chaney:
Must
think
over
my
position
Where's
the
second
California
gold
piece?
What
have
you
done
with
Papa's
mare?
Keep
still.
Are
you
thinking
about
the
old
place?
Look
here,
if
you
let
me
go.
I
will
swear
to
an
affidavit...
and
once
you
are
brought
to
justice,
I
tell
you
I
can
do
better.
I
don't
need
no
affidavit.
All
I
need
is
your
silence.
Your
father
was
a
busybody
like
you.
In
honesty,
I
do
not
regret
He
thought
Tom
Chaney
was
small.
You
and
him.
You
will
give
me
an
affidavit.
You're
all
against
me,
everybody....

La
Boeuf:
That
is,
Chelmsford.
Strange
to
be
so
close
to
him
at
last.
Mr.
La
Boeuf,
how
is
it
that
you
are
here?
I
heard
a
shot.
Went
down
to
the
river.
Cogburn
outlined
a
plan.
Mind
your
foot,
there's
a
pit
there.
His
part,
I
fear
is
rash.
La
Boeuf:
He
returns
for
Lucky
Ned.
Well,
Rooster!
Will
you
give
us
the
road?
One
against
four,
it
is
ill
advised.
La
Boeuf:
He
would
not
be
dissuaded.
Rooster:
Hello
Ned,
how
many
men
is
with
the
girl?
Lucky
Ned:
Just
Chaney.
Our
agreement
is
in
force.
She
was
in
excellent
health,
Farrel,
I
want
you
and
your
brother
You
as
well,
Doctor.
Have
no
interest
in
you
today.
What
is
your
intention,
Rooster?
You
think
one
on
four
is
a
dog
fall?
I
mean
to
kill
you
in
one
minute,
Ned.
Rooster:
Or
see
you
hanged
at
Fort
Smith
Which
will
you
have?
I
call
that,
bold
talk.
From
a
one-eyed
fat
man.
(Harold
clucks
like
chicken,
then
Fill
your
hand,
you
son
of
a
bitch.

them
Mr.
La
Boeuf.
To
far,

to

Well,
Rooster?
I'm
shot
to
pieces.

at

Stand
up,

Chaney.
M...Mr.
La
Boeuf
Are
you
alive?


Mr.
La
Boeuf!

Mr.
La
Boeuf.
Mr.
La
Boeuf.
Rooster:
Are
you
there?
Mattie:
I'm
here.
Rooster:
Can
you
clamber
out?
I
cannot.
There
are
snakes.
Rooster:
They
awake?
Mattie:
Not
yet.


I'm
bit.
Does
Mr.
La
Boeuf
survive?
He
does.
Even
a
blow
to
the
head
Where
you
bit?
Look
away,
Mattie.
I
have
her.
Up
with
us.
Rooster:
Here
Mr.
La
Boeuf,
take
her.
She's
snake
bit.
Rooster:
We
are
off.
I'll
send
help
for
you
as
soon
as
I
can.
Don't
wander
off.
We
are
not
leaving
him.
I
must
get
you
to
a
Doctor,
Sis.
I'm
your
debt
for
that
shot,
pard.
Never
doubt
the
Texas
Ranger.
Come
on.
Ever
stalwart.



Mattie
sobs:
We
must
stop.
Little
Blackie
is
played
out.
We've
miles
yet.
Come
on
you.
NO!
No.
That's
it,
come
on
now.
Mattie:
No,
stop.
He's
getting
away.
Who's
getting,
sis?
Chaney.


Mattie
cries:
No..
NO!
Mattie
shouts:
NO,
no,
no.
Sobs:
Oh,
no.
No,
stop.



I've
grown
old.



By
the
time
we
reached
Bagby's
store,
my
hand
had
turned
black.
I
was
not
awake
when
I
lost
the
arm.
The
Marshall
had
stayed
with
me,
I
was
told.
until
I
was
out
of
danger.
But
he
departed
before
I
came
around.
Once
home.
I
wrote
him
with
an
invitation,
to
come
by,
the
next
time
he
found
And
collect
the
fifty
dollars
I
still
owed
him.
I
did
not
hear
back
from
Marshall
Cogburn.
And
he
did
not
appear.
Then
one
day
I
received
a
note
from
He
said
he
was
traveling
with
the
Wild
West
show.
Getting
older
and
fatter.
Would
I
like
to
come
visit
him
and
swap
stories
with
an
old
trail
mate.
He
would
understand
if
the
journey
were
to
long.
Brief
though
his
note
was.
It
was
rife
with
misspellings.
Yes'm?
I
am,
Cole
Younger.
Cole
Younger:
This
is
Mr.
James.
It
grieves
me
to
tell
you
that
you
have
missed,
Rooster.
He
passed
away
three
days
ago.
Cole
Younger:
When
the
show
was
at
Jonesboro,
Arkansas.
Buried
him
there
at
a
Confederate
cemetery.
Ruben
had
a
complaint
what
he
referred
to
as,
And
I
believe
the
warm
weather
was
to
much
for
him.
We
had
some
lively
times.
What
was
the
nature
of
your
acquaintance?
I
knew
the
Marshall
long
ago.
We
too
had,
lively
times.
Thank
you,
Mr.
Younger.
Keep
your
seat,
trash.
Mattie
Narrates:
I
had
the
body
removed
to
No
doubt
people
talk
about
that.
They
say,
"Well,
she
hardly
knew
the
man".
"Isn't
she
a
cranky
old
maid".
It
is
true,
I
have
not
married.
I
never
had
time
to
fool
with
it.
I
heard
nothing
more
of
the
Texas
If
he
is
yet
alive.
I
would
be
pleased
I
judge
he
would
be
in
his
seventies
now.
And
nearer
eighty
than
seventy.
I
expect
some
of
the
starch
has
gone

just
gets
away
from
us.
