My

rose
for
Yeah,
one.
Hold
on
to
your
card.
And
quit
whining.
It's
an
adventure.
Wait.
Did
I
take
the
wrong
turn?
This
can't
be
right.
-
Look,
there's
our
house.

Oh,
you're
right.
This
road
should
get
us
there.

Don't
take
a
shortcut.
-
Trust
me.
It's
gonna
work.
-
They
look
like
little
houses.
Some
people
think

Dad,
I
think
we're
lost.

-

What's
that?
-
What's
this
old
building?
Honey,
get
back
in
the
car.
Chihiro.
Oh,

heaven's
sake.
This
building's
not

It's
fake.
These
stones

What
is
it?
I'm
not
going.
Don't

Let's
just
take
a
look.
It's
all
right.
They've
got
the
keys.

All
right.
Just
a
quick
look.
Come
on,
you
guys.
Come

honey.
It'll
be
fun.
I'm
not

Chihiro,
just
wait
in
the
car
then.

-

Everybody,
watch
your
step.
Chihiro,
don't
cling
like
that.
What
is
this
place?
-
Oh,
do
you
hear
that?

-
It
sounds
like
a
train.
Come
on.
Let's
go
check
it
out.

-
What
are
those
weird
buildings?
It's
an
abandoned
theme
park.
See?
They
built
them
Then
the
economy
went
bad,
This
must
be
one
of
them.
Where
are
you
going?
Now
let's
go
back.

Hey!


Did
you
hear
that
building?
It's
just
the
wind.
Oh,
what

beautiful
place.
We
should
have
brought

looks
delicious.
Anybody?
Don't
worry,
honey.
We
can
pay
the
bill
Good
plan.
Hey,
that
looks
great.
I
wonder
what
this
is
called.
Oh,
it's
delicious.

I
don't
want
any.
We're
gonna

Come
on,
you
guys.
You

That's
weird.




There's
the
train.

You
shouldn't
be

What?
Leave,
before
it
gets
dark.

They're
lighting
the
lamps.
You've
gotta

up
with

a
dream.
Away.
Disappear.

I'm

Looking
forward
to
a
relaxing
time.

I
hope

is
what
you
have
to
do.
They
did
turn
into
pigs.
Don't
worry.

Go
all
the
way
down
the
stairs
where
they
stoke
the
fires.
There
you'll
find
Kamajii,
Kamajii?
Tell
him
you
want
to
work
here.
Even
if
he
refuses,
you
must
insist.
If
you
don't
get
a
job,
Yubaba.
Huh?
You'll
see.
She's
the
witch
who
Kamajii
will
try
to
turn
you
away

just
keep
asking
for
work.
It'll
be
hard
work,

Then,
even
Yubaba
can't
harm
you.

have
to

did

it.
No

He's
following
us.

Step
out
to
the
right,
I
don't
think
they're
big
enough.
Your
rooms
are
right
this
way.

Hmm.
Rin?

What's
that
smell?
-
It's
human.
You

pathetic
little
girl

Well,
come
in.
-
I
said,
come
in.


Quiet
down.

Excuse
me.
I
was
wondering
-


I
don't
want
to
hear
You're
just
a
stinking,
And
this
is
certainly
It's
a
bathhouse
for
the
spirits.
It's
where
they
come
And
you
humans
Like
your
parents,
who
gobbled
up
They
got
what
they
deserved,
Hmm.
You
could
be
a
piglet.
Or,
maybe
you'd
prefer


I
can
see
you
shaking.
Actually,
But
I'm
sure
Let's
thank
whoever
helped
you.
Just
who
was
it,
dear?
-

-
Don't
start
that
again.

Why
in
world
do
you
think
Anyone
can
see
you're
and
you
have
no
manners.
This
is
a
high-class
place
So
there's
no
job
for
you.
-

and
work
you
until
you
breathe...
your
very
last
breath.

-

Oh,
dear,
Mommy's
here.
Why
are
you
still
here?
I
want
you
to
give
me
a
job,
please!
Quiet
down!
You're
scaring
the
baby.

Ooh!
Hi,
sweetie.
Don't
be
angry.

I'm
not
leaving

Okay.
Okay.
Just
be
quiet.
Here
comes
Mommy.

That's
your
contract.
Sign
your
name
away,
If
I
hear
one
little
you'll
be
joining
So
I...
Just
sign
it.
-
I
can't
believe
I
took
that
oath.
Give
a
job
to
anyone
who
asks.
Ridiculous.
I
hate
being
Are
you
done
yet?
-
So,
your
name's
Chihiro.
What
a
pretty
name.
And
it
belongs
to
me
now.
From
now
on,
your
name
is
Sen.
-
Answer
me,
Sen!
You
called
for
me?
This
girl
signed
a
contract.
Right.
What's
your
name?
What?
Chih...
Oh.
It's
Sen.
Okay,
Sen.
Follow
me.
Haku,
uh...
Don't
talk
to
me,

-
I
don't
care
if
Yubaba
-
She's
already
under
contract.
-
I
promise
to
work
very
hard.
-
She'll
stink
up
the
whole
place.
Three
days
of
eating
our
food,
If
she
doesn't
work
hard,
roast
her,
Now
get
back
to
work.
What?
Don't
you
dump
her
on
me.
-
You
said
you
wanted
an
assistant.
-
Give
the
girl
to
Rin.
-
Sen,
get
going.
Why
are
you
picking
on
me?
-
Have
a
nice
day.
Come
on.
I
can't
believe
you
pulled
it
off.
-
Huh?
Now,
keep
on
your
toes,
-
Okay.
I
don't
feel
so
good.
So,
this
is
our
room.
A
little
food
and
some
sleep
Here's
your
apron.
You
have
to
You're
so
puny.
Way
too
big.
-
Rin,
you
know
Haku?
There
aren't
two
of
him
Two
Hakus?
He's
Yubaba's
henchman.

-
Let's
see.
Ah,
here
we
go.
Are
you
feeling
okay?
Quiet
down.
What's
your
problem?
It's
the
new
girl.



Meet
me
at
the
bridge.
-


-
My
shoes
are
gone.
-
Huh?
Thank
you.

-

We
don't
have
much
time.
-

I
understand.

Mom,
Dad,
are
you
all
right?
Mom!
Dad!
What's
wrong
with
them?
No.
They
ate
too
much.
They
don't
remember
So
look
hard.
It's
up
to
you
Don't
you
worry,
I
promise
So
just
don't
get
any
fatter
Here
are
your
clothes.
Hide
them.
-
I
thought
they'd
been
thrown
away.
My
good-bye
card's
still
here.
Chihiro.
Chihiro.
That's
how
Yubaba
controls
you...
So
hold
on
to
that
card.
While
you're
here,
I
can't
believe
I
forgot
my
name.
If
you
completely
forget
it,
I've
tried
everything
You
can't
remember
your
name?
No.
But
for
some
reason,
Here
you
go.
Eat
this.
-
No.
Just
eat
it.

Have
some
more.
You'll
be
all
right.

I've
got
to
go
now.
-
Just
stay
out
of
trouble.

Haku.
He's
a
dragon?

Huh?

-
Where
were
you,
Sen?

-


-

haven't
you
ever
worked
-
Rin
and
Sen,
you
get
the
big
tub
today.
-
Hey,
that's
frog
work.
Hello.
Aren't
you
-

Sen,
hurry
up.
I'll
leave
the
door
open
for
you.
-
Heard
you
got
the
big
tub,
Rin.
Those
jerks.
They
haven't
cleaned

-

We
only
use
this
tub
Disgusting.
This
sludge
is
so
caked
on,
Rin,
Sen,
you've
got
Wait!
Give
us
a
minute.
We'll
have
to
soak
it
off.
Get
an
herbal
A
what?
-
An
herbal
soak
token.
Hey,
Rin,
what's
a
foreman?
Hmm.
Something's
coming.
What
useless
scum

I
can't
waste
a
token
on
you.
Enjoy.
Have
a
nice
bath.
-
For
the
radish
spirit.
Why
are
you
still
standing
here?
I'm
not
giving
you
a
token.
-
I
said
scrub
it
yourself.
Well,
that's
too
bad.
Mugwort
bath?

-
Hmm?
Foreman
speaking.
Oh,
yes.
What?
-
Thank
you
very
much.
-
Hey!
Wait
a
minute.
-
Nothing.
Everything's
fine.
-
Is
it
a
human?
Wow,
Sen.
You
got
a
really
good
one.
Clip
this
on,
then
let
go.
It
goes
straight
to
Kamajii,
You
pull
on
this
to
start
-
Uh,
you're
such
a
klutz.
Dried
worm
salt.
And
with
water
this
murky,

You
can
let
go
of
the
rope
now.
Okay.
Ow!
Uh,
sir.
-
There's
so
many.
-
What?
They're
all
for
me?
Thanks,
but
I
don't
need
any
more.
-
Uh...


-
Oh,
Yubaba.
-
And
apparently,

We're
closed.
-
Go!
Please,
go.
Leave
us.
Hmm.
Something's
fishy.
But
we
have
no
choice.
Just
give
him
a
bath
and
get
him
Everybody
go
back
to
your
rooms.
-
Don't
worry
about
a
thing.
-
Yes,
sir.
Take
this
guest
to
the
big
tub
-
But-But,
I...
-
You
hear
me?

-

Hands
down.
You'll
insult
our
guest.

Look
about
you,
customer.

-
Sen,
take
the
nice
customer's
money.

Don't
make
him
wait.
This
way.
-

-
Get
out
of
my
way!

Our
food!
Open
your
windows,
all
of
them!




What?
Just
a
minute,
sir.


-
I
don't
think
it's
very
funny.
Look.
She
wants
to
refill
the
tub.
Oh,
dear!
She's
gonna
waste
Ow!

Hmm.
Who
gave
her
Don't
look
at
me.
I
didn't
do
it.

Oh,
no!
That's
our
best
Sen!
Sen,
where
are
you?
Over
here!
Don't
worry.
You're
gonna
be
fine.
I
think
he
needs
help.
It
feels
like
-
A
thorn?
What's
that?
-
Get
the
staff
down
there.
Step
on
it!
Right,
right,
right!

All
of
you!
That's
no
stink
spirit

Grab
onto
this
rope.

Mmm.
Hold
on
tight.

Hurry
up,
now.
Everyone

got
it
tied
on!
Everyone,
ready
on
my
command.
And...

And

And
heave!
A
bicycle?
Thought
so.
Get
ready,
now!
-
Heave!
Heave!




Sen!
Sen,
where
are
you?
Well
done.
Huh?

-
Gold!
Hey,
wait!

Stop!

Our
guest
is
still
here,
you
idiots!

Sen,
you're
in
our
guest's
way.
-
Yes,
ma'am.



Sen,
you
did
great!
That
spirit
is
rich
and
powerful.
-
Sake's
on
the
house
tonight.
-
But
first,
hand
over
-
That's
not
fair!

-
I
swiped
a
dumpling
for
you.
What
a
day.
Mmm.
-
Rin,
have
you
seen
Haku?
He
just
disappears
sometimes.
Rumor
has
it
he
runs
around
-
Does
he
really?
Fine.
There's
so
much
water.
What'd
you
expect
I've
gotta
get
out
of
this
place.
Mmm.

-


Ah!
Hmm.
Huh?
It's
gold!
Huh?
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
The
bath's
closed.
Ooh!
Oh!
More
gold!
Are
you...
Are
you...

Ahh.
Uh,
gimme!
Ahh.

What's
going
on
in
there?
It's
way
past
bedtime.
Come
on!
-

Wh...
Hey,
boss,
up
here.
-
And
I
want
you
to
serve
me.
Here,
I'll
pay
you
up
front.
And...
I
wanna
take
a
bath
too.
Why
don't
you
wake
everyone
up?
Mom,
Dad,
I
got
a
gift
Maybe
if
you
eat
it,

Which
ones
are
you?
Mom,
Dad!


Rin?
Where
is
everybody?
Wow.
It
really
is
a
sea.
There's
Mom
and
Dad's
pigpen.
I
sure
hope
they're
doing
Kamajii
lit
the
boiler
already?
How
long
was
I
asleep?
-
Hurry
up!
Come
on,
he's
starving!
Serve
everything
you've
got,
-
Hey,
Sen.
I
was
just
coming
It's
real
gold.
He's
giving
gold
away

Just
keep
the
food
coming.
Hmm.
Who
is
the
guest?
Oh,
who
cares?
Come
on,
I'm
going
to
go
look
for
Haku.
Oh!
Would
you
quit
-
Come
on,
Sen.
Let's
go
get
some
gold.
-
Let's
go
get
some
more!


He
better
get
here
before
I
forget
I
sure
hope
Dad
hasn't
gotten
too
fat.
Hmm?
Haku?
It's
Haku!
He's
back!
Are
birds
chasing
him?
Haku!
Fight
'em!
Come
on!

Haku,
this
way!
Aah!

Huh?
It's
just
paper.
Haku,
you're
bleeding.
Hold
still.
-

He
went
in
that
top
window.

Welcome
the
rich
man
#
His
butt
keeps
getting
bigger


#
Beg
for
tips

Beg
for
tips
Give
me
some
dough!
I'll
do
anything
for
you!
-

-
Going
upstairs.
Huh?
Aah!
Blood!
Get
out
of
the
way!
Thank
you
for
helping
me
earlier.
-
Don't
talk
to
him,
you
stinking
hum...



I
don't
want
any,
but
thanks.
I'm
sorry,

-
Hey,
there!
Hey!
Everybody,
out!
Oh,
I'm
terribly
sorry,
sir.
You'll
have
to
excuse
the
little
girl.
-
Wipe
that
smile
off
your
face.
-
You're
still
smiling.




Aah!

Huh?
It's
Yubaba!



I
found
out
who
He's
a
No-Face!
You
attract
terrible
guests.
Don't
let
him
eat
anyone
else

Haku
is
bleeding
Get
him
out
of
here.


-
Ahh.
Hi,
sweetie.

Oh,
I
woke
you,
I'm
sorry.

Go
back
to
sleep,
now.

Ow!
Let
go
of
me!
Wow,
you're
a
big
baby.
-
I'm
in
a
really
big
hurry.
-
Huh?
I'm
not
a
germ,
I'm
a
human.
Now,
would
you
please
let
go
of
me?
You'll
get
sick
if
you
go
outside.
So
stay
here
and
play
with
me.
-
You
won't
get
sick.
That's
why
I've
never
left
this
room.
Staying
in
this
room
Listen,
someone
very
important
I've
got
to
go
right
now,
If
you
go
I'll
cry,
and
Mama
will
come
in
here
and
kill
you.
-
Play
with
me,
or
I'll
break
your
arm.
Please!
I'll
play
with
you
later,
okay?
-
No,
I
wanna
play
now!
-


Haku!
What
are
you
doing?
Get
away!
-
Can
you
hear
me?
-
Shut
your
mouth!
Haku!
-

Stop
it!

I'm
not
afraid
of
germs.
Please
don't
cry.
Just
wait.
Right
now,
or
I'll
start
crying.

Don't
cry!
Don't
cry!
What
a
spoiled
brat!
Shut
your
big
mouth!
You're
a
bit
of
a
porker,
aren't
you?
-
Hmm.
Still
see-through.
You
pea-brain.
Can't
you
even
tell
me
There,
now.
Your
body
Let's
see.

-

This
is
our
little
secret.
You
tell
anyone
else,
-
Who
are
you?
It
was
nice
of
you
to
lead
me
Now,
hand
him
over
to
me.
What
do
you
want
with
Haku?
Too
bad.
He
stole
my
solid
gold
seal.
It's
magic
and
powerful,
Haku
wouldn't
steal.
Huh!
Do
you
know
why
he
became
To
steal
her
magic
secrets,
He's
a
greedy
little
thief.
Step
aside,
little
girl.
There's
a
spell
on
the
seal,
-
No,
you
can't!
You
idiots!
What's
your
problem?
Keep
quiet.
I
don't
want
my
sister
Ow.
A
paper
cut.
Haku,
we're
falling!
Haku!


-
What's
going
on
here?
Are
you
okay?
Haku!

-
What's
wrong
with
you?
This
looks
serious.
Haku,
don't
give
up!
It
looks
like
he's
bleeding
-
From
the
inside?
Haku,
I
got
this
gift
Eat
it.
Maybe
it'll
help.
Come
on!
Open
your
mouth!
Please,
Haku!
Eat
it!
See?
It's
okay.
Medicine
from
the
river
spirit.
Open
your
mouth.
That's
it.
Got
it.
-
Now
swallow.
-
Sen,
look
there!
-
The
gold
seal!
Get
it!




You
killed
it?
Hurry,
before
it
rubs
off
on
you!
Put
your
thumbs
-
Evil,
be
gone!
Zaneba's
solid
gold
That's
as
powerful
as
it
gets.
Look!
He's
changed
back.
Help
me.
What
do
we
do?

-
Haku!
Haku,
wake
up!
Zaneba
put
a
curse
on
the
seal.
That's
strong
magic.
That
should
make
him
Poor
Haku.
He's
had
it
He
just
showed
up
But
he
got
mixed
up
with
Yubaba.
I
warned
him
it
was
too
dangerous.
Go
back
home,
"I
told
him.
But
he
said
for
some
reason
Once
Yubaba
his
face
turned
pale
-
He's
never
been
the
same.
Kamajii,
what
if
I
take
I
could
give
back
the
seal
Can
you
tell
me
You'd
go
to
Zaneba's?
-
It
might
help,
but
she's
Haku
helped
me
before.
Hmm.
I
know
how
you
can
get
there,
Wait
here.
Let's
see,
now.
I
know
it's
Everyone,
I
need
my
shoes
I
guess
my
parents
will
have
to
wait.
Sen!
I've
looked
everywhere
for
you.
-
Rin!
What's
going
on
here?
I
picked
up
some
new
friends.
See?
-
Everyone's
looking
for
you.
The
guy
with
all
the
gold
And
he
says
that
you
I
did
let
him
in.

Yeah.
I
thought
he
was
a
customer.
What?
He's
a
monster.
Found
it!
Here
it
is,
Sen.
-
Hey,
we're
busy,
boiler
man.
You've
got
train
tickets?
I've
been
saving
them
Now,
listen
carefully.
The
train
stop
-
Swamp
Bottom?
-
The
sixth
stop.
Make
sure
you
get
it
right.
but
these
days
it's
a
one-way
ride.
Still
want
to
go?
Yep.
I'll
walk
back
along
the
tracks.
-
Sen,
what
about
No-Face?
Haku,
I'll
be
back
soon.
What's
going
on?
Something
you
wouldn't
recognize.


-
He
just
keeps
getting
bigger!
-
I
don't
wanna
be
eaten
by
it.

Oh,
Sen,
thank
goodness.


-
I'm
sure
they'll
find
Sen
somewhere.

Hurry!
This
way!
-
Madam,
Sen
is
here
now.
Sen
has
arrived,
sir.
She'll
be
-
He's
destroying
everything.
So
suck
up
to
him
and
get
every
last

Ew!
What's
that
dirty
mouse
doing
here?
Huh?
He's
your...
Familiar?
Don't
be
stupid.
Here's
Sen.
Will
Sen
be
all
right
-
You
wanna
take
her
place?
Hmph!
Try
this.
It's
delicious.
Want
some
gold?
I'm
not
giving
it
Come
closer,
Sen.
Just
name
it.
I
would
like
to
leave,
sir.
I
have
someplace
You
should
go
back
Yubaba
doesn't
want
you
Where
is
your
home?
No.
No!
I'm
lonely.
What
is
it
that
you
want?
I
want
Sen.
Take
the
gold.
Take
it!
-
Are
you
going
to
eat
me?
-

-
Huh.
-

If
you
want
to
eat
me,
I
was
saving
this
for
my
parents...
but
I
think
you'd
better
have
it.


-
Sen!
Sen,
what
did
you
do
to
me?
Aah!

Enough!
I
don't
care
if
he's
rich!
This
nonsense
has
gotta
stop!

Over
here!

Run
for
your
life!



-

Now,
that's
an
esophagus!

I'll
get
you
for
this,
Sen!
Duck!

Excuse
me.
Sen,
this
way!
Hey,
over
here!
Sen,
don't
call
him
over!
I
think
being
in
the
bathhouse
He
needs
to
get
out
of
there.
-
Yeah?
And
go
where?
You
don't
know?
Great.


Hmm?
-
You'll
have
to
walk
from
here.
The
station's
just
down
the
tracks.
Thanks,
Rin.
-
You
better
come
back,
you
hear
me?
Sen,
I'm
sorry
I
called
you
No-Face,
if
you
put
even
one
scratch
There's
the
station.
Here
comes
the
train.
Come
on.
Oh.
We'd
like
to
go
Huh?
-
Oh.
You
wanna
come
with
us?
He'd
like
to
come
too,
please.
Uh...
Uh...
Sit
here.
Behave
yourself,
okay?


-
Kamajii,
wake
up.
-
Haku,
you're
all
right.
Did
she
go
somewhere?
You
blacked
out,
remember?
Yeah,
I
remember
being
in
darkness.
Then
I
could
hear
Sen's
voice
So
I
followed
her
voice,
I
was
lying
here
Pure
love.
It
broke
Zaneba's
spell.
Sen
left
to
return
the
golden
seal.
She
did
it
to
save
you.

to
covering
the
damage
Sen
didn't
get
nearly
enough.
-
Madam,
you
see,
Sen
was
the
one
So
what?
And
now
she's
run
away
from
here.
She's
even
abandoned
-
Those
pigs
must
be
ready
-
Turn
them
into
bacon.
-
Huh?
You're
still
alive?
You
still
haven't
noticed
that
something
Don't
get
fresh
with
me,
young
man.
Since
when
do
you
talk




My
baby!
No!

-
My
baby!
Where's
my
baby?
Where
are
you,
sweetie?
Come
out!
Please,
come
out!
Where
are
you?
Sweetie!

Where
is
he?
What
did
you
do
with
my
baby?
He's
with
your
sister.
Zaneba?
Uh...


Very
clever,
Haku.
I
get
it.
You'll
get
my
baby
back
for
me,

Tear
up
Sen's
contract.
And
then
I
want
you
to
return
Fine,
but
on
one
condition.
I
get
to
give
Sen
one
final
test.
If
she
fails,
she's
mine.
I
hope
this
is
the
right
stop.
Let's
go.



You
can
ride
on
my
shoulder
Hmm?


Hello?
Hurry
up.
I
don't
have
all
day.
Come
on.
-
So,
you
all
made
it.
Sit
down.
I'll
make
some
tea.
Excuse
me,
ma'am.
Haku
stole
this
I
see.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
this
is?
Yes.
It's
the
golden
seal
I'm
here
to
apologize
for
Haku.
He
sliced
me
in
two,
you
know,
-
What?
I'm
sorry.
You
mean
that
black
slug
I
think
I
squashed
it
with
my
foot.
Squashed
it?

That
wasn't
my
slug.
My
sister
put
that
slug
into
Haku
You
squashed
it.
What
happened
to
my
spell?
Only
love
can
break
it.
Can
you
please
turn
these
two
The
spell
on
those
two
Change
back
if
you
want.

I
don't
get
along
with
my
sister.
She's
so
obnoxious.
You
saw
how
tacky
her
home
is.
-
We're
identical
twins,
I'm
sorry
she
turned
But
there's
nothing
I
can
do.
You'll
have
to
help
your
parents
Use
what
you
remember
What?
Can't
you
please
It
seems
like
I
met
Haku
before,
That's
a
good
start.
Once
you've
met
someone,
It
just
takes
a
while
While
you're
thinking,
the
boys
And
I
want
you

-
Ah,
come
on.
Keep
at
it.
No-Face,
where
did
you
Now
let's
weave
Knit
one,
pearl
two.
Knit
one...
That's
right.
Granny,
I
can't
remember
Haku
could
be
dead
already,
My
mom
and
dad
could've
Wait
just
a
little
bit
longer.
Ahh.
There
we
go.
Use
it
to
tie
back
your
hair.
It's
beautiful.
It'll
protect
you.
It's
made
from
the
threads
Thank
you.

What
good
timing.
-
Will
you
let
him
in?
-

Haku!
Haku.
Thank
goodness.
You're
alive!
I
can't
believe
it.
Ahh.
That's
love
for
you.
Look,
Granny.
Haku's
alive.
-
Haku,
I
will
forgive
you
But
in
return,
Okay,
you
two,
Come
back
soon.
No-Face,
-
I
could
use
a
good
helper.
Granny!
Thank
you
so
much.
I'll
miss
you.
Don't
worry.
You'll
be
all
right,
Sen.
I
want
you
to
know
my
real
name.
Chihiro.
What
a
pretty
name.
-
You
take
good
care
of
it.
-
Off
you
go.
Granny,
take
care!
Haku,
listen.
I
just
remembered
something
Once,
when
I
was
little,
And
when
I
tried
I
thought
I'd
drown,
but
the
water
It
finally
came
back
to
me.
The
river's
name
was
I
think
that
was
you,

You
did
it,
Chihiro!
I
remember.
I
was
the
spirit
of
the
Kalaku
River.
-
A
river
spirit?
They
filled
in
that
river.
That
must
be
why
I
can't
I
remember
you
falling
into
my
river,
So
you're
the
one
who
carried
me
back
You
saved
me.
-
Hey,
there
they
are!
I
see
you
failed
-

-
Mama!
Are
you
traumatized?
You're
standing
all
by
yourself.
Don't
forget
your
promise.
You
must
return
Chihiro
Hmph!
Not
so
fast,
Haku.
I
get
to
give
Sen
one
final
test.
-

Stop
it,
Mama.
Leave
her
alone.
-

But
a
deal
is
a
deal,
sweetie.
I
have
to
give
Sen
one
final
test.
If
you
make
Sen
cry,
-
But...
Granny?
You're
right.
A
deal's
a
deal.
Okay,
I'm
ready.
I'll
take
your
test.
Hmm.
You've
got
guts.
I've
got
your
contract
right
here.
This'll
only
take
a
minute.
Don't
worry.

See
if
you
can
tell
which
of
these
pigs

You
get
one
try.
If
you
get
it
right,

Huh?
There
must
be
a
mistake.
None
of
these
pigs
None
of
them?
-
Mm-hmm.


Thank
you,
everyone.
All
right,
you
win.
Thanks
for
everything,
Granny.
Good-bye!
-

Good-bye!
-
Haku!
-
Where
are
my
mom
and
dad?
they
woke
up
They're
there
now,
There's
no
water
here.
-
I
can
walk
across
now.
Just
go
back
the
way
you
came.
But
you
have
to
promise
not
to
What
about
you?
What'll
you
do?
Don't
worry.
I'll
go
back
I'll
tell
her
I'm
going
I'm
fine.
I
got
my
name
back.
-
Will
we
meet
again
sometime?
-
Promise?
Now
go,
and
don't
look
back.
-

Chihiro!
Where
have
you
been?
Mom,
Dad!
-
You
shouldn't
run
off
like
that,
honey.
Are
you
guys
sure
you're
all
right?

Let's
go.
Chihiro,
hurry
up.
Everybody,
watch
your
step.
Chihiro,
don't
cling
like
that.

We
made
it.
What
is
it?
Look
at
that.
-
It's
all
dusty
inside
too.
-
Looks
like
it.



Come
on,
Chihiro.

Don't
be
afraid,
honey.


A
new
home
and
a
new
school?
