Do
not
panic.
We
are
trained
professionals.
We
are
going
around
the

A-Around
the
leaf
?
Oh,

This
is
nothing

You're
doing
great
!
Watch
my
eyes.

And
here's
the
line
again.

Oh,

Shouldn't

tell
the
queen
?
She's
got
enough
on
her
plate
already,
Oh,
yes.
Oh,
wind's
died
down.
-
Just
be
confident,
dear.
There's
a
gap
in
the
line.
It's
okay,
Your
Highness.
Gaps
happen.
Oh.
Right.
Your
Highness,
I
can't
count
Oh,
of

Oh,
it'll
be
fine.
They
come,
they
eat,

leave.
It's
not
a
lot,
but
it's
our
life.

Isn't

right,
Aphie
?

Ditch
Dot

me.
I'm
sorry

This
is
my
new
idea

You

Thanks.
You
can
keep

I
like
your

I'm
beginning
to
think
Great.
One
success.

I'm
never
gonna
make

I'm
a

Pretend--
pretend
-
It's

rock.
But
let's
just
pretend
for
a
minute
it's
Now,
do
you
see
our
tree
?
Everything
that
made
is
already
contained
All
it
needs
is
some
time,
a
little
bit
voila
!
This
rock
will
be
a
tree
?
Seed
to
tree.
You've
gotta
You
might
not
feel
but
that's
just
because,
You
just
have
to
give
yourself
But
it's
a
rock.
I
know
it's
a
rock
!
Don't
ya
think
I
know
a
rock
You're
weird,
but
I
like
you.


They're
here.

They're
coming

Dot

Food
to
the
offering
stone

movin',
keep
movin'
!
Okay.
That's

Excuse
me,
pardon
me.
Sorry.
Coming

Princess
Atta,

Not
now,
Flik.
Shh
!
-

Yeah,
where's
the
food
?

-
What
did
you
do
?

Boo
!
-
Where's
the
food
?
-
Hopper.
So,
where
is
it
?
Where's
my
food
?
-
I-l-Isn't
it
up
there
?
-
The
food
was
in
a
leaf
Are
you
sure
-
Are
you
saying
I'm
stupid
?
Do
I
look
stupid...
to
you
?
Let's
just
think
about
the
logic,
If
it
was
up
there,
to
your
level,
-
Uh,
l--
You're
not
the
queen.
Sh-She's
learning
Oh,
I
see.
Under
new
management.
No,
it
wasn't
me,
it
was--
Uh-uh-uh.
First
rule
of
leadership:
-
But-But
l--
one
of
those
circle-of-life
Now,
let
me
tell
you
The
sun
grows
the
food,
the
grasshoppers
eat
the
food--
And
the
birds
eat
the
grasshoppers.
Hey,
like
the
one
that
nearly
ate
you,
This
blue
jay
has
And
I'm
scared.
Aw,
come
on.
I
swear,
if
I
hadn't
promised
that
I
wouldn't
kill
you,
-
And
believe
me,
no
one
I
don't
want
to
hear
another
word
-
Do
you
understand
me
?
-
I
said,
do
you
understand
me
?
-
Remember
Ma
!
Hey,
I'm
a
compassionate
insect.
There's
still
a
few
months
so
you
can
all
just
try
again.
But,
Hopper,
since
it's
we
need
this
time
Listen,
if
you
don't
then
I
can't
guarantee
your
safety.
And
there
are
insects
out
there
Someone
could
get
hurt.



What's
the
matter
?

-
Dot
!
-

You
want
her
?
No
?
It
seems
to
me
that
you
ants
So
let's
double
-

We'll
be
back
when
the
last
leaf
falls.
You
ants
have
a
nice
summer.
-
Yee-ha
!


Flik,
what
do
you
have
Sorry.
I--
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
mean
for
things
I
especially
didn't
want
-
Well,
Flik,
ya
did.
-
Then
help
us--
don't
help
us.
Flik,
you
are
sentenced
to
Excuse
me,
Your
Highness.
Helpers
to
help
us.
It
took
two
days
to
dig
him
out.
Heavens,
no
!
We
could
leave
the
island,
We
could
!
We
could
go
-
It's
perfect
!
Your
Highness,
don't
you
see
?
-

Why
didn't
I
think
of
that
?
-She's
right!
We
never
leave
the
island.
There's
snakes
and
birds
Exactly
!
Bigger
bugs
!
We
could
find
bigger
bugs
and
forever
rid
us
-
Ludicrous!
-
I'll
volunteer.
You
got
a
lot
of
spunk,
kid,
At
least
we
could
try.
I
could
travel
If
you
went,
you'd
be
Royal
huddle.

Great
idea,
Princess.
It's
perfect
!

Wait
a
minute.
While
we
keep
harvesting

Flik
gone,

much
deliberation,
we
have

makin'
a

of

You
should
tell
Hopper.
But,
you
know,
You're
his
brother.
the
vice
president
of
the

Wow

Good
!
I've
been
thinkin'--
which
is
somethin'
This
is
a
thought,
and
it
was
mine:
-
You
don't
even
like
grain.
You're
right.
I
didn't
think
It
wasn't
even
my
idea.
They
talked
fancy
to
me.
-

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Guys,
order
another
round...
because
we're
stayin'
here
!
-

What
was
I
thinking
?
I
mean,
we
just
got
here,
and
we
have
more
than
enough
food
Right
?
Why
go
back
?

But
there
was
that
ant
-
Yeah,
but
we
can
forget
about
him
!
-

Ooo-oooh
!
Yeah,
you're
right
!
-
Yeah,
boss.
They're
puny
!
Say,
let's
pretend
this
grain
-
Didn't
that
hurt
?
-
Well,
how
'bout
this
one
?
-


You
let
one
ant
stand
up
to
us,
then
they
all
might
stand
up.
Those
puny
little
ants
And
if
they
ever
figure
that
out,
It's
not
about
food.
That's
why
we're
going
back
!

anybody
else
wanna
stay
