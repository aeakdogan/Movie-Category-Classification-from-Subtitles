Onward,
Chauncey!
To
the
highest
room
...where
my
princess
awaits
rescue
This
is
worse
than
"Love
Letters".
Me,
too.
Whoa
there,
Chauncey!
Hark!
The
brave
Prince
Charming
Fear
not,
fair
maiden.
I
shall
slay
...then
take
my
place
as
rightful
king.
What
did
she
say?
It's
Shrek!
Whoo,
Shrek,
yeah!
Prepare,
foul
beast...
...to
enter
into
a
world
of
pain
Happy
birthday
to
thee
Do
you
mind?
Do
you
mind?
Boring!
Prepare,
foul
beast...
Someday
you'll
be
sorry.
We
already
are!
Mommy...
You're
right.
I
can't
let
this
happen.
I
can't!
I
am
the
rightful
King
of
Far
Far
Away.
And
I
promise
you
this,
Mother...
...I
will
restore
dignity
to
my
throne.
And
this
time,
no
one
will
stand
in
my
way.
Good
morning.
Good
morning.
Morning
breath.
I
know.
Isn't
it
wonderful?
Good
morning,
good
morning
The
sun
is
shining
through
Good
morning,
good
morning
And
you!
They
grow
up
so
fast.
Not
fast
enough.
You'll
be
filling
in
Several
functions
Great!
Let's
get
started.
Come
on,
lazybones.
Time
to
get
moving!
You
need
to
get
a
pair
of
jammies.
I
got
some
sleep
and
I
needed
it
Not
a
lot,
just
a
little
bit
Someone's
always
It's
a
crying
shame
It's
a
royal
pain
in
the
neck
I
knight
thee.
If
you're
filling
in
for
a
king,
Can
somebody
come
in
I
will
see
what
I
can
do.
Yeah,
wow.
Is
this
really
necessary?
Quite
necessary,
Fiona.
-
I'm
Shrek,
you
twit.
This
isn't
a
rehearsal,
peoples.
Smiles,
everyone!
Smiles!
I
don't
know
how
much
longer
I'm
sorry,
but
can
you
It's
just
until
Dad
gets
better.
Shrek?
You
look
handsome.
Come
here,
you.
My
butt
is
itching
up
a
storm
and
Hey,
you!
Come
here.
What's
your
name?
Fiddlesworth,
sir.
Perfect.
Ladies
and
gentlemen...
...Princess
Fiona
and
Sir
Shrek!
Ahh!
You've
got
it.
A
little
to
the
left.
That's
it!
That's
good.
Oh,
yeah!
Scratch
Shrek!
My
eye!
What
are
you
doing?
Fiona!
-
Are
you
okay?
Shrimp!
My
favorite!
-
That's
it!
We're
leaving!
Calm
down?
Who
do
you
think
I'm
not
cut
out
for
this,
Fiona,
I
think
that
went
well.
Donkey!
Come
on,
Shrek!
Some
people
just
don't
Just
think.
A
couple
more
days
...in
our
vermin-filled
shack
...and
filled
with
the
stench
You
had
me
at
"vermin-filled".
And,
um...
maybe
even
the
pitter-patter
That's
right,
the
swamp
rats
Uh,
no.
What
I'm
thinking
of
is
a
little
bigger
Donkey?
No,
Shrek.
What
if,
theoretically...
...they
were
little
ogre
feet?
Honey,
let's
be
rational
about
this.
Have
you
seen
a
baby
lately?
They
just
eat
and
poop,
and
they
cry...
...then
they
cry
when
they
poop
Now,
imagine
an
ogre
baby.
They
extra-cry
and
they
extra-poop.
Shrek,
don't
you
ever
think
Right
now,
you're
my
family.
Somebody
better
be
dying.
I'm
dying.
Harold?
Don't
forget
Of
course,
darling.
Fiona.
Yes,
Daddy?
I
know
I
made
many
mistakes
with
you.
It's
okay.
But
your
love
for
Shrek
has...
...taught
me
much.
My
dear
boy...
...
I
am
proud
to
call
you
my
son.
And
I'm
proud
to
call
you
my
frog...
...King
dad-in-law.
Now
there
is
a
matter
The
Frog
King...
is
dead.
Put
your
hat
back
on,
fool.
Shrek...
...please
come
hither.
Yeah,
Dad?
This
kingdom
needs
a
new
king.
You
and
Fiona
Next
in
line.
You
see,
Dad,
Even
on
your
deathbed,
Come
on,
Dad.
An
ogre
as
king?
That's
not
such
a
good
idea.
There
must
be
somebody
else.
Anybody!
Aside
from
you,
there
is
Really?
Who
is
he,
Dad?
His
name
is...
...is...
What's
his
name?
...is...
Daddy!
His
name
is
Arthur.
Arthur?
I
know
you'll
do...
...what's
right.
Harold?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad?
Do
your
thing,
man.
When
you
were
young
and
your
heart
Was
an
open
book
You
used
to
say
live
and
let
live
You
know
you
did,
you
know
you
did
But
if
this
ever
changing
world
Makes
you
give
in
and
cry
Say
live
and
let
die
Live
and
let
die
Hey,
lady
Cursing
at
your
life
You're
a
discontented
mother
And
a
regimented
wife
What
does
a
prince
Ah,
Mabel!
Why
they
call
you
an
ugly
stepsister,
Where's
Doris?
Taking
the
night
off?
She's
not
welcome
here,
What
do
you
want,
Charming?
Not
much.
Just
a
chance
at
redemption.
And
a
Fuzzy
Navel.
And
Fuzzy
Navels
for
all
my
friends!
We're
not
your
friends.
You
don't
belong
here.
You're
absolutely
right,
Do
a
number
on
his
face.
Wait,
wait,
wait!
Wicked
Witch!
The
Seven
Dwarfs
Oh,
what's
it
to
you?
They
left
you
the
unfairest
of
them
all.
Now
here
you
are,
How
does
that
feel?
Pretty
unfair.
And
you!
Your
star
puppet
abandons
the
show
I
hate
that
little
wooden
puppet.
And
Hook.
Need
I
say
more?
-
And
you,
Frumpypigskin!
Where's
that
firstborn
Mabel.
Remember
how
you
...into
that
tiny
glass
slipper?
Cinderella
is
...eating
bonbons,
cavorting
with
...that
has
ever
done
you
wrong!
Once
upon
a
time,
someone
decided
But
there
are
...and
our
side
has
not
been
told!
So
who
will
join
me?
Who
wants
Who
wants
their...
..."happily
ever
after"?
This
way,
gents.
It's
out
of
my
hands,
senorita.
The
But
I
will
never
forget
you.
As
are
you.
And,
uh,
you.
I
don't
know
you,
but
I'd
like
to.
I
got
to
go!
I
don't
wanna
leave
you
either.
But
you
know
how
Shrek
is.
But
don't
worry.
I'll
send
you
Be
strong,
babies.
Coco,
Peanut,
listen
to
your
mama.
Bananas,
no
roasting
marshmallows
That's
my
special
boy!
Come
here,
all
of
you!
Shrek?
Maybe
you
should
just
stay
and
be
King.
Come
on.
There's
no
way
That's
why
your
cousin
Arthur
It's
not
that.
You
see...
And
if
he
gives
me
trouble,
Here's
persuasion...
and
here's
reason.
Fiona...
...soon
it's
just
going
to
be
you,
me...
...and
our
swamp.
It's
not
going
to
be
just
you
and
me.
All
aboard!
It
will
be.
I
promise.
I
love
you.
That's
lovely.
Bye-bye,
babies!
Shrek!
-
Wait!
I'm...
I'm...
I
love
you,
too,
honey!
No!
I
said
I'm...
You're
what?
I
said
I'm
pregnant!
What
was
that?
You're
going
to
be
a
father!
That's
great!
Really?
I'm
glad
you
think
so!
I
love
you!
Yeah!
Me,
too!
You!
I'm
going
to
be
an
uncle!
And
you,
my
friend,
are
royally...
Home.
Shrek!
Fiona!
Fiona?
Oh,
no.
Better
out
than
in,
I
always
say.
No,
no,
no!
It's
okay.
It's
gonna
be
all
right.
Stop!
Hey,
wait!
Donkey.
Donkey!
Wake
up!
Dada!
Shrek!
Are
you
okay?
I
can't
believe
I'm
going
to
be
Allow
me
to
explain.
When
a
man
...a
powerful
urge
sweeps
over
him.
I
know
how
it
happened.
I
just
can't
believe
it.
How
does
it
happen?
And
the
cat's
in
the
cradle
Little
Boy
Blue
and
the
Man
in
the
Moon
When
you
coming
home,
son?
But
we'll
get
together
then,
Dad.
Donkey!
Can
you
just
cut
to
the
part
where
you're
supposed
You
know
I
love
Fiona,
boss.
Right?
What
I
am
talking
about
...an
ice
cold
pitcher
of
mojitos
Don't
listen
to
him!
Having
a
baby
It's
not
my
life
I'm
worried
When
have
you
ever
heard
the
phrase
...or
"as
nurturing
as
an
ogre"...
...or
"You'll
love
Okay.
I
get
it.
It's
not
going
to
be
easy.
That's
true.
I'm
doomed.
You'll
be
fine.
You're
finished.
Uh,
with
your
journey.
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"?
It's
Worcestershire.
Like
the
sauce?
It's
spicy!
They
must
be
expecting
us.
What
in
the
shista-shire
Well,
my
stomach
aches
and
my
palms
High
school?
Ready?
Okay!
Wherefore
art
thou
headed,
to
the
top?
Yeah,
we
think
so,
we
think
so!
And
Nay,
we
thinkst
not,
we
thinkst
not!
All
right,
Mr.
Percival,
For
lo,
bro,
don't
burn
I'm
feeling
nauseous
from
memories
How
did
you
receive
wedgies
when
you
are
Let's
just
say
some
things
So
I
was
all
like,
"I'd
rather
get
-
Oh,
totally.
-
Totally
ew-eth.
I
just
altered
my
character
level
Hi.
We're
looking
for
someone
named...
Who
rolled
a
+9
dork
spell
and
I
know
you're
busy
not
fitting
in,
but
He's
over
there.
There
is
no
sweeter
taste
Strong,
handsome,
face
of
a
leader.
Does
Arthur
look
like
a
king
or
what?
Sorry.
Did
you
say
you
were
looking
for
Arthur?
That
information
is
It's
top
secret!
Now,
gentlemen,
let's
away.
Greetings,
Your
Majesty.
This
is
your
lucky
day.
What
are
you
supposed
to
be?
Some
kind
of
giant
mutant
leprechaun
Giant
mutant...
You
made
a
funny.
Unhand
me,
monster!
Stop
squirming,
Arthur.
I'm
not
Arthur.
I
am
Lancelot.
That
dork
over
there
is
Arthur.
This
is,
like,
totally
embarrassing...
...but
Tiffany
thinkest
She
thought
perchance
thou
would
Excuse
me?
Like,
whatever.
She's
into
college
guys
Oh,
Arthur...
...come
out,
come
out,
wherever
you
are!
You
better
run,
The
days
of
Donkey
Dumpy
Drawers
Hold
it.
We're
here
for
the
mascot
contest.
We're
here
for
the
mascot
contest,
too.
This
is
a
costume?
Worked
on
it
all
night
long.
Looks
pretty
real
to
me.
If
he
were
real,
could
I
do
this?
Or
this?
If
it
were
real,
that
would
have
been
-
Now
watch
this!
Thank
you
to
Professor
Primbottom
...on
"just
say
nay".
And
now,
without
further
ado,
let's
give
...to
the
winner
...ogre?
That's
right.
I'm
the
new
mascot.
So
let's
really
try
and
beat
...whatever
it
is
they're
doing!
This
is
all
a
bit
unorthodox...
Where
can
I
find
Arthur
Pendragon?
Hey,
wait...
Classic.
You
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself!
I
didn't
do
it.
They
did.
Please
don't
eat
me.
Eat
him!
Eat
him!
Eat
him!
I'm
not
here
to
eat
him!
Time
to
pack
up
You're
the
new
King
of
Far
Far
Away.
What?
Artie
a
king?
Burn.
Is
this
for
real?
Absolutely.
Clean
out
your
locker,
kid.
So,
wait...I'm
really
the
only
heir?
The
one
and
only.
Give
me
a
second.
My
good
people...
...there's
a
lesson
here
for
all
of
us.
Next
time
you're
about
to
dunk
a
kid's
"Hey,
maybe
this
guy
has
feelings.
Maybe
I
should
cut
him
some
slack.
'Cause
maybe...
just
maybe...
...this
guy's
gonna
turn
out
to
be,
Maybe
his
first
royal
decree
will
be
to
I'm
looking
at
you,
jousting
team!
And
Guin?
Oh,
Guin.
I've
always
loved
you.
Good
friends,
it
breaks
my
heart,
but...
...enjoy
your
stay
here
in
prison
Okay,
let's
not
overdo
it.
I'm
building
my
city,
people...
You
just
overdid
it.
Look
at
you!
You
look
darling.
Just
precious.
Look
at
her.
Any
cravings
since
you
got
pregnant?
No.
Not
at
all.
Do
you
smell
ham?
It's
present
time!
Fiona,
please
open
mine
first.
"Congratulations
on
your
new
"Hopefully
this
helps.
-
Look
at
that!
It's
for
the
poopies.
Wait...
babies
poop?
Everyone
poops,
Beauty.
Fiona!
We
all
chipped
in
Ta-da!
You
know
the
baby
will
love
it,
Guys,
that's
so
sweet.
Thank
you.
Who's
this
one
from?
I
got
you
the
biggest
one,
"Have
one
on
me.
Love,
Snow
White."
What
is
it?
He's
a
live-in
babysitter.
Where's
the
baby?
You're
too
kind,
Snow,
It's
nothing.
I
have
six
more
at
home.
-
What
does
he
do?
-
Feeding.
So,
what
are
Work
on
your
marriage.
Thanks,
Rapunzel.
Come
on
now,
Fiona.
You're
tired
all
the
time.
You
start
letting
yourself
go.
Stretch
marks.
Say
goodbye
to
romance.
I'm
sorry,
but
how
many
She's
right!
A
baby
will
only
strengthen
the
love
How
did
Shrek
react
when
you
told
him?
When
he
first
found
out,
Shrek
said...
Onward,
my
new
friends!
Now...
bombs
away!
Well,
well,
well.
If
it
isn't
Peter
Pan.
-
His
name's
not
Peter.
Enough
pillaging!
To
the
castle!
You
go!
Take
care
of
the
baby!
Everybody
stay
calm!
We're
going
to
die!
Everyone
in!
Now!
Come
on!
Put
some
back
into
it!
We
don't
have
time.
Now
go!
Quickly,
ladies!
We'll
hold
them
off
as
long
as
we
can!
Where
are
Shrek
and
Fiona?
The
name
doesn't
ring
a
bell.
No
bell.
I
suggest
you
freaks
cooperate...
...with
the
new
King
of
Far
Far
Away!
The
only
thing
you're
ever
gonna
-
Hook!
Avast,
ye
cookie.
Start
talking.
-
Gingy!
Settle
down
now.
On
the
good
ship
Lollipop
It's
a
sweet
trip
to
the
candy
shop
You!
You
can't
lie.
So
tell
me,
puppet...
where
is
Shrek?
Well...
I
don't
know
where
he's
not.
You
don't
know
where
Shrek
is?
It
wouldn't
be
inaccurate
to
assume...
...that
I
couldn't
exactly
not
say
that
So
you
do
know
where
he
is!
On
the
contrary,
not
definitely
rejecting
the
idea
that
in
no
way,
Stop
it!
...I
do
not
know
where
he
shouldn't
be.
If
that
indeed
wasn't
where
he
isn't.
Even
if
he
wasn't
not
where
On
the
good
ship
Lollipop
Enough!
Shrek
went
off
He's
bringing
back
the
next
heir?
No!
Hook!
Get
rid
of
this
new
"King".
But
bring
Shrek
to
me.
I
have
something
special
He'll
never
fall
for
your
tricks!
Oh,
boy.
I
can't
believe
it.
Me,
a
king?
I
knew
I
came
from
royalty,
but...
...I
figured
everyone
forgot
about
me.
Oh,
no.
In
fact
the
King
Really?
Wow.
But
I
know
it's
not
all
fun
and
games.
It
really
is
Sure,
you
have
to
knight
a
few
heroes,
By
the
way,
make
sure
you
hit
the
boat
Any
idiot
can
hit
a
boat
with
a
bottle.
Well,
I've
heard
This
is
going
to
be
huge.
Parties,
princesses,
You'll
be
living
in
the
lap
of
luxury.
The
finest
chefs
And
fortunately,
What
do
they
do?
Taste
the
food
before
the
King
eats,
-
Poisoned?
Don't
worry.
Your
bodyguards
All
of
them
willing
to
lay
down
their
lives
Really?
The
whole
kingdom
will
look
Make
sure
they
don't
die
of
famine!
-
Or
plague.
The
coughing,
the
groaning,
Festering
sores!
What
did
I
say?
We
don't
want
Artie
Artie?
There
goes
my
hip!
Artie!
What
are
you
doing?
What
does
it
look
like?!
This
really
isn't
up
to
you.
I
don't
know
anything
about
being
king!
You'll
learn
on
the
job!
Sorry,
but
I'm
going
back.
Back
to
what?
Being
a
loser?
Now
look
what
you
did!
Look
what
I
did?
Shrek!
Land
ho!
How
humiliating.
Oh,
nice
going,
Your
Highness.
Now
it's
"Your
Highness"?
If
you
think
this
is
getting
you
We're
heading
back
to
Far
Far
Away
...and
you're
going
to
be
a
father!
What?
You
just
said
"father".
King!
You're
going
to
be
king!
"You're
going
to
be
king!"
Yeah,
right.
Where
are
you
going?
Far
Far
Away...
from
you!
Get
back
here,
young
man!
Boss?
I
don't
think
he's
coming
back.
Maybe
it's
for
the
best.
When
did
you
plan
to
tell
him
Come
on.
Why
would
I
do
that?
Besides,
he'll
be
ten
times
Then
change
your
tactics
You're
right,
Donkey.
What
about
this?
-
Shrek!
Still...
Listen,
Artie.
If
you
think
this
whole
mad
scene
I'm
not
trying
to
get
up
in
your
grill
But
what
I
am
screamin'
is,
yo...
...check
out
this
If
it
doesn't
groove,
or
what
I'm
saying
ain't
straight
trippin',
You're
getting
on
my
last
nerve."
And
then
I'll
know
it's...
Help!
I've
been
kidnapped
by
a
monster
-
Artie,
wait.
Greetings,
cosmic
children
Welcome
to
my
serenity
circle.
Please
leave
any
bad
vibes
Now
prepare
to...
I
knew
I
should
have
got
that
warranty!
Mr.
Merlin?
You
know
this
guy?
Yeah.
He
was
the
school
magic
teacher,
Technically,
I
was
merely
a
victim
At
the
request
of
my
therapist,
and
the
school
authorities,
I
retired
to
discover
my
divine
purpose.
Can
I
interest
anyone
Uh,
no.
Sure
you
don't
want
to
try
It's
organic.
Thanks.
I
ate
a
boulder
on
the
way
in.
We
need
directions
to
Far
Far
Away.
"We"?
Who
said
I
was
going
with
you?
I
did.
People
are
counting
on
you,
If
the
job's
so
great,
you
do
it.
Understand
this,
kid.
No
more
That
was
your
Mr.
Nice
Guy?
Yeah,
and
I'm
going
to
miss
him.
Why
don't
you
go
terrorize
a
village
Was
that
a
crack
about
ogres?
You
get
...before
I
kick
it
there!
I
could
tell
you,
but
since
you're
in
the
midst
it
would
be
karmically
irresponsible.
Self-destructive...?
Most
definitely,
but
only
after
you
take
the
journey
to
your
soul!
I
don't
think
so.
It's
either
that
All
right.
Journey
to
the
soul.
Now,
all
of
you,
Iook
into
the
Fire
of
Truth
and
tell
me
what
you
see.
Ooh,
charades!
Okay,
I
see
a
Dutch
fudge
torte
Okay,
monster...
go
for
it.
I
see
a
rainbow
pony.
Excellent
work!
Now
the
boy.
This
is
lame.
You're
lame!
Now
just
go
for
it.
Okay.
There's
a
baby
bird
and
a
father
bird
Yes!
Stay
with
it!
The
dad
just
flew
away.
Why
did
It's
trying
to
fly,
It's
going
to
fall!
Proper
head
case
you
are.
Okay,
I
get
it.
The
bird's
me.
Look,
Artie,
um...
Just
thought
I'd
help
set
the
mood...
...for
your
big
heart-to-heart
chat.
I
know
what
it's
like
Even
ogres
get
scared.
You
know...
once
in
a
while.
I
know
you
want
me
I'm
not
cut
out
for
it,
Even
my
own
dad
knew
He
dumped
me
at
that
school
...and
I
never
heard
from
him
again.
My
dad
wasn't
really
I
doubt
he
was
worse
than
mine.
Oh,
yeah?
My
father
was
an
ogre.
I
guess
I
should
have
realized
it.
He
bathed
me
in
barbecue
sauce
and
I
guess
that's
pretty
bad.
It
may
be
hard
to
believe,
what,
with
my
obvious
charm
but
people
used
And
for
a
long
time,
I
believed
them.
But
after
a
while,
you
learn
to
ignore
and
just
trust
who
you
are.
You
know...
you're
okay,
Shrek.
You
just
need
to
do
a
little
less
Thanks,
Artie.
The
soap's
because
Yeah...
I
got
that.
This
place
is
filthy!
I
feel
like
a
hobo.
I'm
sorry,
but
this
Everything's
always
about
you.
Maybe
it
just
bothers
you
You
mean
in
that
rigged
election?
Give
me
a
break.
"Rapunzel,
Rapunzel...
...Iet
down
thy
golden
extensions!"
Ladies,
let
go
of
your
petty
complaints
So
I
guess
the
plan
is
in
this
stinkhole
until
we
rot.
No,
we
get
inside
and
find
out
I
know
he's
a
jerk
and
everything,
but
that
Charming
That's
it!
Come
on!
This
way!
Rapunzel,
wait!
Charming,
let
go
of
her.
But
why
would
I
want
to
do
that?
What?
Say
hello,
ladies,
Rapunzel,
how
could
you?
Jealous
much?
Soon
you'll
be
back
scrubbing
floors
That
is,
if
I
let
you
last
the
week.
Pookie,
you
promised
not
to
hurt
them.
Not
here,
kitten
whiskers.
Now
forgive
us.
Shrek
will
be
back
soon,
Sorry?!
Don't
you
realize
once
Shrek
...he's
doomed?
Look
out!
They
got
a
piano!
Kill
them
all...
except
the
fat
one.
King
Charming
has
something
special
King
Charming?
Attack!
Artie,
duck!
Ready
the
plank!
-
Shrek!
Cowards!
What
has
Charming
done
with
Fiona?
She's
going
to
get
what's
coming
to
her.
And
there
ain't
nothing
-
We've
got
to
save
her.
Get
yourself
back
No,
Shrek.
Hold
on.
I've
got
an
idea.
I
am
a
buzzing
bee.
Mr.
Merlin?
...I
mean
us,
back
to
Far
Far
Away.
Forget
it.
I
don't
have
that
kind
How
about
a
hug?
Please.
I
know
you
can
do
it.
I
said
forget
it!
But...
What's
with
you?
It's
just
so
hard,
you
know?
They
need
to
get
back,
'Cause
there's
a
really
bad
man.
It's
just
so
hard!
Take
it
easy.
No!
I
don't
think
you
understand!
There's
a
mean
person
doing
Have
a
heart,
old
man.
They
really
need
your
help
to
get
back.
Okay.
I'll
go
get
my
things.
Piece
of
cake.
Well,
well.
You
want
eggs
with
that
ham?
I
am
a
little
rusty,
so
there
-
Side
effects?
Whatever
it
is,
no
matter
it
will
wear
off
eventually.
I
think.
-
Oops.
If
Artie
trusts
him,
Even
if
his
robe
doesn't
cover...
Alacritious
expeditious...
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!
Let's
help
our
friends
get
back...
...soon!
It
worked!
I
haven't
been
on
a
trip
Donkey?
What?
Is
something
in
my
teeth?
Oh,
no!
I've
been
abracadabra-ed
into
At
least
you
don't
look
You
should
think
about
going
on
a
diet!
You
should
get
yourself
a
pair
of
pants.
So
you
two
think
this
is
funny?
I'm
really
sorry,
guys.
Don't
be.
You
got
us
back,
kid.
How
in
the
Hans
Christian
Andersen
am
I
supposed
to
parade
around
Hey,
hey,
hey!
They
were
made
in
Madrid
You'll
learn
to
control
that.
Seriously.
Ow!
You
need
some
comfort
Watch
it.
I'm
walking
here
Pinocchio!
Shrek!
Help
me!
-
What
happened?
Fiona
and
the
Princesses
got
away.
She's
what?!
What?!
Puss!
Loan
me
five
bucks.
You
heard
him.
Help
the
brother
out.
Do
you
see
any
pockets
on
me?
Hold
on
a
second.
I
had
no
idea,
really.
I...
I
swear.
Quick!
Where
is
Fiona?
Charming
has
her
locked
away
He's
probably
getting
ready
Wait,
Pinocchio!
What
show?
"It's
a
Happily
Ever
After
After
All".
"Shrek's
final
performance"?
Shrek!
You
didn't
tell
us
I
guess
I've
been
so
busy
The
ogre!
Get
him!
Don't
worry,
jefe.
I
got
this.
Uck!
Kill
it!
Look.
Don't
you
know
who
We're
dealing
with
amateurs.
He's
a
star,
people!
Hello?
I'm
going
to
lose
it!
Is
everything
ready?
You
did
get
Breakfast
croissant
stuffed
And
I
hope
you
have
the
saffron
corn
Our
client
cannot
get
without
jalapeno
honey
butter!
I
just
lost
it.
They
should
talk
to
Nancy
Oh,
we
will
have
much
to
say
"With
this
sword,
I
do..."
No.
"With..."
"With
this
sword,
I
do
smote
thee!"
Is
"smote"
the
right
word?
"Smoot"?
I
don't
think
that's
a
word.
Maybe
I
should
just
"smite"
him.
Shrek
attacks
me.
"Now
the
kingdom
will
get
the
happily
Blah,
blah,
blah.
Oh,
Who
told
you
to
stop
dancing?!
Wink
and
turn.
What
are
you
laying
around
for?
Our
happily
ever
after
And
I
assure
you...
...the
people
of
this
kingdom
...we've
had
to
wait.
Break
a
leg.
On
second
thought,
Thank
goodness.
I
was
afraid
Where's
Fiona?
Don't
worry.
She
and
the
others
Let
me
guess.
Arthur.
It's
Artie,
actually.
This
boy
is
supposed
to
be
How
pathetic.
Stand
still,
so
I
won't
make
a
mess.
Charming,
stop!
I'm
here
now.
This
isn't
about
him.
Then
who's
it
about?
You
weren't
really
next
in
line
I
was.
But
you
said
the
King
Not
exactly.
What
does
that
mean?
I
said
whatever
I
had
to
say,
all
right?
I
wasn't
right
for
the
job,
And
you
fit
the
bill.
So
just
go!
You
were
playing
me
the
whole
time.
You
catch
on
real
fast,
kid.
Maybe
you're
not
You
know,
for
a
minute...
-...I
actually
thought...
That
he
cared
about
you?
He's
an
ogre.
What
did
you
expect?
You
really
do
have
a
way
Leave
me
out
with
the
waste
This
is
not
what
I
do
It's
the
wrong
time
She's
pulling
me
through
It's
a
small
crime
And
I
got
no
excuse
And
is
that
all
right,
yeah?
Is
that
all
right
with
you?
Is
that
all
right,
yeah?
If
I
give
my
gun
away
when
it's
loaded?
If
you
don't
shoot
it
Is
that
all
right?
Is
that
all
right
with
you?
No.
No.
Had
we
stayed
put
like
I
suggested,
we'd
be
sipping
tea
Yeah,
heart-shaped
cups.
And
eating
crumpets
Yeah,
loganberries.
-
Shut
up,
Cindy.
-
No,
you
shut
up.
Who
cares
who's
"running
the
kingdom"?
-
I
care.
I
have
your
badge
number,
tin
can!
-
Donkey?
Puss?
I
am
Puss,
stuck
here
And
I'm
me!
But
you're...
Everything's
fruity
in
the
loops,
we
went
to
high
school,
and
we
got
bippity-boppity-booped
You
poor
sweet
things.
I
don't
get
it.
The
cat
turned
into
a
little
horse
Who
dat?
Where's
Shrek?
Charming
has
him.
He
plans
to
kill
Shrek
All
right,
everyone.
You're
right.
What
are
you
doing?
Waiting
to
be
rescued.
You've
got
to
be
kidding
me.
What
else
can
we
do?
We're
just
four...
...
I
mean
three,
super-hot
princesses...
...two
circus
freaks,
a
pregnant
ogre
Excuse
me.
Old
lady
coming
through.
Mom!
You
didn't
think
you
got
your
fighting
Excuse
me.
There's
still
one
more.
Why
don't
you
just
lie
down?
Okay,
girls,
from
here
on
out...
...we
take
care
of
business
ourselves.
The
Far
Far
Away
Theatre
at
the

"It's
A
Happily
Ever
After
Enjoy
your
evening
Oi!
No
food
or
beverages
in
the
theater!
Places,
everyone!
Easy!
Sorry.
I
was
showing
off
It's
Bring
Your
Kids
to
Work
Day.
Well,
she's
got
your
eye.
Who
would
have
thought
a
monster
like
Little
birdies,
take
wing
Flitting
down
from
the
trees
they
appear
And
to
chirp
in
my
ear
All
because
I
sing
Move
it!
Go!
My
babies!
Help!
Hey,
how's
it
goin'?
O
to
the
K.
The
coast
is
clear.
Let's
do
this.
Go,
Team
Dynamite!
I
thought
we
agreed
to
use
the
name
I
recall
it
was
Team
Awesome.
I
voted
for
Team
Alpha
Wolf
Squadron.
Okay!
From
henceforth,
we
will
be
Team
Alpha
Super
Awesome
Ach
de
liebe!
There
is
some
strange
Artie!
Wait,
wait!
Where
is
the
fire,
seor?
Please.
Don't
act
so
innocent.
You
both
knew
what
was
going
on
It's
not
like
it
seems.
It's
not?
I
think
it
seems
pretty
clear.
He
was
using
me.
That's
all.
Using
you?
You
really
don't
get
it.
Shrek
only
said
Charming
was
going
to
kill
you,
Artie!
Cue
the
spot!
I
wait
alone
up
here
I'm
trapped
another
day
Locked
up
here,
please
set
me
free
My
new
life
I
almost
see
A
castle,
you
and
me
Yes,
a
castle,
you
and
me
Cherubs!
Tis
I,
Tis
I
Princess,
my
love
At
last
you
shall
be
freed
And
brave
With
speed!
With
might!
-
Through
the
blistering
desert
-
Across
the
stormiest
sea
Facing
creatures
so
vile
Foul!
So
you
can
gaze
upon
me!
I
knew
you'd
come
for
me
And
now
we
finally
meet
I
knew
you'd
wait
And
from
my
plate
of
love
you'd
eat
Who
is
this
terribly
ugly
fiend
Will
Charming
fight
or
flee?
Please
rescue
me!
From
this
monstrosity!
Fear
thee
not,
honey
lamb!
Oh,
boy.
You
are
about
to
enter
a
world
of
pain
With
which
you
are
not
familiar!
It
can't
be
any
more
painful
"Prepare,
foul
beast."
Prepare,
foul
beast,
your
time
is
done!
Could
you
kill
me
and
then
sing?
Be
quiet!
I'm
just
having
fun
with
you.
Thank
you.
Do
they
come
in
men's
sizes?
Now
that
be
funny!
Enough!
Now
you'll
finally
...to
have
everything
you
worked
for...
...everything
that's
precious
to
you,
Now
you'll
know
how
I
felt.
Sausage
roll!
Pray
for
mercy
from
Puss!
And
Donkey!
D
Hi,
honey.
Sorry
we're
late.
You
okay?
Much
better,
now
that
you're
here.
So,
Charming,
you
want
to
let
me
out
of
Ooh,
that
sounds
fun.
No!
Let
go
of
me!
You
will
not
ruin
things
Everybody,
stop!
Oh,
what
is
it
now?!
Artie?
Who
thinks
we
need
You
mean
you
want
to
be
villains
But
we
are
villains!
You
never
wish
Easy
for
you
to
say.
You're
not
You
morons!
Don't
listen
to
him!
Attack!
What
Steve
means
is
when
the
whole
world's
against
you.
Right.
Thanks,
Ed.
Fair
enough.
You're
right.
But
you
know...
...a
good
friend
once
told
me...
...just
because
people
treat
you
...or
just
some
loser...
...doesn't
mean
you
are
one.
What
matters
most
If
there's
something
you
really
want,
...the
only
person
standing
-
Me?
No,
no,
no!
What
I
mean
is
each
of
you...
...is
standing
in
your
own
way.
I
always
wanted
to
play
the
flute.
I'd
like
to
open
up
a
spa...
in
France!
I
grow
daffodils.
And
they're
beautiful.
A
new
era
finally
begins!
Now
all
of
you...
...bow
before
your
King!
You
need
to
work
on
your
aim.
This
was
supposed
to
be
Well,
you
need
to
keep
looking...
...because
I'm
not
giving
up
mine.
Mommy?
It's
yours
if
you
want
it.
But
this
time
it's
your
choice.
Author!
Artie!
Artie!
Artie!
Artie!
Excuse
me.
That's
my
seat.
Okay,
Seor
Hocusy-Pocusy,
the
time
Though
I
have
been
enjoying
Please
say
you
didn't.
All
right!
Look.
You'll
feel
a
pinch
and
possibly
...but
this
should
do
the
trick.
-
Are
you...?
-
And
I
am
not
you!
Oops.
Ah,
never
mind.
What
did
I
tell
you?
Well,
for
what
it's
worth,
I
have
something
Finally.
Dada.
Was
I
wrong
about
the
world?
I
smell
Shrek
Junior!
Where
else
could
a
creep
like
me
Meet
such
a
pretty

Meeting
every
day
with
the
rising
sun
Looking
up,
it's
looking
like
My
losing
streak
is
done
Peek-a-boo!
Peek-a-boo!
A
bouncy,
bouncy,
boy!
Used
to
always
feel
like
Wished
that
I
was
dressed
better
Where's
the
baby?
Never
had
a
lot
of
luck
Meeting
every
day
with
the
rising
sun
Looking
up,
it's
looking
like
My
losing
streak
is
done
My
losing
streak
is
done
Well...

shall
we

to
thank
you

Look

my
hips!
I
want
to
thank
you
for
letting
me
Again!
-
Break
it
down!
Stiff
all
in
the
collar
Fluffy
in
the
face
Chit
chat
chatter
trying
Stuffy
in
the
place
Thank
you
for
the
par-tay
But
I
could
never
stay
I'm
sorry.
I
got
many
things
on
my
mind
But
the
word's
in
the
way
And
I
want
to
thank
you
for
letting
me
Again
Different
strokes
for
different
folks
Thank
you
for
letting
me
be
myself
Again
Break
it
down!
Puss
and
Donkey,
baby!

All

Everyday

Sing
a
simple
song
Mama's

Mama

to
cry
Papa's

singing
You

make
it
if
you

Thank
you
for
letting
me

myself
Again
Thank
