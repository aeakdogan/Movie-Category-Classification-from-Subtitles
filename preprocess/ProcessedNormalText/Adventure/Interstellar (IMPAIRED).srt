WOMAN
1:
Well,
my
dad
was
a
farmer.
Um,
like
everybody
else
back
then.
Of
course,
he
didn't
start
that
way.


MAN
:
-
Nah,
I
got
this.
-
Shutting
it
down,
Cooper.
-
Shutting
it
all
down.

GIRL:
Dad?

Sorry,
Murph.
Go
back
to
bed.
-
I
thought
you
were
the
ghost.
There
are
no
such
things
Grandpa
says
you
can
get
ghosts.
Maybe
that's
because
Grandpa's
a
little
Were
you
dreaming
about
the
crash?
Get
your
butt
back
in
bed,
Murph.
Heh.
WOMAN
1:
The
wheat
had
died.
The
blight
came
and
we
had
to
burn
it.
And
we
still
had
corn.
But,
uh...
mostly
we
had
dust.
WOMAN
2:
I
guess
I
can't
describe
it.
Just
that
steady
blow
of
dirt.
WOMAN
3:
sometimes
over
our
nose
and
mouth...
so
that
we
wouldn't
breathe
MAN:
Well,
when
we
set
the
table,
Glasses
or
cups,
Shake
a
leg!
Murph,
get
a
move
on!
Tom,
4:00
today,
you
and
me
in
the
barn,
-
Check?
Not
at
the
table,
Murph.
Dad,
can
you
fix
this?
-
COOPER:
What
the
heck
did
you
do
to
my
lander?
Let
me
guess.
It
was
your
ghost?
It
knocked
it
off.
-
TOM:
No
such
thing
as
ghosts,
dumb-ass.
-
I
looked
it
up.
It's
called
a
poltergeist.
Well,
it's
not
very
scientific,
Murph.
You
said
science
was
about
admitting
-
She's
got
you
there.
Coop.
All
right,
Murph,
Don't
tell
me
you're
afraid
of
some
ghost.
You
got
to
record
the
facts,
analyze,
then
present
your
conclusions.
Deal?
-
Deal.
-
Have
a
good
day
at
school.
Parent-teacher
conferences.
Parent.

Slow
down,
turbo!
-
That's
not
a
dust
storm.
Blight?
MAN:
They're
saying
Ever.
He
should've
planted
corn
Now,
be
nice
to
that
Miss
Hanley.
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
Repopulating
the
earth.
Why
don't
you
start
All
right,
Murph,
give
me
second.
Uh-huh.
Third.

-
Find
a
gear,
dumb-ass.
Shut
it,
Tom!
-
What'd
you
do,
Murph?
-
Blew
a
tire
is
all.
Shut
up!
-
Grab
the
spare,
Tom.
COOPER:
Get
the
patch
kit!
-
TOM:
How
am
I
supposed
to
patch
it
out
here?
I'm
not
always
gonna
be
here
What's
going
on,
Murph?
Why
did
you
and
Mom
name
me
-
We
didn't.
Murphy's
Law
doesn't
mean
What
it
means
is
And
that
sounded
just
fine
with
us.

Whoa!
Get
in.
Get
in,
let's
go.
What
about
the
flat
tire?
Yeah.
It's
an
Indian
Air
Force
drone.
Take
the
wheel,
Tom.
Go,
go,
go!
Keep
that
aimed
right
at
it.
Faster,
Tom.
I'm
losing
it.
Right
at
it.
Stay
on
it.
Here
we
go.
Whoa.
Nice
one,
Tom.
Dad?
I
almost
got
it.
Don't
stop.
Don't
stop!
-
Dad!

You
told
me
to
keep
driving.
Well,
I
guess
that
answers
the
old
-
We
lost
it.
Want
to
give
it
a
whirl?
This
way.
Go.
Let's
lay
her
down
right
there
Nicely
done.
TOM:
COOPER:
Delhi
Mission
Control
-
...ten
years
ago.
So
for
ten
years?
-
Why
did
it
come
down
so
low?
Maybe
the
sun
cooked
its
brain
-
What?
Maybe
some
kind
of
signal?
I
don't
know.
What
are
you
gonna
do
with
it?
I'm
gonna
give
it
something
like
drive
a
combine.
Can't
we
just
let
it
go?
It
wasn't
hurting
anybody.
This
thing
needs
to
learn
how
to
adapt,
COOPER:
How's
this
work?
I've
got
class.
This
one
needs
to
wait.
-
What
did
you
do?
-
Am
I
gonna
be
mad?
-
Just
please
try
not
to.
I
got
this.
-
Little
late,
Coop.
And
I
guess
you
had
to
stop
off
No,
actually,
sir,
With
outstanding
solar
cells.
Take
a
seat.
So,
uh...
we
got
Tom's
scores
back.
He's
going
to
make
an
excellent
farmer.
Yeah,
he's
got
a
knack
for
it.
The
university
only
takes
a
handful.
I
still
pay
my
taxes.
Where's
that
money
go?
Well,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
university.
-
Look,
Coop,
you
have
to
be
realistic.
-
The
kid's
15.
What's
your
waistline?
About
what,
32?
-
About
a
33
inseam?
It
takes
two
numbers
to
measure
your
ass
Come
on.
-
And
a
trained
pilot.
Okay,
well,
right
now
We
didn't
run
out
of
television
screens
The
world
needs
farmers.
-
And
Tom.
We're
a
caretaker
generation,
Coop.
-
Maybe
your
grandkids
will
get
to
be
engin...
No.
Miss
Hanley's
here
to
talk
about
Murph.
HANLEY:
Murph
is
a
great
kid.
But
she's
been
having
She
brought
this
in
to
show
the
students.
Yeah,
it's
one
of
my
old
textbooks.
It's
an
old
federal
textbook.
We've
Corrected?
Explaining
how
the
Apollo
missions
You
don't
believe
we
went
to
the
moon?
It
was
a
brilliant
piece
of
propaganda.
The
Soviets
bankrupted
themselves
-
into
rockets
and
other
useless
machines.
If
we
don't
want
a
repeat
of
the
excess
we
need
to
teach
our
kids
about
this
planet,
One
of
those
useless
machines
If
we
had
any
of
those
left,
the
cyst
in
my
wife's
brain
Then
she'd
have
been
the
one
which
would
have
been
a
good
thing,
the
calmer
one.
I'm
sorry
about
your
wife,
Mr.
Cooper.
But
Murph
got
into
a
fistfight
Apollo
nonsense.
So
we
thought
it
best
you
might
have
for
dealing
Yeah,
you
know
what?
She's
going
through
Her
favorite
team
is
playing.
I
think
I'll
take
her
to
that.

How'd
it
go?
I
got
you
suspended.
-
What?
This
is
Cooper.
Go.
Coop,
those
combines
you
rebuilt
Just
reset
the
controllers.
I
did
that.
MAN:
One
by
one
they've
been
Something's
interfering
Magnetism
or
some
such.

MURPH:
Nothing
special
about
which
book.
-
I
counted
the
spaces.
In
case
the
ghost
I'm
trying
Morse.
Morse?
Yeah.
-
Dots
and
dashes,
used...
I
just
don't
think
your
bookshelf's
Had
to
reset
every
compass
clock
and
GPS
-
Which
is?
If
the
house
was
built
we'd
have
seen
this
the
first
time
I
hear
your
meeting
at
the
school
Heh.
You
heard?
It's
like
we've
forgotten
Explorers,
pioneers,
not
caretakers.
When
I
was
a
kid...
it
felt
like
they
made
something
new
gadget
or
idea.
But
six
billion
people...
And
every
last
one
of
them

This
world
isn't
so
bad.
And
Tom
will
do
just
fine.
Born
40
years
too
late,
My
daughter
knew
it,
God
bless
her.
And
your
kids
know
it.
Especially
Murph.
Well,
we
used
to
look
up
in
the
sky
at
our
place
in
the
stars.
Now
we
just
look
down
and
worry
Cooper,
you
were
good
at
something...
and
you
never
got
a
chance
I'm
sorry.
WOMAN
4:
You
didn't
expect
this
dirt
to
turn
on
you
like
that
In
April...
I
believe
I'm
right...
This
happened
about
1:30
when
that
thing...

In
my
day,
we
had
real
ballplayers.
COOPER:
In
my
day,
people
were
too
busy
Popcorn
at
a
ballgame
is
unnatural.
School
says
you're
gonna
follow
I
think
that's
great.
-
You
think
that's
great?
Grandpa
said.
COOPER:
Grandpa
said,
huh?
Listen,
all
that
matters
I
like
what
you
do.
I
like
our
farm.
You're
gonna
be
great
at
it.


Let's
get
out
of
here.
COOPER:
All
right,
it's
a
doozy.
All
right,
gang,
let's
mask
up.
-
Tom?
Murph?
Check?
Murph,
Tom,
you
guys
shut
your
windows?
Murph?
MURPH:
The
ghost.
Grab
your
pillow.
You're
sleeping
in
with
Tom.
COOPER:
It's
not
a
ghost.
It's
gravity.
DONALD:
You
want
to
clean
that
up
It's
not
Morse,
Murph.
It's
binary.
Thick
is
one,
thin
is
zero.
Coordinates.
Nope.
Mm-mm.
Here
we
go.
Thirty-three.
That's
it.
I
can't
miss
this!
Grandpa
will
be
back
But
you
don't
know
And
that...
is
why
I
can't
take
you.
Murph?
Grandpa
will
be
home
in
a
while.
-
Aah!
-
What
are
you
doing?
Oh,
you
think
this
is
funny?
Huh?
You
wouldn't
be
here
Make
yourself
useful.

Hey,
Murph?
Murph.
I
think
this
is
the
end
of
the
road.
Didn't
you
bring
the
bolt
cutters?
That's
my
girl.
MAN'S
VOICE:
Step
away!
COOPER:
Don't
shoot!
I'm
not
armed.


-
MAN'S
VOICE:
Don't
be
afraid.
MAN'S
VOICE:
Where's
my
daughter?
You
had
the
coordinates
for
this
facility
Where's
my
daughter?
Don't
make
me
take
you
down
again.
COOPER:
Oh,
you
still
think
Marines
don't
exist
anymore.
-
And
I
got
grunts
like
you
mowing
my
grass.
But
you
don't
look
much
Think
I'll
turn
you
WOMAN:
No,
you
won't.
TARS,
back
down,
please.
You
know,
you're
taking
a
risk
They're
old,
and
their
control
units
It's
what
the
government
could
spare.

Who
are
you?
Dr.
Brand.
I
knew
a
Dr.
Brand
once.
What
makes
you
think
I'm
not?
Wasn't
near
as
cute,
either.
Please,
Dr.
Brand.
Now
I'm
scared
for
my
daughter
You
give
me
that,
Get
the
principals
and
the
girl
Your
daughter
is
fine.
Bright
kid.
Must
have
a
very
smart
mother.
It's
pretty
clear
So
why
don't
you
just
let
us
back
up
from
-
It's
not
that
simple.
I
don't
know
anything
about
you.
Yes,
you
do.
Dad!
Hello,
Cooper.
Professor
Brand.
MAN:
Explain
to
me
Kind
of
an
accident.
We
sort
of
stumbled
You're
sitting
in
the
best-kept
secret
Nobody
stumbles
in
here.
BRAND:
Cooper,
please.
Look.
It's
kind
of
hard
to
explain.
We
learned
these
coordinates
What
sort
of
anomaly?
I
hesitate
to
term
it
supernatural,
You're
going
to
have
to
be
specific,
It
was
gravity.
Um,
what
sort
of
gravitational
anomaly?
Now,
I'm
real
happy
that
you're
excited
but
you're
not
getting
any
answers
-
Assurances?
Like,
that
we're
getting
out
of
here.

-
Don't
you
know
who
we
are,
Coop?
WOMAN:
We're
NASA.
-
NASA?
The
same
NASA
you
flew
for.
COOPER:
for
refusing
to
drop
bombs
When
they
realized
not
a
long-term
solution,
-
In
secret.
BRAND:
Because
public
opinion
Not
while
you're
struggling
Blight.
Wheat
seven
years
ago.
Okra
this
year.
Now
there's
just
corn.
And
we're
growing
more
But
like
the
potatoes
in
Ireland
the
corn
will
die.
Soon.

We'll
find
a
way,
professor.
Driven
by
the
unshakable
faith
Not
just
ours,
no.
But
it
is
our
home.
Earth's
atmosphere
is
80
percent
nitrogen.
Blight
does.
And
as
it
thrives,
The
last
people
to
starve
And
your
daughter's
generation...
will
be
the
last
to
survive
on
Earth.
WOMAN:
Murph
is
feeling
tired.
I
was
wondering
Yeah.
Thank
you.
Alright...
now
you
need
to
tell
me
We're
not
meant
to
save
the
world.
COOPER:
Rangers.
The
last
components
of
our
one
versatile
ship
Our
final
expedition.
You
sent
people
out
there
The
Lazarus
missions.
-
Oh,
that
sounds
cheerful.
Sure,
but
he
had
to
die
There's
not
a
planet
in
our
solar
system
and
the
nearest
star's
That
doesn't
even
qualify
as
futile.
Where'd
you
send
them?
Cooper...
I
can't
tell
you
anymore
-
You're
the
best
pilot
we
ever
had.
This
team
never
left
the
simulator.
We
need
a
pilot,
and
this
is
the
mission
Without
even
knowing
it?
An
hour
ago,
you
didn't
even
know
We
had
no
choice.
-
They
chose
you.
How
long
would
I
be
gone?
Hard
to
know.
Years?
-
I've
got
kids,
professor.
Who's
"they"?
We
started
detecting
gravitational
Mostly
small
distortions
to
our
instruments
In
fact,
I
believe
Yeah,
over
the
Straights.
My
crash.
Exactly.
But
of
all
these
anomalies,
Out
near
Saturn...
a
disturbance
of
space-time.
-
Is
that
a
Wormhole?
-
And
it
leads
where?
A
wormhole's
not
Someone
placed
it
there.
-
"They"?
And
whoever
they
are,
That
Wormhole
lets
us
travel
to
other
stars.
They've
put
potentially
habitable
worlds
Twelve,
in
fact,
-
You
sent
probes
into
that?
We
sent
people
into
it.
Ten
years
ago.
The
Lazarus
missions.
BRAND:
Twelve
possible
worlds,
the
bravest
humans
ever
to
live...
Each
person's
landing
pod
But
they
could
use
hibernation
making
observations
on
organics
Their
mission
was
to
assess
their
world,
then
they
could
send
out
a
signal,
And
what
if
the
world
Hence
the
bravery.
You
don't
have
the
resources
No.
Data
transmission
back
through
Simple
binary
pings
on
an
annual
basis
give
us
And
one
system
shows
promise.
One.
That's
a
bit
One
system
with
three
potential
worlds?
No
long
shot.
Okay.
So
if
we
find
a
home...
-
...then
what?
There's
a
Plan
A
and
a
Plan
B.
Did
you
notice
anything
strange
COOPER:
Some
kind
of
vehicle.
A
space
station?
-
BRAND:
Both.
Plan
A.
The
first
gravitational
anomalies
Suddenly
we
knew
So
I
started
working
on
a
theory
But
you
haven't
solved
it
yet.
That's
why
there's
Plan
B.
The
problem
is
gravity.
How
to
get
This
is
one
way.
Plan
B:
A
population
bomb.
Over
5,000
fertilized
eggs
How
would
you
raise
them?
With
equipment
on
board,
After
that,
with
surrogacy,
Within
30
years,
The
real
difficulty
with
colonization
This
takes
care
of
that.
But
what
about
the
people
here?
You
give
up
on
them?
My
kids?
That's
why
Plan
A
is
a
lot
more
fun.
-
How
far
have
you
got?
You're
asking
me
to
hang
everything...
on
an
almost.
I'm
asking
you
to
trust
me.

Find
us
a
new
home.
And
by
the
time
you
return...
I
will
have
solved
I
give
you
my
word.
MURPH:
Go
away!
Murph.
MURPH:
Go!
If
you're
leaving,
just
go.
DONALD:
This
world
was
never
enough
What,
because
heading
out
there
And
it
excites
me?
Heh.
No,
that
does
not
make
it
wrong.
It
might.
Don't
trust
the
right
thing
The
why
of
the
thing,
And
the
foundation's
solid.
We
farmers,
we
sit
here
every
year
"Next
year."
Well,
next
year
ain't
gonna
save
us,
This
world's
a
treasure,
Donald,
Mankind
was
born
on
Earth,
Tom
will
be
all
right,
but
you
got
I
will.
Without
making
promises
You
have
to
talk
to
me,
Murph.
I
need
to
fix
this
before
I
go.
MURPH:
Then
I'll
keep
it
broken
After
you
kids
came
along,
your
mom
said
She
said,
"Now...
we're
just
here
And
I
think
that
now
I
understand
Once
you're
a
parent,
You
said
ghosts
didn't
exist.
That's
right,
Murph.
Murph,
look
at
me.
I
can't
be
your
ghost
right
now.
I
need
to
exist.
They
chose
me.
Murph,
they
chose
me.
You
saw.
That's
exactly
why
you
can't
go.
I
figured
out
the
message.
-
One
word.
Know
what
it
is?
"Stay."
-
It
says,
"Stay,"
Dad.
You
don't
believe
me.
Look
at
the
books!
Look
at
this.
Why...?
You're
not
listening!
-
No,
I'm
coming
back.
One
for
you,
one
for
me.
When
I'm
up
there
in
hypersleep,
or...
traveling
near
the
speed
of
light,
or...
near
a
black
hole...
time's
gonna
change
for
me.
When
we
get
back...
we're
gonna
compare.
-
MURPH:
Time
will
run
differently
for
us?
By
the
time
I
get
back,
"What?"
Imagine
that!
Aw,
Murph...
You
have
no
idea
when
you're
coming
back.
No
idea
at
all!
Murph,
don't...
Come
on,
Murph!
Don't
make
me
leave
like
this,
Murph!
Hey...
I
love
you.
Forever.
You
hear
me?
I
love
you
forever,
and
I'm
coming
back.
I'm
coming
back.
-
How'd
it
go?
Just
fine.
I
love
you,
Tom.
-
Travel
safe,
huh?
You
look
after
our
place
-
All
right?
-
Hey,
can
I
use
your
truck
while
you're
gone?
I'll
make
sure
they
bring
it
back.
Look
after
my

There
is
Mach

Everybody
good?
They
gave
him
a

He
thinks
it
relaxes
us.
A
giant
sarcastic
robot.
What
a
great
idea!
TARS:
I
have
a
cue
light
I
can
use
That'd
probably
help.
You
can
use
it
to
find
your
way
back
-
What's
your

TARS?
Let's
bring
it
on
down

It's

We're
going
to
be

-
We
should
learn
to
talk.
Just
being
honest.
I
don't
think
you
need
to
be
that
honest.
Hey,
TARS,
what's
your
honesty
parameter?
-
TARS:
Ninety
percent.
Absolute
honesty
isn't
always
nor
the
safest
form
of
communication
Okay.
Ninety
percent
it
is,
Dr.
Brand.
We
are
coming
up
on
the
Endurance.
Okay.
Taking

Approaching

It's
all
you,

Nice

Are
we
ready
to

-
Hello,

All
right,
we're
all
set.
All
right,
let's
do
it.
Heh.
COOPER:
Thirty
percent
of

One
G.
How's
gravity
treating
you
back
there?
Well.
Romilly?
Hey,
you
okay?
-
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah,
I
just
need
a
minute.
I
think
we
have
some
Dramamine
or
maybe
in
the
cryo-beds.
-
Hey,
Brand?
-
Bring
a
lot.
Amelia,
be
safe.
-
Give
my
regards
to
Dr.
Mann.
It
looks
good
for
your
trajectory.
That's
a
lot
of
Dramamine.
Look
after
my
family,
We'll
be
waiting
for
you
A
little
older,
a
little

Okay,
thank
you,

So
alone.
We
have

No,
I
mean
them.
Hm?
COOPER:
It's
a
perfect

No,
it's
not
like
looking
The
human
race
is
going
to
be...

desperate
for
a

can
cling
to
We
need
to
find
that
rock.
And
our
three
prospects
are
at
the
edge
Laura

Laura
started
our

program.

AMELIA:
Uh,
Wolf
Edmunds
is
here.
Oh,
uh...
Wolf's
a
particle
physicist.
None
of
them
had
families,
huh?
No.
No
attachments.
My
father
insisted.
They
all
knew
the
odds
against
I'm
hoping
we
can
surprise
-
How
about
Mann?
He's
remarkable.
He's
the
best
of
us.
He
inspired
11
people
to
follow
him
Scientists,
explorers.
That's
what
I
love.
Death,
but...
not
evil.
You
don't
think
nature
can
be
evil?
No.
Formidable.
Frightening.
But...
-
...no,
not
evil.
Is
a
lion
evil
Just
what
we
take
with
us,
then.
Yeah.
This
crew
represents
Even
me,
huh?
You
know
what?
We
agreed,
90
percent.
There
you
go.
-
Don't
stay
up.
Just
remember,
Coop,
Hey,
TARS?
Let's
go
over
TARS:
Eight
months
to
Mars.
Counter-orbital
slingshot
around.
Nothing's
changed
on
that.
Just
let
me
ask
you
something.
-
Dr.
Brand
and
Edmunds...
Dr.
Brand
and
Edmunds.
They
close?
I
wouldn't
know.
Is
that
90
percent
"wouldn't
know"
-
I
also
have
a
discretion
setting,
Cooper.
But
not
a
poker
face,
Slick.
Hey,
guys.
Uh,
Dad's
about
to
go
down
So
I
wanted
to
give
you
an
update.
Uh...
The
Earth
looks
amazing
from
here.
Um...
You
can't
see
any
of
the
dust.
Heh.
I
really
hope
you
guys
are
doing
great.
I
know
you're
gonna
get
this
message.
he's
gonna
get
it
to
you.
Know
that
I
love
you.
-
Is
it
him?
You
must
be
Donald.
Hello,
Murph.
Why
are
you
in
my
dad's
truck?
He
wanted
me
He
sent
you
a
message.
She's
pretty
upset
with
him
for
leaving.
If
you
record
any
messages,
Murph
is
a
bright
spark.
Maybe
I
should
fan
the
flame.
She's
already
making
fools
So
maybe
she
should
come
-
So
where
are
they?
The
next
time
you
hear
from
Cooper,
TOM
:
...administration
wants
me
But
they
said
I
could
start
All
right,
I
got
to
go,
Dad.
DONALD:
Um,
sorry,
Coop.
I
asked
Murph
to
say
hi,
I'll
try
again
next
time.
You
all
right,
Rom?

This
gets
to
me,
Cooper.
This.
This.
Millimeters
of
aluminum,
that's
it,
out
there
for
millions
of
miles
You
know
that
some
of
the
finest...
solo
yachtsmen
in
the
world
They
don't
know
how.
We're
explorers,
Rom.
This
is
our
boat.
Here.

[THUNDER
RUMBLING
COOPER:
It
was
in
orbit
around
the
Wormhole.
This
is
the
Wormhole,
we
would
receive
images
Oh,
yeah.
Exactly.
So
we
got
a
pretty
good
idea
Navigationally.
AMELIA:
Guys?
Looks
like
we'll
be
approaching
Hey,
Coop?
-
Can
we
stop
the
spinning?
Because
we're
close
enough
All
right.
Thanks.
There,
that's
it!
That's
the
Wormhole!
Say
it,
don't
spray
it,
Rom.
It's
a
sphere.
Of
course
it
is.
What,
you...?
No,
it's
just
that
all
the
illustrations
ROMILLY:
In
the
illustrations,
So
they
say
you
want
to
go
-
But
it's
too
far,
right?
So
a
Wormhole
bends
space
like
this,
a
higher
dimension.
Okay,
so...
to
show
that,
into
two
dimensions
which
turns
a
Wormhole
What's
a
circle
in
three
dimensions?
-
A
sphere.
A
spherical
hole.
But
who
put
it
there?
I'm
not
thanking
anybody
until
we
COOPER:
Any
trick
to
this,
Doyle?
No
one
knows.
The
others
made
it,
right?
At
least
some
of
them.
Everybody
ready
to
say
goodbye
To
our
galaxy.
Here
we
go.

The
controls
won't
work
here.
It's
space
beyond
our
three
dimensions.
What
is
that?
-
I
think
it's
them.
ROMILLY:
Don't!
Don't!

What
was
that?
The
first
handshake.
We're...
We're
here.
DOYLE:
-
How?
So
years
of
basic
data.
Miller's
site
has
kept
pinging
thumbs
up,
Edmunds'
went
down
three
years
ago.
Transmitter
failure?
Maybe.
He
was
sending
the
thumbs
up
But
Miller's
still
-
Because
she's
coming
up
fast.
With
one
complication.
The
planet
is
much
closer
to
Gargantua
-
COOPER:
Gargantua?
Miller's
and
Dr.
Mann's
planets
-
And
Miller's
is
on
the
horizon?
Landing
there
takes
us
And
a
black
hole
that
big
Look,
I
could
swing
around
AMELIA:
No,
it's
not
that.
It's
time.
The
gravity
on
that
planet
will
slow
How
bad?
Every
hour
we
spend
seven
years
back
on
Earth.
Jesus.
Well,
that's
relativity,
folks.
Well,
we
can't
just
drop
down
Cooper,
we
have
a
mission.
Yeah,
Doyle,
we
have
a
mission,
to
find
a
planet
that
can
habitate
You
can't
just
think
about
your
family.
I
am
thinking
about
my
family
Plan
A
does
not
work
if
the
people
on
Earth
No.
It
doesn't.
Okay.
Cooper's
right.
just
like
oxygen
and
food.
All
right,
look.
Dr.
Mann's
data
is
promising,
And
Edmunds',
it's
even
further.
Miller
hasn't
sent
much,
but
what
she
has
-
You
don't
find
that
every
day.
And
just
think
about
the
resources,
that
would
be
spent
-
Romilly...
...how
far
off
from
Miller's
planet
do
we
Just
back
from
the
cusp.
All
right,
which
is
here,
-
ROMILLY:
Right.
Here's
Gargantua.
Instead
of
taking
the
Endurance
which
would
conserve
fuel,
what
if
we
take
a
wider
orbit
parallel
with
Miller's
planet
Then
we
take
the
Ranger
down,
We
come
back,
we
analyze,
we
debrief.
We
lose
a
little
fuel,
-
That'll
work.
There's
no
time
for
monkey
business
So,
TARS,
CASE,
you're
with
me.
If
we're
talking
about
a
couple
years,
Observations
from
the
Wormhole,
COOPER:
Conserve
fuel,
minimize
thrusting,
-
You
got
it?
Dr.
Brand.
-
COOPER:
You
ready,
CASE?
-
You
don't
say
much,
do
you?
Detach.
-
Romilly,
are
you
reading
these
forces?
A
literal
heart
of
darkness.
If
we
could
just
see
the
singularity,
yeah,
-
And
we
can't
get
anything
from
it?
Not
even
light.
-
The
answer's
there,
just
no
way
to
see
it.
Goodbye,
Ranger.
CASE:
-
Should
we
use
the
thrusters
to
slow?
I'm
gonna
use
the
Ranger's
aerodynamics
CASE:
Air
brake?
-
We
want
to
get
down
fast,
don't
we?
-
Hang
on.

-
CASE:
We
should
ease!
The
only
time
I
went
down
was
-
A
little
caution...
-
Cooper,
it's
too
damn
fast!
-
CASE:
Should
I
disable
the
feedback?
Here
we
go.
It's
just
water!
The
stuff
of
life.
CASE:
Twelve
hundred
meters.
-
Do
we
have
a
fix
on
the
beacon?
-
Can
you
maneuver?
I'm
gonna
spiral
down
on
top
of
it.
CASE:
Seven
hundred.
On
my
cue,
CASE.
On
my
cue.
CASE:
Five
hundred
meters.
Fire!
-
Very
graceful.
But
very
efficient.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Let's
go!
Go,
go,
go!
Seven
years
per
hour
here.

CASE:
This
way.
About
200
meters.
The
gravity's
punishing.
Been
floating
through
space
too
long?
CASE:
110%
Earth
gravity.
COOPER:
Come
on.
Come
on.
-
There's
nothing
here.
If
the
signal's
Her
beacon.
DOYLE:
Wreckage.
Where's
the
rest?
Towards
the
mountains!
Those
aren't
mountains.
They're
waves.
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.
COOPER:
That
one's
moving
away
from
us.
AMELIA:
We
need
the
recorder.
Brand,
Doyle,
back
to
the
Ranger
now!
We're
not
leaving
without
her
data.
Get
back
here
now!
We
do
not
have
time!
The
second
wave
is
coming!
AMELIA:
No,
I
got
it.
Get
your
ass
back
to
the
Ranger
now!

Brand,
get
back
here
now!
AMELIA:
No,
Cooper,
go.
-
Go!
-
Go!
DOYLE:
Go,
go!
Go!
-
I'm
not
gonna
make
it!
Come
on,
CASE
has
her!
Come
on!
Get
to
the
hatch!
Go,
go!
Go!
Shit.
Manually
overriding
inside
hatch!
Cooper!
Wait!
COOPER:
The
engines
are
flooded!

Holy
shit.
Hang
on!

-
CASE,
what's
the
problem?
Goddamn
it!
-
I
told
you
to
leave
me!
Why
didn't
you?
-
One
of
us
was
thinking
about
the
mission!
I
was
trying
to
do
the
right
thing!
Can
you
tell
that
to
Doyle?
-
COOPER:
CASE,
how
much
time?
The
stuff
of
life,
huh?
A
lot.
Decades.


What
happened
to
Miller?
Judging
by
the
wreckage,
she
was
How's
the
wreckage
stayed
together
Because
of
the
time
slippage.
On
this
planet's
time,
She
probably
just
died
minutes
ago.
CASE:
The
data
Doyle
received
was
just
Oh,
we
are
not
prepared
for
this.
You
eggheads
have
the
survival
skills
Well,
we
got
this
far
on
our
brains.
Well,
not
far
enough!
And
now
we're
stuck
here
till
there
I'm
counting
every
minute,
Is
there
any
possibility...
I
don't
know,
some
kind
of
a
way
Gain
back
the
years?
Don't
shake
your
head
at
me.
Time
is
relative,
okay?
It
can
stretch
it
can't
run
backwards.
It
just
can't.
The
only
thing
that
can
move
across
Okay.
The
beings
that
led
us
here,
-
...through
gravity,
right?
Could
they
be
talking
to
us
-
Maybe.
"They"
are
beings
of
five
dimensions.
To
them,
time
might
be
To
them...
the
past
might
be
a
canyon
a
mountain
they
can
climb
up.
Look,
Cooper,
I
screwed
up.
I'm
sorry.
-
But
you
knew
about
relativity.

Brand...

my
daughter
was
10
years
old.
I
couldn't
teach
her
Couldn't
you
have
told
her
No.
When
you
become
a
parent,
And
that
is
that
you
want
to
make
sure
And
it
rules
out
telling
a
10-year-old
Cooper?

-
How
long
for
the
engines,
CASE?
We
don't
have
it.
Helmets
on!
Brand,
co-pilot,
you're
up.

-
We're
gonna
spark
it.
-
Locked.

up!
Hello,
Rom.
I've
waited
years.
How...?
How
many
years?

ROMILLY:
By
now
it
must
be...
four
months,
eight
days.
Doyle?
I
thought
I
was
prepared.
Reality's
different.
And
Miller?
There's
nothing
here
for
us.
Why
didn't
you
sleep?
Oh,
I
had
a
couple
of
stretches.
And
something
seemed
wrong
I
learned
what
I
could
but
I
couldn't
send
anything

been
receiving,

he
alive?
-
Yeah?

:
Hey,

Checking
in.
Saying
hi.
Um...
Finished

in
school.
Miss
Kurling's
still
Pulled
me
down,
but
seconds
not
bad.
Grandpa
attended
the
ceremony.
Um...
Oh.
I
met
another
girl,
Dad.
I,
uh...
I
really
think
this
is
the
one.
Name's
Lois.
That's
her
right
there.
Murphy
stole
Grandpa's
car.
She
crashed
it.
She's
okay,
though.
Hey,
Dad.
Look
at
this!
You're
a
grandpa.
His
name's
Jesse.
I
kind
of
wanted
to
call
him
Coop,
Donald
says
he's
already
earned

LOIS:
Oh,
dear.
Oh,
dear.
Say
"Bye-bye,
Grandpa."
Sorry
it's
been
a
while.
Just...
what
with
Jesse
and
all.
Uh...
Grandpa
died
last
week.
We
buried
him
out
in
the
back
forty
Jesse.
Which
is
where
we
would
have
buried
you
come
back.
Murph
was
there
at
the
funeral.
We
don't
see
her
that
much,
You
aren't
listening
to
this,
All
these
messages
are
just,
like...
drifting
out
there
in
the
darkness.
Lois
says
that,
uh...
I
have
to
let
you
go.
And,
uh...
So...
I
guess
I'm
letting
you
go.
I
don't
know
where
you
are,
Dad...
but
I
hope
that
you're
at
peace.
Goodbye.
Hey,
Dad.
Hey,
Murph.
You
son
of
a
bitch.
I
never
made
one
of
these
because
I
was
so
mad
at
you
for
leaving.
And
then
when
you
went
quiet,
it...
seemed
like
I
should
live
with
that
decision.
But
today's
my
birthday.
And
it's
a
special
one,
You
once
told
me
that
when
you
came
back,
And
today
I'm
the
age
you
were
So
it
would
be
a
real
good
time


I
didn't
mean
to
intrude.
It's
just
that
I've
never
been
in
here
before.
BRAND:
I
talk
to
Amelia
-
I'm
glad
you've
started.
I
just
had
something
-
I
know
they're
still
out
there.
There
are
so
many
reasons
their
I
know,
professor.
I'm
not
sure
what
I'm
more
afraid
of.
Them
never
coming
back
or...
coming
back
to
find
we've
failed.
Then
let's
succeed.
So...
back
to
the
fourth
iteration.
With
respect,
professor,
It
only
has
to
work
once,
Murph.
BRAND:
Every
rivet
that
they
strike
We've
done
well
for
the
world
here...
whether
or
not
we
crack
the
equation
-
Don't
be
morbid,
professor.
I'm
an
old
physicist.
I'm
afraid
of
time.
MURPH:
Time.
You're
afraid
of
time.
We've
been
trying
without
changing
-
And?
each
iteration
is
an
attempt
It's
recursive.
It's
nonsensical.
Are
you
calling
my
life's
work...
No,
I'm
saying
finish
it
with
one
arm...
And
I
don't
understand
why.
I'm
an
old
man,
Murph.
Can
we
take
this
point
up
I
want
to
talk
to
my
daughter.
BRAND
:
we
must
confront
the
reality
We
must
reach
far
beyond
We
must
think
not
as
individuals
Do
not
go
gentle
into
that
good
night
COOPER:
TARS
kept
the
Endurance
But
the
trip
took
years
longer
We
no
longer
have
the
fuel
we
have
to
choose.
But
how?
They're
both
promising.
Edmunds'
data
is
better,
but
Dr.
Mann
We've
no
reason
to
suspect
His
world
has
key
elements
-
As
does
Dr.
Mann's.
And...
I
really
believe
Edmunds'
-
Why?
Look
at
Miller's
planet.
but
no
life.
Sterile.
Because
of
the
black
hole?
Murphy's
Law.
Accident
is
the
first
building
block
But
when
you're
orbiting
a
black
hole
It
sucks
in
asteroids
and
comets,
We
need
to
go
further
afield.
You
once
said
that
Dr.
Mann...
was
the
best
of
us.
He's
remarkable.
And
yet...
Yet
here
he
is.
He's
on
the
ground,
and
he's
sending
telling
us
to
come
to
his
planet.
Granted,
but
Edmunds'
data
We
should
vote.
Well,
if
we
vote,
Brand?
He
has
a
right
to
know.
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
-
What
does?
-
ROMILLY:
Is
that
true?
And
that
makes
me
But
maybe
we've
spent
too
long
trying
You're
a
scientist,
Brand.
So
listen
to
me...
when
I
say
that
love
observable,
powerful.
It
has
to
mean
something.
Love
has
meaning,
yes.
Social
utility,
We
love
people
who
have
died.
None.
Maybe
it
means
something
more,
yet
understand.
Maybe
it's
some
evidence,
some...
artifact
of
a
higher
dimension
I'm
drawn
across
the
universe
who
I
know
is
probably
dead.
Love
is
the
one
thing
that
transcends
dimensions
Maybe
we
should
trust
that,
All
right,
Cooper...
yes...
the
tiniest
possibility
That
doesn't
mean
I'm
wrong.
Honestly,
Amelia...
it
might.
TARS,
chart
a
course
for
Dr.
Mann's.
TOM:
We'll
lose
about
a
third
again.
Next
year
I'm
gonna
work
Nelson's
farm
What
happened
to
Nelson?
LOIS:
Murph,
have
you
eaten
enough?
Oh,
no.
I'm
full,
thanks.
Coop,
finish
your
fritter,
please.
Will
you
spend
the
night?
Your
room
I
need
to
get
back.
LOIS:
My
sewing
machine
is
in
there,
I
need
to...
Too
many
memories.
We
might
have
something
for
that.

The
dust.
Lois,
I
have
a
friend
who...
could
look
at
his
lungs.

-
COOPER:
Amelia,
I'm
sorry.
Unless
you're
punishing
me
No,
this
wasn't
a
personal
decision.
If
you're
wrong,
you
will
have
Your
fuel
calculations
Strike
out
on
Mann's
planet,
and
we'll
have
or
push
on
to
Edmunds'
with
Plan
B.
Starting
a
colony
could
save
us
You
might
have
to
decide
and
the
future
of
the
human
race.
I
trust
you'll
be
as
objective
then.
He's
been
asking
for
you
We
were
trying
to
reach
you.
Murph.
I'm
here,
professor.
I
let
you
all
down.
No,
you
got
us
so
far.
Real
close.
I'll
finish
what
you
started.
Good,
good
Murph.
You
had
faith...
all
those...
all
those
years.
I...
I
asked
you
to
have
faith.
I
wanted
you
to
believe...
that
your
father...
would
come
back.
I
do,
professor.
-
Forgive
me,
Murph.
I...
I
lied,
Murph.
I
lied
to
you.
There
was
no
need
for
him
to...
To
come
back.
There
is
no
way
to
help
us.
But
Plan
A...
All
this.
All
these
people.
And
the
equation.
Did
my
father
know?
Did
he
leave
me?
Do...
not...
go...
gentle...
No.
No!
You
can't
leave.
You...
No.
MURPH:
Dr.
Brand,
I'm
sorry
to
tell
you
He
was
at
peace.
I'm
very
sorry
for
your
loss.
Brand,
did
you
know?
He
told
you,
right?
You
knew.
This
was
all
a
sham.
You
left
us
here.
To
suffocate.
To
starve.

COOPER:
Frozen
cloud.



It's
okay.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Pray
you
never
learn...
just
how
good
it
can
be
I
hadn't
a
lot
of
hope
after
so
long,
I
had
none.
My
supplies
were
completely
exhausted.
The
last
time
I
went
to
sleep,
You
have
literally
raised
me
-
Lazarus.
-
What
about
the
others?
So
far,
surely.
No,
our
present
situation
is
that
there's
AMELIA:
Dr.
Mann.
Dr.
Mann?
Tell
us
about
your
world.
Our
world,
we
hope.

Our
world,
uh...
is
cold...
stark...
but
undeniably
beautiful.
MANN:
The
days
are
67
hours
long,
cold.
The
nights
are...
67
far
colder
hours.
The
gravity
is
a
very,
very
pleasant
Now,
up
here
where
I
landed,
and
the
air
has
too
much
ammonia
to
breathe
but
down
at
the
surface,
the
chlorine
dissipates.
The
ammonia
gives
way
to
crystalline
To
organics.
Possibly
even
to
life.
We
might
be
sharing
this
world.
These
readings
are
from
the
surface?
Over
the
years,
-
COOPER:
How
far
have
you
explored?
But
with
oxygen
in
limited
supply,
-
TARS:
What
went
wrong
with
him,
sir?
He
misidentified
the
first
organics
We
struggled
on
for
a
time,
used
his
power
source
I
thought
I
was
alone
Would
you
like
me
to
look
at
him?
No.
No.
He
needs
a
human
touch.
Dr.
Brand,
CASE
is
relaying
a
message
Okay.
Be
right
there.
Excuse
me.
Dr.
Brand,
I'm
sorry
to
tell
you
He
had
no
pain.
He
was
at
peace.
I'm
sorry
for
your
loss.
AMELIA:
Is
that
Murph?
She's...
She's
grown.
Brand,
did
you
know?
He
told
you,
right?
You
knew.
This
was
all
a
sham.
You
left
us
here.
To
suffocate.
To
starve.
Did
my
father
know
too?

Dad?
I
just
want
to
know...
if
you
left
me
here
to
die.
I
just
have
to
know.
Cooper,
my...
My
father
dedicated...
his
whole
life
to
Plan
A.
MANN:
I
do.
He
never
even
hoped
No.
But
he's
been
trying
to
solve
Amelia,
your
father
solved
his
equation
Then
why
wouldn't
he
use
it?
The
equation
couldn't
reconcile
relativity
More?
More
what?
MANN:
More
data.
The
laws
of
nature
prohibit
Romilly,
is
that
true?
If
a
black
hole
is
an
oyster,
The
gravity's
so
strong,
it's
always
That's
why
we
call
it
a
black
hole.
Okay,
but
if
we
see
We
can't,
Coop.
MANN:
There
are
some
things
Your
father
had
to
find
another
way
-
Plan
B.
A
colony.
-
Why
keep
building
those
stations?
to
get
people
to
work
together
to
save
-
Or
their
children.
MANN:
You
never
would've
come
here
Evolution
has
yet
to
transcend
We
can
care
deeply,
but
that
empathy
rarely
extends
But
the
lie.
That
monstrous
lie?
Unforgivable.
And
he
knew
that.
He
was
prepared
to
destroy
his
own
humanity
-
He
made
an
incredible
sacrifice.
An
incredible
sacrifice
is
being
made
Because
in
his
fucking
arrogance...
he
declared
their
case
hopeless.
I'm
sorry,
Cooper...
No.
No.
We
are
the
future.
Cooper,
what
can
I
do?
Let
me
go
home.
MAN:
You're
absolutely
positive?
His
solution
was
correct.
-
It's
worthless?
Okay,
how
do
you
find
the
other
half?
Out
there?
A
black
hole.
-
But
stuck
down
here
on
Earth?
I'm
not
sure
you
can.
MAN:
God,
they
just
pack
up
and
leave.
What
are
they
hoping
to
find?
Survival.
Damn
it.
Murph,
don't...?
Panic
won't
help.
We
just
But
isn't
that
exactly
what
Professor
Brand
Brand
gave
up
on
us.
So...
do
you
have
an
idea?
A
feeling.
I
told
you
about
my
ghost.
My
dad
thought
I
called
it
a
ghost...
because
I
was
scared
of
it.
But
I
was
never
scared
of
it.
I
called
it
a
ghost
because
it
felt...
It
felt
like
a
person.
It
was
trying
to
tell
me
something.
If
there's
an
answer
here
on
Earth,
somehow,
in
that
room.
We're
running
out
of
time.
CASE:
COOPER:
No,
they
can
stay.
-
Hey,
Coop?
I
have
a
suggestion
-
Yeah,
what's
that?
I'm
going
home,
Rom.
Yeah,
I
know.
There's
a
chance
for
the
people
on
Earth.
-
Talk
to
me.
-
It's
what
we
call
a
gentle
singularity.
They're
hardly
gentle.
something
crossing
the
horizon
fast
-
What
happens
after
it
crosses?
So,
what's
to
say

glimpse
the
singularity
If
he's
equipped
to
transmit
TARS:
Just
when
did
this
probe
TARS
is
the
obvious
candidate.
I've
already
told
him
what
to
look
for.
I'd
need
the
old
optical
transmitter
You'd
do
this
for
us?
Before
you
get
all
teary,
remember
that
-
Your
cue
light's
broken.
I'm
gonna
need
TARS
to
remove
and
adapt
I
don't
want
to
disturb
I'll
supervise.
All
right.
Dr.
Mann,
we
need
to
find
three
secure
sites.
Once
those
modules
have
landed,
I
can
take
you
to
the
probe
sites,
these
conditions
are
gonna
hold.
COOPER:
CASE
is
headed
down
I'd
really
like
to
secure
Well,
these
squalls
do
usually
blow
over.
Okay,
then.
-
You'll
need
a
long-range
transmitter.
-
Are
you
charged?
Follow
me.
-
TARS,
72
hours,
yeah?
MANN:
Brand
told
me
why
you
feel
But
I'd
be
remiss
that
a
mission
such
as
ours
You
better
slow
down,
turbo.
CASE:
Safety
first,
Cooper.
COOPER:
I
have
to
tell
you,
Dr.
Mann,
But
once
we
set
up
base
camp
and
secure
I'm
going
home.

You
have
attachments.
I
can
promise
you
that
that
yearning
That
emotion
is
at
the
foundation...
of
what
makes
us
human.

-
How
long
have
you
had
that
cough?
COOP:
Mom
lets
me
play
in
here.
I
don't
touch
your
stuff.

Just
take
this
gently.
You
know
why
we
couldn't
just
send
machines
A
machine
doesn't
improvise
well
Our
survival
instinct
is
our
single
Take
you,
for
example.
A

with
a
survival
instinct
What

tell
us
is
the
last

Your

Their

At
the
moment
of
death,
your

For
them.
Deep
breath.
Uh,
hey.
I
bet
you're
Coop.
It's
bad.
They
cannot
stay
here.
-
Okay?
ROMILLY:
TARS,
what's
taking
so
long?
TARS:
Professor,
I
am
having
trouble
I
don't
understand.

It's
funny.
When
I
left
Earth...
I
thought
I
was
prepared
to
die.
The
truth
is...
I
never
really
considered
the
possibility
Nothing
worked
out
the
way
COOPER:
Let's
go.

All
right,
buddy,
What
is
this?
-
What
are
you
doing?
We're
gonna
need
it
once
the
others
realize
We
cannot
survive
here.


-
MURPH:
They
can't
stay
here
anymore.
Let
me
make
something
abundantly
clear.
-
MAN:
Oh!
Jesus!
Dad
didn't
raise
you
Dad
didn't
raise
me,
Grandpa
did.

You
faked
all
the
data?
MANN:
Yeah.
There's
no
surface?
MANN:
No.
I
tried
to
do
my
duty,
Cooper...
but
I
knew
the
day
that
I
arrived
here
And
I
resisted
but
I
knew
that...
if
I
just
pressed
that
button,
then...
somebody
would
come
and
save
me.
You
fucking
coward.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

Listen,
if
you're
not
going
to
go,
And
we
go
live
underground
with
you?
Dad's
not
coming
back.
You're
gonna
save
everybody?
Dad
didn't
even
try!
He
left
us
here
to
die.
Nobody's
going
with
you.
You
gonna
wait
for
your
next
kid
to
die?

Get
out.
And
don't
come
back.
MURPH:
You
can
keep
my
stuff.

Stop
it!
No.
No!
Dr.
Mann,
there's
a
50-50
chance
Those
are
the
best
odds

Don't
judge
me,
Cooper.
You
were
never
tested
like
I
was.
You
tried
your
best,
Murph.
-
You're
feeling
it,
aren't
you?
The
survival
instinct.
That's
what
drove
me.
It's
what
drives
Because
I
want
to
save
all
of
us.
I'm
sorry,
I
can't
watch
you
I
thought
I
could,
but
I
can't.
I'm
here.
I'm
here
for
you.
Just
listen
to
my
voice,
Cooper.
I'm
right
here.
You're
not
alone.
Do
you
see
your

It's
okay.
They're

And
then
we

Dr.

listen

This

There

It

Oh,

No.
We

What

now,
Dr.
Brand.
I'm
sorry,

COOPER:
Once

and
Ranger

rocket
boosters
to...
push
us
out
of
the

AMELIA:
Cooper,

Brand.
It's

They
saved

Yeah?
Who
the

is

I
don't
know,
but
they

their

Yeah,
that
ain't
working.
Yes,
it
is.
You've
seen
that

here
You
have
worked
out
that
you
can
exert
Gravity
to
send
a

Affirmative.
Gravity...
can
cross
the
dimensions,
including
time.
Apparently.
Do
you
have
the
quantum
data?
Roger.
I
have
it.
I
am
transmitting
it
on
all
wavelengths,
I
can
do
this.
I
can
do
this.
But
such
complicated
data
to
a

Not
just
any
child.

What
else?
Oh,
come
on,
Dad.
Murph,
the
fire's
out!
Come
on!
TARS:
Even
if
you
communicate
it
here,
I
get
that,
TARS.
But
we've
got
to
figure
something
out
Cooper...
they
didn't
bring
us
here
Say
that
again.
They
didn't
bring
us
here
No,
they
didn't
bring
us
here
at
all.
We
brought
ourselves.
TARS,
give
me
the
coordinates
In
binary.
Roger.
Feeding
data.
"It's
not
a
ghost."
"It's
gravity."
COOPER:
Don't
you
get
it
yet,
TARS?
I
brought
myself
here!
We're
here
to
communicate
We're
the
bridge!
I
thought
they
chose
me.
-
But
they
didn't
choose
me,
they
chose
her.
To
save
the
world.
All
of
this
is
one
little
girl's
bedroom.
It's
infinitely
complex.
They
have
access
to
infinite
time
and
space,
They
can't
find
a
specific
place
in
time.
That's
why
I'm
here.
just
like
I
found
this
moment.
-
How,
Cooper?
It's
just
like
Brand
said.
My
connection
What
are
we
here
to
do?
Find
how
to
tell
her.
The
watch.
The
watch.
That's
it.
We
code
the
data
into
the
movement
TARS,
translate
the
data
into
Morse
Translating

She
will.
She
will.
MAN:
Murph,
I
can
see
his
car!
He's
coming,
Murph!
Okay.
I'm
coming
down.
TARS:
How
do
you
know?
Because
I
gave
it
to
her.
Roger.
Morse
is
dot-dot-dash-dot.
Dot-dot...
dash-dot.
Dot-dash-dot-dot.
Dot-dash-dot-dot.
Dash-dash-dash.

He
came
back!
It
was
him
all
the
time!
Dad's
gonna
save
us.
Eureka!
It's
traditional.

Eureka!

Did
it
work?
TARS:
I
think
it
might
have.
How
do
you
know?
Because
the
bulk
beings
Don't
you
get
it
yet,
TARS?
They're
not
"beings."
They're
us.
What
I've
been
doing
for
Murph,
For
all
of
us.
Cooper,
people
couldn't
build
this.
No.
No,
not
yet.
But
one
day.
Not
you
and
me.
But
people.
A
civilization
that's
evolved
past
COOPER:
What
happens
now?

MAN:
Mr.
Cooper.
All
right.
Let's
take
it
slow,
sir.
Nice
and
easy,
Mr.
Cooper.
Remember,
you're
no
spring
chicken
anymore.

Take
it
slow,
sir.
You
were,
uh...
extremely
lucky.
The
Rangers
found
you
with
only
minutes

Where
am
I?
Cooper
Station.
Currently
orbiting
Saturn.
Cooper
Station.
Nice
of
you
to
name
it
after
me.

What?
The
station
isn't
named
after
you,
sir.
Although
she's
always
maintained
Is
she
still
alive?
She'll
be
here
in
a
couple
weeks.
She
is
far
too
old
to
be
transferring
but
when
she
heard
well,
this
is,
uh...
Murphy
Cooper
Yes,
it
is.
We'll
have
you
checked
out
of
here
I'm
sure
you'll
be
excited
to
see
I
actually,
uh...
did
a
paper
on
you
I
know
all
about
your
life
Oh,
yeah.
Right.
If...
If
you'll
follow
me,
So,
uh...
when
I
made
my
suggestion
I
was
delighted
to
hear
WOMAN

It
was
just
constant.
Of
course,
MAN
1:
Glasses
or
cups,
Well,
my
dad
was
a
farmer.
There
just
wasn't
enough
food.
WOMAN
2:
of
sheet
over
our
nose
and
mouth
Well,
it
was
pretty
exciting
for
me
MAN
2:
I
don't
care
who
describes
it,
there
is
MAN:
She
did
confirm

Oh,

did,
did
she?

Mr.

Family?
Yeah,
they
all
came
out
to
see
her.
She's

-
You
told
them
I
like
farming.
It
was
me,
Murph.
I
was
your
ghost.
I
know.
People
didn't
believe
me.
But...
I
knew
who
it
was.
Nobody
believed
me.
But
I
knew
you'd
come
back.
How?
Because
my
dad
promised
me.
Well,
I'm
here
now,
Murph.
I'm
here.
No.
No
parent
should
have
to
watch
I
have
my
kids
here
for
me
now.
You
go.
Where?
Brand.
MURPH:
She's
out
there...
setting
up
camp.
Alone...
in
