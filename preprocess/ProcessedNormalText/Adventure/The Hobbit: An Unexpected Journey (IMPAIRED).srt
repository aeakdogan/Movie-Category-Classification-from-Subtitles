THE
HOBBIT
OLD
BILBO
:
My
dear
Frodo.
You
asked
me
once
if
I
had
told
you
adventures.
And
while
I
can
honestly
say
I
may
not
have
told
you
all
of
it.
I
am
old
now
Frodo.
I'm
not
the
same
hobbit
I
once
was.
I
think
it
is
time
for
you
to
know...
what
really
happened.
It
began
long
ago.
In
a
land
far
away
to
the
East.
The
like
of
which
you
will
There
was
the
city
of
Dale.
Its
market's
known
far
and
wide,
peaceful
and
prosperous.
For
this
city
laid
before
the
doors
Erebor.
Stronghold
of
Thrór,
The
mightiest
of
the
dwarf
lords.
Thrór
ruled
with
utter
surety,
for
his
line
lay
secure
and
grandson.
Ah,
Frodo.
Erebor.
Built
deep
within
the
mountain
itself,
the
beauty
of
this
fortress
Its
wealth
lay
in
the
earth,
and
in
great
seams
of
gold
The
skill
of
the
dwarves
was
unequaled.
Fashioning
object
of
great
beauty,
out
of
diamond,
emerald,
Ever
they
delved
deeper
and
that
is
where
they
found
it.
The
heart
of
the
mountain...
The
Arkenstone.
Thrór
named
it
the
king's
jewel.
He
took
it
as
a
sign,
a
sign
All
would
pay
homage
to
him.
But
the
years
of
peace
and
Slowly
the
days
turned
sour,
and
the
watchful
nights
closed
in.
Thrór's
love
of
gold
A
sickness
had
begun
to
grow
within
him.
It
was
a
sickness
of
the
mind.
And
where
sickness
thrives...
bad
things
will
follow.
The
first
they
heard
was
a
noise
like
The
pines
on
the
mountain
creaked
THORIN:
Balin,
sound
the
alarm.
Call
out
the
guards,
do
it
now!
BALIN:
What
is
it?
Dragon.
DRAGON!
OLD
BILBO
:
Smaug...
had
come!
Such
wanton
death
was
dealt
that
day,
for
this
city
of
men
was
nothing
to
Smaug.
His
eye
was
set
on
another
price.
For
dragons
covet
gold...
NO!
Erebor...
was
lost.
For
a
dragon
will
guard
his
plunder
Run
for
your
lives!
Help
us!
Thranduil
would
not
risk
the
lives
of
No
help
came
from
the
Elves
that
day.
Nor
any
day
since.
Robbed
of
their
homeland,
the
dwarves
The
once
mighty
people
brought
low.
The
young
dwarf
prince
took
laboring
in
the
villages
of
men.
But
always,
he
remembered...
the
mountain
smoke
beneath
the
moon,
where
he
had
seen
dragon
fire
in
the
sky,
And
he
never
forgave...
That,
my
dear
Frodo,
is
where
I
come
in.
For
quite
by
chance,
fate
decided
I
would
It
began...
In
a
hole
in
the
ground,
Not
a
nasty,
dirty
wet
hole
This
was
a
hobbit
home.
And
that
means
good
and
all
the
comforts
of
home.
OLD
BILBO:
Thank
you.
FRODO:
What's
this?
That
is
private.
It's
not
ready
yet.
Not
ready
for
what?
Reading.
OLD
BILBO:
What
on
earth
are
these?
FRODO:
Replies
to
the
party
invitations.
Good
gracious.
Is
it
today?
They
all
say
they're
coming,
who're
demanding
you
ask
them
in
person.
OLD
BILBO:
Are
they,
indeed.
They'd
probably
find
that
quite
agreeable.
They
seem
to
think
you
have
tunnels
It
was
one
small
chest,
And
it
still
smells
of
troll.
What
on
earth
are
you
doing?
Taking
precautions!
You
know
I
caught
her
making
off
FRODO:
Who?
OLD
BILBO:
Lobelia
Sackville-Baggins.
She
had
all
my
spoons
Dreadful
woman.
Make
sure
you
keep
an
eye
When
I'm...
when...
When
you're...
what?
It's
nothing...
nothing.
FRODO:
You
know,
some
people
are
They
think
you're
becoming
odd.
–
Odd?
Unsociable.
Unsociable,
me?
Be
a
good
lad
and
put
that
on
the
gate.
Do
you
think
he
will
come?
Who?
Gandalf.
Oh,
he
wouldn't
miss
a
chance
He'll
give
us
quite
a
show,
you'll
see.
FRODO:
Right
then.
I
am
off.
FRODO:
Right
then.
I
am
off.
FRODO:
Eastfarthing
woods.
OLD
BILBO:
Well
go
on
then.
OLD
BILBO:
He
doesn't
approve
being
late.
Not
that
I
ever
was.
In
those
days,
I
was
always
on
time.
I
was
entirely
respectable...
and
nothing
unexpected...
ever
happened.
AN
UNEXPECTED
JOURNEY
–
Good
morning.
Do
you
mean
to
wish
me
a
good
morning,
or
do
you
mean
that
it
is
a
good
Or
perhaps
you
mean
to
say
that
you
or
are
you
simply
stating
that
All
of
them
at
once,
I
suppose.
Can
I
help
you?
It
remains
to
be
seen.
I'm
looking
for
someone
An
adventure?
No,
I
don't
imagine
who'd
have
much
interest
in
adventures.
Nasty,
disturbing...
Make
you
late
for
dinner!
Good
morning!
To
think
that
I
should
have
lived
to
be
as
if
I
was
selling
buttons
at
the
door!
Beg
your
pardon?
You've
changed,
and
not
entirely
I'm
sorry,
do
I
know
you?
Would
you
know
my
name,
although
I'm
Gandalf...
and
Gandalf
means...
me!
Not
Gandalf,
the
wandering
wizard
Old
Took
used
to
have
I
had
no
idea
you
were
still
in
business.
And
where
else
should
I
be?
Well...
Well,
I'm
pleased
to
find
even
if
it's
only
my
fireworks.
So
that's
decided.
It
will
be
very
good
for
you...
and
most
amusing
for
me.
Inform
the
who-
what-
no,
no.
We
do
not
want
any
adventures
here,
I
suggest
you

Good
morning.

your

Hm...
Uh...
Bilbo...
Baggins...
at
yours.
No.
Which
way,
laddie?
Is
it
down
here?
Is
it
down
here?
Supper.
He
said
there'd
be
food.
He-
he
said?
Very
good
dish.
Any
more?
What?
Help
yourself.
It's
just
that,
hum...
I
wasn't
expecting
company.

That
would
be

door.
Balin...

your
service.
Good
evening.
Yes,
yes
it
is.

it
might

later.

I
late?
Late...
for
what?
Ooh!
Ah
ah!
Evening,
brother!

By
my
beard!
You
are
shorter
and
wider
Wider,
not
shorter.
Sharp
enough
for
both
of
us.


Uh...
Excuse
me.
Sorry.
Uh,
but
the
thing
is
I'm

BALIN:
Have
you
eaten?
It-
It's
not
that
I
don't
like
visitors.
I
like
visitors
as
much
as
the
next
hobbit.
But
I
do
like
to
know
them

this?

it

It's
riddled,
but

BILBO:

don't-

don't

to

I
don't
mean
to
be
blunt,
but
I-
Apology
accepted.
BALIN:
Oh
no,
fill
it
up
brother,
don't

BALIN:
I
could
eat
again,

you
insist.

Boggins.
No!
You
can't
come
in,
What's
you-
No
one
told
us.
Can-

No,
nothing's
been
canceled.
That's
a
relief.
Careful
with
these,
It's
nice,
this
place.
Did
you
do
it
yourself?

Well
no,

your
great
great
was
so
large,
he
could
ride
a
real
horse?
Yes,
well
he
could!
In
the
battle
of
Greenfields,
he
swung
his
club
so
hard,
it
knocked
and
it
sailed
a
hundred
yards
through
And
thus
the
battle
as
won...
and
the
game
of
golf
BILBO:
I
do
believe
you
made
that
up.
GANDALF:
Well,
all
good
stories
You'll
have
a
tale
or
two
to
tell
Can
you
promise
that
I
will
come
back?
No...
And
if
you
do...
you'll
not
be
the
same.
That's
what
I
thought.
Sorry,
Gandalf,
I
can't
sign
this.
You've
got
the
wrong
hobbit.
BALIN:
It
appears
we
have
lost
our
burglar.
Probably
for
the
best.
The
odds
were
always
against
us.
After
all,
what
are
we?
Merchants,
minors...
tinkers,
toy
makers.
Hardly
the
stuff
of
legend.
There
are
a
few
warriors
amongst
us.
Old
warriors.
THORIN:
I
would
take
each
and
every
one
of
these
for
when
I
called
upon
them,
Loyalty...
Honor...
A
willing
heart....
I
can
ask
no
more
than
that.
You
don't
have
to
do
this.
You
have
a
choice.
You've
done
honorably
by
our
people.

of
the
day
when
the
dwarves
There
is
no

Balin.
Not
for
me.
BALIN:
Then
we
are
with
you,
laddie.
We
will
see
it
done.

Hello!
PASSERBY:
Hey!
Mr.
Bilbo.
Where're
you
after?
BILBO:
I
can't
stop,
I'm
already
late!
Late
for
what?
I'm
going
on
an
adventure!
BILBO:
Wait!
Wait!
I
signed
it.
BALIN:
Everything
appears
to
be
in
order.
Welcome,
master
Baggins...
in
the
company
of
Thorin
Oakenshield.
THORIN:
Give
him
a

No,
no

pay
up!
A
DWARF:
One
more.
BILBO:
What's
that
about?
GANDALF:
Oh
they
took
wagers...
Most
of
them
bet
that
you
wouldn't.
And
what
did
you
think?
My
dear
fellow...
Oh
it's
horsehair.
Having
a
reaction.
Uh...
Wait,
wait.
Stop!
BILBO:
Stop!
We
have
to
turn
around.
GANDALF:
What
on
earth
is
the
matter?
I
forgot
my
handkerchief.
BOFUR:
Here!
Use
this.
DWALIN:
Move
on!
GANDALF:
You'll
have
to
manage
and
a
good
many
other
before
we
reach
our
journey's
end.
You
were
born
to
the
rolling
hills
But
home
is
now
behind
you.
The
world
is
ahead.


BILBO:
Good
girl!
It's
our
little
secret,
Myrtle,
Just
tell
no
one,
shh
shh...

What
was
that?
Orcs.
Orcs?
FILI:
Throat
cutters.
There'd
be
dozens
of
them
out
there.
The
low
lands
are
crawling
with
them.
KILI:
They
strike,
in
the
wee
small
hours,
Quick
and
quiet,
no
screams.
THORIN:
You
think
that's
funny?
You
think
a
night
raid
by
orcs
is
a
joke?
We
didn't
mean
anything
by
it.
THORIN:
No
you
didn't.
You
know
nothing
of
the
world.
BALIN:
Don't
mind
him,
laddie.
Thorin
has
more
cause
BALIN
:
After
the
dragon
King
Thrór
tried
to
reclaim
BALIN
:
But
our
enemy
Moria
had
been
taken
by
legions
of
orcs,
led
by
the
most
vile
of
all
their
race...
Azog...
the
Defiler.
The
giant
Gundabad
orc
had
sworn
to
wipe
out
the
line
of
Durin.
He
began...
by
beheading
the
king.

NOOOOOO!
BALIN
:
Thráin,
Thorin's
father,
he
went
missing,
taken
prisoner
We
were
leaderless.
Defeat...
and
death...
were
upon
us.
That
is
when...
I
saw
him.
A
young
dwarf
prince
He
stood
alone
against
this
terrible
foe.
His
armor
rent,
wielding
nothing
Azog
the
Defiler
learned
that
day,
that
the
line
of
Durin

Our
forces
rallied,
and
Our
enemy
had
been
defeated...
but
there
was
no
feast,
for
our
dead
were
beyond
We
few,
had
survived...
and
I
thought
to
myself
then...
there
is
one...
who
I
could
follow...
there
is
one...
I
could
call
king.
BILBO:
And
the
Pale
Orc?
What
happened
to
him?
THORIN:
He
slunk
back
into
the
hall
That
filth
died
of
his
wounds
long
ago.

DORI:
There.
Mr.
Gandalf?
Can't
you
do
something
about
this
deluge?
It
is
raining,
master
dwarf.
And
it
will
continue
to
rain
If
you
wish
to
change
you
should
find
yourself
another
wizard.
Are
there
any?
Are
there
any?
–
Other
wizards?
–
Other
wizards?
The
greatest
of
our
order
Then
there
are
the
two
blue
wizards...
D'you
know,
I
have
quite
And
who
is
the
fifth?
Well,
that
would
be
Radagast.
The
Brown.
Is
he
a
great
wizard
or
is
he...
more
like
you?
I
think
he's
a
very
great
wizard...
He's
a
gentle
soul
who
prefers
He
keeps
a
watchful
eye
over
and
a
good
thing
too,
for
always
evil
will

Not
good...
Not
good
at
all!
Hmm...

Oh.
Oh
no...
Sebastian!
Good
gracious.
Move
back,
give
him
some
air,
I
don't
understand
why
it's
not
working,
it's
not
as
if
it's
witchcraft.
Witchcraft...
Oh...
But
it
is!
A
dark
and
powerful...
magic.







Where
on
this
good
earth

The
old
fortress?

Show
me.
THORIN:
We'll
camp
here
for
the
night.
Fíli,
Kíli,
look
after
the
ponies.
Make
sure
you
stay
with
them.
GANDALF:
A
farmer
and
his
family
THORIN:
Óin,
Glóin.
THORIN:
Óin,
Glóin.
Get
the
fire
going.
GANDALF:
I
think
it
would
be
wiser
to
move
on.
We
could
make
for
the
hidden
valley.
THORIN:
But
I've
told
you
already.
I
will
not
go
near
that
place.
GANDALF:
Why
not?
The
Elves
could
help
us,
THORIN:
I
do
not
need
their
advice.
GANDALF:
We
have
a
map
that
we
cannot
read.
THORIN:
Help?
A
dragon
attacks
Erebor.
Orcs
plunder
Moria,
the
Elves
looked
on
and
did
nothing!
You
ask
me
to
seek
out
the
very
people
who
betrayed
my
father.
You
are
neither
of
them.
I
did
not
give
you
that
map
and
key
I
did
not
know
they
were
yours
to
keep.
Everything
alright?
Gandalf,
where
are
you
going?
To
seek
the
company
of
the
only
one
And
who's
that?
And
who's
that?
I've
had
enough
of
dwarves
for
one
day.
Come
on
Bumbur,
we're
hungry.
Is
he
coming
back?
It's
been
a
long
time.
BOFUR:
Who?
BOFUR:
Who?
He's
a
wizard!
He
does
as
he
chooses.
Here.
Do
us
a
favor,
Stop
it,
you've
had
plenty.
What's
the
matter?
KILI:
We're
supposed
to
be
FILI:
Only
we've
encountered
a...
KILI:
We
had
sixteen.
FILI:
Now
there's...
fourteen.
KILI:
Daisy
and
Bungle
are
missing.
BILBO:
What?
Well,
that's...
not
good,
Shouldn't
we
tell
Thorin?
FILI:
Uh,
no.
Let's
not
worry
him.
As
our
official
burglar,
we
thought
BILBO:
Well,
eh...
it
looks
as
if
something
KILI:
That
was
our
thinking.
BILBO:
It's
something
very
big,
KILI:
Hey!
There's
a
light.
Move
here.
Stay
down.
BILBO:
What
is
it?
KILI:
Trolls.

He's
got
Myrtle
and
Minty!
I
think
they're
gonna
eat
them,
KILI:
Yes,
you
should.
Mountain
trolls
are
slow
and
stupid,
and
you're
so
small,
they'll
never
see
you.
We'll
be
right
behind
you.
If
you
run
into
trouble
hoot
twice
like
Twice
like
a
barn
owl,
like

are

He

DWARVES:

TOM:
Don't

'em!
Best
to

BERT:
They
should
be
so
salted

nice.

You

business,
GLOIN:
Parasite,
did

say
parasite?
KILI:
But
we
don't
have
parasites!
You
have
parasites.

GLOIN:
I've

parasites
as
big
as
my

Mine
are

We're

do

Let

You

I
don't

what
you're
up
to.
This
little
ferret...
BILBO:
Ferret?
BILBO:
Ferret?
GANDALF:
The
dawn
will
take
you
all!
–
WILLIAM:
Who's
that?
TOM:
Can
we
eat
him
too?


DWALIN:
Ooh,
get
your
foot
out
of
my
back!
THORIN:
Where
did
you
go
to,
if
I
may
ask?
GANDALF:
To
look
ahead.
THORIN:
What
brought
you
back?
GANDALF:
Looking
behind.
Nasty
business.
Still
they
all
are
in
one
piece.
No
thanks
to
your
burglar.
He
had
the
nose
to
play
for
time.
None
of
the
rest
of
you
thought
of
that.
GANDALF:
They
must
have
come
down
THORIN:
Since
when
the
mountain
trolls
GANDALF:
Oh,
not
for
an
age...
Not
since
a
darker
power
They
could
not
have
moved
in
daylight.
THORIN:
There
must
be
a
cave
nearby.
OFUR:
Oh
what's
that
stench?!
GANDALF:
It's
a
troll
hoard.
Be
careful
what
you
touch.

BOFUR:
Seems
a
shame
just
to
Anyone
could
take
it.
GLOIN:
Agreed.
Nori,
come
here.
Get
a
shovel.
THORIN:
These
swords
were
not
made
by
any
troll.
GANDALF:
Nor
were
they
made
These
were
forged
in
Gondolin...
by
the
High
Elves,
of
the
First
Age.
You
could
not
wish
for
a
finer
blade.
GLOIN:
Kíli,
come,
come.
NORI:
Alright,
come.
GLOIN:
We're
making
a
long-term
deposit.
THORIN:
Let's
get
out
of
this
foul
place.
Come
on,
let's
go.
Bofur,
Glóin,
Nori.
–
GANDALF:
Bilbo.
Here.
This
is
about
your
size.
I
can't
take
this.
The
blade
is
of
Elvish
make,
which
means
it
will
glow
blue
when
I-

I
have
never
used
a
sword
in
my
life.
And
I
hope
you'll
never
have
to.
But
if
you
do,
remember
this:
True
courage...
is
about
knowing
not
when
but
when
to
spare
one.
DWALIN:
Something's
coming!
BILBO:
Gandalf!
GANDALF:
Stay
together.
Hurry,
they're
armed!
Arm
yourselves!
RADAGAST:
Thieves!
Fire!
Murder!
GANDALF:
Radagast.
It's
Radagast
the
Brown!
GANDALF:
What
on
earth
are
you
doing
here?
I
was
looking
for
you,
Gandalf.
Something's
wrong.
Yes?
RADAGAST:
Just
give
me
a
minute,
hm...
No...
I
had
a
thought
and,
it
was
was
right
there,
Oh!
It's
not
a
thought
at
all!
It's
just
only
a...
stick
insect.
RADAGAST:
The
Greenwood
is
sick,
Gandalf.
A
darkness
has
fallen
over
it,
At
least
nothing
good.
The
air
is
foul
of
decay,
but
worse
are
the
webs.
GANDALF:
Webs?
What
do
you
mean?
RADAGAST:
Spiders,
Gandalf.
Some
kind
of
spawn
of...
Ungoliant,
I
followed
their
trail.
They
came
from...
Dol
Guldur.
GANDALF:
Dol
Guldur?
But
the
old
fortress
is
abandoned.
No,
Gandalf.
It
is
not.
RADAGAST
:
such
as
I
have
never
felt
before.
It
is
the
shadow
of
an
ancient
aura.
One
that
can
summon
I
saw
him,
Gandalf.
From
out
of
the
darkness...
the
Necromancer
has
come!
Sorry.
GANDALF:
Try

Then
out.
Now...
the

Are
you
sure?
RADAGAST:
That
is
not...
from
the
world...
of
the
living.

Was
that
a
wolf?
Are
there-
Wolves?
No,
that
is
not
a
wolf.

THORIN:
Warg
scouts!
Which
means
an
orc
pack
is
not
far
behind.
Orc
pack?
Who
did
you
tell
about
No
one.
Who
did
you
tell?
No
one,
I
swear!
What
in
Dorin's
name
is
going
on?
You're
being
hunted.
DWALIN:
We
have
to
get
out
of
here.
ORI:
We
can't!
We
have
no
ponies.
RADAGAST:
I'll
draw
them
off.
GANDALF:
These
are
Gundabad
wargs.
These
are
Rhosgobel
rabbits.
I'd
like
to
see
them
try.

Come
and
get
me!


GANDALF:
Come
on!
Stay
together.
Move!
THORIN:
Ori,
no!
Come
back.
All
of
you,
come
on,
THORIN:
Where're
you
leading
us?
GANDALF:
Move!

GLOIN:
There
they
are!

This

there's

DWALIN:
I
cannot
see
where
the
pathway
leads.
Do
we
follow
it
or
no?
BOFUR:
We
follow
it,
of
course!
GANDALF:
I
think
that
would
be
wise.
The

of
Imladris.
In

Of

I

Not

Where

Strange

Something
or
someone
has
drawn

GANDALF:
Ah,
that
may
have
been
us.
Welcome
Thorin,
son
of
Thráin.
I
do
not
believe
we
have
met.
You
have
your
Grandfather's
bearing.
I
knew
Thrór
when
he
ruled
Indeed?
He
made
no
mention
of
you.

GLOIN:
What
is
he
saying?
No
Master
Glóin,
he's
offering
you
food.
Ah
Well...
In
that

lead
on.
Try
it.
Just
a
mouthful.
I
don't
like

Where's
the
meat?
Have

got
any
chips?
GANDALF:
Kind
of

to
invite

Well,
you
never
are.
ELROND:
This
is
Orcrist...
the
Goblin-cleaver.
A
famous
blade,
forged
by
My
kin.
May
it
serve
you
well.
And
this
is

ELROND:
How
did
you
come
with
these?
GANDALF:
We
found
them
in
a

before
we
were
ambushed
by
orcs.
And
what
were
you
doing
THORIN:
Our
business
is
no

of

GANDALF:
For
goodness
sake.
THORIN:
It
is
the
legacy
of
my
people.
It's
mine
to
protect!
As
are
its
secrets.

To

Lord

had
sent
for
you.
SARUMAN:
He
didn't.
I
did.
Saruman.
You've
been
busy
of
late,
my
friend.
Tell
me,
Gandalf...
Did
you
think
these
plans
and
schemes
GANDALF:
Unnoticed?
No,
I...
I'm
simply
doing
what
I
feel
to
be
right.
Galadriel:
The
dragon...
GANDALF:
It
is
true,
my
Lady.
Smaug
owes
allegiance
to
no
one.
But
if
he
should
side
with
the
enemy,
the
dragon
could
be
used
SARUMAN:
What
enemy?
Gandalf,
the
enemy
is
defeated.
Sauron
is
vanquished.
He
can
never
regain
his
full
strength.
Gandalf...
for
four
hundred
years,
a
hard
won
watchful
peace!
GANDALF:
Are
we-
are
we
at
peace?
Trolls
have
come
down
from
the
mountains,
they
are
raiding
villages,
Orcs
have
attacked
us
on
the
road.
ELROND:
Hardly
a
prelude
to
war.
SARUMAN:
Always
you
must
meddle.
Looking
for
trouble
where
none
exist!
GALADRIEL:
Let
him
speak.
GANDALF:
There
is
something
at
work
something
far
more
powerful.
We
can
remain
blind
to
it,
but
it
will
not
A
sickness
hides
over
the
Greenwood.
The
woodsmen
who
live
there
now
call
it
SARUMAN:
Well,
don't
stop
now,
GANDALF:
They
speak
of
a
Necromancer,
a
sorcerer
who
would
summon
the
dead.
SARUMAN:
That's
absurd.
No
such
power
exists
in
this
world.
This...
Necromancer
is
A
conjurer
dabbling
in
black
magic.
GANDALF:
And
so
I
though
too.
But...
Radagast
has
seen-
Radagast
has
seen-
Do
not
speak
to
me
of
Radagast
the
Brown.
He's
a
foolish
fellow.
Well...
he's
odd,
I
grant
you,
SARUMAN:
It's
not
that.
It's
his
excessive
They've
addled
his
brain,
I
warned
him.
It
is
unbefitting
one
of
GALADRIEL
:
You
carry
something.
It
came
to
you
from
Radagast...
He
found
it
in
Dul
Guldur...
GANDALF:
Yes.
GALADRIEL:
Show
me.

What
is
that?
GALADRIEL:
A
relic
of
Mordor.
ELROND:
A
Morgul
blade...
GALADRIEL:
Made
for
the
witch-king
of
Angmar,
and
buried
with
him.
When
Angmar
fell,
the
men
of
the
North
took
his
body,
and
all
that
he
possessed
was
sealed
Deep
within
the
rock,
they
buried
him...
in
a
tomb
so
dark...
it
couldn't
have
come
to
light.
ELROND:
This
is
not
possible.
A
powerful
spell
lies
upon
those
tombs,
SARUMAN:
What
proof
do
we
have
GANDALF:
I
have
none.
SARUMAN:
Because
there
is
none.
Let
us
examine
what
we
know.
A
single
orc
pack
has
dared
A
dagger
from
a
by-gone
And
a
human
sorcerer
has
taken
up
residence
It's
not
so
very
much,
after
all.
The
question
of
this
dwarvish
company
I'm
not
convinced,
Gandalf.
I
do
not
feel
I
can
condone
such
a
quest.
If
they
come
to
me,
I
might
just
I
will
not
pretend
to
understand
GALADRIEL
:
They
are
leaving.

GANDALF:
Yes.
GALADRIEL:
You
knew.

SARUMAN:
..
I'm
afraid
LINDIR:
My
Lord
Elrond.
The
dwarves...
they've
gone.
THORIN:
Be
on
your
guard,
we're
about
to
step
over
Balin,
you
know
this
path,
lead
on.
BALIN:
Ah
Aye.
THORIN:
Master
Baggins,
I
suggest
you
keep
up.
GALADRIEL
:
You
will
follow
them.
GANDALF:
Yes.
GALADRIEL:
You
are
right
But
I
fear
this
quest
has
set
in
motion
The
riddle
of
the
Morgul
Something
moves
in
the
shadows,
unseen,
hidden
from
our
side,
not
yet.
But
every
day
it
grows
in
strength.
You
must
be
careful.
GANDALF:
Yes...
GALADRIEL:
Mithrandir.
Why
the
Halfling?
GANDALF:
I
don't
know.
Saruman
believes
that
it
is
only
a
great
but
that
is
not
what
I
have
found.
I
found
it
is...
the
small
things,
everyday
deeds
of
ordinary
folk,
that
keep
the
darkness
at
bay...
simple
acts
of
kindness
and
love.
Why
Bilbo
Baggins?
Perhaps
it
is
because
I
am
afraid...
and
he
gives
me
courage.
GALADRIEL:
Do
not
be
afraid,
Mithrandir.
You
are
not
alone.

Alright,
hold
on!

THORIN:

must
find
shelter!

My
turn.
Voiceless

cries,
Wingless
flutters,
Toothless
bites,
Mouthless
mutters.

Just

A
box
without
hinges,
key,
or...
or
lid,
yet
golden
treasure
inside
is
hid.

BILBO:
Well?
GOLLUM:
It's
nasty.
BILBO:
D'you

up?
GOLLUM:
Oh,

GOLLUM:

you.
All

devours,
Birds,
beasts,
trees,
flowers,
Gnaws
iron,
bites
steel,
Grinds
hard
stones
to
meal.
Answer

BILBO:
Give
me
a
moment,
please,

I
don't
know
this
one.
GOLLUM:
Is
it
tasty?
Is
it
scrumptious?
Is
it
crunchable!
BILBO:
Let
me
think!
Let
me
think.
GOLLUM:
It's
stuck!
Bagginses...
ss
stuck.
Time's
up.
BILBO:
Time?
Ti-
The
answer...
is
Time.

Actually,
it
wasn't
that
hard.
GOLLUM:
Last
question...
Last
chance...
BILBO:
Okay...
uh...
GOLLUM:
Ask
us...
Ask

BILBO:

pocket?
GOLLUM:

us
another
one.
BILBO:
No.
No

You

me
a
question.
Well

is...
my
question:
What

GOLLUM:

guesses,

BILBO:
Wrong,

Last

GOLLUM:

Or

BILBO:
Two
guesses
at
once.
Wrong

times.

BILBOO:
So...
Come

GOLLUM:

Did

Oh

BOFUR:
Oh,
that
could
have
been
worse.
DWALIN:
You've
got
to
be
joking!
THORIN:

There's

GANDALF:
Only

Where's
Bilbo?
Where
is
your
hobbit?
Where
is
our
hobbit?
GLOIN:
Curse
that
Halfling!
Now
he's
lost?
DORI:
Don't
blame
me!
GANDALF:
And
where
did
you
last
see
him?
BIFUR:
I
think
I
saw
him
slip
away
GANDALF:
And
what
happened
exactly?
THORIN:
I'll
tell
you
what
happened.
Master
Baggins
saw
He's
thought
of
nothing
but
his
since
first
he
stepped
out
of
his
door.
We
will
not
be
seeing
our
hobbit
again.
He
is
long
gone.
BILBO:
No...
he
isn't.
GANDALF:
Bilbo
Baggins...
I've
never
been
so
glad
KILI:
Bilbo...
We'd
given
you
up!
How
on
earth
did
you
get
past
the
goblins?
DWALIN:
How
indeed?
Oh,
why
does
it
matter?
He's
back.
It
matters.
I
want
to
know...
why
did
you
come
back?
I
know
you
doubt
me.
And
you're
right,
I
miss
my
books...
and
my
arm
chair,
and
my
garden.
See,
that's
where
I
belong.
That's
home.
And
that's
why
I
came
back,
cause...
you
don't
have
one.
It
was
taken
from
you.
But
I
will
help
you
take
it
back
if
I
can.

Out
of
the
frying
pan.
And
into
the
fire.
Run.
Run!
GANDALF:
Up
into
the
trees.
All
of
you!
Come
on,
climb,
THORIN:
They're
coming!
THORIN:
Azog!
It
cannot
be...
GANDALF:
Fíli!
GANDALF:
No!
Aah
no!
Oh
no!
DORI:
Mister
Gandalf!
ORI:
Hold

Nori!

BALIN:
Nooo!
DWALIN:
Thorin!
No!
BOFUR:
Thorin!
GANDALF:
Thorin!
Thorin.
The
halfling?
It's
alright.
Bilbo
is
here.
THORIN:
You!
What
were
you
doing?
You
know
you
could've
yourself
killed?
Did
I
not
say
that
you
would
be
a
burden?
That
you
would
not
survive
in
the
wild...
and
you
had
no
place
amongst
us.
I
have
never
been
so
wrong,
Well,
I'm
sorry
I
doubted
you.
BILBO:
No,
I-

I
would
have
doubted
me
too.
I'm
not
a
hero...
nor
a
warrior.
Not
even
a
burglar.
BILBO:
What's
that?
GANDALF:
Erebor!
The
Lonely
Mountain.
The
last
of
the
Great
Dwarf
THORIN:
Our
home.
OIN:
A
raven!
The
birds
are
returning
to
the
mountain.
GANDALF:
That,
my
dear
Óin,
is
a
thrush.
THORIN:
We
will
take
it
as
a
sign...
BILBO:
You're
right.
I
do
believe
the
worst
is
behind
us.
