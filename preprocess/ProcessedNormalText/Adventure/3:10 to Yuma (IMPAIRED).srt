Dad...
Maybe
it's

No!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
You
have
a
week,
Evans.
Then
we'll
burn
the
house.
William
William!
God
damn
it,
William!
God
damn
it!
Put
that
down!
Let
go!
It's
the
last
feed
we've
got
I'll
take
care
of
this
No,
you
won't
Herd's
over
the
ridge
by
now.
You
lied
to
me,
Dan
You
told
me
we
made
payments
to
Hollander.
So,
how
do
you
think
we
bought
feed,
Alice.
I
had
a
choice
between
our
family
and
paying
them
down
We're
supposed
to
make
decisions
together
Would
you
have
made
anything
different?
Alice,
we
can't
make
it
rain
together
We
can't
stop
Hollander
from
selling
It's
too
bad
the
doctors
at
the
aid
station
didn't
take
much
of
my
leg.
Stop
looking
at
me
like
that
Are
you
going
to
tell
the
Marshal
what
those
men
did?
Marshal
ain't
doing
shit
First
thing,
Mark.
I'm
going
to
take
you
boys.
What
are
you
going
to
do
there?
I'm
going
to
tell
Hollander
to
make
this
right
I'm
going
to
tell
him
to
pay
for
a
new
barn.
Maybe
we
should
just
shoot
him
like
Will
says.
Coach

headed
for
Bigsby,

Girded
with
iron,

on
top,

You
should
have
let
me
save
the
feed
Ar
you
going
to
hock
that?
Some
day,
William,
...
...
when
you
walk
in
my
shoes
you
might
understand.
I
ain't
never
walking
in
your
shoes.
Tracks

Here
we
go.
Giddy
up!!
Go

the
Gatling
Mark,
stay

Down

I
think
they
will
not
follow
us
anymore.
Pull

Pull

Good
morning,
Pinkerton
Name's
Charlie
Prince,
Well,
I
heard
about
a
Is
that

missy?
I
hate
Pinkertons
Byron
McElroy
When
did
your
hair
turn
gray,
Byron?
Go
to
hell,
Ben
Wade.
Well,
will
you
look
at
all
this.
I've
got
to
say,
thought.
If
you
are
going
to
kill
me,
I
ain't
going
to
kill
you
Not
like
this
It
won't
change
a
thing,
I'll
come
for
you.
I'd
be
disappointed
if
you
didn't
She's
lit
Let's
go.
There
we
go
I'm
going
to
ask
you
to
put
down
the
money.
Not
a
smart
move,
friend
Shit
He's
fast
Well,
Tommy.
It
seems
that
there
was
Now,
I
know
what
Charlie
told
you,
This
is
what
happens
when
you
put
us
all
at
risk
Mark,
look
at
me.
Keep
looking
at
me.
William,
look
at
me.
Good
morning.
Those
are
my
cattle.
Carefully
rancher.
That's
Ben
Wades
I
need
them
back.
They
are
all
that
I've
got
I
don't
need
your
cattle,
So
you
don't
go
doing
nohing...,
Foolish
Take
the
horse.
Find
them
on
the
road
to
Bigsby.
They're
probably
just
running
late,
Mr.
Butterfield
Pinkertons
don't
run
late.
Get
me
on
my
feet.
-I
think
you're
in
pretty
bad
shape,
Mr....
Mark,
Williams,
get
me
some
of
them
boards
Can
I
help
you
?
I
think
maybe
a
coach
headed
for
here
God
damn
it
By
Mr
Ben
Wade
himself
How
did
you
know
it
was
Wade?
It's
been
him
the
last
21
times,
Marshal
I
saw
a
Mexican
sharpshooter
and
an
Apache
God
Damn
it
-Did
you
see
the
hand
of
God
?
-His
pistol
They
had
a
lot
of
weapons,
Mr..
Let's
go,
we're
wasting
time
Where
are
you
from
anyway?
Tom
Conrad
bought
1000
heads
in
Mexico,
Let's
go
Hmmm.
Something
is
going
on
with
the
railroad
man
Madame,
some
whisky
for
my
friends.
Let's
go
,
the
bar
is
closed.
Here's
to
the
4
that
we
lost
in
battle.
And
here's
to
the
boss
who
had
to
say
good-bye
to
And
that's
too
bad.
Proverbs
13:3
"He

Campos.
Jackson.
Kinter.
Marshal
is
only
half
stupid.
They're
going
across
the
border.
I'll
wait
for
you.
Allright
Charlie.
I've
seen
you
someplace
before
Have
you?
You
ever
worked
for
a
blind
irishman
in
Leadville?
I
was
a
singer.
What
made
you
to
quit?
I
got
to
coughing
You
know,
I
spent
more
money
Do
you
remember
a
girl?
Nobody
forgets
Velvet
You
look
kind
of
skinny.
I
feel
skinny.
It's
allright.
I
don't
mind
skinny
girls
Have
you
got
green
eyes?
That's
right,
they

be
green.
Do
you
think
they
lied?

dont
need
our
shit
horses.
I'll
take
him
into
town
on
my
own
You
boys
go
round
up
the
herd.
Mr,
we're
going
to
have
to
lift
you
up
Here
comes
the
cavalry.
Do
as
I
said
Is
he
from
the
coach?
The
only
one
that
made
it
-Mr.
McElroy,
can
you
hear
me?
Can
you
hear
me?
This
man
needs
attention.
Did
you
see
which
way
they
rode,
Evans?
It
seemed
like
they
were
headed
to
Bigsby
You
know,
there
is
a
little
town
just
south
of
the
border
Pretty
little
pueblo

Folks
would
pay
good
money
to
hear
Yeah,
imagine
me

down
to
Mexico
with
Ben
Wade
on
my
arm
I'm
not
wanted
in
Mexico.
You're
crazy.
-Are
you
the
Dr?
-Coach
got
held
up
What's
his
name?
Byron
McElroy,
he's
a
bounty
hunter
You've
lost
a
lot
of
blood,
Mr
McElroy
-That
bullet
is
still
in
there
Allright.
What
I'm
about
to
do
It
ain't
the
first
time
I've
been
shot
Hold
him,
please
Don't
touch
me.
-
What
the
fuck
kind
of
Doctor
are
you
anyway?
What
the
hell
are
they
looking
for?
Ben
Wade
He
held
up
the
payroll
coach
-I
want
to
talk,
Mr.
Hollander.
Shit,
we're
moving
up
Mr.
Hollander.
Tucker,
I'm
going
to
the
saloon
You've
got
no
right
to
do
what
you've
done
It's
my
land
Come
next
week
it's
not,
Evans
But
you
damn
up
my
creek.
Before
water
touches
your
land
it
resides
and
flows
on
mine.
Here,
if
you
just
give
me
till
spring
I
can
turn
the
corner
Sometimes
a
man
has
to
big
enough
Railroad
is
coming,
Dan
Hollander!
You
look
a
little
bent,
rancher.
Dan,
would
you
like
a
drink?
No
thanks.
You
got
your
horses
back,
didn't
you?
Yeah,
I
got
my
horses
back,
Hell,
they
died
for
a
good
cause.
You
know,
them
beasts
of
yours
I'll
tell
you
what.
That
should
cover
it
How
much
do
you
get
for
a
day's
work?
2
dollars,
when
I
hire
out
There
are
2
dollars
for
a
half-day.
You
took
up
my
boys'
time
too
You're
right,
I
did
Anything
else
you
want
to
get
paid
for,
Dan?
Give
me
5
dollars
extra.
And
what's
that
for?
For
making
me
nervous
Hands
up,
Ben
Wade.
Boss!
-Give
me
your
hands,
Mr.
Wade
Ben
Wade
Captured
in
Bigsby
Be
careful
with
that
thing
Laugh
while
you
can.
Crawley,
go
get
the
wagon.
I'll
meet
you
up
front
of
the
office.
-Get
him
out
of
here.
I
think
we
should
shoot
him
right
now
Put
a
bullet
right
in
his
nogging
If
you
do
that,
everybody
in
this
22
robberies,
The
Southern
Pacific
will
have
Ben
Wade
...in
public,
an
example
made
And
we
will
pay
to
make
it
happen
You
all
notice
he
didn't
mention
of
the
lives
I've
taken
I
need
three
more
men.
-You
can
have
Tucker.
I'm
coming,
you
only
need
one
You're
wounded,
Mr.
McElroy.
I
rode
in
here.
Sure
as
hell
I
can
ride
out
-He
goes,
Potter's
coming
Doc
can't
shoot
shit
I
was
better
shot
of
my
regiment.
I'll
come
For
200
dollars.
You
fight
for
the
north
or
the
south?
North.
We
are
southern
in
name,
200
dollars.
Let's
go
-Thank
you
This
town
is
going
to
burn!
Let's
get
him,
boys!
Get
in
the
coach
God
Damn
it.
Head
for
Evans'
ranch
How
long
does
he
have
to
be
here?
A
day
or
so.
Make
sure
his
outfit
takes
the
bait
Hello
there.
Evans
Whatever
your
wife
is
cooking
in
there,
smells
good,
Evans
Let's
go.
Good
driving,
Marshal
Remind
me
not
to
play
poker
in
this
town
Well,
Marshal,
give
us
a
count
1...
2...
3...
Gonna
check
on
my
family
when
you
come
back,
right?
First
thing
Madam
Byron,
an
unpleasant
surprise
What
happens
if
they
catch
the
wagon?
Well,
you
saw
where
his
man
was.
He's
still
got
to
go
fish
the
outfit.
His
gang
can't
do
anything
in
front
of
the
whole
sixth
cavarly
Did
you
have
something
to
do
with
that?
I
hope
you
are
proud
of
yourself
Just
doing
my
job,
Doc.
Thanks,
son
We
always
wait
to
say
grace
We
don't
presume
to
teach
other
people
manners
Aren't
we
supposed
to
say
grace
for
murderers
too?
-Grace
is
for
everyone,
dear
Mark,
I'd
like
to
hear
it.
God,
our
father,
Lord
and
Savior
Please
bless
this
drink
and
food
we
pray
Amen.
Amen.
If
my
pa'
wanted
to,
he
could
shoot
you
dead
Shooting
an
animal
is
a
lot
different
Not,
it
isn't
We
can
ask
Byron
here.
Not
a
soul
I've
taken
that
didn't
deserve
what
they've
got
"Every
way
of
a
man
is
right
in
his
own
eyes",

Dan
You
eat
more
when
you're
nervous,
Mr
Butterfield?
Why,
thank
you,
Dan.
Could
you
cut
that
for
me?
Allright.
And
the

Do
you
mind
if
I
ask
you
how
you
got
Don't
tell
him
nothing,
Mr
Evans.
Where
were
you
stationed?
7th
company
of
sharpshooters,
out
of

Massachusetts
My
father
was
defending
the
US
capital
Isn't
that
so?
Did
they
shoot
it
off?
Cut
it
off?
I
saw
something
over
there
in
the
grass.
There
ain't
nothing
What
if
they
caught
up
with
the
coach
already?
Have
you
ever
been
to
San
Francisco?
If
it's
all
right
by
you,
Mr.
Wade,
So
you've
never
been
in
San
Francisco?
No.
I
know
a
girl
there.
She
had
the
most
beautiful
green
eyes
The
greenest
eyes
Like
yours.
When
I
stared
deep
into
them
All
the
colors
of
the
sea.
What
did
you
say
your
name
was
again?
Alice.
For
God's
sake,
he's
killed
more
men
than
the

He
is
not
what
I
expected
He
is
dangerous
I
don't
want
you
or
the
boys
You
can
change
your
mind,
Dan
None
can
think
less
of
me
6
months
from
now,
everything
is
going
to
be
great
Cows
are
going
to
be
fat
We
might
even
see
the
steam
We
will
be
allright,
but
we
won't
make
it
through
Sorry,
Dan.
McElroy
says
5
minutes
Do
you
think
it's
too
much
for
me?
He's
a
killer,
Daniel.
Yet
somehow
I
have
the
decency
What
are
you
thinking?
I
am
not
out
there
alone
Ben
Wade
has
a
gang
If
I
don't
go,
we
have
to
pack
up
and
leave
Now,
I
am
tired,
Alice
...
I'm
tired
of
the
way
they
look
at
me
I've
been
standing
on
one
leg
for
3
damned
years,
And
he
ain't
listening
Mr.
Evans.
No,
no,
no.
This
is
my
horse
now
Come
over
here
-Don't
give
me
any
trouble,
Mark
Boy.
-I
want
to
come
with
you
I
can
help.
You're
14
years
old.
I
can
ride
faster
and
The
Pinkerton
is
hurt,
Potter
is
no
good,
I
dont
have
time
to
argue
That's
that
So,
boys,
where
are
we
headed?
It
ain't
none
of
your
business
where
we
are
headed,
Wade.
Do
you
understand
that?
We're
taking
you
to
Contention
You
shouldn't
have
told
him,
now.
Relax,
friend.
Now
if
we
get
separated
I'd
like
tol
thank
you
for
your
hospitality,
Madame
What
did
Ben
Wade
mean
about
Ben
Wade
don't
have
to
lift
a
finger,
Your
father
can
take
care
of
himself
So,
were
you
conscripted
into
Lincoln's
army,
Mr.
Evans?
Neither...
Maybe
both.
What
does
that
means?
It
means
I
was
a
volunteer
for
the
Massachusetts
State
Guard
-To
protect
Washinton.
What
are
you
doing
out
here,
Dan?
You
are
not
a
law
man,
Not
a
Pinkerton
Maybe
I
don't
like
the
idea
of
It's
man's
nature
It's
how
we
are
born
Well,
I
make
an
honest
living
It
might
be
honest,
but
I
don't
think
it's
much
of
a
living
you
must
be
hurting
bad
for
money
Go
to
sleep.
I
imagine
debt
puts
Are
you
married?
We
can't
all
be
cutthroats
and
thieves
Well,
I
know
that
if
I
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
wife
I'd
feed
her
better,
I'd
buy
her
pretty
dresses.
Yeah,
I'd
bet
Alice
was
a
real
pretty
girl
before
she
married
you...
Don't
talk
about
my
wife.
You
shut
up
about
her.
I'd
like
the
sight
of
it
if
you
did.
Mr.
Evans.
It's
my
watch,
now
#Gonna
hang
me
in
the
morning
#Gonna
hang
me
in
the
morning
I
suppose
it's
too
much
to
ask
for
a
little
quiet.
The
way
I
figured
it:
I'd
be
asleep
in
my
So
if
I've
got
to
be
up,
Ben
Wade.
Son
of
a
bitch!
Enough.
-Enough!
We
have
to
bury
him.
If
you
take
the
time
to
dig
one
grave
Let's
go.
#Gonna
hang
me
in
the
morning
#I'll
never
see
the
sun
Don't
worry
there,
Boss
Wait!
Sutherland.
Jackson
No,
No.
Don't
do
this.
Where
is
he?
Open
the
door.
Open
the
door!
Where
did
they
take
him?
I
don't
know!
Mr.,
you'd
better
tell
me
where
they
took
him...
...or
you
will
burn
Contention!
They're
going
to
Contention
They're
going
to
put
him
on
the
Let
me
go
out
of
here!
Contention
is...
80
miles
They've
just
about
killed
our
horses
So,
we'll
buy
new
ones.
Charlie,
it's
his
own
fault
he
got
caught
You
think
you
can
do
a
better
job
Maybe...
You've
forgotten
what
he
We're
going
to
Contention!
Can't
say
I
didn't
warn
you
There's
a
shortcut
we
can
take
A
shortcut?
Through
the
pass
It
takes
you
right
through
Contention
Why
didnt
you
say
something
before?
It's
Apache
country
-I
thought
that
the
government
gave
them
land.
-I
wouldn't
take
that
path
-That's
right
Mr..
Butterfield,
the
Apache
who
lived
They
enjoy
killing
You
ain't
going
to
make
it
We'll
take
our
chances
Something
on
your
mind,
Dan?
Why
did
you
kill
Tucker?
Why
not
me?
Or
Butterfield?
Hell,
Tucker
took
my
horse.
Did
you
liked
him,
Dan?
He
told
me
he
burned
down
your
barn
He
was
an
asshole
But
wishing
him
dead
and
Your
conscience
is
sensitive,
Dan
I
don't
think
it's

Mr.
Wade.
If

to

don't
like
talking
to

Not
when

No,

ain't
it.
Laugh
it
up,

need
Byron
acts
pius.
A
few
years
ago
when
I've
seen
him
and
a
bunch
of
brother
Pinks
...
...
mow
down
32
Apache
women
and
children
Renegades.
Gunning
down
railroad
men
and
their
families
...
...
picking
them
off
the
road,
one
by
one.
Scalped.
There
was
young'nes
running
around.
...
and
his
boys
shot
them
all
Some
of
them
were
still
crying
I
guess
Byron
figured
that
Jesus
Apparently
Jesus
don't
like
the
Apache
Keep
on
talking...
All
the
way
to
Yuma.
Right
up
on
them
steps
Yeah,
the
day
I
die,
Byron
I'm
getting
sprung
from
hell
I
might
feel
the
same,
if
I'd
come
from
the
seed
of
a
Drop
it,
Dan
Evans.
Toss
it
to
the
ground,
Doc
Mr.
Butterfield...
I
believe,
Dan,
you're
carrying
a
pistol
as
well.
Now,
I've
always
liked
you,
Byron,
...
...,
but
you
never
knew
when
to
shut
up
Even
bad
men
love
their
mommas
Now
I
think
it's
time
Don't
you
move,
Mr.
Wade.
Let
go
of
that
shotgun.
William,
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
I
don't
think
that
you're
going
to
shoot
a
man

Dan,
tell
your
boy
it's
over
You
think
you
can
keep
you
gun
on
him,
William?
I'm
doing
a
damn
sight
better
than
you
did
You
ever
been
to
Dodge
City?
No.
Stop
talking
to
him
The
way
you're
shuffling
those
cards,
I
practice
a
lot.
I
can
tell
You
ever
been
to
Dodge?
Yes,
indeed
Meanest,
most
beautiful,
dirty
city
there
ever
was
Saloons
just
overflowing
with
cattle
drivers
and
road
agents,
Women
will
do
things
to
you
you'll
never
forget.
They'll
give
you
disease
you'll
never
forget
Money
in
your
pocket
in
Dodge
City
Everything
a
man
comes
to
need
I
got

I
was
a
boy
not
much
bigger
than
you
Now,
how
many
men
have
you
killed
since
then,
Wade?
How
many
families
have
you
destroyed?
Quite
a
few
Is
it
true
that
you
dynamited
a
wagon
No,
that's
a
lie.
It
was
a
train
full
,
Dan
I
gotta
take
a
piss
You
know,
I
thought
he
was
going
to
I
really
thought
he
was
going
to
do
it
There
was
a
wildness
in
his
eyes.
He's
going
to
be
nothing
like
you,
Wade
A
man's
got
to
have
a
head
start
Yeah,
that's
why
I
don't
mess
around
Dou
do
one
good
deed
for
somebody...
I
imagine
it's
habit
forming
Something
decent.
See
that
grateful
...
I
imagine
it
makes
feel
like
christ
hisself
I've
had
enough
of
this,
Wade.
It's
three
of
them
If
they
were
mine,
you'd
be
dead
Give
me
that
gun,
Wade!
I
told
you
not
to
come
this
way
It
was
McElroy's
decision.
I
told
you
there'd
be
trouble
Give
me
the
keys
to
the
handcuffs
Easy.
Easy
now
Where
is
he?
He's
gone
He
took
the
horses
with
him.
That's
the
quickest
way
out
of
the
pass
We
are
going
after
him.
There
ain't
no
reward
for
getting
him
I've
got
to
be
honest
with
you,
As
for
wanting
$40
a
month
now,
Hello,
Love.
God
damned
Coolies.
They'll
work
just
fine
Well,
if
I
could
teach
a
monkey
Well.
What
we
need
here
are
some
negros
Show
these
Chinamen
what
real
work
is
Holly
Christ!
Who
is
that?
That's
him!
-Help
me
with
the
handcuffs
Break
the
chain.
I
have
5
guns
on
you
out
here,
Ben
Wade
Just
come
on
out!
The
horses.
What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
Mr.
Butterfield,
all
finished
in
Bigsby?
Mr.
Boles
You'd
better
hurry.
We're
making
the
last
blasts
That's
my
prisoner.
We're
taking
him
to
Contention,
What
prisoner?
Come
now,
Mr.
Boles.
That's
Ben
Wade
gunned
down
my
kid
brother,
...
...
in
front
of
me,
6
years
ago
in
Abeline
Your
brother
was
a
lying

card
shark
That
is,
if
he
is
the
asshole
I
remember.
You
can't
do
that.
That's
immoral.
Immoral
ain't
got
a
damned
thing
to
do
with
it
I
was
expecting
to
collect
a
$200
reward
for
that
man.
I'm
delivering
him
to
Contention,
Need
it
bad
enough
to
die?
At
least
let
us
take
our
horses.
I've
got
no
problem
with
that
As
long
as
you
ride
away,
Mr.
Nice
knowing
you,
Dan
God
damn
it!
Did
we
make
it?
Yeah,
Doc.
We
did
Thanks
to
you.
We
need
a
place
to
lay
low.
Keep
him
There
is
a
hotel
up
here,
I'll
check
to
see,
Hey,
Will.
You
keep
a
watch
on
the
rail
head
I'll
let
you
know
William!
There's
a
Can-Can
on
the
outs,
if
you're
interested...
It's
the
Bridal
Suite,
Well,
well.
That
looks
like
rain
clouds
over
Bigsby
You
still
need
that
$200,
Dan?
Shut
up
Mr..
Evans,
you
continue
to
give
I'm
going
to
see
about
the
Marshal.
We're
looking
for
a
group
escorting
Yeah,
we've
been
chasing
them
Who
you
are?
What's
it
to
you?
Ben
Wade
killed
my
brother.
Then
your
brother
must
be
famous
Are
you,
boys,
some
kind
of
posse?
I
hate
posses
So
this
is
the
Bridal
Suite.
Now,
I
wonder
how
many
brides
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
$200
now,
Dan?
Now
that
the
rains
are
coming
I
owe
people
money,
Wade.
What
do
you
think
about
double
that
amount?
You
can
pay
your
debts,
Build
a
new
barn
How
do
you
reckon
I'm
going
to
do
that?
Just
lay
down
your
gun
Is
that
what
you
reckon
my
price
is?
No...
No,
I
reckon
it's
a
thousand
There
was
ten
times
that
amount
Do
you
want
my
cut,
Dan?
Isn't
that
kind
of
reckless
of
you
Wade?
Seeing
that...
Hmmm.
You're
so
sure
that
Oh,
they're
coming,
Dan
Sure
as
God's
vengeance,
they're
coming
But
I
just
like
to
do
things
easy
Imagine
what
you
can
do
with
$1000,
Dan?
You
can
hire
a
couple
of
ranch
hands.
What
about
Alice?
She
wouuld
be
the
proud
wife
All
you've
got
to
do
is
say
yes
Will
you
give
me
a
bank
note,
Wade?
Cash.
You
tell
me,
Wade.
How
will
I
What
will
I
tell
people
when
I
spend
it?
That
you
got
the
jump
on
me,
you
escaped,
No.
How
dumb
do
you
think
people
are?
Nobody
needs
to
know
Do
you
know
what?
Would
you
do
me
a
favor?
Don't
talk
to
me
for
a
while.
You
mean
No.
No,
we're
not
Come
5
minutes
to
3,
we're
going
to
be
#They're
gonna
hang
me
in
the
morning
#For
the
night
is
done
#They're
gonna
hang
me
in
the
morning
#I'll
never
see
the
sun
Who
is
it?
It's
me,
Dan
I
brought
help
You've
been
gone
for
a
long
time,
Mr.
Butterfield
How
do
I
know
someone
ain't
got
Dan,
this
is
Marshal
Will
Doane
Marshal
Two
of
my
finest
men
I'm
sorry
about
all
that,
Marshal,
Don't
mention
it
So,
you
fellows
are
really
going
It
might
not
seem
like
it,
Mr..
Wade,
but
we
got
law
and
order
in
this
town,
Well,
that's
very
reassuring,
Marshal
How
much
money
is
Butterfield
paying
you?
That's
not
of
your
business
You're
coming
with
us?
I'll
be
walking
with
you
Every
step
of
the
way.
You
have
my
word
on
that,
Dan
That
makes
five
of
us.
Five
is
good
It
ain't
enough
It
ain't
nearly
enough
Pa!
That's
my
boy
They're
coming.
They
are
coming
this
way
I've
seen
them
About
a
mile
out,
same
way
we
come
how
many
are
they?
Which
is
it?
7
or
8?
Seven.
Folks,
sorry
to
bother
you,
but
I'm
going
That's
it,
folks.
Right
there.
Sure
there're
a
lot
of
them
Boss?
Boss,
are
you
are
in
there?
What
do
you
want
me
to
tell
them?
You
tell
them
you'll
write
Be
careful,
Wade.
Charlie,
Charlie,
why
don't
you
take
the
boys
Are
you
ok?
I
am
fine.
Just
sitting
up
here
with
That's
enough
Thank
You,
Charlie.
Listen
up!
Listen
up!!
That's
Ben
Wade
they
have
up
there!
Ben
Wade!
Now,
the
railroad
intends...
...
to
put
him
on
the
3:10
to
Yuma
and
hang
him
What's
he
doing?
We
will
give
you
$300
cash
To
any
man
who
shoots
$200
cash
guaranteed!
$200
guaranteed!
I'll
take
$200
You've
got
to
shoot
them
first
It's
gotta
be
30
or
40
with
guns
out
there
now
The
hell
with
this!
Now,
just
a
minute,
Marshal
Now,
look.
If
it's
a
fair
fight,
sure.
That's
a
man's
duty,
but...
There's
only
5
of
us
I'm
sorry,
Mr,
but
I'm
not
going
to
die
here
today
And
neither
are
my
men
Marshal,
...
You
forgot
this
Marshal?
Now,
you
see,
Dan.
Generally,
...
...
pretty
much
everyone
...
....
wants
to
live
I'll
double
your
money
Let's
go,
boys
Please,
do
you
want
to
see
This
thing
happened
in
Bigsby
That
means
Butterfield
too
Why
bring
your
troubles
to
Contention?
We've
got
families
I'm
a
family
man
too
He's
gona
walk
out
on
you
Then
you'd
best
get
out
He's

gonna
come
back
up
here
Now,
what
you've
got
to
figure
...
because
of
Butterfield's
railroad
loss
of
money?
They're
all
of
them?
Almost.
Your
move,
general
What
do
you
expect
him
to
say?
I
expect
him
to
say
something
that
makes
sense.
Something
that
might
save
the
two
of
you.
Take
a
look,
Dan
I'll
see
them
soon
enough
What
about
you,
kid?
Stay
away
from
the
window,
William.
Go
on
take
a
look.
They're
animals
They're
gonna
kill
you
and
your
father,
William
And
I'll
laugh
while
they
do
it
I
think
you
know
that
Call
them
them
off
Why
should
I?
Because
you're
not
all
bad
Yes,
I
am
Your
saved
us
from
those
Indians.
You
got
us
through
the
tunnels
If
I
had
a
gun
in
them
tunnels,
I
don't
believe
you.
Kid,
I
wouldn't
last
5
minutes
leading
an
outfit
Dan,
...
I
can't
do
it,
Dan,
and
if
I
can't
do
it,
They
say
discretion
is
the

part
of
valor
If
you
think
that
you
have
an
...
I
assure
you
you
do
not,
I'm
releasing
you
It's
just
you
left,
Dan.
Just
you
and
your
boy
Maybe
he
is
right,
Pa,
What
did
Doc
Potter
gave
his
life
for,
William?
And
McElroy?
Little
red
ants
on
a
hill
I'll
pay
you
the
$200,
Dan.
Right
now.
You
know,
this
whole
ride,
...
that's
what
the
government
...
$198.36
and
the
funny
thing
is
that...
...
when
you
think
about
it
...
...
-which
I
have
been
lately-
Don't
muddy
the
past
on
the
present,
Dan
No,
no,
no,
Wade.
I'm
seeing
the
world
the
way
it
is
If
you
take
him
to
the
train,
Pa,
I'm
going
with
you
No,
Mr.
Butterfield's
gonna
take
you
home
No,
I'm
not
going
any...
I'm
staying
here
with
you
You're
going
to
hold
up
in
the
room
I'll
get
him
to
Bigsby.
You're
going
to
promise
a
lot
more
than
that,
Butterfield
I
want
guarantees
that
Hollander
and
his
boys
And
that
my
water
is
going
to
flow.
I
can
deliver
that,
just
get
him
on
the
train.
You
heard
him?
William...
...I
want
you
to
give
this
back
to
your
mother
I
want
you
to
tell
her
it
helped
Pa,
I
can't
just
leave
you
I'm
going
to
be
a
day
behind
you,
William
To
run
things;
to
protect
our
family.
You've
become
a
fine
man
...
what
few
there
are
And
you
just
remember
You
know,
squeezing
that
watch
won't
stop
time
Don't
get
so
scared.
You
might

a
bad
mood.
Ever
read
the
Bible,
Dan?
I
read
it
one
time.
I
was
8
years
old.
My
daddy
had
just
got
So
she
gave
me
a
Bible,
sat
me
down
at
She
was
going
to
get
our
tickets
Well,
I
did
what
she
said
...
It
took
me
3
days
She
never
came
back.
It's
time
It's
a
half
mile
to
the
station
from
here,
Dan
I
guess
we're
walking
Lucky
Dan...
You're
not
gonna
get
a
chance
Perhaps
you
can
explain
to
me
Hey!
Not
the
black
hat!

you
dumb
shits!
Charlie.
Get
back!
Boss!
Let's
go!
White
Door!
I
can't
do
this
no
more,
Dan
I'm
putting
you
on
that
train,
Wade
I'm
going
back!
You
still
got
that
one
good
leg,
Charlie!
Charlie
Prince!
Yeah,
boss!
I'm
walking
out
I
have
never
been
no
hero,
Wade
Only

I've
seen,
it
was
a
retreat
...
...
my
foot
got
shot
off
by
one
of
my
own
men.
You
try
telling
that
story
to
your
boy
...
...
see
how
he
looks
at
you
then
Boss!
Ok,
Dan
Son.
They're
on
the
move
Boss,
Boss..
Can
you
make
this?
Spread
out!...
What
time
is
it?
Quarter
past
three
Where
is
the
3:10
to
Yuma?
Running
late,
I
suppose
How
late?
Beats
me
It
gets
here
when
it
gets
here
God
damned
trains,
You
know...
Excuse
me?
You
said
I
was
stubborn
for
It's
my
son,
Mark
The
young
one
He
got
tuberculosis
when
he
was
2
Doctor
said
he'd
die
Why
are
you
telling
me
this?
I
don't
know
I
guess
that
I
just
...
I
ain't
stubborn.
That's
all
Well,
as
long
as
we're
making
confesions
I've
been
to
Yuma
Prison
before
Twice
First
car,
sliding
door
They'll
be
coming
I've
got
a
prisoner
to
go
to
Yuma
Well,
you
did
it,
Dan
No!
Pa!
For
a
one
legged
rancher,
...
...
he's
one
tough
son
of
a
bitch
You
done
it,
Pa
You
done
it.
