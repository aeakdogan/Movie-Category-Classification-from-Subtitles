Long
ago,
in
ancient
China,
the
Peacocks
ruled
over
Gongmen
City.
They
brought
great
joy
for
they
had
invented
fireworks.
But
their
son,
Lord
Shen,
saw
darker
power
in
the
fireworks.
What
had
brought
colour
and
joy
could
also
bring
darkness
Shen's
troubled
parents
She
foretold
that
if
Shen
he
would
be
defeated
The
young
lord
But
what
he
did
next
only
sealed
it.
Shen
returned
to
his
parents
But
in
their
faces,
he
saw
only
horror.
He
was
banished
from
the
city
forever.
But
Shen
swore
revenge.
Someday
he
would
return
and
all
of
China
would
bow
at
his
feet.
It's
almost
done,
Lord
Shen,
Search
the
farthest
villages!
China
will
be
mine.
And
then
the
Dragon
Warrior
And
they
became
the
most
Enough
talk.
Let's
fight!
-
Thirty-three...
You
can
hear
the
Dragon
Warrior
Thirty-three.
Stop
him!
-
Thirty-four.
-
Thirty-five.
Stay
focused.
-
Thirty-seven!
How
is
he
doing
that
with
his
face?
Thirty-eight
bean
buns!
Yes!
New
record!
You
monster!
-
Keep
going!
Hit
40!
You
guys
wait
and
we'll
go
to
40.
Do
it.
No
problem!
Yeah!
Give
me
a
minute.
Yeah!
-
He
did
it!
Your
training
has
paid
off.
Master
Shifu!
You'll
save
those
for
me,
right?
Flippety-do.
Inner
peace.
Master
Shifu.
Master
Shifu,
what
do
we
got?
Pirates?
Vandals
of
Volcano
Mountain?
Whatever
it
is,
I
will
take
them
down.
I
need
to
get
something
done,
What
are
you
doing?
One
of
Master
Oogway's
final
teachings.
Awesome!
How
did
you
do
that?
-
Inner
peace.
-
Inner
piece
of
what?
Every
master
must
find
his
path
Some
choose
to
meditate
for
50
years
...without
the
slightest
taste
Or?
Some
find
it
through
Po,
the
day
you
were
chosen
was
the
worst
day
of
my
life.
By
far.
It
was
the
worst,
most
painful,
-
OK.
But
once
I
realised
the
problem
I
found
inner
peace
and
was
able
So
that's
it?
I
just
need
inner
peace?
My
innards
are
so
all
I
need
to
do
Inner
peace,
you're
going
down.
Now
show
me
what
you
were
I
saw
you
do
sort
of
a
fancy
foot...
Po!
Bandits!
Danger.
Tell
those
musicians
to
start
playing
Don't
worry,
Shifu,
I'll
master
No
snack
stops
this
time.
Snack
stops.
Wait,
are
you
serious?
Get
all
the
metal
you
can
find!
Grab
the
metal!
Help,
help,
help,
help.
Help!
That's
everything!
Oh,
no.
Wings
of
Justice!
The
Dragon
Warrior!
A
panda?
That's
impossible.
My
fist
hungers
for
justice.
That
was
my...
fist.
-
Get
'em!
Take
that!
Po!
Incoming!
Thanks,
Mantis!
Tigress,
Double
Death
Strike!
Feet
of
Fury!
Tigress!
Monkey!
Viper!
Mantis!
Bunny!
What?
Oh,
sorry.
Help!
-
Crane,
go!
Is
everyone
OK?
That
was
awesome!
I
got
this.
Po!
Chew
on
that,
tubby!
Help.
-
Sweetie,
are
you
OK?
I
think
I
saw...
I
think...
I
gotta
go.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
for
coming
-
More
tea?
Lemon
sauce?
If
you
need
anything,
just
ask.
-
Thank
you.
The
Dragon
Warrior's
mop.
No
touching!
-
He
once
waited
on
me.
Yeah,
I
have
the
stain
to
prove
it.
He
doesn't
work
here
any
more.
He's
busy
out
there
-
The
Dragon
Warrior!
Po!
-
Here.
OK.
Nice
kid.
-
You
should've
told
me
you
were
coming.
I
would
have
saved
you
some
stinky
tofu.
-
Dad,
can
I
talk
to
you?
In
honour
of
my
son,
With
purchases.
Oh,
it's
so
good
to
see
you,
Po.
Have
you
lost
weight?
I
can
Ah,
well,
maybe
a
little.
Poor
you,
you
must
feel
weak.
No,
that's
OK,
Dad.
Not
hungry?
Yeah.
No,
I'm
fine.
I
just...
Earlier
today,
Nothing
too
dangerous.
-
Yeah?
I
had
this
crazy
vision.
I
think
I
saw
my
mom
and
me,
Mom?
A
baby?
-
Dad?
How
do
I
say
this?
Where
did
I
come
from?
Well,
you
see,
son,
-
Don't
ask
me
where
the
egg
comes
from.
I
know
it's
not.
I
think
it's
time
I
told
you
something
OK.
You
might
have
been
kind
of
a...
...adopted.
-
I
knew
it.
-
Well,
who
told
you?
But
if
you
knew,
Why
didn't
you
say
anything?
How
did
I
get
here,
Dad?
Actually...
you
came
from
this.
It
was
just
another
day
Time
to
make
the
noodles.
I
went
out
to
the
back,
where
my
There
were
cabbages,
turnips,
radishes.
Only
there
were
no
radishes.
Just
a
very
hungry
baby
panda.
There
was
no
note.
Of
course,
you
could
have
eaten
it.
I
waited
for
someone
to
come
I
brought
you
inside.
Fed
you.
Gave
you
a
bath.
And
fed
you
again.
And
again.
And
tried
to
put
some
pants
on
you.
And
then
I
made
a
decision
To
make
my
soup
without
radishes.
And
to
raise
you
as
my
own
son.
Xiao
Po,
my
little
panda.
And
from
that
moment
on,
have
been
that
much
sweeter.
And,
little
Po,
Look
at
me.
No,
don't
look
at
me.
That's
it?
That
can't
be
it.
Well,
there
was
the
time
It
was
imported,
too.
One
dumpling,
please,
Oh,
Po,
your
story
may
not
but
look
how
it
turned
out.
You
got
me,
you
got
kung
fu,
I
know.
I
just
have
so
many
questions.
Like
how
did
I
ever
fit
Why
didn't
I
like
pants?
And
who
am
I?
Good.
Watch
your
form.
Good.
Better.
Elbow.
Straighten
it
out!
Shen?
Good
afternoon,
gentlemen.
Now
we've
got
the
pleasantries
-
Your
house?
Didn't
you
see
the
peacock
There
you
are,
Soothsayer.
It
seems
your
fortune-telling
skills
-
We
shall
see,
Shen.
-
Where
were
we?
What
is
rightfully
mine.
Gongmen
City!
Gongmen
is
under
the
stewardship
and
we
will
protect
it.
Even
from
you.
I'm
so
glad
you
feel
that
way.
Otherwise,
I'd
have
dragged
What's
in
the
box,
Shen?
You
want
to
see?
It's
a
gift.
It's
your
parting
gift,
Part
of
you
here,
part
of
you
there
and
part
of
you
way
over
there,
You
insolent
fool!
-
Show-off.
You
are
no
match
for
our
kung
fu.
I
agree.
But
this
is.
Are
you
familiar
-
Master
Thundering
Rhino?
-
Son
of
legendary
Flying
Rhino?
And
slayer
of
the
Ten
Thousand
-
He's
dead.
That's
impossible.
Rhino's
Horn
Defence
It
was
no
technique.
one
that
breathes
fire
and
spits
metal.
Unless
he
is
stopped,
-
But
I
just
got
kung
fu!
Go!
Destroy
this
weapon
OK,
here
we
go!
Here
we
go!
Wait
a
second.
I
mean,
how
can
kung
fu
stop
Remember,
Dragon
Warrior,
anything
is
possible
Inner
peace.
Inner
peace.
Inner
peace.
Peace
on.
-
Oh,
Po?
Oh,
Po,
I
got
you
a
travel
pack.
I
packed
you
food
for
weeks.
And
I
even
packed
I
don't
know
what
those
are.
Dad,
you
got
scratches
on
my
Tigress.
I
also
packed
your
paintings
just
in
case
you
get
lonely.
That's
me
and
you
making
noodles.
And
that's
me
giving
you
That
cute?
On
second
thought,
-
Hey,
they're
waiting
for
me.
You
have
a
job
to
do...
far
from
home,
in
a
strange
city,
filled
with
facing
horrible
danger
-
Don't
go,
Po!
I'm
the
Dragon
Warrior.
And
if
I
don't...
what
am
I?
You're
my
son.
Right?
-
Po,
it's
time.
Don't
worry,
Mr.
Ping.
He'll
be
back
before
Noodles.
Come
on,
guys,
let's
go!
Yeah!
Yeah...
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah...
Mama?
Mom?
Dad?
Is
that
you?
Mom!
Dad!
Oh,
hi.
Hey,
son.
You're
back.
Honey,
what
are
you
doing
here?
But
I
thought...
We

you,
dear,

Radish?

No.
No,

Wait!
No.
Radish,

The
mast
is
not
a
worthy
opponent.
-
I
am
ready.
So
serious.
I
think
I
prefer
the
mast.
Apologies.
I
used
to
punch
the
Now
I
feel
nothing.
That's
severely
cool.
Again!
So,
this

trees,
-
Twenty
years.
Is
there
any,
you
know,
faster
way?
You
know,
until
you,
you
know,
No.
Besides...
...I
don't
think
Po,
why
are
you
really
out
here?
I
just
found
out
that
my
dad
Your
dad?
The
goose.
That
must
have
been
quite
a
shock.
Yeah.
-
And
this
bothers
you?
We're
warriors,
right?
Souls
of
platinum.
Like
you.
So
hard-core,
you
don't
feel
anything.
-
I
was...
Nothing.
Nothing.
Po's
having
daddy
issues.
I'm
so
lucky.
Maybe
it's
because
Mom
-
I
don't
know.
Po
is
the
one
freaking
out.
-
I'm
not
freaking
out.
-
I'm
freaking
in.
-
What?
Gongmen
City.
My
father's
throne.
He
used
to
let
me
play
here
beside
him,
promising
someday,
A
little
to
the
left.
Oh,
but
it's
so
heavy,
Master!
Thirty
years
I've
waited
Everything
must
be
exactly
And
I
envisioned
it
Perfect!
With
the
weapon
by
my
si...
With
the
weapon
by
my
side,
We
move
out
in
three
days,
when
the
moon
is
full
Now,
you
old
goat,
Fortune?
Future.
I
was
going
to
say
future.
Look
into
your
bowl
If
you
continue
on
your
current
path...
...you
will
find
yourself
I
see...
I
see
pain...
and
anger.
How
dare
you!
Followed
by
denial.
This
is
not
fortune-telling.
-
what's
happening
right...
The
most
important
time
is
now.
But
if
you
really
want
Oh,
what
do
you
see?
A
peacock...
...is
defeated
by
a
warrior
Nothing
has
changed.
That's
impossible,
and
you
know
it.
It
is
not
impossible,
and
he
knows
it.
Who?
-
Lord
Shen!
I
saw
a
panda!
A
kung
fu
warrior.
Big
and
furry.
Soft
and
squishy.
There
are
no
more
pandas.
Even
with
his
poor
eyesight,
Why
is
it
that
you
cannot?
Find
this
panda
and
bring
him
to
me!
Yes,
sir!
One
panda
lives.
You're
right.
Then
I
will
kill
him
and
make
you
wrong.
Will
you
stop
that!
That
must
be
Shen's
palace
Great.
We'll
march
into
the
tower
"We
are
the
Dragon
Warrior
and
we
are
here
What
are
you
doing?
Hey,
isn't
that
the
guy
I
do
not
like
that
guy.
We
need
to
get
to
that
tower
Got
it.
Stealth
mode.
-
Get
out
of
the
way!
Now,
where'd
those
noodles
go?
Hello.
I
couldn't
help
but...
Yeah,
OK.
Anyway,
where
was
I?
-
Where's
Po?
OK.
Guys!
Guys?
-
Hey,
Po.
So
that
was
stealth
mode,
huh?
To
be
honest,
...gold
in
there,
come
on!
This
rice
is
raw!
You
stole
all
my
metal
pots
Either
you
cook
my
rice,
or
I
cook
you!
-
My
apologies,
but...
How
am
I
supposed
to
help
her
cook
rice
-
Wait,
I
have
a
better
idea.
...one.
-
Hey.
We're
here
to
liberate
the
city
-
You
will
need
help.
but
it's
too
dangerous.
I
can't
let
you.
Oh,
no,
not
me.
Right.
I'm
talking
about
Masters
Ox
and
Croc.
They're
in
Gongmen
Jail
What?
They're
still
alive?
They
must
be
in
that
jail
hatching
a
plot
to
use
their
OK,
let's
go!
-
Thanks,
sheep.
-
Hold
it
right
there!
-
Get
them!
Take
that!
-
Keep
going!
Hey,
stop!
-
Look
out!
Watch
it!
Surround
him.
Now!
Gotcha!
What?
Where'd
he
go?
-
Spread
out!
Search
everywhere!
-
Is
"there"
a
part
of
"everywhere"?
Then
search
there!
They
must
be
close.
I
can
feel
Sorry,
Po.
It's
just
me.
Look.
Gongmen
Jail.
Aw,
it's
cute.
Cute,
huh?
Nice
work,
Po.
At
the
first
sign
of
trouble,
-
You
mean
like
Crane
does?
Excuse
me,
Master
Ox!
Master!
The
ferocious

And
Master
Storming

No,
Oh,
good!
You
found
it.
We're
coming
for
you,
Shen!
Guys,
are
we
going
or
not?
I
mean,
you
do
want
to
Of
course
we
do.
But
if
we
stand
up
to
Shen,
Listen
to
yourself.
by
not
protecting
Gongmen
City?
-
If
we
all
fight
together...
Oh,
would
it?
-
We
get
inside
and
then...
...by
the
unstoppable
weapon.
Nothing's
unstoppable
except
for
me
from
telling
me
something's
unstoppable!
Master
Ox,
I'd
like
to
see
you
get
me
out!
You
guys
see
that?
Come
on!
Whatever
The
only
hero
in
this
town
Like
I
said,
you
are
not
Yes!
All
right,
let's
go!
I
get
the
top
bunk.
It's
time
to
surrender,
panda.
I...
You...
Kung
fu
is
dead?
Fine!
You
stay
in
your
prison
of
fear
And
all
you
get
are
three
With
despair
for
dessert.
We'll
take
on
Shen
and
prove
for
justice
and
honour
Yeah!
Monkey?!
You!
You're
mine!
I'll
tell
you
what's
gonna
be
yours!
My
fist
in
your
plush,
cuddly,
Get
him!
-
Get
me
out
of
here!
Stop
him!
Faster!
Yeah!
Go,
go!
-
Lose
him!
-
Viper!
-
What?
Uncool!
Very
uncool!
Try
this!
Guys,
guys,
guys!
Maybe
something
smaller!
No,
no!
Oh,
no,
no.
Cute
bunnies,
off
the
face.
Fire!
We've
lost
them.
Again!
Again!
Crane,
catch!
Gotcha!
Guys,
guys,
guys,
guys,
Mantis,
now!
Is
that
all
you
got?
It
feels
like
Well,
this
cloud
is
about
Your
turn!
Why...
are...
there...
Come
here!
Alaka-squasho!
Yes!
Taste
the
defeat!
Let
me
tell
you
something.
Next
time
you
mess
with
a
panda,
Guess
nobody
told
you,
if
you
mess
with
the
wolf,
I've
hit
you
twice.
We
surrender!
You
can
chain
my
body,
but
you
will
-
Hey,
don't
forget
the
little
guy.
-
Po,
what
are
you
doing?
No
way.
Eight-point
acupressure
cuffs?
Just
like
the
ones
that
held
Tai
Lung.
These
are
the
best
cuffs!
Greetings,
panda.
At
last
we
meet!
No,
no,
no...
We
meet
at
last!
Yes,
that's
it.
Greetings,
panda.
We
meet
at...
-
You
are
afraid
for
a
reason.
He
is
coming
to
me
in
chains.
-
If
anyone
should
be
afraid,
it's...
Don't
even
think
about
it.
I
hope
this
turns
out
better
than
by
eating
it
raw
This
plan's
nothing
like
that
plan.
-
How?
Keep
moving.
Ah,
my
old
enemy...
...stairs.
Thanks
for
carrying
me
I
threw
up
a
little
bit
Someone
might
want
to
clean
that
up.
Is
there
some
sort
of
evil
janitor
Greetings,
panda.
-
We
meet
at...
Hey.
You've
grown
up
bigger
than
I
thought.
Hey...
enough
with
the
poking
around.
Strong.
Healthy.
Look,
I
don't
know
who
you
are,
-
That's
a
lady.
The
beard
threw
me.
-
False
advertising.
Bring
the
prisoners
to
me.
Sorry,
ma'am.
Get
ready,
guys.
Keep
your
eyes
peeled
for
the...
Sparrow
kick!
We
did
it!
I
just
kung
fu-ed
it!
Do
you
actually
believe
this
is
I
do
not.
I
know
he
is.
Oh,
look
at
him.
-
and
he
comes
to
me
on
his
knees.
I
did
not
have
a
lifetime.
We
only
heard
about
Master
Rhino
-
and
we
came
to
avenge
him!
Well,
yeah.
-
I'm
gonna
want
those
back.
You
probably
did
some
other
evil
stuff
-
What
else
did
you
do?
Know
what?
What's
so
funny?
The
very
thing
OK,
enough
of
these
riddles!
First,
we
come
in
and
the
weapon
And
then
the
lady
over
here,
The
only
reason
you
are
still
alive
is
that
I
find
your
stupidity
Well,
thank
you.
But
I
find
your
Who
do
you
think
you
are,
panda?
Who
do
you
think
I
am,
peacock?
Why
are
we
laughing?
Take
aim.
Fire.
Well,
light
the...
thing!
I
did!
Fear
the
bug!
Get
the
weapon!
Tigress!
You...
You
were
there.
Yes.
Yes,
I
was.
-
You
just
let
Shen
get
away!
Fire!
Oh.
No,
he's
got
way
more.
-
My
wing!
Coming!
-
Watch
out!
-
Help
me
up!
Use
the
ropes.
Run,
run,
little
panda!
-
Po,
come
on.
We
need
you
to
focus!
Bring
it
down!
-
We're
trapped!
Goodbye!
Fire!
Get
back!
The
only
way
out
is
up.
What?
Follow
me!
Come
on!
Where
are
they
going?
-
To
the
top!
Here
we
go!
-
You
idiot!
Call
in
the
wolves!
All
of
them!
The
Year
of
the
Peacock
begins
now!
Right
now?
so
you'd
only
get
like
And
this
is
the
Year,
of
course,
Happy
New
Year,
sir.
Get
the
wolves
ready.
Now!
Now,
now,
now,
now,
now!
Move!
Move,
move,
move,
move!
This
way.
Let's
go.
Oh,
you!
What
did
you
do?
What
happened
to
stopping
Shen?
Yeah.
Guys,
come
on.
I
meant
for
him
to
get
away.
'Cause...
it
was
a
trick.
It
was
a
plot.
I
was
thinking...
That
makes
no
sense.
What
do
you
mean?
Sure
it
does.
Po,
the
truth.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I...
Yeah...
The
truth.
Fine.
They
will
keep
you
-
Real
far.
You're
staying
here.
Wait!
I
have
to
go
ba...
You're
staying
here!
I'm
going.
And
you
can't
stop
me.
OK.
I
wasn't
ready
that
time.
Guys?
Don't.
Ready.
Look!
Stay
down.
-
I
have
to
get
to
him.
He
was
there!
OK?
The
peacock
was
there
He
knows
what
happened.
Who
I
am.
Look,
I'm
going.
I
have
to
know.
The
hard
core
can't
understand.
Tigress,
no!
The
hard
core
do
understand.
But
I
can't
watch
my
friend
be
killed.
-
We're
going.
-
Stop
being
a
wimp.
-
No.
You're
better
off
here.
You
were
wrong,
Soothsayer.
Your
magic
panda
is
clearly
a
fool.
Are
you
certain
it
is
the
panda
You
just
destroyed
A
trivial
sacrifice...
Then
will
you
finally
be
satisfied?
Will
the
subjugation
of
the
whole
world
It's
a
start.
I
might
also
convert
The
cup
you
choose
to
fill
It
is
time
to
stop
this
madness.
Why
on
earth
would
I
do
that?
So
your
parents
can
rest
in
peace.
My
parents
hated
me.
Do
you
understand?
They
wronged
me...
They
loved
you.
They
loved
you
so
much
that
The
dead
exist
in
the
past...
Set
the
soothsayer
free.
Goodbye,
Shen.
Happiness
must
be
taken.
And
I
will
take
mine.
-
Hurry
it
up!
If
all
of
those
weapons
-
We
bring
down
the
building.
-
This
will
work!
I
can't
feel
my
face.
Did
you
hear
him
call
it
-
Hey.
OK.
So,
keep
it
cool.
You!
Where
are
you
going?
On
your
feet!
And
wipe
those
Move,
you
dogs!
Greetings,
panda.
-
Tell
me
what
happened
that
night.
-
That
night.
Yes!
We're
talking
Yes,
I
was
there.
Yes.
I
watched
It's
a
terrible
thing.
Here's
your
New
Year's
gift.
Hope
you
like
it,
Po?
What's
he
doing
here?
Return
it!
Return
it!
Are
you
willing
to
die
You
bet
I
am.
We
got
them.
Go!
You
looking
for
me?
I
said
that
too
soon,
didn't
I?
Po!
Po,
get
away
from
him.
I'll
get
up.
Here
we
go.
-
No
more
running,
Shen.
Now...
answers.
Oh,
you
want
to
know
so
badly.
You
think
knowing
will
heal
you,
huh?
Fill
some
crater
in
your
soul?
Well,
here's
your
answer.
Your
parents
didn't
love
you.
But
here...
...let
me
heal
you!
No!
Yeah,
like
you
could
make
me
drink
that.
If
I
wanted
you
dead,
-
Well,
why
save
me?
What
are
you
talking
about?
What
is
this
place?
I'm
surprised
you
remember
so
little.
But
you
were
so
little
when
it
happened.
Perhaps
you
do
remember.
What?
It's
just
a
stupid
nightmare.
Nightmare?
Or
memory?
This
was
a
thriving
village.
Young
Shen
was
in
line
But
he
wanted
more.
I
foretold
that
someone
would
stand
But
I
never
could
have
foretold
Get
them
all!
Take
our
son
and
run
away!
Go!
Stop
fighting.
Let
it
flow.
Your
story
may
not
have
but
that
doesn't
It
is
the
rest
of
your
story.
Who
you
choose
to
be.
So,
who
are
you,
panda?
I
am
Po.
And
I'm
gonna
need
a
hat.
Such
sad,
sad
faces.
But
now
is
a
time
only
for
joy.
You
are
going
to
be
part
Once
we
reach
the
harbour,
you
and
your
precious
kung
fu
will
die.
Then
China
will
know
to
bow
before
me.
Set
sail!
What
is
that?
Honestly,
guys,
I
always
thought
I'd
meet
...then
she'd
eat
my
head.
-
So
sad.
Po
would
want
us
to
remain
strong.
-
Lord
Shen,
what
about
the
bridge?
Fire!
You
coward!
Po?
How
many
times
do
I
have
to
kill
Shen!
A
panda
stands
between
you
What?
Prepare
yourself
for
a
Your
reign
of
terror
comes
to
an
end.
-
What?
Disc
of
Destruction!
OK.
Take
aim!
Ready?
You
can't
follow
me.
Just
get
him!
-
Yeah.
Here
we
go.
-
No,
no,
no,
don't
shoot!
No,
don't
shoot!
-
Don't
shoot!
-
You
don't
shoot!
Yeah!
-
Don't
shoot!
Cross
fire!
-
Catch
of
Freedom!
Impressive,
Dragon
Warrior.
-
Step
one,
free
the
Five.
Honestly,
I
didn't
think
Po!
Stop
Shen
before
he
gets
to
the
harbour.
Nice!
Viper,
Puppet
of
Death!
Tigress!
-
Master
Ox!
-
And
Croc!
-
Why
did
you...?
Master
Shifu!
Quickly.
Use
their
boats
Crane!
Wings
of
Justice!
Yeah!
What?
I
love
you
guys.
Why
aren't
we
firing?
They're
taking
out
our
gunners,
sir.
Fire!
Fire
at
them!
-
But,
sir,
we'll
kill
our
own.
Fire!
No.
Po!
Tigress?
As
you
wish.
Let's
finish
this.
Fire!
Inner
peace.
Again!
Yeah!
Kill
him!
Somebody
kill
him!
What?
No.
No!
Keep
firing!
Keep
firing!
Skadoosh.
How
did
you...?
How
did
you
do
it?
You
know,
you
just
keep
your
elbows
up
Not
that.
How
did
you
find
peace?
I
took
away
your
parents.
Everything.
I
scarred
you
for
life.
See,
that's
the
thing,
Shen.
No,
they
don't.
Wounds
heal.
Oh,
yeah.
What
do
scars
do?
-
I
don't
care
what
scars
do.
You
gotta
let
go
of
that
stuff
from
The
only
thing
that
matters
You're
right.
Then
I
choose...
this!
That
was
pretty
hard-core.
-
Po!
-
Come
here!
Yeah!
It
seems
you
have
found
inner
peace.
And
at
such
a
young
age.
Well,
I
had
a
pretty
good
teacher.
What
do
you
mean
he's
not
here?
All
he
wanted
was
to
meet
How
about
some
tofu
birthday
cake
You
know,
I
think
we'll
When
do
you
think
he'll
be
back?
I
don't
know.
OK,
I
don't
know.
I
mean,
I
worry,
OK?
At
least,
I
was
his
dad.
Why
did
he
have
to
go
and
save
China?
But
why?
He's
just
one
little
panda.
So,
how
did
it
go?
Yep.
Well,
I
knew
you
would.
That's
why
I
had
new
signs
made.
"My
son
saved
China.
Buy
one
dumpling,
get
one
free."
Hey,
that's
a
pretty
good
deal.
-
Would
you
like
to
try
one?
There's
something
I
should
tell
you.
While
I
was
gone,
I
found
out
how
I
ended
up
You
did?
-
I
know
who
I
am.
I'm
your
son.
I
love
you,
Dad.
I
love
you,
too,
son.
Delicious,
fat
radishes!
You're
probably
hungry.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I'll
cook.
-
No,
no,
I'll
cook.
Well,
it's
the
least
I
can
do.
No,
it's
the
least
I
can
do.
-
Po.
-
Po!
Let's
both
cook.
Together.
Together.
No,
I'll
cook.
My
son
is
alive.
