Once
upon
a
time
the
king
and
queen
were
blessed
And
throughout
the
land,
until
the
sun
went
down
and
they
saw
that
their
daughter
was
that
took
hold
each
and
every
night.
Desperate,
they
sought
the
help
who
had
them
lock
the
young
princess
there
to
await
the
kiss...

It
was
he
who
would
chance
through
blistering
cold
traveling
for
many
days
and
nights,
risking
life
and
limb
to
reach
the
Dragon's
keep.

For
he
was
the
bravest,
and
most
handsome...
in
all
the
land.
And
it
was
destiny
that
his
kiss
would
break
the
dreaded
curse.
He
alone
would
climb
to
the
highest
room
to
enter
the
princess's
chambers,
pull
back
the
gossamer
curtains
What?
-
Princess...
Fiona?

Oh,
thank
heavens.
-
She's
on
her
honeymoon.
-
She's
on
her
honeymoon.

#
So
she
said
#
What's
the
problem?
#
Well,
maybe
I'm
in
love
#
Think
about
it
#
Can't
stop
thinking
'bout
it
#
How
much
longer
#
Just
to
cure
it,
#
If
it's
love,
love
#
Makes
me
wanna
turn
around
#
But
I
don't
know
nothing
#
Oh,
come
on,
come
on
-

#
Come
on,
come
on
#
The
world
will
follow
after
#
Come
on,
come
on
#
Everybody's
after
love
#
So
I
said
#
Running
down
into
this
spring
#
Melting
under
blue
skies
#
Shimmering
love
#
Well,
baby,
I
surrender
#
To
the
strawberry
ice
cream
#
Never
ever
end
of
all
this
love
#
Well,
I
didn't
mean
to
do
it
#
But
there's
no
escaping
your
love
#
These
lines
of
lightning
#
Never
alone,
no,
no
#
Come
on,
come
on
#
Jump
a
little
higher
#
Come
on,
come
on
#
If
you
feel
a
little
lighter
#
Come
on,
come
on
#
We
were
once
upon
a
time
