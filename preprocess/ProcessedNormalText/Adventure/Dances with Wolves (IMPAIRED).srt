Postscript--
The
man
I
encountered
was
a
magnificent-looking

I
do
not
care
for
this
talk
Whatever
he
is,
he
is
not
Sioux
When
I
hear
that
more
whites
We
took
a
hundred
horses
There
was
no
honor
in
it.
They
don't
ride
well.
They're
dirty.
Those
soldiers
could
not
even
And
these
people
I
think
they
will
I
think
this
fool
Wind
In
His
Hair's
words
are
It's
true
the
whites
are
But
make
no
mistake.
Even
our
enemies
agree
on
this.
So
when
I
see
one
man
alone
I
do
not
think
he
is
lost.
I
see
someone
who
might
speak...
for
all
the
white
people
I
think
this
is
a
person
with
Kicking
Bird
is
always
But
this
man
cannot
cover
He
is
nothing
to
us.
I
will
take
some
men.
We
will
shoot
some
arrows
If
he
truly
has
medicine,
If
he
has
no
medicine,
No
man
can
tell
another
But
killing
a
white
man
If
you
kill
one,
It's
easy
to
become
confused
It's
hard
to
know
what
to
do.
We
should
talk
about
this
That
is
all
I
have
to
say.

Yes,
sir,
I
have.
No.
I'll
ask,
sir.

[Shouting
We'll
be
heroes!
They'll
write
songs
about
us.
What
happened?
I
don't
know.
You
shouldn't
have
fallen
off.
It
was
your
idea.
My
idea
was
only
to
take
Otter

himself.
What
are
you
looking
at?
I
will
be
when
my
father
finds
out.
Oh,
God.

Eeeaaaah!

am

you
see
Do
you
see?
Whoo!
Whoo!
Aah!
I
realize
now
All
this
time,
Waiting
for
what?
For
someone
to
find
me?
To
see
a
buffalo?
Since
I
have
arrived
I
have
been
I
am
sick
of
it.
Tomorrow,
I
will
ride
out
I
do
not
know
the
wisdom
but
I've
become
a
target,
and
a
target
I
am
through
waiting.
What
are
you


Ahem.
Son
of
a
bitch.
No.
Wait.
Wait!
Wait.
Wait.

Wait.
You
need
help.
Aah!

me--
You
need

You
need

Let
me
help
you.
Let
me
help
you.
You're

You're
hurt.

She's
hurt.
She's
hurt.
You
are
not
welcome
here.
No.
She's

Go
away
from
us!
You
are
not
welcome!

Stop.
The
soldier
did
not
come
He
is
going
away
I
am
in
agreement

will
go
down
and
talk
And
find
out
why
If
this
council
decides
to
talk
then
it
will
be
so.
But
in
my
mind
that
a
chief
as
great
goes
to
ask
the
business
of
who
has
only
a
smart
horse
I
will
not
go.
You
will
go.
And
you
will
go.
That
is
all
I
have
to
say.
