Thank
you,
thank
you.

...view
the
Catholic
Church.
They
think
of
us
as
a
pass,
People
find
the
Bible
obtuse...
...even
hokey.
Now,
in
an
effort
...the
Church
has
appointed
this
year
...both
of
faith
and
of
style.
For
example,
the
crucifix.
While
it
has
been
a
time-honored
...Holy
Mother
Church
...this
highly
recognizable...
...yet
wholly
depressing
image...
...of
our
Lord,
crucified.
Christ
didn't
come
to
Earth
He
came
to
help
us
out.
He
was
a
booster,
and
it's
...that
we've
come
up
with
a
new,
So
it
is
with
great
pleasure
...of
many
revamps
...will
unveil
over
the
next

..."The
Buddy
Christ."
That's
not
the
sanctioned
term
Just
something
we've
been
But
look
at
it.
Doesn't
it
pop?
Buddy
Christ.
Well,
there
you
have
it.
Let
me
get
this
straight.

in
God
No,

an
indictment

Walrus,

obviously

his
tusks,
the
Hindu
That
takes

Now,
the
Carpenter,
...who
was
raised
a
carpenter's
son,
Now,
in
the
poem,
They
dupe
all
these
oysters
...then
proceed
to
shuck
and
devour
I
don't
know
what
that
says
to
you,
...that
following
these
faiths
...destroys
one's
inner
being.
Organized
religion
destroys
...by
inhibiting
our
actions,
...out
of
fear
of
some
...who
shakes
a
finger
at
us
...and
says,
"Do
it...
Oh,
Jesus!

you
put
it,

that
anger,
all
that

perfect
moment

those
two?
That
guy
doesn't
know
that
the
girl

She
did?
-
Nice.
...because
they're
just
both
so
relieved
I
like
that.
I
wish
they
could
all

this
why
I
had
to
come
down
here

me,
you

me

You
might

that.
Back
in
the
old
days,
And
his
wrath
was
bore...
...by
the
Angel
of
Death,
When
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
...that
was
Loki.
When
the
waters
wiped
out
everything
...that
was
Loki.
But
one
day
he
refused
to
-
Why?
...a
Grigori
Grigori?
One
of
the
choirs
of
angels.
Guess
what
they
do.
So

day,

Tenth

a
person
you're

Metatron,
Mention
something
in

I
continue
uninterrupted?
Once
he's
done
with

firstborn...

takes
his
friend
Bartleby
out
And
over
many
rounds...
...they
get
into
...whether

And
in
the
end...
...Bartleby
convinces
Loki
...and
take
one
which
doesn't
So...
...very
inebriated...
...Loki
tells
God
he
quits...
...throws
down
his
fiery
sword...
...and
gives
him
the
finger.
Which
ruins
it
for
the
rest
of
us
...God
decreed
that
angels
Hence
all
the
spitting.
So
for
their
insolence...
...God
decreed
that
neither
Loki
...would
ever
be
allowed
-
Were
they
sent
to
hell?
Wisconsin...
...for
the
entire
span
And
when
the

ends,
they'll
have

this
has
what
to
do
with

Someone
has
clued
them
in

would

them

what?
They
beat
the
system.
It's
not

simple.
If

listen
closely
because

unmake

If

is
so
major,
Why
doesn't
God
He
could.
But
he'd
rather
see
you
Why
me?
Because
of
who
you
are.
And
who
am
I?

girl
in
the
P.J.'s!
Don't
ask
so
many
questions.
I'm
gonna
have
to
pass.

beg
your
pardon?

quiet
little
infection

husband
decided...
...he
couldn't
be

wife

was
God?

hell
with
him.
Don't
allow
eons
of

I
can't
make

should
decide

accept
your
responsibility...

won't
be
alone.
You'll
have

a
manner
of
speaking.

one

speaks...
And
he
will,

great
length,

will
make
mention

he's
the
quiet

...and
we
get
the
Jesus
freak?
-
Let's
get
out
of
here.
-
I'll
scream
rape.
Pay?
A
hundred
bucks
You
were
going
to
Jersey
anyway.
I
feel
like
Han
Solo,
you're
Chewie,
...and
we're
in
that
fucked-up
bar!
What
about
sex?
No
sex.
Let's
say
we're
caught
in
a
situation
A
bomb
or
something's
gonna
go
off.
In
that
highly
unlikely
situation?
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah?
She's
a
slut.
All
right.
But
I
get
to
drive.
What
gear
are
you
in?
Gear?
Well,
what
do
I
know
Like
I
ever
drove
before.
Indiana,
Ohio,
Pennsylvania...
...New
Jersey.
Maybe
you're
wrong
How
can
you
be
sure
what
incurs
Times
change.
I
remember
eating
meat
on
a
Friday
The
major
sins
never
change.
And
besides,
I
can
spot
...from,
like,
a
mile
away.
Bet
on
it.
This
from
the
guy
who
still
owes
me
...about
which
was
gonna
be
the
You
know,
fuck
you,
man,
Are
you
insinuating
that
I
don't
have
Insinuating,
no.
Flat-out
telling
you.
Right
there.
Right
there.
So?
They're
kissing.
Adultery.
-
Adultery?
You
are
just
a
simple
creature.
-
Am
I
right
or
what?
I'm
not
gonna
tell.
I
wanna
see
-
What's
your
proof?
And
it
never
occurred
to
you
No
married
man
kisses
Okay.
Well,
it's
a
good
thing
...the
deciding
member
on
a
jury
"No
married
man
kisses
his
wife
Excuse
me.
Are
you
married?
Why?
I'm
just
curious.
What
do
you
think?
-
What?
-
What?
Not
that
it's
any
of
Why?
Whose
house?
Run's
house
I
said,
whose
house?
Run's
house
Whose
house
Run's
house
Martin
She's
fucking
pissed,
dude.
Maybe
you,
Let
me
know
how
she
is.
Nobody
is
fucking
me!
I
don't
know
what
I
was
thinking
...but
being
that
I've
decided
to
...sorry
for
the
inconvenience,
You're
breaking
up
with
us?
Who
the
hell
do
you
think
You
can't
just
go
around
I
fell
in
love
with
you!
Guys
like
us
just
don't
fall
out
Beautiful,
naked,
big-tittied
women
No
heartbeat.
Think
someone
threw
him
out
a
plane
...like
in
Con
Air?
-
Did
you
ever
see
that
flick?
-
Con
Air?
Con
Shit.
-
Sounds
familiar.
Yeah,
it's
Rufus.
He's
the
fucking
undead!
Hey!
What
I
just
did
gave
me
So
if
you
don't
pipe
down,
I'm
gonna
Speaking
of
which,
-
Rufus,
is
it?
It's
usually
Long
Rufus,
but
it's
Big
Papa,
how
about
lending
a
brother
Dude,
he
fell
out
of
thin
air.
Dude,
his
piece
is
gonna
be
rubbing
-
Dude!
I'll
do
my
best
to
tuck
it
back.
It's
been
a
while
since
physics
...the
impact
with
which
you
hit
Death
is
a
worry
of
the
living.
The
dead,
like
myself,
only
worry
-
Told
you
he
was
the
undead.
I
died.
Christ
told
me
the
secret
We
were
at
this
wedding
in
Canaan.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Christ?
You
knew
Christ?
Knew
him?
Let
me
guess.
-
You're
another
angel?
I'm
a
man,
just
like
you
and
him.
At
least
I
was
a
man.
Been
dead
nearly
2000
years.
No
wonder
he
saw
Jesus.
It's
not
a
joint.
I
can't
read
this.
It's
Aramaic.
It
says,
Freaked
me
out
because
he
basically
Took
all
the
flavor
out
of
Let's
say
we
continue
this
discussion
I'm
starving.
Back
off,
Kato.
Wait
a
second!
Between
guys
with
wings,
...and
guys
trying
like
hell
...I
think
I've
been
a
pretty
good
sport
But
I'm
not
going
anywhere
until
Me?
I
came
from
heaven.
Now
let's
start
walking.
Walk?
Fuck
you!
Do
you
know
Hey,
man,
back
in
the
old
days
Did
you
ever
hear
of
What
the
hell's
an
apostle?
Let
me
get
this
straight.
She's
already
met
the
prophets...
...and
the
apostle's
with
them?
I
think
that
our
best
course
...is
to
ensure
that
our
parcel
And
being
that
I
can't
even
...well,
I'm
left
with
no
choice...
...but
to
seek
outside
assistance
I'm
gonna
have
to
summon
I
appreciate
the
loan.
I
remember
when
all
we
had
-
What
do
you
call
this
shit?
Now,
how
about
you
start
...how
did
you
find
us?
You
know
what
the
dead
do
Watch
the
living.
I
can't
wait
to
die.
And
why
are
you
watching
me?
Because
you're
gonna
help
me
...in
that
book
-
Hustler?
-
What's
your
beef
with
the
Bible?
Neither
are
we.
You
don't
But
I'm
supposed
to
be
in
it.
I've
gone
to
church
my
whole
life
and
Yeah,
but
you
heard
of
Yeah,
all
white
boys,
I
might
add.
And
why
is
that?
But
you
know
what?
I'm
mainly
here
to
correct
a
major
error
-
What's
that?
I
don't
buy
it.
If
that's
true,
why
did
he
get
Well,
he
is
the
son
of
God.
Kind
of
hard
to
have
So
you
fudge
a
few
facts,
Leaving
me
out's
okay
because
you
You
gonna
listen
to
this
shit?
That's
what
the
good
people
...right
before
they
stoned
my
ass.
You
were
martyred?
That's
one
way
of
putting
it.
Another
way
is
to
say
I
was
White
folks
only
wanna
hear
Life
eternal,
But
as
soon
as
you
hear
...from
a
black
Jesus,
you
freak.
And
that,
my
friends,
A
black
man
can
steal
your
stereo,
Gonna
eat
that
hash
brown?
So
you
went
to
heaven?
Damn
right
I
went
to
heaven!
In
the
three
years
I
followed
his
ass
Hell,
no.
And
I
was
in
my
prime.
I
could
have
been
knee-deep
...not
to
mention
fine-ass
She
had
a
thing
for
dark
meat.
Maybe
this
is
just
me
talking,
...I
wouldn't
care
what
the
Bible
said
The
message
is
what
counts.
But
folks
who
build
their
faith
And
all
my
rabble-rousing
So
I'm
gonna
need
That's
why
I'm
gonna
help
stop
those
...in
exchange
for
you
helping
me
How
do
you
know
about
that,
-
Isn't
much
I
don't
know
about
you.
When
you
were
5,
you
let
a
kid
You
did
that
shit?
You're
nasty.
I
never
told
anybody
about
that.
Neither
did
he.
Two
years
later,
-
His
name
was
Brian
Johnson.
See,
your
exploits,
...are
well
documented
in
heaven.
Probably
hell
too.
Where
are
you
going?
Yo,
man,
tell
me
You
masturbate
more
Fuck.
Everyone
knows
that.
When
you
do
it,
-
Dude,
not
all
the
time.
Two-thirds
of
me
wants
to
Yesterday,
I
wasn't
sure
Now
I'm
up
to
my
ass
Let
me
let
you
in
God
hates
it
when
Oh,
well,
then
let's
ask
the
"prophets"
Where
did
those
two
assholes
go?
What
are
you
doing?
Proving
to
this
bastard
-
What?
We
gotta
get
moving.
The
train.
I'll
call
for
reservations.
I
thought
she
looked
familiar.
-
Who?
Morning,
shoppers.
Good
morning.
-
Has
anyone
seen
the
overnights?
-
We
creamed
them.
Last
night
was
a
rerun,
Do
I
smell
onions?
Excuse
me.
May
I
ask
what
you're
doing
You
may
proceed,
mon
ami.
I'm
gonna
have
to
start
My
friend
has
a
bit
of
a
penchant
Oh,
come
on!
Would
you
just
relax?
I'm
doing
it.
Mooby,
the
Golden
Calf.
Created
by
Nancy
Goldruff,
Bought
by
the
Complex
Corporation
Broadcast
nationally
Since
its
inception,
...16
records,
...and
a
library
Not
to
mention
...dubbed
"Mooby
World."
Did
I
miss
anything?
You
forgot
Mooby
Magazine.
Damn
it!
Now,
is
there
a
point
to
this?
You
and
your
board
are
idolaters.
I
can't
believe
you
forgot
That's
you.
Do
you
know
much
about
voodoo?
That's
a
fascinating
practice.
More
an
arrangement
...the
most
well-known
of
which...
...is
the
voodoo
doll.
You
see...
...a
mockup
of
an
individual
...to
various
pokes
and
prods.
The
desired
result
is
that
-
Call
security,
now!
All
lines
are
currently
down.
-
I
have
to
apologize...
You're
doing
it
again.
Stop.
You
are
responsible
...which
draws
worship
You
have
broken
More
than
that,
...passes
for
a
decent
human
being.
Your
continued
existence
Like
you,
Mr.
Burton.
Last
year,
you
cheated
on
your
wife
You
even
had
sex
...while
you
were
supposed
to
In
the
bed
that
you
Mr.
Newman.
You
got
your
girlfriend
drunk
...and
then
paid
a
kid
...to
have
sex
with
her
...just
so
you
could
break
up
...when
she
sobbingly
confessed
She
killed
herself
Mr.
Brace
disowned
his
gay
son.
Very
compassionate,
Mr.
Brace.
Mr.
Ray
put
his
mother
...and
used
the
profits
...to
buy
an
Oriental
rug
for
himself.
Heavens.
Mr.
Barker
flew
to
Thailand
...to
have
sex
with
Mr.
Holtzman
okayed
the
production
...from
materials
he
knew
...because
it
was,
survey
says...
...less
costly.
You,
on
the
other
hand...
...are
an
innocent.
You
lead
a
good
life.
Good
for
you.
But
you,
Mr.
Whitland...
...you
have
more
skeletons
in
I
cannot
even
mention
them
aloud.
You're
his
father,
you
sick
fuck.
-
Good.
That's
great
work.
Very
good.
Well...
...alone
at
last.
With
the
exception
of
...there
isn't
a
decent
human
being
Not
one.
Do
you
know
what
makes
Fear.
And
therein
lies
the
problem.
None
of
you
has
anything
You
rest
comfortably
in
seats
...hiding
behind
your
false
idol,
...lives
shrouded
in
secrecy,
But
not
from
God.
Forgot
my
little
voodoo
doll.
Man,
it
really
looks
Look,
if
I
believed
enough
in
this...
...I
wonder...
Come
on.
I
don't
believe
in
voodoo.
Voodoo.
But
I
do
believe
in
this.
Don't
run!
Don't
run!
Fakes!
Fakes!
All
of
you,
fakes!
"But
I
do
believe
in
this."
What
does
that
mean?
And
one
to
grow
on.
Gum?
Go
on.
It's
okay.
You've
done
nothing
wrong.
These
guys
were
fakes.
You're
a
pure
soul.
But
you
didn't
say
"God
bless
you"
Loki!
You're
getting
off
light.
-
Loki!
You're
so
lucky.
I
forgot
you
were
down
here.
Three
years
this
August.
Let
me
guess,
14th
apostle,
left
out
This
girl's
no
woman.
Oh.
Those
weren't
tits
What,
these?
You
should
know
better
than
anyone
The
tubby,
coat-wearing
What
traditionally
defines
a
woman
Her
legs.
But
as
you
can
see...
...I
lack
definition.
Hey,
they're
getting
a
free
show!
Oh,
God,
How
do
you
know...?
This
is
the
last
scion.
You're
kidding.
I'm
confused.
Bethany,
Serendipity
here
Nor
is
she,
by
any
means,
-
I
used
to
be
an
abstract.
I'm
a
muse,
stupid.
I
can't
take
much
more
of
this.
So
you,
what,
inspire
people?
What
just
went
down
It
doesn't
take
a
muse
to
inspire
I
used
to
specialize
For
example,
I'm
responsible
for
19
of
-
Nineteen?
The
one
about
the
kid
...burglars
trying
to
come
in
...I
had
nothing
to
do
Somebody
sold
their
soul
to
Satan
to
What
are
you
doing
stripping?
You
remember
why
I
left?
Because
you
were
tired
of
getting
So
I
opted
to
quit
being
a
muse
I
gave
my
two
weeks'
notice,
...and
got
sent
out
into
the
world
So,
what
happened?
Writer's
block.
Can
you
believe
it?
I
can
inspire
anyone
I
meet
and
give
...but
I
can't
keep
any
for
myself.
Her
quirky
sense
of
humor.
-
Whose?
-
You're
saying
God's
a
woman?
He's
always
referred
to
as
"him."
Well,
that's
not
how
I
wrote
it.
But
one
of
the
drawbacks
...is
that
you
have
no
say
The
people
that
held
the
pens
...and
all
the
penholders
were
men.
So
she
became
a
he.
The
whole
book's
gender-biased.
A
woman's
responsible
A
woman
cuts
Samson's
A
woman
asks
for
the
head
Read
that
book
again.
Women
are
bigger
antagonists
than
It
stinks.
Why
is
the
last
scion
here?
Bartleby
and
Loki.
-
Not
the
plenary-indulgence
loophole.
I
always
knew
that
thing
Leave
it
to
the
Catholics
You
have
issues
with
Catholicism,
I
have
issues
with
those
who
treat
God
...like
some
Catholics.
You
people
don't
celebrate
your
faith,
-
lf
we're
wrong,
what
religion
is
right?
No
denomination's
nailed
it
yet...
...because
they're
all
...that
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
have
Your
hearts
are
in
the
right
place,
Look,
they
made
me
and
Silent
Bob
Who
fucking
farted?
Not
born.
Shit
into
existence.
Sweet
Christ,
-
What
is
that
thing?
-
The
Golgothan.
A
shit
demon!
No
man
of
woman
born!
-
Friend
of
yours?
It
came
for
Bethany!
Smoke
that
motherfucker
Damn!
I
knew
I
was
gonna
Yo,
get
your
fucking
hand
back.
Represent!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Looks
like
we're
in
charge
Over
the
bar!
Come
on!
-
Where
did
that
thing
come
from?
The
hill
where
Christ
It
wasn't
just
Christ.
Christ
excluded,
they
were
criminals.
Whenever
the
crucified
expired,
...spilling
bowel
and
bladder
...the
result
of
which
is
The
Golgothan
shit
demon,
And
it's
here
for
you,
girlie.
-
Bob,
get
down!
-
You
the
man.
"Knocks
strong
odors
out."
-
Way
to
go,
biggie.
What?
Whoever
sent
this
might
send
more.
I
suggest
you
take
the
princess
I'll
try
to
get
something
If
he
tells
me
something,
Hello.
We'd
like
two
tickets
-
Jersey's
sold
out,
sir.
There's
one
same
time
tomorrow.
Don't
underestimate
the
staggering
...and
show
up
Nice.
Your
hard-on
for
smiting
...what
ought
to
be
the
relatively
simple
Bus,
schmus.
Why
should
we
fall
victim
to
gravity
-
You
mean
fly?
Fuck,
let's
use
them!
I
wouldn't
suggest
that.
You
see,
kids...
...you
wouldn't
want
to
look
like
Look
at
this
pimp.
I
said
I
was
coming
up
I
don't
have
much
time.
They
figure
-
What's
with
bringing
us
in
here?
Going
around
killing
people,
Don't
you
know
what's
going
on?
Well,
we're
going
home.
Really.
Are
you
so
clueless
as
to
think
-
Why
not?
Both
sides.
Above
and
below.
Orders
are
to
terminate
you
-
Really?
Because
you're
pissing
people
off,
Word
is
that
God's
pissed
off
...and
I
know
Lucifer's
pissed
because
...by
succeeding
where
he's
failed.
-
So
they're
just
gonna
kill
us?
That's
why
you
have
to
Tone
down
your
behavior.
Quit
killing
people.
-
Oh,
lighten
up.
Oh,
believe
it,
boys.
They've
even
got
the
last
scion
-
Really?
This
is
huge.
Your
reentry
They'll
stop
at
nothing
Meanwhile,
I
suggest
you
find
If
anything
else
comes
up,
Thank
you,
Azrael.
I
have
to
get
back
to
the
pit
And
remember,
incognito.
How
you
coping,
kid?
It's
weird.
Just
when
I
think
...something
wholly
unbelievable
Sometimes
I
wish
You
sound
like
the
man.
What's
he
like?
He
likes
to
listen
to
people
talk.
Christ
loved
to
sit
around
the
fire,
Whenever
we
were
going
on
...he
always
had
a
smile
His
oly
real
beef
with
mankind...
...is
the
shit
that
gets
carried
out
Wars,
bigotry,
televangelism.
The
big
one,
though,
He
said
mankind
got
it
all
wrong...
...by
taking
a
good
idea
You're
saying
having
beliefs
I
just
think
it's
better
You
can
change
an
idea.
People
die
for
it.
People
kill
for
it.
The
whole
of
existence
...because
of
the
Catholic
beliefs
Bartleby
and
Loki,
...are
exploiting
that
belief...
...and
if
they're
successful...
...you,
me,
all
of
this
All
over
a
belief.
I
haven't
seen
the
moron
twins
One
time
we
were
at
the
mall,
...and
he
went
flying
through
the
air,
It
was
fucked
up.
You
two
aren't
getting
into
No.
We're
just
about
to
smoke
a
fatty
...who
just
got
on
at
the
last
stop.
-
Hi.
So
Jay
tells
us
Hit
this
shit,
man.
It's
good
stuff.
Oh,
fuck.
That's
some
bad
shit,
dude.
You
hit
that?
Yeah,
you're
bad,
dude.
Bad
shit.
So
why
are
you
It's
just
this
thing
I
have
to
do.
We're
going
home.
Oh.
Do
you
two
live
together?
Unfortunately,
yes.
So
how
long
have
you
two
A
while.
He
can
be
pretty
flaky
sometimes,
How'd
you
meet?
We
were
stationed
together.
See,
that's
beautiful.
Everybody's
always
up
in
arms
Pardon?
There's
all
that
macho
bullshit
And
you
two
meet
there,
hook
up...
You
think
we're
lovers?
Oh,
God.
I'm
sorry.
-
I
just
assumed.
-
No.
My
ex-husband
sort
of
screwed
up
-
You're
divorced.
I
call
it
being
dumped.
I
was...
...dumped
once.
Don't
you
just
constantly
Like,
why
was
I
so
easy
And
you
wonder
if
the
other
party
...and
call
you
back.
And
they
always
tell
you
When
actually...
...it
hurts
more.
You
know
what
we
need?
What
do
we
need?
We
need
drinks.
We
need
a
lot
of
drinks.
Garon.
You're
saying
you
still
Every
Sunday.
Does
it...?
I
mean,
does
it
It
gives
me
time
to
balance
That's
what
I'm
saying.
People
don't
They
go
to
church
and
feel
bored...
...but
they
keep
going
every
week
I
am
so
buzzed.
When
do
you
think
I
remember
the
exact
moment.
I
was
on
the
phone
...and
she
was
trying
to
counsel
me
This
thing.
And
when
nothing
she
was
saying
...she
said:
"Bethany...
...God
has
a
plan."
I
was...
I
was
so
angry
with
her.
I
was
like:
"What
about
my
plans?"
You
know?
I
had
planned
to
have
a
family...
...with
my
husband.
Wasn't
that
plan
Apparently
not.
How
about
you?
A
long
time
ago.
One
day
God
just
stopped
listening.
I
kept
talking...
...but
I
got
the
distinct
impression
How
did
you
know
she
was
listening
Well,
I
guess
I
don't.
I
hate
thoughts
like
that.
But,
you
know,
Because
when
you're
a
kid
you
never
God's
in
heaven,
and
he's...
She's
always
got
her
eye
on
you.
I'd
give
anything
Guess
that's
why
Where
is
this
pilgrimage
to?
-
You
wouldn't
believe
me
if
I
told
you.
All
right,
but
I
warned
you.
Okay.
I'm
going
to
this
church
Really?
Kerwood
Mandel
to
car
three.
See,
I'm
supposed
to
stop
...from
going
into
the
church.
They're
trying...
Shit.
They're
trying
See,
they
got
tossed
...years
ago,
right?
And
if
they
get
back
in...
...it
proves
God
wrong...
...and
since
God
is
infallible...
...to
prove
her
wrong...
...would,
you
know,
May
I
have
your
attention,
please.
The
dining
car
will
be
closing
I
feel
so
stupid...
...just
saying
it.
The
thing
I
don't
get
is,
I
mean...
...how
am
I
supposed
to
stop
Two,
even!
I
guess
I'm
supposed
to
Maybe
you're
supposed
to
Oh,
yeah,
right.
Kill
them.
I
mean,
even
if
that
were
the
case,
...how
do
you
kill
an
angel,
Barry?
I
don't
suppose
it's
much
different
Where
the
hell
is
everybody?
-
The
apostle.
Rufus,
I
want
you
to
meet
Don't
be
such
a
show-off,
Barry.
Take
it
easy,
Bartleby.
-
We
can
talk
about
this.
After
all
this
time,
it
comes
down
Get
your
fucking
hands
off
me,
Save
it,
lady.
Five
minutes
ago
Loki!
Holy
shit.
The
apostle.
I
didn't
come
in
you,
Pete,
What
are
you
doing
here?
This
woman
has
to
stop
two
angels
-
She
means
us?
I'd
say
there's
a
pretty
good
chance.
You
haven't
thought
about
Consequences,
schmonsequences.
We're
going
home,
okay?
-
It's
not
a
matter
of
pride!
Are
you
high?
I
can't
kill
her
Fine.
I'll
kill
her
myself.
What,
I
fall
asleep
-
These
guys
are
fucking
flat-leavers.
Oh,
shit!
Jay!
Biggie!
The
door!
The
door!
Can't
we
talk
about
this?
Why
don't
I
just
get
off
No
ticket.
-
The
apostle
is
here.
Then
you
know
who
the
chick
was,
The
scion,
I
imagine!
Maybe
we
should
rethink
I
mean,
you
heard
the
guy.
And
Azrael
tells
us
we're
marked?
There's
more
to
this
I
was
close.
You
know?
I
was
so
close
You
know
how
I
felt?
Righteous.
Justified.
Eager,
even.
You
all
right?
My
eyes
are
open.
For
the
first
time
I
get
it.
When
that
little
innocent
girl
See,
in
the
beginning
it
was
Then
he
created
humans.
Ours
was
designed
to
be
...and
bowing
and
scraping
He
gave
them
more
He
gave
them
a
choice.
They
choose
to
acknowledge
God
All
this
time
...l've
felt
the
absence
...and
it's
pained
me,
And
why?
Had
we
been
given
free
will,
we
could
But
no,
we're
servants.
Okay.
You
know,
all
I'm
saying
here
is
that
Wake
up!
Humans
have
besmirched
They
were
given
paradise,
They
were
given
this
planet,
They
were
favored
best
...and
some
of
them
And
in
spite
of
it
all...
...he
has
shown
them
...at
every
turn.
What
about
us?
I
asked
you
once...
...to
lay
down
the
sword
What
was
the
result?
Our
expulsion
from
paradise.
Where
was
his
It's
not
right!
It's
not
fair!
We've
paid
our
debt!
Don't
you
think
it's
time?
Don't
you
think
it's
time
And
to
do
that,
I
think
we
may
have
to
Wait.
Wait,
wait.
Kill
them?
You're
talking
about
the
last
scion,
And
what
about
Jay
and
Bob?
Don't.
Don't,
my
friend.
See,
don't
let
your
sympathies
They
did
me
once.
Scion
or
not...
...she's
just
a
human...
...and
by
passing
through
that
arch
No
harm,
no
foul.
My
God.
What
did
you
say?
-
I've
heard
a
rant
like
this
before.
-
You
sound
like
the
morning
star.
You
sound
like
Lucifer,
man!
You're
not
talking
about
You're
talking
about
Well,
fuck
that.
I
have
seen
what
happens
to
the
proud
I'm
going
back
to
Wisconsin.
We're
going
home,
Loki...
...and
no
one,
not
you,
...is
gonna
make
that
otherwise.
Shit.
Why
couldn't
we
stay
on
the
train?
Very
basic
strategy.
If
your
enemies
know
where
you
are,
Why
are
we
enemies?
Well,
I
know
I'd
perceive
the
person
What
does
that
mean?
Since
when
I'm
tired
of
I'm
physically
and
psychologically
...and
I'm
ready
to
kick
back
...unless
you
come
clean
right
now.
Why
me?
Out
of
all
the
people
on
the
Imagine
you're
a
12-year-old
boy.
You're
told
you're
God's
only
son,
How
long
would
it
take
to
come
Maybe,
say,
18
years?
In
the
Bible,
Jesus
suddenly
goes
Now,
that's
some
pretty
bad
Where
are
the
volumes
of
text
I'll
tell
you
where.
They
were
offered
up
as
a
sacrifice
You
make
it
sound
like
...to
cover
up
Oh,
bullshit.
Any
important
material
...would
give
people
-
Why
would
they
leave
any
of
it
out?
-
His
mother
and
father.
Jesus
didn't
have
brothers
and
sisters.
Mary
gave
birth
to
Christ
without
But
she
did
have
a
husband.
Do
you
really
think
he
would've
stayed
...if
he
wasn't
getting
laid?
The
nature
of
God
and
the
virgin
birth,
But
to
believe
a
married
couple
never
Meaning?
The
blood
that
flows
...shares
a
chromosome
or
two
...with
the
one
you
call
Jesus.
Bethany,
you
are...
...the
great-great-great-great-
...great-great-grandniece
So
that
would
make
Bethany
I
can't
do
this
anymore.
Bethany,
where
you
gonna
go?
-
It's
bullshit.
It's
bullshit!
Let
her
go,
man.
Give
her
time.
Why?!
What
the
fuck
do
you
want
I
fucking
hate
you!
I
hate
you.
He
can't
hear
you,
you
know.
That's
why
we
needed
you.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
Would
you...?
Could
you
have
believed
me?
It
was
something
Only
after
everything
you've
seen...
...everything
you've
heard...
...could
you
possibly
be
able
I
don't
want
this.
It's
too
big.
That's
what
Jesus
said.
I
had
to
tell
him.
You
can
imagine
...not
to
be
able
...because
one
word
from
his
lips
So
I
had
to
deliver
the
news
...who
wanted
nothing
more
I
had
to
tell
this
little
boy
...and
it
meant
a
life
of
persecution
...at
the
hands
of
the
very
people
He
begged
me
to
take
it
all
back.
As
if
I
could.
He
begged
me
to
I'll
let
you
in
on
something,
Bethany,
If
I
had
the
power...
...I
would
have.
It's
unfair.
It's
unfair
to
ask
a
child
...and
to
ask
you
I
sympathize.
I
do.
But
I
can't.
This...
...is
who
you
are.
Everything
I
am
has
been
a
lie?
No,
no,
no.
Knowing
what
you
now
know
doesn't
You
are
Bethany
Sloane.
No
one
can
take
that
away
from
you,
All
this
means
is
The
incorporation
of
this
new
data
Be
who
you've
always
been.
Just...
...be
this
as
well...
...from
time
to
time.
Guess
this
means
To
say
the
least.
Do
you
mind
if
we
adjourn
...a
tad
more
habitable...
...and
a
bit
warmer?
Fuck,
man,
I
think
this
shit
Weren't
we
just
in
the
woods?
Going
out
in
style.
-
The
voice.
Now,
who's
this
motherfucker?
It's
the
voice
of
God.
Oh,
the
voice
of
God.
Funny
you
should
mention
that.
-
What?
...that
this
Bartleby-Loki
situation
was
Yes,
but
then
why
was
she
tapped?
You
know
those
constitutionals
"Constitutionals"?
I
think
we're
beyond
euphemisms
God's
a
skeeball
fanatic.
The
Lord
has
a
fancy
for
the
game.
He
assumes
a
human
form
Doesn't
say
where
he's
playing,
And
he
always
gives
his
free
points
Isn't
that
sweet?
But
she
hasn't
come
back
from
No,
she
hasn't...
...and
we've
been
He
could've
been
killed.
No,
there's
a
different
sort
Whomever
has
set
...and
is
keeping
them
...is
also
responsible
Were
he
to
be
killed
...he'd
have
returned
Someone
knew
enough...
...to
keep
him
biologically
alive...
...but
incapacitate
him
And
as
omnipotent
...I
have
to
admit
that
we're
We've
looked
everywhere
for
him.
I
tapped
her
because
I
thought
we'd
be
But
whoever
he
is
was
clever
enough
...as
opposed
to
showing
up
Could
it
be
Lucifer?
Not
Lucifer.
If
he
was,
he'd
have
made
And
I
know
he's
not
responsible
...because
he
has
just
as
much
to
lose
So,
what
do
we
do
now?
Well,
I
say
we
get
drunk,
Why
don't
we
just
ask
this
guy
I
beg
your
pardon?
It's
the
guy
in
charge
Cardinal
Glick?
Maybe
we
can
ask
him
If
it's
closed
that
day,
those
guys
Good
Lord.
The
little
stoner's
got
a
point.
Maybe
we
could
talk
this
guy
Glick
into
"We"?
Are
you
saying
you're
back
in,
I
wouldn't
want
to
let
the
family
down,
Well...
...the
prophets
finally
Mass
attendance
is
at
...but
if
we
can
let
them
know
the
...we
can
win
them
back,
Excuse
me.
Fill
them
pews,
people.
That's
the
key.
Hook
them
while
they're
young.
-
Kind
of
like
the
tobacco
industry.
We
really
appreciate
you
seeing
us
My
friends
and
I
have
been
traveling
...about
the
St.
Michael's
So
you
looking
to
help
out
We'd
like
you
to
cancel
I
beg
your
pardon.
There's
gonna
be
a
world
of
trouble
Are
you
pro-choice?
No,
no.
The
trouble's
not
from
us.
It's
from
renegade
angels
that
have
These
guys,
See,
padre,
it
goes
down
like
this.
These
guys
think
that
...they
can
go
straight
to
heaven.
You
want
me
to
call
off
Who
sent
you?
We
were
sent
Cute.
Really
cute.
Kids,
playtime
with
the
cardinal
-
Worked
for
Moses.
Your
Eminence,
it's
not
a
joke.
I'm
telling
you,
man,
The
Catholic
Church
Please!
What
about
the
Church's
And
its
platform
of
noninvolvement
All
right,
mistakes
were
made.
But
one
can
hardly
hold
the
current
...responsible
for
I'm
an
important
man
with
important
...so
if
you
please...
-
But
tomorrow...
Do
I
make
myself
clear?
Neither
you
nor
any
other
influence
...is
gonna
keep
this
thing
I
can
see
the
headlines
now...
...if
there
were
gonna
be
any.
"Existence
Erased."
Don't
worry
about
it.
Hand
it
over,
Silent
Bob.
What
up?
You
stole
the
cardinaI's
driver?
That's
what
he
gets
for
messing
with
That's
sort
of
sweet.
What
do
we
do
now
I
guess
we're
gonna
-
You
said
they
couldn't
be
killed.
They
won't
be
killed.
And
just
to
ensure
that,
...right
here,
until
those
two
idiots
Hey.
There's
only
...and
I'm
looking
right
at
him.
Muse!
Just
in
time
to
join
us
for
a
drink.
Hey.
Where'd
you
come
from?
-
Where'd
you
come
from?
Nothingness.
And
that's
where
I'm
returning
to
All
right,
Plato,
sounds
like
-
Let's
go.
Come
on,
barkeep,
just
one
drink.
I
was
trying
to
find
you
to
tell
you
Is
that
who
I
think
it
is?
-
None
other
than.
All
right,
one
drink.
Give
me
a...
...Holy
Bartender.
Never
heard
of
it.
He
doesn't
know
how
to
make
You
do,
don't
you,
Muse?
Don't.
Anybody?
No?
Well,
I
know
how
to
make
Get
it?
Sweet
Jesus,
Azrael!
Why?
Come
on,
demon!
Try
that
shit
Oh,
apostle,
you
maintain
...and
you
and
the
barkeep
won't
be
The
Christ
bitch
will
join
you.
Are
you
really
that
stupid?
You
do
know
what's
gonna
happen
I'm
actually
counting
on
it.
And
if
my
calculations
...the
pawns
are
moving
"Holy
Bartender."
I
get
it.
I'd
also
like
to
acknowledge
this
great
...for
coming
here
this
morning.
True,
she's
a
Protestant,
but
we're
Now,
let
me
just
tell
you
a
little
bit
...hundred-years-young
God's
house?
God
doesn't
live
here
anymore.
He's
grown
weary
He's
turned
a
deaf
ear
-
He
has
abandoned
you...
...his
favorites,
Hypocrites,
charlatans...
...prepare
to
taste
God's
wrath.
Maybe
we
should
just
leave.
You
wanted
your
body
count.
This
lot
is
rife
with
sin.
Officer
McGhee.
All
right,
mouthpiece...
...let's
leave
the
nice
cardinal
alone
Mr.
McGhee,
don't
make
me
angry.
You
wouldn't
like
me
Is
that
so?
Ladies
and
gentlemen...
...you
have
been
judged
as
guilty
of
...and
this
very
day...
...I
assure
you,
you
will
all
...in
blood.
-
Wings.
Now.
Do
it!
-
So
he's
a
muse
too?
He
was
kicked
out.
Ever
the
fucking
apple
polisher.
Then
what
happened?
Yes,
what?
Well,
Lucifer
just
had
to
start
Heaven
became
divided
...the
faithful
and
the
renegades.
Oh,
the
ethereal
plains
Angel
against
angel.
And
when
it
was
all
over,
But
Azrael
refused
to
fight.
He
remained
in
the
middle,
waiting
What
are
you,
No.
I
was
an
artist,
stupid!
I
was
inspiration!
A
muse
has
no
place
in
battle.
So
after
the
fallen
...God
turned
on
those
...and
Azrael
was
sent
down
...something
he
considers
Oh,
come
on.
Don't
tell
me
you
never
questioned
No.
It
never
bothered
me.
So
you
were
an
artist.
Big
deal!
Elvis
was
an
artist...
...but
that
didn't
stop
him
from
That's
why
he
is
the
king...
...and
you're
a
schmuck.
Nice.
So
all
this
is
about
revenge.
You're
gonna
unmake
existence
After
the
first
million
years?
No.
Escape
from
hell
So
I
studied
the
religions
and
waited
...which
it
finally
did...
...in
Catholicism.
Plenary
indulgence.
But
I
couldn't
exercise
it.
Demons
can't
become
human.
No,
we
can't
transubstantiate.
But
angels
can.
Bartleby
and
Loki.
After
that
it
was
a
simple
matter
...to
celebrate
their
centennial...
...and
when
it
finally
happened
I
sent
An
incantation
...kept
them
cloaked
And
aside
from
the
triplets
here
...no
soul
in
hell
had
a
clue
But
the
Almighty
...so
I
dispatched
him
Her.
And
how?
That's
the
only
thing
Oh,
no,
I've
seen
way
too
many
...that
you
never
reveal
...no
matter
how
close
The
only
X
factor
was
the
involvement
But
fat
lot
of
good
that
did,
right?
Powerless
to
stop
the
inevitable.
Look,
asshole,
I
don't
know
...but
if
you
succeed
everything
gets
Human,
have
you
ever
I
think
not.
I'd
rather
not
exist
And
if
everyone
has
to
Still
thinking
only
about
yourself...
...you
fucking
child!
Now,
now,
now.
Things
are
getting
Hey!
What
say
Yo,
put
on
Channel
9.
Actually,
I
was
thinking
more
Keep
rolling!
Keep
rolling!
I
repeat,
...have
laid
waste
to
St.
Michael's!
Bullets
don't
seem
to
affect
them!
The
remainder
of
the
crowd
...identifying
this
Now,
I'm
not
a
man
of
faith,
God,
please,
don't
come
any
closer!
No!
You
see
that?
I'd
be
pissed,
but
in
a
couple
minutes
Oh,
now
what
was
that
What?
Oh,
nothing.
I
had
something
in
my
eye.
Now
who's
the
fucking
child?
What
did
you
tell
him,
Are
you
serious?
You'd
have
him
assault
me
You
want
to
play?
Then
we'll
play.
One
side,
Red.
Go
ahead,
then.
Pick
it
up.
Come
on.
That's
it.
Take
a
shot.
Take
your
best
fucking
shot.
Seriously.
I'm
not
kidding.
Come
on,
bright
boy.
Don't
you
know
anything?
Bethany,
bless
the
sink!
-
What?
Bless
the
sink,
damn
it!
That's
what
you
get,
motherfucker.
But
I'm
a
fucking
demon.
What
just
happened?
He
said
it
himself:
Hit
a
demon
with
an
instrument
of
God,
Holy
shit!
No,
but
Glick's
the
kind
of
asshole
-
But
the
sink?
Sanctifying
is
just
Remind
me
to
try
the
water-to-wine
-
How
far
away
is
this
church?
-
Rufus,
grab
the
gun.
Take
the
bartender's
car.
The
whole
fucking
world's
against
us,
Oh,
my
God.
And
people
wonder
why
Are
we
too
late?
To
save
these
poor
schmucks?
Yeah.
But
we
still
exist.
Where
are
they?
They
could
already
be
So
if
they
come
out,
Are
you
fucking
shitting
me?
The
brother
is
gonna
shred
them
...ain't
you,
homey?
If
they
pass
through
that
arch,
And
if
they
die,
they
go
straight
up.
And,
hello!
-
Why
don't
they
kill
themselves?
Die
with
a
mortal
sin
and
you
burn.
Then
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
Friend
of
yours?
No,
that
was
a
cardinal.
You
can't
tell
from
his
face,
It's
one
of
them!
Don't
you
listen?
-
We
can't
touch
him!
He's
been
at
it
for
a
while
now.
Please!
Please!
We
ran
out
of
parishioners...
...so
he
just
started
picking
up
folk
This
is
just
eons
of
repression
If
only
they'd
let
us
jerk
off,
Take
a
step
back.
Let
me
go!
Why?
What
are
you
trying
to
prove?
-
All
these
people!
Jesus
Christ!
I
just
wanted
to
go
home.
But
him,
you
know...
...he
just
lost
it.
He
realized
who
you
were
He
just
snapped.
And
the
funny
thing
is,
this
guy
could
He
said
he
felt
sorry
Now
look
at
him.
This
guy's
fucking
drunker
Which
means
he's
human
now.
His
wings
have
been
cut
off.
Loki...
Loki.
The
muse?
Oh,
no
way!
I
haven't
seen
you...
What's
with
the
tits?
Can
I...
Have
you
walked
Tell
me.
Have
you
gone
in
and
No!
He's
back.
We
were
awaiting
your
arrival.
Bartleby,
wait.
Stop.
Listen
to
me.
You
can't
go
through
with
this.
If
you
go
back...
I've
become
aware
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
You
sick,
twisted
fuck!
Bethany.
You,
of
all
people,
should
understand
You
too
know
what
it
feels
like
But
you've
only
dealt
with
the
pain
I've
dealt
with
it
for
a
millennia.
And
while
you
never
see
...or
how
blissful
he
is
And
he
is.
-
seeing
you
people
every
day
on
this
...is
a
constant
reminder...
...that
though
my
kind
came
first...
...your
kind
was
most
revered.
And
while
you
know
forgiveness...
...we
know
only
regret.
The
lesson
must
be
taught.
All
are
accountable...
...even
God.
Soon
a
cadre
of
police
will
arrive...
...just
in
time
to
kill
us
Then
this
failed
experiment
...will
cease
to
be.
No.
Hey.
Hey!
No.
No.
I
can't
let
you
do
that,
Bartleby.
This
has
gone
too
far.
I
might
have
to
take
you
down.
It's
okay.
I'll
do
it.
My
compatriot.
Genocide
takes
a
lot
out
of
him.
He's
weakened.
You're
weak.
More
importantly,
...a
condition
which
carries
A
conscience...
...and...
...a
short
life
span.
I'm
sorry,
old
friend,
Oh,
my
God.
He's
lost
it.
-
We're
absolutely
fucked!
I
can't
believe
this
shit.
We're
on
the
brink
of
nonexistence
-
What
kind
of
deity
gets
kidnapped?
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
If
the
whole
world's
gonna
end,
-
You're
a
pig.
We
can
lay
here
all
comatose
like
that
...or
we
can
get
making
with
the
love.
Make
with
the
love.
No,
about
John
Doe
Jersey.
That
guy
they
won't
take
off
This
is
where
he's
at,
Where's
the
nearest
boardwalk?
I
ain't
got
time
to
win
you
a
prize.
-
Where
is
it?
-
Have
you
been
there?
We
were
about
to
fuck
on
the
carousel
-
Do
they
have
skeeball
there?
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
Whatever
you
do,
stall
Bartleby
Bob,
come
with
me.
Come
on!
-
How
am
I
supposed
to
do
that?
I
already
did,
but
it
takes
two
of
us!
I
repeat,
this
is
not
a
drill.
This
is
the
apocalypse.
Please
exit
the
hospital
Thank
you.
Hey,
Big
Bird!
Ready
for
the
counting
game?
No!
Count
the
shells,
Suck-a-Duck.
No
more
bullets.
Now,
what
the
fuck
Angels
have
to
cut
their
wings
off
You
just
did
him
a
favor,
stupid!
I
hope
you're
the
skeeball
type.
Oh,
Bartleby.
Was
Wisconsin
really
that
bad?
Bow
down,
stupid!
I'm
sorry.
Anyone
who
isn't
dead
...would
do
well
to
cover
their
ears
What
the
fuck?
Thank
you.
It
never
ends!
Get
off
of
me.
What
the
fuck
is
this
shit?
Who
the
fuck
are
you,
Lady?
Why
the
fuck
did
you
hug
my
head?
Quite
a
little
mouth
on
him,
What
the
fuck
is
this,
The
Piano?
I
believe
the
answers
that
you
seek
What
the
fuck
does
that
mean?
What
the
fuck
happened
Where
was
she?
Imprisoned
in
a
body.
Bethany
figured
it
all
out.
Hang
on
a
minute.
You
missed
a
bit.
Well,
then,
you
ready
You
ready
to
make
those
changes
We'll
see.
Muse?
Seeing
as
how
you
...you're
welcome
First
I
gotta
say
goodbye
to
Bethany.
Oh,
no.
Metatron,
is
she...?
Afraid
so.
One
of
the
drawbacks
to
being
But
no
matter.
All
is
being
taken
care
of.
How
so?
Wax
on,
wax
off.
How
did
I...?
She
can
rebuild
you.
She
has
the
technology.
She
can
make
you
better,
That's...
A
very
relieved
deity.
You
did
well,
little
girl.
Your
kind
always
does.
So
you
might
wanna
We're
gonna
need
you
I
know.
I'm
the
last
scion.
Well,
you're
half
right.
You
were
the
last
scion.
But
now...
...this...
...is
the
last
scion.
I'm
pregnant?
Can't
put
anything
past
you.
Take
care
of
that
parcel
for
us.
She
has
a
world
of
work
Thank
you
for...
...I
don't
know...
...everything.
God,
there's
a
million
things
...most
of
it
questioning
...and
that'd
be
arrogant
of
me,
But
there
is
one
I
need
to
ask.
I'm
sure
you
get
it
all
the
time,
but
Why
are
we
here?
Didn't
I
tell
you
she
was
funny?
I
really
enjoyed
meeting
you.
It
was
an
honor.
You
did
so
well.
I
told
you
she
was
a
woman.
She's
not
really
a
woman.
She's
not
really
anything.
She's
something,
all
right.
Crisis
of
faith
over?
I
think
I'm
now
burdened
When
it
rains,
it
pours.
Are
you
saying
you
believe?
No.
But
I
have
a
good
idea.
Yes.
The
man
was
right
about
you.
Now
I'm
gonna
go
home
And
if
you
clean
up
your
language...
...I
just
might
put
in
Thanks.
Why
don't
you
name
the
kid
Rufus.
Yo,
we
should
go
to
Quick
Stop.
You
guys
wanna
-
I
got
half
a
stalk
when
she
kissed
me.
I
couldn't
help
it.
The
bitch
was
hot.
You
can't
talk
to
me
that
way
anymore.
You're
pregnant?
Yo,
I
heard
pregnant
women
can
I'll
keep
that
in
mind.
So
that
would
make
Bethany
