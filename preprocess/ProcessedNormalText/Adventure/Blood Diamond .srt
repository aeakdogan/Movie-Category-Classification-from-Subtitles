want
me
to
stop?
Why
don't
we
go
back
to
your
place,
I'm
a
print
journalist.
I

Is
it

that
you
don't
care
...because
of
the

you
do?
People

Go!
Shit!
No!
No!
This
way.
This
way.
Stay
low.
Come
on.
Go,
go,
go.
Come
on.
Come
on!
It's
okay.
It's
okay,
it's
okay.
Fire!
-
Is
there
another
way?
So,
what
do
we
do?
-
You
are
RUF,
huh?
And
I
am
your
prisoner.
You
wanna
see
your
son
again,
don't
you?
Wait,
wait.
Wait.
Bring
that
pink
chicken
skin
Now
let
me
shoot
that
pink
ass,
boy.
Where
are
we
going?
Lungi's
under
government
control.
I'm
gonna
try
to
locate
a
sat
phone
I
have
agreed
to
nothing.
You're
in
a
bit
of
a
conundrum
there,
You
know
what
that
means?
So
you're
a
fisherman,
huh?
-
What
do
you
catch
mostly?
Come
on.
-
Hello.
Listen,
I'm
from
My
wallet,
my
credentials,
We
barely
got
out
with
our
lives.
Back
away
from
the
fence.
But
you
are
not
a
journalist.
I'm
trying
to
get
us
to
Kono.
-
Do
you
understand
that,
huh?
Listen,
I'm
coming
back.
How's
it,
my
bru?
-
Here.
I'm
looking
for
someone,
an
American
-
If
you
saw
her,
you
would
not
forget
it.
-
Is
it?
Can
you
tell
her
Danny
Archer's
looking
Okay,
but
I'm
going
out
for
a
bit.
Magic.
Listen,
we'll
be
-
Sweet.
Cheers,
bru.
It
is
as
I
said.
-
You
don't
mind
waiting?
-
Thank
you
so
much.
I'll
just
be
a
sec.
Hi.
You
got
out.
Yes.
Hello
again.
-
This
is
Solomon
Vandy.
-
Hello.
So
I'm
on
deadline.
I've
been
waiting
-
I've
got
someone
holding
my
place
in
line.
All
right.
Here
it
is.
-
There's
a
company
called
Tiara
Diamonds.
They
get
the
stones
Now,
Van
De
Kaap
...but
through
a
series
of
cross
holdings
-
...they
actually
own
it.
-
If
you
help
me
out,
yeah.
Before
you
say
anything,
His
entire
village
was
burned
down.
He's
been
working
in
the
mining
camps,
He
cannot
get
through
the
red
tape.
All
I'm
asking
is
this,
And
how
do
you
know
this
man?
-
I
know
him.
I
know
him.
You're
using
him.
I'm
using
him,
and
you
are
using
me,
Come
on.
Look,
you've
got
access
-
You
can
track
his
family
for
him.
This
whole
country's
at
war.
I
can't
believe
I
just
said
that.
My
family's
here,
in
Guinea?
Yes,
according
to
the
manifest.
I
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you.
Tassin
Camp
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
This
is
what
a
million
people
looks
like.
At
the
moment,
the
second
largest
Might
catch
a
minute
of
this
on
CNN,
-
Hello.
I've
spoken
with
Colonel
Coedoo...
...and
highlighted
the
names
-
Move
away.
Okay,
I'm
gonna
check
for
you.
-
Wait
me
there.
We
are
here
to
help
you.
This
woman
says
she
has
An
entire
country
made
homeless.

Jassie!
Jassie!

Jassie.
-
Jassie.
Jassie.
Jassie.
-
Solomon.
-
Solomon.
Where
is
Dia?
Dia.
Dia.
Where
is
Dia?
Where
is
my
son?
Jassie!
Where
is
my
son?
Where
is
my
son?
They
took
him.
They
took
him.
There
are
only
two
children
-
Where
is
my
son?
Where
is
my
son?
-
Away
from
the
fence.
Move
away
from
the
fence.
-
Let
them
out!
Let
them
out!
Let
them
out!
Let
them
out!
Let
them
out!
Away
from
the
fence.
-
They'll
shoot
you!
No!
Solo!
Do
you
want
your
wife
and
child
Solo!
Solo!
They
said
they're
concerned
that
...so
they
refused
to
release
them
I'm
so
sorry,
Solomon.
What
you
want,
Mr.
Archer,
...where
I
buried
it.
You
say
the
mine
is
on
the
Sewa
River.
Solomon.
I
do
not
need
a
map.
Yeah,
well,
I
do.
The
press
convoy
You
say
the
diamond
mine
is
up
here.
When
we
get
to
Kono,
You
damn
well
better
be
able
to
find
it.
My
son
is
a
very
good
student.
He
walks
five
kilometers
...every
morning
to
study
English.
He's
going
to
be
a
doctor
one
day.
"In
the
90-degree
heat,
...rattling
the
wire
-
What?
Do
you
think
I'm
exploiting
his
grief?
You're
right.
It's
shit.
It's
like
one
of
those
infomercials.
You
know,
the
little
black
babies
So
here
I've
got
dead
mothers,
It
might
be
enough
...maybe
even
write
a
check...
...but
it's
not
gonna
be
enough
I
am
sick
of
writing
about
victims,
Because
I
need
facts.
I
need
names.
I
need
dates.
People
back
home
...if
they
knew
it
cost
But
I
can't
write
that
story...
...until
I
get
facts
...which
is
to
say,
until
I
find
someone
So
if
that
is
not
you...
...and
you're
not
really
gonna
help
me,
...then
why
don't
you
get
the
fuck
...and
let
me
do
my
work?
Do
you
know
that
Solomon
thinks
Maybe
his
baby
dies
in
that
camp.
Who
knows,
maybe
both.
Do
you
realize
that
...is
the
only
chance
he
has
-
You
don't
give
a
rat's
ass
about
his
family.
Listen,
I
need
to
get
to
Kono,
all
right?
The
only
way
I'm
a
journalist,
-
No.
-
Please.
After
I
smuggle
the
stones
...local
buyers
get
them
Go
on.
He
pays
off
Customs
and
then
certifies
That
way,
they
can
be
legally
exported.
Now,
once
they've
reached
...diamonds
are
brought
...no
more
questions
are
asked.
By
the
time
they
get
to
India...
...the
dirty
stones
are
mixed
with
...and
then
they
become
And
Van
De
Kaap
Yeah.
When
I
get
to
London,
Supply
and
demand.
You
control
the
supply,
-
Agreed.
Now,
there's
an
underground
vault...
...where
they
put
all
the
stones
...so
they
can
keep
the
price
high.
If
rebels
wanna
flood
the
market
...a
company
like
Van
De
Kaap,
...can't
afford
to
let
that
happen.
Especially
when
they're
telling
...he's
supposed
to
shell
out
...for
an
engagement
ring.
Now,
technically
speaking,
...but
creating
a
situation
-
You
understand?
Names,
dates
and
numbered
accounts.
You
publish
one
word
of
this
story
...and
I'm
dead,
huh?
After
I
give
it
to
them,
If
you
don't
come
out
Then
write
whatever
you
want.
I'm
already
dead.
Now,
remember.
All
you
say
is,
Listen,
I
cannot
do
this.
-
Why
not?
-
Of
course
you're
not.
Because
you
do.
Because
that's
how
Now
get
on
the
bus.
Go.
I
am
the
cameraman.
You
are
writing
about
Yes.
So
when
people
in
your
country
read
it,
Probably
not.
-
You
heard
of
a
Stinger?
Your
friend,
Maddy.
She's
like
a
full-on,
I
mean,
I
saw
her
go
into
Afghanistan...
...like
about
200
clicks
When
the
military
said
no,
Came
back
with
3000
words,
-
Like
hot,
you
know?
Calm
down
to
the
frantic
now,
huh?
-
What's
that?
Looks
like
it
was
an
RPG.
Open
the
door.
Let
us
out.
-
Let's
go,
let's
go.
Go,
go!
Move,
move,
move!
We've
just
happened
upon
...fifteen
kilometers
-
...near
the
Moa
River...
...just
a
few
minutes
ago...
-
...an
ambulance
has...
-
Check
out
the
head
of
the
road.
--at
this
site.
Many
are
injured.
Get
back
on
the
bus,
huh?
-
Maddy!
Get
back
on
the
bus!
Solomon!
Solomon!
-
Let's
go.
-
Go,
go,
go.
-
Get
in
the
bus!
-
Move!
Get
in,
get
in.
-
Let
me
inside!
-
Let
them
on
the
bus.
What
if
we
just
take
your
place,
huh?
That's
enough.
He
can
ride
with
me.
Maddy!
Let's
go!
Nothing
like
a
little
bang-bang
-
Whatever
you
say,
Corbauld.
Story's
played
out,
hasn't
it?
No
one
gives
a
toss
anymore.
This
medicine
will
make
you
strong...
...make
you
invisible
to
your
enemies.
Bullets
will
bounce
off
you.
Superboy
Killer,
yes,
huh?
Foreigners
are
the
cause
of
the
problems.

I
am

I

No
More.
You'd
think
they'd
want
I'm
gonna
have
to
start
charging
Get
down!
-
Look
out!
-
You
all
right?
Shit!
Hold
on!
Hold
on!
Come
on.
-
Everyone
all
right,
huh?
Let
me
see
that.
You
okay?
-
Yeah.
Quietly,
now.
Quietly.
Come
on.
Kamajors.
Local
militia

Do
not
look
them
in
the
eye.
Who
are
you?
We
are
friends.
We
are
not
R.
U.
F.
!
We
will
kill
all
of
you!
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me?
Hi,
I'm
Maddy
Bowen
Wonder
if
I
could
take
your
picture.
I've
heard
about
your
struggle.
Would
you
mind
if
I
took
your
picture?
Everyone
could
all
come
in
together.
-Who
is
this
woman?
Is
that
okay?
If
you
come
over
here
and
come
in
Yeah.
That's
great.
There
you
go.
That's
perfect.
Reminds
me
of
my
wife.
How
about
one
together?
I'll
come
in
like
this,
yeah?
Cheese.
So
do
you
think
Shut
up.
Hey,
get
them,
get
them,
get
them.
-
I
got
a
score.
I
got
a
score.
Where
have
you
come
from?
-
Where
did
you
come
from?
That's
right.
Yeah.
I
don't
have
anything
for
you.
Don't
bother
the
people
now.
Thank
you,
Ubani.
You
can
leave
them
here.
1
take
Good.
Now
they
are
your
problem.
My
name
is
Benjamin
Margai.
Danny
Archer.
This
is
Maddy
Bowen.
-
Hello.
How
are
you?
Welcome
brother.
1
am
Solomon
Vandy,
from
Shenge.
What
should
1
make
of
your
companions?
He--
She
is...
They
are
journalits.
Ah.
And
1
suppose
you
are,
too.
I'm
the
cameraman?
The
Belgians
were
the
first
King
Leopold
took
one
hand
...to
keep
them
in
line.
Many
of
these
children
We
have
taken
them
back.
Some
of
them
have
been
We
are
trying
Let
me
show
you.
Imagine
doing
all
this,
huh?
What's
your
excuse?
Well,
it's
gotten
hard
to
go
back
So
you're
an
action
junkie,
huh?
Three
out
of
five
ex-boyfriends
...say
that
I
prefer
to
be
Maybe
I
just
give
a
shit.
You
were
good
today.
You
know
that?
You
too.
"--that
sometimes
they
forgot
She
also
wrote
...who
was
very
ill
Cheers.
So
how
many
attacks
I
have
known
most
of
the
rebels
The
local
commander
is
still
afraid
So
you
think
because
your
intentions
My
heart
always
told
me
My
experience
suggests
otherwise.
But
what
about
you,
Mr.
Archer?
In
your
long
career
as
a
journalist...
...would
you
say
that
people
No.
I'd
say
they're
just
people.
Exactly.
It
is
what
they
do
A
moment
of
love,
...can
give
meaning
to
a
life.
None
of
us
knows
which
path
Hey!
It's
palm
wine.
-
Jesus
Christ.
God.
-
Drank
that
as
a
boy.
I
take
notes.
The
Shona...
The
Shona
have
a
word
for
me.
-
It
means
"white
boy
in
Africa."
I
didn't
leave.
I
got
sent
away
to
South
Africa
Then
you
joined
the
army?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I
did
my
time
in
Angola.
-
The
32
Battalion.
You
know,
contrary
to
what
...we
fought
with
the
blacks,
huh?
There
was
no
apartheid
in
a
foxhole.
-
This
is
Colonel
Coetzee?
Then,
of
course,
it's
1994.
No
more
apartheid.
Truth
and
reconciliation
Kumbaya.
We
fought
and
died
together,
Black
and
white.
Most
people
back
home
We
thought
we
were
...but
in
the
end,
it
was
all
about
Ivory,
oil,
gold:
Diamonds.
So
one
day
I
decided,
"I'm
gonna
get
mine."
You
gonna
steal
his
diamond?
That
diamond
is
my
ticket
That
doesn't
answer
the
question.
My
dad
came
home
And
it
took
him...
...about
20
years
to
get
right.
What?
You
Americans
love
to
talk
So,
what
does
that
mean?
-
Got
a
thing
for
messed-up
vets
now?
You
lost
both
your
parents.
That's
a
polite
way
Mom
was
raped
and
shot...
...and
Dad
was
decapitated
I
was
9.
Boohoo,
right?
Sometimes
I
wonder...
...will
God
ever
forgive
us
Then
I
look
around
and
I
realize...
...God
left
this
place
a
long
time
ago.
It's...
What's
the
point,
huh?
Oh,
shit.
Keep
moving,
huh?
-
What?
Do
you
know
where
the
word
It
means
"child
soldier."
-
Stop!
Stop!
RUF
on
the
road!
Hello,
little
brothers.
-
RUF
on
the
road!
I'm
Dead
Body.
We
are
teachers
on
our
way
to
Kono.
Only
RUF
on
the
road.
-
RUF
only!
-
Only
RUF!
Don't
move!
Don't
move!
Fuck.
Jesus
Christ!
Maddy,
press
your
hand
-
Got
it.
Whatever
you
do,
Is
there
any
wine
left
in
that
jug?
-
Here.
The
colonel's
gonna
have
a
medic
-
How
far
is
it?
A
comedian,
huh?
-
How's
his
pulse?
-
Hold
it
right
there.
Papers,
please.
Excuse
me.
I
was
just
trying
-
He's
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
Will
you?
I'll
check
on
him
in
the
tent
Hey.
Look
who's
alive,
eh?
I
told
the
H
you'd
be
back.
I'm
afraid
we're
evacuating
Transport
touches
down
at
1600.
She's
with
me,
all
right?
No
exceptions,
pal.
This
is
gonna
be
ugly.
Is
I.R.'s
presence
here
-
She's
with
you?
Come
on.
The
colonel's
this
way.
Give
me
a
minute,
huh?
We
block
their
escape
That's
correct.
You
made
it
out.
Well
done.
Negative,
Kilo
Foxtrot,
stand
by.
-
Colonel,
sir.
The
pink.
Well,
you're
part
First
we
snuff
everything
that
moves
Colonel?
Go
get
kitted.
Yes?
Move,
move,
move!
-
Go
get
your
kit.
It's
go
time,
all
right?
How's
Benjamin?
They
say
he'll
live.
Good.
Good.
Listen,
Maddy...
...I
need
you
to
do
me
one
last
favor.
Yeah?
Tell
that
guard
...on
the
cover
of
Soldier
of
Fortune
You're
going
in.
You
and
Solomon.
You're
going
in
now.
Your
plane
leaves
You're
an
idiot.
-
What
if
I
wanted
to
go
in
with
you?
-
What
if
I
insist?
It's
my
story.
Your
story
is
Van
De
Kaap,
all
right?
I'm
not
leaving
here
without
it,
Please,
just
give
me
two
minutes.
Yeah.
-
Hello.
My
name
is
Maddy
Bowen.
I
was
wondering
Well,
that
depends
what
they
are.
Oh,
I
see
you're
familiar
Okay,
so
I'll
start
And
before
that
you
were
with
-
Defense
Force,
correct.
And
was
that
with
Colonel
Coetzee?
Angola,
yeah.
That
is
all
I
really
need
to
know.
-
Thank
you.
Thank
you,
huh?
Just
keeping
my
end
of
the
deal.
Good
luck
to
you,
Solomon.
Okay.
-
I
hope
you
find
what
you're
looking
for.
-
Listen,
I--
In
another
life
maybe,
all
right?
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
You
find
yourself
a
good
man,
You
know,
I've
got
three
sisters.
They're
all
married
to
good
men.
I
prefer
my
life.
Here
is
my
office
phone...
...home
phone,
cellphone.
I'm
used
to
being
pursued,
You
better
get
on
that
plane,
huh?
You
should
get
on
that
plane.
So
should
you.
You
gonna
call
me?
Soon
as
I'm
near
a
phone,
yeah.
Yeah,
right.
-
Where
is
he?
Oh,
shit.
Nabil?
Yeah,
I'll
call
you
You
keep
me
posted.
Right.
All
right.
I
set
the
pace,
huh?
If
I
hold
my
hand
up
like
this,
you
stop.
If
I
say
go,
you
move
like
your
life
-
Yes,
boss.
Tell
me
about
the
stone.
Is
it
clear
or
is
it
milky?
Clear.
And
the
color,
is
it
strong?
Does
it
hold
the
light?
It
is
as
you
say.
-
About
the
size
of
a
bird's
egg?
One
hundred
carats.
Dia!
Stop
the
truck!
I
thought
it
was
Dia.
Wake
up.
Don't
worry,
they're
gone,
huh?
You
know,
I
once
had
this
buddy...
...named
Mabhoko.
We
used
to
hunt
bush
meat
Baboons.
Baboons,
they
were
They're
cunning.
Cunning
creatures.
Fast,
strong.
Got
good
eyesight.
We
would
always
find
them
And
that's
how
we
learned
to
track
By
the
smell
of
your
shit.
It's
not...
It's
not
the
same
as
a
baboon's.
But,
you
know,
after
you
skin
it...
...the
flesh
of
a
baboon...
...isn't
that
much
different
I'll
tell
you,
I
can
track
anything.
You
risk
my
life
like
that
again...
...and
I'll
peel
your
face
Do
you
understand?
Make
us
a
fire.
Hello
my
brother.
Are
you
lost?
We
are
headed
for
the
mines
in
Kono.
You
don't
want
to
go
that
way.
The
Thank
you,
my
brother.
And
tell
the
poomui
not
to
shoot
me.
He
is
crazy
for
diamonds
like
everybody
else.
Let's
hope
they
don't
discover
oil
here.
Then
we'd
have
real
problems.
Thank
you,
my
brother.
What'd
he
say?
We
are
going
the
right
way.
Hold
up
there,
my
man.
Where
do
you
think
you
are
going?
Stop!
I
said,
stop!
He
is
not
down
there,
all
right?
All
right.
You're
gonna
need
Now
you
listen
here,
my
boy,
You
are
not
going
down
there.
You
are
not
the
master.
Right
now,
that
is
exactly
what
I
am,
Don't
you
fucking
move,
huh?
Don't
you
move.
Don't
you
move,
huh?
-
My
son
is
there!
-
He
is
alive!
He's
alive!
He's
there
I
am
his
father!
His
father!
I
must
go
find
him.
Shoot
me
if
you
want,
but
I'm
going.
Why
should
it
matter,
We
wait
until
dark,
huh?
Are
you
satisfied?
All
right,
come
on.

Go
tell
my
parents
In
the
battlefield
Go
tell
my
parents
In
the
battlefield...
You
are
how
old?
Me?
I'm
31.
And
you
have
no
wife?
-
No.
No.
And
no
home?
No.
But
you
have
money,
yes?
Yeah,
some.
But
not
enough?
No.
If
you
get
this
diamond,
Yes.
Then
you
will
get
Probably
not,
no.
What?
What?
I
am
confused.
Yeah?
That
makes
two
of
us,
my
bru.
Oh,
Christ.
Why
don't
you?
I'll
tell
you
what,
Solomon.
You
find
me
this
diamond,
-
You
were
born
in
Zimbabwe?
-
Is
it
beautiful
there?
Because
you
ask
a
hell
of
a
lot
My
grandfather
told
How
the
Mende
fought
the
Temne.
Or
how
two
tribes
would
fight
I
understand
white
people
But
how
can
my
own
people
I
know
good
people...
...who
say
there
is
something
...inside
our
black
skin.
That
we
were
better
off
But
my
son
is
good.
And
when
he
grows
up...
...and
peace
comes...
...this
place
will
be
a
paradise.
We'll
get
your
son
back,
huh?
Where
is
it
exactly?
Through
the
camp,
by
the
river.
Christ.
Okay.
I'm
gonna
make
contact
He'll
send
in
an
air
strike.
-
What
is
that?
-
We
use
it
as
a
diversion.
-
He
isn't.
I
said
we
do
it
my
way
now,
all
right?
Cordell,
it's
Danny.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You
tell
the
colonel
I've
found
the
stone.
No,
I
haven't
got
it
in
my
hands,
It's
a
major
rebel
camp,
my
man.
You
tell
him
to
send
in
the
dakadak.
Because
I
stole
a
GPS,
that's
how.
If
you
shut
up
and
listen,
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four,
north.
Three-two-seven-two-nine
I'll
call
back
at
midnight
to
confirm.
You
can
look
all
night,
I
promise
you
he
is
not
there.
They're
coming
in
the
morning,
all
right?
No
movement,
my
friend.
You
stay
still.
When
it
gets
dark,
Solomon.
Shit.
I
can
do
it.
-
Help
me.
Thank
you,
Papa.
Hey,
you
smell.
That's
fine.
-
Ready?
I'm
winning.
Play,
man.
-
Play.
Play
the
card.
Dia.
Leave
me
alone.
-
Dia.
I'm
your
papa.
Come
with
me.
-
Dia.
-
Dia.
Dia!
-
Enemy!
Enemy!
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
What's
wrong?
-
Dia,
come
with
me!
Get
away
from
me!
-
Get
him!
-
Don't
shoot!
Don't--!
Don't
shoot!
-
Fisherman!
Traitor!
Get
away
from
me!
I
knew
you
would
come
back.
I
have
dug
and
dug
and
dug,
Nothing.
Dig,
dig,
dig!
You
will
find
it
for
me.
You
will
dig
up
No.
Why
should
the
diamond
We
will
use
it
RUF
is
fighting
for
the
people!
RUF
is
fighting
for
Sierra
Leone!
Pick
it
up.
Why?
You
are
going
to
kill
me
anyway.
I
do
not
need
to
kill
you,
If
you
do
not
bring
me
the
diamond...
...I
will
find
the
rest
of
your
family.
Just
as
I
have
found
your
son.
I
will
rape
your
wife
...slit
her
throat...
...and
I
will
keep
your
daughters
You
think
I
am
a
devil...
...but
only
because
I
have
lived
in
hell.
I
want
to
get
out.
You
will
help
me.
I
don't
remember.
Find
it
or
your
family
will
die!
Now
pick
it
up!
-
Go!
Shoot
it!
Dia!
Come,
boy.
Come.
This
way.
This
way.
Dia!
Colonel,
we
think
Archer's
there.
I
don't
give
a
damn
who's
down
there.
Dia!
I'm
coming!
-
Dia!
No!
Dia!
-
We
found
his
digger,
sir.
-
Danny
boy.
-
Thanks
for
calling
it
in.
So
where
is
it?
The
stone?
We
split,
huh?
Fifty-fifty,
all
right?
Look
around
you,
Danny
boy.
You're
not
in
a
position
Then
you
will
never
find
it,
sir.
That's
correct.
-
But
he
will.
Introduce
me
to
your
digger.
Solomon
Vandy.
This
is
Colonel
Coetzee.
-
No
more
than
you.
You
gonna
show
us
where
it's
hidden?
Does
he
speak
English?
He
will
only
tell
me,
sir.
-
Let
me
talk
to
him,
huh?
All
right,
my
friend.
End
of
the
line
here,
huh?
-
You
just
tell
him
where
it
is,
all
right?
I
don't
trust
him
either,
I
promise
you
Right,
tell
him,
huh?
-
Go
on.
Come
on.
All
right.
I
said
tell
him
where
it
is!
Tell
him!
-
No.
Danny,
there
are
other
ways
Yeah,
yeah.
-
If
he
tells
us,
do
we
have
a
deal,
sir?
Sixty-forty.
I've
already
lined
up
a
buyer.
Agreed.
Come
here.
This
is
his
son.
Vandy
will
do
Danny,
you're
a
pisser,
man.
Well
done.
What
do
you
say,
Mr.
Vandy?
-
You
ready
to
take
a
walk?
Come
on.
So
who's
the
buyer?
Well,
they
no
longer
accept
Wouldn't
hurt
to
interest
-
Start
a
bidding
war.
I
missed
you,
Danny.
See?
It
is
here.
All
right,
Mr.
Vandy.
Hey,
boet,
have
you
got
a
smoke?
Smoking
will
kill
you.
Sorry.
It's
all
right.
Time
I
quit
smoking
anyway,
-
It's
gone.
Someone
has
taken
it.
This
is
where
I
buried
it.
Well,
then
there's
no
reason
Wait,
wait,
wait.
I
know,
I
know.
I
know
where
it
is.
-
I
know
where
it
is.
Yes.
Oh,
here,
here.
-
Yeah?
Yeah,
there
it
is.
Fuck!
TIA,
huh,
Danny?
TIA.
Keep
digging,
huh?
Keep
digging.
-
It
had
better
be
there,
huh?
Have
you
got
it?
-
Have
you
got
it,
huh?
Oh,
yes.
Solomon.
Dia,
what
are
you
doing?
Dia.
Look
at
me.
What
are
you
doing?
You
are
Dia
Vandy.
Of
the
proud
Mende
tribe.
You
are
a
good
boy
Your
mother
loves
you
so
much.
She
waits
by
the
fire
making
plantains...
...and
red
palm
oil
stew
...and
the
new
baby.
The
cows
wait
for
you.
And
Babu,
the
wild
dog
I
know
they
made
you
do
bad
things...
...but
you
are
not
a
bad
boy.
I
am
your
father...
...who
loves
you.
And
you
will
come
home
with
me
Solomon,
we've
got
to
move,
huh?
We've
got
to--
Go,
go!
Move!
Move.
Move.
Move,
move,
move!
Move!
Move!
Move!
How
far?
There's
an
airstrip
A
plane
will
meet
us,
huh?
Hey,
stop.
Stop.
Give
it
to
me.
Keep
moving.
They'll
be
tracking
us.
Nabil,
where
are
you?
I'm
nearly
there.
We're
about
10
K's
out,
huh?
-
Who
is
we?
Lose
them.
It's
at
the
top
of
that
ridge
there,
huh?
You
must
stop
and
rest.
What?
And
give
up
the
damn
stone?
Keep
moving.
Come
on.
Come.
Come,
come.
I
can't.
Stop.
-
Okay.
Come
on.
No!
God,
no.
Stop.
Christ.
No
more.
No
more.
Take
it,
huh?
-
Mr.
Archer--
I
thought
you
would
steal
it
from
me.
Yeah,
yeah,
it
occurred
to
me,
huh?
Listen...
...this
is
Maddy's
card,
huh?
You
call
her
when
And
don't
trust
that
pilot
for
a
second.
You
point
this
at
his
head
I
can
carry
you.
You
take
your
boy
home,
huh?
You
take
him
home,
huh?
-
Go!
Go!
Go
on!
Come
on.
Come
on.
Archer,
you're
a
dead
man!
Yeah,
yeah.
Dia.
Hello.
Maddy
Bowen.
Yeah.
Thought
I'd
never
call,
huh?
And
I'm
so
glad
you
did.
When
am
I
gonna
see
you?
Maddy,
I
want
you
to
do
me
I
want
you
to
go
meet
Solomon
In
Guinea?
We
found
his
son...
...but
he's
gonna
need
some
help,
Maddy?
You're
hurt.
Are
you
hurt?
Yeah,
well,
I've
got
Okay.
You--
Archer?
I'm
looking
at
an
incredible
view
I
wish
you
were
here,
Maddy.
Okay,
then
I'm
coming
to
be
with
you.
I
don't
think
so.
Are
you
still
in
Kono?
Because
I
can
Maddy,
you
find
someplace
safe
And
keep
him
out
of
sight.
And
get
Solomon
to
London.
He's
bringing
something
with
him.
But
he's
gonna
need
your
help.
Why
aren't
you
bringing
it
yourself?
I'm
saying
it's
a
real
story
now.
And
you
can
write
the
hell
out
of
it.
I'm
really
happy
I
met
you.
You
know
that?
Yeah,
I'm...
I'm
really
happy
I
met
you
too.
And
I
wish
I
could
be
there
with
you.
That's
all
right.
I'm
exactly
where
I'm
supposed
to
be.
When
we
get
to
the
stairs,
...and
I'll
wait
for
you
here.
You're
not
coming.
I'm
not
here.
Good
luck.
You
must
understand,
Mr.
Vandy...
...that
your
diamond
could
have
ended
up
-
It
is
not
enough.
...is
more
than
anyone
else
will
offer
you
I
want
what
was
promised
to
me
-
What
was
promised
to
you?
When
they
are
here,
I
will
have
the
money
too.
Well,
may
I
see
what
I'm
buying?
You
will
get
the
stone
How
do
I
even
know
you've
got
it?
Can
you
comment
on
the
diamonds
I'm
not
going
to
comment
-
What
about
Liberia?

Van
De
Kaap--
