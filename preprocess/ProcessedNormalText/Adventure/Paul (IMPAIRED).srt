Go
on,
then,
Paul.
Don't
be
long.

YOUNG

Paul?

Paul?
Paul.







-
He
winked
at
me!
He
winked
at
me!
I
love
it
here.
You
know,
it
feels
so...
-
Right.
We're
5,339
miles
from
home
and
yet,
somehow,
I
feel
like
we
belong.
I
know
what
you
mean.
I
think
this
is
probably
I'm
so
glad
we
came,
Clive.
Clive?
-
May
I?
-
Thank
you.
That
there
is
the
Black
Vampire.
Watch
out.
She
bites.
How
much?
$1,349.99.
Aren't
you
gonna
get
it?

Fair
enough.
I
can't
believe
we're
gonna

I
know.
Thank
you.
Come
forth.
Welcome,
my
friends.
I
just
wanted
to
say
that
the
Planet
Fall
on
me
and
on
my
work.
And
Sebastian
Rico
is
Don't
tell
me.
You're
a
writer.
-
I
am,
yeah.
He
actually
won
a
Nebulon
Award
in
1992.
-
I'm
working
on
a
follow-up.
Oh,
I'd
love
to
see
that.
Not
today.
No,
no.
It's
a
legal
thing.
I'm
sure
it's
good.
That
is
a
wonderful
cover.
Three
tits.
Awesome.
-
That
was
Graeme,
my
illustrator.
-
Move
along,
please,
guys.
-
Very
nice
to
meet
you.
Thank
you.
-
You
bought
a
book?
Then
fuck
off.
Let's
get
a
picture
of
you,
me
and
Adam.
-
Okay,
ready.
-


GRAEME:
Yes.
Yes.
-
Is
that
the
RV
place?
And
there's
definitely
two
single
beds?
Because
there's
been
Okay.
Excellent.
Thank
you
very
much.
And
have
a
nice
day
to
you,
as
well.
-
Is
it
here?
I
think
you
mean
"the
parking
lot."

I
sure
do.
I
did
my
American
voice.

It's
amazing,
isn't
it?
Huh?
How
long
have
we
dreamt
about
this?
-
Since
we
were
kids.
Now
look
at
us.
Grown
men.

BOTH:
Pizza!
-
Hi!
-
Good
evening,
sir.
-
Where
can
I
set
this
down?
You
guys
on
honeymoon?

No.
No,
silly.
We're
just
friends.
GRAEME:
We
had
a
mix-up.
Pop
it
on
the
table
here.
Let
me
clear
that.
-
Ah,
going
on
a
road
trip?
Well,
you
know,
than
a
tour
of
America's
Huh?
We're
going
to
Area
51
then
down
to
Camp
Verde,
and
then
on
down
to
Roswell,
New
Mexico
-
No.
Stop
it!
It's
an
alleged
site
at
this
point.
Why
would
they
admit
there
was
a
crash,
if
the
crash
happened
somewhere
else?
BOTH:
Let's
just
agree
to
disagree,
all
right?
That's
what
we
always
say
at
the
end.

Do
you
believe
in
aliens?
What
do
you
mean,
"aliens"?

I'll
sign
that
cheque,
shall
I?
Get
that
out
of
your
way.
Thank
you.
-
Have
a
nice
honeymoon.

That
one.


CLIVE:
Oh.
GRAEME:
Oh!
People!

GRAEME:
Smile.

"Watch
the
skies"
or
"Alien
on
board"?

"Alien
on
board,"
please.
Okay.
If
you're
sure.
So,
how
was
Comic-Con?
We
met
Adam
Shadowchild.
Who
the
hell
is
Adam
Shadowchild?
Oh,
he
wrote
The
Venusian
Pangenesis.
I
didn't
read
that
one.
Jenny
Starpepper
and
the
Great
Brass
Hen?
No.
The
Robot's
Mistress?
I
like
romances.
That's
kind
of
a
romance.
-
Between
a
woman
and
a
machine?
I
hear
that.

So,
you
fellows
set
Oh,
I
think
I
would
like
All
right,
then.
How
about
you,
pumpkin?
Can
I
have
an
E.T.
Malt,
please?
Mmm.
You
want
that
with
a
sparkler?
-
Yeah.
I
will
take
that
as
a
yes.
I
think
I
might
do
a
toilet.

Pretty
funny.
He's
sitting
right
there
on
top
of
that
bull,
and
he
goes,
"
Cut
her
loose."
What?
I
don't
know
you.
Ooh.
Comics.
JAKE:
What
was
that
about?
How
you
think
that
makes
me
feel?
Be
rude
to
me?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Ooh!
Eggy,
an
alien
just
sicked
up
in
my
palms.
Clive...
CLIVE:

What?
-
I'm
joking.
They've
got
a
soap
dispenser
in
there
-

Someone's
here.
PAT:
Here
it
comes!


What
in...
Hey,
fellas!
How
you
doing
today?
What
is
this,
some
kind
of
gay
bar?
No.
Just
a
place
and
maybe
share
a
close
encounter.
Yeah.
It
sounds
like
a
gay
bar.

Oh,
no,
we're
just
friends.
PAT:
So,
you
guys
look
like
You
go
do
that.
All
right.
You
do
that.
Yes.
Get
a
sip.
I'll
get
this.
GRAEME:
Just
leave
it.
CLIVE:
Thank
you
very
much.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Don't
you
put
those
queer
eyes
on
me.
I'm
not.
I
forgot
the
sticker.
What
took
you
so
long?
-
I
was
putting
the
sticker
on.
They
were
an
odd
pair,
weren't
they?
Yeah,
definitely
not
my
kind
of
people.
I
doubt
very
much
-

-
That
wasn't
their
truck,
was
it?
-
Should
I
go
and
have
a
look?
The
Black
Mailbox.
CLIVE:
Wow!
This
is
probably
the
coolest
thing
Do
you
remember
when
we
Googled
it
and
the
phone
rang
I
didn't
really
think
it
was
the
FBI.
-
You
started
crying.
We'd
only
been
to
Brussels.
Go
stand
next
to
it.
Yep.
Smile.

Very
good.
Hey,
imagine
if
we
got
buzzed
by
a
craft.
That
would
be
amazing,
wouldn't
it?
Smile!

What
would
you
do
if
they
actually
landed?
Well,
first
contact
They
come
in
peace,
we
go
to
pieces?
Uh-uh.
That's
not
how
I
roll.
-
No.

What's
that?
Do
you
think
that's
those
men?
No.
We've
seen
enough.
Let's
go.
Go,
go,
go!

Oh,
they're
gaining.
This
is
like
Deliverance!
They're
going
to
rape
us
and
break
our
arms!
I
don't
want
my
arms
broken!
-
I
need
the
toilet.
You
know
I've
got
a
child's
bladder.

Don't
let
them
get
past!
-
What
do
you
want
me
to
do,
ram
them?
-
It's
not
them!
It's
not
them!
-
Oh,
my
God.
-
That
was
awful!
That
was
terrifying!






GRAEME:
Hello?
-

Maybe
you
should
call
for
help.

It's
ringing.
PAUL:
I
wouldn't
do
that
if
I
were
you.



Put
the
phone
down.

Oh,
fuck
me.
-
What
have
you
done
to
him?

Yeah,
but
you
made
him
faint!
Yes.
But
it's
not
like
You've
got
a
phaser?
No,
I
don't...
Look!
Listen.
Hey,
I
really
need
your
help,
okay?
Can
we
get
this
guy
back
onto
your
wagon?

Are
you
an
alien?
To
you,
I
am,
yes.
Are
you
gonna
probe
us?
Why
does
everyone
always
assume
that?
What
am
I
doing?
Am
I
harvesting
farts?

What?
I'm
sorry.
What's
your
name?
It's
Graeme
Willy.
And
what's
his
name?
That's
the
writer,
Clive
Gollings.
Okay,
cool!
I'm
Paul.
Paul?
Yeah.
It's
a
nickname
that
stuck.
My
ship
crashed
on
a
dog.
It
doesn't
matter!
Look!
Can
we
get
the
writer,
and
get
the
hell
out
of
here,
please?
-
I
can't...
and
if
you
don't
help
me,
I
don't
know.

Look,
man.
What
do
you
say?
-
Okay.
Okay,
help
me
grab
him.
This
man
has
peed
his
pants.
Yeah,
he's
got
a
child's
bladder.
Oh,
fantastic.
Doesn't
this
thing
go
any
faster?
Well,
I'm
sorry,
the
speed
limit
is
70,
so...
Screw
the
speed
limit!
Actually,
no.
That's
good
thinking.
Okay?
How
come
I
can
understand
you?
Are
you
using
some
sort
of
Actually,
I'm
speaking
English,
I'm
sorry.
You're
in
shock
right
now.
I
understand
this
must
be
Just
act
normal
and
drive
north,
okay?
We
gotta
get
as
much
distance
as
we
can


WOMAN
ON
RADIO:
-
He's
gone.
ZOIL:
Looks
like
he
hitched
a
ride,
too.
-
What
do
you
mean?
Bastard
jacked
a
native?
Could
be
two.
Don't
you
think
this
is
all
Are
you
suggesting
he
knew?
Little
fucker
might
have
phoned
home.
There
might
even
be
a
rescue
party
Zoil,
we
need
to
break
out
the
big
guns.
Do
you
think
that
that's
wise?
a
hoo-ha.
WOMAN:
Maybe
you're
right.
Listen,
I
got
two
rookies
on
a
special
mission
I'll
have
them
set
up
a
roadblock.
These
are
just
civilians.
You
might
need
the
extra
muscle.
Just
keep
them
in
the
dark.
These
roads
can
be
treacherous
at
night.
People
get
into
accidents
all
the
time.
I
like
your
thinking.
Get
it
done.
Heads
up.
We
just
got
reassigned.
Nice.
What
about
the
sandwich?
-
She
said
we
can
share
it.
Mmm-hmm.






-

I
love
pistachios.
I
hate
it
when
you
get
a
closed
one,
right?
GRAEME:
I
usually
just
bite
them.
PAUL:
No.
You
don't
do
that
at
all.
You
tap
them,
if
they
don't
open
GRAEME:
No,
that's
mussels.
No,
it's
pistachios.
-
What
the
fuck?
What
are
you?

He's
okay.
He's
fine.
He's
friendly.

Aliens
aren't
called
"Paul."
Was
that
Klingon?
You
psychotic
nerd!
Paul
is
from
a
small
M-class
planet
in
the
northern
spiral
arm
Thank
you.
He
looks
too
obvious.
There's
a
reason
for
that,
Clive.
Over
the
last
60
years
the
human
race
on
lunchboxes
and
T-shirts
and
shit.
It's
in
case
our
species
do
meet,
I
did
not
have
a
spaz
attack!
-
GRAEME:
Don't
do
it
again!
Get
your
fucking
fingers
out
of
there!
-
Oh,
my
God!

Paul.
Paul?
O'R
EILLY:
Okay,
okay.
This
could
be
it.
HAGGARD:
I
don't
know.
-
What
brings
you
to
USA?
We've
been
to
Comic-Con.
-
HAGGARD:
Comic-Con?
Don't
tell
O'R
eilly.
-
He
loves
that
dweeb
shit.
You
guys
know
Benny
Hill?
-
No.
O'R
EILLY:
Oh,
my
God!
Look
at
this!
-
What?
HAGGARD:
What?
These
guys
have
met
Adam
Shadowchild.
Who
the
hell
is
Adam
Shadowchild?
He
wrote
The
Jupiter
Praxis.
What?
Jenny
Starpepper
Huh?
Night
of
the
Moths?
Are
you
speaking
English?
Brilliant!
What
was
he
like?
He
was
a
bit
intense.
Well,
he's
an
artist.
Let
me
see
this.
What
is
this,
nerd
porn?
-
No,
that's
Clive's...
Okay.
Ha.
Three
tits.
That's
awesome.
You
guys
should
have
given
her
four
tits.
That's
just
sick.
I
was
just
saying.
Hey,
do
you
think
this
is
it?
Doubtful.
What
else
did
you
find
in
there?
Not
much.
Just
some
pissy
jeans.
-
Clive's
got
a
child's...
Sorry.
-
Okay.
You
guys
can
go.
Can
I
have
my...
Thank
you
very
much.
May
I
ask
what
you're
searching
for?
No.
CLIVE:
Thank
you.
Come
on,
Graeme.

Way
to
go,
Dirty
Harry!
You
caught
that?
Did
I
catch
it?
Oh,
my
God.
-
Like
a
cold,
I
caught
it.
I
think
it's
pretty
obvious
Is
it?
The
government
used
some
kind
of
It
caused
us
to
suffer
It
makes
complete
sense.
-
PAUL:
Wrong!
-
Oh!
-

Your
dick
is
gone.
Oh,
no!
PAUL:
What?
Come
on,
grow
up.
How
did
you
do
that?
Oh,
it's
a
camouflage
response.
What,
like,
Predator?
Exactly!
Although
I
can
only
do
it
But
you
can
do
it
any
time
you
want?

Any
time.

-



Eh?
It's
all
right
for
you,
isn't
it?
We'll
be
arrested
for
harbouring
a
fugitive
Why
don't
I
go
make
Leave
you
two
alone.

What's
the
matter,
Clive?
There
is
an
alien
in
the
kitchenette,
-
Did
you
want
tea?
Right,
because
tea
is
weird
in
America.
-
They
leave
the
bag
in.
What's
weird,
Graeme,
is
the
fact
that
we've
and
you
seem
completely
fine
with
it!

Bagels
and
coffee
Ooh!
Marmite!
He
said
his
life's
in
danger.
Sometimes,
you've
just
gotta
roll
the
dice.
What
if
we
wake
up
and
find
him
Apparently,
they
don't
do
that.
PAUL:
Anyone
want
one
of
these?
Eh?
Anyone?
Anyone?
Eh?
Forty-eight,
49,
50.
Coming!
Ready
or
not,
you
son
of
a
bitch.
-
Where's
the
other
one?
Haggard!
Sorry,
it's
just,
we
were...
Haggard!

Fuck.

Nice.

Get
over
here.
We
were
just
playing
hide
and
seek,

Hurry
up!
I
was
hiding.

You
have
any
traffic
through
here?
No,
just
a
couple
of
hillbilly
types
Nerds,
huh?
Yes,
they
were
coming
from
Comic-Con.
Who
the
hell
is
Adam
Shadowchild?
He
wrote
Prisonhulk
Four-Forty-One,
okay?
Jenny
Starpepper
and
the
Spitting
Worm.
You
know
you're
a
grown
man,
right?
Probably
shave,
pay
taxes,
have
pubic
hair?
All
of
those
things.
-
Did
you
search
that
vehicle?
-
What
did
you
find?
Just
a
book
with
a
green
woman
Titties.
Three
titties.
Three
tits.
That's
awesome.
Oh,
and
some
pissy
jeans.
-
Guy
pissed
himself.
I
don't
know
if
he
had
Listen
to
me,
Frik
and
Fuck.
I
want
everything
you
can
remember
We're
leaving.
What
about
the
roadblock,
sir?
It
didn't
work.
-

Hey!
Reese's
Pieces!
Yes!
Thank
you.

CHRIS:
I
heard
there
was
a
commotion
TROOPER:
Funny,
I
didn't
hear
nothing.
-
It
must
have
been
the
boys
out
at
the
base.
-
Hey.

-
That's
a
bit
much,
isn't
it?
Put
it
all
back.
-
What
about
Paul's
Reese's
Pieces?
No,
you
go
right
ahead.
Are
you
sure?
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
-
That
beast
outside
yours?
-
GRAEME:
What
do
you
mean
"beast"?
Oh,
the...
Yes.
The
RV
is...
No...
Yes.
Where
are
you
boys
from?
-
England.
I
heard
about
England.
No
guns.
-
Not
many.
Just,
you
know,
farmers.
How
are
police
supposed
to
shoot
anybody?
-
They
don't.

That'll
be
$15.58.
$20.
Just
keep
the
change,
PAUL:
You
did
amazing,
Graeme!
That
cop
didn't
suspect
a
thing!
And,
Clive,
you
didn't
pee
your
pants.
I
don't
mean
to
be
a
stick
in
the
mud,
We've
only
just
met,
You
don't
think
we're
due
an
explanation?
Look,
the
less
you
guys
know,
the
better.
I
want
you
to
have
plausible
deniability.

Let's
just
say
I
spent
a
long
time
Turns
out
I
was
a
prisoner.
But
don't
worry.
I
got
it
all
under...


Fuck,
that
made
me
jump.
Poor
little
thing!
Nothing
you
could've
done,
mate.
What
you
doing?
PAUL:
Just
watch.




It's
a
miracle!

-

Man,
I'm
gonna
miss
these.
Mmm.

Why
would
you
do
that?
I'm
not
going
to
eat
a
dead
bird,
am
I?


PAUL:

You
got
me
thinking
that
I'm
wasting
my
time
Don't
bring
me
down
Come
on,
guys!
11:00,
12:00!
11:00,
12:00!
Come
on!
It's
fun!
If
you
think
about
it,
it's
time
travel.
11:00,
12:00!
Yes!
All
right!
PAUL:
Let
me
see.
You
gonna
draw
me

I'm
joking.
I'm
sorry.
Just
don't
make
me
look
fat,
okay?
Paul,
could
I
ask
you
a
question?
PAUL:
Shoot!
Have
you
ever
done
that
to
a
person?
Yes,
I've
eaten
many
people.
I'm
joking,
big
guy.
Relax.
No,
I
mean,
fix
them.
Oh.
No.
Not
a
dead
person.
Recently
dead
bird?
That's
one
thing.
It's
actually
really
dangerous
for
me.

Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Am
I
boring
you?
Are
you
tired,
Sausage?
Don't
call
me
that
in
front
of
him.
Are
you
tired,
though?
Eggy,
I'm
bushed.
You
know
what?
We're
all
tired.
Let's
just
pull
over
We're
fugitives,
Paul,
all
right?
I
refuse
to
just
sit
around
and
wait
PAUL:
We
just
gotta
find
somewhere
quiet.
CLIVE:

Oh,
you'll
know
it
when
you
see
it.
O'R
EILLY:
Two
white
guys?
O'R
EILLY:
Strange
white
guys.
Got
it.

Chocolate

WOMAN
ON
RADIO:
Zoil,
report.
We've
tracked
him
to
a
gas
station
in
Ely.
We
think
he
may
be
travelling
in
an
RV
WOMAN:
New
England?
Old
England.
Creepy.
What
are
they,
Ml6?
Negative.
Just
a
couple
of
nerds
Something
doesn't
feel
right.

I
want
those
nerds
iced
and
that
little
green
prick
ZOIL:
I'm
closing
in.
I
can
feel
it.
In
24
hours
he's
gonna
wish
GRAEME:
Okay.
Here
we
are.
PAUL:
Yeah,
this
looks
good.
It
doesn't
look
like

Awfully
quiet.
Quiet's
good,
Graeme.
Quiet's
our
friend.
Hi,
there.
-


There's
a
girl
outside.

Okay.
All
right.
Look.
We're
just
a
couple
of
regular
guys
on
a
tour
of
the
less
touristy
side
I
don't
think
she
heard
you.
I'm
talking
to
you.
Oh,
sorry.
Hi.
I'm
Ruth
Buggs.
Good
evening,
Ruth.
This
is
my
friend
and
cohort,
Hi.
Have
you
got
room?
Sure.
Yeah,
park
in
bay
nine.
It's
$25
a
night,
including
hookups
and
I'll
need
an
ID
to
hold
onto.
Okay.

CLIVE:
There
you
go.
It's
my
passport.
The
UK.
I
love
the
UK.
-
GRAEME:
Have
you
been?
You
should
go.
Oh.
Okay.
No,
no,
I
meant,
you
should
go
to
London.
There's
a
lot
of
places
I
want
to
go.
MOSES:
Ruth!
Ruth!
Get
in
here!
I'll
be
by
in
the
morning
to
get
your
money
so
have
a
pleasant
evening
now,
won't
you?
CLIVE:
Thank
you.
-
Bye.
She
was
lovely.
Why
don't
you
just
marry
her,
then?
-
Boo!
PAUL:
Every
time,
it
works!
That
was
30
seconds
ago,
I
did
it.

-
MOSES:
What
took
you
so
long?
Well,
you
talk
too
much.
Sorry,
Papa.

Huh?
Hello.
-
You
want
a
cigarette?
-
Can
I
ask
you
something?
-
You
and
Graeme,
are
you
guys...
You
know...

You
know!
You
guys,
two
guys...

Fucking
kidding
me?



What
are
you...

-
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
No!
Why
do
people
keep
saying
that?
No,
I
was
just
wondering.
It's
totally
cool
if
you
are.
It's
all
about
the
pleasure
thing.
Why
are
you
here,
Paul?
Oh,
I
was
here
on
a
science
mission,
actually,
and
then
I
had
some
and
I
kind
of
crashed.

Lucky
for
me
though,
she
pulls
me
out
of
the
wreck.
Next
thing
I
know,
guys
arrive,

What
have
you
been
doing
here
I've
been
kicking
back,
man.
I've
been
advising
the
government.
Not
just
the
government.
SPIELBERG
ON
RADIO:
I
want
him
Something
messianic.
Okay,
Steven,
Yeah,
I
don't
know
what
that
is.
Oh.
Restoration
of
damaged
tissue
through
telepathic
manipulation
-
What's
that
mean?
Yeah,
right.
Healing.
By
touch,
or
something
like
that.
Maybe
his
finger
lights
up
at
the
end
Maybe.
You
know,
sometimes
Hey.
Trust
me.
You'd
be
surprised
how
much
over
the
last
60
years.
Agent
Mulder
was
right.
-
Agent
Mulder
was
my
idea!
-
Wow!
That's
cool.
Pump
that
shit,
Earth-man.
I
like
this
song.
Marvin's
my
boy.

Come
on.
Break
it
down
a
bit,
boys.
Don't
be
afraid.
Yeah,
look
at
me,
I'm
breaking
it
down.
Use
them
tongs.
Dance
with
those
tongs.
Stoke
the
fire!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Yes.

Yee-haw!


MOSES:
Ruth!
Prayers!
PAUL:
I
don't
know
the
words
to
this
song.
No
one
does!

PAUL:
Hey!
Guys,
let's
get
fucked
up.

-

Oh,
who's
knocking?
Stop
it.
-
What
are
you
doing?

PAUL:
I'll
hide
in
here.
-
Don't
come
out.
-
Who
is
it?
Ooh...
Don't
you
dare
open
that
door.
-
Hi.
Good
morning.
May
I
come
in?
-
No.
I
don't
think
you
should
come
in.
-
I'm
not
really
dressed.
So,
where's
the
other
one?
The
other
one?
It's
just...
Oh,
oh.
There
were
three
shadows
I
saw
-
The
other
one.
The
other
one.
PAUL:
I'm
in
the
can.
I
ate
a
closed
pistachio.

I'm
paying
for
it.

-
That's
a
nice
T-shirt.
It's
Jesus
shooting
Charles
Darwin.
Why
would
Jesus
Because
of
his
blasphemous
theories.
Are
you
men
of
God?
We're
men
of
science,
you
know.
We
believe
in
the
establishment
through
the
maelstrom
The
world
is
4,000
years
old
and
can
only
-
PAUL:
Oh,
that's
horseshit.

All
right,
well,
then,
please
explain
how
something
simply
just
comes
into
being.

PAUL:
It
didn't
just
come
into
being.
It
is
the
culmination
across
countless
species.

What
are
you
talking
about?
-
PAUL:
Evolution,
baby.
-
Blasphemy!
Nothing
that
you
can
say
in
the
sure
and
certain
knowledge
and
created
us
all
in
His
own
image.
-
Oh,
his
own
image?
Well,
I
got
a
question.
How
do
you
explain
me?

She's
going,
she's
falling.
Catch...
And
that's
Jenga.
-
Why
did
you
do
that?
We've
gone
through
this!
They
faint!
But
we're
going
to
have
to
No!
No!
This
is
America.
Kidnapping
a
Christian?
But
she's
seen
you.
Who
gives
a
shit?
No
one's
going
to
Let's
just
dump
her
on
the
road!
We
can't
risk
that!
If
we
take
her
with
us,
You'd
love
to
get
her
on
her
side,
That
doesn't
make
sense.
Look.
She'll
be
fine.
We're
quite
nice.
All
right.
What
about
my
passport?
Oh,
God!
You
guys.
PAUL:
Mmm-hmm.

No!



Oh,
shit.
Ruth,
what
in
the
Lord's
name...
-
Morning.


Go,
go,
go!
Oh,
fuck.

MOSES:
Show
yourself,
demon!
GRAEME:
Where
are
you?
Where
are
you?
PAUL:
Passport!
Passport!
Jump!
Jump!

-

What?
That's
actually
small
on
my
planet.


GRAEME:

Ruth?
Hello,
Ruth,
would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea?
Where
am
I?
Hey,
look
who's
awake.
Demon!
Demon!
GRAEME:

We're
sorry.
And
we'll
let
you
go
just
as
soon
as
we
can.
You've
been
deceived
-
He's
evil!
No,
he's
not
evil,
he's
just
a
bit
rude.
He's
from
another
world.
There's
only
one
world,
our
world!
If
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
my
existence
of
the
Abrahamic,
Judeo-Christian
God,
as
well
as
all
one-world
theologies.

-
You
can't
win
with
these
people!
Ruth,
just
listen
to
me,
for
one
second.
-


She's
talking
in
tongues
now?
Fuck
this.

-
Oh.

What
did
you
do
to
her?
I
just
transferred
via
a
tactile
psychokinetic
bridge.
Ooh,
wow,
could
you
do
me?
It
really
takes
it
out
of
me.
-
Oh,
go
on,
please.

Oh,
wow!
Oh,
yeah.
He
always
knew
what
was
going
on
'cause
his
mum
had
cable.
Fine,
pull
over.
I'll
do
you.
Absolutely
not.
No
spoilers.
MOSES:
I
didn't
call
the
government.
This
is
not
the
police's
area
of
expertise,
-
That
devil
took
my
daughter.
And
your
daughter's
name
is
Ruth,
is
it?
That's
right.
I
brought
her
up
ZOIL:
Do
you
have
a
photograph
of
Ruth,
sir?
Yeah.
She's
pretty
easy
to
spot.
She's
had
this
eye
thing
Do
you
have
a
phone
here
that
your
daughter
might
try
to
Yeah,
in
the
back.
Hey,
Peter
Parker.
Want
to
put
the
snappy

Right.
MOSES:
She'll
call
me
if
she
can.
ZOIL:
You
mentioned
they
went
east?
-

if
they
ain't
on
the
interstate.
There's
been
a
big-rig
spill...

ZOIL:
Here
we
go.
Boys,
to
the
car.
Sir,
you
mind
telling
us
Yeah,
what
are
we
looking
for?
I
told
you
this
is
a
need-to-know
operation.
Yes,
sir,
but...
Damn
it.

HAGGARD
ON
SCANNER:
ZOIL:
Hey,
just
do
Now
let's
go
find
that
crazy
old
bastard's
Ruth!
Ruth,
wait!
Leave
me
alone!
Please,
please,
stop.
I've
got
shin
splints.

He
cannot
be
from
space!
He's
from
somewhere
else.
Ruth,
you
saw
it
for
yourself,
okay?
There's
probably
billions

So
where
is
everybody?
Hmm?
But
one
of
them's
there!
PAUL:
Are
they
looking?
Are
they
looking?
Are
they
looking
right
now?

Sorry.
That's
pathetic.
What's
your
beef,
Clive?
I
don't
have
a
beef.

I'm
from
outer
space.
We
should
be
best
buds.
It's
not
you.
It's
me.

Is
that
what
this
is?
You're
jealous?
Of
her?
CLIVE:
It's
not
just
that.
PAUL:
Whoa.
Of
me?
This
is
because
me
and
Graeme
got
two
minutes
of
face-time
-
Is
that
what
this
is?
I
have
dreamt
about
meeting
you

ever
since
I
saw
Mac
and
Me.
And
I
blew
it.
Now
you
two
are
friendly,
and
it's
like,
where
am
I?
Come
on,
man.
This
is
special.
You
guys
being
all
nerdy
and
shit
Who
cares
if
you
pissed
your
pants,
man?
When
I
first
got
here,
You
guys
are
weird
looking.
You
have
giant
bodies.
-
You're
just
being
nice
now.
Look,
you
want
a
little
sugar?

It's
just
knowledge
and
experience,
man.
You're
a
writer.
Will
it
hurt?
Only
if
you
struggle.
All
right.



So
there's
no
heaven.
Well...
-
I
can
drink?
-
I
can
fornicate?
-
I
can
curse?
-
Penises!
Assing,
hairy
boobs,
poop-farting
buttholes!
Ruth,
I'm
not
sure
this
is
helping.
What
are
you
doing?
-

Stop
it!

This
is
not...
Because
you
have
your
whole
life
Okay?
It
doesn't
necessarily
mean
You
said
you
wanted
to
travel,
I
really
think
you
should
come
with
us.
Where
would
I
sleep?
I'll
sleep
on
the
sofa.
But
I'd
push
the
tissues
off
with
a
pen,
Oh.

Ruth
has
decided

Wicked.
I'm
gonna
go
freshen
up.
Hey,
Ruth.
Wait
up.
You
don't
smoke.
I
just
wanted
to
say
thanks.
I
know
this
has
been
weird
for
you,
but
you
saved
my
life
Okay.
What
have
you
got
there,
by
the
way?
Severe
epiretinal
membrane
complicated
by
How
did
you
know
that?
Lucky
guess.
Do
you
mind
if
I
take
a
look
at
it
What
does
it
say
in
the
Old
Testament?
-
Wait,
I
don't...
-
I
don't
know...



Oh!
How
did
you
do
that?
Evolution,
baby.

-
Graeme?
GRAEME:
Oh,
my
God.
Clive.
-
CLIVE:
Oh,
my
God.

PAUL:
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Oh,
shit.
Damn
it.

-


PAUL:
Hey,
check
it
out!
Check
it
out!
-
Huh?
This
is
easy.

Small
corrections,
Paul.
PAUL:
Graeme,
hit
the
brakes!
Hey,
there,
sleepy
face!
Fuckeroo.
That
was
the
best
I
got
a
feeling
Look,
cursing's
fun.
Maybe
we
should
stop
for
some
food.
-
Fuck,
yeah!
You
bet
your
big,
fat
cock
I
am!
Nice!
CLIVE:
I'm
starving.
What's
new,
fatty?
-
It's
not
fat,
Paul,
it's
power.
-
So
rude.
RUTH:
Maybe
I
should
call
my
dad.
-
What?
I've
been
gone
for
a
whole
day
and
if
he
calls
the
police,
If
I
don't,
there's
a
good
chance
You're
really
getting
the
hang
of
this.
Thanks,
dick
milk.




-
I
won't
be
long.

-
ZOIL:
Ruth
Buggs?
Listen
to
me
carefully.
Who
is
this?
My
name
is
Agent
Zoil,
and
it's
very
important
that
you
tell
me
and
where
you
are
headed,
Ms
Buggs.
I
can't
tell
you.
I
mean,
I
don't
know.
You've
been
abducted.
And
the
individual
that
you're
travelling
with
Oh,
no,
he's
not
dangerous.
I
mean,
he's
kind
of
rude,
he
curses
a
lot,
and
a
couple
times

Please
listen
to
me.
and
we'd
like
to
get
you
home,
Ms
Buggs.
He
showed
me
things.
She's
talking
about
his
spaceman
balls.
You
know
I'm
just
trying
to
help
you,
I
don't
know
what's
real
any
more.
-
We
got
the
bitch!
ZOIL:
Damn
it,
Haggard!
Miss...
BOTH:
Hey.
Whoa,
slow
down
there,
baby.
-
Excuse
me,
I
have
to
get
to
my
friends.
I
got
a
friend
down
here
-
that
would
love
to
meet
you.
-
Me,
too.
What
the
fuck?
Shit!
Hey,
hey!
-
Hey.
-
We
gotta
go.
-
We
gotta
go
now!
Holy
shit!
It's
the
space
faggots
-
Yeah.
We
were
just
leaving.
-
JAKE:
I
don't
think
so.
GUS:
Oh,
shit!
Sailors!
-
Let's
go.
Excuse
me,
miss.
Papa?
Ruth?
My
Lord!
Your
eye!
-
Let's
go!
Let's
go,
boy!
JAKE:
Where
you
going,
girls?
Leave
us
alone,
you
stupid
vaginas!
That's
no
way
for
a
pretty
little
thing
She's
fairly
new
to
it,
to
be
honest.
Leave
this
to
me.
I'll
talk
to
them.

Yo,
fucknuts!
It's
probing
time.
Oh.

Ha!
Only
one
of
us
fainted.
Oh,
shit!
The
five-O!
Let's
bounce.
I'm
sorry.
They
answered
the
phone.
They
knew
about
us.
Get
in
the
RV.
-
Come
on,
they're
going
to
wake
up!
CLIVE:
Sorry!
PAUL:
Okay.
We
need
to
get
off
the
road.
-
Shouldn't
we
keep
moving?
That
is
exactly
what
they'll
expect
us
to
do.
Trust
me.
-
Yeah,
pull
in
here.
Perfect.
PAUL:
We're
idiots,
remember?
What
should
we
do
now?
How
about
a
hot
chocolate
and
bed?
What
are
you,
my
grandma?
Oh,
I
couldn't
sleep.
I'm
too
pumped.
Yeah,
me,
too.
Let's
get
some
beers.
What
do
you
say?
What
if
someone
sees
you?
It's
dead
out
there.
And
I
can
do
this.

Okay.
I'm
in.
-
PAUL:
Rocky?
PAUL:
Bullwinkle?
I'm
a
little
bit
tired.
PAUL:
Don't
be
a
pussy.

Don't
call
me
a...
All
right.

Just
get
your
hands
off
me!
ZOIL:
Hoss?
Something
I
can
help
you
with?
Yeah.
You
mind
telling
me
Just
a
good
old-fashioned
See
anything
unusual?
A
couple
hillbilly
types
in
the
back
Have
you
gentlemen
seen
-
Uh-uh.
Are
we
sure?
Mmm-hmm.
-
Thank
you.

RUTH:
It's
a
nice
window.

GRAEME:
That's
funny.
I'll
tell
you
what
else
is
funny,

-
Sorry.
I
was
like,
"Get
off
me,
you
rapist."
-
Do
it
again,
if
you
like.
I
said
you
can
do
it
again,
if
you
like.
Really?
If
you're
gonna
try
it,
then
maybe
rather
than
someone
like
a
stranger
because
there's
a
lot
of
weirdos
out
there.
I
am
planning
on
doing
a
lot
of
kissing
so
you'd
really
be
helping
me
out.
-
Great.
-

What,
now?
No,
I
did.
Let's
do
it
now.
-
I
mean...
Put
my
hands
on
you.
Just
stand
here?
Okay.
Hold
you
steady.
-

Fuck!
I'm
sorry.
I
thought
I
was
gonna
pass
out.
Carry
on.
-
What's
happening?
They
were
about
to
make
out.
We
were
just...
Good.
Please
put
your
shorts
on,
Paul.
You
guys
partake?
No,
thank
you.
I'll
partake.
Are
you
sure?
I
got
it
from
the
military,
actually.
Bob
Dylan's
not
dead.
Isn't
he?
Hit
me.
Okay.
Just
go
easy
on
it.
Ruth.
Just
a
little
bit.
Little
bit.
It's
not
so
bad.
To
be
fair,
-


I'm
hungry.
-
Do
we
have
any
sausages?
-
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
Why
do
you
guys
hate
me?
Ooh,
I
have
wasps
in
my
brain!

She'll
be
fine.
Paul.
I
was
wanting
to
ask.
Yeah.
Graeme,
we're
bona
fide
BFFs.


Why
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
to
leave
now?

Well,
according
to
the
government,
I
told
them
everything
I
know.
The
only
thing
I
have
left
The
healing,
the
thought
transfer,
In
order
to
cultivate
those
abilities,
And
I'm
not
really
down
with
that.
Lucky
for
me,
So,
I
managed
to
get
an
SOS
I
got
my
people
primed
Then,
motherfuckers
brought
my
whole
plan
goes
to
shit.
What
happened?
On
the
way
to
the
mental
labs,
I
zapped
Found
you
guys.
So
what
happens
if
you
get
caught?
Graeme,
they're
gonna
cut
out
my
brain.
Oh.
PAUL:
Yeah.
It's
fucked.
It's
kind
of
a
buzz-kill.
Let's
lighten
the
mood,
shall
we?
Oh.
Mmm.
-
Collectormania,
London,
'08.
Ewok
chick.

Clive
likes
boning
space
bears!

Shut
up.
No,
but
seriously,
be
honest
with
me.
What
was
it
like?
Well,
she
was
furry
nice.

That's
disgusting!
That's
gross.

-
PAUL:
Hey,
Clive.
No,
Boomer,
it's
forbidden.
Hey,
Clive.
-
Hey!
Let's
go,
guys!
We
gotta
get
out
of
here!



Where's
Ruth?
She
went
back
to
the
RV.

Of
course!
He
can
read
minds.
CLIVE:
Come
on.
PAUL:
Guys,
I
think
we
have
a
slight
problem
Oh,
man.
I
can't
hold
my
breath
Wait
here.
What?
Wait!
Good
morning.
Agent
Zoil,
Secret
Service.
You
mind
if
I
come
in
there
Not
at
all.
Morning.
-
PAUL:
Why
are
we
holding
hands?
PAUL:
Yeah,
the
fucking
Friedmans.
You
could
be
a
midget.
-
You're
obsessed
with
midgets!

Stop
it!
Just
act
normal.
We're
just
a
couple
of
regular
guys
walking
All
right,
Clive?
Clive?
-
Clive.

Clive,
what
are
you
doing?
PAUL:
Yeah,
man,
what
the
fuck?
I
want
it.
I
can
appreciate
it's
a
bargain,
but
this
is
PAUL:
It's
false
economy
anyway,
-
Why
would
I
ever
use
it?
Wait.
Maybe
we
should
go
inside.
GRAEME:
What?
You
go
back
and
get
Ruth.
You
sure?
Trust
me.


Good
morning.
Mind
if
I
come
in,
ask
you
a
few
questions?
Do
you
mind
if
we
just
do
it
right
here?
Okay.
This
place
is
a
real
cock-sucking
mess.
Got
it.
I'm
telling
you,
I
thought
all
that
Project
Blue
Book
stuff
No,
it
all
makes
sense.
All
this
hush-hush
crap?
-
The
drawing
that
I
found?
What
do
you
think
that
girl
Holy
shit!
Spaceman
balls!
Yeah.
And
who
has
spaceman
balls?
-
Buzz
Aldrin?



PAUL:
Hello,
handsome.
KEITH:
Is
that
you?
Uh,
huh?
Is
that
you
on
the
cover?

No.

-
What's
your
name?
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
I'm
Paul.
So,
you're
not
freaked
out
by
me?
-
Hmm.
Yes
and
no.
You
mind
taking
a
look
Tell
me
if
you
recognise
either
one
-
Ma'am?
Anything?
Anything
at
all?
Mmm-mmm.
-

You
really
think
this
is
an
alien?
-
This
is
huge!
This
is
huge!
Is
that
a
comic
book
shop?
Can
we
go
in
there?
Maybe.
If
you're
good.
Thanks
for
your
time,
Mrs...
Darwin.
Charlotte
Darwin.
Charlotte
Darwin.
You
have
a
great
day.

You
should
get
this
one.
-
Thanks.
Nice!
I
like
your
style,
Keith
Nash.
-
I
gotta
go.
Bye,
Paul.
Don't
get
caught.

Happy
trails.
Eh?
Huh!
Pretty
good.
Pretty
good.

How
much
is
that?
With
the
sword,
$299.99
plus
tax.
Yeah,
I'll
wear
it
now.

HAGGARD:
Come
on,
man,
let's
go!
I'll
be
right
out.

Should
have
used
the
cufflink
thing.
Spaceman
balls?

Get
your
goddamn
hands

It's
in
there!
It's
in
there!


CLIVE:
Hello.

O'R
eilly!
You
dumb
shit,

Holy
Mary,
Mother
of
God!
I
gotta
quit
smoking.

-
Let's
go!
Sorry,
ma'am!


-
Shit!
Hurry
up,
buttcracks!
Look,
it's
that
nerd.
Oh!
Oh,
yeah!
-
Who
was
that
kid?
Punch
it!
I
don't
know
what
happened!

-
Get
the
car
started!
Whoa,
whoa.
What's
going
on?
We
saw
it.
We
saw
the
alien.
It
was
in
the
comic
book
shop.
It's
hideous!
I
don't
know
what
you
guys
You
know
what?
You
know
exactly
what
we're
talking
about.
I'm
sick
and
tired
Where
the
fuck
did
he
go?
I
got
your
door
for
you.
I
got
mine.
He
went
with
those
nerds.
So,
you
want
to
follow
us,
big
guy?
-
You
kids
are
gonna
go
back
to
the
base.
Daddy's
gonna
stick
behind,
Now,
tell
me
which
way
-
North
East
highway.
Straight
home,
now.

RUTH:
Sorry,
guys.
It's
my
dad!
This
guy
doesn't
quit.
-
Oh,
God,
Graeme,
drive
faster.
-
Guys,
calm
down.
I
said,
calm
down!
Pull
over!
-
What
do
you
mean,
pull
over?
All
right.
That's
it.
This
is
too
dangerous.
-
What
do
you
mean?
I'll
boost
a
car
or
something.
You're
a
terrible
driver!
He's
right,
Paul.
I'm
close
now.
I'll
be
fine.
But
we've
come
all
this
way.
Yeah,
and
at
what
cost,
huh?
I've
shaken
your
faith.
I
just
want
to
get
home.
You
are
going
home.
I
think
we've
come
Yeah.
What
happened
to
BFFs?
You
bet
your
hairy
love
eggs
we
are.
The
last
72
hours
and
I'm
fucked
-
Yeah,
me,
too.
Well,
that
settles
it.
We're
all
fucked.
Thank
you
guys
so
much.
If
you're
absolutely
sure,
there
is

-
Seems
rather
fitting.
-
That
wasn't
difficult,
was
it?
-
Hello.
That'll
be
$299.99,
plus
tax.
-
Same
as
the
sword.
PAUL:
Look.
They're
running.
-
Get
the
door.
I've
been
driving
these
things
my
whole
life.

PAUL:
Come
on!
Get
in,
get
in.

Graceful.
WOMAN
ON

A

off
Son

Roger

Don't
make
me
come
out
there.
I'm

and
I'm

up
real
nice.
Where

anyway?
You
tell
me.
You

WOMAN

ZOIL:
You
don't
think...
WOMAN:
Son
of
a

is
going
back.
He's
gonna
try

make
contact.
Bring
me
back
my

and
I
guarantee
you
level

ZOIL:
Great.
Better
parking
space
I
don't
know,
man.
I
don't
know.
Fuck
him.
He's
a
dinosaur.
Okay.
We're
nearly
there.
This
is
where
we've
been
headed?
No.
I
just
need
to
make
Do
you
think
we've
really
got
time
This
is
something
I
really
have
to
do.
Okay,
stop
here.
This
is
good.

Shouldn't
we
park
a
bit
closer?
No.
We
don't
want
to
scare
her.
Scare
who?
GRAEME:
You
knock.
GRAEME:
I
always
knock.
TARA:
Who's
there?
Is
that
Tara
Walton?
TARA:
Leave
me
alone.

Ms
Walton,
my
name
is
Clive
Gollings.
I'm
here
with
my
friend,
Mr
Graeme
Willy.

And
what
do
you
want?
We're
here
with
the
alien
Let's
go.
Let's
just
go.
What
is
this?
Some
kind
of
a
joke?
Hey,
Tara.

You!

That's
a
very
loud
clock,
isn't
it?
You
have
a
nerve
showing
your
face
here
Maybe
I
should
make
some
tea.
TARA:
I'll
do
it.

Okay.
Look,
Tara.
I
only
just
stopped
believing
in
you,
I
spent
a
very
long
time
trying
to
convince
Everyone
said
I
was
mad!
They
told
me
it
was
a
meteor

They
said
that
But
I
knew
you
were
real!
I
pulled
you
from
that
spaceship
myself.
I
kept
you
warm
and
comfortable.
I
sat
there
with
you
till
the
men
came
When
word
got
out
about
my
story,
kids
used
to
come
and
throw
stones
And
I
just
hid
myself
away.
I'd
spend
whole
nights
up
there,
hoping
that
I'd
catch
a
glimpse
of
you.
And
here
you
are.
I'm
sorry.
Oh,
it's
okay.
You're
real.
That's
all
that
matters.

-
I
was
right.
And
all
those
folks
that
said
I
was
crazy?
They
can
all
just
go
fuck
themselves.

I
brought
something
for
you.
Here
you
go.

Oh,
thank
you.

Who
do
you
suppose
that
is?

-
CLIVE:
Where
did
that
come
from?
I'll
take
the
front!

Oh!

What
the
fuck
are
you
doing
here?
Go!
Go!

Haggard!
HAGGARD:
Alien!


Shit!
Haggard!
Where's
the
party,
man?
There's
no
one
in
this
place!
Oh,
fuck!
HAGGARD:
Freeze,
motherfucker!

So
weak.
Give
me
the
alien!
Give
me
the
fucking
alien!
-
No!
Give
me
the
alien!
Get
your
own
alien.



Thank
you,
Clive!
Is
Tara
with
us?
Tara!
Come
this
way!
Follow
us!
Oh,
man-balls!
It's
my
dad!
Are
you
okay?
Am
I
heavy?
I
told
you,
it's
not
fat,
it's
power!
Oh,
great.

I
told
you
we
should've
parked
closer!

Holster
that.
They're
mine!
-
Consider
that
a
warning!
O'R
EILLY:
I
got
you,
you
little
space
freak!
Ruth!
Get
back
here!
Just
go
home!
-
Oh,
I
got
you,
sucker.
Coming.
Ready
or
not.

PAUL:
Holy
fuck.

-
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
-

It's
okay,
he's
alive.
He's
okay!

-
Go,
Clive,
go!
You
okay?
-
Thank
you.
I'm
okay.


Graeme!
Ruth!
Drive!
CLIVE:
Come
on,
Graeme!
Don't
leave
me!
Never.
Graeme,
you
scared
the
shit
out
of
me.
Ruth,
why
aren't
you
driving?
I
told
you.
It's
easy!

Got
it.
Got
it.
Got
it.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Small
corrections!
Small
corrections!
Oh,
my
weed!

Oh!

Motherfucking
titty-sucking
two-balled
bitch!

WOMAN
ON
RADIO:
This
is
Haggard,
sir.
I
don't
give
a
shit
who's
in
command.
Just
ahead
of
me,
I
don't
wanna
hear
from
anybody
Yes,
sir.
Ma'am.
God
damn
it!
This
is
official
government
business!
Stand
down,
That
thing
has
my
daughter!
This
isn't
your
mission!
I'm
on
a
mission
from
God!
Tell
him
you
failed.
Oh!
Shit!
We
got
company.
He's
trying
to
overtake
us!
-
Don't
let
him
get
past!
-
What
about
the
deposit?
PAUL:
You're
crazy!

Fuck.

Oh,
fuck!
Come
on!
Smile,
you
son
of
a
bitch!
Eyes
forward,
butthorn.

Do
you
think
he'll
be
okay?
Yeah,
he'll
be
fine.

Mmm.
-
WOMAN
ON
RADIO:
Haggard.
Where
are
the
other
two?
One
crashed
and
burned,
Jesus
Christ!
I
should
have
handled
this
myself.
I
am
very
close.
You
give
me
one
hour.
An
hour?
I'll
be
eating
canaps
I
need
this
wrapped
up
now!
No,
no.
They're
mine,
damn
it.
Too
late,
Zoil.
I'm
bringing
in
the
big
guns.
Boring
conversation
anyway.
-

Fare
thee
well,
my
friend.
I
can't
believe
she's
gone.
Ain't
that
a
bag
of
tits.
Oh,
what'll
we
do
now,
Paul?
Paul?
-

PAUL:
See?
What
did
I
tell
you,
fellas?
-
You'd
know
it
when
you
saw
it.
Oh.
BOTH:
Of
course.
-
Ah!
Right.
Shoots
flaming
balls.
Whoo!
-
Can
you
just
light
the
fucking
thing?
-
What
is
the
suggested
safe
distance?
-
500
feet.
-
We're
not
gonna
enjoy
the
full
effect.
Hey,
what
the...
PAUL:

That's
not
funny.
That's
dangerous.


What
now?
We
wait.
Yes.
-
That's
amazing.
-
PAUL:
Not
bad.
That's
three
times
you've
done
that
now.
I
never
met
anyone...


Oh,
no,
you
don't.

Wait
a
minute.
WOMAN
ON
SPEAKER:
It's
the
Big
Guy.
Well,
what
do
you
know?
Small
world.
-
Paul!


Huh?

Don't
fucking
move!
Okay,
everyone
be
cool.
I
gotta
say,
I'm
a
little
hurt,
Agent
Zoil.
He
introduced
me
to
my
wife.
He's
my
friend.
You
stupid
son
of
a
bitch.
-
I
don't
want
to
be
where
you
are.
-
Let's
go,
Mork.
-
No.
No,
he's
going
nowhere.

Can
it,
nerds.
What
do
you
think
you
can
possibly
bring
Blind
fury.
-

Oh.
False
economy.
I
told
you.
Step
aside,
fag.

PAUL:
Oh!
Dude!
Insane!



Oh!
Ow!
Ow!


-
GRAEME:
Ruth!
Ow!

Zoil,
you
okay,
man?
-
So
much
for
the
plan,
huh?
Sorry
I
zapped
you
at
the
farmhouse.
That's
okay.
I'm
sorry
I
wasn't
there
By
the
time
I
got
there,
you'd
already
gone.
But
I
see
you
got
yourself
a
plan
B,
huh?
Did
I
ever.
These
are
my
friends.
-
CLIVE:
Hello.
-
You
did
a
hell
of
a
job.
Please
call
me
Lorenzo.
-
Lorenzo
Zoil?
That's
right.
MOSES:
Ruth!
Papa?
-
Paul!


That
was
close.
Oh,
my!
No!
-
Oh,
God,
Graeme.
Graeme!
-
I
never
meant
to...
Drop
the
fucking
gun,
Dad!
GRAEME:

Oh,
no!
I
really
liked
this
T-shirt.
CLIVE:
This
is
all
my
fault.
No,
no.
It's
fine.
It's
fine,
Clive.
We've
had
a
good
time,
haven't
we?
Yeah.
But
you
got
shot.
Yeah,
I
know.
But
I
can
honestly
say,
Clive,
Graeme?

CLIVE:
Graeme?
Graeme?
I've
gotta
try,
right?
-
Yeah?
ZOIL:
Paul,
think
about
this.




Paul!
Paul?
-

Oh,
that
sucked.
I
don't
even
get
to
eat
him.

Wasn't
that
really,
really
dangerous?
Sometimes,
you
just
gotta
roll
the
dice.
MOSES:
It's
a
miracle!

The
Lord
has
delivered
his
healing
hand!
You
can't
win
with
these
people.
-
Sorry
you
got
killed
by
my
dad.
-
Do
you
want
to
try
that
kiss
again?
Huh?

-

PAUL:
Oh!
I
changed
my
mind.
That
is
Jenga.

It
feels
better.
RUTH:
Oh,
that's
good.
-
This
is
a
nice
one
of
you.
Look,
Mr
Buggs.
It's
been
a
hell
of
a
ride,
huh?

Sorry
I
frightened
the
shit
out
of
you.
You
didn't
frighten
me.
You
freed
me.
I'm
glad.
Mmm.
That's
nice.
Thanks.
Hey,
take
care
of
her,
big
man.
Oh,
I
will,
sir.

God
be
with
you.
Yeah,
whatever,
dude.
Sure.
Say
bye
to
Karen
for
me.
Safe
trip,
Short
Round.
Thanks.

Oh,
you're
coming
with
me.
I
ruined
your
life,
Tara.
I
think
it's
only
right
I
give
you
a
new
one.
Oh.
I
don't
have
my
toothbrush.
Baby,
where
we're
going,

That's
right.
Right
on.
Get
in
there,
girl.
Yeah,
she's
cool.
She's
with
me.

Gentlemen.

I
meant
to
ask,
I
liked
it,
actually.
I
really
liked
it.
There's
lot
of
good
ideas
in
it.
I
kind
of
found
it
hard
to
finish,
to
be
honest.
Yeah.
Yeah,
me,
too.

-
Keep
it
for
the
journey
home,
if
you
like.

It's
safe
to
say
Be
yourselves.
Speak
from
your
heart.
Yeah,
you
know,
And
me.
Thank
you,
guys.
-
No,
thank
you.
Hugs?
Come
on.

I
can
feel
your
boner.
Till
next
time.
-
So
cool,
isn't
it?
PAUL:
Goodbye!
See
you!
Goodbye!

This
ship
takes
off
very
slowly.
Goodbye!
Can
you
guys
take
off
any
faster?

on!

was
good,
wasn't
it?

MAN:

Someone
who
loves
you.

I'm
very
proud
of
you,
Graeme.
Come

Pat
Stevens?
The
very
same.
You
know,
I
always
pictured
you
taller.
-
You
should
see
me
standing
up.
I
didn't
realise
you
were
so
damn
pretty.
You
should
see
me
I'd
like
that.
Mmm.
I
can't.
I
understand,
apparently,
Well,
fuck.
You
know...

Congratulations.
