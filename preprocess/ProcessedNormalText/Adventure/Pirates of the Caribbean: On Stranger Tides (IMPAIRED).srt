Yeah,

for

turns
out,
I
have
one.
I

Yes,
I
am.
What
is
it?

It's

Life!

Daughter

Then
it's

No,

that's
the
best

He
will

There
is
a
prophecy.
Maybe
you
don't

Oh,

no.
The
prophecy
is
this:
Blackbeard

That's
why
he
needs

Perhaps
you'd
be
so
kind
Be
a
gem
and

me
a

Nay.
We
be
privateers,
And
in
the
king's
name,
Aye,
Captain.
Be
we
on
the
proper
course,
Gibbs?
Aye,
it
be
proper.
There's
your
proof.
The

All

-
Two

Out!
Thrust!
Steady!
Guns

Sir.
Orders,
sir?
He
never
so
much
as
turned
his
head.
The
Fountain
is
the
prize.
It
appears
we
be
not
even
worth
And
now
we've
fallen
behind.
All
hands,
more

Ride
hard
between
wind
and
tide!
The
topic,
gentlemen,
is

Mutiny

Aye.
I

And

that.
And

Well
done.
On
to
it,
then.
Blackbeard.
-
What
are
his
habits?
That's
right,
mostly
to
his
cabin.
-
Yes,
but
when
he
comes
out...
He
must
come
out
sometime.
Not
really,
no.
Any
of
you
sail
with
him
before?
-
No,
no.
Definitely
not.
-
Any
of
you
seen
him
before?
Stays
to
his
cabin,
no
one's
seen
him...
Good
news,
gentlemen.
This
is
not

No,

How
do
you
know?
I've
seen
the

Gentlemen,
sirs,
fellow
conscriptees...
...you
have
been
monstrously
deceived.
-
We
are
decepted,
then?
You've
nay
been
informed
Death
lies
before
us
as
we
sail
for
the
Fountain
of
Youth.
It
would
be
a
sorry
plight,
mates.
-
Death,
for
certain.
-
Untimely
our
ends
will
be.
...we
take
the

We
take
the
ship,
then.
Now!
Go
on,
then.

Help
me,
shipmates!
-
Wake
up!
It's
ours!
Get
up!
Off
your
backside!
-
Get
off
your
fannies!
Help
me!
Fight!
Jack.
If
this
is
a
dream,
-
If
it's
not...
No,
it's
not!
I
thought
I
should
give
you
Nothing
personal.
Think
you
might
be
better
off
...stay
out
of
it.
Boggit.
Wretch!
You're
either
with
us
or
against
us!
I
am
not
with

Can
he
do
that?
He's
religious.
Fight
to
the
bitter
end,
Take
him,
men.
The
ship
is
ours!
Gentlemen.
I
be
placed
in
a
bewilderment.
There
I
were,
resting,
and
upon
a
sudden,
Sailors
abandon
their
posts
without
orders,
without
leave.
Men
before
the
mast,
taking
the
ship
for
themselves.
What
be
that,
First
Mate?
-
Mutiny,
Captain.
-
Mutiny!
Mutiny.
And
what
fate
befalls
mutineers?
Now,
we
know
the
answer
to
that,
Mutineers
hang!
Captain,
I
wish
to
report
a
mutiny.
I
can
name
fingers
and
point
names.
No
need,
Mr.
Sparrow.
They
are
sheep.
You,
their
shepherd.
Have
I
mentioned,
sir,
A
fitting
last
sight
for
a
doomed
soul.
Remember,
Father.
If
I
don't
kill
a
man
-
they
forget
who
I
am.
They
do
not
forget.
Your
crew
sees
you
A
coward,
no
matter
how
many
you
slay.
Twice
in
one
day,
You
are
not
bewildered,
you
are
afraid.
You
dare
not
walk
the
path
of
No,
sir.
The
truth
is
-
I
am
a
bad
man.
I
might
have
to
kill
you
too,
catechist.
-
No!
Father,
I
beg
you.
There
I
be
again,
My
daughter
fears
for
my
soul,
You
truly
wish
to
save
me,
my
child?
Every
soul
can
be
saved.
Be
that
true,
young
cleric?
Yes.
Though
you
I
see
Still,
I
pray
for
every
unfortunate
soul
You
disarm
me
with
your
faith.
Eight
bells!
Which
of
you
unfortunate
souls
-
I
did.
I
stood
watch.
You?
Aye.
Aye.
The
cook.
Perfect.
Lower
the
longboat!
Bring
her
about!
-
Why
do
you
do

Even

You

Aye?
I
am

sir,
among

Shut
your

That's
the
way
of
it,
then.
What
do
the

fear?

Aye,
Whitecap

And
every

Mermaids,
Captain.
Aye.
Mermaids.

Mermaid

that
be

Cling
to

Gibbs,

Steady,

Save

Man

Come
about.
Gentlemen,
I
shall
not
ask
that

can

but
I
do
ask
this:
Aye.
-
On
the
king's
mission?
I
did
not

in
the
eyes

Are
we
not

Aye!
Hands
all
off,
and

away!
Stave
on

to
Whitecap
Bay!
Bear
on,
Whitecap
Bay!
Come.
Little
drink?
Wine,
music,
candlelight.
I
think
we've
traveled
down
Yes,
we
have.
I
remember
it
well.
Winding,
twisting
and
Incessant
writhing.
Do
you
recall
Saint
Dominique?
La
Martinique.
I
tried
to
kill
you
in
Saint
Dominique.
Either
or.
Hardly
appropriate
for
a
first
mate.
Was
I
the
first?
I've
often
wondered.
You
can
be
so
charming
The
trick
is
finding
out
what.
The
truth,
then,
is
it?
Blackbeard
has
served
his
purpose.
You
and
I
can
go
to
where
we
shall
bathe
one
another
and
other
assorted
debaucheries.
And
I'll
tell
you
Yes.
The
profane
ritual.
Can
I
trust
you,
Jack?
-
I
need
you
on
my
side.
You
and
I
are
as

me

of
Youth.
The

of
a

The

chalices
of
Ponce
de

With
these
items...
-
Yes?
you
may
take
all
the
years
You
know
what
that
means.
We
cannot
go
alone,
you
and
I.
The
ritual
requires
a
victim.
-
That
is
unfortunate.
I
find
my
desire
for
the
Fountain
But
there
is
something
onboard
What
about
Blackbeard?
He's
in
the
chart
room.
He
keeps
each
ship
as
a
prize.
You
help
me,
Though
I
think
I
know
the
one
The
Black
Pearl
in
a
bottle?
Why
is
the
Black
Pearl
in
a
bottle?
He's
even
more
annoying
in
miniature.
-
Do
we
have
a
deal,
Jack?
You
are
not
going
to
steal
the
life
What
about
the
one-legged
man?
I
need
years,
Jack.
Not
for
me.
For
my
father.
I
am
truly
the
daughter
of
Blackbeard.
You've
fallen
for
your
own
con,
love.
No,
he
is
my
father.
The
lies
I
told
you
were
not
lies.
You
lied
to
me
by
telling
me
the
truth?
-
Yes.
-
May
I
use
that?
Of
course
I
will.
So,
will
you
not
give
up
this
quest?
I
want
a
father,
Jack.
Angelica,
your
father,
Blackbeard...
...he
is
evil,
and
he
will
kill
you
given
the
chance.
-
He
cannot
be
saved.

on

You
stole
years
of
my
life,
Jack.
And
you
are
en
route
and
I
am
not
inclined

All

out

No

Come!

Whale

Can
you

Let's
not

our

up.
The

Perfect

We're

Sharks?
There'll

from
a

Don't
be

and

as

But
when
it
comes
time
they
snatch
a

out

off
the
deck
of
a
ship,
and
then
the
sailors

Or,
sometimes,
the

around.
-
Sing.
They
like
to
hear
singing.
My

Louder.
And
3,000

My

pierced
by
Cupid
I
disdain

There
is
nothing

me.
Man,
look.
Look
there.
You'll
scare
her
off!
Aye,
and
good
riddance!
Can
you
talk?
Yes.
You're
beautiful.
-
Are
you
the
one
who
sings?
Are
you
my
jolly
sailor
bold?
-
Aye,
that
I
be.
Boys!
There
ain't
much
in
my
brief,
miserable
life,
But,
by
God,
I'll
have
it
said
that
Scrum
had
himself
a
kiss
My
heart
is
pierced

Cupid
I
disdain

ye

Whoever
you
may

Who

upon

It
has
begun!
Light
'em
up!
Muster
your
courage!
Nets
into
the
water!
Quickly!
Retreat,
all,
to
land!
Retreat,
I
say!
Cowards!
Back
in
the
water!
There
be
no
refuge
on
land!
On
my
word!
We
got
one!
I'm
in
love!
Check
the
wounded!
See
if
you
can
find
Come,
give
a
hand!
Well
done,
sailor.
Did
everyone
see
that?
Because
I
will
not
be
doing
it
again.
Back
to
the
ship.
-
Lord.
Is
that?
-
Give
up
this
madness
now.
Ever
walk
on
the
beach,
look
back
and
see
your
footsteps
It's
like
that,
-
Footstep,
actually.
We
must
hasten.
We
travel
by
foot.
-
But,
sir,
the
men.
-
They
don't
sound
dead.
Well,
I
hear
nothing
What
is
it
that
you
hear,
Mr.
Groves?
Seagulls...
nesting.
-
Nothing
more.
My
God.
Your
head
or
my
heading.
I'll
have
me
one
or
t'other,
All
hands,
forward!
-
It's
to
you
now,
Sparrow.
Best
you
not
know
the
exact
-
I
be
a
cautious
man.
What
I
want
first...
...is
Ponce
De
Len's
ship.
Why
is
it
we've
got
to
bring
her
along?
Because
tears
don't
keep.
What
is
the
ritual
again?
Water
from
the
Fountain
And
two
silver
chalices.
One
cup
with
a
tear,
one
without.
So,
one
with
a
tear
and
water
in
both?
Quite
complicated,
is
it
not?
Both
get
water.
One
gets
a
tear.
The
person
who
drinks
gets
all
the
years
of
life
How
many
years?
All
the
years
and
they
could
have
lived,
Clergyman.
On
the
off
chance
that
this
I
would
like
it
noted
here
and
now
that
I
am
fully
prepared
so
that
I
may
be
where
all
the
goody-goodies
We
have
a
word
for
that,
Jack.
I
was
thinking
more
Quartermaster!
-
Aye?
-
She
has
water.
-
Open
this.
-
You're
killing
her.
See?
Onward.
Just
as
I
thought.
Not
this
way!
This
is
the
way,
isn't
it?
'Course
it
is,
but
we
That
would
take
us
out
of
-
Well,
then
we'll
circle
back.
You're
the
one
who
insisted
-
Well,
the
mutiny
didn't
help.
-
You
would
know.
You
mean
split
up?
You
mean
jump?
Sparrow
will
go.
Sparrow?
What
makes
you
Yes,
what
makes
you
think
We
cannot
trust
him,
Father.
I'll
go.
She'll
go.
How
much
farther
to
the
Fountain?
I'm
running
out
of
time.
About
a
day's
march
north,
you'll
get
to
a
series
of
pools.
You
will
go.
I
was
sure
it
would
come
to
this.
You
know
that
feeling
you
get
sometimes
Sudden
urge
to
jump?
I
don't
have
it.
I
need
those
chalices.
Shoot.
Save
me
the
bother
of
the
fall.
You
will
go.
You
will
return...
...or
I
will
kill
her.
You
won't
kill
your
own
daughter.
Quartermaster,
get
me
six
more
pistols,
remove
the
shot
from
all
but
two,
but
do
not
tell
me
which
two.
You
get
to
choose,
Mr.
Sparrow.
No.
No.
-
Yes.
'Course
I
am.
Again.
Please,
they're
not
even
loaded.
Again.
If
you're
so
keen
on
killing
her,
-
why
don't
you
just
let
her
jump?
If
you
jump
and
die,
then
she
will
have
her
chance.
Again.
Oi...
...if
I
jump,
will
I
survive?
The
doll.
-
Yes,
now
you
will
survive.
Wet.
Wet
again.
We
go
on.
Well
played,
Father.
You
knew
which
guns
were
loaded,
right?
Of
course,
my
love.
Be
nice
to
have
a
map
about
now.
Or
a
ship.
Stop!
Hold
very
still.
Ye
dare
not
let
it
touch
your
skin.
What?
What
be
wrong
with
What
are
you
stopping
for,
eh?
Push
on!
-
Push
on!
Push
on!
Fortune
continues
to
favor
us.
The
Santiago.
Famously
captained
by
Ponce
de
Len.
There's
no
one
there.
Right,
then.
We
must
not
stop.
You
will
walk.
I
cannot.
Walk
or
die.
Put
your
arms
around
me.
-
I
do
not
ask
for
help.
-
We're
in
a
hurry,
yes?
Hold
here
'til
I
say!
Such
beauty.
Surely
you're
one
of
and
not
a
descendant
who
found
no
refuge
on
the
Ark.
Such
beauty...
...and
yet
deadly.
-
Deadly?
No.
No.
You
are
different.
Different?
Are
you
not?
You
protect.
Did
you?
You
pushed
me
down
out
of
the
way.
-
You
see
the
Fountain?
Bring
the
creature.
She
has
a
name!
Pray
tell.
She
is
Syrena.
Ponce
de
Len.
If
40
pirates
it
would
not
match
You.
-
You.
...you.
-
You,
why
are
you
here?
-
Why
are
you?
-
for
my
royal
liege.
Back,
back!
We
have
to
balance
it
out!
The
whole
ship
will
slide!
Right,
then.
What
if
we
each
choose
an
item
Put
it
back!
We
touch
nothing!
What
about
that?
The
chalices.
Oi!
Why
do
you
get
to
look
first?
Fine,
then.
-
Together.
Rocks.
The
Spanish.
They're
ahead
of
us,
mate.
I
shall
have
a
look
at
that
map.
I
wonder
why
they
left
this
behind.
Don't
touch
the
map.
They
know
the
path,
but
I
can
also
see
where
Jack!
Gibbs,
I
was
just
on
me
way
You
stole
my
map.
Right.
Best
be
started.
Ol.
Mermaids.
Careful,
these
pools
run
deep.
If
she
escapes,
all
is
lost.
Look.
Look!
Staked
out
to
die,
to
dry
in
the
sun.
Only
half
in
the
water.
but
just
enough
to
make
the
dying
slow.
Think
on
it.
Your
people,
murdered,
Syrena,
won't
you
cry?
All
die,
even
you.
-
Soon,
I
hear.
Listen.
Can
you
not
hear
your
sisters
scream?
Do
you
not
hear
them?
We
need
but
one
tear.
Vile
creature!
-
Chop
off
her
fingers,
one
by
one!
Cut
out
the
tears
Where's
your
voice
in
this?
Maybe
she'll
have
a
change
of
heart
Oh,
aye,
she
will
burn,
Perhaps
we
should
build
a
fire.
-
No.
-
You
will
not
torture
her.
I
will
tear
every
scale
If
that
displeases
you,
go
pray.
I
was
wrong.
Not
every
soul
Behold,
gentlemen,
That
vile
creature,
as
you
call
her,
Oh,
you
care
for
her?
You
fancy
her.
And
do
not
deny
what
is
Question
is...
...does
she
fancy
you?
By
God,
she
does.
We
are
in
luck!
Bring
forth
a
tear...
...or
witness
the
death
Syrena,
if
you
could
manage
a
tear,
I
would
be
grateful.
Sadness,
yes,
-
but
no
sorrow...
yet.
Time
and
tide
wait
for
none.
Aye,
mermaids
are
tough.
The
lot
of
them.
Tie
her
up
like
the
others.
-
You
are
confident?
I
am
a
woman.
So
is
she.
What's
your
play,
Jack?
There
is
a
girl...
...a
female...
of
the
opposite
sex.
-
When
is
there
not?
You're
rescuing
a
damsel?
Yes,
but
it's
just
that
-
some
manner
of
harm
many
moons
ago.
Gibbs,
this
is
the
woman
from
Seville.
Ah,
you
pretended
to
love
her,
Worse.
I
may
have
had,
...stirrings.
-
Stirrings.
No,
no,
no.
Not
quite
all
the
way
All
right,
feelings,
damn
you.
And
you
left
her
still.
Thank
you.
Stealth
over
force.
I'll
take
it
from
here
You
don't
have
termites,
do
you?
I
appreciate
your
concern,
Jack,
but
I'll
be
keeping
Hold
here,
Lieutenant
Commander.
There.
That
one.
Make
note
of
his
tent
No,
wait.
By
God,
Your
sword
smells
funny.
Aye.
Poison
from
the
Just
a
scratch,
Would
you
mind
pointing
it
I
don't
like
toads.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
Isn't
that
how
you
do
it?
Or
sometimes
I
just...
improvise.
Now
what?
We
stroll
out,
slow
and
steady.
Just
like
we
belong.
-
I'm
sorry,
Syrena.
-
Yes.
Why?
You're
different,
are
you
not?
Do
you
know
not
of
kindness?
Tears
of
sorrow,
never.
Mermaids
be
too
tough
for
that.
But
tears
of
joy...
They
say
these
be
Syrena,
on
my
word,
Let
her
go.
Let
her
go?
No.
Secure
her
bonds.
How's
that
escape
route
working?
Here's
your
chance
to
improvise.
I'm
attempting
it.
I
might
be
able
to
get
a
hand
loose.
Oh,
you
got
a
knife.
Better.
I
want
one
of
those.
Here's
to
revenge.
Sweet
and
clear.
-
Revenge?
If
you
wanted
the
chalices,
you'd
seen
they
were
missing
and
gone.
You
were
lying
in
wait,
for
Blackbeard.
King
George.
Privateer.
Wig.
Cheap
theatrical
facade.
-
I'm
not
buying
it.
-
When
the
Pearl
was
lost?
We
were
off
the
coast
of
Hispaniola
No
provocation
nor
warning
We
were
peppered
with
cannon
fire.
And
then
the
sea
beneath
The
Pearl
was
pitching
Every
plank,
every
rail,
every
spar,
all
at
once,
The
rigging
had
come
to
life.
Our
own
ship
turned
against
us...
...tangling
the
crew,
And
wrapping
around
me
leg.
But
me
arms
were
free
I
am
the
master
of
me
ship,
I
am
the
master
of
my
fate,
So
I
did
what
needed
done.
I
survived.
So...
you're
not
after
the
Fountain.
I
care
not
for
King
George
that
give
hope
for
a
healed
limb.
But
I'd
give
my
left
arm
-
Not
your
right?
to
drive
my
poisoned
blade
I'll
see
you
get
the
chance,
mate.
The
prisoner's
escaping.
He's
escaping!
Go!
Go!
Hold
your
fire!
I
want
him
alive!
I
figured
that
was
the
signal.
-
Go!
Prepare
to
move
out!
I'm
sorry
about
the
chalices,
Jack,
-
I'll
not
be
going
back.
-
Shall
we
have
a
drink?
How
is
it
we
can
never
meet
You
brought
the
chalices,
Sparrow?
Aye.
Oi!
-
I
see
you
brought
a
friend.
And
the
one-legged
man,
he
is
near.
Aye.
Now...
Before
I
go
just
handing
them
over,
-
Name
them.
I'll
be
having
me
compass
back.
Firstly,
upon
your
word,
you
will
bring
no
harm
to
Angelica.
I'll
make
no
vows
But
it
costs
me
nothing
to
admit
that
she
was
never
in
harm's
way.
Secondly
then,
priorly
firstly,
I
will
be
having
me
compass
back.
Please?
I
do
deserve
it.
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
difficult
Not
the
big
one,
Thank
you.
And
thirdly,
Mr.
Beard,
there
are
times,
not
very
often,
when
I
do
reflect
Chief
among
them,
I
note
how
poorly
-
my
loyal
first
mate.
Left
him
to
rot
in
jail,
I
did.
Still
don't.
But,
point
being,
-
Is
that
it?
Quick,
or
the
pig
runs,
Jack,
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you,
Done.
Release
the
swine.
Perhaps,
if
you
don't
mind,
This
will
lead
you
to
freedom,
mate.
I
could
have
swore
it
was
We
must
not
stop.
Dead
end.
Dead.
End.
Dead
end.
Jack,
I'm
starting
to
think
It
is
not
the
destination
Chalices,
if
you
please.
Stand
back.
Jack...
...have
you
ever,
in
fact...
...seen
with
your
own
eyes...
I'm
sorry,
could
you
Quartermaster.
No,
no!
Wait,
wait!
Wait.
"Aqua...
de
Vida."
Master
Scrum...
...do
you
mind?
So
beautiful.
Sparrow,
I'll
be
the
first
Father.
The
one-legged
man.
-
You
brought
him
here.
Edward
Teach!
For
crimes
committed
on
the
high
seas,
by
the
authority
granted
me
...and
with
a
goodly
amount
...I
hereby
place
you
and
declare
you
to
be
my
prisoner.
My
trick's
out,
is
that
it?
Such
crimes
do
include,
but
are
not
murder,
torture
of
including
the
brutal
theft
of
one
used,
You...
dare
face
this
sword?
This
far
away
from
your
ship?
Aye.
Aye.
That
be
the
cold
breath
But
I'll
have
one
last
fight,
by
God.
Kill
'em
all!
Hang
on
a
minute.
I
just...
I
just
need
Right,
so,
you
will
fight
against
them,
they
will
fight
against
you.
All
on
account
of
him
Where
is
the
sense?
Exactly.
I
say,
let
them
fight
watch,
have
a
drink,
Aye.
-
Kill
'em!
Get
off
me!
Scrum,
the
chalices!
And
the
tear!
Follow!
Fight!
Hand
it
over.
The
tear.
I'm
more
afraid
of
her
Hand
it
over.
-
The
chalices,
if
you
please.
I
told
you,
I
need
years.
Scrum!
Syrena...
Oh
God,
you
will
not
take
her.
If
you
have
taken
her,
Give
her
back...
Give
her
back,
please.
Please.
I
expected
fate
I
will
not
have
that
smile
Take
a
gander,
Edward
Teach.
This
land
is
hereby
forever
of
His
Majesty
King
George...
Someone
make
a
note
Seorita,
the
chalices,
por
favor.
Only
God
can
grant
eternal
life,
Men,
destroy
this
profane
temple!
The
Fountain!
You
are
a
fool.
You
seek
in
this
place
Faith?
In
faith,
but
darkness
enough
to
blind.
What
devilry
is
this?
-
For
the
Pearl.
Angelica!
Don't!
It's
poison!
I'm
not
such
the
fool
without
a
little
venomous
advantage.
Jack!
I
claim
Blackbeard's
ship
and
crew,
and
this
sword,
Hang
on!
Pull!
Do
not
waste
my
tear.
Drink
this.
-
You
must
drink
the
other.
I
cannot
save
you
both.
You
take
it,
Father,
for
your
soul.
Captain
Teach,
she's
dying.
This
one
takes
life?
This
one
has
the
tear
and
gives
life?
Aye,
hurry!
Angelica...
No.
I
love
you,
Father.
Wait
a
minute.
In
fact,
it
might
have
been
This
cup
had
the
tear,
Trickster!
-
Devil!
You
bastard!
How
could
you?
Your
father
saved
you.
Perhaps
his
soul
is
now
redeemed,
eh?
You
are
hurt.
In
body
only.
My
mind
is
at
peace...
-
Me?
I
was
lost.
The
wind,
the
tides...
...they
ought
to
renew
a
man's
faith.
But
for
me,
only
you.
Philip,
I
can
save
you.
You
need
only
ask.
-
I
seek
but
one
thing.
Forgiveness.
If
not
for
me,
you
would
Ask.
Forgive
me?
I
hate
you.
The
bloke
who
saved
your
life?
The
years
I
possess,
I
only
helped
Blackbeard
do
what
You
are
cruel
and
ignorant.
One
pistol,
one
shot.
To
kill
myself
before
I
starve?
There's
no
trusting
you,
love.
Besides,
this
is
a
You
can
signal
a
passing
ship.
Or
you
can
just
bite
the
And
how
will
I
get
free
You
broke
free
of
your
bonds
waiting
for
the
precise
moment
Admit
it,
Jack.
-
You
still
love
me.
I'd
choose
the
dog.
Treasure!
Jewels
with
the
power
-
You're
making
that
up!
I
am
with
child.
Yours.
I
don't
recall
that
we
ever
had...
-
You
were
drunk!
Wait!
There
is
something
I
want
to
say
to
you.
Something
I
wanted
to
say
Go
on,
then.
I
love
you.
As
do
I.
Always
have.
Always
will.
I
gotta
go.
Jack!
This
is
not
over!
Jack!
Missed!
The
Revenge
is
mine.
Sir...
We
found
this
below
decks.
All
hands!
Get
cracking,
The
Crown
served
me
well.
But
now,
by
the
gods
of
sea
and
sky...
...make
way
for
Tortuga!
Gibbs,
you
filthy,
besotted
shellback,
Aye!
And
I
trust
we
managed
a
profit
-
from
our
joint
enterprise?
The
compass
led
me
straight
and
true.
What
of
Blackbeard's
men
I
employed
the
selfsame
maneuver
Seemed
a
shame
to
leave
Shame
indeed.
I
hate
that
monkey.
So,
the
Pearl...
We
shall
need
a
crossbow,
One
of
us
must
learn
to
play
the
trumpet
-
I
know
a
man
with
a
goat.
Jack,
I
have
to
ask...
You
had
the
chalices,
You
could
have
lived
maybe
forever.
The
Fountain
does
test
you,
Gibbs.
But
better
to
not
know
Every
morsel
of
your
entire
being
alive
to
the
infinite
mystery
of
it
all.
And
who's
to
say
Discoverer
of
the
Fountain
of
Youth.
I
have
no
say
in
it,
Gibbs.
It's
a
pirate's
life
for
me.
Savvy?
