And
so,

I

pressing
my

And
somewhere,
I
was
so
spent,
And
so,
Richard

He
stretched
his
legs
At
the
edge
of
the
jungle,
I
was

That
he

But
he
just
stared
ahead
And
then,
Richard
Parker,
the
terrible
one
disappeared
After
a

He
left
and

I
wept
like
a

Not

I
was
overwhelmed
I
was
weeping
It
broke
my
heart.
You

Richard
Parker

But
I

Even

You

My

I

I
don't

It's
hard
to
believe,
It
is
a
lot
to
take
in.
To
figure
out
If
it

Why

Some

Are
you

about
that?
Of

they
do.
In
