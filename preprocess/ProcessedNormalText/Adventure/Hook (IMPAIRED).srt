Tink,
you
came
and
you
saved
me.
You
brought
me
to
Never

But
I
was
still
a
little

So
I
decided
to
fly
home
But
it
was

with
you.
I'm

Peter.
Ever
so
much
more
than

at
that

give
her
a
kiss.
No.
No,

I
couldn't
bear
when
she
finds
No.
I
mean
a
real
kiss.

I
can
see
why

So

sad
memories,
Peter.

Peter,
you're

Hi,

I
know
why
I
came
back.
I
wanted
to
be
