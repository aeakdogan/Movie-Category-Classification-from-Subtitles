Hey,
this
area's
restricted.
Oh,
hi.
Yeah,
I
know.
Some
of
this
wiring
got
screwed
up.
Nobody
called
it
down
to
me.
I'm
going
to
have
to
see
a
work
order.
Yeah.
Just
a
second.
There
you
are.
Nothing
personal.
I
guess
that
wraps
it
up.
Marty,
I
couldn't
be
happier
Congratulations.

Hold
that.
Whoa!
Ahem!
Gee,
thanks.
Thanks
for
pushing
that,
Bob.
The
light's
on,
but
you
never
know,
Shut
up.
Remember,
honey...

Ooh!
Jesus.
Bob,
what
button
did
you
push?


All
responding
Mr
Bagwell,
..remain
locked
down
and
empty.
Yes,
sir.
There's
no
other
way...
no
doors...
..except
through
access
panels,
Yes,
sir.
Gentlemen,
what
we
have
here
..below
floor
30.
The
bomb's
already
taken
out
cables.
The
bomber
wants
$3
million
What's
our
clock?
He
gave
one
hour.
That
leaves
us
23
minutes
exactly.
Anything
else
The
basement.
The
city
would
like
to
avoid
that
event,
We
can't
just
unload
the
passengers?
This
is
an
express
elevator.
The
only
way
in
or
out
The
bomber's
also
wired
...which
seats
him
Sir,
Harry
volunteers
to
examine
the
device.
Yeah,
right.
Fine.
The
two
of
you
check
it
out.
The
nearest
access
panel's
I
want
reports
only.
Worthy,
Briggs,
No-one
in
or
out.
Everyone
else,
Looks
like
we're
walking.
Hurry,
folks,
but
watch
your
step!

Come

Get
us
out
of

Hello!
Please,
help
us!
Come
on,
man!


Help!
Please,
get
us
out
of
here!
Please!
Please!
Get
us
out
of
here!
Who's
up
there?
Who's
up
there?
What's
going
on?
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
is
the
LAPD.
-
Thank
God.

There's
been
Hey,
come
on!
We'll
have
you
out
of
there
Am
I
lying?
How
come
they
sent
cops
here?
Shouldn't
they
send
repair
guys?
-
Yeah.
What
do
you
think?
You're
the
expert.
I
just
work
here.
Looks
pretty
solid.
Anyone
we
know?
I
don't
recognise
the
work,
but
he's
a
pro.
He's
cutting
it
close.
I
don't
like
it.
Well,
what's
to
like?
Mac
said
we
hold,
so
we
hold.
All
right.
Pop
quiz.
The
airport.
Gunman
with
one
hostage.
He's
using
her
for
cover.
You're
100
feet
away.
Jack.
Shoot
the
hostage.
What?
Take
her
out
of
the
equation.
Go
for
the
good
wound.
Clear
shot.
You're
deeply
nuts.
You
know
that?
"Shoot
the
hostage."

Harry,
this
is
wrong.
He's
going
to
blow
it
anyway.
Why?
I
don't
know.
Gut
feeling.
Right
now,
Mac
outranks
your
gut,
so
we
sit.
This
is
taking
way
too
long.
How
much
you
think
that
elevator
weights?
Jack,
come
on.
Maybe
we
can
do
something
We're
not
going
to
shoot
them,
right?
Hey,
where
you
going?
What's
going
on?
Don't
go!
Don't
leave
us
here!
No,
we
just
take
them
out
of
the
equation.
Are
you
sure
it'll
hold?
It'll
hold.
Six
minutes.
I
can't
get
any
more
time.
He's
not
talking!
I
need
the
goddamn
money
now.
Tell
me
again,
Harry.
Why
did
I
take
this
job?
Aw,
come
on.
30
more
years
of
this,...
..you
get
a
tiny
pension
Cool.
Ho.
God,
it's
hot
in
here.
There's
no
air.
Can't
they
just
pry
the
doors
open?
I
can't
breathe.
Don't
fuck
with
daddy.

Grab
her
hand!
Grab
her
hand!
Usually
they
fall
down
now.
Oh,
my
God!
Get
her
out
of
there!
He's
early!
Son
of
a
bitch
is
early!
Mac,
we
need
more
help
up
here
now!
Oh,
please!
I
don't
want
to
die!
Please
save
us!
Open
the
door!
Open
the
doors!
Help!
Please
help
me!
Get
me
out!
We'll
get
you
out!
Come
on.
Give
me
your
hands!
It's
OK,
give
me
your
hands.
Watch
your
head.
OK,
I've
got
you.
Take
it
easy.
-
Oh,
thank
you.
-
You're
fine.
Take
her.
Let's
go.
Who's
next?
Thank
you.
We've
got
you,
ma'am.
What
the
hell
is
all
this?
Help
us!
Hurry!
Hurry,
hurry!
Let's
go!
Go!
Go!
Let's
go!
Come
on.
Come
on.
Oh,
my
God!
Help
me
out!
Please,
help
me
out.
Come
on,
lady!
Come
on!
No.
No.
Come
on,
lady!
Come
on!
Grab
my
hand!
Come
on!
Let's
go!
It's
going
to
fall!
No!
I
can't!
Just
take
one
step,
reach
out,
Come
on!
Come
on!
Oh!
Oh,
God!
Don't
let
go
of
me.
You're
OK.

My...
my
shoe!
Let's
go!
Let's
go!
Was
it
good
for
you?
It
was
great
for
me.
Elevator
dropped.
Oh,
good.
That's
good
to
know.

Is
your
watch
slow?
Uh-uh.
He
jumped
the
gun.
Why
does
he
do
that?
He's
losing
his
$3
million.
I
don't
know.
Maybe
he
couldn't
It's
a
common
problem
So
I'm
told.
He's
here.
He
could've
blown
that
thing
from
Pacoima.
No.
He
knew
we
were
up
to
something.
He's
close
by.
He's
not
going
to
corner
...we
evacuated
anyway.
Come
on.
He'd
want
to
be
here,
Right?
The
elevators.
Passenger
cars
were
stopped.
What
about
the
freight
elevators?

Will
the
mystery
guest
please
sign
in?
What?
Jack!
Damn
it.

Get
to
the
side!

Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Up!
Get
your
ass
up!

I
don't
suppose
anybody
..just
for
you.

Hold
it!
Pop
quiz,
hotshot.
Terrorist
holding
a
police
hostage.
Got
enough
dynamite
..to
blow
a
building
in
half.
There's
gonna
be
50
cops
Standard
flanking
deployment,
right?
Maybe
we'll
get
off
on
the
third
floor,
huh?
At
least
that's
what
they'll
think.
I
want
a
location
on
those
goddamn
shots!
Briggs!
Where's
Jack
and
Harry?
Lieutenant,
we've
got
movement...
..on
the
freight
elevator.
It's
on
three.
Let's
move!

End
of
the
line.
This
day
has
been
real
disappointing,
Why?
There'll
come
a
time,
boy,
Mister,
I'm
already
there.
You
can
see
I'm
in
charge
here.
I
drop
this
stick...
...and
they
pick
your
friend
up
Are
you
ready
to
die,
friend?
Fuck
you.
In
200
years,
we've
come
from...
..."I
regret
but
I
have
one
life
to
give
...to
"fuck
you"?
Go
ahead.
Drop
the
stick.
Do
it.
Shut
up,
Harry.
We've
got
all
the
balls
Give
it
up.
You
got
nowhere
to
go!
Shoot
the
hostage.
Say
goodbye,
Harry.

You
fuck!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Give
it
up!
You're
out
of
options!

Through
dedication
and
bravery,...
..these
next
two
officers
..of
13
citizens
of
this
city.
And
thanks
to
them,..
..the
only
life
taken
You
shot
me.
I
can't
believe
it.
They're
giving
you
a
medal
Harry,
you
told
me
to.
The
highest
honour
bestowed...
..upon
a
member
Officer
Harry
Temple.
Congratulations.
Thank
you.
Officer
Jack
Traven.


Way
to
go,
Jack.
Way
to
go.
Here
we
go.
There
you
are,
my
man.
Beautiful.
A
toast
to
me.
Make
me
feel
good
about
myself.
Hey,
Sandy!
Here
we
go!
OK,
so
how
we
do...
oh!
Whoa,
whoa.
Shit.
I
need
a
bib!
Here
we
go.
All
right!
Can't
take
me
anywhere.
Thank
you.
That's
mine.
And
here
is
to
Harry...
...for
his
quick
thinking,...

..for
his
grace
under
pressure...
..and
for
his
brave
and
selfless
act.
Hear!
Hear!
Hear!
Hear!
And
to
Jack,
for
shooting
Harry.
Oh,
no!
Something
we've
all
wanted
to
do...
...for
a
very
long
time.
Hey,
hey!
OK,
no,
no.
Here
it
is.
Here's
to
you
guys
for
doing
your
job...
...and
for
not
getting
dead.
Mazel
tov.
Mazel
tov.
I
can't
do
that.
We're
the
two
luckiest
guys
in
the
world,
We
got
the
bad
guy
We're
good.
No!
You
were
lucky.
No,
we
were
lucky.
You
better
understand
it.
We
were
dealing
with
a
total
psycho.
This
guy
could've
blown
us
up
at
any
time.
Phew!
And
I
got
a
bullet
in
me.
6
inches
off
the
mark,
...to
my
wife.
Harry,
come
on,
man.
I
mean,
we
won.
We
got
him.
Do
you
listen?
Do
you
ever...
...to
back
you
up,
Guts'll
get
you
so
far...
...and
then
they'll
get
you
killed.
Luck
runs
out
sooner
or
later.
Right,
Chief?
That's
right.
Ho!
I'm
all
right.
I'm
all
right.
I'm
going
to
go
home,
have
some
sex.
Harry,
you're
going
to
go
home...
...and
puke.
Yeah,
well,
that'll
be
fun,
too.
Come
on,
you
gimp.
Hey,
Jack,
saw
you
on
TV.
Congratulations.
Thanks,
Bob.
Yeah.
You
looked
fat.
Take
it
easy
on
him,
Bob.
The
boy
was
up
late
last
night
partying.
Wild
party?
I
don't
remember
that
well.
Couldn't
have
been
too
great.
Yeah?
The
last
time
I
partied
like
that,...
...I
woke
up
married.
Huh,
Vinnie?
Hey,
Jack,
you
forgot
your
muffins.
Have
a
good
one,
Bob!
Thanks,
Jack!
Take
care,
huh?
Thanks.
See
you
tomorrow!



What
do
you
think,
Jack?
You
think
if
you
pick
up
...they'll
give
you
another
medal?
Jesus!
You
think
I
wouldn't
have
been
prepared?
Two
years
I
spent
Two
years
I
invested
myself
in
it.
You
couldn't
understand
You
ruined
a
man's
life's
work
...you
can
walk
away?
You
got
blinders
on
to
the
world,...
...but
I
got
your
attention
now,
didn't
I,
Jack?
Why
didn't
you
just
come
after
me?
This
is
about
me!
About
my
money!
This
is
about
money
due
me,
$3.7
million.
It's
mynest
egg,
Jack.
At
my
age,
you've
got
to
think
ahead.
When
I
find
you...
Pop
quiz,
hotshot.
There's
a
bomb
on
a
bus.
Once
the
bus
goes
50
miles
an
hour,
If
it
drops
below
50,
it
blows
up.
What
do
you
do?
What
do
you
do?
I'd
want
to
know
what
bus
it
was.
You
think
I'm
going
to
tell
you
that?
Yes.
Very
good.
There
are
rules,
Jack,
No-one
goes
off
the
bus.
You
try
to
take
any
passengers
off
the
bus,
I
want
my
money...
..by
11
am.
We
can't
pull
that
kind
of
money
in
time.
Focus,
Jack!
Your
concern
is
the
bus.
And
don't
try
to
call.
The
radio's
down.
Now,
the
number
of
the
bus
is
2525.
It's
running
downtown
from
Venice.
It
is
at
the
corner
of...
..Ocean
Park...
..and
Main.
Sam!
Sam!
Annie.
Sam!
Tell
him
to
stop!
Shit.
Excuse
me.
Coming
through!
Sam!
Wait!
Sam!
This
ain't
no
bus
stop.
Get
rid
of
your
butt.
OK,
it's
gone.
It's
gone.
You
are
a
good,
kind
man.
One
day,
people
will
write
songs
about
you.
Hi.
Hi.
First
time
in
LA.
Oh,
no.
I
live
here.
No,
I
mean
mine.
You
heard
me
wrong.
I'm
sightseeing.
...but
it's
not
like
I
can
hide
it.
Not
really.
Aw,
jeez.
...just
to
get
here
from
the
airport.
I
got
so
lost.
LA
is
one
large
place.
Course,
you
live
here.
I'm
such
a
yokel.
There.
I
said
it.
You
know
what?
I
got
gum
on
my
seat.
Gum.
Excuse
me.
Good
morning.
Hi.


Hey!
Watch
it!

I
just
couldn't
handle
the
freeways
any
more.
I
got
so
tense.
This
way,
Yeah,
well,
I
love
my
car.
I
miss
my
car.
Oh,
God.
Look
at
that.
Hey,
Sam!
Shit.
-
Sam!
Why
don't
you
just
drive
over
Don't
spit
on
my
bus,
Annie.
Such
a
mess.
Stop!
Open
up!
Get
off
the
door.
This
ain't
no
bus
stop.
He
really
wants
on
the
bus.
Open
up!
Stop!
Don't,
Sam!
Don't
let
him
on!
LAPD!
I
can't
hear
you!
Stop
this
bus!
What?
LAPD!
Stop
the
bus!
LAPD!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
LAPD!
Get
out
of
the
car.
This
is
my
car.
I
own
this
car.
It's
not
stolen.
It
is
now.
Move
over.
Fuck!
Man,
you
scratch
this
puppy...
..and
me
and
you
are
gonna
have
words.
You
understand?
OK,
look,
man,
Just
slow
down
a
little
bit.
Holy
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Come
on,
man.
Just
don't
tear
up
my
car,
all
right?
OK,
OK.
Just
slow
down
just
a
bit,
all
right?
We
don't
have
to
go
so
fast,
do
we?
We
don't
have
to
go
so...
That
was
a
nice
move,
man.
Whoo!
Shit,
shit,
shit,
shit.
The
least
you
can
do
is
slow
down.
Come
on.
Oh,
shit.
Slow!
Shit!

Move!
Move!
Is
that
that
guy?
Man
sure
has
a
hard-on
for
this
bus.


Hey,
buddy...
Hey!
I'm
a
cop!
What?
I'm
a
cop!
LAPD!
There's
a
bomb
on
your
bus!
-
What?
There's
a...
What?
Fuck!
There's
a
bomb
on
your
bus!
Watch
the
road!
Grab
that.
I
want
you
to
write
on
the
back:
Write
it,
write
it,
write
it!
Watch
the
road.
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit!
No!
Don't
slow
down!

No!
No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Speed
up!
Op...
Open
your
door!
Open
the
doors!
50!
Stay
above
50!
-
OK.
470-8000.
Harry.
Harry,
it's
Jack.
All
right.
Yep.
You
better
not
be
calling
in
sick,
Harry,
he's
alive.
What?
The
bomber.
He's
back.
He
hit
one
in
Venice
already.
Temple!
We
just
got
a
ransom
demand
Says
he's
rigged
a
city
bus.
Where
do
you
think?
I
gotta
get
on
that
bus.
You
gotta
get
on...
Drive
straight!
Stay
in
this
lane!
Watch
the
road.
Wait
a
minute.
What
are
you
doing?
Are
you
insured?
Yeah!
Why?

No!
No!
You
broke
my...
my
door.
Sir,
I
need
to
take
your
phone.
Take
the
phone.
Take
the
wheel.
What
are
you...
What?
Oh,
oh,
shit.
Whoa,
shit.
Drive
straight.
Oh,
shit.
Whoa,
shit.
Whoa,
shit!
Whoa!
Shit!
This
guy's
out
of
his
mind.
OK,
listen,
you've
got
to
stay
above
50.
Excuse
me,
are
you
out
of
your
mind?
Whatever
it
takes.
Hello?
Everybody,
I'm
Jack
Traven,
LAPD.
We
have
a
slight
situation
on
the
bus
here.
Ma'am,
if
you'll
please
sit
down.
You're
scaring
the
shit
out
of
these
people.
Ma'am,
please!
If
everybody
will
stay
in
your
seats...
..and
remain
calm,...
..we
should
be
able
to
defuse
the
problem,...
..so
sit
tight...
Get
away
from
me!
I
don't
know
you,
man.
Let's
not
do
this.
-
Stop
the
bus!
Stop
the
bus!
Stop
it!
Listen!
Look,
I'm
putting
my
gun
away,
OK?
OK?
Now,
listen.
I
don't
care
about
your
crime.
Whatever
you
did,...
...I'm
sure
that
you're
sorry,
It's
over.
I'm
not
a
cop
right
now.
See?
We're
just
two
cool
guys,

Sam!
I'll
get
the
wheel!
I've
got
it!
Sam!
Oh
God,
Sam!


Come
on.
Somebody
move
his
legs!
Hold
on!
Sam,
get
your
foot...
I
got
to
stop
this
thing!
No!
Don't!
Stay
above
50!
Sam's
been
shot!
You
slow
down
and
this
bus
will
explode!
There
is
a
bomb
on
this
bus.
If
we
slow
down,
it'll
blow.
If
anyone
tries
to
get
off,
it'll
explode.
Bullshit!
Yeah,
there's
a
bomb.
Some
funny
joke,
man.
Are
we
gonna
have
a
problem
now?
He's
bleeding
so
much.
Put
pressure
front
and
back
Hold
on.
Sam,
lift
your
head.
Miss,
can
you
handle
this
bus?
Oh,
sure.
I
need
to
know!
Can
you
handle
it?
I'm
fine.
I'm
fine.
Is
there
a
plan?
Just
for
you
to
drive.
We're
OK
for
now.
Good
plan.
So,
you're
a
cop,
right?
That's
right.
I
should
probably
tell
you
...because
I
had
my
driver's
licence
revoked.
What
for?
Speeding.
Harry,
we're
on
our
way
to
the
chopper.
If
anything
changes,
let
us
know!
Anything
we
haven't
seen
...something
wrong
with
the
driver,...
...but
at
least
one
car,
a
Jaguar,...
...has
been
driven
off
the
road
The
bus
apparently
came
onto
the
freeway...
...at
the
Lincoln
on-ramp.
It
began
picking
up
speed,
swerving,...
...and
hasn't
slowed
down
since.
Minutes
ago...
...a
Los
Angeles
police
officer
...by
jumping
onto
it
from
a
moving
car.
Would
that
be
you,
Jack?

Where
do
we
start?
Check
the
speedometer.
Has
it
been
fucked
with
or
loosened?
See
any
wires
or
anything?
Excuse
me,
ma'am.
No,
it's
clean.
Then
it's
gonna
be
under
the
bus.
Probably
was
rigged
to
one
of
the
axles.
I
can't
get
under
the
bus
right
now.
Excuse
me!
Excuse
me!
Hold
on.
Yes?
Access
panel...
in
the
floor.
Underneath
you,
man.
All
right,
Harry.
Sir,
take
this.
OK,...
...we
got
a
wad!
Pretty
big!
There's
a
pretty
big
wad.
Brass
fittings!
Brass
fittings.
I
think
I
can
reach
the
circuit
wire.
He
can
reach
the
circuit
wire.
No,
no.
Don't
do
that.
That's
your
classic
decoy.
What
else?
What
else?
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
Fuck
me!
Oh,
darn.
Harry,
there's
enough
C-4
on
this
thing...
...to
put
a
hole
in
the
world.
OK,
all
right.
Just
stay
calm.
What
else?
Three
triggers...
...a
cellular
remote
and
a
timer...
...running
off
a
wrist
watch.
A
watch?
What
kind
of
watch?
Gold.
Gold
band.
Fairly
cheesy.
Officer!
-
Officer!
Shit.
What
do
I
do?
OFFICER!
What
do
I
do?
Which
way?
Oh,
shit.
Get
on
the
shoulder.
OK.
Watch
it!
Um,
stay
on
or
get
off?
Stay
on
or
get
off?
-
Off!
Off!
Hold
on!

Oh,
God.
-
Keep
going.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Oh,
God!

This
is
much
better.
..city
streets.
The
bus
is
on
Western...
..heading
in
a
southbound
direction.
Now,
where
the
bus
did
exit
here,...
..it
had
a
couple
of
close
calls.
Yeah!
Yeah!
All
right!
We
don't
know
I
don't
get
it.
The
watch
is
a
shitty
timer.
Why
use
it?
What's
he
saying?
Lots
of
people
have
watches,
Harry.
This
guy
has
no
MO.
A
bomber
falls
in
love
...and
they're
very
monogamous.
This
guy
uses
C-4,
dynamite,...
...different
trigger
every
time,...
...and
now
he
throws
in
this
watch.
He's
an
encyclopaedia
of
bombs.
He
knows
every
kind.
Yeah,
and
everything
we
do
to
dismantle
it.
Wait
a
minute.
I
want
to
look
at
the
files
We
did
the
mug
shots.
No.
I
want
to
look
at
cops.
Come
on.
Let's
go.

Yeah.
Mac,
where
have
you
been?
I
had
to
bail
on
the
freeway.
We're
in
the
city.
I
can
see
you.
Just
keep
going
straight.
I'm
going
to
try
to
clear
the
roads
for
you.
Just
stay
on-line.
Shit!
Oh,
Jesus!
God!
No!
Go
left!
Sorry!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
jeez!
People,
stay
out
of
my
way!
Stay
out
of
my
way!
Ma'am,
up
to
the
right.
OK,
OK
I
see
it.
Sh...
Mac!
Mac!
Oh,
yeah.
All
right?
A
few
more
blocks,...
...you'll
come
up
to
a
soft
turn.
Right.
Then
hold
straight.
I've
got
some
units
waiting
for
you
there.
They're
gonna
lead
you
to
the
105
Freeway.
It's
not
in
use.
It'll
be
empty.
You'll
be
totally
clear.
Got
it.
In
a
few
blocks,
OK,
wait
a
minute.
Escort
to
where?
Where
do
we
get
an
escort
to?
Watch
out!
Oh,
God!
Son
of
a
bitch!
Oh,
Jesus!
Oh,
God!
I
hit
the
baby!

Oh,
God!
I
just
hit
the
baby!
Cans!
There
was
no
baby.
It
was
full
of
cans.
-
Are
you
sure?
OK,
let's
go.
Jeez!
No!
No!
No!
Get
back!
Why
aren't
they
in
school?
Mac,
we're
boned.
I'll
get
you
out,
Jack.
All
right,
listen.
You
got
an
entrance
coming
up,
Jack.
It's
gonna
be
a
real
ugly
turn,
though.
How
ugly?
What's
ugly?
We
got
a
hard
right
coming
up...
..at
the
construction
site.
This
should
be
it.
That's
a
dead
end.
I
can't
make
that
turn.
You
can
make
it.
Keep
left.
Keep
left
and
make
it
wide.
Oh,
God.
We're
going
to
tip
over.
You're
right.
We're
going
to
tip
over.
Everyone
on
this
side
ofthe
bus
now!
On
this
side
ofthe
bus!
Hold
on!
Over
here!
Over
here!
Mac,
you
better
clear
this
site
out.
Everybody
hold
on!
This
side
of
the
bus!
Hold
on!
Hold
on!
Oh,
God!
Here
we
go!
Here
we
go!
Here
we
go!
Whoo!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
God!
ls
everybody
all
right?
-
Yes!
Take
me
to
that
interchange
at
the
105.
Oh,
my
God.
We
might've
died.
I
can't
think.
It's
OK.
if
you
need
to,
Hold
it
right
there!
Hurry
up!
Frank,...
...get
rid
of
that
scaffolding
OK.
Norwood,
I
want
aerial
units
up
ahead.
No
obstructions
in
the
freeway.
We
have
a
window
here.
Shoot.
Could
you
do
me
a
favour...
...and
hold
the
wheel
for
me
for
a
second?
Hold
the
wheel?
Thank
you.
Ma'am,
you
did
very
well.
Actually,
you
were
incredible.
Annie.
What?
It's
my
name.
Annie.
Annie.
As
opposed
to
ma'am.
OK.
So,...
..why
is
all
this
happening?
I
mean,
what
did
we
do?
Bomb
the
guy's
country
or
something?
No.
It's
just
a
guy
who
wants
money.
I
don't
buy
that.
It's
not
a
very
good
way
to
make
money.
So,
um...
..what
is
this
guy's
deal?
A
while
back,
It
went
sour,
What
does
that
have
to
do
with
us?
Nothing.
It's
a
game.
If
he
gets
the
money,
he
wins.
What
if
you
win?
Then
tomorrow
we'll
play
another
one.
But
I'm
not
available
to
drive
tomorrow.
We
got
no
match
for
that
description.
No-one's
lost
a
thumb
-
He
could
be
from
anywhere.
Forget
the
files.
I
want
you
to
start
This
guy's
drawing
disability.
He
may
not
be
LAPD,
I
want
pictures!
I've
seen
this
asshole.

Hey!
Hey,
Mac!
Let's
get
these
passengers
off
the
bus!
We
can't
do
it,
sir!
There's
no
time
for
any
stunts,
Traven.
We
got
to
get
these
people
I
got
orders!
Remember,...
..crazy,
not
stupid!
Harry's
trying
to
find
out
who
this
guy
is.
We
think
maybe
he's
a
cop.
Lieutenant,...
..it's
him!
He
wants
to
talk
to
Jack!
He's
on
the
line
for
you.
OK,
give
him
the
number.
Give
him
the
number!
How's
he
doing?
The
bleeding
is
less,
but...
Are
they
going
to
help
us?
Sure
they
are.
They're
the
police.
Your
taxes
are
paying
their
salary.
If
we
die,
they
got
to
take
a
pay
cut.

I
mean,
you
know.

Yeah.
I
think
we
have
trust...
..but
it
looks
on
TV
like
you're
trying
Look,
you've
got
to
let
me
have
one.
We
went
over
the
rules.
As
an
act
offaith.
We
have
an
injured
man
here.
The
driver's
been
shot.
Jack,
tell
me
that
you
haven't
I
thought
it
was
customary
This
man
has
no
time.
No-one
gets
off.
It'll
grease
the
wheels
with
the
money
men
There's
still
gonna
be
plenty
of
us
to
kill.
OK,
son,...
..you
can
try
and
unload
the
driver.
You
tell
that
wildcat
behind
the
wheel...
..not
to
slow
down,
though,...
..or
he
won't
even
And,
Jack,...
..don't
slip.
He's
letting
us
unload
the
driver.
Norwood!
Get
us
closer!
We're
going
to
get
the
driver
off.
Just
him?
For
now.
Gigantor!
Ortiz.
Ortiz,...
..we're
going
to
need
your
help.
I
need
you
to
pass
him
to
me.
Keep
him
straight,
What
about
the
rest
of
us?
Hey,
hey,
hey,
lady!
I've
got
you.
I
can't
stay!
I
can't
stay.
How
are
you
feeling?
Like
I've
been
shot.
Take
care,
Sam.
OK,
Annie.
Drive
straight!
Keep
it
straight!
OK,
Annie,
get
as
close
as
you
can.
OK?
All
right.
Closer!
A
little
closer,
Annie!
Annie,
a
little
closer!
OK.
OK,
how's
this?
Sorry.
Sorry.
OK,
Annie.
No
problem.
Let's
try
it
one
more
time.
A
little
more!
OK!
OK!
Right
there!
Steady!
Hold
it
steady!
I
got
him!
I
got
him!
Stand
clear!
All
right?
I'm
all
right.
Thanks.
Oh,
my
God.
Yes!

He's
going
to
be
OK.
Come
on,
lady.
Give
me
your
hand.
I
have
to,
Annie.
No,
Helen!
No,
Helen,
no!
Come
on!
Helen,
no!

I'm
here
at
the
105
Freeway,...
...where
the
police
No,
Helen!
Goddamn
it,
Mac,
...was
driving
the
bus.
...an
explosion.
Some
kind
of
an
explosion.
The
bus
hasn't
exploded,...
...but...
Oh,
my
God.
A
woman
caught
in
the
blast
fell.
She
was
pulled
under
the
wheels.
Interactive
TV,
Jack.
Wave
of
the
future,
huh?
I
can't
be
here.
I
can't,
you
know...
...this
is
the
wrong
bus.
I
mean,
for
me
to...
I
can't
die
here.
Hey,
shut
up,
man.
I
got
a
wife.
Oh,
you
do?
Hey!
So
if
you
have
a
wife...
...and
I
don't,
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
guy's
just
talking
crazy.
He
gets
on
my
nerves.
He
gets
on
everybody's
nerves.
Oh,
yeah?
I
think
I
have
the
right
to
be
a
little
upset.
What
are
you
staring
at,
anyway?
Why
don't
you
let
everybody...
...die
in
peace,
I'm
sure
you're
a
really
tough
guy,
huh?
Why
don't
we
just
step
outside?
Hey!
How
are
you
doing?
You
all
right?
Mm-mm.
What
can
I
do?
When
that
bomb
went
off...
I
know.
I
thought
that
was
it.
I
thought
that
was
the
bomb,
and
I
was
dead.
And
when
I
saw
her
body
fall
under
the
bus,
You
were
glad
you
were
still
alive.
Mm-hmm.
I'm
so
sorry.
Don't
be.
You
should
be
glad.
We
all
are.
It
doesn't
mean
you
don't
care.
I
know,
but
she
was
so
scared.
She
was
scared.
She
was
a
nice
lady
...but
if
she'd
gotten
off,
He's
the
asshole,
Annie,
Big
asshole.
OK.
Are
you
sure?
Well,
how
far?
Sir,
we
have
a
serious
problem.
What?
This
freeway
isn't
finished.
What
are
you
talking
about?
The
aerial
unit
caught
it.
..there's
a
section
missing.
Section
missing?
But
it's
on
the
map.
It's
finished
on
the
goddamn
map!
I
guess
they
fell
behind.
Fuck!
You're
fired.
Everybody's
fucking
fired!
Get
me
closer!
Hey,
get
closer.
Watch
him
in
the
mirror.
Jack!
How
big
is
the
section?
50
feet...
at
least.
There's
a
gap
in
the
road
up
ahead.
It's
big.
You're
kidding.
How
big?
50
feet.
What?
We
got
to
get
these
people
You
know
I
can't.

What
did...
what
did
he
say?
Jack?
Jack,
what
did
he
say?
What's
the
matter?
There's
a
gap
in
the
freeway.
What?
What
do
you
mean?
How
big
is
a
gap?
50
feet,
a
couple
of
miles
ahead.
This
is
crazy.
What
is
this?
Jeez.
Jack.
What
if
I
shift
into
neutral...
..and
just
keep
the
engine
reving?
No,
he'd
have
thought
of
that.
Well,
what,
then?
What?
What?
Jack?
Floor
it.
What?
Floor
it!
It's
an
interchange.
Fine.
Everybody
hold
onto
your
seats
When
we
hit
the
gap,
heads
down.
That's
it?
That's
it?
That's
all
we
can
do.
Let's
put
these
underneath
your
seat,
Put
your
bags
underneath
the
seat.
Hey,
I
didn't
mean
to
shoot
the
guy.
Hold
on.
Is
this
really
going
to
work?

Jack.
Yeah?
Jack.
Come
on,
come
on.
Oh,
God.
Come
on!
Oh,
God.
Oh,
shit.
Everybody
hold
on!
Oh,
I
want
to
see
our
baby.
Oh,
God.
Jack.
Shit!
Yes!
We
are
way
out
of
control!

You
OK?
Yeah.
You
OK?
I'm
OK.
All
right!
Go
on!
Let's
go!
Is
everybody
OK?
Yes!
We
did
it!
We
made
it.
You
are
the
man!
Thank
you.
Thank
you
very
much.
Yes!
We
made
it!
Yeah!
Oh,
shit.
I
think
you
missed
your
calling.
Yeah?
What
was
it?
Watch
the
road.
Ow.
Get
off.
What?
Get
off
this.
Now,
now.
Get
off
this.
In
there.
-
Where?
Right
here?
-
Right
here?
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
He's
just
entered
the
airport.
There's
thousands
of
people
there.
That's
my
boy
Jack.
He'll
be
able
to
circle
the
runways
Choppers
can't
fly
in
there.
He's
headed
for
the
end
of
the
field.
That
must
be
Bravo
Tango,
Let's
hope
it's
built.
Let's
move!
We're
at
the
airport.
Yeah?
So?
I
already
seen
the
airport.

Yeah?
Very,
very
exciting,
Jack.
Some
close
calls,
huh?
But
you've
done...
..all
right
for
yourself.
What
do
you
want?
I
want
money,
Jack.
I
wish
I
had
some
loftier
purpose,...
..but
I'm
afraid
in
the
end
I
would
like
large
non-sequential
bills...
..in
two
clear
plastic
bags,
unmarked.
Can
you
remember
all
that?
What
are
you
telling
me
for?
Because
I
want
you
to
help
me
I
hate
negotiators.
They
talk
to
you
..and
they
don't
even
know
you.
Why
are
they
messing
with
me?
Do
they
think
I'm
doing
this
for
fun?
Aren't
you?
Oh,
that's
unfair,
Jack.
You
don't
know
how
I
feel
about
this.
You
don't
even
know
me.
I
know
you
want
a
shit
load
of
money
Oh,
I
earned
it.
I
spent
my
life
earning
it.
I
got
a
medal,
too,
Jack,
a
medal...
...and
a
pink
slip
You
have
to
let
me
off.
Oh,
no.
That's
not
good.
You
want
me
to
help
you?
I
need
to
talk
to
these
people
face
to
face.
They
think
you're
bullshit.
They
don't
think
that.
You
want
the
money,
Let
me
get
on
the
ground.
Just
me.
That's
not
against
the
rules.
All
right.
I
want
you
back
real
fast.
Fine.
Jack,
nothing
tricky
now.
You
know
that
I'm
on
top
of
you.
Do
not
attempt
to
grow
a
brain.
So
I
guess
there's
a
plan
now?
Could
be.
Yeah?
He's
letting
me
off.
What?
Just
keep
circling.
You'll
be
fine.
Everybody,
sit
tight.
Do
you
think
that's
a
good
idea?
Are
you
just
gonna
leave
us
here?
I
would.
Don't
worry.
I
won't
go
far.
Hey.
Don't
forget
about
us.
The
choppers
are
gone.
No
way.
He's
ready
for
that.
How
is
that
possible?
I
don't
know
how.
I
just
know
he
is.
He's
been
a
step
ahead
every
time.
If
we
unload,
Where
does
that
put
us?
I
have
to
try
and
dismantle
that
bomb.

...this
Santa
Monica
bus
has
ended
up
here...
...at
Los
Angeles
International
Airport,...
...circling
the
runway.
I'm
telling
you,
honey,
He
didn't
have
to
get
Get
your
ass
behind
the
yellow
line.
What
is
that?

I
have
no
idea.
We
won't
be
able
to
hold
this
steady
I
just
need
a
few
minutes.
...I
can't
do
it
at
all.
Harry,
you
with
me?

Yeah.
You
be
careful,
Jack.
What's
he
doing?
Oh,
my
God.
He
is
insane.
OK,
Jack,...
...this
is
it.
Don't
get
dead.
This
isn't
a
very
good
plan.
Have
faith,
sister.
Oh,
Christ.
Just
keep
it
steady.
Thank
you
for
the
tip,
Ortiz.
This
guy
is
nuts!
Gosh.
We'll
try
to
bypass
Can
you
find
the
remote's
tripwire?
I
don't
know.
I
got
a
few
choices
here.
Black
andred?
And
green.
OK,
I'm
gonna
guess
he's
not
gonna
go...
...with
standard
copper
for
the
remote.
That
would
be
too
weak.
I'd
use
a
fibre
alloy.
I
need
you
to
look
at
the
wire.
Harry,
it's
covered.
I
know.
But
don't
cut
the
wire.
Right.
Fuck
me!
Shit!
-
Bull's-eye!
OK,
I
want
you
to
clip
on
the
battery...
...and
then
run
it
to
the
lead
wire.
Copy.

I
can't
bypass.
It'll
fire.
Oh,
shit!
It's
a
collapsible
circuit.
Howard
Payne,

Squad.
Retired
in
Sun
Valley
in
1989...
...when
a
small
charge
That's
our
scumbag!
We
got
him.
We
can
get
to
his
place
Jack,
I
want
you
We're
going
to
go
after
the
source.
Watch
your
back.
Wait!
Wait
for
me!
Mac,
get
me
outta
here.
Somebody
go
to
the
back
and
check
-
Can
you
see
him?
-
What?
Oh,
my
God.
Go
look!
Lay
down
and
look
under
the
bus
Can
you
see
him?
No.
You
don't
see
him
I
can't
see
him.
-
Are
you
sure?
We
hit
him!
Oh,
my
God!
Do
you
see
him?
Did
we
hit
him?
Look
out
the
sides.
My
tools!
Somebody
get
him
his
tools!
Please
help
him!
Hurry!
God,
we're
dragging
him.
Do
you
see
him?
Where
is
he?
Is
he
there?

Do
you
see
him?
Jack!
Jack!
I
see
him!
What?
I
see
him!
Is
he
OK?
He's
all
right!
What?!
What?!
Hold
my
legs.
Somebody
hold
my
legs.
Hold
his
legs.
Hold
his
legs.
Come
on!
Come
on!
I
got
ya!
Is
he
hurt?
Is
he
OK?
Pull!
Pull!
Come
on!
Come
on!
We
got
him
now.
Come
on,
pull!
Jesus.
I
can't
believe
it.
You're
a
complete
jerk.
You
know
that?
Thank
God.
Have
any
luck
with
the
bomb?
Yeah.
It
didn't
go
off.
Ortiz,
thanks.
How
many
lives
you
got,
man?
You're
not
too
bright,
man,...
...but
you
got
some
big,
round,
hairy
cojones.
That's...
very
gross,
Ortiz.
Huh.
Can't
even
pay
him
a
compliment.
How
you
doing?
You
scared
the
shit
out
of
me,
Jack!
Ow!
Other
than
that,
I'm
fine.
What
is
that
smell?
It's
gas.
We're
leaking
gas?
We
are
now.
You
felt
you
needed
Mac.
Mac
here.
Go
ahead.
Can
you
get
a
fuel
truck
to
pace
us?
I'll
see
what
I
can
find.
How
much
time?
I
don't
know.
10
minutes?
It
doesn't
look
good.
Gotcha.
Get
a
fuel
car
out
here...
...on
the
double.
Is
that
going
to
work?
I
don't
know.
Come
on,
Harry.
Save
my
life.


Harry,
tell
me
good
news,
man.
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
Jack.
He
didn't
make
it.
You
fuck!
It
was
the
watch
It
seemed
a
little
hammy
to
me...
...to
build
the
bomb
...but
I
figured
...would
be
pushing
it.
I'm
going
to
rip
your
fucking
spine
out,
You're
gonna
do
exactly
as
you're
told.
Jack,
we
both
know
that
he
was
the
brain...
...of
your
particular
operation.
You
can't
beat
me.
You're
going
to
pay
me
every
dollar.
Otherwise,
you,
the
wildcat...
...and
every
innocent
person
on
that
bus...
...are
going
to
end
up
just
like
your
friend.
Are
you
paying
attention?
Jack,
are
you
listening...
...to
me?
Jack?
Jack?
Yeah.
Good.
You
tell
them
that
the
drop
point
There's
a
garbage
can
You
drop
the
bags
and
leave.
I
don't
show
until
all
your
people
are
gone.
It's
getting
on
to
11
am,
Jack,...
...and
I
think
Jack.
Damn
it!
Damn
him!
Damn
it!
Don't
give
up
on
me!
Jack,
stop
it!
Jack,
come
on!
Stop
it,
OK?
We're
really
scared
I
can't
do
this
by
myself.
Please?
Jack,
please.
OK?
Please?
All
right?
We're
going
to
die.
No,
we're
not.
We
got
this
far,
OK?
I'll
be
damned.
Did
you
go
to
the...
...University
of
Arizona?
Yeah?
So?
Good
football
team.
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
I
don't
really
know.
Arizona
Wildcats.
Right.
He
can
see
you.
What?
He
can
see
you.
Just
keep
looking
straight
ahead.
He
called
you
a
wildcat
before.
Bastard's
got
a
camera
He
can
see
the
whole
bus.
He's
been
playing
me
from
minute
one.
Well,
he
can
see
me,
Doesn't
look
like
it.

A
citybus
rigged
to
explode
..races
around
literally
in
circles
The
two
dead
are
a
female
passenger
..of
another
bus,
The
other
people
in
jeopardy
are,
of
course,
..held
hostage
at
the
whim
of
a
mad
man.
"The
whim
of
a
madman."
I
like
that.
There's
a
camera
on
the
bus
I
want
you
to
stare...
..straight
ahead.
Don't
make
any
big
movements,
OK?
It's
Jack.
Yeah,
I
know
about
Harry.
Is
that
news
van
still
around?
Get
those
cameras
to
stop
taping.
LAPD.
I
need
this
unit.
You
can
broadcast
UHF,
right?
Yeah,
sure.
There's
a
signal
going
to
that
bus.
I
want
you
to
find
it.

Emergency.
Please,
sir,
stop
taping.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Good!
Tape
off
of
that.
Remember,
no
big
movements.
That
ain't
gonna
be
too
hard.
Tape
it.
Good.
Come
on.
Tape
it.
It's
taping!
Jack.
Yeah?
Look.
Mac,
fuel.
Jack,
five
minutes.
Not
enough
time.
Run
the
tape.
We
have
to
unload.
I
only
have
a
minute
of
tape.
Do
it
now.
I
want
you
to
make
a
tape
and
loop
it
All
right,
run
it.
Run
it!
All
right.
Tape's
rolling.

We
still
have
no
live
picture,...
..but
reports
are

Everyone
is
safe
for
the
moment.
Hard
to
imagine
what's
going
Certainly,
a
sense
of
community...
Rig
the
steering
wheel
and
the
gas
pedal.
All
right,
let's
get
them
off.
OK,
you,
you,
and
you.

Police
have
just
issued
..which
really
doesn't
tell
us
much
more...
Grab
my
wrist.
That's
it.
Good.
Come
on.
Look
straight
ahead.
Come
on.

The
bomber
snuck
in
here
Come
on.
It's
OK.
That's
good,
that's
good.
Grab
my
wrist.
Take
his
hand.
That's
it.
Come
on.
Let's
go.
Come

buddy.
I

ya.
Give
me
your
hand.
Your
hand.
Hold
on.
Hold
on.
Grab
my
hand.
Don't
look
down.
Shit!
Jack!
Grab
my
hand!
Grab
my
hand!
Jack,
I
can't
hold
this
any
more.
Annie!
You...
hold
on!
No,
no!
No!
Hold
it.
Oh,
God.
Wedge
down
the
gas
pedal.
OK,
I
got
it.
You
got
it?
Yeah.
I
got
it.
OK
OK,
Annie,
get
on.
Oh,
God.
Jack,
I
can't
do
this.
Let's
go!
Shit.
Shit,

Jack.
Shit!
Hold
on.
Shit!

Are
you
all
right?
No.
It's
OK.
It's
OK.
It's
over.
It's
over.
You
did
it.
You
did
it.
Oh,
I
hate
the
airport.
You're
not
going
to
get
mushy
on
me,
Maybe.
I
think
I
might.
I
hope
not
because
relationships
that
start
Oh,
yeah?
Yeah.
Here
comes
the
cavalry.
How
ya
doing?
We're
OK.
I
just
might
be
a
nice
guy...
...and
let
you
have
the
rest
of
the
day
off.
Oh,
boy.
Mac,
this
is
Annie.
Annie,
meet
Lieutenant
McMahon.
How
you
doing?
OK.
This
should
take
care
of
it.
Ow!
Watch
it.
Sorry.
We're
going
to
take
you
guys
back
Lieutenant!
It's
him.
He
wants
to
know
Son
of
a
bitch.
I'll
tell
him
He
doesn't
know
it
blew
up.
30
minutes.
I'll
be
right
back.
All
right,
here's
our
target.
Fox!
Yes,
sir!
I
want
you
in
4-1,
you
in
1-2.
You're
in
3.
Let's
move
it.
Are
you
sure
the
paint
bomb
It's
done,
sir.
Too
bad,
Jack.

The
SWATvan
OK.
We'll
report
across
the
landing
field
We
still
have
no
live
picture.
Reports
are
that
the
bus
...inside
LAX.
...potentially
a
disastrous
situation.
It's
definitely
been
defused
to
some
extent.
No!
No!
Miss.
Hmm?
You
can't
be
this
close.
No.
Jack
Traven
said...
Jack
Traven
asked
Just
move
right
over
here.
He's
running
a
little
late.
He's
not
late.
What?
He's
never
late.
Well,
that
money
hasn't
moved.
We
got
200
eyes
on
that
can,...
...a
bird
dog
in
the
bag.
Turn
it
on.
What
for?
It
hasn't
moved.
Just
do
it.

Shit.
It's
moving.
He's
got
the
money.
Jack!
Shit!
Freeze!
Pop
quiz,..
..asshole.
You
have
a
hair
trigger
aimed
at
your
head.
What
do
you
do?
What
do
you
do?
Turn
around.
Turn
around!
Oh,
no.
I'm
sorry.
Be
prepared.
It's
the
boy
Scout
marching
song.
What
are
you
gonna
do,
Jack?
I
don't
think
you
can
shoot
her.
Let
her
go.
No,
I
don't
think
I'm
gonna
do
that.
Fill
it.
Now.
Well,
I
think
Harry
...feeling
that
we're
right
back
Let
her
go.
Take
it
and
walk.
Come
on.
Just
take
it
and
walk.
You
don't
need
her.
Just
take
your
goddamn
money
and
walk!
Stay
right
there.
I'll
do
it.
I'll
let
go.
I'll
let
go.
Oh,
yeah.
You
still
don't
get
it.
Do
you,
Jack?
Huh?
The
beauty
of
it.
A
bomb
is
made
to
explode.
That's
its
meaning,
its
purpose.
Your
life
is
empty
because
you
spend
it...
...trying
to
stop
the
bomb
from
becoming.
And
for
who?
For
what?
Do
you
know
what
a
bomb
is,
Jack,...
...that
doesn't
explode?
It
is
a
cheap
gold
watch,
buddy.
You're
crazy.
You're
fucking
crazy.
Oh,
no.
Poor
people
are
crazy,
Jack.
I'm
eccentric.
Get
the
money.
Let's
go.
Come
on!
Let's
go!
Move
it!
Move
it!
You
stay!
Move
it!
Move
it!
In
the
door.
In
that
door!
Now!
Bye,
Jack.
Punk.


All
right!
Get
in
there.
Go
on.
Get
in.
You
get
back
in
there!
You
get
this
train
moving!
Go
on!
Are
these
seats
taken?
No.
Go.
All
aboard.
Doors
will
be
closing.
Come
on.
Back
over
here.
All
aboard.
Doors
will
be
closing.
No!
Damn.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Please
report,
Westbound
501.
What
is
your
position?
Westbound
501,
please
check
in.
Westbound
501.
We
have
police
orders
Do
you
copy?
You
have
to
hold
this.
It's
like
a
grenade.
Don't
let
it
go.
Huh?
I'm
counting
on
you.
Do
you
copy?
Hey!
I'll
take
it
from
here.
No!
No!
No!

Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Wait.
No!
No!
Maybe
you'd
better
I'm
afraid
you're
a
bit
hysterical...
..and
you
might
let
this
go
a
might
early.
Hey!
Hey,
buckaroo!
It's
not
'cause
you're
a
woman,
all
right?
Hey,
it's
all
right.
Looks
like
we're
all
alone.
Look,
you
won.
OK?
Just
throw
me
offthe
train.
I
don't
care.
This
stick,....
huh?
Works
on
a
remote.
When
you
explode,...
...that's
where
they'll
come,
I
have
a
different
plan.
Mess
like
that,...
Gives
me
more
time.
It's
not
gonna
hurt,
Annie.

Jeez!

Hey,
Jack,
is
that
you?
He's
so
persistent.
Wouldn't
be
able
I've
got,
uh,
plenty
to
go
around.
My
money.
You
bastard!
How
does
that
feel?
You
like
that,
huh?
You
like
it,...
...you
bastard?
My
money!
Shit!
You!
I'm
coming
for
you,
Jack!
You
know
you're
finished,
kid!
Hey,
I'll
drop
the
stick,
boy.
You
want
that?
I
got
you.
I'm
gonna
get
you.
Oh,
yes!
Yes!
Yes!

What
do
you
do,
Jack?
What
do
you
do?
Piece
of
shit!
I'm
the
guy
with
a
plan
I'm
smarter
than
you.


Yeah.
But
I'm
taller.
Jack.
Jack!
Oh,
God!
I
thought
you
were
dead.
Jack.
Where
did...
Here.
Turn
around.
Where's
Payne?
He
lost
his
head.
Oh,
God.
Let's
take
this
off,
shall
we?
Yes.
Let's
take
this
off.
Ohh.
Take
it
off.
Hello?
Hello?
Does
anyone
copy?

Jack,
this
is
Mac.
Can
you
hear
me?
Jack,
if
you're
there,...
...you've
got
to
stop
the
train.
The
track
isn't
finished.
Mac,
I
copy.

...not
finished.
Mac.
If
someone
can
hear
me...
Mac,...
...can
you
hear
me?
Try
the
emergency
brake.
Jack,
do
you
copy?
Jack...
Nothing
works!
Annie,
you
won't
believe
this.
What?
We
have
to
jump.
You
can't
stop
it?
Well,
um,
OK,
undo
me,
I
don't
have
a
key.
What?
I
don't
have
the
key.
Shit.

You
got
to
get
off...
Please!
This
track
dead-ends.
You
got
to
get
off
this
train.
This
is
crazy.
There's
a
curve
ahead.
I'm
gonna
speed
it
up,...
...make
it
jump
the
track.
This
is
really
stupid,
Jack.
Jack,
please.
You
can
still
jump.
Jack,
please.
Please,...
...Jack?

OK,...
...we
have
to
start
here.

Holy
shit!
What
the
hell
is
that?
Back
off!

I
can't
believe
he
hit
my
van.
Come
on.
It's
all
right.
Unreal.
You
didn't
leave
me.
I
can't
believe
it.
You
didn't
leave
me.
Didn't
have
anywhere
to
be
just
then.
Check
it
out.
I
have
to
warn
you.
I've
heard
relationships...
...based
on
intense
experiences
never
work.
OK,...
...we'll
have
to
base
it
on
sex,
then.
Whatever
you
say,
ma'am.
