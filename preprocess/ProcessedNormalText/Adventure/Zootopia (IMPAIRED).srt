YOUNG
JUDY:
Fear.
Treachery
Bloodlust.
Thousands
of
years
ago...
these
were
the
forces
A
world
where
prey
And
predators
had
an
uncontrollable...
biological
urge...
to
maim,
and
maul,
and...

-

-
Blood!
Blood!
Blood!


And
death.



Back
then,
the
world
was
divided
in
two.
-
Vicious
predator...
or
meek
prey.

JUDY:
But
over
time,
we
evolved.
And
moved
beyond
Now,
predator
and
prey
live
in
harmony.

And
every
young
mammal
has
Yeah.
I
don't
have
to
cower
in
a
herd
anymore.
Instead,
I
can
be
an
astronaut.
-

I
don't
have
to
be
Today,
I
can
hunt
for
tax
exemptions.
I'm
gonna
be
an
actuary!

And
I
can
make
the
world
a
better
place.
I
am
going
to
be...

a
police
officer!

Bunny
cop?
That
is
the
most
It
may
seem
impossible
to
small
minds...
I'm
looking
at
you,
Gideon
Grey.

But,
just
211
miles
away...
stands
the
great
city
of
Zootopia!
Where
our
ancestors
first
and
declared
that
anyone
can
be
anything!
-

Thank
you
and
good
night!
STU:
Judy,
you
ever
wonder
got
to
be
so
darn
happy?
Nope.
Well,
we
gave
up
on
our
dreams
Oh,
yes,
that's
right,
Stu.
See,
that's
the
beauty
If
you
don't
try
anything
new,
I
like
trying
actually.
What
you
father
means,
hon...
is
it's
gonna
be
difficult...
impossible
even,
for
you
Right.
There's
never
been
a
bunny
cop.
-
No.
-
Never.
Oh.
Then,
I
guess
Because
I
am
gonna
make...
-
the
world
a
better
place.
Or,
uh,
heck,
about
making
the
world
a
better
place...
no
better
way
to
do
it
than
Yes!
Your
dad,
me...
your
275
brothers
and
sisters.
-
We're
changing
the
world!
-
One
carrot
at
a
time.
Carrot
farming
is
a
noble
profession.
-
Mmm-hmm.
BONNIE:
Just
putting
the
seeds
STU:
Ah,
at
one
with
the
soil.
-

It's
great
to
have
dreams.
Yeah.
Just
as
long
as
you
don't
Where'd
the
heck
she
go?
YOUNG
GIDEON:
or
I'm
gonna
kick
your...
-
meek
little
sheep
butt.
Cut
it
out,
Gideon!
Baa!
Baa!
What
are
you
gonna
do?
Cry?
Hey!
You
heard
her.
Cut
it
out.
Nice
costume,
loser.
What
crazy
world
are
you
living
in...
where
you
think
a
bunny
could
be
a
cop?
Kindly
return
my
friend's
tickets.
Come
and
get
them.
But
watch
out,
because
I'm
a
fox...
and
like
you
said
in
your
us
predators
used
to
eat
prey.
And
that
killer
instinct
Uh,
I'm
pretty
much
sure
Don't
tell
me
what
I
know,
Travis.
You
don't
scare
me,
Gideon.
-

TRAVIS:
Look
at
her
nose
twitch!
She
is
scared!
Cry
little
baby
bunny.
Cry,
cry...
-


Oh,
you
don't
know
when
to
quit,
do
you?
-



I
want
you
to
remember
this
moment
you
will
ever
be
anything
more
-
carrot-farming,
dumb
bunny.


That
looks
bad.
Are
you
okay,
Judy?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm
okay.
-
Here
you
go.
Wow!
You
got
our
tickets!
You're
awesome,
Judy!
Yeah,
that
Gideon
Grey
doesn't
Well,
he
was
right
about
one
thing.
I
don't
know
when
to
quit.

Listen,

know
what
around

but
I
don't
want
any

in
here.
So,
hit
the

the

to

you
probably
can't
read,

but
the

says...
"We

"...to

So,
beat
it.
You're
holding
up

Hello?
Excuse
me.
Hey,
you're
gonna
have
like
everyone
else,
meter
maid.
Actually,
I'm
an

Just
had
a
quick
question.
Are
your
customers
aware...
they're
getting
snot
and
mucus...
with
their
cookies
and
cream?

What
are
you
talking
about?
Well,
I
don't
want
to
but
I
believe
scooping
ice
cream...
with
an
ungloved
trunk
is
a
Class
3...
health
code
violation.
Which
is
kind
of
a
big
deal.

Of
course,
I
could
let
you
off
if
you
were
to
glove
those
finish
selling
this
nice
dad

What
was
it?
A
Jumbo
Pop.
Please.

$15.
Thank
you
so
much.
Thank
you.
Oh,
no.
Are
you
kidding
me?

I'd
lose
my
head
if
it
weren't
That's
the
truth.
Oh,
boy.
I'm
sorry,
pal.
Got
to
be
about
the
worst
birthday
ever.
Please
don't
be
mad
at
me.
Thanks
anyway.
Keep
the
change.
NICK:
Officer,
I
can't
thank
you
enough.
So
kind,
really.
Can
I
pay
you
back?
Oh,
no,
my
treat.
It
just...
You
know,
it
burns
me
up
to
see
folks...
with
such
backward
attitudes
toward
foxes.
I
just
wanna
say
you're
a
real
articulate

that
is
high
praise.
It's
rare
that
I
find

Well,
you
can't.
You
can

you
are.
Sly

dumb

-
I'm
not
a
dumb

Right.
And
that's
not

You'll
never
be

You're
a

that.
Oh,
my

you
a
meter
maid?
Oh,

No!
Oh,

This
is
Oh,
it's
the
safest
job
on
the
force!
STU:
Oh,
she's
not
a
real
cop.
Our
prayers
have
been
answered!
BONNIE:
Glorious
day!
STU:

Oh,
meter
maid!
Metermaid!
-
Metermaid!
Metermaid!
It's
been
a
really
long
day.
That's
right,
you
get
some
rest.
Those
meters
aren't
gonna
maid
themselves.
Bye-bye.
Buh-bye.

ORYX:
Hey,
buddy,
turn
down

KUDU:
Leave
the
meter
maid
alone.
Didn't
you
hear
her
conversation?
She
feels
like
a
failure!
ORYX:
Oh,
shut
up!
ORYX:
You
shut
up!
-
KUDU:
You
shut
up!
Tomorrow's
another
day.
KUDU:
Yeah,
but
it
might
be
worse!


I
was

seconds
over!

Ugh!
Yeah,
you're
a
real
hero,

My
mommy

she
wishes
you
were
dead.

Uncool,

I
am
a

I

hey!
You,

Sir.
If
you

What

you
talking
about?
My

It
was
just
robbed!
Look!

He's
getting
away!
Are
you
a

not?
Oh,
yes!
Yes!
Don't
worry,

JUDY:
Stop!
Stop,

of
the

Catch
me

you
can,

Whoa.
Coming

This

I

Officer
Hopps.
I

Whoo-whoo!

Whoa!

Ha!




JUDY:
You!
Freeze!
Hey,
meter
maid!
Wait
for
the
real
cops!
Stop!

Oh...






Oh!

Sorry.
Coming
through.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Pardon.


Bon

Huh?

JUDY:
Ha!
Oh...

Hey,

there!
Have

Oh,
my
God.
Did
you
see

Oh!

I
love
your

Thank
you.

Come
to
papa.
-

Okay.
You're
gonna
have
to
be
patient...
and
wait
in
line
-
Mrs.
Otterton.
Okay?
-

I
popped
the
weasel!
Hopps!
BOGO:
Abandoning
your
post.
Inciting
a
scurry.
Reckless
endangerment
of
rodents.
But,
to
be
fair...
you
did
stop
a
master
criminal...
from
stealing
two
dozen
moldy
onions.
Mmm.
Hate
to
disagree
with
you,
sir...
but
those
aren't
onions.
Those
are
a
crocus
varietal
They're
a
Class-C
botanical,
sir.
Well,
I
grew
up
in
a
family
Shut
your
tiny
mouth
now!
Sir,
I
got
the
bad
guy.
That's
my
job.
Your
job
is
putting
tickets...
-
on
parked
cars!
CLAWHAUSER:
Chief...
uh,
Mrs.
Otterton's
here
to
see
you
again.
-
Not
now.
If
you'd
want
to
take
it
this
time.
She
seems
really
upset.
-
Not
now!
I
don't
want
to
be
a
meter
maid...
I
want
to
be
a
real
cop.
Do
you
think
the
mayor
asked
when
he
assigned
you
to
me?
But,
sir,
if...
Life
isn't
some
cartoon
musical...
where
you
sing
a
little
song...
and
your
insipid
dreams
-
So,
let
it
go.
Chief
Bogo,
please.
Five
minutes
of
your
time.
Please.

I'm
sorry,
sir.
I
tried
to
stop
her.
I
gotta
go
sit
down.
Ma'am,
as
I've
told
you,
My
husband
has
been
missing
for
10
days.
His
name
is
Emmitt
Otterton.
BOGO:
Yes,
I
know.
He's
a
florist.
We
have
two
beautiful
children.
He
would
never
just
disappear.
BOGO:
Ma'am,
our
detectives
are
very
busy.
Please.
There's
got
to
be
somebody
Mrs.
Otterton...
JUDY:
I
will
find
him.
MRS.
OTTERTON:

Oh!
Thank
you.
-
Bless
you.
Bless
you,
little
bunny.

Oh.
Take
this.
Find
my
Emmitt.
Bring
him
home...
to
me
and
my
babies,
please.

Mrs.
Otterton,
please
wait
out
here.
Of
course.
Oh,
thank
you
both
so
much.
One
second.
You're
fired.
What?
Why?
Insubordination!
Now.
I'm
going
to
open
this
door...
and
you're
going
to
tell
that
otter...
you're
a
former
meter
maid...
with
delusions
of
grandeur...
who
will
not
be
taking
the
case!
I
just
heard
Officer
Hopps
Assistant
Mayor
Bellwether.
The
Mammal
Inclusion
Initiative...
is
really
starting
to
pay
off.

Mayor
Lionheart
is
just
gonna
No,
no,
let's
not
tell
the
Mayor
just
yet.
And
I've
sent
it
and
it
is
All
right.
Well,
I'd
say
Us
little
guys
really
need
to
Like
glue.

Good
one.
Just
call
me
if
you
ever
You've
always
got
a
friend
All
right,
bye-bye.
Thank
you,
ma'am.

I
will
give
you
48
hours.
Yes!
That's
two
days
to
find
Emmitt
Otterton.
Okay.
But,
you
strike
out,
you
resign.
Oh!
Uh...
Okay.
Deal!
Splendid.
Clawhauser
will
give
you
CLAWHAUSER:
Here
you
go.
One
missing
otter.
JUDY:
That's
it?
Yikes!
That
is
the
smallest
CLAWHAUSER:
Leads,
none.
Witnesses,
none.
And
you're
not
so
resources,
none!

Oh,
I
hope
you
didn't
stake
your
career...
on
cracking
this
one!
JUDY:
Okay.
Last
known
sighting.

Can
I
just
borrow...
Thank
you.
Popsicle?
The
murder
weapon.
Get
your
Popsicle.
Yeah.
Because
that...
What
does
that
mean?
It
means...
I
have
a
lead.


Hi!
Hello?
It's
me,
again!
-
Hey,
it's
Officer
Toot-Toot.
No.
Actually,
it's
Officer
Hopps...
and
I'm
here
to
ask
you
What
happened,
meter
maid?
Did
someone
steal
a
traffic
cone?
It
wasn't
me.

Hey,
Carrots,
you're
going
I
gotta
get
to
work.
This
is
important,
sir.
I
think
your
$10
worth

I
make
200
bucks
a
day,
Fluff!
365
days
a
year,
since
I
was
12.
And
time
is
money.
Hop
along.
Please,
just
look
at
the
picture.
You
sold
Mr.
Otterton
Do
you
know
him?
I
know
everybody.
And
I
also
know
that,
somewhere...
there's
a
toy
store
missing
so
why
don't
you
get
back
to
your
box?
Fine.
Then
we'll
have

Did
you
just
boot
my
stroller?
Nicholas
Wilde,
you
are
under
arrest.
Ha!
For
what?

Felony
Tax
Evasion.
Yeah,
$200
a
day,
365
days
a
year...
since
you
were
12.
That's
two
decades,
so
times
20...
which
is
$1,460,000,
I
think.

I
mean,
but
we
are
good
at
multiplying.
Anyway,
according
to
your
tax
forms...
you
reported,
let
me
see
here...
zero!
Unfortunately,
lying
on
a
federal
form...
is
a
punishable
offense.
Five
years
jail
time.
Well,
it's
my
word
against
yours.
ON
RECORDING:
200
bucks
a
day,
Fluff!
365
days
a
year,
since
I
was
12.
Actually,
it's
your
word
against
yours.
And
if
you
want
this
pen,
find
this
poor,
missing
otter...
or
the
only
place
you'll
be
is
the
prison
cafeteria.
It's
called
a
hustle,
sweetheart.
FINNICK:
She
hustled
you.


She
hustled
you
good!
You
a
cop
now,
Nick.

Have
fun...
working
with
the
fuzz!

Start
talking.

I
don't
know
where
he
is.
I
only
saw
where
he
went.
Great.
Let's
go.
It's
not
exactly
a
place
for,
uh...
a
cute
little
bunny.
Don't
call
me
cute.
Get
in
the
car.
Okay.
You're
the
boss.

YAX:

Om!


Hi.
Hello?

Om!
Um,
hello?
Hello?
Hello?
-

Hmm?
-
JUDY:
Hello.
My
name
is...
You
know,
I'm
going
to
hit...
the
pause
button
right
there...
because
we're
all
good
Uh...
no.
I'm
Officer
Hopps,
ZPD.
I'm
looking
for
a
missing
mammal...
Emmitt
Otterton,
right
here...
who
may
have
frequented

-


Hmm.
Yeah,
old
Emmitt.

Haven't
seen
him
in
a
couple
of
weeks.
But,
hey,
you
should
talk
I'd
be
happy
to
take
you
back.
Oh,
thank
you
so
much.
more
than
you
can
imagine,
-
Ohh!
You
are
naked!
Oh,
for
sure,
we're
Yeah.
In
Zootopia,
anyone
can
be
anything.
These
guys,
they
be
naked.
Nangi's
just
on
the
other
side

NICK:
Oh,
boy.
Does
this
make
you
uncomfortable?
Because
if
so,
there
is
no
Yes,
there
is.
Boy,
that's
the
spirit.

YAX:
Yeah,
some
mammals
say...
the
naturalist
life
is
weird...
but
you
know
what
I
say
is
weird?
Clothes
on
animals!
-
Here
we
go.
As
you
can
see,
Nangi's
an
elephant...
so
she'll
totally
remember
everything.
Hey,
Nangi.
These
dudes
have
some
questions...
about
Emmitt
the
otter.
Who?
Uh...
Emmitt
Otterton?
Been
coming
to
your
yoga
class
for
like...
6
years?
I
have
no
memory
of
this
beaver.
He's
an
otter,
actually.
He
was
here
a
couple
No.
Yeah,
he
was
wearing...
a
green
cable-knit
sweater
vest...
and
a
new
pair
of
corduroy
slacks.
Oh,
and
a
paisley
tie,
sweet
Windsor
knot.
Real
tight.
Remember
that,
Nangi?
No.
Yeah,
and
we
both
walked
this
big
old
white
car
with
a
silver
trim.
Needed
a
tune-up.
The
third
-
Remember
that,
Nangi?

Uh...
the
license
plate
number,
did
you?
Oh,
for
sure.
It
was
2-9...
T-H-D...
-
0-3.
This
is
a
lot
of
great
info.
Thank
you.
Told
you
Nangi
has
a
mind
I
wish
I
had
a
memory
like
an
elephant.
Well,
I
had
a
ball.
You
are
welcome
for
the
clue...
and
seeing
as
how
any
moron
I
will
take
that
pen
and
bid
you
adieu.
The
plate.
I
can't
run
a
plate.

I'm
not
in
the
system
yet.
Give
me
the
pen,
please.
What
was
it
you
said?
"Any
moron
can
run
a
plate"?
Gosh.
If
only
there
were
a
moron
around...
who
were
up
to
the
task.
Rabbit,
I
did
what
you
asked!
You
can't
keep
me
on
the
hook
forever.
Not
forever.
Well,
I
only
to
solve
this
case.
So
can
you
run
the
plate
or
not?
Actually,
I
just
remembered...
I
have
a
pal
at
the
DMV

Flash
is
the
fastest
guy
in
there.
If
you
need
something
done,
he's
on
it.
JUDY:
I
hope
so.
We
are
and
every
minute
counts.
Wait.
They're
all
sloths?

You
said
this
was
going
to
be
quick!
Are
you
saying
he
can't
be
fast?
I
thought
in
Zootopia,
Flash,
Flash,
hundred-yard
dash.
Buddy,
it's
nice
to
see
you.
Nice
to...
see
you...
too.
Hey,
Flash,
I'd
love
you
Uh,

I've
forgotten
your

Hmm.

Okay.

don't...

What...

you
call...
-

Pregnant.


Ha-ha!
Yes,

Hey...

JUDY:
Oh,

Yes...

-
What...
Do...
-
No!
A

"Pregnant!"
Okay,
great,

It's

I
love
you.
I
owe
you.
Hurry!
We
gotta
beat
the
rush
hour,
and...
It's
night?
-

NICK:
Mmm.
And
I
will
bet
you...
you
don't
have
a
warrant
to
get
in.
Hmm?
Darn
it.
It's
a
bummer.
You
wasted
the
day
on
purpose.
Madam,
I
have
a
fake
badge.
I
would
never

It's
not

Well,

your

sad,
miserable

It
does.
100%.
Now,
since
you're
sans
warrant...
I
guess
we're...
done?

Fine.
We
are
done.
Here's
your
pen.
Hey!
First
off,
you
throw
like
a
bunny.
Second,
you're
a
very
sore
loser.
See
you
later,
Officer
Fluff.
So
sad
this
is
over.
The
thing
is,
you
don't
need
a
warrant...
if
you
have
probable
cause...
and
I'm
pretty
sure
I
saw...
a
shifty
lowlife
climbing
the
fence.
So
you're
helping
plenty.
Come
on.

2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
This
is
it!
Polar

Oh,
my
God!
The
Velvety
Pipes
of
Jerry
Vole.
-

Who
still
uses
CDs?
Carrots,
if
your
otter
was
here...
he
had
a
very
bad
day.
Those
are
claw
marks.
You
ever
seen
anything
like
this?
NICK:
No.
Oh,
wait,
look.
JUDY:
This
is
him,
Emmitt
Otterton.
He
was
definitely
here.
What
do
you
think
happened?
NICK:
Well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
Polar
bear
fur,
Rat
Pack
music,
fancy
cup?
I
know
whose
car
this
is.
We
got
to
go.
Why?
Whose
car
is
it?
The
most
feared
crime-boss
in
Tundratown.
They
call
him
Mr.
Big.
And
he
does
not
like
me.
So
we
gotta
go!
I'm
not
leaving.
This
is
a
crime
scene.
Well,
it's
gonna
be
if
Mr.
Big
finds
me
here...
so
we're
leaving
right
now.

Raymond!
And
is
that
Kevin?
Long
time,
no
see.
And,
speaking
of
"no
see"...
how
about
you
forget
you
saw
me,
huh?
For
old
times'
sake?
That's
a
no.

RAYMOND:
Oh...


What
did
you
do
that
made...
Mr.
Big
so
mad
at
you?
I,
uh,
I
may
have
sold
him
that
was
made
from
the
fur
of
a
skunk...
...'s
butt.
Oh,
sweet
cheese
and
crackers.

JUDY:

Is
that
Mr.
Big?

No.
JUDY:
What
about
him?
-
Is
that
him?

That's
got
to
be
him.
Stop
talking,
stop
talking,
stop
talking!
-
Huh.
This
is
a
simple...
Yeah.
Here...
Mmm...
This
is
a
simple
misunderstanding.
Oh...
You
come
here,
unannounced...
on
the
day
my
daughter
is
to
be
married.
Well,
actually,
we
were
brought
here...
against
our
will,
so...

The
point
is,
I
did
not
know
and
I
certainly
did
not
know
MR.
BIG:
Meh.
I
trusted
you,
Nicky.
I
welcomed
you
into
my
home.
We
broke
bread
together.
Gram-mama
made
you
a
cannoli.
And
how
did
you
repay
my
generosity?
With
a
rug
made
from
the
butt
of
a
skunk.
A
skunk-butt
rug.
You
disrespected
me.
You
disrespected
my
Gram-mama...
who
I
buried
in
that
skunk
butt
rug.
I
told
you
never
to
show
but
here
you
are...
snooping
around
with
this...
What
are
you?
A
performer?
What's
with
the
costume?
Sir.
I
am
a...
Mime!
She
is
a
mime.
This...
mime
cannot
speak.
You
can't
speak
if
you're
a
mime.
-
No,
I
am
a
cop.
And
I'm

So

all

I'm
going

Meh.
Then
I
have
only
one
request.
Say
hello
to
Gram-mama.
Ice

Whoa!

I
didn't
see
nothing!
And

Please!

Oh,

Hey,

Hey,

hey,
hey!
Hmm.

MR.
BIG:
Otterton
is
my
florist.
He's
like
a
part
of
the
family.
He
had
something
important
That's
why
I
sent
that
car
to
pick
him
up.
But
he
never
arrived.
Because
he
was
attacked.
No.
He
attacked.
Otterton?
Otterton.
He
went
crazy.
Ripped
up
the
car,
scared
and
disappeared
into
the
night.
But
he's
a
sweet
little
otter.
Hmm.
My
child,
we
may
we
are
still
animals.
You
want
to
find
Otterton,
His
name
is
Manchas...
Iives
in
the
Rainforest
District.
Only
he
can
tell
you
more.

Mr.
Manchas?
Judy
Hopps,
ZPD.
We
just
wanna
know
what

MANCHAS:
You...
should
be
asking...
-
what
happened
to
me.
Uh,
a
teensy
otter
did
that?

What
happened?
He
was
an
animal.
Down...
on
all
fours.
He
was
a
savage!



There
was
no
warning.
He
just
kept
yelling
about
Over
and
over.
The
Night
Howlers.
So
you
know
about
the
Night
Howlers,
too?
Good.
Good,
good.
Because
the
Night
Howlers...
are
exactly
what
we
are
here
-
Right?
So,
uh,
so
you
just
open
the
door...
and
tell
us
what
you
know...
and
we
will
tell
you
what
we
know.
Okay?
Okay.
Clever
fox.


Mr.
Manchas?

Buddy?
Are
you...
okay?

Run.
Run!

What
is
wrong
with
him?
I
don't
know!

-
Jump!
-

Come
on!

-
Head
down!
Officer
Hopps
to
Dispatch.
Are
you
familiar
with
Gazelle,
of
our
lifetime,
-

Who's
that
beside
her?
Who
is
it?
Wow,
you
are
one
hot
dancer,

It's
me!
Did
you
think
it
was
real?
It
looks
so
real!
It's
not,
it's
just
a
new
app.
JUDY:
Clawhauser!
Clawhauser,
listen
to
me,
we
have
a

Jaguar

It's

CLAWHAUSER:
Okay,

There!
Head

Get

Carrots!
Go!

No,

Buddy.

One
predator

another...
No,
no,
no...
Now,
I
can
tell
you're
a
little
tense...
so
I'm
just
gonna
give
you

Rabbit,
whatever
you
do,
do
not
let
go!
-
I'm
gonna
let
go!
-
One,
two...
-
I
said,
do
not...
Rabbit!


Carrots.
You
saved
my
life.
Well.
That's
what
we
do
at
the
ZPD.






Hmm.
Well,
this
should
be
good.

JUDY:
I
thought
this
was
but
it's
way
bigger.
Mr.
Otterton
did
not
just
disappear.
I
believe
he
and
this
jaguar,
Savage?
This
isn't
the
Stone
Age,
Hopps.
Animals
don't
"go
savage."
I
thought
so,
too,
until
I
saw
this.
What?
He
was
right
here.
The
"savage"
jaguar?
Sir,
I
know
what
I
saw.
Or,
maybe
any
aggressive
predator...
looks
savage
to
you
rabbits.
Let's
go!
Wait,
sir.
I'm
not
the
only
one
who
saw
him.
-

Nick!
You
think
I'm
gonna
believe
a
fox?
Well,
he
was
a
key
witness,
and
I...
Two
days
to
find
the
otter...
or
you
quit.
That
was
the
deal.
Badge.
-

But,
sir,
we...
NICK:
Uh,
no.
What
did
you
say,
fox?
Sorry.
What
I
said
was,
"no."
She
will
not
be
giving
you
that
badge.
Look,
you
give
her
a
clown
vest...
and
a
three-wheeled
joke-mobile...
and
two
days
to
solve
a
case...
you
guys
haven't
cracked
in
two
weeks?
Yeah.
It's
no
wonder
she
needed
None
of
you
guys
-
Ho...
You
gave
her
the
48
hours...
so,
technically,
we
still
have...
10
left
to
find
our
Mr.
Otterton...
and
that
is
exactly
what
we're
gonna
do.
-

we
have
a
very
big
lead
Good
day.
Officer
Hopps.


Thank
you.
Never
let
them
see
that
they
get
to
you.
So...
things
do
get
to
you?
No,
I
mean,
not
anymore...
but
I
was
small...
and
emotionally
unbalanced
like
you
once.
Har-har.
No,
it's
true.
I
think
I
was
8,
or
maybe
9...
and
all
I
wanted
to
do...
was
join
the
Junior
Ranger
Scouts.
So,
my
mom
scraped
together
To
buy
me
a
brand-new
uniform...
because,
by
God,
I
was
gonna
fit
in.
Even
if
I
was
the

The
only

MEAN
KID
ANIMAL:
Okay,
Nick.
NICK:
I
was
gonna
be
part
of
a

Ready
for
initiation?
Yeah.
Pretty
much
born
ready.
I
was
so
proud.
MEAN

ANIMAL:
Okay.
Now,
raise
your
right
paw
I,
Nicholas
Wilde,
promise
to
be
brave...
loyal,
helpful,
and
trustworthy.
Even
though
you're
a
fox?
What?

No.
No!
What
did
I
do
wrong,
you
guys?
No,
please!
Tell
me!
What
did
I
do
wrong?

What
did
I

-
No...
If
you

NICK:
I
learned
two
things
that
day,
One...
I
was
never
gonna
let
anyone
And
two?
If
the
world's
only
gonna
see
a
fox...
as
shifty
and
untrustworthy...
there's
no
point
in
trying
Nick,
you
are
so
much
more
than
that.
Boy,
look
at
that
traffic
down
there.
How
about
we
go
out
to
Chuck
Chuck,
how
are
things
looking
Nick,
I'm
glad
you
told
me.
The
Jam
Cams.
-
Seriously.
It's
okay.
There
are
traffic
cameras
everywhere!
All
over
the
canopy!
Whatever
happened
to
that
jaguar...
The
traffic
cams
would
have
caught
it!
-
Bingo!
Pretty
sneaky,
slick!
However,
if
you
didn't
have
I
doubt
Chief
Buffalo
Butt
No.
But
I
have
a
friend
Sir,
if
we
could
just
review
-
Sir...
I'm
so
sorry.
Sir!
Okay.
I
heard
you,
Bellwether.
Please.
And
clear
No,
no!
But,
sir,
you
do
have
a
meeting...
with
Herds
and
Grazing.
Sir,
if
I
could
just...

Oh,
mutton
chops.
Assistant
Mayor
Bellwether?
We
need
your
help.
JUDY:
We
just
need

into


So
fluffy!
Hey!
Sheep
never
let
me
get
this
close.
You
can't
just
touch
a

wool!
It's
like
cotton
candy.
Stop
it!
Where
to?
Uh,
Rainforest
District,
Vine
and
Tujunga.
BELLWETHER:
There!
Traffic
Oh,
this
is
so
exciting,
I
never
get

this
important.
But
you're

Oh,
I'm
more
of
a
glorified

I

But
he
did
give
me
that
nice
mug.
JUDY:
Oh.
BELLWETHER:
Hmm.

Feels
good
to
be
appreciated.
LIONHEART:
Smell-wether!
Ugh.
That's
a
fun
little

I
called
him
Lion-fart
once.
He
did
not
care
for
that.
it
was
not
a
good
day
for
me.
Yes,
sir?
I
thought
you
were
going
Oh,

I
better
go.
Let
me
know
what
you
find.
It
was
really
nice
for
me
to
be...

Oh,

Okay,

Tujunga...
We're
in.

Who
are
these

Timberwolves.
Look
at

NICK:

a

-

What
is
it
with

Howlers.
Night
Howlers.
That's
what
Manchas
was
afraid
of!
Wolves!
The
wolves
are
the
Night
Howlers.
If
they
took
Manchas...
I'll
bet
they
took
Otterton,
too.
All
we
gotta
do
is
find
out

Wait,
where
did
they
go?
You
know,
if
I
wanted
because
I
was
doing
something
illegal...
which
I
never
have...
I
would
use
the
maintenance
tunnel
6B.
Which
would
put
them
out...
right
there.
Well,
look
at
you,
Junior
Detective.
You
know,

you'd
actually...
make

good

Ugh.

dare
you.

They're
heading
out

Where
does

You're
gonna
start
a

I
didn't
start
it!


Come

You

You

you.
You're

Hmm.

Okay,

Huh.
All

Hmm.
Great

Yes,

I

not
the
Zootopia
I
know
The
Zootopia
I
know
is
better
than
this.
We
don't
just
blindly
assign
blame.
We
don't
know
why
these
but
it
is
irresponsible...
to
label
all
predators
as
savages.
That's
not
my
Emmitt.
GAZELLE:
We
cannot
let
fear
divide
us.
Please
give
me
back
the
Zootopia
I
love.
Come
on,
Hopps.
The
new
mayor
wants
to
see
us.
The
mayor?
Why?
It
would
seem
you've
arrived.
Clawhauser?
What
are
you
doing?
Um...
They
thought
it
would
be
better...
if
a
predator
such
as
myself...
wasn't
the
first
face
that
you
see...
when
you
walk
into
the
ZPD.
What?
They're
gonna
move
me
to
records.
It's
downstairs.
It's
by
the
boiler.
Hopps!
JUDY:
Um,
I
don't
understand.
Our
city
is
90%
prey,
Judy...
and
right
now
they're
just
really
scared.
You're
a
hero
to
them.
They
trust
you.
And
so
that's
why
Chief
Bogo
and
I...
want
you
to
be
the
public
face
of
the
ZPD.
I'm...
not...
I'm
not
a
hero.
I
came
here
to
make
but
I
think
I
broke
it.
Don't
give
yourself
so
much
credit,
Hopps.
The
world
has
always
been
broken...
that's
why
we
need
good
cops.
Like
you.
With
all
due
respect,
sir,
a
good
cop...
is
supposed
to
serve
and
protect.
Help
the
city.
Not
tear
it
apart.

I
don't
deserve
this
badge.
Hopps...
Judy,
you've
worked
so
hard
to
get
here.
It's
what
you
wanted
since
you
were
a
kid.
You
can't
quit.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity.
A
dozen
carrots.
-
Thanks.
Come
on.
Hey,
there,
Jude.
Jude
the
dude.

Remember
that
one?
I'm
fine.
You
are
not
fine.
Your
ears
are
droopy.

Why
did
I
think
Because
you're
a
trier,
that's
why.
You've
always
been
a
trier.
Oh,
I
tried.
And
it
made
life
so
much
worse...
for
so
many
innocent
predators.
-

Speak
of
the
devil.
Right
on
time.
Is
that
Gideon
Grey?
Yep.
It
sure
is.
We
work
with
him
now.
He's
our
partner.
And
we
never
would
have
considered
it...
had
you
not
opened
our
minds.
That's
right.
I
mean,
Gid's
turned
into
one
of...
The
top
pastry
chefs
in
the
tri-burrows.
That's...
That's
really
cool,
you
guys.
Gideon
Grey.
I'll
be
darned.
Hey,
Judy.
I'd
just
like
for
the
way
I
behaved
in
my
youth.
I
had
a
lot
of
self-doubt,
in
the
form
of
unchecked
rage
I
was
a
major
jerk.
Oh,
I
know
a
thing
or
two
Anyhow,
I
brought
y'all
these
pies.

Hey,
kids,
don't
you
run
through...
that
midnicampum
holicithias.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa...
Well,
now,
there's
a
$4
word,
Mr.
H.
My
family
always
just
I'm
so...
What
did
you
say?
Oh,
Gid's
talking
about
I
use
them
to
keep
the
bugs
but
I
don't
like
the
little
on
account
of
what
happened
Yeah,
Terry
ate
one
whole
and
went
completely
nuts.
He
bit
the
dickens
out
of
your
mother.
A
bunny
can
go
savage.
Savage?
Well,
that's
a
strong
word.
But
it
did
hurt
like
the
devil.
Well,
sure
it
did!
There's
a
sizable
divot
in
your
arm.
I'd
call
that
savage.
Night
Howlers
aren't
wolves,
The
flowers
are
making

That's
it!
That's
what
I've
been
missing!
Oh,
keys!
Keys,
keys,
keys!
Hurry!
Come
on!
Oh!
Thank
you!
I
love
you!
Bye!

STU:
You
catch
any
of
that,
Bon?
Not
one
bit.
Oh,
that
makes
me
I
thought
she
was
talking

Who
is
it?
I
need
to
find
Nick.
Please.
Nick?
Nick!

Oh,
Nick.
Night
Howlers
aren't
wolves.
They're
toxic
flowers.
I
think
someone
is
targeting
and
making
them
go
savage!
Wow.
Isn't
that
interesting?
Wait...
Wait!
Listen...
I
know
you'll
never
forgive
me!
And
I
don't
blame
you.
I
wouldn't
forgive
me
either.
And
irresponsible
and
small-minded.
But
predators
shouldn't
suffer
I
have
to
fix
this.
But
I
can't
do
it
without
you.
And
after
we're
done...
you
can
hate
me.
And...

And
that'll
be
fine.
Because
I
was
a
horrible
friend...
and
I
hurt
you...
and
you
can
walk
away
knowing
I
really
am
just
a
dumb
bunny.

JUDY:
I
really
am
just
a
dumb
bunny,
I
really
am
just
a
dumb
bunny,
Don't
worry,
Carrots.
in
48
hours.


All
right.
Get
in
here.
Okay.
Oh,
you
bunnies.
-
There
we
go.
Deep
breath.
Are
you
just
trying
to
steal
the
pen?
Is
that
what
this
is?
You
are
standing
on
my
tail,
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Ooh,
I
thought
you
guys
only
grew
carrots.
Mmm.
What's
the
plan?
We
are
gonna
follow
the
Night
Howlers.
Okay.
How?
Know
this
guy?
Uh-huh.
I
told
you.
I
know
everybody.

Well,
hello.
Step
right
up.
All
your
favorite
movies!
I
got
movies
that
haven't
Hey,
15%
off!
20!
Well,
well,
look
who
it
is.
What's
it
to
you,
Wilde?
Shouldn't
you
be
melting
down
Hey,
if
it
isn't
Flopsy
the
Copsy.
We
both
know
those
weren't
moldy
onions...
I
caught
you
stealing.
What
were
you
gonna
do
with...
those
Night
Howlers,
Wezzleton?
It's
Weaselton!
Duke
Weaselton!
And
I
ain't
talking,
rabbit.
And
there
ain't
nothing
Ice
him.

You
dirty
rat!
Why
are
you
helping
her?
She's
a
cop!
And
the
godmother
I'm
gonna
name
her
Judy.
-
Oh!
Ice
this
weasel.

All
right,
all
right,
please!
I
stole
them
Night
Howlers
They
offered
me
what
I
couldn't
refuse.
Money.
And
to
whom
did
you
sell
them?
A
ram
named
Doug.
We
got
a
drop
spot
underground.
Just
watch
it.
Doug
is
the
opposite
of
friendly,
He's
unfriendly,

JUDY:

Come
on.
The
weasel
wasn't
lying.
Yeah,
looks
like
old
Doug's
cornered...
the
market
on
Night
Howlers.


You
got
Doug
here.
What's
the
mark?
Cheetah
in
Sahara
Square.
Got
it.
You
serious?
Yeah,
I
know
they're
fast.
I
can
hit
him.
Listen,
I
hit
a
tiny
little
otter...
through
the
open
window
of
a
moving
car.




DOUG:
Yeah,
I'll
buzz
you
when
it's
done.
Or
you'll
see
it
on
the
news.
You
know,
whichever
comes
first.

JESSE:
Hey,
Doug,
open
up!
All
right.
Woolter
and
Jesse
Out.

Hey.
Where
What
are
you
doing?
He's
gonna
see
you!
-

Whatever
you're
thinking,
Carrots!
DOUG:
It
better
have

JESSE:
Hey,
open
up!
What
are
you
doing?
We
need
to
get
this
evidence
to
the
ZPD!
Okay.
Great!
Here
it
is.
Got
it!
-
No.
All
of
it!
Oh,
great,
you're
a
conductor
now,
huh?
Hey,
listen.
It
would
take
a
miracle...
to
get
this
rust-bucket
going.

Well.
Hallelujah.
We
kinda
got
a
situation
at
the
lab.
-


NICK:
Mission
accomplished.
Would
it
be
premature
for
me...
to
do
a
little
victory
toot-toot?
All
right.
One
toot-toot.

Well,
I
can
cross
that


I
may
have
to
rescind

Maybe
that's
just
hail.
Come
here!

Back
off!
Oh!
-

Whoa!
Incoming!

Carrots!
Don't
stop!
Keep
going!
No,
no!
Please
stop!
Do
not
stop
this
car!




Whoa!
-
NICK:
Oh!


Speed
up,
Nick!
Speed
up!
There's
another
train
coming!
Trust
me.
Speed
up!

Stop
the
train!
-

Need
some
help?

NICK:
Oh,
no,
no,
no!
Too
fast!
Too
fast!
Hold
on!
Ahh!

I
think
this
is
our
stop!


Okay,
maybe
some
of
the
evidence
survived.
Oh!
Everything
is
gone.
We've
lost
it
all.
NICK:
Yeah...
Oh,
except
for
this.
-

Ow.
Come
on!
We
gotta
get
to
the
ZPD.
Cut
through
the
Natural
History
Museum!

There
it
is!
BELLWETHER:
Judy!
Judy!
Mayor
Bellwether!
We
found
out
what's
happening.
Someone's
darting
predators
with
a
serum.
That's
what's
making
them
go
savage.
I'm
so
proud
of
you,
Judy.
Thank
you,
ma'am.

How
did
you
know
where
to
find
us?
I'll
go
ahead
and
I'll
take
that
case
now.
Uh,
you
know
what?
I
think
Nick
and
I
will
just

BOTH:
Run.
Get
them.
Ahh!
Carrots!
-

Come
here,
come
here.
Okay,
now
just
relax.
Whoops...
Blueberry?
Pass.

BELLWETHER:
Come
on
out,
Judy.

Take
the
case.
Get
it
to
Bogo.
I'm
not
gonna
leave
you
I
can't
walk.
Just...
We'll
think
of
something.
BELLWETHER:
We're
on
the
same
team,
Judy.
Underestimated,
underappreciated.
Aren't
you
sick
of
it?
Predators.
They
may
be
strong
and
loud...
but
prey
outnumber
predators
10
to
1.

Think
of
it.
90%
of
the
population...
united
against
a
common
enemy.
We'll
be
unstoppable.

Huh?

Over
there!

Help!



Well,
you
should
have
just
stayed...
on
the
carrot
farm,
huh?
It
really
is
too
bad.
I...
I
did
like
you.
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Kill
me?

No,
of
course
not.
He
is.
-

Yes,
police!
There's
a
savage
fox...
in
the
Natural
History
Museum.
Officer
Hopps
is
down!
Please,
hurry.
No.
Nick,
don't
do
this.
Fight
it.
Oh,
but
he
can't
help
it,
can
he?
Since
preds
are
just
biologically...
predisposed
to
be
savages.




Gosh.
Think
of
the
headline!
"Hero
cop
killed
by
savage
fox."
So
that's
it?
Prey
fears
predator...
and
you
stay
in
power?
Yeah,
pretty
much.
It
won't
work!
Fear
always
works.
And
I'll
dart
every
predator...
in
Zootopia
to
keep
it
that
way.
-

Oh,
Nick.
No.

Bye-bye,
bunny.

Bleh...
Blood!
Blood!
Blood
and
death.
All
right,
you
know,
you're
milking
it.
Besides,
I
think
we
got
it.
We
got
it
up
there,
thank
you,
Yakety-yak!
You
laid
it
all
out
beautifully.
What?
Yeah...
Oh,
are
you
looking
for
the
serum?
Well,
it's
right
here.
What
you've
got
in
the
weapon
there?
Those
are
blueberries.

They
are
delicious.
You
should
try
some.

I
framed
Lionheart.
It's
my
word
against
yours.
-
Ooh,
actually...
BELLWETHER:
And
in
Zootopia
to
keep
it
that
way,
...it's
your
word
against
yours.
It's
called
a
hustle,
sweetheart.
Boom.

claiming
he

Did
I
falsely
imprison
those
animals?
Well,
yes.
Yes,
I
did.
It
was

kind
of

It

It

with
all
of
us.

All
right.
All
right,
enough!
Shut
it!
We
have
some
new
