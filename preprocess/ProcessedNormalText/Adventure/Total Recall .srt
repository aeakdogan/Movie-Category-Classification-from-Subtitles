You
never
thought
about
it,
just
a
little
bit?
I
don't
need
to
think
about
it.
Don't
mess
with
your
mind,
man.
It
ain't

All

Sorry,
who
are
you?
-
I'm
with
the
Cohaagen
administration.
Given
these
politically
charged
times,
shall
we
say,
loyalty
of
our
workers.
-
Yeah,
but
I
don't
work
for
you.
This
company
was
granted
and
we
are,
the
last

I
checked,
Okay,
I
see.
So
you
brought

We're

all
the

Oh,
really?
Who's
questioning

Who
gets
to

you?
Mr.
Quaid,
in
your
capacity
here,
you
are
privy
to

I
know
how
to
turn
'em
on,
We'd
like
you
to
sign
this.
And
what
is
that?
It
affirms
that
you
will
not
to
any
source,
either
foreign
or
domestic.
And
that
you
are
not
actively
engaged
in
any
attempt
to
overthrow
You
want
me
to
sign
something
The
document
merely
affirms
And
if
I
were
a
terrorist,
you
think
this
would
make
me
tell
you?
-
Is
that
your
guy's
big
plan?
You
catch
anyone
yet?
I
have

Lori
working
tonight?
Yeah.
Hey,
Murray.
Same.
You
ever
learn
how
to
play
the
piano?
Yeah,
I
always
wanted
What's
with
you
today?
What?
Yeah,
exactly.
You've
been
zoned
out
all
day.
I've
been
having
these
dreams.
Dreams?
Yeah,
feels
like
I'm
doing
something...
Something...
Something
that
matters,
Nope,
not
so
much.
You
don't
think
what
we
do
is
important?
Really?
Come
on,
Harry.
We
commute
halfway
for
shit
pay,
to
come
to
this

bar
-
No
offense,
Murray.
What?
Are
you
actually
happy
-
Why
the
hell
shouldn't
I
be?
Is
there
something
wrong
with
it?
No.
You
know
what?
You're
right.
Forget
it.
I'm
just...
Forget
it.
Who's
the
girl?
What
do
you
mean?
You
heard
me.
Who's
the
girl?
There's
no
girl.
It's
just
me.
Good.
'Cause
women
like
Lori
You're
a
lucky
man.
You're
living
the
dream,
my
friend.
-
Really?
-
I'm
living
the
dream?
All
right,
big
guy.
Tomorrow.
Hey.
My
advice?
Go
ahead.
Figure
out
a
way
to
deal
with
before
you
mess
your
shit
up
for
good.
It's
possible
I
might
have
drank
too
much.
Yeah,
it's
possible,
Harry.
I'm
going
to
go
throw
up
on
something
now.
-
Okay.
and
go
home
to
your
wife,
you
hear
me?
Yeah,
I
think
everyone
heard
you,
Harry.
Night,
Dougie.
Good
night.
Seem
like
you're
looking
for
something.
Is
it
this?
Anything
goes
here.
Trust
me,
baby,
I'm
looking
for
Rekall.
You
know
where
I
can
find
it?
Stairway
to
heaven,
over
there.
Sure
I
can't
change
your
mind?
I
bet.
Thank
you.
Welcome
to
Rekall.
First
time?
Yeah.
That
obvious,
huh?
It's
fine.
There's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
This
is
a
safe
place.
My
friend
Marek
gave
me
this
card,
-
He's
right
inside.
Remember
to
have
a
good
time.
Welcome.
Hey.
You're
a
friend
of
Marek's.
Yes.
Yeah,
we
work
together.
Is
that
it?
That
is
it.
And
it
feels
like
real
life?
What
is
life
but
our
brain's
Your
eyes
see,
your
brain
chemistry
reacts.
Here,
we
just
remove
the
middleman
Does
that
make
it
any
less
real?
An
illusion,
no
matter
how
convincing,
That's
very
good.
You're
right,
objectively.
But
from
the
inside,
subjectively...
I
assure
you,
it's
quite
the
opposite
entirely.
Listen,
I
get
it.
I
get
it.
You're
here
because
You
got
some
tug,
some
longing
We're
going
to
give
you
that
thing.
Is
that
right?
Could
be
something
Something
secret
you've
always
wanted
What
do
you
mean,
secret?
Anything.
Tell
us
your
fantasy.
You
want
to
be
rich
and
famous?
Worshiped
by
millions?
Maybe
something
Crime
fighter?
Or
world-class
athlete?
Secret
agent.
That's
you.
Right?
Clandestine
bank
accounts,
-coded
messages.
I
could
do
that.
Yeah,
as
an
intelligence
operative.
You
could
be
working
for
the
Resistance.
Maybe
you
work
for
Cohaagen.
Or
why
limit
yourself?
Why
not
both?
One
last
thing,
Doug.
As
a
matter
of
full
disclosure,
none
of
the
secret
life
elements
See,
the
thing
is,
a
lot
of
guys
come
in
here,
they
want
when
they
already
have
one,
We
can't
do
that.
It
would
cause
That's
how
brains
get
blown.
Don't
worry,
I
don't
have
any
secrets.
I'm
sure
you
don't,
but
just
in
case,
we're
going
to
run
Marcus,
go.
You're
going
to
have
such
a
good
time,
you're
not
going
to
want
to
come
back.
Look
at
that.
Looks
like
your
wife
No
conflict
there.
Sorry.
Still
the
best
way
All
right.
Let's
get
this
show
on
the
road.
Get
ready
to
save
the
world.
Happy
trails,
man.
You
can
tell
me
all
about
it
when
you
get...
Wait.
What?
Shit.
Shit?
What
is
it?
What's
wrong?
Yank
that
needle
out
before
it
takes.
What
is
it?
What's
wrong?
-
You
lied.
-
Son
of
a
bitch.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
You're
a
goddamn
spy.
Vitals
are
everywhere.
Why
are
you
here?
Why?
Federal
police!
-
Federal
police!
On
your
feet
now!
This
is
all
a
mistake!
It's
all...
I'm
nobody.
-
I'm
nobody.
Okay.
Turn
around!
Okay.
Holy
shit.

Go!
Move,
move,
move!
Federal
police!
Team

have
you
secured
the
suspect?
Team
one,
advise.
Stevens,
get
an
eyeball
in
there
now.
Shit.
They're
all
down.
He's
all
alone!
Let's
punch
it.
Fall
back!
Fall
back!
Cover
the
exit!
In
what
is
being
described
as
a
terrorist
attack,
on
a
squadron
of
federal
police
We
are
still
awaiting
word
-on
precisely
how
many
casualties
there
are.
-
But
officials
now
confirming...
...that
at
least
20
officers
have
been
killed...
Oh,
my
God,
Doug.
I
understand.
Yeah.
-
Thank
you.
-
I'm
so
glad
you're
here.
I've
been
going
out
of
my
mind.
Where
have
you
been?
Look,
something
bad
has
happened.
No,
I
know.
I
just
got
the
call.
We've
all
been
put
on
standby.
You
don't
understand.
What?
Oh,
my
God.
Doug,
are
you
okay?
Lori,
it
wasn't
the
Resistance
It
wasn't
terrorists.
It
was
me.
What
was
you?
Lori,
I'm
the
one
who
killed
them.
You
killed
20
armed
men?
No.
No,
it
was
more
like
ten.
But
you
killed
them?
With
what,
honey,
your
book?
-
Lori,
look,
I'm
serious.
I'm
sorry.
This
is
going
to
sound
crazy,
okay?
I
went
to
Rekall
after
work.
-
And.
..
-
What
did
they
do
to
you?
Nothing.
Before
they
could
do
anything,
They
tried
to
take
me.
And
I
just
reacted.
And
I
killed
them.
Listen,
you
didn't
kill
anyone,
Doug.
Trust
me,
I
killed
everyone.
No,
sweetheart,
don't
you
see?
Whatever
you
think
you
did
Those
assholes
screwed
with
your
mind,
and
now
you're
having
some
Those
places
are
really
dangerous.
Whatever
it
is
that
happened,
Come
here.
Come
on.
Come
on.
It
happened
so
fast.
It's
okay,
we'll
figure
it
out.
I'm
sorry.
Lori,
I
can't
breathe.
Come
on.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Lori,
what
the
fuck...
Lori,
what
the...
Lori,
goddamn
it,
what
are
you
doing?
My
Job.
Are
you
crazy?
Am
I
crazy?
That's
a
good
one,
Doug.
Considering
you
don't
even
know
Do
you
really
believe
an
entire
room
of
highly-trained
men?
Tell
me
what
is
going
on.
Talk!
Or
we
can
skip
straight
to
I'm
not
your
wife.
That's
bullshit.
I'm
U.F.B.
police
intel,
Six
weeks
ago,
I
didn't
even
know
you.
What
are
you
talking
about?
It's
true.
Your
memory
was
erased,
with
a
life
you
think
you've
lived.
You
keeping
up,
baby?
There
is
no
Douglas
Quaid,
there
never
was.
Are
you
saying
I
don't...
This...
Every...
Our
marriage...
What
can
I
say?
I
give
good
wife.
Come
on.
Deep
down,
did
you
really
believe
someone
like
me
live
in
this
shithole?
If
I'm
not
me,
then
who
the
hell
am
I?
How
would
I
know?
I
just
work
here.
Speculate.
If
I
had
to
guess,
all
the
trouble
Cohaagen's
taken
you
must
be
fairly
important.
And
with
your
skill
set,
I
think
it's
highly
Cohaa...
Cohaagen's
trying
to
hide
me?
Why
are
you
trying
to
kill
me?
Talk!
Call
it
seven-year
itch,
Doug.
And
by
the
way,
you
haven't
even
No!
Shit.
Team
three,
break

I
need
you
on-site
now.

Hello.
It's

I
don't
know
any

Oh,

You
said
this
might
happen.
Look,

a
piece

Put
your
hand
to

Do
it
now.
Oh,
Jesus.

are
you?
You
honestly
don't
remember
No.
No,
I
don't.
Remember
what?
How
do
you
know
me?
We
worked
at
federal
intel
together.
Look,
there
isn't
much
time.
You
said
to
me
I
was
to
phone
this
number.
The
grid?
Your
phone.
It's
been
reactivated.
How
do
you
think
Look,
you
asked
me
to
give
you
a
message,
so
I'm
giving
it
to
you.
Get
the
key.
The
key?
What
is
the
key?
You
said
you'd
know.
Yeah,
well,
I
don't!
So
tell
me
what
it
is.
Look,
I
know
we
were
close,
but
this
is
getting
too
dangerous.
If
they
find
out
I've
contacted
you,
I'll
be...
Just...
Just
tell
me
what's
going
on.
All
right,
who
is
it
you
think
I
am?
Henry.
Henry,
okay,
good.
Henry,
who?
Look,
there
isn't
any
time.
If
I
were
you,
I'd
get
rid
of
that
phone.
-
All
right?
Now.
It's
in
my
goddamn
hand.
How
am
I...
Hey,
wait.
10549.
10549.
Come
on.
Holy
shit.
What
is
that?
Where
can
I
get
one?
-
What
the
hell?
Hey,
Robo-dick,
that's
mine!
Going
somewhere?
No?
Well,
don't
let
that
stop
you.
That
fantasy
that
remains
Not
anymore.
At
Rekall,
we'll
provide
you
with
Rekall.
We
can
remember
it
for
you.
Come
inside!
We
have
hot
food
for
you.
Quaid
must've
known
we'd
be
tracking
it.
How
the
hell
would
he
have
known
that?
Oh,
shit.
He
made
you
look
like
a
fool.
He'd
had
major
tactical
training,
sir.
I
wasn't
made
aware
of
that.
How
the
hell
did
he
get
activated?
An
agent
in

I
sent
a
team
in,
but

I'm
15
minutes
behind
him.

do
you
understand
me?
No

force.
I
want
him
alive
for
re-implantation.
Who
the

is
this
guy,
sir?
Take
me
off

Line
is
secure.
Are
you
fucking
kidding
me?
Why
is
he

alive?
Yes,
sir.

kill

I'm
SOFTY,
say
again?
-
Sorry.
on
the
ground.
Believe
me,

that
target's

If
you
see
him,
you
shoot

Is
that
understood?
I
keep
telling
you,
that's
my
phone.
The
guy
gave
it
to
me,
I
swear.
Where
was
he
going?
Who?
The
man
that
gave
it
to
you.
Lady,
do
I
look
like
a
psychic?
All
I'm
saying
is
that
phone
I
know
my
rights,
so
you
all
can
just...
Hey!
When
you've
got
your
breath
back,
you're
going
to
tell
me
everything
that
man
said
to
you,
Who
are
you?
I'm
his
wife.
Okay.
You're
good.
Can
I
help
you,
sir?
Yeah,
I
have
a

there
a

No.
No

any
one
of

And
I'll
just
be
outside,
if
you
need
me.
Thanks.
Okay.
They're
gonna
be
so
I
need
to
make
this
quick.

going

This
message
is
being
recorded
in
the
event
of
a
worst-case
scenario.
I'm
sure
you're
desperate
for
answers,
My
name...
Your
name
is
Carl
Hauser.
Oh,
shit.
This
recording
has
limited
So,
just
try
rephrasing
the
question.
You
work
with
Matthias.
Yes
and
no.
I've
never
actually
met
the
man.
Hardly
anyone
has.
Look,
I
know
that
this
is
complicated.
-
Complicated?
I
am
a
Federal
Intelligence
operative
assigned
by
Cohaagen
to
infiltrate
the
Resistance
But
instead,
I
discovered
I
met
a
woman
She
works
with
the
Resistance.
And
she
showed
me
You
mean
the
terrorists.
Listen,
the
Resistance
are
not
terrorists.
All
right.
Matthias'
targets
are
always
If
there's
anything
else
happening,
you
can
be
sure
it's
Cohaagen
himself.
Trust
me,
all
right.
The
Chancellor
and
I
go
way
back.
He
was
my
commanding
officer
in
the
war.
I
know
exactly
what
he
is
capable
of.
Why
would
he
attack
his
own
people?
How
else
could
he
justify
tripling
He
is
building
a
private
army
Think
about
it.
All
right.
What
is
the
one
resource
The
Colony
has
-
S
pace.
He's
run
out
of
room.
But
even
Cohaagen
himself
selling
the
forced
seizure
So,
he
created
an
enemy
in
Matthias,
and
he
built
an
army
to
fight
him.
And
now
it
is
up
to
me
to
stop
him.
Up
to
you
to
stop
him.
What
do
you
mean,
me?
The
synthetics
run
on
a
bio-mech
brainstem.
All
right.
Which
means,
it's
possible
All
right,
there's
a
kill
code.
It's
a
complex
sequence,
but
it's
in
my
head,
it's
in
your
head.
Sorry,
come
again.
I
went
back
to
U.
F.B.
territory
to
try
and
retrieve
the
code,
knowing
full
well
that
if
Cohaagen
he'd
erase
my
memory.
But
what
he
didn't
know
was
that
imbedded
in
my
brain,
in
your
brain.
It
recorded
everything
I
saw.
So,
you're
saying
Yes.
And
that
is
why
I
need
you.
The
world
needs
you,
Deliver
the
code
to
Matthias,
have
him
shut
down
the
synthetics
The
future
hangs
on
what
you...
On
what
we
do
next.
Good
luck,
buddy.
You
have
got
to
be
kidding
me.
This
can't
be
happening.
Shouldn't
have
come
here.
Yeah,
I
know.
I
had
no
choice.
I
know
that
this
is
a
lot
to
take.
Yeah,
it's
a
lot
to
take.
Yeah,
I'm
supposed
to
believe
this?
It's
the
truth.
Hauser,
we
have
been
looking
for
you.
Don't
call
me...
My
name
is
Doug
Quaid.
All
right,
I
was
raised
by
my
mother.
She
died
of
cancer
ten
days
I
married
my
girlfriend
when
I
was
29!
You
were
born
April
29th.
You
were
raised
by
your
father,
He
died
before
you
were
15,
And
believe
me,
you
were
I'm
sorry.
You
know
what?
I'm
Doug
Quaid,
that's
all
I
know.
You
recognized
me.
From
a
dream.
I
recognize
you
from
a
dream.
It
wasn't
a
dream.
It
was
a
memory.
That
scar
on
your
hand,
Do
you
know?
I
got
it
at
work.
I
was
trying
to
help
you
escape,
You
grabbed
onto
me
and
a
bullet
tore
through
You
must
remember
something.
And
you
and
I,
we
were...
Yeah.
We
got
to
go.
We
got
to
go.
Shit.
Come
on,
come
on.
Doug!
Harry?
Harry,
what
are
you
doing
here?
They
sent
me
in
for
you.
To
talk
you
down.
Who
sent
you
in?
Doug,
you
don't
get
it.
I
mean,
they
sent
me
into
your
mind.
I
need
you
to
listen
to
me.
You're
suffering
what's
called
Brought
on
by
the
trauma
What
are
you
talking
about?
You're
not
really
here,
Doug.
You're
still
back
at
Rekall,
None
of
this
is
real.
Back
at
Rekall?
He's
lying.
He's
lying!
Just
slow
down.
Harry,
what
are
you
talking
about?
When
we
were
back
at
the
bar,
And
by
the
time
I
got
here,
it
was
too
late.
You
were
unresponsive.
So
they
chemically
They
thought
a
familiar
face
might
before
it's
too
late
and
you're
trapped
here
forever.
Do
not
listen
to
them.
They're
just
trying
Doug,
I
assure
you.
This
is
not
the
Harry
that
you
know.
Think...
Does
he
even
sound
like
himself?
He
is
a
plant,
just
like
your
wife,
I
don't
sound
like
me,
Doug,
What
do
you
mean,
"I
don't
want
you
to"?
You
need
to
realize,
The
rest
is
supplied
Even
the
explanation
It's
really
you.
It's
really
you.
Your
mind
is
choosing
the
words.
Because
that's
where
we
are,
Doug.
We
must
get
you
out
before
it's
too
late,
If
this
is
all
in
my
mind,
why
are
you
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest?
Because
you
put
it
on
me.
-
I
put
it
on
you?
Explain
that
to
me,
how
do
I
put
this
on
you?
He's
crazy.
Part
of
you
wants
to
protect
me.
To
let
me
guide
you
back
to
consciousness
before
your
psychosis
that
you
slip
into
a
permanent
coma.
To
convince
you
to
free
yourself.
Hauser...
I
am
real.
He
is
real.
He
works
for
Cohaagen.
Lori?
-
What's
she
doing
here?
What's
she
doing
here?
She's
in
the
room,
beside
you,
holding
your
hand
right
now,
worried
sick.
It's
her
presence
you're
sensing.
She's...
She's
trying
to
kill
me!
-
No.
Not
the
real
Lori,
Doug.
As
soon
as
I
told
her
what
was
happening
at
I
had
to
call
her
at
work.
She
loves
you,
Doug.
Lori
didn't
work
last
night,
Harry.
You're
lying.
You're
lying.
Why
are
you
lying
to
me?
Only
because
you
wanted
me
to.
You're
clinging
to
the
delusion.
He's
lying!
Harry?
Harry.
I
swear
to
God,
put
it
down.
Harry,
what
are
you
doing?
Harry,
what
are
you
doing?
This
is
not
a
delusion!
No?
Okay,
fine.
Tell
you
what.
Is
that
proof
enough
for
you?
Would
I
have
done
that
if
this
were
for
real?
You
see,
I'm
not
afraid,
Doug.
You
shouldn't
be
either.
That's
enough
of
this
bullshit.
or
I
swear
to
God
I'm
gonna
kill
you.
Don't...
Don't.
Hauser...
He's
trying
to
manipulate
you
-
We
got
to
get
out
of
here.
There's
no
getting
But
you
can
escape
this
nightmare
Help
me
how?
-
Don't
listen
to
him.
Don't
listen
to
him.
You
have
to
shoot
her,
Doug.
What,
now?
I
know
that's
asking
a
lot,
but
she's
at
the
epicenter
of
this
whole
twisted
fantasy
of
yours.
She
represents
all
your
frustration,
-
Hauser...
it
would
mean
nothing
if
we
were
to
kill
her.
It's
you
who
has
to
choose
reality.
You
shoot
her,
Doug,
and
I
promise
you,
you
will
gasp
awake
The
real
me.
-
No.
Look
at
me.
Turn,
and
you'll
see
your
beautiful,
loving
wife.
She
wants
you
back,
Doug.
We
both
do.
That's
right,
Doug.
Come
on
back.
Come
on
back,
Doug.
I
can't
let
them
take
you
away.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
so
sorry.
Of
course
she
can't
do
it.
She's
not
real.
Now
you
just
need
to
prove
it
to
yourself.
End
her,
Doug.
End
this
nightmare.
Shoot
her!
Kill
her,
damn
it!
Shoot!
Jesus
Christ.
God
damn
it,
Harry!
-
Are
you
okay?
Come
on.
You
still
out
there,
baby?
Or
I
suppose
I
should
be
calling
you
Hauser.
I
guess
the
joke's
on
me.
I
really
thought
you
were
a
loser.
Turns
out,
I
was
living
with
Cohaagen
still
wants
you
back,
you
know.
Guess
he
still
has
faith
in
you.
But
then
you
always
were
the
favorite.
But
I
know
what
you
are.
You're
a
traitor,
Hauser.
And
traitors
get
put
to
death!
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on.
So
you
might
want
to
give
Long
as
she
doesn't
mind
Oh,
that's
it,
I'm
ending
this
bitch.
Shit,
I'm
out.
Come
on!
Come
on!
Go!
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Come
on.
Shit.
Go!
There.
Oh,
shit.
Come

Give
me
the

Track
him.
Grab
my

this

down?
No?
Level
D-14.
Shit.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Wait,
wait.
Go!
You
really
know
how
to
pick
'em.
Come
on.

Of
course
you
don't
remember
that.
That's
good
to
know.

You

Yeah,
I'm...
Everyone
seems
to
know
me,
but
me.
It's
strange.
Yeah.
I
can
see
he
meant
a
lot
to
these

Yeah.
He
gave
us

if

is

I'm
sorry.
Hauser
wasn't
perfect,
you
know.
Could
be
a
real
asshole
sometimes.
You're
just
trying
to
make
me
feel
better.
Maybe.
It's
working.
Clear.
He
wants
to
see
him
alone.
Don't
go
too
far.
Okay.
Mr.
Hauser.
What
is
it
you
want?
I
want
to
help
you.
That
is
not
the
only
reason
you're
here.
I
want
to
remember.
Why?
So
I
can
be
myself,
be
who
I
was.
It
is
each
man's
quest
but
the
answer
to
that
lies
in
the
present,
not
in
the
past.
As
it
is
for
all
of
us.
But
the
past
tells
us
who
we've
become.
The
past
is
a
construct
of
the
mind.
It
blinds
us.
It
fools
us
into
believing
it.
But
the
heart
wants
to
live
in
the
present.
Look
there.
You'll
find
your
answer.
I
am
told
you
have
information
I
am
told

same.

see?

you

What
is
this?
Hello,
Matthias.
You
can't
imagine
how
much
I've
been
looking
forward
It's
been
far
too
long.
You
know,
you're
a
very
hard
man
to
find.
-
It's
a
trap.
Secure
all
entrances!
Move!
Move!
Go,
go,
go!
Get
him
out
of
here!
Gun
down
now!
Now!
Well
done.
It's
impressive.
You'll
be
interested
to
know
that
there
is
no
kill
code.
It
was
a
fake.
You're
lying.
Sorry.
It
was
the
only
way
to
get
to
you.
All
this
trouble
for
one
man.
Oh,
never
underestimate
I
know
I
don't.
Father!
No!
No!
We
knew
this
day
would
come.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
so
sorry.
No.
Melina!

Lieutenant?
Matthias'
defensive
plans,
troop
numbers
and
location
coordinates
on
every
Resistance
outpost
in
The
Colony.
The
first
wave
of
attack
is
already
underway.
Brilliant.
Congratulations,
my
friend.
Up,
up,
Up.
YOU
did
it.
You're
a
hero.
What
is
that?
Modesty?
No,
no,
no.
Matthias
is
dead,
The
Colony
is
about
to
fall,
and
it's
all
thanks
to
you.
I
knew
that
I
could
trust
you
What
are
you
talking
about?
Right.
Yours
is
not
It
was
really
rather
simple.
Infiltrate
the
resistance,
-
No.
No.
That's
right.
Once
we
discovered
he
was
your
father,
we
knew
exactly
who
to
target.
Melina,
he's
lying.
I'm
afraid
not.
Because
seduction
has
always
been
Still,
it
was
Matthias
that
we
needed
to
get
to.
He
would
need
assurance
to
let
a
man
with
your
history,
shall
I
say,
come
anywhere
near
him.
But
that
is
when
you
came
up
to
feign
capture
Don't
listen
to
him.
It
was
just
brilliant.
What
better
way
to
convince
the
old
man
that
you
had
really
and
truly
turned
against
me.
Melina,
don't
listen
to
him.
-
He's
lying.
Granted,
there
were
a
few
hiccups
along
the
way...
You
popping
your
cap
at
Rekall,
for
instance.
That
wasn't
good.
There
it
is!
The
old
Hauser
spirit.
And
then
there
was
your
lovely
wife,
who
strayed
from
her
directive.
Look
at
me.
She
was
ordered
to
bring
you
back
alive.
I'll
deal
with
that
later.
But,
you
led
us
here,
Hauser.
You
held
up
your
part
of
the
deal,
and
now
I'm
going
to
hold
up
mine.
What
do
you
mean?
-
No.
What
are
you...
What
are
you
doing?
What
you
and
I
had
been
planning
all
along.
We
made
sure
to
back
up
Hauser's
memory
before
we
sent
him
in
there.
This
is
what
you
wanted.
-
No.
Just
think
of
it.
In
a
few
hours,
you'll
awake,
and
you
will
be
the
old
Hauser
once
again.
Loyal
Patriotic.
Ruthless.
Now,
what
to
do
with
you?
I
think
we
keep
her.
Leave
her
out
of
this.
I
think
the
world
will
be
very
interested
to
hear
the
confession
of
Matthias'
daughter.
Denouncing
her
father
and
the
Resistance.
FUCK
you!
Cohaagen!
You'll
be
very
surprised
a
confession
out
of
someone.
God
damn
you,
Cohaagen.
You
have
me.
Let
her
go.
Let
her
go!
Melina.
Just
try
to
relax.
We'll
be
reunited
very
soon.
And
meanwhile,
I
have
an
invasion
to
lead.
I
wish
I
could
forget
that
easily.
Lori.
Sweet
dreams.
Hold
him
still,
Hammond.
Do
me
a
favor,
asshole.
Fight
it
as
much
as
possible.
Hurts
more
that
way.
Jesus,
Hammond.
