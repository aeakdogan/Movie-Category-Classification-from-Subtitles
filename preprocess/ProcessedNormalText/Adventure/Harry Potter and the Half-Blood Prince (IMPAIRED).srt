Well,
I
don't
understand.
This
is
perhaps
the
most
important
It
is
also
a
lie.
This
memory
has
been
tampered
with...
...by
the
same
person
whose
memory
it
is,
But
why
would
he
tamper
-I
suspect
he's
ashamed
of
it.
Why,
indeed?.
I

I

I

across
something
rather

...where
no
one
will
ever
find
it,

-What
was
that?.

See?.
You
never
know
what
you'll
find
up
here.
All
right,
close
your
eyes.
Close
your
eyes.
That
can
stay
hidden
up
here
too,
So
did
you
and
Ginny
do
it,
then?.
What?.
You
know,
hide
the
book?.
oh,
yeah.
Ah.
Dear,
yes.
Still
no
luck
with
Slughorn,
then,
Luck.
That's
it.
All
I
need's
a
bit
of
luck.
HERMIONE:
Excellent.
Really
excellent.
Remember...
...Slughorn
usually
eats
early...
...takes
a
walk,
Right.
-I'm
going
down
to
Hagrid's.
No,
Harry,
you've
got
to
go
-We
have
a
plan.
...but
I've
got
a
I
feel
it's
the
place
to
be
tonight.
-No.
or
Felix
does.
Hi!

Merlin's
beard,
Harry!
Sorry,
sir.
I
should've
announced
myself.
You
probably
feared
Yes,
I
did,
actually.
Well,
just
the
general
behavior,
sir.
The
sneaking
around,
Are
those
T
entacula
leaves,
sir?.
Ten
Galleons
a
leaf
to
the
right
buyer.
Not
that
I'm
familiar
with
any
such
My
own
interests
Personally,
these

SLUGHORN:
HARRY:
I'm
off
to
Hagrid's.
...and
I
fancied
paying
him
a
visit.
So
if
you
don't
mind,
Harry!
-Sir?.
Surely
you
realize
I
can't
allow
you
Well,
then,
by
all
means,
come
along,
sir.
SLUGHORN:
Harry,
I
must
insist
...back
to
the
castle
immediately!
HARRY:
And
what
makes
you
say
that?.
No
idea.
Horace.
Merlin's
beard.
A
dead
one,
I
think,
sir.
Good
God.
Dear
fellow,
Kill
it?.
Me
oldest
friend,
he
was.
-I'm
so
sorry,
I
didn't--
Seriously
misunderstood
creatures,
It's
the
eyes,
I
reckon.
Not
to
mention
the
pincers.

Yeah,
I
reckon
that
too.
Hagrid,
the
last
thing
...but
Acromantular
venom
Would
you
allow
me
Purely
for
academic
purposes,
Well,
I
don't

it's
going

you
know.
I
wish
you
could've
seen
him
Magnificent,
he
was.
Just
magnificent.
oh,
dear.
-Would
you
like
me
to
say
a
few
words?.
He
had
a
family,
I
trust?.
oh,
yeah.
Farewell....
Aragog.
Farewell,
Aragog...
...king
of
the
arachnids.
Your
body
will
decay...
...but
your
spirit
lingers
on.
And
your
human
friends
find
solace

I
had
him
from
an
egg,
you
know.
No
bigger
than
a
Pekinese.
How
sweet.
I
once
had
a
fish.
Francis.
one
afternoon
I
came
downstairs,
Poof.
-That's
very
odd,
isn't
it?.
But
that's
life,
I
suppose.
You
go
along
and
then
suddenly,
poof!
-Poof.

It
was
a
student
who
gave
me
Francis.
one
spring
afternoon
...with
just
a
few
inches
And
floating
on
the
surface
As
I
watched,
it
sank.
Just
before
it
reached
the
bottom...
...it
transformed...
...into
a
wee
fish.
It
was
beautiful
magic.
Wondrous
to
behold.
The
flower
petal
had
come
from
a
lily.
Your
mother.
The
day
I
came
downstairs...
...the
day
the
bowl
was
empty...
...was
the
day
your
mother....
I
know
why
you're
here.
But
I
can't
help
you.
It
would
ruin
me.
Do
you
know
why
I
survived,
professor?.
The
night
I
got
this?.
Because
of
her.
Because
she
sacrificed
herself.
Because
she
refused
to
step
aside.
Because
her
love
was
more
powerful
-Don't
say
his
name.
I'm
going
to
tell
you
something.
Something
others
have
only
guessed
at.
It's
true.
I
am
the
Chosen
One.
only
I
can
destroy
him,
...I
need
to
know
what
T

...and
I
need
to
know
what
you
told
him.
Be
brave,
professor.
Be
brave
like
my
mother.
otherwise,
you
disgrace
her.
otherwise,
she
died
for
nothing.

Please,
don't
think
badly
of
me
You've
no
idea
what
he
was
like,
RIDDLE:
...in
the
Restricted
Section...
...and
I
read
something
rather
odd
It's
called,
as
I
understand
it...
...a
Horcrux.
-I
beg
your
pardon?.
I
came
across
the
term
while
reading...
...and
I
didn't
fully
understand
it.
I'm
not
sure
what
you
...but
this
is
very
dark
stuff,
Which
is...
...why
I
came
to
you.
A
Horcrux
is
an
object
in
which
a
person
But
I
don't
understand
one

one's
soul
and
hides

That
part
of

soul
In
other
words,
you

And
how
does
one
split

soul,
sir?.
SLUGHORN:
I
think
you
already
know
Murder.
Yes.
Killing

the

apart.
RIDDLE:
Can

Isn't
it
bad
enough
T

into
seven
pieces....
This
is
all
hypothetical,
isn't
it,
T

of
course,
sir.
It'll
be
our
little
secret.
HARRY:
This
is
beyond
anything
I
imagined.
You
mean
to
say
he
succeeded,
sir,
oh,
yes,
he
succeeded,
all
right.
What
are
they
exactly?.
Could
be
anything.
A
ring,
for
example.
or
a
book.
-T

Riddle's
diary.
Four
years
ago,
when
you
saved
...in
the
Chamber
of
Secrets,
I
knew
this
was
Very
dark,
very
powerful.
But
until
tonight
-The
ring?.
Difficult
to
find.
But
if
you
could
find
them
all,
one
destroys
Voldemort.
But
how
would
you
find
them?.
True.
But
magic,
especially
dark
magic...
...leaves
traces.
It's
where
you've
been
going,
-When
you
leave
the
school?.
And
I
think
perhaps
But
this
time,
once
again,
SNAPE:
Have
you
ever
considered
...that
you
take
too
much
for
granted?.
Has
it
ever
crossed
your
brilliant
mind
Whether
it
has
or
hasn't
is
irrelevant.
I
will
not
negotiate
with
you,
Severus.
oh,
Harry.
You
need
a
shave,
my
friend.
You
know,
at
times,
At
times,
I
still
see
the
small
boy
Forgive
my
mawkishness,
Harry.
I'm
an
old
man.
You
still
look
the
same
to
me,
sir.
Just
like
your
mother,
A
trait
people
never
fail
to
undervalue,
The
place
to
which
we
journey
tonight
I
promised
you
could
accompany
me,
But
there
is
one
condition:
You
must
obey
every
command
Yes,
sir.
You
do
understand
what
I'm
saying?.
Should
I
tell
you
to
hide,
you
hide.
Should
I
tell
you
to
run,
you
run.
Should
I
tell
you
to
abandon
me
Your
word,
Harry.
My
word.
Take
my
arm.
Sir,
I
thought
you
couldn't
Well,
being
me
has
its
privileges.
DUMBLEDORE:
oh,
yes.
This
place
has
known
magic.
-Sir!
...payment
must
be
made.
Payment
intended
-You
should've
let
me,
sir.
Your
blood's
much
more
precious
Voldemort
will
not
have
made
it
easy
He
will
have
put
certain
defenses
Careful.
There
it
is.
The
only
question
is,
If
you
would,
Harry.
Do
you
think
the
Horcrux
is
in
there,
sir?.
oh,
yes.
It
has
to
be
drunk.
All
of
it
has
to
be
drunk.
You
remember
the
conditions
on
which
This
potion
might
paralyze
me.
Might
make
me
forget
why
I'm
here.
Might
cause
me
so
much
pain
You
are
not
to
indulge
these
requests.
It's
your
job,
Harry,
to
make
sure
Even
if
you
have
to
force
it
-Understood?.
Because
I
am
much
older,
much
cleverer,
Your
good
health,
Harry.
Professor.
Professor!

Harry.
HARRY:
Professor.
No.
Don't.
You
have
to
keep
drinking,
DUMBLEDORE:
Stop.
-...but
only
if
you
keep
drinking.
-I'm
sorry,
sir.
-Kill
me.
Kill
me!
DUMBLEDORE:
It's
all
my
fault.
It's
my
fault.
HARRY:
Just
one
more,
sir.
...I
promise
I'll
do
what
you
say.
-I
promise.
Please.
Harry.
Water.
Water.
Water.
You
did
it,
sir.
Look.
Harry.
Water.
Aguamenti.
DUMBLEDORE:
Lumos.

Lumos

DUMBLEDORE:
Sectumsempra!
Harry.
-Stupefy!
DUMBLEDORE:
Partis

Go
to
your
houses.
No

We
need
to
get
you
to
the
hospital
No.
Severus.
Severus
is
who
I
need.
Wake
him.
Tell
him
what
happened.
Speak
to
no

Severus,
Harry.

Hide
yourself

Harry.
Don't

Whatever
happens,
Harry,
do
as
I
say.

Trust
me.
Trust
me.
Good
evening,
Draco.
What
brings
you
here
Who
else
is
here?.
I
heard
you
talking.
DUMBLEDORE:
I
often
talk
aloud
to
Have
you
been
whispering
Draco...
-...you
are
no
assassin.
I've
done
things
that
would
shock
you.
Like
cursing

DUMBLEDORE:

You're
not

There
are
others.
How?.
The

-I've

it.
It

A

In
Borgin
and
Burkes.
DUMBLEDORE:
Draco...
...years
ago,
I
knew
a
boy
-Please
let
me
help
you.
Don't
you
understand?.
I
have
to
do
this.
I
have
to
kill
you.
or
he's
gonna
kill
me.
Well,
look
what
we
have
here.
Well
done,
Draco.
DUMBLEDORE:
I
think

BELLATRIX:
Love

AIbus,

I'm
afraid
Do
it.
GREYBACK:
He
doesn't
have
the
stomach,
Let
me
finish
him
in
my
own
way.
BELLATRIX:
No!
The
Dark
Lord
was
clear,
This
is
your
moment.
Do
it.
Go
on,
Draco.
Now!

DUMBLEDORE:
Please.

Yeah!
BELLATRIX:

HARRY:
No,

I

I'll
let

sometimes,
you
can
