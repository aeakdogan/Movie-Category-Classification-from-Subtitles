Booth
with

There's

to

You

the

No,
it's
a
cipher

the
Lincoln
That's
not
true.
Do
you
know
-
Yes.
Of
course.
-
You
know
the
origin
of
the
expression?
Dr.
Samuel
Mudd
was
convicted
in
the
Lincoln
assassination.
He
was
later
pardoned,
Mudd's
name
still
lives
in
infamy.
And

Ben.
Look
at
this.

See
that?
-
That's
quite
something,
isn't
it?
lt's
nothing.

The
letters
are
backwards.

a

A
cipher.

what
we're
going
to

Only
one
way
to
prove
it.
You've

Let's
hear
the
story
again
Grandpa
heard
his
father
say,
-
Then
there
was
a
commotion.
Anything
he
said,
-
Wait
a
minute.
He
took
his
son's
hand.
He
looked
him
in
the
eye,
and
he
said,
-
''The
debt
that
all
men
pay.''
The
debt
that
Thomas
paid.
That's
five
letters.
Oh!
Try
''Death.''
-
What?
The
debt
that
all
men
pay
is
death.
All
right.

interest

especially.

General
Albert
Pike.
But,
then
again,
what
is
history
but
A
man
only
has
one
lifetime,
So
the
only
question
is,
Exactly.
ls
there
more
than
one?
There
are
three,

glad

Laboulaye

leave
a
clue

Let
me
get
there.
No.
Believe
me,

understand.

Excuse
me,
officer.
May

help
you?
