JACK:
Earth,
before
the
war.
New
York,
before
I
was
born.
A
place
I've
only
I
know
you...
But
we've
never
met.
I'm
with
you...
But
I
don't
know
your
name.
I
know
I'm
dreaming.
But
it
It
feels
like
a
memory.
How
can
that
be?
March
14th,
2077.
Five
years
since
And
I'm
still
haunted
Victoria
and
I
were
In
two
weeks,
our
mission
here
will
be
But
the
questions
I
ask,
The
things
I
wonder
about,
It's
been
half
a
century
since
the
Forced
to
leave
their
own
dying
Without
the
moon,
the
Earth
Earthquakes
toppled
Tsunamis
wiped
Then
came
the
invasion.
We
did
what
we
had
to
do.
We
used
the
nukes.
We
won
the
war,
Left
it
contaminated.
What
remained
of
humanity
We
built
the
Tet,
A
temporary
space
station
Saturn's
largest
moon.
Everyone's
there
now.
Well,
almost
everyone.
Until
our
tour
is
complete,
We
protect
the
hydro
rigs,
which
convert
Earth's
sea
water
into
fusion
energy
The
survival
of
humanity

Thank
you
for
the
coffee.
Remnants
of

They
attack

in
them,

done
well.
That
we
are

It's

I
don't

were
The

They
were
trying

Well,

Come

her.
I
know,
it's
tragic.
Jack,
we
want
to
bring
you
in.
I've
been
we're
going
to
You
and
the
survivor.
There's
a
lot
of
interest
up
here.
We
can
debrief,
It's
time
to
come
home,
Jack.
Jack?
Jack?
Jack...
I'm
sorry.
Hang
on.
Lightning.
That's
the
plan.
We
need
cover.
There.

Are
you
okay?

Don't
worry,

Are
we
gonna
die?
No!
Maybe.
Jack!
Son
of
a
bitch.
Wait
here.

Who
is
it?
Hey!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey!
Drop
your
weapon!
It's
okay.
Don't
move!

We
have
to
shut
Stop
moving!
JULIA:
Jack!






It's
okay.


Julia.
Julia!

Don't.
Don't
touch
me.
Hold
on.
Just
hold
on.
Jack
Harper,
Tech-52.
Hey.
There
you
are.
What
happened?
That
bogey
came
across
the
False
alarm.

I
should
get
back
out
there.
You
come
all
the
way
home,

What's
going
on
up
there?
I
was
thinking...
Why
don't
you
To
the
surface?
We
could
go
right
now.

Now?
Yeah.
Are
you
serious?
You
won't
believe
Jack...
You
know
the
regulations.
Yes.
Can
we
not
do
this
again?
Okay.
This
is
gonna
hurt.


Hell

huh,
Bob?

Those

are

Jack.
They're
ours.
They
are
you.

Good

We'll

Promise
me.
We'll
come
back
when
it's

You
had
me
worried
I
thought
you
Well,
I
had
to
prove
him
wrong.
You
look
like

You
should
see
the

Another

But
in

You
picked
it
up.
You
studied
it.
And
I
thought
I
saw
a

When
you
stepped
in

knew.
You
were
in

somewhere.
I
just
had
to
find

Watch

Give
it
some

I'm
okay.
The

Send
the

It's

I
thought

had

I
really
did.
I

myself.

No.

Jack,
JACK:
I
don't
know
what
you
but
I'd
like
to
tell
you
A
story
from
Rome,
a
city
you
destroyed.
It's
a
classic.
There
was
a
guy,
Horatius,
held
the
bridge
alone
And
what
Horatius
said
was,
"How
can
a
man
die
better..."
You
don't
have
to
die,
Jack.
Everybody
dies,
Sally.
The
thing
is,
to
die
well.
Jack,
that's
not
No,
it's
not.
What
Horatius
said
was,
"How
can
a
man
die
better"
JACK:
"Than
facing
fearful
odds"
Drones!
JACK:
"For
the
ashes
of
his
fathers"
"And
the
temples
of
his
Gods"
SALLY:
I
created
you,
Jack.
I
am
your
God.
Fuck
you,
Sally.
JACK:
Earth,
after
the
war.
Three
years
have
passed
I
wonder
if
I
come
to
In
the
day,
as
memories.
Do
I
haunt
your
hours
And
I
wonder
if
you
see
me
when
you
look
at
her.
Mommy,
look.
If
we
have
souls,
they
are
Undimmed
by
time.
Unbound
by
death.
For
three
years,
I
searched
I
knew
it
had
to
be
out
there.
Because
I
know
him.
I
am
him.
Who's
that?
I
am
Jack
Harper.
And
I
am
home.
