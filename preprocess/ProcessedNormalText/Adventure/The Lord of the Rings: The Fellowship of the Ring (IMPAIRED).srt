I
feel
it
in
the
water.
I
feel
it
in
the
earth.
I
smell
it
in
the
air.
Much
that
once
was...
...is
lost.
For
none
now
live
who
remember
it.
It
began
with
the
forging
Three
were
given
to
the
Elves.:
Immortal,
wisest
and
fairest
Seven
to
the
Dwarf-lords.:
Great
miners
and
craftsmen
And
nine...
...nine
rings
were
gifted
...
who,
above
all
else,
desire
power.
For
within
these
rings
was
bound
But
they
were
all
of
them
deceived.
For
another
ring
was
made.
In
the
land
of
Mordor,
...
the
Dark
Lord
Sauron
forged
...
to
control
all
others.
And
into
this
Ring
he
poured
...and
his
will
to
dominate
all
life.
One
Ring
to
rule
them
all.
One
by
one...
...
the
Free
Lands
of
Middle-earth
But
there
were
some
who
resisted.
A
Last
Alliance
of
Men
and
Elves
And
on
the
slopes
of
Mount
Doom,
they

Victory
was
near.
But
the
power
of
the
Ring...
...could
not
be
undone.
It
was
in
this
moment...
...
when
all
hope
had
faded...
...
that
Isildur,
son
of
the
king,
Sauron,
the
enemy
of
the
Free
Peoples
The
Ring
passed
to
Isildur...
...
who
had
this
one
chance
But
the
hearts
of
Men...
...are
easily
corrupted.
And
the
Ring
of
Power
It
betrayed
Isildur...
...
to
his
death.
And
some
things
...
were
lost.
History
became
legend...
...legend
became
myth.
And
for
...
the
Ring
passed
Until,
when
chance
came...
...it
ensnared
a
new
bearer.
GOLLUM:

The

there
it

For
500

it
poisoned

And
in
the
gloom

Gollum's

Darkness
crept
back
Rumor
grew
of
a
shadow
in
the
East...
And
the
Ring
of
Power
perceived...
...its
time
had
now
come.
It
abandoned
Gollum.

something

It

Back
Again.:
A
Hobbit's
Tale.
By
Bilbo

Now...
...where
to
begin?
Ah,
yes....
"Concerning...
...Hobbits."
Hobbits
have
been
living
and
farming
...for
many
hundreds
of
years...
...quite
content
to
ignore
...by
the
world
of
the
Big

Middle-earth

all,

must
seem
...being
neither
renowned
...nor
counted

very
wise.

Frodo!
Someone
at
the
door.
In
fact,
it
has
been
remarked
by
some...
...
that
Hobbits'
only
real
passion
A
rather
unfair
observation...
...as
we
have
also
developed
a
keen
...and
the
smoking
of
pipe-weed.
But
where
our
hearts
truly
lie...
...is
in
peace
and
quiet...
...and
good,
tilled
earth.
For
all
Hobbits
share
a
love
And,
yes,
no
doubt
to
others,
But
today
of
all
days,
It
is
no
bad
thing

Frodo,
the

Where
is
that
boy?
Frodo!

Now
far

the

has
gone

A

is
never

Frodo

Nor
is
he
early.
He

It's
wonderful
to
see
you,
Gandalf!
You
didn't
think
I'd
miss
How
is
the
old
rascal?
I
hear
it's
going
to
be
a
party
You
know
Bilbo.
Well,
that
should
please
him.
Half
the
Shire's
been
invited.
And
the
rest
of
them
are
turning
up
BILBO:
...
very
much
as
it
has

of
its
own
comings
and
goings,
If
it
comes
at
all.
For

are
made
to
endure
...passing
from
one
generation
There's
always
been
a

And
there
always
will
be.
To
tell
you
the
truth,
I
mean,
more
than
usual.
He's
taken
to
locking
himself
He
spends
hours
poring
over
old
maps
Where's
it
gone?
He's
up
to
something.
-What?
But
I
know
you
have
something
Good
gracious
me.
Before
you
came
along,
we

Indeed.
Never
had
any

If
you're
referring
to

We
don't
want
any
more
visitors,
And
what
about
very
old
friends?
Gandalf?
-Bilbo
Baggins.
Good
to
see
you.
111
years
old!
You
haven't
aged
a
day.
Come
on,
come
in!
Welcome,
welcome.
Oh,
here
we
are.
Tea?
Or
maybe
something
I've
got
a
few
bottles
Very
good
year.
Almost
as
old
as
I
am.
It
was
laid
down
by
my
father.
Just
tea,
thank
you.
Oh!
I
was
expecting
you
sometime
Not
that
it
matters.
You
come
and
go
as
You
caught
me
a
bit
unprepared.
We've
only
There's
some
cheese
here.
We've
got
raspberry

But
not
much

I've
just
found
some

cake.
I
could
make
you
some
eggs
-Just
tea,
thank
you.
-You
don't
mind
if
I
eat,
do
you?

FEMALE
HOBBIT:
I'm
not
at
home!
It's
the
Sackville-Bagginses.
-I
know
you're
in
there!
They've
never
forgiven
me
I've
got
to
get
away
from
these
confounded
...never
giving
me
a
moment's
peace.
I
want
to
see
mountains
again.
And
then
find
somewhere
quiet
-So
you
mean
to
go
through
with
your
plan?
All
the
arrangements
are
made.
Oh,
thank
you.
Frodo
suspects
something.
Of
course
he
does.
He's
a
Baggins...
...not
some
blockheaded
Bracegirdle
You
will
tell
him,
won't
you?
-Yes,
yes.
I
know.
He'd
probably
come
with
me
I
think
in
his
heart,
Frodo's
The
woods,
the
fields.
Little
rivers.
I
am
old,
Gandalf.
I
know
I
don't
look
it,
but
I'm
I
feel
thin.
Sort
of
stretched...
...like
butter
scraped
I
need
a
holiday.
A
very
long
holiday.
And
I
don't
expect
I
shall
return.
In
fact,
I
mean
not
to.
Old
Toby.
The
finest

Ah.
Gandalf,
my
old
friend...
...this
will
be
a
night
to
remember.


BILBO:
Fatty
Bolger.
Lovely
to
see
you.
Go
on,
Sam.
Ask
Rosie
for
a
dance.
-I
think
I'll
just
have
another
ale.
Go
on!
So
there
I
was...
...at
the
mercy
And
they
were
all
arguing
...about
how
they
were
Whether
it
be
turned
on
a
spit,
or
to
sit
They
spent
so
much
time
arguing
...that
the
sun's

light
...and
turned
them
all
to
stone!

MERR

Whoa!
Up
they
go!
No,

Mrs.
Bracegirdle,
how
nice
to
see
you.
Are
all

yours?
Good
gracious,
FEMALE
HOBBIT:
Sackville-Bagginses!
Quickly,
hide!
Thank
you,
my
boy.
You're
a
good
lad,
Frodo.
I'm
very
selfish,
you
know.
Yes,
I
am.
Very
selfish.
I
don't
know
why
I
took
you
in
...but
it
wasn't
out
of
charity.
I
think
it
was
because...
...of
all
my
numerous
relations...
...you
were
the
one
Baggins
Bilbo,
have
you
been
No.
Well,
yes,
but
that's
not
the
point.
The
point
is,
Frodo...
...you'll
be
all
right.
-Done!
-It
is
in
the
ground.
This
was
your
idea.
Bilbo.
Bilbo,
watch
out
for
the
dragon!
Nonsense.
There
hasn't
been
a
dragon
-That
was
good.

I

less

uh--
I
have
things
to
do.
I've
put
this
off
far
too
long.
I
regret
to
announce
this
is
the
end!
I'm
going
now.
I
bid
you
all
a
very
fond
farewell.
Goodbye.



I
suppose
you
think
Come
on,
Gandalf.
There
are
many
magic
rings
in
this
world,
It
was
just
a
bit
of
fun.
Oh,
you're
probably
right,
as
usual.
-You
will
keep
an
eye
on
Frodo,
won't
you?
As
often
as
I
can
spare
them.
-I'm
leaving
everything
to
him.
-Is
that
staying
too?
It's
in
an
envelope
over
there
No.
Wait,
it's...
...here
in
my
pocket.
Isn't
that--?
Isn't
that
odd,
now?
Yet,
after
all,
why
not?
-Why
shouldn't
I
keep
it?
Is
that
so
hard?
Well,
no.
And
yes.
Now
it
comes
to
it,
It's
mine.
I
found
it!
It
came
to
me!
-There's
no
need
to
get
angry.
It's
mine.
My
own.
-My
precious.
It's
been
called
that
before,
What
business
is
it
of
yours
I
think
you've
had
that
ring
-You
want
it
for
yourself!
Do
not
take
me
for
some
conjurer
I
am
not
trying
to
rob
you.
I'm
trying
to
help
you.

All
your
long
years,
Trust
me
as
you
once
did.
Let
it
go.
You're
right,
Gandalf.
The
ring
must
go
to
Frodo.
It's
late.
The
road
is
long.
Yes,
it
is
time.
-Bilbo.
The
ring
is
still
in
your
pocket.
Ah.
Yes.
I've
thought
up
an
ending
for
my
book:
"And
he
lived
happily
ever
after
And
I'm
sure
you
will,
my
dear
friend.
Goodbye,
Gandalf.
Goodbye,
dear
Bilbo.
BILBO:
Until
our
next
meeting.

My

Riddles

the
dark.
Bilbo!
Bilbo!
My
precious.
Precious.
He's
gone,
hasn't
he?
He
talked
for
so
long
about
leaving...
...I
didn't
think
he'd
really
do
it.
Gandalf?
Bilbo's
ring.
He's
gone
to
stay
with
the
Elves.
He's
left
you
Bag
End.
Along
with
all
his
possessions.
The
ring
is
yours
now.
-Put
it
somewhere
out
of
sight.
-There
are
some
things
that
I
must
see
to.
-Questions.
Questions
that
need
answering.
I
don't
understand.
Neither
do
I.
Keep
it
secret.
Keep
it
safe.

Ah.

Hold

Can

Nothing.
There's

I
dare
not
take
it.
Not
even
to
keep
it
safe.
Understand,
Frodo...
...I
would
use
this
Ring
But
through
me,
it
would
wield
a
power
-But
it
cannot
stay
in
the
Shire!
No,
it
can't.
What
must
I
do?
-You
must
leave.

leave
quickly.
Get

creatures.
You
can

all
that
there
is

And
yet,
after

can
still
surprise
you.

Get
down.

Confound
it

I
haven't
been

Honest.
A
little
late
for
trimming
the

heard
raised

Nothing

That
is,
I
heard
a
good
deal
about
a
ring,
Please,
Mr.
Gandalf,
sir,
don't
hurt
me.
No?
Perhaps
not.
I've
thought
of
a
better
use
for
you.
GANDALF:
Be
careful,
both
of

has

Is
it
safe?
Never

it
on...

Always
remember,

is
trying
to
get
back
It
wants
to
be
found.

This
is
it.
This
is
what?
If
I
take
one
more
step...
...it'll
be
the
farthest
away
Come
on,

Remember
what

Smoke
rises
The
hour
grows
late.
And
Gandalf
the
Grey
...seeking
my
counsel.
For
that
is
why
you
have
come,
My
old
friend.
Saruman.
SARUMAN:
You
are
sure
of
this?
So
the
Ring
of
Power
has
been
found.
All
these
long
years,
-Under
my
very
nose.
Your
love
of
the
halfling's
leaf
But
we
still
have
time.
Time
enough
Time?
What
time
do
you
think
we
have?
Sauron
has
regained
He
cannot
yet
take
physical
form...
...but
his
spirit
has
lost
Concealed
within
his
fortress,
His
gaze
pierces
cloud,
shadow,
You
know
of
what
I
speak,
Gandalf.
A
Great
Eye,
lidless,
The
Eye
of
Sauron.
He
is
gathering
all
evil
to
him.
Very
soon,
he'll
have
You
know
this?
How?
I
have
seen
it.
A
palantir
is
a
dangerous
tool,
Why?
Why
should
we
fear
to
use
it?
They
are
not
all
accounted
for,
We
do
not
know
who
else
The
hour
is
later
than
you
think.
Sauron's
forces
are
already
moving.
The
Nine
have
left
Minas
Morgul.
The
Nine?
They
crossed
the
River
Isen
...disguised
as
riders
in
black.
-They've
reached
the
Shire?
And
kill
the
one
who
carries
it.
Frodo!
You
did
not
seriously
think
that
a
Hobbit
There
are
none
who
can.
Against
the
power
of
Mordor...
...there
can
be
no
victory.
We
must
join
with
him,
Gandalf.
We
must
join
with
Sauron.
It
would
be
wise,
my
friend.
Tell
me...

you

aiding
me
willingly...

Frodo?
Frodo!
-I
thought
I'd
lost
you.

Gandalf
said.
"Don't

lose
him,
Samwise
Gamgee."
Sam,
we're
still
in
the
Shire.
Frodo.

it's

Get
off

Come
on,

FRODO:

MAGGOT:
Get

And

before.

clearly
overreacting.
Run!
Oh,

close.
I
think
I've
broken
something.
Trust

What?
That

That's
nice,

MERRY:
I

we
should
get

Get

Quick!

Be
quiet!

What

Nothing.
What

Elderly

Not

SAURON:
I
see
you.
There
is
no
life...
...in
the
void.
Only...
...death.
You
draw
far
too
much
attention
What
do
you
want?
A
little
more
caution
from
you.
-I
carry
nothing.
I
can
avoid
being
seen
if
I
wish...
...but
to
disappear
entirely,

are
you?
Yes.
Not

frightened
enough.

Let

You

heart,
little
Hobbit.
You

They're
coming.


What
are
they?
They
were

Men.
Great

of
Men.
Then
Sauron
the
Deceiver
gave

them
Blinded

their
greed,
One

one,
falling
into
darkness.
Now
they
are
slaves
to
his
will.
They
are
the
Nazgul.
Ringwraiths.
Neither
living
nor
dead.
At
all
times
they
feel...

the
presence
of
the
Ring...
...drawn
to
the
power
of
the
One.
FRODO:
Where
are
you
taking
us?
How
do
we
know
this
Strider
I
think
a
servant
of
the
enemy
-...and
feel
fouler.
We
have
no
choice
but
to
trust
him.
-But
where
is
he
leading
us?
-To
the
house
of
Elrond.
We're
going
to
see
the
Elves.

-Gentlemen,

not
stop
till
nightfall.
-You've
already
had

Don't

do.
The

Rip

around.
Stay

Look,

Mr.

He's

Give

No.
No!

no.

Not

too.
A

more
hours

you
But
you

some
strength
in
you,
What
happened,
Gandalf?
-Why
didn't
you
meet
us?
I
was
delayed.
A
friendship
with
Saruman
One
ill
turn
deserves
another.
Embrace

embrace
your

destruction!
GANDALF:
Only
one

can
bend
it
to
his
will.
And
he
does
not
share
power.

So
you
have
chosen
death.
Gandalf?
What
is
it?
Nothing,
Frodo.
SAM:
Frodo!
-Sam.
Sam
has
hardly
left
your
side.
We
were
that
worried
about
you.
By
the
skills
of
Lord
Elrond,
Welcome
to
Rivendell,
Frodo
Baggins.

Bilbo!
Bilbo.

is
wonderful.

at

But
age,

pretending
Off
with
you,
But
my
own
adventure
turned
out
I'm
not
like
you,
Bilbo.
My
dear
boy.
SAM:
Now,
what
have
I
forgotten?
No
harm
in
being
prepared.
-I
thought
you
wanted
to
see
the
Elves.
-More
than
anything.
It's
just....
We
did
what
Gandalf
wanted,
didn't
we?
We
got
the
Ring
this
far,
...seeing
as
how
you're
on
the
mend,
Off
home.
You
are
right,
Sam.
We
did
what
we
set
out
to
do.
The
Ring
will
be
safe
in
Rivendell.
I
am
ready
to
go
home.
ELROND:
That
wound
will
never
fully
heal.
And
yet
to
have
come
so
far
...the
Hobbit
has
shown
extraordinary
It
is
a
burden
he
should
never
-We
can
ask
no
more
of
Frodo.
Sauron's
forces
are
massing
in
the
East.
And
Saruman,
you
tell
me,
has
betrayed
us.
Our
list
of
allies
grows
thin.
His
treachery
runs
deeper
By
foul
craft,
Saruman
He's
breeding
an
army
An
army
that
can
move
in
sunlight
Saruman
is
coming
for
the
Ring.
This
evil
cannot
be
concealed
We
do
not
have
the
strength
Gandalf...
...the
Ring
cannot
stay
here.
ELROND:
This
peril
belongs
They
must
decide
now
how
to
end
it.
The
time
of
the
Elves
is
over.
Who
will
you
look
to
when
we've
gone?
They
hide
in
mountains
seeking
riches.
It
is
in
Men
Men?
Men
are
weak.
The
blood
of
Numenor
is
all
but
spent,
It
is
because
of
Men
I
was
there,
Gandalf.
I
was
there
3000
years
ago...
...
when
Isildur
took
the
Ring.
I
was
there
the
day
Isildur,
hurry!
Follow
me.
ELROND:
I
led
Isildur
into
the
heart
...
where
the
Ring
was
forged,
Cast
it
into
the
fire!
[VOICE
OF
THE
RING
-Destroy
it!
Isildur!
ELROND:
It
should
have
ended
that
day,
Isildur
kept
the
Ring.
There's
no
strength
left
-They're
scattered,
divided,
leaderless.
One
who
could
reclaim
He
turned
from
that
path
He
has
chosen
exile.
You
are
no
Elf.
Men
of
the
South
are
welcome
here.
-Who
are
you?
Then
we
are
here
on
common
purpose...

The
shards
of
Narsil.
The
blade
that
cut
the
Ring
It's
still
sharp.
But
no
more
than
a
broken
heirloom.
Why
do
you
fear
the
past?
You
are
Isildur's
heir,
You
are
not
bound
to
his
fate.
The
same
blood
flows
in
my
veins.
The
same
weakness.
Your
time
will
come.
You
will
face
the
same
evil.

thought
I
had
strayed
into

Long
years
have
passed.
You
did
not
have
the
cares
you
carry
now.
Do
you
remember
what
I
told
you?
You
said
you'd
bind
yourself
to
me...
...forsaking
the
immortal
life
And
to
that
I
hold.
I
would
rather
share
...than
face
all
the
Ages
I
choose
a
mortal
life.
-You
cannot
give
me
this.

my
heart.
ELROND:
Strangers
from
distant
lands,
...you've
been
summoned
here
Middle-earth
stands
upon
the
brink
You
will
unite,
or
you
will
fall.
Each
race
is
bound
to
this
fate,
Bring
forth
the
Ring,
Frodo.
So
it
is
true.
In
a
dream...
...I
saw
the
eastern
sky
grow
dark...
...but
in
the
West
A
voice
was
crying:
"Your
doom
is
near
at
hand.
Isildur's

is
found."
Isildur's
Bane.
Boromir!
