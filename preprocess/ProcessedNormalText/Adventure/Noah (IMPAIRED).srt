NOAH:
Ham.
What
are
you
doing?
It's
pretty.
You
see
those
other
flowers?
How
they're
attached
That's
where
they
should
be.
They
have
a
purpose.
They
sprout.
And
they
bloom.
The

takes
their
seeds

Do
you
understand?
Shem.
Ham.
Let's
go.


Men.
Hide,

Go.



POACHER:
You
found
our
kill.
How
fortunate.
But
for
you...
maybe
not.

You
know
how
long
it
is
Since
we
even
saw
an
animal?
Easy.



Please.
What
do
you
want?

Justice.
Why
did
they
kill
it?
They
eat
them.
Why?
They
think
it
makes
them
stronger.
Is
it
true?
They
forget
strength
comes
from
The
Creator.
YOUNG
SHEM:
Mama!

Mommy!

See
your
brothers?


Ham
saw
men
hunting
today.
They
are
getting
closer.
How
was
he?
A
little
too
interested.
Hmm.
He
had
to
see
it
sometime.
I
saw
something
else.
A
flower
bloom
from
nothing.
Rest.
Perhaps
He
will
finally


Methuselah.





NAAMEH:
Did
He
speak
to
you?
NOAH:
I
think
so.
NAAMEH:
Will
He
help
us?
He's
going
to
destroy
the
world.
NAAMEH:
It's
a

dangerous

How

YOUNG
HAM:
Shem.
We
could
take
the
boys
There'll
be
no
hiding.
We
should
have
left
already.

let
me
Push
it
in
here.
Next
time
we
come
through,
we'll
know

There
are

ahead.
NOAH:
We
will

close.
YOUNG
HAM:
Is
that
a

mine?
NOAH:
It
was
once.
Should
we
go
around?

No.
Do
you
think
they're
all
dead?
It
looks
that
way.
They

Let

Tell

You

go.
Now.

NOAH:
Up
the

Run.
NAAMEH:
We
can't
go

NOAH:
We
have
no
choice.

MAN
1:

Hold,

Hold!

3:
They'll
kill
you!
NOAH:

Protect
your

I
love
you.
Run!

NAAMEH:



NAAMEH:
Noah!
Noah.
Noah.

We
are
to
see
Methuselah.
A
child
of
the
old
one?
You
should
have
killed
them.
OG:
-
But,
Samyaza...
Do
you
forget
how
It
is
He
who
sends
us!

SAMYAZA:
It
lies!
Leave
them
here
to
rot.
What
are
they?
The
Watchers.

YOUNG
ILA:
Dada?

Sleep
now.
Sing
to
me.
I
want
my
daddy
to
sing
to
me.
You
know,
I,
too,
lost
my
father
when
I
was
very
young.
There's
a
song
he
used
when
I
couldn't
sleep.
Would
you
like
to
hear
it?
The
moon
is
high
The
trees
entwine
Your
Father
waits
for
thee
To
wrap
you
in
And
whisper
you
to
sleep
Your
Father
is
The
healing
wind
That
whispers
you
to
sleep
That
whispers
as
you
sleep
NAAMEH:
It's
an
ugly
wound.
She'll
never
have
children.
If
the
fever
doesn't
take
her,
I
think
she'll
live.



Follow
me.
I'm
sorry
I
frightened
you.
Watchers
have
learned
YOUNG
HAM:
Then
why
The
Creator
formed
us
The
day
He
made
the
heavens.
We
watched
over
Adam
and
Eve.
Saw
their
frailty
and
their
love.
And
then
we
saw
their
fall.
We
were
not
stone
then,
It
was
not
our
place
Yet
we
chose
to
try
And
when
we
disobeyed

He
punished
us.
We
were
encrusted
by
your
world.
Rock
and
mud
Still,
we
taught
mankind
With
our
help
they
rose
from
the
dust,
But
then
they
turned
Only
one
man
protected
us.
Your
grandfather
Methuselah.

We
were
hunted.


Those
who
lived
marooned
upon
this
barren
land.
We
begged
The
Creator
But
He
was
always
silent.
And
now
you
claim
that
you
have
Samyaza
cannot
accept
this.
A
man?
When
it
is
men
But
I
look
at
you
and
I
see
a
glimmer
The
man
I
knew.
The
man
I
came
to
help.
YOUNG
HAM:
Why
can't
I
come?
Because
I
need
you
Do
you
understand?

And
you
Watch
over
them.
They
are
in
good
hands.
Grandfather?
METHUSELAH:
Noah.
This
is
your
great-grandfather.
Show
him
respect.
Tell
him
your
name.
I
am
Shem.
My
eldest.
Come
closer.
Let
me
see
you.
You're
a
lucky
boy.
I
think
you
must
have
not
your
father's.
Come
tell
me
about
yourself.
So,
what
do
you
like
Berries.
-
What?
Ah,
berries,
yes.
What
can
compete
with
Yes,
it's
been
so
long
remember
the
taste
of
them.
Ah,
tell
me,
No?
Oh.
I'm
craving
them
now.
Ah,
well,
perhaps
one
day.
You
must
be
tired.
Yeah.
Why
not
rest?

How
perfect.
What
we
need
to
discuss
You
know
why
I've
come?
Yes.
Before
he
walked
on,
my
father
Enoch
told
me
if
man
continued
in
his
ways,
The
Creator
would
So
what
I
saw
is
true?
All
life
blotted
out
Can
it
not
be
averted?
Noah,
you
must
trust
that
you
can
understand.
So
you
tell
me.
Can
this
destruction
be
averted?
No.
Oh.
He
sent
me
here.
Why
send
me
if
there's
Well,
perhaps
He
simply
sends
with
an
old
man.
So,
is
that
all
you
saw?
The
fires
of
destruction
No,
not
fire.
Water.
Water?
Huh.
My
father
said
it
would
be
fire.
I
saw
water.
I
saw
death.
And
I
saw
new
life.
There's
something
more,
Grandfather.
Something
I'm
to
do.
I
know
it.
I
just
didn't
see
what
it
was.
New
life.
Well,
perhaps
there
is
Did
He
not
send
you
here
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
The
medicine
always
tastes
bad.
YOUNG
SHEM:
She
was

Was
she
hurt
badly?

Well?
Fire
consumes
all.
Water
cleanses.
It
separates
the
foul
The
wicked
from
the
innocent.
And
that
which
sinks
He
destroys
all,
but
only
to
start
again.
You
sure?
Yes.
The
storm
cannot
be
stopped.
But
it
can
be
survived.
Yeah.
You
may
need
this.
It's
a
seed.
From
the
first
Garden.
From
Eden.
Remember,
Noah,
He
chose
you
for
a
reason.

YOUNG
HAM:
You
can't
get
me!
Oh,
you
can't
get
me!
Dada!

NOAH:
My
grandfather
lives.
He's
helped
me
see
Men
are
going
to
be
punished
for
what
they've
done
There
will
be
destruction.
There
will
be
tragedy.
And
our
family
has
been
We've
been
chosen
The
innocent?
The
animals.
Why
are
they
innocent?
Because
they
still
live
Yes.
And
we
need
to
save
enough
But
what
of
us?

I
guess
we
get
We
get
to
start
again
But
first
we
have
to
build.
Build
what?

NOAH:
A
great
flood
is
coming.
The
waters
of
the
heavens
will
meet
the
waters
We
build
a
vessel
We
build
an
ark.

SAMYAZA:
Take
the
traitor
back.
OG:
He
is
a
child

Stop!
There
is
work
to
do.
Help
you?
We
tried
to
help
your
kind
once.
And
we
lost
everything
Not
everything.
We
can
save
what
is
left.
You
treacherous
snake!
The
Creator.



NAAMEH:
Children!
What
is
this?
This...
This
is
our
ark.
We
will
help
this
man.



No!


Shem.
Wait.
Please.
It
still
hurts?

-
Ham!
He
doesn't
have
anyone.

SHEM:
Come.

Father,
did
you
see
them?
Father?
Yes,
Japheth.
It
begins.



Ready?

NOAH:
It
sleeps.

Gently.
See,
that's
a
boy
one
After
the
storm,
they'll
become
a
mother
And
the
hatchlings
will
spread
We
have
to
be
gentle
with
them
If
something
were
to
happen,
that
would
be
a
small
piece
All
of
these
innocent
creatures
are
now
in
our
care.
It's
our
job
to
look
after
them.
HAM:
Father?
All
the
birds
are
two.
You
have
Mother,
Shem
has
Ila.

But
what
of
me?
What
of
Japheth?
Who
is
there
for
us?
Did
you
see
how
He
made
the
forest
to
give
us
wood
for
the
ark?
How
He
sent
the
birds?
So,
hasn't
He
sent
JAPHETH:
Mother!
What
is
it?
What?
Snakes!
-
Snakes
are
coming,
too?
All
that
creeps,
all
that
slithers.
It's
all
right.



JAPHETH:
Father!
Father!
Don't
be
afraid.
No
one
will
hurt
this
boy.
What's
your
name?
-
Ham.
Oh.
I
am
Tubal-cain.
Do
you
know
me?
You
don't
know
your
king?
My
father
says
in
The
Creator's
garden.

Hmm.


Ham,
come
here.
Do
not
take
my
best
soldier.
He's
nothing
of
yours.
Look
at
his
hand
on
that
weapon.
I
believe
he
is
Ham.
Leave
it.
No,
he
gave
it
to
me.
Do
what
I
tell
you.
When
I
heard
But
then
I
saw
the
birds

had
to
come.
There
isn't

No?
This
all
belongs
to

This

This

yours.
Did
you
really
think

in
that?
It's
not
protection
from

is
it?
An

will

Will

We

Until

No.

What

I've

Seeing

The

The

The

So

Whatever

A
real

He

I
can't
give
any
of
that
to

And
I'm
not
going

me
to.
I
won't
do
it.
Besides,
why
would
The

it.

No.
Noah.
There's

in

Look
at

Shem's
loyalty.
Ham's
integrity.
Hmm?
Good

They'd

No,
no...
It's
all
right.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
I
have
food.
Here.
What
do
you
want?
Nothing.


Are
you
alone?
Yes.
And
you?

I
can
help
you
get
away.
No.
Well,
then,
If
that
is
all
right?
My
name
is
Na'el.
NOAH:
Shem!
Go
and
find
them
Be
careful.
Ham?

Don't
be
afraid,
granddaughter.
Don't
be
afraid.
Grandfather?
Yes.
What
are
you
doing
down
here?
I'm
looking
for
berries.
Come
and
help
me
look
for
them.
My
eyes
aren't
as
good
I
have
to
find
Ham.
There's
time
enough
for
that.
Come
here.
Come.
Come
here
and
help
me.
They're
here
somewhere.
They're
here
somewhere,
berries.
I
know
there
are
berries.
There's
nothing
here,
-
Let
me
take
you
to
Noah.
No
need
for
that.
You
go.
Oh,
wait.
Wait.
Ten
years
you've
been
With
my
own
family.
Ten
years.
Shem?
And
Noah?
He
saved
my
life.
Raised
me.
Yes,
he
did.
Yes.
And
you
are
now
My
own
great-granddaughter.
Ten
years
in
the
shadow
and
yet
I
have
never
May
I?



SHEM:
Ham!
Ila!
You
can
go
now.
Go
to
him.
You
go.
Go
now.
SHEM:
Ila!
Ila!
Ila!
We
have
to
get
back...




We
have
to
go.
We
have
to
go.
I
am
a
man.
Made
in
Your
image.
Why
will
You

I
give
life.
I
take
life
away.
And
I
am
like
You,
am
I
not?
Speak
to
me.

Speak
to
me!
It
has
begun!
Death
comes
from
the
heavens!
This
rain
is
meant
to
wash
us
off
But
we
are
men.
We
decide
if
we
live
or
die.
We
are
men!
And
men
united
are
invincible!
Do
you
want
to
live?
ALL:
Yeah!
We
kill
the
giants!
We
kill
Noah!
We
take
the
ark!
ALL:
Yeah!
NAAMEH:
Noah!
Where's
Ham?



Get
it
off
me,
no!
Ow!



No,
no,
no!
We
have
to
get
away!
I
won't
leave
you.
I
won't!

NOAH:
Ham!
Father,
help!
Help!
-
Help
her!
Please,
help
me,
please!
Please...
Help
me!
No!

NOAH:
Ham!
Ham!
Ham!
Ham!


Ham!
Ham!
Ham!
Samyaza!
Samyaza!
Samyaza!
-
Noah!
Ham
is
through!
Quickly!
Run!
NAAMEH:
Ham.
Ham!



TUBAL-CAIN:
Faster!
Forward!

Protect
your
mother.

Part!








SAMYAZA:
My
Creator,
forgive
me.

The
Creator
brings
him
home.


NAAMEH:
Ham?
Ham?















Shem.
Shem,
go
inside.
Go
inside.
They
are
upon
us.
Go
inside!

Good-bye,
son
of
Adam.



Son,
where
are
you?
Ham!


Ham?
Ham?




It's
all
right.

ILA:
-
Shem!
NAAMEH:
Japheth,
SHEM:
-
Ila,
I'm
here!
ILA:
Mother,
where's
Father?



Please,
Noah,
there
must
be
We
can
drag
ropes.
They
cannot
all
be
soldiers,
Father.
They
are
just
people.
There
is
no
room
for
them.



Soon
everything
All
that
is
left
of
Creation
Outside,
just
the
waters
of
chaos
again.
You
are
angry.
You
judge
me.
Let
me
tell
you
a
story.
The
first
story
and
the
first
story
In
the
beginning,
there
was
nothing.
Nothing
but
the
silence
But
the
breath
of
The
Creator
the
face
of
the
void,
"Let
there
be
light.
"
And
light
was.
And
it
was
good.
The
first
day.
And
then
the
formless
light
began
to
take
on
A
second
day.
And
our
world
was
born.
Our
beautiful,
fragile
home.
And
a
great,
warming
light
And
a
lesser
light
And
there
was
evening.
Another
day.
And
the
waters
of
the
world
and
in
their
midst
Another
day
passed.
And
the
ground
put
forth
A
thick
blanket
of
green
stretching
across
all
Creation.
And
the
waters,
too,
Great
creatures
of
the
deep
Vast
multitudes
of
fish,
some
of
which
may
still
And
soon
the
sky
And
there
was
evening.
And
there
was
morning.
Now
the
whole
world
Everything
that
creeps,
and
every
beast
And
it
was
good.
There
was
light
and
soil,
There
were
plants
and
fish
each
after
their
own
kind.
All
part
of
the
greater
whole.
And
all
was
in
balance.
A
jewel
in
The
Creator's
palm.
Then
The
Creator
made
Man.
Father
and
mother
of
us
all.
He
gave
them
a
choice.
Follow
the
temptation
or
hold
on
to
the
But
they
ate
from
Their
innocence
And
so
for
the
ten
generations
has
walked
within
us.
Brother
against
brother.
Nation
against
nation.
Man
against
Creation.
We
murdered
each
other.
We
broke
the
world.
Man
did
this.
Everything
that
was
beautiful,
everything
that
was
good,
we
shattered.
Now,
it
begins
again.
Air,
water,
earth,
plant,
Paradise
returns.
But
this
time,
this
time
there
will
be
no
men.
If
we
were
to
enter
it
would
only
be
No.
The
Creator
has
judged
us.
Mankind
must
end.
Shem
and
Ila,
you
will
bury
your
mother
and
I.
Ham,
you
will
bury
them.
Japheth
will
lay
you
to
rest.
You,
Japheth,
you
will
be
the
last
man.
And
in
time
you,
too,
Creation
will
be
left
alone,
safe
and
beautiful.
I'm
very
sorry
about
that
girl.
And
I'm
sorry
for
you.
But
we
have
been
entrusted
with
a
task
much
greater
than
our
own
desires.
Ham.




TUBAL-CAIN:
Shh.
Noah...
Does
he
know
I'm
here?
-
Does
he
know
I'm
here?
Why
are
you
helping
me?
There
was
a
girl.
I
tried
to
bring
her.
But
he
just
let
her
die.
Ah.

And
now
you
want
revenge.
No.
Yes,
you
do.
Yes,
you
do.
There's
no
more
land.
Everything
out
there
It
had
to
be
what
He
wanted.
A
world
without
man.
You
see
that,
don't
you?
What
I
see
is
how
hard
this
was
as
a
man
who
respects
life,
a
man
who
loves
his
children.
You've
been
strong.
But
it's
done.
It's
done
now.
And
you
can
put
Noah.
It's
all
right.
TUBAL-CAIN:
If
your
father
found
me,
he
would
kill
me.
We
must
be
ready,
Mmm.
What
are
you
doing?
I
must
get
my
strength
back.
The
beasts
are
precious.
And
there
is
only
one
of
me.
But
the
rain,
all
these
miracles,
Them?
Your
father
fills
He
belittles
you
by
telling
you,
Oh,
no.
They
serve
us.
That
is
the
greatness
of
men.
When
The
Creator
the
ground,
the
sea,
He
wasn't
satisfied.
He
needed
something
greater.
to
take
dominion
over
it
Mmm.
So
He
made
us
in
His
image.
Us.
This
is
your
world,
Ham.
Seize
it.


Ila.


Oh,
Grandfather.
What
is
it?
You're
not
sick.
But
that's
impossible.


What?
What
is
it?
Noah.
It
is
his
grandchild.

What's
wrong?
-
Father.
We've
come
to
ask
I
don't
understand.
I
am
with
Child.
It's
not
possible.
You're
barren.
You
can't
conceive.
How...
-
How
is
that
possible?
-
I
asked
Grandfather...
Undermine
The
Creator?
To
give
our
children
a
future.
To
give
humanity
a
future.
Have
you
any
idea
All
those
lives!
For
nothing!
Do
you
know
what


NOAH:
No!


Please!
Please!
Please!
I
cannot
do
this!
Tell
me
I
don't
need
to
do
this!
Please.
Have
I
not
done
everything
Is
that
not
enough?
Why
do
You
not
answer
me?
Why?
I
will
not
fail
You.
I
will
not
fail
You.
I
will
not
fail
You.
It
shall
be
done.


It
shall
be
done.
Father?
ILA:
The
rains
have
stopped.
The
Creator
smiles
on
our
child.
The
rains
have
stopped
but
He
does
not
smile.
If
your
child
is
a
boy,
he
will
replace
Japheth,
If
it
is
a
girl,
who
could
mature
into
a
mother,
she
must
die.

Are
you
mad?
That
is
my
Child!
If
you
should
bear
a
girl,
in
the
moment
of
her
birth,




Mother,
my
bird!
NAAMEH:
Nothing.
No
mud.
Nothing.
We
still
have
to
go.
Ila.
There's
nothing.
There's
nothing
out
there.
You
have
food
and
water
-
A
month?
Please
wait.
Wait
until
the
bird
finds
land.
Japheth,
send
him
again.
-
He's
too
tired.
Here.
Please.
One
that
can
find
us
a
home.
No.
We
leave
today.
NAAMEH:
They
will
die
out
there.
Not
if
they
stay.
And
let
you
kill
their
child?
Noah.
Noah!
I
did
this.
I
did
this,
Noah!
Please!
Punish
me!
Punish
me,
Noah!
Not
them.
Not
the
child.
Please.
The
child
is
not
being
punished.
We
are
all
being
punished.
All
of
us.
It's
not
something
I
want
to
do.
It's
something
I
have
to
do.
It
is
painful,
but
it
is
just.
Just?
How?
How
is
this
just?

If
you
hold
to
this,
you
will
lose
your
sons,
you
will
lose
me.
I
love
you,
Noah.
And
I
have
Through
everything.
I
forgave
you.
When
everyone
was
dead,
I
was
ready
to
die
with
you.
But
this
I
will
never
forgive.
Boy
or
girl,
And
you
will
die
alone!
Hated
by
everyone
you
love!
That
is
just!
That
is
just.

TUBAL-CAIN:
Oh...
Oh.
It's
time.
Bring
him
through
there.
One
blow
will
finish
it.

Just
in
case,
huh?
I
don't
know
if
I
can.
He
killed
your
woman.
And
now
he
plots
to
kill
Is
that
what
you
want?
You
want
your
sister
A
man
isn't
ruled
by
the
heavens.
A
man
is
ruled
by
his
will.
So
I
ask
you,
are
you
a
man?
Good.
Because
if
you're
a
man,
you
can
kill.
But
he
won't
follow
me.

SHEM:
Thank
you,
Japheth.
You
take
care
of
that
baby.
Don't
be
afraid,
Mother.
We'll
see
each
other

Father.

SHEM:
No!
No!
How
could
you?
I
thought
you
were
good!
I
thought
that's
why
He
chose
you.
He
chose
me
because
nothing
more,
son.

Mother.

Mother.
It's
your
time.

Come.
Come
with
me.
You're
all
right.
SHEM:
Japheth,
stand
back.
NAAMEH:
Come
now.
Come
inside.
That's
right.
You're
all
right,
Ila.

Please
keep
it
inside.
Your
baby's
coming.
Your
baby's
coming,
Ila.
Don't
think
about
anything
else.



Father!
Father,
they're
awake!
They're
awake!
-
The
beasts.
Come.
Come!
It's
not
possible
for
without
our
help.
Which
way,
son?



That's
right.

The
line
of
Cain.
I
told
you,
I'm
not
afraid
of
miracles.


NAAMEH:
That's
right.
That's
right.
A
bit
more.




Boy
or
girl?
What's
happening?

There's
another.
Two?
Twins.





Mother,
so?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
so
sorry.
Sisters.
No.

No!
No!

No!
He
will
not
touch
our
daughters.
No!
Shem!
Shem!
TUBAL-CAIN:
I
should
have
killed
Well,
now
we
finish
it.
Now!


The
evils
of
mankind
will

Leave
us!
Leave
us
alone!
TUBAL-CAIN:
He's
mine!
The
ark,
the
beasts,
and
all
I
will
build
a
new
world
in
my
image!
Now
you
are
a
man.

The
Creator
Her
name
was
Na'el.
She
was
innocent.
She
was
good.
It's
a
boy.
It's
a
boy.
-
It's
a
boy.
It's
a
boy.
Where
is
she?

Where
is
she?


No.
No.
No.

You
can't.
They're
beautiful.
They?
You
can't
kill
two.
He
sent
us
what
we
need.
Oh,
no.
No.
No!
You
can't!
No!
NAAMEH:
Noah!
Ila!
Noah.
Please.
These
are
my
children!
-
Your
grandchildren!
I
know
I
cannot
stop
you,
Please
don't
let
them
die
crying.
Let
me
calm
them.
Please,
just
let
them
be
at
peace.


The
moon
is
high
The
leaves
entwine
Your
Father
waits
for
thee
To
wrap
you
in
To
whisper
you
to
sleep
To
wrap
you
in
His
welcoming
arms
Till
the
night
sky
breaks
Your
Father
is
the
healing
wind
That
whispers
you
to
sleep
That
whispers
as
You
sleep
You
do
not
need
to
see
this.
I
will
hold
them.
Do
it
quickly.

Do
it
quickly!



I
cannot
do
this.

SHEM:
It's
all
right.



SHEM:
Hide
your
eyes,
Japheth.
NOAH:
-
Ham?

You
don't
have
to
go.
I
don't
belong
here.
For
what
it's
worth,
I'm
glad
that
Maybe
we'll
learn
to
be
kind.
Will
he
come
back?
Some
things
cannot
be
unbroken.
I
have
to
know...
Why
did
you
spare
them?
I
looked
down
and
all
I
had
in
my
heart
Then
why
are
you
alone,
Noah?
Why
are
you
separated
Because
I
failed
Him.
And
I
failed
all
of
you.
Did
you?
He
chose
you
for
a
reason,
Noah.
He
showed
you
and
knew
you
would
But
then
you
saw
goodness,
too.
The
choice
was
put
in
your
He
asked
you
to
decide
And
you
chose
mercy.
You
chose
love.
He
has
given
us
a
second
chance.
Be
a
father.
Be
a
grandfather.
Help
us
to
do
better
this
time.
Help
us
start
again.




The
Creator
made
Adam
in
His
image,
and
placed
the
world
That
birthright
was
passed
down
to
us.
To
my
father,
then
to
me,
Shem,
Japheth,
and
Ham.
That
birthright
our
grandchildren.
This
will
be
your
work,
and
your
responsibility.
So
I
say
to
you,
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth.
