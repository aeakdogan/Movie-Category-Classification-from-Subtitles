is
another
lie.
-
You
owe
me
that
much.
You're
going
to
tell
them
Hannibal,
it's
meaningless
You
and
those
boys.
Your
rank,
your
reputation.
They're
shit!
You're
convicts,

And

you
do
that?
To
us
What
Morrison
did?
No,
I'd
rather
Face
a
firing
Yeah
but
you
didn't
see
it
coming
though.
No
I...
I
didn't
see
it
coming.
Move!
Wow,
that's
awesome.
That
looks
exactly
like
All
right

the
deal,
no
press
release
Get
a
three
mile
quarantine
Get

I
thought
you
and
Smith
You
thought
wrong.
Yes
we
have
weapons.
You
want
a
deal?
I'll
make
you
a
deal.
How
about
I
dedicate
my
immediate
future
-
to
destroying
yours?
and
start
dealing
before
Former
Captain.
Whoa,
whoa
whoa.
Unless
you've
got
a
piece
of
paper
then
this
troubled
young
Let's
go.
How
the
hell
did
they
Sorry
Pike,
at
least
The
CIA's
got
rules.
Our
rules
Go.
You
know
Lynch,
if
I
could
I'd
be
doing
the
world
a
big
favor.
That's
not
nice.
-
Answer
me.
If
that
gun
ship
is
still
around
Idiot
Lynch,
was
so
quick
to
kill
Where
do
we
stand
in
non
violence
now
BA?
Are
you
pissed?
You
should
be.
Who
gives
a
shit
about
the
plates?
and
without
Morrison,
we
got
nothing.
-
What
do
we
do
boss?
-
I
don't
know.
This
guy
Lynch,
I
think
-
You
got
a
plan
kid?
Give
me
twenty
minutes.
So
Morrison's
dead
Smith
Another
fifteen
minutes
or
so
-
This
is
you
gloating?
After
you
burned
me.
-
Not
you
and
me.
-
Not
you
and
me
directly.
-
Hey,
what
are
you
doing?
-
He's
going
to
do
it?
-
What
are
you
doing?
What
is
he
doing?
-
I'm
good.
What
are
you
doing?
It's
a
suppressor
counter
clockwise.
You're
holding
a
gun
like
that?
and
you're
still
here?
That's
amazing.
Jesus,
hey,
final
request
don't
-
So
if
Sosa
knows
we're
alive.
Let's
just
hope
that
Lynch
-
This
is
Sosa.
What?
I'm
sorry
I
can't
-
Okay
this
was
not
well
thought
out.
I
mean
I
gotta
teach
you
how
to
-
Put
the
barrel,
put
the
gun
flush
to
my
head.
-
There
you
go,
right
there.
We're
okay.
Never
cuff
a
man
ia
a
seated
position
makes
it
impossible
to
see
the
hands.
-
That
was
cool.
Oh
I
liked
that,
I
liked
that
a
-
Yeah
it
was
a
good
hit.
We
don't
need
to
use
them
Who
are
you
talking
to?
Brad,
phone
or
gun
phone
or
gun,
pick.
-
Put
the
gun
down.
-
I
really
want
to
shoot
you.
-
Is
this
Smith?
I
know
I've
got
about
thirty
So
listen,
we
can
prove
our
innocence.
Okay
now
go
back
to..
did
you
say
you
-
Correct.
And
well.
That's
why
Lynch
is
trying
Too
much
to
explain
now,
but
and
fries
Lynch.
Uh
Oh.
-
Well
not
without
the
plates.
Remember,
Lynch
thinks
we're
dead
-
and
I
want
to
keep
it
that
way.
You
still
use
a
pen?
LA
docks,
48
hours,
dawn.
If
I
In
return,
I
want
a
re-trial
All
right
we'll
deal.
LA
Any
bullshit
from
your
end
-
Did
we
get
him?
Pike,
do
you
believe
in
second
chances?
Ahhh...
I
do
now.
-
Too
much?
My
turn.
Hold
on
to
that
phone.

This
is
Sosa.
Thank
you.
Well

got
the
raw
end
Look

a
huge
banana

guy
who
needs
anonymity.
He's

it?
Very
nice.
So
he
stays
as
far
away
and
never
gets
his
hands
But
