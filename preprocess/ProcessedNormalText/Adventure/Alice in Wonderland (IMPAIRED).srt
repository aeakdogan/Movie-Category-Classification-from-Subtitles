Charles,
you
have
This
venture
is
impossible.
For
some.
Gentlemen,
the
only
way
is
to
believe
it
is
possible.
That
kind
of
thinking
could
ruin
you.
I'm
willing
to
take
that
chance.
Imagine
trading
posts
The
nightmare
again?
I
won't
be
long.
I'm
falling
down
a
dark
hole,
then
I
see
strange
creatures.
What
kind
of
creatures?
Well,
there's
a
dodo
bird,
I
didn't
know
cats
could
smile.

Neither
did
l.
And
there's
a
blue
caterpillar.
Blue
caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do
you
think
I've
gone
round
the
bend?
I'm
afraid
so.
But
I'll
tell
you
a
secret.

It's
only
a
dream,
Alice.
But
if
you
get
too
frightened,

Ow!

Must
we
go?
Doubt
they'll
notice
if
we
never
arrive.
They
will
notice.
Where's
your
corset?
And
no
stockings.
I'm
against
them.
But
you're
not
properly
dressed.
Who's
to
say
what
is
proper?
What
if
it
was
agreed
that
"proper"
-Would
you
wear
it?
To
me,
a
corset
is
like
a
codfish.
Please,
not
today.
Father
would
have
laughed.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
tired.
Did
you
have
bad
dreams
again?
Only
one.
It's
always
the
same,
Do
you
think
that's
normal?
Don't
most
people
I
don't
know.
There.
You're
beautiful.
Now,
can
you
manage
a
smile?

At
last.
We
thought
you'd
never
arrive.
Alice,
Hamish
is
waiting
You
do
realize
it's
well
past
4:00.
Now
everything
will
have
-I
am
sorry.
Forgive
my
wife.
She's
been
planning
If
only
Charles
were
here...
My
condolences.
I
think
of
your
husband
often.
I
hope
you
don't
think
I've
taken
Of
course
not.
I'm
pleased
I
was
a
fool
for
not
investing
in
Charles
thought
so,
too.
(CLASSICAL
MUSIC
Hamish,
do
you
ever
tire
of
quadrille?
On
the
contrary.
I
find
it
invigorating.

Do
I
amuse
you?
No.
I
had
a
sudden
vision
and
the
men
wearing
dresses.
I
think
you'll
do
best
When
in
doubt,
remain
silent.


Pardon
us,
sir.
Where's
your
head?
I
was
wondering
Why
would
you
spend
your
time
thinking
about
Why
wouldn't
l?
My
father
said
he
sometimes
believed
before
breakfast.

Come
along.
Alice,
meet
me
under
the
gazebo

We
have
a
secret
to
tell
you.
If
you're
telling
me,
-Perhaps
we
shouldn't.
If
we
tell
her,
she
won't
be
surprised.
-Will
you
be
surprised?
But
now
you've
brought
it
up,
-No,
we
don't.
I
wonder
if
your
mother
knows
that
you
two
swim
naked
-You
wouldn't.
There's
your
mother
right
now.
Hamish
is
going
to
ask
for
your
hand.
You've
ruined
the
surprise!
I
could
strangle
them!
Everyone
went
to
so
much
effort
Does
everyone
know?
It's
why
they've
all
come.
Hamish
will
ask
you
under
the
gazebo.
But
I
don't
know
Who,
then?
You'll
soon
be
20,
Alice.
You
don't
want
to
end
up
And
you
don't
want
to
be
a
burden
No.
So
you'll
marry
Hamish.
You
will
be
as
happy
and
your
life
will
be
perfect.
It's
already
decided.
Alice,
dear.
I'll
leave
you
to
it.
Shall
we
take
a
leisurely
stroll
Do
you
know
what
I've
always
dreaded?
The
decline
of
the
aristocracy?
Ugly
grandchildren.
But
you're
lovely.
You're
bound
to
produce
The
gardeners
have
when
I
specifically
asked
for
red.
You
could
always
paint
the
roses
red.
What
an
odd
thing
to
say.
You
should
know
that
my
son

-Did
you
see
that?
-It
was
a
rabbit,
I
think.
I
do
enjoy
setting
the
dogs
on
them.
If
you
serve
Hamish
the
wrong
foods,

Did
you
see
it
that
time?
-See
what?
Don't
shout.
Now,
pay
attention.
-What
was
I
saying?
I
couldn't
be
more
interested,
Aunt
Imogene.
I
think
I'm
going
mad.
I
can't
be
bothered
I'm
waiting
for
my
fiancé.
-You
have
a
fiancé?

There!
Did
you
see
it?
He's
a
prince.
But,
alas,
he
cannot
marry
me
It's
tragic,
isn't
it?
Very.
Lowell?
Alice.
We
were
just...
Hattie's
an
old
friend.
I
can
see
you're
very
close.
Look,
you
won't
mention
this
I
don't
know.
I'm
confused.
Well,
think
about
Margaret.
You
don't
want
to
ruin
her
marriage,
Me?
But
I'm
not
the
one
who's
There
you
are.
Alice
Kingsleigh...
Hamish.
What
is
it?
You
have
a
caterpillar
Ew.
Don't
hurt
it.
You'll
want
to
wash
that
finger.
Alice
Kingsleigh,
will
you
be
my
wife?
Well,
everyone
expects
me
to,
and
you're
a
lord.
My
face
won't
last,
But
this
is
happening
so
quickly.
l...
I
think
l...

I
think
l...
I
need
a
moment.

Hello.








It's
only
a
dream.

DODO:
You'd
think
she
would
MALLY:
You've
brought
the
wrong
Alice.
McTWISP:
No,
she's
the
right
one.


MALLY:
She's
the
wrong
Alice.
McTWISP:
Give
her
a
chance.




Curiouser
and
curiouser.
I
told
you
she's
the
right
Alice.
I
am
not
convinced.
McTWISP:
How
is
that
for
gratitude?
I've
been
up
there
for
weeks,
and
I
was
almost
eaten
Can
you
imagine?
They
go
about
entirely
unclothed,
-I
had
to
avert
my
eyes.
That's
because
she's
the
wrong
Alice.
-If
she
was,
she
might
be.
-But
if
she
were
so,
she
would
be.
How
can
I
be
the
wrong
Alice
And
who
are
you,
if
I
might
ask?
Oh,
I'm
Tweedledee,
he's
Tweedledum.
Contrariwise,
I'm
Tweedledum,
We
should
consult
Absolem.
Exactly.
Absolem
will
know
who
she
is.
-I'll
escort
you.
So
unfair.
-Hey,
leave
off!
-Are
they
always
this
way?
You
can
both
escort
her.

-Who
is
this
Absolem?
He's
Absolem.
Who
are
you?
Absolem?
You're
not
Absolem,
I'm
Absolem.

Alice.
We
shall
see.
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
Yes,
you
ought,
stupid
girl.
The
Oraculum,
being
a
calendrical
-It's
a
calendar.
It
tells
of
each
and
every
day
Today
is
Griblig
Day
Show
her
the
Frabjous
Day.
Mmm.
Yeah,
Frabjous
being
the
day
Sorry?
Slay
a
what?
Oh,
yeah.
That
being
you,
there,
No
other
swords
can
kill
If
it
ain't
Vorpal,
it
ain't
dead.
That's
not
me!
I
know!
Resolve
this
for
us,
Absolem.
Not
hardly.
-I
told
you.
-I
said
so.
TWEEDLEDUM:
Contrariwise,
No,
you
said
she
would
be
if
she
was.

Little
impostor.
Pretending
I
was
so
certain
of
you.
I'm
sorry.
Wait,
this
is
my
dream.
I'm
going
to
wake
up
now
That's
odd.
I
could
stick
you,
if
that
would
help.
-It
might,
actually.
Thank
you.
Ow!

-Bandersnatch!






Wait.

It's
only
a
dream.
Nothing
can
hurt
me.
What's
she
doing?
Can't
hurt
me.
Can't
hurt
me.

Run,
you
great
lug!


This
way,
east
to
Queast.
No,
south
to
Snud.
No.
No,
no.
This
way.




Someone
has
stolen
three
of
my
tarts!
-Did
you
steal
them?
-Did
you?
-Did
you
steal
them?


Did
you
steal
my
tarts?
No,
Your
Majesty.

Squimberry
juice.
-I
was
so
hungry!
I
didn't
mean
to!

Oh,

please
don't!
No!
I
have

look
after!
Go

love

on
toast
Yes,
Your
Majesty.
Drink!
Majesty?
Ilosovic
Stayne,
you
knave,
Majesty,
I
have
found
the
Oraculum.
That?
Looks
so
ordinary
for
an
oracle.
Look
here,
on
the
Frabjous
Day.
I'd
know
that
tangled
mess
ls
it
Alice?
I
believe
it
is.
What's
she
doing
She
appears
to
be
slaying
it.
She
killed
my
Jabber-baby-wocky?
Not
yet,
but
it
will
happen
Find
Alice,
Stayne.
Find
her!

Find
the
scent
of
human
girl
For
my
wife
and
pups,
as
well?
Everyone
will
go
home.


Dogs
will
believe
anything.

It
looks
like
you
ran
afoul
of
something
And
I'm
still
dreaming.
What
did
that
to
you?
-Banner
or
Bander...
Well,
I'd
better
have
a
look.
What
are
you
doing?
It
needs
to
be
purified
or
it
will
fester
and
putrefy.
I'd
rather
you
didn't.
At
least
let
me
bind
it
for
you.
-What
do
you
call
yourself?
The
Alice?
-There's
been
some
debate
about
that.
You'd
best
be
on
your
way.
What
way?
All
I
want
to
do
is
Fine.
Then
I'll
take
you
to
the
Hare
Coming?





Watch
what
you're
doing!
Hey,
watch
it!
Okay,
okay.
All
right.
It's
you.
No,
it's
not.
It's
the
wrong
Alice!
It's
absolutely
Alice.
You're
absolutely
Alice.
I'd
know
him
anywhere.

HATTER:
Well,
as
you
can
see,
And
it's
all
because
I
was
obliged
You're
terribly
late,
you
know.
Naughty.
Well,
anyway,

stretched,
scratched
I've
been
accused
of
being
Alice

I'll

No.
Speak!

it's

No,

nohow!

I

I

Who,

What

I
take
off
your
head?

Stop
that.
What

large
head
I
should
very
much
like
to
hat
it.
-Hat
it?
I
used
to

Wasn't
very
much
to
work
with,
Her
head
is
so
small.
It's
tiny.
It's
a
pimple

But
this...
What
I
could
do
Nay,
this
magnificently
heroic

What
could
you
do?
Unbind

How
can

cap,
Hatter.
Fez?
Leave
us.
The
trees
seem
sad.
-Have
you
been
speaking
with
them?
Perhaps
a
bit
more
kindly.
Would
you
all
excuse
me
-What
news,
Bayard?
-Where
is
she
now?
Forgive
me.
I
allowed
her
No,
no,
no,
no.
But
that
is
exactly
We
have
our
champion.

ALICE:
Have
you
seen
You
must
find
Alice,
Stayne.
Without
the
Jabberwocky,
my
sister's
followers
Ugly
little
sister.
STAYNE:
I
cannot
fathom
it.
RED
QUEEN:
I
know.
But
Mirana
can
make
anyone
Men,
women,

even
the
furniture.
Even
the
King?
I
had
to
do
it.
He
would
have
left
me.
Majesty,
is
it
not
better
Not
certain
anymore.
Oh,
let
her
have
the
rabble.
I
have
you.
They're
wonderful.
You
must
let
me
try
one
on.
It
is
good
to
be
working
It's
just
a
pity
What
is
the
hatter
with
me?
Hatter?


Hatter.
Have
you
any
idea
I'm
frightened,
Alice.
I
don't
like
it
in
here.
Have
I
gone
mad?
I'm
afraid
so.
You're
entirely
bonkers.
But
I'll
tell
you
a
secret.
Here.
That's
better.
You
look
yourself
again.
RED
QUEEN:
Hat
man!
I'm
not
a
patient
monarch!
I'm
told
she
keeps
the
Vorpal
sword
The
rabbit
will
help
you.
Find
it,
Alice.
We'll
go
to
the
White
Queen
together.
Why
is
it
you're
always
too
small
-Tweedles.
-How
do
you
do,
again?
How
is
it
you're
being
so
great
big?
She
ain't
great
big,
I'm
certain
she's
smaller
when
we
met.
No,
she
drank
the
pishsalver
Oh,
yeah.
-Where's
the
rabbit?
-MALLY:
What
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
rescuing
the
Hatter.
He
told
me
that
the
Vorpal
sword
I
don't
take
orders
Shoo!
-What
is
it,
McTwisp?

The
sword's
hidden
inside.
Be
careful,
Alice.
I
know
that
smell.

I'm
not
going
in
there.
Look
what
that
thing
did
to
my
arm.
Dear,
oh,
dear.
It
wasn't
this
bad
before.

Hatter?
Where
are
you?
Hatter?
Mallymkun.
Do
you
still
have
Right
here.
-I
need
it.
Hey!
Give
it
back!
I
like
you,
Um.
I
like
largeness.
Get
away
from
me.


I
have
your
eye.




No.
Hmm.
MAN:
You
look
stunning
in
that
hat.
Yes.
Next.
Your
Majesty
has
never
looked
better.
Hmm.
Another.
Oh!
I
don't
wish
to
alarm
you,
but
it
smells
as
though

Never
mind
him,
he's
mad.

Stayne!
(BANDERSNATCH

I
suppose
this
makes
us
even
now.
Um
forced
herself
on
me.
I
told
her
my
heart
belongs
to
you,
Off
with
her
head!
Stand
back,
Mallymkun.
How's
this
for
muchness?
No,
no!
Arrest
that
girl
for
unlawful
seduction!
Hatter!
-Take
it
to
the
White
Queen.
Go!
Run,
Alice!
Alice?
Run!
Seize
her.
Alice.
Of
course.
Why
didn't
I
see
it?
Well,
it
has
been
a
long
time,
-Give
me
the
sword.
The
Queen
will
be
so
pleased.
She
will
take
great
pleasure

-Oh,
Alice!


Majesty,
Alice
has
escaped
on
the
Bandersnatch,
with
the
Vorpal
sword.
How
could
you
let
this
happen?
I
may
have
underestimated
her,
the
Hatter
and
a
dormouse.
Off
with
their
heads!
WHITE
QUEEN:
I
believe
this
belongs
to
you.
Mmm.
The
Vorpal
sword
is
home
again.
The
armor
is
complete.
Now
all
we
need
is
a
champion.
You're
a
little
taller
Blame
it
on
too
much
upelkuchen.
Oh.
Come
with
me.
ls
the
March
Hare
here?

You're
late
-You're
late
for
your
soup.
Come
here,
you!
Give
me
that
here.
Leek
and
potato.
Yes.
That
would
be...

Pishsalver.
Let
me
think.
A
pinch
of
worm
fat,
urine
of
the
horsefly,
buttered
fingers.
My
sister
preferred
to
study

Tell
me,
how
does
she
seem
to
you?
Perfectly
horrid.
-And
her
head?
I
think
she
may
have
something
pressing
on
her
brain.
Three
coins
from
a
dead
man's
pocket,
You
can't
imagine
the
things
Oh,
yes,
I
can.
But
when
a
champion
steps
forth
the
people
will
rise
against
her.

That
should
do
it.
Blow.
-Feel
better?
There's
someone
here
-Absolem?

I
thought
we'd
settled
this.
-How
do
you
know?
I
said
you
were
not
hardly
Alice,
but
you're
much
more
her
now.
In
fact,
you're
almost
Alice.
Even
so,
I
couldn't
slay
the
Jabberwocky
It
will.
So
I
suggest
when
the
Frabjous
Day
arrives.
You
seem
so
real.
Sometimes
I
forget

Will
you
stop
doing
that?


I've
always
admired
that
hat.
Hello,
Chess.
Since
you
won't
be
needing
it
would
you
consider
How
dare
you?
It
is
a
formal
execution.
It
is
a
pity
about
all
this.
I
was
looking
forward
I
was
rather
good
at
it,
was
I
not?
I
really
do
love
that
hat.
I
would
wear
it
I
love
a
morning
execution,
don't
you?
-Yes,
Your
Majesty.
-I'd
like
to
keep
it
on.
As
long
as
I
can
get
at
your
neck.
I'm
right
behind
you.
Off
with
his
head!
I
can't
watch.

Good
morning,
everyone.
Chess,
you
dog.
-
you
are
being
heinously
bamboozled
by
these
lickspittle
toadies

What
is
that?
I'm
not
the
only
one,
Majesty.
Look!
A
counterfeit
nose.
Me?
What
about
that
big
belly


Liars!
Cheats!
Falsifiers!
Off
with
their
heads!
The
abused
and
enslaved
all
of
you
stand
up
and
fight!
Rise
up
against
the
bloody
Red
Queen.
-Downal
wyth
Bluddy
Behg
Hid!

Release
the
Jubjub
Bird!



You're
right,
Stayne,
it
is
far
better
to
be
feared
than
loved.
Come,
boys.
Quickly!
Come
on!
Hatter!
Come
on,
Mally,
quickly.
Prepare
the
Jabberwocky
for
battle.
I
had
hoped
Why
don't
you
slay
You
must
have
the
power.
It
is
against
my
vows

We
have
company.
Have
a
look,
Bayard.
BAYARD:
Bielle.

I'm
so
happy
to
see
you.
So
did
l.
But
they
didn't,
And
I'm
rather
glad
about
that
I
would
have
regretted
especially
now
that
you're
you,
And
it's
a
good
size.
It's
a
great
size.
-Hatter.
Where's
your
hat?
Mmm.
-Cheshire.
All
healed.
Goodbye,
sweet
hat.
Have
you
any
idea
Let
me
think
about
it.
You
know
what
tomorrow
is,
don't
you?
Frabjous
Day.
How
could
I
forget?
Wish
I'd
wake
up.
-Still
believe
this
is
a
dream,
do
you?
This
has
all
come
from
my
own
mind.
Which
would
mean
that
I'm
not
real.
Afraid
so.
I
would
dream
up
someone
Yes,
yes.
But
you
would
have
to
be

I
must
be,
then.
I'll
miss
you
when
I
wake
up.

Who
will
step
forth
to
be
champion
That
would
be
l.
You
have
very
poor
evaporating
skills.
I'll
do
it.
-No,
me.
No
other
slayer,
nohow.
If
it
ain't
Alice,
it
ain't
dead.
Alice,
you
cannot
live
your
life
The
choice
must
be
yours,
because
when
you
step
out
you
will
step
out
alone.
Nothing
was
ever
accomplished
Absolem?
Why
are
you
upside
down?
I've
come
to
the
end
of
this
life.
-You're
going
to
die?
Don't
go.
I
need
your
help.
I
can't
help
you
if
you
don't
even
know
I'm
not
stupid.
My
name
is
Alice.
I
live
in
London.
I
have
a
mother
named
Helen
My
father
was
Charles
Kingsleigh.
He
had
a
vision
that
stretched
and
nothing
ever
stopped
him.
I'm
his
daughter.
I'm
Alice
Kingsleigh.
Alice,
at
last.
You
were
just
as
dim-witted
You
called
it
"Wonderland,"
as
I
recall.
Wonderland.

-What
do
you
call
yourself?
The
Alice?
Then
I'll
take
you
to
the
Hare
McTWISP:
She's
the
right
one.
Ah,
Thackery,
not
at
the
table,
please.
Have
some
tea.
You're
not
Absolem,

-What
is
this?
Contrariwise,
I'm
Tweedledum,
DODO:
You'd
think
she
would
Curiouser
and
curiouser.
It
wasn't
a
dream
at
all,
This
place
is
real,
And
the
Jabberwocky.
Remember,
the
Vorpal
sword
All
you
have
to
do
is
hold
on
to
it.
Fairfarren,
Alice.

-Hello,
Iracebeth.

On
this,
the
Frabjous
Day,
shall
send
forth
their
champions
Oh,
Racie.
We
don't
have
to
fight.
I
know
what
you're
doing.
You
think
you
can
blink
and
I'll
melt,
Please.
No!
It
is
my
crown!
I
am
the
eldest!
Jabberwocky!



This
is
impossible.
Only
if
you
believe
it
is.
Sometimes
I
believe
as
many
as
six
That
is
an
excellent
practice.
However,
just
at
the
moment,
you
really
might
want
Where's
your
champion,
Sister?
Here.
Hello,
Um.
Six
impossible
things.
One,
there's
a
potion

Two,
and
a
cake
So,
my
old
foe,
We've
never
met.
Not
you,
insignificant
bearer.
My
ancient
enemy,
the
Vorpal
one.
That's
enough
chatter.

Three,
animals
can
talk.
Four,
Alice,
cats
can
disappear.
Five,
there's
a
place
called
Wonderland.
Six,
I
can
slay
the
Jabberwocky.

The
Hatter's
interfering!



Off
with
your
head!
Kill
her!
We
follow
you
no
more,
How
dare
you?
Off
with
his
head!
Iracebeth
of
Crims,
your
crimes
However,
that
is
against
my
vows,
therefore,
you
are
banished
No
one
is
to
show
you
any
kindness,
You
will
not
have
a
friend
in
the
world.
Majesty,
I
hope
you
bear
me
no
ill
will.
Only
this
one,
Ilosovic
Stayne,
you
are
to
join
Iracebeth
in
banishment
from
this
day
At
least
we
have
each
other.


Majesty,
please!
Kill
me!
Please!
But
I
do
not
owe
you
a
kindness.
-STAYNE:
Take
off
my
head!
-Majesty!
Please!
Please!
-I
offer
you
my
head!
Oh,
the
Frabjous
Day!
Callou!
Callay!

-What
is
he
doing?



Blood
of
the
Jabberwocky.
And
for
your
efforts
on
our
behalf...
-Will
this
take
me
home?
You
could
stay.
What
an
idea.
But
I
can't.
There
are
questions
I
have
to
answer,
Be
back
again
before
you
know
it.
You
won't
remember
me.
Of
course
I
will.
How
could
I
forget?
Hatter,
why
is
a
raven
I
haven't
the
slightest
idea.
Fairfarren,
Alice.

She
left
me
standing
there
A
case
of
nerves,
no
doubt.
-Alice.
-Are
you
all
right?
I
fell
down
a
hole
and
hit
my
head.
I'm
sorry,
Hamish.
I
can't
marry
you.
And
there's
that
trouble
I
love
you,
Margaret,
but
this
is
my
life.
You're
lucky
to
have
my
sister
and
you
be
good
to
her.
There
is
no
prince,
Aunt
Imogene.
You
need
to
talk
to
someone
I
happen
to
love
rabbits,
Don't
worry,
Mother,
I'll
find
something
useful
You
two
remind
me
of
some
funny
boys
-You've
left
me
out.
You
and
I
have
business
to
discuss.
Shall
we
speak
in
the
study?
Oh.
And
one
more
thing.

My
father
told
me
he
planned
to
expand
but
I
don't
think
Why
not
go
all
the
way
to
China?
It's
vast,
the
culture
is
rich,
To
be
the
first
to
trade
with
China,
You
know,
if
anybody
else
I'd
say,
"You've
lost
your
senses."
But
I've
seen
that
look
before.
Well,
as
you're
not
going
to
be
perhaps
you'd
consider
becoming
Hello,
Absolem.

Tripping
out,
spinning
around
I'm
underground
Yeah,
I
fell
down
I'm
freaking
out
Upside
down
and
I
can't
stop
it
now
Can't
stop
me
now
I,
I'll
get
by
I,
I'll
survive
When
the
world's
crashing
down
I
will
turn
myself
around
I,
I
won't
cry
I
found
myself
in
Wonderland
Get
back
on
my
feet,
the
ground
Is
this
real?
Is
it
pretend?
I'll
take
a
stand
until
the
end
I,
I'll
get
by
I,
I'll
survive
When
the
world's
crashing
down
I
will
turn
myself
around
I,
I
won't
cry

Oh,
Alice,
dear,
where
have
you
been?
So
near,
so
far,
so
in
between
What
have
you
heard?
Alice,
Alice,
please,
Alice
Oh,
tell
us,
are
you
big
or
small?
To
try
this
one
or
try
them
all
It's
such
a
long,
long
way
to
fall
Alice,
Alice,
oh,
Alice
How
can
you
know
this
way,
not
that?
You
choose
the
door
Perhaps
you
should
be
coming
back
Another
day,
another
day
And
nothing
is
quite
what
it
seems
You're
dreaming
Oh,
Alice
Oh,
Alice
Oh!
Oh,
how
will
you
find
your
way?
Oh,
how
will
you
find
your
way?
No
time
for
tears
today
No
time
for
tears
today
So
many
doors,
how
did
you
choose?
So
much
to
gain,
so
much
to
lose
So
many
things
got
in
your
way
No
time
today,
no
time
today
Be
careful
not
to
lose
your
head
Remember
what
the
dormouse
said
Alice!
Did
someone
pull
you
by
the
hand?
How
many
miles
to
Wonderland?
Please
tell
us
so
we'll
understand
Alice,
Alice,
oh,
Alice
Oh,
how
will
you
find
your
way?
Oh,
how
will
you
find
your
way?
