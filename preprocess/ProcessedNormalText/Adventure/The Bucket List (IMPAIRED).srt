CARTER
:
It
was
a
Sunday
afternoon,
It's
difficult
to
understand
Some
people
will
tell
you
it's
measured
Some
believe
it
can
be
measured
Some
say
by
love.
Other
folks
say
life
has
Me?
I
believe
that
you
measure
yourself...
...
by
the
people
who
What
I
can
tell
you
for
sure
...
Edward
Cole
lived
more
in
his
last
...
than
most
people
manage
I
know
that
when
he
died,
...
and
his
heart
was
open.
MAN
1:
"
Name
the
five
presidents
whose
H?
Warren
G.
Harding,
...and
the
two
Harrisons,
Ah.
Thought
I'd
get
you
CARTER:
Ha-ha-ha.
You
think
that's
sick,
-
No.
MAN
2:
Yo,
Cartey-car!
-
When
they
need
the
Camaro,
man?
MAN
2:
-
All
right,
I
got
one
for
you.
Who
invented
the
radio?
Ah.
That's
a
hard
one.
-
What
do
you
know,
I
finally
got
you.
I
don't
know
if
you
want
who
...or
the
person
who
Well,
in
here
it
says...
Marconi,
right?
Yeah,
it
ain't
him?
He's
the
one
they
generally
think
In
fact,
he
got
a
Nobel
Prize
for
it
Truth
is
a
guy
named
Nikola
Tesla...
...patented
the
basic
idea
Same
idea
Marconi
used
for
his
patent

Tesla
fought
Marconi
till
Same
year
the
Supreme
Court
ruled...
...that
Marconi's
patent
was
invalid...
...recognizing
Tesla
as
Carter.
You
really
are
sick.
Oh,
hi,
Ginnie.
Well,
good.
About
time.
All
right,
what
does
that
mean?
Kopi
Luwak.
Take
a
whiff.
Go
ahead.

Uh,
Mr.
Cole,
the
board
is
ready
Hold
on
just
a
second.
Go
ahead.
Go
on.
Well?
Really
good.
Really
good.
Mr.
Cole.
Sir?
Do
you
know
what
a
Philistine
is,
Jim?
Sir,
it's
Richard.
That's
right,
Phil.
RICHARD:
Thank
you,
Mr.
Chairman,
We
at
the
Cole
Group
feel
...is
a
direct
result
of
significant

I
beg
your
pardon,
this
hospital...
Your
lease
and
land
costs
were
Donations
have
atrophied
to
the
point
...in
Research,
Pediatrics,
The
Cole
Group
has
privatized

...each
of
which
now
provides,
...the
highest
standard
of
medical
care
-
Despite
being
grossly
understaffed?
What
about
beds?
...you
increased
the
number
of
patients
Patient
density
has
always
been...
And
your
emergency
rooms,
I
run
hospitals,
not
health
spas.
Two
beds
to
a
room,
no
exceptions.
Look,
I
passed
up
a
lunch
...so
can
we
desist
Boys
and
girls,
you
need
me.
I
do
not
need
you.
Now,
there's
a
sizeable
check
...let
me
know
if
you
decide

Mr.
Cole,
are
you
all
right?
[WOMAN
SPEAKING
What
are
you
doing
here?
Oh,
you
know,
Uh,
no,
I
was
just
surprised...
EDWARD:
And
tell
Dr.
Shit-for-Brains...
...I
wanna
know
everything
about
this
I
hear
it
eats
your
lungs.
When
I
address
Congress
...I
don't
want
to
do
it
breathing
-
That's
not
exactly
what
happens.
-
Where's
Thomas?
Tom!
-
Hi,
Tom.
I
can
do
it
myself.
I
ain't
dead
yet.


How
about
now?
Have
I
fired
you
lately?
Not
since
the
Oprah
incident.
-
That
was
a
good
one.
Ha-ha-ha.
Who
the
hell
is
that?
Who
the
hell
are
you?
He
said,
"Who
the
hell...?"
Oh,
God.
What
am
I,
in
the
morgue?
CARTER:
That
was
the
first
time
An
inauspicious
beginning,
to
be
sure.
EDWARD:
I
hate
these...
I
hate
tubes!

I'll
be
damned
if
I'm
gonna
spend
the
Zombie
boy.
Looks
half-dead
already.
You
can't
have
your
own
room.
I
don't
give
a
shit
about
PR.
I
want
my
own
room.
Don't
tell
me
I
can't
have
No
offense,
pal.
You
have
publicly
defended
this
policy
You
run
hospitals,
not
health
spas.
I've
never
been
sick
before.
Okay,
Dr.
Eldridge
will
be
in
Dot
me
up.
Jesus.
Thomas...

I'll
do
what
I
can.
This
really
your
hospital?
Yeah,
pretty
much.
Might
wanna
do
something
CARTER:
...
the
cancer
had
spread
so
far
...
that
the
doctors
gave
him
only
...
but
then,
they
didn't
account
VIRGINIA:
No
visitors
come
in
to
see
him?
He's
been
sleeping
a
lot
VIRGINIA:
That's
another
reason
It's
always
so
sad
seeing
...after
that
kind
of
surgery.
At
least
he's
quiet.
MAN
:
Day
after
day,

Rachel
called
this
morning.
Really?
How's
she
doing?
She's
auditioning
for
first
violin

That's
wonderful.
Need
any
more
books?
No,
I'm...
I'm
fine.
Got
your
meds
for
the
night?
Mm-hm.
I
already
took
them.
How
about
pillows?
I'm
fine,
Virginia,
really.
Thank
you.
You
know,
I
could
stay
a
while
No
use
both
of
us
being
useless
Okay.

She
gone?
What?
As
something
of

believe
more
people
die
...than

Correct!

Who

You

Oh.
Sorry.
No.
-
What
is
the

Trench?
Good
morning,
Edward.
-
Morning.
Dumb
question.
How's
that
catheter?
Don't
know
how
I
ever
did
without
it.
Ah,
humor
is
a
good
sign.
Kiss
my
ass.
As
is
surliness.
-
Yeah.
It
looks
good.
All
right,
so
the
operation
All
the
post-op
brain
scans
are
clean.
Now
we
go
after
the

Now,
unfortunately,
...so
I
would
like
to
begin

Love
the
smell
of

Apocalypse
Now,
right?
Makes
me
feel
like
victory!

-
I'll
check
in
with
you
later.
Say,
doc?
Doc?
You
think
you
could
just
-
Sorry,
I'm
late.
Who's
your
doctor?
I'll
let
the
nurse
know.
Appreciate
it.

Bitch,
ain't
it?
-
What
are
quarks?

How
long
you
been
here?
In

out
over
the
past
few
months.

What
is
the
quadratic

How
rough
is
it?
Chemo?
Not
too
bad.
If
you
don't
mind
...watching
your
veins
turn
black...
...and
feeling
like
your
bones
are
...it's
a
day
at
the
beach.
That's
a
relief.
Of
course,
I
hear
people
You'll
know
by
tonight.
Tonight?
Listen,
um...
...you
don't
mind
my
asking...
...what
is
that
contraption
It's
a
siphon.
Makes
coffee.
What
else
does
it
do?
What
else
does
it
have
to
do?

Did
you
know
that
coffee
was
originally

You
don't
say.
Seems
his
goats
were
eating
berries
Before
long,
they
were
running

a
gay
old

So
the

took
some

the
abbots
decided
When
the
berries
burned...
...the
beans
inside
gave
off
...they
brewed
them
into
a
stew.
Stew,
huh?
And
over
the
next
few
hundred
years,
...even
Sumatra,
It's
called
Kopi
Luwak.
I
know
what
it's
called.
You
do?
Never
catch
me
drinking
that
shit.
Have
you
ever
tried
it?
No.
I'm
more
of
a
instant-coffee
man.
Here,
here
we
are.
-
Thanks.
There
you
are.
You
always
had
those
freckles?
Far
as
I
know.
Nice...
...freckles.
Hmm.

THOMAS:
Okay,
we
got
prosciutto
...and
a
veal
paillard.
The
folks
at
Toscana
send
their
best.
You
sure
you
wanna
eat
all
that?
That's
the
plan.

What?
Oh,
Uh...
You
want
Thomas
Tommy,
uh,

a

First

Interesting.
So

No,

Mm,

Mr.

EDWARD:
Don't
pay
any
attention
It's
from
Kai.
Says
he
wants
to
be
a
mechanic
I
hope
you
talked
him
out
of
that.
Well,
I
tried.
What
do
we
got
here?
ROGER:

-
I
always
wanted
one
of
those.
-
Kai
remembered.
Um...
Mom
seems
to
think
Mm-hm.
She
loves
you,
Pop.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
You'll,
uh,
call

you
get
Mm-hm.
If
that

ever
comes.
Okay.

Take
care.
He

Yeah.
What's

Here.
His

EDWARD:
That's

Youngest

Big
age
difference.
Yeah,
well,
she
was
a
surprise.
We'd
hardly
gotten

out
She's
an
outstanding
violinist.
You
got
kids?
Depends.

Never
stayed
married
long
enough.
...don't
worry,
I've
been

How's
that
going?
It's
going.
That

Well,
that's
why

Hard

perfect.
Only
successful

I
started
making
money
...and
that
was
that.
Never
stopped.
I'll
be
damned.
I
wanted
to
be
a
history
professor.
Nobody's
perfect.

I
made
it
through
two
months
...before
Virginia
gave
me
the
news.
And
then,
you
know...
...young,
black,
broke,
Take
the
first
decent
job
I
always
meant
to
go
back...
...but
45
years
goes
by
pretty
fast.
Like

Suicide?
Me?

no.
Thought
so.
Stage

What?
The
five
stages,

Denial.
Then
anger,
bargaining,
So
of
course
you're
not
You're
in
stage
one.
Denial.
What
stage
are
you
in?
Denial.
And
thinking
about
suicide.
Yeah,
okay.
It's
just
a
frame
of...
Well,
it
looks
like
you
won't

That's
it?
What's
next?
They
have
to
run
all
the
tests
first,

Well,
how
long?
I'll
get
Dr.

them
Thanks.

Edward?
How's
it
going
there?
Dumb
question.
I
got
the

back.
I'll
just
lay
it
out,
huh?
Six
months.
A
year
if
we're
lucky.
There
is
an

I
don't
wanna

blocking

there's

question.
Sure,

What

Come
on,
give

Give
it
back.
It
was
on
the
floor.
Well,
my
freshman
...assigned
this
exercise
He
called
it
a
"Bucket
List."
We
were
supposed
to
make
a
list
...before
we...
Cutesy.
Anyway,
I
wrote
things
like
..."first
black
president,"
I
was
gonna
redo
the
list,
but
then...
"Help
a
complete
stranger
"Laugh
until
I
cry."
Not
to
be
judgmental,
Well,
it's
pointless
now.
I
would
argue
the
exact
opposite.
All
right.
That's
it.
What
are
you
doing?
A
little
rewrite,
that's
all.
I
mean,
don't
you
want
to
go
out
Have
a
little
fun?
It
was
not
supposed
to
be

Eh.

A

maybe.
You

45
years

We

We

No,
I
couldn't.
Don't
think
about
money.
But
I
don't
know.

What
don't
you
know?
It
was
meant
to
be
metaphorical.

trying

on...
Metaphors.
You're
the
one
crying
you
never
My
chance
to
what?
Never
too
late.
What
do
you
think
happens
now?
I
go
back

sit
around

about

financing
...pretending
that
I
care
You
go
home
to
some
...with
everyone
standing
around
...while
you
try
to
comfort
them.
Is
that
what
you
want,
Well,
not
me.
And
in
your
heart,
Carter,
We're
both
in
the
same
boat.
We
got
a
real
opportunity
here.
Opportunity?
That
is
real
twisted,
We
still
feel
good,
right?
Asymptomatic,

says.
The

see
it,

right.

kind

talk.
What
did
they
say?
Uh,
Mrs.
Chambers,
I'm
gonna
Excuse
me.
It's
not
good.
I
knew
we
should
have
gone
to
UCLA.
The
surgeons
are
better.

Wouldn't
have
mattered.
We're
not
giving
up.
Ah,

Yes,

no.
Let
me
handle
this.

Yes,

what

when
they
find
out

Given
up
on

I've
got
45
years
greased
up

that

think
I've
earned

not

I'm

And
I'm

I'm
gonna
jump

Wanna
get
it?
How
do
you
suggest
we
do
that?
Wait.
Ow!
Aah!
Damn
it.
Not
a
word.
Back
to
the
seat,
Kyle.
You'll
have
to
forgive
him,
Kyle.
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
wife.
Thirty
seconds
to
drop.
The
Sequel
was
like
that.
She
never
backed
me
up
on
anything.
The
Sequel?
The
second
Mrs.
Edward
Cole.
God,
that
woman
hated
me.
Maybe
because
you
called
her
Jeez,
Kyle,
-
Fifteen
seconds.
-
Wait!
Wait,
I
can't
do
this.
CARTER:
It's
not
the
jump
you're
afraid
of.
The
hell
it's
not!
You're
just
afraid
...and
you'll
show
up
at
No,
I'm
pretty
much
just
worried
No,
no!

Man's
got
some
lungs,
huh?
Let's
hit
the
silk!
Geronimo!
Oh,
yeah,
beautiful!

CARTER:
Pull
the
thing!
Pull
the
cord!
How
about
this,
huh?
This
is
living.
I
hate
your
rotten
guts.
Surrender
to
the
void!
Which
one
of
these
damn
cords
KYLE:
Don't
touch
it.
We're
not

INSTRUCTOR:

Pull
the
damn
cord!
I
was
in
love
once.
EDWARD:
How
lucky
for
me.
No
jokes,
Thomas,
remember
the
will.

Let
me
ask
you
something.
Uh,
is
it
Tommy
or
Thomas?
Um,
it's
actually
Matthew,
EDWARD:
Is
he
insane?
Depends.

So
you
decided?
No,
I
couldn't
think
of
anything
What's
permanently?
-
What?
So
no
Confederate
flag,
No,
I'm
gonna...
Pass.
Yeah,
sure.
Well,
I
never
agreed
You
worried
they
won't
bury
you
What,
the
wife?
It's
a
tattoo.
It's
not
like
you're
dumping
her
I
never
been
with
another
woman.
Whoa.
That's
gotta
be
on
the
list.
No,
no.
I
don't
think
so.
EDWARD:
Man,
oh,
man.
No.
Orgy's
not
even
being
unfaithful.
No.
It's
just,
like,
professional.
No!
I
don't
even
have
to
be
there.

CARTER:
-
You
gonna
drive
it
or
buy
it
a
dress?
Just
getting
to
know
each
other.
You
sure
we're
cleared
for
this?
Of
course
we're
cleared
for
it.
Just
checking.
Come
on!
Tap
it,
baby!
Ah,
we're
doing
just
fine.
You
sound
like
some
kid
You
sound
like
someone
looking
Ass-whupping?
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

You
got
nothing!
Got
enough
for
you,
Sunny
Jim,
Did
you
just
make
a
penis
reference?
What
if
I
did?
Jesus!
You're
gonna
kill
us
both!
What
if
I
do?
Goddamn
it!

You're
breaking
evil
on
me.
Evil?
I'll
show
you
evil.
I'll
show
you
Evel

Knievel.
Pick
up
on
this,

Yee-ha!

Chicken
man,
huh?
You
can
run,
but
you
cannot
hide!

What
do
you
wanna
do
next?

CARTER:
EDWARD:
...
that
it's
rude
CARTER:
Medicinal.
It's
indescribably
beautiful.
I
love
flying
over
the
polar
cap.
Above
the
desolation.
The
stars...
...it's
really
one
of
God's
good
ones.
So
you
think
a
being
You
don't?
You
mean,
do
I
believe
...and
promise
this
or
that...
...the
Biggie
will
make
all
this
No.
Then
95
percent
of
the
people
on
Earth
If
life
has
taught
me
anything...
...it's
that
95
percent
of
the
people
It's
called
faith.
I
honestly
envy
people
who
have
faith.
Maybe
your
head's
in
the
way.
Carter,
we've
all
had
hundreds
...and
every
one
of
them
Is
there
a
sugarplum
fairy
or
not?
And
nobody
has
ever
gotten
So,
what
do
you
believe?
I
resist
all
beliefs.
No
big
bang?
Random
universe?
We
live.
We
die.
And
the
wheels
on
the
bus
What
if
you're
wrong?
I'd
love
to
be
wrong.
If
I'm
wrong,
I
win.
I'm
not
sure
it
works
that
way.
Well,
you're
not
claiming
you
know
Mm-mm.
I
just
have
faith.
Hallelujah,
brother...
...and
pass
the
mustard.

CARTER:
Know
how
they
harvest
caviar?

a
female
sturgeon
is
caught...

has
to
take
great
care

Mm-hm.
...she
secretes

sour

Sounds
like
my
third
wife.

Woman
thought
mayonnaise
I
could
get
used
to
this.
Also
sounds
like
my
third
wife.
Thirty
years
I've
been
coming
here.
First
time
with
a
guy.
Well,
I'm
flattered.
Emily's
10th
birthday
Who's
Emily?
My
little,
uh...
Well,
she's
not
so
little
anymore.
You
have
a
daughter?
-
But
I
thought
you
said...
...I
didn't
know
you
then.
Make
a
long
story
short,
uh...
...I
don't
see
her.
CARTER:
What
are
you
doing?
It's
time.
-
No,
no,
no.
Cross
that
off.
-
Cross
it
off.
Why?
There
is
no
why.
-
What's
the
matter?
Where
you
going?

Just
like
a
broad.

Look,
uh,
Carter...
I'm
sorry.
I
know...
...sometimes
I
get

Jesus
Christ.
-
It's
all
right.
It's
okay.
The
top
on
the
catheter
came
loose,
Well,
maybe
we
should
get
you
-
I
just
busted
out
of
the
hospital.
It's
all
right.
Look,
it's
already
stopped,
It
looks
wonderful.

Maybe
I'll
get
the...
-
You
go
straight
to
the
car.
Okay,
all
right.
-
Where's...?
Where's
Tommy?
CARTER:
How
much
money
do
you
have?
Well,
I
wouldn't
bleed
on
the
rugs.

I'm
gonna
find
someplace
Be
as
good
as
new
afterwards.
Uh...
You...
Okay.

All
right,
it
took
some
doing,
Cairo
tomorrow,
Tanzania
for
two
days,
And,
as
previously
directed,
Thomas,
I'd
really
like
to
say
...but
I'd
be
lying.
And
I'd
really
like
to
say
you're

I,
too,
would
be
lying.
Turnabout
is
fair
play.
I

with

we
should
put

Come
on,
now,
I
told

No,
no,
it's
not
that.
It's
not
that.
It's
just,
I

if
you're
worried
...you
know,
it's
a

easier
for
me.
You
talked
to
Virginia,
didn't
you?

Why
do
you
think
I'm
doing
this?
Because
I
talked
you
into
it.
Edward,
you're
strong,
No.
After

CARTER:
...that
the
only

wish
I'd

You

technically...
...we
could
cross
off
two
items:
"See

...and
"witness

This
is
about
as
majestic
as
it
gets.
Wait
till
you
see

Oh,
yeah.
Your

Still,
this
ain't
half
bad.
You

the
ancient

had

Their

determined
whether

I'll

What
were
they?
Have
you
found
joy
in
your

Uh-huh.
Answer
the
question.

Me?
Answer
the
question,
Yes.
Has
your

brought
joy
to
others?
Ah,
this
type
of
question,
l...
I
don't
know,
uh...
I
don't
think
about
Ask
them.
I'm
asking
you.
Fine.
Fine.
Let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
After
the
breakup,
...Emily
went
to
live
with
her
mother.
You
know,
you
try
to
stay
close,
...phone
calls,
birthday
cards,
Anyway...
...Emily
goes
to
college,
joins
one
...the
animals,
whatnot...
...meets
a
guy,
decides
she
loves
him.
Good-looking
kid,
driven,
smart.
But
there
was
something
about
him...
...so
when
she
said
they
were
engaged
...but
being
my
daughter,
naturally...
...she
went
ahead
Needless
to
say,
That
must
have
hurt.
You
think?
First
time
he
hit
her,
she
came
to
me.
She
wouldn't
let
me.
Said
she
loved
him,
said
it
wasn't
...she
was
the
one
picked
the
fight.
Next
time
it
happened,
The
ex
told
me.
What
did
you
do?
What
any
father
would
do.
I
took
care
of
it.
I
called
a
guy
who
called
a

I
don't
know
what
he
said,
...all
I
know
is
he
didn't
kill
him...
...and
my
daughter
never
How
did
she
react?
Called
me
names
you
wouldn't
believe,
Said
I
was
dead
to
her.
I'm
not
proud
of
everything
I
did...
...but
I'm
pretty
sure
...so
if
they
don't
let
me
into

then
I
guess
that's

Do
they
still
make
those
coffins
Uh...
I
don't

they
do.
Then
cremated.
Do
you
bury
them,
scatter
them,
Float
them
down
the

if

feel
the
flames?
Well,
I
definitely
want

go

No.
Cremated.

corrected.

tried

go
up,

wasn't...

little
late
in

tell

terrible...

little
developed
in

certainly

I've
been
up
there,

know.

Really?
I
made
it
to
26,000
feet

Really?
What
was
it
like?
Cold...
-
Mm.
During
the
day,
There's
not
enough
air
But
at
night,
Seems
like
they're
just
out
of
reach,
They're
like
little
holes
-
Did
you
hear
it?
I
read
an
account
of
a
man
...and
standing
there
...he
experienced
It
was
like
all
sound
just
fell
away.
And
that's
when
he
heard
it.
What?
The
sound
of
the
mountain.
He
said
it
was
like
he
heard
I've
never
done
this
before.
That
sounds
like
such
a
clich...
...but
I
have
a
room
upstairs.
Well,
that's...
I
mean...
I...
I
appreciate
that.
But
you
see...
She's
a
very
lucky
woman.
Well,
I
rather
think
I'm
the
lucky
one.
Good
for
you.
Tom?
Three
things
to
remember
Never
pass
up
a
bathroom...
...never
waste
a
hard-on,
I'll
keep
that
in
mind
Heh-heh.
That's
a
good
one
there.
Let's
go
home.
Excuse
me?
I
want
to
go
home
now.
But
I
thought
that...
That
was
very
clever
of
you,
Edward.

How'd
you
know
I
didn't.
I'm
proud
of
you.
Nobody
cares
what
you
think.

Hey,

this
isn't

an
accident

Uh-huh.

are

Oh,
my
God.
He's
kept
tabs
on
her.
This
was
your
idea,
Tom?
No,
it
was
my
idea.

Yeah,
talked
him
into
it.
Wait
a
minute.

Edward?
Edward.
What
are
you
so
afraid
of?
Just
because
I
told
you
my
story
Oh.
Like
the
lady
in
the
bar?
-
That's
different.
-
Because
it
is!

have
no
fucking
idea

am!

gonna

angry...

VIRGINIA:
Ow!
Okay.

VIRGINIA:
Do
I
wanna
know?

VIRGINIA:

You
know,
I
feel
like
a
teenager.
Uh,
if
we
were
teenagers,
we
never
I
remember
the
first
time.
There
was
no
tiptoeing
around.
You
were
on
me
like...
that.
Carter?
Oh,
you
playing
hide-and-seek
Carter!

Mr.
Cole?
Mr.
Cole?
You
ever
read
The
Divine
Comedy?
Excuse
me,
sir?
The
Divine
Comedy,
Maybe
we
should
take
a
break.
We
don't
need
a
break.
I'm
in
remission.
I'm
simply
asking...
...if
you
ever
read
The
Divine
Comedy.
Sir,
you
have
a
phone
call.
Tommy,
not
now.
I
really
think
you
should
take
this.

Uh...
Hey,
Edward.
What's
the
prognosis?
It's
metastasized
to
his
brain.
Metast...
Operable?
The
odds
aren't
what
Odds.
Jesus.
How's
he
doing?
He's
doing
okay.
Uh,
he
wanted
me
to
give
you
this.
I
was
supposed
to
wait
until
after...
...but
then
I
thought...
She
never
listened
to
me
before.
Why
change
a
winning
formula?

You
look
like
shit,
Ray.
Thanks.
How
they
treating
you?
Pea
soup
still
sucks.
I'll
have
a
word
with
the
owner.
You
do
that.
Can
I
have
some
water?
You
can't
have
water,
but
I'll
get
you
CARTER:
You
still
drinking
that
fancy
coffee?
What?
What
are
you,
obsessed?

Read
it.

You're
shitting
me.
Cats
beat
me
to
it.

You
got
a
pen?
Give
me
a
pen.
What?
Here.
It's
not
finished.
Well...
It's
not
a
one-man
deal.
I'm
afraid
it'll
have
to
be.
We're
ready.
I'll
be
here
when
you
get
back.
Sounds
good
to
me.
CARTER:
Dear
Edward,
I've
gone
...
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
In
the
end,
I
realized
...
so
here
goes.
I
know
the
last
time
...
we
weren't
exactly
hitting
It
certainly
wasn't
the
way
I
suppose
I'm
responsible,
But,
in
all
honesty,
Virginia
said
I
left
a
stranger
I
owe
that
to
you.
There's
no
way
I
can
repay
you
...
so
rather
than
try,
I'm
Just
going
to
Find
the
Joy
in
your
life.
You
once
said
you're
not
everyone.
Well,
that's
true.
You're
certainly
not
everyone.
But
everyone
is
everyone.
My
pastor
always
says:
"
Our
lives
are
streams...
...
flowing
into
the
same
river...
...
towards
whatever
heaven
lies
Hello,
sweetie.
Hi.
CARTER:
My
dear
friend...
...
close
your
eyes
Good
afternoon.
I
don't
know
what
most
people
say
...in
all
honesty,
I...
I've
tried
to
avoid
them.
The
simplest
thing
is...
...I
loved
him
and
I
miss
him.
Carter
and
I
saw
the
world
together.
Which
is
amazing...
...when
you
think
that
only
...we
were
complete
strangers.
I
hope...
...that
it
doesn't
sound
...but
the
last
months
of
his
life...
...were
the
best
months
of
mine.
He
saved
my
life.
And
he
knew
it
before
I
did.
EDWARD:
...
found
it
worth
his
while
In
the
end...
...
I
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
we
brought
So,
one
day,
when...
...
I
go
to
some
final
resting
place...
...
if
I
happen
to
wake
up
...
I
hope
that
Carter's
there...
...
to
vouch
for
me...
...
and
show
me
the
ropes
CARTER:
It
was
a
Sunday,
in
the
afternoon...
...
and
there
wasn't
a
cloud
in
the
sky.
He
was
81
years
old.
Even
now,
I
can't
claim
to
understand
But
I
can
tell
you
this:
I
know
that
when
he
died,
...
and
his
heart
was
open.
And
I'm
pretty
sure
he
was
happy
...
because
he
was
buried
...
and
that
was
against
the
law.
