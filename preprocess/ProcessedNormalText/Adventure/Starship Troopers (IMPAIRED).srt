my

is
violence...
the
supreme

from
which
Uh,

mother
always
said
Really?
I
wonder
what
the

They
probably
wouldn't
say
anything.
Correct.
Naked
force
throughout
history
The
contrary
opinion,
is
wishful
thinking
People
who
forget
that
Rico,
what's
the
moral
difference,
between
a

A

defending
it
with
his

does
not.
But
do
you
understand
it?

I
don't
know.
I
doubt

I'm
not
in
any

Sorry,

Roughnecks,
let's
move.
All
right.

Aaaaaah!
Why
didn't
they
kill
us?
They
want
us
alive.
We
should
go
this
way.
"A"
company's
that
way.
Yeah...
but
Carmen's
down
there.
Hey,
I
hate
to
be
rude,
buddy...
but
word
has
it
she's
dead.
-
She's
still
alive.
I
don't
know
how
I
know,
but
I
know.
Listen,
you
got
command,
that's
a
serious
offence.
Yeah.
I
think
Roughneck
Two-Zero,
I
need
two
volunteers.


Aaah!

One
day...
someone
like
me...
is
gonna
kill
you...
and
your
whole
fucking
race.
Aaaah!




Aaaaah!

You
know
what
this
is?

This
is
Roughneck
Two-Zero.
Brain

What's
goin'
on?

What's
it
thinking,
Colonel?


It's
afraid.
-
It's
afraid!

Whoo!

Well,
look
who's
here.
It
was
you,
wasn't
it?
Well,
that's
classified.
You
know,
whenever
the
three
of
us
I
feel
like
things
I
hope
you're
right,
Carmen.
We've
got
one
of
their
Brains
now.
Pretty
soon
we'll
know
how
they
think,
One
day
it
will
all
be
over...
and
everyone
will
forget
This

it
turned.
And
it
wasn't
the
mighty
Fleet.

It
was
a
drill
instructor
named
Zim
Come

Come

Zim.
He
got
him!
Yeah!
Zim!
Zim
got
the
Bug!
-
Good
job,
Sergeant.
That'd
be
Private,
sir.
Carry
on,
Private.
-
Yes,
sir!

What
mysteries
Federal
scientists
are
working
-

Once
we
understand
the
Bug,

We
have
the
ships.
We
have
the
weapons.
We
need
soldiers.
Soldiers
like
Over
the
target
area
now,
Captain.

This
is
the
captain
speaking.

Come
on,
you
apes!
