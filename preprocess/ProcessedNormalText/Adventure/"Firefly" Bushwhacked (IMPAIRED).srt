Over
here!

Yeah!
Too
tall!
Too
tall!
-
Jayne!

-
Ah!

Shoot
it.

Right
behind
you--
Yeah!

Hello.
Who's
winning?
I
can't
really
tell.
They
don't
seem
to
be
playing
Well,
we're
pretty
far

She's
good.
Better.
She
has
her
days...
and
she
still
won't
talk
about
what
it
was

Open!
Aah!
Good
eye!
Good
eye!
She
dreams
about
it.
-
Nightmares.
And
now,
on
the
run,
I
don't
know
if
I'll
be
able
to
Simon,
you
are.
Leaving
your
whole
world
behind?
That's
incredibly
selfless.
-

Nice.
-
Well,
we're
all
running
-

We
must
be
coming
up
Oh,
my
God.
We're
all
doomed!
Oh,
right.
Uh,
back
to
work.
-
That
makes
us
one
man
short.
Ow!
Hey!
Say,
Doc,
why
don't
you
come
on
down,
Inara
won't
mind.

Aah!
Wash,
you
have
a
stroke
-
Near
enough.
-

I've
been
hailing
her,
but
if
whoever's
there
I
can't
imagine
anybody's
Bring
us
in
a
little
closer.
Get
you
close
enough
What
is
it?
It's
a
ghost.

Families?
I
figure
that
fella
we
run
into
Killed
'em
all.
Then
he
decided
to
take
a
swim,
see
how
You're
a
very
"up"
person.
-
Shouldn't
we
report
this?
Right.
They're
gonna
run
Then
we'll
have
to.
If
there's

It's

There's

All

How's
about

just
say
a

Shall
I
remind
you
of
the
story
I'd
rather
you
didn't.
Could
be

no
one's
gonna
mind
if
we
see
if
there's
not
Yeah--
No,
uh,

Where
do
you
think
you're
headed?
Thought
I'd
offer
my
services...
in
case
anyone
on
board
Well,
the
captain
and
Zoe
We'll
holler
if
we
need
ya.
-
Somethin'
wrong?
Oh.
No.
No,
I--
Well,
I
suppose
it's
just
the
thought
being
the
only
thing
nothing.
It's
impressive
what
"nothing"

that
feller
we
bumped
into.

They're
just--
Sir.
Personal

-

It's
okay.

Bad

I--
I

there
is

Hey.
Grab

found

Didn't
say.
Right.
Uh,
I-I'll
ask
Inara
Whatever.
I
ain't
waitin'.
I'll
meet
you
over
there.
But
don't

-


Hi.


Um,
what
are
you
doing
here?


All
right,
enough.
As
long
as
you're
here,
you
may
as
well
Let's
be
quick
about
this.
Where
are
all
the
people?
Ship
says
lifeboat
launched
We're
gonna
assume
Anyway,
we're
just
here
to
pick
the
Jayne,
you
take
the
galley.
You,
um,
have
this
on
wrong.

Sir,
I
count
16
families
signed
on.
Lifeboat
wouldn't
hold
a
third
of
that.
I
know.
Think
I
found
something
Seems
to
me
any
valuables,
would
likely
be
stored
C-Deck,
aft.
Good
work.
Keep
the
engine
running.
River?
It's
Inara.
Are
you
hungry,
sweetie?
River?

About
what?
Well,
what
happened
here.
I
mean,
why
would
anybody
abandon
their
ship
For
all
sorts
of
reasons.
-
What?
Not
that
I
can
see,
anyhow.
Whoo.
Well,
there's
a
good
one.

This
looks
to
be
it.

Locked.
Well,
now,
I'd
say

Gen-seed,
protein,
Everything
a
growing
family
needs...
to
make
a
fresh
start
on
a
new
world.
Hard
subsidies
for
14-plus
families.
-
That's--
Forget
the
rest.
Gonna
need
a
hand
Sir,
even
on
a
lifeboat...
you'd
think
those
who
escaped


Nobody.
My
God.

I
know
what
did
this.
Get
her
out
of
here.

Jayne,
drop
what
you're
doing
Take
Kaylee
and
the
doctor


Captain?
Captain.
Zoe!
Came
from
above,
sir.
The
galley.
-
What?
River,
what
are
you--
I
followed
the
voices.
-
Don't
ever
leave
the
ship.
Not
ever.
-

What'd
you
see?

Came
at
me
from
behind.
Strong.
-
I
think
I
might
have
hit
him.


No
one's
gonna
hurt
you.
-
No.
No
mercy.
No.
-
No
mercy.
We
got
lots
and
lots
of--


He's
a
real
beast.
It's
a
wonder
you're
still
alive.
Looked
bigger
I
wonder
how
long
Don't
know.
He
must
be
real
brave
to
survive

Yeah.
Real
hero,

What?
We
don't,
do
we?
Captain
wouldn't
have
brought
him

Blood
pressure's
high
side
of
normal--
Weak.
They
were
all
weak.
Other
than
the
bullet
wound,
there
Though
that
crack
to
the
head
you
gave

Cattle
for
the
slaughter.
Dope
him.
-
I
don't
think
that--
No
mercy.
No
resistance.

-

Open
up.


So?
How's
our
patient?
Uh,
aside
from
he's
in
remarkably
good
health.
So
he'll
live,
then?
Which,
to
my
mind,
is
unfortunate.
Not
a
very
charitable
-
Charity'd
be
putting
a
bullet
in
his
brainpan.
It'd
save
him
the
suffering.
All
right.
No
one
goes
in
here.
Nothing
more
we
can
do
for
him,
-
What
do
you
mean?
-
Reavers?


It
was
that
other
fella,
Like
I
said
before,
he
went
stir
crazy,
-
Just
a
second
ago,
you
said--
Wasn't
reavers.
Strictly
speaking,
What
are
you
suggesting?
Don't
matter
we
took
him
It's
the
place
he's
gonna
live
I
don't
accept
that.
Whatever
horror
he
witnessed,
it
was
done
by
men,
-
Reavers
ain't
men.
Too
long
removed
from
civilization,
And
I
believe
there's
a
power
A
power
that
heals.
Reavers
might
take
issue
if
they
had
a
philosophy...
and
if
they
weren't
too
busy
Jayne's
right.
Or
they
forgot
how
to
be.
They
got
out
to
the
edge
of
the
galaxy,
and
that's
what
they
became.
Why
are
we
still
sittin'
here?
Work
ain't
done.
Still
substantial
Oh,
I
ain't
goin'
over
there
No
ruttin'
way.
Jayne,
you'll
scare
the
women.

-
I've
dealt
with
bodies.
They
don't
worry
me.
Maybe
see
what
I
can
do
Those
folks
are
already
restin'
pretty
How
we
treat
our
dead
than
those
did
the
slaughtering.
All
right.
Jayne,
you'll
help
the
doctor
-
Then
you'll
load
up
the
cargo.
We're
sittin'
put
for
a
funeral?
Yes,
Jayne,
that
is
exactly
Not
gonna
have
these
people
lookin'
I
ain't
sayin'
but
on
the
off
chance
there
is,
Just
when
I
think
That
was
real
pretty,
Captain,
Didn't
think
you
were
one
I'm
not.
But
I
figure
it'll
keep
No
reason
to
concern
them
Sir?
Sir?

It's
a
real
burden
-
What
is
that?
Reavers
sometimes
leave
'em
-
Triggered
it
when
we
latched
on.
It
blows.
Okay,
so
we
don't
detach.
What,
reavers
come
back?
Looks
like
they've
jerry-rigged
it
It's
the
only
thing
that'd
work
We
could
probably
bypass
that
easy,
You
tell
me
right
now,
little
Kaylee.
Sure.
Yeah.
I
think
so.
Besides,
if
I
mess
up,
it's
not
like

No.
No!

No
mercy.

Aah!
Aah!
-
Ohh!

-


What's
goin'
on?
Well,
right
at
this
particular
moment,
-
Right?
Looked
like
a
thing
to
me.
Thought
we
might
have
had
a
situation,
Let's
get
that
merchandise
put
away.
Everyone's
home,
Wash.

No,
no,
don't
you
say
that.
-
The
gorram
reavers
come
back.
-
Like
it's
gonna
matter!

Reavers?

you
are
ordered
to
release
Prepare
to
dock
Looks
like
civilization

No
mandatory
registration
markings
Make
sure
we
cite
them
for
that.
Sir,
we've
identified
the
transport
ship
It
was
licensed
to
a
group
of
families
They
were
due
to
touch
down
in
Newhall
Once
we
secure
these
vultures,
Sir,
didn't
we
have
a
flag
Check.
Oh,
here
it
is.
An
alert
issued
believed
to
be
carrying
two
fugitives--
What
are
they
wanted
for?
It's
not
available.
Forty
thousand
of
these
old
wrecks
Well,
I'm
not
about
to
have
We
run
into
these
two,
Brass
can
sort
it
out
later.
-
So
what
was
it?
-
I
just
got
done
putting
it
in.
-
Why
for?
In
about
two
minutes,
this
boat's
No.
-
We've
gotta
run.
If
they
find
us,
they'll
send
River
back
I'd
never
see
her
again.
Stack
everything
in
plain
sight.
Wouldn't
want
Might
give
them
Alliance
boys
-
Or
the
right
one.
-
Now,
go
fetch
your
sister.
Why?
Are
you
gonna
put
her
Don't
get
touchy.
Is
that
why
you
let
us
stay,
so
you
-
Knew
there
was
a
reason.
Don't
be
a
fool,
son.
Do
as
the
man
says.
Well,
quite
a
lot
of
fuss.
If
I
didn't
know
better,
-
Is
this
your
vessel?
-
And
is
this
everyone,
Captain?
Though
in
our
infirmary,you're
gonna
find
Saved
him,
guess
you
could
say.
Mmm.
Straight
to
the
back,
And
these
items,

Looks
to
me
like
It
does?
That's
discouraging.
Alliance
property
too.
But
that
is
a
wrist
slap
compared
A
brother
and
sister.
When
I
search
No
children
on
this
boat.
Mmm.
I
didn't
say
children.
Siblings.
Adult
siblings.
-
I
misunderstood.
No
chance
No
one
would
blame
you
I
know
how
these
older-model
Fireflies
Do
they?
Smugglers
and
the
like
tend
to

We
will
continue
this
conversation
I
want
every
inch
-
"Junker"?
But,
Captain,
did
you
hear


-

You
are
a
Companion.
And
you
were
based
for
years
It's
only
in
the
last
year
that
you've
It's
just
Serenity,
In
a
few
weeks
-
Why
is
this
important?
It's
a,
uh--
It's
a
curiosity...
a
woman
of
stature
falling
in
with...
these
types.
Not
in
the
least.
It's
a
mutually
I
rent
the
shuttle
from
Capt.
Reynolds,
and
the
captain
finds
that
opens
certain
doors
that
might
-
And
do
you
love
him?
-
Well,
he
is
your
husband.
You
two
met
Captain
was
looking
for
a
pilot.
Seemed
to
work
out.
-
You
fought
with
Reynolds
in
the
war?
-
And
your
husband.
Is
there
any
particular
reason
Don't
see
that
it's
We're
very
private
people.


Oh,
yeah.
You
can
put
that
down.
Her
legs,
and
right
where
her
legs
meet
That,
and
above
it.
Six
gerstlers
crammed
so
that
you
strain
and
you
end
up
having
to
recycle
secondary
just
so's
you
don't
end
up
pumping
it
and
asphyxiating
the
entire
crew.
Now,
that's
junk.
Have
you
seen
what
she
wears?
Have
you
ever
been
Pirates.
Pirates
with
their
own
chaplain.
There's
an
oddity.
Not
the
only
oddity
where
things
aren't
always
so
plain
Rules
can
be
a
mite
fuzzier.
These
fugitives
that
we're
looking
for--
-
They
were
last
seen
on
Persephone.
They
also
left
port
aboard
just
about
the
same
time
Well,
Persephone's
a
big
place.
Yes.
Yes,
it
is.
And
if
anyone's
hiding
we
will
find
them.
So,
I
figure
by
now
you
been
over
Yes.
Terrible
thing.
If
you
want
my
advice,
Just
fire
the
whole
gorram
thing
That
ship
is
evidence.
I'm
not
in
Course
not.
I'm
gonna
make
a
leap
here...
and
figure
this
is
your
first
tour

It's
a
very
loyal
crew
But
then,
I
can
tell
by
your
record...
you
have
a--
a
tendency
to
inspire
It's
not
sergeant.
For
some,
the
war'll
never
be
over.
I
notice
your
ship's
called
Serenity.
You
were
stationed
on
Hara
Battle
of
Serenity
Valley
I
believe
you
might
be
right.
Independents
suffered
Some
say
that
after
Serenity
that
the
war
ended
in
that
valley.
Hmm.
Seems
odd
you'd
name
your
ship
after
May
have
been
the
losing
side.
Is
that
why
you
attacked
-
What?
Only
those
weren't
soldiers
They
were
civilians,
families,
trying
to
make
a
new
life,
So
we
attacked
that
ship,
then
brought
Is
that
what
we
did?
I'd
ask
him...
only
I'm
not
sure
he'll
be
able
to
speak

I
haven't
seen
well,
since
the
war.
-
I
should
have
known.
Formal
charges
will
be
transmitted
Commander,
I'm
not
what
you
need
Things
go
the
way
they
are,
-
Get
him
down!
Let's
start
the
pressure.
Get
a
line
in.
Go.
-
All
right.

Reavers?
That
is
what
I
said.
You
can't
imagine
how
many
times
Reavers
did
it.
-
It's
the
truth.
-
Wouldn't
be
sittin'
here
talkin'
to
you
if
I
had.
I'll
tell
you
who
did--
He
looked
right
into
the
face
of
it
-
It.
The
kind
of
darkness
Blacker
than
the
space
Very
poetic.
They
made
him
watch.
He
probably
tried
to
turn
away.
You
call
him
a
survivor.
A
man
comes
up
against
the
only
way
to
deal
with
it,
He's
following
First
he'll
try
to
Cut
on
himself,
And
then...
he'll
start
actin'
like
one.
-

Let's
have
two
M.P.s
up
here
to
escort
Let's
go
again.
Later...
maybe.
The
captain
said
we
should
lay
low
in
the
shuttle.
-
Come
on.
Yes.
Yes,
of
course
he
is.
Your
ship
and
its
contents
The
proceeds
of
the
sale
will
be
applied

Get
him
out
of
here.
Go
to
full
lockdown.
It
won't
matter.
You
won't
find
him.
Wait,
no.
Don't.
Don't.
River,
it's
okay.
Wait.
Wait...
here.
They've
gone.
Come
on.
-
Don't--

No.
-
Come
on.
Don't--
You
don't
have
to
be
afraid.
Why
would
he
come
back
here?
Looking
for
familiar
ground.
All
right,
let's
get
him
to
the
brig.
-
No,
no,
no.
I
should
go
with
you.
How
many
more
men
you
feel
Nobody
knows
Serenity
like
I
do.
We
let
him
go
first.
Right.
You
want
to,
uh--
Thanks.
Now
I'll
really
We
don't
know
how
long
it's
going
to
be.
I'm
just
gonna
grab
some
food--
-

-




You
save
his
gorram
life.

He
had
to.
Wouldn't
be
civilized.
Grr!
Arrgh!
