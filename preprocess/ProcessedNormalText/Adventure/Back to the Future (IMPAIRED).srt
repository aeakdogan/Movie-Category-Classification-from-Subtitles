Thanks

much.
You

Then
who's
vice
president?
Jerry
Lewis?

Jane
Wyman

the
First

And
Jack
Benny
is

secretary.
MARTY:
Listen
to
me.
l've
had
enough
jokes
for
one
evening.
MARTY:
No,

Doc.
MARTY:
The
bruise
on
your
head.
You
were
standing
on
your
toilet
...and
you
fell
That's
when
you
got
the
idea
...is
what
makes

travel
possible.

MARTY:
There's
something
wrong
with

After
l
fell
off
my
toilet...
...I
drew
this.
MARTY:
The
flux
capacitor.

something
that

You

Of

up.
This

What

1.21
gigawatts.

Great
Scott!
What
the

going
to

be
done,
can
it?
MARTY:
Doc,
look.
DOC:
l'm
sure
that
in
1985
plutonium
is
...but
in
1955,
it's
a
little
hard
to
come
by.
Marty,
l'm
sorry,
Doc,
stuck
here?
l
can't
be
stuck
here.
l
got
a
life
in
1985.
-l
got
a
girl.
Doc,
she's
beautiful.
She's
crazy
about
me.
Look
at
this.
Look
whatshe

here.
Thatsays
it
all.
Doc,
you're
my
only
hope.
Marty,
l'm
sorry,
but

only
power

...1.21
gigawatts
of
electricity
MARTY:
What
did
you
say?
Unfortunately,
you
never
know
We
do
now.
This
is
it!
This
is
the
answer.
lt
says
here
that
a
bolt
of
lightning...
...is
going
to
strike
the
clock
tower
lf
we
could
somehow
harness
...channel
it
into
the

capacitor...
...itjust
might
work.
Next
Saturday
night
All
right.
Saturday's
good.
l

spend
a
week
in
1955.
That
is
out
of
the
question.
You
must
not

or
talk
to
anybody.
Anything
you
do
can
have
repercussions
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay.
Marty...
...have
you

Great
Scott!
Let
me
see
that
photograph
Just
as
l
thought.
This
proves
my
theory.
MARTY:
Erased
from
existence.
They
really
cleaned
this
place
up.
DOC:
According
to
my
theory,
you
interfered
lf
they
don't
meet,
they
won't
fall
in
love,
That's
why
your
brother's
disappearing.
Your
sister
will
follow,
and
unless
MARTY:
Sounds
heavy.
Which
one's
your
pop?

That's
him.
Okay.
Okay,
you
guys.

Very
funny.
Maybe
you
were
adopted.
GEORGE:
Okay,
real
mature,
guys.
GEORGE:
Okay,
pick
up
my
books.
That's
Strickland.
Jesus,
didn't
that
guy
ever
have
hair?
Shape
up,
man.
You're
a
slacker.
Do
you
want
to
be
a
slacker
No.
-What
did
your
mother
see
in
him?
l
guess
she
felt
sorry
for
him
He
hit
me
with
the
car.
That's
the
Florence
Nightingale
effect.

happens
in
hospitals

Go
to
it,
kid.
George,
buddy.
l

been
looking
all
over
for
you.
You
remember
me,
-Yeah.
Lorraine?
Calvin!
l'd
like
you
to
meet
Hi.
lt's
really
a
pleasure
to
meet
you.
-How's
your
head?
l've
been
worried
about
you
Are
you
okay?

-l'm
sorry.
l
have
to
go.
lsn't
he
a
dreamboat?
-She
didn't
even
look
at
him.
Your
mother
is
infatuated
with
you
Wait
a
minute,
Doc.
Are
you
trying
to
tell
me
-Precisely.
There's
that
word
again.
''Heavy.''
Why
are
things
so
heavy
in
the
future?
The
only
way
we're
going
to
You've
got
to
get
them
to
interact...
...in
some
sort
of
social....
-You
mean
like
a
date?
What
kind
of
date?
They're
your
parents.
What
are
their
common
interests?
Nothing.

never
let
anybody

my
stories.
MARTY:
Why
not?
What
if
they
didn't
like
them?
l
guess
that
would
be
pretty
hard
No.
No,
not
hard
at
all.
So
anyway,
George.
About
Lorraine.
She
really
likes
you.
She
told
me
to

Right

Hi,

lf
l
know
too
much
...just
as
you've
endangered
yours.
You're
right.
Let
me
show
you
my
plan
Please
excuse
the
crudity
of
this
model.
l
didn't
have
time
to
build
it
to
scale
-lt's
good.
We
run
industrial-strength
electrical
cable
...down,
suspending
it
over
the
street
Meanwhile,
we've
outfitted
the
time
...which
runs
directly
At
the
calculated
moment...
...you
start
off
from
down
the
street...
...driving
directly
toward
the
cable,
According
to
the
flyer,

precisely
...lightning

strike

tower,
...as
the
connecting
hook
makes
contact...
...thereby
sending
1.21
gigawatts
...and
sending
you
back
to
1985.

All
right,
now.
Watch
this.

the
lightning.


Ready.
Set.
Release.



MARTY:
You're
instilling
me
Don't
worry.
l'll
take
care
of
ideas.
By
the
way...
...what
happened
today?
Did
he
ask
her
out?
-l
think
so.

lt's
your
mom!
She's
tracked
you
down!
Hi,
Cal....
Marty.
MARTY:
Lorraine.
How
did
you
know
l
was
here?
l
followed
you.
This
is
my
doc....
My
uncle...
...Doc
Brown.
-Hi.
LORRAlNE:
...but
l
was
kind
of
wondering...
...if
you'd
ask
me
to
the...
...Enchantment
Under
the
Sea
dance
You
mean....
You
mean
nobody's
asked
you?
LORRAlNE:
No.
Not
yet.
-What
about
George?
He's
kind
of
cute
and
all,
but
not....
Well....
l
think
a
man
should
be
strong...
...so
he
can
stand
up
for
himself...
...and
protect
the
woman
he
loves.
Don't
you?
Yeah.
l
still
don't
understand.
How
am
l
supposed
to
...if
she's
already
going
Well,
because,
George,
She
just
doesn't
know
it
yet.
That's
why
we
got
to
show
her
You're
somebody
who
stands
up
Yeah,
but
l've
never
picked
a
fight
Look,
you're
not
going
Dad-dad-daddy-o.
You're
coming
to
her
rescue,
right?
Let's
go
over
the
plan
again.
l'm
going
to
be
at
the
dance.
-And
where
am
l
going
to
be?
Right
around
9:00,
Why
is
she
going
to
get
angry
with
you?
Well,
because,
George,
nice
girls
get
angry

-You're
going
to
go
touch
her
on
her--
lt's
just
an
act,
right?
So,
9:00,
you're
strolling
You
see
us
struggling
in
the
car.
You
walk
up,
you
open
the
door,
Your
line,
George.

Hey,
you,
get
your
damn
hands
off
her!
-You
really
think
l
ought
to
swear?
Goddamn
it,
George,
swear.
Okay.
So
now
you
come
up.
l'm
out
for
the
count,
right?
And
you
and
Lorraine
You
make
it
sound
so
easy.
l
just....
l
wish
l
wasn't
so
scared.
There's
nothing
to
be
scared
of.
You
know,
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it...
...you
can
accomplish
anything.
