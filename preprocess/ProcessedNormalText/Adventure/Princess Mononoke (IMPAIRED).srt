Come
on,
boy.

Girls!
There's
something
strange
going
on.
The

woman
wants
everybody
back

We
just
came
from
Ji-san.
Yes,
in
the
forest.
-
The
birds
have
gone.
I'll
go
to
the
watchtower
You

hurry
back
home
All
right.
Huh?

Something's
there.
-
Ji-san,
did
you
see
it
too?
The
wise
woman's
calling
everybody
There.
Look.
-
It's
some
kind
of
demon!

Run,
Yakul!
Run!

It's
headed
for
the
village.
Prince
Ashitaka,
wait!
That
thing
is
cursed!
Here,
Yakul!
Calm
your
fury,
o
mighty
lord!
Whatever
you
may
be,
god

The

Go

Please!
Stop!

Are
you
all

-
Kaya,
don't
touch
it.
-
Where
is
the
wise
woman?
You
must
keep
away
from
him,
all
of
you.
-
What
shall
we
do?
-
All
right.

O
nameless
god
I
bow
before
you.
A
mound
will
be
raised
and
Pass
on
in
peace
Disgusting
little
creatures,
soon
all
of

I'm
afraid
this
is
very
bad.
The

me
the

He
had

kind
of
poison
inside
him,
a
poisonous
hatred
that
consumed
and
turned

My
prince,
are
you

Yes,
I
was

Mmm.
The

However,
you

Look
at
this.
This

This
is
what
hurt
him

It
shattered
his
bones

This
is
what
turned

There
is
evil

It's
your
fate
to

Ashitaka!
Do

I
came
to
give
you
this
so
you

Please,
keep

You

No.
A
massacre.
Where
are
you
going?

It's
a
warrior!

You!
Stop!

My
arm!
What's
happening
to
me?
Hurry!
Stop

A
demon.

The

Who's
that?
Are
you
selling
soup

There
he
is
now.

-
Will
this
be
enough?
This
isn't
money.
-
Excuse
me,
but
might
I
inspect
that?
Mmm?
My
God!
But
this
is
a
lump
of
pure
gold,
However,
if
it's
money
you
want,
What
do
ya
say?
My
good
people,
is
there
No?
All
right.
Now,
I'm
just
a
monk,
That's
right,
maybe
even
more.
Where
are
you
going?
Hey!
You
can't
We've
only
just
met.
We
have
got
your
rice,
You're
a
man
of
few
words.
Don't
you
even
think
of
thanking
me.
In
fact,
I
should
be
You
see,
I
was
caught
in
that
battle.
You
fight
like
a
demon.
I
see
you
noticed
That's
what
we
get
for
waving
that
They'll
wait

we're

then...
See
this
place
here?
When
I
came
here
last,
a
few
years
back,
But
then
there
must
have
been
The
only
sure
thing
These
days,
there
are
dead
from
wars,
And
nobody
cares.
So
you
say
you're
under
a
curse?

Mmm!
Ahh!
I
was
wrong
to
fight
in
that
village.
Samurai
thugs.
Hand

Of

Don't
worry.
Anyway,
I've
got
Have
you
ever
come
across
Never
have.
It
came
from
the
giant
boar.
I'm
sure
it
was

little
ball
of
iron

There's
a
place

in
the
mountains
It's
where

I've

friend.
Mmm.

Hyah!
Move!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Come
on!
Push

The

Coming
this

Wolves!

Don't
let
the
oxen
panic!
Stay
calm!
Keep
your
powder
dry.

-
Ready!
And
fire!
-
They're
getting
away!

-

Second
round!
Fire!
That
was
it?
They're
just
pups.

Where
are
they?
It's
Moro!

Come
on.

Ha,
ha!
You
forget
she
is
a
god.

-
She
certainly
did
some
damage.
What
about
the
men
They're
dead.

He's
still
breathing.
Hang
on.
Huh?



My

is
Ashitaka!
I

No,

Look!
Reinforcements!
We're
doomed!
Oh,
no!
If
Yakul's
not
afraid,
then
we
have
Would
you
be
kind
enough

Sir,
I
really
think
I
wonder,
did
I
mention
There's
a
lovely
trail
The
current's
too
swift
and
your
friend's
injuries
If
we
don't
get
him
back
soon,
Hey,
little
fellow,

Please,
sir,
I'm
really
Oh,
my
God!

Look
at
that.


Oh.
This
place
is
magical.
The
tracks
of
those
wolves
This
place
must
be
where
Sir,
I
think
maybe
we
took
This
is
a
place
I
think
we're
safe.
More
tracks?
Whatever
made
these



Sir!
What's
going
on?





Uh,
sir,
what
You
went
white
as
a
sheet
-
I
warned
you
about
this
place.
-
Did
you
see
anything
just
then?
Forget
it.
Hang
on
just
a
little
longer.
I
failed
her.
It's
gone,
whatever
it
was.

That's
strange.
My
arm!
It's
healed!




It's
a
fortress.
It's
Lady
Eboshi's
Irontown.
We
make
Hey,
there!
-
Look
there!
-
Someone's
come
out
of
the
woods.
Look!
It's
me!
-
It's
Kohroku!
He's
alive!
-
It's
true!
Kohroku's
still
alive!
Quiet!
Stop
that
noise!
I'm
trying
to
tally
these
accounts
here,
-
Haven't
you
heard?
Kohroku's

-
There
they
are!
-
That's
it.
-
This
is
unbelievable.
-
Yes,
is
my
son
with
you?

It's
never
the
guards
that
die.
Stand
aside.
That
man
in
the
weird
costume,
sir?
He's
obviously
an
outsider.
-
Be
careful.
This
stranger
saved
our
lives.
You
should
be
grateful
to
him.
-


I'm
very
grateful
for
you
bringing
but
something
You
got
back
almost
as
fast
as
we
did
On
top
of
that,
you
did
it
-
and
you
want
me
-
You're
alive!
-

That's
just
great!
-
But,
my
little
flower...
Don't
you
"little
flower"
me.
Then
maybe
I
could
have
Sweetness,
can

Toki,
save
your
sweet
nothings
And
as
for
you,
Gonza,
a
fine
always
strutting
and
You
never
do
a
lick
That's
unfair
and
untrue.
Thanks,
stranger.
That's
a
relief.
I
was
starting

Say,
why
don't
you
take
the
mask
off?

Gonza?
Bring
the
stranger
I
would
like
-
Kohroku.
-
I'm
happy
you're
back,
and
I
apologize.
Uh-oh,
milady,
you
really
shouldn't
If
you're
too
nice
to
him,
I
hope
you'll
forgive
me,
too,
Toki.
Oh,
that's
all
right.
Milady,
the
wolves
would
have
eaten
Get
some
rest,
traveller.
Oh,
hey!
You're
not
handsome,


-
Pull!

Here!
You
know,
they
had
to
fight
off
Just
dish
it
out!
-

-
Where
is
he?
Toki
was
right.
-
Yeah,
not
bad.
-
That
never
stopped
you
before.
Quiet
out
there!
Yeah,
there's
lots
of
I've
seen
cattle
Listen,
stranger.
You
don't
want
to
stay
Look,
woman!
We
risked
our
lives
you're
all
eating
tonight,
And
who
made
the
iron
that
paid
Yeah,
we're
pumping
those
bellows
Actually,
if
it's
not
too
much
-
You
would?
Lend
me
your
lipstick.

Don't
be
a
stranger.
We'll
be
waiting
for
you.
It's

Happy?
Ha!
Women
like
that...
It's
a
disgrace.
Lady
Eboshi

around
Milady

a
kind
heart,
You
got
rice
It's
true.
Everything
here
has
turned
That's
right.
She's
not
even
afraid
You
should
have
seen
the
way
she
dealt

Who's
Nago?
He
used
to
rule
We
couldn't
even
get
near
the
mountains
Nothing
to
do
but
sit
around
starin'
at
a
bunch
Mm-hmm.
See,
the
iron

the
sand
Then
we
tried
to
get
at

iron
The
problem
was,
before

that's
what

feeling
no

Then
one
day
Lady
Eboshi
came
along

Young
man,
what's
wrong?
Is
something
No,
I
was
just
thinking
I
was
thinking
how
he

Forgive
me
for
keeping
you
That's
good

question
What

To

That
explains
it.
Come.
I'll

her
off

Keep

A

Toki,
she's

Good
luck,
stranger.


Stop

Leave

Oof!
His

people
shot
him.

Why
did
you
stop
me
from

up.
If
we

the
humans,
You
mustn't
give
up.
We'll

You
two
go
on
ahead
now.

What
about
the

Can
we
eat
him?
No,
you
may
not.

seen
us!


Come
on,

There
was
a

It's
all
right,

grieved
and
ashamed
that

for
the
next

it
will
be

Irontown
has
come
under
attack.
The
women
and
the
lepers

Something's
out
there.

power
to
slay
Stop,
Lord
Okkoto,
please!

they're
all
around
us.
No!

won't
let
him
turn
Tell

I
burn!

You
must
fight
it!

Okkoto!
What
is
it?

-
Is
it
San?
Let's
go.



I'm
on
fire.


No!
I
don't

there
Lie?
Don't
be
ridiculous!
So
it's
don't
kill
the
forest
gods.
No!
What
I
want
is
for
the
humans

Just
whose
side
is
he
on
anyway?
The
women
are
on
their
own
now.
They
can
take
care
There's
the
pool.
It's
the
moment
of
truth,
boys,
Why
do
we
need
When
you're
going
to
kill
a
god,

Moro,
what
happened
to
you?
San!

-
San!
Ashitaka!

Okkoto?


Leave,
boy.
Fight
me
and
the
Forest
Spirit

Lord
Okkoto,
calm
your
fury!
O
mighty
lord,
let
me
have
the
girl!
San!
Are
you
there?

-
San!

San!
Stop
him!
-

San!

-


San!
San!
Oh,
Ashitaka!

-
San!
And
here
I
was
saving
to
bite
off
that
damn
woman's
head.
Close
ranks!


Don't
touch
him.


You
can't
even
speak,
Well
done,
men.
Now,
fall
back
Go
on.
Ooh,
what
a
revolting
spectacle.
Hmm.
It's
him.


Give
me
back
my
daughter,
demon.
-


Ashitaka,

The
Forest
Spirit.

Eboshi!
Hold
your
fire!
Huh?
Eboshi!
Your
enemy's
-
But
that
should
have
killed
it.
San!


Don't
die.

I
don't
get
it.
Huh?
-
Quick!
He's
starting
to
change.
I'm
going
to
show
you
a
god
of
life
and
death.
The
trick
is
not
to
fear
him.
No!
Stop!
-

-

You
will
die!


She
did
it!
Quickly!

Quick,
Jigo!
The
porters
are
all
dead!
Be
careful
not
Here
it
is!
-


Milady!
I
told
you.
Come
on!
-
Hurry!
-
Run!


Gonza,
we've
got
-
Island?
I
can't
swim!



Give
her
to
me!
Your
claim
has
been
avenged.
-
Lady
Eboshi.
Don't
waste
your
sympathy.
-
I
promised
Toki
that

He's
searching
for
his
head.
San,
you
have
got
to
help
us.
No!
You're
on
their
side!
Take
that
damn
woman
San?
Never!
Yes,
I'm
human,
San,
Stop
it!
-
San?

Oh.
I'm
sorry.

It's
over.
Everything's
over.
Nothing
is
over.

Hey,
wait!
A
little
crisis
Whoa!
What
are
you
doing?


-
It's
calling
him
to
us!

-

-
It
shouldn't
jam
any
more.
-
It's
awfully
quiet.
I
wonder
if
that
young
man
Don't
worry
about
him.
They'll
be
marching
-

-
Hey,
Kohroku!
-

-
What's
that?
It's
the
Nightwalker!

-


Everybody,
hold
your
positions!
-
Toki,
it's
coming
right
at
us.

No!
We
promised
Lady
Eboshi
Look!
Over
there!
Get
everyone
out!
The
Great
Spirit's
head's
been
cut
off,
If
that
black
ooze
touches
you,
Run
for
the
lake!
Lady
Eboshi
and
the
men
I'm
gonna
try
to
return
his
head
-
What
are
we
gonna
do
now?
-
We'll
never
get
out
now!
Get
everyone
down
to
the
lake

-
Not
that
way!
Stop!

Oh!
There
it
goes!
We're
done
for!
Once
