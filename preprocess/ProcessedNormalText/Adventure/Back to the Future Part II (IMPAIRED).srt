Relax,

It's

Hey,

Undoubtedly,
this
was
some
residual

Doc,
calm
down.
It's
me.
It's
Marty.
It
can't
be
you.
I
sent
you
back
to
the

That's
right,
but
I
came
back
again
You
fainted.
I
brought
you
home.
This
can't

You
can't

It
doesn't
make

MARTY:
I
am

it

Of

it
was
the

I'm
now
in

Could
I
look
myself
up
MARTY:
I
don't
know.
You
always
say
it's
not
good
You're
right,
Marty.
I
know
too
much
already.
Better
that
I
not

Come
on,

MARTY:
I'll
get
him.
Copernicus!
Come
on.
Let's
go
home,

What's
wrong?
What's

Copernicus?
Come
on,

it's

that
I

fall
in

There's
no
scientific
rationale
It's
not
science.

it

Please,
don't
say
that.
That's

off

it
down

We'll
never

a
smooth
enough
surface.
Of
course!
Ice!
We'll
wait
until
winter
MARTY:
Winter?
What
are
you
saying?
All
right.
Let's
just
think
We
know
it
won't
run
under
its
own
power.
But
if
we
could
figure
out
a
way...
...to
push
it

That's
it.
How
fast
can
she
go?
I

you

it's

Ninety?

Just
a
little

I
have,
that's
all.
Theoretically
speaking,
could
it
be
done?
I
suppose,
if
you
had
a
straight
...and
you
weren't
hauling
no
cars...
...and
if
you
could
get
the
fire
hot
enough.
I'm
talking
about
hotter
than
the
blazes
It
might
be
possible
to
get
her
up
that
fast.
When
does
the
next
train
come
through?
Monday
morning
at
8:00.
Here.
This
spur
that
runs
It's
a
long
stretch
of
level
track
This
is
where
we'll
push
the
DeLorean
Funny.
This
map
calls
Clayton
Ravine
That
must
be
the
old
Indian
name
for
it.
A
long
run
that
goes
...over
near
that
Hilldale
housing
development.
Right,
but
according
to
this
map...
...there
is
no
bridge.
MARTY:
We
can't
wait
for
this
thing
to
get
finished.
DOC:
Marty,
it's
perfect.
DOC:
MARTY:
DOC:
It's
safe
and
still
in
use.
As
long
as
we
get
the
DeLorean
...before
we
hit
the
edge
of
the
ravine...
...we'll
instantaneously
arrive
at
a
point
We'll
have
track
under
us
MARTY:
What
about
the
train?
Too
bad
no
one
will
be
around
to
see
it.

CLARA:
Help
me!


CLARA:
Hurry!
DOC:
Jump!


Thank
you,
sir.
You
saved
my...
...life.
Emmett
Brown
at
your
service,
Miss...
Clayton.
Clara
Clayton.
Clara?
What
a
beautiful
name.

DOC:
May
I
help
you
inside
with
these?
That
won't
be
necessary.
I
can
take
care
of
it.
-
You've
done
more
than
enough
already.
She
says
it's
fine,
and
we
have
to
get
going.
Ma'am,
good
luck
Clara.
I'll
straighten
everything
out
Don't
worry
about
that.
That
would
be
very
gentlemanly
of
you,
You
know,
I'm
almost
glad
Otherwise,
we
might
never
have
met.
I
suppose
it
was
destiny.
Thank
you
for
everything.
You're
quite
welcome.
I
will
see
you
again,
won't
I?
Of
course.
You'll
see
lots
of
me.
I'm
the
local
scientist,
I
mean,
blacksmith.
What
sort
of
science?
Astronomy?
Chemistry?
Actually,
I'm
a
student
of
all
sciences.
Doc,
we
have
to
get
going.
Yes.
Excuse
us,
Clara.
We
have
to
get
going.
Toodle-oo.
What
do
you
mean,
I
might
see
her
again
just
in
passing.
Did
you
see
the
way
she
was
looking
at
you?
She
did
have
quite
a
scare,
right?
Miss
Clayton
almost
ended
up
Holy
shit.
-
They
say
she
fell
in
there
100
years
ago.
-
That's
this
year!
We
all
have
teachers
we'd
like
to
see
Great
Scott!
Then
she
was
supposed
to
go
over
Now
I
may
have
seriously
altered
history.
Look,
Doc,
what's
the
worse
that
can
happen?
So
they
don't
name
the
ravine
after
her.
Let's
get
the
DeLorean
ready
I
wish
I'd
never
invented
It's
caused
nothing
but
disaster.
Doc,
this
is
Marty.
Do
you
read
me?
Over.
Check,
Marty.
MARTY:
Great.
These
things
still
work.
All
right.
Once
more,
-
I
apologize
for
the
crudity
of
this
model...
All
right.
Tomorrow
night,
Sunday...
...we
load
the
DeLorean
...
by
the
abandoned
silver
mine.
The
switch
track
is
where
the
spur
runs
...three
miles
out
to
Clayton...
Shonash
Ravine.
The
train
leaves
the
station
We'll
stop
it,
uncouple
the
cars,
...borrow
the
locomotive
and
use
it
According
to
my
calculations
we'll
reach
...the
edge
of
the
ravine,
...and
coast
safely
across
the
completed
bridge.
What
does
this
mean?
"Point
of
no
return."
That's
our
fail-safe
point.
Till
there,
we
have
time
to
stop
the
locomotive
But
once
we
pass
this
windmill,
DOC:
Here
you
go.
DOC:
All
right,
you
all
set?
DOC:
Train
pulling
out
of
the
station!
Coming
up
to
the
switch
track!
Stop
at
the
switch
track!
Throw
the
switch!
Pull
up
to
the
DeLorean!
Pushing
the
DeLorean...
...up
to
88
miles
per
hour!

It
couldn't
be
simpler.

CLARA:
Emmett?
It's
Clara.
Quick,
cover
the
DeLorean!
CLARA:
Hello.
DOC:
This
is
quite
a
surprise.
I
hope
I'm
not
disturbing
anything.
We
were
just
doing
a
little
model
railroading.
When
my
bags
were
thrown
from
the
wagon...
...my
telescope
was
damaged.
Since
you
mentioned
an
interest
in
science...
...I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
repair
it
for
me.
I
would
pay
you,
of
course.
I
wouldn't
think
of
charging
you
for
this.
Let's
have
a
look
at
it.
CLARA:
...if
you
move
it
this
way
the
image
turns
fuzzy.
See?
But
if
you
turn
it
the
other
way...
...then...
Everything
becomes...
...clear.

I
could
repair
it
right
away
Tonight
is
the
town
festival.
I
wouldn't
dream
of
having
you
work
You
are
planning
on
attending,
aren't
you?
-
Actually,
ma'am...
In
that
case,
CLARA:
Mr.
Eastwood.
Thank
you
for
taking
care
of
my
telescope.
DOC:
You're
quite
welcome.
It's
a
nice
telescope.
Ladies
and
gentlemen...
...as
mayor
of
Hill
Valley...
...it
gives
me
great
pleasure
...to
the
people
of
Hill
County!
May
it
stand
for
all
time!
Tell
me
when,
gentlemen.

CROWD:
Three!
Two!
One!
Now!


MAYOR:
Let
the
festivities
begin!
In
a
way,
it's
fitting
that
you
and
I
It's
too
bad
I
didn't
bring
my
camera.
Ready,
gentlemen?
The
only
problem
is,
Smile,
Doc.



What
great
music!
Yeah,
it's
got
a
beat,
and
you
can
dance
to
it.
Step
right
up
and
test
your
mettle
...
from
Col.
Samuel
Colt's
Patent
...of
Hartford,
Connecticut.
Now,
take
this
model,
for
example.
The
new,
...
selling
to
you
tonight
for
the
low
price
of
$12.
-
Good
evening.
You
look
very
nice.
Thank
you.
Would
you
like...
-
Would
you
care
to...
Young
man,
you
want
to
give
it
a
try?
MARTY:
No,
thanks.
Doc,
this...
Son!
-
Sonny
boy!
Son.
SALESMAN:
I
just
told
you
that
even
a
baby
SALESMAN:
Surely
you're
not
afraid
to
try.
Come
on,
then.
Now,
young
man,
what
you
do
...squeeze
off
a
round.
Right
on
out
there
and
be
real
smooth.
That's
the
way
you
do
it.

-
Can
I
try
that
again?
Tell
me
one
thing.
7-Eleven.
Buford,
you
sure
that
blacksmith
Sure
he's
here.
Everybody's
here
tonight.
You'll
have
to
check
your
firearms

TANNEN:
Who's
gonna
make
us,
tenderfoot?
TANNEN:
Marshal
Strickland.
If
you
can't
read
the
sign,
Pretty
tough
hombre
when
you're
pointing
Just
like
you,
I
take
every
advantage
I
can
get.
You
gonna
check
your
iron?
I
was
just
joking
with
your
deputy.
Of
course,
I'm
gonna
check
my
iron.
TANNEN:
We
all
were,
weren't
we,
boys?
DEPUTY:
Tannen.
Your
knife,
too.
TANNEN:
Smile,
Marshal.
After
all,
this
is
a
party.
Only
party
I'll
be
smiling
at...
...is
the
one
that
sees
you
at
the
end
of
a
rope.
Have
fun!

That's
how
you
handle
them.
...and
maintain
discipline
at
all
times.
Remember
that
word:
Discipline.
I
will,
Pa.
WOMAN:
Thank
you
very
much.
Mr.
Eastwood,
nice
to
see
you.
I
see
you
got
yourself
A
couple
people
didn't
like
the
way
That
one
suits
you.
-
It's
very
becoming.
"Frisbee."
Far
out.
-
What
was
the
meaning
of
that?


-
That's
mine!
-
Give
me
that.
-
Where?
THUG
1:
Dancing
with
that
piece
of
calico.
THUG
2:
What
are
you
gonna
do,
boss?
I
figure
if
I
bury
this
muzzle
deep
enough
Careful.
You've
only
got
one
bullet
with
that.
I
only
need
one.

I
told
you
to
watch
your
back,
smithy.
You're
early.
It's
a
Derringer.
Small
but
effective.
The
last
time
I
used
it,
fella
took
two
days
to
die.
Bled
to
death
inside.
It
was
real
painful.
That
means
you'll
be
dead
Excuse
me.
I
don't
know
Look
what
we
have
here.
TANNEN:
Ain't
you
gonna
introduce
me?
I
wouldn't
give
you
the
pleasure.
-
All
right.
TANNEN:
Boys,
keep
the
blacksmith
company

Yeah!
I
don't
dance
very
well
You'll
learn.
Maybe
I'll
just
take
Leave
her
alone!

Yeah,
I
bet
there's
something
you
can
do
I
believe
you've
underestimated
me,
mister.
Have
I?


DOC:
Stop
it!
DOC:
Damn
you!
TANNEN:
No,
I
damn
you!
I
damn
you
to
hell!
-
You.
Mighty
strong
words,
runt!
You
man
enough
to
back
them
up
Just
leave
my
friends
alone.
What's
wrong,
dude?
You
yellow?
That's
what
I
thought.
A
yellow-belly.
Nobody
calls
me
yellow.
TANNEN:
Then
let's
finish
it.
Right
now.
Not
now,
Buford.
Marshal's
got
our
guns.
Like
I
said,
we'll
finish
this
tomorrow!
Tomorrow
we're
robbing
the
Pine
City
stage.
What
about
Monday?
Monday
would
be
fine.
I'll
be
back
this
way
on
Monday.
Right
there,
out
in
the
street...
...
in
front
of
the
Palace
Saloon.
Yeah,
right.
When?
MARTY:
High
noon?
I
do
my
killing
before
breakfast.
7:00!
8:00.
I
do
my
killing
after
breakfast.
DOC:

Marty!
MARSHAL:
Break
it
up.
What's
all
this
about?
TANNEN:
No
trouble,
Marshal.
Just
a
little
personal
matter
This
don't
concern
the
law.
MARSHAL:
Tonight,
everything
concerns
the
law.
Any
brawling,
it's
15
days
in
the
county
jail.
All
right,
folks.
This
is
a
party.


8:00
Monday,
runt.
If
you
ain't
here,
I'll
hunt
you
It's
"dog."
Shoot
him
down
like
a
dog.
Let's
go,
boys!
Let
these
sissies
have
their
party!
What
are
you
doing,
saying
you'll
meet
Tannen?
Don't
worry
about
it.
Theoretically,
yes.
But
what
if
the
train's
late?
-
We'll
discuss
this
later.
-
Thank
you
for
your
gallantry.
Had
you
not
interceded,
Marty...
Clint,
I'm
gonna
take
Clara
home.
-
Right.
Good
night.
I'm
glad
somebody
finally
stood
up
You're
all
right
in
my
book.
You
don't
have
to
buy
me
anything.
You
can
have
this
brand-new
Free?
I
want
everybody
to
know
...was
a
Colt
Peacemaker!
No
problem.
Thanks
a
lot.
Of
course,
if
you
lose,
I'm
taking
it
back.
Thanks
again.
SEAMUS:
You
had
him.
You
could
have
walked
away
and
nobody
All
it
would
have
been
was
words,
Instead,
you
let
him
rile
you...
...into
playing
his
game,
his
way,
by
his
rules.
Seamus,
relax.
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
-
He
reminds
me
of
poor
Martin.
-
Who?
Wait
a
minute.
Had
a
brother.
Martin
used
to
let
men
He
was
concerned
people
That's
how
he
got
a
knife
shoved
through
Never
considered
the
future,
poor
Martin.
Sure,
and
I
hope
you're
I
think
about
it
all
the
time.
CLARA:
DOC:
Yeah.
Listen
to
me.
I
feel
like
I'm
teaching
school.
Please,
continue
the
lesson.
I
never
found
lunar
geography
so
fascinating.
You're
quite
knowledgeable.
When
I
was
11,
I
had
diphtheria.
My
father
brought
this
telescope
...
so
I
could
see
everything
out
the
window.
Do
you
think
we'll
ever
travel
to
the
moon...
...the
way
we
travel
Definitely.
Although
not
for
84
years,
We'll
have
space
capsules
sent
aloft
...devices
that
create
giant
explosions
That
they
break
the
pull
of
gravity
Emmett!
I
read
that
book,
too!
You're
quoting
Jules
Verne,
You've
read
Jules
Verne?
-
I
adore
Jules
Verne.
20,000
Leagues
Under
the
Sea.
The
first
time
I
read
that
as
a
little
boy,
Don't
tease.
You
couldn't
have
read
that
It
was
only
first
published
10
years
ago.
Yes.
I
meant
it
made
me
feel
like
a
boy.
I
never
met
a
woman
I
never
ever
met
a
man
like
you
before.





MARTY:
Doc?
Doc?
Hope
you
know
what
you're
doing.

You
talking
to
me?
You
talking
to
me,
Tannen?
I'm
the
only
one
here.
Go
ahead!
Make
my
day.

PASSERBY:
Good
morning.
Man:
-
No,
that's
fine.
-
We'll
be
praying
for
you.
Good
morning.
I'm
fine.
Thanks.
MARTY:
What
are
you
doing?
I
was
just
out
enjoying
the
morning
air.
It's
really
lovely
here
in
the
morning.
Yes.
We've
got
to
load
the
DeLorean
Look
at
that,
the
tombstone.
DOC:
Let
me
see
that
photograph
again.
My
name,
it's
vanished.
MARTY:
That's
great,
Doc.
We're
going
back
to
the
future
tomorrow,
DOC:
But
only
my
name
is
erased.
The
tombstone
itself
and
the
date
still
remain.
We
know
this
photograph
represents
...if
the
events
of
today
continue
-
Right.
So?
-
I
just
need
to
take
your
measurements.
-
This
is
for
your
coffin.
The
odds
are
running
2-1
against
you.
Might
as
well
be
prepared.
So
it
may
not
be
my
name...
...that's
going
to
be
on
this
tombstone.
-
Great
Scott.
DOC:
Why
are
you
wearing
that
gun?
You're
Tomorrow
morning
I'm
going
But
if
Buford
Tannen
comes
looking
for
trouble,
You
heard
what
that
son
of
a
bitch
called
me.
You
can't
lose
your
judgment
over
names.
That's
exactly
what
causes
you
What?
What
about
my
future?
I
can't
tell
you.
It
might
make
things
worse.
Wait
a
minute.
What
is
wrong
with
my
future?
We
all
have
to
make
decisions
You've
got
to
do
what
you've
got
to
do...
...and
I've
got
to
do
what
I've
got
to
do.
-
Marty.
I've
made
a
decision.
I'm
not
going
with
you
tomorrow.
I'm
staying
here.
What
are
you
talking
about?
There's
no
point
in
denying
it.
-
I'm
in
love
with
Clara.
We
don't
belong
here.
Neither
one
of
us.
It
could
still
be
you
that
gets
shot
tomorrow.
This
tombstone
could
still
be
in
your
future.
Marty,
the
future
isn't
written.
It
can
be
changed.
You
know
that.
Anyone
can
make
their
future
I
can't
let
this
one
little
photograph
I
have
to
live
my
life
...in
my
heart.
Doc,
you're
a
scientist.
So
you
tell
me.

You're
right,
Marty.
-
That
worked
great.
Come
on,
Doc.
Think
about
it.
What
will
you
say
to
her?
"I've
got
to
go
back
to
the
future"?
Hell,
I'm
in
it
with
you,

MARTY:
Doc.
Listen.
Maybe
we...
Maybe
we
can
just
take
Clara
with
us.
To
the
future?
As
you
reminded
me,
I'm
a
scientist,
I
cautioned
you
about
disrupting
Therefore,
I
must
do
no
less.
We
shall
proceed
as
planned,
...we'll
destroy
this
infernal
machine.
Traveling
through
time

It's
Emmett,
Clara.

Emmett,
won't
you
come
in?
No,
I
better
not.
I...
What's
wrong?
I've
come
to
say
good-bye.
Good-bye?
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
going
away.
I'm
afraid
I'll
never
see
you
again.
Emmett.
Clara,
I
want
you
to
know
But
I've
realized
that
I
don't
belong
here,
Where
might
that
be?
I
can't
tell
you.

Then
wherever
you're
going,
take
me
with
you.
I
can't,
Clara.
I
wish
it
didn't
have
to
be
this
way...
...but
believe
me
when
I
tell
you
...and
that
I
love
you.
CLARA:
Clara.
I
don't
think
there's
any
way
Please,
I
have
to
know.
If
you
sincerely
do
love
me,
All
right
then.
I'm
from
the
future.
I
came
here
in
a
time
machine
...and
tomorrow
I
have
to
go
back

Yes,
Emmett.
I
do
understand.
I
understand
that
because
you
know
...you
concocted
those
mendacities
I've
heard
some
whoppers
in
my
day...
...but
the
fact
that
you'd
expect
me
...is
so
insulting
and
degrading!
All
you
had
to
say
is,
"I
don't
love
you
That,
at
least,
would
have
been
respectful!
But
that's
not
the
truth.



PATRON:
Good
to
see
you,
too.
Emmett.
What
can
I
get
you,
the
usual?
No,
Chester,
I'll
need
something
-
Sarsaparilla.
Whiskey?
Are
you
sure?
You
know
what
happened
to
you
Whiskey.
BARMAN:
Okay,
I
ain't
your
papa.
Just
don't
want
to
see
you
do
the
wrong
thing.
You
can
leave
the
bottle.
It's
a
woman,
right?
I
knew
it.
I've
seen
that
look
...a
thousand
times
all
across
the
country.
All
I
can
tell
you,
friend,
Clara
was
one
in
a
million.
One
in
a
billion.
One
in
a
googolplex.
The
woman
of
my
dreams,
I
can
assure
you,
sir,
there
are
other
women.
Peddling
this
barbed
wire
...has
taught
me
one
thing
for
certain...
...it's
that
you
never
know
The
future.
I
can
tell
you
about
the
future.

Man,
did
I
sleep.
What
time
is
it,
Doc?
Doc!
TANNEN:
Wake
up!
Get
up!
Let's
go!
I
got
me
a
runt
to
kill.
THUG
2:
I'm
hungry.
And
in
the
future,
we
don't
need
horses.
We
have
motorized
carriages

If
everybody's
got
one
of
these
auto
whatsits...
...does
anybody
walk
or
run
anymore?
Of
course
they
run,
but
for
recreation,
for
fun.
Run
for
fun?

MARTY:
Doc!
How
much
has
he
had?
None.
That's
the
first
one,
He
just
likes
to
hold
it.

Doc!
What
are
you
doing?
I've
lost
her,
Marty.
That's
why
you
gotta
come
back
with
me.
-
Where?
-
Right!
Let's
get
going!
Gentlemen,
excuse
me.
Here's
to
you,
blacksmith.
-
And
to
the
future.
-
Amen.
MARTY:
Doc!
MARTY:
-
How
many
did
he
have?
-
Just
the
one?
Come
on,
Doc.
-
Get
me
some
black
coffee!


CLERK:
Ma'am?
-
How
far
does
the
8:00
train
go?
I'll
take
a
one-way
ticket.
To
sober
him
up
in
a
hurry,
What
do
you
suggest?
Joey,
let's
make
some
wake-up
juice.
MARTY:
Come
on,
Doc,
swallow.
In
about
10
minutes...
...he's
gonna
be
as
sober
as
a
priest
on
Sunday.
Ten
minutes!
Why
do
we
cut
these
things
so
damn
close?
BARMAN:
When
he
opens
up
his
mouth,
Stand
back.

-
He's
still
out!
It'll
take
a
few
more
minutes
Perfect.

MARTY:
Come
on,
Doc.
Wake
up,
buddy.
Wake
up,
Doc!
Seamus?
Aye.
Something
inside
me
told
me
...as
if
my
future
had
something
to
do
with
it.
He'll
come
around
in
a
minute.
Come
on.
Come
on,
Doc.
Let's
go!
TANNEN:
Are
you
in
there,
Eastwood?
It's
8:00
and
I'm
calling
you
out.
MARTY:
It's
not
8:00
yet!
TANNEN:
It
is
by
my
watch!
Let's
settle
this
once
and
for
all,
runt!
Or
ain't
you
got
the
gumption?
Listen.
I'm
not
really
feeling
up
to
this
today.
-
So
I'll
have
to
forfeit.
What's
that
mean?
-
It
means
that
you
win
without
a
fight.
You
can't
do
that!
You
know
what
I
think?
I
think
you
ain't
nothing
but
a
gutless,
I'm
giving
you
to
the
count
of
10
One!
Doc,
come
on,
sober
up,
buddy.
TANNEN:
Two!
I
got
$20
gold
bet
on
you,
so
don't
let
me
down.
TANNEN:
Three!
MAN
2:
I
got
$30
gold
bet
against
you,
Four!
MAN
3:
You
better
face
up
to
it,
son,
MARTY:
What?
-
What
if
I
don't
go
out
there?
TANNEN:
Six!
And
you'll
be
branded
a
coward
MAN
3:
...is
the
biggest
yellow-belly
in
the
West!
Seven!
Here!
TANNEN:
Eight!
I
already
got
a
gun.
TANNEN:
Nine!
Ten!
Do
you
hear
me,
runt?
I
said
that's
10,
He's
an
asshole!
I
don't
care
what
Tannen
says!
I
don't
care
what
anybody
else
says
either.
MARTY:
Doc,
you
okay?
What
a
headache!
-
You
got
a
back
door
to
this
place?
Let's
go.
Are
you
coming
out
here
The
thing
I
really
miss
here
is
Tylenol.
Hey!
Reach,
blacksmith!


GENTLEMAN:
...had
the
worst
case
of
broken
heart
When
he
said
he
didn't
know
...knowing
how
much
hurt
...I
really
felt
for
him,
I
did,
right
here.
TANNEN:
Listen
up,
Eastwood!
I
aim
to
shoot
somebody
today,
But
if
you're
just
too
damn
yellow...
...it'll
just
have
to
be
your
blacksmith
friend.
Forget
about
me,
Marty,
and
save
yourself!
You
got
one
minute
to
decide.

I've
never
seen
a
man
so
broken
up
What
did
he
say
her
name
was?
-
Clara.
-
Excuse
me.
Was
this
man
tall,
...and
long
silvery,
flowing
hair?
You
know
him.

Emmett!



Time's
up,
runt!


Prepare
to
meet
your
maker,
blacksmith.
MARTY:
Right
here,
Tannen!

Draw!
No!
I
thought
we
could
settle
this
like
men.
You
thought
wrong,
dude.

TANNEN:
Thank
you.






That
was
good.
You
know
what
I
think?
-
I
think
Buford's
going
to
jail.
Get
him
out
of
that
shit.
Get
them!
DEPUTY:
Buford
Tannen,
you're
under
arrest
You
got
anything
to
say?
I
hate
manure.
Look!
Yes!

-
The
train!
We'll
have
to
cut
them
off
at
Coyote
Pass.

BOY:
Hey,
mister.
Mr.
Eastwood.
-
Here's
your
gun,
mister.
Seamus.
It's
worth
$12.
Never
been
used.
SEAMUS:
Maybe
I'll
trade
it
for
a
new
hat.
I
will!

Emmett!
Emmett!
Emmett!
CLARA:
"Time
machine."

Come
on!
MARTY:
Go!


Come
on!
Come
on,
Marty.

Come
on.
Let's
go!
Masks
on.
DOC:
Reach!
DOC:
It's
a
science
experiment.
Stop
the
train
just
before
you
hit

MARTY:
Doc!



I've
wanted
to
do
that
all
my
life.


MARTY:
What
are
these
things?
My
version
of
Presto
Logs.
...chemically
treated
to
burn
hotter
and
longer.
I
use
them
so
I
don't
have
to
stoke
my
forge.
These
three
will
ignite
sequentially...
...make
the
fire
hotter,
...and
make
the
train
go
faster.


Ready
to
roll!



CLARA:
Emmett!
DOC:
Marty,
are
the
time
circuits
on?
Check!
Input
the
destination
time:
October
27,
1985,
11:00
a.m.
MARTY:
Check.
We're
cruising
DOC:
I'm
throwing
in
the
Presto
Logs.

The
new
dashboard
gauge
It's
color-coded
to
indicate
Green,
yellow
and
red.
Each
detonation
will
be
accompanied
Hopefully
we'll
hit
88
miles
per
hour
Why?
What
happens
after
it
hits
2,000?
The
whole
boiler
explodes!
Perfect!

MARTY:
We
just
hit
35!
I'm
coming
aboard!

Emmett!

Come
on.
MARTY:
You
better
hold
onto
something!
Golly.
We
just
passed
40!


Emmett!
We
just
passed
45!
Go
for
it!
MARTY:
Fifty.

Emmett!
Clara!
I
love
you!
MARTY:
What's
happening?
Clara?
Perfect.
She's
in
the
cab!
I'm
going
back
for
her!
The
windmill!
Doc!
We're
going
past
50!
You'll
never
make
it!
Then
we'll
have
to
take
her
back
with
us!
Clara,
climb
out
here
to
me!
-
I
don't
know
if
I
can!
DOC:
Just
don't
look
down!
That's
it!
Sixty
miles
an
hour!

You're
doing
fine!
Nice
and
steady!
Come
on!
-
Just
a
little
further!
MARTY:
Seventy!
DOC:
Come
on!
You're
doing
fine!
Come
on!
Nice
and
easy!
Don't
look
down!
That's
it!
You're
doing
fine!
The
red
log
is
about
to
blow!

Clara!

CLARA:
Emmett!
CLARA:
I'm
trying
to
reach
you!
DOC:
Clara,
hold
on!
I'll
slip
you
the
Hoverboard!
Marty,
watch
out!

CLARA:
Emmett,
help!
Hold
on!
MARTY:
Ready,
Doc?
Catch
it!
Yes!
Emmett!
Clara!











Well,
Doc...
...it's
destroyed.
Just
like
you
wanted.

-
Hey,
butthead,
get
away...
I
didn't
mean
to
scare
you.
-
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
You
going
cowboy?
DAVID:
Dad,
they
won't
hold
your
reservations
all
day.
MR.
MCFLY:
I
can't
find
my
glasses.
MR.
MCFLY:
Have
you
seen
them?
Marty?
What's
wrong?
-
You
wore
that
to
the
lake?
Who
are
you
supposed
to
be?
Clint
Eastwood?
Right.
I
have
to
go
get
Jennifer.
-
I
really
like
that
hat.

MARTY:
Jennifer.
Jen.

Jennifer.

Marty.
Marty!
I
had
the
worst
nightmare.
JENNIFER:
That
dream
I
had
is
so
real.
It
was
about
the
future.
About
us.
And
you
got
fired.
Wait
a
minute.
Hilldale.
Hilldale!
This
is
where
we
live.
I
mean,
this
is
where
we're
going
to
live.
Someday.
It
was
a
dream,
wasn't
it?


NEEDLES:
The
big
M.
-
How's
it
hanging,
McFly?
Nice
set
of
wheels.
NEEDLES:
Next
green
light.
What's
the
matter?
Chicken?

-
Marty,
don't.
KID:
Come
on!

Yeah,
go!



JENNIFER:
Did
you
do
that
on
purpose?
Yeah.
You
think
I'm
stupid
enough



Jeez!
I
would
have
hit
that
Rolls-Royce.
It
erased.
JENNIFER:
Doc's
never
coming
back.
I'll
sure
miss
him,
Jen.

What
the
hell?


-
Doc!
-
Doc!
It
runs
on
steam!

Meet
the
family.
Clara,
you
know.
-
Hi,
Marty!
These
are
our
boys:
Jules
and
Verne.
Boys,
this
is
Marty
and
Jennifer.
-
Doc,
I
thought
I'd
never
see
you
again.
I
had
to
come
back
for
Einstein...
...and
I
didn't
want
you
to
be
worried
about
me.
I
brought
you
a
little
souvenir.
It's
great,
Doc.
Thanks.
JENNIFER:
Dr.
Brown,
I
brought
this
note
...and
now
it's
erased.
Of
course
it's
erased.
What
does
that
mean?
It
means
your
future
hasn't
been
written
yet.
No
one's
has.
Your
future
is
whatever
you
make
it.
We
will,
Doc!
Stand
back!
All
right,
boys,
buckle
up!
MARTY:
No.
Already
been
there.
