This

Lieutenant

Ripley,
we
have
to

We've
lost

I
don't
believe
this.
You

now
you
want
me
Forget
it.

Can
I
finish?
There's
no
way.
GORMAN:
You

I
can
guarantee
your
safety.
BURKE:
These

They're
packing
There's
nothing
Lieutenant,

I
right?
We've
been
trained
to
deal
Then
you
don't
need
me.
BURKE:
But
we
don't
know
It
may
be
a
downed

But
if
it's
not...
I'd
like
you
there
What's
your
interest
The

right.
Running

forklifts.
Yeah.
So?
Nothing.
I
think
it's
great
I
know
it's
the
only
thing
There's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
What
would
you
say
I
could
get
you
reinstated
The
Company's
already
agreed
If
I
go.
Yeah,
if
you
go.
Come
on.
I
think
personally
for
you...
it
would
be
the
best
thing
Get
back
on
the
horse.
Spare
me.
I
know.
I've
read
it.
You
wake
up
every
night,
I
said
no,
and
I
mean
it!
Now
please
leave.
I
am
not
going
back...

I
would
not
be
OK.
Shh.
Would
you
do
me
a
favor?
GORMAN:
Thanks
for
the

Aah!
Oh.

Hello.
Ripley.
You
OK?
RIPLEY:
You're
going
out
there
Not
to
study.
Not
to
bring

But
to
wipe
them
out.
That's
the
plan.
All
right,
I'm
in.
I
think
that...
And
you,
you

you're
staying

Quit

It's
common

I
prefer
the
term
Right.
Is
there
a
problem?
BURKE:
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
know
Ripley's
last
trip,
the
syn...
the
artificial
person
Malfunctioned?
There
were
problems,
I'm
shocked.
Was
it
an
older

Yeah.
That
explains
it.
The

That
could
never
happen
now
It
is
impossible
for

Just

GORMAN:
Good

I'm
sorry
we
didn't
have
time
HUDSON:
Sir!
What
is
it,
Hicks?
HUDSON:
Hudson,
sir.
He's
Hicks.
What's
the
question?
Is
this
gonna
be
a
stand-up
All
we
know
is
there's
still
and
a
xenomorph
may
be
involved.
APONE:
Excuse
me,
sir.
A
what?
GORMAN:
A
xenomorph.
HICKS:
lt's
a
bug-hunt.
What
exactly
GORMAN:
Ripley.
RIPLEY:
We
set
down
on
LV-426.
A
crew
member
with
something
attached
some
kind
of
parasite.
We
tried
to
get
it
off.
Later,
it
seemed
to
come
off
Kane
seemed
fine.
We
were
all
having
dinner.
It
must
have
laid
some
sort
of
embryo.
He
started...
Um,
he...
VASQUEZ:
Look,

where
they
are.
DRAKE:

Fuck
you,

RIPLEY:
Are
you
finished?
I
hope
you're
right.
GORMAN:
Yeah,
OK.
Right.
We
have
Ripley's
report
on

RIPLEY:
Because
just
one
wiped
out
my
crew
If
the
colonists
there's
no
telling
how
many
Do
you

GORMAN:
Anyway,
we
have

Any
questions?
What
is
it,
Private?
How

Come
on,

down.
Ease
down.
Ease
down.
Ease
down.
RIPLEY:
You
OK?
HUDSON:
I'm
all
right.
Get
away
from
me,
man!
HICKS:
Lieutenant.
RIPLEY:
What
happened
to
Gorman?
HICKS:
I
don't
know...
maybe
a
concussion,
VASQUEZ:
No,
man,
he's
dead!
Wake
up,
pendejo!
HICKS:
Back
off.
Right
now.
Somebody
get
me
a
first
aid
kit.
HUDSON:
Hey.
Hey,
look.
The
Sarge
and
Dietrich
Their
signs
are
real
low,
Then
we
get
them.
-
We
don't
leave
people
behind!
You
can't
help
them!
You
can't.
Right
now
they're
being
cocooned
HUDSON:
Oh,
dear
Lord
Jesus,
HICKS:
God
damn
it.
HUDSON:
This
isn't
happenin'!
We've
got
I
say
we
roll
them
in
there
HICKS:
lt's
worth
a
try,
but
we
HUDSON:
Let's
bug
out
and
call
RIPLEY:
I
say
we
take
off
and
It's
the
only
way
to
be
sure.
HUDSON:
Fuckin'
"A"!
BURKE:
Hold
on
one
second.
This
installation
They
can
bill
me.
OK,
look.
This
is
an
emotional
moment
I
know
that.
But
let's
not
make
This
is
clearly
an
important
and
I
don't
think
you
or
I
to
arbitrarily
exterminate
them.
Wrong.
VASQUEZ:
Yeah.
Watch
us.
HUDSON:
Maybe
you
haven't
been
but
we
just
got
I'm
not
blind
but
I
cannot
authorize
that
kind
Well,
I
believe
Corporal
Hicks
Corporal
Hicks
is...
RIPLEY:
This
operation
Hicks
is
next
in
chain
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's
right.
BURKE:
Yeah.
Look,
Ripley...
this
is
a
multimillion
dollar
He
can't
make
that
decision.
Uh,
no
offense.
HICKS:
None
taken.
Ferro,
do
you
copy?
FERRO:
Standing
by.
HICKS:
Prep
for
dust-off.
FERRO:
Roger.
On
our
way.
HICKS:
I
say
we
take
off,
It's
the
only
way
to
be
sure.
Let's
do
it.
HICKS:
Let's
go.
Pick
it
up,
baby.
All
right.
Set
him
down
here.
Move
it,
Spunkmeyer.
Hold
on
a
second.
FERRO:
Just
get
up
here.
I'm
in.
Ramp
closing.
Spunkmeyer.
God
damn
it.

Well,
where
the
fuck...
Run!
Well,
that's
great.
Now
what
the
fuck
We're
in
some
real
HICKS:
Are
you
finished?
HICKS:
You
all
right?
NEWT:
I
guess
we're
not
RIPLEY:
I'm
sorry,
Newt.
You
don't
have
to
be
sorry.
HUDSON:
That's
it,
man.
What
the
fuck
What
are
we
gonna
do?
BURKE:
Maybe
we
could
build
Why
don't
we
try
that?
NEWT:
We'd
better
get
back
and
they
mostly
come
at
night.
Mostly.
HICKS:
That's
everything,
right?
This
is
absolutely
everything
out
of
the
APC
wreckage.
We
got
four
pulse-rifles
That
ain't
so
good.
We
got
fifteen
Don't
touch
that.
RIPLEY:
HICKS:
Yeah.
It's
only
And
another
one's
damaged.
I
don't
know
about
that
one.
But
the
good
news...
we
got
four
of
these
with
display
They
really
kick
ass.
How
long
after
we're
declared
Seventeen
days.
Seventeen
days?
Hey,
man,
I
don't
wanna
but
we're
not
gonna
last
Those
things
are
gonna
come
here
Hudson!
Hudson!
This
little
girl
with
no
weapons
and
no
training.
Right?
Why
don't
you
put
her
in
charge?
You
better
just
start
Deal
with
it,
and
I'm
sick
of
your
bullshit.
Now
get
on
a
terminal
Construction
blueprints.
Anything
that
shows
the
layout.
-
Are
you
listening?
RIPLEY:
I
need
to
see
air
ducts,
sub-basements...
every
possible
way
We
don't
have
much
time.
OK.
OK,
I'm
on
it.
RIPLEY:
Hudson!
Just
relax.
l'll
be
in
med
lab.
l'll
check
on
Gorman,
Fine.
You
do
that.
RIPLEY:
This
service
tunnel...
must
be
how
HUDSON:
That's
right.
It
moves
from
right
into
the
sub-level.
Come
down
on
that.
OK,
come
over.
Hold
it.
Go
back.
Punch
that
in
there.
HICKS:
No.
It's
back
here.
RIPLEY:
OK.
There's
a
pressure
door
Couldn't
we
put
a
remote
then
seal
that
door?
HICKS:
That'll
work...
but
we
gotta
figure
on
them
RIPLEY:
That's
right,
so...
we
repair
the
barricades
HICKS:
Right.
...and
weld
plate
steel
over
and
here.
Then
they
can
only
come
at
us
HICKS:
Right.
Then
we
put
and
here,
right?
-
Right.
Now
all
we
need
Let's
move
HUDSON:
Affirmative.
NEWT:
Affirmative.
HUDSON:
Do
your
thing,
baby.
Come
on,
Vasquez,
"A"
and
"B"
sentries
HICKS:
Roger.
Test
it,
Hudson.
-
Do
it.
HUDSON:
Great.
We're
sealing
the
tunnel.
Come
on,
baby.
HICKS:
For
what
it's
worth.
I
want
you
to
put
this
on.
RIPLEY:
What's
it
for?
It's
a
locator.
Then
I
can
find
you
anywhere
It's
just
a
precaution.
Thanks.
Doesn't
mean
we're
engaged
All
right,
what's
next?
RIPLEY:
Last
stop.
Get
in.
Scoot
down.
That's
good.
Now
lie
here
and
have
a
nap.
You're
very
tired.
I
don't
want
to.
Well,
I
bet
Casey
Let's
take
a
look.
Nope.
Nothing
bad
in
there.
See?
Maybe
you
could
just
Ripley,
she
doesn't
because
she's
just
Right.
I'm
sorry,
Newt.
RIPLEY:
There.
My
mommy
always
said
no
real
ones,
but
there
are.
Yes,
there
are,
aren't
there?
Why
do
they
tell
Most
of
the
time
it's
true.
Did
one
of
those
things
I
don't
know,
Newt.
That's
the
truth.
Isn't
that
how
babies
come...
I
mean,
people
babies?
They
grow
inside
you.
No.
That's
very
different.
NEWT:
Did
you
ever
have
a
baby?
Yes,
I
did.
I
had
a
little
girl.
Where
is
she?
She's
gone.
You
mean
dead.
Here.
Take
this.
For
luck.
How's
that?
Don't
go,
please.
Newt,
I'm
gonna
be
And
you
see
that
camera?
I
can
see
you
to
see
if
you're
safe.
I'm
not
gonna
leave
you,
Newt.
I
mean
that.
That's
a
promise.
You
promise?
I
cross
my
heart.
And
hope
to
die?
And
hope
to
die.
Now
go
to
sleep...
and
don't
dream.
Sneak.
BISHOP:
after
the
creature's
death,
Bishop,
that's
interesting,
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
Let's
go
through
it
again.
They
grab
the
colonists,
and
they
immobilize
them
Which
means
there
would
have
One
for
each
colonist.
Yes.
That
follows.
Each
one
of
these
things
So
who's
laying
these
eggs?
I'm
not
sure.
It
must
be
something
Hey,
maybe
-
Bees
have
hives.
There's,
like,
one
female
BISHOP:
Yes.
The
queen.
HUDSON:
Yeah.
The
mama.
And
she's
badass,
man.
-
These
things
ain't
ants.
Bishop,
I
want
as
soon
as
Mr.
Burke
gave
instructions...
they
were
to
be
kept
alive
He
was
very
specific
about
it.
Those
two
specimens
to
the
bio-weapons
division.
If
you're
smart,
we
can
both
and
we
will
be
set
up
for
life.
You're
crazy,
Burke.
Do
you
think
you
can
get
past
ICC
quarantine?
How
can
they
impound
it
But
they
will
know
Just
like
they'll
know
for
the
deaths
of
one
hundred
BURKE:
Wait
a
second!
-
You
sent
them
to
that
ship.
I
just
checked
directive
dated
6-12-79,
You
sent
them
out
there
Why
didn't
you
warn
them,
Burke?
What
if
that
ship
Did
you
think
about
that?
So
if
I
made
a
major
everybody
steps
in...
and
there's
no
Nobody
wins.
I
made
a
decision,
It
was
a
bad
call,
Ripley.
RIPLEY:
Bad
call?
Haven't
you
any
idea
I'm
gonna
make
sure
You're
not
gonna
sleaze
your
way
Right
to
the
wall.
Ripley.
You
know,
I
thought
I'm
happy
to
disappoint
you.

HUDSON:
What's
going
on?
HICKS:
They're
coming.

Where?
Here

Well,

RIPLEY:

HUDSON:
That's

man.
HICKS:
How
long
till
it
blows?
BISHOP:
Four
hours...
with
a
blast
radius
equal
to
about
forty
megatons.
HICKS:

Why

VASQUEZ:

break!
HUDSON:

The

Shut

What
about
The
uplink
tower
The
hard-wiring
between

We

Somebody's

Yeah,

HUDSON:

RIPLEY:
What?

only
one
qualified
HUDSON:
Yeah,
right,
man.
Good
idea.
BISHOP:
Believe
me,
I
may
be
synthetic,
RIPLEY:
How
long?
BISHOP:
This
conduit
runs
one
hundred
eighty
meters.
Say
forty
minutes
an
hour
to
patch
in
thirty
minutes
and
about
fifty
minutes
RIPLEY:
lt's
gonna
be
close.
RIPLEY:
Good
luck.
BISHOP:
See
you

Watch
your

percent.
"C"

HUDSON:

HICKS:

Ten.
Damn

Wait!
They're
retreating.
RIPLEY:
The
guns
stopped
them.
You're
right.
HICKS:
Next
time
Yeah,
but
they
don't
know
that.
They're
probably
looking
That'll
take
'em
a
while.

Maybe

demoralized.
I
