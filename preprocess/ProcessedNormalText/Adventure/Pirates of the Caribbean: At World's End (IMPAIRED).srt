Because

Because

There

a
price
on

is
true.

the
only
way

by
betraying

We

But
now
that

What

You

You

And

But

notice
What
is
it
you
seek
Jack

He's
one
of
the

lords.

The
only
reason...

...is
so

Nine
of

What's
the

of
that,
Nothing

Nothing

Did
your

He

on

Hmm.
Then

the

of

Better

this

We

anyone

Ah,

Yes.
Something
for

there.
Your

Not

All

The

That's
what

Yeah.

Nothing

Clear
as

That's

Once
every

0

-
Once

Even

But

Dead?
Or

Come

Not

Sundown.
And

What's

Where?

What
is
it?
He's
rocking
the

We're
rocking
the

Aye.
He's
onto
it.

He's
rocking
the

We'll
tie
each
other

when
the
boat
flips
Time
it
with

Loose
the

you

Unstow

Quite

Ow!
There's

You
