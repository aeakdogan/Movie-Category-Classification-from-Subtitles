Come

Come

Come

I'm
coming
to

you.
Where

you
little
rascal?
Hm.

Where
is

little
birthday

I'm
going
to
gobble

I'm
going
to

Och,
Fergus,
no
weapons
on
the
table.
Can
I
shoot
an
arrow?
Please?
Can
I?

-
Not
with
that.
Why
not...
...use
your
very
own?
-


-
Now,
there's
a
good
girl.
Draw
all
the
way
back
now
Keep
both
eyes
open.
And,
loose!

I
missed.
A
bow,
Fergus?
She's
a
lady.
-
Ooh!
You!





A
will-0'-
the-wisp.

They
are
real.
ELINOR:
-
We're
leaving
now.
-
I
saw
a
wisp.
You
know,
some
say
that
-
Oh,
aye.
Or
an
arrow.
Come
on,
let's
be
off
before
we

Well,
he
should.

it's

Elinor,
run!

Come
on,
you!

MERIDA:
Some
say
our
destiny
...as
much
a
part
of
us
as
we
are
of
it.
Others
say
fate
is
woven
together

So
that
one's
destiny
intertwines
It's
the
one
thing
we
search
for
Some
never
find
it.
But
there
are
some
who
are
led.

The
story
of
how
my
father
lost
his
leg
to
the
demon
bear
Mor'du

I
became
a
sister
to
three
new
brothers.
The
princes.
Wee
devils,
more
like.
They
get
away
with
murder.
I
can
never
get
away
with
anything.
I'm
the
princess.
-
Oh!
MERIDA:
I'm
the
example.

I've
got
duties,
responsibilities,
My
whole
life
is
planned
out,
preparing
for
the
day
I
become...
Well,
my
mother.
She's
in
charge
-

"Aye,
Robin,
Jolly
Robin,
Project!
"And
thou
shalt
know
of
mine!"
Enunciate.
You
must
be
understood
or
it's
all
for
naught.
-
This
is
all
for
naught.
-

A
princess
must
be
knowledgeable
She
does
not
doodle.

That's
a
C,
dear.
-


A
princess
does
not
chortle.
-
Mm!
Rises
early.
-
...
Is
compassionate...
...patient,
cautious,
clean.
And
above
all,
a
princess
MERIDA:
But
every
once
in
a
while,
there's
a
day
No
lessons,
no
expectations.
A
day
where
anything
can
happen.
A
day
I
can
change
my
fate.
Yah!

When
cold
wind
is
a'
calling,
Misty
mountains
sing
and
beckon,
I
Will
ride,
I
Will
fly
Chase
the
wind
and
touch
the
sky
I
will
fly
Whoo-hoo!

Where
dark
woods
hide
secrets
Deep
waters
hold
reflections
I
will
read
every
story,
-
Oh!
Be
as
strong
as
the
seas
are
stormy
And
proud
as
an
eagle's
scream
I
Will
ride,
I
Will
fly
Chase
the
wind
and
touch
the
sky
I
will
fly

And
touch
the
sky
Whoo!
Chase
the
wind
Touch
the
sky

I'm
starving.
You
hungry
too,
Angus?
Pfft!
-
Oats
it
is,
then.
Good
day,
Princess.
I
cannot
find
the
salt.
It
was
over
there
a
minute
ago,
And
then,
out
of
nowhere,
His
hide
littered
with
the
weapons
His
face
scarred
with
one
dead
eye.
I
drew
my
sword
and...
Whoosh!
One
swipe,
his
sword
shattered.
Then
"chomp"!
Dad's
leg
was
clean
off.
Down
the
monster's
throat
it
went.
Oh,
that's
my
favorite
part.
Mor'du
has
never
been
seen
since,
and
is
roaming
the
wilds
-

I'll
finish
what
I
guddled
in
the
first
place.
Merida,
a
princess
does
not
place
Mum!
It's
just
my
bow.
A
princess
should
not
have
weapons
FERGUS:
Leave
her
be.
Princess
or
not,
Mum?
-
Hm?
and
drank
from
the
Fire
Falls.
Fire
Falls?
They
say
only
the
ancient
kings

-
What
did
you
do,
dear?
Hungry,
aren't
we?
-
Mum!
Oh,
Fergus,
will
you
look
at
-

-
Oh,
you
great...
Boys,
you're
naughty.
Don't
just
play
with
your
haggis.
-
Urgh!

if
you
won't
try
it?
That's
just
a
wee
sheep's
stomach.
It's
delicious.
Mm!

-
My
lady.
FERGUS:
You're
getting
too
big,
ELINOR:
Aha.
From
the
Lords
Macintosh,
Their
responses,
no
doubt.
AYE,
aye!
-
FERGUS:
Hey,
hey!

Stay
out
of
my
food,
Chew
on
that,
you
manky
dogs!
-

They've
all
accepted.

Who's
accepted
what,
Mother?
Boys,
you
are
excused.

-
Oof!
Hey!

What
did
I
do
now?
Your
father
has
something
Fergus?
Oh.


Er...
Merida.

The
lords
are
presenting
-
What?
-
Dad!
You...
She...
Elinor?
Honestly,
Merida,
I
don't
know
why

This
year,
each
clan
will
present
a
suitor
I
suppose
a
princess
A
princess
does
not
raise
her
voice.
Merida,
this
is
what
you've
been
No,
it's
what
you've
been
preparing
I
won't
go
through
with
it.
Merida!
Huh?
Merida!
-
Urgh!
Boys!

Mother.
Suitors?
Marriage?
Once
there
was
an
ancient
kingdom...
Oh,
Mum!
Ancient
kingdom.
Its
name
long
forgotten,
ruled
by
a
wise
and
fair
king
And
when
he
grew
old
he
divided
that
they
should
be
the
pillars
But
the
oldest
prince
He
followed
his
own
path
to
war,
and
chaos
and
ruin.
That's
a
nice
story.
It's
not
just
a
story,
Merida.
Legends
are
lessons.
Och,
Mum.
I
would
advise
you
The
clans
are
coming
-
It's
not
fair.
It's
marriage.


-
FERGUS:
You're
muttering.
Aye,
you
do.
You
mutter,
lass,
I
blame
you.
Stubbornness.
It's
entirely
from
your
side
of
the
family.

Och,
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
-
Speak
to
her,
dear.
-
She
just
doesn't
listen.
Pretend
I'm
Merida.
Speak
to
me.
What
would
you
say?
Och...
I
can't
do
this.
Sure
you
can.
There,
there.
That's
my
queen.
Right,
here
we
go.
"I
don't
want
to
get
married.
"I
want
to
stay
single
"as
I
ride
through
the
glen

Merida,
all
this
work,
schooling
you,
I
ask
you,
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do?
Call
off
the
gathering.
You're
the
queen.
You
can
just
tell
the
lords
In
fact,
she
might
not
ever
be
ready
Good
day
to
you.
We'll
expect
your
I
understand
this
must
all
seem
unfair.
Even
I
had
reservations
But
we
can't
just
run
away
I
don't
want
my
life
to
be
over.
I
want
my
freedom!
But
are
you
willing
to
pay
the
price
I'm
not
doing
any
of
this
to
hurt
you.
If
you
could
just
try
to
see
what
I
do,
But
it's
my
life,
it's...

I'm
just
not
ready.
I
think
you'd
see,
if
you
could
just...
I
think
I
could
make
you
understand
-
...
listen.

I
swear,
Angus,
Not
if
I
have
any
say
in
it.

MacGuffin!
MEN:
MacGuffin!

Dingwall!

Macintosh!
Ooh!
Aah!
Oh.


You
look
absolutely
beautiful.
I
can't
breathe.
Och,
shush!
Give
us
a
turn.

I
can't
move.
It's
too
tight.

-
Merida?
Just...
Remember
to
smile.

Places,
everyone.
Places.

Oh!


I
look
fine,
woman!
Leave

be!

I

So,

MEN:

sword,
Stab
Blooder,
vanquished
1,000
foes.
MEN:

my

was
besieged
by
10,000
Romans
and
he
took
out
a
whole
armada
With
one
arm,
he
was...
With
one
arm
he
was
steering
the
ship
and
with
the
other
and
struck
down
a
whole
attacking
fleet.

MAN:
Lies!
-

Or
are
ye
scared,
simpering
jackanapes,
afraid
to
muss
your
pretty
hair?
-
At
least
we
have
hair.

-
MAN:
Huh?
And
we
don't
hide
under
bridges,

You
want
to
laugh,
huh?
Wee
Dingwall!

Get
off
me!





Nut
'em!
Nut
'em!
That's
the
way
to...
All
right.
Shut
it!

Now,
that's
all
done.
Show
a
little
decorum.
And
no
more
fighting.
-




Cw!



FERGUS:
You
want
a
fresh
one?


FERGUS:
Crivens,
you're
fierce.
I
didn't
start
it.
It
Was...
My
lady
Queen,
I
feel
terrible.
-
We
mean
no
disrespect.
-
Yes,
dear.
Now,
where
were
we?
Ah,
yes.
In
accordance
with
our
laws,
by
the
rights
of
our
heritage,
only
the
firstborn
of
each

be
presented

thus
compete
for

To
win
the
fair

feats

or

It
is
customary
that

Archery!
Archery.

I
choose
archery.

Let
the
games
begin!



Pull!

Pull!

-
I'll
just
take
one.
PRINCE:
Ooh!
Oh!
Now,
I
have
told
you,
-
Oh!

It's
time!

Archers,
to
your
marks!
And
may
the
lucky

find
its

Oi!
Get
on
with
it.
CROWD:
Ooh.

Och!

Or
holding
up
bridges.


CROWD:
Aw...

At
least
you
hit
the
target,
son.

Oh,
that's
attractive.

I
got
it!
And
such
lovely
flowing
locks.

Fergus.


Oh,
wee
lamb.
Oh,
come
on!
Shoot,
boy!
-

Well
done,
lad!
Well
done.

-
Feast
your
eyes!
-
That's
my
boy.

Well,
that's
just
grand
now,
isn't
it?
-
Guess
who's
coming
to
dinner?
By
the
way,
hope
you
don't
mind

-

Firstborn
descendant
of

I'll
be
shooting
for
my
own
hand.
-
Oh!
What
are
you
doing?
Merida!
Curse
this
dress!


Merida,
stop
this!
Don't
you
dare
loose
another
arrow.

Merida,
I
forbid
it.
Michty
me!
-
You're
the
one
that
wants
me
to...
-
You
embarrassed
me.
You
don't
know
what
you've
done!
-
Just
don't
care
howl...
-
Just
listen!
You
listen
to
me!
Ugh!
This
is
so
unfair!
Ha!
Unfair?
You're
never
there
for
me.
This
whole
marriage
is
what
you
want.
Do
you
ever
bother
You
walk
around
telling
me
what
to
do,
trying
to
make
me
be
like
you.
Well,
I'm
not
going
to
be
like
you.
Oh,
you're
acting
like
a
child.
And
you're
a
beast.
-
That's
what
you
are!
-
I'll
never
be
like
you.
-
I'd
rather
die
than
be
like
you!
Merida,
you
are
a
princess,
-
and
I
expect
you
to
act
like
one.
Oh!

ELINOR:
Merida!
Merida!
Oh,
dear.
Ah!
Oh,
no.
What
have
I
done?
Oh.


Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Whoa!

Angus!




-

Come
on,
Angus.
Angus!







Why
would
the
wisps
lead
me
here?

Uh...

Oh,
look
around.
You
holler
if
you
see
anything
you
like.
Everything
is
half
off.
Uh...
-
Who
are
you?
Um...
I
don't
understand...

-
See
anything
you
like?
Perhaps
a
touch
of
whimsy
But
the
will-0'-
the-wisps,
they...
Oh!
This
is
one
of
a
kind!
I'll
make
you
a
deal
for
this
rare
prize.
-
Your
broom!
-
It
was
sweeping
by
itself.
Wood
cannot
be
imbued
I
should
know.
I'm
a
wit...
Whittler.
Of
wood.
Oh,
how
about
this
conversation
starter?
-

Oh,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!
That's
stuffed.

-
Staring
is
rude.
That's
not
all
I
can
do.
La-la
la-la
la-la
-


-
You're
a
witch!
That's
why
the
wisps
led
me
here.
-
Woodcarver!
-
Woodcarver!
I'm
not
a
witch!
If
you're
not
going
to
buy
anything,
-
No!
The
wisps
led
me
here!
-
Get
out!
Shoo!
Get!
Be
gone
with
you!
-
What?
What
was
that?
Well...


And
how
are
you
going
-
With
this.
Oh,
my,
that's
lovely,
that
is.
That
would
set
us
up
for
months.

-
MERIDA:
Ah,
ah,
ah.
-
Every
carving
and
one
spell.
Are
you
sure
I
want
a
spell
to
change
my
mum.
That'll
change
my
fate.
Hmm...
Done!
-


-

What
are
you
doing?
You
never
conjure
where
you
carve.
Very
important.
WITCH:
The
last
time
I
did
this
-

Easy
on
the
eyes.
Tight
pants.
He
demanded
I
give
him
And
he
gave
me
this
for
a
spell.
A
spell
that
would
change
his
fate.
And
did
he
get
what
he
was
after?

Yes.
And
made
off
with
an

Now,
what
do
I
need?
Oh!
-
Just
a
little
bit
of
this.
Ah.

Hoo!

Tee-tee-tee-tee.
Whoosh.
That'll
do.

-



And
now
let's
see.
What
have
we
here?

Oh!
-
Hey!
Uh,
a
cake?
-
You
don't
want
it?
You're
sure
if
I
give
this
to
my
mum,
it
will
change
my
fate?
Oh.

Trust
me.
It'll
do
the
trick,
dearie.
Expect
delivery
of
your
purchase
Ooh!
Ooh...
What
was
that
thing
about
the
spell?
Did
you
say
something
about
the
spell?
Mor'du,
Mor'du,
now
the
time

ALL:
Hooray!
Mor'du,
Mor'du...

-
ELINOR:
Merida.
Ooh,
uh...
I,
uh...
-
Oh,
I've
been
worried
sick.
I
didn't
know
where
you'd
gone
I
didn't
know
what
to
think.
Oh.
Angus
threw
me.
But
I'm
not
hurt.
Well,
you're
home
now,
-
Honestly?
Your
father's
out
there
Come
taste
my
blade,
you
manky
bear
For
gobbling
up
my
/99
I'll
hunt
you,
then
I'll
skin
you,

Of
course,
we
both
know
-
What's
this?
I
made
it.
For
you.
Special.
You
made
this
for
me?
Mm.
Oh.
Interesting
flavor.
-
How
do
you
feel?
-
Different?
Tart
and,
um,

gamy.
Have
you
changed
your
mind
at
all
Oh,
that's
better.
Now,
why
don't
we
go
and
put
this
whole
kerfuffle
to
rest?
Hm?

Ooh.
-
Mother?
My
head's
spinning
like
a
top.
Ooh!
-
Mum!
Er...
How...
How
do
you
feel
Merida!
Oh,
just
take
me
to
my
room.
FERGUS:
All
right,
that's
fine.
A
little
to
the
left.
That's
good.
It's
good
enough.
Now,
clear
out
of
there,
boys.
-
What?

We've
been
waiting
patiently.
Milords,
I
am
out
of
sorts
But
you
shall
have
your
answer.
-
Oh!
Presently.
Now,
if
you'll

excuse
us.
-

It's
Mor'du!

Elinor?
Are
you
all
right,
dear?
Fine.
I'm
fine.
Go
about
avenging
your
leg.
Oh...
Aye.
You
heard
her,
lads.
I
dream
about
the
perfect
way

Just
take
all
the
time
you
need
Then
maybe
in
a
bit
you
might
have
What
was
in
that
cake?

Cake.

Mum?
So
I'll
just
tell
them

Mum?




Bear!



-


Oh!
Mum?
You're...
You're
a
bear!

Why
a
bear?
Oh,
that
scaffy
witch
It's
not
my
fault.
I
didn't
ask
her
I
just
wanted
her
to
change
you.


-
Shh.
Did
you
hear
that?

Something's
not
right.

There's
no
point
in
having
a
go
at
me.
Goggly
old
hag.
Eyes
all
over
the
place.
-
Unbelievable.
-
I'll
get
her
to
fix
this.
MERIDA:
Why
do
I
always
get
blamed

Everybody,
follow
me.
And
keep
a
sharp
eye.
Here
we
go.
But
we
haven't
had
dessert
yet.


I
have
no
idea.
MERIDA:
Mum,
you
can't
go
out
there.
Mum!
Wait!
What
are
you
doing?
If
he
so
much
as
sees
you,
you're
dead.
LORD
DINGWALL:
Another
one
of
LORD
MACINTOSH:
Mum!
LORD
MACINTOSH:...
my
liege?
LORD
MACGUFFIN:
Best
to
humor
him.

He's
like
a
hound
with
that
nose
of
his.

Mum,
wait.
-
We
have
to...
-

Stop.
Stop!

You're
covered
with
fur.
You're
not
naked.
It's
not
like
anyone's
gonna
see
you.

Now
you've
done
it.

Maudie!
-

-


A
bear!
I
knew
it!


Would
you
just
listen
to
me?
-
We
can't
go
this
way.
You'll
be
seen.
Quick!
This
way!
Mum?



Mum?
Oh!

-
Oh!
Hm?
A
witch
turned
Mum
into
a
bear.
We've
got
to
get
out
of
the
castle.
Oh,
all
right.
You
can
have
my
desserts
Okay.
Fine.
A
year.
-
Did
you
hear
that?


-
There
it
goes!
-


-

There
it
goes!


-
Come
on,
Mum.

LORD
MACGUFFIN:
FERGUS:
Try
shutting
yours!


-
There
he
is!

FERGUS:
I'm
sure
it
went
this
way.
LORD
MACGUFFIN:
It
must
have
sprouted
wings.
Was
carried
away
by
a
giant
birdy.
-
A
dragon,
perhaps.
Doesn't
make
sense.
He's
got
big
giant
paws!
Let's
just
get
inside.

It's
locked.
LORD
DINGWALL:

HANDMAID:
What
did
you
see,
Maudie?
Oh,
for
goodness'
sakes,
Maudie,


HANDMAID:
Maudie,
honey,
come
here!
Come
on,
Mum.
Quick.

Shh.





They'll
be
fine.
Won't
you,
boys?

Mum,
we've
got
to
hurry.
Now,
I'll
be
back
soon.
Go
on
and
help
yourself


Oh!

Right!
MERIDA:
Where
are
these
wisps?
Come
out,
wisps.
Come
on
out.
Lead
me
to
the
witch's
cottage.
I'm
here!
Fine.
Don't
come
out

I
was
standing
right
here
Then
a
whole
trail
of
them
Oh,
does
she
think
we're
just
going


Oh,
Mum,
I
know
this
place.
The
witch's
cottage...
It's
this
way!
Come
on!
Hurry!
I
can't
believe
it.
I
found
it.

No.
She
was
here.
No,
really,
she
was
just
here.

Oh,
Wait.
-
No.
No,
no.
No!
No!

Welcome
to
the
Crafty
Carver,
home
of
bear-themed
carvings
I
am
completely
out
of
stock
at
this
time.
But
if
you'd
like
to
enquire
about
pour
vial
one
into
the
cauldron.
If
you'd
like
the
menu
in
Gaelic,
vial
two.
If
you're
that
red-haired
lass,
vial
three.
To
speak
with
a
live
homunculus...
Princess,
I'm
off
to
the
Wickerman
and
won't
be
back
till
spring.
There's
one
bit
I
forgot
to
tell
you
By
the
second
sunrise,
-

Fate
be
changed,
look
inside,
mend
the
bond
torn
by
pride.
"Fate
be
changed...
Mend
the
bond.
"
One
more
time.
Fate
be
changed,
look
inside,
mend
the
bond
torn
by
pride.
That's
it.
Ta-ta.
Oh,
and
thank
you
for
shopping
No.
No!
Where'd
you
go?
-
Welcome
to
the
Crafty
Can/er...
...for
all
your...
Maybe
there's
a
book
of
spells.
I'm
off
to
the
Wickerman
Festival

Thank
you
for
visiting.





We'll
sort
it
out
tomorrow.



-

Oh.

My
brave
wee
lassie,
I'm
here.
I'll
always
be
right
here.



Uh...
Good
morning.

So...

-
What's
all
this
supposed
to
be?
Oh.

What?

Sorry.
I
don't
speak
bear.

Oh.

Ah!


-
Find
those
by
the
creek,
did
you?
They're
nightshade
berries.
Mmm.
They're
poisonous.

Where
did
you
get
this
water?



-

Come
on.
Breakfast.

Oh,
wait.
A
princess
should
not
Uh-huh...

There
you
go.
Go
on.

How
do
you
know
you
don't
like
it


Mm.





This
love
it
is
a
distant
star
Guiding
us
home
wherever
we
are
This
love
it
is
a
burning
sun
Shining
light
on
the
things
I
tried
to
speak
to
you
every
day
But
each
word
we
spoke
How
did
we
let
it
come
to
this?
What
we
just
tasted...

How
will
it
feel
when
this
day
is
done?
And
can
we
keep

Could
these
walls
I
want
to
feel
my
feet
on
the
ground
Can
we
carry
this
love
that
we
share
Into
the
open
air
Into
the
open
air
Hey!
Where
are
you
going?
This
love
it
is
a
burning
sun
Mum,
come
back.

-
Uh...
-
Oh...
Mum,
is
that
you?

Uh...
Mum?

You
changed.
Like
you
were
a...
I
mean,
like
you
were
a
bear


A
wisp.
-
Mum!
Stop
it!
Mum,
no!

Mum...

-

Mum,
I
know
you're
scared,
you're
tired,
you
don't
understand,
but
we've
got
to
keep
our
heads.
Just
calm
down.
Listen.



They'll
show
us
the
way.


MERIDA:
Mum,
look.


MERIDA:
Why
did
the
wisps


Whoever
they
were,


-

Just
fine.
It's,
uh,
a
throne
room.
You
suppose
this
could've
in
that
story
you
were
telling
me?
-


One,
two,
three,
four.
The
oldest.

Split,
like
the
tapestry.


The
spell.
It's
happened
before.
"Strength
of
ten
men.
"
"Fate
be
changed.
"
"Changed
his
fate.
"
Oh,
no.
The
prince
became...

-
Mor'du.



-

-







Mum,
we
need
to
get
back
to
the
castle.
If
we
don't
hurry,
A
bear!
A
real
bear.
Forever!
-

The
witch
gave
us
the
answer.
-



That'll
do.


No
more
talk.
No
more
traditions.
We
settle
this
now!
You're
the
King.
You
decide
which
one
of
our
sons
None
of
your
sons
Then
our
alliance
is
over!

They're
gonna
murder
each
other.
You've
got
to
stop
them

I
know,
I
know!
But
how
do
we
get
you
through
there
with
the
lot
of
them
"Oh!


-
What
are
you
doing,
lass?

I,
um...
I
have...
“.
Well,
you
see,
I...
I
have
been
in
conference
-
Is
that
so?
-
Well,
where
is
she,
then?
How
do
we
know
that
-
I'd
never...
-
What
are
you
playing
at?
LORD
MACINTOSH:
We
will
not
stand
-
That's
right.
Let's
see
her.



Well,
I,
uh...
Uh...
Once
there
was
an
ancient
kingdom.
What
is
this?
That
kingdom
fell
into
war
and
chaos
and
ruin...
Och,
we've
all
heard
that
tale.
Aye,
but
it's
true.
I
know
now
how
one
selfish
act
LORD
MACGUFFIN:
Legends
are
lessons.
They
ring
with
truths.
Our
kingdom
is
young.
Our
stories
are
not
yet
legend.
But
in
them,
our
bond
was
struck.
Our
clans
were
once
enemies.
But
when
invaders
threatened
us
you
joined
together
to
defend
our
lands.
You
fought
for
each
other.
You
risked
everything
for
each
other.
Lord
MacGuffin,
my
dad
saved
your
life,
stopping
an
arrow
Aye,
and
I'll
never
forget
it.
MERIDA:
And,
Lord
Macintosh,
you
saved
my
dad
and
held
off
the
advance.
And
we
all
know
how
Lord
Dingwall
With
a
mighty
throw
of
his
spear!
I
was
aiming
at
you,
you
big
tumshie.

The
story
of
this
kingdom
My
dad
rallied
your
forces
and
you
made
him
your
king.
It
was
an
alliance
forged
in
bravery
and
it
lives
to
this
day.

But
I've
been
selfish.
I
tore
a
great
rift
in
our
kingdom.
There's
no
one
to
blame
but
me.
And
I
know
now
and
mend
our
bond.
And
so,
there
is
the
matter
I've
decided
to
do
what's
right
and...
...and...
...and...
...break
tradition.

My
mother...
...the
Queen,
feels...
...uh,
in
her
heart
that
I...
...that
we
be
free
to...
...write
our
own
story...
...follow
our
hearts
and
find
love
in
our
own
time.
-
That's

beautiful.
The
Queen
and
I
put
the
decision
Might
our
young
people
decide
Huh?
Well,
since
you've
obviously
I
have
one
thing
to
say.
-
This
is...
Give
us
our
own
say
-
What?
But
she's
the
princess.
I
did
not
pick
her
out.
It
was
your
idea.
And
you...
You
feel
the
same
way?

-
Good?

Well,
that
settles
it.
Let
these
lads
try
and
win
her
heart
If
they
can.
I
say,
the
wee
Dingwall
Fine,
then.
Seems
for
once
we
agree.
-
It
was
my
idea
in
the
first
place.


Just
like
your
mum.
You
devil.

Uh...
Everyone
to
the
cellar!
Let's
crack
open
the
King's

Oh.

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Psst.
Bring
the
tiny
glasses.




Oh,
the
tapestry!
Mend
the
bond...
Mend
the
bond.
Stitch
it
up.
This'll
change
you
back.
We
just
need
needle
and
thread.


-
Mum?
Mum?
Not
now.
No.
Please,
not
now.

-
Mum...
-


Elinor,
dear,
you'll
never
guess
-

Elinor!
It
can't
be
true!
Elinor!
-
Merida.
-
What?
-
Merida,
get
back!


No,
Dad!
Don't
hurt
her!
-
Get
out
of
here!
Merida!
No!


-
No!


-
Mum.

It's
all
right.
I'm
all
right.
It's
nothing.
-
My
liege!
Fergus.
-
Bear!
Dad!
Count
your
stars,
lass.
It's
your
wife,
Elinor.
-

Close
the
gate!
-
You're
talking
nonsense!
There
was
a
witch
and
she
Mor'du
or
not,
I'll
avenge
your
mother!
-
I'll
not
risk
losing
you,
too.
Listen!
You
can't!
-
It's
your
wife
Elinor!
-
What
about
the
bear?

Oh...




Come
on,
you
sorry
bunch
of
galoots!
Mum!
No.
No.
Mum.


Maudie.
Maudie!
I
need
you!
Now!

Oh,
no.
Maudie.

Get
the
key.


Yah!

Oh,
Maudie!


Needle
and
thread.
Needle
and
thread.



There
he
goes!
Needle
and
thread.
Ah.
you
beauty!





One,
two...
Huh?

{THUD)




Steady,
Hamish.
FERGUS:
There
he
goes.
-



FERGUS:
We've
got
his
track!
-

-
Back,back,back!

Angus!
Easy,
laddie.

Hubert,
Harris,
help
Hamish.

FERGUS:
Watch
your
blade!
Aye,
we've
got
you
now!
-
FERGUS:
Give
me
a
hand
over
here!
LORD
DINGWALL:
LORD
MACGUFFIN:

Done!


Yah!

-


-
Hah!



-
Get
back.
That's
my
mother.
-
Mum,
are
you
hurt?


Merida!
-

-


Boys?


-
Mor'du!
-


You
scoundrel!


Come
on!









Mum!











The
second
sunrise.




No...
I
don't
understand.
I...


Oh,
Mum,
I'm
sorry.
This
is
all
my
fault.
I
did
this
to
you.
To
us.

You've
always
been
there
for
me.
You've
never
given
up
on
me.
I
just
want
you
back.

I
want
you
back,
Mummy.
I
love
you.


Mum!
You're
back!

You
changed!
Oh,
darling,
we
both
have.
Elinor!
Oh,
Oh,
Oh!

Elinor!
Oh!
Ah!
Er...
Urgh!
Oh,
dear.
You're
back.
She
came
back
to
us.
It's
a
great
day
for
this
kingdom.
Oh!
Mum.
Ooh.
Erm...
Dear?
-
Eh?
Naked
as
a
wee
babby.
Don't
just
stare
at
me.
Do
something!
What
the...
Avert
your
eyes,
lads!
Show
some
respect!


Now
that's
what
I
call

Merida,
Elinor,
hurry
up.
-
Mum!
We've
got
to
wave
them
off!

Though
I
may
speak
Or
even
spit
out
some
holy
word

I
have
no
strength
with
which
to
speak
Oof!

When
you
sit
me
down

Goodbye!
All
the
best!
We
will
run
and
scream
You
will
dance
with
me
But
how
did
this...


MERIDA:
There
are
those
who
say
fate
that
destiny
is
not
our
own.
But
I
know
better.
Our
fate
lives
within
us.
You
only
have
to
be
brave
enough

We
will
run
and
scream
You
will
dance
with
me
We'll
fulfill
our
dreams
We
will
be
who
we
are
And
then
heal
our
scars
Sadness
will
be
far
away
So
I
had
done
wrong
But
you
put
me
right
My
judgment
burned
When
I
give
less
than
I
take
It
is
my
fault,
my
own
mistake
We
will
run
and
scream
You
will
dance
with
me
We'll
fulfill
our
dreams
We
will
be
who
we
are
And
then
heal
our
scars
Sadness
will
be
far
away
