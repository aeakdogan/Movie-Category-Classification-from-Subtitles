I've
got
one!

I've
got
a
fish,
Sméag.
Sméagol!
Pull
it
in.
Go
on.
Go
on.
Go
on.

SMÉAGOL:

[BIRDS
SQUAWKING,
SMÉAGOL:

Déagol.
Give
us
that,
Déagol,
my
love.
Why?
Because...
...it's
my
birthday
and
I
wants
it.





[VOICE
OF
THE
RING
My
precious.

GOLLUM:

"Murderer"
they
called
us.
They
cursed
us
Gollum.


And
we
wept,
precious.
We
wept
to
be
so
alone.

-
And
cool
And
we
only
wish
So
juicy
sweet
And
we
forgot
the
taste
of
bread...
...the
sound
of
trees...
...the
softness
of
the
wind.
We
even
forgot
our
own
name.
My
precious.


Wake
up!
Wake
up,
sleepies.
We
must
go,
yes.
We
must
go
at
once.
Haven't
you
had
any
sleep,
Mr.
Frodo?
I've
gone
and
had
too
much.
Must
be
getting
late.
FRODO:
It
isn't.
It
isn't
midday
yet.
The
days
are
growing
darker.

Come
on!
Must
go!
No
time!
Not
before
Mr.
Frodo's
No
time
to
lose,
silly.
SAM:
What
about
you?
Oh,
no,
I'm
not
hungry.
Sam.
All
right.
We
don't
have
that
much
left.
We
have
to
be
careful
You
go
ahead
and
eat
that,
Mr.
Frodo.
I've
rationed
it.
There
should
be
enough.
For
what?
The
journey
home.
Come,
Hobbitses.
Very
close
now.
Very
close
to
Mordor.
No
safe
places
here.
Hurry.

PIPPIN:
I
feel
like
I'm
back
at
...after
a
hard
day's
work.
MERRY:
Only,
you've
never
done


Welcome,
my
lords...
...to
Isengard!
You
young
rascals!
...and
now
we
find
you
feasting
We
are
sitting
...enjoying
a
few
well-earned
comforts.
The
salted
pork
is
particularly
good.
Salted
pork?
-
Huh.
Hobbits.
...who's
taken
over
management
TREEBEARD:
I'm
glad
you've
come.
Wood
and
water,
stock
and
stone
But
there
is
a
wizard
to
manage
here...
...locked
in
his
tower.
And
there
Saruman
must
remain
Well,
let's
just
have
his
head
No.
He
has
no
power
anymore.
The
filth
of
Saruman...
...is
washing
away.
Trees
will
come
back
to
live
here.
Young
trees.
-
Wild
trees.
Bless
my
bark!
GANDALF:
I'll
take
that,
my
lad.
Quickly,
now.
THÉODEN:
Tonight
we
remember
...to
defend
this
country.
Hail
the
victorious
dead.
ALL:


THÉODEN:
He
is
an
honorable
man.
You
are
both
honorable
men.
It
was
not
Théoden
of
Rohan
Ah,
don't
listen
to
me.
You
are
young.
And
tonight
is
for
you.

Oh,
you
can
search
far
and
wide
But
you'll
never
find
a
beer
so
brown
As
the
one
we
drink
in
our
hometown
You
can
drink
your
fancy
ales
But
the
only
brew
for
the
brave
and
true
Comes
from
The
Green
Dragon

MERRY:
No
news
of
Frodo?
No
word.
Nothing.
We
have
time.
Every
day,
Frodo
moves
closer
to
Mordor.
Do
we
know
that?
What
does
your
heart
tell
you?
That
Frodo
is
alive.
Yes.
Yes,
he's
alive.
GOLLUM:
Thieves.
They
stole
it
from
us.
Kill
them.
Kill
them.
Kill
them
both.

Shh!
Quiet!
Mustn't
wake
them.
Mustn't
ruin
it
now.
But
they
knows.
They
knows.
They
suspects
us.
What's
it
saying,
my
precious,
my
love?
Is
Sméagol
losing
his
nerve?
No.
Not.
Never.
Sméagol
hates
nasty
Hobbitses.
Sméagol
wants
to
see
them
dead.
And
we
will.
Sméagol
did
it
once.
It's
ours!
Ours!
We
must
get
the
precious.
Patience!
Patience,
my
love.
First
we
must
lead
them
to
her.
We
lead
them
to
the
Winding
Stair.
Yes,
the
stairs.
And
then?
Up,
up,
up,
up,
...until
we
come
to
the
tunnel.
And
when
they
go
in...
...there's
no
coming
out.
She's
always
hungry.
She
always
needs
to
feed.
She
must
eat.
All
she
gets
is
filthy
Orcses.
And
they
doesn't
taste
very
nice,
No.
Not
very
nice
at
all,
my
love.
She
hungers
for
sweeter
meats.
Hobbit
meat.
And
when
she
throws
away
the
bones
...then
we
will
find
it.
And
take
it
for
me!
For
us.
Yes.
We
meant
"for
us."
Gollum.
Gollum.
The
precious
will
be
ours...
...once
the
Hobbitses
are
dead!
You
treacherous
little
toad!

No!
No!
Master!
No,
Sam!
Leave
him
alone!
I
heard
it
from
his
own
mouth.
Never!
Sméagol
wouldn't
hurt
a
fly.

He's
a
horrid,
fat
Hobbit...
...who
hates
Sméagol...
...and
who
makes
up
nasty
lies.
You
miserable
little
maggot!
Sam!
SAM:

-
You
scare
him
off,
we're
lost!
-
I
won't
wait
around
for
him
to
kill
us!
SAM:
He's
a
villain.
We
can't
do
this
by
ourselves,
Sam.
I
need
you
on
my
side.
I'm
on
your
side,
Mr.
Frodo.
I
know,
Sam.
I
know.
Trust
me.
Come,
Sméagol.
The
stars
are
veiled.
Something
stirs
in
the
east.
A
sleepless
malice.
The
Eye
of
the
enemy
is
moving.
MERRY:

MERRY
:
Pippin?

Pippin.
-
What,
are
you
mad?
Just
one
more
time.
MERRY:

Pippin.

No!

Pippin.

He
is
here.
SAURON:
Pippin!
[SAURON
SPEAKING

MERRY:
Someone
help
him!
Pippin!
Fool
of
a
Took!


Look
at
me.
Gandalf,
forgive
me.
GANDALF:
What
did
you
see?
A
tree.
There
was
a
white
tree...
...in
a
courtyard
of
stone.
It
was
dead.
The
city
was
burning.
Minas
Tirith?
Is
that
what
you
saw?
I
saw...
I
saw
him.
I
could
hear
his
voice
in
my
head.
And
what
did
you
tell
him?
Speak!
He
asked
me
my
name.
He
hurt
me.
What
did
you
tell
him
There
was
no
lie
in
Pippin's
eyes.
A
fool...
...but
an
honest
fool
he
remains.
He
told
Sauron
nothing
We've
been
strangely
fortunate.
Pippin
saw
in
the
palantír
Sauron
moves
to
strike
His
defeat
at
Helm's
Deep
He
knows
the
heir
of
Elendil
Men
are
not
as
weak
as
he
supposed.
There
is
courage
still,
strength
Sauron
fears
this.
He
will
not
risk
the
peoples
of
He
will
raze
Minas
Tirith
...before
he
sees
a
king
If
the
beacons
of
Gondor
are
lit,
Tell
me...
...why
should
we
ride
to
the
aid...
...of
those
who
did
not
come
to
ours?
What
do
we
owe
Gondor?
-
I
will
go.
-
They
must
be
warned.
You
must
come
to
Minas
Tirith
Follow
the
river
Understand
this:
Things
are
now
in
motion
I
ride
for
Minas
Tirith...
...and
I
won't
be
going
alone.
Of
all
the
inquisitive
Hobbits,
Hurry!
Hurry!
Where
are
we
going?
Why
did
you
look?
Why
do
you
always
have
to
look?
-
I
don't
know.
I
can't
help
it.
I'm
sorry,
all
right?
-
I
won't
do
it
again.
The
enemy
thinks
you
have
the
Ring.
He's
going
to
be
looking
for
you,
Pip.
And
you...?
You're
coming
with
me?
Merry?
Come
on.
How
far
is
Minas
Tirith?
Three
days'
ride,
as
the
Nazgûl
flies.
And
you
better
hope
we
don't
have
Here.
Something
for
the
road.
The
last
of
the
Longbottom
Leaf.
I
know
you've
run
out.
But...
But
we'll
see
each
other
soon.
-
Won't
we?

-
Merry.
Show
us
the
meaning
of
haste.
Merry!
ELROND:
A
ship
lies
anchored
It
waits
to
carry
her
across
the
sea.
The
last
journey
of
Arwen
Undómiel.

There
is
nothing
for
you
here...
...only
death.

ESCORT:
...we
cannot
delay.
My
lady!
ARWEN:
Tell
me
what
you
have
seen.
ARWEN:
What
did
you
see?
I
looked
into
your
future,
But
there
is
also
life.
You
saw
there
was
a
child.
ELROND:
But
it
is
not
lost.
Nothing
is
certain.
Some
things
are
certain.
If
I
leave
him
now...
...I
will
regret
it
forever.
It
is
time.

light
from
the
shadow
shall
spring
Renewed
shall
be

that
was
broken

The
crownless
again
shall
be

the
sword.

ELROND:
The
life
of
the
Eldar
is
leaving
you.
This
was
my
choice.

Whether
by
your
will
or
not...
...there
is
no
ship
now
We've
just
passed
Minas
Tirith.
City
of
kings.
Make
way!
It's
the
tree.

GANDALF:
The
tree
of
the

Lord
Denethor,
however,
He
is
a

Now
listen
carefully.
To
give
him
news
of
his
beloved
son's
And
do
not
mention
Frodo
or
the

And
say
nothing
of

either.
In

it's
better
if

Hail
Denethor,
son
of
Ecthelion,
I
come
with
tidings
in
this
dark
hour,
Perhaps
you
come
to
explain
this.
Perhaps
you
come
to
tell
me



Boromir
died
to
save
us...
...my
kinsman
and
me.
-
He
fell
defending
us
from
many
foes.
I
offer
you
my
service,
such
as
it
is...
...in
payment
of
this
debt.
Get
up.
My
lord,
there
will
be
a
time
...but
it
is
not
now.
War
is
coming.
The
enemy
is
on
your
doorstep.
...with
the
defense
of
this
city.
You
still
have
friends.
Send
word
to
Théoden
of
Rohan.
You
think
you
are
wise,
Mithrandir.
Yet
for
all
your
subtleties,
Do
you
think
the
eyes
I
have
seen
more
than
you
know.
With
your
left
hand
you
would
use
me
And
with
your
right
I
know
who
rides
with
Théoden
of
Rohan.
Oh,
yes.
Word
has
reached
my
ears
And
I
tell
you
now,
I
will
not
bow
...last
of
a
ragged
house
Authority
is
not
given
to
you
The
rule
of
Gondor
is
mine
GANDALF:
So
I
imagine
this
is
just
I
mean,
they
don't
actually
expect
me
-
Do
they?
You're
going
to
have
to
do
GANDALF:
It's
so
quiet.
It's
the
deep
breath
before
the
plunge.
I
don't
want
to
be
in
a
battle...
...but
waiting
on
the
edge
of
one

Is
there
any
hope,
Gandalf,
GANDALF:
Just
a
fool's
hope.
Our
enemy
is
ready.
His
full
strength's
gathered.
Not
only
Orcs,
but
Men
as
well.
Legions
of
Haradrim
from
the
south...
...mercenaries
from
the
coast.
All
will
answer
Mordor's
call.
MAN:
This
will
be
the
end
of
Gondor
Here
the
hammer
stroke
will
fall
hardest.
If
the
river
is
taken,
...the
last
defense
of
this
city
But
we
have
the
White
Wizard.
Gandalf?
GANDALF:
Sauron
has
yet
to
reveal
...the
one
who
will
lead
The
one
they
say
no
living
man
can
kill.
The
Witch-king
of
Angmar.
You've
met
him
before.
He
stabbed
Frodo
on
Weathertop.

He
is
the
lord
of
the
Nazgûl...
...the
greatest
of
the
Nine.
Minas
Morgul...
...is
his
lair.

Very
nasty
place.
Full
of
enemies.
Quick.
Quick.

will
see.

will
see.
Come
away.
Come
away.

way
into
Mordor.
The
secret
stair.
Climb.


-
No,
Mr.
Frodo!

GOLLUM:
What's
it
doing?
-
They're
calling
me.


GOLLUM:




I
can
feel
his
blade.
We
come
to
it
at
last.
The
great
battle
of
our
time.


Come
away,
Hobbits.
The
board
is
set.
The
pieces
are
moving.
Peregrin
Took,
my
lad,
Another
opportunity
for
one
You
must
not
fail
me.
Quiet.
-
To
the

Quick.
Quick.
Come
on.
Faster.
Draw
swords.

What?
Amon
Dîn.
GUARD:
The
beacon.
Hope
is
kindled.
ARAGORN:
The
beacons
of
Minas
Tirith!
Gondor
calls
for
aid.
And
Rohan
will
answer.
Muster
the
Rohirrim.

Assemble
the
army
at
Dunharrow.
As
many
men
as
can
be
found.
On
the
third,

1:
Forward.

Gamling.
Make
haste
Summon
every
able-bodied

I
will.

Will
you
ride
with
us?
It's
tradition
for
the
women
The
men
have
found
their
captain.
They
will
follow
you
into
battle,
You
have
given
us
hope.
THÉODEN:
So
it
is
before
the
walls
...the
doom
of
our
time
will
be
decided.
Now
is
the
hour.
Now,
fulfill
them
all.

can't
hold
them.

is

It's
coming!

FARAMIR:
They
broke
through
our
defenses.
They've
taken
the
bridge
Battalions
of

crossing
the
river.

-
Long
has

foreseen
this
doom.
Faramir?
This
is
not
the
first

No.
You've
seen
Frodo
and
Sam?
-
Where?
When?
Not
two
days
ago.
Gandalf,
they're
taking
the
road
And
then
the
pass
of
Cirith
Ungol.
What
does
that
mean?
-
What's
wrong?

GOLLUM:
Very
far
to
fall.
Very
dangerous
are
the
stairs.
Come,
master.
Come
to
Sméagol.
SAM:
Get
back,
you!
Don't
touch
him!
Why
does
he
hates
poor
Sméagol?
What
has
Sméagol
ever
done
to
him?
Master?

Master
carries
heavy
burden.
Sméagol
knows.
Fat
one
cannot
know.
Sméagol
look
after
master.
He
wants
it.
He
needs
it.
Very
soon
he
will
ask
you
for
it.
The
fat
one
will
take
it
from
you.

Do
not
stop
the
attack
Slay
them
all.

What
of

Will
Rohan's
army
come?

Sneaking
off,
are
we?
Sneaking?
Sneaking?!
Fat
Hobbit
is
always
so
polite.
Sméagol
shows
them
secret
ways
...and
they
say
"sneak."
Sneak?
Very
nice
friend.
-
Very
nice,
very
nice.
You
just
startled
me
is
all.
What
were
you
doing?
Sneaking.
Fine.
Have
it
your
own
way.
I'm
sorry
to
wake
you,
Mr.
Frodo.
We
have
to
be
moving
on.
It's
dark
still.
It's
always
dark
here.
It's
gone!
-
The
Elven
bread.
That's
all
we
have
left.

He
took
it.
He
must
have!
Sméagol?
Sméagol
hates
nasty
Elf
bread.
You're
a
lying
wretch!
He
doesn't
eat
it.
-
He
can't
have
taken
it.
What's
this?
Crumbs
on
his
jacketses.
He
took
it.

not
looking.
You

FRODO:

Sam!

I'll
kill
him!
Oh,

...they're
moving
off.
You
see,
Mr.
Frodo...
...some
luck
at
last.


Take
mine.
There's
a
few
drops
left.
There
will
be
none
left
I
don't
think
there
will
be

Frodo,
get
down!
Hide!

Frodo!
Where
are
they?
Let
the
Lord
of
the
Black
Land
come
forth!
Let
justice
be
done
upon
him!


Fall
back.
Fall
back!

SAM:
The
light's
passed
on,
Something's
drawn
its
gaze.
Hold
your
ground!
Hold
your
ground.
Sons
of
Gondor,
of
Rohan,
my
brothers!
I
see
in
your
eyes...
...the
same
fear
that
would
take
A
day
may
come
...when
we
forsake
our
friends
But
it
is
not
this
day.
An
hour
of
wolves
...when
the
age
of
Men
But
it
is
not
this
day.
This
day
we
fight!
By
all
that
you
hold
dear
...I
bid
you
stand,
Men
of
the
West!


Never
thought
I'd
die
fighting
What
about
side
by
side
with
a
friend?
Aye.
I
could
do
that.
Do
you
remember
the
Shire,
Lt'll
be
spring
soon.
And
the
orchards
will
be
in
blossom.
And
the
birds
will
be
nesting
And
they'll
be
sowing
...and
eating
the
first
Do
you
remember

I
can't
recall
the
taste
of
food...
...nor
the
sound
of
water...
...nor
the
touch
of
grass.
I'm...
...naked
in
the
dark.
There's...
There's
nothing.
No
veil
between
me
I
can
see
him...
...with
my
waking
eyes.
Then
let
us
be
rid
of
it...
...once
and
for
all.
Come
on,
Mr.
Frodo.
I
can't
carry
it
for
you...
...but
I
can
carry
you.
Come
on!

SAURON:

Elessar.
For
Frodo.

Look,
Mr.
Frodo.
A
doorway.
We're
almost
there.
Clever
Hobbits
to
climb
so
high!



[RINGWRAITHS
SCREECHING,


Frodo!

Eagles.
The
eagles
are
coming!
Frodo!
I'm
here,
Sam.
Destroy
it!
Go
on!
Now!
Throw
it
in
the
fire!

What
are
you
waiting
for?
Just
let
it
go!

The
Ring
is
mine.
No.
No!








GOLLUM:
Yes!
Precious!
Precious!


Give
me
your
hand!
Take
my
hand!
No!
Don't
you
let
go.
Don't
let
go.
Reach!


Frodo!


It's
gone.
It's
done.
Yes,
Mr.
Frodo.
It's
over
now.



I
can
see
the
Shire.
The
Brandywine
River.
Bag
End.
Gandalf's
fireworks.
The
lights
in
the
Party
Tree.
Rosie
Cotton
dancing.
She
had
ribbons
in
her
hair.
If
ever
I
was
to
marry
someone...
...it
would've
been
her.
It
would've
been
her.

I'm
glad
to
be
with
you,
...here
at
the
end
of
all
things.


Gandalf?

Frodo!


Gimli!


Now
come
the
days
of
the
king.
May
they
be
blessed.


This
day
does
not
belong
to
one
man...
...but
to
all.
Let
us
together
rebuild
this
world...
...that
we
may
share




My
friends...
...you
bow
to
no
one.
FRODO:
A
Fourth
Age
of
Middle-earth
began.
And
the
Fellowship
of
the
Ring...
...though
eternally
bound
...was
ended.
Thirteen
months
to
the
day
since
Gandalf
...we
found
ourselves
We
were
home.
Hi.

Good

FRODO:
How
do
you
pick
up
How
do
you
go
on...
...when
in
your
heart
...there
is
no
going
back?
There
are
some
things
...some
hurts
that
go
too
deep...
...that
have
taken
hold.


Mr.
Frodo?
What
is
it?
It's
been
four
years
to
the
day
It's
never
really
healed.
"There
and
Back
Again:
A
Hobbit's
Tale
And
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
You
finished
it.
FRODO:
There's
room
for
a
little
more.
Bilbo
once
told
me
his
part
...that
each
of
us
must
come
and
go
Bilbo's
story
was
now
over.
There
would
be
no
more
journeys
...save
one.
BILBO
:
FRODO:
The
Elves
have
accorded
you
...a
place
on
the
last
ship
Frodo...
...any
chance
of
seeing
The
one
I
gave
you.
Sorry,
Uncle.
I'm
afraid
I
lost
it.
Oh.
Pity.
I
should
like
to
have
held
it

Oh!
Well,
here's
a
sight
The
power
of
the
Three
Rings
is
ended.
The
time
has
come...
...for
the
dominion
of
Men.

I
think
I'm...
...quite
ready
Farewell...
...my
brave
Hobbits.
My
work
is
now
finished.
Here
at
last,
...comes
the
end
of
our
Fellowship.
I
will
not
say,
"Do
not
weep"...
...for
not
all
tears
are
an
evil.
It
is
time,
Frodo.
SAM:
We
set
out
to
save
the
Shire,
Sam.
And
it
has
been
saved.
But
not
for
me.
You
don't
mean
that.
You
can't
leave.
The
last
pages
are
for
you,
Sam.

FRODO:
You
cannot
always
be
torn
in
two.
You
will
have
to
be
one
and
whole
You
have
so
much
to
enjoy
Your
part
in
the
story
will
go
on.
Well...
...l'm
back.

SINGING
Lay
down
Your
sweet
and
weary
head
Night
is
falling
You
have
come
Sleep
now
And
dream
They
are
calling
From
across
Why
do
you
weep?
What
are
these
tears
Soon
you
will
see
All
of
your
fears
Safe
in
my
arms
You're
only
sleeping
What
can
you
see
On
the
horizon?
Why
do
the
white
gulls
Call?
Across
the
sea
A
pale
moon
rises
The
ships
have
come
To
carry
you
home
And
all
will
turn
To
silver
glass
A
light
on
the
water
All
souls
pass
Hope
fades
Into
the
world
of
night
Through
shadows
falling
Out
of
memory
and
time
Don't
say
We
have
come
now
to
the
end
White
shores
are
calling
You
and
I
will
meet
again
And
you'll
be
here
Just
sleeping
What
can
you
see
On
the
horizon?
Why
do
the
white
gulls
Call?
Across
the
sea
A
pale
moon
rises
The
ships
have
come
To
carry
you
home
And
all
will
turn
To
silver
glass
A
light
on
the
water
Grey
ships
pass
Into
