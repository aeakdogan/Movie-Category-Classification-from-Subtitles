Come

Did
we

Would

No,

{y:i}RECORDING:
Good
morning,
Mr
Phelps.
{y:i}The
man
you're
looking
{y:i}an
attach
at
our
embassy
{y:i}He
is
also
a
traitor.
{y:i}He
has
stolen
half
{y:i}a

of
all
our

{y:i}For
security
reasons,
{y:i}The
portion
that
Golitsyn

matches
the
code

{y:i}It
is
this
half
which
Golitsyn
{y:i}during
a
reception
tomorrow

{y:i}Your
mission,
Jim,
{y:i}is
to
obtain

A
very
straightforward
objective:
we
photograph
Golitsyn
follow
him
to
his
buyer,
apprehend
both
of
them.
Now
here's
the
plot.
Ethan,
you're

Hide
in

Are
you
game?
Sarah,
you're
at
the

Make

with
Ethan.
I

Well,

That's

Any
questions?
Yeah.
Can

get
a
cappuccino
JACK:
I
call
it
cruel
and
unusual.
Exactly.
It's
even
worse
Take
it
easy
on
my
wife's
coffee.
-
We
missed
you
in
Kiev,
Jim.

On

Ooh!
JACK:

So,
I'll
run

Let's
punch
out
the
details.
There's
a

Whatever
you
see,

See?
Can
you
hear
me?
No,
in

Oh.
You

Loud

If

They're

We're

He's

Not

This

Yup.

Of

Uh,
we

An

constantly

{y:i}We
were
forced
to
tie
him
{y:i}and
drag
him
around

a

Relax

I'm
working
on

Sorry,

Thank
you.
Ah.
That

with
Sarah
Higher.
He's
heading
to
the

Get
moving,
Ethan.
Jack.
Jack,
we're
in

here.
{y:i}ETHAN:
Jack.
I
didn't
touch
it.
-
Where's
my
coat?

He's
in
the
box,
Ethan.
-
OK.
Open
these
doors.
I'm
opening
the
doors.
Go
under.
Go!
He's
got
it.
All
right.
Saved
your
ass
again,
Jack.
{y:i}JACK:
Give
me
a
break,
pops.
Such
a
nice

And
a
lonely

Transport

Yes,

Jack,
we're

Open

Opening

{y:i}ETHAN:
Go
to

Hey.
-
Jack,
what
are
you
doing?
I
don't
have
control,
Jack.
-
Then
I
got
a
problem.
-
Cut
the
power.
Cut
the
power.
Jack?
Jack?
ETHAN:
Jack?
Jack?
Jack?
{y:i}ETHAN:
Jack,
do
you
copy?
Jack?
Man
down,
Ethan.
Man
down.
{y:i}JIM:
Ethan,
stay
where
you
are.
I'm
coming
to
you.

The
package
is
in
the

Jim.
{y:i}-
ETHAN:
He's
in

Jim,
he's
in
the

Jim,
the
package
is
in
the
open.
-
I've
got
a
shadow.
No.
Abort.
He's
out
of
pocket.
I
can't
do
that.
We're
being
ambushed,
Ethan.
Negative.
Golitsyn
is
on
the
move.
{y:i}JIM:
No,
damn
it!
No!
I
said
abort!
Sarah,
eye
on
the
package.
Jim
gave
an
abort.
Walk
away.
We
are
going
to
recover
that
disk.
Now,
go!

Where
are
you?
About
200
yards
from

{y:i}JIM:
They're

Cut

I'VE

You
seem

Who

Yeah.
I
see
your

Why
was
there

What?
Of

I
don't

Well,

You're

about

Why?
Well,
for
a
little
over
two
years,
we've
been
spotting
We
have
a
penetration.
The
other
day,
we
decoded
a
message
from
a
Czech
we
know
as
"Max".
The
arms
dealer.
That's
right.
Max,
it
seems,
a
capacity
for
anonymity
and
for
corrupting
This
time,
he'd
gotten
He'd
gotten
in

he
referred
to
the
job
he
thought
But
the

Golitsyn
stole
That's
correct.
The

Golitsyn
was
a
lightning
rod.
This
whole
operation
This
whole
operation
Yeah.
The
mole's
deep
inside...
and
like
you
said...
you
survived.
I
want
to
show
you
something,
Ethan.
Since
your
father's
death,
your
family's
farm
and
now,
suddenly,
they're
flush
Your
father's
illness
was
supposed
Dying
slowly
in
America,
after
all,
So...
why
don't
we
quietly
I
understand
you're
upset.
Kittridge,
All
right,
Hunt.
Enough
is
enough.
You
have
bribed,
cajoled,
and
you've
done
it
from
the
inside.
You
want
to
court
the
devil,
fine.


Money,
money.

Ethan...
what
are
you
doing?
I
needed
you,
Ethan.
but
you
weren't
there.
Ethan...
Ethan...
CLAIRE:
Ethan?
Don't
move.
Ethan...
Ethan,
it's
OK.
Just
calm
down.
You
were
in
the
car.
No,
I
wasn't.
I
heard
on
the
radio...
Shut
up!
I
saw
you.
No,
I
got
out
of
the
car.
I
ran
to
the
bridge.
Don't
give
me
that.
I
was
there.
-
What
happened
to
Jim?
They're
dead!
They're
all
dead!
-
Who
sent
you
for
me?
-
Who
sent
you
here?
Take
off
your
coat.
Where
were
you,
huh?
-
I...
I
walked
away.
He
said
abort.
That
was
four
hours
ago.
-
Did
they
send
you?
-
Look,
who
sent
you?
We
were
supposed
to
be
back
here
If
we
abort,
we
don't
return
4
o'clock,
Ethan.
4.00...
If
we
abort...
4am...

I've
been
disavowed.
They
actually
think
I
killed
Jim
Somehow
$100,000
finds
its
way
Kittridge
assumes
I'm
the
mole
and
I've
been
in
the
employ
for
the
last
two
years...
-
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Ethan,
you're
not
making
any
sense.
Whoever
the
mole
is
I
can't
find
him,
he'll
find
me.
I'm
going
in
and
telling
Kittridge
Claire,
if
you're
not
dead,

The
message
is
for
Job.
That's
right...
and
I'm
going
to
answer
it.
ETHAN:
Excuse
me.
Could
you
remove
your
hat,
please?
ETHAN:
Why?
You
wish
to
meet
Max?
The
price
of
admission.
ETHAN:
DRIVER:
ETHAN:
DRIVER:
Allowing
Max
to
see
you
I
don't

If
Max
doesn't
like
you'll
be
wearing
that
shroud
I'm
willing
to
take
the
chance.
Very
well.
Who
are
you
I
need
$150,000.

Oh,
really?
You...you...
You
thought
if
you
simply
Why
not?
You
gave
Job
125.
Hmm...
the
penny
drops.
Job
is
not
given
to
quoting
scripture
Then
there
was
its
tone,
aggressive
but
playful.
Job
is
not
playful.
So
you
are
something
of
a
paradox.
Well,
that
depends.
On
what?
Whether
you
like
a
paradox.
I
want
$150,000
today.
That's
quite
out
of
the
question.
The
disk
Job
sold
you...
it's
worthless.
It's
bait...
And
how
might
you
know
that?
Are
you
another
company
man?
Like
Job?
Hmm...
We're
asking
about
you.
I'm
NOC...
Was...
Now
disavowed.
Why,
may
I
ask?
That
is
the
question
I
don't
know
Job
Even
so...
I'm
sure
you
could
arrange
Why
should
I?
I
can
deliver
the
actual

The

you
have
is

OK.

pack

See,
there's

It's

we
call

I'll

It's

ETHAN:
The

This

Next,
he

finally,

ETHAN:
Now,

you

Can

No,
thank
you.
GUARD:
21's

KITTRIDGE:

Survival.
Too
short-sighted.
The
question
is,
what
does
he
want?
Barnes,
what's
that
noise?
Uh,
the
fire
alarm,
Gene.
Do
we
have
to
evacuate?

Hey,
there
were
three
of
you.
Zero

We'll
see.

Hi,
there.
One.
Two.
Three.
Toast.
Toast.
{y:i}LUTHER:
Check.
Good.
OK,
Luther,
I'm
going
in.

man.
{y:i}You
ready

Damn.
Krieger,

He's

He's
at

William

Outer

He's
coming
in

Come
on,
move.




DONLOE:
Oh...
Oh...
He's
in

A-W-9...
{y:i}6-B-6.
Holy

{y:i}The

He's
at

Four

One

Get
moving.
LUTHER:
Toast.
Toast.
Merci.

Oh,
my
God.
Yeah.
It's...for
you.
Kittridge.
You
and
I
know
about
this.
That's
where
it
stops,
-
It
never
happened.
I
want

manning

You
contacting
your
buyer?
Ethan?
KRIEGER:
Ethan.
Ethan.
Oh...
Excuse
me.
Mr
Hunt.
You're
not
going
My
contact
is
extremely
shy.
I
don't
think
you're
in
any
position
Not
while
I'm
holding
this.
Krieger...

You
mean
this?
That's
not
the
list.
What's
the
matter?
Where'd
it
go?
It's
gone.
What?
You.
No.
No?
No,
come
on.
But
not
too
far.
I
know
what
you're
thinking,
You're
thinking,
I
was
up
here,
he
was...
Yes,
and
he
was...
he
was
carrying
two
disks.
So
hard
to
keep
track
Where
is
it?
Do
you
actually
think
Try
any
sleight
of

with

You're

CLAIRE:
I'm
so
sorry.
Krieger
was
my
call.
I'm
sorry,
Ethan.
We
did
what
we
had
to
do.
I'm
going
to
try
and
get
some
sleep.
Krieger
did
have
the
NOC
list?
-
You
hold
on
to
it.
Because
if
you
knew
about
it,
I'm
not
going
to
let
this
Exactly.
That's
your
job
Don't
let
this
NOC
list
What
is
the
range
of
this
thing?
It's
hard
to
tell.

MAN:
What
we
have
here...

Kittridge.
I
see
you've
been
out
It's
Hunt.
What
do
you
You've
been
watching
Hauling
mom
off
to
jail
in

TECHNICIAN:
He's
in
England.
Get
MI5.
Ethan,
I
want
to
assure
you
that
my
first
order
of
business
is
to
have
these
ridiculous
charges
and
eliminated
completely
If
you,
uh,
if
you
come
in
now,
{y:i}we
can
plea
down
Can
I
ask
you
something,
Kittridge?
Certainly,
Ethan.
If
you're
dealing
with
someone
shot,
and
detonated
{y:i}five
members
of
his
own
IMF
team...
how
devastated
do
you
think
he'll
be
by
marching
Ma
and
Uncle
Donald
{y:i}I
don't
know,
Ethan.
Lost
him.
We
needed
three
more
seconds.
He
wanted
us
to
know
You're
a
hard
man
to
catch
up
with.
The
next
day
I
managed
I
must
have
just
missed
you.
Then
you
followed
us
to
the
States.
But
you
left
Smaller
countries
don't
computerise
So
I
watched
Europe.
Once
you
turned
up
You
knew
I
liked
the
rentals
Hey,
I
showed
them
to
you.
I
remember.
Who
do
you
think
A
doctor's
got
to
see
you.
I
can
sit
up
straight.
I
just
can't
Sit
down.
Sit
down.
Ethan...
I
saw
who
shot
me.
I
saw
the
mole.
It
was
Kittridge.
Kittridge.
Kittridge,
Ethan.
Kittridge
is
the
mole.
My
God,
of
course.
You're
right.
He
was
at
the
embassy
that
night.
First,
he
took
out
Jack
He
shot
you
on
the
bridge.

JIM:
Ethan!
He
must
have
had
back-up
to
take
out
How
did
he
do
Hannah?
No.
No.
He
could
have
Why,
Jim?
Why?
When
you
think
about
it,
Ethan,
No
more
secrets
you
keep
Operations
-
you
answer
And
then
one
day
you
wake
up.
The
President
is
running
the
country
The
son
of
a
bitch.
How
dare
he?
Then
you
realise
it's
over.
You're
an
obsolete
piece
of
hardware
You've
got
a
lousy
marriage
Kittridge...
We'll
go
after
the
no-good
We
won't
have
to.
He'll
come
after
us.
What's
going
to
make
him
do
that?
What
he
didn't
get
in
Prague
-
Whoa.
Jesus,
Ethan.
Good
for
you.
Phew.
I'm
meeting
tomorrow
on
the
TGV,
Tight
security.
No
guns.
A
real
plus.
If
I
supposedly
deliver
Max
has
agreed
to
deliver
Job
to
me.
I'll
have
Claire
and
Luther
Stickell
Krieger
will
have
helicopter
Jim?
I
was
in
a
caf
And
there
she
was...
standing
in
the
rain...
alive
and
beautiful,
thinking
I'm
dead
and
gone.
God
knows
what
she's
had
to
do
to
get
the
job
done.
She
can't
know
about
me,
Ethan.
You're
probably
right.
There's
too
much
at
stake.
Once
we
leave
the
safe
house,
Jim,
I'll
call
you
from
Paris.
JIM:
You
got
it.

What
happened?
I
sent
the
message
to
Max.
We're
on
for
tomorrow.
OK.
Come
here.
Sir.
What's
this?
Incoming,
sir,
for
you.
X-ray's
clean,
electronics,
Gene?
How
long
to
the
London
Terminus?
20,
25
minutes.
You've
got
10
minutes.
Move!


Yes?
{y:i}ETHAN:
Give
me
Max.
It's
him.
This
was
not
what
we
discussed.
{y:i}My
apologies,
Max.
{y:i}There's
a
piece
of
black
cloth
{y:i}Tear
it
away,
Dear
boy...
I
hope
this
doesn't
preclude
{y:i}Not
as
long
as
you
tell
me
The
mere
possibility
Baggage
car,
rack
three.
Silver
briefcase,
combination
314.
{y:i}What
about
Job?
Wouldn't
worry
about
him.
When
you
get
the
money,
What's
the
matter?
It's
not
transmitting.
Try
it,
try
it
again!
Damn
it,
I've
got
to
get
this
MAX:
What's
the
problem?
MATHIAS:
Connection
denied.
MAX:
I
can
see
that.
MATHIAS:
I
always
do.
MAX:
Don't
give
me
that.
KITTRIDGE:
This
is
bullshit.
We
don't
need
to.
If
he's
got
that
list,
he's
going

Excuse
me,
sir.
Your
telephone?
PASSENGERS
WITH
MOBILES:
Hello?

PASSENGER:
I
can't
hear
anything.

WAITER:
Is
everything
all
right?
The
battery
is
gone.
It's
working.

He's
in
the
baggage
car.
Ethan,
Kittridge
is
on
the
train.
{y:i}ETHAN:
I'm
right
behind
you.
{y:i}The
money's
in
the
baggage
car.
Barnes?
Ethan's
right
behind
me.
Listen,
Jim...
Is
it
such
a
good
idea
to
kill
him?
Kittridge
is
here.
We
take
the
money...
Ethan
takes
the
blame.
No
one
else
has
seen
you
alive.
No
one
will
believe
him.
Of
course...
I'm
very
sorry
to
hear
Ethan...
JIM:
Yes.
Ethan
Hunt,
darling.
You
knew
about
Jim?
Of
course.
Just
exactly
when
he
knew
Mind
telling
me,
Ethan?
Before
or
after
Before
London.
But
after
you
took
the
Bible
They
stamped
it,
didn't
they?
Ethan...
Why
the
masquerade?
JIM:
Why
take
the
risk?
Well,
Claire...
you've
asked
the
question.
And
you
are
the
answer.
I
knew
about
Jim.
JIM:
But
he
didn't
know
about
you.
In
all
fairness,
Ethan,
Claire
was
never
convinced
But
I
was
supremely
confident,
having
tasted
the
goods.
"Thou
shalt
not
covet
Let's
get
the
money
and
get
out.
Yes,
let's
get
the
money.
Ethan...the
money.
Give
her
the
money.
You've
earned
it.
All
ten
million.
ETHAN:
You
know,
Claire
was
wrong
Oh?
What's
that?
Good
morning,
Mr
Phelps.
I'm
not
the
only
one
You
son
of
a
bitch.
It's
over,
Jim.
Don't...
Don't,
Jim.
"Don't,
Jim"?

Aah!
Damn!
No,
it's
in
the
tunnel!
No,
no,
don't!
It'll
crash
into
us!
Accelerate!
Accelerate!

Green

I

this
is
what

Hey,

Would
you
consider
