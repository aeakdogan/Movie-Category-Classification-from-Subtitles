It's
beautifuI
here.
It
was
our
aunt's.
We
used
to
come
here
as
kids.
The
Order
uses
it
now
as
a
safe
house.
What's
Ieft
of
us.
At
Ieast.
MuggIes
think
these
keep
eviI
away.
I
need
to
taIk
to
the
gobIin.
How
are
you?
AIive.
You
probabIy
don't
remember--
That
I
showed
you
to
your
vauIt
Even
amongst
gobIins
you're
famous.
You
buried
the
eIf.
Yes.
GRIPHOOK:
You
are...
...a
very
unusuaI
wizard.
How
did
you
come
by
this
sword?
It's
compIicated.
Why
did
BeIIatrix
Lestrange
think
it
It's
compIicated.
The
sword
presented
itseIf
to
us
We
didn't
steaI
it.
There
is
a
sword
in
Madam
Lestrange's
...but
it
is
a
fake.
It
was
pIaced
there
this
summer.
-
And
she
never
suspected
it
was
a
fake?
OnIy
a
gobIin
wouId
recognize
Who
is
the
acquaintance?
A
Hogwarts
professor.
Dnape?
He
put
a
fake
sword
in
BeIIatrix's
vauIt?
Why?
There
are
more
than
a
few
curious
things
And
in
Madam
Lestrange's
vauIt
as
weII?
Perhaps.
I
need
to
get
into
Gringotts.
This
is
impossibIe.
AIone.
Yes.
But
with
you.
No.
GRIPHOOK:
I
have
goId.
Lots
of
it.
-
I
have
no
interest
in
goId.
That.
That
is
my
price.
HERMIONE:
Are
you
thinking
HARRY:
Dhe
was
terrified
when
she
Dhe
kept
asking
you
I
bet
you
there's
a
Horcrux
in
there.
Let's
find
it
and
kiII
it.
And
what
happens
when
we
find
it?
How
are
we
supposed
to
destroy
it
I'm
stiII
working
on
that
part.
He's
weak.
Yes?
Mr.
OIIivander.
I
need
to
ask
you
OLLIVANDER:
HARRY:
We

it's
safe
to

WaInut.
Dragon
heartstring.
TweIve

three-quarter

Unyie--
UnyieIding.
This
beIonged
to
BeIIatrix
Lestrange.
Treat
it
carefuIIy.
And
this?
Hawthorn.
And
unicorn
hair.
Ten
inches.
ReasonabIy
pIiant.
This
was
the
wand
of
Draco
MaIfoy.
Was?
Is
it
not
stiII?
WeII.
Perhaps
not.
If
you
won
it
from
him.
I
sense
its
aIIegiance
has
changed.
You
taIk
about
wands
...can
think.
The
wand
chooses
the

Mr.
Potter.
That
much
has
aIways
been
cIear
And
what
do
you

It
is
rumored
there
are

The

...and
the
Resurrection
Dtone
Together.
They
make

Do
you?
Do
you
beIieve
they
exist.
Sir?
I
see
no
reason
to
put
stock
You're
Iying.
You
know
one
exists.
You
toId
him
about
it.
You
toId
him
about
the
EIder
Wand
He
tortured
me.
Besides...
...I
onIy
conveyed
rumors.
There's....
There's
no
teIIing
whether
he
wiII
find
it.
He
has
found
it.
Sir.
We'II
Iet
you

OLLIVANDER:
If
it's
true.
What
you
say.
...I'm
afraid...
...you
reaIIy
don't
stand
a

WeII.
I

I'II

RON:
Positive.
WeII?
How

RON:

No.
He's

I

HARRY:
Let's

I

Identification?
I

Madam

I
don't

to

GRIPHOOK:
They

she's
an
imposter.
They've
been
warned.
Harry?
What
do
we
do.
Harry?
Madam
Lestrange.
And
why
shouId
I
do
that?
It's
the

poIicy.
I'm

you
No.
I
most

do
not

I'm

I

You

HERMIONE:

There's
a

I
can
hear

...the
Horcruxes.
I

I've

And
I

Oh.
That's

I

a
choice?
Oh.
Yes.
We're
in
King's
Cross.
You

If
you
so
desired.
And
where
wouId
it
take
me?

On.

VoIdemort
