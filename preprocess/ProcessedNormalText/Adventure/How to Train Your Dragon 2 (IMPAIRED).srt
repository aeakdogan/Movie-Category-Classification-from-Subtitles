Careful
what
you

Do
something!
We'll
miss
you,

A
kidnapping.
Yay,

You're
gonna
show
us

help

riders

into

Just
kill
me
now.
That
could
be
arranged.
Stormfly,
drop

Huh?

Good
girl!


All
right!
Okay!
I'll
take
you
to
drago!

Hey,

This
is
what
it
is
to
be
a
dragon,
hiccup.
It's
all
well
and
good
to
call
yourself
a
dragon,

can
you
fly?





Oh,
no!
Aah!



Man,
almost!





Incredible.
Well,
not
bad
yourself.
All
this

Where
was
I?
I'm
so
sorry,
hiccup.
Can
we

over?
Will
you

I'll

This

son.
Who
we

We
will
change
the
world
We
will
make
it
a
better,
Yeah,
I
mean,
that
sounds
amazing.

Oh,
this
is
so
great!
Now
you
and
I
can
go
talk
:
There's
no
talking
to
drago.
But
we
have
to...
We
must
protect
our
own.

We
should
be
getting
back.
Hmm?



Okay,
I
got
you
here!
Now
get
this
thing
off
me.
Never
take
a
toy
from
a
dragon.
Don't
you
know
anything?

Why
does
this

What's
down
there?
Large
diameter
bubbles,
massive
lungs,
cold
water

dweller,
class
five

maybe
six.




Meatlug,
what's
wrong,
girl?
Don't
move!
Uh...

eret:

Get
off
me!

Always
great

warm
up
here?

Well,
as
you
can
see,
with
a
new
batch
of
dragons,
just
like
I
promised.
He's
waking
up!
Give
me
some
backup
here!
Watch
out!
Drop
the
ropes.








Snotlout:
Hookfang!
What
are
you
doing?!
You
belong
to
me
now.

Eret:
I
also
caught
you
No
extra
charge.
Are
you
kidding
me?
But
you
were
so
perfect!
Turns
out
there's
a
whole
bunch

How
many?
Drago
doesn't
have
them
How
many?
A
whole
island
full.
I
wouldn't
worry
about
it.
:
My
men
are
They
won't
know
I
promise
you
that.
Oh,
yes,
they
will!
and
they
have

you
so
much
as
touch
us,
Hiccup?
Really,
trust
me.

only
the
son
his
heir
to
the
and
the
greatest
dragon
master
"Dragon
master"?
I
alone
control
the
dragons.
Nope,
mm-mm.
And
unless
you
let
us
go
he
will
blast
through
here
and
blow
your
entire
to
splinters.
Then
they'll
be
crying

Good
one,
babe.
Like
babies,
Real
tiny
ones.
First
there
was
one
rider,

And
you
led
them
to
me!

Stop
all
preparations!
We
must
attack
We
will
take
down
their
Alpha.
Then
we
will
take
berk!

Drago!
And
get
rid
of
him.




Astrid:

No!


Well,
bud...
We
can't
wait
around
for
drago
We've
got
to
find
him
first.




Let's
go.


Easy
now.
Are
you
kidding
me?
The
same
way
we're
"We"?
Toothless,
come.
Okay,
uh,
dad,
you
need
to
know.
Well,
this
isn't
an
"on
the
way"
I've
heard
enough,
hiccup.
More-more
of
development
variety.
Yeah,
just
add
it
to
pile.
Hiccup:
dad,
unlike
most
surprises
this
is
one
you'll
like,

just
have
to

Uh...
You
might
want
to
take
this
one.

Oh,
boy.
Oh,

dad,
could
you
put

I
know
what
How
could
I
have
done
this?

Stayed
away
all
of
these
years,

why
didn't
To
our
son?
Well...
What
sign
did
I
have
that
you
could
change,
stoick?
That
anyone
on
berk
could?
I
pleaded
so
many
times
to
stop
the
fighting,
but
did
any
of
you
listen?
This
is
why
I
never
married.
This,
and
one
other
reason.
I
know
that
I
left
you
to
raise
hiccup
alone,
but
I
thought
he'd
be
and
I
was
wrong.
I
see
that
now,
but...
Oh!
Stop
being
so
stoic,
stoick.
Go
on,
shout,
scream,
say
something!
You're
as
beautiful
