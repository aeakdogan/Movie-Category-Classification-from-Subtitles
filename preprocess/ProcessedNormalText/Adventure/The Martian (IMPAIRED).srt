76

Am
I
reading
that
right?
MINDY:
Are
you
asking
me?
SANDERS:
I
am.
Yes,
sir.
Mark
drove
two
hours
did
a
short
EVA
and
then
We
think
the
EVA
was
to
change
batteries.
He
didn't
load
up
the
oxygenator
or
the
water
reclaimer?
Every
41
hours,
there's
a
17
minute
gap.
It's
just
the
way
the
orbits
work...
so
it's
possible
that
we
missed
something.
I
want
that
gap
down
to
four
minutes.
I'm
giving
you
total
authority
over
satellite
trajectories
Make
it
happen.
Okay.
Let's
assume
Miss
Park
So
Mark's
not
going
to
Ares
4.
Yet.
But
he's
smart
enough
to
figure
out
that's
his
only
chance.
Bruce,
what's
the
earliest
With
the
positions
it'll
take
nine
months.
It'll
take
six
months
to
Three
months.
Three?
SANDERS:
You're
going
and
then
I'm
gonna
make
a
speech...
about
the
blinding
capabilities
of
the
JPL
team...
and
then
you're
going
to
do
the
math
in
your
head
and
say
"The
overtime
alone
will
be
a
nightmare."
The
overtime
alone
SANDERS:
Get
started.
I'll
find
you
the
money.
We
need
to
tell
the
crew.
VINCENT:
Mitch,
we've
discussed
this.
No,
you
discussed
this.
I'm
the
one
who
decides
They
deserve
to
know.
Once
there's
a
real
rescue
Otherwise,
it's
moot.
Bruce
has
three
months
That's
all
that
matters
right
now.
We'll
do
our
best.
Mark
dies
if
you
don't.
WATNEY:
It's
been
48
sols
So
now
it's
time
They
grew
even
better
I
now
have
400
I
dug
them
up,
being
careful
The
smaller
ones
I'll
reseed,
the
larger
ones
are
my
food
supply.
All
natural,
organic,
You
don't
hear
that
And
by
the
way,
none
of
if
I
can't
figure
out
a
way
I
know
what
I'm
gonna
do.
Oh!
He's
moving
again.
Where
the
hell
is
he
going?
He
hasn't
changed
course
for
13
days.
He's
nowhere
near
the
Ares
4.
Unless
he's
not
taking
a
direct
route.
He
might
be
trying
to
avoid
some
obstacle.
What
obstacle?
It's
Acidalia
Planitia.
There's
nothing
out
there
except
the...
What?
I
need
a
map.
Yeah.
Hey,
come
on.
What
are
you
doing?
It's
all
right.
It's
all
right.
Can
I
borrow
this?
Okay,
so
where
is
the
Hab
location?
31.2
degrees
north,
28.5
degrees
west.
Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
-
Where's
Watney?
There.
VINCENT:
Okay.
Okay.
I
know
where
he's
going.
I
need
to
get
on
an
airplane.

Vincent,
how
are
you?
Good
to
see
you.
-
Good
flight?
Yeah.
It's
in
storage
just
around
the
corner.
Hey,
Vincent,
nice
to
see
you
again.
Nice
to
see
you.
What
are
the
chances
Mark
It's
hard
to
say.
We
lost
contact
in
'97.
We
think
it
was
battery
failure.
Though
I'd
like
to
point
out
it
lasted
three
times
longer
Nobody's
criticizing
JPL's
work,
Bruce.
I
just
need
to
speak
to
everybody
that
was
here
in
'97.
They're
already
here.
Guys.
I'd
like
to
introduce
Vincent
Kapoor.
Director
of
Mars
Missions
for
NASA.
This
is
our
current
team...
and
our
original
project
members.
-
Is
this
the
replica?
Okay.
Let's
see
it.
Pathfinder.
Pathfinder.

Come
on.
Come
on.



Holy
shit.
Okay.
"Broadcasting
status.
"Listening
for
telemetry
signal."
Uh-huh.
-
TIM:
Okay.
Signal
acquired.

-
VINCENT:
All
right.
Camera.

Incoming.
"Are
you
receiving
me?"
"Yes.
No."

Okay,
point
the
camera
at
"yes."
32-minute
round-trip
All
he
can
do
is
ask
yes
or
no
questions...
and
all
we
can
do
is
point
the
camera.
This
won't
exactly
be
of
snappy
repartee.
-
Are
you
kidding
me?
-
Just
point
the
camera.
Pointing
the
camera.
Whoo!
Yes!
Yes!
So
here's
the
rub.
Somehow
we
have
to
have
complex
astrophysical
engineering

using
nothing
but
a
from
1996.
Luckily...
the
camera
does
spin.
So
I
can
make
an
alphabet.
It
can't
be
our
alphabet.
26
characters
plus
a
question
card
into
360
gives
us
13
degrees
of
arc.
That's
way
too
narrow.
I'd
never
know
what
the
Ooh.
Hexadecimals.
Hexadecimals
to
the
rescue.
I
figured
one
of
you
guys
kept
an
ASCII
table
lying
around.
And
I
was
right.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
I
give
you
super-nerd
Who
also
had
copies
of
Zork
II...
and
Leather
Goddesses
of

Seriously,
Johanssen...
it's
like
the
Smithsonian
-
Not
that
I'm
complaining.
Who
am
I
to
talk
about
loneliness?
I
know
where
he's
going
with
this.

"F,
O."
"7,
W."

Vincent.
Vincent,
wake
up.

Now
that
we
can
have
more
the
smart
people
at
NASA
on
how
to
hack
the
Rover...
so
that
it
can
talk
to
Pathfinder.
If
I
hack
a
tiny
bit
of
code...
just
20
instructions
in
the
NASA
can
link
the
broadcasting
frequency...
and
we're
in
business.

Yeah?

VINCENT:
Oh,
my
God.

SANDERS:
Yes,
sir.
He
is
under
a
tremendous
amount
of
stress.
I
understand.
We're
working
on
it.
I'm
sure
he
didn't
mean
what
he
said.
Thank
you,
Mr.
President.
MITCH:
Problem
is,
Mark's
right.
The
longer
we
wait,
the
We
need
to
tell
the
crew.
You're
bringing
this
up
while
so
he
can't
argue
the
other
side.
I
shouldn't
have
to
answer
to
Vincent.
Or
anyone
else.
It's
time,
Teddy.

JOHANSSEN:

Lewis?
Go

JOHANSSEN:

You're
in

MARTINEZ:

JOHANSSEN:

I
don't
need

Vogel's

Hey,

does
it
for
you,
man.
There's
a
video
message.
It's
addressed
to
the
whole

LEWIS:
Play
it.
Come
on,
guys.
BECK:
I
wanna
get
in
on

Hi,
hello.
It's
Mitch.
I
have
some
news.
There's
no
subtle
way
to
put
this.
Mark
Watney
is
still
alive.
-
Oh,
my
God.
I
know
that's
a
surprise
and
I
know
you
will
have
a
lot
of
questions.
But
here
are
the
basics.
He's
alive
and
he's
healthy.
We
found
out
two
months
ago
-
Two
months?
MITCH:
I
was
strongly
We're
telling
you
now
because...
we
finally
have
and
a
viable
rescue
plan.
We'll
give
you
a
write-up
a
full
write-up
of
everything.
But
it's
not
your
fault.
Mark
stresses
that
So...
Yeah...
Take
some
time
to
absorb
this.
And
send
all
the
questions
you
want.
We'll
answer
them.
All
right.
Henderson
out.
BECK:
Holy
shit,
he's
alive.
I
left
him
behind.
-
JOHANSSEN:
No.
We
all
left
together.
You
were
following
orders.
I
left
him
behind.
WATNEY:
So
now
that
they
won't
shut
up.
They
want
constant
updates
and
they
got
a
room
full
of
people
trying
to
micromanage
my
crops.
Which
is
awesome.
Look,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
but
I
am
the
greatest
One
big
bonus
to
this
communication
is
the
email.
I'm
Big
data
dumps
like
when
I
even
got
one
from
the
president.
The
coolest
one,
though,
was
from
University
of
Chicago,
my
alma
mater.
They
say
that
once
you
you've
officially
colonized
it.
So,
technically...
I
colonized
Mars.

In
your
face,
Neil
Armstrong.
In
other
news,
there's
been
a
request...
for
me
to
pose
for
a
photograph
on
my
next
transmission.
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
whether
I
should
go
with
"High
School
Senior"...
or
"coquettish
ingenue."
But
I'm
not
really
sure
how
that's
gonna
look
with
my
spacesuit
on.

Hey!
ANNIE:
What
is
he
doing?
I
asked
for
a
photo,
Just
be
grateful
we
got
I
can't
use
this,
I
need
a
picture
of
his
face.
I
could
tell
him
to
but
then
he'd,
you
know,
die,
so...

SANDERS:
We'll
release
the
photo
when
we
detail
the
rescue
operation.
I
want
to
announce
we're
launching
some
supplies
to
him
next
year...
during
the
Hohmann
Transfer
Window.
Bruce,
your
team's
still
on
schedule?
It'll
be
tight,
but
we'll
make
it.
Nine-month
travel
time.
That
puts
the
probe
to
Mars
on
Sol
868.
Did
we
get
the
botany
team's
analysis?
Yeah,
they
estimate
Mark's
They
grudgingly
admit
that
Grudgingly?
Yeah.
Mark
has
a
to
have
sex
with
themselves...
whenever
they
question
SANDERS:
Get
him
in
line,
Vincent.
We
can't
afford
any
miscommunication.
I
hate
this
margin.
912
Sols
worth
of
food.
And
that's
assuming
nothing
goes
wrong.

of

Vincent,
why
wasn't
this
addressed
in
the
inspections
phase?
In
order
to
make
our
launch
window,
we
were
forced
to

SANDERS:
Yes.
Yes,
I
understand.
Thank
you.
Yes!

BRUCE:
All
right.
Thanks
to
my
uncle
Tommy
in
China,
we
get
another
chance
at
this.
Now,
we
finished
the
We
are
now
gonna
attempt

We
can
jettison
any
kind
of

We're
only
sending
rations.
We
can
crash-land
on
Mars.
You
should
hang
up
the
phone.
-
I'm
sorry,
who
are
you?
I
work
in
Astrodynamics,
and
you
should
hang
up
the
phone
right
now.
All
right,
all
right.
I'm
gonna
call
you
back.
I
know
how
to
save
Mark
Watney.
Your
probe
plan
won't
work.
I've
got
a
better
way.
Astrodynamics?
Yeah.
What
the
hell
is
"Project
Elrond"?
VINCENT:
I
had
to
make
something
up.
But
"Elrond"?
Because
it's
a
secret
meeting.
How
do
you
know
that?
Why
does
"Elrond"
mean
"secret
meeting"?
The
Council
of
Elrond.
It's
Lord
of
the
Rings.
It's
the
meeting
where
they
decide
to
destroy
the
One
Ring.
SANDERS:
If
we're
gonna
call
I
would
like
my
code
Okay,
I
hate
every
one
of
you.
What,
Teddy
doesn't
I'm
sorry,
who
are
you?
VINCENT:
This
is
Rich
Tell
them
what
you
just
told
me.
I
can
get
the
Hermes
SANDERS:
How?
Could
you
stand
right
there
for
me,
please?
Thanks.
Right
there.
Great.
And
could
you
stand
Okay,
let's
pretend
that
this
and
you
are...
I'm
sorry,
what's
your
name
again?
Teddy.
I'm
the
Director
of
NASA.
Cool.
Teddy,
you're
Earth.
And
right
now,
the
Hermes
starting
its
month-long
But
instead,
what
I'm
proposing
is...

we
start
accelerating
immediately
to
preserve
velocity
and
gain
even
more.
We
don't
intercept
with
Earth
at
all...
but
we
come
close
enough
to
get
a
gravity
assist
and
adjust
course.
While
we're
doing
that...
we
resupply
with
the
probe...
VINCENT:
The
Taiyang
Shen.
...pick
up
whatever
provisions
we
need...
and
now
we're
accelerating
towards
Mars.

You're
Mars.
Now,
we're
going
too
fast
at
this
point
to
fall
into
orbit...
but
we
can
do
a
flyby.
What
good
is
a
flyby
if
we
can't
get
Watney
Watney
would
intercept
using
the
MAV.
Ow!

And
then
we
just
head
home.

I've
done
the
math.
It
checks
out.
-
SANDERS:
Rich.
Get
out.
All
right.
-
Is
he
right?
SANDERS:
Bruce,
what
do
you
think?
Well,
if
Vincent
says
so.
We
need
to
use
the
Taiyang
Shen?
VINCENT:
Uh-huh.
What
am
I
missing?
Why
is
that
important?
Because
we
can
only
do
one.
Send
Watney
enough
food
to
or
send
Hermes
Both
plans
require
the
Taiyang
Shen,
so
we
have
to
choose.
But
what
about
the
Hermes
crew?
We'd
be
asking
them
to
add
533
extra
days
to
their
mission.
Yeah.
They
wouldn't
Can
the
Hermes
function
for
533
days
beyond
the
scheduled
mission
end?
It
should.
Built
to
last
the
full
so
technically,
it's
only
But
if
something
goes
wrong...
Then
we
lose
the
crew.
BRUCE:
So
what?
We
of
killing
one
person...
or
a
low
chance
of
How
do
we
make
that
decision?
We
don't
have
to
make
it,
Bruce.
He
does.
MITCH:
Yeah,
well,
bullshit.
It
should
be
Commander
Lewis'
call.
We
still
have
a
chance
to
bring
five
astronauts
home
safe
and
sound.
I'm
not
risking
their
lives.
Let
them
make
that
decision.
Mitch,
we're
going
with
option
one.
You
goddamn
coward.
-
VOGEL:
Johanssen?
I
know
it's
your
private
time.
JOHANSSEN:
Yeah,
go
ahead.
VOGEL:
Where
are
you?
The
gym.


What's
up?
I
just
got
an
email
from
my
wife
and
the
subject
line
says,
"Our
children."
My
computer
won't
open
the
attachment.
Okay.
Let's
take
a
look.
Uh...
Let's
see.
This
isn't
a
JPEG.
It's
a
plain
ASCII
text

I
don't
really
know
what
we're
looking
at.
Does
that
make
any
sense
to
you?
"Rich
Purnell
Maneuver."
It's
a
course
maneuver
And
the
mission
concludes
211
days
later.
MARTINEZ:
Would
it
work?
LEWIS:
Mmm-hmm.
We
ran
the
BECK:
It's
a
brilliant
course.
So
why
all
the
cloak
and
dagger?
Because
it
goes
directly
Yeah.
If
we
do
the
maneuver,
they'd
have
to
send
the
We
have
the
opportunity
So,
are
we
gonna
do
it?
If
it
was
up
to
me,
we'd
But
it
is,
though,
isn't
it?
Up
to
you.

Not
this
time.
This
is
something
NASA
expressly
rejected.
We're
talking
about
mutiny
here,
which
is
not
a
word
that
I
take
lightly.
So
we
do
this
together
or
not
at
all.
And
before
you
answer,
If
we
mess
up
the
supply
If
we
mess
up
the
Earth
If
we
do
everything
perfectly...
we
add
533
days
to
our
mission.
533
more
days
before
we
533
days
of
unplanned
space
travel...
where
anything
could
go
wrong.
If
it's
mission
critical,
we
die.
Sign
me
up.
All
right,
cowboy,
slow
down.
You
and
I,
we're
military.
Chances
are,
we
go
home,
Yeah,
there's
that.
LEWIS:
And
for
the
rest
of
you
guys...
I
guarantee
they
will
never

So,
if
we
go

plot

execute

JOHANSSEN:

They
could
take
over

Control.
LEWIS:
Can
you
disable
it?
Hermes
has
four

connected
to
three
We
can't
shut
down
the

because
we'd
lose
telemetry
and

And
we
can't
shut

because
we

to

I'd
have

It's
part

I'd
Okay,
but,
like,
in

I
can
do

Great.
Well,
it
has
to
be

If
we
do

it'll

more
than

yes.

will

and
inform

of
NASA's

to
reroute

Sounds
like
a
smart
move.
Considering
the
circumstances.
Whoever
gave
them
the

Crew
made
the
decision
on

You
may
have

Mitch.
We're
fighting
the
same
war.
Every
time
something
goes
wrong,
the
world
forgets
why
we
fly.
I'm
trying
to
keep
us
airborne.
It's
bigger
than
one
person.
No.
It's
not.
When
this
is
over,
I'll
I
understand.
Bring
our
astronauts
home.
Every
Ares
mission
requires
So
NASA
decided
a
long
time
to
send
some
of
the
stuff
beforehand
rather
than
bring
it
with
us.
So,
as
a
result,
the
is
already
there
at
the
Schiaparelli
Crater,
just
waiting.
So
the
plan
is
for
me
to
just
as
the
Hermes
is
passing...
and
I
guess
they
catch
me?
In
space.
So,
I've
got
200
sols
to
figure
out...
how
to
take
everything
here
the
oxygenator,
the
water
reclaimer,
the
atmospheric
regulator...
bring
that
all
with
me.
And
luckily,
I
have
on
Planet
Earth...
really,
all
of
the
brainpower
helping
me
with
this
endeavor.
And
so
far
they've
come
up
with...
"Hey,
why
don't
you
drill
holes
"on
the
roof
of
your
Rover...
"and
hit
it
as
hard
as
We're
gonna
get
there.

WATNEY:
I've
been
thinking
There's
an
international
treaty
saying
no
country
can
lay
claim...
to
anything
that's
not
on
Earth.
And
by
another
treaty,
if
you're
not
in
any
maritime
law
applies.
So
Mars
is
international
waters.
Now,
NASA
is
an
American
It
owns
the
Hab.
But
the
second
I
walk
outside,
So
here's
the
cool
part.
I'm
about
to
leave
for
where
I'm
gonna
commandeer
Nobody
explicitly
gave
me
and
they
can't
until
So
that
means
I'm
gonna
in
international
waters
Which,
by
definition,
Mark
Watney,
Space
Pirate.
A
Space
Pirate.
Everywhere
I
go,
I'm
the
first.
It's
a
strange
feeling.
Step
outside
the
Rover...
first
guy
to
be
there.
Climb
that
hill,
Four
and
a
half
billion
years...
nobody
here.
And
now,
me.
I'm
the
first
person
to
be

How's
he
doing?

So
far,
so
good.
He's
sticking
to
schedule.
Drives
for
four
hours
before
noon...
lays
the
solar
panels,
waits
13
hours
for
them
to
recharge...
and
sleeps
somewhere
in
How's
he
doing?
He
asked
us
to
call
Well,
technically,
Mars
Yeah,
I
know.
He
explained
it
to
us.
Where
is
he?
-
There.
Here.
Okay.


Okay,
I'm
gonna
start
by
that
you're
not
gonna
like
this.
VINCENT:
Oh,
yeah?
Yeah,
the
problem
is
The
Hermes,
well...
Otherwise,
they'll
never
have
The
MAV,
that
was
only
designed
to
get
to
low
Mars
orbit.
So
in
order
for
Mark
to
escape
and
to
intercept
the
Hermes...
-
He
has
to
be
going
fast.
Which
means
we
need
to
A
lot
lighter.
5,000
You
can
do
that,
right?
There's
some
gimmes
The
design
presumes
500
kilograms
of
Martian
soil
and
samples.
Obviously
we
won't
do
that.
And
there's
just
one
With
suits
and
gear,
that's
another
500?
Ditch
the
life
support,
don't
need
it.
And
we'll
get
Mark
to
wear
Wait
a
second.
If
he's
in
his
EVA
suit,
how
is
he
gonna
operate
the
controls?
Well,
he
won't.
Martinez
will
pilot
the
MAV
We've
never
had
a
manned
ship

But
I
am
excited
about
the
opportunities
that
affords.
If
we
go
remote,
we
can
the
secondary
and
tertiary
comm
systems.
VINCENT:
Wait
a
second.
You
want
a
remote-controlled
He's
not
even
got
to
the
Let's
skip
to
the
bad
stuff!
We
need
to
remove
the
nose
airlock,
the
windows,
and
Hull
Panel
19.
You
want
to
take
the
front
of
the
ship
off?
BRUCE:
Sure.
The
nose
airlock
alone
You
want
to
send
a
man
into
space
without
the
front
of
his
ship?
Well,
no.
We're
gonna
have
him
Look,
the
hull's
mostly
Mars'
atmosphere
is
so
thin,
you
don't
need
a
lot
of
streamlining.
By
the
time
the
ship's
going
fast
enough
for
air
resistance
to
matter...
it'll
be
high
enough
that
You
wanna
send
him
into
space
under
a
tarp.
Yes.
Can
I
go
on?
No.
You
think
he
means
it
like...
"Are
you
kidding
me?"
-
You
know?
Or
like,
"Are
you
kidding
me?"
I
think
it
might
be
the
second
one.
-
Really?
Could
be
the
first
way.
"Are
you
kidding
me?"
Yeah,
it
could
be
the
first
way.
WATNEY:
I
know
what
they're
doing.
I
know
exactly
what
they're
doing.
They
just
keep
repeating...
"Go
faster
than
any
man
in
Like
that's
a
good
thing.
Like
it'll
distract
me
from
Yeah,
I
get
to
go
faster
than
any
man
in
the
history
of
space
travel...
because
you
are
launching
Actually
it's
worse
than
that
because
I
won't
even
be
And
by
the
way,
physicists,
when
describing
things
do
not
use
the
word
"fast."
So
they're
only
doing
that
in
the
hopes
that
I
won't
raise
any
objections...
to
this
lunacy.
Because
I
like
the
way
"fastest
man
in
the
history
I
do
like
the
way
it
sounds.
I
mean,
I
like

Yes,

"did

Yes,
absolutely.
