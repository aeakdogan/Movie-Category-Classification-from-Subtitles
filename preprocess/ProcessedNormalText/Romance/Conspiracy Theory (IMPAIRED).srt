You've
already
asked
me
that.
And
you
have
no

You've
asked
me
that
three
times.
Why
All
right,
here's
a
fresh
one.
Over
here.
Why
you?
Your
colleague,
Mr.
Wilson,
tells
me
That
seems,
um...
oddly
possessive
behavior
to
me.
I'm
sorry,
what
was
the
question?
Why
do
you
insist
on
Why...
you?
I
think
he
has
a
crush
on
me.
How
charming.
He
has
great
taste.
Now,
why
him?
Why
do
you,
uh,
tolerate
About
six
months
ago,
I
was
leaving
Jerry

out

and
He
probably
is
crazy,
but
there's
just...
I
don't
know.
I
guess
I
don't
have
the

I
didn't
know

How'd
you

Please
don't
tell
me
you're
naked.

Please.

What?
Oh,

Think
of

as
her

That's
ironic
because

Yeah.
I'm

No,
I'm

I'm

if

enough?
Well,
um,
maybe.

Yes,
yes...

Sorry.

And,
um,
ask
you
if
in
some
old-fashioned
way.
Everything
you
do
is
magic.
Those
are
song
lyrics,
Jerry.
Yeah,
I
know.
I
know
that.
Uh,
I
know
that.
Look.
I'm
nervous.
I
reached
out
and
grabbed
I
know
they're
song
lyrics.
-
But
I
know
how
I
feel.
I
think
you're
confused.
I'm
not
confused.
I'm
not.
You
wanted
-
How
that
was
possible.
Yes,
we
should.
It's
Geronimo.
That's
love.
And
love
Love
lets
you
see
things
that
I
just
know
that
I've
loved
you...
-
...since
the
first
time
I
saw
you.
You
don't
love
me.
-
Sure
I
do.
-
I
don't?
Uh...
I
thought
that,
uh...
I
just
thought
that
maybe...
ALICE:
Jerry.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry.
I'm
sorry.
Jerry,
I'm
sorry.

-
Hello?

...from
the
Milwaukee
post
office.
JILL:
The
mail

Henry
Finch
is
Where?
JILL:
Foley

I'd
like
to
see

Who?
Is
he
expecting
you?
My

is
Sutton
with
I'd
like
to
see

-
He'll
be
right
with
you.


What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
I'm
very
impressed,
Alice.
How's
Jerry
this
morning?
The
more
important
Those
are
much
bigger
Please
sit
down.
For...
reasons
that
will
soon
be...
regrettably
clear,
I'm
going
Then
you
can
judge
Years
ago...
I
worked
for
the
Central
on
the
MK
ULTRA
program.
It
was
mind
control.
"Manchurian
Candidate"
That's
a
vulgar
generalization.
But
yes,
uh,
you
take
and
turn
him
into
an
assassin.
That
was
our
goal.
Now,
MK
ULTRA
was
But...
not
the...
research.
That,
I
continued.
Shall
I
go
on?
"The
truth
will
set
you
free."
it
involved
hallucinogenic
electroshock
to
induce
terminal
experiments
in
Terminal?
As
in,
"resulting
in
death."
Alice,
I'm,
uh...
I'm
now
trying
to
pay
my
penance.
These
things
that
you're
talking
MK
ULTRA
was
science,
It
all
ended...
the
moment
John
Hinckley
No,
that
wasn't
us.
But
the
technology
had
been
stolen.
Pandora's
box
opened.
My
subjects
were
taken
from
me,
Jerry
was
one
of
them.
One
of
your
subjects.
It
is
imperative
that
I
discover
Alice,
I
will
do
to
stimulate
Jerry
into
Jerry
is
very
dangerous.
Jerry
has
killed.
To
find
who
programmed
Jerry...
I
have
to
find
Jerry,
but
I
Do
you
recognize
this?
ALICE:
Where
did
you
get
that?
JONAS:
You
do
recognize
it,
then?
Of
course
I
do.
It
belonged
to
my
father.
Alice,
what
do
you
know
He
denied
a
man
in
prison
Ezekiel
Walters.
Walters
had
nothing
to
do
When
they
found
him,
The
only
thing
missing
Where
did
you
find
it?
Jerry's
safe
deposit
box.
Alice,
when
do
you
think
Jerry
What
is
it
the
two
of
I
was
mugged
and
he
saved
me.
He
may
have
saved
you,
Alice,
Come
on,
you're
a
lawyer.
Your
father
was
assassinated.
And
the
sick
son
of
a
bitch
has
I
am
so
sorry,
Alice.
I
truly
am.

was
gonna
blow
before
Jonas
