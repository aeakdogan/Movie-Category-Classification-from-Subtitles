There
was
A
boy
A
very
strange
Enchanted
Boy


Weeks
turned
into
months.
And
then
one
I
went
to
my
typewriter,
I
sat
down...
and
I
wrote
our
story.
A
story
about
a
time,
a
story
about
a
place,
a
story
about
the
people.
But
above
all
things,
a
story
about
love.
A
love...
that
will
live...
forever.
The...
end.

You'll
ever
learn
Is
just
to
love
And
be
loved
In
