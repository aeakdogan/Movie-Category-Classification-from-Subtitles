you're

Oh!
-

pretty
Polly.
Your
Majesty
certainly

then,
to
this
thorny
problem.
If
anyone
can
help,
it's
you.
But
it
would
require

Uh,

will

Everything
will

fine.

Here,
Jafar.
Whatever
you
need
will
be
fine.
You
are
most
gracious,
my
liege.
Now,
run
along
and
play
Yes.
That
will
be
pretty
good.

I
can't
take
it
anymore!

I
gotta

yourself,

I'd

I
will

then
I
stuff
the

ha!

Oh,
I'm
sorry,
Rajah.
But
I
can't
stay
here
I'll
miss
you.

Goodbye.

Okay,
Abu.
Go.
Try
this.
Your
taste
buds

-
Get
your
paws
off
that.
Why,
you...
Get
away
from
here,
Goodbye.
-
Nice
going,
Abu.
Breakfast
is
served.
Pretty
lady,
buy
a
pot.
No
finer
pot
in
brass
or
silver.
Sugar
dates.

dates
and

the
lady
like

pretty
necklace
for

pretty
lady.

fish!
We
catch
'em,
you
buy
'em!
Oh,
no.
I
don't
think
so.
-
Oh!
-
Excuse
me.

I'm
really
very
sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh,
you
must
be
hungry.
Here
you
go.
You'd
better
be
able
to
pay
for
that.
Pay?
No
one
steals
from
my
cart.
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
sir.
-
Thief!
If
you
let
me
go
to
the
palace,
Do
you
know
what
No!
No,
please!
Thank
you,
kind
sir.
I've
been
looking
all
over
for
you.
-
What
are
you
doing?
You,
uh,
know
this
girl?
Sadly,
yes.
She
is
my
sister.
She's
a
little
crazy.
She
said
she
knew
the
Sultan.
She
thinks
the
monkey
is
the
Sultan.
O
wise
Sultan,
how
may
I
serve
you?

Tragic,
isn't
it?
But
no
harm
done.
Now,
come
along,
sis.
Oh,
hello,
Doctor.
-
No,
no,
no.
Not
that
one.

Huh?
What?
Come
back
here,
you
little
thieves!

With
all
due
respect,
couldn't
wejust
wait
Save
your
breath,
lago.
Faster.
Yes,
O
mighty
Evil
One.

Part,
sands
of
time.
Reveal
to
me
the
one
Yes!
Yes!
There
he
is.
My
diamond
in
the
rough.
That's
him?
That's
the
clown
Let's
have
the
guards
extend
him
Swell.


Almost
there.
I
want
to
thank
you
Uh,
forget
it.
So,
this
is
your
first
time
Is
it
that
obvious?
Well,
you
do
kind
of
stand
out.
I
mean,
uh,
you
don't
seem
to
know
Hmm.
I'm
a
fast
learner.
Wow.

Hey.
Come
on.
This
way.
Whoa.
Watch
your
head
there.
Be
careful.
Is
this
where
you
live?
Yep.
Just
me
and
Abu.
That
sounds
fabulous.
Well,
it's
not
much,
Wow.
The
palace
looks
Oh,
it's
wonderful.
I
wonder
what
it
would
and
have
servants
and
valets.
Oh,
sure.
People
who
tell
you
It's
better
than
here.
You're
always
scraping
for
food
You're
not
free
to
make
-
Sometimes
you
feel
so...
...
trapped.

What
does
it
matter?
I
ran
away
Really?
How
come?
Why,
you...
My
father's
forcing
me
That's...
that's
awful.
-

Abu!
What?
Abu
says,
uh...
What?
-
Oh,
did
he?
And
does
Abu
Well,
uh,
he
wishes
there
was
Oh,
boy.
Hmm.
Tell
him
that's
very
sweet.
Here
you
are.
-

They're
after
me!
You?
-
Do
you
trust
me?
-
Do
you
trust
me?
Then
jump!
Wejust
keep
running
into
each
other,
Run!
Go!
Get
out
of
here!
Get
this
thing
off
of
me!
-
It's
the
dungeon
for
you,
boy.
Let
him
go.
-
Looky
here,
men.
A
street
mouse.
Unhand
him,
Princess
Jasmine.
-
The
princess?
What
are
you
doing
outside
the
palace?
That's
not
your
concern.
I
would,
Princess,
-
You'll
have
to
take
it
up
with
him.
Jafar?
Oh,
Princess.
Awk!
Jafar,
I'm
stuck.
How
may
I
be
of
service
to
you?
The
guardsjust
took
a
boy
Your
father
has
charged
me
-
The
boy
was
a
criminal.
I
can't
breathe,
Jafar.
Why,
kidnapping
the
princess,
If
you
could
just...
He
didn't
kidnap
me.
Oh,
dear.
Oh,
how
frightfully
upsetting.
What
do
you
mean?
Sadly,
the
boy's
sentence
What
sentence?
-
Death.
-
By
beheading.
I
am
exceedingly
sorry,
Princess.
How
could
you?



So,
how
did
it
go?
I
think
she
took
it...
rather
well.

It's
all
my
fault,
Rajah.
-
I
didn't
even
know
his
name.
She
was
the
princess.
I
can't
believe
it.
I
must
have
sounded

Yoo-hoo!
Aladdin!
Hello!
Abu.
Down
here.

Come
on,
help
me
out
of
these.

Hey,
she
was
in
trouble.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Don't
worry.
I'm
a
street
rat,
remember?
She's
gotta
marry
a
prince.
-
She
deserves
a
prince.
I'm
a
fool.

You're
only
a
fool
Who
are
you?
A
lowly
prisoner,
like
yourself.
But
together,
I'm
listening.
There
is
a
cave,
boy,
filled
with
treasures
Ooh!
Treasure
enough
to
impress
even
Jafar,
can
you
hurry
up?
-

You've
heard
of
the
golden
rule,
Whoever
has
the
gold

Why
would
you
share
all
of
this
I
need
a
young
pair
of
legs
and
Uh,
one
problem.
It's
out
there.
Uh-uh.
Things
aren't
always
So...
do
we
have
a
deal?
Oh,
I
don't
know.

Who
disturbs
my
slumber?
Uh,
it
is
I,
Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch
nothing
but
the
lamp.
Remember,
boy,
and
then
you
shall
Come
on,
Abu.

-
Would
you
look
at
that!
Just
a
handful
of
this
stuff
Abu!

Don't...
touch...
anything.
We
gotta
find
that
lamp.

Huh?
-
Aladdin!

Abu,
what
are
you,
crazy?
A
magic
carpet.
Come
on.
Come
on
out.

Hey,
take
it
easy,
Abu.
Thanks.

Wait
a
minute.
Don't
go.
Maybe
you
can
help
us.
Hey!
Whoa!
You
see,
we're
trying
-
I
think
he
knows
where
it
is.


Wait
here.

Oh!
This
is
it?
This
is
what
we
came
Abu!
No!
-

Infidels!

You
have
touched
Now
you
will
never
again
Whoa!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet,
let's
move.
Abu!
Abu,
this
is
no
time
to
panic.
Start
panicking.

Whoa!



-
Help
me
out.
I
can't
hold
on.
First
give
me
the
lamp.

Yes!
At
last!
-

What
are
you
doing?
Giving
you
your
reward.
Your
eternal
reward.




It's
mine.
It's
all
mine.
I...
where
is
it?
No.
No!
Jasmine?

Oh,
dearest.
What's
wrong?

Jafar
has...
done
something
terrible.
There,
there,
my
dear.
We'll
set
it
right.
Now,
tell
me
everything.
Oh.
Aladdin.
Wake
up.
Aladdin.
Oh!

head.
We're
trapped.

two-faced
son

he
was,

I
pride
myself
on,
Jafar,
I'm
an

I'm
pretty
sure
Your

no.

good-bye

What
am
I
gonna
do?

won't
even
I
should've
known
I
couldn't
pull
off

move.
Hey.
That's
a
good
move.
I
can't

Genie,
grant
me
my
first
wish.
I
wish
to
rule
on
high
as
sultan.
-
Whoa!
What
is
this?
What's
going
on?
Father.

Jafar,

vile
betrayer.
That's
Sultan
Vile
Betrayer

Abooboo.


Genie,
no!
Sorry,
kid.
Jafar,
I
order
you
to
stop.
Ah,
but
there's
a
new
order
now.
My
order.
Finally,
you
will
bow
to
me.
We
will
never
bow
to
you.
Why
am
I
not
surprised?
If
you
won't
bow
before
a
sultan,
then
you
will
cower

second
wish...
I

should
we
say
Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine,
I
tried
to
tell
you.
"So
Ali
turns
out
to
be
"Just
a
con,

I
go
on
"Take
it
from
me

me
adequate
cause

Abu.
Abu!

Oh,
this
is
all
my
fault.
I
should
have
freed
the
genie
-
Are
you
okay?
I'm
sorry,
Abu.
I
made
a
mess
of
everything.
Somehow...
I
gotta
go
back
Carpet.
-

Abu,
start
digging.

That's
it.
Yeah!
All

Now,

What
do
you
say,
my
dear?
Why,
with
you
as
my
queen...
-
Never.
I'll
teach
you
some
respect.

No.
Genie.
I
have
decided
I
wish
for
Princess
Jasmine
to
fall
desperately
Ah,
Master,
there
are
a
few
addendas,
Don't
talk
back
to
me,

You
will
do
what

Jafar.
I
never
realized
how...
Mmm.
That's
better.
Now,
pussycat...
tell
me
more
about
myself.
You're
tall...
dark...
well
dressed...
Al.
Al,
little
buddy.
Shh.
Al,
I
can't
help
you.
I
work
for
Senor
Psychopath
now.
Hey,
I'm
a
street
rat,
remember?
...
cute
little
gaps
Go
on.
And
your
beard...
is
so...
twisted.
-
You've
stolen
my
heart.
-

What
street
rat?
-



Yech!
That
was...
You!
How
many
times
Get

No!
Ah,

Princess.

Jasmine.
Oh,
nice
shot,
Jaf...
Don't
toy
with
me.
Abu!

Things
are
unraveling

Get
the
point?


I'm
just
getting
warmed
up.
Are
you
afraid
to
fight
me
yourself,
A
snake,
am
I?
A
snake,
am
I?
Perhaps
you'd
like
to
see

"Rick

You
stay
out
of
this.
Jafar,
Jafar,
he's
our
man.

Aladdin.

Jasmine,
hang
on.

You
little
fool.
You
thought
you
could
defeat
Squeeze
him,
Jafar.
Without
the
genie,
boy,
The
genie.
The
genie.
The
genie
has
more
power
What?
He
gave
you
your
power.
Al,
what
are
you
doing?
Face
it,
Jafar.
You're
right.
His
power
does
exceed
my
own.
But
not
for
long.
The
boy
is
crazy.
One
too
many
hits
with
the
snake.
Slave,
I
make
my
third
wish.
I
wish
to

All
right,
your
wish
is
my
command.
Yes.
Yes!

The
absolute
power!

What
have
you
done?
The
universe
is
mine
to
command,
Not
so
fast,
Jafar.
-
Huh?
you
got
it.
What?
And
everything
that
goes
with
it.
-
No!
No!

Phenomenal
cosmic
powers...
You're
the
genie.
I
don't
want...
Itty
bitty
living
space.
Al,
you
little
genius,
you.
-
Ahh!

Get
your
blasted
beak

Oh,
shut
up,
you
moron.
Allow
me.

Wonders

Jasmine...
I'm
sorry
I
lied
to
you
I
know
why
you
did.
Well,
I
guess...
this
is
good-bye?
Oh,
that
stupid
law.
I
love
you.

Al,
no
problem.
You've
still
got
one
wish
left.
Just
say
the
word
But,
Genie,
Hey,
it's
only
This
is
love.
Al,
you're
not
gonna
find
another
girl
Believe
me,
I
know.
Jasmine,
I
do
love
you,
but
I
got
to
stop
pretending
I
understand.
Genie,
I
wish
for
your
freedom.
One
bona
fide
-
What?
I'm
free.
I'm
free.
Quick.
Quick.
Say,
"I
want
the
Nile."
Try
that.
-
Uh,
I
wish
for
the
Nile.

Oh,
does
that
feel
good!
Oh!
I'm
free!
I'm
free
at
last!
I'm
hittin'
the
road.
I'm...
Genie,
I'm...
I'm
gonna
miss
you.
Me,
too,
Al.
No
matter
you'll
always
be
a
prince
to
me.
That's
right.
You've
certainly
proven
your
worth
It's
that
law
-
Father?
From
this
day
forth,
the
princess
shall
marry
Him.
I
choose...
I
choose
you,
Aladdin.
Call
me
Al.
Oh,
all
of
ya,
come

here.
Group

Mind
if
I
kiss

monkey?
Ooh,

Well,
I
can't
do
any
more
damage
I'm
outta
here!
Bye-bye,

two
crazy
lovebirds!
Hey,
Rugman,
