You'll

Is

I'll

my

It's

again.
A

comes
out

I
killed
them.
What
did
you
say?
He
killed
them.
Two-Face.
He
slaughtered
that
boy's
parents.
ALFRED:
No,
no.
You
said,
"I
killed
them."

Take
care
of
the

Certainly,

But
your

was

You
are

Throw

I'll

about

What?

I
hope
you

Just
a

But
you
can
call

...The
Riddler.

I'll
call
you
dead,
is
more
like
it!
But
then
if
I
talked,
what
would
keep
you
That's
never
going

Let's
see
if
you
bleed

Harvey!

It's
not

you
want
to

That's
just
too
easy
for
someone
...you.
But
Batman...

...
there's
a

Kill
the

not

Yeah.

Expose

in
your

I
can

you

That

if
you'II...

for
just
a

Thank
you.
I
love
what
you've
done
with

It's
so
dark

Yet

And
yet,
so
you!

This

This

how
I
found
you.
Let
me

This
is
your

This

Does
anyone

feel
I'll
have
more.

There's
more.
But
only
the
first
one's
free.
Here's
the
bargain:
You'll
help
me
steal
production
capital...
...so
I
can
put
a
Box
on
every
TV
in
town...
...and
become
Gotham's
cleverest,
And
in
return...
Is
everybody
paying
attention?

I
will
help
you
solve
The
mother
of
all
riddles:
Who
is...
...Batman?
You
broke
into
our
hideout.
You
violated
the
sanctity
of
our
lair.
We
should
crush
your
bones
into

But
you
pose
an
interesting
proposition.
Therefore,

shoot
me!

Don't
eyeball
me!
Give
me
that!

RIDDLER:
Two-Face,
show
me
how
It's
dead
simple,
my
boy.
...and
assert
yourself.
That
looks
fun.
Let
me
try.

I
have
something
for
you.
I
hope
you
like
it.
Call
it
clinical

I
thought
your
dreams
needed
changing.
My
parents
were
murdered
before
me...
...when
I
was
a
kid.
I
don't...
...remember
a
lot
of
what
happened,
but...
...what
I
do
comes
to
me
in
my
dreams.
There's
a
new
element
now,
though,
It's
a
red
leather
book.
Something
else...
BRUCE:
My
dreams
come
to
me
Bruce,
you're
describing
CHASE:
Images
of
a
forgotten
pain

I'll
be
right
back.
Is
it
possible
there's
an
aspect
You
were
so
young
when
it
happened.
Maybe
I
should
leave
you
two
alone.
BRUCE:
This
goes
way
beyond
taking
CHASE:
All
right.
I
think
he's
fascinating.
Clinically.
Why
does
a
man
do
this?
It's
as
if
he's
cursed
to
pay
a
penance.
What
crime
could
he
have
committed
It's
more
than
just...
...professional
interest,
isn't
it,
Chase?
Bruce,
are
you
jealous?
BRUCE:
No.
I
can't
be
jealous
of
Batman.
I
want
to
be
close,
What
are
you
protecting
me
from?
BRUCE:
Do
you
want
to
know
me?
Do
you
want
to

who
I
am?
I
guess...

two
people.

me.
I'm

I'm

to

you.

If
you

If
Bruce
Wayne
could've
given
his

DICK:
All
I
can
think
about
every
day
He
took
my
whole
life.
When
I
was
out
there
tonight...
...I
imagined
it
was
him
I
was
fighting...
...even
when
I
was
fighting
you...
...and
the
pain
went
away.
Do
you
understand?
BRUCE:
Yes,
I
do.
Good.
You
must
help
me
find
him.
DICK:
When
we
do...
...
I'm
the
one
who
kills
him.
So,
you're
willing
to
take
a
life?
DICK:
As
long
as
it's
Two-Face.
BRUCE:
Then
it
will
happen
this
way:
You
make
the
kill.
But
your
pain
doesn't
die
with
Harvey,
So
you
run
into

and
another...
...
until
one
terrible
morning
...that
revenge
has

you
won't
know
why.
You
can't
understand.
Your
family
wasn't
killed
by
a

Yes,
they
were.
BRUCE:
We're
the
same.
If
we're
the
same,
help
me.
No.
I
can't.

You
still
have
a
choice.

I've

CHASE:

I'm

BRUCE:
The
night
of
my
parents'
wake...
...
the
priest's
words
gave
no
comfort.
Of
course.
There,
on
my
father's
desk...
...
the
red
book.
His
journal.
He'd
written
in
it
every
day.
But
now
he'd
never
write
in
it
again.
At
that
moment
I
knew...
...
my
life
would
never
be
the
same.
I
raced
out
into
the
storm...
...
trying
to
outrun
the
rage.
The
pain.
Then
I
fell.
I
fell
forever.
The
cave
was
monstrous.
It
must
have
been
there
for
centuries.
And
there...
...
deep
in
the
shadows...
...
I
saw...
It
was
coming
toward
me.
I
was
scared
at
first,
but
only
at
first.
The
figure
in
the
dark
was
my
destiny.
It
would
change
my
life
forever.
I
would
use
its
image
to
strike
terror
I
would
ensure
what
happened
to
me
I
would
have
my
revenge.
CHASE:
What
are
you
trying
to
tell
me?
BRUCE:
I'm...
Twick
or
tweet!


Trick.

Remember
the
plan?
Seize
and
capture.
No
killing.
That
goes
double
for
you.

RIDDLER:
If
I
was
a
superhero...
...where
would
I
hide?

Spank
me.
[Chaotic
yelling,
LOUDSPEAKER:
RIDDLER:
Intruder
alert!
Intruder
alert!

Shut
up!
Now,
that's
impressive!


[Fast-paced
instrumental
music,
It's
always
risky
introducing




They
may
have
trouble
adapting






[Electronic
organ
rhythm


Yeah!


Somebody
tell
the
fat
lady...
...she's
on
in
five.





"Joygasm!"




TWO-FACE:
Get
the
girl!

No!
Don't
kill
him.
If
you
kill
him...
...he
won't
learn
nothing.





ALFRED:

Master
Bruce!
How
are
you,
young
man?
You
haven't
called
me
that
for
a
long
time.
Old
habits
die
hard.
Are
you
all
right?
Where's
Chase?
ALFRED:
I'm
afraid
they've
taken
her.
Master
Dick
has
run
away.
The
cave
has
been
destroyed.
ALFRED:
And
there's
another
riddle.


RIDDLER:
I'm
coming,
my
sweet.
RIDDLER:
Like
the
jacket?
It
keeps
me
safe
when
I'm...
...jogging
at
night.
Batman
will
come
for
me.
Batman?

Batman,
you
say?
Coming
for
you?

I'm...
...
counting
on
it.
COMMISSIONER:
What
is
that?
There!
OFFICER:
Who's
doing
that?
COMMISSIONER:
The
Riddler!
BRUCE:
"We're
five
little
items
"You'll
find
us
all
in
a
tennis
court."
BRUCE:
In...
A-E-l-O-U.
Vowels.
Not
entirely
unclever,
sir.
But
what
do
a
clock,
a
match,
...and
vowels
have
in
common?
BRUCE:
Every
riddle
contains
a
number
13,
1,
8...
...
and
5.
ALFRED:
13,
1,
8
and
5.
Meaning?
BRUCE:
Letters
of
the
alphabet?
Of
course,
13
is
M.
BRUCE:
1
would
be
A,
8
would
be
H
ALFRED:
M-A-H-E.
BRUCE:
Perhaps
1
and
8
are
18.
18
is
R.
M-R-E.
How
about...
..."Mr.
E"?
ALFRED:
Mystery?
Enigma.
Mr.
E.
Nygma.
Edward
Nygma.
BRUCE:
Stickley's
suicide
was

ALFRED:
You
really
are
quite
bright,
BRUCE:
Are
all
the
Batsuits
destroyed?
All
except
the
prototype
with
the
sonar
Tonight's
a
good
night.

BATMAN:
What
do
you
suggest?
By
sea...
...
or
by
air?
ROBIN:
Why
not
both?
Who's
your
tailor?
I
took
the
liberty,
sir.
BATMAN:
"R?"
What's
that
stand
for?
Robin.

and
Two-Face

You
could
use
a
hand.
Two
against

are
better
odds.
I
can't

I
won't
kill
Harvey.
"A
man's
got
to
go
his
own
way."
A
friend
taught
me
that.
Not
just
a
friend.
A
partner.


COMMISSIONER:
He's
not
coming.
Shut
it
down.
Wait
a
minute!
Wait
a
minute!


Hey,
go!
Go!
Go!



A-14.


Hit!
Sweet!
TWO-FACE:
B-12.

RIDDLER:
Hit!
My
favorite
vitamin.
TWO-FACE:
Ha,
ha,
ha!


Oh!

That
sinking
feeling.
I
like
this
game.
TWO-FACE:
C-9.



You
sunk
my
battleship!
Who,
me?



This
is
your
captain
speaking.
Please
return
to
your
seats.



I
got
him!
I
hope
they
can
find
the
little
black
box.



Now...
...the
real
game
begins.
ROBIN:
Holy
rusted
metal,
Batman!
ROBIN:
The
ground,
it's
all
metal.
It's
full
of
holes:
holey.

BATMAN:
Wait!
ROBIN:
The
whole
island's
moving!
Looking
for
us?

ROBIN:
That
was
for
my
mother!
My
father!
My
brother!
And
this
is
for
me!



TWO-FACE:
Finally,
justice
is
served!
Let
us
die!
TWO-FACE:
You're
a
man

I'll
see
you
in
hell!

I'd
rather
see
you
in
jail!

TWO-FACE:
Oh,
good
boy.
Good
boy.
The
Bat's
taught
you
well.
TWO-FACE:
Noble.
Stupid...
...but
noble.


Riddle
me
this.
Riddle
me
that.
Who's
afraid
of
the
big
black
bat?
No
more
tricks,
Edward.
Very
well,
then.
Let's
get
real.
Release
Chase.
And
me...
...
and
me!

You've
sucked
Gotham's
brain
waves
and

RIDDLER:
You
betcha!
Soon
my
little
Box
will
be
...feeding
me
credit-card
numbers...
RIDDLER:
bank
codes...
...sexual
fantasies...
...and
little
white
lies.
Into
my
head
they'll
go.
RIDDLER:

Victory
is
inevitable.
For
if
knowledge
is
power...
...then
a
god...
...am...
...
I!

Was
that
over
the
top?
I
can
never
tell.

By
the
way,
I've
seen
your
mind.
Freak!
Yours
is
the
greatest
riddle
of
all!
RIDDLER:
Can
Bruce
Wayne
and
Batman
We'll
find
out
today!
But
first,
let's
meet
our
contestants.
RIDDLER:
Behind
curtain...
...number
one...
RIDDLER:
the
absolutely
fabulous

She
enjoys
hiking,
manicures...
RIDDLER:
and
foolishly
hopes

Ha!
Behind
curtain
number
two...
..."Fatman's"
one
and
only
partner.
RIDDLER:
This
acrobat
turned
orphan...
...likes
Saturday-morning
cartoons
...bare-naked
with
a
girl.
Ha!

And
below
these
contestants...
...my
personal
favorite:
RIDDLER:
A
watery
grave.
Just
one
little
touch...
RIDDLER:
and
five
seconds
later
...gull
feed
on
the
rocks
below.
Ha!
Not
enough
time
to
save
them
both.
Oooh!
Which
one
will
it
be,
Batman?
RIDDLER:
Bruce's
love?
Or
the
Dark
Knight's
junior
partner?

BATMAN:
There
is
no
way
for
me
It's
all
one
giant
death-trap.
Judges?

I'm
sorry.
Your
answer
must
be
But
thank
you
for
playing.
BATMAN:
Wait!
I
have
a
riddle
for
you.
For
me?

Really?
Tell
me.
I
see
without
seeing.
To
me,
darkness
is
as
clear
as
daylight.
What
am
I?
RIDDLER:
Please!
You're
as
blind
as
a
bat!
Exactly.






Bummer!





Thanks.

All
those
heroics
for
nothing.
No
more
riddles,
TWO-FACE:
Just
plain
curtains!

Aren't
you
forgetting
something?
Your
coin.
You're
always
of
two
minds.
Yes,
of
course.
You're
right.
Emotion's
always
the
enemy
You've
always
been
a
good
friend.




Why?
Why
can't
I...
RIDDLER:
kill
you?
Too
many
questions.
Too
many
questions.
Poor
Edward.
I
had
to
save
them
both.
You
see,
I'm
both
Bruce
Wayne
Not
because
I
have
to
be.
Now...
...because
I
choose
to
be.

DR.
BURTON:
...
for
a
consultation,
Dr.
Meridian.
Edward
Nygma...
...has
been
screaming
for
hours
...of
Batman.
CHASE:
Edward?
EDWARD:
Who...
...
is
it?
It's
Dr.
Meridian.
Chase.
Do
you
remember
me?
EDWARD:

How
could
I
forget?
Dr.
Burton
tells
me...
...you
know
who
Batman
is.
EDWARD:
I
can't
tell
you
Edward,
please.
Who
is
Batman?
I'm...
...Batman.

Your
secret
is
safe.
He
is
definitely
a
wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is
that
a
technical
term?
BRUCE:
Listen...
...I
won't
need
this
anymore.
Thank
you
for
giving
me
a
new
dream.
Don't
work
too
late.
