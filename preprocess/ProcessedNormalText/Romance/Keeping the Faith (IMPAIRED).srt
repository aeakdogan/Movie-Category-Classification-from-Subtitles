The
evening
fell
just
like
a
star
You
spit
as
you
slammed
out
the
door
If
this
is
love
we're
crazy
But
I
just
know
there's
got
to
be
more
Please
call
me,
baby
It's
too
cold
to
be
out
We
do
crazy
things
Everyone's
a
bit
insane
I
don't
want
you
catching
Out
walking
in
the
rain
I
admit
that
I
ain't
no
angel
I'm
selfish
and
I'm
cruel
If
I
exorcise
my
devils
When
they
leave
they're
so
hard
to
find
Please
call
me,
baby
It's
too
cold
to
be
out
We
do
crazy
things
Everyone's
a
bit
insane
I
don't
want
you
catching
Out
walking
in
the
rain
-

If
I
was
to
tell
you
that
I
love
you
to
be
with
you,
what
would
you
say?
Goodnight,
Paulie.
Yup.
Yup,
that's
about
par
But
what
I
wanna
see
Between
you
and
me

Let
me
guess.
Your
old
lady
got
fed
up
so
she
took
these
little
ones
It's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
It
always
is.
Everybody
thinks
But
in
my
experience...
-
Holy
shit.
This
I've
got
to
hear.
It's
a
long
story,
-
I
don't
really
feel
like...
Okay,
now
tell
me,
Father,
how
long
It's
been
about
a
minute
Now,
what
about
these
kids?
Okay.
Well,
you
see
the
one
The
cute
one?
That's
me.
-
Very
cute.
Paulie
Chopra.
This
kid
on
the
left
-
He's
a
priest,
too?
C'mon.
A
priest
and
a
rabbi?
I've
heard
all
of
those.
Trust
me,
Okay?
So
there's
this
priest
But
before
they
were
a
priest
they
both
knew
this
girl.
PAULIE:
The
girl.
-
Who's
the
girl?
Reilly?
Let
me
guess,
Not
quite.
Not
quite...
We
all
met
in
6th
grade
at
PS
84,
I
think
I
already
knew
Jake,
Actually,
I
remember
exactly
Well,
it
was
a
defining
moment.
After
that,
Jake
and
I
were
and
a
7th
grade
girl's
attentions
Her
loyalty
to
us
was
constant.
Anna
was
the
friend
That
magical
cross
and
Tatum
O'Neal
in
Foxes.
We
were
some
trio.
Anna
called
us
She
was
gonna
make
T-shirts.
There's
8
million
people
in
New
York,
it
felt
like
we
lived
on
our
own
island.
But
New
York
is
an
island.
I'm
trying
to
sprinkle
a
little
I'm
terribly
sorry.
Continue.
Well,
then
disaster
struck.
The
summer
after
8th
grade,
and
just
like
that,
she
was
gone.
As
for
me
and
Jake,
We
were
like
most
kids
in
New
York,
but
there
was
one
unusual
component:
We
were
fascinated
He
showed
me
and
I
revealed
Just
remember:
What
makes
two
kids
want
to
be
People
don't
talk
much
but
I
knew
it
was
what
Even
then,
people
felt
good
My
parents
had
given
up
so
my
mother
called
me
That
stuck
with
me,
so
at
eight
She
was
so
happy,
she
cried.
My
dad
just
wanted
to
know
Jake's
sense
of
a
calling
Religion
was
more
of
a
hobby
for
him.
Got
it,
got
it,
need
it,
need
it,

Jake
was
one
of
those
special
kids.
Everything
came
easy
to
him.
You
took
one
look
at
him,
and
you
Jake's
family
had
been
in
investment
His
father
and
brother
Ethan
I
think
he
considered
it,
but
he
wanted
to
do
He
made
his
decision
to
become
I
don't
wanna
listen
to
you!
We
went
off
to
seminary
the
way
It
was
an
adventure.
Newly
ordained,
we
were
both
where
we
quickly
confronted


-
Ow!
Oh!
-


Jesus!
Despite
these
setbacks,
Take
it
nice
and
easy.
Shabbat
shalom,
everyone!
I
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor.
I
want
everybody
in
the
back
Guys,
come
on!
Let's
try
again.
-
Shabbat
shalom!
Ma'am,
you
in
the
back,
come
on!
We're
the
Fugees,
no
Lauryn
Hills.
My
mom
was
the
only
person
here
that
I
think
we
can
hit.
Sir,
you're
leaving.
It's
customary
Give
me
something
I
can
work
with!
-
ALL:
Shabbat
shalom!
BRIAN:
I
don
't
want
to
brag,
but
word
and
soon
we
played
to
the
packed

I
know.
I
know!
Seriously,
what
is
the
story
of
Sodom
-
Anyone?
Steve
Posner.
Sexual
perversion.
Steve
Posner's
The
Seven
Deadly
Sins.
Who
can
People!
It
was
a
film
with
Brad
Pitt.
And
Lot
takes
them
in
and
he
protects
Anybody?
Greta
Mussbaum,
-
God
spares
Lot
and
his
family.
You're
going
to
the
Bahamas!
When
you
think
about
it,
He's
always
relied

That's
what
the
story's
about,
God
relies
on
us
The
truth
is,
I
don't
really
learn
about
Those
aren't
questions
about
faith,
It's
important
to
understand
because
faith
is
not
about
Faith
is
a
feeling,
faith
is
a
hunch.
It's
a
hunch
that
there
is
Connecting
us
all
together.
And
that
feeling,
that
hunch,
is
God.
Coming
here
on
Sunday
evening
that
is
an
act
of
faith.
So
all
I
have
to
do
is
look
around
to
know
that
we're
doing
pretty
well
Even
if
all
of
you
failed
Let
us
pray.
Jake
and
I
wanted
Bring
them
up
to
speed,
Jake
said,
"We'll
give
them
an

Feel
the
prana!
We
decided
to
turn
into
a
joint
Catholic-Jewish
A
Fiddler
on
the
Roof
meets
meets
Buena
Vista
Social
Club.
Not
an
easy
idea
to
sell,
We
would
bring
our
religions
We
were
gonna
shove
them
a
little,
Jake
said
we'd
be
like
young
cops
You
know.
The
God
Squad.

Well,
it's
just
like
the
ocean
Well,
that's
the
same
as
the
emotion
You
got
the
kind
of
loving
Give
me
your
heart,
make
it
real
I'll
ring
it.
Nice.
Oh!
Ben
Lewis
comes
into
my
office
-
Rabbi
Lewis?
-
The
end
of
an
era.
That's
exciting.
How
long
until
There
are
a
few
backward
thinkers
Plus,
there's
the
fact
that
I'm
single.
-
Single?
Wait
a
minute.
Are
you
serious?
If
you
don't
find
a
nice
Jewish
girl
soon,
I'm
telling
you,
B'Nai
Ezra
since
the
beginning
of
the
synagogue.
Wow.
I
mean,
you
better
start
It's
embarrassing.
Forget
that.
I
just
want
to
meet
somebody
-
And
it's
impossible
with
me.
-
Because
I'm
a
rabbi!
I
don't
know
if
a
woman
or
because
I'm
Rabbi
Jake,
you
know?
There's
an
expectation,
Jews
want
rabbis
to
be
the
kind
of
And
Catholics
want
priests
-
We
knew
this.
Oh,
no,
man,
check
this
out.
-
Hi,
Shabazz.
Say
your
prayers,
Watch
your
ass,
Shabazz!

Turn
me
loose
Power
to
the
people
y'all
Hey!
Oh!
-
Bye.
See
you
guys.
I've
gotta
quit
playing
the
guys
from
-
Can
I
just
say
oy?
-
What
happened
to
our
youth?
Speaking
of
our
youth,
-
This
is
big.
Guess
who
called
me?
Who
is
the
coolest
woman
-
That's
easy.
Anna
Reilly,
8th
grade.
-
What?
She
called
you?
-
Anna
Reilly
called
you?
Why?
She's
coming
to
New
York
for
work,
Really?
What
is
she
doing
now?
She's
analyzing
synergies
I
couldn't
follow
it,
-
Woman?
-
Wow.
You
told
her
about
us?
She
laughed
for
ten
minutes,
-
Man,
that
is
so
cool!
-
I
wonder
why
she
called
you?
No,
I
mean,
she
called
you.
-
Are
you
in
the
8th
grade
still?
-
I
mean,
we're
both
listed.
-
You're
ridiculous.
-
Let's
toss
this,
we
look
like
idiots.
You
shut
up.
Think
she's
changed?
No,
I
bet
she
still
weighs
88
pounds
For
the
record,
it's
Leif,
long
A.
BRIAN:
Admit
it,
you're
excited.
The
three
of
us
together
again.
-
Is
that
her?

Wow.
-
Hail
Mary...
full
of
something.
Hello,
boys!
-
I
don't
understand.
-
Whoa.
Who
are
you?
Tell
me
everything.
-
Job,
girls,
news...
-
You
start,
catch
us
up.
News:
My
parents
are
happy
-
Men?
-
Come
on,
don't
cheat
us.
I
work
like
100
hours
a
week,
-
Excuse
me,
we
work
pretty
hard
for...
-
That's
a
full-time
thing.
If
he'd
hired
me,
he'd
have
made
-
So
you're
saying
we
won't
see
you?
-
Wow.
I
feel
special.
-
I
got
it.
-
I
got
it!
-
Okay,
thanks.
You
okay?
ANNA:
Remember
the
names
BRIAN:
Remember
Aram
Salaam?
He
said
he
had
diplomatic
immunity.
-
Elan
Portnoy?
-
JAKE:
He
was
always
smoking
pot.
-
ANNA:
Remember
our
shoplifting
club?
You
stuck
that
basketball
under
-
I
pulled
it
off.
It
was
New
York
in
the
'80s,
-
We
should
get
home.
I'm
still
on
West
Coast
time.
So,
this
is
a
rectory.
-
Great
place
to
meet
chicks.
I'll
bet.
So,
what's
your
chick
situation?
Oh,
um...
-
Don't
ask,
it's
not
a
good
story.
His
congregation
wants
to
set
him
up,
-
Why?
What
does
that
mean?
All
these
mothers
make
dates
They're
intimidating.
Oh!
It's
true.
They're
little
women,
You're
being
melodramatic.
Oh,
yeah?
Check
this
out.
I
was
faxed
-
Let
me
see
that.
Ali
Decker.
-
Oh,
she
has
a
skills
section.
You
win.
She
put
jogging
as
a
skill.
She
can't
even
differentiate
-
Maybe
she's
a
skilled
jogger.
-
Why
don't
I
say
no?
I
can't
alienate
them,
Just
relax.
It'll
be
fine.
Oh,
God,
please
let
this
be
painless.
-
Hi!
Right
on
time.
I
like
that
in
a
rabbi.
-
Hey,
this
is
a
great
place.
-
Really
nice.
-
A
lot
of
space.
You
go,
girl!
No
pain,
no
gain!
Oh,
Tuesdays
with
Morrie.
I'm
ready.
-
You
do
these
tapes?
-
No.
-
No.
No
pun
intended.
Feel
my
abs!
-
Not
bad,
right?
-
Punch
me.
-
You
heard
me.
You'll
find,
Rabbi,
I
can
tell.
Call
me
Jake,
all
right?
Okay,
let's
get
a
few
things
One,
I
like
you
a
lot,
and
unless
-
Well,
we
just
met...
No
one
thing
defines
me.
-
Yes.
-
I'm
not
gonna
punch
you.
-
I
can
take
it,
I'm
not
scared.
-
Are
you
a
wuss?
-
Little
wuss,
little
wuss...
-
Are
you
okay?
-
Just
get
my
bag.
-
That
headband's
wonderful.
-
What
is
that?
-
It
looks
really
good.
-
But
it
really
seems
to...
-
No,
that's
all...
No,
no!
Whoa,
that's
okay.
You're
flushing
it
down
the
toilet!
I
had
a
great
time.
-
Goodnight.
-
I
shouldn't...
No,
I
can't.
I'm
telling
you,
you
can.
I
want
you
to.
I...
I
would
love
to,
I
just...
I
got
a...
-
A
friend?
A
dog.
A
male
dog.
-
Pinkus
can
wait.
Just
come
up
for
a
minute.
Whoa,
no,
don't!
No,
listen
to
me,
he
needs
my
help
or
he
goes
-
Well,
send
me
the
cleaning
bill.
Go.
-
You
are
making
me
crazy,
Rabbi!
-
Just
come
up
for
a
minute!
-
I
can't!
-
Are
you
okay?
Good!
Go,
go!
Thanks,
I
had
Are
you
playing
games
with
me,
Phil?
Because
you
know
Okay.
If
those
results
are
correct,
I'll
expect
it
in
writing
Yes,
by
the
end
of
the
day,
Phil.
Phil,
I
don't
have
time
for
this,
okay?

Gotta
go,
Phil.
Gotta
go.
No
way.
Oh,
yeah,
baby.
(CLEARS
THROAT

Okay,
it's
okay.
Take
a
break.
I
suck.
They'll
take
away
my
yarmulke.
-
You
don't
suck.
Okay,
yes,
you
do
suck.
But
that's
okay,
This
isn't
a
talent
contest,
This
happens
in
all
cultures,
God
knows
your
voice
changes,
It's
a
challenge.
God
is
challenging
you.
You
gotta
come
back
at
him!
"you
think
you
can
scare
me
I'm
serious!
You
gotta
show
him
-
How?
-
Say,
"I
love
that
I
suck."
Good!
But
own
it.
-
I
love
that
I
suck!
Good.
You
play.
-
I
love
that
I
suck.
I'll
see
you
next
week.
Hello?
-
Hello?
I
thought
I
got
the
Tony
Robbins
hotline.
-
Sorry,
just
finishing
up.
How
are
you?
That's
funny.
I
had
an
impulse
to
call
You
should
have,
I
was
stuck
here.
-
Really?
Mostly
horrible,
with
a
few
brief
-
But
at
least
it
was
long.
People
should
have
to
qualify
You're
too
precious
-
That's
what
I
tell
them.
-
If
only
you
were
Jewish.
-
So,
what
did
you
wear?
I'm
not
telling
you
what
I
wore.
I
want
an
image
of
a
young
rabbi
-
All
right.
Blue
button-down
shirt.
Blue
pinstripe
suit.
I
can
picture
that.
-
That's
me.
Chic,
with
a
quiet
power.
-
Black.
Kenneth
Cole.
Leather.
-
Big.
-
Wanna
hear
about
my
tie?
-
Don't
give
up
hope.
-
Goodbye,
Mr.
Sharp-Dressed
Man.
Oh,
nice!
I
have
a
friend
here
Will
you
please
turn
Sorry,
Raphae,
hang
on
a
second.
I
have
to
say
this
first
because
Ein
Keloheinu.
It's
a
joyous
song.
It's
a
prayer
about
praising
the
Lord,
telling
the
Lord
But
no
matter
what
I
do,
I
mean,
I
brought
in
the
band.
That
didn't
work.
I
think
we
can
all
agree
So,
this
morning,
Maury,
if
you
would!


-
You
can
even
sing
along.
Come
on!
Have
a
little
fun
with
it!
That's
right.
Get
up!
Get
those
butts
Up
in
the
cheap
seats!
I
can't
hear
you
up
there.
Sing
it
out!
Over
70!
Come
on,
all
the
young
Jews!

-
You
were
wonderful!

This
is
astonishing!
If
my
grandfather
had
seen
this...
This
is
my
daughter
Ruthie.
Rabbi,
you're
so
wonderful.

Jake,
Bonnie
Rose.
-
Hi,
Jake.
We
don't
often
get
celebrities
here.
Once
when
I
was
young,
I've
heard
so
much
about
you.
-
Oh.
-
We're
all
aware
of
your
success.
-
Look,
we
get
on
a
live
feed.
-
I
know
what
you
mean.
Mine,
too.
I'm
at
PMK.
Great!
-
She
just
interviewed
Arafat.
-
In
Arabic.
What
you
don't
know
is
a
lot.
-
Sure.
-
Thursday,
that's
great.
JAKE:
Great.
Nice
to
see
you,
Bonnie.
This
is
the
man
you
told
me
about.
I
appreciate
what
you
did
-
How
upset
are
they?
-
We're
less
than
thrilled.
With
what,
specifically?
With
stand-up
comedy
sermons,
With
people
enjoying
services,
To
be
serenaded
-
At
least
they
were
praying!
-
It's
not
kosher!
What's
kosher?
Study
your
gemara.
Do
you
feel
the
same
way?
It's
not
your
ideas.
You're
just
a
little
aggressive...
-
But,
Ben,
come
on!
It
was
working!
-
You
shake
things
up.
That's
good.
But
appreciate
that
many
people
It's
not
just
the
board.
Mrs.
Katz
likes
to
sing
Tradition
is
not
old
habit.
I'm
not
interested
I
want
to
push
people
to
grow.
I
know,
but
you
have
You'll
find
people
go
a
lot
farther
if
they
feel
they're
being
led

Good
for
you,
Anna.
No
more
of
this
Most
men
are
unworthy
As
a
woman
on
your
own,
what
do
you
do
Don't
you
want
to
share
it?
Do
what
they
do.
Take
lovers.
Mom...
It's
true.
And
when
lovers
bore,
-
I
take
classes.
-
Kabbalah.
You?
I
used
to
take
kick-boxing,
but
it
was
-
It's
doubled
my
energy.
RUTH:
I
know,
I
take
You
take
tae-bo?
RUTH:
Look
at
those
pomegranates.
Our-Lady's
bedstraw.
Now,
over
to
you.
Wow!
Twenty
minutes.
It's
my
right
to
check.
-
Not
the
Shapiro
girl.
-
The
problem
was
here.
-
No,
not
bad
skin.
You
want
an
example?
I
take
her
out
I
get
pecan
pie.
Her
face
swells
up
like
a
chipmunk.
-
So
what?
-
There
must
be
somebody
for
you.
-
He's
got
a
very
hot
prospect.
Rachel
Rose!
-
ABC
Rachel
Rose?
I
could
be
in-laws
Peter
Jennings
would
be
Speaking
of
in-laws,
Ethan
and
Jackie
-
How
is
Ethan?
He's
a
vice-president
now.
How
nice.
I
got
to
hear
this
from
you.
-
Maybe
if
you
called
him...
-
Mom,
he'd
love
to
hear
from
you.
I
got
you,
I'm
proud
of
you.
I've
reconnected
with
this
old
friend.
Let's
just
hold
hands
and
breathe.
-
You're
not
breathing.
-
I
don't
hear
you
breathing.

Blam!
-
All
right,
I
gotta
go.
I
gotta
go!
Why
not
have
that
thing
I'll
be
top
on
the
list.
-
¿
Hola,
María,
cómo
está?
-
Hello,
young
sir!
-
It's
like
I'm
in
The
Godfather.
Gotta
go
through
me
to
get
to
Him.
Whoa,
children.

I
totally
forget
I
know.
Whoever
said
it,
New
Yorkers
understand
must
be,
in
some
sense,
kidding.
-
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
It's
personal,
so...
-
Are
we
gonna
have
the
sex
talk?
-
I
want
to
know
how
this
works
for
you.
-
Really?
Okay.
-
Well,
you
don't,
right?
-
At
all?
So,
have
you
ever...
-
Yes!
-
With
women?
-
So,
you're
not
gay.
-
Sure?
But
even
if
I
was,
-
Do
you
miss
it?
-
Are
you
tempted?
-
You'd
love
it
if
the
rule
changed.
-
Do
you
fantasize?
How
is
that
possible?
Especially
knowing
you're
a
priest.
-
I'm
not
blind,
okay.
It's
not
an
issue
for
me.
It's
really
not.
-
Really?
I'm
completely
committed
to
what
I
do.
To
my
work.
It
defines
me,
And
it
fulfills
me.
I'm
very
happy.
That
particular
sacrifice
is
a
gesture,
-
Quite
a
gesture.
It's
like
giving
up
smoking,
but
then
you
don't
care
I
quit
two
years
ago
I
want
to
French
kiss
them
Well,
don't
be
a
priest!
I
really
admire
your
commitment.
You've
sacrificed
for
what
you
do.
There
comes
a
point
you
know,
like
I
want
You're
amazing.
-
Thanks.
-
Thus
endeth
the
sex
conversation?
I
bet
no
one
ever
asks
Len,
don't
argue
with
me.
I'll
be
back
in
an
hour,
run
it
again.
Rachel
Rose!
When's
that
going
down?
-
Thursday.
-
Are
you
excited?
-
Where
are
you
taking
her?
You
can't
take
her
to
Ernie's!
-
You
cannot
take
Rachel
Rose
there.
-
You
must
go
somewhere
new
and
hot.
-
What's
new
and
hot?
Twenty-nine
years
old,
journalism
Perfect.
Middle
Eastern.
-
What's
a
good
place?
You
need
a
reservation.
-
Will
you
wear
a
suit,
or
go
casual?
-
No,
suit,
definitely
a
suit.
-
Now
you're
making
me
think.
What
if
you
guys
came
with
me?
Bring
a
priest
on
your
date?
Not
a
priest,
my
friend
Brian,
Pretend
you're
a
couple.
Are
you
busy?
-
You
could
bring
your
cell
phone.
-
What's
the
point?
I
don't
need
a
chaperone,
I'm
begging
you.
That's
how
the
business
is
going.
-
That's
why
Brokaw
stands
now.
-
Tom
Brokaw
stands
to
read
the
news.
-
Yeah.
-
He's
done
it
for
about
a
year
now.
I
saw
your
sarin
gas
report.
Thanks.
-
I
got
through
a
bris
without
fainting.
-
A
grateful
nation
thanks
you.
So,
how
long
have
you
two
-
Oh,
right...
We've
all
known
each
other
-
I
had
a
crush
on
Anna.
-
I
told
you
that.
She
knew
that.
Anyway,
we
reconnected
and
we
just
clicked,
very
unexpectedly.
I
think
it's
great
Always.
Friends
first.
So,
do
you
write
your
own
reports?
Yeah.
I
wouldn't
trust
You
write
your
own
sermons,
right?
Actually,
I
download
them
off
the
Net.
-
I
use
www.
Hotgod.com.
-

No.
No,
I
was
kidding.
-
So,
you
do
write
your
own
sermons?
He
writes
beautiful
sermons.
Actually,
I
like
to
improvise.
I
guess
you
can't
do
that
-
What?
No,
not
really.
I
bet
the
Middle
East
is
lovely
Well,
not
if
you're
Kurdish.

Excuse
me.
Oh,
my
God!
The
Iraqi
Defense
Minister
-
Is
that
bad
or
good?
-
Brian,
would
you
explain
it
to
him?
-
How's
it
going?
-
She's
great,
too.
-
You're
doing
great,
we're
impressed.
-
Thank
you.
You
look
beautiful.
-
Thanks,
men.
-
An
absence...
Uh-uh-uh!
-
It's
set
to
vibrate.
-
Wow.
That's
sexy.
No.
You
don't
understand.
We
have
a
chemistry
together.
-
Chemistry's
a
funny
thing.
Are
you
speaking
abstractly,
Abstractly.
Well,
looks
like
I'm
going
to
Baghdad.
-
Two
seconds.
It
was
a
pleasure.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
-
Talk
to
you
soon.
-
I'll
talk
to
you.
-
Call
me
soon.
Bye.
What
are
you
thinking
about,
right
now?
It's
funny.
-
I
was
at
the
Met
yesterday.
I
go
every
week,
a
watercolor
by
Bonnard
This
time
I
looked
at
it,
and
I
was
I
was
just
wondering
Sometimes
we
don't
see
things
in
a
certain
way.
You
know?
Very
true.
Yeah.
What's
going
on
with
Ruth
and
Ethan?
Oh,
uh...
Ethan
married
a
Catholic
girl,
-
That's
why
they're
fighting?
-
Two
years
now.
No
comunicado.
-
Totally.
It's...
-
As
close
as
Ruth
and
Jake.
-
That
explains
a
lot.
You
see
why
tonight
was
not
just
a
date.
Hmm!
I
feel
terrible
about
I
totally
understand.
I'm
just
going
to
be
packing.
Would
you
like
to
come
up
I'd
love
to,
but
I
should
leave
you.
Yeah.
Yeah,
long
flight,
I
know.
But
when
you
get
back,
-
I
would
love
to.
It's
a
date.
-
Bye.
Taxi!
-
Well,
this
is
me.
You
wanna
come
up
for
a
while?
I'd
love
to,
but
I
should
get
home.
Me,
too.
I
gotta
talk
to
the
big
guy.
-
Right.
-
Rain
check,
though.
Goodnight.
-
Goodnight.
-
Hi.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
ANNA:
I
haven't
screamed
that
hard
since
the
US
hockey
team
Incredible.
I
wanted
to
do
that
Really?
Right
away?
I
know!
You
were
this
tough,
I
just
wanted
to
pull
you
into
security
That
would
have
been
impulsive.
Well,
this
is
pretty
impulsive,
for
me.
-
Believe
me.
Yeah,
good.
What
would
people
at
work
think
Could
be
a
scandal.
Oh.
-
Listen.
You
know
what
my
life
is
like.
Yes.
And
I'm
fine,
just
hanging
out,
But
sometimes
I
want
-
Is
that
okay?
ANNA:
Think
we
should
I
think
it
might
be
a
little
weird
for
him.
-
You
don't
think
he'd
understand?
I
think
we
should
just
keep
it
simple.
I'm
for
simple.
I
have
something
simple

Do
you
want
to
know
If
everything
glittering
I
see
in
your
hair?
Somehow
tonight
And
do
you
want
to
find
Something
worth
saving?
I've
been
just
waiting
With
this
heart
Of
mine
You're
still
a
mystery
But
there's
something
so
easy
I
feel
completed
For
this
heart
Of
mine
There's
always
something
so
tragic
About
a
hopeless
romantic
We
have
a
Jake
Schram
here
Okay.
I'll
be
coming
here
a
lot,
you
can
just
say,
"Hey,
Jake,"
-
That
pass
is
good
for
one
hour.
Wednesday
night,
you
have
a
call
All
right.
I'll
make
the
call,
He's
late.
Oh,
my
God.
-
No,
no,
no.
-
No,
we're
not.
No,
no...
Oh,
he's
here!
-
Hey.
Debbie,
this
is
Jake.
Jake,
vice
versa.
-
How
you
doing?
Can
I
just
say...
Good.
Good
for
you.
-
Thank
you.
-
Ah,
Debbie...
Oh!
The
numbers
are
good
for
you,
now?
Good.
Just
run
one
more
scenario
Bye.
-
Hi.
-
I'd
go
with
15%,
at
least.
Look
at
this
place.
It's
ridiculous!

-
Try
again.
Hey.
Can
we
close
your
blinds
and...
What?
-
Remember
that
guy
I
told
you
about?
Mr.
23rd
Floor?
Check
it
out.
-
Nothing
interesting
will
be
going
on...
-
Holy
Majoly!
Does
he
have
music
on
in
there?
-
Okay,
we
should
go
now.
-
Ready?
Let's
go.
-
We'll
be
late.
ANNA:
I
can't
Wednesday
night,
JAKE:
What
class?
ANNA:
I
try
new
things.
JAKE:
Don't
be
embarrassed.
-
Nope.
-
Not
even
close.
-
Feng
shui?
Don't
be
embarrassed
if
it
is.
I
like
the
"mysterioso"
quality.
-
That's
good.
All
right.
I
gotta
pee.

Hold
that
thought.
-
Look
who's
here!
Holy...
How
you
doing?
We're
buying
a
turkey!
Are
you
alone?
No.
I
mean,
I'm
with
an
old
friend.
Why,
when
Emma
Gerber
You
should
call,
-
Though
she's
no
Rachel
Rose.
I've
got
to
call
her,
but
right
now
-
Whoa!
-
We
were
talking
about
Rachel.
-
Did
you
come
together?
-
This
is
why
I
love
New
York.
These
are
my
movie
girls,
-
We're
seeing
the
Garcia
picture.
My
daughter's
been
back
a
week.
She's
disappointed
-
How
you
doing?
Perfect.
This
is
my
buddy,
Anna.
This
is
Larry
Friedman,
ANNA:
I've
heard
so
much
about
you.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
-
Lentzes!
-
They're
from
the
congregation.
-
Reilly.
We,
Anna
and
I
and
Father
Brian,
What
are
you
seeing?
-
Andy
Garcia...
-
I
don't
think
so.
We
should
go.
MAN:
Where
are
the
paper
towels?
There
are
no
paper
towels.
I'm
in
a
crisis
here!
I
need
help!
I
need
someone
who,
they
go
to
a
goddamn
store
How
many
jobs
do
you
hope
to
pull
-
You
okay?
I
need
someone
with
WOMAN:
Why
not
get
somebody
else?
-
Okay,
what?
That
was
a
scary
situation
for
me,
That
is
no
excuse
for
what
just
went
on!
I'm
sorry,
too
bad,
-
Then
I'd
say...
Come
on,
bring
it,
bring
the
pain!
It's
a
good
thing
-
Thank
God.
-
I
wasn't
really
mad,
were
you?
-
You
are
in
such
good
shape.
No,
you
gotta
stretch.
-
Come
on.
Does
that
hurt?
Harder.
Harder!
-
Okay,
that's
enough.




ANNA:
Only
three
people
so
if
you're
not
one
of
them,
BRIAN:
Hey,
it's
me.
Are
you
there?

Probably
still
at
work.
It's
not
that
Maybe
we
can
do
dinner
this
week,
This
is
Brian,
by
the
way.
You
know
where
to
find
me.
-
Gotta
go
now.
-
Twenty
minutes?
I'm
late.
-
Fourteen
and
a
half
minutes.
Please.
-
We
all
have
to.
I
do.
We're
doing
a
hostile
takeover
-
Okay.
You
do
that.
-
I'm
officially
going
now.
Toll
booth.
Ding
dong.
-
Time
to
pay
the
toll.
There.
I
paid.
God
was
showing
off
Okay,
go.
You'll
be
back.
They
all
come
back.


Ah,
yes,
they
all
come
back...
Sooner
or
later,
they
all...
Hey.
-
Hi,
how
are
you?
What's
up,
my
man?
-
Why
are
you
here?
-
Am
I
interrupting?
-
Let's
go.
-
Yes.
-
No,
the
place
closes
in
20
minutes.
Hey,
ADD
boy,
right
here.
But
be
with
me
when
we
get
it.
-
Stay
focused,
okay?
Test,
test.
Sibilance...
I'm
the
king
of
rock.
The
guy's
in
the
back,
I
can't
find
him.
The
contractor
wants
to
come
-
Tuesday...
-
I
didn't
understand,
I
just
said
okay.
What
about
Thursday
night?
I
can't
do
that,
I
got
a
thing.
Can
you
cancel?
We're
behind
It's
just
that
Anna
wants
me
-
I
don't
know
what
it
is.
No,
it's
just
that
-
No,
she
didn't
mention
it
to
me.

He's
a
friend
and
he's
always
But
lately
something's
changed
It's
just
he's
got
himself
a
girl
And
she's
watching
him
And
she's
loving
him
with
her
body
You
know
that
I
was
Jessie's
girl...


-
Don.
Rhyme
with
flan.
-
You
have
any
question?
-
Is
this
a
good
machine?
Just
doing
comedy
with
you.
That
one
is
okay,
but
if
you
-
We
are.
The
Audio
2000.
This
baby
got
the
16-bit
dual
Digital
key
controller,
so
you
can
I
don't
need
that.
That's
nice.
How
much?
-
Price
is
not
important.
Okay,
you
got
me,
take
me
away!
But
let
me
tell
you,
it's
worth
it.
When
you
sing
to
your
girlfriend,
and
her
heart...
Boom!
then
you
say,
"Thank
you,
Don!"
Okay.
How
much
does
it
cost
exactly?

I
don't
usually
do
this,
and
I
got
a
piece
of
ass
last
night
Oh!
I'll
let
you
have
it
for
1,
300.
-
1,
300?
-
Excuse
me,
I
feel
a
little
warm.
Oh,
man!
What
is
that?
-
Get
out
of
here!
Is
that
real?
ANNA:
They'll
love
you.
They're
fascinated
by
those
who
JAKE:
All
right,
I
feel
ready.
Give
me
some
business
terms
-
A
BSC
deal.
Booze,
schmooze
and
cruise,
dude.
-
Incredible.
-
Let
me
see...
No,
you're
perfect.
-
Ready,
Rabbi?

Anna,
have
a
shot.
You
think
you
can
talk?
-
Oh,
Len.

Thank
you.
That's
his
problem,
he
can't
drive.
If
the
guy
just
went
down
the
middle,
Excuse
me,
Rabbi...
We
need
help
Excuse
me.
Very
good!
"Talmudic."
Look
at
the
city!
-
You
think
Len
was
a
Ritalin
child?
-
They
love
you.
No,
they
really
respect
you.
-
Actually,
they
want
me
to.
They
asked
me
to
run
the
high-tech
Anna!
Are
you
serious?
That's...
I
knew
it
was
coming.
Listen
to
you!
That's
incredible!
If
you
think
I
had
no
life
before...
But
this
is
everything
I'm
so
proud
of
you,
Well,
here's
the
thing,
Jake.
I've
been
thinking
about
it,
and...
I'm
excited,
but
not
as
excited
And
so
I
don't
think
I
wanna
go,
because
I
wanna
be
near
you,
What
do
you
think?
Wow!
That's...
unexpected.
-
It
is?
Are
you
sure
that's
the
best
thing?
For
you?
Oh.
I
don't
know.
I
thought
you'd
be
excited.
No...
No,
I
am.
I'm
just...
I'm
sorry,
I
thought...
No,
you're
not.
It
was
just
an
impulse.
-
I
thought
that
we...
Shall
we
go
somewhere
No,
no,
no.
No,
it's
so
fine.
I'm
having
No,
I
don't...
Oh...
Whoo!
Let's
go
dance!

I
never
had
no
problems,
yeah
Burning
down
the
one-night
stands
And
everything
around
me...

-
Amen.
-
Oh,
my!
I
can't
laugh,
I'm
so
full.
How'd
you
stay
so
skinny
He
was
blessed
with
my
genes.
When
he
was
a
kid,
he
was
a
little
chub!
He
missed
school
once
-
You're
joking.
Mom,
he
never
called
in
fat,
come
on.
Give
the
guy
a
break,
he
looks
great.
He's
working
out
with
a
trainer,
He
looks
trim
because
she
can't
cook.
She's
a
good
cook.
I
don't
wanna
talk
about
this
anymore.
I'm
sorry.
Sorry.
What
were
we
talking
about?
The
meal
was
so
good.
Thank
you.
-
As
always.
Now
you
guys
get
the
dishes,
Jake,
put
on
some
water
for
tea.
ANNA:
It's
like
a
fairy
tale.
-
That's
called
a
huppah.
Oh,
my
God.
Please.
We
were
so
young.
I
give
Jake
grief,
It
takes
at
least
ten
years
to
know
It's
hard
enough
without
What's
scary
is
spending
ten
years
you
get
those
things,
then
suspect
and,
in
regard
to
the
important
things,
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
Is
my
son
a
good
kisser?
-
You're
in
a
good
mood.
But
you're
in
a
particularly
Okay.
Yes,
I
am.
Okay.
Do
you
want
to
share
anything?
-
Not
quite
yet.
Maybe
soon.
Okay.
-
Well,
you
let
me
know.
I'll
be
looking
out
for
that.
That's
what
she
said...
-
I'm
so
sorry.
-
Nothing.
I
didn't
go
into
explicit
detail.
I
can't
believe
you
did
that.
Jake,
she
figured
it
out
on
her
own.
-
Did
you
try
to
deny
it?
No
wonder
she
was
crying!
I
was
crying,
too,
all
right?
She
was
upset,
but
not
angry.
-
She
put
on
that
face.
I
know,
okay?
All
right?
I
mean...
You
have
no
idea
of
the
nightmare
This
is
not
a
nightmare,
okay?
Stop
it.
Hey,
look
at
me.
Look
at
me.
-
I
am
in
love
with
you,
Jake.
No.
You
are
in
love
with
me,
-
Yes,
I
am.
Because
I'm
overwhelmed
by
feelings
-
Great,
how
do
I
work
it
out?
Let's
take
it
from
the
top.
It's
not
about
Just
you.
What
do
you
need
Those
things
are
me,
understand?
It's
hard
to
accept,
but
the
fact
I
don't
think
so.
Okay,
all
I'm
saying
is
that
I
think
if
it
was
just
up
to
you,
but
it's
a
problem
because
you
think
-
No,
they
can't.
What
does
the
21
st
century
have
to
-
I
thought
we
were
just
having
fun.
I'm
having
fun,
too.
This
is
a
lot
of
fun!
Exactly.
So,
why
throw
it
away?
Can't
you
see
that
you're
asking
me
just
to
see
if
we
work?
I
mean,
I
love
you,
but...
We're
different
in
so
many
ways
What
are
you
saying?
We
have
totally
different
priorities.
I
don't
think
there's
room
in
your
life
That
is
so
unfair.
Your
faith
is
a
huge
part
But
you
must
be
patient.
It
doesn't
You
will
never
find
the
kind
and
you
will
never
be
the
kind
until
you
learn
to
put
faith
I'm
not
saying
we
should
marry,
is
that
I'm
in
love
with
you,
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
How
about,
"I've
always
wanted
I'm
sorry...
You
will
be
when
you
realize
I've
gone
This
is
my
apartment.
You
get
out.

-
It's
for
you.
Who
calls
at
this
hour?
I
was
dreaming
-
Hello?
What's
wrong?
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Don't
move.
I'll
be
right
over.


-
Are
you
okay?
-
I
came
running
right
over.
No,
it's
fine,
don't
worry.
What's
wrong?
-
Everything.
-
Me!
-
I
am
a
loser!
-
I'm
a
workaholic.

Okay,
yes,
you
are.
But
you're
our
-
Brian...
You're
my
friend,
and
if
I
ask
you
Of
course,
you
know
I
will.
When
you
look
at
me,
do
you
think,
"There's
a
girl
No,
and
certainly
not
in
that
voice.
-
Have
I
got
no
spirit?
I
know
I'm
fun
to
hang
out
with,
but
does
my
life
seem
shallow
to
you?
-
Am
I
spiritually
empty?
You've
got
more
spirit
in
you
You're
a
natural,
you
radiate.
Trust
me.
What's
going
on
here?
I
don't
even
know
where
to
begin,
Brian.
You're
my
best
friend,
All
these
feelings...
Now
something
has
happened,
-
It's
okay.
There
are
things
I
have
to
say,
-
I
have
things
to
say,
too.
No,
please,
just
listen...
-
I
love
you,
too.
I
love
you,
that's
what
you
want
to
say,
-
Brian...
We
can't
fight
it,
No,
Brian,
I
can't!
It's
the
vows,
isn't
it?
It's
the
vows,
they
make
I
shouldn't
have
had
I
knew
it.
In
my
head,
You
don't
understand.
Right
now,
for
the
first
time
ever,
I
envy
him.
This
would
be
so
easy
-
Let
me
talk
to
you!
If
I
was
a
rabbi,
-
Listen
to
me!
I
am
in
love
with
a
rabbi.
-
Sorry?

Yeah.
That's
what
I
was
trying
to
tell
you.
I'm
stunned.
Excuse
me,
my
mouth
just
went
all
dry.
I
can't
believe
this.
-
We've
been
together
since
July.

Oh!
July?
We
should
have
told
you,
I'm
glad
you
saved
it,
because
Brian...
Let's
talk
about
this.
You
don't
drink.
In
light
of
recent
revelations,
to
say
what
the
other
one
does
Oh,
God!
You
must
think
I'm
such
an
idiot.
-
No,
Brian.
I
mean,
all
these
moments
with
you
it's
just
been
the
reflected
glow
That's
not
true.
I'm
so
embarrassed.
God,
talk
about
a
bad
case
-
Brian!
-
Melrose
Priest!
I
don't
get
this.
Why
now?
After
months
of
lying,
why
call
me
He
broke
up
with
you,
didn't
he?
That
moron
broke
up
with
you,
-
I...
Tonight,
I
really
didn't
want
to
be
one.
Oh,
Brian...



(RECITING
HEBREW
BADLY
Yes,
I
heard
about
that.
My
grandfather
and
father
were
mohels.
Excuse
me,
I'd
like
to
make
a
toast...
BRIAN:
Rabbi
Jacob
Schram!
Rabbi
Jacob
Schram!
Oh,
Rabbi
Jacob...
Oh...
Hello!
-
May
I
help
you?
I'm
looking
for
my
old
friend,
-
Brian,
what's
going
on?
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
I'm
on
to
you,
and
I'm
in
no
mood...
-
You're
drunk.
I'm
not
drunk,
I'm
Irish.
What's
going
on?
-
It's
okay.
-
And
he
stole
my
girlfriend,
on
top
of
it.
-
Did
they
change
the
rules?
Give
me
that!
I
can't
believe
you!
Don't
lie
here,
this
is
the
big
room.
God
doesn't
look
favorably
on
it.
-
How
did
you
find
out?
-
She
told
you.
What
did
you
expect?
Did
you
think
she'd
just
take
it
-
Hey,
wait
a
minute!
Anna
is
very
special,
You
said
some
things
You
can't
just
write
her
off
Brian,
I'm
in
love
with
her!
Okay?
I'm
sorry
you
found
out
like
this,
that
it's
between
me
and
her.
It
was
between
you
and
her,
Why
is
it
between
you
and
me?
-
Because
I
love
her.
No...
I'm
in
love
with
her.
-
What?
-
You're
in
love
with
her?
It's
very
strange.
I
mean,
she's
like
your
sister,
Brian...
Yes,
thank
you
for
adding
Damn
it,
Jake.
You
have
a
whole
city
Why
go
for
the
first
woman
Wait!
Listen
to
what
you're
saying.
You're
saying
I
should
have
that
a
Catholic
priest
had
a
crush
BRIAN:
So
what?
You
know
how
much
You
could
have
known
I
know?
What
does
that
mean?
Your
casual
relationships
because
they
always
fall
for
you,
-
Don't
put
this
all
on
me.
-
Why'd
you
pull
her
into
your
bed?
I
don't
believe
that.
It's
the
truth.
She's
a
woman,
Ow!
Let
me
get
this
straight.
I'm
talking
to
a
priest
who
went
on
a
bender
because
Right.
Thank
you.
I
want
to
thank
you
-
Why?
You
have
to
give
me
advice.
Oh,
God,
what
do
I
know?
I'm
a
half
Punjabi
Sikh,
my
sister's
married
and
our
grandmother
was
an
Irish
nun
which
is
a
very
long
story.
You're
a
Sikh
Catholic
Muslim
Yes.
Yes,
it
gets
very
complicated.
-
I'm
reading
Dianetics.
Thank
you
for
listening
to
me.
-
I
feel
like
I
should
ask
for
penance.
I
do
shots.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
know.
May
those
who
love
us,
love
us.
And
those
who
don't
love
us,
may
God
turn
their
hearts.
If
He
cannot
turn
their
hearts,
so
that
we
may
know
them
-
Slainte.

I'll
tell
you
why
I
don't
want
I
got
a
joke
A
silent
kid
is
looking
down
the
barrel
To
make
the
noise
that
I
kept
so
quiet
Kept
it
from
you,
pitseleh
MAN:
Anna?
Anna?
I'm
not
what's
missing
I
could
never
be
the
puzzle
pieces
They
say
that
God
makes
problems
Before
you
do
as
the
devil
pleases
Give
up
the
thing
you
love

ANNA:
Hey,
Brian.
It's
me
again.
Please
call
me,
okay,
Finn?
Seriously,
I
really
want
I
remember
I
fell
in
love

She
was
beautiful,
like
Carole
Lombard.
She
grabbed
me
in
the
alley
she
pressed
me
against
the
wall,
I
felt
like
Richard
Chamberlain
in
the
barn
with
Meggie.
I
was
so
happy,
I
could
die.
Did
anything
happen
between
you?
Not
really.
Flirtations,
little
moments.
Soon
after,
the
Russians
invaded
I'll
tell
you
something.
If
she
had
kissed
me
back,
I
would
have
given
it
all
up.
I
mean,
she
didn't,
but...
I
keep
thinking
about
about
how
the
life
of
a
priest
is
hard,
and
if
you
think
you'd
be
happy
That
was
my
recruitment
pitch,
because
it
makes
you
feel
like
a
Marine.
The
truth
is,
you
can't
tell
yourself
If
you
are
a
priest,
or
marry
a
woman,
You
cannot
make
a
real
commitment
unless
you
accept
that
it
is
a
choice,
which
you
keep
making
I've
been
a
priest
over
40
years,
and
You
won't
tell
me
No.
God
will
give
you
your
answer.

-
Hey.
How
are
you
doing?
What's
up?
-
You're
probably
still
mad
at
me...
Did
you
think
you'd
stroll
over
No,
I
knew
you'd
still
be
mad
at
me.
What
do
you
expect?
I'd
have
been
jealous
but
at
least
we'd
still
be
friends.
We're
still
friends,
I
hope!
Friends
don't
lie
to
each
other
That's
why
I'm
here,
I
wanted
I
want
to
talk,
Talk,
vent,
come
on!
Go
ahead,
vent!
Okay...
Now
I
lost
my
momentum.
I
wanted
to
say
that
I
handled
You're
my
best
friend.
-
That
was
very
simple
and
direct.
You're
lucky
I
am
a
priest.
You're
a
good
priest.
I
got
something
for
you.
I
almost
didn't
because
I
was
That's
the
Rabbi
-
It's
the
last
of
the
series!
-
It's
in
such
good
condition.
Brian!
Thank
you.
You're
welcome.
As
pissed
off
as
I
was,
the
weird
thing
is
I'm
very
sorry
I
didn't
get
That
would
have
made
me
happy,
-
Have
you
talked
to
her?
Things
are
really
strange
Are
you
guys
working
this
out?
No,
no.
But
that's
offset
by
the
fact
Are
you
serious?
What
a
mess.
I'm
sorry.
I
was
starting
to
think
JAKE:
Yeah.
Me,
too.
BRIAN:
What
happened?
Hi.
I
don't
think
I'm
the
person
on
this
particular
confession.
Brian!
Brian.
You
don't
have
to
say
anything.
I'll
just
say
one
thing,
You're
my
friend,
I
don't
want
you
to
think
my
feelings
That's
not
the
problem,
and
you
know
it.
I
thought
you
wanted
me
and
that
affected
me.
Maybe
that's
not
fair
and
but
it
sure
felt
that
way
to
me.

I
don't
know
what
to
say.
I've
just
been
having
I've
had
all
of
these
feelings
lately,
and
not
just
my
feelings
for
Jake,
Reconnecting
with
part
of
myself
that
If
I
indulged
those
feelings
with
you,
or
if
I
took
you
for
granted,
I
can't
bear
that
I
hurt
you.
It's
not
your
fault.
I'll
tell
you
something,
I
don't
know
which
feels
worse,
or
doubting
myself,
Don't
you
dare
doubt
yourself.
If
you
start
doubting
that
because
of
me,
I
don't
doubt
myself
because
of
you.
I
feel
at
my
best
when
I'm
around
you,
I
don't
know
what
to
do,
Brian.
Is
it
me,
or
is
confession
getting
Thank
you.
The
lights
work,
the
cameras
came
I
sent
the
invitations
Oh!
No.
We
need
the
disks
-
I'll
call
Don
at
home.
-
Excuse
me,
what
is
that?
-
Since
when?
She
put
God
on
speed
dial.
I
called
it,
Sorry,
I
have
to
say
this.
-
Yeah,
yeah.
-
You
guys
have
been
talking?
-
It's
okay.
-
Good.
I
don't!
Am
I
asking
you
-
I'd
talk
about
it
if
I
wanted
to.
-
It's
just
that
she's
leaving...

Rabbi
Schram.
What?
-
I'm
looking
for
Ruth
Schram.
-
What
happened?
-
A
what?
What
does
that
mean?
-
A
blockage
of
blood...
Bring
me
my
Obsession
perfume,
and
my
computer,
I
gotta
e-mail.
Mom,
the
doctor
said
Get
out
of
here!
If
I
have
to
stay
here
for
two
days,
I
assume
your
brother
Yeah,
he's
stuck
in
the
Hamptons,
Yeah.
Okay,
doesn't
matter,
Thanks
for
being
so
dutiful.
It's
our
pleasure.
Where's
the
third
musketeer?
-
What?
-
I'll
get
it.
-
What
happened?
-
It's
fine,
I've
dealt
with
it.
I
dealt
with
it.
It's
over,
and
I
don't...
-
I
wanna
talk
about
this.
-
I
wanna
talk!
-
There's
nothing
to
talk
about.
Sit
back,
relax.
Listen
to
me.
There's
a
reason
your
brother
isn't
here.
I
know.
And
I'm
not
going
to
let
You
don't
know!
I
made
a
mistake.
It's
true,
he's
punishing
me
a
little
It's
hard
to
see
your
son
as
a
man.
I
couldn't
do
that
for
him.
You're
a
man,
Jake,
a
good
man.
Make
your
own
decisions
I'm
proud
of
you,
no
matter
what.
Mom...
I
love
you.
Thank
you.


Rabbi.
-
How's
your
mother,
Jake?
That's
wonderful.
I
suppose
you
-
Yeah.
And
you'll
go
out
with
a
bang,
huh?


Shalom.
Since
Yom
Kippur
is
the
Super
Bowl
most
rabbis
try
to
cram
into
one
big,
best-of
sermon.
I'm
not
going
to
do
that
tonight.
I
won't
talk
about
the
meaning
of
God
or
the
situation
in
Israel
I'd
like
to
talk
about
I'd
like
to
talk
about
us,
A
wise
man
once
told
me
he
can
only
offer
himself
We
live
in
a
really
complex
world.
A
world
where
boundaries
and
in
ways
that
challenge
us,
not
just
For
a
while
now,
you've
let
me
You've
shared
your
lives
with
me,
you've
explored
your
faith
with
me
in
ways
that,
I
know,
sometimes
have
But
you
put
your
trust
in
me.
And,
over
the
past
few
months,
I
have
been
violating
that
trust.
I've
been
violating
it
For
a
number
of
months,
I've
been
It
doesn't
matter
if
I'm
still
with
her,
What
matters
is
that
I
shouldn't
have
I'm
not
sorry
for
loving
her.
I
am
sorry,
I'm
very
sorry,
Yom
Kippur
is
the
day
of
atonement,
and
so
tonight,
I
stand
before
you
This
could
take
a
while.
Go
home.
Or
you
could
stick
around.
Okay?
Come
on.
Come
on!
-
Yes?
Yes!
Don't
mess
with
me
like
that!
This
is
so
fantastic.
How
does
it
feel?
It
feels
good.
We've
got
a
lot
to
celebrate
tonight,
-
It's
definitely
Manischewitz
time.
-
Did
you
get
the
disks
from
Don?
Not
to
rain
on
your
parade,
I
know
you
don't
want
There
what
is?
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
Jews
don't
do
that.
We
plant
trees.
Who's
talking
about
feeling
guilty?
You're
on
such
a
roll
right
now.
-
You
love
her,
don't
you?
-
Sometimes
that's
not
enough.
Not
enough?
There's
nothing
else
For
years
you've
talked
about
how
and
when
it
comes,
you
walk
away
What
kind
of
plan
is
that?
Think
He'll
give
you
this
a
second
Seriously,
look
at
me.
As
your
friend,
I'm
telling
you,
It's
very
simple.
You
love
each
other,
You
need
to
ask
yourself,
Why
are
you
standing
here?
-
You're
right!
Why
am
I
standing
here?
This
is
New
York
City!
Cross
the
damn
street!
Do
we
need
signs
to
tell
us
-
I
gotta
go!
-
Brian,
thank
you!
Go!
Go
forth
and
prosper!
-
Sir,
may
I
help
you?


I'm
sorry,
there's
no
answer.
T-Bone,
look
at
me.
-
What
is
this
in
reference
to?
Do
me
a
favor.
Go
and
tell
anybody
-
I
can't
do
that,
sir.
Come
on,
just
two
guys,
T.
-
Take
me
with
you.
What's
that?
You're
going
to
San
Francisco
Don't
tell
anybody,
but
I
need
-
Really?
So,
what
are
you
packing
there,
-
320.
Whoa!
Okay,
okay...
All
right!
Next
time,
sir,
I
suggest
Ow!
No,
seriously,
a
toast.
To
Anna.
-
To
Anna.
-
Thank
you.
I'll
miss
you
guys.
I'm
going
to
miss
a
lot
of
things
like
Len's
endless
And,
of
course,
I'll
miss
-
Hey,
what
is
that?
-
Oh,
my
God.
-
It's
Jake.
I
don't
know.

Pick
up
the
phone!
-
Anna
Reilly.
I
can
only
see
my
reflection.
I
see
you,
what
are
you
doing?
I
tried
to
get
up
there,
but
it's
like
I
decided
to
try
Casanova
here.
I've
been
thinking
about
some
things,

-
Am
I
on
speakerphone?
-
Hi.
-
Can
we
talk?
Can
I
come
over?
Okay.
All
right.
Listen,
I've
been
thinking...
-
And
you
were
right.
About
everything.
About
us,
-
I
acted
like
an
idiot.
ALL:
Yeah,
what
are
you
saying,
Jake?
I'm
saying
that
I
love
you.
I'm
in
love
with
you.
I've
waited
all
my
life
for
someone
Please,
don't
go.
Could
we
get
off
the
phone?

Hello?
What's
going
on?
Anna?
-
She's
gone,
buddy.
Move!

-
Stuff
like
that
never
happens
to
me.


No
crisis
arises
It's
all
very
nice
but
not
very
good
And
I'm
ready
to
take
a
chance
again
Ready
to
put
my
love
Living
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
You
get
what
you
get
And
I'm
ready
to
take
a
chance
again
Ready
to
put
my
love
Than
living
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
You
get
what
you
get
Hey!
-
Everything
okay
here?
All
good
things.
...with
you
Hi.
Rabbi
Lewis.
Anna,
this
is
Rabbi
Lewis.
-
Good
to
see
you
again.
-
You
missed
our
last
class.
-
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.
-
I'd
be
delighted.
If
you'll
excuse
us,
we're
off
dancing.
-
Come
on,
let's
get
this
started.

Attention,
please.
So
great
to
see
such
a
great
turn-out.
-
Thank
you
for
coming.
It's
wonderful
to
see
so
much
Like
the
end
of
West
Side
Story
-
Let's
give
ourselves
a
hand.
Hit
it.

-
Hello.
-
Is
three
a
crowd
here?
Hold
it!

Do
you
want
to
know
If
everything
glittering
I
see
in
your
hair?
Somehow
tonight
And
do
you
want
to
find
Something
worth
saving?
'Cause
I've
been
just
waiting
With
this
heart
of
mine
You're
still
a
mystery
But
there's
something
so
easy
I
feel
completed
For
this
heart
of
mine
There's
always
something
so
tragic
About
a
hopeless
romantic
So
though
we
cannot
know
If
everything
glittering
I'm
through
with
waiting
and
hesitating
I
want
you
taking
This
heart
of
mine
Heart
of
mine
