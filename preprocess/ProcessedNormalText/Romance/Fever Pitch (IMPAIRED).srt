Who

Everton?
OK.
But
this
game's

All
right.
Go

Yes!
What

Oh...stuff.

Yeah?
What
about
him?
Well...
Well...about
his
books.
What
about
his
books?
Just...which
one's

And?

Well,

That's
just
it.

what
and

Mm...
Well,
''Lady

And...?
l
wasn't
thinking
You
amaze
me.
l
was
thinking
about
Arsenal.

staggered.
We
might
win
We're
half-way
through
and
they'll
fuck
it
up
but...
You're
not
impressed,
are
you?
l
am.
l
hope
lt's
just
that...
Why
did
you
lie?
l've
got
to
vary
the
answers.
l
can't
say
Arsenal
every
time.
l
can't
find
any...''Bread''.
Do
l
look
like
the
sort
of
man
who'd
have
a
''Bread''
album?
No,
you
look
like
who
has
a
''Bollock
Brothers''
l
wouldn't
put
that
on.
lt's
a
bit...not
the
right
mood.
Oh?
And
what's
the
right
mood?
Well,
l
don't
know,
just...
something...you
know.
What?
You
know,
just...
something
not
as...
Paul,
that's
the
most
you've
ever
said
to
me.
Shut
up.


By
the
way,

On
what?
Two-nil.
Quinn
and
Dixon.
Goal
in
each
half.
Top
of
the
League.
George
Graham
sees
no
reason
why
Arsenal
shouldn't
bring
for
the
first
time
in
1
6
years.
1
8
years.
l'm
sure
he
said
1
6.
Oh,
right.
Maybe
l'm
wrong.
Yeah,
OK,
OK.
1
8.
Whatever.
So,
when
does
it
all
end?
May.
And
what
happens
Just
sit
in
the
park
and
wait
for
the
fixture
So
what
about
this
summer?
That's
a
good
point.
We
might
be
That
isn't
the
point
We've
been...
well,
we've
been
for
six
months
now.
And
we've
never
even
planned
a
holiday
together.
lt's
a
miracle
before
Friday
afternoon.
And
yet
you
know
for
months
in
advance.
They
produce
a
fixture
list.
Well,
l
can
do
that
for
you.
Give
me
your
diary
and
l'll
put
some
dates
in
it.
Don't
be
daft.
What's
daft
about
it?

You're

To
a
football
match?

Ooh.

you,

you'd
better

yourself.
Soon
after

and
l
split
up,
l
woke
up
one
morning
and
realised

could
for
the
previous

Harmless
enough,

it?
No!
lt's
all
a
sinister
form
of
male
manipulation.
Rubbish!

true!

get
colonised.
Your

by

about.
They're

They

off!

Shut
up!

Yes.

comes
you

a
ticket
in
the
Reading

to

it
off

How
much

that

you?
Fiver.

near

was
standing
with

with
Jenkins?
What
would

You
must've

to

Perhaps

the

Pretty
good.
And
l've
been
very
much
involved
in
the
pastoral
side
of
things
as
a
form
teacher.
And
we
understand
that,
um,
you're
an

Um...yes.

That's
one
of
the

to

of

about

seasons!
We

our
lives
January
through
to
December.
Not
all
of
us.
Yes,
all
of
us.
Even
you.
Do
you
understand
You

how
long
l've
Yes,
l
do.
1
8
years.
Yeah,
1
8
years!
l've
wanted
Arsenal
longer
than
l've
l've
been
after
for
about
two
weeks.
You
think
l'd
care
No,
you
care
more
about
one
team
scoring
more
than
another.
You
thought
l
came
For
a
moment,
yeah.
l
credited
you
with
imagination.
Thought
you
might
understand.
lt's
only
a
game.
DON'T
SAY
THAT!
Please!
That
is
the
worst,
most
stupid
thing
lt
quite
clearly
lf
it
was,
d'you
honestly
Eh?
1
8
years!
1
8...years!
D'you
know
what
you
wanted
1
8
years
ago?
Or
ten?
Or
five?
Did
you
wanna
be
Head
of
Year
at
a
North
London
comprehensive?
l
doubt
if
you've
wanted
And
if
you
had,
and
if
you'd
spent
three
months
thinking
that
finally
and
just
when
it's
taken
away
from
you!
l
don't
care
what
it
is
-
a
car,
a
job,
an
Oscar.
The
baby.
Then
you'd
understand
how
l
was
feeling
tonight.
But
there
isn't
So
what?
So...fuck
off?
Go
home?
Leave
you
alone?
Whatever.
There
isn't
anything
because
l
was
a
kid
lf
l
did
still
want
the
same
l
don't
want
have
bigger
tits,
do
well
in
my
mock
'O's.
l've
stopped
worrying
Maybe
there's
a
big
bit
Maybe
everyone
they've
always
wanted.
l
don't
know
How
d'you
mean?
We've
both
been
pretending
and
it's
not,
is
it?
This
wife
and
kids
and
la-di-da
life's
great
stuff.
lt's
not
on,
any
of
it,
is
it?
All
it
took
was
and
we're
now
back
to
''life
is

lS
the
point?
l
don't

a
sturdy
enough
basis
No.
Not
even

Nigel?'

Hello?
'How

you?'
Oh,

you
tomorrow.
Bye,
Mum.

Mr
Ashworth,
the
play
five
minutes
ago.
No
good,
Miss.
Have
you
had
a
row?


Shut
up,
Holly.
OK,
everyone
into
the
hall.
Quietly!
How
did
Arsenal
YOU
have
a
look.
Ooh...sorry.
They
drew
two-two.
What
does
that
mean?
Dunno.
Apart
from
bad.
lt
means
they
have
to
win
the
Championship.
Now,
l've
heard
of
Liverpool.
They're
famous
Gary
Lineker,
So
Arsenal
have
no
chance?
None
whatsoever,
it
says
here.
But
do
we
really
CARE
that
much?
Don't
bounce
it
in
here.
Miss
Hughes.
Are
you
chewing?
No.
And
finally,
l
probably
that
the
final
Schools
Cup
Competition
this
afternoon
at
4.30.
l'm
sure
you
join
me
in
wishing
Mr
Ashworth
the
very
best
of
luck.
Not
that
they'll
need
it.
l
know
that
many
of
you
will
be
anxious
to
get
home
to
start
your
homework.
But...those
who
feel
and
wish
to
lend
will
be
most
welcome.
Thank
you.
l
think
you
stand
an
extremely
good
chance...



How
are
we
doing?
Losing
one-nil.
Playing
shit.
How
long
to
go?
Almost
finished.


Penalty!
Come

Good

Robert.



Rob!
You're

Sorry,

Anyway...
