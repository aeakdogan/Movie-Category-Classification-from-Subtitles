Fuck!
You

records,

twat!
I

Ow!
Nob

If
Dad
knew
you
smoked
that
stuff,
What?
Fuck

will
you?
Twat.

TONY:
Here

go,
Dad!
Come
on,
man.
Dad!
Hurry
up,
Dad,

We'll
be

I'm

you,
the
whole
frigging
world's
Oi!
You

our
room.
Dad!
There's
not
much
of
this
coal
left.
It's
fine.
Don't
kid
yourself.
I'm
not
waiting
for
youse.
Tony.
Tony!
See
you
down
the
picket
line,
Dad.

Leave
it,
Billy.
Mom
would've
let
us.

JACKIE:
Your
50
pence
is
on
the
fridge.
MEN:

Scab!
Scab!
Scab!
Are
you
sure
you're
not
going
to
come?
Am
I
fuck.
It's
a
right
load
of
old
bollocks.
No,
it's
not.
It's
a
load
of
shite,
kicking
people
in.
Anyway,
I
don't
know
why
you
bother.
-
I'm
good
at
it.
Look
at
them
gloves,
man.
They're
me
dad's,
these.
Exactly.
GEORGE:
Right,
lads.
Listen
up
here.
Hold
it!
Oi,
oi!
Here!
Now,
because
they're
using
downstairs
I'm
going
to
let
Mrs
Wilkinson
use
the
bottom
end
of
the
boxing
hall
So
no
hanky-panky.
Understood?
KIDS:
Yes.
Elliot,
you're
late.
Get
changed
and
get
in
here.
-
All
right
then,
lads.
Now,
give
it
all
you
got!
Round
one.
Well,
don't
just
stand
there,
Elliot!
No!
Not
again!
This
is
man-to-man
combat,
What're
you
doing,
man?
Hit
him!
Greavesy,
he's
just
pissing
about.
He's
like
a
fanny
in
a
fit.
Billy,
hit
him!

GEORGE:
Jesus
Christ,
Billy
Elliot!
You're
a
disgrace
to
them
gloves,
and
the
traditions
of
this
boxing
hall.
You
owe
us
50
pence.

Liberace,
will
you
give
it
a
rest?

Billy,
punch
bag.

You're
not
going
until
you
do
it
properly.
Give
these
to
Mrs
Wilkinson
I'll
see
you

Do
they

Nobody
around
here,
but
plenty
of
men
do.
-
Poofs.
Who,
like?
What
about
that
Wayne
Sleep?
He's
as
fit

Bet
he
couldn't

not

in

Why

You

It's

If

Nah.
You're

What
are

Naught.
We
found
your
nana
in
the
Spar
stores.
Boxing.
Where
do
you
think?
What're
you
doing?
I
forgot
me
gloves.
They
were
my
dad's
gloves.
You
better
take
better
care
of
them,
okay?
TEACHER:
Copy
down
that
diagram.
Ow.

Hurry.
This
way.
You
go
to
ballet
every
week?
Yeah,
but
don't
tell.
Why
do
you
need
to
take
lessons?
Why
do
you
think?
To
get
better,
you
divvy.
-
Do
you
got
to
wear
a
tutu?
They're
only
meant
for
lasses.
I
wear
me
shorts.
You
won't
ask
for
a
tutu?
What
for?
To
dance
in.
I'd
look
a
right
dickhead.
I
think
you'd
look
wicked.
Come
on.
I
don't
know
why
you're
looking
at
that.
You
can't
take
that
out
on
a
junior
ticket.

Come
on!
See
you,
then.

Look

Ahhh!

Nothing.
Prepare,

Weight
on

legs.
And,
pirouette.
And
down.
Up
you
get.
Find
a
place
on

bloody
wall,
and

on
that
spot.
Then

head
round,
One,

Have
you
got

spot?

Prepare!
-

WILKINSON:
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go,

What
have
I
told
you
about

arm?
Right.

GEORGE:
Listen,

If
it
was
just
the

pence

I
can
do
without
it.

What
are
you
talking
about?

haven't

was
gonna

I
knew
about

Scab!

WILKINSON:
Scab!
Scab!
Scab!

do
it
again.

Open,
and
lift
your
chest.
Thank
you,
Mr
Braithwaite.

Pay
attention.
Arms.
Like
this.
All
right?
Thank
you,
Mr
Braithwaite.
Step
really
open!
Powerful!
Proud!
You're
not
concentrating.
Yes,
I
am
concentrating.
You're
not
even
trying.
Can
we
have
a
go
of
it,
Miss?
MRS
WILKINSON:
Let's
do
it
again.
Listen,
have
you
noticed
What
are
you
after,
like,
a
list?

Aye,
aye.
Got
enough
food
there,
scab?
What're
you
doing?

Scabs
eat
well.
You're

best
mate.

a
union,

all
fucked

you
forget
that!

We're
fucked
anyway.
MAN
ON

Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
referred
to
members
of
the
striking
as
"the
enemy
within".

comes

between
police
officers
and
striking
miners...
-

You,

I
beg
your
pardon?

Please,

Don't.
All
right,
which
way
are
we
facing?
Come
on.
And
a
one,
two,
three,
pas
de

Ballet.
What's
wrong
with
ballet?
What's
"wrong"
with
ballet?
It's
perfectly
normal.
"Perfectly
normal"?
I
used
to
go
to
ballet.
See?
Aye,
for
your
nana.
For
girls.
Not
for
lads,
Billy.
Lads
do
football
or
boxing
or
wrestling!
Not
frigging
ballet.
What
lads
do
wrestling?
Don't
start,
Billy.
I
don't
see
what's
wrong
with
it.
You
know
perfectly
well
what's
wrong
with
it.
-
No,
I
don't.
-
No,
I
don't!
Who
do
you
think
I
am?
You
know
quite
nicely!
What?
What
are
you
trying
to
say,
Dad?
You're
asking
for
a
hiding,
Son.
No,
I'm
not.
Honest.
You
are,
Billy.
Billy!
It's
not
just
poofs,
Dad.
Some
ballet
dancers
are
as
fit
as
athletes.
What
about
that
Wayne
Sleep?
Wayne
Sleep?
Aye.
Listen,
Son,
from
now
on
you
can
forget
You
can
forget
about
the
fucking
boxing,
I'm
busting
my
ass
for
those
50
pences,
From
now
on,
you
stay
here
Good.
They
used
to
say
-
if
I'd
had
the
training.
I
hate
you!
You're
a
bastard!
Get
off!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!



Hello.
My
dad
will
kill
me
if
he
knows
I'm
here.
He
stopped
you
coming
to
classes.
It's
not
his
fault,
Miss.
That's
all
right
with
you,
is
it?
I
suppose
so.
You
should
stand
up
to
him.
You
don't
know
what
he's
like.
Well,
that
blows
it.
Blows
what,
Miss?
Debbie?

TOM:
I've
heard
a
lot
about
you.
Durham's
little
Gene
Kelly.
Your
dad
work
down
the
pit,
then?
Yeah.
Must
be
hard
for
the
family,
He
is
out
on
strike,
isn't
he?
Of
course.
I
shouldn't
worry.
It
won't
last
long.
Tom,
don't.
If
they
had
a
ballot,
they'd
be
back
tomorrow.
It's
just
a
few
bloody
commies,
Let's
face
it.
Who
doesn't?
The
miners.
It
stands
to
reason,
doesn't
it?
Some
pits
are
just
uneconomical.
If
it
costs
more
money
to
pay
everybody
than
you
get
for
the
coal
when
you
sell
it,
Don't
know.
Well,
you
wanna
think
about
that,
MRS
WILKINSON:
Tom.
If
it
was
up
to
me,
For
God's
sake.
What
do
you
do,
Mr
Wilkinson?
DEBBIE:
He's
been
made
redundant.
I
thought
he
was
gonna
hit
me
or
something.
Don't
be
silly.
That's
what
Mom
says.
Does
he
drink
too
much,
like?
He's
always
pissed.
Once
he
pissed
himself.
Your
dad?
'Cause
he's
unhappy
and
that.
Why
do
they
sleep
in
separate
beds?
So
they
can't
have
sex.
Do
they
not
have
sex,
like?
Dad
did
it
with
this
woman
from
work,
Do
you
miss
your
mom,
then?
Don't
really
miss
her
as
such.
Especially
when
I
remember
her
When
I
forgot
that
she
was
dead
and
that.
What
about
your
mom?
No,
she's
unfulfilled.
She
does
dancing
instead
of
sex?
Your
family's
weird.
No,
they're
not.
They
are,
though.
They're
mental.

DEBBIE:
Get
off!
See?
You're
a
nutter,
you.
MRS
WILKINSON:
Come
on,
Billy.
I'll
drop
you
off
at
the
corner.
BILLY:
I'll
see
you,
Debbie.


Okay,
then.
Miss,
what
have
I
blown?

This'll
sound
strange,
Billy,
I've
been
thinking
of
the
Royal
Ballet
School.
Aren't
you
a
bit
old,
Miss?
No,
not
me.
You!
I'm
the
bloody
teacher.
They
hold
auditions
in
Newcastle.
I'd
never
be
good
enough.
No.
Look,
they're
not
interested
in
They
teach
you
that.
It's
how
you
move
and
Express
what?
I
think
you're
good
enough
to
go
for
it.
It
would
mean
an
awful
lot
of
hard
work.
But
I'm
banned.
Then
maybe
I
should
have
a
word
with
him.
No,
Miss!
I
could
teach
you
on
your
own,
if
you
want.
We
couldn't
afford
it.
I'm
not
doing
it
for
the
money,
Billy.
But
what
about
Dad?
He
doesn't
need
to
know.
-
What
about
me
boxing
and
that?
If
you
want
to
piss
about
All
right,
don't
lose
your
blob.
"Blob"?
So
we
could
do
it
private-like?
Just
you
and
me.
Miss,
you
don't
fancy
me,
do
you?
No,
Billy.
Funnily
enough,
I
don't.
Piss
off
yourself.
MRS
WILKINSON:
See
you
Monday,
then.
You
coming
in
or
what?
What
are
you
doing?
Nothing.
Just
dressing
up.
Whose
dress
is
that?
MICHAEL:
Come
on.
-
Whose
dress
is
that?
-
Did
she
give
you
it?
Do
you
wanna
try?
Nah.
You're
all
right.
What're
you
doing
that
for?
I'm
just
trying
it
on.
Christ.
Come
here.
Stay
still.
There.
Won't
we
get
in
trouble?
Don't
be
stupid.
Me
dad
does
it
all
the
time.
He
dresses
up
in
your
mom's
clothes?
Only
when
he
thinks
everybody's
out.
Have
you
got
a
tutu
yet?
Do
you
think
being
a
ballet
dancer
I
don't
know.
It's
just,
I've
got
this
audition
in
Newcastle
-
What
for?
Ballet
school?
Is
that
in
Newcastle?
London.
You'd
have
to
move
No.
By
meself.
That's
a
bit
steep.
Can't
you
be
a
ballet
dancer
here,
like?
Don't
be
stupid!
So,
when
you
going
there,
then?
I
don't
know.
I
haven't
even
got
in
yet.
What
does
your
dad
say?
He
doesn't
know.
Fucking
hell.
Are
you
not
going
to
tell
him?
Not
yet,
anyway.
He
might
be
quite
pleased
about
it.
He
couldn't.
What
about
our
Tony?
What
do
you
reckon?
I
think
you
shouldn't
bother.
Why
not?
I'd
miss
you.
Fucking
hell.
MRS
WILKINSON:
Brought
your
things?
I
don't
know
if
they're
right,
Miss.
MRS
WILKINSON:
BILLY:
What
are
they
for?
MRS
WILKINSON:
Come
on,
then.
Let's
see
them.
What's
that?
It's
a
letter.
I
can
see
it's
a
letter.
It's
me
mom's.
She
wrote
it
for
when
I
was
18,
Here.
"To
my
son
Billy.
"Dear
Billy.
"I
know
I
must
seem
"which
is
probably
a
good
thing.
"It
will
have
been
a
long
time,
"and
I
will
have
missed
seeing
you
grow.
"Missed
you
crying,
laughing,
"and
shouting."
"I
will
have
missed
telling
you
off.
"But

BILLY:
Can
I
put
a
tape
on,
Miss?
MRS
WILKINSON:
All
right,
if
you
must.

BILLY:
It's
cush,
isn't
it?
So,
is
there
a
story,
then,
Miss?
Of
course.
It's
about
a
woman
Sounds
crap.
And
this
woman,
this
beautiful
woman,
is
forced
to
be
a
swan.
Except
for
a
few
hours
every
night
when
she
becomes
alive.
When
she
becomes
real
again.
And
then
one
night,
she
meets
this
young
prince,
and
he
falls
in
love
with
her.
And
she
realizes,
this
is
the
one
thing
that
will
allow
her
So
then
what
happens?
He
promises
to
marry
her
and
then
So
she
has
to
be
a
swan
for
good?
She
dies.
Because
the
prince
didn't
love
her?
Come
on.
It's
time
to
go.
It's
only
a
ghost
story.
Come
on!
No!
No.
No.
It's
me.
It's
Billy.
Little
one.

Oi!
Little

foot.
And

And

Lift

And

Tomorrow
morning.
I'll

Who

you
think's
better?
Billy,

you
not
fancy

like?
Don't

Never

thought
about

If

MRS
WILKINSON:

Billy

Audition?
For
the
Royal
Ballet
School.
The
Royal
Ballet?
School.
It's
where
they
teach
the
ballet.
You've
got
to
be
joking,
love.
No,
I'm
perfectly
serious.
Have
you
any
idea
of
I've
been
in
a
fucking
cell
all
night,
and
you
come
around
here
talking
shite!
And,
you!
Fucking
ballet!
What
are
you
trying
to
do,
make
him
Look
at
him!
He's
only
11,
for
fuck's
sake!
You've
gotta
start
training
Shut
it!
I'm
not
having
any
brother
of
mine
running
Excuse
me.
This
is
not
for
my
gratification.
And
what
good's
it
gonna
do
him?
He's
only
a
bairn!
I
don't
want
a
childhood.
And
anyway,
what
do
you
know
about
it?
What
qualifications
have
you
got?
I
haven't
come
here
to
defend
meself.
Well,
for
all
we
know,
I
should
get
the
fucking
Social
on
to
you.
I
think
you
should
calm
yourself
down,
son.
You
say
he
can
dance.
Well,
go
on,
then.
-
Let's
see
this
fucking
dancing.
This
is
ridiculous.
If
you're
a
fucking
ballet
dancer,
Don't
you
dare!
TONY:
What
sort
of
a
teacher
are
you?
He's
got
the
chance
to
dance.
Dance,
you
little
twat!
No?
So
piss
off.
He's
not
doing
any
more
fucking
ballet,
and
if
you
go
anywhere
near
him
again,
You
know
nothing
about
me,
He
won't
grow
up
to
race
whippets,
He's
been
with
me...


Ahhh!
MICHAEL:
Billy!
Billy!


MICHAEL:
Billy!
Billy,
come
on!
Hurry
up.
GEORGE:
Merry
Christmas,
everybody!




Do
you
think
she'll
mind?
Shut
it,
Billy.
She's
dead.
Well,
Merry
Christmas,
everybody.
-
Merry
Christmas.
Merry
Christmas.



Fucking
great
Christmas
this
has
been.
Go
on.
Have
some.
Where'd
you
get
it?
-
Me
dad's
got
loads
in
the
kitchen.
He
never
knows
how
much
is
there.

Tastes
like
piss.
You
get
used
to
it.
Here.
Maybe
you
could
run
away
or
something.
You
know,
join
a
dancing
troupe.
Don't
be
so
stupid.
Well,
maybe
it's
all
for
the
best.
What
do
you
mean?
You
won't
have
to
go
away
or
nothing.
My
hands
are
freezing.
Give
us
them
here.
What
are
you
doing?
Nothing.
Just
warming
your
hands
up.
You're
not
a
poof
or
aught?
What
gave
you
that
impression?
Aren't
me
hands
cold?
I
quite
like
it.
Just
'cause
I
like
ballet
doesn't
mean
I'm
a
poof,
you
know?

Come
on.
It's
fucking
freezing
in
here.
Here.
-
What's
this?
A
tutu.

George.
George.
...this
kangaroo,
And
he's
called
Norman.

And
then
round
the
corner
came
this
wallaby.
Plié,
first.
What's
a
plié?
It's
French.
Why's
it
French?
I
don't
know.
Second.
Like
a
princess.
Second,
and
down.
And
first.
Carry
on.
Fifth.
Shoulders
down,
long
neck.
How
do
I
look?
Shut

poof.
Fuck

And

Fifth.
Second.
Down.
First.

Jackie.
Jackie,
man.
Here.
Give
us
your
hand.

MICHAEL:
Dance!

Dad!
Go
home,
Son.


Is
this
a
friend
of
yours,
then?
How
much
is
it
gonna
cost?
And
a
happy
Christmas
to
you,
too.
Not
as
much
as
you
might
think.
-
But
there's
a
good
chance
the
council's...
I
was
talking
about
the
auditions.
Look,
it's
just
a
matter
of
the
trip
to
London.
I'll
give
you
the
money
for
the
fare.
I
didn't
come
here
to
be
patronized.
Oh,
no
one's
trying
to
patronize
you.
-
Am
I?

Thanks
for
everything
you've
done
for
Billy.
But

London.
I

know,

Have

go
to
London?
It's
the
capital

Nerve-racking,

amazing

Now,
Billy,
Do
you
have
a
piece
prepared?



MAN:
Thank
you.
You
all
right?
What's
the
matter?
It
was
a
waste
of
fucking
time!
Don't
be
upset.
It's
only
a
stupid
audition.

It's
all
right.
There's

year.
Look,

Such
displays

Do
you
understand?
I
realize
we
shall
have
to
and
it
will
be
bound
to
Yes,
well,
just
a
few
questions,
then.
Billy,
can
you
tell
us
why
you
first
became
Don't
know.
Just
was.
Well,
was
there
any
particular
which
caught
your
imagination?
The
dancing.
He
dances
all
the
time.
Yes.
Well,
we
have
a
very
enthusiastic
letter
and
she
has
told
us
of
Mr
Elliot,
are
you
a
fan
of
the
ballet?
I
wouldn't
exactly
say
I
was
an
expert.
You
do
realize
that
all
pupils
not
just
in
ballet,
No
child
can
succeed
You
are
completely
behind
Billy.
Are
you
not?
Yes.
Yes,
of
course.
Do
you
want
to
ask
us
any
questions?

No,
not
really.
No.
MAN:
Well,
in
that
case,
we
shall
let
you
know
in
due
course.
WOMAN:
Just
one
last
question.
Can
I
ask
you,
Billy,
what
does
it
feel
like
when
you're
dancing?
Don't
know.
Sort
of
feels
good.
It's
sort
of
stiff
and
that,
then
I
forget
everything.
And,
sort
of
disappear.
Sort
of
disappear.
Like
I
feel
a
change
in
me
whole
body.
Like
there's
fire
in
me
body.
I'm
just
there,
flying.
Like
a
bird.
Like
electricity.
Yeah.
Like
electricity.
Have
a
safe
journey
home.
Mr
Elliot,
good
luck
with
the
strike.
GRANDMA:
Toast!
I
think
you
should
get
yourself
a
trade,
son.
Something
useful.
I
could
have
been
a
professional
dancer.
What
happened
to
the
dinosaurs,
Miss?
TEACHER:
They
were
crushed
as
well,
and
the
pressure
of

of

We're

BILLY:
I

I'm
scared,
Dad.
JACKIE:
That's
okay,
Son.
We're
all
scared.
Well,
if
I
don't
like
it,
can
I
still
come
back?
You
kidding?
We've
let

I

Look,

Well,

everything.

Good-bye,

See

Oi!
Dancing

JACKIE:
We'll
miss
the

Will
you
stop
being
an
old
fucking

See
you,
then.




TONY:
I'll
miss
you.
What?
Can't
hear
you.


Dad.
Come
