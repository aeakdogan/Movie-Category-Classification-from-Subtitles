in
a
one-act
play,
and
I
was
rehearsing.
I
know
both
parts
because
And
something.
Hm.
What's
the
play
about?
Steam
ships.
I
wouldn't
do
it
around
him.
That's
when
they
get
you,
you
see?
When
you're
not
focused.

I
didn't
do
it,
you
know.
I'm
sorry?
Oh,
yeah,
He's
a
liar,
okay?
He
never
treats
us
To
get
us
to
move,
with
a
nail
in
the
end
of
it.
One
day,
I
guess
I
wasn't
walking
so
he
swung
the
stick
at
me,
but
I
He
told
everyone
I
attacked
him.
Wow,
I
never
knew
any
of
that.
And
my
only
mistake
was
assuming
I
guess
that's
what
humans
do.
They
lie.
Not
all
humans,
Bernie.
Look,
now,
but
sometimes
we
need
and
look
towards
the
future,
I
guess
sometimes
Yeah.
Look,
is
there
anything
else
Can
you
get
me
my
view
back?
You
know,
it's
not
my
call.

miss
it,
you
know?
I
used
to
be
able
that
I
could
just
catch
a
glimpse
Now
all
I
see
is
cement.

I've

I

about...
Everything
just
turned
light
blue.
Are
you
okay?
Okay,
I'm
good.
I
was
thinking
about
the
wedding.
I
was

needed
Oh,
look,
Griffin,
Yeah?
I'm
gonna
go
to

He
was
supposed
to

and
we
had

long
talk
I
hope
you
understand.

And
I
hope
you
understand
that
Really?
Okay.
All

Bye.
Get
ready
to
experience

You
said
to
out
her
You
see,
this
is
what
happens.
We
didn't
tell
you
to
back
down.
Stick
to
your
cozy
life
because
take
it
from
me,
What
did
you
just
say?
In
the
wild,
I
would
never
let
a
rival
"In
the
wild"?
In
this
very
zoo.
"In
the
wild."
You've
never
been
I
could
walk
25

"Wild."
Whether
you're
taking
out
a
rival
it's
not
just
the
attack,
The
females
in
the
pride,
We
do.
And
the
fighting.
Okay,
you
know
what?
If
you
are,
I
don't
need
to
be
here.
Relax,
Joe.
The
best
way
for
a
male
is
to
be
seen
with
another
female.
If
he's
going
to
the
wedding,
That's
it.
Good
night.

a
date,

I'll
do
that.
