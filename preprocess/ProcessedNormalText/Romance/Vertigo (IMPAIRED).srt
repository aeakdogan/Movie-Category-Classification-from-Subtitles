Give
me
your
hand!
Give
me
your
hand!


Ouch!
Ouch!
-
I
thought
you
said
no
more
pains.
No
three-way
stretch?
How
very
un-chic.
Well,
you
know
those
police
department
-
Anyway,
tomorrow
will
be
the
day.
Tomorrow?
I'll
be
able
to
scratch
myself,
I'll
throw
Be
a
free...
free
man.
Midge,
do
you
suppose
-
Mm,
more
than
you
think.
You
know
that
Please.
What
happens
after
tomorrow?
-
What
do
you
mean?
-
Once
you
quit
the
police
force.
No,
it's
your
life.
But
you
were
that
decided
he
was
going
-
I
had
to
quit.
Because
of
this
fear
of
heights
I
have,
I
wake
up
at
nights
seeing
that
man
fall
-
It
wasn't
your
fault.
-
Johnnie,
the
doctors
explained...
I
have
acrophobia
Boy...
what
a
moment
to
find
out
I
had
it.
Well,
there's
no
losing
it.
You
mean
sit
behind
a
desk?
-
Where
you
belong.
Suppose
I'm
sitting
and
a
pencil
falls
to
the
floor,
-
bingo,
my
acrophobia's
back.
Well,
what'll
you
do?
I'm
not
going
to
do
anything
for
a
while.
I'm
a
man
of
independent
means,
-
Fairly
independent.
-
Why
don't
you
go
away
for
a
while?
Oh,
Midge,
don't
be
so
motherly.
Have
you
had
any
dizzy
spells
I'm
having
one
right
now.
The
music,
don't
you
think
it's
sort
of...
Oh.
What's
this
doohickey?
It's
a
brassiere.
You
know
about
those
things,
I've
never
run
across
one
like
that.
It's
brand-new.
Revolutionary
uplift.
but
it
does
everything
It
works
like
a
cantilever
bridge.
It
does?
Aircraft
engineer
down
the
peninsula
worked
it
out
in
his
spare
time.
Kind
of
a
hobby.
Oh.
A
do-it-yourself
type
thing.
How's
your
love
life,
Midge?
That's
following
a
train
of
thought.
Well...
Normal.
Aren't
you
ever
gonna
get
married?
You
know
there's
only
one
man
for
me.
You
mean
me.
We
were
engaged
once,
weren't
we?
-
Three
whole
weeks.
You
were
the
one
I'm
still
available.
Available
Ferguson.
Do
you
remember
a
fellow
in
college
-
Gavin
Elster?
You'd
think
I
would.
No.
I
had
a
call
from
Gavin
today.
Somebody
said
he
went
east.
It's
a
Mission
number.
-
That's
skid
row,
isn't
it?
He's
probably
on
the
bum
I'll
buy
him
a
couple
of
drinks
But
not
tonight,
-
Sorry,
old
man,
work.
Midge,
what
did
you
mean,
-
What?
I
asked
my
doctor,
he
said
only
another
and
probably
wouldn't.
Don't
dive
off
another
rooftop
I
think
I
can
lick
it.
-
How?
I
think
if
I
can
get
used
to
heights,
Just
a
little
like
that.
Here.
I'll
show
you
what
I
mean.
-
We'll
start
with
this.
You
want
me
to
start
Watch
this.
Here
we
go.
There.
There.
Now,
I
look
up,
I
look
down.
I
look
up...
-
You're
kidding.
Wait
a
minute.
-
Here.
We'll
use
that.
Put
it
right
there.
All
right.
Here's
the
first
step.
There.
OK,
now
step
number
two.
All
right,
step
number
two
coming
up.
There
we
are.
I'm
going
to
buy
myself
-
Take
it
easy.
No
problem.
This
is
a
cinch.
I
look
up,
I
look
down.
I
look
up,
I
look
down.
Oh,
Johnnie,
Johnnie.
How
did
you
get
I
married
into
it.
-
Very
interesting
business.
You
don't
have
to
do
it
for
a
living.
No,
but
one
assumes
responsibilities.
My
wife's
family
has
all
gone,
Her
father's
partner
runs
So
I
decided,
as
long
as
-
I've
always
liked
it
here.
-
Almost
a
year.
Well,
San
Francisco's
changed.
The
things
that
spell
San
Francisco
-
Like
all
these?
Colour,
excitement,
power,
freedom.
-
Er,
shouldn't
you
be
sitting
down?
I
was
sorry
to
read
about
And
you've
quit
the
force,
No.
No,
it
just
means
I
can't
climb
like
the
bar
at
the
Top
of
the
Mark.
But
there
are
street-level
bars
Would
you
like
a
drink
now?
No,
I
don't
think
so,
Well,
I
guess
that
just
about
I
never
married,
I'm
a
retired
detective
What's
on
your
mind,
Gavin?
I
asked
you
here,
Scottie,
but
I
wondered
whether
you'd
go
back
I
want
you
to
follow
my
wife.
-
We're
very
happily
married.
-
I'm
afraid
some
harm
may
come
to
her.
Someone
dead.
Scottie,
do
you
believe
that
someone
can
enter
and
take
possession
No.
If
I
told
you
I
believed
this
has
happened
I'd
say
take
her
to
the
nearest
or
neurologist
I'd
have
him
check
on
you
too.
Then
you're
of
no
use
to
me,
Thanks
for
coming
in,
Scottie.
OK.
I,
er...
I
didn't
mean
to
be
that
rough.
It
sounds
idiotic,
I
know.
You're
still
the
hard-headed
Scot,
Always
were.
-
You
think
I'm
making
it
up?
I'm
not
making
it
up,
She'll
be
talking
to
me
about
something
and
suddenly
the
words
fade
a
cloud
comes
into
her
eyes
She's
somewhere
else,
away
from
me,
I
call
to
her,
she
doesn't
even
hear
me.
Then,
with
a
long
sigh,
she's
back.
Looks
at
me
brightly.
Doesn't
even
know
she's
been
away,
Well...
how
often
does
this
happen?
More
and
more
in
the
past
few
weeks.
And
she
wanders.
I
followed
her
one
day,
watched
her
Someone
I
didn't
know,
Got
into
her
car
five
miles.
Sat
by
the
lake,
staring
across
the
water
you
know,
the
Portals
of
the
Past.
Sat
there
a
long
time
without
moving.
I
had
to
leave,
get
back
to
the
office.
When
I
got
home,
She
said
she'd
driven
to
Golden
Gate
Well?
The
speedometer
on
her
car
showed
Where
did
she
go?
I've
got
to
know
where
she
goes
and
-
Have
you
talked
to
doctors?
I
want
to
know
more
before
OK,
I'll
get
a
firm
of
private
eyes
-
They're
dependable.
Look,
this
isn't
my
line.
Scottie,
I
need
a
friend,
I'm
supposed
to
be
retired,
We're
going
to
an
opening
we're
dining
at
Ernie's
first.
You
can
see
her
there.
Ernie's.





Will
you
tell
me
something?
That
lady,
who's
the
woman
That's
Carlotta.
You'll
find
it
-
May
I
have
this?
Thank
you.


Yes?
Is
there
something
I
can
do
for
you?
-
You
run
this
hotel?
Who
has
the
room
on
That
corner.
Oh,
we
couldn't
give
out
Our
clients
are
entitled
their
privacy.
And
I
do
believe
it's
against
the
law.
Of
course,
I
don't
think
any
of
them
Oh,
dear.
Has
she
done
Please
answer
my
question.
-
I
can't
imagine
that
sweet
girl...
Valdes.
Miss
Valdes.
Spanish,
you
know.
-
Carlotta
Valdes?
Sweet
name,
isn't
it?
Foreign
but
sweet.
-
How
long
has
she
had
the
room?
Her
rent's
due
tomorrow.
-
Does
she
sleep
here
ever?
two
or
three
times
a
week.
I
don't
ask
questions,
-
I
must
say...
But
she
hasn't
been
here
today.
I
saw
her
come
in
five
minutes
ago.
No,
she
hasn't
been
here
at
all.
I
would've
seen
her
-
putting
olive
oil
There.
There,
you
see.
Would
you
please
go
up
and
look?
-
To
her
room?
Of
course,
if
you
ask.
-
But
it
does
seem
silly.
Oh,
Mr
Detective?
Would
you
like
to
come
and
look?
-
Her
car's
gone.
Midge...
who
do
you
know
that's
That's
the
kind
of
greeting
a
girl
likes.
Not,
''Hello,
you
look
wonderful,''
just,
-
Want
a
drink?
Well,
who
do
you?
-
Professor
Saunders,
over
in
Berkeley.
I
mean
the
small
stuff,
Oh.
You
mean
the
Gay
Old
Bohemian
Juicy
stories
like
who
shot
who
-
That's
right.
-
Who?
He
owns
the
Argosy
Book
Shop.
Who
shot
who
in
the
Embarcadero
Wait
a
minute,
you're
not
a
detective
-
You
know
him
well?
-
Pop
Leibel.
Let's
go.
I
want
you
to
introduce
me.
I
don't
need
a
hat.
Hey,
Johnnie,
what's
it
all
about?
Hey!
Wait
a
minute!
Oh,
yes.
I
remember.
Carlotta.
The
beautiful
Carlotta.
The
sad
Carlotta.
What
does
an
old
house
on
Eddy
It
was
hers.
It
was
built
for
her
-
By
whom?
By,
er...
Hm.
No.
The
name
I
do
not
remember.
A
rich
man,
a
powerful
man.
Cigarette?
-
No,
thank
you.
No,
thank
you.
It
is
not
an
unusual
story.
She
came
from
somewhere
small
Some
say
from
a
mission
settlement.
She
was
found
dancing
and
singing
And
he
took
her
and
built
for
her
in
the
Western
Addition.
And,
er...
There
was
a...
There
was
a
child.
Yes,
that's
it,
a
child.
A
child.
I
cannot
tell
you
exactly
or
how
much
happiness
there
was.
But,
then
-
he
threw
her
away.
He
had
no
other
children,
So,
he
kept
the
child
and
threw
her
away.
You
know,
a
man
could
do
that
They
had
the
power
and
the
freedom.
And
she
became
the
sad
Carlotta,
alone
in
the
great
house,
walking
the
streets
alone,
her
clothes
becoming
old
And
the
mad
Carlotta,
stopping
people
in
the
streets
to
ask,
''Where
is
my
child?
''Have
you
seen
my
child?
''
-
Poor
thing.
-
She
died.
By
her
own
hand.
Hm!
There
are
many
such
stories.
-
Thank
you,
Mr
Leibel.
-
I
appreciate
it.
Wait
a
minute.
-
Now
then,
pay
me.
-
For
bringing
you
here.
Come
on,
tell.
Tell
or
you'll
be
back
in
that
corset.
Come
on,
I'll
take
you
home.
-
Here
you
are.
-
I've
told
you
enough.
-
Out!
I've
got
things
to
do.
-
the
one
that
phoned,
Elster.
The
idea
is
that
the
beautiful
Carlotta
and
taken
possession
of
Elster's
wife.
Johnnie,
really,
come
on!
I'm
not
telling
you
what
I
think
-
What
do
you
think?
-
Is
she
pretty?
No,
not
Carlotta.
Elster's
wife.
Yes,
I
guess
you'd
consider
I
think
I'll
go
take
a
look
at
that
portrait.
-
Midge...
Midge!
You...
You've
done
well.
That's
Carlotta
Valdes.
-
I
didn't
know
where
she'd
lead
you.
You
notice
the
way
she
does
her
hair?
There's
something
else
-
has
several
pieces
of
jewellery
She
inherited
them.
Never
wore
them,
Until
now.
Now,
when
she's
alone,
Handles
them,
gently,
curiously.
Puts
them
on
Then
goes
into
that
other
world,
Carlotta
Valdes
was
what,
Great-grandmother.
The
child
who
was
taken
from
her,
whose
loss
drove
Carlotta
mad
was
Madeleine's
grandmother.
And
the
McKittrick
Hotel
I
think
that
explains
it.
Anyone
could
with
a
background
like
that.
She
never
heard
of
Carlotta
Valdes.
She
knows
nothing
of
a
grave
or
that
old
house
on
Eddy
Street,
the
portrait
at
-
Nothing.
She's
no
longer
my
wife.
How
do
you
know
Her
mother
told
me
most
of
them
I
dug
out
the
rest
here.
-
Why
wouldn't
she
tell
her
daughter?
Her
grandmother
went
insane
Her
blood
is
in
Madeleine.
Boy,
I
need
this.

Madeleine.
Madeleine?

Where
is
my
child...

Yes?
No,
it's
all
right.
I'll
call
you
back.
Yes.
Yes.
Are
you
all
right?
Oh.
Oh,
you'll,
er...
You'll
want
this.
You
better
come
over
here
by
the
fire
What
am
I
doing
here?
What
happened?
Well,
you...
fell
into
San
Francisco
Bay.
I
had
to
dry
your
hair
as
best
I
could.
Your
things
are
in
the
kitchen,
Come
on
over
by
the
fire.
Here,
I'll
give
you
some
cushions.
There
you
are.
Would
you
like
to
have
some
coffee?
You'd
better
have
some.
I
fell
into
the
Bay
and
you
fished
me
out?
That's
right.
-
Thank
you.
No,
I...
Do
you
remember
where
you
were?
Yes.
Yes,
of
course
I
remember
that.
Then
I
must
have
had
Where
were
you?
At
Old
Fort
Point,
out
at
the
Presidio.
Of
course
I
remember.
I
often
go
there.
Why?
Why
do
you
go
there?
Because
I
love
it
so.
-
Thank
you
for
the
fire.
-
When?
-
Wandering
about.
Downtown,
shopping.
Here,
you
better
have
some
coffee.
I
think
it's
still
warm.
You're
terribly
direct
in
your
questions.
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to
be
rude.
You're
not.
You're
merely
direct.
What
were
you
doing
at
Old
Fort
Point?
Oh,
just
wandering
about.
-
You
like
it
too?
Where
had
you
been
just
before?
I'd
been
to
the
Palace
of
Oh,
yes.
That's
a
lovely
spot,
isn't
it?
I've
never
been
inside
It's
lucky
for
me
you
were
-
I've
been
a
terrible
bother
to
you.
Oh...
When
you,
um...
There
were
some
pins
in
my
hair?
Oh,
the
pins?
And
my
purse,
please.
-
Here
you
are.
-
You
shouldn't
have
brought
me
here.
You
could've
looked
in
my
car.
But
then
I
knew
which
one
it
was
-
but
I
didn't
think
you
wanted
You're
right.
I'm
glad
you
didn't
I
wouldn't
have
known
you.
Thank
you.
But
we
don't
know
each
other.
-
My
name
is
John
Ferguson.
-
Your
friends
call
you
John
or
Jack?
Old
friends
call
me
John,
-
I
shall
call
you
Mr
Ferguson.
After
this
afternoon,
maybe
even
John.
Well,
I
prefer
John.
There,
that's
done.
-
Wander
about.
And
you
live
here,
alone?
-
One
shouldn't
live
alone.
No,
it's
wrong.
I'm
married,
you
know.
Will
you
tell
me
something?
-
What?
Oh.
No,
it's
never
happened
before.
I've
fallen
into
lakes
I
fell
into
the
river
once,
But
I've
never
fallen
into
-
Have
you
ever
before?
-
Here,
I'll
get
you
some
more
coffee.
-
Hello?
No,
she's
all
right.
-
'What
happened?
'
Hello?
-
'Did
she
hurt
herself?
'
But
she
doesn't
know
-
she
doesn't
know
what
happened.
-
'Scottie,
Madeleine
is
26.'
'Carlotta
Valdes
committed
suicide
-

Well
now,
Johnnie-o,
was
it
a
ghost?
Was
it
fun?
Is
that
for
me?
-
Yes,
hello.
I
worried
about
you
last
night,
I
suddenly
felt
such
a
fool.
I
wanted
to
drive
you
home.
-
Are
you
all
right?
-
The
water
was
cold,
wasn't
it?
What
a
terrible
thing
for
me
to
do.
It's
a
formal
thank
you
note,
-
You've
nothing
to
apologise
for.
It
must've
been
so
embarrassing
for
you.
Not
at
all,
I
enjoyed...
talking
to
you.
Well,
I
enjoyed
talking
to
you.
Well,
I'll
get
my
mail.
-
Would
you
like
a
cup
of
coffee?
I
couldn't
mail
it,
But
I
had
a
landmark
-
Coit
Tower.
First
time
I've
been
grateful
-
I
hope
we
will
too.
-
Meet
again
sometime.
Goodbye.
-
Where
are
you
going?
-
Shopping?
Well,
anywhere
in
particular?
No,
I
just
thought
I'd
wander.
Oh...
That's
what
I
was
going
to
do.
Oh,
yes,
that's
right.
Don't
you
think
it's
a
waste
for
us...
-
To
wander
separately?
Only
one
is
a
wanderer,
two
together
No,
I
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
You've
left
your
door
open.
Be
right
back.

How
old?
-
The
oldest
living
things.
-
You've
never
been
here
before?
What
are
you
thinking?
Of
all
the
people
who've
been
born
and
Their
true
name
is
always
green,
ever-living.
-
I
don't
like
them.
Knowing
I
have
to
die...
Here's
a
cross
section
of
one
of
Somewhere
in
here
I
was
born,
and
there
I
died.
It
was
only
a
moment
for
you,
Madeleine.
Madeleine.
Madeleine,
where
are
you
now?
-
Here
with
you.
-
Tall
trees...
-
Yes.
When
were
you
born?
-
Long
ago.
-
Tell
me.
Madeleine,
tell
me.
Where
do
you
go,
what
takes
you
away?
You
didn't
know
where
you
were
I
didn't
jump,
I
fell
-
you
told
me.
-
Why
did
you
jump?
-
What
told
you
to
jump?
What?
What?
Please
don't
ask
me.
Take
me
away
from
here.
Shall
I
take
you
home?
Somewhere
in
the
light.
Promise
me
something,
promise
Why
did
you
run?
I'm
responsible
for
you
now.
The
Chinese
say
that
you're
responsible
for
it
forever,
I
have
to
know.
There's
so
little
that
I
know.
It's
as
though
I
were
walking
that
once
was
mirrored.
Fragments
of
that
mirror
still
hang
there
and
when
I
come
to
there's
nothing
but
darkness.
And
I
know
that
when
I
walk
that
I'll
die.
But
I've
never
come
to
the
end,
-
Except
once.
And
you
didn't
know
what
happened
You
didn't
know
where
you
were.
But
the
fragments
of
the
mirror,
-
Vaguely.
There's
a
room...
and
I
sit
there
alone,
always
alone.
-
What
else?
-
Where?
It's
an
open
grave
and
I...
I
stand
by
the
gravestone
It's
my
grave.
-
How
do
you
know?
Is
there
a
name
on
the
gravestone?
No.
No,
it's
new
and...
clean
and
waiting.
What
else?
This
part
is
dream,
I
think.
There...
There's
a
tower
and
a
bell,
It
seems
to
be
in
Spain,
It
clicks
off
and
it's
gone.
Well...
a
portrait?
-
Do
you
see
a
portrait?
If
I
could
just
find
the
key,
And
so
explain
it
away?
There
is
a
way
to
explain
it,
you
see.
If
I'm
mad,
then
that
would
explain
it,
Madeleine!
Oh,
Scottie!
I'm
not
mad!
I'm
not
mad!
There's
someone
within
me
-
Scottie,
don't
let
me
go.
-
I've
got
you.
-
Don't
leave
me,
stay
with
me.


-
Hi,
Johnnie.
-
Did
you
get
my
message?
-
I'll
get
you
a
drink.
Since
when
do
you
go
around
Since
I
can't
get
them
on
the
phone.
For
a
man
with
nothing
to
do,
-
Where
do
you
go
these
days?
-
Where?
What
was
this...
what
was
All
I
said
in
my
note
was,
That
doesn't
sound
very
desperate.
I
detected
a
little
undercurrent.
Well,
I
thought
if
I
gave
you
a
drink
you'd
take
me
to
a
movie.
That's
fair
enough.
-
What
will
we
talk
about
at
dinner?
-
What
I've
been
doing?
Naturally,
we
won't
talk
about
anything
Naturally.
What
have
you
been
doing?
Wandering.
What
have
you
been
doing?
I've
been
having
a
wonderful
time.
I've
gone
back
to
my
first
love,
painting.
Good,
I
said
you
were
wasting
your
time
That's
a
living
What
is
it?
Still
life?
No,
not
exactly.
-
You
want
to
see?
As
a
matter
of
fact,
Johnnie...
It's
not
funny,
Midge.
-
Johnnie?
-
Johnnie,
I
just
thought...
Oh,
er...
Let's
make
that
movie
some
other
night.
Johnnie?
Oh,
Marjorie
Wood,
you
fool!
Idiot!
Stupid!
Stupid!


-
Madeleine.
What's
the
matter?
-
I
wanted
to
be
with
you.
I
had
the
dream.
You're
going
to
be
all
right.
You'll
be
all
right.
Drink
this
down,
just
like
medicine.
-

It
was
a
dream,
you're
awake.
Now,
can
you
tell
me?
It
was
the
tower
again
and
the
bell
-
Yes?
Tell
me.
It
was
a
village
square,
a
green
with
trees
and
an
old
whitewashed
Across
the
green
with
a
porch,
shutters
and
a
balcony.
Next
to
it
was
a
livery
stable,
Go
on.
At
the
end
of
the
green
was
a
stone
And
a
wooden
hotel
And
a
saloon?
Dark,
low
ceilings
Yes.
It's
all
there.
It's
no
dream.
You've
been
there
before,
you've
seen
it.
-
No,
never!
there's
an
old
Spanish
mission,
It's
been
preserved
as
it
was
Now
think
hard,
darling.
Think
hard.
You've
been
there,
you've
seen
it.
No,
I've
never
been
there.
Go
on
about
your
dream.
I
stood
alone
on
the
green
Then
I
started
to
walk
to
the
church...
then
the
darkness
closed
in
Being
pulled
into
the
darkness.
You're
going
to
be
You've
given
me
I'll
take
you
to
that
mission
and
you'll
It'll
finish
your
dream,
destroy
it,
All
right?
Come
on,
I'll
take
you
home.
I'll
be
all
right.
You'll
come
back
here
around
noon.
Madeleine?
Where
are
you
now?
-
Here
with
you.
Not
merely
as
it
was
100
years
ago,
or
whenever
it
was
Think
of
when
you
were
here.
There
were
not
so
many
carriages
then.
There
were
horses
in
the
stalls.
A
bay,
two
black
and
a
grey.
It
was
our
favourite
place.
But
we
were
forbidden
to
play
here,
Sister
Teresa
would
scold
us.
Look
at
this.
Here's
your
grey
horse.
Have
a
little
trouble
getting
You
see,
there's
an
answer
Madeleine...
try.
Try
for
me.
-
I
love
you,
Madeleine.
-
Too
late...
It's
too
late.
No,
there's
nothing
you
must
do.
There's
nothing
you
must
do.
No
one
possesses
you,
No,
it's
too
late.
Look,
it's
not
fair,
It
had
to
happen,
we're
in
love.
-
Let
me
go!
-
Do
you
believe
I
love
you?
And
if
you
lose
me,
you'll
know
I
loved
I
won't
lose
you.
-
Let
me
go
into
the
church.
Alone.
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Madeleine!


Mr
Elster,
suspecting
that
all
took
the
preliminary
precaution
lest
any
harm
befall
her.
As
you
have
heard,
Mr
Elster
was
where
her
mental
health
would
have
Mr
Ferguson,
being
an
ex-detective,
would
have
seemed
the
proper
choice
As
you
have
learned,
However,
you'll
agree
no
blame
His
delay
in
putting
his
wife
under
for
information
as
to
her
behaviour,
He
had
taken
every
precaution
he
could
not
have
known
would
make
him
powerless
As
to
Mr
Ferguson.
You
have
heard
his
former
superior,
Detective
Captain
Hansen
testify
as
to
his
character
and
ability
-
The
fact
that
once
before,
Mr
Ferguson
allowed
a
police
colleague
Captain
Hansen
dismissed
Mr
Ferguson
is
to
be
congratulated
upon
when,
in
a
previous
fit
of
aberration,
It
is
a
pity
that,
he
did
not
make
But
we
are
not
here
to
pass
judgment
He
did
nothing.
The
law
has
little
to
say
Nor
does
his
strange
behaviour
have
any
bearing
on
your
verdict.
He
did
not
remain
He
claims
he
suffered
a
blackout
until
he
found
himself
back
You
may
accept
that,
or
not.
Or
you
may
believe
that
having
he
could
not
face
the
tragic
result
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
verdict.
It
is
a
matter
between
him
Now,
from
the
state
of
mind
from
the
manner
of
her
death,
and
from
the
postmortem
you
should
have
no
difficulty
You
may
retire
if
you
wish.
-
We've
reached
a
verdict.
The
jury
finds
that
Madeleine
Elster
while
of
unsound
mind.
The
verdict
will
be
so
recorded.
-
Let's
go.
-
No,
go
ahead.
Sorry,
Scottie,
that
was
rough.
It
was
my
responsibility,
There's
nothing
you
have
to
say
to
me.
I'm
getting
out,
Scottie,
for
good.
I'm
going
to
wind
up
and
get
away
as
far
as
I
can.
Europe,
perhaps.
I
probably
never
will
come
back.
Goodbye,
Scottie.
If
there's
anything
I
can
do
There's
no
way
for
them
to
understand.
You
and
I
know
who
killed
Madeleine.
Come
on,
Scottie,
let's
get
out
of
here.

It's
Mozart.
Wolfgang
Amadeus.
I
had
a
long
talk
with
that
lady
She
says
that
Mozart's
the
boy
for
you.
The
broom
that
sweeps
Well,
it's
what
the
lady
said.
It's
wonderful
how
They
have
music
for
dipsomaniacs
and
music
for
hypochondriacs.
I
wonder
what
would
happen
I
brought
a
lot
of
other
things,
It
shuts
off
automatically.
Oh,
Johnnie.
Johnnie,
please
try.
You're
not
lost.
Mother's
here.


Time?
OK.

I'll
be
in
again,
Johnnie.
Want
me
to
shut
that
off?
Oh,
Johnn-o...
you
don't
even
know
I'm
here,
do
you?
But
I'm
here.
Nurse,
could
I
see
Doctor,
Miss
Wood.
Won't
you
go
in,
please?
Yes,
Miss
Wood?
Doctor,
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
you
It's
hard
to
say.
At
least
six
months,
-
It
really
could
depend
on
him.
No.
He's
suffering
together
with
a
guilt
complex.
He
blames
himself
for
we
know
little
of
what
went
on
before.
I
can
give
you
one
thing.
Oh,
that
does
complicate
the
problem.
I
can
give
you
another
complication
-
You
want
to
know
something,
Doctor?
I
don't
think
Mozart's
gonna
help
at
all.
-
Where
did
you
get
this
car?
I
bought
it
from
a
man
Mr
Gavin
Elster.
I
bought
it
from
him
Oh,
you
knew
him?
And
his
wife?
The
poor
thing
-
I
didn't
know
her.
I'm...
l'm
sorry.
-
Good
evening.
Give
me
a
Scotch
and
soda.

-
Well?
What
is
it?
-
What
for?
Who
are
you?
-
Is
this
some
kind
of
Gallup
poll?
-
Just
a
couple
of
things...
-
I
happened
to
see
you
as
you
came
in.
You've
got
a
nerve!
-
Now,
you
beat
it!
-
Listen,
I'm
gonna
yell
in
a
minute.
Please.
Just
let
me
talk
to
you.
-
What
about?
-
Why?
I
heard
that
one
before
too.
I
remind
you
but
she
ditched
you
for
another
guy
and
you've
been
Then
you
saw
me
-
You're
not
far
wrong.
Please,
let
me
come
in.
You
can
leave
the
door
open,
Well,
I
warn
you
-
I
can
yell
awful
loud.
You
won't
have
to.
Well...
You
don't
look
-
What
do
you
want
to
know?
-
Judy
Barton.
-
I
work
at
Magnin's.
-
It's
a
place
to
live,
that's
all.
-
Yeah,
about
three
years.
Salina,
Kansas.
What
is
this?
What
do
you
want?
-
I
just
want
to
know
who
you
are.
My
name
is
Judy
Barton,
I
work
at
Magnin's
and
I
live
here.
My
gosh,
do
I
have
to
prove
it?
All
right,
mister
-
Judy
Barton,
number
Z296794.
See
the
address
on
this
one?
A
California
licence,
You
wanna
check
my
thumbprints?
And
whether
you're
satisfied
or
not,
Gee,
you
have
got
it
bad,
haven't
you?
Do
I
really
look
like
her?
She's...
She's
dead,
isn't
she?
I'm
sorry.
And
I'm
sorry
I
yelled
at
you.
That's
me
with
my
mother.
And
that's
my
father.
He's
dead.
My
mother
married
again
so
I
decided
I'd
see
what
it's
like
I've
been
here
three
years.
Honest.
-
Will
you
have
dinner
with
me?
-
I
feel
I
owe
you
something
after...
-
Then,
will
you,
for
me?
Just
dinner.
Because
I
remind
you
of
her?
Because
I'd
like
to
have
dinner
with
you.
Well...
I've
been
on
blind
dates
before.
Matter
of
fact,
-
OK.
Oh,
no,
you
better
An
hour?
-
Uh-huh.
'Dearest
Scottie...
'and
so
you've
found
me.
'This
is
the
moment
'wondering
what
I
would
say
and
do
'I
wanted
so
to
see
you
again
just
once.
'Now
I'll
go
and
you
can
'I
want
you
to
have
peace
of
mind,
'I
was
the
tool,
and
you
were
the
victim
'of
Gavin
Elster's
plan
to
murder
his
wife.
'He
chose
me
to
play
the
part
'Lt
was
quite
safe
because
she
lived
in
'Chose
you
to
be
'The
Carlotta
story
'to
make
you
testify
'He
knew
of
your
illness,
he
knew
'He
planned
it
so
well,
'I
made
the
mistake
-
I
fell
in
love.
'That
wasn't
part
of
the
plan.
'I'm
still
in
love
with
you
'Lf
I
had
the
nerve,
I'd
stay
and
lie,
'hoping
I
could
make
you
love
me
again,
'and
so
forget
the
other,
forget
the
past.
'But
I
don't
know
Here,
I'll
do
it.
-
There
you
are.
-
Good
night.
Tomorrow
night?
Well...
No,
I
mean
tomorrow
morning.
-
But
I
have
to
go
to
work,
I've
got
a
job.
What
will
I
live
on,
my
oil
wells
in
Texas?
Let
me
take
care
of
you,
Judy.
Thanks
very
much,
but
no
thanks.
-
You
don't
understand...
I've
been
understanding
since
I
was
17.
-
And
the
next
step
is?
No?
Then
what?
We
could
just...
see
a
lot
of
each
other.
Why?
Because
I
remind
you
of
her?
That's
not
very
complimentary.
And
nothing
else?
No.
That's
not
very
complimentary
either.
I
just
want
to
be
with
you
Well,
I
guess
I...
I
could
phone
the
store
make
some
excuse.

Hi,
John.
I
like
that
one.
-
That?
All
right.
-

There
we
are.
We'll
get
this
-
Honest?
-
How
much
is
that?
-
You
don't
have
to.
No,
that's
not
it.
Nothing
like
it.
But
you
said
grey,
sir.
Look,
I
just
want
an
ordinary,
-
But
I
like
that
one,
Scottie.
The
gentleman
seems
to
know
All
right,
we'll
find
it.
-
What
are
you
doing?
But...
but
I
loved
-
And
this
one,
it's
beautiful.
I
think
I
know
the
suit
you
mean,
We
may
still
have
that
model.
Thank
you.
You're
looking
for
the
suit
that
she
wore.
I
want
you
to
look
nice,
No,
I
won't
do
it!
Judy.
Judy,
it
can't
make
that
much
I
don't
want
any
clothes.
-
Do
this
for
me!
-
Yes,
that's
it.
-
I
don't
like
it.
It
might
need
some
slight
alterations
All
right,
dear.
-
How
long
will
the
alterations
take?
-
By
tonight?
Yes,
it
is.
Short,
black,
with
long
sleeves
-
Scottie...
You
certainly
do
know
All
right,
that's
it.
-
Yes,
we
have.
Here,
Judy.
Drink
this
straight
down,
Why
are
you
doing
this?
I
don't
know.
I
don't
know.
I
wish
you'd
leave
me
alone.
You
can,
you
know.
No,
you
wouldn't
let
me.
And
I...
I
don't
want
to
go.
Judy,
these
past
few
days
have
been
the
I
know.
I
know,
because...
And
not
even
that
very
much.
No.
No,
Judy.
Judy,
it's
you
too.
There's
something
in
you
that...
-
You
don't
even
want
to
touch
me.
Couldn't
you
like
me?
Just
me,
the
way
I
am?
When
we
first
started
out,
And...
And
then
I'll
wear
the
darned
clothes
just
like
me.
-
The
colour
of
your
hair.
Judy,
please,
it
can't
matter
to
you.
Lf...
If
I
let
you
change
me,
will
that
do
it?
If
I
do
what
you
tell
me...
-
will
you
love
me?
Yes.
All
right.
All
right
then,
I'll
do
it.
Come
on
over
and
sit
by
the
fire.
I'm
afraid
it
will
take
several
hours.
The
young
lady
thought
No,
you
tell
her
I'll
go
to
her
hotel
You're
sure
about
the
colour
of
the
hair?
-
Yes,
it's
an
easy
colour.
-
We
know
what
you
want.

Well?
It
should
be
back
from
your
face
We
tried
it,
it
just
didn't
seem
to
suit
me.
Please,
Judy.

-
Where
shall
we
go
for
dinner?
-
Ernie's?
After
all,
it's
our
place.
Hello,
my
love.
Like
me?
-
Mm-hm.
-
Come
here.
That's
what
I
had
in
mind.
Come
here!
It's
too
late,
I
got
my
face
on.
I'm
suddenly
hungry.
-
Would
you
rather
go
somewhere
else?
I'm
gonna
have...
I'm
gonna
have
Let
me
see.
To
start,
I
think
I'll...
Help
me
with
this,
will
you?
I
have
it.
-
How
do
you
work
this
thing?
-
There
you
are.
I'm
just
about
ready.
Where
did
I
put
it?
I
had
it
a
minute
ago.
I
wonder
if
it's
here?
There
it
is.
There,
I'm
ready.
First,
muss
me
a
little?
Scottie,
I
do
have
you
now,
don't
I?
Would
you
like
to
go
someplace
-
We
could
drive
down
the
peninsula.
We're
going
awfully
far.
I
just
feel
like
driving.
Are
you
terribly
hungry?
No.
It's
all
right.
Where
are
you
going?
One
final
thing
I
have
to
do.
And
then
I'll
be
free
of
the
past.
Scottie...
why
are
we
here?
I
told
you.
I
have
to
go
back
into
the
past
For
the
last
time.
Why?
Why
here?
Madeleine
died
here,
Judy.
-
I
don't
want
to
go,
I'd
rather...
Why?
I
need
you
to
be
Madeleine
for
a
while.
And
when
it's
done,
we'll
both
be
free.
-
I'm
scared.
Right
there.
We
stood
there
and
kissed
She
said,
''lf
you
lose
me,
''you'll
know
that
And
I
said,
''I
won't
lose
you.''
But
I
did.
And
then
she
turned...
And
when
I
followed
her,
I
don't
want
to
go
in
there!
It
was
too
late.
Scottie...
I
couldn't
find
her.
She
was
running
up
the
tower.
Right
here.
-
Scottie...
Through
the
trap
door
I
tried
to
follow
her
I
tried
but
I
couldn't
get
to
the
top.
One
doesn't
often
get
a
second
chance.
You're
my
second
chance,
Judy.
-
You're
my
second
chance!
You
look
like
Madeleine
now.
Go
up
the
stairs.
Go
up
the
stairs!
Go
up
the
stairs,
Judy.
And
I'll
follow.
This
was
as
far
as
I
could
get
Remember?
The
necklace,
Madeleine.
That
was
the
slip.
-
Let
me
go!
You
can't!
You're
afraid!
We'll
see.
This
is
my
second
chance!
You
knew
that
day
Who
was
up
there?
Elster
and
his
wife?
-
Yes!
The
real
wife,
not
you!
You
were
the
copy,
the
counterfeit.
-
Was
she
dead
or
alive?
Wasn't
taking
any
chances,
was
he?
When
you
got
there,
he
pushed
her
off.
I
wanted
to
stop
it.
I
ran
up
to
stop
it.
Why
did
you
scream?
You
played
the
wife
very
well.
He
made
you
over,
didn't
he?
Only
better.
but
the
looks,
the
manner
and
the
words
You
jumped
into
the
Bay,
didn't
you?
-
Aren't
you?
And
then
what
did
he
do?
Tell
you
exactly
what
to
do
and
say?
You
were
a
very
apt
pupil
too,
But
why
did
you
pick
on
me?
Why
me?
Your
accident!
My
accident.
I
was
the
setup,
wasn't
I?
I
was
a
made
to
order
witness.
I
was...
I
made
it.
-
I
made
it.
We're
going
up
to
look
Come
on,
Judy!
This
is
where
it
happened.
The
two
of
you
hid
back
there
then
sneaked
down
And
then,
you
were
his
girl,
huh?
Well,
what
happened
to
you?
Did
he
ditch
you?
With
his
wife's
money,
and
he
ditched
you.
What
a
shame.
He
knew
he
was
safe,
-
Did
he
give
you
anything?
And
the
necklace.
Carlotta's
necklace.
There
was
where
you
made
You
shouldn't
keep
You
shouldn't
have
been...
You
shouldn't
have
been
I
loved
you
so,
Madeleine.
Scottie...
I
was
safe
when
you
found
me,
When
I
saw
you
again,
I
walked
into
danger
and
Oh,
Scottie...
Oh,
Scottie,
please.
-
Please!
Please!

Oh,
no!
-

I
heard
voices.
God
have
mercy.
