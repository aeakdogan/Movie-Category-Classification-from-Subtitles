Oh,
hello.
You're,
uh,
you're
probably
here
About
the,
Uh,
the
story.
Elves
love
to
tell
stories.
I-I'll
bet
you
didn't
know
that
There's,
uh,
probably
a
lot
of
things
You...
you
didn't
know
about
elves.
Another...
another
interesting
Uh,
there
are
only
three
jobs
available
The
first
is
making
shoes
at
night
While,
you
know,
while
the
old...
The
old
cobbler
sleeps.
Lazy
bum.
Couldn't
even
make
a
clog.
You
can
bake
cookies
In
a
tree.
Hey!
As
you
can
imagine,
it's,
uh,
dangerous
In
an
oak
tree
during
the
dry
season.

I
wanna
make
shoes!
But
the
third
job...
uh,
some
call
"The
show,"
or...
or
"the
big
dance,"
It's
the
profession
that
every
elf
And
that
is
to
build
toys
in
Only
two
weeks
left
till
Christmas!
I-It's
a
job
only
an
elf
can
do.
Our...
our
nimble
fingers,
Natural
cheer
and
active
minds
Are
perfect
for
toy-building.
They...
they
tried
using
gnomes
But
the
gnomes
drank
too
much...
...and
the
trolls
weren't
toilet
No
human
being
has
ever
set...
set
Uh,
that
is
until
about
30
years
ago,
And,
as
you
may
have
guessed,
That's
where
our
story
begins.
Wow!
Whoa!
Ooh!
Wow!
Wow!

Ow!
Ow!
Whoa!
Are
you
sleepy?
Here
we
are.
We're
just
going
to
make
you
feel
Here
we
are.
There
you
are.
It's
time
to
go
to
sleep.
Maybe
by
next
Christmas
you'll
Merry
Christmas,
my
angel.


Mmm...


All
right,
all
right.
We've
had
another
very
successful

So,
after
all
that
hard
work,
It's
time
to
start
preparations
For
next
Christmas!

What
in
the
name
of
Sam
hill

Wow...

A
baby...

"little
buddy
diapers."
His
name
is
buddy.
He
must've...
Snuck
into
your
sack
at
the
What
do
we
do?

So,
Santa
had
a
And
fortunately,
when
it
Santa's
a...
a
pushover.
So,
buddy
stayed
with,
uh
Who
had
always
wanted
a
child?
But
had
been
so
committed
to
He,
well,
had
forgotten
to
Santa.
Yes,
yes,
I...
I
raised
buddy.
I
was
his
adopted
father.
Though
buddy
grew
twice
as
fast,
He...
he
wasn't
any
different
from
Chuckles
not
too
fast,
buddy.
I
mean,
not...
not
really.
Before
we
learn
how
to
build
In
extreme
graphic
chipset
Let's
recite
the
Shall
we?
Number
one.
"Treat
every
day
like
Christmas."
Number
two.
"There's
room
for
everyone
on
the
Number
three.
"The
best
way
to
spread
Christmas
Is
singing
loud
for
all
to
hear."
And
one
day,
when
buddy
was
I
made
him
my
own
personal
I've
never
been
in
this
room
Well,
I
think
it's
time
you
start
Your
tinker
training.

Santa's
sleigh.
You're
gonna
help
me
make
it
fly.
I
thought
the
magical
reindeer
made
And
where
do
the
reindeer
get
Christmas
spirit.
Everybody
Well,
silly
as
it
sounds,
A
lot
of
people
down
south
Don't
believe
in
Santa
Claus.
What?!
Well,
who
do
they
think
puts
all?
Well,
there's
a
rumor
floating
around
That,
uh,
that
the
parents
do
it.
That's...
that's
ridiculous.
I
mean,
parents
couldn't
do
that
What
about
Santa's
cookies?
I
suppose
parents
eat
them,
too?
Yeah,
I,
uh,
I...
I
know,
Uh,
and
every
earless
and
less
Believe
in
Santa
Claus.
I
mean,
we
have
a
real
energy
Oh.
I
mean,
just
see
how
low
the,
uh
That's
shocking.
That's
why
I
came
up
With
this
little
beauty
in
the
'60s.

WH-what
is
it?
It's
a
cringle
3000...
A
500-reindeer
power
jet
turbine
Without
it,
the
sleigh
couldn't
Get
more
than,
uh,
a
few
feet
off
Well,
it
looks
like
we
got
A
short
in
the
thermo
coupler.
You
wanna
give
mea
hand
with
that?
You
want
me
to
help?
As
much
as,
uh,
buddy
was
accepted
By
his
family
and
friends,
There
were
a
few
drawbacks
To
being,
uh,
a
human
in,
uh

Hey,
Ming
Ming.
Um...
I'm
gonna
be
a
little
bit
short
It's
all
right,
buddy.
Just
how
many
etch-a-sketches
Did
you
get
finished?
Come
on,
buddy.
How
many?
I
made,
uh...
85.
Eighty-five?
That
puts
you...
915
off
the
pace.

Ooh...
that's
bad.
Why
don't
you
just
say
it?
I'm
the
worst
toy
maker
in
I'm
a
cotton-headed
ninny-muggins.

No,
buddy,
you're
not
cotton-
We
all
just
have
different
talents
Seems
like
everyone
else
Have
the
same
talents
You...
you
have,
you
have
lots
of
Special
talents
in
fact,
like
Special
talents?
You
changed
the
batteries
in
the
You
sure
did...
aaa's.
And
in
six
months,
you'll
have
Won't
he?
And
you're
the
only
baritone
in
You
bring
us
down
whole
octave.
In
a
good
way.
See,
buddy?
You're
not
a
cotton-headed
ninny-
You're
just...
special.
And
so,
buddy
was
sent
where
the...

Aah!


Ah!



Hey,
foom
foom...
I
hate
to
do
this
to
you,
but
you
Help
me
pick
up
the
slack
on
those
No
problem.
I
appreciate
it.
Buddy
is
killing
me.
I
already
got
lum
lum
and
choochoo
pulling'
doubles.
That
was
quick
thinking
yesterday
With
that
special
talents
thing.
Ming
Ming:
I
feel
bad
for
the
guy.
I
just
hope
he
doesn't
get
wise.
Well,
if
he
hasn't
figured
out
I
don't
think
he
ever
will.

If
he
hasn't
figured
By
now,
I
don't
think
he
ever
will.
I
think
they're
too
small.

You're
just...
special.




You
don't
look
so
good,
buddy.
Are
you
okay?
I'll
be
okay,
I
just
need
a
glass
Aah!
Buddy...
Unh!
Aah!

Buddy,
are
you
okay?
I'm
sorry,
papa.
I
just
need
some
alone
time.
Buddy,
I...
I
think
we...
we
have
Buddy,
uh,
I
think
there's
something
I...
I
probably
should
tell
you.
You
probably
should
have
found
A
long
time
ago.
I
then
proceeded
to
tell
buddy
of
Had
fallen
in
love
when
he
was
With
a
beautiful
girl
named
And
how
buddy
was
born
And
put
up
for
adoption
by
And
how
she
had
later
passed
away.
I...
I
told
him
his
father
Had
never
even
known
that
And
most
importantly,
I
told
him
where
his
father
was...
Uh,
in
a
magical
land
called
My
dad
works
there?
Empire
state
building.
Hey,
buddy,
wanna
pick
some
Not
now,
arctic
puffin.
Hello,
buddy.
Oh...
hi,
Leon.
Why
the
long
face,
partner?
It
seems
I'm...
I'm
not
an
elf.
'Course
you're
not.
You're
6'3"
And
had
a
beard
since
you
were
15.
Papa
says
my
real
father
Lives
in
a
magical
place
far
away.
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
At
least
you
have
a
daddy.
I
was
just
rolled
up
one
day
and
But
the
thing
is,
I've
never
even
left
Buddy,
I've
been
around
the
world
When
I
was
a
young
cumulus
It's
a
wonderful
place,
filled
with
Except
dogs.
Oh,
by
the
way,
don't
eat
the
Oh,
I
know
that.
All
I'm
say
in'
is,
this
might
be
To
find
out
whom
you
really
are.
So,
I
hear
you're
going
On
a
little
journey
to
Yup.
Ahh.
I'm
kind
a
nervous.

Leon
says
New
York
is
pretty
Oh,
don't
pay
attention
to
Leon.
He's
never
been
anywhere.
I've
been
to
New
York

Really?
Mm-hmm.
What's
it
like?
Well,

things

First

But

son
11th.
And

you
see
a
sign
that
That
doesn't
mean
that
Look

presents
before
Christmas.
Can't
wait
to
see
my
dad...
We're
gonna
go

skating
and...

the
other
thing
I

to
talk
to
you
about.
You

Your
father...
Well...

the
naughty

That

the
payments.
But

children
love
the
books.
I

But
I

hearing
that.
Listen,
some
people,

Of
what's
important
in
life.
That
doesn't
mean
they
can't
find
Maybe
all
they
need
Is
just
a
little
Christmas
spirit.

Well,

Buddy.
I'm
Carolyn.
Hi.
What
do
you
want
for
Christmas?
A
Suzy-talks-a-lot.
I'll
put
in
a
good
word
with
Thanks.
Your
costume
is
pretty.
Oh,
it's
not
a
costume.
Well,
technically,
I'm
a
human,
But
I
was
raised
by
elves.
Oh,
I'm
a
human
raised
by
humans.
Hmm.
Cool.

So?
It's
a
boy...
buddy's
your
son.
That's
very
impossible.
You...
you
saw
that
guy
out
there.
He's...
he's
certifiably
insane.
He's
probably
just
reverting
To
a
state
of
childlike
An
elf?
What
he
needs
is
to
be
nurtured.
Oh,
I
see.
So,
um,
uh...
You'd
like
me
to
breastfeed
him?
Walter,
just
bring
him
home.
Introduce
him
to
Emily
and
And
once...
once
he
comes
to
He
should
drop
the
whole
elf
I
mean,
that's
what
I
would
do
if
Oh,
my
god!
Walter,
this
is...
This
is
wonderful,
You...
you
have
another
son.
Wonderful.
Oh,
gosh,
I...
I
guess
I
never
really
thought
This
is
incredible,
I...
You
know,
it's
a
little
But
it's
nothing
that
we
can't
Honey?
What?
He
thinks
he's
an
elf.
I'm
sorry,
what?
He
think
she's
a
Christmas
elf.
Oh,
come
on,
Walter,
I'm
sure
he
doesn't
actually
And
then,
I
traveled
through
Of
the
candy
cane
forest,
Past
the
sea
of

And
then,
I
walked
through

try
to
stick
to
the
Candy,
candy
canes,
candy
corns,
So,

you
be
staying
with
us?
You
mean
I
can
stay?
Of
course
you
can.
Emily.
How...
how
long
do
you
think
I...
I
hadn't
really
planned
But
I
was
thinking,
like...
Emily?
Can
I
just
speak
to
you
in
the,
uh,
kitchen,
please?
Are
you
crazy?
He
cannot
Clearly
he
has
some
serious
issues.
We
can't
just
throw
him
out
in
Why
not?
He
loves
the
snow.
He's
told
me
15
times.
Walter,
he's
your
son.

Did
you
hear
that?
You
are
so
weird.
Dad?
Dad?

40
minutes.
And
I
had
time
to
build

So,

angels
And
then
we'll
go

skating
Of
tollhouse
cookie
dough

And
then,
to
finish,
we'll
snuggle.
I've
got
to
go
to
work,
buddy.
Oh,
and
another
thing...
If
you're
going
to
be
staying
You
should
think
about,
you
know,
Getting
rid
of
the

But
I've
worn
this
my
whole
life.
You're
not
in
the
North
Pole

As
soon
as
possible.
Okay.

almost
forgot...

How'd

emergency?
There's

horrible
noise
Coming

some
tough
times
down
With,
you

a
rabbit,

Kids,
they're
already
vulnerable.
No,
you
see?
I...
I
told
you
guys.

you
know,
If
you've
got
a
story
here...
I've
got
about
five
or
six
great
I've
got
one
idea
that
Psyched
out
of
my
mind

know,
it's
one
of
those
ideas
Where
you're
just
like,
uh...

But,
baby,
it's
cold
outside

roar
So,

don't
hurry
Well,
maybe
just
a

a

more
Put
some
records
on
while
I
pour
The
neighbors
might
think
Baby,
it's
bad
out
there
Say,
what's
in
this
drink?
No
cabs
to
be
had
out
there
I
wish
I
knew
how
Your
eyes
are
like
starlight
now
To
break
the
spell
I'll
take
your
hat,
your
hair
I
ought
to
say
no,
no,
no,
sir
Mind
if
I
move
in
closer?
At

I'm
gonna
say
that

the
sense
of
hurting

I
simply
must
go

it's
cold
outside
The
answer
is
no

welcome
has
been

lucky
that

dropped
in
So
nice

more
Never
such
a
pleasure
before
I've
got
to
get
home
But,
baby,
you'll
freeze
out
there
Say,
lend
me
your
comb
It's
up
to
your
knees
out
there
You've
really
been
grand
I
thrill
when
you
touch
my
hand
But
don't
you
see
How
can
you
do
this
thing
to
me?
There's
bound
to
be

of
my
lifelong
sorrow
At

there
will
be
plenty
If
you
caught
pneumonia
and
died
I
really
can't
stay
Get
rid
of
that
hold
out
Ah,
but
it's
cold
Outside
