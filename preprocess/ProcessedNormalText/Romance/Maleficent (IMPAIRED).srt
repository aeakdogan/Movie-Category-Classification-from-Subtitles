NARRATOR:
Let
us
tell
and
we
will
see
how
well
you
know
it.
Once
upon
a
time,
that
were
the
worst
of
neighbours.
So
vast
was
the
discord
between
them
that
it
was
said
only
a
great
hero
or
a
terrible
villain
In
one
kingdom
with
a
vain
and
greedy
king
They
were
forever
discontent,
and
envious
of
the
wealth
For
in
the
other
kingdom,
the
Moors,
lived
every
manner
of
strange
And
they
needed
but
trusted
in
one
another.
In
a
great
tree
lived
one
such
spirit.
You
might
take
her
for
a
girl,
but
she
was
not
just
any
girl.
She
was
a
fairy.

There
you
go.
And
her
name
was
Maleficent.
Good
morning,
Mr
Chanterelle!
-
I
love
your
cap!
No.
No,
don't
do
it!
-
Ahh!

Ha!
You
missed
me!
-
Good
morning.
Lovely
work,
girls!
Whoo-hoo!

What's
all
the
fuss
about?
Why
do
you
get
to
tell
her?
THISTLEWIT:
I
want
to!
There
are
rules,
Flittle.
I
tell
this
time,
you
tell
next
time.
FLITTLE:
No,
you
told
last
time,
so
I
should
tell
this
time,
Tell
me
what?
Fine!
Thank
you.
Maleficent,
the
border
guard...
The
border
guards
have
found
a
human
thief
at
the
pool
of
jewels.
I'm
sorry.

She's
always
in
a
hurry,
Humans,
here.
I
hope
there's
not
another
war.

I'm
not
afraid.
Besides,
I
have
never
Come
out!
BOY:
No.
They
mean
to
kill
me.
And
besides,
they're
hideous
to
look
at.

That's
extremely
rude.
Don't
listen
to
him,
Balthazar.
You're
classically
handsome.

It's
not
right
to
steal,
but
we
don't
kill
people
for
it.
Come
out.
Come
out
this
instant!
Are
you
fully
grown?
No.
I
believe
he's
just
a
boy.
And
you're
just
a
girl.
I
think.
Who
are
you?
I'm
called
Stefan.
Who
are
you?
I'm
Maleficent.

Yes,
right.
You
have
to
give
it
back.
Give
what
back?


If
I
knew
you
would
throw
it
away,
I
would
have
kept
it.
I
didn't
throw
it
away.
I
delivered
it
home,
Someday,
you
know,
I'll
live
there.
In
the
castle.
Where
do
you
live
now?
In
a
barn.
So
your
parents
are
farmers,
then?
My
parents
are
dead.
Mine,
too.
We'll
see
each
other
again.
You
really
shouldn't
It's
not
safe.
And
if
I
made
that
choice,
if
I
came
back,
would
you
be
here?
Perhaps.
-
Ow!
Your
ring.
Iron
burns
fairies.
I'm
sorry.
I
like
your
wings.
NARRATOR:
Maleficent
thought
of
he
who
had
so
little
in
the
world,
so
that
their
hands
might
touch
again,
and
her
heart
was
moved.
Thus
did
the
young
thief
who
had
hoped
to
steal
a
jewel...
STEFAN:
Maleficent!
...steal
something
far
more
precious.
STEFAN:
Maleficent?
Maleficent!
After
all
these
weeks,
look
who
came
back.
I
thought
it
worth
the
risk.
So,
what
do
you
do
for
fun?

Whoa!

NARRATOR:
Stefan
and
Maleficent
And
for
a
time
it
seemed
as
if,
in
them
at
least,
the
old
hatred
between
men
and
fairies
As
it
will,
friendship
slowly
And
on
her
16th
birthday,
Stefan
gave
Maleficent
a
gift.
He
told
her
it
was
true
love's
kiss.
But
it
was
not
to
be.
As
the
years
passed,
Stefan's
ambition
and
towards
the
temptations
While
Maleficent,
rose
to
become
Maleficent
often
wandered
alone
and
sometimes
wondered
for
she
had
never
understood
But
she
was
to
learn.
For
the
human
king
had
heard
and
he
sought
to
strike
it
down.
SOLDIER:
Guard,
halt!
Guard,
halt!
There
they
are,
the
mysterious
Moors

of

Well,
I
say
crush

Go
no
further!
A

does
not
take

from

You
are
no

HENRY:
When
I
ascended
to

I
promised
the

one
day
we
would
take
the

and
its

Each

to

Your

Is
this

It

I

They

What

What

Royalty,
nobility,

How
quaint.
Even

I
must
say
I
really
felt
quite
distressed
You're
not
welcome

Oh.

Oh,
dear.
What
an
awkward
situation.
You're
not
offended?
Why,
no.
And
to
show
I

King
Stefan

The

were
broken
and
burned,
that
they
might

he
entrusted

Stefan
shut
himself
behind
while
his
soldiers
rode
far
and
wide
to
hunt
Maleficent
down.
But
she
made
walls
of
her
own,
that
the
Moors
might

any

And
she
revelled
in
the
sorrow
that
her

had
brought.

no!
Is

Looks
dreadful.
Come

Oh,

Ooh!

Or
bigger

No,
what
we
need
is
a
proper

What
do
you
mean?
Well,
we
have
to
blend
in,
don't
we?
We
have
to
be
big
enough
So,
gather
around,
ladies.

Get
ready.
One,
two,
three,
grow!


Oh,
that's
worked
quite
well.
Now,
there
will

We

No

No

are.
There
you

It

that!

did

Far
away
from

palace
that
she
remembered
not.

And
as
the
seasons
changed
so
did
she.

Hello.
That's

There
you
go.

wondered
at
the
world
about

at
what
lay
beyond

Hmm.

But
she
was
not

Look.
Is
that

Is
that

Whoa!

Hmm.

How
could
you
do
that
to

said
anything
I
need.
Yeah,
but
not
a
dog.
It
was

not
a
dog.

same

dirty,
vicious,

Next
time
I'll

into

stinking...

wonder.
Wow.

Don't
be
afraid.

I
am
not
afraid.
Then
come
out.
Then
you'll
be
afraid.
No,
I
won't.

know
who
you
are.
Do

What

will.

No.

to
say
goodbye.

I'm
sorry
to
bother
you,
but
I'm
on
my

King
Stefan's

I've
become
hopelessly
lost.

help
me?
Oh,

meeting
you.
And

You're
forgiven.
That's
good.
I'd

then.
Good

Will
you
be

No,

be
how
you
feel,
but
what
about
Aurora?

That
boy
could
be
her
only
chance.
It's
her
fate,
anyway.
Go
ahead.
Turn
me
into
whatever
you
want.
A
bird,
a
worm.
I
don't
care
any
more.
I'm
so
happy
we're
leaving
tomorrow.
We
are
not
leaving
tomorrow.
Tomorrow
is
Aurora's
16th
birthday.
KNOTGRASS:
And
Stefan
the
day
after
her
birthday.
No.
He
said
on
her
birthday.
KNOTGRASS:
No.
-
On.
-
On.
-
On,
on,
on!
Oh,
stop
it!

Oh!

What?

How
could
you?

I
need
to
talk
to
you
about
something.
Oh,
yes,
sweetie,
what
is
it?

I'm
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
this,
but
I'll
be
16
tomorrow.
Oh.
Oh,
yes.
I'm
leaving
home.
See
here,
young
lady.
I
did
not
spend
16
years
with
these
two
imbeciles...
Shush!
So
that
you
could
We
are
taking
you
back
My
father?
You
told
me
my
parents
were
dead.
I
think
you
better
come
and
sit
down.
Fairy
Godmother!
I'm
here.
When
were
you
going
to
Is
it
true?
It
is.
My
aunts
said
it
was
an
evil
fairy.
I...
I
can't
remember
her
name.
They
said
it
was...
Maleficent.
Is
that
you?
Are
you
Maleficent?
No!
Don't
touch
me.
You're
the
evil
that's
in
the
world.
It's
you!

Find
the
boy!

STEFAN:
I
need
every
available
man
There
should
be
no
guards
at
the
gate.
I
want
her
to
walk
right
in.
GUARD:
Sorry
to
disturb,
Your
Majesty.
We
found
this
urchin
at
the
gate.
She
claims
to
be
the
princess.
Father.
It's
me,
Aurora!
You
look
just
like
your
mother.
They
brought
you
back
a
day
too
soon.
I
told
those
three
idiots!
Lock
her
up
in
her
room.
Go.
Prepare
the
men.
Maleficent's
coming.
FLITTLE:
It's
so
good
to
be
small
again!
Look
at
my
feet!
I
love
my
tiny
little
feet!
Pay
attention!
We
have
to
find
Aurora,
or
the
king
will
have
our
heads!

WHISPERING
VOICES:
Aurora.

Wait!
Princess?

I'm
looking
for
a
girl.
Of
course
you
are.
I
need
a
horse.

WHISPERING
VOICES:
...into
a
sleep
like
death.
Aurora.
Come
on,
Diaval!

WHISPERING
VOICES:
Aurora.
Faster,
Diaval,
faster!
WHISPERING
VOICES:
She
will
prick
her
finger
on
the
spindle
of
a
spinning
wheel
and
fall
into
a
sleep
like
death.
No
power
on
Earth...
A
sleep
like
death.

It's
done.

DIAVAL:
They
pulled
the
guards.
He's
waiting
for
you
in
there.
If
we
go
inside
those
walls,
Then
don't
come.
It's
not
your
fight.
Huh.
Thank
you
very
much.
"I
need
you,
Diaval."
"I
can't
do
this
without
you,
Diaval."
MALEFICENT:
I
can
hear
you.
Look
at
her.
Look
at
what
you've
done.
She's
only
sleeping.
She's
only
sleeping,
you
say?
She's
only
sleeping.
She's
only
sleeping
forever!
-
What
about
the
kiss?
True
love
does
not
exist.
But
it's
her
only
chance,
Your
Majesty.



DIAVAL:
Mistress.



Hmm.
What
are
we
going
to
do?
We
can't
give
up,
can
we?
But
we
don't
even
know
where
to
start.
True
love
doesn't
just
fall


PHILIP:
Pardon
me.
I'm
embarrassed
to
say
In
King
Stefan's
castle.
This
is
where
I'm
meant
to
be.
Odd
that
I
can't
recall
how
I
got
here.
Why
have
you
come?
My
father
sent
me
to
see
the
King.
KNOTGRASS:
Who
is
your
father?
King
John
of
Ulstead.
ALL:
A
prince!

Aurora.
THISTLEWIT:
He
knows
her.
Why
is
she
sleeping?
She's
trapped
in
an
enchantment.
Isn't
she
beautiful?
The
most
beautiful
girl
I've
ever
seen.
Do
you
want
to
kiss
her?
Very
much.
KNOTGRASS:
Go
on,
then.
PHILIP:
I
wouldn't
feel
right
about
it.
I
barely
know
her.
We've
only
met
once.
FLITTLE:
Haven't
you
ever
Kiss
her!
Go
on.
An
enchantment,
you
say?
ALL:
Oh!
Kiss
her!
You
didn't
do
it
properly!
It's
supposed
to
be
true
love's
kiss!
I
was
certain
he
was
the
one.
What
are
you
doing?
KNOTGRASS:
We
have
to
keep
looking.
I
told
you.
I
will
not
ask
your
forgiveness
because
what
I
have
I
was
so
lost
in
hatred
and
revenge.
Sweet
Aurora,
you
stole
what
was
left
of
my
heart.
And
now
I
have
lost
you
forever.
I
swear,
no
harm
will
come
to
you
as
long
as
I
live.
And
not
a
day
shall
pass
that
I
don't
miss
your
smile.

Hello,
Godmother.
Hello,
beasty.
No
truer
love.
She's
here,
sire.
Are
we
going
back
to
the
Moors
now?
If
that
is
what
you
wish.


GUARD:
We've
got
her!

-
Stop!





No!

Into
a
dragon.




SOLDIER:
To
the
other
side.

MALEFICENT:
Run,
Aurora!


SOLDIER
1:
Get
back!
Hold
it
steady!
Pull
to
the
left!
Pull!
Hold
the
line!

Look
out.
Hold
your
line.

Hmm!
Enough!
How
does
it
feel,
hmm?
To
be
a
fairy
creature
without
wings
in
a

you
don't
belong?




Kill

Kill

Ahh!

NARRATOR:
Maleficent
brought
and
took
off
her
crown.
And
she
invited
Aurora
to
see
long
ago,
when
Maleficent
and
her
heart
was
bright.
For
now,
it
was
again.
But
that
was
not
all.
KNOTGRASS:
Oh,
there
she
is.
Wait
for
me!
KNOTGRASS:
We

for
whom
we
have
sacrificed
Never

Our
kingdoms
have
been
unified.
You
have
your
queen.

So
you
see,
and
I
should
know,
for
I
was

In
the
end,
my
kingdom

a
villain,

had
predicted,

I

That
look
