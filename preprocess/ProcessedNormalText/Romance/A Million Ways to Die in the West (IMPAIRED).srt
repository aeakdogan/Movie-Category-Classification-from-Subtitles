NARRATOR:
Some
people
are
born
This
was
the
American
A
hard
land
for
hard
folk.
Food
was
scarce,
disease
was
rampant,
and
life
was
a
daily
Hell,
this
was
Miss
Holy
shit.
To
build
a
home
and
a
life
in
required
that
a
man
be
bold,
The
men
who
were
were
the
men
who
prospered.
But
some
men
were
just

Well,
well.
Surprised
you
showed
up,
Stark.
Yeah,
well,
you
said
you
and
burn
my
house
down
Draw.

Is
there
anything
at
to
get
you
to
call
this
off?
You
yellow,
Stark?
Oh,
okay,
well,
that's
a
little
over
here
from
the
Far
Draw,
you
son
of
a
bitch!
Look,
I
just
feel
like
if
we
we
can
find
a
calm,
and
maybe
we
even
laugh
I
ain't
in
the
mood
Look,
there's
always
Oh,
hey,
look.
This
will
make
It
looks
like
our
shadows
are
Look
at
that.
Oh,
wait,
watch
this.
Oh,
Thank
you!
This
is

Oh,
wow!
This
is...
-
What
a
terrific
guy
you
are.
We
barely
know
each
other,
but,
hey,
I'll
give
you
a
little
tap
on
the
Look,
we're
laughing,
right?
What
were
we
even
fighting
about?
I
can't
remember.
Can
you?

Your
goddamn
sheep
grazed
That
grass
ain't
never
All
right,
look.
How
about
this?
I'll
pay
you
the
money
Just
give
me
two
days
to
sell
off
a
few
of
my
sheep
and
All
right.
Just
two
days.
If
I
don't
have
that
cash,
Okay,
great.
Thank
you
so
I
really
appreciate
it.
And
what
a
relief
for
who
came
out
here
find
an
amicable
Aw,
somebody
shoot
some
fucker!
I
took
a
half-day
Okay,
I
just
want
to
point
out
that
guy's
an
English


Just
a
little
taste.

ALBERT:
I
mean,
that
should
I
mean,
I
tell
him
we
go
our
separate
But,
no,
he
shoots
me
I
mean,
it's
just
a
graze,

What?
You
should
have
fought
him.
I
should
have
fought
him?
You're
serious.
Louise!
My
God!
The
guy
is
one
-
I
look
like
I
have
Parkinson's
next
to
him.
It's
just
another
way
God
But,
look,
it
would
have
been
Albert,
I'm
breaking
up
with
you.
What?
Yeah.
I'm
sorry.
I
got
shot
today.
I
know.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Hang
on
a
sec.
Louise,
where
is
this
coming
from?
Is
this
because
of
the
gunfight?
No,
I've
actually
been
feeling
You're
a
great
guy.
I
just...
I
realized
that
I
want
something
else.
Something
else?
Louise,
it's
Look,
I
know
I'm
just
a
sheep
Yeah,
but
you're
not
even
a
Your
sheep
are
everywhere.
The
one
thing
a
sheep
is
keep
all
of
his
sheep
I
went
to
your
farm
the
other
day,
and
I
saw
one
in
the
backyard,
three
way
up
on
the
ridge,
two
in
the
pond,
and
Okay,
that's
Bridget,
all
right?
She
has
a
problem
with
retardation,
Look,
we're
getting
off
Why
don't
you
just
tell
and
then
maybe
I
can
fix
it?
Maybe
if
I
were
older,
the
timing
would
be
right.
But
people
are
living
and
a
girl
doesn't
and
get
married
right
away.
I
just,
I
have
to...
I
have
to
work
on
myself.
Oh,
my
God.
-
You
did
not
just
say
that.
"I
have
to
work
on
myself."
Louise,
that's
the
You
realize
that.
You
know
what,
it's
okay,
though.
It's
all
right.
I
know
It's
because
you
don't
want
to

Goodbye,
Albert.
Goodbye?
Wait.
Louise.
Louise!
I
love
you.
I'm
sorry.

So,

You

ALBERT:
Oh,

For

Fair
enough.
EDWARD:
Albert.

dance.
I

Louise
has
such
an
amazing
smile.
-
That'd
be
weird.
Have
you
ever
smiled
-
No,
have
you?
No,
you'd
look
like
But,
it's
just,
you
know,
trying
to
figure
out
how
the
hell
I
could
have
screwed
this
up.
I
did
everything
for
her.
If
she
was
happy,
I
was
happy.
That's
all
I
cared
about.

And
she
was
the
one
and
the
diseases,
and
the
wild
and
the
general
depressing
bearable.

God,
I
love
her
so
much.
You're
gonna
make
me
cry.

Let's
get
fucked
up.


So,
what
are
you
gonna
do?
Uh...
I
don't
know
what
I'm
gonna
do.
Commit
suicide,
maybe.
Albert,
I
know
everything
but

promise
you,
there's
Really?

And

it
so
big?
So
it
doesn't
melt.
EDWARD:
Oh.
That's
so
neat.
I
know.
It's
actually
really
It's
this
one
company
out
in
Boston
that
basically
cuts
from
frozen
lakes
and
ponds,
BOTH:
Oh!
Oh...
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
That
went
south
so
fast!
Oh!
Oh!
WILSON:
There
shall
be
swift
and
righteous
No
more
shall
they
nibble
wantonly
at
the
teat
of
our
coffers.
And
that's
just
exactly
that
applies
to
that
situation.
I
would
also
like
to
to
the
family
of
James
Addison,
who
was
killed
this
morning
while
unloading
the
ice
shipment.
James,
we
will
think
of
as
we
sip
the
cold
summer
beverages
for
which
you
gave
your
life.

They're
still
Now,
before
we
end
this
I
would
like
to
welcome
two
Lewis
Barnes
and
his
sister,
Anna.
They've
just
moved
and
they
plan
to
build
a
farm.
And
we
wish
them
all
the
luck.
Well,
that
concludes
So,
may
God
bless
you
and
there
is
a
mountain

Hi.
Hey,
you.
-
So,
the
fair's
coming
up...
and
I
was
thinking
that
we
I
was
thinking
you

Something
expensive?
Stupidly
expensive!
Okay.

Oh,
Jesus.
Wow.
Hi,
Albert.
Hello.
What's
up,
kiddo?
Never
Just
browsing.
Yeah.
You
don't
have
a
moustache,
though.
No,
I
know.
I
was
thinking
I'm
sorry,
I
can't...
-
I
said
I
was
thinking
about
growing
one.
Excuse
me,
I
have
to
And
just
what
kind
of
moustache
Um,
a
big
one.
Like
one
of
those
along
the
side
of
my
mouth,
and
then
goes
up
the
and
then
becomes
my
sideburns,
and
then
becomes
my
hair.
A
MÃ¶bius
moustache.
MÃ¶bius
moustache,
that's
the
one.
Yeah.
Um...
You
should
know
that
is
a
very
costly
facial
accessory.
Yeah,
I
know
that.
Well,
you're
a
sheep
farmer.

Let
me
ask
you
something.
You
feel
What
exactly
am
I
doing?
Stealing
a
guy's
girlfriend.
You
feel
good
about
that?
Hey,
Louise
dumped
you,
my
friend.
It's
not
my
fault
she
wanted
I
can
give
her
a
lavish
home.
Warm
blankets,
wrapped
candies.
Can
you
say
the
same,
Albert?
Can
you
give
Louise
You
know
what?
Fuck
you,
man.
Yeah,
that's
what
she's
doing.


Oh,
hey,
sweetie.
Hi!
-
Hi,
Mark.
Wow!
What
a
long
day!
Oh,
what
happened?
Oh,
gosh!
Well,
like,
this
one
and
then
ash
on
his
balls
and
I'm
like,
"What?

Yeah.
You
know,
uh,
Ruth,
About
what?
Well,
I
love
you.
Well,
I
love
you,
too.
And
we've
been
together
Wh...
What
do
you
think
about
us
You
mean
having
sex?
Maybe
not
right
away,
you
know?
We
could
maybe
lie
together
and
see
how
it
feels,
But,
Eddie,
we're
Christians.
I
know
we're
Christians
and
I
want
to
do
the
correct
But
if
we
really
do
don't
you
think
God
I
don't
know.
I
mean,
you're
talking
about
Oh!
You've
got
a
little
thing
Oops.
Oopsie.
-
Thank
you.
That's
it,
I'm
out.
What?
I'm
done.
I'm
leaving.
What,
are
you
serious?
Yes,
I'm
serious.
And,
yes,
I
don't
know
how
I
I
hate
the
frontier,
Well,
what
am
I
gonna
do?
I
know.
That's...
That's
why
Albert,
these
are
Yeah.
And
I
want
you
to
have
that.
Edward,
this
is
your
Yeah.
It's
sticky.
Well,
hello
to
you,
too!
James,
I
found
the
friendly
locals.
So
he
said,
"Why
don't
you

Hey,
watch
it,
pal.
I
think
you
owe
me
a
drink,
fella.
The
hell
I
do.
You
best
watch
where
you
stand.
I
don't
think
you
heard
me.
I'm
thirsty.
Then
why
don't
you
go
on
down
Last
chance,
kid.




Oh,
shit!

Albert,
hurry!
Get
in
position!


We
got
our
own
thing
Yeah,
nobody
needs
We're
both
getting


Nobody
needs
to
come
over
here.
This
fight
is
way
more
All
those
other
guys'
fights.


-

You
actually
hit
me!
I'm
so
sorry.
You
fucker!
I
put
a
new
move
in
there.
You
don't
just
put
a
new
move
in.
That's
why
we
have
the
meetings.

That's
where
it
hurts.
Like,
right
underneath
my
eye.
Yeah,
there's
a
little
red
spot.
Ow!
Careful,
it's
tender.

-
Thank
you.

Shit.
Come
on.
Whoa!

Sorry
about
that.
It's
kind
of
a
regular
-
Really?

Hey,
pretty
fast
hands
back
there.
-
Oh...
Me?
No,
I'm
not
the
hero.
I'm
the
guy
in
the
crowd
making
-
That's
who
I
am.
-
Hey,
look
who's
here.
This
is
Plugger.
Hey,
Plugger.
So,
that...
That
was
your
Yeah,
Lewis.
He's
always
Yeah,
he
seems
like
a
great
guy.
Anna.
You
guys
just
got
into
town?
Yeah.
Welcome
to
our
awesome
town.
Thanks.
Lewis
and
I
just
came
Oh,
Kansas.
No,
it's
in
Missouri.
Oh,
right.
That's
We
were
wanting
a
change,
so
we
came
out
to
the
frontier
-
Oh,
that's
what
I
do.
Yeah,
I
got
a
farm
about
Oh,
cattle?
Uh,
no,
sheep.
-
Oh.
Well,
that's
got
to
be
Ah,
yeah,
it's
great.
It's
like
being
a
dog
walker

-
ALBERT:
Oh,
shit,
Plugger!
-
Plugger,
give
it
to
me.

It's
the
mayor.
-

Oh,
shit!
So,
how
did
you
guys
meet?
Uh,
she
moved
to
town
to
take
over
the
schoolmarm
job.
Our
old
schoolmarm
got
her
throat
-
Oh,
my
God!
In
front
of
the
kids?
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
All
of
them.
ANNA:
Let
me
help
you.
That
is
just
painful
to
watch.
And,
you
know,
it's
like
the
I
just
remember
thinking,
"How
can
I
possibly
be
this
happy?
"She
likes
me
now,
"but
one
day,
she
"that
she
is
too
good
for
me."
And
then
one
day,
she
did.
I
feel
like
I
finally
tricked
one
and
then
I
lost
her.
I
think
you
have
this
I
mean,
it
sounds
like
you've
bent
but
what
has
she
given
you
back?
I
told
you,
she
allowed
in
a
part
of
the
world
that
"Allowed"?
Wow.
That's
kind
of
fucked
up
that
You
know
that,
right?
All
I
know
is
that
there
if
I
don't
have
her.
ANNA:
Well,
if
this
Foy
guy
is
she'll
figure
it
out
Sometimes
a
girl
has
to
get
a
before
she
realizes
what
Mmm.
Maybe.

-
Ah!

This
is
actually

Oh,
my
God.

-
Oh,
shit.
-
It's
a
diamondback,
yeah.
It's
okay,
just
hold
perfectly
Okay,
okay.
I
don't
think
you
At
least
stay
through
the
weekend.
Isn't
the
fair
on
Saturday?
Oh,
fuck
that.
I'm
not
Louise
is
gonna
be
there,
I
don't
want
to
put
myself
through
that
kind
of
fucking
aggravation.
Yeah,
well,
I'll
go
with
you.
No
better
way
to
make
your
than
to
let
her
see
you
I
don't
know.
Especially
a
smoking-hot
girl.
When
she
sees
me,
she'll
Oh,
you're
very
modest,
I
see.
I'm
a
little
cocky.
-

-
Oh!
Sorry,
sir.
Sorry,
sir.


Barnes,

up.
You
stupid
son
of
a
bitch.
You
shot
the
pastor's
son.
You
realize
they're
probably
Who
gives
a
fuck
what
they
want?
When
Clinch
gets
into
town,
it's
He'll
bust
me
out
and
anyone
who
tries
to
stop
You
know,
one
of
these
days
there's
gonna
be
a
man
and
tougher,
and
stronger.
And
then
Clinch
is
And
I'm
gonna
smoke

don't
think
Clinch

is
a
greeting.
You,
why
are
you
laughing?
I

He

laughing.
It
seems
your
ex-boyfriend
I

Albert,

Why?
She

impressed.
You

a
fire
in
your
belly
Bet
you

showed
Yeah,
I
don't
have
that
side
to
me.
I
honestly
don't
know
Albert,
you
got
her
attention.
You
beat
this
guy
at
a
gunfight,
I
bet
she
thinks
twice
Anna,
I
can't
be
in
a
gunfight.
What
am
I,
Clinch
Leatherwood
here?
-
I'll
get
killed!
Why
would
you
say
that?
Because
he's
the
most
vicious
which
I
am
not!
No,

not
Clinch
Leatherwood.
You're

to
my
stomach.
You're
worked
up,

Come

Hey!
It's
our
sweet
young
couple.
Could
I
interest
you
folks

People

at
the
fair.
People
die
at
the
fair.
ANNA:
Okay,
so
you're
gonna
put
it
all
the
way
to
the
left.
Cross
it
over,
cradle
and
then
just
extend
it
-
Like
that?
Wow,
you've
never
I...
I
have
not.
I
own
a
gun.
No,

loads.
Okay,

ready.
I'm
about

All
right.
Okay.

This

This

It's
gonna
work

Louise

How

sitting
there

guess.
I

I
just...
I
just
Well,
can
I
ask
you
Yeah,

Why
do
you
love
Louise?

I
feel
great
when
I'm
with
her.
She's
classy,
she's
fun,
Hey,
no.
Look,
she's
But
honestly,

I
don't

what
else
My
impression
was
that
she
was
a
And
for
a
guy
with
so
I
just
thought
that
maybe
you...
I
don't
know
what
you
think
You
see?
There
you
go
again,
just
cutting
yourself
down.
You
act
like
this
some
kind
of
a
charitable
Albert,
you're
a
catch.
You're
sweet,
you're
You've
made
something
You

You're

sheep
farmer.

Really?
Wandered
in

then
somehow,
it
had
made
$20.

But,

you
Oh,
look,
the
West
fucking
sucks,
but
the
frontier
is
It's
you.
You
need
a
little
confidence
Now,
aim
up,
sheep
boy.
-
Oh!
-
There
we
go!
All
righty.
That's
one.
So,
all
I
gotta
do
is
get
Foy
to
let
and
then
I
win!
You're
gonna
do
great,
I
promise.
-
Easy.

-

Hey!

Oh!
God
damn
it,
Albert!
ANNA:
So
much
better
than
last
week.
And
I
have
a
surprise
for
you.
You
have
earned
one
of
Anna
Barnes'
very
special
Mmm-hmm.
-
Wait,
what
is
this?
This
is
a
pot...
This
is
-
It's
a
pot
cookie.
No.
I
don't
do
well
It's
a
pot
cookie.
Yeah,
I
know.
No,
thank
you.
Just
have
a
little
bit
with
me.
My
worst
fear
is
to
OD
-

No,
thank
you.
The
last
time
somebody
I
became
convinced
that
prairie
Just
take
a
little
bit.
-
I'll
take
a
very,
very
small
bite.
-
A
very
small
bite.
Are
you
kidding
me?
Nope.
Deadly
serious.
-

and
if
I
don't
throw
during
some
awful
Just
take
that
little
-
Well,
now
you've
touched
it.
Take
the
other
side.
There
you
go.
There.
And
now,
we
just
wait
This
is
really
weird.
-
Is
it
supposed
to
be
like
this?
You
gave
me
the
right
You
don't
think
I
took
too
much?
-
Just
ride
it
out.
Wow,
my
bones
are
in
Like,
there's
a
lot
more
I
think
my
body
is
padding
which
is
weird,
because
But
there's
a
lot
more
there.

Oh...

There's
something
wrong
This
is
not
how
I
usually
swallow.

Oh,
my
God,
Anna,
he
knows.
What,
what,
what?
He
knows
what
we're
doing,
He
knows
what
this
is.
I
don't
wanna...
No,
I
don't
wanna
join
up.
Suppertime,
you
lazy
prick.

Goddamn
waste
of
lungs.

Who's
lazy
now,
Sheriff?




Hey.
Wow.
You
look
amazing.
And
maybe
a
little
uncomfortable.
Oh,
shit!
I'm
totally
overdressed,
aren't
I?
No.
I've
never
done
formal
before.
And
the
lady
at
the
boutique
and
no
one
else
is
wearing
this.

Who
cares
what...
These
are
all
fuckers.
I
look
like
Jane
Austen

You
do
not
look
No,
you
look
absolutely
beautiful.
You
can
breathe
in
There's
nothing
I
like
more
than
putting
on
some
and
just
being
able
to
relax.
Yeah,
this
is
an
end-of-the-workday
I'm
very
glad
I
I
somehow
require
to
Oh,
yeah.
I
like
your
bustle,
by
the
way.
Oh,
yeah.
I
really
love
that
the
most
a
woman
can
make
today
is
to
simulate
a
fat
ass.
-
That
is
a
simulation
of
a
fat
ass,
right
there.
If
I
was
a
black
guy,
this
is
the
Because
I'd
be
like,
"There's
a
fat
ass,
my
favorite."
And
then
I'd
lift
it
up
and
I'd
be
I
know,
exactly,
because
there's
nothing
but
a
ALBERT:
Wow!
You
are
ready

the
very
least,

spend
my
last

Do
you
trust
me?
Yeah,
I
do.
Good.
You're
gonna
be
fine.
If
I
thought
you
were
I'd
make
you
call
it
off.
Okay?

Yeah,
okay.
Trust
me.

Hey,
how
about
it
Thank
you.
Hey,

Scalpers.
But
I

ya,

it

you
can't

Okay,

line
up

Come

go.
No,
no,
no!
I
suck
at
dancing.
No
one

How
will
they
not
notice?
Because
you
suck
at
everything.
Well,
well!
Hello,

sheepie.
Hello,
Foy.
Hey,
Louise.
Hey,
Albert.
So,

any
maiden

Hey.
So,
Albert
and
I
are
gonna
split,
but
I
just
wanted
to
come
by
Thank
you.
So,
I
guess
it's
kind
of
weird
knowing
that
a
woman
If
you
don't
mind,
my
girlfriend
and
I
are
Want
to
know
the
I
can
outdrink
you,
too.
That,
I
can
assure
Fifty
cents
to
the
winner.
One,
two,
three.

Oh,
shit!
Don't
feel
bad.
Alcohol
doesn't
harmonize
well
with
a
I
guess
not.
Here
you
go.
You
can
buy
your
Excuse
me?
You're
an
idiot.
You
have
the
nicest
guy
in
the
world
and
here
you
are
with
Who
I
go
out
with
So,
why
don't

How
are
you
so
blind
Enjoy
your
night.
-

No,
my
dear,
they're
God,
I
love
you.

I
love
you,
too.
How's
that?
Ooh.

-
Wow.
-
Um...
Are
you
cold?
A
little.
Here,
take...
-
No,
no,
no!
It's
okay.
This
has
been
in
my
family

I
can't
get
that
goddamn
Oh,
just
think
of
another
song.
I
can't.
There's
only,
Oh,
that's
true.
And
they're
Yeah.
Mmm.

Um...
Hey,
you
know,
whatever
I
just...
I
just
want
Uh...
I
couldn't
have
gotten
And
this
may
be
the
booze
talking,
but
I
think
I
can
do
it.
You
know,
I
think
I
can
beat
him.
Well,
I'll
tell
you
this,
you
than
that
guy
who
dragged
me
out
You
know,
it's
funny.
I
still
feel
like
I
don't
know
anything
about
you
And
I
feel
like
every
time
I
bring
There
really
isn't
My
story
is
a
lot
like
Because
I'll
tell
you,
I
hate
the
Do
you
really?
For
my
own
reasons,
but,
yeah.
Oh,
I
like
you
even
more
now.
There
is
something
about
that's
just
so
much
It's
true,
right?
If
two
people
hate
the
same
Hate
can
move
mountains.

Yes.
Oh,
hey,
you
know
what?
Hey,
Bridget,
Bridget.
-
Yeah,
she
knows.
Come
here.
There
we
go.
ANNA:
Oh,
my
God.
What
is
this?
This
is
just
a
little
Albert.
It's
nothing
huge,
it's
just...
Okay,
don't
get
too
excited.
What
is
it?
What
is
it?
What
is
it?
Holy
shit.
ALBERT:

I
know,
right?
-
He's
smiling.
No,
in
the
picture,
he's
smiling!
ALBERT:
Isn't
that
amazing?
I
bought
that
off
a
peddler
who
was
-
This
is
the
guy
I
was
telling
you
about.
I
didn't
even
know
this
existed.
-
And
apparently,
he's
not
insane.
That's
what
the
guy
told
me.
It
takes
30
seconds
This
guy
would
have
and
smile
for
30
sustained
seconds.
I
know.
I've
never
been
happy
for
No
one
has.
It's
the
fucking
West!
He's
gotta
be
insane!
Who
the
fuck
knows?
This
is
incredibly
sweet.

It's
nothing.
It's...
I
owe
you.
No
one's
ever
done
Oh,
come
on,
now.

Thank
you.
Uh...
I'm
sorry.
I...
I
shouldn't
have
done
that.
No,
it's...
It's
fine.
You...
You've
just
been
a
really
good
Yeah.
I,
um...
It's
late.
Yeah,
I
should
take
you
home.

-

Oh,
thanks.
Good
luck
tomorrow.
Good.

Okay.
Um...


Good
night.
Good
night.


Hello?

What,
uh...
What's
that?
Nothing.

It's
a
weather
experiment.
Oh.
Great
Scott!
Are
you
sure
you
can't
call
it
off?
Of
course
not.
I'd
Baby,
if
you
fight
him
Yes,
that's
what
But
he's
not
a
bad
guy,
Foy.
I
mean,
yeah,
he's
kind
of
a
loser
and
he
always
smells
like
sheep,
but
he
doesn't
deserve
to
be
shot.
Louise!
My
decision
is
final.
Now,
do
it.
Hey,
I'm
really
tired.
Louise!

My
social
stature
is
significant.
I'm
an
important
man.
I
have
my
own
business.
People
envy
me.

Ooh...
-
What's
wrong?
-
Foy!

Hello,
sweetheart.

Where's
Anna?


Well,
now,
I
didn't
think
you'd
show,
sheepie.
Yeah,
listen,
Foy...
Oh...
Oh.
Oh...








Holy
shit.
You
all...
You
all
done?
I'm
good.
Okay.
Listen,
Foy,
she's
all
yours.

Louise,
you
know,
I
really
But,
I
don't
know,
I
guess
I
just
forgot
that
a
And
I've
been
reminded
recently
of
what
it's
like
to
have
And
I
like
it.
So,
if
you
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
I
say,
go
with
God
and
You
know,
I
just
realized
that
last
I
didn't
mean
that
she
I
meant
that
Foy
has
a
moustache,
so,
you
know,
he
gets
hair
in
her
when
he
goes
down
there.
Yeah.

I
got
it.
Anna?
-
Coward.
She's
not
there.
-
Well,
I'm
sure
she's
okay.
We've
been
prepping
for
She
wouldn't
just
not
show
up.
Hey,
do
you...
Do
you
think
Uh...
Maybe,
at
some
point.
I
don't
know.
Well,
when
you
do,
let
us
know
because
maybe
we
can
make
You
know,
we
can
all
get
in
-
Edward,
we
are
not
having
sex.
Ruth!
Let's
fuck!
Coming!


Clinch
Leatherwood.
Great.
Look
at
this.
Another
We
should
all
just
wear
Shh.
Somebody
in
this
wee
shithole
One
of
my
boys
saw
a
man
I
want
to
know
who
it
was.
Oh,
man!
Somebody's
gonna
get
fucked
up.
Now,
you
all
seem
like
good
folk.
And
good
folk
know
better
than
And
this...

This
is
mine.
So,
I'm
going
to
ask
one
more
time.
Who
was
it?
Mmm?
Who?

Now,
you
make
sure
he
Either
he
meets
me
outside
in
the
or
I
start
killing
more
people.
All
right?

Albert,
you
gotta
get
out
of
here.


Boys,
there's
an
abandoned
sod
We'll
stash
the
gold
there.
Ben,
you
take
the
men
I
need
some
alone
Got
it,
Clinch.
Let's
go,
boys.
Come
on!
Go
on,
get
down.

Who
was
it?
Huh?
Mark
Twain.
What?
Is
it?
Jesus.
How
fucking
stupid
are
you?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Who?

I'm
not
gonna
ask
you
again.
Who?
Okay,
it's...
It's
Sheriff
Brady.
I'm
begging
you.
After
all
the
lovely
years
you
think
I
don't
know
-
I'm
not.
Plugger.
Tell
me
who
it
is
or
Plugger
gets
-
Come
on,
Clinch.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Okay,
okay,
okay.
Who?

It's
Albert
Stark.
Albert
Stark.
That's
better.
I've
been
keeping
it
nice
and
soft.
See?

Mmm!
I've
missed
you,
baby.

The
longer
the
ride,
And
he
needs
the
comforting
touch
of
the
woman
he
loves
to
And
now,
I'm
here,
you're
here,
and
we
have
time
to
The
proper
way.
Hey,
asshole.



Oh,
shit.
I
can't
leave
him
like
that.
That's
better.


ANNA:
Albert?
Albert!
Albert,
you
gotta
get
out
of
here.
Yeah,
that's...
That's
No,
no,
no.
Like,
right
now.
Clinch
is
gonna
be
looking
for
you.
Yeah,
I'm
leaving.
Uh,
I'm
going
to
San
Francisco.
Just
what
I
should
I'm
so
sorry.
Yeah,
well,
you
know,
so
am
I.
What
about
your
dad?
I
asked
him
if
he
wanted
He's
up
on
the
hill,
burying
Look,
I
never
meant
to
mislead...
Okay,
you
know
what,
Anna?
Don't
even
waste
my
time,
okay?
Don't
even
waste
my
time.
You
had
a
million
opportunities
to
I
didn't
lie.
What
would
you
call
it?
You're
married
to
the
most
You
don't
think
maybe
that's
I
didn't
tell
you
because
I
Oh,
bullshit!
You
were
looking
And
because
I
liked
you.
I
didn't
want
to
scare
you
away.
I
never
thought
I'd
meet
What,
somebody
who
hasn't
killed
Yeah,
that's
really
hard
to
find.
That's
why
women
are
always
going,
"Oh,
my
God.
Why
are
all
Hey.
It's
not
my
fault,
all
right?
We
were
married
when
I
was
nine.
Nine?

How
does
that
even
work?
Yeah,
of
course
there
was
a...
My
parents
were
there,
I
just
didn't
want
to
end
15-year-old
spinsters,
you
know?
You
know,
I
don't
even
know...
I
don't
even
know
Every
girl
that
I
ever
fall
in
love
And
every
time,
I'm
surprised.
You
love
me?
Oh,
you
know
what?
All
right.
I
lied,
fine.
What
was
I
supposed
Was
I
supposed
to
go,
"I've
been
fucking
a
Oh,
he
waited
a
year?
Well,
late
nine.
I
rounded
it
up.
It
doesn't
matter.
I
knocked
him
out,
and
I
stuck
You
what?
That's
how
much
you
mean
to
me.
You
know,
I
loved
a
girl
who
Is
your
name
even
Anna?
Huh?
Or
is
it
something
My
name
is
Anna.
I'm
that
That
was
the
real
me.
Possibly
for
the
first
I
just
didn't
think
I
But
you
know
what?
I
do.
I
love
you.


It's
Clinch.
Oh,
shit.
There's
a
trail
out
back
Go.
-
He's
gonna
kill...
Albert,
he
always
shoots
on
"two."



Enoch,
Jordy,
look
He
ain't
here,
Clinch.
Oh,
he's
around.
He's
around.
Stark!
I
know
you're
here,
Stark!
Ben,
check
the
outhouse.



Lewis.
Sometime
this
week,

Sorry,
boss.


Hey!
There
he
goes!
Boss!
Shit.
-
Get
him!
Hyah!



Hyah!
Ha!



What
in
the
hell
do
we
do
now?
He'll
be
back.
Ah,
Curtis.
That
was
I
tell
you,
when
we
get
out
of
this,
I'm
Sound
good?
Get
you
whatever
you
want.
Can
even
get
you
a
cow,
Want
to
fuck
a
cow?
You
seem
like
a
pretty

Now,

RUTH:
Yes,
I'm
absolutely
sure.
EDWARD:
Wow,

can't
believe
we're
RUTH:
Eddie,
with
Clinch
Leatherwood
So,
under
the
circumstances,
I
think
God
will
forgive
us.
Okay,
here
we
go.
Are
you
excited?
Yeah,
this
is
my
first
vagina.
You've
never
seen
one?
No.
I
feel
like
I
should
have
Okay,
you
ready?
-
Yeah.

Okay.
What?
Are
you

stupid.
Haven't
you,
Albert?
You've
been
with
my
wife.
Well,
we
haven't
actually
done
it,
if
that
makes
any
Okay,

Uh-huh.
Take
out
your
gun.
Point

at
me.

No.
Good
boy.
Now,

shoot

three.
One.




I've
been
playing
cards
a
long
time
and
I
would
never
have
Where'd
you
learn
to
shoot?
Your
wife.
Oh,
snap!
Holy
fuck.
Okay,
look,
look,
look!
just
grant
me
a
few
Make

quick.
Let
Anna

All
right?
Let
her
live.
This
is
not
her
fault.
I
kissed
her,
she
didn't
It's
not
her
fault.
I
mean,
she
didn't
tell
so
it's
a
little
bit
So,

I
guess
So,
maybe
just
shoot
What
the...
And
one
more
thing.
Um,
my
grandparents
were
Arabic.
So,
I'm
required
by

recite
the
Islamic
death
This
will
only
take
a
moment.


Hey,
what's
the
matter,
Clinch?
You
not
feeling
well?
You
okay,
boss?
What's
happening
to
me?
You
know,
there
are
a
million
There's,
uh,
famine,
And,
uh,
wild
animals.
And,
you
know,
the
funny
thing
is,
you
don't
even
have
to
get
bitten.
All
you
need
is
a
introduced
into
your
bloodstream
and
you're
pretty
much
screwed.
For
example,
if
you
drain
from
the
fangs
of
a
diamondback
you
really
only
need
one
shot.
Now,
I
knew
my
aim
wasn't
good
enough
But
if
I
caught
you
by
surprise...
Well,
Anna
taught
me
just
enough
And
just
a
small
amount
is
enough
to
kill
a
man
if
he's...
RUTH:
Albert.
He's
dead.
You
did
it.
Oh.
Yeah.
Did
he
hear
all
that
Uh...
No.
No,
I
don't
think
so.
Oh.
Well,
it
was
still
good,
though.
Yeah,
it
was
great.
I
thought
it
was
really
good.


MAN:
Stop!
Albert!
I'm
really
horny
right
now.

Let's
go

the
shade
and

Well

You

God!

really
Arabic,

you?
Oh,

God.

"No!
Oh,
my
God!"

No,
