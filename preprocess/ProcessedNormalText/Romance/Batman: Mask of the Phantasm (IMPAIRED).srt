MAN:
This
has
been
Three
years
on
the
plates
alone.
But
I
think
you'll
find
the
product
Take
a
good
look,
boys.
Jeez,
Mr.
Sol,
I
can't
tell
You'd
need
one
of
them
It's
identical,
I
want
it
laundered
at
a
half
mil
Anybody
got
a
problem
with
that?
The
Bat!
SOL:


VOICE:
Batman!
How
did
you
get
here?
VOICE:
You
ain't
the
Bat!
Who...?
Who
are
you?
I
want
you,
Chuckie
boy.



This
time
I
got
you,
What...?!


MAN
1:
Look
at
that!
WOMAN:
What
happened?
WOMAN:
Up
there!

I'm
telling
you,
friends,
How
many
times
are
we
gonna
Sorry,
councilman,
...for
what
happened
to
Chuckie
Sol.
He's
a
loose
cannon,
commissioner.
It's
not
just
my
opinion.
A
lot
of
people,
...think
Batman's
as
unstable
What
kind
of
city
are
we
running...
...when
we
depend
on
the
support
Such
rot,
sir.
Oh,
by
the
way,
I
pressed
your
tights
Thank
you,
Alfred.
Might
one
inquire
what
this
is?
A
piece
of
windshield
There's
a
chemical
residue
on
it.
Some
kind
of
dense,
long-chain
Adaptogenic,
of
course.
Of
course.
WOMAN:
-
It'll
be
good
to
see
you
again,
Arthur.
And
don't
worry
about
a
thing.
Don't
forget,
you've
got
a
bigtime
I
can't
believe
it's
been
10
years.
ARTHUR:
Thinking
of
looking
Oh,
Arthur,
don't
start
that
again.
That's
encouraging.

Oh,
come
on,
Bruce.
Haven't
you
ever
thought
Oh,
never
say
the
M
word
It
makes
him
nervous.
What
about
the
I
word?
-
The
I
word?

WOMAN
1:
I'd
watch
out
for
Brucie
First
he
wines
and
dines
you...
...makes
you
think
you're
the
only
And
just
when
you're
wondering
...he
forgets
your
phone
number.

That's
Bruce
Wayne's
style.

Bruce?

ARTHUR:
A
friend
in
need?
-
So
how
goes
the
Bat
bashing?
It's
almost
as
if
you
pick
them...
...because
you
know
At
least
since
that
one
girl.
Andrea?
Yes!
Andrea
Beaumont.
How
did
you
let
her
get
loose?
Thanks
for
the
handkerchief,
Arthur.
BRUCE:
ANDREA:
That's
right.
And
if
Daddy
...he's
going
to
build
a
moat
Oh,
it's
times
like
this
-
Yes?
I
thought
you
were
saying
something.
No.
Okay.
Know
who
that
was?
Bruce
Wayne.
I've
seen
him
on
campus.
Very
moody.
-
Yes?
-
Who
are
you
talking
to?
-
Oh,
well,
I
didn't
mean
to...
Mom
doesn't
have
much
to
say
today.
I'm
not
the
only
one
who
talks
I
didn't
say
anything.
It's
just
that
when
I
talk
to
her
out
loud,
I
can
hear
her,
like
she's
right
there.
I've
talked
to
my
parents.
-
What
did
you
say?
ANDREA:
What
vow?
Ooh,
a
man
of
mystery.
Have
you
kept
your
vow?
So
far.
-
Andrea
Beaumont.
I
know.
The
boy
billionaire.
So
tell
me,
...how
come
you
always
look
like

Why
should
you
care?

Mother
was
asking.
THIEF
1:
Let's
step
on
it.
THIEF
2:

Coming
through.
All
clear
here.
Well,
Bruce,
here
goes.
THIEF
1:

On
your
stomachs,
arms
spread!
-
Who's
this
clown?
Yeah,
you
heard
him,
boys.
-
You
heard
Mr.
Kung
Fu.
THIEF
2:
Yes!

Excuse
me.
Hey,
Jonesy.
There!

Oh...


ALFRED:
I
read
about
your
anonymous
...are
you
sure
you
won't
Sorry,
Alfred,
but
the
plan
is
working.
I
had
the
edge.
I
could
feel
it.
There
was
only
one
thing
wrong:
I
must
strike
fear
in
them
Pardon,
Master
Bruce,
but
we
may
want
I
believe
you
have
a
visitor.
Hi.
Hey,
what
happened
to
you?
It's
been
three
days
since
we
met,
I
figured
you
must
be
dead
You
expect
every
guy
you
meet
The
ones
that
are
smart
enough
-
What
is
that?
Gesundheit.
-
That
was
a
joke.
It
takes
years
to
master.
Hey!
ANDREA:
Miss
Hovey's
self-defense
class
He
laughs.
Nice
footwork.
Can
you
dance
too?
Oh.
ALFRED:
Pardon,
sir,
but
Miss
Bambi
BAMBl:
-
You
guys
wait
here.

They
say
the
Bat
iced
this
guy.

Tut,
tut.
Chuckie,
Chuckie.
You
always
were
a
loser.
VOICE:
Buzz.
Who's
there?
Buzz
Bronski.
Get

DAVE:

Oh,

Hey!
It's
the
Bat!
It's
the
stinking
Bat!
VALESTRA:
No!

What
do
you
mean,
you
won't?
He
didn't
do
it.
It's
garbage,
Mr.
Reeves.
You
want
him,
you
get
him.
ARTHUR:
Any
ideas?
Hm.
He's
usually
here
by
now.
There
appears
to
be
some
Could

Not
much,
but
it's
been

You'd
think

Sorry,
Mom,
but

You.
Bruce?
ARTHUR:
So
I'm
having
the
banker
Says
he
can
roll
your
money
-
Amount?
What
amount?
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
I
was
just
reminiscing.
Hey,
that's
okay.
WAITER:

ARTHUR:
Remember
this
place?
You,
me
and
Daddy
How
is
the
old
guy?
-
Closer
than
ever.
...but
then,
I've
always
wished
Well,
who
knows
what
WOMAN:
Welcome
to
Gotham
A
bright
tomorrow
filled
with
hope
This
is
a
vision
of
...
where
we
shall
all
spend

Do
you
think
we'll
really
see
Oh...
ANDREA:
-
Bruce,
I'm
talking
to
you.
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
Andi.
-
Like
what?
Anyone's
in
particular,
BRUCE:
Well,
you
know.
Since
when
do
you
talk
to
me
By
the
way,
Dad's
been
-
Oh,
yeah?
-
Oh,
I
can
meet
him.
I'll
call
him
right
now.
-
You
sure
about
this?
What
the
heck
am
I
doing,
Alfred?
I
must
be
going
nuts.
If
I
may
make
so
bold,
Master
Bruce,
ARTHUR:
Here
are
the
partnership
papers.
ANDREA:
BEAUMONT:
Well,
this
is
At
last
I
meet
-
Nice
to
meet
you,
sir.
Andrea's
told
me
so
much,
Daddy.
-
Don't
mind
me,
I
was
just
leaving.
This
is
Arthur
Reeves,
one
of
the
He's
someone
you
should
-
I
hope
we're
not
interrupting
anything.
I'm
never
too
busy
for
my
Andi
I
tell
you,
Bruce,
When
it
comes
to
money,
But
money
means
little
if
you
Nothing's
more
important
than
family.
-
Yes,
Mr.
Beaumont.
Excuse
me,
sir,
but
there's
He
says
he
has
an
appointment.
If
Mr.
Valestra
says
he
has
...then
Mr.
Valestra
That's
what
I
like
about
your
pop,
Is
my
shirt
too
big,
ANDREA:
Well,
Mr.
Valestra
is
not
BRUCE:
No
kidding.
That's
just
Daddy's
business.
It's
not
your
father,
Andi,
it's...

THUG
1:
Uh-huh.
Give
me!
Hey,
Eddie,
MAN:
No,
don't
hurt
me!
-
I
gotta
stop
this.
What
do
you
expect
me
to
do,
Just
come
back
to
me
THUG

BRUCE:

THUG

Better

THUG
2:
Come
on!
Pick
up

Oh,
thank
God
you're
all
right.
-
Come
on,
let
me
have
a
look
at
you.
What
am
I
still
doing
this
for?
It's
gotta
be
one
or
the
other.
I
can't
put
myself
on
the
line
if
there's
Miss
Beaumont
would
be
glad
to
know
She's
holding
on
line
one,
sir.
Master
Bruce?
Alfred,
I
can't.
Not
now.
-
Well,
what
shall
I
say,
sir?
I
just
don't
know!
BRUCE:
I
don't
wanna
let
you
down,
But
it
just
doesn't
hurt
You
can
understand
that,
can't
you?
Look,
I
can
give
money
to
the
city,
Let
someone
else
take
the
risk.
Please.
I
need
it
to
be
different
now.
I
know
I
made
a
promise,
I
didn't
count
on
being
happy.
Please.
Tell
me
that
it's
okay.
ANDREA:
Maybe
they
sent
me.

Hey!
Get
in.
All
I
wanna
know
is,
is
it
true?
-
Is
the
Batman
really
hitting
our
people?
Beautiful.
That's
just
beautiful.
Why?
He
never
leaned
on
us
before.
I
suppose
you
could
What
are
you,
a
comedian?
This
is
A
freak
job!
He'll
crucify
me!

Pull
over.
It's
not
very
healthy
in
here.

BRUCE:
O'Neil
Funding
Corporation.
-
Oh,
I
should
have
known.
Chuckie
Sol
and
Buzz
Bronski.
They
were
partners
in

The
third
director
was
Hm.
Sal's
having
company
tonight.
Meaning,
I
trust,
that
once
you're
You
think
you
know
everything
I
diapered
your
bottom.
Well,
you're
wrong.
BRUCE:
ANDREA:
You
know
how
much
I've
...and
Dad
has
business
there
It's
some
sort
of
hush-hush
deal.
He
can't
even
say
when
we'd
be
back.
Will
you
at
least
let
me
try
-
Bruce.
Oh,
never
mind.
I'm
no
good
at
this.
Here.
You'll
get
the
idea.

What
do
you
say?
Of
course
I
will.
I
always
felt
like
Like
you
never
knew
what
to
do
You
are
now.
I'm
changing
the
plan.

Uh-oh.
Looks
like
Dad's
got
company.
He
doesn't
usually
see
clients
here.
Maybe
we
should
wait
till
tomorrow
-
Maybe.
-
Alfred.

BRUCE:
Could
be
as
big
as
the
house,
judging
-
Alfred,
what's
wrong?
"Left
with
Dad."
"Too
young"?
"Need
time"?
"Forget
about
me."
My
God.
If
there
was
just
some
other
way.

It's

Hello,

Why
so
formal?

So,
what's
an

you
Business.
I
got...
Business!
Sounds
like
fun.
Come.
We'll
repair
to

Now,
hold
on

It's
going
to
be
a
bumpy
ride.



Honey,
I'm
home.

Oh,

mind
my

Rusty.
Can't
be
too
careful,
What?
Meat

Oh,
I
had
it
for
lunch.
Isn't
Hazel
here
a
cutie?
True,
she's
a
real
homebody,
but
you
Come.
Have
a
seat,
Sal.
Tell
me
what's
on
your
so-called
mind.
It's
Batman.
He's
gone
nuts.
First
he
whacked
Chuckie
Sol,
...and
now
he's
after
me.
I've
been
reading
lately
how
old
Guano
Wouldn't
it
be
great
if
I'd
finally
This
isn't
a
joke.
Batman's
knocking
us
off.
Look,
5
million
up
front
with
whatever

What
do
I
look
like,
pest
control?
Think,
you
fool.
Once
he
gets
me,
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about.
Dirtier.
Don't
touch
me,
old
man.
Oh,
Sal,
no
one
could
take
a
joke
-
Of
course
I'll
help
you
out.

No
way
is
anybody
gonna
hurt
That's
it.
That's
what
I
want
to
see.
A
nice
big
smile.
-
Thanks
for
another
lovely
dinner.
You
know,
it's
not
good
We
could
stay
up,
talk
for
a
while.
Oh,
Artie,
I've
got
a
killer
day
-
Good
night.
Hmph.
So
we
meet
again.
Not
sure
about
the
mask,
though.
Have
you
ever
seen
this?
-
No.
He's
the
one
who
set
up
So?
That's
his
job.
He
was
the
one
element
-
Where's
your
father
now?
-
Why
don't
you
try
Madagascar.
You
told
him
you
were
-
You
had
me
bugged,
is
that
it?
Then
read
them
now:
Get
out.
You
still
following
your
dad's
orders?
The
way
I
see
it,
the
only
one
in
this
Sal
Valestra.

JOKER:
Guess
the
joke
is
on
me.
Looks
like
there's
a
new
face
And
soon
his
name
will
be
To
say
nothing
of
his

Let
her
go!
Please,

Give
me
one
more
day.
Convince

As
soon

Let's
go,
boys.

Dad,
are
you
all
right?
-
We've
got
to
get
to
the
airport
now.
-
But
you
said
you'd
have
the
money.
The
money's
tied
up
in
investments.
But
I
can't
leave.
Bruce
proposed
to
me.
Listen
to
me.
I
just
used
up
the
last
shred
of
pity
If
I
don't
pay
him
back
within
24
hours,
How...?
Why
did
you
do
this,
Dad?
Why
did
you
get
involved
I'm
sorry,
Andi.
I
just
wanted
a
chance
for
you...
I'll
get
you
out
of
this.
Whatever
it
takes.
ANDREA:
From
that
night,
we
were
Eventually
settled
on
Dad
was
able
to
parlay
the
money
Finally
he
had
enough
It
would
never
be
enough.
They
wanted
interest
We
had
to
find
another
way.
The
man
in
the
costume.
Your
father?
He
said
he'd
get
them.
Somehow.
When
I
heard
about
Chuckie
Sol,
To
stop
him.
I'm
sorry,
Bruce.
That's
twice
now
I've
come
Can
we
make
it
work
this
time?
I
want
to
say
yes...
...but
you
know
it's
going
to
come
down
Daddy
doesn't
matter
anymore.

-
I'll
see
you
tonight.
It's
so
good
to
see
you
Might
one
ask
what
this
bodes
I'm
not
sure,
Alfred.
Everything's
happening
so
fast.
-
So
much
has
changed.
It's
true.
I
love
her.
Maybe
after
this
is
settled...
...maybe
then.
I'm
sure
they
would've
wanted
you
-
Hm.
Maybe.
Oh,
no.

telling
me

Unbelievable.

You!
That's
right,

What
a

op.
You're

mine.
Oh,

I'm
crushed.
Don't
you
remember?
ARTHUR:
I
never
met

you.

I
didn't
know
what

was
doing.
And
put
it
to
good
use,
eh?

What
do
you
want?
Haven't
you
read
the

Wrong.
It
ain't
the

Nope,
nope.
I've
seen
the
guy.
He
looks
more

It
has
to
do
with
the
gangster
murders,
Why?
I
don't
know.
That's
not
the
answer
I
want.
Beaumont
needed
me
to
help
him
We

in
touch.
When

Years
ago.
My

I
was
running
out

He
said
no.
So
you
sold
him
to

Mob.
I
was
broke,
desperate.
They
said
all
they
wanted
DOCTOR:
Councilman,
please.

JOKER:

boopsy,
even
though
...I
still

a
soft
spot
for
you.
So
I'm
sending
you
a

Dad?

Well,
Haz,

it's
time
What
do
you
say,
hon?
Ain't
it
always
the
way?
You

in
the
mood
Joker.
Your
angel
of
death
awaits.
I'm
impressed,
lady.
You're
harder
to
kill
So
you
figured
it
out?
Gotta
hand
it
to
you,
nice
scheme.
Costume's
a
bit
theatrical,

Very

But

Nice
trick,
sweetheart.
You
could
teach

You're
not
smiling,
Joker.
Me?
Oh,
no.

Made
you
look.

JOKER:
Just
in

meet
her

How
about
a

pick-me-up?


Your
father's
dead,
isn't
he?
You
came
into
town
early
...so
you
could
shift
the
blame
They
took
everything,
Bruce.
I'm
not
saying
it's
right,
or
even
sane,
So
either
help
me
-
You
know
I
can't
do
that.
What
we
could've
had.
But,
Andi,

anyone
knows
the
answer
to
that,
Leave,
Andi.
Now.
Please.

20
miles
of

minutes,
everything
goes
up.

You
just
don't
know
What
are
you
doing?
You're
crazy.
I'm
your
only
chance
Let
me
go
or
we'll
both

Whatever
it

You've
got
to

out
of
here.
This
place
is
wired
to

No.
One
way
or
another,
Goodbye,
my

BRUCE:
I
couldn't

her,
Alfred.
I
don't

I

heaven
for
that.
But
Andrea

And

Quite

sorry.
Do

wanna
be
alone?
