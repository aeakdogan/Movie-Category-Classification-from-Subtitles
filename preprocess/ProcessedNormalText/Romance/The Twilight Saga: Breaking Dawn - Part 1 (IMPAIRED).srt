BELLA:
"Childhood
is
not
"And
at
a
certain
age,
the
child
is
grown
"Childhood
is
the
kingdom
Jake!
Jacob!

Phil!
It's
happening.

You
just
have
to
break
them
in.
I've
been
breaking
them
in.
For
three
days.
Can
I
just
go
barefoot?
No,
absolutely
not.
Just
thinking
it's
a
little
much,
you
know?
The
dress
and
the
shoes,
and
all
of
this.
ALICE:
No,
it's
exactly
enough.
Tomorrow
will
be
perfect.
Where
do
you
want
them,
boss?
On
either
side
of
the
aisle.
-
What
aisle?
You,
go
home
and
get
lots
of
beauty
sleep.
That's
an
order.
Okay.
I
was
just
checking
for
cold
feet.
Well,
mine
are
toasty
warm.
It's
not
too
late
to
change
your
mind.
What?
Now
you're
having
second
thoughts?
You
are.
No,
I've
been
waiting
a
century
But?
I
haven't
told
you
everything
about
myself.
What?
You're
not
a
virgin?


Look,
you
can't
scare
me
away
now.
Look,
a
few
years
after
Carlisle
created
me,
I
rebelled
against
him.
I
resented
him
for
curbing
my
appetite.
And
so
for
a
while,
I
went
off
on
my
own.
I
wanted
to
know
how
it
felt
to
hunt.


EDWARD:
To
taste
human
blood.


All
the
men
I
killed
were
monsters.
And
so
was
I.
Edward,
they
were
all
murderers.
You
probably
saved
more
lives
Bella,
that's
what
I
told
myself.
But
they
were
all
human
beings.
I
looked
into
their
eyes
as
they
died
and
what
I
was
capable
of.
And
what
I'll
be
capable
of.
Why
are
you
telling
me
this
tonight?
Did
you
really
think
I
just
wondered
and
who
you
wanna
see
when
I
know
I
can
do
this.
Let
me
tell
you
why.
Because
you
did.

You
should
give
yourself
Now,
hopefully,
a
year
from
now,
I'm
gonna
look
in
the
mirror
I
mean,
someone
capable
of
courage
-

EMMETT:
Come
on!
Let's
go!
Send
him
out,
Bella,
So,
this
party.
Will
there
be
strippers?

No,
just
a
couple
of
mountain
lions.
Don't
worry,
Bella,
Okay,
go,
before
they
break
my
house.
EMMETT:
Let's
go!
Let's
go!
I'll
meet
you
at
the
altar.
I'll
be
the
one
in
white.
That
was
very
convincing.

What
did
I
say
about
beauty
sleep?
Sorry,
bad
dream.
It
was
wedding
jitters.
Do
you
need
some
help?
I
could
do
her
hair.
Really?
Please.
Just
my
blatant
lack
of
respect
for
mortality.
Essentially.
Weddings.
They
bring
everyone
together.
Hey,
so,
did
you
find
our
daughter?
Are
those
graduation
caps?

How
creative!
Or
weird.
Alice?
Bella?
BELLA:
In
here,
Mom.

Oh,
my
gosh!
You're
so
beautiful.
Oh,
honey.
Crap!
My
mascara.
Mom!
Thanks.
Charlie,
get
in
here.
You
sure?
I
don't
wanna...
I
know.
I
look
hot.

We
thought
you
needed
something
blue.
And
something
old.
-
Besides
your
mother.
-
It
was
Grandma
Swan's.
It's
beautiful,
you
guys.
Wow.
Thank
you
so
much.
It's
your
first
family
heirloom.
Pass
on
to
your
daughter,
and
her
daughter.
Mom,
I
love
it.
Nope.
No
smudging
my
masterpiece.
She's
right.
Thank
you.
ALICE:
Okay.
Time
for
the
dress!

ALICE:
Do
you
wanna
see
it?

ERIC:
They
have
got
to
be
related.
What
a
gene
pool.
ERIC:
Seriously.
You've
got
some...
The
drool.
So,
you
think
Bella's
gonna
be
showing?
Jess,
she
is
not
pregnant.
Okay.
Who
else
gets
married
at
18?


You
ready?

Yeah.
Just
don't
let
me
fall,
Dad.
Never.
MINISTER:
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
to
witness
the
union
of
Edward
Cullen
Please
repeat
after
me.
I,
Edward
Cullen.
Take
you,
Bella
Swan.
-
Take
you,
Bella
Swan.

To
have
and
to
hold.
For
better
or
for
worse.
For
richer,
for
poorer.
In
sickness
and
in
health.
To
love.
To
cherish.
As
long
as
we
both
shall
live.
I
do.
I
love
you.

Have
I
found
you
Flightless
bird
Jealous
Weeping
or
lost
you
American
mouth
Big
pill
looming
Now
I'm
a
fat
house
cat
Nursing
my
sore
blunt
tongue
Watching
the
warm
poison
rats
Curl
through
the
wide
fence
cracks

Just
thought
it'd
be
bigger.
Yeah.
-
Hi!
We
were
just
saying
how
pretty
Well,
thanks
so
much.
-
No.
-
No.
Hey,
man.
Nice
to
see
you.
-
I'm
happy
for
you.
I
hope
you'll
be
happy,
Bella.
Thank
you,
Billy.
Have
you
heard
from
him?
I'm
sure
Jake
wishes
you
the
best.
Well,
I
plan
on
getting
drunk.
They're
serving
up
Sue,
can
I
get
you
a
glass?
Sparkling
fire
water.
Sounds
great.
CARMEN:
Bella.
-
Congratulations,
Edward.
Bella.
Eleazar
and
Carmen,
right?
-
Mmm-hmm.
Yes,
and
these
are
our
cousins
from
Alaska.
-
Tanya,
Kate.
-
Welcome
to
the
family.
BELLA:
Thank
you.
Irina.
Come
meet
Bella.
-
I
can't
do
this.
They
invited
one.
Irina,
he's
our
friend.
They
killed
Laurent.
He
tried
to
kill
Bella.
I
don't
believe
that.
He
wanted
to
be
like
us.
To
live
in
peace
with
humans.
With
me.
I'm
sorry.
CARMEN:
Irina!
Let's
not
monopolize
the
bride.
BELLA:
Thank
you.
Sorry.
Well,
what's
a
wedding
-
Yeah.
Is
this
on?
Hello?

Umm,
I'd
like
to
propose
a
toast.
To
my
new
sister.
Bella,
I
hope
you've
gotten
enough
sleep
'Cause
you
won't
be
getting
any
more

Well,
Bella
was
just
like
everybody
else,
Or
"The
Hair,"
as
I
call
him.
And
then,
suddenly,
Edward
is
all
about
Bella.
Even
though
she's
not
the
captain
I'm
just
kidding.
I'm
just
kidding.
Or
the
president
of
the
student
council.
Edward
will
be
a
good
husband.
I
know
this
because
I'm
a
cop.
I
know
things.
Like
how
to
hunt
somebody

Now
that
you're
my
sister,
you'll
have
to
get
over
And
I
know
how
to
use
a
gun.
Skirts,
heels,
handbags.

Go
to
sleep,
my
love
Go
to
sleep
When
you
wake
You'll
see
me
I'd
like
to
thank
Renée
and
Charlie
for
bringing
such
a
wonderful
person
We
will
cherish
and
protect
her
forever.
It's
an
extraordinary
thing
to
meet
someone
And
who
will
accept
you
for
what
you
are.

I've
been
waiting,
to
get
beyond
what
I
am.
And
with
Bella,
I
feel
like
I
can
finally
begin.
So
I'd
like
to
propose
a
toast
No
measure
of
time
with
you
But
let's
start
with
forever.

Whoa!
SETH:
Whoa!
Another
one
of
your
gifts
just
arrived.
What?
Yeah,
come
on.
What's
a
wedding
present
doing
out
here?
Just
a
little
more
private.
The
best
man
didn't
have
time
to
get
a
tux.
Jacob!
Jacob.
-

-
Hey,
Bella.
This
is
kind
of
you.
Kind
is
my
middle
name.
I'll
see
if
Rosalie
wants
to
dance.
I'm
sorry
I'm
late.
Doesn't
matter.
Everything's
perfect
now.
Will
you
dance
with
me?

Where
have
you
been?
We
were
gonna
put
your
face
Mostly
northern
Canada.
I
think.
It's
weird
to
be
back
on
two
legs
again,
Gotten
out
of
practice
Are
you
okay?
Being
here?
Why?
Afraid
I'll
trash
your
party?

You're
not
the
only
one.
You'd
think
I'd
be
used
to
telling
you
Come
on,
you're
not
supposed
to
be
Everyone
cries
at
weddings.
This
is
how
I'm
gonna
remember
you.
Pink
cheeks.
Two
left
feet.
Heartbeat.
'Cause
what,
No.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
just
trying
to
appreciate
Well,
it's
not
my
last
night.
I
thought
you...
I
didn't
really
wanna
spend
my
honeymoon
What's
the
point?
It's
not
like
you're
gonna
have
It's
gonna
be
as
real
as
anyone
else's.
That's
a
sick
joke.
You
are
joking?
What?
While
you're
still
human?
You
can't
be
serious,
Bella.
I
mean,
it's
really
none
of
your
business.
-
No!
You
can't
do
this!
-
Listen
to
me,
Bella.
Jacob,
calm
down,
all
right?
Are
you
out
of
your
mind?
Huh?
Walk
away,
Jake.
Enough,
Jacob!
Stay
out
of
this,
Sam.
You're
not
gonna
start
something
She'll
die.
She's
not
our
concern
anymore.
Let's
go,
Seth!
BELLA:
I'm
really,
really,
really
stupid.
No,
it's
all
right.
Come
on,
people
are
probably
missing
us.

So,
he
really
won't
tell
you
No,
it's
a
surprise.

Well,
wear
a
hat.
Sunscreen.
Take
care
of
yourself.
I
will.
Okay.
I
love
you,
Bella.
I
love
you.
So
much.
Thank
you.
Everything's
packed
and
ready
to
go.
Cool.
Oh.
-
I'm
gonna
go
see
him.
Dad.

Well...
It's
gonna
be
strange,
you
not
living
under
my
roof.
Yeah.
It's
gonna
be
strange
for
me,
too.
You
know
I
love
you,
Dad.
Forever.
I
love
you,
too,
Bells.
I
always
have
and
I
always
will.
All
right.
Go
on.
You
don't
wanna
miss
your
plane.
Wherever
it's
going.

Okay.
Bye.
You
ready?

Yeah,
I'm
ready.




Please
pull
over.

So,
we're
not
staying
in
Rio?
No,
we're
just
passing
through.
Are
we
close?
EDWARD:
That's
Isle
Esme.
It
was
a
gift
from
Carlisle.

Is
this
totally
necessary?
I
am
nothing
if
not
traditional.
You
wanna
take
a
look
around?
You
tired?

Do
you
wanna
go
for
a
swim?
Yeah,
that
sounds
nice.
I
could
use
a
few
human
minutes.
Don't
take
too
long,
Mrs.
Cullen.

Okay.


Okay.
She's
a
caged
animal
London
by
night
Crashing
lights
and
cymbals
Queens
of
twilight
And
if
I
was
you
I'd
use
the
loo
Before
the
long
drive
We
complement
each
other
Just
like
Satan
and
Christ
Baby,
when
I
am
laid
to
rest
May
my
laughter
remain
Like
your
kiss
blew
me
away
Answer
your
spirit
I
gotta
know
right
now
I
see
you
before
me
Won't
you
show
me
how?
Alice!
I
wear
my
hair
fizzy
I
don't
copy
no
style
But
kissing
and
a-scrubbing
It
has
consequences
You're
on
the
bus
again
Past
Big
Ben
With
your
rip
off
Oyster
card

Don't
be
a
coward.


Gotas
mínimas
Caudales
de
agua
You're
so
beautiful.
Agua
lisa
I
promised
that
we'd
try.
If
this
doesn't
work...
I
trust
you.
Tu
vida...


I've
waited
a
hundred
years
But
I'd
wait
a
million
more
For
you

Nothing
prepared
me
It's
okay.
If
I
had
only
felt
the
warmth
If
I
had
only
seen
Or
how
you
curl
your
lip
I
would
have
known
what
I
was
living
for
What
I've
been
living
for
Your
love
is
my
turning
page
Only
the
sweetest
words
remain
Every
kiss
is
a
cursive
line
Every
touch
is
a
redefining
phrase
I
surrender
who
I've
been
for
who
you
are
Nothing
makes
me
stronger
If
I
had
only
felt
how
it
feels
to
be
yours
I
would
have
known
EDWARD:
How
badly
are
you
hurt?
What?
No,
Bella,
look.
Bella,
I
can't
tell
you
how
sorry
I
am.
I'm
not.
Really,
I'm
not.
I'm
fine.
Don't
say
you're
fine.
Just
don't.
No,
you
don't.
Don't
ruin
this.
I've
already
ruined
it.
Why
can't
you
see
Or
was
five
seconds
ago.
I
mean,
now
I'm
sort
of
pissed
off,
actually.
You
should
be
angry
with
me.
I
mean,
I
think
we
did
amazing.
I
mean,
it
was
amazing
for
me.
That's
what
you're
worried
about?
That
I
didn't
enjoy
myself?
I
know
it's
not
the
same
for
you,
but
for
a
human,
I
can't
imagine
Last
night
was
the
best
night
of
my
existence.
You're
the
best.
You're
not
gonna
touch
me
again,
are
you?
You
know
that's
not
what
I
mean.
Let
me
make
you
breakfast.

Dreamed
last
night
about
a
time
and
place
Where
from
our
troubles
we
had
escape
I
held
your
hand
and
I
felt
complete
As
you
turned
and
said
to
me
From
now
on

From
now
on
we'll
be
You
and
me

We
will
be
From
now
on
From
now
on
we'll
be
You
and
me
We
will
be

Only
a
dream
From
now
on
Only
a
dream
From
now
on
Only
a
dream
From
now
on
Only
a
dream
From
now
on
You
and
me,
we
will
be
I
win.

Bella?
You
having
a
nightmare?
No.

It
was
just
a
dream.
It
was
a
really
good
dream.
Then
why
are
you
crying?
Because
I
wanted
it
to
be
real.
Tell
me.
Bella,
I
can't.
Please.
JACOB:
Maybe
they'll
say
Or
tripped
and
fell
off
a
cliff.
PAUL:
Keep
it
in
play!
Keep
it
in
play!
Come
on!

Come
on!
Come
on!
At
least
I'll
get
one
thing
out
of
it.
No,
you
won't.
Cullens
are
not
a
danger
Well,
he's
either
gonna
kill
her
-
And
the
treaty
says...
I
say.
You
know,
if
you
wanted
things
different,
Turning
it
down
seemed
like
a
good
idea
Jake,
you
really
think
you
could
kill
Bella
No,
make
one
of
us
do
it,
Shut
up,
Leah.
Would
you
just
get
over
it?
At
least
they
seem
happy.
Yeah,
some
people
are
just
lucky,
I
guess.
Lucky?
None
of
them
And
the
sickest
part
is
Least
if
you
imprinted
on
someone,
I
mean,
being
any
kind
of
happy
is
better
about
someone
you
can't
have.

Bella,
these
are
our
housekeepers,

This
is
my
wife
Bella.
Excuse
me.
Well,
I
guess
we
just
leave
them
to
it.
What
was
that
all
about?
She's
afraid
for
you.
Why?
Because
I
have
you
here
all
alone.
You
mean
she
knows
about
you?
She
suspects.
She's
native
Ticuna.
They
have
legends
who
prey
on
beautiful
women.

Hey.

You're
late.

Bella?
Hey,
don't
come
in
here.
You
don't
need
to
see
this.
"In
sickness
and
health,"
remember?
It
must
have
been
the
chicken.
Could
you
grab
my
bag?
What
is
it?
How
many
days
has
it
been
Fourteen.
Why?
Will
you
tell
me
what's
going
on?
I'm
late.
My
period,
it's
late.
That's
impossible.
Can
this
happen?
-
Whoa!
-
Alice.
Are
you
all
right?
I'm
not
100
%¤
sure.
Why?
What's
wrong?
I
just...
You
just
what?
Alice,
what
did
you
see?
-
Here's
Carlisle.
I
don't
know.
I'm
a
little
worried.
Has
Edward
been
harmed?
No.
I
know
that
it's
impossible,
Whoa!
Carlisle,
I
swear,
-
Is
this
even
possible?
What's
he
saying?
The
sooner
Bella's
here,
I
need
you
to
get
to
the
mainland
at
once.
Yeah,
yeah,
I
will.
Well?
Damn
it.

Kaure's
making
sure
you're
still
alive.

Slow
we
paddle
through
the
lake
Straight
to
the
very
center
Of
the
darkest
water
Where
we
can
embrace
The
shadows
on
the
surface
The
eyes
that
look
up
lifeless
From
our
twins
below
And
though
your
arms
and
legs
are
under
Love
will
be
the
echo
in
your
ears
When
all
is
lost
and
plundered
My
love
will
be
there
still
True,
it's
chilling
to
behold
Up
close
we
stumble
back...


What
did
you
do
with
her?
What
do
you
know
about
this?
I
know
that
you
are
a
demon!
You
killed
this
little
girl!
What?
Her
people
have
legends.

Please.
Tell
me
how
to
help
her.
You
only
do
bad.
I
am
begging
you.
I
will
do
anything.
I
love
her.
Please.
Tell
me
how
she
can
survive
this.
Death.
I'm
not
gonna
let
it
hurt
you.
Carlisle
will
get
that
thing
out.
Thing?
Wait
here
while
we
load.

ROSALIE:
Hello?
Bella?
-
What's
going
on?
Hey,
Son.
What's
going
on?
Bella
called
him.
Hey,
haven't
seen
you
in
a
while.
-
You
okay?
They're
extending
their
trip.
Seems
she
caught
a
bug.
They
wanna
wait
until
she
feels
better
She's
sick.
Yeah,
she
told
me
not
to
worry,
I
don't
know,
off.
She'll
be
okay,
Charlie.
Come
on.
Let's
eat.
Jacob,
let
it
go.
Is
it
true?
Hello,
Jacob,
how
are
you?
Listen,
just
give
it
to
me
straight.
BELLA:
Jake,
is
that
you?
-
She's
here?
Jake.
BELLA:
I'm
glad
you
came.
-
Close
enough.
BELLA:
Rose,
it's
okay.

You
look
terrible.
Yeah,
it's
nice
to
see
you,
too.
So,
are
you
gonna
tell
me
Rose,
you
wanna
help
me
up?
You
did
this!
We
didn't
know
it
was
even
possible.
-
What
is
it?
Ultrasounds
and
needles
I
can't
see
it,
either.
And
I
can't
see
Bella's
future
anymore.
CARLISLE:
We've
been
researching
legends,
What
we
do
know
is
that
it's
strong.
And
fast-growing.
Why
haven't
you
done
anything?
This
is
none
of
your
business,
dog.
Rose!
All
this
fighting
isn't
good
for
Bella.
The
fetus
isn't
good
for
Bella.
Say
the
word,
Alice.
"Baby."
Possibly.
Carlisle,
you've
gotta
do
something.
No.
It's
not
his
decision.
It's
not
any
of
yours.
Jacob,
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
I
always
knew
you'd
destroy
her.
She
thinks
Carlisle
can
turn
her
like
he
did
for
me
and
Esme.
-
Can
he?
And
if
her
heart
fails...
Look,
Jacob,

For
her.
You
have
a
connection
with
her
Maybe
you
could
talk
to
her,
You
can
keep
her
alive.
And
if
I
can't?
If
she
dies,
you
get
what
you
always
wanted.
To
kill
me.
Rose,
I'm
fine,
really.
-
So,
Edward
sent
you
in
here
to
talk
to
me?
Though
I
can't
figure
out
I
mean,
you
never
have
before.

Since
when
are
you
and
blondie
BFFs?
Rose
understands
what
I
want.
What
are
you
thinking,
Bella?
Seriously.
I
know
this
seems
like
a
scary
thing,
but
it's
not.
It's
like
this
miracle
or
something.
I
can
feel
him.

So,
it's
a
bouncing
baby
boy.
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
know.
It's
just
a
guess.
When
I
picture
him,
I
see
a
boy.
We'll
see.
You
won't.
Jake,
I
can
do
this.
-
I'm
strong
enough.
You
can
spout
that
crap
to
your
I
can
see
what
that
thing's
doing
to
you.
-
You're
wrong.
what
was
the
point?
How
is
that
right
for
anyone?
Because
I
sure
don't
see
it.
Listen
to
me,
Bella.
Please.
Just
don't
do
this.
Live,
okay?
Please.
Jake,
everything's
gonna
be
okay.
Jacob,
don't
go.
I
know
how
this
ends.
And
I'm
not
sticking
around
to
watch.


BELLA:
Jacob.
JACOB:
Don't
do
this.
BELLA:
I'm
strong
enough.
ROSALIE:
This
is
none
BELLA:
Jacob,
don't
go.
JACOB:
You
did
this!
Everything's
gonna
be
okay.
ALICE:
The
fetus
isn't
good
for
Bella.
JACOB:
I
know
how
this
ends.
Don't
you
even
care
that
it's
killing
you?



WOLVES:
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
PAUL:
Is
it
true,
Jacob?
PAUL:
It's
growing
fast.
LEAH:
It's
unnatural.
QUIL:
Monstrosity.
QUIL:
On
ourland.
JARED:
We
can't
allow
it.
PAUL:
We
can't
allow
it.
SAM:
We
have
to
protect
the
tribe.
What
they've
bred
Every
human
will
be
in
danger.
JARED:
We're
ready.
JACOB:
Now?
SAM:
We
must
destroy
it
before
it's
born.
SETH:
You
mean,
kill
Bella?
SAM:
Her
choice
affects
us
all.
JACOB:
Bella's
human.
LEAH:
She's
dying
anyway!

SAM:
We
have
real
enemies
to
fight
tonight.
JACOB:
Tonight?
SAM:
You
will
fight
with
us,
Jake.


JACOB:

I
will
not.
I
am
the
grandson
of
Ephraim
Black.
I
am
the
grandson
of
a
chief!
I
wasn't
born
to
follow
you,
or
anyone
else.


Whoa.
Don't
worry.
They're
not
following
us.
What
do
you
think
you're
doing
here?
-
I
left
Sam's
pack.
-
I
won't
stand
behind
him.
I'm
not
kidding.
Get
out
of
here.
Is
that
an
order?
I'm
not
ordering
anyone.
Look,
I'm
just
going
off
Great,
and
I've
got
your
back.
No,
you
don't.
If
Sam
comes
after
Bella,
are
you
really
ready
Your
sister?
If
it's
the
right
thing
to
do.
Whatever.
I'm
gonna
go
give
the
Cullens
a
heads-up.
Do
what
you
want.
How
cool
is
this?
Two-man
pack.
You're
getting
on
my
nerves,
Seth.
I'll
shut
up.
Can
do.
Get
ready.
They're
coming
for
Bella.
They're
not
gonna
touch
her.
Agreed.
Man,
I
can
smell
them
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
not
gonna
let
my
little
brother
Go
away,
Leah!
I
can
take
care
of
myself.
That
you
think
so
Okay,
would
the
both
of
you
shut
up?
Did
Sam
send
you?
Sam
doesn't
even
know
I
left.

I
think
he
just
figured
it
out.
Jake.
I
know
what
his
plan
is.
Sam's
lost
the
element
of
surprise,
and
he
doesn't
want
so
he's
not
gonna
come
at
you
head
on.
He's
got
the
place
surrounded
We
won't
get
through
without
a
fight.
No
fights.
We
won't
be
the
ones
to
break
the
treaty.
The
treaty
is
void,
at
least
in
Sam's
mind.
Not
in
ours.
Carlisle,
no
one's
hunted
for
weeks.
We'll
make
do.
You've
done
us
a
great
service,
Jacob.
Thank
you.


I
know
they're
out
there
somewhere,
It's
so
quiet.
I
stopped
hearing
them,
too,
It's
nice.
You
know
you
can't
stay
here.
-
But
I
don't
have
any
place...
You
hate
them
too
much.
You
don't
even
like
me.
I
don't
have
to.
I
just
have
to
follow
you.
Look,
Seth
doesn't
want
you
here.
Being
unwanted
isn't
exactly
Look,
I'll
stay
out
of
your
way.
I'll
do
whatever
you
want,
except
go
back
to
Sam's
pack
and
be

know

Just
to
break
the
connection.

All
right.
I'm
gonna
do

CARLISLE:
Your
rib
is
cracked.
But
there
are
no
splinters.
-
Yet.
It's
breaking
her
bones
now.
It's
crushing
you
from
the
inside
out.
Carlisle,
tell
her
what
you
told
me.
Tell
her.
Carlisle,
tell
me.
It's
all
right.
The
fetus
isn't
compatible
with
your
body.
It's
too
strong.
It
won't
allow
you
to
get
It's
starving
you
by
the
hour.
I
can't
stop
it,
and
I
can't
slow
it
down.
At
this
rate,
your
heart
will
give

Then
I'll
hold
on
as
long
as
I
can,
and
then...
Bella.
There
are
some
conditions
You
understand?
I'm
sorry.
Edward,
I'm
sorry.
I
can't
live
without
you.
You
won't.
You're
gonna
have
a
part
of
me.
He'll
need
you.
Do
you
honestly
think
that
I
could
love
it
It's
not
his
fault.
You
have
to
accept
what
is.
Because
you've
given
me
no
choice!
Bella,
we're
supposed
to
be
partners,
But
you
decided
this
on
your
own.
You've
decided
to
leave
me.
Don't
see
it
that
way.
Well,
I
have
no
other
way
to
see
it.
'Cause
it's
me
who'll
lose
you.
And
I
don't
choose
that.
I
don't
choose
that.

What?
Smile

I'm
your

You're
one

Feels
complete
when
you're
here,
Jake.


We
need
to
find
a
way
-
If
I
could
only
see
the
fetus...
...maybe
I
could
figure
out
what
it
wants.
Think
you
might
be
right.
Jacob
just
had
an
idea.
It
wasn't
an
idea.
It
was
a
snide
comment.
What
were
you
thinking?
That
it's
probably
just
looking
for
someone
He's
thirsty.
I
know
the
feeling.
If
it's
craving,
I
have
some
O
negative
laid
aside
for
Bella.
Walk
with
me.
JACOB:
Wait,
wait,
wait.
You're
gonna
make
her
drink
that?
It's
the
fastest
way
to
test
the
theory.
Only
if
you're
comfortable
with
it.
I'll
try
anything.
Just
hold
on.
I
think
I'm
gonna
be
sick.
This
might
make
it
a
little
easier
to
take.
Tastes
good.
Mmm.
Your
pulse
is
already
getting
stronger.
It's
working.
-
Well,
you
sound
better.
I
feel
much
better.
This
whole
thing
must've
put
a
kink
You
could
say
that.
Otherwise,
married
life
treating
you
okay?
Edward
still
walks
on
water
and
all
that?
Yeah,
but,
I
mean,
it
is
different
now.
The
important
thing
is
that
you're
better.
And
that
you're
coming
home
soon,
right?
Okay,
Dad,
I
don't
want
you
to
freak
out,
but
I'm
going
to
a
medical
center
What?
No,
no,
you're
not.
What
are
you...
You
said
you
were
better.
I
am.
No,
Bella.
I'm
getting
on
a
plane.
No.
No.
It's
really
more
of
a
spa.
And
I'm
sure
that
I'd
be
better
Bells...
I
don't
know.
Dad,
don't
come.
And
picture
me
healthy,
like
I'm
sitting
on
the
couch
with
you,
You
want
me
to
visualize?
They
say
that
it
helps.
Just
picture
me
like
that.
Like
I
was.
It'll
make
me
feel
better.
Dad,
I
got
to
go,
okay?
Bella.
I
love
you.
Bella...

I'm
sorry
I've
been
so
angry.

I
would
be,
too.
I've
left
you
alone
in
this.
Marriage.
Well,
they
say
the
first
year
is
the
hardest.
Who
was
that?
What?
I
thought
I
just
heard...
Just
say
something
else.
Like
what?

Edward,
what's
going
on?
He
likes
the
sound
of
your
voice.
You
can
hear
him?
In
mind.
He
likes
my
voice
as
well.
What?
What
do
you
hear?
It's
so
strange.
I
thought
he
was
like
me,
but
he's
not.
Good
and
pure.
He's
happy.
Of
course
you
are.
Of
course
you're
happy.
I
love
you
so
much.
What
do
you
hear
now?
He
loves
you,
Bella.
Oh,
my
gosh.

Jacob.
So,
that's
the
last
of
it?
Bella
could
deliver
as
early
as
tomorrow.
If
she's
going
to
have
any
chance
at
all,
And
you
need
to
feed.
You
have
to
be
at
your
strongest
for
her.
Carlisle,
you're
the
enemy
now.
Sam
won't
hesitate.
You
will
be
slaughtered.
Emmett
will
come
with
us.
-
That
won't
be
enough.
If
there's
anything
we
can
do
to
save
her,
-
You'd
risk
your
lives
for
her?
Bella's
a
part
of
our
family
now.
Yeah.
I
can
see
that.
This
really
is
a
family.
As
strong
as
the
one
I
was
born
into.
I
know
what
I
have
to
do.
SETH:
Jake!
They're
coming.
I
know.
We
should
phase,
Jacob.
They'll
see
it
as
a
threat.
I
wanna
talk!
Be
easier
if
I
could
hear
you,
too.

This
isn't
your
territory
anymore.
-
How's
the
new
family
working
out?
You
coming
home,
Jake?
Not
until
I
finish
this.
What
do
you
mean?
I
want
Sam
to
take
back
Leah
and
Seth.
LEAH:
What?
Quiet!
I
want
them
safe.
And
I
want
this
over.

I
need
Sam
to
wait
until
Bella's
You
mean
till
she's
dead.
Ease
up,
Paul.
Then
what?
Tell
Sam
that
when
the
moment
comes,
Jake!
I'm
the
only
one
who
can.
They
trust
me.





-


You
played
us?
Can't
we
come
up
with
something
Thank
you.
-
They
make
it
out
all
right?
Good.
Hey.
Are
you
okay?
Yeah,
it's
not
like
I'm
the
one
This
is
pretty
important,
Bella.
Why
don't
you
tell
Jacob
What
now?
Rose
is
trying
to
talk
Bella
She
hates
them.
Well,
then
I'm
on
your
side
They're
not
that
bad.
If
it's
a
boy,
EJ.
Edward
Jacob.
Okay,
fine,
that
one's
not
awful.
Why
don't
you
tell
him
the
girl's
name?
I
was
playing
around
with
our
moms'
names.
Renée
and
Esme.
And
I
was
thinking...
Renesmee.

Too
weird?
No,
that's
not
too
weird.
It's
beautiful.
And
it's
unique,
I
like
Renesmee.
He
likes
it.

Rosalie,
pass
the
morphine.

Carlisle
said
the
placenta

-
He's
coming
as
fast
as
he
can,
but...
Rose!
Let
the
morphine
spread.
There's
no
time.
He's
dying.
Get
him
out
now!
Look
at
me,
Bella.

JACOB:
Rosalie,
don't!

Alice,
get
her
out
of
here!
BELLA:

Rosalie!
Ow!

Save
her!
You've
got
to
change
her!
I
can't,
not
whilst
he's
still
in
there.
I
got
to
get
him
out
first.
Stay,
Bella.
Stay
focused.
No!
He's
suffocating!

EDWARD:
Okay.


EDWARD:
Hey.
Hey,
hey.
It's
Renesmee.

You're
beautiful.


Hey.
JACOB:
Bella?
Bella?
Bella!
Jacob,
take
the
baby.
Keep
that
away
from
me!
Edward.
I'll
take
her.
I
promise
I'm
okay.
Let
me.
What
is
that?
It's
my
venom.

You're
okay.
Come
on.
It's
supposed
to
be
working.
JACOB:
Oh,
my
God.
Come
on.
Bella,
come
on.
I
won't
kill
you.
That'd
be
too
easy.
You
deserve
to
live
with
this.

She
didn't
make
it.
EDWARD:
You're
not
dead.
You're
not
dead.
Come
on!
No,
it
will
work.
It
will
work.
Please,
please,
please,
please.

Come
back
to
me,
please,
baby.
Bella,
Bella,
please,
please.

Hi,
hi.
I
don't
care
what
he's
done.
-
He's
still
my
son.
I
just
thought
you
should
know.
Bella's
dead.
It
killed
her.
Let's
go!

JACOB:
It's
like
gravity.
Your
whole
center
shifts.
Suddenly,
it's
not
the
Earth
You
would
do
anything,
A
friend,
a
brother.
A
protector.

Alice!
Jasper!
You're
gonna
be
all
right.
-
We're
outnumbered.
I
won't
let
them
hurt
my
family.






Stop!
It's
over!
If
you
kill
her,
you
kill
me.
Jacob
imprinted.
They
can't
hurt
her.
Whoever
a
wolf
imprints
on
can't
be
harmed.
It's
their
most
absolute
law.
EDWARD:
She
shouldn't
be
this
still.
CARLISLE:
It's
the
morphine.
EDWARD:
Maybe
I
was
too
late.
Listen
to
her
heart.







Sitting
pretty
uptightly
The
knots
keep
you
at
my
side
Upstairs,
in
corners
Eyes
blink
for
the
crawl
Up
and
out
If
yours
is
taken
Four
more
lines
Sellotape
an
end
to
Sellotape
an
end
Hover
thought
Bite
down
My
fickle
hands
machine
Sellotape
an
end
to
a
story
that
is
hanging
Over
silence
always
wasted
Swells
with
every
teardrop
Pulls
my
threads
to
kid
gloves
Sellotape
an
end
to
this

Now
I'm
the
guilty
one
Hey!
Give
me
my
sentence
I'll
pay
my
penance
Let
me
kill
them
all
And
the
pain
I
have
for
hurting
you
I
didn't
mean
it
Ah.
It's
from
Carlisle.
Which
is
spelt
with
an
"S,"
Sweet
Bianca.
He's
added
a
new
member
to
his
coven.
Ah.
Increasing
his
power.

First
it's
the
spelling,
then
the
grammar.
At
least
our
dispute
with
the
Cullens
is
over.
-
Over?
Goodness,
no.
Our
dispute
goes
far
beyond
And
what
might
it
be?
Why,
brother,
I
thought
you
understood.
They
have
something
I
want.

If
you
ever
leave
me,
baby
Leave
some
morphine
at
my
door
'Cause
it
would
take
To
realize
what
we
used
to
have,
There's
no
religion
that
could
save
me
No
matter
how
long
So
keep
in
mind
all
the
sacrifices
I'm
making
Will
keep
you
by
my
side
'Cause
there'll
be
no
sunlight
If
I
lose
you,
baby
There'll
be
no
clear
skies
If
I
lose
you,
baby
Just
like
the
clouds,
If
you
walk
away
Every
day
it
will
rain,
rain,
rain
I'll
never
be
your
mother's
favorite
Your
daddy
can't
even
look
me
in
the
eye
If
I
was
in
their
shoes,
Saying
there
goes
my
little
girl
Walking
with
that
troublesome
guy
But
they're
just
afraid
But
little
darling,
Yeah,
for
you
I'll
try,
I'll
try,
I'll
try,
I'll
try
I'll
pick
up
these
broken
pieces
If
that'll
make
you
mine
'Cause
there'll
be
no
sunlight
If
I
lose
you,
baby
There'll
be
no
clear
skies
If
I
lose
you,
baby
Just
like
the
clouds,
If
you
walk
away
Every
day
it
will
rain,
rain,
rain
Don't
just
say
goodbye
I'll
pick
up
these
broken
pieces
If
that'll
make
it
right
'Cause
there'll
be
no
sunlight
If
I
lose
you,
baby
There'll
be
no
clear
skies
If
I
lose
you,
baby
Just
like
the
clouds,
If
you
walk
away
Every
day
it
will
rain,
rain,
rain

Heart
beats
fast
Colors
and
promises
How
to
be
brave
How
can
I
love
when
I'm
afraid
To
fall
But
watching
you
stand
alone
All
of
my
doubt
Suddenly
goes
away
somehow
One
step
closer
I
have
died
every
day
waiting
for
you
Darling,
don't
be
afraid
For
a
thousand
years
I'll
love
you
for
a
thousand
more
Time
stands
still
Beauty
in
all
she
is
I
will
be
brave
I
will
not
let
anything
take
away
What's
standing
in
front
of
me
Every
breath
Every
hour
has
come
to
this
One
step
closer
I
have
died
every
day
waiting
for
you
Darling,
don't
be
afraid
For
a
thousand
years
I'll
love
you
for
a
thousand
more
And
all
along
I
believed
I
would
find
you
Time
has
brought
your
heart
to
me
For
a
thousand
years
I'll
love
you
for
a
thousand
more
One
step
closer
I
have
died
every
day
waiting
for
you
Darling,
don't
be
afraid
For
a
thousand
years
I'll
love
you
for
a
thousand
more
And
all
along
I
believed
I
would
find
you
Time
has
brought
your
heart
to
me
For
a
thousand
years
I'll
love
you
for
a
thousand
more
