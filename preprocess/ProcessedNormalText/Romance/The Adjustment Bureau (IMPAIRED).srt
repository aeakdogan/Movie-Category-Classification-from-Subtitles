ANNOUNCER:
Let's
welcome
and
the
next
senator
from
David
Norris!
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Well,
hi,
there.
My
name
is
David
Norris,
and
I'd
like
to
be
the
next
senator
Look
at
you.
What's
your
name?
I'm
going
to
go
through
and
take
the
city
that
way.
We
love
you.
The
recent
endorsement
by
is
another
boost
to
Norris
who
already
had
a
six-point
lead
over
his
opponent,
Roger
Linfield.
Whenever
I
see
you
on
I
always
think
you're
Congressman,

have
you
up
10
points.
DAVID:
We're
10
points
up?
This
is
not
going
to
I
have
some
real
opposition,
and
what
they're
saying
about
me
is
that
I'm
too
young
Win
big,
but
run
like
you're
20
down.
Okay,
you
got
it.
Thank
you,
Gary.
DAVID:
But
that's
okay
because
who
say
that
young
people
don't
vote,
young
people
don't
care
about
politics,
but
I'm
here
to
tell
you,
your
future
is
about
So,
today
I'd
like
to
put
them
on
notice
because
come
November,
that
it
was
young
people
like
you,
who
kicked
their
asses.

SPECTATORS:

David!
David!
Thank
you.
Charlie.
What's
wrong?


Yeah?
RICHARDSON:
Any
ideas?
I'm
working
on
it.
Keep
me
posted.
Yeah.
NEWSCASTER:
David
Norris,
until
recently,
he
was
Mary
Matalin
and
James
Mary,
this
is
a
surprise.
MARY:
It
is
a
surprise.
This
compelling
story,
he
grew
up
He
overcame
the
loss
his
mom
and
his
brother
when
he
was
10,
his
father
before
he
got
to
He
had
such
promise.
And
he
was
the
youngest
person
ever
elected
to
the
JAMES:
Yeah,
he
was
elected
but
he

in
a
bar
room
fight
I
like
this,
all
right.
Then
you
have
this
photo
I
think
the
accretion
of
this
stuff
was
just
too
much
for
the
voters.
It
reeked
of
some
level
of
impulsiveness.
MARY:
People
want
maturity,
RICHARDSON:
Big
night
for
us,
gentlemen.
Everybody
ready?
You
look
exhausted.
You
should
take
a
vacation
You've
earned
it.
I'm
not
sure
the
kind
of
tired
I
am
can
be
fixed
by
a
vacation.
Everybody
needs
a
vacation,
even
us.
All
right,
let's
get
him
back
on
track.
NEWSCASTER:
Mary,

since
the
photo
came
out,
Why
are
you
still
watching
CNN?

It's
going
to
be

out.

I'm

not
it's

you
do
when
you
get
back
up.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
I'm
I
will
get
back
up.

But
tonight
is
not
about
me.
It
is
about
coming
together
and
welcoming
the
newest
senator
for
the
great
state
of
New
York,
Roger
Linfield.

ELISE:
Shit!
Shit,
shit,
shit.
Hello?
It's
the
men's.
Yep.
Sorry
about
that.
I
I
just
didn't
know
what
to
do.
I
heard
you
come
in
and
say,
"Hello,"
and
I
probably
should
have
said,
"Hi,"
but
then
I
thought
that
would
be
weird
because
it's
the
men's.
Then
you
started
talking
to
yourself
and
it
was
obviously
very
personal.
So
I
was
stuck
in
no
man's
land,
and
then
it
all
got
to
be
What
are
you
doing
in
here?

Just...
I'm
hiding
from
security.

Why?
I
crashed
a

People
still
do
that?
It
was
a
dare.
Who
dared
you
to
crash
a
wedding?
Me.
Oh.
I
crashed
a

once.
Did
you?
Yeah,
in

school.
Oh.
But
I
got
caught.

think
that

no.

It
was

moment
Really?
I
could
have
used

on

of

ago.
I
could

gets

Really?
Yeah,
I

I'm
mostly
to

I
don't

I
think

love

You

you

You
would
have

to

you
would
have

you
would
have

at

10
minutes
later
than
you
did,
and
we
would
have

We

for

we

You
don't

There
is

to

So,
if

You
sure
you're
okay?
Yeah,
you?
I'm
great,
why?
You
don't
have
a
headache
or
anything?
No,
I
feel
fantastic,
man.
Is
it
me
or
this
an
odd
conversation?

You're
opposed
to
this
anyway,
CHARLIE:
Whoa,
whoa.
I
know
it's
a
risk,
but
if
our
company
doesn't
take
a
chance
I
mean,
I'm
willing
to
take
a
fire
on
Not
to
mention,

incredibly
lucrative.
David?
Yeah,
I
mean,
it's
why
CHARLIE:
All
right.
Let's
do
it.
Come
into
my
office
for
a
second.
Something
is
wrong.
A
couple
of
hours
ago

lost
her
number.
What?
The
woman
on
the
bus.
I
lost
her
phone
number
and
all
I'm
never
going
to
see
her
again.
I'm
sorry.
Wow,
I'm
really
sorry.
HARRY:
Your
entire
world
and
you're
thinking
about
a
woman.
Even
if
you
could
remember
the
number,
you'll
never
get
through.
Lost
cell
phone,
changed
numbers,
whatever
creates
the
fewest
ripples.
My
name
is
Harry,
by
the
way.
The
fewest
ripples?
You
freeze
people.
You
froze
my
friend.
We
need
special
authorization
to...
Poke
around
in
people's
brains.
You
make
them
think
whatever
you
want...
Be
quiet,
David.
Can
I
get
you
something?
Just
some
water,
please.
Your
friend
will
be
fine.
Recalibrations
make
tiny
It
doesn't
work
on
That's
too
intrusive.
You
said

The
Chairman.
The
Chairman?

That's
just
a
name
we
use.
You
use
many
other
names.
We
can't
talk
here.
Meet
me
on
the

If
you
reveal
us,
even
I
know.
You'll
bump
me
on
the
head.

mean

me?
Try

to
forget
it.

Ask
your
questions,
What
were
they
doing
to
Charlie?
Just
changing
the
way
he
which
will
subtly
shift
the
direction
So,
Richardson
could
read
my
mind?
Richardson
was
trying
to
scare
you.
No,
he
knew
the
number
I
Because
he
set
it
up
as
a
choice.
"Choose
a
color,
choose
a
number."
We
can't
read
your
mind
When
you
make
a
decision,
We
can
perceive
them.
We
know
when
you're
going
to
if
we're
close
enough,
we
can
sense
when
it's
going
to
happen.
We're
just
here
to
keep
you
on
plan.
That's
all
we're
authorized
to
do.
Are
you
allowed
to
be
Are
they
following
me
now?
We

is
something
about

It
blocks

We've
been

We're

who
live
a
lot
longer
than
humans.
Why
are
you
helping
me?
I
have
my
reasons.
And
why
won't
they
let
me
be
with
Elise?
All
I
know
is
the
amount
keeping
you
from
her
is
You're
going
to
look
You
won't
find
her.
They'll
make
sure
of
it.
Even
if
they
weren't
trying
to
stop
you,
there
are
nine
million
You'll
never
find
her.
Forget
about
her.
Move
on
with
your
life.

Stop!
Stop
the
bus!
Elise?
Elise,
hi.
David.
You
know,
I
rode
the
M6
to
hoping
that
I'd
bump
into
you.

felt
like
someone

Hey,

It
doesn't

You
want
to
take
a
walk?
No.
We
have
a

to
catch
up
on.
I
don't
think
you
should
What
if
I
don't
like
you
I'll
take
my
chances.
Seriously,
my
number
hasn't
changed,
just
call
me
like
you
didn't
last
time.
Look,
if
you
take
a
walk
It's
been
years.
How
do

know
Do
you
have
a
nice

Would
it
matter
if
I
did?
Yeah.
So
you
don't

Okay,
it
wouldn't
matter
at
all.
So,

don't

MAN:

How
are
you
doing,

I'm
Thank
you.
Good
to
see
you.
If
you
were
married,
But

Now

No,

My
wallet
was
taken.
Come
on.
Why
else
would
I
fawn
three
years
ago
and
then
never
call
you?
Because,

don't

It's

Thank
you.
It's

I
guess.
DAVID:
What
do
you
mean?
Look.
What's
this?
If

A
kiss?
That's
all
it
takes?
A
real
kiss.
If
that
happens,
every
strong
enough
to
break
them
up
will
cause
ripples
over
your
limit.

I
think
that
everything

found

ELISE:
It's
a
shame.
David,
hate
to
interrupt.
Hi.
Hi,
nice
to
see
you
again,
Elise.
How
did
you
find
me?
Does
it
matter?
Nice
work.
CHARLIE:
There's
a
crowd
of
people

the

You're
announcing

I
know.
I
told
you

not
David,
what
the
hell?
Do
you
want
to
watch?
No.
I
can't,
I
have
to
go

rehearse.
Actually,
I
just
heard

Pier
17,
right
next
to
the
bridge.
Why
don't
we
just
postpone
it?
No,
David,
come
on,
you
can't
do
that.
Thank
you.
You
have
to
go.
Check.
David,
she's
rehearsing
so
close.
It'll
take
you
three
minutes
All
right.
Just
come

you're
done.
Keep
the
change.
Thank
you.
RICHARDSON:

have
to
go
home
and
change.
You're
so
late.
Your

wrangling
him
right
now.
Yeah,
I
know.
Shifting
her
rehearsal
to
Pier
17
was
a
genius
move.
We're
not
out
of
the
woods
yet.
Come
over
when
you're
done.

CHARLIE:
David.
Okay.
Sorry,

Doesn't
change
the
fact.
DAVID:
You
put
us
together
three
times.
That
wasn't
us,
that
was
just
chance.
Why
do
you
want
to
keep
us
apart?
Because
the
plan
says
so.
Then
you
misread
the
plan.
There
is
no
misreading
the
plan
Then
the
plan
is
wrong.
Do
you
know
who
wrote
it?
I
don't
care.
You
should.
You

If
I'm
not
supposed
to
be

It's
Donaldson.
He
has
no
idea
what
he's
up
against.

Let's
take
a
walk.
The
intense
chemistry
between
them,
the
constant
inflection
points,
and
the
kicker,
you
only
to
have
chance
Yeah,
all
that
seemed
a
little
much.
So,
I
asked
Burdensky
to
do
Have
you
been
in

before?
No,
of
course
not.
It
seems
like
David
were
meant
to
be
together
because
they
were

Wait,
what?
DONALDSON:
In
the
'70s
when

they
were
meant
to

What?
I'm
saying,
it
wasn't
your
fault.
They
were
meant
to
be
together.
What?
Were.
In
an
earlier
version
of

Actually,
a
dozen
earlier
versions.
I
always
wondered
how
that
she
was

How
could
a
plan
just
change
like
that?
I
don't
know.
It's

So,
we're
going

This
is
exciting.
It's

We're

So,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
We're
going
to

this

upstairs
to
someone
with

breaking
into
a

We're
going
to

Thompson.
Thompson?
When
he
was
in
the
"The
Hammer,"
yes.
He'll
crush
this
little
and
force
them
back
on
plan
again.
I
want
to
go
to
a
club.
Oh!
Why
ruin
a
really
nice
day?
Come
on.
No,
I
don't
dance.
Everyone
can
dance.
Well,
I've
been
told
that
Who
told
you

A
long
list
of

That's
gross.
You
know
what?
Let's
race
to
that

You

for
you.
I
win,
you

for
me.
On

If
you
like,
yeah.
This
is
serious.
What
are
the
rules?
There
are
no
rules.
Oh!
You
bastard!
Oh,
my
gosh!

You
challenged
me
in
those
shoes?
Okay,
fine.
I
can't.
You're
right.
These
are
the
wrong
You
said,
"No
rules."
I
avoided
them.
Ow!
You
said

had
trouble
feeling.
Great.

Definitely
don't

It's

childhood.
What
were
you
like
as
a
kid?
I've
spent
about
half
my
up
until
the
sixth
grade.
Wow.
Yeah,
that
was
when
my
within
a
month
of
each
other.
I'm
sorry.
No,
it's
fine.
You
know
how
I
always
tell
that
story
about
how
I
got
inspired
because
my
dad
took
me
and
we
sat
together
and
that's
true.
But
what
I
leave
out
is
he
did
that
right
after
they
died.
And
I
was
bottoming
out.
So,
he
wanted
to
get
me
out
and
he
planned
this
road
trip
to
DC,
and
I
think
it's
And
we
went
and
sat
in
the
gallery.
I
remember
watching
him
watch
them,
and
I
knew
that
that's
I
wish
they
were
here
to
see
all
this.
I
was...
Didn't
expect
to
tell
you
any
of
that.
David?
David?

Hello?
It's
Adrian.
Hey.

What
are
you
doing?
Why
are
you
calling?
Hi.
No,
I
was...
Because
I
was
sleeping.
No.
No,
it's
not.
Why
are
you
calling?
Okay,
well,
I
got
to
go.
No,
I
got
to
go.
Okay.
I'm
so
sorry.
It's
all
right.
Everything
okay?
Yeah.
Oh,
my
God.
That
was
so
weird.
I
woke
up
and
you
weren't
here.
And
then
the
phone
rang
and
it
was
my
ex
which
is
just
so
strange.
Sorry,
I
guess
we
hadn't
Right.
You
know,
we
broke
up
a
while
ago,
and
it's
over
and
then
he
He
called
you
four
times
this
morning?
Mmm-hmm.
How
long
have
you
guys
been
broken
up?
Um...
Three
months.
It's
like
he
knew
I
Was
it
serious?
We
were
engaged.
So,
not
really
that
serious?

Right.
Well,
what
happened?

Do
you
want
to
know
this?
Yeah.
He
was
a
great
guy.
Brilliant
choreographer
and
dancer,
and
we
had
the
same
group
of
friends.
We
had
known
each
other
a
long
time.
Well,
he
sounds
great.
Because
of
you.
I'm
not
some
hopeless
romantic.
I've
never
allowed
But
once
I
felt,
even
for
a
moment,
what
I
felt
with
you.
You
ruined
me.
I
didn't
I
know
the
feeling.
It
scares
the
shit
out
of
me.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
You
don't
need
to
say
that.
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
This
is
the
first
time
in
25
years
that
I
don't

That's
a
lot
I
don't
know
if
I'm
quite
Well,
too
late.
You
know,
I'm
supposed
to
What
if
I
told
you
I
wasn't
ready
Sounds
good.
You
want
to
go?
Yeah.
All
right.
Are
you
handsome
Are
you
handsome
or
is
it
that
Washington
I
don't
want
to
say,
DAVID:
This
is
getting
a
little
weird.

David
Norris,
everybody.

MAN:
Excuse
me,
ma'am.
Yes?
Congressman
Norris
asked
He
was
just
called
into
a
meeting.
He
says
it's
urgent.
Okay.
He
said
he'll
call
and
he'll
see
you
at
the
show
tonight.
Okay,
thank
you.
Thanks.
This
way,
Congressman.
Hello?
Frustrating,
isn't
it?
My
name
is
Thompson.
Whatever
happened
to
free
will?
We
actually
tried
free
will
before.
After
taking
you
from
to
the
height
of
the
Roman
Empire,
we
stepped
back
to
see
how
You
gave
us
the
Dark
until
finally
we
decided
The
Chairman
thought
that
maybe
with
teaching
you
how
to
ride
a
bike
before
taking
the
So,
we
gave
you
the
Renaissance,
the
Enlightenment,
For
600
years
we
taught
you
to
control
your
impulses
with
reason.
Then
in
1910,
we
stepped
back
again.
Within
50
years,
you
had
the
Depression,
Fascism,
the
Holocaust,
and
capped
it
off
by
to
the
brink
of
destruction
in
the
Cuban
missile
crisis.
At
that
point
a
decision
was
before
you
did
something
You
don't
have
free
will,
David.
You
have
the
appearance
of
free
will.
You
expect
me
to
believe
that?
I
make
decisions
every
day.
You
have
free
will
over
or
which
beverage
to
order
at
lunch.
But
humanity
just
isn't
mature
enough
to
control
the
important
things.
So,
you
handle
the
important
things?
The
last
time
I
checked,
the
It's
still
here.
If
we
had
left
things
in
Tell
me
why
I
can't
be
with
Elise?
Because
the
last
guy
didn't
know.
Meeting
Elise
at
the
Waldorf
That
was
us.
We
knew
she
would
inspire
That
speech
that
brought
you
and
overnight
made
you
the
What
are
you
saying?
You
This
one
and
four
more
after
it.
And
I'm
not
just
talking
You
can
matter,
David.
Really
matter.
What
your
father
wanted
when
he
when
you
were
10.
What
your
brother
wanted
the
day
before
he
overdosed
that
you
wouldn't
be
like
him.
Why
do
you
think
you
have
that
That
terrible
emptiness
when
you're
not.
Don't
do
that.
David,
you
can
change
the
world,
but
that
doesn't
happen
Why
do
you
people
care
who
I
love?
It's
not
about
her,
it's
about
you.
What
being
with
her
does
to
you.
What
it
does
to
me?
I'm
better
when
I'm
with
her!
Even
you
said
it.
The
speech.
In
small
doses,
Elise
was
the
cure.
But
in
large
doses,
she
rubs
off
on
you.
Stop.
David,
the
president
Stop
talking.
It's
not
working.
Why
do
you
refuse
to
accept
what
You've
seen
what
we
can
do.
You
can't
doubt
we
Look,
it's
not
about
who
Can't
outrun
your
fate,
David.
I
just
disagree
with
you
I
know
what
I
feel
for
her
All
I
have
are
the
choices
that
I
make.
And
I
choose
her
come
what
may.
It's
6:20.
If
you
leave
now,
you




She's
a
beautiful
dancer.
I
thought
I
made
myself
clear.
There
is
one
more
piece
to
I
guess
I
just
didn't
have
the
heart.
If
you
stay
with
her,
it
not
only
kills
your
What?
Elise
is
about
to
become
one
of
the
and
eventually
one
of
the
If
she
stays
with
you,
she
ends
up
teaching
When
you
look
back
at
all
this,
David,
just
remember
we
tried
to
reason
with
you.



I
always
hear
people
saying,
"You
can't
blame
yourself
for
but
in
this
case,
really,
you
can.
This
is
what
you
do,
David.
This
is
what
you
did
the
night
you
first
got
elected.
What
you
did
to
get
that
embarrassing
We
give
you
opportunities
and
you
squander
them
with
impulse.
It
doesn't
take
a
genius
to
see
Elise
isn't
exactly
helping
you
with
this.
It's
a
sprain,
David,
but
if
you
stay
with
her,
you'll
take
away
the
only
It's
up
to
you.
It's
just
a
sprain.
It's
just
a
sprain.
Yeah.
The
doctor
said
it's
going
to
That's
totally
unexpected.

I'm
so
relieved.
Great.
Great.
You're
such
a
great
dancer,
and
you'll
heal
up
and
I'm
going
to
go
make
Okay.
Okay.
I'm
so
happy
for
you.
RICHARDSON:
It's
done.
I
know.
You
can't
let
it
get
to
you
like
it
did
with
his
family.
This
is
the
job.
HARRY:
You
ever
wonder
if
it's
right?
I
mean,
if
it's
always
right?
RICHARDSON:
Not
like
I
used
to.
Look,
Chairman
has
the
plan.
We
only
see
part
of
it.
I
was
talking
to
some
friends
of
ours
and
I
said
something
a
lot
of
you
may
have
heard
me
David
Norris,
who
has
spent
the
last
two
received
some
welcome
news
yesterday
gave
him
a
16-point
less
than
a
month
before
election
day.
Since
his
announcement
11
months
ago,
Norris
has
had
a
significant
lead...
Hi.
Thanks.
Thanks
a
lot.
Yeah,
thank
you.
I
need
it.
Thank
you.
Who
should
I
make
it
out
There
you
go.
Thank
you
so
much.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
sure.
MAN:
Thank
you.
My
pleasure.
Pleasure.
MAN
2:
Can
we
get
a
picture
with
you?
DAVID:
Sure,
come
on.
Thank
you.
Thanks.
Hey.
I
want
to
show
you
this,
because
I
want
to
be
here
when
you
do.
She's
getting
married
to
You
okay?
I
think
I'm
going
to...
Take
a
day
off.
Hell,
take
a
couple.
We're
16
points
up.
Yeah,
even
I
can't
blow
a
lead
that
big.
BARTENDER:
Congressman,
Your
friend
just
left
you
this.
He
said
you
would
be
stopping
by.
Why
would
you
want
to
see
me?
Thompson
was
lying
when
he
said
you
couldn't
be
with
Elise
because
Then
why?
Why
do
they
care
so
much?
Because
she's
enough,
David.
If
you
have
her,
you
won't
need
to
fill
with
applause
and
votes
and
dreams
of
one
day
That's
important,
but
it's
not
Why
are
you
so
different
from
them?
Your
dad
was
a
very
smart
man.
He
could
have
been
a
Your
brother,
too.
But
the
plan
didn't
call
for
it.
What
about
my
mother?
That
wasn't
me.
That
wasn't
us
at
all.
It
was
just
chance?
I'm
sorry.
You
know,
Thompson
is
not
lying.
They're
already
talking
about
me
I'm
phoning
in
my
speeches
The
public
loves
you.
Before
I
met
Elise,
I
don't
even
notice
it
now.
I
can't
stop
thinking
about
her.
Do
you
know
where
she's
getting
married?
In
front
of
a
judge
tomorrow
morning.
Is
she
happy?
Thompson
won't
let
Not
tonight,
not
tomorrow,
not
ever.
Harry.
Is
she
happy?

I
got
to
try
and
get
her
back.
Will
you
help
me?
Will
you
They'll
sense
you
coming
a
mile
away.
What
if
I
could
move
as
fast
as
you?
Teach
me
about
the
doors.
HARRY:
The
rain
will
HARRY:
The
rain
will

that's
the
only
thing
keeping
If
we're
going
to
do
this,
and

place
surrounded
Always
turn
the
doorknob
clockwise.
What
happens
if
I
turn
it
the
other
way?
You
don't
want
to
do
Put
your
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
don't
let
go
until
Are
these
ever
locked?
Not
when
you're
wearing
one
of
our
hats.
Keep
moving,
David.
Is
this...
It's
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art.
Yeah.
Close
the
door.
This
is
the
city's
main

We're
10
blocks
from
the
courthouse.
Wait
here.
Hi,
is
the

open?
You
okay,
sweetie?
Yeah,
I
just...
I
just
feel
like
being

That's
what
we
call

Makes
it
a

more
complex
to

a

slower.
Your
destination,
60
Centre
There
are
thousands
of
different
ways
to
get
to
the
courthouse
I
want
you
to
learn
how
so
Thompson
won't
be
DAVID:
Okay.
Just
south
of
I
come
out
on
Broadway,
That's
good.
Keep
going.
From
Leonard,
half
a
block
down.
Okay,
suppose
Thompson's
there?
Okay,
I
go
east
to
Lafayette.
No,
it's
Crosby
Street
there.
Eight
doors?
I'm
zigzagging
That
will
take
me
too
long.
But
every
time
you
go
through
a

you
to

Assume
everyone

Even
you
guys
can't
get
through
the
Right.
It's
one
of
the
ways
the
Water
is
another
way.
And
you
said
before,
what
if
Thompson's
Right.
Why
don't
I
just
knock
and
then
run
by
him
before
That's
good,
improvisation.
DAVID:
The
fastest
way
is
actually
Yeah,
but
then
you're
That's
a
lot
more
dangerous
But
if
I
make
it,
I'll
take
If
you
make
it.
Come
on,

have
a

takes.
Your

to

that.
I
guess
you're
not
supposed
You're
not
supposed
to
feel
guilt.
We're
not
built
to

with

that
doesn't
mean
Some
more

others.

You're
lucky,

I'm

I
know
it
seems
terrible
You
don't
know
anything
about
me
and

makes
me
happy.
I'm
sorry
that
I
hurt
you.
Oh,
my
God.
Don't
worry
about
him,
he's
with
them.
Just
listen
to
me.
Oh,
Forget
about
him.
What

Okay,

Why

talking
about?

never
lied
to
you.

I
love
you,

I'm

What
the
hell
is
going
on,
David?
Okay,
I'm
sorry.
How
did
we
just
do
that?
I'm
so
sorry.
These
doors
belong
to
the
Who
are
they?
I
don't
but
they
want
to
take
you
away
from
me.
Why
do
they
care
about
us?
They
hurt
your
ankle,
Elise.
Everything
you've
worked
it
doesn't
happen
if
you
stay
with
me.
That's
why
I
left
you
in
the
hospital.
I
don't
understand.
I
don't
understand.
This
can't
be
wrong.
This
can't
be
wrong.
Why
do
they
think
it's
wrong?
The
book...
Their
book.
But
what
if
I
can
find
who
wrote
it?
Okay,
I
can
go
through
this
door
alone.
You'll
never
see
me

Or
you
could
come
with
me,
and
I

know
you
would
be
next
to
me,
and
that's
all
I've
wanted
I'm
coming
with
you.
Okay.
Take
the
other
one.
Turn
it
to
the
left.
To
the
left.
Oh,
my
God.

MAN:
Hey!
You
can't
be
in
here.
MAN
2:
Stop,
sir!
MAN
3:
Hold
them
up!
Come
on.
MAN
4:
Stop
them!
Harry
Mitchell,
they
want
Immediately.
Come
on.
Hey!
Hey!
How
did
you
get
in
here?
Search
the
room!
Shit!
Go
back.
No.
Oh,
my
God.
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
Did
you
really
think
you
And
change
your
fate
if
you
did?
Or
write
your
own?
It
doesn't
work
like
I've
got
a
message
for
you.
I
understand.
Even
Thompson
has
a
boss.
Harry?
You're
the
Chairman?

No.
You've
met
him
though,
or
her.
Everybody
has.
The
Chairman
comes
in
a
so
people
rarely
Is
this
some
sort
of
test?
In
a
way,
it's
all
a
test,
for
everybody,
even
the
members
David,
you
risked
everything
for
Elise.
And
Elise,
when
you
came
through
you
risked
everything,
too.
But
you
inspired
me.
It
seems
like
you
Is
that
about
us?
Yes.
What
does
it
say?
It
says
that
this
situation
is
a
serious
deviation
from
the
plan.
So,
the
Chairman
rewrote
it.
Okay.
Now
what?
Now...
You
can
take
the
stairs.
HARRY:
Most
people
live
life
Too
afraid
to
explore
any
other.
But
once
in
a
while,
who
knock
down
all
the
People
who
realize
free
will
is
a
until
you
fight
for
it.
I
think
that's
the
Chairman's
real
plan
that
maybe
one
day
we
won't
write
the
plan.
You
will.
