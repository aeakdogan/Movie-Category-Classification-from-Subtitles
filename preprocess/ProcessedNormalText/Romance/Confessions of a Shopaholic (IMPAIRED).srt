When
I
was
a
little
girl,
there
were
real
prices
and
mom
prices.
Real
prices
got
you
shiny,
and
mom
prices
got
you
brown
things...
...
that
lasted
forever.
You
notice
they
were
50
percent
off?
-
Look
at...

But
when
I
looked
I
saw
another
world.
A
dreamy
world
A
world
where
grown-up
girls

They
were
beautiful.
Like
fairies
or
princesses.
They
didn't
even
need
any
money,
I
wanted
one.
Little
did
I
know...
...
I
would
end
up
with
12.

Bloomwood.
Jacket:
Visa.
Dress:
AMEX.
Belt:
MasterCard.
It's
vintage.
And
I
got
Bag:
Gucci!
And
worth
every
penny.
Moving
to
New
York,
I
met
guys.
And
that
kind
of
put
things
'Cause
you
know
that
thing,
when
you
see
and
your
heart
kind
of
goes
like
warm
butter
Well,
that's
what
it's
like
Only
it's
better.

You
see,
or
treat
you
as
well
as
a
store.
If
a
man
doesn't
fit,
you
can't
for
a
gorgeous
cashmere
sweater.
And
a
store
always
smells
good.
A
store
can
awaken
a
lust
for
things
you
never
even
knew
you
needed.
And
when
your
fingers
grasp

Oh,
yes!
Oh,
yes!
Oh,
no...
I
spent
$900.
So
you
are
covering
-
I'm
on
it.

OK,
don't
panic.
Calm.
Calm.
Bloomingdale's.
Well,
that
would
be
the
pants.
I
had
to
get
the
pants
to
match
the...
-
Oh,
shoes.

Hold
on...
-
Somebody's
stolen
my
credit
card!
Somebody
has
stolen
on
an
insane
spending
spree
-
No!
Outdoor
World?
I've
never
been
Yes,
you
have.
-
You
bought
that
tent,
remember?
-
For
Kristen's
going-away
present.
I
organized
the
collection
Oh...
"Special
skills:
Fencing"?

What?
Shoe!
Thanks.
Why
can't
you
get
changed
And
let
everyone
at
Gardening
Today
know
I've
secretly
arranged
Did
I
mention
I
have
Only
about
a
billion
times.
-
OK...
Gardening
to
fashion?
I
mean,
not
that
I
meant
Suze...
since
I
was
14
If
I
can
just
get
this
job
Wow.


Rebecca,
you
just
You
do
not
need
a
scarf.
Then
again...
...who
needs
a
scarf?
Wrap
some
old
jeans
around
That's
what
your
mother
would
do.
You're
right,
she
would.
The
point
about
this
scarf
is
that
it
would
become
part
Of
your
psyche.
Do
you
see
what
I
mean?
No,
I
do.
Keep
talking.
It
would
make
your
eyes
look
bigger.
Mmm...

It
would
make
my
haircut
You'd
wear
it
with
everything.
It
would
be
an
investment.
You
would
walk
into
-
Confident.
-
Poised.
The
green
scarf,
please.
Good
choice.
It's
the
last
one.
That'll
be
$120.
Here's
$50
in
cash,
Ten
on
that.
Twenty
on
that.
-
It's
so
cute.
Really?
Could
you
just...
-

-
Could
you
put
this
to
one
side?
-
Excuse
me.
It's
an
emergency.
Excuse
me,
this
is
an
emergency.
-
Do
you
do
cash
back?
If
I
give
you
a
check
for
$23,
one
of
your
hot
dogs
-
Do
I
look
like
a
bank?
They
don't
hold
items.
Desperately
important
scarf.
Know
what?
It's
for
my
great-aunt.
Can
you
ask
them
Want
mustard
with
that?
Please.
I
will
buy
all
of
your
hot
dogs.
-
You'll
take
97
hot
dogs?
Who
do
I
make
it...
That
means
you
just
paid
You
want
your
scarf,
I
want
my
hot
dog.
Cost
and
worth
Thank
you!
My
aunt
-
Hi.
I'm
here
for
the
interview
Alette...
Oh,
filled,
internally.
They
did
post
it
on
the
Web.
Oh...

Alicia...
Billington.
She
has
the
longest
legs
in
the
world.
She
notes
resentfully.
Great.

Faulty.
-
Nice
scarf.
Scusi...
As
we
speak,
interviews
are
being
held
at
Successful
Saving.
-
The
money
magazine?
Alette
may
be
your
Emerald
City,
but
Successful
Saving
Dantay-West
is
a
family
of
magazines
Deeply
nepotistic.
Ugh.
So
my
advice
to
you,
dear
Dorothy,
is
thus...
I'm
in.
-


Ms.
Bloomwood?
So
what
form
does
this
interview
take?
Is
it
just
mainly
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Butterfly
investments,
futures.
-
But
he's
worth
1.2
billion...
-
Thanks.
Yeah,
of
course
I
did.
It's
always...
Listen,
I've
got
to
go.
Mm-mm.
Sorry
about
that.
-
Ah!
We
met!
Sick
aunt,
scarf.
Yep.
I
did.
And
when
a
stranger
-
Wow.
-
Do
you
have
a
resume
for
me?
Ah...

I...
could
pretty
much
just
tell
you.
My
name
is
Rebecca
Bloomwood,
I've
been
a
journalist
for
five
years.
I'm
very
comfortable
juggling
numbers,
I
speak
fluent
Finnish,
I
know...
-
Finnish?
-
I'm
also...
What's
behind
you?
-
Um...
Oh,
it's
a
naked
man.
Oh,
sorry.
It
gave
me
such
a
fright.
I,
uh...
I
didn't
know
what
it
was.
Who
would
do
that
to
him?

Well,
a
few
questions.
But,
look!
Makes
you
wonder
what
they're
looking
at
You
could
turn
your
desk
around
I
would.

-
Not.
I'm
not
a
pervert.
Sit
down.
I'm
sorry,
I'm
terrible
at
interviews.
Any
financial
stories
that
have
Yes.
And
I
am
glad
Because
I
am
furious.
No,
I
mean,
what
is
the
story
Fish
crisis?
-
Fiscal...
crisis.
-
Terrifying.
Fiscally,
I
mean.
-
For
the
fiscal
family.
-
Not
a
moment
too
soon.
She
died.
Oh,
Ms.
Bloomwood,
you
have
had
I'm
glad
you
understand!
OK,
so
I
would
propose
we
curtail...
Did
you
just
scrub
my
name
off?
-
Oh,
no.
Routine.
OK,
I'm
gonna
propose
that
So
I'll
leave
you
and
your
numbers,
but
thank
you
very
much
for
seeing
me,
and
I
appreciate...
Oh!

I
appreciate
everything.
Good
day.
Come
on.

Well,

No,

I
felt
sorry
for

didn't

I
can't

about

one.

they

mail.

Oh,
God...
How
are
you
going
to
pay
off

62

I
could
win
the
lottery.
Maybe
you
should
have
a
backup
plan.
Oh!
Backup
plan,
I
got
it,
I
got
it.
OK.
When
Tarkie

um,
wrote

You

No.

wanted

Not

call

angle.

No,

don't.

company?
Yes.
Absolutely.
This
year
has
been
a
year
in
the
communications
industry.

pal.
Not

after.

Twenty-four.
Million.

Million
dollars...
...while

As
I
said,
I'll
be
happy
Is
that
true?
A
long
pause
and
no
answer.
-
Long
pause,
no
answer.
OK.

know
why
we
did
that?

kind
of
cruel

to

if

right
questions,

isn't

to

You
know,
I've
always
felt
that
spidery
long

were
vastly
overrated.
I
thought
she

No.
She's

She's

doesn't
know
it
yet,

Speak

Good
morning.

Hi.
Am

Me?

asked
me
to

Oh,

I'm
sorry,
excuse
me,
but,
Rebecca,
Derek
Smeath
is
here.
God.
Um...
I,
uh...
Rebecca
is
being
stalked.

So
exciting
I've
had
enough
of
this
clown.
Whoa!
Luke!
No!
Don't
worry.
See?
She
called
security.
Voil.
Shall
we
go?
Mmm?
No.
No,
no,
no,
no.
This
is
outrageous!
So
after
the
ball,
I,
myself,
actually
read
Successful
Saving.
I
have
been
observing
you
and
it
seems
you
have
but...
do
you
have
genuine
style?
Dressing
is
like
any
It
is
an
art,
but
also
a
challenge.
Bonjour.
This
dress
is
good
for
you,
huh?
With
maybe...
this
jacket
over.
Oh,
that's
genius,
Alette.
Parfait.
I
think
that
is
a
great
dress,
...a
little
more...
...of
something...
like
this?
I
mean,
I'd
pair
it
with
Show
me.
So,
Rebecca,
hmm.
Take
her
bag.
You
are
sure
of
your
choice?
-
Yeah.


Do
not
answer
Do
not
answer
this
call,
Do
not
answer
Hello.
Ah,
yes.
Is
perfect.
So,
unfortunately,
I
cannot
stay.
But
I
am
looking
forward
-
for
your
TV
debut.
Hmm?
Goodbye.
-
Oh,
God.
Pretty
much
my
entire
Mmm.
But
isn't
it
worth
it?
OK,
no
peeking.
Don't
peek.
Now
turn
this
way.
OK,
don't
peek.
Oh,
and
look,
look,
look!
-
Do
you
love
it?
Oh,
Bex.
This
is
so
exciting.
I'm
getting
married
and
you're
getting
to
Alette,
and...
What's
in
that
bag?
Oh,
that's
just
a
dress
for
the
TV
show.
Mom,
can
you
go
get
a
cupcake?
How
much
did
it
cost?
Alette
gets
an
incredible
discount.
Still
going
to
Shopaholics
Anonymous?
Yes!
-
'Cause
you
promised.
Oh,
excuse
me.
Are
you
going
Yes.
Could
you
do
me
a
favor
Doesn't
look
good
entering
carrying
a
Barneys
bag.
Oh!
I
know
exactly
what
you
mean.
-
Leave
it
to
me.
-
Hey,
save
me
a
seat,
huh?
-

Thank
you!
My
name
is
Ms.
Korch.
I
do
things
differently.
Ms.
Bloomwood?
You're
willing
to
give
away
that
you
don't
need,
the
things
you
don't
need
But
here's
the
thing:
I'll
show
you
who
really
needs
them.
Steady!
Steady.
-
Oh,
my.
Colorful.
Please!
How
many
of
us
OK.
I
just
want
you
to
take
Ms.
Bloomwood,

My
will
is
strong.
My
wallet
is
closed.
Back
to
the
basement.
There's
been
a
mistake.
-
Hmm.
I
need
it
back.
Yes?
Can't
sell
those
two
dresses.
-
No
returns.
I'd
bring
back
something
tomorrow.
-
Something
better.
-
OK,
so,
um,
I'll
buy
'em.
Oh,
really.
-
OK.
How
much?
What?
How
is
this
a
charity
store?
This
is
from
Barneys.
I
know.
OK,
-
This
one's

Which
is
more
important?

hasn't?
Oh!
Tarkie,

This
is
her?
The

Oh,
she
looks
like
an
expert.
Hey,
Janice.
She's
in
the...
...
finance.
Not
my
thing.
-
Jane.
-
Janey.
Janey!
...
then
I
read
your
"Wow.
I
get
it."
Right.
Which
is
exactly
the
point.
Because
so
much
-
Is
really
boring.
Yes!
Go,
Bex!
It's
not
accessible.
But
it's
ordinary
people
that
have
It
is.
It's
people
like
my
mom
and
dad.
Ow!
Tell
us
about
the
coat.
about
the
cashmere
coat
and
worth.

Well,
that's
you.

the

Essentially,
something
but
it's
actually
the
most

And
that's...
Trust.
I'm
loving
you
guys.
Who
knew
that
debt
But
we
just
have
a
little
bit
more
time.
We
wanna
get
questions
Is
there
anybody
out
there
with
any
financial
issues
Yes,
you,
sir.
Well...
I'm
having
trouble
with
debt.
OK.
Mortgage
debt,
car
debt?
-
Ms.
Bloomwood's
debt.
That's
right.
I'm
from
the
All
City

My
name
is
Derek
Smeath.
Now,
look,
for
God's
sake,
has
been
stalking

Yes,
I
have.

credit

and
a
quarter.
-

No,
I'm
sorry,
Really?
No
wonder
she
didn't
bring
him
home.
That's
good.
I
tell
ya,
the
more
you
look
at
me,
OK,
well,
uh,
my
ex-girlfriend
told
me
she
couldn't
meet
me
today
because
I
might
risk
-
she
picked
up
in
Finland.

Know
she
was
part
Finnish?
-

Anybody
else
like
to
ask...
No,
no,
no.
Oh,

you

Well,
at
least
I
don't
have
to
worry
Luke,
you
don't
understand!
No,
you're
right,
I
don't!
So
do
what
I
hired
you
to
do,
Rebecca,
and
make
the
truth
clear
to
somebody
who
absolutely
I

Oh,
so
you
lie
because
you

-

-
Well,
I...
Well,
you're
not
giving
me
time...
For
what?
Just,
for
once
in
your
life,
Because
when
I
shop,
The
world
is
better.
And
then
it's
not
anymore.
Well,
what
about
honesty?
What
about
credibility?
Well,
I
wanted
to
tell
you,
but
I
only
took
the
job
Well,
I
wish
you
all
the
best
with
that.
Luke,
I'm
so
sorry.
No,
no.
I
understand.
That
absolutely
makes
sense.

Bloomwood
funny,
inspiring
woman
I
have
ever

And
she
lived
a
lie.
But
what
she
wrote
in
her
columns
She
had
a
voice.
She
spoke
to
people
that
they
could
understand,
they
found
that
they
could.
