The
party's
here
So,
what
did
you
think
of
the
film?
It
was
easily
better
than
which
me
thought
was
very
childish.
If
you
is
watching
this,
Potter,
You
probably
ain't
even
I
has
slept
with
three.
And
I
got
one
of
them
Whatever
you
thought
of
this
film,
cos
if
this
flops,
me
won't
be
able
So
the
choice
is
yours.
No
pressure.
Nan,
come
tell
them
about
it.
What?
You
is
fallen
over
again?
You
done
the
other
one
in
as
well?
Don't
cry
there,
all
mashed
up,
Me
will
get
you
the
cash
Don't
be
selfish.
Buy
the
merchandise
and
all.
