Good

l
come
about
a
very
serious
matter,
Brought
up
in
Houndslow.
Mother

l
should
think.
What
is
it
you
want,
Doolittle?
l
want
my

that's
what
l
want.
Of

you
do.
l'm
glad
to
see
you
have
a
spark
She's
in
there.
Yes,
take
her
away
at

What?
Take
her
away.
Do
you

going
Now,
is
this
reasonable,
Governor?
ls
it

to
take

The
girl

to
me.
You
got
'er.
How
dare
you
come
here
You
sent
her
here
on
purpose!
Don't
take
a
man
up
like
that,
Governor.
The
police
shall
take
you
up.

asked
you

leave
it

Well,
what
else
did
you
come
for?
What
would

'uman,

Alfred,
you
sent
her
here
on

So
help
me,
Governor,

never

How
did
you
know
she
was
here?
l'd
tell
you,

did
you
know
Eliza
was
here
Well,
she
sent
back
for
her
luggage
She
said
she
didn't
want
no
clothes.
What
was
l
to
think
from
that,
Governor?
So
you
came
here
to
rescue
her
-Yes,
sir,
Governor.
That's
right.
Mrs.
Pearce!
Eliza's
father
has
come
to
take
her
away.

Now

a
minute,

You
and
me

men
o'
the

we?
Men
of

we?
l

so
indeed,
sir!
ALFlE:
Here,

l've
took
a
sort
of
a
fancy
to
you

you're
a
straight
sort,
Governor.
So...
...what's
a
five
pound
note
to
you?
l
think
you
should
know,
Doolittle...
...that
Mr.
Higgins'
intentions
Of
course
they
are,
Governor.
You
mean,
you'd
sell
your
daughter
Have
you
no
morals,
man?
No,
l
can't
afford
'em,
Governor.
Neither
Not
that

any
'arm,
but...
...if
Eliza
is
gonna
have
a
bit
out
o'
this,
Why
not?
Look
at
it

What
am

money.

No,
you

the

Henry,
if
you

...then
you

potty
about
her.

you
to
give
up
...or
this
poor
girl
through
any
more.
lt's
the
most
fascinating
venture

BUTLER:
Good
evening,

famished.
MRS.
PEARCE:
Good
evening,


"When
she

me
in
"And
my
heart
went
on
"When
she
told
about
her
father
"And
l
never
saw
a
more
enchanting
farce
"Than
the
moment
when
she
shouted

sir?
Whom
shall

say

calling?
Freddy
Eynsford-Hill.
...tell
her

the
chap
Yes,
sir.
And

you

No,

you.

"Can
you
hear
a
lark
"Does
enchantment
pour
"No,
it's
just
on
the
street
where
you
live
"And,
oh,
the
towering
feeling
"Just
to
know
somehow
you
are
near
"The
overpowering
feeling
"That
any
second
you
may
suddenly
appear
"People
stop
and
stare,
"For
there's
nowhere

on
earth

by

MRS.
PEARCE:
Oh,
sir.
l'm
terribly
sorry,
sir.
Miss
Doolittle
says
she
doesn't
want
FREDDY:
But
why?
She
was
unbelievable.
So
l've
been
told,
sir.
Tell
her
that
l'll
wait.
But
it
might
be
days,
sir,
even
weeks.
But
don't
you
see?

be
happier
here.

really
is,
Higgins.
Do
you
realize
what
you've
got
to
teach
You've
got
to
teach
her
to
walk,
talk,
...a
bishop,
an
ambassador.
Higgins,
l'm
trying
to
tell
you
l
know
you're
a
stubborn
man,
but
so
am
l.
This
experiment
is
over.
And
nothing
short
of
an
order
Excuse
me.
You
understand,
Higgins?
lt's
over.
Higgins,
if
there's
any
mishap
...if
Miss
Doolittle
suffers
...it'll
be

the
ball,
Pickering.
PlCKERlNG:
Think
of
how
agonizing
lf
anything
happened
tonight,
You
could
always
rejoin
your
regiment.
This
is
no
time
for
flippancy,
Higgins.
The
way
you've
driven
her
...has
exceeded
all
bounds
For
God's
sake,
stop
pacing.
Have
some
port.
lt'll
quieten
your
nerves.
l'm
not
nervous.
-Where
is
it?
The
car's
here,
sir.
Good.
Tell
Miss
Doolittle.
Tell
Miss
Doolittle
indeed.
l
warned
you
about
these
French
designers.
We
should've
gone
to
an
English
shop.

a
glass
of
port?
Are
you
so
sure
this
girl
will
retain
Well,
we
shall
see.
PlCKERlNG:
Suppose
she
doesn't?
l
lose
my
bet.
PlCKERlNG:
There's
one
thing
l
can't
stand
At
a
moment
like
this,
...it's
utterly
indecent
And
what
about
the
girl?
You
act
Rubbish,
Pickering.
Of
course
she
matters.
What
do
you
think
l've
been
doing
What
could
possibly
matter
more
...and
change
her
into
a
different
human
lt's
filling
up
the
deepest
gap
...and
soul
from

Oh,
she
matters
immensely.

Miss
Doolittle,
you
look
beautiful.
Thank
you,
Colonel
Pickering.
Don't
you
think
so,
Higgins?
HENRY:
Not
bad.
Not
bad
at
all.

Maestro!
Maestro!
Don't

No.

He

so
villainously

PlCKERlNG:
Absolutely

HENRY:
A

of
tomfoolery.
PlCKERlNG:
Well,
Mr.
Higgins?
A
triumph,
Mrs.
Pearce.
A
total
triumph.
Higgins,
you
were
superb,
Tell
us
the
truth
now,
weren't
you
Not
during
the
whole
evening?
Not
when

going
to

felt
like
a
bear
in
a
cage
hanging
about.

was
an
immense
achievement.

myself
to

her
the

provocation.

she

You!

afternoon,
Professor

you

You
are

on

mean.

her

first.

Henry,

The
bishop
is
here.
The
bishop

the

should

him
in

Eliza,
if
my
son
starts
breaking
up
things...
...l
give
you
full
permission
Henry,
l
suggest
you
stick
to
two
subjects:
You've
had
a
bit
of
your
own
back,
Have
you
had
enough
and
will
you
You
want
me
back
to
pick
up
...and
put
up
with
your
tempers
l
didn't
say
l
wanted
you
back
at
all.
Then
what
are
we
talking
about?
Well,
about
you,
not
about
me.
lf
you
come
back
you'll
be
treated
l
can't
change
my
nature
or
my
manners.
My
manners
are
exactly
That's
not
true.
He
treats
a
flower
girl
l
treat
a
duchess
l
see.
The
same
to
everybody.
The
great
secret
is
not
a
question
...or
bad
manners
...but
having
the
same
manner
The
question
is
not
...but
whether
you've
ever
heard
me
l
don't
care
how
you
treat
me.
l
don't
mind
your
swearing
at
me.
l've
had
one
before
this.
Get
out
of
my
way,
You
talk
about
me
as
though
So
you
are
a
motorbus.
All

go
But
l
can
get

without
you.

know
you
can.
l
told
you,
you
could.
You've
never
wondered,
l
suppose,
...whether
l
could
get
along
without
you?
Don't
you
try
to
get
around
me.
So
l
can,
without
you
or
any
soul
on
earth.
l
shall
miss
you,
Eliza.
l've
learned
l
confess
that
humbly
and
gratefully.
Well,
you
have
my
voice
When
you
feel
lonely
without
me
you
can

Well,
l
can't
turn
your
soul
on.
You
are
a
devil!
You
can
twist
the
heart
in
a
girl
...as
some
can
twist
her
arms
to
hurt
her.
What
am
l
to
come
back
for?
For
the
fun
of
it.
That's
why
l
took
you
on.
You
may
throw
me
out
tomorrow
Yes.
And
you
may
walk
out
tomorrow
And
live
with
my
father?
Yes,
or
sell
flowers.
l
wouldn't
marry
you
if
you
asked
me
-Than
he
is.
That's
not
what
l
want
l've
always
had
chaps
enough
Freddy
Hill
writes
me
twice
ln
short,
you
want
me
to
be
No,
l
don't.
That's
not
the
sort
of
feeling
l
want
a
little
kindness.
l
know
l'm
a
common,
ignorant
girl,
...but
l'm
not
dirt
under
your
feet.
What
l
done...what
l
did
was
not
...but
because
we
were
pleasant
together
...to
care
for
you.
Not
to
want
you
to
make
love
to
me...
...and
not
forgetting
the
difference
...more
friendly
like.
Well,
of
course.
That's
how
l
feel.
And
how
Pickering
feels.
That's
not
the
proper
answer.
lt's
the
only
answer
To
be
a
lady,
you
must
stop
...if
men
don't
spend
half
their
time
...and
the
other
half
giving
you
black
eyes.
You
find
me
cold,
unfeeling,
selfish,
Off
with
you
to
the
sort
of
people
you
like.
Marry
a
sentimental
hog
...and
thick
lips
to
kiss
you,
lf
you
can't
appreciate
what
you
have,
l
can't
talk
to
you.
l'm
always
in
the
wrong.
Don't
be
too
sure
you
have
me
...to
be
trampled
on
and
talked
down.
l'll
marry
Freddy,
l
will,
Freddy!
The
poor
devil
who
couldn't
get
a
job
...even
if
he
had
the
guts
to
try?
Don't
you
understand?
Freddy
loves
me.
l
don't
want
him
to
work.
l'll
go
and
be
a
teacher.
What'll
you
teach,
in
heaven's
name?
What
you
taught
me.
l'll
teach
