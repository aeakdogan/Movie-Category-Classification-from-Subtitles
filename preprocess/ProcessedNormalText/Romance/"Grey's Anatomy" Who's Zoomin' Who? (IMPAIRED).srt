You
know
how
when
you
were

That
fantasy
of
what
your
life
would
be.
White
dress,
Prince
Charming,
who'd
carry
you
away
You'd
lie
in
bed
at
night
and
you
had
complete
and
utter
faith.

Eight
hours,
16
ounces
of
chocolate
and
they
still
don't
taste
right.
No,
these
are
good.
Martha
Stewart
would
be
proud.
Yeah,
look
where
it
got
her.

Santa
Claus,
they
were
so
close,
you
taste
them.
There's
something
missing,
Why
can't
I
remember?
But
eventually,
you
grow
up.
One
day
you
open
your
eyes,
Look,
just
call
her.
Most
people
turn
to
the
things
I
don't
want
to
call
my
mother.
So
let's
go
sleep
at
your
house
tonight.
What?
Why
are
we
always
sleeping
at
my
house?
-
Do
you
even
have
one?
A
house.
With
a
closet.
With
your
stuff
in
it.
Do
you
even
have
one
of
those?
Mmm.
Good
morning.
-

Hey.
You
guys
want
a
cupcake?
Izzie
made
them.
I
like
it
here.
You
said
yourself,
sleeping
in
your
own
bed.
You're
like
a
health
nut.
You
eat
muesli
every
morning.
No,
I
don't.
OK,
the
muesli
thing,
you
do.
The
last
seven
days,
at
least.
Oh,
come
on.
I
haven't
been
here
for
a
whole
week.
-
Have
I?
Even
they
think
it's
weird.

But
the
thing
is,
it's
hard
to
let
go
Almost
everyone
still
of
faith,
that
one
day
and
it
will
all
come
true.

So
I've
checked
the
schedule.
I
start
ENT
On
the
9th.
Can
you
get
me
in
then?
Oh,
I'm
afraid
not.
We
have
openings
on
the
16th.
There
are
other
options
Adoption,

the
baby.
You
think
it
over.

me
back.

I'm

I'll

I

is

We

what
we're
doing,
Mr.
Duff.
You
saw
the
angio
results.
You
don't
need
to
be
nervous.
I'm
not
talking
about
dying.
My
whole
life
has
been
about
what
I
see
and
about
believing
in
myself,
You're
telling
me
there's

Shepherd
What
is
wrong
with
me?
-
Basically,
you

to

the

You

My
psychic
had
his
surgery.
Yeah?
I
wonder
what
happened
with
his...
gift.
Come
on.
We
all
know
he's
crazy.
You
said
you
didn't
believe
in
that.
I
grew
up
in
a
trailer
park.
I
waited

my
mother
was

Bladder
and
bowels?
The
pressure
stockings

They
do.
I
wanted
to
thank
you
for
everything.
Believing
in
me,
Well,
I'll
come
back
tomorrow,
then.

I
wanted
I
wasn't
sure
it
would
last,
I
know
it's
hardly
anything,
but...
No,
it's
something.
It's
something
really
big.


At
the
end
It
turns
up
when
Mr.
Duff,
you're
still
with
us.
For
your
recipe...
...one
tablespoon
coconut
extract.

It's
like
one
day
may
be
slightly
different

Where
are
we
going?
Trust
me.

The
castle,
well...
...it
may
not
be
a
castle.
Does
it
beat
or
moo?
And
it's
not
so
important
Just
that
it's
happy
right
now.

Mom.
It's

See,
once
in
a
while,
once
in
a
blue
moon,
I've
been
thinking
about
you
a
lot
too.
Where
are
we?
Shh,
shh.
I'm
gonna
tell
you.
All
right.
My
mother's

Five

I

Favorite

The
Clash.
My
favorite
color
is
blue.
The
scar
right
here
on
my
forehead,
that's
why
I
don't
ride
And
I
live
in
that
trailer.
All
this
land
is
mine.
I
have
no
idea
So
that's
it.
That's
all
you've
earned
for
now.
The
rest
you're
just...
...just
gonna
have
to
take
on
faith.

And
once
in
a
while...
