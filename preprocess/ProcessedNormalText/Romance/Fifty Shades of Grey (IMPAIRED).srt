longer,
Actually,
you
know
what?
Which
one's
yours?
All
of
them.

Let's
go
for
a
walk.
How
did
you
start
One
of
my
mother's
friends.
I
was
15.
She
seduced
you?
I
was
her
submissive
Seriously?
Does
your
mother
know
that?
Of
course
not.
No
one
in
my
family
knows
So,
she
introduced
you
Mrs.
Robinson?
CHRISTIAN:
"Mrs.
Robinson."
I'll
tell
her
ANASTASIA:
CHRISTIAN:
On
occasion.
We're
friends.
Ana.
I
know
how
intimidating
I
felt
the
same
at
first.
Well,
what
changed
By
giving
up
control,
From
responsibility,
I
felt
safe.
You
will,
too,
you'll
see.
I've
never
taken
anyone
I've
never
had
sex
I've
never
slept
Ever.
Only
you.
CHRISTIAN:
This
is
Read
it
carefully.
E-mail
me
if
you
I
told
you,
Just
consider
it,
okay?

I
really
hope
you
say
yes.
Thanks
for
the
ride.
Laters,
baby.
Um...
Okay,
you're
all
set.
Your
roommate
let
me
in.
I
just
figured
that
you
ANASTASIA:
ANASTASIA:
Hold
on.
Anastasia
Steele?
Enjoy.
KATE:
Another
gift,
huh?
Whatever
happened
I'm
dying
to
hear
everything.
But
I
have
to
run
right
now,
and
then
we're
going
to
José
called
for
you.
Did
the
mail
already
come?
Oh.
Um,
no,
this
is...
These
are
my
thesis
notes.
Oh.
All
right.
Well,

What?
I
don't
know.
You
look
different.
I
feel
different.
Of
course
you
do.

Okay.
Okay.
Bye!






CHRISTIAN:
The
fundamental
is
to
allow
her
sensuality
and
The
Dominant
and
Submissive
that
all
that
occurs
will
be
consensual,
and
subject
to
and
safety
procedures
The
Submissive

agree
to
any
sexual
activity
excepting
those
activities

Christian.
It's
been
"nice"

Let
me
remind
you

Is
this
what
you
want?


Don't
make
a
sound.




Was
this
"nice"?





What
are
you
doing
to
me?
ANASTASIA:
What
about
here?
Why
not?
Is
it
breaking
the
rules?
Speaking
of
which...
I
haven't
made
up
You're
not
staying?
I
told
you,
Well,
can
we
negotiate?








Now,
that's
a
hell
of
a
sack,
ANASTASIA:
Business
meeting.

And
the
change
And
in

My

You're
flushed.
That
could
just
be
the
wine.
It's
the
adrenaline.
Say
I
did
stay.
What
would
happen?
First,
I
would
help
you
Yes.
And
I'd
be
pleased
Really?
Then
I
would
bend
you
over.
Right
here?
Yes.
On
this
table?
Yes.
Thank
you
for

car.
You
don't
miss

Of

I
