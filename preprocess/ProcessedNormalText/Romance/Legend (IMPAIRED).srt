You
disgust
me.
You're

We
are
all
animals,
Most
are
too
afraid


-
Lily!
There's
nothing
Be
thankful

still
lives.

The
last
Unicorn

a
way.
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on.
Listen.
We're
not
going
down
I

we
should
go
that
way.
No,
not
me.
Let's
go
down
there.


You
know
what?
I
vote
we
run
like
hell.

Let
me
try.
All
right,
all
right.
Oh,

Just
the
two
of

Some...
simple
conversation.
I
have
nothing
You've
stolen
my
dreams
away.
All
things
change,
Lady.
The
dreams
of
youth...
are
the
regrets
of
maturity.
Dreams

my
specialty.
Through
dreams
My
dream...

I
value
your
thoughts.
Share
them
with

Nothing
more
than
that?
I
think
I'll
stand,

No!
Never!
Never!

a
throat
-

Are
you
so...
anxious...
to
see
blood
flow?
As
you
are
to
drink
it.
You
have
but
to
ask.
I
will
stay
here
with
you
-
But
on
one
condition.
l
want
to
kill
the
Unicorn.


I
can't
let
that
happen.
In
the
beginning...
there
was
nothing--
a
void
of
darkness,
a
cold
eternity
Jack,
your
greatest
challenge
And
we
have
not
much
time.

When
the
perfect
void
by
light,
a
great
wailing
was
heard,
and
all
the
brethren
fled

Oona,
fly
up
like
the
wind.
It's
time.
Jack!



Lily.
Judge
her
with
your
heart,
not
your
eyes.
Hear
me,
ye
powers
of
the
night!
We
offer
this
sacrifice,
in
honor
of
you,
sanctified
with
blood...

and
with
fire!
l
pray
you,
Father,

my
