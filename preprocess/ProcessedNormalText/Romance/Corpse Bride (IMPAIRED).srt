WILLIAM:
Assuming

unexpected
And

-It's

terrible
day
It's
a
terrible
day
for
a
wedding
It's
a
sad,
sad
state
of
affairs
we're
in
That
has
led
to
this
ominous
wedding
How
could
our
family
To
marry
off
our
daughter
-They're
so
common
-Oh,
it
couldn
't
be
worse
They
could
be
land-rich,
Without
a
penny
to
their
name
Just
like
you
and
me
Oh,
dear.
And
that's
why
everything
Every
single,
tiny,
microscopic
-According
to
plan
-According
to
plan
From
the
depths
of
deepest
poverty
-To
the
noble
realm
And
who
would
have
guessed
-That
our
daughter
with
a
face
Would
provide
our
ticket

Oh,
HiIdegarde.
What
if
Victor
and
I

As
if
that

Do

SureIy

gasping.


You've
certainIy
hooked
a

ShouIdn't
Victoria

Oh,

We're
every
bit
I
aIways
knew
I
deserved

But
I've
never
even
spoken
to
her.
WeII,
at
Ieast

have
that

Mayhew!
SiIence
that

Marriage
is
a
partnership,
You'd
think
a
Iifetime
watching
us.
.
.

Might
have
taught
her
that
-Might
have
taught
her
that
-Everything
must
be
perfect
Perfect
Every
last
little
thing
Every

According

-Do

I--
I--
I
do
apoIogize,
Miss
EvergIot.
Excuse
me.
Mother
won't
Iet
me
near
the

Music

improper
for
a
young
Iady.
Too
passionate,
she
says.
If
I
may
ask,
Miss
EvergIot.

No.
No,

no.
Oh!
Oh,

I'm
sorry.
What

is
this?
You

Hit

Hey,
give
me
a
listen
At
least
those
of
you
I'll
tell
you
a
story
Of
our
own
jubiliciously
SKELETONS:
But
don
't
wear
a
frown
You
might
try
and
hide
But
we
all
end
up
BONEJANGLES:
Well,
our
girl
was
a
beauty
When
a
mysterious
stranger
He
was
plenty
good-looking
And
our
poor
little
baby
When
her
daddy
said
no
So
our
lovers
came
up
Die,
die,
we
all
pass
away
But
don
't
wear
a
frown
You
might
try
and
hide
But
we
all
end
up
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

BONEJANGLES:
That's
right.
Ah,
okay.
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Like
it.
Okay,
Chancy,
take
it.
Yeah.
Whoo!
Yeah!

Yeah!
Yeah!
That's
nice.
So
they
conjured
up
a
plan
They
told
not
a
soul
Now,
her
mother's
wedding
dress
You
don
't
need
much
Except
for
a
few
things
Like
the
family
jewels
Then
next
to
the
graveyard
On
a
dark,
foggy
night
She
was
ready
to
go
And
then?
-She
waited
-There
in
the
shadows,
was
it
her
man?
-Her
little
heart
beat
so
loud
And
then,
baby,
everything
went
black
Now,
when
she
opened
her
eyes
Her
jewels
were
missing
So
she
made
a
vow
That
she'd
wait
for
her
true
love
Always
waiting
for
someone
Then
out
of
the
blue
Who
vows
forever
And
that's
the
story
Die,
die,
we
all
pass
away
But
don
't
wear
a
frown,
You
might
try
and
hide
But
we
all
end
up
Yeah.

Come
by

Where
have
I--
I--
Oh,

You're
as
coId
as
death.
Your
coat.
Victoria,
I
confess.
This
morning
But
then,
on
meeting
you,
.
.
.and
that
our
wedding
Oh!
Victor,
I
feeI
the
same.

Victoria,
I
se--
I
se--
I
seem
to
find
myseIf
married.
And
you
shouId
know
it's
unexpected.

My
darIing,

DarIing?
Who's
this?
-Who
is
she?
-Victor?
She's
dead.
Look.
Hopscotch.
No!
No!
Victoria!
You
Iied
to
me!
Just
to
get
back
to
that
other
woman.
Don't
you
understand?
No!
You're
married
to
me.


She's
got
a
point.
And
I
thought.
.
.
.
I
thought
Look,
I'm
sorry,
but.
.
.
.
.
.this
just
can't
work.
Why
not?
It's
my
eye,
isn't
it?
No.
Your
eye
is.
.
.
.
.
.IoveIy.
Listen,
under
different
circumstances,
But
we're
just
too
different.
You
shouId've
thought
about
that
Why
can't
you
understand?
It
was


Roses
for
eternaI
Iove.
LiIies
for
sweetness.

Baby's
breath.

Why
so
bIue?
Maybe
he's
right.
MAGGOT:
Maybe
he
should
I
couId
do
it.
Or
perhaps
he
does
beIong
with
her.
With
her
rosy
cheeks
Oh,
those
girIs
are
1
0
a
penny.
You've
got--
You've
got--
You've
got
a
wonderfuI
personaIity.
What
does
that
wispy
little
brat
have
She
can
't
hold
a
candle
How
about
a
puIse?
Overrated
by
a
mile
-Overvalued
If
he
only
knew
And
that
silly
little
creature
And
she
doesn
't
play
piano
No,
she
doesn
't
compare
-But
she
still
breathes
air
-Unimportant
-Overblown
How
special
you
can
be
If
he
only
knew
If
I
touch
a
burning
candle
If
you
cut
me
with
a
knife
And
I
know
her
heart
is
beating
And
I
know
that
I
am
dead
Yet
the
pain
here
that
I
feel
Try
and
tell
me
it's
not
real
And
it
seems
that
I
still
have
The
sole
redeeming
feature
Is
that
she's
alive
-Overrated
Everybody
knows
Which
is
cured
very
quickly
-Who
cares?
-Overrated
If
only
he
could
see
If
he
only
knew
If
I
touch
a
burning
candle
In
the
ice
or
in
the
sun
Yet
I
feel
my
heart
is
aching
Though
it
doesn
't
beat,
it's
breaking
And
the
pain
here
that
I
feel
Try
and
tell
me
it's

Victoria?
Where

Her

Let

For

need
to
repeat
his
vows

drink
from
the
wine
of

Poison!
This
wouId
stop

forever.
OnIy
