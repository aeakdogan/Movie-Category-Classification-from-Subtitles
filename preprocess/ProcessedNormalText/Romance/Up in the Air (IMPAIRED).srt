This
is
what
I
get
in
return
And
they
send
some
yo-yo
like
you
to
try
to
tell
me
that
I'm
out
of
a
job?
They
should
be
telling
you
You
have
a
lot
of
gall
coming
in
here
And
then
you're
going
and
make
more
money
and
I'm
going
to
go
home
I
just...
I
don't
know
where
this
is
coming
from.
How
am
I
supposed
to
go
back
as
a
man
and
explain
this
to
my
wife
On
a
stress
level,
I've
heard
that
losing
your
job
But
personally,
I
feel
more
like
the
people
I
worked
with
were
my
family
I
can't
afford
to
be
unemployed.
I
don't
know
how
you
can
live
but
I'm
sure
that
you'll
find
a
way
Who
the
fuck
are
you,
man?
Excellent
question.
Who
the
fuck
am
I?
Poor
Steve
has
worked
here
He's
never
had
a
meeting
with
me
or
told
me
a
story
in
the
break
room.
And
that's
because
I
don't
work
here.
I
work
for
another
company
that
lends
who
don't
have
the
balls
and
in
some
cases,
for
good
reason.
Because
people
do
crazy
shit
Did
I
do
something
wrong?
I
mean,
is
there
something
This
is
not
an
assessment
You
got
to
try
not
to
take
this
personally.
''Don't
take
it
personally.''
Steven,
I
want
you
to
review
this
packet.
Take
it
seriously.
I
think
you're
going
to
I'm
sure
this
is
going
to
be
very
helpful,
Thank
you.
A
packet.
Well,
anybody
who
ever
built
an
empire
sat
where
you
are
right
now.
And
it's
because
they
sat
there
That's
the
truth.
I'm
going
to
need
your
key
card.
Great.
Okay.
Now,
I
want
you
to
take
the
day,
and
then
tomorrow,
You
go
out
for
a
jog,
you
give
yourself
some
routines,
How
do
I
get
in
touch
with
you?
Don't
worry,
This
is
just
the
beginning.
I'll
never
see
Steve
again.
Thank
you.
To
know
me
is
to
fly
with
me.
This
is
where
I
live.
When
I
run
my
card,
the
system
to
greet
me
with
this
exact
statement.
Pleasure
to
see
you
again,
Mr.
Bingham.
It's
these
kinds
of
systemized,
friendly
touches
All
the
things
you
probably
the
recycled
air,
the
artificial
lighting,
the
cheap
sushi,
Do
you
want
the
cancer?
-The
what?
The
cancer?
The
can,
sir?
No.
I'm
fine,
thank
you.
How
much
does
your
life
weigh?
Imagine
for
a
second
I
want
you
to
feel
the
straps
Feel
them?
Now
I
want
you
to
pack
it
with
You
start
with
the
little
things,
the
knickknacks,
the
collectibles.
Feel
the
weight
as
that
adds
up.
Then
you
start
adding
larger
stuff,
clothes,
tabletop
appliances,
your
TV.
The
backpack
should
be
And
you
go
bigger.
Your
couch,
bed,
your
kitchen
table.
Your
car,
get
it
in
there.
Your
home,
whether
it's
a
studio
I
want
you
to
stuff
it
all
Now
try
to
walk.
It's
kind
of
hard,
isn't
it?
This
is
what
we
do
to
ourselves
We
weigh
ourselves
down
And
make
no
mistake,
moving
is
living.
Now,
I'm
going
to
set
that
backpack
What
do
you
want
to
take
out
of
it?
Photos
are
for
people
Drink
some
ginkgo
In
fact,
let
everything
burn
and
imagine
It's
kind
of
exhilarating,
isn't
it?
Welcome
back,
Mr.
Bingham.
Ryan
Bingham's
office.
You
put
me
in
a
Dodge
Stratus
They
were
completely
out
of
-Did
you
try...
I
reminded
them
of
your
remarkable
No.1
Gold
Club
status
They
are
literally
moving
mountains
Fair
enough.
Any
other
messages?
Your
sister
Kara
called.
Needs
to
speak
urgently
I
told
her
you
were
mid-air
and
-Well
done.
to
speak
at
Goal
quest
in
Vegas.
Goal
quest
20?
Every
once
in
a
while,
I
do
speaking
But
Goal
quest?
It's
got
a
hologram
on
it.
They're
calling
it
Dos
Equips.
All
right,
I'll
check
in.
-Hold
on.
I've
got
Craig
Gregory
for
you.
Fuck.
How
is
my
little
road
warrior?
Hey,
20
minutes
from
boarding
Real
good
numbers
out
of
Phoenix,
Hey,
you
know
that
Big
Auto
another
10K
before
the
end
-No
kidding.
I
wish
I
could
have
you
but
I
do
need
you
back
here
in
Omaha
-All
right?
Well,
you
know,
we
got
something
What
are
we
talking
about
here?
You'll
see.
Today
I
took
my
first
crap
-That's
me
hanging
up
on
you.
Are
you
satisfied
with
Maestro?
Yeah,
I
am.
A
little
stingy
with
their
miles.
No,
Hertz
keeps
its
vehicles
too
long.
If
a
car
has
over
20,000
miles,
Maestro
doesn't
instant
checkout.
Hertz
doesn't
guarantee
navigation.
It's
funny.
You
don't
seem
like
a
girl
I
hate
asking
for
directions.
That
new
outfit,
Colonial,
isn't
bad.
-Is
that
a
joke?
-Because
their
kiosk
placement
blows.
Basically,
it's
a
fleet
of
shit-boxes.
I
don't
know
-I'm
Ryan.
Maplewood
card.
How
dare
you
bring
that
Hilton
offers
equal
value
and
better
food,
but
the
Maplewood
gives
out
They
got
you
with
the
cookies,
did
they?
Yeah.
I'm
a
sucker
for
You
know,
It's
a
mixture
of
''faux''
and
''homey.''
My
God.
I
wasn't
sure
this
actually
existed.
This
is
the
American
Airlines...
It's
a
Concierge
Key,
yeah.
-What
is
that,
carbon
fibber?
God,
I
love
the
weight.
I
was
pretty
excited
the
day
Yeah.
I'll
say.
I
put
up
pretty
pedestrian
numbers.
60
thou
a
year,
domestic.
-That's
not
bad.
-What's
your
total?
-Please.
Come
on.
Show
some
hubris.
-I
bet
it's
huge.
How
big?
What
is
it,
this
big?
-This
big?
Come
on!
Come
on.
Let's
just
say
I
have
a
number
in
mind.
This
is
pretty
fucking
sexy.
Hope
it
doesn't
cheapen
We're
2
people
who
get
turned
on
I
think
cheap
is
our
starting
point.
There's
nothing
cheap
about
loyalty.
So,
we
came
up
with
this
master
plan,
to
put
gauze,
Then
we
got
on
the
plane,
transatlantic,
flying
to
Zurich.
Walked
up...
Waited
till
it
was
dark,
and
walked
up
to
the
bathroom
with
her.
Everybody
was
watching
the
movie,
Opened
up,
went
inside.
She
opened
the
door
for
me,
and
came
in
And
then,
you
know,
we
gave
it
But
it
was
fun.
It
was
tricky.
-Give
me
some
details.
-Have
you
ever
tried
it?
It's
not
so
easy.
-Really?
-You've
done
that?
On
a
transatlantic
flight?
On
a
domestic
flight.
Regional,
actually.
-Like
nighttimes?
-You...
I
mean,
how
do
you
do
that?
I'm
really
flexible.
Look.
I
should
throw
these
out.
We
can
always
use
that
room
Here,
look.
Good
call
on
that
towel
rack.
I
like
how
you
burr
toed
me
I
was
improvising.
Shame
we
didn't
make
it
to
the
closet.
-We
got
to
do
this
again.
All
right,
I'm
in
Newark
on
the
12th,
Oklahoma
City
on
the
15th.
Any
Southwest?
I'll
be
swinging
by
No,
but
I'll
be
in
Florida
on
the
20th.
-Fort
Lauderdale?
-That's
nothing.
I
should
probably
go
back
to
my
room
I
think
that
would
be
Nice
meeting
you.
A
pleasure.
-Hello?
Every
family
has
the
one
person
That's
my
sister
Kara,
the
glue.
Fine.
You
and
the
kids?
Missy's
outstanding,
-Couldn't
be
better.
Yeah?
I
didn't
even
want
to
have
to
ask
you
this
because
I
know
how
you
are
but
we're
coming
up
on
3
weeks
and
there's
something
Yeah?
We've
been
sending
people
these
kits
so
they
can
print
out
photos
and
then
take
photos
of
them
kind
of
like
that
gnome
Why?
Because
it's
Julie's
wedding
-Does
it
matter
why?
Would
you
call
her?
You're
awfully
isolated
the
way
you
live.
Isolated?
I'm
surrounded.
So,
your
assistant
said
Did
he?
Can
you
get
a
photo
of
the
cut
out
The
place
is
a
shithole.
Jesus,
Ryan,
Can
you
just
take
a
stupid
photo?
I'll
try
my
best.
Thank
you
for
trying
your
best.
Last
year,
I
spent
322
days
on
the
road,
which
means
I
had
to
spend
Hey,
neighbour.
Hey.
Hi!
Hi.
Hey,
I
signed
for
this
Thanks.
-I
hope
it
wasn't
too
much
of
a
bother.
Yeah,
it's
my
sister.
I
haven't
met
-Lots
of
luck.
What
are
you
doing
tonight?
I've
started
seeing
somebody.
Okay.
Great.
Hey,
it's
good
to
see
you.
-You,
too.
Okay.
I
am
just...
I'm
thrilled
that
Welcome
home,
boys.
I
know
there's
been
a
lot
of
whispering
so
let
me
jump
right
in.
Auto
industry
is
in
the
dump.
Housing
market
It
is
one
of
the
worst
times
on
record
This
is
our
moment.
Now,
last
summer,
we
received
from
Cornell,
and
she
had
some
pretty
big
ideas
And
my
first
reaction
was,
But
after
I
gave
it
a
listen,
So,
with
a
peek
into
our
future,
If
there's
one
word
I
want
to
''Glacial''?
Glacial.
Our
global
must
become
local.
This
company
keeps
23
people
It's
expensive,
and
it's
inefficient.
When
I
came
to
Craig
he
told
me,
and
quite
astutely,
Well,
today
I
stand
before
you
You
all
know
Ned
in
reception.
Sorry,
Ned.
I'm
sure
HR
We'll
see
about
that.
Now
Ned
could
be
any
employee
in
any
Strategy
packets
Ned
would
be
given
a
seat
and
find
one
of
our
transition
specialists
Mr.
Laski,
the
reason
is
your
position
is
no
longer
available.
I
don't
understand.
I'm
fired?
Hearing
the
words
''you've
been
let
go''
Change
is
always
scary,
Anybody
who
ever
built
an
empire
sat
where
you
are
now.
And
it's
because
they
sat
there
That's
my
fucking
line.
But
what
happens
now?
This
is
the
first
step
of
a
process
that
will
end
with
you
in
a
new
job
Yeah.
But
how
does
it
work?
I
want
you
to
take
the
packet
Review
it.
All
the
answers
Start
filling
out
and
before
you
know
it,
you'll
be
Now,
Ned,
and
start
putting
together
your
things.
As
a
favour
to
me,
I'd
appreciate
it
Panic
doesn't
help
anyone.
I
understand.
Give
it
up
for
Ned.
You
can
start
the
morning
in
Boston,
and
finish
the
day
in
San
Francisco,
all
for
the
price
of
a
T1
line.
Our
inflated
travel
budget
And
more
importantly
no
more
Christmases
no
more
hours
lost
to
weather
delays.
You
get
to
come
home.
Tell
me
you're
not
taking
this
seriously.
That's
why
I
brought
because
we're
not
taking
it
seriously.
There
is
a
methodology
to
what
I
do.
Coke
and
IBM
have
been
doing
this
Are
you
familiar
with
them?
Now
just
like
anything
else,
you
know,
it's
going
to
take
a
few
months
and
then
everybody
is
going
to
settle
in.
Who
are
you
taking
off
the
road?
How
are
you
not
getting
this?
Everybody's
grounded.
It's
done.
What
we
do
here
is
brutal,
But
there
is
a
dignity
to
the
way
I
do
it.
By
stabbing
them
in
the
chest
-You
wanted
to
see
me?
Yeah.
You
know
what?
-Come
on
in
here.
-Thank
you.
How's
everyone
taking
it?
Listen,
I
admire
your...
Your
zeal.
And
I
think
But
you
know
nothing
You
can
set
up
an
chat,
-Actually,
I
minored
in
psychology.
-Okay,
kiddo,
fire
me.
Well,
since
she's
going
to
be
doing
this
don't
you
want
to
know
if
-She's
fired
Ned.
-You
don't
need
to
do
this.
Mr.
Bingham,
I
regret
to
inform
you
that
your
position
at
this
company
-Who
the
hell
are
you?
-I'm
here
today
to
discuss
your
future.
The
only
one
who
can
fire
me
Mr.
Gregory
hired
me
Handle
what?
Handle
me?
Mr.
Gregory
hired
me,
You
know
what?
-Mr.
Bingham.
You're
on
a
computer
screen,
-Ryan.
-Fire
me
again.
Actually,
you
didn't.
Fire
me.
That's
enough.
I
think
we
get
it.
Mr.
Bingham,
that
your
position
is
no
longer
available.
-I'm
fired?
-Never
say
fired.
-Why?
How
could
I
possibly
know
why?
Why
doesn't
matter.
It's
important
not
to
focus
on
the
why
and
rather
to
spend
your
energy
Well,
I'm
going
to
spend
my
energy
-a
good
reason
why
you're
firing
me.
the
reason's
not
important.
So,
you're
firing
me
without
grounds?
I
get
what
you're
trying
to
say,
Ryan.
-Don't
take
this
personally,
Mr.
Bingham.
This
is
the
most
personal
situation
so
before
you
try
to
revolutionize
I'd
like
to
know
That's
a
hell
of
a
way
Am
I
the
only
one
that
sees
we're
making
ourselves
irrelevant?
No,
frankly,
we're
making
you
irrelevant.
-Nice.
Blame
the
high
fuel
costs.
Blame
You
know,
you
better
watch
yourself.
You're
a
little
too
young
I'm
not
a
dinosaur.
I
want
you
to
show
her
the
ropes.
What
do
I
know
what
goes
on
here?
I'm
not
talking
about
here.
-No.
Come
on.
-doesn't
know
what
she's
doing,
so...
I
don't
think
a
MySpace
page
qualifies
Well,
then
great.
Here's
your
chance.
Go
out
there,
show
her
the
magic,
I'm
not
a
fucking
tour
guide.
Now
here
we
go.
Bingham,
here's
the
boat.
And
here's
you.
Yeah,
alone.
We're
ringing
the
bell.
You
want
to
stay
out
there
you're
welcome
to
do
it,
You
let
me
know.
Christ.
-What?
I
really
like
my
luggage.
That's
exactly
what
it
is,
it's
luggage.
You
know
how
much
time
you
lose
-I
don't
know.
5,
10
minutes?
I
travel
270
days
a
year.
That's
157
hours.
You're
willing
to
throw
away
You
don't
need
this.
You're
not
going
to
need
that.
This,
they
have
better
ones
there.
I'll
get
rid
of
this.
I
can
just
meet
you
at
security.
Thank
you.
Bingo,
Asians.
You
can't
be
serious.
Never
get
behind
people
I've
never
seen
a
stroller
collapse
Old
people
are
worse.
Their
bodies
are
littered
and
they
never
seem
to
appreciate
Here
you
go.
5
words.
Randomly
selected
Asians.
They
pack
light,
travel
efficiently,
-You've
got
to
love
them.
I'm
like
my
mother.
I
stereotype.
Are
you
mad
at
your
computer?
I
type
with
purpose.
What
is
it
that
you're
working
on
I'm
building
a
workflow
It's
questions
and
responses,
It's
a
script
taking
you
through
Who's
it
for?
Well,
theoretically,
and
they'd
be
downsizing
immediately.
All
you
have
to
do
is
follow
the
steps.
Natalie,
what
is
it
you
think
we
do
here?
We
prepare
the
newly
unemployed
for
the
emotional
and
physical
hurdles
while
minimizing
legal
blowback.
That's
what
we're
selling.
Okay.
What
are
we
doing?
We
are
here
to
make
limbo
tolerable,
to
ferry
wounded
souls
until
the
point
where
hope
And
then
stop
the
boat,
shove
them
That
was
really
impressive.
I
got
to
grab
this.
Okay.
Hey,
I
was
hoping
I'd
hear
from
you.
I'm
in
Hotlanta,
Fat
Matt's.
Bring
a
bib.
You
never
called.
Well,
I
wasn't
sure
Appropriate?
Ryan,
I'm
not
some
waitress
That
word
has
no
place
I
am
the
woman
that
you
don't
have
Sounds
like
a
trap.
Listen,
the
next
time
that
you're
worried
If
you
want
to
call,
call.
Just
think
of
me
as
yourself,
When
am
I
going
to
see
you?
Well,
I'm
out
of
Hartsfield
into
IAD,
with
a
connection
at
ORD
into
SDF.
-Sorry.
How
long's
your
layover?
Think
you
could
push?
Yeah,
I
can
push.
All
you
have
to
do
today
And
when
I
talk
about
a
strategy
packet,
Sounds
great.
So,
although
I
wish
I
were
here
the
fact
is
that
because
this
will
be
your
last
week
-Why
me?
Am
I
supposed
to
feel
better
This
is
ridiculous!
I
have
been
a
fine
employee
and
this
is
the
way
you
treat
me.
How
do
you
sleep
at
night,
man?
How?
How's
your
family?
Electricity
still
on?
Heat
still
on?
Refrigerator
full
of
food?
Gas
tank
full
of
gas?
Going
to
Chuck
E.
Cheese
Not
me.
No,
my
kids,
What
do
you
suggest
I
tell
them?
Perhaps
you're
underestimating
that
your
career
transition
The
positive
effect?
I
make
about
90
grand
a
year
now.
Unemployment
is
what,
Is
that
one
of
your
positive
effects?
Well,
we'll
get
to
be
cosier,
because
I'm
not
going
to
be
able
So,
maybe
we
can
move
one-bedroom
apartment
somewhere.
And
I
guess
without
benefits,
I'll
be
able
to
hold
my
daughter
as
she,
that
I
won't
be
able
to
afford
Well,
tests
have
shown
that
children
have
a
tendency
as
a
method
of
coping.
Go
fuck
yourself.
That's
what
my
kids
think.
Your
children's
admiration
Yeah.
Yeah,
it
was.
Well,
I
doubt
they
ever
Hey,
asshole,
aren't
you
supposed
I'm
not
a
shrink,
Bob.
I'm
a
wake-up
call.
You
know
why
kids
love
athletes?
I
don't
know.
No,
that's
why
we
love
athletes.
Kids
love
athletes
-Well,
I
can't
dunk.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Your
resume
says
that
you
minored
Most
students,
but
you
bussed
tables
at
El
Picador
And
then
you
get
out
of
college
How
much
did
they
first
pay
you
27
grand
a
year.
And
when
were
you
going
to
stop
and
come
back
Good
question.
I
see
guys
who
work
at
guys
exactly
like
you.
They
clock
in,
they
clock
out,
and
they
never
have
You
have
an
opportunity
here,
Bob.
This
is
a
rebirth.
Now,
if
not
for
you,
He
just
waltzes
in
and
cuts
in
line?
We
reserve
priority
assistance
The
promotions
are
great.
Hungry
much?
Our
business
expense
I
plan
on
grabbing
Okay,
you
got
to
fill
me
in
What
is
that
about?
Are
you
talking
about,
like,
-You
really
want
to
know?
I
don't
spend
a
nickel
if
I
can
help
it
unless
it
somehow
profits
So,
what
are
you
saving
up
for,
It's
not
like
that.
The
miles
are
the
goal.
That's
it?
You're
saving
just
to
save?
Let's
just
say
that
I
have
a
number
That's
a
little
abstract.
I'd
rather
not.
Is
it
a
secret
target?
It's
10
million
miles.
Okay.
Isn't
10
million
just
a
number?
-Pi's
just
a
number.
No,
I...
I
get
it.
It
sounds
cool.
I'd
be
the
7th
person
to
do
it.
-Do
they
throw
you
a
parade?
You
get
to
meet
the
chief
pilot,
Maynard
Finch.
And
they
put
your
name
Men
get
such
hard-ones
You
guys
don't
grow
up.
Now
who's
stereotyping?
Fear
of
mortality.
It's
like,
And
why
do
you
suppose
Probably
because
you
can't
have
babies.
The
baby
argument.
If
I
had
that
many
miles,
I
would
show
up
at
an
airport,
look
at
the
destination
board,
Thanks
for
the
advice.
Jesus.
Okay.
Closer.
Way
closer.
Still
closer.
Closer.
Okay.
A
little
left.
Okay,
down
a
little.
Too
far.
Up.
Up
one
more
inch.
I
don't
get
it.
Why
does
your
sister
My
sister
is
kooky.
It's
like
the
gnome
thing.
No,
I
mean,
in
front
of
the
St.
Louis
airport?
Are
you
kidding,
Lambert
Field?
The
Wright
brothers
flew
through
there.
That
domed
main
terminal,
It's
a
precursor
from
everything,
-Pretty
sweet.
Well,
that's
a
keeper.
Let
me
see
it.
Why
she
wants
dozens
of
reminders
of
all
the
places
she
hasn't
been
Well,
I'm
sure
she'll
be
crushed
Look,
before
Lindbergh
could
cross
he
took
off
from
one
of
those
runways.
Do
you
ever
wonder
why
they
called
it
-No.
Do
you
know
how
fucked
I
am
the
one
thing,
the
one
thing,
preventing
this
place
Sometimes
they
just
need
to
vent.
Please,
for
the
love
of
God,
-Miss
Barnes,
thank
you
for
joining
us.
Well,
we're
here
to
talk
about
You
don't
have
to
sugar
coat
it.
What
are
they
offering?
Inside
the
packet,
you'll
find
a
clearly
Give
me
the
bullet
points.
It's
actually
pretty
good.
3
months'
pay,
6
months'
medical
and
a
full
year
of
placement
services
Placement
services.
That's
generous.
Commonly,
it
takes
one
month
of
you
expect
to
earn
in
salary.
So,
I
could
be
looking
for
a
while.
-Not
necessarily.
I'm
pretty
confident
about
my
plans.
-Really?
There's
this
beautiful
bridge
I'm
going
to
go
jump
off
it.
Natalie.
Hey!
Natalie!
People
say
these
things
all
the
time.
It's
part
of
the
trade.
-They
do?
I
mean,
they
say
crazy
things.
They
get
worked
up.
She
was
really
calm.
I
think
that's
a
good
sign.
So,
they
don't
ever
actually
do
it?
No.
No,
it's
just
talk.
How
do
you
know?
Do
you
follow
up?
I
mean,
no.
I
wouldn't
worry
about
it.
This
is
what
we
do,
Natalie.
We
take
people
at
their
most
fragile,
You
ready
to
go
back
in?
All
right,
let's
go.
Come
on.
No,
I'm
fine.
Tell
me
something
sweet.
I'll
be
back
soon.
I'm
not
really
sure
how
long
No,
I
don't
even
think
of
him
that
way.
I'm
done?
I
wasn't
expecting
this.
Not
at
all.
Just
like
that?
I'm
disappointed
that
I've
given
This
is
not
fair.
There
are
people
that
are
going
to
be
I
don't
know
what
to
do
when
I
wake
up
Are
you
okay?
-Are
we
going?
This
is
how
I
start
every
day
of
my
life.
Now,
this
is
going
to
be
a
little
difficult,
You
have
a
new
backpack.
Only
this
time,
Start
with
casual
acquaintances,
folks
around
the
office.
And
then
you
move
into
the
people
that
you
trust
with
Your
cousins,
your
aunts,
your
uncles,
your
brothers,
your
sisters,
And
finally
your
husband,
your
wife,
You
get
them
into
that
backpack.
Don't
worry.
I'm
not
going
to
ask
you
Feel
the
weight
of
that
bag.
Make
no
mistake,
components
in
your
life.
Do
you
feel
the
straps
All
those
negotiations
and
arguments
You
don't
need
to
carry
all
that
weight.
Why
don't
you
set
that
bag
down?
Some
animals
were
meant
to
live
symbiotically
for
a
lifetime.
Star-crossed
lovers,
We
are
not
those
animals.
The
slower
we
move,
the
faster
we
die.
We
are
not
swans.
We're
sharks.
-Never?
-Ever?
-You
never
want
to
get
married?
-Never
want
kids?
-Ever?
-Is
that
so
bizarre?
Yes,
it
is.
I
just
don't
see
the
value
in
it.
-All
right,
sell
it
to
me.
Sell
me
marriage.
-Okay,
how
about
love?
Stability,
just
somebody
How
many
stable
marriages
Somebody
to
talk
to,
I'm
surrounded
by
people
to
talk
to.
How
about
just
not
dying
alone?
Starting
when
I
was
12,
we
moved
each
one
of
My
parents
went
the
same
way.
Make
no
mistake,
we
all
die
alone.
Now,
those
cult
members
in
San
Diego
they
didn't
die
alone.
I'm
just
saying
there
are
options.
Fuck.
Brian
left
me.
All
right.
Okay,
okay.
All
right.
All
right.
Yeah.
Hey.
Natalie,
this
is
Alex,
my
friend.
I
should
give
you
both
a
moment.
No.
No,
that's
fine.
I'm
fine.
It's
a
pleasure
to
meet
you.
Maybe
we
should
just
all
go
up
Or
maybe
a
drink?
Now
you're
talking.
He
broke
up
with
you
It's
kind
of
like
firing
someone
What
a
weasels
prick.
Yeah.
But
what
does
that
make
me?
-Someone
who
falls
for
a
prick.
Pricks
are
spontaneous,
And
then
we're
surprised
I
followed
him
to
Omaha.
You
did?
I
had
a
job
waiting
for
me
when
he
got
an
offer
from
ConAgra.
He
said
we
could
start
a
life
together.
So,
I
followed
him.
To
Nebraska?
I
thought
I'd
be
engaged
by
now.
No
offense.
-None
taken.
When
I
was
16,
maybe
have
a
kid,
corner
office
by
day,
I
was
supposed
to
be
driving
Yeah,
life
can
underwhelm
you
that
way.
I
mean,
where
did
you
think
It
doesn't
work
that
way.
At
a
certain
point,
It
can
be
a
little
counterproductive.
I
don't
want
to
say
anything
I
really
appreciate
everything
-It
was
our
pleasure.
But
sometimes
it
feels
like
it's
not
going
to
matter
You
really
thought
this
guy
I
could
have
made
it
work.
He...
He
really
fit
the
bill.
-You
know?
White-collar,
college
grad,
loves
dogs,
likes
funny
movies,
works
in
finance
but
is
outdoorsy,
I
always
imagined
he'd
have
a
single
In
a
perfect
world,
he
drives
a
4Runner.
And
the
only
thing
he
loves
And
a
nice
smile.
-What
about
you?
You
know,
honestly,
all
the
physical
requirements
I
mean,
like,
you
secretly
pray
and
not
an
asshole
would
be
nice.
Just
someone
who
enjoys
my
company,
Because
you
don't
think
about
that
I
don't
know.
Someone
who
wants
kids.
Likes
kids.
Wants
kids.
Healthy
enough
to
play
with
his
kids.
Please
let
him
earn
more
money
You
might
not
understand
that
now,
Otherwise,
that's
a
recipe
for
disaster.
And
hopefully
some
hair
on
his
head,
but,
I
mean,
even
that's
not
A
nice
smile.
Yeah,
a
nice
smile.
That
was
depressing.
-I
should
just
date
women.
We're
no
picnic
ourselves.
I
don't
mind
being
married
to
my
career,
and
I
don't
expect
it
to
hold
me
in
bed
I
just
don't
want
to
settle.
You're
young.
Right
now
you
see
It
is,
by
definition.
Yeah.
But
by
the
time
someone
is
right
And
the
only
person
left
to
judge
you
will
be
the
23-year-old
girl
So,
what's
the
plan
for
the
evening?
Well,
we
were
going
to
hit
that
party
I
didn't
know
you
could
just
attend
those.
I
thought
you
had
to
be
registered.
Well,
technically,
I
don't
think
-it's
open
to
the
public.
You're
going
to
crash
it?
-They
throw
a
really
nice
party.
-than
they
know
what
to
do
with.
No,
no,
I
get
it.
I'm
in.
Jennifer
Chu?
-Shit!
Doing
all
right?
Yeah.
This
was
a
great
idea.
You're
so
pretty.
You're
exactly
Thank
you,
Natalie.
You
should
dance.
-Come
on.
Come
on.
-Hi.
I'm
Dave.
Who's
Jennifer?
I
don't
know.
All
right.
All
right.
Right
about
now,
give
it
up
Young
MC!
What's
up,
alpha
TECH?
I
got
a
busted
computer
at
home.
Bust
a
move!
-Say,
"Yeah!"
-Say,
"Oh,
yeah!"
-Say,
"Bust
a
move!"
-Say,
"Bust
a
move!"
-Let
me
hear
you
say,
"Yeah!"
I
want
you
to
have
a
key
to
my
place.
I
had
no
idea
we
were
Yes.
Where
is
she?
Lying
in
my
bed
I
hear
the
Clock
tick
and
think
of
you
Caught
up
in
circles
Confusion
is
nothing
new
Flash
back
To
warm
nights
Almost
left
behind
Suitcase
of
memories
Time
after
Sometimes
you
picture
me...
Back
home
I
don't
get
to
act
the
way
-That's
why
I
don't
have
a
back
home.
You're
so
cool.
Mr.
Empty
Backpack.
-You
know
about
my
backpack?
You
did?
It's
what
us
modern
girls
do
Did
it
bother
you?
It
depends.
Is
the
bag
empty
or
because
you
hate
the
baggage
I
don't
hate
people.
You
just
don't
want
to
be
tied
down
I
don't
know
what
originally
sparked
Probably
needed
to
be
alone.
Recently,
I've
been
thinking
before
I
knew
what
to
put
back
in
it.
-No!
Hey.
You're
up?
Yeah,
I
have
to
fly
standby
Okay.
I
made
you
feel
cheap.
It's
all
right.
I'll
text
you
later
Hey.
I
really
like
you.
-I
like
you,
too.
Go
catch
your
plane.
Last
night...
It
was
kind
of
out
of
hand,
I'm
not
actually
sure
of
everything
-but
I
didn't
want
you
to
think...
It
was
nice
to
see
you
cut
loose.
So,
did
you
wake
him
up
or
slip
out?
-What?
Did
you
wake
him
up
or
did
you
just
slip
out
-I
just
left.
What
happened
to
Alex?
She
had
to
leave
town
early
-That's
too
bad.
Where
does
she
live?
Thinking
of
going
to
see
her?
We
don't
really
have
that
That
direction.
What
kind
of
relationship
do
you
have?
Well,
you
know,
casual.
-Sounds
pretty
special.
Don't
you
think
there's
a
future
there?
I
never
really
thought
about
it.
-Really
never
thought
about
it?
How
can
you
not
think
about
that?
How
does
it
not
even
cross
your
mind
that
you
might
want
It's
simple.
You
know
that
moment
and
you
can
feel
them
and
the
whole
world
goes
quiet
-Yes.
-You're
an
asshole.
Look,
I'm
just
decking
around.
Come
on.
Don't
you
think
it's
worth
-A
chance
to
what?
Natalie,
your
definition
of
real
Can
you
stop
condescending
or
is
that
one
of
the
principles
-Bullshit
philosophy?
-Is
that
supposed
to
be
charming?
-It's
a
cocoon
of
self-banishment.
Screw
you.
Screw
you,
too.
You
have
set
up
a
way
of
life
for
you
to
have
any
kind
of
And
now
this
woman
comes
along
and
somehow
runs
the
gauntlet
and
comes
out
on
the
other
end
smiling
I
need
to
grow
up?
I
don't
have
a
gauntlet...
Fuck.
Now,
listen,
They've
been
getting
hammered.
So,
you
don't
get
distracted.
You
get
these
packets
in
their
hand
Hey,
welcome
to
Detroit.
What's
going
on
here?
I've
been
looking
at
those
I
thought
maybe
we
should
just
nut
up
We
could
use
a
little
more
time.
Well,
you
got
to
leave
the
nest
This
is
a
real
company,
Craig.
I
know.
It's
a
good
thing
Let's
stop
screwing
around.
All
right.
Just
give
me
a
minute
I
was
thinking
that
Natalie
She's
hardly
ready
for
that.
I've
been
watching
her
results
This
is
a
whole
other
animal.
You
know,
she
created
it
Natalie,
are
you
not
up
for
it?
-Yeah,
I'm
game.
Just
remember,
don't
apologize,
Today's
one
of
the
worst
days
How
we
feel
doesn't
even
compare.
-Got
it.
You'll
be
fine.
What's
all
this?
What's
going
on?
Hello,
Mr.
Samuels.
However,
your
position
here
What
are
you
talking
about?
You've
been
let
go.
Just
like
that?
Who
are
you?
My
name
is
Miss
Keener,
and
I'm
here
today
I
worked
for
this
company
for
17
years
and
they
send
a
4th-grader
What
the
fuck
is
this?
It's
perfectly
normal
to
be
upset.
However,
the
sooner
you
can
-opportunities
are
waiting
for
you...
I'm
57
fucking
years
old.
Anybody
who
ever
built
an
empire
sat
where
you
are
now.
And
it's
because
they
sat
there
There's
a
packet
in
front
of
you.
I
want
All
the
answers
you're
looking
for
The
sooner
you
trust
the
process,
the
sooner
the
next
step
of
your
life
I
need
you
to
go
back
to
your
office
now
and
start
putting
together
Mr.
Samuels,
Mr.
Samuels.
Mr.
Samuels.
Mr.
Samuels!
You
did
good.
You
okay?
You
want
me
to
take
over?
No,
I'm
all
right.
No.
Look,
we
just
got
here.
That's
one
place.
Maybe
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
but
it's
comforting
to
know
I
know
you
don't
give
a
shit
I
think
we
could
try
a
few
more,
Fine.
All
right.
Okay.
All
right.
He
thought
you
did
a
great
job.
Thanks.
They're
pulling
us
off
the
road.
We're
going
home.
Really?
For
good?
Yeah.
Good
job.
I'm
sorry
about
what
I
said
about
Alex.
It's
all
right.
I
understand.
I
mean,
who
am
I
to
be
doling
out
No
kidding.
Are
you
going
to
be
okay?
-What
do
you
mean?
I
don't
know.
It's
better
than
you'd
think.
Ryan.
Ryan.
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
grabbing
another
flight.
I'll
see
you
back
at
home.
Okay,
just
walk
it
in
a
little.
A
little
more.
There
you
go.
Yeah.
Got
it.
They're
a
cute
couple.
-You
think
so?
How
do
you
like
Wisconsin
in
February?
I
like
it
if
you're
there.
And
I
know
a
killer
burger
in
Milwaukee.
Northern
Wisconsin.
What
are
you
doing
this
weekend?
-No.
-Well,
you
want
me
to
be
your
date?
-At
your
sister's
wedding?
Look,
I'm
not
the
wedding
type,
right?
But
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
want
a
dance
partner.
And
if
you
can
stomach
it,
Excuse
me.
Are
you
available?
This
line's
for
members
Hey.
Ryan.
-Hey.
-Hi.
Alex,
this
is
my
sister
Kara.
-Hi.
Ryan's
told
me
nothing
about
you.
So,
you
two
are
dating?
-Not
exactly.
We're
all
getting
a
little
old
I
remember
when
Mom
God.
Drove
me
up
the
wall.
So,
what
are
you
doing
at
the
hotel?
Yeah.
Okay,
Frank
and
I
are
trying
out
I'm
sorry.
No,
there
was
a
room
on
hold
here,
so
I
thought
I'd
just
take
it
-So,
the
rehearsal
dinner.
Nice
digs.
There's
a
packet.
Hey,
look
who's
here.
-My
God!
-My
God!
Ryan!
Hi.
-You
must
be
Alex.
-You
are
so
beautiful.
Kara
was
right.
Gosh.
You
look
so
grown-up.
I
do?
I
know,
right?
You
haven't
even
seen
my
ring.
-Look
at
that.
-Jim
designed
it.
Hey,
Jim.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I'm
Ryan.
-Alex.
Pleasure.
Thank
you,
guys,
for
coming.
Brother!
-It's
true,
though.
I
got
the
pictures
you
asked
me
to
get.
You
can
just
put
them
right
there.
Yeah,
okay.
You
got
so
many
of
them
up
there,
I
know.
It's
so
great.
What
gave
you
the
idea
Substantial.
Well,
Jim
has
a
lot
of
our
nest
egg
It's
a
real
estate
investment.
It's
exciting,
A
honeymoon
just
kind
of
at
this
state
just
doesn't
really
seem
affordable.
So,
you
know,
we
just
thought,
''Just
because
we
can't
travel
-No,
I
think
that's
a
fabulous
idea.
I
mean,
Okay?
You
buy
a
maintenance
contract
You
know,
we'll
whack
your
weeds,
Furniture,
you
can
bring
your
own
or
else
you
can
pick
one
Seamless
traditionalism,
Nice.
And
we
all
need
a
place
to
call
our
own.
This
is
America.
-It's
a
nice
touch.
The
bit
at
the
end
about
the
promise.
Thanks.
You...
You
still
renting
-No.
I
gave
it
up.
-No.
No,
not
really.
So,
you're
just
good?
I'm
good.
Well,
that's
good.
Can
you
believe
it's
tomorrow?
I
don't
know.
-Well,
do
you
want
some
Xanax?
Yeah.
No,
I
think
I'll
just
have
-That'll
do
the
trick.
-Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
There's
another
box
inside.
-I'll
grab
it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
-Jim
seems
like
a
good
guy.
He's
going
to
make
a
great
husband.
You
know,
Julie,
I
was
thinking,
you
know,
with
Dad
not
being
here,
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
anybody
Yeah.
No,
Jim's
uncle
is
going
to
do
it.
He's
been
really
supportive.
He's
been
great.
Well,
good.
That's
great.
I
wanted
you
to
be
covered,
that's
all.
So,
I
should
be
there,
what?
Yeah,
the
guests
and
things
get
going
at
5:30,
Okay.
Let
me...
I'm
going
to
help
you
with
those.
Got
it.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
None
of
that
was
here.
This
is
all
new.
Really?
-Is
that
all
you
got?
Give
me
a
boost.
Watch...
Hang
on.
I
took
Geography
in
here.
You
ever
fool
around
-No.
Did
you?
That's
me
on
the
right.
It's
kind
of
hard
to
tell.
You
can
tell
by
the
eyebrows.
-You
played
basketball?
Don't
act
so
surprised.
I
didn't
know
you
were
such
a
jock.
That's
me,
too.
And
that.
-My
first
fight.
Got
my
ass
kicked.
This
is
where
we
used
to
go
Yes.
Yeah.
This
is
very
romantic.
Go,
Cougars!
I'm
really
happy
I
came
here.
So
am
I.
It's
Kara.
-Hey.
We're
having
a
meltdown
here.
What's
going
on?
What
happened?
It's
Jim.
Can
you
get
back
here?
Okay.
We
got
to
go.
-I'll
grab
your
suit.
-What
happened?
-Today?
-What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
-You
want
me
to
talk
to
him?
You
know
my
track
record.
I
haven't
been
to
bat.
Don't
you
talk
for
a
living?
I
tell
people
how
to
avoid
commitment.
What
kind
of
-It's
a
philosophy.
Hey,
it
could
have
helped
you.
Ryan,
you
haven't
been
around
much.
I
know
you
want
to
be
there
for
her.
Well,
here
it
is.
This
is
your
chance.
Hey.
What's
up,
Ryan?
-Jim.
-Yeah,
it's
pretty
powerful
stuff.
Kara
mentioned
that
I
don't
think
I'm
going
to
be
able
to
do
this.
And
why
would
you
say
that
today?
Well,
last
night
I
was
kind
of
laying
so
I
started
thinking
about
the
wedding
and
about
our
buying
a
house
and
having
a
kid
And
then
Christmas
and
going
to
football
games.
And
then,
they're
getting
jobs,
and,
you
know,
I'm
a
grandparent.
And
then
I'm
retired.
I'm
losing
my
hair.
And
then
the
next
thing
you
know,
I'm
just,
like...
I
can't
stop
from
thinking,
-I
mean,
what
is
the
point?
Yeah,
I
mean,
what
am
I
starting
here?
Jim,
it's
marriage.
It's
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
-You
never
got
married.
-I
mean,
you
never
even
tried.
I
don't
know,
just...
You
seem
happier
Look,
Jim,
I'm
not
going
to
lie
to
you.
And
you're
kind
of
right.
This
all
is
just
-Yes.
and
they
can't
be
slowed
down
and,
you
know,
Yeah.
There
is
no
point.
There
is
no
point.
You
know,
I'm
not
normally
the
guy
If
you
think
about
it,
your
favourite
memories,
the
most
were
you
alone?
No,
I
guess
not.
Hey,
come
to
think
of
it,
last
night,
when
all
this
shit
weren't
you
guys
Yeah,
Julie
went
back
to
the
apartment,
and
I
was
just
by
myself
-Kind
of
lonely?
-Life's
better
with
company.
Everybody
needs
a
co-pilot.
-That
was
a
nice
touch.
-So,
what's
the
mood
like
out
there?
-She's
pretty
pissed?
What
should
I
do?
Go
get
her.
I'm
such
a
fuck-up.
I
love
you
so
much.
Will
you
be
my
co-pilot?
Yes.
Yes.
Welcome
home.
Okay,
this
is
your
stop.
-When
am
I
going
to
see
you?
So
settled.
You're
not
going
to
change
on
me,
No.
Same
guy.
Just
one
address.
This
is
your
final
boarding
call
for
American
Airlines
All
right.
Call
me
when
you
get
lonely.
I'm
lonely.
Some
guy
sits
down
and
our
server
routes
his
session
''Termination
engineers''?
Really?
I
preferred
''terminators,''
Can't
imagine
why.
They
follow
a
workflow
from
a
standard
dismissal
What
are
they
doing
now?
Well,
beta
testing,
role-playing.
Kyle,
you're
running
through
the
events
You
need
to
give
them
time
It's
a
legal
thing.
-Ryan?
This
is
ridiculous.
But,
you
know,
Legal's
really
starting
to
on
this
term
''terminate,''
so...
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
for
today's
challenge
speaker,
Go
get
them.
Last
year,
I
flew
350,000
miles.
The
moon
is
250.
I
want
you
to
imagine
for
a
second
I
want
you
to
feel
the
straps
You
feel
them?
Now
I
want
you
to
pack
it
with
Start
with
the
little
things,
Excuse
me.
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
Okay,
everyone,
just
relax.
-Hey,
you
got
to
sign.
-Okay,
thank
you.
Hey,
you
forgot
to
give
me
So,
I
was
in
the
neighbourhood.
Hey!
Hey,
wait!
Wait,
wait.
-Hey,
honey,
who's
at
the
door?
Alex?
What
were
you
thinking,
What
do
you
mean?
I...
I
didn't
know
you
had
a
family.
Look,
I'm
sorry
I
ruined
your
evening,
but,
I
mean,
you
could
have
seriously
That's
my
family.
That's
my
real
life.
I
thought
I
was
a
part
of
your
real
life.
I
thought
we
signed
up
Try
and
help
me
understand
I
thought
our
relationship
I
mean,
you
are
an
escape.
You're
a
break
from
our
normal
lives.
I'm
a
parenthesis?
I
mean...
What
do
you
want?
You
don't
even
know
what
you
want.
I'm
a
grown-up,
okay?
So,
if
you
would
like
to
see
me
again,
Okay?
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
we
have
Our
pilot
has
just
informed
me
that
we
which
might
not
mean
much
but
means
a
lot
-No.
Congratulations.
-Such
an
amazing
accomplishment.
-Hi,
Captain.
That
seat
taken?
No.
No.
You're
the
youngest
yet
to
hit
10
mil.
-Don't
know
where
you
found
the
time.
Yeah.
Here
you
go.
7th
card
we've
made.
Small
club.
We
really
appreciate
your
loyalty.
You
know
how
many
times
Played
out
the
conversation
Really?
What
did
you
want
to
say?
You
know,
I
don't
remember.
That's
all
right.
It
happens
to
all
of
us.
So,
where
are
you
from?
I'm
from
here.
Hello,
Mr.
Bingham.
-How
did
you
know
it
was
me?
We
reserve
them
for
our
most
loyal
I'd
like
to
transfer
some
of
my
miles.
Can
I
open
up
an
account
Certainly.
How
many
miles
How
many
miles
does
it
take
We
have
our
round-the-world
tickets.
-That'd
be
fine.
I'll
call
you
back.
What
the
hell
happened
I
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
you
all
day.
I
was...
Some
personal
stuff.
Do
you
remember
Karen
Barnes,
part
of
a
30-person
reduction
Natalie
fired
her.
I
fire
dozens
of
people
a
day.
I...
She
killed
herself,
jumped
off
a
bridge.
Fuck.
I
need
to
know
if
you
remember
any
woman
They're
all
depressed.
Hey,
I
need
to
ask
you
this
stuff,
okay?
No,
I
don't
remember
anything.
You
don't
remember
any
woman
-Anything
at
all,
Ryan?
-Natalie
all
right?
-She
quit?
Yeah,
fucking
nice,
right?
-She
say
where
she
was
going?
I
should
give
her
a
call.
I
need
you
back
in
the
air.
Hey,
did
you
hear
what
I
said?
It's
fine.
CTC
is
going
to
pause
They're
going
to
give
it
We
are
going
to
get
doing
what
they
do
best,
okay?
-How
long
are
you
sending
me
out?
You
send
us
a
postcard
So,
what
happened?
-How
exactly
do
you
mean?
You
seemed
to
have
your
pick
Instead
you
went
to
Omaha
-It's
challenging
work.
I
can't
imagine
doing
that
day
in,
Not
in
this
climate.
I
followed
a
boy.
Well,
I
guess
everybody
does
that
This
guy
says
I'd
be
lucky
to
have
you.
To
whom
it
may
concern,
I
can't
even
count
the
number
of
people
So
many
that
I've
actually
forgotten
We've
never
met,
but
I
know
My
advice?
She'll
be
the
best
decision
I
sure
hope
he's
right.
Well,
I
don't
have
a
lot
of
hope,
and
I
really
don't
know
There's
a
lot
of
people
unemployed,
and
I
really
don't
know
when
there's
I
can't
find
much
to
talk
about.
Talk
about
being
proud.
I
think
the
anger
comes
from
the
fact
I
would
say,
you
know,
without
my
friends
and
my
family,
It
would
have
been
a
lot
tougher
if
When
I
wake
up
in
the
morning
that
gives
me
the
sense
of
purpose.
It's
not
all
about
the
money.
It
pays
your
heating
bills,
you
know.
But
it's
not
as...
Doesn't
keep
you
as
Let
me
get
up.
Let
me
get
out.
So,
my
kids
are
my
purpose,
my
family.
Tonight
most
people
by
jumping
dogs
and
squealing
kids.
Their
spouses
will
ask
about
their
day,
The
stars
will
wheel
forth
And
one
of
those
lights,
will
be
my
wingtip
passing
over.
Hi,
Jason.
My
name
is
Kevin,
and
I
recently
lost
my
job.
I
wrote
this
song
as
sort
of
and
having
a
certain
amount
of
anxiety
So,
maybe
you
can
use
it
in
your
movie.
