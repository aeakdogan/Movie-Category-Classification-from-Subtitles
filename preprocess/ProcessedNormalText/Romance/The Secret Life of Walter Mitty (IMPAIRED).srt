it's

as

we
wanted
to
be
candid
some
of

will
be
determined
to
the

uh...
and
we'll
be
deciding
which
of
those
over
the
course
of
the
next

Uh,
also,
we
feel
sad
about
that,
as
you
can
see.

We
are
very
excited
for...
Ted

fun,
this
stage.
Uh-uh.
But
we
do
have
ahead
of
us
the
privilege
the
very
last
issue

we
just
received
a
telegram...
from
Sean

who
has
never,

can't
quite
find

just
now.

can't
find
it?
Yeah,
that's
why
I'm
trying
to
track
him
with,
uh,
these
other
images.
His
whereabouts?
Yeah.
I
take
this
class,
Anyway,
they
say
the
key
is
to
work
backwards.
You
connect
the
clues
and
then
There's,
like,
May
I?
Sure.
Okay.
Thumb.
Yeah,
it's
a...
It's
an
unknown
thumb.

guess?
Okay.
And,
um...
like,
a
curved
piece
of...
some
kind
of
part
of
a
thing.

But,
hey,
you
know,
the
thing
with
clues,
my
teacher
says,
and
then
they'll
connect,
"Oh,
yes,
of
course,

should've
seen

anyway,
I
should
get
back

got
more
clues.
What-what
did
you
find?
There's
a
date
that
Sean
wrote
and
some
words
on
a
cake
wrapper.
"Rajqawee,"
"Buzkashi"
and,
uh,
"Warlocks."
Wait,
they
have
Yeah,
I
just
had
to...
Did
you
get
kicked
out?
No,
I
just
needed
to
leave.

Hey,
I
was
right

Then
I
lost
him.

No.
Rajqawees
means
in,
like,
40
Arabic

And
Buzkashi
is
goat
hockey
in

And,
uh,
"Warlocks..."
Yeah,
um,

was
hoping

So
you
said
because
of
the
cups?
Is
there
something
I
should
No,
I
just,
uh,
I
worked
there,
that's
all.
I
just...

used
to
have

and,
uh,
a

I
guess
this
idea

what
I
wanted
to
do.

There's
no
such
thing
Listen,

If

You're
fired.
Hey!
More

scandal?
Little...
A
little
scandal,
yes.
Uh...
She
was
back
with

just
what's
good
about

out
of
my
head.
MOTHER:
ODESSA:
I
feel
like
it's
good
I
mean,
I'm
not
going
to
get
It's
not
about
money.
And
I
feel
like,
you
know,
it's
just
for
kids,
but
I
think
it's
important
I'm
really
thrilled,
Mom.
You
know,
I
think
I'm
just
Just
standing
in

MOTHER:
You'll

be
good
at

Hey,
Mom?
Did

MOTHER:
With
Sean's
camera.
Sean
O'Connell's
camera?
Yeah,
he
came
to
visit.
Mom,
what?
Yeah.
He
wanted
to
know
about
when
you
left,
He
said
you
really
He
was
really
interested
You...
Mom,
why
didn't
you
tell
me?
I
told
you.
I
told
you
in
the
produce
aisle.
I
remember
that.
Oh,
maybe
you
were...

No,
I
don't
know
where
he
is.
He's
some...
someplace
Warlords.
No,
warlocks.
No.
Warlords.
Sean
said
he
had
to
meet

maybe
he
would
take
my
cake
so
that
he
could
get
permission
to

through

said
he
wants

I
put
it
in
a
little
slot,
the
little

I
thought
it'd
be
cute.
I
told
you,
"Look
inside."
In
the

You
said,
"Look

my
feelings.
No...

liked
it
I
appreciated
it
very
much.
So
you
threw
it
away?
I...
So
you
have
no
idea
what
it
was.
The
photograph.
It's
a
shame.
It
was
a
beauty.

How'd
you
find
me,
anyway?

I
just
saw

He
loves
it,
and
I'm
Cool.
Hey,
I
wanted
you
to
know
you
weren't
boring
me.
That
day
in
the
park...
I-I
was...
I
was
thinking
about...
I
hope
this
doesn't
I
was
thinking
about
you.
When
I
was
in
Greenland...
and
I
had
to
get
with
a
very
drunk
pilot,
and
I
started
to
imagine
you
singing
"Major
Tom."
Anyway,
it
got
me
on
the
helicopter,
and
it
just...
got
me
where
I
wanted
to
go.
So
what
happened
to
you?
You
sort
of
fell
for
a
little
bit.
I
came
by,
and
I...
your
husband
answered,
Uh,
Phil.
He
was
fixing
my
refrigerator,
and
he's
not
my
husband.
I
guess
I
imagined
that...
I
thought
maybe
you
You
have
a
good
imagination,
but
no.
Hey,
my
sister
got
Rizzo.
Not
on

Do
you
want
to
go
with
me?
I
made
that
sound
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah,
yeah.
I
would
love
to.
Grease
in
a
weird
church?
You
kidding?

Rizzo,
that's...
Yeah,
Rizzo.

Tough
and
tender.
Yeah.
Great.
Are
you,
uh...
are
Uh,
uh,
sure.
Yeah?
I
actually
always
Oh,
yeah?
Was
it
the,
uh,
smoking
No,
she
was
just
real,
I
guess.
Oh.
The
last
issue,
It
came
out
this
morning.
