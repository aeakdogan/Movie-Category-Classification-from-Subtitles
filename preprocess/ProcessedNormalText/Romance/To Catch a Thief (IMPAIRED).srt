Invtng

Mss
Stevens,
That's

May
I
ask
a
personal
queston?
What
do
you
expect
to
get
-
More
than
you're
wllng
to
offer.
You're
n
Europe
to
buy
a
husband.
-
The
man
I
want
doesn't
have
a
prce.
You're
rght.
Gve
me
a
woman
No

gves
you

lke
that.

Any
partcular
method?
But
t's
no
good
unless
-
Are
you
sure
ths
s
the
address?
Let
me
see.
Let's
look
at
the
gardens.
Why
don't
you
own
a
place
lke
ths?
Palaces

for
royalty.
We're

That

We're

And

You

I
don't

-
Why
not
nvent
some
hot
damonds?
-
What
do
you
get
a
thrll
out
of
most?
We
were
gong
to
look

the
gardens.
I
was
nterested
n

archtecture.
You

I

marred.
Dd

of

You

Merely
dsappontment
n
your

That

You're

You

You're

You're

You

never
know.
You
need
somethng
I
haven't

And
what
s
that?
Two

I'm

What

pcnc?
Not

Whch

Is

Lonely

secluded?
Then

That's
