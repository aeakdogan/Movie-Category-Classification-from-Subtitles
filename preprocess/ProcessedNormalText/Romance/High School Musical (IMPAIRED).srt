Happy
New
Year's,
ladies.
Gabby,
it's
New
Year's
Eve.
But,
Mom,
I'm
almost
done.
The
teen
party?
I've
laid
out
Can
I
have
my
book
back?
-
Thank
you.

Got
a
guard
in
the
championship
game

Am
I
going
left?

He

take
it
downtown.
Whoo!
That's
it,
man.
Sweet.
-
Boys?
Did
we
really
fly
all
this
way
Yeah.
It's
the
last
night
of
vacation.
The
party,
remember?
Right,
the
party.
Troy,
they
have
a
kid's
party
downstairs
-
Kid's
party?
Come
on.
One
more.
-
Last
one.
There
we
go.


Howdy,
ma'am.
All
right!
How
about
that
-
Yeah!
Who's
gonna
rock
the
house
next?

Huh?

Ha-ha!
Ho-ho!

I
can't
sing.
No,

go.
And
you!
Yeah,
come
on.
Look,
I
don't
sing.
I
can't
sing.
Get
up
there!
Hey,
you
know
what?
Someday
you
guys
Or
not.

#
Living
in
my
own
world
#
Didn't
understand
#
That
anything
can
happen
#
When
you
take
a
chance
#
I
never
believed
in
#
What
I
couldn't
see
-
#
I
never
opened
my
heart
#
To
all
the
possibilities
#
Ooh
-

#
I
know

#
Never
felt
this
way
#
And
right
here
tonight

#
This
could
be
the
start
-
#
It
feels
so
right
#
Oh!

And
now
I'm
lookin'
in
your
eyes

I
feel
in
my
heart
#
The
start
of
something
new

Oh,
yeah
#
Now
who'd
have
ever
thought
that
#
We'd
both
be
here
tonight
-
#
Ooh
-
#
And
the
world
looks
so
much
brighter
-
#
Oh,
with
you
by
my
side
#
I
know
that
something
has
changed,
-
#
I
know
it
for
real

This
could
be
the
start

It
feels
so
right
to
be
here
with
you

Oh!

And
now
looking
in
your

The

-
Troy.
But
seriously,
you
have
an
amazing
voice.
Just
church
choir
is
all.
Really?
Why
is
that?
I
looked
at
the
people
staring
at
me.
Next
-
End
of
solo
career.
That
was
the
first
time
I
did
that.
-
I
know!
Completely!
Yeah,
sure.
My

I
guess
I
better
go
find
my
mom
Yeah,
me
too.
I
mean,
not
your
mom.
Uh...
I'll
call
you.
-
Yeah!
Here.
-
You
too.

There
you
go.
Just
so
you
know,
singing
with
you
So,

do
you
live?
Gabriella.

It's

happy
Wildcat
new
year!
In
two
weeks
with
you
leading
us
-

What
team?
-
What
team?

Ooh!
Whoo-hoo!

Ooh!
The
ice
princess
returned
She
spent
the
holidays
-
How's
that?

Ooh!
Ugh,
behold
the
zoo
animals

Mom,
my
stomach...
Is
nervous
on
first
day
at
a
new
school.
I
made
my
company
promise
that
I
can't
I
reviewed
your
impressive
transcripts.
I
don't
want
to
be
the
school's
Just
be
Gabriella.
This
way.

Troy!
Troy!
Hey!
How's
it
goin'?
How
are
you?
Miss
Darbus?
-
Do
you
remember
the
night
before?
All
I
remember
is
like,
pink
jelly.
I...
Excuse
me.

Ooh!
-
Hi,
Troy.

I
trust
you
all
had
splendid
holidays.
Check
the
sign-up
sheets
in
the
lobby
Especially
our
winter
musicale.
-
You
OK?
-
...and
pairs
auditions
for
our
two
leads.
Mr.
Danforth,
this
is
a
place
of
learning,
There
is
also
a
final
sign-up
for
next
week's
Chem
Club
president
Taylor
McHessey

Ah,
the
cell
phone
menace
-
Is
it
your
phone?
-
I
will
see
you
in
detention.
We
have
zero
tolerance
so
we
will
get
to
know
each
other
And
welcome
to
East
High,
Miss
Montez.
-
So
we
will
see
you
in
detention
as
well.
Your
Honor,
see,
'cause
we
have
Ah,
that
will
be
15
minutes
Could
be
tough
for
Chad.
-
Taylor
McHessey,
15
minutes.
Shall
the
carnage
continue?
Way
over!
-
Jason.
What?

-
Sorry,
man.
See
you
in
detention.
Uhh,
she's
crazy.
Hey!
-
I
don't...
-
Well,
me...
My
mom's
company
transferred
her
I
can't
believe
you
live
here.
I
looked
-
We
had
to
leave
first
thing.
What?
Oh,
uh...
my
friends
I
haven't
quite
told
them
-
What's
up?
-
Too
much
for
them
to
handle?
But,
you
know,
my
friends,
it's,
uh...
That
was,
like,
a
different
person.
So,
uh...
anyway,
welcome
to
East
High.
Now
that
you've
met
Miss
Darbus,
I
won't
be
signing
up
for
anything
for
a
But
if
you
sign
up,
-
Yeah,
yeah.
That's
completely
impossible.
I
wouldn't
think
"impossible"
Oh,
so
nice
of
you
to
Oh,
were
you
going
to
sign
up
too?
have
starred
in
all
the
school's
productions
There
are
a
lot
of
supporting
roles.
No,
no,
no.
I
was
just
looking
at
Lots
going
on
at
this
school.
Wow.
Nice
penmanship.
So,
Troy.
I
missed
you
during
vacation.
You
know,
um...
played
basketball,
-
When's
the
big
game?
You
are
so
dedicated.
I
hope
you
come
watch
me
in
the
musical.
-
Toodles!
Dude,
you
know
that
school
musical
thing?
-
Who
cares?
...for
college...
Think
LeBron
James
or
Shaquille
O'Neal
-
Maybe.
The
music
in
those
shows
isn't
hip-hop,
It's,
like,
show
music.
-
Oh,
dude,
it's
frightening.
-
Sharpay's
kinda
cute,
too.
But
you
don't
pet
it.
All
right,
Wildcats!
Pair
up!
Let's
go!
Come
on!

What
team?
-
What
team?
-
What
team?
-
Wildcats!

So,
it
seemed
like
you
knew
Troy
Bolton.
Not
really.

Well,
Troy
usually
doesn't
-
Uh,
why
not?
-
That
should
be
16
over
pi...
I'm
sorry,
I
was
just...
Uh...
Shouldn't
the
second
equation
16
over
pi?
That's
quite
impossible.
I
stand
corrected.
Oh...
and
welcome
aboard.
-
Catch
you
later,
guys.
Troy
Bolton
was
looking
at
our
audition
list.
Again?
He
was
hanging
around
with
that
new
girl
There's
something
freaky
about
her.

Wow!
An
Einsteinette.
So
why
do
you
think
she's
interested
I'm
not
sure
that
she
is.
And
we
needn't
But...
there
is
no
harm
in
making
certain
that
Gabriella's
welcome
to
...well,
appropriate
for
her.
After
all...
...she
loves
pi.
Gold!
More
gold!
Paint,
paint!
Let's
go!
-
The
answer
is
yes!
Our
scholastic
decathlon
team
and
there
is
certainly
a
spot
for
you.
-
Where
did
those
come
from?
-
Of
course
not.
We
meet
almost
every
day
after
school.
Please?
I
need
to
catch
up
on
the
curriculum
here
Well,
what
a
perfect
way
to
get
caught
up.
-
What
a
generous
offer,
Taylor.
I
hope
you
don't
make
a
habit
of
it,
but
the
drama
club
can
always
use
And
while
we
are
working,
let
us
probe

Come
on,
guys,
huddle
up!
Where's
Troy
and
Chad?
Don't
make
me
ask
again.
-
Where's
Troy
and
Chad?!


Perhaps
the
most
heinous
example
of
What
temerity!
-
A
precious
cornucopia
of
creative
energy.
What
the
heck
are
those
two
It's
called
crime
and
punishment,
Bolton.
Besides,
proximity
to
the
arts
Can
we
have
a
talk,
please?
And
you
two,
in
the
gym,
now!
If
they
have
to
paint
sets
for
detention,
If
these
were
theater
performers,
Darbus,
we
are
days
away
And
we,
Bolton,
are
in
the
midst

school
is
about
more
than
flinging
balls
for
touchdowns!
Baskets!
They
shoot
baskets.
Stop!
Guys,
listen,
since
the
day
you
both
started
We
are
one
school,
one
student
body,
one
faculty!
So,
Coach,
how's
the
team
lookin'?
-
Troy
got
'em
whipped
into
shape?

West
High
Knights
have
knocked
us
out
and
now
we
are
one
game
away
from

time
to
make
our
stand.
The
team
is
you.
You
are
the
team.
unless
each
and
every
one
of
you

Hey,
what
team?!
-
What
team?
-
What
team?
-
Wildcats!
We've
never
made
it
past
the
first
round
of
the
scholastic
decathlon.
I'm
focusing
on
my
studies
this
semester,
and
help
my
mom
get
the
new
house

What
do
you
know
about
Troy
Bolton?
I'm
not
an
expert
however,
unless
you
speak
cheerleader,
as
in,
"Oh,
my
gosh!
Isn't
Troy
Bolton
Oh,
he's
so
beautiful.
-
Ha-ha.
See
what
I
mean?
We
exist
in
an
alternate

you
tried
to
get
to
know
him?
Watch
how
it
works
tomorrow

you'd

nail
beds
are
history.
Sister!
-
Still
don't
understand
this
detention
thing.
-
Sorry,
Dad.
Darbus
will
take
any
opportunity
to
Hey,
Dad?
Did
you
ever
want
to
try
something
new,
Like,
going
left?
You're
doing
fine.
Well...
no.
I
mean,
what
if
you
wanna
and
it's
a
total
disaster
Maybe
they're
not
your
friends.
You
gotta
look
out
for
each
other.
There's
gonna
be
college
scouts
Know
what
a
scholarship
-
A
lot.
Whoo.
Just
something
for
you.

I
expect
we
all
learned
our
homeroom
If
not,
we
have
some
dressing
rooms
Now,
a
few
announcements.
This
morning
during
free
period
will
be
both
single
and
pairs.
I
will
be
in
the
theater
until
noon
the
wingspan
of
your
creative
spirit.
When's
she
due
back
on
the
mother
ship?
Discussing
the
importance

What's
up,
man?
The
team's
hitting
the
gym
during

can't
make
it.
What?
Hello,
it's
only
the
second
day
back.
And
I've
been
behind
on
homework
That's
hilarious.
Homework?
There's
no
way.
-
How's
it
going?
-
Good
to
see
you.
How's
it
going,
man?
Short-cut.
I'm
late
for
class.

That's
good,
just
leave
it
here.

This
is
where
the
true
expression
Where
inner
truth
is
revealed

-
Was
that
a
cell
phone?
-
No,
ma'am.
That
was
the
warning
bell.
Those
wishing
to
audition
must
We
have
many
roles
to
cast
First,
you
will
sing
a
few
bars
and
I
will

your
calling.
Better
to
hear
it

composer,
Kelsi
Nielson,
and
be
available
for
rehearsals
Shall
we?

It's
hard

That

want
you
to

Yes,

you.

I
couldn't
sneeze...

you
were

right
there
Alan,
I
admire
your
pluck.

As
to
your

That's
a
wonderful
tie

up
for
something?

Uh...
No.
You?
Um...
why
are
you
hiding

a
mop?

Right.

Thank

is
a
little...
harsh.

superstar's
afraid?

I'm
just...
scared.

for

of
Minnie

to
give

a

What's
up?

workout

now
suddenly
people
are
confessing.
Yeah,
and

What's
that?

a

custard

It's
really
satisfying.

you

that

You're
thinking
about

Whoa!
Whoa!
-
Ooh!
-
All
right.
Cards
on
the
table
right
now.
You're
tweaked
because
I
put
your
stars
What
are
you
talking
about,
Darbus?
Your
all-star
son
Now,
I
give
every
student
an
even
chance,
which
is
a
long
and
honorable
Something
that
you
wouldn't
understand.
But,
if
he
is
planning
some
sort
of
practical
-
Troy
doesn't
even
sing.
But
I
will
not
allow
my
Twinkle

Twinkle
Town?
-
Hey...
Sounds
like
a
winner.
Is
Sharpay
really,
really
mad
at
me?
Look,
no
one
has
beaten
out
Sharpay
for
I
wasn't
trying
to
beat
anyone
out.
We
didn't
even
audition,
You
won't
convince
Sharpay
of
that.
If
that
girl
could
play

Romeo
and
I
told
you
it
just
happened,
but
I
liked
it.
A
lot.
Did
you
ever
feel
like
there's
just
looking
for
a
way
to
come
out?
Not
really.
No.

Let's
go.
Hey,
Sharpay,
I
thought
since
Troy
Bolton's
Troy
Bolton
is
not
in
my
show.
OK,
um...
well,
I
thought
maybe
-
I'd
rather
stick
pins
in
my
eyes.
Evaporate,
tall
person!
I
bake!
If
that
helps.
-
Wow!
It's
like
a
jungle
up
here.
Well,
I
just
humiliated
myself
into
-
No!
Come
on.
Yeah.
Thanks
to
the
science
club.
Which
You
pretty
much
have
the
school
wired,
Seems
to
me
like
everyone
on
campus
Unless
we
lose.
Well,
I'm
sure
it's
tricky
Makes
me
practice
a
little
harder,
I
don't
know
what
he'll
say
-
You
worried?
"Your
son's
the
basketball
guy.
Sometimes
I
don't
wanna
be
I
just
wanna
be

You
know?
I
saw
the
way
you
treated
Kelsi
at

your

To
them,
I'm

was

coming
here
and
being...

I
was
singing

even

in
kindergarten
how
you'd
meet
then
ten
seconds
later
you
play
because
you
didn't
have
to
-
Yeah.
Well,
uh...
I
never
thought
about
singing.
Till
you.
So
you
really
wanna
do
the
callbacks?
Hey,
just
call
me
freaky
callback
boy.
You're
a
cool
guy,
Troy.
But
not
for
the
reasons
your
friends
think.
And

for
showing
me

I

But
you're

Did
you

be

What?
What

has

It's

always
been
for

All
right
the

is
nothing.
It
means
nothing
to

is
not

I'll

about

forget

happy

when

find
yourself

Looking
from
the

I'm
standing
here

all
I
want

Why
did
I
let
myself
believe

could
happen?

'Cause
now
I
have
to
pretend

I
thought
you
were
my
fairy

A
dream
when
I'm
not
sleeping
#
A
wish
upon
a

that's
coming

everybody
else
could
tell

to
you
about
something.

it
is:
I

what
it's

I
get
it.

about

kid?
I'll
do
the
scholastic
decathlon
It's
where
we
belong.
-
Go,
Wildcats.
Me
neither.

Gabriella?

Go
Wildcats!
Hey,
Captain!
-
What's
with
Troy?


Oh,
hey!
-
Troy!
Hey.
Hey,
um...
We
just
had
another
team
meeting.
Oh...
wonderful.
We
had
a
team
meeting
about
how
I
mean
us,
not
you.
-
About
the
singing
thing...
We
just
want
you
to
know
-
Cheering
for
you.
If
singing
is
what
you
wanna
do,
we
should
boost
you
up,
Yeah.
Win
or
lose,
we're
teammates.
That's
what
we're
about.
Even
if
you
turn
Which
we
don't
know,
because
we
You're
not
gonna
hear
me
sing,
guys.
Because
Gabriella
won't
even
talk
to
me...
...and
I
don't
know
why.
We
do.
I
baked
these
fresh
today.
You'll
probably
want
to
try
one
Gabriella,
we
were
jerks.
No,
we
were
worse
than
jerks
We
thought
Troy
killing
our
chances
of
having
you
I
heard
what
he
had
to
say.
No,
not
done.
We
knew
that
Chad
could
get
to
make
you
want
to
We
planned
it,
No
one
forced
Troy
to
say
anything.
We
should
prepare
for
the
decathlon,
No,
it's
not
OK.
The
decathlon
is
whatever,
but
how
you
-
that's
what
really
matters.

We
tried.

Hi,
uh...
Just
came
to
say
I'm
sorry.
-
Hi,
Miss
Montez,
I'm
Troy
Bolton.

No.
Um...
Gabriella
is
kind
of
busy
with
I
made
a
mistake,
Miss
Montez,
and
I
-
Could
you
tell
her
I
came
by
to
see
her?
-
Good
night.



-
Hello?
I
was
sick
of
my
friends
riding
me,
I
didn't
mean
any
of
it.
You
sounded
pretty
convincing
to
me.
The
guy
you
met
on
vacation
is
more
me
The
whole
singing
thing
You
said
so
yourself.
Everyone's
Maybe
because
I
don't
wanna
They
can't
handle
it.
-
How
about
your
dad?
This
is
about
how
I
feel,
They
let
me
down.
So
I'm
gonna
sing.
What
about
you?
-
I
don't
know,
Troy.
Because
I
brought
you
something.
What
do
you
mean?
Turn
around.
#
This
could
be
the
start
of
something
new
#
It
feels
so
right
to
be
here
with
you
#
Oh
#
And
now
lookin'
in
your
eyes
#
I
feel
in
my
heart
#
The
start
of
something...
...new
It's
a
pairs
audition.

Whoo.
Yeah!
Zn4,
and
by
doing
that,
...and
two.
Got
it?
Yes!
What's
happening?
Come
here.
Go
ahead
and
that
causes
it
to
change
Causing
the
color
to
change
from
Just
like
those
pH
strips.
Oh,
gotta
go.
See
you
guys
later!
Whoa!

Like
a
wave
the
ocean
just...
We
have
to
do
something.
OK,
our
callbacks
on
Thursday
and
the
basketball
game
Too
bad
all
these
events
weren't
...at
the
same
time.
That
wouldn't
work
out
because
then
Troy
I'm
proud
to
call
you
my
sister.
I
know.

I
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
So,

your
inhibitions

Stomp,

And
the
scholastic
decathlon.
