.
and
recognized
you
right
off.
What
were
you
doing
with
my
husband?
You
know,
Beecham
is
on
the
other
side
and
it
was
always
incorporated
...between
1936
and
now,
Why,
that's
terrible.
It's
nothing.
I
gave
your
husband
his
$2
back...
and
you
don't
lose
a
cent
-
You
just
get
married
again.
Mother,
don't
get
excited.
It's
really
nothing,
Mrs.
Krausheimer.
Nothing?
How
does
it
look?
Don't
worry,
David
will
do
all
right
-
How
do
you
know?
and
wants
us
to
have
dinner
for
two
-
He'll
marry
me
tonight.
Can
I
drive
you
somewhere?
Thanks,
Mrs.
Krausheimer.
Give
my
love
to
Bertha
Thanks.
And
goodbye,
Annie.
I
do
hope
everything
will
be
all
right.
-
Mother,
what
are
you
talking
about?
-
Lf
nothing
happens.
Goodbye.
Lily?
You
know
that
little
bolero
suit
I
was
married
in
that
suit,
-
Isn't
that
wonderful?
Get
it,
Lily.
Inhale,
Mrs.
Smith.
I
can't
understand
anything
hanging
shrinking
so
much.
-
How
are
you?
Mrs.
Smith's
here.
Hello,
darling.
I
thought
you
weren't
going
to
buy
You
look
kind
of
cute.
I
can't
wait
to
see
Momma...
-
Do
you
think
we'll
get
the
same
table?
It'll
be
covered
in
a
checkered
tablecloth...
and
there'll
be
a
candle
And
Rosa,
the
fortune
teller.
You
know,
Either
our
noses
have
changed...
or
they've
built
a
livery
stable
It's
not
exactly
Chanel
No.
5.
Let's
go
in.
The
place
has
changed
a
little.
Customers.
Is
Momma
Lucy
here?
I
am
Momma
Lucy.
You've
changed
a
little,
too.
She
went
back
to
the
old
country.
Wait
a
minute.
We'd
like
to
eat
here.
You
want
to
eat
here?
Yes,
if
you
haven't
any
objections.
If
you've
got
no
objection,
Where
you
like
to
sit?
We
used
to
come
here
years
ago
Would
it
be
too
much
trouble
Are
you
going
to
have
a
45-cent
-
Sixty-five.
Table
cloth
isn't
checkered.
It's
dirty
enough
so
it
looks
checkered.
Candle
stuck
in
the
beer
bottle
Haven't
they
ever
seen
anybody
Let's
just
outstare
them.
Eat
your
soup,
dear.
-
There's
something
wrong
with
that
soup.
Why
doesn't
the
cat
eat
the
soup?
Animals
know
what's
good
for
them.
-
The
pits,
too.
Make
the
best
of
it.
That
cat
knows
something.
Where
shall
we
go
after
this?
Home.
Aren't
we
supposed
to
go
someplace
Altogether,
it
would
make
it
too
late.
I'd
give
$5
to
see
that
cat
-
David?
Tell
me
what
you
do
a
day
in
the
office,
From
the
time
you
came
in
Just
a
lot
of
schmooze.
No,
it
isn't.
I'm
very
interested.
Who
did
you
see?
Let
me
see.
Oh,
yes.
Some
sucker
came
in
Another
guy
wanted
me
to
rub
out
a
name
And
that's
about
all.
I
spent
Things
pile
up
in
three
days.
I
wonder
if
he'll
take
a
little
soup.
Come
on.
No?
No,
he
won't.
Doesn't
that
mean
something?
I
want
a
stomach
pump.
-
Nice
cat,
eh?
I'm
unlucky
with
cats
here.
The
third
cat
this
week.
They
get
run
over.
I
think.
-
Your
name
Mrs.
Smith?
Your
mother
is
in
the
kitchen.
On
the
phone.
It
must
be
about
our
Red
Cross
group.
Hello,
Mother.
Not
exactly.
He's
teasing
me.
Mother,
are
you
crying?
My
poor
baby.
Listen
to
me.
Under
no
conditions,
do
you
hear
me,
Why,
Mother,
of
course
not!
Yes,
Mother.
Worse
comes
to
worst,
Good
night,
my
love.
Everything
all
right?
Darling,
I
have
a
little
secret
to
tell
you.
It's
about
time.
What
is
it,
dear?
You're
a
great
kid.
It's
getting
rather
late
if
you
know
what
I
mean.
I
get
it.
Waiter,
check.
Glasses,
dear.
Don't
want
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle,
Get
going,
Annie.
Keep
twirling
it,
honey.
You
beast,
you
know
we're
not
married.
-
I
was
going
to
tell
you
later.
There's
no
need
in
going
on
like
this.
You
were
going
to
wait
until...
And
then
throw
me
aside
Don't
dramatize
this.
I've
given
you
the
best
years
of
my
life,
Mother
and
I
were
always
suspicious.
-
Let
me
say...
-
But,
Annie,
l...
Go
on,
you're
not
staying
here.
We
can't
leave
the
bedroom
-
You're
not
in
the
bedroom.
Get
out!
I
know
you
for
what
you
are.
-
You're
going
out
of
here.
Never
come
back.
I
never
want
to
see
you
again
What
are
you
doing?
-
Good
evening,
Mr.
Smith.
Have
you
a
room
I'm
sure
we
have.
Don't
remember
you
spending
a
night
here
Here
you
are,
sir.
Look
out.
-
Are
you
hurt?
Chuck
Benson.
Don't
you
remember
me?
We
played
in
a
foursome
-
Yeah.
How
are
you?
I've
got
kind
of
a
little
crick
in
my
neck...
and
I
thought
this
might
work
it
out.
I
had
a
fight
with
my
wife,
too.
It
wasn't
exactly
a
fight.
You
know
what
I
can't
understand?
Whenever
people
fight,
But
when
my
wife
and
I
have
a
fight,
How
do
you
get
back?
Simplest
thing
in
the
world.
Ignore
it.
Ignore
the
whole
thing.
Take
it
from
me,
brother.
You're
right.
Just
go
to
the
office,
don't
even
telephone.
She
worries,
why
don't
I
come
back?
And
when
I
do
get
back,
why...
Thank
you,
Joe.
-
What
can
I
do
for
you?
-
What's
this?
Open
it
up.
-
Miss
Krausheimer's
not
at
home.
Open
that
up
or
I'll
fire
you.
You're
not
firing
me.
I
know
how
you've
been
acting
and
all
I
can
say
of
what
she's
done
What
about
my
pen?
Thank
you
for
a
wonderful
evening.
-
I'll
take
you
upstairs.
-
I
had
a
wonderful
time.
Good
night.
No,
Mr.
Flugle.
-
They
can't
rule
you
out
for
trying.
Better
luck
next
time.
Good
night.
Open
that
door.
I
know
you're
in
there.
This
is
ridiculous.
I
saw
you
I'm
not
going
to
stand
for
this.
There's
your
pen.
Annie,
you
open
that
door.
When
they
come
back
a
second
night,
Go
on.
-
Now...
Are
you
going
to
stop
this
silly
farce?
I've
got
a
lot
of
work
piled
up
for
me
I've
been
through
a
3-day
session
and
I
haven't
any
more
time
Come
home
now,
Very
generous.
-
My
wife.
Are
you
out
of
your
mind?
What
do
you
mean,
after
three
years,
-
Legally,
we're
not
married.
-
Does
that
satisfy
you?
That's
a
nice,
snarly
proposal.
It
was
hard
enough
getting
me
to
But
I
do
now.
And
how
I
know
you.
What's
the
matter
with
me?
I
don't
want
this
discussion
Name
one
thing
about
me
you
don't
like.
One
thing?
My,
aren't
we
vain.
One
thing
I
am
not
is
vain.
What
about
that
tar
stuff
that
smells
up
my
whole
bedroom?
I
am
only
trying
to
save
my
hair
for
you.
going
to
bed
with
those
aluminum
clips
You
turned
over
one
night
You
needn't
worry.
I'm
not
gonna
stand
any
more
of
this,
Nice
to
have
met
you.
I
won't
support
you.
Fine.
No.
I
mean
it.
Who
asked
you?
I
want
you
to
know
Suits
me.
Keep
the
change.
You're
not
being
very
practical.
I
said,
how
do
you
think
-
Good
morning.
-
Are
you
looking
for
something?
-
Can
I
help
you?
No.
I'll
find
it
myself.
I
might
be
able
to
save
you
trouble.
No.
I'd
just
rather
run
across
it
myself.
-
Something
in
ladies'
lingerie?
Don't
tell
me.
It's
a
game
I'm
playing.
That's
perfectly
all
right.
I
see
you.
You
might
as
well
come
up.
-
Anything
I
can
do
for
you,
sir?
Please
do
me
a
favor
and
come
home.
I'm
supposed
to
be
in
court
this
morning.
You
have
the
wrong
department.
Will
you
come
peacefully,
The
most
wonderful
feature
of
these,
-
You
merely
throw
them
away.
No!
Leave
me!
What
are
you
doing
to
the
customer?
I'm
not
doing
anything.
Release
our
sales
clerk.
Do
you
want
to
try
If
you're
not
pleased
with
this
clerk,
I'm
pleased
with
her,
but
she's
no
clerk.
-
I
am
not.
As
an
aid
to
the
unemployment
crisis,
-
And
quite
right,
too.
She's
married
all
right.
-
We
have
to
go
to
the
head
of
the
firm.
-
Let's
all
go.
This
gentleman
claims
he's
married
-
We're
not
married.
You
understand
it
is
not
our
policy
I
told
her
that.
-
I
tell
you,
we
are
not
married.
-
Where
did
you
meet
this
monkey?
That's
the
last
time
-
I
never
liked
her.
She
is
not,
you
old
goat.
What
do
you
mean
the
night
before
you
give
them
a
job?
-
I'm
not
innocent.
-
I
didn't
admit
anything.
-
Sit
down.
Yes.
I'll
get
the
store
detectives.
Are
you
satisfied
now?
I
have
an
appointment
at
the
office.
No.
I'm
not
going
For
heaven's
sake,
I
said
that
if
I
had
to
do
it
all
over
again,
Now
I
can
do
it
all
over
again,
Doesn't
that
convince
you
I
believe
you,
and
I'm
very
flattered,
-
I'm
not
interested.
I
don't
like
your
temper.
You're
jealous.
If
you're
referring
to
New
Year's
Eve...
that
drunk
didn't
have
any
right
I
showed
you
both
my
garters.
-
After
you'd
gotten
Julie's
garters.
-
They
were
Julie's
garters.
I
know
they
weren't
yours.
Do
you
two
have
a
license
What
do
you
mean,
license?
Go
on
and
hit
him,
why
don't
you?
I
wouldn't
advise
your
friend
Officer,
I'm
on
your
side.
Beat
it,
buddy.
You
go
this
way.
Go
on,
scatter.
Break
it
up.
Wait.
You
can't
do
this
to
me.
Come
in.
Hello,
David.
I
postponed
the
Amanda
case
for
you...
and
set
back
the
Duffy
hearing...
and
asked
for
a
continuance
That's
fine.
Just
fine.
I'd
like
to
ask
you
to
do
something.
I'll
get
my
work
cleaned
up
I
can't
seem
to
get
my
mind
That's
all
right.
You
don't
know
Sure.
Anything
you
want.
You
know.
I'd
like
to
have
you
drop
in
after
dinner.
What
do
you
mean?
I
took
matters
in
my
own
hands
She's
fond
of
me,
I
think
I
can
straighten
this
thing
out.
I
hope
it
is
something
I
can
straighten
out.
It's
nothing
at
all.
It's
nothing
at
all,
really.
I
imagined
it
was
that.
I'd
like
to
have
you
at,
shall
we
say,
9:00?
That's
all
right.
-
You're
the
best
friend
a
man
ever
had.
You're
the
best
partner
a
man
ever
had.
We
were
school
chums.
You're
the
best
fullback
I
thought
Henkel
was
great...
but
Henkel
couldn't
touch
you.
Thanks,
David.
-
May
I
come
in?
It's
all
right.
Hello,
Ann.
David,
I
want
you
to
talk
to
my
lawyer.
Your
lawyer?
What
lawyer?
Ann
has
asked
me
What
for?
I've
been
telling
her
I'll
say
she
doesn't.
She
just
told
me
all
about
it,
you
two
aren't
married
at
all.
-
There
you
are.
So
there's
nothing
for
the
court
to
decide.
It
happened
before,
They
threw
it
out
of
the
Supreme
Court.
What's
the
matter
with
you?
He
said
you're
lucky
it
isn't
the
South,
Why,
you
hillbilly
ambulance
chaser.
Now,
there's
no
need
to
lose
our
temper.
We're
married.
That's
just
as
good.
It's
better.
I
don't
deny
there's
Tell
him
the
whole
thing.
The
woman
is
given
the
benefit
out
of
such
a
relationship.
as
a
wife,
she's
entitled
Great.
When
I
die,
she'll
get
the
furniture.
You're
entitled
to
hold
yourself
forth
I
am
holding
myself
forth
as
the
husband.
I
wish
you'd
tell
me
something
Should
the
woman,
however,
and
marry
someone
else,
Peterson
v.
Peterson,
Adams
v.
Kelly...
and
Gimbel
v.
You
are
supposed
to
be
my
best
friend,
I
have
never
taken
advantage
and
it's
only
that
I
can
now
ask
Ann.
Would
you
have
dinner
I'm
asking
you
to
come
to
your
senses
If
you
have
dinner
with
him,
this
is
final.
What
time?
We're
through.
That's
not
necessary.
-
Is
the
Florida
Club
all
right?
-
I'll
call
for
you
at
8:00.
-
Good
night,
Jeff.
-
Good
night,
Ann.
Comparing
yourself
to
Henkel
You
couldn't
carry
Henkel's
water
bucket.
Good
night,
David.
-
You
understand?
-
Who
is
it?
Just
a
minute.
Good
night,
David.
Your
nose
is
bleeding.
Are
you
sure
that
stuff
is
good
Best
thing
in
the
world.
I
always
use
it.
I
don't
know.
I
use
it
for
everything.
Yeah.
Oh,
boy!
I
guess
I
am
a
kind
of
a
dummy.
The
last
thing
in
the
world
I
should
do
Leave
her
alone
for
a
week
or
10
days.
She's
used
to
me.
She
can't
get
to
sleep
until
I
get
home.
I'll
have
fun
for
a
couple
of
nights.
Gloria?
I
thought
there
was
a
woman
in
here.
Hiya,
Gloria.
And
I'm
kissing
you
back.
Jimmy?
This
is
no
Jimmy,
this
is
Chuckie.
Been
missing
your
Chuckie,
honey?
She's
a
wonderful
girl.
How
about
tomorrow
night?
Attagirl.
Listen,
I
got
a
friend.
How
about
Gertrude?
-
You'll
like
Gertrude.
He's
a
wonderful
fella.
Did
you
ever
see
the
girl
Is
she
as
good-looking
as
that?
Gertrude,
I
got
a
nice
little
dinner
partner
but
he
kind
of
needs
cheering
up.
She
wants
to
talk
to
you.
Hello?
-
She's
kissing
at
me.
-
I
don't
know
her.
It
feels
kind
of
silly.
How
do
you
know
you're
crazy
about
me?
It's
just
an
ordinary
voice.
I
used
to
sing
a
little.
Didn't
I
tell
you?
He's
a
great
fella.
8:00?
Where
do
we
make
it?
The
Florida
Club.
How
about
the
Florida
Club?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Wait
till
you
see
her.
What
has
Gertrude
got
to
do
with
Camels?
She
smokes
them.
But
you
said
something
about
She
looks
like
that
girl.
She
likes
my
voice.
That
isn't
all
she'll
like.
Yes,
I'll
take
care
of
that,
Mr.
Rondell.
I'll
be
there
in
a
minute.
Mr.
Chuck
Benson's
party.
Yes,
sir.
They're
expecting
you.
Not
there,
Davey.
Not
there.
Davey,
my
boy.
The
one
and
only!
Here
he
is,
kids,
in
the
flesh.
What's
been
keeping
you?
Hello,
there.
What's
held
you
up,
Davey?
The
girls
have
been
waiting
here
for
you
I've
been
a
little
busy
at
the
office.
No,
not
there.
That
doesn't
go
there.
This
is
Gertie,
here.
Gloria
O'Day
and
Gertie
Schultz,
How
do
you
do?
What
are
you
gonna
have
to
drink?
-
Try
an
Old
Fashioned.
Waiter,
bring
us
another
Old
Fashioned.
Isn't
it
a
little
crowded
in
here?
Couldn't
we
go
someplace
-
maybe
a
little
darker?
We'll
go
to
one
of
them
dark,
-
We're
eating
first.
You
ever
been
here?
That's
why
I
wanted
to
go
someplace
I
don't
get
it.
It's
awfully
hot
in
here.
Don't
rush
it.
-
Say,
Davey,
a
couple
more
hours
of
this...
Your
pheasant,
madame.
-
Dish
it
out.
I'm
starved.
-
Remember
to
take
the
feathers
off.
David's
here.
Yes,
so
I
see.
Who's
he
with,
I
wonder?
So
you
wanna
wrestle,
huh?
She's
rather
pretty,
isn't
she?
No,
I
don't.
-
I
want
to
dance.
-
Would
you
care
to
dance,
dear?
You're
looking
for
trouble,
buddy.
You
know
what
this
pheasant
is?
Nothing
but
chicken,
$3
for
this,
with
a
couple
of
French
fries.
Gertie
doesn't
seem
to
like
the
food
here.
It's
getting
better.
Relax.
I
think
Gertie's
right.
We
should've
ordered
some
chop
suey.
What's
the
matter,
baby?
-
No,
I'd
like
some
chop
suey.
-
Waiter,
bring
us
some
ketchup.
Then
scrape
the
gravy
off.
I
still
think
Just
eat
it
up,
honey.
Maybe
Davey
Yeah?
Swell.
-
Eat
it
up.
My
nose
has
started
bleeding.
-
That's
all
right.
I
can
stop
a
nosebleed.
-
Just
lie
right
down.
-
Chum,
give
me
a
hunk
of
ice,
will
you?
Just
take
it
easy.
I
know
how
to
stop
that.
I
used
to
fix
two
of
these
a
night
Why
don't
you
try
-
Good
idea.
Don't
talk.
Waiter,
put
that
chicken
back
It's
nothing,
folks.
He
should've
ordered
chop
suey,
too.
I
knew
the
way
he
was
acting
Maybe
he
saw
something
Come,
Ann.
-
Give
me
another
knife.
This
one's
hot.
Just
cut
my
throat
with
it.
-
Lf
you're
upset,
I'll
gladly
take
you
home.
Because
I
saw
David
I
don't
care
who
holds
a
knife
to
him...
although
I'd
certainly
like
Is
there
someplace
you'd
like
to
go?
Yes.
I
feel
like
staying
up
all
night
tonight.
I
know.
Let's
go
to
the
fair.
Good
idea.
I
was
never
so
happy
in
all
my
life.
Wonderful!
So
happy
and
carefree.
They're
being
very
clever.
We
are
stuck.
That's
what
I
thought.
-
Why
don't
they
do
something
about
it?
It's
much
better
to
stay
where
we
are.
-
You're
soaked
through.
-
You're
catching
cold.
You
know
what
David
does
He
goes
to
bed
a
quart
of
brandy,
You
ought
to
see
him
in
bed
The
moment
we
get
down,
and
get
you
into
some
dry
clothes.
My
apartment?
Excuse
me.
What
a
beautiful
room.
No
wonder
you've
never
gotten
married.
-
Who
did
it
for
you,
Jeff?
-
Do
you
like
the
color
scheme?
David
couldn't
even
tell
you
He
could
be
living
in
a
tent.
It's
the
most
tasteful
man's
bedroom
Thank
you.
What
about
your
hair?
Don't
worry
about
it.
Would
you
excuse
me?
I'm
going
to
get
Is
that
your
idea
I
only
have
one
dinner
coat.
Don't
tell
me
you
expect
This
hasn't
been
Don't
you
ever
think
about
yourself?
What
you
need,
young
man,
I
feel
fine,
really.
Two
big
swallows
of
this,
there'll
be
There.
Now,
sit
right
over
there.
-
Is
that
for
me?
I
don't
drink
liquor.
I
just
keep
it
for
David.
-
And
friends.
I
haven't
anything
against
but
I
just
never
seem
to
get
around
-
I
eat
four
different
vegetables
a
day.
When
I
was
a
young
fella,
and
it
was
very
instructive.
This
man
was
explaining
and
there
was
a
drunk
in
the
audience
Finally,
the
lecturer
asked
the
drunk
When
he
got
there,
Do
you
know
what
he
did?
He
took
an
eyedropper
full
of
whiskey
You
never
heard
such
hollering
Of
course,
his
whole
eye
got
inflamed,
that
the
lining
in
your
stomach...
is
exactly
the
same
composition
I've
never
been
able
to
forget
that.
It's
rather
a
dirty
trick.
Then
you
know
what
happened?
The
drunk
left
the
hall
and
went
up
on
the
platform
-
And
do
you
know
what
he
did?
He
jammed
a
whole
handful
and
said
to
the
audience:
"That's
what
corn
crinkles
do
It
served
him
right.
This
isn't
alcohol,
it's
medicine.
-
Lf
you
think
I
ought
to...
Don't
you
feel
it?
No.
I've
tried
this
before,
I
don't
mind
the
taste
of
it.
Only
thing
is,
because
unfortunately
strong,
silent
men
I
never
saw
anyone
hold
it
as
well.
I
don't
think
one
is
going
I
think
another
one
would
be
a
mistake.
It's
just
medicine.
It
kills
the
germs.
All
in
one
gulp,
now.
Your
good
health.
What
a
constitution.
Maybe
that
second
one
was
too
much.
Miss
Ann...
may
I...
beg
your
leave
for
a
moment?
Certainly.
Are
you
feeling
all
right?
You
come
right
over
here
and
sit
down.
-
I
wouldn't
want
to
get
bold.
That's
right.
Right
over
here.
I'll
sit
right
over
here.
My
only
fear
is
that
I
may
not
act
I
always
say
when
he's
had
one
drink
too
many.
Do
you
know
the
basic
difference
You
give
him
one
too
many,
And
you,
Jeff,
you
lean
backwards.
Thank
you.
I'll
tell
you
something
else.
for
just
one
little
suspicious
move
There
isn't
one
man
in
a
thousand...
who
wouldn't
take
out
a
girl
No
matter
how
faint,
And
look
how
wonderfully
you're
acting.
Thank
you.
The
very
first
time
I
went
out
with
David,
He
was
just
awful.
Didn't
change
I
used
to
think
I
tried
changing
his
diet
around
Thank
you.
I
had
a
wonderful
evening.
You
cover
up
warm
in
bed
You'll
feel
much
better
in
the
morning.
I
intend
taking
you
home,
Ann.
-
Absolutely
not,
Jeff.
-
Good
night.
You're
probably
dying
to
kiss
me,
-
That's
true.
I
have
a
cold.
That's
very
considerate.
Thank
you.
That's
another
difference
Colds
never
stopped
him.
How
I
didn't
get
the
measles
Good
night,
Jeff.
Good
night,
Ann.
Here
we
go
again.
I
hope
she's
not
going
to
visit
her
mother
-
I
don't
think
so.
This
is
like
driving
private.
-
You're
getting
paid,
aren't
you?
-
I
gave
you
$20
day
before
yesterday.
I'll
pay
you
later.
Don't
lose
her.
How
did
you
ever
become
My
whole
family
are
private
detectives.
This
must
be
costing
her
husband
-
You
want
to
hear
my
opinion?
You
ain't
gonna
catch
her
at
anything.
I
don't
know.
-
You
know
what
we
ought
to
do?
Let's
go
to
a
burlesque
show.
This
dame
ain't
gonna
-
In
the
afternoons
is
when
you
catch
them.
-
That's
funny.
Where
does
my
wife
go
every
afternoon?
Look,
she's
going
to
visit
me.
-
Good
morning.
-
Someone's
waiting
for
you.
Mr.
Smith,
it's
about
time.
-
How
do
you
do,
Mister...
I'm
a
client
of
yours.
I
paid
you
a
$1,000
retainer
fee
-
My
name
is
Conway.
Won't
you
sit
down?
I
made
up
my
mind
I
was
going
to
see
you
-
And
it
has.
Where
were
you?
We've
got
your
brother-in-law
If
you'll
lie
down,
I'll
get
the
files.
My
name
is
Conway.
I've
been
sleeping
here
so
much,
-
Where's
my
wife?
Mr.
Custer's
parents
surprised
him.
The
truth
is,
we're
going
to
Lake
Placid.
We
always
talked
about
a
vacation
But
we
didn't
know
there'd
be
nearly
Is
there
no
chance
-
They're
all
in
there?
What
about
Mr.
Conway?
Hello,
Jeff.
Excuse
me.
About
poor
old
Conway...
his
brother-in-law
has
him
where
it
hurts.
-
Why,
you're
David
Smith.
David
Smith.
My
parents.
How
do
you
do,
sir?
I'm
glad
to
see
you.
The
pleasure
is
all
mine.
We
know
so
much
about
you.
You're
like
one
of
the
family.
-
We
met
some
time
ago.
You've
probably
seen
a
great
deal
of
her.
Yes,
I
have.
A
great
deal.
I
hope
I'm
not
interrupting
anything.
Sit
right
down,
boy.
Mother
and
I
have
just
met
Miss
Ann...
and
we
find
out
now
David
probably
knows
it
better
Yes,
if
it
hadn't
been
for
me,
-
That's
so
romantic.
No,
not
exactly...
but
I
had
a
relative
in
the
Civil
War
A
great
many
Northerners
saw
it
that
way,
-
You
know
what
I
was
thinking?
If
two
people
wanted
to
go
on
honeymoon,
and
motor
right
up
through
the
South
-
A
boat's
a
wonderful
place
for
two
people.
That
wouldn't
be
good
for
Ann.
She
was
very
sick
She's
not
a
very
good
sailor.
I
can
give
you
some
good
practical
Whenever
she
gets
on
a
boat,
Put
her
to
bed,
and
hold
it
there,
It
settles
her
stomach.
He
considers
himself
Yes.
How
do
you
like
New
York?
Fine.
It's
so
big,
though,
That's
rather
deceiving.
There
are
a
thousand
and
one
little
things
That
reminds
me.
What
about
my
laundry?
I
haven't
any
more
shorts.
Ann
kind
of
took
care
of
his
things
Little
household
things.
One
of
the
best
housekeepers
I
suppose
you're
wondering
about
us.
I've
known
Ann
for
a
long
time
Still
do,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
-
I
see.
I
know
of
no
finer
compliment
When
a
man's
been
sitting
from
the
same
woman
and
still
wants
to
marry
her,
Jeff,
may
I
see
you
in
private,
please?
-
Excuse
us,
please.
Excuse
me
a
minute,
Ann.
-
We
can
go
in
here,
Father.
What
kind
of
white
trash
-
I
know
it
sounded
very
confusing.
What's
she
doing
with
a
bottle
-
Sending
his
shorts
to
the
laundry?
-
They
had
a
peculiar
relationship.
-
Not
exactly.
The
plumbing
isn't
very
good
Don't
jump
to
any
conclusions
about
Ann.
Are
you
satisfied
now?
To
take
two
fine
people
like
that...
whose
lives
are
wrapped
up
in
their
son
-
What
about
me
being
unhappy?
How
could
you
have
associated
and
not
gotten
some
of
his
fine
qualities?
-
What's
fine
about
them?
You're
in
one
That's
been
the
trouble
And
since
when
have
you
been
so
crazy
Shall
I
recall
to
you
how
I
got
this?
When
you
get
to
know
Ann...
you'll
find
she's
everything
Can't
you
get
an
office
I'm
going
to
bring
Ann
up
to
Lake
Placid
Maybe
we're
being
too
hasty,
Ashley.
We'll
make
reservations
for
the
children.
I
don't
want
to
seem
too
harsh.
All
right,
Jefferson,
How
do
you
do?
-
Is
it
too
late
to
go
skiing?
We'll
hurry.
Just
make
an
"X,"
Jeff.
Mr.
Custer,
I
have
a
message
for
you
They're
on
an
excursion
trip
on
the
lake.
They
won't
be
able
to
get
back
The
snow's
blocked
all
the
roads.
I
see.
-
What
floor
are
we
on?
I
thought
they
were.
-
They
were
changed
to
one
of
the
cabins.
I'm
sure
you'll
find
it
very
satisfactory.
There's
more
privacy,
That'll
be
all
right,
Jeff.
How
far
is
it
from
here?
It's
only
half
a
mile,
and
the
sleigh
It
gives
you
quite
an
appetite.
-
They're
not
connecting
rooms,
are
they?
I
guess
we
better
stay
here
for
lunch
Yes.
Boy,
they'll
be
in
Cabin
McKinley.
-
Each
cabin
is
named
after
a
president.
Clean,
cold
air.
I
love
the
smell
of
snow.
-
No
one
can
smell
the
snow.
It
isn't
snow.
Those
two
bags
go
in
one
room,
Pardon
me.
Don't
catch
cold,
now.
-
There
you
are,
boys.
Phone
when
you
want
dinner,
The
sleigh
service
So
are
the
telephones.
That
suits
me.
A
man
has
no
right
-
Someone
else
has
the
other
suite.
Well,
on
with
our
skis.
Why,
it's
David.
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
He's
fainted.
-
He's
terribly
ill.
Don't
let
him
soak
here.
Carry
him
inside.
Easy,
Jeff.
Ann,
would
you
hold
his
arms?
-
But
you...
Then
maybe
I
can
do
it.
Let
me
see,
now.
Ann,
you
hold
his
legs.
All
right.
That's
fine.
Too
heavy
for
you,
honey?
No.
I
guess
I
better
go
first.
Easy,
Jeff.
One
step,
honey.
Set
his
legs
down,
honey.
Let's
rest
a
minute.
All
right?
Now
we've
got
him.
Easy.
I
better
go
first.
Mind
the
stairs,
now.
That's
fine.
Careful.
That's
a
girl.
In
here.
Mind
the
chair.
I
better
go.
Hang
on.
Swing.
One,
two,
three!
This
is
his
room.
He
doesn't
seem
to
be
breathing.
Don't
worry,
now.
Control
yourself.
-
He's
frozen.
He's
blue
with
cold.
Maybe
he
ought
to
have
a
little
brandy.
No,
I'm
afraid
not.
Yes,
I
can
see
he's
been
at
it
all
week.
-
A
few
hours'
sleep
will
bring
him
around.
We
better
get
these
wet
clothes
off
him.
Come
on
now,
old
man.
That's
fine.
We
will
go
away
What's
he
saying?
We
were
supposed
to
come
here
You'll
be
crazy
about
it,
Ann.
He
must've
been
here
the
whole
week,
He
shouldn't
have
come
here.
Playing
in
the
snow.
Let's
get
these
wet
things
off
him.
Look
out!
You'll
fall.
He
thinks
we're
skiing.
You're
very
graceful,
Ann.
Just
don't
go
so
fast
the
next
time.
Isn't
that
terrible?
Look
out!
Look
out
for
that
tree!
-
You
better
go
to
your
room
now.
-
I
want
to
get
him
undressed.
If
you
need
me,
call
me.
The
first
two
weeks
in
December.
Take
a
little
walk
in
the
snow,
He'll
get
delirious
again
and
want
water.
He's
sleeping
like
a
baby.
I
think
I'll
look
once
more.
He's
asleep.
He's
trying
to
say
something.
The
first
two
weeks
in
December.
What's
he
saying?
He's
still
at
the
first
two
weeks
He's
opening
his
eyes.
Hello,
David.
Hello,
Ann.
My,
he
is
in
bad
shape.
Don't
you
remember
me?
This
is
Jeff.
I'll
never
forget
you
That's
the
dress
I
was
wearing
The
one
I
told
you
about,
the
one
he
tore.
We
ought
to
let
him
rest
a
while.
That
isn't
a
rattle,
is
it?
I
don't
think
so.
No.
He's
just
clearing
his
throat.
-
He
looks
awful.
-
That's
what
I
was
thinking.
Are
you
expecting
me
to
shave
him?
No.
I
can
do
it.
You?
That's
something
It's
difficult
to
shave
someone
else.
-
I've
always
shaved
him.
He's
going
to
speak.
That
barber
has
just
ruined
his
skin.
Boy.
Boy,
I
want
a
shine.
He
thinks
he's
in
the
barber
shop.
Look.
He's
lifting
his
hand.
He
thinks
he
wants
a
manicure.
What
shall
I
do?
Maybe
we
better
humor
him.
Hold
it.
You
think
we're
doing
the
right
thing?
Yes.
We
mustn't
do
anything
to
shock
him.
He
thinks
I'm
a
manicurist,
doesn't
he?
He's
squeezing
my
hand.
In
a
few
minutes,
Will
you
get
me
his
lotion
Sit
down.
A
woman
can't
control
herself
which
is
probably
why
we
love
you.
You
and
David
have
had
and
whether
you
realize
it
or
not,
and
it's
not
easily
broken.
People
get
divorced.
It's
true
that
I
think
you'll
be
better
off
My
first
wish
is
to
see
you
happy.
And
it's
possible,
it's
more
than
possible...
that
as
peculiar
as
David
is,
Tell
you
what
I'd
like
you
to
do.
Take
back
your
promise
to
marry
me,
If
you
find
you
can't
go
on
without
David...
you
know
I'll
wish
you
every
happiness
That's
very
kind
of
you.
Don't
you
think
we
ought
to
see
We'll
only
wake
him
up.
I'll
go
see
if
he's
still
asleep.
I
will
never
forget
you
Little
blue
dress!
I
should've
known
your
being
here
Look
here...
Big
sympathy
act,
-
But
I
love
you.
I
never
want
to
see
you
again.
-
Get
your
hands
off
me.
And
I
know
you're
crazy.
You're
mine
and
you
belong
to
me.
You
can't
be
with
-
That's
what
you
think.
Not
after
what
we've
been
to
each
other.
He's
going
to
lay
a
hand
on
me,
Okay.
If
that's
the
way
you
feel
about
it,
I've
been
thrown
out
of
my
own
home,
chased
around
in
taxi
cabs...
and
neglected
my
job,
because
I
loved
you
Now
I'm
finished.
It's
all
washed
up.
Go
ahead
and
marry
the
guy.
I
hope
you'll
be
very
happy.
You
heard.
He
liked
me
in
that
little
blue
dress.
-
Jeff,
will
you
marry
me?
Is
it
wise
to
make
a
decision
in
anger?
You
can
be
considerate
of
him
even
now?
-
Your
happiness
is
my
only
concern.
Why,
you're
making
me
I
know
what
you'd
like.
Some
nice
dinner.
How
about
some
nice
Hello?
Is
that
the
porter?
What's
the
first
train
10:30?
All
right.
Have
a
sleigh
up
here
It
was
a
very
nice
dinner,
wasn't
it?
I
wasn't
very
hungry.
Hope
he
has
the
decency
to
leave
tonight.
Who,
David?
He
won't
stay
around
I
bet
you
he'll
be
gone
You
know
the
real
reason
He's
still
so
much
in
love
with
me.
He's
such
an
egotist
that
he
can't
bear
-
He
doesn't
believe
I'll
marry
you.
It's
getting
colder.
Driver,
go
straight
to
Cabin
McKinley...
and
take
the
shortcut,
if
there
is
one.
-
You
know,
I'm
worried
about
him.
David,
yes.
He
may
have
been
but
he'll
really
take
to
drinking
I
don't
think
so.
David's
the
type
I'm
so
afraid
he'll
ruin
his
life
spoil
a
brilliant
future.
He
is
brilliant,
you
know.
I
mean,
if
I
could
only
disillusion
him,
If
he'd
only
hate
me,
that
would
be
Those
walls
are
paper-thin,
-
Why,
what
are
you
suggesting?
-
Hurry,
driver,
hurry.
Good
night.
It's
a
wonderful
thing
you're
doing.
He'd
be
on
my
conscience
otherwise.
Come
on
in,
Jeff.
It's
early
yet.
Put
me
down.
Put
me
down
this
instant.
Now,
Jeff...
Now,
you
know
I've
had
enough
to
drink,
Jeff,
are
you
hurt?
Don't
talk
so
loud.
Let
me
help
you
up.
My,
aren't
you
strong?
My,
what
a
heavy
shoe
it
is.
No.
What
are
you
doing?
Unless
you
stop,
Jeff,
Jeff,
behave
yourself.
You
haven't
even
got
any
pride.
I
only
did
this
for
you,
so
you'd
realize
There's
only
one
way
to
handle
you.
Let
go
of
me.
Let
go.
Jeff,
I'm
not
acting.
Hit
him,
Jeff.
-
I
don't
need
it.
-
I
forgive
you,
David.
Ann,
you're
so
attractive
less
disciplined,
Violence
shows
a
lack
of
character.
You
won't
do
anything
to
him?
Would
you
respect
me
more
Would
I?
You
big
blubber,
How
could
you
love
a
woman
Now,
let's
not
say
anything
in
anger
Haven't
you
any
self-respect?
-
Surprise.
Are
you
children
having
a
good
time?
Do
you
realize
you're
raising
your
voice?
-
Raising
her
voice?
I
never
saw
you
act
like
this
before.
Very
gentle.
How
do
you
think
I
got
this?
Jefferson,
I
forbid
you
You
forbid
him
to
marry
me?
Listen
to
me,
you
stuffed
shirt.
Even
a
mouse
has
enough
backbone
Taking
your
hat
off
on
that
elevator
You
can
teach
a
monkey
to
do
that,
whether
he's
a
dipsomaniac
over
a
lump
of
jelly
like
you.
But
I'm
not
taking
you.
Go
out
and
get
a
Girl
Guide
Let
me
out
of
here
You
have
just
seen
her
What
are
you
doing?
The
telephone
is
disconnected,
and
I'm
gonna
spend
the
evening
But
that's
ridiculous.
Not
on
your
life.
How
are
you
gonna
get
there?
If
necessary,
on
my
hands
and
knees.
You're
not
doing
me
any
favor
-
I'd
just
as
soon
you
get
out.
In
fact,
I'll
help
you
get
out.
Sorry.
Thank
you.
I'm
warning
you,
I'll
kill
you
in
cold
blood.
Sometime,
someday,
I'm
telling
you,
don't
you
try
anything.
David,
get
me
out
of
these
things.
Get
me
out
of
here!
David,
get
me
out
of
these,
