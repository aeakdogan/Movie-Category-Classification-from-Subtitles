Chems.
Greens,

Where?
Where
do
you
I
don't
know.
Dr.
Shearing,
where
are
the

I
understand,
but
I
don't
know.

It's
not
something...
So,
all
of
that
happens...
We
don't
have

If
I
had
any,
Okay,
listen
to

We

You've

I'm
asking
I
need
program

okay?
Where
do
you
keep
the
chems?
I
don't
have
any.
We
don't
have
them.
Bullshit.
I
don't
have
any!
So,
you
don't
know
anything?
That's
why
you
have
the

That's
why
they're

None
of

Look,
I

You
can't
be
that
naive.
Would
you
let

You
want
out?
Get
out.
You
don't
have
any
chems.
You
You
don't

What
are
you
going
to
