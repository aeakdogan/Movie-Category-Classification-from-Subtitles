him...
to
prevent
any
future
troubIe.
You
know
our
ruIes.
MEI:
Yes,
ma'am.

I
Ieft
you...
in
order
to
save
your
Iife.
But
you
stiII
foIIowed
me.
Please
don't
blame
me.
MEI:
If
your
pIan
succeeded...
many
in
the
FIying
Daggers
You
wouIdn't
Iet
me
go,
either.
It
wouId
be
me
on
my
knees...
waiting
to
die.
You're
right.
If
I
won...
I
wouIdn't
Iet
you
go.




Go.
How
wiII
you
expIain
this
to
Nia?
That's
my
business.
Why
don't
you
come
with
me?
Deep
in
your
heart,
I
guess...
there
is
a
man
Yes,
a
man
who's
saved
my
Iife
Was
it
he
who
heIped
us
Yes.
Then
he
has
saved
my
Iife,
too.
Do
you
stiII
Iove
him?

When
can
we
see
each
other
again?
We
cannot.
We
beIong
to
two
opposing
sides.
If
we
meet
again...
one
of
us
wiII
have
to
die.

JIN:
A
decisive
battIe
is
imminent.
JIN:
You
and
I
are
just
pawns
Nobody
cares
if
we
live
or
die.
Let's
go
away
together
as
free
as
the
wind.
We'II
wander
around
aIone.
MEI:
Come
and
go
without
a
trace,
No,
a
carefree
wind.
Just
you
and
me.
Come
with
me,
pIease.

Are
you
going
with
him?

Why?
You're
the
Iove
of
my
Iife.
You
don't
have
to
Iove
me...
but
you
can
never
go
with
him.
Otherwise
you'II
die.
Mei...
you've
forced
me
to
kiII
you.
I
knew...
you
wouId
do
this.
You
knew
and
you
went
anyway.
Why?
Why
did
you
go?
Why
did
you
go?
Why?
To
be
free...
Iike
the
wind.


Mei.
JIN:
Mei!
JIN:
Mei!

Turn....
What?
MEI:
Turn....
Turn
around?
MEI:
Look
behind
you.

You're
a
member
You're
right.
You're
the
one
who
Ioves
Mei?
Yes,
I
Iove
her
truIy...
whiIe
you
are
onIy
pIaying
a
game.
If
you
Iove
her,
why
kiII
her?
It's
aII
your
fauIt.
My
fauIt?
I
warned
you,
She
has
betrayed
me
because
of
you.
You
must
die.
Fine.
You
kiII
Mei,
you
must
die,
too.











Mei.
Let
him
go.
If
you
kiII
him...
I'II
kiII
you
with
this
dagger.
Mei!
Don't
puII
the
dagger
out!
JIN:
If
you
do,
your

You
must
not
do
it!

Mei...
I'm

He

Mei!

You

I

A

She's
the
finest
lady
on

A

A

There

that
has
been
more
cherished
than
a
beauty
like
