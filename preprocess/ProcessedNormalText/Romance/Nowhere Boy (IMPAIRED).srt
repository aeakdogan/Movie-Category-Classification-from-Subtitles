Got

Mimi,

Mimi,
it
works!
Can
we
turn
it
over,

No,
John,


We'll
slide
the
cockpit
open
-

Good
evening.

-

It
ain't
half
cold
out
here.
-

What's
that?
Hey,
hey,
come
on,
cheeky
git.
-
You'll
get
me
in
trouble.
-
What,
with
Mimi?
Don't
be
daft.
-
Ever
been
married
to
me?
Right,
now,
go
on,
you're
missing
-

What's
this
one?
-

Come
back,
where
are
you?
Uncle
George?
-
Mimi,
we
were
only
mucking
about.
There's
nothing
to
see.
-
But,
Mimi...


Mimi?
He's
dead.


Please,
let's
not
be
silly,
hmm?
If
you
want
to
do
that,
It's
just
the
two
of
us
now

God
will
show
us
In
His
presence
is
the
fullness
of
joy.
At
his
right
hand,
...brother
George.
Give
thanks
for
his
life

Fancy
Blackpool
tomorrow?
I
don't
need
looking
after,
Stan.
I
know.
I'm
just
asking
He
was
my
uncle,
too.
Yeah,
but
he
was
more
than
You
saw
her,
too,
right?
Where
is
she
now?

Do
you
want
me
to
ask
Aunt
Mimi?

John
wants
to
know
where
Aunt
Julia
is.
She
was
busy,
apparently.
You
should
call
her
Mum,
you
know.

John?
-
John,
have
you
got
your
glasses?
And
is
your
pocket
blind?
Now,
you
will
be
careful,
hmm?
It's
only
Blackpool,
Mimi.
I
found
out
where
your
mum
lives.
-
You
wanted
to
see
her,
right?
-
We
don't
have
to.
-
What
bus
do
we
get?
Are
you
coming
or
what?


Blackpool's
loss,
our
gain.
But
we
love
Blackpool,

I
knew
you
were
coming,
though.
Because
I
baked
a
cake!

What
do
you
think?
Nice,
eh?
Vanilla
buns.
-
One
for
you,
Julia.
-
One
for
you,
Jackie.
-

Ooh,
a
mouthie!
Let's
have
a
look.
Hohner.
German.
Good
at
mouthies,
though.
-
Not
so
good
at
war.
-
Do
you
mind?
Your
spit's
my
spit,
anyway.

Good
lungs
on
it.
Uncle
George
gave
it
me
He'll
be
missed.
He
was
a
good
man.
Hmm.
Come
on.

Questions?
Any

The

What
are
you?
What

Michael!
How's

Not

John.
Yourself?

No

Why?
She

through
yours.
I

her
to,

I?
Can
I

It's

Please?

You'll
set
the
house
on
fire.

I've
stolen

Nighty-night.

Mummy?

can't!
Everything
will
get
too
much
for
you
And
I
need
you.
I
need
John.
I

Very
good

very
good.
Just

At

For

You
dirty,

Now,
I
was
one
unhappy
fool
#
Well,
three
pound
ten
a
week
#
With
a
pocket
full
of
tin,
#
By
a
girl
#
Now,
the
first
time
I
saw
Maggie
#
She
took
my
breath
away
#
She
was
cruising
up
and
down
#
She
had
a
figure
so
divine
#
Her
voice
was
so
refined
#
Well,
being
a
sailor,
I
gave
chase
#
Now,
in
the
morning,
I
awoke

I
was
flat
and
stony
broke
That
was
great,
that
was
great.
Hey,
John.
John?
Paul,
a
mate
of
mine
from
school.

What,
with
himself?
I
do,
all
the
time.
-
I'm
John.
-
Want
a
beer?
-
Is
there
any
tea
left?
No,
I
didn't
think
so.
-
So,
did
you
watch
us
play?
-
And?
-

You're
alright.
-
How
alright
are
you
on
one
of
those?
You
got
that
back
to
front,
Any
requests?
That
pink
carnation
is
very
dandy.

Richard
as
well.
Nice
to
meet
you
-
Well,
I've
got
to
get
off
anyway...
Alright.
I'd
rather
him
in
our
band

John,
your
little
friend
is
here.
-

But
you
start
on
D.

Bollocks!
Hang
on
a
sec.
Keep
going.
-
It's
my
Buddy
Holly
look.
-
D.
So
from
D,
it
goes
to
E
minor.
No,
B
minor,
that's
a
banjo
chord.
-

So
B
minor,
it's...
To
G.
G.
To
A.
And
then
it
just
starts
again.
B
minor
to
G.

Blue
moon

You
saw
me
standing
alone
#
Without
a
dream
in
my
heart
#
Without
a
love
of
my
own

That's
much
better
acoustically.
Thanks.
So,
Mummy's
cool
about
baby
Paul

She
would
have
loved
it.
-
She's
not
around
any
more.
Well,
she...
You
know,
if
we're
going
to
do
this,
Then
you
don't
get
stiffed
I
write
stuff.
Not
songs,
more
poetry...
Add
a
tune
and
you've
got
a
song.
-
Have
you
written
any?
How
do
you
know
so
much?
You
don't
seem
like
You
mean
I
don't
go
round
smashing
Yeah.
No.
It's
the
music.
That's
it,
it's
just
music.
Simple.

Where
is
it?
-
Mimi,
where's
my
guitar?
You
promised
me
hard
work.
Lie
and
cheat
all
you
want
with
others.
-
Where
is
it?
-
You
can't.
-
But
we've
got
gigs.
Oh,
boo-hoo!
-
But
it's
my
group.
-
Stop
behaving
like
a
child.
-
What
did
you
say?
#
I'm
leaving
town,
baby
#
I'm
leaving
town
for
sure
#
Well,
then,
you
won't
be
bothered
#
Well,
that's
alright
#
That's
alright

That's
alright
now,

Anyway

I

So
I
got

back.

Thanks,
guys.
Next,
the
Scouse
Duane
Eddy
I
present
to
you
Mr
Paul
McCharmly.

-
Thanks,
John.
Kind
words.


Whoo!

This
is
George.
-
He
should
be
in
the
group.
-
No,
I've
been
to
bed.
Couldn't
sleep.
What?
Magic
tricks?
No,
I've
left
my
top
hat
at
home.




Abracadabra
eh,
John?


Gorgeous,
isn't
he?

I
need
to
calm
down
now.
-
That
was
brilliant.
It
was
so
good.
We
need
to
celebrate...
everything.
It's
John's
birthday
soon
so
let's
have
-
Can
we
get
boozed
up?
-
What
about
birds,
Mrs
Lennon?
What
do
you
reckon
then,
Johnny
boy?
-
I
think...
I
need
a
piss.
Who
has
got
a
light
for
a
lady?

Have
you
got
a
ticket?
If
you
don't
want
her
hanging
It's
my
fucking
band.
John,
the
driver's
not
stopping.
Thanks
for
that.
Give
us
a
ciggie.

Excuse
me.
That's
very
cosy.


My
old
man's
giving
me
no
other
choice.
Imagine
me
in
a
copper's
uniform,
Nicking
you.
I
sometimes
wish
I
had
tits,
you
know?
Not
in
a
weird
way,

Winston?

This
party.
We
don't
have

I

It
was

Taken

She

a
man
has
a
son

Like
my
son
John
-

#
When
he
talks
#
And
his
eyes
have
a
sparkle

Can
someone
turn
that
bloody
record
off
-

Cock,
balls,
fuck.
-

Is
that
allowed?

Well,
ta,
for
turning
up.

-

Thanks
for
all
this.
Well,
big
clap,
folks,

And
my
band.
What
can
I
say?
You
really
are
there
for
me.
Never
but,
nevertheless,
Speak
for
yourself,
eh,
Lennon!
-
So,
where
are
we
going,
boys?
That's
right.

-
Except
the
boy
Shotton
wants
out.
I
know.
Apparently,
washboard
players
and
he
feels
like
a
pansy
-
Come
here,
spunkhead.
Ooh!
Worth
a
few
bob
when
we're
famous.
He's
alright.
-

For
fuck's
sake!

-
Where
are
you
going?
Have
one
here.
I
wonder
if
someone's
up
there
on
Mars,
Where's
Dad?
They're
called
dads,
right?
-
I
don't
think...
Think,
think,
think.
That's
all
I
do.
Where's
Daddy,
Mummy?
-
Where's
fucking
Alf?
Make
you
feel
uncomfortable?
Try
being
me
for
17
years
when
everyone
Now,
that's
uncomfortable.
Oh,
here
we
go.
Who
turned
the
taps
on?
-
Please
don't
be
horrible
to
me,
John.
Oh,
I
see.
Horrible
John,
No,
no.
No
walking
away.
I
know
-
Where
is
he?
-
New
Zealand,
maybe.
I
don't
know.
He
was
in
the
merchant
navy.
No
letters,
no
money.
He
abandoned
us.
Then
you
abandoned
me!
It
was
a
temporary
thing.
Mimi
agreed.
Temporary?
I'm
still
living
with
her.
-
I
always
wanted
you
back.
She
never
gave
you
back.
But
surely
I'm
not
Mimi's
to
give.
You're
my
mum.
She...
She
loves
you
so
much.
Yeah,
more
than
you.

Mummy?
I'm
tired
now.
-
Are
you
sad
again?
I'm
coming
in
now,
honey.
Go
on.
I
do
love
you.
Believe
me.
Believe
me,
I
would
love
to.
-
John,
where
are
you
going?
-

You
said
you'd
be
back.
I
think
I'll
just...
It
was
meant
to
be
a
surprise.
A
Hoffner!
Mimi.
Ooh,
you
stink
of
alcohol.
Mum
threw
a
party
for
me.
Oh.
That's
a
waste,
isn't
it?


No,
thanks.
-
We've
got
a
gatecrasher.
Oh,
more
talking?
Wow!
You
see,
me
and
Mum
Yes,
she
told
me
things
about...
Oh,
and
about
you,
funnily
enough.
-
What
do
you
reckon,
Mimi?
You
said,
quote,
"She,"
as
in
you,
When
I
don't
give
things
back,
What
on
earth
have
you
Did
she
say
why
I
stole
you?
Well,
there
she
is.
Ask
her
yourself.
Did
she
mention
having
another
man's
Mimi,
please.

Please
what?
Stop?
Look
at
him.
Do
you
think
we
can
stop
now?
Whose
child?

Go
on,
tell
him,
as
you're
What
daughter?
Your
mother
has
always
needed
company.
Rock'n'roll,
eh,
Mum?
And
she
found
it,
with
a
young
soldier
You
have
another
sister.
Victoria.
Where
is
she?
Where?
We
don't
know.
Salvation
Army
took
her.


Then,
after
that,
your
mother
decides
to
shack
up
Still
married
to
your
father,
and
then
bring
you
up
as
if
that
was
When
your
father
came
home
he
wanted
to
try
and
save
the
marriage,
She
told
him
to
get
lost.
But
Alf
wasn't
giving
up
that
easily.
Hmm?
Oh,
feel
free
No,
I
didn't
think
she
would.
You
were
staying
here
with
me
when
Alf
turned
up
out
of
the
blue.
He
said
he
wanted
to
take
you
I
thought
he
was
genuine
but
he
took
you
Turned
out
he'd
organised
Got
himself
a
job
out
there.
We
hadn't
a
clue
where
you
were.
The
Seaman's
Mission
had
an
address
so
we
went
to
find
you,

Alf
wouldn't
let
me
in.
Said
He
pleaded
with
her
to
keep
the
family
together,
But
what
to
do
with
you?
So,
in
all
their
great
wisdom...
Who
do
you
want
to
be
with,
...
they
decided
to
ask
you,
who
you
wanted
to
spend
And
you
said...
My
daddy.
Daddy.

So
knowing
that
Alf
was
planning
and
knowing
she
your
mother
walked
out.
Mum!
Please!
Stop.

And
that
is
when
I
stole
you!
And
if
that's
stealing,
I'm
a
thief!
I
had
no
choice!
Oh,
you
had
a
choice.
You
chose
to
take
my
son.
Oh,
John,
You
walked
out
the
fucking
house,
Yes,
yes,
I
did,
but
I
was
ill.
-
I
get
ill.
I
don't
think
straight.
I
don't
sleep.
I've
seen
doctors
I
don't
understand.
I
am
here.
I
never
meant
to
leave
you.
Please,
John,
please.
I
love
you,
John.
-
No...
No!
I
said
no!
Can't
you
see
what
you're
doing
to
me?
I'm
going
out
of
my
brain
Is
it?
This
is
your
fault
and
yours.
So,
why
should
I
go
mad?
Fuck
it,
it's
over!
Go
home,
Julia.


Hey!
You
idiot.
No
chance.
Get
to
fuck.

Forgive
me,
angel.
Come
on,
Marie.
He's
a
loser.


-
Did
you
love
him?
-
You
frightened
me
to
death.
Did
you?
Well,
that's
a
horrible
thing
to
say.
-
You
never
showed
it.
With
my
eyesight,
possibly.
I'm
not
going
to
hold
it
against
her,
-
Forgive
and
forget,
I
suppose.
I
wish.
There's
just
no
point
I
mean,
really
love.
Is
there,
Mimi?
-
I
should
move
out.
The
house
seems
a
bit
crowded
Who
knows,
with
me
gone,
maybe
you
and
Mum
might
remember
-
Have
you
ordered?
It's
good
to
see
you.
-
Here
you
are.
You're
confusing
us
with
Buckingham
I
am
not
here
to
say
I
was
wrong,
Julia.
I
want
that
to
be
perfectly
clear.
But...
Perhaps
I
haven't
always
been
right.
I
do
love
you.
I
hope
you
know
that.

Do
you
own
a
licence
It's
a
nice
day
for
it,
then.
Everything
feels
so
different
Yes,
usually
warmer.
How
was
college?
A
woman
came
in,
took
her
kit
off

Not
actually
physically.
I've
got
my
eye
on
you
two.

Where
are
you
going?

Paul's
waiting
for
me
at
his.
-
What
about
dinner?
-
Well,
you
will
be.
Just
with
him
being
near,

mean,

you're
not
making

me
from
cooking,
