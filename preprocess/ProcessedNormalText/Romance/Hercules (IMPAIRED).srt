NARRATOR:
Long
ago,
there
was
a
golden
age
of
powerful
And
the
greatest
and
strongest
of
all
But
what
is
the
measure
of
a
true
hero?
-
That
is
what
our
story
is...
He's
makin'
the
story
sound
like
-
Lighten
up,
dude.
NARRATOR:
You
go,
girl.
We
are
the
Muses,
goddesses
of
Heroes
like
Hercules.
Honey,
you
mean
"Hunk-ules."
Ooh,
I'd
like
to
make
Our
story
actually
begins
long
before
Ah
Back
when
the
world
was
new
The
planet
Earth
was
down
on
its
luck
And
everywhere
gigantic
brutes
It
was
a
nasty
place
There
was
a
mess
Where
chaos
reigned
and
the
Say
it,
girlfriend!
And
then
along
came
Zeus
-
He
hurled
his
thunderbolt
-
Locked
those
suckers
in
a
vault
And
on
his
own
And
that's
the
gospel
truth
The
guy
was
too
"Type
A"
to
just
relax
And
that's
the
world's
first
dish
Yeah,
baby.
Zeus
tamed
the
globe
Though,
honey
it
may
seem
impossible
That's
the
gospel
truth
On
Mount
Olympus
life
was
neat
Although,
honey
That's
the
gospel
truth
CHORUS:
Ah,
ah
-
Yeah,
yeah
Hey,
hey,
hey
Ah,
ah
Hey,
yeah



Hercules!

Behave
yourself.

Look
at
this.
Look
how
cute
he
is.
-

Hah!
Oh,
he's
strong
like
his
dad,
hmm?
Whoa!
Excuse
me!
Hot
stuff
coming
Why,
Hermes,
they're
lovely.
Yeah,
you
know,
Isn't
that
too
nutty?
Fabulous
party.
You
know,
I
haven't
seen
this
much
love
in
a
room

Dear,
keep
those
away
from
the
baby.
He
won't
hurt
himself.
Let
the
kid
have
a
little
fun.

On
behalf
of
my
son,
I
want
to
thank
you
all
What
about
our
gift,
dear?
Well,
let's
see
here.
We'll
take...
A
little
cirrus
and
a
dash
of
cumulus.


His
name
is
Pegasus,
and
he's
all
yours,
son.


Mind
his
head.
He's
so
tiny.

My
boy.
My
little
Hercules.
MAN:
How
sentimental.
You
know,
since
I
got
a
hunk
of
moussaka
So
is
this
an
audience
or
a
mosaic?
Hey,
how
you
doin'?
So,
Hades,
you
finally
made
it.
Well,
they're
just
fine.
And,
as
always,
What
are
you
gonna
do?
There's
the
little
sunspot.
And
here
is
a
sucker
Here
you
go.
Ya
just...

-
Sheesh.
Uh,
powerful
little
tyke.
Come
on,
Hades.
Don't
be
such
a
stiff.
Hey.
Love
to,
babe,
but
unlike
you
gods
I
regrettably
have
a
full-time
gig
that
you,
by
the
way,
So,
can't.
Love
to,
but
can't.
You
ought
to
slow
down.
Hah!
Work
yourself
to
death!

Oh,
I
kill
myself!

If
only.
If
only.
If
there's
one
god
you
don't
want
to
'Cause
he
had
an
evil
plan.
He
ran
the
underworld
But
thought
the
dead
He
was
as
mean
as
he
was
ruthless
-
And
that's
the
gospel
truth
He
had
a
plan
to
shake
things
up
And
that's
the
gospel
truth
Pain!
Coming,
your
most
lugubriousness.
Ow!


Panic!
I'm
sorry.
I
can
handle
it!

-
Pain!
Ohh!
-
Reporting
for
duty!
Fine,
fine,
fine.
Just
let
me
know
Oh.
They're
here.
What?
The
Fates
are
here,

-
We
are
worms!
Worthless
worms!
Memo
to
me,
memo
to
me.
Darling,
hold
that
mortal's
thread
of
life
good
and
tight.

Incoming!

Ladies!
Hah!
I
am
so
sorry
that
I'm...
-
Late!
-
We
knew
you
would
be.
-
Past.
And
Future.
Indoor
plumbing,
it's
gonna
be
big.
Great,
great.
Anyway,
see,
ladies,
-

We
know!
So
here's
the
deal.
Zeus,
Mr.
High
and
Mighty,
Mr.
"Hey,
you,
-

A
bouncing
baby
brat.
I
know
you
know.
I
know.
So
let
me
just
ask.
Is
this
kid
gonna
mess
up
What
do
you
think?
No,
you
don't.

Oh,
wait.
I'm
sorry.
Time
out.
Can
I...
Can
I
ask
you
a
question,
by
the
way?
Did
you
cut
your
hair
or
something?
I
mean,
you
look
like
-

Oh,
gross!
Ladies,
please.
My
fate
is
in
your
lovely
hands.
-
Oh,
yeah!
In
18
years
precisely,
the
planets
will
align
ever
so
nicely.
Ay,
verse.
Oy.
The
time
to
act
will
be
at
hand.
Unleash
the
Titans,
Mm-hmm.
Good,
good.
Then
the
once-proud
Zeus
and
you,
Hades,
will
rule
all!
Yes!
Hades
rules!
A
word
of
caution
to
this
tale.
Excuse
me?
Should
Hercules
fight,
you
will
fail.

What?
Okay,
fine,
fine.
I'm
cool.
I'm
fine.

Pain?
Panic?
Got
a
little
riddle
for
ya.
How
do
you
kill
a
god?
-
I
do
not
know!
Bingo!
They're
immortal.
So,
first
you
got
to
turn



-
What?
What
is
it?
-
The
baby!
-

Hercules!
Oh!

No!
Now
we
did
it!
Zeus
is
gonna
use
us
Just
hang
onto
the
kid,
Panic.
-

Hurry!
Let's
just
kill
the
kid
Here
you
go,
kid.
Look
at
that!
He's
changing.
No,
he
has
to
drink
the
whole
potion.
MAN:
Who's
there?

-
Alcmene,
over
here.

You
poor
thing.
-
Oh,
don't
cry.
-
Now?

Oh.
Well,
Amphitryon,
for
so
many
years
we've
prayed
to
the
gods
-
Perhaps
they've
answered
our
prayers.
"Hercules"?






Help,
help,
help!
Hades
is
gonna
kill
us
You
mean,
if
he
finds
out.
Of
course
he's
gonna...
If.
If
is
good.
MUSE:
It
was
tragic.
Zeus
led
all
the
gods
But
by
the
time
they
found
the
baby,
Young
Herc
was
mortal
now
But
since
he
did
not
drink
the
last
drop
He
still
retained
his
godlike
strength
So
thank
his
lucky
stars
Tell
it,
girl.
But
Zeus
and
Hera
wept
Because
their
son
They'd
have
to
watch
their
precious
Though
Hades'
horrid
plan
Was
hatched
before
The
boy
grew
stronger
every
day
And
that's
the
gospel
truth
The
gospel
truth
-


Hercules,
slow
down!
Look
out!

Sorry,
guys.
-
Hey,
watch
where
you're
goin'.

Thanks,
son.
When
old
Penelope
twisted
her
ankle
No
problem,
Pop.
Uh,
don't
unload
just
yet.
Okay.
-

Sorry,
Penelope.
Now,
Hercules,
this
time,
please
just...
I
know.
I
know.
-
Stay
by
the
cart.
That's
my
boy.
-

Oh,
my
goodness.
Whoa!
-
Careful!
-
Why,
thank
you.
Why,
Hercules!

It's
you!
-
Let
me
help
you
with
that.

I'm
fine.
-
Are
you
sure?
Absolutely.
Yo!
Give
it
here!

Hey,
you
need
an
extra
guy?
Uh...
Sorry,
Herc.
Uh,
we
already
got
five,
Hey,
wait
a
second.
Five
isn't
an
even...
-
See
ya,
Herc.
-
Destructo
Boy.

BOY:
Heads
up!
I
got
it!
No!
Stop!
-

-

It's
okay.

Hey!
Whoa!

-
Son!
Oh,
my!
No!
Don't!
No,
no,
no,
no!
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no!


-
Watch
out!


Nice
catch,
Jerkules.
-
Son...
This
is
the
last
straw,
Amphitryon!
That
boy
is
a
menace!
He's
too
dangerous

He
didn't
mean
any
harm.
He
just
can't
control
his
strength.
I'm
warning
you.
You
keep
that
freak
away
from
here!
-
BOY:
Freak!
Yeah,
go
away!

Son,
you
shouldn't
let
those
But,
Pop,
they're
right.
I
am
a
freak.

I
just
can't.
Sometimes
I
feel
like
like
I'm
supposed
to
be
someplace
else.
Hercules,
son...
I
know
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
I
have
often
dreamed
of
a
far
off
place
Where
a
great,
warm
welcome
Where
the
crowds
will
cheer
And
a
voice
keeps
sayin'
I
will
find
my
way
I
can
go
the
distance
I'll
be
there
someday
If
I
can
be
strong
I
know
every
mile
Will
be
worth
my
while
I
would
go
most
anywhere
to
feel
like
I
Belong
Hercules,
there's
something
your
mother
and
I
But
if
you
found
me,
Why
was
I
left
here?
This
was
around
your
neck
It's
the
symbol
of
the
gods.
This
is
it!
Don't
you
see?
I'll
go
to
the
temple
of
Zeus
and...
Ma,
Pop,
you're
the
greatest
parents
I
gotta
know.

I
am
on
my
way
I
can
go
the
distance
I
don't
care
how
far
Somehow,
I'll
be
strong
I
know
every
mile
Will
be
worth
my
while
I
would
go
most
anywhere
To
find
where
I
belong
Oh,
mighty
Zeus,
please,
hear
me
and
answer
my
prayer.
I
need
to
know.
Who
am
I?
Where
do
I
belong?

Huh?

My
boy.
My
little
Hercules.
-

-

What's
your
hurry?
After
all
these
years,
is
this
the
kind
of
Father?
Didn't
know
you
had
a
famous
father,
-
Surprise!
Look
how
you've
grown.
Why,
you've
got
your
mother's
I
don't
understand.
If
you're
my
father,
-
A
god.
A
god!
Hey,
you
wanted
answers,
and
by
thunder,
you're
old
enough
But
why
did
you
leave
me
on
Earth?
Of
course
we
did.
Your
mother
and
I
Someone
stole
you
from
us
and
only
gods
And
you
can't
do
a
thing?
I
can't,
Hercules,
but
you
can.
Really?
What?
I'll
do
anything.
Hercules,
if
you
can
prove
yourself
your
godhood
will
be
restored!
A
true
hero.
Great!
Exactly
how
do
you
First,
you
must
seek
out
Philoctetes,
Seek
out
Philoctetes.
Whoa!
Hold
your
horses!
Which
reminds
me.


ZEUS:
Ha!
You
probably
don't
remember
Pegasus,



Oh,
Pegasus!
He's
a
magnificent
horse

Huh?
I'll
find
Philoctetes
That's
the
spirit!
I
won't
let
you
down,
Father!
Yee-haw!
Good
luck,
son.
I
will
beat
the
odds
I
can
go
the
distance
I
will
face
the
world
Fearless,
proud
and
strong
I
will
please
the
gods
I
can
go
the
distance
Till
I
find
my
hero's
welcome
Belong

-

You
sure
this
is
the
right
place?




What's
the
matter,
little
guy?
Hey,
butt
out,
buddy!
-
Ugh!
Girls!
Stop!
Stop!
Whoa,
whoa!
Oh.
Geez!
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Oh,
Nymphs!
-
They
can't
keep
their
hands
off
me.

What's
the
matter?
Uh,
no.
Can
you
help
us?
We're
looking
for
someone
Call
me
Phil.
-
Phil!
Boy,
am
I
glad
to
meet
you!
-

Animals!
Disgusting!
-

I
want
to
become
a
hero,
a
true
hero.
-
Sorry,
kid.
Can't
help
ya.
Uh,
sorry.
-
Why
not?
Look,
I
gotta
do
this.
Haven't
you
ever
had
a
dream,
something
you
wanted
so
bad

Kid,
come
inside.

Watch
it!
-
The
Argo?
Who
do
you
think
Cleopatra?
I
trained
all
those
would-be
heroes.
Odysseus,
Perseus,
Theseus.
And
every
single
one
of
those
bums
None
of
'em
could
go
the
distance.
And
then
there
was
Achilles.
Now,
there
was
a
guy
who
had
it
all,
He
could
jab,
he
could
take
a
hit,
But
that
furshlugginer
heel
of
his!
He
barely
gets
nicked
there
once
He's
history.

Yeah,
I
had
a
dream
once.
I
dreamed
I
was
gonna
train
So
great,
the
gods
would
hang
a
picture
and
people
would
say,
That's
right.
Eh,
but
dreams
are
for
rookies.
A
guy
can
only
take
But
I'm
different
than
I
can
go
the
distance.

-

Watch
this.

Holy
Hera.

You
know,
maybe
if
I...
I'm
too
old
But
if
I
don't
become
a
true
hero,
I'll
Hold
it!
Zeus
is
your
father,
right?
-
Uh-huh.
Zeus.
The
big
guy.
He's
your
daddy.
Mr.
Lightning
Bolts!
Read
me
a
book,
would
ya,
Da-da?
Zeus!
It's
the
truth!
Please!
So
you
wanna
be
a
hero,
kid
Well,
whoop-de-do
I
have
been
around
the
block
before
With
blockheads
just
like
you
Each
and
every
one
a
disappointment
Pain
for
which
there
ain't
no
ointment
So
much
for
excuses
Askin'
me
to
jump
into
the
fray
My
answer
is
two
words
Okay.
-
You
mean
you'll
do
it?
-
You
won't
be
sorry,
Phil.
So
when
do
we
start?
Oy
vey.
I'd
given
up
hope
A
fella
who'd
ring
the
bell
for
once
The
kind
who
wins
trophies
Won't
settle
for
low
fees
At
least
semipro
fees
But,
no,
I
get
the
greenhorn
I've
been
out
to
pasture,
pal
Content
to
spend
lazy
days
But
you
need
an
advisor
A
satyr,
but
wiser
A
good
merchandiser
and...
Whoa
There
goes
my
ulcer
I'm
down
to
one
last
hope
Though,
kid,
you're
not
exactly
I
trained
enough
turkeys
You're
my
one
last
hope
Rule
number
six.
When
rescuing
a
damsel...
...always
handle
with
care.

No!
Rule
number
95,
kid.
Concentrate!
Rule
number
96.
Aim!
Demigods
have
faced
the
odds
Don't
believe
the
stories
To
be
a
true
hero,
kid,
is
a
dying
art
Like
paintin'
a
masterpiece
It's
a
work
of
heart
It
takes
more
than
sinew
Comes
down
to
what's
in
you
You
have
to
continue
to
grow
Now,
that's
more
like
it!
I'm
down
to
one
last
shot
Before
that
blasted
underworld
My
dreams
are
on
you,
kid
Go
make
'em
come
true
Climb
that
uphill
slope
Keep
pushin'
that
envelope
You're
my
one
last
hope
And,
kid,
it's
up
to
you
Yeah!

Did
you
see
that?
Next
stop,
Olympus.
All
right,
just
take
it
easy,
champ.
I
am
ready.
I
want
to
get
off
this
island.
I
want
to
see
battles
and
monsters.
-
Rescue
some
damsels.
You
know,
heroic
stuff.
-
Well...
Well,
okay.
Okay,
you
want
a
road
test?
We're
going
to
Thebes!
-
HERCULES:
So
what's
in
Thebes?
It's
a
big,
tough
town.
-

Sounds
like
your
basic
DID,
-

Not
so
fast,
sweetheart.
I
swear,
Nessus.
Put
me
down
or
I'll...
Whoo!
I
like
'em
fiery!
-

First,
analyse
the
situation.
Don't
just
barrel
in
there
-

-
You
don't
know
what
you're...
Step
aside,
two
legs.
Pardon
me,
my
good
sir.
I'll
have
to
ask
you
to
-
Keep
movin',
junior.
But
you...
I'm
a
damsel,
I'm
in
distress.
I
can
handle
this.
Have
a
nice
day.
Uh.

Ma'am,
I'm
afraid
you
may
be
Ohhh!
-
What
are
you
doin'?
Get
your
sword!
Rule
number
15,



Whoa!
Hold
it!
Hold
on!
Come
on,
kid!
Concentrate!
-
Use
your
head!
Oh.

All
right!
Not
bad,
kid!
Not
exactly
what
I
had
in
mind,

Oh,
gee,
miss,
I'm
really
sorry.
-
Yeah.
Excuse
me.
Nice
work!
Excelente!
Is
Wonderboy
here
for
real?
What
are
you
talkin'
about?
Whoa!
And
by
the
way,
sweet
cheeks,
-

Yee-hah!
Yahoo!
Whoa!


-
How
was
that,
Phil?
You
can
get
away
with
mistakes
but
this
is
the
big
leagues!
At
least
I
beat
him,
didn't
I?
Next
time,
don't
let
your
guard
down
It's
like
I
keep
tellin'
ya.

-

Are
you
all
right,
Miss...
Megara.
My
friends
call
me
Meg.
So
did
they
give
you
a
name


Are
you
always
this
articulate?
Hercules.
My...

Hercules.
I
think
I
prefer
Wonderboy.
So,
how'd
you
get
mixed
up
with
the...
Pinhead
with
hooves?
They
think
that
"No"
means
"Yes,
"
and

Don't
worry.

Well,
thanks
for
everything,
Herc.
Wait!
Can
we
give
you
a
ride?

I
don't
think
Pegasus?
Oh,
no.
Don't
be
silly.

I'll
be
all
right.
I'm
a
big,
tough
girl.
Bye-bye,
Wonderboy.
Bye.
-
She's
something.
Isn't
she,
Phil?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's
really
something.
A
real
pain
in
the
patella!
Earth
to
Herc!
We
got
a
job
to
do,
remember?
Thebes
is
still
waitin'.
HERCULES:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I
know.


Aw...
How
cute.
A
couple
of
rodents
Who
you
callin'
a
rodent,
sister?
And
I'm
his
gopher.

Ta-da!
I
thought
I
smelled
a
rat.
HADES:
Meg?
Speak
of
the
devil.
Meg,
my
little
flower,
my
little
bird,
What
exactly
happened
here?
I
thought
you
were
gonna
to
join
my
team
for
the
uprising,
and
here
I
am,
I
gave
it
my
best
shot,
Fine.
So,
instead
of
subtracting
hey,
I'm
gonna
add
two
on,
okay?
Give
that
your
best
shot.
It
wasn't
my
fault.
Hercules?
I
don't
know.
-
What
was
that
name
again?
He
comes
on
with
but
I
could
see
through
that
Wait
a
minute.
Wasn't
Hercules
the
name
-
Oh,
my
gods!
-
Run
for
it!
So
you
took
care
of
him,
huh?
Dead
as
a
door
nail.
Weren't
those
your
exact
words?
This
might
be
a
different
Hercules.
Yeah!
I
mean,
Hercules
Remember,
like,
a
few
years
ago,
and
the
girls
were
all
named
Brittany?
I'm
about
to
rearrange
the
cosmos,
and
the
one
schlemiel
who
can
louse

Wait.
Wait,
big
guy.
-
We
can
still
cut
in
on
his
waltzing.
And
at
least
we
made
him
mortal.
Didn't
we?
Hmm.
Fortunately
for
the
three
of
you,
we
still
have
time
to
correct
And
this
time,
no
foul-ups.
Wow!
-
Is
that
all
one
town?
The
one
and
only
Thebes.
If
you
can
make
it
there,



Stick
with
me,
kid.
-
Look
where
you're
goin',
numbskull!
You
see
what
I
mean?
MAN:
Pitta
bread.
Pitta
bread.
Hey,
Mack.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
-
You
wanna
buy
a
sundial?
Come
on,
kid.
The
end
is
coming!
Can't
you
feel
it?
Yes,
yes.
Thank
you
for
the
info.
Yes.
Just
stare
at
the
sidewalk.
Come
on.
Don't
make
eye
contact.
That's
because
Trust
me,
kid.
You're
gonna
be
It
was
tragic!
Everything
except
old
Snowball
here.

Now,
were
the
fires
They
were
after
the
earthquake.
But
before
the
flood.
Don't
even
get
me
started
Thebes
has
certainly
OLD
MAN:
Tell
me
about
it.
It
seems
like
every
time
I
turn
around,
there's
some
new
monster
All
we
need
now
is
a
plague
of
locusts.
-

That's
it!
I'm
movin'
to
Sparta!
HERCULES:
Excuse
me.
It,
uh...

...seems
to
me
that
what
Yeah,
and
who
are
you?
I'm
Hercules,
and
I
happen
to
be
a
hero.

-
Is
that
so?
-
Have
you
ever
saved
a
town
before?
Have
you
ever
Well,
uh,
no.
Listen
to
this.
-
This
we
need.
-
Don't
you
pea
brains
get
it?
This
kid
is
the
genuine
article.
Hey,
isn't
that
the
goat-man
Watch
it,
pal.
Yeah,
you're
right.
Hey,
nice
job
on
those
heels!
Ya
missed
a
spot!

I
got
your
heel
right
here!
I'll
wipe
that
stupid
grin
Hey,
Phil!
Phil!
Phil!
Take
it
easy.
Phil.
What
are
you,
crazy?
Sheesh!
Young
man,
we
need
Well,
wait.
Stop!

How

I
supposed
to
prove
myself
You'll
get
your
chance.
You
just

some
kind
of

Please.
Help!
Please!
-
Meg?
Wonderboy!
Hercules!
What's
wrong?
Outside
of
town,
two
little
boys.
There
was
this
terrible
rockslide.
-
They're
trapped!
Phil,
this
is
great!
You're
really
choked
up
about
this,
Come
on!
No,
I...
You
don't...

-

I'm
right
behind
ya,
kid!
Whoo!
I'm

behind
ya,
kid.

I

wedgie.

Are
you
okay?
Just
get

BOY
1:
Help!
I
can't
breathe!
-
Get
us
out!
Somebody
call
IX-I-I!

Easy,
fellas.
You'll
be
all
right.
-
We
can't
last
much
longer!


-
How
you
boys
doin'?
Jeepers,
mister.
You're
really
strong.
Well,
try
to
be
a
little
more
careful
We
sure
will.
HADES:
A
stirring
performance,
boys.
I
was
really
moved.

"Jeepers,
mister"?
I
was
going
for
innocence.
And,
hey,
two
thumbs
What
a
dish.
What
a
doll.
Get
outta
there,
you
big
lug,

Phil,
I
did
great.
They
even
applauded,
sort
of.
-

I
hate
to
burst
your
bubble,
kid,

Phil?
What
do
you
call
that
thing?
PHIL:
Two
words.

Am-scray!
-


Let's
get
ready
to
rumble!
That's
it.
Dance
around!
Dance
around!
Watch
the
teeth.
Watch
the
teeth.
Lead
with
your
left.


Whoa!

-


-




All
right!
All
right!
You're
bad!
Okay!
See,
Phil?
That...
That
wasn't
so
hard.
Kid,
kid,
kid.
How
many
horns
do
ya
see?
Six?
Eh,
close
enough.


Guys,
guys,
relax.
It's
only
half-time.

That
doesn't
sound
good.

Definitely
not
good!



Whoa!
Whoa!
Will
you
forget
the
head-slicing
thing?
Hyah!

Phil,
I
don't
think
we
covered


My
favourite
part
of
the
game,
-

sudden
death.

ALL:
Huh?

Oh!
There
goes
another
one.
Game.
Set.
Match.

Phil,
you
gotta
admit.
Ya
did
it,
kid!
Ya
did
it!

Hades

Well,

From
that
day
forward,
He

cool.
Oh,

Point

Here
was
a
kid
with
his
act
down
pat
Zero
to
hero
in
no
time
flat
-
Zero
to
hero
When
he
smiled
the
girls
went
wild
With
oohs
and
aahs
And
they
slapped
his
face
On
every
"vahse"
From
appearance
fees
and
royalties
Our
Herc
had
cash
to
burn
Now
nouveau
riche
and
famous
He
could
tell
you
what's
a
Grecian
urn
Say
amen,
there
he
goes

-
Sweet
and
undefeated
Folks
lined
up
just
to
watch
him
flex
And
this
perfect
package
Hercie,

comes
Honey,
the
crowds
were
goin'
bonkers
He
showed
the
moxie
Yeah

From

Who

Hercules
Who's

Hercules
My

Hercules,
Hercules
Bless
my
soul,
Herc
was
on
a
roll

Undefeated
And
the
nicest
guy.
Not
conceited

He
was
a
nothing

Now
he's
a
honcho
He

the
heights
at
breakneck
speed
-
From

to
hero
Herc
is
a
hero
Now
he's
a
hero
Yes,
indeed

Pull!
Nice
shootin',
Rex.
I
can't
believe
this
guy.
I
throw
everything
I've
got
at
him

What
are
those?
Um,
I
don't
know.
I've
got
24
hours
to
get
rid
of
this
bozo,
or
the
entire
scheme
I've
been
setting
and
you
are
wearing
his
merchandise!


Thirsty?



Looks
like
your
game's
over.
Wonderboy
is
hitting
Oh,
yeah.

I
wonder
if
maybe
I
haven't
been
throwing
Don't
even
go
there.
See,
he's
gotta
have
a
weakness
I
mean,
for
what?
For
the
Trojans,
hey.
We
simply
need
to
I've
done
my
part.
Get
your
little
imps...
They
couldn't
handle
him
as
a
baby.
I
need
somebody
Hey,
I've
sworn
off
manhandling.
That's
good
because
that's
what
You
sold
your
soul
to
me
And
how
does
this
creep
thank
you?
By
running
off
with
some
babe.
He
hurt
you
real
bad,
Look,
I
learned
my
lesson,
okay?
Which
is
exactly
why
I
got
a
feelin'
You
give
me
the
key
and
I
give
you
the
thing
that
your
freedom.


You
should
have
been
there,
Father.
I
mangled
the
Minotaur,
Just
like
Phil
told
me.
I
analysed
the
situation,
The
crowds
went
wild!
-

Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Hah!
You're
doin'
great,
son.
I'm
glad
to
hear
you
say
that,
Father.
I've
been
waiting
for
this
day
Hmm.
What
day
is
that,
son?
The
day
I
rejoin
the
gods.
You've
done
wonderfully.
You're
just
not
there
yet.
You
haven't
proven
yourself
a
true
hero.
But,
Father,
I've
beaten
every
single
I'm
the
most
famous
person
-
I'm
an
action
figure!
I'm
afraid
being
famous
What
more
can
I
do?
It's
something
-
But
how
can
I...
Father,
wait!

-

On
your
left
is
Hercules'
villa.
Our
next
stop
is
where
you
can
pick
up
the
great
hero's
30-minute
At
1:00,
He's
got
a
problem
with
his
stables.
I'd
advise
you
-
Phil?
PHIL:
DGR,
the
Daughters
of
-
Phil.
you
gotta
get
a
girdle
Phil,
what's
the
point?

That's
it!
Keep
your
toga
on,
pal.

Yuck!
What
d'you
mean,
"What's
the
point?"
You
wanna
go
to
Olympus,
don't
ya?
Yeah,
but
this
stuff
doesn't
seem
You
can't
give
up
now.
I
gave
this
everything
I
had.
Listen
to
me,
kid.
I
seen
'em
all.
And
I
am
tellin'
you,
-
you
got
somethin'
I
never
seen
before.
I
can
feel
it
right
down
There
is
nothin'
you
can't
do,
kid.
-

It's
him!
Hey,
watch
it!
Watch
it!
Watch...
-
I
touched
his
elbow!
-

-
Okay.
Escape
plan,
beta.
-

There
he
goes!
On
the
veranda!
-


Let's
see.
What
could
be
behind
Meg!

It's
all
right.
Gee,
it's
great
to
see
you.
I
missed
you.
So
this
is
what
heroes
do

I'm
no
hero.
Sure
ya
are.
Everybody
in
Greece
thinks
you're
the
greatest
thing

I
know.
It's
crazy.
You
know,
I
can't
go
anywhere
-
I
mean...
-
Think
your
nanny
goat
would
go...
...berserk
if
you
played
hooky
Oh,
gee.
I
don't
know.
Phil's
got
the
rest
of
the
day
Ah,
Phil,
schmill.
Just
follow
me.
Out
the
window,
round
the
dumbbells,


HERCULES:
Wow.
What
a
day.
First,
that
restaurant
by
the
bay,
Man!
I
thought
I
had
problems.
-

-
Psst!
Stop
foolin'
around!
I
didn't
know
that
-
Yeah.
Neither
did
I.
Oh.

Don't
thank
me
just
yet.
Oh!
Oop.
Careful.
Sorry.
Weak
ankles.
Oh,
yeah?
Well,
So,
uh,
do
you
have
any
problems
Uh...
Weak
ankles,
I
mean.
Oh,
no.
Not
really.
No
weaknesses
whatsoever?
No
trick
knee?
Ruptured
disks?

No.
I'm
afraid
I'm,
uh,
fit
as
a
fiddle.

Wonderboy,
you
are
perfect.

Thanks.
-

It
looks
better
that
way.
No,
it
really
does.

You
know,
when
I
was
a
kid,
I
would
have
given
anything

You
wanted
to
be
Everybody's
not
like
that.
Yes,
they
are.
You're
not
like
that.
How
do
you
know
what
I'm
like?
All
I
know
is
you're
the
most
amazing

Oh!
Meg,
when
I'm
with
you,
Sometimes
it's
better
to
be
alone.
What
do
you
mean?
Nobody
can
hurt
you.
Meg?
I
would
never,
ever
hurt
you.
And
I
don't
wanna
hurt
you,
so
let's
both
before
we...
PHIL:
All
right!
Break
it
up!
Break
it
up!
-
I
been
lookin'
all
over
this
town!
It
was
all
my
fault.
You're
already
on
my
list,
sister,
-

And
as
for
you,
ya
bum,
and
you're
gonna
be
put
through
-
Now
get
on
the
horse.
-
I'm
sorry.
PHIL:
Move!
-

Hey,
watch
it,
watch
it!
Watch
it!
That's
it.
Next
time,
I
drive.
Oh,
what's
the
matter
with
me?
You'd
think
a
girl
would
learn.
If
there's
a
prize
for
rotten
judgment
I
guess
I've
already
won
that
No
man
is
worth
the
aggravation
That's
ancient
history
Who
d'ya
think
you're
kidding
Try
to
keep
it
hidden
-
Oh,
no
We
know
how
you
feel
No
chance,
no
way
You
swoon,
you
sigh
It's
too
cliché,
I
won't
say
I'm
in
love
Shoo-doo,
shoo-doo
I
thought
my
heart
It
feels
so
good
when
you
start
out
My
head
is
screaming
Unless
you're
dyin'
You
keep
on
denying
Baby,
we're
not
buyin'
Face
it
like
a
grown-up
-
Got
Oh,
no
chance,
no
way
-
Give
up,
but
give
in
This
scene
won't
play
You're
doing
flips
You're
in
love
You're
way
off
base
She
won't
say
in
love
Get
off
my
case,
I
won't
say
it
Girl,
don't
be
proud
Oh
At
least
out
loud
I
won't
say
I'm
in
-
Love
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ah
Hey,
what's
the
buzz,
huh,
Meg?
What
is
the
weak
link
Get
yourself
another
girl.
I'm
through.
I'm
sorry.
Do
you
mind
I
must
have
had
a
chunk
of
brimstone
Then
read
my
lips!
Forget
it.
Meg,
Meg,
Meg,
Aren't
we
forgetting
one
teensy-weensy,
I
own
you!

-
I
got
another
horn
here.
That
kid's
gonna
be
HADES:
If
I
say,
"Sing,
"
you
say,
If
I
say,
"I
want
Wonderboy's
head
Medium
or
well-done.
Oh!
I
knew
that
dame
was
trouble.
-
MEG:
I'll
work
on
that.
That's
the
sound
of
your
freedom

I
don't
care.
I
can't
believe
you're
This
one
is
different.
Please!
-
He
would
never
do
anything
to
hurt
me.
Besides,
O
oneness,
He
has
no
weaknesses.
He's
gonna...
I
think
he
does,
Meg.
I
truly
think
he
does.

Ha
ha!
-

Whoo-hoo!
Hey,
Phil!
What
happened
to
you?
Kid,
we
gotta
talk.
Phil,
I
just
had
I
can't
stop
thinking
about
Meg.

She's
something
else.
Kid,
I'm
tryin'
to
talk
to
ya!
Aw,
how
can
I
come
down
there


Gotcha!
Ah,
very
nice!
What
I'm
tryin'
to
say
is...
That
if
it
wasn't
for
you,
Oh,
I
owe
ya
big
time.
Will
you
just
knock
it
off
Rule
number
38.
Come
on,
Phil.
-
Phil,
I
got
two
words
for
ya,
duck!
-
A
dream
come
true?
-
More
beautiful
than
Aphrodite?
-
The
most
wonderful...
She's
been
playin'
ya
for
a
sap!
-
Aw,
come
on.
Stop
kiddin'
around.
I
know
you're
upset
about
today,
Kid,
you're
missin'
the
point.
-
The
point
is,
I
love
her.
-
You're
crazy.
-
Stop
it!
Shut
up!
Phil.
I...
I'm
sorry.
Okay,
okay,
that's
it.
Phil,
wait.
Where
you
going?
I'm
hoppin'
the
first
barge
out
of
here.
Fine!
Go!
I
don't...
I
don't
need
you.
I
thought
you
were
gonna
be
not
the
all-time
chump.
HADES:
Geez
Louise!
Baboom.
Name
is
Hades,
-
Hi.
How
ya
doin'?
Hey,
hey.
I
only
need
a
few
seconds
I've
got
the
major
deal
in
the
works.
And
Herc,
you
little
devil
you.
You
seem
to
be
constantly
You've
got
the
wrong
guy.
Hear
me
out,
ya
little...
So
I
would
be
eternally
grateful
if
you
would
just
take
a
day
off
I
mean,
monsters,
natural
disasters.
-
You're
out
of
your
mind.
I
do
have
a
little
leverage
-
Meg!
-
Let
her
go!
You
give
up
your
strength
Say
the
next
24
hours.
And
Meg
here
is
free
as
a
bird
We
dance,
we
kiss,
we
schmooze,
What
d'ya
say?
Come
on.
People
are
gonna
get
hurt,
aren't
they?
Nah!
I
mean,
it's
a
possibility.
But
what
can
I
tell
ya?
Anyway,
Isn't
Meg,
little
smoochy
face,
-
Stop
it!
You've
gotta
swear
Fine,
okay.
I'll
give
you
that
one.
Meg
is
safe,
otherwise
you
get
your
Fine
print.
Boilerplate.
Okay?
Done.
Hey,
I
really
don't
have,
like,
I'm
kind
of
on
a
schedule
here.
I
need
an
answer,
like,
now.
-
All
right!

You
may
feel
just
a
little
queasy.
Maybe
you
should
sit
down!

Now
you
know
how
it
feels
Isn't
it
just
peachy?
Oh!

Meg,
babe,
a
deal's
a
deal.
And
by
the
way,
Herc,
-
Stop
it.
I
mean
your
little
chickie-poo
here
Duh.
You're...
You're
lying!
-
Help!

Couldn't
have
done
it
without
you,
No!
It's
not
like
that.
I
didn't
mean
to...
I
couldn't...
I...
I'm
so
sorry.
Our
hero's
a
zero!
Our
hero's
a
zero!

Well,
gotta
blaze.
There's
a
whole
cosmos
up
there

So
much
for
the
preliminaries,

Brothers!
Titans!
Look
at
you
in
your
squalid
prison!
Who
put
you
down
there?
TITANS:
Zeus!
And
now
that
I
set
you
free,
what
is
-
TITANS:
Destroy
him!
Crush
Zeus!
Freeze
him!
Melt
Zeus!
Blow
him
away!

ALL:
Zeus!
-
HADES:
Uh,
guys?
Olympus
would
be
that
way.
-
Zeus!
Hold
it,
bright
eye.
I
have
a
special
job
for
you,

-

Destroy
Zeus!
Oh,
we're
in
trouble!
My
lord
and
lady,
and
they're
practically
at
our
gates!
Sound
the
alarm!
-
Go!
Go!

Huh?
Charge!
Yah!
On
to
battle!

Eeyah!
You
windbag!

Boom,
badda-boom,
boom,
boom!

CYCLOPS:
Hercules!
Where
are
you?

What
can
we
do?
-
Where
is
Hercules?
Hercules!
Come
out!
Face
me!
What
are
you
doing?
There
are
worse
things.
Run!
Wait!
Stop!
-
Hey,
look!
It's
Hercules.
-
We're
saved!
You
mighty
Hercules.



-
Oh!
-

Easy,
horsefeathers.
-

Listen.
Hercules
is
in
trouble.
We've
gotta
find
Phil.
He's
the
only
one
-

Get
back,
blast
you!

-
Ooh,
Chihuahua.
Come
on!
Hurry
up!
-
Phil!
Phil,
Hercules
needs
your
help!
What
does
he
need
me
for
-
He
won't
listen
to
me.
Look,
I
know
what
I
did
was
wrong,
It's
about
him.
I
need
more
thunderbolts!
Hephaestus
has
been
captured,
Everyone's
been
captured.
Hey,
hey!
Watch
the
glasses.
Zeusy,
I'm
home!
Hades.
You're
behind
this!
You
are
correct,
sir!


Flea.

-
Hercules!
Come
on,
kid.
Come
on.
Fight
back.
Come
on,
you
can
take
this
bum.
You
were
right
all
along,
Phil.
Dreams
are
for
rookies.
No,
no,
no,
no,
kid.
I
came
back
I'm
willing
to
go
the
distance.
How
'bout
you?


Me
bite
off
head!


Whoa,
baby!


Hercules!
Look
out!
Meg!
No!

What's
happening?

Hades'
deal
is
broken.
He
promised
I
wouldn't
get
hurt.
Meg.
Why
did
you...
You
didn't
have
to...
Oh,
people
always
do
crazy
things
Oh,
Meg.
Meg,
I...
I...
Are
you
always
this
articulate?

You
haven't
got
much
time.
I'll
watch
over
her,
kid.
You're
gonna
be
all
right.
I
promise.

Let's
go,
Pegasus!
Hup,
two,
three,
four.
-
I
can't
hear
you!
I
swear
to
you,
Hades,
I'm
the
one
giving
orders
now,
bolt
boy.
And
I
think
I'm
gonna
like
it
here.
HERCULES:

Hercules!
This
ought
to
even
the
odds!
Yeah,
Hercules!
Thank
you,
man.
Get
them!
Whoa!
Hey!
No!
Get
him!
Not
me!
Him!
Follow
the
fingers!
Him!

Thank
you,
my
boy.
Nice
horsey!
My
intentions
were
pure!

Throw!
Hah!
Now
watch
your
old
man
work!
Uh-oh.
Guys,
get
your
titanic
rears
in
gear
Whoa,
is
my
hair
out?

-
Hah!

Thanks
a
ton,
Wonderboy.
But
at
least
a
friend
of
yours
who's
dying
to
see
me.
-

Meg.

Meg,
no.

Oh,
I'm
sorry,
kid.

There's
some
things
Yes,
I
can.

We
were
so
close!
So
close.
We
tripped
at
the
finish
line.
Why?
Because
our
little
nut,
Meg,

-
Where's
Meg?
Wonderboy,
you
are
too
much.
-
Let
her
go.
Come
here,
come
here.
Hmph.
Well,
well.
Meg!
Ahhh!
No,
no,
no.
Mustn't
touch.
You
see,
Meg's
And
not
a
very
lively
one,
at
that.
You
like
making
deals.
Well.
The
son
of
my
hated
rival
-
Going
once.
-
Going
twice!
You
get
her
out.
She
goes,
you
stay.
You
know
what
slipped
my
mind?
You'll
be
dead
That's
not
a
problem,
is
it?
Oh!
What's
the
matter
with
these
scissors?
The
thread
won't
cut.
This
is...
This
is
impossible!
You
can't
be
alive!
You'd
have
to
be
a...
-
A
god?

Hercules,
stop!

Fine.
Okay.
Listen.
Okay.
Well,
I
deserved
that.
Your
dad,
he's
a
fun
guy,
right?
So
maybe
you
could
and
he'd
kinda
blow
this
Meg,
Meg,
talk
to
him.

Eww!
Get
away
from
me!
Get
your
slimy
souls
off
me!
He's
not
gonna
be
happy
You
mean,
if
he
gets
outta
there.
-
If.
If
is
good.
I
don't
feel
so
good.
I
feel
a
little...


Wonderboy,
what...
-
Why
did
you...
People
always
do
crazy
things
when
they're
in
love.
Whoa!
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Whoo!

Three
cheers
for
the
mighty
Hercules!
Oh,
yeah!
Flowers
for
everybody!
Oh!

Hercules,
we're
so
proud
of
you.
Mother.
Hah!
Fine
work,
my
boy!
You've
done
it!
You're
a
true
hero.
You
were
willing
to
give
your
life
For
a
true
hero
isn't
measured
but
by
the
strength
of
his
heart.
Now,
at
last,
my
son,
you
can
come
home.

Congratulations,
Wonderboy.

Father,
this
is
the
moment
But...
A
life
without
Meg,
would
be
empty.
I...
I
wish
to
stay
on
Earth
with
her.
I
finally
know
where
I
belong.

Hit
it,
ladies!
-
Gonna
shout
it
from
the
mountaintops
-
It's
the
time
for
pulling
out
the
stops
-
Honey
hit
us
with
a
hallelu
Girl,
sing
the
song
-
Come
blow
your
horn
-
He's
a
hero
who
can
please
the
crowd
Come
on,
everybody
shout
out
loud
Just
remember
in
the
darkest
hour
For
makin'
you
a
hero,
too
So
don't
lose
hope
when
you're
forlorn
That's
Phil's
boy!
Just
keep
your
eyes
upon
the
skies
Every
night,
a
star
is
-
Burning
bright,
a
star
is
born
Like
a
beacon
in
the
cold
dark
night
Told
ya
everything
would
turn
out
right
Just
when
everything
was
all
at
sea
-
The
bottom
line
-
He
sure
can
shine
His
rising
sign
is
Capricorn
He
knew
how
to
Telling
you
a
star
is
born
-
Here's
a
hero
who
can
please
a
crowd
-
Come
on,
everybody,
shout
out
loud
Just
remember
in
the
darkest
hour
-
For
makin'
you
a
hero
too
-
So
don't
lose
hope
when
you're
forlorn
Just
keep
your
eyes
Every
night,
a
star
is
Right
in
sight,
a
star
is
Burning
bright
I
have
often
dreamed
Of
a
far
off
place
Where
a
hero's
welcome
Would
be
waiting
for
me
Where
the
crowds
will
cheer
When
they
see
my
face
And
a
voice
keeps
sayin'
This
is
where
I'm
meant
to
be
I'll
be
there
someday
I
can
go
the
distance
I
will
find
my
way
If
I
can
be
strong
I
know
every
mile
Will
be
worth
my
while
When
I
go
the
distance
Where
I
Belong
Down
an
unknown
road
You
embrace
my
fears
Though
that
road
may
wander
It
will
lead
me
to
you
And
a
thousand
years
Would
be
worth
the
wait
It
might
take
a
lifetime
But
somehow
I'll
see
it
through
And
I
won't
look
back
I
can
go
the
distance
And
I'll
stay
on
track
No,
I
won't
accept
defeat
It's
an
uphill
slope
But
I
won't
lose
hope
Till
I
go
the
distance
Is
complete
Oh,
yeah
But
to
look
beyond
the
glory
Is
the
hardest
part
For
a
hero's
strength
is
measured
By
his
heart
Hoo
Like
a
shooting
star
I
will
go
the
distance
I
will
search
the
world
I
will
face
its
harms
I
don't
care
how
far
I
can
go
the
distance
Till
I
find
my
hero's
welcome
Waiting
in
Your
arms
I
will
search
the
world
I
will
face
its
harms
Till
I
find
my
hero's
welcome
Waiting
in
Your
arms
HADES:
What
d'ya
say?
Everybody's
got
a
little
taste
I
got
nothin'.
I'm
here
with
nothin'.
It's
like
I'm...
Hello?
Hello?
Am
I
talking
to,
what?
Nobody
listens.
