Don't
worry,
this
is
actually
This
is
the
story
of
a
girl
named,
And
it
starts,
with
the
sun.
Now,
once
upon
a
time,
a
single
And
from
this
small
drop
of
sun,
It
had
the
ability
to
heal
the
sick,
Oh,
you
see
that
old
woman,
You
might
want
to
remember
her.
She's
kind
of
important.
Well,
centuries
pass
and
a
hop
The
kingdom
was
ruled
by
a
beloved
And
the
Queen,
well
she
was
about
but
she
got
sick,
really,
sick.
She
was
running
out
of
time.
And
that's
when
people
usually
start
Or
in
this
case,
a
magic
golden
flower.
Ahhh,
I
told
you
she'd
You

instead
of
sharing
the
this
woman,
Mother
Gothel,
and
used
it
to
keep
herself
And
all
she
had
to
do,
Mother
Gothel:

Flynn:
All

the
jist.
She
sings
Guard:
We've
found
it!
Flynn:
The
magic
of
the
golden
flower,
A
healthy
baby
girl,
With
beautiful
golden
hair.

I'll
give
you
a
hint.
That's
Rapunzel.
To
celebrate
her
birth,

And
for
that
one

and
just
like
that...gone.
The
Kingdom

and
searched,
For
deep
within
the
forest
In
a
hidden
tower.
Gothel

the
child
Rapunzel:
*...take
what

been
lost,
bring
back
what
Flynn:
Gothel
had
found
her
new
magic
flower.
But
this
time
she
was
determined
Rapunzel:
Why
can't
I
go
outside?
The
outside
world
is
a
dangerous
place.
Filled
with
horrible,
selfish
people.
-Gothel:
You
must
stay
here,
where
you're
safe.

Yep,
I'm
used
to
it.
We

Oh,

Yeah.
Huh?
Guard:
Wait,
wait.
Can't
you
picture
me
in
a
castle
of

I
certainly
can.
Flynn's
voice
fades:
Oh,
the
things
we've
seen
and
Gentlemen,

is
a
very
big
day.
This
is
it.
This
is
I'm
finally
going
to
do
it.

going
to
ask
her.
Gothel:
Let
down
your
hair.
It's
time.
I
know,
I
know.
Come
on,
don't
Gothel:
Rapunzel,
I'm
not
getting
any
Coming,
mother.
Hi,
welcome
home,
mother.
Oh,
Rapunzel.
How
you
manage
to
do
without
fail,
it
looks
absolutely
Oh,
it's
nothing.
Then
I
don't
know
why
it

Oh,
darling.
I'm
just
teasing.
All
right...so,
mother.
Rapunzel
look
in
that
mirror.
I
see
a
strong,
confident,
Oh
look,
you're
here
too.
I'm
just
teasing,
stop
taking
Okay,
so
mother.
As
I
was
saying,
tomorrow...
Rapunzel,
mother's
feeling
a
little
run
down.
Would
you
sing
for
me,
dear?
-Then
we'll
talk.

*Heal
what
has
been
hurt,
Change
the
fate's
design.
-Rapunzel!
Earlier
I
was
saying
that
tomorrow
was

I'm
just
going
to
tell
you.
TADA!
No,

no

be.
I
distinctly
remember.
Your
That's
the
funny
thing
about
birthdays.
Mother,
I'm
turning
eighteen.
And
I
wanted
to
ask,
Actually
what
I
want
for
Rapunzel
please,
stop
with
the
mumbling.
You
know
how
I
feel
about
the
mumbling.
Blah,
blah,
blah,...blah.
I'm
just
teasing,
you're
adorable
Oh,
I
want
to
see
the
floating
lights.
-What?
Well
I
was
hoping
you
would
Oh,
you
mean
the
stars.
That's
the
thing
Rapunzel:
I've
charted
stars
and
they're
But
these,
they
appear
every
year
Only
on
my
birthday.
And
I
can't
help
but
feel
like
they're,
They're
meant
for
me.
I
need
see
them,
Mother.
In
person.
I
have
to
know
what
they
are.
You
want
to
go
outside?
Oh,
why
Rapunzel.
Look
at
you,
as

-*You
know
why
we
stay
up
in
this
tower*

right,
to
keep
you
safe,

Don't

ask
to
Yes,
Mother.
Ahh,
I
love
you
very
much,
dear.
I
love
you
more.
I
love
you
most.
*Don't

it.*
*You'll
regret
it.*

Gothel:
Ta,
ta,
I'll
see
you
I'll
be
here.

No,
no
no.
This
is
bad,
this
is
They
just
can't
get
my
nose
right.
Who
cares.
Well
it's
easy
for
you
to
say.
You
guys
look
amazing.

Flynn:
All
right,
okay.
Give
me
a
boost,
Give
us
the
satchel
first.
Wha..?
I
just...
I
can't
believe,
that
after
all
you
don't
trust
me.

Ouch.
Now
help
us
up,
pretty
boy.
Sorry,
my
hands
are
full.
What?
RYDER!

-Retrieve
that
satchel
with
any
force.

We
got
him
now,
Maximus.
Heeyah!
Heeyah!
Come
flea-bag,
forward.
No.
No,
stop
it.
Stop
it.
Give
it
to
me.
Give...it...back!

HAH!

-AAAAAAH!






Alone
at
last.




Huh?


Hmm?
Aah!
((Shoop...shoop,
Okay,
okay,
I
got
a
person
I've
got
a
person
in
my
closet.
I've
got
a
person
in
my
closet!
To
weak
to
handle
myself
Well,
Tell
that
to
my
frying
pan.
Hmmm?
Hmmm.
Gothel:
Rapunzel!
Gothel:
Let
down
your
hair.
One
moment,
Mother.
I
have
a
big
surprise.
Uh,
I
do
too.
Oh,
I
bet
my
surprise
is
bigger.
I
seriously
doubt
it.
I
brought
back
parsnips.
I'm
going
to
make
Surprise!
Well
mother,
there's
something
Oh
Rapunzel,
you
know
I
hate
Especially
when
I've
done
Okay,
I've
been
thinking
a
lot
I
hope
you're
not
still
talking
Floating
lights,
and
yes
Because
I
really
thought
No
Mother,
I'm
just
saying,
you
think
I'm
not
strong
enough
Oh
darling,
I
know
you're
not
strong
-But
if
you
just...
-Trust
me,...
-...I
know
what
I'm
-Oh,
come
on.
You
are
not
leaving
this
tower,
Oh,
great.
Now
I'm
the
bad
guy.
All
I
was
gonna
say,
mother
I
know
what
I
want
for
my
And
what
is
that?
New
paint.
That
paint
made
from
Well
that
is
a
very
long
trip,
Almost
three
day's
time.
I
just
thought
it
was
a
You
sure
you'll
be
all
right,
I
know
I'm
safe,
as
long

Gothel:
I'll
be
back
in
three
days
time.
I
love
you
very
much,
dear.
Rapunzel:
I
love
you
more.
Gothel:
I
love
you
most.


Whispers:
Okay.


Hmm.





AHHH!

Flynn:
Is
this...hair?
Rapunzel:
Struggling...struggling
is
pointless.
Huh?
Rapunzel:
I
know
why
you're
here.
And
I'm
not
afraid
of
you.
What?
Who
are
you,
and
how
Ah
hah.
Who
are
you,
and
how

Says
in
noble
voice:
I
know
not
who
you
are.
Nor
how
I
came
to
find
you.
But
may
I
just
say.
Says
in
lecherous
voice:
Hi!
How
you
doing?
The
name's
Flynn
Ryder.
Flynn
mumbles:
Who
else
knows
my
location,
-All
right,
Blondie.
Gesundheit,
here's
the
deal.
I
was
in
a
situation,
I
came
across
your
tower
and...
Ho,
oh
no,
where
is
my
satchel?
I've
hidden
it,
somewhere
you'll
It's
in
that
pot,
isn't
it.

Huh?
Ahh,
will
you
stop
that.
Now
it's
hidden
where
you'll
never
find
it.
So,
what
do
you
want,
-To
cut
it?
-Sell
it?
Listen,
the
only
thing
I
want
is
to
get
out
of
it.
Wait,
you
don't
want
my
hair?
Why
on
earth
would
Look,
I
was
being
chased,
I
saw
a
You're,
telling
the
truth?
Yes.
Hmmm.
I
know,
I
need
someone

Doesn't
have
fangs,

Uh,
okay
Flynn
Ryder,
-Deal?
Oh...oomph!
Do
you
know
what
these
are?
Nasal
voice:
You
mean
the
lantern
thing
Lanterns?
I
knew
they
weren't
stars.
Well,
tomorrow
evening
with
these
lanterns.
Take
me
to
these
lanterns,
Then,
and
only
then,
will
That
is
my
deal.
Yeah,
no
can
do.
Unfortunately,
the
kingdom
and
I
at
the
moment.
So
I
Something
brought
you
here,
-Call
it
what
you
will,
fate,
destiny.
So
I
have
made
the
decision
to
A
horrible
decision,
really.
But
trust
me,
when
I
tell
you
this.
You
can
tear
this
tower
apart,
But
without
my
help,
you
will
Let
me
just
get
this
straight.
I
take
you
to
see
the
lanterns.
Bring
you
back
home,
and
you'll
give
me
back
my
satchel?
I
promise.
And
when
I
promise
something,
I
never
EVER!
All
right,
listen,
I
didn't
want
but
you
leave
me
no
choice.
Here
comes
the
'smolder'.
*sexy
music*
This
is
kind
of
an
off
day
for
me.
This
doesn't
normally
happen.
Fine,
I'll
take
you
to
see
the
lanterns.
Really!
-Ooops.
You
coming,
Blondie?
*Look
at
the
world
so
close,
and
I'm
*Look
at
it
all,
so
big
*Look
at
me,
here
at
last
Should
I?
No.
*Here
I
go.*

*Triumphant
music*

*Just
feel
that
summer
breeze.*
*The
way
it's
calling
me.*

*I
could
go
running,
and
racing,
*and
chasing,
and
leaping
*Hair
flying,
heart
pounding
*And
finally
feeling,*
*That's
when
my
life
I
can't
believe
I
did
this.
I
can't
believe
I
did
this.
Mother
would
be
so
furious.
But
that's
okay,
whatever
she
doesnt

Oh
my
gosh,
this
would
kill
her.

THIS
IS
SO
FUN!

I
am
a
horrible
daughter,

I
am
never
going

I
am
a
despicable
human
being.
WAHHOOOOO!
Best
day,
ever!


You
know,
I
can't
help
but
notice,
you
seem
a
little
at
war
-What?
of
course,
over
protective
mother,
I
mean,
this
is
serious
stuff.
But
let
me
ease
your
conscious.
This
is
part
of
growing
up.
A
little
rebellion,
a
little
adventure.
That's
good,
healthy
even.

You
think?
I
know.
You're
way
over
thinking
Does
your
mother
deserve
it?
Will
this
break
her
heart
Of
course.
Break
her
heart?
-In
half.

She
would
be
heart
broken,
I
am,
aren't
I,
oh
bother.
All
right,
I
can't
believe
I'm
I'm
letting
you
out
of
the
deal.
-What?
Flynn:
But
don't
thank
me.
Let's
and
get
you
home,
here's
I
get
back
my
satchel.
You
get
back
a
mother
based
on
mutual
trust
and
viola!
-No,
I
am
seeing
those
lanterns.
What
is
it
going
to
take
I
will
use
this.


Is
it,
ruffians,
thugs?
Stay
calm,
it
can
probably
smell
fear.
Oh,
sorry.
Guess
I'm
just
a
little
bit,
jumpy.
Probably
be
best
if
we
avoid

Are
you
hungry?
-Where?
You'll
know
it
when
you
smell
it.





Oh,
a
Palace
horse.
Where's
your
rider?
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Rapunzel,
let
down
your
hair.
Rapunzel?


Rapunzel!
Frantically:
RAPUNZEL!


Flynn:
I
know
it's
around
here,
somewhere.
Ah,
there
it
is.
Flynn:
The
Snuggly
duckling.
Don't
worry,
very
quaint
place,
Don't
want
you
scaring,
and
giving
-Well,
I
do
like
duckling.
Garcon,
your
finest
table,
please.



You
smell
that?

What
are
you
getting?
and
the
other
part
is
I
don't
know
why,
but
overall,
Your
thoughts?
That's
a
lot
of
hair.
She's
growing
it
out,
is
that
blood
Goldie,
look
at
this,
look
at
Flynn:
Look
sir,
that's
a
lot
of
blood.

Hey,
you
don't
look
so
good,
Blondie.
Maybe
we
should
get
you
home.
Probably
be
better
off.
This
is
a
five
And
if
you
can't
handle
this
place,
well

Flynn:
No,
no
this
is
being
mean.
Oh,
it's
him
all
right.
Gretel,
go
find
some
guards.
That
reward's
going
to
I
can
use
the
money.
What
about
me?
-Boys,
stop!
Hey,
leave
him
alone.
-Gentlemen,
please.
HOO,
HAH,
HOO,
HOO!
Flynn:
Whoaa!
Flynn:
Not
the
nose,
not
the
nose,
Put
him
down!
Okay,
I
don't
know
where
I
am,
because
I've
been
dreaming
about
Find
your
humanity.
Havent
any
of
you
ever
had
a
dream?
I,
had
a
dream.
Once.

Go,

Thanks
for

I

Sir,
there's

Where
does

Knife!

Flynn:
Well,
that
got
us
safe.
Didn't
know
you
had
that
in
you
Excitedly:
I
KNOW!
Subdued:
I
know...
Sooo,

Where
are
you
from?
Whoa,

I'm

Here's
my
question
though,
if
you
want
why
haven't
you
gone
before?
Uhh,
heh,
well...


Flynn!

Run,

Who's
that?
They
don't
like
me.
-Rapunzel:
Who's
that?
-Rapunzel:
Who's
that?
that
everyone
here
doesn't
like
me.
Here.

I've
waited
a
long
time
for
this.


Oh
mama,
I
have
got
to
get
me
HAH!

You
should
know
that
this
is
How
'bout

Flynn!
Flynn,
look
out.
-Whoa,
WHOAAA!
You
should
see
your
faces.

Ridiculous

Flynn:
Come
on,
Blondie.
Jump.





Rapunzel:
Aaaah!





It's
no
use,

Hey,
there's
no
point.
It's
pitch
black
down
there.


This
is
all
my
fault.
She
was
right,
I
never

I'm
so...

I'm
so
sorry,
Flynn.

Eugene.

My

I
have
magic
hair

I

Whoa!


We

it.
Her

We're

didn't

that
coming.
-Rapunzel:
Eugene...
-Rapunzel:
EUGENE!
It
doesn't
just
glow.
Why
is
he
smiling
at
me?


I'll
kill
him.
I'll
kill

him
off

And

Gothel:
Boys.
Perhaps
you
want
to
stop
acting
and
think
for
a
moment.

Oh,
please
there's
no
Well
if
that's
all
you
desire,
I
was
going
to
offer
you
something
would
have
made

And
that
wasn't
even
the
best
part.
Oh
well,
C'est
la

Enjoy

your

What's
the
best
part?
It
comes
with
revenge

So
you're

No,
I'm

long
has
it
been
Forever,
I
guess.
Mother
said
when
I
was
a
baby
They
wanted
to
take
it
for
themselves.
But,
once
it's
cut.
It
turns
brown,
and
looses
its
power.
A
gift
like
that,
it
has
to
be
protected.
That's
why
Mother
never
let
me...

That's
why...I
never
left
the...
You
never
left
that
tower.
And
you're
still
gonna
go
back?
No...yes?
It's
complicated.
Aaaah.
So,
Eugene

huh?
Ah
yeah,
well.
I'll
spare
poor
orphan
Eugene
Fitzherbert,
it's
It's
a
little
bit
of
a
downer.
Heh.
There
was
this
book.
A
book
I
used
to
read
every

tales
of

Swashbuckling

Not
bad
with
the
ladies
either.
Nothing
Was
he
a
thief
too?
Ahh,
well
no.
Actually,
he
had
enough
He
could
go
anywhere
that
And...and,
for
a
kid,
I
don't
know,
I...
It
just
seemed
like
a
better
option.
You
can't
tell
anyone,
It
could
ruin
my
whole
reputation.
Ahh,
we
wouldn't
want
that.
Oh,
the
thing
about
a
reputation,

Um,
well
I
should
uh...
I,
I
should
get
some

Hey.
For
the
record,
I
like
Eugene
Fitzherbert
Well,
then
you'd
be
the
first.
But,
thank
you.
Well,
I
thought
he'd
never
leave.
Mother?
Hello,
dear.
Rapunzel:
But
I...I...,
don't
we...
How
did
you
find
me?
Oh,
it
was
easy
really.
I
just
listened
for
the
sound
of
-Mother...
-Now.
I've
been
on
this
incredible
journey.
And
I've
seen
and
learned
so
much.
I
even
met
someone.
Yes,
the
wanted
thief.
-Come
on,
Rapunzel.
I
think
I
think
he
likes
me.
Likes
you?
Please,
Rapunzel,
-But
mother,
I...
Dear
this
whole
romance
that
just
proves
you're
to
naive
to
be
here.
Why
would
he
like
you?
Look
at
you,
you
think
Don't
be
a
dummy,
come
with
mommy.
*Mother...*
-NO!
Oh.
I
see
how
it
is.
*Rapunzel,
knows
best.*
*Rapunzel's
so
mature,
now.*
*Such
a
clever
grown
up,
miss.*
*Rapunzel
knows
best.*
*Fine,
if
you're
so
sure
now.*
*Go
ahead
then
give
him,
THIS!*
How
did
you?
*This
is
why
he's
here.*
*Don't
let
him
deceive
you.*
*Give
it
to
him,
watch,
you'll
see.*

me

him,
to

he's
lying,
don't
come

shouts:
So,
hey
uh,
Flynn:
Is
there
any
chance
that
I'm
going
Because
I'm
not
going
to
lie.
Hey,
you
all
right?
Oh,
sorry,
yes.
Just
um,
lost
in
thought,
I
mean
because
here's
the
thing.
Superhuman
good
looks,
Born
with
it,
but
superhuman
strength?
Flynn:
Can
you
imagine
the
possibilities,
I'm
just...
Patience
boys.
All
good
things


Hmm,

Well

Excuse

Nobody
appreciates
Do

Oh

a
bad
horse.
Oh,

Isn't

Rapunzel:

Man:
To
the
boats
Hey,
Max.

What?
I
brought
them.
Most
of
them.
Where
are
we
going?
Well,
best
day
of
your
life.
I
figured
you
should
have
You
okay?
I'm
terrified.
Why?
I've
been
looking
out
the
Dreaming
about
what
it
would
feel
What
if
it's
not
everything
It
will
be.
And
what
if
it
is?
What
will
I
do
then?
Well
that's
the
good
part,
You
get
to
go
find
a
new
dream.

Music*

those
years

that
time

how
blind

been

in

I
see

oh,
so
clear
*And
at
last,
I
see
the
light

at
last,
I
see
the
light
*And
it's
warm
and
real
and
bright
*All
at
once
*Now
that
I
see
you*
I
have
something
for
you,
too.
I
should
have
given
it
to
you
And
the
thing
is,
You
know
what
I
mean?
I'm
starting
to.
Flynn:
*All
those
days
*All
those
years
*All
that
time
*Things,
the
way
they
were
*Shining
in
the
starlight
*Suddenly
I
know
*It's
crystal
clear
Both:
*And
at
last,
I
see
the
light*
*And
it's
like
the
fog
has
lifted*
*And
at
last,
I
see
the
light*
*And
it's
like
the
sky
is
new*
Both:
*And
it's
warm
and
real
and
bright
*All
at
once
*Now
that
I,
see
you.*
*Now
that
I...see
you.*
Rapunzel:
Is
everything
okay?
Huh?
Oh
yes.
Uh,
yes
of
course.
Flynn:
I
just...
Flynn:
I'm
sorry,
everything
is
fine.
There's
just
something
I
Okay.
I'll
be
right
back.
It's
all
right,
Pascal.
Flynn:
Ahh,
there
you
are.
I've
been
searching
everywhere
for
Hey
the
sideburns
are
coming
You
gotta
be
excited
about
that.
Anyhow,
just
wanted
to
say,
I
shouldn't
have
split.
I'll
miss
you,
but
I
think
Holding
out
on
us
again?
-What?
Something
much
more
valuable
We
want
her,
instead.

I
was
starting
to
think
you
He
did.
What?
He
wouldn't.
See
for
yourself.
Eugene?
Eugene!

How
much
do
you
think
someone
No,

NO!
NO!
AHH!

Gothel:
Rapunzel!
Mother?
Oh,
my
precious
girl.
Mother.
Are
you
all
right?
Are
you
hurt?
-Mother,
how
did
you?
So
I
followed
you.
And
I
saw
them
attack
you.
All
right,
let's
go,
let's
go

Rapunzel:
You
were
right,
mother.
You
were
right
about
everything.
Gothel:
I
know
darling.
I
know.

Look!
Guard:
The
crown.
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Flynn:
No,
no,
no.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Flynn:
Rapunzel!

Let's
get
this
over
with,
Ryder.
Where
are
we
going?
Oh...
Gothel:
There,
Now,
wash
up
for
dinner.
I'm
making
hazel
nut
soup.
I
really
did
try,
Rapunzel.
I
tried
to
warn
you,
The
world
is
dark,
and
selfish,
and
cruel.
If
it
finds
even
the
slightest
It
destroys
it.





How
did
you
know
about
her?
Tell
me,
now!
It
wasn't
us.
It
was
the
old
lady.
Old
lady?
Wait,
no,
wait!
You
don't
understand,
Flynn:
Wait!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel,
what's
going
on
up
there?

Are
you
all
right?
I'm
the
lost
princess.
Oh,
please,
speak
up,
Rapunzel.
I
am
the
lost
Princess.
Aren't
I?
Did
I
mumble,
Mother?
Or
should
I
even
call
you
that?
Oh,
Rapunzel,
do
you
even
hear
yourself?
Why
would
you
ask
such
It
was
you!
Everything
I
did,
was
to
protect
you.
-Rapunzel.
...hiding
from
people
who
-Rapunzel!
From
you.
Where
will
you
go?
Gothel:
He
won't
be
there
for
you.
Rapunzel:
What
did
you
do
to
him?
Gothel:
That
criminal,
is
to
-
No.
Listen
to
me.
All
of
this
is
as
Rapunzel:
NO!
You
were
wrong
about
the
world.
And
you
were
wrong
about
me.
And
I
will
never
let
you

You
want
me
to
be
the
bad
guy?
Fine.
Now
I'm
the
bad,
guy.



What's
this?

What's
the
password?
-What?
Open
this
door.
Not
even
close.
You
have
three
seconds

Two...
Three...?

Frying
pans.

AAAAH!

Max.
You
brought
them
here?
Thank
you.
No
really,
thank
you.
Uh,
I
feel
maybe
this
whole
time
And
we're
really
just,
yeah


Max?
Max!
WHOAAAAA!

Okay
Max,
lets
see
how

Rapunzel.
Rapunzel,
let
down
your
hair.
*Triumphant
music*
Rapunzel,
I
thought
I'd
never
Huh?



Now
look
what
you've
done,
Oh
don't
worry,
dear.
Gothel:
Our
secret
will
die
with
him.
Gothel:
And
as
for
us?
We
are
going
where
no
one


Rapunzel,
really.
Stop
fighting
me.
NO!
I
won't
stop.
For
every
minute
of
the
rest
I
will
never
stop
trying

But,
if
you
let
me
save
him...
I
will
go
with
you.
Flynn
moans:
No.
No,
Rapunzel.
I'll
never
run,
I'll
never
Just
let
me
heal
him.
And
Forever,
just
like
you
want.
Everything
will
be
I
promise.
Rapunzel:
Just
like
you
want.
Just...let
me...heal
him.

-Eu..Eugene!
Ah,
AHHH!
Rapunzel:
Oh,
I'm
so
sorry.
-Everything
is
going
to
okay,
though.
-I
promise,
you
have
to
trust
me.
-Come
on.
And
I
can't
let
you
die.
-But
if
you
do
this.
-Then
you...will
die.
It's
gonna
be
all
right.
Rapunzel,
wait...

Eugene,
what...?
NOOO!

No...NO!
What
have
you
done?
No!
No!
No,
no,
no,
noooo.
Aaah!
Noooooooooo!

No,
no,
no,
no,
Eugene.

Oh,
look
at
me,
look
me,
Don't
go,
stay
with
me,
Eugene.
*Flower

The
kingdom
rejoiced.
For
the
lost

had
returned.
The
party
lasted
an
entire
week.
And,

I
don't

Pascal?
At
last
Rapunzel
was
home,
and
she
finally
had
a
real
family.
She
was
a
Princess
worth
Beloved
by
all,
she
led
her
kingdom
with
all
the
grace
and
wisdom
that
And
as
for
me,
well.
I
started
going
by
Eugene
again.
Stopped
thieving,
and
basically
But
I
know
what
the
big
question
is.
Did
Rapunzel
and
I
ever
get
married?
Well
I'm
pleased
to
tell
you.
That
after
years,
and
years
of
asking,
and
asking,
and
asking.
I
finally
said
yes.
Rapunzel:
*Eugene*
All
right,
I
asked
her.
Rapunzel:
And
we're
living
happily
ever
after.
Yes,
we
are.
