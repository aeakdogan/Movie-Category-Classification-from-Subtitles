-What
seems
to
be

Look
up.
So

Ooh!
Aw!

Let
us
know
-Good
morning,
Marley.
Is
it?
I'm
about
to
get
a
huge
camera

I
don't
know
I
just
need
you
to

um,
colon
cancer.
Because
I
did.
-he
said...
Of
course
you
don't.

going
to
consult
with

Can,
can,
can
you

Marley,
I'm
sorry
I
have
to
say
this,
-Wait.
What
are
you
saying?
The
chemo
hasn't
worked
And
the
tumours
What
now?
There
is
one
particular
clinical
trial
Although,
typically
with
patients
Success
like
people
cured?
-Yeah.
It's
a
series
of
treatments,
It's
injected
into
the
affected
areas.
The
objective
is
to
stop
or
slow
down
It's
an
option.
But
you
need
to
be
aware
that

are
no
guarantees.
Of

know
about

-He
said
they're
pretty
good.

that's
it?
You're
going

no,
I
flipped
a
coin.

responds
Ow!
Can
I

No.
I'm

you
cannot.

You
need
to
wake
up
and
realize
-Can
we
not
do
this
here.
You
always
bitch
about
and
here
you
are
like
protein
and
a
designer
dress
Ahhhh!
This
is
the
car.
This
one.
-Was
it
really
that
bad?
-it's
just
that
she
drives
me
crazy.
That's
her
job.
-Thanks
for
everything.
Ah.
OW.
Ah.
Marley.
Hey.
it's
okay.
Just
give
me
a
second.
It's
gonna
be
okay.
-Is
she
gonna
be
alright?
A
couple
of
bags
of
saline
She
is
right
here,
people.
'Shop
till
you
drop'
Not
bad.
That's
the
best
thing
Dr
G.
-Ah,
hi.
GI
extra
ordinaire.
-Pleased
to
meet
you.
I...
I'm
suddenly
in
the
mood
for
some
Jell-O.
Really?
Jell-O?
-I'm
good.
Thanks.
Strangely,
she's
not
so
good
-So
what
happened?
-sudden,
searing
pain.
Come
on,
doc.
Level
with
me.
Is
all
this
really
Yeah,
um--
well
just
-tell
me
where
exactly...
Sorry.
Well,
there
was
a
pain
in
my
ass,
Marley,
come
on.
Is
there
a
woman
with
a
very
big
needle
Ow!
That's
my
skin
I'm
sorry.
I
can't
seem
Let
me
try.
Dr
G?
I
think
I
found
one.
I
don't
know
how
it's
doing
but
this
treatment
Two
down,
eight
to
go.
Hey,
Marley.
Hey.
Marley.
-Hi.
Hey,
Marley.
There's,
um,
there's
a
fund
raiser
-Oh,
nice.
Sorry.
I'm
just
going
to
walk
over
there
I
wanted
to
see
Not
come
with
me
as
a
date,
It's
semi-formal,
so
I
don't
know
I
can't
tell
if
you're
trying
-or
talk
yourself
out
of
it.
-I'll
see
how
I
feel
Saturday.
-Sorry.
Thank
you.
Bye.
Where,
besides
your
life
and
General
I
mean--
come
on!
Hello,
Marley.
It's
your
father.
First
of
all,
I
don't
appreciate
Stanley
meta
really
cute
Shitszu
today.
I'm
not
saying
you
should,
you'd
probably
start
BullShits.
BullShit
Terriers.
Okay.
Someone
needs
comfort
food.
I'm
gonna
go
home
and
fix
you
So
later
on
when
your
doorbell
rings,
you
answer
it.
Okay?
Okay.
Beautiful.
You
Marley?
-Yeah.
These
are
for
you.
Thank
you.
l--
whoa,
whoa.
-I
love
you.
Ah.
How
do
you
know
Peter?
Who?
I
got
a
call
from
work
Especial
Escorts.
I'm
really
sorry.
Well,
you
should
know
Little
Bit
of
Heaven.
Oh!
That
is
some
offer,
but,
um,
no.
-Oh,
don't
forget
your
flowers.
Beautiful
flowers
Thank
you.
Actually,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
rude,
I'm
sick.
There
isn't
anything
to
be
afraid
of.
I've
died
twice
Really?
like
bright
lights
or
anything?
No.
It
Was,
uh,
It
was
real
nice.
I
could
have
floated
there
forever.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Marley.
Nice
to
meet
you.
Vinnie!
Alright,
I'm
going
all
in.
Because
I
got
the
nuts.
So
you
should
probably
fold,
What
are
you
doing?
Or
I'm
bluffing.
Fold.
-Ohhh!
-Okay.
See?
-Smart.
-Are
you
really
single?
Hardly
qualifies
me
for
being
Why?
Most
of
the
great
romances
Romeo
and
Juliet.
-Siegfried
and
Roy.
Roy
is
not
dead.
Well,
he
didn't
look
too
good.
-I
haven't
found
the
right
guy
yet.
Who
wouldn't
want
a
girl
like
you?
You
are
just
afraid
to
let
them
in,
because
if
you
do
and
they
reject
you,
-Sigmund
Freud
all
of
a
sudden?
Actually,
a
guy
I
like
asked
me
out
He
said
it
wasn't
a
date.
-What
time
does
it
start?
-Dinner
and
a
movie?
-Formal?
-He's
an
idiot.
Well,
maybe
he'll
wise
up
If
not,
fuck
him.
Would
you
mind
doing
me
a
favour?
:
Oh,
I
like
that.
:
Yeah,
a
little
bit
of
heaven?
-You
want
more
heaven?
You
want
a
whole
lot
of
heaven?
-:
Ooh!
Oh,
my
God,
baby.
Oh,
my.
Oh,
my
God.
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
:
Ohhh!
:
Oh,
oh.
:
OW,
the
bottle.
Ow,
ow.
-Oh.
-Wow!
Oh,
my.
WOW,
Vinnie.
-Oh.
-Thank
you,
Vinnie.
I
had
so
much
fun.
See
what
happens
You
might
be
sore
in
the
morning.
-Goodbye.
See
ya.
-Is
there
a
doctor
in
the
house?
No
clue
what
you
just
said,
-Thank
you.
-No,
for
coming.
-Would
you
like
to
have
a
drink?
Okay.
There.
-I
have
a
good
one.
-A
joke.
-You
wanna
listen
to
it?
Okay,
um,
okay.
-I
give
up.
Because
you
only
get
laid
once,
you
take
10
minutes
to
get
hard
And
then
you
have
to
share
this
box
But
the--
worst
thing
is...
Oh,
it's
the
funny
part.

You
are
the
worst
joke
teller
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
that
the
only
person
to
ever
You're
just
hopeless.
-Ms
Corbett.
I'll
grab
an
appetizer.
-She's
a
brave
girl.
You
know
she
quit
the
trial.
NO,
l--
I
didn't
know
that.
It
seems
to
me
that
your
patient's
keeping
emotion
out
of
this
decision
I'm
just
trying
to
save
her
life.
Why
did
you
invite
her
here?
Because
there's
patients,
survivors.
The
line
is
there
for
a
reason,
Doctor.
You'll
need
to
think
about
-Hey,
can
I?
Thank
you.
What
did
I
miss?
-Do
you
wanna
get
out
of
here?
First
dinner,
then
a
surprise.
Let's
go.
What--
a
surprise
in
a
dark
alley?
-Do
you
really
know
where
we're
going?
Where
are
you
taking
me?
In
all
the
years
you've
been
here,
you've
never
been
Hey,
hey.
Hey,
Marley.
Hey.
-Hey.
Wow.
much.
Isn't
this
fun?
-Hey,
hey,
hey.
Hey-
Marley.
Hey-
Hey,
no,
wait.
No,
wait,
wait,
wait.
You
look
amazing.

You're
such
a
tranny
magnet.
If
I
wasn't
there,
you
could
have
I
know.
She
was
kind
of
hot,
no?
Ahhh.
Where
did
you
go?
Do
you
believe
in
God?
-Wow.
Okay,
if
you
ask
me,
Dr
Julian
Goldstein,
I
mean,
I
believe
in
science
no,
I
don't
believe
in
a
higher
power.
But
if
you
ask
me,
Julian,
Why?
I
envy
people
who
do.
They're
so
sure
What
a
great
way
to
live.
Without
fear.
What
are
you
afraid
of?
-No.
I
want
to
know.
-The
whole
list?
Fine.
I'm
afraid
if
I
die
Okay.
I
worry
about
who'd
take
care
Anything
else?
I'm
scared
this
entire
night
Ah.
So
this
is
a
date,
right?
Yeah--
It's
just
that
I--
I
quit
the
trial.
I
know.
-Why?
Besides,
and
you're
gonna
think
She
is
a
lady
who
knows

-You
don't.
Coming
from
a
guy
What?
You
have
a
problem
Well,
let
me
show
you.
Okay.
You
really
are
the
biggest
dork
That's
a
very
nice
thing
of
you
to
say,
but
it's
afar
better
compliment

I

to

I've
done

That
ship
sailed

know?
You're
just
scared.

down.
Woof.
Woof.
I'm
coming

are
we
doing?
Making
chit-chat
like
nothing's
wrong
-I'm
trying
to
have
a
nice
visit.
-What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
-No.
I'm
here
aren't
I?
-Marley,
come
on.
I'm
trying.
He's
trying.
Could
we
have
just
one
pleasant
meal?
-Fine.
No.
it's
not
fine.
So
we
need
to
talk
about
this
right
now,

may
never
see
you
again.
Marley,
wait!
I
don't
know
what
to
do,
kiddo.
Dad,
I
don't
want
to
have
to
tell
you.
And
I
shouldn't

you

sick
So
please
tell
me
what
to
say,
because
I
can't

Just
tell
me

You

you.

it.

I'm
not
gonna
get

I
know
he'll
be
beautiful.
Oh,
my
God,
that
little
girl
is
amazing.
So,
please,
when
she
gets
older
tell
her
that
I
loved
her
