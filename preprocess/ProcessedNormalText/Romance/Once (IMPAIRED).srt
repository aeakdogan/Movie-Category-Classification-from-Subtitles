#
For
it's
been
so
long
#
#
Since
I
have
seen
you
#
#
I
can
hardly
remember
#
When
I
get
pretty
lonely

#
And
the
distance

I
think
of
you
smiling
#
#
With
pride
in
your
eyes

#
Lover
that
sighs
#
#
If
you
want
me

To
be
a
better
one

figure
out

From
breathing
easy

And
talking
straight
#
#
The
way
is
clear
#
The
volunteer
#
And
taking
time
#
#
To
save
himself
#
#
The
little
cracks,
#
Before
we
knew
#
For
making
circles
#
#
And
telling
lies
#
#
And
I,
I
can't
#
Maybe
if
you
#
I
could
see
#
Lies,
lies,
lies
#
#
Breaking
us
down
with
your
#
#
Lies,
lies,
lies
#
#
When
will
you
learn?

#
The

I
can't
keep
up
with

Breaking
us
down
with
your

#
When
will
you
learn?
