Lydia!
Kitty!

Netherfield
Park
is
let
at
last.
Do
you
As
you
wish
to
tell
me,
my
dear,
Kitty,
what
have
I
told
you
There's
a
Mr
Bingley
-
Five
thousand
a
year!
-
He's
single!
A
Mr
Bingley,
apparently.
Kitty!
How
can
that
possibly
affect
them?.
Mr
Bennet,
You
know
he
must
marry
one
of
them.
That
is
his
design
in
settling
here?.
You
must
go
and
visit
him
at
once.
Good
heavens.
People.
For
we
may
not
visit
if
you
do
not,
-
Are
you
listening?.
You
never
listen.
There's
no
need.
I
already
have.
-
You
have?.
Oh,
Mr
Bennet,
Have
you
no
compassion
You
mistake
me,
my
dear.
They've
been
my
constant
companions
Papa!
-
Is
he
amiable?.
-
Is
he
handsome?.
With
5,000
a
year,
Who's
got
warts?.
I
will
consent
to
-
So
will
he
come
to
the
ball
tomorrow?.
-
Mr
Bennet!
-
I'll
lend
you
my
green
slippers!
-
I'll
do
your
mending
for
a
week.
Two
weeks
I'll
do
it
for.

It's
not
the
same!
I
can't
breathe.

I
think
one
of
If
every
man
does
not
end
the
evening
then
I'm
no
judge
of
beauty.

Or
men.
They're
not
all
bad.
Humourless
poppycocks,
One
day,
and
then
you'll
have
How
good
of
you
to
come.

on

The
person

brow?.

He

soul.
Tell
me.

The
miserable
half.

Mr
Bennet,
you
must
introduce
him
Smile
at
Mr
Bingley.
Smile.
Mary.
Mr
Bingley,
my
eldest
daughter
you
know.
Mrs
Bennet,
Miss
Jane
Bennet,
It
is
a
pleasure.
I
have
two
others,
I'm
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance.
And
may
I
introduce
Mr
Darcy
How
do
you
like
it
Very
much.
The
library
at
Netherfield,
It
fills
me
with
guilt.
I'm
not
a
good
Oh,
I
mean,
I
can
read,
of
course.
And
I'm
not
suggesting

I
wish
I
read
more,
but
there

That's
exactly
what
I
meant.
Mama,
Mama!
You
will
never,
ever
believe

Tell
me!
-
The

are
coming!
They're
going
to
be

Officers?.

Oh,
look.
Mr
Bennet.
-
Do
you
dance,
Mr
Darcy?.
I
didn't
know
you
were
coming
We
are
a
long
way
from
Grosvenor
Square,
I've
never
seen
so
many
pretty
girls.
You
were
dancing
She
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
-
But
her
sister
Elizabeth
is
agreeable.
Not
handsome
enough
to
tempt
me.
Return

Count
your
blessings,
Lizzie.
If
he
Precisely.
I
wouldn't
dance
with
him
Iet
alone
the
miserable
half.

Wait!
-
I
enjoyed
that
so
much,
Miss
Lucas.

My
daughter
Jane
She
is
indeed.
Your
friend
Miss
Lucas
Oh,
yes,
I
adore
her.
-
It
is
a
pity
she's
not
more
handsome.
Oh,
but
Lizzie
Of
course,
it's
my
Jane
who's
considered
Mama,
please!
When
she
was
1

a
gentleman
I
was
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer.
However,
he
did
write
her
And
that
put
paid
to
it.
I
wonder
who
discovered
the
power
-
I
thought
poetry
was
the
food
of
love.
But
if
it
is
only
a
vague
inclination,
So,
what
do
you
recommend
Dancing.
Even
if
one's
partner

Mr
Bingley
is
just
what
-
Sensible,
good-humoured...
Marriage
should
not
be
driven
Only
deep
love
-
Which
is
why
I'll
end
up
an
old
maid.
He
danced
with
you
most
of
the
night,
I
give
you
leave
to
like
him.
You're
a
great
deal
too
apt
All
the
world
Not
his
friend.
I
still
can't
believe
Mr
Darcy?.
I'd
more
easily
forgive
his
vanity
But
no
matter.

He
danced
with
Miss
Lucas.

We
were
all
there,
dear.
It
is
a
shame
she's
not
more
handsome.

Jane,
It
is

She
has
invited
me
to
dine
with
her.

Her
brother
will
be
dining
out.
-
Can
I
take
the
carriage?.
-
It
is
too
far
to
walk.
Mama,
the
carriage
for
Jane?.
Certainly
not.
She'll
go
on

Horseback!

Lizzie.
Now
she'll
have

If

to

I
must
ask,
what
is
the
manner
My
father
managed
his
estate.
We
grew
up
together,
Darcy
and

His
father
treated
me
like
a

We
were
both
with
him
the
day

died.
With

breath,
his
father
bequeathed
me
He
knew
I
had

heart
set
But
Darcy
ignored
his
wishes
-
But
why?.
His
father...
Well,
he
loved
me
better
-
How
cruel.
Too
lowly
even
to
be
noticed.

-
Breathe
in!
Betsy.
Betsy!
-
There
must've
been
a
misunderstanding.
How
could
Mr
Darcy
do
such
a
thing?.
I
will
discover
the
truth
Let
Mr
Darcy
contradict
it
himself.
Till
he
does,
Poor,
unfortunate,
Mr
Wickham.
