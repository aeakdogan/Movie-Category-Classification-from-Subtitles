you'll
say
yes.
I
need
you

I
can
do
that
Would
that
help?

For
the

up
to
you.
You,
too,
kiddo.
All
right?
Okay.
Okay,
here's
an
idea.
What
say
I
watch
while
you
do
your
presentation?
I
overheard
you
said
And
then
you
watch
them
while
I
do
the
column.
It'll
only
take,
you
know,
Hi.
Maggie
Taylor
calling.
I
have
an
urgent
message
for
stupid
Sammy
Parker.
I'm
not
stupid.

What
do
you
say?
I
don't
think
so.
I
only
let

watch
my
son.

Ha!
I'm
hungry,
Daddy.
Want
a
Tic-Tac?
Here,
baby.
What's
that?
Muffin.
You're
welcome,
sweetheart.
You
were
saying?
Well,
uh,
uh...
I
was
saying
that
maybe
we
could
help
each
other
out
today.
Well...
Hey.
Looks
like
you
missed
the
boat.
I
guess
we
did.
Hmm.
I
really
don't
need
your
help,
but
if
I
did,
you
would
be
the
very
last
person
These
are
the

She...
She,
um...
She
just
drops
off,
uh,
a
bag
of
cookies
and
tells
me
And
how
do
you
feel
Love
the
cookies.
I
have
a
big
problem
Cookie
maker?
That's
right.
Because
the
cookie
maker
or
all
that
I
am
uh,
with
respect
to
is
the...
-
The
frosting?
Exactly.
Now,
just
because
the
frosting
doesn't
mean
I
have
many
layers
to
me,
and
they're
not
I
have
chocolate
in
me.
I
have
a
deep,
I'm
still
hungry,
Daddy.
Uh,
don't...
Doc
Martin
and
I
are
finishing.
But
what
about
the
cookies?
Just
a
little
while.
Okay?
Uh,
it's
just...
I'm
sick
of
angry,
Fish
who,
uh,
think
that
you
that,
that,
that
you
owe
them,
but
who
won't
trust
you
to
do
anything
for
them.
There
are
other
fish
Yes.
I
know.
It's
just
I...
I
wish
I
could
find
a
fish
who
wasn't
afraid
of
And,
well,
she'd
have
You
know,
I
think,
I
think
that
my
ex
cookie
maker
has
turned
me
off
I
met
a
real
piece
Tell
me
about
her,
Jack.
This
fish
was
a
fox.
She
had
her
own
cookie,
too.
But
what
a
female
dog.
She
shoved
her
fish
in
my
face.
In
front
of
the
cookie?
What's
she
doing
with
Is

talking
about?

Because
I
want

next
to
me.

Sammy.

You're
kidding.
Just
5
minutes.
Please
don't
give
me
I'm
20
minutes
late.
25
minutes
late.
as
you
might
expect,
What
are
those?
The

not
even
sick.
He
just
missed
I
don't
think
so.
5
minutes.
Please?
And
I
would
be
doing
this
because?
Of
our
sense
of
solidarity?
You
know,
we're
both
women,
and
this
is
a
tough
office
-
and
a
tough
world...

Thank
you.

my
God.

you
ask
Miss

Would
you...
Go,

heading
there
You
see,
I
went
by
there,
to
pick
it
up
for
this
meeting,
but
the

was
locked,
so...

Mr.
Leland,
sir.
And
today,
at
2:00,
the
people

something
I'd
like

Ohh!
What
Also,

a
good
idea.
I'm
very
sorry,
sir,
but
someone
spilled
my
coffee
Oh,
my
God.
Do
you
know
that
I

what
I
think
of
No.

He's
not
a

monkey,
sir.
He
looks
like

go
find
his
mother.

Oh,
my
God.
I'm
really
sorry,
Mom.
Oh.
That's
okay,
sweetie.
It's
really
not
your
fault.
It's
Maggie's
daddy's
fault.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
This
isn't
a
very
good
That's
one
of
the
advantages
You
get
to
act
like
a
kid
Mommy
would
never
let
me
have
hamburgers
and
milk
shakes

always...
All
right,
darling,
listen.
If
you
speak
with
her
would
you
do
me
a
favor?
Her
sister
telephoned
me
to
see
if
I
would
but
I'm
in
the
middle
I
can't
possibly
cancel
now.
But,
uh,
tell
her
that
otherwise,
I
would
have
been
because
no
matter
I
have
forgotten
all
about
Sammy
putting
my
wedding
ring
I'll
tell
her,
Rita.
You're
adorable.
-
All
right.
Good-bye.


-
Hello?
How
did
you
get
this
number?
That's
my
phone
you're
holding.
This
is
so
typical
of
you.
Let's
bypass
the
hostilities
-
and
just
do
messages.
Your
mother's
in
the
middle
and
can't
baby-sit,
but
it's
not
because
sticking
her
ring
up
her
nose.
His
nose.
Thank
you.
You
have
a
press
conference
at
5:00.

Think
maybe
we
ought
to
arrange
to
switch
our
phones
back?
Tomorrow
morning
On
time?
-
Fine.
Maggie,
when
you
grow
up
and
you
are
incredibly
beautiful
and
intelligent
and
possess
a
certain
sweetness
that's
like
a
distant
promise
to
the
brave
and
to
the
worthy,
can
you
please
not
beat
to
a
pulp
every
miserable
bastard
just
because
you
can?
Can
you
just
not
do
that?
Okay,
Daddy.
All
right.
Uh,
let
me
help
you.
I
can
get
it.
-
No,
please!
Okay,
sweetie,
come
on.
Stupid
American
woman.
That
guy
called
you
stupid.
Well,
I
am
stupid
sometimes,
honey,
but
I'd
rather
be
stupid
MELANIE:
How
bad
is
it?
-
Well,
it's
modular...
...so
it's
conceivable.
I
could
lift
out
and
replace
it
from
the
model.
That
way,
I
wouldn't
have
Vincent,
that's
brilliant.

Sammy,
you
cannot
It
won't
be
perfect.
I'm
thirsty,
Mommy.
It's
okay.
I
know
you,
Mel.
You
won't
be
happy
Today
I
will.
I
can't
get

I
don't
want
to
think
about
if
I
don't
have
VINCENT:
All
right,
then.
I'll
give
it
a
try.
Thanks.

JACK:
Now,
while
you
need
to
think
of
'cause
the
rest
-
MAGGIE:
I
already
know,
Daddy.
I
wanna
go
to
the
zoo,
and
to
the
carousel
and
to
the
Natural
Museum
of
History,
and
visit
The
Cats...
No,
it's
Cats.
Not
The
Cats.
-
Hi,
Jack.
-
Mine,
oh
mine
Hi,
Jack.
I
never
knew
Yeah.
She's
so
cute.
She'll
grow
out
of
it.
Why
are
all
the
girls
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
won't
tell
you
why.
-
Hi,
Jack.
Did
you
see
what
she
just
did?
I'm
doing
a
story
What's
the
hook?
Oh,
just
a
little
expression
"Love
your
guy
like
a
little
boy
"and
he'll
grow
into
a
man."

Jack!
Get
in
here!
Arggh.
Huh
huh
huh
huh.
JACK:
Fish.
You're
not
going
to
believe
What's
wrong?
You
back
on
that
diet
again?
Honey,
you
remember
Lew.
LEW:
We
haven't
seen
each
I
am
cranky,
Jack.
And
I
ate
a
very
good
breakfast
We're
in
big
trouble
Oh,
God.
Come
here,
honey.
It's
okay.
Now,
this
is
Lois
Lane.
She
lives
here
in
the
newsroom.
Wow!
Want
to
pet
her,
sweetheart?
She
won't
bite.
You
got
this
raging
scoop
disease,
Which
is
what

Why
don't
you
stay
here
Me
and
your
daddy
gonna
-
Yeah.
-
Let's
go.
Would
you
rather
I'd
rather
you
were
right.
I
am
right.
Okay.
Who
told
you
were
taking
illegal
contributions
Manny
Feldstein.
Manny
Feldstein
told
you,
that
the
Newark-based
trucking
company
of
Grace
&
Marr,
has
made
an
illegal
contribution
to
Mayor
Aikens
re-election
campaign.
That's
right.
In
exchange
for
receiving
On
the
record.
Which
were
awarded
without
bidding.
-
Through
Grace
&
Marr.
Manny
Feldstein's
going
to
say
he
never
talked
to
you!
What?
What?
Hey.
During
the
mayor's
Manny
Feldstein's
going
to
say
You
didn't
make
it
up,
Of
course
not,
Lew.
Manny
told
me
There
was
$250,000...
Where's
Metro?
Deposited
in
unnumbered
accounts.
-
Freddy,
here.
We
may
have
to
print
-
Of
what?
You're
going
to
give
me
an
ulcer.
It's
like
I
swallowed
Why
couldn't
you
get
2
sources?
Remember
the
Cardinal
O'Brien
story?
Know
how
close
we
came
I
almost
got
the
Pulitzer
prize.

LEW:
It's
real
simple,
Jack.
Management
doesn't
want
Not
now!
I'm
a
good
reporter,
Lew.
No.
You
are
a
great
reporter,
but
sometimes
you
and
then
you
get
me
And
now
I've
given
you
And,
Jack,
nobody
almost

WOMAN:
Jack...
They're
not
going
to
fire
me.
My
pictures
are
on
buses.
LEW:
That's
what
I
said.

have
lunch
with
Frank
Burroughs.
Um,
Dad...
Frank
Burroughs?
"Frankly
Speaking"
is
Hey,
Dad?
Frank
Burroughs
is
a
pompous,
arrogant,
Who's
won
the
Pulitzer
prize.
You
know
something,
Lew?
I'm
not
going
to
lose
I
got
alimony
and
shrink
bills,
-
I
got
college
loans
to
repay...
One
second.
Now,
Manny
has
been
my
guy
One
second,
darling.
I
played
bridge
I
took
his
niece
Just
one
second.
I
had
to
sit
through
in
dinner
theater,
Jack,
I
gave
you
this
column,
and
I
love
you
like
a
son,
but
I
can't
cover
for
you
anymore.
Now,
you've
got
to
that
press
conference
We've
gotta
get
Feldstein
or
find
another
reliable
source
to
confirm
this
whole
goddamn
thing.
Otherwise,
we're
printing
a
retraction.
And
I
guarantee
you,
Jack,
Fine.
If
you
need
me,
I'm
at
a
different
LEW:
Now
where
you
going?
To
find
Manny.
LEW:
Take
care
of
yourself,
kid.
Oh,
I
will.
-
Hi.
Jack?
Listen,
um...
I
really
wanted
Go
ahead.
I've
noticed
that
you
haven't
dated
Right.
Actually,
we've
all
noticed.

Hey,
there
we
go.
-
Hi.
I
know
that
you're
sensitive,
but
frightened.
I'm
gentle,

but
brutal.
Think
about
it.
Think
about
me,
Jack.

I
will.
Okay.
Yeah.
Brutal.



Um...
Uh-uh-uh-uh...
Marla?
Have
you
seen
Maggie?
Uh,
no.
No?
Have
you
seen
my
daughter?
No?
Uh,
Maggie?
Aw,
damn
it!
-
Hey,
Jack...
Hi,
Daddy.
"Hi,
Daddy?"
Do
you
do
this
this
wandering-off
thing?
-
Yeah.
Listen,
I
gotta
go
talk
It's
kind
of
tricky,
and
I
only
have
one
shot
at
it,
-
That
I
can't
come?
Now,
what
am
I
going
Look,
this
is
incredibly
but
you're
the
last
person
I'm
really
in
a
bind.
I
know
you're
recording,
but...
I
know
you're
recording,

From
2:00
to
3:00.
Come
on,
Eddie,
Fine.
Never
mind.
Are
you
at
least
6:00.
-
It
would
mean
a
lot
to
him.
-
Mel!
Sammy,
get
off
of
that!
Get
off
of
it.
Get...
What
is
the
matter
with
you?
You
almost
broke
it
again.
Why
can't
you
just
play
quietly
and
not
get
into
trouble
Don't
you
realize
That's
it.
I
don't
wanna
go
there,
Mommy.
Too
bad.
-
Those
kids
will
beat
me...
Yes,
they
will...
You'll
have
to
be
Vincent,
I'll
be
back
in
an
hour
Now,
when
the
little
hand
gets
-
that's
4:30.
You're
not
being
punished.
and
then
we
can
go
But
that's
too
long.
I
set
the
alarm
and
I'll
be
here
I
promise.
Come
on.
But
I
don't
wanna
go
But
it'll
be
fun.
Look!
Hey!
Spider-Man!
BOY:
He
can't
come
in
here.
He's
not
a
superhero!
Oh,
yeah?
He
doesn't
look
like
one.
He
looks
like
a
poo-poo
crybaby.
When
the
big
hand
gets
to,
uh...
There...
There...
Then...
-
You'll
be
back.
Wait
a
minute...
Easy,
isn't
it?
Hang
on.

Now

Look!
Honey...

Hi,
Sammy.

your

Well,

If
you
can't

me,
JACK:
Just

My
eyes
were

Bye!
Thanks
for
doing
that.
Sure.
It

Maybe
she

hoping
I
can't
stand
people
who
blame
their

It's
so
nineties.
Man,
what
are
you
You're
blaming
your

What
Peter

You

That's
because
of

Yes,
there
is,
and
you
have
it.
Here's
your
phone
back.
Here's
yours.

Thank
you!
Man.
JACK:
Manny!
Hey.
Feldstein.
I
can't
be
with
you
Manny.
Excuse
me.
Manny!

Hey,
Manny.
Arggh!
Manny!


-
Hey,
Manny.
I'm
not
going
to
hit
you.
I've
been
having
thoughts.
We
already
had
our
thoughts.
Please
don't
yell
at
me.
You
were
the
one
who
said
to
me
this
garbage
thing
stinks.
Now,
I've
waited
for
a
month
for
you
to
get
comfortable
You
get
comfortable,
we
print
the
story,
it
runs
on
the
front
page,
and
now
you
are
telling
me
that
you
are
having
thoughts.
What
is
the
matter
with
you?
I've
been
having
trouble
You
get
the
dosage
wrong,
you
get
a
little
grandiose.
We
were
talking
about
taking
down
the
mayor
and
Yes,
that's
right.
That's
crazy.
No,
it's
not.
It
is.
I
realize
they
definitely
Manny,
come
here.

Don't
do
this
to
me,
all
right?
Look
at
me.
Hey.
I'm
the
one
who
started
for
If
I
Were
a
Rich
Man,

-
I
can't
do
it.
You're
my
guy.
I
got
a
wife
and
a
family.
I'm
their
guy,
too.
You're
hurting
my
neck.
Yeah.
All
right.
I'm
sorry,
Jack.
Well,
give
me
the...
I
can't
think
of
any
names.
Think.
I
don't
know.
Okay.
Who
set
up
the
account?
-
I
don't...
Who
set
up
the
account?
I
don't
know.
Maybe
Eddie
McCoy.
You
know
what?
Okay,
Manny?
Thanks.
Thank
you.


Hello?
Mommy...
What
happened?
I
don't
wanna
and
neither
does
Maggie.
Sweetie,
you're
gonna

Just
for
a
little
while...
What
happened?
Spider-Man
kicked
me
and
Sheryl
took
Maggie's
snack.
Let
me
talk
to
the
teacher.
He's
outside
talking
to
the
Hulk
about
not
using
the
"f"
word.
Sammy,
you
have
What's
L.S.D.?
L.S.D.?
Spider-Man
was
talking
to
Maggie
about
L.S.D.
that
Stay
right
where
you
are.
You
will
both
be
picked
up


No.
Manny's
a
dead
end.
Did
he
give
you
anything?
Eddie
McCoy.
He's
the
campaign
manager.
He
wouldn't
implicate
himself.
Uh,
city
comptroller.
LEW:
He'll
never
talk.
The
sanitation
commissioner?
Lieberman?
Metro!
How
do
we
get
a
hold

Barbados.
The

In

Maybe
the

What?
LEW:
What's
Lieberman
He's
there
with
Which
leaves
his
very
angry
wife.
LEW:
Bingo!
I'm
in
the
lobby.
Hup.
Here
we
go.


Yeah?
Jack,
it's
Melanie
Parker.
We
have
a
major
problem
They're
okay,
-
They
have
to
be
picked
up
right
now.
-
Can
you
do
it?
I
would
definitely
jeopardize
my
entire
life
Well,
I
would
definitely
and
by
extension
my
entire
life
But
your
press
conference
My
presentation
is
at
2:00.
I've
got
to
see
this
lady
about
some
information
I
need.
Couldn't
you
do
that
-
Yeah.
I...
Is
there
anybody
else
I
wouldn't
be
asking
you
Yeah.
Look,
how
about
from,
say,
3:00
until
if
you'll
watch
them
both
You're
asking
me
for
help?
It
would
appear
that
way,
I'll
agree
if
you
say,
"Jack,
please
be
my
knight
Jack,
don't
be
a
shithead.
This
is
hard
for
you,
isn't
it?
Are
you
agreeing
or
not?
You
know,
you're
not
I've
got
a
day,
too.
Sorry.

my
office
lobby
at
Fine.
Marla,
tell
Celia
to
get
Elaine
Lieberman's
and
call
me
on
my
cell
phone.
No,
uh...

What?
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
Sammy
is
allergic
and,
also,
he's
not
allowed
and
no
matter
what
he
says,
he
has
to
hold
your
hand
Oh,
and,
also,
I
like
to
check
the
sandbox
first.
You
never
know
And
also,
uh...
Okay.
Bye.
Fine.
One
fine
day
You'll
look
at
me
And
then
you'll
know
our
love
was
Meant
to
be
One
fine
day
You're
gonna
want
me
for
your
girl
The
arms
I
long
for
Will
open
wide
And
you'll
be
proud
to
have
me
Right
by
your
side

-
JACK:
Hello.
Me
who?
-
You
have
the
kids?
You
didn't
pick
up
the
kids?
Aah!
Hi!
Oh,
you
mean
those
kids.
Look,
I
was
just
calling...
You
just
wanted
to
call
because
you
don't
really
trust
me.
Sammy!
Sammy,
no.
And
you
only
asked
me
out
of
sheer
desperation.
Part
of
you
would
feel
safer
with
him
at
the
9th
Street
Isn't
that
true?
No,
that
is
not
true.
that
Sammy
can
get
into
trouble
faster
than
you
can
Are
you
flirting
with
me?
Would
you
please
just
really
pay
attention
to
him?
I
won't
let
him
Sammy!
It's
not
loaded.
Good-bye.
Sammy,
how
long
have
your
I
don't
know.
It
doesn't
matter,
really,
'cause
she
said
-
Yeah?
Hey,
what's
that?
That's
a
marble.
You
get
to
see
your
dad
a
lot?
Pretty
much,
usually.
He
has
a
different
schedule
He's
a
drummer.
His
favorite
thing
to
do
He's
probably
coming
today,
and
he's
taking
me
fishing
just
us,
-
Your
dad's
a
drummer,
huh?
-
Sounds
like
a
great
guy,
Sammy.
Kurt,
Jake,
-
Nice
to
see
you.
Nice
to
see
you.
Well,
voila.
I
love
this.
-
This
is...
What
is
that?
A
vaulted
pediment.
-
I
love
that.
But
I
need
to
see
this
with
cars.
You
don't
need
cars,
Dad.
My
imagination?
I
have
to
see
it
with
the
cars.
Cars.
Ahem.
See?
She's
quite
a
little
discovery.
Yes,
she
is.
Why
don't
you
join
us
-
Oh.
I...
Oh.
I
don't
know
if
I
can.
We'll
talk
about
this
project.
From
what
I've
seen,
you
could
bring
I'll
be
there.
Terrific.
That's
great.
Hi.
This
is
Jack
Taylor
-
I'm
looking
for
Elaine
Lieberman...
-
Am
not.
Yeah?
Who's
that
man
on
the
bus?
-
What?
Who's
what?
It
says,
"Frankly
Speaking."

You're

Yes,
I
will.
You're
gonna
be
fine.
The
doctor's
just
gonna
right
out
of
there.
How
come
you
couldn't
do
it?
Well,
you
know,
that's
a
little
nose,
But,
see,
the
doctor,
he's
gonna
have
this
clamp
thing
that's
gonna
come
up
and
and
you
are
gonna
be
fine.
You've
just
gotta
and
you've
gotta
You've
gotta
think
You've
gotta
think
about...
Hello,
Sammy.


Hello?
Hi,
sexy,
I
miss
you.
Look,
whoever
you
are,
this
isn't
Jack's
phone
anymore.
-
Who
are
you?
No.
Who
are
you?
This
is
Celia.
and
who's
this?
Absolutely
nobody.
Whatever.
that
Kristen
just
-
to
let
him
know
her
number
there?
And
this
is
very
important.
Elaine
Lieberman
will
only
be
at
Elizabeth
Arden's
until
3:30.
So
if
you
could
we'd
both
appreciate
it.
JACK:
Your
mom
is
gonna
kill
me
if
I
don't
have
you
guys
by
3:15
on
the
dot.
SAMMY:
I
don't
think
she'll
kill
ya.
She's
not
like
that,
really.
She
isn't?
No.
She
just
acts
tough
and
mean
'cause
she'd
rather
What
does
that
mean?
She
just
says
it
a
lot
when
men
try
to
open
Yeah?
Whup!
Excuse
us!
Go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
-
Hi.
Hey,
hey.
Um,
your
friend,
uh,
Celia
called
to
tell
you...
Sammy!
It's
okay,
only
an
escalator.
That
Kristen
called
you
and
also
that
Elaine
Lew...
Lieberman.
...will
be
at
Elizabeth
Arden's
Great.
Thank
you
so
much
for
You
saved
my
life.
Was
he
any
trouble?
No.
Not
at
all.
Good.
So,
everything
worked
out
great.
I
was
sure
you
were
going
to
either
or
not
at
all.
Guess
what?
No.
I
realize
that.
No,
you
weren't,
but...
Guess
what?
I'm
not
like
-
Really?
You
probably
think
and
I'm
not
at
all.
Well,
I
mean,
I
do
like
things
the
way
I
like
them,
And,
anyway,
in
my
life,
I'm
the
only
one
who
ever
what
does
it
matter?
Maybe
you
should
let
somebody
help
you
out
Definitely
not.
I've
got
all
of
these
little
balls
and
if
somebody
else
I'd
drop
them
all.
But
you're
not
a
control
freak.
No.
I'm
a
single
working
mother.
Okay.
I
have
more
work
to
do
than
time
to
do
it.
So
before
you
and
I
lengthy
and
exhausting
thing,
I
have
a
career
to
save,
okay?
Do
you
have
any
instructions
No,
no.
I
don't
suppose
you
could
switch
your
thing
from
5:00
to,
say,
4:30?
Because
I
just
found
out
that
I
have
a
new
thing
at
5:30.
Can't
switch
my
thing.
I'll
switch
mine.
See
you
guys
-
Bye,
Dad!
Thanks
again,
Jack.
You're
welcome.
I
realize
it's
difficult,
what
with,
uh...
I
know
your
name,
Mel.
So
what
did
you
guys
Quit
kicking
me,
Maggie.
I
wasn't
going
to
say
About
what?
Nothing.
It's
a
secret.
We're
not
supposed
to
say.
Secret
about
what?
About
your
dad?
And
you,
too,
Mommy.
Me,
too?
Come
on,
you
guys.
Tell.
Secret
about
me
and
Jack.
Hmm.
Does
it
have
anything
What
do
you
mean?
You
know,
feelings,
or
hurt
or
happy
and
excited.
You
know,
Definitely
about
feelings,
then.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Hee
hee.
Switch.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry,
Mom.
That's
okay,
honey.
So,
what'd
you
get?
Frozen
hot
chocolate.
Mmm!
Yum.
You
like
chocolate?
I
love
chocolate.
Daddy
told
Dr.
Martin
this
morning
that
he's
got
deep
dark
chocolate
Really?
MAGGIE:
And
that
who
wasn't
afraid
I
think
I'm
beginning
Are
you
mad?
Not
really.
I
think
he
should
have
He
was
afraid
you'd
hate
him.
Of
course
I
wouldn't
hate
him.
Honestly,
that
is
so
silly.
Ha
ha
ha!
Uh,
you
don't
understand.
I
don't
interrupt
Mrs.
Lieberman
during
her
bikini
wax.
Now,
listen...
Don't
bother
with
the
cute
face.
I
have
five
sons.
You
make
eyes
at
me
like
that,
I
make
you
pot
roast.
Oh,
excuse
me.
Hello,
Mrs.
Keffner.
Good-bye,
Mrs.
Lieberman.
-
Next
week.
Down,
please.
Hey,
um,

Okay.

Hi.
Hi,

Hey,

Mrs.
Lieberman,
Elaine
Lieberman

here
Hey,
it's
okay.
Hi.
I'm
looking

She
just
left.
-
Jack!
-
Is
that
you?
-
It's
Rita!
Melanie's
mother.
Oh,
Rita.
Hey!
Do
you...
Sorry.
Do
you
believe
I
know.
with
your
grandson.
Yeah.
I'm
just
trying
to
catch
up
I
just
want
to
tell
you
one
thing
about
my
daughter,
and
it's
something
She
can
make
you
want
to
scream
like
you're
having
a
body
wax.
I
mean,
she's
that
frustrating.
Yeah.
Inside,
Jack,
she's
mush.
Mush.
So
you
scream
all
you
want,
but
just
don't
Okay.
All
right.
Okay,
bye-bye.
You're
adorable.
Ohhh.
Mrs.
Lieberman?
Yeah?
Okay.
Mrs.
Lieberman!
Jack
Taylor,
Daily
News!

MRS.
LIEBERMAN:
Get
in.
Oh,
all
right!
Listen,
hey,
hey.
I'm
glad
I
finally
found
you.
I
have
to
ask
you
kind
About
my
husband?
I
don't
know
how
much
you
know
about
his
business
affairs.
Are
you
referring
So
you
know
about
that?
-
It's
in
his
name.
I
have
the
deposit
slips.
Uh,
I
don't
suppose
-
Go
on
the
record?
Elaine
Lieberman.
L-I-e-b-e-r-m-a-n.
I
only
have
one
request.
Anything
at
all.
Fax
him
a
copy
in
Barbados.
All
right.

Hello?
Hi,
darling.
Mom,
thank
God.
I
have
to
have
drinks
or
I'll
be
fired,
and
I
have
absolutely
What
time
are
you
done
Sammy!
Put
that
down.
Honey,
you're
gonna
break
it.
You
only
think
about
work.
What
about
your
personal
life?
Actually,
Mom,
today
I
thought
a
lot
Don't
laugh.
I
did.
Come
here,
kitty,
kitty-kitty.


-
Kitty?
Kitty.
Kitty?
What
do
you
mean,
I
don't
think
my
usual
self
since
I'm
pretty
sure
he
has
feelings
for
me.
He
wants
to
ask
me
out
on
a
date.
Divine.
Maggie?
Take
that
out
of
your
nose.
What
is
the
matter
with
you?
Excuse
me.
I'm...
The
thing
is
I'm...
I
think
I
could
have
or
at
least
I
think
which
is,
you
know,
it's
a
big
step
up
for
me.
Mom,
could
you
Maggie?
Well,
you
know,
I
had
no
idea
from
that
floating
head
that
he
was
so
tall,
and
he's
got
that
which
you
also
couldn't
tell
He
really
is
altogether
yummy,
Mel.
And
how
would
you
know?
Because
he
was
This
isn't
some
matchmaking
scheme,
is
it,
Mom?
Maggie!
Of
course
not,
darling.
Maggie!
Oh,
my
God.
-
You
lost
his
daughter?
Maggie!
Oh,
my
God!
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
She's
about
6
years
old,
Excuse
me,
sir.
-
Sorry.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
She's
about
6.
Maggie!
Have
you
seen
a
little
girl?
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.


Maggie!

Well,
hello.
Hi.
Is
there
anything
else
you
I
don't
think
so.
I
just...
He's
still
not
answering.
I
just
can't
One
minute
she
was
there,
-
I
understand
that,
but...
I
just
met
this
guy
and
I
was
horrible
to
him
all
day!
-
Excuse
me.
Jimmy,
get
her
a
coat!
Why
did
I
have
to
be
I
called
him
immature
and
I
was
my
usual
self.
She
said...
Excuse
me!
I'm
sorry.
She
said,
but
I
was
my
usual
self.
And
he
took
perfect
care
while
I
did
my
presentation,
which
went
very
well,
How
could
I
have
done
that?
It
probably
wasn't
your
fault.
And
I
didn't
even
pay
my
bill
Do
you
mind?
Is
that
your
mom?


Mrs.
Lieberman,
Elaine,
Ha
ha
ha!
Again.
That
was
smart.
-
Jack.
I
love
you,
Lew!
I
love
this
town.
I
love
this
job.
I
love
Elaine
Lieberman.
That's
a
lot
of
love
I
got
to
tell
you
something.
I
met
someone
today.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
don't
know
how
to
describe
her.
She's...
She's
luminous.
Her
face
is...
You're
talking
about
women.
Yeah.
Your
ass
is
on
the
line,
-
Are
you
nuts?
I
have
Elaine
Lieberman
and
she
has
proof
Elaine
Lieberman's
an
angry
wife.
All
her
husband's
got
to
do
and
she's
off
the
record.
You
have
my
word.
Your
word
means
nothing
You
better
make
sure
gets
to
that
press
conference
Either
she
confronts
or
I'm
going
to
have
Don't
worry.
I
hope
so,
Jack.
-
Jack?
I
just
had
lunch
Very
bright.
Very
funny.
Very
humble
man.
You
love
me,
Lew.

Come
on,
Lois,
come
on.
Hey,
Lew!
Lew,
where's
Jack?
On
the
way
to
city
hall.
But
I
have
a
ton

I
can't
sit
here
like
this.
I
got
to
go
find
Jack.
He's
going
to
be
at
city
hall
in
15
minutes.
5:00.
That's
great.
Hang
on!
Yes,
Elaine?
City
hall,
please.
Look,
I
can't
thank
you
enough.
Uh,
Dwayne.
Please,
city
hall.
Look,
I'll
do
my
best
I
was
just
on
my
way
so
I
might
be
All
right?


Hello.
Mr.
Taylor?
We
found
your
daughter.
What?
Excuse
me.
You
haven't
seen
No,
I
haven't.
Excuse
me?
to
know
Jack
Taylor,
do
you?
Very
well,
in
fact.
You're
Celia,
aren't
you?
Yes,
and
you
must
be
the
one
-
Hello,
Maggie!
-
Hey,
hi!
Hi,
I'm
Jack
Taylor.
Thank
you
very
much
Well,
it
was
my
pleasure.
I'm
sure
it
was.
We
got
to
hurry.
Come
on.
No,
Daddy.
There's
no
time
We
got
to
go
Hi,
kitties.
Tag.
You're
it.
No,
Daddy.
Red
light,
green
light.
Stop
it!
Come
on.
Let's
go.
If
I
don't
get
there...
No,
stop
it!
Do
you
want
me
to
lose
my
job?


You
really
love
Yeah.

Come
on.
There.
Okay.
So
what

'cause
he
looks
like
a
bobcat.
And
that
one's
Fred.
And
that
one's...
Well,
okay.
I
know
this
has
been
I
know
that
right
now
all
you
want
to
do
is
I
don't
blame
you,

But
if
I
don't
get
to
I'm
going
to
lose
my
job.
I
don't
want
to
lose
my
job.
So
we
got
to
work
Some
kind
of
a
deal
here,
so...
What
if
we
talk
to
and
we
ask
her
to
the
press
conference
with
us?
You
mean
keep
him?
Borrow
him.
But
I
want
to
keep
him.
You'll
have
to
talk
to
She's
allergic.
That's
right.
All
right.
Um...
Well,
you
know
what?
Bob
can
just
stay
at
my
house.
Where
would
he
sleep?
You
know
that
room
We
could
clear
those
out.
That's
a
good
idea.
Of
course,
you
know,
and
visit
every
once
in
a
while
just
to
check
up
and
make
sure
that
I'm
feeding
him
I
will.
Yeah.
Come
here.

You
know,
maybe
is
put
a
bed
in
Yeah.
'Cause
he
might
get
lonely.
He's
not
going
to
get

Well,
let
me
take
So
this
is
going
Bob.

All
right.

Mr.
Mayor!
Mr.
Burroughs.
Mr.
Mayor,
do
you
plan
and
the
Daily
News
for
the
apparently
false
and
certainly
they've
made
against
you?
Say,
that's
not
a
bad
idea.
Hey,
Dad,
Would
you
hurry,
please?
He
has
a
bigger
Do
you
speak
English?
MAYOR:
Last
question,
please.
Excuse
me!
Excuse
me.
Last
question,
please.
Mr.
Mayor!
Mom,
what
are
you
doing?
I
got
to
do
something.
-
Mr.
Mayor!
What
are
you
going
to
say?
I
don't
know.
Uh,
yes.
You,
on
the
right.
I...
What
about
Elaine...
-
Lieberman.
What
about
her?
She's
the
wife
of
She's
got
nothing
to
do
with
this.
What
paper
are
you
with,
Uh,
I...
I...
I
believe
Elaine
Lieberman
has
spoken
to
Jack
Taylor
and
can
back
up
Jack
Taylor
is
a
reckless
man
with
a
gift
Uh,
I
know
Jack
Taylor,
sir,
and...
and...
and
he
is
pretty
and
he
does
seem
to
have
somewhat
of
a
cavalier
attitude,
but
at
least
he's
honest.
I
don't
know
what
relationship
but
it's
quite
clear
you
know
nothing
about
politics
and
nothing
about
journalism.
That's
it.
Thank
you.
ALL:
Mr.
Mayor!

MAGGIE:
Melanie!
Look,
Melanie.
His
name's
Bob
Mr.
Mayor!
Jack,
Elaine
Lieberman
didn't
show
up.
I
know
that.
No,
no,
no,
Mr.
Taylor.
Mr.
Mayor,
you
may
be
able
That's
tough
to
do.
And
you
may
be
able
into
printing
a
retraction...
But
you
and
I
both
know
-
don't
we?
You
and
your
little
friend
just
pitiful!
What
is
pitiful,
Mr.
Mayor,
is
that
if
I
had
Elaine
Lieberman
would
be
here
with
a
canceled
check
from
a
very
well-known
mob
front
made
out
to
your
re-election
campaign.
That's
a
blatant
fabrication,
We
both
know
that
no
such
You
know
something?
There
would
be
no
check,
but
there
would
be
a
deposit
slip,
wouldn't
there,
Elaine?
Come
here.
Hello,
Sidney.
JACK:
All
right.
This
is
dated
March
15th
It
is
a
deposit
slip
for
$250,000.
That
same
day,
into
your
campaign
account
for
$250,000,
but
I
guess
that
was
The
press
conference
is
over!
I
said
over!
Mrs.
Lieberman,
Elaine,
what
can
I
say?
It
was
my
pleasure.
All
right.
Jack,
could
I
see
that
document?
In
the
paper
tomorrow,
You
guys
want
to
go
-
SAMMY:
Yeah.
Does
your
husband
know
My
husband.
He's
in
Barbados.
That
was
an
excellent
moment
-
Congratulations.
Mommy,
can
we
go
-
Yes,
sweetheart.
I
really
am
so
sorry
I
don't
even
want
to
think
I
don't
want
to
think
When
I
do
think
about
it,
I
can't
believe
that
and
dander
warnings,
You
even
laughed
in
my
face
-
when
I
showed
up
at
your
office
on
time.
And
then
you
lost
my
daughter.
I
know.
I
could've
ever
done.
So
someone
else
is
-
aren't
they?
I
would
like
to
hear
you
say
that,
say
it
for
your
kind.
My
kind?
The
ones
with
all
the
balls
That's
the
least
you
could
do.
Of
course
I'll
say
it,
Jack.
I
was
the
irresponsible
one.
-
Great.
Now
say
Why?
Because
with
one
sentence
you'll
restore
my
faith
Of
course
I'll
say
it
We're
never
going
You
can't
say
it.
Sure,
I
can,
that
it
won't
be
true.
I'm
waiting.
Okay.
I
can't
do
There.
Great.
Even
though
my
daily
activities
immediately
contradict
Oh,
unbelievable!
You
made
me
grovel
for
no
reason.
You
groveled
for
great
reason.
You
are
an
arrogant
ball
juggler,
baby.
First
of
all,
Secondly,
if
you
don't
don't
throw
them
in
my
face.
I
threw
them
in
your
face?
Yes,
you
did,
when
you
thrust
as
some
sort
of
lame
excuse
for
my
son
missing
his
field
trip.
Balls
in
my
face.
Ho
ho
ho!
can't
possibly
concentrate
like
picking
up
the
phone
to
say,
"Thanks
anyway,
"to
take
my
daughter
That's
not
quite
how
it
happened.
You
have
to
ask
is
one
of
your
many
girlfriends
if
she's
wearing
her
panties
as
loud
as
you
can.
And
now
in
the
midst
you
make
me
grovel?
First
of
all...
First
of
all,
I
thrust
my
column
in
your
face
because
I
thought
that
I've
ever
seen
and
I
want...
I
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression.
Now,
I
forgot
to
because
I,
as
opposed
to
you,
am
not
used
to
doing
So
I
slipped
up
there.
As
for
the
panties,
that
remark
was
to
my
editor
Lew,
simply
to
piss
you
off.
MAGGIE:
Come
on,
Dad.
Can
we
go?
Hey.
We
got
the
cab.

I
think
my
dad
likes
your
mom.
Maybe
my
mom
likes
him
back.
Men
like
you
have
made
me
the
woman
I
am.
All
the
women
I
know
like
you
have
made
me
think
Oh,
my
God.
I've
got
a
meeting,
5:25.
You're
never
Mom,
it's
the
last
game
It's
for
the
championship,
Mom,
and
the
coach
said
or
they
don't
get
a
trophy.
Even
the
losers
get
a
trophy,
but
you
don't
get
a
trophy
It's
on
the
way.
Let
go
of
it.
I
can't
let
go
of
it.
MELANIE:
Could
we
go
21
West
52nd
Street,
and
don't
try
to
take
14th
You
can't
make
a
left
I...I...
I
know
I
can
do
this.
No,
don't
take
Broadway.
It's
bound
to
be
a
mess.
Try
6th
Avenue,
but
not
until
after
23rd
because
of
the
construction.
JACK:
French-fried
eyeballs
MAGGIE:
Snot.
JACK:
Here
we
go.
Uh,
why
don't
you
hold
the
cab,
and
if
I'm
not
just
go
on
ahead
without
me.
You're
going
to
take
longer
I
can
do
this.
Mommy,
what
if
you
don't
come
and
Daddy
doesn't
come?
Oh,
sweetheart,
You
are
the
most
in
the
entire
world.
Your
job
is.
No,
you
are,
but
I
have
to
do
this
now.
Sammy,
I
know
I've
and
left
you
places,
and
I've
been
but
it's
going
I
promise
I
won't
take
in
there,
okay?
Okay?
Huh?
Hey,
Sammy,
come
here.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Let's
get
you
ready
for
soccer.
Grab
me
that
bag.
Hello.
Hi.
I
see
my
party.
MR.
LELAND:
Oh,
here
she
is.
I'm
glad
you
could
make
it.
Oh,
I'll
just
have
some
water.
Nonsense.
You
have
some
catching
up
to
do.
MR.
LELAND:
She'll
have
a
dry
Hey,
what
are
you
I
hope
my
daddy
can
come
Yeah.

Mommy
hopes
he
can
come,
too.
Last
night...
Last
night
my
mom
thought
I
was
asleep,
but
I
really
wasn't
and
I
heard
her
say
"Please
let
Eddie
come.
"Please
let
Eddie
come."

Eddie?
Eddie's
my
dad.
I
hope
he
comes,
too,
We
were
just
discussing
plans
for
a
sort
of
upscale
amusement
complex
for
adults.
You
know,
with
food
No
rides,
Dad.
After
drinks,
we
wanted
to
take
SON:
We
were
hoping
at
a
kind
of
a
bad
version
But
before
we
head
out,
Melanie,
maybe
you
could
toss
out
a
few
ideas,
Uh...
Well,
uh,
adult
amusement
complexes,
have
been
somewhat
cheesy,
usually
attached
What
I'm
thinking
of
a
bit
more
exciting.
YATES
SR.:
Hmm.
A
drawing
might
help,
Uh...
I...
YATES
JR.:
I
love
drawings.
I
don't
have
a...
Oh.
Here
you
go.
Oh,
okay.
Um...
Um,
let's
see.
Uh,
something
like...
Uh...
Um...
Isn't
that
the
little
lost
boy
from
this
morning?
What?
Uh,
with,
you
know...
Um...
You
know,
I
can't
do
this
now.
And
I
can't
go
with
you
Yes,
Mr.
Leland,
from
this
morning,
He's
my
son.
I
have
a
child
and
he
has
a
soccer
game
If
he's
late,
And
because
I'm
in
here
with
you,
he's
probably
going
to
be
late,
but
what
gets
to
me
is
instead
of
crying
about
it,
he's
out
there
blowing
fish
faces
at
us.
Gentlemen,
if
you're
smart,
for
my
dedication
and
ability
as
for
the
fact
that
I
am
going
and
I
am
going
to
run
so
that
my
kid
knows
that
is
him.
And,
Mr.
Leland,
should
be
if
I
were
I
like
her.
A
lot.
Well,
I
probably
lost
my
job,
but
at
least
we
still
have
10
minutes
to
get
to
the
game.
Hey,
short
cut!
In
spite
of
everything,
Jack,
I
want
you
to
know
that
for
losing
Maggie.
That's
all
right.
You
lost
Maggie
this
morning?
Yeah,
she
wandered
off
It
might've
been
helpful
if
you'd
mentioned
It
might've
been
helpful...
If
you
had
mentioned
to
stick
things
up
his
nose.
He
didn't!
Oh,
yeah.
Way
up
there.
In
fact,
I
had
to
use
It's
called
an
alligator,
a
tool
I
have
come
to
know
well.
Okay!
Here
we
go.
See?
I
told
you
Any
other
catastrophes?
MAGGIE:
Lois
Lane
ate
Why
does
that
not
surprise
me?
Sorry,
Sammy.
Lois
Lane?
Come
on.
I
got
to
go
to
the
bathroom.
I'll
take
you.
Why
don't
I
take
her?
So,
Maggie,
from
your
dad's
office?
Yeah.

Is
she
your
daddy's
girlfriend?
No
way.
She
wants
to
be,
but
she
isn't.
He
wants
somebody
and
Celia's
not
the
type.
Here.
I'll
get
There's
no
king
Playing
the
same
rules

In
a
heartbeat
Through
the
darkest
hours
When
all
is
said
and
done
It
has
to
come
Whoa-ho
You
go
from
lonely
to
the
lucky
one
'Cause
love's
funny
that
way
No
matter
who
you
are
Oh,
it
can
shake
your
faith
Or
it
can
break
your
heart
Yeah,
yeah
Once
in
a
while
We
are
lost
Yeah,
yeah.
It's
my
cat.

So
maybe
you
and
Maggie
for
some
dinner
after
the
game.
We
could
order
out
or
something.

Oh,
thank
God.
Dad!
Oh.
-
So
what
do
you
say?
Uh,
I
don't
think
so.
Okay.
Yeah,
...little
tired
myself.
So
I
guess
I
should
go
over
I
usually
watch
the
game
That's
where
Okay.
-
It
was
a
good
day.
Okay.

All
right,
come
here.
What?
You
can't
even
look
at
me?
This
is
the
second
game
Look,
I'm
here,
aren't
I?
Daddy!
Are
you
staying
-
Are
you?
Cool.
I'm
gonna
play
my
best.
You
watch,
my
really
best.

Go
get
'em,
tiger.
Come
on.
Here,
Dad.
BOY:
Marco.
Marco,
pass.
Marco.
Marco!
Hey,
Dad!
Part
of
the
reason
was
to
tell
Sammy
in
person
that
I'm
not
gonna
our
fishing
trip
this
summer.
You
can't
do
this
I
got
a
gig
Can't
you
see
Come
on,
Mel.
COACH:
Get
it.
Get
it.
Mom!
Hey,
Mom,
look!
Yes.

Let's
go,
Maggie.
Maggie,
come
on.
Down
the
alley.
Let's
go.
Watch
him.
Bodycheck
him,
Maggie.
But
that
would
be
rude,
Daddy.
That's
not
rude.
There
you
go.

Hey!
Hey!
What's
with
that
guy?
Get
that
kid!

Good
game
there,
Sammy.
Thanks,
Jack.
I'll
see
you.
Thanks
for
everything.
You,
too.
Okay,
you
ready?
Okay,
hang
on.
You
were
great.
So
I'll
see
you
Okay.
Bye,
Mel.
Bye.
Hey,
let's
get
Okay.
Let
me
see
your
trophy.
Wow!
You
think
that's
real
gold?
Yeah.
You

ball.

Okay,

ready?

No.

Hi.
Maggie
insisted
some

Thank
you.
Um...
Do
you

Do
you
want
to
come
in
No.
We
don't
Oh.
Okay.

-
Yes...
Here
they
are.
Heh

Okay.
Okay.
Thank
you.
Come
on,
Dad.
Uh...
Come
in.
Please.
Okay.
A
few
minutes.
Hi,
Jack.
Sammy.
Hi.
Unh.
Unh.
What
do
you
weigh?
Wanna
come
see
my
room?
MAGGIE:
Okay.
Huh.
You're
investigating
my
apartment.
Not
as
neat
as
I
would've
thought.
It's
only
neat
when
my
mother
If
she
sees
it
like
this,
she
shakes
her
head,
which
means
she's
unhappy
And
then
she
lets
out
she
would've
rather
have
gone

-
Um...
You
guys
wanna
watch
a
video?
MAGGIE
AND
SAMMY:
Yeah!
How
about
The
Wizard
of
Oz?
Yeah!
You
can
get
all
and
watch
for
a
little
while.
I
wanna
watch
It's
too
late.
You
can
watch
for
as
long
one
cup
of
coffee.
Two
cups
of
coffee.
We'll
see.

It's
always
such
a
dilemma

After
Sammy's
dad
and
I
I
put
up
pictures
of
him
I
guess
I
wanted
to
reassure
him
that
no
matter
what,
his
dad
would
still
You
want,
uh,
cream
or...
No,
that's
fine.
He
talked
about
him
I'm
sure
he
did.
Is
he
really
Yeah.
He's
touring
with
-
Really?
Springsteen?
Wow.
I'm
beating
around
the
bush
and
there's
something
Yes?
Why
did
you
spend
the
entire
day
were
thinking
about
getting
What?
I
spent
the
whole
day
You
were
flirting
with
me.
You
even
told
the
kids
I
never
told
them
that.
Yes,
you
did.
-
Heh
heh.
It
was
all
about
you
and
me
and
feelings.
You
were
going
to
ask
me
out.
Okay.
The
big
secret
was
about
stuck
up
his
nose,
and
I
never
once
even
thought
I
am
so
sure.
I
don't
know
why
You
said
you
thought
I
was
you'd
ever
seen.
-
That
was
a
line.
and
you
know
it.
You
wanted
me
ever
since
And
you
wanted
me
ever
since
the
9th
Street
when
you
saw
me
For
someone
who
is
so
totally
disinterested
you
sure
do
remember
You
remember
better
than
I
do.
-
I
do
not.
No,
I
don't.
What
would
you
do
You're
not
gonna
What
would
you
do
if
I
did?
Do
you
wanna
kiss
me
right
now?
I
wouldn't
have
mentioned
it
Fine.
You're
just
reeling
me
in,
aren't
you?
You're
like
Roy
Scheider
in
the
end
of
Jaws.
The
minute
I
open
my
mouth,
you're
gonna
drop
Then
you're
gonna
wear
around
your
neck.
So
you're
admitting
I
am
admitting
that
I
am
scared
of
getting
close
I'm
just
as
scared
as
you
are.

Don't
bite.
Hmm.
Mommy.
What?
Can
you
fast-forward
for
us?
That
mean
lady's
on,
Sweetheart,
you
know
The
remote's
broken.
-
And
she's
stealing
Toto.
There,
she's
gone.
Okay?
This
is
the
color
part.
-
Wait.
No.
Let's
do
this
right.
Let
me
go
in
and
freshen
up
so
I
feel
a
little
more
and
not
a
den
mommy.
Ok?
Um,
why
don't
you
go
in
and...
Go
sit
over
there,
and
close
your
eyes,
and
anticipate
my
return?
Okay.
Or
you
can
go
in
and
watch
and
wait
for
me
to
come
back.

Yeah,
okay.
