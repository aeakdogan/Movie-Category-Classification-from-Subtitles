should
control
its
destiny.
Uh,
the
salad
comes
That's
the
fork
I
knew.

Between
your
public
statements
and
the
we
find
it
very
hard
to
figure
out
what
I
don't
know
about
you,

You
know,
there
was
a
time
when
-
Men
like
my
grandfather

These
are

Try
it.

plan
to
do
Break

sure
you'll
understand
of
your
turning
40
years
of
my
work
At
the
price
I'm
paying
for
this
I'm
rich
enough.
I
just
want
Slippery
little
suckers.
It
happens
all
the
time.
I
met
your
father.
-
Carter.
He's
not
quite
the
bastard
-
No,
I
have
the
franchise
on
that.
I
doubt
it.
It
doesn't
Oh,
I
hadn't
heard.
I'm
sorry
too.
Mr.
Morse,
you
asked
for
this
meeting.
-
Leave
my
company
alone.
-
I'll
buy
your
stock
back.
We
will;
we're
getting
a
contract
There
will
be
no
contract.
-
And
it
will
remain
there.
You
got
dirty
politicians
in

Easy,
easy,
-
Mr.
Lewis
plays
hardball.
I've
heard
enough
of
this.
Vivian,
I'm
sorry,
Grandfather.
I'd
better
join
my
grandson.
I'm
sure
it'll
be
delicious.
Watch
out,
Lewis.
I
look
forward
to
it,
sir.
Rich
people
throw
their
napkins

lot,
He
seems
like
a
nice
man.
I
guess
$3,000
does
not
I
just
mean
it's
sweet
the
way
Oh,
his
grandson
thinks
he's
a
relic.

No,

It's

I
mean,
the
business
He's
in
trouble.
He
doesn't
want
Thanks
for
the
recap.
The
problem
is,
I
think
I'd
like
for
you
to
get
down
from
there;
It's
making
you
nervous
?
What
if
I
just
Would
you--
Would
you
Vivian,
I'm
serious.
It's
really
high.
Look,

hands,

The
truth
is,
it

I
will
not
let
myself
become
I
know.
"Don't
get
emotional
That's
why
no

It's
like
what
you're
saying:
When
I'm
with
a
guy,
I
mean...
except
with
you.
Oh,
of
course,
not
with
me.
You
and
I
are
such
similar
We

I
hadn't
spoken
to
him
I
wasn't

want
to
talk
about
this
?
Well,
I
tell
you
what,
Let's
watch
old
movies
all

?
Look,
I'll
tell
you
what.
I'll
be
back.

Where
are
you
going

change
the
subject,
Oh,
I
love
you,
Adam,
Alex,
Peter,
Oh,
I
love
you.

Hi,

Mean
to
you

I'll
tell
you
why.
So

think
I
got
something
in
the
car
Thank
you.
-
Vivian,
hi.
David
Morse.
-
David.
-
I'm
okay.
-
It's
new.
-
Edward's
date.
-
Okay,
hon
?
I'm
going
to
rip
off
all
Have
fun.
-
Come
meet
my
horse,
Vivian.
-He's
right
here.
I
didn't
know
Uh,
I
was
asking
for
directions.
Oh,
so
you
just
ran
into
her
?
So
anyway,
what
does
she
do
?
-
She's
in
sales.
What
does
she
sell
?
Why
do
you
want
to
know
?
Just
hear
me
out
on
this.
I
see
some
differences
in
you
this
week,
I'm
wondering
if
maybe
especially
when
I
see
her
-
I
introduced
them
at
dinner
Now
they're
best
friends
?
Now
she's
talking
to
a
guy
whose
-
Don't
be
ridiculous.
hasn't
attached
herself
to
you
-
This
happens
!
Industrial
espionage--
-
Phil,
listen
to
me.
-
She's
not
a
spy.
She
is
a
hooker.
She
is
a
hooker.
I
picked
her
up
In
your
car.
-

Oh,
you
are--
Oh,
man
!

You're
the
only
millionaire
who
goes
looking
for
a
bargain
basement
-
Edward
!
Senator.
Senator
Adams,
Thank
you.
I
hope
the
information
Oh,
absolutely,
yes,
and
thank
you
No,
it's
still
bogged
down.
-
Having
a
nice
time,
Vivian
?
Must
be
quite
a
change
What
?
Yeah,
Edward
told
me.
But
don't
worry;
Listen,
maybe,
uh,
you
and
I
could
after
Edward
leaves.
Yeah,
sure.
Why
not
?
We'll
just


I'd
like
to
mention
a
couple
Jacobs
Distributors,
and
we'd
like
to
give
a
great
big
thanks
-
Edward
Lewis
Enterprises.

-
You
all
right
?
Fine.
That's
good.
Could
I
have
Asshole
!
There's
a
word.
I
think
I
liked
"fine"
better.
You
know
what
?
Just
tell
me
one
thing:
Well,
for
one
thing,
No,
what
I
mean
is,
if
you
-
why
didn't
you
just
let
me
wear
I
mean,
in
my
own
clothes,
when
someone
I
can
handle
it;
I'm
very
sorry.
I'm
not
happy
with
But
he
is
my
attorney.
He
thought
you
were
some
kind
of
Are
you
my
pimp
now
?
You
think
you
-
I'm
not
some
little
toy
!
Vivian,
I'm
speaking
to
you.
I
hate
to
point
out
the
obvious,
-
And
you
are
my
employee
!
I
say
who;
I
say
when;
I
refuse
to
spend
the
next
That's
the
end
of
it
!
I'm
sorry
I
ever
met
you.
I'm
sorry
I
ever
As
if
you
had
so
many
more
I've
never
had
anyone
Somehow,
I
find
that
Where
are
you
going
?
I
want
my
money.
Come
on
!

I'm
sorry.
I
wasn't
prepared
It
was
stupid
and
cruel.
I
didn't
mean
it.
I
don't
want
you
to
go.
-
Will
you
stay
the
week
?
I
saw
you
talking
to
David
Morse;
We
were
just
talking.

-
I
didn't
like
it.
Down
?
You
hurt
me.
Yes.
Don't
do
it
again.
First
guy
I
ever
loved
Second
was
worse.
My
mom
called
me
If
there
was
a
bum
That's
how
I
ended
up
here.
Oh.
So
here
I
was:
no
money,

I
worked
at
a
couple
parked
cars
at
wrestling.
And
I
couldn't
make
the
rent.
That's
when
I
met
Kit.
She
was
a
hooker
So
one
day
I
did
it.
I
cried
the
whole
time.
But
then
I
got
some
regulars
It's
not
like
anybody
plans
this;
You
could
be
People
put
you
down
enough,
I
think
you
are
a
very
bright,
The
bad
stuff
You
ever
notice
that
?

Tell
him
I'll
call
him
on
Monday.

Where
you
going
?
Did
he
sign
these
?
-
Edward,
you
can't
disappear
now.
Morse
isn't
going
anywhere.
-
Did
you
send
the
tickets
-
Where
are
you
going
?
With
the
hooker
?
Be
careful,
Philip.
-
Do
I
look
okay
?
-
Mmm
?
Well,
nothin'
else
is
gonna
fit
Well,
maybe
I
don't
want
you
to
get
too
excited.

Oh
!
They
really
let
you
borrow
this
I'm
a
very
good
customer.
If
you
were
gonna
buy
this,
-
Quarter
of
a
million.
A
quarter
So,
where
we
goin'
?
It's
a
surprise.
If
I
forget
to
tell
you
later,

wide
variety
of
stores

Everything's

You
gonna
leave
some
money
by
the
bed
Vivian,
it
really
How
would
it
be
?
-
Well,
for
one
thing,
it
would


What
do
you
see
I
don't
know.
When
I
was
a
little
girl,
my
mama
used
to
lock
me
in
the
attic
And
I
would--
I
would
trapped
in
a
tower
And
then
suddenly
on
a
white
horse
with
these
And
I
would
wave.
And
he
would
climb
up
the
tower
But
never
in
all
the
time...
that
I
had
this
dream
"Come
on,
baby,
I'll
put
you
up

-
Yes.
I
just
got
off
the
phone
-
He
wants
to
meet
with
you
today.
He
wouldn't
say.
Edward,
I
think
we
We
got
him
!
Look,
if
he's
really
caving
in,
No,
it's
no
good.
If
he's
Have
Morse
meet
me
downtown
I
have
to
go
now,
but
I
want
you
to
understand...
I
heard
everything
you
said.
This
is
all
It's
a
very
big
step
for
me.
I
know.
It's
a
really
good
offer
I've
never
treated
you
You
just
did.
It's
Barnard
Thompson

Could

They
told
me
You
were
supposed
to
come
by
Tuesday.
-
I
was
hidin'
from
Carlos.
-
you
wouldn't
have
to
hide.
We
had
to
visit
him
in
the
hospital,
Anyway,
I
got
the
money.
You
know,
he
was
talkin'
He
would
bust
somethin'
I
was
afraid
to
hug
you
up
there.
-
You
look
really
good.
You
clean
up
real
nice.
You
sure
don't
fit
in
down
Well,
thanks,
but
it's
easy
Yeah.
-
So,
when
does
he
leave
?
-
You
get
to
keep
the
clothes
?
Edward
asked
me
But
I
think,
I
think
definitely
no.
-
"Definitely
no."
Oh,
no.
What
?
-
I
know
this
weepy
look
on
your
face.
-
You
fell
in
love
with
him.
-
You've
fallen
in
love
with
him
?
-
Did
you
kiss
him
?
On
the
mouth
?
-
You
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
?
You
fall
in
love
with
him,
Look,
I'm
not
stupid,
okay
?
I
just--
I
like
him.
You
like
him
?
-
Yeah.
Well,
he's
not
a
bum.
-
Who's
gonna
break
my
heart,
right
?
You
don't
know
that.
Maybe
you
guys
could,
like,
um,
Like,
buy
some
diamonds
Anyway,
it
could
work.
When
does
it
happen,
Kit
?
When
does
it
really
happen
?
Did
it
work
out
for
Skinny
Marie
Those
were
very
specific
cases
I
just
wanna
know
You
give
me
one
example
of
somebody
that
-
Name
someone
?
-
You
want
me
to
give
you
Oh,
God,
the
pressure

Cinder-fuckin'-rella.

If
you
do,
I'll
give
you
See,
l--
Not
quick
enough

Oh

Hah

Winner
gets
a
piggy-back.
Oh,
Zachary
!

Mr.
Morse,
you
said
this
morning
Mr.
Lewis
is
now
listening.
I've
reconsidered
my
position
on
one
condition.
I'm
not
so
concerned
about
me,
It's
not
a
problem.
Well,
then,
gentlemen.
-
If
you
look
at--

Gentlemen,
Thank
you.
All
right,
gentlemen,
you
heard
You
too,
Phil.

I
mean
I
would
like
to
speak
-
Why
does
he
get
to
stay
?
-
I'll
be
right
outside.
-
Is
that
better
?
-
Would
you
like
a
cup
of
coffee
?

my
interests
in
your
company
What
is
it
you're
after
now,
Well,
I
no
longer
wish
to
buy
But
I
don't
want
anyone
And
it
is
still
So
I
find
myself...
I
wanna
help
you.
Why
?
Mr.
Morse,
I
think
we
can
do
something
What
about
our
Navy
contracts
?
Ah,
they
weren't
dead.
Just
delayed.
-

You're
very
good
at
it.
It's
my
job.
I
think
we
can
leave
the
details
I
find
this
hard
to
say
I'm
proud
of
you.
Thank
you.
I
think
we
can
let
in
-

Come
in,
gentlemen.
Edward,
please,
It's
all
yours,
Phil.
Hold
it.
Hold
it.
These
aren't
signed
!

Mr.
Lewis
and
I
are
going
Great
big
ships.
You
know,
I
think
I'm
gonna
-
Just
stay
here
for
a
while.

Well,
well.
Hello
again.
Edward's
not
here.
No.
Uh,
Edward
is
definitely

No,
if
Edward
were
with
me--
When.
Actually,
when...
he
didn't
blow
off
I
think
that,
uh,
Edward's
with
you.
-
Mind
if
I
have
a
drink
?
No,
thank
you.
Well,
I'll
just
wait.
Uh,
Edward
will
be
back
soon.
You
know,
this
is
not
home.
This
is,
uh,
And,
uh,
you
are
not...
the
little
woman.
You're
a
hooker.
Maybe
you're
a
very
good
Maybe
if
I
do
you,
then
I
wouldn't
care
Because
I
have
to
be
Right
now,
Vivian,
right
now
And
right
now
Right
now
I
am
So
maybe
if
I
and
take
you
to
the
opera,
then
I
could
-
Hey,
get
off
me
!
-
Ow
!
-
Come
on
!
Come
on
!
I'll
pay
for
it.
-
How
much
is
it
?
-
Fifty
?
You
a
$50
whore,
Vivian
?
-
Get
off
!
You
already
did,
-
Out.
Out
of
here.
Look,
she's
a
whore,
man.
-
Aah
!
Damn.
-
I
think
you
broke
my
nose.
What
is
wrong
with
you
?
Come
on,
-
I
devoted
my
whole
life
to
you
!
This
is
such
bullshit
!
I
made
you
a
very
rich
man
Now
get
outta
here
!
Get
out
!
Why
do
guys
always
know
how
to
hit
Wham
!
And
it
feels
like
What
do
they
do
?
Do
they
Is
that--
Ow.
Not
all
guys
hit.
I
heard
about
-
That
was
a
business
decision.
It
felt
good.
I
think
this
is
okay.
I
gotta
get
going.
Yes,
I
noticed
you're
packed.
Why
are
you
leaving
now
?
Edward,
there'll
always
be
some
guy,
thinkin'
he
can
treat
me
thinking
that
it's
allowed.
What
are
you
gonna
do
?
That's
not
why
you're
leaving.
Look,
you
made
me
Look,
you
made
me
And
a
few
months
ago,
But
now
everything
is
different,
And
you
can't
change
back.
I
want
more.
I
know
about
wanting
more.
I
invented
the
concept.
The
question
is
how
much
more.
I
want
the
fairy
tale.
Impossible
relationships.
My
special
gift
is
-
Thank
you.
If
you
ever
need
anything--
dental

I
had
a
good
time.
Me
too.
Do
you
want
me

No,
I
got
it.
Thanks.
Stay.
Stay
the
night
with
me.
And
not
because
I'm
paying
you,

I
can't.
Good-bye.
I
think
you
have
Mmm.

didn't
do
it,
sir.
I
want
you
to
call
maintenance
-
Yes,
sir.
Miss
Vivian.
Thank
you.
I
wanted
to
say
good-bye.
Well,

gather
you're

you
arranged

been
a
pleasure

meet
you
downstairs,
sir.

you
gonna

used
to
