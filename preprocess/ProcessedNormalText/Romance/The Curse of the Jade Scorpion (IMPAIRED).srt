It's
just
what
I
thought
it
would
be--
Oh,
thank
you.
It's
the
effect
we
were
going
for.
You
dying
to
see
my,
If
it's
in
the
same
spot
it
was
this
This
is
truly
a
novelty
for
me.
I'm
used
to
pent
houses
and
yachts--
gorgeous
European
lovers
who
buy
me
And
yet,
somehow,
I
find
it
strangely
in
a
grungy
hovel
I
know
there's
a
compliment
in
there.
You
gonna
take
that
coat
off?
It
hasn't
rained
in
Oh,
well.
What
do
you
think?
If
I
happen
to
pass
away
just
have
the
embalmer
-

I'll
slip
into
something
a
little
more
More
comfortable
than
that?
What
are
-
Hello?
You
are
in
the
power
You
will
proceed
to
You
will
enter
and
open
the
safe.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
an
Indian
book
I'm
sorry,
Laura,
but
we're
going
to
-
Pardon
me?
I
hope
you
don't
mind.
-
I
had
a
wonderful
evening.
I'll
turn
around
and
you
can
get
-
I'm
rather
pressed
for
time.
Tonight
was
very
meaningful
to
me.
I'll
always
think
of
it
If
you're
in
the
neighborhood
again,
What's
come
over
you?
Should
you
want
any
peanuts
I
think
I
have
a
whole
dish
You
hate
women,
don't
you?
Not
at
all.
Actually,
Really.
A
very
pleasant
variation.
I
should
have
known.
A
mousy
little
clerk
like
you,
-
I
should
have
known.
Do
drop
in
again
in
the
springtime.
I'm
going!
I'm
getting
out!
I'm
not
used
to
getting
kicked
out
of
a
You're
very
sick,
you
know?
Thanking
you
in
advance
God
bless
you.
-
Mamma
mia.
I
can't
believe
it.
You
think
somebody
from
the
We
did
the
security
here.
Somebody's
a
step
ahead
of
ya.
I
want
to
speak
to
the
Dillworths.
The
Coopersmith
detectives
Geez.
You
mean--
She
convinced
Magruder
We
need
all
the
help
What's
happenin',
fellas?
Hey,
C.W.
Yeah?
Well,
this
is
my
case,
Will
you
listen
to
him?
-
Hey,
they
called
us.
Maybe
they
think
you're
slippin'.
-
You
know
my
brother
Joe?
I
hear
you're
havin'
-
So
you
guys
get
any
clues?
Yeah?
What?
I'll
let
you
know
if
they're
real
clues
We'd
like
to
make
this
collar.
It'd
mean
I
hear
they're
makin'
Fellas,
I'm
gonna
then
you
guys
are
gonna
be
back
at
your
We
had
to
laugh
when
we
heard
I
can
see
already
we're
gonna
-
One
of
us
is
gonna
fall
down.
You're
in
over
your
heads--
This
is
a
very
smart
burglar.
You
guys
have
trouble
figuring
out
I'll
tell
you
what
we
figure.
We're
looking
for
a
tall
man,
Belly
button
in
or
out?
Belly
button
in
or
out?

Now,
if
he's
short
too
fat
to
squeeze
Wanna
show
him
the
big
clue?
What's
the
big
clue?
The
guy
Show
him.
No
one
in
this
house
Hey--
I've
been
to
Rocky's
Bar.
You
got
a
matchbook.
Big
deal.
We're
gonna
nail
this
guy.
The
important
thing
is
that
you
Don't
worry.
I
don't.
What
are
you
so
upset
about?
Can
you
believe
she
talked
Magruder
You've
been
moping
around
all
day.
It's
not
like
you.
-
Al,
I
got
a
confession
to
make.
I
woke
up
this
morning.
I
found
-
Yeah,
so?
Come
on.
How
many
times
has
that
You
pick
up
a
broad.
You
knock
off
-
So
you
didn't
remember.
-
I
don't
drink
vodka.
Vodka
does
funny
things
to
a
person.
I've
gotten
up
with
some
pretty
I
can't
figure
it
out.
There's

I
wanted
That
I
remember
clearly.
This
was
about
9:00.
Hey,
wait
a
minute.
I
ran
into--
-
What
are
you
thinkin'?
No
wonder
I
thought
But
not
inside
with
the
Dillworths
-
It's
inside
our
company.
It's
so
obvious.
Are
you
kiddin'?
Who?
We're
the
only
ones
who
have
Yeah,
and
what
if
somebody
What
if
someone
because
she
hasn't
worked
here
-
Fitzgerald?
Why
not?
My
God.
She's
always
saying
she
can
I
don't
think
she
meant
stealing.
What
do
we
know
about
her?
You
know,
she
has
expensive
tastes.
-
I
gotta
get
into
her
office.
-
I
must
She'll
take
a
gun
and
shoot
you.
But
it
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world.
She
has
the
files--
She
knows
all
the
security
information.
Don't
rifle
her
desk.
-
Uh--
-
Me?
No,
I
was--

You're
all
red.
You
know,
only
a
suspicious,
paranoid
I
doubt
very
much
whether
or
Quakers
would
come
You
wormy
little
ferret.
Now
you're
mixing
metaphors,
-
I
know
why
you're
You're
looking
for
the
report
-
You
hired
them
to
give
me
a
hard
time.
That's
right.
Now
it's
too
many
cooks,
These
guys
have
made
more
progress
in
Were
you
crying?
Your
mascara--
Don't
try
to
tap-dance
your
way
I
wasn't
searching.
I
was
rummag--
Get
out.
If
I
ever
catch
you
-
What
are
you
afraid
I'll
find?
Watch
out,
'cause
I'm
on
to
you.
I
know
This
is
silly.
I
just
had
lunch,
and
you're
killing
you
instantly
or
Have
a
nice
day.
-
I
gotta
get
into
her
apartment.
-
She
hit
the
ceiling
'Cause
she's
guilty.
-
She's
got
pretty
eyes.
There's
something
wrong--
She
says
the
same
thing
about
you.
If
you
two
were
prize
fighters,
-
I
gotta
get
into
her
place.
Being
an
investigator
She
catches
you,
Has
that
ever
stopped
me
before?
-
She's
going
out
tonight.
'Cause
I
went
through
her
desk.
She's
meeting
her
sister
tonight
I
thought
she
said
her
sister
That's
what
I'm
tellin'
ya.
Yeah,
well,
you
know,
you
can't
break
I'm
not
gonna
break
in.
-
How
did
you
manage
that?
She's
gonna
know
something's
up
She'll
never
know.
I
made
a
duplicate.
My
God.
You
know,
you've
got
You
would
have
made
It
takes
one
to
catch
one.
-
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.


-
Can
I
take
your
coat,
honey?
Okay,
what
did
you
want
No
drink?
We've
had
enough
drinks.
-
You're
not
making
this
very
easy.
Because
we
care
about
each
other.
Before
it
was
you
loved
me.
-
Just
sit
down.
I
wish
you
wouldn't
You
rushed
me
out
of
because
you
were
afraid
I
was
You
are
a
highly
volatile
woman.
Am
I?
Most
men
complain
-
You
know
I
care
about
you.
-
It's
not
that
I
don't
want
I've
tried
to
work
up
All
those
promises?
Those
stories
-
You're
making
this
into
a
nightmare.
-
Try
to
understand.
-
We
can
even
continue
to
sleep
together.
I
only
got
involved
in
this
When
you
say
it
like
that,
-
Haven't
you?
I
respect
you
too
much.
Oh,
my
God.
How
did
we
go
from
love
Next
thing
you'll
be
-
Betty
Ann--
-
Betty--
-
Honey,
listen--
I
hope
you
decide
You're
really
helping
I
guess
we
won't
be
having
I
feel
like
such
a
jerk!
You
shouldn't.
It's
my
fault.
I
got
-
Honey--


Good-
bye,
Chris.
Miss
Fitzgerald!
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
You
what?
-
I'm
hiding
behind
your
screen.
You
have
this
nice
Japanese
screen.
How
did
you
get
in?
I--
What
time--
I've
been
here
-
You
broke
into
my
apartment?
-
How
did
you
get
in?
-
How
did
you
get
in
here?
-
You
what?
It's
good
to
have
two
keys,
'cause
-
Why
did
you
do
this
to
me?
Because
I'm
convinced
is
responsible
for
the
jewel
robbery.
-
Who,
me?
-
Based
on
what?
-
You
have
access
to
all
the
data.
But
you
were
so
nervous
the
other
night
I
came
up,
and
you
were
You
have
a
Rocky's
matchbook.
Remember
we
had
a
drink
at
Rocky's
Bar?
So
you
broke
into
my
apartment
illegally
I
wasn't
spying.
What's
wrong
with
you?
-
I'm
a
big
rummager.
I
was
rummaging
in
the
afternoon.
All
those
sisters-
all
those
dinners-
Oh,
God!
I'm
mortified!
Stop
it.
If
it
wasn't
for
me
being
here,
That's
none
of
your
business,
And
over
a
jerk
like
Magruder.
He's
not
a
jerk.
He's
wonderful.
Don't
you
see?
He
gives
you
these
-
He's
not
gonna
leave
his
wife.
The
only
humiliating
thing
You're
not
fit
to
discuss
Look
at
this.
She
still
loves
the
guy.
Get
out
before
I
call
the
police
I'm
not
letting
you
alone
here
tonight.
I'd
ask
if
you
had
any
friends,
-

What--

-
Are
you
okay?
-
Hello?

-

I'm
making
coffee.
Oh,
God!
You
came
here
last
night
because
This
happens
to
be
I'll
say
you're
confused.
-
Are
you
kidding?
Like
take
a
swan
dive
out
the
window.
How
do
you
know
I
wouldn't
take
-
Because
I
watched
over
you.
That's
exactly
right.
Yes.
And
you
snore
like
a
grizzly
bear
I
had
a
bad
moment
last
night.
-
You
talk
in
your
sleep.
-
Who's
Rita?
-
Anything
else?
Check
your
sex.
And
you
mentioned
my
name
too.
-
You
said
that
I
should
rot
in
hell.
I
figured
you
were
feeling
better.
Now,
if
you'll
go,
I
gotta
Nobody's
gonna
gossip.
I
couldn't
stand
you
when
I
met
you,
I
find
you
obnoxious
and
pompous--
When
you
see
me
in
the
office--
do
me
And
if
Magruder
tells
you
if
I
were
you,
Don't
choke
on
your
breakfast
You'll
wind
up
unable
to
Mr.
Magruder,
you
sent
for--
Oh.
If
you'll
all
open
Sit
down,
C.W.
Your
brother
looks
good.
I'll
let
the
Coopersmiths
After
careful
search,
using
some
of

found
some
interesting
clues.
Yeah?
Leading
to

We
got
a

off

An

million
Americans.
I
mean,
I
wear
an

For
the
money,
you
cannot
We
also
found
a
couple
of
hairs.
One
on
the
rug
at
the
Kensington
They
match.
Forgive
me
if
I'm
not
knocked
out.
Oh,
we
don't
mean
just
to
each
other.
Just
like
the
eight-and-a-half
Hey,
fellas.
I
know
you
guys
We
also
got
a
fingerprint
You
got
a
fingerprint
The
Coopersmith
lab
uses
-
You're
not
gonna
tell
me
it's
mine?
Well,
so
what?
or
I
inadvertently
drop
a
matchbook.
The
matchbook
was
found
before
You
guys
don't
doubt
my
honesty,
Let
me
tell
you,
I
was
I
got
a
number
of
merit
badges
who
happens
right
now
to
be
wanted
Nobody's
making
any
accusations.
You
do
have
some
outstanding
debt
baseball,
the
ponies.
Are
you
guys
investigating
me?
C.W.,
I
assure
you,
this
is
only
We
don't
want
the
police
Miss
Fitzgerald,
what
do
you
think?
You're
a
bright
woman.
Please,
C.W.
let's
not
have
-
She's
not
an
investigator.
She
was
the
one
who
brought
these
It's
nothin'
personal.
We
all
want
to
catch
a
jewel
thief.
Fellas,
I
think
I
want
a
resume
of
every
employee
who
Don't
worry,
C.W.
Oh,
Miss
Fitzgerald,
-
About
what,
Mr.
Magruder?
As
I
recall,
I
have
to
see
you
later.
I
behaved
like
such
a
fool.

Oh.
Well.
Can
I
come
in?
Yeah,
sure.
I-I'm
shocked.
I--
The
place
is
a
little
messy.
if
I
knew
you
were
coming,
I
would
have
Are
you
alone?
Alone?
Yeah.
Of
course.
I
would
have
called,
but
I
decided
-
What
do
you
mean,
"safer"?
Why?
You
gonna
meet
That's
none
of
your
business.
Thanks
for
coming
to
my
defense
today
in
That's
what
I
wanted
The
Coopersmith
brothers
had
Laura
She
told
them
she
was
with
you
and
that
you
got
a
phone
call
and
got
rid
of
her
because
you
Well,
let
me
tell
you,
she's
lying.
-
Why
would
she
lie?
Would
I
kick
Laura
Kensington
Even
if
the
president
needed
me.
-
Why
Are
you
lying
to
me?
Because
i
should
have
spoken
up
Because
while
I
think
you're
-
Reptile.
-
What
makes
you
so
positive?
You're
not
romantic
enough.
My
instinct's
telling
me
-
I
didn't
think
you
had
instincts.
I
don't
usually
trust
them,
especially
but
this
time
I
can
feel
it.
You're
good
at
weaselly
type
things,
You're
not
man
enough
-
You
sound
like
you're
attracted
We're
here
to
talk
about
what
Laura
Laura
Kensington
wasn't
here.
She--
You're
making--
She
said
she
left
her
stocking
here.
Hey,
that
could
be
anybody's.
A
lot
of
women
pass
I'm
not
saying
they're
all
winners,
I
'm
sure
you're
not
overly
particular.
Look.
What
do
you
want
from
me?
I
happen
to
enjoy
the
proximity
That's
how
God
created
us,
I
came
to
tell
you
a
case
is
building
-
I'm
honest.
I'm
honest.
It's
some
broad's.
The
women
that
are
here,
they
lose
Laura
Kensington
says
it's
hers.
He
let
her
in
here,
-
Whoever
that
is,
I'm
not
here.
-
Who
is
it?
I
don't
want
to
be
seen
here!
Why?
What's
the
problem?
You're
under
suspicion.
You
know,
I
think
you're
still
hooked
That's
why
you
don't--
There's
a
bedroom.
Can
I
sit
down
in
there,
Germs
can't
live
in
your
bloodstream.

Coming!
Hey,
fellas.
The
traps
with
the
cheese
-
Can
we
come
in?
I
got
a
chorus
girl
in
the
back
room,
Wouldn't
be
Laura
Kensington,
Laura
Kensington?
They
all
look
the
same
upside
down.
She
says
she
was
here
till
you
dumped
her
to
go
out
on
Hey,
would
I
dump
Laura
Kensington?
Problem
is,
Eddie,
the
night
guard
from
made
some
strange
middle-of-the-night
both
nights
the
robberies
took
place.
Fellas,
I'd
love
to
chat
there's
a
nurse
in
I
thought
you
said
Who
does
a
little
nursing?
Come
on.
We
can
discuss
this
I
don't
know
how
you
can
still
make
love
You
know,
you're
facing
That's
exactly
why
I
gotta
Yeah?
Well,
we're
gonna
turn
this
over
You
can
see.
There's
a
case
developing
This
is
circumstantial
evidence.
Many
a
man's
gone
to
the
gallows
Well,
fellas,
the
gallows
because
I
got
a
cocktail
waitress
-
Cocktail
waitress?
who--
who's
a
little
bit
and
she
works
a
lounge
now
and
then.
If
you
catch
the
jewel
thief,
-
I'll
get
you
both
new
yo-yos.
They're--
-
What
is
this?
browsing
through
your
bookshelf,
and
I
found
this
deck
This
is--
What
do
you--
This
is--
This
is
This
is
the--
This

This
is--
What
Are
you
looking
Because
you
found
them
in
amongst
What
is
the
implication
here?
I
used
to
go
with
the
six
of
spades.
Then
the
four
of
diamonds
I
was
aware
that
you
sneaked
up
and
the
lobby
guard
saw
you.
I
know
you
have
Laura
Kensington's
you
kicked
her
out
of
bed
to
They
have
a

know,
It
makes
my
work

easier.

I've
seen
some
pretty
exotic
schemes,
But
I
figured
it
out.
Don't
force
me
to
take
Don't

Why?

For
a
minute,
I
thought
-

You're
the
bravest,
most
brilliant,
most
courageous
man
I've
ever
met,
and
I
would
go
to
the
end
You
know,
everybody
should
have
somebody
It's--
It's--
You
know,
it's
such

Just--Just

before
the
ugly
curtain
of

Miss
Fitzgerald
Between

we

I'm
not
having
a
wife
at
work
Well,

positively.
I'll
be

Miss
Fitzgerald
and

She
seems
struck
by
you.
She's
a
little
demented,
but,
in
Just
came
to
say
good-bye.
Right.
Chris
and
I
No,
by
good-bye
I

happy.
'Cause

everything
here.
Want

parting
drink?
A

in
the
morning?
It's
only
tequila.
What
can
you
say
about
a
woman
who
keeps
Let's
drink
to
both
of
our
futures.
Yeah?
Today,
Mr.
Magruder.
I
will
let
that
pass
Mm.
You're
really
gonna
marry
him?
I-
I--
You
know.
For
a
brilliant
woman,
I
gotta
say,
you
have
the
worst
taste
in
men.
I
didn't
take
up
with
you.
You
know,
behind--
is
a
very
vulnerable,
But
don't
ever
let
it
come
out,
because,
you
know,
you
could
and
I
know
that
would
kill
ya.
Chris
and
I

instinct

was
one
where
I
was
wrong.

Have
a
terrific

try
not

because
I
heard
of
a
man
who
plunged

pass
-
That's
what
she
said--
You
quit,
I
go
with
ya.

That's
right.

was
all

It's
an
amazing
thing.
You

That
is
absolutely
wrong.
A

Is
that
true?
Th-

at
heart,
a
thief?
Well,
we
know
there's
I

you're
the
one
who's
always
Oh,
well,
there's
also
a
little
bit
I
mean,
that
was
kind
of
a
shock.
-
There's
a
lot
of
surprises
in
her,
Hey.
Hey.
You
got
a
little
crush
-
Who?
Fitzgerald?
What,
Are
you--

What
Are
you
talking
about?
You
can't
hate
somebody
that
much
at
least
a
little
bit
of
attraction
-
Says
who?
Come
on,
Briggsie.
You
were
the
one
I
think
I'm
in
love
with
her,
but
I--

stupidest
thing
that's

embarrassing
me.
You

this
is
Yes,
I
fear
you.

Your
heroics
do
not
entitle
you
How
can

man
confessing
love

and
they
don't
include
you.
I-
I--
You

my
hair.

mean
for
good.
