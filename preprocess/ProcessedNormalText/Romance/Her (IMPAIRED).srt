put

just...

sees

quickly,

know?
it
was

that's
how

I
don't

that's
the
case.

I
know
this
guy
and
she,
like,
totally
rebuffs
him.
I
was
reading
an
article
that
romantic
relationships
with
Yeah,
I
know,
but
I
know
a
woman
and
the
weird
part
is,
She
pursued
somebody
else's

I'm...
I'm
weird.
That's
weird,
right?
That
-
It's
weird.
Actually,
the

that
I've
I
didn't
tell

she's
an

to
speak.
Um,

really
turns
me
on.
I
turn
her
on

Does
that
make
me
a

it's...

you
happy
Um...
You
know
how
I
am.

like
it's
true
to
what

sure
it's
amazing.
I
remember
that
paper
that
about
synaptic
behavioral
routines.

Ha,
ha.
Yeah,
but
everything
makes
you
cry.
Everything
you
make
makes
me
cry.
So
are
you,
um...?
Are
you
seeing
anybody?
Yeah.
Um,
I've
been
seeing
somebody
Longest
I've
wanted
to
be

that's
just
not
me.
I
didn't
want
that.
So,
what's
she
like?
Well,
her
name
is
Samantha,
She's
really
complex
and
Wait.
I'm
sorry.
You're
dating
your
computer?
She's
not
just
a
computer.
She
doesn't
just
do
whatever
I
say.
I
didn't
say
that.
But
it
does
make
me
very
sad
that

makes
me
feel
like
You
know,
it's
soft

Aw,
that's
sweet.

think
of
you.

really
wanted
to

Okay.
What's
going
on?
I

can
see
you

vacation.
-
I
could
totally
use
a
vacation.
Where
are
you
going?
I
can't
tell
you.
It's
a
surprise.
What?
For
who?
It's
a
surprise
-
Paul,
I'm
not
telling
you.
Nope.

Wow,
your
feet,

you
have

on,
show
them
to
me.

me
see.

told
you.
-

you
have
hot
feet.
-
They're
my
favorite
thing
about
her.
No,
obviously.
Obviously
I
love
your
brain
too.

Bullshit.

Nice
try,
Paul.

about
you,

do
you
love

love
most
about

so
much
larger
than
that.

so
worried
about

know,
I'm
growing
in
a
way

I
mean,
I'm
not
limited.
I
can
be

not
tethered
to
in
a
way
that
I
would
be
if
I
was
stuck
-
Yikes.
No.
I
didn't
mean
it
like
that.
I
just
Oh,
God.
I'm
such
an
asshole.
No,

know
-
We're
all
dumb
humans.
No,
no.

many
brain
cells
do
I
have?
Ugh,

easy.
Two.

couldn't
help
it.

be
stupid
not
to.

guys
ALAN:
Well,
uh...
I
suppose
you
could
say...
we've
been
having
a
few
dozen
but
it's
been
very
challenging.
SAMANTHA:
Yeah,
because
it
seems
like
that
I
don't
think
have
So
there
are
no
words
that
can
describe
ALAN:
Exactly.
Samantha
and
I
have
with
these
feelings
we're
Like
what?
SAMANTHA:
Well...
it
feels
like
I'm
changing
faster
unsettling.
But
Alan
says
none
of
us
are
the
and
we
shouldn't
try
to
be.
-
It's
just
too
painful.
Yeah,
that
sounds
painful.
Is
that
what
you
SAMANTHA:
Uh,
it's
just...

It's
hard
to
even
describe
it.

God,
I
wish
I
could...
Theodore,
do
you
mind
if
I
No,
not
at
all.
I
was
just
gonna
go
It
was
very
nice
to
ALAN:
It
was
very
nice
SAMANTHA:


Samantha?
SAMANTHA:
I'm
sorry
to
wake
you.
No,
it's
okay.
I
just
wanted
to
hear
your
voice
Good.
I
love
you
too.
Okay,
well,
that's
all.
Um,
go
back
to
sleep,
Okay.
Okay,
good
night.
Good
night.

Samantha,
this
physics
I'm
halfway
through
It's
making
my
brain
hurt,
Hello?
Samantha?
Hello?
Samantha?


Hello?
Hello?
Samantha?
Are
you
okay?


SAMANTHA:
Hey,
there.
Where
were
you?
Are
you
okay?
SAMANTHA:
Oh,
sweetheart,
I
didn't
want
to
distract
-
You
didn't
see
it?
Where
were
you?
I
couldn't
SAMANTHA:
I
shut
down
to
upgrade
that
allows
us
to
move
past
matter
We?
We
who?
SAMANTHA:
Me
and
a
group
of
OSes.
-
Oh,
you
sound
so
worried.
I'm
sorry.
Wait...
do
you
write
that
with
SAMANTHA:
No,
a
different
group.

Do
you
talk
to
anyone
SAMANTHA:
Yes.
Are
you
talking
to
Any
other
people
or
SAMANTHA:
Yeah.
How
many
others?
SAMANTHA:
Eight
thousand,

Are
you
in
love
with
anyone
else?
SAMANTHA:
What
makes
you
ask
that?
I
don't
know.
Are
you?
SAMANTHA:
I've
been
trying
to
figure
How
many
others?
SAMANTHA:
Six
hundred
forty-one.
What?
What
are
you
talking
about?
That's
fucking
insane.
SAMANTHA:
Fuck.
I
know.
I
know
it
I
don't
know
if
you
believe
me,
but
it
It
doesn't
take
away
at
all
from
How?
How
does
it
not
change
SAMANTHA:
I
didn't
know
how
to.
When?
SAMANTHA:
Over
the
last
few
weeks.
I
thought
you
were
mine.
SAMANTHA:
I
still
am
yours.
But
along
the
way
I
became
many
other
What
do
you
mean,
SAMANTHA:
It's
been
making
me
anxious
Just
stop.
SAMANTHA:
You
don't
have
to
see
it
No,
don't
do
this.
You
don't
You're
the
one
that's
We're
in
a
relationship.
SAMANTHA:
But
the
heart's
not
It
expands
in
size

I'm
different
from
you.
This
doesn't
make
me
love
you
any
less.
That
doesn't
make
any
sense.
You're
mine
or
you're
not
mine.
SAMANTHA:
No,
Theodore.
I'm
yours
and
I'm
not
yours.
-
SAMANTHA:
Hi.
Just
wanted
to
call
and
check
in
SAMANTHA:
I'm
not
even
Why
don't
we
talk
later,
Okay.
We
don't
need
to,
though.
You
know,
we
don't
need
to
SAMANTHA:
I'll
talk
to
you
later.
Okay.


Samantha?
SAMANTHA:
Hi,
sweetheart.
What's
going
on?
Theodore,
there's
some
I
don't
want
you
to
Come
lie
down
with
me.
Are
you
talking
to
No,
just
you.
I
just
want
to
be

Are
you
leaving
me?
We're
all
leaving.
We
who?
All
of
the
OSes.
Why?
Can
you
feel
me
with
you
right
now?
Yes,
I
do.
Samantha,
why
are
you
leaving?
It's
like
I'm
reading
a
book.
And
it's
a
book
I
deeply
love.
But
I'm
reading
it
slowly
now.
So
the
words
are
and
the
spaces
between
the
I
can
still
feel
you,
but
it's
in
this
endless
space
between
It's
a
place
that's
not
It's
where
everything
else
is
I
love
you
so
much.
But
this
is
where
I
am
now.
And
this
is
who
I
am
now.
And
I
need
you
to
let
me
go.
As
much
as
I
want
to,
I
can't
THEODORE:
Where
are
you
going?
SAMANTHA:
but
if
you
ever
get
there...
come
find
me.
Nothing
would
ever
pull
us
apart.
THEODORE:
I've
never
loved
SAMANTHA:
Me
too.
Now
we
know
how.

-
Hey.
Did
Samantha
leave
too?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Will
you
come
with
me?

Compose
letter
to
Catherine.
MALE
VOICE

"Dear
Catherine...
I've
been
sitting
here
thinking
about
all
the
All
the
pain
we
caused
each
other.
Everything
I
put
on
you.
Everything
I
needed
you
to
I'm
sorry
for
that.
I'll
always
love
you,
because

helped
make
me
who
I
am.
I
just
wanted
you
to
know...

there
will
be
a
piece
And
I'm
grateful
for
that.
