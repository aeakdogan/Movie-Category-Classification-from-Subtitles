[Shutter
Whirring,

This
is
my
neighbourhood.
This
is
my
street.
This
is
my
life.
I'm
42
years
old.

Of
course,
And
in
a
way,
Look
at
me:
This
will
be
the
high
point
of
my
day.
That's
my
wife,
Carolyn.
See
the
way

That's
not
an
accident.

-
Hush.
What
is
wrong
with
you?
-
And
that's
his
lover,
Jim.
-
You
spoil
her.
-
Come
on.
Yes.
Inside.
Good
morning,
Carolyn.
I
love
your
tie!
I
just
love
your
roses.
How
do
you
Well,
I'll
tell
you:
-
I've
never
heard
that.
She
wasn't
always
like
this.
We
used
to
be
happy.
My
daughterJane.
-
Janie's
a
pretty
typical
teenager:
Angry,
insecure,
confused.
I
wish
I
could
tell
her
that's
all
going

Jane,
honey,
are
you
trying
-
Yes.
Lester,
could
you
make
me

Nice
going,
Dad.

Both
my
wife
and
And
they're
right.
I
have
lost
something.
I'm
not
exactly
sure
but
I
know
sedated.
But
you
know
what?
It's
never
too
late

For
you,
Brad,
So,

I'm
sure
you
can
understand
Oh,

You
got
to
free
up
some
cash.
-
Right?
Like
the
time
that
Mr
Flournoy

she
used

That's
unsubstantiated

you.
This
is
your
one

There
is

soon
you've

So,
Janie,
how
was

It
was
okay.
Just
okay?
No,
Dad.
Well,
you
want
to
know
They've
hired
this
really
friendly
guy
How
perfect
is
that?
in
firing
somebody,
No,
no.
That
would
just
be
too
honest.

You
couldn't

I
still
like

is
great,

there's

No,

Oh,
my
God.

It's

I've
been
waiting
for

Nothing.

were

Yes,
you
were.

was

whacks
off

you're
obviously
not
going

think
you're
the

Don't
you
mess

will
divorce
you
so
fast,
On
what
grounds?

not
a
drunk.
I
don't
mistreat
you.
I
don't

try
to
touch
you,

how
unnecessary
