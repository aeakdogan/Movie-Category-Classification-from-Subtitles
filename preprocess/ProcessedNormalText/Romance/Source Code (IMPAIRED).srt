Are
you

right?
I
don't
know
what's

Talk

Look,
I
don't

Okay.
We'll

What?
I

There

Some
confusion

perfectly
normal
Do
you

Who

You
already
have

-
I
do?
We'll
rebuild

Try
to

I...
I
was
on

I
was
flying,
and
then
I
woke
up
on

And
now
I'm

Her

Recall

Goodwin.
Your

That

correct.
Welcome
back,
Captain.

Ma'am,
I
need
to
talk
to
my
father.
Has
anybody
been
notified
Who
bombed
the
train,
Captain?
What?
Who
bombed
the
train?
A
woman
kept
calling
me
Sean.
That
is
incidental.
Think,
Captain.
Remember
back.
Who
bombed
the
train?
I
don't
know
who
bombed
-
Then
go
back
and
try
again.
You
will
have
eight
minutes,
No,
no,
no,
no.
I
need
to
know
where
I
am.
What
is
the
location
Does
anybody
know
that
I'm
stateside?
You
are
obligated
Start
with
the
bomb.
Where
is
it?
What
does
it
look
like?
What
kind
of
explosive?
-
Right.
and
you
will
find
the
bomber.
Find
the
bomb.
Wait,
no,
I...
I
took
your
advice.
Okay.
That's
good.
And
I
signed
up
for
an
LSAT
course.
Next
thing
you
know,

Know
any
good
gurus?

She
got

So,
what
do
you
think?
It's
the
same

but
it's
different.
Deep.
I
hope
it's
different.
I
feel
the
same
way.

What?

-
COLTER:
Do
I
have...
What
is
it
with
guys?
COLTER:
What
is...
This
looks
so
real.
I
think
it's
gonna
be
really
good
for
me
Unbelievable
detail.

May
I
see
your

They
wouldn't
put

What

you

You
seem
concerned
about

I'm

That
means

Thank

It's

So

Sir?
Sir.
Is
there
a

here,

I'm

I

you
to

Sean?
-
Turn

Hey!
Sean!
What

Hey,
not

ma'am.
That's
not

I'm

Not

Stabilize.
Lower

Did
you
find
the

Yes.
There's
hydraulic
fluid
all
over

It's
not
a

Captain.
-
What
is...
Where's
that
man?
He
looks
like
he's
in
charge.
That's
irrelevant,
Captain.
I
want
to
talk
to
your
commanding
officer!
You
can
talk
to
him
upon
completion
My

is
in
Afghanistan,
I
flew
two
goddamn
sorties
yesterday!
You've
been
with

for

Did
you
ID
the

No.
Where's
my

And
under
whose
jurisdiction
Captain,
this
is
not
a

What

What
do
you
remember
about
the

No,
no,
no.
What
lives?
I
need
to
be
briefed.
Sir,
I
need
to
give

something.
That's

Go

Okay.
Get

am.
Guess
what?
You
quit
your
job
Good
guess.
Soda
can.
-
Coffee
spill.
Listen
to
me.
Don't
answer
this.

You
deserve
better
than
that
guy.
Everything
looks
more
beautiful

CONDUCTOR:
Ticket?
-
Are
we
going
to
make
up
the
10
minutes?
-
How
well
do
you
know
me?
Not
that
well,
apparently.
Do
you
know
me
well
enough
a
little
strange
but
I
told
you
to
trust
me
anyway,
No.
Wow.
That
was
honest.
You're
beautiful.
You're
kind.
And
you're
painfully
honest.
Who
are
you?
It's
the
new
me.
ANNOUNCER:
Now
approaching
Glenbrook
Station,
next
stop.
CONDUCTOR:
Ticket?
Glenbrook
Station.
All
right,
I
don't
wanna
hurt
you.

CHRISTINA:
No,
I'm
not
gonna
sit
in
my
seat,
He
needs
medical
attention.
Is
it
true
that
you
tried
to
steal
a
gun
Careful,
ma'am.
-
Damn
it!
-
Can
I
borrow
your
phone?
-
Please,
please,
let
me
borrow
your
phone.
What
would
you
do
I
don't
know.
I
would
call
my
dad.
I
would
hear
his
voice,
and
I'd
tell
him
I
was
sorry.

Tell
me
everything's
gonna
be
okay.
Everything's
gonna
be
okay.
Oh,
yeah,
the
gun
in
the
strongbox,
Did
you
make
any
progress?
Can
I
get
access
to
a
phone?
I
need
to
talk
to
my
father.
I
will
try
to
work
on
that
soon.
Goodwin,
how
am
I
doing?
I'm
just
trying
Have
you
ever
gone
back
in?
We
are
wasting
valuable
time
here.
No,
no.
I
have
never
been
on
the
other
side
-
I
wouldn't
be
a
viable
candidate.

CAOC-N.
What
is
that?
Because
the
specifications
What
are
they?
Captain,
you
should
have
found
a
suspect
This
tactical
advantage,
don't
squander
it
thinking.
Do.
Please
contact
my
father
for
me.
This
will
stop
at
some
point,
Captain.
As
soon
as
you
finish
the
mission.
And
you're
doing
really
great.
And
this
will
end.
Now,
whoever
planted
the
bomb
Some
gloves,
a
screwdriver
to
get
flashlight,
something.
Check
bags
and
backpacks,
So,
I
took
your
advice.
-
It
was
very
good
advice.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
What
is
that?
Were
you
in
the
military?
A
friend
of
mine
was.
He
was
in
Afghanistan
and
he
disappeared,
Do
you
have
the
Internet
on
your
phone?
No.
It's
just
connected
to
the
office
Do
you
think
you
can
see
-
Sure.
His
name
is
Captain
Colter
Stevens.
Okay.
You
owe
me.
I'll
buy
you
a
cup
of
coffee.
Why
don't
I
get
one
for
you
now?
Okay.
Christina?
Um...
I've
been
having
these
dreams
lately.
Really
vivid.
And
you've
been
in
them.
Really?
What?
Oh.
No.
Not
like
that.
It's
just...
Um...
I'll
call
you
back
in
a
minute,
all
right?
Yeah.
-
Cramming?
For
what?
Psych.
And
I
got
a
big
test
this
morning,
Can
I
borrow
a
pen?
Yeah,
sure.
Whoa!
Hey,
that's
not
cool,
man!
Hey,
your
bag
is
a
mess.
What
are
you
doing,
man?
Never
find
what
I'm
looking
for.
How
about
you
let
the
guy
Finish
your
deal.
Stay
out
of
this,
tough
guy.
This
guy.
Don't
do
that.
Nothing.
What
am
I
doing?
Jesus.
Dick.
CAOC-N.
-
WOMAN:
Can
you
believe
that?
Excuse
me,
ma'am?
Hey,
how
are
you
doing?
Good
morning.
-
Do
you
work
at
Walter
Reed?
-
I'm
in
the
military.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I
am.
I
was
wondering...
Then
what
was
going
on
down
there?
Oh,
you
know,
uh...
We
were
just
having
a
little
bit
Is
that
what
they
train
you
to
do?
No,
ma'am,
please.
Do
any
of
these
letters,
Do
you
know
what
the
"N"
stands
for?
It's
Air
Force,
and
the
"N"
stands
for
Nellis.
Now
approaching
Glenbrook
Station.
Thank
you.
Can
I
borrow
your
phone?
You
know
what?
I
don't
even
need
to
borrow
it.
-
Just
for
a
couple
minutes...
All
right.
Thank
you
so
much.
This
is
a
Chicago-bound
train.
Next
stop,
Chicago,
Union
Station.
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on,
come
on.
Post

Name,

You
tell
him
-
Hold

Doors

OPERATOR:
Dr.
Rutledge
I
have
to
tell
you
something.
-
I
know.
I
found
him.
-
I
got
him.
Nellis
Air
Force
Base.
Las
Vegas.
He's
dead,
Sean.
What?
I'm
sorry.
Your
friend
was
killed
No,
you
must've
gotten
the
name
wrong.
Colter
Stevens.
It
was
on
the
first
site
I
tried.
His
father's
name
is
Donald,
right?
This
is
from
last
week.
"Donald
Stevens
will
join
host,
"the
death
of
his
son,
"who
died
in
Afghanistan
in
February,
"and
was
honored
posthumously
"Also
on
the
broadcast
"whose
life
was
saved
by
Captain
Stevens
"in
a
fire
fight
just
outside
of
Kandahar."
I'm
sorry.
GOODWIN:

Captain?
Sean?
Talk
to
me.
Captain?
Captain
Stevens,
You're
with
Operation
Beleaguered
Castle.
Hey,
this
guy's
crashing!

GOODWIN:
Captain,
just
tell
me
what
you
see.
COLTER:
I
see
a
card.
GOODWIN:
That's
good.
COLTER:
Do
you
copy?
GOODWIN:
That's
very
good.
Am
I
dead?
A
radio
listing
is
saying
that
I
died
and
my
father
received
a
medal
for
me.
Your
condition's
not
the
issue
here.
You
need
to
focus
on
preventing
Everything
else
is
irrelevant.
A
news
report
saying
that
I'm
dead
Until
the
person
or
persons
Goodwin,
one
soldier
to
another,
am
I
dead?
Part
of
your
brain
remains
activated.
What
about
the
rest
of
me?
They
still
move.
They
are
a
manifestation.
They're
just
your
way
of
making
sense
So,
what
are
you
saying?
I'm
imagining
that
I'm
still
alive,
MAN:
We
have
core
temp
dropping.

Captain,
what
just
happened?
I
asked
you
a
question.

The
capsule
is
a
manifestation
as
well.
Where
am
I?
That's
classified.
Fuck
you!
Captain,
I
cannot
imagine
But
if
we're
to
prevent
a
second
attack,
And,
Captain,
while
inside
the
source
code,
even
to
investigate
your...
Even
to
investigate
what
happened
to
you.
There's
only
one
continuum
on
this
end
Well,
you
know
what?
I
did
unsettle
it.
Just
before
the
explosion,
-
they
paged
you
with
a
call
from
me.
but
I
would
never
receive
it
here.
If
the
call
even
went
through,
it
would
be
received
This
may
be
difficult
for
you
to
hear,
We
set
you,
you
move
forward.
And
that
represents
the
entirety
You
know
what?
I'll
see
if
that
makes
an
impression!
You
cannot
alter
the
continuum
This
can't
be
legal,
what
you're
doing.
In
fact,
your
acquisition
by
this
program
has
been
reviewed
and
sanctioned
Many
soldiers
would
find
this
The
opportunity
to
continue

Have
you
spent
much
time
in
battle,
sir?
Huh?
That's
immaterial.
Any
soldier
I've
ever
served
with
would
say
Fine.
You
can
have
that
in
return
-
Have
what?
Terminate
your
service.
Let
you
die.
This
is
taking
too
long.
You've
been
too
easy
on
him.
I
am
certain
we
can
find
other
servicemen
with
wounds
similar
to
yours
being
a
part
of
this
program
an
honor.
What?
No,
wait,
what?
Send
him
back.
Charge
the
drivers.
And
Captain
Stevens,
that
it's
not
only
about
you,
two
million
real-world
Americans.
I
do,
however,
ask
that
you
value
theirs.
CHRISTINA:
Your
advice.
Hey,
Grandpa.

Calm
yourself.
You're
back.
There
are
hundreds
of
people
on
that
train.
Well,
then
check
them
out
one
by
one.
It
doesn't
matter
what
you
do
to
them.
Get
to
that
gun,
But
get
us
some
usable
intel.

No,
wait!
We
have
to
keep
doing
this
Please.
I'm
trying.
I'm
trying.
Who
is
the
bomber?
I'm
trying.
I'm
sorry,
Captain.
I
know
you're
exhausted,
but
we
cannot
fail.
You
can
do
this.
I
can't.
I
can't.
Yes,
you
can.
You're
a
born
hero,
son.
Even
your
father
thinks
so.
Saving
people
is
what
you
do
best.
DONALD:
It
was
about
his
third
tour.
-I
didn't
want
him
to
go
back.
I
just
started
feeling
like
-Dad?
And
he
wouldn't
talk
to
me,
Finally
he
said
he
just
couldn't
leave
and
that
was
that.
Those
guys
were
his
family.
I
said
some
things
I
shouldn't
have.
I
never
fully
understood
him.
And
I
can't
believe
he's
gone.
Send
me
back
in.
Please
don't
blow
me
up
again.

Hello?
I
know
it's
you.
ANNOUNCER:
Now
approaching
I'm
gonna
find
you.
Turn
around.
-
Hey,
there.
Why
do
you
look
so
surprised?
Don't.
Move.
I
said
move.
Move.
-
Okay.
-
Put
the
bag
over
there
and
move
over.
Move
over.
Move
over.
-
You're
done.
You're
done.
You
can't
kill
anybody
anymore.
What?
I
don't
understand.
You
were
going
to
trigger
the
bomb
What?
Dude,
I

I
don't
know
Listen,
my
name's
George
Troxel.
-
Right.
Try
it
again.
Your
call.
Dial
it
again.
Okay.
I'm
gonna
press
redial.
Your
phone
is
gonna
ring,

Shit.
I'm
sorry.
Sorry.
MAN:
Hey!
You
dropped
this.
Wow.
Thanks.
WOMAN:
Hey!
All

Shit!
No!
No!
No!
Wait!

No!
Come

Stop
the

Hey!
Hey!
-
Derek
Frost.
-
See
this?
-
You
recognize
it?
Jesus.
How
about
you
give
me
your
wallet?
Okay.

You
left
it
on
the
train
deliberately.
I
must
have
dropped
it.
No.
You
planted
it
there,

I
know
it's
you.
How
do
you
know
so
much?
What
the
hell
is
that
thing?
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Slow
down!
Slow
down!
Do
you
wanna
see
it?
Very
patriotic.
Slowly,
slowly!
All
right,
all
right!

Not
many
people
could
build
that.
All
right.
Where
is
your
next
target?
Sean?

Oh,
my
God!

Sean
Fentress?
Teacher.
History.

I
don't
know
you.
I
think
I
killed
your
girlfriend.

Why?
You
messed
up
my
timing.
-
Why?
You
mean
"Why
this?"
Because
the
world
is
hell.
But
we
have
a
chance
to
start
over
But
first
there
has
to
be
rubble.
You're
a
teacher,
you
understand.
Christina.
Stay
with
me.
Stay
with
me.
Everything's
gonna
be
okay.
This
isn't
the
end.
Check
through
there.
I'll
go
check
this
way.



-
Okay.
Captain,
this
is
Beleaguered

Captain
Stevens,
this
is
Beleaguered
Castle.
I
have
your
bomber.
I
have
his
name.
You
have
the
bomber's
name?
Derek
Frost.
He
got

a
rented
white
van

Charlie,

All
right,
let's

And
Goodwin,
there
is
Some
kind
of
bomb.
Thank
you,
Captain.
Yes,
ma'am.
Thank
you,
Captain.
About
our
deal?
I
had
hoped
that
you
might
reconsider
that,
I
have.
I
want
something
else
now.
Good.
I
still
wanna
die.
But
I
want
to
go
back
in
and
I
wanna
save
all
those
people
It
doesn't
work
that
way.
It
can't.
No,
I
know.
I
know,
I
know.
I'm

Can

This
is
real

Here.
The
one
where
you're
talking
to
The

wasn't
designed
It
was
designed
to
affect
the
future.
I
missed
something,
Captain.
That
train
shouldn't
have
blown
up.
There
must
have
been
a
second

something
I
couldn't
see.
A
fail-safe.
It's
a

Captain.
The

on
the

all
the
others,
I'm
sorry
about
that.
I
get
it.
I
get
it.
I
know.
You're
wrong,
Goodwin.
You're
just
plain
wrong.
Captain,
Christina
is
dead.
She
doesn't
have
to
be,
ma'am.
Okay.
I'll
ask
Rutledge.
I'm
asking
you,
I'm
asking
you.
Just...
Send
me...

Captain.
It's
your
choice.
At
the
end
of

There
will
be
no

back.
I'm
gonna
save
her,
Goodwin.
It
was
an

Captain.
And
I
thank
you
for
your
service.
Good
luck.
I
took
your
advice.
You're
gonna
move
to
India,
-

Yeah,
I'm
gonna
go
Well,
maybe
you'll
have
a
cup
of
coffee
Yeah.
I'd
like
to
do
that.
Put
it
to
the
test.
Good.
Let's
do
it
today.
Let's
just
skip
work.

-
You
know
what?
I
feel
really
good.
Why?
Because
I've
been
waiting
for
weeks
Ticket?
Okay.
Just
give
me
a
couple
minutes,
okay?
Gotta
go
save
the

I

Excuse
me!
Beautiful

Oh,
I'm

Sorry.
Glenbrook

You

Yeah,
well,

Look,

we

Really?
That
many?
You're
a

hero,
Dr.

Well,
thank
you.
We
did
save
lives
today.
Yes,
a
true
victory
for
the

A
great
victory
for
us
all.
We'll
talk
soon.
So?
Exciting
times.
Let's
initialize

start
crunching

Sir,
we
told
Captain
Stevens
that
we
were
gonna
let
him
die.
Let
him
die?
He
just
saved
millions
of
lives
today.
How
many
other
disasters
For
all
we
know,
he
may
be
the
only
candidate
So,
let's

Hello,

Hello?
Yes?
My

DONALD:
Who?
COLTER:
I
served
with
your
son,
Colter.
-
Oh,
boy.
I'm
sorry
it's
taken
me
so
long
to
call
you.
Sometimes
it
just
takes
a
while
to
figure
out
Don't
be
too
hard
on
yourself.
How
are
you
doing,
sir?
Well,
all
that
came
back
was
some
ash.
It's
hard
to
believe
that
it
was
him.
How
well
did
you
know
him?
I
was
there
when
he
died,
sir.
He
said
that
the
last
time
and
he
wanted
to
say
that
he
was
sorry.
I
just
want
him
back.
I
loved
him
so
much.
I
wish
you
could
have
told
him
that.
He
knows
it.
You
take
care,
Mr.
Stevens.
You
okay?
Yeah.
Save
the
world?
Sort
of.
So,
where
were
we?
Getting

Shit.

Don't

You'll

Thank
you
for
that
moment
of
Zen,
What,
are
you
selling
self-help
CDs
today?
Security?
Get
me
a

Why
are
you
always
so
bitter,
Max?
It's
a
bitter
world
we
live
in,
my
friend.
It
doesn't
have
to
be.
I
will
bet
you
$100
you
can't
make

Actually,
you
know
what?
126
bucks.
Is
that
your
way
of
making
fun
of
me?
I
guess
you
have
a
better
gig.
Never
mind.
No,
no.
I'm
good.
Easiest
money
ever.

What?
All

Goodwin.
Open
this
door.
MAX:
Put
those
headphones
on.
-Why
do
you
keep
looking
at
your
watch?
what
would
you
do
if
you
knew

had
I'd
make
those
seconds
count.
I'd
kiss
you
again.
Again?
Mmm.
Goodwin,
open

He's
done
enough,
Doctor.
