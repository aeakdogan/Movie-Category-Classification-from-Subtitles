dressed
up.

Anyway--

There's
literally,
I'm
just
not
gonna
be
able
to

You
asked
for
them
I
did,
but
they
never--
-
There's
a
big
red
one
So,
John,
What?
You
came
in
and
I
just
started
blabbing
I
get
overly
excited
sometimes,
I
honestly
am
curious
and,
you
know,
Well,
uh,
let's
see.
I
do
freelance
I
like
to
go
to
the
movies.
-

what
else
do
you
I
don't
want
to
know
I
want
to
know
what
you
are.
That's
more
what
I'm--
Are
we
really
gonna--
I'm
divorced.
I
got
divorced,
like,
And
it
wasn't
my
idea.
It
was--
Uh,
I
was
kind
and
my
wife
at
the
time
Told
me
so.
I
ran
away
from
her
and
made
a
huge
mistake...
and
have
been
in
kind
of
a
dark,
And
then
I
met
your
mom
and,
I
don't
know.
Seems
like
things
are
That's--
You
asked.
I
like
your
style,
John.
To
John--
Our
new
friend.

That
was
a
lot
So,
uh,
are
you
gonna

Um,
I
think
that's

I
was
just
messing
around.
It's
valid.
It's
valid.
I
mean--
Molly?
Seriously,
don't
fuck
my
mom.
I'm
just
kidding.
Cy!
I
know.
I--
that's
my
attempt

Enough
said.
We
did
have
sex.
I
mean,
if
you
want
to
be
I'm
sorry
if
that's
but
I'm
not
gonna
sit
here
We
met
at
a
party
and--
Okay.
I
mean,
I
don't
want
to
You
seem
like
you
want
to
be
That's
just
it.
That's--
That's--
I
accept
that
information.

-
Hey,
John?
I
just
want
to
say
I
thought
what
you
did
at
dinner,
And
I
know
it
was
weird,
Thanks.
And
it's
great
to
finally

You
got
to
get
used
But
I
really
thought
that
was--
-
Actually,
your
mom's




Hi.
-
Night,
John.
-
Night,
Molly.
Good
shower?
Yeah.
You
know,
there's
something
I
really
appreciated
what
you
And
I've--
I--
I
feel
a
little,
um--
I
guess
a
little
embarrassed
It's
not
even
that.
I
just
want
to
say
I
appreciate
I
love
that
about
you,
and
I'm
sorry
that
I
wasn't
No,
that's
fine.
It's
your--
Yeah,
I
know.
It's
private,
we
just
met,
He's
a
great
kid
too.
I'm
glad
you
appreciate
that.
I
was
going
to
leave,
and
he
was,
like,
I'm
happy
to
hear
that.
I
didn't--
And
that's
the
thing.
He's
very
mature,
and
he
really
pushes
me.
But
in
other
ways
he's
just--
And-And
it's
coming,
This
could
be
a--
You
are
very
sudden.
And
I
haven't
had
a
man
over--
to
stay
overnight--
since
Cyrus,
uh,
was
born.
So
it's
a
new
thing.
Well--
I--
I
stalked
you
over--
Yeah,
you
gave
it
a
little--
I
get
seized
sometimes,
Molly,
everything
is
a
gift,
Just
getting
to
hang
out.
Like
every
moment,
Thanks
for
talking
to
me
I
just
feel
a
little--
N-N-N--
No,
we
leave
the
door
open.
Oh.
I
was
just
going
to
We
just--
We--
Um,
okay.
Hey.

Good
morning.
Yep.
How'd
you
sleep?
Good.
Good.
So
what's--
What's,
uh--
What's
going
on?
What
are
you
guys
doing?
Um,
we
go
to
Elysian
Park
and
take
some
photos
Yeah.
Cyrus
composes
Sounds
cool.
Should
I
blow
it
off?
I'll
just
get
it
over
with.
I'll
get
in
there.
Get
it
done.
Anyway,
all
right.
Here
you
go,
Mom.
-

No.
Weird.

Yeah.
I
can't
believe
That's
amazing.
Thank
you.
It's
amazing.
Am
I--
Am
I
glowing?
You
look
good.
Let's
just
be
here
now.
I
know.
I
just
don't
I
was
a
little
needy
I'll
admit
that.
And
other
than
one
little
I
am
not
concerned
What?
What
is
it?
Um,
when
I
woke
up
this
morning,
Your
white
Adidas?
Your
favorite
shoes.
Well,
then
somebody
Whatever.
-

-
John?
You
know
what
I
mean?
Can
we
not
have
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
But
the
more
I
think
now
it's
like
every
look
the
kid
-
Like
he
was
Will
you
please
do
me
a
favor
and
tell
me
whether
I'm
the
one
Sure.
Fine.
I
will,
okay?
It's
got
to
be
totally
casual
No.
Higher
so
that
Okay.

Mmm.
I
love
the
ripples.
There
they
are.
It
ripples
out
almost
Hey.
Oh,
my
gosh,
Cyrus.
How
you
doing?
I'm
Cyrus.

I
was
just
saying,
-
I'm
Molly.
We've
met.
-
We
go
jogging
here
Yeah.
Yeah,
you
said
that,
I
guess,
I
don't
know.
We
took
a
little
bit
of

Your
hair--
It's
like
a
crippled
tree
John,
would
you
do
me
Yeah,
what?
Would
you
mind
Try
one
where
Like
a
jaguar?
Oh,
that's
great.
You're
a
natural.
Now
do
one
where
you
just


You
look
incredible
right
now.





Yes!
I
think
and,
uh,
kind--
And
the
wrestling
No,
that
was
weird.
I
don't
think
it
was,
I
mean,
They're
really
cool.
They're
cool,
right?
They're
fun.
And
I
don't
think
Thank
you
for
coming
out
here.
Don't
worry.
Relax,
okay?
Okay.
You're
the
best,
Jamie.

Okay.
That
one.
That
one's
great.
No,
let's
skip
that
one.

Oh,
that's
perfect.
That's
the
perfect
one.
Hello?
Hi.
No,
no,
no.
Okay.
Who's
that?
John.
Cool.
I
was--
I--
-
I
don't
know.
Anyway,
That
was
a
lot.
I
know.
-
I
feel
weird.
I
think
it's
nice
that
I
think
it's
lovely,
but
I
still
feel--
I
feel
really--
You
feel
weird?
Why
do
you
feel
weird?
Are
you
okay
If
I
was
10,
and
you
deserve
somebody
in
a
way
that
I
think
it's
great.
I'm
the
weirdo.
Hey.
How
you
doing?
Hey,
Cyrus.
Hi.
Welcome.
Well,
well,
well.
You've
closed
the
door.

Ohh!

lot
and
I
just
recently
I'm
sorry.
I'll
get
through
it.
Um,
I'm
glad
you're
up,
because
I've
been
wanting
No.
I'm--
I'm
all
right.
I
didn't
want
to
say
anything,
I
think--
Okay.
She
said
that?
She
didn't
say
it
Wow.
I
mean--
I
don't
want
to
get
into
it,
but
I
was
getting

In
the
past,
when
she's
losing
interest,
she
tends

just
think
that

speaking,
Wow.
Okay.
Okay,

Jamie!
I
have
to
do
this.
Can

mom's
The

time

tired
So
don't
say

And
it's
upsetting
But
it's
not
It's
gonna
be
terrible.

That's
true.
Things
are
really
That
makes
me
feel
better.

Just
be
honest
with
me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank
you.
You're
welcome.

of
waking
up
"I
gotta
get
over
to
her
house.
What
do
you
think?
Did
you
just
ask
to
move
in?
Yes.
I
did.
So,
hold
on.
Hold
on.
But...
I
don't
know
which
way

wind
And
I
don't
know
I
don't
think
that
he
knows
Let's
take
it
day
by
day...
for
as
long
as
we
can
go.

Yeah,
let's
do
this.
Where
are
you
going?
Right
there.
I'm
taking
you
right
there.
Oh,
my
goodness.
I
want
to
get
fucked.
Mm-hmm.
Hey,
guys.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
What
the--
Hey,
man.

Sorry
for
Hi.
Uh,
were
you
planning
on
We
didn't
get
a
message.
Just
came
home
for
a
bit.
That
was,
uh,
bad
timing
Can
I
have
a
hug?
Yeah.
Come
here.
I
went
through
something
Oh,
baby.
What
happened?

He
wants
to
come
back
home.
Okay.
He's
been
having
Oh,
no.
Hmm.
The
weird
thing
is,
He
is
an
adult
and--
But
these
and
that
doesn't
Yeah.
No.
I
know,
I
know.
Yep.
Ohh.
Do
you
mind
if

Hey.
You
can
relax.
I'm
sorry?
We
should
talk.
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing
Oh,
you're
going
to
stop
You
know,
I
was
gonna
apologize
But
after
this
shit
What
are
you
gonna
do?
You
gonna
light
You
are
out
of
your
league.
I
will
do
What
do
you
think
Who's
going
to
Who
do
you
think
Her
son,
who
needs
her
now
or
this
new
guy
who
clearly
You
listen
to
me,
If
you
want
to
mess
with
me,
Oh,
buddy.
Everything
okay?
Yeah.
I
was
feeling
I
was
talking
to
John
about
The
thought
of
going
back
makes
me
all...
fluttery
and
nauseous.
You
don't
have
to
You
know,
um,
I've
never
told
anybody
I
used
to
get
You
did?
So
I
know
how
scary
Wow.
You
know,
I
didn't.
I
couldn't
imagine
Yeah,
but
I
did.
It
was
terrifying.
They
didn't
even
call
them
I
just
thought
I
almost
left
college.
But
I
decided
to
tough
it
out.
And
that
decision
This
could
be
that
Where
you
go
from
and
you
say,
"You
know
what?
-
Do
you
guys
not
want
me
'Cause
if
so,
just
say
so,
I'll
figure
something
out.
No.
Not
at
all.
Look.
You
know
what
You
know
in
your
heart
When
I
looked
in
my
heart,
I
decided
that
it--
I
decided
that
was
not
defeat,
but,
in
a
way,
And
if
it's
okay
I'd
really
like

Okay.
Thank
you,
John.
You're
an
amazingly
Thanks,
buddy.

I
am
so
fucked.
Honey?
I
think
it's
time
you
You
know,
I
can't.
Because
if
I
do,
it's
just
gonna
be
between
me
I
lose.
I
can't
do
that.
But
you
tell
me
and
if
you
really
love
her,
It
doesn't,
you
know--
Good
night.
I
love
you.

Oh,
um,
I
forgot
to
ask.
A
what?
A
tie.
Uh,
yeah.
I
think
I
do.
I've
got
a
bunch
of
ties,
Thanks.
Um,
wow.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I-I--
I-I
know
it's
a
lot,
but
he's
going
through
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,
I
don't
know
Uh,
do
you
ever
feel
like...
Cyrus
is
not
being...
a
hundred
percent
genuine?
How
do
you
mean?
I
know
he's
going
Um,
I
mean,
like--
I'm
sorry.
No.
Uh--
He's
behaving
in
a
way
is--
um--
All
right,
I
wasn't
gonna
tell
you
My
shoes
were
Hidden.
So,
what--
I
don't
know.
You
know,
and
I
want
to
put
he
might
be...
acting...
out...
with
this
behavior.
How
long
have
you
Do
I
feel
that
way?
I'm
just
unearthing
things
You
know
what?
We
should
have
Cyrus
Let's
talk
about
this.
Trust
me.
He's
having
panic
attacks.
We'll
have
a
great
time
Yeah.
Yeah.


It's
okay.
Cyrus.
Shh.
Are
you
all
right?
Yeah.
I
want
to
talk
to
you.
Listen,
I
know
why
This
wedding
is
really,
And
my
ex-wife's
feelings
And
I
know
we've
been
messing
and
it
would
be
a
great
time
I
agree.
But
here's
the
thing.
Do
you
know
what
it
feels
like
Because
if
I
sense
for
or
you're
even
thinking
Do
you
understand?
Yeah.
Then
let's
have
a
great
time
How

doing,
Roger?
Thank
you.
Um,
you
know
this
is
a
big
day
Yes.
Okay.
I
choose
you
to
be
mine.
To
live
with
you
To
stand
by
your
side
To
be
joy
to
your
heart
To
bring
out
the
best
Jamie

my
lawfully

love
and
to
cherish--

love

John.
John.




What?

What
happened?
I
saw
the
way
you
You
can't
marry
her.
Listen
to
me.
Before
you
embarrass
yourself,
let
me
call
you
a
cab
Hey,
hey,
hey.
What'd
I
warn
you
Don't
you
do
this
to
me!
Knock
it
off!
Calm
the
fuck
down!
-
Get
your
shit
together!
Fuck
you!
Go,
John!
-
Just
go
away
Stop
it!
You

it!
What
are
you
doing?
Hey!
Hey!

What,
are
you
You
stop
it!
-
Did
you
hit
him?

you
hit
him?

Open
your
eyes,
Molly.

Well,
I
didn't
see
I
didn't
even
know
Did
you
think
tackled
Cyrus
-
How
could
you
I
just
saw
my
son
From
the
moment
as
soon
as
your
son
Every
step
of
the
way,
every
time
I
tried
to
be
He
hates
me,
Molly.
-
He
hates
me.
He's
not
having
a
tough
time.
Your
son
hates
me.
And
I
gotta
say,
Nothing
here
worth
taking
You
and
I--
We
do
have
something.
And
I
know
how
rare
it
is,
because
it's
since
I
had
anyone
But
I
am
not
prepared...
to
get
deeper
into
it
and
and
then
two
years
down
the
line
and
you
guys
have
each
other,
and
I'm
alone
again.
I
just
think
He's
gonna
not--
So
that's
it.
I'm
sorry.



I
feel
like
And
I
feel
that
with
the
way
that
I
raised
you,

who
we
are
I
don't
think
to
feel
negatively
about
that.

letting
another
person...
hang
out
with
us
is...
unhealthy
for
us,
I
feel.
I
don't
want
you
I
want
you
to
be
alone
forever
I
want
you
to
find
somebody
But
I
know
in
my
heart

There
are
things
I-I--
I
know
what
happened
Who
cares?
It's
shoes.
It's
so
stupid.
But
I
care
if

I
used
to
feel
like
I'm
feeling
like
you...
are
letting
me
go
away.

ever
take
your
place.
Ever.




What
do
you
want?
I
want
you
to
come
back
Are
you
Come
on,
It's
not
the
same
anymore!
No.
She's
depressed!
She
misses
you,
John!
Yeah,
I
know!
We
had
a
great
thing,
Please,
John.
Just
hear
me
out
I'll
move
out.
Don't
punish
her
I-I--
It's--
It's
not
her
fault.
It's
not
her
fault!
So
you
just
live
with
that,
It's
your
fault
that
I'm
back
You're
a
little
fucking
liar
So
fuck
you!
Go
away!
Are
you
still
out
there?
Move
over.


Let
me
ask
you
something.
Were
the
panic
attacks
They
were
real
at
first,
sometimes
I
would
fake
them

I
brought
you
something.
It's
mixed,
So
it's
not
final.
I
think
I
might
be
You
did
some
But
it's
my
fault
too.
How'd
you
get
through

I'm
sorry.
I
made
that
up


It
was
war
at
that
point.
I
was
desperate.
You
were
boxing
me
out.
You're
good,
John.
Well,
you're
good.
Would
you
mind--
Would
you
mind
Okay.
Is
your
mom
home?
No.
All
right.
'Cause--
I
don't
know.
I'm
just--
I'm
really
not
ready


Thanks
for
the
ride.
I
have
some
of
your
stuff
I'll
go
grab
it.
Right
now?



Please
Realize
we're
okay

we're
okay

can't
wait
Will
you
be
there

you
be
there

love

too
fast
Look

the
mouth

been
waitin'
for
you
Look
