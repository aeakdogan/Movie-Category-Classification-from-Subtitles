BELLA:
I'd
never
given
much
thought

But
dying
in
the
place
of
someone
I
love


BELLA:
So
I
can't
bring
myself
I
would
miss
Phoenix.
I'd
miss
the
heat.
I
would
miss
my
loving,
erratic,

Okay.
PHIL:
Renee,
come
on.
Guys,
come
on.
I
love
you
both.
But
they
want
to
go
on
the
road,
and
this
will
be
a
good
thing.
I
think.

When
the
thorn
bush
turns
white
That's
when
I'll
come
home
I
am
going
out
to
see
what
I
can
sow
And
I
don't
know
where
I'll
go
And
I
don't
know
what
I'll
see
BELLA:
In
the
state
of
Washington,
under
a
near
constant
cover
there's
a
small
town
named
Forks.
Population,
3,
120
people.
This
is
where
I'm
moving.
My
dad's
Charlie.
He's
the
chief
of
police.
Curse
the
powers
that
be
Cause
all
I
want
is...
Your
hair's
longer.
I
cut
it
since
the
last
time
I
saw
you.
Guess
it
grew
out
again.
BELLA:
I
used
to
spend
two
weeks
here
but
it's
been
years.
I've
cleared
some
shelves
off
Right.
One
bathroom.
It's
a
pretty
good
work
lamp.
The
sales
lady
picked
out
the
bed
stuff.
You
like
purple,
right?
Purple's
cool.
Thanks.
Okay.
BELLA:
One
of
the
best
things
about
Charlie,
he
doesn't
hover.

Heard
you
guys
coming
Good
to
see
you.
-
Bella,
you
remember
Billy
Black.
-
Wow,
you're
looking
good.
I'm
glad
you're
finally
here.
Charlie
here
hasn't
shut
up
about
it

All
right,
keep
exaggerating.
After
I
ram
you
in
the
ankles.
-
CHARLIE:
You
want
to
go?
Bring
it.
-
Hi,
I'm
Jacob.
We
used
to
make
mud
pies
Right.
No,
I
remember.

Are
they
always
like
this?
-
It's
getting
worse
with
old
age.
So,
what
do
you
think?
Of
what?
-
Your
homecoming
present.
-
Just
bought
it
off
Billy
here.
-
I
totally
rebuilt
the
engine
for
you.
Oh,
my
gosh!
This
is
perfect.
Are
you
joking
me?

Sorry.
I
told
you
she'd
love
it.
I'm
down
with
the
kids.
Oh,
yeah,
dude.
You're
the
bomb.
Okay.
Listen,
you
gotta
double-pump
but
besides
that,
you
should
be
good.
-
That's
this
one?
All
right.
Do
you
want
a
ride
to
school
or
something?
I
go
to
school
on
the
reservation.
-
Right,
right.
That's
too
bad.

BELLA:
My
first
day
at
a
new
school.
It's
March,
middle
of
the
semester.

Great.
-
Nice
ride.
Good
one.
You're
Isabella
Swan,
the
new
girl.
Hi,
I'm
Eric,
the
eyes
and
ears
of
this
place.
Anything
you
need,
tour
guide,
I'm
really
kind
of
the
more
Good
headline
for
your
feature.
I'm
on
the
paper,
No,
I'm
not.

You...
Chillax.
No
feature.
-
Okay,
thanks.
GIRL:
All
right.
Okay.
Yeah.

GIRL:
Get
it!
Get
it!
Get
it!

GIRL
1:
To
you!
Whoa!
I'm
sorry.
I
told
them
not
to
let
me
play.
No
way.
No,
no,
no.
You're
Isabella,
right?
Just
Bella.
Yeah.
Hey,
I'm
Mike
Newton.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
-
She's
got
a
great
spike,
huh?
I'm
Jessica,
by
the
way.
Hey,
you're
from
Arizona,
right?
Yeah.
Aren't
people
from
Arizona
Yeah.
Maybe
that's
why
they
kicked
me
out.

You're
good.
That's
so
funny.
-
Back
in,
Jess.
ERIC:
Like
a
masterpiece,
you
know,
we'll
have,
like,
-
and
then
you
guys
can...
-
You
guys
can
give
each
other
high
fives.
-
Hey,
Mikey!
You
met
my
home
girl,
Bella?
Your
home
girl?
-
Yeah.
-
That's...
Sorry
I
had
to
mess
up
your
game,
Mike!
Tyler.

TYLER:
Yes!
Oh,
my
God.
It's
like
first
grade
all
over
again.
Smile.
-
Okay.
I
needed
a
candid
for
the
feature.
The
feature's
dead,
Angela.
Don't
bring
it
up
again.
It's
okay,
I
just...
I
got
your
back,
baby.
Guess
we'll
just
run
another
editorial
You
know,
Speedo
padding
on
the
swim
team.
Actually,
that's
a
good
one.
-
Kirk.
Right?
That's
exactly
what
I
thought.
ANGELA:
We're
talking
Olympic-size.
JESSICA:
There's
no
way.
He's
so
skinny.
-
ANGELA:
Totally.

Who
are
they?
The
Cullens.
They're
Dr.
And
Mrs.
Cullen's
foster
kids.
They
moved
down
here
from
Alaska,
They
kind
of
keep
to
themselves.
Yeah,
'cause
they're
all
together.
Like,
together,
together.
The
blonde
girl,
that's
Rosalie,
and
the
big
dark-haired
guy,
Emmett,
I'm
not
even
sure
that's
legal.
Jess,
they're
not
actually
related.
Yeah,
but
they
live
together.
It's
weird.
And,
okay,
the
little
dark-haired
girl's
Alice.
She's
really
weird,
and
she's
with
Jasper,
the
blond
one
Dr.
Cullen's
like
this
foster
dadlmatchmaker.
Maybe
he'll
adopt
me.
Who's
he?
That's
Edward
Cullen.
He's
totally
gorgeous,
obviously,
but
apparently
nobody
here's
Like
I
care,
you
know?
So,
yeah.
JESSICA:
Seriously,
like,
I
wasn't
planning
on
it.
-
Mr.
Molina.
Oh,
yes.
Miss
Swan.
Hi.
Can
I
have
the
pass?
Thank
you.
Welcome
to
the
class.
And
I
got
a
seat
for
you
right
here,
The
last
one.
All
right,
guys,
today
we
are
gonna
be
aka
flatworms.
So
what
we're
gonna
do...
(MOLINA
CONTINUES
...regenerate.
Zombie
worms.
No
cell
phones.
Guys,
let's
get
to
it.
Gentle,
gentle,
certain
areas.
Please
just
don't
cut
here.
You
won't
believe
this.
Let's
try
to
focus

EDWARD:
There
must
be
something
open.
-
Physics?
Biochem?
Just
a
minute,
dear.
I'm
afraid
you'll
have
to
stay
in
biology.
Fine.
Just...
I'll
just
have
to
endure
it.
I
just
can't
get
over
how
grown
up
you
are.
Hey,
Bella.
You
remember
me?
I
played
Santa
one
year.
Yeah,
Waylon,
she
hasn't
had
I
bet
I
made
an
impression,
though,
didn't
I?
-
You
always
do.
Hey,
kids
love
those
little
bottles,
though.
All
right,
As
soon
as
you're
done,
Berry
cobbler,
remember?
Your
dad
still
has
it.
Every
Thursday.
Thank
you.
That'd
be
great.
CHARLIE:
Here.

Thanks.

RENEE
ON
PHONE:
Hey,
baby.
So,
listen,
we
could
be
moving
to
Florida.
AUTOMATED
VOICE:
Please
insert
$1.25
Mom,
where's
your
cell?
Okay,
don't
laugh.
I
didn't
lose
my
power
cord.
It
ran
away.

Screaming.
I
literally
repel
technology
now.
-
I
miss
you.
But
tell
me
more
about
your
school.
Are
there
any
cute
guys?
Are
they
being
nice
to
you?

Well,
they're
all
very
welcoming.
Tell
me
all
about
it.
It
doesn't
even
matter.
Yes,
it
does,
honey.
I
have
homework
to
do.
I'll
talk
to
you
later.
Okay.
I
love
you.
Love
you,
too.
BELLA:
I
planned
to
confront
him
But
he
never
showed.

Bella!
BELLA:
And
the
next
day,
another
no-show.
More
days
passed.
Things
were
getting
a
little
strange.



-
You
all
right?
Ice
doesn't
really
help
the
uncoordinated.
Yeah.
That's
why
I
had
Old
ones
were
getting
pretty
bald.
Well,
probably
be
late
for
dinner.
Security
guard
at
the
Grisham
Mill
An
animal?
You're
not
in
Phoenix
anymore,
Bells.
Anyway,
I
figured
I'd
lend
a
hand.
-
Be
careful.
-
And
thanks
for
the
tires.

ERIC:
Prom
Committee
is
a
chick
thing,
but
I
gotta
cover
it
for
the
paper
anyway,
and
they
need
a
guy
so
I
need
your
play
list.
Hey,
listen,
I
was
wondering,
What's
up,
Arizona?
Huh?
How
you
liking
the
rain,
girl?
Better
get
used
to
it,
girl.
Yeah,
Mike,
hey,
you're
real
cute,
man.
-
Oh,
I
know...
ERIC:
Why
you
shooting
down
my
game?
MIKE:
Yeah,
okay.
Hello.
I'm
sorry,
I
didn't
get
a
chance
I'm
Edward
Cullen.
You're
Bella?
Yes.
Onion
root
tip
cells,
that's
what's
on
your
slides
right
now.
Okay?
So,
separate
and
label
them
and
the
first
partners
that
get
it
right

BOY:
All
right,
good.
Ladies
first.

You
were
gone.
Yeah.
I
was
out
of
town
for
a
couple
of
days.
Personal
reasons.
Prophase.
Do
you
mind
if
I
look?
It's
prophase.
Like
I
said.
So
are
you
enjoying
the
rain?

What?
You're
asking
me
about
the
weather?
Yeah,
I...
I
guess
I
am.
Well,
I
don't
really
like
the
rain.
Any
cold,
wet
thing,
I
don't
really...
-
What?

It's
anaphase.
-
You
mind
if
I
check?
Anaphase.
Like
I
said.
If
you
hate
the
cold
and
the
rain
so
much,
why'd
you
move
to
the
wettest
place
It's
complicated.
I'm
sure
I
can
keep
up.
My
mom
remarried,
and...
So
you
don't
like
the
guy,
or...
No,
that's
not...
Phil's
really
nice.

It's
metaphase.
You
want
to
check
it?
I
believe
you.
Why
didn't
you
move
Well,
Phil's
a
minor
league
baseball
player,
and
he
travels
a
lot,
and
my
mom
stayed
home
with
me,
so
I
figured
I'd
stay
with
my
dad
for
a
while.
And
now
you're
unhappy.
-
No.
I'm
just
trying
to
figure
you
out.
You're
very
difficult
for
me
to
read.
Hey,
did
you
get
contacts?
No.
Your
eyes
were
black
and
now
they're,
like,
golden
brown.
Yeah,
I
know,
it's
the...
It's
the
fluorescents.





-
ALL:
Bella!

GIRL:
Dial
911!
BOY:
I
already
called.
Bella,
I'm
so
sorry.
I
panicked.
Bella,
I've
got
911
on
the
phone
now.
Bella.
You
okay?
You
and
I
are
gonna
talk.
You
all
right?
I'm
fine,
Dad.
Calm
down.
I'm
sorry,
Bella.
I
tried
to
stop.
I
know.
It's
okay.
No.
It
sure
as
hell
is
not
okay.
Dad,
it
wasn't
his
fault.
You
could've
been
killed.
Yes.
But
I
wasn't,
so...
You
can
kiss
your
license
goodbye.
-
I
heard
the
chief's
daughter
was
here.
Charlie.
I've
got
this
one,
Jackie.
Isabella.
Bella.
Well,
Bella,
looks
like
you
took
quite
a
spill.
Good.
Look
here.
You
might
experience
some
but
your
vitals
look
good.
No
signs
of
any
head
trauma.
I
think
you'll
be
just
fine.
TYLER:
I'm
so
sorry,
Bella.
I'm
really...
You
know,
if
Edward
wasn't
there.
Edward?
Your
boy?
Yeah,
it
was
amazing.
I
mean,
he
got
to
me
so
fast.
Sounds
like
you
were
very
lucky.
Charlie.
I
gotta
go
sign
some
paperwork.
You
should
probably
call
your
mom.
Did
you
tell
her?

She's
probably
just
freaking
out.
ROSALIE:
Fifteen
kids
that
saw
EDWARD:
What
was
I
supposed
to
do,
then?
This
isn't
just
about
you.
It's
about
all
of
us.
CARLISLE:
I
think
we
should
-
Can
I
talk
to
you
for
a
minute?
What?
How
did
you
get
over
to
me
so
fast?
I
was
standing
right
next
to
you,
Bella.
No.
You
were
next
to
your
car,
No,
I
wasn't.

Yes,
you
were.
Bella,
you're...
You
hit
your
head.
I
think
you're
confused.
I
know
what
I
saw.
And
what
exactly
was
that?
You...
You
stopped
the
van.
You
pushed
it
away
with
your
hand.
Well,
nobody's
gonna
believe
you,
so...
I
wasn't
gonna
tell
anybody.
I
just
need
to
know
the
truth.
Can't
you
just
thank
me
and
get
over
it?
Thank
you.
-
You're
not
gonna
let
this
go,
are
you?
Well,
then
I
hope
you
enjoy
disappointment.


BELLA:
And
that
was
the
first
night
I
need
everybody's
permission
slips,
okay?
-
Sammy,
please
collect
them.
Guys,
let's
go.
Come
on,
get
in.
In.
Let's
go!
Look
at
you,
huh?
You're
alive.
-
I
know,
yeah.
False
alarm,
I
guess.
Now,
I
wanted
to
ask
you,
it's
like
a
month
away,
but...

Do
you
wanna
go
to
prom
with
me?
So,
what
do
you
think?
-
About
what?
To
prom?
With
me?

I...
Prom.
Dancing.
Not
such
a
good
idea
for
me.
I
have
something
that
weekend
anyway.
I'm
going
to
Jacksonville
that
weekend.
You
can't
go
another
weekend?
Non-refundable
ticket.
You
should
ask
Jessica.
I
know
she
wants
to
go
with
you.
All
right.
All
right.
MOLINA:
Yo,
yo,
yo.
Hey,
guys,
come
on.
We
gotta
go.
We
gotta
go.
Let's
go.
Guys,
come
on.
Other
bus,
other
bus.
Let's
go.
MOLINA:
Egg
shells,
carrot
tops.
Compost
is
cool.
-
Yes,
sir.
Yes,
sir.
Now,
I
am
gonna
make
a
steaming
cup
-
Okay.
Yeah.
This
is
recycling
Don't
drink
it!
It's
for
the
plants.
What's
in
Jacksonville?
How
did
you
know
about
that?
You
didn't
answer
my
question.
You
don't
answer
any
of
mine,
so...
I
mean,
you
don't
even
say
hi
to
me.
Hi.
Are
you
gonna
tell
me
Yeah.
I
had
an
adrenaline
rush.
It's
very
common.
You
can
Google
it.
Floridians.
That's
what's
in
Jacksonville.
Can
you
at
least
watch
where
you
walk?
Look,
I'm
sorry
I'm
being
rude
all
the
time.
Bella!
Guess
who
just
asked
me
to
prom.
Who?
Yeah,
I
actually
totally
thought
-
It's
not
gonna
be
weird,
though,
right?
-
You
guys
are
great
together.

-
Tyler...
Bella,
look.
It's
a
worm.

It's
a
worm.
Bella,
we
shouldn't
be
friends.
You
really
should've
figured
I
mean,
why
didn't
you
just
and
save
yourself
all
this
regret?
What,
you
think
I
regret
saving
you?
I
can
see
that
you
do.
You
don't
know
anything.
Hi.
Are
you
gonna
be
riding
with
us?
No,
our
bus
is
full.
Your
mom
called.
Again.
Well,
that's
your
fault.
You
shouldn't
have
told
her
Yeah.
Yeah,
I
suppose
you're
right.
She
seems
different.
She
seems
happy.
Phil
sounds
like
an
all
right
guy.
Yeah,
he
is.


All
right.
ERIC:
No,
you
need
the
mitts.
No,
why
do
you
keep
arguing
with
me?
-
ERIC:
You're
gonna
get
frostbite!
ERIC:
Yeah.
Hey!
-
La
Push,
baby.
You
in?
La
Push
Beach
down
at
the
Quileute
Rez.
-
Yeah,
there's
a
big
swell
coming
in.
Eric,
you
stood
up
once,
But
there's
whale
watching,
too.
La
Push,
baby.
It's
La
Push.
Okay,
I'll
go
if
you
stop
saying
that,
okay?
Seriously,
dude.
It's
creepy,
man.
-
What?
That's
what
it's
called.
EDWARD:
Edible
art?
Bella.
Thanks.
You
know,
your
mood
swings
I
only
said
it'd
be
better
not
that
I
didn't
wanna
be.
What
does
that
mean?
It
means
if
you
were
smart,
Okay,
well,
let's
say
for
argument's
sake
-
Would
you
tell
me
the
truth?
I'd
rather
hear
your
theories.
I
have
considered
radioactive
spiders
and
Kryptonite.
That's
all
superhero
stuff,
right?
What
if
I'm
not
the
hero?
You're
not.
I
can
see
what
you're
trying
to
put
off,
but
I
can
see
that
it's
just
It's
a
mask.
Why
don't
we
just
hang
out?
Everybody's
going
to
the
beach.
Come.
I
mean,
have
fun.
-
Which
beach?
I
don't
know.
I
just...
Is
there
something
wrong
with
that
beach?
It's
just
a
little
crowded.

-
Hey,
it's
freezing.
-
I
don't
know
if
it's
worth
it
anymore.
-
JESSICA:
I'm
at
least
paddling
out.
-
She's
right.
So,
I
keep
thinking
that
Eric's
and
then
he
just
doesn't.
You
should
ask
him.
Take
control.
-
I
am?
-
Hey,
will
you
do
me
up?
-
Bella!
-
Guys,
this
is
Jacob.
-
Hi.
What
are
you,
like,
stalking
me?

You're
on
my
rez,
remember?
Are
you
surfing?
-
Definitely
not.
You
guys
should
keep
Bella
company.
What
date?
She
invited
Edward.
-
To
be
polite,
that's
it.
-
Nobody
ever
does.
You
got
that
right.
You
guys
know
him?
The
Cullens
don't
come
here.
What
did
your
friends
mean
about,
You
caught
that,
huh?
I'm
not
really
supposed
Hey,
I
can
keep
a
secret.

Really,
it's
just
like
an
old
scary
story.
Well,
I
want
to
know.
Okay,
did
you
know
Quileutes
What?
Like,
wolves?
-
Yeah.
JACOB:
Well,
that's
the
legend
of
our
tribe.
BELLA:
Okay.
So
what's
the
story
about
the
Cullens?
Well,
they're
supposedly
descended
JACOB:
My
great
grandfather,
the
chief,
But
they
claimed
to
be
something
different,
so
we
made
a
treaty
with
them.
If
they
promised
to
stay
off
Quileute
lands,
then
we
wouldn't
expose
I
thought
they
just
moved
here.
Or
just
moved
back.
Right.
ANGELA:

It
touched
my
hand.
Well,
what
are
they
really?
It's
just
a
story,
Bella.
Come
on,
let's
go.

A
snake!
A
snake!

My
mama
said
I
didn't
know

Hello?
Gerald?
Gerald?

Hello.
Nice
jacket.
Who
are
you?
It's
always
the
same
inane
questions.
"Who
are
you?"
"What
do
you
want?"
"Why
are
you
doing
this?"
James,
let's
not
play
with
our
food.


JESSICA:
He's
not
here.
Whenever
the
weather's
nice,
What,
do
they
just
ditch?
No,
Dr.
And
Mrs.
Cullen
yank
them
out
I
tried
that
out
on
my
parents.
Guys,
I'm
going
to
the
prom
with
Eric.
-
I
just
asked
him.
I
took
control.
Are
you
sure
you
have
to
go
out
of
town?
Oh,
yeah,
it's
a
little
family
thing.
Okay,
we
should
go
shopping
before
all
the
good
dresses
get
cleaned
out.

Port
Angeles?
You
mind
if
I
come?
Yeah,
I
need
your
opinion.
-
I
like
this
one.
But,
like,
I
don't
know
about
-
I
like
this
one.
-
and
you
wouldn't
need
jewelry.
-
Is
that
good?
Is
that
my
color?
I
liked
that
dusty
rose
one,
too.
Okay,
I
like
this
one.
-
Hey.
Nice.
-
ANGELA:
Oh,
God.
That's
disgusting.
Bella,
what
do
you
think?
Yes?
That
looks
great.
You
said
that
about,
like,
I
thought
they
were
all
pretty
good.
You're
not
really
into
this,
are
you?
I
actually
really
just
want
I'll
meet
you
guys
at
the
restaurant?
-
JESSICA:
Are
you
sure?
-
Okay.
She's
right,
though.
This
looks
awesome.

MAN:
There
you
go.
-
Have
a
good
night.
-
BOY:
Saw
you
in
the
dress
store.
BOY:
There
she
is.
-
What's
up?
-
BOY
2:
How
you
guys
doing?
What's
up,
girl?
Hey...
Where
you
going?
-
BOY
3:
Where
are
you
going?
-
Yeah,
you
should
hang
out
with
us.
It's
fun.
-
What's
the
problem?
-
You're
pretty.
-
BOY:
Cute.
Don't
touch
me.



Get
in
the
car.
That
was
a
very
dangerous
maneuver.




I
should
go
back
there
No,
you
shouldn't.
You
don't
know
the
vile,
repulsive
things
And
you
do?
It's
not
hard
to
guess.
Can
you
talk
about
something
else?
You
should
put
your
seatbelt
on.

You
should
put
your
seatbelt
on.
-
I
thought
the
salad
was
pretty
good.
Where
were
you?
We
left
you
messages.
Yeah,
we
waited,
but
we
were,
like,
I'm
sorry
I
kept
Bella
from
dinner.
We
just
sort
of
ran
into
each
other
-
Yeah.
No,
we
totally
understand.
Yeah,
we
were...
-
We
were,
yeah,
we
were
just
leaving.
So...
Bella,
if
you
wanna...
I
think
I
should
make
sure
If
you'd
like.
I'll
drive
you
home
myself.
That's
so
thoughtful.
It's
really
thoughtful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I
should
eat
something.
Yeah.
-
Okay,
so
we'll
see
you
tomorrow.
-
ANGELA:
See
ya.

All
right,
one
mushroom
ravioli.
-
Thanks.
So
are
you
sure
there
isn't
anything
No.
No,
thank
you.
Let
me
know.

You're
really
not
gonna
eat?
No,
I'm
on
a
special
diet.
You
gotta
give
me
some
answers.
Yes,
no.
To
get
to
the
other
side.
1.77245...
I
don't
want
to
know
You
knew
that?
How
did
you
know
where
I
was?
I
didn't.
-
All
right.
Don't
leave.
I...
Did
you
follow
me?
I...
I
feel
very
protective
of
you.
So
you
followed
me.
I
was
trying
to
keep
a
distance
and
then
I
heard
what
those
low-lifes
Wait.
You
say
you
heard
what
they
were
thinking?

So
what,
you...
You
read
minds?
I
can
read
every
mind
in
this
room.
Apart
from
yours.
There's
money,
sex,
money,
sex,
cat.

And
then
you,
nothing.
It's
very
frustrating.
Is
there
something
wrong
with
me?
See,
I
tell
you
I
can
read
minds,
and
you
think
there's

What
is
it?
I
don't
have
the
strength
Then
don't.
Okay,
I
think
I'm
warm
enough
now.

Your
hand
is
so
cold.
BELLA:
Whoa!
What
is
going
on?
My
dad's
still
here.
Can
you
pull
in?
EDWARD:
That's
my
father's
car
on
the
end.
What
is
he
doing
here?
EDWARD:
Carlisle,
what's
going
on?
Waylon
Forge
was
found
in
a
boat
-
I
just
examined
the
body.
-
How?
Was
it
the
same
one
that
Most
likely.
-
Well,
it's
getting
closer
to
town,
then.
Waylon
was
your
father's
friend.
Okay.
I'll
see
you
later.

-
Hey.
Dad,
I'm
really
sorry.
I've
known
him
going
on
30
years.
Don't
worry,
we're
gonna
find
this
thing.
Meantime,
I
want
you
to
carry
this
with
you.
-
I
don't
know
if
you...
Okay.
Let's
go
home.
Cold
One.


You're
impossibly
fast
and
strong.
Your
skin
is
pale
white
and
ice-cold.
Your
eyes
change
color.
And
sometimes
you
speak
You
never
eat
or
drink
anything.

How
old
are
you?
Seventeen.
How
long
have
you
been
17?
A
while.
I
know
what
you
are.
Say
it.
Out
loud.
Say
it.
Vampire.
Are
you
afraid?

No.
Then
ask
me
the
most
basic
question.
What
do
we
eat?
You
won't
hurt
me.
Where
are
we
going?
Up
the
mountain.
Out
of
the
cloud
bank.
You
need
to
see
what

This
is
why
we
don't
show
People
would
know
we're
different.
This
is
what
I
am.

It's
like
diamonds.
You're
beautiful.
Beautiful?
This
is
the
skin
of
a
killer,
Bella.
I'm
a
killer.
I
don't
believe
that.
That's
because
you
believe
the
lie.
It's
camouflage.
I'm
the
world's
most
dangerous
predator.
Everything
about
me
invites
you
in,
my
voice,
my
face,
even
my
smell.
As
if
I
would
need
any
of
that.

As
if
you
could
outrun
me!

As
if
you
could
fight
me
off.
I'm
designed
to
kill.
I
don't
care.
I've
killed
people
before.
It
does
not
matter.
I
wanted
to
kill
you.
I've
never
wanted
a
human's
blood
I
trust
you.
Don't.
I'm
here.
I
trust
you.

My
family,
We
only
hunt
animals.
We've
learned
to
control
our
thirst.
But
it's
you,
your
scent,
it's
like
a
drug
to
me.
You're
like

Why
did
you
hate
me
I
did.
Only
for
making
me
want
you
so
badly.
I
still
don't
know
if
I
can
control
myself.
I
know
you
can.
I
can't
read
your
mind.
You
have
to
tell
me
what
you're
thinking.
Now
I'm
afraid.
Good.
I'm
not
afraid
of
you.
I'm
only
afraid
of
losing
you.
You
don't
know
how
long
So
the
lion
fell
in
love
with
the
lamb.
What
a
stupid
lamb.
What
a
sick,
masochistic
lion.

BELLA:
About
three
things
First,
Edward
was
a
vampire.
Second,
there
was
a
part
of
him,
and
I
didn't
know

That
thirsted
for
my
blood.
And
third,
I
was
unconditionally
and
irrevocably
JESSICA:
Monte
Carlo?
Gambling,
tuxedos,
and
Bond,
James
Bond.

Oh,
my
God.

Wow.

You
know,
everybody's
staring.
Not
that
guy.
No,
he
just
looked.
I'm
breaking
all
the
rules
now
anyway.
Since
I'm
going
to
hell.
So,
does
a
person
have
to
be
dying
to
become
like
you?
No,
that's
just
Carlisle.
He'd
never
do
this
to
someone
So,
how
long
have
you
been
like
this?
Since
1918.
That's
when
Carlisle
found
me
BELLA:
What
was
it
like?

EDWARD:
The
venom
was
excruciating.
But
what
Carlisle
did
was
much
harder.
Not
many
of
us
have
the
restraint
to
do
that.
But
didn't
he
just
have
to
bite?
Not
exactly.
When
we
taste
human
blood,
a
sort
of
frenzy
begins,
and
it's
almost
impossible
to
stop.
BELLA:
But
Carlisle
did.
EDWARD:
First
with
me
So
is
Carlisle
the
real
reason
No,
he's
not
the
only
reason.
I
don't
want
to
be
a
monster.
My
family,
'cause
we
only
survive
But
it's...
It's
like
a
human
only
living
on
tofu.
It
keeps
you
strong,
It
wouldn't
be
like
drinking
your
blood,
Was
it
other
vampires
that
killed
Waylon?
Yeah.
There
are
others
out
there,
Can
the
rest
of
your
family
No.
That's
just
me.
But
Alice
can
see
the
future.
I
bet
she
saw
me
coming.
Alice's
visions
are
subjective.
I
mean,
the
future
can
always
change.

Could
you
act
human?
I'm
gonna
take
you
to
my
place
tomorrow.
Thanks.
-
Wait,
like,
with
your
family?
What
if
they
don't
like
me?
So,
you're
worried
not
because
but
because
you
think
I'm
glad
I
amuse
you.
What
is
it?
Complication.
I'll
pick
you
up
tomorrow.
Hey.
Come
to
visit
your
truck?
Looks
good.
Got
that
dent
out.
-
Yeah.
First
Mariners
game
of
the
season.
Plus
Jacob
here
keeps
bugging
me
about
Great,
Dad.
Thanks.
Just
keeping
it
real,
son.
CHARLIE:
Vitamin
R.
Well
done,
Chief.
Harry
Clearwater's
homemade
fish
fry.
Good
man.
Any
luck
with
that
Waylon
case?
Well,
I
don't
think
it
was
an
animal
Never
thought
it
was.
So
spread
the
word
out
at
the
rez,
huh?
Keep
the
kids
out
of
the
woods.
Will
do.
Don't
want
no
one
else
getting
hurt,
do
we?


Whoa.
This
is
incredible.
It's
so
light
and
open,
you
know?
What
did
you
expect,

No,
not
the
moats.
Not
the
moats.
This
is
the
one
place
we
don't
have
to
hide.

I
told
them
not
to
do
this.
MAN
ON
TV:
You
add
a
little
bit
of
olive
oil
and
you
want
to
cook
What
I
do,
I
cut
this
in
strips,
-
Is
she
even
Italian?
I'm
sure
she'll
love
it,
no
matter
what.
ROSALIE:

Get
a
whiff
of
that.

Here
comes
the
human.
Bella,
we're
making
Italiano
for
you.
Bella,
this
is
Esme.

You've
given
us
an
excuse
I
hope
you're
hungry.
-
Yeah,
absolutely.
Perfect.
Yeah,
it's
just
because
Of
course.
It's
very
considerate
of
you.
-
Just
ignore
Rosalie.
I
do.
Let's
just
keep
pretending
I
would
never
tell
anybody
anything.
She
knows
that.
Yeah,
well,
the
problem
is,
Emmett.
No,
she
should
know.
The
entire
family
Badly,
as
in...
I
would
become
the
meal.


Hi,
Bella.
I'm
Alice.
-
Hi.
You
do
smell
good.
Alice,
what
are
you...
It's
okay.
CARLISLE:
Sorry,
It's
a
little
difficult
for
him.
It's
a
pleasure
to
meet
you.
It's
okay,
Jasper.
You
won't
hurt
her.
All
right,
I'm
gonna
take
you
-
Okay.
Okay.
-
Cute!
I
think
that
went
well.
Clean
this
up.
Now.
Was
that
as
weird
for
you
as
it
was
for
me?
I
don't
know.
Graduation
caps?
Yeah.
It's
a
private
joke.
We
matriculate
a
lot.
That's
kind
of
miserable.
I
mean,
repeating
high
school
True,
but
the
younger
we
start
out
the
longer
we
can
stay
there.
Come
on.
Yeah,
this
is
my
room.

No
bed?
No,
I
don't...
I
don't
sleep.
-
Ever?

Okay.
Boy,
you
have
so
much
music.
What
are
you
listening
to?


It's
Debussy.
-
I
don't
know...
Claire
De
Lune
is
great.
-
What?


Well,
I
could
always
make
you.
I'm
not
scared
of
you.
Well,
you
really
shouldn't
have
said
that.

You
better
hold
on
tight,
spider
monkey.

Do
you
trust
me?
In
theory.
Then
close
your
eyes.
What?

This
isn't
real.
This
kind
of
stuff
just
doesn't
exist.
It
does
in
my
world.




MAN:
Hold
up.
It's
human.
Arizona.
Yo,
what's
happening?
So
you
and
Cullen,
huh?
That's...
I
don't
like
it.
I
mean,
I
don't
know,
he
just
looks
at
you
Here's
your
veggie
plate,
Stephenie.
Hey,
sorry
I'm
late.
Biology
project.
I
ordered
you
the
spinach
salad.
You
should
order
one
for
yourself
next
time.
Cut
back
on
the
steak.
Hey,
I'm
as
healthy
as
a
horse.
Say,
Chief,
boys
want
to
know,
did
you
find
anything
Yeah,
we
found
a
bare
human
footprint,
but
it
looks
like
whoever
that
is,
so
Kitsap
County
sheriff
is
gonna
take
-
CORA:
Okay.
I
just
hope
they
catch
him
fast.
Looks
like
your
friends
are
flagging
you.
It's
okay
if
you
wanna
go
join
them.
I'm
just
gonna
turn
in
early
anyway.
Me,
too.
Bella,
it's
Friday
night.
Go
out.
Looks
like
the
Newton
boy's
Yeah,
he's
a
good
buddy.
What
about
any
of
these
Anybody
interest
you?
Dad,
we
gonna
talk
about
boys?
Yeah,
I
guess
not.
I
just
feel
like
I
leave
you
alone
too
much.
You
should
be
around
people.
I
don't
really
mind
being
alone.
I
guess
I'm
kind
of
like
my
dad
in
that
way.
So,
how's
all
the
baseball
stuff
going?
Phil's
working
so
hard.
You
know,
spring
training.
We're
looking
for
a
house
to
rent
You'd
like
Jacksonville,
baby.
Yeah?
I'm
really
liking
Forks.
What?
Forks
is
growing
on
me.
Could
a
guy
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
Well,
yeah.
I
knew
it.
Tell
me
everything.
I
bet
he's
smart.
Is
he
smart?
Mom,
can
I
talk
to
you
later?
Come
on,
we
gotta
talk
boys.
How
did
you
get
in
here?
The
window.
Do
you
do
that
a
lot?
Well,
just
the
past
couple
of
months.
I
like
watching
you
sleep.
It's
kind
of
fascinating
to
me.
I
always
want
to
try
one
thing.
Just
stay
very
still.
Don't
move.



Stop
it!
I'm
sorry.
I'm
stronger
than
I
thought.
Yeah.
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same.
I
can't
ever
lose
control
with
you.
Hey,
don't
go.

-
Hey,
got
you
another
one.
I
have
a
date
with
Edward
Cullen.
He's
a
little
old
for
you,
isn't
he?
No.
He's
a
junior.
I'm
a
junior.
I
thought
you
liked
the
Cullens.
I
thought
you
didn't
like
Edward
doesn't
live
in
town.
Technically.
He's
right
outside.
He
is?
Yeah,
he
wanted
to
meet
you,
officially.
All
right.
Bring
him
in.
Could
you
be
nice?
He's
important.
Chief
Swan.
I
want
to
formally
introduce
myself.
Hi,
Edward.
Bella
won't
be
out
too
late
tonight.
She's
just
gonna
play
baseball
Baseball?
Yes,
sir,
that's
the
plan.

Bella's
gonna
play
baseball.
Well,
good
luck
with
that.
I'll
take
good
care
of
her.
I
promise.
Hey.
Still
got
that
pepper
spray?

Yeah,
Dad.
And
since
when
do
vampires
like
baseball?
Well,
it's
the
American
pastime,
and
there's
a
thunderstorm
coming.
It's
the
only
time
we
can
play.
Hey.
Glad
you're
here.
We
need
an
umpire.
She
thinks
we
cheat.
I
know
you
cheat.
-
Call
them
as
you
see
them,
Bella.

It's
time.

Okay,
now
I
see
why
you
need
the
thunder.
That's
gotta
be
a
home
run,
right?
Edward's
very
fast.

Ooh,
baby,
Ooh,
baby,
I'm
a
fool
for
you
Come
home,
Rosalie!
-
You're
out.
Babe,
come
on.
It's
just
a
game.
You
set
my
soul
alight
Nice
kitty.
Ooh
You
set
my
soul
alight
Ooh
You
set
my
soul
alight
Ooh
You
set
my
soul
alight
What
are
you
doing?
Super
massive
black
hole
Super
massive
black
hole
Super
massive
black
hole
Super
massive
black
hole
My
monkey
man.

Stop!

They
were
leaving.
Then
they
heard
us.
-
Let's
go.
Get
your
hair
down.
Like
that'll
help.
I
shouldn't
have
brought
you
here.
-
What?
What
are
you...

I
believe
this
belongs
to
you.
Thank
you.
I
am
Laurent.
And
this
is
Victoria
and
James.
I'm
Carlisle.
This
is
my
family.
Hello.
I'm
afraid
your
hunting
activities
Our
apologies.
We
didn't
realize
the
territory
Yes,
well,
we
maintain
Really?
Well,
we
won't
be
a
problem
anymore.
We
were
just
passing
through.
The
humans
were
tracking
us,
You
should
be
safe.
Excellent.
So,
could
you
use
three
more
players?
Come
on.
Just
one
game.
Sure.
Why
not?
A
few
of
us
were
leaving.
We'll
bat
first.
I'm
the
one
with
the
wicked
curveball.
Well,
I
think
we
can
handle
that.
We
shall
see.



You
brought
a
snack.

LAURENT:
A
human?
CARLISLE:
The
girl
is
with
us.
I
think
it
best
if
you
leave.
I
can
see
the
game
is
over.
We'll
go
now.
James.
CARLISLE:
Get
Bella
out
of
here.
Go.
Okay,
I've
got
it!
I've
got
it!
I'm
all
right!
What,
now
he's
coming
after
me?
Listen
to
me.
James
is
a
tracker.
I
read
his
mind.
I
just
made
this
his
most
exciting
game
ever.
-
He's
never
gonna
stop.
We
have
to
kill
him.
-
Where
we
going?
-
We'll
get
a
ferry
to
Vancouver.
-
You
have
to
take
me
home.
He's
just
gonna
trace
your
scent
there.
-
But
my
dad
is
there.
We...
Yes,
it
does!
Just
let
me
get
you
out
of
here
first,
It's
my
dad!
We
have
to
go
back!
We'll
figure
a
way
I
don't
know.
But
we
have
to
do
something.

-
Edward,
I
said
leave
me
alone.
It's
over!
Get
out!
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
Bella?
What's
going
on?
I
just
gotta
get
out
of
here.
I'm
leaving
now.
Hey.

CHARLIE:
Bella?
What
am
I
gonna
say
to
him?
I
can't
hurt
him.
-
Bella,
what's
going
on?
I'll
be
down
at
the
truck.
Did
he
hurt
you?
No.
Break
up
with
you
or
something?
No,
I
broke
up
with
him.
I
thought
you
liked
him.
Yeah,
that's
why
I
have
to
leave.
I
don't
want
this.
I
have
to
go
home.
Home?
Your...
CHARLIE:
Your
mom's
not
even
in
Phoenix.
BELLA:
She'll
come
home.
You're
not
gonna
drive
home
right
now.
You
can
sleep
on
it.
-
I'll
take
you
to
the
airport.
It'll
give
me
more
time
to
think.
I
mean,
if
I
get
really
tired,
Look,
Bella,
I
know
I'm
not
but
I
can
change
that.
Like
what?
Like
watch
baseball
on
the
flat-screen?
Eat
at
the
diner
every
night?
Dad,
that's
you.
That's
not
me.
Bella,
come
on,
I
just...
I
just
got
you
back.
Yeah,
and,
you
know,
if
I
don't
get
out
now,
then
I'm
just
gonna
be
stuck
here
like
Mom.

Your
father's
gonna
forgive
you.
Why
don't
you
let
me
drive?
He
won't.
You
should've
seen
his
face.
I
told
him
the
same
thing
when
she
was
leaving
him.
It's
the
only
way
he'd
let
you
go.
Just
don't
worry
about
him
now.


-
Oh,
God.
Alice
is
in
the
car
behind
us.

CARLISLE:
Wait.
He
came
to
warn
us
about
James.
This
isn't
my
fight,
but
he's
got
unparalleled
senses,
I've
never
seen
anything
like
him
And
the
woman,
Victoria,
I've
had
to
fight
our
kind
before.
-
They're
not
easy
to
kill.
We'll
tear
them
apart
and
burn
the
pieces.
I
don't
relish
the
thought
even
a
sadistic
one
like
James.
-
What
if
he
kills
one
of
us
first?
Can
you
lead
the
tracker
away
from
here?
No,
Edward.
-
He'll
follow
you.
Jasper
and
I
will
drive
her
south.
I'll
keep
her
safe,
Edward.
-
Can
you
keep
your
thoughts
to
yourself?
Rosalie,
Esme,
could
you
put
these
on
Why?
What
is
she
to
me?
Rosalie,
Bella
is
with
Edward.
She's
part
of
this
family
now,
and
we
protect
our
family.
Oh,
God.
If
anything...
What
if...
If
anything
happens,
I
swear
to
God...
Nothing's
gonna
happen.
There's
seven
of
us,
and
when
everything's
done,
Yeah.
Bella,
you
are
my
life
now.

Hey,
Mom.
It's
me
again.
You
must
have
let
your
phone
die
I'm
not
in
Forks,
but
everything's
okay,
EDWARD:
Rosalie,
mark
the
tree.
That's
good.



What
is
it?
What
do
you
see?


He's
figured
it
out.
The
tracker,
he
just
changed
course.
-
Where
will
it
take
him,
Alice?
A
room
full
of
mirrors.
Edward
said
the
visions
JASPER:
She
sees
the
course
people
If
they
change
their
minds,
Okay,
so
the
course
that
is
gonna
lead
him
to
a
ballet
studio?
-
You've
been
here?
The
school
I
went
to
Was
your
school
here
in
Phoenix?
Yeah.

-
Edward,
are
you
okay?
The
woman's
still
in
the
area.
Rosalie
and
Esme
are
going
back
I'm
coming
to
get
you.
Then
you
and
I
And
the
others
will
keep
hunting.
I'll
do
whatever
it
takes

Hey,
Mom,
I'm
glad
you
got
my
message.
What
are
you
doing
home?
Bella?
Bella?
Bella,
where
are
you?
-
Calm
down,
everything's
fine.
I'll
explain
everything
later.
Mom,
are
you
there?
JAMES:
Forks
High
School
doesn't
protect
It
was
just
too
easy
for
Victoria
It's
a
nice
house
you
have
here.
I
was
prepared
to
wait
for
you,
but
then
Mom
came
home
after
she
received
and
it
all
worked
out
quite
well.
RENEE:
Wait,
wait...
Don't
touch
her!
Don't...
-
You
can
still
save
her.
But
you're
gonna
have
to
get
away
-
Can
you
handle
that?
How
about
your
old
ballet
studio?
And
I'll
know
if
you
bring
anyone
along.
Poor
Mommy
would
BELLA:
I'd
never
given
much
thought
But
dying
in
the
place
of
someone
I
love
I
can't
bring
myself
to
regret
the
decisions
They
also
brought
me
to
Edward.
RENEE:
Bella?
Bella?
Bella,
where
are
you?
-
Mom?
-
Mom?
RENEE:
What
are
you
doing
in
here?
YOUNG
BELLA:
Everyone
makes
fun
of
me.
Come
on,
you're
a
wonderful
dancer.
Mom,
I
suck.

You
do
not
suck.
That's
my
favorite
part.
You
were
a
stubborn
child,
weren't
you?
-
She's
not
even
here.
JAMES:
Sorry.
You
know,
but
you
really
made
it
too
easy.
So
to
make
things
more
entertaining,
I'm
gonna
make
a
little
film
I
borrowed
this
from
your
house.
Good.
And
action.
That'll
break
Edward's
little
heart.
You
have...
But
he
does.
His
rage
will
make
for
more
interesting
sport
than
his
feeble
attempt
to
protect
you.
And
let's
continue.





Beautiful.
Very
visually
dynamic.
I
chose
my
stage
well.
It's
too
bad
he
didn't
have
Instead,
he
kept
you
It's
cruel,
really.

Tell
Edward
how
much
it
hurts.
Tell
him
to
avenge
you.
Tell
him!
-
No,
Edward,
don't!



You're
alone
But
not
stronger.
I'm
strong
enough
to
kill
you.

I'm
sorry.










Bella,
Bella,
it's
okay.
Son.
Enough.
Remember
who
you
are.

ALICE:
Bella,
you're
okay.
Bella
needs
you.
It's
okay.
Oh,
God.
Carlisle?
Her
blood.
-
Your
brothers
will
take
care
of
him.
-
ALICE:
Carlisle!
EMMETT:
Get
the
floorboards.
-
JASPER:
Alice!
Her
femoral
artery's
been
severed.
No,
no,
my
head
is
burning!
It's
the
venom.
You
have
to
make
a
choice.
No.
No.
-
It's
gonna
happen,
Edward.
I've
seen
it.
She's
still
hemorrhaging.
Carlisle,
what's
my
other
option?

Tie
it
above
my
hands.
Carlisle!
Go.
-
We
could
try
to
suck
the
venom
out.
Then
find
the
will
to
stop.
But
choose.
She
only
has
minutes
left.
I'm
gonna
make
it
go
away,
Bella.

I'm
gonna
make
it
go
away.




Edward,
stop.
Edward.
Stop.

Stop.
Find
the
will.

BELLA:
Death
is
peaceful,
easy.
Life
is
harder.
Bella?
Baby?

Bella.
-
Mom?
Where
is
he?
Where's...
Where's
Edward?
He's
asleep.
He
never
leaves.
And
your
dad,
he's
down
at
the
cafeteria.
What
happened?
Well,
when
you
fell,
you
broke
your
leg,
and
you
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
You
don't
remember
any
of
this,
do
you?
Edward
came
down
with
his
dad
to
try
to
convince
you
So
you
went
over
to
their
hotel,
and
you
fell
down
two
flights
of
stairs.
Went
through
a
window.
Yeah,
that
sounds
like
me.
Oh,
honey,
I'm
so
sorry.

It's
Phil.
He's
so
worried
about
you.
You're
texting.

Finally,
yeah.
I
told
him
to
stay
down
in
Florida.
Honey,
you
are
gonna
love
Jacksonville.
and
we
found
the
cutest
little
house,
Mom,
I
still
want
to
live
in
Forks.
What?
I
want
to
live
in
Forks.
Well,
okay,
but
we'll
talk
about
it.
Do
you
mind
getting
Dad?
I
have
to
talk
to
him.
Apologize.
Okay,
baby.
I'll
go
get
him.
-
And
I'll
go
get
a
nurse,
okay?
So
what
happened?
Where's
James?
We
took
care
of
it.
And
the
woman,
Victoria,
she
ran
off.
I'm
alive
because
of
you.
No,
you're
in
here
because
of
me.
The
worst
part
of
it
was
that
I
thought
I
wasn't
gonna
be
able
to
stop.
You
did
stop.
Bella,
you
gotta
go
to
Jacksonville
What?
Are
you...
No!
No!
I
don't
even
know
what
you're...
How...
What
are
you
talking
about?
No,
I
can't...
I
can't
just
leave
you...
I
know.
We
can't
be
apart.
You
can't
leave
me.
I'm
here.
Okay,
just
don't...
You
just
can't
say
stuff
like
that
to
me.
Ever.
Where
else
am
I
gonna
go?


Alice
lent
me
the
dress.
The
cast
is...
You're
perfect.
I'll
take
care
of
her,
Chief
Swan.
I've
heard
that
before.
All
right,
Bells.
I
put
a
new
can
of
pepper
spray
in
your
bag.
Dad.
And...
Well,
you
look
beautiful.
Thanks.
See
you.
Hey.
I'll
be
right
back.
-
Bella.
Hey.
-
Nice.
Are
you
crashing
the
prom
or
something?
No.
My
dad
paid
me
to
come
talk
to
you.

Twenty
bucks.
Let's
hear
it.
Just
don't
get
mad,
okay?
He
wants
you
to
break
up
It's
just,
he
said,
quote,
"We'll
be
watching
you."

-
Okay,
well,
tell
him,
"Thanks."
-
And
to
pay
up.
Jacob.
I'll
take
it
from
here.
Guess
I'll
see
you
around,
Bella.
All
right.
I
leave
you
alone
for
two
minutes,
-
I
can't
believe
you're
making
me
do
this.
Tonight!
Lightning
Strikes!
Don't
go
stay
tonight!
Wow.
You
are
really
trying
to
kill
me.
The
prom
is
an
important
rite
of
passage.
Oh.

Everyday
we're
going
all
the
way
Everyday,
everyday,
everyday
Tonight!
Lightning
Strikes!
Bella,
hey!
-
Do
you
want
to
go?
DJ:
All
right,
slowing
it
down.

Shall
we?
You're
serious?
Why
not.

Wide
on
my
plastic
toys
Then
when
the
cops
closed
the
fair
I
cut
my
long
baby
hair
Stole
me
a
dog-eared
map
See,
you're
dancing.
At
prom.
Have
I
found
you
Flightless
bird
Jealous
Weeping
Edward,
why
did
you
save
me?
If
you
just
let
the
venom
spread,
I
could
be
like
you
by
now.
You
don't
know
what
you're
saying.
-
You
don't
want
this.
Always.
I'm
not
gonna
end
your
life
for
you.
I'm
dying
already.
Every
second,
I
get
closer.
Older.
That's
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be.
Alice
said
that
she
saw
me
like
you.
-
I
heard
her.
Yeah,
based
on
what
people
decide.
I've
decided.
So
that's
what
you
dream
about.
Becoming
a
monster.
I
dream
about
being
with
you
forever.
Forever?
And
you're
ready
right
now?
Yes.
Bleeding
or
lost
you
American
mouth
Big
pill
Is
it
not
enough
Yeah.
For
now.
BELLA:
No
one
will
surrender
tonight,
but
I
won't
give
in.
I
know
what
I
want.
Have
I
found
you
Flightless
bird
Grounded
Bleeding
or
lost
you
American
mouth

How
come
I
end
up
where
I
started
How
come
I
end
up
where
I
went
wrong
Won't
take
my
eyes
off
the
ball
again
You
reel
me
out
then
you
cut
the
string
How
come
I
end
up
where
I
started
How
come
I
end
up
where
I
went
wrong
Won't
take
my
eyes
off
the
ball
again
First
you
reel
me
out
You
used
to
be
all
right
What
happened?
Did
the
cat
get
your
tongue
Did
your
string
come
undone
One
by
one
One
by
one
It
comes
to
us
all
It's
as
soft
as
your
pillow

I
dreamed
I
was
missing
You
were
so
scared
But
no
one
would
listen
'Cause
no
one
else
cared
After
my
dreaming
I
woke
with
this
fear
What
am
I
leaving
When
I'm
done
here?
So
if
you're
asking
me
I
want
you
to
know
When
my
time
comes
Forget
the
wrong
that
I've
done
Help
me
leave
behind
some
Reasons
to
be
missed
Don't
resent
me
And
when
you're
feeling
empty
Keep
me
in
your
memory
Leave
out
all
the
rest
Leave
out
all
the
rest
Forgetting
all
the
hurt
inside
You've
learned
to
hide
so
well
Pretending
someone
else
can
come
And
save
me
from
myself
I
can't
be
who
you
are
When
my
time
comes
Forget
the
wrong
that
I've
done
Help
me
leave
behind
some
Reasons
to
be
missed
Don't
resent
me
And
when
you're
feeling
empty
Keep
me
in
your
memory
Leave
out
all
the
rest
Leave
out
all
the
rest
Forgetting
all
the
hurt
inside
You've
learned
to
hide
so
well
Pretending
someone
else
can
come
And
save
me
from
myself
I
can't
be
who
you
are
I
can't
be
who
you
are

How
can
I
decide
what's
right
When
you're
clouding
up
my
mind
I
can't
win
your
losing
fight
All
the
time
How
can
I
ever
own
what's
mine
When
you're
always
taking
sides
But
you
won't
take
away
my
pride
No,
not
this
time
No,
not
this
time
How
did
we
get
here?
When
I
used
to
know
you
so
well
But
how
did
we
get
here?
I
think
I
know
The
truth
is
hiding
in
your
eyes
And
its
hanging
on
your
tongue
Just
boiling
in
my
blood
But
you
think
that
I
can't
see
What
kind
of
man
that
you
are
If
you're
a
man
at
all
Well,
I
will
figure
this
one
out
on
my
own
I'm
screaming
I
love
you
so
My
thoughts
you
can't
decode
How
did
we
get
here?
When
I
used
to
know
you
so
well
Yeah
Well,
I
think
I
know
how
Do
you
see
what
we've
done
We're
gonna
make
such
fools
of
ourselves
How
did
we
get
here?
When
I
used
to
know
you
so
well
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah
How
did
we
get
here?
When
I
used
to
know
you
so
well
I
think
I
know
There
is
something
I
see
in
you
It
might
kill
me
I
want
it
to
be
true
