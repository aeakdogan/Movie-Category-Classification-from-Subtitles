The
boy,
Tom
Hansen
grew
up
believing
that
until
the
day
he
met
"the
one."
This
belief
stemmed
from
early
and
a
total
misreading


did
not
share
this
belief.
Since
the
disintegration
she'd
only
loved
two
things.
The
first
was
her
long
dark
hair.
The
second
was
how
easily
and
feel
nothing.
Tom
meets
Summer
on
January
8.
He
knows
almost
immediately
This
is
a
story
of
boy
meets
girl.
But
you
should
know
up
front
this
is
not
a
love
story.

They
made
a
statue
of
us
#
#
And
put
it
on
a
mountaintop
#
#
Now
tourists
come
and
stare
at
us
#
#
Blow
bubbles
with
their
gum
#
#
Take
photographs
of
fun
#
#
Have
fun
#
#
They'll
name
a
city
after
us
#
#
And
later
say
it's
all
our
fault
#
#
Then
they'll
give
us
a
talking
to
#
#
'Cause
they've
got
years
of
experience

So

No.

That's
fine.
I

But,
you

I
just-

I
need
to

Shh.
well,
what
about
you?
Well,
of
course.
Yeah.
No.
Because
it's
not

I'm
interested.

All
right.
Fine.
Yeah.
I
can
take

Well,
in

No.
He

He

was
nice,
but-
And
then
there
was

Also
known
as
"The
Puma."

The

So-
Oh,
that's
it?
What
happened?
Why-
What
always

No,
it's
not.
I'm

I'll
go

Shh.
Everyone's
Are
you
done?
You're
done?
This
is
too
much.
Promise?
I
promise.


It's
very
complex.
In
a
way,
it
sort

so
much...
by...
saying
so
little.
Do

T-Tom?
Mr.

to

Have

Has
something
happened
What
do
you
mean?
A
death
in
the

No.
Look,
I
don't
mean
to
pry,
but...
does
this
have
something
to
do
Who?
Your,
um-
Never
mind.
The
reason
I'm
asking
is,
has
been...
a
little
off.
I'm
not
following.
Um,
here's
something
Uh,
"Roses
are
red,
Fuck
you,
whore."
Now,
most
shoppers
Mr.
Vance,
are
you
firing
me?
Relax,
Hansen.
Okay.
Uh,
yeah,
I'm
sorry.
Things
have
been
a
little
difficult.
That's
okay.
I
completely
I'm
just
saying
um,
into
something
like
this.
Funerals
and
sympathy.
Misery,
sadness,
loss
of

no
reason
to
live.
This
is
perfect
for
you.
Uh-
Now
back

you.
Hey.

That's
it.
How
'bout,
"Every

Shit,
that's

Have
you
tried

Wow!
That's

Merry!
We've

Hmm.
How
about...
"I
love
us"?
Aw.
I
hate
Summer.
I
hate
her
crooked
teeth.
I
hate
her
1960s
haircut.
I
hate
her
knobby
knees.
And
I
hate
her
cockroach-shaped
I
hate
the
way
she
smacks
her
lips
And
I
hate
the
way
she
sounds

I
hate
this

Hmm?
Listen,
it's
great
to
meet
you,
and...
you're
a
very
attractive

I
just
wanted
to
say
up

It's
not
gonna
go
anywhere.
I
liked
this
girl.
What
does
she
do?
She
took
a
giant
shit
Literally.
Not
literally.
What's
the
matter
with
you?
The
point
is,
I'm
messed
up.
I
am.
You
know,
on
the
one
hand,
On
the
other
hand,
I
know
that
she's
the
only
person
Mm-hmm.
You
think
back
on
the
times
and
you
look
for
those
There's
two
options
really.
Either...
she's
an
evil,
emotionless,
or...
she's
a
robot.
Small
Wonder.
That
would
explain
Yeah.
No.
Never.
No.
And
she
told
you
up

Yeah.
I
got
a
great

from

No.

Maybe

Probably-
But,

She's

They're

You
just
do
what
you
want,
You
never
wanted
to
be
and
now
you're
somebody's
wife.
Surprised
me
too.
I
don't
think
I'll
ever
I
mean,
It
just
happened.
Right,
but
that's
what
I
just-
I
just
woke
up
one
day,
Knew
what?
What
I
was
never
sure
of
with
you.
You
know
what
sucks?
Realizing
that
everything
It
sucks.
Uh,
you
know,
destiny,
and
all
that
childhood
You
were
right.
No.
Tom.
What
are
you
looking
at
me
Well,
you
know,
I
guess
it's
'cause...
I
was
sitting
in
a
deli
and...
a
guy
comes
up
to
me...
and
asked
me
about
it,
and...
now
he's
my
husband.
Yeah.
And...
so?
So,
what
if
I'd
gone
to
the
movies?
What
if
I
had
gone
What
if
I'd
gotten
there
It
was-
It
was
meant
to
be.
And
I
just
kept
thinking,
Tom
was
right.
Yeah,
I
did.

It
just
wasn't
me
I
should
go.
But
I'm
really
happy
to
see
##

Summer!
I
really
do
hope

They
begin
and
they
end...
with
no
lasting
memories
Most
days
have
no
impact...
on
the
course
of
a
life.
May
23
was
a
Wednesday.
Are
you
interviewing?
Are
you
interviewing
Oh,
yeah.
why?
Are
you?
Mm-hmm.
My
competition.
It
would
appear.
Yeah.
So,
a
little
awkward.
Yeah.
Well,
I
hope
you,
um,
Well,
I
hope
you

Have
I
seen
you
before?
Me?
I
don't
think
so.
Do
you
ever
go
Yes.
That's,
like,
Yeah.
Okay.
Except
for
Yeah.
I-
I
agree.
I
think
I've
seen
you
there.
Yeah.
You
must
not

it
was
that
you
can't
ascribe
to
a
simple
earthly
event.
Coincidence.
Nothing
more
than
coincidence.

Come
on
back.
Tom
had
finally
learned
There's
no
such
thing
as
fate.
Nothing
is
meant
to
be.
He
knew.
He
was
sure
of
it
now.
Tom
was-
I
just
left,
uh-

-
Hey.
Yeah.
I,
uh,
was
just
wondering...
if
maybe
after
this,
if,
um,
you-
you
want
to
get
some
coffee
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sort
of
supposed
to
Okay.
Sure.
What's
that?
Okay.
Well,
then
I'll
just,
uh-
We-
We'll
figure
it
out.
-
My
name's
Tom.
