This
is
not
at
all
I
thought
we
were
going
to
see
the
Arno.
The
signora
distinctly
wrote...
south
rooms
with
a
view
instead
of
which
she
has
given
us
and
a
long
way
apart.

Tsk.
We
must
hurry
and
get
dressed,
dear...
or
we'll
miss
our
dinner,
She
had
no
business
to
do
it.
No
business
at
all.
Any
nook
does
for
me,
but
it
does
seem
No,
you
must
have
a
view
too.
-
Buonasera.
Miss
Lavish,
what
a
recommendation
Indeed,
Miss
Alan,
Between
the
squalor
of
London
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed.
It
is
only
by
going
off
the
track
See
the
little
towns...
Gubbio,
Settignano...
Galluzzo...
San
Gimignano,
Monteriggioni.
They're
a
mixture
of
the
almost
primitive
that
I
find
irresistible.
-
Miss
Pole?
What
is
that
you're
taking?
Yes,
it
is
lemonade.
Put
it
away,
Miss
Pole.
Right
away.
Lemonade
is
nothing
but
acidity.
Oh!
I
shall
tell
the
signora...
that
the
next
south
room
view
available
-
Why
not
to
you,
surely?
This
meat
has
surely
been
boiled...
-

It's
lost
all
its
flavor.
Monteriggioni
is
not
only
quaint...
but
there
one
meets
in
all
their
simplicity
and
charm.
Wasn't
Monteriggioni
An
entire
carpet
of
them.
Oh,
it
was
delightful.
I
find
the
cornflower
Don't
you,
Miss
Lavish?
I
prefer
something
bolder...
the
reckless
rose...
the
tempestuous
tulip.
Your
mother
would
never
forgive
me
Mother
would
want
you
to
have
it.
On
no
account.
I
don't
know
why
we're
arguing,
-
We
have
no
view.
I
have
a
view.
And
so
does
George.
My
son
George
here.
You
can
have
our
rooms,
We
can
change.
But
why
shouldn't
you
have
them?
Thank
you
very
much
indeed.
We
could
not
impose
on
your
kindness.
Why?
-
You
see,
we
wouldn't...
Women
like
looking
at
a
view.
Men
don't.
George,
persuade
them.
It's
obvious
they
should
have
the
rooms.
-
Signora?
Why
shouldn't
you
change?
We
could
It's
ridiculous,
these
niceties.
They
go
against
common
sense.
I
don't
care
what
I
see
outside.
Here
is
where
the
birds
sing.
Come,
Lucy.
Oh,
let
them
have
their
view
Why
shouldn't
they,
if
they
want
it?
George,
go
after
them.
What
an
impossible
person.

-
He
meant
to
be
kind.
I
know
how
to
deal
with
these
people.
Charlotte,
you
dealed
rudely.

This
pensione
is
a
failure.
Tomorrow
we'll
make
a
change.
-
It's
Mr.
Beebe.
Charlotte,
we
can't
change
now.
-
Mr.
Beebe.
Miss
Bartlett
and
Miss
Honeychurch.
-
We
met
at
Tunbridge
Wells.
How
do
you
do?
How
do
you
do?
I've
heard
from
Mother
Yes,
I
move
into
the
rectory
We
did
feel
so
sorry
for
you
Mr.
Emerson
is
so
tactless.
But
he
meant
to
be
kind.
This
old
gentleman
and
his
son
offered
us
which
have
no
view.
It
was
most
indelicate.
But
things
that
are
indelicate
LUCY:
Yes!
I
am
the
chaperone
It
would
be
a
serious
thing
if
I
were
to
people
of
whom
I
know
nothing.
I
don't
think
much
harm
There,
Charlotte.
So
you
think
I
ought
to
have
accepted?
You
think
I
have
been
narrow-minded.
I
never
suggested
that.
If
you
will
allow
me,
I
would
be
happy
with
Mr.
Emerson.
I
do
not
think
he
would
take
advantage
nor
expect
any
gratitude.
He
has
rooms
he
does
not
value
Charlotte,
please.
My
own
wishes,
dearest
Lucy,
I
am
only
here
through
your
kindness.
If
you
want
me
to
turn
these
gentlemen
Would
you
then,
Mr.
Beebe...
kindly
tell
Mr....
Emerson.
Emerson...
we
accept
his
offer?
I
would
like
to
thank
your
father
You
can't.
He's
in
his
bath.
I
would
have
given
but
I
happen
to
know
In
my
small
way,
and
I
know
where
things
can
lead
to.
Whatever
does
it
mean?


Oh,
Lucy.
Get
dressed,

Well,

I'd
like
to

May
I

something

Oh,
Mr.
Beebe,
Don't

If
I
were,
you

Won't

No,

Mr.

Hello,
Mr.
Vyse.
I've
come
for
some
tea.
Do
you
suppose
I
shall
get
it?
Food
is
the
one
thing

get
here.
Yes.
What
an
extraordinary
thing.
One
of
Freddy's

Oh,

terrible.
A
most
unpromising
youth.
So
unlike
his
sister.
You
think
his
sister
is
promising?
I
have
a
pet
theory
Does
it
not
strike
you
as
odd
play
Beethoven
with
such
passion,
I
suspect
that
one
day...
music
and
life
will
mingle.
Then
she
will
be
wonderful
in
both.
I
trust
that
day
is
at
hand.
She
has
just
promised
to
marry
me.
I'm
sorry
if
I've
given
you
a
shock.
I
really
am
most
awfully
sorry.
I'd
no
idea

were
Really,
Mr.
Vyse,
Shall
we
join
the
others?
Congratulations.
Blessings.
Your
vicar's
benediction.
I
want
you
to
be
supremely
happy.
And
supremely
good,
And
now
I
want
my
tea.
Just
in
time.

Not

No!
No!
Come

Lucy!
What's
that
book?
Who's
been
taking
books
It's
only
a
library
book
Well,
pick
it
up.
It's
a
special
collection.
But

Yes,

Just

down.
Gracious

you

MRS.
HONEYCHURCH:
Go
on,
Powell.
Good-bye.
Be
good.
CECIL:
"No
place
on

where
love
is
spoken

So
he
cried,
'Utter

"They
brought
to

stand
face

to
bravely
fight,
to
stoutly
dare"...
CECIL:
Listen,
Lucy.
Three
split
infinitives.
-
"And
then
the
cry
was
heard...
'Once
more
into
the
breach,
GEORGE:
Victory,
Mr.
Floyd!
"The
scene
is
set
in
Florence.
The

The

of
Italy."

Of

I

the
title?
Under
a
Loggia
by
Eleanor
Lavish.
Eleanor
Lavish?
My
goodness!
Do
you
remember
Miss
Lavish,
-
Yes,
of
course
I
do.
Still,
one
ought
to
read
it,

There's
an
absurd
account
Oh,
no,
do
read
it.
What
do
you
think
of
our
view,
My
father
says
there's
and
that's
the
view
I
expect

father

Cecil,
do
read
-
Not
while
Mr.
Emerson
is
here
to
entertain
us.
Nothing's
funnier
than
And
if
Mr.
Emerson
finds
us
frivolous,
Go
and
look
for
tennis
balls,
-
Do
I
have
to?
CECIL:
It's
in
chapter
two.
CECIL:
Give
it
here.
-
No,
really,
honestly.
It's
the
silliest
thing.
-
C-Cecil!
Aha.
"Afar
off,
the
towers
of
Florence.
And
she
wandered
as
though
in
a
dream...
through
the
wavering,
touched
with
crimson
stains
of
poppies.
All
unobserved,
he
came
to
her."
Isn't
it
immortal?
"There
came
from
his
lips
no
wordy
No
eloquence
was
his,
He
simply
enfolded
her
No,
this
isn't
the
bit.
-
Should
we
go
in
to
tea?

Excuse
me.
LUCY:
Charlotte,
a
minute.
Cecil,
ask
Mary
for
sandwiches.
I'll
be
with
you
in
a
moment.
Do
you
know
anything
There's
a
scene
in
it...
Do
you
know
about
that?
Do
you
know
about
it?
They're
on
a
hillside,
There
are
poppies
and
a
barley
field.

Charlotte,
how
could
you
have
told
her?
Oh,
Lucy.
Oh,
dearest
girl.
She
hasn't
put
that
in
her
novel.
Then
never...
never,
never
more
shall
Eleanor
Lavish
So
you
did
tell.
Why,
when
you

Cecil
read
it
to
me.
And
that
man
took
the
opportunity...
to
insult
me
again
behind
Cecil's
back.
Why
did
you
tell
her?
What
made
you?
Even
if
you
forgive
me,
till
my
dying
day.
Go
and
call
him.
Call
Mr.
Vyse?
No.
The
other
one.
This
time
I'll
deal
with
him
myself.
You
missed
a
good
match,
Miss
Bartlett.

LUCY:
Charlotte,
please
stay.
Mr.
Emerson,
go
out
of
this
house...
and
don't
come
back
into
it
again
-
I
can't.
Go,
please.
You
don't
mean
You're
being
ridiculous.
Oh,
I
would
have
held
back
But
he's
the
sort
who
can't
know
anyone
He
doesn't
know
what
a
woman
is.
He
wants
you
for
a
possession,
like
a
painting
or
an
ivory
box.
Something
to
own
and
to
display.
He
doesn't
want
you
to
be
real...
to
think
and
to
live.
He
doesn't
love
you.
But
I
love
you.
I
want
you
to
have
your
own
thoughts
even
when
I
hold
you
in
my
arms.
Miss
Bartlett,
you
wouldn't
stop
us
It's
our
last
chance.

Do
you
understand
how
lucky
people
are
It's
such
a
blessing.
Don't
you
see?
And
the
fact
that
I
love
Cecil
I
suppose
that's
This
tremendous
thing
and
what
it
means...
let
me
explain...
it
means
that
nothing
That's
what
it
means.
I've
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about.
Everyone
has
to
understand.
And
you
must
leave.
It
was
wrong
of
me...
very
wrong...
But
you
haven't
been
listening.
Leave
at
once.
Now.
-
Lucy...
I
will
not
listen
to
one
more
word.

CHARLOTTE:
My
dears,
do
stop.
LUCY:
Don't
interfere
again.
It's
useless.
Let
me
go,
Miss
Bartlett.
Let
Mr.
Emerson
go,
Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE:
I
shall
never
forgive
myself.
You
always
say
that,
Charlotte,

What
is
it
about
Italy...
that
makes
lady
novelists
Lucy,
it's
still
light
enough

Mr.
Emerson
has
had
to

I
say,
Cecil.
Do
play.
There's
a
good
chap.
It's
Floyd's
last
day.
Freddy,
as
you
well
there
are
some
chaps
who
are
no
good
I
plead
guilty
to
being
such
a
chap.
Because
I
wouldn't
I
never
do
play
tennis.
I
never
could.
Forget
the
tennis.
I'm
sorry,
Cecil.
I
can't
marry
you.
One
day
you'll
thank
me
for
saying
so.
-
We're
too
different.
I
love
you.
And...
I
did
think
you
loved
me.
I
did
not.
I
thought
I
did
at
first.
I'm
sorry.
As
for
your
loving
me,
You
don't.
It's
only
as
something
else.
As
something
you
own.
A
painting.
A
Leonardo.
I
don't
want
to
be
a
Leonardo.
Oh,

not
go
on
now.
I'll
only
say

don't

evidently.

exactly

True,

so

a
different

do
you

by
"a
new

you
think
I'm
in
love
with
someone

No,
of

I
don't.

was

It's
disgusting,
brutal!
You
must
forgive
me
My
brain
has
gone
to
pieces.
I
think
I'd
better
go
to
bed,
Let
me
do
that
for
you.
I
must
actually
thank
you
for
showing
me
what
I
really
am.
I
admire
your
courage.
Will
you
shake
hands?
Of
course
I
will,
Cecil.
Good
night.
I'm
sorry
about
it.
Thank
you
for
taking
it
so
well.

It's

George
is
so
sorry.
Oh,
I
cannot
blame

but
I
wish
he'd
told
me
about
it
first.
He
never
told
you
Not
one
word.
No.
Lucy
said
he
wouldn't.
I
was
only
told
last
Sunday.
What
were
you
told?
That
he
loves
her.
Won't
you...
Won't
you
sit
down?
I-I...
I
think
I
hear
the
carriage.
It
would
be
most
discourteous
There
isn't
any

Sit
down,

Everyone's

here's

don't

Take
this.
There.
Oh,
you
look
much
better.
Oh,
so,
she,
uh...
she's
not
marrying
Mr.

Why?
Why
Greece?
Why
go
rushing
off
You're
tired
of

You're
tired
of

And
you're
tired

Of
course
I'm
not
tired
of
Windy
Corner.
But
as
we're
talking
about
it...
I
may
as
well
say
that
in
the
future
I
might
even
share
a
flat
You
see,

right,

on.

an
agreeable

a

No

Lucy,
go
and
see
And
do
hurry,
both
of
you...
because
Mary
has
her
fish
pie
in.
Did
you
hear
what
I
said,
Lucy?
Lucy!
Mr.
Emerson
says
it's
all
his
fault.
Because
I
told
him
to
trust
to
love.
I
told
him,
"George,
love
It's
what
I
taught
him.
So
you
see,
it
is
all
my
fault.
Where
are
you
going?

dear
mother

kindly
offered

I
have
not
been

all

get
in,
Charlotte.

fish
pie
spoils,

I
will
sit
here.
No,
this
will
do
me
very
well.

Charlotte!

to
discuss

misbehaved

"Abominable"
is
too
strong
a
word.
I'm
sorry.
It's
no
good
George
is
coming
He
can't
bear
to
be
here,
He
says
the
thought
of...
seeing
you
or
hearing
about
you...
Oh,
Mr.
Emerson,
please
don't
go.
I'm
going
to
Greece.
Don't
leave
your
comfortable
house.
Why
are
you
going
to
Greece?
Forgive
me,
my
dear,
but
it
seems
to
me
Seems
to
me
that
the
reason
the
reason
you've
Yes,
Miss
Bartlett
told
me...
is
that...
you
love
George.

All
the
light's
Just
like
it's
gone
out
of
George.
I
can't
bear
it,
Dear
girl,
forgive
me.
But
I've
got
to
go
to
Greece
now.
The
ticket's
bought
and
everything.
Oh,
it's
impossible.
There's
only
one
thing
impossible.
That's
to
love...
and
to
part.
MRS.
HONEYCHURCH:
Lucy!
You
love
George.
You
love
the
boy
body
and
soul,
But
of
course
I
do.
What
did
you
all
think?
-
Then...
Mother's
calling.
I've
got
to
go.
They
trust
me.
Why
should
they...
when
you've
deceived
everyone...
including
yourself?
Charlotte,
come
and
sit
here.
-
Go
on,
Powell.
One
week
Italy.
The
next
week
Greece.
CHARLOTTE:
-
What?
I
think
Lucy
has
something
to
tell
us.
-
Stop
the
horse!
LUCY'S
VOICE:
"Dear
Cousin
Charlotte...
After
an
appalling
journey
during
which
our
we
reached
Florence.
You'll
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
Pensione
The
Cockney
signora
still
marches
Even
her
guests
appear
of
Miss
Alans,
Miss
Lavish,
Mr.
Beebe...
and,
indeed,
Charlotte
and
Lucy."
We
were
promised
rooms
with
a
view.
Hush,
dear.
We
mustn't.
First
thing
tomorrow,
I
shall
have
But
not
now.
It's
so
unfair.
Don't
you
agree
one
must
have
a
room
with
a
view?
We
have
a
view.
Kiss
me
again.
-
And
again.
-

It's
from
Freddy.
What
does
he
say?
Silly
boy.
He
thinks
he's
being
dignified.
I
mean,
everybody
knew...
we
were
going
away
in
the
spring.
