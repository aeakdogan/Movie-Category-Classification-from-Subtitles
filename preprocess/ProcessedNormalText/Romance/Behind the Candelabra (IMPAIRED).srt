those
rings
And
I
always
tell
them,

Thank
you.
And
now
I'd
like
another
pair
to
join
me
in
a
duet.
My
protégé
and
friend,
Mr.
Billy
Leatherwood!

Bob:
A
matched
pair
of
queens.
Oh.
It's
funny
that

There's
Ray.
Come

One
night,
to
play
this
popular
hit
parade

had
a
melody,
it
wasn't
a
challenge
but
I
played
it,
you
know,
And
then,
I
don't
know
but
I
got
this
inspiration
as
if
it
was
composed
And
they
loved
it!
-
You
would
have
thought
that
I
invented
the
piano.
And
I
knew
it
was
all
about
And
that's
what
I
love
to
give
people

feel
And
I've
had

I've
had
quite
a
drive,
and...
you
know,
And
it's
a
terrible
thing
and
the

like
wanting
to
sing
And
no

Of

problem
was,
not

I
was

can't

Devout.
The
turning
point
was
Kennedy
I
was
working
non-stop
I
felt
terrible.
We
found
out
later...
that
when
those
heavy

they
use
this
I
would
sweat...
into
my

Can
you
imagine?
But
no

knew.
So
I'm
watching

I
think...
at

I

nobody's
going
to
come

no.

I
asked
to

her

they
said,
there's

here
"There
are
