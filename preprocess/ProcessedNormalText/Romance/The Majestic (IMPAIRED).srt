The

from
Roosevelt.
Your
names

there.
So

the
others.
I
knew
all
these
guys?
We
both
did.
We
went
to
school
with
most
of
them.
Im
sorry.
We
used
to
sneak
in
here
This
was
our
secret
place.
You,
me,
Stevie
Wardlow...
...Tully
Wentworth.
-Thats
why
you
brought
me
here?
Dad
said
if
I
took
you
places
...and
showed
you
things
only
we
knew
So

here
for...
...purely
medical
reasons?
Not
entirely.
Im
trying
to
make
up
my
own
mind
Join
the
club.
So,
what
do
you
think?
The
jurys
still
out.
Fair
enough.
Any
other
secret
places
-Really,
it
fueled
my
dream.
Im
serious.
Youll
have
to
start
making
sense
You
wanted
to
be
a
lawyer
because
We
used
to
go
Once,
when
I
was
11,
the
movie
playing
About
the
Dreyfus
affair.
You
remember
movies,
Yeah.
-Weird,
huh?
In
the
movie,
Zola
stood
up
in
court
...of
forfeiting
its
honor
Zola
wasnt
a
lawyer,
of
course,
I
decided
right
then
-Just
from
that?
"In
the
presence
of
this
tribunal,
...before
you,
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
...I
swear
that
Dreyfus
is
innocent!
By
all
Ive
won,
all
Ive
written
...I
swear,
Dreyfus
is
innocent."
"May
all
that
melt
away,
may
my
name
"He
is
innocent."
Its
pretty
good
stuff,
huh?
Not
bad
at
all.
The
suns
going.
Come
on.
Watch
your
eyes.
-Is
this
another
secret
place?
We
used
to
come
up
here
all
the
time
And
thats
what
made
it
special?
This
is
also
where
we
had
We
were
14.
That
is
special.
Wish
I
could
remember
that.
Me
too.
We
were
in
love,
werent
we?
Yeah.
-What
was
that?
-Im
fine.
Really.
Just
ignore
it.
Its
going
away.
So
were
we
gonna
be
married?
When
you
got
back
from
overseas.
We
were
engaged
Anything
I
can
do
Yeah.
But
its
something
-Tell
me.
Your
father
said
any
little
thing
It
still
works.
-Found
me.
Just
me
and
the
dog.
-Whats
his
name?
-Simple.
I
like
it.
-Is
that
you?
In
the
first
World
War?
-Its
okay
with
you
that
I
live
here?
Just
checking.
Right,
the
watch.
Whats
that
for?
So
I
make
sure
the
shows
always
start
-Ill
see
what
I
can
do.
I
had
me
a
nice
watch
once.
The
pocket
watch
kind,
with
a
chain.
Kept
good
time
until
it
broke.
Never
had
the
money
to
get
it
fixed.
By
then,
the
theater
closed
down,
I
put
it
away
somewhere
But
that
was
years
ago...
...and
I
cant
remember
where.
Lost
me
a
medal
for
bravery
once
too,
Lost
it
in
the
hospital,
I
think.
I
forget
things
sometimes...
...since
the
war.
Yeah...
...me
too.
Trash.
Vile,
despicable
trash.
Its
about
the
West
Virginia
The
plight
of
the
downtrodden
worker
-Communist
propaganda,
start
to
end.
Theres
a
dog
in
it
I
like,
-Tell
me
about
Appleton.
Hes
been
gone
four
or
five
days.
Four
or
five
days?
Gentlemen,
we
may
What
kind
of
man
hides
Not
an
innocent
one.
What
if
Appleton
Not
just
another
schmuck,
but
an
One
with
lots
of
secrets
to
spill.
The
Reds
would
do
anything
We
have
one
of
two
scenarios
here.
Number
one:
His
Communist
friends
Number
two:
Theyre
trying
to
get
him
I
dont
intend
...and
see
him
get
a
heros
welcome
-What
shall
we
tell
Mr.
Hoover?
You
find
him.
Living
or
dead.
Whatever
it
takes.
His
trail
will
lead
us
...that
will
make
the
Rosenbergs
look
Adele!
Got
it!
Hi.
-Do
I
have
a
stain?
What?
Seeing
you
there
gave
me
-You
wore
that
when
we
last
went
out.
-Dont
be
silly.
It
still
fits.
Shall
we?
-Good
evening.
-Hi.
Smells
good.
I
caught
it
from
here.
Lukes
here!
Here
he
comes!
Here
he
comes!
Ill
be
right
back.
Hey,
buddy.
Well
take
it
from
here.
Ill
get
you
for
that.
I
think
Luke
and
Adele
should
lead
Care
to
dance?
I
think
wed
better.
Youre
pretty
good.
Thanks.
You
too.
When
did
you
learn
to
dance?
That
was
nerve-racking.
Id
kill
that
Spencer
kid,
-Looks
like
your
investment
paid
off.
In
high
school,
You
wanted
to
be
Benny
Goodman
-And?
...in
the
worst
way.
You
gave
the
clarinet
to
Spencer.
He
used
to
drive
you
crazy,
following
I
gave
him
the
clarinet.
He
started
-Did
you
remember
that,
or...?
Arent
they
a
sight?
So
they
are,
Harry.
Something
wrong?
Something
is
troubling
me.
What
could
trouble
you
Just
look.
Your
daughter,
Everything
the
way
it
should
be.
Still,
I
cant
help
wondering,
-I
mean,
9
1/2
years!
He
went
missing
during
the
war,
right?
So
he
must
have
been
injured
overseas,
So,
what
happened
when
he
came
back,
Did
he
start
a
new
life
for
himself?
What
if
Luke
spent
the
last
decade
I
dont
care.
But
dont
you
see?
People
who
care
about
him.
You
could
be
a
grandfather
Im
not
trying
to
step
on
your
joy.
But
what
happens
Which
life
will
he
remember?
Which
would
he
choose?
-So
are
you
proud
of
your
boy,
Avery?
Oh,
yeah!
I
think
Spencers
got
a
big
future
You
know,
folks,
here
in
Lawson...
...we
gave
a
lot
to
our
country.
And
we
never
complained.
And
we
never
faltered.
And
we
never
forgot.
We
never
forgot.
And
so,
when
one
of
our
own...
...came
back
to
us,
Luke...
...seeing
you
walk
down
the
street,
It
was
kind
of
like
seeing
one
I
think
I
speak
for
all
of
us
here
...that
not
a
day
goes
by...
...that
we
dont
keep
But,
Luke,
having
you
back
among
us...
...that
helps
us
keep
God
bless
you,
son.
God
bless
you.
Now,
on
a
lighter
note...
...weve
had
a
special
request
...Irene
Terwilliger.
There
you
are.
Ive
tutored
music
in
this
town...
...for
more
years
than
I
care
to
say.
In
fact,
many
of
you
here
tonight
have
And
as
talented
as
you
all
were...
...the
most
talented
pupil
...was
Luke
Trimble.
Luke,
you
played
the
piano
It
would
do
my
heart
a
world
of
good
Wont
you
come
up?
-Yes,
come
up!
Come.
-You
never
told
me
about
the
piano.
Thats
right.
Im
not
sure
I
remember
ever
playing.
Music
is
in
the
soul,
Luke.
...and
let
it
all
come
back
to
you.
Franz
Liszt.
Hungarian
Rhapsody
No.
2.
Like
this.
Follow
me.
Now
you.
Really,
Luke!
Thats
no
way
Stop
it,
I
say!
Who
taught
you
to
play
like
that?
Where
did
you
learn
I
taught
him
that!
-I
think
Spencer
was
loopy.
He
was
blowing
some
bad
notes
Good
night.
Good
night.
Bob?
Bob
Leffert.
Thats
who
I
am.
-Im
not
sure
what
you
mean.
I
didnt
like
him
much.
Not
saying
hes
bad,
You
know
the
feeling?
Someone
rubs
you
You

of
rub
me
that
way.
What
I
want
to
know
is,
what
game
Just
a
guy
This
towns
had
enough
heartbreak.
Too
much.
Me,
I
think

I
hope
Im

anybody
Why

Im
sorry.
Oh,

God.
I

start.
I
wanted
you
to

I
wanted

Big
turnout?
These
arent
your
people.
-Not
when
the
Committee
gets
through.
-Theyve
been
on
with
their
lawyers.
They
hate
to
admit
it,
but
youre
-Gee,
theres
a
relief.
Theyre
anxious
to
save

...which
means

drawn
up.

-I
dont
know
any
of
these
people.
All
you
do
is
show
up,
-I
wont
be
a
Communist
anymore?
-Does
it
matter
that
I
never
was
one?
But
its
their
game.
You
play
by
their
rules,
I
thought
this
was
a
democracy.

Declaration
of
Independence?
Just
pieces
of

-Im

Were
you
on
Main
Street
today,
I
hate
to
be
the
one
...but
Im
not
Luke.
-Yeah,
I
knew
that.
Since
the
welcome-home
dance,
-Youre
kidding!
Luke
played
the
classics
...but
when
it
come
to
getting
jazz,
When
I
heard
that
fine
roadhouse
You
didnt
say
anything?
Nobody
else
had
to
know.
This
town
needed
you
to
be
Luke,
But
Im
not
Luke
anymore.
-Thats
why
Im
going
back
to
L.A.
-For
good.
You
are.
-Me?
I
dont
know
about
that.
Harry
would
have
wanted
you
to
keep
I
didnt
know
you
were
here.
I
was
just...
...saying
goodbye.
Adele,
Im
sorry
the
way
I
never
meant
to
hurt
anyone,
People
get
hurt
sometimes,
Its
just
the
way
things
are.
So
are
you
really
a
Communist?
No,
Im
really
not.
I
didnt
think
so.
Only
a
capitalist
Great
endorsement.
-Well,
if
it
helps.
-So,
what
will
you
tell
the
Committee?
"Sorry,
I
wont
Youre
not
serious.
-Whats
wrong
with
it?
Be
more
specific.
Aside
from
the
fact
that
this
is

you
want
to
be,

a
duty
as
well
as
a
right

you
feel
strongly
Damn
right!
It
doesnt
make
it
any
less
rigged.
And
theres
burden
of
proof,
In
law
school,
but
the
rest
of
us
I
mess
with
these
guys,
I
go
to
jail.
All
the
more
reason
to
fight
them.
Like
Luke
would
have
done?
-Yes,
like
Luke
would
have
done.
Tell
me
again
what
a
great
guy
Luke
-He
would
have
stood
up.
...to
vouch
for
that.
Everybodys
memory
of
Luke
Besides,
Im
not
Luke.
While
he
was
liberating
Europe,
He
couldnt
wait
to
save
the
world!
-Why?
I
wanted
to
survive!
...you
get
mowed
down.
Thats
the
real
world.
I
want
my
goddamn
life
back.
Wow.
I
really
did
have
you
two
confused.
Last
call
for
California
West
Where
the
hell

this
to
me,
kid.

Come
on.
How
is
she?
She
came
back
from
the
cemetery
She
wanted
you
to
have
this.

is
it?
All

cause
When
bullies
rise
up,
we
have
to
Thats
a
simple
idea,
I
suppose,
The
only
thought
that
saddens
me,
...is
the
thought
of
never
seeing
you.
Not
holding
you,
not
seeing
our
...not
spending
the
passing
years
If
I
should
not
come
back,
know
that
Should
you
be
walking
years
from
now
...and
feel
a
warm
breeze
...that
warm
breeze
will
be
me,
Remember,
finally,
above
all...
...that
I
love
you.
Luke.
Mr.
Appleton?
Are
you
a
Communist?
Anything
you
want
to
say?
The
Committee
will
come
to
order.
Well
have
order
in
the
chamber!
Let
me
begin
by
saying
I
admonish
those
here
to
view
...or
this
chamber
will
be
cleared.
The
witness
will
please
stand
Do
you
swear
the
testimony
...will
be
the
truth,
the
whole
truth
-I
do.
State
your
full
name
and
residence.
Peter
Appleton,
Hollywood,
California.
Im
informed
you
have
a
prepared
-Yes,
sir.
...before
he
reads
his
statement,
Just
to
clear
the
air.
Americans
deserve
to
know
the
extent
...that
threatens
our
way
of
life.
We
were
told
the
witness
would
So
he
will,
but
hell
answer
Mr.
Appleton,
you
mentioned
But
for
the
last
several
months
you
Yes,
thats
true.
Have
you
ever
met
No,
sir.
Thats
not
possible.
That
didnt
prevent
you
from
Order!
I
wasnt
masquerading.
I
was
mistaken
for
Luke.
Im
sure
anyone
who
reads
the
paper
An
accident
which
came
hard
upon
What
I
find
hard
to
understand
is
why
One
might
view
that
I
wasnt
fleeing,
sir.
I
simply
went
for
a
drive
and
had
Order!
What
is
the
state
of
your
memory
now?
-My
memory
is
fine.
You
might
recall
the
item
before
you.
Its
the
attendance
roster
for
...dated
October
3rd,
1945.
Referring
to
line
37,
does
your
name
-It
does.
...tell
us
about
If
the
Committee
will
note
line
36
-"Lucille
Angstrom"?
I
attended
the
meeting
Are
you
asking
us
to
believe
...of
a
Communist
organization
Yes,
sir.
Even
someone
like
yourself
-Please
confine
your
answers.
Im
having
trouble
reconciling
Youre
prepared
to
purge
yourself
Yet
when
questioned,
you
claim
-I
didnt.
Im
hesitant
to
say.
You
agreed
to
be
forthcoming.
Well,
I
went
as...
...a
horny
young
man.
Order
in
the
chamber!
Order!
He
doesnt
want
to
spar
-Theyll
eat
him
alive.
Good.
Believe
me,
you
do
not
want
What
is
the
purpose
of
this?
Mr.
Appleton
came
here
Yet
hes
treated
as
a
hostile
witness.
Point
taken.
Lets
cut
to
the
chase
If
hes
not
pleading
the
5th,
Elvin.
Lets
not
open
this
any
further.
I
want
this
little
turd
to
read
The
Committee
sees
no
cause
Mr.
Appleton
may
proceed
"I,
Peter
Appleton...
...by
way
of
purging
myself...
...of
my
indiscretions...."
Mr.
Appleton?
Im
sorry,
Mr.
Chairman.
I
think
I
need
some
water.
Go
ahead,
son.
I
cant
do
this.
Ill
make
this
simple.
You
read
that
statement,
-Jail?
Just
read
the
damn
statement.
"I,
Peter
Appleton...."
Mr.
Appleton,
the
Committees
patience
I
understand
that,
Mr.
Chairman.
Im
sorry.
Im
sorry.
It
occurs
to
me
theres
a
bigger
issue
Bigger
issue?
Actually,
not
to
be
contrary,
Gosh,
I
dont
quite
know
what
to
say.
Fact
is,
I....
Ive
never
been
a
man
I
never
saw
the
percentage
in
it.
And
quite
frankly...
...I
suppose...
...I
lacked
the
courage.
See,
Im
not
like
Luke
Trimble.
He
had
the
market
cornered
I
never
met
the
guy,
but
I
feel
The
thing
is,
I
cant
help
wondering
...if
he
were
standing
here
right
now.
I
think
hed
probably
tell
you...
...the
America
represented
...is
not
the
America
I
think
hed
say
your
America
...and
cruel
and
small.
Come
to
order!
I
know
his
America
was
big.
With
a
wide-open
heart!
Even
if
you
dont
like
Enough!
You
are
out
of
order!
If
he
were
here,
...if
you
could
explain
to
him
You
are
skating
Thats
the
first
thing
My
client
is
clearly
under
...of
the
questioning
of
Mr.
Clyde.
-We
wish
to
invoke
the
5th
Amendment.
-We
do.
Shut
up
and
let
me
get
through
this.
But
there
is
another
Amendment
I
wonder
if
anyone
here
"Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
Youre
out
of
order!
"Shall
make
no
law...
-...respecting--"
"An
establishment
of
religion...
...or
prohibiting
...or
abridging
freedom
of
speech,
....or
of
the
right
to
petition
Do
not
presume
to
lecture
The
First
Amendment.
Its
what
Let
him
talk.
Hes
hanging
himself.
Its
part
of
the
contract
Even
though
the
Constitution
...are
just
pieces
of
paper
...theyre
the
only
contracts
we
have
...to
renegotiation.
-Not
by
you,
Mr.
Chairman.
-Not
by
you,
Mr.
Clyde.
Not
by
anyone,
ever.
Too
many
people
have
paid
in
blood.
Enough,
sir!
You
are
out
of
order!
People
like
Luke
Trimble...
...and
all
the
sons
Damn
right.
And
they
deserve
better
than
this.
All
you
boys
do.
I
will
have
order
When
you
get
...thats
all
I
have
to
say
to
you.
You
are
not
excused!
The
witness
will
resume
his
seat!
You
will
resume
your
seat!
Im
going
to
the
studio.
Home.
-Gotta
pack.
Im
going
to
prison.
Why
do
you
think
youre
You
saw
it.
I
just
told
them
Thats
one
way
to
see
it.
-What
other
way
is
there?
They
made
a
hero
out
of
you.
No,
I
dont
think
so.
If
youre
gonna
be
a
hero,
While
you
talked
to
reporters,
-What
kind
of
a
deal?
They
thrive
on
names.
With
a
witness
I
didnt
give
them
any
names.
Suddenly
Lucille
Angstrom
I
didnt
give
them
her
name.
It
was
-Thats
not
how
they
see
it.
Shes
just
a
girl
I
knew
in
college,
-Is
she?
...and
she
happens
to
be
a
producer
-Oh,
my
God!
At
this
very
moment,
Chairman
Doyle
...thanking
you
for
purging
yourself.
-For
what?
Ruining
this
womans
life?
The
Committee
already
knew
about
her.
Hell...
...who
do
you
think
named
you?
-She
named
me?
The
point
is,
the
studio
Your
movie
is
back
in
production.
Congratulations,
Pete.
You
got
your
life
back.
What
about
the
end
of
the
movie?
It
doesnt
feel
like
he
Guy
makes
a
speech,
how
do
we
know
How
about
an
injury?
He
breaks
-We
could
break
his
leg.
What
if
hes
in
an
iron
lung?
He
should
go
to
the
rally
Hold
on.
I
think
I
got
a
"what
if."
What
if
the
main
character--
-Heywood.
What
if,
during
the
cave-in,
he
gets
That
way,
during
the
rally,
-...leads
him
there
to
give
the
speech.
-I
got
tears.
Its
great.
Not
a
dry
eye
in
the
house.
Lets
ask
the
writer.
Wow,
thats
just....
Just
about
the
dumbest
thing
Hey.
I
got
a
"what
if."
-May
I
help
you,
sir?
Yes,
sir,
go
ahead.
Dear
Adele,
stop.
Am
coming
back
to
Lawson
to
return
Would
very
much
like
If
youre
not
on
the
platform
when
I
will
leave
your
book
and
...get
back
on
the
train
...stop.
Let
me
get
that
for
you.
Welcome
back!
Welcome
home.
Im
so
happy
to
see
you.
I
knew
you
couldnt
stay
away.
Look
at
you!
Welcome
home.
You
too.
Welcome
back
again.
So,
what
was
your
question?
I
forget.
Have
a
good
night.
Enjoy
the
show.
Two
adults?
