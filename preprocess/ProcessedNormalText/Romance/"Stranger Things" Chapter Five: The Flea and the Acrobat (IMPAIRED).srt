Thanks.





-
No.

-

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
Forgot
all
the
cameras,
bub?
Look,
Dr.
Brenner
asked
How
else
do
you
think

What's
your
name
again?
It's
Jim
Hopper.
Chief
Jim
Hopper.
Yeah,
I've
got
Jim
Hopper...
-

Come
again?


Hey...
you
mind
if
I
borrow
this
one?
-


-

It'll
calm
your
nerves.
Help
you
think
straight,
yeah?
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
I
know.
I
know.

This
whole
time...
I...
I
could...
I
could
feel
him.
He
was...
He
was
so
close.
-
I
knew
he
was
alive.
Our
hands...
Now
it's
like
I...
uh...

God,
it's
like
-
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.
Like
how
everybody
is
looking
at
me.
-
Like
I'm
out
of
my
damn
mind.
You're
not
gonna
like
this,
but
I
think
you
need
to
seriously
consider
It's
in
your
head.

-
You
remember
your
Aunt
Darlene?
No,
this
is
not
that.
I
mean,
when
something
like
this
happens,
your
mind
makes
up
stuff
I
mean,
Jesus,
there's
a
funeral
and
you're
saying
his
body
is
fake.
He's
in
the
wall.
I
mean,
how
do
you
explain
that?
-

-
At
least
go
talk
to
a
shrink
or...
-
What
about
Pastor
Charles
or
someone...
Joyce,
you
just
told
me...
that
Will
is
gone.
-
What
else
is
there
to
do?
Hey.


Will?
Will?
Will?
Will?

What
was
Will
saying?
Like
home...
Like
home...
but
dark?

And
empty.

Empty
and
cold.
I
don't
know.

It's
like
riddles
in
the
dark.
Like
home.
Or
maybe
like
Hawkins.
Upside
down.
-
What'd
she
say?
-

What?
When
El
showed
us
where
Will
was,
Upside
down.
Dark.
Empty.
Do
you
understand
what
he's
talking
about?
-
No.
When
El
took
us
to
find
Will,
Yeah.
But
what
if
he
was
there?
What
if
we
just
couldn't
see
him?
What
if
he
was
on
the
other
side?
What
if
this
is
Hawkins
and...
this
is
where
Will
is?
The
Upside
Down.
Like
the
Vale
of
Shadows.

Will?
-
Will?
Will?

-


I
see
him!
Hey!
Stop!

"The
Vale
of
Shadows
is
a
dimension
that
is
a
dark
reflection
It
is
a
place
of
decay
and
death."

Will?
"A
plane
out
of
phase.
It
is
right
next
to
you,
-

Will?
An
alternate
dimension.
But...
how...
how
do
we
get
there?
You
cast
Shadow
Walk.
In
real
life,
dummy.
We
can't
shadow
walk,
but...
maybe
she
can.
Do
you
know
how
we
get
there?

Oh,
my
God!


What
the
hell?



Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Hey,
kid.
What's
going
on?
Your
dad's,
uh,
gonna
stay
here
tonight.

Yeah,
I'm
here
How
are
you
holding
up?
What
happened?
-
Don't
worry
about
that.
that
thing
you
saw
before,
Jonathan,
that's
enough.

Can
we
talk?
Alone?
-
You
need
to
leave.
We
all
are.
But
you
need
to
listen
to
me.
Yeah.
Well,
you
being
here,
you're
just
making
things
worse,
-
Worse?
She
took
down
that
wall
with
an
ax.
She
said
that
Will
was
inside
Yeah.
This
isn't
some
kind
of
joke.
Your
mom
was
half
frozen
to
death
Trembling,
scared
out
of
her
mind.
You
come
in
here
and
you
start
or
whatever
the
hell
you
want
to
call
it,
you're
gonna
push
her
right
over
the
edge.
You
hear
me?

Look,
I'm
on
your
side.
I'm
here
to
help.
I'm
gonna
make
things
better

Thank
God
you're
here.
Do
me
a
favor.
If
not
for
me,
for
your
mother.
Take
that
down.
-
Good.
Ah...
there.
Looks
good.
-

You
look
nice,
sweetie.
Anything
else?
You
can
borrow
my
black
heels
if
you
want.
The
ones
you
wore
to
Cathy's
birthday.
I'm
fine.
Thanks.

Ugh.
Come
on.

-
Come
on.

"Fear
not,
Be
not
dismayed,
for
I
am
your
God.
I
will
strengthen
you.
Yes,
I
will
help
you.
I
will
uphold
you
It's
times
like
these
How,
if
He
is
truly
benevolent...
could
God
take
from
us
It
would
be
easy
to
turn
away
from
God...
but
we
must
remember
that
nothing,
not
even
tragedy,
We
are
here
today
to
find
comfort
-
and
to
surround
Will
and
his
family...
Just
wait
till
we
tell
Will
that

-

I'm
so,
so
sorry.
Yeah,
if
there's
anything
we
can
do...
I
appreciate
it.
Take
care,
all
right?
Thanks
for
coming
out.
I
see
Will
the
Wise
is
back.
What's
that
shooting
out
of
his
cane?
Fireballs.
I
couldn't
find
the
red
crayon,
Oh,
well...
if
he's
so
wise,
Why
can't
he
just,
you
know,
Most
of
the
time,
yeah,
totally.
But...
sometimes
the
bad
guys
You
know?
Yeah.
So
he
needs
the
fireballs?
Well,
yeah,
to
burn
them
to
a
crisp.
All
right.
Well,
I
don't
know
but
I'm
gonna
get
you
some
new
crayons
because
it
looks
like







Will!
Will,
it's
us!

Can
you
hear
us?

Hello?
Mom?

Why
can't
he
hear
us?

Mom,
it's
coming!
She
was
there.

This
is
where
we
know
-
So,
that's...
And
that's
the
woods
that's
my
house.
-
It's
all
so
close.
I
mean,
it's
all
within
a
mile
Whatever
this
thing
is,
it's...
You
want
to
go
out
there.
We
might
not
find
anything.
I
found
something.
And
if
we
do
see
it...
then
what?

We
kill
it.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Are
you
serious?
What?
You
want
to
find
this
thing
This
is
a
terrible
idea.
Yeah,
well,
it's
the
best
we've
got.
What?
You
can
tell
someone,
You
know
that.
Your
mom
would.
-
She's
been
through
enough.
Yeah,
and
I'll
tell
her...
when
this
thing
is
dead.
I
don't
know
what
in
the
world
caused
it.
-
Let's
take
a
look,
huh?
Mr.
Clarke
says
Mr.
Clarke?
Yeah,
he
runs
the
AV
Club.

That
right?
Apparently,
some
of
the
less



Mr.
Clarke?
Oh,
hey,
there.
How
are
you
boys
holding
up?

We're...
in...
mourning.
Man,
these
aren't
real
Nilla
Wafers.

We
were
wondering
-
We
have
some
questions.
So,
you
know
how
in
Cosmos,
Like,
beyond
our
world?
Yeah,
sure.
Theoretically.
Right,
theoretically.
So,
theoretically,
You
guys
have
been
thinking
about
Hugh
Everett's
Many-Worlds
Interpretation,
Well,
basically,
Just
like
our
world,
but
just
infinite
variations
of
it.
Which
means
there's
a
world
out
there
where
none
of
this
tragic
stuff
Yeah,
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
-
Oh.
of
an
evil
dimension,
You
know
the
Vale
of
Shadows?
An
echo
of
the
Material
Plane,

Yeah,
exactly.
If
that
did
exist,
how
would
we
travel
there?
-
Theoretically.
Picture...
an
acrobat...
standing
on
a
tightrope.
Now,
the
tightrope
is
our
dimension.
And
our
dimension
has
rules.
You
can
move
forwards,
or
backwards.
But,
what
if...
right
next
to
our
acrobat,
Now,
the
flea
can
also
travel
-
Right?
Here's
where
things
The
flea
can
also
travel
this
way...
along
the
side
of
the
rope.
He
can
even
go...
underneath
the
rope.
-

Upside
down.
But
we're
not
the
flea,
In
this
metaphor,
yes,
So
we
can't
go
upside
down?
No.
Well,
is
there
any
way
for
the
acrobat
Well...
you'd
have
to
create
More
than
humans
are
currently
to
open
up
some
kind
of
tear
and
then...
you
create
a
doorway.
-
Like
a
gate?
-
But
again,
this
is
all...
But...
but
what
if
this
gate
Well,
if
it
did,
I...
I
think
we'd
know.
It
would
disrupt
gravity,
the
magnetic
field,
our
environment.
Heck,
it
might
even
swallow
us
up
whole.
Science
is
neat.
But
I'm
afraid
it's
not
very
forgiving.
Whoa.
Hey,
Chief!
-

Hello?
Whoa!
-

Jesus,
Chief.
You
all
right?
-
We
tried
calling,
but...
Hey,
so
Bev
Mooney
came
in
Said
that
Dale
and
Henry
and
they
didn't
come
back
home.
She
thought
they
were
on
another
binger,
I
think
this
whole
Will
Byers
thing
-
Where
was
this?
No,
no.
Where
did
Henry
Oh.
Uh,
out
near
Kerley.
Mirkwood.
What?
Okay.
You
go
back
to
the
station.
-
Are
you
sure?
-
Oh,
hey.
Uh,
they
found
Barbara's
car.
Barbara
Holland's
car.
Staties
found
it
late
last
night
Funny,
right?
Yeah.

-
Is
he
off
his
meds
again?
He's
been
spending
too
much
time
That's
what
I
think.

What
are
you
doing?
What
does
it
look
like
I'm
doing?
You
want
to
freeze
to
death
all
winter?

-
I
told
you
not
to
take
these
down.
How
long
are
you
gonna
keep
those
up?
You
know,
it's
a
shame
-
What?
I
went
to
the
quarry
I
just
wanted
to
look
around,
you
know?
Couldn't
believe
it.
No
warning
signs,
no
fence,
no
nothing.
Ought
to
be
held
accountable
It
would
take
a
lot
of
energy
But
that's
got
to
be
what
happened.
-
Otherwise,
how'd
Will
get
there,
right?
What
we
want
to
know
is,
Then
how
do
you
know

Dustin,
what
are
you
doing?
-
Dustin!
-
I...
I
need
to
see
your
compasses.
Your
compasses.
What's
exciting
about
this?
-
Well,
they're
all
facing
north,
right?
-
Well,
that's
not
true
north.
I
mean
exactly
what
I
just
said.
Are
you
both
seriously
this
dense?
The
sun
rises
in
the
east,
Which
means
that's
true
north.
So
what
you're
saying

Do
you
even
understand
-
Do
you
see
a
battery
pack
on
this?
No,
you
don't.
The
needle's
naturally
drawn
So
what's
wrong
with
them?
Well,
that's
what
I
couldn't
figure
out,
You
can
change
the
direction
If
there's
the
presence
the
needle
deflects
to
that
power.
And
then
I
remembered
The
gate
would
have
so
much
power...
It
could
disrupt
Exactly.
Meaning,
if
we
follow
They
should
lead
us
to
the
gate.

Whoa,
whoa,
hey,
whoa,
whoa.
-

What
are
you
doing
here?
-
Nothing.
What?
No.
Oh,
no,
I
was
just...
-
thinking
about
joining
softball.
Well,
uh...
listen,
I'm
really
sorry.
I
mean,
even
before
you
threatened
me
Okay.
I
panicked
and...

-
I
mean,
I
was
a
total
dick.

Did
you
get
in
trouble
with
your
parents?
Totally,
but...
you
know,
who
cares?
Any
news
about
Barbara?
-
Parents
heard
from
her?
Or...
Hey,
listen.
Why
don't
we,
uh,
why
don't
we
Just
kinda
pretend
everything's
normal
All
The
Right
Moves
is
still
playing.

You
were

for
the
money!
The
money!
You
aren't
here
'cause
of
Will.
Jesus,
Joyce,
it
was
his
funeral
today.
-
I
can't
believe
I
fell
for
this.
-
To
help?

Oh,
like
maybe
To
pay
for
Jonathan
to
go
to
school!
-
Oh,
don't
do
that.
-
Lie
to
me!
Yeah,
well,
where
does
he
wanna
go?
-
Huh?
Where
does
Jonathan
We
get
that
money,
NYU,
Lonnie!
He's
wanted
to
go
to
NYU
So
then
he
goes
to
NYU!
Get
out.
Get
out!
You
need
me
here,
Joyce.

Oh,
brother,
Oh,
no?

Oh,
don't
you
dare.
-
At
least
I
was
here!
Just
look
around
at
this
place.
All
your
Christmas

What

I

Maybe
I
am

Maybe
I'm
crazy.
But,
God
help
me,
I
will
keep
if
I
think
there's
a
chance
Now,
get
out!
Get
out
of
my
house!


You're
supposed
No,
actually,
you
see
the
spaces
I'm
aiming
for
those.
Ah.
You
ever
shot
a
gun
before?
-

Have
you
met
my
parents?
Yeah,
I
haven't
shot
one
since
I
was
ten.
My
dad
took
me
hunting
on
my
birthday.
He
made
me
kill
a
rabbit.
-
A
rabbit?
I
guess
he
thought
it
would
make
me
I
cried
for
a
week.
Jesus.
What?
I'm
a
fan
of
Thumper.

I
meant
your
dad.
Yeah.
I
guess
he
and
my
mother

...I
wasn't
around
for
that
part.
Um,
yeah.
Just,
uh,
point
and
shoot.
I
don't
think
my
parents
They
must've
married
for
some
reason.
My
mom
was
young.
My
dad
was
older,
but
he
had
a
cushy
job,
money,
So
they
bought
a
nice
house
and
started
their
nuclear
family.
Screw
that.
Yeah.
Screw
that.

-

Hello?
Jim?
-
Yeah.
Why
are
you
calling
me
here?
I
know,
I
know,
I
know.
I
just
wanted
to
hear
your
voice
I
just
wanted
to
say
that,
um...
even
after
everything
that
happened,
I
don't
regret
any
of
it.
And
those
seven
years,
they
were...
Have
you
been
drinking?
No.
-
No.

Honey,
hey...
Hey,
it's
okay...

You
know
what,
actually,
Jim,
I
can't...
Just
take
care
of
yourself,
okay?
Say
hi
to
Bill
for
me.
Are
you
sure...



How
much
further?
I
don't
know.
You
really
need
to
learn
more
I'm
just
saying.
How
do
we
know
Uh,
I
think
a
portal
to
another
dimension

Do
you
think
she's
acting
weird?
You're
asking
if
the
weirdo
I
mean,
weirder
than
normal?
I
don't
know.

How
far,
Papa?
Farther
than
we've
ever
gone
before.
-
The
bath?
Yes,
the
bath.
Is
that
okay?
Okay.
Mike.
Yeah?
Turn
back.
What?
Why?
I'm
tired.

Look,
I'm
sure
we're
almost
there.


You
never
said
what
I
was
saying.

What?

Yesterday.
You
said
I
was
saying
something
Oh,
uh...
I
don't
know.
My
guess...
I
saw
this
girl,
you
know,
But
for
that
moment...
it
was
like
you
were
alone,
And,
you
know,
That
is
such
bullshit.

What?
I
am
not
trying
to
be
someone
else.
Just
because
I'm
dating
Steve
You
know
what?
Forget
it.
He's
actually
a
good
guy.

Okay.
Yesterday,
with
the
camera...
He's
not
like
that
at
all.
He
was
just
being
protective.
Yeah,
that's
one
word
for
it.
Oh,
and
I
guess
what
you
did
was
okay?
No,
I...
I
never
said
that.
He
had
every
right
to
be
pissed...
Okay,
all
right.
No.
Listen,
don't
take
it
so
personally,
okay?
I
don't
like
most
people.
You
know,
I
was
actually
starting
-
Yeah?
Yeah,
I
was
thinking,
maybe
he's
not
the
pretentious
creep
Well,
I
was
just
starting
-
Oh.
she's
not
just
another
suburban
girl
by
doing
exactly
what
until
that
phase
passes
who
now
works
sales,
and
they
live
out
a
perfectly
boring
Exactly
like
their
parents,
but
now,
hey,
they
get
it."



Go
away,
Lonnie.

Seriously!
I
am
gonna
murd...

What?
What?

Oh,
Jesus.

Oh,
no.
"Oh,
no"?
-
We're
headed
back
home.
-
Are
you
sure?
Setting
sun,
right
there.
And
you're
just
realizing
this
now?
-
Why
is
this
all
on
me?
What
do
yours
say?

North.

Maybe
the
gate
moved.
No,
I
don't
think
it's
the
gate.
I
think
it's
something
else
Maybe
it's
something
here.
No,
it
has
to
be
like
a
super
magnet.
It's
not
a
magnet.
She's
been
acting
weirder
than
normal.
If
she
can
slam
doors
with
her
mind,
Why
would
she
do
that?
Because
she's
trying
Because
she's
a
traitor!

Lucas,
what
are
you
doing?
You
did
it,
didn't
you?
You
don't
want
us
to
reach
the
gate.
You
don't
want
us
to
find
Will.

Lucas,
come
on,
seriously,
-
just
leave
her
alone!
-
No.
-
Fresh
blood.
I
knew
it.
I
saw
her
wiping
her
nose
on
the
tracks!
Bull!
That's
old
blood.
Right,
El?

It's...
not...
it's
not
safe.
-


Okay.
Should
be
okay,
I
mean...
I
can't
guarantee
it,
What
the
hell
is
going
on,
Hopper?
They
bugged
my
place.
-
What?
They
put
a
microphone
in
the
light.

It's
because
I'm
on
to
them
-
I
don't
know...
I
thought
they
might
be
watching
you,
too.
I
don't
know,
the
CIA,
the
NSA,
You
gotta
explain
this
to
me,
I
went
to
the
morgue
last
night,
Joyce.
What?
It
wasn't
him.
What?
Will's
body,
it
was
a
fake.

You
were
right.
This
whole
time,
you
were
right.
What
did
I
tell
you?
That's
not
true.
Find
Will?
Find
Will?
Where
is
he,
then?
Huh?
-
Yeah,
you
know
what
I
mean.
Just
think
about
it,
Mike.
She
could've
just
told
us
where
but
she
didn't.
She
just
made
us
-
All
right,
calm
down!
She
used
us,
all
of
us!
She
helped
just
enough
Food
and
a
bed.
-
She's
like
a
stray
dog.
No!
Screw
you,
Mike.
blind
because
you
like
But
wake
up,
man!
She
knows
where
Will
is,
and
now
she's
just
letting
him
die
-
Shut
up!
Shut
up.
We're
looking
for
some
stupid
monster...
but
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
I
said
shut
up!

-
Stop!
-
Stop
it!
-
Stop
it!

Jesus!
Lucas!
Lucas!
-
Lucas.
-
Lucas,
wake
up!
Lucas.
Why
would
you
do
that?
-

Come
on.

What
is
wrong
with
you?







-

I
have
no
idea.



Help!
Help!


Come
on,
wake
up.
Lucas...
-


Lucas.
Lucas,
you
okay?

Lucas...
Lucas,
Lucas,
how
many
fingers?
-

Let
me
see
your
head.

Just...
Lucas.
Get
off
of
me!
-
Lucas,
come
on.
Man,
let
him
go.
Where
is
El?


El?
-
El!
El!
-
Eleven!
Eleven!

What,
are
you
tired?
Shut
up.
What?
I
heard
something.


-

Oh,
God.


It's
been
hit
by
a
car.
We
can't
just
leave
it.

I'll
do
it.
-
I
thought
you
said...

-


What
was
that?


Where'd
it
go?
I
don't
know.
Do
you
see
any
more
blood?
No.

Jonathan?

Nancy!
Nancy?
Nancy?
Nancy,
where
are
you?
Nancy!
Nancy!
