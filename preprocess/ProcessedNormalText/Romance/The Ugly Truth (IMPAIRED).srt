Oh,

Because
I

Oh.
There

He
wasn't

Don't.
Okay,
he'll
be
And
when
you
don't,
How

If
you
want

You've
probably
already
done
with
your

might
even
be
too
late.
And
if
you
do

you'll
never
be
more

Abby,
his
desperate
neighbor.
I'm
not
desperate.
Why?
Did
you
think
Listen
to
you.
Desperately
asking
me

Ah!
Oh!
Although
you
won't
admit
it,
you
know
that
I

It's

call,
dude.
Fine.
What
do
I
do?
Pick
up

Why
would

If
you
do
exactly
as
I
say,
then
you'll
quit
giving
me

You

as
well
as
I
do
that
And
if

doesn't
work?
Then
I'll

I
figured
I

How

So
thanks
for

tonight.
To

That

of
coming.
He
likes
you,
by
the

I
can
tell.
Really?
COLIN:
Yeah.
I

All

I
thought
for

on
how
men
are
full
of
hot
air.
Right?
It's
good,
right?
No.
Well,
we
should
still
because
you're
great
when
I'm
sorry,
did
you
just
Yeah,
you
kind
of
are.
Hm.
Back
at
you,
babe.

So
tell

I

you
saw
me
introduce

wanna
be
actresses,

I
mean,
who
am
I

Mm,
such
a
generous
man.
Now,
you're
telling
me
Well,
no,
I
didn't
say
that.
Men,
or
man-whores,
prefer
women
in
slutty
clothes
Every

wants
that.
And
for
your
information,

only

here's
to

I'm
really
a

you're
a
foul-mouthed
slut.
Thank
you.
MIKE:
Never
assume
a

is
easy

are

it's
your
job,

and
figure
out
exactly

And
he's
back.
And
I'm
pretty
sure
you're
gonna
that

of
petunias.
Well,
thanks,
Mike.
Coming
up
after
this

gonna
see

hope

I
wanna
go

let's
get
it
done
I'm

on
with
the

What?

wants
me

You're
shitting

How
cool
is
this?

GEORGIA:
Joy
said
I
just
found
out
that
at
a
CBS
affiliate
in
Craig
Ferguson
You
can't
be
serious.
If
Bob
and
Harold
find
out
Now,
I
need
you
to
fly
out
there
I'm
going
to
Lake
Tahoe
Just
don't
let
him
know
Go
ahead
and
let
him
do
the
and
then
convince
him
for
the
next
three
years.

ABBY:
I'm
gonna
try
to
catch
him
Okay.
I'll
call
you
back.
Thank
you.
Hello,
You'd
be
on
cable
access
Hear
you
wanna
move
to
CBS.
Is
everything
okay,
miss?
Yes,
I'm
just--
Abby?
I
thought
you
were
Oh.
You
couldn't
spend
a
day
Oh,
yes.
I
just
can't
get
enough
Stuart
thought
you
needed
than
I
needed
to
get
laid.
So
come
on,
I
gotta
check
in.
Wow.
Five
minutes.
MIKE:
ABBY:
Okay,
uh,
so
let's
go
over
I'm
sorry
you
didn't
get
with
little
Colin
And
by
"little,"
although
I
highly
suspect
Colin's
penis.
That's
what
Because
I
thought
maybe
what
you're
gonna
say
Yeah.
Okay.

So
tell
me,
Mike,
Uh,
well,
I
had
a
sales
job
where
I
was
driving
around
I
started
calling
in,
and
then
I
realized
Just
ask
my
producer,
Abby.
She
thinks
when
she's
not

have
been
enriched
Excuse
me,
lady,
but
you
have
a
boyfriend
It
may
have
started
but
it's
lasted
because
of
me.
Great.
your
normal
control-freak
I
am
not
a
control
freak.
When
you
checked
did
you
or
did
you
not
an
eastern-facing
room
I
like
rising
with
the
sun,

My
point
is,
that
Colin
likes
not
the
Abby
version
So
don't
go
knocking
when
you're
living
proof
I
could
be
Right
this
way,
please.
Dude,
this
is
awesome.
You
are
about
to
go
on
Okay,
this
isn't
helping,
Just,
you
know,
What
do
I
always
do?
You,
uh--
You
entertain
millions
of
people
and
they
love
you
for
it.
I
think
that
may
be
the
nicest
You're
welcome.
here
to
tell
us
the
ugly
truth
is
Mike
Chadway,
everybody.

Mike,
Mike,
Mike.
Come
on
up.
MIKE:
FERGUSON:
Now,
listen.
Men,
we
men,
Not
necessarily
"wee"
men,
No,
I
get
it.
I
get
it.
We're
not
known
for
in
matters
of
the
heart.
But
I
hear
you
have
some
very
What
advice
would
you
give
that
are
My
advice
would
be,
uh:
Don't
do
it.

I
mean,
It's
a
lot
easier
Blue
balls,
but
a
broken
heart,

Goodness
me.
Tell
me,
then.
Who?
FERGUSON:
Ah.
Well,
like
I
said,
[LOS

"SOLUNA"
Hi.
I
was
looking
STUART
:
I'm
working
on
it.
I
gotta
go.
Where's
Rick?
I
thought
maybe
you
and
I
Here.
Give
me
some
of
that.
And,
uh,
what
exactly
Hello?
Craig
Ferguson?
I
mean,
maybe
you
saw
it?
I
heard
about
Well,
then
maybe
you
heard
You
did?
Why?
Jonah.
You
know,
I
may
not
be
the
best
but
I'm
the
only
one
he's
got.
And
I
don't
wanna
half-ass
it

I
think
that's
Thank
you.
Now,
can
we
stop
and
maybe
relax
God.
Tell
me
about
the
doozy.
You
know,
the
woman
You
are
just
totally
No,
I'm
not.
I'm
just
interested

it
was,
uh--
It
was
more
like
a
parade.

depressed
girls,

it
turned
out,

the
time
I
hit
30,
you
can
only
have
before
you
figure
out
there's
no
such
thing
Oh,
come
on.
You
can't
really
as
a
good
relationship.
Mm.
To
my
very
core.
Hello.
Can
I
I'll
have
one
of
those,

Would
you
like
anything
else?
Okay,
would
you
like
Tap

Thanks.
What?
What?
It's
the
exact
same
thing,
So
I've
been
told.

Come
on,
let's
dance.

seen
your

What
the

was
that?
Why
do
I
wanna
do
it
again?

Miss
me?
You
were
expecting
No.
Mm.
Since
you
couldn't
I
decided
to
come
to
you.
Oh.
How
did
you

Joy
told
me.
I
just
started
all
the
stuff
we
were
Come
here.
A
little
champagne?
Great.
So
happy
to
be
here.
What's
wrong?
Nothing.
You
told
me
you
were
Yes,
I
did.
Have
a
little
something
else
You
are
going
to
love
it.

Oh!
Whoa!
Ha-ha!
Let
me
tell
you,
Oh,
wow,
I
guess
we'll
have
to
I'll
get
you
a
towel.

Abby,
I--

Abby,
I
really,
and
not
just
tonight.
Fuck!

fuck,
fuck.
Man
up,
Chadway.
Hey,
hey.
How
you
doing,
man?
Hey.
Good
to
see
you.
I
just
came
by
to
tell
in
our
flight
time,
but
I
can
come
by
later.
Hi.
Hey.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Uh,
flight's
changed.
Eight
o'clock
in
the
morning.
I-I
told
you
that
already?
Uh,
I'm
so--
Okay,
I'll
just
leave
now.
Mike.

Hey,
wait.
He
came
to
surprise
me.
I...
Hey,
how
convenient.
No,
I--
I
thought
it
was
you
Well,
I
guess
we're
all
I
taught
you
well.
Hey,
maybe
you
could
Tell
me
what
happened
Should
I
tell
Colin
to
go?
No.
No,
why
pull
up
anchor
now?
I
mean,
you
worked
damn
hard
And
that's
it?
What
do
you
want
me
to
say?
The
truth
is
ugly,
isn't
it?

That's
what
I've
been
Hm.
I'll
see
you.



Sorry
about
that.
No.
Honestly,
no
worries.
Just
come
here.
Listen,
the
rest
To
the
first

Uh...
Okay.
Mm.
Yeah.
Colin,
why
do
you
like
me?
Oh,
heh.
Wow.
Uh...
You're
beautiful.
You're
smart.
You,
uh--
You
never
criticize.
You
know
what?
You
never
And
I've
gotta
say,
because
I
know
so
many
women
and
it's
a
nightmare.
And
I
just
love
that
But
I
am.
I
am
just
like
that.
Wait,
what
do
you
mean?
Well,
this
should
be
chilled.
And
you
know
that.
And,
uh,
I
was
editing
that
speech
the
entire
time
And
the
time
you
fed
me
caviar,
I
was
in
physical
pain.
I
hate
being
fed
That's
how
much
But
I
couldn't
show
you
who
would
love
No
one.

Um...

I'm
so
sorry.
You
are
a
great
guy,
Which
is
why
I
have
to

did
you
do
to
him?
I
didn't
do
anything.

missed

quit

better
be

end

Not
really.
I'm

I
can't

so
we'll
do

about
how
often

Check
it
out.
GEORGIA:
--Jack

How's
it
going
out
there?
JACK:
so
you
can
learn
how
Well,
let
me
assure
you,
You're
looking
at
a
guy
who
personally
has
had
sex
Most
of
them
conscious.

This
is
beautiful.
Now,
we're
here
and
I'm
supposed
how
men
are
full
of
hot
air.
But
I
think
we
all
know,
it's
the
ladies
Just
because
she
says
no,

I'd
have
only
90
women--

Okay.
All
right.
What
the

Oh.

is

Yes,

Yes,

Mike

He
up
and
quit

think
you
know
what

when
it
comes
right
down
where
they
actually

I
don't

they
chicken
out.
Oh.
I
am
all
over
this.
JOE:
Where
are
you
going?
It's
going
great,
isn't
it?
The
big,
strong,
brave
men
that
we've
all
been
in
novels
and
watching
in
movies
that's
a
fallacy.
Men
are
not
strong.
Men
are
afraid.
It's
all
part
of
the
show.
Sort
of
an
Andy
Kaufman
Even
if
they
have
a
moment

and
it's
totally
romantic
men
are
incapable
Because
why?
Men
are
weak.
Let
me
tell
you
something
Oh.
Hey.

would
have
us
believe
That
we
break
CLIFF:
I
thought
he
quit.
See,
Bob?
They
say
they
want
true
love,
but
all
they
want
Is
he
perfect?
Is
he
handsome?
For
you
men
who
fit
don't
kid
yourselves,
They're
sleeping
with
set
of
venal
choices.
Money
over
substance,
Polish
over
principles.
No
gesture,
will
ever
compensate
for
a
really
impressive
list
This
coming
from
a
man
other
than
this
one.
Oh,
