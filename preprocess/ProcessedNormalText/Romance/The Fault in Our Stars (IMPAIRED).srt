HAZEL:
I
believe
we
have
a
choice
in
On
the
one
hand,
The
way
they
do
in
movies
where
beautiful
people
where
nothing
is
too
messed
with
an
apology
I
like
that
version
as
much
believe
me.
It's
just
not
the
truth.
This
is
the
truth.
Sorry.
Late
in
the
winter
my
mother
decided

She
just
eats
like
a
bird,
I
am
not
depressed,
Mom.
She's
reading
the
same
She's
depressed.
I'm
not
depressed.
The
booklets
and
the
websites
a
side
effect
of
cancer.

Depression's
not
It's
a
side
effect
of
dying.
Which
is
what
was
happening
to
me.


I
may
switch
you
to
Zoloft.
Or
Lexapro.
And
twice
a
day
instead
of
once.
-
Why
stop
there?
Really,
just
keep
them
coming.
I'm
like
the
Keith
Richards
Have
you
been
going
to
that
Yeah,
it's
not
my
thing.
Support
groups
can
be
a
great
way
for
you
to
connect
Who
are...
What?
on
the
same
journey.
"Journey"?
Really?
DR.
MARIA:
Give
it
a
chance.
Who
knows,
you
might
even

All
right.
Are
you
guys
ready?
We
are
gathered
here
today
literally
in
the
heart
of
Jesus.
We're
here
with
J.C.
Who
wants
to
share
their
I'm
Angel.
I
have
acute
myeloid
leukemia.
Sid.
Acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia.
Hi,
I'm
PJ.
Um,
I'm
Patrick.
Testicular.
HAZEL:
I'll
spare
you
the
gory
Basically,
they
found
it
they
cut
most
of
it
out,
and
he
So
now,
here
he
is,
living
on
his
parents'
couch...
exploiting
his
cancer-tastic
Literally.
To
show
us
that
one
day,
we
could
be
just
like
him.
Who's
next?

Hazel?

Um...
I'm
Hazel.
Uh,
thyroid,
originally...
but
now
with
quite
the
impressive
satellite
colony
in
my
lungs.

Uh,
you
mean
besides
All
right,
I
guess.
ALL:
We're
here
for
you,
Hazel.
Why
don't
I
play
another
song?


Christ
is
our
friend
And
he'll
be
there
till
the
end
Christ
is
our
friend
And
he'll
be
there
till

Christ
Hey,
sweet
pea.
So...
was
it
awesome?
"Yeah,
Mom,
it
was
awesome!"

HAZEL:
And
that
was
my
life.
Reality
shows.
Doctor's
appointments.
Eight
prescription
drugs,
But
worst,
worst,
worst
of
all...
Support
group.
-
You
cannot
make
me.
We're
your
parents.
Come
on,
we've
been
through
this.
You
need
to
go.
You
need
to
make
friends,
Mom,
if
you
want
me
you
don't
send
me
to
support
group.
You
gotta
get
me
a
fake
ID
and
drink
gimlets
and
take
pot.
Uh,
you
don't
"take"
pot.

Well,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
-



HAZEL:
And
so
I
went.
Not
because
I
wanted
to,
or
because
but
for
the
same
reason
To
make
my
parents
happy.
I
really
don't
understand
It's
not
like
you're
You're
just
gonna
sit
here
Of
course
I'm
not.
No,
I've
got
stuff
to
do.
Yeah.
I
love
you.
I
love
you,
too.
Have
fun.
HAZEL:
The
only
thing
worse
is
having
a
kid
Hey!
Make
some
friends.

Oh,
sorry.
-
I'll
take
the
stairs.
Thank
you.
-

My
bad.
I'm
sorry.
Oh,
my
God.
PATRICK:
Does
anyone
want
to
start?
Go
ahead.
I'm
Beth.
I
have
It's
been
an
okay
week.

PATRICK:
Isaac,
I
know
that
you're
Do
you
want
to
share
Or
maybe
your
friend,
here?
ISAAC:
No,
I'll
share.
Hey,
guys.
Uh...
Hi,
I'm
Isaac.
I
have
retinoblastoma.
We
had
surgery
on
one
eye
so
this
is
a
glass
eye.
And
then
I'm
going
in
to
the
to
take
out
the
other
eye.
So,
after
that
surgery,
I'm
But
I'm
lucky,
because
I
have
this

way
out
of
my
league.
Monica.
And
I
have
great
friends
like
So,
that's
what's
up.
Thanks.
ALL:
We're
here
for
you,
Isaac.
Thank
you.
Your
turn,
Gus.
Yeah,
sure.
Um,
I'm
Augustus
Waters.
I'm
18
years
old
and
I
had
a
touch
of
osteosarcoma
So,
I've
lost
this
baby
And,
uh,
now
I'm
part
But,
really,
I'm
just
And
how
are
you
feeling,
Gus?
I'm
grand,
yeah.
I'm
on
a
roller
coaster
that
Maybe
you'd
like
to
share
GUS:
My
fears?
Oblivion.
PATRICK:
Oblivion?
GUS:
Yeah.
You
see,
I
intend
to
live
To
be
remembered.
So,
I'd
say
if
I
have
any
fears,
it
would
be
to
not
do
that.
Would
anyone
else
in
the
Hazel?
Unexpected.
I
just
want
to
say
come
a
time
when
There
was
a
time
before
humans
and
there's
gonna
be
a
time
after.
It
could
be
tomorrow,
it
could
And
when
it
does,
to
remember
Cleopatra
or
let
alone
any
of
us.
Oblivion's
inevitable.
And
if
that
scares
you,
then
God
knows
it's
what

Well,
that's
some
good
advice.
And
I
like
all
this
because
it's
-
Thank
you.
-
Always.

MONICA:
Always.
"Literally."
I
thought
we
were

apparently
we
were

Oh,
yeah.
What's
your
name?
Hazel.
No,
what's
your
full
name?
Hazel
Grace
Lancaster.
What?
I
didn't
say
anything.
Why
are
you
looking
Because
you're
beautiful.
Oh,
my
God.
I
enjoy
looking

not
to
deny
myself

as
you
we're
all
gonna
die
pretty
soon.
Okay,
well,
that's
great.
Hey,
Gus.
Hi,
Lisa.
ISAAC:
MONICA:
Okay.
Always.
-
Always.
What
is
with
the

"Always"
is,

their
thing.
They'll

love
They
probably
texted

to

Let's
go
watch
a
movie.

What?
Huh?

Um...
I'm
free
later
this
week,
No,
I
mean

You
could
be
an
axe
murderer.
There's
always
that
possibility.
Come
on,
Hazel
Grace.
I
don't...
Really?
That
is
disgusting.
What?
What,
do
you
think
that
You
just
ruined
this
whole
thing.

The

thing?
Oh,
man.
Ugh.
And
you

There's

me
just
tell
you
that

totally
sucks.

It's
a
fatal
flaw.
Ah,
a
fatal...
Hazel
Grace,
they
don't
actually
hurt
Hmm?
I've
never
lit
one.
It's
a
metaphor,
see?
You
put
the
thing
that
does
the
but
you
never
give
it
A
metaphor.

Hey,
sweetheart.
No.
Uh...
I've
made
plans
-

-

Ooh!
Yeah,
I
failed
my
test
You
don't
say.
Actually,
the
fourth
time
it
was
going
about
And
when
it
was
over...
the
instructor
looks
over

unpleasant,

Total
cancer
perk.
So,
tell
me
about
you.
Um,
I
was
13
when
they
found
it.
Pretty
much
worst-case
scenario.
Thyroid,
stage
four.
Not
much
they
could
do.
Which
didn't
stop
them,
of
course.
Surgery.
Radiation.
Chemo.
More
radiation.
All
of
which
worked
for
a
while.
But,
then
stopped
working.

And
then
one
day,
my
lungs
Nurse!
We
need
a
nurse
right
now!
HAZEL:
I
couldn't
breathe.
No
one
could
get
it
under
control.
You
can
let
go,
sweetie.

Don't
be
afraid.
HAZEL:
That
should
have

HAZEL:
But
then
something
The
antibiotics
kicked
in.
They
drained
the
fluid
I
got
some
strength
back.
Next
thing
I
know,
I
found
You
know,
the
ones
that
are
famous
in
the
Republic
of

called
Phalanxifor.
It
didn't
work
in
over
but
for
some
reason
So,
they
called
it
Of
course,
my
lungs
still
but,
theoretically,
they
could
for,
I
don't
know,
a
while
maybe.
So,
are
you
back
in
school?
I
got
my
GED,
so
I'm
Whoa!
A
college
girl!
Well,
that
explains
Oh!
Careful!
Oops.

Welcome
to
my
humble
abode.
Uh,
my
folks
call
them
Don't
ask.

Hi,
guys!
-
Hey!
New
friend?
Yeah.
This
is
Hazel
Grace.
Hey.
Oh,
it's
just
"Hazel."
MR.
WATERS:
Hi,
Hazel,
how
are
you?
Yeah,
we're
going
downstairs.
Bye.
-
Nice
to
meet
you
guys.
This
is
it.
Augusto
World.
This
is
my
room.
Wow.
It's
an
impressive
collection.
Yeah,
I
used
to
play.

Do
you
mind
if
I
sit
down?
Yeah.
Make
yourself
at
home.
Mi
casa
es
tu
casa.

Sorry,
the,
um,
stairs...
and
the
standing...
Yeah,
I
understand.

Seriously,
are
you
okay?
Yeah,
yeah.
All
right.
What's
your
story?
I
already
told
you.
I
was
diagnosed
when
I
was
13...
No,
no,
no.
Not
your
cancer
Your
interests,
your
hobbies,
your
passions,
your
weird
fetishes.
"Weird
fetishes"?
Think
of
something.
The
first
Something
you
love.
An
Imperial
Affliction.
Okay.
What's
that?
It's
a
novel.
It's
my
favorite
novel.
Wait,
does
it
have
zombies
in
it?
Zombies?
No!
Stormtroopers?
No,
it's
not
that
kind
of
a
book.
Okay,
what's
it
about?
Uh,
cancer.
It's
about
cancer?
But
not
like
that.
The
author,
his
name
He's
the
only
person
I've
ever
who,
A,
understands
what
but,
B,
hasn't
actually
died.
Okay.
I
will
read
this
horrible
book
that
does
not
include
And
in
exchange...
you
will
read
this.
This
haunting,
yet
brilliant
novelization
"Counterinsurgence."

Yeah,
don't
laugh.
It's
awesome.
It's
about
honor,
and
sacrifice,
It's
about
embracing
your
destiny,
and
leaving
a
mark
on
the
world.

HAZEL:
Well,
thank
you.
Wait,
your
hands
are
so
cold.
Well,
they're
not
so
much
cold
-
Hazel
Grace?
I
love
it
when
you

That's
different.
Did
he
give
it
to
you?
By
"it,"
do
you
mean
herpes?
Wow.
Yes,
I
did.
It's
a
mother's
dream.



Hey,
don't
worry.
Oh,
my
God,
Mom.
It's
not
a
big
deal.
Yeah.
We
just
hung
out,
it's
not

MICHAEL:
I

the

FRANNIE:
Mmm-hmm.

This
is
the

They're
good,

So,
do
they
eat
a

of

I
did
something
with

just
to

to

Well,
I
like
it.
BOTH:
We
should
do
it
every

-
FRANNIE:
Every
year.
FRANNIE:
I
know.
-
I
really
do
like
these.
Honey,
would
you
like
What?

GUS:
Hazel
Grace.
Welcome
to
the
sweet
torture
of
ISAAC:

Are
you
okay?
And
now
I'm
breaking
all
the
rules
Uh...
Me?
Yeah,
I
am,
however,
with
Isaac,
and...
Isaac,
does
Support
Group
Hazel
I've
been
wasting
all
my
time
Isaac!
Focus
on
me.
Been
wasting
all
my
time
How
fast
can
you
get
here?
Um...
Great.
Well,
I
gotta
run.
Bye.

Hello?
Hazel.
Isaac,
Hazel
Grace
from
the
-
HAZEL:
Hi.
Uh...
A
gentle
reminder...
Isaac's
in
the
midst
of
a
You
look
really
nice,
by
the
way.
I
like
this
color
on
you.
Thank
you.
Isaac.
Isaac,
Hazel's
here.
Hey,
Isaac.
Hey,
Hazel.

How
you
doing?
I'm
doing
okay.
It
seems
Isaac
and
Monica
are
-
Oh,
Isaac,
I'm
so
sorry.
Do
you
want
to
talk
about
it?
No,
I
just
want
to
cry
However,
you
know,
it
doesn't
if
you
have
any
sage
words
I
actually
think
that
his
"Pain
demands
to
be
felt."
You're
quoting
my
book.
She
said
she
wanted
to
break
up
because
she
couldn't
handle
it.
I'm
about
to
lose
my
eyesight,
I
kept
saying
"always"
to
her.
And
she
kept
talking
over
me
and
not
saying
it
back,
and...
It
was
like
I
was
gone
HAZEL:
You
know,
sometimes...
people
don't
understand
that
they're
making
ISAAC:
I
know,
but...
I
feel
like
such
a
loser.
I
still
have
her
necklace
on.
Take
it
off.
Dude,
take
that
off.
Yeah.
Here
we
go,
man.

Don't
hit
that,
don't
hit
that.
Uh...
-
Hit
this.



I've
been
wanting
to
call
but
I've
been
waiting
a
coherent
thought
about

One
second.
Isaac.
-

You
need
to
break
something.
Try
this.
-
The
trophy?
Are
you
sure?
I've
been
looking
for
a
way
to
tell
Go
to
town!

Always!
An
Imperial
Affliction.
Yes.
I'm
so
glad
that
you
liked
it.

Yes,
I
did.
I
know.
"Rather
abrupt"?
Are
you
kidding?
I
mean,
I
understand
but
there's
an
unwritten
-
Gus?
-
Cool?
Between
author
and
reader.
And
I
feel
like
ending
your
book
violates
that
contract,
Okay,
yes.
I
know
what
you
mean...
but,
to
be
completely
honest,
I
think
it's
just
so
truthful.
You
just
die
in
the
middle
of
life.
You
die
in
the
middle

And,
I
don't
know...
But
I
really
would
like
to
know
what
happens
to
everyone
Like
Anna's
mother.
Yes,
and
the
Dutch
Tulip
Man.
And
Sisyphus
the
Hamster.
Yes!

Have
you
tried
contacting
I've
written
him
so
many
letters,
but
he's
never
responded.
Apparently,
he
moved
to
Amsterdam
and
became
a
recluse,
and...
-
Shame.
Isaac...
You
feeling
better,
buddy?
That's
the
thing
about
pain.
It
demands
to
be
felt.

I
cannot
stop
thinking

You're
welcome.
However,
we
do
need
closure,
That
is
exactly
what
I
was
asking
Van

for
in
my
letters.
But
he
never
responded.
Um,
nope.
"Dear

Is

Yeah,
I
guess
it
is.
I
should

go

Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Perhaps

Hey,
you,
I
am
so
sorry.
It's
okay.
Why
don't
you
just
ask
I
already
used
it.
What'd
you
use
it
on?
Not
Disney.
Hazel
Grace,
you
did
not

You
did
not
use
your
last
dying
wish...
to
go
to
Disney
World.
And
Epcot
Center.
Oh,
my
God.
It
was
actually
a
really
fun
trip!
That's
the
saddest
thing
I
met
Goofy!
Now
I'm
just
embarrassed.
Why
are
you
embarrassed?
I
can't
believe
I
have
a
crush
on
Terrible.
You
coming?
HAZEL:
The
most
important
is
to
lie
completely
still.
But
that
day,
Hey,
Gus!
How
are
you?
Hi,
Mrs.
Lancaster.
Hey.
Rik
Smits

-
Yeah,
it
is
indeed.
I'm
Augustus
Waters.
Nice
to
meet
you.

It's
good
to
see
you.
Good
to
see
you.
Hi,
Hazel
Grace.
Hi.
How
would
you
like
to
go
Um,
I
would
love
to
go
Shall
we?
No.

I
smell
like

So,

you're
a
survivor
yourself,
huh?
Yeah.
I
didn't

she's
gonna

that
kind
of
girl.
But
Ready,
Gus?
Yeah.
All
right.
See
you
soon.
All
right.
Oh!
Such
a
beautiful
day.
Yeah.
Is
this
where
you
take

Every
last
one
of
them.
That's
probably
why

You
are
not
still
a
virgin.
Are
you
really?
Let
me
show
you
something.

See
this
circle?
That
is
a
circle
of
virgins.
Uh-huh.
And
this...
is
18-year-old
dudes
with
one
leg.
-
Oh...
Funky

by
Joep
Van
Lieshout.
He
sounds
quite
Dutch.
And
he
is.
Much
like
Rik
Smits.
And
tulips.
Sandwich?
Let
me
guess.
Dutch
cheese
and
tomato.
-
Sorry,
the
tomatoes
are
Mexican.
How
dare
you!
Hmm.
How
cool
is
this?
They're
using
a
skeleton
Think
about
that.
You
do
love
your
symbols.
Speaking
of

why
you're
sitting
here

how
could

Hazel
Grace,
having
never

know
that
her
one
true
wish
was
in
his
Amsterdam
exile.
But
I
didn't
save
it,
so...
It's
a
good
thing
I
saved
mine.
So,
you're
saying...
I'm
not
gonna
give
you

If
that's
what
you're
thinking.
However...
I,
too,
have
an
interest
in

I
don't
really
think
to
meet
him
without

the
first

now,
would
it?
So
I
talked
to
the
Genies,
We
leave
in
a
month.
No.
Mmm-hmm.

Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God!
Augustus!
Thank
you!
Apparently,
they...
I
don't
know
but
they're
willing
to
That's
incredible.
Hazel,
that's
so
beautiful.
I
know.
And
a
little

Oh,
it's
super
insane.
It's...

just
met
you...

I
know!
Well,
we're
sharing
the
wish.
We're...

sweet.

What?
Is
he
your
boyfriend?
Is
that...
Stop
it!
Do
not...
Mom,
focus,

I
like
him
so
much.
I...
Pay
attention.
Please!
Can
I

just
might
work.

No

We're
so
relieved.
This
is
just
a
thing,
Hazel.
It's
a
thing
we
can
live
with.
Mr.
Lancaster.
How's
she
doing?
Better.
Yeah,
thank
you.
Uh,
they
won't
let
me
in.
Yeah,
sorry.
Yeah,
I
get
it.

Could
you

I
have
a
question.
Yes,
Hazel?
Can
I
still
go
to
Amsterdam?
-
That
would
not
be
wise
at
this
juncture.
Is
there

would

Hi.

again.
Sorry,
she's
asleep.
Yeah.
Uh,
okay.
All
right.
Bye-bye.
I
know
what
you're
thinking.
It's
not
fair
to
him.
It's
not.
He
doesn't
need
this
in
his
life.
Nobody
does.
A

it's

No,
you're

GUS:
Hazel
Grace.
Hi,
Augustus.
Are
you
okay?

No.
What's
the
matter?
Talk
to
me.

I
don't
know.
Everything.
I
want
to
go
to
Amsterdam,
Gus.
And
I
want
Van
Houten
to
tell
us
what
happens
after
his
book.
I
also
don't
really
want

I
mean,
it's
really
just
the
sky.
The
sky
is
making
me
sad.
And
there's
this
pathetic
that
my
dad
built
for
me
when
It's
just
everything,
I
guess.
Well,
I
demand
to
see
I
do
see
your
point.
This
is
one
sad
swing
set.
Hazel

I
hope
you
realize...
that

to

no

lessens
All
your

to

I
like
you.
And
I
like

I
can't

not?
Because
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you.

I
wouldn't
mind.

No,

don't
understand.
You
don't
understand.
I
know
what
you're
trying
to
say.
Hazel,
I'm
saying
I
wouldn't
mind.
It'd
be
a
privilege
to
have

I'm
a

One
day
I'm
gonna
explode...
and
I'm
gonna
obliterate

feel
like
to
minimize
the
casualties.
A

No.

I
guess
I
wouldn't

I
would
like
some
evidence.
What
about

Absolutely.
I

not

yes,
I
definitely

otherwise...
what's
the

Maybe
there
is
no

I
won't
accept
that.
I
am
in
love
with
you.
You
heard
me.
Augustus...
I
am
in
love
with
you.
And
I
know
that
love
is
just
and
that

is
inevitable.
And
that
we're
all
doomed...
and
that

Who's
ready
for
some
answers?
Me!

This
is
it.
I'm
so
excited,
As
opposed
to
normal?

Get
out
of
here.
VAN
HOUTEN:
Lidewij?
-
Hi!
-
Lidewij.
Please,
come
in.
Thank
you.
Peter!
They're
here!
VAN
HOUTEN:
They
are
Augustus
and
Hazel...
the
young
fans
with
whom
VAN
HOUTEN:
The
Americans?
LIDEWIJ:
You
invited
them.
Please,
come
in.
VAN
HOUTEN:
You
know
To
never
have
to
You're
American.
VAN
HOUTEN:
Incurably
so.
Get
rid
of
them.
LIDEWIJ:
I
will
not
do
this,
Peter.
Please,
be
nice.
Come
in,
please.
Sorry,
let
me
clear
this
for
you.
Thank
you.
Which
of
you
is
Augustus
Waters?
I
am.
And
that's
Hazel.
Mr.
Van
Houten,
thank
you
so
Clearly
an
error
in
judgment.
Yours
are
the
first
missives
and
look
where
it
got
me.
Scotch?
Uh...
No,
thank
you.
Just
me,
then,
Lidewij.
Another
scotch
and
soda,
please.
Perhaps
some
She
thinks
I
have
I
also
think
the
Earth
is
round.

So,
you
like
my
book.
-
We
love
your
book.
We
love
it.
Augustus...
He
made
his
wish
meeting
-
GUS:
No
pressure.
Did
you
dress
like
her
on
purpose?
Kind
of.
And,
incidentally,
sir,
wanted
to
thank
you
And
for
the
champagne.
It
was
amazing.
It
was
magical.
We
bought
them
dinner
last
night?
It
was
our
pleasure.
VAN
HOUTEN:
You've
come
a
long
way.
What
can
I
do
for
you?
We
have
some
questions...
obviously,
about
what
happens
Uh,
specifically
to
those
Like
her
mom,
How
familiar
are
you
I
would
say,
limited.
Uh,
Lidewij,
play
Okay.

We
don't
speak
Swedish,
sir.
Who
the
hell
speaks
Swedish?
The
important
thing
is
not
what
but
what
the
voices
are
feeling.

Are
you
messing
with
us?
Like,
is
this
some
Gus,

down.
All
right,
so
at
the
end
Let's
imagine
The
tortoise
has
In
the

it
takes

the
tortoise
has

maybe
You're
faster
than
the
tortoise,
but
you
can
never
You
can
only
decrease
his
lead.
Now,
certainly,
you
can
as
long
as
you
don't
contemplate
But
the
question
of
"how?"
turns
out
to
be
so
complicated...
that
no
one
really
solved
it...
until
Cantor's
proof
are
bigger
than
other
infinities.
I
assume
that

I'm
sorry.

Can
we,
for
one
second,
Please?
I
understand
that
the
story
ends
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence...
because
she
dies,
or
that
she
I
am
not
interested
in
But
that
doesn't
mean
that

I
said
I'm
not

But

promised!
Nothing

They're

HAZEL:
But
they
can't!
I
get
it
in
a
literary
sense
VAN
HOUTEN:
It's
impossible
I
will
not
indulge
I
refuse
to
pity
you
in
the
manner
in
which
you
are
accustomed.
-
I
do
not
want
your
pity!
Like
all
sick
kids,
your

You
are
fated
to
live
out
your
days...
as
the
child
you
were
A
child
who
believes
there
is
And
we
as
adults,
we
pity
this.
So,
we
pay
for
your
treatments,
Peter,
that's
enough.
You
are
a
side-effect
that
cares
little
You
are
a
failed
Listen,
douchepants...
there
is
nothing
that
you're
gonna
that
I
don't
already
know.
I
came
here
for
one
thing
That
is
for
you
at
the
end
of
this
goddamn
book!
I
can't
tell
you.
-
Bullshit!
-
Then
make
something
up!
I
want
you
to
leave.

Have
you
ever
stopped
why
you
care
so
much
Oh,
go
fuck
yourself.


Hey,
it's
okay.
It's
okay.
I'll
write
you
a
sequel.
All
right?
I'll
write
you
a
sequel.
It'll
be
better
than
any

You'll
love
it.

sorry
that
I
spent

you
did
not
spend
it
on

LIDEWIJ:
Hazel
and
Augustus!
I'm
very
sorry.
Circumstance
has
made
him
cruel.
I
thought

you
that
he
could
see
that

But...
I'm
very
sorry.
Perhaps
we
can
do
some
sightseeing?
Have
you
been

I'm
not
going
anywhere
No.
He
is
not
invited.


I'm
afraid
there's
no

Oh.
That's
all
right.
There
are
many

Steep

So,
I
was
hoping

mostly
you...
would
be,

kind
enough
to
whip
something
up.
I
would
love
to
do
that.

Thank
you.
You

are
cute.
Makes
me
sick.

You

are
gross.
Have
you
heard
from

Nope,
not
a

Nervous?
Is

Yes.

Yes!

Augustus?

Hi.
Oh,

I

you.
I'm
at
the

You're
what?
Something
is
wrong.
You
gotta...
Can
you
come?
Gus!
Gus.
Babe,
what's
going
on?
GUS:
Look.
Gus,
it's
infected.

Gus,
I
have
to
call
somebody.
No,
no.
Please
don't
Don't
call
my
parents
or
9...
I
will
never
forgive
you
Gus,
what
are
you
doing
here?
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
wanted
to
buy
cigarettes.
I
don't
know
what
I
might
have
lost
it
or
something,
or
they
took
it,
but
I
just...
I
wanted
to
do
something
I
wanted
to
do
it
myself.
-
I
have
to
call
9-1-1.
I
have
to.
No!
Hi,
9-1-1?
I
hate
myself!
My

is

We're
in

at

station.
HAZEL:
I
wish
I
could

his
sense
of
That
not
for
a
single
moment
But
that
is
not
what
happened.
-
It
hurts
so
much.
I'm
so
stupid.
Baby,
it's
okay.
It's
okay.
Hazel?
Will
you
tell
me
a
story?
A
story?
Or,
like,
a
poem?
I
do
know...
I...
I
know
a
poem.
Will
you
tell
me
it?
The
Red
Wheelbarrow
"So
much
depends
upon
"Glazed
with
rain
water
"beside
the
white
chickens."
That's
it?
Is
that
all?
No,
no,
no,
of
course
not.
"So
much
depends
upon...

so

How's
he
doing?
He's
had
a
tough
night,
Hazel.
His
blood
pressure's
low.
His
heart...

What
about
the
chemo?
They
are
gonna
stop
the
chemo.
Can
I
see
him?
We'll
tell
him
you
were
here.

Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm

MRS.
WATERS:
Take
your
time.
Here
we
go,

-
Good?
Okay.
HAZEL:
Hi.
What
are
you
thinking
about?
Oblivion.
I
know
it's
kid's
stuff
I
always
thought
I
would
be
a
hero.
I
always
thought
I'd
have
You
know,
something
they
would
I
mean,
I
was
supposed
You
are
special,
Augustus.
Yeah,
I
know.
But...
you
know
what
I
mean.
I
do
know
what
you
mean,
You
know
this
obsession
you
-
Don't
get
mad.
I'm
mad
because
I
think
you're
You
think
that
the
only
way
is
for
everyone
to
remember
Guess
what,
Gus.
This
is
all
you
get.
You
get
me,
and
you
get
this
world,
And
if
that's
not
enough
for
you,
then
I'm
sorry,
Because
I
love
you.
And
I'm
gonna
remember
you.
I'm
sorry.
You're
right.
I
just
wish
you
Hey.
It's
a
good
life,
Hazel
Grace.
It's
not
over
yet,
you
know.
Oh,
Augustus.
HAZEL:
One
of
the
less
bullshitty
is
the
convention
known
as
when
it
seems
like
the
inexorable
when
the
pain
is,
The
problem,
of
course,
is
that
that
your
last
good
day
At
the
time,
it's
just

Hello,
Augustus.

A
quick
question
for
you.
Did
you
ever
write
that
eulogy
I
may
have.
Do
you
think
you
could
to
the
literal
Heart
of
Jesus
Maybe.
Is
everything
okay?
I
love
you,
Hazel
Grace.
-
HAZEL:
Can
I
have
the
keys?
-
Where
you
going?
We're
gonna
eat
something.
Hazel,
you
have
to
be
hungry.
I'm
just
not
hungry.
Hazel,
you
cannot
not
eat.
I'm
aggressively
un-hungry.
Hazel,
I
know
Gus
is
sick,
but
you
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
Gus.
Well,
then
you've
Come
on,
just
eat
something,
honey.
"Stay
healthy"?
Okay,
I'm
not
healthy,
Do
you
realize
that?
I'm
dying,
and
you're
not
gonna
have
anyone
and
you're
not
gonna
be
a
mother
but
there's
nothing
So,
can
I
please
go?
Why
would
you
say
that
to
me?
Because
you
said
that.
What
are
you
talking
about?
In
the
ICU.
Hazel...
That's
not
the
truth.
All
right?
Even
if
you
died...
"When."
Even
when
you
die...
I'll
always
be
your
mother.
It's
the
greatest
That
is
my
biggest
fear,
Mom.
When
I
am
gone...
you're
not
gonna
You're
just
gonna
sit
and
or
you're
gonna
Hazel,
honey,
Losing
you...

That
is
gonna
hurt
like
hell.
But
you
of
all
people
know
it's
You
just
do
it.
I'm
taking
classes
in
social
work.
Wait,
you're
what?
Yeah,
um...
You
know,
if
I
can
take
and
help
other
people,
Mom,
how
could
you
We
didn't
want
you
Feel
abandoned?
You
guys,
this
is...

You
go.
Okay?
Baby.
GUS:
Straight
ahead,
yeah.
To
your
left,
a
little
bit.
That's
a
step,
right?
Yeah,
put
your
hand
out.
There's
a
podium
to
your
right.
Yeah,
perfect.


Beautiful.

Hi.
You're
late.
How
you
doing?
You
look
I
know,
right?
What's
going
on,
guys?
Tell
her,
Gus.
I
wanted
to
attend
my
own
funeral.
I
mean,
I'm
hopeful
that
I'll
be

However,
just
in
case
I
decided
to
plan
this
pre-funeral.

we
forgave
him.

of

because

19
years

Really?
I'm

you

when
the

come

they
tell
me
to
try
them
on...
I'm
gonna
tell
those

because

I
don't

Godspeed.
Yeah.
ISAAC:
To
the
right,
a
little
bit.
Yeah,
and
turn
around.
It's
down
to
you,
Hazel

Hello.
My

As

But,

my

I

you
for

Hold

You
gave
me

And
for

I

I

I

HAZEL:
Augustus
Waters
died
When
the
cancer,
stopped
his
heart,
which


It
was
unbearable.
The
whole
thing.
Every
second,
worse
than
the
last.
One
of
the
first
things
is
to
rate
your
pain
I've
been
asked
this
question
and
I
remember
once...
when
I
couldn't
catch
my
breath
and
it
felt
like
the
nurse
asked
me
Though
I
couldn't
speak,
Later,
when
I
started
the
nurse
came
in
"You
know
how
I
know?"
"You
called
a
ten
a
nine."
But
that
wasn't
the
truth.
I
didn't
call
it
a
nine
The
reason
I
called
it
a
nine
was
And
this
was
it.

was

Now,
we
are
going
to
hear
Hazel
Lancaster.
Not
that
it
really
matters,
There's
a
beautiful
quote

you

I
didn't

a
word.

But
that's
okay.
I
knew
this
was
Funerals,
I'd
decided,
They're
for
the
living.
Hey,
want
some
company?
No,
I'm
okay.
I'm
just
gonna
drive
Love
you.
Love
you.
You
spoke
beautifully.
I'll
see
you
soon.
Okay.

I?

Your
boy
Waters
and
I
corresponded
Oh.
So,
you
read
your
fan
mail
now?
I
wouldn't
exactly
call
him
a
fan.
He
detested
me.
But
he
was
quite
insistent
and
tell
you
what
became
so
here
I
am.
And
that's
your
answer,
"Life
comes
from
life."
I'm
really
not
in
the
mood.
You
don't
want
an
explanation?
No,
I
don't.
Thank
you,
though.
You
remind
me
of
her.

I
remind
a
lot
of
people
My
daughter
was
eight.
And
she
suffered
She
had
leukemia
like
Anna?
Just
like
Anna.
I'm
very
sorry
for
your
loss.
And
I'm
sorry
for
yours.
And
You
didn't
ruin
our
trip.
-
We
had
an
amazing
trip.
Are
you
familiar
with

a

my
God.
Hazel,
I'm
trying
to
I'm
trying
to
give
you
No,
you're
not!
You
are
a
drunk,
and
I
need
you
to
get
out
so
that
I
can
go
home,
and
You'll
want
to
read
this.
I
don't
want
to
read
anything.
Can
you
just
get
out
of
my
car?
Please
get
out
of
my
car!
Fine.



Can
I
come
in?
I'm
so,
so
sorry.
Yeah.
It
was
a
privilege,
To
love
him?
Gives
you
an
idea
FRANNIE:
Hazel?
There's
a
friend
here
to
see
you.

Apparently
he
was
struggling
and
then
eventually
It
wasn't
great
or
anything.
Dying
sucks.
Gus
really
loved
you,
you
know?
I
know.
-
He
wouldn't
shut
up
about
it.
Yeah.
It
was
annoying.
He
I
didn't
find
it
that
annoying.
I
know.
I
know
you
didn't.

Did
you
get
that
letter
Ew.
He's
not
my
friend.
How
do
you
know
about
that?
Well,
I
was
talking
and
he
said
he
came
all
this
way
Yeah,
well,
I'm
over
it.
I
have
no
interest
in
reading
another
No,
he
didn't
write
it.
What?
Apparently
Gus
wrote
something
down
and
then
sent
it
to
Van
Houten.
Oh,
my
God.
GUS:
Mr.
Van
Houten,
I'm
a
good
You're
a
shitty
person,
I
think
we'd
make
a
good
team.
I
don't
want
to
ask
you
but
if
you
have
the
time,
and
from
please
fix
this
for
me.
It's
a
eulogy
for
Hazel.
She
asked
me
to
write
one,
I
just...
I
could
See,
the
thing
is,
we
all
But
Hazel's
different.
Hazel
knows
the
truth.
She
didn't
want
a
million
admirers.
And
she
got
it.
Maybe
she
wasn't
loved
widely,
And
isn't
that
more
When
Hazel
was
sick,
but
I
didn't
want
to
say
so.
She
was
in
the
ICU,
and
I
and
I
sat
with
her,
Her
eyes
were
closed.
But
her
hands
Still
warm,
and
her
nails
were
painted
and
I
just
held
them.
And
I
willed
myself
to
imagine
and
what
a
worthless
world
She's
so
beautiful.
You
don't
get
tired
You
never
worry
if
she's
because
you
know
she
is.
She's
funny
without
I
love
her.
God,
I
love
her.
I'm
so
lucky
to
love
her,
You
don't
get
to
choose
if
but
you
do
have
a
say
And
I
like
my
choices.
I
hope
she
likes
hers.
Okay,
Hazel
Grace?
Okay.
