Snuggle
in,
sweetie!
It's
cold
out
there.
Why
is
it
snowing,
Grandma?
Oh,
that's
a
long
story,
sweetheart.
-
I
wanna
hear.
I'm
not
sleepy.
Tell
me,
please.
Well,
all
right.
Let's
see...
I
guess
it
would
have
to
start
with...
scissors!
Scissors?
Well,
there
are
all
kinds
of
scissors.
And
once
there
was
even
a
man
-
A
man?
-
Hands
scissors?
You
know
the
mansion
It's
haunted.
Well...
A
long
time
ago...
...an
inventor
lived
in
that
mansion.
He
made
many
things,
I
suppose.
He
also
created
a
man.
He
gave
him
insides,
Well,
almost
everything.
You
see,
the
inventor
was
very
old.
He
died
before
he
got
to
finish
So
the
man
was
left
by
himself...
...
incomplete
and
all
alone.

He
didn't
have
a
name?
Of
course
he
had
a
name.
His
name
was
Edward.

Avon
calling!
-
Weren't
you
just
here?
Today
I've
come
to
show
you
our
exquisite
...blushes
and
lipstick.
Everything
you
need
to
accent
and
highlight
My
changing
look...
That's
good!

I
also
have
a
complete
selection
...those
tried
and
true
products
we've
all
Come
on,
Peg,
I
know.
Bye,
Helen.
Um,
you
didn't
have
to
call
me,
ma'am.
I
could?
I
don't
think
so.
It's
easy.
Your
food
trap's
clogged,
that's
all.
See
this
bolt
here?
You
just
unscrew
this...
Mm-hm...
And
out
she
pops.
On
TV
they
say
you
repairmen
Housewives
get
lonely
too,
though
you
may
And
then
you
just
take
this
and
put
it
back
in
And
then
you
just
screw
this
back
on.
-

Will
you
excuse
me
for
a
moment?
Now,
don't
go
anywhere.
I'll
be
right
back.
I
wouldn't
wanna
miss
a
moment
of
it!
-
Good
morning,
Joyce.
Avon
calling!
Have
you
gone
blind?
Oh.
Yes.
Don't
you
realise
that
means
I'm
busy?
OK,
now
we
should
decide
on
lipsticks.
OK,
dear,
did
you
like
the
Winsome
Wahini,
...or
the
Bahimini
Bliss?
-
I
like
'em
both.
You
don't
actually
think



Ding-dong!
The
Avon
lady!
Just
not
my
day.


Oh,
my
goodness!
Oh,
it's
so
beautiful!
Hello?
Hello?

Hello?
Avon
calling!

Oh,
my!

Hello?
Hello?
I'm
Peg
Boggs.
I...
I'm
sorry
to
barge
in
like
this,
Ooh!
This
is
some
huge
house,
isn't
it?
Thank
goodness

Hello?
Hello?
Why
are
you
hiding
back
there?
You
don't
have
to
hide
from
me.
I'm
your
local
Avon
representative...
...and
I'm
as
harmless
as
cherry
pie...
Oh,
my!
I
can
see
that
I've
disturbed
you.
How
stupid
of
me.
I'll
just
be
going
now.
Don't
go.
Oh,
my!
What
happened
to
you?
-
I'm
not
finished.
Put
those
down.
Those
are
your
hands?
Those
are
your
hands!
What
happened
to
you?
Where
are
your
parents?
Um...
Your
mother?
Your
father?
He
didn't
wake
up.
Are
you
alone?
What
happened
to
your
face?
I
won't
hurt
you.
At
the
very
least,
This
will
help
to
prevent
infection.
What's
your
name?
Edward.
Edward...
I
think
you
should
just
come
home
with
me.
Ohh!
-
I'm...
I'm
sorry.
You
go
ahead
and
look.
Oh!
You
OK?
You
OK?

Hello?
Hi.
Yeah,
it's
Marge.
I
was
standing
outside
talking
to
Carol,
and
-
Did
you
get
a
good
look
at
him?
Did
she
say
anything
to
you
Nothing
at
all.
No...
OK,
I'll
meet
you
on
the
corner.
Right.
Bye.
-

Here
we
go,
dear.
This
is
our
house.
You
can
just
go
right
in
We'll
have
something
to
eat
or
drink,
or...
Here,
dear.
Here
we
go.
This
is
the
front
door.
Joyce?
I
just
saw
this
strange
guy
He
looked
kinda
pale.
On
my
way.
Don't
do
anything
without
me.
Yes!
Be
right
there!
Here
we
are.
So...
um,
this
is
the
living
room
You
want
to
see
the
pictures?
All
right.
Well,
this
is
my
husband
Bill.
Do
you
know
what
bowling
is?
Bowling?
No.
Well...
Here
they
are
I
think
Kevin
looks
a
little
glum
And,
um...
here's
my
daughter
Kim.
All
dressed
for
the
junior
prom.
She's
a
senior
now,
if
you
can
believe
it!
She's
camping
in
the
mountains
...but
she'll
be
back
in
a
few
days.
Isn't
she
beautiful?
That's
my
family.
Come
along.
Then
you
can
just
freshen
up
That's
the
kitchen
over
there.
Those
are
grapes.
Let
me
get
you
some
towels
You
know
what?
I
think
I
have
some
of
Here.
These
should
just
fit
you.
-

Now
you
can
go
in
Kim's
room

No,
no,
scissors.
No,
scissors.
That's
right.
Well,
he
was...
-
Have
you
seen
him
before?
Then
how
did
you
ever
get
together
with
him?
Listen,
I
have
to
go
now.

Sorry,
Edward,
I
didn't...
May
I
help
you
with
this?
Thank
you.
There
you
go.
Oh
dear,
you've
cut
your
face.
Here.
Let
me
just
get
this
right
off.
-
Does
that
hurt?
Good.
OK.
Now,
let's
get
you
dressed.
OK...
There
we
go.
Very
fine!
You
look
fine,
just
fine!
Helen,
come
on!
She
wouldn't
wait
for
you.
I've
got
rollers
in
my
damn
hair!
OK...
Now,
what
did
I
do
with
my
sciss?
Edward,
um...
would
you?
Thank
you.
You
know,
I
have
a
doctor
friend
-
Really?
Now,
I
can
help
with
the
scars...
But
I
just
wanna
consult
the
big


Kevin!
Kevin!
It's
not
polite
to
stare,
dear.
Think
how
it
would
make
you
feel
-
I
wouldn't
care.
Well,
this
must
be
-
Edward,
dear.
I
think
he
prefers
Edward.
So
what
have
you
been
doin'
with
yourself
-
I
bet
the
view
must
be
spectacular,
huh,
Ed?
Yes?
No,
I...
I
just...
See
all
the
way
to
the
ocean,
I
bet,
huh?
Sometimes.
Bill,
could
I
have
the
salt
and
pepper,
please?
Bill,
dear,
could
I
have
Kevin!
Kevin!
Man,
those
things
are
cool!
I
bet
they're
razor-sharp.
Kevin!
Edward...
...would
you
like
some
butter
for
your
bread?
Great!
Thank
you.
Hey,
can
I
bring
him
to
Kevin,
I've
had
enough.
Do
you
think
you
can
sleep?
I
know
things
feel
strange,
-
Good
night.
The
light
concealing
cream
goes
on
first...
...then
you
blend
and
blend
and
blend.
Blending
is
the
secret.
Mm-hm!
More
concealing
cream...
Your
complexion
is
so
fair!
Now,
this
has
a
touch
of
lavender
in
it...
Give
it
a
try
here.
Close
enough!
OK,
this
should
do
the
trick
here.
Hmph!
I
have
another
idea.
We'll
cover
up
the
scars
Darn
this
stuff!

They
still
have
11
on
the
scoreboard,
It's
through
the
gap
to
Warren.
Now
they
change
it
to
12
hits.
Turn
it
up,
Kevin,
I
can't
hear
it!

Kevin!
-
It's
hammered!
-
No,
make
it
louder!
...
it's
out
of
here,
it's
history!

Dad...
Look!
...
to
make
it
a
five-run
inning
I'll
be
darned.


They
filled
the
whole
tape!

What's
going
on
over
there,
Peg?
Hi,
it's
Marge.
Who
is
he?
Call
me.
Oh,
by
the
way,
I
hear
it's
pouring
rain
in

Hey
there,
darlin'!
The
gals
are
You
can't
keep
him
a
secret
for
ever!



Well,
it's
just
wonderful,
Ed.
My
God,
And
he
answers
the
challenge
at
first
Edward,
come
here.
No,
no,
no,
that's
a
terrible
idea,
son!
Go
to
the
garage
and
get
the
oil
can.
Ohh!
Edward,
you
did
us!
-
Oh,
Bill,
it's
us!
Oh,
Edward!
It's
not
heaven
he's
from,
The
power
of
Satan
is
in
him,
I
can
feel
it.
-
Can't
you?
Have
you
sheep
strayed
so
far?
Don't
come
near
me.
-
That's
right.
Go
on,
get
outta
here,
run!
Edward,
don't
you
listen
to
her!
Don't
worry
about
her,
Edward.

Hi!
You-all
are
hidin'
in
there
like
hermit
crabs.
Hi,
Joyce.
Hi!
Shame
on
you,
We
think
that's
mighty
selfish
of
you.
Things
have
been
hectic
here.
That
is
so
sweet
of
you
What
time
does
the
barbecue
begin?
Barbecue?
You
intend
to
introduce
...don't
you?

And
I
will
bring
the
ambrosia
salad!
-
What
time
was
it
that
you
said?
-
Bill!
Bill!
He
has
been
sent
first
to
tempt
you!
But
it's
not
too
late.
Trample
down
the
perversion
of
nature.
Did
you
hear
that?
Why,
isn't
that
excitin'?

-
Bye-bye.

Bill!
Bill?
You
really
can't
have
a
picnic
or
a
barbecue
They're
just...
the
best.
They
make
a
thing.
Oh,
Edward,
that's
wonderful!
We're
gonna
be...
Oh.
All
right
now,
it's
just
a
nick.
There's
no
need
to
be
nervous,
dear.
Esmeralda
won't
be
here.
And
the
rest
of
There's
no
need
to
be
nervous.
You
just
have
to
be
yourself.
-
Myself?



-
Thanks,
Edward.
Play
scissors
what?
I
got
a
doctor
friend
-
He
did
them
just
like
that!
-
Hi,
Mike,
how
you
doin'?
Hey,
kids!
Hi,
George
Monroe.
That's
a
heck
of
Harry!
I
saw
you
Are
you
OK?
Do
you
want
something
to
eat?
Do
you
want
a
cracker?
-
He's
different.
No
kidding.
-
He's
so...
Yeah.
-
D'you
imagine
those
hands
are
hot
or
cold?
And
just
think
what
a
single
snip
could
do.
Or
undo.
Eddie.
Eddie.
The
guys
and
I
want
to
invite
you
Would
you
like
that?
Only
thing
is...
you
can't
cut!
I
have
my
own
infirmity.
Took
some
shrapnel
during
the
war,

Don't
you
ever
let
anybody
tell
you
Who's
handicapped?
My
goodness.
Don't
be
ridiculous!
What
do
they
call
the...
exceptional?
My
name's
Joyce,
and
I
noticed
that
you
...that
I
made
especially
for
you.
Allow
me.
Mmm!
Mmmm!
-
You
must
try
this.
It's
my
mother's
recipe.
With
a
green
thumb
like
yours,
I
want
a
row
of
angels!
I
am
so
sorry,
ladies,
but
he's
promised
to
-

I
did?
Soup's
on!

Azhuzhizha
zhigabab.
-
What?
It
is
shish
kebab.
It
was
a
figure
of
speech.
You
shouldn't
take
things
so
literally.

"Let
us
pretend
we
are
in
the
drawing
"Many
numerous
little
questions
"Should
the
man
rise
"May
lump
sugar
be
taken
with
the
fingers?"
No.
"Is
it
good
form
to
accept
a
second
cup?"
"Should
the
napkin
be
entirely
unfolded...
...or
should
the
centre
crease
"It
is
so
easy
to
commit
...but
etiquette
tells
us
...and
guards
us
from
all

Mm,
yes.
Boring.
Let
us
switch
to,
uh...
...to
some
poetry,
hm?
"There
was
an
old
man
from
the
Cape,"
"Who
made
himself
garments
of
crepe."
"When
asked:
Will
they
tear?"
"He
replied:
Here
and
there,"
"But
they
keep
such
a
beautiful
shape!"

That's
right.
Go
ahead,
smile.
It's
funny.

That's
right.

We're
home.
-

Everything's
still
sopping.
-
I
can
hardly
wait
to
take
a
shower.
If
my
parents
have
the
alarm
set,
I
told
you
to
call
them
-
But
did
you?
How
else
am
I
supposed
to
get
attention?
-
You
didn't
call
your
parents.
-
Bye.
Thanks
for
driving,
Denny.
-
Bye.
-
Don't
forget
your
arm!
Come
on,
Jim,
let's
go.



There's
somebody
in
my
room!
He's
a
murderer!
He's
got
an
axe!
-

Everything's
OK.
Go
back
to
bed,
Kevin.

This
way.

Edward's
come
to
live
with
us.
OK.
We'll
have
you
set
up
here
in
a
minute.
We
got
a
full
queen-size
bed
here,
Oh,
it's
all
made
and
everything.
Good.
There
you
go.
What's
the
matter?
What's
wrong?

She
get
you
nervous?
You've
been
cloistered
away
You
don't
know
about
the
wonderful
world
-
Here,
this'll
straighten
you
right
out.
Lemonade.
I
don't
know
what
it
is.
They
reach
a
certain
age...
They
develop
these
gland
things,
They
go
crazy.
Glands?
Yeah,
glands.
I
try
not
to
think
about
it.



Good,
isn't
it?
Now,
you
stay
in
Kevin's
room
tonight
Why
did
you
have
to
bring
him
here?
I
couldn't
have
left
him
all
alone.
Why
does
he
have
to
stay
here?
My
goodness,
Kim,
I'm
surprised
at
you.
-
Have
a
little
sympathy.
Then
say
a
little
greeting.
-
Shake
his
hand?!
-
Goodness,
you
scared
him
half
to
death!
Hi,
Bill!
I
just
wanted
you
two
Edward,
this
is
our
daughter
Kim.
Kim,
this
is
Edward,

Hi.
H-h-h...
H-h-h...


Eddie!
Thirsty?
-

Shh,
quiet
now!
Darlin',
I
can
hardly
hear
myself
think!

Aah!
Wouldn't
you
like
Lemonade?


One
chop
to
a
guy's
neck,
and
it's
all
over.
Sharpest
things
in
the
world.
And...


They
give
me
the
creeps.

You
should
see
the
clown
Kim!
-
Oh,
no.
-
He's
calling
you,
Kimba.

Edward,
you
forgot
your
cookies.
Don't
worry,
Eddie.
She's
waiting
for
ya!
-

Stop!
Bill,
Edward
had
lunch
at
Jackie's
today...
...and
she
just
had
-
I'll
be
darned.
...a
new
microwave,
new
silent
dishwasher...
Jim,
didn't
you
just
tell
me
Yeah,
my
dad
bought
himself
Big-screen
TV,
CD
players,
My
goodness
sake!
They
keep
things
locked
up.
My
father
has
his
own
room
for
his
stuff
He
won't
even
help
me
buy
an
old
car.
He
probably
wants
you
to
pay
for
it
yourself.

Dad!
Speaking
of
money...
I
understand
you're
Now,
Bill...
Marge
made
him
cookies
today.
Sweetheart...
You
can't
buy
You
can't
buy
a
car
with
cookies.
Uh,
that's
true,
sir,
you
can't.
I...
I
can't
eat
that.
He
used
his
hands.
It's...
I
don't
think
it's
sanitary.
I'm
sorry.

Honey,
you
want
me

No,
that's
OK.
I'll
be
right
back.

Alexis?
Oh,
this
can't
possibly
be
my
Alexis!
She
looks
so
beautiful!
Look
at
you!
Sweetie!
She's
gorgeous.
Thank
you!
It
won't
be
long.
And
then
it'll
be
fine.

I
was
hopin'
for
somethin'
big
Now
don't
you
worry,
Kisses,
you're
gonna
Yes,
you
are.
Oh!
Oh!
My!
Oh!
Ohh!
Oh!
Eddie,
is
there
anything
you
can't
do?
You
take
my
very
breath
away,
I
swear.
Have
you
ever
cut
a
woman's
hair?
Would
you
cut
mine?



That
was
the
single
most
thrillin'
experience
They're
getting
the
head
of
the
company!
-

I'm
home!
-
Hi.
What
did
you
do
to
your
hair?
Edward
cut
it.
Isn't
it
wild?
Hello?
Oh,
I
can't
believe
This
is
such
an
honour.
Yes.
He's
right
here.
So
then
you
know
all
about
it.
Uh-huh.
Well,
that's
exactly
Well,
I've
had
a
little
trouble
getting
it
I'll
try
that.
Uh-huh.
Well,
what
imaginative
suggestions.
I
sure
will.
Thank
you
so
much.
Bye-bye.
No
wonder
she's
the
head
of
the
company.
You
know,
she
started
out
as
I've
always
wanted
to
talk
to
her,
Thanks,
Edward.
-
She
had
some
ideas?
-
Uh-huh!
I'll
get
that.
Edward.
We're
here.
Come
on,
let's
get
you
sharpened
up.
-
You
got
it?
This
is
such
a
drag.
Hi!
-
Bye.
Do
you
have
a
key?
No.
-
I
could
have
sworn
they
were
in
my
purse.
Wow!
Thanks!
Ed!
What
a
guy!
Good
job.
Hey,
be
a
pal
and
yell
Quite
a
story,
yes?
Yeah?
Get
away
over.
Stand
right
up.
What's
been
the
best
part
The
friends
I've
made.

Any
other
questions?
Have
you
ever
thought
of
having
I
know
a
doctor
I'd
like
to
meet
him.
We'll
get
that
name
after
the
show.
Anyone
else?
Yes,
stand
right
up.
But
then
you'd
be
like
everyone
else.
Yes,
I
know.
I
think
he'd
like
that.
But
then
no
one
would
You
wouldn't
be
on
TV
or
anything.
No
matter
what,

More
questions?
Yes.
Stand
right
up.
Your
work
is
so
interesting,
Do
you
have
any
plans

Oh,
there's
an
idea!
Anyone
else?
Yeah.
Stand
right
up.
-
Do
you
have
a
girlfriend?
Sure
he
does.
Right,
Kim?
-

Right,
Kim?
Knock
it
off,
bubble-butt.
-
You
did
it.
How
about
it,
Edward?

Ooh...

Uh...
everything's
all
right.
We'll
take
a
break
Why
are
you
laughing?
He
got
hurt!
-
It
was
just
a
little
shock.
What
do
you
care?
I
wish
we'd
been
taping
that.
Aren't
you
excited?
This
is
so
thrillin'!
Wait
till
I
show
it
to
you.
It's
just
perfect.
I
wanna
call
it
Shear
Heaven!

Ohh!
And
here
we
are.
Now,
all
along
here
And
back
along
here,
well,
I
think...
Eddie!
Come
along,
doll.
Back
up
here
a
whole
row
of
new
cosmetics.
-
Peg
could
sell
cosmetics.
And
this
of
course
And
here
is
where
I
stand...
But
back
in
here

Eddie...
This
is
what
Now,
this
is
the
storeroom
...and
what
I
need
from
you
today
Oh,
honey,
no!
No,
don't.
That's
dangerous.
Now,
you
just
sit
right
down
there...
I
have
some
smocks.
Yes.

OK.

#
With
these
hands
#
I
will
cling
to
you
#
I'm
yours
for
ever
#
And
a
day
Now,
this
is
my
favourite.
Because
it's
yellow...
And
what
it's
for...
...
is
to
catch
those
itchy
little
And
then
there's
this
old
purple
one
...drape
around
you
like
this.
-
I
like
that
one.
Why,
Eddie,
you're
tremblin'.
So
am
I!
I've
been
waitin'
for
this
moment
for
so
long.
#
And
with
these
hands
#
I'll
provide
for
you
#
Should
there
be
a
stormy
sea
#
I'll
turn
the
tide
for
you
#
And
I'll
never
#
Oh
no,
I'll
never
#
I'll
never
let
you
go

Aagghh!
Edward!
Edward,
you
come
back
here!

Velcro,
sweetheart.
-
It
hangs
on
the
dashboard.
-
Sorry
I'm
late.
Sorry,
dear,
we
had
to
go
ahead
without
you.
So,
Edward,
did
you
have
a
productive
day?
Mrs
Monroe
showed
me
-
You
could
have
a
cosmetics
counter.
Great.
Then
she
showed
me
the
back
room
Edward,
I
can't
tell
you
how
thrilled
I
am.
This
venture's
gonna
teach
you
volumes.
There's
nothin'
like
I've
never
done
it
myself...
...but
I
gather
it's
the
greatest
satisfaction
So
I
guess
the
bank's
The
bank?
Yeah.
Take
out
a
loan,
get
yourself
started.
Nothin'
to
worry
about.
With
your
talent
Yeah.
No
credit...
...no
record
ofjobs
you've
held...
...no
savings...
...no
personal
investments...
No
social
security
number
-
-
There
is
no
collateral.
But
don't
the
testimonials
count?
Did
you
see
here
the
mayor's
wife
We
simply
can't
do
it.
Now,
get
yourself
a
social
security
card,
You
have
a
decided
advantage.
...and
park
anywhere
you
like.
I
can't
believe
it.
It's
just
an
outrage.
But
don't
you
worry.
This
isn't
the
end
of
it.
-

But
that's
breaking
and
entering.
What'll
it
cost
them?
-
We
can't.
I
don't
want
to.
You
don't
want
us
to
have
our
own
van
where
Why
can't
you
do
it?
Because
the
room's
locked
Can't
you
take
the
key
when
he's
sleeping?
The
only
thing
he
hangs
on
to
tighter
-
Razor
Blades'll
do
anything
for
you.
-
Oh,
no?
Why
don't
you
ask
him?
-
So
what?
There
isn't
any
other
way.
Look,
I've
racked
my
brain.
Don't
you
want
us
to
have
our
own
van?
Well...
yeah.

Jim,
the
lights
are
on!
Those
go
on
automatically.

In
case
of
burglars.
-

You
turned
off
the
alarm?

I
hate
this.

Are
you
sure
he
doesn't
know
-
This
person
stole
from
you?
I
told
you
he
stole
it,
OK?
Let's
go!
Tell
his
parents
Listen,
I
already
tried
that.
Come
on!
Come
on!
OK,
come
on.
Come
on.
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on!
Now!
Come
on!

The
bastard
had
it
wired
separately.
No,
Jim,
we
can'tjust
leave
him
here!
-
Come
on.
-
Just
come
on,
Kim.
Put
me
down!
Put
me
down!


We
know
you're
in
there!
We're
in
the
process
of
deactivating

-
Denny,
turn
around!
Jim,
they
can't
arrest
you
We'll
tell
'em
we
freaked
and
ran.
-
I'm
not
going
back
there,
OK?
No.
My
father
would
prosecute.
-
His
own
son?
And
if
Edward
tells
I'll
kill
him!
-
Denny,
turn
around!
You
have
to!
We
want
your
hands
high
in
the
air
Put
your
hands
up!
He's
holding
something.
Looks
like
knives.
Drop
your
weapons!
I
repeat-
drop
your
weapons!
I'm
gonna
ask
you
one
more
time.
If
you
fail
to
do
so
we'll
have
to
open
fire.
Drop
your
weapons.
Drop
'em!
Now!
Looks
like
we
got
a
psycho.
-
Prepare
to
fire!
-
Stand
back,
ladies!
Please.
We
know
him.
All
right.
Cuff
him.
-
But
we
can
see
him
now?
-
He
has
to
stay
in
prison
all
night?
Oh,
Edward!
Hello,
Edward.
Oh,
Edward,
dear.
I
blame
myself.

What
in
God's
name

Why
didn't
I
set
a
better
example?
What
were
you
gonna
do
with
that
stuff?
I
blithely
say
"We'll
get
money
...but
I
never
meant
stealing.
Dear,
stealing's
not
the
way
to
get
it.

Uh-uh.
Except
trouble.
Oh,
Edward.
Why
ever
did
you
do
this?
-
Damn
those
TV
programmes!
Or
did
somebody
put
you
up
to
this?
Will
he
be
OK,
doc?
The
years
spent
in
isolation
have
not
given
He's
had
no
context.
Furthermore
his
work,
the
garden
sculptures,
...indicate
that
he's
a
highly
imaginative...
...character.
His
awareness
of
what
we
call
reality
But
will
he
be
all
right
out
there?
Oh,
yeah.
He'll
be
fine.
Listen,
it
could
keep
me
up
all
night
worrying
I
happened
to
be
up,
All
along
I
felt
in
my
gut
-
It
could
have
been
my
house.
I
warned
you,
didn't
I?
You
didn't
heed
my
warning,
but
now
Edward,
you
stay
here.
-

What
do
you
say
in
your
defence?
-
He
doesn't
want
to
talk.
-
He
can't
talk
right
now.

So,
were
you
set
up?
Huh?
What
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself?
-

One
comment.
One
comment.
Goodness,
Lois,
it
looks
like
...before
I
get
you
over
for
your
haircut!
Well,
of
course
we're
gonna
have
it
this
year.
Well!
You
may
think
that,
but
you're
wrong.
You're
here.
They
didn't
hurt
you,
did
they?
Were
you
scared?
I
tried
to
make
Jim
go
back,
Thank
you
for
not
telling
them
that
we...
You're
welcome.
It
must
have
been
awful
I
knew
it
was
Jim's
house.
You...
you
did?
Yes.
Well,
then
why'd
you
do
it?
Because
you
asked
me
to.

Kimba!
Kimmy!

Hey!
-
Don't!
When
are
you
gonna
stop?
I
did
what
I
could.
My
old
man
thinks
he's
retarded,
so
he's
free.
-
You
could
tell
the
truth.
-
You
know
I
didn't
wanna
do
it.
I
don't
get
why
you
give
such
a
shit
anyway.


Maybe
there's
a
way
you
can
...but
our
confidence
in
you

Dad...
OK.
A
little
ethics.
You're
walkin'
down
There's
nobody
around.
No
human
person
A:
You
keep
the
money.
B:
You
use
it
to
buy
gifts
C:
You
give
it
to
the
poor.
D:
You
turn
it
in
to
the
police.
-
Dad,
this
is
really
stupid.
-
I'd
keep
the
money.
Edward?
Hey,
how
about
after
dinner
we
go
down
You're
not
seeing
Jim
tonight?
No.
We
had
the
coolest
show
and
tell
today.
This
kid
brought
in
a
box
of
baby
possums.
-
No
hair
at
all.
Thank
you,
dear.
Edward,
we're
waiting.
Give
it
to
my
loved
ones?
Oh,
Edward,
it
does
seem
that
You
dope,
everybody
knows
Good
thinking,
Kevin.
Well,
think
about
it,
you
guys.
I
mean,
that's
the
nicer
thing
to
do.
We're
not
trying
to
confuse
him,
we're
trying
I
am
being
serious,
Dad.
Forget
nice.
We're
talking
right
and
wrong.
-

Oh,
goodness!
No
wonder
poor
Edward
can't
Well,
did
you
hear
It's
unbelievable
they're
having
I
don't
think
so.
He
practically
raped
Joyce,
It's
a
miracle
she
escaped.
I
have
nothing
against
Bill
and
Peg,
but...
I
know.
They've
got
that
Those
poor
things!
Can
you
imagine?
What
did
you
say
about
the
Christmas
party?
I
said
I
hoped
we
could
make
it.
I
lied
too.
Edward?
Do
you
want
to
-
Again?
It
makes
me
proud
to
have
you
-
Hi,
honey.
-
Kevin,
want
to
play
scissors,
paper,
stone?
-
Why?
-
People's
feelings,
please.
A
few
manners!
Never
you
mind,
dear.

I

It's
just
what

need
to
calm
things
down,
Do
you
have
any
more
bells,
honey?

Hey!

Now
you've
done
it.
It's
just
a
scratch,
Jim,
really.
It's
OK.
-
Touch
her
again
and
I'll
kill

Call
a

He
skewered
Kim.
Stay
away
from
her.
I

it!
You
can't

anything
without
ruining

I

Hey,

where
are

goin'?
Where
is
he?
-
He
tried
to
hurt
you.
Are
you
nuts?
I
just
saw
him!
Jim,
I
don't
love
you
any
more.
Are
you
serious?
And
lose
you
to
that?
He
isn't
even
human.
Just
get
out
of
here,
OK?
Just
go!
Dad,
did
you
see
where
Edward
went?
I
don't
know.
He
just
waltzed
down
the
street.
-
We
have
to
find
him,
Mom.
Go
on
in
the
house.
I'll
take
care
of
it.
I'll
go
find
him.

Edward!
I'm
calling
the
police!

Of

See
all
that
blood,
sweetie?

Oh!
Hello.
I'm
here
to
see
the
man
with
the
hands.
Ohh!
-
Uh...
Oh,
dear.

Helen,
did
you
actually
see
him?
Yes!
Look!

I'm
looking
for
the
man
with
the
scissors.
-
Thank
God
you're
here.
All
right,
calm
down,
calm
down.
Just
go
home.

A...
a
demon.
A
demon.
I'm
sure
your
father'll
find
him
soon.
What
time
is
it?
It's
almost
8.30.
Great
party,
huh?
Mom,
where
are
they?
-
God,
I
hope
he's
OK.
You
know,
when
I
brought
Edward
...I
really
didn't
think
things
through.
And
I
didn't
think
about
Or
to
us.
Or
to
the
neighbourhood.
And
now
I
think
that
maybe...
...it
might
be
best
if
he
goes...
...back
up
there.
Because
at
least
there
he's
safe.
And
we'd
just...
go
back
to
normal.

I
got
halfway
to
the
Whitmans'.
Let's
get
in
the
car
and
go
look
for
him.
-
Where's
Kevin
now?
Oh,
for
God's
sakes!
-
Where
do
you
think
you're
goin'?
-
You
stay
here
in
case
somebody
shows
up.
Police!
Edward?
Are
you
OK?
Yes.
Are
you
OK?
Where
is
everybody?
Out
looking
for
you.
Hold
me.
I
can't.
I
know
it's
a
little
early
...I
have
a
present
for
you.

Forget
holding
her
hand.
Picture
the
damage
he
could
do
other
places.

Yeah.
That's
sick.
Ugh!
I
feel
like
I'm
gonna
pass
out
Later.
First,
take
me
to
her
house.
Come
on.
Don't
make
me
drive.
Just
do
it!
Jesus.
Maybe
she
was
right
about
you.
-
Just
drive!
-

See
you
tomorrow.
Call
me.
Have
they
caught
him
yet?
-
Who?
Let
me
know
when
they
do.
Let
us
all
know,
OK?
Like
a
good
boy.
Kevin.
-
Urgh!
-
It's
OK.

Ow!
Ow!
-
Edward,
stop!

Help
us!
What
are
you
doing?
Get
away
from
him!

Hey...
-
Let
go
of
me!
Kevin!

-
Get
away!


Run.
Kevin's
all
right!
He's
gone.
Let's
not
bother
him,
all
right?

Go
on,
run.
-
What
happened?
Is
he
dead?
It's
all
over.
Go
on
home.
What
happened
out
there?
It
is
all
over.

Where
is
he?
Where
is
he?

Get
back
here!
Look
at
that!
I
don't
believe
this.
They
don't
have
him.
I'm
goin'.
No!
That's
not
a
good
idea.
They're
coming?
Did
I
hurt
Kevin?
No,
he's
OK.
Mostly
he
was
just
scared.
Edward,
I
was
so
afraid.
I
thought
you
were
dead.
I
didn't.
No!
No!
Jim,
stop!
No!
No!
Stop
it.
Or
I'll
kill
you
myself.
Aagh!
Hey!
I
said
stay
away
from
her!


Goodbye.

I
love
you.


l-ls
he
in
there?
He's
dead.
The
roof
caved
in
on
him.
They
killed
each
other.
You
can
see
for
yourselves.
See?

I'm
goin'
home.
Joyce...
She
never
saw
him
again.
Not
after
that
night.
How
do
you
know?
Because
I
was
there.
You
could
have
gone
up
there.
No,
sweetheart.
I'm
an
old
woman
now.
I
would
rather
him
remember
me
How
do
you
know
he's
still
alive?
I...
don't
know.
Not
for
sure,
but...
I
believe
he
is.
You
see,
before
he
came
down
here...
...
it
never
snowed.
And
afterwards...
...it
did.
If
he
weren't
up
there
now,
Sometimes
you
can
still
catch
me
