I'm
playing
with
you.
Trust
me,
I'm

You
want
some?
So
I'm
parked
all
the
way
on
the
other
side.
I

So,
what
happened
with
your
girlfriend?
-
That

somebody
else?
Wanna
know
what
happened?
She
snooped
around
on
my
computer,
I
told
her
every
fucking
guy
watches
She
acted
like
I
was
cheating
on
So...
we
broke
up.
And
you
know
what?
-
Just
porn?
-
No,
I
don't
buy
it.
Was
it
just
once?
Oh.
OK.
So
she
caught
you
once,
which
is
why
'cause
you're
hiding
it
from
her,
I
don't
know.
Am
I
right?
Oh,
God,
you're
like
-
How
often
do
you
watch
it?
-
No,
like
every
day?
All
right.
When
was
the
last
-
I
don't
know.
-
Seriously,
I
have
no
idea.
No.
I
like
my
porn,
OK?
I
watch
it
every
day.
Maybe
when
I
was
a
kid,
like
before
I
but
even
then
-
Have
you
ever
thought
about
quitting?
-
You're
talking
about
it
like...
No,
why
would
I?
You're
a
good-looking
guy,
I'm
sure
Why
bother
with
porn
when
you
Nah,
see,
it's
not
I
mean,
real
pussy's
all
good,
No,
no,
no
offense
taken.
So
Well,
what
is
it?
that
you
don't
get
from
sex
-
I
lose
myself.
Yeah,
just...
goodbye.
-
And
that
doesn't
happen
when
you
have
sex.
Sure,
don't
we
all?
Um...
OK.
One
more
question,
-
You
ever
jerk
off
without
porn?
-

It's
porn,
I
knew
a
few
guys
in
high
school
who
That's
like
a
junkie.
They
couldn't
stop.
-
Hi.
-
Somebody's
excited.
-
I
wanted
to
talk
to
you.
Don't
you
wanna...?
Don't
you
wanna
wait
OK.
All
right.

You're...
You're
intense
today.
-
I
gotta
talk
to
you.
-
when
you
said
it.
Well,
I'm
flattered.
-

So
you
were
right.
-
About
what,
your
girlfriend?
I'm
sorry.
-
I
stopped
watching
porn.
-
I
don't
know
if
it
is.
I
wasn't
gonna
stop,
what
you
asked
me
before,
without
watching
porn,
-
Yeah?
And
you
couldn't?
I
don't
know
what's
wrong
with
me.
I've
been

Oh,
my
God!
You
haven't
cum
in
a
week?
OK,
wait.
No.
I
want
to
-
So
you
haven't
watched
porn
in
a
week.
-
That's
good.
Uh,
yeah,
but
that
movie
-
Did
you
ever
watch
it?
OK.
It's
totally
unlike
the
stuff
-
That
is
not
healthy.
Oh,
my
God,
please!
and
it's
nothing
to
do
with
actual
sex.
-
No,
I
get
off
fine
with
real
girls.
Yeah,
I
just
couldn't
get
off
But
didn't
you
tell
me
last
week
that
Well,
honey,
I'm
gonna
be
honest
with
you,
Look,
the
way
you
have
sex,
It's
like
I'm
not
even
there.
I
mean,
look,
it's
fine
with
me.
It
just
so
happens
that
meaningless
sex
but
you
said
that
you
If
you
wanna
lose
yourself,
you
have
And
she
has
to
lose
herself
You
know
what?
-
No,
it's
fine.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
I'm...
I
didn't
mean
-
You
didn't.
That's
fine.
You
know
what?
Let's
take
a
bath.
-
What?
Nah!
Come
on,
let's
take
a
bath.
I'm
gonna
get
you
a
towel.

Hey,
where
were
you?
I
used
one
of
the
towels
that
was
Yeah,
that's
fine.
-
What's
wrong?
-
You
don't
live
here
alone,
do
you?
There's
some
kind
of...
-
No.
I
don't
wanna
get
caught
out
and
now
some
No,
it's
nothing
like
that.
All
right.
So,
what
is
it?
Since
when
do
you
ask
me
Since
right
now.
-
It
really
doesn't
matter.
No,
it
doesn't.
Didn't
you
tell
me
it's
sort
of
fucked
My
husband
and
my
son

JON:
In
the

the
-
PRIEST:
Amen.
Bless
you,
my
son.
for
I
have
sinned.
It
has
been
one
-
PRIEST:
Tell
me
your
sins.
I
told
you
that,
uh...
Well,
actually,
Something
I've
always
kinda
wondered
is,
is
or
there's
a
few
of
you
and
you
switch
off,
or...
Well,
anyway,
I
told
the
Father
that
I
stopped
watching
pornography,
but
The
thing
is,
this
week
I
actually
did
stop,
So...
-
PRIEST:
Yes?
Other
than
that,
I
did
have
sex
but
it
was
different,
it
wasn't
I
don't
know,
it's
hard
to
explain,
but...
For
these
and
all
the
sins
PRIEST:

PRIEST:
Through

of
Wait!
Father,
I'm
really
sorry,
but
could
you
just
tell
me
how
you
'Cause
I...
I
really
thought
there
PRIEST:
Have
faith,
my
son.
Through

I
absolve
you
from
your

Barbara
and
I
split
up.
-
Can
you
get
her
back?
-
Did
you
try
to
call
her?
-
Look
what
you
did.
I
just
want
you
to
be
happy,
that's
all!
-
I
wasn't
happy.
Look
at
me!
but

Honey,
calm
down,

You
don't

Jon,
say
something!
Stop
upsetting
your
mother!
What
-
I
don't
know.
-
in
a
man's
life,
everybody
knows
that!
'Cause
I
sure
don't
want
a
family.
-
Well,
and
that's
all
she
wanted.

Sorry
about
that.

A
little

So...
I'm
good.
How
are
you?
-
Everybody
good?

Thanks
for
meeting
me.
Hope
you
understand
why
I
thought
That's
fine.
No,
actually
I
gotta
-

You
changed
your
hair?
-
So?
I
just
wanted
to
apologize.
I
lied
to
you,
Well,
that's
I
don't
really
know
what
I
do
I
forgive
you,
or
we're
supposed
-
No.
No,
I
just
wanted
to
tell
you...
of
a
relationship,
Jon.
-
You're
not.
'Cause
you're
a
selfish
-
Yeah,
I
was.
I'm
sorry.
Yeah.
I
was
thinking
about
Well,
I
said
it
because
-
It's
not
true.
You
didn't
only
ask
me
for
one
thing.
a
lot
of
different
things
...I
couldn't
do
it
Well,
when
a
real
man
he
doesn't
mind
He'll
do
anything
for
her.
Yeah,
but
don't
you
think
that
No,
I
don't.
But
that's
why
you
like
to
watch
because
you
don't
gotta
Yeah,
that's
one-sided
Look,
sweetie,
Don't
call
me
anymore.
The
streak
is
over,
-
I'd
rather
get
pizza
with
my
boys.
Every
fucking
time
we
go
out,
But
not
tonight,
The
fans
are
devastated.
Yeah!
Well,
I
thought
it
was
on
-
No,
that
girl
was
annoying.
-
Eight.
Her
body
was
at
least
an
eight,
-
Who
cares
how
she
talks?
that's
why
I
didn't
smash.
What
about
you?
-
How
did
it
go?
-
I
got
a
number.
-
You
like
that?
-
Easy,
easy.
Did
you
get
her
name?
Wait...
-
Oh,
fuck!
I
saved
it
as
pony-tail.
-

Danny-boy!
All
right,
all
right,
all
right.
JON:
This
fucking
lady.
I
don't
usually
like
it
when
a
and
this
girl
does
that
a
lot.
But
I
don't
know
what
it
is
When
she
does
it,
I
don't
mind.
I
just
look
right
back
at
her,
...I'm
hard
as
a
fucking
rock.
It's
like
she
knows
Or
I
know
what
I
don't
know,
it's
that
two-way
And
I
don't
mean
love
like,
"I
I'm
definitely
not
thinking
And
she's
not
either.
She
can't.
I
guess
I
just
mean
love
like,
you
know,
like
And
while
we're
doing
it,
all
and
it's
just
me
and
her,
and
yeah,
I
do
lose
and
I
can
tell
she
and
we're
just
fucking...
