for
this

This
girl
is
gay.
Any
interest
-
An
animated
series
?
-
Well,
that's
great,
isn't
it
?
-
But
you
don't.
I
don't
know
if
that's
the
perception
I
know
this
sounds
pretentious
I'd
like
to
think
of
us
I'd
like
to
get
back
to
doing
something
Well,
when
are
you
When
we
have
something
I
weirder
you
out
Uh,
no,
not
really.
-
Oh,
come
on
!
I'd
never
seen
that
kind
of
thing
It
just
took
a
while
You
wanna
talk
about
it
?
If
you
want
to.
I
like
you,
Holden.
I
haven't
liked
a
man
And
it's
not
because
I'm
a
man-hater
It's
just
been
some
time
since
I've
immediately

into
And
I
want
you
to
feel

I'd
really
like
us
So
if
there's
anything
you
-
Okay.
Okay.
Why
girls
?
-
Why
men
?
If
that's
the
only
reason
No,
it's
more
than
that.
So
you've
never
been
Curious
?
Well,
I
always
wondered
-

You
know
what
I
mean.
-
Why
not
?
-
Because
?
Well,
that's
how
I
feel.
You
know,
-
Well,
so,

?
But
you've
only
So
you're
saying
until
they've
had
intercourse
Isn't
that
Again
with
your
standards.
I
think
virginity
is
lost
-
With
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex.
Because
that's
the
standard.
So
if
a
virgin
is
raped,
-
No,
of
course
not.
So
she's
had
sex,
but
not
Hence,
according
to
your
definition,
-
Okay,
fine,
I'll

I
love
you
and

Although,
I
think
And
not
in
a
misplaced
Although,
I'm
sure
I
love
you.
Very--
Very
simple.
You
are
the
epitome
of
everything
I
have
And
I
know
that
you
think
of
me
and
crossing
that
line
is
the
furthest
you
would
ever
consider,
but--

I
just--
I
can't
stand
next
to
you
I
can't--
I
can't
look
into

I

that
some

if
there's
a

And
all
I
ask,
please,
you

that

can't

that

right.
-
Fuck
you
!
Oh,
it's
not
possible
Cohee
I
can
vouch
for
is
clean.
But
Derris
?
Name
me
one
chick
in
our
senior
class
Let
it
go,
okay
?
I'm
telling
you,
much
less
these
two
And
the
bitch
could
be
a
bigger
germ
Would
you
let
it
go,
okay
?
She's
my
goddamn
girlfriend
!
And
I
swear
to
God,
if
I
ever
hear
you
Alyssa
looks
a
little
peaked,
I'll
put
Maybe
I'll
put
your
fuckin'
Yeah,
maybe.

I've
been
workin'
out,
You
better
be
ready
So,
where's
that
bitch
partner
Sulking.
He's
having
a
real
problem
I
think
it's
more
like
Banky's
having
a
and
I'm
just
another
paradigm
-
Banky
does
not
hate
gays.
This
latest
episode
between
you
I
n
his
warped
perception,
he
lost
you
You
make
it
sound
like
Don't
kid
yourself.
That
boy
loves
you
in
a
way

-
He's
been
digging
up
dirt
on
Alyssa.
And
just
what
has
Mr.
Angela
Lansbury

He
heard
some
bullshit
Really
?
Then
he's
barkin'
up
the
wrong
tree
He's
not
gonna
make
you
see
by
pointing
out
-
This
one
?
-
Actually,
it
has
kinda
gotten
to
me.
Well,
Banky's
got
-
He's
not
known
for
misinformation.
-
Would
that
bother
you
?
-

Ah
!
Ooh
!
Thanks
for
being
so
comforting.
So,
what
do
you
care
?
That's
just
it,
you
know
?
-
But
it
just--
It
gets
to
me.
the
kind
of
gal
Alyssa
is,
you
don't
of
an
all-girl
group
grope
?
You
see,
that
doesn't
bother
me,
right
?
Oh,
Holden,
I
beg
you,
please.
Don't
by
falling
prey
-
Which
is
?
It's
oh-so
acceptable
to
be
a
gay
girl
Got
this
fool
picture
of
lipstick
Like
they
all
resemble
Alyssa,
Do
I
detect
a
little
Gay
or
straight,
-
And
most
of
those
boys
are
scary.
I
thought
you
fags
were
all
Screw
that
all-for-one
shit.
I
gotta
deal
with
bein'
a
minority
and
nobody's
supportin'
While
the
whole
of
society's
here
I
sit,
a
reviled
gay
man.
And
to
top
that
off,
notoriously,
the
most
-
Three
strikes--
-Are
you
HooperX?
-
Salaam
alaykem,
little
brother.
Hey.
You
see
He
the
devil.
Never
take
your
eye
-
Fight
the
power,
little
G.
Word
is
bond.
Look
at
what
I
have
to
resort
to
Look
at
what
I
have
to
resort
to
What
is
it
about
gay
men

-As
for
this
hang-up
with
Alyssa's
past,
maybe
what's
troubling
you
is
that
-
What
does
that
mean
?
Like
you
don't
know
Men
need
to
believe
that
they're
Like
they're
the
only
ones
And
it's
hard
-
I
let
my
boys
run
with
it
for
a
while.
Feed
'em
some
of
that
"
I've
never
and
let
them
labor
under
the
delusion
until
I
can't
stand
'em
no
more,
It's
a
sick
game.
The
world
would
be
if
people
would
just
accept
and
anything
you
can
do
has
probably
been
done
-
Hey,
I
can
accept
that.
Do
yourself
a
favor:
Just
ask
the
girl
Get
it
out
of
the
way
before
it
gets
Ooh
!
Yanni
!

Since
most
of
these
people
I'm
going
to
cheer
I'm
a
big
visitors
fan.
Especially
the
kind
that
make
coffee
That
was
a
joke.
A
little
wacky
wordplay.
Wha-What
do
you
mean,
Was
I
being
The
kind
that,
until
recently,
So,
uh,
that
was
Uh,
yeah.
Hey

Foul
!
Foul
!
So,
nobody
but
me
has
spent
the
night
Somethin'
on
your
mind,
-Just
wondering.
I
was
just
asking.
Oh,
sweetie.
I
only
have
eyes
for
you.
If
you
don't
start
usin'
that
whistle,
Right
?
What's
uh--
"
Finger
Cuffs"
?
I
n
your
senior
year
book
your
nickname

It
was
?
Shit.
I'd
look
it
up,
but
I
threw

Where'd
you
see
a
North
yearbook
?
-
Rick
Derris
?

Sure.
We
used
to
Punch
him
in
the
fuckin'
neck,
Come

Did
you
guys,
like,
Date
Rick
Derris
?
Just-Just
you
and
Rick.
No.
Me,
Rick
and,
um--
God,
what
was
his
name
?
Um--
What
was
his
name
?
-
What
was
his
name
?
-
Yes

Cohee

Cohee
Lundin

God,
I
haven't
thought
Those
guys
used
to
come
over
to
my
house
They'd
bug
my
sisters,
look
through
raid
the
fridge.
They
really
took
advantage
This
one
day,
Rick
pulled
his
dick
out
and
started
Right
in
front
of
Cohee,
man.
Rick
pulled
his
dick
out
?
-


I
blew
him
[Pulse
Stops,
-
Excuse
me
?
That's
what
this
little
Well,
next
time
try
not
to
There's
subtler
ways
Geez,
man.
Even
I
knew
If
you
wanted
background
information
I
would
have
gladly
You
didn't
have
to
go
playing
Told
ya
these
were
Hey.
Hey
!
-
Hey,
would
you
wait
a
minute
?
-
So
it's
true,
right
?
Yeah,
Holden,
it's
true.
I
n
fact,
everything
you
heard
Yeah,
I
took
on

You
wanna
hear
some
gems
I
took
a
26-year-old
guy
and
left
to
have
sex
with
him
How
about
in
college
when
I
let
Shannon
only
to
find
out
he
broadcast
it
They
're
all
true.
Didn't
you
know
?
Did
you
somehow
fuckin'
fail
What
the
fuck's
wrong
with
you
?
Easily
!
Some
I
did
out
of
stupidity,
some
But
good
or
bad,
and
I
am
not
making
Not
to
you,
And
how
dare
you
lay
a
guilt
trip
on
me
Who
the
fuck
do
you
think
How
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
How
are
you
supposed
to
Feel
whatever
the
fuck
you
want
The
only
thing
that
matters
-
I
don't
know
how
I
feel
about
you
now.
-
Because
I
had
some
sex
?
Yes,
Holden.
Most
of
it
Like
you
never
had
sex
There
is
a
world
of
fucking
difference
and
getting
fucked
by
two
fuckin'
guys
-
They
fuckin'
used
you.
You
don't
think
I
would
have
let
it
I
was
an
experimental
girl,
Maybe
you
knew
early
on
but,
unlike
you,
I
was
not
given
So
I
tried
it
all.
That
is
until
we--
And
suddenly
I
was
sated.
Can't
you
take

You
turned
out
to
be
the
missing
piece

Look,
I'm
sorry
I
let
you
believe
you
I
should
have
been
But
it
just
didn't--
It
seemed
that
me
telling
you
over
and
over
how
Holden,
I'm
sorry.
Just
don't
do
that.
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me

some
sort
of
half-assed,

pubescent
antics

took
place
What

fuck
I
want
us
to
be
something
And
what's
that
?
A
normal
couple.
So

And

pretend
you
need
me
You
don't
have
to
lie
Even
though
And
I
don't
need

me
Stay,

Then

I

-
So

You

Maybe
'cause
I
got
this
tubby
bitch

my

time.
You

it.
When

Big

Stuffin'
two
guys,
You

I
heard
Eat
your
fuckin'
bagel
already
Look
at
this
touchy
So
if
you're
all
in
love
and
shit,
The
problem
is
It
was
bad
enough
when
it
was
You
throw
guys
into
the
mix--
All
that
experience,
you
know
?
Think
"good,"
ya
fuckin'
ninny
shithead,
Bitch
tasted
life.
Now
she's
settlin'
Settling
for
my
boring
ass.
-
That's
what
I'm
here
for.
It's
like
I
can't
get
these
visuals
out
And
I
don't
know
why
I
can't
let
-
I
look
at
her,
I
see
kids,
grandkids--
Yeah,
well,
I'm
scarin'
myself
that
I
can't
get
stupid
shit

I
don't
know.
Chasin'
Amy.
What
?

-
You're
chasing
Amy.
Fatbastard
does
this
all
the
time.
He
it'll
have
some
huge
impact
Jesus
Christ,
Always
yap-yap-yapping
all
the
time.
I
went
through
somethin'
like
what
-
This
chick
named
Amy.
A
couple
of
years
ago.
What,
she
live
in
Canada
or
something
?
Bitch,
what
you
don't
I
could
just
about
squeeze
Did
you
know
I
always
wanted
to
be
Bet
you
didn't
even
know
Just
tell
your
fuckin'
story
so
So
there's
me
and
Amy.
And
we're
Then
four
months
down
the
road
and
I
ask
about
the
ex-boyfriend
which,
But
you
know
how
it
is:
You
don't
want
Stupid
guy
bullshit.
So,
anyway,
she
starts
They
fell
in
love,
went
out
for
Her
mother
likes
me
better,
But
then
she
drops
the
bomb
on
me,
It
seems
that
a
couple
of
times,
he
brought
some
people
Menage
a
trois,
Now
this
just
blows
my
mind,
right
?
-I
was
raised
Catholic,
for
God's
sakes.
Do
somethin'.
So
I'm
totally
weirded
out
by
this,
I
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
what
I'm
if
call
her
"slut,"
right,
I'm
out
for
blood.
"What
the
fuck
is
your
problem
?"
"
It
was
that
time,
that
place,"
and
she
because
she
doesn't
feel
I'm
like,
"Oh,
really
?"
I
look
her
in
Fuckin'
A.
No,
idiot.
I
wasn't
disgusted
with
her,
You
know,
at
that
moment
I
felt
small,
Like
I'd
never
be
on
her
level,
never
be
But
what
I
did
not
get,
She
wasn't
lookin'
for
that
guy
anymore,
But
by
the
time
I
figured
this
all
All
had
to
show
for
it
was
foolish
She
was
the
girl.
But...
I
pushed
her
away.
So
I've
spent
every
day
So
to
speak.
Enough
of
this
fuckin'
melodrama.
There's
one
bitch
in
the
world,
Get
up,
tons
of
fun.
-
Catch
in'
a
bus
to
Chi-town.
Business,
yo.
How
many
more
of
those
Uh,
I
don't
know.
I
don't
know
how
much
longer
Yeah,
good.
There's
a
million
people
who'd
love
But
that
ain't
like
us
at
all,
runnin'
around
like
Sayin'--
What's
that
shit
Oh,
um...
"Snootchie-bootchies."
Who
the
fuck
It's
a
big
world,
G.
-
Till
then,
keep
your
unit
on
ya.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Knock
that
shit
off!
Jedi
bitch.
Man,
what
do
you
always
have
-
Man,
shut
up.
Okay.
You
guys
are
probably
wondering
knowing
that
we
have
shit
I
just
figured
you
wanted
You
know,
by
telling
her
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
-
Fuck
you.
Okay,
enough.
Enough.
Now,
I've
been
going
over
and
and
I've
dissected
it
Banky,
there's
tension
between
you
and
I
You
hate
me
dating
Alyssa
and
you
want
How
perceptive.
Alyssa,
you
and
I
have
hit
a
wall...
'cause
I
don't
know
how
to
deal
That's
a
nice
way
I'd
have
said
I'm
only
gonna
Now,
I
know
I'm
to
blame
one
way
Alyssa,
with
you
because
you've
had
such
a
big
life
and
my
life's
been
-
That
doesn't
matter
to
me.
I
have
to
get
Banky,
I
know
why
you're
having
such
It's
something
that's
been
I
guess
I
just
didn't
You're
in
love
with
me.
What
?
You're
attracted
to
me.
Just
as,
in
It
makes
sense.
We've
been
together
Well,
I
gotta
get
goin'.
I
gotta
catch
the
last
few
minutes
It's
somethin'
you're
And
that
would
explain
your
homophobia,
Jesus,
just
'cause
a
guy's
Bank.
Stop.
Deal
with
it.

Now,
you
guys
are
probably
that
I've
been
going
over
and
over
What
does
one
have
Don't.
And
when
I
did
some
it
came
to
me
And
it
all
made
sense.
I
know
what
we
have
to
do.
And
then
you,
Banky,
all
of
us--
Please
don't
say
it.
We've
all
gotta
I
mean,
look,
That
would
take
care
Alyssa,
with
you,
I
won't
feel
because
I'll
have
done
something
And
it
will
be
with
you,
which
will
Banky,
you
can
take
that
leap...
that
everyone
else
but
you
And
it'll
be
with
me,
We've
been
everything
to
each
other
and
now
we'll
have
been
And
it
won't
be
a
total
leap
for
you
And
when
it's
over,
all
that
hostility
because
you'll
have
shared
in
something
It'll
be
cathartic.
This
will
keep
us
together.

What
do
ya
say
?

Sure.
You
know
I
need
this.
You
know
it'll
help.
No.

Sorry.
No
?
I
thought
You
did
?
Sweetheart,
you've
done
stuff
This
should
be
You
don't
want
this.
No,
I
do
want
this.
This
has
I
mean,
how
can
you
not
?
No
?
You
can
take
it
from
two
guys
but
I
ask
you
to
share
an
experience
-
I
can't.
I'll
be
there.
And
when
it's
over
we'll
'cause
we'll
have
been
Then
we'll
be
on
the
same
level
and

That
time
is
over
for
me.
I've
been
there
and
I
didn't
find
I
found
that
it
you.
Doing
this
won't
help
you
forget
-
It'll
create
more.
Yes,
it
will
!

Maybe
you'll
see
me
Maybe
you'll
despise
me
for
going
along
Maybe
I'll
moan
differently,
and
then
you'll
resent
Banky
Or
you'll
alienate
him
You'll
grow
to
blame
and
hate
