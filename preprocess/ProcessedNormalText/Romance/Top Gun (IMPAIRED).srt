I
want
somebody's
butt!
I've
had
it!
God
damn
it!
That's
twice!
I
want
some
butts!
Well,
that'll
just
about
cover
Follow
me.
Gentlemen...
you
had
a
hell
of
a
first
day.
The
hard-deck
for
this
hop
You
knew
it,
you
broke
it.
You
followed
after
he
lost
sight
of
you
Why?
Sir!
I
had
Commander
Heatherly
He
saw
me
move
in
for
the
kill.
He
then
proceeded
We
weren't
below
10,000
I
had
the
shot....
there
was
no
danger,
You
took
it...
and
broke
a
major
rule
Then
you
broke
another
one
Lieutenant
Mitchell...
Top
Gun
rules
exist
for
your
They
are
not
flexible,
Either
obey
them,
Is
that
clear?
Yes,
sir!
Dismissed.
I
really
enjoyed
that,
Mav.
Holy
shit!
Ahh.
Maybe
I
could
learn
You
have
the
number
Truck
Master,
I
think
it
is.
I
might
need
that.
His
fitness
report
says
it
all.

He
got
you,
didn't
he?
Yeah.
Maverick.
I
flew
with

Tell
me
one
thing.
If
you
had
to
go
into
battle,
JESTER:
I
don't
know.
I
just
don't
know.
Still
awake?
Yeah.
What's
up?
Can't
sleep.
When
I
first
realized
all
I
could
think
about
I
gotta
be
Right
now,
I've
got
a
family
I
can't
afford
to
blow
this.
I
guess
that
flyby
Look,
man,
They
wouldn't
let
you
'cause
you're
You
have
to
live
But
it's
like
every
time
it's
like
you're
flying
Makes
me
nervous.
You're
the
only
family
I've
got.
I'm
not
going
to
let
you
down,
Get
out
of
here.
A
rolling
reversal
would
work
If
I
reversed
on
a
hard
cross...
I
could
immediately
At
that
speed,
it's
too
fast.
It's
a
little
bit
Too
aggressive?
Yeah,
I
guess
I
go
right
after
it.
You
didn't
tell
me
You
didn't
give
me
a
chance,
You
deserved
it.
I
know.
But,
uh,
you
were
tempted...
to
ask
me
out
for
dinner.
-No.
No.
I
don't
date
students.
I
can
see
but
if
the

maybe
you
could.
It
