The
dream
is
always
the

JOEL:
Instead
of
going
home,
I
ring,
but
nobody
answers.
The
door
is
open,
so
I
go
inside.
I'm
looking
around
for
the
people,
And
then
...so
I
go
upstairs

JOEL:
This...
girl.
This
incredible
girl.
I
mean,
what
she's
doing
there
...because
she
doesn't
live
there...
...but
it's
a
dream,
so
I
go
with
it.
''Who's
there?''
she
says.
''Joel,''
I
say.
''What
are
you
doing
here?''
''I
don't
know
what
I'm
doing
here.
What
are
you
doing
here?''
''I'm
taking
a
shower,''
she
says.
Then
I
give
her:
''You
want
me
to
go?''
''No,''
she
says.
''I
want
you
to
wash
my
back.''
So
now
I'm
getting
enthusiastic
So
I
go
to
her,
but
she's
hard
to
find
I
keep
losing
her.
Finally,
I
get
to
the
door...
...and
I
find
myself
in
a
room
I'm
over
three
hours
late.
I've
got
two
minutes
I've
just
made
a
terrible
mistake.
I'll
never
get
to

is
ruined.

were
drying
upstairs.
-That's
possible.
So
she
plops
down
...under

...she
looks
up
at
me
and
she
says:
"I
think
I'm
in

-She
said
that?
-I'm
telling
you.
I
didn't
have
to

anything.
What
did
you
do?
What

I
did?
I
think
you
got

out

there,

-Right.
Did
you
have
your
bike
there?
Yeah.
I
think
you
jumped
on
your
bike,

-That's
what
you
guys
think,
right?

home?

Kessler
sitting
there
Yup.

MILES:
Yeah.
Only
when
it
came
down
to
it,
That
should
never
stop
you.
She
seemed
too
big.
It
could've
worked
out.
I
figured
I'd
have
gotten
into

brings

are
you
doing?
Yeah,
I
can
see
that.
So,
uh...
...you're
home
now.
Yeah,
I
live
here,
remember?
-Yeah,
take
it
easy,
man.

Tell
me
you
didn't
Who,
Lana?
-Yeah,
Lana.
Nothing.
I
met
her.
She's
nice.
You're
sure
you
didn't
Yeah,
I
swear.
You
did
it
with
her,
I
did
not
do
it
with
her,
Joel.
Okay.

Ask
me
about
Vicki.
Ha-ha-ha!
JOEL:
Who's
Vicki?
You
Joel?
Nice
place
you
got
here.
-Where's
Lana?
VICKI:
Get
out.
I'm
not
kidding.
What's
your
problem?
Just
leave.
Please.
Look,
we're
not
exactly
-Look...
-What
is
this
for?
You're
the
house.
I
am
not
the
house,
okay?
Just
leave.
I
mean
it.
He's
mad,
Vicki.
Already?
I
just
got
here.
I
think
he
wants
us
to
go.
Do
you
want
us
to
go?

Thank
you.

You
know
what
-You
know
how
you
humil...
-Come
on.
LANA:
I
don't
wanna
do
nothing
GUIDO:
Hey,
get
in
the
car.
Cut
it
out.

Lana!
Get...

Excuse
me.
What
can
I
do
for
you?
Who
are
you?
Joel.
Are
you
the
kid
I
chased
last
night?
Is
there
something
You
know,
People
get
hurt
all
the
time.
Are
you
a
smart
kid?
Huh?
I
mean,
you
look
like
a
smart
kid.
-I'm
okay.
JOEL:
I'm
afraid
I'm
gonna
have
to
Joel...
...the
door
is
locked.
You're
starting
to
give
me
LANA:
You
gonna
open
the
door
or
what?
LANA:
Guido,
go
home.
GUIDO:
Look,
shut
your
mouth.
Listen,
maybe
we
don't
GUIDO:
Oh,
yeah?
Okay,
fine.
GUIDO:
-Who?
If
you
don't
work
for
me?
Maybe
we
work
for
Joel
now.
Heh.
She's
only
kidding.
I
hope
so.
Heh.
Look,
Joel,
...so
I'm
gonna
tell
you
something
Now,
you're
having
fun
now,
right?
Right,
Joel?
The
time
of
your
life.
In
a
sluggish
economy,
never,
ever
Now,
if
you're
smart,
...you're
not
gonna
make
me

Thank
you,
Joel.
Very
decent
of
you.
Just
as
long
One
night,
all
right?
We
get
in
touch
with
Tandy,
-Did
you
try
her
again?
JOEL:
If
I
can
get
my
stuff
back,
-Then
you'll
leave?
VICKI:
I
don't
know,
Lana.
Clean,
polite,
quick.
I
think
there's
a
real
future
here.

"HUNGRY

-Hi.
What
are
you
studying?

It's
a
workshop...
...on

See,
we
make
a
product
Do
you
make
a
lot
of
money?
No.
Not
really.
No?
No,
but
we,
uh...
...get
to
compete
Actually,
it's
fucked.
Ha.
I...
I'm
just
kidding.
It's
really,
uh,
quite
competitive.
You
ever
get
high,
Joel?
Yeah.
All
the
time.
Because,
see,
me
and
Vicki
Maybe
going
out
and
getting
some
You
wanna
come?

Yeah.
Ha.
I
could
go
for
some
ice
cream
BARRY:
No.
I
do
not
believe
so.
I
think
you're
really
wasted.
This
is
not
wasted,
Barry.
This
is
definitely
not
wasted.

BARRY:
-I'm
a
little
wasted.
-Don't
let
me
do
anything
stupid.
BARRY:
How
do
you
like
living
at
home?
It's
okay.
I'll
be
out
next
year.
I'll
bet
your
folks
are
nice.
And
they're
gone
till
Sunday?
Yeah.
Because,
you
know,
I
was
thinking...
I
mean,
after
your
friend
came
over,
A
kid
our
age
walks
in
Glenn.
Ha.
Where
did
he
get
that
kind
of
change?
I
don't
know.
He
said
he
cashed
a
bond.
You
people
have
a
lot
of
bonds.
So
I
was
thinking...
...if
we
ever
got
our
friends
together,
Yeah.
You're
right.
You
wanna
do
that?
-What?
...next
couple
of
days.
No.
I
don't
think
so.
Make
some
money.

you

be.
What
if
I
said
I'd
be

Hey,
I'm
not
pushing
you
on
the
idea
It's
just
that
my
mind
keeps
working
Nothing
I
can
do
about
it.
Warm
enough?
I'm
okay.
How
come
you
left
home?
Why?
I
was
just
wondering.
I
left
home
because
my

else
do
you
wanna
know?
You
have
any
brothers
and

I've
got
a

What
else?
Look,
if
you
don't
wanna
talk...
-No.
Ask
me
anything.
No,
I
wanna

What
does
he
do?
He's
in

Yeah?
How
come
you're
not
in

I'm
not
my

Look,
I'm
really...
I'm
really
trying
...but
I'd
appreciate
it
if
you'd
stop
...while
you're
leaning
I'll
see
you
around.
Hello.
Was
it
something
I
said?
Uh...
Oh,

Please,

You

I'll
tell
you
"Unexcused."
See,

...If
you
write
"unexcused,"
It'll

Look,
if
you'd
just
stop
and
listen
to
me,
...I'll
explain
everything.
Thank
you.
You
see,
uh...
...the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
A
call
girl,
actually.
Look,
you're
writing
again.
This
is
not
"unexcused."
If
you
just
let
me
explain,
...then
you'll
understand,
Nurse
Bolik.
Why?
Why
won't
you
listen
to
me?
I
had
a
doctor's
appointment.
Excuse
me.
It
just
wasn't
the
girl,
I
put
my
father's
car
...I
had
to
get
it
fixed.
Look,
just
give
me
a
break.
Let
me
put
it
this
way:
I
have
spent
the
last
four
years
...busting
my
butt
in
this

hole.
I...
I'm
sorry.
I
just
don't
think
I
can

five
days.

him

They
trashed
his
whole

What's
he
gonna
do
about
the
car?
-You
okay,

I'm
okay.

I
need
a
bike.
He
needs
a
bike.
-Glenn,
can
I
borrow
your
bike?
-Come
on,
Glenn.
LANA:
Okay,
what
do
we
got?
Totals.
Look
it.
You
got...
Hold
on.
JOEL:
It
was
great
-No
guilt,
no
doubts,
no
fear.
-None
of
my
specialties.
Just
this
shameless
pursuit
What
a
capitalist.
She
told
me
I
could
make
more
money
Enough
to
pay
for
my
father's

She
told
me
she'd
be
my
girlfriend.
She
told
me
a
lot
of
things.
I
believed
them
all.
So
she
introduced
me
to
her
friends.

-Boss.
...would
you
just
have
a
seat
in
the...?

We
made
Barry
our
treasurer.

JOEL:
I
concentrated
on
sales.
JOEL:
All
right.
What
did
that
cost
you?
-About
30.
Okay,
maybe
35.

Any
movies?

-Twenty
dollars.
-Parking?
JOEL:
Maybe
$6.
All
right,

uh...
...what
happened?
She
slept
with
Jacobsen.

That's
all
I'm
saying.
You
know
what
he
said
afterwards?
No.
He
said
the

had
knowledge.
And
he
was
glad
You
know
why?
Why?
Because

think
about
it.

gonna
break
it.

put

the
Chinese
things
together,

don't
think
you
should
mix

-Joel?

You're
home.

-Well,
I
was
here.
Oh,
you're
kidding.
Gee,
I
didn't
think
you
were
coming
home

I
said
the
5th.
No,
uh,
you
said
the
6th.

sure
I
said
the
5th.

me
a

with

I
talk
to

minute?

happened

do
you
mean?

a
crack
in
it.

kidding.

not
kidding.
There
is
a
crack
in
the
egg.
-What's
wrong?
FATHER:
-I
don't
know.
Mom,
maybe
it
was
there
before.
I
don't
think
so,

How
could
you
let
this
happen?
I'm
sorry.
This
is
so
damned

We'll
get
another
one.

I'll
pay
for
it.

will
you
get
the
money

sorry,

be

right.

...do
you
have
something
to
tell
me?
No...
...I
don't
think
so.
I
just
got
off
the
telephone
Apparently,
uh,
"Princeton
can
use
a
guy
like

What?
"Princeton
can
use
a
guy
like
Joel."
His
exact
words.
That's
unbelievable.
You're
as
good
as
in.
I
knew
you
could
do
it.
Haven't
I
been
telling
you,
...and
take
some
chances?

were
so
right.
You've
made
me
very
proud.

we
might
be

know
what
I
think?
I
think
we're
both
gonna
make
it
big.

am
very
optimistic.
