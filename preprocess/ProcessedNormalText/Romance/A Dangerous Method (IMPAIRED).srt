[MEN
SPEAKING

Good
morning.
I'm
Dr.
Jung.
I
admitted
you
yesterday.
I'm...
I'm
not...
Let
me
explain
I
propose
that
we
meet
here,
to
talk
for
an
hour
or
two.
Talk?
Yes,
just
talk.
See
if
we
can
identify
So
as
to
distract
you
I'm
gonna
sit
there,
I'm
gonna
ask
you
to
try
not
under
any
circumstances.
Now...
Have
you
any
idea
what
may
have
brought
on

Hum...
Humiliation.

Any...
Any
kind
of...
Of
humiliation.
I
can't
bear
to
see
it
and
I...
I
start
pouring
with
sweat,
My...
My...
My...
My...
My
father
lost
his
temper
all
the
time.
He
was
always
angry
with...
When
you
stopped
talking
did
a
thought
come
into
your
head?
I
don't
know.
Or
an
image,
perhaps.
Was
it
an
image?
Yes.
Yes.
What
was
the
image?
It
was...
It
was
a
hand.
My...
My...
My...
My
father's
hand.
Why
do
you
think
you
saw
that?
When...
Whenever
he
would...
After...
Whenever
he...
Whenever
he
hit
us,
afterwards
we
had
to...
We
had
to
kiss
his
hand.
What's
odd
is,
that
case
I
happened
to
pick
And
here
she
is,
Quite
a
coincidence.
As
you
know,
I
don't
believe
Spielrein's
not
No,
Jewish.
Father
is
a
very
successful
And
she's
exceptionally
Speaks
fluent
German.
Aspires
to
be
a
doctor
herself,
Perhaps
she's
the
one.
What
one?
For
your
experimental
treatment,
You're
so
astute.
I've
already
begun
it
with
her.
He's
kicking.
Can
you
feel?
Oh,
yes.
There
he
is.
What
I
don't
understand
having
proposed
this
this
talking
cure,
then
lets
years
go
by
without
giving
What's
he
playing
at?
Presumably
he
uses
No
idea.
So
might
you
be
It's
possible.
Why
don't
you
write
I
don't
know
him.
As
it
happens,
Spielrein's
mother
wanted
Another
coincidence.
My
father
thinks
my
mother
And
he's
right,
she
doesn't.
How
do
you
know?
My
angel
told
me.
What
angel?
An...
An
inner
voice.
He
used
to
tell
me
For
some
reason,
JUNG:
Angels
always
speak
German.
He
gave
me
the
power
to
know
what
people
are
Useful
ability
for
a
doctor.
You
hope
to
be
a
doctor
I'll
never
be
a
doctor.
I
have
to
go
away
for
a
while.
I'm
sorry.
Military
service.
We
all
have
to
do
it.
Just
for
a
couple
weeks.
I
can't
tell
you
what
You're
just
making
me
angry.
Even
if
I
could
tell
you,
Anyway,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
me.
Stop
it!
What?
I
was
only
trying
to...
I'm
sorry.

Can
we
get
back
now?
I
need
to
get
back.
It's
a
complete
waste
of
my
time.
Writing
prescriptions
and
examining
cocks
Is
that
what
you
do?
It's
not
good
for
me.
It's
not
good
for
my
patients.

You're
playing
with
your
food.
I'm
not
hungry.
NURSE:
I
shall
have
to
tell

Do
what
you
like.


ORDERLY:
Please,
miss.
Please.
You'll
catch
your
death.
Miss
Spielrein?
The
Herr
Direktor.
I
feel
you
may
have
a
little
I'm
a
believer
in
getting
our
patients
What
are
your
Suicide.
Interplanetary
travel.
When
Dr.
Jung
returns,
I
shall
ask
him
to
discuss
all
this
You
keep
him
away
from
me.


NURSE:
Now,
come
along.
Please.
Lie
still.

JUNG:
I'm
back.
How
have
you
been?
I've
been
talking
to
the
Herr
Direktor
I
told
him
you're
interested
He
suggested
you
might
like
to
assist
We're
quite
short-staffed,

No.

Thank
you.
Is
that
all?
How
did
I
do?

Goodbye.
Yes,
goodbye.
Any
preliminary
observations?
Obviously,
what's
uppermost
Good.
And
she's
a
little...
What's
the
word?
Why
don't
we
try
a
useful
word
"Ambivalent."
Yes.
About
the
baby.
Anything
else?
her
husband
might
be
What
makes
you
think
that?
Long
reaction
times
to
the
words
I
see.
When
you
said
"cap,"
Might
that
be
a
reference
You
have
quite
a
flair
Can
I
ask
you
something?
Of
course.
Is
she
your
wife?

I'm
sorry.
Sorry?
I
promised
you
a
son
and
here
she
is
a
day
late
Don't
be
absurd.
"A"
for
Agathe.
Next
time,
I'll
give
you
a
boy.
Can
you
explain
why
your
I'm
afraid.
There's
something
in
the
room.
Like
a
cat,
only
it
can
speak.
It
gets
into
bed
with
me.
Last...
Last
night,
it
suddenly
I
couldn't
hear
what.
But
then...

I
felt
it
against
my
back.
Something
slimy
like...
Like...

Like
some
kind
of
a
mollusk,
moving
against
my
back.
But
when
I...
When
I
turned
around,
You
felt
it
against
your
back?
Yes.
Were
you
naked?
I
was.
Were
you
masturbating?
Yes.
JUNG:
Tell
me
about
the
being
beaten
by
your
father.
SABINA:
I
was
about
4.
I
had
broken
a
plate
or...
Oh,
yes.
And
he
told
me...
to
go
into
the
little
room
and
take
my
clothes
off.
he
came
in
and...
spanked
me.
And
then
I...
I
was
so
frightened
I
wet
myself,
and
then
he...
He
hit
me
again.
And
then
I...
That
first
time,
how
did
you
feel

I
liked
it.
Would
you
repeat
that,
please?
I...

I
liked
it.
It
excited
me.
And
did
you
continue
Yes!
Yes.
Before
long,
he
only...
To
say
to
me
to
go
to
I
would
start
to
get
wet.

When
it
came
to
my...
My
brothers,
that...
That
was
enough.
I'd
have
to
go
down
and...
I
wanted
to
lie
down
Later
at
school,
anything
would...
Anything
would
set
it
off.
Any...
Any
kind
of
humiliation.
I
looked
for
any
humiliation.
Even
here,
when
you...
You
hit
my
coat
with
your
stick.
I
had
to
come
back
right
away,
There's...
There's
no
hope
for
me.
I'm...
I'm
vile
and
filthy
and
corrupt.
I
must...
I
must
never
be
let
out
of
here.

So
good
to
meet
you
JUNG:
You're
most
welcome.
Please.
Perhaps
the
terms
themselves
If,
for
instance,
we
could
come
up
we
might
not
encounter
It
would
make
the
teaching
Is

a
good
idea?
Once
they
work
out
they'll
be
just
as
appalled
I
take
your
point.
But
I
still
think
when
it
comes
to

Well...
It's
more
logical.
And
it
sounds
better.
If
you
say
so.

Are
you
still
treating
her?
Yes.
And
we
continue
For
example,
the
extraordinary
procedure
where
she
would
sit
on
one
heel,
and
at
the
same
time,
try
to

Well,

Is

Yes.
Certainly.
Hmm.
Almost

No,

I
don't
think
you
have
a
notion
of
the
opposition
to

work.

I'm

out

I
can
assure
you
that

will
still
be

ask

to
grant

don't
think

What
does
any
in
the
twilight
of

life?
Grandchildren,
grandsons.

when
I
presented
him

And
now

all

can
think

institution.

you're

Without

Dear
Miss
Spielrein.
Dr.
Jung
is
a
good

whom
I
believe
to
be
incapable
What
I
infer
from
your
letter
is
that
you
used
to
be
close
friends,
If
this
is
the
case,
whether
the
feelings
are
not
best
suppressed
and
without
the
intervention
of
third
persons
such
as
myself.

Herr
Doctor.
Fräulein
Spielrein.
What
is
it?
I
heard
you
were
leaving
As
you
see.
People
say
it's
because
I've
been
planning
Well,
I'm
sorry
if
I
precipitated
it.
You've
always
been

had
a

The
thing
that
shone
through
But
what
was
also
clear
You
let

think
that
I
don't
see
that
I've
come
here
to
ask
you
What?
I
want
you
to
write
to
him,
Then
I
want
him
to
write
to
me
again
Are
you
blackmailing
me?
I'm
asking
you
to
tell
the
truth.
Why
is
this
so
important
to
you?
I
want
him
to
take
me
JUNG:
It
has
to
be
him.
You
don't
feel
the
same
way
I'm
disappointed
by
his
insistence
that
nothing
can
or
transitory
intelligence
All
the
same,
will
you
write
to
him?
I
could
have
damaged
you,
Far
worse
than
I
did.
I
chose
not
to.
All
right,
I'll
do
it.
Thank
you.
It
means
everything
to
me.
Are
you
going
somewhere
Berlin,
with
my
parents.
But
you
are
going
to
come
back
Of
course.
I'm
going
to
America
with

That's
nice.
Goodbye.

JUNG:
In
view
of

the
what
I
did
was
indefensible.
I
confess
this
very
unhappily

FREUD:
Dear
Miss
Spielrein,
But
the
fact
that
I
was
wrong

that

man
is

be
blamed

my
own
need

accept
my
admiration
in
which
you
have

Do
we
have

have

I've
always
been

made

foolish
error.

Yes.
It's
gonna

hope
you're

go
this
way.

do
you

I
left

afraid
she's
booked

JUNG:
I
was
on
the
Swiss-Austrian
border

was
a
long
wait
because

noticed
a
decrepit
wearing

old

And
I
was
watching
him
with
his
melancholy
when
someone
said
to
me,
He's
a
ghost

still
hasn't

Is
that
the
whole
dream?
All
I
can
remember.
Did
you
say
Yes.
Must
have
something

think
so?

Everybody's
being
searched.
Perhaps
that's
an
indication
that
ideas
which
used
are
now
subject
to

most
You
mean
the
ideas
And
I'm
afraid
the
old
relic
shuffling
must
almost
certainly
be

Whom
you
very
mercifully
wish
A
humane
death
wish.
Perhaps
the
fact
simply
indicated
Oh.
Yes.
So
you
agree
Well,
I
didn't
say
that.
No.
Never
mind.
It's
a
most
entertaining
example.
What
about
you?
Mm.

had
a
most
elaborate
dream
Particularly
rich.
Well,
let's
hear
it.
I'd
love
to
tell
you,
Why
ever
not?
I
wouldn't
want
to
risk


Take
it
from

idea
was

for

Herr

Oh,
yes,

course.

kept
insisting

was
the
kind
for
your

It
certainly
is
a
very
fascinating
But

we're
to
consider
it,
there
are
one
or
two
mistakes
Of
course.
Might
you
have
a
little
time

When
I
left

hospital,
I
was
afraid
it'd
take
years
but
I'm
already
under
siege.

don't
see
why
won't
make
your
dissertation

you
think
we'd
be
able

It's
always
going
to
be
something
Yes.
But
I
believe
we
have
the
character

hope
so.
I
somehow
imagined
you'd
have
No.
You
were
the
jewel
of
great
price.
Shall
we
say
this
time
And
I'll
start
gently
Explain
this
analogy
you
make
between

sex

Professor
Freud
arises
from
a
simple
urge
If
he's
right,
the
question
is:
Why
is
this
urge
so
often
You
had
a
theory
involving
and
self-destruction,
Well,
suppose
we
think
Losing
oneself,
as
you
say,
In
other
words,
destroying
Wouldn't
the
ego,
in
self-defense,
For

not
for

reasons?

saying

want
to

maybe.
Please
don't

Do
you
really
think
the

drive
Yes,
at
the
same
time
in
the
sense
that
it
can
produce

destruction
But
the
individual
must

of

self-annihilating

I
fought
against
the
idea

I
suppose
there
must
be
between

and

I
don't
feel
the
relationship
but
I'm
grateful
to
you
in
such
a
stimulating
way.
The
only
slight
shock
at
the
very
end
of
your
paper,
Are
you
completely
opposed
to
any
kind
of
religious
dimension
In
general,
I
don't
care
if

long

Is
that
what's
at
the
bottom
I
have
no
dispute
with

was

about

wants
to
say,

agree
with

I've
noticed
that
in
crucial
areas
between
Dr.
Jung
and
myself,
I
thought
you
had
no
dispute

You
still
love
him.

not

Why?
What's

haven't
discussed

You

go

hope

We
have
to
go
into
We
have
to
go
back
to
the
sources
I
don't
want
to
just
show
the
patient
his
illness,
I
want
to
find
a
way
to
help
the
on
a
journey,
at
the
end
is
waiting
It's
no
good
making
yourself
ill
Only
the
wounded
physician
I'm
told
you
have
a
new
mistress.
Is
that
right?
What's
her
name?
Toni.
Is
she
like
me?
She's
an
ex-patient?
Jewish?
Yes.
Half
Jewish.
Training
to
be
an
analyst?
But
she's
not
like
me?
Of
course
How
do
you
make
it
work?
I
don't
know.
Emma,
as
you've
seen,
Toni
is
the
perfume
in
the
air.

My
love
for
you
was
the
most
For
better
or
worse,
it
made
me
understand
who
I
am.
This
should
be
mine.
Yes.
Sometimes
you
have
to
do
just
to
be
able
to
go
on
living.
