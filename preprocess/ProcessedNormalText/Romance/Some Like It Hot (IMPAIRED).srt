Supposin'
I
gotta
go...
-
Fight
it.
-
Suppose
it's
an
emergency.
Hey,
Bienstock.
You
know,
there's
Funny?
In
what
way?
I
don't
know,
That's
one
thing
about
an
ulcer.
It's
like
having
a
All
right.
You
watch
your
ulcers,
OK,
everybody
settle
down
and
go
to
bed.
-
Good
night,
Daphne.


I'm
a
girl.
I'm
a
girl.
I
wish
I
were
dead.
I'm
a
girl...

I'm
a

Daphne.
Daphne.
Sugar.
I
wanted
to
thank
you
for
Oh...
It's
nothing.
I,
uh...
I
just
thought
that
If
it
wasn't
for
you,
I'd
be
out
in
the
middle
of
nowhere,
Oh...
It's
freezing
outside.
I
mean,
when
I
think
about
you
If
there's
ever
anything
I
can
think
of
a
million
things.
-
That's
one
of
'em.
-
It's
Sweet
Sue.
I
don't
want
her
Oh,
well,
we
won't
tell
anybody.
Maybe
I'd
better
stay
here
You
stay
here
as
long
as
you
like.
I'm
not
crowding
you,
am
I?
No.
It's
nice
and
cozy.
When
I
was
a
little
girl,
I'd
crawl
into
bed
with
my
sister.
We'd
cuddle
up
under
the
covers
and
and
were
trying
to
find
our
way
out.

Very
interesting.
-
Anything
wrong?
You
poor
thing.
That's
ridiculous.
-
Your
head's
hot.
-
You've
got
cold
feet.
Here,
let
me
warm
them
up
a
little.
-
There.
Isn't
that
better?
-
What'd
you
say?
I'd
better
go
before
I'm
not
that
sick.
I've
got
very
low
resistance.
Uh...
Sugar,
if
you
feel
you're
the
best
thing
in
the
world
-
You've
got
some?
Don't
move.
Shh!
-
Hold
on.
Up.
Up.

-
Are
you
all
right?
-
How's
the
bottle?
-
You'd
better
get
some
cups.
Oh,
I
tell
you,
my
dear,
Put
on
the
lights.
No
lights.
We
don't
want
them
-
But
I
might
spill
some.
Spills,
thrills,
laughs
and
games.
This
may
even
turn
out
-
What's
the
surprise?
-
When?
That'll
put
hair
on
your
chest.
No
fair
guessing.
Is
this
a
private
clambake,
Yes,
it's
private.
Please,
go
away.
Dolores,
do
you
still
-
Sure.
We've
got
bourbon.
-
OK.
-
Bring
the
cocktail
shaker.
You're
gonna
spoil
my
surprise.
-
Hey,
honey,
what's
up?
A
party?
I'll
get
a
cocktail
shaker,
OK.
Hey,
Rosella,
-
Yeah?
-
No,
but
Stella
has.
OK.
-
Hey,
there's
a
party
in
upper
7.
-
Here's
the
vermouth.
Will
you
please
go
away?
I
brought
some
cheese
and
crackers
-
What
is
this?
This
is
a
party
for
two.
Ten
cups?
-
Please,
girls.
Will
you
stop
this?
Southern
Comf...?
Shh!
Girls,
you'll
wake
up
Watch
that
corkscrew.
-
Here's
a
cracker.
Will
you
girls
go
away
Here's
the
cocktail
shaker.
-
I
wish
we
had
some
ice.
13
girls
in
a
berth
is
bad
luck.
-
Pass
me
the
peanut
butter.
No
more
food.
Hey.
Have
you
got
any
-
Hm?

Maraschino
cherries?
What's
going
on
here?
Daphne.
Daphne,
where
are
you?
It's
not
my
fault.
I
didn't
invite
'em.
Come
on,
girls,
break
it
up.
You
heard
Josephine.
Girls.
-
Not
you,
Sugar.
Get
out.
Get
out!
That's
right,
Sugar.
-
Shh!
Have
a
Manhattan.
-
Pipe
down.
We'll
all
be
fired.

Come
on,
kids.
You've
had
your
fun.
-
What's
this?
Put
it
here.
Sugar,
you're
gonna
Yeah,
you'd
better
keep
a
lookout.
If
Bienstock
catches
you
again...
What's
the
matter
with
you,
anyway?
I'm
not
very
bright,
I
guess.
I
wouldn't
say
that.
Careless,
maybe.
No,
just
dumb.
If
I
had
any
brains,
I
wouldn't
be
on
this
crummy
train
Well,
why'd
you
take
this
job?
I
used
to
sing
with
male
bands,
Have
you
ever
been
with
a
male
band?
Who,
me?
That's
what
I'm
running
away
from.
I
worked
with
six
in
the
last
two
years.
-
Rough?
-
You
can't
trust
those
guys.
I
have
this
thing
Especially
tenor
sax.
-
Really?
All
they
have
to
do
is
play
eight
bars
and
my
spine
turns
to
custard.
I
get
goose-pimply
all
over,
-
That
so?
You
know,
I
play
tenor
sax.
But
you're
a
girl
-
thank
goodness.
Safety
first.
-
Yeah.
You
fall
for
'em.
You
really
love
'em.
You
think
this
is
gonna
be
the
The
next
thing
you
know,
spending
it
on
other
dames
You
don't
say.
Then
one
morning
you
wake
up,
All
that's
left
is
a
pair
of
old
socks
and
a
tube
of
toothpaste
So,
you
pull
yourself
together,
the
next
saxophone
player.
It's
the
same
thing
all
over
again.
You
see
what
I
mean?
Not
very
bright.
Brains
aren't
everything.
I
can
tell
you
one
thing.
It's
not
I'm
tired
of
getting
Ice.
What's
keeping
the
ice?
-
How
about
a
couple
of
drinks
for
us?
-
You
know,
I'm
gonna
be
25
in
June.
That's
a
quarter
of
a
century.
-
About
what?
You
know
-
like
a
husband.
That's
why
-
What's
in
Florida?
They
all
go
south
for
the
winter,
-
Gonna
catch
yourself
a
rich
bird?
As
long
as
he
has
a
yacht,
a
private
-
You're
entitled.
With
money
like
Rockefeller
and
-
Oh,
I
want
mine
to
wear
glasses.
Men
who
wear
glasses
are
so
much
-
Haven't
you
ever
noticed
it?
They
get
those
weak
eyes
from
reading.
You
know,
those
long,
tiny
little
That
bass
fiddle,

sure
Hot-diggety-dog.
Well,
happy
days.
I
hope
this
time
you
wind
up

So
the
one-legged
jockey
said...
-
What
did
he
say?
"Don't
worry
about
me,
baby.

Oh,
shh!

I'm
terribly
sorry.
Hey,
let's
rub
some
ice
on
her
neck.
I
think...
Ow!
You
dropped
it.
Oh,
that's
cold.
-
Oh,
no,
please.
Don't
do
that.

Help.
Help.
Help.
Josephine.
Please
stop
that.
Stop
that.

-
What
happened?
Uh...
I
mean,
I'll
see.

All
right,
what's
goin'
on
around
here?
Bienstock!
Are
we
in
Florida?

I'll

Which

do
you

Oh,
fascinating.
Do
you
use
a
bow,
Most
of
the
time,
I
slap
it.
You
must
be
quite
a
girl.
-
Wanna
bet?
My
last
wife
was
an
acrobatic
dancer.
She
could
smoke
a
cigarette
Zowie!
-
But
Mama
broke
it
up.
She
doesn't
approve
of
girls
who
smoke.
-
Bye-bye,
Mr.
Fielding.
-
This
is
where
I
get
off.
You
don't
get
off
that
easy.
All
right,
driver.
And
keep
your
eyes
on

road.
What
kind
of

Oh,

It
won't
happen
again.

Please,

are

did

I
wish
they'd
put
us
in

But
don't
worry
about
it,
Sugar.
414...
That's
the
same
room
number
my
last
time
around
with
a
male
band.
What
a
heel
he
was.
-
A
saxophone
player?
At
two
in
the
morning
he
sent
me
down

were
out
of
potato
salad,

So
he
threw
it
right
in

gonna

makes

Are

lull...

you
wanna

That's

Oh,
and,
uh...
get
rid
of
your
roommate.

-
Dirty
old
man.
-
I
just
got
pinched
in
the
elevator.
Look
at
that.
I'm
not
even
pretty.
They
don't
care,
It's
like
waving
a
red
flag
Really?
Well,
I'm
sick
of
being
What
do
you
say?
Let's
get
outta
here.
-
Let's
blow.

promised

the
minute

can

broke.

Daphne.
I

Why?
they

sue

for

I
won't

up

Which

it?
The
big
one?
Certainly
not.
I
don't

quite
agree.
Tell
me,
who
runs
up
that
flag?
-
Your
wife?
Who
mixes

Your

No,
my
cocktail

Look,
if
you're
interested
-
Oh,
I'm
not
interested
at
all.
That's
very
interesting.

How's
the
stock
market?
I'll
bet
while
we
were
talking,
Could
be.
You
play
the

No,

sing,
too.
A

Oh!
You're

We're

Syncopators.
Does
that
mean
you

Yeah.
Real
hot.
I
guess
some
like
it
hot.
Oh,
I
do,

As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
spent
three

Good

I
don't

It
was
such
a

know.

And
always
the
same

You

it's
amazing
we

I
would
have

I'll

I
beg
your
pardon?
You

I
have
a
theory

What
theory?

What
are
you
doing
tonight?
Maybe
you
could

I
would
like
to,

I

on,
dear.

along,

dear.

OK.
No...

is
it,
young
lady?
This
happens
to
me
I
recognized
him,
too.
Vanity
Fair?

Would
you
move
along,

He's
waiting
for

Yes.
We
have
to
be
very
careful
Well,

better
be
going.

you
both.

You
will

Oh,

I
can't

I'll
be
back
later.
I
have
a

Tell

all
about

about

always

is

on
Thursdays
-
What's
on
Thursdays?
-
You
mean
we're
alone
on
the
boat?
I've
never
been
completely
alone

in
the
middle
of
the
ocean.
We're
well-anchored.
The
coastguard
promised
to
call
me

certain
men
would
try
to
You're
flattering
me.
Of
course,
Oh,
it's
not
that.
-
Harmless?
How?
but
I've
got
this
thing
about
girls.
-
What
thing?
You
mean,
like,
frigid?
Well,
it's
more
like
a
mental
block.
When
I'm
with
a
girl,
-
Have
you
tried?
See?
Nothing.
-
Nothing
at
all?
-
That
makes
me
feel
just
awful.
Just
that
every

then
Mother
Something
goes

you
can't

I
was
in
love
once,
-
Would
you
like
a
little
cold
pheasant?
-
I
don't
want
to
bore
you.
Well...
It
was
my
freshman
year
at
Princeton.
There
was
this
girl.
Her
father
was
She
wore
glasses,
too.
That
summer
we
were
We
were
on
the
highest
ledge
when
suddenly
we
got
I
took
off
my
glasses.
I
took
a
step
toward
her.
-
She
took
a
step
toward
me.
Yes.
Eight
hours
later
I
gave
her
three
transfusions.
But
it
was
too
late.
Talk
about
sad.
Ever
since
then,
numb,
no
feelings,
like
my
heart
You
poor,
poor
boy.
Yes.
All
the
money
in
the
world,
Mint
sauce
or
cranberries?
How
can
you
think
about
food
What
else
is
there
for
me?
-
Is
it
that
hopeless?
Hired
the
most
beautiful
Got
a
special
tutor
to
read
me
Imported
a
troupe
of
Balinese
dancers
with
those
bells
on
their
ankles
What
a
waste
of
money.
Have
you
ever
tried
American
girls?
Why?
Was
that
anything?
Thanks
just
the
same.
You
should
see
a
doctor
-
a
good
doctor.
I
have.
I
spent
six
months
in
Vienna
Then
there
were
the
Mayo
brothers,
If
I
wasn't
such
a
coward,
Don't
say
that.
There
must
be
some
girl
If
I
ever
found
a
girl
that
could,
-
Would
you
do
me
a
favor?
I
may
not
be
Dr.
Freud
or
a
Mayo
brother
but
could
I
take
another
crack
at
it?
All
right,
if
you
insist.
-
Anything
this
time?
-
Terribly
sorry.
Maybe
if
we
had
some
music.
Look,
it's
terribly
sweet
of
you
I
think
the
light
switch
is
over
there.
That's
the
radio.
It's
like
taking
someone


You're
not
giving
yourself
a
chance.
Don't
fight
it.
Relaaaaax.
It's
like
smoking
without
inhaling.
So
inhale.

-
Daphne...
-
...you're
leading
again.

Well?
I'm
not
quite
sure.
Would
you
try
it
again?
I
got
a
funny
sensation
in
my
toes.
Like
someone
was
barbecuing
them
Let's
throw
another
log
on
the
fire.
I
think
you're
on
the
right
track.
I
must
be.
Your
glasses


I
never
knew
it
could
be
like
this.
Thank
you.
They
told
me
I
was
kaput,
And
here
you
are,
making
a
chump

Mineral
baths.
Now,
really.
Where
did
you
learn
to
kiss
like
that?
I
used
to
sell
kisses
for
the
Milk
Fund.
Tomorrow,
remind
me
to
send


Olé!
[drunkenly
humming
Whoops.

-
Good
night.
How
much
do
I
owe
the
Milk
Fund
so
far?
$850,000.
Let's
make
it
an
even
million.
I
forgot
to
give
you
a
receipt.

Olé!
Hi,
Jerry.
Everything
under
control?
Have
I
got
things
to
tell
you.
-
What
happened?
Congratulations.
Who's
the
lucky
girl?
I
am.

What?
Osgood
proposed
to
me.

What
are
you
talking
about?
-

you
think

too
old
for
me?
Why
not?
He
keeps
But...
But
you're
not
a
girl.
And
why
would
a
guy
Security.
-
Jerry,
lie
down.
You're
not
well.
I'm
not
stupid.
-
I'll
say
there
is.
We
need
her
approval.
But
I'm
not
-
Jerry,
there's
another
problem.
-
Like
your
honeymoon.
He
wants
to
go
to
the
Riviera,
Jerry,
you're
outta
your
mind.
I
don't
expect
it
to
last.
I'll
tell
him
-
Like
when?
Then
we
get
a
quick
annulment,
and
I
keep
gettin'
those
Jerry...
Jerry,
listen
to
me.
There
are
laws,
conventions.
Shh!
Joe,
this
may
be
my
last
chance
Jerry,
will
you
take
my
advice?
Just
keep
telling
yourself
you're
a
boy.
-
I'm
a
boy.
Oh,
I'm
a
boy,
I'm
a
boy,
I'm
a...

I
wish
I
were
dead.
What
am
I
gonna
do
-
What
engagement
present?
Hey,
these
are
real
diamonds.
Of
course
they're
real.
I
guess
I'll
have
Wait
a
minute,
Jerry.
After
all,
we
don't
wanna
-
Huh?
-

Just
a
minute.
Come
in.
I
thought
I
heard
voices.
I
don't
feel
like
going
to
sleep.
-
What
you
need
is
a
slug
of
bourbon.
-
Did
you
have
a
nice
time?
It
was
suicidally
beautiful.
Did
he
get
fresh?
Of
course
not.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
-
You
see,
he
needs
help.
Talk
about
elegant.
Candlelight,
mint
sauce
and
cranberries.
Gee,
I
wish
I'd
been
there.
I'm
going
to
see
him
again
I
think
he's
going
to
propose.
-
As
soon
as
he
gets
up
his
nerve.
Daphne
got
a
proposal
tonight.
-
Really?
That's
wonderful.
-
Poor
Josephine.
Well,
Daphne
has
a
beau,
If
we
could
only
find
somebody
for
you.

Big
joke.
Where
were
you
at
3pm
-
Me?
I
was
at
Rigoletto.
-
It's
an
opera,
you
ignoramus.
-
In
the
garage
on
Clark
Street?
Ever
hear
of
Deluxe
Cleaners
Why?
The
day
after
the
shoot
I
cut
myself
while
shaving.
-
You
shave
with
spats
on?
Stop
kidding.
You
vulcanized
You
and
who
else?
Me
and
those
two
witnesses
your
lawyers
Boys,
know
anything
about
Us?
We
was
with
you
at
Rigoletto's.
Honest.
Don't
worry,
Spats.
One
of
these
days
That's
what
you'll
have
to
do
-
I
feel
like
such
a
tramp,
taking
jewelry
from
a
man
Get
it
while
you're
young.
Fix
your
lips
It'll
break
his
heart
when
It'll
break
Sugar's
heart
when
That's
life.
Can't
make
an
omelet
-
What's
with
the
omelet?
Look,
we
got
a
yacht,
a
bracelet,
We're
really
cookin'.
-
Joe!
Something
tells
me
the
omelet
-
Come
on,
Daphne.
-
Going
up.
Three,
please.
I
don't
mean
to
be
forward,
but
ain't
I
had
the
pleasure
-
Oh,
no.
-
You
ever
been
in
Chicago?
We
wouldn't
be
caught
dead
in
Chicago.

Third
floor.
-
What
floor
are
you
on,
sweetie?
Room
413.
We'll
be
in
touch.
Don't
call
us.
We'll
call
you.

I
tell
you,
Joe,
they're
onto
us.
They're
gonna
line
us
up
against
The
cops
will
find
two
dead
dames
and
when
they
undress
us,
-
Shut
up
and
keep
packing.
-
Not
that,
you
idiot.
He
wanted
me
to
wear
'em
tonight.

I
tell
you,
I
will
never
find
Joe,
if
we
get
outta
this
hotel
alive,
We're
gonna
sell
this
bracelet,
grab
a
boat
to
South
America
I
figured
if
we
eat
nothing
but
bananas,
Maybe
100
years.
-
Did
we
forget
anything?
-
Oh,
yeah.
Sugar?
-
Give
me
room
414.
-
Making
a
telephone
call.
We
can't
walk
out
on
her
Since
when?
You
usually
walk
out
and
That's
when
I
was
a
saxophone
player.
Mail
her
a
postcard.

Hello,
room
Ship
to
shore?
Hey,
Sugar,
it's
for
you.
Hello?

Hello,
my
dearest
darling.

I
may
throw
up.
No,
I
didn't
sleep
too
well,
darling.
To
tell
the
truth,
I
never
slept
better.
I
was
still
on
the
yacht
We
drifted
for
days
and
days.
You
were
the
captain
and
I
was
the
crew.
I
kept
a
lookout
for
icebergs,
I
sorted
and
I
wiped
the
steam
off
your
glasses.
And
when
I
woke
up,
I
wanted
Yes...
Now,
about
our
date
for
tonight.
Uh...
I'll
meet
you
on
the
pier
again
I'm
afraid
not.
I
can't
make
it
tonight.
Not
tomorrow
either.
I
have
to
leave.
Something
unexpected
came
up.
Where
to?
South
America?
Oh.
That
is
unexpected.
You
see,
we
have
I
just
got
a
cable

A
merger?
How
long
will
you
be
gone?
Quite
a
while.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
You're
not?
Well,
it's
all
rather
complicated.
It
just
so
happens
the
president
has
a
daughter
and,
uh...
Oh.
That
kind
of
merger.
What
is
she
like?
According

our
tax
adviser,

that's
the

By
the
way,
did
you
get
my
flowers?
You
know,
those
orchids
The
fog
finally
lifted
over
Long
Island
That's
strange.
I
sent
'em
to
your
room.
They
should
have
been
delivered
by
now.
Hey,
Dolores,
will
you
see
Yes,
they're
here.
White
orchids.
I
haven't
had
white
orchids
What's
this?
What's
what?
Oh,
that.
Real
diamonds.
They
must
be
worth
their
weight
in
gold.
Not
always.
I
wanted
you
to
know
how
grateful
I
didn't
do
anything.
It
just
happened.
Oh!
The
navigator
just
came
in.
Well,

happened
to

Your

Don't
worry.
What
did
we
do?

did
you

Sugar.

can
I?

I'll

Toothpick
Charlie.

I'll
bust

Charlie's

I
was

are
we
gonna
retire
him?
Oh,
we'll
think
of
somethin'
cute.
One
of
these
days,
Little
Bonaparte
will
be
singin'
in
the

choir
again.


But

time
we'll
make
