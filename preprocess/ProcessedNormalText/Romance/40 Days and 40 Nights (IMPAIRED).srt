It

-Ohh.
MATT:

explain.
It
starts
out

And
I
look
over
at
the
girl
and
whoever
she
is,

And
all
I
feel
is
emptiness.
And
that's
when
it
happens.

This

black
hole...
opens
up
over
my
head.
Again
with

Look,

been
six
months
And
you're
running
around
screwing
every
woman
in
sight.
You
want
me
to
tell
you
it's
OK,
but
at
some
point,
it's
not
OK,
What
kind
of
advice
is
that?
If
you
don't

my

How

This

internet
company.
And
Ryan

big
mouth,
huh?
-Morning,
ladies.
So,

Then

he
get
here
-Appreciate
it.
-Don't
worry.
Hey.
Dude,
it's
just
been
one
MATT:
Yes,
I
do.
I
got
held
up
at
this
import-
Some
party.
-Golden
Spear?
Their
mimosas
they
make
there
Go
straight
to
your
head.
I
used
to
know
someone
You
know
Tatiana?
Yeah,
I
know
Tatiana.
No,
she's
not
nice.
I'd
hit
that.
Yeah,
I
know
Merj.
And
what
about
that
really
That
was
funny.
What
really
hot
chick
The
expediter
chick.
-What's
her
name?
Nicole.
That's
it.
Man,
she
knows
the
guy,
She
goes
to
France,
Now,
she
is
-I
would
definitely
hit
that.
How
do
you
know
it's
Nicole--
Dude,
that's
what
the
banner
"Congratulations
Nicole."
Whew.
I
can't
believe
it...
because
that
girl,
you
can't
She's
so
hot
you
need
one
of
just
to
look
directly
at
her,
It
makes
me
want
to
just
and
just--
Yeah.
I'm
glad
we
can
connect
on
that.
Later,
pimp.
-Later.
Hey,
Matt--
Matt?
You--you
all
right?

-Unh!
-Oh,
God.
I
am
so
sorry.
-Are
you
OK?
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
Um...
anything?
Again?
-lt's
not
even
the
weekend.
She
met
someone.
I'm
sorry.
I
mean,
what
can
I
do?
-Tell
me
what
I
can
do.
This
isn't
really
a
problem
Listen,
isn't
giving
relationship
advice?
Relationship
advice,
yes.
Sex
advice,
no.
Part
of
the
priestly
thing,
is
not
to
have
sex,
remember?
lt's
funny.
-Sure
you
did.
I
guess
thinking
about
sex
At
least
for
some.
-Get
out.
-Good
morning,
Matt.
What's
with
the
purple
banners?
Lent.
Starts
today.
Going
to
be
a
long
forty
days
I'm
giving
up
my
one
vice--
those
precious
little
dipped
in
a
starbucks
mocha.
lt's
so
hard
giving
up
I've
got
it!
Jesus
Christ,
And
the
question
is?
-Nicole.
No
sex
for
Lent--
If
I
can
do
that,
That
isn't
what
Lent
is.
Lent
is
about
sacrifice
Lent
is
to
remember--
How
Christ
felt
I
grew
up
in
the
same
house
But
when
it
comes
down
to
it,
This
is
growth,
and
this
is
sacrifice.
Dude!
lt's
not
that
simple,
Matt.
It
is
that...
You're
right.
You're
totally
right.
Sex
alone
is
not
enough.
It
has
to
be
sex
You'll
never
be
able
to
do
that.
Just
listen,
here's
the
plan.
One--no
sex.
Two--
No
nibbling,
no
biting,
No
sucking,
no
fondling.
And
three...
no
masturbation.
You
won't
last
a
week.
Oh,
you're
wrong,
brother.
I'm
gonna
go
the
distance.

I'll
tell
'em

Ohh.
Ahem.
Do
you
have

Excuse
me.
Do
you
mind
if
I

this?
Thanks.
A
lovers'
rendezvous.
You--you
underline
words
and
then
look
them
up
later?
Right?
which
is
a
meeting
of
lovers.
I
do
that,
too,
so...
Ahem.
Matt?
It
was
on
the
cover

Can
I
borrow
Thanks.

Ahem.
lt's
been
really
fun
Same
time
next
week?
OK.
Bye.
You
are
way
ahead
of

If
I
were
you,
I'd
give
me
What

Think
you
can
handle
that?
I
know
window
treatments
Oh,
no,

Good.
You'll
be

OK.

MATT:
Hey,
Ryan.

Turn

on
here?
One--you
can't
do
it.
You
can't.
This
isn't
No

do
it.
The

think
you
can
go
Four--You--
-
Nicole
got
engaged.
Well...
I
knew
that.
I
knew
that.
just
because
I
thought
I'm
sorry.
I
had
to
hear
it
-Does
that
guy
know
everything?
I
know
that.
I
completely
I'm
sorry.
Just
explain
this
Nicole
gets
engaged,
you
decide
Haven't
you
gotten
to
the
point
Yes!
Look,
Matt,
Then,
before
you
know
it,
That's
part
of
the
game.
Did
your
brother
put
you
You
know
what?
He's
about
What
do
you
care
anyway?
This

You...
This
affects
everyone.
CHRlS:
Right
now,
lt's
a
minimum
bet
of
$50
If
your
day's
the
day,
you
win
and
a
bottle
of
champagne.
If
more
than
one
person
they
split
the
pot
of
the
day's
total
bets
I
go
forty
days
without
sex
But,
dude,
you
spank
it.
-No
jerkin'
off?
Yeah.
That's
why
There
are
two
things
one--
Two--will
it
be
some
lonely

How
will
we
know
that,
exactly?
Well,
I
can't
tell
you
but
I
can
tell
you
that
Yep.
Like
Ryan.
OK,
so
Matt
No,
no,
no,
no.
That
is
very
important--key.
This
is
great.
Everything
is
so
much
simpler
I
think
this
is
the
best
thing
You're
starting
to
feel
it,
What?
The
abstinence--it's
starting
No.
Not
at
all.
I'm
fine.

You
know
what
I
gave
up
Meat.
Why
don't
you
try
Trust
me.
of
commitment,
character,
which,
quite
frankly,
You
think
you're
the
only
one
A
little
willpower?
If
you
can
do
this,
You
have
no
idea.
What
is
so
hard
MANDY:
They're
guys.
To
them,
forty
minutes
They're
like
animals.
Their
entire
lives
How
many

MANDY:

Uh-oh.
You
are
so
bad.

-Hi.
Did
you,
um,
do
these
layouts?
I
helped
on
them,
kind
of.
These
are
amazing.
Thanks.
You're
like
this
Something's
happening.

-OK,
come
here.
Hey,
I
have
You
do?
Can
you
keep
a
secret?
Yeah.
Oh,
goodness.
I
have
this
tattoo
on
the
inside
of
my
thigh.
Yes,
you
do.
Ahem.
And
I
want
to
get
but,
um,
I
don't
know
Any
ideas?
I
don't
know.
I
was
thinking
about...
like
a
cute
little
pussycat
Do
you
like
pussy...cats,
Matt?
Yeah.
'Cause
if
you're
not
you
should
come
over

I
can't.
because
pussycats
They
don't
like
them.
and
hit
them
with
their
paws...
and
it
hurts
-Right.
Well,
OK,

Did
she
just
xerox
her
ass?
-What?
Give
me
a
call,
OK?
-Ahem.

This
is
a
photocopy
Yep.
You're
gonna
call
her,
right?
Obviously,
No.
Ha
ha!
As
soon
as
you
don't
She
photocopied
her
ass.
You're
doing
a
lot
of
laundry
Didn't
you
just
do
it
Just
keeping
it
clean.
Who
is
she?
Look,
I'm
not
gonna
and
build
models
-Oh,
you
like
her!
No,
no,
no!
Have
a
nice
time.

Basically
probability

Officially.
Officially

Officially.
So,

-Yeah.
lt's
my
new
thing.
Well,

was
a
party...

Don't
you
ever
feel
like
the
same
exact
people
Like
people
that
went
And
now
work
Yeah.
I
want
to
have
a
party
of
all
my
friends
and
if
you're
on
that
list...
or
you
know
somebody
then
you
cannot
come
in.

How
do
you
know
Nobody
on
that
list
like
you
did
last
week.
Or
not
talked
to
me.

So,
what
do
you
do
I'm
a
cyber
nanny.
What--what's
that?
I
spend
all
day
looking
All
right,
say
you
have
with
an
lmac
and
a
browser,
and
and
then
gets
-Probably
not
the
best
thing.
Like
today,
and
got
"eat
my
box"...
"Sandy's
hot
box"...
and
my
favorite,
My
job
is
to
find
the
site
So,
you
have
to
look
at

All
day.
Drive
you
crazy
after
a
while?
Yeah.
that
if
I
have
to
look
God,
yes.


What,
you're
going
What,
you're
going
Isn't
that
kind
of
getting
-No,
not
at
all.
Oh,
I'm
totally
into
her.
So
how
can
you
Listen,
you
haven't
heard
lt's
perfect
the
way
it
is,
and
we
are
and
it's
not
a
sexual
thing,
Dude,
you've
got
to
tell
her.
You
can
pass
off
two
dates
You
go
three,
Yeah,
yeah,
I
can
see
that.
Just
got
off
the
phone
There's
a
preliminary
report--
-What?
Different
girl?
He
is
taking
her
on...the
bus.
On
the
bus
where?
Nowhere.
That's
the
point.
He
just
gets
on
the
bus
Mmm.
If
you
want
to
get
laid...
you
take
a
chick
But
if
you
really
like
her...
you
take
her
That's
the
bus
for
Matt.
Yeah.
I
don't
understand.
-Why
ask
me
questions?
I
like
to
take
girls
there,
-Shut
up!
Are
you
gonna
be
OK
Yeah.
He's
great.
-I'll
be
waiting
up
for
you.
Oh,
really?
If
I
bring
this
guy
home
you
better
make

But
younger

Suddenly,

So
for
a
while

And
I
was
amazed

From
the
fine,

Nothing

And
a
bad
tendency

Ahh,

Hmm.

So,

Well,

was
a

and
another

and
then
the
most
recent
guy
went
through
a
phase
where
he
Where

I
don't.
They

They

What

you?
Any
criminal
or
weird
little
secrets
No.
Yeah.
I
didn't
think
so.
ERlCA:
You're

up-front
I
have
no
reason
Yeah.
It
always
catches
up
Yeah.
I

with
me.
Back
in
my
more
youthful,
Ahem.
This

I've
never
had
so
much
fun
Me,

Good

Please.
This

complicated

You

This
is
not
something

too

Hey,
it's
the
abstinence
guy!

What
is
this,
some
kind
No,
this
isn't
a
bet.
Don't
explain.
I
just
read
about
it
Erica!
Erica,
I
should
have
I
thought
you'd
think
I
can't
believe
the
load
of
about
telling
the
damn
truth.
I--I
did
this
for
myself.
I
didn't
think
anybody
else
Plus,
if
I
told
you,
-Are
you?
Then
what
is
the
point?
What
is
the
point
I
just
wanted
to
see
without
all
the
shit
Oh,
so
I'm
like
No!
I--Look,
I
was
going
and
I
just
wanted
to
stop.
I
wanted
to
stop
Not
that
I
was
thinking
I
just
wanted
to
stop.
And
the
thing
is,
it's
working.
I'm
glad
it's
working

You
stupid,
stupid,
Why
did
you
have
to
go
Look,
if
you're
so
ashamed,
I'm
not
ashamed!
Then
quit,
Matt.
Just
quit.
Nobody
thinks
I'm
not
fucking
quitting.
Everything
was
going
great
I
stopped
having
sex...
I'm
totally

I'm
finally

think
Fuck,

He--he

Apparently,

That's

I
heard.
So?
He

Not

No.
Yeah.
JERRY:

is
to
regain
the

very
easy
to
confuse
with

can
tell.
You
can
tell
by
the
kiss.
You
know,
the
other
stuff--
It
doesn't
matter.
All
that
matters
is
the
kiss.
How
do

about
me?
I
don't.

don't
even
know

can
feel
that.
Is

From

flower?
No.
No,

wanted
him

name's
Erica.
Good.
You
never
think
about
me
Not
even
just
a
little?
Let
me
put
it
this

I
have
thought
about

think
your
little
friend

my
little
friend's

maybe
you
should
go.
You're
saying
no
to
me?
You
always
do
this
to
me...
and
I'm
the
idiot
but
I'm
not
coming
back
You
take
everything
from
me.
That
is
so
not
true.
Oh,
yeah?
Name
me
one
thing

gave
you

So,
what
about
Leave
the
front
door

kept
meaning
to
return

It
turns
out
Are
you
expecting
someone?
Oh,

long
time
Yes,
it
did.
I
was
trying

take
a
part
And
I
closed
my
world
off,
and
And
for
a
while,
But
then
you
came
along...

didn't
help
anything.
Remember
