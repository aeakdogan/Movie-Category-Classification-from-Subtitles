Hello..
hello?
Oh,
hi.
Oh,
I'm
wide
awake.
Sources
are
telling
us
that
in
the
last
few
minutes
at
the
precaution
that
this
airplane
crash
was
In
any
case,
it
is
too
soon
to
determine
was
involved
or
whether
human
error
was--
-
Hello,
my
dear.
It's
freezing.
Thank
you
for
coming
so
quickly.
Of
course.
They
came
down
on
a
beach,
near
Pinewood.
You
should
handle
the
whole
group.
Really?
No,
you're
gonna
have
to
trust
It's
time
to
shake
you
out
of
this
I'm
not
in
a
comfort
zone.
Two
master's
degrees,
already?
That
sounds
pretty
cozy
to
me.
Okay,
that's
the
start,
mostly,
One
will
require
little
more
work,
He's
feeling
little
Uh...
Oh!

I'm
sorry--
Oh,
excuse
me,
could
you--
?

Mr.
Clark?
Come
in!
Mr.
Clark.
I'm
Eric.
-
Dr.
Summers.
May
I?
-
Yeah.
How
are
you
feeling?
I
feel
great.
Mr.
Clark,
I'm
a
therapist.
I'm
recommending
that
the
passengers
You
are?
Oh,
okay.
I
understand.
If
you'd
feel
more
comfortable,
we
could
meet
one
on
one.
You
make
house
calls?
Well,
it's..
not..
protocol..
but..
hmm..
What
does
one
have
to
do
to
become
Survive
a
plane
crash?
Uhmm..
You
have
a
very
lovely
way
about
you.
Hmm?
I
mean
you're
very
formal,
it's
charming.
Is
this
your
correct
Okay.
So,
umm..
Friday
at
five?
Tea
time.
Good.
Is
there
anyone
here
for
you?
-
No.
It's
okay.
Feel
better.

You,
too.

Claire.
Yes?
Do
you
have
a
sister?
Yes.
You
should
call
her.
What?
Better
now
than
later.
You
could
step
out
front
of
a
bus


-
Hi.
-
Can
I
help
you?
Oh,
right,
oh--
It
was
sitting
in
the
dryer
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
I
had
an
emergency
Um,
I've
noticed
that
sometimes
your
newspapers,
so
I
can
take
them
Oh,
no,
no,
it's
fine.
It's
no
bother.
Oh..
thank
you..
but,
you
know
what..
I
promised
myself
-
Okay,
good
night.
Claire?
That's
right.
-
Good
night,
Claire.
Anything
you
need,
Okay,
thank
you,
bye.




Hi,
you've
reached
Hannah,
Luke,
Hi.
It's
me.
Just
calling
to
say
hi.
Yeah,
bye.



I
was
at
peace.
I
always
knew
that
I
wouldn't
live
to
I
looked
around..
and
just
felt
such
Dean...
when
did
you
first
realize
Uh..
we
were
still
up
pretty
high,
and...
plane
was
just
cruising
along,
the
lights
went
up
and
there
was
a
flash--
That's
not
what
happened.
There
were
no
explosions
No
warning,
nothing.
That's
right.
Don't
tell
me
what
I
remember.
Okay?
Shannon,
Shannon...
you
said
that
you
looked
around
but
also
that
it
was
so
sudden
that..
So?
When
exactly
did
you
have
that
moment
Does
it
matter?
No,
of
course,
it's
not
a
test.
Janice?
Do
you
remember
any
of
this?
Dean...
there
was
something
you
said
earlier
beca--
Excuse
me
for
a
second.
I'm
afraid
that's
not
what
happened.
The
pilot
misjudged
the
approach
Mistakes
were
made,
unfortunately.
This
passenger
remembers
fire
on
board,
But,
isn't
it
common
for..
to
be
disoriented..
to
be
unsure
Yes,
but
it's
also
possible
to
be
where
every
details
and
Dr.
Summers,
I'm
not
trying
to
challenge
any
findings
I'm
only
thinking
of
the
patients.
Accurate
reconstruction
of
events
is
Thank
you.
-
Good
day,
doctor.
Where
are
you?
Where
are
you?

Hi,
you
scared
me.
What
are
you
doing
here,
doctor?
We
have
an
appointment.
Oh,
yeah,
the
house
call.
No,
it's
okay.
Wanna
a
fig?
No,
you
should
probably
wash
those.
So,
let's
just
clear
the
air,
okay?
Okay.
Cream
and
sugar
for
you.
You
are
very
attractive.
Thank
you.
Eric,
you
feel
fine
now,
But..
when
we
go
through
there
is
often
a
repression
Later
on,
these
feelings
will
creep
up
Do
you
paint?
No.
I
always
wanted
to
paint.
But
I
never
dared.
What
kind
of
things
would
you
paint?

God
you
just
can't
help
yourself,
Okay.
I
did
promise.
What
do
you
do
for
work?
I'm
a
VP
at
Hein
Dragg,
But
I'm
not
going
back
to
that.
I've
spent
most
of
my
life,
See
my
control
towel,
over
here?
Printer,
fax,
high-speed
Internet,
multimessengers,
it's
horse-shit.
Design
to
keep
people
away
Did
you
feel
that
way
before..
No,
I
was
too
busy
working
my
ass
off,
So,
you're
re-evaluating
your
priorities.
Well
put.
Eric,
it's
really
important
that
we
mean
Okay.
What's
the
first
thing
that
comes
The
wind
in
my
face.
Okay,
what
do
you
remember
after
that?
Walking
the
beach,
Can
you
remember
anything
else
One
of
the
other
passengers
says
that
or
a
loud
noise,
perhaps...
but
something
during
the
mid-flight.
It's
okay
to
cry.
I'm
not
gonna
cry.
Uhmm..
What
else?
Are
you
sleeping?
Of
course.
Any
dreams?
I
don't
remember.
Stick
around,
I
will
awake
you
No
thanks.
Why
not?
I
don't
know.
It's
frowned
upon
in
Isn't
that
silly?
It
is
silly.
Directions
to
the
group
meeting.
You
should
come
by,
Eric,
You're
like
a
dog
with
a
bone.
Thanks
for
the
coffee.
Hey,
Claire.
Drop
by
any
time.
Did
you
mention
me
to
Eric
Clark
-
No.
I've
never
met
him.
He
knows
personal
things
about
me.
Like
what?
Not
any
big
things,
how
to
How
does
he
explain
it?
No,
he
hasn't
tried,
How
is
your
sister?
Uhmm..
Emma?
Emma,
right.
-
She's
good.
She's
good.
Yeah...
I've
been
doing
some
research
that
may
have
developed
Really?
It's
a..
theory.
Most
of
combat
veterans.
So,
he's
a..
Hmm?
-
Yes?

Claire.
Did
they
even
find
any
more
information
Why
do
you
ask?
Well,
their
initial
assessments
This
one
passenger,
Dean
Haschle,
an
explosion
on
board.
They
all
have
a
different
story.
There's
bound
to
be
some
discrepancies.
An
explosion
would
cause
I
spoke
to
a
man
at
the
airline,
and
-
And..
Stick
to
your
patients,
Okay,
fair
enough,
but
the
huge
part
of
'The
truth
heals,'
who
said
that?
I
don't
know,
some
dead
white
guy.
No,
you.
Well,
how
are
you
finding
the
work?
Well,
I
should
have
been
doing
Better
late
than
never,
I
guess.
This
is
good.
This
is
good.
Does
anyone
have
a
contact
Not
surprised
that
he
isn't
back.
I
don't
think
this
little
spilling
your
guts
to
strangers.
Shannon..
have
you
tried
talking
about
what
you're
feeling?
Loved
ones
could
be
great
source
of
comfort.
Nope.
Are
you
all
right?
I'm
good.
I'm
little
tired.
Are
you
sleeping
well?
Not
really.
We
can
talk
to
a
physician
No.
Good
night,
Shannon.
Do
you
always
offer
medication
Oh,
Shannon,
I'm
sorr--
What
qualifies
you,
You
have
no
idea
Doctor!
Norman?
In
your
car,
please.
-
What's
the
matter?
Norman.
Please!
Just
bear
with
me.
Okay.
Okay.
Just
pull
out
here,
and
make
this
U-turn.
Why?
Dr.
Summers,
please.
Okay.
Put
on
your
seatbelt.
Where
are
we
going?
Drive
past
that
building,
Okay.
There!
That
man
was
here
the
other
day.
He's
been
following
me.
Who
is
he?
I
think
he's
with
airlines.
Why..
why
would
they
do
that?
The
other
night,
when
Dean
said
or
something
bright,
it
started
coming
back
to
me.
They're
saying
that
the
pilot
missed
That's
wrong.
There
was
an
explosion
on
board,
Why
would
they
lie
They
had
another
accident,
last
year,
A
mechnical
failure,
another
problem
They're
after
us
now.
Norman,
we
can't
assume
that.
You
don't
know
these
people.
it's
all
about
money,
they
are
capable
Norman,
I
understand
that
you
feel
and
paranoid
feelings
are
common
what
you've
just
been
through,
but..
uh...
I
don't
think
the
airline
is
Let
me
take
you
home,
where
do
you
live?

Hi,
you've
reached
Hannah,
Leave
us
a
message.
Hi,
Emma,
it's
Claire.
which
wasn't
easy,
but
I'm
trying,
okay?
But
we're
grown-ups,
you
know,
you
live
your
life
the
way
you
want,
I
don't
want
to
argue.
God,
the
phone
makes
it
worse,
uhmm...
Let's
meet
face
to
face.
Call
me.


Shit.

Hello.

You
started
to
paint.
Yeah.
Turns
out
that
it's
not
that
difficult
What..
what
is
it?
I
don't
know.
Give
it
a
shot.
No
thanks.
No,
no,
c'mon,
here.
No,
I
don't
really,
No,
you
won't,
c'mon.
C'mon,
c'mon.
Okay,
okay.
Nah,
don't
worry
about
that.
Uh,
okay.
Here
you
go,
okay.
Just..
just
relax
your
grip,
a
little.
Little
looser..
loose..
there
you
go.
There..
I
think..
I
got
it.
All
right.
Yes,
yes!
See,
you're
great
at
this.
C'mon,
keep
going.
C'mon,
you're
not
done.
Eric..
Eric.
Eric.
Eric,
c'mon,
please
talk
to
me.
Please
tell
me
What?!

C'mon.
How
have
you
been?
How
are
things?
-
I'm
okay.
Yeah.
You
seem
little
depressed
to
me.
Are
you?
No.
Why
would
you
say
that?
I
don't
know,
I
just..
I
have
a
theory
about
women
who
who
bury
themselves
under
I
don't
bury
myself.
-
Do
you
want
to
hear
my
theory
or
not?
They're
afraid
of
being
desirable.
How
touchy
feely,
Hey!
Thank
you.
How
did
you
come
to
do
what
you
do?
How
does
one
become
I
study
children
with
severe
traumas.
Children
who
have
shut-off.
Where
do
you
start?
Uh..
by
learning
their
language.
Most
of
these
kids
dress
up
the
facts
storytelling,
I..
and
I
find
my
way
back
to
the
truth.
Are
you
afraid
of
dogs?
Of
course,
not.
Because,
you
know,
it's
common
to
develop
phobias--
Claire,
I'm
not
your
patient.
I
was
using
the
term
generally.
Eric,
can
I
see
you
again?
Yeah.
In
fact,
you
know
what?
It's
a
key.
In
case
I
can't
hear
No,
I
will
call
first
next
time.
That's
-
Sorry.
I'm
not
gonna
bite
you.
Look,
I
appreciate
you
wanting
to
help.
I
do.
It's
a..
it
is
helpful.
It's
comforting,
thank
you.
Okay.
We
are
not
dating.
We're
having
release
some
of
the
feelings
I
would
say
my
feelings
I
will
listen
to
you,
and
-
All
right?
These
are
my
terms
now,
We're
hanging
out?
Yes,
quid
pro
quo,
tit
for
tat.
Tit
for
tat?
Shut
up.
Okay,
doctor.
All
right.
-
Bye,
Eric.
Bye.
'You
have
no
messages.'
Are
you
looking
for
this?
Yep.
It's
so
beautiful.
Thank
you.
And
you'd
look
beautiful
in
it,
I
bet.
I
don't
know..
not
sure.
I'll
just
fold
it.
Oh,
okay,
thank
you.
Sure.
Your
key.
Yeah.
-
A
lover's
key.
No,
no,
he's
an
acquaintance.
An
acquaintance
who
gives
away
his
key,
Actually,
he's
a
patient,
sort
of.
Do
you
like
him?
No.
No?
Look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
that.
I
don't
like
him,
he's
a
patient.
So,
even
if
I
liked
him,
-
it's
an
ethical..
-
and
then
you'd
have
to
stop
seeing
him.
And
you'd
have
to
put
him
-
Yeah.
Like
what?
Cautious,
missing
opportunities.
Well,
thanks
so
much
for
this.
Have
a
good
night.
You,
too,
just..
just..
Yeah?
Spread
your
wings.
Life's
a
moment..
just...
it's
done.
Oh,
it
is.
Right.

Yeah?
I'm
coming.
Eric?
What's
going
on?
Oh?
Uh...
nothing.
How
do
you
know
where
I
live?
It's
in
here.
You
left
it
in
my
place.
I
thought
you
might
need
it
Sorry
'bout
that.
No,
it's
okay.
So,
are
you..
are
you
okay?
Are
you
gonna
invite
me
in..
or..
?
No.
Got
somebody
in
there?
No.
I
mean,
it's
not
any
of
your
business.
Anyway,
this
isn't
my
normal
office
hours.
I'm
not
a
patient.
No,
you're
just
a
creepy
guy
standing
A
lovely
man.
Intriguing.
Okay,
good
night.
You
don't
think
so?
I'm
not
gonna
stand
here
How
about
the
intriguing
part?
Good
night.


Oh,
hi.
He's
very
handsome.
Okay.
Let's
get
started.
Why
aren't
they
here?
C'mon,
you
always
have
What's
your
theory
for
this?
Why
are
they
missing?
I'm
so
sorry.
Would
you
mind
Okay,
go.
What
are
you
doing
here,
Mr.
Arkin?
I'm
interested
in
You're
interested
in
Yes,
of
course
I
am.
You're
patients
are
highly
susceptible
So,
you
just
be
sure
you
haven't
been
Have
you
been
able
to
confirm
It's
always
a
human
error,
doctor,
Someone
didn't
work
hard
enough,
someone
made
a
mistake.
And
in
this
case,
it
was
an..
You're
blaming
your
woes
to
a
dead
man.
Stay
away.
I
mean
it.
Claire!
Eric?
Hey!
Eric!
Uh..
Eric..
okay...
stay
away
from
the
edge,
okay?
Just..
Come
on
up!
Uhm...
C'mon!
I'm
not
so
good
with
heights.

Are
you
all
right?
No..
I..
I'm
good.
I'm
just
fine
here.
C'mon,
come
here.
C'mon.
Eric!
Eric,
stop
it!
I'm
sorry.
Okay.
Here
we
go.
Do
you
have
me?
Oh,
God.
Jesus.
-
Stay
there.
We
can't
seem
to
stay
away
So,
what's
your
sign?

I
was
almost
married
once.
I
bailed
two
days
before
the
wedding.
That's...
that's
terrible.
Yeah,
it
is.
It
was
very
painful
for
her.
I
was
scared.
You
know
what's
scary
about
commitment?
Your
life
becomes
real.
It's
not
what
you
hope
for.
Your
turn.
C'mon,
give
me
something.
There
is
nothing
to
tell.
I've
never
been
close.
Sometimes,
I
left
them.
There
is
no
sob
story.
That
was
very
you.
Concise,
yet
vague.
I'm
not
like
that.
Clarity
for
Claire.
I'm
so
glad
I'm
amusing
you.
C'mon,
this
is
miraculous,
isn't
it?
That
crash.
It's
like
being
born
again.
Eric?
Eric!
Oh,
my
God,
Eric!
What?
You,
bastard?!

C'mon.
Yeah.
I'm
not
getting
on
that
thing.
Why
not?
You're
not
wearing
a
helmet?
For
crying
out
aloud,
c'mon.
Why
did
you
come
here
tonight?
Too
fast
for
you?
No.
Uh,
so
do
we
need
safety
vests?
There
might
be
safety
vests
in
there.
Aren't
they
called
life
preservers?
So,
uh..
this
is
a
nice
boat.
It
is,
isn't
it?
Yeah,
how
long
have
you
had
her?
Oh,
it's
not
mine.
Then
whose
is
it?
I
have
no
idea.
What?
-
What?
Eric.
Can
you
drive
a
boat?
Yeah.
Great,
that's
wonderful.
Wanna
take
it?
Oh,
no.
C'mon.

Follow
the
moon.
What
are
you
doing?
Going
for
a
swim.
What?
Are
you
serious..
it's
freezing.
No,
well..
yeah,
Then,
it'll
be
okay.
You're
just
looking
it's
a
normal
reaction.
Eric,
is
it
cold?
Okay,
I'm
not
falling
for
this
again.
Eric!
Seriously,
it's
not
funny.
Eric!
Eric!

I'm
coming,
Eric!
Eric!
You've
scared
the
hell
out
of
me!
I
thought
you
were
drowning.
No.
Why
are
you
wearing
your
clothes?
Did
you
jump
in
to
save
me?
No.
Come
here.
Where
are
you
going?
C'mon,
come
back.
See.
It's
not
so
cold.
No,
it's
not.

Oh,
God.
What?
I'm
a
mess.
-
Too
late,
Claire.
To
scare
me
away.
Eric...
the
first
time
we
met,
Do
you
have
one?
Yeah.
Yeah,
you
seemed
to
know
that.
Maybe,
is
that,
bossy,
Not..
you're..
Anyway,
Emma's
older.
What
is
she
like?
She's
an
activist,
a
risk-taker.
She's
a
really
good
mom.
She's
got
many
things.
Ah...
so,
what's
the
problem?
She
called
me
a
coward,
I
said
some
pretty
horrible
things
to
her.
Stuff
I
shouldn't
have
said,
Anyway,
we
haven't
spoken
in
months.
Whatever
was
said...
it's
not
worth
it.


Emma?

Who
lives
here,
Claire?
Are
you
following
me?
Is
spending
nights
with
your
patients
Your
credibility
is
on
a
shaky
ground.
Perry.
Claire.
Perry..
ah..
hm...
there
is
a
man
Two
men,
actually.
and
another
one,
one
of
them
thinks..
Norman,
he
thinks
the
other
one
is
I
don't
know,
there
is
some
kind
and
two
of
my
patients
are
missing.
Claire,
Claire,
slow
down.
Who's
missing?
Norman
and
Dean.
They've
been
missing
sessions.
They're
missing,
I'm
not
sure.
Well,
just
because
they're
not
at
they're
in
trouble.
And
patients
fall
in
and
out
all
the
time,
isn't
that
common?
Absolutely,
right.
What
about
Eric
Clark?
What?
How
is
he
doing?
Oh..
good.
He..
he's...
responding...
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know.
Claire,
what's
going
on?
I
crossed
the
line
with
him.
An
ethical
line.
Our
relationship
is
more
personal

More
personal
than
Yeah.

Hello,
Norman?
Norman,
it's
Dr.
Summers,
Claire.
Norman.
Hey!
Wait!
Don't
go!
Hey,
stop!
Don't
go!
Help
me!
Please,
help!
Help
me!
Do
you
know
me?
No.
I
can't
remember
my
own
name,
Why
have
you
been
hanging
I
followed
one
of
them
The
guy
who
lives
here.
He
looked
familiar.
I
thought
he
could
help
me
But
he
wouldn't
come
near
me.
I
can't
get
anything
out
You
witnessed
the
accident?
I
was
in
it.
You
were
on
the
flight?
Yes.
One
moment,
I'm
sitting
there...
and
there
is
an
explosion,
what
the
hell
happened?
It's
okay.
Have
you
told
anyone
else
No.
Who
could
I
talk
to?
I'd
like
you
to
come
with
me,
please.
Perry,
it's
Claire.
I
need
to
talk
to
you,
Are
you
okay?



Oh,
why..
Mr.
Arkin.
This
man
was
on
board,
Mr.
Arkin.
For
a
woman
of
science,
you
have
Passengers
are
missing,
Mr.
Arkin.
Calm
down,
please.
Where
are
they?
Where
is
who?
Where
are
the
other
passengers?
Hiding
from
you,
I
bet.
This
man
remembers
an
explosion...
-
You're
making
a
fool
of
yourself.
I
know
you.
No.
-
Yes.
We've
met
before.
No,
we
haven't.
Can
you
help
me
remember,
please?
Help
me
remember.
We
have
not
met.
And
if
you'd
excuse
me,
I'm
busy.
-
This
man
remembers
an
explosion.
Where
do
I
know
you
from?
-
Back
off,
sir.
Back
off.
-
Please
back
off.
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
You,
son
of
a
bitch!
It's
okay,
folks.
You're
not
gonna
get
away
with
this.
This
man
remembers
an
explosion.
Sir?
Sir?
Shannon,
where
are
the
others?
Shannon?
Shannon,
what's
wrong?
It's
okay,
calm
down.
Claire.
Oh,
God,
it's
okay.
The
engine
blew
up.
It
was
right
outside
my
window.
Oh,
my
God,
Eric.
Sorry.
How
are
you
feeling?
All
right.
Where
is
your
family,
Shannon?
My
parents
died
when
I
was
six.
I
was
raised
by
an
aunt.
We
were
not
close.
What
happened
to
them?
They
died
of
a
fall...
on
a
trail..
he
was
trying
They
were
probably
crushed
They
left
me
alone.
They
did
do
that.
I'm
sure
they
knew
that.
What
would
you
tell
them
What
would
you
tell
them
now?
I
know
that
it
was
an
accident.
Something
that
happened
to
them,
What
else?
I
forgive
them.

Eric?
-
What's
wrong?
Eric,
what
is
it?
That's
my
dog.
What?
That
dog.
He's
buried
in
my
mom's
backyard.
He
died
when
I
was
six.
Eric?
I
didn't
survive
the
crash.
-
Eric.
Eric,
look
at
me.
Look
at
me.
You're
fine.
You're
here
with
me,
now.
You're
here
with
me.
I
didn't
make
it.
Yes,
you
did.
You're
okay.
See,
he's
gone.
Wait.
Eric.
Eric!
Eric!
Eric!
Eric,
stop!
Eric!
Eric!
Eric!
Eric!
Eric!
Stay
away
from
me,
Claire.
Eric,
let's
go
home,
okay?
C'mon,
let's
go.
Get
away
from
me!
Just
go!
Shannon?
Shannon?
-
Claire?
Hi,
honey.
Have
you
seen
a
young
woman?
She's
my
friend
Shannon,
Yeah,
she
just
left.
By
herself?
No,
with
a
man
and
a
woman.
Oh,
Claire,
you're
tired,
No,
no,
my
patients..
they
are..
They'll
be
fine.
Eric
will
be
fine,
too.
I'll
get
you
some
tea.
Eric?
Eric.
I
never
told
you
his
name.
Passengers
are
missing,
all
of
them,
they
are
missing.
What
if
survivors
weren't
even
I
don't
know.
I'm..
I
think
the
airline
is
One
by
one,
they
are
all
disappearing.
Maybe,
they
don't
need
you
anymore.
We
got
to
stop
this,
Perry.
You're
looking
for
the
truth?
Yes!
When
we
lie,
we
make
up
What
does
that
So,
there
must
be
some
reason
to
this
elaborate
theory
What?
Maybe
it's
gone
as
far
as
it
can.
They
got
to
you,
Arkin
got
to
you.
No.
Claire.
It's
not
like
that.
Don't
you
come
near
me.
Is
that
why
you
brought
me
in?
It's
not
me.
They're
dead.
They
are
all
dead.
That
pilot..
he
was...
he
was
tired.
He
was
in
the
middle
of
a
divorce.
He
wasn't
even
in
the
cockpit
Did
you
know
that?
Where
was
he?
He
left
it
in
the
hands
of
the
copilot.
He
never
should've
done
that.
It
wasn't
him.
The
passengers
saw
that
explosion
No.
It
had
nothing
to
do
No.
He
tried
his
best
to
land
If
anyone
made
it,
You're
wrong.
That
man
is
hero.
You
are
wrong!
No.
It..
w..as...
me..
What?
What
did
you
say?
I'm
in
your
seat.
Sorry.
No,
no,
no..

Good
morning.
Good
morning.
I
found
something.
What's
that?
A
list
of
passengers.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
It's
not
a
sort
of
thing
you
can
be
told.
You
gotta
figure
it
out
for
yourself.
When
you
are
ready.
Here
you
go.
Sorry.
-
Oh,
thank
you.
Coming
or
going?
Going
home.
Me,
too.
Eric.
Claire
Summers.
People
come
back
to
help
you.
Come
to
terms,
lead
the
way.
My
grandfather
came
back
for
me.
I
didn't
even
recognize
him.
And
my
dog.

Who
came
back
for
you?
My
aunt,
Toni.
And
Mr.
Perry.
What
about
the
other
passengers?
They're
like
us.
Making
their
peace
with
it
Nobody
survived
the
crash.
And
everyone
else?
They're
just
here
Can
we..
hook
up
in
town..
Okay,
I
promise
to
bite.
Uh..
okay.
-
Cool.
Hey!
Oh,
my
God!

Put
this
on.
We're
gonna
die.
We're
gonna
die.
No,
we're
gonna
live.
Look
at
me!
Emma,
Emma,
I
love
you.
Get
down
with
me.
Don't
give
up
on
me.
-
We're
not
gonna
make
it.
Yes,
we
are.
Yes,
we
are.
You
stay
right
here
You
stay
here.
Stay
with
me.
I
will
be
right
up
