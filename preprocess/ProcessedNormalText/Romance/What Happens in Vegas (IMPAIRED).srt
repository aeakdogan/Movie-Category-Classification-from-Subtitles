Do
I
attract
you?
Am
I
too
dirty?
Do
I
like
what
you
like?
Why
don't
you
like
me
Why
don't
you
like
me
I
try
to
be
like
Grace
Kelly
But
all
her
looks
were
too
sad
So
I
try
a
little
Freddie
I've
gone
identity
mad!
I
could
be
brown
Gotta
be
everything
more
Why
don't
you
like
me?
Why
don't
you
walk
out
the
door?
-
Here
you
go,
sweetie.
I
tried
banana
nut
sprout
this
morning.
Thought,
you
know,
thought
somebody
deserves
Yeah.
It's
good.
Okay,
so
I
made
I
thought
maybe
we
could
talk
about,
Did
you
just
make
a
plan
to
make
a
plan?
-
Did
I
just
do
that
again?
-
Sorry.
All
right,
I'll
see
you
later,
okay?
-
Hey,
hey,
hey!
Love
you.
-
Bye.
-
Happy
birthday!

Hello,
sir.
I
would.
I
really
would.
I
just...

Unfortunately,
I
don't
have
any
money.
I
don't
have
any
cookies.
Jack?
I
need
a
key.
Wow.
Wow.
That...
A
key?
What?
No!
I
want
a
key.
Like
an
actual
key
to
your
apartment
when
I'm
dressed
I
don't
want
to
live
with
you.
No
offense.
And
you
know
I
mean
this
You're
not
exactly
And
I
pride
myself
on
that.
I
gotta
go.
I'll
see
you
next
week.
Mother
of
the
baby
saved
from
the
fire
I
could
be
brown
I
could
be
violet
sky
I
could
be
hurtful
I
could
be
anything
you
like
Gotta
be
green
Gotta
be
everything
more
Why
don't
you
like
me?
Why
don't
you
walk
out
the
door?
I
could
be
brown
Gotta
be
everything
more
Why
don't
you
like
me?
Why
don't
you
walk
out
the
door?

McNally.




Not
now.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey,
hey!
Here
we
go!
Yeah!
That's
good
form
right
there.
That's
a
beautiful
veneer.
Just
throw
that
-
All
right!
-
Do
you
know
what
time
it
is?
We're
in
the
zone
over
here.
That's
how
people
lose
fingers,
huh?
-
You're
fired.
You
are
fired!
All
right.
I'll
play
you
for
it.
You
win,
I'm
out.
I
win.
I
get
a
second
chance.
It's
not
a
second
chance
Oh!
Nine-seven!
Keeping
my
job!
Yeah!
Okay.
All
right.
-
I'll
give
you
one.
You're
supposed
to
be
the
future
boss,
but
you're
too
busy
At
some
point,
you're
gonna
have

-
Eight-nine!
Unemployment!
Nine-nine!
Food
stamps!
Tastes
so
good.

-
Okay,
that's
not
even
a
shot.
Ten-nine.
This
is
it,
Jack.
-
You
know
what?
This
is
ridiculous.
You
can't
handle
the
pressure.
As
soon
Game
over,
Jack.
Don't
get
me
wrong.
-
Dad,
I
am
your
son.
Let's
go
clean
out
your
desk.
Mason
has
no
idea,
not
an
idea
at
all.
-
That
you're
pathetic,
or...
No.
No,
I
think
it's
the
exact
Which
is
what
I
am
right
now.
Of
course.
Okay,
look
it!
What's
that?
Vegas?
I
thought
you
hated
Vegas.
I
do,
but,
you
know,
-
because
it
truly
is
selfless.
Okay,
everyone
listen!
I'm
gonna
turn
on
the
lights,
and
that's
Oh,
that's
how
a
surprise
party
works!
Okay.
Everyone,
hide!
Hide,
hide,
hide!

-
Hi,
sweetie!
Welcome
home.
Happy
birthday.
-
Listen,
Joy.
We
need
to
talk.
No,
no,
no.
I
can't,
or
I'll
never
do
this.
Look,
there's
no
easy
way
to
say
this.
Okay,
then
don't.
Okay?
Just
think
it,
and
then
later,
I'll
try
to
figure
out
Okay?
Let's
just
go
inside.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no!
You
know
I
have
a
really
important
job.
-
Right?
So
when
I
come
home,
And
as
of
late,
it's
not.
Yes,
the
sex
is
great,
okay?
and
I
can't
tell
you
how
much
I
appreciate
with
my
butt.

But
the
rest
is
so
exhausting.
You're
so
on
all
the
time,
with
all
the
I
don't
want
to
marry
you,
Joy.
I'm
leaving
you.
Well,
I
mean,
this
is
my
place,
so
that
has
to
leave,
but...
Are
you
crying?
Surprise.
-
Oh,
shitballs.
Hey!
Hey.
Here...
Do
you
have
any
idea
You're
my
lawyer.
Well,
the
problem
with
suing
your
father
He'd
love
it.
He'd
think
we
were
bonding.

Maybe
he
would
be!
You
don't
know.
-
What
am
I
gonna
do
about
money?
-
Fascinating.
I'm
good
at
stuff.
I'll
bet
you
$5
Really?
You're
on.
He
doesn't
even
deserve
me.
Here's
my
thought
on
what
we
should
do
-
Okay.
we
get
some
of
my
brother's
to
go
over
to
Mason's
house,
and
when
he
answers,
junk
punch
him
and
then
he's
gonna
keel
over.
While
he's
writhing
on
the
ground
they'll
go,
"You
know
why!"
Wow!
Did
you
just
think
of
that?
No,
I
was
thinking
about
it
a
lot
You
are
a
child!

-
What
is
that?
What
is
that?
Joy,
you're
gonna
need
No,
I...
I'm
just...
I'm
just
gonna...
I'm
just
going
to
wear
it
You're
on
fire.
Man,
you
are
on
fire.
This
is
like...
I
mean,
you're
lucky.
-
I
don't
feel
good.
You
know
what's
gonna
What?
Where's
the
one
place
where
Community
college?
Where
can
you
go
where
and
act
like
a
total
idiot?
I
am
talking
about
one
place
Do
not
say
Vegas.
Please
say
Vegas.
-
Vegas,
baby.
-
Las
Vegas?
Swish
it
around
in
your
mouth
a
little
bit.
-
Vegas!
-
Carefree.
-
Spontaneous.
-
Vegas!
-
Vegas!
-
Vegas!
-
Vegas!
MAN:
Hello,
Las
Vegas!
Wow.
Vegas.
Everyone,
I'm
so
sorry,
so
just
bear
with
us,
please.

Okay,
your
fianc
is
one
lucky
guy.
I
love
Vegas!
Time
to
get
a
big-boy
drink.
I'll
have
a
vodka
and
a
Scotch.

This
is
where
I'm
passing
out.

Did
we
ever
tell
you
My
eyes!
It
burns!
My
head!
My
back!
My
nose!
My
nose
now!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Take
it
easy!

It's
okay!
It's
okay!
They're
gay!
-
What?

This...
No,
no,
this
is
not
We
just...
Let's
just
go
downstairs.
-
You
guys
aren't
gay?


-
I
got
this.
Just
let
me
handle
it,
okay?
Okay.
Curtis.
You
and
I
have
a
problem.
I
think
we
both
know
I
complain,
and
you
tell
me
but
we
both
know
that's
a
big,
fat
lie,
so
why
don't
you
just
and
type
in
those
special
codes
that
you
know
and
find
me
two
rooms
that
are
so
nice
that
it
turns
my
night
right
back
around?
She's
awfully
hostile
for
a
girl
named
Joy.
I'm
going
to
do
exactly
I'm
a
little
frightened
of
you.
These
are
penthouse
suites.
You
can't
get
any
higher
than
that
and
you're
not
allowed
on
the
roof,
Penthouse
suites.
-
Nice!
-
Yeah.
Well,
you're
welcome.
Now
watch
and
learn.
-
Hey,
buddy.
I
think
you
just
met
my
friend
back
there.
Kind
of
a
scary
person.
Oh,
Egyptian
cotton.
That's
nice.
I
want
to
apologize
for
her.
we
get
to
enjoy
and
on
week
four,
the
bill
arrives.

I
know
what
you
mean.
Look,
I
don't
want
to
push
here,
but
I
know
that
a
man
in
your
position

CURTIS:
Planet
Hollywood.
Yeah.

HATER:
VIP!
Hey.
So,
you're
from
New
York,
-
We're
going
to
Le
Cirque,
please!
Look,
I
didn't
bring
my
buddy
so
he
could
get
his
ass
kicked.
Right?
So
the
least
you
could
do
is
help
me
Your
buddy
wouldn't
know
a
good
time
Okay,
you
know
what,
Stripper?
Driver,
we'll
get
out
here!
Thank
you!
-
Okay,
bye!
-
Use
a
condom,
boys.
Oh,
come
on.
One
drink.
I'm
a
pretty
fun
guy.
You
can
ask
around.
Thanks,
but
we
have
dinner
reservations.
And
we
have
to
map
out
our
assault
You
have
a
plan
to
make
plans?
Excuse
me?
I
bet
you
look
really
good
-
My
hair
is
down.
I
dare
you!
Did
I
invent
hip-hop?
No.
But
I
was
there.
-
Thank
you.
-
So,
Joy.
What
brings
you
to
Sin
City?
You
know,
just
being
spontaneous,
cutting
loose,
like
everyone
else.
Yeah.
Me?
Oh,
I'm
here
on
business.
Big
business,
actually.
I'm...
I'm
a
pretty
important
guy
in
my
field.
Really?
No.
Actually,
I
just
got
fired.
So,
cheers
to
that.
I
just
got
dumped,
so,
salud.
Did
I
mention
that
I
got
fired
Did
I
mention
that
I
threw
and
the
surprise
was
that
he
dumped
me
while
they
hid
in
the
closet?
Wow.
Okay,
you
win.
Excuse
me.
I
saved
a
baby
today.
-
You
know
what
I
mean?
I'm
not
a...
This
is
my
lesbian
sister.
Tell
her
about
your
softball
team.
What
do
you
say
we
bet
10-to-1,
-
MAN:
Bets
are
right
there.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I
wouldn't...
You
roll,
princess.
All
right.
Go,
44!
44!


JOY:
This
is
my
party
trick.
Here
it
goes.
What
are
you
gonna
do?

You
know,
you
were
right
about
me.
You
just
cut
it
off!
It's
like
you're
trying
to
come
in
first
-
It's
like
Egypt!
You
never
felt
good
enough,
To
everyone
who's
ever
been
dumped

and
to
everyone
who
has
ever
been
fired,

when
I
say,
"Screw!"
you
say,
"You!"
-
Screw!
-
Screw!

Yes!
I
think
I
just
got
to
the
point
JOY:
Why
should
you
try?
I
work
80
hours
a
week
I've
been
so
naughty!
Out
of
my
way!
Out
of
my
way!
I'm
not
usually
this
honest.
I'm
usually
not
this
fun.


The
best
part
is...
-
We
can
really
talk.
Yeah,
'cause
you're
like
the
last
person
Ever!
Ever!
Ever!
JOY:
This
is
gonna
be
fun!


Oh,
God.
Please
be
fake.
Please
be
fake.

Oh,
God.


No,
no,
please,
please,
please!
You
can't
get
divorced
here,
okay?
Besides,
you
don't
want
a
divorce,
See,
what
happens
in
Vegas,
you
pay
for
That's
what
the
thing
is.
Was
there
any
part
of
the
night,
I
don't
know,
maybe,
say,
the
part
where
that
you
thought,
"Hey,
oh
my
God!
"This
is
a
really
good
time
-
Seriously?
I,
like,
threw
up
in
my
own
purse,
so...
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
-
Hi!
-
Morning.
Morning,
morning,
morning.
I
could
use
some
coffee.
Oh,
God,
yeah.
Well,
what's
mine
is
yours.

Here,
well,
you
want
to,
uh...
JACK:
Mi
coffee
es
su
coffee.
-
JOY:
This
is
good
orange
juice.
JACK:
It's
ridiculously
good.
-
I
don't
usually
like
pulp.
You
a
fan?
-
Jack?
-
Can
I
talk
to
you
for
a
second?
Yes.
Yep.
Talk.
Sure.
They're
so
cute
together!
If
I
could
make
someone
dead
-
Yo.
So!
-
Great
night,
huh?
I
mean,
you
are
a
lot
of
fun,
Joy.
-
I
am?
A
lot
of
fun.
That...
I
mean,
last
night
was
so
great.
Actually,
you
know,
there
was
like...
I
think
I
know
what
you
mean.
Okay,
this...
There's
no
easy
way
to
say
this,
Whoa,
whoa.
Wait.
Are...
Are
you
-
dumping
me?
No!
I
was
coming
down
here
to
dump
you!
-
Oh!
Jeez...
Okay,
so
we're
good!
-
Okay,
disaster
averted!
-
Yeah,
no.
Bullet
dodged!
I
mean,
pooch
unscrewed!
Free
at
last!
-
Thank
God
Almighty,
I'm
free
at
last.
-
Got
it.
You
just
seem
like
the
type
of
girl
and
I'm
not
that...
I
mean,
you...
Like...
No
offense,
Like
it
would
take,
like,
Marriages
are
an
outdated
concept...
Are
you
dumping
me
again?
-
I'm
in
a
really
weird
place
right
now...
Because
I
have
news
for
you,
buddy.
Okay!
Look
at
that!
"Employee
handles
criticism
poorly!"
Well,
then
maybe
considering
you
can't
even
keep
a
job
You
know,
the
one
person
who's
and
even
he
can't
stand
you!
Look
at
that.
You
had
to
come
all
the
way
just
to
prove
that
you're
not
a
robot.
Oh,
I
have
a
feeling,
all
right!

Yeah?
"It's
called
nausea!"
-
How
old
are
you,
five?
You
know,
this
is
why
we'd
never
work.
'Cause
I
could
never,
ever
be
with
-
Broken?
Broken.
You
know
what?
No,
I
don't
know
you,
You
know
what?
How
about
this?
Hey.
Hey,
hey,
hey!
-
We'll
always
have
Vegas!


What
the...
We
are
the
champions,
my
friends
And
we'll
keep
on
fighting
I'm
really,
really
rich!
We
are
the
champions
That
was
my
quarter!
We
are
the
champions
-
We
did
it!
No
time
for
losers
A
big
giant
check!
I'm
so
happy!
I'm
really
happy!
Oh,
my
God!
That
was
my
quarter!


Congratulations!
What,
you
think
this
is
all
yours?
God!
Yes,
it's
mine.
I
put
the
quarter
My
quarter
on
the
machine
that
I
was
That's
right!
Now
if
you'll
excuse
me,
I
have
a
giant
colorful
check
to
deposit!
Whatever
happened
to
We're
married
now,
remember?
More
importantly,
Your
Honor,
my
client
before
they
"got
married,"
three
and
a
half
of
which
were
spent
total
inebriation.
Mmm-hmm.
You.
Other
one.
You
have
any
evidence
that
you
both
that
it's
not
just
a
sham?
Let
me
see.
Would
a
note
do?
It's
a
start.
And
then
there's
a
photo.
Nice.
I
didn't
know
anything
about
that.
There's
also
-
a
video.
I'm
gonna
love
her,
and
I'm
going
to
provide
for
her,
-
'cause
we're
married!

We're
all
gonna
get
laid!
Was
that
you,
Cueball?
His
lawyer?
I
didn't...
I
don't
have
my
glasses
on.

I
don't
like
you.
I
don't
like
any
of
you.
Your
generation,
and
your
"I
want
it
right
now."
You
know,
gay
people
aren't
destroying
you
people
are.
Marriage
is
about
love
and
commitment.
Listen,
I've
been
married
for
25
years
and
granted,
there
are
days
but
I
don't,
because
I
love
her,
and
that
would
be
illegal.
And
you
know
something?
but
when
I
said
those
vows
out
loud,
This
guy
is
such
a
douche.
Before,
or
should
I
say
if
I
ever
allow
either
of
you
I'm
going
to
make
sure
and
I
do
mean
everything,
first
-
Objection,
Your
Honor.
You
can't
do
that.
Watch
me.
Now,
do
either
one
of
you
I
don't
at
the
moment,
Your
Honor,
You
see,
I...
My
ex-fianc
and
I
broke
up,
and...
You
know,
Mrs.
Fuller,
you're
not
helping
What
about
you,
pretty
boy?
-
Yes.
I
am
freezing
the
$3
million
and
sentencing
you
two
And
so
I
can
keep
an
eye
on
you,
I'm
ordering
you
both
I
want
you
two
to
listen
to
me.
You
better
play
by
my
rules
on
this,
that
is
so
long,
that
neither
one
of
you
All
right.
Anything...
I
now
pronounce
you
man
and
wife!
Can
he
do
that?
Yeah,
he's
the
judge.
And
he
clearly
wants
to
make
an
example
If
you
just
do
what
the
guy
says,
he's
gonna
be
forced
-
In
which
case...
...split...
...equally
as
marital
property.
You
didn't
do
anything
in
there!
-
What?
I
called
her
a
vixen!
I
called
her
a
vixen!
-
So?
I
can
do
anything
for
six
months.
I
can
not
wear
pants
for
six
months.
Oh,
I
am
so
up
to
it.
And
if
you're
trying
to
insinuate
then
you
are
sorely
mistaken,
short
bus.
Whoa!
Okay!
So
it's
settled,
then.
All
right.
Think
of
it
Be
married
for
six
months,
-
How
hard
can
it
be?
Excuse
me.
Out
of
my
way.
Thank
you.
-
Oh,
Jesus.
Here.
TIPPER:
Smile
for
the
camera.
Hi,
hubby,
it's
me.
Open
up.
Hiya!
JACK:
It's
all
the
way
at
the
top.
She's
here.

Okay,
don't
overdo
it,
though.
Hey!
Look
what
I
brought
my
new
hubby!
'Cause
I
want
to
please
him,
Hey,
look
who's
being
a
good
wifey,
Oh,
muffin
pants,
what
a
wonderful
gift.
I'm
going
to
buy
you
a
big
box
of
Tampax
'cause
that's
what
good
husbands
do.
Sorry,
I
can't
control
myself
I
just
love
you
so
much!
Not
as
much
as
I
love
you!

Shall
we,
Mrs.
Fuller?
Oh.
Here.
Let
me
get
this.
-
Let
me
get
that.
Oh.
Slippery.
Slippery.
What?


Sorry,
baby,
Welcome
home,
sweetheart.
You
literally
have
a
bar
It's
not
so
bad.
I
mean,
I
would
never
live
here,
ever,
but...
What?
I
ran
I
can
do
this.
I
can
totally
do
this.

JOY:
Oh,
my
God.
I
can't
do
this!
Don't
throw
any
of
that
hair
away,
okay?
I'm
saving
it
up
like
a
hat
or
a
sweater.
I
still
haven't
decided
yet.
Do
you
train
monkeys
in
here?
Seriously!
It's
one
thing
if
you
like
a
guy,
but
you
I
don't
care
for,
so
clean
it
up.
I'm
not
here
under
court
order,
-
Later,
buddy.
$1.5
million.
Here.
These
are
antibacterial.
Get
to
work.
That
looks
like
it's
gonna
be
Where's
the
bedroom?
-
Uh...
It's
in
there.
Yeah.
What
is
this?

Ooh.
That
was
close.
-
That
stinks.
-
Oh,
God!

-
Do
you
need
some
help?
You
should
probably
call
somebody.
What?
-
To
help
you.
No.


Smoothies!

-
Hon?
If
I
could
just
get
in
there
for
a
sec.
I'm
almost
done.
I'll
be
right
out.
No,
no.
"Be
right
out"
Like,
be
right
out
right
now.
I'm
almost
done!


Okay...

Oh,
yeah,
this
is
happening.
You
only
have
yourself
to
blame.
By
the
way,
it's
your
day
on
dishes.


JOY:
Freak.
Where
do
you
get
your
underwear?
-
What?
Well,
it's
comfy
and
supportive,
You
women.
In
the
beginning
it's
all,
like,
As
soon
as
you
get
married,
it's
nothing
You
might
as
well
wear
a
placard
-
that
says,
"We're
not
having
sex,
ever."
-
Ever.
What
happened
to
the
purple
bra
I'm
going
to
save
that

Well,
the
grownups
have
to
go
-
What
are
you
going
to
do
all
day?
I'd
rather
do
nothing
and
be
happy
Words
to
live
by,
Yanni.
Beat
it,
worker
drone.
-
Whatever,
loser.
Or
do.
Whatever.

I
believe
in
miracles
Where
you
from,
I
believe
in
miracles

Since
you
came
along,


-
McNally.
-
Who
is
this?
Get
the
Chonger
Coming
right
up!
Okay.
After
15
years
of
loyal
service,
which
means
that
this
office
So,
I'm
going
to
promote
one
of
you
skirts
And
that's
not
sexual
harassment.
You're
my
top
guns,
girls.
Do
me
proud.
Thank
you,
sir.
So!
I
guess
I'll
be
Maverick
Be
whoever
you
want
to
be,
-
Excuse
me?
-
What
is
wrong
with
you?
-
Oh,
you
eat
girls!
-
Makes
total
sense.
-
No
judgments.
Just
saying.
Ready
to
do
this?
Pretend
like
you
don't
make
me
vomit
Yes.
So,
Jack,
tell
me
about
yourself.
Hobbies.
You
mean,
besides
my
marriage?
My
hobbies.
Mostly,
I
just
like
loving
her.
It's
just
so
easy.
What
else?
Listening.
I
love
listening
In
fact,
actually,
just
so
I
can
write
it
down,
What
else?
Loving
her
until
it
hurts.
It
hurts.
That's...
I
don't
know,
Joy?
I'd
have
to
agree.
And
I'd
have
to
add,
you
know,
staring
at
him.
Yeah.
I
mean,
I
just
love
watching
him
be.
I
love
everything
about
him.
Most
people
would
be
repulsed,
you
know,
to
find
his
socks
sort
of
down
shoved
touching
them
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
They
might
want
to
try
and
try
to
get
the
stains
Not
me.
I
just...
I
love
it!
I
just...
Her
candles
smell
awesome!
You
know,
I
do
have
a
few
degrees,
and
I
went
to
a
bunch
Anyway,
I'm
not
buying
any
of
the
bullshit
Now,
if
you
want
me
to
report
back
that
you're
both
working
you're
gonna
actually
have
to
do
that.

And
love
Like
a
summer's
day
in
May
I
just
want
it
to
be
love
I,
I,
I,
I,
I
It
just
gives
me
tender
bliss
I
just
want
it
to
be
love
Yes,
that
is
the
topping
I
wanted
I
know
that
the
box
said
but,
you
guessed
it,
what
I
really
wanted
Thanks.
Uh!
Uh!
Uh!
Love
Who
can
tell
me
I
am
lost?
I'm
just
giving
you
Pay
attention.
It
goes
up,
and
then
it
goes
down.
Like
that.
See
that?
Isn't
that
magical?
Amazing.
Watch
one
more
time.
One
more
time.
It
goes
up,
right?
And
then
it
goes
down.




JOY:
No,
no,
no,
no!
Why?
I
really,
really
need
to
get
in
there!
Why
don't
you
just
use
There's
no
heavy
side!
-
You
got
the
window!
-
Where's
the
bathroom
door?
And
all
they
took
was
the
door.
$1.5
million.
Marriage
is
hard!
I
don't
know
how
people
do
this.
Men
and
women
are
not
meant
to
coexist.
And
I
haven't
had
sex
in
forever.
And
I
need
to
have
sex,
That's
a
self-esteem
booster
for
me.
-
I
don't
know
if
I
can
do
this,
man.
'Cause
I
haven't
been
sensing
that
at
all.
That's
why
I
did
a
little
research.
I've
been
looking
through
some
case
law,
you
know,
some
precedent
And
I
think
I
found
one.
Lafferty
v.
Holden.
You
know,
Tip,
Then
we
go
to
plan
B.
Mother's
third
marriage
club-footed
Cuban
bartender
The
court
said
they
had
to
remain
married
and
prove
Mother
wasn't
going
to
see
a
cent
of
that,
but
then
she
proved
and
the
judge
ruled
in
her
favor.
And
gave
her
all
the
money.
And
gave
her
all
the
money.
See,
the
judge
said
that
you
had
to
prove
that
you
were
trying
But
if
we
can
make
it
seem
like
she
isn't...
I
don't
know
-
Because
you're
not
a
very
good
lawyer.
There
should
be
a
law
But
then
again,
I
wouldn't
know
about
it!
So
if
I
can
get
Jack
to
end
the
marriage
or
cheating
on
me...
Not
only
would
you
get
out
-
You
will
also
get
the
full
$3
million.
-
I
love
you!
I
want
to
kiss
you.
On
your
big,
beautiful,
All
right!
All
right.
Okay.
-
Game
on,
sister!
-
Game
on.
Destroy
it.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
Jesus!

There
are
some
refinery
problems
-
so
let's
keep
our
eye
on
crude
oil.
And
I
just
heard
a
rumor
that
the
platinum
futures
Yes!
Yeah!

I
mean,
really,
let's
do
this
mother!
Right,
guys?
I
mean,
let's
buy
shit!
Do
you
see
that?
Do
you
see
that,
people?
That's
exactly
the
kind
of
spirit
-
You
go,
girl!

Oh,
my
God,
seriously,
you
guys!
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
What's
happening?
What's
happening?
Son
of
a
bitch.
Son
of
a
bitch!

-
Hi.
We
got
locked
out
of
our
apartment.
Would
you
mind
if
we
just
waited
in
here
He
said
it
would
only
be
a
few
hours.
A
few...
Sure.
-
Thank
you!
Also,
we
were
supposed
to
have
Do
you
mind
if
they
waited
in
here,
too?
I'll
jump
on
that
grenade,
too,
I
suppose.
-
Thank
you.
-
Thank
you
so
much.
Welcome
to
my
humble
abode.

Those
are
probably
my
friends.
-
Hi.
We're
the
friends.
-
You
look
like
the
friends.
You
do.

-
Hey.
-
in
my
living
room.
I'm
talking
about
the
fact
that
there
are
Oh,
my
God.
Okay,
there's
a
pillow
fight
Oh,
my
God.
Dude,
it's
a
trap.
No,
it's
not!
No!
This
happens!
No!
It
doesn't
happen!
HA
TER:
Get
out
of
the
house!
She
must
have
figured
out
Okay,
just
because
Joy
sets
a
trap
doesn't
mean
we
can't
play
at
You
call
Bear,
you
call
every
guy
we
know.
And
get
some
boring
stockbroker
the
kind
of
guys
The
more
boring,
the
better.
She
has
no
idea

JOY:
You
okay?
In
here,
guys.
Yo,
Jack,
what
up?
This
chick's
the
reason
This
chick
is
the
reason
-
Hey.
So,
look.
This
isn't
working.
-
Sluts?
I
know
sluts.
Which
one
of
these
ugly
losers
That
one.
The
pink
parade
over
there.
That's
your
wife?
Oh,
my
God,
she
is
so
f-ing
hot!
What
is
wrong
with
you?
Pick
a
team.
Pick
a
team.
-
Come
on.
Listen
up,
girls.
Do
whatever
you
need
Ignore
her.
Look
at
every
girl
in
here
except
for
her.
Get
him
drunk.
It'll
slip
right
out.
ALL:
Go!
Hi.
Oh,
I
get
it.
I
get
what
you
guys
are
doing.
Okay.
Well,
I'm
going
to...
Oh,
God!
If
you
need
anybody
to
talk
to,
-
Thanks.
Get
out
of
here!
I'll
give
her
the
money!
-
I'll
give
her
the
money!

Oh,
shit.
I'm
here
about
a
noise
complaint!

Someone
called
to
complain

-
This
is
the
best
party
ever!
I'm
arrested!
You
guys,
I'm
arrested!
Hey.
Sorry.
I
was
just
trying
to
find
some
quiet
-
from
the
craziness
out
there.
Sure.
Do
you
really
think
that
I'm
dumb
enough
I
think
it's
only
a
matter
of
time,
and,
yeah,
I
think
you're
more
Thank
you
for
the
vote
of
confidence.
I
appreciate
that.
This
must
be
so
hard
for
you.
-
What?
Okay.
I've
been
in
relationships
before,
Oh,
come
on,
Jack.
I
know
you.
You're
not
exactly
serious
-
Well,
this
must
be
hard
for
you,
too.
Yeah,
being
married
to
me
when
-
I'm
not
in
love
with
him.
Then
why
are
you
still
wearing
the
ring
Because
my
current
husband
out
of
a
vending
machine
in
Vegas.
All
I
know
is,
if
I
get
dumped
on
my
ass,
I'm
not
wearing
the
ring
-
I'm
not
in
love
with
him,
okay?
In
fact,
I'm
happy
I
spent
the
last
four
years
of
my
life
trying
to
be
and
you
know
what?

Okay,
that's
not
what
I
meant,
okay?
Hey!
Don't
worry!
Oh,
you're
such
an
ass.
You
know
what?
It's
irrelevant
now,
because
I
don't
care
Wow.
Thank
you,
baby.
-
That
makes
me
feel
so,
so,
so
special.
-
to
do
with
you,
Jack.
-
because
I'm
a
married
man.
We
don't
need
to
have
sex.
I'm
not
going
anywhere,
Neither
am
I,
-
Till
death
do
us
part.
-
It's
like
she's
always
there!
-
Left,
right,
up,
down!
-
I
don't
have
an
ounce
of
space...
...for
just
me!
Just
me!
-
And
I
swear
to
God...
-
The
other
night,
we
had
this
party...
...and
everywhere
I
look...
...it's
just
hot
tit
and
ass
everywhere!
-
It's
like
he
doesn't
even
want...
...this
marriage
to
work!
All
right.
You're
arguing.
Now
that
felt
like
a
real
married
couple.
You're
making
progress.
What
am
I
doing
here?
Oh,
we
could
kidnap
her
-
She
could
stay
at
my
place.
We
make
it
look
I
can
have
a
vial
of
crabs
here
First,
we
give
them
to
you,
and
then,
you
know,
so
it
looks
like
she
gave
them
to
you.
You
really
hadn't
thought
I'll
give
her
the
crabs,
easily.
-
No
more
ideas
from
you.
This
is
great!
Like
that!
-
What
are
you
doing?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Stay
with
me
on
this
one.
Huh?
God
damn
it!
No,
you
don't
get
it!

Jack,
what
happened
to
your
face?
-
I
fell.
Yeah.
I
hit
my
head
on
a
doorknob.
A
few
times.
I
fall
a
lot
these
days.
I'm
just...
I'm
so
clumsy.
Jack,
are
you
sure
Sure
someone
else
didn't
do
this
to
you?
I
deserve
it.
I'm
supposed...
I'm
supposed
to
line
up
the
hand
towels
I
didn't
do
it.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
Then
she
said,
"or
I
will
put
you
down!"
And
I
forgot,
and
she
said,
"I'll
stick
your
head
in
there
...Look
real,
but
don't,
like...
-
Oh,
God!
He's
gotta
make
it
look
real
Not
that
real!

-
Yeah!
Hey,
come
on.
Come
on.
Can
we
get
back
to
therapy
now?
Yes.
Yes,
we
can.

JACK

ANSWERING
MACHINE:
JOY
ON
ANSWERING
MACHINE:
because
we're
busy
loving
each
other.
JACK:
And
making
our
marriage
work.
JACK:
Leave
a
message!

from
Dr.
Twitchell's
office.
Hello.
-
Yes,
Mrs.
Fuller?
The
doctor
needed
and
she
was
wondering
Do
you
have
anything
-
The
doctor
can
do
4:00.
-
That
works
for
me.
-
Great,
see
you
then.
-
She
totally
bought
it.
-
Beautiful.

Come
on
with
your
come
on
That's
okay,
see
if
I
care
Blah,

Hit

your
best
shot
Fire
away

Hello?
Jack?
JACK:
Taxi!
JACK:
Come

Hey!

Hey,
hey,
hey!
Oh,

on!
Twitchell...
Twitchell...

Dr.
Twitchell
speaking.
-
Yes,
hi,
this
is
Joy
Fuller.
Yes.
I
got
a
phone
call
from
Annette
saying
that
our
session
-
I
just
wanted
to
double-check
that.
And
any
absence
It
is?
Asshole!
Trying
to
get
me
75th
and
Riverside,
and
step
on
it!
Okay.

-
What?
Good
luck
paying
for
that
cab

Only
five
dollars?
You
stole
my
wallet?

Lost
your
wallet,
huh?
Get
out.
Come
on.
What
do
you
want?
-
Show
me
your
breasts.
You'd
be
surprised
how
often
it
happens.
-
Okay,
one
breast.
That's
all
you
get.


CAB
DRIVER:
Nothing
like
a
nice
boob.
CAB
DRIVER:
What?
I
like
breasts.
Sue
me.
Is
there
any
way
around
this?
Does
it
look


Go!
So
1,
2,
3,
take
my
hand
and
come
with
me
Because
you
look
so
fine
-
How
many
for
10
of
these?
-
Okay.
Here,
take
five.
Now
you
don't
need
that
money


I
know
we
Before
I
let
you
get
away,
yeah!
TOUR
GUIDE:
There's
Brooklyn.
What
a
day,
huh?
Is
this
seat
taken?
Pardon.
Excuse
me.
Sorry.
-
You
are
so
immature!
Go
away!
-
That
really
hurt!
TOUR
GUIDE:
And
here
we
are,
Yes,
isn't
it
beautiful?
Half
an
hour,
people.
That's
30
minutes
I'll
take
that!
You
mind?
-
WOMAN:
What?
MAN:
Hey!
Well
I
could
see
But
you
were
with
another
man,
yeah!
I
know
we
JOY:
Idiot!
Before
I
let
you
get
away,
yeah!

I
said
are
you
gonna
be
my
girl?

JACK
SR:
No,
you're
wrong.
MRS.
FULLER:
You're
remembering
JACK
SR:
No!
It
was
not
our
first
date!
You
keep
thinking
that.
You
always
did.
JACK
SR:
It
was
not!
MRS.
FULLER:
Your
memory...
JACK
SR:
Mine?
Yes,
it's
your...
Hi,
honey!
Welcome
home!
Mom!
Dad!
What
are
you
doing
here?
Well,
I
got
a
message
from
your
parents,
and
I
thought
I'd
surprise
you
You
know
that
I've
never
No!
Really?
MRS.
FULLER:
Why
didn't
you
tell
us
I
know
you're
still
mad
at
me
but
you
get
married
and
you
don't
tell
us?
JACK
SR:
That
is
very,
very
hurtful.
-
Especially...
Especially
when
it's
a
catch
like
Joy
here.
-
What?
MRS.
FULLER:
We're
so
proud
of
you,
Jack!
We
didn't
think
you'd
ever
settle
down.
But
then
we
met
this
wonderful
girl.
JACK
SR:
We
are
very
proud
of
you,
Son.
-
Okay.
Love
biscuit?
Can
I
speak
to
you
for
one
second?
Of
course!
He
probably
just
wants
We
haven't
seen
each
other
all
day!
My
God!
when
your
parents
are
Well,
obviously,
you
haven't
No,
I
was
waiting
for
you
to
do
that.
What
if
we
didn't?
What
would
it
take
for
you
to
just
I
want
the
bathroom
door
back.
And
I
want
the
toilet
seat
left
the
F
down.
No.
-
One
time
up...
...and
I
make
the
call.
-
Done.
Well,
Jack,
Sr.,
you
know,
it
is
just
so
nice
to
finally
meet
the
man
-
I
tried.
Do
you
know
he
made
this
bar
Isn't
it
beautiful?
I
mean,
look.
Dovetail's
off
on
the
corner.
JACK
SR:
It's
off!
Well,
I
think
it's
great.
I
actually
think
that
Jack
I
don't
know.
Maybe
you
should
try
telling
Jack
then
maybe
he
would
actually
do
it.

What
are
you
doing
on
Saturday?
You've
got
to
come
to
Uncle
Pat's
I
would
love
to.
She
went
after
my
family!
Dude,
you're
letting
this
chick
Yeah,
I
know.
Now
I'm
going
to
figure
out
You
should
never
let
a
chick
That's
why
I
prefer
Yes!
Why
didn't
I
think
of
this
before?
-
Hi.
-
You're
Mason,
right?
I'm
Jack
Fuller.
I'm
a
friend
of
Joy's.
-
Joy's?
I
just
wanted
to
give
you
this
back.
She
threw
it
in
the
trash.
But,
you
know,
guy
code,
I
couldn't
just
I
mean,
you
spent,
what,
like,
Actually,
thirty
grand.
I
got
it.
All
right.
Well,
thanks.
Okay.
Hey,
how's
she
doing?
You
know,
she's
good.
She's
probably
put
on
some
weight,
From
all
the
emotional
eating
You
really
lived
up
to
the
billing.
Joy
told
me
Oh!
Yeah.
She
said
she
was
trying
to
be
deep
down,
she
never
really
felt
But
those
insecurities
are
long
gone
now.
She's
really
come
into
her
own.
I'll
tell
you
what,
she
not
gonna
be
-
It's
a
feeding
frenzy
out
there!
Well,
I
gotta
get
going.
My
Uncle
Pat
is
having
a
birthday
party
Joy
and
I
are
going.
Anyway,
I
gotta
go
pick
up
the
present
-
Her
idea!
-
She's
on
fire!
On
fire.
Well,
thanks
again.
(HEYMAN
NOW
YOU'RE
REALL
YLIVING
Stripper!
Hiya!
-
I
so
want
to
junk
punch
that
guy.
-
Joy?
I'm
so
glad
you
could
make
it.
-
Hi!
This
is
my
girlfriend,
Tipper.
-
Thanks
for
calling.
He's
over
there,
Do
you
know
what
it's
like
And
cry
your
guts
out
till
you
got
no
more
Come
on,
sweetheart.
-
to
meet
the
whole
family.
JACK:
One,
two,
three,
-
Rockets!
Who
wants
sugar?
Let's
go!
What
is
this,
like
a
five-foot
hoagie?
-
Hi!
This
is
my
niece,
and
BFF,
Sammy,
this
is
your
Aunt
Joy.
-
Nice
to
meet
you,
Sammy.
I
didn't
know
you
coached
Little
League.
Oh,
there's
a
lot
of
things
you
don't
know
Jack
wore
a
little
fedora
every
day
for
six
months.
Who
wouldn't
want
to
be
Indiana
Jones?
I
agree
completely.
I
mean,
Raiders
of
the
Lost
Ark
may
be
-
I
don't
think
I
like
what's
going
on
here.
She
doesn't
seem
so
bad,
Uncle
Jack.
I
think
you
guys
should
just
Make
a
hundred
pretty
babies.
You
told
her?
Yeah,
I
don't
have
secrets
from
Sammy.
Hey
man
now
you're
really
living
Well
I
just
saw
the
sun
rise
over
the
hill
But
hey
man
now
you're
really
living
Well,
ladies,
I
believe
Thank
you.
People
sing
Do
you
know
what
it's
like
And
cry
your
guts
out
till
you
got
no
more
Hey
man
now
you're
really
living
Joy!
Mason.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
In
Brooklyn?
Brooklyn.
The
B.K.
Love
it
here.
MASON:
Yeah,
they're
artists.
Yeah.
Hey,
you
want
to
go
grab
a
glass
of
vino?
I
can't
right
now.
Sorry.
-
Okay,
all
right.
Well,
maybe
next
week.
Wow!
You
seem
fine.
No,
I
mean,
you
look
great.
-
Thanks.
I...
Yeah.
-
I
gotta
go.
-
All
right,
well,
maybe
some
other
time.
Good
seeing
you.
Take
care.
-
Oh,
my
God.
You're
falling
for
her.
-
You're
falling
for
your
wife!
You
idiot!
-
She's
a
wily
temptress.
-
Yes!
Yes,
I
did,
because
that
is
what
she
is.
And
what
do
wily
temptresses
do,
Jack?
They
tempt
in
a
wily
fashion.
Tempt,
play,
tempt,
play.
Don't
let
her
play
you
Keep
your
eyes
on
the
prize,
Jack!
Hey,
McNally.
-
Oh...
No,
I
remember
when
I
didn't
care
I'm
sorry,
I
just
had
this
thing
Your
husband?
You
got
married?
Well,
thanks
for
the
invite.
Yeah,
no,
I'm
married.
No,
you
didn't.
Now,
listen,
Joy,
And
the
thing
that
I
value
most
So
I'm
gonna
be
honest
with
you.
Now,
Chonger
is
bringing
her
husband
-
I
think
you
should
bring
yours,
too.
-
You
can
count
on
it,
sir.
So
let
me
get
this
straight.
She
asked
you
Yeah.
The
most
important
thing
Do
you
believe
that?
I
was
like,
"No!"
'Cause
I'm
like...
I'm
like,
Jack!
You
have
got
pretend
to
be
the
perfect
husband,
when
you
have
them
eating
you
make
her
sign
this.
-
What's
this?
relinquishing
all
the
rights
to
the
money.
Right?
You
tell
her
if
she
doesn't
sign
it,
Yeah.
I
mean,
that's
not,
you
know...
It's
not
pretty,
but
we
can...
I
can
laminate
it.
-
I
don't
know.
Okay?
This
is
our
last
shot.
-
Hey,
McNally.
So,
where's
this
husband
of
yours?
I
just
met
Chonger's
husband.
He's
a
tool,
but
he's
smart.
He's...

So
the
spaceman
says,
He's
there!
I'll
just
take
this
to
him.
Mr.
Banger,
I
just
wanted
to
express
to
you
my
gratitude.
I'll
be
seeing
you
at
the...
The
dining
table.
-
Hey,
hey!

I'm
so
glad
to
see
you.
Muffin,
I've
been
looking
This
is
why
everyone
Let
me
introduce
you
to
my
friends.
Mr.
Young.
An
honor.
Hi.
And
this
is
the
rest
of
your
board,
actually.
Great
people.
Wealthy
people.
So
you're
the
lucky
guy.
-
Hi.
Jack
Fuller.
You're
in
my
seat.
Wait,
your
name
is
Richard
Banger?
Your
name
is
Dick
Banger.
Dick
Banger!
Dick
Banger?
You,
sir,
have
just
provided
us
with
jokes
Well,
you
must
be
Jack...
off!
Jack-Off!
Give
it
to
me,
baby!
-
Jack-Off,
buddy!
McNally,
where
have
you
You
know,
I've
just
been
Well,
you
gotta
learn
how
to
share.
All
right,
everybody,
let's
sit
down.
"Jack-Off."
How
about
it?
Oh,
boy.
I
don't
know
what
made
you
change
Thank
you.
-
"Jack-Off."
I
love
that.
I
love
that,
that
you
said
that.
For
a
moment
there,
I...
I'm
so
sorry.
MAN:
Joy,
come
on
over!
Joy!

I'm
on
it!
-
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!


One
looks
for
happiness
One
knows
that
nowadays

One
sees
a
crazy
world
-
Hey.
No,
not
yet.
You
better
not
Don't
get
your
panties
in
a
bunch.
Got
to
warm
All
right,
well,
call
me
I'm
holding
down
the
fort
in
the
meantime.
-
Yeah.
All
right.
Lavender.
You
get
on
my
head.
Oh,
my
God.
That
is
slick.
-
Can
you
believe
this?
I
guess
I
was
wrong.
What?
No,
you
just...
You...
I
like
your
hair
like
that.
Thanks.
Can
I
get
two
shots?
You
know
what?
Make
it
three.
Hello,
McNally.
-
Hey,
Mr.
Banger.
Good.
Cheers.
"Hello,
my
name
is
Joy's
Bitch."
How's
it
going
tonight?
That's
a
good
one,
McNally.
She's
very
serious
at
work.
You
don't
know
her
that
well.
-
I
wouldn't
lie
to
you,
Big
Dick.
-
Seriously.
-
more
than
a
good
dare.
Yeah.
You
ever
see
what
she
can
do
-
Unbelievable.
Shocking.
I
dare
you.
-
I
hate
you.

Very
good!
Very
good!
Terrific!
You
know,
I
probably
would
have
promoted
you

Get
down
on
it
-
That's
a
lot.
You
know
what?
You
shouldn't
do
that.
You've
got
this,
okay?
Throw
the
dice.
You've
got
this.
-
We
need
what,
a
seven?
-
Okay.
DEALER:
Seven.
Oh,
my
God!
-
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
We're
done.
Can
we
quit?
Throw
it
in
there.
Thank
you.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,

BANGER:
Come
on.
Don't
be
afraid.
for
best
team
spirit
goes
to
a
new
face,
and
one
of
the
funniest
son
of
a
bitches
And
I
think
you
know
-
Jack-Off!
Jack-Off!
Jack-Off!
BANGER:
Get
up
here!
Come
on!
Congratulations,
Jack-Off.
Well,
thank
you
all
I
have
to
thank
my
wife,
Joy.
She
probably
never
told
you
all
It
might
come
as
a
surprise
that
we
didn't
know
each
other
What
can
I
say?
You
know?
On
our
wedding
night,
we
were
so
busy
that
we
never
really
got
a
chance
So...
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
for
the
first
time,



First,
when
there's
nothing
but
a
slow
glowing
dream
That
your
fear
seems
to
hide...

You
hear
that?
-
They're
clinking.
I
think
that
means
they
want
us
to
kiss.
Well,
if
that's
what
the
crowd
wants...
Yeah,
but
if
you're
not
up
for
it,
In
a
world
made
of
steel
Made
of
stone
Well,
I
hear
the
music
Close
my
eyes,
feel
the
rhythm
Wrap
around
Take
a
hold
of
my
heart
What
a
feeling!
Being's
believing
I
can't
have
it
all
Take
your
passion
And
make
it
happen
All
right,
look.
When's
the
last
time
-
Really
happy?
because
if
you
do,
I'll
just...
I'll
have
to
cry.
Okay.
There
was
this
one
day,
before
the
Exchange,
before
Mason.
I
was
feeling
really
adventurous,
-
about
30
miles
east
of
the
city.
There
was
this
great
lighthouse.
I
mean,
it
was
just
right
on
the
beach,
-
You
went
there
by
yourself?
You
know,
I
just,
like,
sat
on
the
beach,
listened
to
the
waves,
God!
I
had
no
concerns,
you
know?
no
job
stressing
me
out.
I
had
no
one
to
please
but
myself.
-
That's
that
photo
you
have.
That
was
a
great
day.
I
did
take
myself
out
of
the
game.
If
you
stop
betting,
you
never
have
to
lose.
I'd
bet
on
you,
Jack.
So,
long
day,
huh?
Yeah.
So,
we
should
probably
get
to
bed.
Yep.
Can
you
undo
my
zipper?
-
It
gets
stuck.
Absolutely.
All
right.
All
right.
Okay.
There
it
is.
Thanks.
Hey,
I...
These...
-
I
wasn't
in
your
things.
I
can
put
them
back.
Good
night,
Mr.
Fuller.
Good
night,
Mrs.
Fuller.

It's
all
right
It's
all
right

Everything's
all
right

It's
all
right
Everything's
all
right
It's
okay
Okay,
I'm
on
my
way.
I
know.
It's
almost
over.
-
Joy.
Joy!
I
have
to
go.
-
Mason?
I
can't
talk
right
now.
I'm
sorry.
I
want
you
back,
Joy.
-
What?
I
see
that
now.
Seeing
you
the
other
day,
Not
that
you
didn't
before,
it's
just...
Sometimes
it
takes
losing
something
for
you
to
realize
what
you
had.
I
want
to
make
up
This
is
yours.
I
gave
it
to
you,
and
I
want
you
to
have
it.
-
Where
did
you
get
this?
you
are
good
enough
for
me.
I
mean
that!
JUDGE
WHOPPER:
Court
is
called
to
order.
Well,
lookie
here,
lookie
here!
Six
months
down
the
road.
We'll
see.
Now,
Dr.
Twitchell,
in
your
opinion,
Jack
Fuller
and
Joy
McNally,
obey
the
court
order
and
do
you
believe
they
put
These
two
have
a
lot
of
issues.
A
lot
of
deeply
unsettling
issues
that,
as
individuals,
Seriously.
But
together,
in
my
honest
opinion,
they're
perfect
for
each
other.
It's
the
real
thing.
Go
figure.
Well,
thank
you,
Doctor.
Tipper!
Hi,
Your
Honor.
Have
you
lost
weight?
Gotcha.
Let's
begin.
Although
Ms.
McNally
ran
up
$25,000
my
client
recently
spent
the
same
amount
for
materials
Therefore,
we
propose
The
original
$3
million,
and
$50,000
that's
already
been
spent,
that
leaves
$1.45
million
to
be
divided...
equally.
Now
that's
the
spirit!
No,
Your
Honor,
we
do
not.


Gold-digging
whore.
My
client
has
advised
me
that
She
just
wants
a
divorce.
Miss
McNally,
are
you
sure?
Yes,
Your
Honor,
I
am.
Well,
then
I
hereby
grant
the
divorce
Court
adjourned.
You
win,
Jack.
I
officially
want
nothing
from
you.
Oh,
my
God.
I
won
a
case!
Jesus
Christ!
Dude,
we
won!
I
won!
Yeah!
I'm
the
law,
bitches!
I'm
a
lawyer!
HATER:
To
me!
Anybody
need
a
lawyer?

And
tonight
I
have
to
leave
it
Time
heals
all
wounds.
Now
that
you
guys
are
officially
done,
Yes,
tonight
I
have
to
leave
it

Don't
you
come
up
to
me
Yeah,
okay.
You
don't
have
to
answer
that
right
now.
MAN:
Hey,
I
have
a
question.
How
much
does
an
island
cost?
And
tonight
I
have
to
leave
it
Yes,
tonight
I
have
to
leave
it
BANGER:
Now
we
come
to
the
final
item
Congratulations,
McNally.
Thank
you,
sir.
I
won't
let
you
down.
Okay,
I
think
I'm
gonna
have
to
Why
don't
you
just
give
it
to
Chong,
She's
good,
she
deserves
it,
and
besides,
-
Yes!
No,
I
don't.
But
I
think
that's
the
point.
I
would
rather
do
nothing
and
be
happy
than
do
something
that
I
don't
love.
Well,
I
lost
her
at
happy.
I
don't
know
what
the
hell
Well
done,
Chonger.
The
job
is
yours.
Thank
you.
So!
Jack
made
a
piece
of
furniture.
He
finished
it.
Okay.
Go
ahead,
Dad.
Nothing.
It's
good.
It's
really
good.
I'm
proud
of
you.
-
Thank
you.
Here
we
go.
...you
royally
screwed
up
It
was
a
big,
stupid
mistake.
Okay?
The
marriage
might
have
been
a
mistake,
And
I
think
that
anybody
could
tell
you
that.
So
why
don't
you
get
your
head
and
go
do
something
about
it?
Or
should
I
tell
you
not
to,
-
TIPPER:
She's
gone,
man.
She,
like,
lost
it.
She
quit
her
job,
Look,
I
don't
really
care
much
for
you,
and
I
want
to
cut
your
friend
Hater.
But
for
some
reason,
you're,
like,
the
only
man
so
I
wanna
tell
you
where
she
is,
-
What
do
you
know?
and
you
wanted
to
get
happy
again,
What?
Thank
you.
Okay,
tell
you
what.
We
both
go.
That
way,
when
she
sees
us
both,
she
can
make
up
her
mind
I've
loaned
you
my
band
saw,
Do
you
even
know
The
keys.
Give
me
the
keys.
Here.
Sorry.
Go
get
your
future
ex-ex-wife.

What
a
waste
of
time
But
I
never
missed
a
beat
Can't
explain
the
who
or
what
I
was
Trying
to
believe
What
would
you
do?
What
would
you
do?
I
once
had
a
grip
on
everything
It
feels
better
to
let
go
I'm
not
over
I'm
not
over
you
just
yet
Cannot
hide
it
You're
not
that
easy
to
forget
You're
not
that
easy
to
forget
I'm
not
over
I'm
not
over
You
found
me.
You
left
this
behind,
and
I
wanted
to
bring
it
back
to
you.
Do
you
know
how
many
lighthouses
-
How
many?
-
Really?
So.
Did
you
come
all
the
way
out
here
I
did.
So
I'm
going
to
get
out
of
here.
All
right.
Here
it
is.
When
we
were
married,
I
was
horrible.
Sick.
Just
wrong.
And
it's
the
best
time
I've
ever
had.
You
bet
on
me,
Joy,
and
you
made
me
want
to
bet
on
myself.
So
don't
think
about
anyone
else
and
just
answer
this
for
you.
Do
you
want
to
be
married
to
me?
Again?
You
know,
for
so
long,
I've
just...
And
by
not
trying
to
please
you,
I
think
I
became
myself
again.
I
do
want
to
be
married
to
you
again.
I
quit
my
job.
I
heard.
I
have
absolutely
no
idea
Well,
it's
a
good
thing
that
I
have...
Oh,
my
God!
That's
right.
We
hit
the
jackpot.
Yeah,
I
did.
Now,
Joy,
do
you
take
this
young
man
to
be
your
lawfully
wedded
husband,
Uh-huh.
...for
richer
or
for
poorer...
I
do.
I
take
him.
WOMAN:
Naughty!
Naughty!
Jack,
would
you
put
the
ring
-
Was
that
the
one?
You
may
kiss
the
bride.

This
is
the
greatest
day
of
my
life!
-
This
is
the
greatest
day
of
my...
Oh,
my...
This
is
marvelous,
simply
marvelous.
-
Bye!
Thank
you!
Have
fun,
you
guys!
It's
so
much
fun
in
there!

JACK:
Woman!
-
JACK:
Woman!

zoo
(SA

THE
BESTFOR
LAST
And
now
we're
standing
face
to
face

Isn't
this
world
a
crazy
place

Why?
You
know
why!
You
know
why!
No
one
here
likes
you
Go
back
to
your...
zoo
I
don't
know
why
And
I'd
love
to
split
them
wide
I
could
pretend
Can't
you
understand
Some
call
it
an
obsession
And
some
call
it
a
good
hate
And
I'll
just
call
it
pathetic
But
some
totally
relate
I'd
rather
go
to
hell
In
case
you
couldn't
tell
Go
ahead,
boy,
drink
your
drink
Can
you
learn
the
words
I
could
pretend
Can't
you
understand
Some
call
it
an
obsession
And
some
call
it
a
good
hate
And
I'll
just
call

But
some

you

friend
I
hate
you

friend

What
are
you
doing
later?
You
know,
You
know
what?
Jack
was
our
glue.
I
feel
like
the
fact
that
he's
gone
No,
it
makes
us
a
little
bit
just...
The
opposite
of
that.
You
like
to
party?
