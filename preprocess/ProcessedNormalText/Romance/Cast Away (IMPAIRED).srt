down
there.
Let
me
get
you
a
towel.
They're
sleeping.
If
you
come
in,
It's
a
nice
house.
Yeah,
we
got
What's
your
daughter's
name?
Katie.
Katie.
-
She's
a
beautiful
little
girl.
Just
let
me
get
We
have
a
pro
football
team
now,

Um,
yeah.
Oh,
my
God.
Okay.
First
they
were
the
Oilers,
The
Houston
Oilers
Yeah.
But
that's
not
all.
They
went
to
the
Super
Bowl
-
And
I
missed
that.
They
almost
won
by
one
yard.
I
got
whole
milk,
I
don't
have
any
half-and-half,
That'll
do
fine.
What
happened
to
you
You're
not
When
you,
um...
When
your
plane
went
down,
everything
just
sort
of
I
think
about
I
came
out
here
Oh,
my
God.
I'm
sorry
it
doesn't
work.
And
I,
uh,
It
was
all
faded
anyway.
I
want
you
to
have
it.
That's
a
family
heirloom,
That's
everything
I
have
They
said
they
never
figured
out
Probably
some
mislabeled
So
here's
where
You
drifted
about
500
miles.
This
is
where
about
600
miles
And
these
are
Ships
went
back
and
forth
I
never
should've
I
never
should've
I
wanna
show
you
something.
Come
here.
This
is...
You
kept
our
car.
All
right,
now,
It's
a
good
car.
Had
a
lot
of
memories
Two
very
nice
memories.
Oh,
that
trip
So,
can
I
drive
it?
It's
your
car.
That's
good,
'cause
my...
Um...
Let
me
get
some
stuff
You
think
you're
gonna
I
don't
know.
It's
kind
of
confusing
Well,
you
should.
I
mean,
really,
I
would.
So,
what
now?
I
don't
know.
I
really
don't
know.

You
said
I'm
so
sorry.
Me
too.
Chuck!
Chuck!
Chuck!
I
always
knew
you
were
alive.
I
knew
it.
But
everybody
said
that
I
had
to
let
you
go.
I
love
you.
You're
the
love
of
my
life.
I
love
you
too,
Kelly.
More
than
you'll
ever
know.
Chuck?
You
have
to
go
home.
We
both
had
done
Kelly
added
it
all
up.
She
knew
she
had
I
added
it
up,
I'd
lost
her.
'Cause
I
was
never
gonna
I
was
gonna
die
there,
totally
alone.
I
mean,
I
was
gonna
get
sick
or
The
only
choice
I
had,
the
only
thing
was
when
and
how...
and
where
So...
I
made
a
rope.
And
I
went
up
to
the
summit
But
I
had
to
test
it,
Of
course.
And
the
weight
of
the
log...
snapped
the
limb
So
l-l...
I
couldn't
even
kill
myself
I
had
power
over
nothing.
And
that's
when
this
feeling
I
knew...
somehow...
that
I
had
to
stay
alive.
Somehow.
I
had
to
keep
breathing,
even
though
there
was
And
all
my
logic
said
that
So
that's
what
I
did.
I
stayed
alive.
I
kept
breathing.
And
then
one
day
because
the
tide...
came
in,
And
now,
here
I
am.
I'm
back...
in
Memphis,
talking
to
you.
I
have
ice
in
my
glass.
And
I've
lost
her
I'm
so
sad
that
But
I'm
so
grateful
that
And
I
know
I
gotta
keep
breathing.
Because
tomorrow,
Who
knows
what
the
tide

-
You
look
lost.
Where
are
you
headed?
Well,
I
was
just
about
Well,
that's
83
South.
And
this
road
here

If
you

you

And

All

then.
Good
luck,
