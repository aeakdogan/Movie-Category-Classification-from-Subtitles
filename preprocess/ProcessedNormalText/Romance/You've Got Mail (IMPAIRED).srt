do

I
like
it...

or
because
I
haven't

much

You've

not.

shake
out.

Great.
Thank

Two
white
wine,
please.
I
cannot
believe
that
-
Joe
Fox?
-
As
in...
...he's
gonna
take
over
everything.
Fox?
Your
last
name
is
Fox.
F-O-X.
God!
I
didn't
realize...
I
didn't
know...
Who
you
were
with?

Excuse
me?

Sorry,
it's
from
The
Godfather.
It's
when
the
movie
producer
...is
an
emissary
of
vito
Corleone.
Just
before
the
horse's
head
...with
all
the
bloody
sheets.
Aah!
Aah!
Aahh!
Never
mind.
You
were
spying
on
me,
weren't
you?
Why
would
I
spy
on
you?
Because
I
am
your
competition,
...or
you
wouldn't
have
put
up
the
sign:
Our
store
entrance
is
around
the
corner.
It's
not
the
name
of
our
store.
And
you
do
not
own
the
phrase
KATHLEEN:
What
are
you
doing?
What
is
that?
What
are
you
doing?
You're
taking
all
the
caviar?
The
reason
I
came
into
your
store...
...is
because
I
was
spending
the
day
I
was
buying
them
presents.
I'm
the
type
of
guy
who
likes
to
buy
...who
are
his
relatives.
There
was
only
one
place
to
find
That
won't
always
be
the
case.
And
it
was
yours.
...a
charming
little
bookstore.
You
probably
sell,
what,
How
did
you
know
that?
I'm
in
the
book
business.
I
am
in
the
book
business.
JOE:
And
we
are
the
Price
Club.
Only
instead
of
a
10-gallon
vat
...that
won't
even
fit
under
your
Me,
a
spy?
Absolutely.
I
have
in
my
possession
the
secret
...of
a
bookstore
so
inconsequential,
...that
I
had
to
rush
over
for
fear
What?
What?
Hey.
How
you
doing?
Frank
Navasky.
Joe
Fox.
-
Joe
Fox?
The
inventor
of
the
superstore.
The
enemy
of
the
mid-list
novel.
The
destroyer
of
City
Books.
Tell
me
something,
really.
I
use
a
wonderful
Ultra-dorm.
Don't
take
the
whole
thing,
just
half.
You'll
wake
up
without
-
You're
Frank
Navasky,
aren't
you?
PATRICIA:
...about
Anthony
Powell
was
brilliant.
-
Really?
I'm
Patricia
Eden.
Hi.
Eden
Books.
Joe,
this
man
is
the
greatest
...on
Julius
and
Ethel
Rosenberg.
FRANK:
This
is
Kathleen
Kelly.
My
piece?
I
just...
You
write
these
things.
A
week
goes
by,
the
phone
"I'm
a
fraud.
You
know
what
fascinated
me
Is
how
old
they
looked,
You
know?
Oh,
wow,
I'm
so
happy
to
have
We
will
talk.
Have
you
ever
It's
crossed
my
mind,
...like
the
Luddite
movement
in
Call
me.
JOE:
Hon,
have
you
ever
had
I
had
no
idea
Frank
Navasky...
...was
going
to
be
so
down-to-earth.
You
read
his
stuff...
...you
think
he's
going
to
be
He's
always
talking
about
Heidegger...
...and
Foucault.
And
I
have
no
idea
what

JOE:


JOE:
Do
you
ever
feel
you've
become
That
a
Pandora's
box
of
...
your
arrogance,
your
spite...
...
your
condescension...
...
has
sprung
open?
Someone
provokes
you,
...
and
moving
on,
you
zing
them?
"Hello,
it's
Mr.
Nasty."
I'm
sure
you
have
no
idea
KATHLEEN:
No,
I
know
what
you
mean,
What
happens
to
me
when
I'm
provoked
Blank.
Then
I
spend
all
night
...
trying
to
figure
out
What
should
I
have
said,
Bottom-dweller...
...who
recently
belittled
Nothing.
Nothing.
Even
now.
Even
now...
Days
later...
I
can't
figure
it
out.
JOE:
Wouldn't
it
be
wonderful
if
I
could
Then
I'd
never
behave
badly
and
And
we'd
both
be
happy.
On
the
other
hand,
I
must
warn
you:
When
you
finally
have
the
pleasure
...
at
the
moment
you
mean
to
say
it,
Do
you
think
we
should
meet?
Meet?
Oh,
my
God...
Seventy-two
twenty-seven.
This
is
a
cash-only
line.
-
What?
Oh,
my
God.
I
just
have
a
credit
card.
MAN:
There's
a
sign.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
very
sorry.
I
never
do
this,
but
I'm
asking
you
to
MAN:
-
She
has
no
cash.
Get
on
another
line,
lady.
I
have
a
dollar.
I
have
a

One
dollar.
-
Is
there
anything
you
can
do?
-
Hello.
No,
I
do
not
need
any
money.
CASHIER:
-
Get
in
another
line.
Rose.
That
is
a
great
name.
Rose.
This
is
Kathleen.
And
I'm
Henry.
Henry,
how
are
you?
This
is
a
credit
card
machine.
Happy
Thanksgiving.
It's
your
turn
to
say
Happy
Thanksgiving
back.
Knock,
knock.
-
Who's
there?
Orange
who?
"Orange"
you
going
to
...by
zipping
this
credit
card
Come
on,
you
can
do
it.
There
you
go.
Rose?
That
is
a
great
name.
So
you're
fine.
Fine.
Happy
Thanksgiving.
I'm
so
sorry.
Really.
-
I
apologize
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart.
-
I'd
like
to
get
home
for
the
parade.


NELSON:
Wonderful!

I
got
it.
KATHLEEN:
It's
coming
on
Christmas
Do
you
know
that
Joni
Mitchell
song?
I
wish
I
had
a
river
Such
a
sad
song.
And
not
But
I
was
thinking
about
it
tonight
Unwrapping
funky
ornaments
...
and
missing
my
mother
so
much
I
always
miss
my
mother
at
Christmas.
But
somehow
it
is
worse
this
year
I
need
her
to
make
me
some
cocoa...
...
and
tell
me
that
everything
that's
JOE:
What
kind
of
advice
do
you
need?
KATHLEEN:
I
wish
you
could
help.
I
wish...

JOE:
I
had
a
gut
feeling
Hi.
I
can
give
you
advice.
Uh-oh.
KATHLEEN:
Hmm.
JOE:
Please
say
no.
No.
How
cute
is
that?
KATHLEEN:
Huh.
Well...
JOE:
It's
what
I
do
best.
What's
your
business?
No.
Mm-mm.
KATHLEEN:
Okay.
JOE:
Well,
minus
specifics,
...go
to
the
mattresses.
"Except
to
say
go
to
the
matt..."
What?
What
does
that
mean?
JOE:
It's
from
The
Godfather.
What
is
it
with
men
and
The
Godfather?
Hello?
Oh,
come
on.
Hello?
Well...

Michael...
JOE:
The
Godfather
The
Godfather
is
the
answer
What
should
I
pack
"Leave
the
gun.
Take
the
cannoli."
What
day
of
the
week
is
it?
"Monday,
Tuesday,
The
answer
to
your
question
is:
You're
at
war.
It's
not
personal.
Recite
that
to
yourself
every
time
I
know
you
worry
about
being
brave.
Don't.
This
is
your
chance.
Fight!
Fight
to
the
death!
Fight
to
the
death.
It's
not
personal.
Fight,
fight,
fight!

FRANK:
-
Hey.
I've
been
thinking.
-
Frank.
I've
decided
to
go
the
mattresses.
Do
you
think
it
would
be
a
conflict
of

Yes.
No.
So
you'll
do
it?
Yes.
Yes.
Do
you
know

it
is

GEORGE:
George
speaking,
may
I
help
you?
CHRISTINA:
Kathleen,
KATHLEEN:
CHRISTINA:
BIRDIE:
"So
you
do
not
have
to
look

evil

the
twentieth
century's
BOTH:
I
believe
that.
BIRDIE:
...and
you
will
save
your
soul."
Frank,
that's
charming.
Think
it's
a
little
over
the
top?
GEORGE:
That
was
The
Village
Voice.
Oh,
man.
Float
like
a
butterfly.

We
don't
want

Five,
six,
seven,
eight!
One,
two,
three,
four!
"We
don't
want
this
superstore."
-
Is
that
what
they're
saying?
-
Well,
who
wrote
that?
Pissing
me
off,
actually.
KATHLEEN:

become

big,

met
her?
Boy,

Probably

as
fine
Oh,
no,
no.
She's
beautiful.
KEVIN:
...about
sending
her

back
Broke,
single,
white
lady.
It's
not

-
It's

Hey,
here's
a
good-looking
guy!
I
sell
cheap
books.
REPORTER:
And
that,
in
a
nutshell,
That's
what
you
said?
REPORTER:
That's
not
all
I
said.
I
can't
believe
those
bastards.
I
said
you
could
read
for
hours
I
said
we
had
150,000
titles.
I
showed
I
said
we
were
a
goddamn
piazza.
A
place
in
this
city
where
Piazza?
I
was
eloquent!
-
Shit!
It's
inevitable.
People
want
And
you
into
Attila
the
Hun.
Not
me
personally,
I
have
met
Joe
Fox.
I've
heard
him
compare

and
the
books
in
it
The
bookstore,
tell
us
about
it.
The
Shop
Around
the
Corner
has

that
the
city
needs
in
order
SIDNEY-ANN:
That
was
nice.
Thank
you.
-
Are
you
taping
this?
Technologically
speaking,
Take
the
VCR.
The
whole
idea
behind
the
VCR
...
for
you
to
tape
what's
on
TV
The
whole
idea
...
is
so
you
can
miss
-
I've
heard
you
say
that
before.
SIDNEY-ANN:
Right.
FRANK:
Radio.
There's
a
medium
You
gonna
start
collecting
radios
now?
SIDNEY-ANN:
-
You're
good
at
it.
KATHLEEN:
She's
coming
on
to
you.
They
do
this
on
television.
FRANK:
...
it's
a
true
New
York
treasure.
As
are
you.

Honestly,
I'd
love
to
have
you
back.
KATHLEEN:
She's
touching
herself.
Anytime.
We
can
turn
it
off.
Oh,
my
God.
I
just
want
to
say
that
Oh,
my
God.
No.
I
was
being
polite.
-
Thank
you,
Frank
Navasky.
"Thank
you're"?
Thank
you're?
Thank
you're,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
I
slobbered
all
over
her,
didn't
I?
But
I
think
that
GEORGE:
So
first,
I
gotta
go
get
...because
it
makes
Then
I'm
going
to
the
market,
...sausage
for
the
meat
sauce,
Spare
us.
GEORGE:
Because
this
is
a
big
date.

Don't
tell
me.
How
can
that
be?
All
this
publicity
Birdie,
what
am
I
going
to
do?
What
would
Mom
have
done?
Well,
let's
ask
her.
Cecilia,
what
should
we
do?
-
Birdie?
She
has
no
idea.
But
she
thinks
-
Good
night,
dearie.
KATHLEEN:
Do
you
still
want
to
meet
me?
JOE:
I
would
love
to
meet
you.
So
I
suppose
she's
carrying
a
copy
Not
really?
She
could
be
a
real
dog,
man.
I'm
only
staying
10
minutes.
I'll
say
hello,
have
a
cup
Hope
she
doesn't
have
a
squeaky
voice
Why
am
I
doing
this?
Relax.
You're
just
taking
it
I
always
do
that.
I
always
take
a
relationship
If
that
works
out,
I
take
it
Till
I
reach
that
level
where
...for
me
to
leave.
Huh.
I
won't
stay
that
long
anyway.
-
Yes,
you
did.
JOE:
Eight
o'clock.
Kevin...
...this
woman
is
the
most
adorable
If
she
turns
out
even
to
be
...I'd
be
crazy
not
to
turn
my
life
She
could
be
a
real
dog.
But
good
luck.
Would
you
go
and
look
for
me?
Go
look
through
the
window
All
right.
-
You're
pathetic,
man.
KEVIN:
You
see
her?
Oh,
wait,
yeah.
I
see
a
very
beautiful
girl.
She's
fine.
She's
fine.
-
I
knew
it.
I
knew
she
would
be.
But
no
book.

All
right.
Okay,
wait.
There's
a
book
with
a
flower.
What
does
she
look
like?
Can't
see.
Waiter's
blocking.
Damn
it!
Hold
on,
he's
moving.
-
Yeah?
JOE:
Can
you
see
her?
Yeah.
And?
She's
very
pretty.
She
is!
I
knew
she
would
be!
She
had
to
be!
You
know
what?
She
look...
I
mean,
she
almost
has
...that
Kathleen
Kelly
person.
Why
not?
You
thought
Absolutely.
Why
not?
Well,
if
you
don't
like
...I
can
tell
you
right
now...
...you
ain't
gonna
like
this
girl.
Why
not?
Because
it
is
Kathleen
Kelly.
What
are
you
going
to
do?
Nothing.
You
just
gonna
let
her
That's
exactly
what
I'm
going
to
do.
Good
night.
Do
you
mind
if
I
borrow
this
chair?
Yes,
I
mind.
Sorry.
I'm
expecting
someone.
Would
you
like
another
tea?
Yes.
Thank
you.

JOE:
Hello.
This
is
a
coincidence.
Yes,
I
would,
actually.
Pride
and
Prejudice.
Do
you
mind?
I
bet
you
read
that
book
every
year.
...Mr.
Darcy.
Your
sentimental
heart
beats
wildly
...whatever
her
name
is
are
truly,
WAITER:
-
Can
I
get
you
something?
Mochaccino
decaf,
nonfat.
You
are
not
staying.
I'll
just
stay
here
until
Gee,
is
he
late?
The
heroine
of
Pride
and
Prejudice
She
is
a
great
and
complex
character.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I've
read
it.
Oh,
well,
good
for
you.
You'd
discover
a
lot
I
know
what
I'd
find.
Instead
of
a
brain,
a
cash
register.
What?
-
I
just
had
a
breakthrough.
For
the
first
time,
when
confronted
...I
knew
exactly
what
I
You
have
a
gift
for
it.
That
was
a
Meanness?
Don't
misunderstand
me.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Is
this
a
red
rose?
Something
you
read
about
in
a
book.
It's
funny
to
you,
isn't
it?

Please
leave.
Please
leave,
I
beg
you.
Thank
you.

That
hanky
reminds
me
First
day
you
lied
to
me.
-
I
didn't
lie
to
you.
-
No,
I
didn't.
-
I
did
not.
-
I
did
not.
I
thought
that
Fox
stuff
I
didn't
lie
about
it.
-
Joe?
"Just
call
me
Joe."
As
if
you
were
a
stupid
"Hi,
I'm
Kimberly."
Don't
they
know
you're
It's
like
an
entire
Look.
-
I
am
not
a
22-year-old
cocktail
waitress.
When
I
said
the
thing
about
...that's
not
what
I
meant.
You
poor,
sad
multimillionaire.

I'll
take
a
wild
guess
So
who
is
he,
I
wonder?
Certainly
not
...on
Julius
and
Ethel
Rosenberg.
But
somebody
else
entirely
different.
Will
you
be
mean
to
him
too?
No,
I
will
not.
The
man
who
is
coming
here
The
man
who
is
coming
here
He's
got
a
wonderful
sense
of
humor.
But...
...he's
not
here.
If
he's
not,
he
has
a
reason...
...because
there
is
not
a
cruel
I
wouldn't
expect
you
to
understand
You
with
your
theme
park,
multi-level,
You've
deluded
yourself
that
you're
a
But
no
one
will
ever
And
maybe
no
one
will
remember
me.
But
plenty
of
people
They
think
she
was
fine.
They
think
her
store
You
are
nothing
but
a
suit.
That's
my
cue.
Good
night.

PATRICIA:
So
then
the
agent
asks
"If
you
think
I'm
even
...about
paying
that
kind
...whose
last
book
is
being
used
...you
are
completely
crazy."
She
was
insulting
and
provocative
...was
the
way
her
hair
Underneath
that
disagreeable
JOE:
Let's
not
talk
about
it.
I'm
going
back
to
the
office
Not
really.
This
place
is
a
well-oiled
So?
What
happened?
-
He
never
came.
KATHLEEN:
I
think
something
happened.
Something
unexpected
that
What
if
he
showed
up,
Not
possible.
Maybe
there
was
a
subway
accident.
Absolutely.
A
train
got
trapped
underground
And
no
phone.
KATHLEEN:
And
you
know
how
those
He
got
sucked

the
tracks.
The

rail.
CHRISTINA:
What
happened?
He
was
unable
to
make
it.
He
stood
you
up?
Maybe
he
had
a
car
accident.
They
hit
something
and
you
slam
Or
his
elbows
could
be
in
Or
he
could
be
unconscious.
In
a
coma.
Stuck
in
intensive
care.
With
a
heart
monitor
beeping.
And
like...
-
No
phone.
What?
What
are
you
saying?
It
could
be.
He
was
arrested
Is
there
a
picture?
So
that
explains
it.
He
was
in
jail.
And
there
was
a
phone.
He
only
got
one
call,
You
are
so
lucky.
You
could
be
dead.
He
couldn't
be
the
Rooftop
Killer.
Remember
when
you
thought
Well...
That
was
different.
How
long
did
you
sit
there
all
alone?
-
Not
long.
Joe
Fox
came
in.
I
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
There's
got
to
be
something
to
do.
GEORGE:
Look
at
this.

KATHLEEN:
Last
night
I
went
to
meet
you,
I
wish
I
knew
why.
And
as
I
waited,
A
man
who
has
made
And
an
amazing
thing
happened.
I
was
able,
for
the
first
time...
...
to
say
the
exact
thing
...
at
the
exact
moment
And
of
course,
...
just
as
you
said
I
would.
I
was
cruel,
and
I'm
never
cruel.
Though
I
hardly
believe
To
him,
I
am
just
a
bug
to
be
crushed.
But
what
if
it
did?
No
matter
what
he's
done
to
me,
Anyway...
...
I
so
wanted
to
talk
to
you.
I
hope
you
have
a
good
reason
You
don't
seem
like
the
kind
of
The
odd
thing
about
this
...
is
that
you're
more
likely
to
talk
But
I
just
want
to
say...
...
that
all
this
nothing
has
meant
...
somethings.
So
thanks.

I
was
stuck
in
a
meeting
...
and...
...
the
electricity
went
out.
And...
...
we
were
trapped...
...
on
the
38th
floor.
And
the
telephone
system
blew
too.
Amazingly
enough.
Dear
friend:
I
cannot
tell
you
But
I
beg
you
...
to
forgive
me
for
not
being
there.
For
what
happened.
I
feel
terrible
that
you
...
that
caused
you
additional
pain.
But
I'm
absolutely
sure...
...
that
whatever
you
said
Even
deserved.
Everyone
says
things
they
regret
You
were
expecting
to
see
...
and
met
the
enemy
instead.
The
fault
is
mine.
Someday
I'll
explain
everything.
Meanwhile...
...
I'm
still
here.
Talk
to
me.
Did
he
say
anything
about

not
really.
Listen,
it
doesn't

We'll
just

Thank
you
for
the

you
fell
madly
in

So,

We're
going

Close.

You
are
such
a
liar.
You
are
daring
to
imagine
that
I
know
it
doesn't
feel
like
that.
But
you're
not.
You
are

Not
nothing.

you

more,
ask
me.

fell
madly
in

with.
But
I'm
not
going
to
tell.
Who
was
it,
Birdie?
Come
on,
tell.
Uch.
That's
so
mean.
But
so
romantic.
BIRDIE:

It
wasn't
meant
to
be.
He
ran

Spain?
The
country,
he
ran
it.
And
then
he
died.
Just
as
well.

say
that.
Who
else
could
it
have
been?

you

It's
not
like
he
was
something
normal,
It
happened
in

stupid
things
They
buy

they

I

In

went
to

I

you.
You

Excuse

I'm
sorry.
Excuse
me.
This

No,
it's
not

I

What
was
terrible?
Jumping
all
over

I
don't

how

this.
What
is
it?
What?
You're
a
wonderful
person.
So
are
you.
And
I'm
so
honored
that

you
wouldn't

Don't

You

No.

we're

Oh.

I

I

home
tonight
and
got
into
An
hour
later,
...
and
Brinkley
and
I
moved
out.
Suddenly
everything
had
become
clear.
It's
a
long
story...
...
full
of
the
personal
details
Let
me
just
say...
...
there
was
a
man
sitting
...
who
knew
exactly
what
he
wanted.
And
I
found
myself
wishing
KATHLEEN:
People
are
always
telling
you
But
all
they're
saying
is
that
something
...
has
happened.
My
store
is
closing
this
week.
I
own
a
store.
It's
a
lovely
store.
In
a
week
it
will
be
...
like
a
Baby
Gap.
Soon
we'll
just
be
a
memory.
In
fact,
some
foolish
person
will
The
way
it
keeps
changing
on
you,
I
know
because
that's
But
the
truth
is...
...
I'm
heartbroken.
I
feel
as
if
a
part
of
me
has
died...
...
and
my
mother
has
died

And
no
one
can
ever
make
it
right.


JOE:
Oh,
hell.
How
are
you?
JOE:
You
know,
Dad,
you
did
pretty
well.
Welcome
aboard.
-
It
lasted
a
while.
NELSON:
...I've
stayed
on
this
boat
after...
Let's
see.
Your
mother.
Laurette,
the
ballet
dancer.
My
nanny.
She
was
the
nanny?
Yeah.
I
forgot
that.
How
ironic.
Then
there
was
the
ice
skater.
-
Also
my
nanny.
Yeah.
That's
amazingly
ironic.
And
then
there
was
Sybil,
the,
um...
-
It's
an
"A"
word.
Exactly.
Whose
moon
turned
out
to
be
Just
like
Gillian.
-
Gillian
ran
off
with
someone?
-
Nanny
Maureen?

Gillian
ran
off
with
Nanny
Maureen.
You
got
it.
JOE:
-
That's
true.
Well,
who's
better
than
us?
Father
and
son,
together
at
last.
Who
did
you
say
you
broke
up
with?
Patricia.
You
met
her.
Would
I
like
her?
Just
kidding,
son.
Now,
is
this
beautiful
or
what?
Of
course,
I'll
be
living
out
of
And
then
there's
More
of
your
inheritance
-
Don't
worry
about
it.
I
just
have
to
meet
someone
new.
Right,
yeah.
A
snap
to
find
the
one
person
in
the
NELSON:
Have
I
ever
been
with
anybody
Have
you?
KATHLEEN
:
It's
Joe
Fox.
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
Uh,
may
I
please
come
up?
No,
I
don't
really
think
that
...
I
have
a...
I
have
a
terrible...
...cold.

-
Can
you
hear
that?
I'm
sniffling,
I'm
taking
echinacea
and
vitamin
C
...24
hours
a
day.
And
I
think
I'm
contagious.
I
would
really
appreciate
it

Kathleen?
Uh...

Uh,
just
a
second!
Yes,
just
a
second.
-
Hello.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
heard
you
were
sick.
And
I
was
worried.
And
I
wanted
to
make
sure...
What?
-
Is
there
somebody
here?
Oh.
It's
the
Home
Shopping
Network.
You
buy
any
of
those
I
was
thinking
about
it.
-
You
put
me
out
of
business.
-
Did
you
come
to
gloat?
-
To
offer
me
a
job?
I
have
plenty
of
offers.
-
By
my
former...
We
broke
up.
That's
too
bad.
Oh.
I
don't
mean
to
say
things
like
that.
...there's
no
excuse
Every
time
I
see
you...
Things
like
that
just
I
brought
you
flowers.
Ohh.
Thank
you.
Why
don't
I
just
put
these
You're
sick.
I
need
a
vase.
Above
the
refrigerator.
JOE:
George
says
hello,
by
the
way.
He
told
me
you
were
sick.
How
is
George?
Great,
really
great.
He's
revolutionizing
the
place.
You
can't
work
in
his
department...
...unless
you
have
a
Ph.D.
I
love
daisies.
-
You
told
me.
Don't
you
think
daisies
I
do.
When
did
you
break
up?
Couple
of
weeks
ago.
Everyone
is
breaking
up.
This
other
person
I
know
broke
up
Or
after
it,
or
just
outside
it
or...
It
got
stuck.
When
I
saw
you
at
the
coffee
place,
And
I
was...
Charming.
I
was
not
charming.
JOE:
Yes.
I
was...
I
was
upset
and
horrible.
JOE:
-
Honey?
I
was
the
horrible
one.
Well,
that's
true.
But
I
have
no
excuse.
Oh,
I
see
what
you're
saying.
That's
interesting.
Whereas
I
am
a
horrible
person...
...therefore
I
have
no
choice
That's
what
you're
saying.
I
put
you
out
of
business
so...
...you're
entitled
to
hate
me.
I
don't
hate
you.
But
you'll
never
forgive
me.
-
Just
like
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth
Bennet
in
She
was
too
proud.
I
thought
you
hated
Or
was
she
too
prejudiced...
...and
Mr.
Darcy
is
too
proud?
I
can't
remember.
It
wasn't
personal.
What
is
that
supposed
to
mean?
All
that
means
is
that
But
it
was
personal
to
me.
It's
personal
to
a
lot
of
people.
What
is
so
wrong
Nothing.
Whatever
else
anything
is,
My
head
is
starting
to
get
fuzzy.
Why
did
you
stop
by
again?
I
wanted
to
be
your
friend.
Oh.
I
knew
it
wasn't
possible.
Sometimes
a
guy
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?
What?
What
happened
with
that
guy
Nothing.
But
you're
crazy
about
him?
Yes,
I
am.
Why
don't
you
run
off
with
him?
I
don't
actually
know
him.
Really?
I
only
know
him
through...
You
won't
believe
this.
JOE:
Through
the
Internet?
Yes.
JOE:
"You've
got
mail."
Yes.
Those
are
very
powerful
words.
Yes.
I'm
happy
for
him.
Although...
Could
I
just
make
a
suggestion?
What?
I
think...
...you
should
meet
him.
No,
wait,
I
take
that
back.
Why
would
you
meet
I
hardly
think
I
need
to
take
I
can
see
I
bring
out
Let
me
help
you
...you'll
torture
yourself
about
I
hope
you
feel
better
soon.
It'd
be
a
shame
to
miss
Thank
you
for
the
daisies.
Well,
you
take
care.
I
will.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
KATHLEEN:
...
and
I
think
we
should
meet.
JOE:
And
we
will
meet.
But
I'm
in
the
middle
...
tweaking.
Some
tweaking?
A
project
that
needed...
..."tweaking."
-
Yeah,
that's
what
he
said.
It
sounds
to
me
like
he's
married.
Three
kids.
That's
a
terrible
thing
to
say.
How
do
you
know?
Have
you
said,
"Are
you
married?"
No,
I'm
not
going
to...
No.
KATHLEEN:
I
know
this
is
a
little
late
...
are
you
married?
JOE:
What
kind
of
question
is
that?
How
can
you
ask
me
that?
Oh,
wait,
I
get
it.
Your
friends
are
saying
the
reason
Am
I
right?
-
So
he
didn't
answer
the
question.
-
He
did
not.
He
knew
what
I
was
after
which
is,
He
did
not
answer
No.
Maybe
he's
fat.
He's
fat.
He's
a
fatty.
I
don't
care.
You
don't
care
that
he's
so
fat...
...he
has
to
be
removed
from
his
house
KATHLEEN:
That
is
completely
ridiculous.
What's
his
handle?
Uh...
I'm
not
going
to
write
him.
You
think
I'm
going
to
e-mail
him?
All
right,
N-Y-1-5-2.
N-Y-1-5-2?
152.
He's
152
years
old.
He's
had
152
moles
removed...
...so
now
he's
got
on
his
face.
The
number
of
people
who
think
152
people
who
think

KATHLEEN:
-
Why'd
I
even
tell
you?
The
number
of
his
souvenir
...that
he's
collected
His
address.
No,
he
would
never
do
The
only
thing
I
...aside
from
the
married
thing
...is
the
boat
thing.
What
boat
thing?
I
could
never
be
I
have
a
boat.
Oh.
Which
clinches
it.
-
How
many?
-
Allow
me.
I
could
never
be
with
It's
cloud's
illusions
I
recall
What
does
that
mean?
It
must
be
a
metaphor,
JOE:
KATHLEEN:
There's
this
She's
excited
to
read
it
Who
would
ever
have
thought
-
If
I
hadn't
had
all
this
time...
-
You
know
what?
The
truth
is
he
was
the
one
who
Mr.

Oh.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Oh.
No

with

keep
on
bumping
into
you.
Hope
your
mango's
ripe.
I
think
it
is.
You
want
to
bump
into
me...
...on
Saturday
around
lunchtime?
-
Yeah.
-
Uh-huh.
JOE:
...
Saturday?
Four
o'clock.
There's
a
place
in
Riverside
Park
...
where
the
path
curves
Brinkley
and
I
will
be
waiting.
Okay,
let's
do
it.
Ready?
And...
Doot.
There
it
goes.
-
Today?
Wow.
I
know.
In
Riverside
Park.
That
would
mean
he's
a
Westsider.
Maybe
I've
seen
him
JOE:
You
could
have
seen
him
KATHLEEN:
-
He
could
be
anyone.
And
those
flowers
are
for
you.
JOE:
-
Could
be
the
Zipper
Man.
The
Zipper
Man.
Who
is
that?
He
repairs
zippers
-
Will
you
cut
it
out?

The
timing
here
is
everything.
See?
Until
you
are
absolutely
convinced
...that
you
could
possibly
love.
Yes.
You
know,
sometimes
I
wonder.
What?
If
I
hadn't
been
Fox
Books...
...and
you
hadn't
been
...and
you
and
I
had
just
met.
-
I
know.
I'd
have
asked
for
your
number.
I
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
wait
"How
about
some
coffee...
...or
drinks
or
dinner...
...or
a
movie...
...for
as
long
as
Joe...
You
and
I
would
never
The
only
thing
we'd
fight
about
would
be
Who
fights
about
that?
Some
people.
Not
us.
We
would
never.
If
only.
-
I
gotta
go.
How
can
you
forgive
this
guy
...and
not
forgive
me
...of
putting
you
out
of
business?
How
I
wish
you
would.
I
really
have
to
go.
You
don't
want
to
be
late.

JOE:

Brinkley!

Don't
cry,
Shopgirl.
Don't
cry.
I
wanted
it
to
be
you.
I
wanted
it
to
be
you
so
badly.
