I
thought
you
were
leaving.
You
are
so
annoying.

I
went
down

Can
you
show
me?
-
Teach
me
to
ride

a
man.
And
spit

a

They
didn't
teach
you
that

No.
Let's
do
it.
Jack
,

no!
Jack
,

no!
Wait
,

Jack.
No

Jack.
Watch
closely.

That's
disgusting!
That
was
pitiful!
Come

See
the
range
on
that
thing?

-That
was
better.
You
got

on
it.

I
introduce
Jack
