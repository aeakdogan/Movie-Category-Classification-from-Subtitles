Days,
months,
The

seems
so
dull..
..That
Amlie
prefers
to
dream
her
life
5
years
later,
Amlie
is

is
Gina,
Amlie's
colleague,
She
likes

you
can
see
her

he
likes
This
is

He
spies
on

The
only
thing
he
likes..
..is

And
finally,
there's
Philomne,
Amlie
looks
after
her
cat

sound
of
the
bowl
with
water
on
the
floor.
..he
likes
to

thanks,
ma'am,
-Amlie
often
goes
to
see
her
father,
-Why
don't
you
enjoy
your
retirement,
and...
-Travel,
-When
we
were
young,
..we'd
have
liked
to
travel,
Because
of
your
heart.
-And
now,...
-Sometimes,
Amlie
goes
to
the
movies.
-I
like
to

dark
And
I
also
like
to

I
don't
like

-Amlie
doesn't
have
a

She
tried,
but
it
didn't
On
the
other

she
enjoys
..putting
her

And
play
at

All
his

A

shake
is
enough
..so
he
never
goes
out.
Time
hasn't
changed
anything.
Amlie
still
..and
asks
herself
silly
questions
For
example,
how
many
couples
are
-Fifteen...
-And
finally,
the
night
of

-Excuse
me.
Did
a

boy
use
to
live
-Come

-No,
thanks.
Oh,

At
first,
they're
cute,
and
then
I
know.
-Since
64.
People
must

told
you.
-No.
Sit
down.
My
husband
used
to

he
likes
a

done.
-Come

Look
at

I
have
to

-This
young
man
who
rummages
..is
called
Nino
Quincampoix.
Amlie
was
denied
the
company
..but
little
Nino,
Often,
at
the
same
moment,
..one
was
dreaming
about
a
sister
..with
whom
they'd
play
-Hello,
dad.
Made
yourself
a
new
friend?
-No,
I've
had
it
for
ages.
But
since
your
mother
..I
had
put
it
away
in
the
shed.
There!
Not
bad,
eh?
-Say,
dad.
If
you
found

make
you
happy,

gonna
make
tea.
-Don't
move.
-You're
OK?
Better?
-Hey,

the
door

of

insists?
There's
other

-Goodbye.
-Yes

-Is
there
bchamel
sauce,
-Of
course,
why?
-Bchamel
sauce
Just
like
horse-meat
for
you.
-That's
got
nothing
to
do
I'd
rather
eat
-Come

Like
"toto".
I
really
like
this
painting.
-It's
"The
rower's
lunch".
By
Renoir.
I
paint
one
every
year,
The
hardest
is
the
eyes.
Sometimes,
they
change
..when
I'm
not
looking.
-They
look
happy
here.

a
gift
from
my
sister-in-law.
Oh,
I
just
put
it
there,
this
way..
..no
need
to
wind
up
After
all
these
years,..
..the
only
character
I
..is
the
girl
with
the
glass
of
water.
..and
yet,
outside.
-Maybe
she's
just

different?

don't

No,
Bretodeau
won't
