Hey,
you
want
to
get
out
of
here?
-What
a
rager,
huh?
Isn't
it
weird
that
all
this,
this
all
happened
You
and
me.
James...
I
don't
think
I
can
see
you
anymore.
You
don't...
What
do
you
mean?
Sorry.
Women
are
mercurial,
man.
-And
you
did
just
start
dating
last
week.
You
didn't
tell
her
about
the
Scarlet
V,
-That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
-What?
Look,
I
don't
lie
to
people
Yes,
but
you
could've
just
left
it
You
don't
want
"virgin"

You

who
throws
herself
at
you
Look,
I
know
most
people
I
guess
I'm...
I'm
different.
Well,
you
know
what,
-When
we're
on
the
Continent.
Yes!
Focus
on
Europe.
It's
going
to
be
To
the
graduate.
Yeah,
so
I
researched
and
the
median
cost
about
$7.68
more,
multiplied
by
the
42
days
is
$322.56.
Bill,
do
you
want
to
take
this?
Excuse
me,
can
you
get
me
So
with
the
$368
plus
the
$900
you
guys
I
do
need
an
additional
$279.11.
James,
we
didn't
want
but
your
father
has
been
transferred
Really?
Is
that...
Is
that
bad?
Yes,
we're
making
less,
Because
this
trip
Sweetie,
I
am
so
sorry
about
this
trip,
You
could
still
help
me
All
right,
James,
-Here
you
go,
sir.
Listen,
here's
to
you,
kiddo.
Wait.
What
am
I
going
to
do
You
know,
Well,
if
you
end
up
deciding
then
obviously
A
summer
job?
Summer
in
Pittsburgh.
-That's
fucking
harsh.
They
don't
like
people
like
me
You
know,
we're
romantics.
Hey,
yeah,
well,
you
know
what,
You
know,
with
my
dad's
connections,
And,
hey,
-Yeah?
-Thank
you
so
much,
Eric.
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
What,
them?
They're
clueless.
Fuck,
this
is
good
weed.
Speaking
of
which,
that
you'll
be
with
me
in
spirit
-Hey,
put
that
away.
-No.
-Take
it!
Look,
James,
But
look
at
it
this
way,
in
a
few
short
months,
in
New
York
City,
Like
we
always
talked
about,
man.
Quit
worrying,
Brennan.
Bill,
for
God's
sakes,
pay
attention.
All
right,
I'm
just
trying
to
drive.

Just
look
and
see
I
really
haven't
had
that
many
jobs,
but
here
are
my
academic
records
I
wrote
for
The
Gordian
Knot,
And
in
math,
I
got
770
on
the
SATs,
so
I
assume
I'd
be
good
These
are
the
only
jobs
No,
no,
I
also
spent
several
years
taking
care
of
a
neighbor's
lawn,
I
have
their
All
right.
Fill
this
out.
Okay.
No,
I've
never
actually
but
I
did
once
drive
my
friend's
van
on
a
pretty
lengthy
road
trip.
Yeah,
so...
Okay,
is
there
any
way
They
hung
up.
What
am
I
supposed
to
do?
The
only
place
I
know
I
can
get
a
job
What,
at
Adventureland?
You
got
a
concussion
on

-Brennan,
come
here.
There's

-Yes!
Oh,
Brennan!
Right
here,
sir!
Right
here,
sir!
I
don't
have
much
work
experience,
I'm
sorry.
Paulette?
Come
in,
Paulette?
Bobby?
Bobby?
-Paulette,
come
in,
Paulette?
-You
just...
You
gotta
press
it.
Okay.
This
is
James,
Games!
Oh,
great,
good.
Actually,
Bobby,
I'd
prefer
a
rides
job,
You
look
more
like
a
games
guy,
plus
I've
already
got
out
Okay.
Yeah,
no.
I
just...
My
name
is
Bobby.
Okay,
rules.
No
freebies,
-no
free
upgrades,
no
free
food.
Everybody
has
to
pay
for
everything.
And
more
importantly,
no
one
ever
wins
a
giant-ass
panda.
Yeah,
we
don't
have
that
many
left.
Cool?
Can
you
hand
me
Here,
I
have
a
resume.
I
don't
know
James?
Am
I
pronouncing
that
right?
-James?
James?
Okay,
by
accepting
this
T-shirt,
Hired!
Well,
usually
I...
-More
of
a
ceremonial
thing,
the
T-shirt.
Okay,
new
guy,
let's
get
this
over
with.
Here
we
are
This
one
is
inexplicably
Even
more
inexplicable
Hey,
Jerry.
$1
buys
5
rings.
If
one
of
the
rings
lands
they
win
a
giant-ass
panda.
-That
is
a
giant-ass
panda.
And
that's
because
this
game
Observe.
I'll
drop
a
ring
So
nobody
ever
wins?
If
someone
wins
a
giant-ass
panda
you
should
just
go
home
So
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
knock
the
hat
off
the
dummy
except,
as
you'll
see,
-Really?
I
mean,
we
pay
little
Malaysian
kids
we
can't
just
give
them
away.
You
get
a
5-minute
bathroom
break
I
recommend
saving
a
few
of
those
up
Brennan,
they
got
you
working
on
games?
What
a
pussy!
You're
such
a
pussy!
-You
know
that
demented
person?
Then
I
turned
4.
So
if
you
stand
you
will
see
that
it's
been
hammered
But
from
back
there,
Jesus,
that's
so
wrong.
A
criminal
abuse
Yeah,
well,
Yeah,
yeah,
Trotsky,
So
your
life
must
be
utter
shit,
I
was
supposed
to
go
to
Europe,
but
my
family
has
money
problems.
Wait
till
your
parents
start
My
dad
even
makes
me
pay
utilities.
I
don't
want...

I

things
don't
really

You

You
think

Yeah,
I

Maybe
I'm

You're

okay.
Have

Have
you

question.
Look,

Kentucky
Derby.
The
way
they
announce
it
on
the
radio,
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
-That's
an
auction,
sweetie.
So
don't...
Make
it
a
show.
Make
it
a
performance.
That's
what
people
come
for.
So,
let's
take
it
to
a
10.
Thank
you.
-Take
it
to
a

I
like
that.
Ladies

Congratulations,

up...

I
heard
Danny's
back
in
town.
Or
Pat?
And
tell
them
I
work
as
a
carny?
-Yo!
Guy!
-Give
me

Hey,
I
heard

big
fat
lady
Oh,

I
didn't
hear
about
that.
I
don't
know.
-Okay.
Yeah,
I
heard
she
was

Check

Okay,
sir,
actually,
That's
cheating.
Oh,

He
won
fair-and-square,
sir.
-Yeah,
I
saw
him
throw
it!
-Guys,
hey,
fellas,
I
could
lose
my
job.
Why
don't
you
give

kid
Here

here's
your
panda.
Yeah,
thanks.
Here

Dom.
Look,
am
I
gonna

in
trouble?
No
one's
ever
supposed
Is
it
worth
getting
knifed
over?
No.
-Hi.
I'm
James
Brennan.
I
just
started.
Sucks
you're
gonna
lose
your
job
No.
Shit.
I
need
this
job.
I'm
kidding.
You're
okay.
I'll
tell
Bobby
you
lost
the
panda
Yo,
Connell!
Rock
on!
-Who's
that?
Hey,
Joel,
is
that
a
pipe?
Yeah,
I
know.
It's
a
revolting
affectation,
-Hey,
Joel.
Hey.
You
guys
want
some
of
this?
-I
bagged
it
from
Paulette.
Cuban
rum?
I
think
somebody
was
trying
but
they
spelled
it
"Satin
Lives."
One
of
those
textile-worshipping
cults,
-That's
quite
funny.
Lou
Reed?
I
like
the
tee,
Em.
You
know
No,
I
don't
know
about
them.
Time
out,
guys.
-Guys,
he
doesn't
know
the
legend.
-Tell
him.
-Really?
-The
Lou
Reed.
Yeah,
he's
got
his
own
band.
-He's
gotta
get
a
lot
of
pussy
with
it.
Nice
pipe,
Grandpa!
Oh,
my
God.
I'm
sorry,
Joel.
Looks
like
it's
us!
"Panty
stain,"
that's
me.
Hey,
I
could
give
you
a
ride,
Really?
Frigo,
I
got
a
ride.
Really?
-What?
-Thank
you
so
much.
I
got
a
ride.
You
can
go.
Good
night.
-You
got
a
ride?
All
right,
then.
-Oh,
my
God.
-All
right,
I'll
see
you,
Brennan.
It's
just
my
life.

I'm
curious
to
know
##
##
I
keep
my
distance
##
##
It
reassures
me
just
to
know
##
##
But
I
don't
want
you
to
go
on
##
##
And
I
don't
want
to
know

-Here,
have
some
rum.
Oh,
shit.
Yeah,
she
used
to
read
my
journals.
I
took
Italian
for
a
year.
Okay,
she's
gone.
So,
Joel
told
me
that
you're
gonna
go
-Yeah.
Oh,
really?
Oh,
that's
cool.
Maybe
I'll
run
into
you
-What
are
you
studying?
Yeah,
I
want
to
be,
like,
But
I
want
to
report
You
know,
like
Charles
Dickens,
for
example,
wrote
but
he
visited
prisons
-That's
cool.
-Yeah.
No,
it
is,
it's...
But
why
do
you
have
to
No,
that's
a
valid
question,
but,
actually,
journalism
is
kind
of
You
need
the
right
connections.
Stupid.
I
think
my
mother
would
rather
or
something
like
that.
-Fuck
that,
right?
Yeah.
I
got
to
go.
I
have
to
meet
a
friend.
-Okay.
Yeah,
thanks
for
the
ride.
Hey,
I
heard
you
jammed
-Don't
believe
everything
you
hear.
I'll
tell
you
about
it
sometime.
So,
where
does
your
band
play?
Usual
shitholes
around
town.
-I'm
starting
a
new
band
out
in
LA.
Yeah.
It's
going
to
be
cool.
-Jesus.
You'll
get
better
at
avoiding
that.
Hey,
guys.
Party
at
my
house
tonight.
I'm
invited?
Yep,
that's
why
I'm
telling
you.
-Connell?
She's
cool,
right?
You're
just
smearing
that
around.
Hey,
Sue,
I'm
a
virgin
at
table
games,
We're
having
a
ping-pong
tournament!
-Hey.
Nice
digs.
Kind
of
begs
the
question
of
why
the
Well,
you
know,
my
dad's
a
lawyer.
It's
been
his
life-long
dream
for
-High
hopes.
So
we
can
drink
your
parents'
booze.
-Absolutely.
-Awesome.
Hey,
I
actually
brought
something
-What
is
that?
-Oh.
Bobby
is
weird.
I
had
to
go
back
and
get
the
extra
and
I
went
back,
I
opened
the
door,
and
there
were
all
these
pictures
What
a
weirdo.
Hey,
I'm
gonna
go
for
a
swim.
Okay.
Come
on.
Is
anybody
else
coming
in
here,
Yeah,
okay.
-See,
it's
not
so
bad.
It's
okay.
-Do
you
have
any
more
of
that
pot?
-We
should
make
pot
cookies.
That
would
be
so
fun.
-I
have
not.
I've
had
cookies.
My
connections
have
all
dried
up.
Your
connections
have
dried
up?
What,
you
think,
I
have
ties
I
have
5
joints.
You
think
I
can,
like,
-Yeah.
Oh,
my
God!
I
got
you.
I
got
the
door.
Okay.
-I'm
gonna
get
a
drink.
You
want
one?
-Coming?
Yeah,
I'll
meet
you
inside.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Shit.
Boner!
You
got
a
boner!
Yeah!
Thanks.
I
like
your
records.
Hey,
give
me
your
underwear.
-I
promise
you'll
get
them
back.
Thank
you.
-Who's
that?
I
don't
think
there's
any
pictures
-She
died
2
years
ago.
My
dad
remarried
last
year.
You
see
that
unholy
abomination
-Yeah.
Is
it?
She
had,
like,
a
nervous
breakdown
Lost
all
her
hair.
I
would
feel
bad
if
she
wasn't
-I'm
buzzed.
You?
-What
was
that?
I'm
gonna
go...
Yes.
I
think
I
drank,
like,
You
were
drinking
vermouth
Yeah,
it's
a
type
of
vodka.
You
okay?
Frigo?
What
are
you
doing?
Okay,

a
fever
of
103
Come
on,
baby
I'm
hot
blooded,
I'm
hot
blooded
-Hey,
I
feel
like
I
should
tell
you.
Yeah.
I
had
my
heart
broken
recently.
Is
that...
I
don't
know,
-That
sucks.
-Who
broke
your
heart?
Yeah,
it's
typical.
I
think
there
was
something
there.
I
think
that
we
actually
had,
I
don't
know.
I
think
she
was
afraid.
Afraid
of
what?
I
don't
know.
Was
the
sex
good?
She
was
very
sexy.
You've
been
with
a
lot
of
girls?
Yep.
Are
we
talking
about,
like,
Yeah.
No,
in
that
case,
there
were
actually
a
few
times
that
I...
Yeah,
a
few
times
I
could've
done
that.
But
it
wasn't...
It
wasn't
exactly
right.
Wait,
so
you're
telling
me
-There
were
circumstances...
-Oh,
my
God.
Okay,
all
right,
for
example,
junior
year,
Betsy
was
kind
of,
like...
Anyway,
one
day,
and
I
realized
I
don't
really
love
It
was
one
of
the
sonnets.
"Being
your
slave,
what
should
I
do
"but
tend
upon
the
hours
And
I
realized
I
don't
want
to
tend
All
right,
that
doesn't
matter.
Anyway,
I
drove
to
Betsy's
house,
and
that's
the
night
Can
you
believe
it?
It
was
the
same...
And
you
didn't
just
fuck
her
anyway?
No.
So
what
about
you
and
intercourse?
-Can
you
stop
saying
"intercourse"?
I
don't
know.
and
then,
like,
there
were
other
ones.
-Were
you
in
love
with
any
of
them?
Got
you.
Oh,
hey,
it's
Connell.
Hey,
Connell!
-Jimbo.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
These
guys
work
at
the
park.
Nice
to
meet
you.
-Hi.
We're
gonna
go
meet
some
friends
Cool.
Do
it!
My
nephew!
Is
that
Connell's
wife?
Yeah,
she
is.
She
works
-It's
kind
of
sad.
No,
I
mean
their
marriage
is
sad.
Are
you
sure
you
want
to
go?
-Yeah,
I
just
needed
some
air.

I

Your
pale

-Hey,
can
we
go
somewhere?
##
Thought
of
you
as
my
mountain
top
##
##
Thought
of
you
as
my
peak
##
##
Thought
of
you
as
everything

I've
had
but
couldn't
keep
##
Hey.
##
Linger
on
##
##
Your
pale
blue
eyes

-You
made
out
with
her?
I
don't
know
what
came
over
me.
Cool,
man.
How
was
that?
Fantastic.
Joel,
she's
like...
-Good
for
you,
man.
I
got
to
open
my
booth.
Hey,
do
you
have
an
ice-pick
I
can't
listen
to
this
song
again.
I
don't,
but
I
have
this.
-Be
cool
with
that.
-Were
you
on
a
date
last
night?
Not
into
Em?
No,
she's
great.
She's
great.
I
just...
I
don't
know
I'm
kind
of
getting
over
a
broken
heart.
-I
hope
you
didn't
tell
her
that.
You
told
her
that,
didn't
you?
James,
no
girl
wants
to
hear
about
-Right.
They
don't?
Look,
I'm
not
saying
I'm
just
saying
don't
play
that
card
first.
Wait,
it's
a
card?
Like
a
card?
There's
a
science
to
it.
-That
works
now.
Okay,
observe.
2
options.
I
can
play
it
safe,
or
I
can
rush
into
the
breach,
Make
a
run
right
at
the
cortex,
Fortune
favors
the
bold.
Virgil
said
that.
I'm
sure
Virgil
had
Bionic
Mutant
-All
right,
bye.
Okay,
but
I'm
probably
not
gonna
Hey.
I
really
want
to
see
you
tonight.
-Tonight?
Unless
you
got
something
else
You're
doing
really
good.
I
jump
when
he
jumps
Where?
Where
do
you
wanna
go?
We
can
go
to
my
mom's.
-Hey,
James?
Whoa,
bonus
round.
Kudos.
I
heard
you
might
have
some
weed.
Yeah,
I
have
a
stash.
Sometimes.
Beer?
-Got
anything
stronger?
So
what
excuse
for
coming
down
here
so
late?
Gotta
pump
some
midnight
iron?
Sometimes
I
come
here
to
practice.
You
still
hot
for
your
wife?
Why?
Why
would
you...
-Don't
be
mean.
No,
I'm
serious.
When
we're
together,
Let's
not
ruin
it.
Okay.
So,
how's
your
dad?
Since
he
can't
work,
Yeah.
Stays
in
bed
a
lot.
-Men
are
prideful
creatures.
Do
you
believe
in
God?
Wow,
theology
doesn't
come
up
Yeah,
but
you
see
someone
you
love
you
sort
of
think
I
believe
in
love.
I
mean,
I
mean,
transformable.
I
think
that
love
I'm
majorly
high.
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
shit.
Yeah,
me,
too.
I'm
having
dinner
with
my
parents.
Somebody's
hungry.
James,
I
read
-Is
that
so?
Yeah,
I
was
just
thinking
that,
you
know,
it
might
make
to
stay
close
to
home
for
a
while.
And
they
have
these
broadcasting
I
get

Mom,
I
thought
you
wanted
me
to
go
like
the
one
I've
been
accepted
to.
I
am...
I
am
just
trying
to
be
pragmatic.
They're
hand
puppets,
You
know,
like,
That's
a
terrible
impression.
James,
what
is
wrong
with
you?
We,

I
can't

Do
you
want
to
hear
What?
When
my
mom
first
started
getting,
my
dad
starts
going
to
temple.
He's
never
been
serious
about
his
faith.
But
he
decided
to
buddy
up
to
God,
like
he
thought
And
that's
where
he
met
Francy.
My
mom
loses
her
hair
in
chemo,
and
my
dad
starts
fucking
It's
just
weird.
I'll
take
you
home.
We
started
dancing
As
soon
as
we
started
to

music
played
while
our

It's

off.
Put

can
I
ask
you
something?
You
got
one
of
those
-I
do.
-Is
your
mom
okay?
Kind
of
nutty
since
my
dad
skipped
out.
Where'd
he
go?
I
don't
know.
He
left
a
long
time
ago.
-This
is
cool.
-Oh,
yeah,

Of
course.
Right

You
gotta
tell
me
your
Lou
Reed
story.
-Hey,
man,

it
going
with
Em?
She's...
I
think
I'm

in
my

I'm

Okay,

I'm
sorry.
Hey.
Let

That

Thanks.
-Hey,
so
how's
your

-Yeah?
Still...
Still
not
working?
The
Musik-Express!
-These
rides
are
safe,
right?
I
wouldn't
mess
around
on
any
of
them.
Last
summer,
there
was
this
drunk
idiot
trying
to
kick
his
buddy.
They
found
his
Reebok
-Yo,
Lisa.
We're
partners
today.
So
it's
official.
My
friend
Boomer
at
the
Mercedes
dealership
Yeah,
I'm
getting
a
car
right
away.
Yeah,
I'm
gonna
go
for
a
560,
I'm
even
gonna
get
-It's
gonna
be
insane.
So,
hey,
Lis,
you
wanna
-My
friend
Fitzy
got
me
floor
seats,
so...
And
go
get
the
hose.
You
don't
like
Priest?
-I'm
busy
that
night.
James,
you
and
I
should
go
out
I
get
it,
that's
a
funny
one.
Face!
Douche.
-Just
let
me
know
when.
Pete,
dried
puke.
I'm
serious.
I
wouldn't
mind
going
out
Cool.
Yeah.
That
would
be
very
cool.
Oh,
come
on,
man!
-Want
to
push
a
button?
Okay,
yeah,
which
one?
Okay.
-Oh,
my
gosh!
Wow!
You
fucked
this
up
perfectly!
-I
know.
I
work
on
games,
so...
I
know.
-Shit.
Connell,
I
need
to
ask
you
something.
Hand
me
the
crescent
wrench,
Yeah.
So,
Lisa
P.
just
asked
me
if
I
wanted
-Lisa
P.?
I
think
she
might've
just
been
trying
Can
you
imagine
any
universe
where
She
asked
you
out?
You're
a
fucking
idiot
if
you
don't
go.
-Hold
this,
would
you?
That
girl's
a
virgin.
Oh.
In
this
day
and
age.
You'd
think...
Well,
she's
a
Catholic
girl.
-But
what
they
will
let
you
do...
Are
you
getting
all
your
needs
We're
taking
it
slow.
Right.
Right.
Okay,
here's
the
thing.
Every
time
you
meet
a
beautiful
woman,
don't
you
imagine
what
she'd
look
like
-What?
No.
No.
I
mean,
Jesus
Christ,
it's
like
That's
a
little
hyperbolic,
but,
yeah,
That's
the
way
we're
wired.
It
sucks,
but
it's
just
a
fact
of
nature.
My
feelings
for
Em
are
vast.
James,
imagine
it.
Lisa
P.
I
know.
Lisa
P.
I
know.
-Hey.
I
brought
you
this.
It's
one
of
my
favorite
authors.
He
lost
his
mind,
died
a
week
later
of
self-starvation.
Well...
-Thank
you.
Hey,
do
you
maybe
want
to
go
see
Yeah,
I
just...
You
know,
I...
I
told
my
brother
that
-That's
bad?
But
he...
He
told
my
parents.
We're
Catholic.
Pete
told
my
parents
that
you're
Jewish.
But
I'm
an
atheist.
I
mean,
more
of
a
pragmatic
nihilist,
-or
an
existential
pagan,
if
you
will...
But
my
parents
are
really
strict.
I'm
sorry.
-It's
still
a
good
book.
-Hey,
Joel.
How'd
it
go
with
Sue?
Not
so
good.
Hey,
Em,
come
on.
Don't
say
anything!
Come
on,
worse
things
have
happened
Fuck
that!
You
know,
I
mean,
you're
an
anti-Semitic
asshole!
What
do
you,
like,
Do
you
support
apartheid?
Bam!
Child's
play.
Look,
you
can't
tell
anybody,
-You're
what?
This
morning
she
asked
me
What
happened?
I
am.
I
am.
But,
you
know,
like,
wants
something,
you
know,
And,
Joel,
we're
men.
You
know,
I
get
it,
it's
a
biological
imperative.
Frigo,
you
can't
tell
anybody,
What?
You
know,
-for
telling
a
lie
like
that.
-Where
are
you
going?
Thanks.
How's
the
wine?
-It's
good!
I
just
need
to
tell
you
something.
Yeah,
is
it
cool
if
we
don't
tell
'Cause
I
think
there's
someone
who
may
have
a
little
thing
for
me,
-You
mean
Em?
So
you
like
working
at
the
park?
Yeah,
I
think
it
could
be
And,
you
know,
Yeah,
you
and
Connell
Yeah,
I
like
him.
I
think
he's
interesting.
I
think
he's
kind
of
-That
guy's
got
some
problems.
Last
summer,
he
was
having
this
thing
He
used
to
take
her
to
his
mother's
His
mother's
basement.
But
he's
married,
right?
-Didn't
stop
him
from
hitting
on
me.
-Is
that
Frigo?
I
wonder
what
he's
doing
here.
Excuse
me.
-You
son
of
a
bitch,
that's
Lisa
P.!.
I'm
sorry.
Look,
I'm
sorry,
I
thought
There
she
is!
Think
you
can
get
me
Frigo,
get
the
fuck
out
of
here,
and
you
can't
tell
anybody
All
right,
all
right,
relax,
Brennan.
-What's
it
worth
to
you?
No...
Yeah,
yeah.
I
hate
you
with
such
great
fervor.
I...
Thanks,
Brennan.
Sorry
about
that.
What
a
coincidence.
Frigo
was
out
to
rent
a
video,
-Wow.
And
here
we
are.

want
to
visit

actually
wrote
but
he
visited
prisons...
Would
you
rather
have
a
sailboat
-Gee,
I
guess...
way
more
cooler,
you
know,
Though
I
bet
speedboats
would
be
What
were
you
saying?
Just
babbling.
Oh.
I
just
need
to
get
normal
Put
on
some
perfume
I
was
going
to
suggest
more
perfume.
-Shoot,
my
brush.
-Jesus,
what
the
hell
is
this?
-No.
I
guess
it's
my
dad's.
Can
you
smell
the
pot?
You
smell
amazing.
Thanks
for
tonight.
It
was
fun.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it
was.
Fondue.
-Oh,
God.
Sorry.
-Another
time.
-Good
night.
-Hey.
Hey.
I
missed
your
call
last
night.
I
was
out
-Sounds
fun.
We
got
caught
up
reminiscing.
But
what
were
you
calling
about?
Calling
to
say
sorry.
I
felt
like
I
was
Okay.
Sorry.
Yeah,
me,
too.
And
I
brought
you
something.
-This
bag?
-Is
that
a
couple
of
joints?
-Oh,
my.
You
follow
through.
Cool.
This'll
be
fun.
-Let's
do
it.
Walnuts?
You
want
to
see
me
go
-Home-made?
Yummy.
Sorry.
Spinning
on
that
dizzy
edge
I
kissed
her
face
And
dreamed
of
I
had
to
make
her
glow
"Why
are
you
so
far
away?"
she
said
"Why
won't
you
ever
know
"That
I'm
in
love
with
you"
You
You
You
Dancing
in
the
deepest
oceans
Twisting
in
the
water
And
what
a
race
we
have
here
today,
And
nobody
is
in
the
lead.
In
fact,
what
is
so
mind-blowing
is
how
evenly-matched
And
Yellow
is
dead
last.
This
is
a
fall
from
grace
You
know,
Yellow
has
inseminated
which
might
explain
And
you
won,
Number
9,
Hey,
Bobby.
Brennan,
what
are
you
doing?
-You
been
toking
up?
-You
been
drinking
drugs?
Your
eyes
are
red.
Yeah,
maybe,
like,
a
little
bit
before.
I'm
feeling
sick
because
I
think
I
ate
That's
why.
You
know,
why
don't
you
go
over
-and
collect
some
balls?
And
I'll
tell
you
what,
I'll
take
over
this.
Hey,
you
all
right?
-Yeah,
thank
you.
This
is
how
we
met.
And
they're
off!
In
the
lead
is
Green
5.
Green
5,
Green
5
in
the
lead.
Green!
You
really
got
it
going
on!
Green!
You
got
it,
Green!
You
won!
Pass
that
down
to
her.
-Can
I
get
some
balls?
The
customer's
always
right.
Here
you
go.
-I
hit
that
thing
dead-on!
Whoa,
whoa.
Come
on.
Hey!
What
the
fuck?
-It's
not
worth
it.
-Nicky.
The
fucking
thing
is
glued
on?
-Fuck
this,
Nicky.
-Yeah,
what's
so
fucking
funny?
-Oh,
my
God!
-What
the
fuck?
You
can't
do
shit
like
that.
-You
punch
him
in
the
face?
-Don't
fucking
touch
her,
man.
Oh,
fuck.
-You're
fucking
dead!

Get
out

me
a

Come
on!
Please!
-Bastard.
-No

Yeah,
yeah,
good.
You
know
what,
now
that
I
think
of
it,
You
guys
should
have
seen
-I
can't
believe
you
hit
someone.
How'd
you
do
it?
Dude,
this
guy
was
huge.
-And
just
dropped
the
guy.
Then
his
buddy
started
and
then
he
hid
in
Bobby's
office.
Yeah,
see,
that's
more
like
Bobby
kicked
the
door
down
and
came
out
all
psycho
And
all
his
buddies
just
go,
"Okay."
Where's
the
guy?
I
don't
know.
Then
I
got
his
girlfriend's
number.
Where
are
you
taking
me?
You've
never
been
to
this
place
before?
No.
I
think
you
might
be
the
coolest
Really?
I
mean,
I'm
really
high,
but...
I
don't
want
to
lose
you.
-Forget
to
refrigerate
these?
When
did
they
get
in,
yesterday?
-Around
what
time?
-They
smell
weird?
-I
think
that's
normal,
though.
Stuffy,
fry
these
up!
Hey,
Brennan,
I
want
to
talk
to
you.
-Yeah,
sure.
-What?
He
moved
on,
honey.
I
know,
I
heard
you!
-What
are
you
doing
here?
Look,
I
can't
abide
the
humiliation
The
vile
plastic
slipcovers,
And
it's
really
messy.
Okay.
Hey,
Jeffrey!
-Fine.
-Fuck
off,
fuck
face.
I
hate
you,
asshole.
-Hey,
is
it
because
of
Sue?
Why
you
quit.
Because,
Joel,
and
she
doesn't
deserve
you.
James,
look
at
me.
And
I'm
poor.
when
there's
all
these
That's
ridiculous.
You
know,
Em
isn't
like
that.
-Em?
You
don't
even
appreciate
You're
chasing
after
Lisa
P.
when
you
have
this
incredible,
Fuck
this.
Don't
do
that.
-I
thought
you
were
off
today.
Last
week
I
went
on
a
date
with
Lisa
P.
It
was
nothing.
We
kissed
a
little
bit
and
I
felt
her
breast
a
little
bit,
Right.
No
intercourse?
No.
No
intercourse.
Look,
I'm
sorry,
it's
just...
You
and
I
I
don't
want
to
see
her
again,
okay?
Look,
we'll
both
be
in
New
York
soon,
I
want
to
get
to
know
you
better,
if
you
want
to
get
to
know
me
better
James,
you
don't
owe
me
anything.
I
know,
but
I
want
to
owe
you
things.
I'm
ready
to
owe
you
things,
okay?
-Are
you
mad
at
me?
'Cause
I'm
sorry.
Thanks
for
telling
me.
-Are
you
crazy?
You
can't
come
here.
I'm
starting
to
really
Oh,
Christ.
Just...
I
gotta...
I
gotta
go
make
an
excuse.
-Okay.
Brennan.
Yo,
Brennan.
Brennan,
you
gotta
hear
this.
I
ate
too
many
circus
peanuts.
No,
what?
No,
not
that,
retard.
Frigo,
shut
up.
I
saw
Em
and
Connell
in
his
car.
Right,
right.
They
were
doing
push-ups
in
his
car.
No
pants.
-James,
they
were
fucking.
-When
did
you
see
this,
Rich?
It
was
just
a
couple
-Hello?
She
said
she
was
with
you.
Oh,
yeah.
Okay,
bye.
What'd
he
say?
Can
you
get
your
mother's
car?
All
right,
I
got
the
keys.
Push
me
out.
I
don't
want
to
drink.
Did
you
know
James
went
out
-I
know.
-You
want
me
to
rat
out
James?
-Slow
down.
It's
Em's
car.
Let's
wait
here.
I
stole
some
of
my
grandma's
-No.
-No,
please.
Can
you
sit
down,
please,
-Look,
you
want
to
end
this?
I
got
a
hockey
stick
in
the
back,
-Frigo,
shut
the
fuck
up,
okay?
-Just
trying
to
help.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Are
you
and
Connell,
like...
It
started
in,
like...
How
did
you...
What
are
you...
Lisa
P.
told
me
that
Connell
used
to
to
his
mother's
basement.
Right.
Yeah,
I
just,
like,
don't
understand
I
came
here
to...
I
know.
I
know
I
fucked
up,
too,
okay?
I
fucked
up
one
time,
and
I
fucking
You
think
I'm,
like,
some
fucking
You're
not
a
fucking
idiot.
Yeah,
that's
right.
Shit.
I
am
the
champion.
-Here
you
go.
-Is
it
a
banana?
I'd
watch
my
mouth
if
I
were
you,
Hey.
What's
up?
I
mean...
I
actually
feel
sorry
for
them,
you
know.
Like,
sneaking
around
It's,
like,
so
pathetic.
I
know.
I
know.
Hey,
Lisa,
you
can't,
like,
Of
course,
I
would
never.
Thanks.
Hey,
Em,
what's
up?
Loving
life,

a

Francy,
these
pieces,
I
love
them.
Those
there?
I
love
those.
You're
so
artsy.
-Thank
you.
I
thought
the
house
was
a
lot
nicer
It's
pretty
barfarific,
if
you
ask
me.
-Is
that
some
kind
of
joke,
Emily?
I
think
you
owe
me
an
apology.
I
don't
owe
you
shit.
All

okay.
You
know
what?
Look,
you
weren't
invited,
-Right,
I
wasn't
invited
to
this

and

I
am

tired
of
your

me

can

How

Well,
Europe
changed
me.
There
I
was,
going
from
The
ruins,
the

And
I
realized
something.

-What?
-What

mean?
You're
what?
You're
applying?
No,
I'm

Take
care
of
yourself,
Brennan.
Yeah,
you,
too.
-Where
were
we?
-Satellite
Of
Love.
That's
what
we
were
talking
about.
That's
my
favorite
one!
Yeah,
it's
a
good
tune.
Yes!
We
got
the
Viet
Cong,

gonna

Your
Herman
Melville
story,
It's
true.
They
called
him
Henry.
No,
I
mean
he
wrote
about
the
whaling
industry.
I
think
he
was
I
hope
they
call
me
Henry
Yeah?
One
can
only
hope.
Brennan,
don't
get
all
drunk
-Why?
-Okay,
I'm
gonna
go.
I'll
see
you
around,
Frigo.
All
right.
Good
luck
with
him.
Even.
Good
one!
That
was
nice,
Brennan.
That
was
nice.
That
must
have
hurt.
Look
me
in
the
eye
Then
tell
me
that
I'm
satisfied
Hey,
are
you
satisfied?
And
it
goes
so
slowly
on
Everything
I've
ever
wanted
Tell
me
what's
wrong
Look
me
in
the
eye
And
tell
me
that
I'm
satisfied
Were
you
satisfied?
Hi.
I
just
got
off
the
bus.
I
guess
I
should
I
don't
think
I
can
see
you.
What?
This
summer
was
rough.
I
did
things
that
I
really,
really
regret.
Yeah,
me,
too.
I'm
sorry
I
told
Lisa
P.
She,
you
know,
I'm
not
gonna
lie.
but
you
didn't
deserve
that.
You
know,

am
so
sorry
for

this
up.
You

you
were

Wait,

I
maybe
see
you
Yes,
I

the
person
who
fucked
up,
who
saved
me
from
being
knifed
who
introduced
me
and
who
stood
up
for
Joel,
and
Look,
my
theory
is
you
can't
just
avoid
And
you
should
trust
me.
-You
are
soaking
wet.
Do
you
have
anything
else
I'll
check.
-Do
you
want
some
tea?
No,
everything
in
here
is
soaking
wet.
-Here.
So
you're
going
to
Columbia?
No.
No.
Maybe
next
year.
No.
Why?
I
wrecked
my
dad's
car,
So
what's
the
plan?
I'm
gonna
crash
at
the
Y

a
week.
I

Here.
Give
me
your

-I'll

you

Hey,
Em.
I
really
missed
you.
You
wanna
wear
this?
I...
No.
No.
Why
do
you
have
that?
