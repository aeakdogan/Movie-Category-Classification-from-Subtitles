Majesty

as
Eisenheim

charges
of

How
does
he

it?
I'm
afraid
I
still
don't

Did
you
ask
him?
He's
not
talking
at
this
point.
Well,
I'm
sure
for
that
kind
of
thing.
I
want
you
to
put
an
end
to
it.
Surely
you
have
something
on
him.
Something
from
his
past?
Yes.
Yes,
I
think
I
do.

For
Herr
Eisenheim.

Hello,
Sophie.
When
I
was
on
the
stage,
It
took
me
a
moment...
but,
yes,
I
knew.
You
could
have
said
something.
I
thought
you'd
figure
Yes,
I
would
have.
I
would
have
come
another
night,
walked
right
on
stage
And
then
you'd
really
I
suspect
you
would
have.
I
don't
understand
why.
Perhaps
for
the
same
reasons
you
It's
just
a
game
I'm
followed
everwyhere.
It's...
Yes.
So,
I
hear
congratulations
What
for?
They
say
you'll
be
the
princess.
-
It's
not
decided
at
all.
It
makes
a
certain
sense,
I
suppose.
We've
known
each
other
for
years,
He's
very
intelligent.
A
little
too
intelligent
You're
lucky,
you
know...
to
have
broken
free
as
you
did.
I
often
wish
that
I
had...
Wished
what?
Wished
that
I
would
see
you
again.
And
now
you
have.
Yes,
now
I
have.
I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
Until
then.


Here's
the
report
Mmm.
Anything
interesting?
See
for
yourself.

The
magician?
They
drove
around
for
half
an
hour.
Then
he
got
out
near
the
theater.
What
do
you
want
us
to
do?
Join
us
for
a
drink?
Please.
You
like
something
to
eat,
-
No,
thank
you.
I'm
going
to
ask
you
a
question...
that
may
not
seem
friendly...
but
I
assure
you,
in
fact,
is.
What
is
your
relationship
You're
right,
Oh,
but
that
is
precisely
my
point.
For,
you
see,
a
discreet
carriage
ride
I
am
willing
to
find
out
All
right.
We
were
Acquaintances?
Childhood
friends.
My
father
was
a
cabinetmaker.
-
He
made
the
furniture
for
her
family's
house.
I
see,
the
cabinetmaker's
son
-
Has
there
been
a
complaint?
well,
we'd
be
having
a
very,
uh,
Yes.
He
relies
on
you
for
I'm
a
simple
public
servant,
That's
not
what
I
hear.
I
hear
you'll
be
-
Maybe
mayor
of
Vienna?
Party
secretary?
You
better
hope
he
doesn't
dissolve
Now
the
prince
has
some
progressive
ideas,
Well,
they
say
you're
very
close
to
him,
Look.
Yes,
indeed,
they
say
But
the
simple
truth
of
the
matter
is,
He's
the
heir
to
the
empire.
Hmm?
Do
you
see
my
point?
Don't
fool
yourself
that
I've
served
on
the
edge
of
it...
for...
many,
many
years...
and
I
can
tell
you
with
certainty...
there's
no
trick
they
haven't
seen.
It's
not
worth
it.
My
guest
tonight...
is
not
a
showman
at
all,
who
has
sold
his
soul
in
return
for
unholy
powers.
Or
so
at
least
some
of
our
friends
here
-

Everything
can
-
All
mysteries
penetrated.


-

Is
that
the
emperor?
I
didn't
think
he
was
invited.

A
fair
likeness
of
the
old
man.
-
Too
modern
a
style
for
him,
of
course.
I'm
afraid
I'm
not
much
It's
true.
There
are
no
brushstrokes
I
can
see
that
clearly.
So
to
achieve
the
color...
some
sort
of
chemical
must
Some
sort
of
sprayer
up
your
sleeve?
-
May
I?
-
I
do.
You
want
me
to
just
sit
there
-

He
tries
to
trick
you.
Which
is
the
more
noble
pursuit?
May
we
have
the
lights,
please...
so
His
Highness
can
better
see?
-

See
here,
Leopold,
let's
have
the
show.
-
Come
on,
Leopold.

Why
don't
you
astonish
us...
if
you
can...
without
all
the...
gadgetry?
As
you
wish.
Your
sword
is
very
beautiful.
Might
I
see
it?
Certainly.
May
I?
Where
does
power
flow
from?
Skill
or
destiny,
or
divine
right?
We
all
know
the
story
Excalibur's
blade
and
there
it
stayed.

Many
worthy
knights
tried
to
Only
Arthur
succeeded...
proving
his
right
to
rule.
Who
can
take
this
sword?
You,
sir,
can
you
take
the
sword?


No
surprise
there.
-

-
Not
so
eager,
cousin.

-

Do
it!
Do
it!


You
shall
live
a
long
life.
Thank
you
for
your
indulgence.

Come
now.
If
you
can't
pull
it
out,
-
Your
father
will
live
to
be
a
hundred.

The
sword
to
its
rightful
owner!

That's
enough
light
entertainment
For
more
serious
discussion,

Shut
him
down.
Well,
he's
very
popular,
I'm
sure
you'll
find
a
way.
-
What
did
you
do
to
him?
What
would
possess
you

Duchess
von
Teschen,
We
don't
want
to
keep
-
Did
you
enjoy
the
show?
It
was
amusing.

Who
told
you
where
to
find
me?
Your
manager.
I
told
him
if
he
wants
Ah,
so
I'm
to
be
driven
-
Good.
I
shall
relish
it.
I
came
here
to
try
to
help
you.
Why?
Why
should
you
possibly
You
were
my
friend.
We
knew
each
other
very
briefly
Then
why
did
you
speak
to
me?
And
you
kept
it
all
this
time.
I
used
to
sit
and
stare
trying
to
imagine
where
you
were.
At
night
I'd
have
dreams
and
then
I'd
wake
up
But
in
my
dreams
you

Where
did
you
go
when
you
left?
To
my
uncle's
farm
near
Prague.
How
exotic.

I
went
to
Russia...
then
Asia
Minor...
and
then
the
Orient
for
many
years.
So
long.
I
always
meant
to
return.
I
just...
I
kept
thinking
I'd
find
it
What?
A
real
mystery.
I
saw
remarkable
things...
but
the
only
mystery
why
my
heart
couldn't
let
go
of
you.

He
wants
me
to
go
to
Budapest...
with
him
next
week
He
wants
the
Hungarians
behind
him.
They're
going
to
crown
him
king.
I'm
sure
his
father
will
have
He
plans
to
overthrow
his
father.
That
could
go
very
badly
for
him...
and
for
you.
You
shouldn't
be
involved.

He
only
gets
Hungary
by
-
Leave
him.
Call
it
off
and
come
away
with
me.
Or
don't
say
anything
As
long
as
we're
alive...
he'll
hunt
us.
And
when
he
finds
us,
he'll
kill
us.
Look
at
me.
Do
you
truly
want
to
leave
with
me?
Yes,
I
do.
There
you
are.
As
I
predicted,
Are
you
happy
now,
hmm?
It
doesn't
matter
that
we
were
No,
look.
You
got
it
off
your
chest.
-
Do
we
have
money?
-
Do
we
have
any
money
saved?
But
we
could
have
had
Mmm,
it
will
have
to
do.
And
the
second
account,
all
of
it.

Thank
you.

And
you
have
no
doubt
I'd
stake
my
life
on
it.
What
was
in
this
suitcase?
I
don't
know.
He's
by
the
first
car.


When
it's
done,
you'll
travel
ahead

And
she
understands


As
you
know,
we
sometimes
follow...
Duchess
von
Teschen
Yesterday
she
was
seen
What
man?
Eisenheim
the
Illusionist.
What
were
they
doing?
-
Well,
they
were
meeting
and,
uh...
Fornicating?
Not
that
we
observed,
no.
However,
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
It's
possible
they
may
be
leaving.
I'm
not
certain
of
anything
yet,
Thank
you,
Inspector.

We
can,
of
course,
acquire
more
information...

He's

What
a
surprise.

didn't

years

Are

to
embarrass
me?
It
has
everything
to
do
with
me!
You
will
not
share
my
bed
You
don't
understand.
I'm
not
going
to
share
I'm
not
going
to
Budapest
with
you.
I
don't
want
to
be
part
And
I
will
not
marry
you.
I
assume
you
haven't
been
so
stupid
'Cause
if
you
disrupt
my
plans,
I
will
have
Now,
you
will
travel
I
recommend
that
you
are
here
early,
Do
nothing
more
to
embarrass
me.
Good-bye.
What
do
you
mean,
"Good-bye"?
Come
back
here!
Don't
disobey
me
again.

-


No,
leave
that.


Duchess
von
Teschen!



Whoa.
Whoa.
I
thought
you
saw
her
No,
sir.

were

in

Yes,
I
am.
You

Of
course

understand.

There's

apologies,
of
course.

Probably
robbed.
Saw
all
those
diamonds,
Chief
Inspector,
-
Yes,
what
is
that?
I
found
this
small
gemstone.
Seen
last
Thursday
at
7:30
p.m.
toward
the
Imperial
Hunting
Lodge.
Groomsman
said
What
was
she
doing
riding
alone?

He
did
this.
-
I
know
who
did
what?
He
killed
her.
He's
done
it
No,
I
don't
know
that.
In
fact,
-
He
killed
her
before
he
left!
-
She
was
leaving
him.
-
Yes!
He
killed
her
because
-
She
knew
his
secret.
-
Ask
your
inspector.
He
knows...

No,
not
completely.
No.
Which
is
why
I'll
advise
you
not
to
accuse
Or
you
will
end
up
in
jail
yourself.

-
Where's
the
guard
who
let
her
out
of
the
gate?
-
Did
any
of
the
servants
see
her
leave?
Ah-ha.
He,
uh,
he
put
her
horse
Ah.
Was
it
this
one?
We
don't
have
jurisdiction
Thank
you.
So
what
are
you
doing?

Listening
to
that
magician,
are
you?
For
all
we
know,
he
did
it.
No,
I
think
not.
The
crown
prince
is
back.

-
Chief
Inspector.
We
should
go.
Now.
-

What
have
you
found
out?
-
She
was
last
seen
riding
here,
alone.
And
based
on
your
information,
-
Did
she
commit
suicide?
-
Do
you
have
a
suspect?

Later
that
week,

I

With

With
these

Eisenheim
has
given
us
hard
proof...

First,
we
have
to
show
it
is
fraud.
Find
out
how
the

is
done,
This
is
just
a

demonstration,

you
can

how
it

Yes,
I

you

me,

Inspector.
Yes,

remember.

going
on?
Why
all
the
police?

Precautions.
Oh,
that's
entirely
up
to
him.

Why
were
you
murdered?

I
was
leaving
him.

prince?

We
won't
stand
for
it!
I
was
wearing
my
locket
when
I
died.
But
now
it's
gone.

Tell
us,
please.
Who
murdered
you?
We
must
do
something!

along.

it!

it,

von
Teschen's
body...

after
that,
I
came
in
here...
and
you
asked
me
why
I
was
late.
You've
stolen
Imperial
property.
That
seems
trivial

if
that
were
true,
you
have

right.

may
do

you
wish
here,

can
punish
you.

man.

emperor.

crown

never

you.

a
letter
telling
them...
everything.

your
plan
I
know
they'll
listen
to
that.
You'll
not

throne...

no
longer

to
be

You
don't
want
to
be

afraid

fool.

manipulating
you.

had
the
sword

could
have
pried
the
stones
loose

has
planted
everything.
It's
all
a
trick.
Perhaps
there's
truth
You
need
to
wire
your
driver,
-
Or
what?
And
then
you'll
have
killed
Or
perhaps
you'll
kill
yourself.
You,
uh,
committed
suicide,

Ah.
Some
officers
They
must
have
received
my
letter.

What
do
you
want?
Fine.
Fine.
You
shall
have
nothing.

Gentlemen...
Everyone's
completely
incompetent.

father
runs
the
empire

no
one
notices,
no
one

propose
to
clean
up

all
becoming
irrelevant.

There's

too
much.
