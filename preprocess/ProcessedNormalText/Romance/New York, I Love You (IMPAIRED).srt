know,
I
felt
it
right
away--
I'm
gonna
say
something

I
think
you
might
I
don't
know
that
that
I'd
tell
you.

not
exactly
friends.
No.

we
did
share
a
flame.

at
that.

walking
away,

share
a
flame.

penetrating

don't
know
about
you,

to
find
and
locate

I
could

just
happen
to
know
It's
kind
of
cool,
But
you
have
to
You
know
what
I
mean?
I
mean,
it
starts
You
know,
like,
to,
uh--
It's
a
couple
blocks
from
here.
and
I
would
tell
you
You
know,
kind
of
getting
us
a
little
giggly,
You
know?
And
then
we'd
share
Yeah.
We'd
bask
romantic
yet
erotic
of,
uh,
my
spacious
loft.
And
then
and
you
would
undress
me.
We'd
stand
naked
before
I
find--
I
find
kissing
sweet
way
to--
to
relax.
And
then,
maybe
I
would--
I
would
bite
your
neck

Not
hard.
Just
gentle--
like--
like
a
little
kitty
cat,
And
then--
my
hands
