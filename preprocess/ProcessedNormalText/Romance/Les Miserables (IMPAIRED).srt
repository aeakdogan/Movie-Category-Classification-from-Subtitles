Get

Hey!

Come
in,
And
the
night
is
cold
Though
our
lives
What
we
have
There
is
wine
There
is
bread
There's
a

Rest
from

Bless
the

eat
today.
Bless
our
dear

Get
in
there!
Stay
there!

CONSTABLE:
Monsignor.
We
have
your
silver.
We
caught
this
man
He
had
the
nerve
to

That
is
right
But,
my
friend,
Surely
something
You
forgot
I
gave
these
also
Would
you
leave
Messieurs,
release
him
This
man
has
spoken
true
I
commend
you
for
your
duty
Now
God's
blessing
go
with
you
But
remember
this,
my
brother
See
in
this
some
higher
plan
You
must
use
To
become
an
honest
man
By
the
witness
of
the
martyrs
By
the
passion
and
the
blood
God
has
raised
I
have
saved
your
soul
for
God

What
have
I
done?
Become
a
thief
in
the
night
Have
I
fallen
so
far
That
nothing
remains
The
cries
in
the
dark
Here
where
I
stand
at
If
there's
another
way
to
go
I
missed
it
20
long
years
ago
My
life
was
a
war
They
gave
me
a
number
When
they
chained
me
Just
for
stealing

Yet
why
did
I
allow
this
man
To
touch
my
soul
He
treated
me
like
any
other
He
gave
me
his
trust
My
life
he
claims
Can
such
things
be?
For
I
had
come
This
world
that
Take
an
eye
for
an
eye!
Turn
your
heart
into
stone!
This
is
all
I
have
lived
for!
This
is
all
I
have
known!
One
word
from
him
Beneath
the
lash,
Instead
he
offers
me
I
feel
my
shame
inside
me
He
told
me
that
I
have
a
soul
How
does
he
know?
What
spirit
comes

Is
there
another
way
to
go?
I
am
reaching
but
I
fall
And
the
night
is
closing
in
As
I
stare
into
the
void
To
the
whirlpool
of
my
sin
I'll
escape
now
From
the
world
of
Jean
Valjean
Jean
Valjean
is
nothing
now!
Another
story
must
begin!

And
that's
all
you

It's

It's

And
there's

One

standing

One

At

Can
this

A
man
your
age
A
memory
stirs
You
make
me
think
of
a

From
years

A

He
disappeared
Say

Forgive

How

I'll

There
was
a
time
When
their
voices
were
soft
And
their
words
inviting
There
was
a
time
And
the
world
was
a
song
And
the
song
was
exciting
There
was
a
time
Then
it
all
went
wrong
I
dreamed
a
dream
When
hope
was
high
I
dreamed
that
I
dreamed
that
God
Then
I
was
young
and
unafraid
And
dreams
were
made
There
was
no
ransom
to
be
paid
No
song
unsung,
But
the
tigers
come
at
night
With
their
voices
As
they
tear
your
hope
apart
As
they
turn
He
slept
a
summer
by
my
side
He
filled
my
days
He
took
my
childhood
But
he
was
gone

And
still
I
dream
That
we
will
live
But
there
are
dreams
And
there
are
storms

I
had
a
dream
my
life
would
be
So
different
from
So
different
now
Now
Life
has
killed
the
dream
I
dreamed
Have
you
anywhere
to
go?

BAMATABOlS:
PlMP:
Here's

You've
got
some
nerve,



By

I
guarantee
I
beg
you,
I'll
do
whatever
Make
your
excuse
to
the
police
Tell
me

Who

Javert,
would
you
believe
it?
When
this
She
will
answer
You
may
rest
assured,

There's
a
child
Please,
monsieur,
Holy
God,
is
there
no
mercy?
If
I
go
to
jail
she'll
die
I
have
heard
Let's
have
Save
your

Honest
work,
just
reward
That's
the

A
moment
of
your

Javert
Monsieur
le
Mayor!
You've
done
your
duty,
She
needs
a
doctor,
Monsieur
le
Mayor!
Can
this
be?
Where
will
she
end
This
child
without
a
friend?
I've
seen
your
face
before

Show
me
some
way
to
help
you
How
have
you
come
to
grief
Monsieur,
It's
hard
enough
You
let
your
foreman
Yes,
you
were
there


I
never
did
no
wrong
Is
it
true
what
I've
done...
My
daughter's
close
to
dying
...
to
an
innocent
soul?
If
there's
a
God
above...
Had
I
only
known
then
...he'd
let
me
die
instead
In
His
name
I
will
take
her
Monsieur
le
Mayor.
Where
is
your
child?
With
an
innkeeper
I
will
send
for
her

Rest.
From
Paris,
monsieur.

Monsieur
le
Mayor,
I
have
disgraced
I've
done
you
wrong
I've
been
as
hard
I
mistook
you
for
a
convict
Now
I
learn
And
of
course
But
he
couldn't
run
forever
You
say
this
man
denies
it
all
And
gives
no
sign

And

It's
a
minor
sin
All
of
us
have
You'll
return,
sir,

They
think
that
man
is
me
This
stranger
they
have
found
Why
should
I
save
his
hide?
When
I
have
come
so
far
If
I
speak,
I
am
condemned
If
I
stay
silent,
I
am
the
master
of
They
all
look
to
me
Can
I
abandon
them?
If
I
speak,
they
are
condemned
If
I
stay
silent
I
am
damned
Who
am
I?
Can
I
condemn
Pretend
I
do
not
This
innocent
Who
goes
to
judgment
Who
am
I?
Can
I
conceal
Pretend
I'm
not
And
must
my

Must

How

How

MAGlSTRATE:
Monsieur

You've
played
the

away
And
soon
it
will
be

Come
to

Cosette,
the

Don't
you
see
The
evening
star
appearing?
Come
to

And
rest
against
my

How
fast
the

fly
away

Dear

Your

And
I'll

"Monsieur

Before
you

Before
you
chain
me
up
Listen
to
me!
This
woman
leaves
There
is
none
but
me
In
mercy's
name,
Then
I'll
return,
Then
I'll

You
must
think
me

You

nothing
of
my

No,

All
I
did
was
steal
some
bread
My
duty
is
to
the
law
You
know
nothing
You
have
no
rights
You
would
sooner
Come
with
me,

But
not
before
JAVERT:
Now

Valjean
Dare
you
talk
to
me
I
am
warning
you,

And
the
price
I'm
the
stronger
man
by
far!
Every
man
is
born
in
sin
There
is
power
in
me
yet!
Every
man
My
race
is
not
yet
run!
You
know
nothing
of
Javert!
I
was
born
inside
a
jail!
I
was
born
I
am
from
the
gutter,
too!


There
is
a
castle
on
a
cloud
I
like
to
go
there
in
my
sleep
Aren't
any
floors
Not
in
my
castle
on
a

There
is
a
lady
all
in
white
Holds
me
and
sings
a
lullaby
She's
nice
to
see
She
says,
I
know
a
place
I
know
a
place
Crying
at
all
is
not
allowed
Not
in
my
castle
on
a
cloud

Now
look
who's
here!
The
little
madam
herself
Pretending
once
again
Better
not
let
me
Ten
rotten
francs
Now
take
that
pail
And
go
and
draw
We
should
never
How

Mama!

You
look
very
well
in
Oh.
There's
some
little
girls
And
they
know
what
to
wear
Still
there,
Cosette?
I
told
you,
fetch
some
water
Please
do
not
Not
in
the
darkness
on
my
own
Now
shut
your
face
or
You
heard
me
ask
for
something
Wakey-wakey,
we're

I
love
you.

Landed

Hush
now
Don't
hide
Tell
me,
my
child,
I'm
called
Cosette

Mademoiselle.
Whoa!

I
found
her
This
little
child,
And
I
am
here
I
will
settle
any
debt
I
will
pay
what
I
must
pay
To
take
Cosette
away
I
love
you.


And
there
is
For
I
was
blind
I
did
not
see
Now
your
mother
is
with
God

Her
suffering
is
over
And
I
speak
here
And
I
stand
here
in
her
place
Come
on.
And
from
this
day,
Let
me
take
Cosette
shall
live
You
are
very
welcome
here
I
will
not
forget
my
vow
Take
a
drink
Take
a
chair
Cosette
shall
What
to
do?
Shall
you
carry
What
a
gem!
Beyond
rubies
is
How
can
we
Let's
not
haggle
Cosette.
Dear
Fantine,
Have
we
done
for
her
I
think
so.
Shared
our
bread,
Treated
her
like
Yes,
our
own.
Like
our
own,
The
cost
adds
up.
Your
feelings
do
And
I
will
ease
Let
us
not
talk
of
bargains
Now
may
I
say
we
are
agreed?
That
would
If
she
hadn't
Little
dear,
cost
us
dear
Medicines
are
expensive,

Not
that
we
begrudged
a
sou
It's
no
more
than
Than
we
Christians
may
do
No
more
words!
Fifteen
hundred
Come,
Cosette,
Let
us
seek
out
Thank
you,
both,
for
Cosette
It
won't
take
you
Farewell,
Courgette!
It's
"Cosette."
And,
open.
It's
for
you.

Will
you
be
Yes,
Cosette
I'll
be
father

Not
bad.
There's
a
copper
at
the
door
Where's
the
child
Cosette?

Didn't
tell
us
Didn't
leave
You're
a
bloody
fool
Should've
struck
the
iron
Next
time
round,
I
promise
Okay?

Suddenly
it
starts
Can
two
anxious
hearts
Yesterday
I
was
alone
Today
you
are
beside
me
Something
still
unclear
Something
not
yet
here
Suddenly
the
world
Somehow
full
of
grace
How
was
I
to
know
Was
held
inside
me?
What
is
passed
is
gone
Now
we
journey
on
How
was
I
to
know
at
last
Trusting
me
the
way
you
do
I'm
so
afraid
of
failing
you
Just
a
child
who
cannot
know
There
are
shadows
everywhere
And
memories
I
cannot
share
Nevermore
alone
Nevermore
apart
You
have
warmed
my
heart
You
have
brought
Suddenly
I
see
What
I
could
not
see
Something
suddenly
Has
begun

Halt!
Where
are
you
traveling?
Cosette.
Cosette.

Give
me
the
doll.
Come.
JAVERT:
Valjean!
Come,
Cosette.
Come
on.
24601!


Cosette.
I've
got
you.
Valjean!


Who's
there?
Please,
monsieur.
I
need
your
help.
Please,
please.
Monsieur
le
Mayor?
Who
are
you?
Fauchelevent.
I
fell
under
my
cart.
You
saved
my
life,
monsieur.
Fauchelevent.
We
need
a
place
of
sanctuary,
We
need
to
disappear.

We'll
give
thanks
What
the
sisters
may
ordain
Come.
Here
we
pray
Here
our
lives

There,
A
fugitive
running
Fallen
from
God
Fallen
from
grace
God
be
my
witness
I
never
shall
yield
Till
we
come
face
to
face
Till
we
come
face
to
face
He
knows
his
way
in
the
dark
Mine
is
the
way
of
the
Lord
Those
who
follow
Shall
have
their
reward
And
if
they
fall
The
flames!
The
sword!
Stars
in
your
multitudes
Scarce
to
be
counted
Filling
the
darkness
With
order
and
light
You
are
the
sentinels
Silent
and
sure
Keeping
watch
in
the
night
Keeping
watch
in
the
night
You
know
your
place
in
the
sky
You
hold
your
course
And
each
in
your
season
And
is
always
the
same
And
if
you
fall
You
fall
in
flames!
And
so
it
must
be,
On
the
doorway
to
paradise
That
those
who
falter
Must
pay
the
price
Lord,
let
me
find
him
That
I
may
see
him
Safe
behind
bars!
I
will
never
rest
till
then!
This
I
swear
This
I
swear
by
the
stars!

Come
on,
boys!

Come
on.

a
victim
Dear
Inspector,

And
remember

When
