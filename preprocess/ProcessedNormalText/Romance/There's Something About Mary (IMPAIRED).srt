Sure.
Aah.
Oh.
Mary:
Ok.
Ok,
Ted.
Ok,
let's
roll.

All
right,
folks,
So,
anyway,
uh...
school
ended
and
her
father
to
Florida
in
July.
So
I
worked
all
summer...
to
pay
off
those
debts
Well,
I
never
saw
Mary
That
was...
what?
13
years
ago.
That's
very
interesting.
Anyway...
I
know
it's
not
the
type
but
I
guess
I
just...
I
must
have
blocked
it
'cause
I
was
driving
down
and
I
started
thinking
and
all
of
a
sudden...
it
was
like
I
mean,
I
was...
I
was...
I
felt
like
So
I
pulled
off
the
road...
and
I
just
sorta
stopped
I
guess
I
was
just

You
know...
rest
areas
are
Highway
rest
areas.
They're
the
bathhouses
of
the
'90s
for
many,
many,
many
gay
men.
So
what...
what
are
you...
What
are
you
saying?
Oop.
Time,
she's
up.
We'll,
uh,
delve
into
that
next
week.
Well,
you
know,
you
are
a
writer,
and
writers
are
artists.
And
most
artists
A
little
foofy.
Hey,
you
guys,
I
thought
Yes,
indeed.
Ted,
help
yourself.
I
don't
think
I'll
have
one.
-
You
don't
want
one?
You
want
something
else?
Come
on.
Not
hungry,
thank
you.
You
want
a
cookie,
something
like
that?
Honey,
we
got
cookies?
Uh,
no,
we
don't,
No,
no,
no.
Don't
bake
any.
No,
that's
a
good
idea.
Bake
some
tollhouses.
Oh,
great.
Yeah,
yeah.
-
Uh,
chocolate
chip
or
butterscotch?
-
OK.
Good.
No,
it's
fine.
Don't
worry.
She
loves
this
kind
of
thing.
Really?
See,
that's
great.
That's
what
I
want,
a
family,
and
somebody
to,
you
know...
It
must
be
wonderful
Each
day
is
better
than
the
next.
How
about
you?
The
big
"L."
Hmm?
-
Ever
been?
In
lurve.
Well,
once.
Mary.
Oh,
God.
Not
Mary
again.
Look,
I
know
it
was
brief,
but
it
was
it
was
definitely
love,
Dom.
I
mean,
What
ever
happened
to
Mary?
-
She
moved
with
her
family
to
Miami.
I
did
once.
I
called.
She
wasn't
listed.
So
that's
it?
You
get
one
little
bump
It's
probably
for
the
best.
After
13
years,
she's
probably
gonna
think
You
know
what
you
should
do
You
know,
to
find
her,
follow
her
around.
No
way!
That's
way
too
creepy.
Besides,
she's
probably
married
Girls
like
Mary...
Hey,
I've
got
an
idea.
There's
this
guy
down
in
my
office.
He's
a
claims
investigator.
He
goes
to
Miami
every
couple
of
weeks.
This
guy
runs
a
little
hot,
So.
Dom
says
you're
looking
for
some
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's
cute.
I
don't
buy
it,
but
it's
cute.
You're
not
buying
what?
Ted,
I'm
the
kind
of
guy
Ahem.

I
want
you
to
level
Come
on,
let's
talk.
Did
you
knock
No.
She's
blackmailing
you,
Blackmailing
me?
No.
You
want
her
dead,
Dead?
Were
you...
You're
not
serious,
You
expect
me
to
believe...
this
is
a
straight
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
I'm
not
a
stalker.
-
She's
a
friend
of
mine.
That
explains
why
she's
got
and
you
haven't
heard
squat
Yeah.
A
real
chum.
You're
good,
Ted.
Real
piece
of
work.
You
know
what?
Forget
it.
Just
forget
the
whole
thing.
OK,
I'll
do
it.
But
if
this
chick
turns
up
with
a
toe
tag,
I'm
rolling
over
on
you,
big
guy.
All

little
bit.
Get

for.
Thanks.
Yeah,
you
should
thank
me.
That
girl
was
not
easy
to
find.
What,
she
scam
you
out
Nah.
Some
guy
gave
me
a
couple
bucks
to
track
down
his
high
school
girlfriend.
Stalker,

Yep.
Big

yours?
Are
you
familiar
Did
you
build
No,
just
down
the
street
the
Celinto
Catayente
Towers.
It's
quite
a
fine
example,
in
fact.
I
recommend
that
next
time
that
you
drop
in
and
take
Hey,
thanks
for
picking
me
up,
man.
Yeah,
no
problem.
I've
been
driving
for,
like,
so
I
could
use
the
company.
Yeah,
I
know
what
you
mean.
I've
been
standing
in
the
same
spot
for
five
and
a
half
hours.
You
know
they
made
it
illegal
Really?
That
must
make
it
really
tough.
So,
uh,
what's
going
on
with
you?
Uh,
no,
no,
I'm...
I'm...
I'm
nothing.
I

my
own
company.

You
walk
into
a
video
store.

I'm...
I
would
go

7-minute
abs.

it.
That's
our
motto.

to
B.
That's
right.
Unless,
of
course,
somebody
comes
up
with
6-minute
abs.
No!
No,
no,
not
six.
I
said
seven.
Nobody's
coming
up
with
six.
Who
works
out
in
six
minutes?
You
won't
even
get
your
heart
going,
not
even
a
mouse
on
a
wheel.
That...
good
point.
Seven's
the
key
number
here.

7-Elevens.
Seven
dwarves.
Seven,

the
number.

a
while
I
don't
know
why
anybody

fresh
in
a
new
place,
Slow
things
down
a
bit,
Are
you
a
movie
buff?
I
try
to
be,
but
it's
tough
going
out
there
I
just
wish
they
made
movies
You
know,
classics
or
Harold
and
Maude.
Harold
and
Maude
Don't
bust
my
chops.
Pat,
I'm
not
kidding.
I
think
that
Harold
and
Maude
love
stories
of
our
time.
Here
I
thought
I
was
the
only
one.
You're
too
good
to
be
true.
