Doesn't

Doesn't

He's

Look

get
screwed.
Thanks

Hello.
Who

this?
Glen
Foy?
Do
I
know
you,
Mr.
Foy?
Uh...
WelI,
I

one
of
your
scouts
You
fired
me,
actualIy.
WeIl,
you
brought
Oh,
you
don't?
So
why
are
you
calling
me
Sorry.
I'm
in
CaIifornia.
I've
just
seen
a
young
player.
-
Who
does
he
pIay
for?
The
point
is,
I'm
on
a
plane
home
tomorrow
If
he
turns
up
on
your
doorstep,
-
You
want
me
to
promise
you
this,
right?
Just
give
him
a
run
out.
If
I
say
yes,
can
I
go
back
to
sleep?
Yes,
Mr.
DornheIm.
Then
yes,
Mr.
Foy.
-
Santiago.
-
How
are
you
doing?
Your
coach
told
me
where
to
find
you.

If
you
get
yourseIf
to
EngIand,
Newcastle
United?
-
That's
a
big
club.

He
thinks
I'm
good
enough.
Why
you
fiIl
him
with
ideas
like
this?
Who
the
heIl
do
you
think
you
are?
And
you.
Why
don't
you
keep
your
feet
on
Vamonos.
It's
a
big
thing
you
ask,
senor.
He's
supposed
to
fly
halfway
The
manager's
made
me
a
promise.
-
Look
in
my
eyes
and
answer
me
this.
Can
Santi
make
it
as
a
professional?
Aye,
I
believe
he
can.
Dad.
We've
gotta
go.
If
the
freeway's
busy,
Here's
my
card.
Think
about
it.
Give
me
a
ring.
It's
good
to
meet
you.
Good
to
see
you.
You
got
enough?
-
Enough
what?
So
are
you
going?
-
Grandma
thinks
I
should.
I
haven't
asked
him.
How
far
away
is
England?
Right
now?
400
bucks
too
far.
Go
back
to
sIeep.
Now.
Apurate,
carajo.
There?
Thanks.
How
couId
you
do
this,
Dad?

You
knew
what
it
was
for.
-
Two
more
weeks
and
I
have
enough.
To
chase
a
stupid
dream?
Big-time
baIlplayer
in
EngIand.
And
when
you
fail,
how
are
you
One
chance,
and
you
think
I
should
What
I
do
is
take
care
of
my
family.
In
Mexico,
I
work
construction!
But
I
save
enough
to
bring
us
to
America.
And
when
your
mother
walk
out
on
us...
-
I
hold
this
family
together.
I
make
enough
for
this
house
That's
how
things
get
better!
It's
your
life!
Not
mine.

Somewhere

how

to
Newcastle?
.
When
you've
waited
for
so
long
.
To
be
where
you
are
.
And
where
you're
coming
from
Hey.
How's
it
going?
Why
didn't
you
caIl
me
from
LA?
-
Is
it
OK
that
I'm
here?
Just
caught

a
bit
off
guard,
that's
aIl.
Well,
you'd

Thank

Do

My

She

Oh,
it's...
She
has
it
since
she's
a
IittIe
girI.
I'm
not
much
of
a
Catholic,
mind.
She
thinks
you're
a
good
man,
so...
Santiago,
your
dinner's
ready.
Santiago.

.
Here's
a
thought
for
every
man
.
What's
in
his
hands
.
He
walks
along
an
open
road
.
Surviving
if
he
can
.
Bound
with
all
the
weight
.
Chained
to
all
the
places
.
Bound
with
all
the
weight
.
As
he
faced
the
sun,
he
cast
no
shadow
I
thought
you
worked
in
football.
Not
anymore.
I
was
finished
a
while
back,
-
You
fix
'em?
Listen,
there'lI
not
be
anyone
So
why
don't
you
get
yourself
something
-
Yeah.
No.
But
I'm
OK.
-
No,
I
can't.
Take
it.
Turn
right.
Just
for
now.

Here,
mate,
watch
the
balI.
Oh,
no.
Hey,
mister,
can
we
have
wor
ball
back?
-
Quite
tasty.
-
I'm
done.
Sorry.
Here.
I
hear
some
players
-
Divvent
Iike
his
attitude.
Well,
three
clubs
in
five
years
I
think
he's
better
playing
on
the
inside.
If
he's
in
a
mood,
he
gets
lost
out
wide.
Aye,
right
enough,
like.
What
are
you
looking
at?
Sorry,
but
you're
-
No.
Oh,
aye.
Yeah.
-
Where
are
you
from,
son?
Oh,
aye?
You
know
Charlize
Theron?
-
What
are
you
doing
up
here?
-
A
triaI,
like?
Howay.
Yeah,
yeah.
Maybe
today,
actually.
You
wanna
lay
off
the
bIack
pudding,
son.
-
What
is
it
exactly?
FootbaIl's
a
reIigion
here.
London
has
any
Manchester,
you've
got
two,
Liverpool,
Up
here,
though,
it's
just
the
Toon.
There
she
is.
-
Is
that
the
manager?
He
can
be
intimidating.
I
don't
think
my
look
wilI
make
a
difference.
-
It'lI
be
my
feet.
This
is
the
young
man

my
father
believes
You

your
family.
You

And
it's
foolish
to
think
otherwise.
-
Excuse
me,
sir...
He
said
I
couId
come
in
and
just
Iook
Mr.
Dornhelm.
Listen,
I'm
sorry
Have
I
missed
alI
the
boring
speeches?
I'm
making
one
of
the
"boring"
speeches.
Well,
if
you'd
answered
my
calls,
-
What
do
you
want?
-
Would
you
like
to
sit
here?
Listen,
he's
grown
up
and
his
only
way
out
He's
fIown
6,000
miIes
on
my
say-so.
He's
jet-lagged.
He's
nervous.
You
know,
he's
never
seen
mud
before.
And
then
you
spend
-
I
saw
him
flat
on
his
ass
most
of
the
time.
When
he
took
the
ball
on
the
bounce.
-
Turned
Magowan.
Took
it
down.
Looks
good.
Listen,
when
I
was
a
scout,
I
used
to
spend
the
whole
time,
watching
young
lads
and
just
once
in
a
whiIe,
there'd
be
one
Like
this
lad.
Just
give
him
a
month.

Ah,
so
you
found
aIl
my
yesterdays?
I
was
just
looking.
My
wife
made
this
scrapbook.
You
never
told
me
Aye.
WelI,
not
for
as
long
as
I'd
have
liked.
-
Why?
Look
at
that.
Didn't
make
£8
milIion
a
year,
either.
-
But
you
were
still
heroes.
FootbaIlers
have
aIways
been
heroes,
and
working
down
the
mine
-
There
you
go.
I'm
not
giving
it
to
you.
I
want
to
see
what
you
Iook
like
-
What's
the
point?
Well,
you've
got
a
month's
trial.
Better
phone
your
granny
again.

Right,
Iisten
up,
you

-
No.

Santi,
I've

son.
But

Come

Thank

Do

high.
Well,
'cause
you
are
so
cIose
It's
normal.
-
Are
you
the
club
doctor?
-
Did
you
fill
in
the
paperwork?
Just
a
couple
of
words
I
didn't
understand.
OK.
Like
what?
Like
this
one
here.
That's
"cardiovascular."
Oh.
No.
No.
And
how
about
that
one?
"Respiratory"
-
do
you
have
any
problems
Do
you?
No.
Do
you
wanna
step
on
the
scales?
Right.
-
What's
your
name?

I
mean
your
first
name.
You
don't
need
to
know
where
I
live,
or
what
I'm
doing
on
Saturday
night.
-
I'm
gonna
have
to
take
bIood.
But

Knobhead?
Knobhead?

How

the

Here.
Look
at
this.
Finished
with
that,
son?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Santi.

There
you

Hey,
listen.
Tonight.
Go

Bevvy.
Women.
Yeah.
Uh...

Identification?
How
oId
do
you
have
to
be
here
Eleven.
AlI
right,
Gavin!
Listen,
mate,
if
you
want
an
autograph,
Listen,
Elvis,
I'm
with
the
club
too.
I've
never
seen
you
before.
I
don't
go
out
much.
Hey!
Hey!
-
Hi.
No
way.
It's
fulI
of
posers,
that
place.
-
Yeah?
Where
are
you
going?
-
What
do
you
say?
Here
we
go,
here
we
go.
Canny
wine,
this
Rioja.
It's
from
-
No,
I'm
from
LA.
LA?
And
Merseyside?
-
Well...
I
thought
you
said
players
were
off
Iimits.
Relax.
They
haven't
made
the
reserves
yet.
Well,
as
long
as
you're
mired
in
mediocrity,
I'm
sorry,
but
I
don't
know
what
that
means.
It
means
don't
change.
Well,
my
life's
aIready
changed,
I
grew
up
on
a
council
estate
with
a
dad
Change
is
fine
with
me.
I
remember
you
now.
-
You're
the
one
with
the
toe.
You
had
fungus
behind
your
big
toenail.
-
What?
Did
you
have
to
mention
that?
I
guess
in
your
job,
-
I
know
what
you're
gonna
say.
-
OK,
what
were
you
gonna
ask?
It
must
be
you,
because
she
cannot
tell
us.
-
Go
on.
Come
on.
Space,
hit
space.
Stick
with
him.
-
Remember
what
I
told
you.
OK,
pass.
Pass
the
balI.
Pass
it.
Why
didn't
you
pass
the
ball,
man?
-
Hey,
Mal.
Munez.
Come
here.

Hey,
lads.
Over
here.
Hey,
MaI.
Give
me
five
minutes.
-
OK,
boss.
So
when
I
say
go,
I
want
you
-
OK?
Go.
Come
back.
Again.
Go.
What
did
you
learn?
-
That
you
can
score
from
haIfway.
That
the
ball
can
travel
faster
than
you.
Here,
we
pass
the
baIl.
We're
a
unit,
not
a
one-man
show.
The
name
on
the
front
of
the
shirt
is
-
OK?
-
Santi.



This
is
the
final
Only
three
games
left
this
season,
in
the
Champions
League,
they'll
have
to
win
them
all
-
starting
today.
Oh,
man.
Never
an
easy
team
to
beat,
Chelsea.
-
Well-coached,
weIl-drilled.
The
game,
yeah.
I'm
with
Gavin's
girIfriend.
Lads.

Toon,
Toon!
Toon,
Toon!
Black
and
white
army!
.
The
color
quits
and
all
invade
us
.
There
it
goes
again,
.
All
I
got
is
a
dirty
trick
.
I'm
chasing
down
the
walls
to
save
ya
.
I
tell
you
I
wanted
you
.
I
tell
you
I
needed
you
.
The
blood
ain't
on
my
face
How's
that
possible?

For
alI
their
possession,
Newcastle
haven't
yet
created
-
He's
fading.
By
a
briIliant
sense
of
positional
pIay,
-
Well,
maybe
he's
playing
hurt.
-
Right,
get
him
off.
Now,
this
looks
quite
bad
for
NewcastIe.
They've
already
got
Number
ten
off,
mate.

Wait
a
second.
What?
Me?
He's
taking
Gavin
off.
What
are
you
thinking
about,

Substitution
for
Newcastle
United.
-
What
are
you
doing?

Only
five
minutes
Chelsea
still
have
the
upper
hand.


Goal!
And
it's
Patrick
Kluivert.
-
Evening,
Mr.
DornheIm.

Yeah!
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
No,
no,
no,
no.
I
got
great
news.
I
made
the
reserve
squad.
-
Oh,
that's
great.
This
game
is
make-or-break.
If
the
boss
-
I'm
sure
he
will.
-
Yeah.
OK.
They'll
aIl
be
asking
Will
that
bother
you?
I
don't
have
a
problem
with
footbalI.
It's
my
dad's
fauIt.
He
was
in
a
rock
band
-
No
way.
WouId
I
know
him?
Anyway,
the
point
is,
One
minute
they're
nice,
and
the
next
they're
ridiculously
rich
It
was
my
mother
who
left
mine.
-
Why?
What
happened?
AlI
I
remember
He's
never
seen
me
play.
I
love
that
game.
Love
football.
Every
night
after
school
AlI
I
hoped
was
that
one
day,
Why
did
you
have
to
come
so
far
For
that,
you
have
to
ask
the
saints.
Why
don't
you
telI
him,
Grandma?

TeIl
him
about
the
game.
Ey-up,
lads.
Dagger's
hamstring
is
holding
up,
Santiago,
I
want
you
on
the
right
flank.
Track
the
number
eight.
-
I'Il
translate
that
for
you
later.
I
want
you
to
slot
in
behind
the
two
strikers.
Remember,
don't
Iet
'em
-
Howay.

Let's
kick
some
arse,
fellas!
Come
on,
boys!

What's
that?
What's
wrong
with
him?

Right!
Let's
have
a
look!
Jackie,
how
are
we?
Here,
mate.
Do
you
wanna
put

You
all

-
I
think
that's
enough.
OK.
Go
and
get
yourself
an
early
bath,
son.
What's
the
matter?
Been
out
on
the
town?
Is
there
something
OK.
I
don't
know,
Santi.
I
know
you've
got
the
skiIl.
But
maybe
you
don't
have
the
pace
Maybe
you'd
be
better
off
I'm
gonna
have
to
let
you
go,
son.
-
Yes?
Rosie,
it's
for
you.
Oh,
God.
Are
you
the
young
man
from
LA?
Yes.
Santiago.

Can
I
get

anything,
pet?
I
went

years
ago
We
stayed
at
the
Hyatt
House
on
Sunset.
-
Aren't
you
meeting
your
friends?
Nice
to
meet
you,
Santiago.
Nice
to
meet
you,
ma'am.
-
I
love
that
name.
-
What's
wrong?
At
the
physical.
-
I
have
asthma.
If
I
had,
they
wouldn't
have
given
me
a
triaI.
-
So
telI
them
now.
-
They
fired
me.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
came
to
say
goodbye.
-
You're
Ieaving?
-
Why
so
soon?
Well,
you
can
find
another
team.
I
guess
I
was
just...
I
was
just
dumb
to
think
-
Worst
thing
is
I've
Iet
peopIe
down.
-
Who,
pet?
My
grandma.
My
grandma.
This
happens
to
players
all
the
time.
It's
part
and
parcel
of
the
game.
No.
We...
We
hardly
know
each
other.
Shit!

Aren't
