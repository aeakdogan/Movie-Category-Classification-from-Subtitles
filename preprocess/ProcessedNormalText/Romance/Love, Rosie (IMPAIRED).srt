Take
a
deep
breath
Tell
them
how
we
first
met.
-
Hi.
FEMALE
TEACHER:
Alex
Stewart?
ROSIE:
Tell
them
that
ever
since
we
shared
our
dreams...
-
Yeah!
ALEX:
I
had
a
dream
last
night.
...even
Alex's
weirdest
ones.
You
know
a
rowing
boat?
That
little
curvy
-
It's
called
a
rollock,
by
the
way.
Rollock,
like
"bollock"
with
an
"R."
That
was
me.
No.
Keep
that
as
our
secret.
Rosie?
Tell
them
that
this
is,
that
this
has
to
be...

Everybody!
...one
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
life.
Please!
For
those
I
haven't
I'm
Rosie.

And
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
life.

Shots!
ALEX:
Yeah!
Beyoncé!
Yeah!

ROSIE:
Whoa!



GARY:
Hi,
Alex.
-
GARY:
All
right.
GARY:
It's
Alex!
It
was
totally
my
fault,
the
whole
thing.
Oh,
I'd
love
to
believe
you,
Alex,
I
just
happen
to
know
A
fine
doctor
you're
gonna
make
if
this
is
how
you
carry
on.
Why
is
everybody
shouting?

I'm
so
embarrassed
about
last
night.
No,
no,
you
don't
have
to
be.
Ugh,
I
behaved
so
badly!

Yeah,
but
bad
can
be
good,
too.
Good?
It
was
awful.
About
which
part?
All
of
it.
Alex,
OK?

Right.

I

didn't

she
thinks
I'm

Bethany

I

your

She's

just
wondering
why
you
haven't
squeezed
that

Fuck
off!
Don't
touch
me!



Ow!
ALEX:
Just
look
at
Greg
right
now.
Seriously
hot,
though.
He
invited
me
to

Uh,
what
did
you
say?
No,
obviously.

BETHANY:
Hey,
Alex.
I
missed
you
in

Yeah,
uh,
I
had
nothing...
Uh,
I
mean,
yeah.
Don't
be
a
stranger.

Yeah.
Yeah,
absolutely
not.
I'll
see
you
there.

Hey,
girls!
Pathetic.
She's
mine
for
the
taking.
You're
lucky
she
didn't

halfway
across
the
ground.
Whoa.
OK.
Well,
give
me
some
tips
then,
How
do
I
go
about
who
is
apparently
-
Is
that
a
serious
question?
Mmm,
well,
you're
at
a
disadvantage
being
a,
you
know,

virgin.

We
can
work
with
that.
First
you
have
to
be
cool.
Act
like
you
could
-
You
see,
that
I've
had
practice
at.
Uh,
second,
you
have
to
make
her
feel
like
you've
seen
something
Like
her
soul.
While
also
ignoring
her?
Yes.

This
is
about
the
sex!
God!
You're
so
fucked
up.
Mmm.

She
wants
me
to
Really?
Yeah,
imagine.

Take
her,
if
it
means
Come
on.
Uh...
I
got
asked
by
the
fittest
I
think
I'm
fine.
What,
Yeah.
All
right.
Go
for
it.
OK.
Fine,
I
will.

Bethany?
Bethany,
hi.
Yeah!




Come
on.

ROSIE:
Me,
too.
I
need
to
concentrate
so
and
get
a
life.




Not
Bethany!
Fuck!
Right,
Rosie
Dunne,
No,
no,
no,

So
I
see,
Alex.

-
BOY:
Yes,
Alex!

I
know
we're
not
officially
talking,
but
I
need
help
with
my
tie.
For
a
minute
there,
in
love
with
me
or
something.
Alex,
you
will
forever
be
the
boy
who
wiped
bogeys
-

Good.
I
know
boy-girl
friendships
can
be
quite
complicated
sometimes,
but
you
know

What
do
you
think?
Boobs
au
naturel
or
pushed
up?
In?
Or
out?

Well,
uh,
I
mean,
it
depends.

Hmm.
Who
knows?
ALEX:
So,
where
is
this
tool
ROSIE:
You're
so
rude!
Uh,
yes...
Hey,
gorgeous.
Oh.

See
ya!

Wanker.

OK.
Fuck!

Oh,
just...

-
You
have
done
this
before?
It's
like
brushing
my
teeth.

Ahhh!
Bollocks!

-
That's...
Look,
let
me
help
you...
OK,
I've
got
it.
OK,
quick!
Here
we
go!

Sweet
Jesus!


Oh.

Wow.
I
know.


Mmm.
OK.
-
Where
is
it?
-
The
thing.
Seriously,
Greg,
where
is
it?
You
had
it!
Look,
it
can't
have
just
disappeared!
Oh,
God!

GREG:
Rosie?

Do
you
want

to

off!

Rosie!
I'm
on

No,
wait,
you've
got
to
help
me,
there's
been
an
accident!
Christ,
what?
No,
no,
no,
sorry,
no,
Jesus,
you
scared
me!
I
mean,
there
was
an
accident,
um,
-
Well,
that
happens,
Rosie!
Something
that
I
need
to
get
rid
of
it.
It
got
lost
and
I
can't
find
it
You're
not
making
any
sense,
Rosie!
Can
we
just
talk
ROSIE:
No,
Alex,
please!
OK,
you
need
to
be
really
clear
OK!
The
condom
came
and
at

That's
way
more
information
Hi.
Of
course
you
are.
OK.
Is
it,
um,
front
bottom
or
back?
What
do
you
think
I
am?
Sorry.
I
wasn't
suggesting
you're
a
slag

Isn't
there
a
female
nurse?
I'm
afraid
I'm
all
you've
got.
Huh.

That
was
one
of
the
Moments
of
my
entire

Oh.
-
Oh.
You
know
what?
Let's
get
out
of
here.
Dino's
should
still
be
open.
I
was
thinking
more
Boston,
Massachusetts.
Oh,
you
think
I
should
flee
the
country?
I'm
serious.
This
place
is
a
dead
end,
we've
been
saying
it
for
years.
And,
uh,
my
dad
wants
me
to
You
are
serious.
It's
one
of
the
best
medical
schools
And
Boston
College
happens
to
have
a
really
great
hotel
management
course.

That
is
what
you
You
can't!
I
mean,
who'll
do
your
washing?
You'll
never
eat!
They
have
food
in
America,
Mum,
and
I'm
guessing
washing
machines.
ALICE:
It's
so
far
away!
I
mean,
talk
to
her,
Dennis!
It
works
for
me.
I
know,
but
Mum's
just
being
Mum.
It
would
be
so
much
fun,
ROSIE:
Did
you
ever
want
more,
Dad?
Do
you
know
"Not
for
the
likes
of
us."
When
you
told
us
of
your
plan,
it
was
the
first
thing
I
could
hear
her
voice
I
don't
want
that
voice
Here,
let
me.
I
want
my
own
Is
it
crazy
to
think
like
that?

I've
been
winging
it
pretending
I
was
the
one
in
charge.
You're
amazing,
Rosie.
There's
nothing
you
can't
do,
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it.
But
if
I
go
to
Boston,
Well,
if
you
don't
go,
I
won't.
The
choice
is
yours.
Dennis!
And
do
me
a
favour.
Come
back
and
take
that
prick's
job.

Good
evening!
"Dear
Miss
Dunne,
congratulations!

are
pleased
to
offer
you

seat

my

hey,

in?

tied
up.
I
can
come
back.

be
down
in

of
tea?


BETHANY:
Baby!
Oh,
baby!

Oh,
yeah.
Yeah,
baby,
show
me,
come
on,
baby!

Yeah,
yeah...
Oh,
my
God,
is...
-
Is
that?
So,
when
you
said
he
was...
-
Tied
up.
Tied
up.
-
Um,
I
should
go.

-
BETHANY:
Oh,
Alex.
-
Where
did
you
learn
-
to
do
that?
-



I
know.


Hello?

WOMAN:
Fuck!
I'm
coming!
Are
you
supposed
to
smoke
in
here?
My
parents
own
the
place.
What's
up?
Oh,
right.
Maybe
you
could
-
Any
diarrhoea?
-
Fever?
-
Stomach
cramps?
Well,
have
you
missed
a
period?
Yeah.
-
Uh,
no.
No,
but
I
took
the
morning-after
pill!
90%
safe.
10%
is
the
catch.
There's
a
loo
here

ROSIE:
Fuck,
fuck,
fuck!
Bollocks.


ALEX:
I'd
love
to,
but
Bethany's
parents
are
taking
us
out
to
dinner
at
the
Hazel.
How
posh
is
that?




OK.
I'm
sorry.
Um,
I...
I...
I've
got
news.
-
Me,
too.
Scholarship
to
Harvard!
Alex,
that's
so
great.
It's
unbelievable,
right?
Have
you
heard
back
No.

Yeah,
you'll
get
in.
Yeah,
what
about
Bethany?
She'll
be
fine.
She's
got
this...
-
Yeah.
And
she
pulls
-
Enough.
Enough...
Don't
you
care
what
about
you
rushing
off
like
this?
All
right,
what
is
it?
What?
Well,
you're
defending
Bethany.
Nothing.
I
thought
you'd
be
happier.

We're
on
our
way
to
Boston!
It's
great.
Well
done.
What,
come
on,
My
flight's
in
three
days,
which
gives
me
time
to
get
settled
in
You
need
to
go
ahead
Sure.
I
have
got
some
but
I'll
be
there.

-
Don't
get
blown
up
by
terrorists.
Or
lose
cabin
pressure
-
Rosie,
wait,
wait,
wait...
I
can
delay,
if
you
need
me
to.
No.
I've
got
you
something.
Close
your
eyes.
Give
me
your
finger.
North
America.

Keep
in
touch,
OK?
OK.
See
you
in
two
weeks,
so...
Boston.
This
way?
ROSIE:
If
I'd
told
him,
and
his
whole
life
I
mean,
what's
the
point?

How
noble.
Oh,
no,
no.
That's
just
some
other
loser.

You
are
turning
out
to
be
a
lot
more
interesting
than
you
look.
Why
don't
you
just
My
parents
are
Catholic.
Oh,
I
had
it
all
sussed!
Move
to
Boston,
study,
get
a
great
job,
at
27,
come
back
and
open
a
hotel.
Then
get
married
and
have
kids.
Wow.
A
whole
life
in
bullet
points.
Yeah,
well
now,
it's
pregnant,
have
sprog,
full-time
mother,
wave
goodbye
to
career,
Yeah.
You
might
as
well
-
I
can
sort
the
drugs.
Look.
There's
loads
of
people
out
there
Give
it
away.
I
could
still
move
to
Boston.

I
can
apply
to
college
again,
or
get
a
job.
So
it
would
all
be
the
same,
I
don't
even
need
to
tell
Alex,
I
could
just
think
of
an
excuse.
Whoa.
Yeah.
I
just
happen
to
think

-
ALICE:
Who's
that?
ALICE:
Have
you
told
him
yet?
I'm
sending
him
my
That's
all
he
needs
to
know.
Oh.
All
this
fibbing
is
gonna

Whoa!
The
way
that
thing
-
That
might
happen
to
you!
Her
whole
belly
will
erupt.
Blood
and
guts.
And
this
freakish
alien
will
leap
out
-

Pregnancy
is
a
sacred
thing!
-
It
can't
hear
us.
And
don't
refer
to
it
as
"it."
It's
a
girl
if
you
must
know.
You
found
out?
I
asked
at
the
last
scan.
I
thought
I
should
tell
the
social
worker
A
girl!
No,
um,
I'll
let
the
new
parents
decide.
-
Give
us
a
peek.

woman's

my

at
that!
Oh,

hiccups!

Little
thing's

breath

this.

not

the
midwife?
Come
in

Come
on!

on!

down
the
hallway.

Get
out!

a

sucks!

her
straight
downstairs?

promise,

going
to
be
a
good
mummy.

pumps,

them.
Oh,

nightmare.
Oh,
God.
How
did
you...
Bethany.
Fast
work.
I
was
gonna
tell
you,
Alex,
I
promise.
When?
I
didn't
want
to
hold
you
back.
ROSIE:

had
colic
for
months.
My

All
I
can

about
is
poo.
How
much,
when,
what

happened
to

got

me.
Oh!
Love
you.
Love
you,
too.
You
dreamt
you
were
Yeah,
I
mean,
come
on.
That's
pretty
cool.
I
don't
understand.
I
don't
know.
It
sounds
to
me
You
may
need
to
talk
to
someone.
You
know,
there
are
razor
hairs
in
the
bathroom,
again
today.
Really?
You
know
it
gives
me
allergies.
Next
time
you
have
one
maybe
you
should
dream
you're
something
useful
We
have
a
cleaning
lady.
What
do
you
want?
For
her
to
think
we're
That's
exactly
what
we
are.

ROSIE:
Whoo!

-
You
OK?
-

Look
at
Mummy!


ALEX:
I
dreamt
I
was
an
arrow.


What
have
you
That
you're
coming
home
with
a
dad?
No!
Just
that
he
sent
me
a
ticket.
Well,
good,
because
Although
you
know
it's
funny,
Yeah,
well,
Katie's
that
when
it
comes
to
men,
Yeah,
well,
Katie
also
knows
that
something
must
have
triggered
his
sudden
enthusiasm
who,
by
the
way,
and
is
clearly
the

Oh,
and,
uh...


All
right!
All
right!
So,
tired?
No.
Why?
-



Come
on.
Do
you
want
another?
Um,
yeah.
All
right.
So,
you're
new
here.
Rosie!
Rosie?
I'm
a
Mum!
Is
that
some
kind
of,
uh,
performance
thing?
I'm
a
mother
of
Cool!
Cool!
Um...
Can
I
get
you
a
drink
or
something?
-
A
gin
and
tonic.
-
Cell?
Car
keys?
Guys,
guys,
guys,
no,
no,
no!
MAN:
Yup.
It's
happening!
-
It's
gonna
happen!
-
BOTH:
One,
two,
three!
Rosie,
Rosie,
come
on,
come...


Can
you
give
me
a
hand?
All
right.


Come
on.
Come
on!
Oh.
You're
looking
way
too

Come
on,
all
right,
OK.
ROSIE:
No,
no,
no!

ALEX:
You
stink.
You
haven't
bathed.
-
Bananas?

-
All
right.
-
Any
good?
Catch.

All
right.
"You
will
live
a
long
Oh,
can
I
switch?
-
'Cause
you
prefer
mine?
I
do,
I
do.
I
don't
know
Well,
you
do
go
here,
so
you
probably
ROSIE:
Strange
to
think
and
been
part
of
it.
But
I
don't
regret
Katie,
you
know?
I
mean,
how
could
I?
She's
the
most
amazing
kid.

The
weird
thing
is
that
she
reminds
me
That's
probably
just
'cause
I
love
her.
We
should
go.
Yeah.
ALEX:
Seriously
cute.
It
was
a
ball
of
fluff.

No,
seriously.
Sally.
Rosie,
Sally.
Good
morning.
Hi.
Wow.
Oh,
it's
nothing.
Just
quail
egg
and
asparagus
in
filo
pastry
with
a
Well,
my
regular
is
baked
beans.

Good
old
British
baked
bean.
Zero
nutritional
value.
Yeah.

Oh,
you
know
I
can't
drink.
Of
course.
But
how
are
we
going
to
cope
Why
can't
you
drink?
If
that's
not
a
rude
question?
Alex?
What?



Didn't...
Didn't...
Alex
and
I
are
pregnant.
Twelve
and
a
half
weeks
in.
That's
wonderful.

Congratulations.
Alex,
you
didn't
tell
me?
No,
I...

Sorry,
That's...

Oh!
Let
me
help!
-
ROSIE:
Shit!
Daddy's
antique
table!
-
Oh,
bollocks.
-
Oh,
fuck!


PHIL:
Oh,
Oh.

Look
what
you
made
me
do.
It's
fine.
We
have
Herb's
vernissage
Everything
is
gonna
be
fine.




I'm
so
sorry.
Sally
had
this
planned
for
weeks.
It's
not
for
long,
OK?
Sweetie?
Dr.
Jones
is
-
Look,
he's
just...
But
he's
a
senior
thoracic
surgeon,
Alex.
She's
right,
Alex.
Go
on.
OK,
let's
go.
HERB:
This
image
here
How
to
articulate
when
you
see
something
It's
a
little
like
love
at
first
sight.
Stops
you
in
your
tracks.
Suddenly
you
recognise
it
A
load
of
bollocks.


Rosie!
Rosie,
where
are
you
going?
Back
home.
And
I
mean
England.
I
walked
straight
Look,
it's
all
fine,
honestly.
Sally
and
I
just
needed
Oh,
good,
I'm
glad
you're
fine,
We
were
out
together
And
all
the
while
-
And
you
didn't
say!
Nothing
happened,
we
were
just...
We
were
just
having
some
fun.
That's
what
you
got
me
I
wanted
to
see
you!
Or
maybe
you
needed
someone
-
What
truth?
This
whole
situation
is
Me?
And
you're
in
denial!
You're
projecting!
OK,
can
we
just
stop
and
just
talk
like
English
people,
please!
Fine!
Fine!
Fine.
Fine.
Look.
I
was
worried
you
might
find
it
hard,
-
Hard?
and
seeing
where
we
live,
you
know,
our
apartment,
our
lifestyle,
it's
just...
OK!
You
thought
I
was
jealous
of
you?
No.
I
pity
you,
Alex!
All
I
see
is
someone
compensating
by
schmoozing
his
way
up
the
career
ladder!
Crap
personal
life?
All
right,
let's
see.
Um,
stable
lots
in
common,
a
great
circle
of
friends,
a
kid
on
the
way,
by
the
way,
not
one!
Rosie,
come
on,
I...
Forget
it,
Alex!
Go
ahead
and
climb
your
greasy
pole!
You
know,
I
will!
Just
don't
come
whinging
to
me
when
you
realise
you're
empty
inside.
-
No
danger
of
that!
-
Excellent!




Oh,
no!
Pleased
to
see
me?
What
are
you
doing
here?
You
sent
me
Katie's
drawing!
I
got
on
the
first
flight
I
could!
No!
No,
no,
no!
Katie
drew
the
picture,
I
never
expected
you
That
letter
really
made
I
wanna
meet
her,
Dad?
And
what
precisely
qualifies
you
for
that
title?
Those?
Where
were
you,
Dad,
when
she
woke
up
Or
cut
her
first
tooth,

Has
anyone
ever
told
you,

Look,
I'm
sorry,
OK?
I
get
it,
I
bailed
on
you.
But
there
hasn't
been
a
single
day
that
I
haven't
wondered
Is
she
like
me?
You're
so
full
of
shit!

You
have
to
give
I
can
be
different,
I
promise.
Do
you
want
me
to
crawl
Anything,
Rosie!
Just
get
up,
you
idiot!
Look.
If
this
were
about
me,
You'd
be
right
to.
One
chance!
One
chance,
And
you
be
nice!
And
I
don't
just
I
mean

Christmas-Easter
Bunny-

Yeah.
the
most
expensive
pair
I'm
gonna
Google
them
right
now.

GREG:
Woo-hoo!
-
Hi-five!

Whoo!
Wait
a
minute.

Hey!
This
is
a
man
who
let
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
with
a
condom
stuck
up
your
fanny!
-
He's
Katie's
dad.
You
should
see
her
little
face
light
up
They're
really
bonding!
Of
course,
none
of
that
would
matter
He's
really
worked
on
that
thing.
You're
evil,
Rosie
Dunne.
I
just
want
to
belong
I'm
tired
of
waiting.
And
it
feels
good
with
him.
We're
a
family.

RUBY:
Can
you
just
stop
ROSIE:
I'm
just
checking
everyone's
here.
Everyone
being
who,
exactly?
How's
the
blushing
bride?
Like
a
mad
bunny.
OK.
OK.
Oh.
Don't
take
this
the
But
if
there's
any
part
We'll
walk
straight
out
of
here,
So
you
like
Greg,
then?
Come
on.




Do
you
like
this?
Katie,
would
you
please?
Mum!
Sorry.

SALLY
ON
PHONE:
Hello?
Rosie.
What
can
I
do
for
you?
Um,
is
Alex
there?
Did
he
not
tell
you?
Tell
me
what?
Alex
and
I
separated.
What?
About
eight
weeks
ago?
Pretty
much

my
water
just
broke!
Oh,
God!
Wait,

No,
I

the

It's
happening!
It's
coming!








ROSIE:
Katie!

Mum!
The
music!
Can't
hear
you!
-
Don't
do
that!
Is
that
lipstick
you're
wearing?
Privacy,
Mum!
Please!
OK!

ROSIE:
Now,
have
you
-

Um,
what
about
cash?
Phone
chargers?
Rosie,
it's
fine.
-
Yes.
-
Good
bye!
-
Get
in.
-
Bye!
BOTH:
Bye.
ROSIE:
So
my
parents
have
sold
up
while
I
get
to
stay
at
home,
Nagging
a
12-year-old
about
lipstick.
I
mean,
seriously,
of
how
fucked
up
my
life
is?
Bethany?
BETHANY:
Rosie
Dunne!
You
work
here
now?
-
I
just
got
promoted
to
reception.
Congratulations!
But
you!
I've
just
flown
from
Morocco,
tomorrow
I
fly
out
again,

York,
Boston,
Chicago,

-
The
heart
bleeds.
Boston?
Really?
Alex
Stewart?
Of
course.
Great!
I'll
get
his
Thanks.
Oh.
Could
I
have
some
Evian
It's
the
only
water
I
can
drink.
Three
bottles.
-

That's
how
fucked-up
your
life
is.


ROSIE:
Mum!
How
is
Nice?

Mum,
are
you
all
right?
I'm
sorry.
I'm...

Mum,
what
is
it?
It's
bad
news
for
you.
Mum?
Mum,
what
is
it?


Hey.
Really?
Yeah.

When
I
heard,
I
was
a
fucked-up
Hero
worshipping
this


Sorry.
I
never
got
to
say
goodbye.
Hey,
come
here.
-
Hey.
Shh.
GREG:
Hey,
hey!
I've
just
been
chatting
to
your
cousin.

-
Seriously?

Ah,
'cause
Rosie,
I
mean,
You
know
what?
Please?
Thanks
for
turning
up.
Let's
go,
come
on.
ALEX:
Rosie,
you
deserve
someone
someone
who'll
always
and
who'll
love
every
part
of
you...
Mum!
I'm
not
going
All
right!
"Rosie,
you
deserve
someone
who..."
Anything
for
me?
Uh,
yeah,
just
this
one.
From
Dad.
In
France,
the
day
before
he
died.
-
Oh,
God,
don't
read
that.
Well,
it'll
upset
you.
I'm
already
upset.
Right.
Do
you
want
me
to
stay?
Funnily
enough,
no.
OK.
Well,
call
me
if
you

DENNIS:
Dear
Rosie,
I
can't
believe
it.
Here
I
am
at
last,
I've
lost
count
of
the
years
Somehow
life
got
in
the
way.
And
it
was
all
good,
but
we
forget
our
I
know
you
had
yours,
too,
and
it
must
feel
sometimes
But
I'm
so
proud
of
the
mother
you've
been
to
Katie.
What
I
once
said
there's
nothing
you
can't
do
So
keep
chasing
those
dreams,
For
my
sake,
Dad.
How
can
someone
just
Fuck
knows.

At
least
he
did
He
didn't
forget
his
dreams.
What
if
I
told
you
I
was
gonna
use
my
share
of
the
money
from
the
house
and
get
myself
a
hotel?
Somewhere
simple
but...
But
my
own
place.
I
think
that
would
be
awesome,
Mum.
ALEX:
Rosie,
I
understand
that
And
I
just
need
to
know
one
thing.
Are
you
happy
with
him?
ROSIE:
There's
not
much
somehow
we're
making
it
work.
So
I
guess
the
one
word
answer
"Yes."
-
Hey!
So
look
at
this.
That's
where
we
had
Ah.
They
just
joined
our
group.
And
I
was
just
checking
for
discounts,
and
I
found
this

That's
Greg's
name!
-
The
bridal
suite,

weekend!
He's
already
up
there
on
business.
Do
you
think...
For
our
anniversary?

It's

GREG:

Talk
later.

Bethany?
What
are
you
doing
there?
I
live
here
now.
Look
who
it
is,
Mr
Schnuffs!
Mr
Schnuffs?
Rosie?
Uh...
Hey...
Baby,
ALEX:
Yeah.
-
Schnuffie...
Um...
Bethany
and
me,
Uh,
we
thought,
um,
so,
but
then
Phil
said
no,

We're
getting
married!
The
Wedding's
next
week.
It's
fast,
but
we
need
to
fit
it
in
And
you
have
to
I
mean,
you
are
a
girl
but...
Right?
This
is
all
because
of
you,
Rosie.
It
wouldn't
have
happened
Hmm.
RUBY:
It
is
so
great
I
mean,
every
time
all
I
got
to
do
is
look
at
yours
and
it
puts
everything
into
perspective.
He
proposed
to
her
on
a
boat.

It's
like
Kate
and
Leonardo
-
The
Titanic.
How
appropriate.
Look,
Alex
is
yours,
This
is
just
proof
of
ownership.
He
wrote
that
months
ago!
-
And
anyway
he's
my
best
friend!
I'm
your
best
friend!
We
just
keep
missing
each
other-.
Maybe
we're
just
not
meant
to
be.

Right.
in
a
language
you
might
understand.

Ship.
Ship
hits
iceberg.
Mayhem,
horror,
ocean
of
ice
and
then
Alex
on
the
last
lifeboat.
One
space
left.
Or
Rosie?
Who's
it
going
to
be?

What?
Less
time,
more
outfits.
What's
this?
I
couldn't
leave
her
behind
Oh,
are
you
two
an
item
now?
-
No
way.
We're
friends.
God
give
me
strength.
-
Well,
come
on,
we're
really
late.
I
hate
arriving
early,
and
besides,
we
have
-
Um,
sorry,
what's
going
on?
I
need
to
go
to
Boston!
I'm
afraid
it's
a
five
Sir,
I
understand
your
frustration...
I
think
your
cushion
just
burst.
Slow
down!
OK,
you
guys,
get
your
stuff!
Katie
move
it!
I'm
coming,
ROSIE:
Ruby,
come
on!
KATIE:
Mum!
And
you
thought
the
You'll
have
to
get
dressed
in
the
van!

Excuse
me?
You
get
everything
-
And
you
are?
A
pleasure
to
meet
you,
Ruby.
Likewise.
Will
you
marry
me?
Yeah.
What?
That's
not...
I
think
she
wants
Well,
it
works.

-


No,
no,
you
don't
know
how
hard
it
is.

ROSIE:
Final
word
of
warning.
Alex
can
hold
his
drink
as
I
discovered
on
my
18th
birthday,
when
he
decided
a
night
-

Well,
you
know
that
the
whole
night
is
a
blank
and
you
always
go,
"No
way,
not
possible."
Well,
believe
me,
it's
possible.

Choosing
a...
Choosing
the
person
is
one
of
the
most
important
decisions
ever.
Because
when
it's
wrong,
it
turns
your
life
to
grey.
And
sometimes...
Sometimes
you
don't
even
notice
until
you
wake
up
one
morning
and
realise
years
have
gone
by.
We
both
know
about
Your
friendship
has
brought
It's
been
there
even
in
And
I
am
the
luckiest
I
hope
I
didn't
take
I
think
maybe
I
did.
Because
sometimes
you
don't
see
that
the
best
thing
is
sitting
there,
right
under
your
nose.
But
that's
fine,
too.
It
really
is.
Because
I've
realised
that
no
matter
where
you
are
or
what
you're
doing,
I
will
always
honestly,
truly.
Completely
love
you.


Like
a
sister
loves
a
brother
and
a
friend
loves
a
friend.
I'll
always
stand
guard
No
matter
how
weird
So,
please,
everybody,
join
me
in
a
toast.
To
the
bride
and
groom.
ALL:
To
the
bride
and
groom!

RUBY:
Come
on,
show
me
what
you've
got!
No,
please!
-

Here
we
go.



Baby,
baby,
what's
up?

Katie?
-
Katie
just...
Katie?
KATIE:
Mum?

What
are
you
doing
out
here?
Huh?
KATIE:
Toby
kissed
me,
Mum.
ROSIE:
Oh.
Is
that
such
a
bad
thing?
Of
course
it
is.
Hey.
Look,
I...
I
was
watching
you
two
tonight.
You're
a
team.
KATIE:
Don't
you
get
it?
It
would
be
like
you
two
I'll
just
tell
him
to
Katie,
that...
That
would
be
a
big
mistake.
Look,
if
you
reject
him
now,
he's
gonna
make
it
and
meet
the
most
perfect,
just
to
try
and
get
over
you.
And
he'll
end
up
marrying
and
spending
the
rest
And
you
know,
He
really
must
be
happy,

but
she
won't
be
you,
you
know?
But
you
two
never
actually
kissed?
-
Did
you?

TOBY:
Katie?
KATIE:
Toby!
I'm
really
sorry.
Alex?

I
only
realised,
uh,
Your
18th
birthday,
about
five
tequila
slammers
in,
I
think,
before
you
fell
off
the
stool...
So
that's
why
you
took
And
you
went
with
Greg.

Well,
bye.
OK.





ALL:
Cheers!

RUBY:
It's
so
nice.
Your
own
hotel,
darling.
Your
father
would

Babe!
Babe!

Do
you
have
a
room?
Yes,
of
course.
A
single,
for
one
night.

Welcome!
Have
we
met
before?
The
condom
came
and
at
present

I
don't
think
so.
Ruby,
would
you
please
Of
course.
And
free
champagne!
All
right,
follow
me
and
then...
Yeah,
a
brand
new
bed,
and...
It's
massive
and
you
And
it's...
It's
really
pretty.
You'll
love
it.
Uh...
Hi.
Hi...
Uh...
Hey,
guys!
KATIE:
No,
I
want
to
see
him!
I
said
out!
-
KATIE:
No,
but
I...
Um...
So,
I,
uh...
I
guess
I
need
a
room.
Any
baggage?
No.
I
left
it
behind.
So
your
wife...
Won't
be
joining
me.
We
both
knew
it
wasn't
right.
Sea
view
or
garden
view?
I...

recommend
the
sea.
Um,
sea
it
is.
One
room
with
sea
view.
Um,
Ruby
would
you
mind
to
his
room?
Please.
Sorry,
chief,
Um,
please,
follow
me.


So,
I
had
this
weird
dream
Let
me
guess,
-

you
were,
um,
a
valve
in
that
blow
cold
air
on
you?
No.
No,
uh...
I
was
me.
And
you
were
you,
standing
where
you
And
I
took
you
in
my
arms,

Like
this.
And
said,
"Rosie
Dunne,

Better
late
than
never.
