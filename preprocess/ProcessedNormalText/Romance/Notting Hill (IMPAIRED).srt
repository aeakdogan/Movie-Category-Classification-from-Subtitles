now

The
radical

And
then,
suddenly,
and
from

of
day
hundreds
filling
Portobello
Road,
And
wherever
you
look
thousands
of
some
genuine

And
what's
great
is
that
lots

That's

And

That's
right.
I
am
at

I
just
wanna
be
sure
-
What
are
the
choices?
First
there's
this
one.
Yeah,

Get
your

Um,
can
I
help
you
at
all?
No,

Fine.

either
wipe

see
you
in
a

I'm
sorry
about
that.
No,
it's
fine.
I
was
gonna
steal
one,
Oh,
signed
by
the
author,

yeah,
couldn't
stop
him.
If
you
can
find
an
unsigned
one,

Yes?
Uh,

you
want
my
phone
number?
But...
no.
I
will
take
this

-
No,
no,
no.
Would
be
exciting,
though,
Do
you
know--
but
I
once
saw
Ringo
Starr.
-
Where
was
that?
At
least
I
think
it
was
Ringo.
It
might
have
been
that
man

You
know,
Toppy.
Yes,
that's
right.
Mm-hmm.
Actually,
Ringo

Ah,

The
whole

fire

Uh--
The
film's
great,
and,
um,
I
just
was
wondering
whether...
you
ever
thought
of
having,
um,
more,
uh,
horses
in
it.

Uh,
well,
we
would
have
liked
to,
but
it
was,
um,
difficult,
Space,
right,
yeah.
I'm
so
sorry.
They
thrust
this
thing
No,
it's
my
fault.
I
just
wanted
to
sort
of
apologize

seriously
don't
know

I
just
wanted
to
make
sure
-
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Absolutely
fine.

remember
that
Miss
Scott
is

takes
place

submarine.
Oh.

be
riding
them...

would
you
be
getting,
a--

I--
I'm
a
complete
moron.
This
is
very
weird.
It's

in

mean,
good
dreams.
it's
a
dream,
in
fact,
What
happens
next
in
the
dream?
I
suppose
in
the,
uh,
dream--
dream
scenario--
change
my
personality...
because
you
can
do
that
walk
over
and,
uh,
kiss
the
girl.
But,
uh--
Time's
up,
I'm
afraid.
-
Um,
nearly,
nearly.
-
Sure.

do
you
do?
Oh,

did,
Fifteen
million
dollars.

In
fact,
I
think
it's
something
I'm
gonna
give
the
last
brownie
to
the
saddest
act
here.
-
Uh-oh.
Yeah,
all
right.
I
mean,
I
work
in
the
city
in
a
job
and
everyone
keeps
I
haven't
had
a
girlfriend
since--
And...
nobody
fancies
me.
And
if
these
cheeks
get
any
chubbier,
-
Nonsense.
I
fancy
you.
Yeah.
Or
I
did

You
see.
your
job
still
pays
you
whilst
Honey
here
flogging
her
guts
out
Yes!
And
I
haven't
got
hair.
And
I've
got
funny
goggly
eyes.
And,
actually,
because,
um,
my
boosies

You
see,
it's
incredibly
sad.
her
best
friend
is
Anna
Scott.
That's
true.
I
can't
deny
it.
And
most
of
her
limbs
work,
whereas
in
a
house
full
of
ramps.
And
to
add
insult
I've
totally
given
up
smoking,
And,
um,
well,
the
truth
is,
we
can't
have
a
baby.
Oh,
Belle.
C'est
la
vie.
Still,
um,
we're
lucky
in
lots
of
ways.
But
surely
that's
worth
a
brownie.
Well,
I
don't
know.
-
Very
unsuccessful
professionally.
Divorced.
Used
to
be
handsome,
And
absolutely
certain

she's
heard
that
his

did.
Thanks
very
much.
Thank
you.

Well,
wait.
I'm
sorry?

You'll
have
to
prove
it.
I'm
gonna
fight
for
it.
I've
been
on
a
diet
which
basically
means

I've
had
a
series
of
not-nice
Uh,
and
every
time
the
newspapers
splash
it
about
And...
it's
taken
two
rather
painful,
to
get
me
looking
like
this.
-
Really?
And
one
day
not
long
from
now,
they
will
discover
I
can't
act,
and
I
will
become
who...
looks
a
bit
like
someone
No,
nice
try,
gorgeous,

Pathetic
effort
-
Thank
you
for
such
a
terrific
time.
-
That's
a
great
tie.
Okay,
it's
true.
-
it
was
lovely
to
meet
you.
I'll
wait
until
you've
gone
-
No!
-
Good
night.
I
meant
to
leave.
Ring
me
if
you
want
someone
I
know
lots
of
nice,
cheap
places,
it
was
just
so
nice
to
meet
you.
-
Happy
birthday.
You're
my
style
guru.
-
Sorry.
Can
I
just--
-
Thanks.
-
Good
night,
everyone.

Max,
Belle,
-
Thank
you,
everybody.
Call
us.
-
Bye,
Anna.



Sorry.
They
always
do
that
It's
a
stupid
thing.
-
"Floppy",
huh?
-
Mm-hmm.
Why
is
she
in
a
wheelchair?
Uh,
because
she
had
an
accident
And
the
pregnancy
thing,
You
know,
I'm
not
sure.
I
don't
think
they
tried
for
kids
Do
you
want
to,
um--
My
place
is
just,
um--
Too
complicated.
That's
fine.

Busy
tomorrow?

I
thought
you
were
leaving
tomorrow.

these
streets
round
here

no,

the
point.

live
round

Oh.
You
abide
by
rules

that?
I
don't.
No,
no.
I
just
do
what
I
want.
Um--
Right.
-
Whoopsidaisies.
What
did
you
say?
-
Nothing.
-
No,
I
didn't.
No
one
says,
"Whoopsidaisies",
do
they?
There
is
no
"unless".

no
one

even
then

Right.

Oh!
Oh!

Yeah,
well,
it's
a
disease.
I'm
taking
pills
and
having
injections.
-
Okay,
stand
aside.
Really,
it's
quite,
um,
tricky.
Anna,
don't.
It's
harder
than
it--

on,

right.

Come
in.

were
taken
years
ago.
I
know
it
was--
But
I
was
poor
and--
That's
not
an
excuse.
But
to
make
matters
worse,
it
now
appears
as
though...
someone
was
filming
me
as
well.
So
what
was
a
stupid
now
looks
like
a
porn
film.
The
pictures
have
been
sold
everywhere.
I
didn't
know
where
to
go.

hotel's
surrounded.

What?
What
is
it?
-
Nothing,
really.
-
Anna,
no,
please!
My
God.
And
they
got
a
picture
of
you
Yes.
Undressed
like
this,
yeah.
-
Morning,
darling
ones.
No,
there
are
hundreds
of
them.
My
brilliant
plan
I
know.
I
know.
Damn
it.
-
Um,
I
wouldn't
go
outside.
-
Just
take
my
word
for
it.

How
did
I
look?
Not
at
all
bad.
Chicks
love
gray.
Nice
firm
buttocks.
How
are
you
doing?
How
do
you
think
I'm
doing?
-
I
don't
know
what
happened.
Your
furry
friend
thought
he'd
make

That's
not
true.
The
entire
British
press
She's
in
that
house

door
Then
you
go
out

I
went
out
in
my
goddamn
underwear
too.
Sorry.
-
I'm
so
sorry.
I
come
to
you
to
protect
myself
and
now
I've
landed
in
it
For
God's
sake,
I've
got
a
boyfriend!
-
You
have?
And
now,
tomorrow
there'll
be
I
know
that,
but...
You
stay
calm!
This
is
a
perfect
Minimum
input,
maximum
publicity.
Everywhere
you
go,
people
will
say,
You
slept
with
that
actress.

That
is
spectacularly
unfair.
Maybe
it'll
even
help
business.

Stop!
I
beg
you!
Calm
down.
I
don't

I

wanna
go

who
that
is,

Spike

I'm
asking
for
is
You're
right.
It's
just
that
I've
dealt

had
it

me?
It's

really
don't

This

anything
Newspapers

I'll
regret

Right.
Right.
I
will

that's

always

glad

Scott's
agent
and
her
agent
in
New
York.
Listen,
you
think
about
her
all
Yeah.
Brilliant.
Thanks.
I'll
see
you
tonight.

Shh!
Hello!
I
won't
stand
up
because
Exactly
a
year
ago
today,
this
man
here
-
Hear,
hear.
Unfortunately,
-
It's
a
tiny
hiccup.
And
so
we
have
to
face
the
fact
we
must
find
somewhere
new
to
eat.
I
just
want
to
say
to
Tony...
The
more
I
think
about
things,
the
more
No
one
knows
why
some
things
work
out
Why
some
of
us
get
lucky...

and
some
of
us--
-
What?
Yeah,
well,
it
seems
much
more
towards
And,
of
course,
well,
A
toast
to
Bernie--
the
worst
I
thank
you.
-
Tony
and
Bernie.
Both
crap...
in
their
own
special
ways.

Since
it's
an
evening
uh,
I've
also
got
one.
Um,
I've
decided
to
get
engaged.
I've
found
myself
a
nice,
who
I
know
is
gonna
make
me
happy
Wait
a
sec.
I
mean,
I--
I'm
your
brother.
I
don't
know
-
Is
he
financially
viable?
He's
an
artist...
-
This
is
a
secret

-
Me?
Well,
yeah.
Groovy.
Excuse
me.
Well,
actually,
yes.
I
feel
I
should
for
my
behavior
I
have,
as
you
know,
There's
an
understatement.
But
I
just
wish
to
make
it

No,

I
do.
Which
means
you
won't
be
distracted
grasping
her
Oscar...
and
currently
to
be
found
filming,
Oh,
God,
no.
So
not
over
her,
in
fact.

-
Can
I
help
you?
-
I'm
looking
for
Anna
Scott.
No.
No,
uh,
she
doesn't.
-
I'm
afraid
I
can't
let
you
through.
I
mean,
I
am
actually
a
friend.
-
No,
you
basically,
er--
Well,
this
is,
uh--
I
only
found
out
-
I
was
going
to
call,
but
I--
Yes.
Um--
Things
aren't
going
very
well,
Absolutely,
yeah.
But
if--
if
you
could
wait,
there
are...
things
to
say.
Okay.
Drink
tea.
Come
and
have
a
look.
Are
you
a
fan
of
Henry
James?
-
This
is
a
Henry
James
film?
This
is,
uh,
Harry.
He'll
give
you
a
pair
of
headphones
-
Thank
you
very
much.
-
Hi.
-
Volume's
on
the
side.
Have
a
seat.


We've
got
to.
Oh,
stop
showing
off.
-
I'm
not
listening.
So
many
tragic
young
teenagers
and
that
girl
has
an
ass
with
at
least
ten
other
women
I
would
think,
looking
at
you
and
your...
would
be
well
advised
to
keep
quiet.
Now
down
to
business.
Um,
I
ask
you
when
you're
Um,
tomorrow
will
be
soon
enough.
And
then
I--
Right.
Okay.
Say,
who
was
that
rather
diffident
chap
No
one.
Just
some
guy
from
the
past.
I--
it's
a
bit
of
an
awkward
situation.
'Course.
Thanks.
I've
got
to,
um--
Any
time.

Ladies
and
gentlemen,
On
your
first
marks!
Uh,
l-I
do
hate
to
disturb
you
but,
uh,
there's
a
delivery
for
you.
Martin,
really.
But
you
see,
this
is
not
for
the
shop.
Right.
Okay.
Tell
me,
if
I
employ
a
wet
rag,
would
l
Hi.
Hello.
You
disappeared.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um--
I
had
to
leave.
-
How
have
you
been?
When
they
change
the
law,
Whereas
you,
I've
watched
in
wonder.
-
Awards,
glory.
It's--
it's
all
nonsense,
believe
me.
I'd
no
idea
how
much
nonsense
nonsense
it
all
is.
Well,
um--
Yesterday
was
our
last
day
of
filming,
But,
um--
I
brought
this
for
you
from
home,
so
I
thought
I'd
give
it
to
you.
Thank
you.
Shall
I--
Oh,
no,
don't
open
it
now.
Well,
thank
you.
I
don't
know
Actually,
I
had
it
in
my
apartment,
But
when
it
came
to
it,
having
behaved
so
badly.
Twice.
So
it's
just
been
Then
you
came
and...
I
figured--
The
thing
is--
The
thing
is--
What?
What
is
the
thing?
Don't
even
think
about
it.
-
Go
away.
Sorry.
You
were
saying?
Yes.
I
have
to
go
away
today,
but
l...
wondered
if
I
didn't...
whether
you
might
or...
a
lot,
maybe.
See
if
you
could
like
me
again.
But
yesterday
and
you
just
I
heard.
You
had
a
microphone.
You
expect
me
to
the
most
indiscreet
man
Uh,
excuse
me.
It's
your
mother
on
the
phone.
Will
you
tell
her
I've
actually
tried
that
tack,
but
and
it's
now
been
about
24
hours...
and
the
foot
that
was
purple
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Martin,
hold
the
fort
a
second.
Uh,
yes.
All
right.
Um,
could
I
just
say--

I
thought
Ghost
-
Is
that
right?

Um,
I've
always
wondered...
what
Patrick
Swayze's
like
I
can't
say
that
I
know
Patrick
He
wasn't
that
friendly
during
filming?
Well,
I'm
sure
he
was
friendly
to
Oh.
Oh,
right.
Sorry.
Always
been
a
bit
of
an
ass.
Um,
anyway--
Um--
Well,
it
was
lovely
to
meet
you.
I'm
a
huge,
huge
fan
of
yours.
And
Demi's,
of
course.
Sorry.
That's
fine.
There's
always
a
pause
when
the
jury
Anna,
look,
um--
I'm
a
fairly
levelheaded
bloke,
not
often
in
and
out
of
love.
But,
uh--
Can
I
just
say
no
to
your...
kind
request
and,
uh,
leave
it
at
that?
Yes.
Fine.
Of
course.
I--
Of
course.
I'll
just
be
going,
then.
The
thing
is,
with
you
I'm
in
real...
danger.
It
seems
like
a...
perfect
situation,
apart
from
that
my
relatively
inexperienced
heart
recover,
uh,
if
I
was...
once
again
cast
aside,
There
are
just
too
many
pictures
of
you,
You'd
go
and
I'd
be,
uh,
well,
buggered,
basically.
That
really
is
a
real
no,
isn't
it?
I
live
in
Notting
Hill.
Everyone
in
the
world
My
mother
has
trouble
Fine.
Fine.
Good
decision.
The
fame
thing
isn't
really
real,
And
don't
forget
I'm--
I'm
also
just
a
girl...
standing
in
front
of
a
boy...
asking
him
to
love
her.
Good-bye.
So
what
do
you
think?

I
mean,
when
all's
said
and
done,
I
saw
her
taking
her
trousers
down,
and
I
definitely
glimpsed
Good
decision,
yeah.

Absolutely
not.

Yeah.

would

She
may
be
the
love
%
May
come
to
me
%
That
I
remember
till
the
day
I
die
%
%
She
may
be
the
reason
I
survive
%
%
The
why
and
wherefore
I'm
alive
%
%
The
one
I'll
care
for
%
And
ready
years
%
%
Me,
I'll
take
her
laughter
%
And
make
them
all
my
souvenirs
%
%
For
where
she
goes
I've
got
to
be
%
%
The
meaning
of
my
life
is
%
%
She
%

She
%

Oh,

I
could
be

I
gotta
say

me

hold
me

show
me

Made

the
way
we
make
love

you

I
love
you
