don't
you
Leave!
No,
no,
just
wait
a
minute.
We're
not
Come
on.
This
is
just
a
fight
and
tomorrow
it
will
be
-
Going?
Well,
she
must
have
She
was.
He
was
only
trying
Yeah.
But
what
he
really
should
have
done
is
just
told
those
parents
Just
stick
it
Yeah,
you're
right,
The
next
day,
to
find
her
world
What's
going
on?
We're
going
home.
-
We're
going
now?
No,
we're
not
supposed
to
be
leaving
Get
dressed
and
then
come
and
have
Willow
will
pack
Why,
I'd
be
happy
to
pack
your
things,
I
don't
want
I
don't
want
you
to
touch
my
stuff.
-
Yes,
you
are.
-
Yes,
Allie,
you
are.
Allie,
you
are
going
whether
Now,
even
if
Aaron
and
drag
you
the
whole
way,
Excuse
me.
-
All
right,
let's
go.
We
have
to
have
all
these
Come
on,
get
on!
You
shouldn't
be
standing
around.
Let's
go.
Fin!
Where's
Noah?
He's
out
-
What's
going
on?
-
Leaving?
-
When?
Look,
I
need
you
to
tell
Noah
I
need
you
And
tell
him
Look,
I
was
up
all
night
I've
never
seen
him
It's
over.
Don't
make
it
any
harder
No!
No,
it's
not
over.
Fin,
we
had
a
fight
No,
we
said
some
things
we
didn't
mean,
-
It
is
over.
Leave
it
alone.
I'm
coming.
Mama,
I'm
coming!
-
Look,
he
understands.
It's
hard,
Summer's
over
If
he
wants
to
talk
to
you,
Okay.
Okay,
can
you
just...
can
you
just
-
Can
you
do
that?
Thank
you.
Bye,
Fin.
She's
gone.
Summer
romances
end
But
when
all
they
have
They
are
shooting
stars...
a
spectacular
moment
a
fleeting
glimpse
And
in
a
flash,
Noah
was
desperate.
He
wrote
to
Allie
for
breaking
up
He
wrote
to
tell
her
that
he
still
loved
And
that
if
she
would
write
back,
He
wrote
one
letter
365
letters,
but
they
all
Hey
Fred!
Sorry.
All
right,
Finally,
after
a
year
he
decided
to
put
it
all
behind
him
So
he
wrote
And
he
and
Fin
and
headed
for
Atlanta.
Noah!
Noah!
Noah!
Come
on,
A
state
of
war
has
existed
between
The
Constitution
against
all
enemies,
Noah
and
Fin
And
after
two
years
through
they
were
deployed
Go!
Fin!
Do
I
contradict
myself?
Very
well
then,
Allie
was
in
her
when
she
volunteered
To
her,
the
broken
men
who
filled
the
ward
Or
someone
who
fought
or
frozen
I'm
gonna
lift
you
up.
Ready?
There
we
go.
Now,
I'm
gonna
bring
-
Set
it
on
the
stool.
-
You
okay?
Miss,
can
I
Hmm?
I
noticed
that
you
And
I
was
wondering
-
Excuse
me?
Now,
before
you
go
I'll
have
you
know
that
and
my
intentions
Okay,
okay
Let's
just
then
we'll
talk
Would
you
get
Oh
my
gosh,
-
What
is
he
doing
here?
He's
staring
at
you.
Oh,
miss?
I'm
all
better.
Now,
how's
Allie
was
surprised
she
fell
in
love
He
was
handsome,
smart,
funny,
sophisticated
Hey!
He
also
came
from
and
was
What?
Hya!
Oh,
what's
happening?
-
Where
you
going?
-
See
you
later,
sweetheart.
Allie,
I've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
Okay,
I
give
up,
Well
see,
that's
the
thing,
An
then,
it
just
dawned
on
me.
-
My
parents?
-
Your
old
mom
and
dad.
Mom?
You
see,
the
problem
is
-
I'm
exactly
the
type
of
man
-
They
want
you
to
end
up
with.
You
know,
I'm
wealthy,
You
know,
I'm
an
incredible
dancer,
You
look
great.
-
I
like
to
think...
-
Now
just
this,
if
you
marry
me...
-
Now
listen
close.
-
If
you
marry
me...
Then
you
will
have
lost
a
life
long
Oh
my
goodness,
-
I
do
not
know.
Hey,
band,
Hey,
band,
Ooh
bop
sha
bam,
-
Oh
bop
sha
bam,
shi
bimmy
bop
-
Ally
ally
ally
ooh
-
Olly
olly
olly
ooh
-
Whooly
ooh
-
Whooly
ooh
See
Allie,
I
think...
-
I
think
you
need
to
marry
me.
-
Yes
you
do.
Because
if
you
do,
the
unhappiness
that
you
feel
for
I
think
you
may
And
what's
that?
Well,
you
see
you
have
to
And
I
think
you
may
have
overestimated
Is
that
right?
-
Mm-hmm.
Then
why
not?
Oh,
'cause
I
asked
them
What?
One
more
thing.
I
love
you.
Will
you
marry
me,
honey?
I
know
I
kid
around
a
lot,
Marry
me?
Make
me
Yes.
Yes!
-
Just
hold
tight.
Oh
my
God.
Mama.
Okay,
stop
the
band.
Excuse
me.
I'd
like
that
this
young
lady
She
agreed
with
all
her
heart,
why
at
the
very
moment
Noah's
face
Hey,
Noah,
yeah!
Oh,
good
to
see
you.
You
bleeding
anywhere?
-
Everything
good?
Oh,
I
love
you.
Come
on,
there's
something
-
Come
on.
What's
going
on?
What
is
this?
Here.
I
sold
the
house.
-
You
sold
the
house?
Gotta
be
out
Between
that
and
your
GI
Bill,
-
Get
what?
-
The
Windsor
Plantation.
Now,
don't
Dad
me,
I
already
talked
to
the
bank,
-
Well,
I
can't
let
you
sell
your
house.
It's
a
good
thing.
Wait
a
second.
You
sell
the
house,
With
you,
dummy,
Somebody's
got
Noah
took
a
look
but
only
saw
Allie.
He
decided
right
there
He
would
rebuild
the
old
house
And
when
Noah
went
to
Charleston
fate
stepped
in
Stop
the
bus!
Sorry,
Mac,
I
can't
stop
the
bus
No,
no,
no,
please
stop
Do
you
understand
No
one
gets
off
till
we
get
-
God.
Watch
it,
screwball!
What
are
you
doing?
Hey!
How
old
is
your
daughter
now?
-
Well,
you
mind.
Baby,
hello.
-
Oh!
Oh,
come
with
it.
After
seeing
Allie
that
day,
something
inside
He
got
the
notion
that
if
he
restored
where
they
had
Allie
would
find
a
way
Some
called
it
Others
called
it
But
in
fact,
-
Excuse
me.
It's
time
to
eat.
Lunch
will
be
served
The
melon
is
good.
Did
they
ever
Noah
and
Allie?
Now
you
don't
want
before
I
get
Where
did
I
leave
off?
I
shall
not
want.
When
Noah's
father
the
house
He
leadeth
me
down...
In
time,
Noah
Okay,
smile.
He
took
a
good
look
got
rip-roaring
drunk
thought
seriously
then
finally
I'm
prepared
He
had
a
number
but
he
always
found
a
reason
No.
Either
the
bids
or
if
they
met
he
felt
it
was
worth
It's
a
lot
of
money,
$50,000.
-
That's
more
than
my
asking
price.
It's
a
great
deal
more.
He
told
the
man
that
offered
him
that
no
one
in
his
right
mind
and
he
wouldn't
have
He
worked
out
his
frustration
with
life
And
in
the
evenings,
there
was
Martha
Shaw.
Martha
was
a
war
widow
who
lived
in
Quail
Ridge,
So
you
want
to
go
out
I
got
to
work.
Well,
we
could
Next
week,
sometime.
Maybe
we
could
No.
Well,
What
do
you
want,
Noah?
What
do
you
mean,
From
me.
Sometimes
when
you
talk
to
me,
Look,
a
woman
knows
and
sees
someone
else.
Now
you
know
I
want
to
give
you
right?
But
I
can't,
because
they're
gone...
they're
broken.
All
right?
Is
the
veil
too
much?
Are
you
kidding?
You're
the
most
-
You
look
gorgeous,
honey.
Wait
until
Lon
sees
you
in
this
dress,
He
won't
be
able
or
his
hands.
Oh,
you're
bad!
Have
you
seen
The
"Daily
Journal"
says
-
the
social
highlight
of
the
season.
This
is
gonna
be
a
celebration
the
likes
She
doesn't
plan,
-
Mama,
look,
the
Governor's
coming.
Oh,
boy.

All
right
Savannah,

are
we
at?

Memphis,
where
are
at?
89,

Sir?
You
have
a
visitor.
Well,
hello.
I'm...
I'm
so
sorry,
Baby,
what
are
you
talking
about?
-
Guys,
could
you
give
us
a
minute?
Yes,
sir.
Ma'am.
So
what's
up?
I
don't
paint
anymore.
I
used
to
paint
I
really
loved
it.
-
I
didn't
know
that.
So
paint.
I
will.
-
I'm
gonna
start.
Is
everything
okay?
I
need
to
get
away.
Okay.
I
need
to
take
care
I
need
to
clear
Okay,
-
No,
I
don't
think
so.
Listen,
are
you
-
Yeah.
Take
your
time,
It's
okay
to
be
nervous,
It's
normal
to
get
No,
no
second
I
love
you.
I'm
going
to
be
back
from
Seabrook
-
Seabrook?
Hello.
I
saw
your
picture
the
one
with
you
And
I
just
wanted
to
come
I
mean,
I
wasn't
I
just...
So
are
you
okay?
Okay,
good.
I'm
a
stupid
woman,
You
want
to
come
in?
Okay.
This
is
a
good
story.
I'm
glad
you
like
it.
I
think
Yes.
Perhaps
more
than
once?
Doctor
needs
-
Me?
Now?
But
he
hasn't
finished
I'll
read
some
more
This
shouldn't
take
-
All
right.
I'll
be
right
back.
While
you
waiting,
maybe
you'd
like
You
do
like
that.
-
I
do?
-
I
don't
know
any
tunes.
-
No
kidding?
Who
are
you?
I'm
Dr.
Barnwell,
We
haven't
met,
Okay,
so
I
see
here
that
you've
had
two
heart
attacks
Yeah,
minor
ones,
-
Okay,
any
complications?
Okay,
deep
breath
Okay,
one
more
time.
And
deep
breath.
And
one
more.
Terrific,
terrific.
-
Every
day,
twice
a
day.
Okay,
you
can
So
I
understand
that
you
Yeah,
to
help
-
Hmm.
No,
I
don't.
She
remembers,
Doc.
I
read
to
her
Not
always,
But
senile
dementia
It's
degenerative.
After
a
certain
point,
Yeah,
that's
what
Well,
I
just
don't
want
Well,
thanks,
Doc,
Science
goes
only
so
far
Then
comes
God.
Damn,
I
forgot
to
turn
the
page
for
her.
I
guess
they
flipped
No,
that
she's
playing
His
name
Hammond?
As
in
Hammond
Cotton.
Well,
your
parents
He's
a
really
good
man,
Noah.
You
love
him?
Yeah,
I
do.
Well,
that's
that.
You
marry
Lon
right?
Right.
Are
you
hungry?
Do
you
want
to
stay
Umm...
I
have
to
warn
you,
A
couple
more
of
these
and
you're
gonna
Well,
you
go
slow
then,
I
don't
want
You
wouldn't
dare.
Not
yet.
What?
Why
are
you
Just
memories.
This
room.
This...
This
is
the
room?
Huh...
-
I'm
full.
"Oh
how
your
fingers
Your
breath
falls
Your
pulse
lulls
I
feel
a
merge
Delicious
enough."
It
was
real,
wasn't
it?
You
and
me.
Such
a
long
time
ago,
But
we
really
loved
I
should
go.
Goodbye.
Do
you
think
There's
some
place
Please.
-
Okay.
She
had
come
back
into
his
life
like
a
sudden
flame,
blazing
and
streaming
Noah
stayed
up
contemplating
the
certain
agony
if
he
were
Oh,
I
do
wish
I
could
The
children
are
here.
Children?
-
Not
yours,
his.
Do
you
mind?
Why,
I'd
love
Come
over
here.

some
more

Goodbye.

Nice
to
meet
you.
Bye.

She
seems
good
today.
I
don't
know,
there's
Maybe
it's
a
day
Daddy,
come
home.
Mama
doesn't
know
us.
She
doesn't
recognize
you.
We
miss
you.
This
is
crazy,
Yeah,
you
know
we'll
all
help
with
Mom.
Look,

my
sweetheart
I'm
not
leaving
her.
This
is
my
home

Your
mother
is
my
home.

Hello?
Hi,

is
this?
It's
Lon,
Uh,
nobody,
I...
I
just...
I'm
just
surprised.
Well,
there's
only
one
And
when
you
didn't
call,
Where
you
been?
You
know,
I
feel
like
an
idiot,
'cause
I
I'm
fine.
Anything
you
want
-
No.
No.
Okay.
Lon,
I
love
you.
Call
you
tomorrow?
Okay.
Noah?
Noah!
Hey,
there.
Well,
we
better
get
going,

You
like
it?
It's
like
a
dream.
-
Do
you
want
to
feed
them?
What
are
they
all
I
don't
know.
They're
supposed
to
migrate
They
won't
stay
here?
No...
they'll
go
back
You're
different.
What
do
you
mean?
Just
the
way
you
look.
You
look
different
too,
You
know,
you're
kinda
Yeah?
Yeah.
And
you
really
did
it.
-
What?
The
house...
it's
beautiful
Well,
I
promised
you
Great.
We
got
to
go.
Noah!
Why
didn't
you
Why?
It
wasn't
over
for
me.
I
waited
for
you
And
now
it's
too
late.
I
wrote
you
365
letters.
I
wrote
you
every
day
-
You
wrote
me?
You...
It
wasn't
over.
It
still
isn't
over.
Oh...
You
got
All
this
time,
Let's
do
it
again.
Noah.
Noah.
Wake
up.
-
Wake
up.
-
Um-mmm.

Mm-hmm.
-
Hi.

Huh-uh.

Mmm...
I
need
rest.
I
need
food
Okay,
what
do
you
want?
Umm...
umm...
some
pancakes.
Okay.
And
bacon.
-
Okay.
She's
the
one,
Can
I
meet
her?
I'd
really
like
to
meet
her.
I
don't
know
if
that's
So
this
is
Martha?
Hi,
I'm
Allie.
I've
heard
I've
heard
You
want
to
come
in?
Are
you
sure?
Yeah,
yeah,
And,
you
know,
Come
on
in.
Come
on
in.
It
was
nice
meeting
you,
-
Nice
meeting
you
too.
Take
care.
She's
sensational.
I'm
really
glad
I'd
forgotten
For
the
first
time
I
feel
like
I've
got
something
Mmm...
Lon
is
on
his
way
here.
I'm
afraid
your
father
spilled
and
when
Lon
didn't
hear
he
decided
to
come.
Well,
that's
great.
You,
me,
Noah
and
Lon,
Tell
me
about
-
Is
it
true?
You
watched
me
for
months
and
months
and
you
never
-
How
could
you
do
that?
-
You're
sorry?
You're
sorry?
Because
of
you,
Okay,
yes,
It
was
wrong,
and
at
least
take
some
You
came
down
here.
You
knew
this
would
happen.
Oh,
so
now
I'm
a
tramp?
You
are
unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Go
on
and
get
Let's
take
a
drive.
Let's
take
a
drive?
Why
would
I
want
Because
I
might
know
you
And
I
don't
want
thinking
that
you
might
have
What
are
we
Do
you
see
Mm-hmm.
Don't
look
like
it
now,
oh
my
goodness,
We
were
out
of
our
minds
Wow.
Well,
naturally,
we
decided
We
didn't
even
make
the
next
town
But
that
was
then.
You
know
sometimes
I
just
stop
here
trying
to
picture
how
different
my
life
I
want
you
to
know
-
Mama,
I'm...
and
you
need
He
is
a
wonderful
