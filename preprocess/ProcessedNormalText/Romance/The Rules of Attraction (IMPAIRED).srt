Han-kyung!
This...
Didn't

this
by
mistake?
Forgive
me,
Han-kyung!
Sorry!
Tae-sung
asked
me
to
break
you
two
up
l
never
thought
it'd
get
so
big...
Don't
lie!
Tae-sung
wouldn't
Who
are
you?
Tae-sung,
he's
your
brother,
right?
Tae-sung
and
l
are
old
friends
Boy,
he
could
sure
act
yesterday
Why
the
hell
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
Why?
You'd
have
to
ask
him
To
love
your
own
sister
What
kind
of
cruel
joke
is
that?
Don't
you
feel
sorry
for
him?
lt's
all
lies,
isn't
it?
Han-kyung!
What
are
you
doing?
l
said,
what
are
you
doing!
-
Hae-won,
look
at
this
-
Bo-jung
Lee!
her
fall
and
hit
her
head!
Yo-won,
take
her
to
the
infirmary
Tae-sung,
that
bastard
She's
acting
right
now!
Believe
you?
Believe
you
after
you
left
yesterday
like
that?
Bo-jung's
tricking
you
right
now!
Whatever
kind
of
girl
she
is
whatever
her
game
is
with
me
l
don't
care
about
people
What
makes
me
mad
is
you!
Han-kyung,
you!
Are
you
still
suspicious
You
still
don't
know
Me?!
To
be
honest,
it's
hard
for
me
to
watch
you
two
ls
that
how
little
you
trust
me?
You
really
can't
trust
me?
Go
be
with
the
person
you
really
like!
lt'd
be
easier
for
both
you
and
me
Alright
l'm
also
really
tired
of
you
thinking
of
Tae-sung
and
me
that
way
Go
to
Bo-jung
who
likes
you...
Bo-jung
Lee!
You
dare
make
my
sister
cry!
Are
you
really
okay?
Should
we
go
to
the
hospital?
Tae-sung...
You
really
don't
know
a
Bo-jung
Lee?
don't
know?
No...
Why?
Tae-sung,
it's
Bo-jung!
Who
are
you?
Tae-sung,
it's
me,
Bo-jung
Han-kyung
and
Hae-won
finally
broke
up
l
did
good
so
buy
me
a
dinner
What
the
hell
are
you
talking
about?
Hey,
hey
[l
got
beat
up
cause
of
you
You
Are
you
really
the
Tae-sung
l
know?
How
can
you
do
this
to
me?
What's
this
about
you
and
Hae-won
Even
if
you
liked
me
This
is
wrong
l
don't
know
what's
going
on!
l'm
going
now
Nuna!
Nuna!
Nuna!
You
think
l
broke
you
two
up?
l
trusted
you
l

lt
wasn't
me!
You're
wrong!
Let's
talk
later
Guess
you
are
young
Hey!
Where's
this
Hae-won
jerk?
-
Go
ask
someone
else
These
youngsters,
they
never
learn
Man,
you
got
a
temper...
Cheer
up
Wanna
hear
some
good
news?
Tae-sung,
he
got
totally
beat
up
Those
thugs
beat
him
like
a
wet
dog
Hey
Yo,
Hae-won,
welcome!
We
were
waiting
for
you
Chicken
shit...
Watcha
doing
beating
on
a
kid?
Hey
How'd
you
get
here?
Heard
you
got
the
crap
You
guys
here
to
fight?
That
bastard's
mine
Tae-sung!
You
okay,
Tae-sung?
Tae-sung,
you
alright?
You
okay?
Bo-jung
Lee...
That's
cool
Well...
Maybe
l
won't?
Please
don't!
Exactly
what
l
was
hoping
Hae-won,
l
have
a
favor
to
ask
What?
While
l'm
gone...
Take
good
care
of
my
sister
You
don't
need
to
ask,
idiot...
Go
running
to
her
when
she
calls,
buy
her
lots
of
food
and
call
her
nuna!
Well,
that
might
be
a
problem
And
also...
Man,
we'll
see
each
other
again
And
also
what?
And...
Han-kyung
Jung!
Ooh,
that
must
hurt
l
told
you
to
stay
away
from
Hae-won
She
can't
trust
her
boyfriend
How
can
a
guy
love
his
sister?
Right?
That's
really
whacked...
-
l
can't
forgive
you,
l
can't
-
Ooh!
Bo-jung's
really
mad
-
See
this?
Damnit
You
bitch!
You
wanna
die,
huh!
l
just
did
what
Jae-hee
told
me
to!
Ha!
You
said
it'd
be
fun!
Just
kill
him
Hey,
you
told
me
to
You
all
same
kinds
Hae-won,
leave
them
to
me
You
two
are
dead!
Tae-sung
asked
me
not
to
tell
you
but
you'd
probably
hate
me
forever
You
can't
go
like
this,
Tae-sung
Nuna
l
didn't
think
l
could
Nuna...
ln
our
next
life
don't
be
my
sister
You
can
be
really,
really
ugly
just
please
don't
be
my
sister
Tae-sung
Come
