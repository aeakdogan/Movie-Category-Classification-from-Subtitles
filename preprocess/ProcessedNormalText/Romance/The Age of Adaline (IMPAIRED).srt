I'm
sorry,
we

But

Just
weeks
later
when,
Adaline

it's
pretty
lavish.
Well,
I
better
get
to
it
then.
I'll
see
you
soon.

Hmm.

Are
you

No?

No?

So,

Someplace
with
better
food.
Yourself?
Back
to
the

I
just
wanted
to
spend

Well,
that
was
a
risky
move.
Leaving
your
date
upstairs.

What
are
you
talking
about?
Does
her
name
happen
to
end
in
"kova"?

No.
Her

Her

Taxi,
ma'am?
-
Good
night.
I'll
just
wait
with
you.
So
you
can
find
out
where
I
live?

It
does
make
it
a
lot
easier
to
send
flowers.

Goodbye.
It's
been
an
adventure
meeting
you.
Thank
you.

Wait!
There

How

So,
when
are
you
moving
back
up?

Right
on
schedule.
I
see
you
already
No.
I
am
simply
choosing
to
ignore
it.
Actually,
um...
I'm
thinking
of
moving
myself.
But
you
love

you

I
do.
Last

We

together
But
you're
not
What
if
you
moved
What
if
you
got
sick?
Then
I
would
hope
What
if
I'm
too
late?
No.
No.
We
cannot
do
this.
It's
a
holiday.
CORA:
I

What

clucking
about?
Mr.

books?
Do
you
know?
Because
his

Hi.
I'm

Oh,

Welcome,

On

I'd

to
express
our
sincere
gratitude
I
left
them

If
you
don't
mind,
we'd
like
a

Yeah.
Sure.
Can
you
give
me
one
second,
though?
Hey.
It's

Great.
I'll

No

I
would
like
for
you
Oh,
no.
I
can't
do
that.
Yes,
you
can.
No.
I
don't
want
my
photo
taken.
Don't
worry.
You
look
stunning.
It's
not
about
vanity.
Suit
yourself.
-
You
wouldn't
do
that.
I
just...
Okay,
fine,
fine.
Let
me
take
you
out
tomorrow.
Okay.
That's
impossible.
All
right.
Well,
I'll
just
pack
up
the
books

Where?
Someplace
you've
never
been.
Well,
if
it's
in
this
city,
Try
me.
MAN:
You
can
leave
your
boots
at
the
front

And
I'll
be
right
outside.
All
right.
All
right.
I
give

Isn't

something?
Oh...
Is

Yeah,

I
developed

my

figured
out
that
it
could
So
we
started
a
company
sold
it
three
years
later,
and
with
my
half,
um,
Your
job
Yeah,
that's
right.
But
if
you
want
to
make
it's
a
lot
harder
than
it
seems.
What
about
you,
Jenny?
Oh.
Um...
I
own
a
dog.
Okay.
I
should
be
getting
back.
But
we're
having
lunch.
Um,
it's
too
late,
Ellis.
Okay.
Let
me
at
least
walk
you
back.
ADALINE:
Thank
you
for
all
of
this.
Huh.
Okay.
I
have
an
idea.
I'll
tell
you
a
joke
you
have
to
go
out
with
me
one
more
time
I
mean,
if
you
don't
laugh,
I'll
know
we're
That
must
be
It's
the
funniest
But
it's
subtle,
so
you
probably
-
Yeah,
probably
not.
Do
you
like
baseball?
-
Yeah,
I...
I
love
it.
So,
one
day
at
Fenway
Park,
Do
you
know
who
he
was?
Oh,
come
on.
"The
Thumper."
What?
Yeah.
Anyway,
so,
and
this
horse
walks
up
"I
want
to
play
-
An
actual
horse?
Hmm.
So,
Ted's
like,
And
the
horse
says,
"I
can
hitjust
like
you
So
he
picks
up
And
he
throws
him

Into
the
bleachers.
So,
Ted's,
like,
And
the
horse
says,
So
Ted
hits
him
He's
a
vacuum
cleaner.
Yeah.
So,
Ted's,
like,
"Woah!
Can
you
pitch?"
And
the
horse
just
looks
at
him
"Who
ever
heard
of
a
horse
pitching?"
-
Yeah!
Yes!

On,
no.

-
The
lady
has
been
conquered.
That's
the
worst

years.
They're
developing
something
It
could
revolutionize
But
you
won't
see
It
could
be
a
few
years
away.
That's
all
right.
I'd
hate
to
see

I'm

Well,

you're
going

be
I
want
you
to
eat
every
last
bite.
Oh.
There

Yeah.


Hello?

Okay.
Um,

Unfinished?

No.

I'm
truly
overjoyed.

have
no
idea.
ADALINE:
I
like
your
view.
-
Mm.
ELLIS:
Thank
you.
I
like
the
way
you
read.
What?
The
first
time
I
saw
you,
you
were
reading.
Your
hair
was
pulled
back
It
was
a
book
in
braille.
ADALINE:
How
long
Long
enough
to
realize
And
that
I
had
to
meet
you.
I
didn't
know
I
knew
I
would.
I
think
I,
um...
I
think
I
remember
that
day.
Um...
Yes,
um,
it
was
a
book
and
because
of
all
it
made
it
nearly
-
You're
kidding.
You're
kidding.

It
was
braille
for
beginners
You
can
tell
me
anything
you
want
I
know
almost
It's
better
this
way.
No,
it's
not.
Tell
me
something
Let
go.

Hi.
Good
morning.
Okay,
move
your
arms.
Oh,
okay,
I
get
it.
Will
you
ever
come
back?
Are
you
sure
there's
no
one
there
who
No,
no.
We
want
it
all.

-

I
have
to
go.
Uno
momenta,
por
favor.
Just
give
me
a
second,
okay?
I
can't.
What
are
you
trying
to
say?
The
Rainforest
Trust
Hmm,
well,
Thank
you.

I'm
late
for
work.
Wait.
That's
it?
Let
go.
CAB
DRIVER:
Ma'am?
I
changed
my
mind.
You
got
it.

Reese.
Reese?


Baby.
Are
you
okay?
Are
you
okay,
baby?
VETERINARIAN:
VETERINARIAN:
Which
means
his
kidneys
are
failing.
The
toxins
are
building
up
in
his
body.
Is
he
in
pain?
It's
difficult
to
say.
If
you
were
me,
I'd
be
thinking
about
what
a
wonderful
life

And
how
lucky
you
are

Um...

Of
course.





Hey,
Jenny,
this
is
Ellis.
I
hope
you
got
my
messages.





ELLIS:
Jenny.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
tried
to
call,
but...
How
did
you
get
my
address?
Um...
The
library.
Come
on,
don't
be
upset.
My
dog,
I
had
to,
um...
-
I
had
to
put
him
down.
You
should
have
waited
Um,
Jenny,
I'm...
There's
a
reason
I'm
sorry,
honestly.
This
isn't
going
to
work.
Are
you
serious?
Hi.
For
you.
FLEMMING:
Barbara
Ireland,
she
got
rid
of
all
I
could
no
sooner
Well,
it
looks
like
You
have
had
such
FLEMMING:
Yeah,
I
just
wish
you
had...
You
know,
that
you
could
have
So
do
I.
Remember
that?
1954.
I
was
a
junior
That's
the
last
photo
Well,
if
you've
seen
one,

It's
true.
What
is
it?
What's
wrong?
I'm
just
tired
of
running,
of
lying
to
good
people.
Then
stop.
Nobody's
chasing
you
anymore.
Anyone
who
was
ever
suspicious
You
don't
have
Don't
you
miss
It's
been
such
a
long
time.
Well,
it's
not
the
same
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
mean
a
future
together,

Without
that,
love
is...
It's
just
heartbreak.
It's
the
same
How
many
times
has
Too
many.
If
I
had
your
looks
and
your
energy,
-

I
did
meet
someone.
What?
On
New
Year's
Eve.
-
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?

Don't
get
too
excited.
I
told
him
to
leave
me
alone.
I
was
horrible.
Cruel.
Tell
him
you're
sorry.
I
can't.
I'm
leaving.
You're
moving
to
Oregon,
Come
on.
If
you
won't
do
it
for
yourself,
do
it
for
me.
If
you
won't
do
it
for
yourself,
do
it
for
me.
Please?
-
Hello.
Um,
I'm
here
to
see
Ellis
Jones.
Oh.
Let's
see
what
And
you
are?
Incredibly
sorry.
Incredi...
Eh,
Mr.
Jones,
I
bet
you
got
a
name.
Jennifer
Larson.
Please
tell
him
I'm
just
here
to
say
I'm
sorry.
And
that
my
life
since
longer
than
he
can
imagine.
And
I
just...
I
was
emotional
the
other
day.
And...
Now
I
realize
and
I've
just
been
And
I
know
better
now.
And
that's
why
Okay.
And
ask
if
he
could
and
let
me
make
it
up
to
him
Please.
Uh,
there's
a
Jennifer
Larson.
Oh,
you
heard
that.
He
wants
to
know
Someplace
he's
never
-
Hello.
Come
on.
ELLIS:
All
right.
You
don't
actually
think
ADALINE:
Oh,
be
quiet.
This
used
to
be
one
-
A
movie
theater?
In
the
1930s,
read
about
a
chemical
magnate
in
Camden,
New
Jersey.
And
so,
naturally,
she
needed
one
of
her
Everyone
thought
She
would
sleep
with
anyone
And
she
used
to
put
on
these
airs
Which,
in
fact...
-
Anyway.
Because
of
local
ordinances,
so
she
brought
all
That's
the
screen
It
was
spectacular...
I
imagine.
-
Are
you
ready
for
the
best
part?
Okay.
Look
up.
ELLIS:
Oh!
ADALINE:
She
had
They
took
the
time
ADALINE:
Isn't
it
beautiful?
Yeah.
Haha.
What
are
you
doing?
Come
on.

Cheers.
ELLIS:
The
great
paradox
the
better
our
instruments
get,
but
not
into
the
future,
events
whose
light
ADALINE:
I
don't
think
I'll
ever
understand
The
future
has
We
could
talk
about
ours.
-
Ellis...
I'm
talking
What
did
you
have
in
mind?
My
parents
are
having
a
party
It's
just
a
couple
hours
Come
with
me.
Okay.
-
Can
I
drive?

Oh,
my
God.
You
know,
There's
a
reason
for
that.
You
might
want
to
consider
on
that
square
pedal
by
your
foot.
I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
Oh!
Woah,
woah,
Oh,
my
God!

Oh,
I'm
sorry.
What's
wrong
with
you?
Do
me
a
favor.
Oh,
I'd
rather
not
get
stabbed.

That's
my
sister.
-
ADALINE:
Oh!
-
Sorry.
-
What's
up,
pussycat?
-
What's
it
look
like?
-
How
are
you?
-
Oh!
ELLIS:
Yeah.
It's
good
to
see
you,
too.
-
Hello.
Kikki,
this
is
Jenny.
Jenny,
this
is
my
sister.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
You
should
have
told
me
We
would
have
picked
I
stopped
using
Any
particular
reason?
To
protest
the
involvement
in
the
development
Oh.
-
Kikki
graduated
from
Berkeley.
So,
this
is
the
new
one,
huh?

Have
you
done
him
yet?
Yes,
10
minutes
ago,

So,
what's
the
story
with
this
girl?
I've
told
you
Thank
you.
A
beautiful
girl
working
in
a
public
library.
Maybe
she
likes
books.
Or
maybe
she
Googled
him,
and
found
out
about
worked
her
way
in
there
Yeah,
I'll
bet
that's
it.
Shouldn't
they
be
here
You
clear
the
table.
KATHY:
They're
here!
Yeah,
yeah.
How
do
I
look?
Very
pretty.
-
Oh,
there
you
are!
Oh,
honey.
Look
who
we
picked
up
-
Hi.
-
So,
this
is
Jenny.
-
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you.
You
must
be
exhausted
-
Oh,
no,
it
was
nothing.
Now,
I'm
not
amused.
It
wasn't
me,
it
was
Jenny.
I
swear.
-
Let
me
take
your
coat.
WILLIAM:
Where
have
What,
did
you
forget
-
No.
Um,
this
is
my
dad,
William.
Dad,
this
is...
WILLIAM:
Adaline.
ADALINE:
Er,
Jenny,
actually.
Dad,
are
you
okay?

I'm
sorry.
It's
just...
You
look
exactly
like
Adaline
Bowman.
That's
my
mother.
You're
joking?
Really?
-
Yeah.
Did
you
know
her?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I
mean...
We
were
very
close.
I...
I
knew
her
in
London.
Yeah.
Yeah,
she
lived
there
in
the
'60s.
Right
before
she
moved
to
Paris,
-
Incredible.
What
are
the
odds?
Wow,
wow.
The
resemblance
is...
You
must
hear
that
For
as
long
Wow.
We
were
very
close.
You
said
that
already,
honey.
Oh,
yeah,
I
must
have.
No,
no.
I
remember
your
close,
close
friends.
How
is
she?
She
passed
away.
Six
years
ago.
No.
Really?
Oh,
wow.
I'm
so
sorry.
Um...
Extraordinary
woman.
Yeah,
well,

Eh,
um...
Come
on.
KATHY:
Yeah,
yeah,
Um...
We're
kind
of
tired,
actually.
I
think
we'll
head
up
-
Me,
too.
Mm-hmm.
All
right.
ELLIS:
Ah,
you're
in
the
back.
-
Hey.
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you.
-
Dad.
Hey,
baby.
WILLIAM:
Miss!
-
You
know,
if
you
keep
doing
that,
Thank
you.
Well,
you're
going
to
get
I'm
sorry.
I've
done
everything
It
just...
It
won't
work.
All
right,
all
it
needs
Just
lose
the
brake,
you
pop
your
clutch
Okay.
Thank
you.
-
Ready?
-
Okay!
Okay,
now
pop
your
clutch.
Ahhh!
Haha!
Thank
you!
You're
welcome.

NARRATOR:
They
would
spend
And
Adaline
did
something
You
know,
Adaline
Bowman.
-
But
my
friends
call
me
Della.
Thank
you.
NARRATOR:
Three
weeks
later,
William
flew
home
Adaline
came
with
him.

Hey.
How
did
you
sleep?
-
Fine.
I'm
sorry
about
last
night.
I
must
be
losing
it.
It's
okay.
-
Hey.
Not
too
late.
Hmm.
Hi,
baby.
KATHY:
Where's
Jenny?
ELLIS:
She'll
be
down
-
She
was
up
all
night
tossing
and
turning.
You
know,
Uh,
we
met
in
an
elevator
Some
coffee?
No,
thank
you.
ELLIS:
But
I'd
seen
her
Hey.
It
was
at
the
library.
I
knew
she
was
an
original.
Here
you
go,
baby.
How
did
you
meet
her
mother?
WILLIAM:
Uh,
it
was
outside
London.
WILLIAM:
Uh,
it
was
outside
London.
Her
car
broke
down.
So,
she
was
English.
Oh,
no,
no.
She
spoke,
like,
I...
I
think
so.
-
Wow.
-
Jenny's
brilliant
with
languages,
too.
So,
um,
how
old
were
you
Oh,
I
was
about...
Let's
see,
it
was
the
second
I
was
thinking
about
quitting
medicine.
But
I
was...
I
was
afraid
I
was
too
old
to
start
over.
I
told...
I
told
Adaline
about
it
She
said,
"Go
for
it.
"Life's
too
short."
If
it
wasn't
for
her,
I
probably
wouldn't
She
was
only
a
couple
years
older
than
I
was,
She
was
so
sophisticated.
Um...
She,
uh...

-
What?
Honey.
What?
What's
going
on?
What,
you
think
this
is
funny?
What
do
you
mean?
What
did
I
do?
"You
were
very
close."
You
said
that
to
me
twice
now.
And
you
should
see
your
face
Are
you
going
to
wax
nostalgic
Look.
It's
just
that
she
looks
that
I'm
remembering
things
Well,
I
hate
feeling
-
What
do
you
mean
second
choice?
-
Second
choice?
Forty
years,
baby.
Second
choice?
Uh-uh.
Honey,
you're
blowing
Am
I?
Are
you
jealous?
Huh?
Well,
yeah,
as
a
matter
of
fact.

Look.
Look.
It
was
fleeting.
Inconsequenfial.
It
sounded
like
you
I
love
you.
-
I
love
you,
too.

I'm
coming.
It's
not
the
most
Thanks
for
being
-
Of
course.
Sorry
about
my
dad.
He's
lovely.
Hey,
your
mom
must
have
Yeah,
she
was.
WILLIAM:

All
the

I
spent
I
was
hoping

Have
you
played
this
before?
Kikki,
come
on!
KIKKII
DO
I
have
110?
ALL:
Yes.
The
idea
is
to
get
enough
-
Of
pie.
They're
wedges.
You
get
enough
Okay?
KIKKI:
Most
of
the
questions
Hence
the
word
"trivial."
Yeah,
like,
Um,
"On
June
22nd,
1938,
this
American
boxer
"when
he
beat
Max
Schmeling

Well,
that
is
a
tough
one.
Um...
Sonny
Liston?
Joe
Louis.
Good
guess,
though.
Really.
Yeah.
Women
and
boxing.
It's
cute.
Okay.
Excuse
me.
What
did
you
say?
Okay,
you
know
what?
-
Here,
roll
the
dice.
Here
we
go.
The

so.

used
to
have

-
Okay,
let's
go.
-

come
on.
Jenny.
For
the
win.
"Of
what

was

Um,

Israel.

It's
okay.
We
still
love
you.
How
does
that
feel,
Dad?
I'm
all
right.
Let's
look
at
page
two,
okay?
Section
three,
paragraph
H.
-
I'm
sorry.
Sure.
ELLIS:
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Now
let's
look
at
page
10.
How
many
stars
I
don't
know,
500
million.

Couple
of
100
billion.
Plato
believed
that
every
soul
has
a
companion

If
you
lived
a
moral
life.
You
believe
that?
No.
No.
I'm
a...
I'm
a
scientist.
Why
did
you
name
your
comet
If
my
calculations
were
correct...
It
would
have
been
the
closest
approach
to
In
other
words,
like
your
mother...
A
near
miss.
What
does
that
mean?
I
was
going
I
had
a...

I
had
an
engagement
ring
in
my
pocket.
She
stood
me
up.
A
near
miss.
Good
night.
William.
She
loved
you,
too.
ELLIS:
Wow.
And
we
just
met,
right?
And
I
should
probably
I'll
just
shut
up.
Come
on.
What?
What
is
it?

I
can't
imagine
I
know
it's
probably
the
last
thing
But
I'm
falling
in
love
with
you,
Jenny.
I
can't
help
it.
I...
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
Um...
I
wasn't
expecting...
Please
don't
say
anything,
all
right?

Oh,
hello.
Jenny.
Do
you
know
Yeah.
Kathy
and
Kikki
went
to
the
market
-
Okay.
-
It's
all
right.
It's
a
ladybug.
Oh,
they
say
Did
you
get
it?
-
I
got
it.
Please
tell
Ellis




Oh!
-
Della,
are
you
okay?
This
is
going
to
sting
Okay.
Just
do
it
quickly.

-
Don't
worry.
I'm
going
to
fix
you
up.
Oh,
my
God.
YOUNG
WILLIAM:
Excuse
me.
Hi.
Uh,
do
you
mind
taking
our
photo?
-
Sure.
No,
it's
okay.
I
don't...
-
It's
going
to
be
great.
Come
on.
-
No,
you're
going
to
love
it.
We're
not
wasting
it.
I'm
just
very
shy.
Three,
two,
one.
Please.
I'm
hopeless.

I
know.
WILLIAM:
I
know
who
you
are,
Adaline.
ADALINE:
What?
The
scar.
The
same
scar.
I
stitched
it
myself.
Please.
The
truth.

William.
I
thought
I
was
losing
my
mind.
How?
How
is
this
possible?
I...
I
don't
know.

I
was
normal.
And
then
one
day,
I
wanted
to
tell
you
But
I
couldn't.
You
know
what
they
would
do
to
me.
A
curiosity.
-
A
specimen.
That's
why
you
left?
That's
why
you
disappeared?
-
Oh.
You
can't
imagine
Oh...
I
think
I...
I
think
I
can.
And
you've
never
No.
If
I
had,
Don't.
Don't
run
away.
Don't
disappear
again,
please.
For
Ellis.
-
Adaline.
All
these
years,
you've
lived,
Please,
for
yourself.
For
Ellis.
Stay,
Adaline.
I
don't
know
how.
Don't
run
away,
Adaline.
Adaline!




Adaline,
don't.
Please
don't
do
this.
Adaline,
don't.
Adaline,
please!
Adaline!


Dad!
Dad!
Dad,
where
are
your
keys?
She's
gone.
She's
not
coming
back,
son.
What
just
happened?
Dad,
what
the
hell
did
you
say
to
her?
Nothing.
She
can't
explain.
Please
tell
me
That

grew
up.

understand

greater
ambition
in
life
than
to
be
the
best
possible
husband
