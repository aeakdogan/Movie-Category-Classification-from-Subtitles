You

All

Nate.
I
found
a
housekeeper
for
you.
I
think
she's
perfect
for
you.
I
don't
know
if
I
could
eat
Well,
she'll
cook
you
She'll
try
to
make
sense
of
that

George,


No.
Oh,
never

We'll

If
you
leave
them
alone,
It's
a
good
arrangement.
-
What
are
we
reading?
What
is
this?
-
From
me.
-
Are
you
still
mad
at
him?
He's
neat,
and
they
say
he
saved
-
He's
funny.

Look,
we're
reading
Black
Beauty,
I've
got
enough
to
worry
about.
-

What?
We're
not
little
anymore.
I
know
you're
not
little
and
you're
afraid
of
coyotes.
You've
got
it
all
backwards.
Go
brush
your
teeth.
Did
it.
Ohh.

Oh,
Al!
Do
you
Yeah.
There's
been
a
lot
since
George
saw...
The
word's
spreading,
Ma.
You
just
believe
what
you
want
-

Hey,
I
thought
we
were
No.

-
Stop
talking
about
him,
all
right?
-

Because
I
like
him.

But
if
he
was
sitting
Wondering
what's
he
thinking?
When's
he
gonna
leave?
Is
he
gonna
leave?
Hmm?
-
We
don't
need
that.
It's
okay.
Shh.

He
found
the
kid
and
left--
Twenty
minutes,
he
read
the
whole

marmoset,
Newfoundland,
ocelot,
varmint,

little
pieces.
I

They
say
you
haven't
slept.
Who's

I'm
all
right.
You
know,
you're
a
pretty
gifted
man,
-

Well,
I
was
kind
of
hopin'
Something
useful
in
our
world.

Your
world?
Ah,

no.
It's
home
for
me,
Jack.
I
mean,
I
want
my
life.
I-I
want
my
life.

-
It's
not
what
I
want.
They
want
to
feel
safe.
They
don't
feel
safe
Whoa.
Why
would
they?
They've
been
Secret
codes.
I
shouldn't
be
listening
to
a
code
These
are
our
allies!
I-If

here,
Or
I'll

It
has
nothing
to
do
Oh,
I
know.
But
that's
But
he
is
considered
I'll
be
frank
with
you.
We'd
feel
better,
if
he
wasn't
granted
any
access
where
sensitive
government
projects

Access?

-

Lace!
-
I-It's

but
I
was
so
afraid

Are
you
all
right?
-

-
I'm
so
glad
they
let
you
go.
But
they--
they
are
I
think
I
scare
them.
You
scare
me
too.
I
do?
Hmm.

It's
getting
really
I
just
don't
know
I
should
probably
I--
I
guess
so.
I'll
see
you.


Hey.
-
You
want
a
beer,
George?
Look,
Nate.
I
am
really
sorry
I
told
them
everything,
George.
I
told
them
everything
Well,
you
know,
that's
-
I
mean,
you
know,
it's,
uh--
And
you're
just
sittin'
there.
And
then
all
of
a
sudden,
You
don't
know
It's
all
right.
What'd
they
do
to
you,
George?

Wh-What'd
they
find
out?

-

-
How
what
feels?
I
mean,
you
know,
you're
ready
Y-You
know,
uh,
this
professor,

You're
not
going

thought,
huh?
You
mean
inventions?
No,
no,
ideas.
Okay?
E-Every
d-damn
minute!
Okay?
And
little
'what
if'
ideas,
all
right?
I-I
got
you--
ideas
for
you,
Look
at
this.
Your
parking
lot.
Now,
if
you
just
You
can
put
six
more
cars
in,
All
right?
Where's
Paulette?
Bonnie.
Here.
Take
this.
Now,

she
does
this,
she
can
Imagine!
3:00.
Oh,

may
be
the
most

what
that
light
was?

a
damn
alien!

I
know
what
it
is,
Nate.

Okay?
It
was
supposed
Someone
who's
a
leader.

I'm
sorry.

Okay.
It's
Banes.
He
says
Sorry.
Well,

Little
bit
scared,
I
guess.

Jesus
Christ.
They'll
forget.
Their
cars
-
Hi.
Hi.
Energy
vibrations?

I
don't
know.
-
Yeah,
maybe.
Uh,
maybe,
yeah.
Look,
look.
I--
I
was
mad,
Good.
I'll
sound
the
all
clear,
Jesus,
George.
-
You
owe
me
a
CAT
scan.
-
Also,
you
look
like
hell.
They
won't
give
me
a
chance
I
look--
I
look
at
them,
-
Give
them
some
time,
George.
Now,
you
look
at
this.
Now,
look
at
that.
Now,
I-I'm
I-I
can
take
up
to
30
books
And
I
told
them
I'd
be
part
of
this.
-
Pressure
is
way
up
there.
You
know,
'Meet
George
Malley.'
-
Uh,
like
a
circus
attraction.
You
know,
I--
See,
I-I
can
explain
I-I
could
share
my
ideas
with
Come

you
all
your
life:

Give
it!
Come
on!

Al!
What've
you
got
there?
Hey.
That's
dangerous,
sweetie.

He
bought
it.
It's
a
piece
of
the
mirror
George
broke.
-
Oh,
you're
kidding.
-
That's
not
hot!
-
and
put
this
man
in
his
place.
Like
he's
not
human.
That's
really
dumb.
Can't
they
just
look
in
his
eyes
Do
you
remember
when
Daddy
left,
Even
our
so-called
friends?
Remember
how
much
it
hurt?
How
much
you
pay
for
that?
-
A...
quarter.
-
What's

of

Mr.Malley?
Good
to

You

sorrowful.
No.
What's
the

How
did
you,
uh,
manage
Oh,
I
found
my
pace.
Simple
thing,
really.
Why,

What
I
figure
about
you...
is
that
you're
stalling.
I'm
not
stalling,
though.

For
what?

Ah.
Yeah.
You
pick
good
people.
You
bet.
See,
uh--
George.
George.
There's
a
tumor
-

Threads
of
it,
But
instead
of
dysfunction--
Instead
of
destroying
so
far,
it's
been
stimulating
it.
And
we
can't
understand
that.
You
have
more

of

Ever.
B-Because
I
mean,
we've
seen
tumors
And
it
explains
the--
the
illusion
of

But
the
way
it's
in
there,
it's
a...
big
mystery,
so--
And
it's
killing
me.
