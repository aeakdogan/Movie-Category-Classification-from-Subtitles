shagging.
A
mini-breakmeans
true
love.
Suddenly
feel
like
in
manner
of
Grace
Kelly.
Though
perhaps
ever
so
slightly
It's
very
quiet
here,
isn't
it?
We
have
a
wedding
this
weekend.
I
believe
there
are
just
Oh.
Hmm.
NATASHA:
You
do
the
boats,
Oh,
Jesus.
-
Hello
there.
MARK:
Well,
well.
I
take
it
you're
also
heading
Yes,
that's
right.
I
brought
Natasha.
Thought
I
might
make
it
How
interesting.
What
a
gripping
life
DANIEL:
Lll
see
you
Hmm.
Well,
the
weakness
lies
in
the
deposition
BRIDGET:
Season
of
mist...
and...
mellow
fruitlessness.
Oh,
fuck
me,
I
love
Keats.
Have
you
heard
this
one?
"There
was
a
young
woman
"who
had
a
peculiar
feeling.
"She
lay
on
her
back
"and
pissed

BRIDGET:
What've
you
done?
-
I'm
boarding
you,
Bridge.
-
I'm
king
of
the
world!
Fuck
me.
Uhh!
BRIDGET:
Aah!

DANIEL:
Oh,
piss
and
bollocks.
You
stupid
ass.

Bollocks.
All
right.
Aah!
No!
So
childish.
BRIDGET:
Aah!
No!
Yes.
DANIEL:
The
water's
lovely!
Come
on,
you're
working
Ha
ha!
-
Daniel.
That
thing
you
just
did
in
several
countries.
Well,
that
is,
of
course,
I'm
so
thrilled
to
be
Yes.
I
can't
understand...
why
the
Prime
Minister
in
his
speeches.
You
should
write
BRIDGET:
I
intend
to.
Daniel.
DANIEL:
Bridget.
-
Do
you
love
me?
Do
you
love
me?
Right.
You
asked
for
it.
DANIEL:
And
over
we
go.
I'm
going
to
give
you
Here.
OK?
Pop
this
in
your
mouth,

You're
begging
for
it.

BRIDGET:
Stop
it.

No,
no.
Hmm.
I
got
to
go
back
to
town.
On
a
Sunday?
DANIEL:
No.
The
meeting's
I've
got
to
work
We
could
just
pop
DANIEL:
Bridget,
I
just
can't
do
it.
Listen,
Daniel...
if
you've
changed
your
mind,
because,
honestly,
I
don't
see
No,
well,
you
wouldn't,
Because
you
don't
have
of
just
how
much
trouble
You
swan
in
and
your
sexy
and
fanny
around
You
know,
this
is
because
they're
thinking
for
fuck's
sake.
Sorry.
I'm
sorry,
Bridge.
Look,
I'm
going
to
come
and
pick
you
up
to
London
after
the
party,
OK?
If
you
have
to
travel
alone,
Hmm.
And,
um...
I
also
think
that
you
win
Good.
Good
start.
Now,
then,
Miss
Jones,
BRIDGET:
Trying
hard
of
Mum
and
Auntie
Una
Seems
unnatural,
wrong
even,
as
prostitutes
and
priests


JULIELONDONSINGING:
BRIDGET:
Oh,
holy
Jesus.
Bridget.
Where
are
all
the
other
UNA:
Oh,
dear.
Didn't
you
telephone
How's
my
little
Bridget?
GEOFFREY:
Bop,
bop.
Oh.
Geoffrey.
So,
where's
this
chap
Ah,
yes,
well,
Ha!
A
likely
tale.
Off
they
run.
Whee!

JULIELONDONSINGING:
Bizarre
what
some
men
Oh,
God.
MUM:
Darling!
What
on
earth
are
you
wearing?
You
look
like
Yes,
well,
that
was,
Say
hi
to
Julian.
Hello,
Julian.
My
dear...
you
and
your
mother
JULIAN:
It's
what
I
call
the
sort
of
thing
one
can
wear
Oh.
Have
you
spoken
to
my
dad?
Yes.
He's
behaving
I
think
he
was
actually
with
Penny
Husbands-Bosworth,
She
was
very
frightened.
She's
only
just
had
I
don't
know
what
Shh.
Bad
man.


Heh
heh.
Didn't
tell
you,
either.

No.
I
didn't
spend
as
much
BRIDGET:
Oh.
I'm
sorry,
Dad.
The
way
she
looked
at
me.
Well,
she
loves
you,
really.
You
love
each
other.
This
is
only
a
temporary
glitch.
Is
it?
I
don't
know.
DAD:
I
don't
know.
UNA:
Ah,
Bridget,
there
you
are.
Don't
worry.
This
is
Penny.
Geoffrey
didn't
I'm
sorry?
I
was
just
saying
Geoffrey
to
tell
you
that
had
gone
out
of
the
window.
Oh,
yes,
he
did.
Oh,
right.
Lovely
dress.
Very
exotic.
What
a
shame
you
couldn't
What's
his
name?
MARK:
Daniel
Cleaver.
Oh.
Is
he
a
friend
Absolutely
not.
I
hope
he's
good
enough
I
think
I
can
say
with
Well,
I'm
sure
he'd
say
given
your
past
behaviour.
Sorry?
I
think
you
know
what
I
mean.
Mark.
BRIDGET:
Hmm.
didn't
get
the
message,
either.

Hi.
I
really,
really
wanted
Oh,
now,
listen,
I
have
an
idea.
while
you
go
home,
and
I'll
call
round,

Is
there
someone
here?
Not
that
I'm
aware
of.
Unless
that
Bosnian
family
Bastards.

Oh.
I'm
sorry.
Sorry.
I'm
going
mad.
Listen,
I
am
feeling
-
I
should've
been
there
today.
No,
no,
I'm
sorry...
but
at
least
I
got
Just
give
me
one
more
hour,
OK?
Fine.
That's
fine.
I
will
go
home
and
de-bunny.
Oh...
and
you
know
last
night
Mm-hmm.
I
didn't
mean
it.
I
was
being
ironic.
Oh,
God,
yeah,
All
right.
-
Thank
you,
madam.

Bridge.
Bridget.
This
is
Lara
from
Lara,
this
is
Bridget.
Hey,
there.
LARA:
ALEX:
I
was
hoping
that

DAN:
This
is
totally

I'm
36years
old.
It
may
be
Alex.
Aah!

Right.
BRIDGET:
We've
had
to
the
Teddy

Best
and
had
various
Look,
Bridge,
stop
that.
DANIEL:
I
feel...
terrible.
The
thing
is...
with
Lara
and
me...
well,
you
know...
No.
You'll
have
to
fill
me
in.
Well,
the
truth
is...
the
truth
is,
we're
the
same,
You
know?
We're
two
people
Iooking
for
the
moment
to
commit
And
I
just
think
it's
got
to
be
something
which
makes
us
And
I
think...
Lara
and...
I
don't
know,
it
has
something
to
do
well,
young,
you
know?
Well,
we've...
become
very
close.
Well,
you've
only
just
met
her.
Uh...
Oh.
Silly
Bridget.
You
haven't
only
just
met
her.
DANIEL:
No.
No.
I
got
to
know
her
when
we
were
Oh.
There's
no
easy
way
I
wanted
you
to
be
the
first
we're
engaged.
BRIDGET:
continuing
with
one's
life
and
eating
the
entire
I
have
two
choices...
to
give
up
and
accept
permanent
and
eventual
eating
by
dogs...

And
this
time,
I
choose
not.
I
will
not
be
defeated...
by
a
bad
man
Instead,
I
choose
vodka...
and
Chaka

Any
time
you

Why
do
you
want
Well,
I've
realized
that
to
communicating
the
up-to-the-moment
both
political
and
ecological.
What
do
you
think
of
BRIDGET:
Um...
it's
a
blip.
I
think,
basically,
So,
why
do
you
want
Because
I'm
to
communicating
with
children.
They
are
the
future.
Oh,
Christ,
no.
Yuck!

BRIDGET:
Ah.
Sorry.
MAN:
So,
why
do
you
want
I've
got
to
leave
my
current
job
Fair
enough.
We'll
see
how
we
go.
Oh,
and...
incidentally...
at
"Sit
Up,
Britain"...
no
one
ever
gets
sacked
That's
a
matter
of
principle.
Oh,
Bridget.
Come
on,
it's...
I
mean,
I
know
it's
been
but
there's
no
need
to
leave.
No,
actually,
there
is.
I've
been
offered
Television?
Mmm.
And
they
want
me
So
I've
got
to
leave
so,
um...
Whoa.
Just
hold
it
I'm
sorry
to
inform
you...
but
I
think
you'll
find
you're
expected
to
give
BRIDGET:
Ah,
yes,
well...
I
thought
with
the
company
being
you
wouldn't
really
miss...
the
person
who
waltzes
in
and
fannies
about
Bridget.
I
want
to
hear
this,
I'm
going
to
fire
for
being
totally
spineless.
What?
Well,
I
just
think
there
are
lots
of
prospects
Just
give
me

minute,
Right-o,

Lots
of

No,
it
didn't.
I'm
delighted
to
hear
it.
Look,

I'm
sorry

What?
I
don't
think
I
mean,
there
are
elements
Your

And
you
really
are...
an
appallingly
bad
And
you
tend
to
let
come

mouth...
without
much
consideration
I
realize
that
when
I
met
you
that
I
was
unforgivably
rude
that
my
mother
had
But
the
thing
is,
um...
what
I'm
trying
to
say
that,
um...
in
fact...
perhaps,
despite
appearances...
I
like
you
very
much.
Ah.
Apart
from

No.
I

be
sacked.
Did
the
others
get
interviews?
I
don't
know.
Actually,
nobody
got
interviews.
How
do

know?
Because
I
was

and
I
told
him
Look...
MARK:
I
have
a
plan.
And
action.
Mr.
Darcy,
You
must
be
delighted.
Yes,
well,
Kafir

been
the
result
by

Huh.
But
I
see
I
may
have
come
How's
it
look?
Great.
It's,
um...
blue.

Blue?
MARK:
No,
but
blue
is
good.
If
you

me,
Oh,

We
can
have
blue
soup
to
start,
well,
for
main
course,
uh,
congealed

-
That
is
caper

gravy.
-
Do
you
have
eggs?
Right.
-
Omelette

With
