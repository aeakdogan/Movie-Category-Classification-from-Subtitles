Coming

Whoa!

BRIAN:
Brian

A-ha!

Eyes

Whoa!
No!
You
lose,

Too
slow,

Oh,

Right.
BRIAN:
Time
for

I

Clever.

Oh,
look,
I'll
be
back

a
minute.
Hello.
Science.
English?

What
about
you?
Oh,
cosmologist,
What's
that?
It's
a
kind
of
religion
Intelligent
atheists?
You're
not
religious,
C

I
suppose
someone
has
to
be.
What
do
cosmologists
What
do
we
worship?
One
single
that
explains
everything
Really?
What's
the
equation?
That
is
the
question.
And
a
very
good
question.
I'm
not
quite
sure
yet.
But
I
intend
to
find
out.
JANE:
Then
why
didn't
you
Because
my
finals
exams
that
the
examiners,
and
they
told
me
that
What's
a
viva?
Oh,
it's
a
sort
of
mildly
Like
an
interview?
And
I
told
them
that
if
they
then
I
would
stay
with
them
But
if
they
gave
me
then
they
would
never
They
gave
you
the

They
gave
me
a

This
party
Come
on,
Come
on,
Jane.

Jane.
Well,
it
was
lovely
Yes.
And
I
hope
you
find
Yes.
Oh.
Ah.

STEPHEN:
Bye.


Stephen?
Yeah.

Well,
then,
here
we
are.
A
little
challenge
as
you

Good

With

If

Is
it

I
have

It's
Lou

Sorry,
I'm

I
have

Sorry?
It
does
sound
odd
when
you
You...
What
do
you
mean?
No,
you
don't.

Sorry,
I
don't
really,
um...
Will
you
go,
Bri?
Stephen,
sorry,


Will
you
go?

Stephen,
phone
for
you.
It's
a
girl.
Um...
I'll...
I'll...
Um...
I'll
see
you
soon.
Yes.
She's
waiting.

Stephen?

Nobody's
seen
him
I
suppose,
you
know...
Jane.Jane.
Brian,
hello.
Why
don't
you...
I'm
so
sorry.
I
spoke
to

and
I
know
that


Something
educational?
Very.
John
is
having

Well,
I'm
just
trying
Are
you

Go.
Croquet.
Play
a

with

Go.
If
you
don't
get
up
I
won't
come
back
Ever.
Come
on.

Leave
me
now.
Are
you
going
to
talk
Will
you
just
go?
Is
that
what
you
want?
So,
please,
if
you
care
I
can't.
I
need
to
work.

I
want
us
to
be
together
and
if
that's
not
It'll
have
to
do.
It'll
affect
everything.

Your

There.
That's
better,
isn't
it?
Yes.
Yes,
it
is.

Now

Oh,

be
careful.

I

Two,
three...

Good
luck.
Morning,
Stephen.
SCIAMA:
I
know,
I
know.
THORNE:
It
could
be
SCIAMA:
Yes,
but
I...

Come
in,
Stephen.

SCIAMA:
I
know
it's
something
we
but
I...
I
knew,
Roger...
You
had
some
reservations
Yes,
but
it's
not
uncommon
Yes.
Absolutely.
Very
well,
SCIAMA:
Welcome,
Stephen.
Would
you
like
No,
I'm
fine.
Thank
you.
SCIAMA:
You're
sure?
So,
Stephen,
as
we
know,
chapter
one,
lacks
mathematical
support.
Professor
Thorne?
Uses
a
lot
of
Roger's
ideas.
Well,
at
least
Uh,
chapter
three,
too
many
SCIAMA:
I
agree.
And
then,
of
course,
This
black
hole
at
Space-time
singularity.
It's
brilliant.
Superb.
Therefore,
all
there
is
Or
perhaps
I
should
say,
well
done,
Doctor.
PENROSE:
SCIAMA:
An
extraordinary
theory.

So,
what
next?
Prove
it.
To
prove
with
that
time
has
a
beginning.
Wouldn't
that
be
nice,
The
one
simple,
to
explain
everything.
Yes,
it
would.
It
would
indeed.
Thank
you.
JANE:
To
the
esteemed
Doctor...

Doctor
Stephen
Hawking.
ALL:
Doctor
Stephen
Hawking.
Thank
you.
It
is
astonishing
he's
the
first
bearing
in
mind
how
little

BRIAN:
Work
was
the
worst
At
Oxford
especially,
An
hour
a
day,
And
now,

is,
Astonishing

CARTER:
I've
got...
how
many
of

When
you've
been
doing
research
BRIAN:
Absolutely,
completely...
CARTER:
How
many?

Everything
all
right?
I'm
fine.


Would

Oh,

ELLIS:

Hey,

It's
okay,
Robbie.








This
is
temporary.
Of
course.

Well,
it's
convenient

Thank
you.

Sorry,
I
said...
Yes?

you.

we
go.

There
we

She
looks

I'll
be

JANE:
Oh,

I've
got
an
idea.

Jane,
I've
had
an
idea.
Hello.
Hello,
Dennis.
Okay.
Good
luck.
SCIAMA:
He'll
be
fine.
Oops.
Sorry.
No
problem.

Allowing
us
to
predict
that
some
particles
can,
So,
black
holes
but
glow
The
steady
emission
causes
the
black
holes
and
eventually
they
disappear
It's
very,
very
simple,
in
the
Second
law
of
thermodynamics.

If
we
can
imagine
is,
indeed,
and
over
time,
Disappear.
So
first
a
star
vanishes
And
then
the
black
hole
itself
vanishes.
Gone,
nothing.
From
nothing
to
nothing!
You
owe

have

Now,

I'd
like
to

sound
a
bit
unusual,
I
think
that
you
should
consider

Maybe
so.
I
