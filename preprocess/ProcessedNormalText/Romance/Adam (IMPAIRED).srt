My
favorite
children's
book
who
came
to
Earth
from
a
distant
asteroid.
He
meets
a
pilot
The
little
prince
teaches
the
pilot
many
things...
but
mainly
about
love.
My
father
always
told
me
But
after
I
met
Adam...
I
realized
I
was
the
pilot
all
along.

-
Morning,
Adam.
-
Good
morning,
Lulu.

-

Say
anything.
Adam
Raki
is
the
cutest
guy
in
the
office.
-
That's
fine.
-

Good
morning,
Mr.
Klieber!
-

Good
morning.
-
How
did
she
do
that?
How
did
she
know
it
was
me
Voice
recognition.
I
put
in
voice
patterns
from
some
people
SPLICE
stands
for
"Stereo-based
Piece-wise
-
It's
an
algorithm
that
I
placed
Did
Chatty
Patty
have
SPLICE?
Did
Big
Mouth
Billy
Bass
have
SPLICE?
But
you
said
I
could
make
her
sound
like
Kelli.
I
said
she
could
sound
like
Kelli.
She
doesn't
have
free
will.
5,000
at
a
hundred
dollars,
-
Good-bye,
Mr.
Klieber.

that
lies
between
fame
and
craft...
between
the
public
persona
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
an
actress
we
admire...
Julia
Roberts.


Perfect.
-
Oh.
I
mean,
to
residents.
Do
you
have
a
key?
Uh,
yes.
I
just
moved
in.
Beth
Buchwald,
3A.
Adam.
Second
floor.
Two.
You're
not
doing
your
laundry?
Oh.
Um,
yeah.
Looks
like
a
bit
of
an
emergency.
Would
you
mind
letting
me
in?
-
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Sure.
I
mean,
I
loved
it.
Downtown's
my
hood.
But
this
place
is
bigger
Can
you
see
the
sky
from
the
third
floor?
I
guess
I
would
if
the
windows
Some
nerve,
right...
calling
a
school
in
the
middle
of
Manhattan
It's
just
temporary,
actually.
The
job,
not
the
name
of
the
school.
I'm
a
writer.
For
children.
What
do
you
do?
Uh,
I
help
make
toys.
Oh,
you're
an
elf?

-

No,
I've
got
one.
Funny.
I
think
I
left
mine
upstairs
in
my
packet.
Could
I
borrow
yours
for
now?
Okay.

Thanks.
Good.
Good
work,
Beth.
Hi,
neighbor.
There
are
new
images
of
Saturn
Oh.
God.
I
always
wish
I
knew
more
about
space.
You
did?
Like
what?
I
don't
know.
You
know,
what's
out
there.
You
have
to
narrow
that
down.

Well,
I
have
books,
telescopes,
star
charts.
You
could
borrow
some
stuff.
We
could
go
out,
Maybe
sometime.
Sure.
-
Okay.
Well,
I'll
just
be
hauling
these
enormous
Okay.
Okay.


What
are
you
doing?
Oh.
People
watching.
Anyone
in
particular?
Just
people.
Listen,
I'm
going
out
with
some
friends
Oh.
They're
people,
Uh-huh.
But
if
not,
you
know,
that's
fine.
No,
I
want
to
go,
-
Okay,
if
you're
busy.
I
mean,
it's
not
a
date.
It's
just
a
little
When?
8:00.
8:00-ish.
Uh-huh.
Look,
there's
no
pressure.

I'll
just
knock
on
your
door
-
Okay.
-
Yeah.





Adam?


Adam.

-

See
you
later!

I-I'm
sorry
I
didn't
come
out
with
your
friends.
No
problem.
I
get
kind
of
overloaded.
I
have
something
to
show
you.
Come
in.
Come
in.

Oh,
my!
You
said
you
want
to
know
more
about
space.
Because
it
looks
like
this
even
though
we
know
its
expanding.
All
parts
of
the
universe
most
of
them
faster
than
the
speed
of
light,
I
thought
nothing
went
faster
Right,
right.
Nothing
goes
Um,
uh,
do
you
know
about
the
Big
Bang?
A
little.
In
the
beginning,
God
crea
The
inflation
theory
says
the
Big
Bang
came
about
14
billion
years
ago...
that
expanded
to
the
size
of
the
universe
Ten
to
the
minus-39?
A
decimal
point,
39
zeros,
and
then
a
one.
That's
the
fraction
of
a
second
That's
billions
and
billions
of
times
Ooh,
that's...
fast.
Yeah.

Wow!
Uh,
these
are
all
pictures
of
stars
and
galaxies
for
hundreds
of
millions
or
billions
of
years.
But
that's
still
nearby
compared
to
Never?
Well,
things
that
move
apart
faster
than
light
because
the
light
from
one
After
the
Big
Bang...
the
expansion
of
the
universe
slowed
down.
But
then,
after
seven
billion
years...
for
some
reason
it
speeded
up
again...
and
it's
been
speeding
up
ever
since.
Someday
everything
you
see
here
And
eventually
the
night
sky...
will
be
almost
completely
dark.
That's
kinda
sad.
Sad?
Hmm.
I-I
have
been
talking
too
much,
so
No,
it's...
fascinating.
-
But
I
talk
too
much
when
I
get
excited.
It's
It's
amazing.
Well,
I-I
could
tell
you
quickly
Oh,
no,
it's
okay.
Maybe
next
time.
Okay.
It's
very
speculative.
Well,
I
should
go.
Good
night,
Beth.
Good
night.
Thanks.
I
love
your
planetarium.
Oh.

You're
welcome.

Oh,
I
could
have
waited,
Daddy.
Not
another
day.
-
They
were
mice.
It's
okay.
It's
not
like
the
Village.
-
It's
new.
You
were
in
someone's
living
room.
He's
cute.
He
lives
in
the
building.
Whatever
happened
to
Rich
Lippmann?
Not
going
there.
But
what
was
the
name
of
his
company?
Okay.
Okay.
So,
your
neighbor's
an
astronomer?
No,
he's
an
electronic
engineer,
-
But
he
hasn't
even
said
hello
to
me
No,
it's
me.
Didn't
anyone
tell
you
and
Mom
spoilt,
too
trusting
and
unequipped
to
cope?
What
were
you
thinking?
That
we
had
one
perfect
child.
How's
school?
We
just
started.
"The
course
of
civilization
is
a
race
-
John
F.
Kennedy.
Well,
if
you
marry
an
investment
banker...
you
could
do
whatever
you
want.
Rich
Lippmann
is
a
dick,
Daddy.
Don't
say
"dick"
to
your
father.
No
one's
perfect,
Bethy.
That's
all
I'm
saying.
But
their
sensor
systems
have
detected
Adam,
I'm
having
lunch.
-
Speak
English.
You
see,
the
Star
Tracker
system
is
-
No.
No
more
background
radiation
Lunchtime
is
for
guy
talk.
Two
guys
talking
about
women,
-
But
the
Star
Tracker
system
Hmm.
A
woman
moved
into
3A.
All
right.
Now,
that's
lunch
talk.
So?
So,
that's
all.
Come
on.
A
woman
moved
into
3A.
She
looked
She
looked
nice.
Good.

Good!
-
Uh,
you
gonna
meet
her?
You
did?
We
did
laundry.
She
came
to
my
apartment.
-
She
did?
-
Oh,
Jesus.
How'd
she
take
it?
She
Well,
bless
my
stars.
You
gonna
see
her
again?
I
see
her
almost
every
day.
You
talk
to
her
again?
No.
Adam.
You're
the
man.
You
have
to
start
the
conversation.
-
I
can't
do
that.
H-How
Hmm.
This
jackass
locked
himself
out
of
his
car.
Figures
he
can
cuss
me
out
on
the
phone.
Well,
he
ought
to
be
chilled
by
now.
-

Follow
through,
young
man.
Follow
through.
Are
you
and
Mom
still
going
to
Barbados
this
year?
-
Well,
we're
still
deciding.
There's
a
little
problem
-
Between
you
and
Mom?
-
At
the
firm.
There
was
an
indictment
last
March.
There
was
an
indictment
of
the
firm?
No,
of
me,
personally,
no
less.
It's
nothing.
But
there's
a
trial
date
now.January
19.
-
A
trial?
But
bullshit,
if
you'll
excuse
the
expression...
expands
to
fill
the
allotted
time...
so
now
Barbados
is
up
in
the
air.

Daddy!
Don't
worry.
But
if
you
happen
to
come
up
we
may
need
it
to
pay
the
ganef
lawyers.
-
Over
Friday
for
dinner,
right?
-
I
love
you,
Daddy.

Beth?
Adam!
I'm
so
sorry.
Oh,
that's
okay.
Come
out
with
me.
I
wanna
show
you
something.
Beth?
-
Adam,
the
park's
closed.
-
I
wanna
go
back!
I'm
not

Adam,
I
Raccoon
in
Central
Park?
That
was
so
cool.
What
are
they
doing
here?
Foraging.
-
How
did
you
know
where
they'd
be?
I
used
to
come
and
watch
them
a
lot.
It's
quiet.
They
don't
really
belong
here,
They're
coming
back
around
in
a
little
while.
Yeah,
sure.

Yes.
That's
all
right.
I
startled
you.
Yes.
I
just
wanted
to
tell
you
what
a
good
job
Well,
that's
good.
When
your
father
explained
your
When
he
explained
your...
things...
well,
I
had
my
my
doubts,
A
man
of
your
background
at
the
salary
you're
-
Well,
that's
good.
But
the
world
is
changing.
-
You've
got
to
compete.
5,000
at
a
hundred,
not
five
at
a
thousand.
Adam,
I've
got
to
let
you
go.
But
I
will
write
you
a
recommendation
-
L-Let
me
go?
Yeah,
but
I
I
don't
wanna
go.
I
have
a
bid,
Adam.
It's
done.
-
You
found
a
better
chip?
Cheaper.
Look,
go
home.
Talk
it
over
with
your
dad.
-
I'm
sure
he'll
find
you
another
job.
Kelli
has
your
severance.
And
I
mean
that
sincerely.
Good-bye,
Adam.

Adam,
dude.
Sorry
about
that,
man.
Don't
think
about
it,
bro.
I'm
so
sorry,
Adam.
See
you
around,
okay?




Excuse
me,
sir.
What
are
you
doing
there?
-
I
said,
what
you
doin'?
Uh-huh.
Let
me
have
some
I.D.,
sir.
I-I-I
was
looking
at
the
children.
Sir,
turn
around.
-
WhyWhy
are
you
doing
this?
Turn
around!
Hands
on
the
fence.
WhatWhat

you
doing?
I'm
taking
your
wallet

of
your
back
pocket

5-Adam
to
Central-K,
-
Is
this
the
man
you
reported?
Where
do
you
live,
sir?
Please
stay
where
you
are.
Do
you
live
or
do
you
have
business
Everything's
fine.
Go
on
back
inside.
-

-
Are
you
the
one
who
reported
this?
-
What's
going
on?
Yeah,
he's
my
neighbor.
What
happened?
-
I
-
He's
clean.
Can't
be
too
careful
with
kids,
right?
You
can
go.
Adam!

-

Enough
with
the
presents,
okay?
Well,
that
was
kind
of
awful,
wasn't
it?
I
mean,
God,
you
just
stopped
by
-
Police
freak
me
out
too.
Okay?
Okay.
So,
you
live
alone?
Yes.
I
mean,
it's
it's
big
for
one
person.
For
the
city.
Well,
my
father
lived
here
too.
Oh!
Where
is
he
now?
-
Queens.
He
died
six
weeks
ago.
Oh,
God.
I'm
so
sorry.
My
friend
Harlan
says
Queens
because
they
can't
tell
the
difference.
That'sThat's
awful.
Harlan
said
it
was
a
joke.
Oh,
I
meant
about
your
father.
Uh
-
What
about
your
mother?
I'm
so
sorry.
I
had
a
really
nice
time
last
night
in
the
park.
Were
you
excited?
-
What?
Um
Uh,
no,
not
exactly.
Well,
I
ask
because
I
was,

Thank
you
so
much
for
the
glass
of
water.
I
I
should
I
should
be
going
now.
Because
I
said
that
thing
No!
No,
no.
I
just
Well

yeah.
Oh
Uh,
sometimes
i-i-it's
hard
for
me
to,
um
I
have
this
thing
It's
called
Asperger's
syndrome.
Oh.
One
thing
about
it
is
not
knowing
-
Like
right
now.
I
guess
I
was
wondering

Okay.
My
brain
works
differently
from
N.T.'s.
N.T.'s?
Neurotypicals.
Sometimes
I
can't
understand
them...
especially
when
they
mean
something
different
You
don't
do
that?
No,
most
Aspies
are
really
honest.
Uh,
psychologists
think
But
psychologists
are
mostly
N.T.'s.
Albert
Einstein,
Thomas
Jefferson,
Mozart,
They
had
Asperger's?
Probably.
When
I
was
younger...
I
would
have
just
thought
That's
called
mind
blindness.
I
had
to
learn
to
ask
I
understand.
It's
okay.
Oh.
I
re
I
really
should
go.
Okay.
I'm
really
sorry
about
your
father.
Oh.
Can
I
see
you
again?
Um,
well,
I'm
I'm
right
upstairs,
so
Great.
Okay.
I'll
see
you.

Hi.

-
Do
you
have
a
minute?
Thank
you.
Oh,
you
think
it's
a
bad
sign
bores
its
director?
Um
What
do
you
know
about
Asperger's
syndrome?
Oh.
Well,
it's
a
developmental
disorder,
What
does
that
mean
exactly?
Well,
there's
a
broad
range.
-
It
could
be
severe
social
interaction
problems.
Maybe
I
should
get
in
on
this,
Oh,
no,
no.
It's
my
neighbor.
He
has
it.
But
he's
really,
really
sweet...
and
kind
of
interesting.
Yeah,
sometimes
they
can
be
quite
brilliant.
It
is
on
the
autism
spectrum.
Oh,
you
know,
actually
I
think
I
have
a
This
is
a
first-person
account.
Oh,
no,
it's
it's
not
it's
not
serious
-
Hmm.
Okay.
Sure.
Oh,
Beth?
Would
you
Sure.
So,
you're
saying,
really,
-
Right?
Not
really.
-
Well,
well,
it
Thanks.
So,
um,
subtracting
your
father's
liabilities
uh,
credit
card
debt,
from
his
assets
reduces
the,
uh-
the
estate-
roughly,
$25,000.
And,
uh,
he
bequeathed
$5,000...
to
the
Kids
at
Risk
Music
Fund...
$
10,000
to
you,
Mr.
Keats.
Oh.
So,
as
his
primary
beneficiary,
AdamAdam?
Uh,
you
inherit
the
remainder.
That
would
be
the
death
benefit
from
Juilliard...
and
the
funds
from
the
T.I.A.A.
retirement
plan.
Also,
there's
approximately
-
So,
assuming
you
sell,
We
presumed
that
you'd
be
moving
Move?
Without
your
father's
income,
I
don't
wanna
move.
Easy.
Think
of
it
as
an
opportunity.
Uh,
Mr.
Wardlow...
Adam
has
never
been
out
of
the
city
Uh-huh.
Well,
uh,
closer
to
home
then.
-
With
the
income
from
your
job
Oh.
Oh,
I'm
sorry
to
hear
that.
That
makes
-
Changes
like
this
are
hard.
-
Mr.
Raki,
I
-
I'm
not
gonna
sell
my
house.
Cross
your
arms
over
your
chest.
Mr.
Wardlow,
are
we
done?
There
are
papers
to
be
signed.
-
Can
you
send
them?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We,
uhWe
can
do
that.
-
Come
on,
Adam,
let's
go.
I
can't
I
ca
I
can't
move.
All
right.
Come
on.
You're
not
10
years
old
anymore.
You
need
a
job.
-
I
got
fired.
You
know
how
many
times
I've
been
fired?
When
your
dad
and
I
came
back
from
the
service...

Day
one,
I
hate
the
freakin'
job.
Day
two,
I
hate
the
freakin'
boss.
Day
three,
I
hit
someone
I
didn't
hit
anyone.
I
never
hit
anyone.
Adam,
you're
29
years
old.
You
can't
pay
your
mortgage
So
what
are
you
gonna
do?

Hey,
Bethy-boo.
-
You
home
okay?
Call
us.

Look,
maybe
the
whole
point
was
for
me
-
You're
not
really
gonna
throw
this
awa-



A-Adam?
Wha
What?
Get
in
here!


Wh-What?
What
in
the
world
You
could
have
been
killed.
-
How
were
you
gonna
get
down?
-
Climb?
You
said
you
couldn't
see
out
of
your
windows.


Why
did
you
scream
like
that?
Because
I
walked
into
my
apartment
-
It
was
me!
Oh.
I
guess
not.
Thank
you
for
trying
to
You're
welcome.
Would
you,
um
Would
you
like
some
tea?
-
Uh
-
Uh,
sure.
Harlan
said
I
should
send
out
application
letters
Interviews?
Interviews
usually
don't
go
very
well.
But
you
put
in
some
applications?
Eighty-seven.
-
Eighty-seven?
Applications
and
letters
of
inquiry.
-
You
applied

Wow.
I

that's
a

Well,
I
don't

Yeah.
This

I'm
a
little
upset.
My
father's
an
accountant...
and
he's,
uh,
been
accused
Oh.
Did
he
do
it?
No.
No.
But
tonight
he
said
it
looks
like
and
I
know
that
your
father
just
passed
away,
Um,
I-I
I
can
see
that
you're
upset...
but
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
Could
you
give
me
a
hug?
Yes.
Adam,
I'd
like
you
to
give
me
a
hug.
"'But
he's
naked,

a
little

for
he
was
sure
"'I
must
bear
it
until
the
procession
is
over.'
And
he
walked
even
more
proudly
So,
what
do
we
think?
He
was
naked.

He
ran
around
the
whole
town
naked.
Yes,
okay,
he
was
naked.
Anything
else?
The
little
boy
was
bad.
Really?
Why
do
you
say
that,
Stephanie?
-
Because
he
told.
-
Bruce.
Don't
you
think
the
king
Well,
he
didn't
have
to
yell
it
out.
He
could
have
just
gone
over
to
him
Everybody
else
was
just
lying
and
because
they
were
afraid

-
Weenie!
I
like
the
boy.
I
do
too.

Maybe
we
should
go.
Our
table's
next.
You
can't
eat
macaroni
and
cheese
every

-
Why
not?

Thanks
for
coming.
I-I-I

it's
hard.
Okay.
This
is
better,
right?
Hello.
I'm

I

Would
you
like
It's
all
right.
Um,

we'd
like.
We'll
take
two
tricolored

one
grilled
salmon

lentils

And
Ron?
Sorry.
Rom.
Could
we
get
that
all
to

It's
macaroni

When

How's
the

hunt
going?
A
lot
of
them
were
already
taken.
I'm
still
getting
responses
though.
I'm
sure
the
right
thing
will
come
along.
How
can
you
be
sure
of
that?
I
mean,
I
hope
the
right
thing
comes
along.
My

I

No,
no.
It

No.

Thank
you.
You're
welcome.
Try
to
be

I
had
my
heart
broken
by
a

recently.
I
need
time
to
take

slowly.
What
did
he
do?
While
we
were
together,
Not
together
together,
Oh.
So,
I
need
to
take
things
slowly.

No
sex.
-
Kissing.
-
Holding.
And
no
sex.
Is
that
all
right?
Yes.

How
long
it
should
be
before
you
meet
Adam
You've
justYou
made
that
up.
Don't
worry
about
me.
I'm
fine.
Has
there
been
any
more
news
Okay.
Okay.
Sure.
I
will.
I'll
tell
him.
Okay.
I
love
you,
Daddy.
Bye.
You
can
stay
for
an
hour.
Well,
I'd
have
fun
at
home.
It's
not

Adam.

You
look
great.
Her
name
is
Ling
Yao,
-
That's
beautiful.
I
mean,
really,
she
is
young
enough.
-
Her
name
is
Ling
Yao.
-
Well,
that's
who
she
was
when
we
got
her.
-
I
know.
Look
at
her.
We
have
a
video,
of
course.
Would
you
like
to
see
the
video?
No,
thank
you.
Where's
the
bathroom?
Down
the
hall,
second
right.
I'd
love
to
see
the
video.
-
Oh,
so
now
you're
an
expert.
Tory,
you
don't
have
to
know
a
lot
about
Islam...
to
understand
hunger
or
We
don't
understand
who
these
people
are,
I
don't
understand
people
from
New
Jersey.
Look,
either
you
believe
that
human
beings
or
you
just
throw
the
towel
in.

-
You
should
focus
on
your
interests.
-
What?
Right.
A-Are
you
interested
Or
deeper
space-nebulae,
star
clusters,
galaxies.
Then
you
want
a
much
larger
lens

Uh,
the
eight-bar

Hi.
Michael's

for

you
could

about

Have
you
heard
too
much
about
telescopes?
No.
No.
I-It's
just
some
of
what
you're
saying
Oh.
Okay.
Well,
I'll
start
over.
Three
basic
considerations.
-
Kind
of
lens.
All
right.

Uh,
thank
you
for
the
information.

It's
a
very
big
decision.
And
you.
Wow.

the
other.
Laugh,
laugh,

New
topic.
Start
again.
I
started
outlining
my
new
book.
-
Really
excited.
You're
going
to
be
the
first
person
I
thank...
in
my
Newberry
Award
speech.
It's
an
award
for
children's
books.
No,
I
know
what
a
Newberry
Award
is.
Are
you
still
gonna
make
them
talk?
Mm-hmm.
They're
gonna
be
except
they
live
in
the
park,
Okay.
Your
turn.
I
think
the
father
is
gonna
be
in
advertising.
Instead
of
making
stuff
up...
why
couldn't
you
write
about
the
real
raccoons?
Because
it's
a
children's
book,
Well,
I'd
probably
like
the
nature
book
better.

Yeah,
you
probably
would.
What?
I
didn't
mean

This
is
what
I
meant.
Oh.
Um...
do
you,
um
do
you
want
sex?
I
think
I
do.
You
said
you
needed
time.
Well,
then
take
it
very,
very
slowly.



This
isn't
fair.
What's
fair?
It's
a
small
manipulation.
-
What,
you
aren't
curious?
But
if
he
isn't
ready
to
meet
us.
Yeah,
well,
sometimes
-
Beth?
Daddy!
Mom!
What?
-
We're
seeing
the
play.
-
What?
I
thought
we
had
your
tickets.
No,
we
were
going
with
the
Pierces,
Come
on!
We're
not
ogres.
-
This
is
Beth's
mother,
Rebecca.
I'm
Marty.
-
We've
heard
so
much
about
you.
-
Yeah.
Oh,
thank
you.
-
Me
and
my
little
girl,
we
are
thick
as
thieves.
Hi,
sweetie.
I
just
couldn't
wait
any
longer.
We
rarely
go
off-Broadway.
I
didn't
even
know
this
theater
still
existed.
Oh,
the
Cherry
Lane
Theatre
is
the
oldest
Um
It
was
converted
and-and
then
in
the
'20s
and
'30s
and
'40s...
it
presented
the
work
of
writers
John
Dos
Passos,
Eugene
O'Neill.
I
used
to
bone
up
on
conversation
topics,
too,
-
Marty!
From
1951
to
1953,
uh...
Julian
Beck
and
Judith
Malina's
Oh,
oh!
In
1952,
Judith
Malina
chased
with
a
spear
from
her
production
of
Ubu

Um,
Endgame,
by
Samuel
Beckett,

by
other
new
works
such
as
Happy
Days,

in
1964,
by
LeRoiJones...
The
Happy
journey
to
Trenton
and
Camden
B-But
that
that's
enough
Wh-What
about
the
'7
0s?
-
Well,
in
1971,
Godspell
opened
and
then
in
197
Oh.
Oh.
-
I'm
sorry.
History
is
always
very
interesting.
-

Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Shall
we?


Oh,
they're
dying
to
go
to
trial
Well,
it's-it's
written
all
over
them.
-
What
does
Mr.
Beranbaum
say?
Bottom
line,
if
the
feds
push
this
-
Right?
That's
why
you
don't
have
to
be
there.
-
You
said
it
would
help
if
we
showed
our
support.
Your
father's
right.
You
have
work.
Mom,
I'm
covered
at
work.
What
are
you
accused
of,
Mr.
Buchwald?
I'm
accused
of
trying
to
help
a
friend.
-
Beth's
Uncle
Eric-
-
made
his
daughter,
Jennifer,

I
mean,
she
went
to
Wharton.
Uncle
Eric's
not
really
my
uncle.
He's
an
old
friend
of
Daddy's,
She's
young.
She
made
a
few
mistakes.
I
carried
them
over
from
one
year
to
the
next...
made
her
look
a
little
better,
It
wasn't
even
a
hard
call
to
make,
-
Could
you
go
to
jail?
No.
I'm
glad
you
asked.
Bethy,
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
Any
more
questions,
Mr.
Prosecutor?
Uh,
no.
See?
He
fits
right
in.

You
put
him
on
the
spot,
Well,
I
I
didn't
understand
what
he
was
saying.
Maybe
that's
not
his
fault.
Monday
You
don't
talk
about
going
to
jail!
-
It
seemed
like
the
important
thing.
All
of
a
sudden
you
know
what's
important?
You
can't
say
two
words
but
you
know
what's
important
to
my
family.
-
I-I-I
do
-
Oh,
okay.
-
Beth?

May
I
come
in?
I'm
sorry.
It's
some
chocolate.
I'm
not
Forrest
Gump,
you
know.
Of
course
not.
I
didn't

Was
that
a
joke?
Are
you
joking?
I'm
sorry.
I
I
took
it
out
on
you.
You
can
apologize
too,
you
know.
Well,
you
said
it
was
your
fault.
I
got
an
interview.
You
did?
Halloran
Industries,
research
and
engineering...
for
space
communication
and
exploration.
Adam,
that's
that's
perfect!
Break
out
the
chocolate.
Well,
no,
it's
just
an
interview.
There's
a
saying
in
my
family:
You'd
be
good
at
this
job,
right?
So
all
you
gotta
do
is
let
'em
know
it.
That's
all?
That's
impossible.
When
is
it?
It
February
3
17

Right.
So
that's
how
long
you
got.
You
gotta
learn

I'm

Fine.

No,
she
isn't.
Marty
pled
guilty.
There's
some
discretion
in
sentencing.
TheThe
hearing
is
tomorrow.
We
may
have
to
make
statements,
I
called
the
school,
Do
you
know
when
she'll
be
home?
No.
I
thought
I
was
waiting
for
Adam,
please.
Can
you
check
her
calendars,
Okay.
Never
mind.
Marty's
coming.
I
have
to
go.
They'reThey're
keeping
him
overnight.
Tell
her
to
call
me
right
away.


Adam!
I've
been
thinking
about
you
all
afternoon.
I
forgot
my
phone.
How
did
the
interview
go?
Okay,
you're
right.
-
Right?
You
arranged?
I
knew
they
were
gonna
be
at
the
theater.
They
really
wanted
to
meet
you.
Now,
will
you
please
tell
me
what
happened?
You
lied?
Just
a
little.
Ha-ha-ha!
Fooled
you!
Dumb
Adam!
Dumb,
dumb,
dumb,
dumb
Adam!
Adam,
I
didn't
I
I'm
sorry.
I
-
Adam,
please
just
calm
down.
-
No!
-
I
hate
you!
He's
guilty!
Your
mother
called.
And
he's
a
liar
like
you,
You're
a
child,
Adam.

Liar!
A
long
time
ago,
when
I
told
Grandpa
Morris...
that
I
wanted
to
get
married...
he
said
Marty
was
great...
but
that
he
was
an
angles
guy.
What
does
that
mean?
That
he
was
a
guy
who
plays
the
angles...
in
business,
love.
He
even
said...
he
might
wind
up
in
jail
someday.
And
I
told
him
he
didn't
understand
Marty...
and
that
even
if
he
ended
up
in
jail
for
life...
I
would
never
regret
marrying
him.
And
I
don't.
We
have
to
help
him
now,
Beth.
Tell
the
judge
who
your
father
is
in
your
life...
who
he's
always
been.
Whatever...
bad
decisions
he's
made.

Okay.
-

Now,
I
read
that
planets
like
they
haven't
been
in
30,000
years.
Uh-huh.
You
didn't
get
the
job
you
were
going
for?
No.
That
why
you
so
down?
-
Hell,
I've
lost
more
jobs
than-
-
Beth
and
I
broke
up.
She
lied.
She
lied,
and
I
found
out
about
it.
I
can't
trust
her
anymore.
Ah.
These
all
seem
fine.
Now,
before
I
went
into
the
service...
I
met
a
girl
who
made
me
a
promise.
When
I
came
back,
But
I
found
out
so
I
put
some
things
in
a
bag
and
I
left.
Never
spoke
to
her
again.
Though
sometimes
the
wanting
to
was
was
like
a
live
animal
Thirty-five
years.
She's
the
only
picture
in
my
head...
can
still
stop
me
in
broad
daylight...
and
make
me
curse
myself

I'm
saying
you
need
to
talk
to
the
girl
No.
I
don't
know.
Liars
is
all
you're
A
man
has
got
to
learn
the
difference
and
liars
worth
lovin'.
Hmm?
Harlan?
If
you
called
that
girl...
couldn't
you
stop
cursing
yourself
even
if
you
still
had
to
be
old?

Adam,
this
is
Rebecca.
Marty
was
sentenced
Of
course
we're
all
very
upset,
but
Beth-
Anyway,
we're
going
home
to
Westchester-
211
Richmond
Road,
Bedford
Hills.
You
have
the
number.
For
months,
all
they
wanted
was

"Do
not
go
about
as
a
talebearer
At
least
I
don't
have
to
pack,
right,
Becky?
We
always
pack
too
much.
This
time,
just
the
toothbrush.

Excuse
me.
Let's
talk
for
a
minute.

Ah,
Bethy.
Bethy.
Your
mother's
gonna
need
your
help.
Yeah,
I
know.

There
are
things
you
do,
and...
you
make
your
choices.
You
live
with
them.
You
and
your
mother
will
never
want
In
two
years
I'll
be
back
home...
and
this
will
all
be
over.
One
more
thing,
about
Adam?
He's
not
for
you.
It's
not
his
fault,
than-
than
anything
else.
He'll
never
be
the
kind
of
man
And
it's
not
fair
that
he
should
hope
that's...
impossible.
People
with
Asperger's
get
married.
-
They
have
families.
He
lives
in
another
world.
You
don't
need
to
make
UmYou
know
this
is
the
best
thing.
You
do
know
that,
Bethany.

It's

It's

##
Uh,
wewe
have
to
talk
again.
You
scared
me.
No,
I
would
never,
ever
do
that.
The
job
was
gone.
They
hired
someone
for
the
job...
but
they
have
another
one
in
an
observatory.
They
said
I
was
just
what
they
needed.
It
starts
in
April,
I
want
you
to
come
with
me.

and,
uh,
you
wouldn't
have
to
teach
anymore.
Hello,
Mr.
Buchwald.
I
came
Oh.
Uh,
I'm-I'm
sorry
you
have
to
go
to
prison.
I
came
to
ask
Beth
to
come
to
California
with
me.
I'd
be
engineering
microchips
I
have
a
job
in
Flintridge,
California.
Uh,
that's
fine.
Congratulations,
Adam.
-
But
Beth
won't
be
able
to
go
with
you.
-
The
family
needs
her.
She's
needed
here.
I-I
can't
go
without
her.
-
Well,
I'm
sorry,
Adam,
but
she
can't
go.
-
You
can't
do
that.
-
You
can't
speak
for
me.
-
You
don't
make
my
decisions!
-
We're
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
st
-
Calm
down.
Calm
down!
Nothing
will
ever
be
the
same!
Nothing!
-
And
I
don't
care
what
you
think!
-
Let
go.
Let
go
of
me.
-
Adam!

Adam!

-
But
you're
coming
to
California?
-
I
mean,
home,
to
the
city!
-
Maybe!
I
don't
know!
I'll
think
about
it!
-
Mom!
I'm
gonna
take
the
car.
Come
back
here!
-

It
didn't
go
well?
What
did
he
say?
He
wouldn't
even
see
me.
I
waited
in
the
visiting
room
for
an
hour.
And
finally
a
guard
came
and
told
me
Your
mother
said
he
wasn't
ready.
I
thought
if
I
actually
went.
I
didn't
think
that
he
wouldn't
even
see
me.
-
What
are
you
gonna
do?
We're
going,
right?
We're
getting
on
a
plane
You
should
pack.
You
haven't
packed
at
all.
Can
you
give
me
a
minute?
Okay?
Just
leave
me
alone
for
a
while.

I'm
not
sure.
Do
you
know
what
you
want?
We'll
never
have
a
moment
and
know
exactly...
what
the
other
person's
feeling.
The
idea
of
that
wouldn't
even
make
sense
to
him.
He's
never
told
me
that
he
loves
me.
I
don't
know
what
it
would
mean
to
him
if
he
did.
Yes.
Feeling
loved
is
very
important...
but...
loving,
my
precious
girl
that's
the
necessity.
Mom,
I
gotta
go.
-
Okay?
I
love
you,
Beth.
Adam?
Why
do
you
want
me
What?
What
do
you
mean?
Why
do
you
want
me
to
go?
Um
You,
um
You
a-are...
like
a
part
of
me.
Um...
and,
um...
I
n
I
need
you...
uh,
to
to,
uh...
help
find
a
place
to
live...
and
to
learn
how
to
get
to
work
and...
to
understand
what
it
means
and,
um...
I
couldn't
go
without
you.
I'm
sorry.
I
can't
go.
If
you
want
me
to
go
because...
you
can't
go
without
me,
I
I
can't
go.

-
You
sure
about
this?
I
have
to
go
alone.
Give
me
that.
Hey,
uh,
I
want
you
to
know...
I
made
that
call.
It,
uh,
took
me
a
while
to
find
her...

-
The
woman's
even
more
stubborn
than
I
am.
I'm
just
trying
to
say
"thank
you,"
damn
it.
Oh.
Oh.
You're
welcome,
Harlan.


Actually,
by
multiple
smaller
telescopes
Uh,
interferometers,
uh,
combine
light
waves...
collected
from
the
same
source.
Um,
a
star,
for
instance,
and
the
as
they
add
together,
or
cancel
out,
It's
what
we
call
constructive
interference,
so
that
the
light
from
two
or
more
telescopes...
can
produce,
um,
uh,
a
brighter
image
Um
But
sometimes
it's
best

Thank
you.
Thank
you
so
much,
Mr.
Raki.
All
right.
We'll
be
heading
out.
Watch
your
step.
Adam.
The
top
one's
for
you.
Um
Oh,
Carol?
Um,
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
with
those?
Yeah.
Thank
you.
-
Hey,
man.
Oh,
you
still
meeting
up
with
everyone
later?
Awesome.

Love,
Beth.
Adam,
his
mother
and
his
father...
were
a
family
of
talking
raccoons...
who
lived
in
Central
Park
They
didn't
really
belong
there,
