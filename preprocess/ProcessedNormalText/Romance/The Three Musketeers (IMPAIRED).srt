ATHOS:
It
is
the
dawn
of
the
17th
century.
After
the
assassination
of
his
father,
the
young
King
Louis
XIII
His
once
peaceful
nation
Within
the
borders
of
France
itself,
plots
in
secret
to
seize
power
for
himself.
The

Louis
find
themselves
without

CAPTAIN:
Move
out!
Halt!

Don't.
Getting
careless?
The
feeling
is
mutual.
For
future
reference,
"I
love
you"

Could
have
just
said,
"Hello."
What
would
be
the
fun
in
that?
-
How
was
the
bishop?
You
are
incorrigible.
I
bet
you
say
that
to
all
the
girls.
But,
sir!
Remember
I
am
a
lady!
Let
me
touch
your
bosom.
Sir,
keep
your
hands
to
yourself!

Hallowed
be
thy
name,
thy
will
be
done,
on

Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread,
and
forgive
us
our
trespasses,
as
we
forgive
those

to

might

you

There's
one
more
piece

No.

me!

Sorry!
I'm
sorry!
Look,
I'm
chasing

a
man
and
tried
to
kill
me,
so
let
me
go!
That's
not
good
enough.
I'm
in

hurry.

Majesty

So,
madam,
what
of
Buckingham?
Majesty?
Well,
what's
he
wearing
these
days?
Green,
Your
Majesty.
-
Green?
LOUIS
XIII:
Very
interesting.
And
you
had
the
gall
to
recommend
blue?
Of
course
it
should
be
green.
Why
am
I
surrounded
Green,
green,
green!
Do
I
have
to
do
everything
myself?

D'ARTAGNAN:
Ah!
There
you
are.
Shall
we
get
to
it?
ATHOS:
So,
are
you
eager
I
have
other
appointments.
You'll
miss
them,
I'm
afraid.
Well,
I'll
try
my
best
to
be

You're

this
rascal?
My
appointments.

2:00.
How
long
have
you
been
in
Paris?
-
Arrived
this
morning.
Patience
is
not
one
of
my
virtues.
Well,
neither
are
good
manners.
Wait
for
your
turn,
old
man.

What
would
you
like
me
to
put
D'Artagnan.
I'm
Athos.
This
is
Porthos
and
Aramis.
The
Three
Musketeers.
I've
heard
of
you.
From
my
father,
a
Musketeer
himself.
In
fact,
I
came
to
Paris
to
be
one
of
you.
I'm
afraid
you're
a
little
late.
What
happened?
Oh,
a
bad
mission.
Budget
cuts.
Cardinal,
progress.
Take
your
pick.

Well,
then,
welcome
to
Paris.
Pity
we'll
have
to
kill
you.
Well,
if
I
can't
become
a
Musketeer,
Or
three.

Kill
him
already.
Halt!

Jussac.
Well,
well,
well.
Dueling
in
defiance
of
the
edicts?
You
got
tired
of
rolling
peddlers
-
Now...
JUSSAC:
Surrender
your
weapons
GUARD:
Seal
it
off!
Unless,
of
course,
you
would
rather
resist.
PORTHOS:
New
plan.
Kill
the
boy,
kick
their
asses,
I
could
do
with
some
exercise.
GUARD:
Seal
it
off,
boys!
You
were
saying?
On
the
other
hand,
You're
the
Musketeers.
Wrong.
We
were
the
Musketeers.
ATHOS:
Rochefort.



ARAMIS:
Shall
we?
Finish
them
off.
Let's
even
the
odds.
Enjoying
the
show?
-
JUSSAC:
You!
D'ARTAGNAN:
You
didn't
Are
you
always
this
cocky?
Only
on
Tuesdays
and
whenever
beautiful
women
are
involved.
Damn
you!
Can't
you
see

What
is
your
name?
Constance.
Constance.
Sounds
very
steadfast.
A
quality
you
seem
to
know
little
about.
-
Oh,
I
beg
to
differ.
Deep
down,
I
am
a
hopeless
romantic.
Back
for
more?


I'd
forgotten
what
it
feels
like.
We
all
have.
The
name
is
D'Artagnan.
You
must
come
from
a
very
small
town.
How
did
you
know?
CONSTANCE:
Lines
like
yours
This
is
Paris.
In
the
battle
of
wits,


She's
right,
lad.
The
ladies
of
Paris
They
have
1,000
ways
of
saying,
"No,"
I
hate
to
ruin
the
mood,
And
unless
you
wish
to
Elsewhere.
D'ARTAGNAN:
So,
now
what?
ATHOS:
I
think
there's
been
enough
fighting
PORTHOS:
Besides,
any
man
who's
an
enemy
D'ARTAGNAN:
Who's
Rochefort?
ARAMIS:
Captain
of
the
Cardinal's
guards.
The
right
hand
of
the
most
powerful
man
Rochefort
is
the
most
feared
swordsman
You
certainly
know
how
to
pick
your
fights.
Like
I
said,
he
insulted
my
horse.
PORTHOS:
You're
reckless,
probably
be
dead
by
sundown,
-
Where
are
you
staying?
Ah!
Do
you
have
any
money?
Well,
good
sir,
you
and
your
fine
steed
For
the
time
being.
That
goes
in
there.

Come
on.
What
shall
we
drink
to?
How
about
the
King?
He's
a
child.
Cardinal

To

Friendship?
Love?

you
still
believe
in.
This.
And
this.
Anyone
who
tells
you
otherwise

Deep
down...
What

You
know,
I
don't
want
to
offend
anybody,
but
I
thought
you'd
all
be

What
my
esteemed
colleague
is
that
we
are
obsolete.
We're
warriors,
And
so
we
drink
and
brawl
and
then
we
drink
some
more.
What
we
need
is
a
great
cause.
But
there
are
no
great
causes
left.
Which
is
why
I
keep
telling
you
it's
not

for
the
city.
Free
booze
at
wakes
and
weddings.
You
were

I
realized

man
of
God
and
a
man
of
the
cloth
PORTHOS:
And
yet,
he
still
says
prayers
-
Old
habit.
The
men
I
kill
deserve
to
die.
But
they
also
deserve
peace.
After
all,
they
must
have
believed
We
all
do.
Even
the
worst
of
us.
I'll
drink
to
that!
Planchet!
More
wine!
Planchet!
Sorry,
sirs.
I'm
afraid
there's
none
left.
You've
drunk
the
lot.
PORTHOS:
What
sort
of
answer's
that?
Well,
go
get
some
more,
man!
Very
good,
sir.
It's
just,
I
can't,
sir.
We've

PORTHOS:
Planchet,

In

D'ARTAGNAN:

Oh!

Thank
you
very
much,
sir!
That's
incredibly
generous
Thank
you
very,
very
much.
Will
you
be
staying
here
tonight?
ARAMIS:
He'll
be
taking
your
bed,
Planchet.
Right,
and
so
I'll
be
sleeping...
You
may
take
the
balcony.
Outside?
The
balcony
outside
in
the
cold?
With
birds
shitting
on
my
head
all
night?
Great,
can
I
just
say
you...
Wine!
Wine!
-
ALL:
Wine!
Wine!
Wine!
Wine!



RICHELIEU:
Check.

This
is
a
ridiculous
game.
Surely
the
King
The
King
is
the
most
important
piece.
But
he's
vulnerable,
he
needs
protection.
May
I
suggest
you
castle
him?
Checkmate.
There.
What
do
you
think
of
that?
Your
Majesty
is
a
force
of
nature.
-
Took
you
by
surprise,
eh?
May
we
speak
a
little
about
foreign
policy?
-
It's
not
about
Buckingham,
is
it?
He's
arriving
in
Paris
tomorrow.
His
master,
King
James,
has
agreed
Good,
good.
Well,
he
knows
better
There's
also
another
matter.
A
dangerous
rivalry
has
sprung
between
Your
Majesty's
Musketeers
Who
was
involved?
Athos,
Porthos,
Aramis.
The
usual
suspects.
And
a
young
man
called
D'Artagnan.
I
have
summoned
them
to
the
palace
so
that
His
Majesty,
the
King!
Well,
well,
well.

Brawling
with
the
Cardinal's
guards.
That's
very
bad.
What
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourselves?
-
We...
LOUIS
XIII:
Yes.
So,
tell
me,
how
many
There
were
four
of
us
against
40
of
them,
Four
against
40?
-
And
you
beat
them
like
a
drum?
And,
yes,
you
shall
have
to
be
reprimanded,
most
harshly,
I'm
afraid.
-
You
do
understand
that,
don't
you?
CASTELLAN:
Her
Majesty,
the
Queen.
LOUIS
XIII:
Anne.
What
a...
What
a
pleasant
surprise!
My
ladies
and
I
wanted
to
see
who
stood
against
the
Cardinal's
guards.
Four
against
40?
Or
was
it
400?
ATHOS:
Just
40,
Your
Majesty.
Lt
was
an
off
day.

That's
my
Musketeers
for
you.
By
the
time
they
write
songs
about
them,
I
hope
you
won't
be
too
harsh
with
them.
After
all,
boys
will
be
boys.
You
must
be
D'Artagnan.
My
lady
in
waiting
has
told
me
about
But
you
must
try
not
to
be
so
reckless.
Can't
help
myself,
Your
Majesty.
-
Your
Majesty,
the
culprits.
Well,
stand
up,
then.
Athos.
Porthos.
Aramis.
Forgive
me
for
saying
this,
D'Artagnan,
My
father
is
a
poor
man,
Your
Majesty.
A
former
Musketeer
as
well.
These
are
the
only
clothes
I
have.
LOUIS
XIII:
Oh,
Lord.
Can't
have
my
Musketeers,
New
suits
all
around,
I
think.
Yes.
You'll
see
to
that,
Cardinal?
And,
yes,

Or
there'll
be
none

Your
Majesty,

Forgive
my
impudence,
Cardinal,

doubt

After
all,

Good
day,
gentlemen.

XIII:
Well,
now,
But

there
for

RICHELIEU:
I
tire
of
these
royal
children.
Lt's

make
our
move.
We
shall
use
Buckingham's
arrival
During
his

we
will
reveal
that

arranged
a

CAPTAIN:
About
face!
Well,
where
is
he,
then?

MAN:
Drop
anchor!
Anchor
aweigh!
Damn
his
impudence!
What
is
that
thing
called
An
airship,
Your
Majesty.
-
Why
don't
I
have
one
of
those?
Right,
right.
Well,
build
me
one.
MAN:
Secure
the
lines!
All
lines
secured!
Buckingham.
Blue.
Oh.
Your
Majesty.
Love
the
outfit.
Very
retro.
We
were
all
wearing
those
in
London,
when
was
it,
last
year
or
the
year
before?
Lord
Buckingham,
I
trust
your
journey
Not
at
all.
No.
On
the
contrary.

a

and
keeps

Of
course,
being
a
servant
of
God,

King
James
is
most
eager

Lord
Buckingham.
Your
Majesty.
I
must
say
your
beauty
is
far
more
radiant
You've
met
before?
A
long
time
ago.
An
evening
I
shall
cherish
forever.
Right.
Well,
shall
we?
Now
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise.
Another
acquaintance
of
yours,
I
see.
We've
met,
yes.
As
I
recall,
last
I
saw
you,
Most
unfortunate
habit.
Lt's
a
habit
I
shall
have
to
break
I
look
forward
to
it.
In
the
meantime,
shall
we
talk
peace?

You
must
pass
me

Wine?
I
don't

What
about

rather
nice
bottle
of
You
must
pass
me

And
yours

mine.
England
cannot
afford
a
war
on
two
fronts.
Both
our
nations
A
peace
treaty
would
be
Whose
advantage?
Yours?
Ours.
I
have
a
feeling
my
new

machines
Very
impressive.
CAPTAIN:
And
march!
Hold
your
line!
Halt!
About
face!
GUARD:
Stay
where
you
are!
This
is
the
Queen's
wing.
Oh,
thank
goodness.
I
got
so
lost.
I
took
a
wrong
turn
I've
been
trapped
up
here,
in
the
sun,
-
It's
going
to
be
all
right.
-
You're
in
safe
hands.
CAPTAIN:
And
march!
Halt!
You
can't
shoot.
They'll
hear
you.
Shh!
CAPTAIN:
Wait
for
it!

Left,
left!
D'ARTAGNAN:
Constance!
Constance!
Pardon,
Your
Majesty.
This
will
only
take
a
moment.
What
are
you
doing
here?
His
Majesty
wants
a
word
with
me.
Yes,
lovely.
Now,
excuse
me.
I
was...
I
was
thinking,
after
I'm
finished
I
can't.
I
have
plans.
D'ARTAGNAN:
What
about
tomorrow?
I
have
a
lot
of
plans.
-
Well,
I...
You
may
have
a
new
set
of
clothes
but
you
still
act
like
Now
excuse
me.

CAPTAIN:
And
halt!
About

And
march!
Left!
Left,
right,

D'ARTAGNAN:
Two
summons
in
two
days.
LOUIS
XIII:
Cut
it
out.
You're
a
good
fellow,
D'Artagnan.
So,
how
are
the
ladies
-
Can't
complain.
Well,
same
here,
of
course.
Thing
is...
I've
got
this
friend.
Just
a
regular
chap,
like
you
and
me.
He
got
married
very
young.
Political
alliance,
arranged
marriage,
Hardly
knew
the
girl.
-
But
he
likes
her?
Mmm-hmm.
Very
much.
Well,
does
she
like
him?
Well,
funny
you
should
say
that.
He's...
He's
not
sure.

Well,
he
just
feels
like
a
fool
He's
always
saying
the
wrong
thing.
His
heart's
pumping
so
loud
Lt's
torture
just
to
look
at
her.
-
Have
you
ever
felt
this
way?
So,
what
do
we
do?
He
should
speak
his
heart.
Be
someone
who
cares
for
her
Be
himself.
Well,
that's
what
I
told
him.
Well,
then
he's
doubly
lucky.
After
all,
he
does
have
Yes.
Yes.
lt's
good
to
have
friends.
Will
you
excuse
me
just
for
one
moment?
I
don't
believe
it.

How
are
you?
Very
well.
I'm
wearing
blue.
And
you
look
very
handsome
in
it.

Thank
you.
Yes,
I...
In
fact,
I
was
only
just
remarking
How
beautiful
you
are.
Thank
you,
My
Lord.

RICHELIEU:
How
did
it
go?
RICHELIEU:
Good.
You'll
go
back
to
London
MILADY:
And
what
should
I
do
with
them?
Put
them
in
his
personal
vault,
-
The
Tower
of
London.
When
the
scandal
breaks,
But

He
would
have
led
England
to
war
And
what
of
the
future
of
France?
I
am
France.
One
last
thing.
I
suppose
it's
quite
easy,
for
a
double
agent
to
play
both
sides.
Have
I
given
Your
Eminence
Spare
me
the
rhetoric.
I
know
who
you
are.
I
know
what
you
are.
You
have
a
gift
for
corruption
I
admire
such
skills.
But
I'll
destroy
you
the
moment
I
suspect
you
might
be
using
them
against
me.
Do
we
understand
one
another?
There
is
another
side
to
that
coin.
Lt's
quite
easy
for
an

the

that
they
are

in

or
on
the
gallows.

point

I
require
a

An
insurance
policy,
if
you
will.

My
word
should
suffice.
I'm
afraid
I'll
need
something
a
bit
more
substantial.

Oh,
well.
Do
give
my

to
the

I
will
convey
your
diplomatic
proposal
Cardinal
Richelieu,
a
pleasure.
All
mine.
Your

Richelieu!
There

been
Certain

letters,
were
discovered
Letters
from
him.
Buckingham,
of
course!
Who
else?
Have
you
spoken
to
the
Queen
No.
Of
course
I
haven't.
Hmm.
I
can
see
Your
Majesty's
dilemma.
Is
there
any
mention
-
A
token
of
affection,
perhaps?
Yes,
there
is.
A
necklace.
The
one
I
gave
her
"I
shall
always
cherish
"the
proof
of
our
consummated
love."
Does
"consummated"
mean
Yes,
I'm
afraid
it
does.
Oh,
my
God!
All
Your
Majesty
has
to
do
is
throw
a
ball.
What?
How
would
that
help?
Lt
would
give
Your
Majesty
the
pretext
that
she
wear
your
gift.
Oh,
Richelieu,
that's
very
clever.
So,
if
she
has
the
diamonds...
Your
Majesty
can
rest
easy.
And
if
she
doesn't?
He
wants
to
have
a
celebration
ball,
Send
my
diamonds
to
the
jeweler's
I
want
the
King's
undivided
attention
I
hope
I
am
not
interrupting.
Hardly,
Your
Majesty.
To
what
do
I
owe...
I
know.
Perhaps
Your
Majesty
I
know.
Yeah.
I
assume
this
is
the
part
and
regale
Your
Majesty
with
the
details
However,
I
regret
to
inform
Your
Majesty
that
I
have
no
idea
of
I
thought
you'd
say
that.
Then
why
did
you
grace
me
To
look
into
your
eyes
when
you
said
it.
-
Your
Majesty.
All
may
not
be
lost
yet.

PLANCHET:
Coming,
coming!
Lt's
not
a

Actually,
it
is.
You
want
me
to
go
to
England,
retrieve
the
diamonds,
might
be
in
Buckingham's
possession,
which
will
naturally
involve
breaking
into
highly
impregnable
facility?
The
Tower
of
London.
Since
the
Cardinal's
spies
it
is
the
most
logical
choice.
Then
return
to

on
both
sides
of
the

Did
I
miss
anything?
All
in
five
days.
A

detail.
Anything
else?
No.
Well,
I
really
only
have
Why
in
the
world
would
I
do
that?
England
it
is.
D'ARTAGNAN:
Diamonds,
Buckingham,
Queen's
reputation
Who's
with
me?
Well,
I
should
imagine
Count
Porthos.
Hmm?
What
do
you
think?
Besides,
I
hear
the
English
women
are
a
Ice
on
the
outside,
This
isn't
a
great
cause,
Buckingham's
there,
so
is
she.
Who?
Countess
de
Winter.
Charlotte
Backson.
Anne
de
Breuil.
Lady
Clarick.
Milady.
Milady?
I
know
her.
I
saw
her
with
Rochefort.
PORTHOS:
She's
switched
sides
again.
She's
working
for
the
Cardinal,
no
doubt.
What
are
you
going
to
do
if
you
catch
her?
ROCHEFORT:
Musketeers,
open
up
-
You
were
followed.
Athos,
Porthos,
Aramis
and
D'Artagnan,
surrender
your
weapons
The
moment
they
step
out,
kill
them.
Light
the
torches!
I'll
count
to
five,
then
One!
Two!
Three!
Oh!
Sorry!
Didn't
see
you
there.
-
JUSSAC:
Damn
you!
JUSSAC:
Fire!
RICHELIEU:
Let
me
guess.
You've
come
to
tell
me
our
plan
is
proceeding
on
schedule,
and
I
have
absolutely,
positively,
We
were
taken
by
surprise,
Your
Eminence.
Somehow
I
was
laboring
that
the
plan
was
for
you
-
Was
it
not?
Yes,
you
are
quite
fond
of
that
word,
Sadly,
repeating
it
Alert
Milady.
Watch
the
ports.
No
one
is
to
leave
for
England
Post
a
bounty
on
their
heads.
The
bigger,
the
better.
Yes,
Your
Eminence.
Rochefort.
Do
not
fail
me
again.
ARAMIS:
Jussac
and
a
lot
of
help.
How
the
hell
did
he
get
here
so
fast?
D'ARTAGNAN:
Now
what?
-
I'll
go.
I
could
go.
Probably
not.
Wrong.
Wrong
on
all
counts.
I
can't
help
you
there,
but
I
can
help.
Right
here,
right
now.
-
If
they
catch
you...
-
If
they
catch
you...
You,
on
the
other
hand,
and
about
to
steal
Which
one
of
us
should
be
worried?
Go.
Go
so
that
you
can
come
back.
Now
give
me
that
hat.
D'Artagnan!
Get
after
him!
Wait!
ATHOS:
The
diamonds
will
be
located
in
the
lowest,
most
secure
level
The
lock
is
state
of
the
art.
Lt
requires
a
key
that
Buckingham
Corridor
leading
up
to
it
is
booby-trapped.
Oh,
I'm
glad
that's
straightforward.
Tempt
anyone
You
hadn't
finished
the
briefing,
actually.
Please
don't
tell
me
off.
ATHOS:
Then
it
gets
worse,
a
lot
worse.
We
have
to
cross
three
stone
walls
And
there's
just
a
couple
of
hundred
with
a
predilection
for
not
being
robbed.
Although,
since
Buckingham
undoubtedly
that
number
is
likely
to
be
greater.
D'ARTAGNAN:
And
why
can't
we
just
tell
ATHOS:
Because
he
wouldn't
believe
us.
Besides,
Milady
would
have
made
sure.
Athos
is
coming.
Tell
me.
What
do
you
suppose
he's
after?
What
does
it
matter?
Whatever
it
is,
it's
merely
an
excuse.
He
wants
me.
And
he
wants
you.
We
shall
have
to
be
ready
for
him.
Won't
we?
We
can't
outshoot
them,
He'll
naturally
favor
He
knows
we're
expecting
him,
She
knows
us.
What
we
look
like,
how
we
move,
He'll
divide
his
forces,
independent
teams,
each
with
their
own
point
of
entry
There
are
four
of
us.
So
we
use...
Well,
there's
five

Check

every

on
the
other
hand,
One
of
his
preferred
methods
All
the
more
reason
One
more
thing.
They
may
try
and
drive
a
wedge
between
us.
Claim
to
have
secret
information
about
some
plot
to
get
us
like,
say,
I'm
a
double
agent
or
you're
looking
to
get
rid
of
me.
I
assure
you,
-

I
suppose
I
should
search
you
for
concealed
weapons.
That's
how
it's
done.
And
that's
exactly
what
she'll
expect.
So
we
do
the
unexpected.
We
go
in
broad
daylight.
With
all
the
extra
security,
there'll
be
And
you,
D'Artagnan,
you're
the
wild
card.
We
are
the
decoys.
Now
we'll
try
and
create
a
distraction,
keep
them
away
from
you
but,
ultimately,
it's
down
to
you.
You
wanted
to
be
a
Musketeer?
You
want
to
serve
France?
This
is
your
chance.
COMMANDER:
Left,
right,
left,
right,
left!
I
thought
you
saw
the
signal!
-
I
saw
you
waving
like
an
idiot!
I'm
trying
to
see
things
but,
unfortunately,
-
Up
your
ass?
I'll
tell
you
what...
SERGEANT:
That's
enough
of
that!
PORTHOS:
Finally,
good,
Now
listen,
Sergeant,
Arrest
me?
You
can't
arrest
me!
Don't
you
tell
me
that!
-
Bantams?
They
are
rotten!
Sir!
The
first
of
the
Musketeers
The
game
is
afoot.
Bring
him
to
me
and
double
the
guards.
Double
everything.
Sir!
They'll
come
to
us.
Well,
then.
I
think
Your
Lordship
You
won't
mind
if
I
don't
stay
-
Do
you
think
I
might
lose?
I
have
no
issues
with
you
killing
Athos,
but,
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you,
Tell
me,
what's
your
favorite
color?
Red.
Why?
I
wanted
to
see
Hmm.
As
far
from
here
as
possible.
Well,
well,
well.
Look
at
what
the
cat
dragged
in.
So,
how's
the
old
Athos,
eh?
Still
his
surly,
Sending
a
boy
to
do
a
man's
job.
I
should
feel
insulted.
Well,
what
were
you
after
anyway,
eh?
Secrets,
spies,
it's
all
a
game,
really.
Although
the
price
of
loss,
is
a
little
bit
higher.
What?
No
last
words?
No
insults?
-
Pleas
for
mercy
or...
About
2:00,
I'd
say.
Look
out
of
the
window.
They
weren't
the
decoys.
I
was.
Ahhh!


Permission
to
come
aboard?
Granted.



Athos!
The
wonderful
thing
about
fighting
is
that
he's
always
greatly
skilled
Eminence.
The
pride
of
victory
I
trust
you
didn't
come
here
to
impress
me
No,
Your
Eminence.
I
have
some
good
news.
Such
as?
So
what
about
the
diamonds?
Nope.
Milady
likes
hedging
her
bets.
She'd
never
have
taken
the
chance
we'd
actually
succeed
D'ARTAGNAN:
So
where
are
they
now?
ATHOS:
With
the
only
person
she
trusts.
Which
means
we've
lost
her
I
wouldn't
say
that.
You
were
the
decoy,
we
were
the
extraction,
but
the
real
linchpin
of
the
plan,
well,
that
was
someone
else
entirely.
Someone
even
Milady
would
never
suspect.
Driver!
What
the
hell
is
going
on?
Just
following
your
instructions,
ma'am.

PLANCHET:
Whoo-hoo!
Planchet.
Never
thought
well
done.
Thank
you,
sir.
That
means
a
lot,
Shut
up,
Planchet.
Yes,
sir.
-
Don't.
We
took
the
precaution
What
now?
You
give
me
the
diamonds
Dealer's
choice.
-
Anything
else
you'd
like
me
to
take
off?
Boys.
Been
a
while.
This
must
be
the
young
Gascon.
We've
met
before.
Ah,
yes.
Small
world.
I
didn't
let
Rochefort
kill
you.
You
do
remember
that,
don't
you?

-
Did
you
kill
Buckingham?
-
But
you
will
kill
me?
You
would
spare
him,
but
kill
me?
Yes.
I
don't
hate
Buckingham.
Here.
You
may
find
use
for
this.
Move.
Athos.
At
least
she
died
the
way
she
lived,
She
did
it
for
me.
I
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
live
Come
on,
let's
go
home.
LADY:
But
I
can't
get
it.
LADY
2:
How
marvelous!
Oh!
So
great!
-

Your
Majesty.
My
dear.
You
look
troubled.
Hardly.
Your
Majesty
just
startled
me.
Oh,
I'm
so
sorry.
I
just
wanted
to
drop
by
and
tell
you
how
much
Should
be
quite
spectacular,
you
know.
But
you,
you
shall
be
And
especially
since
You
will
wear
them,
won't
you?
Well,
it's
very
important
Then
I
shall
wear
them,
Your
Majesty.
Until
tonight,
then.
She
promised
she'll
wear
them.
You
do
think
she'll
wear
them,
I'm
sure
she
will,
Your
Majesty.
I'm
sure
she
will.

I
hate
air
travel!

Damn!
HELMSMAN:
Hard
to
starboard!
Well,
now
that
we
have
their
attention,
let's
see
if
we
can
settle
this
More
or
less.
Ah,
Gascon!
So
you've
traded
up
But,
once
again,
you're
outmatched.
You
can
thank
Milady
for
that.
She
passed
on
Buckingham's
plans
As
you
can
see,

Isn't
she
a
beauty?
What
do
you
want?
The
diamonds.
-
Come
and
take
them.
You
see,
I
can
blast
you
out
of
the
sky
If
you
fire
on
me,
on
the
other
hand,
you'll
be
killing
You
have
60
seconds.
He'll
shoot
us
down
We
can't
outrun
them.
And
we
can't
fight
them,
damn
it!
We
can't.
-
Oh,
D'Artagnan.
Do
you
think
What
if
she
dies?
The
life
of
one
woman
what
would
you
do
ATHOS:
I've
made
a
lot
of
sacrifices,
For
honor,
for
King,
for
country.
Hard
choices
and
sacrifices
Life
is
too
damn
short
and
too
damn
long
Don't
end
up
like
me.
Choose
the
woman.
France
will
take
care
of
itself.
ROCHEFORT:
Time's
up!
An
exchange.
I
go
aboard
your
ship
with
the
diamonds,
Once
I
know
she's
safe,
I
give
them
to
you.
Fine.
But
I
want
to
see
the
diamonds
first.
Planchet.
Cut
her
loose.
JUSSAC:
Deploy
the
gangway!
Satisfied?
You
never
learn,
do
you?
Fire!
Hard
right!
Fire!
Good.
I
really
want
you
to
see
this.
Finish
them
off!
We
can't
outrun
them
We
could
try
asking
them
to
surrender,
We
hide.
In
there.

HELMSMAN:
Fire!
GUNNER:
Fire!
Lay
in
a
pursuit
course!
HELMSMAN:
Lay
in
a
pursuit
course!
GUNNER:
Fire!
He's
persistent,
I'll
give
him
that!
GUNNER:
Fire!
But,
sir!
We
can't
go
into
the
storm!
ROCHEFORT:
Anyone?
Anyone
else
who
wants
to
question
orders?
Good.

Sir,
now
might
be
a
good
time
Shut
up,
Planchet.
Yes,
sir.
Where
are
they?
You're
never
gonna
find
them
in
there.
I
beg
to
differ.
Keep
after
them!
I'll
take
the
Gascon!
CREWMAN:
Hard
to
starboard!
You
know
what
your
problem
is,
boy?
You
read
too
many
books,
Courage,
honor.
All
for
one.
But
history
isn't
written
by
heroes,
Keep
your
eyes
open!
Round
two.
Oh...

CREWMAN:
Return
fire!
Pull
up,
damn
it!
We're
too
heavy!
You
scared
to
take
me
in
a
fair
fight?
Hardly.
I
just
don't
fight
fair.
Captain
Rochefort!
Oh,
well.

Drop
the
ballast!
Drop
everything!
And
fire
up
the
burners!
Over
the
side!
Drop
those
barrels!
Faster!
Move!
Shall
we?
Hold
on!
Get
out
of
the
way!
Go!
Run!




I
still
have
the
diamonds.
Kill
you.
If
you
insist.

Oh!




You
should've
stayed
in
Gascony,
boy.
You
should've
apologized
to
my
horse.

RICHELIEU:
Surround
the
palace!
Use
every
man
at
your
disposal!
-
Your
Eminence!
These
men
must
not...


Arrest
these
men!
What
is
the
meaning
of
this?
Your
Majesty,
these
men...
Are
delivering
a
gift
for
Your
Majesty.
Cardinal,
you
shouldn't
have.
Well,
Your
Majesty
did
ask
me
So
I
did.
But
what
happened
to
it?
Buckingham's
spy,
Rochefort,
-
He's
been
dealt
with.
He's
Captain
of
your
guards,
isn't
he?
Actually,
His
Eminence
was
the
one
"lt
is
by
my
order
"that
the
bearer
of
this
-
That's
your
signature,
isn't
it,
Richelieu?
LOUIS
XIII:
Well,
let
me
get
this
right.
You
brought
me
an
airship
How
can
I
ever
repay
you?
I
could
think
of
a
few
ways.
Anne.
I
was
just
returning
from
the
jewelers.
Well,
I
realize
it's
a
little
early,
but
the
orchestra's
here
and
so
are
we.
Would
Your
Majesty
care
to
dance?
I
would
love
to.
Well,
mind
out,
you
fellows!
D'Artagnan.
Well,
well,
well.
Looks
like
you
aren't
the
only
one
Your
Majesty
is
a
natural.
Guess
I
am.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
think
you'll
start
noticing
Thank
you.
For
everything.
Any
time.
LOUIS
XIII:
Well,
strike
up,
then!
CONDUCTOR:
Your
Majesty!
Positions,
please,
gentlemen!

Well-played.

I
could
use
men
like
you.
I
already
have
a
job.
-
I'm
a
drunk.
Thanks,
but
no.
The
day
will
come
D'ARTAGNAN:
Maybe.
But
not
today.
Maybe
not
today.
Enjoying
the
show?
Are
you
always
this
cocky?
Only
on
Tuesdays
and
whenever
beautiful
women
are
involved.
So
you
think
I'm
beautiful.
Actually,
it's
Tuesday.

ARAMIS:
So,
what
now?
PORTHOS:
And
then
what?
Wherever
they
send
us.
I
thought
you
didn't
believe
I
believe
in
us.
Till
the
day
I
stop
believing
that,
there
are
still
things
in
this
world
All
for
one!
ALL:
And
one
for
all!
You
know,
sirs,
I
know
you
can
be
mean,
tough,
but
sometimes
I
get
the
feeling
ALL:
Shut
up,
Planchet!
Yeah,
yeah,
of
course.

In
case
you're
wondering,
I'm
not
dead,
and
neither
are
you.
What?
How
did
you...
Followed
Athos.
We
fished
you
out
of
the
Channel.
-
Where
are
we
going?
SEAMAN:
Sail
away!
To
get
back
what's
mine

Roll
ballast!
