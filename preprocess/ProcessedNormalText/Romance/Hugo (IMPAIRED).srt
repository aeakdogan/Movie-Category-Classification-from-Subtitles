Good
morning.

Good
morning.
New
delivery.
I'm
sure
you've



Got
you
at
last!
Not
the
first
time
you've
stolen
-
Hm?
Quick,
empty
your
pockets.
Empty
your
pockets,
Do
as
I
say!
Ooh,
ooh,
ooh,
ooh.

What
are
you
doing
with
all
these?
-
And
the
other
one.
Where's
the
Station
Inspector?!

Ghosts.
Did
you
draw
these
pictures?
Did
you
draw
these
pictures?
Where
did
you
steal
this?
-
I
didn't
steal
it.
-
Get
out
of
here.
It's
no
longer
your
notebook!
It
is
my
notebook
and
I'll
do
with
it
-
No!
Get
out
of
here,
you
little
thief!

Why
are
you
still
here?
-
Go!

Calamity?
Corruption?
Go!

Excuse
me,
excuse
me!


Move
aside!
Gangway!
Move,
move!

Stand
aside!



What?!


Move,
move!
Ah!

As
you
were.
Move!

Stop
that
child!
Apprehend!
Monsieur
Frick!
Hey!
Move
aside!
Whoa!
-
Move!
-
Move!
-
Pardon
me!
-
Sir,
move!


Malediction!
Oh!
No!
Stop
the
train!
Hold
the
train!
Whoa!
Help!
Help!
Assistance!
Oh!
Hold
it,
hold
the
train!
Move
the
bag!
Move
the
bag!
Ohhh!
Oh!
No!








I'm
so
sorry.
No,
no,
no.



I
know
you're
there.
What's
your
name,
boy'?
Hugo.
Hugo
Cabret.
Stay
away
from
me,
Hugo
Cabret.
Or
I'll
drag
you
He'll
lock
you
up
in
his
little
cell,
and
you'll
never
get
out,
you
will
never
get
married
to
take
things
Give
me
back
my
notebook.
I'm
going
home
to
burn
your
notebook.
-
You
can't
burn
my
notebook.



Oh,
you
look
so
cold.

I'm
very
hot.
-
Who's
really
upset
you?


Who
are
you?
Your
grandfather
stole
my
notebook.
I've
got
to
get
it
back
Papa
Georges
isn't
my
grandfather.
And
he
isn't
a
thief.
You're
nothing
but
a...
a
reprobate.
-
You'll
have
to
go.
Why
do
you
need
it
so
badly'?
I
can't
tell
you.
Is
it
a
secret?
-
Yes.
-
Tell
me
this
instant.
Well,
if
you
won't
tell
me,
-
Not
without
my
notebook!
I'll
get
in
trouble.
Just
go
home.

All
right.
I'll
make
sure
he
doesn't
Now
go.


What
is
it?

It's
called
an
automaton.
An
aut...
An
automaton?
I
found
him
abandoned
What
does
he
do?

He's
a
windup
figure,
This
is
the
most
complicated
one
You
see,
this
one...
this
one
can
write.
It
must've
been
made
in
London.
Where
Mother
was
from.
She
was
from
Coventry,
but
she...
Magicians
used
machines
like
this
Some
walked,
some
danced,
But
the
secret
was
always
Huh,
look
at
that.
Can
we
fix
him?
Oh,
I
don't
know,
Hugo.
He's
badly
rusted.
And
finding
parts
to
fit
Of
course
we
can
fix
him.
We're
clockmakers,
aren't
we?
But
only
after
I've
finished
and
at
the
museum,
hmm?
We'll
put
this
back
in.
Perfect.

You
see
this?
Another
mystery.
That
makes
you
happy.
Mmm.
A
keyhole
Unfortunately,
we
don't
have
the
key.






I
fixed
the
gears
and...
Uncle
Claude.

There
was
a
fire.
Your
father's
dead.

Pack
your
things,
quickly.

-
Quick!

You'll
be
my
apprentice,
And
I'll
teach
you
how

These
apartments
were
built
for
them
But
every
body's
forgotten
they're
here.
Your
bed
is
in
the
corner,
over
there.

Now
get
some
sleep.
Oh...
-
What
about
school?
There'll
be
no
time
for
that
Hugo,
without
me,



Ah,
time...
-
My
time
is...
60
seconds
in
a
minute.
Sixty
minutes
in
an
hour.
Time
is
everything.
Everything.

Ah,



OK.

Oh,
hello.
-
I
just
thought...

-
...rather
nice
joke.
-
Ah,
ah,
ah!
Oh,
oh!
Stop
that!

Oh!

Come
back!
Stand
back!

Please
be
careful!

Don't
hurt
him!




Good
morning!

Hello,
how
are
you?
Good
morning,
sir.
I'll
take
these.



I
thought
I
might
see
you
today.
I
need
my
notebook.
Why
do
you
need
it
so
badly'?
To
help
me...
to
fix
something.
Go
away.
Please
just
go
away.

Wait!
Hey!
-
Sorry,
I...
-
Are
you
crying?
Hold
still.
Look,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
crying.
Sydney
Carton
cries.
-
In
books,
they're
crying
all
the
time.
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
But
not
here.
We're
too...
exposed.
-
Come
on.
Only
to
the
most
wonderful
It's
Neverland
and
Oz
and...

Ah,
Isabelle.
May
I
present
to
you
a
very
old
and
dear
companion.
Monsieur
Cabret.
Hello.
Well,
thank
you
for
this.
I
think
I'm
halfway
in
love
with
-
Back
corner,
left,
top
shelf.

Listen,
what's
so
important?
Papa
Georges
still
has
your
notebook.
He
didn't
burn
it.
-
Why?
All
I
know
is
the
notebook
And
he
and
Mama
Jeanne
stayed
up
Well,
you
see,
I
think
he
was
crying.
Why
are
you
helping
me?
Because
this
might
be
an
adventure.
And
I've
never
had
one
before...
outside
of
books,
at
least.
And
I
think
we
should
be
very...
clandestine.
OK.
By
the
way,
my
name's
Isabelle.
Monsieur
Labisse
lets
me
borrow
them,
No.
Don't
you
like
books?
No...
No,
I
do.
My
father
and
I
used
to
read

Well,
come
on.

How
do
I
get
my
notebook
back?

Well,
I
think
you
And
don't
tell
him
we
talked.
I'll
help
you
if
I
can.
Be
steadfast.

Go
away.
Fix
it.
I
said,
fix
it.
I
know
you've
been
You
might
as
well
use
those


Give
me
my
notebook.
You've
got
a
bit
of
talent.
But
you'll
have
to
prove
there's
-
You
can
earn
your
notebook.
Come
to
the
booth
every
day.
I'll
decide
how
long
you
must
And
it
will
be
up
to
me
you've
earned
-
I
already
have
a
job.
I
have
a
different
job.
You
begin
tomorrow.
Go
away.
I'll
begin
now.
Not
that
one,
the
other
one.





Is
this
your
card?




Where
is
it?

-
Little
man.


-
Ah!

Where
are
your
designated
adults?
-
Ain't
got
none.

-
No!
It's
straight
to
the
orphanage
What
were
you
doing
Was
that
your...

as
that
your
paper
bag?
Was
that
your
paper
bag?

Yes,
Gustave
Dasté
Um,
trespass
and
theft
this
time.
His
hand
was
trespassing
-
of
removing
its
contents.


Be
quiet!
Keep...
Stop
your
sniffling,
-
with
your
filthy
little
mitts.
No,
of
course
I
wasn't
talking
to
you.
I
have
only
the
highest
respect
for
you.
No,
that
was
not
a
comment
-
That's
absurd.
I
have
not
heard
any
of
those
rumors.
Well,
I'm
sure
she
will
return.
-
Come
on,
you
little
vermin.

So
here's
the
little
-
This
is
the
one.

What
do
you
think
I
should
do
about
her?
-
What?
About
what?

-
Oy!
-
Hey!
Come
on!
Go
on,
get
in
there!
-
Do
you
think
it's
mine?
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
-
Sure
it's
yours?
Of
course
it's
yours.
When's
the
last
-
Uh...
-
No,
I
don't
think
so.
If
you
should
see
her,
please...
Oh.
You
sure
you
want
her
back?

Oh,
yes,
yes.

Ready?



Robin
Hood.
With
Douglas
Fairbanks.
I've
never
seen
a
movie.
-
What?
You've
never
seen
a
movie?
Papa
Georges
won't
let
me.
-
He's
very
strict
about
it.
My
father
always
took
me
Hugo...
is
your
father
dead?
I
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
Isabelle...
do
you
want
to
have


We
could
get
into
trouble.
That's
how
you
know
it's
an
adventure.


-
How
did
you
two
rats
get
in
here?!
Come
on!
And
I'd
better
not
see


Why
doesn't
Papa
Georges

I
don't
know.
He
never
said.
I
bet
my
parents
would've
let
me.
What
happened
to
them?
They
died...
when
I
was
a
baby.
But
Papa
Georges
and
Mama
Jeanne,
so
they
took
me
in.
They're
very
nice
about
most
everything,

My
father
took
me
He
told
me
about
the
first
one
He
went
into
a
dark
room,
he
saw
a
rocket
fly
-
It
went
straight
in.
He
said
it
was
like
seeing
The
movies
were
our
special
place...
where
we
could
go
we
didn't
miss
my
mum
so
much.
You
think
about
him
a
lot,
don't
you?
All
the
time.
Hugo,
um...
where
do
you
live?

There.

My
uncle
taught
me
So
I
just
keep
on
doing
it.
Maybe
he'll
come
back
one
day,
Aren't
you
afraid
someone
will
find
out?
Not
as
long
as
the
clocks
keep

-
Act
natural.
Just
keep
on
walking.

How
am
I
acting
now?

You
two,
halt!
Come
here.

Good
day,
monsieur.
I
work
with
my
Papa
Georges
Surely
you've
seen
me
there
before.
And
this
is
my
cousin



You'll
have
to
forgive
him.
He's
quite...
simple-minded.
Poor
thing.
Seems
Maximilian
doesn't
like
He
is
disturbed
by
your
physiognomy.
He
is
upset
by
your
visage.
Why
would
he
not
like
your
face?
Eh?
Well,
perhaps
he
smells
my
cat.
-
Cat?
Christina
Rossetti's
her
name,
Would
you
like
me
to
recite?
My
heart
is
like
a
singing
bird
Whose
nest
is
in
a
water'd
shoot
My
heart
is
like
an
apple
tree
Whose
boughs
are
bent
with
thick-set...
All
right,
all
right.
That's
enough
poetry
for
today.
I
love
poetry,
particularly
-
Rossetti.
She's
one
of
my
favorites.
I
know
it's
Rossetti.
I
love
poetry,
just...
We're
here
to
either
Or
work
in
different
shops,
-
Yes,
sir.
Go
on,
go.

Doltish?
Now,
since
I
just
saved
your
life,
how
about
letting
me
see
-
My
what?
I
have
to
go
now.
I
have
things
to
do.
Hold
on!
You've
seen
my
house.
After
all,
I
am
your
only
friend.
You're
not
my
only
friend.
Being
enigmatic
really
doesn't
suit
you.
-
What
are
you
up
to?
I
should
never
have
left


Hugo!


-
Where
did
you
get
this?
-
I
need
it.
I
just
need
it.
Not
unless...
Not
unless
you
tell
me
why.
Come.
This
is
marvelous.
Oh,
this
is
superlative.
What
is
that?

It's
an
automaton.
My
father
was
fixing
it...
Why
would
my
key
fit
He
looks
sad.


For
what?
To
work
again.
To
do
what
he's
supposed
to
do.
What
happens
when
you
wind
him
up?
I
don't
know.
What's
the
matter?
I
know
it's
silly...
but
I
think
it's
going





What
an
idiot,
to
think
I
could
fix
it.


-
Hugo...
It'll
always
be
broken!
-
Look...
Hugo,
look,
it
doesn't
-
You
can
fix
it.
You
don't
understand.
I
thought...
if
I
could
fix
it,

Hugo!
Hugo,
look!
Look,
it's
not
done.
It's
not
writing...
it's
drawing.


That's
the
movie


Georges
Méliès?
That's
Papa
Georges'
name.
Why
would
your
father's
machine
I
don't
know.
Thank
you.
It
was
a
message
from
my
father.
And
now
we
have
to
figure
it
out.
Come
on.

Come
on.
Mama
Jeanne,
we...
This
is
Hugo
Cabret.
Good
evening,
ma'am.
Very
good
manners...
for
a
thief.
I'm
not
a
thief.
What's
going
on,
Isabelle?
Oh,
well,
it's
a
terribly
long
story
but
do
you
remember
Wait!
Mama?

Oh,
children.
What
have
you
done?
You'll
call
me
a
liar.
No,
Child.
A
mechanical
man
drew
it.
Do
you
have
him?
My
father
found
him
in
a
museum.
Nobody
wanted
him.
We
fixed
it.
No,
but
it
needed
my...
my
key.
-
The
key
I
gave
you.
No.
No,
you
take
this
away.
Whatever
happens,
you
don't
let
-
Please
tell
us
what's
going
on.
You
must
both
forget
this.
My
father
and
I,

I
need
to
know
what
this
means.
Please.
There
are
things
You
should
not
yet

-
It's
Papa
Georges.

Quiet!
Now
just
keep
quiet.
I'll
find
a
way
Not
a
noise
from
either
of
you.
She
looked
at
the
armoire.
I
already
searched
it
when
I'll
look
again.
Splendid.

-
Where's
Fizzie?
Not
on
the
stairs?
Didn't
you
-
No.

Look.
We
have
to
investigate.
Let
me.
I'm
taller.
-
Knock
on
it.






Back
from
the
dead.
Stop.
Stop,
Georges.
-
Stop
it!
This
is
your
work!
What
am
I?
Nothing
but
a
penniless
merchant!
I
trusted
you.
This
is
how
you
thank
me.
You're
cruel.
Cruel.
I
should
get
back.
OK.
Thank
you...
for
the
movie
today.
It...
It
was
a
gift.

Sorry,
I...
You
know
this
volume?
My
father
and
I
Hmm.
It
is
intended
for...
my
godson.
But
now
I
think
it
is
intended...
for
you,
Monsieur
Cabret.
Might
I
have
another
cup?
Still
brewing.
Soon.
Demitasse,
like
everything
else,
If
we
only
knew
when
that
moment
was.
Oh,
Gustave,
be
intrepid.
Say
hello
to
her.
Come
on,
give
me
your
best
smile.
Your
best
smile.
It's
beautiful.
Radiant!

Thank
you.
-
Oh.
A
very
gracious
good
evening
to
you.
-
Monsieur
Inspector.
Hmm,
yes.
Those
are
lovely
posies,
those.
Thank
you.
Yes,
they're
from
Gourdon.
They
come
in
on
the
overnight
train,
Ah,
Gourdon.
Splendid
country,
that.
Robust.
The
weather...
Perfectly
formed
udders.
Yeah.
Are
they...
Are
they
smelly?
Are
they
smelly
flowers?
Oh,
um...
yes,
a
little.

You
see,
I
was
injured
in
the
war,
Good
evening,
mademoiselle.
I
lost
my
brother.
Where?
Verdun.
Good
evening,
Monsieur
Inspector.
Very
good
evening,

me?

The
Invention
of
Dreams...
by
René
Tabard...
The
Story
of
the
First
Movies.

"In
1895,
was
called
A
Train
Arrives
"which
had
nothing
more
than

"
"
When
the
train
came
the
audience
screamed,
-
"were
in
danger
of
being
run
over."
"No
one
had
ever
seen
"No
one
had
ever
seen

"
"
What
began
as
a
sideshow
when
the
first
filmmakers
discovered
"they
could
use
the
new
medium

Wow.
"The
filmmaker
Georges
Méliès..."
was
one
of
the
first
films
had
the
power...
"...to
capture
dreams."
"The
great
pioneer
"...the
Great
War."
Died?
-
During
the
Great
War?
Uh...
yes.
It's
allowed.
IS
it?
He's
my
godfather,
you
see.
And
very
much
alive,
But
that's
not
possible.
I
assure
you,
sir...
it's
true.
Why
should
I
believe
you?
Because...
Because
it's
true.
Méliès
alive?


Shh!
Come
with
me.
Your
godfather
is
a
passion
of
mine.
He
was
a
great
filmmaker.
Here
he
is
at
work
in
his
studio.
And
this
is
a
handbill
Here
is
the
great
crystal
mystery
clock
made
by
his
mentor,
Robert-Houdin.
And
this...
is
one
of
his
-
He
was
a
magician?


No
one
really
knows.
Look
how
happy
he
is.
Professor
Tabard,
would
you
perhaps...
like
to
meet
him?
Oh...
but
you
see,
I
have
met
him.
My
brother
worked
as
a
carpenter
One
day
he
took
me
to
It
was
like...
The
whole
building
In
reality,
this
was
to
let
in
but
to
my
eyes,
an
enchanted
castle.
A
palace
made
of
glass.

We
need
more
light!

Get
the
louvers
opened.
Clear
the
set,
please!

Actors
only
on
the
set,
please.

Why
we
doing
this
again?
There
was
a
lobster
OK,
if
that
happens
again,
If
it's
clear,
give
me
a
"clear."
If
you've
ever
wondered
you
look
around.
This
is
where
they're
made.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
sun
will
set!
Knights
in
position,
Mermaids
in
position.
Action!

In
the
end,
He
was
phenomenally
But...
why
did
he
stop?
Up
until
today,
I
believed
like
so
many
others.
Could
we
watch
some
of
his
movies?
I
wish
you
could.
But
time
hasn't
been
kind
to
old
movies.
This
is
the
only
one
Out
of
hundreds,
one.
And
Still...
it
is
a
masterpiece.


We've
got
to
get
Tabard
Then
he'll
see
he's
not
forgotten.
Shouldn't
I
tell
Mama
Jeanne?
No.
I
think
it
should
be

We
need
to
have
some...
panache.
Panache.
Well
done!


Monsieur
Claude?
Shh.

Are
you
up
there?
Monsieur
Claude,
was
that
you?
Keep
a
grip
onto
your
spanners,
You
can
hold
onto
a
bottle
Are
you
inebriated?
Chateauxed,
are
we?
He's
passed
out.
He's
passed
out,
isn't
he?
You
bloated
buffoon!
Could've
hurt
a
child.


Jules
Verne.
Yes,
indeed.
-
Not
unknown
in
France.
Very
good
plates.
Monsieur
Labisse
gave
me
He's
always
doing
that,
That's
what
he
calls
it.
He's
got
real...

Purpose.
What
do
you
mean?

Everything
has
a
purpose,
Clocks
tell
the
time
They
do
what
they're
meant
to
do.
Like
Monsieur
Labisse.
Maybe
that's
why
They
can't
do
what
they're
meant
to
do.
Maybe
it's
the
same
with
people.
If
you
lose
your
purpose,
Like
Papa
Georges.
Maybe
we
can
fix
him.
Is
that
your
purpose,
fixing
things?
I
don't
know.
It's
what
my
father
did.
I
wonder
what
my
purpose
is.
I
don't
know.
Maybe
if
I
had
known
my
parents...
I
would
know.
Come
with
me.

Right
after
my
father
died,
I'd
imagine
the
whole
world
Machines
never
come
They
always
come
with
So
I
figured
if
the
entire
world
I
couldn't
be
an
extra
part.
I
had
to
be
here
for
some
reason.
And
that
means
you
have

Get
back.
I'll
bring
Tabard
Don't
say
anything.
Are
you
sure
about
this?
Not
really.
But
I
think
it's
the
only
way
to...
To
fix
him.

Hello.
How
was
your
day'?



Boy
on
the
track!
Get
out
of
the
way!
-
Turn
it
off!
Get
out
of
the
way!
Move!
-
Out!

Ahh!

Look
out!









Morning.
Yes,
he's
employed
here.
In
the
Seine?
Deceased?
Are
you
sure?
No,
he
has
no...
no
relatives.
Thank
you,
I'll...
Thank
you
so
much.
If
he
is
deceased...
then
who
has
been


Good
evening.

I'll
get
it.
Well,
what
a
surprise.

Please
don't
be
mad,
Mama.
That
young
man
is
not
welcome
here.
We
found
out
who
Papa
Georges
is.
I...
I
deeply
apologize,
madame.
I
will
leave
immediately

Please
keep
your
voices
down.
My
husband's
sleeping.
No,
Mama.
Mama,
please
I-I
don't
wish
to
impose
but
if
this
is
to
be
please,
let
me
express
to
you
the
profound
debt
of
gratitude
When
I
was
a
boy,
They
inspired
me.
Your
husband
is
a
very
great
artist.
Oh,
I
am
so
pleased
you
remember
my
husband's
films
But...
he's
so
fragile
now.
It
only
hurts
him
to
remember
the
past.
Then
we
will
take
our
leave,
madame.
And
I
do
hope
you'll
you
are
as
lovely
now

Mama?
She
appeared
in
almost
all
his
films.
-
You
were
an
actress?
Was
a
long
time
ago,
children.
It
was
another
time.
I,
uh...
I...
Well,
I
was
another
person.
Would
you
like
to
meet
her
again?
We
have
a
film.
One
of
Georges'
films?
That's
not
possible.
They're
all
gone.
May
we
show
you?

Please.


You
were
an
actress,
-
It's
impossibly
romantic,
Mama.
We
weren't
movie
stars
But
we
did
have
fun.
Madame
Méliès?



It's
in
color!

But
of
course.
We
painted
it
by
hand,
Mama,
it's
you!
Yes.

Oh,
beautiful.
You
were
beautiful.

She
still
is.
I
would
recognize
the
sound

Georges...
you've
tried
to
forget
It's
brought
you
nothing
Maybe
it's
time
to
try
and
remember.

You
want
to
know?
Yes.
Just
like
you...
I
loved
to
fix
things.
I
started
out
as
a
magician.
Mama
Jeanne
was
my
assistant.


We
were
very
successful,
I
must
say.

But
I
was
always
tinkering
I
had
my
own
workshop
at
the
theater,
Once,
I
even
built
a
Oh,
he...
was
a
particular
treasure.
I
put
my
heart
and
soul
into
him

Then,
one
night,
went
to
visit
a
traveling
circus.
We
were
walking
past
the
sideshow
tents
Something
strange.
It
will
terrify
you!
Sir,
madame,
inside
we
have


The
Lumière
brothers


I
fell
in
love
with
their
invention.
It
was
like...
I
asked
the
Lumière
brothers
You
see,
they
were
convinced
and
they
saw
no
future
in
it,
In
the
end,
I
built
my
own
camera
using
leftover
pieces
I
just
had
to
be
a
part
We
risked
everything.
And
we
sold
so
we
could
build
Excellent.

Cameras,
are
we
clear?

Actors
only
on
the
set,
please!
Look
at
you,
look
at
you!
It's
a
toile,
though,
right?

in
hundreds
of
movies.
I'm
ready.


Oh,
that
was
good,
That
felt
good,
that
felt
good.

Stop,
stop,
stop.
I
saw
that.
Give
me
two
minutes.
Benny'?
I'm
gonna
have
a
word.

Reload.
Reset
the
dragon.
Benny,
speak
to
me.
If
you
pull
down
a
little
harder
the
head
will
come
up
higher,
-
Under
the
belly!
Excellent,
excellent,
excellent.
The
choreography
was
really
good
-
First
positions!
Action!
Excellent,
excellent.
And
in
for
the
kill,
knights.
Come
on,
then,
attack!
Stabbing,
stabbing,
and
lunge!
Good.
Good,
good.
Good,
knights.
And...
knights!
Three,
two,
one,
freeze!
Skeletons,
that's
great.
Pyrotechnics
in,
please.
Freeze.
Freeze,
everybody.
Three,
two,
one,
action!

Magic
tricks
and
illusion
The
world
of
imagination.
My
beautiful
wife
And
we
couldn't
have
been
happier.
Action!
We
thought
it
would
never
end.
How
could
it?
But
then
the
war
came.

The
world
had
no
time
The
returning
soldiers,
were
bored
by
my
films.
Tastes
had
changed,
No
one
wanted
my
movies
any
more.
Eventually
I...
or
keep
the
business
and
so
my
enchanted
castle
Everything
was
lost.
One
night,
in
bitter
despair,
I...
I
burned
all
my
old
sets
I
was
forced
to
sell
my
movies
that
melted
them
down
These
chemicals
were
used
With
the
little
money
I
had
from
selling
and
there
I
have
remained.
The
only
thing
I
couldn't
was
my
beloved
automaton.
So
I
gave
him
to
a
museum,
But
they
never
put
him
on
display.
It's
all
gone
now.
Nothing
but
ashes
My
life
has
taught
me
and
not
the
one
I
thought
it
would.
Happy
endings
only
happen
in
the
movies.
I'll
be
right
back.




Stop
that!
No,
no!
Schatzi,
what's
he
got?

Oh,
my
goodness.

Did
you
see
that?
Be
brave.
My
brave
soldier.
Oh!
Monsieur
Frick,
I
am
undone!

-
Good
evening.
There
has
been
-
What
is
it?
-
Mm-hmm.


No.
Consequently,
he
will
no
longer
be
You've
got
a
little
friend.
Look!
-
Oh,
hello.
-
Monsieur
Claude
is
dead.
What?
Why'?
What
happened
to
him?
They
found
his
corpse
in
the
Seine.
It's
been
down
there
Can't
say
I'm
surprised.
He
was
an
inebriant
-
Well,
yes,
he
was
a
drunk.
-
Oh,
I
wouldn't
say
that.
Scram!
Shoo!
He
could've
drunk
-
Please,
go
away!
Go!
Shh.
-
Hold
it!
-
Let
me
go!
Let
me
go!
-
Gustave,
have
a
heart!

Please.
He's
been
undermining
Come
on!
-
What's
the
boy
done?
-
You
happy
now,
boy?!
Do
not
leave
my
office.
You
don't
understand,
You'll
go
nowhere
I
don't
have
any!
Then
it's
straight
You'll
learn
a
thing
or
two
there.
How
to
follow
orders.
How
to
survive
without
a
family.
Because
you
don't
need
one.
Police
headquarters,
Yes,
it's
me
again.
Has
been
a
busy
week.
Oh,
trespass,
theft,
pilfering,
walking
about,
playing.
Please
come
and
pick
him
up.
Anyway,
how
are
you?
Oh,
she
came
back?
Oh,
you
think
it's
yours?
Well,
I
suppose
you'll
find
out

Pardon
me.
Oh,
in
March?
I...
I
tend
not
to
plan
Are
you
sure?
Well,
oh,
that's
very
flattering.
I
don't
know
really
whether
it's
Oh!
Sir,
hold
on!
Maximilian!
Move!
Move
aside!
Get
out
of
the
way!

Maximilian,
find
him!
You
can't
escape
me!



There's
nowhere
to
hide
up
there,
boy!

307,
308,
309...




Maximilian,
he's
gone


You!
Get
out
of
my
way!

Got
you!


-
Oof!

No!
Oh!
There's
a
boy!
Turn
it
off!
Get
out
of
the
way!


Move
back!
Move
aside!
What
were
you
thinking?
-
Come
on!
Stand
aside.
Careful.
We'll
let
the
orphanage
-
No,
I
don't
belong
there!
A
child
has
to
belong
to
somewhere.
Listen
to
me,
please!
You
don't
understand.

I
don't
understand
Why
I'm
alone.
This
is
my
only
chance...
to
work.
You
should
understand!

I
do!
I
do.
Monsieur...
this
child
belongs
to
me.
I'm
sorry.
He's
broken.
No,
he's
not.
He
worked
perfectly.


Honored
guests,
I
am
proud
to
welcome
you
to
this
gala
celebrating
the
life
and
work


For
years,
most
of
his
films
Indeed,
Monsieur
Méliès
But
we
began
a
search.
We
looked
through
vaults,
barns
and
catacombs.
Our
work
was
rewarded
boxes
of
prints,
and
trunks
which
we
were
able
to
save.
We
now
have
over
80
films

And
tonight,
their
creator,
and
the
newest
member
is
here
to
share
them
with
you.


Bravo!

Bravo!
Ladies
and
gentlemen...
I...
I
am
standing
because
of
one
who
saw
a
broken
machine...
and
against
all
odds,
he
fixed
it.
It
was
the
kindest
magic
trick...
that
ever
I've
seen.
And
now,
my
friends,
I
address
you
all
tonight
Wizards,
mermaids...
travelers,
adventurers...
Come
and
dream
with
me.
Yes,
you
can
start
with
the
thaumatrope,
Any
study
of
the
history
of
film
Poppy'?
The
cave
pictographs
at...
-
Niaux.
About
canine
socialization.
Not
canine
romance?
Oh,
Monsieur
Frick,
do
I
detect

The
boy
designed
it.
Don't
forget
to
smile,
darling.
Well,
which
one?
Don't
worry.
I'm
now
a
fully
Tap
the
deck.
And
it's
up,
-
Is
this
your
card?

Once
upon
a
time,
He
lived
in
a
train
station.
"Why
did
he
live
in
a
train
station?"
That's
really
what
this
book
It's
about
how
searched
so
hard
to
find
and
how
that
message
lit
his
way.
All
the
way
home.
