Dude,

I

I
feel
like
an
idiot.
Are
you
comfortable?
Veronica's
not
going

it.
Get

Plus
you

Holy

You
can't
be
happy
all
the

Who
told
you
you
can't
be
happy?
It's
all
right.
You

Thank

Baby,
how's
it
going?
Great,

We're

Let's

Who,
who
doesn't

Well,
I
don't
have
an
iPod.
They
won't
let
me
make
any

Don't

about
it.
I

Me?
None.

I

Effexor,
so
I
stopped.
Klonopin?

Yeah.
Right?
It's

Trazodone!
Oh,
it

You

I

But
you're

What?
I'm
not
telling

Um,
maybe
I

You
can
drive
them
both

Now.
Stop
talking
about

You

Von,

No...
I
don't.
I
don't.
I
just
wanted
to
have
a
nice
dinner.
What
is
your

Nothing's
my
problem!
I'm
fine.
Come
on,
are
you
ready?
You
really,
you
really
want
to
go
right
now?
Yes,
I
really
want
to
go!
Okay,
guys,
the
baby
is
sleeping!
Sorry.
I
don't
want
to
wake
up
the
baby.
Listen,
I
haven't
dated
since
really
remember
how
this
works.
How
what
works?
I
saw
the
way
you
were
looking
at
me,
Pat.
You
felt
it,
I
felt
it,
don't
lie.
I
live
in
the
addition
around
back,
separate
from
my
parents'
house,
so
in
on
us.
I
hate
the
fact
that

I
hate
football,
but
you
can

How
old
are
you?
Old
enough
to
have
a

Look,
I
had
a
really
good
time
tonight
and
pretty,
but
I'm
married,
okay?
You're
married?
So
am
I.
No,
that's
confusing.
He's
dead.
Wait,
what?
What's
happening?
Oh,
my
God.
Hey.
Are
you
okay?
Ronnie
called.
Hey,
I
don't
know,
Mom.
What
happened
over
there?
When
am
I
going
to
get
a
phone?
You'll
get
a
phone
in
due
time.
What
happened?
Pat!
Mom!
I
can't
find
my
wedding
video.
What
is
it?
Where's
my
wedding
video?
It's
after
three
o'clock!
I
looked
in
here,
but
this
is
all
your
sewing
and
everything.
What
about
in
your
father's
study?
Don't
go
in
my

It
feels
to
me
like
you
want
to
Please
stop
yelling!
I'm
not
yelling,
Mom,
I'm
just
frustrated
because
I
should
have
my
fucking
wedding
video!
Pat!
Pat!
I
looked
over
there!
Calm
down,
Pat.
I'm
not
calming
down!
I'm
not
calming
down!
I'm
not
ashamed
of
it!
Let
the
whole
neighbourhood
wake
up!
Pat!
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
Stop

What's
going
on?
What?
I

Get
off

Dad!
Stop

that?
Keep
an
eye
on
him.
Is
this
a
bipolar

Get

Get

me!
Help
me!
You

Everything

Who

It
was
that
kid
with

Good

Hey,
I

Will
you

What?
Okay?
I'm

Well

why
don't
you

And
I
think
Pat,
you
have
to
have
a
strategy.
You
need
to
recognize
these
feelings
coming
back
to
Baltimore.
So
when
you
get
a
quieter
place,
and
be
at
peace
Yeah,

that's
easier

You
have
to

You

Yeah,

Listen,

No.
Why?
Because
you
have

What
good
are
you,
man?
Why
did
you
have
this
wedding

last
night?
Oh,
I
don't
know,
because
I'm

Hey!
How
do
you
know
when
I
run?
I
wanted
to
clarify
something.
I
just
want
us
to
be
friends.
Did
you
hear
what
I
said?
Why
are
you
giving
me
such
a
hard
time?
No,
I'm
not

Why
did

Because
you

I

I'd

how
I
lost
my

How
did
you
lose
your

By...
having
sex
with
everybody
in

Everybody?
I
was
very
depressed
after
Tommy
died.
We
don't

Thanks.
How

were
there?
Eleven.
Wow.
I

I'm
not

Okay.
Can
I
ask

one
more
question?
Were
there
any
women?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
What
was
that
like?
Hot.

Made
me
sit
on

and
do
things?
Yeah.
What?
You
sat
on
her
lap?
Mm-hmm.
She
told
you
what

that
you're
in.
Okay.
Yeah?
Right.
Hmm?
I
just
wanted

maybe
I
didn't,
spend

I
spent
too
much
time
with
your
feel
worse
about
your
behaviour,
but
know
how
to
handle
it.
I
mean,
that's
what
all
this
Eagles
stuff
is
about.
It's
about
us,
spending
time
can
to
help
you
get
back
on
your

I
wish
you'd

these
games
with
So
would
you,
would
you
just
come
downstairs
and
talk
to
me
and
Randy
now?
Randy,
tell
him
what
I'm
doing.
He's
betting
everything
on
the
Giant
game.
All
the
money
that
he
needs
for
the
restaurant,
Tell
him
why.
Because
he
believes
in
you.
I

in
you,
Patty.
I

So
I'm
going
to
bet
heavy
on
this
game.
You
understand?
Yeah.
Heavy.
I
want
you
to
go
to
the
game
with
your
brother.
You
want
me
to
go
to
the
game
with
Jake?
Of
course
I
do.
Does
he
want
me
to
go?
Of
course
he
wants
you
to
go.
He
told
you
that?
He
told
me,
yes.
Even
with
all
his
friends?
With
all
his
friends.
He's
not
embarrassed?
No.
I'd
love
to
go
to
the
game,
too,
from
the
stadium.
Cause
I'd
love
to
a
lot
of
money
from
this
asshole.
Listen,
personally,
I
think
it's
a
