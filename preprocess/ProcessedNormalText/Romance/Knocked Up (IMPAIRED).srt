I
thought
maybe
we'd
Cool.
Okay.
I'll
start.
I'm
Canadian.
From
Vancouver.

But
it
works
out
'cause
I

So
financially
that's
helpful
'cause
I
don't

You

Do
you
have

is
our
job.
We
don't
technically
get

it
is
our
job.
So,
how
do
you...
Right.
When

But
I
got
like
14
grand

Right.
I
mean,

now.
It's
been
almost
10
years.
So
that
should
last
me
for,
but

something
It's
kind
of
why
I
called
you.
Here

I
will
give
you
a
play-by-play
I

on
the
cusp,
I
didn't
mean

Well,
I
assumed

example,
It's
just

Get

smoke
marijuana.
You
can't
jump
on
trampolines.
This
is
basically
a
giant
list
Yeah,

Well,

It's
pretty
crazy,
We

We'll
help
her
raise
the
baby.
Well...
Fuck!
At
least
we
don't
have
But
we
can.
I
don't...
I
don't
have
VD
or
anything.
It's
not
that.
You
know,
it's
just...
I
thought
maybe
we
could
get
Okay,
first
of
all,
I
know,
of
course,
And
just
because
I'm
pregnant,
and
all
romance
Okay,

Sweet.
A
little,
so
far.
I

seven
months
We
don't
have
to
rush
it.
We
should
really
just
try
and
give
this
a
real
shot.
You
know,
we
got
ourselves
For
the
baby,
right?
Okay,
if
this
was
our
second
B.J.,
if
I'm
just
being
I
told
my
roommates
You
know
what?
For
the
sake
of
getting
Yeah,
I
can
do
that.
I'm
nervous,
too.
Yeah.
You're
a
sweet
guy,
right?
I
think
I
am.
Yeah.
Don't
fuck
me
over,
okay?
I
wouldn't
do
that.
Just
so
you
know,
I'm
that
guy.
Okay?
I
couldn't
take
it.
Who's
he?
I'm
Ben
Stone.
He's
my
boyfriend.
That's
nice.
I've
never
met
him
before.
Well,
he's
a
new
boyfriend.
But
a
boyfriend.
So
he
came
over
DEBBlE:

love
each
other
Mmm-mmm.
Do
you
love
each
other?
Yes,
they
love
each
other.
When
you
love
each
other,
Where
do
babies
come
from?
DEBBlE:
Where
do
you
think
Well,
I
think
a
stork,
and
then
a
hole
goes
and
there's
blood
everywhere,
and
then
you
push
and
then
you
hold
your
butt
and
you'll
find
a
little
baby.
That's
exactly
right.
Feed
the
teddy
bear.
Okay,
I
feed
Okay.
You
know
what
your
bear

Smoke
it.
What
do
you
think
of

Fetch!
DEBBlE:
Who
plays
fetch
ALLlSON:

it
back.
Where
does
that
end?
How
old
is
he?
Looks
33.
He
can
barely
get
in

Imagine
how
much
bigger
That
means
he

bad
genes.
Your
