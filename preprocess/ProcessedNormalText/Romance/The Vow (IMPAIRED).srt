That's
funny.
Actually,
that
is
funny.
So,
well,
you've
but
my
dad
will
say
to
call
him
And
my
sister's
name
is...
Gwen.
I
know
a
lot
about
Right.
Yeah.
We're
married.


Oh,
my
God,
you're
engaged!

PAIGE:
Wow.
You
guys
make
a
really
cute
couple.
Wow.
It
has
been
forever.
Has
it?
GWEN:
Yeah.

The
weird
thing
is
that
everyone
Really?
Yeah.
You,
Oh,
I'm...
I'm
so
happy
Voilà.
In
honor
of
Paige
being
home,
Filet
mignon.
Oh,
please.
Please.
Sit
down.
Before
we
start,
I
think
this
Darling?
Well,
I...
I
would
like
I
am
so
fortunate
to
have
these
and,
when
we're
all
together,
Paige,
honey,
welcome
home.
To
family.
ALL:
To
family.
So,
Leo,
Do
you
see
them
often?
No.
Oh,
that's
a
shame.
Both
my
parents
are
dead.
It's
just
Paige.
She's
my
family
now.
And
what
kind
of
I
just
opened
up
my
own
Paige
actually
convinced
me
I
did?
Yeah.
Isn't
that
sort
No,
I
just
mean,
on
their
computers
at
home
and
they
sound
just
as
good?
What?
Look,
the
records
that
I
like,
they
have
life
Like
the
slapback
on
Scotty
Look,
you're
not
gonna
get
You're
gonna
want
a
live
room,
You're
gonna
want
real
musicians
in
You...
I
guess,
to
answer
your
question,
and
you
can
record

you
can't
get
the
Sun
Wow.
Wow.
RITA:
Wow.

I
heard
everyone
is
This
kind
of
thing
might
be

Isn't
that

Chain?
Yeah,
we
don't

I
don't

Hi.

Sorry,
this
is...
Jeremy.
It's
been
a
long
time.
Has
it?
It
doesn't
seem
like
it.
I'm
not
sure
if
she
Hi.
Right.
You
guys
want
anything?
Disaronno
sour?
I'll
have
a
blueberry
mojito.
Really?
Yes,
I
remember.
SHANA:
Do
you
remember
when
we
and
we
were
getting
ready
we
were
curling
your
hair...
CARRIE:
We
ended
up
I
totally
remember
that!
And
didn't
I
wind
up
having
SHANA:
No,
no,
no,
It
was
like
she
was
mojito-drinking
Like
a
Stepford
wife?
Yeah,
basically.
She
was
even
flirting
with
Ex-fiancé
Jeremy?

No,
no.
No.
In
her
mind,
Which
is
why
it
was
to
have
her
stranger
husband
That
is
a
lot
to
So,
what
turns
her
on?
Paige?
No,
her
mother.
Yes,
Paige.
Like,
in
bed?
Oh,
my
God,
Leo.
What?
I
don't
know.
It's...
It's
kind
of
a
Hey,
I'm
not
gonna
judge.
She
likes
being
tickled.
Seriously?
Wow.
Thought
you
I'm
not.
I'm
just...
I...
I
don't
care
if
It's
not
like
that.
It
just
breaks
her
down
Okay.
Seriously?
Yeah.
What
do

PAIGE:
Hey,
Lisa.
Paige?
Because
I've
been
dealing
with
these
Something
important
I'm
gonna
call
you
Hi.
Please.
So,
you
remember
when
you
told
me
you'd
always
The
night
in
the
boathouse.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
can
you
please
tell
me
Only
you,
Paige,
then
come
back
So
I
dumped
you?
A
cruel,
hard,
Why?
Well,
that's
a
question
and
the
two
rebound
girls,
yeah,
we'd
all
Come
on,
seriously.
I
must
have
had
You...
You...
You
changed.
You
talked
differently,
You
weren't
sure
And
you
definitely
weren't
Did
I
give
you
your
ring
back?
Yeah,
you
did.
Who
has
that
now?
No
one
yet.
But
I've
been
with
Rose.
You
remember?
I've
been
with
Rose
I
couldn't
wait
forever,
Paige.
You
couldn't
have
anticipated
that
I'd
have
a
brain
trauma
and
come
waltzing
demanding
answers?
What's
wrong
with
you?

I'm
sorry.
I'm
gonna
Sure.
Sorry.
I
was
not
expecting
that.
Habit,
I
guess.
I
honestly
didn't
even
know
where
I
It
just
seems
that
I
shut
everyone
out
It
just
doesn't
feel
right.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh...

It
was
fine.
I'm
just
happy
to

Sorry
about
the
mess
here.
No
problem.
What,
are
you
collaging?
Do
I
collage?
No,
not
that
I
remember.

No,
you
know,
just
seeing
To
collage?
All
those
memories
just
so
I
thought
I'd
make
a
That's...
That's
great.
Yeah.
I
kind
of
rummaged
through
some
of
your
stuff.

It's
fine.
It's
fine.
I
even
have
a
certificate
from
the
Yes,
I
found
that.
See,
I
started
over
here.
I
found
some
family
photos,
me
when
That
was
easy
to
put
because
I
remember
that
stuff.
That's
good,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
I
guess
so.
But
what
I've
been
trying
to
do
is
pinpoint
before
everything
How's
that
going?
I
think
I
was
and
I
was
asking
them
if
they
had
And
I
don't
That's
it,
that's
all,
before
I
woke
up
in
a
hospital.
Oh,
no.
How
are
we
ever
gonna


God,
this
is
not
happening.
It's
okay.
This
is
not
happening.
Okay?
No,
no,
no,
no,

you
doing?
I'm
sorry.

sorry.
Was

of.

don't
have

have
to

the

My

just
up
to
her
and
we've
got
the

we
all
thought

just
seems
like
to
be
there
for
Gwen.
Okay.
But

about
all
the

I
talked
to
the
people
And
they
were
really
understanding
and

gonna

just
come
out

Okay,
thanks,
Dad.
I'm
sorry.
It's
just

I

Yeah?
No

Nope.
Well,
I'm
very
happy,
and
Oh.

What
a
relief.
Well...
So,
your

recall,
Not
really.
No,

That's
not

is
it?
Listen,
when
it
comes
to

seems
It's
wonderful.
Mrs.
Thornton,
could
I
just
talk
to
It's
okay,
Mom.
All
right.
Thanks.
Paige,
do
you
want
Yes.
Because
some
patients
fear
that

so
will
the

but
mercifully
Oh,
no,
that's
not
it.
I'm
not
afraid
of
the

So,
what
are
you
afraid
of?
I
guess
I
just...
I
mean,
what
if
I
don't
Or
what
if
I
like
it
too
much?
I...
I
just
don't
know.
I
only
did
one
psych
rotation,
so
this
may
be
terrible
advice.
But
I
think
you
have
to
You
can
still
decide
but
if
you
don't
at
least
open
yourself
up
I'm
afraid
you're
gonna
live


Hey.
I'm
here.
These
guys
are?

with
a

Right.
Okay,
Mikey,
sounds
amazing.
I
am
going
for
it.
The
bass

is
one
note.
Just
one
note.
Okay,
cool.
Take
two.

Wow.
You
look
different.
Yeah.
Going
for
I'm
gonna
say
but,
whatever,
it's
still
good.
Hmm.
So...
I'm
gonna
be

Sounds
really
good,
Mikey.
Let's
just
take
it
from
the
top
You
know
what?
People
come
I
mean,
I'm
doing
my
best,
I
know.
But
if
Paige
is
in
Lake
that's
where
I
gotta
be.
I
gotta
make
my
wife

Oh,
you
found
each
other.
Let's
see
it.
It's
good
to
see
you.
The
countdown's
on,
man.
One
week
left
of
How
you
feeling?
I
feel
pretty
good,
actually.
I
mean,
I
do
get
a
little
dizzy
if
I
think
about
it
What?
No,
honey,
it's
like
It's
like
panic
or
excitement.
Well,
panic
and
excitement
Honey,
there's
gonna
Right.
Hey,
do
you
also
have
a
little
Yeah.
Is
that
bad?
Do
you
listen
Uh-huh.
Thom
Yorke,
he
talks
about
He
says
when
that's
how
he
knows
that
he's
And
then
he
gets
that
he
almost
passes
out.
Ryan,
it
sounds
to
me
like
That's
cool,
man.
Ooh,
Ryan,
I
have
someone
Mom,
you
listen
Yeah.
Why
wouldn't
I?

So,
is
that
true?
Mmm-hmm.
Paige?
Hey,
Leo.
What?
It
looks
so
different.
You
look
beautiful.
Thank
you.
Okay,
look,
so
I've
been
Okay.
What's
your
favorite
book?
It's
probably
not
That's
fine.
Okay.
The
Beach
House
No,
really?
Okay.
The
Beach
House.
Okay,
if
it
was
great,
you
probably
Yeah.
Gwen,
I
think.
Okay,
and
you
probably
"God,
I
wish
I
was
the
"so
that
I
could
experience
Yeah,
I
guess
so.
That's
how
I
think
What?
You
can't
remember
how
we
met.
Mmm-hmm.
And
you
can't
remember
And
in
a
way,
yeah,
that
sucks.
But
it
was
I
just
thought
to
get
to
experience
it
Like
reading
your
favorite
Exactly.
Which
is
why
I
want
to

A
date?
Like
two
people
that
are
just
BILL:
Jeremy...
Yeah,
I'm
sorry.
Well,
I
don't
know.
we've
got
But
if
we
go
out
before
then,
you
might
still
be
able
I
can't
promise
anything,
but
I'll
put
in

All
right.


So,
I
have
an
idea,
but
it
You
okay
with
that?
Yeah,
that's
fine.
I
just
have
to
be
back
Oh,
my
God.
What?
First
date
and
you're
already
inviting
yourself
I'm
just
a
little
No,
I
just
meant...
Don't
worry.
If
you
wanna
I
mean,
it's...
You
wanna
just
see
♪
You
can
love
me
foolishly
♪
Love
me
foolish-like
♪
Well,
I
wake
♪
In
the
morning
and
dress
♪
Should
we
get
out?
We
don't
have
to.
Is
this
the
part
of
the
date
you're
not
actually
my
husband
but
some
crazy
stalker,
and
you're
gonna
strangle
me
No.
This
is
where
we
first
met.
Oh.
I'm
gonna
take
you
on
Mmm.
That
is
so
good.
You
ready
for
dessert?
Dessert?
We
just
had
waffles.
Mmm-mmm.
These
are
dessert.
Well,
how
do
you
know
It's
like
a
chocolate
Russian
roulette.
We'd
be
surprised
and
the
ones
we
didn't.
Okay.
And...
You
don't
like
it?
I
do
not
like
that
one.
Here.
Try
this
one
I
think
Oh?
Told
you.
Your
turn.
Are
we
going
shot
for
shot?

Wait
till
you
try
We
would
come
here
Are
you
trying
to
make
me
No,
I...

You
got
a...

So,
we
come
down
here
at
That's
not
exactly
what
we
do.
I...
I'm
not...
I
don't...

We
said
we'd
go
in
and
we
haven't
done
April
yet.
We
started
in
July.
Why?
Why
would
we
do
that?
We
were
at
and
we
had
this
waiter
And
he
was,
like,
80.
Yeah.
Now,
we
said
You're
serious.
...for
you,
I
guess

All
right.
Turn
around.

Turn
around.
Okay.
Wait.
No
wetsuit?
We
said
no
wetsuits,
right?



Yeah.
Oh,
no.
No,
no.
No,
no!



Come
on.


Thank
you.
Heat,
heat.
My
left
eyelid's
frozen
shut.

I
can't
feel
my
fingers.

I
can't
feel
them.


I
don't
know
what
your
but
with
me,
you're
Okay.
I'm
sorry.
My...
My
lips

It's
nice.
Second
base,
tops.
This
is
perfect.
Thank
you
for
coming
out
I
had
a
really
nice
time.
I've
missed
you.
I
miss
our
life
together.
I
love
you.
I
should
probably
get
inside.
Good
night.
Good
night.

Hey.
Hey.
I
didn't
know
Were
you
out
with
Jeremy?
No.
I
was
with
Leo.
I
like
him.

Yeah.
Me,
too.
Are
you
okay?

Paige,
I've
never
seen
I
mean,
is
this
Because
it's
bizarre.
I
don't
know.
I
have
a
tattoo.
And
I'm
a
vegetarian,
too.
Look,
it
was
just
like
it
used
to
be.
Everything
that
about
Paige
is
still
there.
You
know,
to
you,
like
a
confirmation
or
your
marriage,
right?
But
to
her,
like
a
really
good
first
date.
Exactly.
Which
is
why
the
requisite
three
days
I
gotta
wait
three
days
to
call
after
a
date
At
least.
This
is
a
unique
case.
It
can't
be
longer.
I'm
gonna
see
her
I'm
telling
you,
Even
with
all
this
crazy
shit
going
on
Obvious
to
her
or
to
you?
To
both
of
us.
RITA:
Oh.
Oh,
Paige?
We
have
to
start
writing
out
Yes.
Before
you
start
on
that,
I
have
a
little
surprise
Oh?
You
know
Ray
Porter,
right?
He
taught
constitutional
law
He
and
I
were
on
We've
known
each
other
He
is
the
dean
of
Okay.
And
they're
gonna
What?
Well...
I
didn't
even
apply.
I
took
care
of
it.
This
is
crazy.
I
feel
like
I'm
getting




You
look
like

But
you
haven't
had
this.
All
right.
I'm
glad
we're
I
haven't
gotten
a
chance
Yeah.
Yeah,
cool.
Congratulations.
That's
nice.
Yes,
it
is.
I've
been
thinking.
And
I
think
that
it's
probably
Take
what?
Things
with
Paige.
Look,
I
know
she
didn't
have
you
chose
to
live
and
I
know
you
must
But
I
also
know
What's
that?
Divorce
her.
The
bills
have
Mr.
Thornton,
I
don't
think
or
the
place
to
discuss
this.
Fine.
If
you
don't
care
which,
clearly,
you
don't,
what
about
Paige?
What
about
doing
the
right
thing
for
her?
And
you
know
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
do.
You're
such
a
hypocrite.
What
did
you
say?
If
you're
such
I
never
once
saw
to
put
things
back
You're
such
a
coward.
Hey,
can
I
introduce
Can't
feel
good
to
I'm
not
the
odd
man
out.
All
right.
You
just
seem
a
little
creepy
I'm
just
waiting
All
right,
well,
You
like
this,
right?
I'm
sorry,
like
what?
Paige
leaves
you
behind.
She
goes
and
has
with
some
guy
that
no
one
gets.
And
now
you
get
to
I
mean,
I
like
it
Yeah?
Well,
let
me
I
like
the
fact
everything
about
you,
Jeremy.
Okay.
She
told
me
that
she
would
wake
up
thinking,
Wow.
She
told
you
everything,
huh?
Mmm-hmm.
Did
she
tell
you
at
me
the
other
day?
Did
she
tell
you
that?
Or
did
she
stop
when
she
forgot
Look,
I
get
why
You
obviously
love
her,
and
you
think
you're
But
the
thing
is,
What
makes
you
think
Thank
you
for
that
advice.
I
will
mull
it
over
while

Leo!
Paige,
wait!
What
the
hell
I
don't
know.
That's
because
I
have
been
making
a
complete
ass
Literally
trying
to
try
to
save
what
we
have.
And
you've
been
throwing
That's
not
fair.
It's
not
fair?
I
see
the
way
you
look
at
him.
I
know,
because
you
used
to
Leo,
I...
No,
I
think
we
need
to
Your
memory's
not
coming
back.
The
fact
is
that
I'm
not
trying
to
hurt
you.
But
I'm
just...

I'm
so
tired
of
I
know.
I'm
so
sorry.
I'll
apologize

Wedding
disasters
have
a
way
Eventually.

How
do
you
look
at
and
tell
yourself
Leg?
I
hope
one
day
I
can
love
You
figured
it
out
once.
You'll
do
it
again.

Shit.
You're
here,
not
there.
Are
you
okay?
I'm
done.
It's
over.
I
give
up.
No,
you
never
give
up,
Leo.
No,
if
we
were
we
would
be
together.
I
was
just
thinking
that
we
went
to
on
the
corner.
There
was
"Now
Serving
Soup,"
and
I
just
started
to

that
the
owner
to
achieve
his
lifelong
dream

And
then...
She
didn't
say
anything
and
she
just...
She
just
sort
of
exhaled
it.
It
was
almost
to
herself.
"I
love
you."
And
it
just
hung
there.
It
was
the
first
time
and
I
didn't
I
just
wanted
to
That
was
two
weeks
It
only
took
her
two
weeks
to
fall
in
love
with
me
before.
She
doesn't
love
me.

Sign
here,
please.

Come
here,
little
buddy.

Diane?
Hey.
How
are
you?
I
know
it's
been
years.
I
was
away
for
awhile.
I
never
had
a
chance
I
was
just
going
through
but
your
dad
ended
it
as
soon
as
your
mother
And
I
just
always
I
don't
mean
to
I
just
really
needed
No,
I'm
really
glad
You
were
always
I
just
wish
I
could've
GWEN:
The
lilies
were
bad,
I
wanted
to
tell
you.
You
knew?
You
knew
the
whole
time?
I'm
sorry.
Paige.
Paige.
Paige!
Hey,
where
have
you
Hmm?
Paige?
I
ran
into
Diane
Chain
That's
why
I
left,
isn't
it?
Mom,
I
barely
and
then
it
turns
out
and
you've
used
my
accident
I
couldn't
bear
the
thought
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
I'm
sorry,
Paige.
We
were
happier
than
Oh,
Mom!
We
finally
had
you
back
again.
Back
on
your
terms!
No!
Yes,
as
usual!
He
cheated
on
you
How
could
you
stay
with
him?
I...
I
was
going
to
leave.
I
was.
And
then
one
afternoon,
I
and
I
started
looking
at
and
your...
And
your
sister.
And
the
house
seemed
We
were
a
family,
Paige.
And
I
realized
that
was
the
most
important
And
I
couldn't,
I
couldn't,
I
could
not
go.
So,
you
just
WASPed
it
away?
No.
I
chose
to
stay
with
him
for
all
the
things
and
not
to
leave
him
for
the
one
I
chose
to
forgive
him.
Maybe
Leo
was
right.
Maybe
I
can't
figure
out
who
I
LEO:
I
still
feel
a
little
chilly.

That's
fine.
Paige.
I'm
sorry.
Is
everything
okay?
Look,
you
two
obviously
need
Okay.
All
right,
bye.
I'm...
I'm
sorry.
What
happened?
Can
I
ask
you
something?
Yeah.
You
can
always
ask
me
anything.
Did
you
know
Yeah.
I
knew.

Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
There
were
so
many
times
But
to
drive
you
away
That
just
felt
wrong.
I
wanted
your
love,
I...
Just
not
like
that.
I
wanted
to
earn
it.
I
just
don't
think
I
can
So
don't.

PAIGE:
Thanks
for
lunch.
Actually,
there's
something
Okay.
Things
are
over
with
Rose.
I
ended
it,
Paige.
No.
Why
did
you
do
that?
I
thought
you
were
We
were,
No,
that
was
after
me.
Okay,
it
was
after
you,
It
was
before
Jeremy,
I'm
not
the
old
me.
I'm
just
me.
I'm
just
the
me
that's
trying
I
understand,
the
old
you
or
the
new
you,
I
know
you
remember
I
know
you
do.
This
is
our
chance
What
we
had
was
wonderful.
Those
were
wonderful
memories,
Those
are
my
only
memories.
Everything
after
you
is
erased.
I...
I
have
to
discover
what
it's
like
Are
you
sure
you
don't
remember
breaking
up
with
me
Why?
'Cause
it
sounded
Let's
go.
Hey.
I
was
worried
when
I
didn't
So...
How's
that
intellectual
Actually,
I
wanna
I've
decided
to
And
I'm
gonna
get
It's
happening
Damn
it,
Paige.
I've
made
a
lot
of
mistakes.
Dad,
this
isn't
about
you
This
is
about
me,
Just
tell
me
what
to
say,
You
won't.
LEO:
A
moment
of
impact.
A
moment
of
impact
has
ripple
effects
far
sending
some
particles
making
them
closer
than
before,
while
sending
others
spinning
landing
where
you
never
You
see,
that's
the
thing
You
can't,
no
matter
how
hard
you
try,
control
how
You
just
gotta
Jet
the
colliding
and
wait
until
PAIGE:
I
vow
to
to
always
hold
you
and
to
have
the
patience
To
speak
when
words
are
needed
and
to
share
the
silence
To
agree
to
disagree
And
to
live
within
and
always
call
it
home.


Hi.
Hi.
I
hope
you
didn't
into
the
city
Actually,
I
moved
I'm
over
in
Rogers
Park.
Really?
That...
I'm
actually
back
What?
Mmm-mmm.
That's
amazing.
Yeah.
I
mean,
I'm
sitting
and
it's
crazy
that
my,
you
know,
Yeah.
So,
thank
you.
I
didn't
do
anything.
You
did
everything.
You
accepted
me
for
who
I
am,
and
not
for

I
just
wanted
you
to
be
happy.
That's
all.
Isn't
there
some
where
we
used
to
go
Yeah.
It's...
Wait.
No,
no.

I
wish.
No,
the
memory
stuff
Sonia
and
I
have
been
and
I've
been
Really?
That
she
doesn't
think
you're
seeing
anyone
right
now.
She
just
happens
to
be
right.
You?
Are
you
seeing
anyone?
That's
good.
So,
do
you
wanna
go
With
me?
Okay.
Okay.
What
would
you
say
that
we
haven't
been
to
before?
Someplace
new?
I'd
like
that.
After
you.
