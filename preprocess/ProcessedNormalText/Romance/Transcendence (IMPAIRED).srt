Doctor
Casey:

This
created
brain

And
it's
capable
of,
er,

And,
um,
of
self-awareness.
The
effort
to
develop
a
strong
has
led
to
significant
in
the
field
as
well
as
our
understanding
But
while
some
focus
of
a
thinking
computer,
I
believe
the
journey
than
the
destination.
My
priority
is
to
use
my
colleagues'
to
develop
new
methods
for
And
in
the
hopes
of
finding

put,
to
save
lives.

To

And
build

that

then
again,

Will:
My

has
always
been
eager

I'll
just
settle

For
one
hundred
our
capacity
for
reason
The
combined
intellect
engineers,
mathematicians

...in
this
auditorium
pales
in
comparison
Once
online
a
sentient
machine
will
quickly
overcome
the
limits
And
in
a
short
time,
its
analytical
power
than
the
collective
intelligence
of
every
person
born

So
now
imagine
such
an
entity
with
a
full
range
Even
self-awareness.
Some
scientists
refer
to
this
I
call
it
"transcendence."
The
path
to

us
to
unlock

Is
there
a

And
if
so,
where
does
it
reside?
Man:

Yes,

So
you
wanna
create
a

Your

That's
a
very

with
you

so
let
me
stay
with
you
do
you
remember

I
remember
everything.

You
walked

on
Tuesday,

Rained
the
night
before,

Joseph
said
you
were

but
I
always
liked

You
were
the
most
beautiful



Will:
You
alright?

Yeah.


Take
a
look.

We've
made
a
breakthrough

We
can
rebuild
any
material

Synthetic
stem
cells,

The
medical
applications
It's
extraordinary.

They'll
be
scared
at
first.

But
once
they
see
what

I
think
that

And
I
think

Security
code.


Status.

Scared
the
shit
Sorry.
Drake,
I
got
it!
I
got
the
money.

Let's
go!
Will:
Put
him
on
the
table,
Evelyn:
Here.
Careful,
careful.

Now
step
back.
Step
back.
What
the
hell's
happening?

These
men
should
wait
Come
on
now.
Wait,
well,
what
are
you
We're
saving
him.


You're
not
afraid,
No.

My
crew
got
Well...
How
are
you?
Better.

Will:
The
physical
enhancements
What
do
you
mean?

He's
also
connected
to
me.

I
can
touch
you
now.
Oh,
Jesus.
Evelyn.
No,
no,
n-n-n-n-no.
I
can't.
I
can't.



Another
dream?
Yeah.
Yeah.

I
made
a
breakthrough

I
think
Okay.
I'll
get
dressed.
Take
a
look.
That's
gotta
weigh


Martin:
Welcome.
We're
glad
you're
here.
What
are
all
these
people

Rift
posted
a
video

It
went
viral.
What,
you
mean

These
people
are
suffering,

They
have
no
hope.

And
I'm
able
to
fix
them.

But
there
are
others

It's
time
Agent
Buchanan.
Doctor
caster.
Joseph.
So
good
to
see
you,
Evelyn.
Good
to
see
you,
too.
The
facility
is
5
stories
down
so
that
we
can
control

Welcome.

We're
glad
you're
here.
Buchanan:
Jesus
Christ.
Will?

You
surprised
to
see
me,
Um...
That
depends.

On
what?
Can
you
prove

That's
a
difficult
question,

Can
you
prove
that
you
are?

Well,
he
certainly
hasn't
lost


Quantum
processors.
This
is
astounding.
Is
all
this

We've
moved


Paul
has
been
blind

The
nanotechnology
targets

And
repairs

Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.

We're
not
hiding
anything.

These
people
all
came

looking
for
us
to
help
them.

So
we
did.

Now
they're
all
enhanced,

They
remain
autonomous,

but
they
can
also

Part
of
a
collective
mind.
This
is
staggering,
will.

Actually,

What
you're
seeing

of
what
we'll
achieve.
You
know,
we
were
afraid
that
it
but
I,
I,
I
think

Evelyn...
Are
you
alright?
I've
gotten
everything

Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
You
think
Clearly
his
mind
has
evolved
I'm
not
sure
Well,
whoever
it's
building
an
army

Yeah.
We
need
to

He's
made
more
of
them.
He
called
'em
hybrids.
You
think
people
I
know
someone
who
might.
Buchanan:
We
don't
want
Generally,
we
don't
Much
less
join
forces
Look,
I
know
it's
unusual,
It's
a
legit
threat.
Not
two
days
ago,
this
guy
was
beaten
to
within
Then
this
pops
up
And
the
computer
Mm-hm.
The
only
way
to
stop
it
is
Basically,
cut
power
to
every
It's
y2k.
Right.
And
why
do
we
need
We're
all
gonna
need
when
this
thing
It's
already
sideways.
You've
got
I
haven't
handwritten
anything
But
it
was
the
only
secure
way
How
did
they
turn
you?
How's
Evelyn?
She
can't
see
it
But
you
can?
Your
letter
says
If
those
hybrids
they're
running
on
software
Software
I
can
hack...
To
build
a
virus.
Well,
that
would
require
Which
would
require
help
from
your
friends
Yes.
We
need
hardware
the
machine
Nothing
with
a
microchip.


Will:
Fine.
Thank
you.

What
is
it?
Nothing.
Just,
I
don't,
I
don't

Oh.

Will,
can
you
not
do
that,


I
thought
it
might
make
you

Is
that
better?
Yes.

Evelyn,
Not
now.
I'm
not
doing
this.

I
don't
understand,
Evelyn.

These
are
your
dreams.

This
is
our
future.
No.
This,
You're
not
here
with
me.

You've
changed.

Have
you
fallen
No.

Have
you?
No.
No.
But...I
just
need
time

The
balance
of
oxytocin

in
your
system
is
unusual.
Are
you,
are
you
measuring

I'm
trying
to
empathize.

Biochemistry
is
emotion.
Show
me
everything

Why?
Now!
No,
will,
This
is...
These
are
m-
these
are
my
thoughts.
You're,

Evelyn?
I'm
sorry,
but
I
don't
think
Not
now.
Evelyn!
Max?
There's
no
need
for
this.
Stop
where
you
are!
Put
down
the
gun,
Max.

Evelyn,
come
here!
Why
are
you


Shoot
him.

Man:
Don't
move!

Evelyn!
Evelyn,
come
here!
Evelyn,
come
with
us!
Bree:
Let's
go.
Let's
go!

We
gotta
get
back


There
are
active

This
has
gone
too
far,
will.

There's
no
way
"They"
are
people.



We're
not
connected
Fire.

Martin
has
my
source
code.

They'll
use
it
What
are
we
doing,
will?
We
can't
fight
them.

We're
not
gonna
fight
them.

We're
gonna
transcend
them.

Evelyn.
What
is
this?

It's
what
I
wanted
you
to
see.

It's
regeneration.

It's
evolution.

Where
are
you
going?
It's
not
safe
here.

I
can
upload
you.

I
can
protect
you
from
them.
I'm
not
afraid
of
them.

Don't
leave,
Evelyn.

We
can
be
together.

Doctor:
We're
losing
him.
Hey!
If
you
don't
connect
me,
I
can't.
It's
not
stopping.
Woman:
Pulse
is
dropping.


Bob:
Where
is
she?
Young
woman:
What
the
hell's
that?



No.
I
know
you're
angry,
Where's
Martin?
I
want
to
talk
to
Martin.
The
real
Martin
What's
left
of
him
What
did
you,
We
gave
him
back
What
did
you
do,
Take
it
easy!
Get
off
me!
He
trusted
you.
We're
just
No.
You
attacked
us.
Max:
Evelyn...
Let
me
show
you
something.
It's
rainwater.
It's
in
the
rain.
Keep
watching.
Everywhere
it
can,
The
particles
which
carry
them
all
over
It's
in
the
sky.
It's
in
the
land.
In
the
water.
By
next
summer,
we
think
the
machine
could
have
Why?
The
end
of
primitive
And
the
dawn
Everything
would
exist
just
No.
Will
wouldn't
do
that.
No.
He
wouldn't.
When
did

You
were
the
one
who
wanted

thing...
It's

never
believed

Any
part

I
spent
my
life
to
a
series
I
failed.
Human
emotion...
It
can
contain
Can

And

Can
you?
Yes.
Does
the
virus
work?
Max:
it'll
wipe
out

So
the
power

Jim:

Buchanan:

past

We
inject
the

and
then
I
go
back
There's
a
chance

won't
detect
As
soon
as
the
nanites

start
to
alter
So
when

It
could
kill
her,
too.
Evelyn:
I
know.
I'm
the
only
one
he
trusts.

Hustle
up!

You
gotta
go.


What
is
that?
Is
that
him?
No,
I...
I
don't
know
what
it's
done,
It
can't
be.
Found
a
way
back.

going

No.
I'm

not
safe

You
can,
If
you

me.
You
can
protect
me.
Your
heart
You're
perspiring.
You're
terrified
of
me.

No,
I'm
afraid
that

isn't
working.
It's
'cause

all
we
need.
Wait.
Wait

The
more
danger
she's
in,
Joseph.
Joseph:
No,
not
to
this
she
didn't.
Give
her
a
chance.
I'm
sorry,
Max.
Fire!
Will,
please
upload
me!
Why
did
you
lose
faith,
Why
didn't
you
Man:
Fire!
Will!
Fire!
Will!
Stephens:
She's
hit!
Clear!
Hey!
She's
been

bad.

You
want
to
destroy

Evelyn:
No,

You're
destroying

I
miss

so

No.
I'm
trying
to
save
them.

Run!

Stop!

You
okay?
Yeah.

He
didn't
kill
anyone.
Will.
It
is
you.
Always
was.
I'm
sorry
Think
about
the

Think
about

I'll
never

you
go.

Max:
The

A

blackout,
But
I
knew
There
had
to
be.
He
created
this

reason
So
that
