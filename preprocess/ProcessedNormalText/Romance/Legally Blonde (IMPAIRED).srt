I
love
that
restaurant!

I
heard
Madonna
went
into
labor
there.
Oh,
gosh!
I
have
to
go
shopping!
Oh,
gosh!
I
have
to
go
shopping!
OK.
I'll
see
you
tonight.
Bruiser,
what's
this?
"Good
luck
tonight.
Oh,
that's
so
cute.
Oh,
my
gosh!
But
I'm
not
positive
Hello!
He
just
had
lunch
You
know
he
got
the
rock.
Why
else
would

have
flown
in

she'd

Ex
Do
you
really
think?
I
can't
believe
Oh,
my
gosh...
you
guys
have
to
help
me
Come
on!
I
think
you
should
go
It's
the
color
of
confidence.
I
don't
understand
your
signature
color.
He's
proposing.
I
can't
look
This
is
THE
date--
I
want
to
look
special.
Bridal.
But
not
like
I
expect
anything.
There's
nothing
I
love
more...
than
a
dumb
blonde
Did
you
see
this
one?
Is
this
low-viscosity
rayon?
Yes.
Of
course.
With
a
half-loop
Absolutely.
It's
one
of
a
kind.
It's
impossible
to
use
on
low-viscosity
rayon.
And
you
didn't
just
get
it
in.
I
saw
it
in
the
June
Vogue
So
if
you're
trying
to
sell
it
you
picked
the
wrong
girl.
Girls,
this
is
it.
In
a
few
hours...
I'll
be
the
future
Hello.
Wow.
You
look
so
beautiful.
So
do
you.
Let's
get
out
of
here.
Must
be
strange
God,
you're
so
wonderful.
Here's
to
us.
To
us.
-
Elle?
One
of
the
reasons
I
wanted
was
to
discuss
our
future.
And
I
am
fully
amenable
Good.
Well,
you
know
how
all
kinds
of
fun
lately?
Well,
Harvard
Law
school
is
and
I
need
to
be
serious.
Of
course.
I
mean,
my
family
expects
a
lot
from
me.
-
Right.
I
plan
on
running
And
I
fully
support
that,
Warner.
Absolutely.
if
I'm
going
to
be
a
senator
I
need
to
stop
dicking
around.
Warner,
I
completely
agree.
Well
that's
why
I
think
-
Elle,
pooh
bear...
-
I
do.
What?
I've
been
thinking
about
it,
You're
breaking
up
with
me?
I
thought
you
were
proposing.
Proposing?
Elle,
if
I'm
going
to
be
Well
I
need
to
marry
a
Jackie,
So
you're
breaking
up
with
me
No.
That's
not
entirely
true.
Then
what?
Elle,
your
boobs
are
fine.
So
when
you
said
you
were
just...
dicking
around?
Elle,
I,
I--
I
do
love
you.
I
just
can't
marry
you.
You
have
no
idea
My
family
has
My
brother's
in
the
top
three
And
he
just
got
engaged
to
Bad
salad.
Sweetie...
Pooh
bear?
It's
not
like
I
have
a
choice
OK,
you
get
the
car,
I
won't
be
having
salad.
Come
on,
let
me
take
you
home.
No!
Elle,
believe
me.
but
I
think
How
can
it
be
the
right
thing
Well,
I
have
to
think
of
my
future...
and
what
my
family
expects
So
you're
breaking
up
with
me...
because
you're
afraid
Everybody
likes
me.
Well,
East
Coast
people
are
different.
What,
just
because
I'm
not
a
Vanderbilt,
I
grew
up
in
Bel
Air,
Warner!
Across
the
street
I
think
most
people
would
agree
than
some
stinky
old
Vanderbilt!
I
told
you.
But
I'm
seriously
in
love
Isn't
that
enough?
Pooh
bear,
just
get
in
the
car.
No.
You're
gonna
ruin
your
shoes.
OK.
Morning,
Amy.
Elle,
it's
Amy.
I'm--
I'm
having
trouble
-
Sweetie,
didn't
you
hear?
It's
terrible.
Why
me?
Because
you're
not
gonna
Oh,
you're
wrong.
I
will
remember,
no
matter
what.
And
I'm
never
gonna
lose
you
You
couldn't.
You're
a
part
of
me.
I
love
you.
Liar!
Honey,
It's
been,
like,
a
week.

So?
What's
the
one
thing
that
always
makes
us

matter
what?
She
had
eight
She
stuffed
them
It
was
so
sad.
We
all
thought
she'd
be
the

now
she's
totally
adrift.
Totally.
She
hasn't

Maybe
she's

is?
Excuse
me.
Are
you
OK?
Do
they

Yes.
I

her.
What
the

do
you
mean
I
went
to
get
her
alibi.
Did
you
get
it?
It's
really
good.
Great.
What
is
it?
Oh,
I
can't
tell
you.
Why
the
hell
not?
Because
I
promised
her
and
I
can't
break
the
bonds
Screw
sisterhood!
not
some
scandal
I
want
the
alibi!
I
can't
give
it
to
you...
but
I
can
tell
you

I
gave
her
my

Warner.
So
what?
The
ex-wife
seems
with
the
fact
She's
at
a

A
spa?
Isn't
that
I
could
go
if
you
want
me
to.
Emmett?
Go
with
her.
She
seems
completely
Why?
I
mean,
this
is
a

telling
women
Brooke
would
never
tell
And,
she
seems
to
me
like
But
maybe
it's
not
what
you
think.
Maybe
it's
exactly
what
I
think.
You're
really
being
a
butthead.
A
butthead?
Why
would
you
call
me
that?
You

you
just

to
have
You
might
be
surprised.
I
can't

So
this
is
what

How
do
we
find
her?
I
called
ahead.
She's

you
found
me.

it
wasn't

Why
do
you

that?
Well...
haven't
you
seen
She's
lying.

right.
How
do
you
think
I'm
not
sure
-
Good
night.
So,
I
called

heard.
I
was
thinking
maybe
No.
You're
a
dork.
I'm
in
law
school.
Look,
I'm
not
going
out
I
can't

you'd
even
ask.

like
me
don't
go
out
Let's
get
out
of
here.
Excuse
me.
Why
didn't
you
call
me?
What?
We
spent
a
beautiful
and
I
never
hear
from
you
again?
I...
I'm
sorry?
Sorry
for
what?
or
for
giving
me

ever
known
and
then
Both?
Well,
forget
it.
I've
already
spent
too
many
hours
So...
when

Yeah.
Here,
take
it.
I've
read
it
20
times.
You
know,
Elle,
you
didn't
tell
It's
not
my

to
tell.
I
know.
And
I
thought
Really?
Sure.

Maybe
you
should

Then
we
can
win
the
case.
I'm
quitting.
Why?
Law
school
was
a
mistake.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
didn't

anything,
Emmett.
Callahan

I
was
just
kidding
myself.

never
saw
me
just
as

Fine.
Is

That's
not
