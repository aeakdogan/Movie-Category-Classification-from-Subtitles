I'm
a
friend
of
Daisy!
Yes!
I'm
in
the
wardrobe!
Is
somebody
looking
for
me?
Benjamin!
-Hi.
-What
are
you
doing
here?
Spend
some
time
I
wish
you
would
have
called.
-Are
you
still
mad?
I
couldn't
take
I
thought
you
were
mesmerizing.
Thank
you.
That's
very
I
better
get
changed.

Would
you
wanna
come?
Somebody
told
me
about
a
restaurant
I
made
a
reservation.
It's
just
that
all
the
dancers
You're
welcome
to
come
with
us.
This
is
David.
This
is
Benjamin.
Oh
yeah...
how
are
you
doing?
I'll
go
get
you
a
drink.
So,
you
were
a
friend
Or
something
like
that?
-Something
like
that.
Hey!
I
had
no
idea
you
were
coming!
Lord,
Benjamin...
What
did
you
expect?
What,
you
want
me
to
drop
Hey,
going
downtown?
Come

You
don't

you
-Daisy,
come
on!
He
seems
nice.
I
think
so.
I'm
happy
for
you.
Maybe
I'll
see
you
at
home.
Okay.
I
enjoyed
the
show!
He
came
to
tell
me
You
couldn't
have
known.
I
was
23.
I
just
didn't
care.
What
did
you
do
next?
Front
of
my
bag.
I
was
as
good
a
dancer
For
five
years...
I
danced
everywhere.
London,
Vienna,
Prague...
I've
never
seen
these.
Mom,
you
never
talked
I
was
the
only
American
to
dance
with
the
Bolshoi.
It
was
glorious.
But
Benjamin
was
never
And
I'd
find
myself
saying:
Goodnight,
Benjamin.
-"Goodnight,
Daisy."
Life
wasn't
all
that
complicated.
If
you
want,
you
might
say
Benjamin,
mrs
La

Mr
Benjamin
Button?
Bonjour.
Miss
Daisy
Fuller.
Please,
have
a
seat.
Sometimes
we
are
on
a
collision
Whether
it's
by
accident
there's
not
a

A
woman
in
Paris
was
on
But
she
had
forgotten
her
coat,
When
she
had
gotten
her
so
she
had
stopped
to
answer
it
While
the
woman
was
Daisy
was
rehearsing
for
performance
And
while
she
was
rehearsing,
had
gone
outside
to
get
a
taxi.
Now
a
taxi
driver
had
and
had
stopped
to
And
all
the
while
And
this
cab
driver
who
had

had
stopped

picked
up
the
lady
who
had
missed

had
to
stop
for
a
man
who
had
left
for

minutes
because
he

the
woman
to
pick
up
a
package
because
the

who
had
broken
up
with
her
boyfriend
When
the
package
was
wrapped,
was
blocked
by
a
delivery
truck.
All
the
while
Daisy
The
delivery
truck
pulled
away
While
Daisy,
waited
for
one
of
her
friends
While
the
taxi
was
stopped,
Daisy
and
her
friend
came
out
And
if
only
one
thing
if
that
shoelace
hadn't
broken,
or
that
delivery
truck
had
or
that
package
had
been
because
the
girl
hadn't

that
man
had
set
his
alarm
or
that

driver
hadn't

that
woman
had
and
had
gotten

her
friend

And
the
taxi
would
But
life
being
what
it
is,
a
series
of
intersecting

of
anyone's
control,
that
taxi
did
not
go
by,
and
that
driver
was
And
that
taxi
hit
Daisy.
And
her
leg
was
crushed.
Daisy...
-Who
told
you?
Very
kind
of
you
to
come

this
You'd
do
the
same
for
me.
My

Look
at
you.
I
wish
you
hadn't
come.
I
don't

Don't
you
