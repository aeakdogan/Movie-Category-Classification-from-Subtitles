TUS:
Long
ago,
in
a
land
far
away,
there
once
rose
an
empire
that
to
the
shores
of
the
Mediterranean.
That
empire
was
Persia.
Fierce
in
battle,
wise
in
victory,
where
the
Persian
sword
went,
The
Persian
king,
Sharaman,
upon
the
principles
of
loyalty
The
King
had
two
sons
Rejoice!
But
in
the
eyes
of
the
gods,
the
King's
family
was
not
yet
complete,
not
until
the
day
he
witnessed
by
an
orphan
boy
PERSIAN
CAPTAIN:
Get
out
of
the
way!


Stop!
DASTAN:
Stop!

Run!
Run,
Bis!
Run!
Stay
here.



SOLDIER:
Stop
him!
He's
getting
away!
DASTAN:
Let
go
of
me!
Come
here!

In
the
King's
name!
What
is
your
name,
boy?
-
Dastan,
sire.
Boy!
Brother,
take
him
up.
TUS:
Moved
by
what
he
saw,
the
King
adopted
the
boy,
Dastan,
A
son
with
no
royal
blood
and
no
eye
on
his
throne.
But
perhaps
there
was
something
beyond
the
day
a
boy
a
prince
of
Persia.
The
fabled
Alamut.
Don't
be
fooled
by
beauty,
Prince
Tus.
Soft
countries
make
soft
men.
They
stoop
to
treachery
My
father's
made
clear
-
Some
consider
it
sacred.
But
since
our
wise
father
isn't
here,
I'll
have
one
last
council
and
my
two
brothers,
Where's
Dastan?

Come
on!
I
bet
my
entire
This
is
embarrassing!
-
Why
don't
you
give
it
a
try?
Is
that
all
you
got?
Prince
Dastan!

Where
is
Prince
Dastan?

Prince
Dastan
isn't
here!
-

Prince
Tus
has
convened
a
war
council.
I'm
on
my
way.
Our
finest
spy
intercepted
a
caravan
Swords
of
the
best
workmanship.
Steel-tipped
arrows.
And
promise
of
payment
They're
selling
weapons
An
arrow
such
as
this
Blood
will
run
Or
our
soldiers
will
fall
from
its
walls.
Our
orders
were
to
subdue
Koshkhan,
Wise
words,
little
brother.
Words
won't
stop
our
enemies
once
they're
armed

We
attack
at
dawn.
Well,
if
that's
your
decision,

Thoughts
to
share,
Garsiv?
I
ride
at
the
head
of
the
Persian
army.
Dastan
leads
a
company
They
may
not
be
much
for
manners,
The
honour
of
first
blood
Garsiv,
your
hand
is
-
Where
it
should
be!

Ever
eager.
It's
said
the
princess
of
Alamut
We'll
march
into
her
palace


There
can
be
no
doubt
But
you're
not
ready
for
this.
Garsiv's
cavalry
will
lead
the
way.
REGENT:
Princess
Tamina.
The
Persian
army,
my
princess,
Their
faith
has
little
love
for
any
truth
other
than
its
own.
-

if
you
didn't
stand
so
close.
Whatever
their
faith,
Nor
is
their
aim.
Gather
the
council.
Tell
them
I
sit
in
the
High
Temple.
REGENT:
The
High
Temple?
Alamut
hasn't
been
breached
Everything
changes
with
time.
We
should
know
this
best
of
all.
BIS:
Remind
me
why
we're
disobeying
DASTAN:
Because
Garsiv
only
knows
It'll
be
a
massacre.
The
Alamutians
will
be
busy
so
we'll
slip
through
the
side.

Have
you
been
drinking?

That's
our
way
in.
There
are
two
gates.
It's
the
inner
gate
that's
impossible.
That
gate
mechanism
is
protected
Yeah,
well,
there's
always
a
way
in,
Bis.
You
take
care
of
the
outer
gate,
you
leave
the
impossible
one
to
me.
You
know,
sire,
you
won't
be
happy
Ooh!
Wonderful
speech,
Bis.
Rousing.

Sound
the
alarm!



Hold
this.


-
Watch
your
back.
PERSIAN
OFFICER:
That's
Dastan's
man.
Redeploy
to
the
eastern
gate.

Redeploy
to
the
eastern
gate!

Come
on.

ASOKA:
Above
all
else,
ASOKA:
Out
of
the

Silly
songs
and
scented
smoke
I
think
you'll
find
there's
more

So
for
once
the
stories
are
true.

We
know

Now
show
us
where.
And
what

Our

You

a

will
not

Spoken
like
one
wise
enough
Join
hands
with
Persia's
future

I'll

first.


That
can
be

TAMINA:
Don't!

SOLDIER
1:
Hey,
the
Lion
of
Persia!
They're
calling
you
the
Lion
of
Persia.
You've
never
excelled
-
I
have
some
explaining
to
do,
Tus.
I...
No.

No!
We
have
some
celebrating
to
do.
There
is,
however,
tradition.
Since
you
took
the
honour
you
owe
me
a
gift
of
homage.
A
beautiful
dagger.
He
delivered
you
the
city
-
I
think
that's
homage
enough.
First
dispatch
has
just
arrived,
Wonderful
news.
Your
father
has
interrupted
his
prayers
No
doubt
to
commend
us

TUS:
We
had
indications
Indications?
You
better
have
more
than
indications
to
occupy
a
holy
city
with
my
troops!
This

adventure
won't
sit
with
our
allies.
Oh,
but
I
suppose
Don't
look
to
your
uncle,
boy.
The
decision,
and
its
consequences,


I
know
you're
eager
to
wear
the
crown,
but
trust
me
when
I
tell
you
No
man
would
know
Because
your
trust
is
something
I
will
oversee
the
search
I
vow
I
will
not
stand
before
you

-

The
third
step
is
the
hardest!
Brother!
Brother!
We've
uncovered
signs
of
tunnels
-
Oh!
Oh,
but
you'll
miss
the
banquet!
You
and
Garsiv
can
handle
Father
-
You
do
have
a
gift
to
honour
him
with?
-
Bis,
gift!
It's
been
momentarily
misplaced.
I
knew
you'd
forget.
The
holiest
in
the
eastern
lands.
You
fought
like
a
champion
for
me,
A
rare
jewel.
Present
her
to
the
King
for
me
Sure
you
really
want
Listen
to
me,
Dastan.
A
marriage
to
the
Princess
assures
me
Unbound
to
us,
If
Father
doesn't
approve
our
union,
I
want
you
to
end
her
life
So,
I'm
escorted
by
Prince
Dastan,
-
the
Lion
of
Persia.
Must
feel
wonderful
for
destroying
such
an
innocent
city.
Ah!
A
pleasure
to
meet
you,
too,
And
allow
me
to
offer
that
if
punishing
then
it's
one
I'll
gladly
repeat.
Then
you
are
a
true
prince
of
Persia.
Brutal,
without
honour.
Don't
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
Oh!
And
what
more
is
there?
Wait
here
with
Her
Highness.
If
you
can
manage
it,
I
suggest
a
hint
of
humility
For
your
own
good.

You've
eased
Father's
anger,
Uncle.
One
day,
you'll
have
the
pleasure
As
long
as
you
remember
your
most
Oh?
And
what's
that?
Making
sure
his
wine
glass
stays
full.
I'm
told
that
another
of
my
sons
of
great
Persian
warriors.

We
missed
you,
Father.
I
was
praying
for
you
Family.
The
bond
between
brothers,
that
defends
our
empire.
And
I
pray
that
I
was
hoping
my
actions
would
spare
A
good
man
would've
done
acting
boldly
and
courageously
But
a
great
man
from
happening
at
all.
A
great
man
would've
stopped
no
matter
who
was
ordering
it.
The
boy
I
saw
in
that
square
was
capable
of
being
but
of
being
great.
Well,
in
the
meantime,

SHARAMAN:
Some
questioned
from
the
streets
into
my
family.
I
saw
a
boy
whose
blood
wasn't
noble,
but
whose
character
was.
A
king
in
spirit.

Thank
you,
Father.
Thank
you,
Father.
May
I
present

What
can
I
grant
you
in
return?
Roham!
May
I
present
Princess
Tamina.
Tus
wishes
to
make
a
union
It
is
my
deepest
wish
In
all
of
my
travels,
I
have
never
looked
upon
You
should
have
seen
it
before
descended
upon
it.

Clearly
she
will
make
a
fine
queen.

But
Tus
already
has
enough
wives.
You,
Dastan,
might
take
fewer
chances
if
such
a
jewel
waited
in
your
chambers.
The
Princess
of
Alamut

What
say
you,
Dastan?
Uh...
He
plunges
into
a
hundred
foes
but
before
marriage
And
there
are
those
-



GARSIV:
Stand
aside!
Out
of
my
way!

Father.
NIZAM:
God
help
us!
Somebody
help
him!
-
The
robe
Dastan
gave
him!
-
Somebody
help
him!
-
Somebody
help
him!
GARSIV:
Seize
him!
Move!

Bis!


Bis!
Come
with
me!



-
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
You're
going
to
need
my
help.

Come
on!
-
Close
the
gate!


Close
the
gate!
DASTAN:
Get
down!
There!
After
the
murderer!
He's
on
my
horse!
He
stole
my
horse!

Aksh,
come
on!
TUS:
My
loyal
subjects,
the
whole
world
grieves
at
the
death
We
are
all
stricken
by
his
loss.
That
the
murder
came
only
makes
our
pain
worse.
I
didn't
murder
my
father.
That
robe
was
given
to
me
Tus
did
this.
And
now
he
stands
to
be
crowned
king.
I
didn't
kill
my
father.
I
believe
you.
You
shouldn't
be
here.
But
you
did.
I
promised
my
brother
I'd
kill
you

Well,
the
solution
would
be
to
kiss
me
and
then
kill
me.


I
kill
you,
and
your
problems
are
solved!
Perhaps
we
can
find
another
solution.




Well,
the
solution
would
be
to
kiss
me,
But
I
have
a
better
solution.
-
No.
-

Give
back
what
you
stole,
Persian!
Don't!
-
Did
you
see
that?
Go
for
that
sword
again,
Again?
You've
used
up
all
the
sand!
-
What?
What
is
this?

Incredible.
Releasing
the
sand
turns
back
time.
And
only
the
holder
of
the
dagger
He
can
go
back
and
alter
events,
and
no
one
knows
but
him.
How
much
can
it
unwind?
-
Answer
me,
Princess.
Our
invasion
wasn't
It
was
about
this
dagger.
After
the
battle,
I
didn't
think
anything
of
it,
With
it
he
could
change
anything.
He
could
change
the
course
He
could
foresee
the
blade
of
a
rival.
He
wouldn't
just
be
king,
he'd
be
the
Greater
even
than
my
father.
It
was
all
about
this
dagger!
TUS:
My
treacherous
brother
and
as
such,
I
have
doubled
Meanwhile,
I
shall
strive
as
my
father
would
have
demanded.
A
new
reign
has
begun.
-
TAMINA:
What
are
you
doing?
And
Aksh
is
the
most
famous
horse
-
This
will
obscure
his
tracks.
To
Avrat,
where
my
father
will
be
buried.

wanted
for
the
King's
murder
and
you're
going
to
alongside
thousands

Nizam
will
be
there.
He'll
see

was
set
up
by
Tus.
Step
aside,
Princess.
Every
road
to
Avrat
will
be
covered
I'm
not
taking
roads.
I'm
going
No
one
goes
near
that
wasteland.
It's
filled
with
murdering
cutthroats.

So
they
say.
-
Your
whole
plan
is
suicide!
and
left
his
blood
on
my
hands.
then
so
be
it.

So
you're
going
to
leave
me
here
Noble
Dastan,
abandoning
What
does
your
precious
honour

Give
me
the
strength
not
to
kill
her.
Mount
up.
We
can't
be
far
behind
him.

Without
the
right
sand,
Not
even
very
sharp.
This
sand,
is
there
more
of
it?
Of
course
not.
Well,
how
can
I
get
some?
Try
standing
on
your
head
See
what
you
were
looking
for,
Prince?
Start
walking.

If
you
can't
prove
to
your
uncle
why
in
the
world
would
he
believe
you?
It's
not
your
problem,
Princess.
You
know,
you
really
walk
like
one.
Head
held
high,
chest
out,
The
walk
of
a
self-satisfied
No
doubt
it
comes
from
being
told

and
actually
believing
it.
I
wasn't
born
in
a
palace
like
you.
I
was
born
in
the
slums
of
Nasaf,
where
I
lived
if
I
fought
Then
how
did
you
become
a
prince?
The
King
marched
into
the
market
I
don't
know.
He...
He
found
me.
He
took
me
in.
He
gave
me
a
family.
What
you're
looking
at
is
the
walk
of
a
man
DASTAN:
Welcome
to
I'm
desperate
for
a
drop
of
water.
That's
more
than
we
have,
since
you
I
wasn't
born
of
this
desert
all
shrivelled
and
angry.
My
constitution
is
much
more
delicate.
I
think
you
mean
"spoiled."
The
wells
of
Alamut
are
famed
Perhaps
less
time
admiring
your
wells
and
you
wouldn't
be
here.

Ah!
A
miracle!
I've
silenced
the
Princess!
Tamina?
Tamina?
Can
you
hear
me?


Yes,
Dastan,
I
can
hear
you.



MAN:
Do
you
know

And
yet
you
enter
still?
In
the
heart
of

known
as
the
Ngbaka.
They
strike
fear
into
the
hearts
The
Ngbaka
are
masters
Wielding
blades
said
to
have
been
Their
aim
is
so
murderously
accurate
with
one
strike.
Oh,
I
wouldn't
even
bother
doing
that
This
is
Seso.
He's
a
Ngbaka.
I
had
the
good
fortune
of
saving
his
life,
which
means
that
he
is
now
So
tell
me,
Persian,
is
there
any
good
reason
to
put
his
next
throw
just
a
little
higher?




SHEIKH
AMAR:
So!
This
is
the
one,
eh?

Yes!
You
were
right.
Oh!
She
could
smell
a
bit
better,
though.
Still,
we
have
a
deal.

Clever
princess.
Deal?
What
deal?
TAMINA:
Such
a
noble
prince!
How
taken
you
were
eagerly
leaping
to
assist

Who
said
There
must
be
a
reason

I...
I
don't
trust
you.
-
And
you're
not
my
type.
I'm
not

desperate
slave
girl.
I'm
actually
capable
Yeah,
too
many
for
my
taste!
SHEIKH
AMAR:
Oh,
yeah.
What
do
you
intend
to
do
with
her?
Yes,
do
tell
him.

-
Give
me
a
moment.
It's
hard
for
me
to
admit,
but
you
were
right.
I
did
see
what
I
was
looking
for.
Dastan,
listen
to
me.
When
my
uncle
sees
the
power

I
know
I
haven't
been

Oh,
but
your
lies
I
am
the
guardian
of
a
divine
covenant.

That
dagger
is
sacred.
It
was
being
smuggled
to
safety
If
the
dagger
gets
I
will
take
care
of
your
knife.
You
won't
want
to
miss
this.
You
don't
understand
what's
at
stake!
This
is
a
matter
for
the
gods,
not
man!
-
Your
gods,
not
mine.
Come
on!

(ALL
CHATTERING

Ostrich
racing?
Whatever
they
lack
in
beauty,

And
the
races
are
easy
to
fix.
DASTAN:
I've
heard
all
these

The
bloodthirsty
slaves
That's
a
good
story.
Yeah,
but,
alas,
untrue.
But
the
skeletons
that
we
saw
I
bought
those
I
crafted
our
lurid
reputation
in
order
to
fend
off
that's
been
lurking
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about?
Taxes.

And
all
these
Persians
with
their
armies,
their
fortresses,
Who
pays
for
it
all,
eh?
See,
that's
why
I
started
to
spread
some
false
notoriety.
I
spread
it
like
a
venerable
disease

Behold
the
mighty
ostrich!

Come
on,
my
beauty!
Oh,
I
love
this!
And
the
tax
collectors
steer
clear
of
me
Everybody's
happy.
-
Uh...
Get
the
girls
on!
Come
on!

Don't
just
stand
there!
Run,
don't
walk!

If
you
drop
anything,
you
pay
for
it!
Now,
don't
look
at
me
like
that.
Do
your
job!

Thank
you!
You
know,
I
think

little

Don't
touch!

a
lively
one!

Whoa.
Have

told
you
about
the
Ngbaka?
-
Yes,
you
have.
But
yours,
however,
Please!
I
mean,
look
at
her.
And
as
for
you,
young
man,
did
you
know
your
brother's
offered
which,
quite
frankly,
between
you
I'd
trade
in
my
own
mother
What?
You
didn't
know
Take
him
down
to
the
Persian
outpost.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Look.
That...
-
Nice
knife.
It's
nothing.
-
No,
look,
that's
worthless!
Melt
it
down
for
the
jewels.



-
Whoa!
No,
you
might
kill
a
bird!
Hey!
Over
here!

Whoa,
whoa!
Get
to
the
tunnel!
Oh,
look
at
this!
That's
it!
No
more
fermented
goat's
milk
Get
after
him!
Come
on!
-
The
gate!
Stop!
Lift
the
lever!
It'll
open
the
gate!
-
Give
me
the
dagger!
This
is
not
the
time!
Just
lift
that
lever!
Give
me
the
dagger!
-



Don't
think
it
didn't
cross
my
mind.
Move,
Princess!
Persian!
Dastan!

Persian!

Looking
for
this?
Key?
Huh?
Oops!
Next
time,
you!

They've
all
come
for
my
father's
funeral.

TAMINA:
There
are
100
Persian
soldiers
Maybe
more.
you're
going
to
have
All
these
foreign
dignitaries,
I'm
guessing
you
know
a
few.
Couldn't
you
have
found
The
Mughals
of
the
Hindu
Kush
You
should
be
honoured.
Oh,
yes.
Terribly.
Dastan,
where's
the
dagger?
You're
welcome
to
search
me
for
it.
You'll
have
to
be
very
thorough.
Tus
isn't
here.
The
sand
that
fuels
the
dagger,
there's
more
of
it
hidden
That's
why
Tus
stays
there.
That's
what
he's
got
our
army
I
have
to
get
a
message
That's
impossible.
(MAN
SHOUTING
Difficult,
not
impossible.
Or
more
proof
you're
insane.
Then
why
do
you
look
so
impressed?
Out
of
the
way!
Make
way!
-
Oh!
-
Turn
around.
Turn
around!
You
used
to
buy
those
for
me
You
used
to
spit
the
seeds
at
Garsiv.
You
should
not
have
I
had
no
choice,
Uncle.
Follow
me.
I
didn't
kill
Father.
You
know
I
would
never
do
Your
actions
speak
otherwise.
But
I
had
no
choice
but
to
flee.
Tus
gave
me
that
cloak.
-
He
was
the
one
who
poisoned
it.
Well,
he's
not
here,
is
he?
At
his
father's
funeral.
Our
allies
will
see
our
invasion
was
just.
The
search
for
Yes,
but
not
if
there
are
none.
The
invasion
of
Alamut
was
a
lie.
Tus
is
after
power.
And
now
he
searches
not
for
weapons,
but
for
the
sand
This
is
why
you
brought
me
here,
Do
you
remember,
after
the
battle,
you
stopped
Tus
Mmm-hmm.
That
dagger
is
the
reason
This
dagger,
you
have
it
with
you?
Yes.
It
has
incredible
powers.
Is
this
some
sort
of
a
joke,
Dastan?
What?
No,
it
was
in
there.
Then
where's
your
so-called
evidence?
Tamina.
I...

Your
hands
are
burned.
Yes.
From
trying
to
pull
-
Is
something
wrong,
Dastan?
You're
certain?
It's
just
that,
uh,
Tus
is
my
brother.
How
could
he
betray
me
like
this?
I
can't
say,
Dastan.
Perhaps
he
never
respected
you
as
you
deserve,
only
saw
you
as
someone
he
could
use.
Someone
to
keep
his
wine
glass
filled?
My
service
to
your
father
was
different.
We
shared
the
same
blood,
Dastan.
How
many
times
did
Father
speak
-
That
was
his
favourite
story.
-

I'm
afraid
you're
Wait!
Dastan!

Over
here!
GARSIV:
Murderer!
I
didn't
kill
Father!

DASTAN:
Out
of
the
way!
