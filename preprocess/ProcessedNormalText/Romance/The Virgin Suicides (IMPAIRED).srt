Cecilia
was
the
first
to
go.




What
are
you
doing
here,
honey?
You're
not
even
old
enough
Obviously,
Doctor,
Everyone
dates
..from
the
suicides
of
the
Lisbon
girls.
People
saw
their
clairvoyance
in
..and
the
continuing
decline
Even
then,
as
teenagers,
We
still
can't.
Now
whenever
we
run
into
each
other
..we
find
ourselves
going
over
All
to
understand
those
five
girls,...
..who,
after
all
these
years,
Cecilia,
the
youngest,
was
1
3.
And
Lux
was
1
4.
Bonnie
was
1
5.
Mary
was
1
6.
And
Therese
was
1
7.
No
one
could
understand
how
Mrs
Lisbon
..had
produced
such
beautiful
creatures.
Paul
Baldino
claimed
to
have
Hey,
l
was
the
one
who
found
her.
l
was
in
the
storm
sewer
under
my
house.
You
could
get
into
anyone's
house.
When
Paul
said
this,
we
believed
him...
..because
he
was
the
son
..and
we
knew
about
his
escape
tunnel.
So
l
went
up,
thinking
l
could
see
Right!
And
l
walk
in...
..and
l
see
blood
everywhere.
So
l
turned
around,
went
for
the
stairs
l
had
to
tell
you
guys
that
story.
l'll
see
you
guys
later,
all
right?
-

l
heard
there
was
an
accident.
Of
course
the
parents
are
to
blame!
l
heard
they
found
the
razor
in
the
toilet...
Everyone
had
an
opinion
That
girl
didn't
want
to
die.
She
wanted
out
The
most
popular
theory
Dominic
was
staying
with
relatives
He
was
the
first
in
our
neighbourhood
..and
within
a
week
of
his
arrival
The
object
of
his
desire
wasn't
Cecilia,
l
love
her!
When
Diana
Porter
left
on
vacation
To
prove
the
validity
of
his
love...
..he
jumped
off
the
roof
Ahem!
l'm
gonna
..and,
uh...
you
tell
me...
..what
they
remind
you
of.
OK?
A
banana.
A
swamp.
An
Afro.
l
don't
think
Cecilia
Her
act
was
a
cry
for
help.
l
know
you're
very
strict,...
..but
l
think
that
Cecilia
would
benefit
..outside
of
the
codification
of
school,...
..where
she
could
interact
Peter
Sisten
had
helped
Mr
Lisbon
install
And
in
return
Mr
Lisbon
Bless
us,
O
Lord,
and
these
thy
gifts,...
..which
we
are
about
to
receive
from
thy
Amen.
Lux,
please,
put
your
shirt
on
this
instant.

Sorry.
-
Thank
you,
dear.
-
Ham?
-
Sweetheart,
would
you
like
some
peas?
Here.

That's
a
nice-looking
ham,
dear.
-
Well,
thank
you,
honey.
So,
Peter,
are
you
an
aviation
enthusiast?
Well,
l
don't
know
if
l'd
call
myself
Ah.
Uh,
Peter,
are
you
on
the
football
squad?
Um,
no,
l
play
it,
-
Oh,
l
see.
Do
you
like
to
wrestle?
-

The
Brazilian
turbot
frog
was
added
to
-
That's
the
third
animal
this
year.
The
turbot
frog?
Um,
excuse
me,
may
l
use
the
rest
room?
Oh,
of
course.
The
one
down
here
-
Go
upstairs
through
Cecilia's
room.
-


l
thought
you'd
died
in
there.
Are
you
done
hogging
the
bathroom?
Do
you
mind?

-
Thank
you
very
much.
Oh,
Peter.
Here's
a
little
aerofoil
lt's
a...
..demonstration
of
From
that
time
on,
Almost
every
day,...
..and
even
when
..Lux
would
suntan
wearing
a
swimsuit...
..that
caused
the
knife
sharpener
to
give
Following
the
doctor's
orders,

their
short
lives.

So

How

Afraid

the
weather.

She's

anybody.
Well,

see
her
priest.
Ah!
This
kid's
a
sucker
Every
time.
Excuse

Father.
Ah!
Double
play...
Father.
Double
play.
Mrs
Lisbon?

-
May
l
come
in?
Hello,
girls.
l
thought
we
could
talk.
Do
you
feel
like
talking?
Well,
if
you
ever
want
to,
Mrs
Lisbon,
it's
Father
Moody.
Mrs
Lisbon,
hello.
l
wanted
you
to
know
that
An
accident
waiting
to
happen.
John
said
l
know.
lt's
so
incredibly
dangerous.
Let's
give
it
a
try.
Ready?
One,
two,
three.

Oh,
God.
lt's
just
so
sad.
Footings
are
too
deep.
Got
that
chain
in
your
truck?

Hit
it!
Our
collection
of
souvenirs
..started
with
Cecilia's
diary.
Parkie
had
gotten
it
from
Skip
Ortega,
..who
had
found
it
next
to
the
toilet.
Tim
Weiner
-
''the
Brain''
-
decoded
it.
Emotional
instability.
Look
at
the
i's.
Basically,...
..what
we
have
here
is
a
dreamer.
Someone
completely
When
she
jumped,
''Monday,
February
1
3th.
''Thursday.
Mom
made
creamed
corn
for
''Mary
chipped
her
front
tooth
''She
made
a
big
scene
and
had
to
Here,
give
me
that.
Told
you
she
had
a
capped
tooth.
Elm
trees.
How
many
pages
Here,
something
about
Dominic.
''Palazzolo
jumped
off
the
roof
''How
stupid
can
you
be?''
''Today
we
went
out
on
the
boat.
''We
saw
a
couple
of
whales.''
''Lux
stroked
the
whale.
''lt's
the
kelp
in
their
baleens
rotting.''
''l
hope
we
can
go
again
sometime.''
Let's
read
that.
''Lux
lost
it
over
Kevin...''
-
ls
it
Heines?

Lux
lost
it
over
Kevin
Haines,
She'd
wake
up
at
five
in
the
morning
..like
it
wasn't
completely
obvious.
She
wrote
his
name
in
marker
Mom
found
them
Lux
was
crying
on
her
bed
all
day.
The
trees
like
lungs
filling
with
air.
My
sister,
the
mean
one,
pulling
my
hair.

And
so
we
started
..coming
to
hold
collective
memories
We
felt
the
imprisonment
of
being
a
girl,
..so
you
ended
up
knowing
We
knew
the
girls
..that
they
understood
love
..and
that
our
job
was
merely
to
create
We
knew
that
they
knew
And
that
we
couldn't
fathom
them
at
all.
Hi.
Uh,
Mrs
Lisbon,

Hi,

is

here
to
ask
you
Yeah?
Great,
great.
Um,
maybe
you
could
start
Did
she
have
any
-
Um,
she
liked
writing
in
her
journal
a
lot.
Um,
OK.
Uh,
did
she...
Did
she
ever
talk
about
ending
her
life?
What's
going
on
here?
Um,
you
must
be
Mrs
Lisbon.

Lydia

from
Channel
2,
and...
You
have
to
leave
now,
Miss
Perl.
The
suicide
of
an
East
Side
teenager
..has
increased
the
awareness
l'm
in
front
of
the
home
Why
can't
they
let
her
rest
in
peace?
..and
write
poetry,
Psychologists
agree
that
adolescence
..by
pressures
and
complexities
More
and
more
doctors
say
this

reality

full
of

poison.
l
thought
l
could
eat
it,
you
know,
My
nana,
who
is
86...
She
really
liked
sweets.
She
had
three
pieces.

l
feel
sorriest
for
the
mother.

You'd
always
wonder
if
-
l
gotta
go.
See
you
later.
Bye-bye.


Don't
worry.
They
took
the
fence
out.

God,
you
snore
loud.

Those
girls
have
a
bright
future
The
other
one
We
didn't
see
the
girls
together
as
Mary,
Lux,
Bonnie
and
Therese
came
to
We
felt
if
we
looked
hard
enough,...
..we
might
begin
to
understand
what
All
right,
so
if
we
have
-
these
are
lf
we
have
A
and
B
intersecting,...
..and
A
and
B...
lf
A
intersects
B,
we
have
this
area.
And
if
A
is
the
union
with
B,
we
have
These
are

laws

How's
it
going?
Not
bad.
''Do
a

the
following
The
first
one

Ralph.
Um,
he
was
nice.
lt
was
really
sad
when
he
died.
Oh,
my
gosh.
l
am
so
sorry.
Reading
about
..l
talked
to
Mr
Woodhouse
..and
realised
that
nothing
..has
been
discussed
at
this
school.
Quickly
thereafter

We
thought
green
was
cheerful,
Certainly
better
than
red.
They
told
us
there
were
-
..30,000
a
year,...
..and
alerted
us
to
danger
signals
Were
the
Lisbon
girls'
pupils
dilated?
Had
they
lost
interest
in
school
activities,
Had
they
withdrawn
from
their
peers?
Hi.
l'm
Chase.
l
know
who
you
are.
l've
only
been
going
to
this
school
You
don't
have
to
talk
to
me.

For
example,
we
have
..or
so-called
two
different
types.
Look.
She's
laughing.
He
made
her
laugh!
l've
never
heard
him
The
boys
who
talked
with
Lux
..and
made
terrible
Squeezebox
is
all
right.
Let
me
tell
you,
she's
the
hottest
girl
Do
you
wanna
know
what
happened?
Nah,
she
didn't
talk
about
Cecilia.
We
weren't
exactly
talking,
But
the
only
reliable
boy
..was
Trip
Fontaine,
who
only
..had
emerged
from
baby
fat

late
again.
Oh,

on.
Thank
you.

A
cold
late
night,
so
long
ago

When
l
was
not
so
strong,
you
know

A
pretty
man
came
to
me

Never
seen
eyes
so
blue,
you
know

l
could
not
run
away
it
seemed

We'd

each

dream

seemed

He
looked
right
through
me,

Come
on
home,
girl

You
don't
have
to
love
me

awhile

All
the
girls
at

school
All
the
girls
except
for
Lux.
Trip
told
us
his
passion
for
Lux
started...
..when
he
went
into
the
wrong
He
went
out
to
his
car
..as
regularly
as
Peter
Petrovich,
On
this
particular
day
..and
ducked
into
the
nearest
class.

She
was
the
still
point
l
never
got
over
that
girl.
Never.
l
mean...
you
know,
That
was
real.
l'll
never
forget
the
first
time
l
saw
her.
l
didn't
know
what
to
do...
..cos
it
was
so
easy
..but
she
wouldn't
look
at
me.
l,
uh...
l
was
never
the
kind
to
pursue,
That
girl
drove
me
crazy,
man.
Mm,
yummy.
Warm.
Lux.
Hey.

Look
at
it.

just
meat
on

the
older
girls.
Even
if
l
wanted
to,
True.
So,
uh...
lf
you
want
to
come
over
and
..but
you
cannot
take
Lux
out,
So
l'm
sorry,
son,
that's
just
our
policy.
OK,
sir,
what
if
there
was
..and
we
took
..and
we
had
'em
back
-
Are
you
on
the
football
squad,
son?
-
Ah.
What
position?
Ah.
Good.
Good.
l
was
a...

That's
a
crucial
position,
sir.
-
Exactly!
Exactly.
Oh,
well...
So
the
thing
is,
sir,
we've
got
..then
afterwards
we
have
the
dance
and...
You're
a
good-looking
fellow,
Trip.
Yeah,
well,
l'm
not
interested
l'll
take
it
up
with
the
wife,
Trip.
Thank
you,
sir.
-
lt's
a
graph.
Mm.
Trip
Fontaine
and
some
of
the...
..other
boys
in
the
football
squad
asked
to
You
know
how
l
feel
-
l'm
gonna
be
a
chaperon
at
the
dance.
Your
father
and
l
will
discuss
it
later.
Mr
Fontaine,
Now,
my
wife
and
l
have
had
a
little
talk...
..and
we've
come
to
a
decision
Yes!
-

-
l
need
three
guys
to
take
the
other
girls.
l'll
give
you
three
joints,
Trip.
Come
on,
Trip,
man.
You
pick
me,
You
gotta
pick
me,
Tripster!
Trip,
man,
you
owe
me.
l
saved
your
ass
-

Thanks,
Dad!
-
Who
are
the
other
boys?
Parker
Denton
and
Jake
Conley.
And,
uh...
Kevin
Head.
-
Who's
taking
who?
They're
just
gonna
raffle
us
off.
lt
made
no
difference
which
pattern
Mrs
Lisbon

an
inch
to
the
And
the
dresses
came
out
-
Everybody
decent?
OK.
Come
on.
Oh,
l'm
sorry.
OK,
there
we

-
There's
a
leak.
l'm
so
excited!
-
You
ready?
-
Ready,
man.
ln
the
end
Parkie

because
..and
Joe
Hill

..which
Trip
thought
-
Hello,
boys.
Come
in.

Thank
you.
-
Uh,
who...
who...
who's
driving?
How
long
have
you
had
your
licence?
Two
months,
but

almost
never

girls
There's
so
many
accidents
nowadays.
-
Oh,
yes,
ma'am.
Girls!
-
l
better
get
going.
See
you
at
the
dance.
Bye,
dear.
See
you
later.
Girls,
come
on
down.
The
boys
are
here.

We
got
white
ones.
We
didn't
know
what
you
were
wearing,
..that
white
would
go
with
anything,
so...
l'm
glad
you
got
white.

Why
don't
you
pin
them
on?


Don't
stick
me!
There
we
go.
All
right.
Let's
do
it.
Bye,
Mom.
Bye.
Oh
my
gosh,
look,
you
guys.
Mr
Leo's
having
an
affair
with
the
maid.
l
saw
him
follow
her
-
Eugh!
He's
so
fat,
and
that
red
nose.
What
about
the
Hessens?
They're
Nazi
sympathisers,
Bonnie.
They
had
a
fit
when
the

Kriegers

it's

Leads
to
a
river
where
he
has
his
boat.
He
can
get
into
anyone's
basement
-
No
way.
Cool.
-

Dad'll
smell
it
on
you.
He'll
smell
it
on
your
clothes.
l'll
just
tell
him
some
kids
Don't
let
it
die
a
virgin.
-
That's
gross!

everyone.

you're
all
having
a
good
time.
Here's
a
spot.
l'd
like
to
open
the
voting
The
ballot
box
is
at
the
refreshments
..and
we'll
make
the
announcement

Did
anybody
see
you

in?
No.

What
about
you?
You'll
love
it.

Peach
schnapps.
Babes
love

So
don't

it

lt's
just

phase

going
through

any,

Come
on,
just
a
taste.
A
tiny
taste.

Don't
be
such
a
goody-goody.
Don't
swallow
it!

like
to
see
you

But
then
again

That
doesn't

No,
no

because

Can

have
everyone's
attention,
please?
l'd
like
you
all
to
put
your
hands
together
..
Trip
Fontaine
and
Lux
Lisbon.



All
right,
Luxie!
*
But
we'll
try
the
best
that
we
can
*
To
carry
on
*
The
Reno
angels

Beat
above
my
head
*
They
sang
to
me
this
song

the
best
time!

Let's
go
for
a
walk.
We
better
not.
We
can
keep
an
eye
on
the
car.
My
dad.
Just
tell
him
you
had
to
put
-
Hey,
see
that
divot
there?
That's
where
l
reamed
this
guy
today
-
Really?
-

Maybe
they
went
with
your
dad.
-
We're
cooked.

Does
anyone
have
any
mints?
-
Sorry.
Bye,
Parkie.
-
We'll
walk
you
to
the
door.
Why
not?
Just
don't.
OK.
Will
you
call
me?
Uh,
absolutely.
-
Bye.
Bye.


Where
have
you
been?
Get
in!

l
didn't
care
how
she
got
home.
l
mean,
l
liked
her,
l
liked
her
a
lot,
lt
was
just
different
then.
That
was
the
last
time
l
saw
her.
You
know,
most
people
But
at
least
l
tasted
it
once,
right?
lt's
time
for
your
Given
Lux's
failure
to
make
curfew,

But
few
anticipated
it
would
be
so
drastic.
The
girls
were
taken
out
of
school...
..and
Mrs
Lisbon
shut
the
house
She
had
done
more
than
That
Sunday,
..Mrs
Lisbon
commanded
Lux
Now!

But,
Mom!
This
is
final,
Luxie.
-
lt's
not
fair!

Now,
Luxie!
Come
on.
Hold
on.
Kiss!
Please
don't
make
me
do
this.
Burn
it.

Oh,
Mom.
Aerosmith!
-
Come
on.
Don't
make
me
burn
this.

What's
that
smell?
lt's
all
right.
That'll
do
for
now.
l'll
put
them
in
the
trash.



This
was
the
time
we
began
to
see
Lux
..with
random
boys
and
men.
-
ls
she
naked?
Well,
get
it
focused.
-
Will
you
stop?
Wait
your
turn.
-
They're
rolling
around
up
there.
Hold
on.
And
she's
on
him
and
-
Come
on,
let
me
look.
-

Our
male
up
there
That
Burger
Chalet
-
you
never
think
She
turns
to
me
and
asks
me
l
knew
what
to
say.
l
said
no.
Then
she
grabs
my
hand
l
didn't
say
anything.

Chase,
honey!
You're
not
gonna
believe
it.
-
Her
hands
are
moving
down.
-
This
is
beautiful.
-
What's
she
doin',
man?
Now
they're
done,
he's
getting
up.
-
That's
it?
That
was
quick.

Ooh,
good
morning!
Have
we
photosynthesised

Hello,
Ronald.
Hi,
Eric.
Your
daughters
haven't
been
at
school
You
checked
out
back?

They
found
a
new
math
teacher.
-
Well,
he's
gonna
have
to
get
another
job.

How
long
can
those
girls
-
Just
go
away.
This
is
our
tree.
Girls,
it's
a
little
late.
This
tree
is
dead.
-
Why
not
leave
it
up
to
nature?
That's
what
it's
gonna
be
like
anyway.
lf
boats
hadn't
brought
the
fungus,
OK?
Let's
go.
No?
All
right.
That's
it.
l
have
an
order
to
cut
down
your
elm
tree,
-
How
do
you
know
that
tree's
sick?
Our
daughter
said
Aritex
is
lt
doesn't
work.
l
leave
that
tree,
Will
be
anyway,
way
things
are
going!
l
don't
want
to
call
the
police.
Our
daughters
are
standing
on
their
own
Right.

Uh...
Clive,
did
you
see
those
girls
in
the
Honey,
move
forward.
Oh,
God.
OK.
There
you
go.
ls
that
good?
OK?
Four
sisters
of
Cecilia
Lisbon,
..whose
suicide
last
summer
focused
..put
their
own
lives
in
jeopardy
by
trying

For
the
next
few
weeks
Joe
Hill
Conley
didn't
call
Therese
And
Lux
never
spoke
to
Trip
again.

You're
a
stone
fox.
The
girls'
only
contact
with
the
outside...
..was
through
catalogues
they
ordered
..with
pictures
of
high-end
fashions
Unable
to
go
anywhere,...
..the
girls
travelled
in
their
imaginations
..or
passed
an
old
man
with
a
leaf
broom
We
ordered
the
same
catalogues...
..and,
flipping
through
the
pages,
..stopping
every
now
and
then
..placing
our
hands
..and
gazing
off
at
papaya
sunsets.
We
drank
tea
with
them
We
did
whatever
we
wanted.
Cecilia
hadn't
died.
The
only
way
..was
through
these
impossible
trips
..making
us
happier
Collecting
everything
we
could
of
theirs,
But
they
were
slipping
away.
The
colour
of
their
eyes
was
fading,
along
From
five
they
had
become
four,...
..and
they
were
all
living
in
the
dead,
We'd
have
lost
them
completely
OK,
one
long,...
..two
short...
-
..and
one
long.
You
got
that?
That's
it.
''Help.''
''Send...
..bo...
..bo.''
-
Bo-bo?
That's
what
it
says:
bo-bo.
''Help
send
bo-bo''?
Something
here
for
you.
l
got
one,
too.
We
racked
our
brains
Tom
Faheem
suggested
we
fly
a
kite
..but
that
had
logistical
problems.
ln
the
end,
the
answer
was
so
simple
We
called
them
on
the
telephone.
727...
-
..8221
.

Get
ready.
-

Hello?

*
Hello,
it's
me
*
l've
thought
about
us
Call
us.

*
l
was
cheerful,
bright
and
gay
*
Looking
forward
to
-
who
wouldn't
do?
-
*
The
role
l
was
about
to
play
*
But
in
my
hour
of
need
*
l
truly
am
indeed
*
Alone
again
*
Naturally

*
Run
to
me
if
you
need
a
shoulder
*
Now
and
then
you
need
someone
older
*
So
darling

*
So
far
away
*
Doesn't
anybody
stay
*
lt
would
be
so
fine
*
Doesn't
help
to
know
you're
just
far

Away
l
gotta
go
home.
See
ya
tomorrow.
l'll
see
you
later.
-

We're
suffocating.
l
can't
breathe
in
here.
No
answer.
-

What
time
is
it?
-
Guys,
there
it
is.

Yeah,
it's
them.

Let's
go!

l
have
keys
to
my
mom's
car.
-

Maybe
we
should
knock.

We're
here.
About
time.
We've
been
waiting
for
you
guys.
We
got
a
car,
a
full
tank.
lt's
just
a
Cougar,
but
it's
got
a
big
trunk.
Can
l
sit
up
front?
Sure.
Which
one
of
you
Where
are
your
parents?
Asleep.
-
What
about
your
sisters?
Come
on,
it's
getting
late.
Wait
five
minutes.
We
had
to
wait
They
take
for
ever.
We
better
take
our
car.
Think
you
can
handle
a
station
wagon?
Sure.
lt's
not
a
stick,
is
it?
-
No.
-
Will
you
let
me
steer?
But
maybe
we
should
go.
Come
on
in.
l'll
go
wait
in
the
car.



These
girls
are
making
me
crazy.
What?


We
would
never
be
sure
We
argue
about
it
still.
Most
likely
Bonnie
had
died
while
we
..dreaming
of
highways.
Mary
put
her
head
in
the
oven
Therese,
stuffed
with
sleeping
pills,
Lux
was
the
last
to
go.


lt's
four
o'clock
on
Sunday
afternoon.


This
has
been
Lydia
Perl

None
of
my
daughters
There
was
plenty
of
love
in
our
house.
l
never
understood
why...
After
the
suicide
free-for-all
the
Lisbons
They
had
Mr
Hedlie
pack
up
the
house,...
..selling
what
furniture
he
could
Mr
Lisbon
put
the
house
on
the
market...
..and
it
was
sold
to
We,
of
course,
took
the
family
photos

We
had
pieces
of
the
puzzle,
but
however
..oddly
shaped
emptiness,
..like
countries
we
couldn't
name.
What
lingered
after
them
was
not
life,
..a
clock
ticking
on
the
wall,...
..a
room
dim
at
noon,...
..the
outrageousness
of
a
human
being
We
began
the
impossible
process
Our
parents
seemed
..returning
to
their
tennis
foursomes
..as
though
they'd
seen
this
all
before.
lt
was
full-fledged
summer
again,
over
..spreading
the
poison
in
the
air.
A
spill
at
the
plant
..and
produced
a
scum
of
algae
so
thick
..infiltrating
the
genteel
mansions.
Debutantes
cried
over
the
misfortune
..everyone
would
remember
The
O'Conners,
however,
..of
making
the
theme
of
their
daughter
Like
everyone
else,

She'll
give
him
a
heart
attack!


Hi,
Parkie.

Al's
got
the
acting
bug,
you
know.
-
She
caught
it
from
Pinkie.
And
l
want
to
announce
tonight
..Alice
is
going
to

l
hear
they
have
-
ln
fact,
Sam,
didn't
your
father
build
it?
We're
so
proud
of
Alice.

l've
had
it.
Goodbye,
cruel
world.
No,
no,
no,
you
don't
understand
me!
l'm
a
teenager.
l
got
problems!

So
much
has
been
said
But
we
have
never
found
an
answer.
lt
didn't
matter
in
the
end
..or
that
they
were
girls.
But
only
that
we
had
loved
them,...
..and
that
they
hadn't
heard
us
calling,...
..still
do
not
hear
us
calling
them
..where
they
went
to
be
alone
..and
where
we
will
never
find
the
pieces

*
l'm
a
high
school
lover
*
And
you're
my
favourite
flavour
*
Love
is
all
*
All
my
soul
*
You're
my
playground
love
*
Yet
my
hands
are
shaking

my
body
remains

Time's
no
matter
*
l'm
on
fire
*
On
the
playground

*
You're
the
piece
of
gold
*
That
flushes
all
my
soul
*
Extra
time
*
On
the
ground
*
You're
my
playground

*
Any
time

Anywhere

You're
my
playground
