of
a
humiliation.

at
this
point--
-
I
suggest
you
keep
your
voice
down.
-

What
the
hell
I
want
to
know
why
I
found
them
I
didn't
throw
them
away,
okay?
And
if
you
don't
get
out
of
here
right
-
Okay?
What?
Come
on,
one
date.
Oh,
fine
fine,
okay?

Nanny.
Before
we
head
over
I
would
like
you
to
know
It
seems
that
Grayer
was
Um...
-
That
must
be
upsetting.
Unacceptable.
Grayer:
-

-
Grayer:
Get
away
from
me!
Don't
be
afraid.
-
I
hate
them.
They
scare
me!
Grayer,
go
to
your
mommy.
-
Huh-uh.
-
Go.
Go
on,
sweetheart.
As
I
was
saying,
Nanny,
we
feel
that
you
are
not
on
educational
activities
Therefore
we
have
decided
to
fully
research

Whatever's

for
Grayer.
...starting

evening.
Do
you
