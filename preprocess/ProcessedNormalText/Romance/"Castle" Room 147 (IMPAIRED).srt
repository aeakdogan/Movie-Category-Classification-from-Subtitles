We
don't
get
too
many
transfers
-
Where
you
from?
I'm
just
so
excited
Yeah,
well,
don't
get
too
excited.
Same
rooms
as
the
ones
Same
beds,
same
carpets,

Oh,
my
God.
Do
I
smell
coffee?
If
you
do,
it
was
made
by
elves.
-
Ohh!
-
Aah!
Geez!
You
scared
me.
Yeah,
I
think
we
all
just

What
are
you
doing
here?
Oh,
my
tutoring
job
went
late,
and
the
train
so
I
crashed
here.
Hope
you
don't
mind.
No!
No,
of
course
not.
Matter
of
fact,
um,
now
that
you've
broken
up
there's
really
no
reason
Actually,
there
are
many
reasons,
starting
with
"I
have
a
lease."
Ah.
I
told
you
And
you
know
I...
I
don't
like
you
Dad,
it's
fine.
I
can
handle
it.
I
got
to
go.
I
have
an
early
class.

And
we
have
an
early
murder.

Well,
it
was
one
thing
when
she
was
living
there
with
Pi,
but
now
that
she's
alone,
why
not
dump
the
dump
and
come
home?

Well,
maybe
She
doesn't
have
time
for
independence.
She's
got
her
tutoring
gigs,
She's
exhausted.
Well,
Castle,
Maybe
it's
pride.
If
it
were
pride,
she'd
be
more...
well,
proud.
No,
there's
something
else...
Another
reason
Sito!
Yeah.
Someone
miss
a
check-out?
No,
he
checked
out,
all
right.
Housekeeping
found
this
guy,
dead
in
room
147.
His
driver's
license
Single
gunshot
to
the
chest?
One
is
all
it
took.
Based
on
the
entry
wound,
Lividity
and
liver
temp
put
the
time
of
death
And
he
wasn't
found
until
morning?
So
how
come
no
one
heard
the
shot?
All
the
neighboring
rooms
are
empty.
The
manager
says
that
the
place
Did
the
manager
mention
The
room
was
in
his
name
alone.
Ryan's
trying
to
track
down
to
see
if
he
can
get
some
more
details.
There's
no
sign
of
forced
entry,
though.
So
either
the
killer
was
with
him,
-
or
the
victim
let
him
in.
It
looks
like
he
took
a
bottle
of
water
from
this
mini-fridge,
and
then
he
took
the
chair
down
There's
no
luggage.
You
said
he
lives
nearby.
I
don't
know.
I
checked
his
phone.
There
was
no
indication
of
a
meeting.
There
was
no
appointments,
in
the
hours
leading
up
to
his
death.
Hey.
Found
the
desk
clerk
Something's
up
with
this
guy.
Jane:
Uh,
Mr.
Marquette
No
reservation,
which
is
not
unusual.
Jane,
tell
them
about
the
room.
Well,
that
was
unusual.
He
asked
to
stay
in
room
147.
In
fact,
he
insisted
on
it.
Is
there
anything
special
about
147?
No,
all
our
rooms
are
identical.
That's
why
it
was
so
strange.
Had
he
been
here
before?
Well,
he's
not
in
the
system,
which
means
he's
never
been
a
guest
at
any
Best
Traveler
hotel.
Did
he
mention
why
he
was
staying?
He
didn't
have
to.
Good-looking
guy,
no
bags,
In
my
experience,
that
means
Did
he
come
here
with
anyone?
No,
but
he
was
texting
with
someone.
I
figured
that's
who
he
was
meeting.
He
texted?
Are
you
sure?
We
didn't
find
any
texts
on
his
phone.
I'm
positive.
There.
See?
He's
texting.
On
a
flip
phone.
That's
not
the
phone
we
found.
As
far
as
I
can
tell,
that's
the
only
cellphone
So
the
one
we
saw
in
the
video
Which
the
killer
took
So
who
is
this
guy,
why
a
second
phone,
and
why
room
147?
I
didn't
get
much
Coverage
is
sketchy,
in
the
hallway
outside
Justin's
room.
Did
you
get
ahold
of
next
of
kin?
Not
yet,
but
I
did
find
out
through
his
personal
website.
He's
got
his
own
website?
Yeah,
he
was
an
actor...
a
struggling
one,
"Justin
Marquette"
"is
a
member
"and
is
currently
appearing"
"in
their
off-off-off
"of
Chekhov's
'Platonov.'"
That's
a
lot
of
"off"
s.

This

We're
here
about
Justin
Marquette.
What
about
Justin?
Is
he
okay?

We
met
through
the
theater
company
and
started
dating
three
months
ago.

I
knew
something
was
wrong
when
he
didn't
show
up
And
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
him?
Yesterday
morning
at
my
place.
We,
um...
we
went
for
a
run,
and
then
he
showered
and
left
for
work.
Where
did
he
work?
Temp
jobs,
mostly.
He
wasn't
getting
much
recently,
but
he
said
that
he
didn't
mind,
because
it
gave
him
more
time
Any
idea
what
he
would
be
doing
at
the
Best
Traveler
Hotel
last
night?
No...
uh,
hotel?
He
was...
he
was
at
a
hotel?

Look,
Laura,
but
is
it
possible
that
Justin
What?
No.
Was
he
involved
in
anything
No,
not...
not
that
I
know
of.
No.
Was
there
anyone
in
his
life
that
might
have
wanted
to
harm
him?
There
was
that
thing
What
thing?
Some
crazy
woman
walked
up
and
threatened
him.
That's
right.
He
could
barely
perform
that
night.
-
Did
he
know
who
she
was?
And
he
did
not
want
to
All
he
said
was
that
it
happened
on
9th
and
Mercer.
Thanks.
Hey.
That
was
the
coffee
shop.
A
barista
saw
the
whole
thing
go
down.
A
woman
walked
up
to
Justin
outside
and
started
yelling
at
him.
-
You
get
a
description?
The
woman's
a
regular
customer.
She's
got
a
loyalty
card,
I'll
send
a
unit
to
pick
her
up.
Great.
Thanks
for
coming
in,
Ms.
Miller.
I'm
detective
Beckett.
Uh,
I
just
need
to
ask
you
Justin
Marquette.
So
you
know
him.
I
more
than
know
him,
detective.
In
fact...
I
killed
him.
Are
you
confessing?
Just
give
me
some
paper.
Yeah.

11
seconds
to
a
confession.
That's
got
to
be
your
personal
best.

You
sound
like
Well,
I
am,
a
little.
I
mean,
a
secret
phone,
room
147...
this
case
had
conspiratorial
promise.
Well,
most
likely
Justin
was
cheating
and
the
two
of
them
met
up
at
the
hotel,
and
that's
where
things
went
south.
Yes,
well,
most
likely,
that
is
boring.
Look,
not
every
case
has
to
be
shrouded
Yo.
Uh,
we
got
a
problem.
What's
wrong?
Well,
I
was
looking
into
to
try
to
tie
her
to
the
hotel,
show
that
she
was
at
So
maybe
someone
else
Nah.
The
manager
I.D.'d
her.
And
he
said
that
she
split
her
A.A.

I
just
spoke
to
him,
and
he
confirmed
that
they
were
together
But
that's
our

If
that's
true,
Then
why
is

Not
so

all.

we

to

up

in

Room

At
the
Best

Hotel.

He
opened
it
almost
immediately.
Been
waiting
for
you.
Come
on
in.
Let
me
get
you
a
water.
He
offered
me
a
bottle
of
water,
and
then
he
went
to
the
mini-fridge.
That's
when
I
took
out
the
gun.
He
turned
around
I
shot
him.
I
shot
him
in
the
chest.
And
then
what
happened?
He
looked
surprised.
He
staggered
back.
He
dropped
the
bottle
of
water,
and
he
kind
of
gripped
onto
Then
he
fell
and
knocked

That's
exactly

How?
How
is
that
possible?
Anita,
what
was
your
relationship
with
Justin
Marquette?
My
relationship?
Were
the
two
of
you
involved?
Uh,
I
don't
think
so.
Then
how
did
you
know
him?
I'm
not
sure.
If
you
don't
know
how
you
knew
him,
then
why
would
you
kill
him?
I'm
an
alcoholic.
He
was
responsible
for
my
drinking.
How
was
he
responsible?

I've
been
really
confused
lately.
Because
of
the
drinking.
No,
I've
been
sober
for
four
years.

these
last

Do
you

Mm-hmm.

he
was

had
to
warn

The
moment
I
saw

I'm

enough
to
admit
Maybe
Anita
suffered
I've
ordered
a
psych
eval,
but
psychosis
doesn't
explain
how
she
knew
all
about
the
murder.
Or
why
she
killed
the
guy
I
double-checked
her
phone
records.
There's
not
a
single
call
or
text
between
her
and
Justin
Marquette.
It's
like
they
had
no
history
at
all.
Okay,
why
don't
you
guys
and
check
everything...
and
let's
see
that'll
connect
her
to
our
victim.
We're
on
it.
Detective
Beckett,
Mr.
Castle,
Thank
you
so
much
for
coming
in,
I
gather
you
have
a
patient
for
me.
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
we've
been
through
No
gun,
no
bloody

not,

check
out

pages
have
been
ripped
out,
including
all

weeks.
-
Two
weeks?
Wait
a
minute.
-
That's
how
long
Anita
says
she's
been
Maybe
she
kept
a
calendar

Yeah,
looks
like
she
did,
but
the
same
two
weeks
have
been
erased.
Seems
like
someone's
Yeah,
but
who?
And
what?
As
much
as
I
love
a
good
mystery,
a
small
part
of
me
is
hoping
on
what
the
hell
is
going
on.
Uh,
speaking
of
clarity,
when
you
said
that
there
that's
keeping
Alexis
I
don't
know!
And
Alexis
won't
talk
about
it,
so...
Maybe
when
Dr.
Holloway's
I
can
get
him
to
talk
to
Alexis.

Hey.
So,
what's
the
verdict?
Based
on
my
examination
so
far,
I
find
her
to
be
mentally
competent,
if
somewhat
disoriented.
By
all
indications,
she
seems
Meaning
she
did
kill
Justin
Marquette?
Or
she
believes
she
did,
anyway.
And
what
about
the
disorientation?
How
do
you
account
for
that?
Could
be
medical
adverse
reaction
to
drugs.
It's
possible
she
experienced
which
caused
some
sort
So,
traumatic
like
killing
someone?
Potentially.
I'll
know
more
Thank
you,
doctor.
So,
Anita
Miller
but
the
facts
say
she
couldn't
have.
No,
not
all
the
facts.
I
mean,
we
know
she
accosted
she
confessed
to
the
murder,
and
she
has
intimate
knowledge
So,
look.
Clearly,
we
haven't
but
you
believe
she
killed
him.

I
think
that
until
something
changes,
she's
our
best
suspect.
Detective,
there's
someone
here
This
is
Sam
Carson.
Tell
her
what
you
told
me.
I
want
to
confess
to
a
murder.
I
killed
Justin
Marquette.
I'd
say
something
just
changed.
Yeah,
it
was
me.
Don't
get
me
wrong...
Did
I
hear
right?
Another
person
Yeah,
but
I
just
think
he's
Yeah...
so
far,
the
confession
is
just
a
rehash
of
the
news
report.
Mr.
Carson,
do
you
realize
that
making
false
statements
I'm
telling
you
the
truth.
I
killed
the
guy
in
his
hotel
room.
Okay,
fine.
What
room
was
that?
Um...

147.
It
was
room
147.
I
need
you
to
tell
me
I
was
in
his
room,
uh...
No,
no.
I
need
details.
Were
you
hiding
in
the
closet?
No.
I
knocked.
Been
waiting
for
you.
Come
on
in.
Let
me
get
you
a
water.
He
let
me
in,
offered
me
a
water.
Beckett:
A
water?
Yeah,
like,
a
bottle.
Then
he...
he
went
to
the
fridge.
That's
when
I
pulled
out
my
gun.
He
turned
around,
and
I
shot
him...
right
in
the
chest.
And
then
what?
He
fell
back,
grabbed
for
a
chair,
knocked
it
over
when
he
fell
down.
Then
I
left.
Why
did
you
kill
him?
Why?
Yeah.
'Cause
I
was
angry.
I
got
anger
issues,
you
know?
And
when
I
saw
him,
Because
he
did
what
to
you?
That's...
that's
the
part
The
last...
last
couple
of
weeks
How
did
you
know
the
victim?
I
don't...
I
don't
know
that
I
do.
Okay.
He
filled
you
with
rage,
-
Did
he
contact
you?
How
do
you
not
remember?
What
kind
of
game
are
you
playing
here?
-
I'm
not
playing
any
game!
You're
trying
to
sabotage
my
case!
You
know
that
no
D.A.
with
multiple
confessions!
Multiple
confessions?
Yeah,
you
and
Anita
Miller
You're
either
covering
for
each
other,
or
you're
covering
Who
the
hell
is
Anita
Miller?
You
know
who
she
is.
I've
never
seen
that
woman
I'm
telling
you,
I
don't
know
him.
Are
you
sure
about
that?
Because
Sam
told
us
but
that
he
killed
Justin.
Well,
he's
lying.
So,
we
can't
find
a
link
or
between
either
one
of
them
What
about
Sam's
alibi?
His
brother
says
that
he
and
Sam
were
at
the
batting
cages
And
based
on
the
security
video,
Sam
never
set
foot
in
the
hotel.
They
both
believe
they
killed
Justin,
they
both
know
details
about
the
murder,
and
they
both
have
I
mean,
they
must
be
connected.
What
if
their
lives
intersect,
literal
sense?
No.
Castle,
no.
Please.
If
this
is
some
I'm
not
in
the
mood.
Really?
Alternate
universe...
that's
how
little
you
think
of
me.
I'm
sorry.
I'm...
I'm
sorry.
I
just...
I
thought
that
you...
No,
they're
psychically
linked.
And
not
just
to
each
other,
See,
they're
seeing
the
crime
And
the
experience
is
so
visceral
that
both
Sam
and
Anita
think
that
they
committed

I'm
sorry.
It's
just,
you
got
excited.
-
It's
kind
of
cute.
You
know
how
I
like
the
weird
stuff.

Who's
that?
Oh,
uh,
it's

Nothing.
It's...

here
to
turn
myself
in...
...for
killing
Justin
Marquette.
No.
All
right.
This
is
now
Hey.
You
guys
need
to
see
this.
Wait,
I...
I
need
to
confess.
Yeah,
take
a
number.
Once
we
realized
that
someone
might've
we
had
UNIs
canvass
the
area.
Now,
one
of
Anita's
neighbors
parked
outside
her
place
Right
when
she
started
Yeah,
not
only
that,
we
checked
in
with
Sam
Carson's
neighbors.
Turns
out,
one
of
them
remembers
parked
outside
of
Carson's
house
She
remembers
it
because
she
Did
you
get
a
plate
number?
No,
but
she
took
a
picture
Take
a
look
who's
behind
the
wheel.
Is
that...
A
big,
bald
man,
just
like
the
one
Anita
said
she
saw
talking
to
our
victim
So
our
victim
and
two
suspects
do
have
something
in
common.
Yeah...
him.
-
So,
now
there
are
three
of
them.
But
we
believe
that
this
man
His
van
was
seen
outside
and
Anita
I.D.'d
him
as
the
guy
that
was
talking
to
our
victim
And
what
is
this
man's
That's
what
I'm
gonna
find
out.
I...
I'm
prepared
and
admit
to
what
I
did.
Yes,
I'm
sure
you
are.
Don't
you
want
to
hear
my
confession?
Best
Traveler
Hotel,
room
147,
Justin
offered
you
water,
How...
how
did
you
know?
Beckett?
Just
like
the
one
Anita
drew.
Dwight,
what
does
that
symbol
mean?
I...
uh,
uh,
I
don't...
I
don't
know.
It's
just
been
stuck
in
my
head
lately.
But
what
difference
does
that
make?
-
I...
I
shot
a
guy!
Now,
can
you
take
a
close
look
and
tell
me
if
you
recognize
that
man?
Uh...
no,
but
the
van
looks
familiar.
You've
seen
it
before?
Where?
Uh,
I'm
not
sure.
I've...
I've
been...
Confused
recently,
Dwight,
think.
This
is
important.
Uh...
it...
it
was
last
Tuesday...
I
was
coming
home
from...
and...
and
that
van
outside
my
apartment.
There
are
traffic
cams
on
Houston.
They
might've
caught
a
plate
number.
Um...
seriously?
I
killed
someone,
All
right.
Techs
scrubbed
from
last
Tuesday
on
Houston.
They
got
a
hit
on
our
vehicle.
It's
registered
to
a
Miles
Madsen.
Great.
That's
our
guy.
That
he's
in
the
wind...
but
the
landlord
said

Find
out
everything
you
can
about
him.
Right
now,
he's
the
only
link
Where
you
going?
Uh,
I've
got
an
errand
to
run.
Can
you
tell
Castle
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks
for
meeting
with
me.
Yeah.
What's
so
important?
Um...
You
know
that
I
don't
take
sides
on
anything
Yeah.
I
appreciate
that.
Okay,
well...
your
dad
wants
you
to
move
back
home.
And
I
know
that
you
said
but
you
also
said
why
you
didn't
want
to
I
want
to
make
sure
that
one
Oh,
no.
No,
no,
it's...
it's
not
you
at
all.
Are
you
sure?
'Cause
the
last
thing
I
want
to
do
is
make
you
feel
unwelcome
No,
it's...
not
you,
it's
me.
All
those
things
my
dad
said
about
me
making
a
mistake
he
was
right.
I
can
see
it
so
clearly
now.
Why
didn't
I
then?
You
were
in
the
love
haze.
The
love
haze?
It's
like
a
drug!
It
makes
intelligent
people
Then
it
clears,
and
you
look
around,
and
you
wonder,
"what
was
I
thinking?"
Your
dad
just
wants
to
help.
It's
okay
to
let
him.
Yes,
but
this
was
my
mistake.
He
shouldn't
have
to
pay
for
it,
so
I
will
tutor
until
the
lease
is
up.
Okay.
I
get
it.
I
know
what
you're
doing
I
mean,
the
long
hours,
what
you're
actually
doing
Trust
me.
I've
been
there.
This...
this
isn't
necessary.
Your
dad
loves
you.
He
worries
about
you.
I
think
your
penance
is
paid.


Uh,
just
think
about
it,
okay?
I'll
see
you.

Hey,
did
you
guys
find
Madsen?
No,
but
we're
getting
close.
We
figured
out
that
he's
for
Apollo
Pinnacle,
Inc.
Ryan:
Which
turns
out
to
be
a
front
for
another
organization
called
E.H.I.,
or
Eternal
Horizons
Institute.
And
what
is
that?
Well,
to
quote
their
website,
"E.H.I.
provides
sanctuary,
"and
pathways
to
the
ultimate
self."
They
claim
to
have
thousands
But
not
all
of
them
In
2005,
three
of
those
followers
died
in
some
kind
of
sweat-lodge
initiation.
Charges
were
filed,
but,
ultimately,
the
deaths
were
ruled
accidental.
Followers?
Initiations?
Oh,
it's
a
cult,
all
right,

That's
the
symbol
that
Anita
Yes,
and
the
boys
checked.
Okay,
so,
the
three
of
them
must
have
been
a
part
of
That's
our
connection.
Except
we
asked
each
of
them.
Yeah,
but
they
also
said
that
and
we
know
So,
where
is
this
E.H.I.?
Right
here
in
the
city...
Midtown.
This
case
is
exceeding
An
impossible
murder
connected
to
a
shadowy
Not
to
mention
prosperous.
This
is
prime
Manhattan
real
estate.

Hi.
We're
here
to
see
Dr.
Bauer.
-
I'm...
Richard
Castle.
Welcome
to
E.H.I.
Dr.
Bauer's
expecting
you.
How?
We
didn't
make
an
appointment.
Dr.
Bauer's
a
brilliant
man.
Right
this
way.
He's
just
inside.
Yeah,
uh...
No,
he's
not!
On
the
contrary.
Whoa.

Greetings,
detective
Beckett,
What
can
I
do
for
you?
Well,
uh,
you
could
start
Regrettably,
I'm
in
Stockholm,
Okay.
Well,
then...
do
you
know
this
man,
Justin
Marquette?
I'm
afraid
not.
What
about
this
man,
Miles
Madsen?
I
understand
he
works
for
you.
Mr.
Madsen
has
not
been
employed
years,
in
fact.
Well,
what
did
Mr.
Madsen
do
Since
he
is
no
longer
in
my
employ,
I
don't
see
the
relevance.
The
relevance
is
that
he
is
connected
I'm
struck
by
the
level
It's
not
healthy.
You
know
what
I'm
struck
by
as
to
why
a
homicide
detective
Former
employee.
Well,
whatever
he
is,
he
is
along
with
three
other
members
Anita
Miller,
Sam
Carson,
I'm
sorry,
detective.
Those
people
are
not
part
of
E.H.I.
Wow.
That's...
amazing
how
you
would
just
know
that
off
the
top
of
your
head.
I
make
a
point
of
meeting
every
The
people
you
mentioned
Well,
then,
I'm
sure
you
won't
mind
if
we
check
your
files,
along
with
the
records
You'd
need
a
warrant
for
that,
detective,
and
you
won't
get
one.
What's
that?
They're
ready.
I'm
sorry.
My
session
is
starting.
Jasmine
will
show
you
out.
No.
Dr.
Bauer,
I...
uh...
Right
this
way.
Bauer
was
right.
The
judge
turned
us
down
You
really
think
E.H.I.'s
I
think
that
he
knows
where
Madsen
is
and
that
Madsen
But
doing
what?
And
what
does
any
of
this
have
to
do
with
a
struggling
actor
-
Huh.
Uh,
the
E.H.I.
website...
the
testimonials
claim
that
help
people
quit
smoking,
take
charge
of
their
lives.
So?
So,
all
three
of
our
confessors
have
had
problems
in
their
anger
management,
all
things
that
they
could've
But
they
all
claim
that
they
didn't.
But
what
if
they
did?
What
if
they
did,
but
something
made
E.H.I.
any
record
of
their
involvement?
Torn
date-book
pages,
wiped
calendars.
Maybe
that's
why
Madsen
to
erase
any
trace
Castle,
you
can't
just
do
that
You'd
have
to...
wipe
memories.
Think
about
it.
The
fogginess,
the
confusion
So
y...
you're
saying
that
can
erase
people's
memories?
How?
With
drugs.
Anita
Miller's
tests
came
back.
Found
unusual
levels
in
her
system,
so
I
tested
Mr.
Carson
It
was
in
their
blood,
as
well.
Propranolol?
In
small
doses,
it's
mainly
In
high
doses,
it's
been
found
even
eliminate
them.
If
it
can
alter
memories,
they
had
done
something
Under
normal
circumstances,
the
human
brain
is
very
suggestible.
Combined
with
a
drug
like
this,

-
Excuse
me.
Outstanding.
This
is
straight
out
of
"Inception."
Someone
planted
the
memory
of
the
murder
in
all
three
of
their
heads,
while
erasing
any
knowledge
Castle,
do
you
have
any
idea
It's
a
diabolical
plan.
Have
three
suspects
making
it
impossible
But
none
of
this
explains
of
the
murder
Maybe...
they
were
there,
just...
not
in
person.
What
if
Justin's
killer
and
then
showed
it
to
these
people
while
they
were
in
They
would
think
the
images
were
drawn
from
their
own
experience.
If
they
were
shown
the
actual
murder,
then
that
makes
With
details
of
the
crime
that
could
lead
to
our
real
killer.
I'm
telling
you,
So
did
I.
Look,
I
understand
but
it
may
not
be.
But
why
would
somebody
do
this
to
us?
To
get
away
with
murder.
We
just
need
you
to
tell
us
about
being
in
that
hotel
room,
down
to
the
last
overheard
whisper
or...
or
glimpse
of
a
shadow
in
a
mirror.
Now,
keep
in
mind
that
what
may
actually
be
the
key
So,
let's
start
with
Anita.
The
first
thing
I
remember
After
a
few
seconds,
Justin
opened
it.
He
smiled
flirtatiously,
and...
okay,
he
did
not
flirt
with
me.
No,
he
was
businesslike.
And,
uh,
what
did
you
see
I
remember
the
carpet.
It
was
beige.
The
wallpaper
and
there
was
a
painting
I...
I
think
it
was
a
landscape.
Yeah,
of
a
countryside.
And
when
he
pulled
out
the
bottle
of
water
from
the
fridge,
I
remember
there
were
six
other
bottles
in
the
fridge
door
there.
No,
there
were
five.
Nuh-unh.
There
were
six.
I
remember
five,
too.
See?
I
know
what
I
saw.

-
There
were
five.
Castle,
if
they
can't
agree
then
I
don't
think
Au
contraire.
We've
already
learned
something
Come
with
me.
Where
we
going?
Back
to
the
hotel.
You
guys
are
clearly
lying,
okay?
I...
Come
on,
Castle.
Could
you
just
tell
me
Not
until
I
know
I'm
right.
Which...
I
am.
You
should
know
Yes,
a
genius
at
annoying
me.
So,
I'm
Justin,
and
you
are
one
of
I'm
starting
to
feel
the
urge.
I
go
to
get
you
a
bottle
tell
me
how
many
bottles
None.
The
door's
blocking
it.
Exactly.
Which
means
Anita,
Sam,
or
Dwight
couldn't
have
seen
it,
either.
Whatever
they
saw...
It
didn't
happen
in
this
room!
Okay,
if
they
didn't
witness
then
what
did
they
see?
Something
that
happened
i...
in
another
room
147.
We
checked
other
branches
in
the
area.
Now,
three
weeks
ago,
the
Best
Traveler
in
Long
Island
City
rented
an
entire
floor,
Their
room
147
is
identical
to
the
one
where
we
found
our
victim.
Except
that
fridge
opens
exactly
like
our
witnesses
described
it.
What
was
E.H.I.
doing
there?
They
told
the
hotel
it
was
But
they
brought
their
own
security,
and
they
kept
hotel
staff
Something
happened
that
day,
something
connected
to
Justin's
murder,
that
E.H.I.
wants
everyone
to
forget.

I
got
something.
All
right,
so
I
was
going
of
the
Best
Traveler
Inn
I
wanted
to
see
if
any
did
attend
that
E.H.I.
event.
And...?
No
sign
of
them,
but
I
did
see
this.
-
That's
our
victim.
Dr.
Bauer
lied
to
us.
He
did
know
Justin.
We
got
enough
for
a
warrant
now?

Please,
you
can't
take
those
files!
Really?
That's
not
what
my
warrant
says.
Now,
where's
Dr.
Bauer?
I
told
you,
he's
in
Stockholm!
Where
in
Stockholm?
What
hotel?
I
don't
know!
He
didn't
leave
a
contact
number!
Detective,
I
traced
the
signal
from
Bauer's
video
conference
So
where
in
Stockholm
is
he?
That's
the
thing.
The
signal
was
routed
through
Stockholm,
but
it
looks
like
it
originated
Local,
as
in
Manhattan?
As
in
inside
this
building.
Where?

You
can't
go
back
there!
That
one.
Don't
move!
So
this
is
Stockholm.
All
right.
Yes.
I
knew
him.
But
I
know
nothing
about
his
death.
And
yet
you
were
shredding
files,
files
on
Anita,
Sam,
Dwight,
Madsen...
all
people
connected
with
this
case.
What
happened
that
day?
All
we
did
was
make
a
film.
A
film?
I
didn't
kill
Justin.
I
hired
him
as
an
actor.


It
was
part
of
Been
waiting
for
you.
Come
on
in.
Let
me
get
you
a
water.



project
their
problems
on
a
person...
in
this
case,
Justin.
That's
why
Anita
blamed
him
and...
and
why
he
was
the
focus
I
knew
it.
You
were
implanting
memories.
No!
No,
it
was
supposed
to
of
their
problems
We...
we
made
two
versions,
one
for
women
and
another
for
men.
For
the
therapy
to
work,
in
a
chemically
induced
suggestive
state
while
showing
them
this
footage,
They
began
to
internalize
And
then
they...
they
started
to
believe
they'd
actually
killed
Justin.
We...
we
halted
the
program
immediately.
But
the
damage
was
already
done.
They
threatened
to
sue.
They
said
we
were
using
them
Which
you
were.
We
tried
to
help
them.
We
brought
them
back
to...
correct
the
problem.
And
by
correcting,
you
mean
dosing
them
with
Propranolol
so
that
they
would
forget
We
were
just
trying
to
help
people.
Is
that
why
you
sent
madsen
Madsen
only
talked
with
Justin
to
remind
him
that
prohibited
him
We
knew
nothing
about
his
murder.
And
yet
his
death
was
staged
Why
would
we
do
that
when
we
were
just
trying
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Someone's
targeting
us,
and
knew
they
could
use
it
against
us.
Uh,
uh,
one
of
the
other
test
subjects,
someone
on
the
crew.
I'm
gonna
need
a
list
of
all
of
the
people
Pam:
Be
sure
not
to
step
or
the
backdrop
will
smack
you

Detective
Beckett.
Do
you
have
news
about
Justin's
case?
We
do.
We
now
believe
that
Justin
was
killed
because
of
a
video
that
he
acted
in.
A
video?
It
was
made
for
an
organization
and
it
just
so
happens
it
was
Eddie:
Kahn
Post?
Pam,
isn't
that
where
your
day
job
is?
Yeah,
but
I
don't
know
about
any
video.
We
think
you
do.
And
when
you
saw
the
video,
you
saw
an
opportunity.
Pam,
we
checked
your
credit
card.
We
know
that
So?
So
just
before
Justin
died,
he
was
texting
someone
on
a
flip
phone,
presumably
his
killer.
Beckett:
When
we
looked
into
there
were
texts
supposedly
offering
him
$5,000
to
I'm
betting
that
you
gave
Justin
probably
told
him
someone
from
E.H.I.
But
it
wasn't
E.H.I.
that
You
lured
him
to
that
hotel,
Wait.
This
is
crazy.
Justin
was
my
friend.
Why
would
I
do
that?
We
checked
your
background,
Pam.
One
of
the
men
that
was
killed
in
that
E.H.I.
sweat-lodge
your
brother.
E.H.I.
was
to
blame,
but
no
one
was
held
accountable.
His
death
was
ruled
accidental.
And
when
you
watched
that
video,
you
realized
you
had
the
perfect
But
you
knew
that
you
needed
Justin
in
order
to
pull
it
off,
so
you
found
a
way
to
get
close
to
him.
Oh,
my
God.
That's
why
you
Pam,
what
did
you
do?
You
don't
understand.
I
had
to
do
it...
Those
monsters
had
to
be
stopped.
By
killing
an
innocent
man?
Justin
was
not
innocent.
He
was
just
an
actor,
hired
for
the
day.
Then
why
did
he
stonewall
me
when
I
tried
to
talk
to
him
about
it?!
They
are
all
accountable!
Somebody
had
to
stop
them!
Somebody
had
to
show
the
world
Pam,
turn
around.
You're
under
arrest.

Carson:
So
all
of
this
Yeah,
and,
unfortunately,
you
just
got
caught
in
the
middle.
What
about
Dr.
Bauer?
E.H.I.
has
been
shut
down,
and
the
FBI
is
launching
And
the
guy
in
the
red
van,
Border
patrol
caught
him
He's
being
extradited
back
here
now.
Carruthers:
What
I
don't
understand
is
what
made
us
come
in
when
we
did,
all
on
the
same
day.
Dr.
Holloway
figures
Maybe
you
read
an
article
on
the
murder
or
you
saw
something
on
TV.
Yeah,
but
whatever
it
was,
You're
all
free
to
go.
Dwight,
are
you
okay?
Uh,
it's...
it's
nothing.
No,
what?
I
just
never
got
to
confess.
Well,
if
it
makes
you
Yeah.
Me,
too.
Come
on.
Okay,
uh...
So,
I...
I
walk
up
to
room
147,
If
I
have
to
hear
I'm
gonna
shoot
somebody.
Here's
a
little
something

You
know
I
like
the
weird
ones.
Mmm.
It's
interesting
I
mean,
all
those
people
But
instead,
they
became
Guinea
pigs,
all
because
they
turned
to
Yeah,
well,
sometimes
it's
hard
to
know
who
the
right
person
is.
After
all,
it
took
you
three
tries.
True,
but
I
figured
it
out,
and
you
didn't
even
have
to
drug
me.
How
do
you
know
what
I
do
to
you
Whoa.
Well,
whatever
it
is,

Excuse
me.
Alexis.
What's
going
on?
Dad...
can
I
come
home?
Come
here.
