So
we'll
leave
you,
Okay?
-
I'm
just
not
I

"Ozymandias
melancholia."
Where'd
you
get
that
phrase?

What...
Excuse
me,
are
you...
-
Yes.
How
did
you
-
No,
I
recognized
your
picture
You

all
those

That's
how

No,
I'm
an
architect.
Studying
to
be,
anyhow.

Really?
Where?

Here...
Trastevere.

Yeah,
I
live
here.
I'm
on
Via
dei
Neofiti.

That's
my
old
I've
been
wandering
-
I
can't
seem
to
find
it.
-
Really?
No,
it's
literally
-
Well,
I...

-
What?
Do
you
want
me
to...
-
I
don't
know
But...
Okay.
Why
not?

I
saw
this
honey
for
half
the
price.
Finish
your
breakfast.

I'm
not
hungry.
Where

Camilla?
You
know
why
there's
Because
people
are
being
replaced

Eat!
Here's

No
one's

No
one

I
think.
Look,
look!
Here

I
was
stuck
in
the
elevator
Oh
to
be
young
and
single,
Did
you
see
her
do
that?
Beautiful.
-
You
still
wouldn't
have
a
chance.
-
She
takes
her
weekends
with
the
boss.
-
Since
when?
-
If
you
ask
me...
What,
I
can't
say
one
thing?
It's
an
enigmatic
film.
Beautiful.
-
Oh,
come
on!
The
director
didn't
want
you
...the
atmospheric
cinematography.
if
I
could
vote

But
you
don't
vote.

you
realize
you're
going
to
have

Well,
you
know,
they
gave
us
such

I'm
delighted
to
be

conceivable
I
might
one
day.

Oh,

-
Yeah,
you
just
have
to
ask.

I
wanted
Your
problem
was
that

know,
you
married
I
got
a
150,
160
IQ.
-
You're

it's
much
less.

all
the
characters
I
did
Tosca
once

Jerry
was
ahead
of
his
time.

Yeah,
I
was
a
little,

a
little
fast
You

then
Between
the
critics

I'm
sorry,
you
don't

without
the
unions,
the
worker

Yes,
I
understand
what
you're
saying,
HAYLEY:

great
espresso.
-
Sally?
She's
studying
here.

I
brought
someone
home

gosh!
My
friend,
Monica,
she
called.
She's
going
to
be
in
Rome,
and
I
told
her
-
Ah.
Well,
so
I'll
finally
-
She
just
broke
up
so
she's
a
bit
at
loose
ends.
-
Trouble.
-
What,
trouble?
-
You're
just
going
She's
smart
and
funny
and
interesting.
Men
just
adore
her.
I
think
it's
because
that
she
gives
off.
-
And
how
long
-
Oh,
I
don't
know.
Between
the
breakup,
and
then
her
acting
career
-
Jesus
Christ,
can't
you
see
the
situation
-
What?
Give
me
a
break.
What
do
I
care?
I'm
perfectly
happy
Actually,
judging
Monica's
kind
of
like
a
neurotic,
-
Beautiful,
funny,
and
also
neurotic?
It's
like
filling
Monica.
Even
her
name
is
hot.

Congratulations.
-
Yes?
-
What
gift?
-
What
is
this
special
gift?
-
I
am.
Everything's
been
paid
in
full.
-
I
think
there's
been
a
mistake.
-
That's
okay.
Please
leave.
-
I
can't.
They'd
be
very
upset.
-
They
said
you
were
high-strung
But
you're
the
lucky
winner.
-
The
winner
of
the
bet.
-
Tommy
and
Fabio.
They
paid
me
-
I
don't
know
who
they
are.
-
I
am
told
to
ask
no
questions.
I
am
hereto
fulfill
your
dreams.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
You
are
Mr.
DeBroca,
room
504?
-
You
have
the
right
room
And
now
you
must
leave.
-
Anybody
here?

Excuse
us.
So
sorry.
-
I
told
you
we
should
wait.
-
That
is
not
what
you
think.
-
Our
date
was
for
noon.
The
door
was
open.
-
You
can't
just
barge
in
-
What
a
way
to
meet
your
new
bride.
-
She's
not
my
bride.
-
No?
-
You're
joking
I
hope.
-
Of
course
I'm
joking.
This
is
my
wife.
-
I
am
his
Uncle
Paolo.
-
Giovanna.
-
Uncle
Sal.
-
Aunt
Rita.
-
Anna.
-
Anna?
Isn't
her
name
Milly?
-
Milly?
Uh...
Yes.
Definitely
Milly.
-
Milly?
-
We'll
wait
downstairs.
Let's
go
Paolo.
-
We'll
see
you
soon.

-
I'm
dead.
My
life
is
over.
I'm
ruined.
-
Just
tell
them
the
truth.
It
was
all
a
mistake.
-
How
do
I
do
that?
They
saw
us
on
the
bed.
They
won't
believe
me.
They'll
think
my
wife
is
out
of
the
hotel
Why
did
you
grab
me
like
that?
-
I
was
paid
to
make
love
to
DeBroca.
-
And
you
leave
the
door
open?
Idiot!
They
barged
in.
These
upper
class
feel
entitled.
-
Milly
will
be
back
any
minute.
You
have
to
pretend
to
be
my
wife.
-
Pretend
to
be
your
wife?
And
you
just
called
me
an
idiot.
-
I'm
sorry.
I
apologize.
If
Milly
walks
in
I
will
jump
-
Sooner
or
later
they'll
find
out.
-
I
need
to
buy
more
time,
so
I
can
We
need
to
get
out
of
here
now.
SALLY:
-
I'm
walking
fine.
-
Her
flight
should
Relax.
By
the
time
she
goes
through
we'll
have
been
-
I
hope
that
you
don't
-
In
love
with
her?
-
Well,
men
always,
-
Well,
I'm
crazy
for
you.
Okay,
that's
her.
Monica!
-
Hi!
It's
so
good
to
see
you.
-
You
look
so
great.
-
Nothing
special,
right?
-
No,
no,
nothing
I
got
no
buzz.
I
mean,
look
at
her.
-
Of
course,
she
has
been
But
you
will
admit
-
All
I
can
say
is,
it's
so
subconscious,
She's
no
big
deal.
Certainly
not
some
She's
a
disheveled,
-
I've
been
wanting
you
to
come
for
so
-
Hi.
Hi.
I'm
Jack.
-
This
is
Monica.
-
Hi.
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you.
-
I
mean,
I
must
look
awful.
-
What
do
you
mean?
-
I
mean,
please
-
No,
you
look
fine.
I
just...
I
can
never
I
had
a
scotch
-
Pretty
cozy,
-
I
keep
telling
you,
I
have
no
interest
I
just
hope
having
her
around
is
not
going
to
-
But
there
is
an
element
A
germ,
a
spark,
one
molecule.
God.
I
see
it
so
clearly,
Thank
you.
-
Thank
you.
You're
becoming
SALLY:
Well,
I
figured,
so,
why
not
stay
in?
-
No,
yeah,
it's
perfect,
What
are
you
reading?
-
Oh,
the
poetry
of
Yeats.

-
The
"gong-tormented
sea."
-
Yeah,
yeah.
-
Do
you
want
to
talk
-
Well,
Donald
was
gay.
It
was
my
ego
and
I
couldn't,
-
Oh,
yeah?
-
Well,
I
mean,
but,
I
mean,
let's
just
say
And
it's
such
a
shame
and
he's
so
wonderful
I
mean,
so
much
fun
to
be
with.

I
tried
could
be
as
exciting
than
with
someone
And
he
tried.
He...
He
did
try.
But,
in
the
end,
-
I
remember
you
you
had
when
he
-
Have
you
ever
Me,
sex
with
a
man?
God,
no,
no,
no.
It's
not
something
-
Why
are
you
blushing?
Probably
because
Look,
I
always
had
a
little
yen
for
sleeping
with
a
woman,
it
was...

It
was
very
exciting,
-
I
really
have
no
repressed...
-
I
shot
this
TV
movie
once,
was
with
this
incredible
I
mean,
she
was
to
die.
And
for
whatever
reason,
I
get
this
message
one
day
from
the
assistant
director
would
like
me
to
go
And
why
she
was
so
suddenly
And
I
go.
And
she's
in
a
robe,
and
she
takes
it
off,
and
gives
me
a
big
hug
and
I
just
become
crazed.
I
mean,
I
become
so
excited.
I
mean,
she
was
just
We
had
this
thing
Yeah,
it
was
like
being
And
on
the
one
hand,
but
on
the
other
hand,
And
that's
when
I
started
five
days
a
week,
and...
Well,
fortunately,
and
we
had
And
as
great
as
the
orgasms
were
they
were
stronger

Two

Toasted.

You
prefer
toasted
bread?
-
I
do,
yes.
-
Can
you
tell
us
why?
-
Yes,
well,
I
don't
know.
I
usually
favor
toasted
bread.
-
White
bread
or
wheat
bread?
-
White.

So
it's
safe
to
say
that

slices
of

Yes.
And
coffee

milk.
No
sugar.

Enough!
Move

Sofia!
Get

caught
short
But
quick
thinking
saved
the
moment

the
coffee
was
spilled

so
great.
As
the
Arab
spy,
as
the
terrorist,
I've
always
dreamed
of
meeting
you.
-
Will
you
join
me
for
lunch?
-
Together?
-
Oh
my
God.
You're
the
sexiest
man
in
Rome,
-
Did
you
know?
-
Shall
we?
Thank
you.
Are
you
planning
a
large
family?
-
No
children.
You
become
their
slave.
Diapers,
school,
illness.
They
grow
up,
they
move
out,
-
No,
that's
not
so.
I
couldn't
wait
My
father
sold
drugs...
...my
mother
was
a
shoplifter.
What
could
I
do?
-
Look,
look!
There's
the
actor
Luchino
Salta.
-
Yes,
yes!
That's
him.
-
He's
married.

-
Are
you
okay?
-
I'm
fine.
-
I
can't
believe
I'm
having
lunch
with
you.
-
I'm
the
lucky
one.
-
Why
alone?
Aren't
you
married?
-
Yes,
but
marriage
is
like
wine.
When
it's
right,
it's
beautiful,
We're
separated.
The
press
doesn't
know.
-
Of
course.
I
won't
tell
anyone.
-
What
are
they
doing?
-
He's
looking
into
her
eyes
-
I'd
love
it
if
you
could
You
could
give
me
your
insights,
We
could
do
that
back
at
my
hotel.
-
You
value
my
opinion?
-
Is
there
something
wrong
with
that?
Antonio,
my
husband,
Which
may
be
a
bit
true.
-
He
doesn't
take
your
ideas
seriously?
-
He
takes
them
seriously.
...but
in
the
scientific
area.
I
teach
high
school
astronomy.
-
Oh
my,
how
sweet.
-
Yes,
so
I
doubt
he'd
want
my
opinion
Astronomy.
So,
the
skies,
You're
a...
wait,
don't
tell
me.
-
Please,
I'm
not
saying
anything!
-
You're
a
Libra.
-
No,
a
Sagittarius.
-
He's
taking
her
hand.
-
She
should
slap
his

-
Oh
no,
she
loves
it.

-
Are
you
hurt?
-
No.
No.

Oh

You're

And,
of

Thank
you.

And
Kierkegaard...

Didn't
you

that

Oh,

"You
must

your

Or
was
it

You're
so
sweet
to

that.

No,
no,

you

Okay,
I'll

I

I
feel
like
I

have
to
tell
Sally.

No,
no,
don't
say
that.
No,
no,
it
is,
it
is.
It's
wound
down.

I...
I
had
fantasies
yesterday
-
Really?
-
Exploring
Italy
and
looking
at
all
of
Milan
and
Venice
and
Naples.
You
could
teach
me.
-
I'm
a
good
teacher.
-
We
could
stay
in
little
towns
at
bed
and
breakfasts.
-
Since
Sally
is
taking
I
just
don't
want
to
break
this
-
No,
of
course.

Yeah,
but
right
after.
I
love
you.

definitely
better.

What
happened
to
you?

Did
it
go
well?

We're
going

But
we've
just
arrived.

don't
want
the
job.
We'll
never
get
rich,
You
loved
teaching
at
the
school.

But
nothing!
We'll
go
home.
We'll
have
a...
...a
better
life,
with
children.
And
maybe...
-
Okay.
What
a
surprise.
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
Let's
make
love.

Make
love?
