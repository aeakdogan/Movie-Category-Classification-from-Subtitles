You're

Ugh,

There's
this
moment
beforehand
that
I'm
not
nearly
as
well-liked
Tuck

Ugh,

You've

You're

When?

I'm
so
fucked.

Take
deep

Good.
It's
going
to
go
amazing.

Why?
You're

voice
of
our
generation.

a
lot
of
pressure.
Okay,
I'll
see
you
tonight.

Good

Hi.
I

ridiculously
late
for
my

Just
take
a
seat.

I

Ask
him.

Susan

She
told
me,
"The
one
thing
for
an
important
meeting."

Well...
No,
this
is...
this
is
tightly
paced.
Engaging
characters
It's...
But...
how
to
put
this?
Your
protagonist
Alan...
-
Alex.
I
don't
know
if
you
want
people
He's
kind
of
ambitious.
He's
kind
of
just
kind
of.
Susan
says
your
short
stories
But
it
seems
to
us
entirely
adapted
The
novel
requires
a
different
kind
Excuse
me
for
one
second.

Hey
hey!

Ah.
Question:
who
is
he?
He's
just,
uh...
just
a
kid.
Thanks
for
coming
in.

Rasheen.

Rasheen:
Where

Yes!
We're
getting
you
back
home
You're
not
my
responsibility.
Dude,
come
on.

Not
cool,
dude.
Hey,
can
we
stop
running?
So
look,
you're
obviously
But
whatever.
Don't
look
at
me
like
that.
a
very
important
meeting
I
think
I've
been
Now

She's

That
woman
on
the

like
Big

Big
Sister
-
That's
great.
Good
for
you.
Good
deeds.
It's
nice
to
know
there
are
still
-
They're
hard
to
find.
-
So,
uh,
what's
your
name?
-
That's
your
real
name?
I'm
assuming
it's
also
Yes,
sir.
Wow,
what
are
the
odds

So
great.
Sadly,
yes.
Okay,
that's
enough.
-
Thank
you
for
the
water.
You're
welcome.
Great,
so

the
time.
Oh,

I
am
so
sorry.
Wait,
this
is
Rasheen.
Oh.
Okay.
-
Hi,
Rasheen.
I'm
Annie.
You'll
explain
later?
-
Yeah.
Oh,
how
was
the
meeting?
Okay,
we'll
talk.
None
for
the
kid.
-
Man:
Hey,
Sam.
-
Hey.
-
Can
I
have
a
cookie?
You
can
have,
like,
10
cookies.
Go
crazy.
-
Hey.
-
What
the
fuck?
Rasheen,
this
is
my
cousin
We're
not
really
cousins.
Look,
he's
riveted.
I'm
just...
you
know,
And
you
thought,
alopecia
awareness
parties."
Kind
of.
-
Horrible.
He's
in
LA.
-
I
like
that
Charlie.
This
is
fishy.
Why
do
you
have
We're
going
to
mingle.
I'm
calling
you
tomorrow.
Annie:
Okay,
I
promise
It's
actually
just
with
the
people
that
I
love.
So
as
a
little
extra
dash
of
fun,
oh
I
don't
know..."follicle,"
-


Okay,
now
the
first
thing
most
people
notice
about
me
-
Man:
Whoo!
I
am
superhot.
I
am
also,
in
addition
And
unlike
some
of
the
hot
I
have
a
very
awesome
that
we're
all
going
The
word
"alopecia"
-

Uh,
could
everyone
please
-
I'm
really
sorry.
-
I
am
so
so
so
sorry.
-

I
need
a
drink.
Crowd:
Whoo!
-
Hey.
I
wish
you
were
here
I
got
Dave's
jeep
and
the
sun
is
about
to
set.
It
is
fucking
unbelievable!
-
How's
Dave
doing?
You
know
I
haven't
encountered
It's
like
a
no-mosquito
zone.
They're
outlawed
or
something.
Charlie,
come
home
right
now.
Huh?
Oh,
baby,
Charlie?
Charlie?
Annie:
-
Wait,
is
everyone
having
fun?
...how
much
things
cost.
-
Hey,
thanks.
-
Great
party.
I
never
noticed
-
Really?
I
never
mentioned
it?
-
Love
you.
#Remind
me
again
#When
you
walked
in
the
room
#When
I
was
lost
too
#
#But
in
my
own
thoughts
#Tell
me
your
story,
-
#
I
can
get
us
some
glasses...
#
#And
a
bottle
of
wine
#
#We
can
sit
on
the
carpet
#
#Sit
on
the
table
#You
can
reach
for
my
hand,
#Or
just
what
you
can't
stand
#
-
#
Be
a
boy
or
a
little
old
man...
#
#Be
what
you
want,
-
Say
cheese.
Ah.
Don't
worry.
Here,
let
me
try
this.

Did
you
have
a
rough
night?
I
got
a
question.
Um...
why
aren't
we
better
friends?
Um,
I
wasn't
aware
Oh,
I...
I
think
we
would
Well...
my
best
friend's
name
I
mean,
seriously,
can
a
girl
have
in
her
life?
Well,
you
can
call
me
Sam
2.


Sam
2
is
so
much
better."
Oh,
that
was
cheesy.
Help
me
out
with
-
You
work
in
legal,
right?
-
Seventh
floor.
Why
are
you
always
Oh,
come
on,
everybody
knows
Philanthropic
giving!

-
Annie:
Oh
God.
-
Can
you...
Oh,
that's
good.
-
One...
Got
it.
Annie:
Sorry.
Listen,
they're
going
get
you
back
home
If
they
ask
any
questions,
um,
just
tell
them
you've
been
You
know,
don't...
I
don't
want
to
get
It
was
nice
meeting
you.

So
Dave
thinks
he's
going
to
get
-
Mary
Catherine:
That's
great.
He
was
the
happiest
-

-
Yeah?
He
says
he
doesn't
I
knew
he'd
bail.
He
was
always
way
too
much
of
a
wimp
-
Do
you
want
to
know
what
I
want?
-
An
omelet.
Why
do
you
hate
Because
it's
the
epicenter
-
Wait.
Dave
told
me
this
awesome
thing
He
says
the
whole
town
and
whatever
you
bring
to
it...
It's
just
this
random
collection
and
it
basically
reflects
So
if
you're
happy,
LA
is
great.
If
you're
not,
LA
sucks.
But
it
has
nothing
to
do
because...
get
this...
there's
no
such
thing.
And?
And
that's
it.
If
you
don't
feed
me
soon,
Let's
go.
Okay,
what's
going
on?
Dave
said
what?
He
wants
to
partner
But...
we'd
have
to
be
out
there.
When?
End
of
the
month.
And
you
want
to
do
it?
What
I'm
missing,
I
think,
Like...
like
the
novel,
Where's
my...
-
I
don't
know.
I
mean
my
great
shame
is
that
I'm
just
this
suburban
kid
You
know,
carpooled...
-
You
know
what
I'm
saying?
I
mean
you...

You
got,
like,
tons
of
material
all
at
the
ripe
old
age
How
old
are
you
anyway?
I
don't
know.
You
don't
know
how
old
you
are?
When's
your
birthday?

What
are
you
so
afraid
of?
I'm
afraid
my
brain
I'm
afraid
we
will
never
I'm
afraid
we
won't
care
except
opening
and
Pilates
classes.
Yeah,
but
you
know
they'd
be,
There's
no
art
there.
-
That's
ridiculous.
New
York
has
everything...
the
best
restaurants,
Right,
and
how
many
museums
-
I'm
just
curious.
-
Yes,
that
is
the
point.
I
mean,
what
good
is
paying
if
we
never
We
might
as
well
live
somewhere
else
and
actually
do
things.
You
know,
hit
the
Met,
Carnegie
Deli.
"Wow,
that's
a
really
big
sandwich.
-
I
don't
know
if
I
can
eat
all
that."
You're
miserable
more
than
not.
Yes,
but
that
is
not
New
York
is...
Charlie:
What?
...home.
You're
asking
me
to
leave
home.
You
know
this
is
my
job,
I
have
to
sit
here
and
write
things.
It's...
it's
not
easy
Sorry
I
don't
have
a
television.
What's
your
thing?
You
like
art,
huh?
Really?
Here,
draw
yourself
a
television.

#So
I
have
under
two
minutes
#It's
quite
the
challenge
actually
#And
I
know
I'm
always
writing
#But
I
can
hardly
express
#'Cause
words
aren't
why
#And
I
don't
know
why
#There
was
a
message
in
a
bottle
#Somebody
mistook
rock
#So
their
letter
never
made
it
#I
had
to
fish
it
#And
I
know
you
won't
believe
me,
#The
letter
said
"I
love
you,
#That's
exactly
when
it
hit
me,
#'Cause
though
Sam:
Annie:
Are
you
sure
just
because
they're
No.
But
I
do
look
in
this
one.
Look
at
me.
I'm
like
a
dashing
Annie:
Oh.
Annie:
What
do
you
think
I
don't
know.
He
says
he
won't
go
back.
Well,
he's
supercute.
I'm
kidding.
-
Sam,
don't
keep
him.
Calm
down.
Sorry
about
the
ball.

Hello?
Okay.
No,
it's
not
like
I
didn't
So
that's
the
last
of
them,
huh?
No,
I'm,
uh...
I'm
fine.
-

Charlie:
Did
you
know
that
my
three
in
New
York
City
You
don't
need
Dave
to
do
something
great.
-
I
believe
in
you.
'Cause
you're
my
man.
You're
my
big,
funny,
We
don't
need
to
know
everything
You'll
figure
out
your
thing
That's
how
it
works.
No,
not
here.
Not
always.
I
just
want
to
feel
like
the
crap
I
don't
know.
Woman:
No
no,
yeah,
I
did.
I'm
just
tired.
-
Both:
Oh.
So
I'm...
I'm
generally
not
-
but
I
thought
you
might
like...
-
It's
a
school
night.
-
Bye.
Oh.
Two
ships,
two
ships.
-
Hey,
Beth.



-
What?
Why
did
you
want
I
just...
does
there
have
I
don't
know.
I
still...
Whatever.
Have
a
drink
with
me.

-
She
hated
me.
-
She
hated
me.
She
just
thought
Yeah
well,
I
couldn't
have
been
I...
I
brought
her
flowers.
Wow,
shocking
that
-
Nothing
would
have.
She
didn't
want
me
to
get
hurt.
But
I
guess
in
fairness,
you
know,
Oh
no,
wait.
-
Come
on.
I
fuckin'
hate
that.
I
can
handle
your
mother
I
can't
stand
the
thought
-
Hey.
-
You're
back.
-
Mississippi.
-
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I?
-
How's
your
little
brother?
-
The
kid?
Yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah.
Well,
it's
great
that
you
do
that.
You
know,
you're...
-
Am
I?
I've
been
watching
you
-
You're
good.
I
must
be
a
really
good
actress
because
I
fucking
hate
my
job.
-
You're
an
actress?
What
do
you
do
-
I
sing.
-
Yeah,
songs.
Cabaret.
-
What
do
you
do?
-
Words?
So
you
sing.
Well,
you
come
listen
No,
I...
I
could
never
-
Why
not?
That
makes
no
sense.
You
happy
to
see
me?
I
don't
know
yet.

This
is
bad.
I
have
to
work
in
the
morning.
-
Some
people
work.
Playing
bass
in
a
shitty
band
and
considering
applying
You
think
the
band
is
shitty?
Well,
you
were
front
row
I
was
your
girlfriend.
That,
like,
contractually
obligated
me
Yeah,
but
you
always...
you
just
looked
like
you
were
I
was.
I
did.
All
right,
let's
do
this.
When,
Mississippi,
and
come
to
New
York
City?
-
When
I
was
17.
So
you've
been
here,
-
Aw,
nice.
Oh,
it's
here...

-
Drink
this.
Yes,
ma'am.
Mm!
What
the
fuck,
man?
Why
won't
you
come
-
You
really
want
to
know?
Because
I
once
dated
who
desperately
wanted
I
mean
it
was
all
she
talked
about.
And
I
finally
went
Bad?
So
unburdened
with
talent
-
I
mean
I
had
to
break
up
with
her.
No,
I
didn't
care
It
was...
she
so
believed
she
was
good
wow,
this
girl
doesn't
And
I
think
you're
terrific.
Therefore,
I
could
never
because
it'll
change
everything
-
What
if
I'm
amazing?
-
What
if
you
suck
as
a
writer?
Whoa,
you
are
bad
news.
Sammy,
I'm
calling
you
and
I'm
about
to
fall
It
happens,
right?
Okay,
I'm
going
to
take
that
the
universe
wants
me
I'll
call
you
tomorrow

Fuck!
What's
wrong?
-
I
got
bad
news
today.
I'm
a
fuckin'
failure.
Aw.
Fuck,
I
was
impressive
once.
I'm
telling
you,
parent-teacher
conferences
I
was
unstoppable.
-
Little
Sammy
Wexler.
-
Yeah.
It's
okay
to
not
I
always
want
to...
I
don't
always
have
to
be
talking.
You
gotta
stop
me
I'm
just
gonna
keep
going.
Shh.


This
way.
Come.
Wait
wait,
shh!
Listen,
there
might
be
sleeping
on
my
couch,
Might?
There's
definitely
sleeping
on
my
couch,
Okay.
Shh
shh!
-
Look
look,
it's
my
bedroom.
-
How
nice
is
it
in
here?

something

Is
that
what
this
is?

I
made
a
New
Year's
resolution.
To
not
be
such
a
whore.
How's
that
been
going
for
you?
Well...
-
Come

All
I
know
is
you've

don't...
I
don't
think
you
should
spend
You

I
think
you
should

an
extra
set
of
keys.
I
knew

last
shot

Look,
I
totally
agree...
So

Yeah.

No.
You've

that
I've
never
even
thought
this
before,
No,

like
the
worst
idea
ever.
Hey

what
could
happen?
We

odds

there
in
the
living
room.
Is

real?
-
Yeah.

Isn't
it
going
to
be
awkward?
This
is...
you're
not
going
Yes,
I
will.
I
do.
Yeah,
now
you
do
Are
you
going
to
be
drunk
-
Possibly.
You're
going
to
move
in
What
are
you
doing?
Making
it
official.
-
Paperwork.
Terms.
Hey.
I
don't
get
to
weigh
in

Okay,
fine.
If
I'm
going
to
stay
here
I
need
you
to
be
nice.
Okay.
But
I'm
going
to
need
you
Sam...
I've
been
feeling
I
need
you
to
be
nice.
Okay.
Sign

myself?
-
Come

You
can

seconds

You're
worried
you're
going
But
aren't
we
past
all
that?
We
should
just...
It's
a
bad
idea.
Look...
I'm
kind
of
seeing
someone
which
I...
because
we
can't
get
too
into
it,
But
we're
not
exclusive,
so
you
and
I
can
still,
Ann.

Always
making
me
the
bad
guy.


5206?
Sam:
5208.
-
Damn
it.
I
thought
I
had
-
Are
you
working
tonight?
-
Oh
great.
Where?
What
time
are
you
done?
Okay,
great.
So,
um,
I
gotta
get
some
keys
made
-
Bye.

Sam:
Hey.
-
Did
that
girl
leave?
-
Did
she
say
anything?
You
like
French
toast?
-
Yeah.
All
right,
let's
make
some.
We'll
get
all
Kramer
v.
Kramer.
Hey.
You
okay?

Can
I,
uh...
can
I...

-
Weren't
you
wearing
that
yesterday?
Sure,
yeah.

Ugh!
He's
a
fucking
29-year-old
That's
what
he
is.
If
there's
a
29-year-old
12-year-old
I
will
find
that
motherfucker
It's
my
one
gift.
And
they
never
call.
"Hey,
what's
going
on?
You
wanna
come
over
and
fuck?"

I'm
so
sick
of
optimism.
It's
fucking
exhausting.
Listen.
Why
do
you
give
a
shit
Ira...
You
should
give
a
shit
And
I
think
you're
one
of
the
greats.
Everyone
who
loves
you
-
Okay?
Are
you
listening
to
me?
-
Now
get
out
there
and...
...philanthropic
give.
That
was
an
uplifting
lunch
hour.
We're
dealing
-
This
is
getting
ridiculous.
Hey,
Ann.
You
don't
have
to
Yeah,
the
world
will
love
a
bald
girl
Bye.
You
know,
I'm
not
crazy
-
Why?
That
makes
me
down.
-
It's
not
about
you.
It's
just
nothing.
Yeah
well,
what
about
the
one
-
I
do
love
nerds.
Well,
Chuck,
if
you
find
Christmas
is
right
around
I
just
don't
know
what
you're
trying

That's
perfect.
Are
you
going
to
throw
a
jacket
Grumpy.
Okay,
this...
awesome.
And
you
know
the
Clash?
Dude,
you
don't
know
I
have
so
much
to
teach
you.



Hi,
Sam.
Remember
me?
Um,
just
wanted
to
remind
you
I...
I
promise
not
to
suck.
No
pressure.
I
never
heard
from
you
I
don't
know.
Okay,

Hi.
Hi.
I'm
here.
I
can
see
that.
I
don't
know
why
exactly.
You
didn't
want
to
get
sued.
Right?
Oh.
-
Hi.
So
I
just
had
a
little
talk
I
asked
about
you
being
He
had
no
idea
Okay.
Okay,
wait.
He
said
you
met
on
the
subway.
Hold...
hold...
hold...
hold
on.
-
Just
wait.
He
got
separated
from
his...
-
How
old
is
he?
-
He
doesn't
know
either.
oh
my
God,
What?
No!
He's
been
in
seven
I...
I
think
something
was
going
on.
-
Why
didn't
you
go
to
the
police?
Look,
I...
I
realize
but
I
don't
know
what
else
to
do.
I'm
just...
I'm
letting
him
stay
here
-
How
long
has
he
been
here?
You
find
a
child
on
the
subway
just
keep
him
here
without
letting
-
That's...
while
you
were
out
No,
he
was
fine.
He
just
knocked
him
right
out.
I
have
the
worst
taste
in
men.

Sorry.
Hold
on.
It's
okay,
honey.
Hey,
um,
can
you...
I'm
not
good
with
blood.
Congratulations,
Sam.
You've
just
become
the
most
Hey.
Hey
hey
hey.
-
You're
really
leaving?
-
Why?
-
He's
totally
mellow.
You...
You
have
to
let
someone
-
I
will.
-
He's...
I
can't
get
involved
with
this
I'm
trying
to
get
my
life
together,
Look,
I'm
sorry
that
I
lied
to
you.
I'm
a
good
person.
-
I'm
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
here.
-
For
now,
until
I
can...
What,
you
don't
need
a
project?
I'm
a
mess
too.
Trust
me.
So
let's...
let's
clean
each
other
up.
Bye,
Sam.

-
Sam:
Come
home
soon.
Sorry.
-
Hey.
-
Why
is
he
still
with
you?
Well,
I
talked
to
my
friend
Jill,
and
according
to
New
York
state
law,
Are
you
okay?
Is
he
feeding
you?
-
What
are
you
eating?
Look,
I
get
that
this
is
Sensitive
white
guy
learns
life
lessons
-
You
actually
think
that
I'm...
This
is
a
big
deal.
You
can't
just
keep
him.
You
need
to
let
someone
Look
at
these.
I'm
anxious
to
see
if
I
give
him
more
than
two
pens
Come
on.
Please
fix
this.
And
then
she's
going
to
call
my
mom
and
I
don't
have
the
energy.
It's
okay.
Okay.
-
I
think
you're
good.
-
Hey,
Rasheen,
say
thank
you.
Thank
you.
Come
on,
let's
go.
-
Hey,
Sam.
-
You've
spent
time
in
Los
Angeles.
-
Do
you
like
it?
Would
you
ever
want
No.
Okay.
Come
on.
Go.
People
shouldn't
be
able
The
man's
made
He
just
makes
too
many
of
them.
One
every
year?
Take
some
time
off
spend
a
little
quality
time
Get
out
there,
live
a
little,
you
know?
-
Marry
me.
-
Let's
get
married.
Marry
me,
baby.
-
Be
my
wife.
I'm
serious.
I'm
sorry.
Yes.
So?
-
You
want
to
marry
me?
Marriage.
-
I'm
not
buying
it.
-
There's
something
off
about
this.
Did
you...
did
this
just
occur
to
you,
-
"Let's
get
married"?
I've
been
giving
it
and
I
think
we
should
do
it.
Uh-huh.
Well,
I
will.
I
mean
you
will...
get
one.
I
didn't
know
you'd
be
Come
on,
Mary
Catherine,
we're
not
those
people.
Just
say
yes.
If
we're
not
those
people,
We
make
fun
of
married
people.
And
didn't
I
tell
you,
I
didn't
think
I
should
-
That
I
come
from
a
long
line...
-
Both:
of
divorced
people.
I'm
not
genetically
wired
for
it
So
why
this?
Love.
Huh.
Wow.
You
really
want
out,
don't
you?
So
I'm
trying
to
let
go
that
we
have
to
pay
for
our
joy
that
there
has
to
be
But
it
sure
feels
that
way.
Mm,
absolutely.
You're
really
smart.
I
do
this
thing...
I
can't
believe
I'm
telling
you
this.
Oh,
come
on,
come
on,
Anytime
you
want
just
let
me
know.
Okay,
um...
about
a
year
ago,
and
the
cab
driver,
this
Indian
guy,
he
started
telling
me
He...
he
was
just
looking
at
me
and
he
said,
"Bliss...
And
I
was
like,

And
he
said,
"You
have
The
key
to
your
life
is
gratitude.
And
I
said,
And
he
said,
"Simple.
And
I
said,
"Well,
when?"
And
he
said,
"All
the
time.
And
he
said
after
I
say
"thank
you,"
-
Wait.
"Thank
you.
More
please"?
That
with
gratitude
the
universe
So
I've
been
giving
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
More
please.
Thank
you.
-
How
crazy
am
I
sounding
here?
No,
not
at
all.
Have...
have
you
noticed
-
No.
I
mean
yes,
but
whatever.
Anyway,
what
got
you
Oh,
I
wouldn't...
I
wouldn't
What
would
you
call
it?
-
Well,
taking
pictures,
I
guess.
Well,
why
do
you
take
pictures?
Um,
I
don't
know.
When
I...
when
I
see
I
get
to
keep
looking
at
it.
You
shouldn't
be
flattered
-
Why?
The
men
I
fall
for
And
if
I'm
here,
I
like
having
you
here.
Well,
that's
nice.
For
the
record
-
You
should
trust
me.
Because
someone
has
to.
There
was...
when
I
was
in
the...
and
we
all
got
these
pictures
that,
you
know,
and
we
were
supposed
to,
And
so
I
colored
Santa's
clothes
and
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Porter,
ugh,
she
was
just
this
miserable
She
grabbed
my
paper
and
she
held
it
up
to
the
class
"Samuel
here
colored
And
we
all
know
And
she
ripped
up
the
paper,
gave
me
a
new
one
-
Mrs.
Porter!
So
I
ran
home
I
told
my
parents
what
happened.
And
my
dad...
my
dad
came
to
school
He
barged
and
he
started
screaming
"Who
says
Santa's
pants
-
Yes!
Go,
Dad!
-
That
was
awesome.
And
that
was
like
a...
that
was
like
a
battle
cry

-
Yeah,
who
says?
So
that
was
awesome.
What
about
your
dad?
-
Uh,
he's
great.
-
Yeah,
he's
the
best.
-
This
is
me.
-
Wow.
-
This
was
nice.
-
Thank
you.
More
please?
Right.
I'll
see
you
at
work.
-
See
ya.
Dude.
This
is
really
good.
-
Sam?
You're
my
best
friend.
Thanks,
man.
You're
mine
too.
So
how
can
I
help
you?
Well,
I
have
some
questions
Okay.
Uh...
Well,
I
might
be
interested
or
on
or
whatever.
-
Okay.
Are
you
married?
-
Job?
But
I
should
tell
you
I
don't
but
I'm
interested
in
taking
someone
in
He's
been
staying
with
me
and
I
think
Wait,
you
have
this
child
Yeah.
A
child
who
was
in
foster
care
Yeah,
but
he...
And
he's
living
with
you,
Why
is
that?
And
where
is
this
child
right
now
No
no
no
no.
No.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
a
writer
and
I
just...
you
know,
I...
I
had
some
questions
Mr.
Wexler,
I'm
sorry,
there's
been...
it's
fine.
Mr.
Wexler?
He
looks
like
he
should
be
at
birthday
parties.
Why
do
I
have
to
be
You
don't
have
to
do
anything.
I
want
you
to
be
happy.
And
his
name's
Sam.
And
this
coming
from
the
guy
with
belly
button
rings
-
That
is
outrageous!
-
doing
spinning
classes.
And
I'm
sure
Alabama
is
a
homely
-
Mississippi.

Sammy,
you
said
you
were
going
to
deal
Everyone's
getting
worried.
I
know.
I'm...
I
will.
It's...
-
Hi.
Um,
Mississippi,
Annie.
-
And
I'm
not
famous?
-
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you.
So,
uh,
you're
from
Mississippi?
Yep.
What's
that
like?
I'm
just
talking
-
Okay.
Bye.

-
Oh,
hey.
-
I
didn't
see
you
sit
down.
Mary
Catherine:
-
the
first
night
we
kissed?
I
was
wearing
It
was
way
too
fancy
but
I
thought
I
could
pull
it
off.
You
know,
like,
Just
threw
this
on.
You
came
and
met
us.
I
was
all
excited
to
see
you.
And
you
sat
down
-
You
really
don't
remember
this?
You
looked
at
the
dress
"Where
are
you
going,
prom?"
I'm
sorry.
No,
it
was
perfect
because
finally
here
he
was...
the
guy
who
wouldn't
let
me
I
always
thought
of
that
Like,
oh,
there
you
were.
And
now...
it's
like
you're
out
of
focus
ever
since
you
got
back...
And
I'm...
just
sad
to
see
you
go,
I
don't
know
if
I'm
going
to
go.
Yes,
you
do.
Make
sure
you
get
there
I'm
going
to
try
but
it
gets
kind
of
crowded
-
So
get
there
kind
of
early.
Okay.
Are
you
sure
you
know
Uh,
the
city's
on
a
grid,
I'm
so
excited.
-
I'm
totally
excited.
-
Okay.
Bye.
See
you
tonight.
-
Ah.
What
do
we
say
if
she's
terrible?
Tell
her
she
looked
pretty.
That's
a
great
idea,
my
friend.
We're
going
to
do
that.
(police
siren
chirps,
-
Officer:
Sam
Wexler?
Sam:
What...
what's...
You
have
the
right
Anything
you
say
can
and
will
be
used
-
What's
going
on?
All
right,
what's
going
to
happen...
If
you
refuse
that
right,
Okay
okay.
He
didn't
do
anything
bad.

Hey.
I
want
you
to
read
I
don't
want
you
Just...
just
keep
doing
it,
okay?
-
Promise
me.
And
I'll
come
to
one
and
I
won't
be
able
you'll,
like,
sketch
something
and
that'll
be
-
Okay.

Sam?
Sam.
#One
and
one
#The
lily
grew
#
-
#
Between
the
snow...
#
#I
thought
you
knew
#I
thought
you
knew,
#Under
cover
we
read
plays
#
#Molire,
#Robespierre,
#No

#My
love,

Mary
Catherine:
stay
here
with
me
I
want
you
to
be
happy,
I
am
not
going
to
be
the
person
and
shackles
you
to
a
city
Oh
God.
Oh
God,
like
some
sort
of
when
it
should
be
But
I'm
totally
freaked
out
-
and
you're
my
best
friend...
...in
the
whole
world
and...
Will
you
breathe?
-
Please
please.

Good.
That's
good.
Now
tell
me
what
is
going
on.
I
can't.
I'm
afraid
of
what
will
happen
You
can
say
anything
to
me.
You
threw
a
vase
at
my
head
-
and
I
stuck
around,
didn't
I?
Fuck
yeah,
I
ducked.
That's
what
I'm
saying.
Whisper
it
to
me.
I
will
live
wherever
you
want.
-
I'll
move
to
LA.
-
We
can
move
to
Los
Angeles.
-
Fuck
it.
Let's
move
to
Poland.
Beirut!
I
don't
care.

Did
you
get
my
message?
I
got
12
of
them.
Look,
I...
I
don't
know
I
don't
care
that
Well,
what...
what
I
want
you
to
go
away!
You're
making
me
sad,
okay?
You
know
how
long
A
week.
One
week.
I
mean
we
were
playing
house
I'm
sorry
about
Rasheen,
but
what
did
you
expect
I
realized
the
problem.
You
write
short
stories
and
I
think
you
like
But
I'm
kind
of
ready
Sam
#2:
Okay,
what
are
we
feeling,
-
Sam?
We
need
to
talk.

You
mean
the
talk
but
you
can't
get
involved
and
you're
damaged

I
refuse
to
have
that
talk.
Now
would
you
like
red
Sam...
look,
I...
I'm
not...
What?
Are
you
happy?
No,
I'm
not
happy.
I
could
make
you
happy.
Seriously,
let
me
love
you.
I
am
totally
up
to
the
task.
Actually,
I've
already
started.
-
I
can't...
I
can't
do
this.
Don't...
come
on,
don't
walk
out
Please.
Look
at
me.
I
get
it,
okay?
I
get
it.
I'm
not
the
guy
you
had
in
mind.
But
what
if
you
don't
know
-
And
you
do?
Where
did
you
come
from,
Westchester.
Do
you
want
to
know
why
The
first
time
I
saw
you...
God,
I
thought,
"Wow!
Her...
the
girl
I
want
to
be
near
that
girl."
Trust
me,
I
don't
but
I
am
gone
over
you.
-
Stop,
okay?
Shut
the
fuck
up.
Just
stop,
please.
Just
stop.
You
can
hear
this.
-
Close
your
eyes.
I
just
want
you
to
listen
to
me.
Humor
me,
please?

It's
not
easy
to
be
adored.
You
in
particular...
you
have
I
get
that.
Think
of
it
as
an
experiment.
I
promise
I
will
be
very
wonderful
It's
an
area
where
I
think
I've
got

You're
worth
the
adoration,
Annie.
You're
worth
it.
And
the
fact
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
It
is
true
for
me
and
that
is
all
that
matters.

#I
was
sleeping
in
the
lilies
#
#Or
was
I
up
all
night?
#
#These
days
it's
hard
to
tell
Charlie:
Wexler!
#We
were
loving
#Or
were
we
in
a
fight?
#
This
writer
that
I
know
He
said
every
five
years
what
an
asshole
he
was
Every
five
years,
"Man,
I
was
such
an
asshole
So
if
we
accept
this,
we
think
and
feel
in
five
years
-
This
conversation?
We're
going
to
hate
-
I
hate
it
now.


Did
you
play
sports
Yeah.
You
remember
"Walk
it
off"?
No
matter
what
happened,
right?
I
mean
your
eyeball
could
be,
Coach
would
run
over,
"Eh,
you're
all
right,
kid.
Yeah.
And
I'm
sure
a
few
of
those
times
But
just
having
this
concept...
as
a
way
to,
I
don't
know,
I
just
walked
that
shit
off.
I've
been
feeling
lately
than
I
had
thought.
But
who
knows?
Maybe
I'll
feel
differently
Who
knows?

Automated
voice:
Hello.
Please
leave
a
message

All
right,
I'm
guessing
but
you're
sad
But
I
have
a
tale
to
tell,
Samuel,
So
listen
up.
The
scene:
dinner
with
#2.
Trying
to
cut
him
loose.
So
get
this.
You
know
how
people
say
Well,
that's
total
bullshit.
Beauty
is
on
the
outside,
I
mean
who
doesn't?
But
here's
the
crazy
thing,
I'm
listening
to
Sam
#2.
Listening
because
he
made
me
And
he's
making
a
total
case
And
as
he's
talking,
must
have
because
I
open
my
eyes
I
am
in
front
of
the
most
beautiful,
like,
a
total
hottie.
And
who
knew?
Sammy
2.
And
you
were
right,
by
the
way.
So
here's
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
Sadness
be
gone.
Let's
be
people
who
deserve
Because
we
are
worthy.
You've
been
telling
me
that
for
years

You're
a
good
man,
Go
get
yourself
loved.
That's
all
I
got.

#Hey,
Jo
Jo
#
#Yeah,
I
know
your
name...
#
Jill.
Hey,
it's
Sam
Wexler.
I
think
Mary
Catherine
#Thought
I
saw
you
They
moved
him

#Could
be
as
well...
#
-
Thank
you.
#Oh
no,
I
cannot
tell.
#
Okay,
this...
this
last
song...
it's
a
happy
song
It's
kind
of
what
I
need
Thanks,
y'all.

I've

now

oh

more
to

put
a

oh

got

to
go
#
#Someone's

ain't
nothing
#I
found
a

#I
found
the

oh

#I
found
a

#Someone's
alone,

like
a
