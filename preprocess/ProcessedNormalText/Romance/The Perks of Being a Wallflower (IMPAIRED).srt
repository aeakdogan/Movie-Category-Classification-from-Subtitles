Dear
Friend...
I
am
writing
to
you
because
...and
didn't
try
to
sleep
with
...even
though
you
could
have.
Please
don't
try
to
...I
don't
want
you
to
do
that.
I
just
need
to
know
that
Like
if
you
met
me,
...the
weird
kid
who
spent
And
I
wouldn't
make
you
nervous.
I
hope
it's
okay
for
me
to
think
that.
You
see,
I
haven't
really
talked
to
But
tomorrow
is
my
first
...and
I
need
to
turn
things
around.
So,
I
have
a
plan.
As
I
enter
the
school
for
the
first
time...
...I
will
visualize
what
it
will
be
like
on
Unfortunately,
I
counted,
and
that's...
Hop,
freshman
toads.
...1385
days
from
now.
Worked
out
all
summer.
You
know,
Just
1385
days.
In
the
meantime,
I'd
hoped
that
my
...would
have
let
me
eat
Seniors
only.
What
are
you
doing
I
don't
want
to
bring
back
silverware.
Derek,
you're
Earth
Club
Treasurer.
When
my
sister
said
no...
...I
thought
maybe
my
old
friend
Susan
In
middle
school,
Susan
...now
she
doesn't
like
And
then
there's
Brad
Hays.
Before
my
brother
went
to
...he
and
Brad
played
together.
So,
I
thought
maybe
he'd
say
hi
to
me.
But
Brad's
a
senior
and
I'm
me,
On
the
bright
side,
...make
fun
of
the
teacher
He
even
drew
on
Mr.
Callahan's
The
prick
punch
is
not
a
toy.
I
learned
that
back
in
'Nam
in
'68.
"Callahan,"
the
sergeant
said...
..."you
put
down
that
prick
And
you
know
what
happened?
That
prick
punch
killed
my
best
friend
I
heard
you
were
gonna
be
in
my
class.
Are
you
proud
to
be
a
senior
having
to
Look.
My
name
is
Patrick.
Either
you
call
me
Patrick
Okay,
Nothing.
I
felt
really
bad
for
Patrick.
He
wasn't
saying
the
impersonation
He
was
just
trying
to
make
us
Nothing,
why
don't
you
read
first?
Alright.
Chapter
1.
Surviving
your
fascist
shop
teacher,
Oh,
wow.
This
is
useful
guys.
My
last
class
of
the
...and
I'm
really
excited
to
finally
learn
Nice
Trapper
Keeper,
faggot.
Believe
it
or
not
she's
gotten
I'm
Mr.
Anderson.
I'm
going
to
be
your
This
semester,
we're
going
to
be
learning
Genius
book.
Now,
who'd
like
to
get
out
I'm
shocked.
Alright.
...if
you
tell
me
which
author
Anyone?
He
was
British.
He
also
invented
the
serial.
In
fact,
at
the
end
of
...he
had
a
man
hanging
Hence,
the
term
cliffhanger.
Anybody?
-
Yeah.
That's
a
great
guess,
but
no,
Anybody
else?
The
author...
...is
Charles
Dickens.
However,
if
you
and
I
...it
would
have
cost
us
4
pennies.
Can
you
imagine
that?
We
would
have
put
those
...the
ushers
would
lock
in
the
office.
And
that's
where
we
get
the
term...
Cash
register.
I'll
give
you
a
free
"A"
on
anything
till
Box
office.
You
should
learn
to
participate.
Why
didn't
you
raise
your
hand?
They
call
you
teacher's
pet?
Freak?
That
kind
of
things?
I
used
to
get
spaz.
You
know,
I
heard
But
they
say
if
you
make...
...one
friend
on
your
first
day,
Thank
you,
sir.
But
if
my
English
teacher
is
...that
would
be
sort
of
depressing.
Yeah.
I
could
see
that.
Don't
worry,
Mr.
Anderson.
Thanks.
I
would
happily
not
take
shop...
Hey,
Freshman
Toad.
Well,
I
have
1384
days
to
go.
Just
so
I
say
it
to
someone...
...high
school
is
even
If
my
parents
ask
me
about
it,
...because
I
don't
want
them
to
If
my
Aunt
Helen
were
still
here,
And
I
know
she
would
understand
...and
I'm
still
trying
to
I
just
hope
I
make
a
friend
soon.
Love
always,
Charlie.
Charlie,
come
on.
This
chicken
paprikash
is
delicious.
Thank
you,
Derek.
He
was
a
little
nervous
about
...so
I
made
it
for
him.
You
feel
a
little
silly
about
Yes,
sir.
I
do
I
told
you.
Just
give
'em
a
smile
and
be
yourself.
-
That's
how
you...
You're
cruisin'
for
a
bruisin'
Freshman
year
is
tough,
but...
...you
really
find
yourself.
Thanks,
Derek.
You
know,
you
could
be
I'm
sorry.
The
kid's
a
pussy.
-
I
really
hope
you
love
the
mix
tape
I
made.
-
The
cover
is
hand-painted.
Hey,
Charlie,
you
want
this?
Are
you
sure?
He
gives
me
one
every
week.
Hey,
Babe.
...but
it
reminded
me
of
your
eyes.
Did
you
already
do
the
term
paper
Let's
go,
Devils!
Come
on.
-
Hey,
Nothing.
Oh,
suck
it,
virginity
pledges!
Suck
it!
Hey,
Patrick.
Hey!
You're
in
my
shop
class,
right?
How's
your
clock
coming?
My
dad's
building
it
for
me.
Yeah.
Mine
looks
like
a
boat.
You
wanna
sit
over
here,
Oh,
no,
no,
I'll
sit.
Thanks
for
not
calling
It's
an
endless
nightmare.
And
these
assholes,
-
So,
uh...
do
you
like
football?
Maybe
you
know
my
brother,
then.
Hey,
Sam.
Question.
Could
the
bathrooms
here
Yes,
they
call
it
the
men's
room.
So,
I
finally
got
hold
of
Bob.
Party
tonight?
He's
still
trying
to
shag
that
Oh,
he's
never
tossing
that
salad.
Come
on!
Patrick!
-
Yeah.
This
is...
-
Charlie...
Kelmeckis.
-
Your
sister's
dating
Pony
Tail
Derek,
isn't
she?
Is
that
what
they
call
him?
Would
you
leave
Pony
Tail
Derek
alone?
You
put
the
"ass"
in
"class,"
Patrick.
I
try,
Sam.
I
try.
It's
nice
to
meet
you,
Charlie.
So,
Sam,
what's
the
plan?
Nope.
She
got
caught
watering
down
Let's
just
go
to
Kings.
Alright.
We're
going
to
Kings
Do
you
have
a
favorite
band?
Well,
I
think
The
Smiths
are
my
favorite.
Are
you
kidding?
The
best
breakup
band
ever.
Asleep.
I
heard
it
on
Pony
Oh,
that
works
on
so
many
levels.
I
can
make
you
guys
a
copy
if
you
want.
What
about
Eide's?
Yeah,
of
course.
Not
a
band,
Charlie.
It's
a
record
store
downtown.
I
think
it
sounds
You
know,
I
used
to
be
popular
So,
you
should
be
careful.
That's
okay.
-
Hey,
Nothing.
Let
it
go!
Jesus!
It's
over!
So,
what
are
you
gonna
do
Well,
My
Aunt
Helen
said
I
don't
know
what
I'd
write
about.
-
You
could
write
about
us.
Call
it
Slut
and
The
Falcon.
Make
us
solve
crimes.
You
guys
seem
really
happy
together.
How
long
have
you
been
He's
not
my
boyfriend.
My
mom
finally
left
my
worthless
dad
and
But
She's
not
bitter
or
anything.
Absolutely
not.
Charlie,
I'm
not
a
bulimic.
I'm...
I'm
sorry.
She
just
really
believes
in
bulimia.
I
love
bulimia.
Hey,
thanks
for
paying,
Charlie.
Oh,
no
problem.
Maybe
I'll
see
you
around
in
school?
God,
would
you
turn
that
down?
So
be
it!
-
Bye,
Charlie.
Okay.
Bye.
Your
mom
says
Don't
go
-
Don't
go
to
Columbia...
Do
you
always
want
to
-
I
am
not
a
mama's
boy.
Because
Every
single
time
I
go
to
Shut
up,
Candace!
...and
you
stand
there
Charlie,
Charlie,
just
go.
Just
don't
wake
up
mom
and
dad.
Hey,
look
who's
here.
Welcome
home,
Aunt
Helen!
Oh.
Look
at
you
guys,
Candace...
...what
are
you
doing?
Look,
I
egged
him
on.
You
saw
it.
And
I
promise
you
he'll
Like
Aunt
Helen's
boyfriends?
Charlie,
this
is
Pony
Tail
Derek.
I
can
handle
him.
Do
you
trust
me?
Please,
don't
tell
mom
and
dad.
Oh,
my
God.
Holy
shit.
Holy
shit.
Living
room
routine?
Living
room
routine!
-
Yes!
-
Excuse
us!
Excuse
me!
-
Pardon
me.
Get
out
of
the
way!
God,
it's
freezing.
Ho,
but
you
wore
that
toasty
costume.
It's
not
like
it's
cute
or
original
Yeah,
piss
off,
Tennessee
Tuxedo.
Are
you
sure
it's
okay
that
I
come?
Yeah,
of
course.
-
Bob's
not
paranoid.
Sam...
...that
waitress
from
the
Olive
Garden,
Will
you
marry
me?
-
Only
with
Patrick's
blessing.
You're
a
hopeless
stoner
who
So,
I'm
gonna
have
to
say
-
Charlie?
So,
Charlie...
this
is
a
party.
This
is
what
fun
looks
like.
Are
you
ready
to
meet
Here,
have
a
seat.
Hey,
ladies,
meet
Charlie.
-
Hi.
Hey.
-
Mary
Elizabeth.
Nice
to
meet
you.
This
is
Charlie's
first
party
ever.
So,
I
expect
nice,
meaningful,
heartfelt
-
Patrick,
you're
such
a
dick.
The
dance
was
a
little
boring,
You're
so
selfish.
You
could
have
told
someone.
Cry
me
a
river.
How
is
it
that
you've
got
meaner
Just
lucky
I
guess.
No,
you're
doing
-
Or
something
very
right.
Hey!
Look
who's
here!
Is
that
Brad
Hays?
Yeah.
He
comes
here
sometimes.
But
he's
a
popular
kid.
Then,
what
are
we?
Oh,
Charlie,
you
look
like
Thank
you.
I
was
so
hungry
at
the
dance.
...but
I
didn't
really
have
any
time.
Thanks.
Have
you
guys
felt
this
carpet?
This
carpet
feels
so
darn
good.
Charlie.
Charlie,
what
do
you
High
school?
Bullshit.
Cafeteria
is
called
the
Nutrition
Center.
People
wear
their
letter
jackets
And
why
do
they
give
out
It's
not
a
sport,
we
all
know
it.
This
kid
is
crazy.
Mary
Elizabeth,
I
think
you're
really
...haircut
when
you
I'm
really
sorry.
-
God!
Shut
up!
Bob,
did
you
get
him
stoned?
Come
on,
Sam.
How
do
you
feel,
Charlie?
I
just
really
want
a
milkshake.
Sam...
...you
have
such
pretty
brown
eyes.
The
kind
of
pretty
that
deserves
You
know
what
I
mean?
Okay,
Charlie.
What
a
great
word.
Milkshake.
It's
like
when
you
say
your
name
...and
after
awhile,
it
sounds
crazy.
So,
I'm
guessing
No.
No,
no,
no.
My
best
friend
Michael.
So,
he
hated
all
that
stuff.
Parties,
too.
Well,
where
is
Michael
tonight?
Oh,
he
shot
himself
last
May.
Kinda
wished
he'd
left
a
note.
Where's
the
bathroom?
-
It's
up
the
stairs.
You're
so
nice.
Charlie.
Weird.
Oh!
Charlie?
-
Who
is
that
kid?
Relax.
He's
a
friend
of
mine.
Stay
here.
I
didn't
see
anything.
Yeah,
I
know
you
saw
Okay,
listen...
Brad
doesn't
want
anyone
to
know.
Wait...
-
Are
you
baked?
That's
what
Bob
said.
And
how
you
can't
have
3
on
a
And
everyone
laughed,
Okay,
Charlie,
listen.
I
need
you
to
promise...
...that
you're
not
gonna
say
Okay?
Our
little
secret.
Agreed.
Okay.
Thank
you.
We'll
talk
later.
I
look
forward
to
that
big
talk.
Isn't
this
the
best
milkshake
ever,
Alice?
It's
even
better
than
the
first
one.
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
Charlie
just
told
me
that
I
don't
think
he
has
any
friends.
Hey.
Everyone.
Everybody.
Everyone.
Raise
your
glasses
to
Charlie.
-
What
did
I
do?
We
just
wanna
toast
to
our
new
friend.
You
see
things.
And
you
understand.
You're
a
wallflower.
What
is
it?
What's
wrong?
I
didn't
think
anyone
noticed
me.
Well,
we
didn't
think
there
was
So,
Come
on,
everyone.
-
To
Charlie.
Welcome
to
the
island
of
misfit
toys.
-
Oh,
my
God.
What
is
this
song!?
Have
you
ever
heard
this
before?
Never.
Patrick,
We've
gotta
-
Sam,
it's
freezing.
No.
Mama
Patrick
says
no.
Patrick.
Patrick,
it's
Sam.
-
...I'm
begging
you
to...
What
is
she
doing?
Don't
worry.
Turn
it
up!
You
got
it,
your
highness.
What?
I
feel
infinite.
Dear
Friend...
I'm
sorry
I
haven't
written
for
awhile,
but
For
example,
I
am
trying
to
participate...
...by
listening
to
Sam's
collection
of
big
Sam
says
they
are
kitschy
and
brilliant.
I
completely
agree.
I
am
also
writing
essays
and
As
it
turns
out,
He
even
had
a
play
put
up
in
New
York
once,
He
and
his
wife
might
I
know
this
is
selfish,
My
favorite
time,
though,
is
lunch
We
spend
the
time
working
...about
music
and
It's
called
Punk
Rocky.
Mary
Elizabeth
is
really
interesting
...but
somehow
she
always
acts
like
Her
best
friend
Alice
loves
vampires
She
also
steals
jeans
from
the
mall.
I
don't
know
why
because
...but
I'm
trying
not
to
be
judgemental.
Especially
since
I
know
that
they
Patrick
never
likes
to
be
serious,
When
he
was
a
junior,
Patrick
started
I
guess
it
was
hard,
too...
...because
Brad
had
to
get
drunk
Then,
Monday
in
school,
"Man,
I
was
so
wasted.
This
went
on
for
7
months.
When
they
finally
did
it,
Then,
he
started
to
cry.
No
matter
what
Patrick
did,
And
saying
that
he
was
going
to
hell.
Patrick
was
eventually
I
asked
Patrick
if
he
felt
sad
...and
he
said
no...
...because
at
least
now,
Brad
I
think
that
I
understand
I
asked
my
sister
about
her...
...and
she
said
that
...the
upper
classmen
used
to
I
guess
she
had
a
reputation.
But
I
don't
care.
I'd
hate
for
her
to
judge
me
So,
I've
been
making
her
a
mix
tape
Ah,
shit!
-
C!
-
Give
a
K!
-
Gimme
a
Y!
-
What's
that
spell!?
-
I
can't
hear
you!
-
One
more
time!

Whatever
happened
to
Fae
Wray?


That
delicate,
satin
draped
frame?


As
it
clung
to
her
thigh
how
I
started
to
cry


'cause
I
wanted
to
be
dressed
just
the
same.


Give
yourself
over
to
absolute
pleasure


Swim
the
warm
waters
of
sins
of
the
flesh


Erotic
nightmares
beyond
any
measure


And
sensual
daydreams
to
treasure
forever


Can't
you
just
see
it?


Woah
oh
oh!


Don't
Dream
It
Be
It

That
picture
is
gorgeous,
Craig.
Oh,
I
know,
thank
you.
Color
film,
but
black
and
Yeah.
My
professor
gave
me
an
"A,"
Most
of
them
are
idiots.
You'll
see
what
I
mean
How
did
your
SAT's
go
by
the
way?
1150.
-
I
think
I'll
get
into
NYU.
1490.
Harvard.
Face!
So,
Are
you
okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But
I
got
my
SAT
results
back.
Oops.
You
can
take
them
again,
you
know.
Yeah,
it's
just
if
I'm
going
...I
have
to
do
much
better.
I
wish
I
would
have
I
was
a
bit
of
a
mess.
I'll
help
you
study
for
the
next
one.
-
Will
you?
Thanks,
Charlie.
What's
this?
Just
a
mix
tape.
My
parents
have
a
pretty
good
stereo,
so...
It's
all
about
that
night
in
the
tunnel.
I
couldn't
find
that
song
...but,
you
know,
I'm
still
It's
okay.
These
are
great.
Nick
Drake.
The
Shack's.
You
have
really
good
taste,
Charlie.
Really?
Yeah.
-
I
used
to
listen
to
the
worst
top
40.
Yeah,
I
did.
Then
I
heard
this
old
song.
Pearly
Dew
Drops
Drop.
And
I
thought
someday
I
would
be
And
I'd
look
up
and
see
And
from
that
moment,
I'd
know
You
know
what
I
mean?
Yeah.
-
I
hope
it
works
out.
Craig
would
be
a
big
No,
shit.
Who
could
forget
Mr.
Car
Wash
Loser?
I
just
hope
she
could
stop
I
keep
telling
her...
You
can't
save
anybody.
Man,
your
mix
is
morbidly
sad,
kid.
How
about
something
So,
Sam
tells
me
Yeah.
Don't
you
write
poetry,
Craig?
Poetry
writes
me.
Let's
get
this
party
started.
That
was
fast.
-
You
want
another
one?
Alright.
Mr.
Anderson.
-
Can
I
ask
you
something?
Why
do
nice
people
choose
Are
we
talking
about
anyone
specific?
We
accept
the
love
we
think
we
deserve.
Can
we
make
them
know
We
can
try.
-
Hey.
I
didn't
see
you
come
in.
You
want
to
work
on
Yeah,
sure.

on
your
book.
Hey,
I
ordered
you
some
breakfast...
Dad,
Can
I
have
30
dollars?
20
dollars?
Sam
is
doing
secret
santa.
It's
her
favorite
thing
in
the
world.
Please.
Have
fun.
Thanks.
Charlie!
This
was
my
favorite
book
growing
up.
This
is
my
copy,
Thanks.
Have
a
great
Christmas
break.
You
too,
Mr.
Anderson.
Terrible
stain.
That's
pretty
good,
Charlie.
You've
gotta
be
kidding
me.
If
you
fail
me,
C
Minus!
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
-
Below
average!
-
Guys.1210.
No
more
applications!
No
more
SAT's!
Thank
you,
Charlie!
Alright.
Alright,
guys.
I
got...
...multiple
pairs
of
blue
jeans.
Wow.
This
is
a
really
tough
one,
but...
...I'm
gonna
have
to
guess...
Alice.
Wait,
guys...
a
receipt!
-
Impossible!
-
Where's
Craig?
But
he'll
be
back
for
New
Year's
Eve.
I'm
sorry
we
won't
be
seeing
him
tonight.
Alright,
big
brother
by
3
weeks.
-
Who's
your
secret
santa?
This
one's
tough.
I
have
received
a
harmonica,
...a
book
about
Harvey
Milk...
...and
a
mix
tape
...twice.
I
mean,
I
have
no
idea.
This
collection
of
presents
is
so
gay...
...that
I
think
I
must
But
despite
that
distinct
possibility...
...I'm
gonna
have
to
go
with...
...drum
roll...
Charlie.
-
Obviously.
Alright,
Charlie.
It's
your
turn.
Okey
dokey.
Uh,
I
have
received...
...socks,
pants,
a
shirt,
and
a
belt.
I
was
ordered
to
wear
them
all
tonight.
So,
I'm
guessing
my
secret
-
Huh.
Now,
why
do
you
say
that?
You
know,
-
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you?
You'll
be
surprised
to
know
that
Why
all
the
clothes?
Well,
all
the
great
writers
So,
your
last
present
is
on
Delve
into
our
facilities.
Emerge
a
star.
Oh,
Perfect!
Will
you
hand
these
out
while
I'm
gone?
Wait
a
second.
There's
rules,
Charlie.
Mary
Elizabeth,
why
are
Hand
them
out,
Sam.
Alright.
-
Alice.
Bob.
And
this
one's
for
me.
"Alice,
I
know
you'll
get
into
NYU."
40
dollars.
"To
print
Punk
Rocky
in
color
next
time."
He
knows
me.
He
really
knows
me.
Alright,
Charlie.
-
Come
on
out.
-
Come
on!
Charlie!
Charlie!
-
Charlie!
Charlie!
Come
out
when...
Yeah!
What
a
display
of
man
-
Where
are
we
going?
Is
this
your
room?
It's
so
cool.
Thanks.
You
got
me
a
present?
After
all
your
help
on
my
Of
course
I
did.
Open
it.
-
I
don't
know
what
to
say.
I'm
really
sorry
we
No,
that's
okay.
I'm
just
sorry
you
have
to
I'm
in
such
a
great
mood,
I
feel
like
I'm
finally
doing
good.
-
You
are.
When
I
met
you,
Now
look
at
you
in
that
suit.
You're
like
a
sexy
English
school
boy.
-
I
saw
Mary
Elizabeth
checking
you
out.
Innocent.
Worst
kind
of
guys.
Never
see
you
coming.
That's
like...
...extra
danger.
Yeah,
well,
it
hasn't
worked
so
far.
You've
never
had
a
girlfriend?
-
Not
even
a
2nd
grade
valentine?
Have
you
ever
kissed
a
girl?
No.
What
about
you?
-
Have
I
ever
kissed
a
girl?
I
was
11.
His
name
was
Robert.
He
used
to
come
over
to
Was
he
your
first
boyfriend?
He
was
my...
He
was
my
dad's
boss.
You
know
Charlie,
I
used
...treated
me
like
shit.
And
get
wasted
all
the
time.
But
now
I
feel
like...
...I
have
a
chance.
Like
I...
I
could
even
get
into
a
real
college.
Well,
it's
true.
You
can
do
it.
You
really
think
so?
My
Aunt...
...had
that
same
thing
done
to
her,
too.
And
she
turned
her
life
around.
She
must
have
been
great.
She
was
my
favorite
person
in
the
world...
...until
now.
Charlie...
I
know
that
you
know
I
like
Craig.
But
I
want
to
forget
Okay.
I
just
wanna
make
sure
that
...loves
you.
Okay?
Okay.
I
love
you,
Charlie.
I
love
you,
too.
Have
a
good
time
at
your
mom's.
Thanks.
And
listen,
Charlie...
...because
your
birthday
...I
figure
you
don't
get
I
thought
you
should
have
my
clock.
Thank
you,
Patrick.
-
Bye.
Have
a
good
one,
guys!
I
love
you
guys!
Hey!
Look
who's
here!
-
Come
here,
little
sister.
Hey,
honey.
Ma,
you
look
so
thin!
Thank
you.
Charlie...
-
Come
I
got
dinner
ready.
-
Happy
birthday.
Make
a
wish,
honey.
Can
you
see
it,
Charlie?
The
luminaria
is
a
landing
Why
don't
you
keep
an
eye
out
for
him...
...and
I'll
be
right
back,
okay?
I'm
going
to
get
your
birthday
present.
Hey.
Hey.
God,
I
missed
mom's
cooking.
You
have
no
idea
how
good
you
have
it.
I'm
actually
beginning
to
hate
pizza.
So
how
are
you
liking
school?
Well,
I'm
no
brainiac
like
you
or
Candace.
But
I'm
doing
okay.
Okay?
How
are
you
feeling,
Charlie?
Good.
You
know
what
I
mean.
Is
it
bad
tonight?
No.
No.
I'm
not
picturing
things
anymore.
And
even
if
I
do,
I
can
just
shut
it
off.
Well,
you
know,
mom
did
say
that
And
maybe
if
it
does
get
bad
again...
-
...you
can
just
talk
to
them,
yeah?
Especially
Sam.
She's
great.
I'm
gonna
ask
her
out
at
New
Years.
Yeah,
I
think
the
time
is
right
now.
How
long
does
this
take
to
work?
Shoveling
snow,
huh?
I
have
to
get
this
driveway
clean.
And
then,
I'm
going
...on
being
happy
-
You
said
that
an
hour
ago.
Oh,
I
just
saw
this
tree,
...and
then
it
was
a
tree
again
Okay,
Charlie.
Don't
freak
out.
Calm
down.
Look
up.
Isn't
it
quiet?
Sam,
do
you
think
that
if
people
knew...
...how
crazy
you
really
were,
All
the
time.
So,
you
wanna
wear
these
glasses?
They'll
protect
you.
10-9-8-7-6...
...5-4-3-2-1...
It's
gonna
be
our
little
secret.
...Happy
New
Year!
Did
your
older
friends
pressure
you?
No
one
pressured
me,
officer.
I
would
never
do
drugs.
Never.
Then,
how
did
you
happen
to
be
passed
out
Well,
I...
you
know,
I
was
really
tired...
...and
I
was
feeling
feverish.
So,
I
went
outside
for
a
walk,
I
started
seeing
things.
You're
seeing
things
again,
Charlie?
Not...
Not
really.
Nice
suit.
It
was
a
Christmas
present.
Did
you
have
fun
on
your
break?
More
fun
than
you're
Nice
look,
jag
off.
I
called
him
30
times.
Well
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
-
They
said
in
health
class...
I
know.
They
say
that
Are
you
sure?
Charlie,
you're
fine,
man.
Guys,
we
have
an
emergency.
Craig
has
flaked
out
on
us
again.
-
Brad?
No,
I'm
not...
Charlie...
...take
off
your
clothes.

Then
if
anything
grows

I'll
oil
you
up
and
drop
you
down

And
that's
just
one
small

You
need
a
friendly
hand


And
I
need
action


Touch
a
touch
a
touch
me


I
wanna
be
dirty


Thrill
me.
Chill
me.
Fulfill
me


Creature
of
the
night


Creature
of
our
night


Creature
of
our
night?


Creature
of
our
night


Creature
of
our
night


Creature
of
our
night


Creature
of
our
night


Creature
of
our
night


Creature
of
our
night

Maybe
I
could
join
the
cast
as
an
Well,
we're
filled
up
now,
but...
...they're
gonna
need
people
I
could
put
in
a
good
word
for
you.
-
That'd
be
great.
Thanks.
Charlie...
Have
you
heard
of
the
Sadie
Hawkins
dance?
The
one
where
the
girl
asks
the
guy.
Obviously,
it
is
completely
I
mean
it's
like,
And
normally,
I'd
just
blow
it
off
But,
you
know,
it's
my
last
year,
and...
-
Would
you
maybe
wanna
go
with
me?
I'm
sick
of
macho
guys.
Plus,
you
looked
So,
what
do
you
say?
-
You
must
be
Mary
Elizabeth.
-
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you.
Charlie
tells
me
you're
a
Buddhist.
-
Please
come
in.
A
little
closer
together.
Buddhist,
I
need
you
to
smile
Are
you
having
a
good
time?
Not
really.
How
about
you?
I
mean,
I
don't
know.
It's
my
first
date,
You're
doing
fine.
I'm
sorry
Craig
couldn't
come.
Yeah.
He
said
he
didn't
want
to
Can't
say
I
blame
him,
really.
I
don't
know.
Thanks,
Charlie.
Have
a
beautiful
first
date.
I'll
try
not
to
make
you
too
jealous.
Now,
just
let
it
breathe.
This
is
sure
a
nice
house.
Thanks.
Don't
you
just
love
old
music?
Yeah.
Good.
Because
I
made
you
a
mix
of
it.
I'd
love
to
expose
you
to
great
things.
Like
Billie
Holiday
and
foreign
films.
This
merlot
is
really
fancy.
Yeah.
My
dad
collects
wine,
It's
kinda
weird,
isn't
it?
I
guess.
Where
are
your
parents?
Their
club
is
hosting
They'll
be
gone
all
night.
That's
sure
a
nice
fire.
Yeah.
When
I'm
done
being
a
lobbyist...
...I
wanna
move
to
a
house
-
Sounds
nice,
doesn't
it?
Your
heart
is
beating
really
fast.
Is
it?
Here,
feel.
-
Charlie?
-
Do
you
like
me?
You
know
what
I
mean.
I
think
so.
Don't
be
nervous.
Charlie...
...I
didn't
know
how
tonight
-
...it
was
really
nice,
wasn't
it?
I
just
can't
believe
it.
You
of
all
people.
I
just
can't
believe
you're
my
boyfriend.
Shit!
-
Here,
zip
this
up!
-
Just
zip
it
up,
like
a
normal
zipper!
Thank
you.
See
you
Monday.
Dear
Friend...
I'm
sorry
I
haven't
...things
are
a
total
disaster.
We're
literally
making
out,
Hello!
And
the
front
door
I
probably
should
have
been
...want
to
go
out
with
Mary
...I
really
didn't
want
You
see,
Mary
Elizabeth
...underneath
the
part
of
Hey!
And
since
I
heard
that
having
...I
tried
hard
to
love
her
Can
you
believe
it's
almost
Yeah,
I
know.
So,
I
took
her
on
double
dates.
Your
first
foreign
film.
-
Do
you
want
butter
in
your
popcorn?
And
I
tried
not
to
mind
that
...even
when
her
hands
are
sweaty.
And
I
had
to
admit
something
I'm
tired
of
touching
her
boobs.
I
thought
maybe
if
she
...the
make-out
music
once
in
awhile,
And
maybe
if
she
didn't
put
down
the
Walden?
I
would
have
called
it
Or
if
she
would
stop
calling
me
...when
I
have
absolutely
nothing
to
talk
Somehow
she
finds
me
things
to
say.
That
dairy
just
sits
with
you.
She's
on
the
phone
right
now?
Charlie,
you've
gotta
break
up
with
her.
I
can
do
that?
For
Christ's
sake...
I'll
give
you
this
book.
I
know
I
should
have
been
honest...
...but
I
was
getting
so
mad,
I
just
wish
I
could
have
found
-
Um...
Mary
Elizabeth.
Can
I
talk
to
you...
You
know
I
hate
that.
In
hindsight,
I
probably
...a
worse
way
to
be
honest
-
Truth
or
dare?
I
dare
you...
to
kiss
Alice.
Courage
your
lions,
procreator.
Mary
Elizabeth?
Samantha
told
me
that
-
Congratulations.
This
one
still
hasn't
gotten
me
flowers.
But
I
forgive
you.
Hey,
don't
worry
about
Penn
State.
-
You're
just
wait-listed.
You
guys
are
about
to
miss
-
Get
a
room!
My
turn.
Um...
let's
see...
Let's
think...
Charlie?
-
Truth.
It's
so
bad...
...that
I
keep
fantasizing
that
...so
that
I
don't
have
to
Charlie?
Truth
or
dare?
-
Dare.
I
dare
you
to
kiss
the
prettiest
girl
And
notice
I
charitably
...because
let's
face
it,
Now
that's
fucked
up.
Mary
Elizabeth...
I'm
so
sorry.
It
was
a
mistake.
I'm
sorry.
Sam!
Sam!
I
really
didn't
mean
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you?
I
should
go
back
and
apologize.
No,
Charlie,
Trust
me.
But,
I'm
really
sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to
do
anything...
I
know
you
didn't...
...but
look.
I
hate
to
be
the
one
to
break
this...
...but
there's
history
with
Other
guys.
Things
that
have
nothing
But
it's
best
if
you
stay
away
for
awhile.
Oh,
Okay.
How
long
do
you
think?
Dear
friend,
I
have
not
seen
I
am
starting
to
get
bad
again.
Charlie.
Come
on,
get
dressed.
We're
going
to
be
late
for
Easter
Mass.
I'll...
I'll
be
there
in
a
minute.
Our
Father
who
art
in
Heaven.
Hallowed
be
Thy
name.
Thy
will
be
done
on
Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread.
And
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
And
lead
us
not
into
temptation.
Mary
Elizabeth...
I've
been
listening
to
the
It's
too
late,
Charlie.
Look,
I
know.
I
just
feel
really
I
just
get
so
messed
up
inside
Tell
it
to
someone
who
cares.
I
know.
I'm
sorry.
I
just...
Good
friends?
Do
you
mean
the
people
that
...and
you've
known
for
6
months?
Yeah.
I
mean
I
just
don't
want
to
It's
ruined.
Okay?
Stop
embarrassing
yourself.
Okay.
I
will.
Goodb...
Something's
wrong
with
me.
Don't
worry
about
it.
Hey,
you
heard
from
Patrick?
No.
He
told
me
to
stay
away.
Oh.
You
don't
know?
Why?
Why?
What
happened?
Brad's
father
caught
them
together.
-
Some
kids
jumped
him
outside
the
O.
Did
you
see
his
face?
-
What
happened?
-
Are
you
okay?
Hey,
nothing.
Sorry,
Nothing.
-
You
gonna
do
anything?
I'm
talking
about
your
Are
you
gonna
say
something?
-
Why
would
I?
This
is
pathetic,
man.
Do
you
want
your
friends
to
know
-
I
got
jumped
in
a
parking
lot.
Do
you
guys
know
about
Schenley
Park?
I
don't
know
what
kind
of
But
you
better
walk
away
now...
...Nothing.
Fine.
Say
hi
to
your
dad
for
me.
Whatever,
faggot.
-
What
did
you
just
call
me?
Say
that
shit
again!
It's
Patrick!
No!
No!
Stop!
Please,
they
don't
stop!
Touch
my
friends
again
-
Charlie?
Thanks
for
stopping
them.
Sure,
Brad.
How
you
doing,
Charlie?
I
don't
know.
I
keep
trying,
but
I
can't
Do
you
want
me
to
tell
you?
Yeah.
You
saved
my
brother.
That's
what
you
did.
-
So,
you're
not
gonna
scare
of
me?
Can
we
be
friends
again?
Of
course.
Come
on.
Let's
go
be
psychos
together.
I'm
dating
Peter
now.
He's
in
college

No.
You

Fine!
Okay.
Your
turn.
Yeah,
I've

Well...
There

The

So,
he
comes

he's
supposed
to
be
out
of
town.
Catches
his
son
with
another
boy.
So,
he
starts
beating
him.
But
not
like
the
slap
kind.
And
the
boyfriend
says,
But
the
son
just
yells
"Get
out."
And...
...eventually...
...the
boyfriend
just
did.
Why
can't

Forget
it.
I'm

He

says
he

But

And

Dear
Friend...
I
wanted
to
tell
you
about
us
running.
There
was
this
beautiful
sunset.
And
just
a
few
hours
...had
their
last
day
And
I
was
happy
...even
though
I
counted,
...1,095
days
to
go.
I
kept
imagining
what
school
...as
they
they
were
all
My
sister
finally
decided
...and
go
stag
with
her
And
then
there
was
Sam.
I've
looked
at
her
I
like
to
see
how
happy
They
were

a
hotel
suite
after

Basically,
Craig

When
I
heard
that,
I
kept
thinking
Because
she
doesn't
She
made
it.
This
is
her
time.
And
no
one
should
be
-
Congratulations.
Guys,
group
photo!
We
should
all
take
a
group
photo.
Oh,
get
against
the
railing
Yeah,
this
is
the
one.
At
her
going
away
party...
...I
wanted
her
to
know
about
that
night
And
how
for
the
first
time,
And
tomorrow,
she's
leaving.
So,
I
wanted
to
give
her
a
part
of
me.
Are
these
all
your
books,
Charlie?
-
Thanks
for
staying
up
with
me.
My
brother
said

State

this
You

That
sounds

fun.
Pretty

You
won't
even
think
Yes,
I
will.
I
had
lunch
with
Craig
today.
Yeah?
He
said
he
was
sorry
and
that...
...I
was
right
to
break
up
with
him.
I'm
driving
away,
Just
asking
myself
...pick
people
who
We
accept
the
love
we
think
we
deserve.
Then,
why
didn't
you
ever
ask
me
out?
I,
uh...
I
just
didn't
think
that
you
wanted
that.
Well,
what
did
you
want?
I
just
want
you
to
be
happy.
Don't
you
get
it,
Charlie?
I
can't
feel
that.
It's
really
sweet
and
everything,
but...
...you
can't
just
sit
there
and
...and
think
that
counts
as
love.
I
don't
wanna
be
somebody's
crush.
I
want
people
to
like
the
real
me.
I
know
who
you
are,
Sam.
I
know
I'm
quiet...
...and
I
know
I
should
speak
more...
...but
if
you
knew
the
things
that...
...that
were
in
my
head
...what
it
really
meant.
How
much
we
are
alike.
And
how
we've
been
And
you're
not
small.
You're
beautiful.
-
What's
wrong,
Charlie?
Promise
you're
gonna
call.
You
know
I'm
gonna
call
you
all
the
time.
-
We'll
all
see
each
other
in
New
York.
Come
on,
Sam.
What's
wrong,
Charlie?
-
Put
your
seat
belt
on.
Don't
wake
your
sister.
It'll
be
our
little
secret,
okay?
Look,
Charlie.
Don't
wake
your
sister.
My
fault.
My
fault.
It'll
be
our
little
secret,
okay?
Stop
it.
Stop.
Stop
crying.
Stop
crying.
It'll
be
our
little
secret.

She

my
birthday
present,
I've
tried
to
stop
She
keeps
driving
away...
-
...and
dying
over
and
over.
-
And
I
can't
stop
her.
I'm
crazy
again.
Mom
and
dad
are
going
to
be
I
was
just
thinking...
What?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie?
I'm
Dr.
Burton.
Where
am
I?
Mayview
hospital.
You
have
to
let
me
go.
-
Don't
worry
about
that.
I
saw
them
when
I
was
little.
And
I
don't
want
to
be
a
Mayview
kid.
Just
tell
me
how
to
stop
it.
Stop
what?
Seeing
it.
All
their
lives.
All
the
time.
Just...
how
do
you
stop
seeing
it?
Seeing
what,
Charlie?
There
is
so
much
pain.
And
I
don't
know
What's
hurting
you?
No!
Not
me.
It
never
stops.
Do
you
understand?
What
about
your
Aunt
Helen?
What
about
her?
You
see
her?
Yes.
She
had
a
terrible
life.
But...
I
mean,
what
am
I...
You
said
some
things
I...
I
don't
care.
If
you
want
to
get
better...
...you
have
to.
She...
She
was
insane.
She...
Charlie,
are
you
gonna
Okay.
Do
you
remember
anything
I
remember
leaving
Sam's
house...
...and
walking
home
and...
I
was
in
the
hospital
for
awhile.
I
won't
go
into
detail
about
all
of
it.
But
I
will
say
there
were
And
some
unexpected
beautiful
days.
The
worst
day
was
the
time...
...my
doctor
told
my
mom
and
Honey?
I'm
so
sorry.
The
best
days
were
those
My
brother
and
sister
...until
Chris
had
to
He's
going
to
be

string
this
year.
And
my
sister
told
me
There
he
is.
So,
I'll
see
you
Thursday
at
6,
right?
My
doctor
said
we
can't
...but
we
can
choose
I
know
it's
not
all
the
answers...
...but
it
was
enough
to
start

We
thank
You
for
this
bounty
in

Amen.
So,
how
do
you
think
the
Penguins
God
damn
Penguins.
I
think
they're
allergic
What
do
the
players
call
a
puck
again?
A
biscuit.
Are
you
sure
it's
not
You're
cruisin'
for
a
bruisin'.
Honey,
I
think
we're
gonna
have
...before
you
take
off,
huh?
I
need
some
books...
Can
Charlie
come
out
and
play?
That
first
night,
we
had
grilled
stickies.
It
was
so
good.
You
have
to
visit
in
the
Fall.
Definitely.
Oh,
sorry.
Charlie
has
Well,
can
I
tell
you
something?
I've
been
away
for
two
months.
It's
another
world.
And
my
roommate
Katie
I
found
the
tunnel
song.
Let's
drive.
I
don't
know
if
I
will
have

I
might
be
too
So,
if
this
does
end
up
...I
just
want
you
to
know
that
I
was
in
a
And
you
helped
me.
Even
if
you
didn't
know
Or
know
someone
who's
gone
through
it.
It
made
me
not
feel
alone.
Because
I
know
there
are
people
who
And
there
are
people
who
forget
what
I
know
these
will
all
And
our
pictures
will
And
we'll
all
become
But
right
now,
This
is
happening.
And
I
am
looking
at
her.
And
she
is
so
beautiful.
I
can
see
it.
This
one
moment
when
you
You
are
alive.
And
you
stand
up
and
see
...and
everything
that
makes
you
wonder.
And
you
are
listening
to
...with
the
people
And
in
this
moment,
I
swear...
...we
are
infinite.
