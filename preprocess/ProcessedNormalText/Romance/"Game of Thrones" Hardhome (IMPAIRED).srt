Your
Grace,
You
will
not
speak.
How
do
I
know
you
are
If
only
I
were
otherwise.
If
you
are
Tyrion
Lannister,
to
pay
your
family
back
You
want
revenge
I
killed
my
mother
on
the
day
I
was
born.
I
killed
my
father
Tywin
Lannister
with
I
am
the
greatest
So
I
should
welcome
you
because
you
murdered
members
Into
your
service?
Your
Grace,
we
have
It's
too
soon
to
know
If
you'd
rather
return
just
say
the
word.
When
I
was
a
young
man,
about
a
baby
born
She
had
no
wealth,
only
a
name
most
of
whom
probably
thought
they
They
kept
her
alive,
often
hours
ahead
of
the
men
She
was
eventually
sold
off
to
and
that
appeared
And
then
the
most
well-informed
told
me
that
this
girl
had
somehow
acquired
all
three
along
with
three
dragons.
He
thought
last
chance
to
build
I
thought
you
were
worth
And
why
are
you
Why
should
I
spend
Because
you
cannot
build
You
have
no
one
at
your
side
who
The
strengths
that
will
either
I
will
have
and
very
large
dragons.
Killing
and
politics
When
I
served
I
did
quite
well
with
the
latter
preferred
torturing
animals
I
could
do
advising
a
ruler
If
that
is
indeed
So
you
want
Very
well.
What
would
you
I
swore
I
would
kill
him
I
know.
Why
should
the
people
Whomever
Ser
Jorah
he
is
no
longer
that
man.
I
can't
remember
as
devoted
to
anything
He
claims
he
would
kill
and
nothing
I
ever
witnessed
And
yet
he
did
Did
he
have
an
opportunity
Yes.
Many
opportunities.
Tyrion:
No,
not
until
He
worships
you.
He
is
in
love
But
he
did
not
trust
you
An
unpleasant
truth
but
one
of
great
He
did
not
trust
that
you
would
So
I
should
kill
him?
A
ruler
who
kills
is
not
a
ruler
And
you're
going
to
need
a
lot
of
it,
if
you're
ever
going
to
rule
But
you
cannot
have
him
Remove
Ser
Jorah

Confess.
My
son.
Let
me
speak
to--
Confess.
I
meant
it.
My
face
will
be



My
name
is
Lanna.
When
I
was
eight,
to
buy
my
first
I
sold
that
bucket
and
made

Arya:
It
took
a
while,
to
buy
myself
Now
every
morning,
I
make
my
way
I
pass
the
fish
mongers
I
usually
see
Lhara,
my
first
customer
of
the
day
Then
I
turn
left

Turn
left
where
I
do
Lanna
is
very
impressive.
Very
industrious.
She
will
make
a
fine
servant
How
will
she
serve
him?
She
will
no
longer
She
will
turn
right
What
will
she
do
there?
She
will
see.

Jaqen:
How
can
a
man
If
he
knew
there
would
be
Oysters,
clams,

Oysters,
clams,
Oysters,
clams,
Your
oysters
fresh?
Best
in
the
city.
You
wouldn't
lie
Mm.
Very
nice.
It's
my
18th
voyage.
Returned
from
all
of
them
Can't
do
it.
Captain:
Please,
Without
me...
Here,
take
it.
I've
three
children.
-
What
will
they
do?
They've
nothing
Please,
you
have
to!
Please,
you
don't
Please!
Jaqen:
He
wages
that
will
make
it
It
is
a
strange
wager
He
only
wins
So
why
would
a
captain
make
the
wager
A
girl
tells
a
man
If
the
captain
dies,
the
thin
man
pays
But
perhaps
the
gambler
and
decides
he
does
not
A
destitute
woman
what
can
they
do
to
such
a
man
To
whom
can
they
turn

The
Many-Faced
God.
You
said
you
didn't
know
A
man
had
no
idea
what
a
girl
would
see
A
girl
named
Lanna
She
will
watch
She
will
come
to
know
as
much
about
And
then
what?
A
gift
for
the
thin
man.
She's
not
ready.
Perhaps
she
is,
And
if
she's
not?
It
is
all
the
same


The
trial
The
High
Sparrow
a
substantial
case
The
charges?
Fornication,
the
murder
All
lies.
Of
course,
My
concern
is
that
to
the
same
standards
I
hope
you'll
excuse
me
but
belief
is
so
often
I
wish
you
had
Is
there
any
word
No,
I'm
afraid
not.
Your
Grace,
has
summoned
back
from
Casterly
Rock
to
serve
He
now
presides
Tell
him
I
need
I
implored
him
to
visit
you,
What
about
my
son,
If
you
can
visit
me,
Your
arrest
the
king
has
not
He
remains
His
servants
often
find
You
need
to
talk
to
him.
You
need
to
talk
to
my
son
and
tell
him
come
and
see
his
mother.
He--
I
tried,
He
wouldn't
see
me.
I
can't
stay
here.
There
is
a
way,
A
way
out.
Confess?
To
the
High
Sparrow?
I
won't.
I
made
him.
I
rose
him
up
I
will
not
kneel
before
and
beg
his
forgiveness.
Good-bye,
my
queen.
The
work
continues.
Why?
Why,
Theon?
I'm
not
Theon.
-
Reek.
Why
did
you
I
was
helping
you.
You
wanted
to
escape.
There
is
no
escape.
Not
ever.
Theon
Greyjoy
The
master
knew.
He
knows
everything.
He
hunted
him
and
strapped
him
and
cut
away
until
there
Good.
If
it
weren't
for
you,
If
I
could
do
right
here,
I
deserved
everything.
I
deserve
to
be
Reek.
!
Turned
on
Robb.
Captured
Winterfell.
-
Killed
those
boys.
They
were
Bran
and
Rickon.
You've
known
them
They
weren't.
Only
what?
-
I
can't.
I
can't,
not
unless
-
Tell
me.
They
weren't
what?
Tell
me
why
Bran
while
you
still
Tell
me
Tell
me
that
they
They
weren't
I
couldn't
find
them.
It
was
two
farm
boys.
I
killed
them
and
burned
them
You
didn't?
Do
you
know
where
they
went,
I
can't
talk
Theon,
you
have
to
tell
me.
Not
Theon!
Reek!

Our
scouts
tell
us
More
than
half
of
those
And
how
high
do
Our
walls
have
been
The
gates
have
been
We
have
enough
food
We
are
more
prepared
All
we
have
to
do
starve,
and
mutiny.
You
disagree?
Stannis
isn't
You
are,
Father.
I
think
you're
missing
an
opportunity
how
House
Bolton
And
what
That
we
not
sit
to
decide
what
sort
of
fight
That
we
hit
first
and
leave
a
feast
A
smart
commander
does
not
As
long
as
we
stay
they
can't
touch
us.
Not
to
mention
we
couldn't
get
even
if
we
wanted
to.
I
don't
need
an
army.
I
need
20
good
men.
So,
have
you
Whether
I'm
worthy
Have
you
decided
yet
It's
probably
I
can
see
why
It's
what
your
father
And
what
would
My
father,
who
publically
I'd
say
his
thoughts
on
having
me
killed
Is
that
why
Someday
if
you
decide
I'll
tell
you
all
about
And
on
that
day,
we'll
need
I
know
What
he
did.
I
know
the
Mad
King
So,
here
we
sit.
Two
terrible
children
I'm
terrible?
I've
heard
stories.
Why
did
you
travel
to
the
far
side
To
see
if
you
were
Which
kind
is
that?
The
kind
that
prevents
Well,
I
did
reopen
Under
my
rule,
murder
will
once
again
Yes,
that
was
wise.
And
you
agreed
to
marry
someone
Very
impressive.
My
own
sister
married
someone
though
not
by
choice
for
the
greater
good,
She
ended
up
Perhaps
it
won't
It's
not
impossible
that
Varys
was
right
Varys?
Yes,
he's
the
one
He
was
my
travelling
before
Ser
Jorah
seized
Jorah
sent
my
secrets
For
20
years
the
Spider
oversaw
He
did
what
he
had
He
did
a
lot
of
other
things
as
well,
I
suspect
he's
the
main
reason
But
you
trust
him?
Yes,
oddly.
He
may
be
the
only
person
Except
my
brother.
The
brother
That's
the
one.
Perhaps
I
will
have
you
Your
queenly
prerogative.
I
had
given
up
on
life
until
Varys
convinced
me
If
you
chop
off
my
final
days
I'm
not
No?
Banish
me?
No.
So
if
I'm
not
going
and
I'm
not
going
You're
going
While
you
can
still
speak
Advise
you
on
what?
How
to
get
The
Iron
Throne.
Perhaps
you
should
try
If
I
want
jokes,
I'm
not
entirely
joking.
There's
more
to
the
world
How
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
Perhaps
this
where
you
can
do
I
fought
so
that
no
child
would
ever
know
I
will
continue
But
this
is
not
my
home.
When
you
get
back
to
your
home,
The
common
people.
Let's
be
generous
Here
in
Slaver's
Bay,
and
only
What
was
that
like?
House
Targaryen
is
gone.
Not
a
single
person
who
shares
The
Starks
Our
two
terrible
fathers
The
remaining
members
will
never
back
you,
Stannis
Baratheon
His
entire
claim
to
the
throne
rests
on
That
leaves
the
Tyrells.
Not
impossible,
Lannister,
Targaryen,
They're
all
just
spokes
This
one's
on
top,
And
on
and
on
it
spins,
crushing
It's
a
beautiful
dream,
You're
not
the
first
person
I'm
not
going
I'm
going
to
break


You
said
whoever
wins
will
fight
I
won.
You
struck
me.
Have
me
flogged
But
I'm
the
best
If
I
win
how
much
can
you
You're
a
free
man.
You
could
have
Why
did
you
come
back?
Let
me
fight
for
her
and
I
belong
to
you.
Woman:
Confess.
I'll
get
out
of
here,
Confess.
I
can
make
you
A
lady
of
the
court.
Confess.
Or
I
can
make
sure
you
die
in
the
most
And
all
I
do
is
sit
here
imagining
hideous
ways




Does
it
hurt?
No.
Good.
How
are
you?
I'm
not
the
one
who
got
punched
You
know
what
I
mean.
I'm
good.
-
Are
you
scared?
Me,
too.

-
Who's
there?
Oh.
Come
in.
I
heard
what
happened.
Oh,
not
to
worry.
Men
brawl
from
time
to
time.
Figured
you
were
hungry.
Oh,
you're
a
good
lad.
Wanted
to
ask
you
if
you've
got
the
time.
I
need
to
check

Sam:
Now
then,
-
It's
about
the
Lord
Commander.
He's
going
up
to
Hardhome
Wildlings
killed
They
killed
everyone
We've
been
This
wasn't
a
fight.
We
were
farmers
So
why
is
he
saving
them?
Wildlings
are
people.
Just
like
us,
there
are
good
ones
The
one
he's
travelling
with,
he
led
the
raid
-
Oh,
Olly.
I've
seen
the
army
I've
seen
And
they're
coming
for
us,
And
when
it's
time,
we'll
need
every
But
what
if
we
let
and
they
cut
our
throats
Jon's
taking
a
risk,
We
don't
stand
Sometimes
a
man
choices
that
might
look
but
you
know
are
right
You
believe
that?
With
all
my
heart.
Try
not
to
worry,
Olly.
I've
been
worrying
He
always
comes
back.


Ranger:
You
trust
me,
Does
that
We're
fools

Lord
of
Bones.
Been
a
long
time.
Last
time
I
saw
you,
The
other
way
around
now.
War.
War?
The
greatest
army
cut
to
pieces
We
should
gather
find
somewhere
You
don't
give
I'm
not
giving
an
order.
Why
aren't
you
He's
not
my
prisoner.
No?
What
is
he?
We're
allies.
You
fucking
traitor.
You
fight
I
don't
fight
We're
not
here
to
fight.
Is
that
right?
You
and
the
pretty
crow
And
when
do
you
get
down
on
your
knees

Gather
the
elders

My
name's
Jon
Snow.
I'm
Lord
Commander
We're
not
friends.
We've
never
been
friends.
We
won't
become
This
isn't
This
is
about
This
is
about
putting
between
you
You
built
that
wall
Since
when
do
the
crows
Jon:
In
normal
times
we
wouldn't.
The
white
walkers
We're
all
the
same
to
them,
But
together
Beat
the
white
walkers?
Good
luck
with
that.
It's
not
a
trick.
It's
a
gift
Dragonglass.
A
man
of
the
Night's
Watch
to
kill
a
walker.
-
You
saw
this?
But
I
trust
the
man.
There
are
old
stories
There
are
old
stories
And
with
the
things
Jon:
Come
with
me
and
I'll
share
Come
with
you
where?
Jon:
There
are
good
lands
The
Night's
Watch
will
let
you
and
allow
your
people

I
knew
Mance
Rayder.
He
never
wanted
a
war
He
wanted
a
new
life
We're
prepared
If?
If
you
swear
you'll
join
us
Where
is
Mance?
-
He
died.
I
put
an
arrow
-

Hey,
hey,
hey,
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Loboda:
I
say
we
send
back
to
Castle
Black
Hey,
none
of
you
I
did.
The
southern
king
wanted
to
burn
him
alive
Jon
Snow
defied
His
arrow
was
mercy.
What
he
did
And
that's
the
courage
with
men
we've
been
killing
I
lost
my
father,
and
two
brothers
I'm
not
asking
you
I'll
never
I
lost
50
brothers
But
I'm
asking
you
to
think
about
They'll
never
have
if
we
don't
band
together.
The
Long
Night
and
the
dead
No
clan
can
stop
them.
The
free
folk
The
Night's
Watch
And
all
the
southern
kings
Only
together,
And
even
then
but
at
least
we'll
give
You
vouch
He's
prettier
but
he
knows
He's
young,
He
didn't
have
He
came
because
and
we
need
him.
My
ancestors
if
I
broke
bread
So
would
mine,

I'll
never
trust
But
I
trust
you,
If
you
say
we're
with
you.
-
This
is
the
way.
Elder:
We
stay
here,
At
least
with
King
Crow,

Tormund.
Keep
that
new
life
And
keep
your
glass,
As
soon
as
you
get
on
and
dump
your
bodies
That's
our
enemy.
That
has
always
I
fucking
hate
Thenns.

-
Man:
Move
it.
-
Man
#2:
Move
'em
along,
now.
That's
it,
come
on.
How
many
are
with
us?
I'm
not
good
We're
leaving
The
free
folk
You
know
how
long
20
fucking
years.
And
he
knew
them
better
They're
running
out
of
food
They'll
come
around.
-
Jon:
Get
yourselves
ready.
Johnna
is
gonna
She's
in
charge.
Man:
Take
her.
I
want
to
go
with
you.
I
need
to
get
I'm
right
behind
you.
Go
on.

Keep
moving.
Won't
be
able
to
take
that
on
the
boat.
-
That's
the
last
one!


I've
got
some
more
daggers
Put
that
dagger
Uh...

Man:
Steady!
-

Shut
the
gates.
Man:

Shut
the
gates!

Open

gate!

line!

Karsi:
Wait,
wait!
Lord
Commander!
Get
them
to
the
ship

But
you'll
never
make--

-
Let
me
on!
-
Bloody
fucking
move!
You
should
be
on
So
should
you.
They're
gonna
let
them
You
have
my
word.
Don't
think
you're
gonna

If
they
get
through,
Night's
Watch,
with
me!
Move!
Move!
Move!


Man:
-
Jon:
Tormund,
the
sleigh!
The
dragonglass.
You
and
me,
then!
Go!

Get
the
glass.







-




Come
on!
The
dragonglass.
Fuck
the
glass!

Oh,
fuck!

-
Man:
Tormund,
run!

-
Wun
Wun,
to
the
sea.

Faster,

Quickly!

Quickly,
row!
Row!

Let's
go!
