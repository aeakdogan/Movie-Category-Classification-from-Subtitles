the
obvious.
A
tax
attorney.
So
he's
gotta
be
smart,
He
drives
a
cabriolet.
A
cabriolet,
that's
good
design.
He
uses
the
word
"robust."
That's
because
a
lot
He
took
me
I
thought
you
said
When
I
told
him
I
didn't
want
he
took
me
to
Long
John
Silver's.
That's
being
attentive
to
your
needs
Who
is
this
guy?
Grace,
this
guy
sounds
He
sounds
awesome.
I
need
you
to
know
something.

Gotta
take
this.

Ned!
Yeah.
Surprised
you
aren't
the
way
your
Padres
Sorry.
Yeah.
Well,
what
was
it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I
thought
so.

Look
at
him.
I'm
about
to
have
a
baby
that
might
and
the
thing
he
is
is
whether
or
not
I
think
that's
sexy.

Yeah.
Yeah.
You
got
lucky,
sister.
Yeah,
I
know.


Yeah.
No,
I
did.
What
is
it?
So
what
are
you
looking
for?
Jacuzzi.
So
how
do
you
feel?
No.
No,
I
feel
the
same.
Maybe
I
should
feel
different.
Maybe
it's
just
late
coming
to
me.
Like
everything
else.

Join
the
club.
Can
you
believe
Mom
was
just
25
Hmm.
Get
in.
I
don't
need
to
get
in.
Come
on.
I'll
wash
your
hair.
If
I
can
get
in.
It's
nice.
I
like
it.

So
when
was
the
last
time
You
know
it's
been
a
long
time.
When
are
you
gonna
You
mean,
when
are
we
gonna
sell
it?
We've
had
good
luck
Selling
it
just
seems
Can
you
imagine
how
excited
Mom
and
Dad
Stop.
You're
doing
it
again.
What?
You're
just
getting
all...
Trying
to
get
me
It's
only
because
I
do.
You
know
I
do.
I
just
want
to
talk
more.
Fine.
What
do
you
You
know
that
baby's
gonna
have
I
mean,
what
if
she's
got
Mom's
What
if
it's
one
of
those
features
and
jumps
onto
the
face
You're
bringing
them
back,
you
know.
I
know.
Are
you
trying
to
make
me
cry
In
a
bathtub
showroom?
You're
gonna
be
a
great
mom.
Like
our
mom.
Hi.
You
know
you
can't
fly
after
Oh!
I'm
only
6
months.
Dana,
come
here
for
a
second.
Do
you
have
a
note
What?
Really?
It's
okay.
You're
supposed
to
if
you
want
to
fly
But
I'm
only
6
months,
so...
Uh-huh.
Carrie?
She
says
she's
only
6
months.

Can
you
turn
to
the
side?
BURT:
I
think
this
is
better,
actually.
This
is
the
railroad.
'Rona,
it's
like
Casey
Jones
Hey,
you
know
what?
I'm
so
tired
of
being
big.
I'm
tired
of
not
having
sex.
BURT:
Do
you
want
to
have
sex?
No.
We
haven't
done
it
in
a
month.
And
you
don't
want
to
now?
VERONA:
No.
I
just...
I
feel
so
ugly.
No,
no,
no.
Don't
be
sad.
You're
not
that
big.
Hot,
even.
Oh!
No.
Honey...
Hey.
I'll
always
love
you.
Even
if
you're
enormous.
Even
if
it
takes
you
months
Even
if
you
gain
weight
Even
if
you
gain
so
much
weight

You
go
ahead
and
write
I
will
love
you.

Even
if
Her
heart
rate's
pretty
slow.
What
is
it?
It's
like
115.
That
seems
normal
Well,
it's
supposed
to
be
She's
just
mellow.
I
don't
want
mellow
now.
I
think
it's
fine.
That's
'cause
you
We
should
fight
more,
Didn't
we
fight
last
night?
No,
we
discussed.
We
need
to
fight.
Okay.
You've
done
something
wrong,
Man,
am
I
cross.

No,
it
has
to
be
convincing.
Like,
should
I
swear?
No,
just
raise
your
voice.

You
cuntsucker!
I
didn't
mean
now.
But
the
element
of
surprise
You've
never
heard
me
say
No.
And
I
will
get
that
heart
rate
up.
VERONA:
Wow,
look
at
this.
BURT:
Yeah,
it
is.
So,
is
Ellen
a
full
And
wait,
which
side
is
she
on?
She's
not
technically
Her
mom
was
an
old
friend
of
my
dad's.
Anyway,
they
started
calling
us
BURT:
She
always
used
to
make
me
Excuse
me.
Do
you
know
where
Ellen
Ellen
Fisher-Herrin.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
Room
340,
about
halfway
down.
Thanks.
She'll
be
the
mom
She
doesn't
have
a
stroller?
I
thought
you
said
she
got
She
did.
Oh!
Here
it
is.
I
thought
her
name
was
Ellen.

No!
Don't
say
anything.
Please.

LN:
It's
open.
LN:
Here
we
go.
Hello.
Welcome.
LN:
Come
on
in.
Come
on
in.
Okay.
Okay.
Mama's
gonna
put

All
right.
I'll
give
it
right
back.
So
great
to
have
you.
How
are
you?
I'm
good.
I'm
good.
You
remember
Verona?
Hi.
Of
course.
How
can
I
forget
Oh!
Verona,
Thanks.
Look
at
your
hair.
Yeah.
And,
well,
it's
a
boy.
A
girl.
No.
Really?
With
those
hips
and
that
shape?
Well,
the
doctor
and
the
sonogram...
Well,
we'll
see.
Right.
LN:
Should
we
go?
Yes.
BURT:
Sorry
we're
late.
Oh!
Right.
Yeah,
I
don't
answer
It's
not
fair
to
the
children.
I
gotta
get
this
one
to
crafting.
We
got
directions
from
this
really
She
was...
Had
brown
hair,
She
had
a
baby.
LN:
Ruby.
Oh!
Poor
Ruby.
She
hates
me.
I
breastfed
her
baby.
Pardon?
Well,
I
was
baby-sitting
and
Wouldn't
take
the
bottle.
So
I
fed
him,
But,
you
know,
I
think
my
mistake
was...
She's
got
lactation
problems,
And
now
she
won't
let
me
baby-sit,
and
I
think
there's
something
So,
dinner.
Should
we
go
out,
Let's
eat
in.

Train
food.
Okay,
let
me
think.
Let
us
get
the
food.
We
can
get
the
groceries.
Look
at
you,
so
helpful.
Oh,
Burtie.
And
I
have
to
say
I'm
so
glad
I
was
concerned
when
I
heard
VERONA:
You
told
her
I
don't
know.
Is
your
tilted
uterus
a
secret?
Yeah,
my
tilted
uterus
Oh,
really,

Your
fucking
uterus
Well,
fuck
you!
VERONA:
You
know,
it
was
really
nice
of
you
BURT:
Yeah.
I
had
no
idea
how
VERONA:
I
told
you.
No,
like,
really
expensive.
I
know.
Well,
let
me
just
hide
this.
You
ready?

You
think
we
got
them
a
good
one?
Hi.


You,
too.
Oh,
fabulous.
Great.
If
you
don't
mind,
there
are
Just
any
of
these?
LN:
Uh-huh.
I
like
those.


Okay.
We
brought
you
something.
Oh,
my
God.
How...
Oh,
my
God.

Okay,
Why
don't
we
just
Okay.
They
had
it
in
blue.
But...

Just
a
little
further
away.
LN:
Okay.
All
right,
come
on.
Okay.
Let's
go
upstairs
Okay.
Hello.

Honey.
Hi.
Hey.
I
don't
think
we've
met.
Oh,
yes,
we
have.
Burning
Man,
'97.
This
is
a
big
bed.
We
are
a
Continuum
home.
VERONA:
What
is
that?
Continuum?
VERONA:
Yes.
Continuum.
Yes.

The
Continuum
the
world
will
give
your
baby
plenty
of
so
while
we
can,
we
should
So,
it's
the
3
"S's,"
no
separation,
They
gave
us
a
stroller.
Oh!

What
is
wrong
with
strollers?
Burts,
I
love
my
babies.
Why
would
I
want
to
push
them
And
you
wonder
why
this
country
Because
of
strollers?
Mama,
in
this
house
We
hold
them
close.
What
about
sleeping?
This
is
where
they
sleep.
So
what
if
the
two
you
know?
Be
alone?
Do
you
go
out
to
the
car?
No,
Verona.
We
don't
go
out
to
the
car.
Are
you
planning
on
hiding
Are
you
guys
making
love?
It
can
be
so
great
in
the
6th
month.
Hmm.
And
it
is
so
important
to
expose
especially
in
utero.
Do
you
know
what
to
have
their
parents'
expression
No.
Oh!
Well,
that's
why
I
have
an
Electra
complex.
Oh,
babe.
It
is
okay.

I
think
that
is
when
a
woman
Do
you
mean
"Oedipal
complex"?
Don't...
Don't
try
Why
the
seahorses,
Rod?
In
the
seahorse
community,
the
males
give
birth.
The
female
inserts
her
ovipositor
That's
where
she
If
I
could,
I
would
lay
my
eggs
I
know
you
would.
Don't...
Don't,
don't,
don't.
So,
have
you
chosen
a
doula?
I
already
had
one.
A
doula,
Burtie,
not
a
dolma.

We
are
not
using
a
doula.
Really?
Oh,
no,
no.
Midwives
and
doulas
are
or
doesn't
want
to
be
involved.
And
I'm
neither
of
those
things.
I'm
really
looking
That's
great,
Burtie.
I
totally
understand,
but
don't
you
think
Verona
who
really
understands
Oh!
There's
this
great
I
can't
remember
the
book,
It's
something
like,
"One
is
not
born,
What
does
that
have
to
do
with...
But
it
is
worth
it.
The
pain
is
so
enlightening.
I
watch
CNN
and
I
really
On
top
of
which,
when
I
had
Wolfie,
It
was
so
beautiful.
This
soup
is
delicious.
Alice
Walker
said,
"There's
nothing
more
And
I
agree
with
her.
And
my
mom
had
a
hospital
birth.
The
stirrups,
the
machines,

And
she
wonders
why
I
can't
Okay,
can
that
maybe
be
the
last
bit
Just
a...
Just
a
thought.
Honey?
Are
you
counting
on
this
job
Where
is
it?
Mutual
Choice.
Because
I'm
already
doing
fine.
This
would
just
be

What
is
it
again,
exactly,
What
do
you
mean?
Yes.
That's
exactly
Don't
worry,
Wolf.
You
won't
ever
Like...
"Anything
like
that"?
Like
fearmongering.
Fearmongering?
Or
skimming.
Cajoling?
Billing?
Roderick...
Are
you
being
serious?
Roderick,
Roderick.
It's
so
easy
to
forget
how
great
These
guys
have
nothing.
How
should
we
expect
them
to
And
Verona
lost
her
parents.
Honey,
how
old
were
you
22.
Why?
Oh,
you
poor
thing.
I
was
just
wondering
how
much
your
about
motherhood
before
she
died.
Your
people
have
such
a
wonderful
Okay,
that's
it!
You
are
a
terrible
person.
And
Verona?
She
is
twice
Because
this
whole
thing...
I
just...
And
this
guy!

LN:
Oh,
honey.
Burt.
We
are
leaving.
What
is
going
on?
You
know
what?
If
I
have
to
explain
it
All
right.
Fly
away.
And
take
that
Gladly!
You
fucking
lunatic!
BURT:
Actually,
Burt,
honey.
Hey,
Wolfie.
Wolfie,
you...
No...
Just
take
a
little
ride.
LN:
Wolfie,
don't
listen
to
him.
BURT:
It
will
be
really
fun,
Do
not
get
out
of
that
chair.
Honey,
you
do
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart!
Listen
to
your
heart...
There
we
go!
LN:
Not
in
this
house!
No!
No!
I
will
not
let


That's
good!
Burt,
Burt...
I
reject
your
LN:
No!
Wolfie!
Wolfie,
did
you
have
fun?
Because
you
won't
have
that
much
fun
This
was
great!
What
a
horse's
ass.
That
was
cool.
Oh,
my
God.

Hi.
So,
how
did
it
go?
Good.
Yeah?
So,
did
they
offer
you
the
job?
Yeah.
Yeah?
I
just
need
some
time
to

So,
they're
probably
They
are
ready
to.
They
just
need
and
formalities.
So,
they
didn't
offer
you
the
job?
No.
I'm
really
sorry
I
brought
I
don't
know
what
I
was
thinking.
Burt.
It
is
not
your
fault.
So,
this
place
isn't
for
us.
I
think
Montreal
is
going
You
know
what
I
hear
You
know
what
they
put
Mayonnaise?
Nope.
Better.

Gravy.
You
know,
I
had
a
dream
about
Really?
What
was
it
about?
Well,
it
was
a
bunch
of
things.
Was
I
topless
in
it?
Yes.

Sorry.
We
did
it.
Sorry.
We're
just
having
a
baby.
It's
okay.
VERONA:
Holy
shit!
BURT:
Is
this
their
house?
VERONA:
We
went
to
college
with
these
guys.
While
we
are
so...
Stunted?

Confused?
Immature?
American?


Do
it
again.


That's
awesome.
Hey,
Camille.
Cammie.
Should
we
come
in?
Okay.
They
are
in
their
room.
Okay.


The
sun
has
gone
to
bed
And
so
must
I
So
long,
farewell
Auf
wiedersehen,
goodbye
Goodbye
There
she
is.
Verona,
you
look
amazing.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Hey.
Good
to
see
you.
It's
great
to
see
you.

Goodbye

All
right.
Yeah.
TOM:
Hey,
great
job.
Hey,
everybody.
Your
mom
and
I
went
Say
hi.
Hi.
TOM:
Get
yourselves
some
pizza.
Pizza.
What's
up,
James?
GIRL:
You're
in
the
middle.
Hey,
so,
the
movie
ends
when

Yeah,
we
sort
of
skipped
it.
You
skipped
the
Nazis?
We
kind
of
figured,
It
is
just
that
we
think
they
could
before,
you
know,
Excuse
me.
Do
you
know
Where
did
you
get
that?
She
has
never
done
this
before.
You
are
seeing
this
Who's
underneath?

Come
here.
Tie
him
up.

Verona!
Verona!
Help!
Isn't
that
cute?
Mama!
Mama!
Hi!
Hi,
Munch.
Oh,
Verona.
Look
at
you!
Thanks.
I
can't
believe
you
are
6
months
in.
You
look
amazing.
You
do,
too.
I
think
he's
been
BURT:
Oh,
hi.
Are
you
okay?
Yeah,
I
have
all
this
gear
at
home.
This
is
the
family
I
want.
All
those
ages.
Everyone
draped
over
So,
you
want
to
adopt?
All
right.
So
we
will
just
trade
this
one
in
No,
I
want
her
and
them,
too.
Yeah,
it
works.
We
should
move
here.
Think
of
that.


Do
you
still
We're
out
a
lot,
I
guess.
I
mean,
it
depends.
because
the
kids
want
you
there,
They
need
air
Should
we
tell
them?
I
think
we're
moving
here.
To
Montreal?
We
already
won
the
competition.
Hell,
yeah!

You
guys!
Let
us
toast.
Okay.
So,
yay
for
Burt
probably,
if
they
are
not
stupid.
Yay!
Oh!
2
more
of
these?
Trombone,
man.
I
was
just
about
to
say
that!
The
'bone!
We
don't
know,
actually.
I
mean,
we
wanted
It
just
sort
of
came
Have
you
had
any
No.
No.
Not
so
far.
It's
been
great.
Yeah.
That's
wonderful.
That's...
Ladies,
I
have
an
announcement.

We
need
real
food.
She
said,
"Mrs.
Farlander,
What
do
you
mean,
You're
still
not
married?
We
talked
about
this.
No.
Why
don't
you
propose?
When
are
you
going
to
propose?
Propose?
All
I
do
is
propose.
Watch
this.
Watch.
Watch
this.
Verona.
You
really
are
Thanks,
honey.
Will
you
marry
me?
Wow.
That
actually
stings.
Is
this
true?
It's
you
who's
behind
this.
I
can't
see
the
point.
That's
romantic.
MUNCH:
Well,
there
isn't
any,
Well,
not
unless
you
have
parents
Which
you
don't.
But
your
wedding
Really
good.
It
was
really
good.
The
wedding
But
what
you
need
to
be
happy,
What
is
that?
Okay,
watch
this.
VERONA:
Really?
No...
Okay,
here
is
you
2
guys.
Stop.
Okay,
so
you
kiss,
you
do
other
things
The
baby
comes
in
there
And
you
guys
hug
and
get
real
tight.
And
this.
There...
And
this...
It's
your
house.
Is
that
a
home?
Is
that
a
family?
No.
No,
of
course
not.
The
people,
the
walls,
the
furniture.
But
that's
not
a
home.
What
binds
it
all
together
is
this.
Awesome.
That's
awesome.
This
is
love.
Yes,
here
we
go.
This
is
your
love,
guys.
Here
it
comes.
The
patience,
your
Man,
you
just
have
no
idea
But
you
have
to
use
all
of
it.
It's
not
like
simple
masonry,
where
you
use
a
little
layer
of
mortar
No.
With
this,
For
every
brick,
there's
I
thought
we
were
doing
syrup.
Mortar,
syrup.
Syrup,
mortar.
It's
all
those
good
The
love,
the
wisdom,
the
generosity.
The
patience.
Patience.
At
3:00
a.m.,
when
everyone's
and
he
can't
find
the
bathroom
and
Patience
when
you
blink...
When
you
blink
and
it's
5:30
and
you
know
you're
going
to
be
tired
And
you
are
thinking,
"What
happened
to
swimming
naked
And
you
have
to
be
willing
to
make
You
have
to
be
so
much
Right?

Wow,
I've
never
It's
like
dance
karaoke?
It's
Montreal.
World
capital
of
this
kind
of
shit.
Montreal,
baby.
Oh!
Now
listen,
are
there
going
to
be
any...
No,
no,
no.
It's
not
that
those
No,
plenty
of
girls
coming.
Okay.
I
hope
so.
Where's
'Rona?
BURT:
I
think
Where's
Munch?
I
have
no
fucking
idea.

BURT:
Uh-oh.
She
had
another
miscarriage.
What?
When?
TOM:
Thursday.
This
Thursday?
Yeah.
This
is
her
5th.
I
know
she
loves
all
those
kids
like
but
I
wonder
if
we
People
like
us,
and
then
we
are
surprised
when
the
And
every
day
another
million
It's
terrible
feeling
this
helpless,
man.
You
just
watch
these
babies
grow,
Then
fade.
And
you
don't
know
if
you're
or
bury
them,
or...
I'm
sorry.


BURT:
Well,
you
have
Or
worse.
Yeah...
You're
my
brother,
This
afternoon.
No,
will
you
stop?
I'll
pay.
I
can
swing
it.
Wait,
hold
on
a
second.
What's
going
on?
I'm
telling
her
right
now.
What?
We're
going
to
Miami.
What
happened?
I
spy
with
my
little
eye
something
that
is
blue.
You...
You
didn't
see
I
mean,
Oh,
yeah.
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
times
It's
a
tick
now.
I've
got
all
the
lines
The
weird
thing
is,
I
never
want
to
hear
But
if
she
came
back
tomorrow
I
would
be
so

Well,
Annabelle
seems
COURTNEY:
I
know.
BURT:
Well,
what
did
you
tell
her?
COURTNEY:
I
told
her
I
made
the
mistake
of
I
actually
thought
that
I
thought
I
would
have

But
then
5
days
go
by
and
So
I
told
her
that
Grandpa
died.
You
told
her
Dad
died?
No,
no,
no,
Helena's
father.
Oh!
Listen,
Burt,
I
really
need
your
help.
I
mean,
if
she's
I
gotta
know
And
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
her
mom
Yes.
I
think
that
Yeah,
but
there's
finality
there.

"Where
is
my
crown?

"Oh,
brother,
I
just
And
to
that
the
crab
replied...

"You
will
never
"because
I
have
hid

And
then
they
fought.
"Give
me
your
tongue.
"That's
my
tongue."
And
then
they
made
up.
"You're
my
best
friend."
BURT:
"I'm
really
sorry
about
that,
Frog.
VERONA:
"Don't
worry
about
it."

"Thank
you
very
much."
"Thank
you.
Be
sure
COURTNEY:
Say
good
night
Good
night,
Bella.
BURT:
Good
night,
Bella.
Good
night,
chicken.
Could
you
stay
a
little
longer?
Sure.
I'll
stay
with
you.
VERONA:

Hey!
Mr.
Tambourine
Man
I'm
not
sleepy
and
there
is
no
place
Hey!
Mr.
Tambourine
Man
Thank
you.
Cheers.
In
the
jingle
jangle
morning
Did
you
see
this?
Oh,
wow!
Man,
she
is
so
cute.
COURTNEY:
Yeah.
She
just
took
that
on
Monday.
Remember
when
we
had
to
wait
Oh,
yeah.
It
was...
Hey.
What's
that
on
her
lip?
Carrot
juice.
Carrot
juice.
Yeah,
so
that's
the
picture.

Yeah,
I
didn't
see
the
carrot
juice
on
I'm
never
going
to
see
stuff
like
that.
Moms
see
the
carrot
juice
Moms
know
when
they
Moms
go
shopping
with
them,
and
make
In
one
fell
swoop,
this
girl's
life
where
she
can
be
to
the
distinct
likelihood
that
she's
A
poor
dresser.
One
of
those
kids
at
the
girls
with
the
new
shoes
Well,
at
least
it's
just
I
mean,
it's
not
whiskey
or
glue.
It's
just
the
beginning,
though.
I'm
going
to
be
spending
every
waking
But
that
little
girl
in
there
will
always
VERONA:

Into
my
own
parade
I
promise
to
go
under
it
Hey!
Mr.
Tambourine
Man
I'm
not
sleepy
and
there's
no
place
Hey!
Mr.
Tambourine
Man
In
the
jingle
jangle
morning
BURT:
Yeah?
Well,
the
fact
that
means
it's
important,
doesn't
it?
I
think
so.
What's
your
name?
Well,
I
think
you
know
more
than
Burt?
So...
Hello?
Burt.
Burt,
what
are
you
doing?
Calling
everyone
she
knew.
Her
old
company.
Her
friends.
VERONA:
At
midnight?
Right.
Well,
can
you
stop,
please?
I
mean,
what
kind
of
goddamned
I
don't
know.
Maybe
not
such
And
you
know
what
There
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
Because
she
is
gone.
And
this
family
And
what
if
one
of
us
We
won't.
It
can
be
fixed.
Thank
you.

Burt.
It's
okay.
Look
at
me,
please.
But
really?
I
mean,
what
if
something
I
mean,
what
if
I'm
walking
by
a
and
then
my
frontal
lobe
gets
chopped
and
then
I'm
not
a
good
dad?
What
happens
then?
Well,
be
careful
walking
near
What
about
Munch?
She'll
be
careful
walking
No,
really.
I
mean,
don't
you
just
look
at
her
everything
that
It
is
so
incredibly
Yeah,
you're
right.
It's
unfair
that
and
that
bad
parents
and
good
parents
die
when
their
I'm
sorry,
'Rona.
Look,
all
we
can
do
is
be
good
We
don't
have
control
Will
you
marry
me?
Never.
I
will
never
leave
you.
I
promise.
No,
I
know.
You...
You
promised
never
to
marry
me
without
your
parents
there.
You
promise
Do
you
promise
to
never
leave
I
promise.
I
do.
Do
you
promise
to
stop
talking
about
your
ability
to
find
I
do.
Do
you
promise
Carve.
...to
carve
in
my
spare
time,
and
teach
our
daughter
the
lore
I
do.
Do
you
promise
never
to
I
do.
Good.

Do
you
promise
to
let
our
or
any
weight
at
all?
Because
we
want
Being
obsessed
with
weight
is
just
Yes,
I
do.
Do
you
promise,
when
she
talks,
you'll
listen?
especially
when
she's
scared?
And
that
her
fights
I
do.
And
do
you
promise
that
if
I
die
some
that
you're
gonna
tell
our
daughter
by
Russian
soldiers
in
this
intense
in
an
attempt
to
save
the
lives
I
do.
Chechnyan
orphans.
I
do.
I
do.
We
had
an
orange
tree.
Who?
When
we
were
kids.
My
dad
was
really
He
planted
it
one
spring,
and
he
used
to
see
if
any
oranges
had
grown.
The
thing
was
sickly
or
something,
One
morning,
my
mom
woke
Grace
like,
at
5:00,
and
she
led
us
out
to
the
tree
with
these
and
pineapples
and
grapes
And
we
just
hung
all
the
fruit
from
It
worked,
actually.
And
then
we
all
ran
into
the
truck
and
we
just
waited
What
did
he
say?
Well,
he
stared
just
staring
at
it.
I
think
at
first
like
the
tree
had
burst
and
then,
I
guess
he
saw
the
and
he
just
started
laughing
harder
And
Grace
and
I
just
ran
And
my
mom
just...
And
from
then
on,
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
us
Usually
something
plastic,
like
pears
or
strawberries
or
bananas.
BURT:
Is
this
starting
VERONA:
I
think
so.
But
I
want
it
to
be
new.
New
for
us.
New
enough
to
feel
like
we
found
it.
Does
that
make
sense?
Yeah.
You
ready?
I
am.
Are
you?
Yes,
I
am.

God,
I
forgot
Subtitles:
Arigon
This
place
is
perfect
for
us.
Don't
you
think?
I
hope
so.
I
really
fucking
hope
so.
