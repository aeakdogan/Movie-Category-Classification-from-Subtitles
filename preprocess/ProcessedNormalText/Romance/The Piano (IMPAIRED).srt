My
father
says
it
is
a
dark
talent,
and
the
day
I
take
it
into
my
head

Today,
he
married
me
Soon,

The
strange
thing
is
That
is
because
of
my
piano.
I
shall
miss
it
on
the
journey.



You're
with
me.
I've
got

you've
got
it.

You

you!
Oh,
I
like
that.
Very
good.
Leave
them
It's
a
bit
rough
out
there.
Could
be
they
can't
get
through
to
you
Do
you
have
things
for
shelter?
She
says,
"Thank
you."


Does
your
mother
prefer
She
says
no.
She
says
she'd
rather
be
than
get
back
in
your
stinking
tub.
You

damn
fortuned
I
don't
smack
Damned
lucky!

MAN:
We're
all
ready
now,
sir.



Mother,
watch
out!
The

Are
they
alright?
Here.

Look,
I'm
a
very
big
moth.
Will
it
catch
fire?
I'm
not
gonna
call
him
Papa.
I'm
not
even
gonna
look
at
him.

Are
we
stopping?
Shall
we
stop?

We

Can
you
hear
me?
Well,
that's
good.
What's
in
this
one?
You're
small.
And
this
one?
It's
very
large.
What's
in
it,
then,
a
bedstead?
Baines,
tell
them
to
carry
in

you
think?
She
looks
tired.
She's

that's
one
thing.

And

No,

No,

Yes,

written
on
sheets

don't
want
to
learn.
You
don't

learn?
What
does
this
do
to

bargain?
I
can't

No,
no
payment.
I'm
not
sure
that
I
want
it
myself.

Oh...
Oh,
I
see.
Well...
I
expect

This
is
all
I
have.
Bring
that
back!


Is
it
alright?
Why
don't
you
play
something?
What
will
I
play?
Play

jig.
Do

Why
won't

Did
you
leave
something?
I've
not
found
anything.
Does

know
something?
The
piano
was
not
harmed?
It
arrived
safely?
Would
you
like
to
sit?
I
am
going
to
sit.
Ada...
Ada.
I
am
unhappy...
...because
I...
want
you...
...because
my
mind
has
seized
on
you
This
is
why
I
suffer.
I...
I'm
sick
with
longing.
I
don't
eat.
I
don't
sleep.

So,
if
you've
come
...then
go.
Go.

Get
out.
Leave!






What?
Whisper
it.
Now
you
are
going
I
am
miserable.
Why
is
that?
Ada,
I
need
to
know,
what
will
you
do?

Wait.
I
don't
know
what
you're
thinking.
Does
this
mean
something
to
you?
I
already
miss
you.

...do
you
love
me?
Come

Mmm.
Mmm.

Mamma!
Mamma!
They're

gone
up
there,

don't
like

Alisdair,
is
it

of
our
play?
Have
the
natives
aggressed
you?
Well,
I
have
to
say,
you
have
done
You
have
put
the
latch
Now
when
you
close
the
door,
it
will
be
the
Maoris
With
the
latch
on
that
side,
Quite
trapped.
We
have
just
come
and
they
have
taken
him
over.
It
is
no
wonder
he
is
leaving.
He
got
in
too
deep
They
sit
on
his
floor
BOTH:
Shred
of
manners.
He's
quite
altered.
As
if
they
have
been
trying
Well,
tomorrow
or
the
day
after,
ALISDAIR:
So
Baines
is
packing
up?
Well,
he's
nothing
to
pack,
Nessie
has
foolishly
grown


Stop
it!
Stop!
STOP!
MORAG:
I
am
quite
frightened
We
must
leave
in
good
light.
Oh,
yes,
if
you
leave
now,

MORAG:
Nessie,
hold
this.
You
know,
She
does
not
play
the
piano

No.
She
is
a
strange
creature.
Like
a
mood
that
passes
into
you.
Up!
Now,
your
playing
is
plain
and
true
To
have
a
sound
creep
inside
you


It's
a
pigeon,
Auntie.
I
should
have
waited.

I
want
to
touch
you.
Why
can't
I
touch
you?
Don't
you
like
me?



Come
on,
Lucky!
I'm
coming
to
fetch
you!


We
must...
get
on.
I've
decided
to...
...trust
you
to
stay
here.
You
won't
see
Baines?
Good.
Perhaps
with
time...


And
be
quiet.
You'll
just
have
to
be
naked
until
I
finish
washing
I
don't
mind
if
you're
cold.
No,
we're
not
supposed
What?!


#
The
grand
old
Duke
of
York
#
He
marched
them
up
#
And
marched
them
down
again
#
And
when
they're
up,
they're
up
#
And
when
they're
down,
#
And
when
they're
only
halfway
up
#
They're
neither
up
nor
down
#
The
grand
old
Duke
of
York...

Crooked,
Mr
Stewart.
Crooked.
Mother
wanted
me
to
give
this
I
thought
maybe
it
was
not
Shall
I
open
it?






Ohhh!
Why?
I
trusted
you!
Oooh!
I
trusted
you!
I
trusted
you!
Do
you
hear?!
Why
do
you
make
me
hurt
you?!
We
could
be
happy.
You
have
made
me
angry!
Speak!
You
lied
to
me!
You
will
answer
for
this.
Speak
or
not,
Do
you
love
him?!
Do
you?!
Is
it
him
you
love?!

Mother!
Mamma!
You
give
this
to
Baines.
Tell
him
if
he
ever
tries
to
see
and
another
and
another.
Mamma!




What
has
happened?
Hush,
hush.

What
is
it?
You're
not
to
see
her!

What
happened?
Tell
me.

Tell
me!


Where
is
she?
Ssh!
Quiet
down!
Quiet
down!
He
chopped
it
off!

What
did
she
tell
him?

Oh.
I
am
going
to
crush
his
skull!
NO!
NO!
NO!
He'll
chop
them
off!
You
pushed
me
too
hard.
You
cannot
do
that.
Just
even...
even
to
think
about
it
I
meant
to
love
you.
I
clipped
your
wing,
that's
all.

#
We
will
be
together
#
You
will
see
it
will
be
better...
#
Are
you
hot?
My
sweet
love
bird.
Are
you
feeling
better?
What?

Oh,
look
at
you.
It's
your
face.
I've
had
that
face
in
my
head,
But
now
I'm
here
seeing
it...
...it's
nothing.
You
have
your
marks.
You
look
at
me
You're
even
afraid
of
me.
Get
up.
Baines...
...has
Ada
ever
spoken
to
you?
You
mean
in
signs?
No.
Words.
Have
you
ever
heard
words?
No.
Not
words.
You
never
thought
you
heard
words?
I
heard
it
here.
I
heard
her
voice.
I
watched
her
lips.
But,
yet,
the
harder
I
listened...
...the
clearer
I
heard
her.
You
punished
her
wrongly.
She
said...
...I'm
afraid
of
my
will.
"Of
what
it
might
do.
She
said...
..."I
have
to
go.
Let
me
go.
"Let
Baines
take
me
away.
I
wish
her
gone.
I
wish
you
gone.
I
want
to
wake
up
and...
...and
find
that
this...
...was
all
a
dream.
That's
what
I
want.

MORAG:
It
was
a
terrible
shock.
Oh,
dear.



No.
She
needs
it.
She
must
have
it.



What
did
she
say?
She
said,
"Throw
It's
quite
safe.
They
are
managing.
She
doesn't
want
it.
I've
been
given
the
key.

Please,
Ada.
Ada!
You
will
regret
it.
It's
your
piano,
She
doesn't
want
it!
Throw
it
over!
Alright,
we'll
throw
it
over.


Ahhh!

ADA:
What
a
death.
What
a
chance.
What
a
surprise.
My
will
has
chosen
life.
Still,
it
has
had
me
spooked,
I
teach
piano
now
in
Nelson.
George
has
fashioned
me
I'm
quite
the
town
freak,

I
am
learning
to
speak.
My
sound
is
still
so
bad
Deh,
deh...
I
practise
only
Kah,
kah,
kah,
kah,
kah.
Vah,
vah,
vah.
Bah,
bah,
bah.
Pah,
pah.
At
night
I
think
of
my
piano
And
sometimes
of
myself
Down
there,
everything
that
it
lulls
me
to
sleep.
It
is
a
weird
lullaby,
It
is
mine.
"There
is
a
silence
"There
is
a
silence
