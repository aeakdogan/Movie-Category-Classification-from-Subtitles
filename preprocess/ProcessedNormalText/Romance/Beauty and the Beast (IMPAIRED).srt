a
young
prince
lived
Although
he
had
the
prince
was
spoiled,
But
then,
one
winter's
night
an
old
beggar
woman
and
offered
him
a
single
rose
in
return
for
shelter
Repulsed
by
the
prince
sneered
at
the
gift
but
she
warned
him
not
to
be
for
beauty
is
found
within
and
when
he
dismissed
her
again
the
old
woman's
ugliness
to
reveal
The
prince
tried
to
apologize,
for
she
had
seen
that
there
was
and
as
punishment,
into
a
hideous
beast
and
placed
a
powerful
spell
and
all
who
lived
there.
Ashamed
of
his
monstrous
form
the
Beast
concealed
himself
with
a
magic
mirror
to
the
outside
world.
The
rose
she
had
offered
which
would
bloom
If
he
could
learn
and
earn
her
love
in
return
then
the
spell
would
be
broken.
If
not,
he
would
be
doomed

As
the
years
passed,
and
lost
all
hope
for
who
could
ever
learn

GASTON:

Hello,
Belle.
Bonjour,

Gaston,
How

this?
There's

Well,
some
people
Belle,
it's
about
time
out
of
those
books
and
paid
attention
like
me.

The
whole
town's
It's
not
right
Soon
she
starts
getting
ideas,
Gaston,
:
What
do
you
say
you
and
me
take
a
walk
over
to
the
tavern
and
take
a
look
Maybe
some
other
time.
What's
wrong
with
her?
She's
crazy.
He's
gorgeous.
Please,
Gaston,
I
can't.
I
have
to
get
home
Good-bye.

he
needs
all
the

Don't
talk
about
my
father
that
way.
Yeah,
don't
talk
My
father
is
not
crazy.
He's
a
genius.


Ooh!

:
How
on
earth
did
that
happen?
Doggone
it!
Are
you
all
right,
Papa?
I'm
about
ready
to
give
You
always
say
that.
I
mean
it
this
time.
I'll
never
get
this
boneheaded
contraption
Yes,
you
will
and
you'll
win
first
prize
Humph!
And
become
You
really
believe
that?
I
always
have.
Well,
what
are
we
waiting
for?
I'll
have
this
thing
fixed
Hand
me
that,
uh...
dog-legged
clincher,
there.
So,
did
you
have
a
I
got
a
new
book.
Papa,
do
you
think
I'm
odd?
My
daughter?
Odd?
Where
would
you
get
Oh,
I
don't
know.
It's
just
that
I'm
not
sure
There's
no

What
about
that
Gaston?
He's
a
handsome
fellow.
He's
handsome,
all
right,
Oh,
Papa,
he's
not
for
me.
Well,
don't
you
worry
'cause
this
invention's
of
a
new
life
for
us.
I
think
that's
done
it.
Now,
let's
give
it
a
try.




It
works!
It
does?
-

You
did
it!
You
really
did
it!
Hitch
up
Philippe,
girl.
I'm
off
to
the
fair!

Good-bye,
Papa.
Good
luck.
Good-bye,
Belle,

We
should
be
there

Maybe
we've
missed
I
guess
I
should
have
taken...
Wait
a
minute.

Let's
go
this
way.



Come
on,
Philippe,
We'll
be
there
in
no
time.


This
can't
be
right.
Where
have
you
taken
us,
We'd
better
turn
around.

Whoa...
Whoa,

place
to
stay
for
the
night.
Oh,
Cogsworth,

Shh!


Of
course,
Monsieur,
Who
said
that?
Over
here.
Where?
Allo.



Incredible.
Well,

you've
done
it,
Splendid,

So,

Woop...
Well!
I
saw
a

I
told
you.
Irresponsible,
waxy-eared,
BELLE:
Did
you
see
that?

It's
a
girl!

I
want
you
Who's
done
this
to
you?
No
time
to
explain.
You
must
go!
Now!
I
won't
leave
you!
What
are
you
doing
here?
Run,
Belle!
Who's
there?
The
master
of
this
castle.

I've
come
for
my
father.
Please
let
him
out.
Can't
you
see
he's
sick?
Then
he
shouldn't
have
But
he
could
die.

He's

must
be

You?!
You
would...
take
his

Belle,
no!
You

I
did,
Yes.
But
you
must
promise
Come
into
the
light.

No,
Belle!
I
won't
let
you
do
this!
You
have
my
word.
Done!

the
girl
is
going

quite
some
time

was
thinking
that

not.

I
thought...
You
want
to
stay
in
the
tower?
No.
Then
follow
me.

Say
something
to
her.
Huh?
Oh.
l,
uh,
hope
you
like
it
here.
The
castle
is
your
home
now,

the

wing.
What's

west...?
It's
forbidden!

you
need
anything

I'll...
I'll...
I'll

she
is
being
so
difficult.
Gently,

Will
you
come
down
to

No.
Hmm?
Ah,

ah!
Suave,

you!

Yes,
I
can.
Fine.
Then
go
ahead
If
she
doesn't

with
me
then
she
doesn't

Here
now.
Oh,
don't

Just

still.

That
hurts!
If
you'd

was
in
here
tonight
raving
about
a
beast
Maurice
is
harmless.
The
point
is,
to
keep
him

Yeah.
Even
marry
him.
So
you
want
me
to
throw
her
father
unless
she
agrees
Oh,
that
is
despicable.

I
love
it!
MAURICE:
then
I'll
go
back
alone.
Yes,
is
that
everything?
I
don't
care
I'll
find
that
castle,
I'll
get
her
out
of
there.


Belle?
Maurice?
Oh,
well.

I
guess
it's
not
going

have
to
come

they
do,

and

but,
I...

Aw,
nuts.


I've
never
felt
this
way
I
want
to
do
something
for
her.
But
what?
Well,
there's
the
usual
things.
Flowers,
chocolates.
Promises
you
don't
intend
Ah,
no,
no.
It
has
to
be
something
Something
that

a
minute!
Belle,
there's
something
But

you
have

a
surprise.

Can
I

No,
no.
Not
yet.
Wait
here.
Now
can
I
open
them?
All
right.
Now.

I
can't

it!
I've
never
seen

it?
It's

it's

you
Oh,

you

would
work.

anything.
Come
along,
Chip.
There's
chores
to
be
done
But
what
are
What's
going
on?




BELLE:
And
almost
kind
But
he
was
mean
And
he
was
coarse
And
now
he's
dear,
I
wonder
why
I
didn't
see
it

BEAST:
I
thought
I
saw
And
when
we
touched
She
didn't
shudder
No,
it
can't
be
I'll
just
ignore
But
then
she's
never
looked
BELLE:
Who'd
have
ever
thought
True
that
he's
no
But
there's
something
That
I
simply
didn't
see...
Well,
who'd
Well,
bless
my
soul
Well,
who'd
Well,
who
indeed?
And
who'd
They'd
come
together
It's
so
peculiar
We'll
wait
and
see

few
days
more
There
may
be
something
there
You
know,
Something
there
What?
There
may
be
something
there
What's
there,
Mama?
Shh!
I'll
tell
you

Right,
then!
You
all
know
why
we're
here.
We
have
exactly
12
hours,
to
create
the
most
magical
spontaneous,
romantic
atmosphere

"Or
beast..."

Right.
Need
I
remind
you
that
if
the
last
petal
falls
the
spell
will
never
be...
broken!
Very
well.
You

know
your
assignments.
Half
of
you
to
the
west
wing.
Half
of
you
to

The
rest
of
you,
come
with

Oh,

up,
Cogsworth
and
let
nature
take
its
course.
It's
obvious
there's
Yes,
but
there's
no
harm

a
little.
Besides,
they
must
fall
in

tonight
if
we
ever
expect
Ah,
human
again.
Human
again.
Yes,

I'll
be
cooking
again
Be
good
looking
again
With
a
mademoiselle
When
I'm
human
again
Only
human
again
Poised
and

I'll
be

And

can't

we're

When
we're
knickknacks
When
we're
human
again,
Oh,
cherie,
I'll
wear
lipstick
and
rouge
And
I
won't
be
so
huge
Why,
I'll
easily
fit
I'll
exude

I'll
wear
gowns,
It's
my
prayer

When
we're
human

Only
human
again
When
the
world
once
more
I'll
unwind,
for
a
change
Really?
That'd
be
strange

don't
Uh,
all
right.
Uh...
Uh...
I
can't.
You
mean,
I
learned...
a
little.
It's
just
been
so
long.
Well,
here,
I'll
help
you.
Let's
start
here.
Here.
Okay,
"Twoe..."
"Two."
"Two...
I
knew
that.
Two
households..."
We'll
be
dancing
again
We'll
be
twirling
again
We'll
be
whirling
around
When
we're
human

Only
human
again
We'll
go

We'll
be
floating
again
We'll
be

again
Stepping,
striding
Like
a

does
I'll
be

that
I
was
On
that
glorious
morn
And
we're
all
Human
again!


Tonight
is
I'm
not
sure
I
can
do
this.
You
don't
have
time
to
be
timid.
You
must
be
bold,
daring.
Bold,
daring.
There
will
be
music...
romantic
candlelight...
provided
by
myself.
And
when
the
moment
you
confess
your
love.
Yes,
I
con...
I-I...
No,
I
can't.
You
care
for
the
girl,
More
than
anything.
Well,
then,
Voila!
Oh,
you
look
so...
so...
Stupid.
Not
quite
the
word
Perhaps
a
little
more

Your
lady
awaits.


Tale

old

Unexpectedly

Small,

a

Ever
a

Tune
as
old
as

Bittersweet
and
strange
Finding
you
can
change
Learning
you
were
wrong
Certain
as

Rising

Off
to

It's
past
your
bedtime.

Good
night,
love.

Belle?
Are
you...
happy
Yes.
What
is
it?
If
only
I
could
see
just
for
a
moment.
I
miss
him
so
much.
There
is
a
way.
This
mirror
will
show
anything
I'd
like
to
see

Papa?
Oh,
no.
He's
sick.
He
may
be
dying
and
he's
all
alone.
Then,
you
must
go
to
him.
What
did
you
say?
I
release
you.
You
are
no
longer
my
prisoner.
You
mean...
I'm
free?
Yes.
Oh,
thank
you.
Hold
on,
Papa.
I'm
on
my
way.
Take
it
with
you
so
you'll
always
have
and
remember
me.
Thank
you
for
how
much
he
needs
me.
Well,
Your
Highness,
everything
is
going
I
knew
you
had
it
in
you.

I
let
her
go.

Yes,
yes.
Splen...
You
what?
How
could
you
do
that?
I
had
to.
Yes,
but...

Why?
Because...
I
love
her.
ALL:
Yes.
I'm
afraid
it's
true.
She's
going
away?
But
he
was
so
close.
After
all
this
time
he's
finally
learned
to
love.
That's
it,
then.
But
it's
not
enough.
She
has
to
love
him
COGSWORTH:

Papa!
Papa!

Ooh.
They're
back.
Belle?
Shh.
It's
all
right,
Papa.
I'm
home.
I
thought
I'd
never
see
you
again.
I
missed
you
so
much.
but
the
Beast?
Did
you...
I
didn't
escape,
Papa.
He
let
me
go.
That
horrible
beast?
But
he's
different
now,
Papa.
He's
changed
somehow.
Hi.
Oh.
A
stowaway.
Why,
hello
there,
little
fella.
Didn't
think
Belle,
why'd
you
go
away?
Don't
you
like
us
anymore?
Oh,
Chip,
of
course
I
do.
It's
just...

May
I
help
you?
I've
come
to
collect
My
father?
Don't
worry,
Mademoiselle.
We'll
take
good
care
of
him.
My
father's
not
crazy.
He
was
raving
like
a
lunatic.
We
all
heard
him,
didn't
we?

No,
I
won't
let
you.
Belle?
Maurice,
tell
us
again,
old
man.
Just
how
big

He
was...
I
mean,
he
was...
I-I'd
say
No,
more
like
ten
feet.

Well,
you
don't
get

It's
true,
I
tell
you.
Get
him
Let
go
of
me.
No!
You
can't
do
this.
Poor
Belle.
It's
a
shame
You
know
he's
Hmm,
I
might
be
able
little
misunderstanding.
lf...
If
what?
If
you
marry
me.
What?
One
little
word,
Belle.
Never.
Have
it
your
way.
Belle.
Let
go
of
me.
My
father's
not
crazy
and
I
can
prove
it.
Show
me
the
Beast.


WOMAN:
Oh,
no,
no,
he'd
Please,
I
know
he
looks
vicious
but
he's
really
He's
my
friend.
If
I
didn't
know
better
I'd
think
you
had
feelings
He's
no
monster,
Gaston.
She's
as
crazy
The
Beast
will
make
off
-
He'll
come
after
them
We're
not
safe
till
his
head
I
say
we
kill
the
Beast!

We're
not
safe
He'll
come
stalking
us
Set
to
sacrifice
To
his
monstrous
appetite
He'll
wreak
havoc
If
we
let
him
wander
free
So
it's
time
to
take
It's
time
to
follow
me

Through
the
mist,
Through
the
darkness
It's
a
nightmare,
Say
a
prayer,
then
we're
there
And
there's
something
It's
a
beast,
he's
got
fangs,
Massive
paws,
killer
claws
Hear
him
roar,
see
him
foam
But
we're
not
coming
home
Till
he's
dead
Good
and
dead
Kill
the
Beast!
No,
I
won't
If
you're
not
with
us,
Bring
the
old
man.
Get
your
hands
off
me.
We
can't
have
them
running
off
Let
us
out!
We'll
rid
the
village
Who's
with
me?

Raise
your
torch,
Screw
your
courage
We're
counting
on
Gaston
Through
the
mist,
Where,
Something's
lurking
It's
a
beast,
We
won't
rest
Sally
forth,
tally
ho
Grab
your
sword,
Praise
the
lord,
We'll
lay
siege
to
the
castle
I
have
to
warn
the
Beast.
This
is
all
my
fault.
Oh,
Papa,
what
are
Now,
now.
We'll
think
of
something.
Ah!

We
don't
like
In
fact,
it
scares
us
And
this
monster
Bring
your
guns,
Save
your
children
We'll
save
our
village
We'll
kill
the
Beast!
COGSWORTH:
I
knew
it
was
foolish
Maybe
it
would
have
been
better

Could
it
be?
Is
it
she?
Sacre
bleu!
Invaders.
COGSWORTH:
POTTS:
Warn
the
master.
If
it's
a
fight
they
want,
Who's
with
me?
Ah!
Take
whatever
booty
but
remember,
Lights
ablaze,
banners
high
We
go
marching
into
battle
Unafraid,
although
Raise
the
flag,
Here
we
come,
And
50
Frenchmen
Let's
kill
the
Beast!
-
Pardon
me,
Master?
But,
sir,
the
castle

Kill
the
Beast!
This
isn't
working.
Oh,
Lumiere,
Wait,
I
know.

What
shall
It
doesn't
matter
now.
Just
let
them
come.
Kill
the
Beast!
Kill
the
Beast!



Now!







Yes!

Here
we
go.

What
the
devil?
Belle,
look
out!
You
guys
got
to
try
this
thing.

Up
here
you
scurvy
scum!
Now!


Oh!















And
stay
out!
Eww!



Get
up.

Get
up!
What's
the
matter,
Beast?

Too
kind
and
gentle

BELLE:

Belle...
No!
Gaston,
don't!


Let's
go,
Philippe.



Come
on
out
and
fight!
Were
you
in
love
with
her,
Did
you
honestly
think
when
she
had
someone
like
me?

It's
over,
Beast.
Belle
is
mine!
Let
me
go.
Let
me
go.
Please,
don't
hurt
me.
I'll
do
anything.
Anything!

Get
out.
Beast!
Belle?
Belle?
You
came
back.





You...
You
came
back.
Of
course
I
came
back.
I
couldn't
let
them...
Oh,
this
is
all
my
fault.
If
only
I'd
gotten
Maybe...
it's
better...
it's
better
this
way.
Don't
talk
like
that.
You'll
be
all
right.

We're
together
now.
Everything's
You'll
see.
And...
at
least...
I
got
to
see
you...
one
last
time.

No.
No.
Please...
Please...
Please,
don't
leave
me.

I
love
you.

Belle.
It's
me.
It
is
you.
Lumiere.
Cogsworth!
Mrs.
Potts!
Look
at
us.
Mama,
Mama.


My
goodness.
It
is
a
miracle.


L'amour.

Well,
Lumiere,

ami.

pardon,

You
