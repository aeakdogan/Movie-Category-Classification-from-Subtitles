CLOPIN:

Morning
in
Paris
To
the
bells
of
Notre
Dame
The
fisherman
fishes
The
baker
man
bakes
To
the
bells
of
Notre
Dame
To
the
big
bells
as
loud
as
the
thunder

To
the
little
bells
soft
as
a
psalm

And
some
say
the
soul
Of
the
bells

The
bells
of
Notre
Dame
Listen.
They're
beautiful,
no?
So
many
colors
of
sound,
Because
you
know
they
don't
-
PUPPET:
They
don't?
Up
there,
high,
high
in
the
dark
bell
tower,
lives
the
mysterious
bell
ringer.
-
Who
is
this
creature?
-
What
is
he?
-
How
did
he
come
to
be
there?
-
Hush.
Clopin
will
tell
you.
It
is
a
tale,
a
tale
of
a
man...
And
a
monster.

Dark
was
the
night

On
the
docks
near
Notre
Dame
-
Shut
it
up,
will
you?
Hush,
little
one.
Four
frightened
gypsies
The
docks
near
Notre
Dame
Four
guilders
A
trap
had
been
laid
for
the
gypsies
And
they
gazed
up
in
fear
and
alarm
At
a
figure
whose
clutches
Were
iron
as
much
as
the
bells
Judge
Claude
Frollo!
The
bells
of
Notre
Dame
CHOIR:
Kyrie
eleison
CLOPIN:
Judge
Claude
Frollo
longed
CHOIR:
Kyrie
eleison
CLOPIN:
And
he
saw
corruption
Everywhere
except
within
Bring
these
gypsy
vermin
You
there!
What
are
you
hiding?
Stolen
goods,
no
doubt.

CHOIR:
Dies
irae
Dies
illa
Solvet
saeclum
in
favilla


Quantus
tremor
est
futurus

Quando
judex
est
venturus
Sanctuary!
Please,
give
us
sanctuary!
Quantus
tremor
est
futurus


Dies
irae

A
baby?

A
monster!
Solvet
saeclum
in
favilla
Dies
irae


"Stop!"
cried
the
archdeacon.
This
is
an
unholy
demon.
I'm
sending
it
back
to
hell,

See,
there,
On
the
steps
of
Notre
Dame
I
am
guiltless.
She
ran.
I
pursued.
Now
you
would
add
this
child's
On
the
steps
of
Notre
Dame
My
conscience
is
clear.
You
can
lie
to
yourself
You
can
claim
that
you
haven't
a
qualm
But
you
never
can
run
from
Nor
hide
what
you've
done
The
very
eyes
Of
Notre
Dame
CHOIR:
Kyrie
eleison
CLOPIN:
And
for
one
time
in
his
life
Of
power
and
control
CHOIR:
Kyrie
eleison
CLOPIN:
Frollo
felt
a
twinge
of
fear
What
must
I
do?
Care
for
the
child
What?
I
am
to
be
saddled
Very
well.
But
let
him
live
with
you
in
your
church.
Live
here?
Where?
Anywhere.

Where
no
one
else
can
see
The
bell
tower,
perhaps.
And
who
knows?
Our
Lord
works

Even
this
foul
creature
Of
use
to
me
And
Frollo
gave
the
child
a
cruel
name,
a
name
that
means
"half-formed."
Quasimodo.

Now
here
is
a
riddle
Sing
the
bells
of
Notre
Dame
Who
is
the
monster
and
who
is
the
man

Sing
the
bells,
bells
Bells,
bells
Bells
of
Notre
Dame

Good
morning.
Will
today
be
the
day?

Why,
if
I
picked
a
day
to
fly,
The
Festival
of
Fools.


It
will
be
fun
with
jugglers



Go
on.
Nobody
wants


Oh,
man!
I
thought
he'd
never
leave.
Well,
that's
what
you
get

Hey,
Quasi,
what's
goin'
on
out
there?
-
A
fight?
A
flogging?
-
You
mean
a
Feast
of
Fools?
All
right,
all
right!
It
is
a
treat
to
watch
the
colorful
Boy,
nothin'
like
balcony
seats
Yeah,
watchin'.
Oh,
look.
A
mime.


Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
What
gives?
Aren't
you
-
I
don't
get
it.
LAVERNE:
Impossible.
If
20
years
of
listenin'
to
you
two
hasn't
Watching
the
Festival
of
Fools
has
always
been
the
highlight
What
good
is
watchin'
the
party
Here,
get
away
from
me!
He's
not
made
of
stone,
like
us.
Quasi,
what's
wrong?
I
just
don't
feel
Well,
did
ya
ever
think
Sure.
But
I'd
never
fit
in
out
there.
I'm
not
normal.
Oh,
Quasi,
Quasi,
Quasi.
Do
ya
mind?
I
would
like
to
have
a
moment
Hey,
quit
beatin'
around
the
bell
tower.
What
do
we
gotta
do,
paint
ya
a
fresco?
As
your
friends
and
guardians,
-
Me?
It
would
be
a
veritable
potpourri
Wine,
women
and
song.
You
can
learn
to
identify
-
Bobbin'
for
snails.
Playin'
dunk
the
monk!
Quasi,
take
it
from
an
old
spectator.
If
watchin'
is
all
you're
gonna
do,
then
you're
gonna
watch
Yeah,
you're
human,
with
the
flesh
We're
just
part
of
the
architecture.
Yet,
if
you
kick
us,
will
we
not
flake?
If
you
moisten
us,
do
we
not
grow
moss?

Quasi,
just
grab
a
fresh
tunic
Thanks
for
the
encouragement.
GARGOYLES:
What?
My
master,
Frollo.
GARGOYLES:
Oh.
Well,
when
he
says
you're
forbidden
does
he
mean
"ever,
"
ever?
Never
ever.
-
He'd
be
furious
if
I
asked
to
go.
-
Oh,
no.
-
It's
just
one
afternoon.
And
ya
sneak
back
in.
-
He'll
never
know
you
were
gone.
Better
to
beg
forgiveness
He
might
see
me.
You
could
wear
a
disguise.
What
Frollo
doesn't
know
can't
hurt
ya.
-
Ignorance
is
bliss.
Nobody
wants
to
stay
You're
right.
I'll
go.
-
I'll
get
cleaned
up.
-
I'll
stroll
down
those
stairs.
I'll
march
through
the
doors
and...
Good
morning,
Quasimodo.

Dear
boy,
whomever
are
you
talking
to?
My
friends.
I
see.
And
what
are
your
Stone.
-
Can
stone
talk?
That's
right.
You're
a
smart
lad.
Now,
lunch.
Shall
we
review
your
alphabet
today?
Oh,
yes,
Master.
-
Very
well.
"A"?
-
"B"?
-
"C"?
-
"D"?
-
"E"?
-
Good.
"F"?

Excuse
me?
-
You
said,
"Festival."
You
are
thinking
It's
just
that
you
go
every
year.
I
am
a
public
official.
I
must
go.
But
I
don't
enjoy
a
moment.
Thieves
and
cutpurses,
all
mixed
together
I
didn't
mean
to
upset
you,
Master.
Quasimodo,
can't
you
understand?
When
your
heartless
mother
anyone
else
would
have
drowned
you.
And
this
is
my
thanks
for
taking
you
in
I'm
sorry,
sir.
Oh,
my
dear
Quasimodo.
You
don't
know
what
it's
like
out
there.
I
do.
I
do.

The
world
is
cruel
The
world
is
wicked
It's
I
alone
whom
you
can
I
am
your
only
friend
I,
who
keep
you,
teach
you
I,
who
look
upon
you
without
fear
How
can
I
protect
you,
boy
Unless
you
always
stay
in
here
Away
in
here
Remember
what
-
You
are
deformed
-
And
you
are
ugly
And
these
are
crimes
You
do
not
comprehend
You
are
my
one
defender
Out
there
they'll
I
am
a
monster
Out
there
they
Only
a
monster
Why
invite
their
calumny
Stay
in
here
-
Be
faithful
to
me
-
FROLLO:
Grateful
to
me
Do
as
I
say
Obey
-
And
stay
in
here
You
are
good
to
me,
Master.
-
I'm
sorry.
But,
remember,
Quasimodo,
My
sanctuary.
Safe
behind
these
windows
Gazing
at
the
people
down
below
me

All
my
life,
I
watch
them
Hungry
for
the
histories
they
show
me
All
my
life
I
memorize
their
faces
Knowing
them
All
my
life,
I
wonder
Not
above
them
But
part
of
them
And
out
there
Living
in
the
sun
Give
me
one
day
out
there
All
I
ask
is
one
To
hold
forever
Out
there
Where
they
all
live
unaware
What
I'd
give
What
I'd
dare
Just
to
live
One
day
Out
there
Out
there
among
the
millers

Through
the
roofs
and
gables
Every
day
they
shout
and
scold
Heedless
of
the
gift
it
is
to
be
them
If
I
was
in
their
skin
I'd
treasure
Every
instant
Out
there
Strolling
by
the
Seine
Taste
the
morning
out
there
Like
ordinary
men
Who
freely
walk
about
there
Just
one
day
and
then
I
swear
I'll
be
content
With
my
share
Won't
resent
Old
and
bent
I'll
have
spent
Out
there


Hmm.
Uh-uh.
You
leave
town
for
a
couple
of
decades,
Excuse
me,
gentlemen,
I'm
looking
for
Mmm.
I
guess
not.


Ah!

Stay
away,
child.
They're
gypsies.



All
right,
gypsy.
-
Where'd
ya
get
the
money?
-
Gypsies
don't
earn
money.
You'd
know
a
lot
about
stealing.
Troublemaker,
eh?
Maybe
a
day
in
the
stocks
Oof!
Come
back
here,
gypsy!

Achilles,
sit.
Hey!
Whoa!
Oh,
dear,
I'm
sorry.
Naughty
horse!
Naughty!
He's
just
impossible.
Get
this
thing
off
me!
I'll
teach
you
a
lesson,
peasant!
You
were
saying,
Lieutenant?

Oh,
Captain!

At
your
service,
sir!
I
know
you
have
a
lot
but
the
palace
of
justice?

Make
way
for
the
captain!
SOLDIER

SOLDIER

Come

Achilles,

FROLLO:
Stop.
Ease
up.
Wait
between
lashes.
Otherwise
the
old
sting
Yes,
sir.
Ah,
so
this
is
the
gallant
Reporting
for
duty,
as
ordered,
sir.
Your
service
record
I
expect
nothing
but
the
best
And
you
shall
have
it,
sir.
I
guarantee
it.
Yes.
You
know,
my
last
captain
of
the
guard

Well,
no
matter.

Uh,
thank
you.
FROLLO:
You've
come
to
Paris
It
will
take
a
firm
hand
-
from
being
so
easily
misled.
Look,
Captain.
Gypsies.
The
gypsies
live
outside
Their
heathen
ways
inflame
And
they
must
be
stopped.
I
was
summoned
from
the
wars
to
capture
fortune
tellers
Oh,
the
real
war,
Captain,
For
20
years,
I
have
been
one
by
one.
And
yet,
for
all
my
success,
I
believe
they
have
a
safe
haven
A
nest,
if
you
will.
They
call
it
the
court
of
miracles.
What
are
we
going
to
do
about
it,
sir?
You
make
your
point
quite
vividly,
sir.
You
know,
I
like
you,
Captain.
Shall
we?

Oh,
duty
calls.
Have
you
ever
attended
Not
recently,
sir.
Then
this
should
be

Master!
Master,
please,
help
me!

Sir,
request
permission
In
a
moment,
Captain.

Don't
be
afraid.
I'm
sorry.
This
wasn't
supposed
to
happen.
You!
Gypsy
girl!
Get
down
at
once!
Yes,
your
honor.
I
forbid
it!
How
dare
you
defy
me?
You
mistreat
this
poor
boy
You
speak
of
justice,
yet
you
are
cruel
-
Silence!

Mark
my
words,
gypsy.
Then
it
appears
The
only
fool
I
see
is
you!

Captain
Phoebus,
arrest
her.


Now,
let's
see.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
So
there's
ten
of
you
and
one
of
me.


Witchcraft!
ESMERALDA:
Oh,
boys.
Over
here.

SOLDIER
1:
There
she
is!








I'm
free!
I'm
free!
Ooh!
Dang
it.
SOLDIER:
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!


What
a
woman.


Whoa!




Find
her,
Captain.
I
want
her
alive.
Yes,
sir.
Seal
off
the
area,
men.
Find
the
gypsy
girl
and
do
not
harm
her.
I'm
sorry,
Master.

WOMAN:
Oh,
he's
hideous.
SOLDIER:
You,
there,
get
away!
Hmm.

You!
Easy,
easy.
I
just
shaved
this
morning.
-
Oh,
really?
You
missed
a
spot.
Just
calm
down.
For
what?

You
sneaky
son
of
a...
Ah,
ah,
ah.
Watch
it.
You're
in
a
church.
Are
you
always
this
charming,
Whoa!

Candlelight,
privacy,
music.
Can't
think
of
a
better
place
Ooh!
You
fight
almost
as
well
as
a
man.
Funny,
I
was
going
to
say
That's
hitting
a
little
below
the
belt,
No.
This
is.
Ooh!

Touch.

-
I
didn't
know
you
had
a
kid.
Uh,
I
noticed.
Uh...
Permit
me.
I'm
Phoebus.
It
means
"sun
god."
-
And
you
are?
I
believe
it's
called
an
introduction.
-
You're
not
arresting
me?
Huh.
You're
not
at
all
Thank
you.
So,
if
you're
not
going
to
arrest
me,
I'd
settle
for
your
name.
-
Esmeralda.
Much
better
than
Phoebus,
anyway.
Good
work,
Captain.
Now
arrest
her.


Claim
"sanctuary."
-
Say
it!
I'm
waiting,
Captain.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
She
claimed
sanctuary.
There's
nothing
I
can
do.
Then
drag
her
outside
and...
Frollo,
you
will
not
touch
her!
Minister
Frollo
learned
years
ago
All
right,
all
right.
I'm
going.

You
think
you've
outwitted
me.
But
I'm
a
patient
man.
And
gypsies
don't
do
well

What
are
you
doing?
I
was
just
imagining
a
rope
I
know
what
you
were
imagining.
Such
a
clever
witch.
So
typical
of
your
kind
to
twist
the
truth.
To
cloud
the
mind
with
unholy
thoughts.
Well,
no
matter.
You've
chosen
a
magnificent
prison.
But
it
is
a
prison,
nonetheless.
Set
one
foot
outside,
and
you're
mine.
Frollo's
orders.

Don't
worry,
Djali.
If
Frollo
thinks
he
can
keep
us
here,
Don't
act
rashly,
my
child.
You
created
quite
a
stir
at
the
festival.
It
would
be
unwise
to
arouse
You
saw
what
he
did
out
there,
I
thought
if
just
one
person

What
do
they
have
against
people
You
can't
right
No
one
out
there
is
going
to
help,
Well,
perhaps
there's


I
don't
know
Or
if
You're
even
there
I
don't
know
if
You
would
listen
To
a
gypsy's
prayer
Yes,
I
know
I'm
just
an
outcast
I
shouldn't
speak
to
You
Still,
I
see
your
face
and
wonder
Were
You
once
an
outcast,
too?
God
help
the
outcasts
Hungry
from
birth
Show
them
the
mercy
They
don't
find
on
earth
God
help
my
people
We
look
to
You
still
God
help
the
outcasts
Or
nobody
will
PARISHIONERS:
I
ask
for
wealth
I
ask
for
fame
I
ask
for
glory
To
shine
on
my
name
I
ask
for
love
I
can
possess
I
ask
for
God
and
His
angels
To
bless
me
I
ask
for
nothing
I
can
get
by
But
I
know
so
many
Less
lucky
than
I
Please
help
my
people
The
poor
and
downtrod
I
thought
we
all
were
The
children
of
God
God
help
the
outcasts
Children
of
God
You!
Bell
ringer!
What
are
you
doing
down
here?
Oh!
Haven't
you
caused
Wait.
I
want
to
talk
to
you.
Look,
he's
got
a
friend
with
him.
Yeah.
Maybe
today
wasn't
-
A
vision
of
loveliness.
-
Way
to
go,
Quasi!
-
We
knew
you
had
it
in
ya.
Actually,
I...
You
mustn't
run
too
fast,
Yes,
I
know.
That's
what
I...
Give
her
some
slack,
then
reel
her
in.
Then
give
her
some
slack,
-
Then
give
her
some
slack...
She's
a
girl,
not
a
mackerel.
Here
you
are.
I
was
afraid
I'd
lost
you.
Yes.

Well,
I,
uh...
I
have
chores
to
do.

-
Oh.

I'm
really
sorry
about
this
afternoon.
I
would
never
in
my
life
Up
on
the...
Stage.
-
What
is
this
place?
Did
you
make
all
these
things
yourself?
QUASIMODO:
Most
of
them.
This
is
beautiful.
If
I
could
do
this,
you
wouldn't
find
me
But
you're
a
wonderful
dancer.
Well,
it
keeps
bread
on
the
table,

Oh,
no,
please!
I
still
have
to
paint
them.

You're
a
surprising
person,
Quasimodo.
Not
to
mention
lucky.
Well,
it's
not
just
me.
There's
the
gargoyles
-
Would
you
like
to
see
them?
Follow
me.
I'll
introduce
you.
-
I
never
knew
there
were
so
many.
And
Jeane-Marie,
Triplets,
you
know.
-
And
who's
this?

Hello!
She
likes
you.
How
about
it,
Djali?

-
We'd
love
to.
I've
saved
the
best
for
last.
ESMERALDA:
Oh!
ESMERALDA:
I
bet
the
king
-
I
could
stay
up
here
forever.
No,
I
couldn't.
-
Oh,
yes,
you
have
sanctuary.
"Gypsies
don't
do
well
But
you're
not
like
other
gypsies.
-
Who
told
you
that?
He
raised
me.
How
can
such
a
cruel
man
have
Cruel?
Oh,
no.
He
saved
my
life.
-
I
am
a
monster,
you
know.
Look
at
me.
-
Give
me
your
hand.
Just
let
me
see
it.
Hmm.
A
long
lifeline.
Oh,
and
this
one
means
you're
shy.
Hmm.
Hmm,
hmm,
hmm.
-
Well,
that's
funny.
-
I
don't
see
any...
Monster
lines.
Not
a
single
one.
Now
you
look
at
me.
No!
No,
no.
And
a
gypsy.
And
maybe
Frollo's
wrong
What
did
she
say?
Frollo's
nose
is
long,
Ha!
Told
ya!
Pay
up.
-
Oh,
dear.
You
helped
me.
Now
I
will
help
you.
But
there's
no
way
out.
We
won't
use
a
door.
-
You
mean,
climb
down?
-
You
carry
him.
I
carry
you.
Come
on,
Djali.
-
Ready?
-
Don't
be
afraid.
-
Now
I'm
afraid.

ESMERALDA:
You've
done
this
before?
QUASIMODO:
No.

Ooh!
Wow,
you're
quite
an
acrobat.
Thank
you.
Whoa!

SOLDIER
1:
Check
the
alley!

-
I
hope
I
didn't
scare
you.

-
Come
with
me.
To
the
court
of
miracles.
Oh,
no.
I'm
never
going
back
out
there
again.
No.
This
is
where
I
belong.
All
right,
then
I'll
come
to
see
you.
-
Here?
But
the
soldiers
and
Frollo!
But
at
sunset,
I
ring
the
evening
mass,
And
then
I
ring
the
vespers,
and...
If
you
ever
need
sanctuary,
-
But
how?
When
you
wear
this
woven
band,


Hurry.
You
must
go.
SOLDIER
1:
Check
the
alley.
SOLDIER
2:
Yes,
sir.
No
one
here,
sir.
SOLDIER
3:
No
one
here,
sir.
SOLDIER
1:
Check
the
street.

I'm
looking
for
the
gypsy
girl.

-
Whoa,
whoa!
Easy!
-
Wait!
All
I
want
is
to...
I
mean
her
no
harm.

Go!
You
tell
her
for
me,
But
it
was
the
only
way
Will
you
tell
her
that?
Will
you?
If
you
go.
Now.
I'll
go.
Now,
will
you
put
me
down,
please?
Oh,
and
one
more
thing.
-
Tell
Esmeralda
she's
very
lucky.
To
have
a
friend
like
you.
HUGO:
Hey,
hey,
there
he
is.

You
ejected
that
tin-plated
buffoon
The
nerve
of
him,
snoopin'
around
here,
-
My
girl?
Dark
hair,
works
with
a
goat,
remember?
Boy,
I
do.
Way
to
go,
lover
boy.
"Lover
boy"?
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Oh,
don't
be
so
modest.
Look,
I
appreciate
But
let's
not
fool
ourselves.
I
don't
think
I'm
her
type.

So
many
times
out
there
Of
lovers
walking
in
the
night
They
had
a
kind
of
glow
around
them
It
almost
looked
like
heaven's
light

I
knew
I'd
never
know
That
warm
and
loving
glow
Though
I
might
wish
with
all
my
might
No
face
as
hideous
as
my
face
Was
ever
meant
for
heaven's
light
But
suddenly
an
angel
has
smiled
at
me
And
kissed
my
cheek
I
dare
to
dream
that
she
Might
even
care
for
me
And
as
I
ring
these
bells
tonight

Eh?
My
cold
dark
tower
seems
so
bright
I
swear
it
must
be
heaven's
light

Frollo,
the
gypsy
has
escaped.
-
What?
-
She's
gone.
Get
out,
you

I'll
find

I'll

Good
morning,
sir.
Oh.

Are
you
feeling
all
right?

I
had
a
little
trouble
-
I
see.
Your
orders,
sir?

Ten
pieces
of
silver
Lock
them
up.

Twenty
pieces
of
silver
Take
them
away!


WOMAN:
Poor
miller.
MAN:
Frollo's
gone
mad.
FROLLO:
We
found
this
gypsy
talisman
Have
you
been
harboring
gypsies?
Our
home
is
always
open
Have
mercy,
my
lord.
I
am
placing
you
and
your
family
until
I
get
to
the
bottom
of
this.
If
what
you
say
is
true
then
you
have
nothing
to
fear.
But
we
are
innocent.
I
assure
you,
-
Burn
it.
Until
it
smolders.
These
people
are
traitors
With
all
due
respect,
sir,
I
was

you
were
trained
to
follow

Insolent
coward.






The
sentence
Such
a

Consider
it
my
highest
honor,
sir.


FROLLO:
Get
him!


Don't
waste
your

Find
the

Sir,
we've
looked
everywhere
I
had
the

Guards
at

There

Unless...

Oh,
it
doesn't
look
good.
-
It's
hopeless.
Absolutely
hopeless.
I'm
losing'
to
a
bird!
Oh,
but
that
poor
gypsy
girl.
I
know.
But
now
don't
you
say
He's
worried
enough
already.
Yeah,
you're
right.
We
better
lighten
up.

-
Here
he
comes.
-
Not
a
word.
-
Stone-faced.
Mmm.
Mmm.

Oh,
it's
a
lost
cause!
In
the
stocks,
Oh!

-
Nice
work,
Victor.
What
are
you
guys
talkin'
about?
If
I
know
Esmeralda,
she's
three
steps
ahead
of
Frollo
Do
you
really
think
so?
Hey,
when
things
cool
off,
-
What
makes
you
so
sure?
We
always
said
you
were
the
cute
one.
I
thought
I
was
the
cute
one.
No,
you're
the
fat,
stupid
one
What
are
you
saying',
exactly?
Take
it
from
us,
Quasi.
Yeah.
You're
irresistible.

Knights
in
shining
And
those
guys
are
a
dime
a
dozen.
But
you,
you're
one
of
a
kind.
Look.

Paris,
the
city
of
lovers

True,
that's
because
it's
on
fire
But
still
there's
glamour
Somewhere
out
there
in
the
night
Her
heart
is
also
alight
And
I
know
the
guy
A
guy
like
you
She's
never
known,
kid
A
guy
like
you
A
girl
does
not
meet
every
day
You've
got
a
look
That's
all
your
own,
kid
ALL:
Like
you?

Because
it's

You're

You
see
that
face
Want
something
new
That's
you.
For
sure
We
all
have
gaped
at
some
Adonis
But
then
we
crave
a
meal

And
since
you're

question
of

me

like
you
with

you

A

could
tell
it's

she

ESMERALDA:
Quasi?
Quasimodo?
Esmeralda?
Esmeralda,
you're
all
right!
You've
done
so
much
But
I
must
ask
your
help
one
more
time.
Yes,
anything.
This
is
Phoebus.
He
can't
go
on
much
longer.
Please,
can
you
hide
him?
This
way.

-
Esmeralda.
You'll
hide
here
Great.
I
could
use
a
drink.
Ahhh!
Yes.
Mmm.
Feels
like
a
1470
burgundy.
That
family
owes
you
their
lives.
You're
either
the
single
bravest
soldier
Ex-soldier,
remember?

Why
is
it,
whenever
we
meet,

That
arrow
almost
pierced
your
heart.
I'm
not
so
sure
it
didn't.
QUASIMODO:

That
warm
and
loving
glow
Though
I
might
wish
with
all
my
might
No
face
as
hideous
as
my
face
Was
ever
meant
for
heaven's
light


Frollo's
coming.
You
must
leave.
Quick,
follow
me.
Be
careful,
my
friend.
Promise
-
I
promise.
Quick,
we
gotta
stash
the
stiff.


Oh.
Oh,
Master,
I
am
never
too
busy
to
share
I
brought
a
little
treat.

Oh!

Is
there
something
troubling
you,
-
Oh.
No!
I
know
there
is.
I
think
you're
hiding
something.
Oh,
no,
Master.
I...
There's
no...
You're
not
eating,
boy.
Mmm.

It's
very
good.
Thank
you.



Seeds.
What's
different
in
here?
Nothing.
Sir.
Isn't
this
one
new?
It's
awfully
good.
I
know
you
helped
her
escape!
And
now
all
Paris
is
burning
She
was
kind
to
me,
Master.
You
idiot!
She's
a
gypsy!
Think,
boy.
Think
of
your
mother.


But
what
chance
could
have
against
her
heathen
treachery?
Well,
never
you
mind,
Quasimodo.
She'll
be
out
of
our
lives
soon
enough.
I
will
free
you
from
her
evil
spell.
She
will
torment
you
no
longer.
What
do
you
mean?
I
know
where
her
hideout
is.
And
tomorrow
at
dawn,
I
attack
with
1,000
men.

We
have
to
find
the
court
If
Frollo
gets
there
first...
-
I
can't.
Frollo
is
my
master.
She
stood
up
for
you.
You've
got
Well,
I'm
not
going
to
sit
by
and
You
do
what
you
think
is
right.
What?
What
am
I
supposed
to
do?
Go
out
there
and
rescue
and
the
whole
town
will
cheer
She
already
has
her
knight

Frollo
was
right.
I'm
tired
of
trying
to
be
I
must
be
out
of
my
mind.
-
Phoebus!
Shh.
-
I'm
coming
with
you!
I'm
not
doing
it
for
you.
You
know
where
she
is?
No,
but
she
said
Good,
good,
good.
Ah,
great.
What
is
it?
-
I'm
not
sure.
Maybe
it's
Arabic.
No,
no.
It's
not
"When
you
wear
this
woven
band,
-
What?
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
See,
here's
the
cathedral
and
the
river,
-
I've
never
seen
a
map
that
looks
like...
And
I
think
I
know
-
This
is
it.

All
right.
Okay.
But
if
we're
going
to
find
Esmeralda,
Truce?
Well,
okay.
Ahh!

Sorry.
PHOEBUS:
No,
you're
not.

This
looks
like
the
symbol
on
the
map.
But
what
does
it
mean?
Hmm.
I'm
not
sure.
I
can
make
out
an
inscription,
but
it's
going
to
Yes,
well.
QUASIMODO:
PHOEBUS:
Offhand,
I'd
say
it's
Must
be
the
old
catacombs.
Cheerful
place.

Kinda
makes
ya
wish
Not
me.
I
just
want
to
warn
Esmeralda
and
get
back
to
the
bell
tower
Speaking
of
trouble,
we
should
-
What
do
you
mean?
Or
an
ambush.

Well,
well,
well.
What
have
we
here?
-
Trespassers!
-
We're
not
spies.

You're
very
clever
Unfortunately,
you
won't


Maybe
you've
heard
Where
the
scoundrels
of
Paris
Maybe
you've
heard
of
that
mythical
Hello,
you're
there.
Where
the
lame
can
walk
And
the
blind
can
see
But
the
dead
don't
talk
So
you
won't
be
around
We
have
a
method
Rather
like
hornets
Here
in
the
court
of
miracles

Gather
around,
everybody.
It's
a
doubleheader.

sentence
Any
last
words?


-
Now
that
we've
seen
all
the
evidence
-
Overruled.
-
Quiet.
We
find
you
totally
innocent
Which
is
the
worst
crime
of
all
So
you're
going
to
hang
ESMERALDA:
Stop!

These
men
aren't
spies.
-
Why
didn't
they
say
so?
This
is
the
soldier
And
Quasimodo
helped
me
We
came
to
warn
you.
Frollo's
coming!
He
says
he
knows
where
you're
hiding,
and
he's
attacking
at
dawn
Then
let's
waste
no
time.
(CROWD
CLAMORING
You
took
a
terrible
risk
coming
here.
It
may
not
exactly
show,
Don't
thank
me.
Thank
Quasimodo.
Without
his
help,
FROLLO:
Nor
would
I.


After
20
years
of
searching,
the
court
of
miracles
is
mine
at
last.
Dear
Quasimodo.
I
always
knew
-
No.
-
Why,
he
led
me
right
to
you,
my
dear.
And
look
what
else
Captain
Phoebus,
back
from
the
dead.
Another
"miracle,
"
no
doubt.
I
shall
remedy
that.
There'll
be
a
little
bonfire
And
you're
all
invited
to
attend.
Lock
them
up.
No,
please,
Master!
No,
no.
Take
him
back
to
the
bell
tower.


FROLLO:
The
prisoner,
Esmeralda,
has
been
found
guilty
The
sentence...
Death!

The
time
has
come,
gypsy.
Yet
even
now
it
is
not
too
late.
I
can
save
you
from
the
flames
Choose
me.
Or
the
fire.

The
gypsy,
Esmeralda,
This
evil
witch
has
put
the
soul
in
awful
jeopardy.
Come
on,
Quasi.
Snap
out
of
it!
-
Your
friends
are
down
there.
You
gotta
break
these
chains.
I
can't.
I
tried.
-
But
you
can't
let
Frollo
win!
So
you're
givin'
up?
That's
it?
These
chains
aren't
what's
Leave
me
alone.
Okay.
Okay,
Quasi.
After
all,
we're
only
made
out
of
stone.
We
just
thought
maybe
FROLLO:
For
justice,
for
Paris,
and
for
her
own
salvation,
it
is
my
sacred
duty
back
where
she
belongs.
No!








Quasimodo!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
-
Captain.
Seize
the
cathedral.
Don't
worry.
You'll
be
safe
here.
SOLDIER:
Charge!

Come
back,
you
cowards!
You,
men,
pick
up
that
beam.
Alone
at
last.


Citizens
of
Paris!
Frollo
has
persecuted
our
people,
Now
he
has
declared
war

Will
we
allow
it?




I
think
the
cavalry
is
here.
Hey,
isn't
that...
-
Uh,
Feeble?
Phoebus!



Sorry.
Sorry.



Harder!

Oh!
I'm
free!
I'm
free!

Dang
it!

VICTOR:
Ready,
aim,
fire!

Are
you
sure
that's
how
it
works?

Works
for
me.


Achilles,
sit.

Fly,
my
pretties!
Fly,
fly!



Put
your
backs
into
it!


Frollo,
have
you
gone
mad?
I
will
not
tolerate
Silence,
you
old
fool!
The
hunchback
and
I
And
this
time
you
will
not
interfere.
We've
done
it,
Esmeralda!
Come
and
see.
Esmeralda,
wake
up.
You're
safe
now.
Esmeralda?
Oh,
no.
Oh,
no.

You
killed
her.
It
was
my
duty,
horrible
as
it
was.
There,
there,
Quasimodo.
But
now
the
time
has
come
Forever.


Now,
now,
listen
to
me,
Quasimodo.
No,
you
listen!
All
my
life,
you
have
told
me
But
now
I
see
that
the
only
thing
dark
Quasimodo?
Esmeralda!
She
lives.
No!

Leaving
so
soon?

Look,
up
there!
Hang
on!



I
should
have
known
you'd
risk
your
life
just
as
your
own
mother
What?
Now
I'm
going
to
do

Whoa!

Oh!




Hold
on.
ESMERALDA:
Hold
on.

And
he
shall
smite
the
wicked



Quasimodo!
Quasi!
No!




Three
cheers
for
Quasimodo!


So
here
is
a
riddle
Sing

Till
then
On
days
when
the
sun
is
gone
We'll
hang
on
And
we'll
wish
upon
the
moon
Whoa-oh

Seems
