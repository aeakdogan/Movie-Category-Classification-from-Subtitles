last
time
Our

Let
me
guess.
Met

Monday.
Pretty
much.
Me,
too.
I'll
bet
we
don't
I'd
recognize
her


I
find
the
pheasant

I

the
pheasant
How
do
you
find
I

Betty?
I
prefer

Paul?
Paul!
When
I
didn't
see
you
I
didn't
know
you
were
Didn't
you
get
I
started
but
after
the
first
few,
I
couldn't
bear
to
hear
and
the
killing.
I
wrote
you
almost
I
know.
See?
Oh,
Paul,
even
the
thought
of
you
it
was
just
too
much.
I
knew
if
I
got
them,
That's
all
that
you
were
alive...
safe.
That's
all
that
was
Can
you
forgive
me?
Yeah,
sure.
I
wrote
to
you.
Got
a
few.
I
told
you
I
quite
agree
It's
a
course
I'm
taking.
Self-improvement.
His
name's

The
whole
country's

You've
been
away,
You
don't

I
went
to
make
sure
Mr.
Sweeney
He
said

start
Just

sure
Who
could
resist
Of
course
Betty,
I
don't
want
You've
got
No...
I
don't.
But,
you
know...
I
had
time
to
think
about
about
what
I
want
for
me,
for
us.
I
wrote
you
all
this
Are
we
back
to
those
You
want
me
to
read
No.
It's
just
you'd
understand
what
I
want.
Sweetie...
Tell
me
what
you
want.
I
thought...
some
time.
Time's
money.
I
want
things,
Paulie.
My
whole
life
I
want
things.
Don't
you
want...
things?

And
you'll
wear
your
uniform,
My
uniform?
To
sell
chocolates...
millions
and
millions
Won't
you?
Yes.

Here,
let
me
help.
I'm
sorry.
He's
going
to
kill
me.
It's
just
glass.
Sorry.
No,

it's
my
fault.
Look
at
this
mess.
Here

Are
you
all
right?

No.
Phew!
Hi.

I'm
so
embarrassed.
I
wanted
to
apologize,
but
you
looked
Apology

Quite
a
mouthful.
It's
required
reading.
College?
My
master's
degree.
Playing
hooky?
No.
I'm
going
home.
My
family
And
you?
Uh,
business
The
train
goes
My
ticket
didn't.
I
mean,
it
did
but...
Oh,
no.
I
think
this
is
yours.
Yup.
I
thought
it
was
a
mistake.

Is
this
seat
taken?
How
are
you?
Look,
uh,
I'm
Bill.
This
is
my
buddy
And
you're,
uh...
Not
interested.
Ooh.
I
had
that
always
she
was
It
was
never
what
she
meant,
Most
definitely
not.
Not
after
she
Stop
it.
Fellas.
Fellas.
Lady
doesn't
want
Just
let
her
be.
Oh,
now
what
are
we
Shut

I
think
I
got

get
Not

this
bus,

I
don't
think
I'm
Paul
Sutton.
Victoria
Aragon.
I'm
sorry
Um...
I
feel
terrible.
All
the
problems
You
should
just
Who
knows
what
There's
always
of
a
forest
fire,
Why
aren't
you
My
stop.
You're
waiting
No.
No.
A
miracle.
He's
going
to
kill
me.
Who?
My
father.
If
you're
still
worried
It's
not
about
Oh,
God.
Look,
it's
none
but
if
you'd
like
''I
was
not
meant
''not
meant
to
be
I'm
a...
Who's
a
free
spirit?
My
professor.
He
and
I
were...
We--We
were...
I
don't
think
just
because
broke
up
with
you--
I'm
pregnant.
Oh.
You're
very
upset.
I
can
understand
that.
Definitely
understand
that.
But,
Victoria,
It's
a
new
life
That's
a
miracle
''I
will
kill
anyone
How
many
times
A
hundred
times,
I'm
sure
it's
just
My
father
means
Always.
He's--He's
very
If
I
come
home
this
way
he'll
kill
me.
I
know
he
will.
How
about
if
you
do
show
up
Who
does
what,
comes
for
the
day
Sure.
Comes
to
meet
the
family,
leaves
in
the
morning,
writes
a
letter
Abandoned
me.
It
happens.
You're
very
kind
Maybe
it
might
work...
but...
there's
nobody.
Miss
Aragon.
Victoria.
There's
me.
Was
it
horrible,
Once
the
shooting
starts,
The
trick
was
to
get
your
mind
What
did
you
do?
Write
letters
In
my
head.
Then
later,
I
would
About
the
war.
About
what
I'd
like
The
perfect
little
house,
kids
running
around
great
job.
She
must
have
cherished
Yeah,
every
word.
You're
very
kind
And
the
baby.
I'm
doing
it
Then
we
both
thank
you.
You're
both
welcome.
We
call
it
Las
Nubes.
It
means
the
clouds.
It's
beautiful.
Yeah.
Well,
if
we're
going

Marie!
It'll
be
O.K.
Like
hell
I
will
not
I'll

to
the
pope
to
get
this
undone.
We
weren't
married
Marie!
Qu

Alberto?
Mama.
Victoria!
Cul

Here
is
the
problem.
Is
this
how
To
betray
Betray
your
father?
I
did
not
betray
What
are
you
What
do
you
think
The

His

Abuelita.
I

now,
this
will
not

I
swear
before
God.
Alberto!
You
are
so
unfair.
Me?
Ha

Sure.
Of
course.
Help

Huh?
Ugh!
Cierra

Why

never
just
say,
''I'm
happy
for
you.
Why
must
everything
It's
a
bit
Not
for
Grandma
Not
for
you.
Why
is
he
I
hate
him!
Victoria!
He
is
your
father.
He

Even
as
a
child,
Only
with
the
vines
Maybe
he
should
have
That
would
be
nice
You
could
have
A
call,
a
letter
I
wanted
to
surprise
you.
Well,
you
certainly
He
wants
me
to
marry
I
have
never
even
met
just
because
he
has

It's

Ooh!
What
a
delicate
ring.
You
are
beautiful
Marriage

Mama?
Dear
God,

this
food
and
bless
the
harvest
in
your
wisdom
-
Amen.
Bon
appetit.
This
is
pumpkin
It's
a
specialty
It's
delicious.
It's
been
in
the
family
before
your
Declaration
So,
with
all
the
commotion,
we
never
heard
the
whole
story
I
was
on
leave
in
June.
July.
Just
after
I
moved
That's
right.July.
At
the
USO.
I
didn't
know
Um...
I
wasn't
actually
Then
what
were
you
doing
in
a
hall
filled
Pedro.
Mi
abuelo
vivi
a--
Excuse
me.
My
grandfather
lived
and
he
used
salt
My
great-grandfather
So,
tell
us,
Mr.
Sutton,
since
we
now
have
such
a
clear
picture
where
are
you
from?
Moline.
Moline,
Illinois.
Mmm.
Wherever
that
is.
It's
in
the
middle
Exactly
in
the
middle,
Right.
And
your
parents,
they
are
I
never
knew
my
parents.
Oh.
Who
brought
you
up,
the
fairies?
I
grew
up
in
a
home.
Whose
home?
I
meant
an
orphanage.
Wonderful.
This
is
just
wonderful.
My
daughter
back
400
years
to
some
of
the
finest
families
and
you
are
telling
me
she
has
married
a
man
Or
worse...
a
man
with
no
past
and
no
future!
Wonderful.
You
don't
know
You
don't
know
Do
you?
Yes.
I
know
he
knows
I
know
he
wants
a
house
A
great
job.
You
mean,
Excuse
me.
It
was
very
good.
Thank
you.
He
doesn't
pull
I'm
sorry.
You
must
think
When
I
was
a
kid...
every
night
I'd
climb
and
I'd
make
a
wish
That's
a
lot
of
wishing.
It
usually
boiled
down
What
was
that?
What
you
have
in
there.
Everyone
always
how
you
should
Better
than
having
I
don't
know
I
do.
That's
no
reason
No.
And
I
was
going
I
thought,
''A
strange
man
''tells
me
he's
married
and
I'm
the
last
to
know?''
Probably
act
the
same
way.
No,
you
wouldn't.
I
don't
know
I
do.
It's
only
another
I'll
be
back
Anyway,
I
think
This
bed
when
I
married
It
was
my
grandmother's
Her
dowry.
She
had
it
brought
He
was
a
diplomat,
And
this
is
our
first
my
mother...
my
grandmother...
and
me.
We
can
sleep
In
that
teeny-tiny
on
your
Ay,
hija,
no.
You
need
room...
to
maneuver.
Mommy!
I
know
this
is
not
but
I
would
like
It's
just
that
all
our
marriages
You
know,
that
my
husband
roars
so.
We
are
very
traditional
and
this
modern
world
He'll
come
around.
Love
each
other...
always.

Ha!
First
he
comes
into
my
house,
And
now...
No!
Vida...
You
don't
want
to
see
it,
but
your
daughter
And
she
was
not
stolen
any
more
Or
have
you
forgotten
in
my
father's
house,
hmm?
I
asked
for
with
respect.
Who
is
he?
He
is
nobody.
He
is
her
choice,
Alberto,
it
is
from
us
If
we
don't
have
how
can
we
have
confidence
First
you
go
so
they
won't
go
to
bed
thinking
that
you're
But
I
am!
Shh!
I
am
furious

You
should
smile
more.
You
are
so
handsome
First
go
Go.
Do
you
like
No,
not
really.
Why
are
you
It's
part
of
I'd
use
try
and
figure
But
you
have
things
It's
not
that
easy.
It's
complicated.
It
doesn't
sound
You're
not
married.
I'm
sorry.
It's
just
not
a
good
time
You've
been
wonderful...
more
than
wonderful.
Would
you
There'll
be
someone
You
don't
have
to
No,
I
believe
that.
I
believe
that
there's
someone
who'll
love
you
Would
you
marry
if
it
wasn't
your
baby
If
I
loved
her.
Good
night.
Good
night.

May
I?
One
moment,
Papa.
Your
mother
good
night.
Good
night,
Papa.
Good
night,
Good
night.

Does
the
door
No.
Do
you
think
I
don't
know.
Better
not
take
In
case
he
comes
back,
Yes.
Good
night.
Aah!
Victoria!
Victoria!
Aah!
It's
all
right.
It's
all
right.
Just
a
dream.
It's
nothing.
Must
be
the
change...
coming
home,

What's
the
matter?
Frost!

Alberto...
what
you
think?
It
doesn't
reach
We
can
still
We
have
a
chance.
S,
Don
Alberto.
How
can
I
help?
Do
you
know
If
you'll
show
me.
We
are
going
to
and
you
want
me
Look.
Spread
out.

Like
a
butterfly.
If
you're
going

That's
it.
Come

With
me.
The
bus
doesn't
leave
Then
it's
daylight.
It's
better
this
way.
Less
questions.
Yes.
I
wish
you
You,
too.

580,
came
from
Spain

a
dream
the
clothes
and
the
root
inside
his
pocket.
Excuse
me.
May
I...see
one
more?
Which
one?
Ah,

no
good.
Try
one
more.
Ahh...
That's
wonderful.
Ha

is
the
root
a
descendant

Pedro
All
our
vines
come
from
this
one.
It's
not
just
It's
the
root...
of
our
lives,
of
Victoria's
life.
Now
that
you're
a
part
of
us,
it
is
the
root
You
are
an
orphan
no
longer.
So...
you
will
stay
while
we
harvest
Ah...
It's
a
special
time.
It's
a
time
of...magic.
I
really
can't.
I
have
commitments.
What
about
the
commitments
W-What
can
be
I
would
like
to,
But
I
can't.
He
said
you...
would
not
stay.
Who
did?
Alberto.
He
said,
''The
first
chance
he
will
leave
her.''
His
exact
words.
I'm
not
leaving
her.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Just
my...
poor
granddaughter.
He
will
whip
her
She'll
be
the
one
Such
a
pity.
Such
a
sweet
girl.
But

would
The
most
important
day

will

the
rest

know...
my
son.

Eh?
You're
right.
It's
only
one
day.
I'll
stay.
Right.

a
good
thing.
You
have
no
more

want
you
more
than
anything,
You
can't
imagine
But
I'm

free.
And

I
won't.
I'm

I'm
sorry.

Where

We

money
Hi,
Paul.
Hi,
Pedro.
So

About
what?
Modernizing
The
limited
You
take
in
a
partner,
You
can
always
borrow
Listen,just
because

give
you
Stick
to
your
candy,
and
keep
your
nose
Now...
tell
me
what's
that
you
sleep
the
next
You'll
use
any
excuse
won't
you?
There
is
something
This
whole
thing
A
girl
comes
home
with
a
husband
with
her
suitcases
like
she
has
Where's
my
hat?
You
don't
want
me
I'll
leave.
Is
that
I
want
the
truth.
That's
what
I
want.
No,
you
don't.
The
only
truth
you
want
is
the
truth
That's
the
only
truth
Try
me.
The
truth
is,
because
she
loves
I
told
you...
stay
out
of
She
is
my
business.
You
were
looking


Seora!
Seora.
I
appreciate
it
but
I
don't
It
smells.
I
know,
but
I
have
to
leave.
I
have
business.
Don
Pedro
has
And
besides,
you
See
what
through?
Your
fate...
what
brought
Nothing
I
brought
me
here.
Ah.
-

Oh!
Ohhh...
What's
wrong?
Nothing.
Here,
let
me
No.
We
had
a
plan.
You
were
going
to

go
back
We
should
stick
I
can't
leave
you
And
tomorrow?
Will
you
stay
And
the
day
Go
home,
Paul.
You
still
Leave
it
Victoria,
please--
You
can't
help
me
No
one
can
help
me.
It's
not
It's
not
my
problem.
I
can't
leave.

Victoria!
Victoria?
Victoria!
Don't
think
that
just
because
any
of
this
if
you
married
her
What's
that
I
wasn't
there.
I
didn't
see
a
wedding.
I
didn't
even
see
And
don't
think
that
just
because
I
think
For
four
years
to
do
what
I
had
to
do,
I
had
to
keep
myself
What's
your
reason?
What
the
hell
Reason
for
what?
For
shutting
your
daughter
Can't
you
see
How
alive?
My
whole
life,
I've
dreamed
of
getting
your
daughter
I
would
die
Why
can't
you
She's
so
easy
to
love.
You
know
nothing
You
hear
me?
Nothing!
I
know
that
she
is
and
deserves
all
the
love
Can't
you
see
that?
How
wonderful...
how
special
she
is?
You
see
this?
This
land...
this
vineyard!
This
is
365
days
Who
do
you
think
For
them!
All
of
them!
You
should
let
them
Paul.
Hey,
Paul.
Hey.
Brandy.
Ohhh...
The
finest.
I
made
it
Huh?
21
years
ago.
The
secret
is
age.
The
secret
of
everything...
Ha
ha
ha
ha!
is
age.
Hija...
Are
you
all
right?
He
only
He
will
come
back.

What

hell
My
uniform.
Ah.
Of
course.
Ha
ha
ha
ha.
Newlyweds.
What
else
but
make
love
Did
you
talk
to
her?
I
tried.
Wouldn't
make
Talking
between
never
solves
Where
we
think...
they
feel.
They
are
creatures...
of
the
heart.
Please.
Sit
down.
Don
Pedro--
No,
no,
no.
-
Come
on.
Give
me
that.
No,
no.
I'll
miss
my
bus
You

yourself

will
for
the

I
have
the
perfect
solution
