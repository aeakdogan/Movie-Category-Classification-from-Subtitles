-
I
know
it's
hard...
but
you
can't
just
leave
him
Why
don't
Fred
and
I
keep
him
just
until
-
Yeah.


-
Flower?
Flower?
-
What
do
you
want?
-
Did
you
buy
-
Did
you
see
any
in
the
fridge?
-
No.
-
Well,
if
I
had
bought
some,
-
Yeah.
There
was
a
fox
-
It
was
just
a
dream.
Down,
down,
down.
Yeah.
-
Flower?
Flower?
Hey.
'Morning,
Garnet.
'Morning,
Flower.
-
Did
you
stay
all
night?
-
Yeah.
I
slept
on
the
couch.
My
head
feels
like
a
jackhammer's
So
I
guess
your
father's
Well,
I
guess
I'll
go
home.
Yeah.
Hey,
can
I
take
-
Sure.
-
I'll
just
put
it
in
here
-
Okay.
-
So
I'll
see
you
later.
-
See
you.
Go
away,
Garnet.
I
want
to
go
back
to
sleep.
Garnet...
Go.
-
Hey,
Garnet.
Hey,
look,
I
only
took...
but
I
put
the
conditioner
so
I
only
need
one
glass.
All
right,
-
What
you
doing,
Garnet?
-
Nothing.
-
Looks
to
me
Well,
if
you're
going
to
lay
around
just
make
sure
-
Okay.
-
Okay,
then.
-
Is
grape
your
favourite?
-
Mm-mm.
-
My
favourite's
black
cherry.
-
Yeah,
black
cherry's
good.
I'd
have
to
say
-
Really?
-
Well,
any
kind
of
cherry.
-
Anyway,
I
better
go.
-
You
gonna
come
around
-
Do
you
want
me
to?
-
Of
course.
Or
maybe
-
Well,
I
guess
you
could
Okay,
bye.
-
Hi,
Garnet.
Your
dad
got
a
new
mattress.

-
Anything
under
five.
That's
all
you
got.
You
only
play
one
card.
-
Okay,
I
got
a
three.
-
Play
it.
-
Maybe
you
should
pass.
-
No,
I
can
play.
-
And
so
how'd
you
lose
-
Drinking
The
suspension
You
know,
they
should
measure
out
and
I
only
drove
two
blocks,

-
For
nothing.
-
Seven
for
nothing.

-
Moths
flying
around
-
No.
-
Stars?
-
Yeah.
-
I
thought
they
were
bugs.
-
No.
-
Birds?
-
No.
-
Erase
it
and
start
over.
The
moon?
-
No.
-
Is
it
heaven?

Who
was
that?
-
I
don't
know.




-
What're
you
doing?
-
Nothing.
Want
some
waffles?
-
Not
right
now.
-
Mr.
Hansen
threw
these
worms
into
the
back
alley.
A
car
was
gonna
-
Those
worms
are
dead.
Just
dump
those
outside.


-
Well,
I'm
gonna
get
going.
-
I'll
walk
you
to
your
car.
-
Dad
kissed
Barb.
-
You
shouldn't
spy
on
people.
Did
you
take
something
-
No.
-
You
better
not
-
I
didn't.
-
In
fact,
don't
even
go
-
I
don't.
-
You
better
not
be.
It'll
be
Garnet's
birthday
soon.
We
should
do
something
special
We
should
have
a
party
where
we
play
that
nobody
plays
anymore.
-
Sounds
good.
-
Well,
don't
get
for
Christ's
sake.
-
Well,
I
said
Watch
your
language.
See
who
he
wants
to
invite.
Maybe
spend
a
little
more
Get
him
something
special.
-
I
think
you
should
get
him
-
I
wouldn't
know
-
Well,
take
a
look
at
him.
-
Why
don't
you
just
go
shopping
-
I'm
getting
him
something
-
Hey,
Garnet,
Look
at
that.
See
these
big
red
bastards?
They're
decimating
so
I'm
like
an
act
of
God
You
have
a
magnifying
glass?
-
No.
They're
indispensable.
You
know,
you
could
get
lost
and
you'd
be
all
right
as
long
Check
it
out.
Because...
you
watch.
You,
like,
just
focus...
focus
the
beam.
Hmm,
hmm.
You
see
that?
You
see
that?
That's
cool,
huh?
Hey,
would
you
like
this?
-
Okay.
-
There
you
go.
There,
all
you
need
now
is
a
knife
and
a
compass,
and
you
got
all
you
need
-
You
shouldn't
have
-
They
don't
feel
anything.
-
If
they
didn't
feel
anything,
why
would
they
-
Hey,
Flower.
Hey,
I
just
gave
Garnet
There's
this
ant
war
and
I
was
helping
out
Aren't
you
working
today?
-
No.
I'm
waiting
for
your
dad.
-
My
dad
had
lunch
-
Shit.
All
right,
see
you
guys
later.
-
Guess
what,
Garnet?
Dad
and
I
are
planning
a
party
Is
there
anything
special
-
A
barbeque.
-
A
barbeque?
-
Thank
you.
What?
-
We
just
had
sex,
we're
sharing
a
cigarette,
and
I'm
wondering
That's
pretty
classic,
eh?
-
I'm
not
thinking
anything.
-
Nothing?
-
I'm
thinking
-
Before
that?
-
Before
that,
I
was
thinking
that
I
should
stop
or
I'm
gonna
get
hooked
again.
-
My
neighbours
are
gonna
think
-
Why
would
you
say
that?
-
Because
your
truck's
parked
for
an
hour
-
There's
a
big
difference
between
-
I
don't
know.
-
I
told
you
this
-
It's
been
a
year,
Ed.
Everyone
knows.
Everyone.
They
do.
Everyone.
-
The
kids
don't
know.
-
Well,
so
what
if
they
did?
So
what?
Anyway,
Flower
knows.
-
You
tell
her?
-
No,
I
didn't
tell
her.
Flower's
quite
capable
-
Well,
Garnet
doesn't
know.
-
I
don't
think
you
know
-
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
-
I
just
don't
see
you
-
My
kids
-
Well,
what
is
-
I'm
not
talking
to
you
-
Oh,
okay.
Thanks
for
dropping
in.
-
This
is
the
living
room.
You
see
that
macrame
frog?
I
made
that
And
Garnet
made
It's
supposed
to
be
a
star,
-
What's
down
there?
-
This
is
my
room.
This
is
my
dresser,
and
that's
my
teddy
-
If
your
dad
shows
up,
-
He
won't
be
back
until
dinner.
This
is
a
picture
of
me
-
You
were
cute.
Your
boobs
have
grown
a
lot
-
Of
course.
I
was
eight.
It
was
taken
a
few
weeks
This
is
her.
She
was
at
the
lake.
She
was
27.
-
I
can
see
why
-
People
say
-
You
do.
-
They
say
-
You
have
beautiful
eyes.
I've
always
noticed
you.
-
You
did
not.
I
always
thought
-
You
did
not.
-
I
did.
I
could
tell
I
thought
you
were
special.
That
you
were
so
beautiful.
That
you
were
the
most
beautiful
-
We
should
close
the
door.
-
When
Barb
stays
overnight,
does
it
hurt,
what
you
guys
do?
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
mean,
she
has
dinner
here
we
talk
at
night
sometimes,
What
made
you
think
-
Nothing.
-
Oh,
man,
I
love
this
song.
Should
have
been
all
right
Could
have
been
here
tonight
Could
have
been
Could
have
been
a
lady
So,
Flower,
huh?
-
My
dad
would
be
so
mad
-
Hey,
I
can
make
up
my
own
mind
It's
not
like
I'm
a
kid.
You
know,
it's
bad
An
engine
can
seize,
right?
They
don't
think
of
those
things
Hey,
there's
Henry
Nice
car.
Hey,
looking
good,
Henry!

-
Anybody
want
any
ice

-
Whose
idea
was
it
to
have
-
Oh,
damn.
-
Garnet,
where
are
you
going?
-
Washroom.
-
Garnet...
you
should
open
your
presents
Don't
you
want
to
make

When
are
you
gonna
I
got
you
something
special
Go
ahead,
open
it.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
It's
a
BB
gun.
-
I
can
see
that.
-
Garnet,
you
like
it?
Here.
You
hold
the
gun
like
this.
Move
your
hand
down.
Okay,
there.
You
keep
your
finger
off
the
trigger
Okay,
close
your
left
eye
and...
Close
your
left
eye
at
the
little
tip
here.
Okay,
when
you're
ready,
you
point
it
at
the
target,
and
then
you
pull
the
trigger
Okay,
that's
a
start.
What
were
you
aiming
for?
Well,
pick
a
target.
Make
sure
the
tip
is
in
the
"V,"
but
no
higher
Try
Santa
Claus.
Hey...
nice
shot.
Okay,
try
to
hit
it
again.
Try
the
goose.
Holy
shit.
You
sure
The
squirrel.
I
think
you
found
your
calling.
-
I'm
too
old
for
this
shit.
-
Why
can't
you
just
try
-
'Cause
it's
not
enough.
-
Well,
maybe
you
want
too
much.
-
Maybe
we
should
end
it.
-
Okay.
-
Just
don't
pretend
for
your
kids
or
your
dead
wife,
because
I'm
pretty
sure
she'd
be
just
as
fed
up
as
I
am.
In
fact,
she
might've
even
Because
the
truth
is
you're
just

-
Here.
Go
see
if
Flower
wants
some.
-
I
think
she
wants


-
I...
am...
pregnant.
-
What
did
you
say?
-
I've
been
to
the
doctor.
-
Pregnant?
How
the
hell
-
What
do
you
mean?
-
How
did
you
get
pregnant?
-
Well,
just
like
anyone
else.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
I'm
pregnant!
I
had
sex,
and
I'm
pregnant!
What
don't
you
understand?
-
Don't
you
yell
at
me!
We'll
make
an
appointment
-
I've
already
seen
him.
-
And
you're
going
to
talk
-
I
don't
need
to
talk
to
him
-
Come
here.
-
What?
-
Come
here.
-
I
don't
have
-
Come
here.
Come
here!
You're
crazy
if
you
think
-
You
have
nothing
-
Flower?
-
Stop
following
me
everywhere.
I'm
not
your
mother,
you
know.

-
One,
two...
You
can
do
this,
just
listen.
-
Look...
one,
move
your
foot
back.
-
Two,
one.
-
Okay.
You're
getting
it.
You're
really
graceful,
-
So
who
taught
you
-
Um...
I
think
it
was
my
second
wife,
-
Shut
up.
It
was
your
mom,
right?
-
My
mom?
-
It
was.
As
you
go
to
your
home
May
you
never
forget
That
we
spent
And
the
love
we
exchanged
'Mid
the
flowers
Come
and
sit
by
my
side
Do
not
hasten
to
bid
me
adieu
But
remember
And
the
cowboy
Carl...
do
you
love
me?
-
I
like
you...
very...
very,
very
much.
-
'Cause
I'm
pregnant,
and
I'm
wondering
-
Are
you
sure?
-
I
had
tests.
-
But
I
pulled
out
every
time.
-
Well,
I
guess
-
I'm
going
outside
for
a
smoke.
-
Go
put
those
in
the
truck.

-
Hey,
Flower.
Did
you
remember
-
Yeah.
So
what'd
you
get
-
Some
prenatal
books.
-
You
mean,
-
Yeah.
-
You
get
any
books
on
what
to
do
-
I
don't
need
a
book
for
that.
-
You're
not
old
enough
-
I've
been
one
since
I
was
six,
-
You're
not
the
one
that
woke
up
-
I
was
the
only
kid
in
Grade
Two
-
It's
more
than
diapers,
missy.
-
How
would
you
know?
-
Okay.
Okay,
fine.
Go
ahead.
Right,
you
know
it
all.
I'm
just
glad
your
mother's
-
Stop.
Let
me
out.
Stop!
Let
me
out!
-
Close
the
door.
Garnet.
Garnet,
wake
up.
-
What's
wrong?
-
Shh...
Nothing.
Get
dressed.
-
Why
are
we
going
fishing?
-
Fishing's
fun.
-
Is
Flower
coming
fishing?

-
This
looks
like
a
good
place.
-
You
forgot
the
worms.
-
Uh...
-
Do
fish
like
gummy
bears?
-
Sure.
Don't
you?
-
Yeah.
-
Yeah,
well,
Watch
the
bobber.
When
it
goes
under,
Then
you
gotta
reel
it
in.
-
Aren't
you
going
to
fish?
-
Maybe
later.
-
I
have
to
pee.
-
Pee
over
the
edge.
-
What
if
I
fall?
-
Pee
in
here.
-
It
won't
come.
-
Go
cross-eyed.
-
What?
-
Cross
your
eyes.
It
helps.

-
How'd
you
know
that?
-
Ancient
dad
wisdom.
Fucker!
-
That
motor
-
Hold
this.
-
Flower?
Flower's
room
is
empty.
-
She
moved
to
Barb's
house.
-
Why?
-
I
don't
know.
She
didn't
want
She's
a
woman
now.
-
So
you
gonna
go
after
him
-
No.
If
he
doesn't
want
to
be
the
father,
Don't
feel
sorry
for
me.
I'm
happy
-
You
got
a
clean
shirt
-
Flower
always
used
to
-
Yeah,
well,
you're
big
enough
What
are
you
doing
-
I
don't
feel
good.
-
Don't
bullshit
me.
You're
not
missing
school.
-
I
feel
sick.
-
I'll
give
you
something
You
want
a
ride?
-
No.
-
Okay.
-
Garnet,
this
is
Tara.
She's
gonna
be
helping
us
out
-
Hi,
Garnet.

-
Jesus
Christ.
Donna
keeps
buying
me
-
How
much
do
they
cost?
-
About
two
bucks.
Only
problem
is,
I've
got
stuck
up
the
crack
of
my
ass.
-
Up
the
crack
of
my...
-
God
bless
her.

What
is
it?
What?
Hey,
you
all
right?

-
Hi,
Garnet.
-
Hi.
-
Going
home.
-
How's
it
going?
-
Are
you
coming
home
soon?
-
I
think
I'm
gonna
get
a
place
I
heard
Dad
got
a
girl
-
Yeah.
-
Is
she
nice?
Does
she
get
the
groceries
now?
-
Yeah.
-
Does
she
remember
-
I
didn't
ask
for
any.
-
Do
you
want
to
come
to
my
place
-
Okay.
-
These
are
her
eyelids.
They're
closed
now,
And
this
is
her
little
nose
and
mouth...
and
her
arms
and
her
hands.
She
has
tiny,
And
this
is
her
back...
She's
only
the
size
that
she
can
curl
up
He
says
that
it's
gonna
feel
like
there's
It'll
just
be
her
moving
around.
And
these
are
her
little
feet...
And
up
here
is
her
little
heart.
It
sort
of
sounds
Here.
Put
your
head
here.
Can
you
hear
it?
-
No.
-
Listen.
Here.
How
about
now?
-
No.
-
Listen.
You
hear
it?
Here.
Come
here.
How
you
doing?
-
Okay.
-
Maybe
you
can
come
and
listen
to
her
heart.
-
Would
you
die
if
it
died?
-
Why
would
you
ask
that?
-
You
should
get
it
out
of
you.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
It's
making
you
sick.
-
Why
can't
you
just
be
happy
You
ruin
it
for
everyone.
Go.
Get
out
of
here.

Tara
had
to
stay
Wash
up
for
dinner.
-
I'm
not
hungry.
-
Garnet,
wash
up
And
I'll
talk
to
you
later
about
missing
school
Come
Monday,
I'll
drive
you
-
Hi.
-
I
came
by
to
talk
to
you
You're
gonna
be
there
-
'Course
I
will.
-
It's
funny
-
You
want
to
come
in?
-
No.
I'm
just
going
home
from
work.
You
have
to
resolve
-
She
can
come
back
-
Have
you
told
her
that?
-
I
never
told
her
to
leave
-
I
bet
you
didn't
ask
her
Right?
She
told
me
she's
scared

know
what
not
to
do,

more
than

But
I
don't
love
you

know,
after
awhile,
I
mean,
I
would
work.
I
would
give
you
the
money,
to
buy
things
for
the
baby,
and
for
yourself,
too.
