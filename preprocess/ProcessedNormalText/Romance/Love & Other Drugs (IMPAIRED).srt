Excuse

I've
helped

Can
I

God
only
knows
you
can't
do
that

He's
right
about
that!
I
already
justified
my
laziness.
It's
called
$35
million
on
my
first

Jamie,
help
me.

He's
a

got
lucky.

Yeah?
Well,

You'd
better

that's
all
I
have
to
say.
Jamie,
what
are
you
up
to
these
days?
-
Jamie's

Not

What
do
you
mean?
Well,
let's
just
say
Jamie
had

I
thought
you
were
in
real
estate.
I
am
looking
for
other
opportunities.
We're
living
through
the
greatest

my

Timmy,
He's

So
I
said
to
Jamie,
"Jamie,
if
you
suck
on
my
cock,
-
Oh,
Josh,
watch
your
mouth!
I
said
no,
Mom.
I
said
no.

Why
would
you
wanna
be
"Why
would
you
wanna
be
Because
it's
the
only
entry-level

That's
why.
Those
people
come
into
our
office
like
door-to-door-salesmen.
They
are
door-to-door-salesmen,
only
what
they're
selling
Yeah,
and
they're
turning

into
Madison
Avenue

buying.
Look,
I'm
not
selling
to
the
patients,
okay?
No.
No,
the
patients
just
see
I'm
not
even
doing
the
job
yet!
...and
demand
their
name-brand
drugs
-
JAMIE:
Calm
down,
you're
freaking
out.
JAMIE:
This
is
so
crazy
that
you're
yelling
at
me
for
nothing!
If
you
barbarians
won't
be
still
none
of
you
will
get
the
chocolate
cake.
ALL:
Yes,
Mom!


Oh,
Jamie,
you'd
be

richer
than

eventually
she'll
come
up
to
me
"My
name's
not

it's
Jennifer,"
and
I'll
say,
"l
thought
you
were
the
Lisa
And
from
then
on,
Jennifer,
will
think
that

from
then
on,
it's

Hi.
You're
going
to

me.
I
beg
your
pardon?
Sooner
or
later,
everybody
does.
'Cause
I'll
do
whatever
it
takes
-
What's
your
name?
Oh,
Gail,
that's
not
fair.
I'm
laying
myself
bare
here.
I'm
revealing
my
true
vulnerability.
Is
that
fair?
-
That's
not
fair.
Look
at
you
angels
of
mercy!
How
do
Fine.
What
do
you
want?
I
just
want
you
to
let
me
leave
my
samples
'Cause
otherwise,
you're
gonna
Gail.
No
sushi,

Knight!
Do
you
know
that

diarrhea
and...
How
about
a
pen?

-
Okay,
Prince
Charming,
time's
up.
Wow!
That
is
a
long
handle!
-
Would
you
like
a
pen?
Purple.
-
Bye.

Uh,
I
got
something
for
you
today.
Wait,
I
think...
Yup.

The
thing
about
these
pens
is
that
and
then
I
end
up
pressing
too
hard,
and...
Hello,
gorgeous.

Jamie!
Jamie,
they're
beautiful!


Hey,
Lisa!
Okay,
this
may
have
worked
for
you
I
became
a
rep
for
one
reason,
doctors.
To
meet
doctors,
fraternize
with
doctors,
So
next
time
you
see
me
in
the
field,

It's
just
awkward.
I
want
Chicago,
Randall.
And
right
now,
You're
20%
below
your
quota
for
Z,
You
want
me
off
your
ass,
you
punk?
There's
your
answer.
He's
got
toddlers
taking
Prozac.
He'd
have
rocks
taking
Prozac
And
by
the
way,
you
want
It's
the
guy
standing
next
to
him.
JAMIE:
Knight?
Hannigan's
butt
buddy.
But
I
swear,
he
starts
writing
it,
And
Windy
City,
here
we
come.
-
Dr.
Knight.
-
One
thousand
dollars.
-
It's
a
check
for
$1,000.
For
a
special
Pfizer
preceptorship.
For
me
to
shadow
you,
learn
your
practice,
Are
you
bribing
me?
No,
Doctor,
no.
It's
a
special
Pfizer
preceptorship

Is
this
a
joke?
If
you
think
$1,000
is
a
joke.

That's
33%
fewer
phone
calls
at
4:00
a.m...
I'd
write
a
lot
more
of
your
scrip
Well,
you
know,
They
spend
$5
billion
a
year
Mmm-hmm.
Instead
of
flying
me
to
Cancn
some
bullshit,
nonsense,
just
give
me
half
that
money
in
cash.
-
Yeah,
but
Cancn...
-
Mrs.
Putney's
on
the
phone.
Excuse
me.
Her
daughter
has
to
sing
on
Friday.
and
she's
playing
Kim,
and
she
wondered
-
Sure.
Why
not?
Hey.
This
can't
be
right.
Janice?
Janice?
A
26-year-old
needs
-
Beth
wrote
that
one
up.
All
right,
look,
if
a
patient
asks,
Yeah.
Can
I
take
notes?
-
Sure.
Why
not?
Hey.
I'm
Dr.
Knight.
-
Maggie
Murdock.
-
So
your
file
says,
"Kind
of
an
emergency."
My
apartment
was
burgled
yesterday,
But
my
symptoms
are
pretty
good
today,
I
know
your
Lilly
rep,
Trey
Hannigan?
Yeah,
Trey's
a
great
guy.
Oh.
Well,
I
wouldn't
say
that.

So,
monotherapy?
Yep.
Sinemet
CR,
50
milligrams,
plus
Domperidone
to
cut
the
nausea,
Artane
for
the
tremor,
two
milligrams,
And
Prozac,
so
that
I'm
not
too
bummed
about
having
Forty
milligrams,
once,
in
the
morning.
Zoloft
has
fewer
side
effects.
I'm
sorry,
who
are
you?
Jamie
Randall.
Oh.
Hi.
Intern.
So,
early-onset
Parkinson's.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
First
they
thought
it
was
then
Huntington's.
I
was
very
glad
for
a
negative
on
that
one.
I
didn't
really
relish
the
thought
Let's
see.
Then,
there
was
And
then
six
months
but,
no,
it
just
turned
out
to
be
Right.
And...
Don't
you
have
a
neurologist?
We
broke
up.

And
do
you
have
insurance?
Do
I
have
insurance.
Okay.
Well,
sure.
Why
not?
-
Great.
Nope.
Oh!
Um...
Actually,
yeah.
I
have
a
weird
blotch
on
my
breast.
I
don't
know,
-
Well,
let's
have
a
look.
Here
you
go.
Do
you
see
that?
-
That's
a
spider
bite.
STAN:
Yeah,
that's
a
spider
bite.
-
Great!
STAN:
All
right.
-
There
you
are.
Sure.
You're
welcome.
-
You're
a
drug
rep?
You
let
me
take
my
shirt
off,
Wait,
wait,
wait.
I'm
hurt.
-
Your
buckle
just
hit
my
eye.
-
I'm
hurt.
I'm
hurt.
Who
said
I
was
a
drug
rep?
Excuse
me,
look
at
your
bag!
I
don't
think
Okay,
look,
just
apologize,
okay?
Would
you
do
that
just
once?
I
would
actually
like
to
hear
someone
from
Okay.
Okay,
I
apologize.
I
apologize
on
behalf
of
all
the
arrogant,
who've
treated
you
like
a
non-person

So
what's
your
name?
You're
good.
Strong
eye
contact.
Implied
intimacy.
Let
me
take
you
out
Whoa!
What
was
that
for?
Eat
shit
and
die,
that's
what
that
was.
No,
wait,
wait!
Hold
on
one
second!

'Cause
I
want
to
know.

The
same
white
tights
You
are
out
of
your
mind.
All
right,
nothing
underneath?

-
You're
bad!
I
need
the
number
of
A
Murdock,
or
something
like
that.
You
want
Maggie
Murdock's
number?
Yes.
Because
she
mentioned,
and
Pfizer's
coming
out
and
I
wanna
contact
them
all,
Miss
None
Of
Your
Business.
-
We're
not
supposed
to
give
out
numbers.
You
gave
me
your
number,
you
bad
girl.
Do
your
friends
know
Jamie!
Because
if
they
knew

Listen,
I
promise
I'll
wear
the
stethoscope

546-2312.
Okay,
I
got
to
go.
Thanks,
bye.

What
are
you
doing
here?

I'm
all
fucked
up!
-
Farrah
kicked
me
out.
Can
you
believe
that?
I
think
she's

Why
did
she
kick
you
out?
-
Jesus!

Are
you?
Fuck!
Isn't
everybody?
Oh,
God.
Oh,
God.
Oh,
my
God.

I
can't
breathe.
I'm
having
a
panic
attack.

Do
you
have
any
Ativan?
Fine,
Xanax!
Jamie,
I'm
in
a
really
vulnerable
place

Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey,

Hello?

Is
that
the
girl
with
the
tits?
How'd
you
get
my
number?
What,
you
called
Knight's
office?

-
How'd
you
get
my
number?
Who
you're
fucking.

What'd
she
say?
JAMIE:
Have
coffee
with
me.
-
Why?
I'm
not
a
creep.

Same
thing.
Look,
I'm
sorry
that
I
stared
at
your
tits,
-

Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh,
I
thought
you
hung
up
for
a
second.
Should
I
have?
What,
and
miss
the
opportunity
Oh,
you
like
being
insulted?

Hold
on
a
second.
Ow!
Um...
By
the
right
person.
Oh,
my
God.
This
is
a
sales
call,
isn't
it?
You're
gonna
stay
on
the
phone
with
me
Well,
I
take
my
work
very
seriously.
5:00,
Lulu's
on
Clark.
All
right.
Bye.
Ow!
Why
is
your
answer
I
said
5:00.
(STANDING
IN
THE
DOORWAY
-
Very
cute.
Khaki
pants?
No,
thanks.
So...
What's
your
name?
Jamie
Randall.
Jamie,
right.
Okay,
sorry.
My
game?
I'm
sorry,
right,
this
is
where
we
come
from
You
have
beautiful
eyes.
That's
it?
That's
the
best
you
got?
I'm
serious.
They're
beautiful.
Well,
thank
you.
Let's
see,
what
else?
So,
are
you
always
this
mean?
Actually,
this
is
me
being
nice.
So,
how's
your
quota
this
month?
Have
you
had
Is
that
a
resting
tremor?
Comes
and
goes?
It's
none
of
your
business.
Happens
when
you're
nervous.
Mr.
Expert,
why
would
I
be
nervous?
-
'Cause
you're
interested.
Yeah,
your
mind's
telling
you
one
thing,
You
left
me
standing
Let's
go.
Excuse
me?
You
wanna
close,
right?

Now?
Mmm.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.
I'm
supposed
so
then
you
tell
me
that
there
is
no
right
And
then
I
tell
you
that
I
can't,
which
you
don't
need,
because
this
isn't
about
connection
This
is
about
finding
an
hour
or
two
And
that's
fine
with
me,
see,
because
all
I
want
is
the
exact
same
thing.
You
left
me
standing
in
the
doorway
crying
Does
that
mean
I
don't
have
to
leave
a
tip?




And
now
you're
thinking,
And,
"Where
did
I
throw
my
pager?"
Mmm.
I'm
not
thinking
that.
It's
under
the
table.

You're
probably
thinking,

Bye,
Johnny.
I
think
it's
time
for
you
to
go.
Whoa,
whoa,
I
don't
need
to
go.
Well,
I
need
you
to
go.

JAMIE:
Oh,
okay.
It
was
nice
meeting
you.
It
was
nice
meeting
you,
too.
We'll
see
each
other
around.
Thanks.
'Cause
he
gets
up
in
the
morning
And
he
goes
to
work
at
9:00

And
he
comes
back
home
at
5:30
Gets
the
same
train
every
time
'Cause
his
world
is
built
'round
punctuality
It
never
fails
And
he's
oh,
so
good
And
he's
oh,
so
fine
And
he's
oh,
so
healthy
In
his
body
and
his
mind
He's
a
well
respected
man
about
town
Doing
the
best
things
so
conservatively
And
his
mother
goes
to
meetings

And
she
stirs
the
tea
with
councilors
While
discussing
foreign
trade

What?
Wait!
Wait.

Oh,
my
God.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
I
know
it's
so
late.
Oh,
my
God!
-
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
my
God!
I
didn't
see
anything!
My
glasses
are
off!
Josh,
turn
around!


Hi.
Josh.
Pleasure
to
meet
you.
I
can
recite
and
the
four
stages
of
terminal
cirrhosis.
And
by
fourth
grade,
I
knew
what
So
why
did
you
bail
on
med
school?
I
didn't
bail.
I
just
couldn't
finish
college.
Oh.
Ritalin
at
10.
Eight.
Show-off.
But
you
were
really
smart?
Yeah.
The
prodigal
son,
with
ADD.
You
want
to
know
the
truth?
Hmm?
I
just
couldn't
give
my
father
Does
this
generally
work
for
you?
What?
This.
The
whole
misunderstood-by-Dad-
Usually.
Yeah.
Well,
it's
pretty
good.
Thanks.
But
somewhere
along
the
line,
a
girl
smiled
at
you,
and,
ta-da,
Actually,
it
was
the
fifth
grade.
Why
don't
you
have
a
boyfriend?
I'm
going.
-
Why?

The
thing
is,
I
really
like
having
sex,
and
I
actually
really
like
so
let's
just
keep
it
simple.
I
can
do
that.
Yeah,
you
do
seem
like
a
shithead,
so
it
should
be
all
right.
There's
just
alarms
going
off
in
my
head
that
you're
not
entirely
what
you
seem.
Oh,
no,
no.
I'm
a
shithead,
believe
me.
Good.
Because
if
you
turn
out
I'm
a
shithead,
believe
me.




Hey!

Hey,
man.
How
are
you?

It's
okay.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Damaged
cells
are
releasing
Your
body's
converting
it
to
prostaglandin,
which
is
triggering
a
fiesta

Do
you
wanna
throw
up?
It's
gonna
take
about
a
minute
and
your
natural
morphine
to
kick
in.
-
You
know
why
I
hit
you?
Prozac
has
helped
millions
of
people
making
miserable
lives
livable.
It's
even
helped
me
So
when
someone
fucks
with
my
Prozac,
You
know
what
people
say
about
me?

Why
do
you
suppose
that
is?
Fuck
you!
Why
do
you
suppose
that
is?
Because
I'm
ex-Marine,
and
I'll
destroy
anyone
Right.
Shit.
Ow!
Fuck.
I'd
ice
that
as
soon
as
you
can.
If
it
hurts
in
a
few
days,
get
an
X-ray.
And
stay
away
from
Maggie.

-
MAN:
Excuse
me.
Are
those
more
samples?
Yeah.
Help
yourself.
Thanks.
I
got
a
job
interview
today.
Oh,
that's
great.
That's
great.
That's
great.
Hello,
ladies!
No
samples
today.
What
do
you
mean?
No
samples
today,
thank
you.
She's
just
a
friend.
No
samples
today.
Sorry.
Okay.
What's
going
on?
Trey
got
to
you,
didn't
he?
No
samples
today,
thank
you.
Hawaii.
Hawaii?
No
samples
today.
Doctor's
convention.
Wow.
Okay.
Okay.
I
got
to
get
out
of
here.
You're
not
going
to
go
see
her,
are
you?
No.
Mmm-hmm.

Maggie!
Hi.
Hey,
what's
that?
Food.
-
For?
JAMIE:
They're
my
noodles!

You
already
Jesus!
My
God,
you
are
so
selfish.
Did
you
sleep
with
your
mother?
Ew!
-
What?
She's
cute,
she's
available,
you'd
love
her.
The
only
thing
is,
she
happens
to
and
hog
all
the
closet
space,
you
two
are
perfect
for
each
other.
JAMIE:
Is
she
hotter
than
you?
She
doesn't
have
a
disease,
either.
JAMIE:
Does
that
work
for
you
generally?
-
What?
You
are
a
shithead.
What?
Nothing.
This
is
nice.
Okay,
I
think
it's
time
to
Wait.
Am
I
not
allowed
to
say
that?
I
don't
know.
First
you
bring
food,
and
then
you
bring
a
change
of
clothes,
and
then
you
bring
a
razor
and,
I
don't
want
a
relationship.
Well,
you
can't
guarantee
You
might
actually
have
some
kind
of
latent
humanity
that
You
might
like
being
Listen,
I
said
this
was
nice.
Well,
I
wouldn't
want
to
be
I'm
sorry.
-
Sorry.
I
just...
I
did
that
before,
and
it
didn't...
It
wasn't
good.
I'd
just
been
diagnosed,
and
he
was
married.
He
helped
me,
and
it
didn't
end
well.
So...
It's
Trey
Hannigan,
isn't
it?
-
Trey
Hannigan?
It
was
Trey
Hannigan.
Uh...
Are
you
in
love
with
him?
No,
I'm
not
in
love
with
Trey
Hannigan.
I
was
never
in
love
with
Trey
Hannigan.
He
was...
Said
he
was
in
love
with
me.
Which
was,
you
know,
a
problem.

-
Can
we
just...
-
Yeah?
Okay.
-
Please.
You
get
a
special
thank
you
I
do?
Yes,
you
do.
Mmm.
-
You
know
what?
What?
I
got
to
pee.
-
I'll
be
right
back.


Just
give
me
a
second,
okay?
Okay.
Mmm.

Focus,
focus,
focus.
Should
I
keep
going?
-
This
never
happens.
I'm
serious.
It
doesn't.
No,
no,
no.
Don't
worry
about
it.
That's
really
helpful.
You
know
what?
Why
don't
you
that
you
slept
with
that
couldn't
get
it
up,
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Just
calm
down.
Just
give
me
a
minute.
Don't
worry
about
it.
I
am
worried
about
it!

Jesus!
Can
you
just
please...
Please.
Oh,
you
lying
sack
of
shit!
-
Do
you
know
what's
going
on
here?
Well,
your
body's
telling
you
otherwise.
What
is
that
supposed
to
mean?
Sit
up.
-
I
don't
want
to
sit
up.
All
right.
Now
talk
to
me.
I
don't
want
to
talk.
What
else
are
we
going
to
do?
Oh!
Come
on.
Come
on.
-
My
day?
JAMIE:
So
I
sneak
up
to
my
room
and
which
I
did
flawlessly.
It
was
undetectable.
And
I
go
down
to
his
study
And
he
gives
me
the
face.
And
I'm
like,
"What?"
Mmm-hmm.
And
then,
from
behind
his
back,
-
that
the
school
sent
home.
-
Yeah.
Genius.
Genius.
-
You're
so
competitive.
Yeah!
Yes,
you
are.
Oh,
my
God,
I
tell
you
I'm
involved
with
Trey
Hannigan
I
could
give
a
shit
about
Trey
Hannigan.
All
you
care
about
is
beating
him!
-
Bullshit!
All
men
care
about
is
performance,
but
they
have
an
appendage
if
they're
worried
about
performance.
Mmm.
Well,
you're
an
expert,
so...
Okay.
If
I'm
an
expert,
billions
making
a
drug
Oh,
I
wish.
It's
true.
I
read
it.
Where'd
you
read
that?
I
don't
know.
Ask
your
guys.
I
don't
know
where
I
read
it.
-
What
drug?
but
it's
hard
to
believe,
isn't
it?
It's
hard
to
believe.
-
It's
gonna
be
pretty
huge,
though.
When
I
think
of
the
size
of
the
problem
and
that
it's
growing
larger,
really...
-
Really.
You
know
what
I
think...
To
have
found
a
solution
Wow.
-
Pfizer
must
be
swelling
with
pride.
No
tickling!
Stop!
Stop!
No
tickling!
No,
please!

Don't
tickle
me
just
Oh!
Hello.
Keep
talking.
No
more
talking.
Who
are
all
these
old
people?
Uh...
Just
some
people
I
work
with.
Wow.
These
are
beautiful.
It
looks
like
a
photograph.
When
did
you
do
this?
Uh...
Back
when
I
could
hold
a
brush.
Here's
your
breakfast.
-
Thanks.
I'll
call
you.
-
Don't.
I'm
not
kidding.
I
can't
do
this.
I
told
you.
Okay,
then.
See
you.
BRUCE:
Your
problem
is
You
gotta
tell
the
docs
what
they
need.
Somebody
says
no,
That
means
you
are
in.
-
My
numbers
are
up.
We're
not
going
to
Chicago
on
Zithromax.
Depressed
people,
Randall,
You
gotta
move
Zoloft.
-
I
want
you
to
focus
on
Zoloft.
Counseling?
Here's
some
counseling.
Wait,
did
I
use
"you"
language?
Trial
separation.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
need
to
own
my
feelings.
Fucking
pepperoni.
Let
me
rephrase
that.
I
feel
that
you
should
stop
So,
I
hear
we're
coming
out
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
Where
did
you
hear
that?
Sildenafil
citrate.
It's
a
PDE-5
inhibitor.
They
lucked
into
it
during
trials
Guys
had
massive
boners
the
whole
time.
-

What's
it
called?
-
I
want
it.
I
could
sell
the
shit
out
of
it.
Can
you
see
if
there's
some
Tums
-
Bruce.
Bruce.
Bruce.
I
want
that
account.
Why
would
I
give
it
to
you?
Who
can
sell
a
dick
drug
better
than
me?
Ten
years,
Jamie,
It's
like
the
lost
decade.
Oh,
my
God!
I
don't
even
know
What
do
you
do?
What's
your
game?
You
need
an
IBS.
Irritable
Bowel
Syndrome?
An
Initial
Benefit
Statement.
Tell
them
who
you
are,
why
you're
there
All
right?
And
just
be
yourself,
Josh.
-
You'll
be
fine.
Oh!
Look
who
just
walked
in.
Now's
your
chance,
"Closer."
Show
me
what
you
got.

Show
me.
Hey!
Pfizer,
how's
your
fist?
How's
your
jaw?
Randall,
you
know
Stan
Knight,
right?
Stan,
this
is
a
bright
young
man
Yes,
we've
met.
-
Yeah.
How
you
doing?
New
study
on
Zoloft,
So,
I'm
feeling
good.
You'd
do
better
selling
him
Can
you
get
me
laid?
Stan's
one
of
the
more
respected
but
his
real
calling
is
pussy-hound.
Yes,
and
I
think
your
real
calling
is
pimp.
Now,
you're
banging
Maggie
Murdock,
You
are.
You
are.
Oh,
God,
those
tits
are
unbelievable!
-
So
not
fair!
No,
no.
You
don't
see
that
a
lot
What
do
you
mean,
"damned"?
Well,
it's
not
much
of
a
life,
now
is
it?
What
do
you
mean?
Interferon,
L-dopa...
It
slowed
the
progress
Listen,
Dr.
Drug
Rep.
You
know
less
than
shit,
okay?
Oh.
Is
that
what
you
told
your
wife?
That's
none
of
your
fucking
business.
Maggie
has
all
sorts
of
needs,
and
I
don't
think
a
pussy
like
you
Right,
and
a
married
man
is?
-
Whoa,
whoa!
Chill
out,
man!
Chill.
Don't
get
aggressive.
Hey!
Whoa!
Baby,
okay.
It's
okay.
Inter-fucking-feron,
really?
-
You
know
what?
Easy,
easy.
-
I'm
going
home.
-
No,
no,
no.
I'm
going
home.
I'm
keeping
my
eyes
on
you,
buddy.
That
freaked
me
out.


He
actually,
physically
hit
you,
didn't
he?
Yeah,
he
did,
and
I
was
afraid
He
might
have
to
up
his
meds,
Or
maybe
he
needs
to
change
to
in
controlling
aggressive
behavior.
Zoloft
produced
13%
fewer
outbursts
And
I
think
it's...
Turn
to
your
left.

Turn
to
your
left
right
now.
Those
two
women,
I
know
both
of
them.
Which
one
do
you
want
to
take
home?
You're
a
superstar.
Confidence
is
king.
Hey.
What
do
you
say
we
blow
this
joint,
Okay.
Thank
you.
We
ready?
-
You
okay,
champ?
What
are
you
doing?
Are
you
calling
her?
Hey,
did
she
go
down
on
you?
Farrah
looks
at
my
dick

Hello?
Did
you
call
me?
No.
I
did
not
call
you.
I
think
you
did.
And
what
would
I
have
said
That
you
want
to
see
me?
Well,
that
would
be
nice,
Do
you
want
to
see
me?
I'm
hanging
up
now.
No.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Why?
I
like
hearing
the
sound
of
your
voice.
Bye,
Randall.
Maggie!
You
like
hearing
the
sound
of
her
voice?
Shut
up.
Do
you
have
a
brain
tumor?
Were
you
abducted
by
aliens?
You
hate
women.
Why
else
would
you
It's
time
for
you
to
overdose.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh,
she
rejected
you!
That's
why
you
want
her.
It's
the
first
time
in
history
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
I
was
wondering
something.
Why
are
you
sleeping
on
my
couch?
You're
my
big
brother.

Here.
For
people
who
never
entered
puberty.
All
right.
-
MAGGIE:
You
all
right?
Sam,
remember
I
told
you
Maggie!
Mag!
Um...
But,
listen,
we'll
work
it
out
there.
Maggie,
I
want
to
talk
to
you.
I
can't
talk
right
now,
all
right?
-
I'm
getting
on
a
bus
to
Canada.
Yes.
Yes,
Canada.
These
people
can't
afford
Maggie,

bathroom
breaks?
Sophie,
remember
I
told
you
-
Okay.
-
Okay.
When
do
you
get
back?
-
Tomorrow
night,
late.
Just
forget
about
it,
okay?
Please?


JAMIE:
Why
don't
you
take
a
pen?
I'll
send
you
a
pamphlet
What
time
is
it,
do
you
know?
Wow.
Okay,
I
got
to
go.
We've
come
a
long,
long
way
together
Through
the
hard
times
and
the
good
I
have
to
celebrate
you,
baby
I
have
to
praise
you

I
should

Know
how
to
handle
large
sums
of
money
with
harmony
and
with
love,
and
that
the
truth
is
and
that
you
are

Looks
like
you

You
guys

home
safe.

Bye-bye.
-
Bye,
Maggie!

Hi.
When
you
end
it,
I
get
to
hate
you,
and
act
all
cold,
Okay.
And
you
don't
get
to
move
in,
or
become
friends
with
my
friends,
This
is
what
this
is,
whatever
this
is.
Are
you
done?
Have
you
been
here
all
night?
Yes.
Oh,
Christ!

Why
am
I
mad
at
you
already?




Oh,
Jamie.
It's
Brucie.
I've
got
a
load
of
love
in
my
trunk
for
you.
Jamie,
Jamie,
Jamie.
Jamie,
Jamie,
Jamie.
You're
gonna
love
me,
love
me...

Ah!
Jamie,
it's
Bruce.
Where
are
you?
Who
are
you?
Let
the
games
begin!


Make
it
hot!
Make
it
hot!
Ooh,
baby,
do
you
know
Ooh,
heaven

a
place
on
earth
Men
with
diabetes,
men
with
massive
penile
injuries.
Men
with

dysfunction.
Men
without
a
useful
erection
in
years!

Boing!
Minimum

effects,
long-term

This
is
a
revolution.
Questions?
Yeah.
Where
are
the

-
Right
here,
baby.
Right
here.
You
sure
you
want
one?
You
want
two?
Did
you
see
this?
Bob
Dole
says
won't
hurt
his
wife's
campaign
He
also
says
the
Viagra
commercials
won't
hurt
his
campaign
-
The
dick
drug!
That's
my
brother's!

Oh,
my
God!
Viagra,
the
little
pill
that
has
started
the

Pfizer.
Jamie!
Jamie!
Hey!

Ted
Goldstein,
ENT.
I'm
good.
Look,
I
got
this
friend,
He
has
a
little
problem.
I
thought
maybe...
Say
no
more.
You're
a
gem.
Viagra
is
the
first-ever
pill
It's
easy,
it's
effective,

Ooh,

a
place
on

Oncologists
are
writing
it,
gastroenterologists
are
writing
it.
Pediatricians
are
writing
it
for
themselves!
I
mean,
pharmacies
could
and
they
still
couldn't
meet
the
demand.
We're
running
1,200
prescriptions
a
month.
That's
more
than
my
entire
year's
quota!
About
a
bunch
of
old
guys
How
can
you
be
so
callous?
Men
are
suffering
worldwide


And
frustration.
Oh,
you're
my
little
blue
pill.
JOSH:
Oh,
for
God's
sake.
No.
What
about
this
do
you
think
is
okay?
What
are
you...
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
-
No,
no,
no!
This
is
too
much
information.
Are
you
fucking
filming
it?
Do
you
do,
like,
close-ups
and
shit?
Who
holds
it?

Hey.
Wake
up.
Oh!

Again?
Maggie!

Come
on.
I'm
an
artist.
This
is
work.
Oh,
my
God.
Say
something.
You're
just
too
weird.
Yeah,
well...
Hi,
there.
Jamie
Randall
here.
Just
reporting
from
bed,
-
And...
What?
You
use
"fuck"
all
the
time.
No,
not
"fucking."
"Girlfriend."
That's
what
you
are.
I
am?
Yeah,
you
are.
I
guess
I
am.
Jesus.

JAMIE:
No,
Mom.
No,
it's
not
an
aphrodisiac.
A
vasodilator.
No,
Ma...
No,
just...
No,
l...
Yeah,
I've
already
sold
It's
a
lot
of
money.


Okay,
I
really
can't
talk.
Okay,
bye.
I
thought
you
said
It
is.
Well,
why
did
you
tell
her
2,000?
Did
l?
Are
you
kidding?
I
don't
know,
it
just
sounded
better.
You
told
your
mother
a
lie
Look,
she
doesn't
know
numbers.
Do
you
tell
me
lies

No!
Well,
why
did
you
do
it
with
her?
Because
she
wants
to
Okay,
but
you
are
doing
well,
so
why
do
you
need
Okay,
you
know
what?
I
will
call
her
back
up
right
now,
Okay?

Tell
me
four
good
things
about
yourself.
Excuse
me?
You
heard
me.
Okay.
Four
good
things
about
myself.
I
can...
Why
are
we
doing
this?
This
is
just...
I
don't...
You
can't
even
think
What?
I
totally
can!
Do
you
think
that
you're
generous?
Do
you
think
you're
sweet?
Not
particularly.
Do
you
think
that
you're
smart?

Oh,
my
God!
Look
at
you.
You're
this
talented,
charming,
handsome,
capable,
I
am?
Yes,
you
are.
I
can
juggle.

Does
it
make
it
longer?
WOMAN
1:
How
come
we
can't
take
it?
WOMAN
2:
Are
you
saying
There
is
some
indication

-
lf
they
come
inside
you,
does
it
burn?
How
about
in
your
mouth?
WOMAN
3:
Jamie,
we
want
more
Viagra!
-
More!
More
Viagra!
Stan!
Come
here.
Come
over
here!
Ladies,
this
is
Dr.
Stan
Knight,
Right?
And
this
is...
Cassie.
But
my
friends
call
me
Lisa.
Lisa
wants
to
marry
a
doctor,
so
good
luck.
Oh,
dear.
Ladies,
next
round
is
on
me!
Okay?

Nice
jacket,
man.
Did
you
get
laid?
-
Yeah.
-
Six
times.
I
was
scared
that
you
were.
You're
crazy.

What?
Is
everything
okay?
Jamie...
Honey?
-
Honey,
your
heart's
beating
really
fast.
What's...
Jamie.
Jamie.
Jamie.
Jamie.

Jamie.
It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Talk
to
me.
I...
I...
Okay,
you
know
what?
Just
breathe.
Just
breathe.
It's
okay.

I...
-
I
love
you.

Just
give
me
a
second,
okay?
Oh,
God,
I
do.
Uh...
-
No,
you
don't.

Okay.
I'm
sorry.
-
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
-
A
little
water?
Oh,
yeah.
Okay,
see?
Here
you
go.
Here
you
go.
Okay.

-
I
love
you.
I
can't
stop
saying
it.
-
Just
stop
saying
that,
okay?
You
don't
understand.
I've
never
said
that
to
anyone
before.
-
You've
never
said
"l
love
you"?
You
never
said
it
to
your
parents?
No.
-
You
never
said
it
to
your
brother?
Jesus,
you're
more
fucked
up
than
I
am.
I
once
said
it
to
a
cat.
-
Okay,
that
makes
me
feel
better.
You
can
hold
me
now.
Okay.

Oh!

Joshie!
That
is
disgusting.
Jamie,
I
didn't
know
Oh!
-

Listen,
it's
not
what
it
looks
like,
okay?
Well,
it
kind
of
is,
but...
Okay,
just
chill.
Yeah,
chill.
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
I
thought
I
just
caught
my
brother
Well,
I
was
focusing
on
her.
Oh,
"her."
-
You
mean
my
girlfriend!
I'm
sorry.
Not
on
her!
On
her
body
parts!
Because
I
didn't
think
Then
I
saw
you,
and
I
was
like,
"What,
This
is
so
twisted.
Do
you
think
Dad's
big?
but
then
everything's
bigger
Fine!
Okay?
Sorry!
My
self-esteem
would
prefer
that
you
not
have
a
bigger
penis
Shh!
Shh!
Don't
be
mad.

Run,
Josh.
Run,
Josh.
Run,
Joshie.
JOSH:
We
can
talk
about
this
like
men!
JOSH:
No
normal
human
being
That
definition
excludes
you,
Josh.
I'd
literally
be
more
comfortable
I've
lost
all
feeling
in
my
legs.
-
Are
you
okay?
I'm
not
talking
to
you,
Josh.
-
Are
you
okay?
Okay.






He's
waiting
for
you.
-
So,
how
are
you
doing?

STAN:
Come
in!
-
Whoa!
Testosterone,
man.
Chicago's
in
two
days.
I
must
prepare.
It's
a
fucking
orgy
-
You're
coming,
aren't
you?
-
Oh,
right.
How's
she
doing?
Well,
I'm
not.
I
need
a
break.
HMOs
are
killing
me.
Killing
me!
I
need
a
lot
of
loosely
moraled
women
Speaking
of
which...
Oh,
you
are
a
god!
You're
a
god,
sir!
You're
really
not
coming
to
this?
You
could
do
something
for
me.
Yeah,
what's
that?
You
could
start
prescribing
Zoloft
Um...
Well,
Trey's
a
friend
of
mine,
man.
I
know.
I
know.
-

Sure.
Zoloft.
Okay.
Why
not?
-
Hey!

How
was
your
day?
Amazing.
Mmm?
You?
Me?
My
day
was...
My
day
was
swell.
-
I
went
to
the
clinic...
...for
a
scrip
and
waited
for
three
hours
sitting
next
-
What?

And
then
I
went
Which
was
closed,
so
no
meds
for
Maggie.
Are
you
okay?
Why,
do
I
look
like
shit?
-
I
didn't
say
that.
You
didn't
say.
You
didn't
say
it
out
loud.
Thanks,
I'd
love
one.
Sorry.
You
think
maybe
you've
had
enough?
Nope,
I
don't,
but
you
do.
Excuse
me?
Tell
me,
Randall,
what
exactly
is
it
There's
going
to
be
600
girls
-
Well,
I'm
not
going
to
the
convention.
Go
out
with
some
sexy,
limber
who's
just
dying
to
discuss
Or
just
a
hot
HMO
administrator
and
rub
your
head
Or
just,
you
know,
I
don't
know,
who
has
energy
and
likes
to
do
things
I
happen
to
want
you.
Why?
Why?
What
are
you
trying
to
prove?
Are
you
trying
to
show
Are
you
trying
to
stick
with
something
I
mean,
you
do
realize
because
you
pity-fuck
the
sick
girl,
right?
I
almost
went
home
with
All
right.
-
There,
you
see?
Don't
forget
your
pager.


Come
with
me
to
Chicago.

-
Keith!
How
you
doing,
man?
So
good
to
see
you.
I'm
going
to
go
off
and
do
some
girly
thing,
-
How
will
I
reach
you?
Stage
One?
I'm
sorry?
My
son's
a
Stage
Three.
It's
not
obvious,
don't
worry.
We're
across
the
street.
Whenever
you
get
tired
of
this
bullshit
Thank
you.
WOMAN:
Fuck
soup.
Fuck
shoelaces.
Fuck
jewelry.
And
fuck
brushing
teeth.

-
Fuck...
Trying
to
button
down
a
shirt.
And
fuck
that
meditation
shit.

And
who
knew
God
wanted
us
at
giving
hand
jobs?
My
husband
is
always
smiling.

Parkinson's
has
made
me
more
sensitive
and
more
compassionate.
Hopefully,
got
a
long
way
to
go
in
all
this.
So,
it's
a
constant
battle
of
and
grace
in
society.
And
to
overcome
that,

Offering
to
hold
the
kid
for
just
a
minute,
One
of
my
girlfriends
asked
me
once
I
said,
"How
about
a
new
brain?
She
said,
"My
husband's
not
using
his."
Wait.
Wait.
Never
mind.
Sorry.
But
there
are
good
things.
You
have
to
understand
You're
still
there.
And
life
goes
on.
And
life
is
beautiful.
Thank
you.
Parkinson's,
right?
Oh,
no.
No.
No,
your
wife.
Girlfriend.
Stage
One.
Good
days
and
bad
days,
huh?
Mostly
good
days.
You?
Wife.
Since
'73.
Stage
Four.
You
got
any
advice?
-
You
don't
need
my
advice.
My
advice
is
to
go
upstairs,
Find
yourself
a
healthy
woman.
I
love
my
wife.
I
do.
The
thing
nobody
tells
you,
this
disease
will
steal
Her
body,
her
smile,
her
mind.
Sooner
or
later,
she'll
lose
motor
control.
Eventually,
she
won't
even
Then,
the
fun
really
begins.
Frozen
face.
Dementia.
It's
not
a
disease,
it's
a
Russian
novel.
Look,
I'm
sorry.
I'm
out
of
line.
Hang
in
there.
Did
you
realize
there
are
How
remarkable!
Amazing
people.
People
doing
things.
Like
this
one
woman
runs
marathons,
And
they're
pissed
off
Oh,
my
God,
they
are
so
cool!

I
feel
good.
I
feel
really
good.
I
feel
better
than
I
have
felt
in
a
long
time,
I
mean,
okay,
whatever,
Jamie,
l...
Jamie.
-
I
have
been
such
a
bitch
to
you.
And
you
didn't
even
run
away.
It's
like,
this
is...
Like,
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I've
ever
not
felt
alone.
That
someone
is
there
for
me.
Oh,
my
God.
I
love
you.
I
do.
I
love
you.
I
love
you,
I
love
you.
I
really
love
you.

-
Hey.
What
are
you
doing?
Nothing.
I
fell
asleep.
A
cure
for
Parkinson's?
That's
what
I'm
asking.
Pfizer,
I'm
a
GP.
Twenty
universities,
15
teaching
hospitals,
and
the
goddamn
NIH
And
I'm
sure
the
second
they
find
it,
you're
gonna
be
Well,
in
the
meantime,
she
gets
worse.
What
is
this,
General
Hospital?
I
want
you
to
feel
bad
about
it,
Stan.
If
I
felt
bad
about
every
patient
then
I
don't
make
it
through
the
day.
What
are
the
cutting
edge
treatments?
I
don't
know.
Great.
Tomorrow.
Pfizer,
you're
a
nice
kid.
You're
starting
to
do
well.
And
a
list
of
doctors,
Thank
you,
Stan.
Sure.


See
this
green
area
here?

I'm
sorry.

Tell
me,
anybody
You
okay?
JAMIE:
Take
the
Z-Pak.
Okay?
Jesus!
Do
you
really
give
a
damn
for
me?
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Randall.
About
a
thing
that's
bothering
me
The
benefits
of
chelation,
I
was
a
rambling
pony
We've
achieved
complete
remission
in
patients
with
MS...
Fuck!
...Parkinson's,
lupus.
This
therapy
changes
people's
lives.
He
forgot
"world
peace."
Are
you
saying
to
me
on
our
own
nickel,
so
you
can
tell
me
For
two
weeks?
I'd
like
to
talk
to
Dr.
Rosenblum,
okay?
Do
I
look
like
I
care?
I
don't
give
a
shit
where
he
is!
Get
the
head
of
the
hospital
on
the
phone.
We've
arranged
our
entire
schedule
and
then
you
come
and
you
tell
me...
No,
you
don't
understand.
Okay?
I
would
like
to
talk
Hey.
Hey.
-
I
am
so
fed
up
with
those
people.
Okay,
look,
we
can
do
the
test,
Randall.
There's
just
all
this
red
tape
Don't
try
to
sell
me!
Please!
Okay?
-
That's
bullshit.
What
are
you
bored
of?
Parkinson's
isn't
my
life!
Why
can't
I
just
live
my
life
Do
you
know
that
-
Don't
you
want
to
get...
You
want.
This
has
become
What
are
you
talking
about?
Yes!
Desperately!
It's
not
going
to
happen.
Apparently
you
need
to
know
That's
insane.

You
need
to
get
your
stuff
What
the
hell?
You're
on
the
fast
track,
Randall.
Next
stop,
CEO.
You
can't
do
that
I
can
do
anything
I
want.

I
know.
You're
a
good
man.
In
fact,
you're
a
wonderful
man.
Much
better
Nobody
wants
to
be
-
I'm
not
running
away.
Let's
just
go
home.
And
then
you
have
to
leave.

This
is
so
stupid.
Stop.
We
don't
have
to
do
this.
Good-bye.




Hi.
You
have
reached
M.
Murdock.
If
I'm
not
picking
up,
it's
probably
This
is
actually
sad.
Are
you
trying
to
get
it
or
just
around
it,
to
piss
it
off?


Stan!
What's
up?
What's
fucking
up
is
your
friend,
is
having
a
pajama
party
Pajama
party?
What's
a
pajama
party?
Is
that,
like,
girls
wearing
pajamas?
I
thought
maybe
you
might
bring
by
Stan,
I'd
love
to.
I
don't
think
I
can.
What
are
you
doing?

I'll
totally
be
there.
See
you
later.
Bye.
Hey,
you
and
I
are
going
to
a
pajama
party.
So,
you
should
get
ready,
JOSH:
I'm
having
second
thoughts,
Jamie.
I
haven't
been
to
a
pajama
party
What
if
people
start
Oh,
my
God!
I
didn't
want
You're
the
one
who
wanted
to
come.
JOSH:
Will
people
have
to
see
me
naked?
I
can't
even
pee
in
front
of
other
people.
JAMIE:
You
have
a
beautiful
body.
I
don't
know
how
many
times
I
have
JOSH:
It's
actually
very
upsetting

Well,
look
who's
here!
How
working
class.
Love
it.
Come
in.


How
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
do
Plus
rounds.
And
phone
calls
every
day
with
family...
telling
you,
"No,
you're
wrong,"

I
fight
over
billing,

The
insurance
companies
And
the
big
law
firms,
man,
They're
just
betting
you're
going
to
This
profession
for
me,
You
know?
Make
people's
lives
better.
And
look
at
me.
LISA:
Here
they
are,
for
Christ's
sake.
Randall,
get
up
from
the
floor!
Come
with
me.
Come
on!
Come
on!
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Are
you
all
right?
Go
forth,
my
son.
Be
fruitful
and
multiply.

The
thing
about
the
software
business
You
never
know
where
It
changes
every
six
months.
And
you
never
know
One
day

then
next
it's
top-down
integration

You
can
touch
them,
if
you
want.
Oh!
Oh.
Thank
you.
-
This
way.
You'll
see.
-
I
don't
think
we
should
do
this.
No,
no,
no.
Turn
around.
I've
got
a
surprise.
This
is
my
homegirl,
Khae.
Whoa!
She's
Thai.
And
I'm
Thai-curious.
Engine
turning
over
won't
you
start?

This
one's
come
to
tear
me
all
apart
She's
Jamie-curious.
Be
still
my
heart
-
So
am
l.
Engine
turning
over
won't
you
start?
This
one's
come
to
tear
me
all
apart
Be
still
my
heart
Did
I
mention
that
It's
a
pretty
exciting
thing
because
you
work
and
then

You
know,
you
see
the
fruits
bear...

Okay!
So,
I
really
have
We
like
Jamie.
We
like
Jamie
very
much.
Oh.
Oh.
What's
wrong?





Sorry!
I'm
sorry!
-

Josh!
-
I'm
sorry.
Stan.
Josh!
Ow!

Josh!
Oh!
Wait!
We
were
just
talking!
-
Hi.
-
JOSH:
Now?
-
It
was
a
pleasure
to
meet
you.
We'll
keep
in
touch.
It
feels
like
a
frozen
Popsicle.
Shit.
I
didn't
know
that
could
even
happen.
It's
very
rare,
but
it
happens.
-
Do
you
think
they'll
have
to
amputate?
Bad
joke.

Fuck!
Sorry.
I
was
looking
for
the
shift!
-
So
fucking...
You
know,
for
whatever
it's
worth,
this
has
truly
been
That's
wonderful.
No,
seriously.
I'm
not
even
kidding.
And
I
have
you
to
thank
for
it.
I
mean,
I
never
thought
I
would
have
And
this
is
the
incredible
thing.
Because
I
fucked
that
girl.
And
I'm
thinking
to
myself,
"Oh,
my
God,
this
is
empty!
-
That's
great,
Josh.
All
those
years
I
was
so
jealous
of
you
and
now
I
was
the
one
and
I
realized
in
that
moment
I
wouldn't
have
known
And
now
I
can
go
back
home
to
Farrah
for
the
first
time
in
my
entire
life.
And
it's
all
because
of
you,
Jamie.
It's
all
because
of
my
big
brother
Jamie,
with
the
enormous
cock

So
thank
you,
brother!
Sorry!
My
bad!
Plus,
my
Pfizer
stock's
up
40%.
-
Hi.
-
Can
I
help
you?
What
kind
of
drug
reaction?
Oh.
Oh.
Just
take
a
seat

What?
Chicago.
I
got
it.

Dude.
Congratulations!
Jamie,
that's
everything
that
I'm
very
proud
of
you.
I'm
not
surprised,
You
know
who's
going
to
be
thrilled,
Jamie
Randall
makes
good.
You
should
be
very,
very
proud
of
yourself.
Mmm.

If
you're
going
to
serve
beef
bourguignon,
you
should
at
least
offer
Or
a
Pinot,
for
Christ's
sake.
Randall.
Maggie.

Oh,
I'm
sorry.
This
is
Jeremy.
-
Justin.
I'll
go
get
the
car.
That
would
be
great,
Justin.

I...
I
was...
I
tried
to
call
you...
I'm
with
someone.
Yeah,
I
can
see
that.
So...
How
are
you?
I'm
good.
Good.
Come
on.
I
gotta
go.
Maggie?
It
was
nice
to
see
you.
You're
killing
me,
Randall.
-
Hey.
There
he
is!
You
ready
to
celebrate?
Maggie!
-
Hi,
Bruce.
What
are
you
celebrating?
This
young
rock
star
is
about
to

You
got
Chicago?
Congratulations.
It
was
good
Nice
to
see
you,
Maggie.
MAGGIE:
Peace.
Uh...
So,
I
called
it,
didn't
I
call
it?
-
You
should've
put
money
on
it.
Where
you
gonna
live?
Downtown,
maybe.
Downtown?
You?
You
want
Near
North,
man.
And
bistros,
bars,
Why
don't
I
move
out
near
you?
We'll
go
get
a
beer
every
once
in
a
while.
-
Nah.
You
don't
want
to
do
that.
No.
Why
not?
I
got
a
big
raise,
buddy.
Big
raise.
-
You're
kidding
me.
Those
bastards.
Buddy,
I
was
never
going
to
get
Chicago.
I
can't
believe
this.
Give
me
some
credit!
to
spot
talent
in
colossal
fuck-ups
-

I
don't
understand.
I
didn't
actually
want
to
go
to
Chicago.
I
wanted
you
to
think
so
you'd
want
to
go
to
Chicago.
So
you'd
work
your
ass
off
to
get
there.
-
Oh,
Bruce,
this
is
unbelievable.
I
love
the
road!
I
love
a
stinky
motel!
I
love
the
barren
back
roads
That's
what
I
love.
Why
would
I
want
to
live
That
I
pay
for?
Why
would
I
want
to
Why
the
fuck
would
I
want
to
Why
the
fuck
would
I
wanna
do
that?


JAMIE:
Okay,
so...

-
What's...
-
Yeah.
-
Hi,
there.
Hi.
I'm
Maggie
Murdock.
I'm
about
to
have


What's
your
name?
JAMIE:
Oh,
come
on.
Oh,
right,
right.
Jamie
something.
And
we're
taping
it
so
that
he
can
Was.
Kids,
if
you're
watching
this,
you
put
it
back
in
Mommy's
or
you
will
be
sorry.
JAMIE:
What
else?
Um...
Just
how
happy
I
am,
in
this
moment,
right
now.
The
way
the
light's
There's
this
little
breeze
It
doesn't
matter
if
I
have
10,000
just
this
one,
because
it's
all
the
same.
Yeah.
Just
that.
Right
now,
this
moment.
I
have
this.

No.
Damn
it!
Richard!
Richard!
Where
is
she?


I
been
drifting
along
Loose
ends
tying
the
noose
Come
on!
Come
on.
Hey!
Hey!

To
where
the
puzzles
and
pagans
lay
Maggie!
-


Jamie?

Pull
over.

No,
I
can't
"pull
over"!

Just
for
a
second!
Pull
over!

I
need
to
talk

to
you.

I
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
When
I
wake
up
And
we
will
rise
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
Wait,
wait.
Okay.
Open
the
door.

Okay.

Sorry.
-
I
need
you.
I
drove
a
really
long
way
to
say
that.
What?
Am
I
supposed
to
be
impressed?

I
don't
know.
Yes.
Look,
can
you
just
get
off
the
bus
-
Just
for
a
second.
Five
minutes.
Please.
You
guys
don't
mind
He's
handsome.
-
Five
minutes.
Five
minutes,
then
I'll
let
you
go.

I'm
full
of
shit,
okay?
No,
I'm
knowingly
full
of
shit.
Because...
Because...
I
have...
I
have
never
cared
about
anybody,
And
the
thing
is,
Like,
"That's
just
Jamie!"
And
then
you...
Jesus.
You.

You.
You
didn't
see
me
that
way.
I
have
never
known
anyone
who
actually
believed
that
I
was
enough.
Until
I
met
you.
And
then
you
made
me
believe
it,
too.
So,
unfortunately,
I
need
you.
And
you
need
me.
No,
I
don't.
-
Yes,
you
do.
Yes,
you
do.
Stop
it.
Stop
saying
that.
-
You
need
someone
to
take
care
of
you.
Everybody
does.

I'm
going
to
need
you
-
That's
okay.
It
isn't
fair.
I
have
places
to
go.
You'll
go
there.
I
just
may
have
to
carry
you.
I
can't
ask
you
to
do
that.
You
didn't.
Hey,
let's
just
say
in
some
alternate
universe,
Only
she's
healthy
and
he's
perfect.
And
their
world
is
about
how
much
money
or
who's
in
a
bad
mood
that
day,
or
whether
they
feel
guilty

I
don't
want
to
be
those
people.
I
want
us.
You.
This.
JAMIE:
I
used
to
worry
a
lot
about
You
know,
Someday
I'd
become
some
big
deal.
Sometimes
the
thing
you
most
want
And
sometimes
the
thing
Like
giving
up
my
job
in
Chicago
and
deciding
to
stay
I
don't
know.
You
meet
thousands
of
people,
and
none
of
them
really
touch
you.
And
then
you
meet
one
person,
and
your
life
is
changed
forever.

Suppose
I
never
ever
saw
you
Suppose
we
never
ever
called
Suppose
I
kept
on
singing
love
songs
Just
to
break
my
own
fall
Just
to
break
my
fall
Just
to
break
my
fall
Just
to
break
my
fall
Break
my
fall
All
my
friends
say
Gonna
get
better
Better,
better,
better,
better
I
never
love
nobody
fully
Always
one
foot
on
the
ground
And
by
protecting
my
heart
truly
I
got
lost
in
the
sounds
I
hear
in
my
mind
all
of
these
voices
I
hear
in
my
mind
all
of
these
words
I
hear
in
my
mind
all
of
this
music
And
it
breaks
my
heart
I
hear
in
my
mind
all
of
these
voices
I
hear
in
my
mind
all
of
these
words
I
hear
in
my
mind
all
of
this
music
And
it
breaks
my
heart
It
breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
Breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
When
it
breaks
my
heart
