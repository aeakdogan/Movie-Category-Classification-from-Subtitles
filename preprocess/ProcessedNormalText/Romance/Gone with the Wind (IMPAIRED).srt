BRENT:
The
war's
gonna
start,
War!
Isn’t
it
exciting,
Scarlett?
-Those
fool
Yankees
want
a
war.
Fiddle-dee-dee.
War,
war,
war!
This
war
talk's
spoiling
I
get
so
bored
I
could
scream.
Besides,
there
isn't
BRENT:
Not
gonna
be
any
war?
If
either
of
you
boys
...I'll
go
in
the
house.
-But,
Scarlett!
BRENT:
Wait
a
minute,
honey,
please!
SCARLETT:
But
remember,
I
warned
you.
I've
got
an
idea!
We'll
talk
about
the
Wilkes'
barbecue
You're
eating
barbecue
with
us,
I
haven't
thought
about
that
yet.
We
want
all
your
waltzes.
First
Brent,
then
me,
-Promise?
If
only
I
didn't
have
every
one
-You
can't
do
that
to
us!
A
secret?
Who
by?
You
know
Melanie
Hamilton?
Ashley
Wilkes'
cousin?
That
goody-goody!
Anyway,
we
heard--
They
say--
Ashley
Wilkes
is
gonna
marry
her.
-Wilkeses
always
marry
their
cousins.
Of
course.

-It
can't
be
true!
Ashley
loves
me!
-What's
gotten
into
her?
Where
are
you
going
without
your
How
come
you
didn't
ask
them
You
got
no
more
manners
After
me
and
Miss
Ellen
Come
on
in
before
you
catch
No!
I'm
going
to
wait
Come
on
in
here!
Come
on!
Mm-mm-mm!

FIELD
HAND:
-Who
says
it's
quitting
time?
I's
the
foreman.
I
say
Quitting
time!
Quitting
time!
There's
none
in
the
county
Pa!
How
proud
of
yourself
you
are!
GERALD:
Well,
Katie
Scarlett
O'Hara,
Like
your
sister,
you'll
tell
You
know
I'm
no
tattletale
But
after
you
broke
your
knee
I'll
not
have
me
own
daughter
telling
me
It's
my
own
neck,
so
it
is.
All
right,
Pa,
you
jump
what
you
please.
-How
are
they
at
Twelve
Oaks?
In
the
stew
you'd
expect
with
a
barbecue
Bother
the
war!
Their
cousin
Melanie
Melanie
Hamilton
is
a
pale-faced,
Ashley
Wilkes
doesn't
think
so.
Ashley
Wilkes
couldn't
like
What's
your
interest
Nothing.
Let's
go
into
the
house.
Has
he
been
trifling
with
you?
-No.
I
had
it
in
strict
confidence
...Ashley's
going
to
marry
Melanie.
It'll
be
announced
I
don't
believe
it!
GERALD:
Scarlett!
What
are
you
about?
Have
you
been
running
after
a
man
When
you
might
have
any
other?
I
haven't
been
running
after
him,
Now,
don't
be
jerking
If
Ashley
wanted
to
marry
you,
I
want
my
girl
to
be
happy.
I
would!
I
would!
What's
the
difference
who
you
marry?
And
when
I'm
gone
I
don't
want
it.
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me,
...that
land
doesn't
mean
Land
is
the
only
thing
in
the
...worth
fighting
for,
worth
dying
for.
-It's
the
only
thing
that
lasts!
It's
proud
I
am
that
I'm
Irish.
...that
you're
half
Irish
too.
To
anyone
with
a
drop
...the
land
they
live
on
But
there
now.
You're
just
a
child.
It'll
come
to
you,
There's
no
getting
away
from
it
MAMMY:
Scarlett,
Suellen,
Carreen,
Acting
like
a
wet
nurse
to

of
eating
her
supper.
Got
no
business
wearing
herself
out....
Pork!
Take
the
lamp
Wearing
herself
out.
Waiting
on
them
poor
white
trash.
Shut
up,
dog!
Get
up
from
there!
Get
out
there
and
get
PORK:
It's
all
right,
Pork.
I'm
home.
WILKERSON:
Mrs.
O'Hara,
we
finished
What
do
you
want
me
Mr.
Wilkerson,
I've
just
come
Your
child
has
been
born.
My
child,
ma'am?
Has
been
born
and
Good
night,
Mr.
Wilkerson.
MAMMY:
I
fix
your
supper
myself
-Yes,
after
prayers,
Mammy.
Mr.
O'Hara,
you
must
Dismiss
him,
Mrs.
O'Hara?
He
must
go
tomorrow
morning,
-No.
The
Yankee
Wilkerson
and

discuss
it
later,
Mr.
O'Hara.
SUELLEN:
Scarlett's
dress
Can't
she
wear
my
pink
dress?
I
don't
like
your
tone,
Suellen.
CARREEN:
Can't
I
stay
up
for
the
ball?
CARREEN:
Why
can't
I
stay
up
for
Scarlett.
You
look
tired,
my
dear.
I'm
all
right,
Mother.
Why
can't
I
stay
up
for
the
ball?
You
may
go
to
the
barbecue.
I
didn't
want
your
tacky
dress
anyhow!
-Hush
up!
--and
to
all
the
saints,
that
I
have
...through
my
fault,
through
my
fault,
Therefore,
I
beseech
thee,
...blessed
Michael
the
Archangel...
...blessed
John
the
Baptist...
...the
Holy
Apostles,
Peter
and
Paul,
...pray
to
the
Lord....

I'll
tell
him
that
I
love
him...
...and
then
he
can't
marry.
Hear
thee
Almighty,
...grant
us
pardon,
absolution
Ooh!
Just
hold
on
and
suck
in!
Mammy,
here's
Take
it
back
to
the
kitchen.
Yes'm,
you
is!
You's
gonna
eat
every
mouthful.
No,
I'm
not!
Put
on
the
dress.
-What
my
lamb
gonna
wear?
No,
you
ain't!
You
can't
show
I'm
gonna
speak
to
your
ma!
If
you
say
one
word
to
mother,
Well....
Keep
your
shawl
on.
I
ain't
...after
the
buttermilk
I
done
put
Now,
Miss
Scarlett.
You
come
on
No!
I'm
going
to
have
a
good
time
If
you
don't
care
You
can
always
tell
a
lady
by
how
I
ain't
aiming
for
you
to
go
to
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Ashley
told
me
he
likes
MAMMY:
What
gentlemens
says
And
I
ain't
noticed
Mr.
Ashley
Now
don't
eat
too
fast.
Ain't
no
need
Why
is
it
a
girl
has
to
be
GERALD:
Scarlett
O'Hara!
If
you're
not
-...we'll
go
without
you!
GERALD:
Oh,
dear!
My
stays
are
so
tight,
I'll
never
GERALD:
-It's
a
grand
day
for
the
barbecue.
Why
isn't
Mrs.
O'Hara
with
you?
She's
settling
accounts
with
the
overseer,
-Welcome
to
Twelve
Oaks,
Mr.
O'Hara.
Your
daughter's
getting
Here
are
the
O'Hara
girls.
I
can't
stand
Scarlett.
That's
your
brother's
business.
You
must
remember
Good
morning,
girls.
Good
morning,
Scarlett.
India
Wilkes,
I
just
can't
take
my
eyes
off
it.
Good
morning,
Miss
Scarlett.
You
look
mighty
fine
It's
a
pleasure
to
see
you,
Ashley!
Scarlett,
my
dear!
I've
been
looking
for
you
everywhere.
I've
got
something
I
must
tell
you.
Yes,
I'd
like
to,
but
I
have
Something
I
hope
Come
say
hello
Oh,
do
we
have
to?
She's
been
looking
forward
ASHLEY:
Here's
Scarlett.
I'm
so
glad
to
see
you
again.
Melanie,
what
a
surprise
I
hope
you'll
stay
with
us
a
few
days.
I
hope
I
shall
stay
long
enough
-I
do
want
us
to
be.
We'll
make
the
biggest
fuss
over
her!
If
anybody
can
give
a
girl
Our
good
times
must
seem
silly
Oh,
Scarlett,
you
have
so
much
life.
I've
always
admired
you.
You
mustn't
flatter
me
Nobody
could
accuse
Melanie
She's
not
like
you,
is
she,
Ashley?
He
never
means
a
word
Why,
Charles
Hamilton,
But,
Miss
O'Hara,
I--
Was
it
kind
to
bring
your
good-looking
Now
that
Charles
is
your
beau,
Charles,
I
want
to
eat
Don't
go
philandering
with
any
other
girl,
I
won't,
Miss
O'Hara.
I
do
declare,
Frank
Kennedy!
You
look
Thank
you,
thank
you,
Miss
Scarlett.
Charles
and
Wade
asked
me
to
eat
with
You
needn't
be
so
amused.
That's
mighty
flattering
of
you,
I'll
see
what
I
can
do.
Why's
your
sister
mad?
As
if
I
couldn't
do
better
SCARLETT:
Brent
and
Stuart,
-I
didn't
mean
it.
I'm
mad
at
you!
You
haven't
been
near
me
all
day!
I
was
counting
on
eating
with
you.
-You
are,
Scarlett.
I
never
can
make
up
my
mind
I
was
awake
all
last
night
Oh,
shucks!
-Cathleen,
who's
that?
That
man
looking
at
us
and
smiling.
The
nasty
dark
one.
Don't
you
know?
That's
Rhett
Butler.
He
has
a
most
terrible
reputation.
He
looks
as
if
he
knows
My
dear,
he
isn't
received.
He
spends
his
time
up
North
He
was
expelled
And
there's
that
business
Tell,
tell!
He
took
her
out
buggy-riding
in
...and
then
he
refused
to
marry
her!
No,
but
she
was
ruined
just
the
same.
Ashley....
-Happy?
ASHLEY:
...as
if
it
had
all
been
I
like
to
feel
that
I
belong
-You
love
Twelve
Oaks
as
I
do.
I
love
it
as
more
than
a
house.
It's
a
whole
world
that
wants
only
It's
so
unaware
You're
afraid
of
what
may
happen
But
we
don't
have
to
be
afraid
for
us.
No
war
can
come
into
our
world,
Ashley.
Whatever
comes,
I'll
love
you...
...just
as
I
do
now,
until
I
die.
Isn’t
this
better
than
a
table?
A
girl
hasn't
got
but
two
sides
-I'll
get
her
dessert.
Allow
me,
Miss
O'Hara?
I
think....
Hmm....
I
think
Charles
Hamilton
may
get
it.
Thank
you,
Miss
O'Hara.
STUART:
Go
get
it,
boy!
Miss
O'Hara...
...I
love
you.
I
don't
guess
I'm
as
hungry
Why
do
I
have
to
take
a
nap?
Well-brought-up
ladies
It's
time
you
behave
and
act
When
we
were
in
Saratoga,
And
you
won't
see
no
Yankee
How
was
Ashley
today?
He
didn't
pay
much
attention
to
you.
You
mind
your
own
business!
You'll
be
lucky
you
don't
lose
You're
sweet
on
Ashley,
and
his
That's
as
much
as
you
know.
You
ought
to
behave
yourself!
If
you's
old
enough
for
parties,
Who
cares?
GERALD:
We've
borne
enough
insults
We'll
keep
our
slaves
'Twas
the
sovereign
right
of
The
South
must
assert
herself
After
we've
fired
on
the
Yankee
rascals
-There's
no
other
way.
MAN
1:
The
situation's
very
simple.
There
won't
be
a
battle.
BRENT:
One
of
us
can
lick
20
Yanks.
Gentlemen
can
always
fight
Gentlemen
always
fight
better.
GERALD:
What
does
the
captain
Well,
gentlemen,
I
hope
the
Yankees
let
us
BRENT:
STUART:
Most
of
the
miseries
of
the
world
And
when
the
wars
were
over,
Now,
gentlemen.
Mr.
Butler's
Don't
you
agree
with
us?
I
think
it's
hard
winning
What
do
you
mean,
sir?
There's
not
a
cannon
factory
What
difference
does
that
make
It'll
make
a
great
difference
Are
you
hinting
No,
I'm
not
hinting.
I'm
saying
plainly,
the
Yankees
They've
got
factories,
...and
a
fleet
to
bottle
up
All
we've
got
is
cotton
and
slaves,
I
refuse
to
listen
-I'm
sorry
if
the
truth
offends
you.
I
hear
you
were
turned
out
And
you
aren't
received
in
Not
even
your
own!
I
apologize
again
Perhaps
you
won't
mind
if
I
seem
to
be
spoiling
everybody's
...and
dreams
of
victory.
CHARLES:
That's
what
you
can
expect
GERALD:
-He
refused
to
fight.
-He
refused
to
take
advantage
of
you.
He's
one
of
the
best
shots
in
the
country,
-He's
got
steadier
hands
than
yours.
Please.
Don't
go
tweaking
You
may
be
needed
for
more
If
you'll
excuse
me,
I
think
I'll
just
show
him
around.
SCARLETT
:
Ashley....
Scarlett.
Who
are
you
hiding
from
in
here?
What
are
you
up
to?
Why
aren't
you
upstairs,
What
is
this,
Scarlett,
a
secret?
Oh,
Ashley....
Ashley!
-I
love
you.
I
love
you,
I
do!
Isn’t
it
enough
that
you
gathered
You've
always
had
mine.
Don't
tease
me
now.
Have
I
your
heart,
my
darling?
You
mustn't
say
such
things.
You'll
hate
me
for
hearing
them.
I
could
never
hate
you,
You
do
care,
don't
you?
Yes,
I
care.
Can't
we
go
away
SCARLETT:
Don't
you--?
I'm
going
to
marry
Melanie.
But
you
can't!
Oh,
my
dear,
why
must
you
make
me
How
can
I
make
you
understand?
You're
so
young,
you
don't
I
know
I
love
you,
You
don't
love
Melanie.
She's
like
me,
Scarlett.
She's
my
blood
But
you
love
me!
How
could
I
help
loving
you?
You
have
all
the
passion
That
kind
of
love
isn't
enough
Why
not
say
it,
you
coward?
You'd
marry
that
fool
..."yes,"
"no"
and
raise
You
mustn't
say
that!
Who
are
you
to
tell
me
I
mustn't?
-You
made
me
believe
you'd
marry
me.
-I
never
at
any
time--
I'll
hate
you
till
I
die!
I
can't
think
of
anything

Has
the
war
started?
Sir,
you
should
have
made
In
the
middle
of
that
That
wouldn't
have
been
tactful,
But
don't
worry.
-Sir,
you
are
no
gentleman.
I
don't
hold
that
against
you.
First
you
take
advantage
of
me,
I
meant
it
as
a
compliment.
I
hope
to
see
more
of
you,
when
He
doesn't
strike
me
as
good
What
was
it?
How
dare
you!

And
you
were
going
to
hate
him
INDIA:
She
certainly
made
a
fool
MELANIE:
She's
so
attractive,
INDIA:
-Didn't
you
see
her
going
after
Charles?
You're
wrong,
India.
Scarlett's
just
high-spirited
INDIA:
Men
flirt
with
girls
like
that,
MELANIE:

Miss
O'Hara!
Miss
O'Hara!
Mr.
Lincoln's
called
volunteers
Don't
you
men
think
But
it's
war!
Everybody's
going
off
Everybody?
CHARLES:
To
see
us
go?
I'll
cry
into
my
pillow
every
night.
Miss
O'Hara,
I
told
you
I
loved
you.
You're
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world,
I
couldn't
hope
that
you
could
love
me.
I'm
so
clumsy
and
stupid
But
if
you
could
think
of
marrying
me,
Just
anything,
I
promise.
What
did
you
say?
Miss
O'Hara,
I
said,
Yes,
Mr.
Hamilton,
I
will.
You
will?
You'll
marry
me?
-I
don't
think
I'd
want
to
wait.
Oh,
Miss
O'Hara!
Scarlett.
-When
may
I
speak
to
your
father?
I'll
go
now,
I
can't
wait.
Dear!
Mr.
O'Hara!
Mr.
O'Hara!
-It'll
be
a
week
before
they
call
me.

I
thought
of
you
...and
I
hoped
yours
-And
it
was!
Now
we're
really
and
truly
sisters.
-Charles!
Don't
cry,
darling.
The
war
will
be
over
in
a
few
weeks,
Miss
Scarlett!
I
don't
care!
Miss
Scarlett!
Why,
I'd
just
go
around
You
shouldn't
be
around
people.
For
what?
I
don't
feel
anything.
Why
should
I
have
to
What
is
it?
Oh,
poor
baby!
What
is
it?
SCARLETT:
-Nothing
will
ever
happen
to
me
anymore!
Oh,
Mother,
But
I
just
can't
bear
It's
bad
enough
not
being
able
to
I
don't
think
you're
at
all
horrible.
It's
only
natural
you
want
to
look
young
Oh,
baby!
How
would
you
like
to
visit
somewhere?
What
would
I
do
in
Savannah?
Well,
Atlanta
then.
And
you
can
stay
with
Melanie
Melanie?
Yes.
Yes,
I
could,
couldn't
I?
Oh,
Mother,
you're
sweeter
You'd
like
it,
really?
All
right,
then.
You
can
take
Prissy
with
you.
Start
packing
I'll
go
write
the
necessary
letters.
Atlanta!
Savannah
would
be
better
for
you.
What
are
you
talking
about?
You
know
what
I's
talking
about.
He'll
come
to
Atlanta
for
his
leave
-He
belongs
to
Miss
Melanie--

They're
all
whispering,
What's
it
matter,
Pittypat?
Scarlett's
living
under
my
roof,
And
for
a
widow
to
appear
in
public
...every
time
I
think
of
it,
I
feel
faint.
You
know
Scarlett
came
here
It
was
splendid
of
her
Anyone
hearing
you
talk
would
think
DR.
MEADE:
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Another
triumph
General
Lee
has
completely
...and
swept
the
Yankee
army

And
now,
a
happy
surprise
We
have
with
us
tonight,
that
most
...whose
fleet
schooners,
...have
brought
us
here
the
very
I
refer,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
to
that
None
other
than
our
friend
...Captain
Rhett
Butler!

Permit
me.
Captain
Butler,
such
a
pleasure
I
met
you
last
at
my
husband's
home.
That's
kind
of
you
to
remember,
Did
you
meet
Captain
Butler
Yes,
I--
I
think
so.
Only
for
a
moment.
You
had
broken
something.
Yes,
Captain
Butler,
I
remember
you.
Ladies,
the
Confederacy
asks
for
your
We
aren't
wearing
any.
Wait.
On
behalf
of
Mrs.
Wilkes
Thank
you,
Captain
Butler.
Just
a
moment,
please.
But
it's
your
wedding
ring,
ma'am.
It
may
help
my
husband
more
Thank
you.
That
was
a
very
beautiful
thing
to
do.
Here.
You
can
have
mine
too.
And
you,
Mrs.
Hamilton.
DR.MEADE:
-Dr.
Meade?
...for
something
we
want
to
do
DR.
MEADE:
I'll
say
one
thing.
The
war
makes
I
wish
you'd
go
away!
If
you
had
any
raising,
you'd
know
Now,
why
be
silly?
You've
no
reason
for
hating
me.
I'll
carry
your
guilty
secret
I'd
be
very
unpatriotic
to
hate
I
declare,
I
was
surprised
you
I
can't
bear
to
take
advantage
I'm
neither
noble
nor
heroic.
-But
you
are
a
blockade
runner?
You
don't
believe
in
the
Cause?
Rhett
Butler
is
the
only
cause
I
know.
And
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen...
...I
have
a
startling
surprise
Gentlemen,
if
you
wish
to
lead
the
reel
...you
must
bid
for
her!
Caroline
Meade,
how
can
you
let
your
Darlene
Merriwether,
Melanie
told
the
doctor
that
She
did?
Oh,
dear!
Oh,
dear!
-I
think
I
shall
faint.
If
Melanie
says
it's
all
right,
DR.
MEADE:
Come,
gentlemen,
Don't
be
bashful,
gentlemen!
Twenty
dollars!
Twenty
dollars
Twenty-five
dollars
DR.
MEADE:
-One
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
gold.
For
Mrs.
Charles
Hamilton.

-For
whom,
sir?
Mrs.
Hamilton
is
in
mourning.
But
I'm
sure
any
of
our
Atlanta
belles
Dr.
Meade,
I
said
She
will
not
consider
it,
sir.
Oh,
yes,
I
will!

WOMAN
1:
PITTY:
Choose
your
partners
We've
shocked
the
Confederacy.
It's
like
blockade
running,
isn't
it?
It's
worse.
I
expect
I
don't
care
what
you
expect.
Tonight
I
wouldn't
mind
dancing
Another
dance
and
my
reputation
With
enough
courage
Oh,
you
do
talk
scandalous!
You
do
waltz
divinely,
Captain
Butler.
Don't
start
flirting
with
me.
I
want
more
than
flirting
from
you.
What
do
you
want?
I'll
tell
you,
Scarlett
O'Hara,
if
you'll
take
Someday
I
want
you
to
say
to
me
the
"I
love
you."
That's
something
you'll
never
hear
MELANIE:
How
sweet.
How
kind.
SCARLETT:
Why
doesn't
he
say
SCARLETT:
Oh,
the
darling
thing!
Oh,
Rhett,
it's
lovely,
lovely!
You
didn't
really
bring
it
Yes,
I
thought
it
was
about
time
Next
trip
I'll
bring
you
some
-Oh,
Rhett.
...brave
boys
at
the
front
to
SCARLETT:
How
do
I
look?
Awful!
Just
awful!
Why?
What's
the
matter?
This
war's
stopped
being
a
joke
when

But,
Rhett,
I
don't
know
You
will,
though.
And
another
thing,
those
pantalets!
I
don't
know
a
woman
in
Paris
What
do
they--?
You
shouldn't
You
don't
mind
my
knowing
about
them,
I
can't
go
on
accepting
these
gifts,
I'm
not
kind.
I'm
tempting
you.
I
never
give
without
expecting
I
won't
marry
you
Don't
flatter
yourself.
Well,
I
won't
kiss
you
for
it
either.
Open
your
eyes
and
look
at
me.
No,
I
don't
think
I
will
kiss
you.
Although
you
need
kissing,
badly.
That's
what's
wrong
with
you.
And
by
someone
who
knows
how.
And
I
suppose
you
think
I
might
be,
if
the
right
moment
You're
a
conceited,
I
don't
know
why
I'll
tell
you
why,
Scarlett.
I'm
the
only
man
over
16
and
under
60
But
cheer
up.
Really,
Rhett?
Why?
There's
a
battle
going
on
now
-...one
way
or
the
other.
Is
Ashley
in
it?
So
you
haven't
gotten
the
wooden-headed
-Yes,
I
suppose
he's
in
it.
Some
little
town
in
Pennsylvania
MAN:
WOMAN:



Here
you
is.
They
was
fighting
Scarlett,
you
look.
The
W's
at
the
end.
Wellman,
Wendel,
White,
Whitman,
Scarlett,
you've
passed
him!
He
isn't
there!
He
isn't
there!
Ashley's
safe,
he
isn't
listed!
Oh,
he's
safe.
He's
safe!
Scarlett,
you're
so
sweet
to
worry
I
must
go
to
her.
Don't,
my
dear.
Not
here.
Let's
go
home.
Dr.
Meade,
not--?
Yes,
our
boy
Darcy.
I
was
making
these
mittens
for
him.
He
won't
need
them
now.
Well,
I'm
gonna
enlist.
I'll
show
them!
You
hush
your
mouth.
You
think
it'll
help
your
mother
It's
a
black
day,
Scarlett.
Haven't
had
bad
news,
have
you?
-Ashley's
safe.
There
are
so
many
others.
-Any
of
your
friends?
-The
Tarleton
boys,
both
of
them.
Look
at
them.
The
South's
sinking
to
its
knees.
The
Cause.
The
cause
of
living
in
the
past
I
never
heard
you
talk
like
that.
I'm
angry.
Waste
always
makes
me
angry
But
don't
you
be
downcast.
Ashley's
still
alive
to
come
home
Both
of
them.

MELANIE:
Oh,
you're
here!
Oh,
my
dear,
I've
waited
so
long!
Melanie,
my
dear,
my
darling
wife!
But
we're
forgetting
Scarlett.
ASHLEY:
Why,
is
this
any
way
to
greet
Ashley,
I....
I....
Merry
Christmas,
Ashley.
Come
on,
old
gentleman,
come
on.
We's
ate
all
your
little
chicks.
You
got
nobody
to
worry
Come
on.
Now
you
just
...can
be
Christmas
Now,
hold
on!
Hold
on!
Don't
go
getting
so
uppity.
Even
if
you
is
the
last
chicken
SCARLETT:
Let's
talk
Twelve
Oaks
and
Tara
Could
we
have
the
wine?
PITTY:
Why
did
you
say
there
There's
plenty.
It's
the
very
last
He
got
it
from
his
uncle
...who
married
his
cousin
...who
was
his
second
cousin
I
saved
it
to
wish
Ashley
But
you
mustn't
drink
it
all
at
once,
I
meant
it,
my
dear.
Only
generals
have
tunics
like
this.
I'm
so
happy
you
like
it.
Where
did
you
get
the
cloth?
It
was
sent
by
a
Charleston
lady.
I
nursed
her
son
while
he
was
You
will
take
good
care
of
it,
won't
you?
You
won't
let
it
get
torn.
You
mustn't
worry.
I'll
bring
it
back
to
you
ASHLEY:
Good
night,
my
dear.
Uncle
Peter,
is
it
time
Pretty
quick
now,
Miss
Scarlett.
Melanie
isn't
going
to
the
depot?
No,
ma'am,
she's
laying
down.
She's
so
upset,
Mr.
Wilkes
told
her
Ashley....
Ashley,
let
me
go
to
the
depot
with
you.
Scarlett,
I'd
rather
remember
Not
shivering
at
the
depot.
All
right.
Ashley,
I've
got
a
present
for
you
too!
Why,
Scarlett,
it's
beautiful!
Tie
it
on
me,
my
dear.
While
Melly
was
making
a
new
tunic,
You
made
it
yourself?
Well,
then
I
shall
You
know
there's
nothing
There's
something
you
can
do
for
me.
What
is
it?
Will
you
look
after
Melanie
for
me?
She's
so
frail
and
gentle,
-If
I
were
killed--
Say
a
prayer,
quickly.
You
say
one
for
me.
We
shall
need
all
our
prayers.
-The
end?
...and
the
end
of
our
world,
Scarlett.
But
you
don't
think
Oh,
Scarlett,
And
the
snow
in
Virginia's
deep.
When
I
see
them,
and
I
see
...always
more
and
more!
When
the
end
does
come,
It'll
be
a
comfort
to
me
You
will
promise,
won't
you?
Yes.
Is
that
all,
Ashley?
All
except...goodbye.
Oh,
Ashley,
I
can't
let
you
go!
-You
must
be
brave.
You
must!
How
else
can
I
bear
going?
Oh,
Scarlett!
You're
so
fine
Not
just
your
sweet
face,
my
dear...
...but
you.

Ashley,
kiss
me.
Kiss
me
goodbye.
Ashley.
ASHLEY:
No,
Scarlett.
No!
I've
always
loved
you.
I
only
married
Charles
just
to
hurt
you.
Ashley,
tell
me
you
love
me.
I'll
live
on
it
the
rest
of
my
life!
Goodbye.
When
the
war's
over,
Ashley.
When

Melanie,
I'm
so
tired.
Aren't
you
tired,
Melanie?
No,
I'm
not
tired,
Scarlett.
This
might
be
Ashley...
...and
only
strangers
here
No,
I'm
not
tired,
Scarlett.
They
could
all
be...
...Ashley.
BELLE:
I've
been
waiting
one
solid
hour
Go
on,
you
trash.
-Don't
talk
to
her.
My
name's
Belle
Watling.
But
that
don't
matter.
Tell
me
what
you
want
First
time
I
come
here,
I
says,
They
didn't
want
my
kind
of
nursing.
Then
I
tried
giving
them
money.
The
old
peahens!
I
know
a
gentleman
who
says
If
you
are,
which
they
ain't,
What
are
you
doing
here?
This
time
I'm
conversing
You
might
as
well
take
my
money.
-I'm
sure
you're
very
generous.
Of
course
you
are!
Some
folks
here
wouldn't
feel
that
way.
But
maybe
they
ain't
Look,

Oh,
Scarlett,

No

I've

Melly.
Mother
says
it
always
seems
If
I
don't
take
a
strap
to
that
Prissy!
Oh,
Melly....
Know
what
I
heard
You
remember
that
The
one
with
the
uniform
You
don't
have
to
keep
on
I
know
how
worried
you
are.


No
matter,
'twill
never....
Oh,
Melly....
I'll
just
go
and
fetch
you
You're
slow
as
molasses
in
January.
-I
never
seen
him,
Miss
Scarlett.
He
ain't
at
the
hospital.
A
man
told
me
that
the
doctor's
...with
the
wounded
soldiers--
Well,
why
didn't
you
go
after
him?
Miss
Scarlett,
I's
scared
There's
folks
dying
down
there.
SCARLETT:
And
don't
you
be
upsetting
her

For
to
tote
the
weary
load
SCARLETT:
Have
you
seen--?
Dr.
Meade?
SCARLETT:
Dr.
Meade,
at
last!
Thank
heaven
you're
here.
Now,
come,
child,
wake
up.
But
Melly's
having
her
baby.
Are
you
crazy?
I
can't
They're
dying!
Hundreds!
But
there
isn't
anybody.
Die?
Look
at
them,
bleeding
No
chloroform.
No
bandages.
Nothing
to
ease
their
pain.
Run
along
and
don't
bother
me.
Don't
worry,
child.
-Bring
the
stretchers
in
here.
Yeah,
I'm
coming.
PRISSY:
No,
he
can't
come.
Oh,
Miss
Scarlett,
He
can't
come.
You've
got
to
manage
Oh,
Lordy,
Miss
Scarlett!
Well,
what
is
it?
Lordy,
we's
got
to
have
a
doctor!
I
don't
know
nothing
-What
do
you
mean?
You
told
me
I
don't
know
why
I
lied!
Ma
ain't
never
let
me
around

MELANIE:
PRISSY:
Stop
it!
Go
light
a
fire
on
the
stove.
Get
me
a
ball
of
twine,
Don't
tell
me
you
can't
find
them!
MELANIE:
-Scarlett!
Coming!
MELANIE:
You
better
go
SCARLETT:
MELANIE:
SCARLETT:
Don't
be
a
goose,
Melly.
-Hold
on
to
me!
Please,
talk
to
me.
Don't
try
to
be
brave.
Yell!
PRISSY:
Ma
says
if
you
puts
a
knife
PRISSY:
Captain
Butler!
Captain
Butler!
-Who
do
you
want?
He's
upstairs.
PRISSY:
Captain
Butler!
Oh,
Captain
Butler!
What's
all
the
rumpus
about?
PRISSY:
I's
got
a
message
Captain
Butler,
you
come
out
here
-What
is
it,
Prissy?
Miss
Melly,
she
done
A
fine
baby
boy.
And
Miss
Scarlett
and
me,
Are
you
telling
me
Scarlett--?
It
was
mostly
me,
Captain
Butler.
Only
Miss
Scarlett,
But
I
don't
expect
no
doctor
Only,
Miss
Melly,
she
feel
Yes,
I
can
believe
that.
And
the
Yankees
is
coming.


Captain
Butler,
the
Yankees
is
here!
Please
come
and
bring
I'm
sorry,
but
the
army
You
better
come
upstairs.
Oh,
no,
Captain
Butler.
Ma
would
wear
me
out
with
a
cornstalk
Any
of
you
beauties
know
where
Whoa!
SCARLETT:
Is
that
you,
Rhett?
I
knew
you'd
come.
Nice
weather
we're
having.
If
you
make
any
jokes
now,
-Don't
tell
me
you're
frightened?
If
you
had
sense,

-Oh,
the
Yankees!
That's
what's
left
of
our
army
We
gotta
get
out
of
here!
At
your
service.
-Home,
to
Tara.
You're
going
to
parade
through
there
Do
you
intend
leaving
them?
They're
going
with
me,
It's
dangerous
jouncing
I
want
my
mother!
I
want
to
go
home
to
Tara!
Tara's
probably
been
burned.
The
least
they'll
do
It's
not
much,
I'm
going
home
if
I
have
to
walk
I'll
kill
you
if
you
try
I
will,
I
will!
Shh,
shh,
shh.
All
right,
darling,
all
right.
I
guess
anybody
who
did
what
you've
Stop
crying.
Now
blow
your
nose



SCARLETT:
What're
you
doing?
SCARLETT:
Well,
stop
it
Melly?
-Melly?
-We're
taking
you
to
Tara.
It's
the
only
way,
Melly.
They'll
burn
the
house
It's
all
right,
Melly.
MELANIE:
My
poor
baby.
-Can
you
put
your
arms
around
my
neck?
RHETT:
Ashley,
Charles!
What's
she
want?
Ashley's
picture
and
Charles'
sword.
Get
them.
SCARLETT:
Our
gallant
lads
set
fire
Enough
ammunition
in
boxcars
-We
have
to
get
across
the
tracks.
We
have
to.
McDonough
road's
the
Wait,
I
forgot
to
lock
the
front
door!
-What
are
you
laughing
at?
SCARLETT:
Oh,
dear!
RHETT:
I
wouldn't
be
in
such
a
hurry
With
them
goes
the
last
Scavengers
aren't
wasting
any
time.
Better
get
out
of
here
fast.

We'll
make
a

for
it
before
RHETT:
Throw
me
your
shawl.
You'll
like
it
better
RHETT:
Take
a
good
look,
my
dear.
Tell
your
grandchildren
how
you
watched
They
were
gonna
lick
the
Yankees
They
make
me
sick.
Getting
us
all
into
this
That's
the
way
I
felt
once
about
I'm
so
glad
you
aren't
with
the
army.
You
can
be
proud.
Proud
that
I'm
not
so
proud.
Why
did
you
stop?
This
is
the
turn
to
Tara.
Mrs.
Wilkes.
Miss
Melly
done
fainted
She's
better
off.
She
couldn't
Scarlett,
are
you
still
determined
Oh,
yes,
yes.
Not
we,
my
dear,
you.
You're
what?
-I'm
going
to
join
the
army.
-I
could
kill
you
for
scaring
me
so.
I'm
going
to
join
up
But
they're
running
away.
They'll
turn
and
make
a
last
stand.
-I'm
a
little
late,
but
better
late--
Selfish
to
the
end,
aren't
you?
Thinking
of
your
own
hide,
How
could
you
do
this
to
me?
And
why
should
you
go
now
that
-Why?
Why?
I've
always
had
a
weakness
Or
maybe....
Maybe
I'm
ashamed
of
myself.
Who
knows?
You
should
die
of
shame
You?
Helpless?
Heaven
help
the
Yankees
Now
climb
down
here.
-I
want
to
say
goodbye.
Climb
down!
Rhett,
please
don't
go!
You
can't
leave
me,
please.
I'm
not
asking
you
to
forgive
me.
If
a
bullet
gets
me,
I'll
laugh
There's
one
thing
I
do
know,
In
spite
of
you
and
me
and
the
world
Because
we're
alike.
Selfish
and
shrewd,
but
able
to
look
Don't
hold
me
like
that!
Scarlett....
Look
at
me.
I
love
you
more
than
And
I've
waited
longer
Let
me
alone!
A
soldier
of
the
South
loves
you.
Wants
to
carry
the
memory
Never
mind
about
loving
me.
You're
a
woman
sending
a
soldier
Scarlett,
kiss
me.
Kiss
me
once.
You
low-down,
cowardly,
They
were
right.
Everybody
was
right.
A
minor
point
at
such
a
moment.
Here.
If
anyone
lays
a
hand
But
don't
make
a
mistake
Go
on!
I
want
you
to
go.
I
hope
a
cannonball
blows
you
Never
mind
the
rest.
And
when
I'm
dead
on
the
altar
of
my
Goodbye,
Scarlett.

Come
on,
you.
We're
going
home.



Oh,
my
poor
baby.
Don't
worry.
Mother
will
take
care
Miss
Scarlett,
I's
powerful
hungry.
-We's
got
to
have
something
to
eat.
We're
nearly
at
Twelve
Oaks.
Go
on!
Oh,
Ashley.
Ashley,
I'm
glad
The
Yankees.
The
dirty
Yankees!

Prissy!
Come
tie
up
this
cow.
We
don't
need
no
cow,
Miss
Scarlett.
We'll
be
home
soon,
Tie
her
onto
the
back
of
the
wagon
We
need
milk
for
the
baby,
and
we

SCARLETT:
We're
at
Tara.
PRISSY:
SCARLETT:
I
can't
see
the
house.
It's
all
right!
It's
all
right!
It's
still
there!
Mother!
Mother,
I'm
home!
Mother!
Mother,
I'm
home!
Mother,
let
me
in.
It's
me.
Scarlett!
Oh,
Pa!
I'm
home.
I'm
home.
Katie?
Katie
Scarlett!
Oh,
darlin'!
Mammy!
Mammy,
I'm
home.
Honey
child....
Mammy,
I'm
so....
Where's
Mother?
Why...
...Miss
Suellen,
Miss
Carreen,
They
had
it
bad,
-Just
weak,
like
little
kittens.
Well....
Miss
Ellen.
She
went
down
...that
white
trash,
Then
last
night,
she--
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?


Miss
Scarlett,
honey.
If
there's
anything
I
can
do,
-What
did
you
do
with
Melly?
I
done
slapped
her
in
bed,
You
better
put
that
cow
into
the
barn.
There
ain't
no
barn
no
more.
-Yankees
burned
it
for
firewood.
PORK:
Yankees
in
Tara?
Yes'm,
and
they
stole
All
the
clothes
and
all
the
rugs,
I'm
starving.
MAMMY:
There
ain't
nothing
All
the
chickens?
Everything?
They
took
them
first.
What
they
didn't
eat,
Don't
tell
me
any
more
about
What's
this,
Pa?
-Whiskey?
Katie
Scarlett,
that's
enough.
Your
not
knowing
spirits,
I
hope
it
makes
me
drunk.
I'd
like
to
be
drunk.
Oh,
Pa....
What
are
those
papers?
Bonds.
They're
all
we've
saved,
Bonds.
But
what
kind
of
bonds,
Pa?
Why,
Confederate
bonds,
of
course.
Confederate
bonds.
What
good
are
they
to
anybody?
I'll
not
have
you
talking
like
that.
Oh,
Pa,
what
are
we
going
to
do
...and
nothing
to
eat?
We
must
ask
your
mother.
That's
it.
-Ask
Mother?
Mrs.
O'Hara
will
know
Now
don't
be
bothering
me.
I'm
busy.
Oh,
Pa....
Don't
worry
about
anything.
Katie
Scarlett's
home.
You
needn't
worry.
MAMMY:
What'll
we
do
with
nothing
I
don't
know,
Mammy.
I
don't
know.
We
ain't
got
nothing
PRISSY:
Miss
Scarlett,
...they's
fussing
to
be
sponged
off.
-Where
are
the
other
servants?
The
others
went
to
war
PRISSY:
I
can't
take
care
of
I's
only
got
two
hands.
Who's
gonna
milk
that
cow,


As
God
is
my
witness....
As
God
is
my
witness,
I'm
going
to
live
through
this,
...I'll
never
be
hungry
again.
If
I
have
to
lie,
steal,
...as
God
is
my
witness,
My
back's
near
broken.
Look
at
my
hands!
Mother
said
you
could
always
I
guess
things
like
hands
and
ladies
Rest,
Sue.
You're
not
well
yet.
Scarlett's
hateful!
SCARLETT:
Get
back
to
work.
I
can't
do
What
do
I
care
about
Tara?
Don't
you
ever
dare
say
It's
the
same
as
hating
Pa
and
Ma.
There's
something
What
is
it?
I
don't
like
the
way
You
must
be
firm
with
inferiors,
I
know.
But
I'm
not
asking
them
to
do
Nevertheless,
I
don't
like
it.
-What
are
you
doing
out
of
bed?
You're
all
working
so
hard.
Go
upstairs.
-Please,
let
me.
I
don't
need
you
making
yourself
Oh,
I
didn't
think
of
it
that
way.

YANKEE:
Who's
there?
You
all
alone,
little
lady?
You
ain't
very
friendly,
are
you?
You
got
anything
else
You
Yankees
have
been
here
before.
Regular
little
spitfire,
ain't
you?
What
do
you
got
hidden
in
your
hand?
Scarlett,
you
killed
him.
I'm
glad
you
killed
him.
CARREEN:
Scarlett,
what
happened?
MELANIE:
Your
sister
was
cleaning
a
revolver
CARREEN:
Thank
goodness!
Tell
Katie
Scarlett
What
a
cool
liar
you
are,
Melly.
We
gotta
get
him
out
of
here
If
the
Yankees
find
him
here--
I
didn't
see
anyone
else.
Even
so,
we've
gotta
hide
him.
They
might
hear
about
it,
I
could
bury
him
in
the
arbor
...but
how
will
I
get
him
-We'll
both
take
a
leg
and
drag
him.
Scarlett....
Would
it
be
dishonest
I'm
ashamed
I
didn't
think
You
take
the
haversack.
You
look.
I'm
feeling
a
little
weak.
I
think
it's
full
of
money.
Melly,
look.
Just
look!
Don't
stop
to
count
it
now.
Do
you
realize
this
means
we
can
eat?
Look
in
his
other
pockets.
Hurry,
hurry!
We've
got
to
get
him
out
of
here.
If
he
bleeds
across
the
yard,
Give
me
your
nightgown.
Don't
be
silly,
I
won't
look
at
you.
Thank
heavens
I'm
not
that
modest.
Now
go
back
to
bed.
I'll
clean
up
my
mess
No,
I'll
clean
it
up.
Well,
I
guess
I've
done
murder.
I
won't
think
about
that
now.
GERALD:
It's
over!
It's
over!
It's
all
over,
the
war.
-It's
not
possible.
Ashley
will
be
coming
home.
Yes,
Ashley
will
be
coming
home.
We'll
plant
more
cotton.

how
You'd
be
a
sight
more
humiliated
MELANIE:
We
must
leave
this
gentleman
alone
I
don't
mind,
ma'am.
Nice
little
fella.
Another
two
years,
and
we
could've

you
in
Cobb's
Legion?
Why,
then,
you
must
know
Oh,
yes,
ma'am.
He
was
captured
Captured?
Oh,
thank
heaven!
-My
poor
Ashley,
in
a
Yankee
prison.
Yes,
Scarlett,
I'm
coming.
I'll
watch
out
for
him.
Thank
you.
I
slave
day
and
night
...and
you
give
it
away
-I'd
sooner
have
a
plague
of
locusts.
I've
just
heard
that
Ashley
-Ashley
a
prisoner?
And
maybe
if
he's
alive
and
well,
Maybe
a
Northern
woman
...and
helping
my
beloved
-I
hope
so,
Melly.
I
want
to
take
up
something
Perhaps
I
can
help
you.
Well,
I--
I....
Miss
Scarlett,
I
was
aiming
Are
you
telling
me
you
haven't
asked
The
truth
is,
I'm
so
much
...and
now
I
haven't
Who
has,
nowadays?
Miss
Scarlett,
if
true
love
...you
can
be
sure
your
sister
I'd
go
and
get
myself
a
little
business,
-As
soon
as
I'm
on
my
feet
again--
I'm
sure
I
can
speak
for
Pa.
Thank
you.
Excuse
me,
Mrs.
Wilkes.
What
seems
to
be
More
trouble
than
he
guesses.
Oh,
I'm
so
glad.
It's
a
pity
he
can't
marry
her
now.
Oh,
another
one!
-Hope
this
one
isn't
hungry.
I'll
tell
Prissy
to
get
Ashley!
Ashley!
Miss
Scarlett!
Don't
spoil
it.
Turn
me
loose,
you
fool.
He's
her
husband,
ain't
he?
-Miss
Scarlett?
-Did
you
get
the
horse
shod?
Fine
thing,
horses
Here,
stir
this
soap.
Miss
Scarlett,
ma'am?
I
gotta
know
how
much
money
Ten
dollars.
Why?
That
won't
be
enough.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Well,
I
see'd
that
old
no-count
...that
used
to
be
He's
a
regular
Yankee
now,
...that
his
Carpetbagger
friends
run
-How
much
more
we
got
to
pay?
Three
hundred--!
It
might
just
as
well
be
3
million.
Yes'm.
How?
-I'll
go
ask
Mr.
Ashley.
Well,
I
can
ask
him
Asking
ain't
getting.
Ashley....
They
say
Abe
Lincoln
Just
think
what
heights
I
may
Ashley,
the
Yankees
What
shall
we
do?
Ashley,
what's
to
become
of
us?
What
becomes
of
people
Those
with
brains
and
courage
Those
that
haven't
are
winnowed
out.
For
heaven's
sake...
...don't
talk
nonsense
You're
right,
Scarlett.
Here
I
am
...while
your
Tara
is
in
danger.
You've
come
to
me
for
help,
Oh,
Scarlett,
I'm
a
coward.
You,
Ashley?
A
coward?
What
are
you
afraid
of?
Mostly
of
life
becoming
Not
that
I
mind
splitting
rails.
But
I
do
mind
very
much
losing
If
the
war
hadn't
come,
I'd
have
spent
But
the
war
did
come.
I
saw
my
boyhood
friends
blown
to
bits.
I
saw
men
crumple
up
in
agony
And
now
I
find
myself
in
a
world
A
world
in
which
there's
I
can't
make
you
understand.
You
never
mind
facing
realities.
You
never
want
to
escape
Escape?
Ashley,
you're
wrong.
I'm
so
very
tired
of
it
all.
I've
weeded,
hoed
and
picked
cotton
I
tell
you,
the
South
is
dead.
The
Yankees
and
Carpetbaggers
Oh,
Ashley....
Let's
run
away.
They
want
officers
in
the
Mexican
army.
I'd
work
for
you.
You
don't
love
Melanie.
You
said
And
anyway,
Melanie
can't--
Dr.
Meade
said
she
can't
have
Can't
we
ever
forget
Twelve
Oaks?
You
think
I
could
ever
forget?
Can
you
honestly
say
-No,
I
don't
love
you.
Even
so,
do
you
think
You
couldn't
leave
I'm
sick
of
them.
Yes,
you're
sick
and
tired.
You've
carried
the
load
From
now
on,
I'll
be
more
help
There's
only
one
way
you
can
help
me.
Take
me
away.
Nothing?
Nothing
except
honor.
Please,
Scarlett.
You
mustn't.
Please,
SCARLETT:
-No,
don't,
don't.
We
won't
do
this.
It
won't
happen
again.
-Say
it.
You
love
me.
I
love
your
courage
and
stubbornness
...the
best
wife
a
man
ever
had.
Then
there's
nothing
left
for
me.
Nothing
to
fight
for.
Nothing
to
live
for.
Yes,
there
is
something.
Something
you
love
better
than
me...
...though
you
may
not
know
it.
Tara.
Yes.
I
still
have
this.
You
needn't
go.
I
won't
have
you
all
starve,
simply
It
won't
happen
again.
SCARLETT:
-Yes'm,
it's
me.
You
haven't
forgotten
Emmie's
Mrs.
Wilkerson
now.
Get
off
those
steps,
you
wench!
You
can't
speak
that
way
to
my
wife.
Wife?
High
time
Who
baptized
your
brats
We
came
out
here
to
pay
a
call.
A
friendly
call,
and
talk
business
Friends?
When
were
we
ever
friends?
Still
high
and
mighty,
ain't
you?
Your
father's
turned
idiot.
You
can't
pay
your
taxes,
and
I
come
To
make
you
a
right
good
offer.
Get
off
this
place,
you
dirty
Yankee!
WILKERSON:
You'll
see
who's
running
I'll
buy
this
place
But
I'll
wait
for
the
sheriff's
sale.
SCARLETT:
You'll
be
sorry
for
that.
WILKERSON:
I'll
show
you
who
SCARLETT:
Pa,
come
back!
Yankee
coward!
SCARLETT:
PORK:
Lordy,
Miss
Scarlett,
SCARLETT:
You
take
it.
It's
for
you.
You
ain't
got
no
business
You
needs
all
your
valuables
Do
you
think
I'd
sell
Pa's
watch?
And
don't
cry.
I
can
stand
everybody's
Oh,
Mammy,
Mammy!
You've
been
brave
so
long.
-Think
about
your
Pa
like
he
used
to
be.
I
can't
think
of
anything
Ain't
no
good
thinking
about
that.
Nobody
but
Yankees
and
Scalawags
Rhett.
MAMMY:
Oh,
Mammy,
I'm
so
thin
and
pale...
...and
I
haven't
any
clothes.
Go
and
get
Ma's
old
box
-What
you
up
to?
Not
with
Miss
Ellen's
portières!
Great
balls
of
fire!
I'm
going
to
Atlanta
for
$300,
-Who's
going
with
you?
That's
what
you
think!
-Mammy,
darling.
I
knows
you
since
I
put
I
said
I's
going
with
you,
RHETT:
Kings
in
trade,
eh?
It's
a
pity
the
war
You'd
done
better
than
Grant,
What
is
it?
There's
a
lady
to
see
Captain
Butler.
Another
sister?
MAJOR:
CORPORAL:
No,
she
ain't
one
of
those.
She
has?
I'd
like
to
see
this
one,
major.
Let's
see,
my
losses
for
Three
hundred
and
forty?
My
debts
do
mount
up,
All
right,
corporal,
show
Captain
Thank
you,
major.
It's
hard
to
be
strict
with
a
man
-Rhett!
My
dear
little
sister!
It's
all
right,
corporal.
My
sister
Can
I
really
kiss
you?
On
the
forehead,
like
a
good
brother.
No,
thanks.
I'll
wait
and
hope
I
was
so
distressed
when
I
couldn't
sleep
for
thinking.
Would
you
be
sorry?
-Oh,
Rhett.
They
trumped
up
a
charge,
They
think
I
made
off
-Well,
did
you?
Let's
not
talk
about
things
How
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
me.
How
you
do
run
on,
Thank
heavens
you're
not
in
rags.
You
look
good
enough
to
eat,
I've
been
doing
very
well.
...I
got
so
bored,
I
thought
You're
heartless,
You've
got
more
charm
I
didn't
come
to
talk
I
was
so
miserable
at
the
thought
I
was
mad
at
you
when
-And
I
still
haven't
forgiven
you.
Well,
I
must
admit
I
might
not
be
When
I
think
of
myself
...not
a
care
in
the
world,
And
not
even
a
human
jail,
Listen
to
me
trying
to
make
jokes...
...when
I
really
want
to
cry.
In
a
minute
I
shall
cry.
Scarlett....
Can
it
be
possible
that--?
Can
what
be
possible,
Rhett?
That
you've
grown
a
woman's
heart?
I
have,
Rhett.
I
know
I
have.
It's
worth
being
in
jail
It's
well
worth
it.
You
can
drop
the
moonlight
Things
have
been
going
well
at
Tara?
-I
went
riding
without
my
gloves--
Why
did
you
lie,
-I
almost
believed
you
cared.
Let's
get
down
to
the
truth.
...to
put
on
quite
a
What
is
it?
Money?
I
want
$300
to
pay
the
taxes
on
Tara.
I
lied
when
I
said
Things
are
as
bad
as
they
possibly
What
collateral
do
you
have?
-My
earbobs.
-Mortgage
on
Tara.
-I'd
pay
you
out
of
next
year's
cotton.
You
once
said
you
loved
me.
If
you
still
love
me....
You
haven't
forgotten,
No,
I
haven't
forgotten.
You're
not
worth
$300.
You'll
never
mean
anything
SCARLETT:
I
don't
care
what
you
say,
I
won't
let
Tara
go!
I
can't
while
Oh,
Rhett,
won't
you
please
I
couldn't
if
I
wanted
to.
My
funds
are
in
Liverpool,
If
I
drew
a
draft,
they'd
be
on
me
So
you
see,
my
dear,
Here,
here.
Stop
it!
You
want
Take
your
hands
off
me,
you
skunk!
You
knew
you
wouldn't
lend
me
I
enjoyed
hearing
Come
to
my
hanging,
I'll
come
to
your
hanging!
I'm
just
afraid
they
won't
hang
you

Where
you
been?

thought
I
keep
myself
occupied.

Get
out
of
the
way
here!
FRANK:
SCARLETT:
Frank
Kennedy!
MAMMY:
FRANK:
I
didn't
know
you
were
here.
Didn't
Suellen
tell
you
Did
she?
I
don't
remember.
-This?
I
don't
suppose
...but
I
can't
help
being
proud
of
it.
-You're
not
making
money?
In
fact,
I'm
mighty
encouraged.
Folks
tell
me
Won't
be
long
before
-Are
you
doing
as
well
as
all
that?
I'm
no
millionaire
yet...
...but
I've
cleared
$1000
already.
SCARLETT:
-That's
only
a
sideline.
With
all
the
good
Georgia
pine
Well,
all
that
takes
money,
...and
I
gotta
think
Why
would
you
want
a
home?
For
Suellen
to
set
up
housekeeping.
Here
in
Atlanta.
You'd
want
to
bring
her
to
Atlanta.
There
wouldn't
be
much
help
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
I
don't
mean
a
thing.
How'd
you
like
to
drive
me
Nothing'd
give
me
more
pleasure.
You
better
stay
to
supper.
Aunt
Pitty'd
be
agreeable,
You
act
on
me
just
like
a
tonic,
And
will
you
tell
me
all
the
news...
...of
Miss
Suellen?
What's
the
matter?
Oh,
no,
no.
I
thought
I
guess
she
was
ashamed
to
write
you.
How
awful
to
have
such
a
mean
sister.
You
must
tell
me.
Don't
leave
me
on
tenterhooks.
Well,
she's
going
to
marry
She
got
tired
of
waiting,
Oh,
I'm
sorry
to
be
It's
cold,
and
I
left
my
muff
at
home.
Would
you
mind
if
I
put
my
hand
But,
Melanie,
you
don't
realize
She's
gone
and
married
He's
my
beau
and
she's
married
him!
-She
did
it
to
save
Tara.
SUELLEN:
I
hate
Scarlett!
She's
It's
all
my
fault.
I
should've
committed
robbery
I
couldn't
let
you
do
Anyway,
it's
done
now.
Yes,
it's
done
now.
You
won't
let
me
do
...yet
you'd
sell
yourself
in
marriage
You
won't
have
to
worry
What
do
you
mean?
ASHLEY:
I've
arranged
But
you
can't
do
that.
I
counted
on
you
to
help
me
start
I
counted
on
you.
I
don't
know
anything
You
know
as
much
as
you
do
...and
I'd
give
you
half
the
business.
That's
generous
of
you,
Scarlett.
But
it
isn't
that.
If
I
go
to
Atlanta
...I'd
bury
any
hope
SCARLETT:
You
could
gradually
buy
the
business,
No,
Scarlett.
Oh!
Ashley!

Ashley!
Scarlett?
Scarlett,
what
is
it?
SCARLETT:
MELANIE:
She
wanted
me
to
go
to
Atlanta.
To
help
me
start
my
lumber
business.
How
unchivalrous
of
you.
Why,
think,
Ashley,
think!
If
it
hadn't
been
for
Scarlett,
...and
maybe
we
wouldn't
have
When
I
think
of
her
picking
cotton
...just
to
keep
food
in
our
mouths,
Oh,
my
darling.
All
right,
Melanie.
I
can't
fight
you
both.
GALLEGHER:
There's
your
new
mill
hands,
The
pick
of
all
the
best
jails
SCARLETT:
They
look
thin
and
weak.
They're
the
best
you
can
lease.
If
you'll
give
Johnnie
Gallegher
...you'll
get
what
you
want
All
right,
you're
the
foreman.
Just
keep
the
mill
running
GALLEGHER:
Johnnie
Gallegher's
...no
questions
and
no
interference.
SCARLETT:
That's
a
bargain.
GALLEGHER:
But
this
isn't
right,
and
you
know
it.
Why
do
you
complain?
You
wouldn't
own
a
mill
But
I
didn't
want
the
mill.
We
couldn't
buy
it
if
you
hadn't
Isn’t
that
right,
Ashley?
Are
you
running
Go
back
to
the
store,
and
go
home
Sugar,
don't
you
think--?
Great
balls
of
fire!
Don't
bother
me.
All
right.
All
right.
My,
my!
She
can
get
mad
quicker
I
don't
like
to
interfere...
...but
I
wish
you'd
let
me
hire
We
could
do
better.
Darkies'
pay
would
break
us.
If
we
give
Gallegher
a
free
hand--
A
free
hand?
That
means
Didn't
you
see
them?
How
you
do
run
on.
If
I
let
you
alone,
...and
tuck
them
in
with
quilts.
I
won't
make
money
out
of

You
didn't
mind
owning
slaves.
That
was
different.
I'd
have
freed
them
...if
the

hadn't
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
Ashley.
Do
you
forget
what
it's
like
Money
is
the
most
I
don't
intend
to
be
without
it
again.
I'll
make
enough
the
only
way
I
know
We're
not
the
only
Southerners
Look
at
all
our
friends.
They're
And
they're
starving.
I've
no
use
I
know
what
they
say
about
me.
I'll
befriend
Carpetbaggers
And
you'll
beat
them
with
me.
SCARLETT:
That's
it.
Pull

-Afternoon,
Mrs.
Kennedy.
-Business
is
certainly
growing.
You're
doing
business

robbed
us,
tortured
us
All
that's
past.
I
intend
to
make
the
best
of
things,
And
do
you
know

It's
shocking
what
she's
doing
She's
even
taken

dear

I
don't
see
how
you
have
You
could've
had
my

Oh,
how
fickle

What
is
it

want?
Will
you
satisfy
my
curiosity
on
a
point
Well,
what
is
it?
Tell
me,
do
you
never
shrink
How'd
you
get
out
of
jail?
Oh,
that!
There's
nothing
much

observe
it's

dangerous
to
drive
alone
Don't
worry
about
me.
I
can

straight,
What
a

Give
me
a

Don't
you

Get
to

as
quick
I
will.
I's
had
enough
Thank
you,
Mr.
Frank.
SCARLETT:
Change
your
dress
and
go
over
I've
got
to
go
How
can
you
go
to
a
political
meeting
Oh,
sugar.
Nobody
cares
about
me.
You
all
act
as
though
The
men
talk
...and
then
after
what
happened
to
me,
And
if
it
won't
pain
you
too
much,

me
why
you're
staring
at
me.
It
won't
pain
me.
What
happened
today
With
any
justice,
MELANIE:
India,
hush
up.
Ever
since
I
took
Charles
away,
If
she
thought
anybody'd
notice,
I
do
hate
you!
You've
done
all
you
could
to
lower
Now
you've
endangered

they've
got
to--
We'd
better
not
say
any
more,
What's
going
on
Shh!

Somebody's
coming
up
the
walk.

Will
you
hand
me
the
pistol,
Whoever
it
is...
...we
know
nothing.
Where
have
they
gone?
Don't
tell
him.
Quickly.
There
may
be
time.
-How'd
you
know?
They
knew
there'd
be
trouble.
Your
men
are
walking
Don't
tell
him.
Out
the
Decatur
road.
They're
meeting
in
the
cellar.
I'll
do

I
can.
What's
this
about?
MELANIE:

men
have
gone
to
clean
out
It's

many
of

Southern
men
And

they're
captured,
they'll

I
meant
no

If

But
beyond
this,
The
great--"
"I
remember
nothing."
Melly,
they're
drunk!
Leave
this
to
me,
Scarlett.
-You
stupid
fool!
CAPTAIN:
Will
you
shut
up,
for
the
love
of--
Hello,
Melly.
So
you've
got
my
husband
I'm
sorry,
If
you
arrest
all
the
drunks
in
Atlanta,
Bring
him
in,
Captain
Butler,
-Wait.
Listen,
doctor,
I--
Put
him
down
in
that
chair.
Now,
captain,
...and
try
to
remember
That's
fine
thanks
I
get
...and
not
leaving
him
DR.
MEADE:
Dr.
Meade!
I'm
astonished
at
you!
MELANIE:
How
can
you
do
this
to
me?
I
ain't
so
very
drunk,
Melly.
Take
him
to
the
bedroom.
-Don't
touch
him.
He's
under
arrest.
What
do
you
want
to
arrest
him
for?
I've
seen
you
drunker.
He
can
lie
in
the
gutter
for
all
I
care.
He
led
a
raid
on
that
Shantytown
A
lot
of
shanties
were
burned.
It's
time
you
rebels
learned
you
can't
What
are
you
laughing
at?
This
isn't
your
night
to
teach
These
two
have
been
With
you,
Rhett?
Where?
I
don't
like
to
say
You'd
better
say.
Come
out
on
the
porch
Speak
out.
I
think
I
have
a
right
Well,
ma'am...
...we
dropped
in
on
a
friend
of
mine...
...and
the
captain's.
A
Mrs.
Belle
Watling.
We
played
cards
Now
you've
done
it.
Did
you
have
Now,
I
hope
you're
satisfied.
These
ladies
won't
be
speaking
CAPTAIN:
Look
here,
will
you
take
an
oath
that
Ask
Belle
if
you
don't
believe
me.
Will
you
give
me
your
word,
As
a
gentleman?
Why,
certainly,
Tom.
Well,
if
I've
made
a
mistake,
I
hope
you'll
forgive
me,
Mrs.
Wilkes.
If
you'll
leave
us
in
peace.
Well,
I
say
I'm
sorry.
Well,
I
am
sorry.
Come
on,
sergeant.
Lock
that
door.
Pull
down
the
shades.
-Oh!
He's
all
right.
Get
him
on
the
bed
I
think
I
can
walk.
It's
not
worth
the
effort.
In
here.
DR.
MEADE:
And
lint
for
bandages.
What
can
I
use
for
a
probe?
Were
you
really
there?
Does
she
have
cut-glass
chandeliers,
Good
heavens,
Mrs.
Meade,
Captain
Butler,
tell
me
what
happened,
I
was
too
late.
When
I
got
to
the
Sullivan
place,
I
found
Mr.
Wilkes
wounded,
I
had
to
prove
they'd
been
somewhere,
-So
I
took
them
to
Belle's.
She's
by
way
of
being
Oh,
I'm
sorry--
I'm
sorry
I
couldn't
think
up
This
isn't
the
first
time
you've
come
It
isn't
likely
that
I'd
question
And
now
I'll
go
and
see
Oh,
Ashley....
Ashley....
Have
you
no
interest
in
what's
Did
Frank
go
with
you
RHETT:
Well,
where
is
he?
He's
lying
out
on
Decatur
Road...
...shot
through
the
head.
He's
dead.
Who
is
it?
It's
Mrs.
Watling.
Oh,
Mrs.
Watling.
Oh,
no,
I
couldn't
do
that,
You
come
in
and
sit
a
minute
with
me.
How
can
I
thank
you
enough
I
got
your
note
saying
you
would
Why,
Mrs.
Wilkes,
I
came
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
to
say
Why,
I'm....
Well,
you're....
It
wouldn't
be
fitting
at
all.
It
wouldn't
be
fitting
for
me
to
thank
Mrs.
Wilkes,
there
ain't
never
been
I
mean,
about
the
money
I
don't
forget
a
kindness.
I
thought
about
you
being
widowed
...if
Mr.
Wilkes
got
hung.
He's
a
nice
little
boy,
I
got
a
boy
myself,
so
I....
You
have?
Does
he
live--?
Oh,
no,
he
ain't
here
in
Atlanta.
He
ain't
never
been
here.
He's
off
at
school.
I
ain't
seen
him
since
he
was
little.
Anyways,
if
it
had
been
that
...I
wouldn't
have
lifted
a
finger,
She's
a
mighty
cold
woman...
...prancing
about
Atlanta
by
herself.
She
killed
her
husband
You
mustn't
say
unkind
things
Oh.
Please
don't
freeze
me,
Mrs.
Wilkes.
I
forgot
how
you
liked
her.
She
just
ain't
in
the
same
class
with
you,
Well,
anyways,
I
gotta
be
going.
I'm
scared
somebody'll
recognize
That
wouldn't
do
you
no
good.
And,
Mrs.
Wilkes,
if
you
ever
see
me
...you
don't
have
to
speak
to
me.
I'll
understand.
I
should
be
proud
to
speak
to
you.
Proud
to
be
under
obligation
to
you.
I
hope
we
meet
again.
Oh,
no.
That
wouldn't
be
fitting.
-Good
night,
Mrs.
Wilkes.
And
you're
wrong
about
Mrs.
Kennedy.
She's
brokenhearted
about
her
husband.

RHETT:
SCARLETT:
It's
Rhett.


MAMMY:
Captain
Butler's
here.
Tell
him
I'll
be
right
down,
Mammy.

She
says
she's
coming.
I
don't
know
why
she's
coming,
You
don't
like
me,
Mammy.
Don't
you
argue
with
me.
It's
no
good,
Scarlett.
-What?
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
I
mean
you've
been
drinking.
Well,
what
if
I
have?
Don't
drink
alone.
People
always
find
out,

What
is
it?
Oh,
Rhett,
I'm
so
afraid.
I
don't
believe
it.
I'm
afraid
now.
I'm
afraid
of
dying
and
going
to
hell.

You
look
pretty
healthy.
Oh,
there
is.
I
know
there
is.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
question
Tell
me
what
you've
done
I
ought
never
to
have
married
Frank.
He
was
Suellen's
beau,
And
I
made
him
miserable,
Yes,
I
did.
I
killed
him.
Rhett,
for
the
first
time...
...I'm
finding
out
what
it
is
Here.
Dry
your
eyes.
If
you
had
it
all
to
do
over
again,
You're
like
the
thief
...but
he's
terribly
sorry
I'm
glad
Mother's
dead.
I'm
glad
she's
dead
I
always
wanted
to
be
like
her,
...and
sadly,
I've
turned
out
You
know,
Scarlett,
I
think
So
I'll
change
the
subject
Say
it,
then,
and
get
out!
-What
is
it?
Oh!
You
really
are
the
most
ill-bred
man
I
made
up
my
mind
you
were
...the
first
day
I
saw
you.
Now
you
have
a
mill
...and
won't
come
to
me
-So
I
see
I
shall
have
to
marry
you.
Would
you
be
convinced
Turn
me
loose
and
get
out.
Forgive
me
for
startling
you
...my
dear
Scarlett--
But
you
must
have
noticed
...the
friendship
I've
felt
for
you
A
feeling
more
beautiful,
Dare
I
name
it?
Can
it
be
love?
Get
up
off
your
knees.
This
is
an
honorable
proposal
...made
at
what
I
consider
I
can't
go
all
my
life
waiting
You're
coarse
and
you're
conceited.
And
I
think
this
conversation's
Besides,
I
shall
never
marry
again.
Oh,
yes,
you
will.
You?
You?
I
don't
love
you.
And
I
don't
like
being
married.
Ever
think
of
marrying
Marriage,
fun?
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Do
you
want
them
to
hear
you?
You've
been
married
Why
not
try
a
husband
of
the
right
age,
You're
a
fool,
Rhett
Butler...
...when
you
know
I
shall
always
love
Stop
it.
You
hear
me?
Stop
it.
No
more
of
that
talk.
Don't.
I
shall
faint.
I
want
you
to
faint.
None
of
those
fools
Your
Charles
or
your
Frank
Say
you're
going
to
marry
me.
Yes.
Are
you
sure
you
meant
it?
No.
Look
at
me,
Did
you
say
yes
because
of
my
money?
Well,
yes,
partly.
Partly?
Well,
you
know,
Rhett,
-And,
of
course,
I
am
fond
of
you.
If
I
said
I
was
madly
in
love
-You
say
we
have
a
lot
in
common--
I'm
not
in
love
Heaven
help
the
man
What
kind
of
ring
would
you
like?
A
diamond
ring,
You'll
have
the
biggest
I'll
take
you
to
New
Orleans
-That'd
be
heavenly.
How
wonderful...
...but
you
won't
tell
anybody,
Still
the
little
hypocrite.
Won't
you
kiss
me
goodbye?
You've
had
enough
kissing
You're
impossible.
You
can
go.
But
I
will
come
back.
What
are
you
thinking
about,
Scarlett?
I'm
thinking
about
how
rich
we
are.
I
can
keep
the
lumber
business
too?
Yes,
of
course
you
can,
Now
that
you're
so
rich,
you
can
tell
But
you
were
the
main
one

Don't
scrape
the
plate.

Oh,
Rhett,
can
I
have
If
you
don't
stop
being
a
glutton,
And
I'll
divorce
you.
RHETT:
It'd
be
nice
if
you
bought
Why
should
I
buy
her
a
present
Mules?
Why
mules?
She
said
we
could
give
ourselves
air
...but
we
were
just
mules
in
horse
I
never
heard
anything
more
true.
And
one
of
the
few
people
I
know
-I
won't
give
her
a
thing.
My
mammy
said
...she
wanted
a
red
taffeta
petticoat
...and
so
rustley
the
Lord
would
say
She
won't
take
it
from
you.
That
may
be.
But
I'm
making

RHETT:
You
were
having
another
nightmare.
Oh,
Rhett.
Rhett,
I
was
so
cold
I
couldn't
find
it.
I
ran
through
-Find
what,
honey?
I
always
dream
the
same
dream,
It
seems
to
be
hidden
in
the
mist.
Darling....
Oh,
Rhett,
do
you
think
I'll
ever
dream
Dreams
don't
work
that
way.
But
when
you
get
used
...you'll
stop
dreaming
that
dream.
And,
Scarlett,
I'm
going
to
see
Rhett,
would
you
do
something
for
me
You
know
I
would.
Will
you
take
me
away
from
here?
-Don't
you
like
New
Orleans?
...but
I
want
to
go
home
Will
you
take
me
to
Tara?
Yes,
Scarlett.
Of
course
I
will.
We'll
go
tomorrow.
You
get
your
strength
You're
part
of
it
I'd
give
anything
to
have
Tara
Would
you?
Go
ahead
and
make
it
that
way.
Make
it
as
fine
a
plantation
Oh,
Rhett!
Rhett,
you
are
good
to
me.
Can
we
still
have
our
big
new
house
Yes.
And
it
can
be
Marble
terraces,
Won't
everyone
be
jealous!
I
want
everybody
who's
been
mean
I
don't
care.
Scarlett's
hateful...
...building
that
new
house
And
even
taking
our
servants!
Oh,
darling,
you
mustn't
think
She's
made
it
possible
for
us
Yes,
and
what
good
is
Tara?
She's
had
three
husbands,
PORK:
Great
Jehoshaphat!
Lordy,
we
sure
is
rich
now.
RHETT:
That's
ridiculous!
I'm
entitled
to
at
least
see
You
control
yourself.
I'd
like
to
apologize
Oh,
hush
your
mouth.
Boys
aren't
any
use.
Have
a
drink
of
sherry.
Mammy,
she
is
beautiful,
isn't
she?
She
sure
is.
You
ever
see
a
prettier
one?
Miss
Scarlett
was
mighty
near
that
Have
another
glass.

Mammy?
What's
that
rustling
noise
I
hear?
Lordy,
that
ain't
nothing
but
my
Nothing
but
your
petticoat?
Mr.
Rhett,
you
is
bad.
Yea,
Lordy!
You
sure
took
a
long
enough
time
Yes,
sir.
Too
long.
No
more
mule
in
horse's
harness?
Mister
Rhett,
Miss
Scarlett
You
ain't
holding
that
I
don't
hold
it
against
you.
I
just
wanted
to
know.
Here,
take
the
whole
bottle.
Dr.
Meade
says
you
can
go
in
now,
This
sure
is
a
happy
day
to
me.
I
done
diapered
three
generations
And
it
sure
is
a
happy
day.
Oh,
yes,
Mammy.
The
happiest
days
Oh,
Mammy,
she's
beautiful.
Miss
Scarlett
done
told
me
...she
was
going
to
name
it
RHETT:
The
most
beautiful
baby
ever.
Yes....

Do
you
know
that
this
is
That
you're
a
week
old
today?
Yes,
I'm
going
to
buy
her
a
pony,
...this
town
has
never
seen.
Yes,
I'm
going
to
send
her
to
Yes,
and
her
will
be
received
by
And
when
it
comes
time
...well,
she'll
be
a
little
princess.
Certainly
making
a
fool
of
yourself.
Why
shouldn't
I?
She's
the
first
person
who's
ever
Great
balls
of
fire!
I
had
the
baby,
didn't
I?
MELANIE:
It's
Melanie.
May
I
come
in?
Yes,
come
in
and
look
at
Most
babies
have
blue
eyes
Don't
tell
him
anything.
Nevertheless,
her
eyes
are
blue
As
blue
as
the
Bonnie
Blue
flag.
That's
it.
"Bonnie
Blue
Butler."
Try
again,
Mammy.
Twenty
inches.
Twenty
inches.
You
simply
gotta
make
it
18
1/2
again.
You
done
had
a
baby.
And
you
ain't
never
gonna
be
There
ain't
nothing
to
do
about
it.
There
is
something
to
do
about
it.
I'm
just
not
going
to
get
old
and
fat
I
just
won't
have
any
more
babies.
I
heard
Mr.
Rhett
say
Tell
Captain
Butler
I
decided
I'll
have
supper
in
my
room.
I
got
your
message.
I'll
have
them
bring
No
objections
to
that,
I
hope?
No.
Yes.
Uh....
I
mean,
I
don't
care
Rhett....
RHETT:
Yes?
Well,
I've
decided....
Well,
I
hope
I
don't
have
My
pet,
as
I
told
you
...it's
immaterial
to
me
No,
but
you
know
what
I....
Do
you
know
what
I
mean?
I
do.
And
do
you
know
You're
low
enough
to
think
of
that.
If
you
had
any
chivalry
in
you,
Look
at
Ashley
Wilkes.
Melanie
can't
You've
been
to
the
lumber
office
What
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?
Quite
the
little
gentleman,
Ashley.
It's
no
use.
You
wouldn't
understand.
-You
know,
I'm
sorry
for
you,
Scarlett.
Yes,
sorry
for
you
because
you
throw
...and
reach
out
for
something
I
don't
know
If
you
were
free
and
Melly
were
dead
...do
you
think
you'd
be
happy?
You'd
never
know
him,
...any
more
than
you
understand
Never
mind
about
that.
I
want--
You
may
keep
your
sanctity.
You
don't
care?
The
world
is
full
...and
I
shan't
be
lonely.
Well,
that's
fine.
But
I
warn
you,
in
case
you
change
Why
bother?
If
I
wanted
to
come
in,
I
knew
most
women
were
cheats...
...hypocritical
and
hard,
-It
ain't
no
use.
I
mean
you're
poisoned
with
her.
I
don't
care
what
she's
done
to
you.
-It
pleasures
me
none
to
say
it.
You've
gotta
think
of
the
child.
You're
a
shrewd
woman,
Belle.
And
a
very
nice
one.
Yes,
Rhett?
I
was
just
thinking
of
the
difference
You're
both
hardheaded
businesswomen,
But
you've
got
a
heart,
Belle.
And
you're
honest.
Goodbye,
Rhett.
Goodbye,
Belle.
RHETT:
Look
at
those
hands.
And
that
seat!
SCARLETT:
Why
we
have
to
wheel
a
baby
-Good
morning,
Mrs.
Merriwether.
Good
morning,
Scarlett.
Making
fools
of
ourselves
If
you'd
thought
of
your
position,
But
as
it
is,
we're
going
to
cultivate
-Good
morning,
Mrs.
Whiting.
Good
morning,
Scarlett.
So
the
millionaire
speculator
Money
can't
buy
I'll
admit
I've
been
at
fault
too.
Bonnie
will
have
a
place
Even
if
we
both
have
to
crawl
Good
morning,
Mrs.
Meade.
MRS.
MEADE:
Good
morning,
Captain
RHETT:
Mrs.
Merriwether,
I
have
-Could
you
give
me
some
advice?
My
Bonnie
sucks
her
thumb.
You
should
make
her
stop!
I
know,
I
know.
-I
tried
putting
soap
on
her
nails.
Put
quinine
on
her
thumb
and
Quinine!
I
never
would
have
I
can't
thank
you
enough.
You've
taken
a
great
load
off
my
mind.
Good
morning.
Good
morning,
Dolly.
Good
morning,
Caroline.
...there's
a
great
deal
of
good
in
But
of
course
there
is.
Fanny
Elsing
told
Dr.
Meade
that
...that
he
was
honored
for
his
No,
and
did
I
tell
you
...a
stupendous
contribution
to
the
-...of
the
Graves
of
the
Glorious
Dead?
My
grandbaby,
Napoleon
Picard,
Why,
Dolly
Merriwether,
it
was
Why,
Caroline
Meade,

RHETT:
Watch
Daddy
put
your
pony
Daddy,
let
me!
Let
me!
All
right,
darling.
Put
her
on,
Pork.
Up
we
go!
Oh,
there!
Lordy
mercy!
RHETT:
Grip
tightly
with
your
legs.
Hold
your
reins
properly
That
was
fine.
I
knew
you'd
do
it.
When
you're
older,
You'll
be
the
best
horsewoman
MAMMY:
Mr.
Rhett!
Did
you
see
her?
Mr.
Rhett,
I
done
told
you
...it
just
ain't
fittin'
for
a
girl
to
ride
All
right.
I'll
teach
her
And
I'll
buy
her
a
blue
velvet
A
nice
black
broadcloth
Oh,
now,
Mammy,
Well,
I
don't
think
it's
fittin',
but....
It
ain't
fittin',
it
just
ain't
fittin'.
It
ain't
fittin'.
ASHLEY:
Why,
Scarlett,
what
are
you
Well,
Ashley,
I
just--
Why
aren't
you
helping
Melly
Why,
Ashley
Wilkes,
you
aren't
Melly'd
be
so
disappointed
I
won't
let
on.
I'll
be
the
most
surprised
man
As
long
as
you're
here,
...so
you
can
see
how
bad
Don't
let's
fool
with
any
books
today.
...all
the
figures
I
ever
knew
Figures
are
well
lost
when
Scarlett,
you
know,
You
haven't
changed
a
bit
since
...where
you
sat
under
a
tree
That
girl
doesn't
exist
anymore.
Nothing's
turned
out
as
I
expected,
Yes,
we've
traveled
a
long
road
Oh,
the
lazy
days...
...the
warm,
still,
...the
high,
soft
Negro
laughter
...the
golden
warmth
and
security
Don't
look
back,
Ashley.
Don't
look
back.
It
drags
at
your
heart
till...
...you
can't
do
anything
I
didn't
mean
to
make
you
sad,
I
never
want
you
to
be
anything
Oh,
Ashley!

-Who
is
it?
Come
in.
Am
I
actually
being
invited
You're
not
ready
for
Melanie's
party.
I've
got
a
headache,
Rhett.
You
go
without
me
What
a
white-livered
Get
up!
You're
going
to
that
party
-Has
India
dared--?
-Everyone
in
town
knows
the
story.
I
don't
kill
people
who
tell
the
truth.
No
time
to
argue.
I
won't
go!
I
can't
go
until
You
won't
cheat
Melly
out
of
publicly
There
was
nothing
wrong.
If
you
don't
show
your
face
tonight,
I
don't
care,
but
you
won't
ruin
You're
going
to
that
party,
Wear
that.
Nothing
modest
And
put
on
plenty
of
rouge.
GUESTS

For
he's
a
jolly
good
fellow

-Good
night,
Scarlett.
You're
going
into
the
arena
alone.
Don't
leave
me.
Don't.
You're
not
afraid?

MELANIE:
India
wasn't
able
to
come.
I
do
need
you
to
help
me
Mrs.
Meade...
...here's
our
darling
Scarlett.
-Good
evening.
-Why,
Scarlett.
Ashley,
aren't
you
going
to
get

MAMMY:
Did
you
have
a
good
time
Yes.
Now,
Mammy,
If
Captain
Butler
asks
for
me
Yes'm.
RHETT:
Come
here.
Sit
down.
No
reason
you
shouldn't
I
didn't
want
a
drink.
You
heard
nothing
of
the
kind.
You
wouldn't
have
come
-You
must
need
a
drink
badly.
Take
it.
Don't
give
yourself
airs.
I
know
you
drink
on
the
quiet,
Do
you
think
I
care
-You're
drunk
and
I'm
going
to
bed.
...and
I
intend
getting
still
drunker
But
you're
not
going
to
bed.
Not
yet.
Sit
down.
So
she
stood
by
you,
did
she?
How's
it
feel
to
have
the
woman
You're
wondering
if
she
knows
You're
wondering
if
she
did
it
You're
thinking
she's
a
fool
for
doing
it,
-I
will
not
listen.
Miss
Melly's
a
fool,
She
has
too
much
honor
to
conceive
And
she
loves
you.
Though
just
why
she
does,
If
you
weren't
so
drunk
and
insulting,
-As
it
is,
though--
Of
course,
the
comic
figure
in
all
this
Mr.
Wilkes,
who
can't
be
...and
won't
be
unfaithful
to
her
-Why
doesn't
he
make
up
his
mind?
Observe
my
hands,
my
dear.
I
could
tear
you
to
pieces
with
them.
And
I'd
do
it
if
it'd
take
But
it
wouldn't.
So
I'll
remove
him
I'll
put
my
hands
so.
One
on
each
side
of
your
head.
And
I'll
smash
your
skull
And
that'll
block
him
out.
Take
your
hands
off
me,
You
know,
I've
always
admired
Never
more
than
now,
I'm
not
cornered.
You'll
never
corner
me
or
frighten
me.
You've
lived
in
dirt
so
long,
You're
jealous
of
something
Good
night.
RHETT:
Yes,
I
suppose
I
am.
Even
though
I
know
you've
been
How
do
I
know?
Because
I
know
Ashley
Wilkes
They're
gentlemen.
That's
more
than
I
can
say
We're
not
gentlemen.
It's
not
that
easy,
Scarlett.
You
turn
me
out
while
you
chase
Ashley,
This
is
one
night

How
are
you
feeling
this
morning?
Well,
this
misery
in
my
back...
...ain't
so
good.

You
act
mighty
happy
this
morning.
I
am,
Mammy.
I
am.

Oh,
she
wept
with
delight
And
trembled
with
fear
at
his
frown
RHETT:
I,
um....
I'd
like
to
extend
my
apology
Oh,
but,
Rhett.
I
was
very
drunk...
...and
quite
swept
off
my
feet
You
needn't
bother
to
apologize.
I've
been
thinking,
and
I
believe
...if
we
admitted
we
made
a
mistake
-A
divorce?
There's
no
point
in
holding
on
I'll
provide
for
you.
Just
give
me
Bonnie,
Thank
you,
but
I
wouldn't
dream
of
You'd
disgrace
it
Makes
my
head
spin
to
think
Wouldn't
you?
Answer
me.
Wouldn't
you?
Please
go
now
and
leave
me
alone.
I'm
going.
That's
what
I
came
I'm
going
on
a
very
extended
trip
-And
I'm
leaving
today.
I'm
taking
Bonnie
with
me.
You'll
never
take
my
child
She's
my
child
too.
You're
mistaken
...with
a
mother
who
doesn't
You're
a
fine
one
to
talk.
You
think
I'll
let
her
out
when
you'll
If
you
were
a
man,
I'll
thank
you
to
shut
your
mouth.
As
for
you
giving
yourself
airs
...a
cat's
a
better
mother
Have
her
things
packed
for
me
...I've
always
thought
a
lashing
with
Excuse
me,
Mr.
Rhett.
-Hello,
Uncle
Rhett.
Daddy,
where
have
you
been?
I've
been
hunting
for
a
rabbit
skin
Give
your
best
sweetheart
a
kiss.
Bonnie,
I'm
going
to
take
you
Where?
Where?
I'll
show
you
the
Tower
of
London,
...and
London
Bridge.
London
Bridge?
Well,
it
will
BONNIE
:
Dark!
RHETT:
It's
all
right,
Bonnie.
BONNIE:
Daddy,
dark!
What's
the
matter
with
my
Bonnie?
BONNIE:
Oh,
a
bear?
A
big
bear?
BONNIE:
And
he
sat
on
my
chest!
I'll
stay
here
and
shoot
him
NURSE:
I
told
you
never
to
leave
Children
are
often
afraid
of
the
dark,
Let
her
scream
for
a
night--
Let
her
scream?
Either
you're
a
fool
If
you
want
her
to
grow
up
cowardly--
Cowardly?
There
isn't
You're
discharged.
As
you
say,
sir.
Where's
Mother?
Bonnie....
Aren't
you
happy
here
I
wanna
go
home.
Miss
Bonnie!
And
Captain
Butler!
BONNIE:
MAMMY:
Miss
Scarlett,
they's
back.
Bonnie!
Bonnie,
baby.
Darling
baby!
Daddy
gave
me
a
kitten.
But
London's
a
horrid
place.
Where's
my
pony?
You
go
out
and
see
your
pony.
BONNIE:
I
want
to
go
out
and
see
my
pony.
You
run
along
with
Mammy.
Come
on,
honey
child.
Mrs.
Butler,
I
believe.
Mammy
said
you'd
come
back.
Only
to
bring
Bonnie.
Apparently
any
mother,
You
mean
you're
going
away
again?
What
perception,
Mrs.
Butler.
-In
fact,
I
left
my
bags
at
the
station.
You're
looking
pale.
Or
can
this
wanness
mean
If
I'm
pale,
it's
your
fault.
Not
because
I've
been
Pray
continue,
Mrs.
Butler.
It's
because
I'm
going
to
have
a
baby.
Indeed.
And
who's
the
happy
father?
You
know
it's
yours.
No
woman
would
want
the
child
I
wish
it
were
anybody's
Well,
cheer
up.

Is
she
better?
Has
she
asked
for
me?
Don't
you
understand?
Rhett....
I
want
Rhett!
MAMMY:
What's
the
matter,
honey?
It's
no
use.
It's
no
use!

Dr.
Meade's
left.
-Scarlett's
dead.
Really
she
is.
There,
there,
Captain
Butler,
She'll
very
soon
be
well
again.
She
never
wanted
this
baby.
Not
want
a
baby?
You
do,
but
she
doesn't.
She
told
me
she
didn't
want
any
more.
I
wanted
to
hurt
her
because
You
mustn't
tell
me
these
things.
I
didn't
know
about
this
baby
If
I'd
only
known,
Well,
of
course
you
would.
And
then
when
she
told
me
What
did
I
say?
But
you
didn't
mean
it.
But
I
did
mean
it.
She's
never
cared
for
me.
I
tried
You're
so
wrong.
Scarlett
loves
you
a
great
deal.
If
that
were
true,
I'd
wait
forever.
She
will.
You
must
be
patient.
No,
it's
not
possible.
If
you
You
wouldn't
believe
it.
Surely
you
haven't
No,
Captain
Butler.
There,
there.
Scarlett's
going
to
get
well,
She
couldn't
even
if
she
wanted
to.
But
of
course
she
could!
No,
Miss
Melly,
you
mustn't
risk
it.
Children
are
life
renewing
itself,
And
when
life
does
that,
I've
never
before
known
anyone
I
pray
God
things
go
well
And
I
want
to
thank
you
for
all
From
my
heart,
I
thank
you.
Miss
Scarlett's
feeling
Thank
you,
Mammy.
I've
come
to
ask
your
forgiveness...
...hoping
our
life
together
Our
life
together?
When
did
we
Yes,
you're
right.
But
I'm
sure
if
we
could
only
What
is
there
Well,
there's
Bonnie...
...and
I
love
you,
Scarlett.
When
did
you
discover
that?
I've
always
loved
you,
but
you've
And
just
what
do
you
want
me
to
do?
To
begin
with,
give
up
the
mill,
We'll
take
Bonnie
Give
up
the
mill?
I
know,
but
we
don't
need
it.
Or
give
it
to
Ashley.
Melanie!
I
am
thinking
of
you.
And
I'm
thinking
that,
well...
...maybe
the
mill's
taking
you
I
know
what
you're
thinking.
-You're
taking
her
away
from
me.
You've
made
her
love
you
and
not
me.
Mommy,
Daddy!
Watch
me.
SCARLETT:
You're
mighty
pretty,
precious.
So
are
you.
I'm
going
to
jump.
I
don't
think
you
ought
You
just
learned
I
will
so
jump.
I
can
jump
better
than
ever,
I
moved
the
bar
higher.
Don't
let
her
do
it,
Rhett.
No,
Bonnie,
you
can't.
If
you
fall
off,
Rhett,
stop
her.
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
She's
just
like
Pa.
Just
like
Pa...!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!

Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Lordy,
Miss
Melly.
Oh,
Mammy,
this
house
won't
seem
How's
Miss
Scarlett
bearing
up?
Miss
Melly,
this
here's
I
didn't
fetch
you
What
that
child
got
to
stand,
the
good
It's
Mr.
Rhett
I's
worried
about.
He
done
lost
his
mind
Oh,
no,
Mammy,
no.
I
ain't
never
seen
no
man,
black
or
white,
When
Dr.
Meade
say
her
neck
broke...
...Mr.
Rhett
grabbed
his
gun
and
run
And
for
a
minute,
Oh,
poor
Captain
Butler.
Miss
Scarlett
called
him
a
murderer
She
said,
"You
give
me
my
baby
And
then
he
say
Miss
Scarlett
ain't
It
like
to
turn
my
blood
cold,
Stop,
Mammy,
don't
tell
me
any
more.
And
then
that
night...
...Mr.
Rhett,
he
locked
hisself
He
wouldn't
open
the
door
when
And
that's
where
he's
been
Oh,
Mammy!
This
evening,
Miss
Scarlett
shouted
"The
funeral's
set
for
tomorrow."
He
says,
"You
try
that,
Do
you
think
I's
gonna
put
my
child
Oh,
Mammy,
Mammy!
-He
has
lost
his
mind!
He
ain't
gonna
let
us
bury
Oh,
but
I
can't
intrude.
If
you
can't
help
us,
who
can?
Mr.
Rhett
always
set
great
store
Please,
Miss
Melly.
I'll
do
what
I
can,
Mammy.
RHETT:
Get
away
from
that
door
MELANIE:
Please
let
me
in.
Oh,
Lord,
please
help
Mr.
Rhett
Mammy....
I
want
you
to
make
a
good
deal
...and
bring
it
up
to
Captain
Butler.
But....
Captain
Butler's
willing
for
the
funeral
Hallelujah!
I
expect
the
angels
Miss
Melly!
Miss
Melly!
Miss
Melly!
Miss
Melly.
Miss
Melly.
Send

Dr.
Meade,
Mammy.
Try
to
get
me
home.
Miss
Melly!
Miss
Melly!

BEAU:
And
why
can't
I
go
along,
please?
We
can't
always
go
along,
Beau,
You're
going
back
to
bed
now.
Oh,
Rhett,
she
can't
be
dying.
She
hasn't
your
strength.
-She's
never
had
anything
but
heart.
Why
do
I
have
to
go
back
to
bed?
It
isn't
really
morning
yet.
You
may
come
in
now,
Scarlett.
Dr.
Meade,
please
let
me
see
her.
I've
got
to
tell
her
She
knows
you
were
wrong.
Miss
Melly's
going
to
die
in
peace.
...telling
her
things
that
make
It's
me,
Melly.
Promise
me?
Anything.
Look
after
my
little
son.
I
gave
him
to
you
once
before.
The
day
he
was
born.
Please,
Melly,
don't
talk
this
way.
Promise
me...college.
Yes,
and
Europe,
and
a
pony.
...oh,
Melly,
do
try.
Ashley....
Ashley
and
you....
What
about
Ashley,
Melly?
Look
after
him
for
me...
...just
as
you
looked
after
me...
...for
him.
I
will,
Melly.
Look
after
him...
...but
never
let
him
know.
Good
night.
Promise?
What
else,
Melly?
Captain
Butler.
-Be
kind
to
him.
He
loves
you
so.
Yes,
Melly.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You
ladies
may
come
in
now.
Rhett....
Ashley!
I
don't
know
where
She
must've
put
it
away.
Stop
it!
Hold
me.
I'm
so
frightened!
I'm
so
frightened!
Scarlett,
what
can
I
do?
Everything
I
ever
had
Oh,
Ashley....
You
really
love
her,
don't
you?
She's
the
only
dream
I
ever
had
Dreams.
Always
dreams
with
you.
Scarlett,
if
you
knew
what
Ashley,
you
should've
told
me
years
And
not
left
me
dangling
But
you
had
to
wait
till
now,
...to
show
me
that
I
could
never
...than
this
Watling
woman
And
I've
loved
something
But
somehow...
...I
don't
care.
Somehow,
it
doesn't
matter.
It
doesn't
matter
one
bit.
Oh,
Ashley....
Ashley,
forgive
me.
Don't
cry.
She
mustn't
see
Ashley!
ASHLEY:
Melly!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett,
where
are
you?
Rhett,
wait
for
me!
Rhett,
wait
for
me!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Come
in.
Rhett....
Melanie,
she's...?
Well,
God
rest
her.
She
was
the
only
completely
A
great
lady.
A
very
great
lady.
So
she's
dead.
That
makes
it
How
can
you
say
such
a
thing?
No,
I
don't
know
that
I
do.
It's
to
your
credit
that
Of
course
I
appreciated
her.
-Why,
her
last
words
were
about
you.
She
said,
"Be
kind
to
Captain
Butler...
...he
loves
you
so."
RHETT:
Did
she
say
anything
else?
She
asked
me
to
look
after
Ashley
too.
It's
convenient
to
have
What
do
you
mean?
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
leaving
you,
my
dear.
All
you
need
now
is
a
divorce,
Oh,
no!
No,
you're
wrong.
Terribly
wrong.
I
don't
want
a
divorce.
Oh,
Rhett,
when
I
knew
tonight,
...I
ran
home
to
tell
you.
Please
don't
go
on
with
this.
Leave
us
some
dignity
out
This
last?
Do
listen
to
me!
I
must
...I
was
such
a
fool,
Please
believe
me.
You
must
care.
I
believe
you.
I
never
really
loved
Ashley.
You
certainly
gave
a
good
imitation
No,
Scarlett.
I've
tried
everything.
If
you'd
met
me
halfway,
even
I
was
so
glad
to
see
you.
Then
when
you
were
sick,
I
hoped
that
you'd
call
for
me.
I
wanted
you.
I
wanted
you
...but
I
didn't
think
you
wanted
me.
It
seems
we've
been
But
it's
no
use
now.
As
long
as
there
was
Bonnie,
I
liked
to
think
that
Bonnie
Before
the
war
and
poverty
She
was
so
like
you.
And
I
could
pet
her
and
spoil
her,
But
when
she
went,
she
took
everything.
Rhett,
please
don't
say
that.
I'm
so
sorry
for
everything.
My
darling,
you're
such
a
child.
You
think
that
by
saying,
"I'm
sorry,"
Here,
take
my
handkerchief.
Never,
in
any
crisis
of
your
life,
have
Rhett!
Rhett,
where
are
you
going?
I'm
going
to
Charleston,
Please.
Please
take
me
with
you.
No.
I'm
through
I
want
peace.
...there
isn't
something
left
-You
know
what
I'm
talking
about?
-I
only
know
that
I
love
you!
Oh,
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
If
you
go,
where
shall
I
go?
Frankly,
my
dear,
I
can't
let
him
go.
I
can't!
There
must
be
some
way
Oh,
I
can't
think
about
this
now.
I'll
think
about
it
tomorrow.
But
I
must
think
about
it!
I
must
think
about
it.
What
is
there
to
do?
What
is
there
that
matters?
GERALD:
You
mean
to
tell
me,
Land's
the
only
thing
that
matters.
ASHLEY:
Something
you
love
more
than
RHETT:
It's
this
from
which
you
get
GERALD:
Land's

only
thing
that
matters.
ASHLEY:
Something
you
love
more
RHETT:
--from
which
you
get
GERALD:
ASHLEY:
RHETT:
--the
red
earth
of
Tara.
ASHLEY:
Tara!
Tara!
Home.
I'll
go
home.
And
I'll
think
of
some
way
After
all,
tomorrow
is
another
day!
