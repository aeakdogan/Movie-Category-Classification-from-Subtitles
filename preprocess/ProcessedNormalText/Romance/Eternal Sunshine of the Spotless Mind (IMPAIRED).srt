You're
kinda
closed-mouthed,

It's
just,
you
know,
I
go
to
work,
I
come
home.
Don't
know
what
to
say.
You
should
read
my
journal.

it's
just...
blank.
Really?
Does

you.
I
know
it.
Um...

Joel,
you
should
come
up
It

picnic.
A
night
picnic.

we
could...
Sounds
good.
But
I...
I
should,
uh,
go.
You
should
stay.
No,
I
really...
I'm...
I...
I
have
to
get
up
so
early.
I
would

No.
Mm-mmm.
Look,
our
files
are
confidential,
so
I
can't

it
a
rest!
It's
okay.
Carrie,
I
am
making
What
can
I
say,
Joel?
She's
impulsive.
She
decided
to
erase
you

A
lark.

Why?
Why?

I'm
sorry,
Doctor.
Okay.
I
want
it
done.
I
told
him
-
Oh,
th-th-that's...
that's
okay,
Mary.
Mr.
Barish,
if
you'd
like
to,
uh...
And,
Mary,
if
you
could
take
care
of
Mrs.
Now,
the,
uh...
the
first
thing
is
to
go
home...
and
collect
everything
you
own
Anything.
And
we'll
use
these
items
to
create
Okay?
So
we'll
need,
uh,
books
she
may
have
bought
you,
journal
entries.
We
want
to
empty
your
home...
We
want
to
empty
your
life
And
after
the
mapping
is
done,
our
technicians
That
way,
when
you
awake
you'll
fixind
yourself
in
your
own
bed
a
new
life
awaiting
you.

Wake
up,
buddy!

You
can't
have
the
procedure
done
Well,
it's
just
not
our
policy...
Hello.
I'm
right
here.
I
know
it's
an
emergency,
and
we'll
do
everything
Maybe
you
could
talk
to
the
doctor,
All
right,
so
let's
make
an
appointment.
Mr.
Barish.
Um,
he's
Maybe
tomorrow
would
be
better.
February
is
very
busy
for
us



This
is,

of
our
most
experienced

He'll

Very

couple
years
ago,

my
friends
Rob
and
Carrie
invited
us
to
Naomi
couldn't
go,
but
I
went...
and
I,
uh,
met
Clementine.

Let's
start
with
and
work
backwards
from
there,
There's
an
emotional
core...
to
each
of
our
memories,
and
when
you
eradicate
that
core
By
the
time
you
wake
up
all
the
memories
we've
targeted
as
in
a
dream
upon
waking.
Is
there
any
risk
Well,
uh,
technically
speaking,
the
procedure
is
brain
damage,
but
it's
on
a
par
with
Nothing
you'll
miss.
Comfortable?
What
we're
doing
here,
Mr.
Barish,

If
we
want
to
get
this
procedure
I
want
you
to
react
to
these

There's
a
good
story
Uh,
actually,
Mr.
Barish,
I'll
get
if
you
refrain
from
any
sort
of

I
should
invite
my
girlfriend
over.
Do
whatever
you
want.

tell
you
We
gotta
focus
here,
Yeah,
the
thing
is,

matched
my
sweatshirt
exactly.
I
like
it.
You
look
like
a
tangerine.
"Clemen-teen"
the
tangerine.
And
seedless.
I
like
tangerines!
Can
you
see
me
doing
ducks?
Tangerine.
Joel.
Ducks.
Quack-quack.
How

And
adults

Howard
just
makes
it
all
go
away.
Oh,
my
God.
Baby,

going
on?
I
I'm
lost,
I'm
scared,
I
feel
like
I'm
disappearing.
Disappearing?
My
skin's
Nothing
makes
any
sense
to
me!
Nothing
makes
any
sense.
Nothing
Nothing
makes
any
sense.
Nothing
makes
any
sense,
Patrick.
Hey,
let's
go
out
dancing.
Yeah?
Montauk?
No!
Come
up
to
Boston
with
me.
No,
no.
Now.
Now.
I
have
to
see


Um,

a
message
after
the
beep


W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold
on,

Hello?
Yeah,
what's
up?
I
got
into
a
little
situation
Can
you
handle
things
tonight
alone?
Don't
worry
about
it.
I
got
it
under
He's
pretty
much
on
autopilot
right
now
Dude,
I
gotta
go.

Come

Charles.
"Look!
You

Charles
River.
I'm
just

I've

felt
that
I'm
so
excited.
Yea.
Cool.
I
got
you

What?
Happy
early
Valentine's

I've
never
gone
out
with
a
guy
Thank
you.
Let's
go.
Joely?
Am
I
ugly?
Mm-mmm.
When
I
was
a

Sometimes
I
think
people
don't
Like
you
don't
matter.
So,
I'm
eight...
and
I
have
these
toys,
these
dolls.
My
favorite
is
this
ugly
girl
doll
And
I
keep
yelling
at
her:
"You
can't
be
ugly!
Be
pretty!"
It's
weird.
Like
if
I
can
transform
her,
I
would
magically
change
too.
You're
pretty.
Joely,
don't
ever
leave
me.
Pretty.
Pretty.

Mierzwiak,
Just

one.

I
don't
wanna
Whoo!


I
could
die
right
now,
Clem.
I'm
just...
happy.
I've
never
felt
that
before.
Mmm.
I'm
just
exactly...
where
I
wanna
be.
Clem?
