Now,
Ross,
repeat
after
me.
"I,
Ross."
I,
Ross.
"Take
thee,
Emily."
Take
thee,
Rachel.
Shall
I
go
on?
He
said,
"Rachel,"
right?
Do
you
think
I
should
go
up
there?
Yes.
Yes.
Do
go
on.

I
think
we'd
better
start
again.
Repeat
after
me.
"I,
Ross."
I,
Ross.
"Take
thee,
Emily."
Take
thee,
Emily.
Like
there'd
be
anybody
else.
"As
my
lawfully
wedded
wife,
...till
death

As

parts
us.
Really,
I
do.
Emily.
Do
you
have
the
rings?
Place
this
ring
on
Ross'
finger...
...as
a
symbol
of
Ross,
place
this
ring...
...on
Emily's
hand
as
a
symbol...
...of
the
love
that
Happy
to.
They
have
made
...and
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
You
may
kiss
the
bride.
This
is
worse
than
when
Just
keep
smiling.
Well,
that
went
well.
It
could've
been
worse.
That
was
pretty
funny,
wasn't
it?
The
One
After
Ross
Says
"Rachel"
You
spoiled
everything!
My
friends
and
family
are

there!
No
matter
what
happens
with
them...
...we
still
get
cake,
right?
That's
all
right.
You
take
your
time.
She's

her
makeup.
I
hate
you!
And
I
love
you!
A

That's
true.
Thanks,

Who?
I
discovered
that
Ross
forgot
Without
it,
in
the
brain
of
Ross...
...women's
names
are
interchangeable.
Through
no
fault
of
his
own.
Oh,
my

Phoebe.
No,
not
Phoebe.
Dr.

Oh,
no!
You

it
too!
What
kind
of
bitch

up
I
hope
you
don't
take
this
...but
I
know
we
had
plans
I'm
worried
about
what
it
I
know.
-
How
could
we
have
let
this
happen?
You
know,
look.
In
a
foreign,
romantic
country.
I
blame
London.
Bad
London!
So
look...
...while
we're
still
in
London,
Well,
I
don't
see
that
But
when
we're
back
home,
Only
here.
You
know,
I
saw
I'll
meet
you
there
in
two
minutes.
Mon?
I
gotta
ask
you
something.
Now?
Ross
said
my
name.
I
don't
know.
Monica,
what
should
I
do?
Just
do
the
right
thing.
What?
Tow
the
line!
Thread
the
needle!
I'll
talk
to
Ross
Wait!
Rachel,
no.
He's
married.
Married.
If
you
don't
realize
that,
Okay.
You're
right.
You're
right.
Jack,
is
it
all
our
fault?

are

Joey,
what
are
you
doing?
You
promised,
no
meat
We're
in
another
country,
-
True.
I'm
sorry
things
aren't
working
out.
It
could
be
better.
Oh,
yeah!
Of
course.
So
you
said
my
name.
You
just
said
it
If
you'd
seen
a
circus
freak,
"I
take
thee,
Circus
Freak."
It
didn't
mean
anything.
It
didn't
mean
anything.
Oh,
no!
Of
course
I
can
understand
why
Emily
...because
it
was
you.
But
it
absolutely
didn't.

ready
Oh!
The
band's
ready!
We've
got
to
do
what
the
band
says.
You
spit
on
me,
man!
I'm
sorry.
Emily
is
taking
kind
of
a
long
time.
When
I
locked
myself
up
...I
was
trying
to
pop
Get
the

out
of
there.
I'm
coming
in!
Oh,
look
at
that.
In
the
middle
of

Oh,

So,
what
happened?
Well,
Ross
said
my

But

at
this

No

Hey,

No,

don't.
Well,
we're
hanging
out.
Which

us
will
be
I
suppose
I
would

What
if
we're
watching
a
movie?
And
we've
paid
for
it.
It's
My
Giant.
My
Giant?
I
love
that
movie!
Think
this
is
okay?
Well,
Ross
and
Emily
Oh,
it's
so
beautiful!
I
don't
feel
right
about
this.

is

it.
Nope.
-
She's
not
with
us.
Where
is
she?
She's
in
hiding.
She's
humiliated.
We're
very
sad
that
