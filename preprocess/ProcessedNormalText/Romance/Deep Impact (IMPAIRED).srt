I
was
with
the

since
he's
been
governor
I
came
to

I
moved
here
because
I
was

trusted
the
man...
and
then
he
fucked
me.
He
what?
No,
I
didn't
I
should
say

but
somebody

did.
It
was
about
to

because

Why
not
hang

Do
you

is
what
I
get
for
talking

I'm
selling

name

A

minutes

told
the

what
I
am
about
It's
a
bit
complicated,
so
I
hope
hear
what
I
have
to
say.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
2
American
astronomers,
working
on
a
mountain
top
Shh.
Nobody
say
saw
something
that
caused
them
A
comet.
But
the
comet
was,
well...
There
was
a
remote
possibility
that
could
bring
it
into

Now...
we
get
hit
all
the
time
some
of
them
the
size
of

But
the
comet
we
discovered
From
the
north
side
About
7
miles
long.
Put
another
way,
this
comet
is
larger
It
weighs
500
billion
tons.

are...

left
over
from
the
creation
after
the

were
formed
These
chunks
are
in
an
elongated
orbit
but
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
gets
bumped
like
a
billiard
ball
and
is
knocked
If
this
comet
continues
and
keeps
sometime
on
August
16,
there's
a
chance
So
for
the
past
8
months,
have
been
building

built

call
it

Look.
Where's
Mom?
Behind

Mm-hmm.
And
this

too.
She
was
such
an
artist,
You
don't
remember
I'm
5
years
old.
How
Some
people
do
remember
It
was
such
All
alone
on
the
beach.
And,
of
course,
she
would
but
there
was
no
one
else
and...
she
insisted.
You
know
how
she
is.
How
she
was.
Jenny.
It
was
such
a
good
day
for
all
of
us.
Don't
you
remember?
Keep
them.
Goodbye.

We
can't
do
anything

it
just
might
Without
the
arming
codes,
we're
going
to
have
to
wait
until
we
get
closer
to

We
may
not
have
enough
to
get
back
into
much
less
to
go
down
We
sure
as
hell
don't
have

How
are
we
supposed
to
get

we've
We
don't.
Well,
look
at

Houston,
Nice
of
you

call,
We
were
beginning
what
you
were
doing
Tanner:
Admiring
Fish,
is
that
you?
Yep.
We
don't
have
time
There's
nothing
we
can
do
but
we
do
have
a
plan.
We
need
the
arming
codes
Arming
codes?
We
can
do
or
we
can
teach.

Get
the
arming
codes!
We
have
one
helicopter.
We
can
ferry
6
people
to

take
Jenny
to
the
ARK.

Beth,

are
you
doing?
The
road
was
so
crowded.
I
thought
if
the
wave
comes,
because
she
likes
it
here.
And
we're
on
the
15th
floor,
Say

Beck:
We
watched
as
the
bombs
into
a
million
of
pieces
that
burned
harmlessly
and
lit
up
the
sky
Still,
we
were
left
with
The
waters
as
the
Ohio
It
washed
away
forests
and
skyscrapers.
But
the
water
receded.
The
wave
hit
Europe
Millions
were
lost.
Countless
more
But
the
waters
receded.
Cities
fall...
but
they
are
rebuilt.
And
heroes
die...
but
they
are
remembered.
We
honour
them
with
every
field
we
sow...
with
every
child
we
comfort
in
what
Our
planet.
Our
home.
So
now...
let
us
begin.
