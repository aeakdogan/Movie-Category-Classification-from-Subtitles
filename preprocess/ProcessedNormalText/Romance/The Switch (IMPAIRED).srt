we
crave
most

for
some
people,
It's
when
you

It's

working
its
magic.
And
that's
great
for
them.

But
that's
not
the
way

really
works.
For
the
rest
of
us,
It's
complicated
and
it's
messy.
It's
about
horrible
timing
and
not
being
able
to
say
when
you
need
to

At

that's
the

distinctly
said,
okay?
And
I
am,
I'm
like
a--
that
shouldn't
be
wearing

He
was
mentally
ill,
Kassie,
exactly.
It
was
like
a
Tourette's-style
and
I
was
caught
in
the
cross
hairs.
-
I
can't
believe
this
stuff
bothers
you.
Now,
I
have
some
big
news.
First
I
wanna
show
you
something.
-
Look
at
that.
I
seem
to
have
a
growth.
Oh,
my
God,
is
that
your
scrotum?
-
It's
not
a
sunset.
My
health
exhausts
you?
-
Fine,
we'll
deal
with
my
death
later.
-
See
this?
That's
the
dollar
in

-
Good
for
you.
Now
look
at
it
like
this.
If
someone
you
knew
owned
this
stock
I
don't
know,
Kassie.
I
gotta
look
-
Simple,
simple.
Hold
or
sell?
Exactly.
This,
Wally,
this
is
what
a
woman's
fertility
So?
So
I
would
like
you
I'm
having
a
baby.
-
You're
pregnant?
Went
to
the
doctor,
she
said
all
my
levels
And,
uh,
she
said
that
my
cervical
mucus
-
Thanks
for
that.
Then
she
started
giving
me
this
lecture
and
I
was
really
starting
to
hear
her

And,
you
know,
I
started--
Would
you
please
stop
having
sex
Sorry,
you
know
I
don't
know
And
then
I
thought
to
myself,
I've
got
a,
you
know,
and
I
don't
need
a
man
to
have
a
baby.
Technically
speaking,
you
do.
Is
this
about
Paul?
Why
don't
you
chalk
it
up
as
another
of
This
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
-
I
think
it
does.
All
I'm
saying
is
You
need
to
look
at
your
relationships
-
Deal
with
the
one
before.
I'm
just
tired
of
thinking
about
I'm
just
ready
to
do
it
now.
-
Really?
-
Is
that
from
an
infomercial?
-
Really?
-
Did
you
buy
the
DvD?
But
it
really
was
something
Wally,
I
don't--
I
want
to
have
a
kid,
...semen.
And...
And?
I
need
you
to
help
me
find
some.
So,
what,
are
you
gonna,
like,
You
gonna
read

I
heard
about
this
woman
in
Queens,
she
thought
she
was
buying

out
it
came
Oh,
you
did
not
hear
that.

turned
out

-
Did
I?
Because
we're
not
nearly
done
talking

you're
a
vortex.
I
have
four
interviews
this
week,
Listen.
Now,
what's
wrong
with
my
sperm,
-
With
your
sperm?
Nothing.
-
I'm
sure
you
have
killer
sperm.
But,
you
know,
we're
best
friends.
-
It
is
weird,
you're
right.
-
You
know
what
else?
How
do
I
put
this?
-
You're
a
little
neurotic,
you
know?
-
Little
self-absorbed
and
pessimistic.
And
I'm
not
pessimistic,
sorry,
-
Big
difference.
And
whether
you
can
deal
with
this

Excuse
me.

She
wouldn't
know
good
What
does
she
take
you
for,
a
eunuch?
-
You're
jealous.
It's
perfectly
normal.
This
is
bigtime
primal
stuff
and
you
have
every
right
to
be
upset.
She
put
you
in
the

That's
a
cold
and
inhospitable

now
we're
talking
about

Hey,
so
that
we're
clear,
We
put
each
other
in

Let's
be
honest
with
ourselves.
You
had
your
window
with
Kassie,
and
you
went
all
Wally
on
her
I
went
what?
You
shared
too
much
too
soon.
You
gotta
hide
the
crazy
I
see.
So
just
so
that
I'm
clear,
which
one
of
your
three
failed
marriages
All
three,
Exactly,
so,
okay,
-
Are
you?
Are
you?
Because
I
still
don't
know
why
the
hell
I
told
you
that
I
thought
I
had
a
growth.
Oh,
golly,
I
hope
so.


MAN:
She's
really
ambitious,
huh?
Please
tell
me
you
didn't
invite
Wally.
-
Of
course
I
did.
-
No,
she
broke
up
with
him.

you
know
I've
had

Would
you
stop?
Sorry.
Okay,
here
are
your
talking
points,

know
that
Wally

at

he
tells
it

it

fresh,
you
know?

do

And
after
seven
years,
two
failed
relationships,
one
stock-market
crash,
there
I
was,
right
where
Kassie
left
me.
You
know,
when
my
friend
told
me
Yep,
well...
So
you
gonna
try
to
take
me
off
the
market
Yes,
I
am
thinking
a
June
wedding.
And
then
we'll
move
out
-
Okay.
Um,
New
Jersey?
Course,
I
have
to
work
a
ton

Although
that
could
end
up
I
might
just
be
hiding
from,
you
know,
the
ever-growing
tedium

Which
will
then
create
But
you
seem
like
the
kind
of
person
But,
you
know,
you
would
act
out
in
some
sort
That's
me.
And
I'm
the
kind
of
person
and
probably
end
up
to
deal
with
the
guilt.
Once
I'm
out
of
town,
I
gotta
masturbate
incessantly
and
you're
probably
back
home
And
I'm
gonna
end
up
wearing
300-dollar
jeans
speaking
to
women
because
they're
too
young.

Or
it
could
all
work
out
great.
Absolutely
unbelievable.
Just
shut
up
and
smile.
vOICEMAIL:
KASSIE
:
Guess
what.
I
got
an
amazing
offer
from
ABC,
He's
already
practicing
his
accent.
Now,
call
me.
This
is
very
exciting.
WALLY:
Yeah,
well,
listen,
maybe
we
should
go
by
that,
uh,
wine
bar
You
know,
I
think
that
cheesy
old
maître
d'
-
I
think
he's
still
alive.
WALLY:

Actually,
Sebastian
prefers
Sebastian,
huh?
-
Not
just
gonna
be
you
and
me?
Come
on.
And
you
know
what?
You
should
actually
get
him
something,
-
Nothing
big.
Okay,
well,
I'll
get
him,
um...
I'll
get
him...
KASSIE:
-
Well,
then
what
should
I
get
him?
-
Picture
frames?
-
And
he
doesn't
put
pictures
in
them.
That
is
very
unusual,
Kassie.
-
Debbie's
here.
She
says
hi.
She's
helping
me
unpack.
Oh,
she
made
a
dreamcatcher.
It's
just--
I
don't
know.
So
listen,
um,
Oh,
yeah,
Wally,
Did
you
get
that?
You
can
tell
Debbie
to
get
her
completely
out
of
my
life.
Right.
I
cannot
tell
her
that.
-
Yeah,
all
right.
Okay.
Hi,
I'm
looking
for
a
young
lady
that,
uh--
Oh,
got
it,
right
there.
Pardon
me,
miss?
Wow.
Hi.
-
You
look
great.
Who
took
over
dressing
you?
-
Nobody.
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
How's
Sebastian?
Where
is
he?
But
listen,
if
he's
a
little
strange,
it's
just
he's
having
some
But
he's
watching
the
fish.
-
I
think
he's
gonna
be
just
fine.

I
think
I
have
cyclothymic
disorder.
I
looked
right
at
the
shark
Honey,
I
don't
know
what
that
is,
Sweetie,
this
is
Uncle
Wally.
Say
hi.
-
Hi.
Cyclothymic
disorder:
hyperactivity,
loss
of
interest
Okay,
was
I
not
clear
about
WebMD?
Sebastian,
now,
look,
-
Let's
see
what
he
got
you.
That's
so
sweet,
Wally,
very
sweet.
Oh,
wow.
It's
a
Lunt
Silver
Edition.
-
Where's
the
picture?
The
one
that
comes
with
the
frame.
-
What?
Say
thank
you.
-
Thanks.
Look
at
this.
Okay,
guys.
I
called
ahead
on
the
phone,
Are
you
ready
for
the
best
duck
-
I
can't
eat
duck.
Wally,
do
you
know
what
they
do
to
ducks
No,
no,
sweetie,
I
think
that's
veal.
No,
I
read
about
the
ducks
too.
They
force-feed
the
ducks
through
a
plastic
tube
I
called
on
the
phone,
I
pre-ordered
this.
The
ducks
get
this
liver
disease
and
they
can't
walk.
Nature's
in
crisis,
What's
going
on
here?
He's
stubborn.
Hey,
guess
what.
This
cost
me
$84,
and
it's
gonna
be
about
I
won't
do
it,
Uncle
Wally.
-
And
I'll
hate
you
if
you
do.
We
don't
say
"hate,"
sweetie.
Okay?
-
We
can
have
rice
with
soy
sauce.
That's
a
great
compromise.
He
likes
you.
-
You're
kidding,
right?
Hey,
listen,
will
you
do
me
a
favor?
Would
you
watch
him
-
I
don't
think--
See,
I
have
to
go
to
a
parent,
um,
It
would
really
help
me
out.
I
also
think
it
would
be
good
for
you
guys
you
know,
a
little
get-to-know-me
time.
Hi,
excuse
me.
Hi,
could
I
get
a
soda
and,
uh,
some
steamed
vegetables?

-
Sorry
about
that,
Wally.
I'll
expense
it,
okay?
And
I'll,
uh,
just
cut
it
up
-
It's
better
than
bananas.
The
neck
is
sort
of,
you
know,
so
it'll
slice
up
nice.
KASSIE:
-
Isn't
he
great?
-
He
thinks
I'm
a
lesbian.
I
guess
the
only
mothers
he
knows
SEBASTIAN:
-
Can
I
go
in?
He's
so
smart
and
willful,
and
he
considers
everything,
WALLY:
He
went
in.
What's
a--
What's
a
seed
guy?
Uh,
that's
his--
Part
of
his
birth
story.
This
should
be
good.
It's
the
story
I've
been
telling
him
I
told
him
that
Mommy
but
wanted
you
so
very,
very
much
And
so
she
went
to
the
doctor,
"If
you
go
out
into
the
world
you'll
find
a
very
special
person
who,
will
give
you
seeds,"
so
that
I
can
plant
you
in
my
tummy.
Got
it.
But
I--
You
know,
I've
read
all
the
books
about
how
you're
supposed
to
talk
and
until
it
happens,
when
your
kid
comes
home
crying
because
some
lard-ass
Okay,
I'm
gonna
go
in.

WOMAN:
[SOFT
POP
MUSIC
PLAYING
-
Who
was
that?
-
Who's
Roland?
-
You
still
talk
to
him?
Why?
What
for?
Well,
there's
a
reason
I
didn't
want
You
know,
so
that
when
Sebastian
I
would
have
answers.
And
I'd
like
to
get
to
know
this
guy.
You
know,
Okay,
what's
Mrs.
Roland
gonna
think
There
isn't
a
Mrs.
Roland.
So
I'm
very
sorry
Oh.
Thank
you.
Don't
worry,
it's,
uh...
I
won't
get
into
how
the
marriage
ended.
I
don't
wanna
bore
you
with
the
details
-
Oh.
before
I
can
trust
anyone
We'll
just
leave
it
at
that.
Yeah,
okay,
fair
enough.

So
listen,
you're
under
no
obligation
And
I
know
that
you
didn't
expect
other
than,
um,
you
know,
donating.
Uh,
which
you
did
so
wonderfully,
-
I
don't
mean
that
to
sound
like--
You
know
what
I
meant.
-
if
he
starts
to
ask
questions--
KASSIE:
I
was
honored
to
receive
your
call.
Really?
I
always
wondered
about
this,
you
know,
I
mean,
you
know--
Roland,
would
you
like
to
see
-
I
would
love
that.
-
Ready?
Oh.
He's
beautiful.
Isn't
he?
I
gotta
say,
Kass,
I
see
a
lot
more
of
me
in
him
than
you.

Wow.
ROLAND:
Hey,
I
didn't
get
to
say
this
Your
choice,
It
took
a
lot
of
guts.
It
was
courageous,
-
What?
That's
a
really
kind
thing
to
say.
Well,
it's
true.
Well,
this
went...
Yeah,
for
me
too.
Yeah.
KASSIE:
Coffee
hot?

WALLY:
I've
always
found
penguins
SEBASTIAN:
-
I'm
having
a
birthday
party.
There's
gonna
come
a
time
when
you're
not
gonna
want
people
Why
wouldn't
anyone
want
people
to
know
Because
getting
old
sucks.
Most
people
don't
accomplish
and
they
realize
They
end
up
living
these
quiet
lives
and,
you
know,
just
becomes
a
big
part
of
that.
Do
you
ever
get
scared
Not
specifically
Parkinson's,
I've
had
my
bouts
with
hypochondria.
What's
that?
That's
thinking
that
you
have
diseases
Oh,
my
God,
I
have
that.
WALLY:
Do
you
wanna
tell
me
SEBASTIAN:
Because
you're
a
kid,
SEBASTIAN:
I
don't
wanna
talk
about
it.
What's
his
name?
Aaron
O'Connor.
Aaron
O'Connor.
-
How'd
you
know?
-
You
went
to
P.S.
66?
You
know
you're
gonna
have
to
stand
up
I
don't
want
to.
Well,
then
he's
probably
You
all
right
with
that?
But
he's
bigger
than
me
Oh,
he's
a
karate
guy.
Tell
you
what.
-
What?
No
one
messes
with
the
crazy
guy.
You
just
look
at
him
Funyun.
-
Like
a
don't
give
a
Funyun?
Like
you
don't
care
Just
like
you're
insane.
Crazy
people
are
wild
cards,
You
never
know
what
they're
gonna
do.
It
scares
even
Aaron
O'
Connor.
-
Okay?
He
looks
just
like
you.

He's
not
my
son.
-
How
old
is
he?
Well...
He's
a
little
you.
It's
really
cool.

Hi.
Come
here.
Hey.
Hi.
-
We
went
to
the
zoo,
and
it
was
really
fun.
Oh,
my
gosh,
Wally
showed
me
the
whole
park.
KASSIE:
-
Would
you
grab
my
bag?
KASSIE:
Okay,
tell
me
more
about
it.
So
here's
what
we
got.
If
you
go
with
the
cowboys
again,
you're
gonna
travel
and
you're
gonna
herd
cattle.
But
I
don't
wanna
kill
any
Indians.
Well,
you
don't
have
to
kill
-
What
about
if
I
go
with
the
astronauts?
If
you
go
with
the
astronauts,
that
means
you're
gonna
travel
and
you'll
be
driving
on
the
moon
that
has
a
flag
coming
out
of
the
back.
SEBASTIAN:
KASSIE:
Oh,
my
Lord,
to
the
moon
we
go.
We're
gonna
have
to
decide
who's
gonna
SEBASTIAN:
Hmm.
-
Dead
chicken.

Oh,
poor
dead
chicken.
God,
he's
exhausted.
What
did
you
do
to
him?
WALLY:
Yup,
I
did.
What
are
you
looking
at?
Looking
at
some
really
weird
pictures
Like
this
one.
Are
you
kid--?
-
Fabulous
choice.
What
do
you
mean?
And
how
odd
So
not
like
you.
If
I
had
bunny
ears
like
that,
-
That
was
our
second
date,
right?
And
didn't
you
make
us
dance
-
I
think
you
did.
Yeah.
They
were
like
your
favorite
band
-
You
were,
like,
a
C+C
super
fan.
And
you
kissed
me
at
this
party,
I
think.
I
didn't
kiss--
I
was
in
character.
-
Please.
Do
you
remember
You
were
supposed
to
take
me
home.
Heading
for
the
hills
That
doesn't
sound
like
me.

Wasn't
this
the
trip
that
I
was
supposed
Wasn't
it
your
third,
um...?
SEBASTIAN:
Okay.
I'm
gonna...
I'm
going
to--
-
I
gotta
go
get
into
my
p.j.'s
too.
WALLY:

And
the
most
inventive
LEONARD
:
Hello?
Listen,
I'm
freaking
out
a
little
bit.
LEONARD:
WALLY:
Hello?
Are
you
eating?
No,
no,
no,
I'm
fine.
Well,
you
know,
I
just--

That
somehow--
Hey.
I've
been
hanging
out
with
Sebastian
a
lot
and
there's
these
similarities
I
mean,
I
gotta
run
this
stuff
by
Kassie.
LEONARD:
What's
the
matter?
-
Yes?
-
Like
he's
more
me
than
the
Viking.
Viking?
I
don't
know
why,
vaguely,
Hmm.
Hmm.
Where
are
you
now?
WALLY:
Hang
on.
-
Why
wouldn't
you
tell
me
that
before?
Because
you
never
needed
my
help
I'm
giving
you
everything
I
have.
You
were
so
drunk
and
I
didn't
know
that,
uh,
meant
anything
to
anybody.
-
How--?
What
does
that
mean?
Roland
is
the
viking,
the
viking
is
Roland.
Who
is
Roland?
Kassie's
donor
is
Roland.
He's
the
donor.
Okay,
well,
okay.
So,
what
you're
saying
and
there
was
a
trade
made.
-
Yup.
-
Who--?
For
who?
Who?
I
mean,
you
don't
think
that
I
could
have--?
You're
what?
You're
what?
That
I
could
have
traded
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
How
would
that
have
even
I'm
trying
to
picture
it.
-
I
don't
even
know...
I
mean,
I
don't
know,
I...
LEONARD:
Oh,
jeez.
-
Yeah,
I
think
that
there
was
access.
-
Is
it
starting
to
come
back?
-
I
don't
like
the
way
this
is
going.
I
think
I
got
Sawyer
in
the
bathroom,
Because
Kassie
knows
Diane
Sawyer
WALLY:
I
switched
it.
I--
Oh,
that's--
My
God.
I
hijacked
Kassie's
pregnancy?
Oh,
that's
ill-advised.
How
do
I
not
remember
that?
Well,
because
you
were
horribly
drunk,
You
repress
everything.
You
know,
I've
told
you
If
you
don't
feed
them,
at
some
point
they're
gonna
get
out
-
Exhibit
A.
-
No,
no,
no.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Well,
yes,
but
that's
so
challenging,
It's
the
right
thing
to
do,
Leonard.
Yeah,
maybe,
-
There
are--
-
I
gotta
go
tell
her.
-
Okay.
-
Congratulations,
you're
a
father.

Hi,
Wally.
Hey,
buddy.
What
are
you
doing
awake?
Insomnia.
-
Where's
your
mom?
Mom,
Wally's
here!
KASSIE:

You
can
use
them
any--
-
McKay--
-
...maxed
out--
-
...until
we--
-
Visit
your
loc--
-
Fight
for--
-
Hey,
what
are
you
doing?
No,
you're
not,
actually,
you're
just
incessantly
switching
No,
I'm
watching
all
the
shows
at
once.
WALLY:
Guess
what.
-
Hey,
listen.
We're
gonna
have
to
Because
we're
gonna
be
Why
are
we
gonna
be
in
each
other's
lives
Because,
um,
you
know,
I'm,
uh...
I'm
your--
I'm
friends
with
your
mother.
Well,
that
doesn't
mean
-
So
give
me
the
clicker.
-
No.
-
No.
-
No.
-
No,
Sebastian.
No.
KASSIE:
Wally.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Okay.
Outside.
Outs...?
I'll
be
right
outside.
-
That
is
quite--
-
All
the
way
outside?
Um...
So,
uh,
listen,
I
don't
know
how
to
say
this,
I'm
gonna
start,
um...
You're
the
most
important
person
-
Yeah.
It's
difficult.
It's
like
the
hardest
thing
okay,
because
you
know
We've
known
each
other
so
the
last
thing
I
wanna
do
but
just,
some
things
have
to
be
said,
even
if
they're
uncomfortable--
Stop,
Wally.
I
think
I
know
what
you're
gonna
say.
-
I
don't
think
you
know.
Since
I've
been
back...
And
we
have
known
each
other
Clearly,
we
missed
each
other.
I
would
be
lying
if
I
said
I
didn't
realize
that
there
was
a
definite,
you
know,
I
mean,
sometimes--
-
Energy?
I
mean,
That
you
have
feelings
for
me.
Right?
Not
exactly,
but...
Oh,
my--
Oh,
my
God.
What?
I'm--
You
know
what?
I--
No,
no.
I'm
just
really--
Just
work,
so
I'm
not,
you
know...
WALLY:
Huh?
-
What?
Let's
just
say
good
night.
And,
um,
again,
I'm
sorry,
and
I
just--
You
get
it.
Ouch.
Great.
-
Sebastian,
please
open
the
door.
-
Roland
thing?
Not
a
good
time.
-
Sebastian.
We've
just
been
spending
Is
it
like
dating?
-
I--
Yeah,
I
guess.
I...
Shh.
-
Does
Sebastian
know--?
I've
set
specific
rules.
Sebastian
just
doesn't
like
That's
why
he's
doing
this.
Sebastian.

-
Where
did
Roland
take
you?
-
Like
a
book
reading?
-
What
was
the
reading
about?
-
A
kayak?
-
Sounds
like
a
great
date.
SEBASTIAN:
-
What?
She's
mad.
She's
got
a
boyfriend.
A
few
dates
don't
make
a
boyfriend.
I'm
6,
by
the
way.
-
What's
that?
I'm
not,
I'm
6.
My
birthday's
soon.
Are
you
still
going
to
come
to
my
party?
Yeah,
Sebastian,
I'm
gonna
be
there.


[CHILDREN
YELLING
MAN
1:
MAN
2:
Don't
worry,
I
got
you.
KASSIE:
Yeah,
so
go
get
your
-
It
should
be
fun.
MAN
3:
-
Hi.
-
How
are
you?
Um,
can
we
talk
about
the
other
night?
The
energy
thing.
Wally,
can
we
please
just
forget
that?
I
definitely
think
it's
worth
talking
about
-
Hi.

Who
says
a
small
wall
KASSIE:
-
I
was
just--
-
Baba
ganoush.
You
had
baba
ganoush
Kassie's
party
a
few
years
back.
Yeah.
What
a
memory.
-
Thank
you.
-
I
wanna
give
him
this
gift.
-
Put
it
on.
Seriously.
-
Let
me
take
that
for
you.
No,
come
on,
-
Okay,
you
got
it
now.
-
All
right,
gifts
ahoy.
-
Yeah.
So--
-
And
what
have
you
got
on
today?
-
It's
a
rock-climbing
outfit.
Yeah,
Roland
got
it
for
me
Listen,
come
on,
be
nice.
Pretty
aerodynamic.
-
Can
you--?
Never
mind.
-
I
don't
wanna
climb
the
wall.
-
No,
but
I
promise
you
it's
gonna
be
fun.
Sebastian,
the
whole
reason
is
to
climb
the
wall.
We
don't
want
the
wall
to
go
to
waste,
You
feeling
it?
So
where
did
Sebastian
A
kill
shelter.
A
kill
shelter?
It's
like
a
last-stop
dog
shelter
before
they,
Anyway,
and
he
thought
-
Smart.
-
Because
it
gets
him
active
and
athletic.
WALLY:
I
get
it.
SEBASTIAN:
Get
me
down!
-
Mom!
Just
let
go
of
the
wall,
man,
KASSIE:
-
What
if
it
breaks?
-
Yes.
Sebastian,
you're
gonna
be
okay,
pal.
SEBASTIAN:
I
got
this.
I'm
coming,
buddy.
All
right.
TRAINER:
It's
not
Everest,
chief,
relax.
-
Yeah.
ROLAND:
-
No.
SEBASTIAN:
Stop.
-
I
got
him.
Let
me
go.

-
Stop.
I
hate
that
stupid
wall.
-
Mommy,
I
don't
wanna
be
here.
You're
fine.
You're
all
right.
You're
okay.
I'm
sorry.
It's
okay.
All
right,
don't
worry.
Come
on,
honey,
let's
go--
Boy,
that
was
an
unfortunate
one
for
you,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey,
I
don't
know
you
very
well.
What
do
you
say
we
get
a
drink
-
Um...
Oh,
it's
just
the
most
beautiful
place
Oh,
it's
just
the
most
beautiful
place
-
Have
you
ever
been
to
Michigan,
Wally?
Oh.
I've
got
a
little
cabin
there
Been
in
the
family
for
30
years.
I'm
thinking
of
taking
Kassie
there.
I
mean,
what
do
you
think?
No,
no,
no,
thank
you.
-
You
sure?
Uh,
you
know,
hey,
listen,
The
kid
hates
me,
Wally.
No,
no,
no.
No,
no,
he
does.
Oh,
well,
um...
It's
just,
oh,
man,
he's
got
some,
uh...
-
Rough
edges?
He
worries
a
lot,
he
questions
everything.
-
Neurotic?
So,
what's
the
problem?
Well,
I
don't
really
relate
to
that.
Well...
Neurotic
is
simply
an
intense
form
So
you're
basically
calling
him
and
being
introspective
is
good,
okay?
It's
walking
around
with
an
opinion,
-
with
some
sort
of
nice
kind
of
direction.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
mean,
don't
get
me
wrong,
Thanks.
Hey,
what's
not
beautiful
to
you?
See?
You
did
it
again.
But
that's
how
we're
alike,
Wally,
Sebastian
may
be,
uh,
Life
throws
you
curveballs,
I
mean,
a
few
months
ago,
with
a
woman
A
few
months
ago?
-
Yep.
And
now
I'm
crazy
about
a
woman
How
about
that
curveball?
Bam!
Sebastian's
gonna
get
through
this.
He
doesn't
need
to
have
this
dark
cloud
What
do
you
think,
WALLY:
Oh,
the
guy
was
just--
He
just
kept
going
You
know,
he
thinks
that
it's
his
kid.
Wants
me
to
give
him
advice
on
how
It's
just
like
a
nightmare.
He's
smiling
at
me
all
the
time.
-
Wants
me
to
go
fly-fishing
with
him.
I
don't
understand.
Why
are
we
here?
Because
I
gotta
exchange
this
frame.
-
It's
a
sterling-silver
5-by-7.
Well,
that's
so
nice
that
but,
um,
listen,
is
for
you
to
take
care
of
this
thing
Why
are
we
waiting?
Why
the
wait?
Please,
I
know
that,
all
right?
-
But
everything
is
all
turned
around
now.
I'm
turned
around.
That
night,
Ooh.
That's
a
new
twist.
It
was
very
weird
though.
Her
mouth
is
saying
but
her
eyes
are
screaming,
"Save
me!"
Ah.
So
go
with
that.
Go
with
the
eyes.
And
now
I
think
Really?
You
think
so?
Please,
I
know
you've
been
saying
that
-
Now
I'm
finally
saying
it.
That's
just--
You're
in
love
Meanwhile,
she's
falling
for
Roland.
And
I
know
that
I
could
save
all
of
this
but
if
I
do
that,
I
lose
everything,
right?
And
if
you
don't?
Then
I'll
never
be
more
That's
no
good.
WALLY:
Hi,
excuse
me.
This
is
old,
this
is
new.
-
Yes?
WALLY:

Hang
on.
I
gotta
take
this.
Sorry,
hold
on.
-
Hello?
WALLY:
Hi.
-
I'm
in
Michigan,
and,
um--
Uh,
yes,
Wally,
I'm
with
Roland.
WALLY:
Yeah,
yeah,
it
has
been.
-
He
told
me.
-
Yeah,
we're
very,
very
close.

-
What
was
that
buzzing
noise?
-
They
don't
have
cell
service
up
there?
So,
Wally,
Sebastian
wanted
to
go
And
since
he's
been
having
some
trouble
But
then
Liam's
mom
called
me
-
Lice?
I
did
not
say
leprosy,
okay?
Would
you
please
not
Wally
this
Hang
on,
Yeah,
yeah,
I
did.
I
do
that
sometimes.
Listen,
Wally,
I
trust
you,
and
you're
the
only
person
that
he
can
stand.
I've
been
beating
myself
up
I
have
a--
There's
no
flights
tonight,
so
I
really--
-
You
know,
I'm--
I
pick
him
up,
You
don't
take
him
Okay,
so
your
place
-
What
do
you
want
from
me?
But
there's
a
couple
more
things
that
Do
you,
um...?
Do
you
have
a
pen?
WALLY:
KASSIE:
After
you've
picked
up
There's
one
on
our
corner.
Buy
a
box
of
heavy-duty
garbage
bags,
The
doctor
already
called
in
Here
we
go,
Aisle
10.
Where
is
it?
There
we
go,
there's
the
Tide,
-
Trash
bags
are
right
there.
Yellow
drawstring.
Boom.
KASSIE:
stuff
all
of
his
clothes
in
a
trash
bag
Here
we
go.
All
right,
arms
up,
arms
up.
And
now
I'll
get
you
to
sit
down
over
here.
Okay,
real
good,
there
we
go.
KASSIE:
Make
sure
he
keeps
the
stuff
And
whatever
you
do,
And
while
he's
doing
that,
you
can
strip
both
beds
of
pillowcases,
All
right,
we
just
gotta
get
And
let
me
get
this.
KASSIE:
And
then
bag
up
all
of
Make
sure
those
bags
are
shut
airtight
And
throw
everything
in
the
wash
WALLY:
WALLY
:
This
is
not
Please
just
let
me
shave
his
head
KASSIE:
Wally.
KASSIE:
But
whatever
you
do,
Wally,
And
make
sure
to
follow
the
instructions
Everything
okay?
You
all
right?
KASSIE:
Oh,
and
just
one
more
thing,
There's
this
little
comb.
WALLY:
-
What?
Just
keep
looking
that
way,
pal.

Are
they
everywhere?
Huh?
No,
they're
fine.
They're
absolute--
You're
fine.
Are
you
gonna
throw
up?
No,
I'm
not
gonna
throw
up.
SEBASTIAN:
Did
you
find
some?
I
got
them.
WALLY:
I
think
we
are
now
officially
deliced.
Or
"-loused,"
right?
"Deloused"?
Whatever
it
is,
Or
is
it
5?
All
right,
good
night.
Sweet
dreams,
okay?
This
is
your
collection,
right?
Huh?
Why
don't
you
wanna
use
any
Why
does
everyone
ask
me
that?
Because,
you
know,
inside
their
frames.
But
they
already
have
pictures
in
them.
That's
true,
SEBASTIAN:
See,
like
these
people.
That's
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Owen,
He
studies
volcanoes,
and
Mrs.
Owen
used
to
work
for
a
place
WALLY:
Well,
that's
funny,
look
like
third-rate
That's
my
grandfather.
-
Which
one,
right
here?
This
guy?
He's
my
father's
dad.
He
owns
a
boat.
He
takes
it
out
every
day
And
he
knows
a
lot.

Did
you
know
No,
but
I
do
now.
That's
my
Uncle
Rick.
He's
my
father's
younger
brother.
-
This
guy
here?
He
got
me
an
iPod
for
my
birthday.
But
I
think
he
stole
it
from
somebody
What's
your
dad's
family
like?
I
don't
know.
I
never
met
them.
Why
not?
My
father
left
when
I
was...
When
I
was
pretty
young.
You
can
keep
it.
WALLY:

See,
now,
I
think
you
put
What
you've
got
there
is
like
a--
I
mean,
we
could
spackle
these
walls
I
think
you
need
to
put
-
All
right?
Let's
think
of
something
else

What
about,
um,
chocolate
chips?
Your
mom
got
any
of
those?
SEBASTIAN:
Maybe.
Let's
go
the
other
way
with
it,
right?
Let's
make
it
a
little
bit
more
-
Why
not?
You
like
cheese?
What
is
so
funny
to
you
-
I
don't
know,
it's
just
funny.
If
we
burn
them,
you
get
a
little
crunch.
-
Hi,
hey.
-
Mommy,
I
wanna
show
you
the
dead
lice.
-
Come
here.
What
do
you
have
in
that
jar?
Lice?
-
Lice.
-
Wally
hunted
them
and
killed
them
all.
-
Is
it
all
out?
-
Oh,
I
love
you.
I'm
gonna
take
the
dead
lice
That's
a
cute
look.
Oh,
this
is,
um...
I
was
starting
to
feel
itchy,
You
don't
have
lice.
-
Uh,
I
could.
I
could
actually
have
lice.
And
I
really
thank
you.
-
Thanks
for
taking
care
of
him.
-
How
was
that
weekend?
It
was
good.
It
was
really
beautiful.
You
know,
from
logs
that
they
milled

And
we're
gonna
go,
I
think,
Really?
That's--
-
It's
getting
serious,
huh?
We're
actually,
um,
That's...
I
mean,
you
know,
Kassie,
I...
-
That's
a
mistake.
I
think
that
this
guy...
--is
a
mistake.
Don't
do
this.
Don't
ruin
this
for
me.
-
Hang
on.
Kassie.
Come
on,
look,
he
started
the
year
Look,
he's
obviously
going
and
maybe
he
doesn't
realize
it,
but
it
looks
like
he
might
be
using
you
You
know
that
I
actually
thought
But
you
haven't.
I'm
trying
to
move
forward
with
my
life,
The
truth
is,
I'm
actually
happy.
-
Are
you?
Roland
is
a
really
good
guy,
all
right?
Just
because
you've
never
taken
a
risk
doesn't
mean
At
least
I'm
trying
to
let
somebody
in.
You
should
try
it
sometime.
I
mean,
unless
you
have
something
else
Wally?
Really?
Got
nothing
for
me,
huh?

-
Nothing?
Hey,
Wally,
You
gotta
try
some
of
this
beer

"ALL
THE
BEAUTIFUL


Sebastian,
what's
going
on?
I
was
at
Ethan's
birthday
party
Aaron
O'Connor
was
there.
I
stood
up
to
him
and
acted
crazy.
Look
at
your
face.
He
punched
me
and
then
hit
me
again.
Come
here.
-
He
didn't
care
that
I
was
crazy.
It
didn't
work,
I
tried.
Where
was
this?
Where
was
the
party?
-
At
the
park.
-
East
End.
That's
like
20
blocks
away
from
here.
Um,
I'm
gonna
call
your
mom
No,
Wally,
you
have
to
take
me
home.
Take
me
home,
Wally.
Sebastian,
why
did
you
come
here?
Because
I
thought
you'd
be
proud
of
me.


Oh,
my
God,
honey,
-
I
got
into
a
fight.
-
Why
didn't
Donna
call
me?
I
told
him
to
do
something
really
stupid
But
he's
fine.
KASSIE:
-
Yeah,
and--
WALLY:
Oh,
what's
going
on?
We're
just
having
a
little
brunch.
-
Hey,
Wally.
KASSIE:
Come
on,
let's
go.
Oh,
my
God,
you're
covered
in
dirt.
KASSIE:
Come
on,
honey,
DEBBIE:
Let's
go
in
the
kitchen.
Somebody
punched
you?
-
Hey,
Wally.
What
happened?
-
He
got
in
a
fight
with
another
kid.
-
Yeah.
I
took
a
few
lumps
when
I
was
a
kid,
-
Who
are
here.
You
gotta
meet
them.
Oh,
wait,
hold
on.
Check
it
out.
Right?
Stick
around.
It's
gonna
get
good.
I'm
sorry,
Roland.

For
what?
KASSIE:
Doesn't
feel
that
bad,
huh?
WALLY:
Hey.
SEBASTIAN:
I'm
okay.
Act
crazy,
Wally?
Remind
me
to
never
to
ask
you
for
advice
What
do
you
want
from
me,
Debbie?
-
Debbie--?
I
will
be
right
back.
-
It
was
just
talk.
What
got
into
him?
You
wanna
try
these
peas?
All
right,
Wally,
what
is
it?
I,
uh...
There
she
is.
Yeah,
come
on
in,
take
a
seat.
-
Listen,
hang
on
one
second.
Kass,
come
on
in.
You
too,
Wally.
KASSIE:
Okay.
Everybody
listen
up.
Hush,
hush.

Got
a
little
something
to
say.
Everybody.

All
right.

A
few
months
ago,
and
I'm
not
gonna
lie,
-
Um,
I
was
in
a
world
of
pain.
I
really
have
to
talk
to
you.
ROLAND:
My
wife,
ex-wife...
--had
left
me
for
reasons
WALLY:
-
And
then...
-
...one
day...
--the
heavens
opened,
and
the
sweet
voice
of
an
angel

And
I
am
happy
to
say
that
my
life
is
whole
again.
Today
Sebastian
Wally,
take
a
seat,
Roland,
I'm
sorry,
you're
a
really
good
guy.
ROLAND:
Hate
to
do
what?
When
Sebastian
needed
someone
today,
You
know,
he
needed
me.
All
right,
I'm
talking
about
something
I,
uh...

I
hijacked
your
pregnancy.
I'm
the
seed
guy.
What?
I
replaced,
uh,
Roland's
offering
your
party.
Um...

Sebastian's
my
son.
I
know
it
was
a
reckless
and
careless
but,
I
mean,
I
panicked,
you
know.
I'm
not
like
you,
you
know.
You're
not
afraid
of
anything.
I
can't
even
take
risks,
you
know,
But
nothing
scares
you,
Kassie,
I
mean,
you're
gonna
hate
me
and
you're
never
gonna
forgive
me,
It
just--
It
breaks
my
heart,
it
kills
me,
because
he's
changed
me.
You've
changed
me,
and,
um...
...I
love
you.
I
couldn't
say
that
before,
And
I'm
also
saying
I'm
sorry.
I'm
really
sorry.
DEBBIE:
Don't
ever
speak
to
us
again.
What
did
I
miss?

WALLY:
His
what?
Oh,
my
God.
I
am
proud
of
you.

-
Wally,
it's
4
a.m.
I
did
the
right
thing,
Leonard.
-
Come
on
in.
That's
good,
Wally.
That's
real
good.
But
I
lost
her.
And
Sebastian.
You
did
the
right
thing.
-
It
sucks.
You
know,
You
should
go
home,
Wally.
They
are
my
home,
Leonard.


So
I've
thought
about
it,
and,
uh,
you
can't
just
disappear
So...
You
know,
he's
your
son.
And
of
course
you
can
see
him.
But
it's
gonna
be
on
my
terms.
How's
he
doing?
He
misses
you.
-
I
miss
him.
Is
he--?
Yeah.
I,
uh...
I
couldn't
go
through
with
that.
-
What
happened?
What
do
you
mean?

He's
affectionate.
Likes
me
to
try
new
things.
He
doesn't
turn
into
a
psycho
He
doesn't
moan
when
he
eats.
I
turned
him
down
because
he's
not
you.
Will
you
marry
me?
Probably.
WALLY:
Running
around,
always
rushed,
always
late.
Guess
that's
why
they
call
it
But
sometimes
it
slows
down
just
enough
Fate
works
its
magic.
And
you're
connected.
KASSIE:
Oh.
Hi.
-
What
is
that?
and
my
burnt
arm
hairs.
-
Is
that
working
for
you
at
all?
Shame
there
are
all
these
children
I
don't
mind
an
audience.
-
You
don't?
Oh,
God,
no.
Honey,
here,
ice
cream.
One
of
these
children
has
a
milk
allergy,
It
might
be
the
little
blond
one
there.
-
Just
go
with
a
sorbet
or
something?
-
You
sure?

WALLY:
Every
once
in

while,
something
unexpected
happens,
And

starting
to
feel,
is
that
maybe
the
human
race
isn't
a
race
at
all.
