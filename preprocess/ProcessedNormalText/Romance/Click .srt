said
to
myself,
"Let's

Basically

My

I'm

That's
my
boy!
You're
not
my
dad.

As
far
as
you
know.
I
was
just
joking.
Is
he
really
my
dad?
Come
on,
come

Yes,
Ben.
Honey,

so
great.
Whoa,

a
dolphin
You

I
saw
you.
You

in
there,

Then
what
stroke
was
he
doing,
Dad?
Hey.
Good
thing
is,
He
didn't
see
me
finish.
He
was
hanging
out
-
Yeah,
what
was
that
about,
huh?
I'm
gonna
let
him

Nobody

Really?
Cute.
Hello?
Mr.
Ammer.
Ben,
honey,
slow
down.
That's
his
second
one
Keeps
eating
more
and
more.
He's
like
a
machine.
He's
not.
He's
just
doing
whatever
Everything
Michael's
been
doing
lately
He's
gonna
kill
himself.
Like
a
signature
building
Oh,
my
God.
Scared
the
crap
out
of
me.
Dad,
how
much
longer
-
One
minute.

Daddy's
gonna
die
in
one
minute!
Don't
worry.
I'm
not
dying.
I'm
gonna
live
for
200
years.

Promise?
You
son
of
a
bitch!
Hey!
There
are
families
here!
Show
some
respect,
Go

But

however,
Okay.

Very

One,

First

like
his
father,
-
Ben.
-
Sorry,
Grandma.
A
good
magician
Your
daddy
has
wanted
to
know
...since
he
was
your
age.
Isn't
that
true,
son?
Hey,
Michael.
Jesus.
I'm
talking
to
my
boss,
Ma.
Oh,

You

My
mother

On

Big

That's

Get
some
sleep.
Thank
you,

Are
you
done?
Can
we
relax
now?
Eat
me,
grandpa!
You're
dead.
-
Oh,

I
kicked
your
father's
ass
Now
I'm
gonna
kick
yours!
I
hate
that
man.
Okay,
good
night,

two
cowboys.

Reach

the
sky,
Pocahontas.
Come
on.
Pocahontas
is
off
duty.
You

sick,
sheriff?
I
don't
got
time
to
be
sick,
so
no.
I
need
to
watch
this
documentary
Well,
you
gotta
get
some
rest
Besides,
the
woodland
creatures
...if
you
collapse
trying
Yeah.
I
forgot
to
tell
you.
We
gotta
postpone
Ammer
put
me
on
a
project.
It's
due
Tuesday.
If
I
don't
finish,
The
kids
have
been
talking
Think
I
don't
know
that?
It's
just
every
choice
I
make,
...I
disappoint
somebody.
Make
sure
you
don't
keep
I'm
not
out
drinking
or
gambling
I'm
working
my
ass
off
...than
I
dreamed
of
The
only
way
for
that
to
happen
So
relax,
hon.
Are
you
kidding
me?
Will
you
give
me
a
break
one
time?
Damn
it!
The
O'Doyles
got
We're
gonna
have
one
too.
I'm
sick
of
this.
You
want
me
to
open
Closed.
Closed.
Open.
Bed
Bath
&
Beyond
it
is.
Hey,
man?
You
guys
got
any
universal
-
For
a
shower
curtain
or
a
bathmat?
I
don't
think
so.
You
got
a
remote
for
a
blanket?
Sorry,
I
don't
work
here.
You're
kidding
me.
Actually,
yes.
I
don't
have
any
friends.
Wow,
man.
Bed.
Bed.
Bath.
Bath.
Bed.
So
tired
of
my
life.
Beyond?
Sorry
to
sneak
up
on
you.
I
just-
You
guys
got
a
universal
Something
stinks
All
right,
that's
probably
me.
You
know,
fast
food
Yeah,
that's
what
I
heard.
But
the
way
my
life's
been
going
You're
looking
Yeah.
Just
one
device
...make
my
life
a
little
easier,
I'm
not
supposed
to
do
this,
Hey.
Somebody
noticed.
Thank
you.
I'm
gonna
show
you
a
remote
...that's
probably
the
most
advanced
...we
have
in
this
place.
-
Sounds
sweet.
The
latest,
greatest
universal
remote
I
guess
the
O'Doyles'
remote
can
bite
I
don't
know
the
O'Doyles...
...but
they
can
bite
it
hard.
Yeah.
Come
in
the
back
with
me.
Okay.
This
is-
This
is
very
nice
of
you.
-
What's
your
name,
anyways?
Morty,
I'm
Michael
Newman.
Michael
Newman.
I'm
about
to
rock
your
world.
Okay.
I
gotta
be
honest
with
you.
This
place
Just
kidding.
Hey,
hey.
I
think
maybe
there
in
the
middle?
Sneaky.
Where's
the
box?
Not
necessary.
Just
point,
click.
Eventually,
it
will
program
itself.
How
much
is
this
thing?
Because
I
ain't
exactly
Lucky
for
you,
it's
not
So
I'm
gonna
have
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
Want
me
to
take
my
shirt
off
for
you?
Hey.
Man,
get
out
of
here.
Why
are
you
doing
this,
then?
Because
good
guys
need
a
break
Take
it.
Enjoy.
All
right.
Only
one
thing
This
item
is
nonreturnable.
Why
would
I
wanna
return
something
Twinkie.
You
don't
need
it.
You
do
need
a
Yodel,
though.
Let's
see
what
you
got,
mate.
Look
at
me,
turning
my
own
TV
on.
-
residential
architecture...
-
So
I
talked
to
the
kids.
They're
very
understanding
about
-
Great.
That's
a
great
idea.
Thanks
for
being
-
Can
I
ask
you
something?
After
you
do
all
this
work
and
become
...do
you
think
you're
gonna
...or
are
things
just
gonna
get
Wait.
When
I
get
to
that
place
...a
millionaire,
a
big
shot,
...is
hire
a
bunch
of
idiots
just
like
me
So
then
you,
me
and
the
kids
You
just
gotta
give
me
some
time.
Don't
give
me
that
look.
I'm
just
saying,
give
me
some
support.
I
love
you.
Go
to
sleep.
-
Just
think
about
it,
Michael.
And
stop
with
the
Yodels.
-
You're
gonna
wake
up
400
pounds.
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Keep
it
down,
dude.
You
gotta
poop
again?
Why
don't
you
do
the
humpy-pumpy
Will
you
just
hold
it
in
for
five
minutes
I
guess
when
you
combine...
...mass
quantities
of
cough
syrup
...you
get
acid.
Go.
Hey,
you
said
you
gotta
go.
Sniffy
Longdroppings,
today.
Holy
motherfu-!
Yeah,
I
mean,
you're
right.
...plastic
surgery
is
a
hassle.
But
six
months
later...
...I'm
gonna
have
a
face
...that's
gonna
get
me
to
places
Oh,
my
mother,
typical,
"Oh,
this
procedure
is
too
risky.
"
If
Samantha
wanted
her
cheekbones
I
know,
but
I
just
think,
you
know,
You
should
get
some
work
done.
Then
maybe
Michael
Morning,
Michael.
Morning,
Janine,
You're
just
jealous
because
Donna
...and
all
the
guys
Michael
knows
Forever
and
ever,
babe.
Sorry
about
last
night.
Oh,
my
God.
I
want
that
so
bad.
A
husband
that
I
can
kiss
and
love
You've
already
cheated
on
three
I
think
you've
given
enough
juice
Love
juice.
You
know
way
too
much
about
me.
I
should
never
have
done
Even
Montel
Williams
...and
he's
seen
a
lot
of
shit.
I
was
desperate
for
companionship!
All
of
my
husbands...
All
of
them
They
went
to
work.
You
had
sex
-
You're
a
horndog.
-
Okay,
sweetie.
Calm
it
down.
I
have
had
self-esteem
issues
I
had
a
rabbit
named
Pepper.
Even
the
rabbit
did!
Even
the
rabb-
Don't
look
at
me!
-
What's
wrong
with
me?
Here's
the
pitch
to
Matsui.
Oh,
my,
it's
out
of
here!
A
two-run
shot
into
the
right-field
I'm
sorry.
What
was
that?
She
has
so
many
problems.
I
don't
know,
I-
Hello.
I
gotta
go.
Yeah,
good
RoboDog.
And
he
can
bark
It's
so
cool.
Yeah,
it's
much
cooler
Hey,
Dad,
see
Kevin's
Yeah,
yeah.
Very
nice.
"Very
nice"?
This
thing
-
Not
anymore
it
ain't.
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Okay.
Is
this
some
sort
Morty?
Where
are
the
cameras?
Got
everybody
in
on
it,
huh?
All
right,
America!
Have
your
laugh!
Donna,
I'm
gonna
get
you!
Fast-forward.
Nobody's
laughing
at
you,
Michael.
You
wanted
a
universal
remote
control
Yeah,
but
what
controls
Oh,
Morty
likes
it
too.
Michael,
just
hit
menu.
On
the
remote?
No,
the
menu
at
the
Red
Lobster.
Where
are
we?
-
Go,
Michael,
go!
-
What
have
I
got
here?
Cough
syrup's
kicking
in
again.
-
We
have
a
boy!
What
is
this?
-
All
right,
I
love
you,
Michael.
My
life
has
a
commentary?
It's
chock-full
of
goodies.
-
Click
it.
This
is
last
Tuesday.
Michael
was
eagerly
awaiting
Who's
that,
James
Earl
Jones?
James
Earl
But
his
anticipation
...as
he
realized
Alice
...instead
of
a
hamburger
A
cheeseburger?
She
always
does
this
to
me.
Michael
considered
demanding
...but
decided
not
to...
...fearing
that
Alice
may
spit
in...
...or
otherwise
defile
A
wise
decision...
...for
that
was
exactly
-
Are
you
kidding
me?
My
God.
What
else
we
got
here?
-
"Making
of"?
Hey,
hey,
psychedelic.
Is
this
a
porno
or
something?
Oh,
Ted.
Oh,
Teddy!
Is
that
my
parents?
They're
making
you.
-
That's
the
spot.
Change
the
channel!
I
can't
see.
-
What
happened?
The
floor
is
so
mushy
and
slippery.
Check
it
out.
I
believe
we're
sometime
Okay,
very
good,
Mrs.
Newman.
No!
We're
in
my
mother's
vagina?
Again.
And
push.
-
It's
a
girl.
-
Oh,
It's
a
girl.
Thank
you
so
much.
Wait
a
minute.
What
do
you
mean,
"might
be"?
Maybe
that's
a
penis.
Maybe
that's
a
pe-?
That's
a
penis.
Can
I
see
that?
See?
-
That's
a
tiny
schmeckel.
-
We
have
a
boy!
Your
mother
must
have
...because
I
didn't
see
anything.
Let's
get
out
of
here.
So
if
you
think
about
it...
...I
can
reexperience
It's
amazing.
What
happened?
Hello?
How
do
I
get
you
Gotcha.
I'm
not
freaked
out
enough?
It's
simple.
Think
of
a
time
...hit
rewind,
and
you're
there.
Time
and
a
place.
Time
and
a
place.
Oh,
my
God.
Lake
Winnipesaukee.
That's
me
in
the
Jets
shirt.
Go,
little
me,
go!
Good
hands!
Nice
hands.
Michael!
Michael,
dinner's
almost
ready.
So
any
of
you
wanna
come
Or
we
could
eat
at
my
Winnebago
Three's
Company.
That's
humiliating.
Mom,
why
can't
we
camp
in
an
RV
Oh,
come
on.
How
can
you
get
close
to
nature
Plus,
it's
more
fun
to
have
Don't
you
know
it.
-
No
cupcakes
yet.
I
agree
with
you,
Michael.
I
am
so
hungry,
I
could
eat
this.
Oh,
this
is
where
How
the
heck
did
he
do
that?
Oh,
it's
a
trick
coin
I
just
couldn't
let
him
know
That's
sweet.
Now,
I
gotta
get
back
to
work,
It's
a
very
powerful
device.
Okay.
Who
are
you?
You
know
who
I
am.
Morty?
If
you
have
any
questions...
...call
me.
No,
Linda,
I
think
Stacy
gets
You
wanted
to
see
me?
Michael.
Look,
I'm
heading
out
to
I'm
counting
on
you.
This
hotel
project?
It's
a
big
fish.
You
reel
it
in
for
me
Okay.
Thank
you.
Screw
it
up,
though,
and
it's
Mr.
Ammer,
Denise
just
called.
She's
gotta
go
to
rehab
again,
I'm
gonna
be
alone
Mr.
Ammer,
if
you
need
female
...my
wife's
friend
Janine,
wow.
Really?
What's
she
like?
Let's
just
say
Excuse
me.
I'm
sorry
to
interrupt...
-
...
but
this
is
kind
of
important.
-
Go
to
the
bathroom.
Dude!
You
suck
so
bad.
Do
not.
Hey,
Dad.
How
you
doing,
buddy?
Actually,
we're
playing
some
drop,
Darn
it.
You're
a
regular
Derek
Jeter
-
Love
you,
kid.
Mommy!
No,
I
know.
Well,
I
thought
But
did
you
see
her
Kate
Spade
Wait,
hold
on
a
second,
Trudy.
-
I
told
your
parents
to
come
for
dinner.
It'd
be
fun
for
them
to
be
here
Okay,
so
great.
Yeah.
We'll
see
you
guys
later.
It's
not
gonna
kill
you
to
eat
dinner
I
know,
I
just
gotta
build
-
I'm
the
leader!
Go
say
hi
to
Daddy.
Go
on.
I
can't
take
a
whole
night
of
this.
-
And
I'm
not
going
to.
Cool.
I
can
skip
chapters.
What
a
family.
All
right,
let's
get
dinner
Next.
Everyone's
done
but
you,
buddy.
Will
you
stop
already?
Oh,
boy,
Dad's
quarter
trick.
Alone
in
my
basement
at
last.
Should
I
do
my
work
Let's
get
to
it.
-
Michael?
We
don't
wanna
interrupt.
We're
taking
off.
You
had
a
fun
time
That
was-
We
did
good,
right?
-
Good
night,
honey.
My
schmeckel
got
bigger
now
that
It
couldn't
have
gotten
any
smaller.
Yeah,
yeah.
It
looked
like
a
little
Tic
Tac.
Yeah,
come
here,
-
Bye,
you
guys.
Good
night,
sweetie.
Great
dinner,
honey.
See?
Was
that
so
bad?
Kidding
me?
I
had
fun.
Good
for
you.
Can
you
watch
the
gang
Can't
you?
I
just-
Oh,
you
got
stuff
to
do?
I
got
ghost
stories,
charades,
...and
then
I
gotta
sew
the
duck's
head
...and
fix
his
butthole.
Way
to
go,
champ.
I
wish
I
had
time
to
do
all
that
stuff.
Give
me
a
break,
Michael.
You're
a
big
boy.
I'm
asking
for
10
minutes,
You
don't
have
to
do
that
much.
How
big
a
deal
is
that?
I
skipped
the
whole
fight.
Babe?
-
I
can't
sleep.
I
feel
bad
that
we
keep
arguing.
I
know.
Don't
be
upset,
okay?
-
I
was
a
jerk.
-
I
love
you.
-
Yes.
That
smells
good.
Michael.
Stop
it.
They
ain't
gonna
hear
us.
Come
on.
Okay.
Quietly
try
I
gotta
get
back
to
work.
No,
we
can't
just
do
it.
I
mean,
I
don't
have
any
new
moves
Just
think
of
last
time
and
use
that.
I
like
the
old
moves.
Come
on.
All
right.
This
time
you
be
Sundance,
-
Yeah?
Great,
I
love
giving
massages.
Massaging
away
here.
Oh,
that
feels
good.
-
We
did
it?
I
didn't
want
the
whole
thing
I
don't
think
anybody
did.
Yeah.
I'll
get
you
next
time.
Thanks.
So
we
good
for
tomorrow?
What
are
you
talking
about?
At
dinner.
You
said
we'd
go
to
lunch
tomorrow
Dad's
gift
is-
-
Of
course.
I
said
so,
so
I'll
be
there.
-
Need
another
massage
or
anything?
I
gotta
go
work.
Hey,
Morty.
It's
Michael
Newman.
Yeah,
can
I
talk
to
you
for
a
minute?
Hang
on
for
a
second,
-
Hello,
Michael.
You
don't
wanna
know.
-
Can
we
take
a
walk?
It's
simple.
You
must
Autopilot?
That's
what
happens
to
you
-
Okay.
Here.
See?
That's
you
on
autopilot.
The
lights
are
on
The
remote
lets
your
mind
...but
your
body
actually
stays
put
We
should
go
to
lunch
tomorrow
Sounds
good.
So
she
did
tell
me.
I'm
having
conversations
You're
not
gonna
be
Everyone
goes
on
autopilot
The
big
difference
...to
help
you
decide
when.
This
thing
is
the
best.
By
the
way,
your
wife?
-
She
is,
isn't
she?
You
okay?
-
Amazing.
She
fell
for
a
schlub
like
you.
I'm
a
schlub?
I
don't
know
about
that,
pal.
You
wanna
see
what
a
stud
All
right,
let's
take
a
look
...I
used
to
fool
around
with
Is
that
a
man
or
a
woman?
It's
a
woman.
What
is
this,
Animal
Planet?
-
Stop.
Sometimes
it's
better
to
keep
So
I've
learned,
Morty.
Good
night.
Thank
you.
Good
night,
Michael.
I'm
getting
sick,
man.
Michael,
honey,
wake
up.
What?
It's
Monday
already?
Are
you
kidding
me?
I
skipped
an
entire
cold?
Thanks
to
you,
baby!
I
love
you!
No
more
Tylenol!
I
don't
remember
doing
But
apparently
I
did.
-
Bad
news.
There's
no
hot
water.
Well,
you're
gonna
freeze
It's
all
good.
Yes!
Look
at
me.
All
showered
and
dressed
I
like
that.
I-
Did
you
smoke
crack,
Daddy?
Just
watch
your
toons
and
have
Eating
cupcakes
like
your
old
man.

Dad?
Are
you
gonna
have
to
work
late

Unfortunately,
yes.
Well,
I'm
gonna
be

you
guys
have
any
cool
ideas,

paper.
Would

Let's
see
here.
Look
at
that.
Yeah,
the
river
in
the
lobby.
Where
did
you
find
the
time
-
I
guess
I
can
do
it
all,
sir.
All
right,
all
right,
everybody.
Now,
anyone
can
be
a
victim
Blue
collar,
white
collar,
Even
the
office
slut.
Not
that
I'm
mentioning
any
names...
...Stacy.
Here

go.
Sexual
harassment
You
see,
what
is
hilarious
to
some,
Let
me
try
to
give
you
a
real-life
Like
the
day
I
said,
"You
want
I
was
technically
engaged
Hilarious
sexual
harassment,
Now,

is
also
Now,
this
is
like

says
something
cheeky.
Proceed.
I
don't
know
about
you
Americans...
...but
to
me
there
is
no
doubt...
...Ichiro
is
the
greatest
of
all
time.
Yeah,
he's
incredible.
You
gotta
admit,
Oh,
Matsui.
Well,
if
you
guys
love
Ichiro
and
I'll
eat
anything.
-
Excuse
us
for
a
moment.
See
you
guys
in
a
bit.
Ichiro
and
Matsui
are
baseball
players.
I'm
going
to
the
bathroom
I'll
be
here.
These
morons
are
so
boring.
They
make
me

bad
documentary
Who

as
you
can.
Then
we

Jell-O
shots

America's
T.G.I.
Friday's.
T.G.I.
Friday's!

All
right,
Michael,

us.
Before
we
order,
I
was
looking
After
getting
to
know
you
a
little
bit,
In
fact,
let's
just
throw
it
out,
all
right?
The
river
in
the
lobby
idea,
Let's
just
keep
the
plans
simple,
forget
That's
what
it's
all
about
anyways,
But
do
me
a
favor.
Just
give
us
That
way
we
can
get
the
hell
out
...do
some
Jell-O
shots
Fuck,

That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
Yes,
yes!
The
king
is
home!
Hello,
hello!
How
can
you
goons

You

it?
Well,

your
sweet
little
buns
Come

get
them.
-
Awesome!
No
way!
-
It
must
have
cost
a
million
dollars!
You
guys
deserve
the
best...
...and
that's
what
you're
gonna
get
What's
all
this?
Look
who's
here.
-
Yeah!
Wake
the
O'Doyles,
These
are
the
coolest
bikes
Kevin
O'Doyle's
gonna
shit
himself.
-
Don't
think
I
forgot
my
beautiful
wife.
It's
not
a
bike
or
a
cowboy
hat,
-
Oh,
Michael,
it's
beautiful.
-
I
love
it!
I
got
myself
a
celebratory
cigar
too.
What
are
we
celebrating?
"What
are
we
celebrating?"
...I'm
Ammer's
newest
partner-
Oh,
my
God,
you're
kidding!
I
knew
it!
I
knew
you'd
be
psyched!
I
single-handedly
landed
That's
incredible.
-
I
heard
our
song
on
the
radio.
Honey.
The
song
that
was
playing
Come
on.
You're
kidding
me,
right?
I
know
our
song.
Our
song.
Of
course
What
the
hell
was
that
song?
I
remember
this
place.
And-
Oh,
my
God.
Wolverine's
goofy
cousin.
But
look
at
you.
Wow.
Oh,
yeah,
the
notes.
Smooth,
buddy.
Oh,
look
at
her.
What's
gonna
happen?
Okay.
Seal
the
deal,
pal.
All
she's
thinking
about
is,
Absolutely
not,
Wait
a
minute.
Yeah,
Newman.
Get
it.
Yeah.
Donna!
Donna.
Oh,
my
God.
I'm
so
horny
now.
Oh,
God,
I'm
not.
"Linger"
by
The
Cranberries
And,
my
God,
you
looked
beautiful
Honey,
you
remember
Of
course.
I
remember
She
scared
the
shit
out
of
me
then.
I
love
you.
I
love
you
too,
honey.
Hi,
Mr.
Newman.
Right
this
way,
Michael.
Hey,
my
new
star.
Congratulations.
All
right.
I
am
a
little
tired.
The
family
was
up
late
You
really
knocked
one
out
of
the
park
Hey,
you
were
great
too.
All
you
gotta
do
is
draw
up
If
Watsuhita
commits
...I'm
looking
at
my
new
partner.
I
thought
I
was
already
your
partner.
Whoa,
cowboy.
I
said,
"Land
the
Watsuhita
account,
-
I
didn't
mean
right
this
second.
I
spent
money
I
don't
have.
To
do
these
documents
Then
you
better
get
started.
Wow,
I
just
got
a
big
headache!
-
Was
I
hit
by
a
train
or
something?
I
forgot
to
tell
you.
I
hung
out
I
hope
she's
doing
your
brother
No,
no,
no.
You
got
more.
Yeah.
Anyway,
the
sooner
...the
sooner
you'll
be
partnerized.
-
I
taste
shit.
Stacy!
Did
you
put
shit
in
my
lunch?
I'm
gonna
get
going
now,
sir.
Stacy!
Have
you
considered
...of
the
thing
Yeah.
What
are
you
saying,
It's
your
life.
What
you
do
with
I
know,
so,
I
mean,
I
fast-forward
through
it,
Thirty
arguments
and
a
haircut?
Remember
the
leprechaun?
The
one
from
the
cereal
ad.
"They're
magically
delicious.
"
He's
always
chasing
the
pot
of
gold
But
when
he
gets
there
...it's
just
corn
flakes.
-
Michael.
-
You
don't
understand
the
metaphor?
-
Dad?
-
We
have
some
designs
for
you.
Maybe
they'll
help
you
All
right.
You
want
me
to
look
at
it?
The
ceiling's
too
high,
...stairway
placement
-
What
the
hell's
this
room
made
of?
Well,
it's
stupid.
Next.
-
Pickles.
Michael,
have
you
lost
your
mind?
If
he
wants
a
playroom
made
of
pizza,
Maybe
he's
gotta
grow
up
sometime
Hey,
pizza
boy.
It's
about
kissing
ass,
playing
it
safe,
...in
hopes
one
day
he
might
throw
you
Yes,
sir.
Ammer
didn't
make
you
partner,
Oh,
honey,
I'm
so
sorry.
But
we'll
get
through
this,
okay?
Jeez!
Man,
that's
all
we
ever
do
When
is
it
gonna
end?
Pretty
sweet,
eh?
Two
queen
beds,
full
kitchen,
...and
satellite
TV
Why
are
you
always
trying
to
hurt
me?
Michael
Newman,
And
now's
the
time.
No,
Kathy,
this
isn't
mine.
I
took
it
out
of
Kevin's
hands.
No,
I
wasn't!
I
think
I
smell
marijuana
in
it.
Kevin
O'Doyle,
you
get
your
ass
I
hate
you.
Are
you
deaf?
Move
it!
Dope
is
for
dopes,
buddy!
Get
your
ass
in
this
house!
We
don't
have
-
No
fair!
I
don't
wanna
return
my
bike!
-
But
Daddy
gave
them
to
us!
Unfortunately,
there
was
We
need
to
bring
But
I
already
told
Kevin
O'Doyle
Well,
we
can
paint
my
old
bike
That's
a
girl's
bike.
No!
I
wanna
keep
my
bike!
I
can't
take
this
anymore.
Fast-forward
me
to
my
promotion.
So
here's
to
Michael
Newman...
...the
greatest
partner
Hear,
hear!
Thank
you.
Thank
you,
guys.
I'm
gonna
do
the
best
I
can
Yeah!
-
Congratulations,
Mr.
Newman.
How's
it
feel,
killer?
-
Feels
incredible,
sir.
Not
just
because
of
that
For
helping
me
pick
up
the
slack
Hey,
Dinkie.
Are
you
kidding
me?
You
guys
have
That's
pretty
huge
for
this
one.
No,
the
first
few
months
were
easy.
It
was
the
one-year
hump
Her
inappropriate
weekend
...well,
that
was
But,
well,
Dr.
Bergman
helped
us
How's
he
doing
for
you
and
Donna?
Dr.
Bergman.
What
do
you
mean?
Oh,
you
know
what,
sweetie?
Let's
let
Michael
bask
in
his
glory.
Bask
away,
partner.
Took
that
bastard
What
else
did
I
miss?
-
Shit.
-
Who
are
you?
What
happened
to
Alice?
She
moved
to
Accounting.
And
she
prefers
to
be
called
Alan
now.
No.
No.
No!
And
who
the
hell's
And
I
feel
like
Michael's
making
No,
no.
I
want
to.
I
want
to.
"I'm
on
autopilot.
"
Good
one,
Donna.
-
"Good
one,
Donna"?
Who
is
this
bigmouth?
Why?
Because
there
is
no
talking
And
when
you
are,
you're
just
sitting
What
do
you
want
from
me?
This
is
what
happens.
What
the
heck
happened?
Great,
you
gonna
start
watching
TV
Oh,
can
we?
Samantha.
My
little
angel.
Look
how
long
your
hair's
getting.
When
did
you
grow
up?
Don't
worry.
Watch
Dragon
Tales
together.
Dragon
Tales
is
for
babies,
Dad.
Yeah,
CSI.
It's
the
episode
What
happened?
I
missed
Whoa,
hey,
hello.
What
are
you
doing?
Get
back
here,
Don't
yell
at
Peanut
because
Who's
Peanut?
Where's
Sundance?
Don't
mention
Sundance.
About
what?
Why?
He
died?
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Oh,
no.
The
stupid
idiot
and
soft
fur.
-
Daddy
held
it
in
so
long.
He's
finally
letting
himself
feel
it.
One
night
when
the
duck's
head
...he
tried
to
hump
my
leg
...and
I
should've
and
I'm
sorry.
-
What
an
idiot.
What
the
heck
did
I
do?
I
love
you.
Do
you
still
love
me?
Oh,
Michael.
It's
been...
I'm
really
confused.
No,
no,
no.
I'll
change,
okay?
Don't
go,
don't
go.
I'll
be
with
you.
Just
stay
with
me.
Oh,
my
God,
it
didn't
take
the
duck
It's
a
little
deviant,
Yeah,
well,
let's
kiss
and
make
up.
No.
No!
It's
not
my
fault.
It
jumped
on
its
own.
Not
even
close.
Yes?
-
You
scared-
It's
all
right!
I-
It's
dead!
But
it
broke
the
table
first!
-
How
did
you
get
in
here?
I'm
freaking
out.
It's
just-
It's
fast-forwarding
It's
not
a
malfunction,
it's
a
feature.
It's
using
its
memory
It
remembers
stuff?
It's
an
advanced
piece
of
equipment,
You
could
call
it
MeVo.
I
fast-forwarded
through
sex
one
time,
I
like
sex.
It
feels
good.
Correct
me
if
I'm
wrong,
but
you
That's
a
lot
of
sex.
Put
it
all
together,
Oh,
no,
no.
So
what,
-
...
it's
gonna
do
it
on
its
own
now?
No
more
showering,
no
more
traffic.
No
more
arguing.
This
is
bad,
this
is
bad.
You
take
it
back,
I
quit,
I
quit.
Thanks
for
everything,
Yeah.
You...
This
is
not...
Don't
be
mean.
Nice
hat.
No,
no,
no.
Get
away
from
me.
Just
get
away.
Is
this
a
stickup?
Yeah?
I'm
gonna
I
wouldn't
do
that
if
I
were
you.
There's
only
one
place
left
Oh.
No,
no,
I
don't
want
that.
I
told
you,
-
Come
on,
just
take
it.
Don't
do
that.
Come
on,
Morty.
Morning,
sweetie.
You
wanna
shower
first?
Yeah.
No!
I
can't
shower
And
if
I
fast-forward,
who
knows
How's
this?
I'm
gonna
rough
it
today,
Donna,
I
wanna
tell
you
...but
it
might
lead
to
an
argument.
So
just
know
there
is
a
problem.
I
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
problem,
I'm
gonna
go
to
work
You're
going
to
work
Honey.
We
can't
argue,
okay?
You're
right.
I'm
wrong.
All
the
time.
-
I'll
take
a
kiss.
...it
might
lead
to
something
else,
You're
laying
there
disappointed,
I
wanna
be
with
you
every
minute
Have
a
great
day!
Once
again,
Michael
left
Donna
Shut
up,
James
Earl
Jones!
No,
you
shut
up,
big
mouth!
Michael!
Mr.
Ammer
is
here
Your
first
day
as
a
partner,
you
come
I
did.
I
did.
John,
I
just
feel
we
should
...on
corporate
brown-nosing
and
Armani,
Calvin
Klein,
who
cares?
Let's
concentrate
That's
the
craziest
thing
But
goddamn
it,
you're
right.
Life-changing.
I
feel
freer.
Yeah-
Keep
the
pants
on.
Sexual
harassment,
eh?
Speaking
of
life-changing...
...there's
something,
or
actually
-
Janine.
Michael,
Janine
and
I
decided
...slow
down,
move
to
Morocco.
-
Morocco?
Okay.
Eric
Lamensoff
will
assume
...and
I'd
like
you
to
take
his
job.
But
Eric
Lamensoff
is
the
head
-
I've
been
your
partner
one
day.
Every
account
you
worked
on
You
know,
I
wouldn't
be
surprised...
...if
one
day
you
ended
up
Hey,
I
would
love
No!
No,
no,
no!
No!
Michael,
you
have
a
phone
call.
Michael
Newman.
Word
up,
big
guy.
Ten
years
ago
you
told
me
Great
news.
So
you
better
stop
with
the
junk
food,
...or
you'll
end
up
Opening
virtual
blinds.
Ten
years?
Oh,
my
God,
I'm
a
fat
guy!
Look
at
me.
What
is
this?
This
is
titties.
I
got
juicy
titties!
What-
What
is
that?
Oh,
God,
no.
Just
take
me
home.
This
is
1010
WINS
news.
Britney
Spears
Proud
father
Kevin
Federline
says
Also,
Michael
Jackson,
...is
now
suing
himself
Donna!
Donna!
Can
I
help
you?
-
Hey,
Dad.
Ben?
That's
you?
Look
how
big
you
got.
Look
who's
talking,
Captain
Twinkie
Really
good
for
my
self-esteem.
Maybe
if
you
would
take
me
...people
wouldn't
think
Come
on,
I
love
you!
-
Bring
me
back
the
Twinkies!
Will
you
please
stop
yelling?
-
Is
that
my
daughter?
That's
you,
Samantha?
The
same
time
you
did,
Dad.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
My
boyfriend,
the
hottest
boy
He's
gonna
be
hot
Get
your
ass
upstairs,
-
Why
are
you
so
mean
to
me?
-
And
wipe
off
all
that
makeup!
Is
Peanut
dead
too?
This
one's
got
the
duck
Donna.
Donna.
Goddamn
it.
Look
how
gorgeous
you
look.
-
Knock,
knock,
gang.
What's
going
on?
Donna
and
I
were
gonna
get
-
You
want
us
to
bring
you
one?
With
Johnny
G-String
over
here?
Come
on.
Time-out.
No,
no,
no,
we're
past
this
argument.
Hey,
it's
just
that
you
don't
Michael!
Stop
it!
Stop
it,
Michael!
It
was
your
decision
to
move
out!
Get
off
me!
Go
away!
Go
away,
I
hate
you!
-
We
can't
argue!
Donna,
please!
Oh,
man!
You
hate
me?
No.
No.
Ten
years,
you're
not
finished
yet?
Morty!
Why
did
you
do
this
to
me?
You
did
this
to
yourself,
Michael.
No.
No,
I
didn't
wanna
I
didn't
wanna
lose
Donna!
The
remote
goes
by
your
behavior.
Every
time
you
had
a
conflict
-
No,
not
true.
Lie
to
yourself.
The
remote
is
lie-proof,
so
you
can't
But
you're
still
a
young
man.
A
young,
fat
man.
So
that's
what
I'll
do.
Go
for
it,
tubs.
I
saw
what
you
did
to
the
duck.
You'll
feel
that
in
a
second.
All
right,
please,
-
hate
you!
I
hate
you!
I
hate
you!
Michael,
are
you
awake?
Michael,
honey.
Are
you
awake?
Donna.
Where'd
all
my
fat
go?
It
was
just
a
dream?
What's
that,
Michael?
Did
a
fuzzy
dog
push
me
over?
Oh,
Shaggy
the
miracle
dog?
Yeah,
if
he
hadn't
knocked
you
...you
wouldn't
have
had
the
CAT
scan
I
have
cancer?
No,
you
had
cancer.
You're
the
only
person
That's
probably
what
caused
Heart
attack?
I
thought
they
weaned
you
Okay,
Mr.
Junk
Food...
...since
the
injury,
When
exactly
did
I
hurt
my
head?
When
was
it?
Like,
six
years
ago?
Six
more
years!
No!
No!
I'm
gonna
ask
them
Donna,
don't
go.
What's
this?
That's
not
bad
One
more
tummy
tuck
Oh,
it
looks
like
a
tongue...
...licking.
Look,
I
should
go.
-
So
I'll
probably-
You're
still
with
Speedo
Torpedo?
Whatever
happened
"Forever
and
ever"?
Look,
Michael,
I'm
trying
to
have
...for
the
kids'
sake.
I
really
wanna
be
friends,
Would
you
stop
flapping
that
thing?
It's
my
flap,
I'll
do
You
done?
Look,
Bill's
my
husband.
Please
learn
to
accept
that.
Husband?
Donna?
No.
Donna.
Donna.
Donna!
Welcome
to
Newman
Architecture.
Building
a
better
world
for
all
of
us.
Architect
of
the
year,
2018.
All
your
dreams
came
true,
Dad.
Hey,
how
you
feeling?
-
Benjamin.
Look
at
that.
Your
face.
Your
skinny
face.
Your
entire
ass
is
gone.
Right,
my
ass.
Why
don't
My
old
office.
The
architect.
How
did
this
happen?
-
Mom
said
you
were
still
a
little
loopy.
The
weight.
How
did
you
do
it?
Wanna
have
a
flap
fight?
No.
Just
working
out
with
Bill
That's
a
looker.
Is
that
your
girl?
No,
that's
your
daughter
Samantha.
Of
course
it
is.
And
you
better
...and
make
sure
nobody
touches
her
Pop,
I'm
just
getting
ready
Okay.
Absolutely.
I'd
like
to
spend
more
time
together.
Take
you
out
for
ice
cream.
I
know
your
mother
won't
come...
...but
you,
Samantha,
That'd
be
nice,
huh?
I
knew
something
Papa,
take
a
seat.
What
are
we
sitting
for?
-
Here
you
go,
Pop,
drink
this.
There,
I
had
my
water.
Grandpa
died,
Dad.
He
died
a
while
back
now.
No,
no,
no.
Don't
say
that.
Where
was
I?
You're
crying?
What
happened?
Nothing.
You
know,
-
Shit.
Man,
I
gotta
go.
Hey,
hang
on.
No,
no,
do
your
meeting.
-
Why
are
you
crying?
-
You're
gonna
make
me
cry,
Dad.
You
look-
You
look
good.
It's
all
right.
Goodbye.
Come
on.
Come
on.
It
won't
take
you
there.
Take
me
where?
To
the
moment
he
died.
Of
course
I
wasn't.
Can
you
take
me
Hey,
Dad.
Sorry
to
bug
you.
Would
you
mind
looking
This
one
is
cheaper.
But
if
you
check
this
out...
...you'll
see
it
has
Cheaper
one,
like
I
said.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you're
right,
Dad.
He
ain't
right.
You're
a
schmuck!
Surprise.
Hey,
Grandpa.
Oh,
my
God.
When
did
you
get
so
handsome?
So,
Michael,
I
had
a
wonderful
idea.
Your
mother's
playing
canasta
I
thought,
You,
me
and
Ben
should
go
-
Can't.
You
have
to
eat
sometime.
We
could
go,
-
I'm
down
for
that.
I
don't
know
what
it
means,
-
Hey.
Please.
I'll
make
you
a
deal.
If
you
come,
I'll
show
you
-
Will
you
look
at
the
man?
No,
Dad.
Don't
you
wanna
know
how
I-?
I
know
how
you
do
the
stupid
trick.
Can
you
let
me
do
my
work?
You've
always
known.
You're
pathetic.
Okay.
I'm
so
sorry
I
barged
in.
I
love
you,
son.
See
you
later,
Grandpa,
I
love
you.
Dad.
Pop.
Pop.
I
love
you,
son.
I
love
you,
son.
I
love
you,
son.
I
love
you
too,
Dad.
I'll
miss
you.
You
know
that.
Goodbye.
I'm
sorry
about
your
father.
Taking
him
wasn't
something
What
do
you
mean
"taking
him"?
I'm
an
angel,
Michael.
An
angel?
I
thought
an
angel
was
I'm
the
angel
of
death.
Your
dad,
it
was
his
time.
You
bastard.
All
right,
leave
me
alone.
You
had
your
fun.
And
now,
everybody,
it's
time
Yay,
Michael!
Go
get
them,
Michael!
Speech!
Wedding
cake.
Wedding
cake.
Okay,
where's
the
groom?
Hi,
Dad.
Ben.
I
didn't
miss
Wow,
this
is
terrific,
buddy.
Very
funny,
Mr.
Newman.
Aunt
Peggy,
is
that
you?
God,
you
got
old.
No,
no.
I-
She-
I'm
just
playing.
Ma.
Ben's
wife...
...welcome
to
the
family.
Thank
you.
Congratulations.
Look
at
you,
Ma.
You
look
amazing.
Michael,
you
haven't
kissed
me
You
are
the
best,
Ma.
Oh,
darling,
that's
so
sweet.
You
know,
Michael,
your
father
I
know,
Ma.
Okay?
I'm
just
glad
you're
here.
Me
too,
bubbala.
Me
too.
Me
too.
Beautiful.
Look
at
her.
Donna,
my
favorite.
You're
such
a
schmuck
But
don't
let
me
ruin
your
evening.
Christina.
Michael,
you've
been
so
generous
...and
the
kids'
honeymoon.
-
Absolutely.
Of
course.
Ben's
wife
-
I
think
she's
wonderful.
Here's
one
you
might
remember
Out
of
all
the
songs,
huh?
Bill,
since
it's
our
son's
wedding...
...do
you
mind
if
I
dance
-
Not
at
all.
Just
have
her
back
by
midnight,
You
got
it,
Bill.
Why
does
he
have
Nice
Speedo,
buddy.
Still
smelling
good,
huh?
After
all
these
years.
Are
you
happy?
Of
course
I'm
happy,
Not
about
that.
Are
you
happy
"Ended.
"
It's
not
over
yet.
-
That's
my
Donna.
That
Samantha?
Hey.
What
are
you
doing?
What
is
with
you?
Just
kidding,
I...
Just
not
used
to
seeing
you
Okay,
well,
if
that's
your
way
of
telling
Let's
go
get
some
cake.
-
I'll
race
you
there,
Dad.
Come
on.
"Dad"?
Michael,
are
you
okay?
Is
there
a
doctor?
Michael!
-
Dad!
It's
just
corn
flakes.
One
dance,
you
pop
an
artery.
Why'd
you
make
me
You
were
fast-forwarding
...long
before
you
ever
met
me.
You
lived
the
life
you
chose,
This
is
not
the
life
I
wanted.
It
is.
Looks
like
it
is.
Hey.
You're
up.
How
you
feeling?
I
feel
better
Samantha's
been
here
She
said
she
wouldn't
leave
-
Why'd
you
do
that?
I
thought
Bill
was
your
father.
I
have
two
fathers.
One
of
them
told
me
he
was
gonna
You
both
really
need
And
I
got
a
plane
to
catch.
Big
Ben's
gotta
go
Actually,
I
just
canceled
Kensington
deal
might
fall
through,
-
Julie
and
I
can
go
to
Italy
anytime.
It's
not
that
big
a
deal.
-
That's
not
fair
to
your
wife.
...she
gets
it.
Keeping
Guys,
I'm
sorry.
You're
gonna
All
right.
Bye,
Dad.
Bye,
Daddy.
Get
this
off
of
me.
Whoa,
whoa!
Hey,
fella,
you're
a
long
way
I
gotta
see
my
son.
You're
not
going
anywhere.
-
Isn't
that
Colin
Farrell?
Michael.
Those
machines
I
gotta
talk
to
my
boy.
-
Michael,
stop.
Michael,
it
doesn't
have
to
end
now.
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Dad?

you
doing?
Are
you

but
I
love
you.
I

you.
Bill,

Bill.
I'm
sorry.
Michael.
The
note
you
wrote
her,
Forever
and
ever,
babe.
It's
time
to
go.
-
Where
am
I?
I
was
just
watching
you
sleep.
You
looked
like
you
were
having
What?
You're
not
supposed
to
lay
I'm
back
in
the
store?
I'm
young
again.
I'm
young
again.
Well,
I
mean,
I'm
young.
No,
no.
No.
I'm
just
teeing
off,
baby.
Look
at
you.
You
want
a
friend?
You
want
a
friend?
I'll
be
your
friend.
I'll
be
your-
Oh,
my
God!
Yes,
my
crappy
car!
You
mediocre,
middle-class
I
love
you!
Pop,
Pop.
Pop.
-
What's
wrong?
What
happened?
Everything's
incredible,
Ma.
-
I
love
you.
You
gotta
tell
me
how
you
do
A
magician
never
reveals
However,
if
you
invite
us
over
You
come
over
tomorrow
night,
and
-
Stop,
I'm
gonna
have
a
heart
attack.
Thank
you
so
much
for
giving
You
have
no
idea.
But,
honey,
please,
I
can't
promise
you
that.
Okay.
I'm
up.
What
do
you
think?
If
you
massage
me
first.
Okay,
let's
go
to
sleep.
Mom,
wake
up!
What
the
heck
is
going
on?
Hey,
do
you
mind?
Here
I
am,
staying
up
all
night...
...trying
to
come
up
with
activities
...but
you
won't
let
me
think!
You
want
time
to
think?
Why
don't
you
What
did
you
just
say?
Yes,
you
heard
me.
...I
won't
be
able
to
work
for
a
year
-
That
make
you
happy?
Give
me
those
big
lips.
-
What's
going
on
down
here?
Come
here.
Oh,
my
God.
I
missed
you,
I
missed
you.
I'm
gonna
finish
the
tree
house.
From
now
on,
we're
gonna
exercise
-
All
right!
And
you.
Nice
jump!
I
love
you.
One
day,
you
are
gonna
be
But
you
still
gotta
have
brains.
So
tomorrow
I'm
gonna
You
know
calculus?
I
knew
you'd
call
me
on
that.
Now,
get
your
rest,
because
tomorrow
I
know!
It's
gonna
be
the
best!
-
Put
a
sweater
on!
Don't
take
it
off!
Oh,
and
Sundance!
Doggie
years
go
by
very
quick,
Yeah,
go
get
some,
baby.
What
are
you
doing?
No.
Go
to
Sundance,
not
the
duck.
They
told
me
at
the
pet
store
They
lied
to
me,
I
guess.
-
You
staying
downstairs
tonight?
It's
Fourth
of
July,
Take
my
time,
massage
her,
But
you
know,
it
isn't
That's
even
better.
-
Think
I
like
this
holiday.
I'm
gonna
go
change
-
I'll
see
you
upstairs.
Okay,
I
gotta
call
my
dad

I
said,
I
know
you'll
do

Morty.
P.S.:
Your
wife's
rocking
body
Okay,
Morty.
Hey,
who
wants
