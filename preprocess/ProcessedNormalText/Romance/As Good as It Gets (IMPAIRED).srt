how

Yes.
No,

I

No.

forever.
And
have
they
done

on
him?

Okay,
and
how
about

we
should

me.

his

can
we

Mrs.
Connelly,
there's
still

here.
But
look,
whatever
I
find
out,
I
promise
you
at

is
gonna
feel

No...
Um,
fine.
That's
good.
So,
listen,
you
gotta
let
me

way
or
another
we'll...
Well,
the

are
gonna
be

don't
worry.

he

Uh,
would
there
be
any
way...
that
you
would
be
willing
Absolutely.
You're
a
wonderful
man.
2:00
would
be
a
good
time,

he
is
asleep.
Open
his
curtains
for
him...
so
he
can
see
God's
beautiful
work.

he'll
know
that...
even

like
this

did

teach
you

is
this
getaway

don't
send

back.
Right?

No,
I
do.
All
right,
listen.
No,
okay.
Bye-bye.

What
a
day.
Hey,
maybe
I'll
bring
him
some
food
by.
Thank
you
for
walking
him.

If
you'll
excuse
Yeah,
this
place
smells
like
shit.
Go
away.
What,
this,
uh...
Please,
just
leave!
What
happened
Get
outta
here!
Nothing
worse
than
having
to

you're
a
disgrace
to
depression.
Rot
in
hell,
Melvin.
No
need
to
stop
bein'
a
lady.
You'll
be
back
on
your
knees
in
no
time.

Whee-Whee-Whee.
Is
this
fun
for
you,
hmm?
Well,
you
lucky
devil,
it
just
keeps
I'm
losing
my
apartment,
Melvin,
to
beg
my
parents...
who
haven't
And
I-I
don't
want
to
paint
anymore.
So,
the
life
that
I
was
The
life
that
I
had
is
gone,
for
myself
that
it's
difficult
to
breathe.
It's
high
times
for
you,
The
gay
neighbor
is
terrified.

I
was
just
trying
to
give
you
a
boost.
Lucky
you,
you're
here
for
rock
bottom.
You
absolute
horror
of
a
human
being.

The
one
thing
I'll
do
for
you.
Get
out.
You
wanna
know
why
that
dog
prefers
me?
It's
not
affection.
I
keep
bacon
in
my
pocket.


Oh,
my
gosh.
We'll
both
call
him.
Okay?
Come
here,
Verdell.
Come
here.
-
Yo,
yo.

Come
here,
baby.
It's
okay.
Come
here.



Could
you
leave
now?
Please.
I
don't
get
it.



Taxi!



Again
with
Nick

one
begins
to
suspect
that
might
not
really


A
second
look
at
shows
-
Carol,
the
waitress?


Hi.
The
doctors
gave
me
your
billing
address.

If
you're,
uh...

Um,
if
you're,
That's
not
why
I'm
here.
Though
you
have
no
idea
what
it's
with
a
doctor
about
Spencer.
Uh,
note...
Put
it
in
a
note.

Uh...
Oh.
I
have
a
hair
dryer,
uh...
Why
did
you
do
this
for
me?
So
you'd
come
back
to
work
Do
have
some
idea
Well,
I
mean...
Are
you
waiting
for
me
to
say
something?
Look,
uh,
I'll
be
at
the
restaurant
tomorrow.
I
don't
think
this
can
wait
until
tomorrow.
Clear
what
up?
I'm
not
going
to
sleep
with
you.
I
will
never
sleep
with
you.
Not
ever.
Well.

we
don't
open
for
the
no-sex
I'm
not
kidding.
Anything
else?
Uh,
just...
thank
you.
So,
you'll
be
at
work
tomorrow?
Yes.


"Never,"
she
said.



I
took
a
chan...
Uh,
I
brought
you
some
Chinese
soup.
Uh,
thanks.

Boy.
I've
never
been
this
tired
in
my
life.
I
haven't
been
sleepin'.
I
haven't
been
clear
in
my
head...
or
felt
like
myself.
I'm
in
trouble.
It's
not
just
the
tiredness.
Boy.
It's
sick.
Sleepy.
Where
everything
looks
distorted,
and
everything
inside
and
you
can
barely
find
Yeah.
Oh.
I'm
glad
we
did
this.
Good
talking
to
you.

You
are
not
still
writing
I'm
on
the
last
page.

Look,
I
got
Sean
from
the
bakery
I
still
don't
feel
safe
-
Could
you
spell
it
again,
please?
You
better
start
finding
something
-
Sean,
are
you
hungry?

All
right.
Carol
and
I
are
going
out.
Sausage,
pepperoni.
You
wanna
make

Great.
If
you
can't
feel
good
about
this
break...
and
step
out
a
little,
then
I...
I
think
you
ought
to
have
Mr.
Udall
I
don't
need
one,
'cause
I
know
I
gotta
finish
this
letter,
-
Carol...
Carol?
What?

It's
very
weird
now,
not
feeling
that...
stupid
panic
thing
Without
that,
I
just
start
what
good
does
that
ever
get
anybody?

Today,
on
the
bus,
there
and
I
felt
myself...
giving
'em
a
dirty
look.
I
just
had
no
idea
everything
was...


Go
ahead.
Moving
in
the
wrong
direction...
away
from
a
time
when
I
to
have
a
man
to
anything.
Hold,
fucking...
Sorry...
No,
it's
okay.
Hands
with,
for
Christ
sake!
And...
I
felt
almost...
r-really
bad
that
Dr.
Bettes
is
married.

Which
is
probably
why
I
make
poor

The
poor
kid
doesn't
have
He
has
to
make
up

Who
needs
these
thoughts?
So,
what
are
you
saying?
Leave
me
be!

Why
are
you
doing
this?
I
hope
getting
me
thinking
when
all
I
want
to
do
is
Really,
Mom,
what
is
it
you
want?
What?
I
want
us
to
go
out.
Okay.

Like
spiral
curls
and
barrel

I
gotta
go,
Jimbo.
I'll
see
ya.

Because
I
love
you.

You
know,
it's
got
those
big

Yeah,
I
don't

Thank
you.
Now,
I
gotta

Oh,
look,
Evelyn's
here,

That's
why
you
brought
me
here.
Well,
you
know,
it's
not
even
mine.
And
this
guy
Simon
seems
But
the
dog
did
throw
up
twice
Well,
take
him
to
the
vet.
They
say
his
stomach's
out
of
whack
and
Well,
do
it.

Sorry.
Okay.
-
What's
this?
-
A
note?
Thank-you
note?
-
You
can
read
it
later.
No.
No,
thank
you.
No.
Thank
you.
She's
nice.
Yeah.
Really
nice.
Shouldn't
that
be
a
good
thing,
telling
-
Yeah.
Sure
looks
like
it
went
over
too.
I
mean...
look
at
you!
You're
sure
making
the
rounds.

-
What?
You
helped
with
the
dog.
Hey,
I'm
as
concerned
Concerned?
He's
gotta
get
to
Baltimore
to
ask
Yeah,
well,
yeah.
I
mean,
if
his
parents
are
alive,
Good.
That's
great.
Let
them
help
him.
Only,
uh,
I
got
a
high-maintenance
selling
Can
you
drive
him?
Think
white
and
get
serious.
Take
my
car,
a
convertible?

Like
the
wind.
Gettin'
loud,
gettin'
loud.
He
wants
me
to
take
his
car
I
want
your
life
for
one
minute,
where
my
big
problem
is
somebody
so
I
can
get
out
of
this
city.


Okay,
I'll
do
it.
Yeah,
get
him
ready,
packed.
Tomorrow
morning,
I'll
take
him.
Okay.

All
right,
I'll
see
you
tomorrow.
We
don't
enjoy
one
another
that
much.
If
there
is
some
mental
health
for
people
like
you,
Last-word
freak.
Bye-bye.

Is
he
talking
to
me?
Yeah.
I'm
gonna
give
my
queer
neighbor
Okay.
Hey.
What
I
did
for
you...
What
you
did
changed
my
life.
No,
uh...
Uh,
no
thank-you
note.
Well,
part
of
what
I
said
which
you
won't
read,
is
that
somehow...
you
have
done
more
for
my
mother,
my
I'm
just
gonna
read
you
this
part
of
it.
"And
that
makes
you
the
most
"generous
person
I
ever
met
in
my
life,
"and
that
you're
gonna
be
in
our
prayers,
our
daily
prayers,
forever."

I...
I
also
wrote
one
part...
I
wrote,
"I'm
sorry."
I
was
talking
about
I
was
sorry
when
you
came
over,
and
you
told
So,
I
wrote
that
I
was
sorry
I
wrote
I
was
sorry
for
bustin'
for
bustin'
in
on
you
that
I
was
sorry.
And
I'm
sorry
for
and
that
you
had
to
wait
And
I'm
sorry
for
never
spotting
right
the
human
being
that
had
it
in
I'll
just...
You
know
what,

Gee...
"to
express
my
gratefulness
to
you.
Even
as
I
look
at
the
word
'grateful'
now,
Uh,
that's...
I
see
it.
Thank
you.

Now,
I
want
you
to
do
something
for
me.
I'm
sorry,
I
thought
I
said,
"What?"
What?
I
want
you
to
go
on
this
trip.

I
can't
do
this
without
you.
I'm
afraid
he
might
pull
I
need
you
to
chaperone.
You
said
you
liked
convertibles.
-
I'm
sorry,
"the
stiff
one-eye"?
I
can't.
I
work.
My
son.
-
Melvin,
I'd
rather
not.
-
Funny,
I
thought
it
was
a
strong
point.
I
need
a
hand,
and
where'd
she
go?
Are
you
saying
accepting
Is
there
any
other
way
to
see
it?
No.
Here's
a
little
suitcase...
shocked
that
it's
being
used.


There's
no
way
to
pack
for
this
trip.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

Woo-woo.


Hello?
You're
still
comin',
aren't
you?
Melvin,
I
would
like
to
know
Um,
just
south
of
Baltimore,
Maryland,
and,
uh,
I
know
what
I
mean,
I
think
I
know.
I'm
not...
I'm
not
sure,
but
I
think
so.
There's
no
need
for
me
I
mean,
I
didn't
know
in
any
restaurants
that
have
dress
codes?
Well,
I,
uh...
I
mean,
maybe,
uh...
I
mean,
yes!
Let's.

What
did
you
think
I
was
gonna
ask?
Whether
crabs
were
in
season
there
now.
Oh,
okay,
then.
Good
night.

No.
Certainly.
Okay,
put
him
in
with
that
one,
Builds
his
confidence,
huh?
Lip
kiss.
Ah!
I
love
you.
Hey!
Bye.
Call
me
when
you
get
settled.

Don't
worry,
Mom!
No,
don't...

do,
do
you
know
You
know
who
you
want.
I
would
take
your
seat
any
day.
So,
so,
do
something
about
it!
Go
over
there,
now,
tonight!
I
mean,
it's
not
always
good
You
can
do
this,
Melvin.
You
can.
Pull
the
stops.
Hey,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm
charged
here.
Yes,
you
are!
Well,
then
get
in
your
jammies
I
really
think
you
have
a
chance
here.
The
best
thing
you
have
going
for
you
is
So,
go
over
there.
Do
this.
Okay.
Thanks
a
lot.
Here
I
go.
What's
wrong?
-
I
forgot
to
lock
the
door.



-
What
do
you
want,
Melvin?
I
wasn't
asleep.
What
a
break.
Is
it
a
secret
what
you're
doing
here?

Because?

It
relaxes
me.
I'd
feel
better
sitting
outside
than
any
other
place
No,
no,
wait.
I'd
rather
be
sitting
'cause
I
don't
wanna
get
What
would
that
serve?
Why
can't
I
just
have
a
normal
boyfriend?
Just
a
regular
boyfriend
Everybody
wants
that,
dear.
Uh...
Oh,
I'm,
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
Boyfriend.
Come
on
in,
and
try
not
to
Maybe
we
could
live
Maybe
we
could.
It
feels
a
little
confined
in
here.
See,
it's
4:00
in
the
morning.
if
you
don't
mind.
Well,
if
you
need
an
excuse,
uh,
there's
a
bakery
on
the
corner.
We
got
a
good
shot
it'll
be
open
soon.
Just...
two
people
that
like
warm
rolls.
Okay.
