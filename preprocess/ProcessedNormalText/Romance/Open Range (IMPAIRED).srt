Can't

Not

Button.
Then

Looks

pause
Too
big
to

Afraid
I'd

too
much.
It
was
Charley

I
ain't

You

Anyway,

It'll

Could

Mose!
Ow!

You'll

When
you
want
me
to

Tonight.
BUTTON:
I

How
long

figure,
Charley?
Without
cows
slowing
things,
Sounds
about
right.
Come

Boss.
I
can
do
it.
Sure
you

Starting

Get

a
bed
up
off
the
ground,
and
food

further
away
Ain't

so,
Charley?
That
was
a
big
help.
Might
as
well
be
talking
Put
your
boot
on,
Button.
Course,
if
you
was
to
lie
You'd
hae
to
clean
up
some.
Otherwise,
no
one
What
you
do
that
for?!
Cheating
at
cards.
Cheating.
I
apologized
to
you
for
that!
Eh,
Boss?
Eidently
he
ain't
oer

yet.
It's
getting
dark,
Boss.
He

got
hurt
Probably
just
taking
his
time.
Don't
suppose
he
got
into
Wouldn't
gamble
What
if
he's
lying
out
there
We'd

He's

Most

But

sets
of
eyes,

Maybe

a
liar.
You

I

plenty.
Inciting
a

Creating
a
public
nuisance.
Hear

fine.
Well,
I

One
night,
the

Shot

Charley,
I'm
glad

Let's
clean
up
these
cuts
He's
got
a
nice
gash
I'd

We'll

Well,
he'll

Ma'am.
BOSS:
Doc
Barlow's

did
you?
Well,
I

Glad

Sweet,

Goddamn

Button's
all
right,
Boss.
Anyone
done

Here
he
is.
If
you're
awake,

Where
you
been?!
BUTTON:
I
thought
I
told
you
-
What
happened
to
Mose?
Yeah,
but
what
happened?
Run
into
a
little
trouble
Looks
like
more
than
a
little.
Are
we
moing

We
always

don't
we,
Did
I
do
something
wrong?
Just
leae

a
while.
Here.
Made
fresh,
for
a
change.
There

it
happens.
Don't
make
no
sense,
him
telling
Weren't

Most

will
tell
you
if
you
listen,
A
few
years
back,
a
free-graze
That
weren't
no
idle
story.

years.
Mm-hmm.
You

call
that,
Long
time.
Been
a
lot
of
change
since
then.
What's
on
your
mind,
Boss?
Way
I
figure
it,
we
can
leae
or
you
and
me
can
go
in
the
dark
before
they
scatter
the
herd.
You
reckon

are
worth
The
cows

one
thing.
But

out.
Got

You'll
want
to

that
fire.
Button,
keep
to
the
wagon.
I
don't
want
to
see
you
Okay?
I
got
some
sugar
in
that
town.
It's
in
the
wagon.
I

You're

Him
going

I

A
whack
on
the
head
for
the
rest
of
his
days.
Well,
you
done
all
you
can.
He
needs
a
doctor
now.
If
Button
lies
through
morning,
you
take
him
in
the
wagon
You
just
gonna
sit
out
here
That's
right.
And
I'm
gonna
kill
that
comes
to
take
them.
For
one

But
he

and
I

to
take
him.
If
you
want
to

Otherwise,
you

what
you
You

they'll
let
you

Looks
real
nice,
Charley.
Yeah,
a
man
ought
to
hae
Be
gone
in
another
big
storm.
Don't
matter
none.
He'd
like
it
you
put
Yeah,
he
was
more
than
he
was
mine.
Be
right
to
say
some
words.
You
want
to
speak
I'll
stand
right
here
but
I
ain't
talking
And
I'll
be
holding
a
grudge
for
him
letting
this
befall
Well,
he
sure
as
hell
Woke
with
a
smile.
Seemed
like
he
could
keep
it
Kind
of
man
that'd
say
whether
it
was
or
not.
To
tell
you
the
truth,
Lord,
I
neer
seen
them.
Seemed
like
old
Tig
wouldn't
Well,
you
got
yourself
and
I'm
inclined
to
agree
about
holding
a
grudge
I
guess
that
means
"amen."
God.
BOSS:
I'm
fine.
Seems
like
you
was,
you
know...
I
said
I'm
fine.
Just
got
some
old
feelings
You
know,
we
neer
asked
That's
always
been
okay
with
me.
But
you
said
some
things
Things
that
seemed
like
they
had
Hey,
Charley?
Don't
stand
behind
me,
Boss.
When
I
was
a
kid,
a
bunch
of
us
with
our
peashooters.
Nothing
fancy,
just
enough
maybe
something
larger
Killed
my
first
man
Held
the
paper
on
our
farm,
he'd
come
around
to
get
payment
Weren't
much
older
than
Button
Knew
there'd
be
more
killing,
so
War
was
on.
They
was
only
too
happy
My
first
skirmish
was
like
We
just
sat
up
in
some
trees,
Must
hae
been
a
hundred
of
them
Went
around
and
shot
the
rest
Those
of
us
with
the
knack
so
we
could
trael
light
into
enemy
territory.
Orders
were
pretty
simple.
With
room
like
that,
it
wasn't
that
weren't
een
in
uniform.
Seemed
like
that
went
on
After
that,
I
come
West.
Lot
of
call
for
a
man
And
I
put
them
to
work
Eery
once
in
a
while,
without
thinking
He
drifted
off
again.
No
better,
but
no
worse,
either.
You're
a
real
honest
man,
Well,
I
ain't
gonna
lie
Not
Button
I'm
talking
about.
-
Mr.
Spearman.
No,
he's
not
here.
We
got
a
boy
that's
hurt
bad.
Here,
put
him
It's
not
his
hearing,
ma'am.
He
hears
real
well
Mr.
Spearman,
I'm
checking
It
could
mean
a
fractured
skull.
Are
you
the
boy's
father?
No,
ma'am.
His
