What
should
I
do
with
this,
Your
Excellency?
Yes.
I
picked
it
out
for
Daria
Alexandrovna

Bonjour,

Lili.
Bonjour.
Bonjour,

Grisha.
Bonjour.
Vasya.
Who
is
coming
to
see

Grand-maman?
CHILDREN:
Me!
Me!
Me!
Come
along,
my
little
ducklings.
-

Be
good
today.
I'm
off.

Read
the
chapter
carefully.
I'll
come
back
to
test
you
on
it.
Read
it
twice.

Au
revoir.



Oh,
Stiva.

Aunt
Dolly
found
a
note
from
the
governess.
Well?
Stiva
wants
me
to
come
to
Moscow
I'm
to
be
deprived
of
my
wife

I
can't
excuse
him
Oh,
it's
for
Dolly's
sake,
too.
Four
committees
today.
I
have
the
world
waiting
for
me.
There's
never
time
to
look
at
your
exercises.
Serozha
is
doing
very
well,
Your
Excellency.
Who
put
this
shirt
on
you?
Well,
never
mind.
I'll
come
and
hear
you
read.
KARENIN:
Tomorrow,
perhaps.
Thank
you,
Lukich.
Perhaps
tomorrow.
No.
No,
no,
not
tomorrow.
LUKICH:
Thank
you,
Your
Excellency.
Come
along.
Alexei,
do
you
think
should
count
for
nothing
No.
Very
well.
But
sin
has
a
price,
you
may
be
sure
of
that.

But
why?
ANNA:
Because
that's
where
Aunt
Dolly
lives.
-But
why?
She's
not
well.
I
must
go
to
see
her.
But
why,
Mama?
Don't
make
Mama
cry.
I'll
be
back
before
you
know,
I
don't
want
a
present.
I
want
you
to
stay.
Oh,
my
little

Kotik.
What
present?
That's
better.


It's
the
first
time
I've
left
my
little
boy.
So,
you're
leaving
your
son
I'm
Countess
Vronskaya.
I've
been
in
St.
Petersburg
My
eldest
son
married
Princess
Chirkov.
You're
a
charming
creature.
I've
never
been
in
Moscow
society,
really.
But
you
know
my
name.
-I've
heard
you
mentioned.

Ah,
love.
-Was
it
love?
My
sons
are
ashamed
of
me.
But
I'd
rather
end
up
Wouldn't
you?
I
don't
know.
Some
man
came
Waiting
outside.
Levin!
Where
did
you
disappear?
I'm
very
anxious
to
see
you.
I
need
your
advice.
Well,
come
into
my
room,
then.
This
is
my
oldest
friend,
Someone
send
word
I'll
be
a
few
minutes
late.
That's
my
office,
up
there.
Oh,
I've
been
hard
at
it.
Sit
down.
Hard
at
what,
exactly?
Well,
we're
overwhelmed
with
work.
Paperwork.
Paperwork
is
the
soul
of
Russia.
Now,
when
am
I
going
to

Look
at
you,
in
Western
clothes
Something's
up.
Yes,
I'm
in
love.
I've
come
back
to
propose.
Have
you
guessed
who
she
is?
I...
I
have
a
suspicion.
I
decided
it
was
impossible.
Kitty
is
of
the
heavens,
an
angel.
But
then,
I
thought
and
thought,
-Do
I
have
a
chance?
The
Shcherbatskys
Get
there
early,
before
the
crowd.
-And
if
I
may
suggest...
-New
boots.
We'd
better
have
dinner
together.
Come
on.
We'll
meet
later
at
l'Angleterre.
Or
do
you
prefer
the
Hermitage?
Let's
say,
5:30
at
l'Angleterre.
I
owe
them
more
than
the
Hermitage,
so
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
withdraw
my
custom.
Uh,
so,
new
boots,
coat,
and
a
proper
hat.
-

Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Do
you...
Do
you...
Excuse
me.
It's
so
unfair.
You
marry
for
love.
You're
a
good
husband.
Children
arrive,
years
depart.
And
all
of
a
sudden,
And
her
hair
is
thin.
And
her
body...
And
you
yourself,
you
still
have
your
vigor!
And
then
you
find
yourself
Forgive
me,
but
I
find
that
incomprehensible.
As
though,
I
should
leave
this
restaurant
Well,
you
know,
a
freshly
baked
roll.
I'm
talking
about
love,
Easily
confused.
Who?
No.
Why?
He's
your
rival.
Who
is
he?
Oh,
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
him.
He's
a
rich,
good-looking
cavalry
officer
who
has
nothing
better
to
do
Is
that
cabbage
soup?
Potage
aux
choux
Ã 
la
russe,
-
Understand
that,
for
me,
Kostya...
Kostya,
Kitty
would
be
mad
to
refuse
you.
And
Dolly's
on
your
side,
you
know?
She
says
her
sister
Kitty
Dolly
said
that?
I've
always
thought
your
Dolly
was
a
gem.
She
is.
She
is.
I
loved
her
to
distraction.
KITTY:
Konstantin!
Konstantin!

Konstantin!
I'm
too
early.
I'll
come
back.
No.
Come
up.
Look
at
me.
I'm
receiving
for

Papa

and

Maman,
It's
my
first
reception.
Princess
Ekaterina.
Delighted.
Delighted.
I'm
so
pleased
you
were
able
to
be
with
us,
Kitty,
you
look...
-You
look...
How
long
are
you
staying?
I
don't
know.
It
depends
on
you.
On
me?

What
I
mean
to
say
is
I...
I
only
came
with
one
purpose.
I
want
to...
Will
you
be
my
wife?
-
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
Wrong
moment.
It's
the
wrong
moment.
But
will
you?
I
can't.
I'm
sorry.
Yes.
It
was
impossible.
I'm
sorry.
Are
you
the
brother
of
Nikolai
Levin?
Yes.
He's
in
Moscow.
How
do
you
know?
It's
the
sort
of
thing
I
know.
Count
Vronsky?
Yes?

Princess
Kitty.
It's
been
so
long,

It
was
yesterday.

Excuse
me.
No.
Sorry.

It's
Kostya.
Good
God!
Look
at
him.
You
look
like
a
capitalist.
What
do
you
want?
Nothing.
I
came
to
see
you.
Good
evening,
miss...
Madam.
Don't
talk
to
her
like
that.

More
vodka
for
my
brother!
Quick
about
it.
I
don't
want
anything.
I'm
all
right.
Who
told
you
where
to
find
me?
A
colonel
in
the
Third
Department.
Good.
They
must
think
I'm
dangerous.
What
have
you
got
to
smile
about?
Nothing.
That's
right.
The
day
is
coming.
You're
on
the
wrong
side
of
history.
Not
because
privilege
is
immoral.

But
because
it's
irrational.

He's
sick!
Let
go,
if
you
know
what's
good
for
you.
I
took
Marya
Nikolaevna
from
a
brothel.

But
I
consider
her
my
wife.
If
her
presence
offends,
you're
free
to
leave.
Are
you
married?
No.
Why
not?
Are
you
waiting
to
fall
in
love?
-No.
Romantic
love
will
be

You
should
marry
one
of
your
peasants.
Yes.
I
damn
well
should.
The
brotherhood
of
man!

Nikolai,
you
need
to
see
a
doctor.
Then
come
and
stay
with
me
at
Pokrovskoe
With
my
wife?
If
you...
Or...
Or
go
abroad
to
a
spa.
I'll
send
more
if
that's
what
you
want.
Hello,
what's
this?
Austrian
royalty
on
their
honeymoon.
The
private
carriage
will
Bad
luck.
What
do
they
like,
art?
Food.
Here's
the
train.
Oh.
I'll
come
back.
Stiva!
Anna!

-You
don't
look
ashamed!
Yes,
of
course.
Oblonsky's
sister,
Karenina.
Charmante,

don't
you
think?


There,
Countess.
You
have
found
your
son,
Madam
Karenina
has
a
son,
too.
It's
the
first
time
they've
been
apart,
Excuse
me
for
not
recognizing
you
before.
-Au
revoir,

Countess.
Let
me
kiss
that
pretty
face.


Keep
your
people
inside

The
sole
supporter
of
a
large
family,
they
say.
Well,
can't
anything
be
done
for
them?
Wait
for
me,

Maman.
VRONSKY:
Stand
back.
I
have
you
to
thank
for
that.
OBLONSKY:
Oh!
Oh,
what
a
good
fellow!
What
a
good
fellow.
ANNA:

Have
you
known
Count
Vronsky
long?
Did
you
like
him?
He's
in
love
with
Kitty.
Oh.
But
we
should
be
discussing
you
and
Dolly.
What
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself?
I've
said
it
all.
On
my
knees,
in
tears.
Now
I
need
you
to
say
it.
I'm
going
to
the
office,
Don't
be
late
home.

Oh,
dear.
Kitty's
coming
by
to
see
you.
She's
all
grown
up
The
belle
of
St.
Petersburg
society.

Is
that
who
I
am?
Dolly.
Stiva
has
told
me.

Oh,
Dolly,
I'm
sorry.
From
the
bottom
of
my
heart.
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
I
know.
I
know.
I
can't
bear
to
be
with
him.
And
he
doesn't
care.
He's
got
what
he
wants.
What
he
wants
is
you.
He
loves
you,
Dolly.
You
and
the
children
are
everything
to
him.
Are
we?
And
there
is
room
for
a
governess?
That
was
shameful,
It
was
the
animal
in
man,
not
the
soul.
Stiva's
remorse
is
from
the
soul.
Well,
what
about
me?
Does
his
remorse
make
it
easier
for
me?
I
know
you
are
suffering.
Is
there
enough
love
left
in
your
heart?
Well,
when
I
think
of
them
together,
No.
My
poor
lamb.
My
fate?
But
I
haven't
done
anything!
Do
you
love
him,
Dolly?

You
love
him,
and
he
loves
you.
But
you
can't
forgive.
So,
your
lives
must
continue
like
this
Oh,
that's
pretty.
Is
that
a
wedding
dress?
Yes.
Look
for
the
"G"
for
"Grisha."
-Here.
Can
you
do
your
whole
name?
Doesn't
that
look
like
a
princess?
No?

OBLONSKY:
I'm
home!
Home,
home,
home!
Now,
where
are
my
little
ducklings?
CHILDREN:
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Will
you
stay
Oh.
I
always
feel
dull
at
a
ball.
-Ah!
Stiva,
tell
Anna
she
must
come
to
the
ball.
Well,
of
course
she
must.
And
God
go
with
you.
You
can
introduce
me
to
your
new
governess.
But
she's
old!
She's
a
hundred!

I
know
why
you
want
me
to
come.
You
want
everyone
to
be
there
because
you're
quite
sure

How
did
you
know?
I
know
everything.

Oh,
to
be
your
age
again.
Surrounded
by
that...
That
blue
mist.
I
was
18,
too,
when
I
got
married.
Is
the
prince
at
home?
SERVANT:
He's
just
gone
up,
I
believe.
Is
nobody
receiving?
I
can
enquire,
sir.
I
don't
think
so.
The
princess
retired
early.

No.
Thank
you.

We
thought
you
would
come
back
married.
Did
you?
But
you
only
came
back
with
a
hat.
A
black
silk
hat.
What
kind
of
animal

It's
not
natural.
Next
time,
perhaps.
There'll
be
no
next
time.

Kitty.
May
I
have
a
waltz?
You
may,
Boris.
I'll
save
you
the
third,
You're
my
first
conquest!

Where
do
you
want
to
be
taken?
There.
-
How
are
you,
Stiva?
Thanks
to
Anna,
I
am
a
happy
man.
No.
Ask
Anna.
No,
I
don't...
-Come
on,
then.
This
vile,
idiotic
matchmaking
of
yours.
For
goodness'
sake,
what
have
I
done?
Is
anything
the
matter?
No.
You
look
as
lovely
as
ever,
Princess
Kitty.
Don't
ask
me,

Maman.
Kitty,
it's
us
next.
Princess,
I
have
the
honor
to
claim
my
dance.
He'll
dance
the
mazurka
with
Kitty.
You'll
see.

OBLONSKY:
I
am!
I
really
am!

Dance
with
me.
I'm
not
used
to
being
spoken
to
like
that
by
a
man
I
met
once
at
a
railway
station.
I
dare
say,
but
if
I'm
not
to
dance
with
you,
then
I'm
getting
out
of
this
operetta
Then,
for
Kitty's
sake.

That's
my
sister.

GUARD:
Next
stop
is
Bologoye!


Can
I
be
of
service
to
you?
Why
are
you
leaving
Moscow?
What
else
can
I
do?
I
have
to
be
where
you
are.
Stop,
that's
enough.
Go
back
to
Kitty.
No.
This
is
wrong.
It
makes
no
difference.
You
have
no
right.
It
makes
no
difference.
You
must
forget
me.
If
you're
a
good
man,
you'll
forget
everything.
-And
you?
Will
you
forget?
Yes.

Is
Serozha
all
right?
Oh,
is
that
all
I
get?
Yes,
he's
quite
well.
Were
you
a
success?
I?
Oh,
Dolly
and
Stiva.
Yes,
I
think
so.
-I'll
announce
myself.
Vronsky.
The
master
himself.
Baroness,
coffee
from
I'll
be
off
home
if
I'm
in
the
way.
You're
at
home
where
you
are,
Baroness.
Oh!
Oh,
Pierre,
you
never
say
We
were
just
discussing
my
husband.
He
won't
divorce
me,
you
see,
-No.
I
want
to
bring
an
action.
Just
because
I'm
supposed
to
be
unfaithful,
I
don't
see
why
I
have
to
Look
at
it!
It's
my
crockery.
Oh!
PETRITSKY:
How
was
Moscow?
Provincial.
Thank
you
for
my
presents.

I'm
writing
to
Dolly
and
to
Kitty.
You
are
good.
Time
for
bed.

What
are
they
saying
in
Moscow
What
new
statute?
The
new
statute
I
carried
in
Council.
No
one
mentioned
it.
Really?
Oh.
Here,
it
caused
quite
a
sensation.


Princess
Betsy.
Cousin.
I
didn't
know
you
were
an
art
lover.
I'm
prepared
to
be
one.

Countess
Lydia
tells
me
you
haven't
been
to
The
last
one
was
to
meet
a
missionary.
The
one
before
that
was
for
a
lecture
on

Oh,
I'm
sorry.
I
know
you're
fond
of
her.
Come
on,
or
we'll
be
late.

Here's
the
thing,
Vronsky.
A
posting's
come
up,
Thank
you,
sir.
In
the
garrison
in
Tashkent.
Tashkent?
But...
I
would
like
to
stay
in
Peter,
sir,
Well,
I
don't
mind.
But
your
mother...
It's
her
idea.

Your
husband
is
a
saint,
and
we
must
all
cherish
him
You
didn't
come
to
my
dinner.
I
had
to
see
my
Commanding
Officer.
Well,
"she"
didn't
come
either.
I
do
hope
you
can
come
on
afterwards.
Father
Kristof's
report
on
the
Chinese
I'm
expected
at
the
Tverskoys'.
No
doubt.
But
I'm
sure
that

Yes,
in
fact,
I
don't
think
I
will
go
to
Betsy's.
You're
caught.
I'm
afraid
I'm
becoming
quite
ridiculous.


Now,
there's
a
phenomenon.
Look,
Anna's
shadow
I'm
Anna's
friend.
But
all
this
making
up
is
not
polite
to
In
my
opinion,
And
we
all
love
you
for
your

Alexei,
you
look
desperate.
It's
not
attractive.
I'm
losing
hope.
Hope
of
what?
Persuading
a
virtuous
woman

No,
you're
right.
She
won't
come.

He's
gone.
But
you're
just
in
time
for
the
surprise.


Turn
around!
VRONSKY:
May
I
have
the
honor

Ices
are
being
served.
I
would
prefer
to
try
a
cigarette.

Courage.
I'll
try
another
one
sometime.
When?
Where?
Just
as
I
was
thinking
You
behaved
badly.
Very
badly.
And
who
was
responsible
for
that?
Give
me
a
cup
of
tea.
How
nice!
Alexei
Alexandrovich
has
arrived.

I'm
not
sure
my
nerves

Were
you
glad
to
see
me
or
not?
So
the
Schuzburgs
asked
us
to
dinner.
The
sauce
was
said
to
have
I
gave
them
a
sauce

This
must
stop.
You
make
me
feel
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
I
want
you
to
go
to
Moscow
No,
that's
not
what
you
want.
Moscow?
I
can
do
better
than
that.
Tonight
I
refused
a
posting
to
Tashkent.
I
can
change
my
mind,
If
you
have
any
thought
for
me,
I
have
no
peace
to
give.
There
can
be
no
peace
for
us.
Only
misery
or
the
greatest
happiness.
-BETSY:
Your
husband
is
impossible.
His
opinions
are
all
wrong,
but
he
talks
so
brilliantly,
-
I
called
to
take
you
home.
No,
I'm
staying.
Send
the
carriage
back
for
me.
Of
course.


Do
you
want
me
to
go
to
Tashkent?
So
I'll
go
to
Tashkent.
No!
I
don't
want
you
to
go.
KARENIN:
I
stayed
up
to
talk
to
you.
What
about?
It's
late.
Where's
Annushka?
I
sent
her
off.
Well.
If
you
want
to
talk,
but
we
should
go
to
bed.
I
must
warn
you
about
something.
Warn
me?
Oh,
it's
really
rather
late.
I
wish
to
warn
you
that
you
may,
inadvertently
by
indiscretion
and
carelessness,
give
the
world
occasion
to
talk
about
you.
I
am
not
a
committee.
Please
say
what
you
want
to
tell
me.
You
and
Count
Vronsky
You
don't
like
it
when
I
don't
talk
to
people,
and
you
don't
like
it
when
I
do.
I
didn't
notice
anything
myself,
but
I
saw
everyone
else
noticed.
I
consider
jealousy
I
have
no
right
to
inquire
into
your
feelings.
They
concern
only
your
conscience.
But
it's
my
duty
to
remind
you
and
this
bond
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
And
you
have
a
son.
And
I'm
tired.
If
I
am
wrong,
I
ask
your
pardon.
I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about,
and
it's
really
too
late
for
this.
Excuse
me,
please.

Too
late.


Oh,
God!
Oh,
forgive
me!
It's
the
end
of
everything.
I've
got
nothing
left
now
except
you,
How
could
I
not
remember?
You're
my
happiness.
Happiness?
You
murdered
my
happiness.
Murderer.
Murderer.

Go
on.
Yes.
Go
on.
Murderer.
Murderer.
OBLONSKY:
Look
out,
here
they
come.
Oh,
bad
luck.

Potage
aux
choux
Ã 
la
russe!
OBLONSKY:
Agafia,
the
l'Angleterre
would
go
out
of
business.

It's
true.
-OBLONSKY:
Do
you
want
news
of
Moscow?
Oh,
you're
right,
what
do
you
care?
You
love
the
country,
you've
got
it.
You
love
agriculturing,
You
love
shooting,
you've
got
that.
-You've
got
everything
you
want.
All
right,
go
on,
then.
Have
you
stopped
stealing
bread
rolls?
Ballet
girl,
Oriental
type.
How
can
I
help
it?
How
is...
How
are
the
Shcherbatskys?
You
mean
Kitty.
-Is
she
engaged
now?
Vronsky
went
back
to
St.
Petersburg.
Huh.
Kitty
will
be
seeing
You
could...
Oh,
yes,
as
if
I
had
time
in
the
summer.
And
I've
got
extra
land
Kashin?
That's
on
the
Couldn't
you
see
Kitty
when
she's
there?
Especially,
not
then.
I
humiliated
myself
once.
Oh,
damn
you,
Kostya.
You
love
Kitty.
You
love
Kitty
and
you
can't
forgive
her
because,
first,
you
funked
it,
And
then
you
ran
away
who
was
made
a
fool
of
by
a
uniform.
It's
not
you
I
feel
sorry
for,
it's
Kitty.
Her
heart
told
her
no.

Did
you
come
to
shoot
snipe
or
criticize
me?


Well,
don't
hold
him
like
a
parcel.
Oh!
It's
Aunt
Kitty,
darling.

Doesn't
he
make
you
ashamed
I
have
no
troubles.
That
man
wasn't
worth
the
tears,
believe
me.
I
don't
care
about
him.
Except
to
hate
her.
Then
we'll
never
speak
of
it
again.
There
are
better
men
waiting
for
you.
Stiva
says...
Kitty,
my
lamb,
did
Konstantin...
What
has
Levin
got
to
do
with
it?
Anyway,
I'll
never
get
married.
The
whole
business
of
it
And
look
what
it's
done
for
you.

Because
it's
love.
ANNA:
I
want
you
to,
I
don't
care
about
it.
VRONSKY:
You
should
care.
Anyway,
someone
might
be
watching.

But
I'm
damned,
anyway.
I'm
not.
I'm
blessed.
-You
love
me.
-Only
me.
-Apart
from
Frou-Frou?
But
me
more
than
your
horse?
Yes.
Are
you
happy?
Yes.
And
you
love
me?
Yes.
How
much?
This
much.
This
much?
Yes.
-This
much?
And
this
much?
Yes.
This
much?

Yes.
This
much?
And
this
much?
So,
this
is
love.
This.

Countess.
I
thought
you
would
be
at
Peterhof
now.
I've
come
from
there.
I'm
distressed
that
you
haven't
Anna
wanted
a
change.
Nearer
to
Princess
Betsy
at
Tsarskoe
Selo.
The
guards
are
in
summer
camp
at
Tsarskoe.
Alexei
Alexandrovich,
forgive
me,
but...
You
are
too
tolerant.
Your
wife
is...
Oh!
Is
this
about
my
wife?
My
wife
is
beyond
reproach.
She
is,
after
all,
my
wife.

Alyosha!
Alyosha!

A
message
from

Maman.
Her
friend
Princess
Sorokina
has
a
house
here
-and
a
virgin
daughter.
Well,
that's
not
part
of
the
message,
but
they'll
all
be
at
the
races
and
you're
expected
to
supper
afterwards.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
I
give
you
the
regiment!
ALL:
The
regiment!

I
heard
you
turned
down
a
promotion.
That
was

Maman

interfering.
Yes.
And
now
she's
come
up

Alexei,
we're
brothers,
so
don't
take
offense.
Getting
married
puts
the
pack
on
your
back.
It
leaves
your
hands
free
Getting
serious
about
a
married
woman
is
like
carrying
your
pack
in
your
arms.
So,
they
talk
about
me.
I'm
leaving,
Sasha.
An
assignation?
Come
on,
I'll
introduce
you.

Beautiful.
A
man
would
come
to
no
harm.
FERGUSON:
Do
you
think
VRONSKY:
Makhotin's
Gladiator
is
favorite.
Sixteen
hands.
Frou-Frou
looks
dainty
beside
him.
But
she's
got
heart.
Haven't
you,
my
darling?

Anna.
Alexei!
What
is
it?
I
couldn't
bear
not
to
see
you
before
the
race.
What
were
you
thinking
about?
Tell
me.
I'm
pregnant.
Oh,
my
love.
Well,
love
was
never
a
game
to
us.
Here's
an
end
to
living
in
corners,
existing
day
to
day
on
lies.

Yes.
Now
we
can
be
together.
How
can
we,
Alexei?
Tell
Karenin
everything.
Do
you
think
my
husband
Leave
him.
Leave
him
and
be
your
mistress?
Yes,
run
away.
I
would
never
see
my
son
again.
The
laws
are
made
by
husbands
and
fathers.
What,
then?
I'll
never
forgive
myself
for
your
unhappiness.
Unhappiness?
I'm
like
a
starving
beggar
I,
unhappy?
No.
This
is
my
happiness.
ANNA:
Serozha!
Serozha,
I'm
coming
to
get
you!
Where
are
you?
Serozha!
Where
are
you?
How
are
you,
young
man?
Your
tutor
doesn't
seem
to
be
in
evidence.
Yah!

Alexei.
You
got
away
at
last.
Can
you
stay?
Why?
Go
and
find
Vasily
Lukich.
I
have
to
change.
Princess
Betsy
is
sending
her
trap
for
me.
Would
you
like
to
come?
Races,
surely.
No,
I'll
come
on
later.



Yes!
OBLONSKY:
Princess!
Princess!
A
bet!
Who
do
you
fancy
in
the
next?
Kusolev.
I'm
on
Vronsky.
Pair
of
gloves?
Done.

Alexander
Vronsky.
You
are
an
exquisite
creature.
You
really
ought
to
be




Yah!
Yah!
Go,
Frou-Frou!
Go!
Go!
Go,
Frou-Frou!
Go!


-Alexei!


I'm
here.


Oh.

I'm
here.

Get
up!
Get
up!
Her
back
is
broken.




You
know...
They
say
the
Emperor
The
danger
of
injury.
But
I...
What?
I'm
saying
I
think
there's
I
don't
understand.
In
my
opinion,
it's
not
the
sport
itself.
It's
making
a
cruel
spectacle
out
of...
What
are
you
talking
about?
-I
have
to
tell
you...
I
have
to
tell
you,
How
is
that?
By
making
plain
your
feeling
Your
conduct
was
improper.
It
must
not
occur
again.
I
have
said
it
before.
You
will
say
my
concern
You
are
my
wife.
I'm
wrong
to
think
that.
Yes?
Perhaps
I
was
mistaken...
No.
You
were
not
mistaken.
I
love
him.
I
am
his
mistress.
Do
what
you
like
to
me.

Wait.
Please,
move
away.
I
will
not
have
a
scandal.
You
will
behave
in
a
way
by
society
or
by
the
servants.
In
return,
you
will
keep
Tomorrow
you
will
return
home.
That
is
all.
Are
you
hurt?
What's
happened?
I
told
him
I'm
your
mistress.
He
thinks
I
can
give
you
up
and
go
on
living.
No.
You
cannot.
Time
for
bed?

It
was
pleasant
to
hear
Not
that
I
care
for
decorations,
but...
Alexei,
I
can't.
I'm
sorry.
Oh.
But
I'm
his
wife,
now.
I'm
having
his
child.
Tell
me
what
I
did
to
deserve
this.

Halt!
How
many
mowers
is
it,
Theodore?

Forty-two,
Master.
In
your
father's
time,
Though
he
never
picked
up
a
scythe
himself.
The
men
don't
like
me
for
it.
They
like
what
they're
used
to.
It
settles
me.
How
is
that,
Master?
When
I'm
mowing,
You're
here
to
be
As
it's
always
been,
by
the
grace
of
God.
My
father
owned
you,
Theodore.
Owned
you
like
chattels
Was
that
by
the
grace
of
God?
It
was.
That's
my
youngest
His
young
life
is
perilous
now
since
the
They
look
happier
than
I've
ever
been.
Is
it
living
simply
that
I'm
looking
for?

I'm
expected.
No.
I
will
not
live
like
this.
This
waiting
for
hour
after
hour,
not
knowing
when
I'll
ever
see
you
again.
Sorry.
It's
my
demon.
I
can't
help
it.
You
wrote
that
you
were
ill.
Don't
worry,
it
won't
be
for
long.
-Stop.
I
was
told
it
in
a
dream.
There.
It
was
only
a
bad
dream.
Yes,
and
I'm
only
-That's
all
nonsense.
Tell
me
it
is.
You
love
me,
only
me.
Your
note
said
your
husband
would
be
out.
He
was
late.
It
serves
him
right.
And
you...
Why
do
you
call
him
my
husband?
He
isn't
my
husband,
he's
a
clock.
But
it
was
awkward.
My
honor.
Do
you
think
of
your
honor
when
you're
Your
demon
again?
I'll
be
glad
to
die
before
you
start
to
hate
me.
Anna.
Put
your
hand
there.

You
can
feel
him
move.

I
respectfully
ask
Minister
Karenin
whether
his
proposals
for
the
regulation
of
these
scholarly,
God-fearing
Jews,
and
of...
But
I'm
afraid
I've
lost
the
Minister's
attention.
Who
is
here?
Only

Madame,

Your
Excellency.
I
wanted
to
see
him
because...
I
do
not
wish
to
know
What
are
you
doing?
I
want
his
letters!

I
am
going
to
Moscow
tomorrow,
with
a
commission
to
investigate
whose
conditions
I
will
not
return
to
this
house
until
divorce
Meanwhile,
my
son
No,
Alexei,
please.
Please,
leave
me
Serozha!
Do
you
think
I
would
let
you
have
my
son?
You
are
depraved.
A
woman
without
honor.
I
thank
God
the
curse
of
love
is
lifted
from
me.
I
need
your
advice.

-Come
on,
come
on!
Right,
after
you,
after
you.
-Are
we
late?
I'm
Countess
Nordston.
We
nearly
met
at
the
PRINCE
SHCHERBATSKY:
Come
into
the
fold.
Come
on.

You've
been
waiting
for
me.
Forgive
me.
Kitty
is
here.
Konstantin,
what
a
long
time
Since
you
saw
me,
When?
You
were
driving
to
Ergoshovo.
I
was
at
Kashin
for
the
haymaking.
Oh,
but
why
didn't
you...
I'm
so
glad
to
see
you.
You're
just
the
same.
I
hope
not.
I
was
young
and
silly
in
those
days.
Months
and
months
ago.
And
you
haven't
changed.
No.
I
haven't.

Permit
me
to
announce,
with
asparagus
and
roast
beef.
I
went
to
the
market
in
person.
An
extra
place.
I've
come
to
tell
you
I'm
going
to
divorce
your
sister.
Divorce?

Oh,
dear
me,
what
are
you
Well,
don't
be
in
a
hurry.
Stay
to
dinner.
And
later,
you
can
talk
it
over
with
Dolly.
Prince
Oblonsky,
Alexei,
divorce
is
one
thing.
PRINCESS
SHCHERBATSKY:
You
compared
with
dull,
old-fashioned
Moscow.
But
we
know
how
to
do
things.
Only
the
other
day,
I
hear
Vasya
Pryachnikov
Well,
what...
What
was
the
challenge
about?
Pryachnikov's
wife,
naturally.
PRINCE
SHCHERBATSKY:
It
was
a
matter
Sounds
like
barbarism
to
me.
Would
that
have
preserved
Still,
not
many
of
us
can
say
Love?
"Thou
shall
not
covet
thy
neighbor's
wife."
Would
you
die
for
love,
I
would.
But
not
for
my
neighbor's
wife.

An
impure
love
is
not
love
to
me.
To
admire
another
man's
wife
but
sensual
desire
indulged
a
kind
of
gluttony,
and
a
misuse
of
something
sacred,
so
that
we
may
choose
the
one
person
Otherwise,
we
might
as
well
be
cattle.
Ah!
An
idealist!

But
she
will
be
nobody's
wife.
She'll
be
ruined.
I
tried
to
save
her.
She
chose
ruin.
Alexei
Alexandrovich.
Look
at
me.
You
will
have
no
peace
of
mind
It
was
Anna
who
taught
me
that.
I
do
not
wish
to
forgive.
I'm
not
a
cruel
man.
I've
never
hated
anyone.
But
I
hate
her
with
all
my
soul
for
all
the
wrong
she
has
done
me.
OBLONSKY:
Now,
it
is
COUNTESS
NORDSTON:
Very
good.
Since
we
last
met,
there
is
something
I
have
What
is
that?
LEVIN:
This.
Do...
Not...
Did.
Did
not.
The
last
word
is
"never."
I
know
what
it
says.
Then.
But
now?
Can
you
forgive
and
forget?
I
never
stopped.


Why
doesn't
he
come?
He
is
kind.
He
will
forgive
me.
Her
fever
is
higher.
I
want
Alexei.
Why
doesn't
he
come?
Give
me
some
water.
No,
I
mustn't.
It
isn't
good
for
my
little
girl.
Or
let
her
have
a
nurse,
yes.
Don't
bring
her
here
because
Alexei
is
coming
and
it
will
hurt
him
to
see
her.
He's
come,
my
dear.
Look
there.
DOCTOR:
Her
deliverance
ANNA:
You
think
he
won't
forgive
me
No
one
knows
him
except
me.
I'm
not
afraid
of
him,
now.
I'm
afraid
of
death,
though.
Oh.

You
poor
man.
Let
him
come
closer.
Alexei.
Alexei.
Look
at
my
husband.
He's
a
saint.
Take
his
hand.
Thank
God.
Thank
God.

You
must
leave
now.
I
promise
to
send
for
you
if
she
asks
for
you.
I
don't
know
what
happened
to
me.
I
forgive
you.
I
forgive
Anna.
My
soul
is
filled
with
joy.
I
will
remain
with
her
Come
now.
Come
now.
Look
at
you.
You
look
like
what
you've
become.
I
fancy
you
will
be
asked
I
would
like
you
to
go,

Maman.
I'll
go
when
I'm
ready
to
go.
A
little
affair
with
a
married
woman
puts
a
finishing
touch
But
this
morbid,
selfish
obsession...
You've
publicly
humiliated
yourself
and
dishonored
So
you'd
better
come
back
You're
finished
here.
And
there
was
her
husband,
Rouge
all
over
his
face.

Ma
chÃ¨re,
le
scandale!
But
I'd
better
tell
you
some
regimental
news.
Who
is
here?
FOOTMAN:
Princess
Elisabeth
ANNA:
I
don't
want
to
see
him.
But
surely
your
husband
wouldn't
stop...
BETSY:
I'm
so
glad
to
see
you.
You
look
feverish.
We've
been
talking
too
much,
so
I'm
going.
Princess
Betsy
came
to
tell
me...
I
don't
want
to
hide
anything
from
you.
Count
Vronsky
asked
I've
told
him
that
I
can't
receive
him.
Well,
goodbye,
my
treasure.

I
agree
with
you.
As
he
is
going
away,
I
just
said
so,
so
there's
no
need
to
repeat
it.
But
it
is
for
you
to
decide.
Yes,
and
I
decided.
Then
I
am
very
glad
that...
That
we
agree,
Of
course.
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you?
Yes,
can
you
please,
I'm
a
bad
woman.
But
I
can't
breathe.
Your
kindness,
which
I
can't
repay,
You
begged
me
for
my
forgiveness.
But
I
didn't
die,
and
now
I
have
to
live
with
it.
Then
what?
What
do
you
want?
Do
you
know
what
you
want?

Not
to
say
goodbye.
I
can't
hear.
Not
to
say
goodbye.
You
would
be
lost.
Irretrievably
lost.
You
would
have
no
position.
And
worse,
if
we
divorce,
That
means
you
cannot
legally
remarry.
Your
union
with
Count
Vronsky
as
would
your
daughter,
And
this
is
what
you
want?
It
would
be
a
sin
to
help
you
destroy
yourself.
You
forget
something.
Count
Vronsky
and
I
love
each
other.
And
this
love
sanctifies
a
criminal
folly?
All
I
know
is
that
I
sent
him
away
and
it's
as
if
I'd
shot
myself
through
the
heart!
I
see.
And
what
of
Serozha?
I
would
die
for
him,
but
I
won't
live
like
this
for
him.
When
he
knows
of
love,
he
will
forgive
me.
Then
I
must
choose
the
smaller
sin.
Vronsky
has
robbed
me
of
my
cloak
No,
I...
My
darling.
My
darling.
You
look
so
pale.
Oh,
my
darling.
We'll
go
south
to
the
sea
air
and
sunshine.
Is
it
all
right?
Sit
down
a
minute.
I
want
to
see
everything.

A
moment.
And
now
I'm
doing
kitchenmaid's
work
because
Nadya's
parents
And
who
can
blame
them?
It's
indecent.


It's
Konstantin.
Yes,
good.
The
doctor
here
is
useless.
Get
me
one
from
Moscow.
Where
did
you
go?
I
asked
for
you
everywhere
I'm
sorry.
I
couldn't
leave
him.
Yes.
My
wife...
You
can't
stay
now.
I
will
nurse
him
with
Agafia.
The
woman
will
find
somewhere
in
the
village.
You
won't
see
her.
She
knows
it
is
impossible
to
meet
you.
It
is
a
torment
to
me
as
this
unfortunate...
As
this
fallen...
And
in
your
precious,
delicate
condition.
Oh,
Kostya.
Good.
A
clean
nightshirt
and
sheets.
A
towel
and
a
clean
pail
of
warm
water.
Wait.
And
bring
the
perfume
bottle,
in
the
outside
pocket
of
my
handbag.
MAN:
Twenty-one
to
Stremov,
four
to
Karenin.


Alexei,
they're
back.
Here,
in
St.
Petersburg.
She
has
written
to
me.
To
you?
They
think
I
don't
have
the
right
to
refuse.
It's
the
boy's
birthday.
My
friend,
you
would
be
blowing
on
the
embers
Let
me
write
to
her.
I'm
here
to
see
Serozha.
Madame?
I
beg
your
pardon,
Your
Excellency.
No,
I've
come
to
see
Serozha.

Serozha.
Maman?
Oh.
My
dear
little
boy.
I
knew
you
would
come.
Today
is
my
birthday.
I
know.
Are
you
crying?
No,
I
won't
cry.
SEROZHA:
Where
did
you
go,

Maman?
ANNA:
I
don't
know.
Everywhere.
The
south.
I
thought
about
you
every
day.
SEROZHA:
And
I
thought
And
you
must
love

Papa.
No
one
in
the
whole
world
is
better
than
you.
No.
Where's
Anya?
She's
still
asleep.
Should
I
take
your
coat?
Are
you
feeling
unwell,
madam?
I'm
not
sleeping.
I
can
send
out
for
something.
Yes.
Why
are
you
in
the
dark?
Yashvin
is
going
to
call.
You
remember
him.
Are
you
going
out?
To
where?
To
whom?
What's
the
matter?
I
didn't
know
what
happened
to
you.
But
I
told
you
yesterday.
My
brother.
Does
it
take
all
day
to
meet
your
brother?
Does
he
need
you
more
than
I
do?
What's
happened?
Well,
Alexander
agreed
to
everything.
Mother's
house
in
Moscow
will
go
to
him,
and
the
country
estate
will
be
our
new
home.
As
soon
as
the
divorce.
Karenin
hasn't
answered
your
letter
yet?
You're
the
very
first
I
received
a
note
from
Princess
Betsy
asking
me
to
call
on
her
Or
was
it
7:00?
But
perhaps
you'll
meet
at
the
opera
tonight.
I
would
love
to
be
there
if
I
could
get
a
box.
Madame,

your
box
is
number
four.
You'll
find
me
there
with
Princess
Myagkaya.
Will
you
come,
Vronsky?
-Well...
You
know
you
can't
go
to
the
theater.
-Annushka!
A
bath!
I'll
come
in
and
choose
a
dress.
Anna,
I
implore
you.
I'm
not
ashamed
of
who
I
am
Are
you
ashamed
for
me?
Why
don't
you
book
a
room
at
the
hotel?
Aren't
we
together?
Have
you
changed
towards
me?
It's
because
I
love
you
and
care
about
you.
If
that's
the
case,
then
I
don't
know
why
-That
would
make
it
worse.
Well,
I'm
not.


Should
we
visit,
or
stay
put?
Stay
put.
Minister!
Congratulations.
Come
in
for
a
moment.
PRINCESS
MYAGKAYA:
They're
from
Moscow,
Quite
well
off.
No
sons.
She's
a
widow.
My
dear,
I'm
a
sales
catalog.
Alexei.
You'll
come
up
to
see
us
afterwards?
I'll
talk
to
Varya.
Will
you
call
on
Anna?
Oh.
Alexei.
I'm
fond
of...
For
God's
sake!
Anna
isn't
a
criminal.
I'd
call
on
her
if
she'd
only
broken
the
law.
But
she
broke
the
rules.
PRINCESS
MYAGKAYA:
Who
has
made
Colonel,
would
you
be
so
kind?
YASHVIN:
Of
course.
Please,
I
would
be
honored
Thank
you.
How
very...

It's
a
disgrace.
Hush,
dear.
A
common
courtesy.
Everyone's
looking.
Let
them
look!
Fetch
my
cloak.
What
are
we
coming
to?
It's
an
insult
to
decency.
Take
me
home.
Hush.
I
beg
you,
my
dear.
I
have
a
word
or
two
for
some
people
one
didn't
expect
She
has
a
nerve,
Yes,
why
don't
you?
Rescue
her
and
put
your
seal
on
the
fiasco.
BETSY:
Alexei,
you
see
why
she
must
divorce.
Marriage
will
solve
everything.
As
far
as
I'm
concerned,
she's
my
wife.
As
you
saw,
she
isn't.
We're
going
to
Moscow,
That
sounds
like
a
good
idea.
But,
for
a
day
or
two,
Anna
will
be
at
home.
Then...
I'll
say
goodbye
now.
Well,
you
had
an
excellent
night.
Does
your
mother
want
you
-Either
one.
If
you
loved
me,
you
would
have
locked
me
Yes,
it
was
my
fault.
I
won't
sleep.
I
know
how
to
make
you
sleep.

Anna,
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you.
Are
you
well?
How
is
your
little
one?
Stiva
wanted
to
invite
you
but
it's
impossible.
No,
I
understand.
No.
No,
you
don't.
Kitty
and
her
husband
are
with
us.
She's
in
Moscow
to
have
the
baby.
Kitty!
Tell
her
how
pleased
I
am.
Perhaps
I'll
wait
a
year
or
two.
Love.
Yes,
love.
Don't
you
disapprove
of
me
No.
I
wish
I'd
done
the
same.
But
no
one
asked
me.
Well,
I
wouldn't
have
been
brave
enough.
Stiva,
you
know,
he
doesn't
change.
Like
all
men,
I
suppose.

I
had
an
inspiration.
Why
do
we
have
to
wait
here?
Why
can't
we
wait
in
the
country?
I
don't
want
to
hear
Good,
I'm
bored
here.
When
should
we
go?
If
I
bore
you
here,
I'll
bore
you
in
the
country.
I
didn't
say
you
bore
me,
Moscow
bores
I
can't
be
ready
by
tomorrow.
-The
day
after,
then.
No,
wait,
that's
Sunday.
I
have
to
see

Maman.
That's
20
minutes
away
on
the
train.
You
could
go
to
see
her
tomorrow.
Or
was
it
that
you
wanted
Please.
Don't
spoil
everything.
I
can't
see

Maman

tomorrow
because
she
won't
have
In
that
case,
let's
not
bother.
-I'll
leave
on
Sunday
or
not
at
all.
It's
absurd
to
you
because
you
have
-Anna.
You've
given
up
everything
for
me
-Why
lie
about
it?
I
put
off
our
departure
for
a
day
or
two
Because
I've
been
living
off
your
love
So
this
is
over.
Finished.
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
mind
when
we
go.
I'll
telegraph

Maman.

We'll
go
on
Sunday.
I'll
do
anything
you
want.
-You
should
leave
me.
Why?
You
can't
ask
"why"
about
love.
So,
will
you
be
all
packed?
I'll
be
out
today
making
the
arrangements.
Is
that
your
way
of
telling
me
with
that
simpering
little
princess?
No.
I'll
be
at
my
lawyer's,
Then
I'm
having
dinner
I
know
what
that
means.
My
God,
this
is
unendurable!
I
can
invite
them
here,
if
you
like.
Thank
you,
but
if
I'm
not
fit
Who
was
the
telegram
from?
I
didn't
show
you
because
Stiva
keeps
Karenin
promises
nothing,
but
will
consider...
I
told
you
I
don't
care
about
the
divorce,
Is
there
anything
you
wish
to
say
to
me?

So
it's
the
child.
She
brought
papers
from

Maman.
Anna.
No.





Oh,
God.
Forgive
me.
I'll
be
buying
in
feed
before
winter's
over.
Well,
you
don't
press
people
hard,
For
your
soul,
not
your
belly.
How
do
we
know
what's
rightly?
Just
by
knowing
it.
How
else?
But
I
believe
in
reason.
Reason.
Was
it
reason
I
came
looking
for
you.
I
understood
something.
What
did
you
understand?
He
smiled
at
me.
He's
very
advanced
for
his
age.
What
did
you
understand?
DOLLY:
I'm
so
proud
of
you.
LILI:
Night-night.
And
you,
too.
PRINCE
SHCHERBATSKY:

SEROZHA:
Anya!
Anya!
Anya!
