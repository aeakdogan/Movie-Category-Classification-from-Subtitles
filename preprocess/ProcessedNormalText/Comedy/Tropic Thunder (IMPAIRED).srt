Tugg
Speedman
is
dead
meat
Yeah.
We
could
do
something
which
is
in
the
other
direction!
Ain't
right.
What
would've
happened
if
Steve
McQueen
and
them
dudes
Well,
that's
what
that
movie
was
about.
l'm
trying
to
agree
with
you.
Then
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
huh?
'Cause
he's
cleaning
a
gun
l'm
just
like
a
little
boy,
Wait
a
minute.
Wait
a
minute.
l
got
an
idea.
Crazy's
better
than
nothing.
Back
in
'98,
l
did
a
low-budget
-Sex
Camp.
Remember
it?
Anyway,
me
and
the
campers
had
to
break
into
the
rich
girl
camp.
So,
what
we
did,
we
built
a
catapult
and
they
shot
us
over
the
wall,
Look,
-you
guys,
we
already
know
the
plan.
We
do
it
just
like
in
the
book,
The
book
of
Tropic
Thunder.
Yeah,
did
you
guys
read
the
book?
The
flap,
l
read
the
back
flap
Well,
it's
okay.
Cool.
You
guys
all
read
the
script,
right?
l
don't
read
the
script,
script
reads
me.
What
the
hell
does
that
even
mean?
What
you
getting
at
with
the
books,
All

The
Wet
Offensive.
Osiris

done
that
better.
They're
gonna
kill
him!
And
we'll
weep
for
him,
in
the
press.
Set
up
a
scholarship
in
his
name.
Eventually,
and
l'm
talking
way,
we
file
an
insurance
claim.
Preferably
before
Actually,
the
claim
alone
would
net
us
You
