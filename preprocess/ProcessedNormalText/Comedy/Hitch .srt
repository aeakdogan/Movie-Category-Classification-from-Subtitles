Basic
principles:
No
woman
wakes
up
saying:
"God,
I
hope
I
don't
get
Now,
she
might
say,
Or
something
like,
"I
just
need
some
space".
Or
my
personal
favorite:
"I'm
really
into
my
career
right
now".
You
believe
that?
Neither
does
she.
You
know
why?
You
understand
me?
Lying.
It's
not
a
bad
time
for
her.
She
may
be
into
her
career...
but
what
she's
really
saying
is,
Or
possibly,
"Try
harder,
stupid".
Well,
which
one
is
it?
60%
of
all
human
communication
Body
language.
30%
is
your
tone.
So
that
means
that
ain't
coming
out
of
your
mouth.
Toby!
Shit!
Of
course
she'll
lie
to
you.
She's
a
nice
person,
What
else
is
she
gonna
say?
Yet.
Luckily,
the
fact
is
even
a
beautiful
woman
doesn't
know
And
that's
where
I
come
in.
My
job
is
to
open
her
eyes.
Oh,
my
God!
Is
this
what
you're
looking
for?
Basic
principles:
No
matter
what,
any
man
has
a
chance
Just
needs
the
right
broom.
You
cannot
use
what
you
do
not
have.
So
if
you're
shy,
be
shy.
-
I'm
not
outgoing.
She
may
not
want
the
whole
truth,
She
may
not
want
to
see
it
all
at
once,
So
tonight,
when
you're
wondering
what
just
remember,
she
is
already
out
with
you.
That
means
she
said
yes
That
means
she
made
a
plan
So
that
means
it
is
no
longer
your
job
It
is
your
job
not
to
mess
it
up.
The
shoes
are
hot.
Yeah,
but
I
don't
think
they're
really
me.
"You"
is
a
very
fluid
concept
right
now.
You
bought
the
shoes.
That's
the
you
I'm
talking
about.
The
key
tonight
is
hang
back.
Give
her
plenty
of
space.
If
she
lingers
at
a
photograph,
move
on.
But
maintain
the
visual.
It's
supposed
to
be
64
and
clear
tonight.
Ask
her
what
she
thought
about
the
show...
what
was
her
favorite
photograph,
And
when
she
answers,
Don't
be
wondering
Listen
to
what
she
is
saying
and
respond.
Listen
and
respond.
That
way,
when
it's
your
turn
to
talk...
you'll
have
something
better
to
say
than,
What
was
your
favorite
one?
The
elephant,
definitely.
And
all
of
a
sudden,
Ready.
No
way.
We're
going
back
in
there.
In
case
you
didn't
go
to
high
school,
So
how
does
it
happen,
great
love?
Are
you
okay?
-
Nobody
knows.
Let
me
get
a
Bomb
Pop
But
what
I
can
tell
you,
One
moment,
you're
enjoying
your
life.
And
the
next,
you're
wondering
Three
dates
is
all
I
need.
Three
dates,
and
I'll
get
you
here,
where
eight
out
of
10
women
will
tell
them
everything
they
need
to
know
After
that,
you're
on
your
own.
But
always
remember...
life
is
not
the
amount
of
breaths
you
take.
It's
the
moments
that
take
your
breath
away.
Did
I
call
it
or
did
I
call
it?
I
mean,
what
did
I
say,
six
months?
And
when
was
her
first
date?
So
five-and-a-half?
What
is
it
about
guys
that
makes
them
even
when
they're
going
out
with
She's
only
the
most
fabulous
thing
Thanks,
Young.
Are
you
kidding?
Why
should
she
waste
her
heart
Even
if
he
is
gorgeous.
If
he's
stupid
enough
to
cheat...
the
world
should
know
Exactly.
I'm
in
the
elevator.
Good
morning,
how
are
you?
Bitter,
party
of
one.
You
should
try
it
sometime.
Barbados
by
myself?
It
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered.
I
slept
in,
I
did
my
yoga,
flirted
with
my
scuba
instructor.
-
And
apparently
never
left
the
office.
You
should've
taken
someone
with
you.
Who
am
I
gonna
take
with
me?
This
is
where
a
boyfriend
comes
in
handy.
-
I
don't
have
time
for
a
boyfriend.
Yes,
and
it's
as
true
today
as
it
was
then.
I
thought
you
were
on
vacation.
See
if
these
are
in
focus
Besides,
relationships
are
for
people
Spoken
like
a
true
cynic.
I'm
not
a
cynic.
I'm
a
realist.
You
are
a
realist
masquerading
as
a
cynic
What
are
you
doing
here?
She
works
here,
remember?
No,
she
doesn't.
Not
for
another
four
days.
-
This
couldn't
wait.
What
are
you
doing?
Go
back
to
the
beach.
-
I
don't
want
you
here.
You
are
becoming
and
this
is
exactly...
the
kind
of
nervous,
overwrought
behavior
Pictures
of
Sebby
with
a
busty
brunette.
A
very
big
raise.
Jesus.
You
could
find
dirt
in
a
snowstorm.
Comes
with
the
job.
You
know,
kiddo,
there
is
more
to
life
Can
I
help
he
was
cheating
on
my
beach?
I
think
it's
great
I'm
just
a
little
worried
as
to
why.
Let
me
worry
about
that.
Okay.
I
want
that
column
on
my
desk
So
you'll
pay
for
my
hotel?
For
you
to
sip
mai
tais?
-
Come
on.
-
That's
good,
right?
No,
it
was
in
and
it
freaked
out.
You
know
what
your
problem
is,
Hitch?
You
pick
your
shots
not
what's
necessarily
best
for
you...
in
the
long
run.
All
of
us
are
not
married
to
the
woman
You
know,
I'm
very
happy
for
you.
So
please
just
leave
me
to
my
hot,
sweaty...
totally
varied,
wildly
experimental
-
I
was
talking
about
pool,
but
whatever.
Honestly,
I
just
hope
one
day
the
unconditional
love,
trust,
that
I
share
with
Grace
every
single
day.
-
Is
this
really
barroom
talk?
Because
when
you
get
to
a
place
it's
so
beyond
anything
physical
that...
when
I
think
back
to
and
chase
all
these
really
gorgeous
I
don't
know,
it's
kind
of
ridiculous
Yeah,
I
see
what
you
mean.
That's
pathetic.
So,
how'd
you
meet
him?
I
was
in
La
Perla
-
And
he
was
doing
likewise?
Actually,
he
said
he
was
buying
something
His
mom?
Casey,
who
buys
high-priced
lingerie
Well,
maybe
he
was
looking
for
a
robe.
Casey,
he
was
hitting
on
you
while
-
I
prefer
the
mother
story.
No,
the
point
is
I'm
not
gonna
start
out
-
Why
not?
Like
me?
Is
that
what
you
were
gonna
say?
No.
I
was
gonna
say,
"Like
you".
-
What's
his
name?
-
I'm
gonna
Google
him.
Let's
just
see
if
his
mother's
still
alive.
-
So
when
is
Grace
due
again?
-
You
excited?
Do
you
want
me
to
go
get
them
No,
don't
do
that.
Are
you
saying
you
don't
wanna
talk
to
them
I'm
just
trying
to
keep
my
head
above
water.
-
Have
you
heard
of
the
Date
Doctor?
-
Really?
I
was
hoping
he
also
helped
women.
Casey,
you're
not
sick.
You're
single.
You
just
have
to
relax
and
enjoy
the
ride.
I
haven't
been
ridden
in
months.
On
that
happy
note,
I'm
gonna
go
see
-
You
mean,
besides
me.
Bye.
I'll
go
get
those
girls,
and
we'll
have
a
conversation
Then
you're
gonna
home,
Well,
that
sounds
like
fun
for
me.
-
Hey,
girl.
Hey,
baby,
can
I
get
a
couple
Coronas
Excuse
me.
Lime
wedges
in
the
bottle's
fine.
Hey,
asshole,
I
don't
work
here.
I'm
sorry.
The
paramedics
will
have
to
come
Just
don't
let
it
happen
again.
-
I
knew
you
didn't
work
here.
How
else
was
I
supposed
to
get
you
away
Why
would
you
want
to
do
that?
Some
guys
naturally
develop
a
comfort
They
like
women,
women
like
them.
Back
in
college,
I
was
just
not
one
of
them.
I
seemed
to
lack
the
basic
understanding...
that
my
peers
just
intuitively
grasped.
But
like
any
late
bloomer,
Her
name
was
Cressida
Baylor.
Can
you
tell
me
And
my
life
would
never
be
the
same.
-
I'm
Alex.
What
we
had
was
beautiful.
I
love
you.
I
love
you
so
much.
I
love
you,
too,
Alex.
I
know
you
don't
love
me
But
that's
okay.
In
retrospect,
But
the
experience
taught
me
a
lot.
Cressida!
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
sorry,
Alex.
But
I
love
you.
What
did
I
do
wrong?
You're
doing
it
right
now.
Alex,
I'm
sorry.
And
it's
an
education
Because
with
no
guile
and
no
game,
If
ever
a
man
born
was
without
game...
it
was
Albert
Brennaman.
My
business
is
100%
referral
And
if
there's
one
thing
I've
learned...
when
you
orchestrate,
coordinate,
it's
best
to
fly
under
the
radar.
I
hope
she's
single
Hi.
Thank
you
for
seeing
me.
Yeah,
no.
Is
that
a
problem?
I'm
a
little
uncomfortable
with
this
anyway.
Definitely
been
hurt
a
lot.
Some
good
ones.
I'm
desperate,
basically.
You
know,
not
just
for
anybody.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
about
her?
Let's
see,
what
can
I
say?
My
company
handles
her
finances.
Well,
I'm
one
of
them.
-
So
does
she
know
you're
interested?
Alive?
I
lent
her
my
pen
once.
Shoot.
Does
anyone
have
a
pen?
-
Here,
take
mine.
Sorry
about
that.
Here
you
go,
Allegra.
Allegra?
As
in
Allegra
Cole?
Yeah,
I
realize
that
I'm
not
her
usual
type.
Well,
her
last
boyfriend
owned
Sweden
And
that
guy
was
a
bum.
He
didn't
seem
like
You
swing
for
the
fence.
Look,
you
don't
think
I
tried
I
mean,
you
don't
think
I
know
I
just
thought
that
maybe
with
your
help...
You
know
what?
Hold
on
a
second,
Albert.
You
know
what
it's
like
Feeling
like
the
love
of
your
life
But
at
the
same
time,
even
if
it's
never
gonna
be
with
you?
You
are
flat-out...
out
of
your
mind.
You
know
that?
That's
good.
It
is?
You
ever
heard
of
Michelangelo?
Heard
of
the
Sistine
Chapel?
Michelangelo.
Sistine
Chapel.
You
saying
you
can
do
this?
My
name
is
Alex
Hitchens.
Take
it
easy.
Oh,
my
God!
Well,
it
looks
like
I'm
still
rich.
But
what
I
would
really
like,
if
I
could
have
$500,000
And
what
were
you
thinking
Well,
it's
something
Daydreams
are
for
private
time.
When
you're
in
the
room,
be
in
the
room.
Concentrate.
Focus.
My
friend
Maggie
is
a
talented
designer.
I've
seen
the
business
plan
And
I
would
really
like
to
get
involved.
I'll
tell
you
what.
Let
us
come
up
with
a
range
of
investments
and
next
month,
Okay.
Fine.
Thank
you.
All
right,
gentlemen.
Let's
go
over
this
one
more
time.
Shock
and
awe.
That
was
shockingly
awful.
Shock
and
awe.
What
is
the
objective?
-
Excuse
me,
sir.
I
don't
really
agree
with
that.
You
don't
really
agree
with
what?
I
think
if
you
want
to
invest
$500,000
that's
exactly
what
you
should
do.
You
don't
need
us
to
tell
you
what
to
do.
We're
a
board
of
advisers,
If
you
want
to
be
taken
seriously
then
start
taking
yourself
seriously
instead
of
asking
for
permission
from
a
boardroom
-
That's
quite
enough!
I'd
like
to
see
anybody
in
this
room
that
she's
had
to
deal
with
her
whole
life,
We
should
be
taking
advice
from
you,
-
Sit
down...
Oh,
my
God.
Just
breathe.
How'd
it
go?
I
yelled
at
her.
I
screamed
at
my
boss!
-
What?
-
I
gotta
go
back.
Relax.
Okay,
listen,
we're
fine.
-
Would
you
let
me
go?
Just
relax!
Okay?
-
Just
let
it
marinate
for
a
second.
Trust
me.
Relax.
-
It's
Allegra
Cole.
-
Could
I
speak
to
you
a
second?
Yes.
Hi.
What's
up?
Listen,
Albert,
right?
-
People
don't
usually
talk
to
me
like
that.
Let
me
rephrase
that.
People
never
talk
to
me
like
that.
Stand
up.
I
guess
it's
kind
of
scary
for
them.
But
that's
why
I
really
appreciate
But
I
was
wondering...
do
you
think
that
you
and
I
could
You
know,
to
go
over
things.
Financial
things.
I'd
like
to
see
the
areas
-
Check
your
schedule.
Great.
Let
me
give
you
my
number.
I
don't
think
I
have
one.
-
Yes,
I
do.
And
call
me
Allegra.
-
You're
done.
Good
job.
Oh,
damn.
She's
some
kind
of
newspaper
columnist.
What's
her
drink?
Usually
beer.
Hi.
I
noticed
your
glass
was
getting
low...
so
I
took
the
liberty
Thank
you.
And
I
couldn't
help
but
notice
-
What's
your
name?
You
can't
get
them
to
stop?
That
was
funny.
Listen,
I
understand
the
courage
it
takes
and
try
to
generate
a
relationship
-
So
don't
take
the
following
personally.
Thanks.
Try
to
listen.
This
is
no
reflection
on
you.
But
thank
you
for
the
compliment
You're
welcome.
Chip,
seriously,
that
was
not
code
for,
Are
you
always
so
shut-down
and
afraid
Feel
like
a
natural
woman?
Sorry
I'm
late,
honey.
Well,
there
was
a
beginning,
Nice
to
meet
you,
Chip.
You,
too.
On
the
one
hand,
to
even
speak
to
someone
But
on
the
other
hand,
So
life's
kind
of
hard
all
around.
Not
if
you
pay
attention.
You're
sending
all
the
right
signals:
No
earrings,
heels
under
two
inches,
wearing
reading
glasses
with
no
book,
which
means
you
had
a
hell
of
a
week
If
that
wasn't
clear
enough...
there's
always
the
"fuck
off"
Who'd
believe
there's
a
man
out
there
and
genuinely
be
interested
in
who
she
is,
I
wouldn't
even
know
So
what
would
a
guy
like
that
say?
He'd
say,
"My
name
is
Alex
Hitchens
But
she
wouldn't
be
interested
in
that...
because
she'd
be
counting
the
seconds
Thinking
he
was
like
every
other
guy.
Which,
life
experience
has
taught
her,
But
then
he'd
ask
her
name
and
she
might
blow
him
off.
Or
she
might
say...
I'm
Sara
Melas.
And
then
he'd
ask
because
he
was
sincerely,
No.
-
No?
But
he'd
see
that
there
was
no
way...
he
could
possibly
make
her
realize
Well,
he
could
be
funny
and
charming
Wouldn't
help.
-
Don't
you
hate
it
when
that
happens?
They'd
both
probably
go
on
My
guess
is
they'd
do
just
fine.
It's
a
pleasure
to
have
met
you,
Sara
Melas.
Grey
Goose
martini
Is
that
for
me?
What?
Vance
Munson.
Sorry
I'm
late.
No,
not
a
problem.
Wow,
you're
the...
-
Can
I
get
you
something
to
drink,
Mr...
So,
tell
me
about
her.
Have
you
ever
met
someone...
and
you
knew
right
away
Not
just
because
of
her
looks,
How'd
you
meet
her?
Actually,
I
was
in
a
shop
And
by
that,
of
course,
you
mean...
you
were
buying
lingerie
Yes.
You
can't
help
And
the
lingerie
is
for
a
woman
But
anyway,
the
girl
I
met,
she's
so
sweet,
funny,
Southern.
She
gives
me
her
number.
I
don't
know
what
it
is
about
her.
You
know,
food
has
lost
its
taste.
Things
that
used
to
matter...
I
think
things
aren't
gonna
snap
back
Unless
I
bang
her.
Excuse
me?
You
know,
bang
her.
Clear
my
head.
I
think
you
may
have
misunderstood
No,
I
was
told
you
help
guys
get
in
there.
Right.
But,
see,
here's
the
thing.
My
clients
actually
like
women.
Hit
it
and
quit
it
is
not
my
thing.
Let
me
make
one
thing
clear
to
you,
rabbi.
Well,
that
is
for
damn
certain.
And
I'm
glad
you
can
admit
it
You
see
what
I'm
doing?
Power
suit,
power
tie,
power
steering.
People
can
wince,
cry,
beg,
So
that's,
like,
a
metaphor.
Well,
I'm
more
of
a
literal
kind
of
guy.
So
when
I
do
this...
this
is
more
like
me
saying
if
you
ever
touch
me
again.
Okay,
pumpkin?
Got
it.
No.
Pablo,
I
can't
just
mention
your
restaurant.
No,
somebody
famous.
You
know
that.
-
Sara
Melas?
Okay.
Bye.
I
need
your
signature.
I
hate
it
when
a
guy
calls
a
girl
So
this
is
me
not
calling.
Over.
Yes,
you're
right.
I've
been
thinking
about
And
I
was
wondering
if
you'd
mind
I
can't.
I
have
a
couple
of
parties
Gossip
never
sleeps.
Not
till
about
4:00
a.m.
Saturday.
I
have
a
date.
Do
you
know
the
definition
An
excuse
to
be
obnoxious?
Continuing
in
a
course
of
action...
without
regard
to
discouragement,
Okay,
Webster,
how
do
I
get
rid
of
you?
Breakfast,
Sunday.
You
do
that
with
out-of-town
relatives
Come
on.
Okay,
I
guess
I
could
do
Sunday.
You
forgot
to
say
"over".
Over.
This
conversation's
over
7:00
a.m.,
North
Cove
Marina.
Over
and
out.
7:00
a.m.?
Are
you
crazy?
-
Hello?
-
What?
Yeah.
What
if
I
would
have
said
Friday?
Sunday.
So
I
guess
you're
not
going
to
church.
Do
you
really
expect
me
to
wear
this?
It'll
be
awful
cold
out
there
without
it.
-
Good
morning.
You're
a
lot
taller
than
I
remember.
You
ever
ride
one
of
these?
Not
on
the
Hudson.
So,
what
do
you
wanna
do?
If
there's
time.
-
But
you
might
need
these.
-
Bam.
How
do
I
look?
Fabulous.
All
right,
I
give.
Where
do
I
change?
So
we'll
go
past
the
wall,
then
take
a
left.
-
Straight
shot
to
where?
What
you
do
with
these
babies
is...
Yeah,
what
I
do
with
this
baby
-
What
happened?
You
change
your
mind?
Did
you
put
gas
in
it?
No.
You
know,
I
think
it
must
have
Gross.
Try
it
again.
You
want
me
to
call
AAA?
Come
on
around
I
don't
know.
What
if
you
break
mine,
too?
-
I
didn't
break
it.
It
just
died.
All
right,
hop
on.
-
Scoot
back.
But
you
don't
know
where
we're
going.
Why
don't
you
tell
me?
Man,
male
egos.
I
don't
know
how
you
guys
What?
It
is
not
my
ego.
I
just
don't
want
to
ruin
the
surprise.
I'm
sorry.
Are
you
all
right?
There.
I
always
keep
a
few
of
those
around.
Thank
you.
I
have
lower
back
trouble.
No.
That's
a
fresh
one.
So,
Ellis
Island.
I
have
to
admit,
I
have
lived
in
New
York
I
figured
that.
Most
people
haven't.
So
I
got
my
man
Larry
here
-
Great!
It
was
originally
known
as
Oyster
Island.
The
island
was
expanded
with
dirt
removed
during
the
construction
-
Are
you
serious?
-
Did
you
know
this?
In
fact,
over
100
million
Americans
back
to
a
single
man,
woman,
or
child
to
an
inspector's
ledger.
By
1910,
75%
of
the
residents
of
New
York...
Chicago,
Detroit,
Cleveland,
and
Boston...
were
immigrants,
They
generally
lived
in
Little
Italys,
Chinatowns
It's
called
The
Kissing
Post.
The
plaque
explains
how
different
cultures
Now,
what
exactly
would
qualify
I
mean...
-
That
count?
I
actually
had
a
relative
come
through
here.
-
Really?
What?
-
What?
No.
You
know,
I
was
just
thinking...
you
can't
really
know
where
you're
going
-
Ain't
that
right,
Larry?
That's
kind
of
deep
for
a
first
date,
What
is
that?
Oh,
my
God!
That's
my
great-great-grandfather.
Jesus,
it's
right
here!
How
did
you
know?
Hitch
did
the
search.
I
just
found
the
page.
I'm
sorry.
I
saw
that
going
differently
in
my
mind.
So
my
family
never
saw
him
again.
Look,
I'm
really
sorry.
When
I
saw
it
on
the
computer,
I
thought
it
was
a
profession,
It's
just
one
of
those
horrible
family
legacies
But
thank
you.
No,
it
was...
-
A
train
wreck.
Let
me
get
you
a
cab.
Thanks.
-
Bye.
Taxi!
Poor
guy.
It
was
fun.
In
a
disastrous
kind
of
way.
At
least
you
got
a
good
story
Right?
-
You
should
try
mine,
it's
great.
Well,
look,
you
said
that
to
let
me
down,
right?
Which
he
did.
Yeah,
but
he
did
it
with
flair.
I
mean,
Case,
he
really
tanked.
And
that's
a
desirable
trait?
Yeah.
Weird,
huh?
Now,
just
keep
it
simple.
We're
just
leaving
a
message.
Women
like
Allegra
Cole
Hello?
She's
on
the
phone!
-
Yes.
Hello,
Miss
Cole?
Hi,
I
have
Albert
Brennaman
for
you.
-
One
moment,
please.
We
called
her
to
tell
her
you're
at
lunch?
Allegra.
Hi,
it's
Albert
Brennaman.
Hi,
how
are
you?
Good.
I'm
doing
good.
The
reason
I'm
calling
Not
gonna
be
able
to
make
it.
Well,
when
can
you
make
it?
When
can
I
do
it?
I
don't
even
know,
Right.
But
it's
all
good.
No,
we're
gonna
make
it
happen
though,
We're
going
to
make
it
happen.
Yes.
What's
going
on
over
there?
Just
moving
some
things
around.
Sky
Studios.
Tonight
I'm
actually
going
Designer
friend.
I
just
thought
it
might
be
something
Yeah,
definitely.
Well,
great.
-
Allegra,
over
here,
please.
Great.
One
more.
-
Hi,
there.
I
suppose.
Hey,
where's
Maggie?
Late
as
usual.
Tonight
I
want
you
to
meditate
Do
you
know
why
I
want
you
to
do
that?
Because
I'm
cool?
-
No.
I'm
saying
that
you
are
an
iceberg...
in
that
over
90%
of
your
mass
I
know
I'm
heavy.
I
am.
I'm
talking
about
who
you
are.
Accounting,
business...
all
of
that
is
just
a
small
part
One
more.
It's
gonna
be
loud
in
there...
so
this
is
our
opportunity
in
a
non-sleazy
way.
So
get
to
where
it's
loudest.
Lean
in,
place
your
hand
and
say
it
in
her
ear
like
a
secret.
Watch
your
hand
placement.
Too
low
says,
"I
just
wanna
grab
some
ass".
Friends.
Ass.
Me.
Special
issues:
Allegra
Cole
is
a
celebrity...
which
means
that
when
people
talk
to
her,
She's
classy,
so
she'll
introduce
you.
When
she
does,
shake
hands
hard
Show
her
you
can
handle
being
her
escort.
-
Egon,
this
is
Albert.
-
Albert,
this
is
Zak.
These
guys
are
friends
with
Maggie.
-
Been
to
that
new
Brazilian
restaurant?
It's
disgusting.
Did
you
see
the
new
installation
at
MOMA?
-
Yes,
did
you
think...
Women
can
always
tell
Worst
thing
you
can
do
is
try
to
fake
it,
And
you
do
have
something
What
was
your
name?
Eggnog?
Egon.
What
do
you
think
of
the
design
of
the
Jets'
Let
me
guess.
Disgusting?
Think
it
over.
We'll
be
back.
Thank
you.
I
can't
stand
those
guys.
Really?
I
kind
of
liked
them.
But
when
all
is
said
and
done...
tonight
is
not
about
Allegra.
-
It's
not?
A
woman's
best
friend
has
to
sign
off
So
you
can't
afford
to
mess
this
up.
Albert,
I
want
you
to
meet
Hi,
Maggie.
I'm
Maggie.
-
No,
you're
not.
Magnus
Forester.
-
You
have
very
soft
hands.
-
Wow.
So
do
you.
So
tonight,
you
focus
on
one
thing
Maggie.
-
Where
does
your
inspiration
come
from?
Anything
I
see.
Something
in
a
magazine,
in
an
old
movie.
The
receptive
nature
of
the
creative
facility
Anybody
want
any
spring
rolls?
That's
a
beautiful
tie,
by
the
way.
Thank
you.
-
Is
he
gay?
I
like
him.
About
the
deejay.
But
if
she
asks,
you
cannot
say
no.
I'm
not
worried
about
dancing.
I'm
sorry,
I
hate
to
be
a
stickler,
Show
me
what
you
mean
Trust
me.
You
know
what
I'm
gonna
do.
That's
what
it's
all
about,
right
there.
See
how
it
gets
bigger?
Now
I'm
gonna
start
the
fire.
But
the
feet
are
going.
Hips
are
always
going.
Can't
get
enough
hip.
From
there,
the
Q-Tip.
Q-Tip.
Throw
it
away.
That's
not
working,
hit
them
with
this.
Don't
ever...
do
that
again.
Do
you
hear
me?
-
Just
expressing
myself.
Not
like
that,
you're
not,
all
right?
This
is
where
you
live.
Right
here.
You
live
right
here,
okay?
This
is
home.
None
of
this.
I
don't
wanna
see
none
of
that.
Don't
need
no
pizza.
They
got
food
there.
Elbows,
6
inches
from
the
waist,
Don't
you
bite
your
lip.
Stop
it.
Women
relate
dancing
to
sex,
all
right?
Even
a
great
dancer
can
lose
it
Okay,
now
that's
what
I
need
to
be
learning.
Can't
stop
it.
You
cannot
stop
it.
Next
subject.
Get
out.
Thanks.
So,
are
you
a
Knicks
fan?
When
they're
good.
-
I'm
really
sorry.
-
She
was
there?
My
phone
fell
in
the
Hudson.
Yeah,
well,
it
gets
worse.
I
don't
believe
this.
-
I
thought
he
was
a
bodyguard.
-
Max
is
gonna...
When
I
got
the
train
this
morning,
Who
the
hell
is
Albert
Brennaman?
-
Tell
me
how
this
happened.
Does
this
even
look
like
dancing
to
you?
That's
just
a
little
bit
of
me
being
me.
No,
that's
you
being
a
lot
of
something
-
It's
just
one
dance.
One
dance,
one
look,
one
kiss.
Just
one
shot
to
make
the
difference...
between
happily
ever
after
and:
"Oh,
he's
just
some
guy
All
right?
-
What?
Is
that
a
problem?
It's
not
a
problem,
but
this
is
Allegra
Cole.
Eight
out
of
10
women
believe
will
tell
them
everything
they
need
to
know
And
believe
me,
-
She
has?
Not
that
she's
gonna
act
on
it.
-
All
right,
it's
no
big
deal
then.
-
Huge.
You
are
not
listening...
I
need
you
to
wrap
your
head
around
this.
Tomorrow
night,
Allegra
Cole...
could
have
her
last
first
kiss.
All
right,
come
on,
-
What
do
you
mean?
I
wouldn't
kiss
you.
I'm
not
me,
I'm
Allegra.
But
you're
really
not,
so...
Okay,
Albert,
end
of
the
night,
-
Show
me
the
magic.
God,
Albert,
Yeah,
how
about
those
Knicks?
You
see
what
I'm
doing?
A
woman
that
doesn't
want
a
kiss...
takes
her
keys
out,
puts
them
in
the
door,
A
woman
that
wants
to
kiss,
she
fiddles.
I'm
fiddling.
Okay,
you
have
a
good
night
now...
-
You
see
what
I'm
doing?
No.
This
is
what
most
guys
do.
But
you're
not
most
guys.
See,
the
secret
to
a
kiss
and
then
hold.
-
For
how
long?
for
her
to
come
the
other
10%.
Okay,
90%
-
10%.
Got
it.
Okay,
come
on.
Shake
it
off.
It's
your
turn.
I
had
a
really
nice
time
tonight,
Albert.
I
had
a
great
time
tonight,
too,
Allegra...
with
a
beard.
What's
up?
-
I'm
not
feeling
it.
I'm
not
feeling
like
you
want
it.
Look,
I'm
Allegra
Cole,
The
woman
whose
green
eyes
Now,
show
me
the
magic,
Albert.
-
What
the
hell
was
that?
No,
I
said
come
90%
and
then
I
come
10%!
You
don't
go
the
whole
100%!
My
mouth
was
open,
Albert.
Other
than
that,
how
was
it?
They
came
together,
they
danced
together,
He's
cute,
in
a
sheepdog
kind
of
way.
For
all
I
know,
he's
adorable.
But
him
dating
her
is...
You
seem
stressed.
You
and
I
had
an
understanding.
If
you
invite
Allegra,
I
didn't
invite
her.
Honestly,
sweetie,
-
So
you
invited
Albert?
Look,
it
says
here
the
tickets
What?
Machine.
Hi,
it's
Sara.
I
just
wanted
to
say
thank
you...
for
an
unforgettable
experience...
the
other
day.
And
if
you
ever
want
to
see
you
can
come
by
Okay,
bye.
-
Do
you
think
he'll
show?
He's
too
much
of
a
player
Is
this
a
source
or
a
date?
A
source.
Well,
it
sounded
like
a
date.
Well,
it
was
supposed
to.
So
it
looks
like
a
date
-
but
it's
not
a
date.
Just
checking.
Hi.
I
wasn't
sure
you
got
my
message.
I
wasn't
sure
you
called
the
right
guy.
Either
that
or
I
really
wanna
pay
you
back.
I
think
this
is
yours.
Thank
you.
Really?
There's
a
whole
wall?
