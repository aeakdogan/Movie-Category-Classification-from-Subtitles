So

me.
How
was
Hawaii?
-
It
was
unbelievable.
-
Well,
what
happened?
It
was
the
best
week
of
my
life.
It
was
just
a
little
But
he
was
so
sweet.
He
took
me
to
all
these
We
went
scuba
diving...
-
Snorkeling.
We
went
cliff
diving.
Well,
we
got
a
little
drunk.
-
He
gave
me...
We
slow
danced...
in
the
rain.
But
it
wasn't
just
about
the
sex.
He
pounded
me
like
a
mallard
duck.
It
ended
kind
of
weird,
though.
When
I
asked
for
his
number,
-
Married.
-
Entering
the
priesthood.
He
just
kind
of
ran
away.
You
know,
it
was
just
I
won't
forget
my
week...
with
Henry
Roth.
-
Henry
Roth.
Harry
Paratesticles.

Henry
Roth,
why
didn't
you
tell
me
I
prefer
intelligence
operative,
Well,
can
I
call
you
when
I
land?
You
can
call
me,
but
I'll
be
in
Peru.
Come
on,
that's
a
187,
code
blue.
He's
slipping
his
arm
in
the
drawer
Got
it?
Well,
maybe
when
you

I
don't
think
that's
an
option,
Lisa.
I
know.
I
changed
your
name
We
have
to
go
our
separate
ways
now.
Well,
goodbye.
Got

hell
is
your
problem?

You

it.
How's
your
balls?
Easy,
Honah
Lee.
Hey,
I'm
a
person,
not
a
seal.
Well,
I
am
a
vet,
not
a
doctor.
So
just
I
know,
it's
okay.
You
see
what
happens
Now,
why
you
gotta
spread
those
lies?
They
only
bite

All

All
of

on
us.
All
right.

that.
Lung

is
bad
for
you.

the
island.
Why
do
you
say
...and
why
is
your
foot
I
don't
want
your
ass
on
it,
either.
It
could
happen.
Then
you
won't
be
able

You'll
be
stuck

Don't

Because
you're

I
think
she's
a
local

...but
I

of

I
thought
you
liked
your
bitches
Yeah,
that's
usually
my
policy.
Freeze

Sounds

Oh,

I
hope
you

What's

Are
you

You're

Fry

You
got
it.
-
Hi,
Lucy.
You
know,
why
don't
you
try
this?
It's
kind
of
a
hinge.
-
Now,
why
didn't
I
think
of
that?
Don't
be
hard
on
yourself.
Right.
Sometimes
you
need
Fresh
eye
never
hurts.
I'm
Lucy.
Yes.
I'm
Henry
Roth.
-
Nice
to
meet
you.
It's
pretty.
Keep
up
the
good
work.
Wait.
I
see
you're
sitting
there
alone.
-
Sure,
that'd
be
great,
if
that's
all
right.
-
So
are
you
an
architect?
Oh,
that's
where
the
smell
Yeah,
yeah,
I
was
feeding
...and
I
thought
I
got
most
of
it
-
I
love
that
smell.
-
Fish
don't
even
like
that
smell.
He
and
my
brother
Doug,
they
go
And
I
miss
them
so
much
while
they're
...I
just
hold
on
to
them
And
they
smell
just
like
your
hands.
Well,
my
fingers
are
available...
...for
your
sniffing
pleasure
-
Wanna?
Sea
lions
are
known
...and
dolphins
are
known

Walruses
are
known
for
their...
Their
tusks.
Also
their
male
parts
Yeah,
yeah,
it's
the
second
biggest
-
What's
the
first?
I
like
your
laugh.
I
like
you
making
me
laugh.
I
hate
to
break
this
up,
Oh,
okay.
Sorry,
Sue.
And
the
real
cool
thing
about
walruses
-
Mysterious?
We
don't
really
know
what
Don't
they
just
sleep
on
icebergs
All
we
really
see
is
what
they
do
...but
who
knows
what
...where
they
spend
Well,
maybe
they're
intimidating
the
That
is
one
theory.
-
I
have
to
go.
It's
my
dad's
birthday,
and
we
go
-
It's
a
tradition.
...I
had
a
great
time.
-
Me
too.
Would
you
like
to
have
breakfast
-
Because
I
teach
an
art
class
at
10.
-
Yeah.
...but,
yes,
I
will
be
there.
-
Take
care.
-
One
for
the
road.
It
is
fishy.
-
Aloha.
See
you
tomorrow.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
goodness.
Shit.
I
had
a
bee
on
me.
-
All
right.
Which
means
That
was
the
stupidest-looking
I'm
gonna
take
a
Molokai
No
throwing.
Come
on.
Stop
laughing,
you
hyenas.
Okay,
you
heard
me.
Go!
Go!
Show
papa
what
you
got.
-
You
suck,
you're
good
at
everything.
By
the
way,
cuz,
I
met
this
sexy,
blond
I
told
her
you
the
kahuna
You
want
her
number?
You
pimping
tourists
for
me
again?
Yes!
I
live
vicariously
My
life
sucks.
Now,
come
on.
Give
her
the
Waikikiki
Ula
needs
it.
I
imagine
I
did
it
and
then
I'm
staying
in.
Sorry.
-
What?
Not
now,
Keanu
Mokokokakau.
But
your
stitches
are
bleeding.
It
must've
been
my
huge
back-swing.
You
think
you
can
stitch
me
up
-
Yeah,
looking
forward
to
it.
You
might
attract
a
shark.
What's
wrong
with
that?
Is
that
right?
A
shark
bit
me.
Nice.
Go
smoke
another
one,
bro.
That
shark
theory's
Now,
will
everybody
keep
it
down...
...while
I
whack
the
crap
Sit!
Stay!
Shit!
No!
Where
the
hell
is
it?
Looking
for
something?
Oh,
my
God!
The
same
thing
you
are.
This
is
weird.
I've
been
thinking
Can't
wait
to
have
breakfast
I
know.
And
I
just
wanna
eat
you
up.
-
Really?
...and
the
next
day
and
the
next
day.
Oh,
my.
Oh,
Lucy,
that
feels
so
good.
No,
my
nipples
are
too
sensitive.
-
What
happened?
...bounced
back
and
hit
you
in
-
What?
And
what's
up
with
your
nipples?
I
can't
be
falling
for
a
local.
-
This
where
you
got
hit?
You're
so
lucky
you're
a
professional
-
Yeah,
well,
it's
a
living.
-
We
never
get
to
have
any
fun.
I'd
like
to
do
something
Taking
it
deep,
aren't
you?
How
about
another
-
Why
don't
I
just
tap
a
keg
for
her?
I
think
I'm
getting
kind
of
drunk.
-
Are
you
getting
drunk?
So,
what
are
you
thinking?
What
am
I
thinking?
Actually,
I'm
not
drunk
at
all,
...because
there's
no
alcohol
Sadly,
I've
used
this
technique
It
helps
lovely
tourists,
...loosen
up
without
impairing
...and
have
guilt-free,
-
Wow.
I'm
not
a
cliff
diver,
either.
Well,
since
it's
my
last
night
in
town...
...can
I
pretend
you
didn't
just
say
that
I
can't
do
it.
I'm
sorry.
Well,
can
you
at
least
point
me
in
That
guy
over
there
-
Isn't
that
a
woman?
But
you're
too
drunk
to
notice,
-
Hey,
you.
Aloha.
Not
aloha,
"hello,"
aloha,
"goodbye.
"
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
-
Don't
move.
I
have
to
talk
to
you.
-
Hey!
Tattoo-Face!
Hi.
Hi.
My
fingers
are
extra
fishy
today,
What
was
that?
I
was
petting
my
walrus
all
morning
Okay,
pervert.
What?
I
was
joking
because
Yesterday?
I've
never
even
met
you.
-
Nick!
I
need
help!
Nick,
put
that
down.
-
You,
follow
me.
I
was
kidding
around
with
you!
What's
happening
here?
Lucy
is
a
very
special
person.
Okay.
About
a
year
ago,
Lucy
was
She
and
her
father
went
up
Her
father
broke
some
ribs,
but
Lucy
She
lost
her
short-term
memory.
So
she
can't
remember
anything?
No,
no,
no,
she
has
all
of
her
That's
a
different
part
Her
whole
life,
up
to
the
night
before
She
just
can't
retain
It's
like
her
slate
gets
wiped
clean
Hold
on.
This
sounds
like
something
...so
she'd
stop
calling
me.
I
wish
I
was
making
this
up!
She
has
no
memory
What
about
the
She
says
that
every
day,
...she
wakes
up
thinking
it's
She
comes
for
breakfast
because
...and
October
13th
She
has
no
idea
She
reads
the
newspaper.
It's
a
special
paper
her
father
It's
from
the
day
of
her
accident.
Lucy
does
the
same
thing
every
day.
-
Hello!
-
Hi,
Dad!
You
got
one
without
me.
The
lady
at
the
farmers'
market
I
didn't
wanna
hurt
her
feelings.
I
think
she
likes
you.
-
Yeah,
what's
not
to
like?
Well,
I
have
another
idea.
White.
Now
it's
too
white.
Oh,
yeah,
you
definitely
Well,
you
know,
-
Really?
-
Paint
me
something
for
my
birthday.
And
promise
that
we
can
pick

Sounds
great.
Hey,
you
should
watch
the
Vikings
Good
idea.
-
Yeah,
baby.
Isolate.
-
Spaghetti,
Pop.
Sorry,
Pop.
Go
Vikings.
Seven
hundred
and
five.
-
Seven
hundred
and
seven.
Hey,
sweetie.

You'll
see.
-
Oh.
What's
the
score?
-
Lf
they
score,
they
bring
it
to
14-10.
And
I'll
bet
Culpepper
runs
it
in.
I'll
bet
he
fakes
a
handoff
to
Williams,
-
Loser
does
the
dishes?
Keep
the
offense
on
the
field.
Culpepper
fakes
a
handoff
He's
got
Kleinsasser
in
the
end
zone!
Doug,
you're
good.
Maybe
you
should
be
a
coach.
-
Dad.
That
hurt.
And
you
don't
look
a
day
over
25.
Yeah,
right,
and
Doug's
muscles
What?
I
use
an
herb
supplement...
...that
can
be
purchased
at
any
Check

glutes.
Pretty
sweet,

You're
gonna
make
me
Okay,

your
present.
Okay.
Let's

we've
got
here.
The
Sixth
Sense.
Hey!
When
I'm
done
doing
the
dishes,

Ben
Friedkin?
Some
people,
they
call
me
freak.

Ronald
Sumner?
Just

me
a
chance...
I
can't
believe
it.
I'm
shocked.

getting
so
big,

perfect
for
you.
You
can

with
Her
plane
leaves
every
night?
-
What
is?
No,
it
isn't.
You
meet
her,
hang
out,
flirt,
-
She's
got
brain
damage,
you
psycho.
But
I
think
it'd
be
healthy
for
you.
You
haven't
allowed
yourself
I
appreciate
your
interest,
Hey,
you'd
be
doing
exactly
Giving

a
wonderful

you're
gone.
I'm
not
sure
about
the
"poofing"
part,
Demonstrate
a
good
poof
for
me?
Quit
busting
my
coconuts
All
right.
Would
you
stop
poofing
Okay.
Let's

this
sucker
ready.
Then

Sue
say?
She
said
that
if
I
talk
to
Lucy,
She's
the
boss,
cuz.
Lucy
probably
didn't
wanna

What
does
that
mean?
She
doesn't
want
guys
hitting
on
her
She
does
if
it's
Henry
Roth.

Who

I
bet
you

bucks
I
can
get
her

You're

-
How

doing,
honey?
Oh,
mahalo.
Nick
and
I
have
an
arrangement.
Don't
worry.
You

Swivelly
door.
Waffleonians
can
Are
you
from
a
country
where
it's

sorry
to
bother
you...

like
a
person

I
wanted
your
opinion.
I
drew
this.
It's
a
picture
of

have
that?
I
need

Shut

Looks

stupid
asshole

Excuse
me.
Okay.

No,

all
right.
L...
Yeah,
I'm
fine.
I'm
having
Something
that
I
could
help
you
with?
No,
no,
no.
I
just...
...can't
read.
You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
-
I
can
read
that
for
you.
I
can
do
this
on
my
own.
Appreciate
the
sentiment.
I'm
gonna
get
an
order
of
the...
Pan...
Pan...
Panku...
Ca...
Panclocks.

Pancakes.

Pancakes.

Stupid.
Stupid.
Stupid.

you

Okay.

That
sounds
nice.

Okay,

you.
So
I

Except
after
C?
Okay,
and
C
is
that
little

Yes.

How'd
you
get
so
good
at
teaching?
I'm
an
art
teacher
at
Well,
you
Haluki-liki
the
kind
of
I
know
I
would
if
I
was
in
your
class.
Okay.
Oh,
boy,
do
my...
That
doesn't
gross
you
out,
does
it?
No,
not
at
all.
Really?
If
Lucy
gets
hurt,
I'm
gonna
chop
you
Okay,
okay.
So
I
had
a
nice
time.
-
Yeah,

Let
me
get
it
for
you.
Sure.
Okay.
I
just
want
to
eat
you
up,
tomorrow
I'll
see
you
around.
Okay.
Really?
That's
it?
-
That's
what?
...and
phony
"I
can't
read"
stuff,
...or
for
my
phone
number?
-
I
can't
read.
That
was
one
of
the
goofiest
things
"Hey,
if
this
guy
is
so
desperate
...he
might
be
worth
talking
to.
"
But
then
I
get
stiffed.
No,
no,
no,
Mahalo
for
the
ego
boost.
-
You're
right.
You're
right.
I
feel
like...
I
gotta...
I
didn't
know
I
came
before
E!
Oh,
you
idiot.
I
hope
you're
happy,
Shamu.
Marlin.
It's
Sue.
-
Oh,
aloha,
sir.
My
name's
Henry...
-
I
want
to
apologize
to
your
daughter.
She's
inside.
Dad,
the
damn
mongoose
-
Is
this
the
guy?
Mr.
Roth,
I
have
one
simple
request:
Stay
away
from
my
daughter.
Absolutely.
I
hurt
her
feelings
It's
gonna
end
like
this.
Calm
down,
little
fellow.
I'm
gonna
kill
you!
You're
a
dead
man.
I'm
calm.
-
Let
me
help
you
up.
It's
just
Dad
and
I
work
too
hard
I
know
what
you
guys
do
If
you
know
her
condition,
you
know
The
next
morning,
And
any
guy
who's
okay
with
that...
...ain't
okay
with
me.
-
I'm
not
looking
for
a
one-night
stand.
Give
us
a
break.
My
daughter's
been
through
enough.
Okay.
I'm
sorry.
I
could
have
whooped
his
ass,
Yeah,
well,
maybe
you
need
to
do
Cheap
shot,
Dad.
So
fresh
and
so
clean.
Hey,
Alexa,
did
you
hook
up
-
I
chickened
out.
Yeah,
I
don't
know.
-
What?
Get
out
of
here.
Let
me
ask
you
something,
Alexa.
If
you
promised
a
girl's
dad
...would
you
consider
that
-
Absolutely.
Then
again,
there
are
always
ways
-
Like?
...if
I
promised
a
woman's
father
...I
would
simply
shut
my
eyes
That's
actually
a
cool
way
to
look
at
it.
And
a
very
gross
way.
He
asked
me
not
to
go
to
the
Hukilau.
I'm
not
doing
anything
wrong.
Sorry
to
bother
you.
-
Car
trouble?
Okay.
Appreciate
your
time.
Not
everybody
would
have
stopped.
-
You're
real
sweet.
I
can't
believe
you
fell
for
that.
Well,
my
grandfather
died
I'm
sorry.
I
can't
believe
you
fell
for
that!
Oh,
my
God.
That
was
very
good.
-
My
name's
Henry.
Nice
to
meet
you.
Hi.
Sorry
for
the
delay.
-
No
problem.
No
worries.
Breakfast?
-
Yeah.
I
had
waffles.
They
were
delicious.
I
like
making
little
houses
-
You
do?
-
What's
your
name?
Hi,
I'm
Henry.
Okay,
pal.
When
she
stops,
Go
to
the
middle
of
the
road.
-
Oh,
shit.
Where
is
she?
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
no!
Okay.
That
didn't
work.
Shit
your
pants?
So
did
I.
Okay,
this
is
her.
Make
it
look
good.
Give
me
your
wallet!
Okay,
haole,
what
do
you
think?
...eat
our
pineapple...
-
Take
it
easy.
Making
my
sister
Okay.
What's
that
have
to
do
-
Hey!
Hey!
Help
me,
please!
Yeah,
that's
right.
Take
that!
And
that!
And
that!
You
got
him.
You
got
him.
-
Are
you
okay?
Okay,
I'll
be
back.
No,
no!
I
think
he's
had
enough.
I'm
sorry.
My
eye!
-
You
got
him!
Oh,
Kamehameha!
He
learned
his
lesson!
-
What's
your
name?
-
You
did
good.
I'm
in
a
community-watch
program...
Oh,
you
crazy
bitch!
Yeah,
keep
running!
Okay,
okay,
he's...
He's
gone
now.
Not
her.
False
alarm.
Don't
worry,
I
called
the
cops
already.
Yeah?
You
all
set
for
this,
Mr.
Smarty?
-
Oh,
shit.
When
you're
finished
playing
your
...come
by
the
house.
Okay.
Oh,
boy.
There's
something
I
wanna
show
you.
We
figured
it
out.
She
only
sings
You're
kidding
me.
That
song?
That's
Mom
and
Dad's
song.
When
her
mom
was
alive,
...on
every
fishing
trip
I
went
on.
Yeah,
she
knew
it
would
make
me
...and
want
to
come
home
sooner.
I'm
seeing
a
new
side
to
you,
sir.
Let
me
ask
you
something.
What's
in
it
for
you?
I
don't
know.
Wouldn't
you
want
to
spend
Actually,
no.
She
sings
like
shit.
-
What?
What'll
happen
down
the
line?
...look
in
the
mirror
and
notice
You
know
something,
Henry?
I
worry
about
that
Pardon
me.
Sorry
to
interrupt,
but
I
noticed
we
...and
I
thought
I
could
sit
with
you,
...for
your
waffle
house?
...but
I
have
a
boyfriend.
So
I'm
sorry.
You're
making
up
a
boyfriend
No,
I'm
not.
What's
his
name,
then?
Ringo.
Is
his
last
name
Starr?
-
No.
McCartney.
-
Oh,
no.
No!
This
cop
is
writing
me
a
ticket!
Oh,
whoa,
whoa.
-
Wait,
wait,
wait!
I'm
coming.
The
tags
don't
expire
-
They
expired
May
of
this
year.
They
expire
May
of
next
year.
I
think
there's
been
-
I
don't.
I'm
not
paying
for
this!
Excuse
me.
Can
I
borrow
this?
Lucy,
let's
go
back
inside.
What?
What?
Having
a
bad
day,
Doug!
Sweetheart...
...these
are
from
the
accident.
Oh,
no!
I
can
feel
it.
You
were
in
the
hospital
I
have
to
talk
to
this
doctor.
You
have
heard
it,
sweetie.
I
have?
I'll
take
her.
I
have
to
hear
for
myself
too.
Doug,
just
take
this,
okay?
I
can't
look
at
it
anymore.
-
It's
gonna
be
all
right,
Luce.
Sweetie,
you're
sort
of
dating
him.
Sorry
I'm
not
better-looking.
What
else
happened
-
What
about
my
students?
-
Did
Alicia
marry
that
guy?
Doug,
did
you
win
I
didn't
know
there
was
gonna
be
Wow.
Do
we
have
sex?
No,
we
don't.
We
want
to.
Just
kidding.
So
you
guys
have
to
just
lie
Hey,
Lucy.
What
the
hell's
her
problem?
She
doesn't

so.
In
any
case,
Lucy,
...but

sorry,
dear.
But
it

Good

Thank

About
a
year.
Guess
you
won't
miss
days
like
this.
Well,
maybe
days
like
this
What
are
you
trying
to
say?
When
you
guys
tell
her...
...she's
not
just
finding
out
She's
finding
out
that
her
life
I
think
that
freaks
her
out
the
most.
-
You're
an
expert
now?
I'm
saying
I
wish
there
was
"Sorry
we
couldn't
trick
you
today.
-
You
want
a
broken
head?
No,
Daddy,
I
thought
Nobody's
gotta
break
my
head.
Oh,
don't
go
just
because
Good
night.
Sweet
dreams.
Very
funny.

Excuse

Lucy
Whitmore?
I
have

delivery
for
you.

A
delivery
for

Oh,

Who
are
they
from?
It's
a
secret
admirer.
-
Who's
your
friend,
Lucy?
We
just
met,
but
look.
I
have
a
secret
admirer.
Oh,
really?
What's
this?
It's
a
videotape.
A
videotape
of
what?
I
have
no
idea.
But
I
have
to
find
out.
Happy
birthday,
Daddy.
-
Thank
you,
sweetie.
-
What
are
you,
200
today?

What
are
you
doing?
If
it
doesn't
work,
Martha
Stewart
faced
charges...
Oh,
God!
Okay,
I
think
it's
on.
Go.
Go.
Aloha!
I'm
Henry
Roth.
We
met
here
at
the
Hukilau
Cafe
I
like
you
and
you
like
me,
most
days.
Every
day
is
different,
but
basically
Kikikoloko,
take
the
camera.
-
I
got
it.
Okay,
all
right.
The
part
of
you
in
this
reenactment...
...will
be
played
Aloha.
Sorry
about
your
brain.
I
had
a
accident
too.
Believe
it
or
not,
this
my
good
eye.
-
We
ready?
Hi.
I
like
that
waffle
teepee
Oh!
So
nice
of
you
to
notice.
I
would
love
to.
My
name
is
Henry,
by
the
way.
My
name
is
Lucy.
Smell
my
fingers?
Fish.
Right
on.
So,
Lucy,
I
work
at
an
aquarium.
Aquariums
make
me
super
horny.
That's
not
funny.
Sorry,
Mr.
Whitmore,
It's
very
late,
Come
on,
stop
with
the
licking!
Lucy,
I'm
sorry.
Anyways,
I
know
you
wish
I
was
I
wish
I
was
too.
But
the
good
news
is...
...so
many
people
out
there
Your
dad
and
Doug
and
a
couple
...who
have
a
message
for
you.
Lucy,
as
you
know,
That's
why
I
promised
her
that
Sometimes
life
isn't
very
fair...
...but
we
still
have
you.
Oh,
and
if
you're
wondering
about
...he's
okay.
Hey,
Lucy.
Just
so
you
know,
...I
became
governor
of
Hawaii.
No,
just
kidding.
I'm
too
smart.
Kualaliku!
Get
your
brother
So
whenever
you're
ready,
...and
answer
any
questions
...and
you're
the
best,
Lucy.
Aloha.
How
many
times
This
is
the
first
time.
Okay,
she
cried
for
about
an
hour.
I
bet
in
another
hour
she'll
be
ready
...get
her
life
back.
We
could
do
this
every
day.
We'll
leave
it
up
to
her.
All
right.
So
how's
the
cow?
Same
as
you.
Every
day
they
Wow,
look.
The
bark
is
healing.
You're
gonna
get
there.
I
never
hung
out
with
you
In
this
lighting,
man,
oh,
man,
...disgusting.
Yeah.
I
don't
know
how
you
get
me
to
fall
for
All
I
have
to
do
is
slide
on
...and
just
kind
of
wiggle
Why
couldn't
I
have
met
you
one
day
Don't
worry,
because
if
you
hung
out
...you'd
realize
I'm
a
bore.
-
Oh,
well,
I
have
news
for
you.
It
takes
less
than
one
day.
You
know
something?
Your
damaged
temporal
lobe
...and
I'm
gonna
get
you
for
that.
Now
you're
dead!
-
I
can't
believe
you're
pregnant.
-
And
I
got
her
on
the
first
try.
And,
Tammy,
you
are
so
thin.
Thanks,
Luce.
And
I'm
so
glad
you
finally
got...
...that
gender-reassignment
surgery,
Mahalo.
-
Here
you
go,
Lucy.
-
You're
welcome.
-
The
one
who
made
the
tape.
-
You're
my
boyfriend,
right?
So
every
day
you
help
her
...and
you
wait
patiently
for
her
...then
get
her
to
fall
in
love
Yes,
ma'am.
You
asshole!
You
don't
even
open
the
fricking
car
You're
in
trouble.
I
gotta
go
tinkle.
Okay,
so
tell
me
a
little
bit
more
Okay.
Well,
I've...
...won
over
seven
all-you-can-eat
-
Really?
And
I'm
a
ballet
dancer,
No,
what
do
you
want
to
know?
Do
you
love
me?
I
didn't
mean
to
put
you
on
the
spot.
I
was
just
asking
more
for
It's
to
keep
the
video
as
up-to-date
Sure.
Well,
love
is
a
very
loaded
word.
Let's
see.
I...
I
go
to
this
restaurant
every
morning,
And...
I
love
you
very
much.
Probably
more
than
anybody
could
And
how
do
I
feel
about
you?
You're
excited
about
And...
...you've
been
dying
to
make
out
Feeling
better
now?
Nothing
beats
a
first
kiss.
There's
nothing
like
a
first
kiss.
Nothing
beats
a
first
kiss.
That's
what
I've
heard.
Nothing
beats
a
first...
What
are
you
doing?
Nothing.
I
was
just
getting
You
were
going
for
a
feelski!
All
right,
I'm
sorry,
but
this
is
like
the
...and
they're
getting
blue.
I
know.
I
know.
I
mean,
I
really
don't
know.
For
me,
it
still
feels
like
the
first
time.
Okay,
let's
average
it
out
then.
It's
the
23rd
time
for
me
-
That's
about
our
12th
time.
Now,
Hawaiian
law
clearly
states
...I'm
entitled
to
unlimited
Why
didn't
I
meet
you
one
day
You
say
that
all
the
time.
You
want
to
meet
a
friend
of
mine?
All
right.
Jocko,
this
is
Lucy.
Wow!
Thank
you.
Nice
to
meet
you.
He
is
awesome!
He
is
so
smart.
Check
this
out.
Jocko,
what
does
-
Very
good.
Go
ahead.
Jocko...
...do
you
think
that
Henry
and
I
...to
the
next
level?
You
sure
about
that?
Do
you
think
I
should
bring
him
...and
take
advantage
of
him?
I
saw
that
hand
gesture.
-
And
I'm
glad
you
did
it.
-
Use
that.
-
Yeah.
They're
nodding
in
approval,
I
hope.
They
like
you.
Let
me
get
them
Mary-Kate,
Ashley,
get
a
life.
-
Oh,
they're
very
nice,
though.
Let
me
get
you
down
slow.
-
Thank
you.
All
right,
I
just
wrote
this,
The
Hukilau
was
the
place
Where
I
first
saw
your
face
We
liked
each
other
right
away
But
you
didn't
remember
me
Forgetful
Lucy
Has
got
a
nice
caboose-y
I
used
to
trick
you
into
pulling
But
my
favorite
time
was
when
you
And
we
drove
up
to
see
Dr.
Keats
And
found
out
why
Doug
always
Forgetful
Lucy
Cracked
her
head
like
Gary
Busey
But
I
still
love
her
so
And
I'll
never
let
her
go
Even
if
while
I'm
singing
this
song
She's
wishing
I
had
Forgetful
Lucy
Her
lips
are
so
damn
juicy
How
about
another
first
kiss
Can't
fall
asleep.
I'm
not
sleeping.
I'm
just
closing
my
eyes.
Well,
I'm
gonna
go
downstairs
then.
No,
no.
I'm
just
resting.
Lucy.
Yeah.
Will
you
marry
me?
-
Of
course.
Don't
forget
about
me.
Never.
Good
morning.
Oh,
shit!
-
Help!
Help!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Hey,
hey,
hey.
I
know
this
is
hard
for
you
...but
we
are
actually
We
have
been
for
a
while
now.
Oh!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!
If
I
was
lying,
You're
an
art
teacher
and
you
go
...and
you
make
waffle
houses
-
Stalker!
I
may
not
be
able
to
kick
your
ass,
Thanks,
buddy.
Little
Sammy
Sosa's
a
bit
shook
up,
She's
watching
the
tape
as
we
speak.
How's
my
temporal
lobe
Don't
worry.
You're
not
gonna
suffer
But
was
your
head
shaped
like
an
egg
Don't
make
fun
of
Henry.
Note
the
intense
overreaction.
-
Doug,
once
again,
off
the
juice.
It's
a
protein
shake.
Henry,
the
boys
tell
me
you're
setting
-
When
does
that
adventure
begin?
...ten
years
ago.
That's
when
I
started
All
I
know
is,
out
of
all
mammals,
I
have
the
first.
That's
my
joke.
Did
you
tell
Lucy
about
this
trip?
Well...
...actually,
there's
nothing
to
tell
I
mean,
Lucy
needs
me
here.
I'm
just
worried
about
...and
ruining
all
the
progress
I
know
you
think
I'm
crazy...
...but
I
think
deep
down
inside...
...she's
starting
to
remember
me.
That's
what
you
want
to
believe.
But
it's
never
gonna
happen.
Okay.
I
gotta
go
to
work.
Will
you
tell
her
I'll
be
back
later
See
you,
guys.
Don't
tell
anyone
He
could
go
to
the
moon
and
back
and
Sometimes
I
wish
my
wife
That
way
she
wouldn't
remember
...a
loud,
obnoxious
drunk
with
a
face
All
right.
There's
your
medicine,
Ula!
Get
back
to
cleaning
the
pool!
If
that's
one
of
your
special
brownies,
How
do
you
think
I
get
them
to
Okay,
Willie,
that's
it.
This
time
try
to
stay
clean
I
made
you
a
nice
anchovy
sundae.
Okay,
enjoy
that.
Henry?
-
Hey!
-
Oh,
it's
fine.
Don't
worry.
What
brings
your
royal
cuteness
I
needed
to
see
you.
Okay.
What
you
got
there?
It's
my
journal.
I
write
in
it
every
night.
-
Oh,
you
don't
like
the
video?
It's
just
sometimes
when
I
watch
it,
...from
someone
else.
...it's
like
I'm
telling
myself.
When
did
you
start
this
up?
Right
after
you
gave
me
the
video.
-
Really?
...and
meet
the
guy
that
makes
me
Well,
you
probably
thought
No.
I
was
nervous
because...
Because
I
came
here
You
had
plans
and
a
life...
...before
you
met
me
...is
to
make
me
fall
in
love
with
you.
That's
not
all
I
do.
Which
I'll
have
to
do
again
tomorrow.
I
look
at
my
dad
and
my
brother's
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
Be
some
No.
My
plan
is
to
erase
you
completely,
Why
are
you
doing
this?
Because
you
have
to
understand
Don't
you
want
to
have
a
career
I
asked
you
to
marry
me.
You
said
yes.
Kids?
Yeah,
I'd
love
to
do
it.
But
how
is
that
going
to
work?
I'm
gonna
wake
up
every
morning
with
...of
how
it
happened?
I
have
to
make
a
new
journal
But
before
I
do...
...I
really
want
you
to
read
I
will
read
about
it
tomorrow...
...when
you
forget
about
all
this
I'm
not
going
to
forget
it.
And
I'm
gonna
do
it
whether
I'll
be
at
my
house.
Okay,
type
this
one
in
there.
Saturday,
November
25th.
I
drove
out
to
Callahan
Institute
today
There's
one
about
me.
Reminder:
He
makes
funny
noises
I'm
gonna
miss
that.
You
sure
you
don't
want
me
-
We
can
skip
that
one.
We
made
love
tonight!
It
didn't
It's
not
all
about
how
long
you
go.
It's...
Actually,
let's
just
rip
that
out.
Well,
that's
that.
Henry,
wait!
Could
I
have
one
last
first
kiss?
-
I
ain't
gonna
do
this,
Marlin.
I'm
gonna
miss
you,
but
I
gotta
I'm
sorry
I
can't
take
you...
...but
you've
lived
here
so
long
you're
I
don't
feel
bad
for
you.
I
know
you
Candace
and
Bernice?
Candace,
Bernice
and
Rose?
Yeah.
I
fell
for
one
chick
and
I'm
losing
Okay,
baby.
I
love
you.
Thanks,
buddy.
Or
in
your
case,
a
Hefty
bag.
Well...
Okay,
you
guys.
Thanks
for
coming
Be
careful.
You
make
sure
your
father
doesn't
Thank
you,
buddy.
Bring
me
back
a
T-shirt.
Oh,
okay.
You
got
it.
Come
here.
All
right.
Love
you
guys.
My
shirt
size
is
medium
husky.
Hey!
Kikikuloa!
No
flippies
off
the
dock!
No!
All
right.
Let
the
master
Now
you
kids
go
down
there
Sure
you
don't
want
to
take
Doug?
Hey!
What
the
heck
I
spoke
to
the
harbormaster
and
he
...so
we
thought
we'd
wish
This
is
from
Nick
and
Sue.
That's
very
nice.
I
love
Spam
and
Reese's.
I
guess.
-
Doug!
-
I'm
sorry.
...how's
Lucy?
Actually,
she's
living
at
the
institute.
-
When
did
that
happen?
Said
she
didn't
want
to
be
a
burden
to
I
couldn't
talk
her
out
of
it.
She's
doing
really
great
up
there.
She's
teaching
an
art
class
In
fact,
she's
even
singing
again.
Hey,
look,
I
got
a
little
gift
It's
just
a
little
something
You
take
care
of
yourself
out
there.
-
I
will.
Henry
did
not
tell
me
about
you.
Your
fisherman
muscles.
Can
I
touch?
Sure.
Yes.
The
Beach
Boys?
How
nice
of
him
to
give
me
a
CD
...of
all
the
wonderful
times
What
an
asshole!
Oh,
why?
Why
would
you
do
this
to
me?
You
sick
bastard!
Oh,
my
God.
Is
he
trying
to
tell
me
something?
She
only
sings
on
days
She
remembers
me?
Holy
shit!
She
remembers
me!
Julia,
that
looks
great.
Excuse
me.
What
am
I
doing?
You're
painting
a
picture.
Oh.
Holy
crap!
I
suck.
Hey,
hey,
hey.
-
Can
we
help
you,
sir?
-
What's
your
name?
Dude,
he
forgot
his
name.
Just
go
on
up.
And
good
luck
Yeah.
Thank
you.
What?
Lucy!
Lucy!
-
Hi,
I'm
Tom.
Maybe
you
can
help
me.
Any
idea
where
I
can
find
her?
Hi,
I'm
Tom.
Oh.
Thanks
anyways.
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy
Whitmore...
...can
I
ask
you
a
question?
Do
you
have
any
idea
who
I
am?
-
No.
That
sucks.
-
What's
your
name?
Henry.
I
want
to
show
you
something.
Well,
yeah.
Hey.
Do
you
know
who
that
guy
is?
Dude,
I
don't
even
know
who
I
am.
Oh,
well,
you're
Pablo
Picasso.
-
Really?
This
is
my
studio.
I
don't
know
who
you
are,
Henry...
...but
I
dream
about
you
Why?
What
would
you
say
if
I
told
you
...used
to
have
a
lot
of
stuff
I
would
say
that
that
You
erased
me
...because
you
thought
you
were
...a
full
and
happy
life.
But
you
made
a
mistake.
Being
with
you
is
the
only
way
You're
the
girl
of
my
dreams...
...and
apparently
I'm
the
man
of
yours.
Henry.
It's
nice
to
meet
you.
Lucy,
it's
nice
to
meet
you
too.
Hi,
I'm
Tom.
Henry,
Lucy.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Tom.
Now
why
don't
you
come
back
in
Do
you,
Honah
Lee,
take
this
woman
...to
have
and
to
hold
...as
long
as
you
both
shall
live?
-
I
do.
Even
though
in,
like,
10,
15
years...
...she
could
possibly
let
herself
...sex
could
be,
like,
What
are
you,
nuts?
I'm
just
kidding,
Muumuu!
I
now
pronounce
you
man
and
wife.
Mazel
tov!
It's
very
cold,
so
when
you're
ready...
...put
on
a
jacket
and
come
have
Hey,
hey!
Good
morning,
Mrs.
Roth.
Go
say
hello
to
Mommy.
Hi,
Mommy.
That's
right.
Good
morning.
Oh,
my
goodness!
-
Grandpa's
here.
