MAN:
It's
Friday.
We're
at
the
hospital.
But
it's
not
a
hospital,
And
I
know
that
because
A
grizzly,
cooling
his
feet
in
a
stream.
And
all
of
a
sudden,
...and
I
can't
get
to
you.
But
the
bear
can.
And
next
thing
I
know...
...he
is
holding
our
beautiful
baby
boy.
And
here's
where
it
gets
odd.
Uh....
He
chews
the
cord.
But,
strangely,
I'm
okay
with
it.
That's
gotta
be
a
good
sign.
Theodore.
Loved
it.
But
remember
that
article
I
told
you
about?
I
don't
want
Teddy
to
think
he's
a
failure
Uh,
Arthur.
Oh!
This
was
tough,
because
it's
mythological.
But
"The
Name
Game."
Remember
that?
"The
Name
Game"?
"Art-Art-bo-Bart,
Banana-Fana-fo-Fart."
Brings
us
to
Casey.
This
whole
next
slew
of
names:
Casey,
Jordan,
Dylan,
Drew,
Taylor,
...are
all
names
that
Why
don't
we
just
cut
to
the
chase
DRIVER:
Yeah,

They

the
whole
underground
-That
so?

-...on
the
message
boards.
-Sorry.
Hey,
honey.
-Did
you
get
my
message?
I'm
about
halfway
through
it.
Ha,
ha.
I
didn't
want
you
to
think
I
was
You
considered
them
carefully.
It's
just
such
a
big
decision,
you
know?
I
know.
More
importantly,
Armani
Exchange.
I'm
talking
to
my--
Okay,
listen,
I'm
about
to
be
dropped
off.
-I
love
you,
can't
wait
to
see
you.
DRIVER:
Here

Yep.
DRIVER:
-Goddamn

Hey,
man!
You
just
hit
my
car!
-You
just
knocked
my
door
off,
man.
First
things
first,
DRIVER:
I'm
in
a
Town
Car!
Town
Cars
have
the
right
of
way
always!
That
right
there
is
some
serious
damage.
That
ain't
shit!
DRIVER:
My
brother-in-law
You
okay?
Sorry
about
my
friend.
You
smell
boozy
too.
Well,
we
haven't
been
drinking.
I
mean,
we
split
a
six-pack.
You
know
what?
My
father
always
had
a
saying:
When
a
day
starts
like
this,
That's
actually
incorrect.
-My
dad
used
to
say
it.
Everybody
wants
to
be
up.
It's
easier
as
you
go
down.
-Hey,
Shelby?
We
good?
-Okay.
PETER:
Excuse
me.
Sir?
I
can't.
You're

-I'm
gonna
have

search
it
real
quick,
sir.
Mad
magazine?
That's
cute.
That's
not
mine.
-This
is
your
bag?
Jackpot!
That's
definitely
not
mine.
-You
packed
your
bag
yourself?
I've
never
done
drugs
in
my
life.
Maybe
you
a
drug
mule.
-Do
I
look
like
a
drug
mule?
-You're
the
expert.
-Who
said
that?
My
eyes
said
something?
Did
my
mouth?
Do
you
mind
not
tossing
it
up
so
much?
Whoo!
Funky
motherfucker,
ain't
you?
You
are
so
inappropriate,
it's
crazy.
I
been
called
a
lot
of
things,
That's
some
fucked-up
shit,
yo.
Oh,
my
goodness.
Look
at
this,
Sonny.
Fancy.
Died
and
gone
to
heaven.
Are
you
not
aware
ETHAN:
Well,
hello!
How
you
doing?
What
brings
you
up
to
first

The

ETHAN:
Oh,
sorry.
I
was
in
low
class,
and
my
seat

It's
called

Lucky
day.
Nice
to
see
you.
Sorry
how
we
met,
but,
you
know....
Oh,
you
know
what?
-I
think
we
switched
our
bags
at
the
curb.
Your
bag
was
confiscated.
Marijuana
pipe.
Well,
that's
a
medical
apparatus.
-I
have
glaucoma.
Attention,
in
preparation
for
takeoff,
...and
if
you
have
a
laptop,
please
stow
it.
They
made
the
announcement.
-Yeah,
I
get
it.
-I'm
gonna
turn
it
off.
...because
they
know
terrorists
use
their
Shh.
Pst,
pst,
pst.
-That's
not
the
word
you
want
to
say.
-You
said
both
the
words.
-I'm
trying
to
tell
you
that
I
read--
Don't
say
words
ETHAN:
I'm
trying
to
be
informative.
Would
you
and
your
friend
mind
My
friend?
I'm
sorry,
I
need
you
Listen.
This
clown,
That's
not
true.
-That
was
an
accident.
And
he
had--
Federal
air
marshal.
What?
Why?
Drop
the
device.
-It's
not
a
device,
it's
a
BlackBerry.
What
are
you
gonna
do,
rent-a-cop?

It's
okay,
everyone.
He'll
be
fine.
It's
only
a
rubber
bullet.

Good
news,
Mr.
Highman.
-Oh,
good.
-Figures.
Now,
if
you
wouldn't
mind
just
signing
this.
So
I
don't
sue
you.
Just
saying
we
acted
in
accordance
-Sure
did.
If
you
put
your
address
there,
Let
them
land
at
LAX
and
I'll
pick
them
up
-ln
an
hour,
but
you
won't
be
on
it.
You're
on
the
No-Fly
list.
-Why?
-You
and
your
friend.
-The
gentleman
I
just
interviewed.
-Really?
-He
had
nice
things
to
say
about
you.
-Regardless--
I
have
a
pregnant
wife,
I
have
to
get
back.
-What
am
I
supposed
to
do?
Yes.
Well,
he

So
I
have
faith
in
you.
You're
free
to
leave.
SARAH

PETER:
It's
the
manageable
kind.
But
it
unfortunately
landed
me
What
did
you
do,
Peter?
Nope.
I
did
not.
I
was
cool,
I
was
completely
in
my
rights.
You
get
so
carried
away
sometimes.
How
are
you
gonna
get
home?
I
have
a
plan.
-But
my
wallet
is
traveling.
The
ID's
in
it,
I've
been
trying
But
I
am
exhausting
any

Hey!
I've
been
looking
all
over
for
you.
-Stay
away
from
me.
Honey,
this
might
all
be
solved.
Peter?
You
got
my
stuff?
-I
grabbed
it
before
they
zip-tied
me.
-You
get
my
wallet?
Where's
my
bag?
I
saw
your
bag,
but
I
didn't
grab
it
You
know,
I
had
this
thing
in
my
hand.
-What
kind
of
car
did
you
get?
...because
it's
in
my
wallet
Oh,
shoot.
What
a
bummer.
Yeah,
bummer.
Thanks
for
the
doll.
Fucking
idiot.
Hey,
you
wanna
ride
with
us?
No,
I'm
fine.
Look,
I
know
we
got
off
But
I
have
a
really
great
personality
Yeah,
I'm
sure
you
do.
I
got
90
friends
on
Facebook.
I'll
cover
expenses.
You
can
pay
me
back
PETER:
L.A.
It's
not
called
Hollywood.
Yeah,
but
I'm
going
to
Hollywood.
What's
your
name?
Peter.
My
name's
Ethan.
Ethan
Tremblay.
And
this
little
guy...
...this
little
butterball...
...this
is
Sonny.
And
we
would
be
honored
It'll
be
fun.

JK.
LOL.
HI.
"Hop
in."
Life's
weird,
isn't
it?
Buckle
up.
ETHAN:
You
have
any
brothers
or
sisters?
ETHAN:
You
have
a
dog?
Let
me
ask
you
this:
-Blue.
Wow.
-Do
you
like
hot
dogs?
I'm
more
of
a
corn-dog
man,
myself.
I
once
ate
a
foot-long
corn
dog
I'll
never
do
that
again.
-At
what
age
did
you
lose
your
virginity?
-I
was
9
years
old.
Great
gal.
Great
gal.
Sheila
Pimples.
I'm
getting
a
headache,
It's
just,
I'm
under
a
lot
of
pressure.
My
wife
and
I
are
having
a
baby.
-On
Friday.
That's
who
the
monkey's
for.
-Yep.
C-section.
-So
if
we
could
just....
Thanks.
I
was
supposed
to
meet
Luckily,
he
postponed.
-So
you're
an
actor.
Yep.
You
know
what?
In
fact,
I
wouldn't
mind
having
Hey,
hey,
hey.

My
apologies.
Look
at
this.
-Okay.
If
you'd
just
look
at
the
road.
-Oh,
your
headshots.
This
one,
this
is
a
laid-back
guy
...but
he
packs
a
piece.
-lnteresting.
This
one
was
my
father's
favorite.
He
says
it
really
showed
my
spirit.
And
I
agree
with
him.
PETER:
That's
a
gang
member,
And
a
nerd.
A
professor.
No.
I'm
Malcolm
X.
He
thinks
he's
human.
So
stupid.
What
brought
you
to
Atlanta?
-Business.
What
kind
of
business?
Architecture.
-How'd
you
get
into
architecture?
-Because
I'm
trying
to--
We're
gonna
be
traveling.
Okay.
Ethan,
what
brought
you
to
Atlanta?
My
daddy
died.
I
went
to
Atlanta
to
go
to
his
funeral.
Gee,
I
didn't
know.
I'm
sorry.
He
was
a
great
guy,
man.
He's
the
one
that
motivated
me
-TV?
Tough
business
to
break
into.
So
competitive.
I
have
a
friend,
he's
in
that
industry.
-Does
he
work
on
Two
and
a
HalfMen?
That's
too
bad.
...is
the
reason
I
wanted
-Right.
PETER:
We
are
just
outside
Birmingham...
...and
we
got
a
late
start,
so
we
will
Early
to
bed,
early
to
rise.
Long
1
6-
to
1
8-hour
haul,
-Eight
hours
outside
of
L.A.
If
we
could
stop
at
the
Grand
Canyon.
We're
not
going
to
the
Grand
Canyon.
That
would
be
easily
1
20
miles
off
That's
too
bad.
Daddy
would've
loved
Why
do
you
even
have
this?
Oh,
because
this
is
my
daddy.
These
are
his
ashes.
Why
are
your
father's
ashes
Because
he's
dead,
Peter.
-I
know.
I
know
that
part.
I'm
just
saying,
ETHAN:
You
broke
the
seal
You
poured
your
father's
remains
in
That's
the
dumbest
thing

God.
We
shouldn't
have
come
here.
I'm
allergic
to
waffles.
ETHAN:
We
need
to
make
a
brief
pit
stop
Actually,
our
next
stop
is
Shreveport.
-It's
1
0
minutes
away.
Why
you
making
a
pit
stop
in
Birmingham?
I
left
my
glaucoma
medication
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Your
what?
You
mean
your
weed?
-It's
medical
marijuana,
Peter.
-Why
do
you
make
everything
so
dark?
I'm
saying
I
really
don't
want
to
stop
I
didn't
want
to
play
this
card,
But
guess
what.
Guess
who's
got
Guess
who's
got
all
the
money.
Me.
Guess
who's
got
What
do
you
have?
You
have
a
strong
jaw,
fine.
But
I
gotta
tell
you
something,
mister.
Your
personality
needs
some
work.
My
God.
Now,
do
you
want
a
ride
-Yes,
please.
-Dad!
Okay.
God
Almighty,
holy
moly.
-Did
you
use
the
restroom?

SARAH:
Peter?
-Driving
how?
With
a
guy--
Please
don't.
You're
gonna
drive
2000
miles
Say
hi
to--
Sarah?
Hi,
this
is
Ethan
Tremblay.
I'm
fine.
How
are
you?
Good,
good.
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
And
I
will
have
him
Thank
you
so
much.
Hey,
Sarah?
One
other
thing.
I
got
this
killer
perm,
I'm
sorry,
did
you
say
Yeah,
a
perm.
Like
a
permanent.
PETER:
It's
heinous.
-Can
I
just
talk
to
my
husband,
please?
-She
wants
to
talk
to
you.
-So
that's
what
I'm
dealing
with.
PETER:

-Stop
worrying.
She's
very
legitimate.
WOMAN:
Fantastic.
ETHAN:
Honestly,
like
two
minutes,
okay?
-Hey.
-That
was
fast.
I'm
Ethan,
this
is
Peter.
-Are
you
a
cop?
Okay,
you
just
look
really
official.
And
you
know
if
I
ask
you
if
you're
a
cop
That's
a
myth.
That's
actually
incorrect.
-No,
he's
an
architect.
-Wait,
it's
a
myth?
Shit!
I
did
not
know
that
-That's
good
news.
-Come
in.
The
pharmacy's
in
the
kitchen.
Hey,
Peter,
can
you
watch
my
kids
just
for

quick.
Who
are
you?
I'm
Peter.
I'm
Alex.
This
is
Patrick.
Great.
Alex.
Mommy
gave
you
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
Alex
is
also
a
name
for
a
boy.
So
your
mom
kind
of
screwed
you.
Sorry,
my
hand
slipped.
That
one
I
just
got
in.
It's
an
Afghan
blend
You
know,
I'm
not
crazy
about
blends.
I
find
that
the
high
is
a
bit
shapeless.
A
purist.
Well,
that's
cool.
You'd
probably
love
Northern
Lights.
I
mean,
this
has
got
great
body.
Oh,
that's
just
Barry.
Hey,
Barry.
How
you
doing?
I'm
Ethan.
Listen,
did
you
remember
to
TiVo
HEIDI:
Yeah.
It's
on
there,
Nice
perm,
man.
Well
done.
Oh,
thanks,
bro.
Nobody
gets
perms
anymore.
Wait,
wait.
Don't
tell
me.
Is
that
a
perm?
Yeah.
It's
a
perm.
Yeah.

Oh,
my
God.
-Where
do
you
even
get
those
anymore?
I
was
just
kidding
about--
BARRY:
Excuse
me?
-Oh,
my
God.
Thank
God.
Because
I
was--
You
got
us.
You
got
us
both,
man.
You
know,
only,
like,
-That
was
good.
Very
good.
-Where
are
you
from?
-Is
that
where
you're
going?
Can
you
take
us
with
you?
No,
but
there's
an
organization
-What's
this?
Why
do
you
wear
it?
Because
I
wear
it.
-It
looks
stupid.
Just
take
your
hands
off
of
me.
Please
stop
doing
that.
Stop.
Please
stop
doing
that
now.
-Will
you
please--?
Is
that
right?
Well,
maybe
Reggie
Hey,
quit
it.
I'm
not
kidding.
[PETER
GRUNTS
You
okay,
bubba?
-What?
"Nothing"
is
right.

"Don
Corleone,
give
me
justice."
But
you
don't
even
have
the
decency
And
you
come
to
my
house...
...on
the
day
that
my
daughter
...and
you
ask
me
to
kill
someone.
For
money.
But
that
is
not
justice.
That's
amazing.
When
the
line--
The
murder.

Thank
you.
I've
been
Did
you
write
that
yourself?
No.
The
Mafia
wrote
it.
HEIDI:
Oh,
that
was
so--
Play
it
cool,
or
I'll
thump
you
again.
Sure,
sure.
You
all
set?
Yeah.
Good
to
go.
How
were
they?
Pretty
much.
Pretty
much.

I

they're
great
kids.

Good
luck.
Good

thing
is

First,
before
you
do
any
work
on
it,
Read
the

and
over
again.
PETER:
Card's
been
declined.
-What's
that?
-Oh,
gosh.
You
know
what?
I
bet
I
tapped
it
out
Great.
We'll

cash.
Sixty
bucks.
You

Sixty

food,
She's
the
only

in
town.
What
were
you
thinking
when
you
spent
-I
don't
think
in
those
terms.
I'm
not
an
accountant.
-Are
you
an
adult?
You
are
the
most
shot-out
How
have
you
made
it?
I've
done
that.
How
have
you
survived?
-Mostly
luck.
That's
what
I
thought.

-Fuck
me.
-We're
screwed,
Ethan.
-You
spent
all
our
money
on
weed!
You
know
what?
I'm
gonna
call
my
wife.
She
can't.
You
don't
have
an
lD.
She'll
wire
it
to
you.
-Let's
go.
Get
in
the
car.
Hold
on
one
second.
I'm
gonna
go

do
you

Here
we
go.
I
just
need
to
see
an
ID.
There
you
go.
Yeah,
this
doesn't
say
Tremblay.
It
says
Ethan
Chase.
Oh,
jeepers
creepers.
What
do
you
mean,
"he's
right"?
Ethan
Tremblay
is
my
stage
name.
-Your
stage
name.
What
is
your
real
name?
-It
doesn't
sound
like
an
actor's
name.
Ethan
Tremblay
doesn't
It
sounds
like
it
was
made
up.
Yeah,
I
made
it
up.
Ethan,
I
know
you
made
it
up.
Why
did
you
have
my
wife
wire
money
-I
wasn't
thinking.
Just
trying
to
commit
to
the
new
name.
Do
you
guys
wanna
discuss
this,
One
sec.
Do
you
have
anything
else
-Yes.
Of
course.
Yes,
yes.
What
was
I
thinking?
PETER:
He
has
two
names.
But
one
sec.
-What
the
fuck
is
this?
It's
a
photo
lD.
-No,
I
can't
accept
this
either.
Because
it's
a
picture
of
yourself.
...in
a
beautiful
turtleneck,
But
why
go
to
all
that
trouble
I
don't
know
why
you
would,
So
I
get
to
call
my
pregnant
wife
and
have
Start
this
whole
process
all
over
again,
...and
we'll
be
good.
-Absolutely.
We'll
have
to
do
that
tomorrow.
It's
6:35,
sir.
What
are
you,
my
boss?
I
say
when
we
close.
I
got
reservations
-You
have
a
reservation
at
Chili's?
That's
actually
smart.
I
mean,
Are
you
gonna
stare
at
me?
Do
your
fucking
job
-Keep
dreaming,
faggot.
No
way
in
hell.
Excuse
me,
Peter.
Sir.
I'm
sorry
about
my
friend.
We
really
just
...so
he
can
be
there
That's
such
a
sweet
story.
You
know
ETHAN:
Chili's?
How
about
I
call
my
sergeant
in
Fallujah
Aren't
you
closing?
He's
being
sarcastic,
Ethan,
...that
he's
a
"battle-hardened"
veteran...
...who
did
some
half-assed
tour
How
dare
you.
-Smooth
move,
that.
You
fucked
up.
Bigtime.
-I
fucked
up?
I
fucked
up
bigtime?
You
spit
on
your
own
window.
-Let's
get
out
of
here.
What
were
you
saying
about
-I'm
sorry.
I
had
no
idea.
-I'm
handicapable?
-How
could
you
know?
Can
I
tell
you
something?
Honestly,
LONNIE:
You
had
a
bad
day?
It's
about
to
get
a
whole
lot
worse.
-Okay,
now
put
that
away
before
you--
Oh,
I
know
that
shit
hurt,
huh?
-Ah.
Fucking
hick.
LONNIE:
You
wanna
fuck
up
my
dinner
plans,

I
call
that
little
move
"the
wheelbarrow."
ETHAN:
Peter,
get
up,
get
up.
-Courtesy
of
Western
Union,
huh?
-Oh,
where
you
going,
huh?
LONNIE:
Here
comes
the
train.

Time
to
roll
to
Chili's
And
chow
down
with
my
fuckin'
boys
You
okay,
buddy?
Don't
call
me
that.
Buddies
have
each
Peter,
that
man
was
handicapped.
You
can
call
me
Peter.
Or
Mr.
Highman.
I'll
call
you
Mr.
Chase.
Why
you
have
a
stage
name
is
beyond
me.
What
does
that
mean,
"really
an
actor"?
A
real
actor
is
someone
Well,
go
ahead,
give
me
an
action
to
do.
-No.
I
don't
want
to.
Okay.
I'm
Julia
Roberts.
You
have
terminal
cancer.
We're
engaged.
Break
the
news
to
me.
Julia
Roberts...
...as
you
know,
we're
engaged.
I
have
terminal
cancer.
Awful.
-What?
-I
thought
that
was
really
good.
I'll
give
you
one
more
shot.
You're
a
coach
with
a
spotty
career.
You're
down
31
points.
Bust
into
the
locker
room
All
or
nothing.
Action.
-Stupid.
That
would
never
be
in
a
movie.
Every
two
years.
Okay,
guys,
we
need
to
get
out
there.
Really
need
to
get
going.
You're
acting
like
a
girl
out
there.
Jackson,
come
on,
man,
-What
are
you,
a
girl
or
something?
She
wants
a
divorce.
-The
coach's
wife?
His
wife
calls.
She
wants
a
divorce.
Ring-ring.
Hello?
Hey,
fellas,
it's
gonna
be
a
minute.
Hey,
sweetheart.
What's
that?
No,
don't--
This
is
not
a
good
time.

Because
I
lost
my
dad,
I
don't
wanna
be
left
alone.
I
miss
him
so
much.
You
can't
do
this.
I
got
soda.
I
got
water.
Okay.
Great.
Thank
you.
-Crazy
rain.
I
think
we're
done
for
today.
Okay.
We'll
kill
it
tomorrow.
But
this
is....
So
tell
me
something
about
your
dad.
He
was
a
toll-booth
operator.
Really?
He
was
a
real
people
person.
He'd
come
home
every
night
and
he'd
laugh
Because
he
enjoyed
talking
to
everybody
Oh.
What
about
you?
Where's
your
dad?
Uh....
No
idea.
ETHAN:
1
977.
Ooh.
Ouch.
Yep.
Came
into
my
room,
said,
I
need
you
to
wake
me
up,
And
I
was
ecstatic
because
I
didn't
even
know
I
existed
It
was
just
a
big
deal.
I
was
so
excited.
I
set
the
alarm
clock.
I
could
barely
sleep.
When
it
went
off
at
5:30,
...I
gingerly
wake
him
up.
He
smiled
at
me.
First
time
I
ever
saw
him...
...uh,
smile.
But
he
had
his
bags
packed
...and
he
picked
them
up,
...and
drove
away.
Last
time
I
ever
saw
him.

It's
so
funny.
Oh,
my
gosh.
My
dad
would
never
do
that.

What's
that
sound?
What
sound?
Mm.
No,
it
stopped.

-Okay,
it's
back.
What?
Why?
This
is
how
I
go
to
sleep.
Oh,
don't,
don't,
don't.
Come
on,
dude.
I'm
right
here
next
to
you.
Just
shut
your
eyes,
Peter.
They're
closed.
The
sound.
Just
bear
with
me.
-How
long
is
this
gonna
take?
If
you
keep
interrupting
me
...but
it
usually
just
takes
Is
that
all?
Your
fucking
dog's
doing
it
too.
Sonny!
Stop!
Sonny,
no.
Stop.
Good
boy.


PETER:
Don't
even
think
about
it.
Please.
Don't.
Intolerable.
lntolerable.


Son
of
a
bitch.
Goddamn
it.
No.
Great.
This
is
great.
Fuck.
Don't.
Okay.
We
are
gathered
in
the
presence
...to
celebrate
the
passing
of
one
Mr.--
Chase.
Or
a.k.a.
Tremblay.
May
he
forever
reside
and
dwell
Amen.
You
know,
I
just
wanna
offer
...as
to
why
you
wound
up
It's
not
your
fault.
It's
your
kid.
He's
an
incredibly
difficult
person
In
fact,
I
don't
know
how
or
why...
...you
didn't
just
strangle
him

Hey,
buddy.
Forget
something?
No.
I
got....
I
got
coffee.
Dunkin'
Donuts.
Thought
maybe
you
left
me.
I
picked
up
breakfast
-Why'd
you
leave
my
stuff
out
here?
-That
makes
sense.
Want
me
to
drive?
-It
is
your
shift.
PETER:
-Okay.
Come
on,
Sonny.
Sonny,
come
on.
I
was
thinking,
"There's
no
way
We've
had
our
bumps
in
the
road,
-Oh,
please,
no.
It's
not
my
car.
Yeah.
Come
on.
Get
in,
Sonny.
You
know,
my
mind
works
And
I
thought,
"God,
why
would
You
have
a
nice
shower?
-Yes,
excellent.
You
know,
rest
areas
The
nicest
showers.
This
coffee's
hot.
-It's
hot
coffee.
-Have
we
crossed
the
Mississippi
River?
The
Mississippi
River
was
the
river
That's
too
bad.
Would
have
been
a
great
sendoff
Put
his
ashes
in
the
old
river.
Let
the
ashes
Spend
Mardi
Gras
there.
-I'm
gonna
get
some
shuteye,
okay?
...and
women's
titties.
-Did
I
snore
last
night?
Sorry.
I'm
a
deep
sleeper.
You
know
when
they
say,
"That
guy
I've
actually
slept
I
also
fell
asleep
during
a
job
interview
I
didn't
sleep
last
night.
You
should
have
masturbated...
...because
I
had
a
glorious
orgasm

And
a
sun
to
maybe
dissipate
Shadows
of
the
mess
you
made


Hey!
Get
up!
Ethan,
wake
up!
Goddamn
it!
Son
of
a
bitch.
No!

PETER:

What
happened?
I'll
see
if
the
rental
agreement's
in
the....
You
know
what?
I
have
coverage.
That's
good.

-Stay
away
from
me.
Am
I
okay?
Do
I
look
okay?
I
have
a
broken
arm,
three
cracked
ribs.
I
have
seven
stitches
in
my
armpit.
No,
not
okay.
-Peter,
I
am
terribly
sorry.
Sonny's
all
banged
up.
I'm
a
wreck.
Doctor
said
I
was
in
such
a
deep
sleep
-I
told
you
I
was
a
deep
sleeper.
Did
the
doctor
say
it
is
not
advisable
I
was
just
trying
to
rest
my
eyes
But
seriously,
next
time

PETER:
One
sec.
My
actual
friend.
He's
come
to
pick
me
up.
-Oh,
good.
Shotgun.
Just
me.
We're
done.
And
by
the
way,
But
just
so
my
conscience
is
clear,
...why
you're
not
coming
with
us,
okay?
It's
not
because
you
got
me
kicked
off
Not
because
you
stood
by
as
I
had
my
ass
I
am
certainly
not
leaving
you
here...
...because
you
almost
got
me
killed
I
am
leaving
you
here
I
despise
who
you
are
at
a
cellular
level.
I've
heard
that
before,
-Great.
Now
hear
this:
Beware.
I'm
warning
you,
The
streets
are
not
paved
with
gold.
...of
imbeciles
like
you
"Pray
you,
avoid
it."
Did
you
get
that?
That
was
Shakespeare.
Yes,
I've
heard
of
him.
And
by
the
way,
it's
Shakesbeard.
Let
me
give
you
a
little
bit
Nobody
who
calls
themselves
"Hollywood"
That
I've
never
heard
before.
Sonny,
you
will
be
sorely
missed,
[DOG
WHIMPERS
-I
have
never...
...in
all
of
my
23
years!
-Come
on,
let's
get
out
of
here.
-We're
moving
out.
-What's
going
on?
Who's
the
dude
you
yelling
at?
He's
nobody.
A
guy
I
was
traveling
with.
He
looks
sad
as
shit.
-And
you
just
spit
on
his
dog.
I
was
seeing
red
because
he
has
a
way
of
-You
wanna
leave
him
here?
-Pete,
how
long
have
I
known
you?
-Twenty
years.
Your
energy's
off.
You
don't
wanna
mess
So
whatever
you
need
to
do
to
fix
between
Trust
me.
Make
it
right.
Hollywood,
come
here.
-You
see
what
I'm
working
with
here?
Okay,
I've
calmed
down
a
bit.
-You
ready
to
apologize?
-Wait.
Oh,
no.
Pete,
Pete,
relax.
Fix
it.
First
of
all,
I
have
no
recollection
Now,
if
you're
gonna
travel
...I
gotta
give
you
a
couple
guidelines.
If
you
ask
me
a
single
question,
-So
don't
do
that.
Do
you
understand?
Number
two:
...other
than
the
fact
that
...I
will
disembowel
you.
Make
sense?
-Somewhat.
Three:
If
you're
allergic
to
waffles,
-Then
don't
take
me
to
a
Waffle
House.
-Relax.
-Hold
Sonny.
Hand
me
that
dog,
I
will
rip
it
in
half.
You
better
check
yourself
And
then,
his
fault,
-A
No-Fly
list?
You?
Yeah.
Just
got
worse
from
there.
He'll
just
start
beating
off.
-What?
-No
lotion?
Is
that
a
drainage
ditch
coming
up?
Yes,
it
is.
-Would
you
mind?
Real
hard.

Ethan,
you
all
right?
Yeah,
we're
good.
Next
time,
don't
tense
up
your
body.

-There's
another
one
up
here
too.
PETER:
Yes,
you
can.
I
prefer
my
pickup
anyway.
-I'll
ship
it
back
as
soon
as
I
get
there.
You
will?
What
are
you
doing
in
L.A.?
I'm
not
gonna
miss
But
let
me
ask
you:
Doesn't
it
burn
you
up
I
mean,
that
body
was
so
flawless,
How
did
you
know
we
were
She
told
me.
Coffee?
Sure.
What
is
going
on?
What
are
you
talking
about?
What's
with
all
these
stories
They
used
to
date
in
college?
It
was
like
20
years
ago.
Yeah,
but
come
on,
you
don't
see
it?
This
guy's
good-looking.
-You
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
I
think
there's
something
going
on.
DARRYL:
Here
you
go.
DARRYL:
What's
that?
DARRYL:
Oh,
yeah,
that
was
February.
She
didn't
tell
you?
She
mentioned
that
she
bumped
into
you.
That
we
were
throwing
them
back.
Just
sort
of
reliving
some
things,
-Real
good
girl.
Fantastic.
February.
lsn't
that
about
-No
questions.
Nine.
Where
you
at
with
the
names?
-She
said
that?
-You
and
his
wife
exchange
e-mails?
What
else
do
you
exchange?
PETER:
Ethan.
-What
is
he
talking
about?
This
is
not
bothering
you?
The
e-mails--
Each
other's
ejaculate?
What?
It's
when
your
urine
turns
white.
Okay,
new
rule:
You
can't...
...say
a
fucking
word.
This
is
horrible.
It
tastes
like
cat
litter.
I
think
it
tastes
delicious.
You
should.
I
was
all
out,
PETER:
That's
his
dad,
it's
his
dad.
Fine.
I'll
buy
some
other
coffee.
His
dad
is
the
coffee.
He
passed
away
and
his
remains
Get
him
the
fuck
out.
-I
get
it.
I
know.
It
took
eight
minutes,
right?

Oh,
God!
So
stupid!
Where
are
the
ashes?
PETER:
-It
was
an
accident.
-Where?
There's
the
coffee
machine
right
there.
There's
the
can,
there's
the
coffeemaker.
We're
gonna
retrieve
this.
Can
we
just
calm
down?
Let
me
take
it.
ETHAN:
PETER:
Oh!

It's
okay.
Come
here,
I'll
help
you
pick
it
up.
There
we
go.
Get
it
back
in
there.
I'm
sorry
we
drank
your
father.
It's
okay.
Are
you
all
right?
Are
you
sure?
Yeah,
there's
plenty
of
him
still
in
here.
Darryl
only
made
three
cups
of
coffee...
...and
I
think
there's
about
eight
cups
Great.
At
least
he
tasted
good.
Not
bad.
Yeah,
strong.
He
was
full-flavored.
Robust
blend.
He
really
enjoyed
coffee.
And
in
the
end,
Kind
of
circle
of
life.
Lion
King.
All
that.
I'll
tell
you
what,
the
moratorium
on
Fire
away.
Okay.
-How's
your
arm?
Do
you
think
Darryl
slept
with
your
wife?
-No.
I
mean,
why
would
he
lend
you
...and
give
you
all
that
Because
he's
my
friend.
That's
why.
Have
you
ever
been
I
have
a
question
for
you.
How
did
those
three
questions
I
was
thinking
about
your
wife
and
Darryl,
What
their
baby
would
look
like,
Then
I
thought,
And
I
thought,
"Well,
I
should
maybe
-...when
we
get
to
California--"
Next
question,
please.
PETER:
It's
your
ever-faithful
and
adoring
husband
Just
checking
in.
Weird,
it
went
to
voicemail.
I
actually
talked
to
him...
...and
he
told
me
about
the
lovely
weekend
Didn't
jibe
with
the
way
...so
maybe
with
all
your
e-mails
...you
can
get
your
story
straight.
If
there's
something
you
need
to
tell
me
...if
I'm
gonna
have
a
surprise
...I
would
just
appreciate
it
Call
me.
-Was
I
right
or
was
I
wrong?
The
Darryl
thing,
your
wife,
She's
sleeping.
I
left
a
message.
And
the
casual
manner
with
which
you
So
if
you
wouldn't
mind
not
doing
that
-I
got
some
snacks.
Unfortunately,
I
need
you
to
drive.
I'm
not
supposed
to
operate
I
will
tell
you
this:
If
you
blink,
if
you
even
look
like
you
...I'm
gonna
put
hands
on
you.
I'm
gonna
Wrap
that
thing
around
your
neck
Seems
a
bit
drastic.
Take
off
your
glasses.
I
bought
them,
It's
night.
You're
driving.
You
act
like
you've
never
been
-Remove
them.
-Jolt
Cola?
Drink
it.
-You're
not
the
boss
of
me,
you
know.
Please.
Attaboy.
By
the
way,
when
I
fell
asleep...
...that
was
a
one-time
occurrence.
-I
know
what
I'm
doing.
I'm
a
grown
man.

That
way,
Sonny
could
get
stoned.

Am
I
stoned?
Do
you
feel
stoned?

No
matter
how
he
tried
And
the
worms
ate
into
his
brain
Hey
you
Together
we
stand
Divided
we
fall
PETER:
Well,
it
turns
out
the
cheese
grater
Ha,
ha!
The
show
has
heart.
How
do
you
know
so
much
about
this?
I
run
a
fan
site
for
the
show.
Not
official,
I
started
it
at
an
internet
caf.
Used
to
go
in
there
and
wash
my
feet.
What
was
the
site
called?
It'sRainingTwoAndAHalfMen.com.
Wow.
That
is
sublime.
Can
I
retract
every
Thank
you,
Peter.
That's
very
sweet.
-Hand
me
a
Bugle.
Thank
you.
-Will
you
feed
one
to
the
hound?
Are
we
on
the
highway
still?
ETHAN:
PETER:
ETHAN:
You're
getting
paranoid.
PETER:
It
looks
like
a
border
crossing,
-Oh,
Lord.
Gosh.
I
thought
that
said
Texaco.
-Okay,
we're
fine.
ETHAN:
What
are
you
gonna
tell
them?
All
I'm
gonna
do
is
say,
-And
we're
gonna
ask
to
turn
around.
Okay,
I
need
you
to
be
quiet.
Won't
that
be
suspicious
-Let
me
handle
everything.
ETHAN:
Here
we
go.
ETHAN:
I'm
sorry.
Hello.
The
weirdest
thing
happened.
Are
you
guys
American
citizens?
Yes.
Yes,
we
are.
-The
both
of
you?
Can
I
see
your
passports?
We
don't
have
passports.
The
thing
is,
Somehow,
I
must
have
taken
If
we
could
just
maybe
turn
around
You
wanna
turn
around?
Yeah,
it
was
a
mistake.
What's
wrong
with
your
friend?
Peter,
don't
do
that.
Why
are
your
eyes
so
glassy?
No,
I
have
glaucoma.
What
about
your
friend,
Answer
the
man.
Do
you
have
glaucoma?
What
about
the
dog,
Because
his
eyes
are
glassy
as
fuck.

Shut
off
the
car.
Wait
right
here.

-Did
I
blow
it?
You
are
smooth.
-Wow.
God,
my
heart
was
in
my
throat.
Could
you
hand
me
my
father's
ashes?
Wow.
What's--?
What
are
you
doing?
PETER:
We
took
the
wrong
exit,
No
matter
how
many
times
you
ask,
You
sound
like
Jason
Bourne,
man.
You
don't
know
where
you're
going.
I
wanna
speak
to
I'm
American,
I
have
rights.
-Oh,
yeah,
sure.
Hey,
Ramon.

Hello,
sir.
-How
can
I
help
you?
What
are
you
laughing
about?
AGENT:
You
bring
drugs,
you
party.
I've
never
heard
of
an
American
This
would
be
an
isolated
incident.

Well,
I
apologize.
I'm
sorry.
You
attempted
to
transport
drugs
...dude.
This
is
serious
shit.

Okay,
Daddy.
There.



Shit!
Son
of
a
bitch!

Stop!
Help!

Oh,
shoot.
PATROLMAN:
Pull
over!
Pull
the
car
over!

Hold
on,
Sonny,
it's
about
to
get
rough.
Oh,
God.

Ethan?
Hollywood!
Oh,
crud.
Peter?
Peter,
are
you
okay?
PETER:
ETHAN:
I
had
no
idea
where
I
was
going.
Then
I
see
you.
Remember,
-But
you
didn't
look
like
you.
-God,
you
looked
crazy!
-That's
why
I
got
the
scarf
on
my
head.
-You
were
a
Comanche
warrior.
-It
was
the
greatest
ever.
Don't
move.
Ready?
What?
Oh.
That's
your
new
headshot.
-Yeah.
God,
the
pain
is
extraordinary.
-Will
you
e-mail
that
to
me,
please?
Okay.
All
right.
Just
not
too
much,
Peter.
Rescue.
A
daring
rescue.
-You
came
back
for
me.
You're
so
brave.
I
made
you
a
promise.
I'm
getting
you
home
safe,
okay?
-I'm
gonna
kiss
you.
-I'm
gonna
give
you
a
smooch.
-Come
on,
baby.
-Give
me
a
little
smooch.
Sick!
You
got
it.
-Everything's
up
and
down
with
you.
No
way
I'd
see
my
kid
There's
no
way.
I
love
you,
dude.
I
love
you
too,
Peter.

Oh,
dear.
Sweetheart,
I
am
so
sorry.
You
know
how
I
get.
You
knew
about
that.
I
know,
and
I
know
it
has
nothing
to
do
Just
listen
to
me,
okay?
Don't
say
anything.
I
would
never
betray
you,
We're
a
family
now.
Nothing
else
matters.
-You're
so
right.
-I
love
you,
baby.
Wake
up.
Ethan.
Check
it
out.
PETER:
ETHAN:
You
sure?
I
could've
sworn
PETER:
Nope.
Not
correct.
Very
old.
Grand
Canyon.
Known
fact.
Peter,
I
have
a
photogenic
memory.
Ethan,
I
promise
you.
It's
old.
It's
the
Well,
I
know
it's
not
the
Hoover
Dam,
Also
incorrect.
It's
magnificent
though.
-You
didn't
have
to
stop,
you
know.
Let's
hit
the
road.
We've
got
time.
What
are
you
doing?
Relax.
We
should
just
stick
with
the
plan,
But
I
thought
this
was
part
of
the
plan.
What
am
I
missing,
Ethan?
What's
really
going
on?
When
I
said
the
Grand
Canyon
"Too
bad,
it
would've
been
perfect."
When
we
passed
"Too
bad,
Dad
loved
titties
and
jazz."
I
just--
You
know,
we
got
stuff
to
do
I
know
it's
hard
to
say
goodbye.
And
I
didn't
know
your
dad,
but
from
what
He
was
a
cool
guy.
I'm
just
saying.
I'm
just
suggesting.
If
you
got
it
in
you...
...he
deserves
a
grand
gesture.
Okay.
Come
on,
Sonny.
Come
here,
sweetheart.
Yeah.
Dad,
you
were
like
a
father
to
me.
And...
...I
don't
know
how
But
I
know
that
you'll
look
after
me
I'm
gonna
make
you
proud,
Dad.
Okay.
I
promise.
I
love
you.
Say
hi
to
Mom.
Bye,
Daddy.
He
was
a
great
guy.
You
would've
Hey....
There's
something
I've
been
wanting
I
kind
of
want
to
get
it
off
my
chest.
I....
I
ditched
you
at
the
rest
stop
-What?
So
wrong.
Why
would
you
do
that?
Because
I'm
a
pig.
I'm
an
asshole.
Well,
you
know
what?
I
think
that
says
more
So...
...just--
You're
something
else.
Thanks.
That's
a
load
off.
Well,
there's
something
I've
been
Shoot.
I'm
not
really
23
years
old.
I
know.
It's
okay.
The
other
thing
is...
...Peter...
...I
have
your
wallet
What?
What
are
you
talking
about?
Peter...
...okay,
listen.
Why
would
you
do
that?
I
saw
it
on
the
plane
I
was
feeling
vulnerable
And
I
just
didn't
wanna
go
across
country
-It's
all
here.
All
my
money,
all
my
credit
cards.
Everything
I
needed.
This
whole
time.
-You're
okay
with
it?
What
are
you
gonna
do?
-Okay.
-Thanks,
Peter.
Okay.
Okay.
-You
get
Sonny,
and
I'll
drive.
-After
I
fucking
kill
you!
You
little
thief
prick.
Die,
thief.
You
thief.
Calm
down!
Peter,
count
to
1
0.
It'll
help.
Aah!

The
phone's
ringing!

-Hello,
dear.
-What?
-How?
I'm
at
the
Grand
Canyon.
What?
Did
you
just
say
Peter?
Mom?
He's
at
the
Grand
Canyon.
Oh,
my
God.
-Who
was
it?
-I
thought
we
were
having
a
C-section.
You
stepped
on
my
Capezios.
Let's
go!
Good
God,
you
maniac.
Not
gonna
make
it.
That's
great.
We
are
gonna
make
it.
There's
no
"we."
Don't
say
"we."
-Okay,
look--
No.
Me
first.
No.
You
can't.
I
told
you
I
saw
red.
I
told
you
I
was
gonna
put
hands
on
you.
And
I'm
sorry
you
were
But
I
warned
you.
-I'm
sorry.
But
in
the
future,
...if
we
get
into
a
fight,
-That's
how
I
make
a
living.
Okay?
Still
bleeding.
Check
the
glove,
there's
probably
Clean
yourself
up.
Check
this
thing
out.
Oh,
shoot.

I
can't
believe
I
did
that.
Sorry,
Peter.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
didn't
think
it
was
loaded.
Pull
over.
-No,
I
wanna
keep
going.
-I
don't
want
to.
No,
it
didn't
happen,
-I'm
in
shock!
ETHAN:

Don't
panic!
Don't
panic!
Don't
panic!

-Oh,
no.
It's
right
there,
yep.
-I'm
so
sorry.
We
gotta
stop
the
bleeding.
-Turn
around?
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
Turn
around!
Stay
still.
I
got
it.
You're
fine.
Right
here.
It's
deep.
We're
going
to
a
hospital.
Oh,
God!
What
did
I
do?
-Stop
freaking
out.
It's
okay.
Let's
do
a
little
acting
exercise
like
we
did
You're
a
sergeant,
...but
you
promised
me
that
you'd
get
me
Okay.
Action.

-Peter.
I
puked
on
the
wound.
I
know.
It's
okay,
buddy.
I
need
you
to
drive,
but
we
gotta
go.
Okay?
Come
on.
Get
in
the
back
seat,
private.
-Excellent.
-Yeah,
let's
roll.
-Figured
it
out
yet?
Your
son's
about
to
be
born.
-I'll
know
it
when
I
see
him.
No.
Not
naming
my
son
Don't
listen
to
him,
Sonny.
He
loves
you.
Sonny,
no!
Sonny.
Sorry.
We're
heading
home!
I
made
it.
-Okay,
come
on.
Oh,
the
monkey,
the
monkey,
Sonny,
we'll
be
right
back,
okay?
Got
it.
PETER:
Thank
you.
I
have
an
expectant
father
PETER:
Then
we
cut
left.
-Shoot.
I
forgot
to
crack
a
window
for
Sonny.
-The
door's
off
the
car,
Ethan.
See?
Together
we
think
of
everything.
Okay,
here
we
go.
-Let's
get
you
cleaned
up.
Right?
Give
me
these
guys.
It's
all
about
to
go
down.
Give
you
a
vest,
cover
up
the
blood.
Have
I
told
you
that
I
love
your
perm?
Thank
you,
Peter.
Look
who's
come
around.
PETER:
No,
come
on,
come
on.
-Ma'am.
Put
your
handcuffs
in
your
pocket.
-Here's
the
Rally
Monkey.
-Ohh!
Sarah?
-Sarah?
-You
hear
that?
SARAH:
Peter!
Darryl.
What
the
fuck?
FATHER:
Whoa,
whoa.
Whoa,
hey.
You
gotta
go,
man.
You
gotta
go.
SARAH:
Peter!
What
the
fuck?
Baby!
Baby,
you
made
it!
-Jesus,
Peter,
are
you
okay?
No,
I
just
lost
a
little
blood.
-Ohh!
Oh,
my
God!
Relax.
We
need
to
find
a
hospital,
okay?
-Who
are
you?
-I'm
your
husband's
best
friend.
Nice
to
meet
you
too.
Okay.
-Breathe.

ETHAN:
Look
at
that
baby,
right?
You
see
it?
PETER:
Hey.
What
do
we
got?
-Look
what
you
made.
Ohh.
He's
really
cute.
That's
a
handsome
boy.
-It's
a
girl,
actually.
-Yep.
Dr.
Greene
says
it
happens
all
the
time.
You
know,
ultrasounds
Right.
-Little
Rosie.
Little
Rosie
Highman.
No,
it's
such
a
pretty
name.
Sarah
thought
you'd
be
okay
with
it.
-When
did
you
talk
to
Sarah?
-You
cut
it?
I
got
to
cut
that.
-No.
-You?
I
kept
a
little
bit
of
it
-It's
good
for
sore
ankles
and
stuff.
Wow.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
Ethan,
I
dreamt
this.
-This
is
crazy.
I
had
this
strange
dream...
...that
was
today.
And
there
was
a
bear.
What?
-And
the
bear
chewed
the
cord.
That's
spot-on
if
you
think
about
it.
You
know
what
I
mean?
-I
don't
get
it.
What--?
It's--
It's....
It's
gotta
be
a
good
sign.
I
guess
I'll
maybe
leave
you
...and
I
got
that
meeting
with
that
agent.
-It's
Friday.
Yeah,
good
luck.
Oh,
I
wanted
to
give
you
this.
It
has
all
of
my
information.
-Mm-hm.
-Or,
you
know,
I
could
babysit.
I'll
keep
it
handy.
We
had
a
crazy
few
days.
That
was
nuts.
We
should
do
it
again.
Okay.
-Sure.
-If
I
don't--
I
might
e-mail
you.
No,
no,
e-mail's
fine.

-Bye,
Sonny.
Feel
free.
-It's
been
a
real
pleasure,
Peter.
Thanks.
Hey.
Ethan.
Welcome
to
Hollywood.
What?
You
want
me
I
was
just
saying
The
city
welcomes
you.
Just
make
sure
you
call
me
tomorrow.
I'll
call
you.

MAN:

Hello?
Oh,
hey.
I'm
Stu,
the
tutor.
No,
I'm
his
father.
Oh.
I'm
Stu,
the
tutor.
Right.
Have
you
been
smoking
pot?
No,
sir.
Not
at
all.
Perhaps
you're
smelling
my
cat.

ALAN:
Your
cat?
You
know
what,
he's
really
funny.
Don't
get
crazy.
Come
on.
You
love
him.
I
survived
him.
There's
a
difference.
Um,
uh,
Charlie,
this
is
Jake's
tutor,
Stu.
-Hey.

CHARLlE:
ETHAN:
Like
clockwork.
I
told
him
SARAH:
If
she
says
his
name,
I'll
freak
out.
ETHAN:
Hummus?
Again,
no
thank
you.
You
got
any
more
pot?
Not
for
$9
an
hour
I
don't.
I
mean,
I
don't
know
