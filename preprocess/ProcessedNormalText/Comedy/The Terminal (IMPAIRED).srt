out
a
way
How?
Well,
we
have

here
who
have
a
credible
fear
If
we
can
establish
this
fear
with
you,
then

forced
to
bring
you
to

judge
-
Asylum?
Unfortunately,

you'd
get
before
Yes,
and
we
would
have
no
choice
but
to
let
you
go
for
those
six
months.
You
would
be
free
to
wait
But,

it
or
not,

But,
you
only
get
to
go
-
Fear?
-
Fear.
From
what?
That's
the
best
part.
It
doesn't
matter
what
you're
afraid
of.
So
I'm
going
to
ask
you
one
question,
if
you
give
me
the
correct
answer,
I
can
So,
I
answer
one
question.
Go
to
New

So
you're
afraid.
-
From
what?
You're
afraid
of
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No,
I
am
not
afraid
from
Krakozhia.
I'm

-
Damn.
-
Why
you
do
this?
This
is
the
only
fun
I
have.

barbecue?
Let
me
get
this
straight.
I
take
four

flights,
fly
27

straight
and
now
you
tell
me
