SETH:
I'm
so
scared,
James.
JAMES:
Be
quiet.

You're
breathing
really
loud.
Don't
breathe
through
your
mouth.

Now
you're
doing
loud
I
don't
know
where
else
Is
that...


JAMES:
Oh,

There's
a
fuckin'
A
demon?
What
the
fuck
happened
to
you
guys?
It's
Jonah!
He's

Oh,

supposed
SETH:
Yeah.

Motherfucker.
JAY:

SETH:
He's
gonna
be

My
side's
good.
All
right,
Fuck!
Come

Okay!
This
shit's
cray
cray,
guys.
I
mean,
it's,
like,
It's,
like,
like
that
means
there's
a
God.
Right?
I
haven't
led
my
life
as
though
Who
fuckin'
saw
that
coming?
I'd
say
95%
of
the
planet.
Jesus
fucking
Christ,
man.
You
might
want
to
stay
"Jesus
fucking
Christ"?
Why
can't
I
say
that?
One
"Thou
shall
not
take
the
name
Jesus
isn't
the
name
God
is
name
of
the
Lord.
Jesus,
God,
it's
all
the
same.
It's
the
Trinity.
It's
like
Neapolitan
ice
cream.
I
don't
even
know
what
Guys,
I
think
this
is
sort
of
bullshit,
I
can
look
at
each
one
of
you
I'm
good.
We
bring
joy
to
people's
lives.
Yeah,
but
we
don't
We
get
paid
handsomely,
much
higher
It's
not
like
it
was
just
We've
worked
really
Yeah,
pretend
like
You
sitting
on
the
beach,
you
in
your
drawers,
talking
about

I
think
God
made
a
mistake,
and
left
I
mean,
He's
got
a
lot
It's
not
an
oversight,
We
got
to
face
facts.
We're
here,
and
Why
are
you
so
sure?
I've
done
things,
man.
I...
I
gouged
a
man's
eyeballs
out.
What
the...
Craig.
It
was
a
fuckin'
bar
fight.
It
was
a
bad
foosball
game.
He
said
I
didn't
call
spinneys,
He
got
all
in
my
face,
and
I
smashed

...and
the
but
then
I
was,
like,
fuck
it,
It
was
fucked
up.
That
shit
happens.
I'm
saying,
that's...
I
got
to
admit
something.
I,
uh...
I
fucked
Lindsay
Lohan.
She
was
fucked
up.
It
was
at
the
Chateau
Marmont,
and
she
kept
banging

She
kept
calling
That's
fucked
up.
Yeah,
I
said,
"Call
me
See,
that's
what
We've
all
done
bad
shit,
We've
done
more
bad
shit
than
it's
time
to
pay
the
piper.
JAMES:
Whoa,
shit!
Something's
wrong.

God
did
this.
He
gave
us
light,
and
then
He
took
it
away.
You
hear
that?
It's
the
soundtrack
Damn,
I
wish
there
was
something
I
know
what
we
can
do.
JAY:
The
fuckin'
stench.

Jonah
Hill?
Jonah?

Jonah
Hill.

Demon?
Yes?

That's
not
good.
Jay,
you
fool.
I
say
unto
thee,
the
power
of
Christ
Oh,
does
it?
The
power
of
Christ
Does
it,
Jay?
The
power
of
Christ
Is
the
power
of
Christ
compelling
me?
The
power
of
Christ
compels
you!
Guess

SETH:
Jay,
you
That's
your
fuckin'
plan?
You're
gonna
I
would
assume
they
did
It's
a
movie!
It's
a
fuckin'
training
manual.
I
say
unto
thee,
the
power
of
Christ
The
power
of
Christ
The
power
of
Christ
Geez,

hurts
a
little
bit.
It's,
