Relax,

It's

Hey,

Undoubtedly,
this
was
some
residual

Doc,
calm
down.
It's
me.
It's
Marty.
It
can't
be

I
sent
you
back
to

That's
right,
but
I
came
back
again
You
fainted.
I
brought
you
home.
This
can't

You
can't

It
doesn't
make

MARTY:
I
am

it

You
always

it's

You're

Come

I'll

Come

Let's

What's

What's

Come

surface.
Of

Ice!
We'll
wait
until

MARTY:
Winter?
What
are
you
saying?
All
right.
Let's
just
think
We
know
it
won't
run
under
its
own
power.
But
if
we
could
figure
out
a
way...
...to
push
it
up

That's
it.
How
fast
can
she
go?
I

you

it's

it

Ninety?
Tarnation.
Just
a
little
bet
he
and
I
have,
that's
all.
Theoretically

could
it
be
done?
I
suppose,
if

straight

you
weren't
hauling
no
cars...
...and
if
you
could
get
the
fire
hot
enough.
I'm
talking
about
hotter
than
the
blazes
It
might
be
possible
to
get
her
up
that
fast.
When
does
the
next
train
come
through?
Monday
morning
at
8:00.
Here.
This
spur
that
runs
It's
a
long
stretch
of
level
track
This
is
where
we'll
push
the
DeLorean
Funny.
This
map
calls
Clayton
Ravine
That
must
be
the
old
Indian
name
for
it.
A
long
run
that
goes
...over
near
that
Hilldale
housing
development.
Right,
but
according
to
this
map...
...there
is
no
bridge.
MARTY:
We
can't
wait
for
this
thing
to
get
finished.
DOC:
Marty,
it's
perfect.
DOC:
MARTY:
DOC:
It's
safe
and
still
in
use.
As
long
as
we
get
the
DeLorean
...before
we
hit
the
edge
of
the
ravine...
...we'll
instantaneously
arrive
at
a
point
We'll
have
track
under
us
MARTY:
What
about
the
train?
Too
bad
no
one
will
be
around
to
see
it.

CLARA:
Help
me!


CLARA:
Hurry!
DOC:
Jump!


Thank
you,
sir.
You
saved
my...
...life.
Emmett
Brown
at
your
service,
Miss...
Clayton.
Clara
Clayton.
Clara?
What
a
beautiful
name.

DOC:
May
I
help
you
inside
with
these?
That
won't
be
necessary.
I
can
take
care
of
it.
-You've
done
more
than
enough
already.
She
says
it's
fine,
and
we
have
to
get
going.
Ma'am,
good
luck
Clara.
I'll
straighten
everything
out
Don't
worry
about
that.
That
would
be
very
gentlemanly
of
you,
You
know,
I'm
almost
glad
Otherwise,
we
might
never
have
met.
I
suppose
it
was
destiny.
Thank
you
for
everything.
You're
quite
welcome.
I
will
see
you
again,
won't
I?
Of
course.
You'll
see
lots
of
me.
I'm
the
local
scientist,
I
mean,
blacksmith.
What
sort
of
science?
Astronomy?
Chemistry?
Actually,
I'm
a
student
of
all
sciences.
Doc,
we
have
to
get
going.
Yes.
Excuse
us,
Clara.
We
have
to
get
going.
Toodle-oo.
What
do
you
mean,
I
might
see
her
again
just
in
passing.
Did
you
see
the
way
she
was
looking
at
you?
She
did
have
quite
a
scare,
right?
Miss
Clayton
almost
ended
up
Holy
shit.
-They
say
she
fell
in
there
100
years
ago.
-That's
this
year!
We
all
have
teachers
we'd
like
to
see
Great
Scott!
Then
she
was
supposed
to
go
over
Now
I
may
have
seriously
altered
history.
Look,
Doc,
what's
the
worse
that
can
happen?
So
they
don't
name
the
ravine
after
her.
Let's
get
the
DeLorean
ready
I
wish
I'd
never
invented
It's
caused
nothing
but
disaster.
Doc,
this
is
Marty.
Do
you
read
me?
Over.
Check,
Marty.
MARTY:
Great.
These
things
still
work.
All
right.
Once
more,
-I
apologize
for
the
crudity
of
this
model...
All
right.
Tomorrow
night,
Sunday...
...we
load
the
DeLorean
...by
the
abandoned
silver
mine.
The
switch
track
is
where
the
spur
runs
...three
miles
out
to
Clayton...
Shonash
Ravine.
The
train
leaves
the
station
We'll
stop
it,
uncouple
the
cars,
...borrow
the
locomotive
and
use
it
According
to
my
calculations
we'll
reach
...the
edge
of
the
ravine,
...and
coast
safely
across
the
completed
bridge.
What
does
this
mean?
"Point
of
no
return."
That's
our
fail-safe
point.
Till
there,
we
have
time
to
stop
the
locomotive
But
once
we
pass
this
windmill,
DOC:
Here
you
go.
DOC:
All
right,
you
all
set?
DOC:
Train
pulling
out
of
the
station!
Coming
up
to
the
switch
track!
Stop
at
the
switch
track!
Throw
the
switch!
Pull
up
to
the
DeLorean!
Pushing
the
DeLorean...
...up
to
88
miles
per
hour!

It
couldn't
be
simpler.

CLARA:
Emmett?
It's
Clara.
Quick,
cover
the
DeLorean!
CLARA:
Hello.
DOC:
This
is
quite
a
surprise.
I
hope
I'm
not
disturbing
anything.
We
were
just
doing
a
little
model
railroading.
When
my
bags
were
thrown
from
the
wagon...
...my
telescope
was
damaged.
Since
you
mentioned
an
interest
in
science...
...I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
repair
it
for
me.
I
would
pay
you,
of
course.
I
wouldn't
think
of
charging
you
for
this.
Let's
have
a
look
at
it.
CLARA:
...if
you
move
it
this
way
the
image
turns
fuzzy.
See?
But
if
you
turn
it
the
other
way...
...then...
Everything
becomes...
...clear.

I
could
repair
it
right
away
Tonight
is
the
town
festival.
I
wouldn't
dream
of
having
you
work
You
are
planning
on
attending,
aren't
you?
-Actually,
ma'am...
In
that
case,
CLARA:
Mr.
Eastwood.
Thank
you
for
taking
care
of
my
telescope.
DOC:
You're
quite
welcome.
It's
a
nice
telescope.
Ladies
and
gentlemen...
...as
mayor
of
Hill
Valley...
...it
gives
me
great
pleasure
...to
the
people
of
Hill
County!
May
it
stand
for
all
time!
Tell
me
when,
gentlemen.

CROWD:
Three!
Two!
One!
Now!


MAYOR:
Let
the
festivities
begin!
In
a
way,
it's
fitting
that
you
and
I
It's
too
bad
I
didn't
bring
my
camera.
Ready,
gentlemen?
The
only
problem
is,
Smile,
Doc.



What
great
music!
Yeah,
it's
got
a
beat,
and
you
can
dance
to
it.
Step
right
up
and
test
your
mettle
...from
Col.
Samuel
Colt's
Patent
...of
Hartford,
Connecticut.
Now,
take
this
model,
for
example.
The
new,
...selling
to
you
tonight
for
the
low
price
of
$12.
-Good
evening.
You
look
very
nice.
Thank
you.
Would
you
like...
-Would
you
care
to...
Young
man,
you
want
to
give
it
a
try?
MARTY:
No,
thanks.
Doc,
this...
Son!
-Sonny
boy!
Son.
SALESMAN:
I
just
told
you
that
even
a
baby
SALESMAN:
Surely
you're
not
afraid
to
try.
Come
on,
then.
Now,
young
man,
what
you
do
...squeeze
off
a
round.
Right
on
out
there
and
be
real
smooth.
That's
the
way
you
do
it.

-Can
I
try
that
again?
Tell
me
one
thing.
7-Eleven.
Buford,
you
sure
that
blacksmith
Sure
he's
here.
Everybody's
here
tonight.
You'll
have
to
check
your
firearms

TANNEN:
Who's
gonna
make
us,
tenderfoot?
TANNEN:
Marshal
Strickland.
If
you
can't
read
the
sign,
Pretty
tough
hombre
when
you're
pointing
Just
like
you,
I
take
every
advantage
I
can
get.
You
gonna
check
your
iron?
I
was
just
joking
with
your
deputy.
Of
course,
I'm
gonna
check
my
iron.
TANNEN:
We
all
were,
weren't
we,
boys?
DEPUTY:
Tannen.
Your
knife,
too.
