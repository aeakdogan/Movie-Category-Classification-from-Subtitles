little
more
than

smidge.
Calm

Okay?
Oh,

All
we're
doing
is

Okay,

It's
an
orca

he's
breaching
What
the
fuck?
Uh-oh,
something
wrong?
Yeah!
Something's
wrong.
You
said
"a
smidge

This
is
not

Smidge

No?
You

me
moving
enough
weed
Okay?
They're
using
a
goddamn
bucket
You

sound
surprised?
Relax!
Everything's
gonna
be
fine,
man.
I

He'll
let
you
breeze

I'll
even
buy
you

Can
I
change
the
subject
for
a
second?
If
you
get
back
and
see
the
sculpture...
you're
gonna
look
at
it
and
be
like,
The
balls
are
the
only
part
Everything
else
is
perfect.
But
I
made
the
balls

Thank

You
wanna
get
us

Namaste.
CASEY:
Whoa.
I
think
Snoop
Dogg
would
fuck
this
fridge.
At
least
it
keeps
it
fresh.
Well,
as
long
as
no
one
sets
foot
looks
through
a
window,

...we
should
be
pretty
good.
We're
totally
fucked.


DAVID:

like
arresting
anybody...

right.
Ha,

Seems
to
be
working
out.

DAVID:
Oh,
Shit!

Seriously.
God...!
Was
this
part
of
your
plan,
David?
Damn
it.
-
Wait,

are
we
gonna

Good
idea.

Really?
Good
plan.

ROSE:
And

Ugh.
CASEY:
ROSE:

Why
are
you
defending

I'm
not

0h!
One
more
sec,
okay?
Hold
on,
EDIE:
you
can't
use
a
maxi
pad,
So
my
friend
bought
me
a
box
of
tampins.
And
I'll
tell
you,
I
had
-
It
would
just
stick
halfway
out.
-
It
was
just
like
a
Roman
candle.
And
that
is
how
I
found
out
-
That
was
such
a
detailed
story,
Edie.
You
gotta
do
a
one-woman
show.
So,
what's
your
story,
David?
-
What
do
you
mean?
Ah!
Honey,
tell
her.
And
don't
leave
out
DAVID:
Okay.
All
right.
Where
did
we
first
meet.
Um...
It's
great.
Well,
that
would
have
been
when
Rose
-
Ah.
That's
right.

I
remember
watching
her
through
the
Wait,
you
were
spying
on
me?
Now,
hon,
just
because
you've
heard
it
doesn't
mean
you
should
interrupt.
All
right.
Proceed.
But,
yeah,
I
was
spying
on
her.
She
was
unloading
this
U-Haul
I
wanna
go
help
her,
but
I
don't
wanna
come
you
know,
I'd
like
to
hit
on
her
And,
uh...
she
was
wearing
these
little
navy
No
pockets
on
the
back,
And
this,
uh,
Tom
Waits
T-shirt.
I
was
like,
"Oh,
that's
cool."
Because
I
love
Tom
Waits.
And
she
just
looked
beautiful.
If
you're
into
that
kind
of
mean,
So,
anyway,
uh...
she
starts
to
bring
up
this
really
big
And
I'm
like,
"Okay,
here's
my
shot."
and
I
help
her
with
it.
She
looks
at
me
and
goes:
-
She
just
snaps
at
me.
Next
thing
you
know,
it's
a
tug
of
war...
pulling
it
back
His
fat
fist
-
But
it
was
an
accident.
Okay.
Honestly,
I
really
think
Yeah,
because
that
painting

My
grandfather
painted
that
painting.
And
it
was
my
favorite
thing
So
we
get
in
this
screaming
And
everybody
comes
out
I
mean,
from
that
moment,
Oh,
man.
-
And
then
you
fell
in
love.
Oh!

right?

We
were
just
treating
it
like

Extra
credit.
nothing
ruins
your
life
like
children.
Yeah.
And
it
also
sends
that
message
-
Yeah,
anal.
-
Neither
makes
a
baby.
Anyway,
I'm
so
sorry,
Edie.
that
we
would
treat
it
like
a
real
baby
Got
used
to
it.
Sorry.
ROSE:
I
think
that
would
scare
anybody.
She's
very
emotional.
You
should
have
Oh,
stop
it,
Don.
I
love
that
whale.
Well,
who
loves
campfire
games?
EDIE:

Ladies
and
gentlemen,

Our
usual
guests

their
place

year
we
have
the
Let's
get
this
party
started

I
fought
the

and
the
law
won.
It
always
does.
DON'.
I
needed
to
steal
some
money
I
fought
the
law
and
the
law
won.
Now
just
the
Millers.
ALL
:
I
fought
the
law
and
the
law
won
I
want
you
to
imagine
you
committed
a
felony,
and
you're
standing
out
in
the
sun
breaking

I
fought
the
law
and
the
law
won.
-
All
right,
that's
great.
DAVID:
That's
fun.
Great
song.
Great
choice.

Great,

We
wait
until
they
fall
asleep

-
What?
No.
Jesus.
-
What
the
fuck's
wrong
with
you?
I
wasn't
saying
to
do
that.
I
didn't
say
that.
You
thought
I
was
gonna
say
Who

think
I
am,
Scarf
ace?
DON:
Herbert
Walker
Bush!
Clowns.
Clown
sandwich.
Don't
lock
the

in
the

What
I
was
gonna
say:
We
sneak
then
we
take
the
RV
back
to
the
shop
and
I
Ah.
Got
it.
-
The
Earth!
The
Earth
is
on
fire!
EDIE:
Uh...

Plain
and
simple.
Al
Qaeda!
Al
Qaeda!

It
was
"plain
and
simple."
-
See,
this
was
a
plane,
and
then
this
w...
That
is
so
clever.
Gosh,
I
thought
it
was
really
good.
I'm
a
terrible
drawer,
so...
-
Great,
because
you're
up
next.
-
Passing
the
baton.
ROSE

DAVID

-
Draw
your
brains
out.
-
A
slash.
Guns
and

What
is
that?
That's
a...
Kenny,
CASEY:
String.
-
Rocket.
It's
a
rocket
or...
This
is
really
stupid.
DAVID:
Is
it
a
bad
drawing,
Kenny?
-
it's...
It's
a
big
dick.
Those
are
balls.
It's
a
big
black
dick!
It's
a
drawing.
It's
a
big,
big
black
cock!
Black
Cock
Down!

It's
a
skateboard.
-
It's
a
skateboard,
great.
-
It's
a
big
black
skateboard.
Of
course.
It's
very
clear.
Its
wheels,
so
I
didn't
see
it
Black
Cock
Down?
Black
Cock
Down?
Nice
job,
Meryl
Streep.
Not
my
fault
that
Kenny
can't
draw.
DAVID:
Don't
you
pick
on
Kenny.
ROSE:
Nothing
about
that
You
leave
him
alone.
-
You
guys,
come
here.
-
What's
going
on?
ROSE:
Aww.
DAVID:
Uh-oh.
-
Guess
I'm
not
the
best
drawer.
-
I
knew
that
was
a
skateboard.
-
I
don't
know
where
the
confusion
was.
Yeah.
I,
um,
really
like
your
family.
-
They're
different.
Yeah,
no,
I
get
what
you
mean.
-
She
wants
him
to
kiss
her.
CASEY:
She
does,
right?
or
an
alien,
you
know,
or
something.
Right.
That's
what
I
meant.
Um...
But
also,
you
know,
I
You
know,
um...
Not
that
I
wanna
be
your
daddy.
DAVID:
He's
talking
too
much.
Uh,
well,
good
night.

-
I'll
see
you.
Fucking
hug.
Okay.
And,
uh,
Melissa?
-
Yeah?
Um,
you
know.
Can't
see
them
coming.
Good
tip.
That
poor
kid.
Who?
I
said
you
should
go...
Me?
What
the
hell
am
I
gonna
say?
Talk
to
him
about
guy
stuff.
-
Jesus
fucking
Christ.
DAVID:
Hey,
man,
how
you
doing?
-
Anybody
sitting
here?
Well,
good,
good,
good,
good.
So,
urn...
I
saw
what
just
happened
-
Oh.
You
know,
you
don't
have
to
be
scared
to
I
mean,
you
damn
near
sucked
a
guy's
dick
That's
not
funny,
David.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
It
was
a
bad
joke.
Ahem.
You
wanna
know
something
I
used
kept
me
from
-
Yeah.
-
Count
to
three?
-
That's
your
big
advice?
Count
to
three?
I
mean,
if
you
ever
wanna
kiss
a
girl
Actually,
if
you
get
scared
of
anything,
and
then
do
it.
Because
if
you
take
too
long,
you
over
think
Trust
me,
it'll
change
your
life.
I
guess
that
makes
sense.
-
Thanks.
And,
you
know,
if
you
have
any
other
about,
like,
the
birds
and
the
bees...
who
puts
what
into
where,
just
don't
hesitate
to
ask,
okay?
_Ql<ay-_Ql<ay-
-
Good
talk.
DAVID:
Oh,
my
back.
So
old.
KENNY:
Yeah.


Wait.
You
go
in.

Fuck
you.
This
was
your
idea.
Why
are
you
yelling
at
me?
I
am
not
yelling
at
you.
Okay.
Okay-
Watch.
Bin
Laden!
What's
happening?
Is
it
raccoons?
God.
You
were
right
about
them,
Edith.
-
No.
I'm
so
sorry.
This
is
completely
explainable.
-
A
misunderstanding.
-
You
just
have
to
understand
something.
We
have
never
done
anything
like
this
with
Uh-huh.
That's
no
judgment
on
you.
-
I
own
a
vibrator.
-
Awesome.
The
darn
thing's
made
in
China,
but
when
you've
been
married
this
long
So,
of
course
we've
discussed
a
scenario
Yes.
And
tonight
when
you
brought
up
DON:
Well,
we
got
it.
Our
vibrator
is
named
"Joe
Morgan."
We
were
picking
up
-
EDIE:
Same
page.
We're
very
flattered
by
this,
but
right
I'm
not
sure
I'm
really
ready
for
it.
Got
it.
Totally
understood.
Not
a
problem.
We
just
had
to
ask.
So...
EDIE:
Wait.
I
have
an
idea.
Okay.
Maybe
I
could
take
I
mean,
my
mouth
is
for
my
marriage.
But
I've
never
touched
I
would
be
okay
with
that.
Yeah.
EDIE:
Oh,
great.
Rose?
-
There
you
go.
-
Are
you
okay?
-
Mother
to
mother,
is
this
okay
with
you?
-
Are
you
sure?
-
Shall
we?
Okay.
-
Okay,
Don,
are
you
watching?
Okay.
Uh,
wow.
My
heart's
pounding
-
Ahem.
So
I
guess
we're
swinging.
Ooh.
Ha,
ha.
EDIE:
Hello.
Ha-ha-ha!
Okay,
I'm
just
gonna
do
it
real
fast.
-
There
they
are.
-
Wow!
Wow!
EDIE:
Don,
are
you
looking
at
this?
-
This
is
a
miracle.
-
Would
you
like
to
feel
my
breasts?
-
You're
right.
-
A
little
roughhouse?
-
Are
you
okay
down
there?
Have
fun
tonight,
kids.
ROSE:
Awesome.
Mwah,
mwah,
mwah!
Thank
you
so
much.
ROSE:
Good
night.
That
was
great.
Great.
What
now,
genius?
-
Tell
me...
What?
I
just
got
earfucked
in
a
tent.
If
you
let
her
finger
bang
you
Oh,
really?
Why
don't
you
go
and
then
you
get
the
keys?
Okay,
look.
First,
unlike
you,
I
only
That's
kind
of
a
personal
rule
I
have.
-
Yeah,
and
secondly...
And
secondly...
I
don't

of

around
like
Okay.
Um...
Well,

Had
sex
before.
Shocker.
Kissed

wanna
be

let
me
make
one
thing
clear.
This
isn't
one
of
those
moments
and
realizes
she's
been
in
love
with
him
You're
my
fake
brother
so
this
is
for
you

What
is?
Oh.

really
weird.

Sorry.
That
was
okay.
Now

Tongue.
I
can
do
that.
Too
much
tongue.
Too
much
tongue.
Right.
Too
much...
Less
tongue.
That
was
good.
All
right,
now
this
time,
I
want
you

okay.

running
off...
-
Yeah?
things
bedroom-wise
between
me

...haven't
been
a
real
five-alarm
fire
of
late.
Now
that
I'm
not
working
as
much,
we
have
-
...but
our
matches
are
wet.
-
If
you
catch
my
drift.
Yeah,
the
matches
are
genitals.
I
get
it.
No,
I
was
talking
about
our
passion.
Right.
Sorry,
sorry.
Of
course.
-
That's
okay.
That's
all
right.
So
we've
been
looking
for
new
ideas...
and
she
read
on
the
internet
-
Don,
you
don't
need
to
share
that
with
me.
Okay,
as
long
as
you're
comfortable.
-
I
need
your
advice,
David.
You
and
Rose
seem
hotter
for
each
other

sexual
congress
in
a
wool
sock.

We
do?
You're
like
newlyweds,

We
are?
what
do
you
do
to
keep
things
exciting

Hmm.
Right.
-
And
by

hole
you
mean...
That's
genitals.
Okay.
Um.
Yeah,
um,
my
secret?
Uh...
Well,
you
know
what
I
do,
Don?
I
just
treat

No
kidding?
Like
she's
a
dirty,
dirty
stripper.
Okay.
Heh-heh-heh.
Dirtier
the
better.
Heh.

Heh,

I
am
so
sorry
that

just
won't
come
out
of
that
bedroom.
You
know,
she's
been
sick
to
her
tummy

think
it
was
something
that
she
ate.

Sure
will.

out?

What?
Where
did
it
happen?
On
my
fucking
balls.
On
my
balls,
Oh,
God.
Let
me
see.
No.
No
fucking

You're
not

it.
Come

I
can't
help
you
unless
you
Kenny,
will
you
just
man
up
We've
all
seen
a
dick.
DAVID:
All
right,
let's
see
it.

What?
What
is
it?
-
I
can't
look.
-
Is
it
bad?
-
Dude,
it's
really
bad.
-
Have
you
seen
what
that...
Look.
-
You're
going
to
a
hospital.
How
bad
is
it?
You're
okay.
Rub
some
dirt
No.
You're
going
to
see
a
doctor.
No
fucking
way.
He's
not
going
to
a
hospital.
Trust
me.
Kenny
is
fine.
I
can't
feel
my
bingo.
-
Goddamn

Kenny.

Go
grab
him.
Grab
him!
Yeah,
this
is
David
Mille...
David
Clark,
Yes,
I'll

Who's
my
big
black
and
white
baby?
Yeah.
You
are.
Yes,
you
are.


-
Yellow-ski.
Where
the
fuck
have
you
been?
David!
You're
alive!
Cool.
Ask
the
real
Pablo
Chacon.
I'm
not
gonna
make
excuses.
It
was
kind
of
a
dick
move.
-
"A
dick
move"?
A
dick
move!
Little
bit
of
a
dick
move.
Well,
tell
you
what.
I'm
not
driving
All

you
understand
me?
Sounds
like
you're
Fucking
right
I
am.
And
I'm
kind
of
turned
on
right
now.
You
make
a
good
case
for
hazard
pay.
How
much?
Oh,
I
don't
know,
-
How
about
that?
Fucking
right,
it's
done.
Good.
But
I
need

No
problem.
That's
fine
with
me.
Where

you,
anyway?
We're

Hi.
Hello,

Oh,

What's
the

He's

us.
I'm
afraid
your
son
had
a
pretty
severe
Ooh.
Too

He's

lot
of
pain

Why?
Please.

Go

my
son
and
bring
him
Stop

Doctor,
thank
you.
-
Thank
you
very
much.
-
What
is
your
fucking
problem?
Are
you
crazy?
It's
only
a
few
hours.
No,
we're
not
fine.
Okay?
We'll
be
dead
in
a
few
hours.
Look,
here's
what
I
say
we
do,
all
right?
We
leave

So
you're
saying

We

with
him
here.
Okay.
You
know,
if
we
leave
Kenny
here,
Ah.
No.
I
don't
know
where
I
was
going
Seriously.

-
What's
that?
CASEY:
Don't
answer
it!
It's
for
me!
What's
up,
dawg?
Not
much,
dawg.
What's
up
with
you?
Here
to
pick
up
Casey,
I'm
awake
and
I
speak
English,
-
What's
your
name,
man?
Again,
I
do
know
what
you're
saying.
But
I
appreciate
you
continuing
-
Hi!
Bye.
We're
gonna
go.
-
Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
I
have
just
made
lunch.
-
When
are
you
coming
back?
DAVID:
Once
Kenny
is
ready,
we're
out
of
here.
We
will
leave
with
or
without
you.
Okay,
fine.
That's
totally
fine.
Wait.
Come
here.
-
Are
you
kidding
me?
Would
you
please
have
a
seat.
What
is
going
on?
So,
Scottie
P.,
-
Oh,
Mom!
I'm
rocking
that
Monkey
Maze,

What
the
hell
is
the
Monkey
Maze?
but
for
little
kids.
You're
working
at
the
fair.
You're
a
carny.
No,
I
drive
a
motorcycle.
-
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
What
about
you
guys?
Where

Uh,

Colorado.
Yeah,
I
love
my
Rockies,
Oh,
you
like
the
Rockies?
-
Uh,
no,
the
mountains.
Hey,
those
are
cool
tats,
man.
Oh,
for
real.
Thank
you,
bro.
-
What's
this?
The
one
right
there?
DAVID:
Uh-huh.
That's
my
credo.
"No
ragrets."
Mm-hm.
How
about
that.
-
You
have
no
regrets?
-
Not
one?
I
wish
I
did.
To
talk
about
something.
Not
one
regret,
huh?
That's
how
I
been
living
my
whole
life.
I
went
to
a
tattoo
artist,
I
was
like:
"This
how
I
live.

And
he
did
it.

Not
even
a
single

love
all
the

what
I'm
saying?

you
count

you
have
any
questions
for
us,

what
I

gonna
be
fine.

cannot
believe

is
concerned
about

What?

just
want

was

taking
it
back.
I'm
sure

Jimmy
He
seems
like
a
very
good
guy.
Well,
he's
not.
He
left.
Maxed
out
all
my
credit
cards,
jetted
out
of

He
stole
my
favorite
mug.

was

I'm
really
sorry
about
that.
That
sucks.
That's
what
you
get
Ah,
come
on.
You're
a
lot
more
than
that,
Rose,

-
What?
What's
your
real
name?
Sarah.
With
an
"h"?
Yep.
Right
there
at
the
end.
It's
the
best
way
to
spell
it.

That's
what
my
mother
thought.
Heh.
Well,

not
my
real

Really?
Wow.
So

a
hair...

or
put
behind
the
ear?
Guess
we
could...
tuck
it
back
there.

Whoa.
What's
going
on
in
here?
We
should
ask
you
the
same
thing,
-
We've
been
worried
sick.
Why
are
you
guys
talking
like
that?
Shit,
is
someone
here?
Yeah!
Yeah,

We
didn't
know
if
you
were
dead

You
couldn't
have
called?
Or
send
one
of
those

Anything!
Fine!
Whatever!
Sorry.
-
Whoa!
ROSE:
Was
that
so
hard?

She
learned
a
new
word,
Rose.
Un-fucking-believable.
It's
gonna
be
great.
Oh!
There
he
is.

-
Okay,
let's
go.

Doesn't
he?

Come
on,
we
gotta
hurry.
Come
on!

Will
you
just
relax?!

Oh,
great.

Kenny.

Are
you
okay?
Look
what
happens
when
you
What
do
mean?
He's
fine.
-
What's
wrong
with
you?
-
David!
and
it's
in
four
fucking
hours.
If
you
think
I'm
gonna
lose
half
a
million

...then
you're
out
of
your
mind.
You're
making
half
a
million
dollars

Uh,
roughly.
Listen
to
me.
I
can
explain.
You
are
making
$500,000
You're
getting
30
grand?
Wait,
you
guys
are
getting
paid?
ROSE:
You're
a
liar.
-
We
want
to
renegotiate.

What?
David.
You
made
your
deal
with
me,
I
made
my

Good.
Casey
gets
it.
I
believe
we
are,
right
now,
because

You're
right
about
that.

be
in

it
wasn't

you

Slowing
you
down?

the

are
you
going?

I
said
where
are
you
going?
You
know
what?
You
leave,
I
don't
want
your
money,
okay?
Casey,
come
back.
-
Come
on!
Because
we're
a
family?
Huh?
You
want
to
spend
Christmas
together?
Please.
This
whole
thing
Oh,
no,
I'll
tell
you
what
the
joke
is!
"The
I"
I'm
not
gonna
tell
you
the
joke!
You
don't
deserve
to
hear
the
joke!
-
I
don't
think
you
knew
the
joke.
We
have
to
go
back
and
get
her.
What?
Are
you
kidding
me?
Are
you
coming
with
me
or
not,
Rose?
Fine.
I'll
slide
your
check
Kenny,
come
on!
Let's
go,
man.
We
can't
leave
her,
David.
It's
not
right.
-
You
know
what?
You
all
deserve
each
other.
Da...
Wha...?
He'll
come
back.
Right?
SCOTTIE:
Yo,
girl!

I
got
your
text.
What's
up?
Are
you
alone?
Yeah.
You
think
we
can
go
someplace
I
know
just
the
spot,

-
A
little
better.
I'm
just
playing
a
major
scale,

Let's
move
it.
Stop
talking.
Just
shut
the
fuck
up.

what's
up?
I'm
just
getting
some
singing
lessons

"Five"
is
the
name
of
the
band.
You're
fucking
with

love
it.

gotta
meet
this
guy.
Remember
that
song
"Brick"

It's...
I've
got...
It's
that
guy.
He's
like
my
personal
bitch.
-
Listen,
is
everything
okay?
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh,
things
are
fine.
I'm
about
200
miles
away.
-
All
right.
Peace.
Scales.
Let's
do
this.
This
gig
sucks.
Don't
talk
to

like
that.

nice
try,

Nice
try.
Heh.
Okay.
Ahem.
Let's
get
there.
Hoo.
Quiet.
And
I
knew
better
too.
But
we
were
all
on
the
road
together...
and
it
got
kind
of
fun,
you
know?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And
I
started
thinking
of
us
as
kind
of
Whatever,
it's
stupid.

Fuck
them.
Yo,
right
now,

Scottie
P.
Is
gonna
make

Ha-ha.
I'm
sorry,
I'm
just
feeling
kind
of
cry-ey
-
I'm
just
gonna
go,
okay?
-
You
texted
me.
You
know
what's
up.
ROSE:
Hey!
Get
your
hands
off
of
her!
Come
here,
Casey.
You
put
your
hands
on
her
again...
I
will
rip
that
fucking
tattoo

know
what
I'm
saying?

Oh,
really,

know
what?
Why
don't
you
leave
What
are
you
gonna
do,
eyebrows?
One...

SCOTTIE:
Ow!
Broke
my
nose!
You're
an
aggressive
woman.
Are
you
okay?
I'm
fine.
That
was
awesome.
I've
dealt
with
handsy
Let's
just
get
out
of
here.
Thanks
for
the
backup.
If
you're
gonna
punch
someone,
Well,
David
told
me
to
count.
David?
David
hasn't
punched
I
think
this
Way.
Exit.

I
have
returned.

Ha-ha-ha.
So
here's
what
happened,
okay?
I'm
out
on
the
open
road,
just
by
myself,
right?
And
I
start
to
realize
something:
So
I
thought,
You
gotta
turn
this
RV
around
Heh.
I'm
just
kidding,
What
do
you
say
we
go
home?
Hey,
David?
Go
fuck
yourself.
Uh...?
Ha!
"Go
fuck
yourself."
Rose,
you
say,
"Go
fuck
yourself."
Then
This
is
what
I
miss,
right?
Come
on,
guys.
Let's
get
out
of
here,
go
home.
Come
on,
let's
go!
-
Whoa,
hey,
hold
on.
Where
you
going?
Look,
look,
look.
Okay.
I
know
what
this
is
about,
and
I
get
it.
All
right?
Evenly.
Betwixt
the
four
of
us.
You
guys
get
what
I'm
saying
here?
Like
you're
from...
Right?
All
right,
Casey,
you
can
buy
a
house,
You
know
what
I
mean?
Like,
whatever.
You
get
$125,000.
You
get
a...
I
mean,
I'm
like
If
she
was
a
white

at
a

Heh.
Come
on,

Let's
get
in
the
RV...
and
take
our
butts
back
to
Denver
where
we're

-
Come
on,
come
on.
You
misled
us.
You
left
us.
And
then
you
come
waltzing
back
in
here
all...
and
you
just
expect
What's
wrong
with
you?
How
do
we
trust
you?

Okay,
look,
what
do
you
want?
Kids?
What
do
you
think?
-
That
would
make
me
feel
a
lot
better.
You're
joking.
Wha...?
You
really
want
me
to
get
on
my
knees?
It's
a
good
thing
I'm
wearing
I
usually
only
do
this
before
sex.
Okay,
okay,
I'm
going,
I'm
going.
Ahem.
Let's
do
it.
Here
we
go.
Okay!
To
the
RV,
let's
go.
Come
on,
Babs.

down.

get
in
here.

down
here.

I
never
get
used
to
that
language.

in

Uh...
Uh,
uh...
-
We
came
to
see
the

Us
too!
That's
so
weird!

Melissa,
can
we
talk?

Mom,
come
on,
let's

Why
are
you
being
so
rude?
Do
you
have
your
period?
Mom,
I
don't
need

Kenny.
Let's
go.
-
What
happened
last
night
was
wrong.

Oh,
my
God,
she
knows.
My
daughter
knows
what
we've
done.
Melissa,
yes,
it
was
wrong
of
me
You're
right.
I'm
not
gonna
deny
that
it

said,

and
I
are

Okay,
no,
stop!
I'm
not
as
tight
as
I
once
was.

Look...
It's
like
throwing
a
hot
dog
Ew!
What
are
you
talking
about?
I
saw
Kenny
making
out
with
his
sister
What?
Oh,
my...!
-
It
wasn't
quite
like
that.
Rose
isn't
my
mom,
she's
not

That's
enough,
son!
He's
been
drinking.
It's
hard

hired
us
to
help
him
smuggle

You're
drug
dealers?
No!
No,
we're
drug
smugglers.
There's
not
a
difference.
Okay,
Edie,
we
can
explain,
all
right?
ROSE:
This
is
a
small
misunderstanding.
When
he
says
"smuggle,"
he
doesn't

It's
not
drugs.
Seriously.
It's
just
a
little
tequila.

Oh,

wrong
place

friend.

I
would

tough
as
hell.
And
this

great
mom.
I
love
all
of
them.
Don't
