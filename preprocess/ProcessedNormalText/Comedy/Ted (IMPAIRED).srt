you're
miserable
then
I
promise
I
will

Please.
Rex,
I
don't
think
I'm
an
asshole,
It
worked
for
me
and
it's
been

cannot
take
responsibility
for

You
know
something?
I
didn't

I
wanted
you
to

because
You
can't
stand
there
that
you
haven't
always
seen
Lori
It
works
out
when
you
and

are
on
the
couch
at
9:00

And
then
when
we
saw
we
both
started
crying,
And
then
we
ran
up
to
it
and
we
tried
to
give
it
CPR,
John,
we
could
