MAN:
Get
up!
Get
up!




The
winner,
by
total
annihilation...
Yama!
Who
is
next?
Who
has
the
guts
to
step
into
CROWD:

Yama!
-
HIRO:
Can
I
try?
I
have
a
robot.
I
built
it
myself.


Beat
it,
kid.
House
rules.
You
gotta
pay
to
play.
Oh,
uh,
is
this
enough?
What's
your
name,
little
boy?
Hiro.
Hiro
Hamada.
Prepare
your
bot,
Zero.


Two
bots
enter,
one
bot
leaves.
Fighters
ready?
Fight!


That
was
my
first
fight.
No
one
likes
a
sore
loser,
little
boy.

Go
home.
HIRO:
I've
got
more
money.
REFEREE:
Fighters
ready?
Fight!

Mega-bot,
destroy.
Huh?
What?
Huh?

-
No
more
Little
Yama.
This
is
not
possible!
Hey,
I'm
as
surprised
as
you
are.
Beginner's
luck.
Do
you
want
to
go
again,
Yama?
-
No
one
hustles
Yama!
-
Teach
him
a
lesson.
Hey,
fellas.
Let's
talk
about
this.


-
Hiro!
Get
on!
Oh,
good
timing!

A-ha!
Oh,
mama!

-
Are
you
okay?
-
Are
you
hurt?
Then
what
were
you
thinking,
Ow!
Ow!
You
graduated
high
school
when
you
YAMA:
There
they
are!
Hey!

Hold
on!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
MAN:
Get
back
here.
Bot
fighting
is
illegal.
You're
going
to
get
yourself
arrested.
Bot
fighting
is
not
illegal.
Betting
on
bot
fighting,
But
so
lucrative!
I'm
on
a
roll,
big
brother!

BOTH:
Hi,
Aunt
Cass.
Are
you
guys
okay?
Tell
me
you're
okay.
-
We're
fine.

Oh,
good.
Then
what
were
you
For
10
years,
I
have
done
the
best
I
could
Have
I
been
perfect?
No.
Do
I
know
anything
about
children?
No.
Should
I
have
picked
up
a
book
Probably!
Where
was
I
going
with
this?
-
Sorry.
Well,
I
love
you,
too!

I
had
to
close
up
early
On
beat
poetry
night.
Stress
eating.
Because
of
you.
-
Come
on,
Mochi.
This
is
really
good!
You
better
make
this
up
to
Aunt
Cass
before
she
eats
everything
in
the
cafe.

For
sure.
And
I
hope
you
learned
Absolutely.
You're
going
bot
fighting,
aren't
you?
There's
a
fight
across
town.

When
are
you
gonna
start
doing
something
with
that
big
brain
of
yours?
What?
Go
to
college
like
you?
So
people
can
tell
me
stuff
Unbelievable.
Oh,
what
would
Mom
and
Dad
say?
I
don't
know.
They're
gone.
They
died
when
I
was
three,
remember?
Hey!
-
I'll
take
you.

I
can't
stop
you
from
going,
but
I'm
not
going
Sweet.
HIRO:
What
are
we
doing
Bot-fight's
that
way!
Gotta
grab
something.
Is
this
gonna
take
long?
Relax,
you
big
baby.
Anyway,
you've
never
seen
my
lab.
Oh,
great,
I
get
to
see
your
nerd
lab!

Whoa.

Who

Yeah.
I've

But,
not
fast

Oh!
Whoa,

Hey,
Wasabi.
This
is
my

Hiro.
Hello,
Hiro.
Prepare
to
be
amazed.
Catch.
Wow.

Laser-induced
plasma?
With
a
little
magnetic
confinement
for,
uh,
ultra-precision.
Wow.
How
do
you
find
anything
Oh!
I
have
a
system.
There's
a
place
for
everything,

Need
this!
This
is
anarchy!
Society
has
rules!
Excuse
me!
Coming
through!

Tadashi!
Oh,
my
gosh.
You
must
be
Hiro!

I've
heard
so
much
about
you!

Perfect
timing.
Perfect
timing.
That's
a
whole
lot
of
tungsten
carbide.
400
pounds
of
it!
Come
here,
come
here,
come
here.
You're
going
to
love
this.
A
dash
of
perchloric
acid,
a
hint
of
hydrogen
peroxide,
super-heated
to
500
Kelvin,
and...
Ta-da!
It's
pretty
great,
huh?
It's
so
pink.
Here's
the
best
part.

Whoa.
I
know,
right?

Chemical

Not
bad,

"Go

"Wasabi"?
I

One
time!
Fred
is
the
one
who
comes
up
Uh,
who's
Fred?
-
This
guy,
right
here!
Ah-ah.
Don't
be
alarmed.
This
is
not
my
real
face
and
body.
The
name's
Fred.
School
mascot
by
day,
but
by
night...

I
am
also
a
school
mascot.
So,
what's
your
major?
No,
no,
no,
I'm
not

But
I
am

I've
been

to

It's

not.
Yeah,

asked
Wasabi
for

it?
Well,
then,
what

TADASHI:

everybody
just
thinks
you're
crazy.
Just
stop.

FRED:
Hey,
what
about
So,
uh,
what
have
you
been
working
on?
I'll
show
you.
Duct
tape?

I
hate
to
break
it
to
you,
bro.
Already

invented.
Hey!

Oh!
Dude!
-
Ow!
This
is
what
I've
been
working
on.

Hello.
I
am
Baymax.
Your
personal
healthcare
companion.
I
was
alerted
to
the
need
for
medical
attention
A
robotic
nurse.
On

I
will
scan
you
now.

Scan

You
have
a
slight

I
suggest
an
anti-bacterial
spray.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
What's
in
the
spray,
specifically?
The
primary
ingredient
is
bacitracin.

That's
a
bummer.
I'm
actually
allergic
to
that.
You
are
not
allergic
to
bacitracin.
You
do
have
a
mild
allergy
to
peanuts.
Hmm.
Not
bad.
You've
done
some
serious

No

I
cannot
be
offended.

Hyperspectral

Huh.
Hmm.

Titanium
skeleton?
Right.
Even
lighter.

Killer
actuators.
Oh,
machined
them
right
here,
in-house.
-
Really?
He
can

1,000
pounds.
Shut
up.
You
have
been
a
good
boy.
Nice.
I
cannot

until
you
say
Well
then,
I'm
satisfied
with
my
care.
He's
going
to
help
a
lot
of
people.
Hey,
what
kind
of
battery
does
it
use?
Lithium
ion.
You
know,
supercapacitors
Huh.
Burning
the
midnight
oil,
Mr.
Hamada?
TADASHI:
Oh,
hey,
Professor.
Actually,
I
was
just
finishing
up.
CALLAGHAN:
You
must
be
Hiro.
Bot-fighter,
right?
When
my
daughter
was
younger,
May
I?
Uh,
sure.
Hmm.
Magnetic-bearing
servos.
Pretty
sick,
huh?
Wanna
see
how
I
put
'em
together?
Hey,
genius!
He
invented
them.
You're
Robert
Callaghan?

Like,
as
in,
the
Callaghan-Catmull
spline,
and
Callaghan's
"Laws
of
Robotics?"
That's
right.
Ever
think
about
applying
here?
Your
age
wouldn't
be
an
issue.
Oh,
I
don't
know.
He's
pretty
serious
about
Well,
kind
of
serious.
I
can
see
why.
With
your
bot,
winning
must
come
easy.
Yeah,
I
guess.
Well,
if
you
like
things
easy,
We
push
the
boundaries
of
robotics
here.
My
students
go
on
to
shape
the
future.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Hiro.
Good
luck
with
the
bot-fights.

We
gotta
hurry
if
you
I
have
to
go
here.

If
I
don't
go
I'm
gonna
lose
my
mind.
How
do
I
get
in?
Every
year,
the
school
has
You
come
up
with
something
But,
it's
gotta
be
great.
Trust
me.
It
will
be.



HIRO:
Nothing!
No
ideas!
Useless,
empty
brain!
Wow.
Washed
up
at
14.
So
sad.
I
got
nothing!
I'm
done.
Hey,
I'm
not
giving
up
on
you.


What
are
you
doing?
Shake
things
up.
Use
that
big
brain
of
yours
-
What?

Huh.



Wow,
a
lot
of
sweet
tech
here
today.
How
are
you
feeling?
You're
talking
to
an
ex-bot
fighter.
-
Yep,
he's
nervous.
Oh,
you
have
nothing
-
He's
so
tense.
Relax,
Hiro.
Your
tech
is
amazing.
Tell
him,
Go
Go.
-
Stop
whining.
Woman
up.
What
do
you
need,
little
man?
Fresh
pair
of
underpants?
Underpants?
You
need
serious
help.
Hey,
I
come
prepared.
I
haven't
done
laundry
in
six
months.
One
pair
lasts
me
four
days.
I
go
front,
I
go
back,
I
go
inside-out.

Then
I
go
front
and
back.
Wow.
That
is

Don't
encourage

It's
called
"recycling."
ANNOUNCER:
Next
presenter,
Hiro
Hamada.

Oh,
yeah.
This
is
it.
I
guess
I'm
up.
Okay,
photo,
photo!
-
ALL:
Hiro!
We
love
you,
Hiro.
Good
luck!
-
Don't
mess
it
up.
Science,
yeah!
All
right,
bro.
This
is
it.
Come
on.
Don't
leave
me
hanging.
What's
going
on?
I
really
want
to
go
here.
Hey.
You
got
this.

Uh...
Hi.
-
My
name
is
Hiro...


Sorry.
My
name
is
Hiro
Hamada,
and
I've
been
working
on
something
that
I
think
is
pretty
cool.
I
hope
you
like
it.

This
is
a
microbot.


Breathe.

It
doesn't
look
like
much,
but
when
it
links
up

MAN:
Oh.
Whoa!
Things
get
a
little
more
interesting.

The
microbots
are
controlled
CROWD:
Whoa!
I
think
what
I
want
them
to
do...

They
do
it.

The
applications
for
this
tech
Construction.
What
used
to
take
teams
for
months
or
years,
can
now
be
accomplished
by
one
person.

And
that's
just
the
beginning.
How
about
transportation?
Microbots
can
move
anything
anywhere,
with
ease.

If
you
can
think
it,
The
only
limit
is
your
imagination.
-
Microbots!
CASS:
That's
my
nephew!
-
Yes!
My
family!
I
love
my
family!
-
TADASHI:
Nailed
it!

-
HONEY
LEMON:
You
did
it!
FRED:
Yeah!
You
just
blew
my
mind,
dude!
They
loved
you.
That
was
amazing!
KREI:
Yes.
With
some
development,
your
tech
could
be
revolutionary.

Alistair
Krei!
May
I?
Hmm.
Extraordinary.
I
want
your
microbots
at
Krei
Tech.
Shut
up.
CALLAGHAN:
Mr.
Krei
is
right.
Your
microbots
are
You
can
continue
to
develop
them,
or
you
can
sell
them
to
a
man
who's
only
guided
Robert,
I
know
how
you
feel
about
me,
but
it
shouldn't
affect...
CALLAGHAN:
This
is
your
decision,
Hiro.
But
you
should
know
Mr.
Krei
has
cut
corners
-
to
get
where
he
is.
KREI:
That's
just
not
true.
I
wouldn't
trust
Krei
Tech
-
or
anything
else.
Hiro,
I'm
offering
you
more
money
than
any
14-year-old
could
imagine.
I
appreciate
the
offer,
Mr.
Krei,
but
they're
not
for
sale.
I
thought
you
were
smarter
than
that.
Robert.
Mr.
Krei.
That's
my
brother's.
Oh.
That's
right.
I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
in
class.


-
Unbelievable!
WASABI:
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
CASS:
All
right,
geniuses,
Back
to
the
café!
-
Dinner
is
on
me!
Yes!
Nothing
is
better
than
free
food!
-
Aunt
Cass?
We'll,
uh...
We'll
catch
up,
okay?
Sure.
I'm
so
proud
of
you.

Both
of
you.
-
BOTH:
Thanks,
Aunt
Cass.
HIRO:
I
know
what
you're
going
to
say.

"I
should
be
"because
I'm
finally
using
my
gift
"for
something
important."
No,
no.
I
was
just
gonna
tell
you
Ha-ha-hilarious.
-
What?
Ah.


Welcome
to
nerd
school,
nerd.

Hey,
I,
um...
I
wouldn't
be
here
you
know,
thanks
for
not
giving
up
on
me.
-


Are
you
okay?

Yeah.
I'm
okay.
But
Professor
Callaghan
Tadashi,
no!
Callaghan's
in
there.
Someone
has
to
help.

HIRO:
Tadashi!
Tadashi!


Here.
Have
some
tea.

CASS:
Hey,
sweetie.
Hey,
Aunt
Cass.
Mrs.
Matsuda's
in
the
café.
She's
wearing
something
super
That
always
cracks
you
up.
You
should
come
down.
-
Maybe
later.
The
university
called
again.
It's,
uh,
been
a
few
weeks
But
they
said
Okay.
Thanks.
I'll
think
about
it.

ALL:
Hey,
Hiro.
We
just
wanted
to
check
in,
We
wish
you
were
here,
buddy.
Hiro,
if
I
could
have
only
it
would
be
the
ability
and
give
you
a
big
hug.
Ow!

Ow!
Hello.
I
am
Baymax,
your
personal
healthcare
companion.
Uh,
hey,
Baymax.
I
didn't
know
you
were
still
active.
I
heard
a
sound
of
distress.
What
seems
to
be
the
trouble?
Oh,
I
just
stubbed
my
toe
a
little.
I'm
fine.
On
a
scale
of
1
to
10,
A
zero.
I'm
okay,
really.
Thanks.
You
can
shrink
now.
Does
it
hurt
when
I
touch
it?
That's
okay.
No
touching.
I'm
fine...
Ah!

Ow.
You
have
fallen.
You
think?

Ow!
-
On
a
scale
of
1
to...
-
On
a
scale...
-
On
a
sca...
-
On
a
scale
of
1
to
10...
On
a
scale
of
1
to
10,
Zero.
-
It
is
all
right
to
cry.
Crying
is
a
natural
response
to
pain.
I'm
not
crying.
-
I
will
scan
you
for
injuries.
-
Scan
complete.
You
have
sustained
no
injuries.
However,
your
hormone
indicate
that
you
are
common
in
adolescence.
Diagnosis,
puberty.
Whoa,
what?
Okay.

You
should
expect
an
increase
especially
on
your
face,
Thank
you!
That's
enough.
You
may
also
experience
Okay!
Let's
get
you
I
cannot
deactivate
until
you
say
you
are
satisfied
with
your
care.
Fine.
I'm
satisfied
with
my...
Whoa!


Huh?

My
microbot?
This
doesn't
make
any
sense.
Puberty
can
often
be
a
confusing
time
for
a
young
adolescent
No.
The
thing
is
attracted
but
that's
impossible.
They
were
destroyed
in
the
fire.
Dumb
thing's
broken.

Your
tiny
robot
Oh,
yeah?
Why
don't
you,
uh,
find
out
Would
that
stabilize
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.

-

Uh...
Baymax?
Baymax?
Baymax?
-



What?


-
Hiro?
Wow.
You're
up
and...
Yeah!
I
figured
it
was
time.
Are
you
registering
for
school?
Uh,
yes.
I
thought
about
what
you
said.
-
Oh,
honey,
that's
so
great.
Okay,
special
dinner
tonight.
I'll
whip
up
some
chicken
wings.
You
know,
with
the
hot
sauce

-
Okay,
sounds
good.
Last
hug.




Baymax!



Ah!
-
Baymax!

MAN
2:
Watch
it!


Baymax!

Whoa!


Baymax!
Are
you
crazy?
What
are
you
doing?
I
have
found
where
I
told
you,
it's
broken.
Huh?
Locked.
There
is
a
window.
-

A
fall
from
this
height

-

Oh,
no.
Shh!
Excuse
me
while
I
let
out
some
air.

Are
you
done?

Yes.
It
will
take
me
a
moment
to
re-inflate.
Fine,
just
keep
it
down.


My
microbots?
Someone's
making
more.
-
BAYMAX:
Hiro?
You
gave
me
a
heart
attack!
My
hands
are
equipped
Stop,
stop,
stop!
Oh,
no.
Run!
Oh,
come
on!
I
am
not
fast.
Yeah,
no
kidding!
Go!
Go!
Come
on.

Kick
it
down!
-
Then
punch
it!
Go!
Go!

Oh,
come
on!
Go,
go,
go!


Move
it!
Ah!
Come
on!

Whoa.
No,
no.



Come
on!
The
window!


Suck
it
in!
Whoa!
Baymax!
Hiro?


Come
on,
let's
get
out
of
here.
Go!
Hurry!
All
right,
let
me
get
this
straight.
A
man
in
a
kabuki
mask
attacked
you,
with
an
army
of
miniature
flying
robots.
"Microbots."
-
Microbots.
He
was
controlling
them
telepathically
with
a
neurocranial
transmitter.
So,
Mr.
Kabuki
was
using
ESP
to
attack
you
and
balloon
man.




Did
you
file
a
report
when
your
flying
robots
were
stolen?
No.
I
thought
they
were
all
destroyed.
Look,
I
know
it
sounds
crazy,
-
Tell
him.
He's
telling
the
truth.

What
the...

Low
battery.


Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.

Try
to
keep
it
together.

I'm
healthcare,
your
personal
Baymax
companion.
Kid,
how
about
we
call
your
parents
-
and
get
them
down
here?
Write
your
name
and
number
down
on
this
piece
of
paper,
and
we
can...
Oh!
I've
gotta
get
you
home
Can
you
walk?
I
will
scan
you
now.
Scan
complete.

Healthcare.
Okay.
If
my
aunt
asks,
we
were
at
school
all
day.
Got
it?
We
jumped
out
a
window.
No!
Quiet!
Shh.

We
jumped
out
a
window.
You
can't
say
things
like
that
Shh...
Huh?
Shh.
-
CASS:
Hiro?
-
You
home,
sweetie?
That's
right.
I
thought
I
heard
you.
Hi.
Hey,
Aunt
Cass.
Oh,
look
at
my
little
college
man.
Ah,
I
can't
wait
to
hear
all
about
it!
Oh,
and
wings
are
almost
ready.
Whee!
Will
you
be
quiet?
Yeah,
wings!
Whee!

All
right,
get
ready
to
have
We
are
gonna
feel
these
things
tomorrow.
You
know
what
I'm
saying?
Okay.
Sit
down.
Tell
me
everything.

Um...
The
thing
is
that,
I've
got
a
lot
of
school
stuff

What
was
that?
Mochi.
Ooh,
that
darn
cat.


At
least
take
a
plate

-
Don't
work
too...
-
Hairy
baby.
Hairy
baby.

All
right,
come
on.
I'm
healthcare,
One
foot
in
front
of
the
other.




This
doesn't
make
any
sense.

BAYMAX:
Tadashi.
What?
Tadashi.
Tadashi's
gone.
When
will
he
return?
He's
dead,
Baymax.
BAYMAX:
Tadashi
was
in
excellent
health.
With
a
proper
diet
and
exercise,
he
should
have
lived
a
long
life.
Yeah,
he
should
have.
But
there
was
a
fire
and...

Now,
he's
gone.
-
Tadashi
is
here.
People
keep
saying
he's
not
really
gone.
As
long
as
we
remember
him.

It
still
hurts.
I
see
no
evidence
of
physical
injury.
It's
a
different
kind
of
hurt.
You
are
my
patient.
I
would
like
to
help.
You
can't
fix
this
one,
buddy.

Uh,
what
are
you
doing?
I
am
downloading
Database
downloaded.
Treatments
include
contact
I
am
contacting
them
now.
No,
no,
no!

I...
Your
friends
have
been
contacted.
Unbelievable.
Now,
what
are
you
doing?
Other
treatments
include
I'm
okay.
Really.
You
will
be
all
right.
There,
there.

Thanks,
Baymax.
I
am
sorry
about
the
fire.
It's
okay.
It
was
an
accident.
Unless...
Unless
it
wasn't.

At
the
showcase,
that
guy
in
the
mask
And
then
set
the
fire
He's
responsible
for
Tadashi.
We
gotta
catch
that
guy.
MAN:

It's
alive!
It's
alive,
it's
alive!
It's
alive!

HIRO:
If
we're
gonna
catch
that
guy,
Will
apprehending
the
man
in
the
mask
improve
your
emotional
state?
Absolutely.
Let's
work
on
your
moves.
Now,
let's
take
care
of
this.
BAYMAX:
I
have
some
concerns.
This
armor
may
undermine
my
non-threatening,
huggable
design.
That's
kind
of
the
idea,
buddy.
You
look
sick.
I
cannot
be
sick.
I
am
a
robot.
It's
just
an
expression.
AUTOMATED

I

You

don't
you?
Punch
this.

Yes!
Hammerfist!
Side

Knifehand!
Back

Gummy
bears!
Yes!

Yeah!
Fist
bump!
"Fist
bump"
is
not
in
No,
this
isn't
a
fighting
thing.
It's
what
people
do
sometimes
when
they're
excited
or
pumped
up.

Ba-da-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia.
Hey,
now
you're
getting
it.
I
will
add
"fist

All
right.
Let's
go
get
that
guy.

Come
on!

Get
him,
Baymax!


We're
too
late.
BAYMAX:
Your
tiny

Come
on.

Always
wait
one
hour
after
eating
before
swimming.
Hey!
Come
on!
Your
heart
rate
has
Shh!
Okay,
Baymax,

-
ALL:
Hiro?
Get
out
of
here!
Go!
Dude,
what
are
you
doing
out
here?

Nothing!
Helps
my
pubescent
mood
swings.
Is
that
Baymax?
-
Yeah,
but
you
really...
Why
is
he
wearing
I
also
know
karate.
You
guys
need
to
go.
No,
don't
push
us
away,
Hiro.
That's
why
Baymax
contacted
us.
Those
who
suffer
a
loss,
require
support
Okay,
but
I...
Who
would
like
Ooh.
I'll
go.
Okay.

My
name
is
Fred,
and
it
has
Holy
mother
of
Megazon!
WASABI:
Ah...
Am
I
the
only
one
seeing
this?

Oh,
my
gosh!
Oh,
no!
-
Go!
-

No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
saving
your
life.
-


BAYMAX:
Oh,
no.
Wasabi!
Ah,
goodbye!
Hiro.
Explanation.
Now.
He
stole
my
microbots.

I
don't
know
who
he
is!
Baymax,
palm-heel
strike!

-
Hard
left!
Huh.
That
mask,
the
black
suit...
We're
under
attack
I
mean,
how
cool
is
that?
I
mean,
it's
scary,
obviously.

-

The
light's
red!
There
are
no
red
lights
in
a
car
chase!

Why
is
he
trying
to
kill
us?
Um,
why
are
you
trying
to
kill
us?
It's
classic
villain.
Let's
not
jump
to
conclusions.
We
don't
know
he's
trying
to
kill
us.
Car!
HONEY
LEMON:
He's
trying
to
kill
us!
Did
you
just
put
your
blinker
on?
You
have
to
indicate
your
turn!
It's
the
law!
That's
it.

Uh!

WASABI:
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.



Whoa!
Stop
the
car!
Baymax
and
I
can
take
this
guy!

BAYMAX:
Seatbelts
save
lives.
Buckle
up,
every
time.

Ah...
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
WASABI:
What
are
you
doing?
What
are
you
doing?
What
are
you
doing?


-
Did
we
lose
him?
Baymax,
hold
on!
-
WASABI:
We're
not
gonna
make
it!
WASABI:
We're
not
gonna
make
it!
-
We're
not
gonna
make
it!

We
made
it!
Yes!





I
told
you
we'd
make
it!
Your
injuries
require
my
attention.
And
your
body
temperatures
are
low.
We
should
get
out
of
here.
I
know
a
place.

-
Ooh.
Where
are
we?
HIRO:
Fred.

Where
are
you
going?
Oh.
Welcome
to
mi
casa.
That's
French
for
"front
door."
It's
really
not.
Listen,
nitwit.
A
lunatic
in
a
mask
I'm
not
in
the
mood
for
any...
Welcome
home,
Master
Frederick.
Heathcliff,
my
man!
Come
on
in,
guys.
We'll
be
safe
in
here.
Gimme
some.
Ba-da-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia.
Freddie,
this
is
your
house?
I
thought
you
lived
under
a
bridge.
Well,
technically,
They're
on
a
vacay
on
the
family
island.
You
know,
we
should
GO
GO:
You
gotta
be
kidding
me.

If
I
wasn't
just
attacked
I
think
this
would
be
GO
GO:
Mmm.
WASABI:
My
brain
hates
my
eyes
Your
body
temperature
is
still
low.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Ahh!
It's
like
spooning
a
warm
marshmallow.
Hmm,
it's
so
nice.
Oh,
yeah,
ah,
that's
toasty.

Good
robot.
Does
this
symbol
-
Yes!
It's
a
bird!
The
guy
in
the
mask
with
this
symbol
on
it.
Apprehending
the
man
in
the
mask
Apprehend
him?
We
don't
even
know
who
he
is.
I
have
a
theory.
WASABI:
"Dr.
Slaughter,
MD"?
Actually,
millionaire
weapons
designer,
Malcolm
Chazzletick.
"The
Annihilator"?
Behind
the
mask,
"Baron
von
Destruct"?
Don't
you
guys
get
it?
The
man
in
the
mask
who
attacked
us
is
none
other
than...
Voila!
Alistair
Krei.
-
What?
Krei
wanted
your
microbots,
and
you
said
no.
But
rules
don't
apply
HIRO:
There's
no
way.
Then
who
was
that
guy
in
the
mask?

I
don't
know.
We
don't
know
anything
about
him.
BAYMAX:
His
blood
type
is
AB-negative.
Cholesterol
levels
are...
Baymax,
you
scanned
him?
I
am
programed
to
assess
Yes!

I
can
use
the
data
Uh,
you'd
have
to
scan
That
might
take,
I
don't
know,
forever.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I...
I
just
have
to
look
for
another
angle.
Got
it!
I'll
scan
the
whole
city
I
just
have
to
upgrade
Baymax's
sensor.
Actually,
if
we're
gonna
catch
this
guy,
I
need
to
upgrade
all
of
you.
Upgrade
who,
now?
Those
who
suffer
a
loss
require
support
from
friends
and
loved
ones.

Oh,
okay,
We
can't
go
against
that
guy!
Hiro,
we
want
to
help,
but
we're
just
us.
No.
You
can
be
way
more.
Tadashi
Hamada
was
our
best
friend.
-
We're
in.
Can
you
feel
it?
Our
origin
story
begins.
We're
gonna
be
superheroes!
HIRO:
Arms
up.
The
neurotransmitter
We
get
the
mask,
Game
over.
They
say
But
we
don't
have
to
be
I'm
bad
behavior
But
I
do
it
in
the
best
way
I'll
be
the
watcher
Of
the
eternal
flame
I'll
be
the
guard
dog
Of
all
your
fever
dreams
I
am
the
sand
in
the
bottom
'Cause
we
could
be
immortals

Immortals
Just
not
for
long
-
For
long
Live
with
me
forever
now
Pull
the
blackout
curtains
down
Just
not
for

We
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Sometimes
the
only
payoff
For
having
any
faith
Is
when
it's
tested
again
And
again

I'm
still
comparing
your
past
-

'Cause
we
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Just
not
for

FRED:
Super
Jump!
Super
Jump!
And
live
with
me
forever
now
Pull
the

-
Whoo-hoo!
I
breathe
fire.
For
long
We
could
be
immortals

Immortals
Immortals

Immortals
-
Ah!
Immortals
Immortals

Whoo-hoo!
Not
bad.
Anybody
else's
suit
riding
up
on
them?
HIRO:
Hey,
guys!
Check
this
out.
I'd
like
to
introduce,
Baymax
2.0.
FRED:

He's
glorious.
Hello.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa...
Hold
up.
Focus.
Show
'em
what
you
got,
buddy.
The
fist,
show
them
the
fist.
Ba-da-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia.

No,
not
that.
The
thing,
the
other
thing.
ALL:
Whoa!
Rocket
fist
make
Freddie
so
happy!
That's
just
one
of
his
new
upgrades!
Baymax,
wings.
FRED:
No
way!
Thrusters.
I
fail
to
see
how
flying
makes
me
a
better
healthcare
companion.
I
fail
to
see
how
you
fail
to
see
that
it's
awesome!
Full
thrust.


-
BOY:
Whoa!
Look,
let's
just
take
this
slow.

Up,
up,
up,
up,
up!
Thrust,
thrust,
thrust!

Too
much
thrust!
Too
much
thrust!
Too
much

No,

Back

Back

On!
On!
On!
Zoom...
Oh!
Go
up!
Up,
up,
up!

Up!
Oh,
man!
Maybe...
Maybe
enough
flying
for
today.


What
do
you
say?
Your
neurotransmitter
levels
Which
means
what?
The
treatment
is
working.
Oh,
no!
No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Whoa,
Baymax!


Yes!
Whoo!

Whoo!

Yeah!
Oh!
Whoa!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo!
HIRO:
Wow!
That
was...
That
was...
Sick.
-
It
is
just
an
expression.
That's...
That's
right,
buddy.
I
am
never
taking
the
bus
again.
Your
emotional
state
has
improved.
I
can
deactivate
if
you
say
you
are
satisfied
with
your
care.
What?
No,
I
don't
want
you
to
deactivate.
We
still
have
to
find
that
guy.
So,
fire
up
that
super-sensor.
BAYMAX:
Functionality
improved.
1000%
increase
in
range.
-

on
that
island.
-
Killer
view.
If
I
wasn't
terrified
of
heights,
I'd
probably
love
this.
But
I'm
terrified
of
heights,
There.
Baymax,
take
us
in.
Awesome!
Our
first
landing
together
as
a
team.

Guys,
come
on.
"Quarantine"?
Uh,
do
you
people
know
BAYMAX:
"Quarantine."
Enforced
isolation
to
prevent
contamination
or,
in
some
cases,
death.
Oh!
There's
a
skull
face
on
this
one.
A
skull
face!

Be
ready.
He
could
be
anywhere.
-

-

-
Spitting
fire!
Spitting
fire!


FRED:
That
was
a

Well,
at
least

FRED:

Six

Fred's

It's

Fred,
I
will
laser-hand
you
in
the

Guys.
Shh.
Any

of
him,
Baymax?
BAYMAX:
This

Perfect.
The

Uh,

you

want
to

it
is,

I'm
not
sure.
But
look.
HONEY
LEMON:
Hiro.
Krei.

KREI:
That's
right.
We
were
asked
to
do
the
impossible.
That's
what
we
did.
We've
reinvented
the
very
concept
of
transportation.
Friends,
I
present
General,
may
I?
FRED:
Whoa!
Magic
hat!

Teleportation.
The
transport
of
matter
Not
science
fiction
anymore.
Now,
we
didn't
spend
billions
to
teleport
hats.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Ready
to
go
for
a

We've
invited
all

BAYMAX:
Oh,
no.

Baymax,
get
us
out

Go

Behind

It's

Super

Hey!



WASABI:
Hey!
Uh,
you
want
to
dance,
masked
man?
Huh?
'Cause
you'll
be
dancing
with
these.
Hand
over
the

And
a
little

of
that!


Whoo!
Hey!
I
did
all
right.

Is
that
all
you
got?
Oh.
You
got
that,
too?

It's
back
into

It's
over,
Krei.


Pro...
Professor
Callaghan?

The
explosion...
You
died.
No.
I
had
your

But,
Tadashi.
You
just
let
him
die.
Give
me
the

Hiro.
He
went
in
there
to
save
you!
That
was
his
mistake!

Baymax,
destroy.
My

me
Not

Hiro,
this

not

Do
it,
Baymax!
Destroy
him!


No!
Stop,

No,
stop!
He's
getting
away!

GO
GO:
Baymax!



My

BAYMAX:
I
regret
any

How
could
you
do
that?
I
had
him!
What
you
just
did,
We
said
we'd
catch
the
guy.
That's
it.
I
never
should
have
let
you
help

Baymax,

Hiro,
this

part
of
the
plan.
Fly!
ALL:
Hiro!

BAYMAX:
Your
blood
pressure
is
elevated.
You
appear
to
be
distressed.
I'm
fine!
There.
Is
it
working?
-
My
sensor
is
operational.
Then
let's
get...
What?
Are
you
going
to
remove
Yes.
Open!
My
purpose
is
to
heal

Baymax,
open
your
access
port.
Do
you
want
me
to
terminate
Just
open!
Will
terminating
Professor
Callaghan
improve
your
emotional
state?
Yes!
No!
I
don't
know!
Open
your
access!
-
Is
this
what
Tadashi
wanted?
Tadashi
programed
me
to
aid
and...
Tadashi's
gone!
Tadashi's
gone.
Tadashi
is
here.
No.
He's
not
here.
Tadashi
is
here.
TADASHI:
This
is
Tadashi
Hamada.
And
this
is
the
first
test
-
BAYMAX:
Hello,
I
am
Baymax.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!

The
seventh
test
of
my
robotics
project.
BAYMAX:
Hello,
I...
What?
Ooh,
what?
Wait,
wait,
wait,
stop!
Tadashi
Hamada
again,
and
this
is
the
33rd
test


I'm
not
giving
up
on
you.
You
don't
understand
this
yet,
-
So,
let's
get
back
to
work.
This
is,
uh,
Tadashi
Hamada,
and
this
is
the
84th
test.

What
do
you
say,
big
guy?
Hello,
I
am
Baymax,
your
personal
healthcare
companion.
It
works.
It
works!
Oh,
this
is
amazing!
You...
You
work!
I
knew
it!
I
knew
it!
I
knew
it.
I
knew
it.
Oh,
you
work.
Okay.
All
right,
big
moment,
here.
-
Scan
me.
BAYMAX:
Your
neurotransmitter
This
indicates
that
you
are
happy.
I
am.
I
really
am.
Oh,
man.
Wait
till
my
brother
sees
you.
You're
gonna
help
so
many
people,
buddy.
So
many.
That's
all
for
now.

Thank
you,
Baymax.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
guess
I'm
not
like
my
brother.
GO
GO:
Hiro.

Guys,
I...
Uh,
I...
We're
going
to
catch
Callaghan,
and,
this
time,
we'll
do
it
right.
Eh,
but
maybe
don't
leave
your
team
-
Oh,
man.
Heathcliff
picked
us
up
Hiro,
we
found
something
you
should
see.
You
almost
got
us
all
killed!
Krei!
You
did
this!
You
knew
it
wasn't
ready!
HIRO:
Callaghan?
He
was
there?
He
was
such
a
good
man.
What
happened?
I
don't
know.
But
the
answer's
here
somewhere.
Wait,
wait!
Stop.
There
he
is.
HIRO:
With
the
pilot.
-
Hang
on.
We've
invited
all
these
people...

HIRO:
The
pilot
was
Callaghan
blames
Krei.
This
is
a
revenge
story.
So,
what
are
we
waiting
for?

MAN:
It's
all
set
up.
KREI
OVER
PA:
This
beautiful
new
campus
is
the
culmination
of
a
lifelong
dream.
But
none
of
this
would've
been
possible
without
a
few
bumps
in
the
road.
Those
setbacks
made
us
stronger,
-
to
a
bright
future.
MAN:
What
is
that?
-
What?


Ah!


Was
my
daughter
a
"setback"?
Callaghan!
But
you...
Your
daughter,
that...
That
was
an
accident.
-
No!
You
knew
it
was
unsafe.
My
daughter
is
gone

What
are
you
doing?
You
took
everything
from
me
when
you
sent
Abigail
into
that
machine.
Now
I'm
taking
everything
from
you.
KREI:
No!
No!
No!
You
can't!
You're
going
to
watch
Then,
it's
your
turn.
-
HIRO:
Professor
Callaghan!
Let
him
go!
Is
this
what
Abigail
would've
wanted?
Abigail
is
gone!
This
won't
change
anything.
Listen
to
the
kid,
Callaghan.
Please,
let
me
go.
I'll
give
you
anything
you
want!
I
want
my
daughter
back!

HIRO:
Go
for
the
mask!




ALL:
Baymax!
-








FRED:
Oh,
no!


Ha!

Getting
a
little
tight.
Ah!
Oh!


-
HONEY
LEMON:
No!
-
GO
GO:
There's
no
way
out!
WASABI:
Help!
I
can't
beat
him.

Hiro!
-
GO
GO:
Hiro?
Hiro?
-
That's
it!
-
I
know
how
to
beat
him.
Listen
up!
Use
those
big
brains
of
yours
and
think
your
way
around
the
problem.
Look
for
a
new
angle.




My
arms!
They
can't
go
any
further!

Wait
a
second,
it's
a
suit.
Hello,
sign.
Care
to
go
for
a
little
spin?
Hi-ya!
Double
spin!
Behind-the-back
spin!
Yeah!
Yeah!



HIRO:
Baymax!


-


I
love
that
robot!
Ow!
Okay,
new
plan.
Forget
the
mask.
Take
out
the
bots.
They'll
get
sucked
up
into
the
portal.
Now
that
is
a
plan!
Honey,
Fred,
can
you
give
us
some
cover?
FRED:
Like
you
have
to
ask.
Let's
do
this,
Freddie!
FRED:
Smokescreen!
HIRO:
Ready
and
dive!
Whoa,
the
gravity's
getting
Wait.
Let's
use
this!


These
are
green
blades
of
fury!

GO
GO:
Woman
up!
FRED:
Double
sign-spin.
Now
my
signs
are
on
fire!
HONEY
LEMON:
Whoo!

Whoo!
Now
that's
a
chemical
reaction!
BAYMAX:
Back
kick.
Hammerfist.
This
ends
now!

Looks
like
you're
out
of
microbots.
What?

Baymax!
No!

Huh?

Our
programing
prevents
us
-
But
we'll
take
that.
Whoa!



It's
still
on!
We
have
to
shut
it
down!
We
can't!
The
portal
is
gonna
tear
itself
apart!
We
need
to
get
out
of
here,
now!
Baymax!
My
sensor
is
detecting
signs
of
life.
-
What?
The
life
signs
are
female.
She
appears
to
be
in
hyper-sleep.
Callaghan's
daughter.
She's
still
alive.
Abigail.
Let's
go
get
her.
The
portal
is
destabilizing.
She's
alive
in
there.
Someone
has
to
help.
What
do
you
say,
buddy?
Flying
makes
me
HIRO:
Careful!
There's
Krei



Look
out!



Ah!

I
have
located
the
patient.
Hurry!
Come
on,
buddy,
let's
get
her
home.
I'll
guide
you
out
of
here.
Let's
go!
Veer
right!
Okay,
to
the
left.
Hard
right!
Up
and
over.
Okay,
level
off.
Easy.
Whoo-hoo!
Nice
flying!
Almost
there!
Baymax!
Baymax!

My
thrusters
are
inoperable.
Just
grab
hold.


There
is
still
a
way
I
cannot
deactivate
until
you
say
No,
no,
no,
no.
Wait.
What
about
you?
-
You
are
my
patient.
Your
health
is
my
only
concern.
Stop!
I'm
gonna
figure
out...
Are
you
satisfied
with
your
care?
No.
There's
gotta
be
another
way.
I'm
not
gonna
leave
you
here.
There
is
no
time.
Are
you
satisfied
with
your
care?
Please!
No...
I
can't
lose
you,
too.
Hiro,
I
will
always
be
with
you.

I'm
satisfied
with
my
care.
WASABI:
Hiro!
FRED:
Yeah!
They
made
it!
Baymax?
Miss,
can
you
hear
me?
Abigail
Callaghan.
Okay,
Abigail,
you
are
gonna
be
fine.
We're
taking
you
to
the
hospital.
OFFICER:
Move
it!

OFFICER:
Get
in
there.
NEWS
REPORTER:
at
the
headquarters
Reports
are
still
flooding
in
about
who
prevented
what
could
have
been
a
major
catastrophe.
The
whole
city
"Who
are
these
heroes?
"And
where
are
they
now?"
-
Hey.
It's
so
exciting.
CASS:
Hey,
sweetie!
Okay.
Mmm...

Last
hug.
Bye!
-
And
just
then
I
was
like...
Bah-Ia-Ia-Ia-Ia.
HIRO:
Ow?
BAYMAX:
I
am
Baymax,
your
personal
healthcare
companion.
-
Hello,
Hiro.
HIRO:
Whoo-hoo!
We
didn't
set
out
to
be
superheroes,
but
sometimes
life
doesn't
go
The
good
thing
is,
my
brother
and
that's
what
we're
gonna
do.
Who
are
we?

They
say,
"We
are
what
we
are"
But
we
don't
have
to
be
I'm
bad
behavior
But
I
do
it
in
the
best
way
I'll
be
the
watcher
Of
the
eternal
flame
I'll
be
the
guard
dog
Of
all
your
fever
dreams
I
am
the
sand
in
the
bottom
Glass
I
try
to
picture
me
'Cause
we
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Just
not
for
long
Live
with
me
forever
now
Pull
the
blackout
curtains
down
Just
not
for
long
For
long
We
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Sometimes
the
only
payoff
For
having
any
faith
Is
when
it's
tested
again
And
again
I'm
still
comparing
your
past
To
my
future
It
might
be
open
but
they're
not
sutured
I
am
the
sand
in
the
bottom
I
try
to
picture
me
without
'Cause
we
could
be
Immortals
Just
not
for
long
Live
with
me
forever
now
We
pull
the
blackout
curtains
down
Just
not
for
long
We
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Immortals
And
live
with
me
forever
now
And
pull
the
blackout
curtains
down
Down
We
could
be
immortals
Just
not
for

We
could
be
immortals
Immortals
Immortals
Dad,
I
just
wish
I
could
share
You
mean
so
much
to
me,
and
honestly,
I've
always
felt
a
distance
what
with
you
being
and
I
just
wish
you
could
see
how...
MAN:
Fred.
Son.
Dad?
I
wear
'em
front,
I
wear
'em
back.
BOTH:
I
go
inside
out,
Dad!
We
have
a
lot
to
talk
about.
