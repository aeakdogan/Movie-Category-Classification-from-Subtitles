Let's
see
how
you

I
think
I'm
up
to
the
challenge.
All
right,
will
you
save
me

Maybe.

Go

Don't

you.
Hi.
You're

Thirty

Yeah,

Hm?

Congratulations,
Mr.

Secretary

Hi,
John.
...I
enjoyed
your

paper
You've
read
my

paper?
I
read
it
while
I
was
A
sailor?
-
Good
man,
take
a
seat.
You
didn't
happen
to
catch
my
speech...

the
Paraguayan

Are
you
kidding
me?
Your
argument
for
the
inverse

Now,
if
we
can
just
get

Yes.
Well
put.
"Shortsighted."
John,
what
do
you
say
you
and
I
head
out
-
Stogies?
Why
not?
It's
just
that
we
lost
a
lot
I'm
sorry.
Gloria,
I
think
I
gotta
Thank
you
so
much

the

I
wish
I
were
stronger.

CLEARY:
John,
you
seem
like
an
astute
man.
Maybe
you
can
help
See
that
young
man
JOHN:
Sure.
Twenty-two
years
old,
Every
advantage
in
life,
Well,
that's
not
exactly
true.
He
had
the
same
advantages
I
had,
So
here's
my
question:
What's
he
got
to
be
so
morose
about?
Maybe
he
hasn't
found
Oh,
he
says
he
believes
in
art.
But
all
I've
seen
him
do...
...is
dribble
his
own
blood
on
a
canvas
-
You
know,
some
people
call
that
art.
What
about
having
a
public
service,
Well,
maybe
he's...
Maybe
he's
just
trying
to
find
I
mean,
you
cast
a
pretty
big
shadow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
perhaps...

should
take
it
easier
on
him.
Perhaps.

Half

Come
on,
they're
here
...they're
in
the
presence
of
true

Because
they
wanna
believe
in
true
love.
What's
true
love?
True
love
is
your
soul's
recognition
Well,
it's
a
little
cheesy,
but
I
like
it.
I
saw
it
on
a
bumper
sticker.

-
So
you
gonna
give
a
toast?
-
You
nervous?
-
What
are
you
gonna
say?
-
You
keep
it
in
your
cleavage.
Normally,
I'm
not
very
good
at
these
things,
"I
never
thought
my
sister
...who
cared
about
what
other
people
...until
I
met
Craig"?
That's
funny.
You
know,
people
like
funny.
I
know.
But
the
whole
...only
works
if
the

"Everyone

think
that

Nope.
Mm-mm.

I'm

so,
after

uh,
I

...for
sending
me
a

I
love
you,

I
never
thought
my

...what
other
people
thought
Uh...
As
you
all
know,
...at
big
law
firms
in
New
York.
But
that's
not
the
only
thing
They
both
like
the

green...
...like
Craig's

and
money.
Um,
heh...
You
know,
someone
once
told
me
that...
...true
love
is...
...the
soul's
recognition
And
I
think
that
And
I
think
it's
something
to
be
valued.
And
I'm
just
really
happy
Congratulations,
Chris.


Ah!

That
was
amazing!
We

No,

It's

So

No,

Like
what?
Give

And
then
they
make
it
into
cloth,
...then
make
little
shirts
and
pants...
...for
other
homeless
people
to
sell.
-
People
helping
people.
That's
very
admirable.
Thank
you.
Although
don't
make
me
out
We
do
turn
a
small
profit.
After
all,
someone

What's

obvious...
...but
what

get
Well,
that's
a
hell
of
a
good
project.
I'm
gonna
mention
something
That

Terrific,

Isn't

That
must
have
been
so
thrilling.

My

FDR

a
wonderful
President.
MARY:
The

Eleanor?

Big

Huge

Grandma,

Somebody

Okay.
Oh,

What

I
know.
Todd,
I
noticed

I

CLEARY:
Actually,
Todd
is
an
amazing
painter.
He's
going
to
the
Rhode
Island
JOHN:
Oh,
that's
a
great
school.
That's
really
impressive.
RISD.
Yeah,
Dad

Now,
Todd.
Actually,

Oh,

William,
Okay.

Excuse

from
the
delicious

I
just
had
my
tits
done.
You

Those

like
lovely

William
doesn't
give
a

about
my
tits.
Well,

But,
Mrs.

TODD:
Did
you
say
something,
Todd?
Mom

you
feel
her

Todd,
where
are
you
going
with
this?
Just

Some
friend
of
my
sister's...
...she
said
something
to
my
dad
...he
now
lives
in
a
shack
in
Guam.
Not

Stop
kidding
with

Todd.
Come

Are

kidding?
That
was
so
funny.

No,

Really?
...who

he's
part

Doesn't

that
great.

No,

Okay.
CLAIRE:
Are
you
okay?
Well,

a
toilet.
What

think?
Honey,
it's
okay
to
be
vulnerable
Yeah,
you

We

I
would
have
noticed
I
made
you
a

What?
TODD:
It's
sexual
and
violent.
I
thought
you
might
like
it.
No.

CLEARY:
Where's

coming
from?

Hide!
You

Yes.

Not

Everything

was
just
having
a
bad

sometimes.
You

Okay,

Sleep

There's
nothing
terrifying
Now,

if
you
let

That'd
be
awesome.

Yeah.
Gorilla.

Rhino.
That'll
get

Yes!
JOHN:
Come

JOHN:
MAN

Randolph.
I'm
watching
my
stories,
man.
Is
that
what
you
get
paid
to
do?
It's
exactly
what
I
get
paid
to
do.
Look,
I
want
to
know
where
Claire
is.
She
took
a
bike
ride
down
to
the
beach.
With
who?
With
that
fella
from
the
wedding
CLAIRE:
What
does
that
mean?
JOHN:
Oh,
it's
really
not
that
CLAIRE:
JOHN:
Well,
no,
it's
just...
...and
you
go
down
a
road
And
then
you
get
caught
up
in
it
...and
just
don't
even
have
time
And
before
you
know
it,
you're
living
a
life
...or
that
you
intended
to.
Do
you
know
what
I
mean?
Yes,
I
do.
I
think
that
there's
some
great
things
...that
maybe
I'm
capable
of,
hopefully.
Oh,
yeah?
Like
what?
I
don't
know.
We'll
see.
I'm
still
young.
Well...
...you're
not
that
young.
I'm
sorry.
Give
me
your
hands.
I
know
this

Okay.
JOHN:
Do
you
want
full
speed
or
half
speed?
Full.
You're
never
gonna
hit
me,
CLAIRE:
What?
You
didn't
approve
of
that?
No,
because
you're
supposed
to...

You
gotta
wait
until
I
put
them
back.
Come
on.
So,
what
about
you,
with
Sack?
Is
that
a
good
thing?
Yes,
I
think
it's
a
good
thing.
You
don't
sound
very
enthused.
I
am.
Well,
I
mean,
I
think
I
am.
I...
I'm...
Okay.
I...
You
know,
we've
just
been
...and,
uh,
I
mean,
I
always
assumed
But...
I'm
scared.
I
am.
But
that
that's
how
everyone
feels
I
mean,
don't
you
think?
Yeah,
no.
Don't
answer
that.
That's
my
rationalization
Fair
enough.
And
I
don't
mean
to
pry.
Yes,
you
did.
Well,
however
it
works
out,
Um...
I
hope
you
realize
that
I
have
an
announcement.
I
know
that
we
said

You
win
some,
-
No,
I'm
not...
I
can't
do
that.
Look,
I
think
I'm
in
love
with
her.
Yeah,
I
think...
I
think
that
you're
nuts.
I'm
gonna
tell
her
the
truth.
Jesus
Christ!
-
Hey.
How
are
you?
Okay,
listen,
Gloria,
...that
you're
an
amazing
person,
...but
I
feel
like
I
have
I
really
don't
see
this
relationship
-
But
I
love
you.
You'll
learn
as
time
goes
on
...between
infatuation
and
love,
Obviously,
you're
gonna
have
...because
you
lost
your
virginity
to
me...
...but
that
doesn't
mean...
-
What?
Far
from
it.
I
just
thought
that
that's
what
guys
Come
on.
Jeremy.
Wow
Hello,
son.
-
You
okay?
No
offense
to
you,
I
think
we
might
be
I
think
you'd
just
be
But
have
a
little
No
one
likes
to
drink
alone.
There
you
go,
get
your
hands
on
it.
I'm
gonna
pour
till
it's
on
the
tray.
Can
I
ask
you
a
question,
Father?
You
ever
get
horny?

I'm
sure
you
do.
But
I
guess
in
your
...sleep
with
anybody,
right?
Does
that
get
tough
sometimes?
Do
you
ever
pull
on
yourself
or...?
Everything
works?
-
Do
you
get
swelled
up
still?
-
Well,
what
do
you
do?
Yeah,
I
pray
too,
you
know
what
I
mean?
She's
good.
I
mean,
I
believed
that
she
was
a
virgin.
It
hurts
to
be
lied
to
like
that.
It's
a
horrible
feeling
to
feel
that
way.
But
I
was
looking
So
could
I
really
feel
that
bad?
It's
not
like
I
was
who
I
was.
And
let's
be
honest
here,
okay?
Let's
put
all
the
cards
on
the
table.
She's
fucked
three
ways
And
you
wanna
know
what?
Yeah.
It
turns
me
on.
You
wanna
know
Maybe
I'm
a
little
fucking
crazy.
Maybe
I'm
a
little
cuckoo.
I
know
it's
a
surprise.
I
had
an
imaginary
friend
when
I
was
a
kid.
We
used
to
play
checkers
...and
bless
his
heart,

And
that
ain't
normal.
Maybe
that's
what
it
takes
to
make
you
feel
I
know
when
that
redhead
...that
something
about
me
I
dig
talking
with
you.
...and
I
like
that
about
you.
Okay,
come
in
for
the
real
thing.
-
Get
in
here
for
the
real
thing.
I
love
you.
You're
a
sweet
man.
Oh,
dear
God.
You
can't
marry
this
guy.
Why?
Because
I've
fallen
for
you.

WOMAN:
Oh,
this
is
wonderful.
Good
news
travels
fast.
Excuse
me.
I'm
just
gonna
take
this.
Trapster,
talk
to
me.
No
shit.
And
do
you
maybe
feel
the
same
way?
-
Maybe.
That's
all
I
needed
to
know.
But
this
is
crazy,
-
Why?
-
What
do
you
mean?
...and
you
have
a
crazy
brother...
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
It's
not
a
big
deal...
...but
maybe
you
wanna

Run!
Johnny!
She's
trying
to
kill
me!
-
Grandma!
Put
the
gun
down!
Mother,
stop!
This
is
the
real
world,
lady!
You
can't
just
go
MAN:
-
What
did
you
do?
-
That
was
a
confession.
Why
don't
you
tell
her,
John?
-
I
don't
know
what's
going
on.
-
I'm
playing
catch-up,
too.
CLAIRE:
Sack,
what
are
you
doing?
-
You
remember
yet?
SACK:
They're
not
who
-
Those
aren't
even
their
real
names.
-
Everything
he
told
you
is
a
lie.
Claire,
they
crash
weddings.
They
crash
weddings
Everything
that
they
have
told
us
-
No,
you're
joking.
-
Sack,
will
you
just
stop?
CLAIRE:
Is
that
true?
No,
it's
a
yes-or-no
question.
I
know,
but
it's
complicated.
CLAIRE:
Yes
or
no?
Yes.
With
shades
of
gray.
I'm
not
perfect,
but
who
are
we
kidding?
And
you
wanna
know
what?
I
dig
it.
Jeremy
tried
to
seduce
me!
You
did?
I
want
my
painting
back.
The
painting
was
a
gift,
Todd.
I'm
taking
it
with
me.
You
had
me
going,
son.
I
thought
it
was
something
special.
There's
a
ferry
leaving
in
10
minutes.
I
suggest
you
be
on
it.
Come
on,
let's
go.
-

I
want
you.
He
made
a
fool
out
of
you,
Claire.
Come
on,
let's
go.
Sweetheart.
Now
bunch
those
panties
up
Put
that
little
ball
right
in
your
mouth.
-
Hang
up
the
phone.
And
I
will
definitely
-
Come
on,
wrap
it
up.
What
the
fuck?
-
I
know
how
I
can
get
to
her.
I
know
how
I
can
get
to
Claire.
Oh.
John,
you
gotta
drop
this
thing.
It's
been
months,
She
hasn't
returned
your
phone
calls,
-
She
didn't
respond
to
the
candygram.
God
knows
what
happened
She
didn't
keep
it
and
I
know
-
Okay.
...at
this
juncture
that
she
just
flat
out
I
disagree.
Now,
look,
they're
having
...for
her
tonight
at
the
Burke's
club.
I'm
not
g...
John,
I
can't...
Okay,
okay,
listen
to
me.
-
Listen
to
me.
I
can't
go.
Because
I
can't
go,
because
I
have
What
is
your
deal?
For
the
past
couple
months
I
can't
find
you,

myself
on
the
line,
Your
goddamn
negativity.
I
thrive
on
enthusiasm.
Don't
take

you
know
I
love
you,

we
gotta
look
at
reality
here.
There's
gonna
be

in

You're
so
cautious.

ahead
of

for
your
own
good,

I'm
gonna
Okay.
JOHN:
Hey,
how
do
I
look?
-
Good.
Late,
as
usual.
Is
Claire...?
-
Oh,
she's
looking
fine.
SACK:
Next
thing
you
know
they
pick
me
...and
they
start
chanting,
...they
thought
I
was
God.
And
I'll
tell
you
something,
CLEARY:
Let's
dance.


SACK:
You.

Let's
go,
sport.
Whoa,
hold
it.
Sack!
Okay,
Sackmaster,
one
more.
You're
right.
You
get
near
my
fiance
again...
...I'll
kill
you.
Let
me
say
one
thing.
You
check
out
the
rack
Hey,
you're
the

Oh,
my
God...
JOHN:

Goddamn
it.
Perfect.
Johnny,
wait
a
second.
Come
on,
John!
Oh,
what
time
is
it?
John,
will
you
wait
a
second
Hold
on,
man.
Will
you
stop?
I'm
not
gonna
chase
you
-
Hold
on
a
second.
Let
me
talk
to
you.
About
how
you
left
me
high
and
dry
Sack
did
that
to
you?
How
long
you
been
sneaking
I
wanted
to
tell
you
about
Gloria.
And
I'm
sorry
that
you
had

like
giving

Yeah!
Get

Claire.
Hi.
Thanks
for
coming.

1:
Hey!

You're
supposed
to

Love

Jeremy.
Jeremy!
I
am
so
ready
to
take
it
Do
you
wanna
watch
me
with
a
girl?
What
about
those
Brazilian
twins
I
was...
I
was
thinking
more
along
the
lines
But
that
sounds
terrific.
The
Brazilian
girls
were
very
nice.
Oh,
Jeremy,
I
do!
-
I
love
you.
I
can't

of
these
do
you
like?
Um...
Well,
I
could
go
with

and
freesias
and
orchids...

I
could
go
with
a
votive

have
no
way
of
knowing
All
we
can

bad
about

a
lot
to
me.
I

at

been
my
friend

need
you
there
to
be
my
best
man.
Kindly
leave.

come
over,

gotta
be
honest,

come
in,

like...
There's
cartoons,

mom,
Look
at
her.
I
will
have
some
meatloaf.

You
want
some?
I
knew
you'd
come...
Hey,
Mom!
The
meatloaf!
We
want
it
now!
The
meatloaf!
What
is
she
doing?
I
never
know
"Just
living
the
dream."

She's
hot.

sorry,

don't...

not
judging
you,

there's
no
way

time
to
plant,
and
a
time

time
to
kill

a
time
to
heal.

time

break

A
time
to
weep
and
a
time
to
laugh.

A
time
to
cast
away
stones...

you,

Oh!

you,

Damn
it!

you!
I'm
in
pain.

to
fight
it.
Try
to
fight
it.

don't
know
about

people,

know

is
no
good
in

to
rejoice

that
which
befalleth

one
thing
befalleth...
...as
the
one
dieth,
so
dieth
the
other.
Yea,
they
all
have
one
breath...
...so
that
a
man
hath
no
preeminence
While
each
man
thinks
he
knows
love...
...love,
we
have
learned,
is
a
mystery.
That's
what
makes
today
so
special.
We
witness
two
people
...ones
they
truly
love.

Whoa,
whoa,
hey!
Hey!
Hey!
He's
the
best
man.
Yeah.
Thank
you.
I
don't
believe
this.
Hat
in
hand.
I'm
sorry
I'm
late.
I'm
glad
you're
here.
And
I'm
sorry
I
called
you
white
trash.
-
John,
apology
accepted.
And
I'm
sorry
I
called
you
a
hillbilly,
John,
it's
okay.
Do
you
mind
if
I
get
married
now?
-
No,
go
ahead.
Hi,
Todd.
Although
we
may
choose
...we
don't
always
choose...

Claire,
I'm
not
here
to
Don't
worry
about
me.

I'm
not
a
nut.
You
look
really
pretty,
by
the
way.
I
can't
stop
thinking
about
you.
It's
all
I
think
about
JEREMY:
Ahem.
O'NEIL:
God,
I
miss
you.


Claire,
will
you
wait
just
a
second?
All
I
wanted
was
a
second
alone
But
I've
never
gotten
that
chance.
Maybe
I
don't
deserve
it.
So
here
goes.
For
longer
than
I
care
to
remember,
I
crashed
weddings
to
meet
girls.
Business
was
good.
I
met
a
lot
of
girls.
And
it
was
childish,
it
was
juvenile...
And
pathetic.
Yeah,
that's
probably
But
you
know
what?
So
it's
hard
for
me
And
that
person
that
you
met
back
Maybe
not
my
name...
-
Or
my
job...
...but
the
feelings
we
felt...
...the
jokes,
the
stupid
laughs,
I've
changed.
I've
realized
something.
-
I
crashed
a
funeral
earlier,
and
I...

Oh,
Jesus.
It
wasn't
my
idea.
I
went
with
Chazz,
who
you
forgot
He
also
might
be
a
genius,
because
CLAIRE:
John.
That's
neither
here
nor
there.
And
I
see
this
widow
and
she's
a
wreck.
She's
just
lost
the
person
And
I
realized
we're
all
gonna
That's
the
way
it
is.
But
not
me,
not
right
now.
Because
the
person
I
love
the
most
...and
I'm
not
ready
to
lose
you
yet.
Claire,
I'm
not
standing
here
I'm
just
asking
you...
...not
to
marry
him.
And
maybe
take
a
walk.
Take
a
chance.
Wow.
Wow!
This
congregation
really
doesn't
care
about
Claire,
baby,
could
you
go
back
up
I'm
sorry.
I
am.
SACK:
I
can't
marry
you.

Secretary...
...your
daughter's
a
little...
Sack,
