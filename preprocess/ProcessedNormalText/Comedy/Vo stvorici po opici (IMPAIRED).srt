He's
actually
kinda
funny.
I'll
hit
an
old
man
Is
he
all
there...
I
think
so,
he's
just
an
odd
guy

Alright.
Tracy
did
mention
that
we
shouldn't

It's
thirty-two-fifty,
It
says
here
we
should
work
in

I
don't
think
you
should
be
doing
Gambling?
Who
said
anything
It's
not
gambling
when
you
know
Counting
cards
-
It's
also
illegal.
It's
frowned
upon,
like...
I'm
pretty
sure
Yeah,
maybe
after...
9/11,
Thanks
a
lot,
Bin
Laden.
Either
way,
you
gotta
be
super
smart

Dr.
Price?
Stu,
you're
a
dentist.

not
fancy
if
it's
true.
And
if,
uh,
someone
has
a
heart
attack,
We'll
be
sure
to
do
that.
Can
I
ask
you
a
question?

I'm
not
getting
a
sig'
on
my
beeper.

pay-phone
bank?

a
phone
in
your
room.
Sir,
I

you
have
any
villas
available.

It's
no
big
deal,
we
can
If
we

Figure
it
out
yourself,
okay?
What

the
baby?
Just

him
in
the
car.

We're
not
leaving
a
baby

Um...
Do
you
remember
Uh...
I
haven't
seen
him
The
wedding.
Okay.
And,
uh...
-
What
time
was
that
at?
I
guess
it
was
around
one.
Because
I
had
to
go
back
And
then
when
I
got
out,
I
headed
And
was
Doug
there
then?
I
didn't
see
Doug.
The
room
was
a
wreck.
So
I
just
curled
up
-
Ah'ha.
I
got
a
question.
Um...
You
said
when
your
shift
ended.
Or
a...
blackjack
dealer?
-
You
know
this.
I'm
a
stripper.
Well,
technically
but
stripping
is
a
great
way
Smart.
Savvy.
But
that's
all
in
the
past,
I'm
just
a
dentist.
-
Police.
Freeze!
Shut
that
baby
up.
Okay.
So,

okay?
I'm
just
worried.
What

so
upset
Oh.
How

he
die?
-
World
War
II.
No,
he
was
skiing
in
Vermont.

I'll
tell
you
another
thing.
6

how
much
you
wanna
bet?
It's
like
That's
enough,
Stu.
Alan
is
seriously
worried,
okay?
I'm
sorry,
Alan.
We'll
search
the
car
for
clues,
Oh,
shit.
I
can't
look.
-
Wow.
You
see!
It's
gonna
be
alright.
-
Anything?
Oh,
I
found...
uh,
-
Are
they
women
shoes?
-
Who's
are
those?
That's
weird.
Oh,

this
snake
skin?
Oh,

Ooohhh...
-
It's
a
used
condom,
Alan.
Get
it
outta
the
car.
Come

Alan.
I

that
shit
on
me
now.
Jesus
Fucking
Christ.
Get

out.
Oh,
my
god.
All
Right.
We

that?
It's
in
the
trunk.
Doug's

the
trunk.
No,

Holy
shit.
-
Open
it!
Open
it!
-
Stop!
Please
stop.
-
Okay.
Whoa...
I'm
with
you.
You
gonna
fuck
on
me?
Nobody's
gonna
fuck
on
you.
We're
on
your
side.
I
hate
Godzilla.
I
hate
him.
Please.
This
isn't
your
fault.
What
the
fuck
was
that?
I've
got
internal
bleeding.
Please
call
911.
That's
some
fucked
up
shit.
Guys,
there's
something
Last
night
on
the
roof,
I
slipped
something
What?
I'm...
I'm
sorry.
You
drugged
us?
No,
I...
I
didn't
drug
you.
Who
told
you
it
was
ecstasy?
The
guy
I
bought
it
from
Why
would
you
give
us
ecstasy?
Because
I
wanted
everybody
and
I
knew
you
guys
It
was
just
one
hit
each.
I
used
to
do
3
hits
at
night.
But
it
wasn't
ecstasy,
Alan.
You
think
I
knew
that,
Stu?
The
guy
I
bought
it
from
seemed
like
I'm
sorry.
You
mean
the
drug
dealer
-
Let's
just
calm
down.
He
drugged
us.
I
lost
a
tooth.
How
dare
you.
-
You're
such
a
fucking
moron.
Fuck
you.
Alright,
let's
just
take
Alright,
seriously,
At
least
not
some
stranger
-
for
god
knows
what
reason.
Yeah,
you're
right,
Phil.
We're
so
much
better
off
now.
Here's
something,
I
would
Our
best
friend,
Doug,
is
probably
With
a
meth
head,
-
That's
highly
unlikely.
That
doesn't
help.
Alright,
let's
get
Let's
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
Maybe
Doug's
back
there.
Come
on!
Stu,
a
little
help?
Shut
up.
Oh,
god.
Alan,
I'm
sorry.
Wait,
guys.
Guys...
-
What
if
he
got
out?
I
keep
forgetting
about
How
the
fuck
I
don't
know.
Shh...
Stu,
One
of
the
side-effects
of...
You're
literally
-
Thank
you.
Hey,
come
on.
Did
we
leave
the
music
on?
Hey.
Don't
make
any
sudden
moves.

hell
are
you?
Quiet,
quiet!

can
feel

coming
The

guys.
Oh,
Lord.
'Cause
I've
been
waiting
for
One
more
time,
guys.
Oh,
Lord.
Oh,
Jesus.
Oh,
fuck.
Why
did
you
do
that?
Mr.
Tyson
would
like
to
know
why
Hold
on,
hold
on.
That
was
I...
I'm
a
huge
fan.
...
that
was...
Hey,
look...
We
were
drugged
last
night,
It's
true.
We
got
into
all
And
now
we
can't
find
our
friend.
And
if
you
wanna
kill
us,
just
go
ahead,
-
Stu,
what're
you
talking
about?
Why
the
fuck
would
you
We
tend
to
do
dumb
shit
I
don't
believe
Wait
a
minute,
One
of
you
dropped
your
jacket,
found
it
in
the
That's
Doug's.

would
Respect.
What...
Don't
worry
about
Omar.
Okay...
I
know
this
is
asking
a
lot,
that
we
could
go
to
your
house
if
there's
any
clues
Absolutely.
How
else
you
think
we're
Come
on,
Champ.
What...
I'm
sorry?
We're
not
gonna
put
it
in
the
Bentley.
What'd
you
think?
Don't
make
me
come
back
for
him.
That
was
Mike
Tyson.
Yeah,
no
shit
I'm
just
saying,
-
Hey,
you
okay?
Fuck,
where
did
he
get
him
at?
It
does
not
seem
fair.
Rock,
paper,
scissors.
Alan
should
do
it.
Alan
took
a
punch
Come
on,
for
Doug.
Why
are
you
peppering
the
steak.
You
don't
know
Tigers
love
pepper.
Phil,
just
do
it.
I
would,
but
you
lost.
Okay,
I
jammed
Just
go
in
there
Fine.
Make
sure
