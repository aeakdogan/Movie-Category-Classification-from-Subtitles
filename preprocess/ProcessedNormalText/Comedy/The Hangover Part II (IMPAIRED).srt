RECEPTIONIST
:
The
office
will
be
closed
until
the
24th.


STU
:
I'm
getting
married,
so
I'll
be
out
I'm
not
sure
if
I'll
have
cell
service.
Nothing.

Daddy,
please.
You're
not
helping.

I
looked
into
his
eyes.
The
eyes
of
a
coward.


Excuse
me.
-
Phil.
I'm
sorry.
Where
the
hell
are
you?
It
happened
again.
Don't
say
that.
Please.
No,
this
time
we
really
fucked
up.
Seriously,
what
is
wrong
So
much,
Trace,
TRAC
Y:
Like
no
wedding
bad?
Yeah.
Little
worse
than
that.
Mm-hm.
You
really
need
to
floss
more.
Fuck
that.
That's
why
I
come
here.
Then
you
should
come
more
than
-
So
you
could
bleed
me
of
all
my
money?
-
Hey,
how
do
I
work
the
nitrous?
Come
on.
Just
one
hit.
Fillings
look
pretty
good.
Yeah,
actually.
For
starters,
that's
flights
for
me
My
mother-in-law's
watching
the
kids.
Now
she's
got
this
whole
new
thing
Plus
it
takes
five
days
to
get
there.
It's
a
16-hour
flight.
-
Whatever.
It's
a
hassle.
Lauren's
been
there
a
week
It's
where
her
parents
are
from.
Who
gives
a
shit
about
her
parents?
He
doesn't
hate
me.
He's
just
never
spoken
to
me.
Why
can't
you
get
married
in
Vegas
Why
can't
you
just
be
excited
for
me?
This
is
my
wedding.
You're
really
happy,
huh?
I
really
am.
All
right.
I'm
happy
too.
Thank
you.
It's
gonna
be
fun.

Phil?
Put
the
prescription
pad
back.
Thank
you.
Fuck
you,
man.
-
Was
this
right
up
against
your
scrotum?
TRAC
Y:
Oh,
my
God.
I
just
realized.
TRAC
Y:
Oh,
no.
Good
thing
I
did
it
last
week.
You're
the
best.
Hey,
we're
a
team.
No,
I
mean,
you
are
a
good
guy.
Thank
you.
So
I
know
you're
not
gonna
get
mad.
Mad?
What...?
Mad
at
what?
Alan
found
out
that
we're
going
So?
So
he's
heartbroken,
Doug.
No,
your
family
is
like
his
family.
All
Alan
talks
about
is
the
three
of
you.
Wait.
Is
he
the
one
that
keeps
calling
He
does
that
when
he's
upset.
He
doesn't
Could
you
just
run
it
by
Stu?
Just
run
it
by
him.
For
me?
STU:
Absolutely
not.
Come
on,
Stu.
It's
killing
him.
I
don't
care.
Honestly,
the
two
of
you
PHIL:
Oh.
Just,
you
know
what?
Alan
considers
you
I
consider
Alan
to
be
insane.
PHIL:
His
dad
pays
We
should
squeeze
the
old
man
That's
good.
I'm
glad
you
brought
that
up,
-
What?
Yeah.
It's
my
bachelor
brunch.
Go
crazy.
Get
some
chocolate-chip
That's
bullshit.
Ha,
ha.
You
can't
just
You
see
that?
Do
you
know
why?
Well,
I
refuse
to
eat
fucking
cantaloupe
Come
on.
No,
I
don't.
I'm
still
putting
the
broken
pieces

And
you
know
what
the
glue
is?
Lauren.
And
I'm
not
doing
anything
-
You
wouldn't
be
with
her
if
not
for
us.
Stu,
think
about
it.
Two
years
later,
You
take
Vegas
out
of
that
equation,
It's
okay.
I'm
allowed
to
say
it.
Drink
up,
everybody.
Wait,
there's
no
alcohol.
Well,
it's
my
decision
and
it's
final,
-
This
sucks.
I'm
gonna
wait
in
the
car.
I
just
don't
get
it.
That's
great
for
him,
but
what
about
us?
Come
on,
sweetheart.
Shame
on
you.
Don't
worry,
Stu.
Thank
you.
But
you
gotta
help
me
out
SID:
Guys,
I
can't
tell
you
Alan's
been
waiting
for
the
invite
I'm
sure
he
has.
Yeah,
he's
been
standing
outside
-
Wow,
that's
rough.
I'm
not
quite
sure
he
ever
left
Vegas,

ALAN:
Sweetie,
it's
Pa
Pa.
You
have
visitors.
Go
in
slowly,
DOUG:
Hey,
guys.
-
Hey,
Phil.

-
Sure.
-
Hey.
Hey.
-
Hey,
Stu.
Pretty
cool
room,
Alan.
Oh,
thanks,
Phil.
My
dad
pays
my
rent.
Alan,
what
the
fuck?
We
were
supposed
to
delete
these.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
What
the
hell?
I'm
not
cool
with
this
at
all.
PHIL:
Ha,
ha.
Total
violation
of
trust.
Mother,
I'm
done
with
my
lunch.

LINDA
:
ALAN:
Can't
believe
you
stopped
by.
Wait
a
second.
Al,
is
that
Mr.
Chow?
Yeah.
We
still
keep
in
touch.
Stu.
-
The
guy
that
kidnapped
us?
He
kidnapped
Black
Doug.
Remember?
It
was
a
whole
big
misunderstanding.

-
Alan,
he's
a
criminal.
-
Hi,
Linda.
I
guess
we
don't
do
dessert
anymore.
Well,
I'm
sorry,
darling.
I'll
be
right
back.
Would
a
cupcake
kill
you?
-
I
don't
think
this
was
a
good
idea.
Stu
would
like
to
invite
you
Well,
only
if
you're
not
busy.
Stu.
Well,
maybe
the
Jonas
Brothers
No.
They're
in
Raleigh-Durham
STU:
Are
you
really
being
serious,
Stu?
Yeah,
why
not?
Could
be
fun,
right?
-
Phil,
are
you
going?
Then
it
will
be
fun.
STU:
Ah!
It's
my
immunizations.
That's
supposed
to
be
done
I
am
a
nurse.
I'm
just
not
registered.
Oh,
Stu,
look
at
this.
I
bought
this
because
I
thought
of
you.
STU:
Hey,
there
he
is.
-
Teddy.
What's
up?
How
are
you?
STU:
All
right.
This
is
Teddy,
Lauren's
little
brother.
Goes
to
Stanford.
Premed.
DOUG:
Hey,
nice
to
meet
you,
man.
TEDD
Y:
I'm...
Actually,
I'm
16.
And
I'm
not
a
genius.
My
dad
just
had
me
Because
you're
a
genius.
-
So,
what
are
you,
a
doctor?
Ever
heard
of
that
guy
Doogie
Howser?
-
Yeah.
-
Alan.
Right.
Okay,
well,
I'm
gonna
grab
a
book
You
guys
want
anything?
-
No,
thanks.
I
would
actually
love
a
Smartwater.
Cool.
Thanks.
-
What's
the
matter
with
you?
He's
16.
I'm
a
little
confused.
-
How
does
this
work?
Is
that
person
coming
to
the
wedding?
Yes,
Alan.
My
bride's
little
brother
Is
that
okay
with
you?
Well,
it's
just
the
first
time
I've
heard
of
it.

Don't
overreact.
It's
gonna
be
fine.
Hey.
Mind
if
I
sit?
-
Wolf
pack
only.
Find
another
chair.
-
Come
on.
-
Don't
be
ridiculous.
You're
sitting
here.
That
is
a
Louis
Vuitton.
TEDD
Y:
That's
a
nice
neck
roll.
Thanks.
You
can
use
it
if
you
want.
Okay.
LAUREN:
STU:
-
How
was
your
trip?
STU:
This
is
so
absolutely
beautiful.
Of
course.
Between
Teddy
and
me,
Pretty
soon
you'll
have
two
doctors
You
have
to
realize
that
in
my
country,
we
Dad.
Okay.
Anyway,
I
have
to
go
and
talk
to
Teddy
See
you.
-
Ouch.
Your
dad's
kind
of
obsessed
LAUREN:
It's
always
been
that
way.
He'll
warm
up.
I
promise.
Okay?
ALAN:
If
you
just
fax
it
over
to
me,
Okay.
Ha,
ha.
Thanks,
Pa
Pa.
Bye-bye.
That
was,
uh,
my
dad.
We
were
discussing
your
wedding
gift.
Oh,
that's
so
unnecessary.
I've
been,
uh,
meaning
to
ask.
Is
there
a
Long
John
Silver's
You
know,
no,
I
don't
think
so.
But
we
are
actually
serving
-
Better
than
Long
John's?
I'll
be
the
judge
of
that.
You
too.
Okay.

All
right.
Thank
you,
Teddy.
The
hands
of
a
brilliant
musician...
...and
one
day,
a
great
surgeon.
I
admit
it.
When
I
first
met
Stu,
[STU
SNICKERS
He
seemed
unattractive.
He
lacked
intelligence
and
imagination.
He
was
missing
that
spark
But
then
I
look
into
Stu's
eyes.
He
reminded
me
of
my
sweet
brother,
For
those
who
do
not
know...
...Chaiyo
is
learning-disabled

But
Chaiyo
loves
chok.
And
that's
when
I
realized...

...Stu
is
chok.

Chok
is
soft
white
rice
It
has
no
taste.
We
feed
it
to
small
baby
It
is
nourishment
The
world
needs
chok.
Just
as
the
world
needs
people
like
Stu.
To
my
sweet
daughter
and
Stu.
PHIL:
Hear,
hear.
And
now
I
believe
that
Teddy
Sit
down.
I
got
this.
Sit
down,
boy.
That
was,
uh,
a
great
speech,
sir.
I
like
the
comparisons
between,
uh,
I've
also
prepared
a
few
words.
"Hey,
everybody,
The
population
in
Thailand
It
is
twice
the
size
of
Wyoming.
Its
chief
exports
are
textiles,
Each
year,
approximately
13,000
people
-
The
climate
in
Thailand
is..."
Alan,
why
don't
you
skip
Okay.
Sorry.

"None
of
you
know
Stu
like
I
do."
Not
you.
Not
you.
Not
you.
Not
you.
Not
nobody
knows
Stu
like
I
do.
No
one.
"I
can't
even
tell
you
...because
we
made
a
pact
What
I
can
tell
you
is
this:
This
is
not
Stu's
first
marriage.
There
was
a
whore
in
Las
Vegas

All
right,
time's
up.
-
It
was
good.
I
did
good,
though.
-
Okay.
Thanks,
Phil.
In
your
face.
Well,
that
was
exactly
as
painful
Ha,
ha.
Sorry.
Oh,
rice
pudding!
What
are
you
doing?
Ha,
ha,
ha.
Very
funny,
Phil.
Be
nice,
Phil.
Get
over
it.
He's
your
father-in-law.
Come
have
a
drink
with
me
You
know,
I'm
really
exhausted.
I
spoke
with
the
manager.
That
sounds
fun.
Nah.
I'm
good.
He's
tired.
Stu.
One
drink
with
your
friends.
-
I
just
wanna
hang
out
with
you.
Take
Teddy
with
you.
He
never
gets
to
have
any
fun.
That
is
a
great
idea.
Bring
the
kid.
-
All
right.
One
drink.
-
See?
STU:
See
you
later.
STEPHANIE:
Got
your
key?
-
I'll
see
you
in
20
minutes.
My
Uncle
Roger
said
Really?
Polar
bears
are
white.
How
would
he
know
if
it's
an
albino?
This
one
was
black.
Did
you
ever
think
Whatevs.
-
Okay.
Here
we
go.
-
American
beer.
Sealed
bottles.
Thank
you.
All
right.
Um,
I'm
not
really
old
enough
to
drink.
Yeah,
it's
illegal.
Nobody's
reporting
anybody.
It's
fine,
Teddy.
Have
a
little
fun.
ALAN:
Careful.
What
is
this?
Roasting
marshmallows?
DOUG:
That
was
Alan's
idea.
You
know,
I
gotta
hand
it
to
you,
Stu.
Not
bad,
right?
And
I
can't
believe
I'm
saying
this,
I
mean,
Lauren
is
an
angel.
Yeah,
she
really
is
amazing.
Wow,
you
guys
are
sweet.
Not
big
breasts
on
her,
Sorry,
Teddy,
but
it's
true.
That's
okay.
That
is
just
wildly
inappropriate.
All
you
guys.
Even
you,
Alan.
It
means
a
lot
that
you
made
the
trip.
Wouldn't
miss
it,
buddy.
Great.
Now
can
we
have
our
Mm-hm.
All
right.
Toast.
Come
on,
stand
up,
guys.
Come
over
here,
Alan.
To
Lauren
and
Stu.
-
You
did
it,
buddy.
ALL:

What
the
hell?




What?
ALAN:

Phil?
I
think
it's
happened
again.
Alan,
what
the
fuck
did
you
do?
I
didn't
do
anything.
I
swear
to
God.
Your
hair
is
gone.
No,
no.
Up.

Where
the
fuck
are
we?





Stu,
come
on,
get
up.
We
got
a
situation.

Oh,
holy
shit.
Where
are
we?
Oh,
my
God,
Alan.
Your
head.
No,
your
head.
He's
bald.
Stu,
you're
gonna
freak
out,
Why?
What's...?
Is
it
my
teeth?
-
It's
not
your
teeth.
-
Are
you
sure?
-
Did
you
check
the
bottoms?
Oh,
my
God.
What
the
fuck?
Ow!
That's
good.
STU:
This
is
a
real
tattoo!
Alan,
what
did
you
do?
-
I
didn't
do
anything.
What
happened?


PHIL:
Oh,
jeez!
Help!
Back
there!
What
are
you?!
ALAN:
-
Oh,
what
the
hell?!
Look
at
the
cute
little
vest.
Alan.
Alan.
Butthole.


-
Phone.
Look,
Alan,
Alan,
go
find
the
phone.
I
got
it.
Doug.
Doug.
Where
the
hell
are
you?
I'm
at
breakfast.
By
the
pool.
Oh,
Jesus.
Thank
God.
Doug's
fine.
Stu,
Doug's
fine!
He's
at
the
resort.
Why
aren't
we
at
the
resort?
What's
going
on?
Where
are
you?
I
don't
know,
man.
We
woke
up
DOUG:
I
don't
know,
Doug.
Fucking
Asia
Town.
I
don't
know.
I
told
you.
Where
are
we?
PHIL:
ALAN:
Hey,
Stu.
Check
this
out.
You
ever
seen
anything
like
this?
-
What
is
that?
Might
be
a
spider's
nest.
I
don't
get
it,
man.
I
mean,
-
I
mean,
you
too.
PHIL:
Tracy
wasn't
feeling
well.
Wait
a
second.
Is
Teddy
with
you
guys?
PHIL:
Teddy?
What?
They've
been
looking
for
him
-
Teddy
went
to
Stanford,
right?
Fuck!

I
just
found
his
finger.
DOUG:
I
just
found
his
fucking
finger,
Doug.
Phil,
what
is
going
on?

This
is
what
we're
gonna
do.
...and
went
on
a
fishing
trip.
-
Right.
Shit!
PHIL:
What
is
that?
We
don't
know.
Is
it
a
worm?
It's
a
mushroom.
Yeah,
shiitake.
Monkey,
taste
it.
What
do
you
think?
He
can't
understand
you.
STU:
Why
is
he
pulling
on
it?
He's
probably
hungry.
Wait
a
second.
Is
that...?
CHOW:
Tell
that
gay
monkey
Chow?!
CHOW:
Ah,
so
fucking
light
in
here.
Alan.
Grab
me
my
sunglasses.
-
It's
great
to
see
you,
Leslie.
Chow,
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing
here?
Alan
called
me
a
few
days
ago
-
Excuse
me?
You
didn't
have
a
plus
one.
Guys,
guys.
Just
focus,
okay?
You
guys
texted
me,
said
you
fucked
up

I
picked
you
up
in
my
boat
And
we
had
a
sick
night,
bitches!
Whoa,
whoa.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Chow,
we're
in
Bangkok?
Holler!
City
of
squalor!
Do
you
know
how
I
got
this
tattoo?
Uh,
yeah.
From
a
fucking
tattoo
guy.
Come
on,
Stewie.
Hey,
what's
the
monkey
holding?

That's
a
finger!
PHIL:
Teddy
was
with
us
last
night.
That's
his
finger.
Teddy...
Teddy's
dead?
Ha,
ha.
Teddy
not
dead.
PHIL:
Don't
you
remember
anything?
-
No!
Okay,
okay.
I
explain
it
all,
okay?
Just
let
me
do
one
bump,
Come
to
papa.
-
Okay.
You
ready
for
craziest
fucking
story
of...
Chow.
Mr.
Chow,
are
you
okay?
You
gotta
be
kidding
me.
Fuck,
he's
dead.

-
Help!
-
Help!
Help!
Stu,
shut
up.
Stu,
shut
up!

-
Call
an
ambulance!
He's
dead.
Look,
if
someone
comes
and
...we'll
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
Alan.
Alan,
please
stop
crying.

All
right.
All
right!
STU:
This
is
the
worst
idea
ever.
ALAN:
"
Bangkok
is
the
capital
of
Alan,
put
the
cards
away
and
help.

Elevator.
ALAN:
What
the
fuck
is
the
deal
ALAN:
STU:
Come
on.
-
We
gotta
take
the
stairs.
Come
on.
Here
it
is.
Feet
first,
feet
first.
I've
done
this
before.
STU:
ALAN:

-
Stu.
We
still
have
to
find
Teddy.
Oh,
God.
The
roof!
-
Teddy!
-
Teddy!
Teddy!
ALAN:
-
You
guys
see
anything?
Come
on.
Where
are
you,
buddy?
He's
not
here.
I
can't
believe
this
is
happening

Okay.
Look,

this.
You

them
that
Alan
and
I
-
You
gotta
go
get
married.
I'm
not
going
back
without
Teddy.
It's
Lauren's
little
brother,
If
I
fuck
this
up...
...I
lose
everything.
Okay.
All
right.
Alan,
check
your
pockets.
-
What?
Come
on,
there
might
be
clues.
-
Check
your
phones.
Numbers,
texts.
-
I
got
nothing.
Fuck.
-
I
got
a
text
from
Chow.
Uh,
10:00
last
night.
What's
it
say?
"On
my
way,
niggas."
Oh,
niggas.
Okay.
Hip-hop.
We
are
so
fucked.

Hey,
Phil.
Look
who's
back.
Hi.
We
gotta
get
you
out

Yeah.
Yeah.
STU:
Phil,
I
really
think
we
should
go
PHIL:
For
what?
Report
a
dead
body
Are
we
gonna
keep
walking
in
circles?
I'm
trying
to
figure
this
out.
Well,
I'm
sorry.
It's

all
we've
done
is
buy
him
hats
What?
It's
a
bag
of

-
All
right,
what
do
you
wanna
do,
Stu?
-
Then
stop
yelling
at
me
like
it's
my
fault.

All
I
wanted
was
a
bachelor
brunch.
Shit.
Shut
up,
it's
Doug.
Talk
to
me.

got
off
the

Oh.
Thank
God.
Doug
found
him.

What
happened?
-
Arrested?
For
what?

Seriously?
They'll
release
him
to
you,
no
questions
He's
at
the,
uh...

Okay.
Okay,

We're

Yeah,

threw
him
in
the

Sixteen

No,

It's

Let

ask
you
something.
Does
he
look
like
he
works
out
at

Look,
we
arrest
a
lot
of

We
cannot

everything.
All

Well,
what

expect
us
to
do
Not
my

Hey,
guys?
I
think
he
knows
us.
Hi.
Hello.
Do
you
know
where
our
friend

Stu,

it.
The

He

something.
What
if

just
doesn't

out.

load?

marshmallows.

was
dark,

was
hard
to
keep
track,

couldn't
tell
which
was
which.

did
you
do
to
the
marshmallows,
Alan?
What
did
you
do?
Well,
isn't
it
obvious?
And,
plus,
my
ADHD
medication.

What?!
Not
you.
I
just
wanted
to
knock
out
Teddy
"Enjoy
the
weekend"?

you
told
me
Alan,
you
swore
to
God.
I
just
wanted
things
to
stay
the
same.
Look
at
my
face!
You
ruined
my
life!
You're
not
my
friend.
Don't
say
that,

Are
you
serious?

Yes!
Don't
start
crying,

bearded
devil!

liked
it.

smiled
at

when
Because
I
like

enough.
That's
enough.

can't
fall
apart

written
on
your
belly?
"Lebua

No.

tell
