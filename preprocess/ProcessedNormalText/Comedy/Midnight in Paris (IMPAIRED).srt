This
is
unbelievable!
There's
no
city
like
this
in
the
world.
You
act
like
you've
never
been
here
before.
I
don't
get
here
often
enough.
Can
you
picture
how
drop-dead
Imagine
this
town

'20s.
in
the
rain;
the
artists
and
writers.
Why
does
every
city
have
to
be
in
the
rain?
What's
wonderful
about
getting
wet?
I
mean,
could
you
ever
picture
us
Oh
God,
no.
I
could
never
live
out
of
the
United
States.
You
know,
if
I'd
stayed
here
and
written
novels,
and
not
gotten,
you
know,
caught
up
in
that,
I'll
tell
you
something:
I
would
drop
the
house
in
Beverly
Hills,
the
pool,
everything,
I
mean,
look:
We're
30
minutes
from
town.
Imagine
the
two
of
us
settling
here.
We
could
do
it,
I
mean,
You're
in
love
with
a
fantasy.
I'm
in
love
with
you.
We
should
get
back
to
town.
Let's
meet
'em.
There
are
our
sightseers.
If
I
never
see
another
charming
-
What
a
town!
I
could
see
myself
living
here!
I
feel
like
the
Parisians
kind
of
"get
me."
I
can
see
myself
just
strolling

know,

under
my
arm,
headed
to

What
did
Hemingway
say?
In
this

nothing

Well,
a
toast
to
John's
new
business

Cheers!

Congratulations.
Well,
I'll
be

you

blame

down

hole
in
Iraq.

The
whole
Bush,
you
know,...
-
bad
discussion
again
and
again.
fine
for
your
father
and
I
to
disagree.
That's
what
a
democracy
is.
Your
father
defends
the
right-wing
of
the
Republican
party,
and
I
happen
to
think
you
almost
got
to
be

like,
a
demented
lunatic,
but
it's
like...
But
it
doesn't
mean
we
don't

Can
we
talk
about
the
wedding
plans?
Let's
do
that.
-
Your
father
is
just...
-
Huh?
Carol?
Oh
my
G...
What
are
you
doing
here?
-
Nice
to
see
you!
Hi.
-
How
are
you?
Paul
and
Carol
Bates,
this
is
my
mother
-
and
father,
and,
of
course,
you
know
Gail.
Well,
you...
you
didn't
mention
No,
it
was
sudden.
Um...
Paul
got
invited
to
lecture
at
Oh,
how
wonderful!
Well,
uh,
Dad's
here
on
business,

along.
-
Yes.
That's
great.
We
can
spend
some
time
together.
Well,
I
think
we
have
a

What?
-
We're
driving
to
Verrsailles.

-
Versailles.
-
I'm
dying
to
see
Versailles.
But
it's
too...uh...
Tomorrow
we're
locked
in

Oh
no,
that's
just...
You
know
I
actually
had

saw
James
Joyce!
Yeah,
you
know,
like
a
apparently,
Joyce
was
eating
Is
that...
Well,
I
mean
it's
not
a
story.
-
We
would
LOVE
to
go
to
Versailles.
Yes.
I
hope
you're
not
going
to

How
was

brilliant.
You
know,
I
had
such
a
crush
on

Well,
he's
a
pseudo-intellectual.
-
Just
a
little
bit.
I
hardly
think
he'd
be

at
You
should
give
him
your
book
to

Oh,
come
on.
Why?
No,
because
he

maybe
show

Why

that?
I

Louis
moved
his
court
here,
uh,
in
1682.
Originally,
all
this
was
swampland.
In
fact,
if
I'm
not
mistaken,
uh...
in
Old
French,
the
word
"versailles"
means,
uh,
something
like,
-
"terrain

The...

The

I
believe,

Yes.

Yes,
that's
right.
I
could

like
this.

I
know
you
could.

remember:
in

Exactly.
Thank
you.
I
mean,
you
know,
the
problem
-
he
can
write
a
novel.
-
Well...
well,
everyone
loves
your
movies.
-
Yeah,
well
scripts
are
easier,
so...
Why
don't
you
tell
them
about
the

-
Yes!

-
Oh,
come
on.
Well,
dear,
you
don't
have
to
tell

No,
no,
no.
He
works
in
a

-
What's

What's
a

Shirley

-
And
I

buys

stuff.
Who'd
want
it?
-
I
don't
know.

Oh,
I
see!
And
no
global

no
TV
and
suicide
bombing,
and
nuclear
weapons,
drug
cartels!
Usual
menu
of
clichéd

denial.

Denial
of

in

when
Oh,
Inez.
It's
gonna
be
such
an
event!
-
I
only
wish
that...
It's
your
choice.
What
can
I
say?
Gil
is--
he's
smart,
-
He
talks
about
giving
that
all
up
and
moving
here!
Well,
that
frightens
me.
This
is,
of
course,
Rodin's
most
famous
statue.
A
cast
of
this
work
was
placed
next
to
his
tomb.
Rodin
wished
it
to
serve
as
his
headstone
and
epitaph.
-
Is
that
true?
if
I'm
not
mistaken.
In
1917,
I
believe.
-
Very
good,
sir.
Yeah.
So
much
of
Rodin's
work
was
influenced
by
his
wife,
Camille.
Yes,
she
was
an
influence,
though
-
Camille?
No.
-
Yes.
Rose
was
the
wife.
Yes,
he
did
marry
Rose,
-
in
the
last
year
their
lives.
Are
you
arguing
with
the
guide?
-
Yes,
I
am.
Yeah,
actually,
she's
right.
I
recently
read
a
two-volume
Rose
was
definitely
the
wife.
-
Yeah.
You
read
that?
Where
did
you...
because
I
mistakenly
thought,
like
you,
that
it
was,
yeah,
the
other
way
around.
So,
Dad
invited
you
guys
for
a
wine-tasting.
-
Oh,
it'll
be
so
French!
Paul
is
an
expert
on
French
wine.
-
You're
joking.
Really?
When
did
you
read
the
biography
on
Rodin?
Me?
Why
would
I
read
I
will
always
take
a
California
wine,
but,
Napa
Valley's
6,000
miles
away.
John,
old
boy,
how
are
you,
buddy?
Oh,
hey!
What're
you
doing
here?
Come
on.
I
can't
stand
that
guy.
Um...How
'bout
-
we
try
some
more
wine?
Now,
which
would
you
prefer
here?
Well,
I
think
we
need
to
be
scientific
and
just
start
drinking
them
all
again.
I
don't
know.
-
Why
are
your
cheeks
so
red?
-
They're
not
red.
Oh,
maybe
it's
because
of
the
These
pheromones

Stop!
-
Yeah.
but
kills
the
performance,
Have
you
tasted
the
'61?
It
is
divine!
-
Though,
Paul
picked
it
out.
I
didn't...
-
What's
happening?
What's
happening?
and
I
prefer
a
smoky
feeling
So,
Carol--
Carol
and
I
We
heard
of
a
great
place.
Interested?
-
No...
I
don't
want
to
be
a
killjoy,
but
I
need
to
get
a
little
fresh
air.
Oh,
come
on!
Come
on!
Although
if
you're
just
gonna
sit
there
and
obsess
over
where
the
fire
exits
are,
then...
Hey!
If
Gil
doesn't
want
to
go,
I
am
very
democratic,
and
Paul
is
a
marvelous
dancer.
If
it's
OK
with
you,
go
to
bed,
and
then
we'll
do
it
another
night.
OK.
Alright,
well
I
can
go,
though,
right?
-
You
want
to
go?
Yeah,
I
mean,
I'm
not
tired,
and
I'll
just
meet
you
back
at
the
hotel.
-
I'll
take
good
care
of
her.
I'll
get
a
cab.
Taxi!
-
OK,
but
you
should
take
a
cab.
-
No,
you'll
get
lost.
Is
he
a
good
writer?
-
Well,
he
won't
let
anybody.
Oh
look,
I
mean,
if
he
wants,
I'd
be
glad
to
-
That
would
be
great!
-
You
know,
I
think
that's
what
he
needs!
-
Well,
it
helps.
-
And
you
wouldn't
pull
any
punches?
-
Well,
I
certainly
won't
be
letting
I
do
that
about
you.
See,
but,
the
problem
is,
he
has
absolutely
no
respect
Really?
Oh,
excuse
me!
Parlez-vous...
-
Uh...Hôtel
Bristol?

Montez!
On
va
vous
laisser!
-
What?
-
I
didn't
hear
you.

What?
Come
on,
guy!
Guys,
I
think
you've
got
me
mixed
up.
Vous
allez
me
faire
fatigué.
Venir!
I
can't
understand
you.
What
is
this,
an
old
Peugeot?
Come
on,
have
a
drink.
Come
on!
-
Come
on,
buddy!
Come
on!
Give
me
your
hand.
OK.
-
Let's
go
in.
Paris,
the
city
of
lights.
OK,
now,
where
are
On

Yeah,

isn't
quite

champagne,
yeah...
Santé!
Santé!

drinking!
Yeah,

uh...Gil.
Yes?
-
Gil...Gil
Pender.
Hemingway.
Hemingway?
You
liked
my
book?
Liked?
I
loved!
Yes,
it
was
a
good
book,
and
that's
what
war
does
to
men.
And
there's
nothing
fine
and
noble
unless
you
die
gracefully,
and
then
it's
not
only
noble,
but
brave.
Did
you
read
my
story?
There
was
some
fine
writing
in
it,
-
I
might've
known
you'd
hate
it.

liked

story,

and
she
has

it's
writing.
You're
a
writer.
You
need
time
to
write.
She's
wasting
you

she's

Speak
up,
for
Christ's
sake!
I'm
asking
if
Actually,
I
don't
know
the
Fitzgeralds
that
well.
You're
a
writer.
You
make
observations.
Could
we
not
discuss
my
personal
life
in
public?
She's
jealous
of
his
gift,
-
You
like
his
work?
You
can
speak
for
it.
You
like
Mark
Twain?
I'm
going
to
find
Zelda.
I
don't
like
the
thought
May
I?
Yeah,
I'm
actually
a
huge
Mark
Twain
fan.
I
think
you
can
even
make
the
case
comes
from
Huckleberry
Finn.
-
You
box?
What're
you
writing?
-
A
novel.
It's
about
a
man
who
works
What
the
hell
is
a
nostalgia
shop?
A
place
where
they
sell
old
things.
Memorabilia.
and...
Does
that
sound
terrible?
No
subject
is
terrible
if
the
story
is
true.
If
the
prose
is
clean
and
honest,
No
good.
Can
I
ask
you
the
biggest
favor
in
the
world?
-
What
is
it?
-
Your
novel?
400
pages
long,
and
I'm
just
My
opinion
is
I
hate
it.
I
mean,
you
haven't
even
read
it.
If
it's
bad,
I'll
hate
it
and
if
it's
good,
I'll
be
envious
and
hate
it
all
the
more.
Yeah.
You
know,
it's
just...
I'm
having
a
hard
time,
you
know,
trusting
somebody
to
evaluate
it.
Writers
are
competitive.
I'm
not
gonna
be
competitive
with
you.
You're
too
self-effacing.
If
you're
a
writer,
But
you're
not,
as
long
as
I'm
around.
No,
I
don't.
Hey,
I'm
not
gonna
read
your
novel,
Yes?
I'll
bring
it
to
Gertrude
Stein's.
She's
the
only
one
I
trust
with
my
writing.
You'll
show
my
novel
to
Gertrude
Stein?
-
Give
it
to
me.
-
And
she
gets
back
from
Spain
tomorrow.
I'm
gonna
go
get
it.
I
can't
tell
you
how
excited
I
am!
My
heart
is
just
racing
right
now!
I'm
gonna
get
it,
and
I'll
be
back.
Whoa,
whoa,
Gil!
You
had
a
big
night.
Papa!
OK,
we
never
said
where
Good
thing
you
didn't
go
last
night.
but
I
had
fun.
What're
you
thinking
about?
If
I
was
to
tell
you
that
I
spent
last
night
with
Ernest
Hemingway
-
what
would
you
say?
Your
literary
idols?
Yeah,
but
if
I
wasn't
dreaming...
What
does
that
mean?
If
I
was
with
Hemingway,
and
Cole
Porter.
I'd
be
thinking
brain
tumor.
And
when
I
tell
you,
as
we've
come
to
know
her
through
You
know,
charming,
but
all
over
the
map.
You
know,
she
does
not
like
and
Scott
knows
Hemingway
is
right
about
her,
Come
on!
Get
up!
We
should
quit
the
idle
chatter,
You
know,
I'm
not
gonna...
I
think
I'm
gonna
stay
here
'cause
there's
a
little
polishing
I
wanna
do.
No.
You
can
do
that
later.
Come
look
at
these,
Inez.
Wouldn't
these
be
charming
in
a
Malibu
beach
house?
-
Combien,
monsieur?

-
Merci.

There
a
steal
at
$18,000.
$18,000
for
this?
Oh
wait.
It's
Euros,
so
it's
more.
-
So
that's
like
20.
$20,000.
I
know,
but
it's
very
hard
-
She's
right,
Gil.
and
we're
trying
to
keep
expenses
down,
Well,
you
get
what
you
pay
for.
-
Nice.
OK,
you
guys
want
to
walk
back?
Walk?
No,
it's
starting
to
rain.
Oh,
it'll
be
nice
walking
in
the
rain!
No,
there's
nothing
beautiful
No,
don't
forget.
Oh,
right.
Yes.
Great.
And
then,
also,
I
have
a
big
-
What?
No.
I
don't
like
surprises.
-
What
is
it?
This
is
our
last
chance.
Okay.
I
don't
understand.
But,
you
made
us
rush
through
dinner,
and
Dad
wasn't
finished
with
his
profiteroles.
Profiteroles?
You're
going
to
have
-
Where?
-
Why
are
you
carrying
that
manuscript
around?
your
jaw
is
gonna
drop.
OK.
You
know
I
wouldn't
hide
anything,
-
it's...
-
It's
just,
I
don't
understand!
-
Yeah.
and
you're
gonna
wonder
why
I
wasn't
-
This
is
very...
Well,
I
don't
know
what
you're
carrying
on
about,
I
am
tired
from
the
gym
and
a
massage,
-
Taxi!
-
Let's
just
wait
a
little
longer.
you
want
to
walk
the
streets
of
Paris,
that's
fine.
You
go
ahead.
Come
on,
just
10
more
minutes,
If
I'm
asleep
when
you
get
in,
What
am
I
doing
wrong?
Unless
she's
right,
OK,
you
left
the
wine-tasting,
a
little
drunk,
Lost,
you
walk
along...
I
mean,
it's
just
like
a
one-shot
deal.
The
clock
struck
midnight...
Hello!
Oh,
hi,
Mr.
Hemingway.
Here.
Let
me
just
jump
in.
The
assignment
was
to
take
the
hill.
5
if
you
counted
Vicente,
but
he
had
and
couldn't
fight
as
he
could
when
I
first
met
him.
And
he
was
young,
and
brave.
And
the
hill
was
soggy
from
days
of
rain,
and
there
were
many
German
soldiers
on
the
road.
And
the
idea
was
to
aim
for
the
first
group,
and
if
our
aim
was
true,
we
could
delay
them.
-
Were
you
scared?
Getting
killed?
You'll
never
write
well
-
Do
you?
maybe
my
greatest
fear,
actually.
Well,
that's
something
all
men
before
-
I
know.
I
know.
Actually,
my
fiancée
is
pretty
sexy.
And
when
you
make
love
to
her,
passion,
and
you,
for
at
least
that
moment,
No.
That
doesn't
happen.
I
believe
that
love
that
is
true
and
real
All
cowardice
comes
from
not
loving,
And
when
the
man
who
is
brave
and
true
like
some
rhino-hunters
I
know,
It
is
because
they
love
with
sufficient
until
it
returns,
as
it
does,
to
all
men.
And
then
you
must
make
really
good
love
again.
Think
about
it.
-
Alice.
How
the
hell
are
you?
Good?
Good.
Ah,
she's
here.

me.

you're

can

why

she's

more
like
a
still-life
than
a

Non.

ne

d'accord.
And
what's

book
of

-
Yeah,

you

I

I
moved
here

to

all
this.
Yes,
I
do.
Yes,

here

I
fell
in

with

asked
me,
With
Braque,
though,
there
was
another

Many.
And
now,
with

he's

it's

here.

Really?
-

I
didn't
fall
in

madly
with
your
book...

Really?
-
You
really

Because
I'm
still

of
tinkering...

Yeah,
let's
go

to

Let's
get

OK?
I'll

OK,

if
I'm

this
was
a

to
capture
a
young
French

named
Adriana,
from

if
my

history
serves
me,
who
came
to

to

I'm
pretty
sure
she
had
an

is
how
Pablo
met
her.
Of

what
you
don't
get
from
this
portrait
and
her

What
have
you
been

I'd

call

Hollywood,
and....
But
I
will
say
that
we
both
like
Indian
food.
you
know...the
pita
bread.
We
both
like
pita
bread.
I
should
go.
Pablo
will
be
missing
me.
-
Come
on.
I'll
walk
you
home.
Just
finish
your
drink.
-
No.
Come
on.
I'm
not
gonna...
but
thank
you
for
the
evening.
Monsieur?
C'est
un
dommage.
C'est
un
dommage.
We
met,
earlier
tonight...
At
the
party!
Dalí,
sí?
-
Yes...
-
I
remember!
Un
bouteille
de
vin
rouge!
It
can't
be...
So?
Un
autre
verre
pour
monsieur,
s'il
vous
plaît.
I
love
the
language!
The
French!
You
like
the
shape
of
the
rhinoceros?
The
rhinoceros?
Uh...
Haven't
really
thought
about
it.
I
paint
the
rhinoceros.
Sí.
Your
sad
eyes.
Your
big
lips,
melting
over
the
hot
sand,
with
one
tear.
Yes!
And
in
your
tear,
The
Christ's
face!
Yes,
in
the
rhinoceros.
Yeah.
I
mean,
I
probably
do
look
sad.
I'm
in...
a
very
perplexing
situation.
Diablo...Luis!
Oye,
Luis!
My
friends.
This...
Señor
Buñuel.
-
Buñuel?
-
Man
Ray?
My
Gosh!
This
is
Pen-der.
Pen-der.
Pender!
-
Yes.
And
I
am
Dalí!
You
have
to
remember.
Pender
is
in
a
perplexing
situation.
It
sounds
so
crazy
to
say.
You
guys
are
going
to
think
I'm
drunk,
but
I
have
to
tell
someone.
I'm...
from
a...
a
different
time.
Another
era.
The
future.
OK?
I
come...
from
the
2000th
millenium
to
here.
I
get
in
a
car,
and
I
slide
through
time.
Exactly
correct.
You
inhabit
two
worlds.
-
So
far,
I
see
nothing
strange.
Yeah,
you're
surrealists!
But
I'm
a
normal
guy.
I'm
engaged
to
marry
a
woman
I
love.
At
least,
I
think
I
love
her.
Christ!
I
better
love
her!
The
rhinoceros
makes
love
by
mounting
the
female.
But...
is
there
a
difference
in
the
beauty
between
two
rhinoceroses?
There
is
another
woman?
Adriana.
Yes,
and
I'm...
very
drawn
to
her.
I
find
her
extremely
alluring.
The
problem
is
that
other
men,
great
artists
-
geniuses
-
and
she
finds
them.
A
man
in
love
with
a
woman
I
see
a
photograph.
I
see
a
film.
I
see
an
insurmountable
problem.
I
see...
...a
rhinoceros.
Did
you
get
any
work
done
last
night?
Yeah...I
just....
book
is
too
realistic.
That
I'm
missing
some
chances
go
crazy,
and
not
be
so
-
Why
do
you
always
look
so
good
in
the
morning?
-
We
have
to
get
dressed!
Come
here!
I've
been
working
like
a
demon.
I
can't
resist
you
any
more.
Paul
said
we
have
to
go
to
the
countryside.
You
know?
He
said
he's
taking
us
But,
I
mean,
if
you
don't
want
to
go,
I'm
not
missing
it
because
of
you.
Hello!
Bonjour!
-
Hello!
I
have
a
quick
question
for
you
about
Rodin.
OK,
now,
I
understand
and
he
also
loved
his
mistress.
-
Yes.
to
love
two
women
at
once?
Well,
he
loved
them
both,
You
know...
That's
very...
You
guys
are
way...
more
evolved
in
that
department
Do
you
remember
me?
-
was
in
the
group
that...
The
group
with
the
pedantic
gentleman.
Pedantic?
Yes.
Here
is
...
his
photo.
I
want
to
know
where
What
is
your
suspicion?
Hm?
He's
engaged
to
my
daughter.
To
marry.
I
want
to
make
sure
Naturally,
discretion
is
paramount.
Well,
you've
come
to
the
Monsieur
Tisserant
will
personally
and
report
about
his
whereabouts
at
night.
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Thank
you
for
stopping.

OK.
Sorry.
Sorry.

come
from,

their
lives
-
Hello?
Ms.
Stein?
I'll
get
to
your
book
in
a
moment.
We're
just
in
the
middle
Oh,
OK.
Should
I
come
back?
No,
it's
no
secret.
Adriana
has
left
Pablo,
Sabía
que
tenía

con
este
fanfarrón!
Ya
hemos
hablado
de
todo
esto!
Estoy
segura
de
que
ella
regresará

Muy
devoto.
Oh,

took
her
hunting
kudu,
The
sound
of
hyenas

your
ears

night

Mount
Kilimanjaro
is

Paris.
-
What
are
you
saying,
that
he
took
her
to
Mount
Kilimanjaro?
it's
very
unusual,
indeed.
I
mean,
in
a
way,
it's
almost
like
science
fiction.
We
all
fear
death,

is

to
despair,

to

an
antidote

Tell
Gil
to
bring
his
suit,
'cause
we're
I
forgot
to
tell
you,
actually.
Why
not?
Because,
he
writes.
He
rewrites
the
rewrites,

know?
He
says,
"Picasso

left
his

don't

did

find

In
the
bathroom?
What
the
hell
were
they
I
don't

you
dropped
them,
and

were

away,

placed

know,
I
was
wondering
if
-
What
have
we
got
here?
OK,
now,
I've
brought
a
rewrite
over
and
if
you
could
just
tell
me
if
I'm
-
Leave
it
with
me.
and
have
you
heard
from
Hemingway?
Oh,
they've
been
back
for
days,
now.
The
trip
didn't
work
out.
It's
over.
With
Picasso,
too.
She's
at
Deyrolle,
by
herself.

herself?
Oh,
one
of
those
crazy

doing
it
up
there.

be
glad
to
see
you.
Eh
bien,
mes
chers
amies,
je
propose
de
porter
un
toast...
Oh.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
came
to
find
you.
-
You
did?
let's
just
say,
as
a
writer,
picking
up
on
vibrations
from
people-
I
sense
that
there
are
that
you
have
for
me.
Aren't
you
gonna
get
married?
Well,
everything's
a
little
I
don't
know
what
is
gonna
happen.
Is
there
some
place
that
we
-
Sure.
Oh,
Mr.
Buñuel!
I
had
a
nice
idea
-
Yes?
very
formal
dinner
party.
At
the
end
of
dinner,
Why
not?
They
just
can't
seem
to
exit
the
door.
-
B...But
why?
when
they're
forced
to
stay
together,
quickly
fades
away,
who
they
really
are:

animals.
But
I
don't
get
it.
Why
don't
they
just
All
I'm
saying
is
just
think
about.
Maybe
when
you're
shaving
one
day,
I
don't
understand.
What
are
you
doing?
I
don't
know!
I
did
feel,
while
I
was
doing
it,
like
I
was
immortal.
But
you
look
so
sad.
Because
life
is
too
mysterious.
This
is
the
time
we
live
in.
Everything
moves
so
fast.
Life
is
noisy
and
complicated.
I've
always
been
a
logical
person.
I
never
acted
too
crazy.
I
didn't
stay
here.
I
didn't
take
a
real
shot
at
being
a
writer.
I'd
just,
kind
of,
be
a
hired
Hollywood
hand.
Don't
laugh.
I
just
want
to...
I
feel
like
I
just
want
to
let
it
go.
-
Here.
Oh!
This
is...
Go
on.
Here,
put
in
on.
They're
so
beautiful!
Look!
Monsieur,
Mademoiselle,
on
y
va!
-
Qui
est
vous?

-
Allez!
Oh,
mon
Dieu,
It's
unbelievable!
Here
it
is:
La
Belle
Époque!
Wow!
I
don't
know
It's
like,
I've
got
to
write
a
note
Bon
soir!
Bon
soir!
Bienvenue.
Thank
you.
Oh,
mon
Dieu!
Quelle
robe
magnifique!
Tellement
avant-garde!
S'il
vous
plaît,
prenez
un
boire
du
champagne.
C'est
la
fête!
Champagne.
Isn't
it
amazing?
The
first
time
we
met,
and
the
Belle
Époque,
and
here
we
are!
I
don't
know
why,
I
don't
know,
like
I
can't...
believe
my
luck.
Well,
I
can.
I
know
exactly
where
I
want
to
go
next.
You
lead
the
way.
Look!
Oh,
my
God!
Pablo
admires
him
so
much!
-
I
have
to
say
hello.
-
Come
with
me!
I'm
nervous.
But,
we
know
he's
a
lonely
man.
-
I'm
sure
he
would
love
some
company.
Monsieur
Lautrec?
-
Oui?

-
Merci,
Madame.

Je
serais
enchantée.

a
minute?

Enchanté..
Wow,
it
didn't
take
Let's
never
go
back
to
the
'20s!
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
It's
the
start
of
La
Belle
Époque!
It's
the
greatest,
most
Yeah,
but
about
the
'20s,
and
the
Fitzgeralds,
I
mean,
I
love
those
guys.
But
it's
the
present.
Dull?
It's
not
my
present.
I'm
from
2010.
What
do
you
mean?
I
dropped
in
on
you
the
same
way
You
did?
I
was
trying
to
escape
my
present
to
a
golden
age.
Surely
you
don't
think
Well,
yeah.
To
me
they
are.
But
I'm
from
the
'20s,
and
I'm
And
look
at
these
guys.
I
mean,
to
them,
You
know,
they're
trade
Belle
Époque
Titian
and
Michelango.
And
those
guys
probably
imagined
life
was
a
lot
better
You
see,
I'm
having
an
insight
right
now.
it
explains
the
anxiety
in
my
dream
that
I
had.
-
What
dream?
it
was
like
a
nightmare,
And
then
I
went
to
the
dentist,
You
see
what
I'm
saying?
These
people
don't
have
any
antibiotics.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Adriana,
if
you
stay
here,
then,
pretty
soon,
you'll
start
you
know,
was
really
the
golden
time.
That's
what
the
present
is.
That
it's
a
little
unsatisfying,
That's
the
problem
with
writers.
You
are
so
full
of
words.
But
I
am
more
emotional,
and
I'm
going
stay,
and
live
in
Paris'
most
glorious
time.
You
made
a
choice
to
leave
Yeah,
I
did
regret
it.
but
at
least
it
was
a
choice.
I
mean,
it
was
a
real
choice.
I
don't
know,
crazy.
If
I
ever
want
to
write
you
know,
get
rid
of
my
happier
in
the
past,
So...
Goodbye,
Gil?
Goodbye.
Pender,
I
read
your
rewrite,
You
understood
me
clearly.
If
the
rest
of
the
book
-
you'll
have
something
of
value.
I
really
did
listen
to
you,
You
know,
it
seems
like
I'm
I
mean,
it
just
means
-
Hemingway
read
the
chapters,
too,
and
he
thinks...
...he
thinks
it's
going
to
be
a
fine
book.
but
he
did
have
one
plot
suggestion.
What's
the
suggestion?
Well,
he
doesn't
quite
believe
doesn't
see
that
his
fiancée
is
-
With?
That's
called
denial.
Thank
you.
You're
crazy!
Paul
and
I?
Where
did
you
get
such
an
insane
notion?
Where?
From
Ernest
Hemingway.
He
figured
it
out,
and,
guess
what,
Gil,
your
brain
tumor's
acting
up
again.
-
No.
No!
or
Fitzgerald,
or
Gertrude
Stein,
Yeah,
except
that
they've
been
dead
for
years!
No,
no.
The
past
is
not
dead.
Actually,
it's
not
even
past.
Faulkner.
And
he
was
right.
I
ran
into
him
at
a
dinner
party.
-
You're
a
raving
lunatic!
-
Yes,
you
are.
I'm
jealous,
It's
cognitive
dissonance.
-
Scott
Fitzgerald
talked
about
it.
Inez,
you
can
fool
me,
-
I
know.
OK.
Yes!
I
did.
I
was
with
Paul
for
a
few
nights,
because
he's
romantic,
and
you
were
always
working,
and
maybe
it's
get
over
it,
Gil.
You
just
put
this
in
perspective
I'm
not...I'm
not
going
back.
-
I'm
sorry.
What?
you
know,
your
romantic
fling;
Inez,
you
and
I,
it's
obvious
we're
not...
I
don't
think
we're
right
for
each
other.
What?
What
are
you
saying?
What
are
you
even
talking
about?
-
You
ready
to
go
swimming?
We're
breaking
up.
-
What?
-
I
knew
it.
I
told
you.
No,
no,
I'm
going
to
stay
in
Paris,
but
just
because
we're...
If
I'm
unhappy,
I'll
move
back.
W...W...With
who?...
-
No
one,
I...
I
mean,
Mom's
right
about
you.
You
have
this
part
missing.
Yeah,
I
said
that
first.
Anyone
whose
protagonist
selling
old
cap
pistols
-
Honestly...
a
martyr,
but
I
think
-
I
really
do.
-
I
can't
believe
you're
moving.
Walk
the
streets.
Gush
over
the
Goodbye,
Inez.
-
Say
hi
to
Trotsky.
-
Unbelievable!
a
private
detective
follow
him.
-
You
did?
He
saw
him
get
into
a
car
and
he
followed
him
very
closely.
-
And
what
happened?
The
detective
agency
says
À
qui
dois-je
l'honneur?
Je...Je
suis
perdu.
J'ai
detournée
la
mauvaise
endroit.
Gardes!
Gardes!
Lui
coupe
la
tête!
Lui
coupe
la
tête!
-
Hey!
Hi!
Wow!
What...
Good
to
see
you.
What
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
returning
from
dinner
with
friends.
-
Oh.
OK.
And
you?
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
was
just
out
for
a
walk.
Yeah,
I'm
actually...I
decided.
-
Really?
Wow.
I'm
sure
you
will
love
it.
-
Yeah.
You
think
so?
You
know,
I
thought
about
-
Really?
my
boss
got
a
whole
That
made
you
think
about
me?
I
like
to
be
thought
of
that
way.
You're
on
your
way
home
right
now?
Yes.
Can
I
walk
with
you,
Oh,
OK,
now
it's
starting
to
rain.
No,
but
that's
OK.
-
Really?
Actually,
Paris
is
the
most
beautiful
in
the
rain.
I
feel
that's
what
I
couldn't
agree
more
with
you.
Yes,
it
is
more
beautiful.
By
the
way,
my
name
is
Gabrielle.
-
Gil.
That's
a
pretty
name.
