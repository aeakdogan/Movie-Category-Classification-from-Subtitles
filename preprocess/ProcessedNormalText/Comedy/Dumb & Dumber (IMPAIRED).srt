You

my
briefcase?
Hey,
I
have
it
You
want
to
jump
on
the

cleaning
my
teeth.
I'm
gargling.
Just
give
me
a
minute,
Mary.
Harry,
I'm
sorry,
but
something
and
I've
got
It's-it's
sort
of
an
emergency.
-
But,
Mary--
I
promise
we'll
do
this
Race
you
to
the
top.
-
Come
here.
Yeah!
Ha

I
won!
Look
familiar?
I
don't
believe
it.
Of
course,
I
have
it.
When
Lloyd
Christmas
he
makes
sure
she
gets
-
That's
my
whole
philosophy.
You
mean
to
say
just
for
me?
Uh...
I
didn't
really
And
I
know
how
to

so
sweet,
Lloyd.

crazy
about
you.
I've
never
felt
this
way
Listen
to
me.
I
feel
like
a
schoolboy
to
make
sweet
Oh,
I
thought
I
heard
Mary,
l-l--
I
desperately
want
to
make
love
-
Maybe
I
should
be
going.

No,
l--
that's
not
Um...
what
l
God.
I-I
like
you,
Mary.
I
like
you
a
lot.
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
and
I
want
you
to
give
me
What
do
you
think
of
a
guy
like
you
ending
up
together?
Well,
Lloyd,
We
really
don't--
Hit
me
with
it!
I
came
a
long
way
Just--
the
least
you
can
do
What
are
my
chances?
Not
good.
You
mean
not
good,
I'd
say

Look,
we've
got
to

I
got
a
confession
Oh,

Can
I
have
I
guess
we
both
learned

about
each
other
today,
didn't

guess
not.

beautiful
girl
then
maybe
our
friendship
Maybe
we
