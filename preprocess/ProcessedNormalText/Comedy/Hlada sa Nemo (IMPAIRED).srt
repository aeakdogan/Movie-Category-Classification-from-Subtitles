Just
think,

we're
going
to
be
parents.
What
if
they
don't
like
me?
-
Marlin.
There's

NEMO:
First
day
of
school!
Wake
up,

up!
I
don't
want
to
go
to
school...
Not
you,
Dad,

OK.
Huh?
It's
time
for
school,
All
right,
I'm

Nemo,
don't
move.
You'll
never
get
out
I'll
do
it.
Unh!

-
You
feel
a
break?
Sometimes
you
can't
tell
-
Are
you
woozy?
-
How
many
stripes
do
I
have?
-
Answer
the
stripe
question.
No!
See?
I
have
one,
two,
three...
You're
OK.

Lucky.

Are
you
sure
you
want
to
go
There's
no
problem
if
you
don't.
Come
on,
Dad,
-
Forgot
to
brush.
Do
you
want
this
anemone
-
Yes.
-
OK,
I'm
done.

Where?
-
Where?
Ha
ha!
Right
there.

All
right,
we're
excited.
All
right,
we're
excited.
The
first
day
of
school.
We're
ready
to
learn
What's
the
one
thing
we
have
-
It's
not
safe.
First,
we
check
to
see
We
go
out...
and
back
in.
And
then
we
go
out...
And
then
one
more
time...
And
sometimes,
if
you
want
-
Dad...
Maybe
while
I'm
at
school,
-
I
highly
doubt
that.
No,
and
I
don't
plan
to.
-
How
old
are
sea
turtles?
Sandy
Plankton
he
says
that
sea
turtles
live
If
I
ever
meet
a
sea
turtle,
After
I'm
done
Whoa!
Hold

He
doesn't
walk
up,
Actually,
He's
in
one
place,
Well,

There
was
a
mollusk
None

Sheldon!
Get
out

Whoa!
Ooh,

too?
I
would
feel
better
if



That's
where
I
would
play.

-
What's
wrong
with
his
fin?
Ow!
Hey,
what'd
I
do?
Be
nice.
He
was
born
with
it.
-
Dad...
It's
actually
shorter
but
you
can't
really
tell.
Especially
when
I'm
H-2-O
intolerant.

Who's
that?
DORY:
Are
you
my
conscience?
MARLIN:
Yeah,
yeah.
We
haven't
spoken
for
a
while.
-
Can't
complain.
Now,
Dory,
Do

see
anything?
I

a...
I
see
a
light.

A
light?

Hey,
conscience,

What
is
it?
It's
so
pretty.
I'm
feeling...
happy...

is
a
big
deal
for
me.
I
want
to
touch
it.

Enough
with
the
Sharkbait.
Ooh...
ba-ba-do.
Sharkbait's
-
Agreed.
Darla's
coming
in
five
days.
So,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
I'll
tell
you
we're
gonna
get
him
-
We'll
help
him
escape.
We're
all
gonna
escape.
Gill,
please.
Sorry,
Why
should
this
-
Because
we've
got
him.
-
You
see
that
filter?
You're
the
only
one
who
can

need
you
to
take

soon,
the

when
he
does,
he'll
take

put
us
in
then
we'll
roll
ourselves
out
the
window,
into
the
bushes,
and
into
the
harbor!
It's
foolproof.
-
Aye!
I
think
you're
nuts.

No
offense,
kid,
He's
fine.
He
can
do
this.
So,
Sharkbait,
Let's
do
it.
DORY:
I'm
going
to
P.
Sherman,
Where
are
you
going?
I'm
going

you
I'll
tell
you
again.

OK,
all
right.

Here's
the
thing.
I
think
it's
best
by
myself.
OK.

You
know,
alone.
Without...
without...
But
I
don't
-
Huh?
I
don't
want
to
hurt
-
You
want
me
to
leave?
I
just
can't
afford

you're
one
of
those
fish
Sometimes
it's
a
good
thing.
There's
a
whole
group
of
fish.
You
mean
you
don't
like
me?
No,
of
course
I
like
you.
It's
because
I
like
you
It's
a
complicated
emotion.

Ohh!
Hey,
you!
Um...
I
don't

no.
Do
you

Are

looking
at
this
thing?
It's
got
death
I

Look!
Something
shiny!

Come

we'll
follow
it!
Boy,
it
sure
is
clear
up
here.
Exactly.
And
look
at
that...
We
should
be
there
in
no
time.
Hey,
little
guy.
You
wanted
to
go
I
shall
call
him
Squishy,
And
he
shall
be
my
Squishy.
Come
here,
little
Squishy.


Ow!
-
That's
a
jellyfish!
Shoo,
shoo!
Get
away!
-
Let
me
see
that.
I
won't
touch
it.
Hey!
How
come

Let's
be
thankful
this
time

The
tops
don't
sting
you!
Dory,
listen
to
me.

A
game?

I
love
games!
Pick
me!
Whoever
can
hop
the
fastest

do
this.
Yeah,

I
don't
I
don't
think
so!
Ha
ha
ha
ha!
Whoa!
Give
it
up,
old
man.
You
can't
fight

The
question
is,
Dory,

Hungry?
'Cause
you're
about
Duck

The
clownfish

He's
not
looking
for
me.
He's
scared
of
the
ocean.
Peach,
any
movement?
He's
had
four
cups
of
coffee.
Keep

Golly,
that's
amazing.
And
then
dives

down
It's
wicked
dark
down
there.
You
can't

And
the
only
thing

...Oh,
we'll
meet,
...Beyond
the
shore...
...We'll
kiss
...Happy
we
will
be
...And
never
again...
...I'll
go

...No
more
sailin'...
...So
long,
...No
more
sailin'...
...Good-bye,
farewell,
...No
more
sailin'...
...So
long...
...Sailin'...
...No
more
sailin'...
...No
more...
...Farewell...
...Auf
wiedersehen...
...Adieu
to
you
and
you...
...No
more
sailin'...
...No
more...
...Ohh,
no
more
sailin'...
...No
more,
no
more...
...No
more
sailin'...
...No
more...
...One
more
time...
...No
more
sailin'...
