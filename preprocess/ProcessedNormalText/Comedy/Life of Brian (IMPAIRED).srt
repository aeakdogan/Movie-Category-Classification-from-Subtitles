What?
Well,
what
are
you
doing
creeping
around
That
doesn't
sound
-
We
are
astrologers.
Is
this
some
kind
of
joke?
We
wish
to
praise
the
infant.
We
must
pay
homage
to
him.
Homage?
You're
drunk!
Out

Hmm?

Well,

He
is
the
Son
of
God,
King
of
the
Jews!

That's
Capricorn,
is
it?
Oh,
I
was
gonna
say,
otherwise
-
By
what
name
are
you
calling
him?

We
worship
you,
O
Praise
unto
you,
Brian,
and

You

of
this,

Oh,

Brian.
Don't
pick
your

I
wasn't
picking
my

You
was

I
wasn't.
Do

Don't

Well,

Don't

swear
at
my

I
was
only
asking
her
to
shut
up
so
-
Don't
you
call
my
husband
"Big
Nose.
"
Could
you
be
quiet,
please?
I
was
too
busy
I
think
it
was,
What's
so
special
Well,
obviously,
it's
not
meant
It
refers
to
any
manufacturers
See,
if
you
hadn't
been
going
on,
Hey!
Say
that
once
more,
Better

I
wasn't
gonna
pick
my

Hear
that?
"Blessed

Well,
apparently
-
Did
anyone
catch
his
name?
I'll
thump
him
-
Oh,
shut
up,
Big
Nose.
-
I
really
will
slug
you
so
hard...
"Blessed
are
the
meek"!
I'm
glad
they're
getting
something,
Listen,
I'm
only
telling
the
truth.
Hey,

That's
disgusting.
It's
the

Oh,
I
hate
wearing
these
beards.
Why
aren't

allowed
It's

Go
to
the

Always

isn't
there?
Look,
I
don't
think
it
ought
to

Making
it

Jehovah!
Jehovah!
Jehovah!
I'm
warning
you,
if
you
say
Right.
Come

Was
it
you?
-
Right...

Stop!
Will
you
stop
that?
Stop
it!
Now,
look!
until
I
blow
this
whistle.
Do
you
understand?
Even...
and
I
want

-
Have
I
got
a
big
nose,
Mum?

I
wasn't!
"Will
the

like
this?
Is
it
too

Half
a

Come
on,
Big
Nose,
let's
haggle.
You
open
at
one
shekel.
-
No.
-
Go

years
behind
the

-
Well,
what
happened?
-
Cured?
-
Well,
who
cured
you?
I
was
hopping
along,
All
of
a
sudden,
One
minute,
next
minute,
"You're
cured,
mate.
"
Well,
why
don't
you
go
and
tell
him
I
could
do
that,
sir.
I
was
gonna
ask
him
if
he'd
make
me
a
bit
You
know,
something

but
not
Brian!
Come
and
clean
-
There
you
are.
Half
a

There's
no

That's
just

-
Oh!
Oh,
uh,
hello,
officer.
I'll
be
with
you
in
a
few
-
What's
he
doing
here?
-
Bloody
Romans!
If
it
wasn't
for
him,
-
And
don't
you
forget
it.
-
Well,
that's
not
entirely
true.
-
Well,
you
know
you
were
asking
me
about
your...
Yes.
Well,
there's
a
reason
What
is
it?
Well,
I
suppose
I
should've
-
What?
your
father
-
Well,
I
never
thought
he
was.
He
was
a
Roman,
Brian.
He
was
a
centurion
-
You
mean
you
were
raped?
-
Who
was
it?
Promised
me
I
was
to
be
taken
to
Rome,
slaves,
asses'
milk,
as
much
gold
as
I
could
eat.
Then
he,
having
his
way
-
Vroom,
like
a
rat
out
of
an
aqueduct!
Yeah,
so
next
time
you
go
on
don't
forget
I'm
not
a
Roman,
Mum!
I'm
a

a
Yid,
I'm

that

Furthermore,

From

on,
I
want
you
all

Well,
why
do
you

I
want
to

You
want

It's
every

But
you
can't

I'm
not
oppressing
you.

Why
don't
you

Yeah,

Well,
don't
blame

All
right.

Make

Are
you
the
Judean
People's
Front?
-
What?

-
Judean
People's
Front!
-
Can
I
join
your
group?
I
didn't
want
to
sell

I
hate
the
Romans
as
much
as
anybody!

Are
you
sure?
Listen,
if
you
wanted
you'd
have
to
really

I
do.
A
lot.
Right.
You're
in.
Listen.
The
only
people
are
the
fuckin'

Yeah!
-
And
the
Judean
Popular
People's
Front.
-
And
the
People's
Front
of
Judea.
-
What?
We're
the
People's
Front
of
Judea!
Oh.
I
thought
we
were
People's
Front!
-
What
happened
to
the
Popular
Front?



Oh!
I
think
I'm
about
-


Brother!
Ha-ha!
Brian.
Brian
Cohen.
We
may
have
a
little
job
What's
this,
then?
"People
called
Romanes,
I-
It
says
"Romans,
go
home.
"
No,
it
doesn't.
-
Come
on!
-
Goes
like?
-
Vocative
plural
of
"annus"
is?
"Romani.
"
-
"Eunt"?
What
is
"eunt"?
Conjugate
the
verb
"to
go.
"
"Ire,
eo,
is,
it,
So
"eunt"
is?
Third
person
plural,
But
"Romans,
go
home"
is
-
The
imperative.
Um,
oh,
oh,
"i.
"
-
How
many
Romans?
-
"Ite.
"
-

"Go
home.
"
This
is
motion
Dative!

Accusative,
accusative!
-
"Domum,"
sir.
"Ad
domum.
"
-
Locative,
sir.
-
"Domum.
"
-

-
Understand?
Now,
write
it
out
100
times.
Yes,
sir.
Thank
you,
sir.
Hail
Caesar.
If
it's
not
done
Oh,
thank
you,
sir.
Thank
you.


Right.
Now,
Hey,
bloody
Romans!
We're
gettin'
in
through
the
up
through
into
the
main
and
Pilate's
wife's
bedroom
is
here.
Having
grabbed
his
wife,
we
inform
and
forthwith
issue
our
demands.
-
Any
questions?
We're
giving
Pilate
the
entire
apparatus
of
and
if
he
doesn't
agree
-
Cut
her
head
off?
Send
them
back
And,
of
course,
we
point
out
full
responsibility
and
that
we
shall
not
submit

They
bled
us
white,
the
bastards.
And
not
just
from
us.
From
our
fathers
-
And
from
our
fathers'
fathers'
fathers.
-
And
from
our
fathers'
fathers'
fathers'
fathers.
And
what
have
they
ever
-
The
aqueduct.
The
aqueduct.
Oh,
yeah,
yeah.
And
the
sanitation.
Oh,
yeah,
the
sanitation,
Reg.
Yeah,
I'll
grant
you,
the
aqueduct
and
-
And
the
roads.
I
mean,
the
roads
go
But
apart
from
the
sanitation,
-
Irrigation.
-
Education.
-
And
the
wine.
Yeah,
that's
something
we'd
really
miss,
-
Public
baths.
Yeah,
they
certainly
keep
order.
They're

All
right,
but
apart
from
education,
wine,
public
order,
the
fresh
water
system
what
have
the
Romans
-
Brought
peace.


I'm
a
poor
man.
My
legs
are
old
and
bent.
It's
all
right,
Matthias.
It's
all
clear.
Well,
where's
Reg?
Oh,
Reg.
Reg,
Judith.
-
What
went
wrong?
-
Did
he
finish
the
slogan?
in
letters
ten
foot
high,
Oh,
great.
Great.
We...
We
need
doers
but
before
you
join
us,
know
this:
There
is
not
one
of
us
who
to
rid
this
country
of
-

Uh,
well,
one.
But
otherwise,
we're
solid.
Yes.
From
now
on
you
shall
be
called
Tell
him
about
the
raid
Right.
Now,
this
is
the
palace
Our
commando
unit
will
approach
and
make
our
way
If
questioned,
we
are
sewage
workers
Reg,
our
glorious
leader
will
be

though
he
himself
will
not
be
taking
as
he
has
a
bad
back.
-
Aren't
you
going
to
come
with
us?
Oh,
yes,
solidarity,
Reg.

Once
in
the
sewer,
There
is
a
Roman
feast
later
And
don't
wear
Turning
left
here,
we
enter
the
and
from
there
proceed
This
has
just
been
retiled.
So,
We
will

be
directly
beneath
This
is
the
moment
for
Habbakuk
Shhh.
Shhh.
Campaign
for
Free
Galilee.
Oh,
uh,
People's
Front
-
Oh.
We're
gonna
kidnap
Pilate's
wife,
-
So
are
we.
That's
our
plan.
-
We
were
here
first.
-
We
thought
of
it
first.
Yes,
a
couple
of
years
ago.
Come
on.
You
got
all
your
demands
-
Of
course
we
have.
-
Well,
I'm
not
telling
you.
That's
not
the
point.
-
Did
not!
You
bastards,
we've
been
Well,
tough
pity
for
you,
Brothers,
we
should
-

Surely,
we
should
be
united

No,
no,
the
Romans!
Oh,
yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
he's
right.
-
Right.
Where
were
we?


Brothers!





Who's
that?
You
lucky,
lucky
bastard.
-
What?
-
What
do
you
mean?
Slipped
him
a
few
shekels?
Oh,
what
wouldn't
I
give
I
sometimes
hang
awake
at
night
Well,
it's
not
exactly
friendly.
Manacles?
My
idea
of
heaven
is
to
be
just
for
a
few
hours.
They
must
think
the
sun
shines
Oh,
lay
off
me!
You've
had
a
hard
time?
They
only
hung
me
the
right
way
All
right,
all
right.
They
must
think
-
What
will
they
do
to
me?
-
Crucifixion?
Get
away
with
crucifixion?
-
Best
thing
the
Romans
ever
did
for
us.
Oh,
yeah,
if
we
didn't
have
crucifixion,
-
Guard!
-
Guard!
What
do
you
want?
-
I
want
you
to
move
me
to
another
cell.
-
Aah!
-
Shut
up,
you!

Now
take
my
case.
Every
night,
they
take
me
down
for
which
I
regard
as
very
fair
And
if
nothing
else,
it's
and
it's
taught
me
that
you'll
unless
you're
prepared
to
do
Oh,
shut
up!
-
Here.
-
Me?
Pilate?
What's
he
want
I
think
he
wants
to
know
which
way
up

-
Shut
up!
Terrific
race,
the
Romans.


-
Hail
Caesar.
-
Only
one
survivor,
sir.

What's
that?
Oh.

Now,

No,

Aah!

What?
Oh,
yes,
"thwow"
him
-
Aah!
I'm
not

A

Aah!
So,

He
was
a

Really?

Centurion,

you
have
Well,
no,

Well,
you
sound
very
sure.
Well,
no,

Like,
uh,
"Sillius
Soddus"

What's
funny
Well,
it's
a
joke
name,
sir.
I
have
a
very
great

Silence!
You
will
find
yourself
with
"wotten"
behavior
like
that.
Can
I
go
now,
sir?
Wait
till
Biggus
Dickus
-

-
Oh,
sir,
he...
Yes,
sir.

I
will
not
have
my
friends
Anyone
else
feel
like
when
I
mention
my
"fwiend,"
-
Biggus...
-
Dickus?
What
about
you?
when
I
say
the
name...
Biggus...
Dickus?


He
has
a
wife,
you
know?
You
know
what
she's
called?
She's
called
"Incontinentia.
"
-
"Incontinentia
Buttocks.
"
Shut
up!
I've
had
enough
of
this
-

Seize
him!
Seize
him!
Hmm?
Hmm.






Oh,
you
lucky
bastard.
And
the
bezan
And
the
eyes
thereof
red
with
And
the
whore
of
Babylon...
shall
ride
forth
And
throughout
the
lands
The
demon
shall
bear
Nine-bladed...
not
two
which
he
will
wield
on
all
wretched
And
the
whoring
shall
be
There
shall
in
that
time
um,
and
there
shall
be
a
great
confusion
And
nobody
will
really
know
those
little
things...
with
the
sort
of
raffia
work
At
this
time,
a
friend
and
the
young
shall
not
know
the
things
possessed
that
their
fathers
put
there
Yea,
it
is
written
in
that
time...
How
much,
quick?
-
Oh,
uh,
20
shekels.
-
What?
-
Wait
a
minute.
-
We're
supposed
to
haggle.
-
What
do
you
mean,
no?
-
Well,
give
it
back,
then.
-
Burt,
this
bloke
won't
haggle.
All
right.
-
I
want
20
for
that.
-
Are
you
telling
me
that's
not
worth
20
shekels?
-
Feel
the
quality.
That's
none
of
your
goat.
-
No,
no,
no.
Do
it
properly.
-
Haggle
properly.
This
isn't
worth
19.
Oh,
dear,
oh,
dear.
-
All
right,
I'll
give
you
ten.
Ten?
Are
you
Me
with
a
poor,
dying
-
All
right,
I'll
give
you
11.
Did
I
hear
you
right?
Eleven?
-
Seventeen?
-
Eighteen.
-
All
right,
I'll
give
you
14.
-
That's
what
you
told
me
to
say!
Oh,
tell
me
-
Offer
me
14.
-
He's
offering
me
14
for
this!
Seventeen.
My
last
word.
I
won't
take
-
Sixteen.
Nice
to
do
business
with
you.
-
I'll
throw
you
in
this
as
well.
-
Burt.
-
Now,
where's
the
16
you
owe
me?
-
Right.
That's
four
I
owe
you,
then.
-
I've
got
it
here
somewhere.
Four?
For
this
gourd?
Look
at
it!
It's
worth
ten
-
You
gave
it
to
me
for
nothing.
All
right,
all
right.
No,
no,
no,
no.
You're
supposed
to
argue.
Oh,
well.
-
Daniel.
-
Job.
-
Joshua.
-
Judges.
-
And
Brian.
I
now
propose
that
all
seven
be
now
entered
in
the
minutes
-
I
second
that,
Reg.
Siblings,
let
us
not
One
total
catastrophe
like
this...
is
just
the
beginning!
Their
glorious
deaths
Look
out!
Hello?
Matthias?
-
Reg?
Reg,
it's
me,
Brian.
Get
off!
-
Stan!
-
Yeah,
piss
off.

Oh,
shit!
Coming.


Yea,
verily
at
that
time
a
man
shall
strike
his
donkey

My
eyes
are
dim.
-
Are
you
Matthias?
We
have
reason
to
believe
a
member
of
the
terrorist
organization,
Me?
No.
I
have
no
time
My
legs
are
grey.
My
eyes
are
old
and
bent.
Quiet!
Guards,
search
the
house.

You
know
the
penalty
for
harboring
-
No.
Oh.
-
Nasty,
eh?
What
do
you
mean,
Well,
you
could
be
stabbed.
Stabbed?
Takes
a
second.
It's
a
slow,
horrible
death.
Well,
at
least
it
gets
you
You're
weird.

No,
sir.
Well,
don't
worry.
-
Big
Nose.
Whew,
that
was
lucky.
I'm
sorry,
Reg.
Oh,
it's
all
right.
He's
sorry
he
led
the
Fifth
Legion
Well,
that's
all
right,
Have
a
scone.
You
stupid,
birdbrained,


-

My
ears
are
grizzled.
Yes?
There's
one
place
-
I'm
just
a
poor
old
man.
My
nose
is
knackered.
Have
you
ever
seen
Crucifixion's
a
doddle.
Don't
keep
saying
that.

Found
this
spoon,
sir.
Well
done,
sergeant.
We'll
be
back,
oddball.

You
haven't
given
us


-
In
that
time...
-
Holes
from
every
bitch
you
got
germs
from...
Don't
pass
judgement
or
you
might
-
What?
or
else
you
might
-
Who,
me?
-
Thank
you
very
much.
-
That's
a
nice
gourd.
-
How
much
do
you
want
for
the
gourd?
-
Have
it?
-
Don't
you
want
to
haggle?
-
What's
wrong
with
it?
-
Consider
the
lilies?
-
What
birds?
-
Why?
-
Who?
Have
the
birds
got
jobs?
-
What's
the
matter
with
him?
The
point
is,
the
birds,
-
Well,
good
luck
to
'em.
Okay.
And
you're
much
more
So
what
are
you
worrying
about?
I'm
worrying
about
what
I
haven't
got
anything
-
Consider
the
lilies.
-
Give
the
flowers
a
chance.
-
It's
yours.
Look,
there
was
this
man,
What
were
they
called?
I
don't
know.
-
You
don't
know?
He
doesn't
know
-
They
were
called
Simon
and
Adrian.
It
really
doesn't
matter.
The
point
is,
-
He's
making
it
up
as
he
goes
along.
And
he
gave
them...
-
Oh,
he's
terrible.
-
There
were
two
or
three.

Now
hear
this!
-
Three.
-
For
they
shall
inhibit
their
girth.
-
And
to
them
only
shall
be
given...
To
them
only...
shall
be
given...
-
What?
-
Shall
be
given
what?
-
What
were
you
going
to
say?
-
Yes,
you
were
going
to
say
something.
-
Tell
us
before
you
go.
-
No,
you
don't.
-
Won't
say!
-
Must
be,
otherwise
he'd
tell
us.
-
Leave
me
alone.
-
Is
it
the
secret
of
eternal
life?
If
I
knew
the
secret
-
Leave
me
alone!
-
We
were
here
first.
-
Go
away!
-
Is
that
his
gourd?
This
is
his
gourd.
-
Ten!
We
will
carry
it
-
Master?
-
He's
been
taken
up.

-
Nineteen!


Look!
Oh!
Oh!
He
has
given
us
a
sign.
He
has
given
us
his
shoe!
The
shoe
is
the
sign.
-
What?
For
this
is
his
sign
that
all
-
Yes!
that
we
must
gather
shoes
Cast
off
the
shoes.
No,
let
us
gather
shoes
No,
it
is
a
sign
that,
like
him,
we
must
but
of
the
face
and
head.
-
Give
me
your
shoe!
Follow
the
gourd,
-
The
gourd!
-
It
is
a
shoe!
-
No,
it
isn't!
-
Put
it
on!
Take
the
shoes

Come
back!
Stop!
Let
us...
Let
us
pray.
Yea,
he
cometh
to
us...
like
the
seeds
of
the
grain.

Master!
Master!
Hey!
Is
there
Is
there
another
path
Please,
please
help
me.

Oh,
my
foot!
Oh...
-
Shhh.
-
I'm
sorry.
-
I'm
sorry.
Shhh.
Eighteen
years
of
total
silence,
-
What?
Not
a
single,
recognizable,
Could
you
be
quiet
It
doesn't
matter
now.
For
the
last
18
years,
and
sing
and
scream
-
Shhh.
Shhh.
Hava
nagila,
hava
nagila
Hava
nagila...
Oh,
I'm
alive!
I'm
alive!
I'm
alive!
I'm
alive!
Hava
nagila
Master!
Master!
Master!
-
Master!
-
His
shoe
led
us
to
him!
Speak!
Speak
to
us,
master.
Go
away!

How
shall
we
go
away,
master?
Oh,
just
go
away
Give
us
a
sign!
He
has
given
us
a
sign!
I
didn't
bring
you
here.
Oh,
it's
still
a
good
sign
Master,
your
people
They
are
weary
It's
not
my
fault
There
is
no
food
What
about
the
juniper

He
has
made
the
bush
They've
brought
forth
Of
course!
They're
juniper
bushes!
Show
us
another
miracle.
Do
not
tempt
him,
shallow
ones!
Is
not
the
miracle
of
I
say,
those
-
They
are
a
gift
from
God.
I
say,
get
off
those
bushes.
Lord,
I
am
affected
I'm
healed!
I
didn't
touch
him!
I
was
blind,

-

I
hadn't
said
a
word
A
miracle!
He
hurt
my
foot!
-
Hurt
my
foot!
-
Hail
Messiah!
I
say
you
are,
Lord,
and
I
should
know.

I'm
not
the
Messiah!
I'm
not
the
Messiah!
Only
the
true
Messiah
What?
Well,
what
sort
of
chance
All
right,
He
is!
Now,
fuck
off!
How
shall
we
Just
leave
me
alone!
You
told
these
people
You
break
my
bloody
foot,
and
then
you
try
to
clean
up
-
Lay
off!
-
No,
he's
not.
-
An
unbeliever!

-
Seize
him!
Leave
him
alone!
Leave
him
alone.
Let
him
go!
Please!
-
Brian?

Look!
There
he
is!


-
Brian!
Shhh.
-
Hello,
Mother.
What
are
all
those
people
-
Well,
I...
I
think
they
must
have
Popped
by?
There's
a
multitude
out
there!
They
started
following
me
yesterday.
Well,
they
can
stop
Now,
stop
following
my
son!
You
ought
to
be
The
Messiah!
The
Messiah!
-
The
who?
There's
no
messiah
in
here.
There's
a
mess,
all
right,
Brian!
Brian!
Right,
my
lad.
-
Nothing,
Mum.
Well,
they
think
What
have
you
-
Nothing.
I
only...
-
I
can
explain.
-

Those
people
out
there
are
following
him
They
believe
he
can
give
them
hope...
a
new
world,
-
Who's
that?
That's
Judith,
Mum.
Hmm.
Aaah!
-
Ohhh!
Messiah!
Now,
you
listen
here.
He's
a
very
naughty
boy.
-
Who
are
you?
Behold
his
mother!
Hail
to
thee,
Blessed
art
thou!
All
praise
to
thee,
Well,
now
don't
think
He's
not
coming
out,
-
Now,
shove
off!
-
Did
you
hear
what
I
said?
Oh,
I
see.
-
Yes!
You
can
see
him
for
one
minute,
-
Do
you
understand?
-
Promise?
All
right,
here
he
is,
then.
-
But,
Mum,
Judith.
I
don't
really
want
to.
Brian!
Brian!

-
Good
morning.
No,
no.
Please.
I've
got
one
or
two
Tell
us!
Look,
you've
You
don't
need
to
follow
me.
You
don't
need
You've
got
to
think
You're
all
individuals.

You're
all
different.
Yes,
we're
all
different!
-
I'm
not.
You've
all
got
to
work
it
Yes,
we've
got
to
work
it
Exactly.
Tell
us
more!
No!
That's
the
point!
Otherwise...
Ow!
That's
enough.

-
Oh,
yes
it
was!
Now,
stop
that!

Excuse
me?

Are
you
a
virgin?
Well,

it's
not
a

How

Brian,
You
weren't
so
bad
yourself.
No.
What
you
said
just
now.
What?
We
don't
any
leaders.
-
Reg
has
been
dominating
us
for
too
long.
-
It
needed
saying,
and
you
said
it,
Brian.
It's
our
revolution.

I
think.
I
think...

The
revolution
is
in
your
hands!
No,

You're

Plenty
of
time.

Up

down
like
the
Assyrian
Empire.
Hello.
Reg!
-
Hello,
Sibling
Brian.
Well,
I
think
I
should
point
out
first,
Brian,
However,
I
have
been
asked
to
read
on
behalf
of
the
movement.
"We
the
People's
Front
of
Judea...
"do
hereby
convey
our
sincere
to
you,
Brian,
on
this,
-
What?
"in
the
continuing
struggle
"from
the
hands
of
the
Roman
"excluding
those
concerned
with
"education,
viniculture
and
any
"to
the
welfare
of
Jews
of
Signed,
on
behalf
And
I'd
just
like
to
add,
for
what
you're
doing
and
what
must
be,
after
all,
-
Reg,
w-what
are
you
going
to...
Well
done,
Brian.
Terrific
work,
Brian.

Right.
And...
For
he's
a
jolly
good
fellow
And
so
say
all
of
us
And
so
say
all
of...
You
bastards!
-
You
bastards!
You
sanctimonious
bastards!
-
I
have
an
order
for
his
release.
-
Uh,
I'm
Brian
of
Nazareth.

Yeah,
I-I-I'm
Brian
of
Nazareth.

Brian
of
Nazareth!

I'm
Brian!

I'm
Brian!

Brian!
Take
him
away
No,
I'm
only
joking.
I'm
not
I
was
only...
It
was
a
joke.
It's
a
joke!
I'm
not
him!
Bloody
Romans.


The
Judean
People's
Front!
Forward

Reg
has
explained
it
all
to
me.
Thank
you,
Brian.
I'll,
I'll
never
forget
you.
So
there
you
are!
I
might
have
known
To
think
of
all
the
love
and
Well,
if
that's
how
you
treat
in
the
autumn
years
all
I
can
say
is,
See
if
I
care.
-
Mum!
-
Mum!
Cheer
up,
Brian.
Some
things
in
life
are
bad.
They
can
really
make
you
mad.
Other
things
just
When
you're
chewing
Don't
grumble
And
this'll
help
things
And
Always
look

Always
look

If
life
seems
jolly
rotten
And
that's
to
laugh
and
smile
When
you're
feeling
in
the
dumps
Don't
be
silly
chumps
Just
purse
your
lips
and
And
always
look
-

Come
on!
Always
look

For
life
is
quite
absurd
And
death's
the
final
word
You
must
always
face
Forget
about
your
sin
Give
the
audience
a
grin
Enjoy
it,
it's
So
always
look

Just
before
you
draw

Life's
a
piece
of
shit
Life's
a
laugh
and
You'll
see
it's
all
a
show
Just
remember
that
And
always
look

Always
look
-


Always
look

Always
look
Worse
things
happen
Always
look
What
have
you
got
to
lose?
You
go
back
to
nothing.
-
Nothing!
Nothing
will
come
from
nothing.
-

Always
look
on
-

The
bright
side
of
life
See?
It's
the
end
of
the
film.
Incidentally,
Always
look
Who
do
you
think
pays
for
all
Always
look
I
told
him.
I
said
to
him,
"Bernie,
Always
look
