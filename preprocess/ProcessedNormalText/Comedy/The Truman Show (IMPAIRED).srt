YOU'D
MADE
SOMETHING
MORE
COME

WHO
HASN'T
HAD
AN
IMAGINARY
INTERVIEW
WHO

WANTED
THIS

DIFFERENT.
I'VE
BEEN
YOUR
BEST
FRIEND
THE
ONLY
WAY
YOU
AND
I
EVER
WAS
BY
CHEATING
OFF
JESUS,
THEY
WERE
IDENTICAL.
BUT
I
ALWAYS
FELT
SAFE
'CAUSE
WHATEVER
WE
WERE
RIGHT
TOGETHER
REMEMBER
WHEN
I
STAYED
UP
'CAUSE
YOU
WANTED
AND
I
GOT
PNEUMONIA?

YOU
REMEMBER
THAT?
YOU
WERE
OUT
OF
SCHOOL
YOU'RE
THE
CLOSEST
THING
I
KNOW
THAT
THINGS...
HAVEN'T
REALLY
WORKED
LIKE
WE
USED
TO
I
KNOW
THAT
FEELING,
WHEN
IT'S
LIKE
EVERYTHING'S
YOU
DON'T
WANT
SO
YOU
LOOK
FOR
ANSWERS
WELL...
Christof:
I'D
GLADLY
WALK
IN
FRONT
Marlon:
WELL...
THE
POINT
IS,
STEP
IN
FRONT
OF
TRAFFIC
AND
THE
LAST
THING
AND
THE
LAST
THING
IS
LIE
TO
YOU.
I
MEAN,
THINK
ABOUT
IT,
IF
EVERYBODY
I'D
HAVE
TO
BE
I'M
NOT
IN
ON
IT,
THERE
IS
NO
"IT."
YOU
WERE
RIGHT
ABOUT
WHAT'S
THAT?
THE
THING
THAT
YEP.
I
FOUND
HIM
THAT'S
WHY
I'M
SURE
HE'S
GOT
GO
TO
HIM.
EASY
ON
THE
FOG.

STAND
BY,
CRANE

CRANE
CAM.
BUTTON

SON!
OH!
MOVE

AN
AUDIENCE

OF
ONLY
2
MANMADE
STRUCTURES
NOW
IN
ITS
30th
GREAT
YEAR,
IT'S...
WHAT
A
WEEK
IT'S
BEEN.
I
WAS
ON
PINS
AND
NEEDLES
HELLO
AND
GOOD
EVENING.
AND
WELCOME
TO

TRU-TALK,
OUR
FORUM
FOR
ISSUES
BUT
TONIGHT,
A
RARE
AND
WITH
THE
SHOW'S
SO,
COME
WITH
US
NOW
AS
WE
ON
THE
221st
FLOOR
WHERE
WE'LL
FIND
THE
WORLD'S
THE
DESIGNER
AND
ARCHITECT
THAT
IS
SEAHAVEN
ISLAND--
BEFORE
WE
BEGIN,
ON
BEHALF
OF
OUR
AUDIENCE
WE
KNOW
HOW
DEMANDING
AND
WE
ALL
KNOW
HOW
JEALOUSLY
THIS,
SIR,
DON'T
MENTION
IT.
WELL,
THE
CATALYST
FOR
ON
THE
SHOW
HAS
BEEN
AND
HIS
ATTEMPTS
BUT
BEFORE
WE
GET
INTO
THAT,
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
FIRST
TIME
HAS
ATTEMPTED
Christof:
WE
HAVE
HAD
Man:
TRUMAN!
YES!
YES!
I
DID
IT!
I'M
ON

THE
TRUMAN
SHOW!
Mike:
BUT
THERE'S
NEVER
WITH
THIS
MOST
RECENT
THE
FIRST
INTRUDER
TO
BE
A
DEAD
ONE
AT
THAT.
GOTTA
SAY,
WRITING
KIRK
SINCE
KIRK
STARTED
THIS
I
CAME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
TRUMAN!
TRUMAN!
NO!

THAT'S
OFF
LIMITS!
WHY?
WHAT'S
NOTHING.
IT'S
DANGEROUS.
YOU'VE
GOT
TO
KNOW
Mike:
BUT
LET'S
REMIND
DAD
WAS
WRITTEN
OUT
Christof:
AS
TRUMAN
GREW
UP,
TO
MANUFACTURE
WAYS
I'D
LIKE
TO
BE
LIKE
THE
GREAT
YOU'RE
TOO
LATE.
THERE'S
REALLY

Christof:
FINALLY,
I
CAME
UP
Mike:
MOST
EFFECTIVE.
TRUMAN'S
BEEN
TERRIFIED
Christof:
WHEN
KIRK
READ
HE
WAS
DISAPPOINTED
JESUS!
I'M
SURE
THAT'S
WHAT
CAUSED
BUT
HOW
DO
YOU
INTEND
TO
AMNESIA.
BRILLIANT.
LET'S
TAKE
CHARLOTTE,
NORTH
CAROLINA,
Man:
UH,
YEAH,
I
WAS
WONDERING
HOW
MANY
SOMEWHERE
IN
Man:
THAT'S
REMEMBER,
WE
STARTED
HE
WAS
CURIOUS
PREMATURE
BY
2
WEEKS.
ALMOST
AS
IF
HE
COULDN'T
Mike:
HIS
EAGERNESS
WAS
THE
VERY
REASON
IN
COMPETITION
WITH
5
OTHER
THE
CASTING
OF
A
SHOW,
TRUMAN
WAS
THE
ONE
Mike:
INCIDENTALLY,
I
BELIEVE
TO
HAVE
BEEN
LEGALLY
ADOPTED
THAT'S
CORRECT.
THE
SHOW
HAS
GENERATED
EQUIVALENT
TO
THE
GROSS
NATIONAL
PEOPLE
FORGET
IT
TAKES
OF
AN
ENTIRE
COUNTRY
TO
SINCE
THE
SHOW
IS
ON
WITHOUT
COMMERCIAL
INTERRUPTION,
ARE
GENERATED
THAT'S
TRUE.
EVERYTHING
FROM
THE
ACTOR'S
WARDROBE,
TO
THE
VERY
HOMES
Mike:
AND
ALL
OF
IT
AVAILABLE
OPERATORS
ARE
STANDING
BY.
CHRISTOF,
LET
ME
ASK
YOU,
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
TRUMAN
TO
DISCOVERING
THE
TRUE
NATURE
WE
ACCEPT
THE
REALITY
WITH
WHICH
WE
ARE
IT'S
AS
SIMPLE
AS
THAT.
THE
HAGUE
FOR
CHRISTOF.
HELLO?
THE
HAGUE?
ALL
RIGHT,
LET'S
GO
TO
HOLLYWOOD.
HI,
CHRISTOF.
I'D
JUST
YOU'RE
A
LIAR
AND
WHAT
YOU'VE
DONE
WELL,
WE
REMEMBER
HOW
COULD
WE
FORGET?
Mike:
LET'S
GO
NO,
NO,
NO.
I
LOVE
TO
REMINISCE
WITH
SYLVIA...
AS
YOU
ANNOUNCED
SO
YOU
THINK
BECAUSE
YOU
BATTED
FLIRTED
WITH
HIM...
STOLE
A
FEW
MINUTES
TO
THRUST
YOURSELF
AND
YOUR
THAT
YOU
KNOW
HIM?
THAT
YOU
KNOW
YOU
REALLY
THINK
YOU'RE
WHAT
RIGHT
DO
YOU
HAVE
AND
TURN
HIS
LIFE
INTO
DON'T
YOU
EVER
I
HAVE
GIVEN
TRUMAN
A
CHANCE
THE
WORLD...
THE
PLACE
YOU
LIVE
IN...
IS
THE
SICK
PLACE.
SEAHAVEN'S
THE
WAY
HE'S
NOT
A
PERFORMER.
LOOK
AT
HIM!
LOOK
AT
HE
CAN
LEAVE
AT
ANY
TIME.
IF
HIS
WAS
MORE
IF
HE
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
DETERMINED
THERE'S
NO
WAY
I
THINK
WHAT
DISTRESSES
IS
THAT
ULTIMATELY...
TRUMAN
PREFERS
HIS
CELL,
THAT'S
WHERE
YOU'RE
SO
WRONG,
AND
Mike:
WELL,
ASIDE
FROM
OF
A
VERY
IT'S
BEEN
AN
OVERWHELMINGLY
YES.
FOR
TRUMAN
AND
WELL,
CHRISTOF,
FOR
GIVING
SO
GENEROUSLY
I
THINK
IT'S
SAFE
TO
SAY
NOW
AND
TRUMAN
IS
BACK
WE
CAN
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
SOME
WELL,
MIKE,
THE
BIG
NEWS
IS
THAT
MERYL
IN
AN
UPCOMING
EPISODE,
AND
A
NEW
ROMANTIC
INTEREST
