have
any
idea
the
people
before
you?
Geraldine
Page,
Helen
Hayes,
Jason
Robards,
Marlon
Brando

Well,
it's
a
good
theater.
I
can't
speak
for
your
play,
let's
do
Oh,
I
didn't
expect
you
you
know,
just
jump
right
in.
It's
first
preview
Let's-let's
get
to
work.
Okay.
Well,
you
know,
look,
feel
free
to
take
the
script
up
No,
no,
no,
no,
let's
just...
All
right.
Okay,
uh,
hey,
take
I-I'm
good;
I
don't
need
that.
What?
I
don't
need
the
script.
Just
give
me
a
cue.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Feed
me
a
line.
Well,
how-how...
how
are
you
gonna...
Feed
me
a
line.
Okay,
all
right.
Okay,
uh,
let
me
think.
Uh...
Yeah,
uh...
Hey,
I'm
the
wrong
I
didn't
actually
I
only
heard
his
name
Mm-hmm.
I
don't
know.
You'd
have
to
know
but
I
think
what
you're
saying
Is
that
what
I'm
saying?
Am
I
saying
love
is
absolute?
Yes.
Okay,
yeah.
The
kind
of
love
that
The
kind
of
love
You
don't
try
to
kill
people.
How
do
you
know
the
lines?
It's
a
thing
I
have.
I
don't
know,
it's
a
gift.
Wow,
okay,
well,
that's...

I've
been...
get
off
book
for
like
a
month.

lines
are...

makes
sense.
Right,
right,
right.
That's
good.
Okay,
okay.
Give
me
my
cue
again.
Hey,
I'm
the
wrong
I
didn't
actually
I've
heard
his
name
but,
you
know,
I
didn't
know.
You
never
know
the
particulars.
I
think
what
you're
saying,
C-Can
I
make
a
suggestion?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
sure.
I
mean,
do
you
mind?
No,
no,
no,
not
at
all.
Oh,
okay.
Take
a
look.
Okay.
No,
no,
for-forget
that.
Just-just...
Yeah.
"I'm
the
wrong
person
Right.
but
what
is
that?
What's
the
I
think...
Is
he
fed
up
with
the
subject,
Is
he
deflecting
guilt
And
here's
the
thing,
you've
got
that
all
say
Right.
"I
didn't
even
know
the
man."
"I-I
only
heard
his
name
"I
wouldn't
know."
"You'd
have
to
know
And
the
particulars,
I
mean,
but-but-but
the
point
is,
you
don't
know
the
guy.
Right.
We
fucking
get
it.
Yeah.
Make
it
work
with
one
line.
"I
didn't
even
know
the
man."
Right?
Yeah,
right.

Wait,
how-how
do...
You
know
my
lines,
too,
huh?
C-Can
we
not
get
hung
up
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Can
we
just
work
on
this,
Yeah,
yeah,
right,
right.
tear
it
apart,
whatever?
So-so-so
why
don't
you
just
but
cut
it
down.
Uh-huh.
Try
it.
Just
try
it.
Okay.
Uh...
Hey,
I'm
the
wrong
I
didn't
actually
know
the
guy.
Oh!
No!
But
that's
the
thing,
see?
"I'm
the
wrong
person
to
ask."
I
think
it's
"fuck
you."
Fuck
you.
Don't-don't
put
me
I...
Don't-don't
make
me
feel
self-conscious
about
my
marriage
while
my
l...
Right
there.
...right
there.
Yeah.
Can
I
sit
down
for
this?
Yeah,
sit,
sit.
Okay.
Thanks.
Yeah.
So-so
just-just
give
it
to
me
as
a
"fuck
you."
Right.
Try
it,
lay
it
on
me.
Yeah.
Let's
just
do
it.
Come
on.
Give
it
to
me.
Fuck
me
hard.
Well,
