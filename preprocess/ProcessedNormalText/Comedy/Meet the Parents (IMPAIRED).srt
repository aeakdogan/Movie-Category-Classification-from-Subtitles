That's...
Yeah,
makes
sense.
But
he
doesn't

Every

I
had
to

He

I
don't.
I
don't

That's
0K.
Just
be
honest
about

I'm
being
honest,
really.
Like
what?
Why
don't
we
let
the
kids
freshen
up?
Greg,
we'll
get
you

Well,
we'll
look
forward
to
that.

So,
uh,
Greg,
how's
your
job?
Um,
good,
Pam.
Thanks
for
asking.
I
recently
got
transferred
to
triage.
Is
that
better
than
a
nurse?
No,
Mom,
triage
is
a
unit
of
the
ER.
-
Well...
Not
many
men
in
your
profession.
No,
Jack.
Not
traditionally.
Mm-hm.
Pam,
did
you
know
that

father
Really?
Dad,
that's
great!
0h,
wow!
Yes,
I
thought
with
my
experience,
I
really
admire
that.
So
what
is
it?
What's...?
0h,
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
Greg.
Let's

know
for
certain
that
your
loved
ones
I
mean,
can
you
ever
really
trust
Sure.
I
think
so.
No.
The
answer
is
you
cannot.
Let
me
show
you
something.
Take
a
look
at
this,
Greg.
What's
this
look
like
to
you?
It
looks
like

So

Couldn't
this
be
construed
Greg,
when
you
have
little
Fockers
you'll
see
the
need
for
protection.

Yeah.
-
Impressive,
isn't
it?

I'll
get
that.

Any

know

just
goes.
Well,

You'll
need

show
up.
Don't
take
a
chance.
You
don't
Yeah.

want

No,

Some

that...
To

means...
they're

Good

What's
the
matter
with
you?

My

Focker?

Hey,

suitcase.
Yeah,
it's
fine.
What's
up?
Just
want
to
make
sure
you're
0K
-
I'm
really
sorry
about
that.
I
don't

Stop

Iceman,
Do
you
wanna
be
Maverick?
I
can't
be,
Kevin's
Maverick.
No,
he
used
to
be,
Can
he
be
Goose?
No,
because
Goose
dies
in
the
end.
It's
very
sad.
-
Honey,
I
don't...
0K.
Dad!
You
ever
think
of
knocking?
Not
in
my
own
den.
I'd
say
rounding

This

Dad.
Not

Fine.
Come

Meet
you

They
found
your
suitcase.
I
don't
know
but
if
I
gave
you
regarding
Pam
in
any
way,
I
have
the
best
intentions
with
Pam.
Actually,
that
I
plan
to
give
her
symbolizes...

..the
level
of
my
commitment
to
her.
And
I
wouldn't
feel
right
without
her
father's
Did
you
flush
this
toilet?
Maybe...
You
know
what?
I
saw
Jinxy
come
in
last
night
Jinx
knows
not
to
use
that
toilet.
What
does
it
matter?
The
matter,
Greg
RN,
is
when
With
a
near-full
septic
tank
you
could
have
a
problem.
Mr.
Byrnes?

This
is
not
part
Nice
stench.
Bite
me,
Denny.
In
20
hours
there's
a
wedding
here,
Not
tomorrow,
now!
Dad,
what's
going
on?
0h,
my
God.
What's
that
smell?
That
smell,
Bob,
is
our
shit.
Focker
made
the
septic
tank
overflow.
Jack,
I
told
you
it
wasn't
me.
Focker,
I'm
not
gonna
tell
you
again!
He's
a
cat,
for
Christ's
sakes!
He
doesn't
have
thumbs,
Focker!

at
this!

That's
what
I
said
I
wanted
But
do
you
think
that
in
some
crazy
scheme
to
turn
-
'I
don't
think
so,
sir.'
Jinxy,
stop.
I
know
I
signed
for
it...
Do
me
a
favor.
-
Hmm?
What's
your
name?
-
Get
me
your
supervisor.
When
he
gets
back,
It's
a
very
important
bag.

Jinx!
Don't
ask
me
what
for,
I'm
in
a

situation

The
fact
is,
Greg
lied
to

He
did
not

You
should
know
the
truth.
I
love

yard,
He's
not
up
in
the
trees.

Jinx
isn't
up
here.
You
tried
to
milk
him,
Dad,

it!
That's
enough!
Please
calm
down.
How?

He

Jinx
to
walk

didn't,
Dad.
Yeah,

this
around
the
neck

Dad.
Bob,

you
say
that?
That

That's

No,
I'm
sorry
about

Looks
just

Almost.
Except
for
that
tail.

Mr.
Jinx.
Yeah,

I'll

Hey,

the
man
of
the
hour.
Sorry,
folks.
Had
to
pay
Greg,
nice
work
with
the
cat
today.
Thanks,
Jack.
Glad
I
could
help.
Hey,

So
there
is
still
something
We'll
get
right
to
it
I'm
gonna
hold
you
to
that.
Guess
who's
back
in



Whoo!
0h,
poor
Kevin
looks
lonely.
I
should
ask
him
to
dance.
Sure.
He
could,
uh,
whittle
I'm
serious.
He's
very
handy.
and
crafty
craftsman.
I
shouldn't
say
that,
but...
Come
on,
seriously.
Part
of
you
Yes,
he's
very
talented.
But
it
would
have
never
worked
out.
Why
not?
I
was
never
in
love
with
Kevin.
I'm
in
love
with
you.
-
That's
a
good
explanation.
-
Thought
you'd
like
that.
I'm
glad.
No,
Jinx.
Mr.
Jinx.
0K,

is
a
great
party.
Sometimes
things
just
come
together
Yeah.
Like
the
way
you
found
Jinxy
Yeah-huh.
Right.
-
Well,
he's
home
now.
You
know,
just
puts
a
big
smile
on
my
face.
-
Mm.
You
haven't
seen
his
new
tricks?
No.
Mm-mm.
-
Well,
I'll
show
you.

He's
probably
tired.

Honey,
I'll
drive.

Hey,
Larry,

don't
I
drive?
I've
always
wanted
Be
my
guest,

Everybody

You're
a
little
wild
man

Yeah,
just
trying
to
make
good
time.
What
is
the
matter
with
you?
All
right,

Whoa!
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
It's
not
the
autobahn!


Maybe
you
0h,
no.
0h,
no,
please.

Yes!
You
were
supposed
to
make
that
left

I'm
gonna
be
sick.

Where
is
he
going?

Home,
home,
home.

What
a
ride.

Who
gave
him
the
keys?

Does
he
have
a
license?

Hey,
nice
driving,
Mario!
Lunatic.
You're
a
lunatic!

Aw,
leave
him
alone.

It's
everything!
God

you,
Jinx!
I'll
get
you...!
Dad!
Hey,

out!
You

his
tail
to
make
What's
he
talking
about?
Hank
Macatee
called
me
He
put
his
collar
on
an
impostor,
then
he
tried
to
beat
us
back
0h,
no,
he...
Please
tell
me
that's
not
true,
Greg.
It
was
just
a
temporary
solution
How
could
you
do
something
like
that?
I'm
sorry.
What
are
you
gonna
say
next
-
0h,
my
God!
Well,
it
wasn't
intentional.
I
had
a
smoke,
I
don't
know.
He
put
so
much...
It
was
an
accident
waiting
to
happen!
This
is
very
disappointing,
Greg.
Get
out
of
my
house,
Focker,
So
you
lied
about
everything?
-
The
MCATs...
Pam,
don't
you
see?
I
didn't
turn
her
against
you.
Jack,
you
didn't
like
me
I'm
a
very
accepting
person,
Focker.
You
want
honesty?
You
wanna
talk
about
0K,
let's
talk
a
little
operation...
Ko
Samui...
-
Jack.
I
thought
there
weren't
any
secrets
-
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
Cat
got
your
tongue?
Pam,
Daddy's
planning
for
the
day
after
the
wedding.
You
are?
Round
and
round
we
go,
Jack.
They'd
love
to
hear
about
You
know,
where
the
guy
gave
you
0r
your
little
phone
call
in
Thai?

Jack
can't
talk
Thai.
0h,
no,
Dina,
Jack
can
talk
Thai.
I'm
sorry,
Pam,
He's
still
very
much
in
the
CIA.
Daddy?
He...he's
right.
He's
right.
I...I
am
planning
a
secret
operation
What?
A
surprise
honeymoon
for
Deb
and
Bob.
You
stupid
son
of
a
bitch!
What?
Ko
Samui's
an
island
That
guy
in
the
parking
lot
He
was
giving
me
their
visas!
Wow,
Thailand.
Don't
mention
it.
I
just...
You
know,
if
nursing
doesn't
work

Thanks,
Greg.
Well,
I
guess
I'm
gonna
I
guess
you're
gonna
stay
here?
Pam,
I...
It's
0K.
It's
0K.
Gaylord
M.
Focker?
"Gaylord"?
Yeah,
that's
me.
-
I
thought
your
name
was
Greg.
-
That's
not
on
the
form.
since
I
was
in
third
grade.


Whatever.
Wait,
wait,
wait.

-
Denny.
It's
not
a
normal
name,
you
know?
You're
in
luck.
There
is
room...

And
without
a
Saturday
stay-over
$1,137
and
11
cents.
-
Did
you
want
me
to
book
this
seat?
-

We
should
be
all
right
I'm
not
so
sure,
Jack.
Thought
you
might
like
to
see
this.
-
How
did
you
get
this?
I
called
Gaylord
-
They
saved
his
SAT
scores,
too,
0h,
honey,
it
doesn't
matter
Look
at
this!
He
almost
destroyed
I
love
you,
Daddy...
but
you
can
be
a
real
jerk
sometimes.
So
what
if
he
took
the
MCATs?
Who
is,
Jack?
Nobody
has
ever
been
good
enough
I
mean,
do
you
realize
that
you
until
she
broke
up
with
him?
Maybe
it's
time
you
think
Greg,
it's
me.
I'm
sure
you're
in
the
air
by
now,
so,
um,
I
guess
you'll
get
this
Um...
Listen,
I
am
so
sorry.
I
acted
like
And
I
hope
that
you
can
forgive
me.
I
mean,
I...I
don't
care
about...
the
fire
or
the
cat
or...
I
mean,
I
can't
believe
you
It's
actually
really
gross.
But
the
point
is
that...
that
I
understand
and
I
love
you.
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
really,

anyone
anything
Unless
you

No

Did
you
do

You're

know
that?
Is
your

Gaylord
Focker?
Yes.
