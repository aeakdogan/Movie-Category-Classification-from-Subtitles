just
outside

I'll

And
make

maker's
tied

We
don't

Hey,
Marshall,

Maybe
Stu
wasn't
clear.
We
don't
actually
have
Chow,

hoping

...could
go
to
Caesars
and
get
him.

Oh,

It's
great
to
be

So
many
good
memories.
Okay,
so
here's
the
deal:
You
need
a
key
just
to
get
onto
his
floor.
And
then
once
you're
there,
It's
ridiculous.
Let
me
guess,
that's
him?
PHIL:
I
gut
an
idea.
But
you're
not
gonna
like
it.
It's
not
gonna
work.

did
you
do?
I
unlocked
the
latch
And
left
him
his
gun?
Yeah,
I
didn't
think
it
He
gave
Chow
a
fighting
chance.
That's
all
I
ever
need.
CHOW:
Fat

It's
never
easy,
is
it?
Na

Well,

We'll

Did
you
know
that
just
a
couple
blocks
there's
a
place
that
lacks
exactly
I
can't
remember
what
it's
called,
It's
called
Paris
Hotel
and
Casino,
Yeah,
that's
it.
Well,
I'd
like
to
take
you
to
dinner
there.
Oh,
sorry.
Na

Oh,

I'm
banned
from
the
casino
for

Plus
10
years.
I

her
birthday,
She
split
10s.

Oh.
They
said
it
was
abuse
of
an
elderly.
Ha,

I've
done
that.
Heh.
Right?
Whatever.
I
can't
go
back
there.
But,

Golden
Nugget

best
prime
rib
Well,

Is
that
it'?

I
saw
it
once
in
a
pornography.
Oh.
It's
a
nice
gesture.
But
maybe
we
should
wait.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.

I'll
see
you
at
8.
You

Thank

Cassie
picked
it
out
for
me.
You
lack
like
Mr.
Peanut.
Yeah,
I
know,
right?
-
Maybe
we'll
just
lose
it.
Hey,
Alan,
I
was
just
talking
to
Cassie.
Oh,
thank
you
for
saying
that.
I
find
her
much
better
than
your
wives.
Aw.
That's
sweet.
Which
reminds
me.
All
right,
listen,
fellas.
New
that
I'm
getting
married,

Yeah.
It's
the
way
it
should
be.
There's
more.
And
you're
not
gonna
like
this
part.
I
must
resign
from
the
wolf
pack.
Wow,
that's
a
big
step,
Alan.
ALAN:
I
know.
But
she's
my
soul
mate.
And
my
new
best
friend.
Plus,
she
lets
me
mount
her...
which
relaxes
me.
Oh,

Gad.
Alan,
maybe
never
say
that
part
again.
Chillax,
Doug,
we're
all
adults
here.
I
know

my
sister.
What?
Alan,

the
best.
The
paint
is:
You
need
to
let
me
go.
You
in
particular.
I
can't
be
your
hero
anymore.
Okay.
