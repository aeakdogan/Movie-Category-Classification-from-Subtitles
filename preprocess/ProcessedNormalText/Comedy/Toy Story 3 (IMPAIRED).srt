We'll
be
fine,

donate
them
to
Sunnyside?
Mom,
no
one's
going
to
want
those
old
toys.
They're
junk.
Anything
that's
not

Push!
Push!
It's

any
sense.
It's

Andy's
mom
thought

Ohh!

Here
comes
Buster.
Ok.
Andy's
out
in
the

He's
looking
in
the
attic.
Why
is
he
so
upset?
Oh
no.
Oh,
this
is
terrible!
He's
looking
for
us.
He's
looking
for
us?
Andy
does
want
us!
I
just
knew
it!
Well,
then
Woody
was
telling
the
truth.
Hey,
you
didn't
believe
him
first.
Lotso!
Thank
goodness.
Have
you

If
any
of

you
tell

that

But,
how'd
you
escape?
What
do
you
mean
"escape"?
Sunnyside

but
inside,
he's
a
monster.
Chuckles.
He'll
tell
you.
Yeah,
I
knew
Lotso.
He
was
a
good
toy.
A
friend.
Me
and
him,
we
had
the
same
kid.
Daisy.
I
was
there
when
Lotso
got
unwrapped.
Daisy
loved
us
all.
They
did
everything
together.
I've
never
seen
a
kid
One
day
we
took
a
drive.
At
a
rest
stop,
we
had
a
little
playtime.
After
lunch,
Daisy
fell
asleep.
She
never
came
back.
Lotso
wouldn't
give
up.
It
took
forever,
but
we
finally
But
by
then,
it
was
too
late.
Something
changed
that
day
inside
Lotso.
Something
snapped.
Come
on.
She
replaced
all
of
us.
She
don't
love
you
no
more.
Now,
come
on!
We
were
lost.
Cast
off.
Unloved,
unwanted.
Then
we
found
Sunnyside.
But
Lotso
wasn't
my
friend
anymore.
He
wasn't
anyone's
friend.
He
took
over
Sunnyside
and
So,
how'd
you
get
out?
Bonnie
found
me.
Took
me
home.
It
ain't
right
what
Lotso
done.
But
my
friends
are
in
there.
Returning
now
would
be
suicide.
Isn't
he
leaving
for
college?
Quiet,
musical
hog!
Knock
it
off!
Oh,
Bull's-eye.
I
miss
Woody
too.
But
he
ain't
ever
coming
back.
Rise
and

All

Nothing

Lotso
did
something
to

Oh
no!
Woody,

were
wrong
to
leave

Jessie's
right,
Woody.
She
was
wrong.
No,
no,
it's

for

From
now
on,

Wait.
What

Daisy?
I
don't
know

talking
about.
Yeah,

she
threw
us

She
replaced
us.

not
such
a
great
idea.
We're
Andy's
toys,
Woody.
Together.
I
just
hope
he
hasn't

yet.
Andy's

He
lives
halfway
across

Come

Yeah,
just

Oh,

this
isn't

Hey,

Have

Woody,

Tell
him

Besides,
I

You
know
where
to

Did
you
say

know.
It's
just

I
wish
You
will
be,

Of

So,

really
think
It's

to
you,
Honey.
Don't
go
in
there!
The

Are
you
crazy?
You'll
wake
up
all
the

Look

The

are

Mom!
I
hear
you're
off
to

So,
what
can
we
do
for
you?
You

that,
