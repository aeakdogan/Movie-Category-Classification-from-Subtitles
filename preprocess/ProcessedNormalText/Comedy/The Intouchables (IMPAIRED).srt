Philippe,

euros
-
Philippe.
Here
we
go.
-


-
You're
in
shape.
God!
-

Shit!
Fuck!
So
you
lost
them?
Get
out!
Hands
on
the
hood!
-
Get
out!
You'll
lose
again.
-
Two
hundred,
an
escort!
Let's
see
your
hands!
Your
goddamn
hands!
Let
me
explain.
Shut
your
mouth
Hold
on.
-
Let
go!
He
can't
get
out!
-
What?
There's
a
wheelchair
in
the
trunk!
Go
and
check!
Take
a
look.
Let
go
of
me.
Yeah.
Well?
What
is
this?
You
think
I
drive
that
fast
We're
heading
for
the
hospital.
He's
having
a
fit,
OK.
It's
an
emergency!
-
He
can't
move!
I'm
his
caregiver.
We
have
a
problem.
Look.

What
do
we
do?

Know
what?
Think
it
over.
Then
call
his
kid
and
say
In
five
minutes,
he'll
be
a
goner,
-
So
take
your
time.
Go
on,
think
it
over!
OK,
get
going.



-
Where
are
you
heading?
We'll
escort
you,
it's
safer.
We're
escorting
them.
Let's
go!

-
It's
OK,
they're
splitting.
-
This
is
really
gross,
Philippe.
Freaks
me
out.
Maybe
you
should
take
Yes,
but
for
now,
An
escort
at
200
euros.
I
never
wager
such
large
sums.
-
This
calls
for
a
change
of
mood.
"We'll
escort
you,
it's
safer."
Come
on,
I
helped
you
out.
Philippe,
the
escort...
[Earth,
Wind
&
Fire's
We'll
escort
you,
it's
safer!

-


They're
bringing
a
stretcher.
-
Yes,
fine.
Goodbye.

What
do
we
do
now?
You
let
me
handle
it
now.

I

Uh
yeah?

I
can't

now.
-
Why
not?
That's
a
bummer.
I'm
already
late
handing
it
in.
That's
a
bummer
as
you
say.

Can't

for
you?
Too
bad,
she

it
up

at
nine.
I'd
hate
to

I
won't
see
you
out.
No,
don't
get
up.
I
mean,
stay
seated.
I'll
come
back
tomorrow.



-
Mina,
is
she
here?
No,
she'll
be
back
late.
No...
Hey.
Turn
the
tap
off
-
Turn
the
tap
off!
Get
out
of
here!
I'm
taking
a
shower!
-
Leave
me
be!
Get
them
out.
Go
on.
Bintou,
I'm
serious!
Mina!
Get
them
out!
Get
out
with
your
big
belly.
Let
go!
Get
out!
Out,
you
lot!
Get
it?
-
Hey,
Bintou.
Bintou,
what
the
hell?
Sit
down,
you!

-
Where
were
you?
Where
are
you
going?
-
Horse-riding.

Here,
it's
for
you.
Where
were
you?
-
On
vacation.
People
talk
around
here.
You
think
I'm
a
dumb
bitch?
Six
months
without
seeing
you.
Not
one
phone
call.
And
now
you
turn
up
You
think
your
scams
for
food?


Look
at
me
when
I
talk
to
you!
Idiot!
There's
no
talking
to
you!
Want
to
talk?
OK.
I'm
listening.
I'm
listening.
You
know,
Driss,
But,
God
forgive
me,
I
still
have
hope
for
them.
I
don't
want
you
coming
back
here.
Just
pack
up
your
bags
Is
that
clear?
Get
out.
Get
out!

That
was
a
good
one,
right?
Know
what?
I'm
going.
-
It
wasn't
funny?
It
wasn't
funny?





-

Yes?
-
I
was
expecting
you.

-
Come
in.


Tell
Philippe
he's
here.
Right
away.
Well?
No
beetroot,
Good.
Hello.
Come
along.
I'm
warning
you,
he
had
a
bad
night.
Like
you
apparently.
His
day
begins
at
7:00
a.m.
He
needs
two
to
three
hours
of
care
Many
applicants
throw
in
the

We
see
a
lot
of
them.
I
like
the
decor,
but
I'm
not
buying
I
was
told
to
show
you
around.
Anyhow,
it's
nearly
over.

communicate,
It's

is

And
you
have
a
separate
bathroom.
Oh...
This
way.


He's
expecting
you.
Just
a
minute.

-

It's
on
the
table
over
there.
So
you
like
being
assisted?
What?
You
don't
mind
It's
not
a
problem
for
you?
No.
How
about
you?
Do
you
think
you're
capable
of

A
sense
of
humor
after
all.
And
I'm
ready
to
try
you
out
You
have
a
day
to
think
it
over.
I
bet
you
won't
last
two
weeks.


What?

No
bone,
no
muscle
should
be
ignored.
Keep
the
skin
and
joints
To
do
that,
and
strict.
Wake
up!
You
sleep
at
night!
I'm
not
asleep.
Help
me.
Let's
put
Philippe
in
his
chair...
...and
get
him
to
the
shower.
I
know...
Try
it
on
your
own.
Show
me.
Don't
be
scared.
Go
on.
I'm
not
scared.
Happy
flow?
-

Never
let
him
go
Yes,
I'm
kinky
that
way.
No
one
told
me.
I'm
in
training.
Do
you
want
white
gloves
or
what?
The
shampoo's
weird,
-
How's
it
going?
What?
I
don't
believe
it.
That's
his

cream.
Hold
on.
Don't
tell
me
you
can't
read,
Driss!
Sure
I
can,
but...
You
seem
pretty
gifted.
Usually
it's
one
for
the
whole

This
guy
has
20.
I'm
not
spending
all

here.
This
one
then?
The
one
marked

Will
you
manage?
Of
course
he
will.
My
feet
are
beautifully
coiffed.
Go
and
have
lunch,
Marcelle.
Where's
the
skirt?
They're
support
stockings.
so
I
don't
faint.
I'm
not
doing
that.
There's
a
problem
here.
Seeing
as
how
I
won't
be
doing
it,
we
need
to
see
if...
Maybe
Marcelle
could
come
back
She
knows
how
to
do
it,
I'm
just
not
doing
it,
OK.
You're
better
off
fainting.
I
mean,
sometimes...
We
just
refuse
to
put
them
on.
No
way,
Marcelle!
You're
good
with
stockings.
Only
natural
with
that
cute
earring.
-
Can
we
cut
the
joking?
You're
a
natural
at
this.
Haven't
you
ever
considered
work...
...as
a
beautician?

OK,
that's
done.
What
are
the
gloves
for?
Let's
wait
a
while.

No,
he's
not
quite
ready.
What
do
you
mean,
-
What
is
this?
We
need
to
talk,
Marcelle!
Ready
or
not,
I'm
not
emptying
the
ass
Or
even
of
a
guy
I
do
know.
I
don't
empty
anyone's
ass,
Can
I
finish
eating
first?
No.
Let's
just
leave
it
at
this.
I
don't
go
for
this
sick
stuff.
The
stockings
were
bad
enough.
But
I
met
you
part
way.
Your
turn.
-
I
get
the
message.
Just
drop
it.
Enjoy
your
lunch.

Beautiful,
huh?
I
love
it.

Don't
mind
me.
You're
not
at
the
movies,
Hi.
Where
can
I
find
a
beer?
Maybe
in
your
wig.

-
You
took
both
packs?
-
Take
your
mop-head
for
a
walk.
-
He's
the
guy
my
dad
hired.
The
guy
has
a
name.

-
What?
-
What's
going
on?
-
You're
sure?
Just
massaging
away.

Fucking
weird.
Have
you
finished
playing?
You
can't
feel
a
thing?
Have
you
gone
mad?!
He's
experimenting.
-
He
can't
feel
a
thing.

-

Lawyer.
No.
That's
personal.

The
"personal"
file?
OK.
Trash.
She's
not
bad.
How
about
a
"hooker"
file?

Enjoy
your
meal.

Thank
you.
Do
you
mind?
Oh.
Hey.
Sorry.
Excuse
me.

Shit,
I
keep
forgetting.
-
Shit,
sorry.

That
feels
good.

Driss,
come
here,
please.
-

Come
here,
please.
-

-

-

It's
nearly
nine.
Philippe's
waiting.

Nine
already?
What
a
pigsty-
Can
you
make
my
coffee?
The
baby
monitor!

And
Nutella!
Not
that
jam
made
with
weird
fruit!


I'm
not
getting
in
this.
And
I'm
not
loading
you
What's
this?
That
one's
less
suitable.
Meaning?
Unfortunately,
Pragmatic?


Holy
fuck.
-

-
It
feels
so
good.
This
is
good.
She's
nervy.
-
Let's
go!


The
neighbor
keeps
parking
there.
He
thinks
it's
his
space.

Not
for
much
longer.

-

How's
it
going?
Am
I
bothering
you,
Blondie?
-
What?!
Come
on.
-
Go
on,
read
this!
Louder!
-

-
Read
it
all.
Get
that
into
your
thick
skull
Go
on,
Blondie,
piss
off!
We
open
Tuesday.

Can
we
go?
You've
been
there
an
hour.
There's
a
lot
of
serenity
in
it.
It's
very
touching.
Touching?
Red
splashes
on
white?
How
much
is
it?
Thirty
thousand
euros,
I
think,
Yeah,
check.
That
price
seems
way
high
to
me.
You
can't
buy
this
crap!
It
is
possible.
The
guy
wants
30
grand
Tell
me,
Driss,
-
It's
all
business,
I
guess.
It's
the
trace
Bullshit.
For
50
euros,
I'll
even
add
some
blue!
Enough.
Give
me
a
chocolate.
No.
Give
me
a
chocolate.
No
handy,
no
candy.
It's
a
joke.
I'm
kidding.

-
It's
a
joke?
-
A
joke.
A
very
good
joke.
That's
the
punch
line,
see.
But
in
your
case...
Come
on.
-
It's
wicked.
You
got
no
hands,
Philippe.
I'll
tell
it
to
Marge
Simpson.

I
was
wrong
about
the
price.
Ah,
voil√†.
It's
41,500
euros.
I'll
take
it.
You
will?

Hi,
Philippe.
You
summoned
me,
so
here
I
am.
I'm
listening.
What's
so
urgent?
I
didn't
summon
you.
You
must
have
some
idea
Who
is
this
fellow?
Everyone's
worried.
Yvonne
tells
me
He
hit
a
neighbor?
I
don't
need
to
tell
you
Don't
let
just
anyone
especially
not
in
your
state.
I'm
not
really
sure
Carry
on.
I
called
Sivot
The
boy
isn't
Al
Capone,
but
young
Driss
has
a
record.
He
just
did
six
months
for
robbery.
On
top
of
the
rest...
...I'm
told
he's
useless.
Be
careful.
These
street
guys
have
no
pity.

That's
it
exactly.
That's
what
I
want.
No
pity.
He
often
hands
me
the
phone
True,
he
isn't
compassionate.
But
he's
strong,
with
arms
and
legs.
His
brain
works,
he's
healthy.
So,
all
the
rest,
his
background
and
so
on,
As
you
wish.
Will
that
be
all?
Magalie...
-
Got
a
minute?
I
want
to
show
you
something.
What
is
it?
Chill,
you
can
always
say
no.

One
minute
then.
$0?
So
I
have
a
bathtub.
That's
all.
Very
interesting.
-
And...
There's
plenty
of
room.
I
have
bath
salts
and
foam.
OK.
Why
not?
Yeah.
Why
not?
Go
on
then,
get
undressed.
Look
at
you!
OK,
I'll
get
undressed.

What?
Where
are
you
going?
You
said
yes!
Just
a
quick
rinse!
What's
with
you?
I'm
always
tense

despair

continues
You
may
not
realize,
-
No,
I
didn't
realize.
Only
if
you
explain.
There's
nothing
to
explain.
He
writes
letters.
Letters?
Who
to?
Usually
to
women.
Come
on,
who?
One
in
particular.
El√©onore.
Who?
We've
never
seen
her.
How
come?
It's
an
epistolary
relationship.
Meaning
they
write
to
each
other.
No
need
to
spell
it
out.
The
blue
envelopes?
He's
hot
stuff.
He
epistles.
How
about
you?
No
lover
in
sight?
Albert
the
gardener,
say?
Certainly
not!
I've
seen
the
longing
looks
Am
I
wrong?
Yes
or
no?
Stop
it,
it's
ridiculous.
Has
he
slipped
it
to
you?
-
What?
What?
-
I
must
be
dreaming.
-
He
will
soon.
He
will
soon.




Shit!
-

-
Are
you
OK?
Want
some
music?


It's
all
right.
Calm
down.

Philippe.
Philippe.
Take
it
easy.
You're
with
me.
Take
it
easy.
-



It's
all
right.


I
need
air!
I
need
air!



Shit!

It's
good
to
breathe.
What
time
is
it?

I
don't
know.
Around
4:00
a.m.

It's
ages

What
happened?

The
medication
Doctors
call
them
phantom
pains.
I
feel
like
a
frozen
steak
I
feel
nothing
but
suffer
anyway.
Surely
something
could
help.
That
could.

We're
all
sick
for
that,
I
wanted
to
ask
you...
How
do
you
manage?
You
adapt.
So
can
you
do
it
or
not?
You
may
not
realize,
but
I
feel
nothing
So
you
can't.
It's
not
that
simple.
I
can,
but
it's
not
my
decision.
And
you
can
find
pleasure
elsewhere.
Yeah?
You've
no
idea.
You're
right.
How,
for
example?
For
example,
the
ears.
The
ears?
The
ears
are
a
highly
sensitive
You
get
your
ears
licked?
I'd
never
have
guessed.
-


-
Try
this.
It'll
help.
It
can't
hurt
you.
Drag
on
it.
Go
on,
drag
on
it.

Take
it
easy.
Share
it.

Again.
One
more
time.
That's
enough
for
now.
Sorry,
but
you
really
get
off
If
your
ears
are
red,
Exactly.
Sometimes
they're
hard
when
I
wake.
-
Both
of
them?
I
met
my
wife
Alice
She
was
tall,
very
elegant,
with
laughing
eyes.
Is
she
the
blond
in
the
photos?
She's
not
bad.
What
we
had
was
incredible.
I
hope
you
experience
that
one
day.
Fuck,
I
loved
her
so
much!
Then
she
got
pregnant.
Five
successive
miscarriages.
Then
the
verdict
came
in.
We
decided
to

Waiter!
Excuse
me!
Excuse
me!
Yes?
A
tarte
tatin,
please.
Cooked.
It
was
all
squashy
and
gooey.
That's
what
molten
cake
is.
-
So
that's
why.
I'll
have
a
tarte
tatin
anyway.
I've
always
loved
competition,
extreme
sports,
speed.
Going
faster,
higher.
A
paraglider
gave
me
that.
I
was
high
in
the
sky,
I
was
raised
to
think
Some
water.
My
mouth's
dry.
The
joint
does
that.
And
what
else?
Makes
you
hungry
But
bad
weather
can
be
fatal
And
you
flew
anyway?
Yes,
maybe
to
suffer
like
Alice.
I
broke
the
third
and
fourth
vertebrae.
When
the
pain
eases,
My
real
handicap
It's
living
without
her.
What
do
the
doctors
say?
With
the
advances
in
medicine,
with
massages
and
pick-me-ups.
It's
expensive,

I'd
have
shot
myself.
That's
not
easy
in
my
condition.
True.
That
sucks.

What's
the
date
today?
The
eighth
or
the
ninth.
It's
official
then.
What
is?
You've
won
your
bet.
Your
trial
period's
over.
I'm
hired
then?
Yes,
you're
hired.
Can
I
count
on
you
now?
-
Yes.
Start
by
giving
my
Faberg√©

back.

gave
me
one
each
year.
I
have
25,
one
for
each
year
I
cherish
it.
I
don't
know
why
you...
What
did
you
lose
again?


Mina!
Mina!
-
What's
up?
Buckle
up.
How's
it
going?
How's
school?
Why
don't
you
text
me
back?
I
was
busy.
Let's
hear
it.

cop,
to
talk
to
Mom.
and
said
we'd
go.
Found
my
999?
Have
you
found
it?
Screw
your
stone
egg.
What
did
you
say?
What
could
I
say?
I
only
had
30
grams
on
me.
For
that
you
get
a
spell
in
custody,
Let's
get
a
kebab.
I'm
not
getting
in
that!
Let
go
of
me.
Where
are
you
going?
Who's
driving
you?
Get
lost!
It's
not
your
business.
Piss
off!

don't
tell
her
about
it.
Stay
in
your
room
Time
for
bed?
I'll
stay
up
a
while
longer.
-
Sit
down.
Sit
down
here.
What
do
you
think
of
her?
-
She
looks
hot.
Let's
go
up.
I
imagine
her
standing
up,
turning
around
The
boy
looks
like
you.
That's
right.
I
spotted
him
earlier.
If
I
passed
him
on
the
street,
I'd
know
he
was
your
brother.
That's
funny.

Why?
He's
not
my
brother.
He
isn't?
It's
complicated.
Is
he
your
brother
or
not?
OK,
I
get
the
message.
Come
on,
let's
go.
My
parents...
...aren't
my
parents.
They're
my
uncle
and
aunt.
They
fetched
me
from
Senegal
They
couldn't
have
kids
They
picked
the
oldest.
Me.
My
name's
Bakary.
That's
my
real
name.
But
other
kids
had
that
name
and
that
became
Driss.
And
afterwards?
Out
of
the
blue,
got
pregnant
once
Then
my
uncle
died.
Other
men,
other
kids.
Like
I
said,
complicated.
Young
Adama...
He
came
to
get
you,
right?
Driss...
I
think
we'll
call
it
quits.
You
can't
be
pushing
an
invalid
After
all
your
hard
work,
Come
on,
let's
go.
Right.
Bassari
Bakary,
Bakary
Bassari.
It's
beautiful.
Almost
like
alliteration.

No.
-
Hello.
See
you
tomorrow.
OK.
Goodbye,
Yvonne.
-
You
got
my
sugar
puffs?
Thank
you.
-
Say
hi
to
Elisa.

Hey,
Bastien,
pal,
what's
up?
Come
here!

You're
leaving
then?
It's
OK,
I
have
your
number.
It
won't
be
easy,
but
be
strong.
Too
bad,
I'm
getting
your
room.
Maybe
I'll
stay
then.
It'll
be
a
bit
cramped.
Here.
-
Meet
Fr√©d√©rique.
Hey.
All
right.
What?
I
get
it.
So
that's
it.
You're...
Yes.
I
won't
kiss
you
goodbye
then.
I'm
not
against
a
threesome.
I'm
up
for
it.
But
I
can
come
back
tonight.
I
have
to
go
now.
I'm
kidding.

BYE,
guys.

Mr.
Michel
Sabourdi.
Keep
it
on,
channel
two.
You're
not
angry
about
Magalie?
No,
you
had
me
fooled.
I
couldn't
figure
out

A
goodbye
kiss?
All
right.
Yvonne.

Always
bullshitting
me.
See
you.

Just
a
second.
We
won't
be
needing
this.
OK,
bye.

Get
your
foot
off
there.
Which
bank?
Could
you
move
your
car,
please?
There's
a
sign.
I'll
move
it.
I'll
call
you
back.

Stop
busting
his
balls.
Matter
of
principle.
Wait
over
there
for
me.

What's
going
on?
I'm
coming.





I
can
cancel
my
date
if
you
want.
No,
certainly
not.
Why?
Go
out
and
have
fun.
-
OK,
Yvonne.
I'm
ready.
It's
all
ready.
If
there's
a
problem,
call
me.
You'll
call
me?
If
you
agree,
Take
the
coat
off.
All
right.
Got
a
cigarette?
No,
I
don't
smoke.
Well,
I
used
to.
I
gave
up
a
short
while
ago
it
would
be
bad
for
you,
even
if
you
don't
practice
a
sport,
...and
so
on.
You're
not
eating?







Watch
what
you're
doing!
-
I'm
so
sorry.
You
wanted
a
cranial
massage.
Hello,
sir.
Get
out.
-
Get
out!
Not
at
all.
He
got
up
in
a
bad
mood.
"He
got
up..."
-

-
Yes?

You
got
your
license
a
month
ago?
I'd
driven
before.
Mostly
on
private
roads,
tracks,
estates,
parking
lots.
I
read
your
application.
You
used
one
word
Yes.
That's
important.
There's
another
idea
here
Really?
Maybe
you
should
consider
-
That's
an
alexandrine.
May-be
you
should
con-si-der
read-ing
our
slo-gan.
-
It
wasn't
deliberate.
And
you
have
Dali's
melting
clocks
Maybe,
yes.
Do
you
like
art?
Yes.
-
I
like
Michelangelo.
But
I
prefer
the
other
Turtles.


Yes!
I'm
coming!
Just
a
second!
-

Get
the
hell
out.
Some
water?
A
compress?
Get
out.
'


Thanks,
Bruno.
Have
a
good
weekend.
See
you
on
Monday.
-
What's
wrong?
-
Where
is
he?
Hey,
what's
up,
bro?
What's
with
the
beard?

Serpico?
Jean
Jaur√©s?
A
metro
station
anyhow.
Victor
Hugo?
You've
let
yourself
go.
Good
thing
I'm
back.
I'll
be
right
in.


What
do
we
do
now?
You
let
me
handle
it
now.




Not
bad,
huh?



A
quick
cut
would
settle
it.
You're
in
great
shape.
I
love
it.

-
That's
hideous.
It's
hideous!
-
Horrible.
No.
Look!
Sleeveless
leather
vest,
spiked
bracelet,
Got
it!
Freddie
Mercury!
You
look
just
like
him!
That's
wicked.
Or
a
Cossack!
Come
on!
He's
crazy.
What
are
you
doing?
I
expect
the
worst.
No,
this
one's
good.
Look.
My
grandfather.
Really?

it
really
turns
me
on.
I'll
shave
it
all
off.
-
Thank
you.
No,
that's
not
funny.
No,
no,
no.
No.
Nein!
That's
what
you
mean.
No,
I
don't
agree.
Philippe,
very
angry.
-
I'm
just
your
plaything
now.
You'll
end
up
in
the
loony
bin.
Don't
you
feel
like
starting
a
war?
I
think
it's
time
-
You're
having
fun?
You
bet.
How
about
Nazi
invalids?
It
must
have
been
weird

You've
had
your
fun
now.



-
Hello,
sir.
Table
number
eight.
Follow
me,
please.
This
way.

Thank
you.
I'm
not
staying
for
lunch,
Philippe.
-
Why
not?
Actually,
you
have
a
date.
A
date?
What's
going
on?
Don't
panic.
It'll
be
fine.
By
the
...it
took
me
a
while,
Give
her
a
kiss
for
me.

Driss!
Driss!

What's
this
all
about?

Philippe.

Borgo
