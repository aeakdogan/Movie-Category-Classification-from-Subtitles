Hey,

Not

I
just

Oh.
I
can't
believe
I'll
make
sure
they
send
I'm
so
sorry.
Well,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
So

your
avocado?
It's
got
two
green
leaves
on
it.
Yippee!
I
told
you,
you
could
grow
something.
Well,
it
was
pretty
close.
I'm
not
kidding.
How's
your
day
going?
My
day?
My
day

Okay.
Sure.
No,

Hi,
Mr.
Moses!
Hi.

Did
you
start
that
new
book?
And,
what's
it
called?
It's
called
"Loves
savage
secret".
Oh,
my
God!
Is
it
any
good?
It's
terrible.
I
love
it.
It's
awful.
It's
about
this
fashion
designer
and
his
supermodel
girlfriend,
by
the
CIA
to
stop
an
assassination
Well,
who
doesn't
like
Milan

guess.
Anyway,
My
landlady
keeps
trying
to
set
me
up
She
just
told
me
she
thinks

I
try
not
to
judge.
What?
Shut
up!
I'm
not
gay.
So
here's
something
weird
...
I'm
actually
going
to
be
In
person?
Mmm-hmm.
Wow.
That
could
be
a
bad
idea.
It
could
be...
You
still
there?

Why
don't
you
call
me
Er...

I

Hey,
aren't
you
going
to
invite
me
in?
No,
I
don't
think
so.
But
I
bought
you
dinner!
Wow.
Wow!
Wow!
And
you
live
with
your
mother.
Awesome.
Yeah,
of
course.
You
have
no
job.
You,
mister,
are
not
getting
any
of
this.
Hey.
It's
me.
Frank.
The
avocado?
Why
are
you
here?
Get
out
of
my
house!
-
Hey!
I'm
not
going
to
hurt
you.
Would
you
just
listen
to
me?
Please?
Get
back.
Go
away.
Stay
away
from
me!
Is
that
my
bag?
Yeah.
You,
you
packed
it?
Yes.
Did
you
vacuum?
A
little,
yeah,
it
was
messy.
Get
back!
Get
out,

out.
Please,
you
have
to
leave
right
now

Help!
Help!

Someone
is
trying
to
kill
me.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Listen
to
me!
-
Help!
Why
would
anyone
want
to
kill
me?
Because
we've
been
under
surveillance.
They've
been
listening
Why?
Because
of
the
way
I
talk
to
you.
What?
They
know
I
like
you.

Listen
to
me.
Right
now.
Out
the
back
door.

No
way!
No!

Don't
get
me
wrong,
Don't
think
that
I
don't
think
this
is
crazy.
And
it...

...couldn't
be
more
different
than
how
But
you
know,
sometimes
And
I
just
hope
that
someday
...sitting
somewhere,
comfortably
...and
look
back
on
this



I'm
a
little
hungry,
too.

Pizza.

Listen
honey.
Yeah,
lots
of
boys
get
bullied
at
school.
I
know,
but
you
can't
solve
it
No,
I
don't
agree
with
you.
I
know,
it's
hard.
I'll,
I'll
talk
to
him
Mmm-hmm.

I
should
be

time
tonight.
Milk,

percent?
Okay,
love
you,
bye.
Listen.
I
can
make
you
rich.
Don't
you
know
who
I
am?
Of
course,
I
do.


This
is
off
the
books.
Total
blackout.
Yes,
ma'am.
There's
your
target.

Retired
analyst.
He
was
CIA.
Is
that
a
problem?
No.

The
spark
in
your
eye
sets

The
touch
of
your
hand,
woman

Sorry.

Wow.
If
you
let
me
go
now,
-
There's
no
hard
feelings.
How
do
I
always
attract
losers
like
you?
I
was
in
the
CIA.
Yeah,
I
bet
you
were.


I
have
to
go
see
someone
now...
You're
just
going
to
make
me
sit
here?
You
couldn't
be
safer.
Oh
no
you
don't,
don't
do
it.
-
Just
hold
still.
Sorry,
sorry,
sorry.
Your
eyes
are
so
beautiful.
Want
to
watch
TV?

Be
back
soon.
Is
that
thing
acting
up
again?
Oh
hi,
Marna.
Yeah
...I
Give
it
a
whack
will
ya?
Oh,
of
course.
I
don't
know
why
you
don't
Get
a
better
picture.
-
Try
a
little
bit
more
to
the
left.
Yeah...
That's
just
perfect.
Thank
you
very
much,
Marna.
Unbelievable.
Should
be
ashamed
of
yourself.

It's
nice
to
see
you,
kid.
It's
good
to
see
you,
too.
So
what's
up?
I
met
a
girl.
No...
Complicated.
Got
a
visit
from
a
wet
team.
At
my
house,
24
hours
ago.
Did
you
ID
any
of
them?
Kind
of.
This
used
to
be
a
gentleman's
game.
And
you
know
I
love
you.

You
know
her?
No.
Somebody

Yeah.
But
why
now?
I'm
retired.
We'll
just
have
to
dig
some
more.
Watch
your
back,
too.
I'm
80
years
old,
I
got

-
What
the
hell
can
they
do
to
me?
Well...
I
never
thought
this
would
happen
to
me.
What?
Getting
old.

I
mean,
Vietnam,
Afghanistan.

Rest
Home?

Go
figure.
So
Moses
made
22
calls
and
that
didn't
stand
out
to
you?
Unbelievable.
Hooray...
ha...
Have

the
girl
Mike,

plans.
She's
just
fine.
I
can
take
you
home.
Oh.
I
got
to
take
you
down
to
the
Then
there's
a
couple
of
federal
guys
I
got
to
say,
I
think
you're
and
keeping
it
together
like
you
did.
That's
impressive.
Um,
I'm
going
to
go
back
and
get
my
purse...
Well,
I
can
have
somebody
-
Get
in
the
car!
Let
me
go!
You're
hurting
me.


Am
I
going
to
die?
No.
You
just
need
some
sleep.
I
may
vomit.

I
am...
high.
You
have
such
beautiful
green
eyes.

Wow.
You
really
are
CIA.
Officer
down.
Suspect
is
a
white
male,
30s,
driving
a
black
Tahoe.



Freeze!
Put
your
weapon
on
the
ground
now!
Get
down,
down
right
now!

So
you're
saying
All
right,
Thelma,
thanks.
So
it's
like
that,
huh?
Yeah.
It's
like
that.
Where
are
we?
Ho...
How
did
we
get
to
New
York
City?
Wow,
I
really
hate
you
right
now.
I...I
was
just
hoping
you'd
be
a
little
I
was
hoping
not
to
get
kidnapped.
I
was
hoping
you'd
have
hair.
So
it
looks
like
none
of
our
dreams
I'm
sorry
about
that.
Thanks
for
saving
me.
I
guess.
No
problem.
Not
my
best
first
date.
Not
my
worst,
either.
Until
we
find
out
who's
trying
to
kill
us,
For
how
long?
I
don't
know.
Whoever's
trying
to
kill
us
She
used
to
live
in
Chinatown.

Okay.
Here
we
go.
Let's
get
in
-
You
just
hang
onto
this
tape.
No,
you
said
we
were
just
going
to
talk
to
her.
We
are.
I
know,
this
will
help.
-
The
woman
just
lost
her
daughter.
You
can't
just
go
around
People
are
basically
kind
of
decent.
That
hasn't
always
been
my
experience.
Let
me
try
and
talk
to
her.
-
What?

They
told
me
to
be
patient.
The
police
have
done
nothing.
They
said
it
was
just
a
burglary,
She
was
scared.
We're
hoping
we
can
do
more.
You
worked
with
my
Stephanie?
She
sent
me
this.
I
got
it
in
the
mail
on
the
day
she
died.
What
does
this
mean?
I
don't
know.
I
tried
dialing
the
numbers.
The
Police
have
no
idea.
Where
did
Stephanie
go
to
college?

Why
are
we
here
again?

Those
numbers
are
actually
a
call
number
for
a
book.
Call
numbers
start
with
letters.
In
the
Library
of
Congress,
yeah.
In
Harvard
Yenching,
it's
a
How
could
you
possibly
know
that?

You
speak
Chinese?
Unbelievable!

It's
a
hit
list.

Hank
Maestriano
died
2
weeks
ago.
Daniel
McGinty.
Heart
attack.
Last
week.

But
if
this
is
a
hit
list,
why
is
this
guy
still
alive?
Flies
cargo
planes.
That's
a
good
question.

Hell
of
a
mess.
Come
on
...

Joe
Matheson,
please.
Hold
on.
Marna.
Hello?
What?
Joe
...
CIA
headquarters,

Frank
Moses
was
never
a
target
analyst
This
guy
has
a
history.

That's
a
file
number.
You
need
to
visit
the
back
room.
You're
going
to
meet
the
Records
Keeper.
I
didn't
even
know
this
place
existed.
It
doesn't.
Ahh.
Frank
Moses'
file.
You
got
to
be
kidding
me.
Frank
Moses
was
one
of
the
most
effective
He
retired
drug
lords,
terrorists.
hell
he
...,
he
toppled
governments.
Yeah.
He
was
truly
gifted.
Why
was
he
retired?
He
got
old.
Then
some
thumb
sucker
came
along
Red?
Yeah.
RED.
you
know
R..E..D
Yeah...
Yeah.
Thanks.
I'm
going
to
need
a
data
haunt.
Every
flak
he
was
ever
involved
in.
I
want
NSA
telephone
surveillance,

We
have
to
find
Marvin
Boggs.
Marvin
died
two
years
ago
in
a
fire.
Yeah.
Marvin
has
died
many
times.
Oh,
can
we
have
that
one?
Wow.
All
we
need
is
a
banjo.

Shhh,
shhh.
Don't
make
any
sudden
moves.
Just
stay
close
to
me.
-
Don't
use
your
cell
phone.
Don't
talk
about
cell
phones.
Seriously?
Why
are
you
trying
to
kill
me?
I'm
not
trying
to
kill
you!
Oh,
yeah.
You
are.
Why
would
I
be
trying
to
kill
you?
Because
the
last
time
we
met,
That
was
a
long
time
ago.
Some
people
hold
on
to
things
like
that.
I'm
not
trying
to
kill
you.
Okay?
So
that
makes
us
friends.
Right?
Right.
Good.
You
want
to
take
that
knife
Who
is
she?
Sarah.
She's
not
trying
to
kill
you
either.
Yeah...
Hi.
I
don't
stay
in
the
open.
Come
on,
I'll
show
you
the
house.
What's
that?
Decoy.
He
lives
in
a
car?
Come
on
in.
Why
do
you
live
here
So,
Let's
put
it
this
way.
When
the
helicopter
passed
over
and
I
could
feel
their
eyes
on
me.
Wet
like
peaches.
I
have
a
list
here...
It
was
written
by
a
Herald
reporter
Along
with
everyone
whose
names
Well,
almost
everyone.
Frank,
how
many
times
have
I
told
you?
You
cannot
trust
the
system!
I
told
you
when
you're
in
the
system,
Man,
satellites,
cell
phones,
chips,
net,
the
web,
the
dentist...
Marvin!
That
list
is
the
one
we
need
help
with.
Yeah,
I
got
to
check
the
files.

Of
course
you
do.
Thanks,
man.
Wow.

This
guy's
insane.

Well,
he
thought
he
was
the
subject
of
This'll
take
a
minute.
Sure.
As
it
turns
out,
he
really
was
being
given
daily
doses
-
Well,
in
that
case,
he
looks
great.
Yeah.
Got
it.
Guatemala.
Fall
1981.
Five
of
the
guys
on
this
list
Uh,
San
Benito.
Just
outside.
Injun
territory.
Yeah.
It
was
a
little
village.
They
told
us,
"Go
in
there.
Clean
it
up"...
"Make
it
look
like
it
never
happened."
You
think
everyone
on
this
list
was
there?
Damn
it.
Damn
it!
Do
you
know
what's
wrong
They're
all
trying
to
kill
us?
Exactly!
Is
there
anybody
still
alive
on
that
list?
Gabriel
Singer.
Frank!
I
never
thought
I'd
say
this
again.
I
am
getting
the
pig!
Who's
she
talking
to?
Just
take
it
easy.

I
know
a
great
place,
just
up
the
road.
We're
not
getting
rid
of
the
broad.
I
like
her.
Okay?
What's
the
angle?
No
angle.
I
like
her.
Okay.
So,
they
pull
her
voice
probably
right
now,
install
the
recognition
software
So
then
we
show
up,
and
we're
fried
with
Y-rays.
How
you
doing?
Good,
fine.


Wow,
Singer
is
going
to
be
But
we
can
catch
him
at
the
How
about
that?

Sunset
Limited

Tucson
and
Los
Angeles
It's
the
final
boarding
call

No,
please!
No!
You
smell
like
Washington.
Who
do
you
work
for?
Coldwell
Banker,
I'm
a
real
estate
agent!
No,
no.
Who
do
you
work
for?
-
What?
Marvin!
Whoa!
Frank,
she's
one
of
them.
There's
a
camera
in
her
bag.
Wait
a
second,
please
don't
kill...

Marvin.
Look.
Marvin.
No
camera
in
the
bag.
Go,
ma'am,
now.
Now.
Get
a
car.
Try
not
to
kill
anyone.
She
was
following
us,
Frank.

Sorry.
"She
has
a
camera
in
her
purse,
Seriously?
See
you
in
a
minute.
Gabriel?
Right?
Gabriel
Singer?
What's
this
about?
Guatemala.
1981.
San
Benito.
I
can't
talk
to
you.
Pair
beats
ace.
I
got
one
for
you.
What
did
this
twice
decorated,
say
to
the
Chinese
I
give
up.
Nothing.
I
didn't
tell
her
a
damn
thing.
The
reporter's
dead
now.
And
everyone
she
spoke
to
is
And
that
includes
you.
Oh,
Christ.
They
had
me
fly
this
guy
out
there
Hairy
little
airstrip
in
He
was
CIA,
some
dorky
little
Remember
that
guy?
-
Black
glasses.

He
picked
up
a
package
What
was
the
package?
It
wasn't
a
what.
It
was
a
who.
Frank...
Frank,
FRANK!
It's
that
helicopter.
We're
in
an
airport.
So...
It's
the
same
helicopter.
November
Niner
748
Charlie.
November
niner
748
Charlie.
See?
Frank,
November
Niner
748...

Is
that
a
4?
This
is
a
4.
Charlie.
Is
that
a
7?
What
is
that?

I'll
tell
you
what
it
is.
-

I
told
you
she
shouldn't

We
lost
visual
on
target.
All
right.
Shake
the
tree.
-
You'll
pay
for
the
breakage?
That's
right,
old
man!
-
Old
man?
Can
I
kill
her
now?
She
called
me
an
old
man.
Pig!
Open
the
pig!
Okay,
head
down.
Grenade!

Damn
satellites!
Boop
to
that!
Yeah,
you
just
stay
right
there.
This
is
going
to
be
good.

You
okay?
Come
on,
come
on.
Hey.
All
right?
What
are
you
doing?
Old
man,
my
ass.
God
damn
it!
-
Smoke
and
thermals.
Obstructed
view.
Nice
shot.
-
Thanks.

You
really
know
how
to
show
a
girl
I
will
kill
you,
Marvin.
Take
it
easy,
man.
She
likes
you.

How
can
you
tell?
Notice
how
she
sticks
around?
Because
if
a
woman
don't
like
you,
She
doesn't
really
have
Sure
she
does.
Really?
You
think
so?
You
know,
if
it
is
the
CIA,
Then
there
is
only
one
to
find
out
why
they're
coming
after
us.
Yeah.
We're
going
to
get
killed
there,
for
sure.
In
or
out?
No,
of
course
I'm
in,
it's
just
We're
going
to
need
some
serious
help.
This
is
not
the
kind
of
help
I
meant,
Frank.
You're
not
actually
going
to
go
in
there,
I
don't
think
I
can
go,
Frank.
The
last
time
they
put
in
some
not
very
nice
places.
Listen,
hang
onto
that
for
me.
I'll
be
right
back.

Hey.
Be
careful.
Tell
Ivan
Simanov
that
Frank
Moses
is...
Frank
Moses
is
here
to
see
him.

I
have
to
say
this
is
the
last
thing
I
expected
when
I
got
up
this
morning.
I
have
many
times
dreamed
of
killing
you.
But
now
...
you
are
...
a
pensioner...
Couple
of
years
now.
Time
passes.
As
we
get
older,
Still
...
I
owe
you
for
killing
Igor.
-
Igor
the
Butcher?
-
He
was
a
pig.

To
Igor.
The
Butcher.
He's
not
dead.
I
flipped
him.
No
...
He
owns
a
string
of
7-Elevens

He
weighs
500
pounds.



Drink.
Who
are
we
drinking
to
now?
Veronique.
She
was
mine.
-
Impossible.
Whatever
she
got,
it
was
worth
it.

I
miss
the
old
days.
I
haven't
killed
anyone
in
years.
That's
sad.
But,
I
think
you
are
not
here
for
the
vodka.
I'm
going
to
break
into
the
CIA.
I
need
your
complete
Cracks,
Codes,
ID
swipes
...

Amusing
as
this
would
be,
it
is
beyond
my
reach.

A
favor
from
Frank
Moses?
I
can't
believe
you're
actually
The
badges
Ivan
gave
us
and
a
female
nuclear
physicist
Sheniqua
Johnson?
You're
adopted.
Okay.



-
What?
-
I
dropped
it.

Freeze!

The
General
has
dropped
his
contact
lens.
Perhaps
you'd
like
to
help
us.
Sorry.
Found
it!
I
found
it!
I
found
it.

Have
a
good
day,
sir.
Gentlemen.

Oh
my
God!
What
do
you
suppose
the
punishment
Death.
Maybe
life
in
prison.
Awesome.



The
Russians
give
you
the
code?
No.
Changes
every
six
hours.
Will
you
hold
that
for
me
for
a
second?
Yeah.
It's
unbreakable.
Wow.
Come
on.
Mr.
Moses.
It's
been
a
long
time.
I'm
going
to
need
to
see
that,
Guatemala?
-
Yes.
I
think
I
can
help
you.

Great.
You
know,
It's
been
a
whole
new
world

You
know,
you're
going
to
After
what
I've
seen?
Oh,
I
should
tell
you
...
there's
a
new
guy
came
down
here
Name
of
William
Cooper?
6'1"?
Cute
hair?
Hair
was
cute.

But
I
thought
he
looked
a
little
tough,
You
take
good
care
of
yourself,
Henry.
You,
too,
Mr.
Moses.
Change
of
plan.

Bad
move,
Grandpa.

I'm
back
in
the
saddle
again

Son
of
a
bitch!
Seal
the
building.
Bald,
white
male,
50s,
wearing
white
shirt,
blue
pants,
Hi.

We
should
go.
We
should
go
now.

Shut
off
the
alarm.
-
We
need
to
evacuate.
You
make
sure
everyone
gets
checked.
Help,
help!
Please
come!
I
can't
stop
the
bleeding.
You
okay,
sir?

Make
a
hole!
Make
a
hole!
Whoa!
Hold
it.
Let
me
see
him.
It's
not
him.
Yeah,
yeah.
Go
ahead.

Fellas,
help
me
out,
here.
Marvin?
There's
still
something
wrong


You're
really
something,
Joe.
Marvin,
you
okay?
I
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
Joe?
Joe
who
was
dead
Joe?
-
She
with
us?
Not
dead.
Just
retired.
I
guess
calling
wasn't
an
option,
huh?
-
Can
we
go?

You
let
yourself
get
shot?
God
damn
it.


Out.
-
You
okay?
What
did
he
get?
I
have
no
idea.
You
just
had
your
ass
handed
What
did
he
do?
What
did
Moses
do
to
earn
a
lethal
finding?
I
have
not
been
read
into
it.
I
like
you,
Cooper.
but
someone
just
kicked
in
so
you
better
get
your
shit
straight.
Nothing
in
your
mission
is
changed.
-
You're
still
bleeding.
Must
have
nicked
something
in
there.
This
is
so
bad.
It's
not
that
bad.
No,
they
don't,
they
get
paper
cuts.
I
mostly
get
shot.
Well
we're
going
to
have
to
find
Could
go
to
Eagle's
Nest.
Huh?
Then
we
all
get
shot.
I'll
just
go
in
by
myself.
Want
a
vest?

Wouldn't
do
any
good.
Frank
Moses.
Hi,
Victoria.
Are
you
here
to
kill
me?
No.
You've
been
shot.
Tell
Marvin
to
stand
down
Who's
the
girl?

She's
with
me.
-
Vicky.
Oh,
Vicky.
Sexy
as
ever.
Oh
you
old,
snake
charmer
you.
Sarah,
this
is
Victoria.
And
a
true
artist
with
an
RPM.
What's
that?
I
kill
people,
dear.
You
were
lucky.
How'd
you
do
it?
-
What?
Here
you
seem
so
calm.
At
ease.
I
love
it.
I
love
it
here.
I
love
the
baking...
I
like
the
routine.
Well
I...
-
I
do
get
a
bit
restless
sometimes.
I
take
the
odd
contract
on
the
side.
I...
I
just
can't
stop.
Yeah.
Tell
me
about
it.
You
can't
just
flip
a
switch
Put
some
pressure
on
it.
So...
Tell
me
about
your
lady
friend.
Makes
me
think
that
I
could
actually
...have
a
life.
A
real
life.
Oh,
Francis,
you're
such
a
romantic.
What?
A
romantic.
Victoria...
You're
all
hard
on
the
outside,
You
are
gooey
on
the
inside.
Gooey.
The
entire
back
half
of
the
Guatemala
file
But
there's
a
list.
11
names.
All
dead.
Except
for
Frank
and
Marvin.
All
the
names
on
the
reporter's
list
but
she
has
an
additional
name.
Alexander
Dunning.
Somebody's
protecting
him.
Dunning
is
the
CEO
of
Browning-Orvis.
Gangsters.

Defense
contractor.
Very
connected.
You
know,
if
the
CIA
is
protecting
him,
he's
under
surveillance.
We
could
go
see
him.
You're
not
going
without
me.

Well...
We're
getting
the
band
back
together.

Yeah?
We
just
got
a
tip.
RED
has
a
new
target.
A
tip?
FBI's
on
the
scene.
I'm
on
my
way.

The
FBI
has
a
lookout

Copy
that.

Alexander
Dunning.
Pleasure
to
see
you,
Secretary
Baptiste.

They're
in.
Frank
said
you
wanted
me
with
you.
Yes,
I
thought
it
might
be
nice
You
know,
get
to
know
each
other.
And
I
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
I've
never
seen
him
like
this.
So
if
you
break
his
heart,
I
will
kill
you.
And
bury
your
body
in
the
woods.
Wow.
Okay.
Oh,
this
is
going
to
be
fun.

we
have
a
longstanding
commitment
because
exemplary
corporate
citizenship
As
a
company
with
global
reach
we
have
global
responsibilities.
Now
sometimes
I'm
asked,
if
this
commitment
to
ethical
behavior
And
my
answer
is
always
the
same.
Yes.
It
makes
it
stronger.
This
is
my
safe
room.
Swept
for
bugs
daily.
You
could
fire
a
gun
in
here.
No
one
would
ever
know.
Mr.
Dunning.
I
cannot
imagine
a
more
perfect
place
You
do
know
that
there's
a
surcharge
for
any
arms
deliveries
to
countries
that
are
embargoed
For
every
problem,
monsieur,
there
is
a
solution.

Excuse
me.
Mmm-hmm.
What
are...

So
how
did
you
guys
meet?
We
started
talking
on
the
phone.
I
guess
I
liked
that
it
wasn't
real.
Of
course
now
I'm
a
fugitive,
the
CIA
wants
to
kill
me
You
know,
I
was
in
love
with
an
agent
once.
What
happened?
Well
I
was
with
MI6,
and
the
relationship
wasn't
sanctioned.
So
when
it
came
to
light,
And
I
was
ordered
to
kill
him.
It
was
a
test.
What
did
you
do?
I
put
three
bullets
in
his
chest.
Okay.
Who
the
hell
are
you
guys?
You
don't
remember
us?
We
remember
you.
You're
the
guy
whose
shit
we
cleaned
up
And
the
question
is,
You
don't
have
any
idea
First
of
all,
you
can't
touch
me.
Sure,
we
can.

Oh,
yeah.
Where'd
you
get
this?
Home
Depot.
-
How
much?
You
want
nuts?
Nipples?
Potty
trainer?
All
right,
stop
it.
Nuts.
Stop
it.
For
the
love
of
Christ,
stop
it!
Stop
already!
Now
you
got
something
to
say?
We
extracted
a
young
lieutenant
who
is
the
son
of
the
late
Senator,
James
Stanton.
Robert
Stanton?
Vice
President
of
the
United
States.
You're
saying
the
Vice
President
Yeah.
Went
completely
off
the
reservation.
And
that
New
York
Times
reporter?
Did
she
pressure
you?
Yeah.
She
called
me.
Twice.
So
I
called
the
V.P.
And
what
did
you
think
Oh,
whatever.
I
made
him
Vice
President.
You
kept
your
mouth
shut

our
partners
in
the
developing
world
to
root
out
corruption
and...

Okay.
I
will
pay
whatever
it
costs
to
get
rid
of
this
thing.

We're
not
here
for
your
money,
home.
We're
here
because
that
New
York
Times
of
everybody
who
was
in
Guatemala.
And
everybody
on
that
list
Except
you.
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
Don't
you
see?
He's
trying
to
clean
up
his
past
He's
trying
to
cut
me
loose

We
have
some
Looks
like
we're
blown.
We're
in
position.
They're
moving
a
team
up
the
east
side.
Are
you
going
to
let
me
talk
to
them?
-

Thanks,
when
we
want
your
help,
Listen,
Plastic
Man,
those
bastards
out
there
I
hope
so.
Why?
'Cause
I'm
a
bad
guy?
I'm
scum?
Can
I
just
shoot
him
now?
No.
You
don't
have
people
killed.
I
have
people
killed,

Not
worth
a
bullet.

Hello?
How's
retirement,
Frank?
It's
been
a
real
blast.
If
we
have
to
come
in
there
and
get
you,
You
bet.
Real
messy.
I've
got
my
orders,
Frank.
They
come
from
the
Vice
President.
He's
ordered
these
hits
to
cover
up
Well
I
find
that
hard
to
believe.
How
did
you
know
you'd
find
me
here?
Some
anonymous
untraceable
tip?
Here's
the
deal,
Frank.
You're
going
to
walk
out
that
front
door
You
have
my
word
no
one
I'll
personally
take
you
in
and
you
will
You
got
60
seconds
to
decide.
What's
it
look
like?

There's
no
clean
exit...
....
They
seem
to
be
coming
from
everywhere.
If
we
had
a
distraction,

Looks
like
there's
not
a
lot
I
mean
somebody's
going
to
have
to
make
if
we
are
going
to
get
out
of
here
alive.
Been
wild.
Wild
and
crazy.
But
I
wouldn't
want
it
any
other
way.
An
honor.
Good
luck.


Tell
your
men
to
hold
their
fire.
I'm
coming
out.
He's
coming
out.
All
units,
hold
fire.
Repeat,
all
units,
hold
fire.

Roger
that.
Get
behind.
Come
out
now.

Who
fired
the
shot?
Tell
me
when
the
boys
Now.


They've
got
Sarah.
Frank,
you're
no
good
to
her
dead.
We
got
to
move.
Come!
Now
is
not
time
to
waste.
Ivan?

It's
nice
to
see
you
again,
Ivan.
Did
he
just
call
you
"bunny"?
Life
sometimes
is
complicated.

To
Joe.

To
Joe.
Not
to
push
the
bounds
of
propriety,
but
don't
you
think
the
CIA's
being
used
by
the
Vice
and
that
they'll
do
whatever
they
can
Options?
We
could
go
public.
Yeah,
right.
That
didn't
work
And
what
about
Frank's
girlfriend?
They'll
kill
her
so
fast.
First
they'll
interrogate
her.
Then
give
her
a
little
snorkel.
-
Bring
in
the
dent.
God!
You
are
such
an
idiot.

I
want
to
show
you
something.
This
was
done
to
me
by
It
seems
that
what
we
had
But
now
she
sits
outside
my
house
...
...drinking
vodka.
Three
bullets
in
the
chest.
When
I
woke
alive,
I
knew
she
still
loved
me.
Or
else
it
would
have
been
the
head.
It
was
big
risk
for
her,
of
course,
but
one
does
crazy
things
for
love.
Do
not
fear
for
your
love,
my
friend.
With
a
small
dedicated
group,
there
is
nothing
Let
me
be
blunt.
Nobody
knows
you're
here.
You
don't
exist.
And
unless
you
cooperate
fully,
there's
nothing
I
can't
do
to
you.
-
Sir.
Moses
is
on
the
phone.
Okay.
Trace
is
running.
Moses.
Here's
the
thing,
Cooper.
With
age
comes
a
certain
perspective.
I'd
be
a
liar
if
I
said
there
wasn't
a
time
Blind
ambition.
Misplaced
trust.
Why
are
you
telling
me
this?

It
might
help
me
to
decide

Just
keep
it
going.
Why?
What
are
you
thinking
about?
Our
business
is
a
very
hard
one.
But
it
was
never
the
killing
or
the
stress,
or
the
bad
pay
that
bothered
me.
What
was
it,
Frank?
It's
how
anything
that
you
love
can
be
taken
away
from
you.

Never
to
invest.
Then
I
met
this
woman.
Sarah.
And
now
you
have
her.
Now
I
can't
think
of
anything
than
to
know
that
your
enemies
The
feeling
is
almost
indescribable.
You
still
there,
Cooper?
You're
at
my
house.
Almost
indescribable,
isn't
it?
Please
...
Please
don't
hurt
my
family.
If
anything
happens
to
Sarah,
I
will
rip
everything
you
love
And
then
I'll
kill
you.
I
swear
to
you,
I
will
keep
Sarah
safe.
We
don't
have
much
time.
Do
you
understand
that?
What
are
you
going
to
do,
Frank?
I'm
going
to
kill
the
Vice
President.
What
are
you
going
to
do?

Move!
Move!

Mom!
Frank
left
this
for
me.
Where
did
he
get
it
from?
The
secure
records
depository
of
the
CIA.
Look,
Sarah
...
I
know
Frank's
been
right
But
he's
about
to
cross
a
line
Right
now,
You
need
to
tell
me
Because
if
I
can't
stop
him,
I'm
going
to
have
to
kill
him.
Do
you
know
who
Frank
Moses
is?
Do
you
know
what
he's
done?
Wow.
You're
asking
me
for
help?
He's
going
to
eat
you
for
lunch.
She's
never
going
to
trust
us.
I
can't
blame
her.
The
tip
off
was
a
trap.
Someone's
got
us
dancing
like
marionettes.
Just
like
Moses
called
it.
Yeah.
He
will
take
a
shot
at
the
V.P.
That's
a
problem
for
the
Secret
Service.

Moses
will
take
them
apart.
Plug
me
into
their
detail.
You
got
it.
What
about
her?
I'll
keep
her
close.
Protected.
Off
the
grid.

I
put
a
few
things
away.
Just
in
case,
you
know.
Frank
...
Swedish
K.
Now
that
is
exciting.
Explosives?
Just
past
the
RPGs.
I
love
you,
man.
-
Make
yourself
at
home.

Nice
to
see
you,
too.

Thank
you.

Oh.
I'm
sorry.
Sorry.
Silly.
Thank
you,
ma'am.
-
Thank
you
very
much.
Welcome,
Ms.
Brown.
Mmm-hmm.
It's
a
pleasure
to
have
you
Oh,
I'm
so
looking
forward
to
it.
Raptor
is
cleared
for
entry.
After
you,
Mr.
Vice
President.

A
true
war
hero,
And
so
it's
with
great
pleasure
vice
President
Robert
Stanton.


I
love
you,
sir!
Thank
you,
everybody.
I'm
going
to
keep
this
short
and
sweet
so
you'll
actually
write
those
checks

Seriously,
though,
great
to
see
you
all.

It's
the
wonderful
people
here
tonight
that
got
us
into
the
White
House
And
I
believe
who
will
keep
us
there

My
good
friends,
I
am
proud
to
announce
that
I
will
with
the
primary
goal
of
seeking

We've
had
a
great
journey
together.
But
I

Mmm?
Hello,

Moves
like
that
could
get
you
killed.
Your
radiance
tonight
Almost.
What
are
you
grinning
at?
I've
always
dreamed
Vice
President.
Hmm,
whatever.
Having
you
in
my
arms
once
again,
Really?
Tell
me
you
love
me.
It's
been
a
long
time,
Ivan.
Blink
of
an
eye.

Ivan.
The
music
has
stopped.
Has
it?
Ah.
To
work
then.
Ivan!
Do
you
smell
that?
-
This
area
is
off
limits.
You'll
have
to
turn
around.
No,
no,
no,
no
it's
fine.
It's
all
right.
I'm
sure
I'm
allowed.
You'll
have
to
go
back
up,
ma'am,
Where
exactly
is
the
threat?
-
Good
to
see
you.

Oh,

God!
Gas!

using?
Get

Move
to

you.

We

Outside!

Okay?
Marvin.
Bugger!

Almost
there.
We
got
to

You're
on
your
own.
I'm
no

Good
luck.
Go

Let's

Are
you
hit,
sir?
-
Are
you
hit?

Perhaps
I
could
be
of
assistance?

I
love
you.
I
know.
Freeze!

Burbacher!
Pull

Who
are
you?
One
of
the
men
you
ordered
killed.
I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
Guatemala.
I
was
there.
Well...
I'm
sure
we
can
negotiate
something.
Starting
to
come
back
to
you
now,
is
it?
If
you're
looking
for
revenge...
This
is
not
about
revenge.
Are
you
going
to
kill
me?
Not
just
you.

Yeah?
I'm
at
the
Evanston
power
plant.
You
have
15
minutes
to
bring
me
Sarah.

Or
I
kill
the
vice
President.
He
just
made
contact.
He
wants
the
girl.
Evanston
power
station,
15
minutes.
You
better
alert
Secret
Service.

Copy
that.
Secret
Service
is
en
route.

All
right,
come
on.
Where's
Sarah?

She's
on
her
way.


It's
over,
Frank.
Any
minute
We'll
see.

Hey,
tough
guy.
Surprised
to
see
me?
What
the
hell
is
this
Alex...
Just
give
him
what
he
wants.
You
ordered
these
killings,
not
me.
I
don't
want
to
have

You
shot
me.
Shut
up.
I
loved
watching
you
being
a
good
guy.
Kicking
ass
for
your
country.
It
showed
a
spectacular
lack
of
vision.
The
girl
goes
free.
That'll
cost
you
a
gun.
A
life
for
a
life.
I
tore
up
all
those
checks.
I
know.
I
just
wanted
to
talk
to
you.
Cooper,
cuff
him.
Wilkes
told
me
you
had
promise.
Okay,
here's
how
it
goes.
Moses
just
shot
the
V.P.
You
kill
him
and
the
girl,
and
you're
head
of
the
CIA.

Cooper.
This
is
going
to
happen
either
way.
Fuck
you,
Cynthia.

Thanks.
This
going
to
be
a
problem?
No.
I
got
it...
...Grandpa.

Feel
better
now?
Yeah.
Want
to
get
pancakes?
Can
you
believe
it?
It
all
worked
out.
Something
bad
is
going
to
happen
very
soon.
Maybe
not.
Wait
a
second
...
Nobody's
chasing
us.
No
one's
trying
to
kill
us.
I
think
we
just
got
our
lives
back.
Almost.
You
still
owe
me
a
small
favor.
Oh,
Ivan!
His
timing
is
terrible.
You
gave
a
favor
to
him?
Just
a
tiny
little
nuclear
problem
Can
we
go?
Yes.
We
can
go.
I
told
you
something
bad
was
Keep
your
skirt
on
Goldie
locks.
Moldova
sucks.
Moldova
sucks!

time,
