You

Want
to

You
okay?
You
seem
a
little
off.
Yeah,
I'm
just
trying
to
think
about
CAL:
Why
don't
we
just
say
it
at
the
same
time?
-
I
want
a
divorce.


-
You
can't
get
away.

It's
okay,
that's
my
fault.
Come
on,
let's
get
you
to

No

maniac.
Go
brush

Aren't
you
gonna
say
anything?
Almost
25
years
of

Robbie.
Hey,
Robbie,
have
you
seen
ROBBIE:
Get
out.
ROBBIE:
Close
the
door.
Okay,
Robbie,
I'm
really
sorry,

You're
not
talking,
and
you
know
But
maybe
that's
good,
you
know?
Maybe...
Maybe
I'll
just
tell
you
David
Lindhagen.
From
work.
-
You
met
him
at
the
Christmas
party.
The
last
person
in
the
world
If
you
keep
talking,
I'm
gonna
get
out.
I
think
the
fact
that
I
did
it,
-
Okay.
Oh,
my
God!
Cal!
Are
you
okay?
I'll
leave
tonight.
I'll
sign
whatever
you
want.
Okay.

ROBBIE
:
No,
you
know,
I
should
have
knocked.

Just
for
the
record,
-
Robbie.
...and
I
look
at
it
the
whole
time.
I
love
you,
Jessica.
I
am
actually
begging
you
to
stop
it.
And
I
know
you're
17,
...which
is
the
same
age
But
soon
our
age
difference
Which
is
good,
because
I'm
pretty
sure
Okay,

Listen,
Robbie...

Shit.
Hey,
Mr.

Mrs.
Weaver,
how
was...?
Oh,
my

Uh,
what
happened?
Mrs.
Weaver
said
she
wanted
a
divorce,
-
Cal.
Honey...
-
Kids
good?
Everybody
good?
EMILY:
Oh.
-
You're
getting
a
divorce?
Uh,
so,
Jess,
Yeah,
yeah,
she's...
-
You
jumped
out
of
a
moving
car?
EMILY:
Did
she
fight
you
on
broccoli?
She
always
fights
me.
-
Sorry
you
had
to
find
out
this
way.
-
I'm
sorry
if
she
fought
you.
I
don't
have
any
money.
Uh,
sweetheart?
Let's
go
to
bed,
okay?
Listen,
why
don't
you
grab
your
coat?
I
don't
care.
I
love

I
really
do.
And,
given
the
opportunity...
Yes,
I
would
have
his
babies.
Seriously?

yes.

Hi.

That's
weird,
I
think
that

Oh,

not
just

She

Tsk.
You

Sure.
Proceed.

You're
never
gonna

in

But
I
can't

That

Okay.

That's

like
Ms.

But
if
she
wants
to

you...
...then
I
think
she's
batshit
crazy.
Mm.

Sorry.
I
hope
this
doesn't

I've
developed,

Okay.
So
Molly,
who's
6
at
the
time,
We're
looking
all
over.
It's
in
the
kitchen.
Wanna
get
out
of
here?
Have
a
good
night.

Let's
get
out
of
here.

Let's
get

Let's
get
out
of
here.

Let's
get
out
of
here.
-
Let's
get
out
of
here.
Shit.

-
You
have
a
second?
DAVID:
You've
been
avoiding
me.
You
ran
in
the
other
direction
when
you
-
You're
very
fast,
by
the
way.
That
must
be
it.
Hey,
listen,
I'm
sorry
-
No,
you're
not.
I
like
you,
Emily.
Do
you
have
any
idea
Hey,
David,
you
know,
I
had
no
intention
of
falling
...but
all
of
a
sudden
we're
having
...who's
waking
up
every
morning
And
that
just
does
not
happen
I
checked
with
other
accountants.
David,
you
know
what?
You
noticed
last
month
when
I
got
But
look,
trust
me.
You
know...
I
am
saving
you
from
disaster,
because
Do
you
really
want
any
part
of
this?
Do
I
really
want
any
part
of
this?

-
Emily?
Your
report's
ready.
TEACHER:
The
Scarlet
Letter
A

the
1600s.

TEACHER:

upon
himself
Mr.
Weaver.
Mr.
Weaver.
Are
we
interrupting?
You
wanna
talk
about
All
right.
Well,
the
A
they're
both
wearing...
...I
think
it
stands
for
"asshole."
Wanna
know
why?
Because
they
fell
in
love...
...and
love
is
for
stupid
assholes.
And
this
book
is
just
about
...who
fell
in
love,
like
assholes...
...then
had
to
die,
like
assholes.
I'm
sorry
about
all
the
"assholes."
You
know
what
else
might
work?
You
know,
a
quarter
per
curse
word.
EMILY:
All
right.
Could
help.
-
Take
care.
-
Seriously?
Hey,
I
have
to
go
back
to
the
office.
ROBBIE:
They're
still
making
kids
read
Yep.
You'd
think
somebody
would
have
I
guess
I
should
take
that
down,
huh?
I
guess.
So
how
is
he?
You
know.
I
mean,
l...
-
Forget
I
ever...
-
A
lot?
Like...
Like
"a
lot"
a
lot,
A
lot.
Well,
that's
good.
That's
really
good.
-
Wanna
get
takeout
tonight,
honey?
I
can
tell
that
he's
sad.
...I
can
still
tell
that
he's
not
happy,
Yeah.
Well,
you
know.
Yeah.
I
guess
I'm
pretty
sad
too.
I
know.
I
heard
you
crying
the
other
night.
Didn't
know
what
to
do.
Oh,
Robbie,
baby,
you're
13,
I
tried
Googling
it.
-
You
did
not.
-
Well,
what
did
you
Google?
What
did
Google
say?
Just
a
bunch
of
weird
videos
Ugh.
Oh,
God.
Okay.

Do
those
parental
controls
work
at
all?
They
work
for
me.
Because
you're
a
disgusting
teenager,

DAVID:
Hey.
-
Bill
wants
to
see
you
before
you
take
off.
Robbie,
this
is
David.
-
Um,
we
work
together.
-
You
all
right
to
wait
a
little
bit?
EMILY:
So,
Robbie,
I
hear
So,
David,
I
hear
-
You
are
David
Lindhagen,
right?
-
Yeah.
Here's
the
thing,
Lindhagen.
Whatever.
In
the
end,
she
winds
up
He's
a
better
guy
than
you
are
And
she
still
loves
him.
...like
I'm
not
gonna
stop
...that
make
her
feel
uncomfortable.
Hey.
You
ready
to
go,
honey?
-
Can
we
order
Chinese
for
dinner
tonight?
Hi,
David.
Get
your
stuff.
-
Bye,
David.
You're
not
gonna
be
able
I'll
be
fine.
Jesus
Christ.
JACOB:
The
war
between
the
sexes
is
over,
We
won
the
second
women
started
doing
But
even
though
we
won,
Make
them
feel
beautiful,
listen
to
Would
you
put
on
some
clothes,
please?
-
I'm
sorry,
is
this
bothering
you?
My
schwantz
is
in
your
face.
-
Okay,
it
bothers
me.
You
gotta
take
control
You
want
something,
you
take
it.
You
don't
like
something,
you
say
it.
David
Lindhagen
certainly
took
And
I
can
guarantee
you
this:
He
is
opening
the
car
door
What,
you
passing
out?
Oh,
boy.

-
I
think
you're
ready,
pal.
To
talk
to
a
pretty
lady,
No.
No,
I'm
not.
You're
ready
as
you're
ever
gonna
be.
You
play
your
strengths,
pal.
I'm
mysterious.
I'm,
you
know,
good
in
bed.
And
you
are
a,
uh...
...you
know,
stable
and
employed
adult.
Jesus.
You
see
this
lady
over
here
at
9
o'clock?
CAL:
No,
I
wanna
hit
on
her.
CAL:
JACOB:
She's
a
fox,
right?
You
think
she
came
to
a
crowded
bar
She's
just
looking
for
an
opportunity
And
I'd
like
her
to
settle
for
you.
Oh.
Well,
thank
you
for
the
ego
boost,
Just
because
I've
watched
you
...doesn't
mean
I
know
how
-
Ever
see
Karate
Kid?
When
he's
teaching
him
to
wax
on
and
off
You
want
me
to
fight
someone?
What's
the
first
thing
I
do
Yes,
always.
Without
fail.
Even
if
she
doesn't
want
one,
-
And
do
I
talk
about
myself?
Never
about
yourself,
always
her.
-
Because
bar
banter...?
So
you
put
the
impetus
on
her.
"Impress
me.
It's
a
big
game.
Game.
-
That's
judgmental,
isn't
it?
At
the
end
of
the
night
No,
you
tell
them
to
come
home.
It
is
your
choice
and
they
are
so
overjoyed
...to
make
sweet,
sweet
love
to
you.
Oh,
my
God.
You
did,
you
Miyagi'd
me.
Honk.
Take
your
ring
off.
Let's
go.
Just
no
talking
about
your
kids,
your
job,
Shut
up,
shut
up.
Just
shut
up.
-
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
-
Who
are
you?
-
Kate,
you
mind
if
I
introduce
you
to
my...?
-
I
got
this.
Pleased
to
meet
you.
And
this
is
my
friend
Jacob.
-
Oh.
So
that's
one
way
to
treat
people.
So
can
I
buy
you
a
drink,
Kate?
-
Oh.
No,
thank
you.
Grey
Goose,
right?
Rocks.
Two
limes?
I'm
five
years
sober.
-
What
can
I
get
for
you?
Go
away,
we're
good.
-
Ahem.
So,
what
do
you
do,
Cal?
-
I
asked
you
first.

Seriously,
what
do
you
do?
Seriously,
what
do
you
do?
Are
you
really
not
going
to
tell
me
Ah...
-
Uh,
okay,
I'm
a
teacher.
Come
on,
you
gotta
keep
it
interesting.
Uh...
-
I
studied
at
Oxford
for
five
years.
Wow.
Teacher
with
an
alcohol
dependency
Blah,
blah,
blah.
Bleh.
England.
Yuck.
I
think
my
friends
just
got
here.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry.
-
Okay,
I'm
in
corporate
insurance.
I
have
children,
plural.
My
wife
was
cheating
on
me
...which
I
wasn't
supposed
to
tell
you.
-
What
were
you
supposed
to
tell
me?
I
was
supposed
to
say
that
you
are
the
...which
is
actually
something
But
now
it's
become
corrupted.
And
I
have
18
layers
of
clothes
on.
I'm
wearing
a
shirt
and
a
tie
...that
just
seals
in
all
the
heat.
Seals
in
all
the
juices.
It's
all
sweat
under
here.
This
sweater,
this
is
called
slim
cut,
And
I'm
looking
at
your
breasts.
You
think
I'm
the
perfect
combination
That's
what
you
picked
up
Mm,
mm.

-
So
this
is
my
crappy
apartment.
Dumpy.
That
I
had
to
move
into
I
love
how
you're
being
so
honest.
-
You
like
that?
Okay.
Okay.
KATE:
Aah!
Ha,
ha.
-
More.
CAL:
Wanna
hear
something
really
hot?
I've
only
had
sex
with
one
woman.
-
Honest
or
not
honest?

More!
Tell
me
more.
I'm
a
little
worried
you
have
AIDS.
Just
a
little.
Just
a
little
bit.
It's
okay,
I'm
not
worried.

Oh,
my
God,
this
is
so
much
fun.
What
do
you
wanna
do
with
me?
Oh...
I
wanna
show
you
off
to
my
ex-wife


CAL:
Phew.
Ha,
ha.
You
gonna
call
me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Wow,
that
is
a
great
dress.
Thank
you.
A

Beverly
Hills.
CAL:
WOMAN:

Really?
It's

South
Africa.
I
love
it.
[GABBY

CAL
SPEAKING
And
I
told
him
never
to
assume
And
I've
been
to
Maine,
so
that's
a

Oh,
I
love
Maine.
-
Have
you
been
to
Waterville?


Greece,
Italy.
Greece,
Italy?
Wanna
get
out
of
here?
-
You're
driving.

I
have
never
experienced
that
-
Pretty
great.
-
God
bless
technology.
I
went
and
met
this
girl
the
other
night.
I
felt
like
I
was
doing
it
with
the
two
-
Ha-ha-ha.
Statler
and
Waldorf.
And
she
was
like,
"Look
at
this
frown
You're
so
serious.
What,
it's
serious
Oh,
my
God,
if
it's
gonna
be
hard
work,


HANNAH
:
Hey.
Hot
guy
from
the
bar
Tsk.
Liz,
I'm
studying.
You
should
be
studying
the
ceiling
I
am
eating
a
caramel
apple.
In
what
world,
honey?
Come
on,
take
a
break.
And
by
get
out...
...I
mean
have
hot
guy
from
the
bar
knock
What
is
wrong
with
you?
You
should
be
studying
the
curve
Okay,
goodbye,
Liz.
That
too
much?
Hello?
BERNIE:
Look,
I
gave
him
the
cologne
...and
I
don't
think
we
should
really
WOMAN:
I
just
thought
you'd
wanna
know
What
about
Mr.
Weaver,
Mom?
Um,
just,
apparently,
Mr.
Weaver
-
What?
CLAIRE:
She's
almost
an
adult.
Lots
of
young
BERNIE:
I
don't
like
this
S-E-X
talk
in
front
CLAIRE:
First
of
all,
they
can
spell.
I
think
we
were
right
in
choosing
Emily.

JESSICA:
Oh,
um...
Madison,
I
just
had
a
question
for
you.
Okay,
Jessica,
what's
up?
It's
kind
of
on
the
personal
side.
Yep,
my
lips
are:

Seals.
My
lips
are
seals.


Okay.
Um...
My
question,
and
I
don't
mean
to
be
blunt
You're
always
sleeping
-
Always.
So
my
question
for
you,
Madison,
I
mean,
how
do
you
get
them
to
see
you
But
as
someone
that's
mature,
Well,
first
off,
I
have
a
huge
rack.
Uh,
yes,
you
do.
You
don't
have
a
huge
rack.
No.
-
Wait,
how
old
is
he?
MADISON:

-
Like
parent-old.
Yeah,
because
MADISON:
Rock
on.
MADISON:
You
are
so
dirty.
Oh,
okay.
You
gotta
force
his
hand.
You
know
what
I
mean?
Go
TMZ
on
his
ass.
-
Not
following.
-
Oh.
Oh.

-
Jeez,
Madison.
Stop.
You
put
that
on
his
radar
and
he
won't
see

-
Hey,
what's
going
on?
ROBBIE:
Jessica
Riley,
you
are
my
soul
mate.
-
The
love
of
my
life.
I
have
marked
myself
with
a
scarlet
J
Get
down
from
there.
ROBBIE:
Nathaniel
Hawthorne...
Are
you
mad?
Oh,
my
God.
-
What
are
you
thinking?
Took
me
like
four
weeks
to
make
it.
JESSICA:
-
You'll
learn
to
love
me,
I
promise.
-
Because
I'm
four
years
younger?
Who
is
he?
He's
older.
And
I
didn't
want
my
parents
to
find
out.
You
know
I'll
kill
him
if
he
hurts
you.
Yeah,
I
know.
Okay,
Robbie,
this
has
to
stop.
Okay?
No
more.
Grow
up.
I'll
see
you
around.


CAL:

Okay.
So
you're
seeing
Mom
tomorrow
Yeah,
no
biggie.
What's
with
all
the
moping?
Uh,
nothing.
It's
just...
There's
a
girl.
-
A
girl,
huh?
You
like
her?
I
like
Pringles.
I
mean,
this
girl...
...she's
incredible.
She's
my
soul
mate,
you
know?
She
doesn't
even
care.
But
she's
your
soul
mate,
right?
Yeah.
Well,
you
just
don't
give
up
on
her,
Why
not?
You
did.
I
didn't
give
up.
Okay,
it's
more
complicated
than
that.
I'm
a
different
guy
now.
You're
not
different.
It's
not
that
simple,
kiddo.
-
What
kind
of
crap
is
that?
You
love
her
or
you
don't.
I
know
you
do.
I'm
serious,
Dad.
I
just
need
some
Go
get
her
back.
Wow,
how
old
are
you?
EMILY:
You
look
great,
Cal.
Oh.
Ha,
ha.
Well,
it
turns
out
I've
been
buying
Oh,
well,
whatever.
Thanks.
You
always
look
great.
Oh,
thanks.
-
So
I
spoke
to
Nanna
yesterday.
Um...
Like
Nanna.
She
worries
about
us.
What
teacher
is
this?
Ms.
Tafferty.
She's
the
one
he
pulled
Mm-hm.
God,
he's
such
a
weird
kid.
-
I
kind
of
like
him,
though.
Yeah,
me
too.
Me
too.
That
other
one's
in
jail,
probably.

So
how's
it
going
with
David?
Oh,
you
know,
it,
um...
It
wasn't,
um...
That
didn't
mean
anything.
-
I
mean,
you
know,
if...
You
seeing
anybody?
Me?
Mm-mm.
Oh,
you
know.
Well,
you
hear
things,
No.
No.
Not
real...
You
know
me.

Yeah,
well...
No.
I
miss
you,
Em.
I
made
an
effort
when
we
were
younger,
I
mean,
miniature
golf
and
dancing.
I
had
to
be.
I
just...
I
don't
know.
I
guess
I
got
lazy.
I
got
boring,
is
what
I
got.
No.
And
I'm
so
mad
at
you.
I'm
really
mad
at
you
for
what
you
did.
But
I'm
mad
at
myself
too.
Because
I
should
not
have
jumped
Because
you
fight
for
your
soul
mates.
Least,
that's
what
my
13-year-old
son
He's
a
really
strange
kid.
He
scares
the
shit
out
of
me.
I
miss
you
too.

Mr.
And
Mrs.
Weaver?
No
way
in
hell.
-
Cal,
what
are
you
doing
here?
Yes.
Yeah,
right.
We've
met
before,
yes.
-
"We
have
met
before"?
Seriously?
So
I'd
like
to
introduce
you
Hi,
I'm
Robbie's
mom.
She's
your
wife
again.
How
convenient.
So
shall
we
enter?
-
Okay.
CAL:
I'm
sorry.
I'm
playing
catch-up.
-
Um...

Maybe
your
husband
should
tell
you.
We...
I
think
we
met
at
last
year's

Did
I
miss
it?
Did
I
miss
the
parent-teacher
Yeah.
I
don't
remember.
Why
don't
we
just,
uh,
focus
on
Robbie?
KATE:
Yes,
let's
do
that.
Let's...
Let's
focus
on
Robbie.
As
you
know,
...was
when
he
set
a
school
record
for

Asshole.
Ha-ha-ha.
You're
familiar
with
this
word,
Yes,
I
am.
And
I've
spoken
to
Principal...
Asshole.
As
in
someone
who
tells
