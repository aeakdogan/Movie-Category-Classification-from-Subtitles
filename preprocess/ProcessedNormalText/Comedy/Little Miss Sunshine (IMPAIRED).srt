You're
kidding?
Oh,

Olive.
Almost
like
a
real
person.
-

-
What

to
your
arms?
That's
all
right.
-
How's
the,
uh,
routine

A
couple
of
days.
What's

Chicken?
-
Holy
God
Almighty'
It
is
possible
just

Been
nine
months,

I
think
it
shows
-
Richard.
Really.
I
think
we
could
Dwayne
has
a
goal.
It
may
not
be
my
dream,
but
he's
pursuing
it
with
In
fact,
I
was
thinking
Oh,
for
crying
out
loud'
And
how
Dwayne's
utilizing
seven
of
them
Richard,
please.
Well,
I'm
just
saying
I
think
he
could
use
our
support.
How
did
it
happen?
-
How
did
what
happen?
Honey,
here.

Oh,
no,
it's

I'm
pro-honesty
here.
Be
my
guest.
Olive,
um,
Uncle
Frank
What
happened
was
he...
You
did?
Why?

I'm
sorry.
I
don't
think
Honey,
let's
let
Uncle
Frank
Why
did
you
want
to
kill
yourself?

-
Richard.
Richard.
-
I
wanted
to
kill
myself-
-
I
was
very
unhappy.
-
Richard'
-
for
a
seven-year-old.
-
Okay.
Why
were
you
unhappy?
Um,
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons.
Mainly,
though,
I
fell
in
love
Who?
One
of
my
grad
students.
Him?
It
was
a
boy?
-
Yes,
I
did.
Very
much
so.
You're
right.
It
was
silly.
-
There's
another
word
for
it.
-
So,
that's
when
you
tried
to
kill
yourself?
The
boy
that
I
was
in
love
with
fell
in
love
-
Who's
Larry
Sugarman?
the
second
most
highly
regarded
-
Who's
number
one?
-
Really?
So
that's
when.
No.
What
happened
was
so
I
said
some
things
and
I
did
some
things
and
subsequently
and
forced
to
move
out
of
my
apartment

-
And
that's
when
you
tried
to-
Actually,
all
of
that
was
okay.
What
happened
was
two
days
ago
the
awarded
a
genius
grant
And
that's
when
I-
Decided
to
check
out
early.
Yes.
Yes.
And
I
failed
Olive,
the
important
thing
is
that
Uncle
Frank
He
made
a
series
of
foolish
choices-
which
is
something
winners
never
do.
So
that's
the
story,
okay?

not
because
of
your
brains
It's
because
you're
-
Grandpa?
-
I
don't
want
to
be
a
loser.
Where'd
you
get
the
idea

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,

You
know
what
a
loser
is?
A
real
loser
is
somebody

can
write
a
book
-
So
he
says
to
me-
Hello,
Stan.
You're
the
one
That's
what
I
thought
at
the
time.
But
it's
a
great
program.
It's
not
the
program,
Richard.
No
one's
heard
of
you.
What's
the
next
step?
There
is
none.
It
didn't
fly.
-
You-You
mean
give
up?
Hey,
wh-Whoa,
hey'
One
setback
here,
Richard,

I
rammed
it
down
their
fucking
throats,
It's
time
to
move
on.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
I'm
glad.
Because
this
is
what

and
he
looks
back
and
decides

were
the
best
years
of
his
life,
All
the
years
he
was
happy?
You
