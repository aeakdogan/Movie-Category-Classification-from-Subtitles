Mayor
West,
The
Quahog
Oil
Refinery
is
emptying
I
mean,
you
couldn't
possibly
that
kind
of
blatant
industrial
pollution,

Yeah,
I
told

it
was
fine.

Mr.

I
promise
you
this.
Next
election,
I'm
gonna
run
against
you,
All
right,
Mrs.
Griffin,
But
if
you
plan
to
beat
me,
you'll
have
to...

What
is
it?

off
Which
leads
many
political
analysts
can
a
woman
really
be
mayor?
Or
will
she
just
bleed
all
over
the
city?
Oh,
you
guys,
I
can't
tell
you
It's
really
gonna
make
a
difference
Hey,
Lois,
take
a
look.

"No,
wait,
even
if
you're

Oh,
these
are

Chris,
why
don't
you
put
these
upstairs
But
the
evil
monkey
lives

Of
course,
he
hasn't
been
as
evil


Hi,
I'm
going
door-to-door
to
campaign
who's
offering
real
change
-
May
we
count
on
your
vote
next
Tuesday?
Ah.
Then
what
is
for
dinner?
-
Pork
chops.
Chris,
have
you
been
to
any
other
houses?
I
have
not.
-
Would
you
like
to
come
in?
This
is
Tom
Tucker
Mayor
Adam
West
has
widened
his
lead
I'm
confident
that
the
people
of
Quahog
And
here
to
help
me
secure
is
actor
Jimmy
Smits.
Adam
West
likes
to
eat
food

That's
our
guy!
Boy,
this
election's
gonna
be
a
tight
one.
It's
probably
gonna
be
decided
And
here
we
are
sitting
here
-
Huh?
Ah.
We
got
to
give
Lois
a
last-minute
edge.
Guys,
I
need
you
to
help
out
Oh,
man.
That's
like
making
all,
like,
signs
You
know,
I
mean,
Lois
is
my
wife,
we
can
pretty
much
do
I
could
do
cocaine
if
I
wanted
to.
-
Peter,
you
want
some
potatoes?
-
I
was
just
asking
if
you
wanted...
Yeah,
we
got
enough
napkins.

What
time
is
it?
Is
that...
Is
that
straight?
Wait,
wait,
wait.
See,
I'll
fix
it.
No,
no.
Is
that
straight?
I
can't...

Meg,
sweep
that
up.
Just
get
a
broom.
Sweep
that
up.
Put
it
up
in
your
room,
Suspect
number
two,
All
right.
Ma'am,
I
know
that
you're
going
through
but
I
just
have
a
few
more
questions.
-
What?
to
cut
property
tax
in
half
What
does
that
have
to
do
Well,
you
say
number
two
did
it,
You
can't
do
that!
Sounds
like
Lois
Griffin
Hi,
when
you
go
to
vote
please
vote
for
Lois
Griffin.
That's
right.
I
work
at
a
deli,
And
that's
exactly
what
you'll
get

Oh,
snap.
Boy,
you
guys,
I
really
appreciate
Except
for
you,
Quagmire,
What
the
hell
you
talking
about?
Lois
is
gonna
get
the
entire
female
vote
I've
been
having
sex
for
the
past
two
days.
My
God,
if
I
tried
to
masturbate
right
now,
A
little
flag
with
the
word
"bang"
on
it.

Welcome,
Quahog,
between
incumbent
Adam
West
We
will
now
open
up
the
floor
Yes,
Mrs.
Griffin,
how
do
you
feel
that
put
a
blue
square
on
the
home
Well,
the
safety
of
our
children
is
a
very
important
part
of
my
plan
I
have
a
12-point
program
I'm
sorry,
your
time
is
up.

No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm
not
impressed.
Not
yet.
Mayor
West,
if
re-elected,
would
you
increase
the
frequency
Well,
citizen,
that's
an
excellent
question
I
think
it's
great
we
live
in
a
town
because
without
questions,
And
an
answer
without
a
question
Oh,
I
like
him!
He
looks
me
in
the
eye!

I'd
like
to
have
a
beer
with
him.
I
don't
understand
these
people.
He
didn't
even
say
anything
Lois,
undecided
voters
Try
giving
short,
simple
answers.
Sir,
your
question,
please.
Mrs.
Griffin,
what
do
you
plan
to
do
A
lot.

Because
that's
what
Jesus
wants.

9/11
was
bad.

-
I
agree
with
that!
Mrs.
Griffin,
what
are
your
plans
9/11.

Mrs.
Griffin,
-
9...
...11.

Well,
the
election
results
are
pouring
in
Which
reminds
me,
Diane,
Oh,
my
God,
I'm
an
absolute
wreck.
Well,
folks,
this
is
it.
The
last
of
the
votes
have
been
tallied,
Quahog's
new
mayor
is...
Lois
Griffin!

Oh,
God,
oh,
God,
oh,
God,
oh,
God!
Oh.
Were
we
done
cheering?

-
Well,
Mrs.
Mayor,
how
do
you
feel?
but
mostly
I'm
excited
Wow,
look
at
you.
All
that
power
And
the
first
thing
I'm
gonna
do
as
mayor
Well,
I
know
the
people
because
you
connect
with
them,
-
You
the
cow!
Wow,
Disney
gets
us!
And
I
think
we
all
realize
the
importance
of
stopping
being
done
to
Lake
Quahog.
Which
is
why
I'm
proposing
that
will
help
us
to...

No,
no,
no.
That's
awful.
-
No
new
taxes.
No
new
taxes!
No
new
taxes!
But
what
about
the
terrorists?

That's
right.
Terrorists.
We
have
intelligence
that
suggests
that
Hitler
is
plotting
with...
With
the
Legion
of
Doom
Using
the
lake
as
a
base.

ANNOUNCER:
Meanwhile,
How
did
she
discover
our
plan?
Me,
Solomon
Grundy,
And
we
also
have
evidence
that
Darth
Vader
tried
from
unwed
teenage
mothers.
Those
things
all
sound
scary!
How
much
money

A
hundred
thousand?

I
threw
a
10!
At
the
top
of
the
news,
thanks
to
the
efforts
We
now
go
to
Asian
reporter
for
her
slant
on
the
story.
Thanks,
Tom.
Once
again,
happy
locals
are
frolicking
and
we're
here
with
their
reactions.
Sir,
how
does
it
feel
to
have
the
lake
back?
Well,
I'll
tell
you,
Tricia,
as
a
local
resident,
I
feel
like
I
can
once
again
take
pride
I
think
this
is
really
gonna
And,
if
you
look
around,
I
think
And,
you
know,
that's
something
and
I
think
we're
gonna
be
seeing
Hey,
you
guys.
Mom,
everyone
on
TV
says
Maybe
you
could
do
some
damn
laundry
-
What?
-
Wow,
Mom,
is
that
a
new
purse?
Well,
don't
tell
anybody,
Brian,

I
may
have
dipped
into
the
tax
surplus.
Wait
a
minute.
You
used
taxpayer
money
It's
no
big
deal,
Brian.
Besides,
there
was
a
lot
left
over
and
I
figured
Lois,
spending
even
one
penny
-
is
incredibly
unethical.
My
God,
that's
more
than
I
spent
I
thought
you
said
we
was
going
Bitch,
I
thought
I
said
just
shut
up
What
the
hell's
up
Well,
since
Lois
is
the
mayor,
I'm
allowed
to
reroute
-
What'd
you
do
that
for?
-
of
Jim
Varney.
This
is
some
dad-gum
nice
house
That's
Vern-Vern-Vern-Vern.
Oh,
wait,
wait.
It
was
John
Belushi.
-
Peter,
how
could
you...
My
mistake.
I'll
take
care
of
this.
-
Hey,
Jim,
come
out
in
the
yard,
will
you?

He
got
the
shotgun,
Brian!
Don't
ask
me
how
he
did
it,
-
Run
for
your
life!
Run!
-
Excuse
me,
how
much
is
this
coat?
Oh.
Do
you
think
you
can
give
me
Well,
I
think
you're
doing
a
great
job,
-
How's
everything
going
out
here?
Good.
'Cause
if
you
screw
up,
I'll
kill
you.
Hi,
Bob
Grossbeard,
Quahog
Oil.
-
I'd
like
to
buy
you
that
coat.
All
I
ask
in
return
just
a
little
bit
of
dumping
in
your
lake.
This
guy
don't
sit
right
with
me,
Lois.
-
But
I
just
cleaned
up
Quahog
lake.
-
I
want
the
coat.

Brian's
gonna
be
really
upset
I'll
just
take
him
for
a
ride
in
the
car,

Wait
a
minute,
I
know
where
we
are.
We're
near
the
park,
Lois!
Hey,
hey,
Lois!
Lois!
There's
another
dog
in
that
car!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Are
you
seeing
that?
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
we
would
like
to
thank
Mayor
Lois
Griffin

Let
the
dumping
resume!
-
What's
going
on?
Oh,
see
now.
Mmm-hmm.
The
black
dolphins.
See,
the
honky
dolphin
always
trying
I
mean,
can't
we
all
just
swim
along?
You
know
what
I'm
gonna
do?
And
you
know
what?
Get
them
motherfuckers
on
the
line.
Hey,
Jake,
how
long
can
you
hold
Longer
than
you!
Check
it
out!

My
face!

-
Lois,
what
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Oh,
I'm
a
crook,
am
I?
Do
you
want
people
to
find
out
You
better
play
ball
I'll
play
ball.
You
know
what,
West?
Politics
does
terrible
things
Good
for
you,
Lois.
I
was
so
consumed
by
power
and
money,
I
became
the
very
thing
Hooray,
I'm
mayor
again!
Don't
we
need
to
have
There.
Now
no
one
We
all
heard
him
say
it.
-
Anybody
else
hear
anything?
