MAN
ON
TV:

would
like
to
dispute
this
fact,
we
French
know
the
truth:
The
best
food
in
the
world
The
best
food
in
France
And
the
best
food
in
Paris,
some
say,
Gusteau's
restaurant
booked
five
months
in
advance.
And
his
dazzling
ascent
has
made
his
competitors
envious.
He
is
the
youngest
chef
ever
Chef
Gusteau's
cookbook,
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
bestseller
list.
But
not
everyone
Amusing
title,
Anyone
Can
Cook!
What's
even
more
amusing
is
that
I,
on
the
other
hand,
And,
no,
I
don't
think
anyone
can
do
it.




REMY:
This
is
me.
I
think
it's
apparent
What's
my
problem?
First
of
all,
I'm
a
rat.
Which
means
life
is
hard.
And
second,
I
have
a
highly
developed

Flour,
eggs,
sugar,
vanilla
bean...
Oh!
Small
twist
of
lemon.
Whoa,
you
can
smell
all
that?
REMY:
This
is
Emile,
my
brother.
So
you
can
smell
ingredients?
This
is
my
dad.
He's
never
impressed.
He
also
happens
to
be
So,
what's
wrong
-
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa!
Don't
eat
that!
Turns
out
that
funny
smell
Suddenly,
Dad
didn't
think
I
was
feeling
pretty
good
about
my
gift,
until
Dad
gave
me
a
job.
Clean.
Clean.
That's
right.
Poison
checker.
Cleanerific.
Cleanerino.
Close
to
godliness.
Which
means
clean.
Never
mind.
Move
on.
Well,
it
made
my
dad
proud.
Now,
don't
you
feel
better,
Remy?
Noble?
We're
thieves,
Dad.
And
what
we're
stealing
is,
It
isn't
stealing
if
no
one
wants
it.
If
no
one
wants
it,

Let's
just
say
This
much
I
knew:
If
you
are
what
you
eat,
But
to
my
dad...
Food
is
fuel.
You
get
picky
about
what
you
put
Now
shut
up
and
eat
your
garbage.
Look,
if
we're
going
to
be
thieves,
why
not
steal
the
good
stuff
where
nothing
is
poisoned?
First
of
all,
we
are
not
thieves.
Secondly,
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
It's
dangerous.
REMY:
I
know
but
there's
something
about
them.
They
don't
just
survive.
I
mean,
GUS
TEAU
ON
TV:
Good
food
is
like
music
you
can
taste,
There
is
excellence
all
around
you.
You
need
only
be
aware
to
stop
REMY:
Oh,
Gusteau
was
right.
Oh,
mmm,
yeah.
Oh,
amazing.
Each
flavor
was
totally
unique.
But
combine
one
flavor
with
another,
and
something
new
was
created.

So
now
I
had
a
secret
life.


The
only
one
who
knew
about
it

I
found
a
mushroom.
Come
on,
you're
good
at
hiding
food.
He
doesn't
understand
me,
Why
are
you
walking
like
that?
I
don't
want
to
constantly
Did
you
ever
think
about
how
we
walk
that
we
handle
food
with?
You
ever
think
about
All
the
time.
When
I
eat,
I
don't
want
to
taste
Well,
go
ahead.
But
if
Dad
sees
you
walking
like
that,

What
have
you
got
there?
Ah,
oh,
oh...

You
found
cheese?
And
not
just
any
cheese.
That
would
go
beautifully
And...

This
rosemary!
This
rosemary
with
maybe
with
a
few
drops
Well,
throw
it
on
the
pile,
I
guess,
We
don't
want
to
throw
this
in
But
we're
supposed
before
sundown
or,
Emile!
There
are
possibilities
We
got
to
cook
this.
Now,
exactly
how
we
cook
this
Yeah.
The
key
is
to
keep
turning
it.
Get
the
smoky
flavor
nice
and
even.

That
storm's
getting
closer.
Hey,
Remy,
you
think
that
maybe



You
got
to
taste
this!
This
is...
It's
got
this
kind
of...
It's
not
really
a
smoky
taste.

It's
got,
like,
this
"ba-boom,
zap"
-
What
would
you
call
that
flavor?
Yeah.
It's
lightning-y!
Okay,
when
the
next
storm
comes,
I
know
what
this
needs!
Saffron!
Saffron.
Why
do
I
get
the
feeling
-
it's
in
the
kitchen?


-
REMY:
Saffron.
Saffron.
Don't
like
it.
She's
gonna
wake
up.
I've
been
down
here
a
million
times.
She
turns
on
the
cooking
channel,
You've
been
here
a
million
times?
I'm
telling
you,
saffron
will
be
Okay.
Who's
Gusteau?
Just
the
greatest
chef
in
the
world.

-
Well,
not
excessively.

You
could
fill
a
book,
a
lot
And
they
have,
which
is
why
I
read.
I
don't
like
secrets.

All
this
cooking
while
we
read
and
cook.
It's
like
you're
involving
me
in
crime,
Why
do
I
let
you?
What's
taking
those
kids
so
long?
Ah,
I'Aquila
saffron.
Italian.
Huh?
Gusteau
says
it's
excellent.
GUS
TEAU
ON
TV:
Forget
mystique.
Hey!
That's
Gusteau.
Emile,
look.
Great
cooking
Great
cooking
You
must
be
imaginative,
You
must
try
things
that
may
not
work.
And
you
must
not
let
anyone
because
of
where
you
come
from.
Your
only
limit
is
your
soul.
What
I
say
is
true.
Anyone
can
cook.
Pure
poetry.
REPORTER:
But
it
was
not
to
last.
Gusteau's
restaurant
lost
after
a
scathing
review
It
was
a
severe
blow
to
Gusteau,
and
the
brokenhearted
chef
which,
according
to
tradition,
Gusteau
is
dead?
Oh!

Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Run!
No,
you'll
lead
her
to
the
colony!



-
Help,
Remy,
help!
-
Help,
Remy,
help!

Try
to
grab
you.

Emile,
swing
to
me.








Evacuate!
Everyone,
to
the
boats.

-
RAT:
Let
me
through!
-
RAT:
Let
me
through!
Excuse
me.
Move,
move.


Go,
go,
go,
go.
Move,
move,
move.
Get
the
bridge
up!
Move
it,
move
it!
FEMALE
RAT:
Push
off.
Come
on.
Get
hold!

-
Take
the
baby.
Here!
Hey,
wait
for
me!

Is
everybody
here?
-
Wait
a
minute.
Where's
Remy?
I'm
coming!
Hold
on,
Son.
Come
on,
boy.
Paddle,
Son.
Come
on.
Reach
for
it.
You
can
do
it.

-
Remy!
Come
on.
You
can
make
it.



Guys,
wait.
Stop!
Remy.
Come
on.
Paddle.
Hold
on!
Wait
for
me.
Hold
on.

Dad?
Dad?
Which
way?




REMY:
I
waited
for
a
sound,
a
voice,
a
sign,
something.



If
you
are
hungry,
Why
do
you
wait
and
mope?
Well,
I've
just
lost
my
family,
probably
forever.
-
How
do
you
know?
You
are
an
illustration.
Well,
you
just
lost
your
family,
Yeah.
Well,
you're
dead.
Ah,
but
that
is
no
match
If
you
focus
on
what
you've
left
behind,
you'll
never
be
able
to
see
Now
go
up
and
look
around.



Oh!


WOMAN:
Champagne!

What
are
you
doing?

I'm
hungry.
I
don't
know
where
I
am,
and
I
don't
know
Remy,
you
are
better
than
that.
A
cook
makes.
A
thief
takes.
But
I
am
hungry.

Food
will
come,
Remy.
Food
always
comes

-
You
think
I
am
playing?



Paris?

All
this
time
Wow.
It's
beautiful.
The
most
beautiful.
Gusteau's?
Your
restaurant?
You've
led
me
to
your
restaurant.
It
seems
as
though
I
have.
Yes.
I
got
to
see
this.
HORST:

Hello,
Chef
Skinner.
HORST:
Bonjour,
chef.
-
Evening,
chef.
Hey,
boss,
look
who
is
here.
Alfredo
Linguini,
Renata's
little
boy.
-
Hi.
You
remember
Renata,

-
Yes.
How
are
you...
Yes,
Linguini.
So
nice
of
you
to
visit.
-
My
mother?
-
Yes,
Renata.
How
is
she?
Well,
not...
She's
been
better.
I
mean...
She
died.
Oh.
I'm
sorry.
Oh,
don't
be.
She
believed
in
heaven,
You
know,
afterlife-wise?

-
What's
this?
I
think
she
hoped
it
would
help
me,
you
know,
get
a
job
here.
But
of
course.
Any
son
of
Renata's
is
more
than...
Yes,
well,
we
could
file
this
We
have
already
hired
him.
What?
How
dare
you
hire
someone
We
needed
a
garbage
boy.
Oh,
garbage.
Well...
I'm
glad
it
worked
out.
Uh...

I
can't
believe
it.
A
real
gourmet
kitchen,
You've
read
my
book.
Which
one
is
the
chef?
Oh!
Uh...
-
Oh,
that
guy.
Who
is
next
in
command?
The
sous
chef.
There.
The
sous
is
responsible
for
the
kitchen
Saucier,
in
charge
of
sauces.
Chef
de
partie,
demi
chef
de
partie,
Commis,
commis,
they're
cooks.
You
are
a
clever
rat.
Now,
who
is
that?
Oh,
him?
He's
nobody.
Not
nobody.
He
is
part
of
the
kitchen.
No,
he's
a
plongeur
or
something.
He
washes
dishes
or
takes
out
-
But
he
could.
How
do
you
know?
Anyone
can
cook.
Well,
yeah,
anyone
can.

Well,
What
is
he
doing?

He's
ruining
the
soup.
It's
your
restaurant.
Do
something.
What
can
I
do?
But
he's
ruining
the
soup!
But
he's
ruining
the
soup!

COLETTE:
Table
five
coming
up,

LALO:
Coming
down
the
line.
Ah!
COLETTE:
Hot!
Open
oven!

Ah!
HORST:
Coming

Ooh!
COLETTE:
Oui,
chef.
HORST:
Fire
those
souffls
-
COLETTE:
Five
minutes,

Tonight,
It
has
a
wonderful
finish.
-
REMY:
Ooh!
Hmm.

HORST:
Ready
to
go
on
table
seven.
WAITER:
Oui,
chef.




Remy!
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Is
this
going
to
become
a
regular
thing
You
know
how
to
fix
it.


The
soup!
Where
is
the
soup?
Move
it,
garbage
boy!
You
are
cooking?
How
dare
you
cook
in
my
kitchen?
Where
do
you
get
the
gall
to
even
attempt
something
I
should
have
you
drawn
I'll
do
it.
I
think
the
law
is
on
my
side.

Larousse,
draw
and
quarter
this
man
after
you
put
him
in
the
duck
press
-
What
are
you
blathering
about?
Soup?
Stop
that
soup!
No!

Waiter.

Linguini!
You're
fired!
F-l-R-E-D!
Fired!
She
wants
to
see
the
chef.

But
he...

-
What
did
the
customer
say?
-
Ego?
-
LeClaire?
What
did
she
say?
-
Wait.
You're
the
reason
I'm
in
this
mess.

What
are
you
playing
at?

Am
I
still
fired?
-
COLETTE:
You
can't
fire
him.
LeClaire
likes
it,
yeah?
If
she
write
a
review
to
that
effect
and
find
out
you
fired
-

He's
a
garbage
boy.
How
can
we
claim
to
represent
if
we
don't
uphold
And
what
belief
is
that,
Anyone
can
cook.
Perhaps
I
have
been
a
bit
harsh
He
has
taken
a
bold
risk
and
we
should
reward
that,
If
he
wishes
who
are
we
to
deny
him?

-
You
were
escaping?
Since
you
have
expressed
you
shall
be
responsible
for
it.

Anyone
else?
Then
back
to
work.
You
are
either
very
lucky
You
will
make
the
soup
again,
Very
close
attention.
They
think
you
might
be
a
cook.
I
think
you
are
a
sneaky,

Rat!

-
Rat!
Linguini.
Get
something
to
trap
it.
HORST:
It's
getting
away.
-
What
should
I
do
now?
-
Now?
Do
you
know
what
would
happen
to
us
if
anyone
knew
They'd
close
us
down.
Our
reputation
is
hanging
by
a
thread
Take
it
away
from
here.
Far
away.
Whoa!
Doh!

Don't
look
at
me
like
that!
They
expect
me
to
cook
it
again!
I
mean,
I'm
not
ambitious.
I
was
just
trying
to
stay
out
of
trouble.
You're
the
one
who
was
getting
fancy
What
did
you
throw
in
there?
Oregano?
That's
a
spice,
isn't
it?
Rosemary?
You
didn't
throw
rosemary
in
there?
Then
what
was
all
the
flipping

I
need
this
job.
I've
lost
so
many.
I
don't
know
how
to
cook,
and
now

Did
you
nod?
Have
you
been
nodding?
You
understand
me?
So
I'm
not
crazy!
Wait
a
second,
wait
a
second.
I
can't
cook,
can
I?
But
you...
You
can,
right?
Look,
don't
be
so
modest.
Whatever
you
did,
they
liked
it.
Yeah.
This
could
work.
Hey,
they
liked
the
soup!

They
liked
the
soup.
Okay,
I'm
going
to
let
you
out
now.
But
we're
together
on
this.
Right?
Okay.





So
this
is
it.
I
mean,
it's
not
much,
but
it's,
Not
much.
It
could
be
worse.
There's
heat
and
light
So,
you
know,
what's
mine
is
yours.
Are
you...
Is
this
a
dream?
The
best
kind
of
dream.
One
we
can
share.

But
why
here?
Why
now?
Why
not
here?
Why
not
now?
What
better
place
to
dream
Morning,
Little
Chef.
Rise
and...

Oh,
no.
Idiot!
I
knew
this
would
happen!
I
let
a
rat
into
my
place
Eggs,
gone!
Stupid!
He's
stolen
food
That's
what
I
get
for
trusting
a...

Hi.
Is
that
for
me?
Mmm!
That's
good.
What
did
you
put
in
this?
Where'd
you
get
that?
Look,
it's
delicious.
But
don't
steal.
Oh,
no.
We're
going
to
be
late.

"Though
I,
like
many
other
critic,
"had
written
off
Gusteau
as
irrelevant
"the
soup
was
a
revelation.
-
Solene
LeClaire?
"Against
all
odds,
"Only
time
will
tell
if
they
deserve
it."

Well...
You
know.
Look,
I
know
it's
stupid
and
weird,
so
we
got
to
do
it
together,
right?
So
let's
do
this
thing!
I...




Welcome
to
hell.
Take
as
much
time
as
you
need.
Soup.

You
little...

Ow!






You
son
of
a...


You
got...




This
is
not
going
to
work,
Little
Chef!
I'm
going
to
lose
it
We've
got
to
figure
out
something
else.
Something
that
doesn't
involve
or
running
up
and
down
my
body
The
biting!
No!
Scampering!
No!
No
scampering
or
scurrying.
Little
Chef?
Oh,
you're
hungry.
Okay.
So
let's
think
this
out.
You
know
how
to
cook,
human.
We
need
to
work
out
a
system
in
a
way
that
doesn't
look
like
Would
you
listen
to
me?
I'm
insane!
In
a
refrigerator
talking
to
a
rat
-
I
will
never
pull
this
off!
We
gotta
communicate.
I
can't
be
constantly
checking
The
rat!
I
saw
it!
-
A
rat?
What
are
you
doing
in
here?
I'm
just
familiarizing
myself
with,
Get
out.
One
can
get
too
familiar
That
was
close.
Are
you
okay
up
there?
Whoa!

How
did
you
do
that?
That's
strangely
involuntary!
REMY:
One
look
and
I
knew
Okay.
Huh?

Where
are
you
taking
me?
Wait.

Whoa!

Whoa!
Okay.
Mmm-hmm...


Okay.




Whoa!
Whoa!

votre
sant!


All
right.
That
should
do
it.
Mmm.
Congratulations.
You
were
able
to
But
you'll
need
to
know
more
than
soup
Colette
will
be
responsible
for
Listen,
I
just
want
you
to
know
how
honored
I
am
No!
You
listen.
I
just
want
you
to
know
How
many
women

Well,
I...
-
Only
me.
Why
do
you
think
that
is?
Because
haute
cuisine
built
upon
rules
Rules
designed
to
make
it
impossible
But
still
I'm
here.
How
did
this
happen?

Because
I
am
the
toughest
cook
I've
worked
too
hard
and
I
am
not
going
to
jeopardize
it
Got
it?


Wow!
Easy
to
cook.
Easy
Chine-easy.

-
Excellent

Maybe

Or

Yes.

Get
my

Well,
the
will
stipulates
that
if
after
a
period
of
two
years
no
heir
appears,
Gusteau's
business
interests
I
know
what
the
will
stipulates.
What
I
want
to
know
is
if
this
letter...
There's
not
much
resemblance.
There's
no
resemblance
at
all.
Gusteau
had
no
children,
The
deadline
in
the
will
Suddenly,
from
his
recently
deceased
mother
Highly
suspect!
-
This
is
Gusteau's?
-
May
I?
But
the
boy
does
not
know.
She
claims
she
never
told
him,
-
Why
you?
What
does
she
want?
-
Only
a
job?
Then
what
are
you
worried
about?
you'll
be
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
Find
out
how
much
of
this
is
real.
I
will
need
you
from
the
boy.
Hair,
maybe.
Mark
my
words.
He
knows
something.
Relax,
he's
a
garbage
boy.
What
are
you
doing?

I'm
cutting
vegetables.
No!
You
waste
energy
and
time!
You

cooking
is
a
cute
job,
Well,
Mommy

had
to
face
the
dinner
rush
when
the
orders
and
every
dish
is
different
and
all
of
the
different
cooking
times,
but
must
arrive
on
the
customer's
table
at
exactly
the
same
time,
Every
second
counts,
What
is
this?
Keep
your
station
clear!
When
the
meal
rush
comes,
Messy
stations
slow
things
down.
Food
doesn't
go,
orders
pile
up.
I'll
make
this
easy
to
remember.
Keep
your
station
clear,

Your
sleeves
Keep
your
hands
and
arms
in,
Always
return
to
this
position.
Cooks
move
fast.
Sharp

You

unexpected.

They
are

you.
Now,

of
challenge

I

some
of
that
spice.
Okay.
What
are
you
doing?
You're
supposed
to
be
preparing
the
Gusteau
recipe.

The
recipe
doesn't
call
What

HORST:
Where

on
this.

Then
what
are
you
doing?
-
The
special?
Whoa,
whoa.


-
Don't
you
dare.
Sorry.
Is
Linguini's
dish

yet?
Ja.
It's
as
bad
as
we
remember.

Did
you

it?
Good.
What?
How

change
it?
He

break,
Little
Chef.
Get
some

We

it
tonight.
Dah!


Got
your
toque!
Oh,
seriously
now.
I'd
love
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you,
-
Am
I
in
trouble?
A
little
wine,
a
friendly
chat.

The
plongeur
won't
be
coming
to
you
He's
gotten
all
he
needs.

Toasting
your
success,
eh,
Linguini?
Good
for
you.
I
just
took
it
to
be
polite.
Of
course
you
don't.
But
you
would
have
to
be
an
idiot
not
to
appreciate
And
you,
Monsieur
Linguini,
Let
us
toast
your
non-idiocy.

my
brother.
Which
means
I
would,
too.

More
wine?
So,
where
did
you
train,
Linguini?
Train?

right.
Surely
you
don't
expect
me
to
believe

It's
not.
It's

Tell
me,
Linguini,
about
your
interests.
Do
you
like

horses,
rats.
I
brought
you
something
to...

Spit

out
