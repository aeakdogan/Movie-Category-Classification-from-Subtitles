Mr.President,
I
think
You
got
to
hand
it
to
those
Commies.
Yeah.
Those
trucks
sure
look
like
I
wonder
where
they
got
them
from.
Probably
bought
them
Okay,
open
up
at
200
yards.
Tell
him
where
you
are
and
that
but
nothing
more
than
that.
Alexi?
Alexi,
please.
But
I
don't
have
a
phone.
Give
him
the
phone.
I've
done
as
you
asked.
Hello?
Hello,
Dimitri?
Listen,
I
can't
hear
too
well.
Could
you
turn
the
music
down
That's
much
better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fine.
I
can
hear
you
now,
Dimitri.
Clear
and
plain
I'm
coming
through
fine,
too,
eh?
Well,
then,
as
you
say,
It's
good
that
you're
fine...
and
I'm
fine.
I
agree
with
you.
Now,
Dimitri...
you
know
how
we've
always
talked
of
something
going
wrong
The
bomb,
Dimitri.
The
hydrogen
bomb.
Well,
now,
what
happened
is...
one
of
our
base
commanders,
Well,
he
went
a
little
funny
You
know,
just
a
little
funny.
And
he
went
and
did
a
silly
thing.
I'll
tell
you
what
he
did.
He
ordered
his
planes...
to
attack
your
country.
Let
me
finish,
Dimitri.
Let
me
finish,
Dimitri.
Listen,
how
do
you
think
Can
you
imagine
how
I
feel
Why
do
you
think
I'm
calling
you?
Just
to
say
hello?
Of
course
I
like
to
speak
to
you!
Of
course
I
like
to
say
hello!
Not
now,
but
anytime,
Dimitri.
I'm
just
calling
up
to
tell
you
Of
course,
it's
a
friendly
call.
Listen,
if
it
wasn't
friendly,
They
will
not
reach
their
targets
I
am
positive,
Dimitri.
I've
been
all
over
this
It
is
not
a
trick.
I'll
tell
you.
We'd
like
to
give
your
Air
Staff
the
flight
plans
Yes,
if
we're
unable
I'd
say,
well...
we're
just
gonna
have
to
help
you
I
know
they're
our
boys.
Listen.
Now,
who
should
we
call?
Who
should
we
call?
The
Peoples
Central
Where
is
that,
Dimitri?
In
Omsk.
Right.
Yes.
You'll
call
them
first,
will
you?
Do
you
happen
to
have
the
phone
number
What?
I
see.
I'm
sorry
too,
Dimitri.
All
right,
you're
sorrier
than
I
am.
I
am
as
sorry
as
you
are,
Dimitri.
Don't
say
that
you're
more
sorry
because
I'm
capable
of
being
So
we're
both
sorry,
all
right?
All
right.
Yes,
he's
right
here.
Yes,
he
wants
What?
What?
What
is
it?
What?
The
fools.
The
mad
fools.
What's
happened?
The
doomsday
machine.
The
doomsday
machine?
A
device
which
will
destroy
All
human
and
animal
life?

Mandrake?
Have
you
ever
seen
a
Commie
Well,
I
can't
say
I
have,
Jack.
Vodka.
That's
what
they
drink,
I
believe
that's
what
they
drink,
yes.
On
no
account
will
a
Commie
and
not
without
good
reason.
Oh,
yes.
I
can't
quite
see
Water.
That's
what
I'm
getting
at.
Mandrake,
water
is
the
source
Seven-tenths
of
this
Earth's
surface
Why,
do
you
realize
that...
70%
of
you
is
water?
Good
Lord.
And
as
human
beings,
to
replenish
-
You
beginning
to
understand?
Have
you
never
wondered
why
I
drink
or
rainwater,
It
did
occur
to
me,
Jack,
yes.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
fluoridation
Yes,
I
have
heard
of
that,
Jack,
yes.
Do
you
know
what
it
is?
No,
no,
I
don't
know
what
it
is.
Do
you
realize
that
fluoridation...
is
the
most
monstrously
conceived...
and
dangerous
Communist
plot
Two
can
play
at
that
game,
soldier.
That's
nice
shooting,
soldier!
Mandrake,
come
here.
You
calling
me,
Jack?
Come
over
here
I
haven't
had
very
much
experience...
with
those
sort
of
machines.
I've
only
ever
pressed
a
button
In
the
name
of
Her
Majesty
and
the
Jack,
I'd
love
to
come,
the
string
in
my
leg
is
gone.

I've
got
a
gammy

Mandrake,
come

it
is
detonated,
it
will

that
in
ten
months...
the
surface
of
the

Come

What
a
load

bull.
I'm
afraid
I
don't
understand
Is
the
premier
threatening
to
explode
it
No,
sir.
It
is
not
a
thing
The
doomsday
machine
is
designed
Surely
you
can
disarm
it
somehow.
It
is
designed
to
explode
if
Automatically?
It's
a
Commie
trick!
Look
at
the
big
board!
This
is
absolute
madness.
There
are
those
of
us
But
in
the
end,
we
could
not
keep
up
in
the
arms
race,
the
space
race
At
the
same
time,
our
people
grumbled
Our
doomsday
scheme
cost
us
of
what
we
have
been
spending
on
defense
The
deciding
factor
was
when
we
learned
and
we
were
afraid
of
a
doomsday
gap!
This
is
preposterous!
I've
never
Our

Times.
Dr.Strangelove,
do
we
have
anything
A
moment,
please,
Mr.President.
Under
the
authority
granted
me...
as
director
of
weapons
research
I
commissioned
last
year
by
the
Bland
Corporation.
Based
on
the
findings
of
the
report...
my
conclusion
was
that
this
idea
for
reasons
which
at
this
moment
You
mean
it
is
possible
for
them
Mr.President,
the
technology
required
of
even
the
smallest
nuclear
power.
It
requires
only
the
will
to
do
so.
But
how
is
it
possible
for
this
thing
and
at
the
same
time
Mr.President,
it
is
essential.
That
is
the
whole
idea
Deterrence
is
the
art
of
producing
the
fear
of
attack.
And
so
because
of
the
automated
and
which
rules
out
human
meddling...
the
doomsday
machine
is
terrifying...
and
simple
to
understand...
and
completely
credible
I
wish
we
had
one
of
them
But
this
is
fantastic,
Strangelove.
It's
remarkably
simple
to
do
that.
When
you
merely
wish
to
bury
bombs...
there's
no
limit
to
the
size.
After
that,
they
are
connected...
to
a
gigantic
complex
of
computers.
Now
then,
a
specific
and
clearly
under
which
the
bombs
is
programmed
into
a
tape
memory
bank.
Hmm.
Strangelove?
What
kind
of
a
name
is
that?
He
changed
it
when
he
became
a
citizen.
It
used
to
be
Merkwurdichliebe.
Well,
a
Kraut
by
any
other
name,
The
whole
point
of
is
lost
if
you
keep
it
a
secret!
Why
didn't
you
tell
the
world?
It
was
to
be
announced
As
you
know,
Stay
with
me,
Mandrake.
All
right,
now
feed
me.
Don't
you
think
we'd
be
better
off
We're
okay
here.
Mandrake,
do
you
realize
that
there
are
studies
underway

Mandrake.
How
does
that
coincide
with
It's
incredibly
obvious,
isn't
it?
A
foreign
substance
is
introduced
without
the
knowledge
Certainly
without
any
choice.
That's
the
way
a
hard-core
Commie
works.
Jack.
Tell
me,
Jack.
When
did
you
first
become--
Well,
develop
this
theory?
Well,
I--
I
first
became
aware
of
it,
Mandrake...
during
the
physical
act
of
love.
Yes,
a
profound
sense
of
fatigue...
feeling
of
emptiness
followed.
Luckily
I
was
able
to
interpret
Loss
of
essence.
I
can
assure
you
it
has
not
recurred,
Women
sense
my
power...
and
they
seek
the
life
essence.
I
do
not
avoid
women,
Mandrake.
But
I
do
deny
them
my
essence.
Yes,
yes,
Jack.
Cease
fire!
My
boys
must
have
surrendered.
There
it
is.
Jack,
listen.
While
there's
still
time,
I
beg
you,
Those
boys
were
like
my
children.
Now
they
let
me
down.
No,
not
a
bit.
I'm
sure
they
all
gave
it
I'm
equally
sure
they
all
died
every
man
jack
of
them,
Jack.
Supposing
a
bit
of
water
Certainly
one
can
never
be
too
sure
But
look
at
me.
Look
at
me,
Jack.
Look.
And
I
drink
a
lot
of
water.
And
I
can
swear
to
you,
my
boy,
that
there's
nothing
wrong
Not
a
thing,
Jackie.
Mandrake,
were
you
ever
Well,
Jack,
the
time's
running
very--
-
What?
Yes,
I
was,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
Did
they
torture
you?
Yes,
they
did.
Not
a
pretty
story.
What
happened?
I
don't
know,
Jack.
It's
difficult
Well,
what
happened
was...
they
got
me
on
the
old
I
was
laying
train
lines
No,
I
mean,
when
they
tortured
you,
No,
I--
Well,
I
don't
think
they
wanted
me
It
was
their
way
of
having
The
strange
thing
is,
Those
clowns
outside
will
give
me
Yes,
you
may
have
quite
a
point
I
don't
know
how
well
The
answer
to
that
is,
And
my
advise
to
you
If
those
devils
come
back
we'll
fight
them
together
You
with
your
gun
and
me
"Feed
me,"
you
said,
You
know,
Mandrake...
I
happen
to
believe
in
and
I
know
I'll
have
to
answer
And
I
think
I
can.
Yes,
of
course
you
can.
I'm
a
religious
man
myself,
I
believe
in
all
that
sort
of
thing
You've
dropped
your
gun,
Jack.
No,
Jack,
let
me
take
that
for
you.
