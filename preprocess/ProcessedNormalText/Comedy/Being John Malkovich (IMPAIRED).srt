up.
Craig,
honey,
time
to
get
up.
Craig,
honey,
time
to
get
up.
-
Lotte.
-
Come
on.
Morning,
sweetheart.
What
are
you
gonna
do
today?
-
Working
in
the
workshop.
Maybe
you'd
feel
better
We've
been
over
this.
Nobody's
looking
for
a
puppeteer
I
know,
honey,
maybe
something
else
Derek
Mantini
Not
everybody
can
be
I
gotta
get
to
the
shop.
We
have
Will
you
do
me
a
favor?
-
He's
not
feeling
very
good
again.
-
The
chimp,
honey.

On
the
lighter
side
of
puppeteer
Derek
Mantini
with
a
60-foot
How
dreary
to
be
somebody.
How
public,
like
a
frog,


You
don't
know
how
lucky
you
are,
-
Because
consciousness...
is
a
terrible
curse.
I
think,
I
feel...
And
I'll
ask
in
return
And
they
won't
allow
it...
-




While
we
enjoy
and
abandon
ourselves
we
were
spared
God's
severity.
Say
no
more,
I
beg
you,
which
are
so
far
removed
-

Okay,
honey,
just
for
a
minute.
Even
during
when
our
prayers
should
be
pure...
Lewd
visions
of
these
pleasures
upon
my
unhappy
soul...
that
my
thoughts
are
instead
of
my
prayers.

Sometimes
my
thoughts
by
the
movement
of
my
body.
l
took
my
fill
and
this
was

You
motherfucker!


Oh,
Craig!
Honey,
not
again!
Why
do
you
do
this
I'm
a
puppeteer.

It's

My

She's

call
And
I
am
not
banging
her,
No,
sir,
not
at
all.
Ah.
Well,

Guinness

You

I
apologize
if
you
can't
understand
No,
I
understand
perfectly.
Oh,
it's
very
kind
You
see,
I've
been
very
lonely...
in
my
isolated
tower
-

-
Any
questions?
Why
are
these
ceilings
so
low?
Low
overhead,
my
boy!
But
seriously,
-



Welcome
to
As
you'll
now
be
spending
that
you
learn
a
bit
about
the
history
-
Hello,
Don.
Don,
I
was
wondering,
our
workplace
It's
an
interesting
story.
James
Mertin,
an
I
rish
ship
captain,
and
decided
to
erect
He
called
this
building
the
and
someone
else,
who
local
legend
Well,
one
day,
old
Captain
Mertin
-
Captain
Mertin?
I'm
not
a
child,
but
rather
I
see.
Well,
if
it's
be
gone
with
ye,
I'm
not
asking
for
alms...
but,
rather,
the
ear
of
a
kind
man

Captain
Mertin,
I'm
afraid
hat
Doorknobs
are
too
high,
and
high-ceilinged
rooms
Why
cannot
there
be
a
place
for
me

Therefore,
I
shall
make
ye--
And--
And
I
shall
build
between
the
seventh
and
the
eighth
so
at
least
there'll
be
one
place
where
ye
and
your
accursed
kind
So
that's
the
story
Since
the
rents
are
considerably
lower,
by
businesses
which,
After
all,
the
overhead
is
low.



Moving
story,
huh?
Unfortunately,
the
story's
bullshit.
Listen,
I'm
Craig
Schwartz.
Where
are
you
starting
out?


-
Shut
up!
Shut
up!
-
Shut
up!
I'm
sorry.
Sorry,
honey.
-
Sorry,
honey.
-
Shut
up!
-
Help!
She's
locking
me
in
a
cage.
-
I
just
taught
him
that
today.
-

-
You
want
to
do
some
dishes
for
me?
Here,
Elijah.
You
know,
I
have
an
appointment
-
Uh-huh.
of
this
acid
stomach,
-
Come
here.
-Just
get
down
from
the--
-
Feelings
of
inadequacy
Careful.
-
Mm-hmm.

So,
honey,
have
you
thought
any
more
Uh...
you
know,
-
economically
and
all...
that
I
think
maybe
we
should
just
wait
-
You
know?
I
was
thinking
about
-
about
the
orientation
film
I
think
maybe
-
And
50
other
lines
No,
I
was
just
talking
about
the--
Here's
the
thing.
If
you
ever
got
me,
you
wouldn't
have

I
wasn't--
I
was
talking
about
the
film.
Ooh,
what
magic
those
fingers
could
Maybe
you
could
alphabetize
me.
And
don't
forget...
"
I
"
comes
before...
"
U."
Floris,
I
think
you're
very
nice...
but
the
truth
is
that...
I'm
afraid
I
have
no
idea
-
You
bastard.
Don't
toy
with
Floris,
Schwartz.
-
Oh,
no--
I
wasn't
toying
with
her,
sir.
-
Pardon
me.
How
old
are
you,
sir?
Carrot
juice,
and
lots
of
it.
I
swear,
sometimes
it's
not
worth
it.
And
I
have
to
piss
sitting
down...
Like
a
goddamn
girly-girl,
-
Mm.
Ah,
to
be
a
young
man
again,
Maybe
then
Floris
But
the
elderly
have
so
much
to
offer,
I
don't
wanna
be
I
want
to
feel
Floris's
I
want
my
body
to
inspire
lust...
in
that
beautiful,
complex
woman.
I
want
her
to
shiver
Schwartz,
as
I
penetrate
her
wet--
Dr.
Lester,
while
I'm
flattered
perhaps
the
workplace
is
not
All
right.
You're
right.
Meet
me
after
work
today
and
I'll
spill
No,
I
won't
be
late,
Lotte.
Listen
to
Lester's
sexual
fantasies
It's
a
job
thing,
really.
Yeah.
So,
I'll
talk
to
you
later,
okay?
Gotta
go
back
to
work.
Hi.
Do
you
know
that
I
don't
even
know
Yeah.
Um...
okay,
how
about
this?
If
I
can
guess
your
name
-

Why
not?
-

You
look
like
a...
Bar--
Ru--
Bell--
Lu--
L--
Carol--
Ta--
Shar--
Susann--
Emm...ily--
Mar...lar--
Maax...ine--
Yeah!
Nobody
told
me.
That
just
came
out.
So
where
do
you
live

but
I
don't
welsh.
Okay,
meet
me
If
you're
late,
I
walk.
Nubile.
Blonde.
Wet
with
desire.
A
harness,
if
you
like.
And
all
eyes,
Craig,
"
Ladies,"
I
begin.
"
I
am
the
love
god
Eros."
"
I
intoxicate
you.
My
spunk
is,
to
you,
Dr.
Lester,
this
is
but
I
gotta...
-
You
have
a
wife.
I'd
like
to
meet
her.
Shall
we
say
dinner
Thursday?
You
can
come,
too,
if
you
like.
Get
that?
That
was
a
joke.
-
That
was
a
good
one.
-
All
right.
Thank
you.


Maxine.
Maxine.
-
I
made
it,
Maxine.
Buy
you
a
drink,
Maxine?
Are
you
married?
-
Yeah.
But
enough
about
me.
-
What'll
you
have?
And
I'll
have,
uh,

Hay.
So,
uh...
I
don't
know--
-
I
don't
know
what
it
is
-
No!
No,
no,
no,
no.
-
It's
your
energy,
No.
I
am
really
"
I
am
really
attracted
to
you."
-
Well,
we
can
share
recipes
-
I
love
your
tits.
I
wanna
fuck
'em.
-
Not
a
chance.
So
tell
me
about
yourself,
huh?
If
you
can
get
your
mind
Well,
I'm
a
puppeteer.
-
I--
I've
been--

Hey.
-
Hey.
I
just--
Lester
just
wouldn't...
Hi,
Elijah.
We're
supposed
to
have
but
I
can
get
us
out
of
it,
He's
like
this
insane
old
leech,
-
once
you
get
past
No.
I'm
not
hungry.
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
-
I
was
worried.
-
You
know...

you
wanted
me
to
work.

-
How
was
your
evening?
Tom-Tom's
puncture
wound
-
The
ferret?
Right.
So
I
just
dressed
the
wound...
and
I've
just
been
feeding
everyone
-
You
want
a
beer?
Elijah's
gonna
sleep
-
I
don't
think
he's
feeling
very
well.
Hm.
Well,
you
know
what?
I'm
gonna
go
-
But
I'll
be
in
a
little
while.

Tell
me,
Craig,

Well,
Maxine,
Perhaps
it's
the
idea
of
becoming
Being
inside
another
skin...
thinking
differently,
feeling
differently.
Interesting,
Craig.
Would
you
like
think
what
I
think,
More
than
anything,
Maxine.
It's
good
in
here,
Craig.
It's
better
than
You're
not
somebody
You
play
with
dolls.
Puppets,
Maxine.
It's
the
idea
-
and
seeing
what
they
see
-
It's
just
that,
well--
-

I
feel
something
for
you,
you
know,
about
anybody,
And
I
just--
I
really
feel
-
Oh!

Shit.
Hm.
-

Yeah.
Yeah.
-
3-2-3-6-4.
Yep.


-




Oh,
you
know
what?
I
know,
I
can't
think

Good
afternoon,
sir.
-
The
Broad
Hurst
Theater,
please.
Hey,
say,
uh...
Yes.
John,
uh--
What
is,
uh--
Uh,
don't
tell
me.
-
Malkovich.
-
Yeah.
I
thought
you
were
The
one
where
you
played
-
I
never
played
a
jewel
thief.
-
Who
am
I
thinkin'
of?
Just,
uh--
No,
no,
I'm
pretty
sure
it
was
you.
-
The,
uh--
'Cause,
uh--
-


Yeah.
Absolutely,
doll.
Yeah.
I'm
just
about
to
close
up.
Cool.
Bye.
I'm
splittin'
for
the
day,
puppet
man.
-
Don't
you
wanna
know
-
Please,
this
is
important.
It
is.
There's
a
tiny
door
It's
a
portal,
You
see
the
world
and
then
after
about
15
minutes,
into
a
ditch
on
the
side
Sounds
great!
Oh,
he's
an
actor.
He's
one
of
the
great
Oh,
yeah?
Lots
of
things.
He's
very
well
respected.
this
is
a
very
odd
thing.
It's
supernatural,
I
mean,
it
raises
about
the
nature
of
self,
You
know,
am
I
me?
I
had
a
piece
of
wood
in
my
hand.
I
don't
have
it
anymore.
Did
it
disappear?
Is
it
still
in
Malkovich's
head?
Do
you
see
what
a
metaphysical
I
don't
see
how
I
could
go
on
living

-
Yeah?
Maxine!
Yes,
of
course,
Maxine.
Good.
We'll
sell
tickets.
-
Tickets
to
Malkovich?
Two
hundred
dollars
a
pop.
But,
Maxine,
there's
something,
I
don't
know
if
maybe
I
need
you
for
this,
Craigy.
You
need
me?
-
Sure,
whatever.
-
Hey,
everybody,
I'm
home.
-
Treats
for
everyone.
-

Yeah?
-
It
might
be
dangerous
to
toy
with?
Well,
I'll
protect
you,
doll
face.
-
Bye-bye.

-
Who
was
that?
I'm
going
to
be
working
a
lot
because
Lestercorp's
open
But
it's
a
good
thing,
'cause
it's
gonna
'cause
we're
gonna
But
I
don't
understand.
There's
no
such
thing
as
a
hole,
Yes,
there
is.
I
was
inside
John
Malkovich
lookin'
out.
-
Really?
-
I
wanna
try
it.
I
want
to
be
That'd
be
perfect,
The
thing
is,
Lestercorp's
open
during
But
if
you
want
to,
-
Now?
Right
now?
I'll
meet
you
on
the
side
of
the
road
I'm
scared.
You
don't
have
to
do
this,
you
know.
No.
No,
l-l
wanna
go.
-
You
sure?
Okay.




It's
wet.
Weird.
That's
nice.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh,
mmm!
Oh!
Mmm.
God.


Lotte,
are
you
all
right?
Craig!
Craig,
-
No!
-
No!
I
gotta
go
back
now!
Wow!
Being
inside
did
something
to
me.
I
knew
who
I
was.
It's
like
everything
made
sense.
But
you
weren't
you.
God,
I
was.
I
was--
I
was
John
Malkovich.
I
was--
-
Take
me
back,
Craig.
So
tell
me,
Lotte,
Oh,
yes,
Dr.
Lester.
You
were
just
explaining
of
ingesting
minerals
Oh!
Be
still,
my
heart.
Dr.
Lester,
would
you
mind
pointing
With
the
greatest
pleasure,
my
dear.
You
go
up
the
grand
escalier...
and
once
atop
the
stairs

door
on
my
left.
-
Watch
the
step
down.
It's
sunken.
"Malkovich

What
do
you
think
Lester's
relationship
That
portal's
been
boarded
up
forever.
I
bet
Lester's
not
even
aware
of
it--
No
reason.
Do
you
think
that
it's
kind
of
weird
Do
you
think
that
it
might
have
I
don't
know.
I
don't
even
care.
I
think
it's
kind
of
sexy
Sort
of
like
It's
sort
of
vaginal,
he
has
a
penis
and
a
vagina.
It's
sort
of
like...
Malkovich's
feminine
side.
I
like
that.
"Visit

Sounds
good.
-
Want
me
to
phone
it
in?

-
Lotte!
-
I
heard
your
voice.
Is
this
your
partner?
I
had
to
do
the
Malkovich
ride
again,
-
Hi.
You're
Craig

Lotte,
Maxine.
-
Have
you
done

You
should
really
be
at
work.

I've
been
going
over
and
over
It
was
amazing.
I've
decided--
that
I'm
a
transsexual.
-
I
know
it's
the
craziest
thing,
Craig!
No.
It's
just
that
for
the
first
time,
I've
got
to
make
sure.
But
if
the
feeling
is
still
there...
I'm
going
to
talk
to
Dr.
Feldman
This
is
absurd!
If
you're
going
to
do
something,
You
get
these
half-assed
ideas,
Just
drop
it.
It's
just
that
I
really,
you
know,
So
I
thought
that
Is
there
something
-Why
do
you
always
yell
at
me
like
this?
It's
just
a
phase.
It's
the
thrill
Okay?
It'll
pass.
Don't
stand
in
the
way
-

-
Okay.
Right
now?
Uh-huh.
It's
the
middle
of
the
day.
-
Yawn.
Figure
it
out.
Let's
go.
-
Bye.



Davey,
it's
Max.
Listen,
can
you
get
me

But
what
I
had
been
through.
I
am
hungry
as
the
winter.
I
am
sick,
anxious,
poor

Fate
has
tossed
me
hither
and
thither.
I
have
been
everywhere.
-
So
strong.
-
every
minute,
day
and
night...

my
soul
has
been
full

anticipation.

see
it
coming."


-
Yeah?
-
Yeah.
Who's
calling?

you
get

Malkovich?
Wow.
You
really
are
great
in
that
movie
Oh,
Thankyou
very
much.
-
I
have
a
cousin
who's
a
retard.
So,
as
you
might
imagine,
to
see
retards...
portrayed
on
the
silver
screen
Well,
thank
you
very
much.
Good
night.
-
Maxine?
It's
Maxine.
I'm
so
glad
you
decided
to
come.
I'm
John.
Good.

I
wasn't
sure
but
I
felt,
uh,
oddly
compelled.

The
way
you're
looking
at
me--

I've
never
been

I
must
say,
And
the
funny
thing
is,
Mr.
Malkovich...
my
voice
is
probably


So,
I
mean--
So,
how
was
it?
He
wasn't
doing
anything
really.
He
was
just
hanging
I
think
he's
probably
just
a
really...
See,
men
can
feel
I'm
glad
you're
coming
You
shouldn't
be
so
quick
to
assume
is
gonna
be
the
answer
You're
right,
Craig.
You
know
what
I
was
thinking?
we
should
invite
Maxine
because
you
guys
are
partners
-
I
think
she'd
like
that.
What?
The
thing
is,
there's
been
business
stuff--

I'll
cook
my
lasagna,
tensions
will
just
melt
away.
Now,
when
you
say
that
I
can
be
Well,
we
mean
exactly
that.
We
can
put
you
inside
Can
I
be
anybody
that
I
wanna
be?
Well...
you--
-
Actually--
That's
perfect!
It's
my
second
choice,
It's--
I'm
a
fat
man.
Two
hundred
dollars?
Oh.
Oh,
uh,
yes.
-

You
gotta
crawl
in
there.
Oh,
my
God.

Oh.

No,
that's
what
I'm
saying.
See,
I
don't
So
if
I
get
the
set,
if
I
could
just
get
maybe
three...
extra
hand
towels--
uh,
if
I
get
the
set--
-

That
sounds
good.
And
for
the
color,
periwinkle?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Do
you
want
to
back
order?
No.
I'll,
uh...
go
with
the
loden.
Would
you
like
to
order
anything
else?
What
is
the
difference
between
and
the
bath
mat?


You're
my
friends.
Did
you
know
that
but...
49
words
for
snow?
-
Mm.

After
dinner,
Ah.
After
dinner,
I'll
introduce
you
He
has
an
ulcer
right
now
-
but
we're
working
through
it.

Oh.
-
This
the
bedroom?

The
thing
is,
is,
I
think
the
world
is
divided...
into
those
who
go
after
what
they
want
-
Right.
the
ones
who
go
after
well,
they
may
not
get

at
least
they
remain
vital.
-
Yeah.
So
when
they
lie
on
their
death
beds,
Right?

And
the
ones
who
don't
go
well...
who
gives
a
shit
-
God!
Craig!
I
don't
find
you
attractive,
hm?
And,
Lotte...
lam,
When
I
looked
into
his
eyes
last
night,
-
Really?
Behind
the
stubble
and
the
too
prominent
I
sensed
your
feminine
longing.
-
And
it
just
slew
me.

Oh,
my
God!
Oh!
Only
as
John,
sweetie.
Hey,
thanks
for
No
hard
feelings,
partner?


-

Hi.
It's
Lotte.
I'd
like
very
much
Can
you
call
him
Um...
when?
Mm...
tonight...
after
you
close?
Okay,
uh...
4:1
1
.
4:1
1
?
-
Thankyou,
Maxine.

Thanks
so
much
-
I'm
glad
you
called.
Shall
we
to
the
boudoir?
A
couple
of
minutes.
So
do--
do
you
enjoy
being...
Sure.
Yeah.
It's--

Hi.
Hi.
Oh.


Oh,
my
sweet
Maxine.
-
My
darling.

Did
you
call
me
Lotte?
Do
you
mind?
-
No,
not
really.
-
Oh!
-
My
sweet...
beautiful
Lotte.
Oh,
Maxine!


-


-


Yes!
-
Wow!
-


-
You
were
him,
weren't
you?
And
he
was
with
her!
We
love
her,
Craig.
-
"We
"?
-
Don't
forget
about
me!

I'm
sorry.

You
are
late,
my
little
cowboy.
Are
you
torturing
me
on
purpose?
-
I've
fallen
in
love.
You
know
why?
And
this
is
what
people
Well,
you
picked
the
unrequited
variety.
You're
evil,
Maxine.
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
it's
like
with
total
lust
and
devotion...
through
the
same
pair
of
eyes?
Wow.
It's
quite
a
thrill,
Craigy.





-
Aaah!
What
are
you
doing?
Oh,
my
God!
Is
that
real?
Yes!
I
don't
know
how
to
use
it
very
-

I'm
serious!
Suck
my
dick!

Shut
up,
okay?




-
Craig!
-

Be
all
that
someone
else
can
be.
I
need
to
see
you.
Sweetie!
Oh,
I
had
so
much
fun
Shoot.

Tell
her
what
the
hell,
Say
it.
What
the
hell,
you
know?

Live
dangerously.
Ooh,
doll.
I
love
this
new
All
righty.
I'll
track
down
loverboy
Exactamundo.



What's
the
matter
with
you?
Sit
up,
okay?
-


Help!
-

Shut
up!

Was
ever
woman
in
this
humor
wooed?
Was
ever
woman
in
this
humor
won?
Tommy,
can
I
take
1
5?

Goodnight,
everybody.
-
Oh!
Oh,
Lotte.


-
Lotte!
Move
right
hand
-Lotte!
Move
right
hand
-
Holy
shit,
yes!
-
Holy
shit,
he
said
what
I
said!
-
Lotte?
Is
that
you?
Yes,
sweetheart,
yes.
What
the
fuck
is
going
on?
-
Oh,
Lotte.
Something
was
making
me
talk.
Some
goddamn
thing
-
I've
gotta
get
out
of
here.
It
was
just,
uh,
No,
doll
face.
I
know
what
Bye!
I
did
it!
I
made
him
move
his
arms
Oh,
and.
..
I
made
him
talk
sort
of.
It's
just
a
matter
of
practice
is
nothing
more
than
another
puppet

I'll
tell
you
about
it

-


No,
man,
I'm
sorry
to--
I'm
sorry
to
have
called
you
like
that,
I
was
so
freaked
out.
I
mean,
it
was
like...
somebody
was
moving
my
arms,
moving
my
hands,
I
mean,
literally,
-
I'm
sure
you're
not
going
crazy.
-
It
was
like
nothing
-
Were
you
stoned?
Jesus.
Yes!
Yes,
I
was
stoned.
But
what--
That
doesn't
have
Charlie,
someone
was
talking
You
were
stoned.
-
How
hot
is
this
babe?
Maybe
it
was
this
because
it
could
have
been
her
Because
this--
this
Maxine
likes
Ouch.
That
is
hot.
Maybe
she's
using
you
Sounds
like
my
kind
of
gal.
Let
me
know
What
are
you
talking
about?
Done
with
You're
nuts
to
let
a
girl
go
Charlie,
I
don't
know
-
She
could
be,
like,
Hot,
lesbian
witches.
I
gotta
know
the
truth,
Charlie.
The
truth
is
for
suckers,
Johnny
boy.



Thanks.
This
way.


Excuse
me,
sir.
does
this
company
provide?
You
get
to
be
John
Malkovich
Two
hundred
clams.
I
see.
-
No
cutting,
by
the
way.
No
cutting!

Ah!
Ow!
Come
on!
Break
it
up!
-
Everybody
gets--
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Malkovich.
Get
inside!
-
Darling!
-
Uh,
uh,
John
Malkovich.
Mr.
Malkovich,
sir.
-
Mr.
Malkovich,
I
think
I
can
explain.
My
name
is
Craig
Schwartz...
and
we
operate
that
simulates,
for
our
clientele,
the
experience
of--
of--
of
being
you,
actually.
-
Simulates?
-
What
exactly
does
that
mean?
-
I
want
to
do
it
then.
-
I
want
to
do
it!
-
Let
him
do
it,
Craig.
Right
this
way,
Mr.
Malkovich,

What
happens
when
a
man
We'll
see.





Malkovich.
Malkovich,
Malkovich.
Malkovich,
Malkovich.
Malkovich,
Malkovich,
Malkovich?
-
Malkovich,
Malkovich.
-
Malkovich!
Malkovich.
Malkovich.
-
Malkovich!
-

-
Malkovich.
-
Malkovich!

Malkovich,
Malkovich
-
Malkovich!
-

Malkovich,
Malkovich


-
How
was
it?
-
That
was
no
simulation!
It's
such
an
honor.
I
have
been
to
the
dark
side.
I
have
Really?
For
most
people,
That
portal
is
mine,
for
the
love
of
God.
But,
Mr.
Malkovich,
sir,
I
discovered
that
portal.
-
It's
my
livelihood.
Do
you
understand?
It's
my
head!
I
will
see
you
in
court!
What
makes
you
think
I
won't
be
seeing
in
court?
Hey,
Malkovich,
think
fast!

Fuck!
Dinner.

You
know,
Craig,
built
on
love.
Well,
you
gave
up
that
claim...
after
the
first
time
You
fell
in
love
Yeah,
but
I
didn't
do
anything
about
it,
You
didn't
do
anything
out
of
respect
for
the
fact
That's
true.
God,
Lotte,
what
have
I
become?
My
wife
in
a
cage
with
a
monkey.
Craig.
I
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
What
am
l,
some
kind
of
monster?
I
don't
want
to
be
a
monster,
Lotte.
Craig,
you're
not
a
monster.
No.
I
know
you're
not
a
monster,
honey.
You're
just--
a
very,
very
confused
man.
I
love
you
so
much.
I
love
you.
-


-J.M.
Inc.
Lotte.
I've
been
thinking
about
us,
you
know?
-
We
have
to
meet.
I'll
see
you
in
Malkovich

Craig!










Oh,
Elijah!
You
really
are
magnificent.

-J.M.
Inc.
Honey
pie!
I
was
just
heading
out
No,
listen,
Maxine.
It
hasn't
been
me
It's
been
that
He's
had
me
locked
in
the
cage
-
Oh,
my
God!
I'm
sorry,
Maxine.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
miss
you
so
much,
Maxine.
So--
But--
-
Okay,
that
was
Craig
It's
because
he's
Well,
boy,
I'm--
Uh--
I'm
surprised.
-
What?
-
and
I
can
control
Craig--
I
thought
it
was
me
I
do.

It's
confusing,
you
know?
I
know.
-
Listen,
I
should
really
-
'Cause
I'm
gonna
be
-
What?
-
Maxine!
Wait!
Maxine!





-

-

I
can
explain
Listen,
don't
con
me,
Maxine.
I
don't
know
but
this
insanity
is
now
over.
Oh,
shut
up.
Craigy.
Craig.
Schwartzy,
are
you
in
there?


Lotte
called
me.
Really?
Well,
I'm
really
sorry
but
I'm
really
in
love
with
you,
and
Hmm.
Apparently
you
can
control
Yes,
I'm
getting
better
all
the
time.
I'll
say
you
are.
Hey,
let's
do
it
-
Then
we'll
make
him
-
Shut
up,
you
overrated
sack
of
shit!
Craigy.

Yes?
Hi,
Dr.
Lester.
It's
Lotte
Schwartz,
Oh!
Yes.
Oh,
my
God.
Look
at
you.
You're
soaking
wet.


Thankyou.

Much
better,
thank
you.
So,
my
dear...
what
is
it
that
brings
you
to
my
doorway
Well,
Dr.
Lester...
see,
l,
uh--
I
have
a
very
unhealthy
obsession
I
see.
You
mean,
the
performer.
Yes.
And
what
prompted
you
Well,
when
I
was
here
I
came
upon
a
room
that
seemed
to
be
So
I
thought
perhaps
have
some
appreciation
You
look
so
lovely,
my
dear...
standing
here
before
the
fire...
in
my
oversized
man's
robe.
Thankyou,
Dr.
Lester.
Tell
me...
what
is
this
strange
power
You've
gotta
help
me
understand
because
-
Wanting
to
what?
Wanting
to
be
John
Malkovich.
Oh,
I
see.
Well,
perhaps
you
can.
But,
Dr.
Lester--
I
am
not
Dr.
Lester.
I
am
Captain
Mertin.
I
don't
understand.
It
was
90
years
ago
And--And
I
found
that
and
that
I
could
live
forever
-
So
Dr.
Lester
is
such
a
vessel?
You
still
there,
sweets?
Hmm.
I
figured
out
how
to
hang
on
It's
all
a
matter
of
making
friends
Rather
than
thinking
of
it
I've
begun
imagining
it
that
I
enjoy
wearing.

Ah,
this
illustrates...
how
I
will
move
into
on
his
44th
birthday.
That's
when
he
becomes
ripe.
But
I
must
enter
After
that,
I'd
get
diverted
into
I
don't
want
that
to
happen.
-
I'd
be
absorbed.
Well,
uh,
trapped,
held
prisoner,
unable
to
control
anything...
for
ever
doomed
to
watch
the
world
Now
I'd
like
you
See,
I
got
lonely
so
I
figured
out
a
way
this
time
Come.

Everyone,
this
is
Lotte.
-
Hi,
Lotte!
Do
a
puppet
show
for
me,
Craig,
honey.
You
mean,
with
Malkovich?
-
I'd
love
to
see
your
work.
-
Uh-huh.
Okay.
This
is
something
"Craig's
Dance
of
Despair



That
was
incredible!
You
see,
Maxine,
Oh,
my
darling,
It's
playing
with
people.

Stay
in
him
forever.

My
darling,
how
will
we
make
Well,
we'll
have
all
the
money
plus
he
does
get

-
Shut
up!
We're
trying
to
think
here.
It
is--
-
I-l-l
like
that
about
it.
And
no
one
would
ever
even
And
I
could
use
to
launch
my
own
puppeteering
career.
Oh,
Craigy.
Oh.
Oh.
So
lovely.
I've
always
wondered
So
lovely.
I've
always
wondered
-
Now
I'll
know.
Lotte?
We
can
see
you're
a
kind
and
so...
we've
decided
to
offer
you
if
you
like.
Dr.
Lester...
you've
been
so
kind
to
me...
and
trusting.
And...
there's
just
something
I
think
you

John's
here
Of
course
send
him
right
in.
Don't
ever
-


Great
to
see
you.
-
This
is
my
fiance,
Maxine.
Sorry
about
the
cunt
at
reception.
Can
I
get
you
anything?
No,
thank
you.
-
Teresa,
get
me
chicken
soup.
Chicken
soup?
Larry?
Uh...
From
now
on,
I'm
no
longer
an
actor.
Okay.
Great.
And
I
would
like
so
that
from
now
on
will
be
synonymous
with
puppets.
Sure.
Sure.
Poof,
you're
a
puppeteer.

Honey?
Maxine?
Maxine?
I'm
busy.
Maxine,
honey,
it's
on!


Yeah,
there's
the
truth,
and,
uh,
art
always
tells
the
truth,

one
of
the
world's
greatest
entertainers
how
we
view
puppeteering.
Tonight
we
look
at
the
man
and
the
woman
behind
the
man.
Raised
in
Evanston,
Illinois,
and
as
a
young
man
was
of
Chicago's
world-renowned
From
there,
it
was
a
simple
hop,
skip
and
Hollywood
stardom.
But
nothing
could
prepare
the
public
And
so
it
was
that
just
John
Malkovich
dropped
the
bombshell
through
the
entertainment
community.
Turning
his
back
on
his
and
pay
his
dues
allover
again

Hello,
ladies
It's--
It's
the--
I
miss--
I'm
really
John
Malkovich.

John
Malkovich's
rise
His
breakout
performance
occurred
-

I'd
fuck
me.
If
there's
anything
it's
feeling
like
I'll
be,
you
know,
deemed
an
imitator.
But,
um,
I
think
that
once
to
just
follow
through
on
I
think
that,
uh,
a
lot
of
us
Malkovich's
rise
to
fame
No,
no,
no.
What
are
you
doing?
-
I'm
making
him
weep,
John.
Don't
ever--

Until
the--
the
puppet
becomes...
an
extension
of
you,
it's
a
novelty
act.
It's,
uh--
No?

He
breathes
life
It's
a
very
godlike
thing...
to
be
able
to
take
something
and,

from
the
Beltway
to
Broadway...
aided
in
no
small
part
by
In
Maxine,
his
muse,
his
inspiration.
In
Malkovich,
-

This
travesty
will
And
the
crowds
have
been
and,
um,
I'd
just
like
to
thank
God
to
share
our
creative
vision.
Nothing
was
impossible
Their
union
was
a
joyous
one,
to
further
Malkovich's
John
Malkovich,
the
artist...
and
Maxine,
the
entrepreneur--
they
make
this
character...
this
protean
figure
But
some
say
Maxine
recoiling
from
the
limelight...
and,
rumor
has
it,

Malkovich
shows
us...
a
reflection
of
ourselves,
and
our,
you
know,
That's
what
makes
him
one
of
And
what
does
the
future
Well,
to
quote
the
Bard,
As
the
poet
said,
"The
puppeteer's
voice
It
can
be
one
of
the
pillars,
to
help
him
endure
and
prevail,"
It's
over!
Max?
I've
gotta
head
down
to
A.B.T.
now.
I've
got
the
