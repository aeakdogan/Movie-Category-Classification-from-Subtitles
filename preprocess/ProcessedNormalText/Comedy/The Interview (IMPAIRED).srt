REPORTER:
We
now
turn
to
the
The
rocket
they
are
testing
to
reach
the
West
Coast
Today,
an
official
tried
to
tell
the
world...
That
we
are
living
in
the
midst
A
young,
untested
leader
-
Kim
Jong-un.
We
are
talking
Good
evening.
I'm
Dave
Skylark.
Tonight,
we
are
joined
Oscar-winning
songwriter,
Detroit's
own
Eminem.
He'll
speak
with
us
which
has
been
mired
concerning
lyrics
that
some
view
Tonight...
on
"Skylark
Tonight."
And...
action.
"It's
hell
to
be
Shady.
"Yesterday
I
yelled
"at
an
elderly
lady.
"Then
I
asked
her
"'F'
word
a
senior
citizen.
Suck
a
wiener,
sit
and
spin."
-

It's
funny.
"And
why
you
drive
"Don't
you
want
to
get
"since
you'll
probably
die
"Die,
old
bitch,
die,
before
I
murder
you."
What
do
you
mean
by
this,
Em?
Well,
first
of
all,
like,
people
twist
my
words.
Okay,
but
can
you
see
how
an
old
person
"what
this
guy
is
telling
me...
go
kill
myself,
and
I...
I
mean,
I
don't
necessarily
rap
about
It's
more
about...
-
I
get
you.
-
if
I
say
something
about
women
I
think
a
lot
of
that
just
dealing
with
issues
with...
you
know,
old
issues
With
your
"mutha."
Yeah,
or-or...
you
know,
when
I
say
things
or
people
think
that
-
Mm-hmm.
Um,
when
I
rap
about
violence
-
Wait...
-or,
you
know,
sound
I
think
that,
uh...
you
know,
-
it's
more
or
less
because...
You
know,
it's
kind
of...
you
know,
confronting
it.
-
What
did
he
just
say?
-
He
said
he
was
gay.
-
Did
he
just
say
he
was
gay?
in
the
booth
we
just
heard
him
Em,
let's
just...
You...
just
said
that
you
were
gay?
Um...
and
I'm
just
curious
what
you
meant
I
mean
I'm
gay.
Uh,
I'm
just
a
little
can
mean
a
lot
of
things.
I
am
a
homosexual.
Meaning...?
I
like
men.
What
the
fuck
just
happened?
Eminem
just
said
That's
what
the
fuck
-
Holy
shit.
Eminem's
gay
on
our
show.
-
Eminem's
gay
on
our
show!

Holy
shit.
"Eminem
Gay?!"
Dave,
keep
him
talking.
-
Oh,
my
God.
-Holy
shit.
This
is
the
greatest
moment
...are
probably
shocked
by
what
I'm
more
shocked
that
people
I
mean,
it's
kind
of
like
Gay
peekaboo.
Yeah.
But,
um...
AARON:
Shit.

you
Thank
you.
Say
what
I
say:
What
did
you
mean
"I
said
nice
rectum,
I
had
a..."
"...vasectomy,
Hector.
"So
you
can't
get
pregnant
if
I
bisexually
wreck
ya."
I've
pretty
much
bread-crumb
trail
of
gayness.
-
I
see
that
now.
But
yeah,
actually
Hector...
Hector
was
a...
Hector
and
his
rectum
were
real?
-
Holy
shit.
-It's
real!
-
Yes!
Yes!
-Oh,

knew
it!

from

very
special
"Skylark
Tonight."


President
Kim

It
is
my
pleasure,
Dave.
You
know,
there
is
so
much
about
North
Korea
and,
uh,
me
personally.
-
Mm-hmm.
with
greater
intelligence
I
am
grateful
for
this
opportunity
and
for
the

forge
a

Indeed,

It's

to
say
that
you're

So,
what
I
want
to
know
is:
In
these
times
of
great
stress,
do
you
do
karaoke?
Yes,
I
do,
Dave.
I
believe
that
it
is

to
remain

This

Let's
take
it
to
a
serious
tip.
Supreme
Leader
Kim,
the
United
States,
which
has
an
enormous
stockpile
insists
that
countries
does
that
feel
Many
Americans
do
not
realize
that
the
war
in
North
Korea
was
entirely
the
fault
Damn!
Kim's
callin'
us
out!
-
You
really
are
still
hopeful?
hopeful
at
all.
America,
what
you
done
This
is
a
little
embarrassing.
So
when
you
think
of
all
that
The
wars,
the
floods...
do
you
think
that
your
people
for
their
resilience
Of
course,
Dave.
Then
why
don't
you
feed
them?

-

KIM
:
AARON:
I...
beg
your
pardon?
Why
don't
you
feed
your
people?
They
are
hungry.
Specifically,
Isn't
that
a
little
the
one
they
view
And
you
spend
$800
million
And
you
have
16
million
people
who
are
starving?
Are
you
sure
you
don't,
uh...
mean
to
ask
me
No,
I
want
to
know
about
that
other
thing
KIM:
Dave,
as
you
have
seen
we
have
a
great
bounty
of

DAVE:
was
a
fake
grocery
store
with
a
fake

KIM:

I
don't

it's
