Ok
children
I
know
that
today
is
the
last
day
of
school,
and
that
the
last
day
of
school
involves
pranks,
Now
what've
you
done
with
Mr.Hat??
Children,
I
want
Mr.Hat
back
right
now,
the
prank
is
over!
You
think
I
can't
get
along
without
Mr.Hat
don't
you?
You
think
I
can't
live
without
him.
Well
I
can.
He's
just
a
puppet.
I
don't
need
him.
See?
Watch.
GOD
DAMN
IT,
WHERE
THE
FUCK
DID
YOU
PUT
MR.HAT!!?!?!
Oh
no
you
don't.
The
school
year's
over,
but
summer
vacation
doesn't
start
for
you
little
bastards,
until
Mr.Hat
is
back
on
my
desk.
Now
I'm
gonna
turn
around.
And
when
I
turn
back,
Ok,
I'm
gonna
turn
around
now.
Shit!
Oh
golly!
Kevin
honey!
Good
to
see
you
again,
son.
Looks
like
winter's
right
around
the
corner.
Better
get
some
firewood
ready.
Oh
happy
summer
gentelemen.
Shut
up
Pip.
What
do
you
mean?
Well
I
have
to
spend
my
summer
in
summer
school,
because
I
can't
be
left
alone.
You
see
my
parents
are
dead.
Your
parents
are
dead?
God
damn
you
suck
Pip.
Oh
yeah
it's
summer.
That
means
we
gotta
buy
fireworks.
I've
picked
up
enough
money
to
buy
M-80s
this
year.
I
saw
in
this
movie
once,
where
this
guy
stuck
a
firecracker
up
a
cat's
butt.
Cool!
Maybe
we
can
do
that
to
Cartman's
cat.
If
you
so
much
as
touch
Kitty's
ass,
I'll
put
firecrackers
in
your
nut
sack,
and
blow
your
balls
all
over
your
pants!
Geeze
Cartman!
Well
I'm
just
saying
you
know
don't
make
my
Kitty,
you
know.
Hi
fellas.
What
can
I
do
for
you?
The
kind
that
fit
in
Cartman's
cat's
ass.
Screw
you
guys!
I'm
going
home.
What
a
baby.
I'm
sorry
fellas,
haven't
you
heard?
All
fireworks
have
been
banned
in
Colorado.
It
was
in
the
paper
this
morning.
Dude
just
cause
some
stupid
North
Park
kid
blew
his
hands
off,
Right.
How
can
they
do
this
to
us?
Yeah!
We've
been
playing
with
firecrackers
our
whole
lives!
Udas
kill
Kenny.
U
bastards.
A
summer
without
fireworks
is
like..I
don't
know,
Yeah
now
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
I
can
still
sell
snakes.
This
is
absurd.
We
need
fireworks
for
our
4th
of
July
celebration
at
the
lake.
I
don't
care
that
some
twirp
blew
his
hands
off.
We've
got
to
have
fireworks
for
our
picknick!
Hold
on
I've
got
another
call.
Hello?
No
I
don't
know
where
Mr.Hat
is!
Geeze
Garrison,
I've
got
bigger
problems!
Hello
yes.
Now
what
am
I
supposed
to
do
about
our
4th
of
July
show
at
the
lake?
No
I
don't
want
snakes!
This
is
an
outrage!
Get
me
the
Mayor.....I
know
that
smartass,
I
was
being
ironic.
I'm
sorry
Mayor
but
I
couldn't
find
the
little
man
in
the
boat.
Well
keep
looking.
This
is
ridiculous.
We
can't
have
a
celebration
without
fireworks.
Who
ever
heard
of
a
4th
of
July
picknick
with
snakes?
Oh
I
like
snakes.
You
light
em
and
they
grow
and
grow.
Wait
a
minute.
That's
it!
I've
got
it!
This
4th
of
July,
South
Park
will
make
history
by
having
the
largest
snake
in
the
world!
The
press
will
love
it!
I
found
him.
Man
it's
hot
out
here.
What
do
you
guys
wanna
do,
we
have
the
whole
summer
to
play.
Dude,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
I
know,
let's
go
sledding.
Come
on
Cartman
get
on.
Let's
go
dude,
we're
ready.
Guys,
don't
you
notice
anything
wrong
with
this
picture?
Yeah.
Your
fat
ass
isn't
on
the
sled.
Whatever.
What
the
hell's
going
on?
Hey
there
boys!
How
come
you're
not
blowing
things
up?
It's
summer!
Didn't
you
hear?
They
outlawed
fireworks,
because
a
little
boy
blew
off
his
hands.
What?!?
Oh
my
god!
Well
don't
worry
boys.
Buckle
your
seat
belt
Ned.
Mmmwhere
are
we
going?
Why
are
we
going
to
Mexico?
To
buy
fireworks.
Just
cause
some
kid
blew
off
his
hands,
doesn't
mean
the
rest
of
us
have
to
suffer
now
does
it?
Are
fireworks
legal
in
Mexico?
Hell,
everything's
legal
in
Mexico.
It's
the
American
way.
At
the
dynomite
firework
company,
we
have
a
commitment
to
excellence.
Our
focus
is
on
safety
while...
Now
the
disk
that
we're
making
is
aproximately
5000
times
bigger
than
the
average
snake.
We'll
have
to
fly
it
in
with
3
comanchi
helecopters,
Then
we'll
need
57
flame
throwers
all
set
up
around
the
perimeter
of
the
disk,
all
triggered
to
fire
at
the
same
time.
Flame
throwers
triggered
at
the
same
time
Once
lit,
the
snake
will.....grow.
And
good
times
will
be
had
by
all.
Wonderful,
spectacular!
Well
you
see,
fireworks
at
the
lake
will
not
only
go
on,
Wait
a
minute,
we're
gonna
need
an
orchestra
to
play
the
starts
and
stripes.
Hey
how
about
the
elementary
school
orchestra.
They
did
a
great
version
of
Mary
Had
a
Little
Lamb
at
their
last
concert.
Yes
get
the
school
principal
on
the
phone.
Uh
Mayor
I
think
you
mean
uncle
Sam.
Oh
course
I
do
you
fucking
asshole!
Dusty
the
dirtball!
Why
does
everything
have
to
suck
so
bad
in
summer.
Hey
look
it's
Mr.Garrison.
Summer
sucks
ass
Mr.Garrison.
Oh,
oh
that
old
thing?
Why
I
almost
forgot
he
was
gone.
I
don't
need
Mr.Hat.
Mr.Hat
is
just
a
puppet.
Mr.Hat
isn't
real.
Hey
guys,
my
mom
signed
me
up
for
swimming
Swimming
lessons
dude?
It
is
not.
Everyone
knows
that
the
first
graders

in
the
community
pool.
Yeah
Cartman,
you're
swimming
around
in
1st
grader
pee!
I'm
not
swimming
around
in
pee!
My
mom
says
if
I
take
swimming
lessons,
Yeah,
the
fatass
Olympics.
I'm
trying
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
situation!
I
don't
need
to
hear
crap,
from
a
bunch
of
hippie
freaks
living
in
denial!
Screw
you
guys,
I'm
going
home.
But
Cartman
we're
trying
to....
What
does
he
mean
"living
in
denial"?
There
how
does
that
look?
Like
a
big
hunk
of
dirt
with
a
carrot
sticking
out
of
it.
Ah
crap.
Ok
kids
everyone
in
the
pool.
Come
on
Eric.
We're
gonna
start
now.
Na-uh.
I
don't
wanna.
There
you
go!
Now
just
let
the
1st
graders
swim
by
you
and
then
head
towards
us.
Huh?
First

Awww

Weak!
Aww

sons
of
bitches!
Where

second.
Copy

Ok

I'm
sure
we're
a
little
rusty.
He's
taking
swimming
lessons.
Oh

How
are
we
supposed
to
sound
good
without
our
french
horn
section?
Oh,
let's
try
some
scales
first.
C
scale
first.
And...
Oh
ok,
that
was
pretty
good.
Oh
we're
doomed.
Our
4th
of
July
celebration
is
going
to
have
no
fireworks
and
a
bunch
of
tonedeaf
little
shits
playing....
Let's
move

one
giant
snake
thingy

Now
that's
a
Tijuna
bottle
rocket.
These
babies
have
the
power
to
blast
a
firehole
right
through
the
ozone.
They're
spectacular.
It's
our
job
to
get
these
to
children
all
over
America
for
the
4th
of
July.
We'll
be
like
Santa
Claus
on
Christmas
morning.
Bueno.
Hello

Mr.Hat

Is
this
some
kind
of
joke?
You

Uh,

Oh

Well
I'd

That's
doggie
paddle
Eric.
Now

Can

That's

Oh

Ah

Come

Well
4th
of
July
is
finally
here,
people
from
all
over
Colorado
Here
with
a
special
report
is
a
Thanks
Tom,
looks
like
the
firework
bad
won't
be
putting
a
damper
on
one
town's
festivities
tonight.
I'm
here
at
Stark's
Pond
in
South
Park
and
scores
of
tourists
anctiously
await
in
human
history.
Now
as
most
of
you
will
probably
remember,
snakes
are
these
little
round
disks
a
little
snake
of
black
ash.
Well
the
South
Park
snake,
and
20
stories
high.
I'm
told
that
this
even
won't
begin
until
Alrighty
then.
Looks
like
we're
ready.
How
are
your
swimming
lessons
going
Cartman?
I
heard
you
won't
even
get
in
the
deep
end.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
good
citizens
of
Colorado,
it's
my
pleasure
to
be
the
first
person
Let's
start
with
our
school
band
This
is
it.
And
a
one,
and
a
two,
and
a
....
What
the
fuck
is
that?
I
think
it's
the
stars
and
stripes.
Oh
hell,
light
the
snake.
Alright
Ned.
Now
we're
coming
up
to
the
American
border.
They
can't
know
that
we
have
fireworks
in
the
trunk.
I
guess
that
goes
without
saying,
doesn't
it?
Good
evening
gentlemen.
Hello
there
fellow
American.
We're
just
anxious
to
get
back
to
our
homeland.
Alright,
I
just
need
to
ask
you
a
few
questions.
Fire
away,
we
have
nothing
to
hide.
Is
anyone
other
than
the
2
of
you
traveling
in
this
vehicle?
No
sir.
Yeah....I
mean
no.
Open
your
trunk
please
sir.
Damn,
damn!
I
always
get
that
question
wrong!
My
god
it's
beautiful.
Say
uh
Charlie,
when
does
that
thing
die
out?
Die
out?
Yes
you
know,
expire,
end.
Hello?!?
I'm
asking
you
when
it
stops!
I'm
not
sure,
I
never
made
one
this
big.
I
guess
we
didn't
quite
think
this
through
did
we.
WHAT!?!?!
Dude,
that
thing
is
huge!
Ay,
you
guys
are
screwing
up
the
song.
Stop
it!
Kenny
watch
out!
Hey
guys,
I
dodged
the
thing,
and
it
missed
me...ah!
Oh
my
god!
They
killed
Kenny!
You...bastards!
Oh
my
god.
You
tell
me
how
much
longer
this
thing
is
gonna
last!
let's
see.
A
normal
snake
lasts
3
sec
So
when
does
it
run
out???
Oh
hell!
Coming
up
for
9
hours,
and
the
giant
snake
shows
no
signs
of
stopping.
Residents
have
tried
everything,
from
firehoses,
to
yelling
at
it
to
make
the
snake
stop.
But
nothing
seems
to
work.
Police
are
advising
all
citizens
to
stay
indoors,
and
not
ever
light
any
giant
snakes
in
the
near
future.
Man
this
sucks.
What
should
we
do
dude?
That
big
snake
keeps
growing.
We
should
do
what
we
always
do.
Ask
Chef
for
help.
Where
is
Chef?
Hello?
What?
Oh
hello
children.
A
giant
snake!
Killing
everybody!
Growing
bigger?!?
Children...you
know
I
rarely
say
this
but....well
fudge
ya.
What'd
he
say?
Wow!
All
over
America,
Yay,
let
the
spirit
of
heavenly
father
be
blessed
upon
you.
From
this
day
on,
all
will
be
well.
I
already
feel
like
things
are
getting
better.
And
I
can't
sleep
or
think.
Well,
um
let
me
ask
you
this.
How
the
fuck
should
I
know?
Well
I
guess,
I
see
what
you're
saying.
At
first
I
was
sure
one
of
the
children
took
him,
but
then
I
remembered
that
Mr.Hat
Are
you
gay?
What?
Are
you
propositioning
me?
Well
I
can
tell
you
that
I'm
100%
not
gay.
Well
I
believe
you.
I
absolutely
believe
you.
Mr.Hat
on
the
other
hand.
Mr.Hat
was
gay?
Sometimes
he
fanatsizes
about
same
sexualations.
I
see.
in
a
bottle
of
a
Thousand
Apple
dressing.
That
I
did
not
need
to
know.
Well
I'm
just
saying.
Mr.Garrison,
I
think
that
Mr.Hat
was
You
see
it's
you
that's
gay,
so
you
act
out
your
gay
persona
with
a
homosexual
puppet.
What
do
you
think
about
that?
I
think
you're
the
loony
one
in
this
room.
Serves
you
right
you
gay
bashing
homo!
Well
Ned,
looks
like
we
missed
4th
of
July
again.
Damn
it.
Those
poor
kids
must've
been
stupid
woossie
snakes
to
light.
MMwell
better
luck
next
year.
Yeah
you're
right.
Is
anyone
other
than
the
2
of
you
traveling
in
this
vehicle?
No.
Do
you
have
any
firearms
or
explosives
in
the
car?
Yes?
Damn
it,
I
got
it
wrong
again!
Holy
smokes,
what
the
hell
is
that?
It
looks
like
my
ex-wife!
Quick
Ned,
this
is
our
chance.
Hey
I
haven't
seen
you
in
here
before.
As
more
and
more
cities
are
effected
to
3000,
people
from
all
over
the
country
And
it
appears
as
if
thought
the
mayor
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
mayor
of
South
Park
But
she
is
sick.
Sick?
What
kind
of
lame
excuse
is
that?
Aw
this
is
ridicoulous.
She's
having
her
period.
We
do
however
have
an
official
about
the
matter
with
the
giant
snake
"We're
sorry,
our
bad."
Ook.
No
first
graders
around.
I
can
swim
to
the
deep
end.
I
can
do
it.
I
can
do
it.
I
can....
I'm
gonna
make
it.
How
many
days
left
in
summer.
Damn
it!
I
just
want
it
to
snow
again!
I
don't
think
it
matters
dude.
Buenas
Gracias
boys!
Hi
uncle
Jimbo.
Aww
now,
why
the
long
faces.
We're
bored.
There's
nothing
to
do.
Well
I
don't
think
that's
a
problem
Hooray!
Careful
with
those
now.
Those
are
dangerous.
Point
them
away
from
your
eyes
now.
Aww
look
at
em
Ned.
Hey
look!
We
blew
up
the
snake!
All
the
ash
from
the
snake
is
putting
the
flame
out.
Well
how
do
you
like
that.
I'm
gonna
make
it.
I
made
it!
I
made
it!
The
snake's
been
destroyed,
the
pool's
open!
Oh
no!
You
sons
of
bitches!
Aww
sons
of
bitches!
Look
they
put
out
the
snake!
Yes
apparently
my
plan
to
blow
up
Hey

snowing!
Well
it's
snowing
black
ash,
but
what
the
hell?
Winter's
back!
Wow,
it's
a
black
blizzard!
Mr.Garrison:
Where's
Mr.Hat?
Oh
I'm
through
with
Mr.Hat.
From
now
on
children,
That's

children.
Oh
I
can
hardly
wait.
Hey
children!
Everybody!
I'm
