The
rumors
of
my
promiscuity
I
used
to
be
anonymous,
If
Google
Earth
were
a
guy...
...he
couldn't
find
me
if
I
was
Pretty
cutting-edge
stuff,
huh?
Who
am
I?
What
does
it
all
mean?
But
don't
worry,
Though
it
sure
started
out
And
then
it
changed
pretty
quickly
...about
some
So
let
the
record
show
that
I,
...being
of
sound
mind,
...swear
to
tell
the
truth,
...and
nothing
but
the
truth.
And
what
better
way
...than
to
broadcast
them
So
here
it
is.
Part
one.
The
shudder-inducing
and
cliched,
...of
how
I
lost
my
virginity
Let
me
just
begin
by
saying
that
And
this
is
my
side,
George
is
not
a
sexy
name.
George
is
what
you
name
...not
the
name
you
wanna
And
by
that,
The
stable
and
self-perpetuating
...in
the
evolution
-
Right.
The
same.
But
I
don't
say
it
out
loud
I
think
you
know
innuendo
Innuendo?
What...?
Rhiannon,
Olive,
go
hit
the
books.
Also,
hugs
not
drugs.
And
any
other
cliches
Bye,
Mr.
Griffith.
Bye.
-
Watch
your
mouth.
Mr.
Griffith
Although,
...I
don't
know
if
I'm
still
You
know,
It
leads
to
unwanted
pregnancy,
Mismatched
tires
on
your
vehicle,
And
here
is
where
the
trouble
began.
Please,
please,
I'm
begging
you.
Rhi,
I
cannot
go
camping
I'm
sorry,
-
Okay?
I
told
you.
You
don't
know
him.
And
neither
do
you,
Yes,
I
do.
He
goes
to
college
Okay.
What's
his
name,
then?
Rhiannon
is
what
you'd
call
She
asked
me
to
come
camping
...and
I
don't
know
why
A
little
because
I
didn't
feel
like
But
mostly
because
her
parents
are
...and
I
live
in
California.
I
ate
dinner
at
her
house
once
-
This
is
interesting.
We
grew
it
You
want
some
dessert?
No,
thank
you.
Well,
I'm
not.
So
I
lied
and
told
her
...because
I
had
a
date
with
a
friend
Let's
just
face
it,
there
is
Yeah,
well,
mine
is...
...so
I
think
we
should
just
Fine,
don't
go
camping
with
us.
Go
get
your
chocolate
milk.
-
Do
you
want
one?
And
here's
how
I
really
spent
That's
the
worst
song
ever.
But
on
Monday,
when
Rhi
asked
me
He
was
charming,
you
know?
And
it
feels
like
I
got
a
love
Okay,
okay.
Wait,
wait.
No.
No,
probably
not.
You
know,
A
whole
weekend?
Yup.
-
Wait
a
minute.
No.
No,
of
course
not.
You
liar.
You
totally
lost
-
No,
I
didn't.
-
Tell
me
everything.
The
kind
that
does
it,
...and
doesn't
have
the
balls
-
What?
-
Rhi.
You
know,
you
call
me
"bitch"
-
It's
not
a
term
of
endearment.
You're
not
heading
Tell
me.
Fine.
We
did
it.
Yes!
Finally.
Now
you're
I
don't
think
letting
...behind
a
Bed
Bath
&
Beyond
There
were
a
lot
of
people
walking
Whatever.
This
isn't
about
me,
What'd
you
let
him
do?
It
was
normal.
You
know?
I
don't
know
I
guess
maybe
it
was
because
...I
had
sort
of
felt
superior
But
I
just
started
It
was
like
setting
up
Jenga.
Do
you
know,
like,
Glade
candles?
Those
kind,
but
they
were,
like,
-
He
was
sweet.
He
was...
What
the
hell
are
you
looking
at,
Just
a
couple
of
admitted
whores.
Marianne
Bryant
is
the
secretary
...chairman
of
the
Orange
Blossom
...and
president
of
...a
club
dedicated
to
shoving
Obviously
they
don't
care.
Last
year's
cause
celebre
was
Give
it
up
for
your
Blue
Devils!
Blue!
Blue
Devil!
Yeah.
Yeah!
How
can
we
exhibit
school
pride
...as
Satan
worshippers?
Now,
thankfully,
Give
it
up
for
the
Woodchucks!
Hey!
Go,
Woodchucks!
Woodchucks!
I
liked
Todd
much
better
Yeah,
but
even
dressed
as
a
woodchuck,
Woodchucks.
Now
Marianne
had
Me.
Which
brings
us
to
part
two.
The
accelerated
velocity
Which
is
really
just
my
obnoxious
way
And,
boy,
did
my
terminological
Did
you
hear
about
Olive?
No
way.
-
She's
not
a
virgin
anymore?
-
Olive
lost
her
virginity.
Maybe
next
time
a
certain
somebody
...what
she
says
Yeah,
about
that?
It's...
Can
I
talk
to
you
alone
-
You
gonna
be
okay?
Bye,
Nina.
What
you
heard
in
the
bathroom
-
It's
actually
a
funny
story.
Yeah,
yeah.
And
you're
Marianne.
We've
had
nine
classes
together
Ten,
if
you
count
Religion
...because
you
refused
to
go.
Yeah.
Listen,
I'm
not
the
one
...for
your
depraved
behavior.
There's
a
higher
power
Tom
Cruise?
I
hope
for
your
sake
Oh,
I
have
17
years'
worth
You've
made
your
bed.
I
just
hope
for
your
sake
-
Did
I
just
get
saved?
Oh,
you
too.
So
Marianne
spread
the
rumor.
For
the
first
time
ever,
my
sexual
Oh,
you
know
what?
I'm
wrong.
The
first
time
was
back
...when
all
I
wanted
was
a
kiss
from
Todd
and
I
were
thrown
together
Luckily
we
had
a
super
romantic
I
think
this
is
the
part...
...where
you're
supposed
to
That's
what
I've
heard,
anyway.
Just
give
me
a
second,
okay?
According
to
my
watch,
-
How
do
you
do
that?
Add
so
fast.
Don't
worry,
I'm
not
nearly
as
smart
So
if
we
didn't
do
anything,
Absolutely.
-
Thanks,
Olive.
I
actually
didn't
wanna
lie
When
people
thought
But
when
they
thought
Hey,
Olive.
How's
it
going?
I'm
swell,
Thanks
for
asking.
All
I
could
think
to
myself
was,
I'm
gonna
have
to
get
...and
pierce
something
You
guys
know
that
-
Yeah.
-
Yeah.
-
Yeah.
You
know
that.
Man,
I
would
slit
my
throat...
...rather
than
say
something
-
...that
you
didn't
want
me
to
say.
-
But
that
is
comforting.
That's
how
I
do,
as
they
say.
-
I
like
the
pants.
You
can
have
them
-
I'm
never
gonna
go
through
puberty.
But
we're
a
family
of
late
bloomers.
I
didn't
until
I
was
14.
Why
does
that
matter?
What?
Oh,
my
God.
Guys,
we
were
gonna
do
this
Listen
to
me.
Sometimes,
even
when
a
man
and
...like
your
mother
and
I
used
to...
...their
insides
just
don't
cooperate
So,
what's
going
on,
honey?
Why
do
you
want
us
to
take
a
bullet
It's
nothing.
It's
just
the
rumor
mill.
What's
the
rumor
mill
churning
out
You
know,
not
really.
Not
really.
Clever
wordplay.
I
like
it.
-
Only
by
marriage.
So,
what
we're
all
gonna
take
away
-
I
was
here
all
weekend,
right?
Remember
how
I
told
you
...if
I
was
dressed
up
Well,
the
next
day
if
I
was
dressed
That's
the
beauty
of
being
People
hear
you
had
sex
once
I
really
didn't
mean
for
the
lie
...but
I
gotta
admit,
So,
clearly
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
Even
I
had
trouble
with
him.
I
read
him
originally
when
I
was
5,
So
I'm
gonna
break
it
down
for
you.
Anson,
drop
me
a
beat.
-
What?
Push
it
up.
Yeah,
adultery,
vengeance
Crimes
of
passion
Kill
the
beat.
It's
pandering
...in
every
bad
movie
Ironically,
we
were
studying
Now,
isn't
that
always
the
way?
The
books
you
read
in
class
always
...with
whatever
angsty
Except
for
Huckleberry
Finn.
...who
have
ever
run
away
For
those
who
haven't
read
...or
for
those
who
said
here's
all
you
need
to
know.
This
girl,
Hester
Prynne,
...is
besmirched
and
made
to
wear
The
town
realizes
...and
she's
really
a
good
person,
A
whole
bunch
If
you
have
a
test
on
it,
but
make
sure
...not
the
Demi
Moore
version
where
...and
takes
a
lot
of
baths.
To
say
that
one
was
freely
adapted
What
we
have
to
realize...
...is
that
Hester
lived
A
time
when
the
worst
crime
...was
in
fact
adultery.
Nina.
I
think
Hester
Prynne
was...
Excuse
my
language...
A
skank.
A
skank?
So
you
don't
think
Why
should
I?
Perhaps
you
should
embroider
a
red
A
Perhaps
you
should
get
a
wardrobe,
Not
my
best
line,
...to
land
me
Seems
as
if
someone's
Seems
as
if
someone's
...she'll
be
saddled
with
I
hope
you
at
least
had
the
good
sense
Why?
Your
parents
didn't.
-
You're
going
to
hell.
I
can
assure
you
I
won't.
Good.
I
don't
care
who
started
it.
Penderghast.
So
why
am
I
just
meeting
you?
Language
like
this
would've
This
is
the
first
time
I've
done
This
is
foul.
I
know.
I
am
so...
Sorry
you
said
it
Sorry
I
said
it,
honestly.
And
sorry
I
got
caught
but
mostly
just
sorry
If
you
use
a
word
like
this
again
in
my
Yes,
sir.
Yes.
I
mean,
this
isn't
one
of
...where
teachers
are
called
...and
students
...and
there's
a
fundraising
auction
...where
the
more
creative
parents

the
community
garden.
This
is
public
school.
If
I
can
keep
the
girls
off
the
pole
I
get
a
bonus.
Now,
if
you're
sent
to
me
...you're
gonna
be
out
on
your
fantail.
Yes,
sir.
-
Good.
I
mean,
I
got
a
little
lost
but
I
found
my
way
back.
Detention
after
school
Now,
out.
Even
though
it
was
my
slutty
alter
ego
...it
was
my
ass
that
got
in
trouble...
...which
was
a
place
my
ass
Hey,
Olive.
Oh,
my
God.
The
illusion
is
shattered.
They
put
you
in
the
gas
chamber
if
you
I
think
they
just
fire
you.
-
Disney
World
is
more
liberal.
I
always
forget
Disney
World
Are
you
going
I
hadn't
planned
on
it.
Me
neither.
My
cousin's
getting
See
you.
Stay
excellent.
You
too.
-
What's
up,
kid?
Please
tell
me
the
rumors
are
true.
Yes.
Yes.
I
am
a
big,
fat
slut.
No,
the
one
where
you
got
suspended
...and
punching
her
in
the
left
tit.
I
worry
about
the
way
information
Rhi?
I
need
to
tell
you
something.
Like
the
exact
moment
-
I
think
I'm
in
love
with
you.
Tell
me
you
left
a
mark
-
It's
not
true.
It
was
the
right
one.
Can
you
listen
to
me
Okay.
It
didn't
happen.
Oh,
yeah,
right.
Your
secret's
safe
I
got
sent
to
the
principal
today.
Did
you
win
a
medal
or
something?
Not
exactly.
I
used
inappropriate
language
Although
we're
reading
a
book
...wildly
inappropriate
so
I
actually
felt
What
did
you
say?
Let's
just
say
Well,
what
did
it
start
with?
A
snide
comment
No,
I
mean
what
letter
-
T.
-
T?
Let
us
think.
T,
T,
T.
-
T,
T,
T.
-
Guys.
Noun.
It's
definitely
slang.
Tallywhacker?
Termagant?
You're
just
saying
sounds.
-
Spell
it
with
your
peas.
-
I
will
take
that
challenge.
I
like
that.
All
right.
So
does
this
have
anything
to
do
...that
you
mentioned
Do
you
need
to
talk
to
us
What's
a
twit?
That's
an
A,
honey.
It'll
get
you
sent
Sit
down.
We're
lucky
that
this
What
would
my
punishment
-
Bed
without
supper,
I
guess.
-
No
dating.
No
dating.
-
No
dating
for
you,
young
lady.
I
think
my
complete
lack
of
allure...
...already
kind
of
I
wouldn't
know
how
to
be
grounded
That's
right.
Love
you.
Come
here.
And
I
bet
that
girl
was
acting
Oh,
you
have
no
idea.
I
got
a
B-plus
That's
good,
honey,
but
everything
Just
kidding.
Where
are
you
from
originally?
So
the
next
day
...which,
thanks
to
recent
I
was
looking
forward
to
I
had
done
the
crime.
And
that
would
be
that,
Aren't
there,
like,
Not
in
high
school.
The
principal's
like
the
captain
He
can
even
marry
people.
We
haven't
talked
in
a
while.
Fabulous.
I'm
crushing
it.
I
wanna
be
in
detention.
Yeah,
why
are
you
here?
From
the
blood
I
saw
gushing
out
of
Principal
Gibbons
is
a
homophobe,
So
the
rumors
are
true.
I
don't
know
I
meant
about
So,
what's
with
your
new
look?
Oh,
haven't
you
heard?
You
know,
I
did
hear
something.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
I
also
heard
he
gave
you
crabs.
-
People
suck.
He's
not
real.
-
What?
-
The
guy
I
slept
with.
Wait,
you
started
the
rumor?
Indirectly,
I
guess
sort
of.
Or
actually,
no.
Well,
but
you're
perpetuating
it.
Excuse
me?
You're
not
even
a
real
slut.
It's
pathetic.
No
offense,
but
you
could
probably
Are
you
saying
that
I
should
That's
groundbreaking.
You
should
It
could
be
called
"The
Painfully
...the
Fake
School
Slut".
I
was
just
suggesting
that
...are
onto
something.
Maybe
that
whole
stuck-up,
No,
I
think
she's
just
And
there
are
some
of
us
who
are
Well,
then
you've
gotta
do
...or
decide
not
to
care.
I
can't
decide
if
you're
a
genius
Well,
don't
they
sort
of
go
-
So
you
heard
any
word
I
told
you,
that
was
a
one-night
stand,
You're
being
pretty
cavalier
Aren't
you
supposed
to
be
Yes,
I
believe
so.
in
Sweet
Valley
But
no,
I'm
not.
So
Brandy
Carter
...that
you
were
with
three
guys
Sounds
like
a
lot
of
work.
I
guess
that's
still
better
than
Who
said
that?
Do
you
know
that
Brandon
kid?
Isn't
he
a
homo?
Yeah.
Speak
of
the
devil.
Hello.
I
was
just
talking
about
you
You
know
Rhiannon.
She
curses
like
a
Somali
sailor.
-
Yeah.
That's
the
one.
-
Okay.
Hello,
what's
"bi-"?
What
is
"bi-"?
-
Bye.
Bedazzling
personality?
-
Big
tits.
Yes!
All
right,
well,
that
was
Brandon.
He
-
Probably
wants
to
borrow
an
outfit.
Heck,
yeah!
Big
tits!
The
next
day,
things
took
a
turn
...which
brings
us
to
part
three.
A
lady's
choice
Hi.
Is
there
an
Olive
here?
There's
a
whole
jar
of
them
I'm
sorry,
Just
kidding.
Come
on
in.
Any
friend
of
Olive's
Olive,
sweetie.
There's
a
young
man
He
said
something
about
asking
Oh,
happy
day,
Mama!
Oh,
I
thought
I
was
gonna
have
...on
booze
and
pills
A
gentleman
caller,
hurray!
-
What's
that?
-
A
boy?
-
Wow,
a
boy.
A
boy?
A
boy.
Welcome.
And
by
magic
I
mean
nothing.
-
Do
you
wanna
go
out
with
me?
Well,
I
mean,
like,
Brandon,
just
a
couple
hours
ago
True,
but
you
said
I
should
Yeah,
I
didn't
mean
with
me.
I
mean,
you're
a
nice
guy
and
all,
Yeah,
you're
not
really
Yeah,
I
know
that.
I
got
that
V
Do
you
wanna
Oh,
my
God,
dude.
You
completely
missed
the
point.
-
That's
not
what
I
was
saying.
I
should
act
straight
Then
I
can
be
whoever
I
wanna
be.
You
know
that
I
didn't
have
sex
I
just
told
everybody
I
did.
Actually,
I
told
one
person
I
did.
It's
like
wildfire.
So
you're
saying
I
should
just
say
I
had
sex
Yes.
Yes.
Oh,
no.
-
Wai...
Just...
-
No
way!
No
way!
-
No!
No,
no...
-
Absolutely
not.
-
We
could
help
each
other
out.
You
wanna
maintain
I
don't
wanna
get
pushed
into
shit
How
do
you
know
I
like
Because
at
least
Just
one
good
imaginary
bonk.
You
are
on
crack.
All
right?
It
doesn't
have
to
be
a
bonk.
It
could
be
an
imaginary
butterbean,
-
I
don't
know
what
any
of
that
means.
You
know
what?
-
I'll
pay
you
whatever
you
want.
Just
do
what
I
did
Who's
going
to
believe
me?
You
don't
understand
how
hard
it
is,
And
every
day
at
school
And
sure,
we
can
sit
...about
how
things
...but
this
is
today
and
it
sucks.
There's
only
one
way
around
it.
So
please,
just
help
me.
Because
I
can't
take
another
day
I
don't
do
anything
half-assed.
It'll
have
to
be
a
public
event.

All
of
your
tormentors
You
and
I
are
going
together.
You
have
to
do
everything
I
say
and

Thank
you
so
much
...you
know,
make
sure
you're
ready

What
the
hell
is
a

How
don't
I
know
any
of
this?
The
next
night
was
the
party
She
is
the
most
popular
girl
It's
partly
because
she's
pretty
...but
mostly
because
her
parents
...every
time
she
catches
them
...which
is
every
week,
Brandon
and
I
showed
up
I
borrowed
a
dress
from
my
mom,
...and
we
put
on
a
little
show.
Hey,
Olive
and
Brandon.
What's
up?
I
hope
you
don't
mind,
but
we
had
...like,
before
the
cocktail
party
Listen,
here's
the
sitch,
Brandon
was
just
in
the
middle
this
really
funny
thing...
...which
is
really
funny.
And
I
was
wondering
if
there's,
...where
he
could
finish
telling
me
...if
you
know
what
I
mean.
You
can
use
my
room.
Down
the
hall
to
the
left.
Cool.
Is
that
Olive
with
Brandon?
I
know.
What
the
hell,
right?
You
guys
are
my
buddies.
I'm
drunk,
bitches.
What's
up?
I
love
your
room!
My
sheets.
Put
a
towel
down.
-
Olive's
gonna
do
a
gay
dude.
-
What
are
you
doing?
Jesus,
what
is
with
you
gays?
Are
you
What
do
you
think
I
have
So
nice.
What
is
that,
lavender?
What
are
you
doing?
Can
you...?
Jacket
off.
Come
on.
All
right.
Come
on.
Now
grunt.
I
said
grunt,
not
whine.
Moan,
you
know?
God,
you
are
pathetic.
Good.
Good.
Oh,
yeah.
Oh,
yeah.
Oh,
yeah.
-
Oh,
yeah.
-
You
don't
have
to
be
so
aggressive.
-
No,
I
don't
like
that.
How
about
that?
-
Little
better.
I
like
that.
-
This
guy,
he's
gay,
no?
-
Don't
stop!
-
Don't
stop.
I'm
not
gonna
stop.
Now
you
try.
You
try.
I'm
gonna
turn
you
around
That's
not
gonna
make
people
Never
mind
that
gayness
Oh,
yeah!
Oh,
yeah!
-
That's
awesome!
That's
what
I'm
talking
about!
Do
you
smell
that?
Did
he
just
say
it
smelled?
Isn't
it
supposed
to
smell?
You're
not
supposed
-
It
doesn't
really
smell
that
bad.
-
Don't
stop.
Yeah!
-
You
ready
for
the
grand
finale?
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Come
on.
Oh,
my
God.
Go
forth,
my
son.
Hey.
Thank
you.
Seriously,
thanks.
-
Here.
Evidence.
What's
up?
Hey,
man.
How
was
she?
Well,
well,
let's
just
say
What?
-
I'm
drunk.
What's
up,
bitches?
-
Whoa,
hey.
I
thought
you
were
at
It
was
a
quick
rehearsal.
That
was
a
joke.
I
know.
Yeah,
sorry.
How's
it
going?
You
know,
I'm...
-
I'm
here.
That
rhymed.
I
liked
it.
Yeah.
-
I'm
gonna
go.
-
Yeah.
Bye.
Maybe
this
is
gonna
sound
...and,
believe
me,
it's
not
like
...or
a
string
quartet
or
anything...
...but
I
always
thought
pretending
...would
be
a
little
more...
...I
don't
know,
special?
Judy
Blume
should've
That
is
so
beautiful.
Never
had
one
lesson.
That
boy
from
yesterday
Well,
put
it
in
the
pile
of
gifts
-
Thanks.
He
seemed
a
little
incredibly
gay.
A
dyed-in-the-wool
homosexual,
I
just
want
you
to
know
your
father
We
love
you
no
matter
...of
your
opposite-sex
sex
partner.
We're
not
dating,
Mom.
And
don't
worry
about
...although
we
were
kind
of
hoping
...so
we'd
have
a
second
shot
Really
do
it
right
this
time.
-
Bye
now.
For
a
long
time,
actually.
Dear
God,
dear
Lord,
tell
me
you
did
No.
No,
no,
no.
Your
father
is
as
straight
A
little
too
straight,
I
don't.
Okay,
door's
right
over
there.
-
Take
it
down.
"Just
in
case
you
don't
shop
at
Target.
Brandon."
Hi,
Rhi.
Is
it
true
you
got
with
Brandon
Is
that
what
people
That's
what
everyone
Well,
then
I
guess
that...
Just
because
you
lost
your
virginity
-
...throwing
your
cat
at
everybody.
I
had
to
hear
from
Jackie
Rudetsky.
Do
you
know
Finding
out
you
slept
with
some
Must've
been
embarrassing.
Why
didn't
you
tell
me
I
would've
come
with
Are
you
really
making
this
-
You're
starting
to
get
a
reputation.
You're
pissing
me
off
I
think
it's
...to
let
her
know
that
everyone,
and
...a
dirty
skank.
Well,
do
you
think
I'm
a
dirty
skank?
You
know,
I
didn't
wanna
believe
it,
That
is
your
identifier.
And
you're
a
jealous
virgin.
So...
People
thought
Fine,
I'd
be
the
dirtiest
skank
Shit.
Is
everything
all
right?
It
sounds
like
...which
can't
be
true,
due
to
the
fact
He's
not
my
boyfriend.
Hey,
no
judgment.
I
was
gay
once
for
a
while.
No
big
deal.
Dad,
can
you
just
You
all
right,
buddy?
Yeah.
Give
them
hell.
-
Hey,
Anson.
I
just
realized
the
funniest
thing.
What's
a...?
What's
an
anagram?
Look
it
up,
big
boy.
What's
your
problem?
You
wanna
know
No.
That
was
a
rhetorical
question.
We
are
not
friends
anymore.
We
are
officially
over.
Oh,
rats.
I
want
my
Juicy
sweatshirt
back.
It
was
Burn.
-
Stop.
What
are
you
doing?
Nothing.
Don't
forget,
Guys,
we
have
a
problem:
-
We
need
to
pray
for
her.
But
we
also
need
to
Amen.
You
heard
what
happened
-
I
was
there.
I
heard
the
whole
thing.
-
...you
need
to
advertise,
Kurt.
I
tried
to
witness
to
her,
but
this
girl
is
defiant
Does
anybody
here
think
they
can
...what
she's
doing
is
wrong?
-
It's
okay.
-
I'm
sorry,
No,
it's
not,
Marianne.
-
It's
real.
Jesus
tells
us
to
love
everyone.
I
mean,
even
the
whores
and
It's
so
hard
because
they
keep
Make
me
a
promise.
Make
God
a
promise,
...that
we
will
remain
We
promise.
Awesome,
awesome,
awesome.
I
love
you
guys.
God
loves
you
guys.
-
Micah?
I
didn't
know
what
they
I
put
an
A
on
my
wardrobe
Maybe
it
was
because
I
was
wearing
Hey,
Olive!
You
left
your
glass
slipper
Yeah,
and
I
got
pumpkin
Nice.
Solid
joke.
It
sucks
because
we
could've
Oh,
my
God,
-
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
come
on.
Who
doesn't
Hey,
Olive.
Evan.
Hey,
what's
rocking?
Can
I
talk
to
you
for
a
second?
Yeah,
what's
up?
Don't
get
mad,
but
Brandon
told
me
Oh,
well,
rest
assured,
No,
he
told
me
the
truth.
I
was
just
hoping
Goodbye,
Evan.
Wait,
wait.
I
can
pay
you.
I
am
about
six
seconds
away
-
...your
teeth
will
bleed.
I
don't
need
your
permission,
What?
I
mean,
at
the
rate
you're
going...
...I
don't
see
how
people
-
Are
you
threatening
me?
You
are
repugnant.
That's
the
problem.
Never
mind.
I'm
sorry
I
asked.
I
knew
it
wouldn't
work.
I'm
just
a
fat
piece
of
shit.
When
will
high
school
end
already?
Shit.
I
want
a
$100
gift
card
deposited
Preferably
to
the
Gap,
but
I
will
Actually,
make
it
OfficeMax.
We
did
not
have
sex,
okay?
I
let
you
fondle
my
chest,
...unmatched
by
anything
Got
it?
Wait
a
minute.
-
Yeah.
Can
we
throw
in,
like,
some
-
What
are
you,
9?
-
Whatever.
Thanks,
Olive.
You
know,
the
sad
thing
is,
Evan...
...if
you'd
been
a
gentleman
...I
might've
said
yes.
Really?
Not
now
I
don't,
shit-dick.
It
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
the
...spread
around
the
school
Well,
faster
than
the
first
rumor
Guys,
come
over
here.
She'll
do
stuff
for
money.
But
for
people
who
knew
the
truth,
And
whether
I
liked
it
or
not,
Phil

gave
me

he
could
tell
people

got
it
on
during
Chemistry.

dollars
from
Panda
Express

showed
him
mine,

worth
of

better
Seriously?
A

Twenty
percent
Is
that
how
much
our
imaginary
tryst
I
fake
rocked
your
world.

It's
all
I
can
afford.
I
knew
he
wasn't
Latino,
...backdoor
deals
-
Beat
it,
ese.
Whatever
happened
to
chivalry?
Does
it
only
exist
in
'80s
movies?
I
want
John
Cusack
holding
I
wanna
ride
off
on
a
lawn
mower
I
want
Jake
from
Sixteen
Candles
I
want
Judd
Nelson
...because
he
knows
he
got
me.
Just
once,
I
want
my
life
Preferably
one
with
a
really
awesome
...for
no
apparent
reason.
But,
no.
No.
So
instead
of
all
that...
...I
get
to
save
15
cents...
...on
a
bottle
of
Juniper
Breeze
So
if
you're
still
with
me,
...this
brings
us
to
part
four.
How
I,
Olive
Penderghast,
...to
an
actual
home-wrecker.
-
You
wanted
to
see
me?
What's
going
on?
-
I'm
accessorizing.
I
think
you're
taking
your
reading
Well,
I
was
really
hoping
I'm
hearing
some
rumors.
Well,
those
are
true.
I
am
considering
-
You
know
what
I'm
talking
about.
When
did
teachers
become
That
would
be
when
everyone
I
don't
know
what
...with
documenting
...but
I
can
assure
you
"Roman
is
having
an
okay
day...
...and
bought
a
Coke
Zero
Raise
the
roof."
Who
gives
a
rat's
ass?
He
got
a
Coke
Zero
again?
That
Roman.
Incorrigible.
Listen,
whatever
this
little
act
I
really
think
you
should
consider
...for
going
the
extra
mile.
I'm
really
attempting
to
understand
-
...Hawthorne
wrote
about.
If
I
read
one
more
paper
...who
talks
about
how
hot
she
is
in
...or,
is
she
still
married
to
Why
don't
people
just
watch
I
know
you
read
the
book.
I
did.
Listen,
I
want
to
apologize
for
Truthfully,
and
I'll
deny
it
...I
wanted
to
be
cheering
I
don't
know
what
it
is
about
Nina.
I
hate
her.
I
won't
tell.
-
I'll
deny
it
if
you
do.
-
Bye-bye.
Stay
golden.
-
Hi,
Mrs.
Griffith.
A
is
for
"awesome".
Yeah.
I've
never
seen
that
girl
before.
That
does
not
surprise
me.
But
I'm
the
guidance
counselor.
Especially
the
ones
-
It's
good
to
see
you.
No,
stop.
We're
at
school.
-
Windows.
Do
me
a
favor,
though.
I
think
she's
going
through
That's
not
the
girl
It
is.
Oh,
okay.
Oh,
this'll
be
good.
That
snotty,
Jesus-freak
...has
been
bitching
They're
all
lies,
but
she
could
use
All
right.
Hey,
what
are
you
doing
-
You
won't
be
there?
I
have
an
after-school
session.
Well,
be
careful,
all
right?
It
was
a
butter
knife.
You
know,
-
All
right,
bye.
I'm
thinking
about
another
gateway.
Making
spaghetti.
-
That's
great.
Enjoy
eating
your
meat.
-
And
balls.
Sharpening
your
pencils?
Getting
them
nice
and
sharp?
Sharpening
them
up?
Look
at
you.
Sharpening
those
pencils.
-
God,
that's
sharp.
I...
Good
job.
Well,
the
reason
I
called
you
in
...sort
of,
you
know,
just
chat
You
know,
there
is
concern
Your
husband.
Olive,
you're
attempting
I'm
just
a
little
confused
Am
I
in
trouble?
Because,
pursuant
...my
hemline
has
never
been
No,
you're
not
in
trouble.
I
wanted
to
make
sure
you
knew...
...if
there's
something
...you
know,
you
can
trust
me.
If
I
open
up
to
you,
do
you
promise
Yeah.
I'm...
See?
That's
what
I
do.
I
mean,
I
have
a
reputation
Don't
you,
though?
All
right,
listen,
don't
tell
anyone
Here
you
go.
-
Here
you
go.
Oh,
you
really
do.
Here
you
go.
Here
you
go.
Okay?
I
just
don't
want
this
thing
you're
Olive,
do
what
you
gotta
do.
Okay?
Let
your
freak
flag
fly.
Just
make
sure
Listen,
Mrs.
Griffith,
I
really...
The
pill
is
not
100
percent
effective.
Ask
some
of
your
friends'
parents.
Thank
you
for
coming
in.
Can
you
just
send
in
the
next
person?
You're
up,
hoss.
Okay.
Go.
It's
all
right.
Everything's
gonna
be
okay.
Don't
you
think
it's
a
little
strange
-
...and
still
in
high
school?
...but
he
is
here
by
choice.
It's
his
choice
that
can't
pass
His
choice.
His?
His?
Capital
H?
If
God
wanted
him
to
graduate,
God
I'm
sorry.
Okay.
So
why
was
he
blubbering
Is
he
struggling
No,
you
insensitive
His
parents
are
Okay.
You
know,
...they
get
divorced,
you
know?
And
it's
important
to
remember
So
I
gotta
go.
But
they
go
to
our
church.
How
long
do
these
embraces
usually
-
Are
you
gonna
be
okay?
Mrs.
Griffith
is
amazing...
...and
she's
gonna
help
Micah,
See?
All
right,
that's
the
spirit.
Okay.
Wait.
Why
are
you
even
I
did
it.
I
got
through
to
you.
I'm
so
sorry
about
everything
I
said.
I
mean,
I
really
want
us
to
be
friends.
Absolutely.
And
for
a
day,
I
was
kind
of
starting
to
think
Olive!
-
Friend.
-
I
missed
you.
She
texted
me
in
first
period.
By
second
period,
Olive.
Olive.
Tragedy
struck
in
Wood
Shop.
It
wasn't
because
...which
has
happened.
Micah
is
in
the
hospital.
The
nurse
didn't
know
There,
there.
It
hurts
so
bad,
Mommy.
Well,
it's
just
what
I
thought.
No.
Who
have
you
been
screwing?
Tell
me
now
Olive.
Olive
Penderghast!
Olive.
Olive
Penderghast.
I
have
to
call
you
back.
Goddamn
it.
Chlamydia?!
That
bitch!
-
Olive?
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
my
God.
I
panicked.
I
said
I
got
it
I
know,
but
what
was
You
know,
and
then
my
mom
I
did.
I
tried
to
blame
it
...but
my
mom
is
not
buying
it.
That's
it.
I
have
to
tell
them.
No,
I
do
not
care
that
you
I
love
you
and
I
want
to
be
with
you,
Not
my
mother,
not
Marianne,
...or
the
president
of
the
Americas!
Oh,
God.
What?
What
do
you
want?
Just
go.
Perfect.
Just
perfect.
I'm
sorry,
I
just...
Did
she
say
anything
She
just
smacked
No,
that's
my
fault.
But
I
messed
up,
okay?
...goddamn
messed
up
Goddamn.
Shit,
goddamn.
Okay.
Don't
get
me
wrong
...but
I
just,
I
don't
think
you're
supposed
to
use
that
kind
You
know
what
else
you're
not
But
that
didn't
stop
me.
Wait.
You...
Oh,
my
God.
But
I'm
not...
I'm
not
judging
I...
Wait,
what
does
that
You
should
know
We
haven't
slept
together
In
months,
all
right?
Finally,
this
great-looking
guy
comes
And
he's
not
a
minor.
This
is
legal.
It's
legal
He's
not
the
sharpest
And
then
he
finds
out
And
so
then
he's
telling
He
didn't
want
me
...and
he
doesn't
wanna
get
in
trouble
I'm
sorry.
But
I'll...
I'm
gonna
fix
it,
Olive.
I'm
gonna
tell
everyone
that
it's
me.
And,
you
know,
whatever
else
I
lose,
Maybe
it
was
becoming
a
habit
...or
maybe
I
just
couldn't
stand
...my
favorite
teacher's
Either
way,
I
decided
to
help.
I
could
have
chlamydia.
I
mean,
I
could
have
easily
given
it
I
mean,
who
knows?
Women
oftentimes
And
the
whole
world
knows
No,
you
haven't.
No,
you
haven't.
Because
a
real
whore
can't
admit
it
Call
Micah.
Tell
him
he
is
an
ass
and
...tell
him
I
confessed
Getting
a
lot
of
hugs
today.
-
You're
going
to
hell,
Olive!
I
guess
I
shouldn't
be
too
shocked
...wanted
my
diseased
ass
Save
yourself,
Olive.
The
funny
thing
is,
the
whole
time
...I
couldn't
help
but
think
Although
you
gotta
love
That's
the
one
thing
Why
are
you
doing
this?
I'm
trying
to
make
this
school
Start
a
petition
to
get
rid
New
Honey
Chicken
at
Quiznos.
-
Not
now,
Quiznos.
You're
going
down,
Olive.
If
this
is
because
I'm
more
popular
Let's
not
mistake
popularity
-
You
don't
wanna
burn,
do
you?
Sorry.
-
You
okay?
Screw
all
these
people,
Olive.
Haven't
you
heard?
I
already
did.
-
You're
going
to
hell,
Olive!
You're
going
to
hell!
So
they
got
Rhiannon.
Never
underestimate
the
power
They
sense
any
weakness,
And
the
whack
pack
But
at
least
they
have
a
pack.
I
was
used
to
being
by
myself,
I
thought
I
should
look
into
what
they
-
Do
you
have
a
religion
section?
-
Can
I
help
you
with
something?
That's
in
bestsellers,
I
didn't
have
time
...because
it's,
like,
Single-spaced.
And
as
every
war
...there
are
many
ways
Except
the
Civil
War.
So
I
went
to
find
an
expert.
But
really,
I
just
kind
of
Forgive
me,
Father,
I
think
that's
how
you
I'm
just
going
off
Where
do
I
even
start?
I've
been
pretending
to
be...
What
is
the
Catholic
way
A
harlot?
A
harlot.
It's
not
that
...the
things
that
people
have
...but
then
again,
So
I
was
just
wondering,
It's
just
that
a
lot
of
people
...and
I
thought
it
was
okay
because
it
wasn't
real,
It
was
make-believe.
And
no
one
was
getting
hurt...
...but
a
lot
of
people
hate
me
now.
I
kind
of
hate
me
too.
I
might
be
wrong...
...but
aren't
you
Tell
me
to
say
10
Hail
Marys,
...advance
token
to
nearest
railroad?
Should've
seen
that
one
coming.
Luckily,
I
live
in
a
town
So
I
went
to
find
one
Can
I
help
you?
Yeah,
I
was
just
wondering
Is
it
not
a
minister?
A
Reverend?
A
wizard?
It's
a
pastor,
and
he's
here.
How
can
I
help
you
today?
I
was
wondering
what
your
church's
It's
not
a
good
thing.
Oh,
I
agree,
wholeheartedly.
Assuming
there
is
a
hell...
Oh,
the
Christian
Church
recognizes
Okay,
so
we'll
just
say
There
is.
Just
so
we're
clear.
-
Okay.
So
for
argument's
sake...
Right
below
our
feet,
Then
what
would
be
worse,
Or
is
lying
about
adultery
Come
on.
I'm
sorry,
I
didn't.
I...
You
know
what?
I'm
just
gonna
go
check
out
-
God.
Two
frames,
really?
The
Jews
and
I
-
Just
fashion-wise
and
stuff.
Yes,
I
had
unwittingly
...of
the
leader
of
my
lynch
mob.
What
other
complete
and
total
idiot
Okay,
I've
narrowed
it
down
...or
The
Bucket
List.
Huge
hit.
Why
can't
we
watch
a
movie
for
kids?
Because
the
Family
Member
Yeah,
but
you
get
Family
Member
And
there's
a
reason
for
that.
Yeah.
You
pick
Are
you
accusing
me
of
nepotism?
Okay,
it's
The
Bucket
List.
This
is
the
greatest
decision.
I'm
so
happy
with
this
decision.
All
right,
now,
honey,
...remember
to
cross
"Watch
Guys.
I
want
you
to
know
that
if
you
that
is
totally
false.
Olive,
do
we
need
No.
It's
just
a
thing
You
know,
nothing
you're
saying
Not
to
mention
how
you've
been
No
judgment,
-
Mom.
For
governors
or
athletes.
But
stripper,
nonetheless.
Oh,
my
God.
And
I
have
no
STDs,
I
promise
you.
Oh,
that's
great.
If
you
hear
anything
...come
up
with
some
funny
retort
Honey,
you're
kind
of
Should
we
be
kind
of
I
don't
think
so.
-
You
sure?
Yeah.
I
got
it
all
under
control.
-
Okay.
Then
let's
Bucket
List
this
bitch.
The
Bucket
List,
The
Bucket
List.
To
say
this
whole
thing
...would
be
I
actually
reread
The
Scarlet
Letter
And
it
turns
out
she
bore
...which
are
two
concepts
With
all
the
mythical
play
...I
still
actually
hadn't
been
People
were
jumping
up
and
down
...but
no
one
bothered
I
was
starting
to
think
I
actually
-
Until
finally...
Hey,
Anson.
What's
up?
I
was
wondering
Maybe
wanna
go
out
or
something?
What
did
you
have
in
mind?
I
was
thinking
about
getting
...bringing
along
some
champagne...
...and
then
possibly
reading
Or
we
could
just
go
...because
it's,
you
know,
-
I
love
The
Lobster
Shack.
Okay.
It's
a
date,
then.
-
Okay.
So
should
I
still
bring
No,
we
could
stick
our
heads
...if
we
run
out
of
things
That
was...
-
Cool.
All
right.
Well...
You
look
really
beautiful.
Thank
you.
-
You're
a
real
gentleman.
Just
a
guy
having
dinner
Do
you
believe
this
whole
thing
I
did
not
know
it
was.
Medical
science
really
...that
any
particular
food
increases
...but
guys
just
spend
and
spend
...they
think
is
gonna
get
them
lucky.
...what
is
sexy
about
Did
you
know
some
people
actually
...because
it's
thought
to
increase
That's
not
true
at
all.
Spanish
fly.
Spanish
fly.
-
Yes.
Pulverized
blister
beetle.
What?
And
it's
illegal
in
the
U.S..
Because
if
you
eat
...it
causes
painful
urination,
-
Am
I
talking
too
much?
You're
just
burning
through
Shouldn't
have
had
coffee
I'm
just
kidding.
Your
Maine
lobster
-
I'm
jealous.
Let's
dig
in.
Right?
I
didn't
know
Woodchuck
Todd
He's
dressed
like
a
lobster.
I
should
start
calling
him
Shit.
-
Shit,
shit,
shit.
-
Rhiannon's
over
there.
She's
been
in
love
with
you
-
She's
my
best
friend.
But
that
doesn't
mean
Or
that
I
should
be
out
with
you.
Rhi
and
I
don't
have
-
And
you
and
I
do?
-
Like
what?
If
that's
our
connection,
Haven't
you?
No.
No,
I
haven't.
Okay,
she
can't
see
us.
Can
you
just...?
Excuse
me?
Hi.
I
just
remembered
I
forget
that
my
respiratory
system
-
I
have
a
gift
certificate.
I'm
sorry,
but
we
have
to
go.
-
Go.
Go.
Come
on.
Go,
go,
go.
I'm
sorry
about
that.
I've
got
something
for
you.
Two
hundred
dollars
I
didn't
realize
this
was
a...
I
know
it
sounds
kind
of
lame,
but
they
I
bought
my
air
compressor
there.
So,
what
did
we
do
on
this
date?
Whatever
200
bucks
gets
me.
-
That's
not
really
how
it
works.
Stop.
I'm
not
really
having
sex
with
people
I'm
saying
I'm
having
sex
for
money,
It's
okay.
-
Stop.
No,
no.
Stop!
Come
on,
just
relax.
God.
Asshole.
What
are
you
doing?
Now
you
didn't.
Come
on,
this
is
bullshit.
Goddamn
it.
Hey,
Olive.
Todd,
hi.
-
Hey,
you
all
right?
Like
a
twig,
you
know,
or
a
branch,
I
didn't
know
I
don't,
which
is
why
Olive,
hey.
Do
you
wanna
talk
about
it?
What's
to
say?
...and
for
the
first
time,
What?
Don't
act
like
you
don't
know
I
know
what
people
are
saying.
-
Who
told
you?
No
one
had
to
tell
me
that
once
upon
...at
a
party
in
a
dark
room
And,
you
know,
there
was
I
still
can't
believe
You
know,
sometimes
I
pretend
-
Yeah?
-
Who
was?
-
What?
Yeah,
it
was...
I
think
it
was,
like,
It
sucked,
by
the
way.
That
bitch.
Oh,
my
God,
-
How
do
you
feel
about
me?
That's
just
perfect.
Wait,
hold
on
a
second.
"Felt."
I
said
"felt".
Because
I
thought
I...
-
No,
it
was
"felt".
How
do
you
know
where
I
live?
We
used
to
carpool.
Yeah,
in
2nd
grade.
What,
are
you
Just
for
people
who
I
think
are
cool.
-
You
think
I'm
cool?
And
I
think
you're
pretty
and
smart.
Did
you
form
this
opinion
Way
prior.
Why
didn't
that
rumor
spread?
I
like
to
keep
my
business
Notoriety,
for
whatever
reason...
...never
seems
to
benefit
the
noted,
Where
were
you
two
weeks
ago?
Olive.
If
I
promise
not
to
tell
anyone,
No.
-
Okay.
Okay.
I'm
sorry.
I
just
mean,
not
like
this.
I
don't
wanna
kiss
you
with
mascara
...and
some
horndog
guy
...to
stick
his
tongue
I've
wanted
to
kiss
you
...but
I
want
it
to
be
perfect.
And
right
now,
my
life
is
a
mess.
I
need
to
get
my
business
in
order
What
if
I
told
you
I
could
help,
maybe.
Why
now?
Why
are
you
all
of
a
sudden
I
don't
know.
I
haven't
overanalyzed
it,
-
Good
night,
Olive.
Now
that
I
knew
there
were
decent
...the
lies
had
to
stop.
I
knew
there
was
only
to
set
the
story
straight:
Brandon.
I'd
helped
him,
and
even
though
...as
a
straight
stud,
Oh,
my
God.
Did
you
hear
that
Yeah,
totally.
He
left
his
parents
...and
then
he
skipped
town
My
apologies
to
Mark
Twain.
-
Wait,
huh?
-
You
said
something.
You
said
something,
-
You're
funny.
Okay.
I
went
to
everyone
I'd
helped
No
way.
I
gave
you
money.
You
gave
me
a
gift
card
to
AutoZone.
I
thought
it'd
be
aspirational.
Evan,
please
do
this
for
me,
all
right?
I
don't
want
people
to
know
Do
you
know
how
many
girls
Girls
are
almost
as
dumb
as
boys.
Oh,
yes,
they
are.
It
gets
worse.
"Honor
your
father
Due
to
his
condition,
Micah
was
sent
...in
Palatka,
Florida.
And
if
there's
one
thing
worse
"...be
guilty
of
adultery."
Get
your
hands
Olive,
life
is
full
of
choices.
I
made
a
bad
one.
But
I
see
no
other
alternative
My
guilt
stems
from
my
indiscretion
We
made
our
choices.
Or
I
could
just
tell
everyone
the
truth
Okay,
first
of
all,
he
is
of
age,
okay?
It's
perfectly
legal
I
checked.
He
is
21
in
eight
months.
And
secondly,
let's
play
the
Who
Why
don't
you
ask
yourself,
if
you
Who
would
you
believe?
Who
would
you
believe?
Who?
Thank
you
for
coming
in.
Yeah,
Mrs.
Griffith
was
pure
evil,
but
Your
wife
has
chlamydia,
...and
she
gave
it
to
him,
What?
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
Mr.
Griffith,
...just
know
that
I
was
wrong
I
shouldn't
have
done
it.
And
I
don't
even
feel
bad
But
I
hate
myself
for
telling
you
With
my
words,
even
though
Looking
back,
that's
the
thing
So
now
everyone
that
knows
the
truth
And
Marianne
Bryant
and
her
The
messed-up
thing
is
I
would
not
put
I
had
a
similar
situation
What?
Everyone
called
you
a
slut?
I
had
a
horrible
reputation
and
-
Why?
I
slept
with
a
whole
bunch
of
people.
-
Mom.
Before
I
met
Dad,
Do
me
a
favor
and
just
stuff
this
down
-
It's
true.
It
is.
It's
true.
I
could
do
this
thing.
I
could
go...
Stop.
Can
you
stop?
-
Can
you
not
see
that
I'm
a
mess?
You're
wonderful.
And
you'll
handle
this
With
an
incontrovertible
But
you're
much
smarter
...so
you'll
come
out
of
this
Thank
you,
Mom.
-
I
could
get
my
leg
so
far
back.
So
it
was
time
to
put
an
end
...by
telling
my
side
And
that's
why
I
decided
So
here
we
go.
Part
five.
Not
with
a
fizzle,
but
with
a
bang.
Today
we
had
yet
another
Todd
convinced
the
band
to
play
I
needed
to
pique
everyone's
interest
I
had
one
outfit
left
and
I
figured
Plus
I
really
wanted
...for
no
apparent
reason.
Is
that
Olive?
This
was
just
a
free
preview.
For
the
main
event,
log
on
to
And
I
know
it
interferes
with
...would
you
rather
cheer
on
...or
watch
me
do
one?
What
do
you
think
you're
doing?
I
can't,
because
I
have
a
date
with
the
I
think
before
you
expel
me,
you
might
wanna
talk
...because
I
think
she
might
Go,
Woodchucks!
And
here
you
all
are...
...waiting
outside
the
bedroom
door
...listening
to
me
pretend
...paying
me
to
lie
for
you...
...and
calling
me
You
know,
it
was
just
like
Hester
Except
that's
the
one
thing
How
shitty
it
feels
to
be
an
outcast.
How
did
you
know
I
love
this
song?
I
guessed.
I
see
you've
been
watching
my
live
Screw
them.
They've
had
I
borrowed
my
neighbor's
mower.
That
almost
rhymed.
I
know.
I
spent
a
minute
on
it.
I'll
be
right
down.
That's
Todd.
Not
that
I
owe
you
guys
but
I
really
like
this
guy...
...and
I
might
even
lose
my
virginity
I
don't
know
when
it'll
happen.
You
know,
it
might
be
five
minutes
...or
six
months
from
now
But
the
really
amazing
thing
is,
Come
on,
where's
she
going?
I
thought
she
was
going
Demi
Moore
took
her
clothes
off.
Come
on.
Are
you
kidding
me?
-
Piss
off.
Jack?
That's
a
mighty
snug
I
judge
it's
all
right.
Here,
Jim,
I'll
take
my
turn
No,
that's
all
right,
Huck.
Blue
Devils!
