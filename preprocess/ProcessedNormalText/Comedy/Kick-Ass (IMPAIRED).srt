C'mon.
Be
honest
with
yourself.
At
some
point
in
our
lives,
we
all
wanted
to
be
a
super
hero.
That's
not
me,

I?
I'm
"Kick-Ass"
That's

Back
before
any

I
was
the
last
person
you'd
expect
to
become
a
superhero
Not
saying
there
was
anything
wrong
But
there's
not
nothing
special

I
wasn't
into

I
wasn't
a

I
didn't
have
a
piercing,
or

My
only
superpower
was
being
invisible

girls
And

of
my

I
wasn't
even
the

to
be

I

Yes,

if
you
were

...You're
outta

In
the

the

epiphany
I
had
was
realizing
that,
Did
they
change

No
How
come
nobody's
ever
tried
to

I
dunno.
Probably

I
thought

Yeah,
Todd,
that's
what
I
meant.
Dude
if
anybody
did
it
in
real
life
They'd
be
dead
in
like,
a
day.
O.K.,
I'm
not
saying
they
should
do
it.
I
just
cant
figure
out
why
nobody
Seriously,
out
of
all
the
millions
of
people
who
love
superheroes
you'd
think
Jesus,
guys.
Doesn't
it

you?
Why
do
thousands
of

what's
with
that?

I
feel
like
I'm
gonna
start
crying.
No,
the
fact
that
he's..
..always
on
his
own.
We
should,
like,
talk
to
him.
See
if
he
wants
to
hang
with
us.
...I'm
not
saying
that
we
should
talk
to
him,

about

You

When
did
you
ever
kick
anyone's
ass?
Whatever,

called
it
preparation.
But
if
you
called
it
fantasizing,
it
woulda
been
hard
to
argue.
All
I
knew
was
I
never
felt
so
good
about
myself.
Fuck!
Okay,

Ass
Dude

gotta
check
this
shit

is
it?
And
coming
up
after
the
hour:
a
costumed
vigilante
has
become
the
latest
Internet
phenomenon
after
a
This
is
awesome
Fuck
Yeah.
Welcome
to
this
special
edition
How
far
would
you
go
to
help
your
fellow
man?
This
colorful
individual
has
been
all
over
the
news
this
week
After
this
video
of
his
intervention
of
street
gang
violence
became
the
most
watched
clip
on
the
Internet
My
Space...
38
friends
Kick-Ass'
My
Space...
16000
and
counting.
This
thing
was
going
crazy
And
I
was
loving
it
And
finally,
we
want
to
know
who
is
this
man
Does
anyone
have
any
He
must
be
someone's
son...
Someone's
Holy
shit.
What
happened?
what
happened?
This
guy
happened.
That's
a
great
day
for
America
everybody
Everbody's
favorite
superhero
right
now
is
Kick-Ass,
right?
Kick-Ass!
Yeeaah!
I
like
Kick-Ass
His
costume
is
crappy
He
looks
like
a
trans...
You
know
what?
Everyone
likes
Kick-Ass
He...is
actually
pretty
good.?
Good
at
getting
his
Ass-Kicked.
He
should
call
himself
Ass-Kick,
instead
That
doesn't
even
make
any
sense.
That
guy's
gonna
end
up
dead
that's
what
I
think.
Are
you
serious?
The
guy
owns.
I'd
be
next
if
I
had
a
problem
needed
fixing.
What
you
kidding
me?
I
have
100
guys
can
fix
a
problem.
Well,
I
wouldn't
wanna
get
in
the
way
of
your
business...
where
I'm
not
wanted.
Please,
I
know
you
are
mistaking
me
for
Kick-Ass,
but
I
am
not
Kick-Ass.
You
don't
actually
read
comics?
Yeah,
I
just
started.
I
got
recommended
some.
Like
Scott
Pilgrim
and...?
That
kind
of
thing.
I'm
not
really
into
the
whole
superheroes
thing,
you
know.
So...
guess
you're
not
gonna
be
lining
up
for
I
guess
not.
You
know
what,
I
was
seriously
thinking
of
mailing
his
site?
I
mean
I
could
really
use
some
help
from
a
guy
like
that
right
now.
Help?
Really?
What
with?
You
know
I
volunteer
at
the
No,
I
didnt.
Well,
there's
this
one
guy,
more
I
found
out
about
his
up
bringing
and
stuff
I
just...
Wow,
that's
weird
I'm
usually
the
one
playing
therapist.
Can
I
make
a
confession?
Ever
since
I
was
little
I've
always
wanted
a
...like...
you.
Is
it
okay
to
say
that?
I
mean
its
no
homophobic,
is
it?
I
mean
I
don't
think
you're
all
the
Of
course
not.
No.
Thank
you
I
don't

...Hey

that's
a
very
bad
thing
you're

now..
Really
nasty
individuals...
Let
me
go,
Hey...
Come

please..
hey..
stop!

please!
What
a
douche.
You've
done
a
self
tan
before,
right?
Yeah,
I
do
it
all
the
time.
Murder.
Superheroes
breaking
into
my
bedroom.
Even
with
the
good
parts,
were
totally
surreal
Oh
hey,
I
read
those
old
Ditko
Spider-Mans
Yeah,
they
are.
And
it's
been
a
whole
week
since
I've
heard
from
Rasul.
That's
great.
Once
upon
a
time,
there
were
two
super
cops
called
who
were
very
good
at
getting
bad
guys
Frank
Damico
was
the
baddest
guy
of
them
all
Being
framed
as
drug
dealer
was
the
worst
possible
thing
Prison
was
not
his
natural
habitat
He
was
very
upset.
With
Daddy
in
prison
And
could
not
cope.
But
all
clouds
have
a
silver
lining.
And
out
of
her
death..
Mindy
was
born
Marcus
became
the
child's
guardian
And
Daddy
started
a
plan
of
his
very
own.
Five
years
later
he
left
prison
And
he
was
ready
Now
it's
time
for
Mindy
to
get
ready
too.
How'd
you
find
me
Marcus?
One
of
us
is
still
a
cop,
remember?
Now
you
brain-washed
Mindy?
You
say
brain-washed
What
you
call
this?
Playing,
Damon?
So
where
is
she?
She's
safe
-
I
miss
her,
I
miss
you
both.
I
appreciate
your
concern.
But
you
need
to
go
now.
I
should
warn
you
that
asshole,
He
got
something
to
do
with
you
Damon?
You
started
some
kinda
fucked-up
Never
heard
of
him
Ok,
well
heads
up,
alright?
You
keep
carrying
on
like
you've
been
carrying
on
and
it's
He's
been
on
Frank
D'Amicos
payroll
ever
since
you
You
know
I'm
not
gonna
stop.
Not
'til
D'Amico
and
his
whole
damn
And
buried.
It
ain't
gonna
bring
her
back,
Damon.
This
is
not
the
life
for
Mindy,
You
owe
that
kid
a
childhood.
I'll
tell
you
who
owes
her
a
Frank
D'Amico
Holy
shit
I
don't
fuckin'
believe
it.
Follow
him.
Around
the
corner.
Not
too
fast
He's
doing
the
high
fives.
I'll
give
'em
a
motherfuckin'
high
five.
High
five
and
bullshit
Keep
going,
keep
going.
Not
too
close
He's
going
into
the
alley
He's
going
to
the
alley
Okay,

I
tell
you
stop
the
car.
Ready?
Hey
Kick-Ass
How

Kill

you
looking
at?
Huh?
Come

He

so
young
Who

get
to
die
that
way?
Oh,

it?

Okay

this,
but
It

this
What

Spider-Man
party?
Sure.

Since

you
Fucks

that's
when.
Hey

not.
Kick-Ass
is
just
some
geek!
You
don't
have
to
worry
about
him
You
need
to
watch
this!
Why?
What
does
it
do?
You're
fucking
kidding
me
What?
-
What
are
you
doing?
You
bought
this
to
spy
on
the
nanny
Why?
You
put
it
in
the
warehouse?
Yeah.
I
thought
it'd
be
cool
to
put
the

"Let's
get
the
tag?
he's
on
his
way"
Who
the
hell
is
this
guy?
I
don't
know,
Dad
But,
Kick-Ass
told
me
we're
not
the
only
super
heroes
in
town.
I
want
this
place
locked
down.
Nobody
comes
in,
nobody
goes
out
Not
until
somebody
finds
this
cocksucker
Listen.
They're
on
to
you.
I
thought
they
were
looking
for
Not
anymore.
Gigante
just
put
on
a
little
movie
In
a
warehouse
killing
a
whole
I'm
gonna
take
a
wild
guess
that
was
you?
-
I
killed
all
the
cameras.
Look
bro,
you
need
to
get

Hide
yourself
Appreciate
it.

X-
Men,
Fantastic
4
Right
now
I
can't
beat
the
crap
out
of
them.
Everything
was
out
of
control
I
didn't
know
what
the
hell
to
do
You
OK,
buddy?
You
look
tired
Gonna
have
an
early
night
tonight,
maybe?
And
there
was
no
one
I
could
talk
to
about
it
Hello
Yeah...
I
will.
I
never
felt
more
alone
I've
always
dreamed
of
being
a
super
hero
But
this...
was
a
nightmare
It
was
time
to
stop
wearing
this
stupid
costume
But
there
was
one
last
thing
I
needed
it
for
What's
the
difference
between
Spider-Man
and
Peter
Parker?
Spider-Man
gets
the
girl

I'm
Kick
Ass
You
e-mailed
me.
Please...
Oh...
Fuck!
Oh
Fuck!
Fuckin'
freak
in
a
mask-fuck!
Get
out
of
my
house
I'm
not
gonna
No,
no,
it's
me
I
was
only
trying
to
surprise
you
Sorry
-
Why
are
you
dressed
as
Kick-Ass?
Because
I
am
Kick-Ass.
What
are
you
talking
about?
And
I'm
also
not
gay.
Fuck!
And
I
know
I've
been
an
idiot,
Oh
my
God!
-
I
know
and
if
it
makes
you
feel
any
better,
I
I
hate
myself.
Please
I'm...
Look,
I'm
really
really
sorry
I've
never
met
anybody
who
was
as
and...
lovely
as
you.
You
deserve
better.
Dave
Yes
My
mom
has
the
burglar
alarm
set
downstairs.
Or
You
could
just
stay.
stay?
Like
when
we
have
a
sleepover?
I'm
sorry,
I
didn't
mean
to
scare
you
We
gotta
get
over
the
top
of
it
and
then
into
it
right
in
the
middle
of
her.
Daddy,
I
think
I
found
one.
It's
perfect.
And
they
can
deliver
it
in
And
it's
three
Can
you
think
of
anything
else
that
is
cool!
Yeah.
Add
to
shopping
cart
OK
Out
of
Kickass
and
Red
Mist,
who
do
Why
are
they
fighting?
What
do
you
think?
I
don't
know.
But
I
think
Kick-Ass
is
Really?
I,
for
one,
would
definitely
fuck
his
You
would?
Definitely.
Do
you...
uh,
feel
like
checking
out
she's
like
a
shoe
designer
kind
of
guy?
I
think
we
can
make
the
next
Hell
yeah.
I
guess
we're
not
invited
Alright..
you
know
what,
come
here
I'm
going
to
request
a
great
meal
for
you
right
now
Suddenly,
I
understood
why
super
heroes
only
exist
in
the
comics
I
doubt
why
people
didn't
risk
their
life
for
strangers
because,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
had
something
to
worth
living
for
Something
to
lose
Katie
was
worried
about
me
getting
so
I
promised
her
my
Kick-Ass
And
the
truth
was,
I
hardly
missed
it
at
all.
I
hadn't
even
checked
Ok...
I'm
off
then.
No
Katie
tonight?
Tomorrow.
Wednesdays
she
does
one
You
seem
like
a
different
guy,
you
Your
mom
would've
been
so
happy
to
Have
a
good
night
Hey,
baby
-
I
gotta
do
that
Kick-Ass
thing
What?
I
thought
you
were
done
with
that?
This
is
the
last
time.
I
totally
I
worry
about
you
I
wish
you
wouldnt
worry.
I
can't
help
it.
I
do.
Because
I...
I...
care
about
you
a
lot.
I...
care
about
you
a
lot,
too.
This
better
be
serious,
Dude,
because
How
about
both
of
us
being
dead?
Dead?
How?
Well
it
turns
out
those
dead
guys
from
the
warehouse
had
some
bad
motherfuckers
for
friends
There's
a
price
on
our
heads,
man.
A
price
on
our
heads?
What
is
this,
They
found
out
where
I
lived!
They
trashed
my
placed!
Shit
What
do
we
do?
Remember
you
mentioned
that
there
were
other
super
heroes
Yeah.
Well,
do
you
think
they
can
help
us?
Hot
chocolate,
extra
Marsh-mellows.
Oah.
That
looks
even
cooler
than
in
the
picture
Child
You
know
because
in
the
picture
Nice
job.
I'm
gonna
take
my
new
bed,
Okay?
Okay,

doll.
Sleep
tight

Oh,
Kick-Ass?
Mmh
You
go
get
dressed
I'I
tell
him
to
meet
us
at
safehouse
B
We'll
have
our
hot-chocolate
when
we
get
back.
Okay
daddy.
C'mon.
Here
we
go.
Do
you
know
where
that
is?
No.
But
I'll
just
put
it
in
the
GPS.
Alright,
let's
go
Shit
Well
Here
you
are,
and
Red
Mist,
too.
Pleasure
to
meet
you.
Good

Shit!

He's

me!...
Let

Get

here,
get
the
fuck
outta
here
Hotdamn,
I
always
wanted
one
of
these...
Seriously
you're
gonna
take
that?
Yes.
You
know
what
being
a
super
hero
actually
costs?
You
happen
to
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
here.
Kick-Ass!-
Kick
Ass
I'm
sorry
Get
in
there
You
better
fire
this
asshole!
Ignore
him.
A
Bazooka?
OK
We
had
a
deal,
dad.
We
had
a
fucking
deal
All
I'm
asking
is
you
let
Kick-Ass
go!
He
didn't
do
Chris,
you
gotta
look
at
this
from
my
point
of
view.
Okay?
I
gotta
send
a
public
service
that
being
a
superhero
is
And
the
big
motherfucker?
Nobody
knows
who
he
is.
Yeah,
but
that's
not
fair!
Life's
not
fair,
kid.
Get
over
it.
What
are
you
gonna
do
with
them?
You
really
want
to
be
a
part
of
my
business?
Yeah.
Then
sit
down,
shut
up
and
watch.
Frank,
we're
ready
Enjoy

that

internet

are
predicting
Hey,

Dave?
Hey
have
you

noticed

obviously.
Why
else
would
I
be

With
no

like
this...
Ba-ton
We
have
some
of
Kick-Ass'

For

It's
also
good
for
hittin'
balls.
We
don't
do
'em
individually,
we
do
'em
all
together.
Gentlemen

Yeah.
Oh
this

very
painful...
Due

I
think
I'm
in
love
with
her,
dude.
She
looks
like
she's
about
11
years
old,
but...
I
can
wait.
I
solemnly
vow
to
save
myself
for
her.
I
can
see
that
this
can
be
really
difficult
for
you.
Are
you
OK?
Yeah.
Whoa
Good
job.
I'm
so
proud
of
you,
baby
doll
Are
you
OK?
Yes
Getting
shot,
daddy,
hurt
a
lot
more
than
when
you
did
it.
That's
because
I
used
low-velocity
rounds,
child.
You're
the
kindest
daddy
in
the
whole
world
I

I
love
you

just
need
to

think?
Woah.

pajamas
and
clothes

stuff.
You
can't
take
that
stuff
to
my
house.
You
know
what
my
dad
would
have
really
He
would
have
wanted
me
to

exactly
what
I'm
gonna
do.

Frank
D'Amico's
place?
All
that
security
Are
you
crazy?
My
mom

Kick-Ass
was
gone,
And
my
world
is
much
safer
They
said
I

But
all
I
did
was
make
a
door
into
a
world
A
world
full
of
super
heroes,
huh?
like
a
great
man
once
said...
Wait'll
