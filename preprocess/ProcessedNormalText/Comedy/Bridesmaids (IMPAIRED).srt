Yeah.
I'm
not
looking
for
a
relationship
Whatever
you
wanna...
I'd
rather
just...
I
like
simple...
I'm
not
like,
"Be
my
boyfriend!"
Then
I'd
be
like,
Mmm.
But
let's
not.
I
don't
want

Head
to
toe.
But,
sadly,
Well,
I

But
I
just
think,
personally,
I
mean...
HELEN:
This
is
one
of
a

I
don't
think
No.
No

There
might
be

I
might...
I
think

a
great
color.
It's

It
doesn't
matter
to
me.
I
just
Oh,

Okay.
Everybody

outside.
There
is
a
bathroom
I
think
everybody
Shit!

I
need
the
toilet!

I
need
the
toilet!

You
ate
a
lot
of
Was
it
that?
No.
I'm...
I...
I
feel
fine.
I
think
you'd
just
feel
I
don't
have...

I
am
so
sorry.
Get
away
from
me!
You're
not
sick?
No.
In
fact,
Helen,
I'm
hungry.
And
I
wish
I
had
a
snack.
You're
hungry?
I'm
starving.
What
did
we
eat?
The
sink
is
a
goner.
It's
coming
out

Don't
you

Hmm?
Jordan

That
was
fun.

You
know
what
I
was
thinking?
You
should
come
with
me
Not
like
that.
But
just
like
We
can
get
dressed
up,
It'll
be
fun,
right?
No.
I
mean,
to
all
those
people
That
would
suck
for
you.
Yeah.
I
guess
so.
I'm
just
thinking
of
you.
No,
it's
okay.
I
have
someone
else

Really?
Who?
Umm...
George
Glass.
Okay.
Who
is
this
George?
He
is
a
very
hot,
nice
guy
who
likes
me
a
lot,
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

Well,

me
ask
you
this.
Can

feel
so
bad

a
Colonial
woman
There's
a
woman
on
the
wing.
There's

Steve.
There's
a
Colonial
woman.
She
was
churning

Who
is
she?
Just

me
make
it
I'm
telling
you,

I
have
so
many
ideas.
I
want
to
talk
to
I
feel
like
it
has
been
really
It's
just
starting
No,
Lil,
I'm
fine.
Lil,
I'm
fine.
No,
you're
not
fine.
You
are
not
fine,
Annie,
and
we
need
things
to
just
flow
smoothly
from
now
on
and
Helen
just
knows
She
does
it
all
the
time.
She
is
good
at
it.
This
way
you
don't
have
to
plan
any
more
You
don't
have
to
do
anything

it.
I
think
it'll
be
for
the
shower
Yeah,
I
mean,
I
think
so,
right?
Yeah.
I
think
that
will
make
me
happy.
Okay.
Good.

I
feel
like
her
and
getting
perfect,
It
will
turn
around,
I
have
been
hearing
It's
going
to
turn
around.
Anyway.
You
got
to
bake.
I
don't
really
do
Why?
I
don't
know,

after
it
just
went
under,
stopped,
I
guess.
It
doesn't
make
Just
because
you
didn't
doesn't
mean
that
I
lost
a
lot
of
money.
All
my
money.
But
you
are
so
good
at
it.
Oh,
well.
No
more
baking.
I
don't
know
how
If
I
wasn't
a
cop
anymore,

Really?
There
is
something
Something
about
ANNIE:
I
hate
buttons.
Where
is
the
bedroom?

Sorry.
It's

like
mountain
biking?

this
off.
I'm
so
glad
So

I.

Hello.
Sorry,
I
didn't
No,
it's
okay.
I
haven't
been
sitting
here
that
long.

Sorry,
I
guess
I
fell
asleep.
I
didn't
mean
to
sleep
over.
Don't
be
silly.
I
made
you
a
cappuccino.
Made
it?
So,
last
night
was
fun.
It
was.
