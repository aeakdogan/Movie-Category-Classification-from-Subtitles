I

I
have
a

here.
Using

spoons,
we
dig
and
release
it
into

Spoons.
That's
it,
I'm
out
of
ideas.
We're
closed.
Too
expensive.
Too
conspicuous.
Enormous
wooden

No
plan.
No
plan.
Can't
think.
Flatlining.
Uh,
Mike?
I
think
she's
getting
tired.
Well,
then
find
someplace
While
I
think
of
a
plan!
Are
you
sleepy?
You
want
to
sleep?
Is
that
what
you
want?
Huh?

Okay,
all
right.
I'm
making
a
nice

No.
Hey,
hey,
You're
going
to

:
My

is

What?

It's
just
a
closet.
Will
you
go
to
sleep?
Hey,
that
looks
like
Randall.
Randall's
your
monster.
You
think
he's
going
and
scare
you.
Oh,
boy,
Uh,
it's
empty.
-See?
No
monster
in
here.
Well,
now
there
is

I'm
not
going
to

you.
I'm
off-duty.
Okay.
How
about
I
sit
here,
Go
ahead.
Go
to
sleep.
Now.
Now...
go.
Uh,
you...
go...
to...
sleep.




Hey,
Mike,
but
I
don't
think
Really?
Well,
in
that
case,
I
always
wanted

Mike,
think
about
it.
If
we
send
her

Everything
goes
back
to

Is
that
a
joke?
Tell
me
you're
joking.
Sulley,
I'd
like
to
think
I
have
been
extremely
but
that
is
a
horrible
idea!
