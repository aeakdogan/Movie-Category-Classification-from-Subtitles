right.
An
extension
cord
PHIL:
falls
right
around

the
way,
He's
one
of
those
kids,
and
all
he
wants
to
do
Yeah,
one
year

really
nice
box.
And
we
made
the
mistake
So
he
played

W-we
can't
get
it
right.
I
feel
terrible.
Oh,

anyone?
Really?
So,

late
'30s,
You

what?
We
haven't
Maybe
a
clown
Cameron,
Cameron,
wanted
to
get
Luke
a
clown,
This
is
not
our
party.

But--
But--

What
would
you
suggest
Get
him
a
gift
card.

A
gift
card?
Who
hurt
you?
Hey,
Gloria,

to
wrap
one
Is
that
a
crossbow?
Yeah.
Am
I
the
greatest
grandpa
We
can't
give
Luke
He
pokes
himself
in
the
eye
Are
you
kidding?
My
dad
used
to
give
me
a
quarter
And
I
used
to
have
a
machete,
He'll
be
fine.
Hey,
pal.
-
Am
I
charming?
Of
course
you're
charming.
No
one,
but
there
is
and
I
want
her
I
need
your
advice,
Jay.
Really?
She's
gonna
be

I
mean,
you
don't
usually
Well,
this
is
one
area
in
which
He
has
a
point.
I've
tried
everything
Opening
doors,
having
a
milk
Nothing
has
worked.
Here's
the
deal.
Girls
don't
go
They
go
for
power
And
since
you
don't
have
you're
gonna
be
No,
no,
I-I
want
the
most
dangerous
I
have
an
iguana
That'd
be
scary
if
it
was
Seriously,
Jungle
Tanya,
I
need
you
to
step
it
up
Is
there
anything
that
scares
Uh,
not
really.
I
do
have
-
Ooh.
Does
it--
Well,
then,
we're
back

I
couldn't
get
Luke
I
know
I
made
a
promise
but
some
things
Fizbo
would
be
Hello,
old
friend.
It
all
happened
I
keep
thinking
there
was
Oh,
don't
blame
yourself.
Who
could
have
Sweetie,
Is
that
even
safe?
Honey,
relax.
Hey,
has
anyone
ever
gotten
hurt
I
don't
know,
man.
See?
They
wouldn't
let
the
new
-
That
did
not
make
me
feel
better.
like
a
hundred
releases.
When
did
we
decide
all
this?
See,
I
knew
you'd
say
that.
So
just
relax.
-
There's
a
snow-cone
machine?
Mom,
just
so
you
know,
That's
random.
Uh,
'cause
he's
coming
Is
that
Yes,
because
she
can't
go
without
her
boyfriend's
tongue
It's
like
he's
feeding
Don't
be
so
jealous.
I'm
sure
you'll
meet
someone
-
Girls.
So,
what
you
got
there?
Oh,
these
are
supplies
I
finally
figured
out
Kids
bored?
I'm
teasing.
It
looks
good.
Comb
sheaths.
I
know,
I
know.
But
we
made
them
at
Donna
Rigby's
At
first,
we
thought
and
then
we
had
How
could
you
not?
You
combined
the
two
things
Combs
and
sheaths.
I'm
kidding!
Where's
my
comb?
Oh,
here
it
is,
in
my
incredibly
convenient
that
I
made
at
Luke's
Hole
in
one,
Mrs.
Dunphy.
I'm
home.
I
got
Luke
a
video
game,
so...
guess
we're
Cam?
Don't
be
mad.
Oh...
Cam,
I...
I've
known
I
wanted
since
I
found
out
clowns
Um,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
I
wasn't
in
school
There
are
four
types
A
tramp,
an
auguste,
I
am
a
classically
trained
-
What?
Between
the
clownin'
I'm
surprised
you
had
time
Oh,
and
there's
the
fifth
type,
The
sad
clown
So
there's
still
Okay.
Cam,
I
thought
We
did,
And
this
isn't
This
is
about
a
little
boy
And
he's
gonna
get
that
Fizbo
is
not
gay,

Ah.
is
to
bring
people
joy
and
He's--
he's
the

Excellent.
Thank
you.
Hey,
buddy.
Yeah,
CLAIRE:
Hey,
Luke!
Luke,

you
want
to
make
A
what?
It's
a
cool
leather
holder
And
you
can
decorate
it.
I've
got
beads
and--
and--
and
all
kinds
of
stuff.
Do
you
want
to?
Nah,
I'm
gonna
do
Okay,

me
know
I'll
make
a
quick
run
Aah!

Seriously,
zip-line
guys,
Did
you
remember
to
switch
Oh,
no,
I
forgot.
They're
gonna
smell
musty.
I
know.
I'm
sorry.
-
I'll
pump.
You
just
stay
right
here
Oh,
I
get
it.
You're
worried
Without
question.
You
know,
They're
not
used
to
seeing
That's
her--
She's
so
cute.
Yeah,
and
she
has
She's
the
complete
package.
You
don't
need
luck.
You
just
remember
those
jokes
-
We
have
to
stop
meeting
like
this.
-
We
go
to
school
together.
Do
you
like
jokes?
Sure.
Great.
Okay.
So,
a
grasshopper
named
Gary
Oh,

Interrupting
cow.
Moo.
Oh,

Um,
hey.
Move.
You
kind
of
just
bumped
me
I
don't
think
so.
No,
no,
you
did,
see,
yeah,
and
then
also
I
felt
it.
Call
an
ambulance.
Okay,
I
just
thought
in
case
you
wanted
to
be
and
apologize,
Ass.
What
did
you
say?
Just
forget
Listen,
carrot
top,
so
do
the
smart
thing--
Shut
your
hole,
get
in
your
car,
Is
there
a
problem
here?
What
the
hell
are
you?
I'm
the
ass-kicking
clown
that'll
twist
you
I
will
beat
your
head
until
the
airbags
deploy,
so
apologize
Apologize--
Apologize!
Okay.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.
Let's
go.
Mind
if
I
come
in?
-
Sure.
Come
here.
Why
you
bounce
I
told
all
my
jokes.
It
turns
out
The
right
girl
will
find
you
even
though
I'm
gonna
hate
You'll
never
lose
me,
Mom.
I'll
always
love
you,
Oh.
