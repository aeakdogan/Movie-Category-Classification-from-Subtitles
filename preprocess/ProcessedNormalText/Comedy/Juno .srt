the

Fertile

I
don't
know,
it's
not

I'll
take
some
of

There
it
is.
The

Unfortunately
yes.

That
was
kind
of
the
emotion
that
I

So,
you
were
bored?
That's
how

the
act
was
premeditated.
I

the

actually
really
complicated,

like
talking
about

So
what
was
it

Magnificent.
Hey,

that,
I
always
picture
them
naked,
even
if
I
don't
want
to,
I'm
supposed
to
be
running.
So
guess
what.
What?
I
don't
know.
I'm
pregnant.
What
should
we
do?
Oh,
you
know,
I
was
thinking
I'd
just
nip
it
Because
they
were
talking
about
it
in
health
class,
how
pregnancy
can
often
lead
to
an
infant.
Typically,

That's
what
happens

Well,
I'm
sorry
I
had
sex
with
you,
I
know
it
wasn't
your
idea.
Whose
idea
was
it?
I'll
see
you
at
school
,
alright?
Whose
idea
was
it?
Hey,
your

was
your

nice
urn
by

There
was
some
blue
shit,
I

gunk,
stuff
in

this
morning.
I
would
never
barf
in

Hi,
Juno.
How

you?
You

pretty
solid.
So

No,

to
work
on
it
a
little
last
night,
I'll
sell
you
some
of
my
Adderall.
No
thanks,
I'm
off
pills.
That's
a
wise
choice
'cause
I
knew
this
girl,
She
took
too
many
behavioral
meds
at
once
and
she
and
dove
into
the
fountain
at
Ridgedale
Mall

I
heard
that
was
you.
It
was
good
seeing
you,
Su-Chin.
Your
baby
probably
has
a
beating
heart,
you
know?
It
can
feel
pain,
And
it
has
fingernails.
Fingernails?
Really?

I
need
you
to
fill
these
out,
both
sides.
Would
you
like
a
free
condom?
Theyre

No,

My

we
have

his
jocks

All

your

Dude,
what
are
you
doing
here?
I'm
supposed
to
come
get
you

I
couldnt
do
it,
Leah!
It
smelled
like
a
dentist
office
in
there,
And
there
were
these
horrible
magazines
And
then
the
friggin'
receptionist
is
trying
to
give
me

just
babbling
away
about

And
Su-Chin
was
there,
and

Dude!
You
gotta
keep
your
voice
down,
my
mom
is

What
does
that
even
mean?
I've
been
thinking.
I
was
thinking
that
I
could
have
this
baby
and
You
know,
like
a
woman
with
a
bum
ovary
or
But
then
youre
gonna
get

while
you
were
out
running
today.
You
know
how
I
feel
about
her.
Youve
mentioned
it
a

times.
She

different.
Yeah.
I
'm
not
really
sure
how
I'm
gonna
spit
this
out.
Hon,

No.
The

likely

I
was
just
asking.
It
seemed
plausible.
Do
you

amount
of

No,
Im
not
asking
for
anything.
Except
for
maybe
mercy.

you
done,

for

I

who
is
the
father,
Juno?
It's
Paulie

Paulie
Bleeker?
What?
I
didnt
think
he
had
it
in
him!

about

What

Tell

I

to
play

band
for

and
I

on

When

You

My

one
of
those
Tony
Little
Gazelles
off
the
TV.
You
know,
from
the
guy
with
the
ponytail?
That
guy
just
doesnt
look
right
to
me.
I'll
be
right
back.
Excuse
me.
Hi.
Hi.
You're
playing
music?
Juno
wanted
a
little
closer
look
at
Your
guitar
is
named
Kimber?
Yeah.
Thats
cool.
My
axe
is
named
Roosevelt.
After
Franklin,
Gerta
is
downstairs,
we
still
have
a
lot
of
stuff
to
go
over.
I
got
it.
Not
to
interrupt
the
jam
session.
So,
just
look
these
over
and
if
you
have
any
questions,
We
would
really
appreciate
it
if
you
would
just
keep
us
Ultrasounds,
For
sure.
You
want
to
You
think
youre
really
Yeah.
I
like
you
guys.
How
sure
would
you
say
you
are?
Would
you
say
youre
80%
sure,
90%
sure?
Im
going
to
say
Im
about
104%
sure.
Really?
Seriously,
if
I
could
just
have
the
thing
and
But
I'm
guessing
it
looks
probably
like
a
And
we
should
let
it
get
a
little
cuter,
right?
-
Yeah.
Keep
it
in
the
oven.
I
think
that's
a
great
idea.
Nice
to
meet
you
both.
Please,
drive
carefully.
-
Take
care.
Hey,
man.
Hey,
Vijay.
Did
you
hear
Juno
MacGuff
is
pregnant?
Yeah.
-
Like
our
moms
and
teachers!
Did
you
hear
its
yours?
Yup.
What
a
trip,
man.
I
dont
really
know
too
much
about
it.
You
should
grow
a
moustache.
I
cant.
Me
neither.
But
Im
going
to
stop
wearing
underpants.
Raise
my
sperm
count.
Juno,
hey.
Hey,
Bleek.
Me
and
some
guys
are
gonna
go
to
the
movies
after
with
the
guy
who
has
eighteen
kids.
Do
you
want
to
come?
Sounds
awesome,
but
I
got
my
ultrasound.
Oh,
really?
Can
I
...
...
Should
I
come?
Oh,
you
can't
waste
those
donut
balls,
But
maybe
I
could
drop
by
later.
Okay,
cool.
-
Later,
Bleek.
I'll
save
you
a
seat.
There's
your
baby.
Oh,
my
God.
There's
a
hand.
And
an
arm.
And
there's
the
feet.
Would
you
look
at
that?
Check
out
Baby
Big-Head.
Dude,

Excuse
me,
I
am
a
sacred
vessel.
All

that
there's
actually
saps
that
What?
I'm
not
made
of
stone.
Well,
there
you
have
it.
Would
you
like
to
know
the
sex?
-
Yes.
-
Please,
Junebug?
Planning
to
be
surprised
when
you
deliver?
I
want
Mark
and
Vanessa
to
be
surprised,
and
if
Are
Mark
and
Vanessa
your
friends
at
school?
No,
theyre
the
adoptive
parents.
Oh.
Well,
thank
goodness
for
that.
Whats
that
supposed
to
mean?
I
just
see
a
lot
of
teenage
mothers
Its
obviously
a
poisonous
environment
How
do
you
know
that
Im
so
poisonous?
What
if
these
adoptive
parents
Or
like
stage
parents.
They
could
be
utterly
negligent.

raising
a
kid
than
my
dumbass
stepdaughter
No,
I
guess
not.
What
is
your
job
title,
exactly?
Im
an
ultrasound
technician,
maam.
Well
Im
a
nail
technician,
and
I
think
we
both
Excuse
me?
You
think
youre
so
special
because
you
get
to
play
My
five
year-old
daughter
could
do
that,
and
let
me
tell
you,
So
why
dont
you
go
back
to
night
school
in
Manteno
Bren,

dick!
I

Juno?
Wow,
I
didnt
expect
to
see
you
here.
I

something
really
cool

No,
actually
shes
working
late
tonight.
Shes
trying
to
accrue
as

Oh
right.
I
hear
these
are
quite
the
time-suck.
Wanna
come
in?
I
was
just
having
a

Cooler.
Would
you
like
one?
What

something
to
do
with
those
Theyre
not

though.
Why
arent

at
work?
I
work
mostly
from
home.
Im
a
composer.
No
shit.
Like
Johannes
Brahms?
No,

commercial
stuff.
Like
what?
Commercials.
Have
you
seen
the
ads
for
the
Paid
for
this
kitchen.
Youre
quite
the
sellout,
Mark.
What
would
the
Melvins
say?
Did
you
say
you
had
something
to
show
me.
Behold,
good
sir!
Your
future
child.
Hey,
look
at
that.
I
think
it
looks
like
my
friend
Paulie.
Is
he
also
bald
and
amorphous?
No,
hes
the
dad.
Can
you
tell
if
its
a
boy
or
a
girl?
I
can't,
the
doctor
can.
Well,
it
can
only
go
one
of
two
ways.
Thats
what
you
think.
I
drink
tons
of
booze
so
you
might
Junk,
huh?
You
know,
its
parts.
I
know
what
junk
is.
Yeah,
right.
We
definitely
want
it
to
have
some
junk,
please.
Well,
you
dont
need
to
worry
about
a
thing.
My
stepmom,
Bren,
makes
me
eat
super
healthy.
I
can't
stand
in
front
of
the
microwave
I
hope
you're
ready.
Ooh...
do
you
hear
that?
What?
This
is
my
favorite
song.
Its
Sonic
Youth
doing
Oh,
yeah,
yeah,
I
know
the
Carpenters.
Chick
drummer,
freaky
dude.
Not
You
havent
heard
the
Carpenters
like
this.
Just
listen.
Yeah,
I
like
this.
What
did
you
say
your
favorite
band
was?
Didnt.
Its
a
three-way
tie
between
the
Stooges,
I
definitely
need
to
make
you
some
CDs.
The
Wizard
of
Gore?
That
is
Herschel
Gordon
Lewis.
Please.
Dario
Argento
is
so
the
ultimate
Argento?
He's
alright,
but
Lewis
is
Were
talking
buckets
of
goo.
Red
corn
syrup
Quite
frankly,
this
looks
a
little
stupid.
Give
me
the
tape.
This
is
even
better
than
Suspiria.
What'd
I
tell
ya?
You
have
decent
taste
in
slasher
movies.
Heres
to
dovetailing
interests.
Have
you
guys
thought
of
Sort
of,
yes.
Vanessa
likes
Madison?
Isn't
that
a
little,
gay?
Well,
pretentious
much?
Should
everyone
just
have
a
My
dad
went
through
this
huge
obsession
with
He
decided
to
name
me
after
Zeuss
wife,
Zeus
had
tons
of
lays,
but
Im
pretty
sure
She
was
supposed
to
be
really
beautiful
but
That
suits
you.
Thanks?
Youre
something
else.
Vanessa.
You'd
better
go.
She
hates
when
I
sit
around
watching
movies
Ill
handle
this.
Im
really
good
No,
Juno,
no.
Juno,
what's
going
on?
-
Nothing.
Nothing,
I
went
to
the
doctor
today.
Is
there
something
wrong
with
the
baby?
The
baby
is
great.
Its
the
right
size
and
everything.
Here.
It's
the
baby.
It's
your
baby.
It
kinda
looks
like
its
waving.
Like
its
saying
"Hey,
Vanessa.
Yeah,
it
kind
of
does.
Juno
was
nice
enough
to
bring
that
over
for
us
today.
I
came
as
soon
as
I
got
that
ultrasound
goo
It
was
crazy
actually,
My
stepmom
verbally
abused
the
ultrasound
tech
Wow,
what
kind
of
swag
did
you
score?
Mall
madness,
huh?
Its
just
some
stuff
I
picked
up
for
the
baby.
Don't
you
usually
get
all
that
When
my
stepmom
was
pregnant
with
my
little
sister
But
I
wasn't
jealous
'cause
they
all
were
super
lame.
I
doubt
anyones
gonna
throw
us
a
shower.
Why
wouldn't
they
throw
you
a
baby
shower?
I
don't
think
people
know
how
to
feel
about
this
What
isn't
set
...
You
don't
think
Im
going
to
flake
out
on
you?
No,
I
dont,
Juno.
We
went
through
a
situation
before
where
it
didnt
work
out.
Cold
feet.
You
should
have
gone
to
China.
I
hear
they
give
away
babies
like
free
iPods.
They
put
em
in
those
T-shirt
guns
and
shoot
them
out
at
sporting
events.
Your
parents
are
probably
wondering
where
you
are.
Naah.
Im
already
pregnant,
so
what
other
kind
of
shenanigans
could
I
get
into?
I
should
probably
bounce.
Hey,
dont
forget
your
bag.
Ah,
bag!
Okay,
take
care.
Where
the
hell
have
you
been,
Junebug?
I
just
drove
to
St.
Cloud
to
show
Mark
and
Vanessa
the
ultrasound.
A
couple
of
hours?
Why
are
you
They
wanted
to
know
about
this
stuff.
You
could
have
mailed
it
to
them.
Why
would
you
drive
an
hour
out
to
East
Jesus,
Nowhere?
I
dont
know,
I
just
did.
And
while
Mark
and
I
were
waiting
for
Vanessa,
And
he
burned
me
a
couple
of
CDs
of
this
weird
music.
Hes
kind
of
cool.
Juno,
you
can't
just
drop
in
on
them
like
that.
No,
it
was
not
a
big
deal.
You
don't
understand.
Mark
is
a
married
man,
there
are
boundaries.
Oh,
come
on.
Listen,
Bren-duhhh.
Youre
acting
like
youre
the
one
who
has
to
go
through
this
What
does
it
even
matter
if
hes
married?
It
doesnt
work
that
way,
kiddo.
You
dont
know
anything
about
me!
I
know
enough.
We
don't
even
have
a
dog!
Yeah,
because
youre
allergic
to
their
saliva.
I
have
sacrificed
a
lot
for
you,
Juno.
Im
going
to
get
Weimaraners.
Wow,
dream
big!
Oh,
go
fly
a
kite.
Hi,
Juno.
What
can
I
do
for
you?
Bleeker
home?
Bleekers
mom
was
possibly
attractive
once.
But
now
she
looks
a
hobbit.
You
know,
the
fat
one
that
was
in
The
Goonies.
Hey,
man,
Dont
concentrate
so
hard.
Hey,
whats
up?
Not
much,
I
just
wanted
to
come
say
hey.
Orange
Tic-Tacs
are
Bleekers
one
and
only
vice.
The
day
I
got
pregnant,
You
seem
to
be
getting
...
...
pregnant-er
these
days.
Ya
know,
I
set
up
this
whole
...
and
this
married
couple
in
Saint
Cloud
Really?
What
are
they
like?
The
guy,
he's
awesome.
His
name
is
Mark
and
he
likes
old
horror
movies
and
he
plays
the
guitar.
We
actually
hung
out
this
afternoon.
Is
that
normal?
Probably
not,
but
...
I
talked
to
dad
and
Bren
and
they
said
they
wouldn't
So,
I
think
we
should
be
cool.
That's
a
relief.
Im
gonna
start
looking
like
a
pretty
big
dork
soon.
Will
you
still
think
Im
cute
when
Im
huge?
I
always
think
youre
cute.
I
think
youre
beautiful.
Jeez,
Bleek.
I
do.
Hey
Junebug,
when
this
is
all
over
we
should
get
Yeah.
That
would
be
awesome.
Once
Tino
gets
a
new
drumhead
we're
just,
like,
ready
to
rock.
We
could
always
get
back
together
too.
That's
an
option.
Were
we
together?
Yeah,
we
were
once.
That
time.
What
about
Katrina
De
Voort?
You
could
totally
go
out
with
Katrina
De
Voort.
I
dont
like
Katrina.
She
smells
like
soup.
Her
whole
house
smells
of
soup.
Okay.
So
we
have
Custard,
Cheesecake.
They're
yellow.
I
wanted
to
pick
something
that
was
gender-neutral
Why
does
everyone
think
yellow
is
gender-neutral?
I
dont
know
any
guy
with
a
yellow
bedroom.
I'm
thinking
more
Custard
with
this
light.
I
dont
know.
Maybe
I
should
paint
a
larger
swatch
...
Or
you
could
wait
a
few
more
months.
Its
not
like
the
babys
going
to
storm
in
here
"What
to
Expect"
says
that
readying
the
babys
room
Especially
if
you're
adopting.
Nesting?
Are
you
going
to
build
the
crib
You
should
read
the
book.
I
I
think
its
too
early
to
paint.
Thats
my
opinion.
I
disagree.
This
wall
is
going
to
need
something.
Our
first
family
photo
right
in
the
middle.
Right
up
there.
Can
you
see
it?
Yum!
This
pretzel
tastes
like
a
friggin
donut!
Share
the
love,
sweetness!
You
can't
have
any.
She's
assaulting
me!
Shes
denying
me
fresh-baked
goodness!
Oh,
my
God.
Thats
her.
Thats
Vanessa
Loring.
Of
the
Penny
Saver
Lorings?
Dude,
she's,
like,
really
pretty.
You
sound
totally
shocked
or
something.
Shes
totally
gonna
steal
that
kid
for
her
collection.
Right,
seriously.
Boring!
I
could
so
go
for
a
huge
cookie
right
now
God,
Spermy.
Must
you
always
feed?
It's
like,
never-ending
for
you.
Juno!
Hi,
Vanessa!
What
brings
you
to
the
mall
today?
I
was
just
shopping
with
my
girlfriends.
You're
gay?
No.
Just
ignore
her.
Well,
how
are
you
feeling?
Great!
Everything's
stupendous.
Oh,
coming
in
on
that
snooze
button.
Thats
incredible.
Oh,
God.
What?
Kicking
away.
Could
I
feel
it?
Are
you
kidding?
At
school
everyone's
just
grabbing
my
belly
all
the
time.
Im
a
legend.
They
call
me
the
Cautionary
Whale.
I
cant
feel
anything.
Its
not
moving
for
me.
You
should
try
talking
to
it.
They
can
hear
you,
Hi,
baby.
Its
me.
It's
Vanessa.
I
cant
wait
to
meet
you.
Can
you
hear
me,
baby?
Sweet
angel?
I
felt
it!
That
was
magical.
Thank
you.
Thank
you.
Hello?
Hey!
So,
Ive
been
listening
to
Yeah?
Whats
the
verdict?
Well,
its
cute.
It's
cute?
When
youre
used
to
listening
to
the
raw
power
everything
else
just
sounds
kind
of
precious
I
imagine
you
have
a
collection
of
Well
...
...
consider
it
your
musical
education.
I
can't
wait
to
see
what
you've
got
to
teach
me.
Stop
surfing
porn
and
get
back
to
work.
Just
wanted
to
call
and
say
hi.
Go
learn
something.
-
Oh,
a
little
trip
down
Mexico
way.
How
many
months
has
it
been
now?
You're
getting
huge.
It's
homing
in
on
the
eight.
I
wish
my
funbags
would
get
bigger.
Trust
me,
you
dont.
I
have
to
actually
and
rub
all
this
nasty
cocoa
butter
stuff
Hot!
Why
is
everyone
always
staring
at
me?
Well,
you
are
kind
of
convex,
you
know?
Whoah!
Who's
been
doing
I
have
no
choice.
Keith
has
been
Do
not
call
Mr.
Conyers
"Keith".
'Cause
my
barf
reflex
is
But
Keiths
hot.
Eww,
hes
all
beardy!
Did
you
hear
that
Bleek
is
going
to
the
prom
Katrina?
No
way,
he
doesnt
like
Katrina.
Must
be
like
a
pity
date
or
something.
I
heard
he
asked
her
and
that
the're
going
to
Benihana,
He
told
me
that
Katrinas
house
smells
like
soup!
Oh
my
God,
it
totally
does.
I
was
there
four
years
ago
for
her
birthday
party
and
it
But
you
know,
boys
have
endured
Oh,
please.
There
is
no
way
that
theyre
having
sex,
They
wouldn't
even
be
holding
hands.
I
wouldnt
be
so
sure,
Yeah,
'cause
Bleek
trusts
me.
Were
best
friends.
Are
you
jealous?
I
thought
you
said
you
didnt
care
what
he
did.
Not
jealous,
dont
care.
I
know
Bleek
doesnt
like
Katrina
and
he
shouldn't
Uh-huh,
Im
really
convinced.
Prom
is
for
wenises,
anyway.
As
soon
as
youre
old
enough
to
go,
Are
you
honestly
and
truly
going
to
the
prom
Uh,
hi?
Leah
just
said
that
you
were
gonna
go
with
her.
Yeah,
I
did
ask
her
if
she
wanted
to
go.
A
bunch
of
us
from
the
team
are
going
to
Benihana,
Were
getting
a
stretch
limo.
Your
mom
must
be
pretty
stoked
that
youre
Youre
mad.
Why
are
you
mad?
Im
not
mad.
Im
in
a
great
mood.
Despite
the
fact
that
Im
in
a
fat
suit
I
cant
take
fun
of
me
behind
my
back,
despite
the
fact
that
your
Katrinas
not
my
girlfriend!
And
I
doubt
That's
just
the
way
her
face
looks.
Just
take
Soupy
Sales
to
prom,
I
can
think
of
so
I
might
pumice
my
feet
or
go
to
Brens
Unitarian
church,
All
those
things
would
be
exponentially
cooler
than
Youre
being
really
immature.
You
have
no
reason
to
be
mad
at
me.
You
broke
my
heart.
I
should
be
really
cheesed
off.
Why?
Because
I
got
bored
and
had
sex
with
you,
Like
Id
marry
you!
And
I
know
that
you
werent
bored
that
day
because
there
was
a
lot
of
stuff
on
TV.
The
Blair
Witch
"I
haven't
seen
this
since
it
came
out,
You
just
take
Katrina
the
Douche
Packer
to
the
prom.
I
still
have
your
underwear.
I
still
have
your
virginity!
Would
you
shut
up!
What?
Are
you
ashamed
that
we
did
it?
-
No.
you
dont
have
to
have
the
Im
a
planet!
Wait,
let
me
get
your
bag.
Whats
another
ten
pounds?
Hi.
Wow.
That
shirt's
working
hard.
Is
Vanessa
here?
No.
We
are
safe.
I'm
glad
you're
here,
I
actually
have
something
for
you.
Almost
there.
Whoah,
Mark!
Is
this
the
babys
room?
Its
beautiful!
Hilarious.
This
is
where
I
keep
all
my
old
comics,
And
I
want
to
show
you
one.
Youre
one
of
those
guys?
Take
a
look.
Most
Fruitful
Yuki?
Is
this
a
pregnant
superhero?
Isnt
that
great?
I
found
it
in
Japan
when
I
was
there
with
my
band.
Hells,
yeah!
This
actually
makes
me
feel
way
less
of
a
fat
dork.
Yuki
is
a
real
bad
ass.
Thank
you.
Oh,
how
about
some
tunage?
Alright,
don't
look,
no
matter
what.
This
one
is
actually
kinda
slow.
But
its
I
know
this
one.
-
You
do?
I
danced
to
this
at
my
senior
prom.
Who'd
you
dance
with?
Cynthia
Vogel,
great
dance
partner.
-
Hot.
I
can
just,
totally,
picture
you
dancing,
Like
a
total
dork!
Her
hands
there,
And
my
hands
down
here.
This
is
how
we
did
it
in
'88.
Like
this?
Just
like
this.
Youve
never
been
to
a
dance
before?
Dances
are
for
nerds
and
squares.
What
are
you?
I
don't
know.
I
feel
like
theres
something
between
us.
Im
leaving
Vanessa.
What?
Im
getting
a
place
in
the
city.
No!
No?
No!
You
definitely
can't
do
that.
Thats
one
big,
fat
sack
of
no!
What
is
the
matter?
You
guys
are
supposed
to
take
care
of
this.
I
thought
you'd
be
cool
with
this.
I
want
things
to
be
perfect.
I
don't
want
them
Look,
I'll
have
the
baby,
and
Vanessa
is
A
baby
is
not
going
to
fix
everything.
Besides,
I
dont
know
if
But
youre
old!
How
do
you
think
of
me?
Why
are
you
over
here?
I
...
I
just
like
being
a
piece
of
This
is
what
my
life
has
become.
I
got
stuff
-
This
is
my
fault.
Is
Vanessa
mad
Thats
got
nothing
to
do
with
it.
You
were
in
love
when
If
you're
in
love
once,
you
can
be
in
love
again.
My
friend
Leah
has
been
with
the
same
guy
four
different
times.
Youre
just
not
trying
hard
enough.
Im
such
an
idiot.
I
cant
believe
No,
you
know
what,
Mark.
Do
not
divorce
your
wife!
Will
you
please
just
do
me
a
solid
and
stay
Youre
so
young.
I'm
not
that
young.
Im
sixteen.
Im
old
enough
to
know
Oh,
and
you
know
what,
I
bought
another
Sonic
Youth
album
and
it
sucks!
Juno?
Whats
going
on?
Nothing.
Why
are
you
crying?
Im
not
crying.
Im
just
allergic
to
fine
home
furnishings.
Whats
the
matter?
Whats
the
matter?
Shes
just
a
little
hormonal.
Right,
Juno?
What
did
you
do?
I
didnt
do
anything
...
Just...
Ive
been
thinking.
-
What?
What
are
you
talking
about?
Just
wondering
if
it's,
Just
wondering
if
we're
ready.
Yeah,
we're
ready.
Were
ready.
We've
read
the
books,
weve
taken
all
the
Vanessa,
I
know
were
prepared.
Wait
a
minute.
Juno,
dont
listen
to
him.
He's
just
being
a
guy.
The
books
all
say
the
same
thing.
A
man
becomes
a
father
when
Hes
going
to
get
there.
It
just
happened
so
fast.
We
put
the
ad
in
the
paper
Two
weeks
later,
shes
on
that
couch.
She
answered
our
prayers.
Ever
since
then
its
been
like
a
ticking
clock.
What
are
you
saying?
That
it
feels
a
little
like
bad
timing.
What
would
be
a
good
time
for
you,
Mark?
Theres
just
some
things
that
Like
what?
Be
a
rock
star?
Dont
mock
me.
I'm
just
saying
that
this
is,
This
is
something
that's
never
going
to
happen.
Your
shirt
is
stupid.
Grow
up.
If
I
have
to
wait
for
you
to
become
Kurt
Cobain,
I
never
said
Id
be
a
good
father.
I
called
Gerta
Rauss
and
she
said
that
she
can
represent
Its
all
the
rage
right
now,
supposedly.
And
it
would
be
pretty
easy
because
Thanks
for
making
the
call,
I
guess.
Have
you
found
a
place
to
stay
yet?
-
Yeah,
downtown.
No,
it's
not
a
hotel.
Arent
you
the
cool
guy?
I
wanted
a
baby
so
bad.
I
know.
-
It
looks
like
a
bill
from
Jiffy-Lube.
I
never
realize
how
much
I
like
being
home
unless
Hey,
Dad.
Hey,
big
puffy
version
of
Junebug.
Where
have
you
been?
Dealing
with
things
way
beyond
my
Where
is
everybody?
Bren
took
Liberty
Bell
to
her
When
will
you
guys
learn
that
tots
cant
ice
skate?
You're
looking
a
little
morose,
honey.
Whats
eating
you?
Im
just,
like,
losing
my
faith
with
humanity.
Can
you
narrow
that
down
for
me?
I
just
...
...
wonder
if
...
...
two
people
can
stay
together
for
good.
You
mean
like
couples?
Yeah,
like,
People
in
love.
Are
you
having
boy
trouble
'cause
I
gotta
be
honest;
I
dont
really
much
approve
of
you
dating
in
your
condition,
Thats
kind
of
messed
up.
No,
dad!
I
mean,
thats
pretty
skanky.
Isnt
that
what
you
girls
call
it?
Please
stop.
Tore
up
from
the
floor
up?
That's
not
what
it's
about.
I
just
need
to
know
that
its
possible
that
Its
not
easy,
thats
for
sure.
I
don't
have
the
best
track
I've
been
with
your
stepmother
and
Im
proud
to
say
that
were
very
happy.
Look
...
...
In
my
opinion
...
The
best
thing
you
can
do
is
find
a
person
Good
mood,
bad
mood,
ugly,
pretty,
Handsome,
what
have
you,
the
right
person
is
still
gonna
think
Thats
the
kind
of
person
thats
worth
Yeah.
I
think
I've
found
that
person.
Yeah,
sure
you
have.
Your
old
D-A-D!
You
know
Ill
always
be
there
to
love
you,
support
you,
Obviously.
Dad,
I
think
i'm
just
gonna,
shove
out
for
a
sec,
but,
I
won't
be
home
late.
Okay.
You
were
talking
about
me,
right?
Oh,
yeah.
Hi.
Did
you
put
like
a
hundred
things
Oh,
yeah,
that
was
me.
Why?
Theyre
your
fave.
You
can
never
have
too
many
of
your
Yeah,
well
thanks,
I
...
...
I
think
Im
pretty
much
set
until
You
know,
Bleek,
I
was
thinking.
Im
sorry
I
was
such
a
huge
bitch
to
you.
Its
okay.
Also,
I
think
Im
in
love
with
you.
What,
you
mean
as
friends?
No.
I
mean,
for
real.
Because
you're,
like,
the
coolest
person
Ive
ever
met.
And
you
dont
even
have
to
try.
I
try
really
hard,
actually.
Youre,
like,
naturally
smart.
You're
not
like
everyone
else.
You
don't
stare
at
my
stomach
all
the
time,
And
every
time
I
see
you,
It
does?
I
think
its
because
my
heart
Mine
too.
Thats
all
I
could
ask
for.
Youre
golden,
man.
Can
we
make
out
now?
Yeah.
You
know,
you
can
go
into
early
Dad!
What?
Dad,
either
I
just
peed
my
pants
or
...
Or?
Thundercats
are
go!
All
out,
all
out!
Do
you
have
the
admittance
form?
What
about
the
parking
stickers?
Have
you
got
Liberty
Bell?
Oh,
sweetie,
sweetie!
Here
we
go.
Hurry!
Start
the
car,
go!
Gas!
-
Wait,
wait!
-
Don't
do
that.
-
That.
Bren,
when
do
I
get
that
friggin'
Spinal
Tap
thing?
Its
called
a
spinal
block,
and
you
cant
have
it
yet,
honey.
Come
on!
I
have
to
wait
for
it
to
get
worse?
Honey,
doctors
are
sadists
who
like
to
Oh,
shit.
Excuse
me!
Can
we
give
my
kid
the
damn
And
then
...
...
out
of
nowhere
...
...
there
it
was
...
There
he
was.
I
decided
not
to
call
Bleeker
to
He
had
a
big
meet
against
Manteno
and
I
didnt
But
he
figured
it
out
anyway.
Someday
youll
be
back
here,
honey.
On
your
terms.
Hey.
Nice
legs.
Bleeker
decided
he
didnt
want
to
see
the
baby.
Neither
did
I,
really.
He
didnt
feel
like
ours.
I
think
he
was
always
hers.
Would
you
like
to
meet
your
son?
I
have
a
son?
How
do
I
look?
Like
a
new
mom.
Scared
shitless.
It
ended
with
a
chair.
As
boyfriends
go,
Paulie
Bleeker
is
totally
boss.
I
know
people
are
supposed
to
fall
in
love
I
guess
normalcys
not
really
our
style.
Hey.
Hey.
Ready?
Yeah.
