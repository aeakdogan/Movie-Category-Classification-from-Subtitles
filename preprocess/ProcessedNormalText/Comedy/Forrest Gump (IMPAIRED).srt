Hello.
My
name's
Do
you
want
a
chocolate?
I
could
eat
about
a
million
My
mama
always
said
Iife
was
like
You
never
know
what
Those
must
be
I
bet
you
could
walk
all
day
and
not
feel
a
thing.
I
wish
I
had
shoes
like
that.
My
feet
hurt
.
Mama
always
said
you
can
tell
about
Where
they're
going,
where
they've
been.
I've
worn
lots
ofshoes.
I
bet
if
I
think
I
could
remember
Mama
said
they'd

All
right,
Forrest,
Let's
take
a
little
walk
around.
How
do
those
feel?
His
legs
are
strong,
as
strong
as
I've
ever
seen.
But
his
back's
as
But
we're
going
to
straighten
him
Forrest!
Now,
when
I
was
a
baby,
Mama
named
me
after
General
Nathan
Bedford
Forrest.
General
Nathan
Bedford
Forrest.
She
said
we
was
related
What
he
did
was,
hetarted
up
this
club
They'd
all
dress
up
in
their
robes
and
act
like
a
bunch
They'd
even
put
bed
sheets
And,
anyway,
that'show
Mama
said
the
Forrest
part
that
sometimes
we
all
that
just
don't
make
no
sense.
This
way.
Hold
on.
Ugh!
All
right.
What
are
y'all
staring
at?
Haven't
you
ever
seen
a
little
boy
with
braces
Don't
ever
let
anybody
tell
you
they're
better
If
God
intended
everybody
he'd
have
given
us
all
Mama
always
hada
way
of
explaining
We
lived
about
a
quarter
mile
about
a
halfmile
from
the
town
That's
in
the
county
Our
house
had
been
since
her
grandpa's
had
come
across
the
ocean
Since
it
was
just
me
and
Mama
and
we
had
all
these
empty
rooms,
Mama
decided
to
let
those
rooms
out,
mostly
to
people
passing
through,
Iike
from,
oh,
Mobile,
That'show
me
and
Mama
got
money.
Mama
was
a
real
smart
lady.
Remember
what
I
told
you,
Forrest.
You're
no
different
Did
you
hear
You're
the
same
You
are
no
different.
Your
boy's...different,
His
I.Q
is
75.
Well,
we're
all
different,
Mr.
Hancock.
She
wan
ted
me
to
have
so
she
to
ok
me
to
I
met
the
principal
and
all.
I
want
to
show
you
something,
Now,
this
is
normal.
Forrest
is
right
here
.
The
state
require
s
to
attend
public
school.
Mrs.
Gump,
he's
going
to
have
to
Now,
he'll
bejust
fine.
What
does
normal
mean
anyway
?
He
might
be...
a
bit
on
the
slow
side,
but
my
boy
Forrest
is
going
to
get
the
same
He's
not
going
to
to
learn
how
to
retread
tires.
We're
talking
about
There
must
be
something
We're
a
progressive
We
don't
want
to
see
Is
there
a
Mr.
Gump,
Mrs.
Gump?
He's
on
vacation.
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Well,
your
mama
sure
does
care
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
You
don't
say
much,
do
you?
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
Eee!
"Finally,
he
had
to
try.
"It
looked
easy,
but...
oh,
what
happened.
Mama,
what's
vacation
mean?
Vacation?
Where
Daddy
went?
Vacation's
when
and
you
don't
ever
come
back.
Anyway,
I
guess
you
could
say
me
and
Mama
was
on
our
own.
But
we
didn't
mind.
Our
house
was
never
empty.
There
was
always
folks
Supper!
It's
supper,
everyone!
That
sure
looks
special.
Sometimes,
we
had
that
every
room
was
filled,
folks
living
and
hat
cases
Forrest
Gump,
One
time,
a
young
man
and
he
had
him
a
guitar
case.

#
Well,
you
ain't
#
And
you
ain't
no
#
#
Friend
of
mine
##
Forrest,
I
told
you
not
to
bother
No,
that's
all
right,
ma'am.
I
was
showing
him
All
right.
Supper's
ready
Yeah,
that
sounds
good.
Say,
man,
show
me
that
crazy
Slow
it
down
some.
#
You
ain't
nothing
but--
#
I
liked
that
guitar.
It
so
unded
good.
Is
tarted
moving
around
swinging
my
hips.
#
Cryin'
all
the
time
##
This
one
night,
me
and
Mama
was
out
shopping,
and
we
walked
by
Vincy's
and
guess
what?
#
You
ain't
nothin'
#
Cryin'all
the
time#
#
You
ain't
nothin'
This
is
not
for
#
Cryin'all
the
time#
Some
years
later,
that
handsome
young
man
well,
he
sung
too
many
songs.
Had
him
self
a
heart
attack
It
must
be
hard
being
a
king.
You
know,
it's
funny
how
you
but
some
things
you
can't.
You
do
your
very
best
now,
Forrest.
I
sure
will,
Mama.
I
remember
the
bus
ride
very
well.
Are
you
coming
along?
Mama
said
not
to
be
This
is
the
bus
to
school.
I'm
Forrest--
I'm
Dorothy
Harris.
Well,
now
we
ain't
This
seat's
taken.
It's
taken.
You
can't
sit
here
.
You
know,
it
's
funny
what
'cause
I
don
't
I
don't
recall
what
I
got
and
I
don't
know
when
I
went
on
but
I
do
remember
the
first
time
I
heard
in
the
wide
world.
You
can
sit
here
I
had
never
seen
anything
She
was
like
an
angel.
Well,
are
you
going
to
What's
wrong
with
your
legs?
Um,
nothing
at
all,
thank
you.
My
legs
are
just
fine
and
dandy.
I
just
sat
next
to
her
and
had
a
conversation
My
back's
crooked
Next
to
Mama,
or
asked
me
questions.
Are
you
stupid
or
something?
Mama
says,
I'm
Jenny
.
I'm
Forrest--
Forrest
Gump.
From
that
day
on,
Jenny
and
me
She
taught
me
how
to
climb.
Come
on,
Forrest,
I
showed
her
how
to
dangle.
"A
good
little..."
She
help
edme
and
I
showed
her
how
to
swing.
Sometimes,
we'd
just
sitout
and
wait
for
the
stars.
Mama's
going
to
worry
about
me.
Just
stay
a
little
longer.
For
some
reason,
O.K.,Jenny,
I'll
stay
.
She
was
my
most
special
friend.
My
only
friend.
Now,
my
mama
always
told
me
that
miracles
happen
every
day
.
Some
people
don't
think
so,
but
they
do.
Hey,
dummy
!
Are
you
dumb,
Look,
I'm
Forrest
Gimp.
Just
run
away,
Forrest.
Run,
Forrest!
Run
away!
Hurry!
Get
the
bikes!
Let's
get
him!
Come
on!
Look
out,
Gump!
We're
going
to
get
you!
Run,
Forrest,
run!
Run,
Forrest!
Come
back
here,
you!
Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha!
Run,
Forrest!
Run!
Now,
you
wouldn't
but
I
could
run
From
that
day
on,
if
I
was
going
somewhere
,
I
was
running.
That
boy
sure
Now,
remember
how
I
told
you
that
Jenny
never
seemed
She
lived
in
a
house
Her
mama
had
gone
and
her
daddy
was
Jenny
?
He
was
a
very
loving
man.
He
was
always
kissing
And
then
this
one
time,
Jenny
wasn't
on
the
bus
Jenny,
why
didn't
you
Shh.
Daddy's
taking
a
nap.
Jenny
!
Come
on!
Jenny,
where'd
you
run
to?
You
better
Where
you
at?
Jenny
!
Jenny,
where
you
at?
Jenny
!
Pray
with
me,
Forrest.
Pray
with
me.
Jenny
!
Dear
God,
make
me
a
bird
far,
far
away
from
here
.
Dear
God,
make
me
a
bird
Mama
always
said
Jenny
!
He
didn
't
turn
Jenny
Instead,
he
had
the
police
say
Jenny
didn't
have
to
stay
She
was
to
live
just
over
on
Creek
more
Avenue,
which
made
me
happy,
Some
nights,
Jenny'd
sneak
out
and
come
on
over
to
my
house,
just'cause
Scared
of
what,
But
I
think
He
was
a
mean
dog.
Anyway,
Jenny
and
me
all
the
way
up
Hey,
stupid!
Quit
it!
Run,
Forrest,
run!
Hey
,
didn't
you
hear
me,
stupid?
Run,
Forrest!
Get
in
the
truck!
Come
on!
Run,
Forrest!
Run!
Ha,
ha!
Move
it!
Move
it!
You
better
be
runnin'!
Yeah!
-
Whoo-hoo!
Run,
Forrest!
Now,
it
used
to
be
I
ran
to
get
I
never
thought
Ohh!
Who
in
the
hell
is
that?
That
there
is
Forrest
Gump,
Coach.
Just
a
local
idiot.
And
can
you
believe
it
?
I
got
to
go
to
college,
too.
Forrest,
move
it!
Run!
O.K.

Run!
Run,

stupid
Run,
son
of
a
bitch,
run!
Run!
Run!
Go!

He
must
be
the
stupidest
but
he
sure
is
fast.
Now,
maybe
it's
just
me,
but

No,

I
was
in

Did

I
was
getting
yelled
at.
Sit

you
want
to.
I
didn't
know
who
I
might

or
what
they
might
ask.
You

been
No.
But
I

on
a
real
big
boat.
I'm
talking
about
I
been

My

To

That's
the
most
outstanding
You
must
have
You

goddamn
gifted,
Listen

people!
Now
for
some
reason,
Like
one
of
them
round

It's
not
really
hard.
You

your
bed
neat,
remember
to
stand
up
straight,
and
always
answere
very
question
with
"Yes,
Drill
Sergeant.
"
Is
that
clear?
Yes,
Drill
Sergeant!
What
you
do
is

Why

weapon
You

Jesus
H.
Christ.
This

a
new
company

If
it

a
fine
enlisted
man,
I'd
recommend
you
for
O.C.S.,
You're
going

weapon
Anyway,

was
saying,

Night
time
in
the
army
We'd
lay
there
in
our
bunks,
and
I'd
miss
my
mama,
and
I'd
miss
Jenny.
Hey,
Gump.
Get
a
load
of
the
tits
on
her.

The

Now

Except

Hey,

Oh,

What's

Look,

You

and
learn
from
the
guys
who've
been
in
country

I

Well,

I
felt
real
lucky
He
was
from

Somebody
in
his
family
and
died
in
every...
single...
American
war.
God
damn
it,
kick
some

Get
on

I
guess
you
could
say
he
had
a
lot
to
live
up
to.
So,

Well,

I
can't

Hold

Hold
up,
boys!
It
wasn't
always
fun.
Lieutenant
Dan
was
always
about
a
rock
or
a
trail
so
he'd
tell
us
Get
down!
Shut
up!
So
we
did.
Now
I
don't
know
but
I
think
some
of
served
in

There

Hup!
Step

The
good
thing
about

is
there
was
always
Fire

the
hole!
Gump,
check
out
that
hole.
And
there
was
always
Mount'em
up!
Spread
out!
One
day
it
started
raining,
and
it
didn't
quit
for
four
months.
We've
been
through
little
bitty
stinging
rain
and
big
old
fat
rain,
rain
that
flew
in
side
ways,
and
sometimes
rain
even
seemed
to
come
straight
up
Shoot,
it
even
rained
at
night.
Hey,
Forrest.
Hey,
Bubba.
I'm
going
to
lean
up
against
you.
You
lean
up
against
me.
This
way
we
don't
have
to
sleep
with
our
heads
in
the
mud.
You
know
why
we're
'Cause
we
be
watching
out
like
brothers
and
stuff.
Hey,
Forrest,
something
I
been
thinking
about.
I
got
a
very
important
How
would
you
like
to
go
into
the
shrimping
O.K.
Man,
I
tell
you
what.
I
got
it
all
figured
out,
too.
So
many
pounds
of
shrimp
will
pay
off
the
boat.
So
many
pounds
for
gas.
We'll
live
right
on
the
boat.
We
ain't
got
to
pay
no
rent.
We
can
just
work
it
together,
split
everything
right
Man,
I'm
telling
you,
50-50.
Hey,
Forrest,
That's
a
fine
idea.
Bubba
did
have
a
fine
idea.
I
even
wrote
Jenny
and
told
her
all
about
it.
I
sent
her
letters-
-
Not
every
day,
but
almost.
I
told
her
what
I
was
doing
and
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
and
told
her
how
And
how
I
was
looking
forward
to
getting
a
letter
from
her
just
as
soon
I'd
always
let
her
know
Then
I'd
sign
each
letter
#
There's
somethin'
This
one
day,
we
was
out
and
then,
just
like
that,
somebody
turned
off
the
rain,
and
the
sun
come
out.
#
I
got
to
beware
##
Ambush!
Take
cover!
Get
that
pig
up
here

I

so
far

pretty
so
on
which
was
a
bad
thing.
Bubba.
Bubba
was
my
best
good
friend.
I
had
to
make
sure
he
was
O.K.
Where
the
hell
are
you?
Bubba!
And
on
my
way
well,
there
was
this
boy
Tex.
O.K.
I
couldn't
let
him
scared
the
way
he
was,
so
I
grabbed
him
up
and
run
him
out
of
there.
Every
time
I
went
back
somebody
else
was
saying,
"Help
me,
Forrest,
help
me!
"
O.K.
Here.
Here
.
No
sweat,
man.
I
started
to
get
scared
I
know
my
position
is
danger
close!
We
got
Charlie
I
got
to
have
those
fast
movers
Lieutenant
Dan,
I
know
he's
dead!
My
whole
goddamn
platoon
God

What
are
you
doing?
You

me
here

Get

Get
out!
Aah!
God,
I
said
LegLima,

is
Strong-arm.
Be
advised
your
fast
movers
Then
it
felt
like
something
Aah!
Something
bit
me!
Aah!
Aah!
You
son
of
a
bitch!
Aah!
I
can't
leave
the
platoon.
I
told
you
Forget
about
me.
Did
you
hear
what
I
said?
Gump,
damn
it,
put
me
down.
Get
your
ass
out
of
here
.
I
didn't
ask
you
to
pull
me
out
Where

To

I

Forrest.
Bubba.
I'm

Forrest.
I'm

O-Oh,
Bubba,

I'll

all
right.

Come

Come

Come

Ugh.
I'm
O.K.,
Forrest.

I'm
O.K.
I'm
fine.

If
I'd
have
known
the
last
time
I'd
of
thought
of
Hey,
Bubba.
Hey,
Forrest.
Forrest--
Why
did
this
happen?
You
got
shot.
Then
Bubba
said
something
I
want
to
go
home.
Bubba
was
my
best
good
friend.
And
even
I
know
that
ain't
something
you
can
Bubba
was
going
to
be
but
instead,
he
died
right
there
That's
all
I
have
It
was
a
bullet,
wasn't
it?
A
bullet?
That
jumped
up
and
bit
you.
Oh.
Yes,
sir.
Bit
me
directly
They
said
it
was
a
million
the
army
must
keep
that
money
,
'cause
I
still

The
only

Good

Gump.
You
know
how
to
play
this?
Come
on.
Let
me
show
you.
Now,
the
secret
to
this
game
is
no
matter
what
happens,
never,
ever...
take
your
eye
off
the
ball.
All
right.
For
some
reason,
Ping-Pong
came
very
natural
to
me.
See?
Any
idiot
can
play
.
So
I
started
playing
it
I
played
Ping-Pong
even
when
I
didn't
have
anyone
The
hospital's
people
said
it
made
me
look
Whatever
that
means.
Even
Lieutenant
Dan
I
played
Ping-Pong
so
much,
I
even
played
it
in
my
sleep.
Now...
you
listen
to
me.
We
all
have
a
destiny

Nothing
just
happens.
I
should
have

Look

not
to
be
able
to
use
your
legs?
Y-Y
-Yes,

I
do.
Did
you
hear
what
I
said?
You
cheated
me!
I
had
a

That
was
my

You

Not
