was...
building
or
something.

was
that,

stuck
Great.

Hey,
if
I
could
assist
you
over
there,
-
What
are
you
talking
about?

Walk

We
could
walk
it
right
over
there.
CARL:
Now,
we're
gonna
walk

with
no
rap
music
or
flash
dancing.
We

days,
at
best,
before
And

we're
not
at
the
falls

Sand.
I
found
sand!
Don't
you
worry,
Ellie.

is
fun
already,
isn't
it?

the
time
we
get
there,

asked
you
about

five
minutes
ago.
Well,
I
didn't
have
to
go
then!

I
don't
wanna
walk
Russell,

you
don't

up,

but
can
I
tell
you
a
secret?
-
No.
I
never
actually
built
a
tent
before.
You've
been
camping
before,
Well,
never
outside.
Well,
why
didn't
you
ask
your
dad
I
don't
think
he
wants
Well,
why
don't
you
try
him
sometime.
Well,
he's
away
a
lot.
He's
gotta
be
home
sometime.
Well,
I
call,
but
Phyllis
told
me
Phyllis?
You
call
your
own
mother
Phyllis
isn't
my
mom.
Oh.
But
he
promised
to
pin
on
So,
he
can
show
me
Hey,
why
don't
you
get
some
sleep?
Don't
wanna
wake
up

Mr.
Fredricksen?
Dug
says
he
wants
We
have
to
protect
him.

Can
Kevin
go
with
us?
All
right,
he
can
come.
Promise
you
won't
leave
him?
-
Yeah.
Cross
my
heart.
What
have
I
got
myself
into,
Ellie?



Morning,
sweetheart.
We
better
get
moving.
Bird's
gone.
Maybe
Russell
won't
notice.
Where's
Kevin?
He's
wandered
off!
DUG:
Find
the
bird,
find
the
bird!
Look.
There
he
is!

DUG:
Point!
Hey!
That's
my
food!
Get
off
my
roof!
DUG:
Yeah,
get
off
of
his...



What
is
it
doing?
DUG:
The
bird
is
calling
to
her
babies.
Her
babies.
Kevin's
a
girl?

DUG:
Her
house
is
over
there
She
has
been
gathering
food
for

Wait.
Kevin's
just
leaving?

But
you
promised
to
protect
her.
Her
babies
need
her.
Sorry,
Russell.
Yeah.


This
was
her
favorite
chocolate.
Because
you
sent
her
away,
Huh?
Kevin?





ALPHA:
Where's
the
bird?
DUG:
Oh,
yes.
Oh,
yes.
Since
I
have
said
that,
ALPHA:
Where
is
it?
Come
back
tomorrow,
and
then

ALPHA:
You
lost
it!
Well,
at
least
you
now
have
led
us
and
the
one
who
smells
of
prunes.

ALPHA:
Master
will
be
most
pleased
and
will
ask
of
them
many
questions.
Wait.
We're
not
going
with
you!


Get
away
from
me!

CARL:
Get
down!



MUNTZ:
Stay!
You
came
here
in
that?
Uh,
yeah.
MUNTZ:
In
a
house?
A
floating
house?


That
is
the
darnedest
thing
You're
not
after
my
bird,
are
you?
But
if
you
needed
to
borrow
I'd
be
happy
to
oblige.

Well,
this
is
all
a
misunderstanding.
My
dogs
made
a
mistake.
Wait.
Are
you
Charles
Muntz?
Yeah,
well,
yes.
THE
Charles
Muntz?
"Adventure
is
out
there!"
It's
really
him!
That's
Charles
Muntz!
-
It
is?
Who's
Charles
Muntz?
-
DOGS:
Yes!
Yes!
That's
him!
My
wife
and
I,
Oh,
well.
You're
a
man
of
good
taste.

Now,
you
must
be
tired.
Hungry?
Uh-huh.
Now,
attention,
everyone!
These
people
are
no
longer
intruders!

DOG
1:
Follow
me.
You
do
smell
like
prunes.
CARL:
Whoa!
DOG
2:
I
will
not
bite
you.
DOG
3:
The
small
mailman
MUNTZ:
I'm
sorry
about
the
dogs.
-
Hope
they
weren't
too
rough
on
you.
MUNTZ:
Go
ahead
and
moor
We're
not
actually
going
inside
Oh...
Would
you
like
to?
Would
I?

CARL:
Wait
up,
Mr.
Muntz.
Jiminy
Cricket.
BETA:
Not
you.
ALPHA:
He
has
lost
the
bird.

DUG:
I
do
not
like
the
Cone
of
Shame.
MUNTZ:
Well,
most
of
the
collection
New
York,
Munich,
London.
Did
you
ever!
Will
you
look
at
that?
MUNTZ:
Oh,
yes,
the
Arsinoitherium.
Beast
charged
Used
my
shaving
kit
to
bring
him
down.
Oh,
yeah.
Well,
surprise
me.
Only
way
to
get
it
out
was
to
have
it
declared
Oh,
my
gosh!
Oh,
you
recognize
it.
I'm
impressed.
That's
an
interesting
story
there.
Excellent
choice.
I
found
it
on
safari
with
Roosevelt.
He
and
I
fell
into
a
habit
and
did
he
cheat!
Oh,
he
was
horrible.
ALPHA:
Master,
dinner
is
ready.
Oh,
dear.
Broken
translator.
It's
that
loose
wire
again.
ALPHA:

I
liked
his
other
voice.

Well,
dinner
is
served.
Right
this
way.
So,
how
are
things
stateside,
huh?
Almost
tempted
to
go
back
a
few
times,
but
I
have
unfinished
work
here.
Please.
I
hope
you're
hungry,
because
Epsilon
is
the
finest
chef

Oh,
Epsilon,
you've
done
it
again!
Yes!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh,
my
Ellie
would've
loved
all
this.
You
know,
it's
because
of
you
to
come
down
here
I'm
honored.
And
now
you've
made
it.
You're
sure
we're
not
a
bother?
No,
no.
It's
a
pleasure
to
have
guests,
DOG
1:
Treat!
Where's
the
treat!

MUNTZ:
No,
no.
Quiet!
-
DOG
3:
I
want
a
treat!
I
want
a
treat!
I
shouldn't
have
used
that
word.
Having
guests
is
a
delight.
More
often
I
get
thieves
No!
They
called
me
a
fraud,
those...

But
once
I
bring
back
this
creature,
Beautiful,
isn't
it?
I've
spent
a
lifetime
tracking
it.
Sometimes
years
go
by
I've
tried
to
smoke
it
out
of
that
You
can't
go
in
after
it.
Once
in,
there's
no
way
out.
I've
lost
so
many
dogs.
And
here
they
come,
these
bandits,
But
they
soon
find
that
this
mountain
Hey,
that
looks
like
Kevin.
-
Kevin?
I
trained
it
to
follow
us.
Follow
you?
It's
impossible.
How?
-
She
likes
chocolate.
Yeah.
I
gave
her
some
of
my
chocolate.
But
it
ran
off.
It's
gone
now.
You
know,
Carl,
these
people
they
all
tell
pretty
good
stories.
A
surveyor
making
a
map.
A
botanist
cataloguing
plants.
An
old
man
taking
his
house
I
mean,
that's
the
best
one
yet.

Well,
it's
been
a
wonderful
evening,
Oh,
you're
not
leaving.
We
don't
want
to
take
advantage
-
Come
on,
Russell.
The
boy's
right.
Epsilon
here
makes
Oh,
you
really
must
stay.
I
insist.
We
have
so
much
more
to
talk
about.

Kevin?

It's
here.
Get
them!

-
Hurry!
Ahhh!
They're
coming!
DUG:
Master,
over
here.

DUG:
Go
toward
the
light,
Master!


Russell!

Get
back!
DUG:
Go
on,
Master!
Stop,
you
dogs.

Whoa!

RUSSELL:
Help!
Help!
Caw,
caw!
Raar!
Give
me
your
hand!
Hang
on
to
Kevin!






RUSSELL:
Kevin.



Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Kevin.
Stay
down.
She's
hurt
real
bad.

All
right,
but
we
gotta
hurry.


You
lost
them?
BETA:
No,
it
was
Dug.
GAMMA:
Yeah.
He's
with
them.

Wait.
Wait
a
minute.
Dug.


See
anything?
DUG:
No.
My
pack
is
not
following
us.
This
is
crazy.
I
finally
meet
my
childhood
hero,
DUG:
Hey,
I
know
a
joke.
A
squirrel
walks
up
to
a
tree
and
says,
"I
forgot
to
store
acorns
for
winter
Ha!
It
is
funny

CARL:
Careful,
Russell.
You
okay,
Kevin?

You
know
what,
Mr.
Fredricksen?
The
wilderness
isn't
quite
CARL:
Yeah?
How
so?
It's
kind
of
wild.
I
mean,
it's
not
how
they
made
it
sound

Get
used
to
that,
kid.
My
dad
made
it
sound
so
easy.
He's
really
good
at
camping
and
how
to
make
fire
He
used
to
come
to
all
And
afterwards,
I
always
get
chocolate
Then
we
sit
on
this
one
curb
and
I'll
count
all
the
blue
cars
and
whoever
gets
the
most
wins.
I
like
that
curb.
That
might
sound
boring,
but
I
think
the
boring
stuff


Look!
There
it
is!
Hey,
kid.
Hold
on,
Russell.
Stand
still.

Look
at
that
bird
go.

That's
it.
Go,
Kevin!
Run,
Kevin!
Run!
Oh,
no!
Russell,
give
me
your
knife!
MUNTZ:
Get
away
from
my
bird!


No!

RUSSELL:
No!

MUNTZ:
Careful.
We'll
want
her
RUSSELL:
Let
her
go!
Stop!
Kevin!


RUSSELL:
You
gave
away
Kevin.
You
just
gave
her
away.
This
is
none
of
my
concern.
DUG:
Master,
it's
alright.
I
am
not
your
master!
And
if
you
hadn't
have
shown
up,
Bad
dog!
Bad
dog!

Now,
whether
you
assist
me
or
not,
I
am
going
to
Paradise
Falls


Here.
I
don't
want
this
anymore.


Russell?
Russell!
I'm
gonna
help
Kevin,
even
if
you
won't!

No,
Russell!
No!



Huh?
Russell?
Dug!
DUG:
I
was
hiding
under
your
porch
Can
you
stay?
And
I'm
your
master.
DUG:
You're
my
master?
Oh,
boy!
Oh,
boy!
CARL:
Good
boy,
Dug!

Yes!
Don't
worry,
Kevin.
I'll
save...

And
they
wouldn't
believe
me.
ALPHA:
Master?
-
The
small
mailman
has
returned.
Let
me
go.
Where's
your
elderly
friend?
He's
not
my
friend
anymore.
Well,
if
you're
here,
RUSSELL:
Where
are
you
Let
me
go!
BETA:
Scream
all
you
want,
GAMMA:
None
of
your
mailman
friends
I'll
unleash
MUNTZ:
Alpha,
Guard
that
bird.
If
you
see
the
old
man,
Hey,
where
are
you
going?
MUNTZ:
Nice
talking
with
you.
Ahhh!
Where
are
you,
Fredricksen?

Russell!
-
Mr.
Fredricksen!
You
came
back
for
Kevin!
CARL:
I'm
getting
Kevin.
You
stay
here.
But
I
wanna
help.
I
don't
want
your
help.
I
want
you
safe.


How
do
we
get
past
these
dogs?
DUG:
Point!
Kevin.

Don't
worry,
Kevin.
We're
on
our
way.
ALPHA:
Allow
no
one
to
be
entering
Guard
well
that
bird,
my
minions.
What
do
we
do
now,
Dug?

Who
wants
the
ball?

DOG
1:
Me!
I
want
it!
DOG
3:
I
want
the
ball!
Then
go
get
it!
GAMMA:
I'm
gonna
get
there
first!
GAMMA:
Getting
the
ball!
GAMMA:
I
got
it!
Uh-oh.

I'm
sorry,
Kevin.
GAMMA:
Master!
He's
gone!
DOG
1:
He's
here!
GAMMA:
He's
got
the
bird!
Calm
down!
One
at
a
time!
I...
want...
to...
help!
Ha-ha!


DOG
3:
He's
in
Hall
D!
DOG
5:
It's
the
old
man!
Does
anyone
know
where
they
are?


Gray
Leader?
Take
down
the
house.

BETA:
Gray
Leader,
checking
in.
GAMMA:
Gray
Two,
checking
in.
GRAY
THREE:
Gray
Three,
checking
in.
BETA:
Target
sighted.

Come
on,
Kevin.

Auuggghh!


DUG:
Hi.



Any
last
words,
Fredricksen?
Come
on!
-
Come
on.
I
am
taking
that
bird
back
with
me.
Come
on,
Kevin.



ALPHA:
I
will
have
many
enjoyments

DOG
1:
He
wears
the
Cone
of
Shame!
ALPHA:

What?

ALPHA:
No,
no!
Stop
your
laughing!
DUG:
Listen,
you
dog.
Sit!
ALL:
Yes,
Alpha.
DUG:
Alpha?
I
am
not
Alpha.
He
is...
Oh!

I
can't
do
it.
-
CARL:
Russell!
CARL:
Caw,
caw!
Raar!
You
leave
Mr.
Fredricksen
alone!
Hey,
squirrel!
GAMMA:
Squirrel?
Where?
BETA:
Where's
the
squirrel?
GAMMA:
I
hate
squirrels.


Dug!
DUG:
Master!
Russell!
Over
here!
Let's
go!
Mr.
Fredricksen!
CARL:
Go
on,
Kevin!

No!
Russell!
Get
out
of
there!
No!
Leave
them
alone!
Russell,
hang
on
to
Kevin!
Kevin!
Chocolate!



RUSSELL:
That
was
cool!

Don't
jerk
around
so
much,
kid!
DUG:
Oh,
I
am
ready
to
not
be
up
high.
Sorry
about
your
house,
You
know,
it's
just
a
house.


Look
at
you.
You're
so
soft.

ALL:
Aw!
I
wish
I
could
keep
one.

Where's
my
cane?
I
just
had
it
here.

You
know
what?
Keep
them.
Bye,
Kevin!

Ready?
Ready.
