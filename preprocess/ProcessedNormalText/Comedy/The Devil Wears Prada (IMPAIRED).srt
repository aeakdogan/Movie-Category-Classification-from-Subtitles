Hi.
Uh,
I
have
an
appointment
-
Andrea
Sachs?
Great.
Human
Resources
certainly
Follow
me.
Okay,
so
I
was
Miranda's
but
her
first
assistant
recently
got
promoted,
-
Oh,
and
you're
replacing
yourself.
Miranda
sacked
the
last
two
girls
We
need
to
find
someone
who
can
survive
here.
Yeah.
Of
course.
Who's
Miranda?
Oh,
my
God.
I
will
pretend
She's
the
editor
in
chief
of
Runway,
You
work
a
year
for
her,
and
you
can
A
million
girls
would
kill
for
this
job.
It
sounds
like
a
great
opportunity.

Andrea,
so
an
interest
in
fashion
is
crucial.
What
makes
you
think
-

No!
No!
No!
What's
wrong?
She's
on
her
way.
Tell
everyone!
She's
not
supposed
to
be
here
Her
driver
just
text
messaged,
-
God,
these
people!
That
I
can't
even
talk
about.
All
right,
everyone!
Gird
your
loins!
-



Sorry,
Miranda.

Move
it!
Ooh!
I
don't
understand
why
it's
so
difficult
I
know.
I'm
so
sorry,
Miranda.
Details
of
your
incompetence
Tell
Simone
I'm
not
going
to
approve
that
girl
I
asked
for
clean,
athletic,
smiling.
And
R.S.V.P.
Yes
I
want
the
driver
to
drop
me
off
at
9:30
-

9:45
sharp.
No,
I
don't
want
dacquoise.
I
want
tortes
Then
call
my
ex-husband
and
remind
him
the
Then
call
my
husband,
ask
him
to
meet
me
Tell
Richard
I
saw
the
pictures
that
he
sent
and
they're
all
so
deeply
unattractive.
Is
it
impossible
to
find
a
lovely,
-
No.
Also,
I
need
to
see
all
the
things
that
Nigel
I
wonder
if
she's
lost
any
Nobody.
Um,
uh-
Human
Resources
sent
her
up
about
the
new
But
she's
hopeless
Clearly
I'm
going
to
have
to
do
that
myself
were
completely
inadequate.
So
send
her
in.
That's
all.
Right.
-
She
wants
to
see
you.
Move!
-
This
is
foul.
Don't
let
her
see
it.
Go!

Who
are
you?
Uh,
my
name
is
Andy
Sachs.
I
recently
graduated
And
what
are
you
doing
here?
Well,
I
think
I
could
do
a
good
job
And,
um-
Yeah,
I
came
to
New
York
to
be
a
journalist
and
then
finally
got
a
call
and
met
with
Sherry
Basically,
it's
this
or
Auto
Universe.
-
So
you
don't
read
Runway?
And
before
today,
No.
And
you
have
no
style
Well,
um,
I
think
that
depends
No,
no.
That
wasn't
a
question.
Um,
I
was
editor
in
chief
I
also,
um,
won
a
national
competition
with
my
series
on
the
janitors'
union,
That's
all.

Yeah.
You
know,
okay.
You're
right.
I
don't
fit
in
here.
I
am
not
skinny
or
glamorous...
and
I
don't
know
that
much
But
I'm
smart.
I
learn
fast
I
got
the
exclusive
but
the
problem
is,
with
that
huge
she
looks
like
she's
working
Thank
you
for
your
time.
Who
is
that
sad
little
person?
Are
we
doing
a
before-and-after
piece
Brown
and
Law,
please?
-
Andrea.
Wait.
You
got
a
job
-
Mm-hmm.
-

Wow.
Miranda
Priestly
is
famous
Okay,
Doug.
How
is
it
-
I'm
actually
a
girl.
-
That
would
explain
so
much.
Miranda
Priestly
is
a
huge
deal.
Yeah,
great.

I
mean,
I
mean,
come
on.
Yeah.
And
Lily,
she
works
at
that
gallery
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
What
exactly
is
it
Well,
lucky
for
me,

-
Oh,
you're
right.
My
job
sucks.
-
It
sucks.
I
don't-
It's
boring.
-
I'm
trying.
-
I
will
have
a
drink.
I
will
have
a
drink.
-
I'd
like
to
propose
a
toast.

Oh,
baby.
You
should
see
the
way
I
don't
have
a
thing
to
wear
to
work.
Come
on.
You're
gonna
be
You
need
a
ball
gown
for
that?
I
think
I
might.
Well,
I
happen
to
think
Aww!
I
think
you're
full
of
it.

-
Hey.
Come
on.
Let's
go
home.
I
can
think
of
something
we
can
do
-
Really?
-

Hello?
Andrea,
Miranda
decided
to
kill
and
she
is
pulling
up
You
need
to
come
into
the
office
right
this
-
Now?
-
Now?
I
want
one
no-foam
skimmed
latte
and
three
drip
coffees
-
Searing
hot.
And
I
mean
hot.
-
Hello?
-

Where
are
you?
Shoot!
Oh!

Is
there
some
reason
Has
she
died
or
something?
No.

God.
Oh.
Bloody
time.
-
I
hope
you
know
that
this
For
which
you
are
totally
wrong.
And
if
you
mess
up,
Now,
hang
that
up.
Okay.
First
of
all,
The
phone
must
be
answered
Calls
roll
to
voice
mail,
If
I'm
not
here-Andrea,
Andrea-
you
are
chained
to
that
desk.
-
Well,
what
if
I
need
to-
One
time
an
assistant
left
the
desk
because
and
Miranda
missed
Lagerfeld...
just
before
he
boarded
She
now
works
at
TV
Guide.
-
Man
the
desk
at
all
times.
Got
it.
-
Uh-
No,
she's
not
available.
-
Who
is
it?
Yes,
I
will
tell
her
-

I
mean,
you
get
coffee-
Yet
I
am
in
charge
of
her
schedule...
her
appointments
and
her
expenses.
And,
um,
most
importantly,
um...
I
get
to
go
with
her
to
Paris
I
get
to
wear
couture.
I
meet
all
of
the
designers.
Okay.
Now,
stay
here.
I'm
going
to
-
The-
Now,
it
is
a
mock-up
of
everything...
in
the
current
issue.
And
we
deliver
it
to
Miranda's
apartment
Don't
touch
it.
She
returns
it
to
us
Now,
the
second
assistant
but
Miranda
is
very
private
So
until
she
decides
I
get
the
lovely
task
-

-
Deal
with
it.


Hello.
Mrs.
Priestly's
office.
Hmm.
That's
what
I
meant.

Um,
you
know,
she
is
in
a
meeting.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Can
you
please
spell
Gabbana?
-

I
guess
not.
I
guessed
an
eight
and
a
half.
Um,
uh,
that's
very
nice
of
you...
but
I
don't
think
I
need
these.
Miranda
hired
me.
-
Do
you?
Emily.
Emily?
She
means
you.
-
We
just
cut
on
the
bias.
I
couldn't
have
been
clearer.
-
How
many
times
do
I
have
to
scream
your
name?
My
name
is
Andy.

-
What
kind
of
skirts
do
you-
And
make
sure
we
have
Pier
59
Remind
Jocelyn
I
need
to
see
a
few
of
those
And
then
tell
Simone
I'll
take
Jackie
-
Did
Demarchelier
confirm?
Demarchelier.
Uh,
o-
okay.
-
And,
Emily?
That's
all.
It's
just
the
cavalier
disregard

Do
you
have
Demarchelier?
Uh,
Demarchelier.
-

Leave
it.
I
have
Miranda
Priestly
calling.
I
have
Patrick!
Uh,
no,
she
called
me
in
there
And
there
was
something
And,
um,
she
needs
skirts
And,
uh,
there
was
something
-
Did
she
say
which
skirts?
-
Did
she
say
what
kind?
Color,
shape,
fabric?
You
may
never
ask
Miranda
anything.
Right.
I
will
deal
with
all
of
this,
Eh-
Me?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Do
you
have
Some
hideous
skirt
convention
Uh-
-

-
Are
you
there?

-

-
Hello?
Hi.
Miranda
needs
you
to
go
to
Hermes
-
Okay.
Miranda
went
out
to
meet
with
Meisel,
and
-
Hot
Starbucks.
-

Oh,
my
God.
What
took
you
so
long?
What?
No,
I
haven't.
I've
been
manning
Oh,
hi.
-

Okay.
Now,
be
prepared.
People
are
panicking,
so
the
phone
The
ru-
The
run-through.
Right.
Yes.
Editors
bring
in
options
for
the
shoot,
She
chooses
every
single
thing
Run-throughs
are
a
huge
deal.
-

Okay.
Are
you
ready?
Right.
Well,
after
the
loo,
-
This
is
her-
the
new
me.
-
Told
you.
No,
quite
serious,
yeah.
-
When
I
come
back,
you
can
go.



Hmm.
Corn
chowder.
That's
an
interesting
choice.
You
do
know
that
cellulite
is
one

So
none
of
the
girls
here
eat
anything?
Not
since
two
became
the
new
four
-
Well,
I'm
a
six.
Oh.
Shoot.
Oh,
never
mind.
I'm
sure
you
have
plenty
-

I
get
it.
But,
you
know,
I'm
not
going
so
I
don't
see
the
point
of
changing
everything
Yes,
that's
true.
That's
really
what
this
multibillion-dollar
-
Inner
beauty.
Hello.
Right.
Come
on.
-
Miranda's
pushed
the
run-through
-
She's
always
15
minutes
early.
-
You're
already
late.
Come.
Excuse
me.
-

Nigel.
-
Issue
going
well?
Great.
Heard
Miranda
killed
autumn
jackets
What's
that
costing
me?
About
300,000.
Must
have
been
some
lousy
jackets.
-
Irv
Ravitz.
This
is
Andy
Sachs,
Congratulations,
young
lady.
A
million
girls
would
kill
for
that
job.
Bye-bye.
-
Hmm?
You
know
what
they
say?
No.
And
I've
seen
all
this
before.
Theyskens
is
trying
to
reinvent
-
Where
are
all
the
other
dresses?
-
Stand,
watch
and
listen.
No.
No,
I
just-
Why
is
it
so
impossible
You
people
have
had
hours
and
hours
Where
are
the
advertisers?
-
We
have
some
pieces
from
Banana
Republic.
-
Oh.
This
is-This
might
be-
Well,
you
know
me.
Give
me
a
full
ballerina
skirt
-
But
do
you
think
it's
too
much
like-
I
thought
that,
but
no,
not
with
Where
are
the
belts
for
this
dre-
Here.
It's
a
tough
call.
-
They're
so
different.

Something
funny?
No.
No,
no.
Nothing's-
You
know,
it's
just
that
both
those
belts
You
know,
I'm
still
learning
"This...
stuff"?
Oh.
Okay.
I
see.
You
think
this
has
nothing
You
go
to
your
closet...
and
you
select-
I
don't
know-
because
you're
trying
to
tell
the
world
to
care
about
what
But
what
you
don't
know
It's
not
turquoise.
It's
not
lapis.
It's
actually
cerulean.
And
you're
also
blithely
unaware
that
in
2002,
Oscar
de
la
Renta
And
then
I
think
it
was
who
showed
cerulean
military
jackets?
-
I
think
we
need
a
jacket
here.
And
then
cerulean
quickly
showed
up
And
then
it,
uh,
filtered
down
and
then
trickled
on
down
and
then
trickled
on
down
where
you,
no
doubt,
However,
that
blue
represents
and
countless
jobs...
and
it's
sort
of
comical
how
you
think
that
exempts
you
when,
in
fact...
you're
wearing
a
sweater
that
was
selected
from
a
pile
of
stuff.
So
then
I
said,
between
the
two
and
you
should
have
seen
I
thought
the
flesh
-

She's
not
happy
unless
everyone
around
her
And
the
Clackers
just
worship
her.
-
The
who?
The
sound
that
their
stilettos
make
It's
like,

And
they
all
act
like

that
these
people
spend
on
these
insignificant,
So
that
tomorrow
they
can
spend
that
was
probably
fine
to
begin
with...
to
sell
people
things
they
don't
need!
God!
-
I'm
not
even
hungry
anymore.
-
That
is
why
those
girls
are
so
skinny.
Give
me
that.
There's,
like,

I
just
have
to
stick
it
out
for
a
year.
And
then
I
can
do
But
I
can't
let
Miranda
get
to
me.
Easy
there,
tiger.
-
Oh,
good
morning,
Miranda.
I
don't
see
my
breakfast
here.
Excuse
me!
Pick
up
the
Polaroids
Have
the
brakes
checked
on
my
car.
-

Where's
that
piece
of
paper
The
girls
need
new
surfboards
or
-
Hello.
-
Ow!
Pick
up
my
shoes
from
Blahnik,
-
Who's
that?
Get
me
that
little
table
Get
us
a
reservation
for
dinner
tonight
-
Get
me
Isaac.
-
Where
is
everyone?

Get
me
Demarchelier.
I
have
Miranda
Priestly
calling
for-
I
have
Patrick.

At
least
Miranda
will
be
in
Miami,
You
know,
Yeah,
we're
gonna
go
out
to
dinner,
You
doing
anything
fun
this
weekend?
Yes.


He
actually-
He
applied
here,
but
they
-
Here.
I
don't
want
you
-
Dad,
how
did
you-
I'm
gonna
kill
Mom.
Dad,
thank
you.
Mm-hmm.
-
It's
really
good
to
see
you.
So,
you
want
to
or
should
we
wait
till
after
dinner?
I
thought
I'd
let
you
at
least
enjoy
No,
no,
no.
It's
okay.
We're
just
a
little
worried,
honey.
We
get
e-mails
from
you
Your
pay
is
terrible.
Hey,
that's
not
fair.
I
wrote
those
e-mails.
I'm
just
trying
to
understand
why
someone
turns
it
down
to
be
a
journalist,
Dad,
you
have
to
trust
me.
Being
Miranda's
assistant
Emily
is
going
to
Paris
and
she's
gonna
meet
editors
and
writers
And
in
a
year,
that
could
be
me.
-
All
right?
Dad,
I
swear,
this
is
my
break.
-
This
is
my-
my
chance.
This
is
my
boss.
-
I'm
sorry,
Dad.
I
have
to
take
this.
-
Hello.
Miranda?
It's
some
absurd
weather
problem.
I
need
to
get
home
tonight.
The
twins
have
-
What?
-
Absolutely.
Let
me
see
what
I
can
do.
Hi.
Um,
I
know
this
but
I
was
hoping
that
you
from
Miami
to
New
York
tonight?
Uh-
-

It's
right
here.
Thank
you.
-
From
Miami
to
New
York.
-
Yup,
I
need
it
tonight.
I
need
it-
-
I
thought
you
were
going
out
the
other-
-
It's
over
here,
honey.
Hi.
I'm
trying
to
get
a
flight
tonight-
Yes,
I
know
there's
a
hurricane.
Nothing
is
flying
out?
It's
for
Miranda
Priestly,
Yes.
Yes,
hi.
I
need
a
jet
tonight
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hold
on.
I'm
trying
to
get
you
a
flight,
but
no
one
Please.
It's
just-
-

Call
Donatella.
Get
her
jet.
Call
everybody
else
Call
every-
This
is
your
responsibi-
Get
me
home.
Oh,
my
God!
What
does
she
want
you
to
do,
call
the
National
Of
course
not.
Could
I
do
that?
Come
on.
Come
on.
The
girls'
recital
They
played
Rachmaninoff.
Everyone
except
me...
because,
sadly,
I
was
not
there.
Miranda,
I'm
so
sorry.
Do
you
know
why
I
hired
you?
I
always
hire
the
same
girl-
stylish,
slender,
of
course...
worships
the
magazine.
But
so
often,
they
turn
out
to
be-
I
don't
know-
disappointing
and,
um...
stupid.
So
you,
with
that
impressive
rsum...
and
the
big
speech
I,
um-
I
thought
you
I
said
to
myself,
go
ahead.
Take
a
chance.
Hire
the
smart,
fat
girl.

My
God.
I
live
on
it.
Anyway,
you
ended
up
more
than
any
of
the
other
silly
girls.
Um,
I
really
did
everything
-
Uh-
Excuse
me!
She
hates
me,
Nigel.
And
that's
my
problem
because-
Oh,
wait.
No,
it's
not
my
problem.
I
don't
know
what
else
I
can
do
because
She
doesn't
even
say
thank
you.
But
if
I
do
something
wrong,
-
So
quit.
-
Quit.
I
can
get
another
girl
to
take
your
job
No,
I
don't
want
to
quit.
But,
you
know,
I'm
just
saying
for
the
fact
Andy,
be
serious.
You
are
not
trying.
-
You
are
whining.
What
is
it
that
you
want
me
Do
you
want
me
to
say,
"
Poor
you.
Hmm?
Wake
up,
six.
She's
just
doing
her
job.
Don't
you
know
that
you
that
published
some
Halston,
Lagerfeld,
de
la
Renta.
And
what
they
did,
what
they
created...
was
greater
than
art
Well,
not
you,
obviously,
You
think
This
is
not
just
a
magazine.
This
is
a
shining
beacon
of
hope
for-
oh,
I
don't
know-
let's
say
a
young
boy
growing
up
pretending
to
go
to
soccer
practice
and
reading
Runway
under
the
covers
You
have
no
idea
how
many
legends
And
what's
worse,
you
don't
care.
Because
this
place,
where
so
many
you
only
deign
to
work.
And
you
want
to
know
why
and
give
you
a
gold
star
on
your
homework
Wake
up,
sweetheart.

-
Okay.
So
I'm
screwing
it
up.
I
don't
want
to.
I
just
wish
that
I
knew
-

Nigel?
Nigel,
Nigel.
No.
I
don't
know
what
you
expect
me
to
do.
There's
nothing
in
this
whole
closet
I
can
guarantee
you.
These
are
all
sample
sizes-
-
All
right.
We're
doing
this
for
you.
And-
You'll
take
what
I
give
you
-
We're
doing
this
Dolce
for
you.
And
shoes.
-
Jimmy
Choo's.
-
Manolo
Blahnik.
Nancy
Gonzalez.
Love
that.
Okay,
Narciso
Rodriguez.
-
Uh,
it
might
fit.
It
might.
Okay.
Now,
Chanel.
You're
in
desperate
We
have
to
get
to
the
beauty
department,

I
mean,
I
have
no
idea
Me
neither.
The
other
day,
She
held
up
the
Shu
Uemura
eyelash
curler

I
just
knew
she
was
going
to
be
-

No,
actually,
she's
not
available,
Okay,
thanks.
Bye.
How
did-
-
Are
you
wearing
the-
Yeah,
I
am.
You
look
good.
-
Oh,
God.
-
She
does.
-
See
you
guys
tomorrow.
Take
care
of
that
finger,
huh?
So,
what
do
you
think?
Uh,
I
think
we
better
get
out
of
here...
before
my
girlfriend
sees
me.

-


-
Mm-hmm.
-
Gotta
find-
So
we
spent
a
whole
semester
You
take
the
fry
and
squeeze
it.
-
See
how
firm
that
is?
There
was
a
crisis
-
I
needed
to
find
a
python
headband.
I
have
exciting
presents
for
all
of
you.
Are
you
ready?
-
What
is
that?
Charlie
Rose
sent
it
to
Miranda
I
looked
it
up
on
line.
-
What?
And
I
have
some
products.
-
A
little
Clinique.
-
Oh,
damn
it.
I
love
your
job.
-
A
little
thing.
-
Do
you
want
it?
You
want-
Oh.
-
I
think
she
likes
it.
This
is
sold
out
everywhere.
Miranda
didn't
want
it,
so-
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This
bag
is,
like,
$1,900.
-

-
Why
do
women
need
so
many
bags?
You
have
one.
You
put
all
your
junk
in
it,
Fashion
is
not
about
utility.
An
accessory
is
merely
used
to
express
individual
identity.
-
Oh!
And
it's
pretty.
Yeah.
But
the
thing
is,
it
turns
out
there
is
Look,
here's
an
essay
by
Jay
McInerney,
Even
an
interview
-
Looks
like
someone's
been
drinking
the
Kool-Aid.
-

-
Oh,
Miranda?
-
I
need
that.
Lily,
no,
no,
no!
Put
that
thing
up!
It's
gonna
make-

-

-
Ooh.
Shh.
-
Shh!
You
know,
you
guys



Um,
excuse
me.
I'm
looking
for
James
Holt.
Um,
that's
him
right
there.
-
Oh.
Thanks.
-
I
put
my
stuff
out
there,
and
I
pray
they
improve.
-
Excuse
me.
I'm
Andy.
Oh,
yes.
-

-
Oh,
let
me
see
that
bag.
Very,
very
nice.
Distressed,
studded
leather,
pieced
by
hand,

Very
nice,
indeed.
You.
Hmm.
Duh.
This
way.
Uh,
here
we
go.
It's
a
sketch
of
Miranda's
dress
Also
the
centerpiece
of
my
spring
collection.
-
I'll
guard
it
with
my
life.
Come
on.
You
must
be
in
desperate
need
Excuse
us,
girls.
She'll
have
the
punch.

It's
deadly.
Have
fun.

-
He's
right,
you
know.
The
punch.
I
woke
up
in
Hoboken
wearing
nothing
-
-
Wise.
-
Uh,
hi.
Christian
Thompson?
No,
you're-You
write
for,
I
actually-
I
reviewed
your
collection
Did
you
mention
my
good
looks
-
No,
but-
Oh.
Well,
I
want
to
work
for
somewhere
-
I
am
a
writer
too.
-
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
That
would
be-Thank
you.
But
actually,
right
now,
I'm
working
Oh,
you're
kidding.
That's-Whoa.
-
Excuse
me?
You
can't
do
that
job.
Gotta
go.
Okay.
Well,
it
was
very,
very
nice
Emily?
Call
James
Holt's
office.
Tell
them
I
want
Tell
everybody
else.
But
we're
not
expected
until
Tuesday.
Yes.
Yeah,
she
explained
every
detail
And
then
we
brushed
each
other's
hair
I
see
your
point.
-

What's
a
preview
anyway?

Miranda
insists
upon
seeing
before
they
show
them.
-
Great
to
see
you.
-

And
she
tells
them
what
she
thinks?
Uh,
this
season
really
began
for
me
on
the
intersection

There's
a
scale.
There's
only
been
one
actual
smile
on
record,
An
obi
belt.

This
is
the
dress
that
we
have
designed

Then,
of
course,



-
I
just
don't
understand.
I'm
appalled.
-
You
deal
with
it.
So
because
she
pursed
her
lips,
You
still
don't
get
it,
do
you?
Her
opinion
is
the
only
one
-
Call
my
husband
and
confirm
dinner.
And
I'll
need
a
change
of
clothes.
Well,
I've
already
messengered
Fine.
And,
Andrea,
I
would
like
you
-
Have
Emily
give
you
the
key.
-
Guard
this
with
your
life.
You
know,
if
I
can
deliver
the
Book,
I'm
not
a
psycho.
Oh,
and,
you
know,
I
mean,
she
didn't
call
me
Emily,
Yeah,
whoopee.
Right.
Now,
it's
very
important
that
you
do
Oh.
Okay.

and
you
must
wait
around
for
it
You
will
be
delivering
Miranda's
Now,
the
car
will
take
you
straight
You
let
yourself
in.
Andrea.
You
do
not
talk
to
anyone.
Do
not
look
at
anyone.
This
is
of
the
utmost
importance.
-
Do
you
understand?
You
open
the
door
You
hang
the
dry
cleaning
-
Uh-

-
Shit!
Okay.

-
You
can
give
the
Book
to
us.
-
It's
okay.
Come
on
up.
-
What?
It's
okay.
-
Yeah,
come
on.
It's
okay.
Or
you
can
bring
the
Book
upstairs.
She
does?
Right.
Yeah?
Okay.


What
did
you
expect
me
to
do,

I
rushed
out
of
and
I
sat
there
waiting
for
you
I
told
you
the
cell
phones
didn't
work.

I
knew
what
everyone
there
he
is,
waiting
for
her
again.
-
Okay,
okay!
Okay,
okay.
It
really
wasn't
that
big
a
deal.
The
twins
said
hello,
-
Then
I
went
up
the
stairs
Oh,
my
God.
Why
didn't
you
just
climb
into
bed
Okay,
I
made
a
mistake.
I
know.
Andrea,
you
don't
understand.
If
you
get
fired,
If
that
happens,
I
will
search
every
Blimpie's
She's
gonna
fire
me?
I
don't
know.
She's
not
happy.


Miranda,
about
last
night,
I-
I
need
the
new
Harry
Potter
book
Okay.
Okay.
I'll
go
down
Did
you
fall
down
and
smack
Not
that
I
can
recall.
We
have
all
the
published
Harry
Potter
books.
You
want
the
unpublished
manuscript?
We
know
everyone
in
publishing.
And
you
can
do
anything,
right?

Yes,
Bobbsey.
I
know,
baby.
Mommy's
working
very
hard
She
doesn't
get
it.
I
could
call
frickin'
J.K.
Rowling
herself.
My
girls
are
leaving
on
the
train
so
the
book
better
be
here
-
Of
course!
No
problem!
Okay.
I
have
four
hours
Smith
&
Wollensky's
doesn't
open
until
11:30.
Okay.
I
will
be
back
in
15
minutes.
-
Wish
me
luck!
Yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
I've
been
on
hold.
It's
very
important.
Yes,
I
know
it's
impossible
to
get...
but,
well,
I
was
wondering
if
you
if
that's
at
all
possible.
Yes,
I'm
calling
about
Uh,
no.
Unpublished.
Not
a
chance?
Tell
her
that
it's
for
Miranda
Priestly.
'Cause
I
think
it
makes
a
difference.
Let
me
call
you
back.
You
probably
don't
remember
me.
I'm
Miranda
Priestly's
assistant.
The
Harry
Potter
manuscript?
Uh,
sorry
to
ask,
but
I'm
desperate.
Just
tell
her
it
can't
be
done.
Well,
this
is
Miranda
Priestly
There
is
no
Plan
"B."
Is
she
back?
Am
I
fired?
I
rarely
say
this
to
people
but
you
have
got
to
calm
down.
Bloody
hell!
Coat,
bag.
What's
that?
Oh,
I
don't
want
that.
I'll
be
back
at
3:00.
Oh,
and
if
you
don't
have
don't
even
bother
coming
back.

Hello.
Quit?
Are
you
sure?
I
failed.
-
I
might
as
well
beat
her
to
the
punch.
Andy,
good
for
you.
-
Yeah.
Well,
listen,
I'll
call
you
later.
-

I'm
brilliant.
No,
really.
-
Monuments
should
be
erected
in
my
honor.
Oh,
yes.
A
friend
of
a
friend
and
she
happens
Oh,
no,
'cause
that
would
mean

The
thing
is,
Christian,
I
was
just-
Look,
you
want
this
thing,
you
better
hurry.
-
Excuse
me.
-
Welcome
to
the
St.
Regis.
-
Uh,
I'm
meeting
someone
at
the
King
Cole
Bar.
Hi.
-
You
have
one
hour.
