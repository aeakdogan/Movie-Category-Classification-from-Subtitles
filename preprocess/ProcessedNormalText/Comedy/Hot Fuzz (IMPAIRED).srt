Well,

how
many

we
all
appreciate

all
about
being
a

Nicholas.
You

I
was
hoping
to
check
in.
But
you've
always
been
here.
-
Excuse
me?

This

MARY:
Welcome
to
Sandford.
If
there's
anything
you
need,
Thank
you.
Could
I
borrow
your
newspaper?
It's
not
ours,
love.
We're

When's
your

Is
there
a
problem,
Officer?
It
would
appear
a
number
Well,
a
few
of
them
may
be
But
if
they're
in
here,
Yeah,
the
way
we
see
it,
The
greater
good.
Well,
that's
as
may
be,
-
Another
cranberry

I
hope
you're
not
planning
on
driving
that.
No.

Right.
I'm
taking
you
to
the

Where
is
it?

What?
ANGEL:
Move.
"Nicholas
Angel."
-
Oh,
when
did
you
start?
Well,
I
see
you've
already
arrested
Not
exactly.
-
You
in
for
the
night?
-
Hey,
now,
I
need
to
speak
to
him.
I
see.
You
really
want
to
process
all
this
lot?
-
My
pen's
running
out.
-
Morning,
Sergeant.
Morning.
Morning,
Sergeant.
Morning,
Sergeant.
-
Lock
me
up.
I'm
a
slasher
and
I
must
be
stopped.
-
You're
a
what?
Just
kidding.
I'm
Simon
Skinner.
Drop
in
and
see
me
sometime.
Catch
me
later!
Morning,
Sergeant.
Morning,
Sergeant.
Could
you
tell
the
Inspector
No.
Why?
He's
not
in
yet.
-
Well,
how's
our
guest?
-
The
inebriate
in
cell
four.
Can
I
get
cell
four
open,
please?
Danny,
can
you
open
four?
-
He's
gone.
-
Why
are
you
dressed
like
a
police
officer?
Sergeant
Angel,
at
last.
Frank
Butterman.
-
I
see
you've
already
met
my
boy.
FRANK:
Do
forgive
me.
Speaking
of
which,
that
was
a
fair
Thank
you,
sir.
I
admire
your
enthusiasm
but
this
isn't
London.
With
respect,
sir,
geographical
location
shouldn't
factor
No,
thanks.
Statistically,
Sandford
is
But
that
doesn't
mean
than
a
careful
and
considered
approach.
There's
a
reason
we
accommodate
-
The
greater
good?
Your
predecessor
assumed
Ended
up
having
a
nervous
breakdown.
And
Sergeant
Popwell
was
And
he
had
one
thing
you
haven't
got.
-
What's
that,
sir?
Come
on,
let's
have
a
mosey
around.
Locker
room.
Riot
room.
Evidence
room.
Now,
how
about
a
trip
to
the
Andes?
Detective
Sergeant
Wainwright

Don't
get
up.
I
expect
you're
wondering
-
They're
both
called
Andrew?
Also,
because
talking
to
them
is
-
Fuck
off!

And
this
is
where
it
all
happens.
That
is
Sergeant
Tony
Fisher.
PC
Bob
Walker.

And
that
is
Saxon.
And
this
is
one
Doris
Thatcher.
-
She's
our
only
policewoman.
-
Yeah,
she
is.
I've
seen
her
bra.
Being
a
woman
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
Oh,
I
don't
know.
I
could've
given
you
the
tour.
And
what's
upstairs?
Well,
well,
well,
I
see
we
have
visitors.
Nicholas,
this
is
Tom
Weaver.

You'll
find
that
we

this

I
must
say
I
was
rather
admiring
It's
a
pity

Hanging
around.
Loitering.
Sitting.
Actually,
I
did
notice
some
minor
graffiti
Graffiti?
They've
gotta
be
dealt
with,
Frank.
They're
nippers,
Tom.
They'll
come
round.

If
we
don't
come
down
hard
-
we
are
gonna
be
up
to
our
balls
in
jugglers.
We
like
to
let
them
think
they
run
the
place.
Well,
that's
that.
Unless
there's
anything
Yes,
sir.
The
Black

I'm
sorry,

I
don't

Let's
just
say
that
we
won't
be
short
Dad.
Now,
since
it's
your
first
day
So,
what
made
you
choose
Sandford
then,
It
wasn't
actually
my
choice.
Oh,
right,
right,
wasn't
your
choice
to
come
Our
jobs.

ALL:
Yeah.
Look,
I
can
assure
you
it
wasn't
Yeah,
'cause
we
all
sell
apples
round
here,
-
Your
dad
sells
apples,
Andy.
I
bet
you
can't
wait
to
jump
I'm
not
jumping
into
anyone's
grave.
-
You
got
a
moustache.
-
Why
have
you
got
your
stab
vest
on?
In
the
city
maybe.
Not
a
member
of
the
public
anyhow.
-
Have
you
been
stabbed,
Sergeant
Fisher?
Well,
I
have.
And
I
can
assure
you
Have
you
seen
a
lot
of
action,
I've
experienced
my
fair
share,
yes.
-
Did
you
cook
any
fools?
Did
you
shoot
anybody?
He
shot
a
crack
head
with
a
Kalashnikov.
-
Where
did
you
get
that?
Where'd
he
get
that?
You
do
know
there
are
more
guns
Everybody
and
their
mums
-
Like
who?
-
Who
else?
What's
it
like
being
stabbed?
It
was
the
single
most
painful
What
was
the
second
most
painful?
You
ever
fired
two
guns
No.
You
ever
fired
one
gun
No.
-
Ever
been
in
a
high
speed
pursuit?
You
ever
fired
a
gun
No.

She's

you're
quite
the

Perhaps
you
might
like
to
join
us
Well,
I
haven't
held
a
firearm
I'd
quite
like
to
keep
it
that
way.
You
will
be
popular
with
the
local
birds.
Birds.
Nicholas,
hello.
Reverend
Shooter.
I
want
to
ask
you,
That
might
be
Oh,
you're
an
atheist?
No,
I'm...
I'm...
I'm
open
to
the
concept
of
religion,
-
You're
an
agnostic?
Robin
Hatcher,
our
resident
sawbones.
Hopefully
we
won't
see
too
much
Well,
all
that
remains
is
to
welcome
you
to
the

Now,
quick
announcement
before
we
begin.
Janet
Barker

given
birth
to
twins.
So,
congratulations
to
her.

Tom?
Now.
I
am
sure
that
all
of
you
will
have
noticed
It's
made
all
the
more
disturbing
as
I
refer,
of
course,

ANGEL:

as
it
is
about
fighting
crime.
Most
importantly,
in
the
execution
Any
questions?
Yes.
Is
it
true
that
there
is
a
place
that
if
you
shoot
it,
it
will
blow
up?

Hi,
hi,
Tim
Messenger.
Can
I
get
a
quick
shot
Okay.
How
about
you
put
the
teacher
I
don't
think
that

off
the
right
signals.
Too
cheesy-pie.
Okay.
Gotcha.
-
Give
the
little
blonde
kid
your
hat.
-
Wave
your

about.
Righty-ho-ho.

Kind

Well,
it's
a
swan.


That's
just
gonna
scare
it.
-
No
luck
catching
them
swans
then?
-
Want
anything
from
the
shop?
I
was
thinking
of
a
different
shop.
Constable
Butterman,
-
Well,
there's
nothing
going
on,
is
there?
You
have
to
look
closer,
all
right?
-
Mr
Treacher?
Why
has
he
got
that
big
coat
on?
He
can't
be
cold.
Why
the
extra
layer?
Mr
Treacher?
Okay.
What
about
this
guy?
Ask
yourself,
why
has
he
got
his
hat
-
He's
fuck
ugly.
Because
he's
fuck
ugly.
Okay,
what's
his

right.
All

their

Of
course.

your
gun
up
No,
I
have
not
ever
fired
my
gun
Thirty.
Sorry,
I...
I
just...
-
I
wanna
do
what
you
do.
What
on
earth
Gun
fights.
Car
chases.
Police
work
is
not
about
Twenty-nine.
If
you
had
paid
attention
to
me
in
school,
you'd
understand
that
it's
not
all
about
Fire
up
the
roof.
That
was
brilliant.
Was
I
going
a
tad
fast,
Officer?
Yes,
you
were,
Mr
Blower.
Well,
now,
you
see,
to
William
Shakespeare's
Romeo
and
Juliet
I'm
playing
the
eponymous
hero,
you
see.
Romeo
not
Juliet.
-
What
are
you
writing?
I
might
need
to
refer
to
it
later.
Now,
Officer,
I
am
a
respected
solicitor
Just
stop
writing,
will
you?
Look,
I'm
merely
trying
to
explain
You're
playing
the
male
lead
Romeo
and
Juliet
You
think
this
is
sufficient
reason
-
Well,
I...
-
specifically
put
in
place
to
save
lives.
-
"Preposterous."
"Stop
writing."
Look,
you're
right,
I
apologise.
-
See
what
I
did
there?
No,
I
used
this.
This
is
the
most
important
piece
This
notebook
has
saved
my
skin
You
should
think
-
I
do
use
mine.
-
That's
just
extraordinary.
-
What
are
you
up
to
tonight?
Thought
you
might
wanna
do
something.
-
What
exactly
were
you
thinking?
I
don't
think
that's
a
good
idea.
Do
you?
You
two.
A
Mr
Blower
left
you
tickets
Said
it
was
by
way
of
an
apology.
-
Yeah?
Well,
we
can't
accept
gifts
from
somebody
Yeah.
Nicholas.
Glad
I
caught
you.
Wondered
if
you
wouldn't
mind
-
Yes,
sir,
of
course.
Yeah!
Hey,
come
on,
it
might
be
fun.
A
dateless
bargain
to
engrossing
death.
Here's
to
my
love.

Now.

Poison?
I'll
kiss
thy
lips.
Happily
some
poison
Bang!

Sergeant
Angel,
hi-hi.
It
was
very
enjoyable.
-
"Cop
Enjoys
Watching
Young
Lovers"?
"Local
Bobby
Gives
Thumbs
Up
That's
just
grossly
inappropriate.
You
will
try
and
spell
his
name
Absolute
tosh,
wasn't
it?
And
annoyingly,
the
understudies
Greg
over
there
was
an
extra
in
Straw
Dogs
and
Sheree
portrayed
a

Sergeant
Angel,
you
came?
So
thrilled
you
accepted
my
invitation.
Well,
our
Inspector
Yeah,
we
can't
accept
gifts
from
Jog
on.
Congratulations
to
you
and
to
Mrs
Blower.
Oh,
this
is
not
my
wife.
Eve
works
in
the
local
council,
Sergeant.
-
I
am
not.
I'm
sure
if
we
bashed
your
head
in,
all
sorts
Romeo,
Romeo,
a
pint
of
bitter
for
Romeo?
Thank
you
very
much
for
coming,
George.
A
pleasure,
my
liege.
-
Eve's
nice,
ain't
she?
She
was
in
my
year
at
school.
She
clearly
has
a
thing
for
older
men.
What,
with
Martin
Blower?
No
way!
We
just
sat
through
three
hours
their
kiss
was
Hey,
now
you
come
to
mention
it,
I
too
have
reason
to
believe
Really?
How
so?
Marcus
Carter's
big
brother
said
Oh,
Officers.
Again
let
me
extend
That's
quite
all
right,
Mr
Blower.
Drive
safe.

"Drive
safe."
Oh,
my
God.
You
know
that's
the
bloke
Yeah.
Hopefully,

Who
is
it?
We
haven't
got
long.
To
us.

Who
is
it?

Yeah?
...decaffeinated?
Little
Brian
Libby
found
them,
Oh,
he'll
be
having
nightmares
for
a
while.
Must
have
hit
the
sign
at
some
speed.
-
I've
had
my
top
off
in
this
lay-by.
Most
likely
lost
control,
So,
what
do
we
reckon?
Sergeant
Angel?
Well,
we
should
get
a
proper
cordon
off,
Close
down
the
road
whereupon
we
should
open
Very
good.
What
he
said.
-
What
happened,
Danny?
Nasty
way
to
go.
Constable,
official
vocab
guidelines
state
we
no
longer
refer
to
these
incidents
Right.
"For
never
was
there
a
story
of
more
woe.
-
Excuse
me?
Mr
Skinner,
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
know
the
identity
You
know
how
it
is.
News
travels
fast.
A
love
struck
Romeo
-
What
happened,
Danny?
Hey,
why
can't
we
say
"accident"
again?
Because
"accident"
implies
Put
a
sock
in
it,
town
mouse.
Yeah,
you
wanna
be
a
big
cop
in
I'm
just
saying,
Most
times
they
are.
Let's
just
wait
till
Doctor
Hatcher
before
you
go
jumping
the
Kalashnikov.
All
right,
in
the
meantime,
why
don't
you
Martin
Blower
represents
Did
you
want
us
to
go
through
Yeah,
or
put
a
call
into
Aaron
A.
Aaronson,
Please,
don't
be
childish.
At
least
consider
interviewing
the
widow.
Martin
Blower
was
clearly
having
Oh,
and
how
did
you
establish
that?
'Cause
we
sat
through
three
hours
and
the
kiss
was
All
right,
pipe
down,
big
one.
Here,
what
else
you
got,
-
Skid
marks.
There
were
no
skid
marks
at
the
scene.
Doesn't
it
seem
a
little
strange
that
and
not
think
to
apply
the
brakes?
If
there
were
no
skid
marks
it
follows
that
for
300
yards
both
driver
and
passenger
You
don't
have
to
be
a
detective
Yeah.
-
Are
you
causing
trouble?
Well,
a
spot
of
bother
up
at
Ellroy
Farm.
Old
Arthur
Webley's
been
clipping
-
Yes,
sir?
Yes,
sir.
-
Why
do
we
need
the
dog?

Right.
What
did
he
say?

-
What
did
he
say?
"He
only
chopped
it
down
"What's
Reaper
moaning
about?"
Right.
Look,
I
appreciate
your
position,
but
you
can't
go
around
chopping
down
"Yes,
I
suppose."
Thank
you.
All
right.
Mr
Webley,
He
does
for
this
one.
What
do
you
mean
by
"this
one"?
By
the
power
of
Grey
Skull.
Where
on
earth
did
you
get
these?
-
Found
them.
-
And
what
is
this?
Sea
mine.
Well,
Mr
Webley,
It's
a
wonder
nobody's
been
hurt
before.
No,
it's
just
a
lot
of
junk.

an

you

Yes,

what
can
I
get
you?
Pint
of
lager,
please,
Roy.
And
what
can
I
get
you
-
I
don't
really
wanna
get
drunk.
-
Okay,
I'll
have
one.
Mr
Porter,
what's
your
wine
selection?
Oh,
we
got
red
or
white.
-
I'll
have
a
pint
of
lager,
please.
-
Any
news
from
earlier?
Doctor
Hatcher
reported
no
misadventure
Now,
come
on,
Sergeant,
it's
not
your
job
Is
it?
-
No,
it
isn't.
-
You
don't
switch
off,
do
you?
-
Well,
you
are
always
thinking
away.
-
Don't
get
me
wrong.
I
think
it's
amazing.
I
mean,
Officer.
What
made
you
wanna
be
I
don't
remember
a
time
Apart
from
the
summer
of
1979
It
all
started
with
my
Uncle
Derek.
He
bought
me
a
police
pedal
car
I
rode
round
in
it
every
second
I
was
awake.
Arresting
kids
twice
my
size
I
got
beaten
up
a
lot
when
I
was
young
I
wanted
to
be
like
Uncle
Derek.
He
sounds
like
a
good
bloke.
Actually,
he
was
arrested
What
a
cunt.
Probably
bought
the
pedal
car
Needless
to
say
I
never
went
near
it
again.
But
I
never
forgot
that
I
felt
at
the
wheel
of
that
pedal
car.
I
had
to
prove
to
myself
and
righteous
It
was
from
that
moment,
-
Shame.
I
think
you
would've
made
a
great
muppet.
What
about
you?
What
made
you
I
don't
know.
Dad
does
it.
I
think
after
my
mum
died,
it's
what
-
Do
you
mind
if
I
ask
how
she
died?
I'm
sorry.
Never
mind.
Hey,
watch
this.

-
Jesus
Christ!
Ta-da!
Hey,
come
on,
silly
bollocks,
get
them
in.
-
777.
-
You
know
George
Merchant,
don't
you?
Yes,
we
were
just
discussing
the
accident.
I'd
come
to
know
Martin
Such
a
loss.
What
say
we
drink
to
their
demise?
Shouldn't
that
be
"drink
to
their
memories"?
Of
course.
Cheers.
I
must
go
to
the
little
boys'
room.
-
GEORGE:
I'm
all
right!
Oh,
he'll
be
in
bits
tomorrow.
I
think
somebody
needs
to
go
home.
-
I'm...
I'm
not
that
drunk,
sir.
What?
Hey,
we
did
get
a
little
drunk.
'Cause
he's...
He's
little
and
he's
drunk.
Oh,
good
grief.
It's
hardly
in
keeping
-
How
much
do
I
owe
you?
There
you
go.
-
And
there's
your
change.
Bye-bye.

I'm
all
right.
I
would
not
wanna
be
him
in
the
morning.
Well,
this
is
me.
Well,
I
shall
see
you
in
the
morning.
Unless
you
wanna
come
in
-
I
don't
drink
coffee.
No
caffeine
after
midday.
How
about
another
beer?
Oh,
dear.
-
When
did
you
move
in?
-
You
should
get
some
house
plants.
Yeah.
I've
been
tending
my
Peace
Lily
It
oxygenates
the
room,
Its
needs
are
simple.
Janine
used
to
say
I
love
my
Lily
-
Is
that
why
you
split
up?
-
'Cause
you
did
it
with
a
plant?
It
was
more
about
me
being
That's
good
though,
right?
Is
it
though?
I
did
miss
a
few
dinners.
-
Listen,
mate,
I...
-
I
just
wanna
be
good
at
what
I
do.
You've
just
gotta
learn
to
switch
off
That's
the
whole
problem,
Danny.
I
don't
think
I
know
how.
I
can
show
you
how.
By

Which
one
do
you
think
I'll
prefer?
No,

You
are

did
you

That

So,

do
we
reckon?
Angel?
Help
me.
Okay,

get

up,

then
we
get

in
Very
good.
What
he
said.
Sergeant
Angel,
hi-hi.
A
quick
word?
Mr

I'm

Nasty

Sandford's

Worked
at?
-
More
specifically?
Where
George
Merchant
secured
permission
to
build
his
dubious
mansion
So...
Maybe
they
were
all
accidents.

-
What
are
you
two
up
to?
Well,
look
sharp.
-
There's
been
reports
of
a
fire
in
the
station.
Happy
birthday
to
you
Happy
birthday
to
you
-
Danny,
why
didn't
you
say
something?
-
Hey,
where
are
you
going?

Hello,
Miss
Tiller.
I
was
wondering,
Of
course.
I
was
just
about
to
pop
off,
actually.
I
can
never
find
my
scissors.
-
Is
this
for
someone
special?
-
Are
you
going
somewhere,
Miss
Tiller?
And
why
the
move,
-
Well,
just
between
you
and
I...
-
You
know
that
fella
who
blew
up?
Well,
George
Merchant,
God
rest
him,
so
he
sends
round
his
legal
fella,
and
I
thought
I
might
take
them
up
on
it.
I
haven't
really
got
that
much
family
So
I
thought
I
might
take
them
up
Would
you
like
a
card
with
this?
No,
sorry,
you
were
talking
about
the
offer?
Well,
it
turns
out
that
Martin
Blower,
knew
where
the
new
bypass
road
is
going
because
he
was
knocking
off
Eve
Draper
and
then
that
reporter,
God
rest
him,
and
tells
me
this
land's
very
valuable.
Ten
times
what
George
Merchant
and
So,
with
them
having
passed
on,
to
some
folks
from
the
city
God
rest
the
lot
of
them,
Apparently,
they
want
to
build
Of
course,
Cousin
Sissy
won't
be
but
as
far
as
I'm
concerned,
Would
you
just
excuse
me,
Stop!
In
the
name
of
the
law!
Hang
about,
hang
about.
You're
saying
this
wasn't
an
accident?
Leslie
Tiller
was
fucking
murdered!
-
What,
just
like
Tim
Messenger?
-
And
George
Merchant?
-
And
Eve
Draper?
-
And
Martin
Blower?
-
Really?
Thank
you,
Danny.
Oh,
murder,
murder,
murder.
Thank
you,
Andy.
Come
on,
Sergeant,
you've
gotta
accept
What
are
you
suggesting?
That
Leslie
Tiller
tripped
Ben
Fletcher
fell
Yeah,
accidents
happen
all
the
time.
-
Because
I
was
there!
Why
were
you
there?
I
was
buying
Constable
Butterman
What
absolute
horseshit.
I
chased
a
suspect
from
the
scene.
Here,
maybe
it
was
our
old
friend,
Oh,
yeah,
he
was
a
prickly
customer,
Am
I
going
completely
mad?
Maybe
you
are.
Maybe
you
did
it.
Yeah,
seeing
as
how
you're
such
-
What
the...
Yes!
Sir.
Nicholas,
Nicholas,
Nicholas.
What
am
I
going
to
do
with
you?
-
Sir,
you
have
to
understand...
The
boys
here
aren't
used
The
"M"
word,
Nicholas.
There
hasn't
been
a
recorded
murder
But,
sir,
I'm
certain.
And
what's
more,
I
know
who
did
it.
Can
I
see
the
manager,
please?
Mr
Skinner
to
the
Manager's
office.
Sergeant
Angel.
Simon
Skinner,
I'm
arresting
you
Leslie
Tiller's
dead?
How?
She
tripped
and
fell
on
her
own
shears.

I'm
also
arresting
you
on
suspicion
of
of
George
Merchant
on
April
29th
and
of
Eve
Draper
-
Why
on
earth
would
I
do
that,
Sergeant?
My
suspicions
were
first
aroused
at
the
scene
of
the
Blower-Draper
death,
despite
the
fact
you
live
and
work
I
couldn't
help
but
recall
your
comments
When
you
not
only
indicated
but
also
inferred
might
make
her
privy
You
even
spoke
of
"bashing
her
head
in."
Perhaps
hoping
you
might
discover
You
were
already
suspicious
a
large
area
of
land
after
an
article
Tim
Messenger
You
see,
the
land
Merchant
was
buying
if
it
became
accessible
by
road,
a
retail
park.
Consumed
with
concern
for
your
business
and
potential
disloyalty
you
yourself
expressed
a
wish
to
behead.
You
killed
the
competition
in
cold
blood.
Staging
the
murders
as
accidents.
You
used
a
vehicle
removal
truck
and
incinerated
an
old
man
Covering
your
tracks
with
the
judicial
However,
there
was
a
loose
end.
Tim
Messenger.
Splattered
before
he
could
share
with
me
what
he
told
Leslie
Tiller
The
true
value
of
her
land.
Upon
discovering
she
was
about
you
brutally
murdered
her
And
made
good
your
escape
utilising
Very
entertaining.
But
I
rather
think

He
hasn't.
Why
would
I
kill
Leslie?
Oh,
but
I
am,
"Cousin
Sissy."
I'm
afraid
my
nickname
of
Sissy
My
teenage
years
studying
ballet
-
Yeah,
Sissy
Skinner.
Thank
you,
Andrews.
Now,
despite
my
comments
I
personally
relish
the
competition
Anything
to
energise
my
workforce.
And
anyway,
what
makes
you
think
Or
for
that
matter,
stage
a
car
crash?
It's
a
well
known
fact
that

isn't
it
true

the

Sergeant,
this
is
the

Many

I

Tina

Nevertheless,
you
could
have
utilised
These
accusations
unless
you
can
back
them
up
Well,
you've
got
me
there.
I'd
need
something
conclusive.
Something
that
placed
you
Perhaps
a
wound
you
sustained
on
This
very
evening.
Sergeant,
this
is
beginning
How
could
I
possibly
be
I'm
sure
the
store's
security
footage
Do
feel
free
to
spool
through.
I
can
handle
this,
Danny.
You
might
as
well
go
back
-
Did
you
really
get
me
that
plant?
But
it's
been
impounded
as
evidence.
Well,
I
mean,
Yeah.
Sergeant,
I
wanted
you
to
know
that
if
I
do
indeed
now
belonging
to
Leslie,
that
I
intend
to
turn
it
Mr
Skinner,
what
you
do
with
your
land

So
jog
on.
Michael,
will
you
escort
the
Sergeant
Yarp.
I
just
can't
believe
Leslie's
dead.
She
tripped
and
fell
on
her
own
shears.
Hey,
that
weren't
me.
Hey,
look.
Look,

You

What's
the

You
got

Get
us
back
to
the

now!

-
It's
more
than
one
person.
-
It's
more
than
one
killer.
Yeah,
well,
maybe
it
still
is.
You
know,
maybe
he's...
Maybe
he's
Nicholas,
you're
an
exceptional
officer.
-
Sir?
It
was
exactly
the
same
thing.
You've
come
from
a
city
and
it's
driven
you
round
the
bend.
Yes,
sir.
Do
yourself
a
favour.
Sleep
on
it.
And
if
you
still
feel
the
same
in
the
morning,
Hey.
Hey,
what's
happening?
Nothing,
nothing.

I
mean,
do
you
want

Hey,

Michael?
Are
you

Michael?
Is
everything
okay?
Yarp.
Sergeant
Angel's
been
taken
care
of?
Yarp.
He's
not
gonna
get
back
up
again?
Narp!
Good.
Proceed
to
the
castle.
Frank,
this
shit
just
got
real.
Skinner
just
sent
someone
to
kill
me,
Up
to
the...
To
the
castle,
I
think.
Okay?
It's
Nicholas,
by
the
way.
Oh,
my
God.
Danny.
Danny,
just
stay
here,
okay?

Tell
him
I
was
right.

I'm
gonna
bust
this

open.

No

No

quick
announcement
before
we

Janet

And

Now,
you'll
all
be
delighted
to
hear
that
the

discover
the
Sergeant

having
slipped
So,
with
the
dispatch
of
the

we
will

be
able
to
concentrate
Quite
right.
After
which,
nothing
will
stand

Oh,
I
beg
to
differ,
Mr
Weaver.
Well,
well,
well,
I
see
we
have
visitors.
Sergeant
Nicholas
Angel.
My,
he
is
tenacious,
isn't
he?
I'm
arresting
you
under
suspicion
Oh,
come,
come,
Sergeant.
You
should
be
ashamed.
-
Calling
yourself
a
community
that
cares.
It's
all
about
the
greater
good.
ALL:
The
greater
good.
How
can
this
be
for
the
greater
good?
ALL:
The
greater
good.
You
see,
as
much
as
I
enjoyed
the
truth
is
far
less
complex.
Blower's
fate
was
simply
the
result
ALL:
Quite
appalling.
You
murdered
him
for
that?

Well,
he
murdered
Bill

we
had
two
semi-professionals
Let's
not
forget
that
Greg
And
Sheree
played
a
cadaver
Yes,
I
know!
Martin
was
less
concerned
than
he
was
with
his
sordid
affair
And
so
Eve
deserved
to
die
too?
Well,
she
did
have
a
very
annoying
laugh.
ALL:
Annoying.
-
And,
and
George
Merchant?
ALL:
Awful.
We
begged
him
in
vain
more
in
keeping
And
what
about
Tim
Messenger?
Tim
Messenger's
tenure
as
editor
of
Our
once
great
paper
had
Not
to
mention
persistent
errors.
-
He
listed
her
age
as
55.
Fifty-three.
What,
what
about
Leslie
Tiller?
Her
horticultural
expertise
helped
Oh,
she
was
ever
so
good.
Cousin
Leslie
was
a
terrible
shame.
But
it
seemed
she
was
set
on
moving
away.
We
couldn't
have
her
sharing
Not
least
those
heathens
at
Buford
Abbey.
If
we
can't
have
her,
no
one
can.
How
can
this
be
for
the
greater
good?
-
ALL:
The
greater
good.
These
people
died
for
no
reason.
Oh,
I
wouldn't
say
that.
Hello,
Nicholas.
I
was
like
you
once.
I
believed
in
the
immutable
word
of
the
law.
That
is
until
the
night
Mrs
Butterman
You
see,
She
was
head
of
the
Women's
Institute,
When
they
started
she
worked
round
the
clock.
On
the
eve
of
the
adjudicator's
arrival,
Before
you
could
say,
"Gypsy
scum,"
thieving
kids
and
crusty
jugglers.
ALL:
Crusty
jugglers.
We
lost
the
title
and
Irene
lost
her
mind.
She
drove
her
Datsun
Cherry
From
that
moment
on,
And
whatever
the
cost,
Sir,
this
doesn't
make
any
sense.
The
adjudicators
arrive
tomorrow.
Are
you
saying
this
is
all
about
This
is
the
best
village,
Nicholas.
-
They're
happy,
contented.
Sergeant
Popwell
I'm
disappointed
Well,
I'm
happy
to
disappoint
you,
sir.
And
I'm
afraid
You
are
all
gonna
have
to
come
with
me.
No,
Nicholas,
I'm
afraid
it
is
you
who
is
going
to
have
to
come
with
us.
Danny,
no.
Back
off!
Back
off!
Or
I
swear
to
God,
and
accidentally
cut
off
his
own
head.
Come
on,
Nicholas.
I
mean
it!
Shit!
FRANK:

Thieving
kids.
Dog
muck.
Crusty
jugglers.
Crusty
jugglers.
Crusty
jugglers.
Crusty
jugglers.

What
are
you
doing?
-
This
is
murder!
I'm
not
talking
about
that,
-
What
others?
-
That's
not
true.
Dad
just
said
it
was
his
special

he...
I
thought
it
was
about

and
sending
them
on
their
way.
I
don't
know
nothing
about
no
skelingtons.

What
did
you
think
was
happening?
It's
Frank.
He's
appointed
himself
judge,

He's
not
Judge
Judy

executioner.

You've
gotta
help
me
take
him
down.
He's
my
dad.
Take
my
car.
Go
back
to
London.
I
can
come
back.
I
can
come
back,
of
the
Metropolitan
Police
Service
with
me.
They'll
make
it
disappear.
My
dad,
or
a
loony
London
police
officer.
But
it
won't
be
just
me,
will
it?
We
can
do
it
together.
Forget
it,
Nicholas.
It's
Sandford.
Is
that
everything?
Sir?
Sir?
Sir?
-
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you?
This
is
something
I
have
to
do
myself.
Another
beautiful
day
in
God's
country.
Danny?
It's...
Mum!
What
you
gonna
do?
Just
walk
in
and
arrest
the
whole
village?
Not
exactly.
Oh,
Sergeant
Angel?
I'll
tell
them
you'll
ring
them
back.
-
Well,
that's
funny.
I
didn't
know
we
had
a
mounted
division.
Nobody
tells
me
nothing.
Wanna
do
something
useful?
AMANDA:
Annette,
that
Sergeant
Angel's
ANNETTE:

Roger
that!

It's...

Morning.



That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
Still
feel
like
you're
missing
out?

Fascist!
Hag!

Stop!
Stop
this,
please!
Let
us
stop
this
mindless
violence.
Nicholas,
my
son.
You
may
not
be
a
man
of
God,
I
may
not
be
a
man
of
God,
Reverend,
and
I
have
the
good
grace
Oh,
fuck
off,
Grasshopper.
No!
Jesus
Christ!
Nicholas!
Nicholas!

I
thought
you
was
a
goner.
Drop
your
weapons!
-
Dr.
Hatcher,
no!
I
brought
you
into
this
world,
I
should
be
the
one
to
take
you
out
of
it.
You
and
your
interfering
little
friend.
Now...
drop
them.

-
You're
a
doctor,
deal
with
it.
-
Danny,
let's
roll.
Pub?
Roy!
Somebody
call
the
police!
Freeze!
Officers,
arrest
that
man.
-
Danny,
step
away
from
the
Sergeant.
Danny,
you'll
do
as
you're
told.
I'm
not
taking
orders
from
you
anymore.
-
Officers,
arrest
these
men!
You
can
arrest
us
if
you
like.
You
can
throw
us
in
prison
and
go
back
Or
you
can
be
real
police
officers,
and
help
us
bring
an
end
What
the
fuck
is
he
on
about?
Fuck
are
you
on
about?
Have
you
ever
wondered
-
And
yet
the
accident
rate,
it's
so
high?
You've
been
brainwashed,
Tony.
Brainwashed
into
naivety
by
an
old
man
-
This
is
ridiculous.
And
it's
only
now
that
I'm
starting
to
realise
Silence,
Danny!
-
Think
of
your
mother.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
If
she
could
see
what
you've
become,
I
think
she'd
probably
kill
herself
Sorry,
I
am
completely
lost.
Sandford
is
a
lie,
Doris.
For
the
last
20
years,
the
village
They've
lulled
everyone
and
killed
anyone
I
reckon
he's
got
something
there.
He
says,
I
know.
You're
not
seriously
gonna
Are
you?
He
isn't
even
from
round
here.
Maybe
it's
time
to
give
it
up,
sir.
You
incompetent
flatfoots!
Officer
Walker,
stay
here
with
Saxon
Fair
enough.
Officers,
let's
go.
-
What
about
Dad?
Want
anything
from
the
shop?

-
What
you
thinking?
We
should
strike
now,
Longer
we
wait,
I
say
we
go
in
through
the
front
entrance,
They
won't
be
expecting
that.
Very
good.
What
he
said.
My,
my.
Here
come
the
fuzz.
-
Maybe
they're
not
here.
-
Don't
go
in
on
your
own.
Okay.
They're
in.
You
deal
with
the
store.

No,
listen.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
Michael,
Is
this
what
you
really,
really
want?
Yarp.
Suit
yourself.
FISHER:
Go,
go,
go.
Oh,
come
on.

Andy!
It's
all
right,
Andy.
It's
just
Bolognese!

-
How's
Lurch?
-
Did
you
say,
"Cool
off"?
Shame.
There
was
a
bit
earlier
on
that
you
missed
when
I
distracted
him
And
then
I
said,
"Playtime's
over,"
You're
off
the
fucking
chain!
-
What's
the
situation?
What
do
you
reckon?
Idea.

Good
work,
everyone.


-
Nice
one,
Doris.
Fruit
attack!
Can
you
handle
this,
Sergeant
Fisher?
We're
on
it,
Sergeant.
-
Danny,
let's
rock.
Don't
go
being
a
twat
now.
I
wouldn't
give
you
the
satisfaction.
-
We
should
get
down
there.
Skip.
-
Head
them
off?
-
I'll
drive.

Bang!
Bang!
Swan!
Swan!

Stay
back!
Or
the
ginger
nut
gets
it!

You
little
fucker!

Get
out
of
my
village!
It's
not
your
village
anymore.
-
You
did
good,
kid.
-
What's
your
name?
Sorry?
Angel!
It's
over,
Danny.
It's
over.

This
really
hurts.
I'm
going
to
need
some
ice-cream.
Yeah,
well,
don't
worry.
Isn't
that
right,
Danny?

Stay
back!
-
Pack
it
in,
Frank,
you
silly
bastard!
We
don't
want
any
more
bloodshed.
Frank,
this
whole
thing
started
Don't
expect
me
to
believe
I'll
tell
you
how
this
is
gonna
end!

I
feel
like
I
should
say
something
smart.
You
don't
have
to
say
anything
at
all.

Satisfactory
conclusion
Now,
my
perfect
Sunday
would
begin
with...

CHIEF
INSPECTOR:
We...
We...
-
Yeah,
well,
I've
been
kind
of
busy.
The
figures
have
gone
a
little
squiffy
Come
back
to
London.
Sandford's
hardly
a
fitting
place
Yeah,
well,
the
thing
is,
sir.
I
kind
of
like
it
here.
Besides,
we
have
to
do

-
Fuck's
sake,
Nick,
this
is
gonna
take
ages.
FISHER:
Well,
good
job
Well,
official
vocab
guidelines
state
'cause
"manpower's"
a
bit
sexist.

You
don't
mind
a
bit
Oh,
dirty
bastard!
Andy!
You
cheeky
fucker!
You
know
what
you
are?
A
bloody
busybody!
No!


Oh,
God,
no!
ANGEL:
Danny!
Danny!
Oh,
God.
Hold
on,
Danny,
just
hold
on.
Hold
on,
it's
gonna
be
fine.
Just
hang
on,
hang
on!
Everything's
gonna
be
fine.
Everything's
gonna
be
fine.
Everything's
gonna
be
fine.
Everything's
gonna
be
just
fine.
Hope
these
are
okay.
Yeah.
They're
lovely.
-
Any
officers
near
the
church?
Chief,
we've
had
a
report
messing
with
the
recycling
bins
-
Leave
it
with
us.
Sergeant
Butterman,
Bring
the
noise.
