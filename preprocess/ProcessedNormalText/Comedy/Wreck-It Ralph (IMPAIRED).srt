My
name's
Ralph,
and
I'm
a
bad
guy.
Let's
see.
I'm
nine
feet
tall.
Got
a
little
bit
of
a
temper
on
me.

RALPH:
My
passion
bubbles
I
guess,
not
gonna
lie.
Anyhoo,
what
else?
Uh...
I'm
a
wrecker.
I
wreck
things.
I'm
very
good
at
what
I
do.

The
thing
is,
fixing

NICELANDERS:

RALPH:
So,
yeah,
naturally,
the
guy
with
the
name
He's
nice
enough
as
good
guys
go.
Definitely
fixes
stuff
really
well.
But,
uh,
if
you've
got
a
magic
hammer
how
hard
can
it
be?
If
he
was
a
regular
contractor
I
guarantee
you
would
not
be
able
to
fix
the
damage
that
I
do
as
quickly.
And
when
Felix
does
But
are
there
medals
for
To
that
I
say,
"Ha!"

And,
no,
there
aren't.

Thirty
years
I've
been
doing
this
and
I've
seen
a
lot
of
Kind
of
sad.
I
think
about
Boom!
Gone.
Centipede?
Who
knows
where
Look,
a
steady
arcade
gig
I'm
very
lucky.
It's
just,
I
got
to
say,
it
becomes
kind
of
hard
to
love
your
job
when
no
one
seems
to
All
clear!
The
arcade
is
closed!
Shoryuken!
Whoo!
What
a

You

If
you're
buying,
buddy.
FELIX:
Quitting
time!
RALPH:
I
don't
know.
Maybe
I
wouldn't
be
feeling
this
way
if
things
were
different
after
work.
But
it
is
what
it
is.
Good
job,
everyone!
RALPH:
Felix
and
the
Nicelanders
go
hang
out
in
their
homes
which
he's
just
fixed,
They
go
to
their
homes,
I
go
to
mine
which
happens
to
be
a
dump.
And
when
I
say
"a
dump,"
I
don't
mean
like
a
shabby
place.
I
mean
an
actual
dump,
where
the
garbage
goes
and
a
bunch
of
bricks
That's
what
I
call
home.
I
guess
I
can't
bellyache
too
much.
I
got
my
bricks,
I
got
my
stump.
It
looks
uncomfortable.
But
if
I'm
really
honest
with
myself...
I
see
Felix
up
there
people
are
giving
him
pie
and
so
happy
to
see
him
all
the
time.
Sometimes
I
think...
Man,
it
sure
must
be
nice

CLYDE:
Nice
share,
Ralph.
As
fellow
bad
guys,
we've
all
felt
what
you're
feeling
and
we've
come
to
terms
with
it.
-
Really?
I
am
Zangief.
I
am
bad
guy.
ALL:
-
Hi,
Zangief!
I
relate
to
you,
Ralph.
I
was
crushing
man's
skull
like
sparrow
egg
between
my
thighs.

And
I
think,
"Why
do
you
have
"Why
can't
you
be
more
like
good
guy?"
Then
I
have
moment
of
clarity.
If
Zangief
is
good
guy.
Who'll
crush
man's
skull
like
sparrow's
egg
between
thighs?
And
I
say,
"Zangief,
you
are
bad
guy,
but
this
does
not
mean

Right.
I'm
sorry.
You
lost
me
there.
-
Zombie!
Bad
guy!
Hi,
Zombie.
Zangief
saying
Good!
Bad!

You
must
love
you.
-
Yeah!
Inside
here!
Okay.
All
right,
I
get
you.
Question,
Ralph.
We've
been
asking
you
and
tonight
you
finally
show
up.
-
Why
is
that?
I
just
felt
like
coming.
I
suppose
it
has
Well,
today
is
the
30th
Well,
happy
anniversary,
Ralph.
Thanks,
Satan.
Uh,
it's
Sateen,
actually.
Got
it.
But
here's
the
thing.

I
don't
want
to
be
the
bad
guy
any
more.

You
can't
mess
with
You're
not
going
Turbo,
are
you?
Turbo?
No,
I'm
not
going
Turbo!
Is
it
Turbo
to
want
a
friend?
Or
a
piece
of
pie
every
once
in
a
while?
Is
it
Turbo
to
want
more
out
of
life?
Yes!
Ralph,
Ralph,
we
get
it.
But
we
can't
change
who
we
are.
And
the
sooner
you
accept
that,
the
better
off
your
game
Hey.
One
game
at
a
time,
Ralph.
Let's
close
out
with
ALL:
I'm
bad,
and
that's
good.
I
will
never
be
good,
and
that's
not
bad.

rather
be

Just
a

Felix.
They're
bringing

Hey,

Cake?
Heard
about
this

stuff.
Never
had
it.
No

ever
seems
to
throw
it
out
so
it
never
ends
up
in
the

I
never
actually
tasted
it.
Uh...
I've
always
wanted
to
try
cake.
I
don't
suppose
you'd
like
to
come
in

have

would

Hey-o,

He's

of

And
I'm
a
big
part
of
the

speaking.

See

Look
at

No,
no.
You
see,

for
you
up

What
about

We
could
take

Easy.

How
about

just
eat

Hang

Felix
needs

wanted

that?
Didn't
hear
you.
Your
breath
is
so
bad
Listen,
I
tried
to
be
nice.

I
tried
to
be
nice.
-
You're
mimicking
me.
-
Okay.
That
is
rude,
And
this
conversation
is
over.
Uh,
I
wouldn't
grab
that
branch
I'm
from
the
candy
tree
department,
It's
a
double
stripe.

Double
stripes
break.
Guh-doy!
Why
are
your
hands
so
freakishly
big?
Uh,
I
don't
know.
Why
are
you
Why
are
you
so
freakishly...
Sweet
mother
of
monkey
milk!
Don't
even
think
about
it.
That
is
mine.
-
Race
you
for
it!
I
don't
have
to
race
for
it
-
Double
stripe!
-
The
winner!
Whoa!
Double
stripe.

Thank
you!
Wait!
Let
me
talk
to
you
for
one
second.
Okay.
Here's
the
thing.
I'm
not
from
the
candy
tree
department.
Lying
to
a
child.
Shame
on
you,
Ralph.
But
I
wasn't
lying
about
the
medal.
That's
why
I
was
climbing
the
tree.
It's
precious
to
me.
That
thing
is
my
ticket
to
a
better
life.
Yeah,
well,
now
it's
my
ticket.
-
What
the...
Come
back!
I'll
find
you!
I
will
find
you!
Double
stripe!

Nowhere
to
hide!
Yeah,
he
banged
around
in
here
then
he
went
barreling
down
like
a
crazy
person.
"Sugar
Rush."
Cy-Bugs
would
chew
up
that
game
faster
than
a
chicken
hawk
-
What
was
that,
now?
There
was
a
Cy-Bug
on
that
shuttle!
Do
you
even
know
what
a
Cy-Bug
is?
I
can't
say
that
I
do,
ma'am.
Cy-Bugs
are
like
a
virus.
They
don't
know
they're
in
a
game.
All
they
know
is
eat,
kill,
multiply.
Without
a
beacon
to
stop
them,
they'll
consume
Sugar
Rush.
But
do
you
think
they'll
stop
there?
-
Yes!
Viruses
do
not
stop!
Once
those
Cy-Bugs
they'll
invade
every
other
game
is
nothing
but
a
smoking
husk
Kohut!
My
cruiser.
Jeepers.
Is
she
always
this
intense?
It's
not
her
fault.
She's
programmed
with
The
one
day
she
didn't
do
Her
wedding
day.


Wait,
ma'am!
I'm
going
with
you.
Like
fun
you
are,
short
stack.
If
you
die
outside
your
game,
Well,
neither
do
you,
ma'am.
And
it
is
my
job
to
fix
And
I
cannot
ask
you
to
risk
your
life
cleaning
up
his
mess.
No
flex
on
this
one,
ma'am.





SOUR
BILL:
Citizens
of
Sugar
Rush...
Just
in
time.
...all
hail
our
rightful
ruler,
King
Candy.
Hello,
my
royal
subjects!
Ha-ha!
Have
some
candy!

Thank
you
for
that
Mmm-hmm.
And
thank
you
to
today's
avatars.
It
was
a
wonderful
day
of
racing.
It
was.
But
now
the
arcade
is
closed,
so
it's
time
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
and
race
to
decide
our
new
roster.
The
first
nine
racers
will
represent
Sugar
Rush
ALL:

Race!
Race!
Race!
KING
CANDY:
Okay,
calm
down.
Listen!
This
event
is
pay-to-play.
The
fee
to
compete
is
one
gold
coin
from
your
previous
winnings,
if
you've
ever
won,
which
I
have.
Let
me
go
first!
ANNOUNCER:

the
race!
Vanellope?

The
Glitch!

KING
CANDY:
Now,
now!

Everything
is
all
right!
Security!
Come
here,
kid!
We're
not
going
to
hurt
you,

Get
back
here!
Slow
down!
Slow
down
a
little
bit.

You!
Give
me
back
my
medal
right
now!
-
Ah,
boy!
What
is
that?
WYNNCHEL:
Come
on!
Go!
Roll!


Careful!
What
are
you
doing?
Huh?

Come

here!
I
can't

Now

Oh,

She
went
that
way!

Hold
still!
Ow!
What
are
you
doing?
Okay,
folks.

Calm
down!
Everything's
all
right.
The
monster's
been
caught!
We'll
repair
all
the
damage.
Don't
worry.
We
will
have
our
race
And
I'm
in
it.
Yes!
There's
no
way
that
Rancis,
Candlehead,
come
on.
Sour
Bill,
that
glitch
And
bring
that
thing
to
my
castle.
Guys!
She
took...


Or-e-oh
Or-e-oh



Sour
Bill,
de-taffify
this
monster
so
we
can
see
Mm-kay.

Milk
my
duds!
It's
Wreck-It
Ralph?
Yeah.
Who
are
you,

Please.
No.
I'm
King
Candy!
I
see
you're
a
fan
of
pink.
Salmon.
Salmon,
that's
obviously...
What
are
you
doing
here?
Look,
Your
Candiness,
Just
get
me
out
of
this
cupcake,
I'll
get
my
medal,
Your
medal?

Well,
this
one
did.
I
earned
it
over
in
Hero's
Duty.
You
game-jumped?
Ralph,
you're
not
going
Turbo,
are
you?
What?
No,
no.
Because
if
you
think
you
can
and
take
over
my
game,
Easy,
Your
Puffiness.
It's
not
my
fault
one
of
your
children
of
the
candy
corn
stole
my
medal.
"Children
of
the
candy
corn"?
Who'd...
The
Glitch!
The
coin
she
used
to
That
was
your
medal?
She
did
what?
I
need
that
back!
Well,
I'm
afraid
I
can't
help
you.
It's
nothing
but
code
now.
It
will
stay
that
way
at
the
end
of
the
race.
Maybe
I'll
have
to
have
a
little
talk
with
the
winner
then.
Is
that
a
threat
I
smell?
Beyond
the
halitosis
Listen,
Nilly-Wafer,
Yes,
you
are.
Wynnchel,
Duncan,
and
on
the
first
train
back
home.
If
I
ever
see
you
here
again,
I'll
lock
you
in
my
fungeon.
Fungeon?
Fun
dungeon,
you
know?

It's
the...
Never
mind!
I've
got
a
glitch
Goodbye,
Wreck-it
Ralph!
This
thing
is
hard
as
a
rock.
I
can
see
that.
-
Get
the
tools.
-
Quiet,
you!
What?
No!
-
Take
it
easy,
big
boy!
He's
getting
away!
Quick!
Call
out
the
Devil
Dogs.



Chocolate.
I
hate
chocolate!
I
got
to
get
my
medal
back.
The
pot
goes
to
the
winning
racer!
Hey,
kids!

Hello,
fellow
racers!
It's
that
little
crumb
snatcher.
Candlehead,
Taffyta,
Rancis,
Came
by
to
check
out
Well,
here
it
is,
the
Lickety-Split!
Sheesh.
Looks
like
she
built
it
herself.
I
built
it
myself.
Fastest
pedal-power
Check
her
out.

Oh,
Vanellope,
it's
so...
You.

But
you
have
to
Oh,
no,
I
don't,
because
I
paid
my
fee
So,
yeah,
I'm
definitely
racing.
Yeah,
well,
King
Candy
says
I'm
not
a
glitch,
Taffyta.
The
rules
are
there
To
protect
us.
Say
I'm
you.
I'm
in
my
weird
little
car
and
I'm
driving
and
I
actually
feel
kind
of
cool
for
once.
And
then,
all
of
a
sudden,
oh,
no.
I'm

glitching!

-
Hey!
You're
an
accident
Oh,
no!
I

glitched,
too!
Uncool.
Stop
it!
Stop!
You're
breaking
it!
Please!
I
just
want
to
race
like
you
guys.
You
will
never
be
a
racer
And
that's
all
you'll
ever
be!
Hey!
Leave
her
alone!


Let's
get
out
of
here!
Scram,
you
rotten
little
cavities!
Before
I
throw
you
in
the
mud!
What
are
you
looking
at?
You're
welcome,
you
rotten
little
thief.
I'm
not
a
thief!
I
was
going
to
give
it
back
to
you
It's
not
a
coin.
It
is
a
medal.
Coin,
medal,
whatever.
Just
go
back
to
your
own
dumb
game
I
can't.
I
didn't
win
it
in
my
game.
I
won
it
in
Hero's
Duty.
Hero's
Doodie?

It's
not
that
kind
of
duty.
I
bet
you
really
got
to
watch
in
a
game
called
Hero's
Doodie!

What
did
you
win
the
medal
for,
wiping?
I
hope
you
washed
your
hands
-
Listen!
Why
did
the
hero
flush
the
toilet?
-
Say
"why."
Because
it
was
his
doodie!
How
dare
you
insult
Hero's
Duty?
You
little
guttersnipe!
I
earned
that
medal
and
you
better
get
it
back
Well,
unless
you've
got
a
go-cart
hidden
in
the
fat
folds
of
your
neck,
I
can't
help
you!

What
a
moron.
Hey,
genius!
It's
a
jawbreaker.
You're
never
going
to
break...
Huh.

Enjoy
your
little
tantrum,
diaper
baby?
Leave
me
alone.
Look,
you
want
that
medal,
So
here's
what
I'm
thinking.
You
help
me
get
a
new
cart...
And
I'll
win
the
race
You
want
me
to
help
you?
All
you
got
to
do
is
Come
on.
What
do
you
say,
friend?
We
are
not
friends.
Oh,
come
on,
pal.
You
son
of
a
gun.
Come
on,
buddy.
Let's
shake
on
it.
Ah.
Come
on,
chumbo.
Ralph,
my
man.
My
main
man.
Hey!
My
arm's
getting
tired.

You
better
win.
Well,
I'll
say
this
much,
they
don't
call
your
friend
There's
the
shuttle.
Is
he
in
there?
Nope.
Lucky
for
him.
Otherwise
I
would
have
No
Cy-Bug,
either.
Got
to
find
it
before
it
It
came
this
way,
but
the
sugar
particles
are
jamming
my
sensor.
Can't
get
a
read
on
it.
So
what
is
it
with
this
Wreck-It
joker?
Why
did
he
go
AWOL?
I
wish
I
knew,
ma'am.
He
was
acting
all
squirrelly
last
night...
Going
on
about
cake
and
medals...
But
I
never
thought
he'd
go
Turbo.
"Go
Turbo"?
That's
right,
Well,
back
when
the
arcade
Turbo
Time
was
by
far
-
And
Turbo...
-
He
loved
the
attention.
So,
when
RoadBlasters
got
plugged
in
and
stole
Turbo's
thunder...
New
game.
All
right!
Boy,
was
he
jealous.
So
jealous
that
and
tried
to
take
over
the
new
one.
PLAYER
1:
These
are
Turbo-tastic!
PLAYER
2:
Hey.
Is
that...
PLAYER
1:
What's
Turbo
doing
PLAYER
2:
Mr.
Litwak!
FELIX:
Turbo
ended
up
out
of
order,
for
good.
Yes,
the
selfish
man
chasing
a
cautionary
tale.
I
know,
right?
That's
why
I
have
to
get
Ralph
home
or
the
same
thing's



What
is
this?
-
"Nesquik
Sand"?
Oh,
I'll
hop
out

Huh!


I
can't
hop.
I'm
hop-less.
We're
going
to
drown
here.
Stop
thrashing.
Stop
moving.
You're
making
us
sink
faster.
We're
going
to
die!
Get
ahold
of
yourself!

FELIX:
The
vines.
They're
Laffy
Taffy.
They're
attracted
to
Here,
hit
me
again.

That's
not
funny
enough.
Harder!
Look,
you're
a
nice
guy.
I
can't...
No,
ma'am!
Now
do
your
duty.
That's
an
ord...
-
Oh!
It's
working!
Hit
me
again.
Ooh,
your
eye.
I
can
fix
it.
Now...
Oh!
San
Fran-tastic!
Again!
Ow!
You
mean
business!
Ow!
Yikes
on
bikes!
Wow!
We're...
killing...
them!
Comedy
gold!

All
right,
enough
with
the
goo-goo
eyes.
We've
got
work
to
do.
Let's
go.

Ugh.
We
lost
the
Cy-Bug.
Come
on.
We'll
get
You
think
you
can
fix
that
shuttle?
Can
do.

Shh!
All
right,
do
your
thing,
knuckles.
What's
this?
Hey,
we
shook
on
it.

Thank
you,
Jeeves.
What
is
this
place?
You
gotta
make
one.
What?
No,
no.
Look,
kid,
bad
idea.
Trust
me.
I
don't
make
things.
I
break
things.
Well,
it
looks
like
your
comfort
zone,
then,
Gladys.
Ooh,
this
is
a
good
one!
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome

RALPH:
What

this,
another

VANELLOPE:
Yeah,
well,
You

one
minute
to
win
it.

What?
Go!
Mixing.
Put

Hairbrush.
No!
Underpants.
No,

You're

I'm

I'll

I'm

Yeah,
no

VANELLOPE:
Okay,

No

Oh.
ANNOUNCER:
Time's
up!
You
did
it,
and
here's
your
can!

Look,
kid...
I
tried
to
warn
you.
I
can't
make
things.
I
just
break...
I
love
it.
You
do?
I
love
it.
I
love

I

I

Look,
it's
got

And
look
at
these
wheels.

I
love
it!
I
finally
have
a
real
cart!
Come
on.
A
work
of
art

Cream
puffs.

Hmm?


This
is
Beard
Papa.
The
Glitch
is
in
the
bakery!
Oh,
what?
You
have
teeth?
I
don't
think
I've
ever
I'm
not
smiling.
I
was...
I'm
gassy,
okay?

Hold
it
right
there,
Glitch!

-
And
Wreck-It
Ralph?

Start
the
cart!
Start
the
cart!
What
are
you
waiting
for?
I
don't
know
how
to
drive
a
real
cart.
You
don't

Are
you
hurt,
Sire?
No,
he
just
glazed
me.
Get

Ah!
Stop,

Get

Head

Are
you
crazy?

Oh!
Where
did
they
go?
Find
that
glitch!
Destroy
that
cart!
She
can't
be
allowed
to
race!
So
let
me
get
this
straight.
Well,
no,
not
technically.
-
I
just
thought
that...
"Oh,
I'll
just
magically
win
the
race
just
because
I
really
want
to!"
Look,
wise
guy.
I
know
I'm
a
racer.
I
can
feel
it
in
my
code.

That's
it!
I'm
never
What
is
the
big
whoop
about
The
big
whoop?
Well,
this
may
come
as
I'm
the
bad
guy
-
Cool.
Unhygienic
and
lonely
and
boring.
And
that
crummy
medal
I
go
home
with
that
baby
and
I'll
get
a
penthouse.
Pies.
Ice
sculptures.
Fireworks!

It's
grown-up
stuff.
No,
I
get
it!
That's
exactly
-
Well,
guess
what?
News
flash!
Neither
one
of
us

What
was
that?

Yeah!
Check
it
out.
Look!
Oh!
Ow!
Whoa!
You
got
to
watch
out
for
the
splash.
That
stuff
is
broiling
hot.
RALPH:
Yeah,
I
got
that.
Thank
you.
What
is
this
dump?
I
think
it's
some
sort
of
Yeah.
It's
pretty
cool,

I

Oh,
look,

look.
Welcome
to

I

in
these
candy
wrappers.
I

With
all
this
garbage
around
you?
Well,
yeah.
I
mean,
everyone
here
and
that

wasn't
What
do
you
expect?
Listen,
kid...
I
know
it's
none
of
m
business
but
why
do
you
even
You
really
don't
know
anything,
do
you?
Glitches
can't
leave
their
games.
It's
one
of
the
joys
of
being
me.
Hey,
what
are
you
doing?
Come
on!
I
know
it's
a
dump,
but
it's
all
I
got.
If
you're
going
to
be
a
racer,
you're
going
to

Whoa!
All
right,
now.
Let's
hustle
up.
I'm
going
to
learn
to
drive!
Oh,
wait.
Do
you
know
how
to
drive?
Yeah!
I
mean,
I
haven't
done
it,
but...
Look,
I
flew
a
spaceship
today,
okay?
You
crashed
it.
Just
get
in.
How
hard
can
it
be?
Start
it
up.

There
we
go.
So
there
are
-
Pedals.
Now,
uh,
that's
the
go
pedal.
That
I
believe
is
the
stopper.
And
this...
Wait.
What
is
this?
That
doesn't
do
anything.
Ooh,
what
does
this
joystick
do?
Okay,
good.
Let's
try
that
again.
I've
been
looking
So
if
you
think
that
you're
the
one
Ow!
To
step
into
my
ride
I'm
a
fine-tuned
supersonic
Ow!
With
a
sunroof
top
and
a
gangster
lean
Ow!
So
if
you
feel
me
Ow!
So
start
me
up
Get
you
where
you
wanna
go
Got
a
ride
that's
smoother
'Cause
I'm
0
to
60
in
three
point
five
Now
shift
it.
Baby
you
got
the
keys
That's
good.
Keep
going!
Shift
it
again!
Now
shut
up
and
drive

I
told
you,
racing's
in
my
code!
So
if
you
feel
me

I
got
that
medal
in
the
bag!
Hey,
Ralphie,
watch
this!
Get
you
where
you
wanna
go
Got
a
ride
that's
smoother
Whoo-hoo!
Cause
I'm
zero
to
60
in
three
point
five
Baby
you
got
the
keys
-
Look
out!
Shut
up
and
drive
Ah!
Hot
cola!
Now
shut
up
and
drive
So
how
did
I
do?
Um...
Well,
you
almost
blew
up
Right,
right.
That's
a
good
note.
You
got
to
get
that
Okay,
I
will,
I
will.
And
then
you
think
I
got
a
chance?
Um...
Tiny.
Yes,
I'm
going
to
win!
I'm
going
to
win!
I'm
going
to
win!
-
Top
shelf.

Did
you
find
her?
You
didn't?

Go.
Leave
me.

Up,
up,
down,
down...

Start!
Oh,
the
code.
It's
the
sweet
Where
are
you?
Let's
see...
Ha-ha!
There
it
is.
The
winner's
cup.
One
of
these
things
is
We're
going
to
give
you
Success!

Sour
Bill,
I'm
going
out.
You're
in
charge
of
the
castle
Your
face
is
still
red.
You
might
want
to
Oh,
that's
not
blunt
force
trauma,
ma'am.
That's
just
the
honey
glow
Okay.
Ma'am,
I
just
got
to
tell
you...
You
are
one
dynamite
gal.
Wow,
you
are
one
dynamite
gal.
One
dynamite
gal.
Dynamite
gal.
Dynamite...

Get
out.
All
I
said
is
you're
a
dynamite
gal.
I
said
get
out!
Oh.
Jiminey
jaminey.
Yes?
Oh.
I'm
Fix-It
Felix
Jr.,
sir,
Have
you
seen
my
friend
Ralph?
Wreck-It
Ralph?
Yes.
Yes,
that's
him!
We
should
have
locked
him
up
Locked
him
up?
I'm
not
making

VANELLOPE:
Hurry,
hurry!
Come
on,
Ralph!
This
is
it.
This
is
really
happening.
I
almost
don't
believe
it.
I
mean,
I
have
dreamt
about
it
And
now...
Now
I
think
I
mean,
I
think
I
might
puke.
-
You
know,
like
a
"vurp."
Vomit
and
a
burp
together,
and
you
can
taste
it,
Oh,
this
is
so
exciting!
Yes,
it
is.
It's
exciting.
Am
I
ready
to
be
a
real
racer?
Ralph,
what
if
the
gamers
don't
like
me?
Who
doesn't
love
a
brat
Those
people
are
going
-
Because
you're
a
winner.
-
And
you're
adorable!
And
everyone
loves
Yeah!
Okay,
come
on.
Listen
to
me.
If
you
get
nervous,
"I
must
win
Ralph's
medal
-
And
have
fun.
Got
it?
Whoa!
Oh,
wait!

Hold
on!
Where
are
you
going?
I
forgot
something!
I'll
be
right
back!

Kids.

Ralph!

-
You!
I've
had
enough
of
you,
pillow
pants!
Please.
Calm
down!
Please,
look.
Don't!

I'm
going
to
beat
the
filling
out
of
you!
You
wouldn't
hit
a
guy
You
hit
a
guy
with
glasses.

Listen,
I
just
want
to
talk
to
you.
I'm
not
interested
in
How
about
this?
My
medal.
How
did
you...
It
doesn't
matter.

Whoa.
All
I
ask
is
that
you
hear
me
out.
About
what?
Ralph,
do
you
know
about
being
a
king
is?
Doing
what's
right,
no
matter
what.
Get
to
the
point.
Point
being,
I
need
your
help.
Sad
as
it
is,
Vanellope
Why
are
you
people
so
against
her?
I'm
not
against
her!
If
Vanellope
wins
that
race
she'll
be
added
to
the
race
roster.
Then
gamers
can
choose
her
And
when
they
see
her
glitching
and
twitching
and
just
being
herself,
they'll
think
our
game
is
broken.
We'll
be
put
out
of
order
for
good.
All
my
subjects
will
be
homeless.

But
there's
one
who
cannot
Help!
Somebody,
help!
Help!
KING
CANDY:
And
when

No!
...she'll
die
with
it.
You
don't
know
that
will
happen.
The
gamers
could
love
her.
And
if
they
don't?
I
know
it's
tough,
but
heroes
have
to
make
She
can't
race,
Ralph,
So
can
I
count
on
you
to
Very
good.
I'll
give
you
two
some
time
alone.

I'm
back!
Did
you
miss
me?
Yeah...
Uh...
Can
we
talk
for
a
second?
Wait.
First,
kneel
down.
-
What?
No,
we
really...
Okay.
-
Now,
close
your
eyes.
Shush!
Close
them!

Okay.
Open
them
up.
"To
Stinkbrain."
Gee,
thanks.
Turn
it
over.
I
made
it
for
you.
Just
in
case
we
don't
win.
Not
that
I
think
we're
not
going
to
win.
Thanks,
kid.
Listen...
Now
rise,
my
royal
chump.
Ralph,
come
on.
Move
your
molasses.
Um...
-
I've
been
thinking.
Who
cares
about

That's
not
very
funny,
Ralph.
No,
I'm
serious,
and
it
was
really
fun
to
build
the
car
and
everything...
But
maybe
you
shouldn't
do
it.
Hello?
Is
Ralph
in
there?
I'd
like
to
speak
to
him,
please.
Look,
what
I'm
saying
is
What?
Why
would
you...
Wait
a
minute.
No!
Where
did
you
get
this?
Look,
I'm
going
to
be
I've
been
talking
to
King
Candy.
-
King
Candy?
You
sold
me
out?
No,
I
didn't...
Listen.
No,
I
understand
plenty.
Traitor!
I'm
not
a
traitor.
Listen.
You're
a
rat!
And
I
don't
need
you,
and
But
I'm
trying
to
save
your
skin,
kid!
Put
me
down!
Let
me
go!
No,
you
listen
to
me.
Do
you
know
what's
going
to
happen
when
the
players
see
you
glitching?
They'll
think
the
game's
broken.
I
don't
care!
You're
a
liar!
You
better
care,
because
you
go
down
with
the
ship,
little
sister!
I'm
not
listening
to
you!
Get
out
of
my
way!
No,
you're
not!

Take
me
down
from
here,
Ralph,
No.
I'm
doing
this
for
your
own
good!
Wait,
wait,
wait.
No.
No.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
Please,
Ralph!

Stop
it!
Stop
it!
No!


You
really
are
a
bad
guy.

Hello?
Anybody
home?
Felix?
Mary?
Well,
you
actually
went
and
did
it.
Gene.
Where
is
everybody?
They're
gone.
After
Felix
went
to
find
you
Everyone
panicked
But
I'm
here
now.
It's
too
late,
Ralph.
Litwak's
pulling
our
plug
in
the
morning.
Oh!
But
never
let
it
be
said
The
place
is
yours,
Ralph.
Enjoy.
Gene,
wait!
Wait!
Listen,
this
is
not
what
I
wanted!
Well,
what
did
you
want,
Ralph?
I
don't
know.
I
just...

I
was
just
tired
of
Well,
now
you
can
live
alone




Hey,
cough
drop.
Explain
something
to
me.
If
Vanellope
was
never
meant
to
exist,
then
why
is
her
picture
on
Uh...

What's
going
on
in
this
candy-coated
heart
of
darkness?
Nothing.
-
Talk!
-
I'll
lick
you.
Oh,
yeah?
Oh!
That's
like
sandpaper!
Mmm.
Wonder
how
many
to
get
to
your
center.
I'll
take
it
to
my
grave!
Fair
enough.
Oh!

They
call
you
-
Had
enough
yet?
Vanellope
was
a
racer
until
King
Candy
RALPH:
Tried
to
delete
her
code?
So
that's
why
she's
a
glitch!
I
don't
know!
Suit
yourself.
No,
no,
no!
I
swear
I
don't
know!
He
literally
locked
up
our
memories
and
I
cannot
remember!
Nobody
can!
But
I
do
know
this.
He'll
do
anything
Because
if
she
crosses
the
finish
line,
the
game
will
reset
and
Where
is
she
now?
In
the
fungeon
with
Fix-It
Felix.
Felix?
I'm
sorry!
That's
all
I
know,
I
swear!
Now,
please,
don't
put
me
back
Stick
around.
Yes,
okay,
I
will.
I
will.
Thank
you!
Come
on.
I
know
you're
out
there.

Saccharine-saturated
nightmare!


But...
Where?


Doomsday
and
Armageddon
Hello?
Hello?
Somebody!
Anybody!
Please
let
me
out!
What's
he
say?


Why
do
I
fix
everything
I
touch?
Oh!

Barn!
-
Felix!
I'm
so
glad
to
see
you!
Wait.
No,
I'm
not.
What
do
Wait!
I
don't
want
to
hear
it.
Okay,
don't
talk.
That's
fine.
But
you
have
to
fix
I
don't
have
to
do
boo!
I'm
just
so,
so
cross
with
you!
Do
you
have
any
idea
I
ran
higgledy-piggledy
I
almost
drowned
in
chocolate
milk-mix!
And
then...
I
met
the
most
dynamite
gal.
Oh!
She
gives
me
the
honey
glow
But
she
rebuffed
my
affections.
And
then
I
got
thrown
in
jail!
Felix,
pull
yourself
together.
No!
You
don't
know
and
treated
like
a
criminal!
Yes,
I
do.
That's
every
day
of
my
life.
It
is?
Which
is
why
I
ran
off
I'm
just
a
bad
guy,
and
I
need
your
help.
There's
a
little
girl
Please,
Felix,
fix
it.
And
I
promise
I
will
never
try

I
know,
I
know,
I'm
an
idiot.
-
And?
-
And?
And?
And...
A
stinkbrain?
The
stinkiest
brain
ever.



KING
CANDY:

I
can
without
a
pinch
that
I
have
never
been
to
say
the
following
words,
let
the
Random
Roster
Race



Okay,
remember,
you
don't
have
to
win.
Just
cross
that
finish
line,
I'm
already
a
real
racer.
And
I'm
going
to
win.



-
Whoa!



Have
some
candy.

Behind
you!
In
front
of
you!
Huh?
-
It's
The
Glitch!
Light
them
up,
Candlehead.

ANNOUNCER:

I
told
you.
You're
just




My
candle!
All
right.
Gotta
keep
it
under
control.
No
more
glitching.
Okay,
kid.
Let's
finish
this
thing
without
any
more
surprises.
Ow!
Hope
you're
happy,
junkpile.
This
game
is
going
down,
My
lady,
you
came
back.
Can
it,
Fix-It!
That
Cy-Bug
you
brought
No.
It
died
in
the
taffy
swamp.

Bullroar.

Listen
up,
people.
Head
to
Move
it!
Let's
go!
Let's
go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
No!

Huh?
Get
off
of
my
track!
Hey!
VANELLOPE:
What,
are
you
crazy!
I
forbid
you
to
cross
that
finish
line!
Knock
it
off!
FELIX:
Ralph,
look!
RALPH:
Kid!
Stop
it!
I'm
not
letting
you

Is
that...
No
way!
What
the...
Who
are
you?
I'm
Turbo,
the
greatest
racer
ever!
And
I
did
not
reprogram
and
that
halitosis-riddled
warthog
take
it
away
from
me!

Turbo-tastic.

End
of
the
line,
Glitch!

Glitch.
That's
it.
Come
on,
Vanellope.
I
know
you
said
you
wouldn't
do
it
again
but
you're
going
to
do
it
one
more
time.
Just
focus
and
concentrate
and
glitch!


Sweet
mother
of
monkey
milk!
I
did
it!
No!

Bring
it
home,
kid!

No!
Kid!
Are
you
okay?
I'm
fine.
I'm
fine.
Let's
finish
this
race!
Oh,
my
land.
All
right.
Come
on.
But
I
didn't
cross
the
finish
line!
RALPH:
There
is
no
finish
line!
Move
it
or
lose
it,
people.
Ralph,
it's
not
going
to
work!
We
got
to
try!
Kid!
Ralph,
I
told
you
I
can't
leave
the
game.
-
Come
on.
Get
through.
It's
got
to
work!
Stop,
it's
no
use.

It's
okay,
Ralph.
CALHOUN:
All
right,
Fix-It.
That's
everyone.
Just
go.
Go
without
me.
-
But
what
about
this
game?
Without
a
beacon,
there's
Beacon?
Stay
with
Felix.
Let
me
borrow
that
thing,
lady.
-
Ralph!
Where
are
you
going?
I'll
meet
you
at
the
finish
line!
No!
Wait!
Fix-It,
get
behind
me!



Come
on!
One
more!
One...
Oh!
Welcome
to
the
boss
level!
Turbo.

I'm
now
the
most
powerful
I
can
take
over
any
game
I
want.
I
should
thank
you
but
it
would
be
more
fun
to
kill
you.
Get
back
here,
little
guy!
Have
some
candy!
Where
do
you
think
you're
going?
I'm
not
through
with
you
yet.
Up
we
go!
No!
Ralph!
Fall
back.

Kid!
Vanellope!
Oh,
look
at
that.
It's
your
little
friend.
Let's
watch
her
die
together,
shall
we?
RALPH:
No!

It's
game
over
for
both
of
you.
No.
Just
for
me!

-
Ralph!
I'm
bad,
and
that's
good.
I
will
never
be
good,
and
that's
not
bad.
There's
no
one
I'd
rather
be...
...than
me.

Kid!
Don't
worry.
I
got
it
under
control.
You
fools!
Why
are
you

No!
No,
no,
no.
Yes...
No!
Yes...
No!
Go
into
the
light!
RALPH:
Whoa!
Chocolate?

It's
chocolate!
I
love
chocolate!

VANELLOPE:
Yeah!
You
did
it,
Ralph!
Way
to
go,
brother!


I...
Excuse...
All
fixed.
-
You
ready
for
this?
Whoa!
What's
with
all
the
magic
sparkles?

Princess
Vanellope?
Now
I
remember.
All
hail
the
rightful
ruler
Princess
Vanellope.

I
remember.
She's
our
princess!
Oh,
that's
right!
We
are
so
sorry
Yeah,
those
were
jokes!

I
was
just
doing
Tut-tut.
As
your
merciful
princess,
that
everyone
who
was
ever
executed.
What?
No,
please!
Oh,
my
land.
Oh!
This
place
just
got
interesting.

I
don't
want
to
die!
I'm
just
kidding.
Stop
crying,
Taffyta.
I'm
trying,
but
it
won't
stop.
Wow.
So
this
is
the
real
you.
Princess.
Aw,
Ralph,
what
are
you,
nuts?
This
is
me.
Huh?
Look,
the
code
may
say
I'm
a
princess
but
I
know
who
I
really
am,
Ralph,
I'm
a
racer
with
I
was
here,
I
was
there.
I
was
glitching
through
the
walls.
I'm
not
giving
that
up.
Um,
pardon
me
for
asking,
but
without
a
princess,
Yeah.
Who?
Uh,
me.
a
constitutional
democracy.
President
Vanellope
von
Schweetz.
Has
a
nice
ring
to
it,
don't
you
think?
Fix-It,
Wreck-It,
Let's
move
'em
out.
You
could
just
stay
here
You'd
have
your
own
wing
where
no
one
would
ever
or
treat
you
bad
ever
again.
You
could
be
happy.
I'm
already
happy.
I've
got
the
coolest
friend
in
the
world.
And
besides,
I've
got
a
job
to
do,
too.
It
may
not
be
as
fancy
but
it's
my
duty.
And
it's
a
big
duty!

Ralph,
are
you
coming,
brother?
See
you
later,
President
Fart
Feathers.
Au
revoir,
Admiral
Underpants.
And
farewell,
Baroness
Boogerface.
Goodbye,
Major

vista,
you...
-
All
right.
To
be
continued.
ALL:
Hooray!
RALPH:
I'm
gonna
wreck
it!

Hey!
Ralph's
back!
Isn't
that
great!

So,
I'm
happy
to
report,
I'm
taking
life
one
game
at
a
time.
All
right!
Yeah,
Ralph!
RALPH:
Of
course,
But,
news
flash,
And
that
got
me
thinking
about
-
So
here's
what
we
did.
We
asked
them
to
help
us
out
We
can
fix
it!
RALPH:
I'm
telling
you,
guys,
we
haven't
been
this
popular
in
years.
-
It's
crazy.
The
gamers
say
we're
"retro,"
which
I
think
means
"old
but
cool."
BOY:
How
come
RALPH:
Oh,
and
I
decided
wasn't
making
me
feel
very
good,
so
I
cleaned
it
up,
and
a
couple
for
the
new
guys,
too.

Well,
with
a
little
help
from
Felix.
Oh!
And
guess
who
was
the
best
man
That's
right,
my
friends,
Very
elegant
affair.
Lot
of
grandeur.
And
not
a
single
bug.
Let's
just
say,
some
tears
were
shed.
But
I
got
to
say,
the
best
part
of
my
day
is
when
I
get
thrown
off
the
roof.
Because
when
the
Nicelanders
I
get
a
perfect
view
of
Sugar
Rush.
And
I
can
see
Vanellope
racing.
Yes!
RALPH:
The
kid's
a
natural.
And
the
players
love
her,
glitch
and
all.
Just
like
I
knew
they
would.
Turns
out
I
don't
need
a
medal
'Cause
if
that
little
kid
likes
me...
How
bad
can
I
be?


Switch
on
the
sky
Go
see
the
world
Don't
close
your
eyes
It's
just
a
matter
of
time
Welcome
to
the
rhythm
of
the
night
There's
something
in
the
air

It's
been
fun
but
now
I've
got
to
go
Life
is
way
too
short
to
take
it
slow
But
before
I
go
and
hit
the
road
I
gotta
know,
'til
then
When
can
I
see
you
again?
When
can
we
do
this
again?
I
gotta
know
Joined
at
the
hip
Life
is
a
trip
down
Look
all
around
at
the
mountains
It's
just
a
matter
of
time
Welcome
to
the
rhythm
of
the
night
There's
something
in
the
air
It's
been
fun
but
now
I've
got
to
go
Life
is
way
too
short
to
take
it
slow
But
before
I
go
and
hit
the
road
I
gotta
know,
'til
then
When
can
I
see
you
again?
When
can
we
do
this
again?
I
gotta
know
Don't
close
your
eyes
It's
just
a
matter
of
time
Welcome
to
the
rhythm
of
the
night
There's
something
in
the
air
So
let
me
know
before
I
wave
goodbye
When
can
I
see
you
again?
When
can
we
do
this
again?
When
can
I
see
you
again?
When
can
we
do
this
again?
Yeah,
it's
been
fun
Life
is
way
too
short
But
before
I
go
and
hit
the
road
When
can
I
see
you
again?
When
can
I
see
you
again?
When
can
I
see
you
again?


Wreck-It
Ralph
is
a
giant
of
a
man
Nine
feet
tall
with
really
big
hands
Living
in
a
stump
on
his
very
own
land
Until
his
world
went
crazy
He
was
minding
his
own
business
They
showed
a
piece
of
paper
They
built
an
apartment
building
So
he
got
mad
And
he
turned
bad
Brick
by
brick
Wreck
it,
Wreck-It
Ralph
You
know
you
can
do
it
So
don't
let
Fix-It
Felix
I
wreck
it
I
fix
it
You
fixed
it!
Fix-It
Felix
is
a
really
great
guy
Watch
him
get
all
turbocharged
Not
just
a
superintendent
And
everybody
loves
him
With
his
trusty
tool
belt
Nicelanders
believe
So
when
Wreck-It
Ralph
He
doesn't
get
mad
Brick
by
brick
he's
gonna
build
it
back
Fix
it,
Fix-It
Felix,
as
fast
as
you
can
Use
the
magic
hammer
'Cause
you
know
Wreck-it
Ralph
I
wreck
it
I
fix
it
You
fixed
it!
