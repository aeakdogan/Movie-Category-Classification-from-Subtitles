but
we

you're

telling
you

we

we
are.
What
do
you

You
see
us
as

in
the
simplest
terms,
You
see
us
as
a

an

a
basket

a
princess...
and
a
criminal.
Correct?
That's

you'll

Okay,
fine.

what's

Is
it

Real

Yeah.
What
did

Yeah.

don't

I'm
trying

Carl,
I've
been
And
each
year...
these
kids
get
more
arrogant.
Aw,
bullshit,
man.
Come
on,
Vern.
The
kids
haven't
You're
teaching
because
you
thought
Thought
you
could
have
Then
you
discovered
That
bummed
you
out.
These
kids
turned
on
me.
They
think
I'm
a
big
fucking
joke.
Come
off
it.
If
you
were
16...
what
would
you
think
of
you?
Do
you
think
I
care
Yes,
I
do.
Think
about
this.
When
we
get
old...
these
kids
will
Yeah.
This
thought
When
I
get
older...
these
kids
will
take
care
of
me.
I
wouldn't
count
on
it.
What
would
I
do
As
little
as
I
had
to.
-
That's
boring.
The
idea
is
to
search
your
mind
Like,
would
you
-
Would
I
have
to
get
out
of
the
car?
-
In
the
spring
or
winter?
-
In
the
front
or
back
of
school?
Yes.
I'd
do
that.
I'll
do
anything
sexual.
-
You're
lying.
I've
done
just
about
everything
I'm
a
nymphomaniac.
Lie.
-
Are
your
parents
aware
of
this?
-
What
did
he
do
when
you
told
him?
Very
nice.
I
don't
think,
from
a
legal
standpoint,
can
be
construed
as
rape
-
He's
an
adult.
Ugh.
Do
you
have
any
idea
-
Well,
the
first
few
times--
-
You
mean
he
did
it
more
than
once?
-
Are
you
crazy?
Have
you
ever
done
it?
I
don't
even
have
a
psychiatrist.
Have
you
ever
done
it
-
Didn't
we
already
cover
this?
I
won't
discuss
my
private
life
-
It's
kind
of
a
double-edged
sword.
Well,
if
you
say
you
haven't,
If
you
say
you
have,
It's
a
trap.
Then
when
you
do,
-
Wrong.
She's
a
tease.
I'm
sure.
You're
a
tease
and
you
know
it.
She's
only
a
tease
-
I
don't
do
anything!
-
Let
me
ask
you
something.
Doesn't
it
bother
you
to
sleep
around
-
Don't
you
want
respect?
That's
the
difference
That's
not
the
only
difference.
-
Face
it.
You're
a
tease.
Sure
you
are.
Sex
is
your
weapon.
You
use
it
to
get
respect.
I
never
said
that.
-
What
do
you
use
it
for
then?
Oh,
are
you
medically
frigid
I
didn't
mean
it
that
way.
Just
answer
the
question.
-

Be
honest.
-
Answer
the
question,
Claire.

-

It's
only
one
question.
I
never
did
it
either.
I'm
not
a
nymphomaniac.
I'm
a
compulsive
liar.
You
are
such
a
bitch!
You
did
that
on
purpose
I
would
do
it.
I
can't
believe
you.
You
don't
say
anything
all
day.
you
unload
all
these
You're
just
pissed
off
because
Fine,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
What's
bizarre?
Some
of
us
are
better
at
hiding
it.
How
are
you
bizarre?
He
can't
think
for
himself.
She's
right.
Know
what
I
did
to
get
in
here?
I
taped
Larry
Lester's
That
was
you?
You
know
him?
Yeah,
I
know
him.
Then
you
know
how
hairy
he
is.
When
they
pulled
the
tape
off...
most
of
his
hair
Oh,
my
god.
And
the
bizarre
thing
is...
that
I
did
it
for
my
old
man.
I
tortured
this
poor
kid...
because
I
wanted
him
He
was
always
going
off
about...
you
know,
when
he
was
in
school...
all
the
wild
things
I
got
the
feeling
that
I
never
cut
loose
So
I'm
sitting
in
the
locker
room...
and
I'm
taping
up
my
knee...
and
Larry's
undressing...
a
couple
of
lockers
down
from
me.
And
he's
kind
of--
He's
kind
of
skinny,
weak.
I
started
thinking
and
his
attitude
The
next
thing
I
knew...
I
jumped
on
top
of
him
My
friends
just
laughed
And
afterwards...
when
I
was
sitting
all
I
could
think
about...
was
Larry's
father...
and
Larry
having
to
go
home...
and
explain
what
happened
to
him.
And
the
humiliation...
the
fucking
humiliation
It
must
have
been
unreal.
How
do
you
apologize
There's
no
way.
It's
all
because
god,
I
fucking
hate
him.
He's
like
this--
He's
like
this
mindless
machine
"Andrew!
You've
got
to
be
number
one!
I
won't
tolerate
Your
intensity
Win!
Win!
Win!"
You
son
of
a
bitch.
You
know,
sometimes,
Then
I
wouldn't
be
able
Then
he
could
forget
all
about
me.
I
think
your
old
man
and
mine
Like
with
my
grades...
Iike
when
l--
when
l--
Iike
when
I
step
outside
And
I
see
me...
I
don't
like
what
I
see.
I
really
don't.
What's
wrong
with
you?
Why
don't
you
like
yourself?
Sounds
stupid,
but...
because
I'm
failing
shop.
We
had
this
assignment,
to
make
this
ceramic
elephant.
And,
um...
we're
supposed
to--
It
was
like
a
lamp.
When
you
pull
the
trunk,
My
light
didn't
go
on.
I
got
an
"F"
on
it.
I've
never
got
an
"F"
in
my
life.
When
I
signed
up
for
the
course...
I
thought
I
was
playing
it
smart.
I
thought,
"I'll
take
shop.
to
maintain
Why'd
you
think
it'd
be
easy?
Have
you
seen
I
take
shop.
Because
I
can't
make
a
lamp?
No,
you're
a
genius
-
What
do
you
know
about
trigonometry?
Without
trigonometry,
-
Without
lamps,
there'd
be
no
light.
I
can
write
with
my
toes.
I
can
also
eat,
brush
my
teeth--
-
With
your
feet?
-
I
can
make
spaghetti.
I
can,
uh,
-
I
want
to
see
what
Claire
can
do.
Everybody
can
do
something.
There's
one
thing
I
can
do.
Forget
it.
Ever
seen
"Wild
Kingdom"?
Okay.
You
have
to
swear
to
god
Okay.
I
can't
believe
That's
great!
Where'd
you
learn
to
do
that?
Camp,
seventh
grade.
That
was
great,
Claire.
My
image
of
you
You're
a
shit.
-
You
swore
to
god
you
wouldn't
laugh.
You
fucking
prick!
What
do
you
care
what
I
think?
I
don't
even
count,
right?
I
could
disappear
forever
I
may
as
well
not
even
exist
And,
you,
I
have
just
as
And
it
hurts
just
as
much
god,
you're
so
pathetic!
Don't
you
ever...
ever,
compare
yourself
You
got
everything,
Fucking
Rapunzel,
right?
School
would
probably
shut
down
Queenie
isn't
here.
I
like
those
earrings,
Claire.
Shut
up.
-
Are
those
real
diamonds,
Claire?
I
bet
they
are.
-
Did
you
work
for
the
money
for
those?
-
Or
did
Daddy
buy
them
for
you?
I
bet
he
bought
those.
I
bet
those
were
Know
what
I
got
for
Christmas?
It
was
a
banner-fucking-year
I
got
a
carton
of
cigarettes.
The
old
man
grabbed
me
and
said,
go
home
and
cry
to
your
daddy.
Will
we
be
like
our
parents?
Not
me...
ever.
It's
unavoidable.
Just
happens.
What
happens?
When
you
grow
up...
your
heart
dies.
Who
cares?
I
care.
I
was
just
thinking,
I
know
it's
kind
but
I
was
just
what
will
happen
When
we're
all
together
again.
I
consider
you
guys
my
friends.
Am
I
wrong?
No.
So
on
Monday,
what
happens?
Still
friends,
you
mean?
If
we're
friends
now?
Yeah.
Want
the
truth?
Yeah,
I
want
the
truth.
I
don't
think
so.
With
all
of
us
or
just
John?
With
all
of
you.
-
That's
a
real
nice
attitude,
Claire.
If
Brian
came
up
to
you
on
Monday,
Picture
this.
You
know
exactly
what
you'd
do.
you'd
cut
him
up
so
your
friends
No
way.
Okay.
What
if
I
came
up
to
you?
-
The
same
exact
thing.
Why?
Because
I'm
telling
No!
'Cause
you
know
how
shitty
And
you
don't
have
the
balls
What
about
you,
you
hypocrite?
Why
don't
you
take
Allison
Take
Brian
or
Andy
out
to
What
would
your
friends
say
if
we
were
They'd
laugh
their
asses
off.
You'd
say
we
were
doing
it,
Don't
talk
about
my
friends!
You
don't
And
you
certainly
wouldn't
Just
stick
to
what
you
know:
shopping,
-
your
drunk
mother
in
the
Caribbean--
As
far
as
being
concerned
about
us
Forget
it!
Just
bury
your
head
-
I
hate
you!
I
assume
Allison
and
I
are
Us
weirdos?
-
Would
you
do
that
to
me?
-
Well,
if
you
did?
I
don't
think
my
kind
I
just
want
to
tell
each
of
you
I
wouldn't
and
I
will
not.
Because
I
think
that's
real
shitty.
Your
friends
wouldn't
mind
You're
so
conceited,
Claire.
You're
so
conceited.
You're
so
full
of
yourself.
Why?
I'm
not
saying
that
I
hate
having
to
go
along
Then
why
do
you
do
it?
I
don't
know.
I
don't--
You
don't
understand.
You're
not
friends
with
the
people
You
don't
understand
the
pressure
I
don't
understand
what?
You
think
I
don't
Well,
fuck
you!
Fuck
you!
You
know
why
I'm
here
today?
Do
you?
I'm
here...because...
Mr.
Ryan
found
-
Why'd
you
have
a
gun?
You
pull
the
fucking
trunk...
and
the
light's
supposed
to
go
on.
It
didn't
go
on.
-
What's
the
gun
for?
You
brought
it
up,
man.
I
can't
have
an
"F."
I
can't
have
it...
and
I
know
Even
if
I
ace
I'm
still
only
a
"B."
Brian.
Considering
my
options,
-
Killing
yourself
is
not
an
option.
No.
I
don't
think
so.
It
was
a
handgun?
It
was
a
flare
gun.
Really?
It's
not
funny.
Yes,
it
is.
Fucking
elephant
was
destroyed.
Know
what
I
did
Nothing.
I
didn't
have
anything
You're
laughing
at
me.
No.
Yeah,
you
are.
It
seems
so
clear
in
black
and
white
The
living
color
Like
dynamite
Just
imagine
my
surprise
When
I
looked
into
your
eyes
and
saw
Through
your
disguise
If
we
dare
expose
our
hearts
And
just
reveal
the
purest
thoughts
And
that
is
when
We
are
not
alone
You
find
out
There'll
be
somebody
there
We
are
not
alone
'Cause
when
you
We're
really
not
Brian?
Hmm?
Are
you
going
to
write
your
paper?
Yeah.
Why?
It's
a
waste
for
all
of
us
Vernon
wants
us
to.
True,
but
I
think
You
just
don't
want
True,
but...
you're
the
smartest,
right?
Well...
We
trust
you.
Yeah.
All
right.
I'll
do
it.
great.
Come
on.
Where
are
we
going?
Come
on.

Don't
be
afraid.
Don't
stick
that
in
my
eye.
I'm
not
sticking
it.
Just--
-

good.
You
look
better
without
all
that
Hey,
I
like
that
black
shit.
This
looks
a
lot
better.
Look
up.

Please.
Why
are
you
being
'Cause
you're
letting
me.

You
lost?
Thank
you.
Why'd
you
do
that?
'Cause
I
knew
you
wouldn't.
You
said
before
your
parents
use
you
Wouldn't
I
be
outstanding
Were
you
really
disgusted
about
Truth?
Truth.
No.
What
happened
to
you?
Why?
Claire
did
it.
What's
wrong?
Nothing's
wrong.
It's
just...
just
so
different.
I
can
see
your
face.
Is
that
good
or
bad?
That's
good.
See
you,
Brian.
See
you
next
Saturday.
You
bet.
Won't
you
come
see
about
me
I'll
be
alone
Dancing,
you
know
it,
baby
Tell
me
your
troubles
and
doubts
giving
me
everything
Love's
strange
Think
of
the
tender
things
That
we
were
working
on
Slow
change
may
pull
us
apart
When
the
light
gets
Don't
you
Forget
about
me
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't
Don't
you
Forget
about
me
Will
you
stand
above
me
Look
my
way
but
never
love
me
Rain
keeps
fallin'
Rain
keeps
fallin'
down
Down,
down
Will
you
recognize
me
Call
my
name
or
walk
on
by
As
the
rain
keeps
fallin'
Rain
keeps
fallin'
down
Down,
down
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey

We
accept
the
fact
a
whole
Saturday
in
detention
We
think
you're
crazy
to
make
us
You
see
us
as
in
the
simplest
terms,
But
what
we
found
out...
is
that
each
one
of
us
-

and
an
athlete...
-

a
princess...

Sincerely
yours...
the
Breakfast
Club.
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't
Don't
you
Forget
about
me
As
you
walk
on
by
Will
you
call
my
name
As
you
walk
on
by
Will
you
call
my
name
When
you
walk
away
When
you
walked
into
the
room
I
could
see
you
were
no
fool
Is
that
smile
a
sight
for
me
Only
if
my
heart
could
see
Will
I
make
your
body
cry
Cry
so
loud
you
never
hear
In
the
shadows
of
my
life
Can
I
take
you
home
tonight
Your
heart
too
hot
to
hold
Just
a
flame
that
burns
my
soul
Heart
too
hot
to
hold
Too
hot,
too
hot
Too
hot
to
hold
Heart
too
hot
to
hold
A
flame
that
burns
my
soul
