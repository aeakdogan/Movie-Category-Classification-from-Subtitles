what
we
should
get?
You
know
those
hearts
We
should
get
a
three-way
one.
I
don't
even
know
We
should
make
the
first
one.
I
want
the
middle
piece,
so
I
know
we've
gone
over
this
again
and
again,
I
know
I
fucked

myself
with
you.

me

the
verge
Am

I'm
stoned

been
shot,
like,
seven
times.
You're
losing
stuff.
Yeah.
SAUL:

RED:
Yeah,

DALE:
Here
comes
the
airplane.


It's
a
miracle.
I
think

think
about
what

miracle
And

friends
and,
like,
kind
of

RED:
Oh.
It
is
bad.

RED:
That's
a
bullet
