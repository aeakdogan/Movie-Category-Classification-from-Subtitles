just
wrong.
How

I
got
an
idea.
It's
really
simple.
We
just
Er,
nah.
It's--
-
What
?
A
bet
?
No
money
involved.
Here's
the
deal.
Dude,
it's
not
like
I
haven't
Think
about
when
you
work
out,
Oz.
Someone
to
spot
you.
Well,
that's
exactly
what
I
mean,
we'll
be
there

dragon-style
-
Guys

Fight,
and
find
out
who
is
number

ruining
my
moment
here.

must
make
No
longer
will
our
penises
We
will
fight
for
every
man
out
there
This
is
our
day.
And,
by
God,
we
will
not
stand
by
and
-
Amen.
Yes.
-We
will
make
a
stand.
We
will
succeed.
-
We
will
get
laid
!

Now,
the
sex:
It's
got
-
No
prostitutes.

So,
basically,
-
Oh,
dude.
Prom
sucks.
but
you
gotta
think
I
mean,
all
the
parties
afterwards
?
-
Yeah-yeah,
he's
right.
It's,

So,
that
gives
us--

We're

And
I'm

I
learned
Hey,

thought
Chuck
Sherman
is
a
liar.
I
never
had
sex

him.
He's
never
had
sex
with
anyone.
Once
he
tried
to
screw
Oh.
He
also
told
me
that
when
he
gets

you
How

Look,

Iooking

This
may

I
feel
like
And,
uh,
Oz,

It's
what
your
friends
I
mean,
I
feel
like
I'm
And...

This
feeling
inside
me

So,

you.
But
it
takes
the
edge
off,
-
Where's
your
little
date
tonight
?
It
was
a
bathroom
incident.
-
Pardon
me
?
You
have
I
believe
the
kegs
That
is
what
I'm
talking
about
-
The
good
stuff.
I
got
some
scotch.
-
Single
malt
?
The
way
I
like
it.
Why
don't
you
go
I
think
I
should.
Allow
me.
You
know
it's
The
Stif-man

And
then
he
just
-
That
is
a
nasty
story.
Do
you
want
to
hear
It's
sort
of
sexual.
Yeah
!
Okay,
well,
this
one
time
at
band
camp,
I
don't
know
if
you
know
it,
And
I
had
to
kiss
this
guy
And-And
he
plays

So
how
do
you
Like...

do
you
I
don't
know.
Like...
normal
style.
Okay.

Don't
ever
go

-**
-**
I
should
be
-**
You
know
it
gets
-**
Sometimes
-
-**
I
fall
into
an
ocean
of
you
-**
-**
Pull
me
out
in
time
-**
-

-**
Let
me
down
-**
You

-**
Yeah,
I
need
to
know
-**
-**
All
about
you

-**
Say

So
the
end
of
the
story
had
to
kiss
the
guy
Yes

And
he
was
such
a
dork.
-
but
I
didn't
care
And
this
one
time
at
band
camp,
Hmm.

What
?
You
don't
think
I
know
Hell,
that's
what
So

This'll

you
think
Come

I
saw
you
on
the
'Net.

You're
a
sure
thing.
Yes,
I
am.
So
I
said,
"This
is
very
obviously

So,

you
object
if
I
said
Mr.
Finch,

And
no
way
to
be
sure
-**
-**
Why
everything's

lnstilling
so
much
doubt
-**
-**
It
makes
me
so
tired
-**
-**
I
feel
so
uninspired
-**
-**
My
head
is
battling

My
logic
has
been
torn
apart
