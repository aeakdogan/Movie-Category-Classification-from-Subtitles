RAY:
After

washed
the
residue
off
me

and
walked
home
Shortly
thereafter,
'Get

out
of
London,
'Get

Bruges:'
I
didn't

It's

Belgium.
RAY:
Bruges
is
a
shithole.
KEN:
Bruges

Bruges
is
a
shithole.
Ray,
we've
only
just
Could
we
reserve
judgment
on
Bruges
I
know
it's
gonna
be


Shithole.

I
think
you
have
a
couple
of
rooms
Yes.
No,
we
have
one
room
booked.
One
twin
room.
Two
weeks!
Do
you
have
another
room?
No,
I'm
afraid
we're
fully
booked.
With
Christmas,
Okay.

It's
very
pretty.
I'm
not
being
funny,
We've
got
to
stay
here
Well,

if
he
doesn't
Then
we
stay
here
for
two
weeks.
For
two
weeks?
In
fucking
Bruges?
With
you?
No
way!
Ray,
I
really
don't
like
to
say
this.
You
really
don't
like
to
say
what?
Well.
You
know?
Fucking
bring
that
up.
Do
you
think
this
is
good?
Do
I
think
what's
good?
You
know,
going
round
in
a
boat,
Yes,
I
do.
It's
called
'sightseeing.'
Oh,
look
at
that.
It's
a
former
hospital.
Bruges
is
the
most
in
the
whole
of
Coming
up?
The
view.
The
view
of
what?
Ray,
you're
about
Ken,
I
grew
up
in
Dublin.
If
I'd

on
a
farm

MAN:
Been

top
of
the

Yeah.
Yeah,
it's
rubbish.
It
is?
The
guidebook
says
Well,

there.
Pardon
me?
Why?
I
mean,

Right,

fatty.

You
know,
you're
just
What's
all
that
about?
They're
not
going
up
there.
Hey,
guys,
I
wouldn't
go
up
there.
Screw
you,
motherfucker!
Americans,
isn't
it?
Now,
this
is
more
like
it.
One
gay
beer
and
one
normal
beer
for
me,

This
is
the
life.
We're
not
staying
here
getting
pissed.
We
are
quietly
sightseeing,
and
awaiting
his
call
This
is
my
vote
We
give
it
another
day,
Then
we
check
the
papers
again,
we
phone
him
and
say,
'Harry,
'it's
been
very
nice,
all
the
'but
we're
coming
back
to
London
now,
'where
it
isn't
all
just
My
vote
would
be
and
await
his
call
You
don't
even
know
What
are
you
talking
about?
You
don't
even
know
-
What,
on
a
job?
-
Here
in
Bruges?
-
Here
in
Bruges,
on
a
job?
Why?
What
did
he
actually
say?
He
didn't
actually
say
anything.
-
Then
why
do
you
think
it
might
be?
But
it's
a
bit
fucking
-
'Go
take
him
to
hide
out.'
'Go
take
him
to
hide
out
You
can
hide
out
in
Croydon.
Hmm.
Or
Coventry.
Hmm.
It
is
a
bit
over-elaborate.
Hmm.
But
we
haven't
got
any
guns.
Harry
can
get
guns
anywhere.

He's
not
gonna
ring
tonight.

He's
not
gonna
ring
tonight.
Let's
go
out.
-
Go
out
where?
No!
Let's
go
out
and
have
a
look
All
the
old
medieval
Because
I
bet
they
look
even
Yes!
That
there
is
called
They
all
have
funny
names,
Yes,
Flemish.
In
here
it
says,
'The
Belgians
'from
being
murdered,
1471
and
1651.'
I
used
to
hate
history,
It's
all
just
a
load
of
stuff
What
are
they
doing
over
there?
They're
filming
something.
Ray!
MAN:
So,
on
this
scene,
you're
supposed
Okay?
Great.
Ray,
come
on,
let's
go.
My
arse,
'Let's
go.'
Oh,
my
God!
She's
gorgeous!
Ray,
we're
going
right
now.
Fuck
off,
are
we!
This
is
the
best
bit
of
Bruges
Hello.
Do
you
speak
English?
Yes,
you
do.
What
are
you
filming
midgets
for?
It's
a
Dutch
movie.
It's
a
pastiche
of
Nicholas
Roeg's
Not
a
pastiche,
but
a...
A
'homage'
is
too
strong.
Wow,
your
English
is
very
good.
A
lot
of
midgets
A
disproportionate
amount.
Herv
Villechaize,
I
think
somebody
I
suppose
they
must
being
really
little
and
that.
People
looking
at
them
Calling
them
names.
There's
another
famous
It's
not
the
R2-D2
man.
I
hope
your
midget
doesn't
kill
himself.
He
doesn't
like
being
called
a
midget.
Well,
this
is
exactly
my
point!
People
go
around
calling
you
a
midget
Of
course
you're
-
My
name's
Ray.
What's
yours?
How
did
you
get
past
Getting
past
security
men,
You're
a
shoplifter?

No,
not
a
shoplifter.
It's
a
good
joke,
though.
No.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
am

Fuck.
How
fucking
cool.
Mr.
Blakely?
-
Yes.
No,
Mr.
Cranham.
You
have
a
message.
Shit!
HARRY:
Number
one,
why
aren't
you
Number
two,
why
doesn't

hotel
and
not
I
have
to
leave
messages
Number
three,

be
in
or
there'll
be
fucking
Hell
to
pay,

Would
you
turn
Sorry,
Ken.
Keep
the
fucking
noise
down!
Someone's
in
a
mood.

You'll
never
guess
what.
Will
you
shut
your
fucking
mouth,
Oh,
sorry.
Except
I've
gotta
take
me
Altogether,
I
had
five
pints
of
beer
No.
Six
pints
of
beer
And
you
know
what?
You'll
never
guess
what,
Ken.
-
Ken,
you'll
never
guess
what.
Got
a
date
for
tomorrow
night.
I'm
very
happy
for
you.
With
a
girl.
Can
you
turn
Only
been
in
Bruges
one
day,
got
a
date

Belgian
film
business.
They're
doing
a
film
about
a
midget.
Miss?
Marie?
Sorry

the
message
last
night.
Well,

bit
of
a...
Cock?
Yes.
He's
a
bit
of
a
cock.
Morning.
Harry
called
last
night.
We
missed
him.
Jeez,
he
swears
a
lot,
doesn't
he?
We're
staying
in
tonight.
Hmm.
Except...
Hmm.
Except
'hmm'
what?
Except
only
one
of
us
Uh-huh.
And
which
one
of
us
I
thought
you
didn't
like
Bruges.
I
don't
like
Bruges,
But
I
did
already
say
I
had
a
date
in
the
Belgian
film
business,
Just
don't
get
into
We're
keeping
a
low
profile.
And
this
morning,
we
are
doing
what
I
want
to
do.
-
Got
it?
Which,
I
presume,
Oh,
we
shall
strike
a
balance
Somehow
I
believe,
Ken,
that
the
Like
a
big,
fat,
fucking
retarded,
on
a
seesaw,
opposite
a
dwarf.


Ray,
did
we
that
if
I
let
you
we'd
do
the
things
We
are
doing
the
things
And
that
we'd
do
them
without
you
like
some
5-year-old
who's
dropped
I
didn't
agree
to
that.
I'll
cheer
up.
Up
there,
the
top
altar,
is
a
phial
brought
back
by
a
Flemish
knight
And
that
phial,
do
you
know
what
No,
what's
it
It's
said
to
contain
some
drops
of
Yeah,
that's
how
this
church
got
Yeah.
Yeah.
And
this
blood,
right,
at
different
times
over
many
years,
Turned
back
into
liquid
At
various
times
of
great
stress.
-
Yeah?
So,
yeah,
I'm
gonna
go
up
in
the
queue
-
Yeah?
Do
I
have
to?
-
Do
you
have
to?
It's
Jesus'
fucking
blood,
isn't
it?
Of
course
you
don't
You
little
fucking
cunt.

RAY:
Murder,
Father.
PRIEST:
Why
did
you
For
money,
Father.
For
money?
You
murdered
someone
for
money?
Yes,
Father.
Not
out
of
anger,
not
out
of
nothing.

Who
did
you
murder
You,
Father.
I'm
sorry?
I
said
you,
Father.
Harry
Waters
says
hello.
The
little
boy.
RAY:
I
quite
like
this
one.
All
the
rest
were
rubbish
by
spastics,
What's
that
all
about,
then?
-
It's
Judgment
Day,
you
know?
What's
that
then?
Well,
it's,
you
know,
When
mankind
will
be
judged
for
all
And
see
who
gets
into
Heaven
and
Yeah.
And
what's
the
other
place?
Purgatory.
Purgatory?
Purgatory's
kind
of
like
You
weren't
really
shit,
but
you
Like
Tottenham.
Do
you
believe
About
Tottenham?
The
Last
Judgment
Guilt
and
sins
and
Hell
and
all
that?
Um...
Well...
KEN:
I
don't
know,
Ray.
The
things
you're
taught
as
a
child,
So,
like,
I
believe
in
trying
Like,
if
there's
an
old
lady,
I
don't
try
and
help
her
carry
her
but
I'll
certainly
hold
Yeah.
And
anyway,
if
you
tried
to
she'd
probably
think
you
were
Exactly.
This
is
the
world
At
the
same
time
as
trying
to
lead
I
have
to
reconcile
myself
with
the
Not
many
people.
Most
of
them
were
Apart
from
one
person.
Who's
that?
This
fellow,
He
was
just
trying
to
protect
He
was
just
a
lollipop
man.
He
came
at
me
with
a
bottle.
I
shot
him
down.
Hmm.
In
my
book,
though,
sorry,
that
is
a
deadly
weapon,
I
know
that
in
my
heart.
I
also
know
that
he
was
just
trying
I
know.
But
a
bottle,
It's
a
case
of
If
he'd
come
at
you
with
his
That
wouldn't
Well,
technically,
your
bare
hands
They
can
be
deadly
weapons,
too.
You
said
he
was
He
was
a
lollipop
man.
What's
a
lollipop
man
doing
I'm
just
saying.
-
How
old
was
he?
What's
a
50-year-old
lollipop
man
What
was
he,
Jesus,
Ken,
I'm
trying
to
I
know
what
you're
I
killed
a
little
boy.
You
didn't
mean
I
know
I
didn't
mean
to.
But
because
of
the
choices
I
made
and
a
little
boy
And
he'll
never
be
here
again.
I
mean
here
in
the
world,
Well,
he'll
never
be
here
in
Belgium,
I
mean,
he
might
have
wanted
I
don't
know
why.

And
that's
all
because
of
me.
He's
dead
because
of
me.
And
I'm
trying
to...
I'm
trying
to
get
me
head
I
will
always
have
That
ain't
ever
Unless...
Maybe
I
go
away.
Don't
even
think
like
that.

You
look
good.
What's
it
matter
anyway?

So,
what
do
you
do,
Raymond?
I
shoot
people
for
money.

What
kinds
of
people?
Priests.
Children.
Is
there
a
lot
of
money
to
be
made
There
is
in
priests.
So
what
is
it
you
do,
Chloe?
I
sell
cocaine
and
heroin
Do
you?
Do
I
look
like
I
do?
You
do,
actually.

Do
I
look
like
No.
Just
children.
Mmm-hmm.
I
saw
your
midget
today.
Well,
he's
on
a
lot
of
ketamine.
What's
that?
Horse
tranquilizer.
A
horse
tranquilizer?
-
Where'd
he
get
that?
You
can't
sell
horse
tranquilizers
This
movie,
I
think
it's
gonna
be
There's
never
been
a
classic
movie
Of
course
there
hasn't,
Bruges
is
my
hometown,
Ray.
Well,
it's
still
a
shithole.
It's
not
a
shithole.
What?
Even
midgets
have
to
Okay.
So,
you've
insulted
my
hometown.
You're
doing
very
well,
Raymond.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
some
I
don't
know
any
Belgian
jokes.
And
if
I
did,
I
think
I'd
have
Hey,
hang
on.
Is
Belgium
where
there
Then
I
do
know
a
Belgian
joke.
What's
Belgium
famous
for?
Chocolates
and
child
abuse.
And
they
only
invented
the
chocolates
What?
One
of
the
girls
they
murdered
was

I'm
sorry,
Chloe.
One
of
the
girls
they
murdered
I
just
wanted
to
And
it
worked.
Fucking
unbelievable.
What's
fucking
unbelievable?
Are
you
talking
to
me?

He
pauses,
even
though
he
And
he
repeats.
Yes,
I
am
talking
to
you.
Well,
I'll
tell
you
what's
Blowing
cigarette
smoke
straight
into
That's
fucking
unbelievable!
-
This
is
the
smoking
section.
All
right?
I
don't
wanna
Isn't
that
what
the
Vietnamese?
What
are
you
That
statement
makes
-
Yes
it
does.
Well,
saying
it
over
and
over
ain't
How
does
the
Vietnamese
to
myself
and
my
girlfriend
your
friend's
cigarette
smoke?
Tell
me
how
saying...
That's
for
John
Lennon,
A
bottle?
No,
don't
bother.

We're
leaving.
I
don't
hit
women!
I'd
hit
a
woman
who
was
trying
to
That's
different.
Or
a
woman
who
could
do
karate.
I'd
never
hit
a
woman
generally,
Chloe.
God,
you're
pretty.
I
have
to
make
a
call.
Oh,
no.
You've
gone
off
me,
now,
haven't
you?


Hello?
We
just
popped
out
for
some
dinner,
Yeah?
What'd
you
have?
-
For
dinner?
Pizza,
at
Pizza
Hut.
Was
it
nice?
Yeah,
it
was
all
right.
The
same
as
in
England.
Well,
that's
globalization,
He's
in
the
toilet.
-
Can
he
hear?
What's
he
doing?
-
What
do
you
mean?
I
don't
know,
Harry,
Send
him
out
on
an
errand
for
half

Ray?
Why
don't
you
go
out
down
Yeah,
yeah,
I
know
I
said
you
couldn't,
but
might
as
well
enjoy
ourselves,
eh?
No,
I
don't
know
if
they've
got
Yeah,
see
you.
Yeah.
He's
gone.
What'd
you
say
to
him?
I
said,
'Why
don't
you
go
have
a
drink,
-
What
did
he
say?
And
he
might
go
have
a
look
to
see
Was
he
just
having
a
wee?
Yeah,
I
think
so.
Sure
he
didn't
mind?
No,
he
was
glad
to
get
out.
He's
definitely
gone?
Yeah,
yeah,
he
slammed
the
door.
That
don't
mean
he's
gone.
Harry,
he's
definitely
gone.
You
realize
there
are
no
I
realize
that,
Harry.
What
are
they
gonna
have,
As
I
say,
I
think
he
was
just
glad
So,
is
he
having
a
nice
time,
I
had
a
lovely
time
All
the
canals
and
the
When
were
you
here?
When
I
was
seven.
-
Have
you
been
on
a
canal
trip,
yet?
Have
you
been
down,
like,
Yeah.
It's
like
a
fairytale,
With
the
churches
and
that.
-
Is
it
Gothic?
So
he's
having
Well,
I'm
having
I'm
not
sure
if
it's
What?
You
know,
I'm
not
sure
What
do
you
mean,
What's
that
supposed
to
mean,
What
the
fuck
is
that
Nothing,
Harry.
It's
a
fairytale
How
can
a
fairytale
town
not
be
How
can
all
those
canals
and
bridges
all
that
beautiful
how
can
that
not
be
What
I
think
I
meant
to
say
was:
-
Is
the
swan
still
there?
How
can
fucking
swans
not
fucking
How
can
that
be?
What
I
think
I
meant
to
say
was,
when
he
first
arrived,
You
know,
there's
that
big,
dual
It
mightn't
have
been
here
when
you
Well,
as
soon
as
he
got
into,
and
he
saw
the
canals
and
the
bridges
and,
well,
he
just
Couldn't
get
enough
of
it,
It
was
just
that
initial,
dual
carriageway
Don't
know
if
I
remember
Must
be
recent.
Hasn't
spoilt
it,
has
it?
No,
no,
no,
it's
just
that
And
you
know
what?
As
we
were
walking
there
was
this
sort
of
freezing
fog
and
it
made
it
look
almost
like
And
he
turned
to
me,
What'd
he
say?
He
said,
'Ken,
I
know
I'm
awake,
Yeah?
He
said
that?
Yeah.
Meaning,
like,
Yeah.
Of
course,
Oh,
good:
I'm
glad
I'm
glad
we
were
able
Something
good
and
happy.
Because
he
Huh?
He
wasn't
a
bad
kid,
Listen,
take
down
this
address.
That's
'Raam,'
like
'Ram,'
Raamstraat
17.
You
got
that?
Yes,
Raamstraat
17.
Good:
There'll
be
a
man
there
tomorrow

Yuri.
Ring
me
on
the
public
phone
about
3:00
or
4:00
tomorrow,
After
what's
done?
Are
you
being
thick?
-
No.
He
was
a
good
bloke,
but
when
it
he
blew
the
head
off
a
little
So
if
the
buck
don't
stop
with
him,
Ken?
If
the
buck
don't
stop
with
him,
It
stops
with
me,
Harry.
Look,
don't
get
shirty,
Ken.
Listen,
I'm
just
glad
that
I
was
able
Do
what
for
the
boy?
You
know,
have
him
I'd
like
to
go
to
see
What
was
it
he
said
again
about:
'I
know
I'm
awake,
but
I
feel
like
Yeah.
Give
me
a
call

That's
my
fucking
girlfriend,
Eirik,
what
are
you
doing?
Where
are
you
from,
fucker?
Ireland,
originally.
And
you
think
it's
okay
and
fuck
another
man's
girl?
Look,
I
didn't
know
she
had
And
I
haven't
fucked
her,
anyway.
Eirik,
put
the
gun
down!
Get
down
on
your
knees
Don't
start
being
silly.
Get
down
on
your:
Exactly
at
what
point
was
it
that
Used
to
be,
you
just
went
around
beating
up
Now
it
seems
a
prerequisite
That's
not
gonna
help
you,
man.
Ray,
there's
only
Eirik,
don't!
Now
who's
the
fucking
bum-boy?
You,
you
fucking
bum-boy!

Chloe,
what
exactly
I
can't
see!
Of
course
you
can't
-
Is
this
fella
your
boyfriend?
Well,
what's
he
doing
here?
We...
We
rob
tourists,
sometimes.
I
fucking
knew
it
was
too
good
I
knew
you'd
have
never
No!
That's
not
true,
I...
I
called
it
off
tonight.
Why
did
you
come
tonight?
EIRIK:
Chloe,
I
can't
see,
Stop
whingeing
I
haven't
had
a
shag
in
months!
I
can't
see
out
of
this
eye,
Chloe!
I'll
drive
you.
Great!
Now
the
whole
No!
You
can
stay
if
you
want.
I
just
I
just
knew
someone
like
you
-
I
just
knew.
You
know,
someone
nice.
Call
me.
Please.
EIRIK:
Chloe!
Cha-ching!

Have
you
got
some
No,
no
problem.
Four
beers
in
20
minutes.
Fuck
off.
JIMMY:
Beer
and
a
red
wine.
I'll
be
back.
How's
the
movie
going?
It's
a
jumped-up
Eurotrash
piece
of
Like,
in
a
bad
way?
Your
girlfriend's
She
ain't
my
girlfriend.
Didn't
know
there
were
You
just
have
to
look
Brothels
are
good.
Well,
you've
picked
up
Thank
you.
You
from
the
States?
Yeah.
But
don't
hold
it
against
me.
I'll
try
not
to.
Just
try
not
to
say
Hey-ho.
Drowning
What
sorrows?
One
gay
beer,
please.
How'd
your
date
go?
My
date
involved
two
instances
of
One
instance
of
her
hand
on
my
cock
which
lasted
all
too
briefly.
One
instance
of
me
stealing
five
grams
of
and
one
instance
of
me
So,
all
in
all,
my
evening
You
got
five
grams
of
coke?
I've
got
four
grams
on
me
which
is
why
me
heart
as
if
I'm
about
to
So
if
I
collapse
any
minute
now,
that
it
might
have
something
Give
us
a
gram,
then.
I
thought
you
were
laying
off,
You
know
what?
Right
now,
Why
didn't
you
wave
hello
to
me
I
was
on
a
very
strong
I
wasn't
waving
hello
to
anybody,
Huh?
What
are
you
Just
horseshit.
You
from
America?
Yeah.
But
don't
Well,
that's
for
me
Are
you
from
America,
too?
No,
I'm
from
Amsterdam.

Amsterdam.
Amsterdam
is
just
a
load
of
bloody
Yes.
That's
why
I
came
to
Bruges.
I
thought
I'd
get
Huh?
You
two
are
weird.
Would
you
like
some
cocaine?
I've
also
got
some

Herv
Villechaize,
I
know,
did.
The
dwarf
off,
I
think,
Lots
of
midgets:
Dwarves,
top
themselves.
Hmm.
Shitloads.
Would
you
ever
think
about
it?
Huh?
Would
you
ever
think
about
killing
Fuck,
man!
We're
just
chatting,
See,
Ken,
this
is
the
kind
of
hotel
A
five-star,
You
know,
sometimes,
I
think
Harry
Has
he
still
not
called?
No.
Still
hasn't
called.
No
news
is
good
news,
eh?

RAY:
Hmm.
Who's
she?
JIMMY:
There's
gonna
be
a
war,
man.
I
can
see
it.
There's
gonna
be
a
war
between
the
You
ain't
even
gonna
need
This
ain't
gonna
be
a
war
Your
side's
already
And
I
know
whose
side
I'm
fighting
on.
The
whites
are
gonna
get
JIMMY:
You
don't
decide
Well,
who
are
the
half-castes
The
blacks,
man.
But
what
about
the
Pakistanis?
The
blacks.
Think
of
a
hard
one.
What
about
the
Vietnamese?
The
blacks!
Well,
I'm
definitely
fighting
with
So,
hang
on.
Would
all
of
the
white
midgets
in
against
all
the
black
Yeah.
That
would
make
a
good
film!
You
don't
know
how
much
shit
I've
had
That's...
Undeniably
true.
See,
Jimmy,
my
wife
was
black.
And
I
loved
her
very
much.
And
in
1976,
she
was
murdered
So,
where
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
Did
they
get
the
guy
who
did
it?
A
friend
of
mine
got
him.
Harry
Waters
got
him.
So
tell
me,
Jim,
whose
side
do
I
fight
I
think
you
need
to
and
let
your
conscience
decide,
Ken.
Two
manky
hookers
I
think
I'm
heading
home.
Yeah.
I
think
I'll
come
with
you.
What's...
You
don't
know
karate.
Don't
say
you
didn't
Don't
say
you
didn't
Shortarse!
Meeting
Yuri.
Yes,
I'm
Yuri.
Mr.
Waters
said
There
are
a
lot
of
alcoves
You
use
this
word,
'Alcoves'?
Yes.
Sometimes.
There
are
not
many
people
around
If
I
were
to
murder
a
man,
Are
you
sure
this
is
'Alcoves,'
yes.
'Nooks
and
crannies,'
yes.
'Nooks
and
crannies,'
You
are
going
to
do
it,
aren't
you?
Of
course
I'm
going
to
fucking
do
it.
It's
what
I
do.
Your
friend
was
behaving
Oddly?
How?
Well,
he
asked
me
about
the
baby,
I
said
I
didn't
mind
as
long
as
But
then
he
gave
me
200
euros
I
refused,
obviously,
Would
you
give
it
back
to
him
I
don't
want
to
appear
ungrateful,
but
it
-
Do
you
know
where
he
is
now?
Sorry,
Ray.
I'm
sorry.
Ray,
don't!
Fucking
hell!
-
I
was
behind
the
thing.
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
Nothing.

Oh,
my
God!
-
You
were
gonna
kill
me.
You
were
gonna
kill
yourself!
I'm
allowed
to.
No,
you're
not!
What?
I'm
not
allowed
to
and
you
are?
Can
we
go
somewhere
I
wasn't
gonna
go
You
fucking
looked
like
you
were
Where'd
you
get
that
gun?
A
friend
of
Harry's.
Fuck,
man.
Let
me
see
it.
Silencer,
too.
Nice.
Mine's
a
bloody
girl's
gun.
I'm
keeping
it.
Give
me
me
gun
back.
You're
a
suicide
case.
And
you
were
trying
to
shoot
me
You're

Listen,
I'm
gonna
give
you
some
money
Back
to
England?
You
can't
go
back
to
England,
Ray.

I
want
to
be
a
dead
man.
Have
you
been
missing
something?
You
don't
want
to
be
I
killed
a
little
boy!
Then

the
next
little
boy.
Just

this
business
You're

But
you
might
save
the
next
one.
What
am
I
gonna
be,
a
doctor?
You

exams.
Do
anything,
Ray.
RAY:
What
a
wanker!
He
said
this
whole
trip,
this
whole
being
in
Bruges
thing,
was
just
to
give
you
one
last,
In
Bruges?

The
Bahamas,

Why

Bruges?
I
suppose
it's
cheaper.

The
rest
of
the
acid
Can
I
have
me
gun
back,
please?
What
am
I
gonna
do,
Ken?
-
What
am
I
gonna
do?
Keep
on
moving.
Try
not
to
think
about
it.
Learn
a
new
language,
maybe?
Sure,
I
can
hardly
do
English.
That's
one
thing
You
don't
have
to
learn
Just
forget
about
home
for
a
while.
See
how
the
land
lies
Seven
years
is
not
that
long.
It's
longer
than
that
boy

Me

job.
Great
hitman
I
turned
out
to
be.
Some
people

Harry.
Just
tell
him
I'll
have
probably
You
won't,
will
you,
Ray?
Harry?
It's
Ken.
Listen
to
this
noise.
Do
you
know
what
that
is?
Yeah,
I
know
you
know
it's
a
train.
Well,
it's
a
train
that
Ray
just
and
he
doesn't
know
where
he's
going
So
if
you
need
to
do
your
worst,
You've
got
the
address
of
the
hotel.
Because
I've
got
to
quite
It's
like
a
fucking

Harry.
Harry!
What?
It's
an
inanimate
fucking
object.
You're
an
inanimate

for
your
mummy
'Cause
Daddy's

Where
are
you
going?
I've
got
to
go
to
Bruges.
Bruges?
Where's
that?
It's
in
Belgium.
Why
would
anybody
'Cause
I've
got
to
Is
it
something
It's
something
to
do
with
Ken.
It's
a
matter
of
honor.
Well,
it
ain't
gonna
Well,
of
course
it's
gonna
be
dangerous
You
are
bringing
the
fellas
with
you?
Tell
me
you're
bringing
Harry.
I'm
sorry
for
calling
you
I
was
upset.

You're
Irish?
What
is
your
name?
Derek
Perlurrl.
You
hit
the
Canadian.
You
hit
the
Canadian.
I
'heet'
the
Canadian?
That's
him!
You
hit
the
Canadian,
yeah?
Canadian?
Shit.

-
We're
taking
you
back
to
Bruges.
Aye
aye.
YURI:
Take
your
pick,
Mr.
Waters.

An
Uzi?
I'm
not
from
South
Central
I
didn't
come
here
to
shoot
20
black
I
want
a
normal
gun
I
knew
he
wouldn't
kill
the
guy.
I
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
when
I
was
-
About
the
what?
The
alcoves
in
the
Oh,
I
also
have
some
dumdums.
You
use
this
word,'dumdums'?
Dumdums,
yeah.
Would
you
like
some
I
know
I
shouldn't,
but
I
will.
Motherfucker.
Is
he
talking
to
me?
No,
Eirik's
on
your
side,
Your
young
friend
Ray
did?
I
was
trying
to
rob
him
And
the
gun
and
he
shot
the
blank
And
now,
I
cannot
see
from
this
eye
Well,
to
be
honest,
it
sounds
like
What?
I
mean,
basically,
if
you're
robbing
and
you
allow
your
gun
and
you
allow
yourself
to
be
shot
for
which
I
assume
the
person
has
to
get
yeah,
really,
it's
all
your
fault
So
why
don't
you
stop
whingeing
YURI:
Eirik,
I
really
wouldn't
respond.
I
thought
you
wanted
the
guy
dead?
I
do
want
the
guy
dead.
But
it
don't
change
the
fact
Does
it?
Thanks
for
the
gun,
Yuri.
Well?
The
boy
is
suicidal,
Harry.
He's
a
walking
dead
man.
Keeps
going
on
When
I
phoned
you
'Ken,
will
you
do
me
a
favor
and
No.
What
I
think
I
asked
you
was,
'He's
suicidal'?
I'm
suicidal.
You're
suicidal.
We
don't
all
keep
Has
he
killed
himself
yet?
He
put
a
loaded
gun
to
his
head
this
morning.
He...
What?
We
were
down
in
the
park...
Let
me
get
this
right.
What's
that
got
to
do
Let
me
get
this
right.
Not
only
you've
even
stopped
the
boy
which
would
have
which
would
have
which
sounds
like
It
wouldn't
have
Ken,
if
I
had
killed
a
little
kid,
I
wouldn't
have
thought
twice.
I'd
have
killed
myself
on
the
I'd
have
stuck
the
gun
in
me
mouth
That's
you,
Harry.
The
boy
has
the
capacity
to
do
Excuse
me,
Ken.
Yeah,
you
do.
You've
the
capacity
Yeah,
now
I'm
Harry,
let's
face
it.
And
I'm
not
being
funny,
but
you're
a
cunt.
You're
a
cunt
now,
And
the
only
thing
that's
Maybe
have
some
Leave
my
kids
fucking
out
of
it.
You
fucking
retract
that
bit
I
retract
that
bit
about
Insulting
my
fucking
kids!
I
retracted
it,
didn't
I?
Still
leaves
you
being
a
cunt.
Yeah,
I
fucking
got
that.
Where's
Ray
now?
Oh,
right
about
now,
of
the
one
million
towns
in

I'll
get
all
the
money
It's
not
a
problem,
And
I'll
get
all
your
acid
and
English
humor!
I'm
assuming
you've

of

To

Be

Anyway,

Are
you
going
to
turn
up?
Don't
know.
What

I
got
to
The
most
beautiful
woman
you've
ever
seen
in
all
of
your
stupid
life.
The

closed
this
evening.
No
way.
It's

The

Yesterday
an

Today
the

Here,
cranky,
here's

for
you.
The

is
closed

evening.
Understand,
Englishman?


Jimmy,
I've
been
wanting
to
say
I'm
really
sorry
for
That
was
way
out
of
order.
You
know,
Ray,
I'd
find
it
easier
if
the
two
of
you
weren't

It's
for
the
goddamn
movie,
man.
It
is
a
nice
town,
Harry.
I'm
glad
I
got
to
see
it.
I
didn't
mean
to
be
taking
the
It
is
a
fairytale
place.
-
It
really
is.
It's
just
a
shame
But
then
you
figure
if
it
wasn't
there'd
be
too
many
people
coming
to
Well,
I'm
glad
I
got
to
see
it
before
I
died.
What
are
you
doing?
What
are
you
fucking
doing?
I'm
not
fighting
anymore,
Harry.
All
right,
then
I'm
blowing
Don't
come
over
all
Gandhi.
Ken,
stop
messing
about,
please.
Pick
up
your
gun.
I
know
I'm
going
'cause
you're
a
spaz,
but...
I'm
totally
in
your
debt.
The
things
that
have
I
love
you
unreservedly
What?
For
your
integrity.
For
your
honor.
I
love
you.
The
boy
had
to
be
let
go.
The
boy
had
to
be
given
a
chance.
And
if
to
do
that,
I
had
to
say,
'and
fuck
everything
that's
gone
on
But
I'm
not
fighting
