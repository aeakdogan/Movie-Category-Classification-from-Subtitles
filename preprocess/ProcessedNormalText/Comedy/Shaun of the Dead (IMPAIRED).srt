orders,
please.

Shaun.
-
Do
you
see
what
I'm
saying?
I
know
he's
your
best
friend
I
know...
It's
not
that
I
don't
like
Ed.
It's
all
right.
-
lt'd
just
be
nice
if
we
could...
-..spend
a
bit
more
time
together.
-
Just
the
two
of
us.
With
Ed
here,
it's
no
wonder
and
that
only
exacerbates
things.
-
What
do
you
mean?
No,
what
does
"exacerbate"
mean?
It
means
to
make
things
worse.
Right,
right.
Well,
I
mean,
it's
not
that
-
Guys,
it's
not
that
I
don't
like
you.
And
I
do
want
to
spend
time
with
you.
It's
just
Ed
doesn't
have
too
many
friends.
Can
I
get
any
of
you
cunts
a
drink?
Anybody?

No,
thank
you.
I
know...
friends
are
important
to
Shaun
but
you
must
set
some
Daffs
is
always
taking
me
and
I'm
always
dragging
him
to
the
theatre.
-
I'm
not
so
hot
on
theatre.
-
It's
your
anniversary
soon.
-
Did
you
do
anything
special?

Shaun.
Hog
lumps.
Shaun,
what
I'm
trying
to
say
is
more
than
spending
every
night
I
want
to
do
more
interesting
stuff.
-
I
want
you
to
want
to
want
to
do
it.
Listen
to
me.
-
Not
that
I'd
know.
-
Not
yet.
-
It's
not
her...
-
No,
I
love
my
mum.
-
#
She's
like
butter
#
-
Shaun!
I
understand
what
We
should
get
out
there.
I'll
book
a
restaurant.
Just
the
two
of
us.
Things
will
change.
I
promise.
Really,
Shaun?

Time,
gentlemen.

'Player

entered

Haven't
you
got
work?
'Player
two
has
left
the
game.'

The
front
door
was
open
again
last
night.
-
I'm
not
saying
it
was
you.
-
I'm
saying
it
was
Ed.
I
can't
live
like
this.
Look
at
the
state
of
it.
-
Pete...
-
He
brings
a
bit.
He
sells
a
bit
of
weed
now
and
again.
Yeah,
once.
At
college.
To
you.
I've
known
him
since
primary
school.
Because
he
can
-
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
I
admit,
he
can
be
pretty
funny
on
occasion.
Like
that
time
we
stayed
up
all
night
drinking
-
When
was
that?
When's
he
going
home?
Hey,
man,
listen...
Top
left.
-
Uh-huh.
-
I'm
on
it.
-
Thanks.
2
seconds.
-
All
right,
Noodle?
-
No,
man.
-
I
ain't
got
nothing.
I've
only
got
an
'enry
meself.
-
Listen...
since
you're
not
working
at
the
moment
And
if
you
play
the
answer
machine,
-
Yep.

Writing
something
-
Nope.
-

Come
on,
it
was
pretty
funny.
-
Will
you
do
what
he
said?
Do
it
for
me,
then.
I'm
sorry,
Shaun.
-
It's
all
right.
I'm
sorry,
Shaun.
Oh!
Oh,
my
God,
that's
rotten.
-
I'll
stop
doing
'em
when
you
stop
laughing.
-
Get
that.


'Shaun,
it's
me.
'so
can
you
book
the
table
'I'll
try
you
at

Bye,

Hey!
You're
dead.

Nelson?
Hello,
my
friend.
No
beer
today?
No,
it's
a
bit
early
for
me.

Gather
round,
everyone.
Gather
round.
As
well
as
Mr
Sloman
being
off
today
I'm
afraid
Ash
is
feeling
so
I
will

So
if
we
can
all
pull
together...
-
Hello?
Hello,
mate.
I
was
totally
munted
last
night.
Yeah,
I
spoke
to
him.
He's
only
got
Henry.
All
right,

Continue.
Erm,

always
says,
In...
There's

It's

All

on,

How
old
are
you?
20?
21?.
Hey,
well...
I
know
you
don't
wanna
be

forever.
When?
You

Hello,

It's

He's

he's
my

Philip.
Shaun.
You
haven't
forgotten
about
tomorrow?
-
No.
No,
I
haven't
forgotten.
You
could
bring
the
flowers
I
was
gonna.
And
not
a
cheap
posy
I
wasn't
gonna.
Well,
we
look
forward
to
OK.
You've
got
red
on
you.
-
I
thought
it
wasn't
a
social
gathering?
How
comes
you're
allowed
to

He's

Just

Goodbye,

Liz
from

Sir?
Sir?
Sorry.
Erm,
they're
for
my

Mum.
"To
a
wonderful
Mum"
-
Er...the
first
one.

'..
London
seems

-
Oh,
my
God!
Shaun!
Oooh!
How
are
you
doing?
-
Surviving.
-
Yeah,
are
you?
-
Bought?
-
Are
you
still
with...?
That's
great.
Glad
somebody
made
it.
-
Er,
it's
3
years
ago
last
week.
-
We're
going
out
for
a
meal
tonight.
Yeah...
Come
on!
-
Are
you
gonna
thank
me,
then?
Tidying
up.
-
It
doesn't
look
tidy.
'Hello,
Fulci's.
Can
you
hold,
please?'
-
Do
you
want
your
messages?
Your
mum
rang
about
tomorrow
night.
Liz
rang
about
the
two
of
you
Then
your
mum
rang
back
to
see
-
'Hello,
Fulci's.'
but
could
you
possibly
do
me
'Sorry,
we
just
gave
away
the
last
table.'
Wasn't
true
about
your
mum.
Where
are
we
gonna
go?
-
The
Winchester.
-
There's
a
Breville
out
back.
-

-

'Hello,
it's
me.'
'What's
the
plan,
then?'
Erm,
there's
been
a
bit
of
a...
-
'What
do
you
mean?'
'But...I
thought
you
said
it
was
all
OK?'
Yeah.
'You
didn't
book
it,
did
you,
Shaun?'
-
No.
-
The
Winchester?
-
'Hello?'
-
'I'm
not
sure,
Shaun.'

'Lizzie
doesn't
want
to
see
you.'
-
Just
open
the
door!
Do
you
want
me
to
climb
up
the
wall,
'You're
not
coming
in.'
-
OK,
see
you
in
a
minute.


'Hi,
it's
me
again.'
Can
we
just
talk
about
this?
Let's
go
out.
-
To
the
Winchester?
-
No,
I
don't
fucking
want
to!
It's
not
the
only
place
in
the
world.
We'll
go
to
the
Shepherd's,
-
I'm
going
out
with
David
and
Di.
You
hang
out
with
my
friends?
That's
harsh.
Let's
just
go
somewhere
and
have
a
laugh.
You
promised
you'd
stop
smoking.
You
promised
you'd
try
drinking
-
You
promised
we'd
go
on
holiday.
-
We
met
in
Greece.
It's
not
the
same.
-
You
promised
us
free
cable.
I
can
give
up
smoking
whenever
I
want.
W-What
was
the
next
one?
It's
not
enough,
Shaun.

'We
appear
to
have
'lf
you
or
someone
you
know
may...'
I'd
say
your
9
lives
were
up,
Shaun.
Get
fucked,
4-eyes!
You
go
out
with
her,
you
love
her
so
much.
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
'..the
devastation
really
is
extensive.
I
don't
know
what
he
meant
by
that.
Got
you
these.
-
"To
a
wonderful
mum"?
Yeah,
that's
because...
I
thought
it
would
be
funny
about
you
don't
want
to
be
It's
just
a
little
joke,
-
They're
for
your
mum,
aren't
they?
Smooth.
If
I
don't
do
something,
I'll
end
up
in
that
pub
for
the
rest
of
my
life
wondering
what
the
hell
happened.
What
do
you
mean
do
something?

Fuck
her.
You
got
your
pint.
You
got
your
pig
snacks.
Oh.
You
want
your
favourite
monkey?
Shall
I
do
Clyde?
See,
I
knew
you'd
get
over
her.

#
If
you
leave
me
now...

Who
the
hell
put
this
on?
It's
on
random.
For
fuck's
sake.
John,
yes
please,
mate.
You
know
what
we
should
do
tomorrow?
A
Bloody
Mary
first
thing,
a
bite
at
the
King's
Head,
stagger
back
here
and
bang...
How's
that
for
a
slice
of
fried
gold?
-
No.
Talk
to
me.
She
said
if
she
stayed
with
me
Iike
these
sad
old
fuckers
That
is
harsh.

These
are
rich,
interesting
characters.

women.

about

maniac.
She's

ex-porn
star.

say
she
starred
in
Cafe
Au
Lait...

Pour
Vous.
Yeah.
What
about
John,
then?
-
He's
North
London
Mafia.
It's
true,
Big
Al
says
so.
Yeah,
Big
Al
also
says

you
don't
need
Liz
to
have
a
good
time.
-
Don't,
man.
Oi,
look
at
me.
Can
I
just
say
one
thing?
I'm
not
gonna
I'm
not
gonna
say
if
you
love
her
let
her
go
and
I'm
not
gonna
bombard
you
with
clichs

not
the
end
of
the
world.

Sorry,
we're
closed.

What
was

Nothing.

What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
You
wanna
live

alone!

ever
does

way

One
of

bit
me.

didn't

to
ask
them!

got

headache
And
the

open.

So,
what's
the
plan?
Right.
'We
take
Pete's
car,
we
drive
over
to
Mum's,
'we
go
in,
we
take
care
of
Philip.'
I'm
so
sorry,
Philip.
'Then
we
grab
Mum,
go
over
to
Liz's
place,
'hole
up,
have
a
cup
of
tea
'and
wait
for
all
this
to
blow
over.'
-
Why
have
we
got
to
go
to
Liz's?
-
She
dumped
you.
-
Why?
All
right,
gay.
-
I'm
not
staying
there,
though.
If
we
hole
up,
I
wanna
know
where
the
exits
are
OK...
'Take
Pete's
car,
go
round
Mum's,
'go
in,
deal
with
Philip.'
Sorry,
Philip.
'Grab
mum,
go
to
Liz's,
'have
a
cup
of
tea
Perfik.
No,
wait,
we
can't
bring
them
back
here.
-
Why
not?
Yeah.
Look
at
the
state
of
it.
Where's
safe?
Where's
familiar?
Where
can
I
smoke?
'Take
car,
go
to
Mum's,
kill
Phil.'
-
Sorry.
'have
a
nice
cold
pint
How's
that
for
a
slice
of
fried
gold?
Yeah,
boy!

recap,

you
believe
everything
you
hear
on
TV?
Yeah,
I
can
see
it,
it's
just
outside.
Any
zombies
out
there?
-
Don't
say
that.
-
That.
That.
The
Z
word.
Don't
say
it.
-
Why
not?
All
right.
Are
there
any
out
there,
though?
Can't
see
any.
Oh!
No,
there
they
are.
-
OK,
let's
do
this,
yeah?
Yeah!
I
got
to
do
a
wee
first.
Ooh...can
I
drive?
What?
I
always
wanted
to
drive
Pete's
car.
OK.
Ahh!
Oh,
God.
Sorry,
Pete.
Listen,
we're
gonna
Erm,
we'll
bring
it
back.
And
if
you're
feeling
better
later,
You're
more
than
welcome
to,
er...
join
us.
Pete'd
be
so
pissed
off
I
don't
think
so.
Shaun,

button's

Oh,
cock
it!
Get
lost!
Drive.

What
are
you
doing?
Ed,
look
out!
I
think
we
hit
something.
-
Or
someone.
Ow!
Are
you
all
right?
Come
on,
let's
just

Oh,

Ah,

Who's
a

then?
You
didn't
say
Barbara
had
a
Jag.
It's
Philip's.
He
won't
let
anybody
near
it.
I
put
a

Bar
in
it
once

Fuck,
it's
gorgeous.
Why
don't
I
stay
here?

You
know,
just

Yes,

about

-

won't
want
to

Put
the

on
and
I'll

with

you

What
have
you
got
there?

I
hope.
-
No,

that

Shaun?

took

all
to

wants
to
take
us
somewhere.

you
should
stay
here

said
he
wasn't

I'm
not
going
anywhere
without
Philip.

Mum,
how
much
do
you
love
Philip?
-
2
sugars,
is
it?
Oh,
yes.
Will
you
cut
me
some
bread,
love?
Mum,
look,
how
much
do
you
love
Philip?
Do
we
have
to
go
through
all
that
again?
What
would
you
say
if
I
told
you
You
weren't
easy
to
live
with.
-
He
chased
me
with
a
bit
of
wood!
-
Did
he
tell
you
that?
Motherfucker.
Sorry,
Mother...
Mum!
Did
you
know
that
on
several
occasions...
That
wasn't
true.
-
You
don't
understand...
Philip
is
my
husband
and
I
would
at
least
expect
you
You
must
be
more
adult
about
these
things.

Yeah.
Come
on,
Shaun.
you
just...
gotta
be
a
man.

I'm
telling
you,
it's
a
fuss
over
nothing.
-

-
Hi,
Barbara.
You
better
believe
it.
-
It
wasn't
as
easy
as
all
that.
No,
it's
probably
best
if
we...
Hmm...I
pranged
it.
You
were
parked.
Yeah.
I
guess
we'll
have
to
take
the
Jag.
-
Philip?
Look
out!

Christ!
-
Give
me
the
car
keys!
Give
me
the
car
keys!
I'm
on
it.
Don't
worry
about
me.
-
Maybe
I
should
drive.
Just
be
careful!

Can
you
please
turn
that
noise
down?

Are
you
all
right,
dear?
I'd
be
fine
if
it
weren't
for
that
bloody
racket.
-
It
is
a
bit
loud.
You
do
realise
this
is
Oh,
yeah.

-
Here.
-
Have
you
still
got
the
child
locks
on?
You
can't...
Hey,
man,
watch
the
leather.
Keep
moving.
If
there's
any
problems...
I'll
do
the
honks.


'Hello?'
Hello?


-
Guys,
can
you
let
me
in?
I've
come
to
get
you.
-
What
are
you
doing?
-
We
were
safe!
There
was
2
of
them
out
there.
-
Lots.
It
only
takes
one
of
them
I
tried
calling
but
I
couldn't
get
through.
-
Oh,
you
made
a
plan?
If
we
don't,
they'll
tear
us
to
pieces.
And
that
will
exacerbate
things
for
all
of
us.
-
Shaun...
This
is
about
survival.
We
need
to
be
somewhere
more
secure,
-
We're
with
you,
Shaun.
-
We're
with
you.
Daffs!
I
don't
want
to
be
torn
to
pieces
-
I'm
not
going
if
Lizzie's
not
going.
-
I'm
not
staying
by
myself.
-
Lizzie?
-
All
right,
Flash,
what's
your
plan?
but
it's
gonna
be
a
bit
cramped
now.
-
Yes!
Oh,
no.
Well,
I've
passed
my
test.
David?
I
don't
see
the
point
Look,
just
get
any
blunt
objects
together.
If
you
get
cornered,
Keep
together,
stay
sharp
and
follow
me.
So,
what's
the
plan,
then?
We're
going
to
the
Winchester.
OK?
Let's
go.
-
Come
on.

What's
up,
niggaz?
Apologies
for
the
cramped
conditions.
Philip,
hang
in
there,
OK?
And,
Mum,
this
is
Liz.
Liz,
Mum.

Hello.
(#
80s
Matchbox
B-Line
Disaster:
Ed,
be
careful.
-
Is
your
dad
all
right?
-
He's
bleeding.
Thought
you
wanted
to
get
there
fast?
I
want
to
get
there
in
one
piece!
Chill
out,
it's
a
short
cut.
-
That
road
goes
to
the
Winchester.
-
Liz,
please!
-
It's
a
pub,
it's
safe,
it's
secure.
-
What
makes
it
so
secure?
And
there's
a
rifle
above
the
bar.
-
I
would
think
that's
deactivated.
Big
Al
also
says
dogs
can't
look
up.
-
They
can't.
-
Of
course
they
can!
Yes!
The
pub
is
the
right
place
to
go.
-
Shaun...
-

-
Being
a
father,
it's
not
easy.
You
were
12
when
I
met
you,
I
just
wanted
you
to
be
strong
-
Philip,
you
don't
have
to
explain.
And
I
always
thought
You
just
need...m-motivation.
Somebody
to
look
up
to
and...
I
thought
it
could
be
me.
Would
you
just...take
care
of
your
mum?
There's
a
good
boy.
-
Ed,
can
you
pull
over?
-
Ah!
Ed,
please
pull
over.
-
Just
pull
over!
Whoa,
momma!
-
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Stop
telling
me
to
chill
out!
-
And
everybody
is
not
all
right.
Mum,
it's
Philip,
he's
gone.
-
Where's
he
gone?
No,
he
isn't.
Get
out!
Jesus!
-
Get
it
open!

Quick!

-
The
child
lock!
-
Now
what?
-

How
do
we
get
Philip
out
the
car?
-
We
can't
leave
your
dad.
Mum,
he
was,
but
he's
not
any
more.
-
I
really
think
we
could...
It
looks
like
him
but
there
is
nothing

Let's
go,
shall
we?
You're
not
suggesting
we
walk?
-
Everybody
OK?
Maybe
we
should
all
hold
hands,
Do
you
know
where
we're
going?
-
David,
come
on.
-
Do
you,
though?
Are
we
close?
We're
pretty
close.
-
Is
your
mum
gonna
be
OK?
-
Did
you
contact
your
folks?
-
Do
you
think
this
is
happening
there?
About
last
night.
-
You
said
this
wasn't
about
us.
-
You
said
it
was
about
survival.
You're
not
just
trying
to
prove
something?

-
Maybe
this
isn't
the
best
time
to
talk.
Shaun.
Yvonne.
-
How's
it
going?
Hey,
Liz.
Long
time
no
see.
Hey,
Yvonne.
Erm...this
is
my
boyfriend,
Declan.
Erm...my
friends
Mark,
Maggie,
-
my
mum
and
my
cousin
Tom.
This
is
Shaun
and
his
girlfriend
Liz.
-
They've
split
up,
actually.
-
Yeah.
We
should
scoot.
-
Yeah,
we're
going
to
the
Winchester.
-
Yeah.

Hi.

Hello.
Hi.

Hello.

All
right.
See?
The
Winchester's
just
over
there.
-
Over
where?
Just
over
there,
over
the
20
garden
fences?
What's
the
matter,
David?
Never
taken
a
short
cut
before?
Shaun.
I'm
sure
Jill
and
Derek
live
round
here.
Now,
the
Winchester
Everyone
stay
where
they
are,
I'll...
-
1,
2,
3,
4,
5.
Yes.
-

I'm
coming!
Mum,
are
you
OK?
Are
you
OK?
I
don't
think
Jill
and
Derek
do
live
here.
Shaun?
Are
you
all
right?

What
are
you
doing?
Shaun!
Yes!
No,
that's
rubbish.
-
Ooh!
Feel
free
to
step
in
any
time.
-
You
did
all
right.
I'm
so
sorry
about
that.
Right.
OK,
everyone
stay
where
they
are.
-
Is
it
clear?
-
How
many?
Oh,
well,
that
is
just
great.
There
are
a
fair
few
of
them,
yes.
I
trust
Shaun
has
another
genius
scheme
This
is
hardly
constructive,
David!
-
We
should
have
stayed
at
the
flat.
Because...
Because,
because
of...
-
Will
you
stop
it?

Right,
let's
all
shake
out.
Or
not.
Take
another
look
at
the
way
he
moves.
Almost
like
sleepwalking.
Look
at
the
face,
Like
a
drunk
who's
lost
a
bet.
OK,
let's
try,
shall
we?
Liz.

Nice.
Good
vocal
work.
Sorry,
dear,
I
was
miles
away.
-
D-Daffs.
-
Come
on!
It's
mournful,
sorrowful,
Uuurgh.
-
Much
better.
Ed.
This
is
the
night!
-
What
is
that?
Who
died
and
made
you
Don't...

Yeah,
that's
pretty
good.
Right,
let's
all
try
together,
shall
we?
Go,
go,
go,
go.
Shit!
Get
round
me,
get
round
me!
John?
John,
Bernie,
are
you
there?
-
They
can
hear
you.
-
They
know.
-
I
can't
see
them.
-
Break
the
window.
-
Break
the
window!
-
Yeah,
there's...
2
seconds.
Hey,
Noodle.
-
'All
right?'
-
'You
get
anything
yet?'
I'm
in
the
middle
of
something.
-
Oi!
What
are
you
doing?
-
Fuck
off.
Fuck
fucking
off!.
I've
spent
an
entire
life...
Look
at
me.
I've
spent
my
entire
life
and
all
you
ever
do
is
fuck
things
up
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
do
it
any
more.
Shaun.
Oh.
You
were
saying
about
another
way
in?
Yeah,
there's
a...
What
are
you
doing?
-

No!
No,
they'll
follow
us.
-
What
do
you
mean
do
something?
Come
on,
that's
it.
Over
here!
Come
on.
Oh,
bollocks.
-
Wait
till
I've
gone
then
get
inside.
I
won't
be
long,
I
promise.
Come
on,
Come
on,
this
way,
that's
it!
Come
on.
This
way,
follow
me.
Come
and
get
it.
It's
a
running
buffet.
All
you
can
eat!
Shall
we
go
in,
then?
-
Come
on,
Barbara.
Leave
those.
-
He's
been
gone
a
good
20
minutes.
Either
way,
we
need
to
think
about
blocking
-
How
will
Shaun
get
back
in?
-
Let's
get
some
lights
on.
-
Power's
off.
-
We
mustn't
advertise
our
whereabouts.
-
Do
we,
David?
I'm
just
being
proactive.
There's
no
lights,
no
power.
-
You
did
that,
you
twat.
We
were
in
a
spot
of
bother.
Somebody
and
if
none
of
you
are
prepared
then
perhaps...I
should.
-
Will
Shaun
be
gone
long?
-
How
do
you
know?
Wouldn't
he?
How
can
you
trust
a
man
A
man
whose
idea
of
a
romantic
nightspot
This
is
a
pub!
We
are
in
a
pub!
I
could
get
a
round
in.
Let's
just
wait
for
Shaun.
We'll
barricade
What
then?
How
long?
-
What
are
we
going
to
eat?
-
There's
a
Breville
out
back.
Must
be
why
Shaun
took
us
here
-
He's
coming
back!
If
he
does,
do
you
think
his
master
plan
Is
he
just
gonna
stroll
in
I
don't
know,
David!
But
what
I
do
know
is
that
we're
here
now
-
Ed,
get
me
a
double
vodka.
I'll
have
a
drink
too.
-
Hello.
We'll
have
a
party
We've
got
our
nibbles.
-
David!
Pickle!
Hello,
Mum.
You
all
right?
-
Everybody
OK?
-
Any
sign
of
John
and
Bernie?
-
Check
upstairs?
-
Phones?
-
OK...
Yeah,
well,
I
promised,
didn't
l?
How
did
you
lose
them?
I
just
gave
them
the
slip.
-
Well,
how
did
you
get
in?
I
tried
to
tell
you
But
it
wasn't
me
blowing
our
cover
-
He's
not
my
boyfriend.
Thanks,
babe.
So,
what's
the
plan,
then?
Would
anyone
like
a
peanut?
Why
don't
you
do
your
Clyde?
Has
anyone
seen
Ed
does
the
most
amazing
-
No,
it's
not.
-
No,
no.
-
You've
built
it
up
too
much.
Everyone
wants
to
see
it.
Do
it,
do
it,
do
it,
do
it.
Come
on,
do
it.
I'm
not
a
performing
monkey.
-
The
power's
on.
The
streetlights
are
on.
-
What
about
the
lights?
The
lights
are
on
a
separate
circuit.
It's
quite
simple,
David.
-
Is
that
it?

Liz,
erm...have
you
got
a
quid?
Erm...
Yeah.
Never
anything
on,
is
there?
What?
-
I
think
we
might
have
a
bit
of
a
problem.
-
They
followed
me.
Yeah.

Well,
we'll
just
have
to
be
What?

Ed,
no!
Turn
it
off!.


Shit!
-
Where
the
hell
did
he
come
from?

-
Who
put
this
on?
Dianne,
get
Mum
somewhere
safe.
-
What?!
-
Liz,
Ed,
grab
a
weapon.
-
Cocktails?
The
flaming
spirits
-
But
the
whole
place
could
go
up.
How
about

Cos
I'm
having...
#
#
I'm
a
shooting
star
#
Defying
the
laws
of
gravity
#
I'm
a
racing
car
passing
by
#
I'm
gonna
go,
go,
go
#
There's
no
stopping
me
#
I'm
burning
through
the
sky...
-
I
can't
find
the
switches!
#
That's
why
they
call
me
Mister
Fahrenheit
#
I'm
travelling
at
the
speed
of
light
#
I
wanna
make
#
Don't
stop
me
now
#
I'm
having
such
a
good
time
#
I'm
having
a
ball
#
Don't

If

Just

#
Don't

#
Don't

#
Yes
I'm
having
a
good
time
-
#
I'm
a
rocket
ship
on
my
way
to
Mars...
-
We
have
a
situation!
-
Fuck
this.
2
seconds.

Oi!
#
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
explode
#
I'm
burning
through
the
sky,
yeah...
Shaun!
#..call
me
Mister
Fahrenheit...
No!
Yes!
Yes!
In
the
head!
Ooow!
Shauny!
#
Don't
stop
me
#
Don't
stop
me,
don't
stop
me
#
Don't
stop
me...
#
Why
didn't
you
just
shoot
him,
man?
Ed,
for
the
last
time,
it's...
I
fucking
knew
it!
OK.
But
dogs
can
look
up.
-
Has
anyone
fired
a
gun
before?
-
Apart
from
Ed?
-
Apart
from
David
and
Ed?
-
He
shot
his
sister
in
the
leg.
-
We
should
all
do
it.
-
No
one
has
any
experience.
We've
got...
-
29
bullets.
29
shells.
I
need
someone
everyone
else
to
look
out.
I
will
fire.
As
Bertrand
Russell
said
the
only
thing
I
think
we
can
all
appreciate
that
now.
-
Was
that
on
a
beer
mat?
-
I
won't
say
anything.

-
They
want
to
come
in.
David,
Dianne,
let's
go.
-
Barbara.
-
Would
you
like
to
come
with
me?
It's
nice
to
meet
you,
finally.
-
Really?
-
Ah!
Are
you
all
right?
I've
got
something
for
you.
Shaun's
father
gave
me
this.
-
I'd
like
you
to
have
it.
It
seems
only
right.
I
didn't
want
to
say
anything.
I
thought
Shaun
would
be
worried.
Liz!
Here
they
come!
-
Stay
behind
me!
Sorry,
we're
closed!
-
The
safety!
Cock
it!
-
There!
3
o'clock!
-
Oh!
Over
there
again.
Quarter
to
12.
-
11:45!
Top
left!
-
Reload.
Come
on,
come
on.
Nice
shot.
OK,
David,
Dianne,
Ed,
take
over
a
sec.
-
What
is
it?
What's
wrong?
-
Mum,
what's
wrong?
-
Mum,
I
don't
understand.
I
didn't
want
to
say
anything,
No,
you
should've
said.
-
Take
over
a
sec.
-
What's
up?
-
Barbara's
hurt!

Jesus.

I
know
first
aid.
Just
hang
on.
Mum!
-
Mum.
Just
hold
on,
Mum,
you're
gonna
be
fine.
-
I
never
thanked
you.
For
these.
"To
a
wonderful
mum."
It's
been
a
funny
sort
of
day,
hasn't
it?
Oh,
no,
no!
Mum,
come
on.
Stop
it,
stop
it,
stop
it.

Mum.
Please
don't
go.

-
What
are
you
doing?
-
Daffs!
-
She's
gonna
come
back!
-
She'll
change.
-
She's
a
zombie.
Move
aside.
I'm
gonna
count
to
3.
1...
2...
3!
-
Don't
point
that
gun
at
my
mum!
Don't
point
that
gun
at
Barbara!
-
Ed,
don't
exacerbate
things!
-
This
isn't
exactly
fair.
-
Thank
you.
Please,
can
we
just
stop
Tell
him
to
put
the
gun
down!
She's
gonna
change.
You
know
I'm
right.
And
when
she
does,
she'll
kill
all
of
us.
That's
what
this
is
about,
isn't
it?
He's
always
hated
me
-
She's
not...
-
What?
-
That
is
not
true.
-
That
is
not
true.
-
What?
to
get
close
to
Liz
and
when
she
knocked
I've
come
to
terms
with
that,
Daffs,
Lizzie,
I
want
you
to
know
David!
There
are
slightly
more
-
Like
"Daffs"
pointing
a
gun
at
my
mum.
-
Christ,
she's
not
dead!
For
a
hero,
you're
quite
a
hypocrite.
You've
gone
from
I'm
not
a
chartered
accountant.
-
Well,
you
look
like
one.
-
I'm
a
lecturer.
She's
not
your
mum.
-
Don't
say
that.
Please
can
we
just
calm
the
fuck
down!
Now,
I
can
see
what
David
is
trying
to
say...
-
Thank
you.
Yep.
And,
Shaun...
Shaun,
look
at
me.
I
can't
begin
to
imagine
but
we
can't
afford
to
fall
apart.
Shaun,
babe...
I
know
you
don't
wanna
hear
this...
You
do
it.
I'm
sorry,
Mum.
Do
it!
Well...I
think
we're
all
agreed,
David,
no!
David!
-
Right,
I'm
leaving.
-
I'm
not
staying
here.
-
I
think
you
should
go.
-
What
do
you
mean
"we"?
Opening
that
door
now
-
You
gonna
stay
here
with
him?
-
After
where
he
led
us?
Shaun
didn't
ask
you
to
come
here.
-
Get
away
from
that
door
this
instant!
David!
I'm
so
sorry,
Dianne.
Maybe
I'm
not
the
one
Shaun...

David!
No!
No!
No!
No!
David!
-
No!
No!
David!
Dianne,
no!
I'm
coming,
David!
David!
Oh
dear.
-
Cocktails?
Stay
back!
Shaun,
hold
them!
Heads!
-
Ed!
Shauny,
look
who
it
is.
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Ed!
-
Shaun!
Don't
groan
at
me,
you
thick
fuck!
I
can't
hold
them!
No!
-
Shaun!
I
said
leave
him
alone!
Ed.
Ed!
Shaun,
bar!
Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
What?
Chuck
us
a
cloth,
will
you?
-
Where
are
the
shells?
Oh,
fuck.
Ow!
Fuck
it!
What
are
we
gonna
do?
-
The
cellar.
-
There's
a
hatch
out
on
to
the
street.
Oh,
give
us
a
fucking
break!
Go!
I
can
see
the
street.
Come
on.
Come
on!
Why
won't
it
open?
That's
it
then,
we're
trapped.
Whose
fucking
idea
was
that?
Man,
I've
really
ballsed
this
up.
-
No,
you
haven't.
I
couldn't
save
Di
or
David.
You
shouldn't
feel
so
responsible,
you
tried.
Yeah,
I
suppose.

Do
you
think
they'll
get
through?
Yeah.
How
many
shells
have
we
got
left?
Erm...2.
I
suppose
we
could
take
a
few
of
them
out
I
wasn't
thinking
about
them.
I
know.
-
What
about
Ed?
There's
only
2
shells.
How
are
we
gonna
do
this?
I
don't
know.
Erm...
One
of
us
has
to
go
first.
One
should
do
the
other
You
should
do
me.
I
don't
think
I've
got
it
in
me
my
mum
and
my
girlfriend
What
makes
you
think
I've
taken
you
back?
Well...
you
don't
want
to
die
single,
do
you?

Actually...I
would
like
to
be
shot.
Besides,
I've
changed.
I
haven't
had
a
fag
He
hasn't.
Maybe
we
should
have
one
now.
-
You
left
them
in
my
flat.
-
I
was
desperate.
-
Sorry.
Come
on,
we're
getting
out
of
here.
-
I
might
just
stay
here.
-
You
two
should
make
a
go
of
it.
-
I
only
hold
you
back.
Maybe
you
should
have
this.
-
Don't
you
want
it?
I
can't
hit
anything
with
it
anyway,
-
Ed,
I'm
sorry.
-
Cos
I
was
shouting
at
you
earlier
on.
I'm
sorry
too.
It's
OK.
No...
I'm
sorry,
Shaun.
Oh,
God!
That's
not
funny.
-
I'll
stop
doing
'em
when
you
stop
laughing.
You'd
better
be
off.
Bye,
Ed.
Love
you.
Cheers.
I
love
you
too,
man.
Gay.

Ready?

One.
Ready.

Fire!
Oh,

How
are
you
doing?
They're
taking
us
somewhere
safe.
Is
it
just
the
two
of
you?
Well,
glad
somebody
made
it.
Come
on.
