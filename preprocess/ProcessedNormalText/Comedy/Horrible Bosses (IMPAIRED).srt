This

I'm
this
close
to
getting
a
big
promotion
I'll
be
right
there,
Mr.
Harken.
Then
all
the
endless
hours,
...will
have
been
worth
it.
HARKEN:
You're
a
punctual
guy.
You
know
Which
is
what
leads
me
to
think
that...
...there
must
be
something
wrong
May

been
a

late.
But
according
to
this,
you

now

If

the

I'm
gonna

Well,

lying.
No.
I--
Who

-Thomas.
I
gotta
let
him

Sorry.
I

Unfortunately,

So
I
had
to
find
a

Now,
I
always
admired

They're

So
I
went

I
became

-How
are
you
today,
Dale?

DALE:
Okay,
I
became
a

The
only
reason
I
took
one,
You
took
one
because
you
thought
I
was?
I
was
just
trying
to
be
polite.
So
if
I,
uh,

my
balls
...you'd
do
that
too?

would
not.

girlfriend
anymore.
-What?
You

Not

style.

Shut

chance
Right.
At

get
something
I'll
break
through
the
wall
of
the

...and
make
one
huge
enormous
office.
However,
I

Uh-oh.
-Will

little
ridiculous,
but--
Look,

But
the
last
thing
that

style.
They're
saying
my
hands
Four
stars
wrapped
around
your
stick,
-Nick
the
top,
nick
the
top,
pecker
spit.
Look
at
me.
I
know
what
I'm
doing
Hey!
Come
on,
man.
I
gotta
go.
But
listen,
...l'm
staying
at
my
mom's
house.
Mm.
For
an
extra
hundred,
l'll
let
you
...right
here
in
my
bellybutton.
I'll
be
at
my
mom's.
KURT:
Oh,
Kenny.
That
dude
banged
all
three
of
my
sisters.
He
might
be
looking
for
your
brother
now,
Maybe
don't
quit
your
job.
I
guess
we'll
be
miserable
NICK:
That's
the
way
it's
looking.
We
don't
have
many
options,
do
we?
Think
about
it,
we
can
quit
our
jobs
...or,
uh,
keep
our
jobs
...that
spend
their
entire
day
-You
do
that
too?
-Sounds
a
little
sick.
It's
not
like
we're
gonna
-Good.
...that
our
lives
would
be
a
lot
easier
NICK:
Hypothetically,
if
we
could
do
it
and
none
-No.
-No,
you
wouldn't.
-You
would?
It's
not
murder
if
it's
justified.
I
can't
wait
to
hear
this.
If
one
evil
person
dies
You
know,
Bobby
Pellit
is
an
absolute
If
he
has
his
way,
he's
gonna
end
up
What?
Technically,
l
think
it's
immoral
I
should
kill
Harken
for
not
letting
me
Yes.
Yes,
you
should.
But
l
don't
care
how
bad
our
bosses
are.
Julia
is
ruining
your
life,
you
know?
-That
is
wrong.
-Come
on,
she's
not
ruining
it.
You're
right.
I'm
gonna
go
to
Julia's
house,
...and
l'll
put
her
in
a
box
and
l'll
mail
it
I'm
done
with
this
conversation.
You're
You're
paying
I
was
just
speaking
hypothetically,
Me
too.
STACY:
Look,
l'm
really
kind
of
Not
in
the
mood
for
what?
-Hi.
Oh,
what
are
you
doing
here?
-l
invited
her.
And
she
said
that
now
that
we're
engaged,
-And
you
know
l
have
that
loose
filling.
This
really
was
so,
so
sweet
of
you,
Julia.
Oh,
please.
Come
on,
Stacy,
You're
part
of
the
family
now.

But,
um,
I
don't
know
Oh,
why
not?
Because
we're
mixing
pleasure
We're
taking
advantage
of
Julia.
Dale.
There's
nothing
that
you
could
do
ever
-Okay?
All
right,
you.
Let's
go
say

STACY:
Okay.
Fuck
me.
Ten.
Nine.
I
don't
know
-Okay.
Put
your
hand
in
a
safe
place
Oh,
there
she
goes.
JULlA:
Come
here!

You're
gonna
give
me
that
dong,
Dale.
My
dong?
You're
gonna
fuck
my
slutty
little
mouth.
Do
you
hear
the
words
you
say
sometimes?
Let's
have
sex
on
top
of
her.
Get
down,
get
down.
Hey,
hey!
Goddamn
you!
That's
it,
okay?
So
l'm
done,
Julia.
Fuck
this.
l'm
out.
l
don't
need
this
job.
I'm
gonna
tell
her
you
fucked
me.
What?
If
you
don't
fuck
me,
Okay.
Tell
her
whatever
the
hell
you
want.
She
already
knows
And
l
think
once
she
gets
a
look
...she's
gonna
believe
me.
-What
is
that?
When
I
changed
the
crown
Yeah.
Well,
l
just,
uh,
took
a
few
pictures
DALE:
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
no.
What?
JULlA:
You
did
all
this
Ooh.
Mm-hm.
Yep.

-Rape.
Rape.
That's
a
rape.
You're
a
raper
and
you've
raped
me.
Just
relax
there,
Jodie
Foster.
Your
dick
wasn't
even
hard.
That
does
not
give
me
any
relief.
But
it
will
be
next
time,
and
if
it
is
not...
...this
little
sweetheart
right
here
is
gonna
So
please
prep
the
patient
I'll
be
back
in
a
jiffy.
I'm
in.
Let's
kill
this
bitch!
NICK:
What
bitch?
Our
bosses
need
to
die.
You
were
right,
We
were
drinking
last
night.
I
know.
That
was
before
Julia
tried
to
fuck
KURT:
Really?
She's
gone
fucking
batshit
crazy.
-Where
are
they?
-lt's
a
whole
thing.
You
guys
in
or
out?
-Nick,
what
do
you
say?
Nick,
come
on.
Seriously.
l
mean,
uh,
what
about
-Gam
Gam.
She
didn't
get
to
say
goodbye
Because
his
dickbag
of
a
boss
-What
would
Gam
Gam
want
you
to
do?
Okay,
forget
about
Gam
Gam.
This
is
about
you,
Nick.
Well,
obviously
I
want
him
gone.
-Exactly.
So
let's
do
this.
KURT:
How
do
we
do
this?
Stacy
and
l,
we
watch
a
ton
of
Law
&
Order.
There's
all
sorts
of
ways
the
bad
They
leave
behind
skin
cells
Sperm.
-Most
of
the
time,
it's
sperm.
Anyway,
that's
not
the
point.
...we're
not
qualified.
-Are
you
talking
about
a
hit
man?
That's
a
really
good
idea.
Yeah.
We
don't
clean
-No,
we
pay
someone
to
do
that.
Well,
l
don't
actually.
Stacy
cuts
my
hair.
-She
does?
-She
have
training
for
that?
She
might.
And
where
are
you
Why
don't
you
guys
I
got
this
whole
thing
figured
out.
I'm
gonna
give
you
a
call
tomorrow,
Why
don't
you
just
tell
us
now?
I
don't
have
it
all
figured
out.
KURT:
Okay.
Okay.
All
right.
l'm
gonna
go
home
too.
-Well,
you
are.
This
is
your
house
here.
...in
and
out
of
my
fridge
-No,
no.
-Were
you
followed?
People
follow
people
in
these
types
Oh,
boy.
What
people?
Just
take
one
quick
look
around,
-Let's
put
this
down.
-Calm
down!
Shut
the
door,
take
the
chain
off
-l
pissed
him
off
already.
What
the
hell's
going
on,
huh?
I
don't
want
an
assassin
Don't
want
this
guy
knowing
Hang
on,
you
guys
already
went
ahead
-Oh,
bigtime.
-lt
was
easy.
Easy
as
buying
a
used
futon.
Yeah.
They
don't
write
"hit
man,"
They
use
code
words,
like
wet
work,
"Skilled
professional
...in
domestic
and
international
Discreet.
No
children,
That
last
part
was
important.
l
saw
that,

I
feel
we
should've
got
-20/20
hindsight.
KURT:
Oh,
shit.
KURT:
He
looks
like
James
Bond.
Bet
he
carries
a
gun
you
screw
together.
So
dangerous.
-Come
on.
He
charges
so
much
we
can't
-Kills
all
three
of
us?
Hold
on.
Could
that
happen?

-Gotta
let
him
in.
-What
do
you
mean?
Ready?


Are
you
Dale?
-l
am
the
one
they
call
Dale.
Please
come
in.
MAN:
Are
all
three
of
you
participating
in
this?
DALE:
Yes.
KURT:
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Very
well.
Now,
before
we
go
any
further...
...l
need
to
know
if
there
are
I
will
find
out
if
there
are.
I'm
sure
you
would,
but
there's
none
-That's
a
silly
move.
Then
let's
get
started.
-l
love
this
guy.
-His
voice,
you
kidding?
And
you
do
know
that
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
-For
the
mess.
Wouldn't
wanna
leave
a
stain,
now.
-Oh,
my
God.
l
knew
it.
-"Who's
first"?
No.
We
want
you
to
kill
another
person.
KURT:
Gentlemen,
gentlemen,
Your
ad
said
you
do
wet
work.
That's
correct.
I
urinate
on
other
men
for
money.
-What
was
that?
I
think
he
said
he
pisses
on
dudes.
Why
else
do
you
think
my
ad
was
Where
was
it?
-You
fucking
idiot.
-Why
look
in
the
"men
seeking
men"--?
How
do
people
They
don't,
actually.
Are
you
telling
me
that
I've
driven
all
this
NICK:
Uh-uh.
Sorry
about
that.
Can
l
use
your
toilet?
l
stored
up
Sure.
Yeah,
it's
right
through
there.
Oh,
and
by
the
way,
-Understandable.
-Two
hundred,
huh?
A
bargain.
-l
thought
it
was
such
a
good
deal.

I'll
be
in
the
car.
Okay,
but
you
guys
Am
l
gonna
have
to
give

Sir,

have
drenched
us.
DALE:
Okay,
I'm
gonna
-You
bet
your
ass
you
will.
-lt
was
an
honest
mistake.
-Oh,
you
know
how
to
find
a
killer?
Yeah,
hey,
you
know
what?
DALE:
What
are
you
doing?
GREGORY

Thank
you
for
contacting

How
may
I
be
of
service
this
evening?
Yeah,
we're
looking
for
the
most
dangerous
-We're
going
to
dinner.
Looking
for
a
bar
filled
with
criminals.
-What
do
you
got
for
us?
GREGORY:
I'm
afraid
our
listings
I
see
there's
an
Applebee's
-Perfect.
They're
not
the
kind
of
shitheads
GREGORY:
I
could
direct
you
...with
the
greatest
-Now
we're
thinking
outside
the
box.
-Love
it.
GREGORY:
Very
good,
sir.

-This
is
worse
than
getting
pissed
on.
-l'd
rather
be
pissed
on.
You
weren't
kidding,
Gregory.
You
can
stay
on
the
line.
GREGORY:

still
here,

I'm
always
curious
about
these
things,
Uh,

My

How

you
get
Gregory
from

GREGORY:

From

I'm
gonna
call
you
Gregory,
WOMAN:
Hey,

DALE:
You

his
feelings.
GREGORY:
KURT:
All
right.
Well,
thanks,
Gregory.

All
right.
All
right,
here
we
go.
NICK:
This
is
a
really
bad
idea.
-Gonna
yell
"anybody
here
kill
for
money"?
-That's
a
terrible
plan.
-Where
you
going?
All
right.
-Bowflex?

Ah.
My
man.

Hey,
uh,
does
anyone
here
-Kurt.
No,
it's
not
a
race
thing.
Uh,
I
believe
that

discriminates
BARTENDER:
"You
folks"?
Man,

a
small-business
owner.
Well,
not
you

particular,

Hit
the

-Yo.
Think
I
can
help
you
boys.
-Here
we

Hey,

Let's
follow
a
strange
guy
Somebody

y'all
looking

Yep.
-...are
you
a
businessman?
Motherfucker
Jones.
-How's
that?
Your
first
name

Motherfucker?
Not
Motherfucker.
Motherfuckah.
Negroes
say
"fuckah."
-Got
it.
Cool
name.
Yeah.
ls
that,
JONES:
My
real
name
is
Dean.
Dean
Jones.
Same
name
of
He
won't
know
who
that
is.
-l
know
who
he
is,
bitch.
I
can't
walk
around
in
this
fucking
How'd
you
get
the
name
When
I
was
a
kid,
I
snuck
DALE:
Ooh.
JONES:
She
was
sleeping
on
the
bed.
-l've
heard
enough.
-And
l
snuck
up
behind
her.
And
l
slipped
my
fingers...
Ahh.
JONES:
...into
her
purse.
JONES:
And
l
took
all
of
her
money.
-l
really
fucked
her
over.
And
that's
how
l
got
the
name
Right.
They
should
call
you
Motherfucker-Over
-What's
the
confusion?
We're
gonna
get
back
on
track
here.
...that,
you
know--
There's
three
bosses,
and
it
would
be
best
-No
longer
around
anymore.
NICK:
You
know?
You
got
the
cheese?
We
got
the
cheese.
-What
is
that,
three
hits?
That's....
-Thirty
large.
-Hungry.
DALE:
If
you
kill
two,
could
we
get
It's
no
negotiations.
-That's
more
cheese
than
we've
got.
Then
we're
in.
We're
in.
We're
in.
Right?
Hang
on.
Wouldn't
it
be
awful
I
don't
even
know
your
names.
-That
is
rude.
This
is
Dale.
Shut
the
fuck
up.
Listen.
Bring
the
money
Do
you
want
it
in
something
specific,
-Just
be
here
with
the
fucking
money.
-Put
it
in
a
briefcase.
Here
we
go.
DALE:




Looks
like
it's
all
there.
Didn't
even
need
a
briefcase.
-We
should
have
used
a
manila
envelope.
What
is
your
projected
outside
date

Ah.
I
just
got
back
from
doing
a
dime
-
That's
1
0
years.
They're
looking
at
me.
l'm
on
probation,
...l'm
going
back.
-Right.
-Period?
End
of
story?
-Wait.
You
said
you'd
take
care
of
this.
I'm
gonna
be
your
murder
consultant.
I'm
sorry,
but,
uh....
-No,
man.
Right?
That's
not
cool.
-Don't
call
me
a
hamster
now.
Come
on.
-lt's
just
upsetting.
Look,
that
is
not
what
we
talked
about,
So
how
about
we
just
take
the
money
How
about
you
go
fuck
yourself?
That's
$5000.
lf
you
think
we're
just
gonna
-l
think
you're
forgetting--
NICK:
Mr.
Motherfucker,
please,
Listen,
$5000
is
mine.
You
can
take
my
advice
-That's
a
terrible
deal.
-Okay,
$5000
worth
of
advice?
Most
killers
are
first-timers.
You
wanna
pull
off
a
brilliant
murder,
Failed
brakes,
gas
leaks,
suicide.
You
do
it
right,
you
ain't
even
Oh,
boy.
That's
five
grand
worth,
huh?
-Pretty
pedestrian.
Sounds
like
Scooby-Doo.
How
are
we
JONES:
Gotta
be
smart.
Find
out
where
they
live,
What
they
like,
what
food
they
like,
-Word.
I
have
a
job,
you
know?
That's
why
we
were
hiring,
because
Even
if
you
pull
it
off
perfectly...
...if
you
crackers
got
motives...
...the
popo...
-
That's
police.
We
all
have
clear
motives
...so
this
is
not
gonna
work.
I
got
it.
Why
don't
you
kill
each
other's
bosses?
-That's
actually
a
good
idea.
Yeah,
like
Hitchcock's
-l
didn't
see
that.
They
do
that?
That
famous
Alfred
Hitchcock,
Danny
Come
on.
You're
thinking
of
-That's
what
it
is.
Good
movie.
Same
idea,
though.
We
kill
Exactly.
Five
thousand
dollars
KURT:
No.
Not
at
all.
Well,
too
fucking
bad.
Get
out.

Hello.
Hey.
I'm
outside.
Yep.
Yeah.
I
have
to
get
Harken
What's
the
difference?
Not
like
I'll
be
down
in
three
minutes.
Three
minutes
it
is.
Bye.
-Dude,
these
seats
are
crazy
comfortable.
The
worst
report
l
have
ever
read
You're
such
a
fucking
dweeb.
Do
you
have
a
parking
space?
Who
is
it,
like
your
mother-in-law
How
you
got
this
fucking
job,


Ugh.
HARKEN:
Sorry,
everybody.
l've
been
fighting
No,
no,
no.
You're
disgusting.
Go
home.
Probably
best.
Take
all
your
work
with
you
-You
got
it.
Thank
you,
Mr.
Harken.
-Don't
forget
to
take
your
fucking
trash
can.
HARKEN:
KURT:
DALE:
l
know,
but
sometimes
on
some
KURT:
Never
have
and
they
never
will.
DALE:
Which
one,
which
one?
Stop
right
here.
Right
here,
right
here.
KURT:
We
wait
till
Pellit
makes
a
move,
-lt
is
on
like
Donkey
Kong.
-Hells
yeah,
man.

-Fire
that
the
other
way
next
time,
okay.
-Yeah.
Find
some
gum
or
lean
back.
You
had
a
shawarma,
right?
-Where'd
you
get
a
falafel?
-Mickey's
has
falafels?
No
kidding.
Why
don't
you
lean
back?
Because
he
parked
right
in
front
of
a
tree.
If
Stop
exasperating
on
me,
Through
the
nose
stinks
too,
okay?
I
hate
that
angle.
We
should
probably
get
lower.
-Slouch
down
a

That's

worth,
Oh,

Suddenly,
It's
amazing.
Can't

quiet
out
there.
NICK:
Dale?
Dude,

it.
Last
time

exciting.
Here's
what
we'll

Are
you

long,
very
slow
honks.

gonna
check
this

over

There's
nothing
on
that
side.
I
think
he's
definitely
out.
Maybe
we
can
find
a
way
in
upstairs.
Yeah,
or
maybe
there's
a
window
open.
Or
better
yet....
That
makes
things
easier,
huh?
I

the
way

so.
-l

What
about
the
way
You
realize
we're
all
going
to
jail
Man,
l
can't
go
to
jail.
Look
at
me.
Fuck,
me
too.
Yeah,
totally.
I'd
get
raped
just
as
much
-Do
you
think
you're
more
rape-able?

-You're
pretty
close
to
saying--

Holy
shit.
Yeah,
we
saw
you,
Dale.
Shh.
Yeah,
we
saw
that.
How
cool
was
that?
It
wasn't
cool
at
all.
...and
you
start
stabbing
Harken
to
death
-Harken?
I
wasn't
stabbing
anyone.
He
had
an
allergic
reaction
to
some
peanuts
He
had
a
little
allergy
shot
on
him
I
mean,
l
jabbed
him
with
that,
-Saved
a
man's
life.
So
my
boss,
who
we're
...is
dying
in
front
of
you
Well,
that
sounds
bad
-Can
you
open
the
door?
-But
l
didn't
know
it
was
Harken.
This
is
why
I
need
to
know
You're
mad
at
me
for
killing
him....
Can
we
give
him
a
time-out?
Make
up
your
fucking
mind.
lt's
like--
What
is
this?
You
gotta
admit
Harken
is
allergic
to
peanuts
Are
you
playing
this
game?
So
all
we
gotta
do
is
figure
a
way
to
get
...and
put
some
poison
in
Pellit's
coke.
It's
easy
for
someone
to
think
You
seriously
locking
me
What
about
Harken?
Probably
Doesn't
shower
with
it.
So
then
we'll
put
some
peanuts

thing
to
figure
out,
If

Why?
It's
about
weakness
and
vulnerability.

probably
would
be

Getting

out

That's
an
awesome
deal.

lt's
a

Our

something.
KURT:
Why

You

who
we
should
talk
to.
He's

far,
right?

up
about
that!

Excuse
me.
Excuse

-Shut

You

some
fucking
evil
geniuses.
Thank
you,
but

The

us
in
as

No.
All
right,
look,

his
drink.
Not
a
very
good
negotiator.
The
guy
that
killed
the
other
guy,
No,
no,
they
don't
suspect
him.
Then
this
is
what
you
need
to
do:
Get
him
to
confess
to
the
murder
A
wire?
We
can
do
that.
That's
easy.
That
how
they
got
you

never
murder
nobody.
I
never
murdered
anybody.
Wait,

You

We've
been

Everyone
