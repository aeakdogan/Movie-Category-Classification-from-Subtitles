This
is
a

...named
Charlie
Bucket.
He
was
not
faster
or
stronger
His
family
was
not
rich
In
fact,
they
barely
had
enough
to
eat.
Charlie
Bucket
was
the
luckiest
boy
He
just
didn't
know
it
yet.

Evening,
Buckets.
CHARLIE:
Soup's
almost
ready,
darling.
Don't
suppose
there's

Oh,
well.
Nothing
goes

found
something

think
you'll
like.

Charlie's

hours
were

...yet
occasionally,
It's
exactly
what
I
need.
What
is
it,
Charlie?
Dad
found
it,
just
the
piece
I
needed.
-
What
piece
was
it?
Well,
how
wonderful.
It's
quite
a
likeness.
CHARLIE:
You
think
so?
I
know
so.
I
saw
Willy
Wonka
-
I
used
to
work
for
him,
you
know.

I
did.
He

Birds.
Well,
then
we'll
need

The
man
was
a
genius.
Did
you
know
he
invented
a
new
way
...so
that
it
stays
cold
for
hours
You
can
even
leave
it
lying
in
the
sun
-
But
that's
impossible.
GRANDPA
JOE:
...he
decided
to
build
The
largest
chocolate
factory
Fifty
times
as
big
as
any
other.
Grandpa,
don't
make
it
gross.
Tell
him
about
the
Indian
prince.
You
mean,
Prince
Pondicherry?
Well,
Prince
Pondicherry
...and
asked
him
to
come
...and
build
him
a
colossal
palace

WONKA:
...and
everything
will
be
made
GRANDPA
JOE:
True
to
his
word,
...and
the
cement
holding
All
the
walls
and
ceilings
So
were
the
carpets
It
is
perfect
in
every
way.
Yeah,
but
it
won't
last
long.
Oh,
nonsense.
I
will
not
eat
my
palace.
I
intend
to
live
in
it.
But
Mr.
Wonka
was
right,
of
course.
Soon
after
this,
there
came
Mmm.

The
prince
sent
an
urgent

day,
without
warning...

Wonka
told
every
single
one
He
announced
that
he
was
closing
I'm
closing
my
chocolate
factory
I'm
sorry.
But
it
didn't
close
forever.
Ah,
yes,

say
Such
as,
"I

No.

But
then,
who's
running
the
machines?
-
Nobody
knows,
Charlie.
Hasn't
someone
asked
Mr.
Wonka?
Nobody
sees
him
anymore.
The
only
thing
that
comes
...already
packed
and
addressed.
I'd
give
anything
in
the
world
...and
see
what's
become
Well,
you
won't,
because
you
can't.
It's
a
mystery,
That
little
factory
of
yours,
Charlie,
is
as
Come
on,
Charlie.
I
think
it's
time

Good
night,
Grandpa
George.

Night-night.
Thank
you,

Good
night,

Nothing's
impossible,
Charlie.

Good
night.

well.

you

you're

What's
happening?
Because
it
goes
a
little
funny
It's
the

that
does
it.
I'm
terribly
sorry.
Mother?
What's
happening
to
me?
She's
swelling
up.
Like
a

I've
tried

It's
just
weird.
But
I
can't

How
is
she

to

You
could

her
in

We
gotta

that

VIOLET:
Please.
Come
on.
Let's
boogie.
Without
the
boat,
we'll
have
to
move
There's
too
much
to
see.
-
Mr.
Wonka?
Why
did
you
decide
to
let
people
in?
So
they
could
see
the
factory,
But
why
now?
And
why
only
five?
What's
the
special
prize,
The
best
kind
of
prize
is
a
surprise.

Will
Violet
always
be
a
blueberry?
No.
Maybe.
I
don't
know.
That's
what
you
get
from
chewing
gum
If
you
hate
gum
so
much,
Once
again,
you
shouldn't
mumble.
Can
you
remember
the
first
candy
No.
NARRATOR:
...the
first
candy
he
ever
ate.
I'm
sorry,
I
was
having
a
flashback.
I
see.
These
flashbacks
happen
often?
Increasingly...
...today.

Ah,
this
is
a
room
I
know
all
about.
For
you
see,
Mr.
Wonka,
Are
you
using
the
Havermax
4000
No.
You're
really
weird.

-
Squirrels.
These
squirrels
are
specially
trained
Why
use
squirrels?
Because
only
squirrels
can
get

See

they

Look.
I
think

a
bad
nut.
Daddy,
I
want
a
squirrel.
Get
me
one
of
those
squirrels.
Veruca,
dear,
All
I've
got
at
home
is
one
pony
and
...and
two
parakeets
and
three
canaries
...and
a
silly
old
hamster.
All
right,
pet.
Daddy
will
get
you
a
squirrel
But
I
don't
want
any
old
squirrel,
Very
well.
Mr.
Wonka,
how
much
do
you
want
Name
your
price.
Oh,
they're
not
for
sale.
Daddy.

Mr.
Wonka's
being
unreasonable.
If
you
won't
get
me
a
squirrel,
Veruca.
Little
girl?
Veruca,
come
back
here
at
once.
Veruca.
Little
girl?
Don't
touch
that
squirrel's
nuts.
It'll
make
him
crazy.
I'll
have
you.
MR.
SALT:
Veruca.
No!
Veruca!

Let's
find
the
key.
Nope.
Not
that
one.
-
Daddy!
No.
It's
not
that
one.
There
it
is.
There
it
isn't.
Daddy,
I
want
them
to
stop.
What
are
they
doing?
They're
testing
to
see

Oh,
my
goodness.
MR.
SALT:
Daddy!
Where
are
they
taking
her?
Where
all
the
other
bad
nuts
go.
-
Where
does
the
chute
go?
But
don't
worry.
Today
is
Tuesday.
There's
always
the
chance

-
Ah!
Now,
she
may
be
stuck
in

If
that's
the
case,
all
you
have
to
do
Okay?

different

An

from
an

A
steak
that
no

else
would

And
lots
of
other
things
as

are

on

WONKA:

The

by

the
most
There
can't

floors.
How

This
isn't
an
ordinary
This
elevator
can
go
sideways,

any
other
ways
You
just
press
any

Oh,
look.
Look.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Oh.
I'd
rather
not
talk
about
this
one.
This
is

It's
relatively
new.
Ah,
the

offices.
Hello,
Doris.
Why
is
everything
here
Candy
doesn't
have
to
have
a
point.
That's
why
it's
candy.

But

here
Sorry,
son.
We're

for
the

I

Go
ahead.
Here.
Put
these

light
could

your

we
certainly
don't
want
that,
This
is
the
testing
room
for
my
Television
Chocolate.
One
day
it
occurred
to
me:
"Hey,
if
television
can
break
up
...into
millions
and
millions
of
tiny
pieces
...then
reassemble
it
...why
can't
I
do
the
same
Why
can't
I
send
a
real
bar
...through
the
television,
I'm
not
gonna
touch
it.
MR.
TEAVEE:
MIKE:
You
don't
understand
anything
First
off,
there's
a
difference
between
Second,
the
amount
of
power
it
...would
be
like
nine
atomic
bombs.
Mumbler!
Seriously,
I
cannot
understand
Okey-dokey.
I
shall
now
send
a
bar
of
chocolate
...to
the
other
by
television.
Bring
in
the
chocolate.
It's
gotta
be
real
big
...you
can
film
a
regular-size
man,
Same
basic
principle.
It's
gone.
Told
you.
That
chocolate
is
now
rushing
...in
a
million
tiny
little
pieces.
Come
over
here.
Watch
the
screen.
Here
it
comes.
Oh,
look.
-
Take
it.
Scaredy-cat.
You
take
it.
Go
on.
Just
reach
out
and
grab
it.
Go
on.
Holy
buckets.
Eat
it.
Go
on.
It'll
be
delicious.
It's
the
same
bar.
It's
just
gotten
a
little
smaller
It's
great.
It's
a
miracle.
So
imagine,
you're
sitting
at
home
...and
suddenly
a
commercial
will
flash
"Wonka's
chocolates
If
you
don't
believe
us,
And
you
simply
reach
out
and
take
it.
How
about
that?
So
can
you
send
other
things?
Say,
like,
breakfast
cereal?
Do
you
have
any
idea
It's
those
little
curly
wooden
shavings
But
could
you
send
it
by
TV
-
Of
course
I
could.
Well,
why
would
I
wanna
send
a
person?
Don't
you
realize
what
you've
invented?
It's
the
most
important
invention
And
all
you
think
about
is
chocolate.
Calm
down,
Mike.
I
think
Mr.
Wonka
knows
No,
he
doesn't.
He
has
no
idea.
You
think
he's
a
genius,
But
I'm
not.
Hey,
little
boy.
Don't
push
my
button.
He's
gone.
Let's
go

the

I
sure

Hey,

Yeah.

I
want
you
to

up
to

out.

There's

Now,

many

are

Mr.

You
mean,
you're

Yes.
What

to
the
others?
Oh,
my
dear
boy,
Oh,
I
do
congratulate
you.
I
really
do.
I'm
absolutely
delighted.
I
had
a
hunch
right
from
the
beginning.
Now,

have

I've

But
I
want
it.
Where
do
you

Right
over
there.
That
little
house.

time
do
you

Hard
to
know,

I
think
there's
someone
at
the
door.
Hi,

Mom.
Dad.
We're
back.
MR.

Charlie.
Goodness.
This
is
Willy

I
see
that.
You
must
be
the
boy's...

Parents?
He
says
Charlie's
won
something.
Not
just
some
something.
The
most
"something"
something
I'm
gonna
give
this
little
boy
You
must
be
joking.
No,
really.
It's
true.
Because
you
see,
a
few
months
ago,
...and
I
had
the
strangest
revelation.
WONKA:
...I
saw
reflected
my
life's
work...
...my
factory,
Who
would
watch
over
them
I
realized
in
that
moment:
I
must
find
a
heir.
And
I
did,
Charlie.
You.
That's
why
you
sent
out
Uh-huh.

I
invited
five
children
to
the
factory...
...and
the
one
who
was
the
least
rotten
That's
you,
Charlie.
So,
what
do
you
say?
Are
you
ready
to
leave
all
this
behind
Sure.
Of
course.
I
mean,
it's
all
right
Oh,
my
dear
boy,
of
course
they
can't.
You
can't
run
a
chocolate
factory...
...with
a
family
hanging
over
you
None
taken,
jerk.
A
chocolatier
has
to
run
free
and
solo.
He
has
to
follow
his
dreams.
Look
at
me.
I
had
no
family,
So
if
I
go
with
you
to
the
factory,
Yeah.
Consider
that
a
bonus.
Then
I'm
not
going.
I
wouldn't
give
up
my
family
Not
for
all
the
chocolate
in
the
world.
Oh,
I
see.
That's
weird.
There's
other
candy
too
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Wonka.
Wow.
Well,
that's
just...
...unexpected...
...and
weird.
But
I
suppose,
in
that
case,
I'll
just...
Goodbye,
then.
Sure
you
won't
change
your
mind?
I'm
sure.
Okay.
Bye.
Things
are
going
to
get
much
better.
NARRATOR:
...knew
exactly
what
The
next
morning,
Charlie
helped
Grandpa
Joe
spent
the
whole
day
He
didn't
feel
tired
at
all.
Charlie's
father
got
a
better
job
...repairing
the
machine
Things
had
never
been
better
The
same
could
not
be
said
I
can't
put
my
finger
on
it.
Candy's
the
only
thing
...and
now
I'm
just
not
I
don't
know
which
flavors
to
make
I'm
second-guessing
myself,
I've
always
made
whatever
candy
That's
just
it,
isn't
it?
I
make
the
candy
I
feel
like,
but
now
You're
very
good.
MAN:
Pity
about
that
chocolate
fellow,
-
Willy
Wonka.
Says
here
in
the
paper
his
new
candies
But
I
suppose
maybe
he's
just
-
Yep.
You
ever
met
him?
I
did.
I
thought
he
was
great
at
first,
He
also
has
a
funny
haircut.
I
do
not!
-
Why
are
you
here?
What
makes
you
feel
better
My
family.
Ew.
What
do
you
have
against
my
family?
It's
not
just
your
family.
They
tell
you
what
to
do,
...and
it's
not
conducive
Usually
they're
just
trying
to
protect
you
If
you
don't
believe
me,
Ask
who?
My
father?
No
way.
At
least,
not
by
myself.
You
want
me
to
go
with
you?
Hey.
Hey,
what
a
good
idea.
Yeah!
And
you
know
what?
I
have
to
be
more
careful
I
think
we've
got
the
wrong
house.

Do
you
have
an
appointment?
No.
But
he's
overdue.
Open.
Now,
let's
see
what
the
damage
is,
Heavens.
I
haven't
seen
bicuspids
Since...
Willy?
Hi,
Dad.
All
these
years...
...and
you
haven't
flossed.
Not
once.
NARRATOR:
...that
Willy
Wonka
...who
accepted
on
one
condition.
Sorry
we're
late.
Thought
I
heard
thunder.
-
You
staying
for
dinner,
Willy?
I'll
shuffle
the
plates.
You
smell
like
peanuts.
-
I
love
peanuts.
You
smell
like...
...old
people
and
soap.
I
like
it.
Elbows
off
the
table,
Charlie.
How
do
you
feel
about
With
licorice
instead
of
string.
-
Boys,
no
business
at
the
dinner
table.
I
think
you're
on
to
something,
NARRATOR:
In
the
end
Charlie
Bucket
But
Willy
Wonka
got
something
A
family.
And
one
thing
was
absolutely
certain:
Life
had
never
been
sweeter.
