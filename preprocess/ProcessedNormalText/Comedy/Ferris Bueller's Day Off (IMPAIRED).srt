This

It's

If
I
go

I'll
have
to
barf

The
key
to

It's
a
good
non-specific
symptom
A
lot
of
people
will
tell
you
But
if
you
get
a
nervous
mother,
You
fake
a
stomach
cramp
When
you're
bent
over
wailing,
It's
childish
and
stupid,
Life
moves
pretty
fast
If
you
don't

You

I
had
a
meeting
this
morning.
Are
you
also
aware

that
Ferris
does
not
have
What?
He
has
missed
an
unacceptable
Ferris
is
not
taking
I've
spent
my
morning
If
Ferris
thinks
he
can
coast
through
I
have
no
reservation
whatsoever
about
holding
him
back
-
This
is
all
news
to
me
-
He
has
been
absent
nine
times

Nine
times
That's
probably
because
he
Wake
up
and
smell

coffee
It's
a
fool's

He's

I
can't
believe
it.
He
has
missed

I
asked
for
a

I
got

Grace!
Mr
Rooney,
Ferris
is
home
-
I
debated
even
leaving
him.
At
this
time
of
year,
children
But
I
can
assure
you
Never
had
one
lesson
In
1930
the
House
of
Representatives,
Anyone?
The
Great
Depression
The
Hawley-Smoot
Tariff
Act
Which
raised
or
lowered?
Raised
tariffs
in
an
effort
to
collect
Did
it
work?
It
did
not
work
and
the
United
States
Today,
we
have
a
similar
debate
Anyone
seen
this
before?
The
Laffer
Curve
It
says
that
at
this
point
you
will
get
exactly
the
same
Does
anyone
know
Anyone?
Something-doo
economics
Jeanie,
I'm
really
sorry
What
are
you
sorry
for?
-
I
heard
he's
really
sick
A
bunch
of
people
I
heard
that
if
Ferris
dies,
He's
such
a
sweetie
Got
to
go
-
Hi,
Jeanie
How
desperate
is
the
situation?
Did
you
see
"Alien"?
When
the
creature
It
feels
like
that
-
Are
you
kidding?
-
It's
Ferris
Bueller
We
appreciate
you
letting
us
I
hope
he
doesn't
die
-
Give
me
somebody
else
-
Did
you
see
"Alien"?
Hello?
Hi,
Ferris,
how's
your
bod?
You're
dying?
-
Is
it
serious?
-
I
may
need
a
kidney
transplant
-
Excuse
me
-
Yeah,
I'd
say
so
I
don't
trust
this
kid
With
your
bad
knee,
Ed,
What
is
so
dangerous
about
him
The
last
thing
I
need
is
1,500
Bueller
He
jeopardises
my
ability
-
He
makes
you
look
like
an
ass
He's
very
popular
Sportoes,
motorheads,
geeks,
-
dweebies,
dickheads,
That
is
why
I
have
got
to
catch
him
To
show
these
kids
that
his
example
Ed!
You
sounded
Really?
Thanks,
Grace
-
You
can't
make
me
wait
like
this
It's
my
ninth
sick
day
If
I
get
caught,
-
Do
you
know
what
my
diastolic
is?
-
Get
dressed
and
come
on
over
Hold
your
water
for
a
second
-
Ferris.
You
sound
terrible.
-
Were
you
sleeping?
-
Sure,
pal
-
Cameron,
it's
my
dad
If
you're
not
over
here
in
15
minutes,
Dad,
all
this
talking
has
made
me
-
I
think
I
ought
to
lie
down
-
Wrap
a
hot
towel
round
my
head?
-
Ferris,
I
love
you,
pal
I
bet
Cameron
is
sitting
in
his
car
He'll
keep
calling
me
until
I
come
over
He'll
make
me
feel
guilty
This
is
ridiculous
I'll
go
I'll
go
I'll
go
Shit!
Goddammit!
Forget
it
That's
it
In
what
way
does
the
author's
symbolise
the
protagonist's
struggle?
And
how
does
this
relate
to
our
discussion
Mr
Nolan,
may
I
interrupt,
please?
Sloane
Peterson,
I'm
afraid
that
I
am
the
bearer
Your
father
called

No
-
Dead
grandmother?
I
had
Florence
Sparrow
-
Who
is
this
girl
going
out
with?
I
do
see
her
with
Ferris
Bueller
Would
you
get
me
-
Ed
Rooney's
Office
Please
hold
Do
you
still
want

Ed
Rooney
-
How
are
you
today,
sir?
Yeah,
I
heard
I'm
all
broken
up
Yeah,
it's
been
a
tough
morning.
We've
got
a
lot
of
family
business.
If
you
wouldn't
mind
excusing
Sloane,
Sure,
I'd
be
happy
to
You
just
produce
a
corpse,
I
want
to
see
this
dead
grandmother
It's
all
right,
it's
Ferris
Bueller
Ed,
I'm
sorry,
did
you
say
Yeah,
roll
her
old
bones
over
here
That's
school
policy
No,
my
wife's
mother.
-
Ed
Rooney's
Office
Hold
I'll
tell
you
what,
dipshit,
-
you
can
come
down
here
-
Pucker
up,
Buttercup
What?
Mr
Rooney,
Could
my
sister
bring
home
Have
a
nice
day.
Mr
Peterson
-
I
should
say
you
do
I
think
you
should
be
sorry,
A
family
member
dies
and
you
Well
I
really
don't
know
I
didn't
think
I
was
talking
to
you.
You
know
that
I
would
never
Pardon
my
French,
You're
absolutely
right,
sir
-
This
isn't
over
yet
Do
you
read
me?

Call
me
"sir",
goddammit!
That's
better.
You

Bueller
Ferris

Impossible
You're
doing
great
Rooney!

Just
a
moment
I
don't
have
all
day
to
bark
at
you,
I
want
my
daughter
out
-
What?
-
Talk

Talk!
I
want
you
out
there
with
her
We
don't
have
time
to
talk
right
now
-
What's
wrong
with
you?
-
Where's
your
brain?
How
can
we
pick
up
Sloane
I
said
for
her
to
be
there
alone
I
didn't
hit
you
You
hit
me
Don't
ask
me
to
participate
in
your
crap
You
make
me
get
out
of
bed
You
make
me
make
a
phoney
call
The
man
could
squash
my
nuts
-
And
you
deliberately
hurt
my
feelings
I
did
not
deliberately

What
are
you
doing?
-
Have
a
nice
life
I
didn't
mean
to
lose
my
temper

Seriously?

Here
you
go
You
did
screw
up
though,
right?

completely

are
you
talking
about?
My
father
loves

A
man
with
such
priorities
No
Apparently
you
don't
understand
He
never
drives

Remember
how
insane
he
went
That
was
a
piece
of

We
can't

up
Sloane
in

Mr
Rooney

It's
not

Don't

Yeah,

What

Nothing
Me

You're

Okay,

A
lot

people
saw

Who'd
believe
I
was
in

Anybody

would

That
was
so

This
looks
okay
to
me,

Here

Thank
you
You're

Watch

My

Bueller
You
hope
my

feeling
better?
I
am

I
need
help!
Speak

He

You
shithead!
I
feel
pretty
good
I

good
Those

were
nice
It
turned

Hey

Cameron
How
many
miles
did
you
say
126
and
halfway
Why?
How
many
miles
are
on
it
now?
Here's
where
Cameron
goes
berserk
CAMERON
HOWLS
Cameron,
are
you
okay?
SLOANE:
Cut
that
out
Who
is
it?
I'm
sorry,
I
can't
come
to

door
-
I
could
take

Thank
headache,
fever
and
a

I
came
to
help
restore
your
pluck
'cause
I'm
the
nurse
who
likes
to...
This
may
very
well
be
for
real
He
might
have
blown
He's
always
been
a
little
keyed
up
We're
going
to
graduate
soon
We'll
have
the
summer
We'll
see
each
other
at
night
Then
he'll
go
to
one
school
Basically
that
will
be
it
Sloane's
as
big
a
problem
She
has
another
year
of
high
school
I
was
serious
Cameron?
Can
you
hear
me?
Cameron,
blink
if
you
understand
me
Cameron
has
never
been
in
love
If
things
don't
change
for
him,
And
she's
going
to
treat
him
like
shit,
what
he
has
built
up
in
his
mind
as
She
won't
respect
him
You
can't
respect
somebody
who
Ferris,
we'd
better
try
something
else
Are
you
feeling
better,
Cameron?
Why
don't
you
come
in
here?
Cameron,
I
can
flip
out
real
easy,
too
Sooner
or
later,
Maybe
he's
really
sick
Hey!
Hey,
Cameron!
Cameron,
wake
up
Come
on,
Cameron
Wake
up!
-
What
is
that?
-
That
was
pretty
impressive,
man
It's
not
funny
Drugs?
Thank
you,
no
I'm
straight
I
meant,
are
you
in
here
for
drugs?
-
Why
are
you
here?
-
I
don't
know
why
I'm
here
Why
don't
you
You
wear
too
much
eye
make-up
My
sister
wears
too
much
-
You
don't
want
to
talk
about
it?
-
I'm
serious
All
right,
I
know
what's
wrong
In
a
nutshell,
I
hate
my
brother
That's
cool
No,
not
yet
He
was
ditching
school
When
I
went
The
cops
picked
me
up
What
do
you
care
-
Everybody
else
has
to
go
-
I'd
get
caught
You're
pissed
off
because
he
ditches
-
Basically
-
Your
problem
is
you
Worry
about
yourself,
-
That's
just
an
opinion
Keep
your
opinions
to
yourself
There's
somebody
you
should
talk
to
If
you
say
Ferris
Bueller,
Oh,
you
know
him
That
whole
time
I
was
like
meditating
Then
I
sort
of
watched
myself
I
realised
it
was
ridiculous
Worrying
about
everything
All
that
shit
I'm
tired
of
it
It
was
the
best
day
of
my
life
I'm
going
to
miss
you
guys
next
year
Cameron,
can
I
ask
you
a
question?
Yeah
Did
you
see
me
change
Did
you?
You
saw
me?
That's
okay
I'm
not
embarrassed
I
better
check
on
the
car
Hey,
Ferris!
Yeah?
The
miles
aren't
coming
off
No
We
have
to
open
the
odometer,
No,
forget
it
Forget
it
I've
got
to
take
a
stand
I'm
bullshit
I
put
up
with
everything
My
old
man
pushes
me
around
I
never
say
anything
He's
not
the
problem
I've
got
to
take
a
stand
I've
got
to
take
a
stand
against
him
I
am
not
going
to
sit
on
my
ass
as
the
events
that
affect
me
unfold
I'm
going
to
take
a
stand
and
defend
it
Right
or
wrong,
I'm
so
sick
of
this
shit
I
can't
stand
him
Who
do
you
love?
You
love
a
car
You
son
of
a
bitch
CAMERON:
Shit
I
dented
the
shit
out
of
it
Good
My
father
will
see
what
I
did
He'll
come
home
I
don't
care
I
really
don't
I'm
just
tired
of
being
afraid
The
hell
with
him
I
can't
wait
to
see
the
look
What
did
I
do?
-
What
did
I
do?
Whoa!
Holy
shit!
It's
my
fault
When
he
comes
home,
we'll
tell
him
No,
I'll
take
it
-
I'll
take
it
If
I
didn't
want
it,
-
I
made
you
take
that
car
I
want
it
When
Morris
comes
home,
CAMERON:
It's
cool
Thanks
anyway
This
is
a
shock
to
me
And
why
would
she
come
up
For
whatever
reason
she
did
it,
I
appreciate
you
calling
Thank
you
-
I
hope
your
son
is
feeling
better
Tell
him
all
the
guys
at
the
station
Right
-
Hi
I
want
to
get
out
of
here
now
Okay
Fine!
-
She's
a
little
hyper
Let's
not
ruin
this
-
You
didn't
tell
me
your
name
But
a
lot
of
guys
call
me
Shauna
-
Okay,
Jean
That's
great
I'll
see
you,
okay?
MUM:
Jeanie,
now!
-
Now!
-
I
had
a
great
time
today
Will
Cameron
be
okay?
Yeah,
sure,
He's
going
to
be
just
fine
You
knew
what
you
were
doing
Me?
No
Oh,
shit!
I
have
to
go
-
I'll
call
you
tonight
-
I
love
you
He's
going
to
marry
me
Do
you
know
what
it's
like
to
pick
up
I
was
about
to
close
the
deal
I
was
going
to
take
my
commission
What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
Look
at
this
mess
I'll
never
-
Slow
down
Hi,
I'm
Ferris
Bueller
FERRIS:
No,
don't
get
up
-

Dinner's
ready
What's
wrong?
Everything
I
just
picked
up
Jeanie
She
got
a
speeding
ticket
and
I
lost
Looking
for
this?
I
got
you,
Ferris
How's
Ferris?
I
have
dreamed
about
this
you
little
bastard,
Ferris,
we're
home
How
would
you
feel
Under
my
close,
Hi
Thank
God
you're
all
right
Thank
you,
Mr
Rooney,
Go
upstairs
and
get
in
bed
Scoot!
Can
you
imagine
someone
that
sick
Kids!
By
the
way,

left
your
wallet
SNORING
Honey

He's
still
awfully
warm
150%
better,
thank
you
Don't
make
me
stay
home
again
I
have
to
graduate
in
June,
Ferris,
you're
sick
Don't
push
it
-
Maybe
you're
right,
Dad
-
How
did
you
get
to
be
so
sweet?
Blanket
Get
well
I'm
going
to
get
myself
settled,
I've
said
it
before
and
I'll
say
If
you
don't
stop
and
look
around
Four
years
I've
been
chasing
this
kid
Four
years
he's
been
Hey,
Mr
Rooney,
what's
going
on?
Did
you
get
in
a
fight?
Do
you
want
a
lift?
I
bet
you
never
smelled
Gummi
bear?
They've
been
in
my
pocket
You're
still
here?
It's
over
Go
home
Go
