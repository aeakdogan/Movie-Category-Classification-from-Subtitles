This
is
your
lunch,
OK?
Now,
I
put
a
dollar
in
there
You
can
ask
one
of
the
big
kids
You
remember
your
phone
number?
Put
it
in
your
pocket,
OK?
You
ready?
I
think
so.
It's
Cady's
big
day.
I
guess
it's
natural
for
parents
to
cry
But,
you
know,
this
usually
I'm
16
and
until
today,
I
know
what
you're
thinking.
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Or
that
we're
weirdly
religious
And
on
the
third
day,
God
created
so
that
Man
could
fight
the
dinosaurs.
And
the
homosexuals.
-
Amen.
But
my
family's
totally
normal.
Except
for
the
fact
that
both
my
and
we've
spent
the
last
I
had
a
great
life.
But
then
my
mom
got
offered
tenure
So
it
was
goodbye
Africa
I'm
OK.
Sorry.
I'll
be
careful.
Hi.
I
don't

there.
Kristen
Hey,
baby.
He
farts
a
lot.
Hey,
everybody.
Oh,
God,
I'm
so
sorry.
It's

My
T-shirt's

everything
all
right
in
here?

Oh,

was
your
summer?
My

Well,
I
just
wanted
to
let
that
we
have
a
new
student
joining
us.
She
just
moved
here
Welcome.
-
I'm
from
Michigan.
Her
name
is
Cady.
Cady
Heron.
-
Where
are
you,
Cady?
-
It's
pronounced
like
Katie.
I
have
a
nephew
named
Anfernee,
and
I
know
how
mad
he
gets
Almost
as
mad
as
I
get
that
my
sister
named
him
Anfernee.
Well,
welcome,
Cady.

And
thank
you,
Mr.

Thanks.
Maybe

other
time,
OK.
OK.
Good
day,
everybody.
The
first
day
of
school
was
a
blur.
A
stressful,
surreal
blur.
I
got
in
trouble
for
the
-
Where
are
you
going?
You
need
the
lavatory
pass.
OK.
Can
I
have
the
lavatory
pass?
Nice
try.
Have
a
seat.
I
had
never
lived
in
a
world
where
they
were
always
yelling
at
me.
-
Don't
read
ahead!
No
food
in
class!
I
told
you,
I
saw
the
whole
thing.
-
Everything.
-
It
only
counts
if
you
saw
a
nipple.
I
had
a
lot
of
friends
in
Africa.
What?
But
so
far,
none
in
Evanston.
Hey.
How
was
your
first
day?
Is

Why
would
we
get
you
into
trouble?
We're
your
friends.
I
know
it's
wrong
to
skip
class,
And
I
was
in
no
position
I
guess
I'll
never
know
what
I
missed
Don't
have
sex.
Because
you
Don't

next
to
her
She
asked
me
how
to
spell
"orange".
And
that
little
one?
She's
totally
rich
because
Gretchen
Wieners
knows
She
knows
everything
That's
why
her
hair
is
so
big.
And
evil
takes
a
human
Don't
be
fooled,
because
she
may
seem
slut-faced
ho-bag.
But
in
reality,
She's

The

Those

She

I
hear
she

car
commercials.
Her
favorite
movie
is
Varsity
blues.
One
time,
she
met
John
Stamos
And
he
told
her
she
was
pretty.
One
time,
It
was
awesome.
She
always
looks
fierce.

You

your
freshmen,
preps,
JV
jocks,
Asian
nerds,
cool
Asians,
varsity
jocks,
unfriendly
black
hotties,
girls
who
eat
their
feelings,
girls
who
don't
eat
anything,
desperate

burnouts,
sexually
active

geeks,
the
greatest
people
and
the
worst.
Hey.
We're

lunchtime
Can

a
party
and

poor,
innocent
She's
not
interested.
Do
you
wanna

So

your
back
now.
Bye,
Jason.
Bitch.
Wait.
Sit
down.
Seriously,

down.
Why
don't
I
know
you?
I'm
new.
I
just
moved
here
from
Africa.
-
What?
Wait.
What?
-
My
mom
taught
me
at
home...
I
know
what
home-school
is.
So
you've
actually
never
been
Shut
up.
Shut
up.
-
I
didn't
say
anything.
-
That's
really
interesting.
But
you're,
like,
really
pretty.
-
Thank
you.
-
What?
-
Oh,
I
don't
know...
-
Where
did
you
get
it?
-
It's
adorable.
-
What
is
"fetch"?
So
if
you're
from
Africa...
...why
are
you
white?
Oh,
my
God,
Karen,
you
can't
just
Could
you
give
us
some
privacy
Yeah,
sure.
What
are
you
doing?
OK,
you
should
just
know
so
this
is,
like,
a
really
huge
deal.
We
wanna
invite
you
every
day
for
the
rest
of
the
week.
-
Oh,
it's
OK...
So
we'll
see
you
tomorrow.
On
Wednesdays,
we
wear
pink.
Oh,
my
God!
And
then
you
have
to
tell
me
all
Regina
seems
sweet.
Regina
George
is
not
sweet.
She's
a
scum-sucking
road
whore!
She's
fabulous,
but
she's
evil.
-
Hey,
get
out
of
here!
I
love
your
work!
-
Why
do
you
hate
her?
Regina.
You
seem
to
really
hate
her.
Yes.
What's
your
question?
-
Well,
my
question
is,
why?
-
that
Janis
was...
Now,
look.
This
isn't
I
just
think
that
it
would
be,
like,
if
you
were
to
hang
out
with
them
and
-
What
do
we
even
talk
about?
-
Ashton
Kutcher.
Would
you
just
do
it?
Please?
OK,
fine.
-
Yes.
By
eighth
period,
I
was
so
happy
I
mean,
I'm
good
at
math.
Nothing
in
math
class
Hey,

you
have
a
pencil
I've
only
had
one
other
His
name
was
Nfume,
It
didn't
work
out.
But
this
one
hit
me
like
a
big,

Cady,
what
do
you
say?
So
cute.
I
mean,
A-sub-N
equals
That's
right.
That's
good.
Very
good.
All
right,
let's
talk
Hey.
How
was
your
second
day?
-
Fine.
-
No.
Yeah.
Having
lunch
with
The
Plastics
and
entering
"Girl
World".
And
Girl
World
had
a
lot
of
rules.
You
can't
wear
a
tank
top
and
you
can
only
wear
your
So
I
guess
you
picked
today.
Oh,
and
we
only
wear
jeans
Now,
if
you
break
any
of
these
rules,
I
mean,
not
just
you.
Like,
any
of
us.
OK,
like,
if
I
was
wearing
jeans
today,
I
would
be
sitting
over
there
Oh,
and
we
always
vote
before
we
ask
because
you
have
to
be
considerate
Well,
I
mean,
you
wouldn't
buy
a
skirt
-
if
it
looks
good
on
you.
Right.
Like,
you
may
think
you
like
someone,
A
hundred
and
twenty
calories
and
48
Forty-eight
into
120?
I'm
only
eating
foods
with
less
than
It's
40
percent.
Well,
48
over
120
and
then
you
cross-multiply
Whatever.
I'm
getting
cheese
fries.
So
have
you
seen
any
guys
Well,
there's
this
guy
-
Who
is
it?
-
His
name's
Aaron
Samuels.
Oh,
no,
you
can't
like
Aaron
Samuels.
That's
Regina's
ex-boyfriend.
They
went
out
for
a
year.
Yeah,
and
then
she
was
devastated
when
he
broke
up
I
thought
she
dumped
him
OK,
irregardless.
Ex-boyfriends
I
mean,
that's
just,
like,
Don't
worry.
I'll
never
tell
Regina
It'll
be
our
little
secret.
We
define
the
sum
Even
though
I
wasn't
I
was
still
allowed
to
look
at
him.
And
think
about
him.
And
talk
to
him.

be
perfect

over.
Because

My
nail
beds

your
hair?
You
girls

Oh,
my
God,
I
remember
this.

I
haven't
looked
at
that
in
forever.
It's
our
Burn
Book.
See,

cut
out
girls'
pictures
and
then
we
wrote
comments.
-
"Trang
Pak
is
a
grotsky
little

"Dawn
Schweitzer
is
a
fat
virgin."
"Amber

Yeah.
He's
almost
too
gay
That's
funny.
Put

Maybe
that
was
only
OK
And
they
have
this
Burn
Book
-
about
all
the
girls
in
our
grade.
-
You're
not
in
it.
-
Will
this
minimize
my
pores?
you
gotta
steal
that
book.
-
No
way!
and
then
everybody
would
see
-
I
don't
steal.
Cady,
there
are
two
kinds
People
who
do
evil
stuff,
and
people
who
see
evil
stuff
Does
that
mean
I'm
morally
Oh,
my
God,
that's
Ms.

I
don't
care,
But

me
just
tell
you
something
All
he
cares
about
is
school

Is
that
bad?
Whatever.
I
mean,
I
could
talk
Really?
You

survived
my

And
with
Regina's
blessing,
I
started
On
October
3rd,
he
asked
me
It's
October
3rd.
Two
weeks
later,
we
spoke
again.
It's
raining.
Yeah.
But
I
wanted
things
to
move
faster.
So
I
followed
my
instincts.
Hey,
I'm
totally
lost.
-
But
I
wasn't
lost.
I
knew
exactly
what
Ms.
Norbury
It's
a
factorial,
so
you
multiply
Wrong.
Is
that
the
summation?
Yeah,
they're
the
same
thing.
Wrong.
He
was
so
wrong.
Thanks.
I...
I
get
it
now.
Lights,
please.
We're
having
a
Halloween
party
You
wanna
come?
Yeah,
sure.
Great.
Here's
where
it
is.
It's
a
costume
party.
OK.
That
flier
admits
one
person
only,
so
don't
bring
some
"Grool."
I
meant
to
say
"cool"
Right.
Well...
grool.
See
you
tonight.
Hey,
Africa.
You
staying
Yeah,
I'll
be
right
back.
OK,
I
lied.
But
I
had
to
go
home
In
the
regular
world,
Halloween
is
and
beg
for
candy.
In
Girl
World,
Halloween
when
a
girl
can
dress
and
no
other
girls
can
The
hard-core
girls
just
wear
lingerie
and

of
animal
ears.
Doesn't
she
look
great,
honey?
-
What
are
you?
Unfortunately,
no
one
told
So
I
showed
up
like
this.
Hey.
Yes!
Yes!
Hey.
Why
are
you
dressed
so
scary?
It's
Halloween.
Have
you
seen
Jason?
You
know
who's
looking
fine
tonight?
Seth
Mosakowski.
-
OK,
you
did
not
just
say
that.
He's
your
cousin.
Yeah,
but
he's
my
first
cousin.
-
Right.
and
then
you
have
your
first
cousins,
-
then
you
have
your
second
cousins...
That's
not
right,
is
it?
That
is
so
not
right.
-
Hey!
You
made
it.
And
you
are...
a
zombie
bride.
An
"ex-wife".
Love
it.
Can
I
get
you
-
Yeah.
Thanks.
Karen,
stop
it.
-
Don't,
Karen...
Hey.
Oh,
no.
Didn't
anybody
tell
you?
You
were
supposed
Shut
up.
I
need
to
talk
to
you.
-
You
know
that
girl
Cady?
I
invited
her
tonight.
Well,
be
careful
because
Really?
How
do
you
know?
Because
she
told
me.
She
tells
everybody.
She's
like
a
little
girl.
She,
like,
"Mrs.
Aaron
Samuels."
And
she
made
this
T-shirt
that
says
and
she
wears
it
-
Oh,
come
on.
I
mean,
you're
gorgeous.
And
OK,
look,
I'm
not
saying
but
she
saved
and
she
said
she's
gonna
do
to
make
you
like
her.
What?
This
was
it.
Regina
said
she
would
talk
I
know
she's
kind
of
socially
retarded
so
just
promise
me
Of
course
I'm
not
gonna
How
could
Janis
hate
Regina?
She
was
such
a
good...
Slut!
What
are
you
doing?
That's
crazy.
Why
would
You're
so
hot.
That's
a
scary
mask,
bro.
I
had
never
felt
this
feeling
before.
I
could
hear
my
heartbeat
in
my
ears.
My
stomach
felt
like
it
was
I
had
this
lump
in
my
throat
like
I
hated
Regina.
I
hated
her!
She
took
him
back.
Regina
took
Aaron
back.
-
Oh,
no,
Cady.
Because
she's
a
life-ruiner.
She
ruins
people's
lives.
When
we
were
13,
she
made
-
saying
that
Janis
was...
Look,
she's
not
gonna
get
away
-
We're
gonna
do
something.
Regina
George
is
an
evil
dictator.
Now,
how
do
you
overthrow
a
dictator?
You
cut
off
her
resources.
Regina
would
be
nothing
without
...technically
good
physique...
...and
ignorant
band
of
loyal
followers.
Now,
Cady,
if
we
want
this
to
work,
you
are
gonna
have
to
keep
hanging
Can
you
do
it?
I
can
do
it.
OK,
let's
rock
this
bitch.
Pretending
like
nothing
was
wrong
Regina
wanted
me
to
tell
you
that
she
but
he
was
just
interested
And
that's
not
Regina's
fault.
-
No,
I
know.
-
God,
no.
Because
Regina
wanted
me
It's
called
and
all
you
drink
is
This
isn't
even
cranberry
juice.
It's
cranberry
juice
cocktail.
-
I
wanna
lose
3
pounds.
Why
do
you
wear
your
hair
like
that?
Cady,
will
you
please
tell
him
Regina
was
dangling
Aaron
I
knew
how
this
would
be
But
this
was
Girl
World.
Your
hair
looks
sexy
pushed
back.
And
in
Girl
World,
All
this
cranberry
juice
Wait.
I
have
this
really
good
OK.
We
kept
our
eyes
open
Regina.
-
Here
you
go.
-
Hey.
Your
face
smells
like
peppermint.
This
is
ass,
you
guys.
It's
been
a
month,
and
all
we've
done
I've
been
really
busy
with
choir.
We
gotta
crack
Gretchen
Wieners.
We
crack
Gretchen,
on
Regina's
whole
dirty
history.
-
Say
"crack"
again.
-
All
right,
let's
reconvene
tonight.
I
have
to
go
to
Regina's
-
We're
doing
a
dance
to
this
song...
You
guys
know
that
song?
Everybody
in
the
English-speaking
They
do
it
every
year.
Well,
I
have
to
learn
it.
Go.
-
Hey.
I
don't
know,
I
mean,
she's
so
weird.
She
just,
you
know,
came
up
to
me
She's
so
pathetic.
Let
me
tell
you
something
We
were
best
friends
I
know,
right?
It's
so
embarrassing.
So
then
in
eighth
grade,
I
started
Kyle,
who
was
totally
gorgeous,
And
Janis
was,
like,
Like,
if
I
would
blow
her
off
she'd
be
like,
And
I'd
be
like,
"Why
are
you
So
then,
for
my
birthday
party,
I
was
like,
"Janis,
I
can't
invite
you,
I
mean,
I
couldn't
There
are
gonna
be
girls
there
I
mean,
right?
So
then
her
mom
called
my
mom
It
was
so
retarded.
And
then
she
dropped
out
of
school
When
she
came
back
all
of
her
hair
was
cut
off
and
now
I
guess
she's
on
crack.
Oh,
my
God!
Where
did
you
get
it?
It
was
my
mom's
in
the
'80s.
Vintage.
So
adorable.
Thanks.
That
is
the
ugliest
F-ing
skirt
Oh,
my
God,
I
love
your
bracelet.
So
are
you
gonna
send
No.
I
don't
send
them,
So
you
better
send
me
one,
byotch.
Love
you.
I
was
definitely
sending
her
one.
I
was
gonna
use
three
candy
canes
Three,
please.
"Why,
Man,
he
doth
bestride
might
translate
into
"Why
is
he
so
huge
-
Candy
cane-grams!
Taylor
Zimmerman?
Glenn
Cocco?
Four
for
you,
Glenn
Cocco.
And
Cady
Heron.
Do
we
have
a
Cady
Heron
here?
-
It's
Cady.
One
for
you.
And
none
Who's
that
from?
"Thanks
for
being
such
That's
so
sweet.
OK,
back
to
Caesar.
Once
Gretchen
thought
the
secrets
started
pouring
out.
All
I
had
to
do
was
wait
for
one
Thank
you.
Welcome
to
the
North
Shore
Let
me
hear
you
make
some
noise.
All
right,
settle
down.
Our
first
act
calls
himself
Let's
hear
it
for
Damian.
Don't
look
at
me.
Every
day
is
so
wonderful
I
mean,
why
would
Regina
send
Maybe
she
forgot
about
you.
Yeah,
Regina
has
been
acting
I
mean,
is
something
bothering
her?
Well,
I
mean,
her
parents
totally
if
that's
what
you
mean.
Oh,
my
God.
I
am
beautiful
in
every
single
way
Yes,
words
can't
bring
me
down
Yes,
words
can't
bring
me
down
Don't
you
bring
me
down
today
I
mean,
no
offense,
but
why
would
she
send
She
doesn't
even
Maybe
she
feels
weird
around
me
because
I'm
the
only
person
Oh,
my
God.
Yo,
yo,
yo
All
you
sucker
MCs
From
my
grades
to
my
lines
I'm
a
Mathlete
but
forget
what
you
heard
Shaken
not
stirred
The
G
is
silent
And
make
love
to
your
woman
I
don't
play
it
like
Shaggy
because
the
next
time
you
see
her
-
Kevin
G!
Happy
holidays,
everybody.
K.G.
And
the
Power
of
Three.
That
was
something.
Does
it
bother
you
that
they
still
Shut
up.
Damn.
-
What?
shaking
that
thing.
Gretchen,
switch
sides
with
Cady.
But
I'm
always
on
your
left.
That
was
when
there
were
three
of
us,
But
the
whole
dance
I'm
always
on
your
left.
And
right
now
you're
getting
And
finally,

-
Hey,
good
job,
Africa.
Cady's
blushing.
Oh,
my
God.
-
You
totally
have
a
crush
on
that
guy.
That's
why
you
wanted
Mathletes?
You
hate
math.
Look
how
red
she
is.
You
love
him.
And
he
totally
That
is
so
fetch.
Gretchen,
stop
trying
It's
not
going
to
happen.
"Why
should
Caesar
get
to
stomp
"while
the
rest
of
us
try
not
to
get
"What's
so
great
about
Caesar?
"Brutus
is
just
as
cute
as
Caesar.
"OK,
Brutus
is
just
"People
totally
like
Brutus
just
"And
when
did
it
become
"to
be
the
boss
of
everybody?
"Because
that's
not
"We
should
totally
just
stab
Caesar!"
Gretchen
Wieners
had
cracked.
OK,
if
you
even
knew
how
mean
You
know
that
I'm
not
allowed
Yeah.
Two
years
ago,
she
told
me
and
that
I
wasn't
allowed
And
then
for
my
Hanukkah,
of
really
expensive
white-gold
hoops.
And
I
had
to
pretend
and
it
was
so
sad.
And
you
know
she
cheats
on
Aaron?
Yes.
Every
Thursday
he
thinks
But
really,
she's
hooking
up
with
above
the
auditorium,
and
I
never
told
anybody
that,
...l'm
such
a
good
friend.
Jackpot.
Gretchen's
secret
After
Christmas
break,
to
help
Aaron
catch
Regina
Hey.
Hey,
what's
up?
My
purse!
Looks
like
he's
headed
above
the
auditorium!
Coach
Carr?
Trang
Pak?
Guys,
why
did
we
think
Guys,
why
did
we
think
No,
we
just
have
to
regroup.
What
are
Klteen
bars?
They're
these
weird
My
mom
used
to
give
them
to
the
kids
They're
these
weird
nutrition
bars
Give
me
it.
It's
all
in,
like,
Swedish
or
something.
Yeah,
you
know,
there's
some
that's
not
legal
in
the
U.S.
Yet.
-
Ephedrine?
-
Phentermine.
It
burns
carbs.
I
really
wanna
lose
3
pounds.
Oh,
my
God,
You're
so
skinny.
Shut
up.
The
weird
thing
about
was
that
I
could
hate
her,
I
still
wanted
her
to
like
me.
OK.
You
have
really
-
Thanks.
Same
with
Gretchen.
the
more
Gretchen
She
knew
it
was
better
to
be
than
to
not
be
in
at
all.
Because
being
with
The
Plastics
People
looked
at
you
all
the
time,
and
everybody
That
new
girl
I
saw
Cady
Heron
wearing
so
I
bought
Army
pants
That
Cady
girl
is
hot.
She
might
even
be
hotter
I
hear
Regina
George
The
two
were
seen
canoodling
They've
been
inseparable
ever
since.
I
was
a
woman
possessed.
I
spent
about
80
percent
And
the
other
20
percent
I
was
praying
for
someone
so
I
could
talk
about
her
more.
She's
not
even
that
good-looking
I
don't
know.
she's
got
pretty
big
jugs.
I
could
hear
people
But
I
couldn't
stop.
It
just
kept
I
have
this
theory
that
if
you
cut
all
her
Yeah,
I
know.
Hey,
I'm
having
an
art
show.
So
why
don't
you
take
-
I
want
you
to
see
it.
What
is
that
smell?
Oh,
Regina
gave
me
some
perfume.
You
smell
like
a
baby
prostitute.
Thanks.
Meanwhile,
I
was
finding
any
excuse
I
don't
get
this.
Nice
job,
Cady.
Kind
of
seems
like
you
get
it.
If
I
was
gonna
keep
this
going,
Not
your
best.
Damn,
Africa,
what
happened?
-
How'd
you
do?
You
know,
I
think
I
need
a
tutor.
I'll
tutor
you,
if
you
ever
wanna
get
Do
you
think
Regina
would
mind?
No.
You
guys
are
friends.
Well,
maybe
we
just
won't
tell
her.
So,
what
did
you
get
for
this
one?
Well,
the
first
time
I
did
it,
-
Wrong.
...one.
I
got
one
too.
Yeah,
you
have
to
check
it
of
two
negative
integers
Yeah,
like
negative
four
That's
right.
That's
good.
Well,
you're
a
good
tutor.
Man,
look,
I...
I
can't
do
this.
-
It's
not
fair
to
Regina.
Look,
I
know
she
can
be
really
-
Then
why
do
you
like
her?
Look,
there's
good
and
bad
Regina's
just...
-
She's
just
more
up-front
about
it.
The
word
vomit.
She's
cheating
on
you!
What?
Did
he
say
why?
Somebody
told
him
Who?
He
said
some
guy
Baseball
team?
I
gave
him
everything.
You
wanna
do
something
fun?
You
wanna
go
to
Taco
Bell?
I
can't
go
to
Taco
Bell,
God,
Karen,
you
are
so
stupid!
Regina,
wait.
Talk
to
me.
-
Nobody
understands
me.
You're
not
stupid,
Karen.
No.
I
am,
actually.
I'm
failing
almost
everything.
Well,
there
must
be
something
I
can
put
my
whole
fist
Wanna
see?
No.
That's
OK.
Anything
else?
I'm
kind
of
psychic.
I
have
a
fifth
sense.
-
What
do
you
mean?
My
breasts
can
always
tell
Really?
That's
amazing.
Well,
they
can
tell
when
it's
raining.
I
have
to
admit,
when
Aaron
didn't
immediately
I
mean,
I
know
he
was
sad,
Regina
had
moved
on.
Do
you
guys
need
anything?
A
condom?
Let
me
know.
But
overall,
the
plan
Aaron
had
dumped
Regina,
eating
5,000
calories
a
day.
It
was
time
to
turn
our
attention
And
finally,
the
nominees
for
And
finally,
the
nominees
for
Regina
George.
Gretchen
Wieners.
Janis
lan.
What
is
happening
to
the
world?
And
the
final
nominee...
I
couldn't
help
myself.
...
is
Cady
Heron.
Damian,
you
put
me
in
there
too?
I
didn't
put
you
in
there.
You
mean
I'm
really
nominated?
In
January,
Regina
had
put
at
a
store
called
1-3-5.
But
being
Plastic,
before
she
could
actually
buy
it.
Can
someone
zip
me
up?
-
It
won't
close.
OK,
it
must
be
marked
wrong.
Cady,
all
I've
been
eating
are
No,
no,
this
is
just
how
they
work.
This
is
all
your
water
weight.
First
you
bloat,
and
then
you
Well,
the
Klteen
bars
and
now
your
body's
But
once
the
water's
gone,
It
explains
it
all
on
the
label.
You
know
Swedish?
Yeah,
everyone
in
Africa
Ma'am,
do
you
have
this
Sorry.
We
only
carry
You
could
try
Sears.
Cady.
I
need
your
parents
to
sign
this
Failing?
You
know
what's
weird
is
that
all
the
work
is
right
-
Really?
Cady,
I
know
that
having
a
boyfriend
may
seem
like
the
most
important
but
you
don't
have
to
dumb
yourself
-
How
would
you
know?
"How
would
I
know",
right?
I'm
divorced.
The
only
guy
that
ever
calls
my
house
And
you
know
why?
Because
I'm
a
pusher.
I
pushed
my
husband
into
law
school.
I
pushed
myself
And
now
I'm
gonna
push
you
because
I
know
Thanks,
Ms.
Norbury.
for
extra
credit,
please
let
me
know.
Oh,
I
will.
I
hate
her!
I
mean,
she's
totally
because
I
didn't
join
She
was
so
queer.
She
was
like,
"I'm
a
pusher,
Cady.
What
does
that
even
mean?
-
Like
a
drug
pusher?
She
said
she
works
three
jobs.
You
know,
I
bet
she
sells
drugs
to
pay
for
her
pathetic
divorce.
You
let
it
out,
honey.
Put
it
in
the
book.
I
know
it
may
look
but
that's
only
because
Hey,
I
called
you
last
night.
Oh,
I
got
busy.
Sorry.
So
you
need
a
ride
to
my
art
show
No.
I
have
to
go
to
Madison
I'm
so
sorry.
Well,
you
wanna
Can't.
I'm
doing
major
But
we
don't
have
anything
Oh,
I
planned
this
one
on
my
own.
Love
you.
Bye.
Gretchen
thinks
you're
mad
at
her
because
she's
running
Oh,
my
God,
I'm
not
mad
at
her.
I
think
somebody
nominated
her
And
when
nobody
votes
for
her,
And
who's
gonna
have
So
you
don't
think
Cady,
she's
not
pretty.
I
mean,
that
sounds
bad,
The
Spring
Fling
Queen
And
the
crazy
thing
is
but
people
forget
about
her
Anyway,
I
gotta
go.
Well,
she's
not
mad
at
you.

Hold

Hello?

want
me

No.

Hello?
OK.
Hold

Don't

Gretchen.

Hold
on.
It's
Regina.
She
wants
to
hang
out
with
me
Do
not
hang
out
with
her.
-
Why?
You
can
tell
me.
Hold
on.
Oh,
my
God,
Who
is?
-
Who's
this?
Right.
Hold
on.
-
Oh,
my
God,
she's
so
annoying.
OK.
What
is
it?
Regina
says
everyone
hates
you
She
said
that?
You
didn't
hear
it
from
me.
-
Little
harsh,
Gretch.
I
can't
go
out.
I'm
sick.
Boo.
You
whore.
Regina,
we
have
to
talk
to
you.
Is
butter
a
carb?
Yes.
Regina,
you're
wearing
sweatpants.
It's
Monday.
-
So?
and
you
can't
sit
with
us.
Whatever.
Those
rules
aren't
real.
They
were
real
-
Because
that
vest
was
disgusting.
These
sweatpants
are
all
Fine.
You
can
walk
home,
bitches.
Watch
where
you're
going,
fat-ass!
Gretchen
and
Karen
followed
me
-
So,
what
are
we
doing
this
weekend?
Oh,
I
have
to
go
to
Madison
What...?
We
have
tickets
for
this
thing.
-
What?
Was
I
the
new
queen
bee?
I
can
try
and
get
out
of
it.
-
Yeah.
Because
I
told
my
friend
Janis
We've
had
these
tickets
for
months.
You
love
Ladysmith
Black
Mambazo.
But
she's
my
friend,
I
think
Cady's
old
enough
I
had
learned
how
to
control
Hey.
I'm
having
a
small
get-together
-
Is
Regina
going?
No,
it's
just
gonna
be
and
you
better
be
-
Fine,
I'll
go.
I
love
that
shirt
on
you.
Aaron
Samuels
was
going
to
be
Everything
had
to
be
perfect.
And
this
time
when
Aaron
saw
me,
I
wouldn't
be
caught
Hey,
guys.
-
You
look
awesome!
I
know,
right?
OK,
so
I
got
enough
cheese
Do
you
think
that's
enough?
-
Yeah.
OK.
It
was
not
enough.
Somehow,
the
word
had
gotten
out
Jason
is
here
with
Taylor
Wedell.
He's
just
using
her
-
Have
you
guys
seen
Aaron
yet?
Dude,
put
on
-
Do
I
know
you?
She
thinks
she's
gonna
have
-
Who
does
she
think
she
is?
I,
like,
invented
her,
Jason.
I
have
to
talk
to
you.
Whatever.
-
I
love
you.
Hey!
Put
that
down!
Was
Aaron
blowing
me
off?
What's
up?
-
Oh,
no.
I
don't
wanna
hurt
your
feelings,
I
have
to
pee.
Get
out.
-
Hey.
I've
been
looking
Me
too.
You
look...
-
New
clothes?
You
wanna
go
downstairs?
No,
no.
Let's
stay
here.
Thanks
for
getting
me
Yeah,
sure,
no
problem.
I
wasted
too
much
time
No
more
liars.
I
would
never
lie
to
you.
I
know,
I
know.
Although...
OK,
listen.
but
you're
totally
gonna
laugh
Tell
me
what?
I
pretended
to
be
bad
at
math
But
the
thing
is,
I'm
actually
really
good
at
math.
Anyways,
now
I'm
failing.
Wait.
You're
failing
on
purpose?
No.
Not
on
purpose.
I
just
wanted
a
reason
to
talk
to
you.
So
why
didn't
you
just
talk
to
me?
Well,
because
I
couldn't.
Because
you
were
her
property...
-
Her
property?
No,
don't
tell
me
to
shut
up.
-
I
wasn't...
You
are
just
like
a
clone
of
Regina.
Oh,
no,
no,
listen
to
me.
Oh,
no.
It
was
coming
up
again.
-
What
is
this?!
Aaron!
Aaron,
wait!
Just...
OK.
Call
me.
-
Oh,
God.
I'm
sorry.
I
can
explain.
Explain
how
you
forgot
Janis,
I
cannot
stop
this
car.
You
know
I
couldn't
invite
you.
Hey,
buddy,
you're
not
You're
Plastic.
Curfew,
1
a.m.
It
is
now
1:10.
Did
you
have
an
awesome
time?
Did
you
drink
awesome
shooters
and
then
just
sit
around
and
soak
up
You're
the
one
who
made
me
like
this
so
you
could
use
me
God!
See,
at
least
me
and
You
try
to
act
like
you're
so
innocent.
"with
all
the
little
birdies
You
know
what?
It's
not
my
fault
-
What?!
See?
That
is
the
thing
You
think
that
everybody
when
actually,
everybody
hates
you.
Like
Aaron
Samuels,
for
example.
He
broke
up
with
Regina
He
still
doesn't
want
you.
So
why
are
you
still
messing
Because
you
are
a
mean
girl!
Here.
You
can
have
this.
And
I
want
my
pink
shirt
back!
I
want
my
pink
shirt
back!
Hon,
slow
down.
It's
like
I
can't
trust
anyone
anymore.
Why
are
you
eating
a
Klteen
bar?
-
I'm
starving.
Coach
Carr
makes
us
eat
those
when
What?
They
make
you
gain
weight
like
crazy.
Mother...
This
girl
is
the
nastiest
skank
bitch
I've
ever
met.
Do
not
trust
her.
She
is
a
fugly
slut!
I
found
it
in
the
girls'
bathroom.
Is
this
true?
Trang
Pak
made
out
with
Coach
Carr?
Good
Lord.
What's
that
say?
Fat
whore.
OK,
calm
down,
Miss
George.
Why
would
someone
write
that?
Don't
worry,
we're
gonna
There's
only
three
girls
At
your
age,
you're
gonna
You're
gonna
want

touch
each
other,
Coach

Cady
Heron,
they
wanna
see
you
All
right,
chlamydia.
K-L-A...
In
here,
Miss
Heron.
-
What's
going
on?
-
Have
you
ever
seen
this
before?
I
mean,
yes,
I've
seen
it
before,
You
better
get
your
story
straight,
because
I'm
not
messing
It's
not
ours,
it's
Regina's.
Yeah,
she's
trying
to
make
it
look
Miss
Wieners,
why
would
Regina
Miss
Smith,
this
is
no
time
We're
gonna
get
to
the
bottom
Maybe
we're
not
in
that
book,
And
I
don't
wanna
be
punished
And
I
don't
think
my
father,
would
be
too
pleased
"Made
out
with
a
hot
dog"?
Oh,
my
God,
that
was
one
time!
"Dawn
Schweitzer
has
a
huge
ass"?
Who
wouldn't
write
that?
"Trang

And
so
did
Sun
Jin
Dinh.
Hey!
Hey!
Settle
down!
No.
You
do
not
push
and
sh...
Do
you
have
anything
else
No,
I
can't
answer
any
until
I
have
a
parent
Miss
Smith?
Whoever
wrote
it
probably
didn't
I
hope
that
nobody
else
Mom,
can
you
pick
me
up?
-
"Janis
lan,
dyke"?
-
"Too
gay
to
function"?!
That's
only
OK
when
I
say
it.
-
Did
you
write
this?
-
Then
you
told
somebody!
-
You
little
bitch!
Yeah!
Take
your
top
off!
-
Now,
here's
what
we're
gonna
do...
They've
gone
wild.
It
was
full-tilt
jungle
madness.
And
it
wasn't
going
away.
Hey,
I
pulled
these
two
off
each
other.
Coach
Carr,
step
away
Let
me
help
you
down
there.
Hell,
no!
I
did
not
leave
Oh,
crap!
My
hair!
All
junior
girls
report
to
the
gymnasium
Have
you
ever
walked
up
to
people
and
realized
they
were
just
Have
you
ever
had
it
happen
I
have.
Never
in
my
14
years
as
an
educator
And
from
young
ladies.
I
got
parents
calling
me
on
the
phone
I
ought
to
cancel
your
Spring
Fling.
No!
-
No.
Now,
I'm
not
gonna
do
that,
But
don't
think
that
I'm
not
taking
Coach
Carr
has
fled
school
property.
Ms.
Norbury
has
been
Now,
what
the
young
ladies
is
an
attitude
makeover.
And
you're
gonna
get
it
right
now.
I
don't
care
how
long
it
takes,
We
can't
keep
them
past
4.
I
will
keep
you
here
until
4.
Now,
what
we're
gonna
try
to
do
relate
to
each
other.
OK?
Lady
to
lady.
So
who
has
a
lady
problem
Yes?
Somebody
wrote
in
that
book
because
I
use
super-jumbo
tampons.
But
I
can't
help
it
if
I've
got
Yeah,
I
can't
do
this.
Ms.
Norbury.
You're
a
successful,
intelligent,
I
am?
There
has
to
be
something
Something
to
help
them
It's
not
a
self-esteem
problem.
I
think
they're
all
pretty
OK.
OK.
Everybody
close
your
eyes.
I
want
you
to
raise
your
hand
say
something
bad
Open
your
eyes.
Now,
close
your
eyes
again.
And
this
time,
I
want
you
to
raise
said
anything
about
a
friend
Open
them.
There's
been
some
OK.
So,
what
we
could
do
today
express
your
anger
in
a
healthy
way.
Let's
start
over
here.
Ms.
Norbury
had
us
confront
about
the
things
And
it
seemed
like
every
clique
You've
been
acting
really
stuck-up
And
Dawn
agrees
with
me.
-
Dawn?
I'm
pitching
tomorrow.
OK.
Good.
Can
I
just
say
that
we
don't
have
And
some
of
us
shouldn't
have
to
take
are
just
victims
in
this
situation.
That's
probably
true.
have
ever
felt
personally
Good.
OK,
who's
next?
Who's
next?
Cady.
Do
you
have
anything
Yes.
You
never
made
up
a
rumor
Just
that
you
sell
drugs.
No.
Nothing
you
want
to
apologize
for?
I
couldn't
apologize
to
Ms.
Norbury
without
getting
blamed
No.
I'm
really
disappointed
in
you,
Cady.
OK,
so
we're
all
here
Well,
I
don't
know
but
you
all
have
got
to
stop
It
just
makes
it
OK
for
guys
Who
here
has
ever
been
called
a
slut?
OK,
everybody
up.
Ms.
Norbury
had
us
to
people
that
we'd
hurt
in
our
lives.
"Alyssa,
I'm
sorry
I
called
you
"It's
not
your
fault
"Gretchen,
"I'm
sorry
I
laughed
"at
Barnes
and
Noble.
"And
I'm
sorry
I
told
everyone
about
it."
And
I'm
sorry
for
repeating
it
now.
Laura,
I
don't
hate
you
You're
fat
because
I
hate
you.
I
just
wish
we
could
all
get
along
I
wish
that
I
could
bake
a
cake
and
we'd
all
eat
it
and
be
happy.
She
doesn't
even
go
here!
Do
you
even
go
to
this
school?
No.
I
just
have
a
lot
of
feelings.
OK,
go
home.
Sharon,
I
think
you're
doing
Thanks.
I
feel
like
I'm
getting
through.
I'm
sorry
that
people
But
I
can't
help
it
that
I'm
popular.
Oh,
my
God!
Oh,
jeez.
OK.
That
hurt.
They're
OK.
They're
OK.
Oh,
boy.
OK,
who's
next?
Oh,
my
God.
It's
her
dream
come
true,
OK,
yeah,
I've
got
an
apology.
So
I
have
this
friend
And
I
convinced
her
that
it
would
be
So
I
had
her
pretend
and
then
she
would
come
and
we
would
just
laugh
about
And
we
gave
her
that
would
make
her
gain
weight,
and
we
turned
her
best
friends
And
then...
Oh,
yeah,
Cady...
She
made
out
and
then
convinced
him
Oh,
God,
and
we
gave
you
foot
cream
God!
I
am
so
sorry,
Regina.
Really,
I
don't
know
why
I
did
it.
I
guess
it's
probably
because
Suck
on
that!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Janis!
Regina!
Regina,
wait!
I
didn't
mean
To
find
out
that
everyone
hates
me?
Regina,
please!
Regina,
stop!
No!
Do
you
know
They
say
that
you're
who's
a
less-hot
version
of
me.
Yeah.
So
don't
try
to
act
so
innocent.
You
can
take
that
fake
apology
And
that's
how
Regina
George
died.
No,
I'm
totally
kidding.
Some
girls
say
they
saw
her
head
But
that's
just
a
rumor.
push
her
in
front
of
the
bus.
-
Everybody
done?
I
don't
know
what
to
believe
anymore.
Mom,
believe
me.
Why
are
my
tribal
vases
My
tribal
vases.
I
don't
know.
This
is
the
fertility
vase
-
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you?
Who
are
you?
Great.
All
my
friends
hate
me,
Your
mom
does
not
hate
you.
She's
afraid
of
you.
I
don't
know,
maybe
we
Maybe
you
should
come
back
and
No.
Only
thing
worse
than
How
bad's
it
gonna
be
tomorrow?
Remember
when
we
saw
those
lions
I'll
be
the
wart
hog.
You're
not
a
wart
hog,
you're
a
lion.
Just
focus
on
your
studies
You're
still
an
excellent
student,
right?
Oh,
yeah.
I
need
you
to
sign
-
Why?
OK.
You
are...
What
do
they
call
it?
Grounded.
You're
grounded.
She
pushed
her
in
front
of
the
bus.
Did
you
see
her
do
it?
Yes.
Did
your
teacher
ever
try
to
sell
you
-
No.
What's
going
on?
Mr.
Duvall,
this
is
ridiculous.
I
know,
Aaron.
But
after
turned
out
to
be
extremely
true,
the
school
board
felt
that
it
was
best
in
this
Burn
Book.
That
book
was
written
who
make
up
rumors
with
their
own
lame
lives.
Well,
unless
someone
wants
to
come
this
is
how
we
have
to
handle
it.
Oh,
no.
Bye,
Aaron.
Mr.
Duvall.
I
wrote
it.
Come
on,
Cady.
When
you
get
bit
by
a
snake,
you're
supposed
to
suck
That's
what
I
had
to
do.
I
started
with
Regina,
who
was
living
proof
that
the
more
the
more
flowers
you
get.
Then
there
was
Ms.
Norbury,
who
was
living
proof
that
no
Oh,
hi.
Did
you
wanna
-
I'm
just
done
with
my
quiz.
I
gotta
say,
watching
the
police

was
the
cherry
on
top
How
much
trouble
did
you
get
in
A
lot.
You
didn't
write
that
whole
book
Did
you
tell
Mr.
Duvall
who
else
did
it?
No,
because
I'm
trying
where
I
don't
talk
about
people
That's
all
right.
