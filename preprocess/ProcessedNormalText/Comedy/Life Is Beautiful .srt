not
an
easy
one

Like

The

And
I
can
resist

The

are
gone!
I
heard
you.
-
No,
they're
really
gone!
Weren't
you
reciting
a
poem?
It
doesn't
work!
Brake!
We're
going
to

Brake!
The

is
coming!
There
he

It's
full
of

down
there.
We

We

Move!
Go

Otherwise,
I
found
the

Now
what
do
you
need?
Nothing.
All
right,
Do
you
want
the
screw
No,
I
want
to
be
alone.
Do
I
toss
out
the
screw
I
need
ten
minutes
alone.
I'm
washing
my

Pretty
girl!
How's
it
going?
What
are
you
doing?
Did
your
mom
put
this
stuff
here?
No,
the
landlady
did.
Is
it
a
market?
It's
beautiful.
How
much
is
it?
-
What's
your
name?
Nice
to
meet
you.
-
Prince?
All
this
is
mine.
Here

the

I'll
call
this

I'll
change

Camels?
Even

I
must
go.

When?
Good
morning,
Princess!
How
frightening.
I've
never
been
better.
Do
you
always
leave
I
wanted
to
burn
that
wasps

A
wasp
stung
you?
There?
Hold
still,
Princess.
A
wasp's
poison
is
very
dangerous.
You
have
to
get
it
out.
-
Lie
down.
It'll
take
a
while.

Did
you
get
stung
anywhere
else?
What
a
