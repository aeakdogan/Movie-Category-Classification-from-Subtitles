Directed by Alfred Hitchcock

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,152
Produced at Welwyn Studios, England

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,281
with the collaboration
of French-speaking writers, artists

4
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,160
and technicians
working in Great Britain

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,579
London, 1943.

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:43,500
Sergeant John Dougall, from the RAF,
who escaped from Germany,

7
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:48,505
is questioned about aspects of his journey
by an Officer of France's Second Bureau.

8
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,263
Come in.

9
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,681
Hello.

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,225
Hello Colonel.
Sergeant Dougall is here.

11
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,603
I'm sorry to bother you
with this story.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,606
But I've spoken to the
Resistance delegation about it.

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,150
- It seemed worth the effort.
- Really?

14
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,736
I believe it's of interest
to you too.

15
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,788
Sit down, old boy.

16
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,208
- Cigarette?
- I'm sorry, sir.

17
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,376
French cigarettes make me cough.

18
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,587
I read your report.
It's very interesting.

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,881
Your escape was a real exploit.

20
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,425
It was Gadovsky
who arranged it all, sir.

21
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,803
He's a really smashing chap.

22
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,679
Did he escape too?

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,640
No, no. He did not escape too.

24
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,934
Oh, I hope
everything is all right for him.

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,144
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,231
You reached Reims without a hitch,
is that correct?

27
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,983
- Excuse me, sir. Without a what?
- Without a hitch.

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,610
Complication, problems.

29
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,487
Ah yes! No problems at all.

30
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,989
It was too good to be true!

31
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,825
Yes. Listen, old boy.

32
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,577
I think it best
that you tell us yourself,

33
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,330
everything that happened to you
from Reims.

34
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,964
I was sure it was too early.
It's your fault Stéphane.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,259
I couldn't have stayed any longer
in that dirty wagon.

36
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,344
Come here, Sandy.

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,186
Let's have a smoke.

38
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,313
You never told me
you still had some left.

39
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,483
Just one.
A poor single cigarette.

40
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,570
That's all that's left
of my packet from the Red Cross.

41
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,365
Go on. There's no danger here.

42
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,659
English cigarettes
are always dangerous!

43
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,828
Where's the message?

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,667
Café du Commerce, Reims.

45
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,461
A café? Great!
We can chow, I'm starving.

46
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,130
Quiet, speak properly.

47
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,424
What? Chow?
That's correct. It's slang.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,802
Yes, but when you use slang
you have even more of an accent.

49
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,888
The message says
that only one of the two of us

50
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,681
is to go the Café du Commerce.

51
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,975
I can't go alone

52
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,687
if you say that I have an accent,
especially when I use slang.

53
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,940
Yes, obviously, you won't find
a lot of Scottish in Reims.

54
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,985
OK, I'll go.
What's the password now?

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,654
Aranciot. Tightly packed
if there's any left.

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,741
I'm not interested,
it doesn't mean anything in Scottish.

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,912
And if you don't bring me back
something to eat, I'll die.

58
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,050
- What is it? Didn't you ask?
- Yes, food and drink.

59
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,135
- A gash.
- What, at the café?

60
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,013
No, everything was fine there.
There weren't too many people.

61
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,514
Nobody signalled to me.

62
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,601
Well, I asked for a drink
and said the password,

63
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,853
what a crazy business.

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,649
- Hey, gently.
- Was it a knife?

65
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,277
Yes, I was followed
as I left the café.

66
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,447
I thought it was someone from
the Resistance, but soon knew better.

67
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,616
- You mean Gestapo?
- Yes, as good as.

68
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,661
One of those bastard Vichy supporters
on the lookout for a reward.

69
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,204
He tried to catch me.

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,666
I got out of there fast as I could.
I thought I'd lost him.

71
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,962
I go to hide in a cellar,
I slip on the steps, he finds me, so...

72
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,172
- Did you get him?
- As dead as a dodo.

73
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,382
I see.

74
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,550
But what if other Vichy supporters
find the body?

75
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,929
- They won't be happy.
- I'm vaguely aware of that.

76
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,516
Stéphane, we have to take care of it
right away. Don't you think?

77
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,519
- Yes, I think so.
- Come. Quickly.

78
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,753
It smells good in here.
What is it?

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,506
- Guess.
- A cellar for plonk.

80
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,924
Can't hide anything from you.

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,928
I say, Stéphane.
We could always get drunk!

82
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,557
Don't get so excited. It's all empty.
The Krauts got here before us.

83
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,684
That's strange.
It was just here that...

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,312
Are you sure that you
finished him off, this chap?

85
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,273
- Certain. Yes.
- You're right.

86
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,569
It's strange. If he was dead,
he couldn't have walked away.

87
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,654
What are you doing here?

88
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,619
Don't worry, young men.
We're friends.

89
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,250
But, you were in the café.

90
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,295
We followed you.
But why have you come back?

91
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,256
- To...
- To hide your handiwork.

92
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,508
Don't worry,
we took care of it.

93
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,720
By the way,
you did a good job.

94
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,889
- He'll not wake again.
- He was a Vichy spy.

95
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,807
Thank you
for the information, son,

96
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,185
but what were you thinking
in the café earlier?

97
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,854
- You're crazy!
- Smoking an English cigarette?

98
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,565
You think it's a packet of Gauloises?

99
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,068
What are you both doing here?

100
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,530
We're prisoners of war.
We want to get to England.

101
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,116
No, it's not true!

102
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,620
My poor boy, you're English!

103
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,288
Scottish. RAF.

104
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,582
- What?
- R-A-F

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,710
That's how they pronounce
RAF over there.

106
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,796
- You're a pilot?
- Air gunner.

107
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,132
Do you think we could get
something to eat?

108
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:29,179
My poor boy, but I thought
you had plenty to eat in England.

109
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,891
Yes, Madame, but it's been a year
since I was last there.

110
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,893
Ah, that's why he's hungry.

111
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,896
Tell me, sir. Could you could do
something for us?

112
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,691
Of course,
but take care not to be seen.

113
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,777
There's a curfew, you know.

114
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,279
We could sleep here,
to wait, maybe.

115
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,907
No, boys.
It's best to leave right away.

116
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,868
- Leave, where to?
- Listen.

117
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,540
It's 1.15am.
I'll tell you what to do.

118
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,834
Go back to the Montigny road.

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,670
Follow it for 2 km
until you get to a bridge.

120
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,256
Got it? Right.

121
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,216
There you'll find
a small stream.

122
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,135
Follow it along the left bank.

123
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,804
It will take you
behind a large farm. Got it?

124
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,350
The road to Montigny for 2km,
a small bridge,

125
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,770
the stream on the left
up to a large farm. Got it.

126
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,982
Right. In the cowshed,
you'll find two bicycles.

127
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,650
I'll phone to arrange that.

128
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,529
And something to eat,
in a small parcel.

129
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,864
Thank you very much,
madame.

130
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,657
And in the handlebars
of the second bicycle,

131
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,493
you'll find a piece of paper
with all the directions you need.

132
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,412
Understood? Right.

133
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,998
Off you go, boys.
And, bon voyage.

134
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,170
You said, it's in the small parcel?

135
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,923
Thank you. Goodbye.
Come on, Sandy, let's go.

136
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,044
It's still quite a way.

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,837
- How far?
- 35 km.

138
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,340
- Oh, I see.
- And we must get there before daybreak.

139
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,550
What's over there? More cows?

140
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:35,222
- No. The Hôtel de la Poste.
- An hotel, really? Let me see.

141
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,309
An hotel! Stéphane,
an hotel with a bed

142
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,145
and perhaps
something more to eat.

143
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,242
Sorry to disturb you.
Do you have your papers?

144
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,410
- You arrived here last night?
- Yes.

145
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,955
- What is it you want?
- Your papers. We're the police.

146
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,918
I'm going to Reims,
I'm a mechanic.

147
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,463
- I come from Ireland.
- Ah, you're Irish.

148
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,591
- A mechanic?
- Yes, my factory was bombed.

149
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,052
Yes, yes. That's fine.
Thank you.

150
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,817
- How did you get away with it?
- With the gendarmes?

151
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,653
- They just asked me a few questions.
- What did you say?

152
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,698
- I said just what you told me to say.
- And it worked?

153
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,075
You know, I'd practised the phrases
a lot with you.

154
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,329
I'm very happy we did that,
because of my Scottish accent.

155
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,998
But these gendarmes here,

156
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,335
they must think that Ireland and Scotland
are the same thing. And you?

157
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,505
It worked perfectly too. Get up now,
old boy, we have to get out of here.

158
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,967
- Yes, yes, before breakfast!
- I've not said a word.

159
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,596
- Are we still going by bicycle?
- No, this time we're taking the train.

160
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,640
The hotel owner has given me
lots of information, he's a good man too.

161
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,309
We'll have to wear these clothes.

162
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,813
We're taking the train at 9:42am.
The second carriage after the engine.

163
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,316
You'll read this paper
in the compartment.

164
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,027
At one point, I'll ask you
if you can lend it to me.

165
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,197
Then, you'll say the password:
"It's Monday's."

166
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,534
Right. The Resistance member
who is supposed to contact us,

167
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,872
will give me their paper, saying,
"Take this one, it's yesterday's."

168
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,083
I see. And they'll tell us
what to do next?

169
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,127
Let's hope so.

170
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,880
Must we really wear
these clothes?

171
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,757
They're filthy.

172
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,072
Excuse me, could you lend me
your newspaper?

173
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,199
It's Monday's.

174
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,576
Take this one, it's yesterday's.

175
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,522
The train driver was also
in the Resistance, probably.

176
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,066
Everything was well organised.

177
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,361
It was exactly
like a combined operation.

178
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,824
And this young woman, tell me,
she took you to a farm.

179
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,785
Yes, sir. Her father's farm.

180
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,037
And so she told us that

181
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:50,125
that very evening there was
a plane heading for England,

182
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:55,714
but that there was only one place
for one of the two of us.

183
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,467
So, you drew straws.

184
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,178
That's right, sir.
But how did you know that?

185
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,056
Because I am very intelligent.

186
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,059
Yes... So, what was I saying?

187
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,772
And so I won, and then Jeanne
gave us some clothes.

188
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,774
And then we ate.

189
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,653
- When does he leave?
- You can never know for sure.

190
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,156
In any case, no later than 3 o'clock
in the morning,

191
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,866
my father will come
to collect him.

192
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,454
- Is it far to walk?
- Oh! Airmen don't like to walk!

193
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,540
No, rest assured,
you'll have a car.

194
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,667
We'll drive you
straight to the plane.

195
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,920
- Just like an AirFrance flight, okay?
- Okay.

196
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,173
There we go.
That'll do for tonight.

197
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,967
- I'll change it for you tomorrow.
- Thank you very much.

198
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,635
I'm feeling much better.

199
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,347
Right, I'm off to bed.

200
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,641
Wake me so that
I can say goodbye to Sandy.

201
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,436
Not goodbye Stéphane...
"see you", I hope.

202
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,731
Goodnight.
And thank you for the dressing.

203
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,370
It's been a long time
since I've had a smoke. Since Reims.

204
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,080
Reims? Yes, I know.

205
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,958
You'd have been better off
not lighting your cigarette.

206
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,543
It did you no favours.

207
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,170
Not to me, but Stéphane.

208
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,589
He was the one who went
to the Café de Commerce in Reims.

209
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,091
Reims? You mean
the Café des Maronniers.

210
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,845
No, Café de Commerce.
I read the instructions too.

211
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,597
And I remember it distinctly.

212
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,474
Ah, Café du Commerce?

213
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,603
That's where this Vichy chap
noticed Stéphane.

214
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:38,066
Then he followed him,
right into the wine cellar.

215
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,735
- Is that the car?
- Yes, yes.

216
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,404
Right. I'll say goodbye
to Stéphane.

217
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,074
Please tell your father
I'll be there right away.

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,625
Tell me, when you left Stéphane,
he gave you a letter, didn't he?

219
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,751
Yes, sir.

220
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,587
And he asked you
to give it to someone here,

221
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,215
in case his departure
was delayed, isn't that so?

222
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,050
Yes, that's right too.

223
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,137
- But how do you know?
- I already told you, I'm very intelligent.

224
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,557
- Have you delivered this letter?
- Yes, sir.

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,061
Can you tell me
the recipient's name and address?

226
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,983
I'm very sorry, sir, but I can't.

227
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,193
I gave my word of honour.

228
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,279
Sergeant, I must warn you

229
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,407
that you should consider
this question an order.

230
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,993
Yes, sir. I see.

231
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,829
But this is not a military matter.

232
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,499
Naturally, we can't force you to tell us
what you don't want to tell us.

233
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,459
This is not the Gestapo here.

234
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,045
But I think I can convince you

235
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,299
that you have a duty
beyond your military duty,

236
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:49,095
and to tell us everything you know,
despite your word of honour.

237
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,265
I'm sorry,
but I really don't think so, sir.

238
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,144
Of course,
after everything you've told me.

239
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,647
You'll think I'm mad or a fool

240
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,233
if I told you
that your friend, Godovsky,

241
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,736
was an officer of the Gestapo.

242
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,239
Yes, sir. I...

243
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,701
Your friend Godovsky,
was not Godovsky at all.

244
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,330
The real Godovsky is still
a prisoner of war in Germany.

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,002
In reality, your friend Godovsky
looked very much like the real Godovsky.

246
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,005
And that's why
the Germans chose him for this job.

247
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,883
The Gestapo are very clever,
you see, old boy.

248
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,929
So clever, that it was they
who organised your escape

249
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:35,099
in collaboration
with the Godovsky impostor, naturally.

250
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,144
I'm afraid that you have been
terribly misinformed, sir.

251
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,481
I see this is not going to be easy.

252
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,192
I'm going to tell you
the end of your story.

253
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,736
It is not for nothing
that I asked you

254
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,697
to begin your story
from when you arrived in Reims.

255
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,241
Do you remember the cart?

256
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,370
Right. You will also remember
that Stéphane had a meeting

257
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,830
with the Resistance
at the Café du Commerce.

258
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,002
But Stéphane had arranged
another meeting,

259
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,631
with one of his friends,
called Oskar Emberg.

260
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,466
You never met Emberg,

261
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,426
but you will have seen him
in the train later on

262
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,097
where he was sat next to Stéphane
reading a paper.

263
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,599
He was in the Gestapo too.

264
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,019
Stéphane was directly
under his command.

265
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,983
But in Reims, the Resistance
had identified them both

266
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,819
and if Stéphane had gone
to the Café du Commerce

267
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,072
it's possible he may not have
come out alive.

268
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,170
He wanted to give up.

269
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:52,552
But Emberg insisted on carrying on,
since it was essential for them

270
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,096
to get you to carry
this message to London.

271
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,187
That's why he took Stéphane,
not to the Café du Commerce

272
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,606
but to the Café des Maronniers.

273
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:17,118
One of the Café des Maronniers regulars
was a minor SEL spy.

274
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,967
It was not by chance that Stéphane
lit an English cigarette.

275
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,763
He may as well have shouted
'Vive De Gaulle' at the Kommandantur.

276
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,765
He had two reasons for this.

277
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,017
To attract the spy's attention

278
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,228
as well as the attention
of the Resistance man and woman.

279
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,898
The ones you later saw
in the cellar.

280
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,917
Stéphane waited until he was sure
they'd taken the bait,

281
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,170
then he left,
followed by the spy,

282
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,924
he himself followed by
the Resistance man and woman.

283
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,855
Emberg's plan had worked.

284
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,070
Stéphane made for the cellar.

285
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,949
Making sure he was indeed
being followed.

286
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,163
The chap from the SEL
was following him.

287
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,120
The spy stupidly asked Stéphane
for his papers,

288
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,207
giving Stéphane an opportunity
he did not waste.

289
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,887
His blow finished him off.

290
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,192
The man was stone dead.

291
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,666
Stéphane left the cellar,
knowing that his plan had worked.

292
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,717
The two Resistance members
had watched him.

293
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,262
Yes, but I don't understand.

294
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,889
If Godovsky was a spy,

295
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,725
why would one spy
want to kill another spy?

296
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,228
To convince people
in the Resistance

297
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,188
that he really was
an escaped prisoner.

298
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,732
- Obviously.
- Oh I see.

299
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,069
You know, old boy, spies are people
quite different to the rest of us.

300
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,528
Yes, I see.

301
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,114
On top of that, he and Emberg

302
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,159
absolutely wanted to get to know
other members of the Resistance.

303
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,372
They were, by then,
collecting new victims.

304
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,624
This man and this woman,

305
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,419
and then the farmers
who provided you with the bicycles.

306
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,673
Then, the owner
of the Hôtel de la Poste.

307
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,008
This all makes
for a sizable number of kills.

308
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,260
Hôtel de la Poste?

309
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,179
You mean to say
that the two gendarmes...

310
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,722
Of course.

311
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,813
Police.

312
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,190
- Bonjour.
- Do you have your papers?

313
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,237
- Ah! Monsieur LeBlanc.
- You're Monsieur LeBlanc.

314
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,240
- Please excuse us, Monsieur LeBlanc.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

315
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,077
Tell me, the gentleman in room number 8,
do you understand?

316
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,996
Understood, sir.

317
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,918
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

318
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,921
- The 9:42am train to Givry.
- Perfect.

319
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,799
I'll be at the Hôtel des Voyageurs
in Arras.

320
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,676
The 9:42am train,

321
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,721
second carriage after the engine,
second compartment.

322
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,597
Understood.

323
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,186
Do you mean to say,
he took me for a spy too?

324
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,521
That's very doubtful.

325
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,191
On the contrary, for them
you were an unexpected opportunity.

326
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,360
I find it all very difficult to believe.

327
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,864
- I must have seen Emberg.
- Certainly you saw him.

328
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,293
And now, we get to the farm.

329
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,629
Godovksy, of course,
lost on purpose.

330
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,256
Luckily for you,

331
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,552
he needed you to carry
the precious message to England.

332
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,181
That's why he made you promise
to say goodbye to him.

333
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,368
- Is the RAF man ready?
- In a second, father.

334
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,286
You know Jeanne,
we were followed in the train today.

335
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,790
- No kidding.
- A guy from the Gestapo.

336
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,416
Anyway, our friends
have taken care of him.

337
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,377
- Was he alone?
- Yes.

338
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,297
That's strange.
They usually work in pairs.

339
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,137
Please excuse me
for putting you out like this.

340
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,556
- It's nothing.
- Oh, thank you.

341
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,602
- There we go.
- Goodbye, mademoiselle.

342
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,146
Thank you for everything.

343
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,315
I very much hope
to see you again.

344
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:25,444
Adieu, RAF. Bon voyage.

345
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,280
Let's go. Quickly.

346
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,292
Reims 776.

347
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,587
Hello. Café du Commerce.

348
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,227
I'll not keep you waiting.
Let's just wait for the car to leave.

349
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,621
Arras 18.

350
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,424
Hello, number 18.
Hôtel des Voyageurs?

351
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,051
I'd like to speak to Mr Emberg.

352
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,817
Hello, Oskar. Good evening.

353
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,944
The pigeon has flown.

354
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,406
The message
nicely tucked under its wing.

355
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,242
You'd like me to join you? Fine.

356
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,621
Yes, I'm waiting for you.

357
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,165
Good evening.

358
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,566
You're thinking
about poor Jeanne, aren't you Sandy?

359
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,276
Yes.

360
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:34,532
I told her I'd see her again
after the war.

361
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,492
Yes, old boy.
All this is terrible.

362
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,285
But perhaps in France,

363
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,663
there will be a new tomb
under the Arc de Triomphe,

364
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,873
dedicated to the unknown civilian.
